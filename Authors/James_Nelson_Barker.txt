'''James Nelson Barker''' (June 17, 1784 – March 9, 1858) was an American [[soldier]], [[playwright]] and [[politician]]. He rose to the rank of major in the Army during the [[War of 1812]], wrote ten plays, and was [[mayor of Philadelphia]].

==Early life==
Barker was born on June 17, 1784, in [[Philadelphia]]. He was the fourth son<ref name=Musser>Musser, Paul H. ''James Nelson Barker, 1784-1858; With a Reprint of His Comedy Tears and Smiles''. University of Pennsylvania P; London, H. Milford:Oxford UP, 1929</ref> of [[John Barker (Philadelphia)|John Barker]], and Mary Nelson, who were married on July 13, 1769.<ref>Musser 1929, 7</ref> His education was limited, for though he attended local schools, he spent more time reading books than studying.<ref>Gates, Robert Allen, Ed.</ref> However, Barker's father ensured that his son was educated in gentlemanly etiquette and the ability to defend himself with a sword or pistol.<ref>Gates, Robert Allan</ref> Barker began writing in 1804. ''The Spanish Rover'' was a three-act play based on Cervantes. However, only one act was completed,<ref>Musser 1929, 13</ref> and eventually burned.<ref>Quinn 1943, 137</ref> His studies were also challenged by travel. He joined an expedition to the [[West Indies]] in 1806, much to his parents' unease.<ref>Gates, Robert Allen, Ed. ''18th- and 19th- Century Drama''. New York: Irvington Publishers, 1984. P. 121.

In September 1808, Barker joined "The Democratic Young Men", a Philadelphia political organization. His involvement in the organization led to his naming as a member of vigilance to supervise the voting at the election, which led to the Democratic control of councils. This control then led to his father's second term as mayor of the city<ref name=Musser/> from 1812 to 1813.<ref name="Young, John Russell 1895. P. 443"/> In 1809, 25-year-old Barker was sent by his father to Washington to gain political experience and to prepare for a political career.<ref name = "Crowley">Crowley, John W. "James Nelson Barker in Perspective", ''Educational Theater Journal'' '''24'''.4, P. 364. Print.</ref> This visit served both to train him in politics and to give him political contacts, as he was invited to meet with [[James Madison]].<ref name=Musser/> In 1811, Barker married [[Mary Rogers]].<ref>Musser 1929, 43</ref> His daughter, Rachel Jackson Mary Barker, was named after [[Andrew Jackson]]'s wife [[Rachel Jackson]].<ref>''History of Baltimore, Maryland, From its Founding as a Town to the Current Year 1729-1898''.

==Literary influence==
Barker's plays show awareness of the problems with the government's attitude that it was the center of the new America's society.<ref>Wilmeth, Don B. and Bigsby, Christopher, eds. ''The Cambridge History of American Theatre Volume 1: Beginnings to 1870''. United Kingdom: Cambridge UP, 1998. Print</ref> He sought to demonstrate that the American experience could be used to shape national identity.<ref>Crowley 1972, 364</ref> He considered himself to be an American playwright who was committed to exploring native subjects and themes.<ref>Miller, Tice</ref> His work reflected the conflict for American authors in finding their own native voice.<ref>Bryer and Hartig 2010, 55</ref> He believed that American artistic tastes should be independent of those of Europe, and condemned Americans' feelings of inferiority.<ref>Miller 2007, 43</ref> He took the position that American art was to be both democratic and useful.<ref>name=Crowley</ref> Two of Barker's most popular plays were ''The Indian Princess'' and ''Marmion''.<ref>name=Miller</ref> ''Superstition'' is considered one of Barker's best plays.<ref name=":0" />

===The Indian Princess===
{{main|The Indian Princess (play)}}
''The Indian Princess''; or, ''La Belle Sauvage'' (1808), is a melodrama about the Pocahontas story. Though originally written as a play, Barker decided to turn it into an operatic melodrama,<ref name="Hitchcock, H. Wiley">Hitchcock, H. Wiley</ref> collaborating  with the English<ref>Richards, Jeffrey H. ''Drama, Theatre and Identity in the American New Republic'', New York: Cambridge UP, 2005. P.169.

New York: Penguin Books 1997, P. 109. Print.</ref> (''Ponteach'' from 1766, for example, was a play about Native Americans that was never produced).<ref name="Quinn 1943, 139">Quinn 1943, 139</ref> It was also the first original American play to be produced in London after being premiered in America.<ref name="Hitchcock, H. Wiley"/> However, according to the American music scholar [[H. Wiley Hitchcock]], the London production was "a bowdlerized version" of the original.<ref>Hitchcock, H. Wiley. "An Early American Melodrama: The Indian Princess of J. N. Barker and John Bray". ''Notes: Second Series'' 12.3, P 375. Print.</ref> In a letter of June 10, 1832, to [[William Dunlap]], Barker said that the London production at [[Drury Lane]] "differs essentially from mine in the plan and arrangement".<ref name="Hitchcock, H. Wiley"/> It was premiered at The Chestnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia.<ref>Miller, Tice L. ''Entertaining the Nation: American Drama in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries''. Carbondale: Southern Illinois UP, 2007. P. 43. Print</ref> It is based on Captain [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]]'s ''Generall Historie of Virginia'' (1624),<ref>Richards 1997, 109-110</ref> though he used Smith's text freely.<ref name="Richards 1997, 169">Richards 1997, 169</ref> Its New York premiere was at the Park Theatre on June 14, 1809.<ref name="Quinn 1943, 139"/> It satisfied intrigue for both American and English audiences regarding the figure of the Native American.<ref>Vickers 2002, 215</ref> Even though romantic conquest takes precedence over colonial conquest, it is evident that the connection between the two is strong.<ref name=Scheckel>Scheckel, Susan. "Domesticating the Drama of Conquest: Barker's Pocahontas on the Popular Stage", ''American Theater Quarterly'' '''10'''.3 (1996). Print</ref> ''The Indian Princess'' gained popularity due to a search for a national identity, as American history was becoming more popular.<ref name="Richards 1997, 169"/> As Susan Scheckel wrote, "In bringing Pocahontas to the popular stage, James Nelson Barker enlisted the conventions of melodrama to produce a romanticized version of American history that resolved conflicts implicit in past acts of conquest and revolution and defined national identity in terms that reinforced a sense of moral and cultural integrity."<ref name=Scheckel/> Though historical accuracy is overshadowed by romantic melodrama, Barker was aware that that was what his audience wanted, as they were accustomed to romantic melodramas from England.<ref>Richards 1997, 173</ref> As Jeffrey H. Richards noted, "In Barker, the Native Americans are identified specifically with a history of the North American mainland and a people that spectators in 1808 would easily identify as Indian."<ref>Richards 1997, 174-175</ref> A common practice of the time was to add music to performances, whether in song or not.<ref name="Richards, Jeffrey H">Richards, Jeffrey H.</ref> Because of the music, audiences flocked to it.<ref name="Richards, Jeffrey H"/><ref>Vickers, Anita</ref>

===Marmion===
''Marmion; or, The Battle of Flodden Field'' (1812), was premiered in New York at the Park Theatre on April 13, 1812.<ref>Quinn 1943, 140</ref> It is a blank-verse dramatization of [[Sir Walter Scott]]'s poem ''[[Marmion (poem)|Marmion]]''. It was premiered in New York because there was already a production in Philadelphia with the same name at the Olympic Theatre.<ref name="Miller 2007, 42">Miller 2007, 42</ref> ''Marmion'' had its Philadelphia premiere on January 1, 1813. Though it is set in sixteenth century England and Scotland, it addressed nineteenth century America and its relationship with England regarding a heated debate with Congress about the imprisonment of American seamen.<ref name="Miller 2007, 42"/> It was initially purposefully attributed to the English dramatist [[Thomas Morton (playwright)|Thomas Morton]], out of fear of disregard for a play by an American. It was believed that when the true playwright was revealed, ticket sales would drop.<ref name="ReferenceA">Bryer, Jackson R. and Hartig, Mary C. Eds</ref><ref>Quinn, Arthur Hobson</ref> However, according to the diary of [[William B. Wood (actor)|William Wood]], who requested that Barker write the play, the ticket sales were as follows:<br>
:Jan. 1, 1813, $1414.75<br>Jan. 2, $357.25<br>Jan. 11, $578<br>Jan. 18, $845<br>Feb. 5, 332<br>Feb. 15, $466.

According to Wood, the truth was revealed after the sixth or seventh performance. Ticket sales remained constant,<ref>Quinn 1943, -140-141</ref> and ''Marmion'' was one of the longest running dramas of Barker's career.<ref>Musser, Paul Howard</ref> By the time ''Marmion'' premiered in Philadelphia, Barker had gone to the Canada–US border as captain of the Second Artillery Regiment.<ref>Quinn 1943, 144</ref>

=== Superstition; or, The Fanatic Father ===
{{Main|Superstition (play)}}''Superstition, or, The Fanatic Father'' (1824) was first staged on the Chestnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia on March 12, 1824.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Best American Plays|last=Gassner|first=John|publisher=Crown Publishers, Inc|year=1967|pages=xxx}}</ref> ''Superstition'' is a melodrama written during the Romanticism movement that took form in America in the early 1800s. According to Allan Gates Halline in his introduction to ''Superstition'' in ''American Plays'', "The appeal to reason and knowledge suggest that Barker was reflecting the rationalistic thought current shortly before and partly during the period in which he was writing."<ref>{{Cite book|title=American Plays|last=Halline|first=Arthur Gates|publisher=American Book Company|year=1935|location=New York|pages=122–123}}</ref> The setting of ''Superstition'' takes place in the Puritan's Massachusetts Bay Colony in the early 17th-century. The play's protagonist, Charles Fitzroy, and his mother, Isabella, are unfairly condemned by the town's Puritan leader, Reverend Ravensworth. After the New England town defends itself from a Native American raid, Charles and Isabella are put on trial and are executed for supposed witchcraft. ''Superstition'' addresses the hypocritical practices of the Puritans as well as glorifying American exceptionalism.<ref>{{Cite book|title=American Plays|last=Halline|first=Allan Gates|publisher=American Book Company|year=1935|location=New York|pages=123}}</ref> While this melodrama does follow many of the common tropes and character archetypes for which 19th-century melodrama was known, Barker subverts many of these expectations by including a tragic ending where the protagonist dies and the antagonist goes unpunished. According to John Gassner's introduction to ''Superstition'' in ''Best American Plays'', "It [Superstition] was also the culmination of Baker's most distinguishing characteristics, as a playwright--namely, his concern with American subjects and problems."<ref name=":0" />

==1812-1819==
Barker served as a soldier in the War of 1812.<ref name="Bryer">Bryer, Jackson R. and Hartig, Mary C. Eds. ''The Facts on File Companion to American Drama'', Ann Arbor, Michigan: Sheridan Books, 2010. P. 55. Print</ref> He was appointed captain in the Second Regiment of Pennsylvania Artillery on May 26, 1812, by [[William Eustis]], Secretary of War.<ref name=Musser/> In 1814, he was severely wounded in a duel.<ref name=Simpson /> He was shot in both legs by Major [[Wade Hampton II|Wade Hampton]], father of the Confederate general, and he was incapacitated from active service for several years.<ref name=Musser/> He was appointed major<ref>Quinn, Arthur Hobson. ''A History of the American Drama: From the beginning to the Civil War''. New York: F. S. Crofts and Co., 1943. PP 136-137. Print.</ref> when he was made assistant adjutant general of the 4th Military District by President Madison on April 8, 1814. He was honorably discharged in June 1815.<ref name=Musser/> After discharge, he returned to Philadelphia, where he continued working in politics, as well as writing and supporting theater. Between 1815 and 1817, he wrote reviews for the [[Chestnut Street Theatre]] and he was a trustee of the Theatrical Fund for Indigent Actors.<ref name="Gates 1984, 121"/> Barker wrote his next drama, ''The Armourer's Escape; or, Three Years at Nootka Sound,'' in 1817. It was based on the real-life adventures of [[John Jewitt]], who played himself at the premiere. Though the playbill has survived, the two-act melodrama has not. It was premiered on March 21, 1817.<ref>Quinn 1943, 144-145</ref> His next piece, ''An oration delivered at Philadelphia Vauxhall Gardens, on the forty-first anniversary of American independence'', was published in 1817, printed by John Binns (Philadelphia). In spring 1817, Barker took his father's seat on the Philadelphia board of Aldermen.<ref name="Crowley"/> In 1819, Barker was elected Mayor of Philadelphia. As mayor, he was known for being fair, speaking out against slavery, raising funds for local charities and sending aid to Savannah after the city was hurt by a devastating fire.<ref name="Gates 1984, 121"/>

==Later life==
After his term as mayor had ended, he continued to write. ''Superstition; or, The Fanatic Father'' (1824), is a tragedy, produced at the Chestnut Street Theatre in 1824 with [[Mary Ann Duff]] as Mary. According to the historian [[Arthur Hobson Quinn]], the plot revolves around "Puritan refugee Goff, issuing from his solitude to lead the villagers to victory against the Indians. With this theme he interwove that of the intolerance of the New England Puritans and their persecution for witchcraft."<ref>Quinn 1943, 147</ref> [[File:Superstition Poster.jpg|thumb|''Superstition'' poster]] His play, ''How to Try a Lover'', was written in 1817, but was not produced until 1836 as ''The Court of Love''. It was premiered in Philadelphia on March 26, 1836, at the Arch Street Theatre.<ref name="Quinn 1943, 145">Quinn 1943, 145</ref> It is a dramatic adaptation of the French [[picaresque novel]], ''La folie espagnole'', by [[Pigault-Lebrun]] (1753–1835). Barker wrote, "It was the only drama I have written with which I was satisfied."<ref name="Quinn 1943, 145"/> However, Barker felt he could better serve society as a politician than a dramatist.<ref name="Crowley 1972, 365">Crowley 1972, 365</ref> He was unable to combine his political and literary roles, which led to him seeing himself as primarily a politician and an author second.<ref name="Crowley 1972, 365"/> He turned his focus from writing plays to writing political tracts, commemorative poems and local history between 1818 and 1858.<ref>Crowley, John W. "James Nelson Barker in Perspective", ''Educational Theater Journal'' '''24'''.4 1972 p. 366</ref> His non-fiction works include ''A Sketch of Primitive Settlements on Delaware River'' (1827) and contributions to the columns of many democratic journals during the Bank War and Panic, from 1832 to 1836 which were highly valued.<ref name=Simpson /> In addition to writing, from 1829 to 1838, Barker was the collector of the port of Philadelphia, and from 1841 to 1858, he was the assistant comptroller of the U.S. Treasury.<ref name="Bryer"/> He was involved in the presidential campaigns for both Jackson and Van Buren during the 1820s and 1830s.<ref name="Gates 1984, 121"/> He died in 1858 of pneumonia in Washington, D.C..<ref name="Gates 1984, 121"/>

==Legacy==
Barker's literary work advocated native dramas<ref>Miller, Tice L.</ref> and emphasized a growing desire among American writers to claim the nation's early history.<ref name="ReferenceB">Bryer, Jackson R. and Hartig, Mary C. Eds.</ref> His plays are set in America, which was unusual for that period,<ref name="ReferenceA"/> and he is considered to be among the first generation of American playwrights.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> He knew that his plays could shape national identity<ref name="Crowley, John W">Crowley, John W.</ref> by creating an independent American consciousness.<ref name="Crowley, John W"/> Quoted in the ''Philadelphia Democratic Press'', Barker believed that theatre had a higher goal, "to keep alive the spirit of freedom; and to unite conflicting parties in a common love of liberty and devotedness to country".<ref name="Crowley, John W"/>
