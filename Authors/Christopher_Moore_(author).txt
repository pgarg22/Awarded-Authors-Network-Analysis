'''Christopher Moore''' (born January 1, 1957)<ref name=isfdb/> is an American writer of  [[comic fantasy]]. He was born in [[Toledo, Ohio]].<ref name=isfdb/><ref name=cambria/> He grew up in [[Mansfield, Ohio]], and attended [[Ohio State University]] and [[Brooks Institute of Photography]] in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[California]].

An only child, Moore learned to amuse himself with his imagination.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bookseriesinorder.com/christopher-moore/|title=Christopher Moore - Book Series In Order|date=2015-07-11|work=Book Series in Order|access-date=2017-07-17|language=en-US}}</ref> He loved reading and his father brought him plenty of books from the library every week. He started writing around the age of twelve and realized that this was his talent by the time he was 16, and he began to consider making it his career.<ref name="Questions And Answers with Christopher Moore">[http://hortorian.com/2011/04/questions-and-answers-with-christopher-moore/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320180000/http://hortorian.com/2011/04/questions-and-answers-with-christopher-moore/ |date=March 20, 2012 }}</ref>

Moore's novels typically involve conflicted [[everyman]] characters struggling through supernatural or extraordinary circumstances.  With the possible exceptions of ''[[Fool (novel)|Fool]]'', ''The Serpent of Venice'', ''Sacré Bleu'', and ''Shakespeare for Squirrels: A Novel'', all his books take place in the same universe and some characters recur from novel to novel.

According to his interview in the June 2007 issue of ''Writer's Digest'', the film rights to Moore's first novel, ''[[Practical Demonkeeping]]'' (1992), were purchased by Disney even before the book had a publisher.  In answer to repeated questions from fans over the years, Moore stated that all of his books have been optioned or sold for films, but that as yet "none of them are in any danger of being made into a movie."<ref name="bordersinterview">[http://www.bordersmedia.com/store01/moore/default.asp]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207112920/http://www.bordersmedia.com/store01/moore/default.asp |date=February 7, 2012 }}</ref>

Moore has named [[Kurt Vonnegut]], [[Douglas Adams]], [[John Steinbeck]], [[Tom Robbins]], [[Richard Brautigan]], [[Robert Bloch]], [[Richard Matheson]], [[Jules Verne]], [[Ray Bradbury]], [[H. P. Lovecraft]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and [[Ian Fleming]] as key influences on his writing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chrismoore.com/interviews/popculturezoo-exclusive-interview-with-christopher-moore/|title=PopCultureZoo: Exclusive Interview With Christopher Moore – Christopher Moore|website=www.chrismoore.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chrismoore.com/faq/|title=Frequently Asked Questions – Christopher Moore|website=www.chrismoore.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chrismoore.com/interviews/satire-horror-and-humor-oh-my/|title=Satire, Horror, and Humor… Oh My! – Christopher Moore|website=www.chrismoore.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-05}}</ref>

==Bibliography==

=== Novels ===
Most of Moore's novels take place in the same fictional universe since characters from one book frequently turn up as minor characters or have cameos in other books. Some novels with a common protagonist or setting can be grouped into series; however, with the exception of the vampire books, they can all be read as stand-alone novels.
