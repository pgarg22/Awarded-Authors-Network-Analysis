== Life ==
Anne Bradby was educated at [[Downe House School]] and later published a biography of her headmistress, [[Olive Willis]]. After six months in [[Florence]] and [[Rome]], she took a diploma in journalism at [[King's College London]].

In 1938, she married [[Vivian Ridler]], the future Printer to [[Oxford University]] (1958–78), but then the manager of the Bunhill Press, [[London]], and they had two daughters and two sons.

She edited ''Charles Williams: The Image of the City and other Essays'' (1958) and ''Charles Williams: Selected Writings'' (1961). A Christian and friend and correspondent of [[C. S. Lewis]], she was on the edge of the [[Inklings]] group.  Also closely associated with T. S. Eliot, she wrote a short but powerful poem, "I Who am Here Dissembled", full of allusions to images in Eliot's own poems, for the [[anthology]] ''T. S. Eliot: A Symposium'' in honour of his sixtieth birthday.<ref>{{cite book|title=T. S. Eliot: A Symposium|last=Ridler|first=Anne|year=1948|publisher=Editions Poetry|location=London|editor=March, Richard and Tambimuttu|page=189|chapter=I Who am Here Dissembled}}</ref>

For a short time in the 1940s, Ridler was also a successful verse dramatist, writing such plays as ''Cain'' (1943) and ''Shadow Factory: A Nativity Play'' (1945).

[[Poetry (magazine)|''Poetry: A Magazine of Verse'']] awarded her in 1954 the Oscar Blumenthal Prize and in 1955 the Union League Civic and Arts Poetry Prize. In 1998 she was one of four poets who received the [[Cholmondeley Award]] from the [[Society of Authors]].<ref name="PersoonWatson2015">{{cite book|author1=James Persoon|author2=Robert R.
