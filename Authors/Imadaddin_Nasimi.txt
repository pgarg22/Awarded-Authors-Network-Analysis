According to the third edition of the ''[[Encyclopedia of Islam]]'' Nasimi "is considered to be the true founder" of Turkic classical ''ʿarūḍ'' poetry.<ref name="EI3"/>

==Name and titles==
The third edition of the ''[[Encyclopedia of Islam]]'' notes that according to some sources, including Sibṭ Ibn al-ʿAjamī (died 1415), Nasimi's given name was Ali.<ref name="EI3">{{EI3|last=Heß|first=Michael R.|title=Nǝsimi, İmadǝddin|year=2021|url=https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-3/nsimi-imadddin-COM_40738}}</ref> The name "Nasimi"{{efn|Spelled as "Nǝsimi" in the Latin Azerbaijani script.}} was the [[pen name]] (''makhlaṣ'') he most commonly used.<ref name="EI3"/> The ''Encyclopedia of Islam'' adds that although contested, the name Nasimi is "most convincingly explained" as a reflection of "Na'imi", the pen name of [[Fazlallah Astarabadi]] (died 1394).<ref name="EI3"/> Nasimi also used the pen name "Huseyni".<ref name="EI3"/> The epithet (''[[laqab]]'') "Imadaddin",{{efn|Spelled as "İmadǝddin" in the Latin Azerbaijani script.}} which translates as "the pillar of the religion", or the title "[[Sayyid]]" (marking his claim of descent from the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]) are often added in order to distinguish him from other figures who bore the name Nasimi.<ref name="EI3"/>

Most extant information about Nasimi's life is unconfirmed.<ref name="EI3"/> This includes his date of birth, which, without definite proof, is usually said to be 1369–70.<ref name="EI3"/> Nesîmî's birthplace is wrapped in mystery: some claim that he was born in a province called Nesîm — hence the pen name — located either near [[Aleppo]] in modern-day [[Syria]],<ref name="andrews211">{{cite book |last=Andrews |first=Walter G. |author2=Black, Najaat |author3=Kalpakli, Mehmet  |title=Ottoman Lyric Poetry: An Anthology |year=1997 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=0-292-70472-0 |pages=211–212 }}</ref> or near [[Baghdad]] in modern-day [[Iraq]],<ref name="devellioglu824">{{cite book |last=Devellioğlu |first=Ferit |title=Osmanlıca-Türkçe ansiklopedik lûgat: eski ve yeni harflerle |year=1993 |publisher= Aydın Kitabevi|location= Ankara|isbn=975-7519-02-2 |pages=823–824 }}</ref> but no such province has been found to exist.

According to the second edition of the ''Encyclopædia of Islam'', Nasimi was an early Ottoman poet and mystic, and was most probably of [[Turkoman (ethnonym)|Turkoman]] origin. He was well versed in both Turkic and Persian, but wrote some poems in Arabic as well.<ref name="babinger" />
[[File:Əzim Əzimzadə - Nəsiminin edamı.jpg|thumb|right|Death of Nesimi by [[Azim Azimzade]].]]

From his poetry, it's evident that Nesîmî was an adherent of the Ḥurūfī movement, which was founded by Nesîmî's teacher [[Fazlallah Astarabadi (Naimi)|Fażlullāh Astarābādī]] of Astarābād, who was condemned for heresy and executed in [[Alinja]] near [[Nakhchivan (city)|Nakhchivan]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Sur les Traces du Soufisme Turc: Recherches sur l'Islam Populaire en Anatolie |last=Mélikoff |first=Irène |year=1992 |publisher=Editions Isis |isbn=975-428-047-9 |pages=163–174 }}</ref> The center of Fażlullāh's influence was [[Baku]] and most of his followers came from [[Shirvan]] (present-day Republic of [[Azerbaijan]]),<ref name="turner">{{cite book |title=Islam: Critical Concepts in Sociology |last=Turner |first=Bryan S. |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-12347-X |page=284 }}</ref> then ruled by the [[Shirvanshahs]].

Nesîmî become one of the most influential advocates of the [[Ḥurūfī]] doctrine and the movement's ideas were spread to a large extent through his poetry. While Fażlullāh believed that he himself was the manifestation of God, for Nesîmî, at the center of Creation there was God, who bestowed His Light on man. Through sacrifice and self perfection, man can become one with God.<ref>{{cite book |title=Хуруфизм и его представители в Азербайджане |last=Kuli-zade |first=Zümrüd |year=1970 |publisher=Elm |location=Baku |pages=151–164 }}</ref> Around 1417, (or possibly 1404)<ref name="andrews211" /><ref name="cengiz149">{{cite book |title=Divan şiiri antolojisi |last=Cengiz |first=Halil Erdoğan |author-link= |year=1972 |publisher=Milliyet Yayın Ltd.

A number of legends later grew up around Nesimi's execution, such as the story that he mocked his executioners with improvised verse and, after the execution, draped his flayed skin around his shoulders and departed.<ref name="andrews211" /> A rare historical account of the event — the ''Tarih-i Heleb'' of Akhmad ibn Ibrahim al-Halabi — relates that the court, which was of the [[Maliki]] school of religious law, was unwilling to convict Nesîmî of [[apostasy]], and that the order of execution instead came from the secular power of the [[emir]] of Aleppo, who was hoping to avoid open rebellion.<ref name="safarli">{{cite book |title=Imadəddin Nəsimi, Seçilmis Əsərləri |last=Safarli |first=Aliyar |year=1985 |publisher=Maarif Publishing House |location=Baku |pages=1–7}}</ref>

Nesîmî's tomb in Aleppo remains an important place of pilgrimage to this day.

==Poetry==

Nesîmî's collected poems, or ''[[Diwan (poetry)|dîvân]]'', number about 300, and include ''[[ghazal]]''s, ''[[qasida]]''s ("lyrics"), and ''[[Ruba'i|rubâ'î]]''s ("quatrains") in [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani Turkic]],<ref name="baldick">{{cite book |last=Baldick |first=Julian |title=Mystical Islam: An Introduction to Sufism |year=2000 |publisher=I.

His Turkic divan, considered his most important work, contains 250–300 [[ghazal]]s and more than 150 [[Ruba'i|rubâ'îs]]. A large body of [[Bektashi]] and [[Alevi]] poetry is also attributed to Nesîmî, largely as a result of Hurûfî ideas' influence upon those two groups.

One of Nesîmî's most famous poems is the ''gazel'' beginning with the following lines:

:منده صغار ايكى جهان من بو جهانه صغمازام
:گوهر لامکان منم كون و مکانه صغمازام

:''Məndə sığar iki cahan, mən bu cahâna sığmazam''
:''Gövhər-i lâ-məkân mənəm, kövn ü məkâna sığmazam''<ref name="tcref">{{cite web|url=http://www.kultur.gov.tr/TR/dosyagoster.aspx?DIL=1&BELGEANAH=109862&DOSYAISIM=imadeddinnesimi.pdf|title=İmadeddin Nesimi|last=Safarli|first=Aliyar G.|author2=Yusifli, Khalil|year=2005|work=Azerbaycan Eski Türk Edebiyatı|publisher=Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Turkey|language=tr|access-date=2008-01-08}}</ref>
:Both worlds can fit within me, but in this world I cannot fit
:I am the placeless essence, but into existence I cannot fit
:Both worlds fit into me I do not fit into both worlds (This world and the hereafter)
:I am a placeless gem (essence) I don’t fit into the place
:Throne and terrain, B and E all was understood in me (God said "be" and the universe was begun)
:End your words be silent I don’t fit into Descriptions and Expressions
:The universe is my sine; the starting point of me goes to the essence
:You know with this sign, that I don’t fit into the sign
:With suspicion and  impression, no one can grasp the truth
:The one who knows the truth knows that I do not fit into suspicion and  impression
:Look at the form and the concept, Know inside the form that
:I’m composed of body and soul but I don’t fit into body and soul

The poem is an example of Nesîmî's poetic brand of [[Hurufism]] in its [[Mysticism|mystical]] form. There is a contrast made between the physical and the spiritual worlds, which are seen to be ultimately united in the human being. As such, the human being is seen to partake of the same spiritual essence as [[Allah|God]]: the phrase ''lâ-mekân'' (لامکان), or "the placeless", in the second line is a Sufi term used for God.<ref>The phrase is in some ways redolent of the earlier Sufi [[Mansur Al-Hallaj|Mansur al-Hallaj's]] statement "''ana al-Haqq''" (أنا الحق), which means literally "I am the Truth" but also — because ''al-Haqq'' is one of the [[99 Names of God|99 names of God]] in Islamic tradition — "I am God".</ref> The same term, however, can be taken literally as meaning "without a place", and so Nesîmî is also using the term to refer to human physicality.<ref>This device of employing double, and even completely opposite, meanings for the same word is known as ''[[Pun|tevriyye]]'' (توريه).</ref> In his poem, Nesîmî stresses that understanding God is ultimately not possible in this world, though it is nonetheless the duty of human beings to strive for such an understanding. Moreover, as the poem's constant play with the ideas of the physical and the spiritual underlines, Nesîmî calls for this search for understanding to be carried out by people within their own selves. This couplet has been described in different pictures, movies, poems, and other pieces of arts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZLqHdwDvjg |title=ChingizArt: Colors dedicated to Nesimi |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2010-01-18 |access-date=2013-05-20}}</ref>

Some of Nesîmî's work is also more specifically Hurûfî in nature, as can be seen in the following [[quatrain]] from a long poem:

:''Gördüm ol ayı vü bayram eyledim''
:''Şol meye bu gözleri câm eyledim''

:''Hecce vardım ezm-i ehrâm eyledim''
:''Fâ vü zâd-ı lâm-i Heqq nâm eyledim''<ref name="tcref" />

:Seeing that moon I rejoiced
:I made of my eyes a cup for its wine
:I went on [[Hajj]] in pilgrim's garb
:I called [[Pe (Semitic letter)|Fâ]], [[Ḍād|Zâd]], and [[Lamedh|Lâm]] by the name "Truth"

In the quatrain's last line, "Fâ", "Zâd", and "Lâm" are the names of the Arabic letters that together spell out the first name of the founder of Hurufism, Fazl-ullah. As such, Nesîmî is praising his ''[[Sheikh#The Shaykh of Sufism|shaykh]]'', or spiritual teacher, and in fact comparing him to God, who is also given the name "Truth" (''al-Haqq''). Moreover, using the Perso-Arabic letters in the poem in such a manner is a direct manifestation of Hurûfî beliefs insofar as the group expounds a vast and complex letter [[symbol]]ism in which each letter represents an aspect of the human character, and all the letters together can be seen to represent God.

Nesîmî is also considered a superb love poet, and his poems express the idea of love on both the personal and the spiritual plane. Many of his ''gazel''s, for instance, have a high level of emotiveness, as well as expressing a great mastery of language:

:اوزكى مندن نهان ايتمك ديلرسه ڭ ايتمه غل
:گوزلرم ياشڭ روان ايتمك ديلرسه ڭ ايتمه غل

:برك نسرین اوزره مسکين زلفكى سن طاغدوب
:عاشقى بى خانمان ايتمك ديلرسه ڭ ايتمه غل

:''Üzünü menden nihân etmek dilersen, etmegil''
:''Gözlerim yaşın revân etmek dilersen, etmegil''

:''Berq-i nesrin üzre miskin zülfünü sen dağıdıb''
:''Âşiqi bîxânimân etmek dilersen, etmegil''<ref name="tcref" />

:Should you want to veil your face from me, oh please do not!
:Should you want to make my tears flow, oh please do not!

:Should you want to lay your hair of musk atop the rose
:And leave your lover destitute, oh please do not!

==Legacy==
[[Image:Nesimi Film.jpg|250px|thumb|"[[Nesimi (film)|Nesimi]]" film by [[Azerbaijanfilm]] studio in 1973 was dedicated to the 600th anniversary of the poet's birth]]
Nesîmî's work represents an important stage in the development of poetry not only in the Azerbaijani language vernacular, but also in the [[Turkish literature#Divan poetry|Ottoman Divan poetry]] tradition. After his death, Nesîmî's work continued to influence many [[Turkic language]] poets and authors such as [[Fuzûlî]] (1483?–1556), [[Khata'i]] (1487–1524), and [[Pir Sultan Abdal]] (1480–1550).

Nesîmî is venerated in the modern [[Azerbaijan|Republic of Azerbaijan]], and one of the districts of the capital city, [[Baku]], bears his name. There is also a monument to him in the city, sculpted by T. Mamedov and I. Zeynalov in 1979.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.azerbaijans.com/content_330_en.html|title=Sculptures|website=www.azerbaijans.com|language=az|access-date=2018-11-26}}</ref> Furthermore, the Institute of Linguistics at the Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan is named after him, and there was also a 1973 Azerbaijani film, ''Nasimi'' (the Azerbaijani language spelling of his name), made about him.
