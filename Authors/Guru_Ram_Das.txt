==Biography==
[[File: Gurudwara Arjun Ram 4 (WCLA).jpg|thumb|The [[Gurdwara Janam Asthan Guru Ram Das]] in [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]], commemorates the birthplace of the Guru.]]
Guru Ram Das was born on 24 September 1534 in a Sodhi Khatri family in Chuna Mandi, Lahore.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Singh|first=Prithi Pal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EhGkVkhUuqoC&pg=PA54|title=The History of Sikh Gurus|date=2007|publisher=Lotus Press|isbn=978-81-8382-075-2|pages=54|language=en}}</ref> His father was Hari Das and mother Daya Kaur, both of whom died when he was aged seven. He was brought up by his grandmother.<ref name=eosramdas/><ref name=":0" /> He married Bibi Bhani, the younger daughter of Amar Das. They had three sons: Prithi Chand, Mahadev and [[Guru Arjan]].<ref name="Mandair2013p38"/>

===Early life ===
Before becoming Guru, Ram Das represented [[Guru Amar Das]] in the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] court. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Singh|first=Kushwant|title=A history of the Sikhs Volume-1|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-567308-1|pages=52}}</ref>

===Death and succession===
Guru Ram Das died on 1 September 1581, in [[Goindval]] town of [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]].<ref>{{cite book |author=J. S. Grewal |title=The Khalsa: Sikh and Non-Sikh Perspectives |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SonXAAAAMAAJ |year=2004 |publisher=Manohar |isbn=978-81-7304-580-6 |page=207 |quote=Guru Ram Das died in Goindval on 1 September 1581 to be succeeded by his youngest son.  }}</ref>

Of his three sons, Ram Das chose Arjan, the youngest, to succeed him as the fifth Sikh Guru. The choice of successor led to disputes and internal divisions among the Sikhs.<ref name="ShackleMandair2013xv"/> The elder son of Ram Das named Prithi Chand is remembered in the Sikh tradition as vehemently opposing Arjan, creating a faction Sikh community which the Sikhs following Arjan called as ''Minas'' (literally, "scoundrels"), and is alleged to have attempted to assassinate young [[Guru Hargobind|Hargobind]].<ref name=fenech39>{{cite book|author1=Louis E. Fenech|author2=W. H. McLeod|title=Historical Dictionary of Sikhism|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=xajcAwAAQBAJ |year=2014| publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers|isbn=978-1-4422-3601-1|page=39}}</ref><ref name="McLeod2009p20">{{cite book|author=W.

The competing texts do acknowledge disagreement and describe Prithi Chand as having become the ''Sahib Guru'' after the martyrdom of Guru Arjan Dev and disputing the succession of [[Guru Hargobind]], the grandson of Ram Das.<ref>{{cite book|author1= Pashaura Singh|author2= Louis E.

==Influence==
===Amritsar===
Guru Ram Das is credited with founding the holy city of Amritsar in the Sikh tradition.<ref name="McLeod1990p28"/><ref name="ShackleMandair2013xv"/> Two versions of stories exist regarding the land where Ram Das settled. In one based on a Gazetteer record, the land was purchased with Sikh donations, for 700 rupees from the owners of the village of [[Tung, Sikkim|Tung]].<ref name=eosramdas/><ref>{{cite book|author1=Louis E. Fenech|author2=W. H. McLeod|title=Historical Dictionary of Sikhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xajcAwAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers|isbn=978-1-4422-3601-1|page=67}}</ref>

According to the Sikh historical records, the site was chosen by [[Guru Amar Das]] and called Guru Da Chakk, after he had asked Ram Das to find land to start a new town with a man made pool as its central point.<ref name=eosramdas/><ref name="Arshi1989p5">{{cite book|author=Pardeep Singh Arshi|title=The Golden Temple: history, art, and architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rcmfAAAAMAAJ|year=1989|publisher=Harman|isbn=978-81-85151-25-0|pages=5–7}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=Louis E. Fenech|author2=W. H. McLeod|title=Historical Dictionary of Sikhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xajcAwAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers|isbn=978-1-4422-3601-1|page=33}}</ref> After his coronation in 1574, and the hostile opposition he faced from the sons of Amar Das,<ref name="Mandair2013p38"/> Ram Das founded the town named after him as "Ramdaspur". He started by completing the pool, and building his new official Guru centre and home next to it. He invited merchants and artisans from other parts of India to settle into the new town with him.<ref name=eosramdas/> The town expanded during the time of Arjan financed by donations and constructed by voluntary work. The town grew to become the city of Amritsar, and the pool area grew into a temple complex after his son built the [[gurdwara]] [[Harmandir Sahib]], and installed the scripture of Sikhism inside the new temple in 1604.<ref name="ShackleMandair2013xv"/>

The construction activity between 1574 and 1604 is described in ''Mahima Prakash Vartak'', a semi-historical Sikh [[hagiography]] text likely composed in 1741, and the earliest known document dealing with the lives of all the ten Gurus.<ref>{{cite book|author=W.H. McLeod|title=Textual Sources for the Study of Sikhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7xIT7OMSJ44C&pg=PA28  |year=1990|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-56085-4|pages=28–29}}</ref>

===Scripture hymns===
Ram Das composed 638 hymns, or about ten percent of hymns in the [[Guru Granth Sahib]]. He was a celebrated [[poet]], and composed his work in 30 ancient ''[[raga]]s'' of [[Indian classical music]].<ref name=pashaura399>{{cite book|author1=Pashaura Singh|author2=Louis E. Fenech|title=The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8I0NAwAAQBAJ |date=March 2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-969930-8|pages=399–400}}</ref>

These cover a range of topics:

{{Quote|One who calls himself to be a disciple of the Guru should rise before dawn and meditate on the Lord's Name. During the early hours, he should rise and bathe, cleansing his soul in a tank of nectar [water], while he repeats the Name the Guru has spoken to him. By this procedure he truly washes away the sins of his soul. – GGS 305 (partial)<br><br>The Name of God fills my heart with joy. My great fortune is to meditate on God's name. The miracle of God's name is attained through the perfect Guru, but only a rare soul walks in the light of the Guru's wisdom. – GGS 94 (partial)<br><br>O man! The poison of pride is killing you, blinding you to God. Your body, the colour of gold, has been scarred and discoloured by selfishness. Illusions of grandeur turn black, but the ego-maniac is attached to them. – GGS 776 (partial)|Guru Granth Sahib|Translated by G. S. Mansukhani<ref name=eosramdas/>}}

His compositions continue to be sung daily in Harimandir Sahib ([[Golden temple]]) of Sikhism.<ref name=pashaura399/>

===Wedding hymn===
[[File:Sikh wedding.jpg|thumb|The ''laavan'' verses of Ram Das are recited with clockwise circumambulation in a Sikh wedding.]]
Ram Das, along with Amar Das, are credited with various parts of the ''Anand'' and ''Laavan'' composition in ''Suhi'' mode. It is a part of the ritual of four clockwise circumambulation of the Sikh scripture by the bride and groom to solemnize the marriage in Sikh tradition.<ref name=pashaura399/><ref name=fenech34>{{cite book|author1=Louis E. Fenech|author2=W. H. McLeod|title=Historical Dictionary of Sikhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xajcAwAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers|isbn=978-1-4422-3601-1|pages=33–34}}</ref> This was intermittently used, and its use lapsed in late 18th century. However, sometime in 19th or 20th century by conflicting accounts, the composition of Ram Das came back in use along with Anand Karaj ceremony, replacing the Hindu ritual of circumambulation around the fire. The composition of Ram Das emerged to be one of the basis of British colonial era Anand Marriage Act of 1909.<ref name=fenech34/>

The wedding hymn was composed by Ram Das for his own daughter's wedding. The first stanza of the Laavan hymn by Ram Das refers to the duties of the householder's life to accept the Guru's word as guide, remember the Divine Name. The second verse and circle reminds the singular One is encountered everywhere and in the depths of the self. The third speaks of the Divine Love. The fourth reminds that the union of the two is the union of the individual with the Infinite.<ref>{{cite book|author=Nikky-Guninder Kaur Singh|title=Sikhism: An Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e0ZmAXw7ok8C |year=2011|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-84885-321-8|page=26}}</ref>

===Masand system===
While [[Guru Amar Das]] introduced the ''manji'' system of religious organization, Ram Das extended it with adding the ''masand'' institution. The ''masand'' were Sikh community leaders who lived far from the Guru, but acted to lead the distant congregations, their mutual interactions and collect revenue for Sikh activities and temple building.<ref name="Mandair2013p38"/><ref name="Fenech2014p44">{{cite book|author1=Pashaura Singh|author2=Louis E.
