'''Wilbur Addison Smith''' (9 January 1933 – 13 November 2021) was a Zambian-born British-South African novelist specialising in historical fiction about international involvement in [[Southern Africa]] across four centuries, seen from the viewpoints of both black and white families.

An accountant by training, he gained a film contract with his first published novel ''[[When the Lion Feeds]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |date= 2 October 2016 |title= Wilbur Smith Books In Publication & Chronological Order |url= https://www.bookseries.org/authors/wilbur-smith/ |access-date= 1 September 2020 |website= Book Series |language= en-US}}</ref> This encouraged him to become a full-time writer, and he developed three long chronicles of the South African experience which all became [[best-seller]]s. He acknowledged his publisher Charles Pick's advice to "write about what you know best",<ref>{{Cite web |last= Dismore |first= Richard |date=15 June 2018 |title= Life inspired by a love of Africa|url=https://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/books/974596/wilbur-smith-book-review-on-leopard-rock-a-life-of-adventures|access-date=1 September 2020|website=Express.co.uk|language=en}}</ref> and his work takes in much authentic detail of the local hunting and mining way of life, along with the romance and conflict that goes with it. 

By the time of his death in 2021 he had published 49 books and had sold more than 140 million copies,<ref name=GuardianOB>{{Cite news |author= Agence France-Presse |date= 14 November 2021 |title= The Guardian |work=Bestselling author Wilbur Smith dies aged 88 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/nov/14/bestselling-author-wilbur-smith-dies-aged-88}}</ref> 24 million of them in Italy (by 2014).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.wilbursmith.it/index.php |title= Wilbur Smith -|access-date= 5 May 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150426040112/http://www.wilbursmith.it/index.php|archive-date= 26 April 2015|url-status=dead }}</ref>

== Early life==
Smith was born in [[Ndola]], [[Northern Rhodesia]], (now [[Zambia]]), as was his younger sister Adrienne,<ref name=Smith/> to Elfreda (née Lawrence, 1913 – ) and Herbert James Smith. He was named after aviator [[Wright brothers| Wilbur Wright]].<ref name=Smith/>
 
His father Herbert was a [[metal worker]] who opened a sheet metal factory and then created a {{convert|25,000|acre|ha|abbr=on|adj=on}} cattle ranch on the banks of the Kafue River near Mazabuka, by buying up a number of separate farms.<ref name=Smith/> "My father was a tough man", said Smith. "He was used to working with his hands and had massively developed arms from cutting metal. He was a boxer, a hunter, very much a man's man. I don't think he ever read a book in his life, including mine".<ref name="age"/>

As a baby, Smith was sick with cerebral [[malaria]] for ten days but made a full recovery.<ref name="early">{{cite web |url= http://www.wilbursmithbooks.com/index.php/meet-wilbur/biography/early-days |title= Early Days |website=  Wilbur Smith Books| access-date= 14 March 2013}}</ref> Together with his younger sister he spent the first years of his life on his parents' cattle ranch, comprising {{Convert|12000|ha}} of forest, hills and [[savanna]]. On the ranch his companions were the sons of the ranch workers, small black boys with the same interests and preoccupations as Smith. With his companions he ranged through the bush, hiking, hunting, and trapping birds and small mammals. His mother loved books, read to him every night and later gave him novels of escape and excitement, which piqued his interest in fiction; however, his father dissuaded him from pursuing writing.<ref name=Smith/>

===Education===
Smith attended boarding school at [[Cordwalles Preparatory School]] in [[Natal (province)|Natal]] (now [[KwaZulu-Natal]]).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Dymocks – Wilbur Smith – author |url=https://www.dymocks.com.au/authors/wilbur-smith |access-date=3 September 2020 |website=www.dymocks.com.au}}</ref> While in Natal, he continued to be an avid reader and had the good fortune to have an English master who made him his ''protégé'' and would discuss the books Smith had read that week. Unlike Smith's father and many others, the English master made it clear to Smith that being a bookworm was praiseworthy, rather than something to be ashamed of, and let Smith know that his writings showed great promise. He tutored Smith on how to achieve dramatic effects, to develop characters, and to keep a story moving forward.{{Citation needed|date=November 2021}}

For high school Smith attended [[Michaelhouse]], a boarding school situated in the [[KwaZulu-Natal Midlands]].<ref name=Michaelhouse>{{cite web |url= http://www.michaelhouse.org/home.aspx |website= Michaelhouse.org |title= Home page |access-date= 8 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110509083249/http://www.michaelhouse.org/home.aspx |archive-date=9 May 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> He felt that he never "fitted in" with the people, goals and interests of the other students at Michaelhouse, but he did start a school newspaper for which he wrote the entire content, except for the sports pages. His weekly satirical column became mildly famous and was circulated as far afield as [[The Wykeham Collegiate]] and [[St. Anne's Diocesan College|St Anne's]].<ref name="school">{{cite web |url= http://www.wilbursmithbooks.com/index.php/meet-wilbur/biography/school-days |title=School Days, Wilbur Smith Biography |website= Wilbur Smith Books |access-date= 14 March 2013}}</ref>

===Accountant===
Smith wanted to become a journalist, writing about social conditions in South Africa, but his father's advice to "get a real job" prompted him to become a tax accountant ([[Chartered accountant#South Africa|chartered accountant]]).<ref>{{Cite web |title= 10 Things You Didn’t Know About Wilbur Smith {{!}} Youth Village Zambia |url= https://youthvillagezm.com/2019/07/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-wilbur-smith-2/ |access-date= 6 September 2020 |language= en-GB}}</ref>

"My father was a colonialist and I followed what he said until I was in my 20s and learned to think for myself", he said. "I didn't want to perpetuate injustices so I left [[Rhodesia]] in the time of [[Ian Smith]]."<ref name=Cecil/>

He attended [[Rhodes University]] in [[Grahamstown]], [[Eastern Cape]], South Africa and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Commerce]] in 1954. During the university holidays he worked in the gold mines and over the 1953–54 break with his friend Hillary Currey on a fishing boat based out of Walvis Bay and whalers.<ref name=Smith/> The next year believing he was tough enough after having worked on a fishing boat he took a Christmas vacation job on a whaling factory ship. He lasted four weeks.<ref name=Smith/> Following graduation, he joined the [[Goodyear Tire]]s and Rubber Co in Port Elizabeth, where he worked until 1958. After selling their ranch his parents had retired to Kloof near Durban in South Africa. Unfortunately some bad investments forced Smith’s father to return to work. In partnership with his son he established in Salisbury the sheet metal manufacturing business of H. J. Smith and Son Ltd.<ref name=Smith/><ref name=BSIO>{{cite web |title= Wilbur Smith Books in Order |publisher= Book Series in order |url=  https://www.bookseriesinorder.com/wilbur-smith/ |accessdate= 12 October 2021}}</ref> However the business ran into financial difficulties forcing Smith, who was by now 25 and divorced to take a job in 1963 as a tax assessor at the [[Inland Revenue]] Service in Salisbury.<ref name=Smith/><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.wilbursmithbooks.com/index.php/meet-wilbur/biography/university-days |title=University Daya |website= Wilbur Smith Books |access-date=  14 March 2013}}</ref>

==Novelist==
===First novels===
With plenty of spare time in the evening and access to plenty of pens and paper through his job at the [[Inland Revenue]] Service, Smith turned back to his love of writing.<ref name=Smith/> He found that he was able to sell his first story "On Flinder’s Face" under the pen name Steven Lawrence to ''[[Argosy (magazine)|Argosy]]'' magazine in April 1963 for £70,<ref>{{Cite web |title= The first story I ever sold was to 'Argosy' magazine, which... at QuoteTab |url= https://www.quotetab.com/quote/by-wilbur-smith/the-first-story-i-ever-sold-was-to-argosy-magazine-which-no-longer-exists-tha|access-date=17 September 2020|website= QuoteTab|language=en}}</ref> twice his monthly salary. After a number of further acceptances, he wrote his first novel, ''The Gods First Make Mad'',<ref>{{Cite web |title= Dymocks – Wilbur Smith – author |url= https://www.dymocks.com.au/authors/wilbur-smith#:~:text=His%20first%20novel,%20The%20Gods,novel,%20When%20the%20Lion%20Feeds.|access-date=17 September 2020|website= www.dymocks.com.au}}</ref> and had by 1962 received 20 rejections. Reviewing what he had written Smith could see that he had at 180,000 words it was long, badly written, had too many characters and had tried to express an opinion on everything from politics and racial tension to women.<ref name=Smith/> 
  
Dejected he returned to work as an accountant, until when he was 27 years old he received a telegram from Ursula Williams, his agent in London enquiring as to progress on his new novel.<ref name=Smith/> Encouraged by her expectation that he would be writing another novel the urge to write once again overwhelmed him. He commenced work on another novel:
<blockquote>I wrote about my own father and my darling mother. I wove into the story chunks of early African history. I wrote about black people and white. I wrote about hunting and gold mining and carousing and women. I wrote about love and loving and hating. In short I wrote about all the things I knew well and loved better. I left out all the immature philosophies and radical politics and rebellious posturing that had been the backbone of the first novel. I even came up with a catching title, ''[[When the Lion Feeds]]''.<ref name="good">{{cite web |title= Good Days| website= Wilbur Smith Books |url= http://www.wilbursmithbooks.com/index.php/meet-wilbur/biography/good-days |access-date= 14 March 2013}}</ref></blockquote>
''When the Lion Feeds'' tells the stories of two young men, twins Sean and Garrick Courtney. The characters' surname was a tribute to Smith's grandfather, Courtney Smith, who had been a transport rider during the Witwatersrand gold rush in the late 1880s, had commanded a [[Maxim gun]] team during the [[Anglo-Zulu War|Zulu Wars]]. He had also hunted elephant both as sport and to provide meat for his family.<ref name=Smith/> Courtney Smith had a magnificent [[moustache]] and could tell wonderful stories that had helped inspire his grandson.{{Citation needed|date=November 2021}}

After reading the manuscript Smith's agent in London, Ursula Winant, rang Charles Pick the deputy managing director of [[Heinemann (publisher)|William Heinemann]] and convinced him to look at the novel. She also asked for an advance of £500 and a guaranteed initial print run of 5,000 copies, and that it was to be published before Christmas. After being impressed after reading the first chapter of the novel over the weekend Pick gave it to the company’s sales director Tim Manderson, who agreed that it should be published. Pick rang Winant and offered an advance of £1,000, with an initial print run of 10,000 copies.<ref name=Smith/> By the publication date Heinemanns had increased the print run to 20,000.{{Citation needed|date=November 2021}}

The book went on to be successful, selling around the world (except in South Africa, where it was banned) and enabling Smith to leave his job and write full-time.<ref name="good"/> Charles Pick later became Smith's mentor and agent.<ref name=Busy>{{cite web |url=http://www.wilbursmithbooks.com/index.php/meet-wilbur/biography/busy-days |title= Busy Days |website= Wilbur Smith Books |access-date= 14 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last= Hopper |first= Hedda |title= Africa is Poiter's Choice |work= The News and Courier |date= 30 August 1965 |page=3| url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2506&dat=19650830&id=Y-NQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UgsNAAAAIBAJ&pg=834,5905108 |access-date= 24 April 2012}}</ref> Smith says Pick gave him advice he never forgot: "Write for yourself, and write about what you know best." Pick also advised: "Don't talk about your books with anybody, even me, until they are written." Smith has said that, "Until it is written a book is merely smoke on the wind. It can be blown away by a careless word."<ref>{{cite web |title= Meet Wilbur Biography: Busy Days |website= wilbursmithbooks |url=  http://www.wilbursmithbooks.com/index.php/meet-wilbur/biography/busy-days}}</ref>

In 2012, Smith said ''When the Lion Feeds'' remained his favourite because it was his first to be published.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://thetossedsalad.com/2012/01/interview-wilbur-smith-favourite-when-lions-feed/ |title= Wilbur Smith: My Favourite Work is My First Book| website=The Tossed Salad |date= 31 January 2012 |access-date=22 March 2013}}</ref> Film rights were bought by [[Stanley Baker]] but no movie resulted. However, the money enabled Smith to quit his job in the South African taxation office, calculating he had enough to not have to work for two years.{{citation needed|date=November 2021}}

"I hired a caravan, parked it in the mountains, and wrote the second book", he said. "I knew it was sort of a watershed. I was 30 years of age, single again, and I could take the chance."<ref>{{cite news |last= Field |first= Michelle |title= A golden life crafted from a troubled land |newspaper= [[The Canberra Times]] |date= 13 May 1995 |page= 51 |url= http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article130550241 |access-date=25 January 2015 |via= National Library of Australia}}</ref>
Smith's second published novel was ''The [[Dark of the Sun]]'' (1965), a tale about mercenaries during the [[Congo Crisis]]. Film rights were sold to [[George Englund]] and [[MGM]] and it was filmed in 1968 starring [[Rod Taylor]].<ref>{{Cite web |last= Webmaster |title=Dark of the Sun/The Mercenaries (1967) {{!}} Nostalgia Central |url= https://nostalgiacentral.com/movies/movies-by-decade/movies-1960s/dark-of-the-sunthe-mercenaries-1967/ |access-date=12 October 2020 |language= en-US}}</ref>

Smith did not originally envision the Courtney family from ''When the Lion Feeds'' would become a series, but he returned to them for ''[[The Sound of Thunder]]'' (1966), taking the lead characters up to after the [[Second Boer War]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.reocities.com/sriramna/Wilbur_Smith_Interview.html |title=Interview with Wilbur Smith |date= 1989 |access-date= 21 March 2013}}</ref> At the time he was writing ''The Sound of Thunder'' in a caravan in the Inyanga mountains in November 1965 [[Ian Smith]] unilaterally declared [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence| Rhodesian independence]]. The resulting political violence forced Smith to return to the relative safety of Salisbury where he continued working on the novel during the day, while serving at night as a member of the reserve of the Rhodesian Police.<ref name=Smith/> "I would get called out and have to get bodies of children from pit lavatories after they had been killed with pangas (''[[machete]]s'')", he recalled.<ref name=Cecil/> As Smith didn’t share Ian Smith's views he moved with his now pregnant second wife to Onrus River near Hermanus in South Africa.<ref name=Smith/>   

''Shout at the Devil'' (1968) was a World War I adventure tale which would be filmed in 1976. It was followed by ''[[Gold (1974 film)|Gold Mine]]'' (1970), an adventure tale about the gold mining industry set in contemporary South Africa, based on a real-life flooding of a gold mine near Johannesburg in 1968.<ref>{{cite news |title= Gold |newspaper= [[The Australian Women's Weekly]] |date= 23 October 1974 |page=33 |url= http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51385617 |access-date=25 January 2015 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

''[[The Diamond Hunters]]'' (1971) was set in contemporary West Africa, later filmed as ''[[The Kingfisher Caper]]'' (1975). Around this time, Smith also wrote an original screenplay, ''[[The Last Lion]]'' (1971) which was filmed in South Africa with [[Jack Hawkins]]; it was not a success.{{Citation needed|date=November 2021}}

===''The Sunbird''===
Smith admits to being tempted by movie money at this stage of his career but deliberately wrote something that was a complete change of pace, ''[[The Sunbird]]'' (1972).<ref>{{Cite web |title= Wilbur Smith First Wife |url= https://www.republicadominicanaoaci.com/journal/1a016a-wilbur-smith-first-wife |access-date= 29 October 2020 |website= www.republicadominicanaoaci.com}}</ref> 
<blockquote>It was a very important book for me in my development as a writer because at that stage I was starting to become enchanted by the lure of Hollywood. There had been some movies made of my books and I thought "whoa, what a way to go… All that money!" and I thought "hold on—am I a scriptwriter or am I a real writer?" Writing a book that could never be filmed was my declaration of independence. I made it so diffuse, with different ages and brought characters back as different entities. It was a complex book, it gave me a great deal of pleasure but that was the inspiration—to break free.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/arts_and_culture/7982397.stm "Wilbur Smith answers your questions", ''BBC News'', 6 April 2009] accessed 14 March 2013</ref></blockquote>
''[[Eagle in the Sky]]'' (1974) was more typical fare, as was ''[[The Eye of the Tiger (novel)|The Eye of the Tiger]]'' (1975). Film rights for both were bought by [[Michael Klinger]] who was unable to turn them into movies; however, Klinger did produce films of ''Gold'' (1974) and ''[[Shout at the Devil (film)|Shout at the Devil]]'' (1976).{{Citation needed|date=November 2021}}

''[[Cry Wolf (novel)|Cry Wolf]]'' (1976) was a return to historical novels, set during the Italian invasion of Ethiopia in 1935. He then returned to the Courtney family of his first novel with ''[[A Sparrow Falls]]'' (1977), set during and after World War I. ''[[Hungry as the Sea]]'' (1978) and ''[[Wild Justice (novel)|Wild Justice]]'' (1979) were contemporary stories—the latter was his first best seller in the USA.<ref>{{cite news |last= McDowell |first=Edwin |title= Behind the Best Sellers: Wilbur Smith |work= The New York Times |date= 20 April 1980 |page= BR10}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last= Kleinfield |first= N.R. |title= The Sellers of Book Rights: A Big-Money World: Subsidiary Rights |work= The New York Times |date=15 June 1980 |page=F1}}</ref>

===Move to Pan Macmillan===
He embarked on a new series of historical novels, centering around the fictitious Ballantyne family, who helped colonise Rhodesia: ''[[A Falcon Flies]]'' (1980), ''[[Men of Men]]'' (1981), ''[[The Angels Weep]]'' (1982) and ''[[The Leopard Hunts in Darkness]]'' (1984).
''[[The Burning Shore]]'' (1985) saw him return to the Courtney family, from World War I onwards. He called this a "breakthrough" book for him "because the female lead kicked the arse of all the males in the book."<ref>{{Cite news|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/authorinterviews/11085608/Wilbur-Smith-interview-for-Desert-God-My-life-is-as-good-as-its-ever-been.html |title= Wilbur Smith interview for Desert God: 'My life is as good as it's ever been' |journal= Daily Telegraph |last= Kerridge |first= Jake |date=14 September 2014 |access-date= 11 January 2018 |language= en-GB |issn= 0307-1235}}</ref> 
Following the publication of ''The Burning Shore'' Charles Pick retired from Heinemann in 1985. As Smith did not want to lose Pick’s input and needed someone to oversee his contract and develop his readership, he asked him to become his literary agent. Pick agreed, setting up  in business as Charles Pick Consultancy. Pick was able to secure a better contract for Smith, which involved Smith moving to [[Pan Macmillan]], who had previously only been his paperback publisher.<ref name= Smith/>   

Smith stayed with the Courtney family for ''[[Power of the Sword]]'' (1986) (up to World War II), ''[[Rage (Smith novel)|Rage]]'' (1987) (the post-war period up until the [[Sharpeville massacre]]), ''[[A Time to Die (Smith novel)|A Time to Die]]'' (1989) (the war in Mozambique) and ''[[Golden Fox (novel)|Golden Fox]]'' (1990) (the Angola War).{{Citation needed|date=November 2021}}

''[[Elephant Song (Smith novel)|Elephant Song]]'' (1991) was a more contemporary tale, but then he kicked off a new cycle of novels set in Ancient Egypt: ''[[River God]]'' (1993) and ''[[The Seventh Scroll]]'' (1995). He returned to the Courtneys for ''[[Birds of Prey (Smith novel)|Birds of Prey]]'' (1997) and ''[[Monsoon (novel)|Monsoon]]'' (1999), then published another Ancient Egyptian story, ''[[Warlock (Smith novel)|Warlock]]'' (2001).{{Citation needed|date=November 2021}}

''[[Blue Horizon (novel)|Blue Horizon]]'' (2003) was a historical Courtney tale and ''[[The Triumph of the Sun]]'' (2005) had the Courtneys meet the Ballantynes. ''[[The Quest (novel)|The Quest]]'' (2007) was in Ancient Egypt then ''[[Assegai (novel)|Assegai]]'' (2009) had the Courtneys. ''[[Those in Peril]]'' (2011) was contemporary, as was ''[[Vicious Circle (novel)|Vicious Circle]]'' (2013). ''[[Desert God]]'' (2014) brought Smith back to Ancient Egypt.{{Citation needed|date=November 2021}}

===Later career: Move to HarperCollins and using co-writers===
In December 2012, it was announced that Smith was leaving his English-language publisher of 45 years, Pan Macmillan, to move to [[HarperCollins]]. As part of his new six book deal, Smith wrote select novels with co-writers, in addition to writing books on his own. In a press release Smith was quoted as saying: "For the past few years my fans have made it very clear that they would like to read my novels and revisit my family of characters faster than I can write them. For them, I am willing to make a change to my working methods so the stories in my head can reach the page more frequently."<ref>{{cite web |website= HarperCollins Publishers |title= Wilbur Smith Moves to HarperCollins |url= http://corporate.harpercollins.com/us/press-releases/55/WILBUR%20SMITH%20MOVES%20TO%20HARPERCOLLINS}}</ref>

The first of the co-written novels was ''[[Golden Lion (novel)|Golden Lion]]'' (2015), a Courtney novel. ''[[Predator (Wilbur Smith novel)|Predator]]'' (2016) was contemporary. ''[[Pharaoh (Wilbur Smith novel)|Pharaoh]]'' (2016) brought him back to Ancient Egypt.<ref>{{cite web |last= Black |first= Eleanor |title= Wilbur Smith at 82: "I've never been happier" With his 36th novel topping bestseller lists and a hot young wife at his side, life is peachy for Wilbur Smith |website= Stuff |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/73147232/Wilbur-Smith-at-82-I-ve-never-been-happier |date= 24 October 2015}}</ref> In 2021 Picadilly Press published two books for children by Wilbur Smith, co-written with Chris Wakling  – ''Cloudburst''<ref>{{cite web |last= Smith |first= Wilbur |title=Cloudbust |website= Wilbur Smith Books |url= https://www.wilbursmithbooks.com/books/jack-courtney-cloudburst |access-date=14 March 2021}}</ref> and ''Thunderbolt''.<ref>{{cite web |last= Sanders |first= Patrick |title= Thunderbolt |website= The School Reading List |url= https://schoolreadinglist.co.uk/childrens-book-reviews/thunderbolt/ |access-date= 14 March 2021}}</ref>

===Move to Bonnier Zaffre===
In 2017 Smith left Harper Collins to join [[Bonnier Group| Bonnier Zaffre]], which gave them language rights to eight new books, together with the English language rights to 34 of Smith’s backlist titles.<ref>{{cite web |last= Cowdrey |first= Katherine |title= Bonnier Zaffre poaches Wilbur Smith in eight-figure deal |publisher= The Bookseller |date= 16 June 2017 |url= https://www.thebookseller.com/news/bonnier-zaffre-announces-eight-figure-deal-wilbur-smith-572136 |accessdate= 15 October 2021}}</ref> His new publisher announced at the time of the signing that they would continue the existing release schedule, instigated by HarperCollins, of two titles per year with a number of co-authors, including Corban Addison, David Churchill, Tom Harper and [[Imogen Robertson]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2021}}

In 2018 he published his autobiography ''On Leopard Rock''.<ref name=Smith/>

Smith then met a young divorcée named Danielle Thomas, who had been born in the same town and had read all of his books, and thought they were wonderful. They married in 1971.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article52264558 |title= The secluded life that inspires best-sellers |newspaper= [[The Australian Women's Weekly]] |location= Australia |date= 7 April 1982 |access-date= 15 January 2020 |page=56 |via=Trove }}</ref> Smith later said "she manipulated me.

<blockquote>The first part of our marriage was great. The last part was hell. Suddenly I was living with a different person. They chopped out half Danielle's brain and her personality changed. She became very difficult. I found it very, very hard to spend a lot of time with her because her moods would flick back and forth. She'd say, 'Why am I dying and you are well? It's unfair.' I'd say, 'Look, life isn't fair.' But when she passed away, I was sitting next to her, holding her hand as she took her last breath.<ref name="wilbur">{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3639476/Wilbur-the-womanizer.html |last= Thomas |first= David |title= Wilbur the womanizer |work= Daily Telegraph |date= 29 March 2005|access-date= 14 March 2013}}</ref></blockquote>

He met his fourth wife, a [[Tajiks|Tadjik]] woman named Mokhiniso Rakhimova, in a [[WHSmith]] bookstore in London on 18 January 2000. <ref name=Smith/> The two fell in love and married in Cape Town in May 2000. She was a law student studying at Moscow University and younger than him by 39 years.
On their relationship, Smith said:

"It really was love at first sight—and now she's got the best English teacher in the world. Of course people ask about the age gap, but I just say, 'What's 39 years?' Sure, she's young enough to be my daughter, so what?"<ref name="heraldscotland.com"/>

When Smith married Danielle Thomas, he cut off contact with his son Shaun and daughter Christian. He was also estranged from his son Lawrence. "My relationship with their mothers broke down and because of what the law was they went with their mothers and were imbued with their mothers' morality in life and they were not my people any more", he said. "They didn't work. They didn't behave in a way I like. I'm quite a selfish person. I'm worried about my life and the people who are really important to me."<ref name="express"/> He became close to Danielle's son from a previous relationship, Dieter Schmidt, and adopted him. Smith and Shaun subsequently reconciled.<ref name="wilbur"/> In 2002 he and Schmidt wound up in court in a dispute over assets and they became estranged. Smith:
<blockquote>"What I do, and I know it's a mistake but I just can't help myself, is I get into a relationship and I just want to give that person everything... I'm overgenerous. Then if they turn on me, I cut them off, it's finished. I'm not the easiest guy in the world, I can tell you, but if you are onside with me you can have everything, I'll lay down my life for you, you can go and help yourself to the bank account virtually.

In July 1989 the Smiths' domestic servant Gladys Siqele (who had been employed by Smith for 21 years) was killed by a hit-and-run driver while walking with a friend outside the Smith home in Bishopscourt, Cape Town. The Smiths posted a [[South African rand|R]] 10,000 reward for information on the driver. Eventually a 32-year-old police sergeant, Jacobus Michael Charles confessed to the killing.<ref name=Smith/>

Smith’s father had owned a [[Tiger Moth]] during the period when the family was cattle ranching. Smith followed in his footsteps gaining a [[private pilot’s licence]] in the mid-to-late 1960s, which allowed him to fly all over Africa.

==Influences==
As a child, Smith enjoyed reading ''[[Biggles]]'' books and ''[[Just William]]'' (1922), as well as the works of [[John Buchan]], [[C. S. Forester]] and [[H. Rider Haggard]].<ref name="early"/> <ref name=Smith/> Other authors he admired include [[Lawrence Durrell]], [[Robert Graves]], [[Ernest Hemingway]] and [[John Steinbeck]].<ref>{{cite web |title= Wilbur Smith, author of Those in Peril, answers Ten Terrifying Questions| website= Booktopia |date= 22 March 2011 |url= http://blog.booktopia.com.au/2011/03/22/wilbur-smith-author-of-those-in-peril-answers-ten-terrifying-questions/ |access-date= 22 March 2013}}</ref>

"I always think I am from the 17th century", said Smith. "I have no interest in technology, or to rush, rush, rush through life. I like to take time to smell the roses and the buffalo dung."<ref name=Cecil>{{cite news |last= Adams |first= Tim |title= Wilbur Smith: 'Poor Cecil the lion was going downhill fast – that dentist probably did his pride a&nbsp;favour' |newspaper= The Guardian |date= 3 October 2015 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/03/wilbur-smith-cecil-the-lion-going-downhill-fast-dentist-did-pride-a-favour |access-date= 15 October 2021}}</ref>

He says he has tried to live by the advice of Charles Pick, his [[Heinemann (publisher)|first publisher]]:
<blockquote>He said, "Write only about those things you know well." Since then I have written only about Africa... He said, "Do not write for your publishers or for your imagined readers. Write only for yourself." This was something that I had learned for myself. Charles merely confirmed it for me. Now, when I sit down to write the first page of a novel, I never give a thought to who will eventually read it. He said, "Don't talk about your books with anybody, even me, until they are written." Until it is written a book is merely smoke on the wind. It can be blown away by a careless word. I write my books while other aspiring authors are talking theirs away. He said, "Dedicate yourself to your calling, but read widely and look at the world around you, travel and live your life to the full, so that you will always have something fresh to write about." It was advice I have taken very much to heart. I have made it part of my personal philosophy. When it is time to play, I play very hard. I travel and hunt and scuba dive and climb mountains and try to follow the advice of [[Rudyard Kipling]]; "Fill the unforgiving minute with sixty seconds' worth of distance run." When it is time to write, I write with all my heart and all my mind.<ref name=Busy/></blockquote>

==Criticism==

Although many respected historians and authentic news letters endorse Smith's work, some critics have accused it of not having  been thoroughly researched. One of Smith's main critics, Martin Hall, asserts in his article in the ''[[Journal of Southern African Studies]]'' that the novels present biased, illiberal views against African nationalism.{{cn|date=September 2021}} Other critics claim that misogynistic, homophobic, and racist assumptions<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southafrica.info/pls/procs/iac.page?p_t1=690&p_t2=1823&p_t3=2662&p_t4=0&p_dynamic=YP&p_content_id=923834&p_site_id=38 |title=The 1960s: writing in opposition |publisher=SouthAfrica.info |date=19 April 2001 |access-date=6 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607033553/http://www.southafrica.info/pls/procs/iac.page?p_t1=690&p_t2=1823&p_t3=2662&p_t4=0&p_dynamic=YP&p_content_id=923834&p_site_id=38 |archive-date=7 June 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lclark.edu/~peck/pubs/Beware/JCAS-updated.pdf |title=Beware Wilbur Smith's Gaboon Adder |access-date=6 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627060509/http://www.lclark.edu/~peck/pubs/Beware/JCAS-updated.pdf |archive-date=27 June 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> as well as political agendas<ref>[[Martin Hall (academic)|Martin Hall]], "The Legend of the Lost City; Or, the Man with Golden Balls".
