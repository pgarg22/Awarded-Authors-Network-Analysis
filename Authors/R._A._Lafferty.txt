'''Raphael Aloysius Lafferty''' (November 7, 1914{{spaced ndash}}March 18, 2002) was an American [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] writer known for his original use of [[language]], [[metaphor]], and [[narrative structure]],<ref>[[Gene Wolfe]] wrote in an introduction to ''Episodes of the Argo'' that "[Lafferty may be] the most original writer in the history of literature"; [[Michael Swanwick]] has written that "if there were no Lafferty, we would lack the imagination to invent him", this is quoted on the back cover of the original edition of ''Lafferty in Orbit''; [[Neil Gaiman]] has said that "[Lafferty's] stories are without precedent"; [[Harlan Ellison]] wrote that "Lafferty defies categorization; his work is unlike anyone else's"... See "Quotations about Lafferty" for more: http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/R._A._Lafferty</ref> as well as for his [[etymology|etymological]] wit. He also wrote a set of four autobiographical novels, ''In a Green Tree''; a history book, ''The Fall of Rome''; and several novels of historical fiction.

In March 2011, it was announced in [[Locus (magazine)|''Locus'']] that the copyrights to 29 Lafferty novels and 225 short stories were up for sale.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfsignal.com/archives/2011/03/sf-tidbits-for-3311/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-03-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307004152/http://www.sfsignal.com/archives/2011/03/sf-tidbits-for-3311/ |archive-date=2011-03-07 }} http://www.sfsite.com/news/2011/03/02/lafferty-estate-for-sale/ http://locusmag.com/2011/Ads/digitallafferty.jpg</ref> <!-- TODO: location of ad; specific date of publication; who is the default buyer at 70k, the Locus Foundation as claimed by http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=R._A._Lafferty&diff=prev&oldid=418161910 ? -->  The literary estate was soon thereafter purchased by the magazine's nonprofit foundation, under the auspices of board member [[Neil Gaiman]].<ref>http://thislandpress.com/11/05/2014/lafferty-lost-and-found/?read=complete</ref>

==Biography==
Lafferty was born on November 7, 1914, in [[Neola, Iowa]] to Hugh David Lafferty, a broker dealing in oil leases and royalties, and Julia Mary Burke, a teacher; he was the youngest of five siblings. His first name, Raphael, derived from the day on which he was expected to be born--(the Feast of [[Raphael (archangel)|St. Raphael]]). When he was 4, his family moved to [[Perry, Oklahoma]]. He graduated from [[Cascia Hall Preparatory School|Cascia Hall]]<ref name="Mar 2002">"Sci-fi author R.A. Lafferty rites set." Tulsa World 21 Mar. 2002, Final Home Edition, NEWS: 12. NewsBank. Web. 31 Mar. 2010.</ref> and later attended night school at the [[University of Tulsa]] for two years starting in 1933, mostly studying math and German, but left before graduating. He then began to work for Clark Electric Co. in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], and apparently a newspaper as well<!-- is there proof of this? do we know which newspaper? -->; during this period (1939–1942), he attended the International Correspondence School.

R. A. Lafferty lived most of his life in Tulsa, with his sister, Anna Lafferty. Lafferty enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1942. After training in [[Texas]], [[North Carolina]], [[Florida]], and [[California]], he was sent to the [[South Pacific Area]], serving in Australia, [[New Guinea]], [[Morotai]], and the [[Philippines]]. When he left the Army in 1946, he had become a 1st Sergeant serving as a [[Staff Sergeant#United States military|staff sergeant]] and had received an [[Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20041025093113/https://www-perscom.army.mil/tagd/tioh/Awards/ASIATIC-PACIFIC1.html]. He never married.

Lafferty did not begin writing until the 1950s, but he wrote thirty-two novels and more than two hundred short stories, most of them at least nominally science fiction. His first published story was "The Wagons" in ''New Mexico Quarterly Review'' in 1959. His first published science fiction story was "Day of the Glacier", in ''The Original Science Fiction Stories'' in 1960, and his first published novel was ''Past Master'' in 1968.<ref name="nyt020329">{{cite news |work=The New York Times |title=Rafael A. Lafferty, 87, Science Fiction Writer |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/29/us/rafael-a-lafferty-87-science-fiction-writer.html?scp=15 |date=March 29, 2002 |access-date=March 31, 2010}}</ref>

Until 1971, Lafferty worked as an [[Electrical engineering|electrical engineer]]. After that, he spent his time writing until around 1980, when his output declined due to a stroke. He stopped writing regularly in 1984.<ref name="Locus"/> In 1994, he suffered an even more severe stroke. He died 18 March 2002, aged 87 in a nursing home in [[Broken Arrow, Oklahoma]]. His collected papers, artifacts, and ephemera were donated to the University of Tulsa's McFarlin Library, Department of Special Collections and University Archives. Other manuscripts are housed in the [[University of Iowa]]'s Library special collections department.

Lafferty's funeral took place at Christ the King Catholic Church in Tulsa, where he regularly attended daily Mass. He is buried at St. Rose Catholic Cemetery in Perry.<ref name="Mar 2002"/>

==Selected works==
Lafferty's quirky prose drew from traditional storytelling styles, largely from the Irish and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], and his [[Shaggy dog story|shaggy-dog characters and tall tales]] are unique in science fiction. Little of Lafferty's writing is considered typical of the genre. His stories are closer to [[tall tale]]s than traditional science fiction and are deeply influenced by his [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] beliefs; ''Fourth Mansions'', for example, draws on ''[[El Castillo Interior|The Interior Mansions]]'' of [[Teresa of Avila]].

His writings, both topically and stylistically, are not easy to categorize. Plot is frequently secondary to other elements of Lafferty's writing; while this style has resulted in a loyal cult following, it causes some readers to give up attempting to read his work.

Not all of Lafferty's work was science fiction or fantasy; his novel ''Okla Hannali'' (1972), published by University of Oklahoma Press, tells the story of the [[Choctaw]] in [[Mississippi]], and after the [[Trail of Tears]], in [[Oklahoma]], through an account of the larger-than-life character Hannali and his large family. This novel was thought of highly by the novelist [[Dee Brown (novelist)|Dee Brown]], author of ''[[Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee]]'' (1970), who on the back cover of the edition of published by the [[University of Oklahoma Press]],  writes "The history of the Choctaw Indians has been told before and is still being told, but it has never been told in the way Lafferty tells it ... Hannali is a buffalo bull of a man who should become one of the enduring characters in the literature of the American Indian." He also wrote, "It is art applied to history so that the legend of the Choctaws, their great and small men, their splendid humor, and their tragedies are filled with life and breath."

Kornbluth|C.M. Kornbluth's]] "The Meeting"). <ref>[http://worldcon.org/hy.html#73] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120190123/http://www.worldcon.org/hy.html |date=2013-01-20 }}</ref>

He received [[Nebula Award]] nominations for "In Our Block", "Slow Tuesday Night", ''Past Master'', ''Fourth Mansions'', "Continued on Next Rock", "Entire And Perfect Chrysolite", and ''The Devil is Dead''. He never received a Nebula award.<ref name="Locus"/>

His collection ''Lafferty in Orbit'' was nominated for a [[World Fantasy Award]], and in 1990, Lafferty received a World Fantasy Lifetime Achievement Award. His 1992 collection ''Iron Tears'' was also a finalist for the [[Philip K. Dick Award]].<ref name="Locus"/> In 2002, he received the [[Cordwainer Smith]] Foundation's Rediscovery award.<ref>[http://www.cordwainer-smith.com/lafferty.htm]</ref>

The [[Oklahoma Department of Libraries]] granted him the [[Arrell Gibson]] Lifetime Achievement Award in 1995.<ref>[http://www.odl.state.ok.us/ocb/pastgib.htm]</ref>

''[[Fourth Mansions]]'' was also named by [[David Pringle]] as one of his selections for ''[[Modern Fantasy: The Hundred Best Novels]]''.

==Writing style==
"<nowiki>[Once a]</nowiki> French publisher nervously asked whether Lafferty minded being compared to [[G. K. Chesterton]] (another Catholic author), and there was a terrifying silence that went on and on. Was the great man hideously offended? Eventually, very slowly, he said: 'You're on the right track, kid,' and wandered away."<ref>From an [[SFX magazine]] column by [[David Langford]]; issue #92, June 2002</ref>

In his 2006 short story collection ''[[Fragile Things]]'', [[Neil Gaiman]] includes a short story called "Sunbird" written in the style of Lafferty. In the introduction, he says this about Lafferty:

<blockquote>
There was a writer from Tulsa, Oklahoma (he died in 2002), who was, for a little while in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the best short story writer in the world. His name was R. A. Lafferty, and his stories were unclassifiable and odd and inimitable -- you knew you were reading a Lafferty story within a sentence. When I was young I wrote to him, and he wrote back.

"Sunbird" was my attempt to write a Lafferty story, and it taught me a number of things, mostly how much harder they are than they look....<ref>Introduction to ''Fragile Things: Short Fictions and Wonders'' by Neil Gaiman. published 2006 by William Morrow. page xxvii</ref>
</blockquote>

Gaiman and Lafferty had corresponded for several years during Gaiman's adolescence; he remembered Lafferty's letters as "filled with typical cock-eyed Lafferty humour and observations, wise and funny and sober all at once."<ref>"Lafferty", Neil Gaiman, ''Locus'', May 2002, p.68.</ref>
