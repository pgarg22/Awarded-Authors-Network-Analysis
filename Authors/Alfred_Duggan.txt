'''Alfred Duggan''' (born '''Alfredo León Duggan'''; 1903–1964) was an English historian and [[archaeologist]], and a well-known historical novelist in the 1950s. His novels are known for meticulous historical research.

==Background==
Though brought up in Britain, he was born Alfredo León Duggan in Lomas de Zamora, [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], to a family of wealthy landowners of Irish descent. His family moved to Britain when he was two years old. His father Alfredo Huberto Duggan, a first generation [[Irish Argentinian]], was appointed in 1905 to the Argentine Legation in London, and died in 1915. In 1917, his mother, the [[Alabama]]-born [[Grace Curzon, Marchioness Curzon of Kedleston|Grace Elvira Hinds]], daughter of the U.S. Consul General in Rio de Janeiro, became the second wife of [[Lord Curzon]], the former [[Viceroy of India]]. Duggan and his brother [[Hubert Duggan|Hubert]] (1904–1943) were brought up in Britain at Curzon's seats, and were educated first at [[Wixenford School|Wixenford]]<ref>[[Grace Curzon, Marchioness Curzon of Kedleston]], ''Reminiscences'' (1955), p. 45.</ref> and [[Eton College|Eton]]. Thereafter Alfred went to [[Balliol College]] at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], where he became acquainted with [[Anthony Powell]] and [[Evelyn Waugh]].<ref>John Derbyshire [http://www.olimu.com/journalism/Texts/Criticism/Duggan.htm "Alfred Duggan's Past"] ''New Criterion'' February 2005.</ref> He often features in Waugh's letters and diaries of the period, and his South American background may have influenced the character of [[Anthony Blanche]] in ''[[Brideshead Revisited]]'', though Waugh described the character as "2/3 [[Brian Howard (poet)|Brian [Howard]]] and 1/3 [[Harold Acton]]. People think it was all Harold, who is a much sweeter and saner man [than Howard]."<ref name="Waugh 1980 505">{{Cite book |last=Waugh |first=Evelyn |author2=Edited by Mark Amory |year=1980 |title=[[The Letters of Evelyn Waugh]] |publisher=[[Weidenfeld & Nicolson]] |isbn=1-85799-245-8 |page= 505}}</ref>

Alfred Duggan kept a car while at Oxford, one of the few students with sufficient funds and influence to do so; the University Statutes prohibited undergraduates from keeping a car within a certain distance of the town centre at [[Carfax, Oxford|Carfax]], and so Duggan kept his, an early [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]], just outside the limit of the jurisdiction of the University [[Proctor]]s, and would regularly drive himself and his friends to and from London during the social season. At Oxford he was part of the [[Hypocrites' Club]].<ref name="anthonypowell">{{Cite web |title=AP The Anthony Powell Newsletter 65 |url=http://anthonypowell.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/nl65.pdf |website=anthonypowell |accessdate=21 January 2018}}</ref>

During 1938–1941, Duggan served with the [[London Irish Rifles]], with active service in the [[Norwegian Campaign]]. For the rest of the Second World War he worked in an aeroplane factory.

In 1953, Duggan married Laura Hill. They went to live in [[Ross-on-Wye]], where he died in April 1964.<ref>''The Spectator'' (10 July 1964).</ref> According to a review by [[John Derbyshire]], Duggan "in later years, his inheritance gone... adjusted philosophically to his changed circumstances, living a bookish and domestic life utterly at odds with the extravagant dissipation of his youth. He seems to have been a devoted husband and parent, and a loyal friend."<ref>''The New Criterion'', February 2005 [https://www.johnderbyshire.com/Reviews/Considerations/duggan.html Retrieved 3 June 2019.]</ref>

==Literature==
Duggan's novels are known for their basis of meticulous historical research. He also wrote popular histories of [[Ancient Rome]] and the [[Middle Ages]]. ''Knight with Armour'', his first novel, appeared in 1946. He visited practically every place and battlefield described, since he was also an archaeologist, having worked on excavations in [[Istanbul]] during the 1930s.

Unlike many historical novelists, he does not idealise his subjects. A few characters are noble, some rather nasty, many mixed in their motives. Some of the novels can be seen as funny, in a dry ''noir'' style. A recurring theme is the slow moral corruption of a character who begins with an exalted opinion of himself as noble, wise and brave, but gradually compromises himself morally.

Most of the stories are told from the viewpoint of the ruling class – sometimes the ruler, sometimes a knight or noble. In English history, his novels show a general approval of the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]].

==Reception==
Duggan's novel ''Three's Company'' (1958) was praised by [[Rex Warner]], who stated, "Mr. Duggan has succeeded in making him (Lepidus) a modern character, but he has also firmly placed him in his own age. ''Three's Company'' is a most competent piece of work, scholarly, alive, and suggestive."<ref>Rex Warner, "Two Not So Noble Romans", ''[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|The Saturday Review]]'', 30 August 1958, p. 11.</ref> In an introduction to Duggan's novel ''Count Bohemond'' (1964), [[Evelyn Waugh]] said Duggan's "literary style remained constant. It is as crisp and clear in this posthumous novel as in his first.... There is no groping in Alfred's work. At the age of forty-seven he published his first book. It was lucid and masterly, absolutely free of affectation or ostentation."<ref>Evelyn Waugh, "Preface", in Alfred Duggan, ''Count Bohemond'' (Reprint). London : Cassell Military, 2002, pp. 5–7. {{ISBN|9780304362738}}</ref>
