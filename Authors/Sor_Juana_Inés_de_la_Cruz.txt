Sor Juana lived during [[Mexico|Mexico's]] [[Spanish Empire|colonial period]], making her a contributor both to early Spanish literature as well as to the broader literature of the [[Spanish Golden Age]]. Beginning her studies [[Child prodigy|at a young age]], Sor Juana was fluent in Latin and also wrote in [[Nahuatl]],<ref>TOWNSEND, C. (2015). SOR JUANA'S NAHUATL.

==Life==

===Early life===
[[File:MainHousePanoaya.JPG|left|thumb|280x280px|[[Hacienda]] of Panoaya in [[Amecameca]], residence of the '''Ramírez de Santillana''' family.]]
''Doña'' '''Inés de Asbaje y Ramírez de Santillana''' was born in [[Tepetlixpa|San Miguel Nepantla]] (now called ''Nepantla de Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz'') near [[Mexico City]]. Owing to her [[Spain|Spanish]] ancestry and [[Mexico|Mexican]] birth, Inés is considered a [[Criollo people|Criolla]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kennett|first=Frances|date=May 2003|title=Sor Juana and the Guadalupe|journal=Feminist Theology|volume=11|issue=3|pages=307–324|doi=10.1177/096673500301100305|s2cid=144363376}}</ref> She was the [[illegitimate child]] of [[Don (honorific)|Don]] ''Pedro Manuel de Asuaje y Vargas-Machuca'', a Spanish officer, and [[Don (honorific)|Doña]] I''sabel Ramírez de Santillana y Rendón'', a wealthy [[Criollo people|criolla]], who inhabited the [[Hacienda]] of Panoaya, close to [[Mexico City]]. She was baptized on the 2nd of December [[1651]] with the name of '''Inés''' ("''Juana''" was only added after she entered the convent) described on the baptismal rolls as "''a daughter of the Church''".<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Arenal|first1=Electa|last2=Powell|first2=Amanda|date=1993|title=A Life Without and Within: Juana Ramírez / Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz (1648/51-1695)|journal=Women's Studies Quarterly|volume=21|issue=1/2|pages=67–80|issn=0732-1562|jstor=40003874}}</ref> The name ''Inés'' came from her maternal aunt ''Doña'' Inés Ramírez de Santillana, who received the name herself from her [[Andalusia|Andalusian]] grandmother ''Doña'' Inés de Brenes.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Cervantes|first=Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de|title=La Fe de bautismo de "Inés hija de la iglesia" de Sor Juana|url=http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/obra-visor/la-fe-de-bautismo-de-ines-hija-de-la-iglesia-de-sor-juana-774883/html/7661e678-bc4d-467d-ab62-6756ac7edbb0_2.html|access-date=2021-09-21|website=Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes|language=es}}</ref> The name ''Inés'' was also present through their cousin Doña Inés de Brenes y Mendoza, married to a grandson of [[:es:Antonio_de_Saavedra_Guzmán|Antonio de Saavedra Guzmán]], the first ever published [[Americas|American]]-born poet. 

Her biological father, according to all accounts, was completely absent from her life. However, thanks to her maternal family, who owned a very productive ''[[hacienda]]'' in [[Amecameca]], Inés lived a comfortable life with her mother on his estate, Panoaya, accompanied by an illustrious group of relatives who constantly visited or where visited in their surrounding haciendas.<ref name="aap">[https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/sor-juana-in%C3%A9s-de-la-cruz "Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz", Academy of American Poets]</ref>[[File:Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Statue of Sor Juana Inés in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]].]]
[[File:Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz.jpg|left|thumb|Doña Inés de Asuaje y Ramírez de Santillana later called ''Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz'']]
During her childhood, Inés often hid in the ''[[hacienda]]'' chapel to read her grandfather's books from the adjoining library, something forbidden to girls. By the age of three, she had learned how to read and write Latin. By the age of five, she reportedly could do accounts. At age eight, she composed a poem on the [[Eucharist]].<ref name="Appletons" /> By adolescence, Inés had mastered Greek logic, and at age thirteen she was teaching [[Latin]] to young children. She also learned the [[Aztec]] language of [[Nahuatl]] and wrote some short poems in that language.<ref name="aap" /> 

In 1664, at the age of 16, Inés was sent to live in [[Mexico City]]. She even asked her mother's permission to disguise herself as a male student so that she could enter the university there, without success. Without the ability to obtain formal education, Juana continued her studies privately. Her family's influential position had gained her the position of [[lady-in-waiting]] at the colonial [[viceroy]]'s court,<ref name=":5" /> where she came under the tutelage of the [[Viceroy|Vicereine]] ''Donna'' [[:es:Leonor Carreto|Eleonora del Carretto]], member of one of [[Italy]]'s most illustrious families, and wife of the [[Viceroy]] of [[New Spain]] Don [[Antonio Sebastián de Toledo]], [[Marquis of Mancera]]. The viceroy Marquis de Mancera, wishing to test the learning and intelligence of the 17-year-old, invited several theologians, jurists, philosophers, and poets to a meeting, during which she had to answer many questions unprepared and explain several difficult points on various scientific and literary subjects. The manner in which she acquitted herself astonished all present and greatly increased her reputation. Her literary accomplishments garnered her fame throughout [[New Spain]]. She was much admired in the viceregal court, and she received several proposals of marriage, which she declined.<ref name="Appletons" />

[[File:Claustro de Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz DSC 1099 (33088891783).jpg|thumb]]
In 1667, she entered the [[Monastery]] of St. Joseph, a community of the [[Discalced Carmelites|Discalced Carmelite nuns]], as a [[postulant]], where she remained but a few months. Later, in 1669, she entered the monastery of the [[Hieronymites|Hieronymite nuns]], which had more relaxed rules, where she changed her name to Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, probably in reference to [[Juana de la Cruz Vázquez Gutiérrez|Sor Juana de la Cruz Vázquez Gutiérrez]] who was a Spanish nun whose erudition earned her one of the few dispensations for women to preach the gospel. Another potential namesake was [[John of the Cross|Saint Juan de la Cruz]], one of the most accomplished authors of the Spanish Baroque. She chose to become a nun so that she could study as she wished since she wanted "to have no fixed occupation which might curtail my freedom to study."<ref name="Biography" /> 

In the convent and perhaps earlier, Sor Juana became intimate friends with fellow savant, Don [[Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora]], who visited her in the convent's locutorio.<ref name=":1" /> She stayed cloistered in the Convent of Santa Paula of the Hieronymite in Mexico City from 1669 until her death in 1695, and there she studied, wrote, and collected a large library of books. The Viceroy and Vicereine of New Spain became her patrons; they supported her and had her writings published in Spain.<ref name="Biography" /> She addressed some of her poems to paintings of her friend and patron [[María Luisa Manrique de Lara y Gonzaga]], daughter of [[Vespasiano I Gonzaga|Vespasiano Gonzaga]], Duca di Guastala, Luzara e Rechiolo and Inés María Manrique, 9th Countess de Paredes, which she also addressed as Lísida.

In November 1690, the bishop of Puebla, [[Manuel Fernández de Santa Cruz]] published, under the pseudonym of Sor Filotea, and without her permission, Sor Juana's critique of a 40-year-old sermon by [[Father António Vieira]], a Portuguese Jesuit preacher.<ref name=":18">{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1072584/Manuel-Fernandez-de-Santa-Cruz|title=Manuel Fernandez de Santa Cruz, bishop of Puebla|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=2016-04-15}}</ref> Although Sor Juana's intentions for the work, called ''[[:es:Carta atenagórica|Carta Atenagórica]]'' are left to interpretation, many scholars have opted to interpret the work as a challenge to the hierarchical structure of religious authority.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Routledge research companion to the works of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz|last=Bergmann, Emilie L., 1949- Herausgeber.

In response to her critics, Sor Juana wrote a letter, ''Respuesta a Sor Filotea de la Cruz'' (''Reply to Sister Philotea''),<ref>{{cite web|title=Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz|url=http://www.ensayistas.org/antologia/XVII/sorjuana/sorjuana1.htm|website=www.ensayistas.org}}</ref> in which she defended women's right to formal education.<ref name=":13" /> She also advocated for women's right to serve as intellectual authorities, not only through the act of writing, but also through the publication of their writing.<ref name=":13" /> By putting women, specifically older women, in positions of authority, Sor Juana argued, women could educate other women. Resultingly, Sor Juana argued, this practice could also avoid potentially dangerous situations involving male teachers in intimate settings with young female students.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Stuart A.P.|title=The library : an illustrated history|date=2009|publisher=[[Skyhorse Pub.]]|location=New York, NY|isbn=9781602397064|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/libraryillustrat0000murr}}</ref>

In addition to her status as a woman in a self-prescribed position of authority, Sor Juana's radical position made her an increasingly controversial figure. She famously remarked by quoting an Aragonese poet and echoing St. Teresa of Ávila: "One can perfectly well philosophize while cooking supper."<ref>{{cite web|title=Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz, Mexican poet and scholar|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sor-Juana-Ines-de-la-Cruz#ref959|website=Encyclopædia Britannica}}</ref> In response, [[Francisco de Aguiar y Seijas]], [[Archbishop of Mexico]] joined other high-ranking officials in condemning Sor Juana's "waywardness." In addition to opposition she received for challenging the patriarchal structure of the [[Catholic Church]], Sor Juana was repeatedly criticized for believing that her writing could achieve the same philanthropic goals as community work.<ref name=":13" />

By 1693, she seemingly ceased to write, rather than risking official [[censure]]. Although there is no undisputed evidence of her renouncing devotion to letters, there are documents showing her agreeing to undergo [[penance]].<ref name=":10">{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ap-art-history/later-europe-and-americas/enlightenment-revolution/a/cabrera-portrait-of-sor-juana-ins-de-la-cruz|title=Cabrera, Portrait of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz|website=Khan Academy|language=en|access-date=2019-12-05}}</ref> Her name is affixed to such a document in 1694, but given her deep natural lyricism, the tone of the supposed handwritten penitentials is in rhetorical and autocratic Church formulae; one is signed "''Yo, la Peor de Todas''" ("''I, the worst of all women"'').<ref name=":10" /> She is said to have sold all her books,<ref name="Appletons">{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Cruz, Juana Inés de la|year=1900}}</ref> then an extensive library of over 4,000 volumes, and her musical and scientific instruments as well.

==Works==

=== Poetry ===

====''First Dream''====
[[File:Claustro de Sor Juana.jpg|thumb|350px|left|The former [[Convent]] of [[St Jerome]] in [[Mexico City]].]]

''First Dream'', a long philosophical and descriptive ''[[Silva (Spanish strophe)|silva]]'' (a poetic form combining verses of 7 and 11 syllables), "deals with the shadow of night beneath which a person<ref>In the final verse we come to know it is Sor Juana herself because she uses the first person, feminine.</ref> falls asleep in the midst of quietness and silence, where night and day animals participate, either dozing or sleeping, all urged to silence and rest by Harpocrates. The person's body ceases its ordinary operations,<ref>Sor Juana is inspired by Fray Luis de Granada's ''Introducción al Símbolo de la Fe'', where an extended verbal description of physiological functions is the closest match to what is found in the poem.</ref> which are described in physiological and symbolical terms, ending with the activity of the imagination as an image-reflecting apparatus: the Pharos. From this moment, her soul, in a dream, sees itself free at the summit of her own intellect; in other words, at the ''apex'' of an own pyramid-like mount, which aims at God and is luminous.<ref>It must be understood that this light of intellect is Grace given by God. [https://poemascortosweb.com/ poemas cortos]</ref>

There, perched like an eagle, she contemplates the whole creation,<ref>This pinnacle of contemplation is clearly preceded by Saint Augustine (''Confessions'', X, VIII, 12), who also inspired Petrarch's letter about the contemplation of the world created by God from the summit of a mountain (in his letter ''Familiares'', IV, 1)</ref> but fails to comprehend such a sight in a single concept. Dazzled, the soul's intellect faces its own shipwreck, caused mainly by trying to understand the overwhelming abundance of the universe, until reason undertakes that enterprise, beginning with each individual creation, and processing them one by one, helped by the Aristotelic method of ten categories.<ref name="ru.ffyl.unam.mx">Olivares Zorrilla, Rocío. "The Eye of Imagination. Emblems in the Baroque Poem The Dream, by Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz", [http://ru.ffyl.unam.mx:8080/handle/10391/1405 ''Emblematica. An Interdisciplinary Journal for Emblem Studies'', volume 18 (2010): 111-61: 115-17.]</ref>

The soul cannot get beyond questioning herself about the traits and causes of a fountain and a flower, intimating perhaps that his method constitutes a useless effort, since it must take into account all the details, accidents, and mysteries of each being. By that time, the body has consumed all its nourishment, and it starts to move and wake up, soul and body are reunited. The poem ends with the Sun overcoming Night in a straightforward battle between luminous and dark armies, and with the poet's awakening.<ref name="ru.ffyl.unam.mx" />[[File:Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz. Pintura.jpg|thumb|220px|Convent of Santa Paula ([[Seville]])]]

==== Love Poems ====
Sor Juana's first volume of poetry, Inundación castálida, was published in Spain by the Vicereine Maria Luisa Manrique de Lara y
Gonzaga, Countess of Paredes, Marquise de la Laguna.<ref>Juana Inés de la Cruz, Joan Larkin, and Jaime Manrique. (2003) Sor Juana’s Love Poems. University of Wisconsin Press. 9-11.</ref> Many of her poems dealt with the subject of love and sensuality, and frequently her expressed desire was for women, such as in the poems "My Divine Lysi," "I Beg You, Señora," "Inez, When Someone Tells You You're a Bitch," "Portia, What Passion, What Blind Pain," and others. [[Jaime Manrique]], the Colombian American novelist, poet, essayist, educator, and translator, described her poetry thus: "her love poems are expressions of a complex and ambivalent modern psyche, and because they are so passionate and ferocious that when we read them we feel consumed by the naked intensity she achieves."<ref>Juana Inés de la Cruz, Joan Larkin, and Jaime Manrique.(2003) Sor Juana’s Love Poems. University of Wisconsin Press. 9-11.</ref>

An example of her love poetry, "Don't Go, My Darling. I Don't Want This to End Yet" (translated by Manrique and [[Joan Larkin]]):

Don't go, my darling. I don't want this to end yet.
This sweet fiction is all I have.
Hold me so I'll die happy,
thankful for your lies.

My breasts answer yours
magnet to magnet.
Why make love to me, then leave?
Why mock me?

Don't brag about your conquest—
I'm not your trophy.
Go ahead: reject these arms

that wrapped you in sumptuous silk.
Try to escape my arms, my breasts—
I'll keep you prisoner in my poem.<ref>Juana Inés de la Cruz, Joan Larkin, and Jaime Manrique. (2003) Sor Juana’s Love Poems. University of Wisconsin Press. 32-35. </ref>

==== Dramas ====
In addition to the two comedies outlined here (''House of Desires'' [<nowiki/>[[House of Desires|Los empeños de una casa]]]) and ''Love is but a Labyrinth'' [Amor es mas laberinto]), Sor Juana is attributed as the author of a possible ending to the comedy by Agustin de Salazar: ''The Second Celestina'' (La Segunda Celestina).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz|last=Kirk Rappaport|first=Pamela|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=1998|isbn=978-0826410436|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/sorjuanainesdela00kirk}}</ref>  In the 1990s, [[Guillermo Schmidhuber]] found a release of the comedy that contained a different ending than the otherwise known ending.  He proposed that those one thousand words were written by Sor Juana.  Some [[Literary criticism|literary critics]], such as [[Octavio Paz]],<ref>Paz, Octavio. «¿Azar o justicia», ''La segunda Celestina'', ed. Guillermo Schmidhuber. México: Vuelta, 1990, págs. 7-10.</ref> Georgina Sabat-Rivers,<ref>Georgina Sabat-Rivers, “Los problemas de La segunda Celestina” (Nueva Revista de Filología Hispánica 40 (1992), pp. 493-512.</ref> and [[Luis Leal (writer)|Luis Leal]]<ref>Buenos Aires: Biblioteca de textos universitarios, 1995, págs. 76-105</ref>) have accepted Sor Juana as the co-author, but others, such as [[Antonio Alatorre]]<ref>Alatorre, Antonio. «''La Segunda Celestina'' de Agustín de Salazar y Torres: ejercicio de crítica». ''Vuelta'', 46 (diciembre de 1990), págs. 46-52.</ref> and José Pascual Buxó, have refuted it.

=== Comedies ===
Scholars have debated the meaning of Juana's comedies. Julie Greer Johnson describes how Juana protested against the rigorously defined relationship between genders through her full-length comedies and humor. She argues that Juana recognized the negative view of women in comedy which was designed to uphold male superiority at the expense of women. By recognizing the power of laughter, Juana appropriated the purpose of humor, and used it as a socially acceptable medium with which to question notions of men and women.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=Julie Greer|title=Humor in Spain's American Colonies: The Case of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz|journal=Studies in American Humor|date=2000|volume=7|pages=35–47|publisher=Studies in American Humor, 2000|language=en}}</ref>

'''''Pawns of a House'''''

The work was first performed on [[October 4]], 1683, during the celebration of the Viceroy Count of Paredes’ first son's birth.<ref name=":3">García Valdés, pág. 45-50.</ref>  Some critics maintain that it could have been set up for the Archbishop [[Francisco de Aguiar y Seijas]]’ entrance to the capital, but this theory is not considered reliable.<ref name=":3" />

The story revolves around two couples who are in love but, by chance of fate, cannot yet be together. This [[comedy]] of errors is considered one of the most prominent works of late [[New Spanish Baroque|baroque Spanish-American]] literature.  One of its most peculiar characteristics is that the driving force in the story is a woman with a strong, decided personality who expresses her desires to a nun.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Los empeños de una casa|last=de la Cruz|first=Sor Juana Inés|publisher=Imprénta Clásica|year=1921|isbn=9781931010177|location=Madrid, España}}</ref> The protagonist of the story, Dona Leonor, fits the [[archetype]] perfectly.<ref name=":3" />

It is often considered the peak of Sor Juana's work and even the peak of all [[Mexican literature|New-Hispanic literature]]. ''Pawns of a House'' is considered a rare work in colonial Spanish-American theater due to the management of intrigue, representation of the complicated system of marital relationships, and the changes in urban life.<ref name=":3" />

'''''Love is but a Labyrinth'''''

The work premiered on February 11, 1689, during the celebration of the inauguration of the viceroyalty [[Gaspar de la Cerda, 8th Count of Galve|Gaspar de la Cerda y Mendoza]]. However, in his Essay on Psychology, Ezequiel A. Chavez mentions Fernandez del Castillo as a coauthor of this comedy.<ref name=":4">Chávez, pág. 140-142.</ref>

The plot takes on the well-known theme in [[Greek mythology]] of [[Theseus]]: a hero from [[Crete]] Island.  He fights against the [[Minotaur]] and awakens the love of [[Ariadne]] and Fedra.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hacia una lectura contemporanea de Amor es mas laberinto|last=Palacios Sanchez|first=Refugio Amada|publisher=Universidad Veracruzana|year=1997|isbn=978-9688344460}}</ref>  Sor Juana conceived Theseus as the archetype of the baroque hero, a model also used by her fellow countryman [[Juan Ruiz de Alarcón|Juan Ruis de Alarcon]]. Theseus’ triumph over the Minotaur does not make Theseus proud, but instead allows him to be humble.<ref name=":4" />

[[File:Sor Juana.JPG|thumb|left|Monument of Sor Juana in [[Chapultepec]].]]
=== Music ===
Besides poetry and philosophy, Sor Juana was interested in science, mathematics and music. The latter represents an important aspect, not only because musicality was an intrinsic part of the poetry of the time but also for the fact that she devoted a significant portion of her studies to the theory of instrumental tuning that, especially in the Baroque period, had reached a point of critical importance. So involved was Sor Juana in the study of music, that she wrote a treatise called El Caracol (unfortunately lost) that sought to simplify musical notation and solve the problems that Pythagorean tuning suffered.
In the writings of Juana Ines, it is possible to detect the importance of sound. We can observe this in two ways. First of all, the analysis of music and the study of musical temperament appears in several of her poems. For instance, in the following poem, Sor Juana delves into the natural notes and the accidents of musical notation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Long |first1=Pamela |title=De la música un cuaderno pedís': Musical Notation in Sor Juana's Works. |journal=Bulletin of Hispanic Studies |date=December 2006 |volume=83 |issue=6 |pages=497–507|doi=10.3828/bhs.83.6.4 }}</ref>

Propiedad es de natura<br>
que entre Dios y el hombre media,<br>
y del cielo el be cuadrado<br>
junto al be bemol de la tierra.<br>
(Villancico 220)

On the other, Sarah Finley<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Finley |first1=Sarah |title=Embodied Sound and Female Voice in Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz's Canon: romance 8 and El divino Narciso |journal=Revista de Estudios Hispánicos |date=2016 |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=191–216 |doi=10.1353/rvs.2016.0007|s2cid=164173642 }}</ref> offers an interesting idea. She argues that the visual is related with patriarchal themes, while the sonorous offers an alternative to the feminine space in the work of Sor Juana. As an example of this, Finley points out that Narciso falls in love with a voice, and not with a reflection.

===Other notable works===

One musical work attributed to Sor Juana survives from the archive of [[Metropolital Cathedral of Guatemala|Guatemala Cathedral]]. This is a [http://www.cpdl.org/wiki/images/f/f3/Cru-mad.pdf 4-part villancico, ''Madre, la de los primores''].

Other works include ''Hombres Necios'' (Foolish Men), and ''The Divine Narcissus''.

== Translations and interpretations ==
Octavio Paz is credited with re-establishing the importance of the historic Sor Juana in modern times,<ref name=":8" /> and other scholars have been instrumental in translating Sor Juana's work to other languages. The only translations of ''Carta Atenagorica'' are found in ''Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz: Selected Writings'' by Pamela Kirk Rappaport and ''The Tenth Muse: Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz'' by [[Fanchon Royer]].<ref name=":15" /> Translations of Sor Juana's ''La Respuesta'' are credited to Electa Arenal and Amanda Powell, [[Edith Grossman]], [[Margaret Sayers Peden|Margaret Seyers Peden]], and Alan S. Trubeblood.<ref name=":15" /> These translations are respectively found in ''The Answer/La Respuesta, Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz: Selected Works'', ''A Woman of Genius: The Intellectual Biography of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz'' and ''Poems, Protest, and a Dream'', and ''A Sor Juana Anthology''.<ref name=":15" />

Since Sor Juana's works were rediscovered after her death,<ref name=":8" /> scholarly interpretations and translations are both abundant and contrasting.

=== Octavio Paz ===
[[Octavio Paz]] is a [[Nobel Prize]] laureate and scholar. In the 1989 book, ''Sor Juana: Or, The Traps of Faith'' (translated from Spanish to English by [[Margaret Sayers Peden]]), Paz examines and contemplates Sor Juana's poetry and life in the context of the history of [[New Spain]], particularly focusing on the difficulties women then faced while trying to thrive in academic and artistic fields. Primarily, Paz aims to explain why Sor Juana chose to become a nun.<ref name=":7" /> In Juana Ramírez, Octavio Paz and Diane Marting find that Sor Juana's decision to become a nun stemmed from her refusal to marry; joining the convent, according to Paz and Marting, was a way for Juana to obtain authority and freedom without marrying.<ref name=":6" />

In his analyses of Sor Juana's poetry, Octavio Paz traces some of her influences to the Spanish writers of the [[Spanish Golden Age|Golden Age]] and the Hermetic tradition, mainly derived from the works of a noted [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] scholar of her era, [[Athanasius Kircher]]. Paz interprets Sor Juana's most ambitious and extensive poem, "First Dream" ("Primero Sueño") as a representation of the desire of knowledge through a number of [[Hermeticism|hermetic symbols]], albeit transformed in her own language and skilled image-making abilities. In conclusion, Paz makes the case that Sor Juana's works were the most important body of poetic work produced in the Americas until the arrival of 19th-century figures such as [[Emily Dickinson]] and [[Walt Whitman]].<ref name=":7" />

=== Tarsicio Herrera Zapién ===
[[Tarsicio Herrera Zapién]], a classical scholar, has also devoted much of his career to the study of Sor Juana's works. Some of his publications (in Spanish) include ''Buena fe y humanismo en Sor Juana: diálogos y ensayos: las obras {{Not a typo|latinas}}: los sorjuanistas recientes'' (1984); ''[[Ramón López Velarde|López Velarde]] y sor Juana, feministas opuestos: y cuatro ensayos sobre Horacio y Virgilio en México'' (1984); ''Poemas mexicanos universales: de Sor Juana a López Velarde'' (1989) and ''Tres siglos y cien vidas de Sor Juana'' (1995).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.asale.org/academicos/tarsicio-herrera-zapien|title=Tarsicio Herrera Zapién|website=www.asale.org|language=es|access-date=2019-12-07}}</ref>

=== Feminist analyses and translations ===
Scholars such as Scout Frewer argue that because Juana's advocacy for religious and intellectual authority would now be associated with [[feminism]], she was a [[Protofeminism|protofeminist]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Frewer|first=Scout|date=Spring 2018|title=Through the Lens of Proto-Feminist Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz: An Analysis of Six Modern Feminist Perspectives|url=https://journals.uvic.ca/index.php/plvsvltra/article/view/18159|journal=The Corvette|volume=4}}</ref> In the twenty-first century, [[Latin America|Latin American]] philosophers and scholars generally interpret Sor Juana as a feminist before the time of feminism.

For instance, scholars like Rachel O’Donnell argue that Sor Juana occupied a special place in between socially acceptable and socially unacceptable roles in seventeenth century Mexico. By examining Sor Juana intersectionally, they prioritize the context of [[New Spain]], specifically the influence of religion, race, and social norms, in understanding Sor Juana as a female [[Theology|theologian]] and poet.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=O’Donnell|first=Rachel|date=2015|title=Gender, Culture, and Knowledge in New Spain: Sor Juana's "To the Gentleman in Peru|journal=Women's Studies|volume=44|issue=8|pages=1114–1129|doi=10.1080/00497878.2015.1078213|s2cid=146608139}}</ref>

According to O’Donnell, in colonial Mexico, education was an undertaking reserved for men, especially activities like writing and reading.<ref name=":0" /> Consequently, scholars like Octavio Paz argue, religion became a way for women to avoid marriage. Since Sor Juana was opposed to marriage, Paz argues, entering the convent was a socially acceptable way to be a single woman in seventeenth century Mexico.<ref name=":6">{{Cite journal|last1=Paz|first1=Octavio|last2=Marting|first2=Diane|date=October 1979|title=Juana Ramírez|journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|volume=5|issue=1|pages=80–97|doi=10.1086/493685|s2cid=225090644|issn=0097-9740}}</ref> Entering the convent also meant that Sor Juana could read and write about religion despite the barriers to formal education for women. O’Donnell argues that Sor Juana was called a rare bird because although theology was only an acceptable pursuit for men in the [[Catholic Church]], she actively studied religion.<ref name=":0" /> Sor Juana likely perceived wisdom and religion as inseparable, so she probably also believed that to follow God was to pursue wisdom.<ref name=":6" /> Other scholars, like Alicia Gaspar de Alba, offer instead the possibility that Sor Juana was located on the lesbian continuum and that the convent was a place where having relations with other women was socially acceptable.<ref name=":13" /> A fourth perspective suggests that considering the colonial context of New Spain and Sor Juana's background as a ''[[criolla]]'', she represented [[Colonialism|colonial]] knowledge in a way that defied colonial religious structures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sunypress.edu/pdf/63797.pdf|title=Iconic Mexican Women at the Threshold of a New Century|date=2018|access-date=December 7, 2019}}</ref>

Luis Felipe Fabre criticized 'Sorjuanista' scholarship as a whole, arguing that the discourse is binary rather than complex and multilayered.<ref name=":17">{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/books/ct-prj-enigmas-sor-juana-other-monsters-20151223-story.html|title=Reviews: 'Enigmas' and 'Sor Juana and Other Monsters'|last=Rooney|first=Kathleen|website=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2019-12-07}}</ref>

==== Alicia Gaspar de Alba ====
[[Alicia Gaspar de Alba]]'s historical novel, ''Sor Juana's Second Dream'' (1999), rejects Octavio Paz's view that Sor Juana was ambivalent to sexuality, which he portrays as an explanation of her entering the convent.<ref name=":13" /> Instead, Gaspar de Alba interprets Sor Juana as [[Homoeroticism|homoerotic]]. According to Gaspar de Alba, it was Sor Juana's attraction to other women, which was repressed by the "patriarchal and [[Heteronormativity|heteronormative]] society outside of the convent", that led her to become a nun.<ref name=":13" /> She criticizes Paz for his portrayal of what she calls "Sorjuanistas", whom she claims stem from a Mexican, rather than "Indigenous viewpoint", and are "homophobic".<ref name=":13" />

This work won the Latino Literary Hall of Fame Award for Best Historical Novel in 2000. In 2001, it was translated into Spanish and published as ''El Segundo Sueño'' by Grijalbo Mondadori. The novel has also been adapted to a stage play, ''The Nun and the Countess'' by Odalys Nanin; and to a film, ''Juana de Asbaje'', directed by Mexican filmmaker Rene Bueno, with the screenplay co-written by Bueno and Gaspar de Alba and Mexican actress [[Ana de la Reguera]] as the title role. ''Juana,'' an opera based on the novel will be performed by Opera UCLA in November 2019, the music composed by [[Carla Lucero]] and the libretto co-written by Lucero and Gaspar de Alba.

==== Luis Felipe Fabre ====
{{ill|Luis Felipe Fabre|es}}, a Mexican writer and scholar, ridicules other scholars, whom he collectively calls Sorjuanistas, who idolize Sor Juana.<ref name=":17" /> In his book, ''Sor Juana and Other Monsters'', Fabre argues that the appropriation and recontextualization imminent in scholars' interpretations of Sor Juana construct Sor Juana as either a heretic or a lesbian.<ref name=":17" /> Fabre suggests that such representations constitute Sor Juana as a monstrosity or abnormality rather than as a complex woman.<ref name=":17" /> He suggests that rather than locating Sor Juana in a fixed identity, scholarship on Sor Juana should be a fluctuating and multilayered conversation.<ref name=":17" />

==== Margaret Sayers Peden ====
Margaret Sayers Peden's 1982 ''A Woman of Genius: The Intellectual Autobiography of Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz'', was the first English translation of Sor Juana's work.<ref>{{Cite book|id={{ASIN|0915998157|country=ca}}}}</ref> As well, Peden is credited for her 1989 translation of ''Sor Juana: Or, the Traps of Faith''. Unlike other translations, Peden chose to translate the title of Sor Juana's best known work, ''First Dream'', as "First I Dream" instead. Peden's use of first person instills authority in Sor Juana as an author, as a person with knowledge, in a male-dominated society.<ref name=":15">{{Cite book|title=Routledge research companion to the works of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz|others=Bergmann, Emilie L., 1949-, Schlau, Stacey, 1948-|isbn=978-1-317-04164-1|location=London|oclc=985840432|date = 2017-04-28}}</ref> Peden also published her English translations of Sor Juana's work in an anthology called ''Poems, Protest, and a Dream''.

==== Electa Arenal and Amanda Powell ====
An equally valuable feminist analysis and interpretation of Sor Juana's life and work is found in ''The Answer/La Respuesta by Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz'' by Electa Arenal, a Sor Juana scholar who is recognized among [[feminists]] who changed America, and Amanda Powell, a poet and translator.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Answer/LaRespuesta by Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz|last1=Arenal|first1=Electa|last2=Powell|first2=Amanda|date=June 1, 2009|publisher=The Feminist Press|isbn=9781558615984|edition=2nd|location=New York}}</ref> The original publication, released in 1994 by [[The Feminist Press]], was re-released in an updated second edition in 2009, also by [[The Feminist Press]]. The bilingual publication includes poems, an annotated publication of Sor Juana's response to Church officials and her impassioned plea for education of women, analysis and a bibliography. ''The Answer'' applies a valuable gender lens to Sor Juana's writings and life.<ref name=":8">{{cite book|title=The Routledge Research Companion to the Works of Sor Juana Inéz de la Cruz|last1=Bergmann|first1=Emilie L.|last2=Schlau|first2=Stacey|date=2017|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317041641}}</ref> In their feminist analysis, Powell and Arenal translate the viewpoint of Sor Juana's writing as gender-ambiguous.

==== Theresa A. Yugar ====
Theresa A. Yugar, a feminist theologian scholar in her own right, wrote her Master's and Doctoral theses on Sor Juana. Her book, ''Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz: Feminist Reconstruction of Biography and Text,'' discusses the life of Sor Juana through a feminist lens and analysis of her texts, ''La Respuesta'' (The Answer) and ''El Primero Sueño'' (First Dream).<ref name=":9">{{Cite web|url=https://feminismandreligion.com/2017/04/17/remembering-sor-juana-ines-de-la-cruzs-life-and-legacy-champion-of-universal-and-non-human-rights-november-12-164851-april-17-1695-by-theresa-a-yugar/|title=Remembering Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz's Life and Legacy: Champion of Universal, and Non-Human Rights November 12, 1648/51 – April 17, 1695 by Theresa A. Yugar}}</ref>

Yugar aims to understand why individuals in Mexico in the twenty-first century have more knowledge of Frida Kahlo than Sor Juana.<ref name=":9" /> She celebrates poet Octavio Paz for crossing national borders with his internationally acclaimed work on ''Sor Juana: Or, The Traps of Faith''. However, while Paz establishes Sor Juana's historical relevance, Yugar expands on his work to establish Sor Juana's importance in the twenty-first century.<ref name=":9" />

Yugar argues that Sor Juana is the first female bibliophile in the New World. She also argues that Sor Juana's historic focus on gender and class equality in education (the [[public sphere]]) and the household (the [[private sphere]]), in addition to her advocacy for language rights, and the connection between indigenous religious traditions and ecological protection were paramount in the seventeenth century. Today's similar advocacy ignores her primal position in that work which is currently exclusively associated with [[ecofeminism]] and [[feminist theology]].<ref name=":9" />

== Historical influence ==

=== Philanthropy ===
[[File:Fama y obras póstumas del Fénix de México.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The first part of Sor Juana's complete works, Madrid, 1689.]]
The Sor Juana Inés Services for Abused Women<ref name=":12">{{Cite web|url=https://www.corasupport.org/about/our-story/|title=Our Story|website=CORA|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-06}}</ref> was established in 1993 to pay Sor Juana's dedication to helping women survivors of domestic violence forward. Renamed the Community Overcoming Relationship Abuse (CORA), the organization offers community, legal, and family support services in Spanish to Latin American women and children who have faced or are facing domestic violence.<ref name=":12" />

=== Education ===
The San Jerónimo Convent, where Juana lived the last 27 years of her life and where she wrote most of her work is today the [[University of the Cloister of Sor Juana]] in the [[historic center of Mexico City]]. The Mexican government founded in the university in 1979.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cdmxtravel.com/en/attractions/claustro-de-sor-juana-university-siste-museum.html|title=Claustro de Sor Juana University Siste Museum · Attractions|last=CDMX|first=Secretaría de Turismo de|website=cdmxtravel.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-05}}</ref>

=== Political Controversy ===
While Sor Juana was a famous and controversial figure in the seventeenth century, she is also an important figure in modern times.

During renovations at the cloister in the 1970s, bones believed to be those of Sor Juana were discovered. A medallion similar to the one depicted in portraits of Juana was also found. [[Margarita López Portillo]], the sister of President [[José López Portillo]] (1976-1982), kept the medallion. During the tercentennial of Sor Juana's death in 1995, a member of the Mexican congress called on Margarita López Portillo to return the medallion, which she said she had taken for safekeeping. She returned it to Congress on November 14, 1995, with the event and description of the controversy reported in ''[[The New York Times]]'' a month later. Whether or not the medallion belonged to Juana, the incident sparked discussions about Juana and abuse of official power in Mexico.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/15/world/mexico-city-journal-the-poet-s-medallion-a-case-of-finders-keepers.html|title=Mexico City Journal;The Poet's Medallion: A Case of Finders Keepers?|last=Depalma|first=Anthony|date=1995-12-15|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=2016-04-15|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

=== Contribution to feminism ===

==== Historic feminist movements ====
Amanda Powell locates Sor Juana as a contributor to the [[Querelle des femmes|Querelles des Femmes]], a three-century long literary debate about women.<ref name=":14">{{Cite journal|last=Powell|first=Amanda|date=2009|title=Revisiting the "Querelle" in María de San José Salazar and Juana Inés de la Cruz: Inciting Disturbances of Patriarchy|journal=Letras Femeninas|volume=35|issue=1|pages=211–232|issn=0277-4356|jstor=23023069}}</ref> Central to this early feminist debate were ideas about [[gender]] and [[sex]], and, consequently, [[misogyny]].<ref name=":14" />

Powell argues that the formal and informal networks and pro-feminist ideas of the Querelles des Femmes were important influences on Sor Juana's work, La Respuesta.<ref name=":14" /> For women, Powell argues, engaging in conversation with other women was as significant as communicating through writing.<ref name=":14" /> However, while [[Teresa of Ávila]] appears in Sor Juana's ''La Respuesta'', Sor Juana makes no mention of the person who launched the debate, [[Christine de Pizan]].<ref name=":14" /> Rather than focusing on Sor Juana's engagement with other literary works, Powell prioritizes Sor Juana's position of authority in her own literary discourse. This authoritative stance not only demonstrates a direct counter to misogyny, but was also typically reserved for men.<ref name=":14" /> As well, Sor Juana's argument that ideas about women in religious hierarchies are culturally constructed, not divine, echoes ideas about the construction of gender and sex.<ref name=":14" />

==== Modern feminist movements ====
Yugar connects Sor Juana to [[Feminist movements and ideologies|feminist advocacy]] movements in the twenty-first century, such as [[religious feminism]], [[ecofeminism]], and the [[feminist movement]] in general.

Although the current religious feminist movement grew out of the [[Liberation theology|Liberation Theology]] movement of the 1970s,<ref name=":11">{{Cite web|url=https://www.the-exponent.com/latina-feminist-theology-with-theresa-a-yugar/|title=Latina Feminist Theology with Theresa A. Yugar|last=Bennett|first=April Young|date=2018-09-10|website=The Exponent|language=en|access-date=2019-12-06}}</ref> Yugar uses Sor Juana's criticism of religious law that permits only men to occupy leadership positions within the Church as early evidence of her religious feminism. Based on Sor Juana's critique of the oppressive and [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] structures of the Church of her day,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sor Juana Ines De La Cruz: Feminist Reconstruction of Biography and Text|last=Yugar|first=Theresa A.|publisher=Wipf and Stock|year=2014|isbn=978-1-62564-440-4|location=Eugene, OR}}</ref> Yugar argues that Sor Juana predated current movements, like Latina Feminist Theology, that privilege Latina women's views on religion.<ref name=":11" /> She also cites modern movements such as the Roman Catholic Women Priest Movement, the Women's Ordination Conference, and the Women's Alliance for Theology, Ethics and Ritual, all of which also speak out against the [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] limitations on women in religious institutions.<ref name=":11" />

Yugar emphasizes that Sor Juana interpreted the Bible as expressing concern with people of all backgrounds as well as with the earth.<ref name=":9" /> Most significantly, Yugar argues, Sor Juana expressed concern over the consequences of [[Capitalism|capitalistic]] Spanish domination over the earth. These ideas, Yugar points out, are commonly associated with modern [[Feminism|feminist]] movements concerned with [[decolonization]]<ref name=":11" /> and the protection of the planet.<ref name=":9" />

Alicia Gaspar de Alba connects Sor Juana to the modern [[lesbian movement]] and [[Chicano Movement|Chicana movement.]] She links Sor Juana to criticizing the concepts of [[compulsory heterosexuality]] and advocating the idea of a lesbian continuum, both of which are credited to well-known feminist writer and advocate [[Adrienne Rich]].<ref name=":13" /> As well, Gaspar de Alba locates Sor Juana in the Chicana movement, which has not been accepting of "Indigenous lesbians".<ref name=":13" />

=== A symbol ===

==== Colonial and indigenous identities ====
As a woman in religion, Sor Juana has become associated with the [[Our Lady of Guadalupe|Virgin of Guadalupe]], a religious symbol of Mexican identity, but was also connected to Aztec goddesses.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hind|first=Emily|date=2006|title=Being Jean Franco: Mastering Reading and "Plotting Women"|journal=Letras Femeninas|volume=32|issue=1|pages=329–350|issn=0277-4356|jstor=23024128}}</ref> For example, parts of Sor Juana's ''Villancico 224'' are written in Nahuatl, while others are written in Spanish.<ref name=":16" /> The Virgin of Guadalupe is the subject of the ''Villancico'', but depending on the language, the poem refers to both the Virgin of Guadalupe and [[Cihuacōātl|Cihuacoatl]], an Indigneous goddess.<ref name=":16" /> It is ambiguous whether Sor Juana prioritizes the Mexican or indigenous religious figure, or whether her focus is on harmonizing the two.<ref name=":16" />

Sor Juana's connection to indigenous religious figures is also prominent in her ''[[Loa to Divine Narcissus]]'', (Spanish "''El Divino Narciso''") (see Jauregui [https://www.academia.edu/6991029/_El_plato_más_sabroso_eucarist%C3%ADa_plagio_diabólico_y_la_traducción_criolla_del_can%C3%ADbal 2003], [https://www.academia.edu/11767784/_Cannibalism_the_Eucharist_and_Criollo_Subjects_ 2009]). The play centers on the interaction between two Indigenous people, named Occident and America, and two Spanish people, named Religion and Zeal.<ref name=":16" /> The characters exchange their religious perspectives, and conclude that there are more similarities between their religious traditions than there are differences.<ref name=":16" /> The loa references Aztec rituals and gods, including [[Huītzilōpōchtli|Huitzilopochtli]], who symbolized the land of Mexico.<ref name=":16" />

Scholars like Nicole Gomez argue that Sor Juana's fusion of Spanish and Aztec religious traditions in her ''Loa'' ''to Divine Narcissus'' aims to raise the status of indigenous religious traditions to that of Catholicism in New Spain.<ref name=":16" /> Gomez argues that Sor Juana also emphasizes the violence with which Spanish religious traditions dominated indigenous ones.<ref name=":16" /> Ultimately, Gomez argues that Sor Juana's use of both colonial and indigenous languages, symbols, and religious traditions not only gives voice to indigenous peoples, who were marginalized, but also affirms her own indigenous identity.<ref name=":16" />

Through their scholarly interpretations of Sor Juana's work, Octavio Paz and Alicia Gaspar de Alba have also incorporated Sor Juana into discourses about Mexican identity. Paz's accredited scholarship on Sor Juana elevated her to a national symbol as a Mexican woman, writer, and religious authority.<ref name=":13" /> On the contrary, Gaspar de Alba emphasized Sor Juana's indigenous identity by inserting her into Chicana discourses.<ref name=":13" />

==== Connection to Frida Kahlo ====
Paul Allatson emphasizes that women like Sor Juana and Frida Kahlo masculinized their appearances to symbolically complicate the space marked for women in society.<ref name=":13" /> Sor Juana's decision to cut her hair as punishment for mistakes she made during learning<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://msmagazine.com/2011/03/16/my-favorite-feminist-sor-juana-ines-de-la-cruz/|title=My Favorite Feminist: Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz – Ms. Magazine|website=msmagazine.com|access-date=2019-12-07}}</ref> signified her own autonomy, but was also a way to engage in the masculinity expected of male-dominated spaces, like universities. According to Paul Allatson, nuns were also required to cut their hair after entering the convent.<ref name=":13">{{Cite journal|last=Allatson|first=Paul|date=2004|title=A Shadowy Sequence: Chicana Textual/Sexual Reinventions of Sor Juana|journal=Chasqui|language=en|volume=33|issue=1|pages=3–27|doi=10.2307/29741841|jstor=29741841}}</ref> These ideas, Allatson suggests, are echoed in [[Frida Kahlo]]'s 1940 self-portrait titled ''Self-Portrait with Cropped Hair'', or ''Autorretrato con cabellos corto''.<ref name=":13" />

As well, the [[University of the Cloister of Sor Juana]] honored both Frida Kahlo and Sor Juana on October 31, 2018 with a symbolic altar. The altar, called ''Las Dos Juanas'', was specially made for the [[Day of the Dead]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/cultura/frida-kahlo-y-sor-juana-juntas-en-monumental-altar-de-muertos|title=Frida Kahlo y Sor Juana, juntas en monumental altar de muertos|date=2018-10-23|website=El Universal|language=es|access-date=2019-12-07}}</ref>

====Official recognition by the Mexican government====
In present times, Sor Juana is still an important figure in Mexico.

In 1995, Sor Juana's name was inscribed in gold on the wall of honor in the [[Congress of the Union|Mexican Congress]] in April 1995.<ref name=":2" /> In addition, Sor Juana is pictured on the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]] of the 200 pesos bill issued by the [[Bank of Mexico|Banco de Mexico]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.banxico.org.mx/billetes-y-monedas/informacion-general/billetes-y-monedas-de-fabricacion-actual/billete-de-200-pesos/pagina-billete-200-pesos.html|publisher=[[Bank of Mexico]]|title=Billete de 200 pesos|access-date=2011-07-26|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907072707/http://www.banxico.org.mx/billetes-y-monedas/informacion-general/billetes-y-monedas-de-fabricacion-actual/billete-de-200-pesos/pagina-billete-200-pesos.html|archive-date=2011-09-07}}</ref> and the 1000 pesos coin minted by Mexico between 1988 and 1992. The town where Sor Juana grew up, San Miguel Nepantla in the municipality of [[Tepetlixpa]], [[State of Mexico]], was renamed in her honor as Nepantla de Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz.
