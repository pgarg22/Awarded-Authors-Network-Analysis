Later he was an instructor at [[Sarah Lawrence]] and [[Princeton University]], poetry editor of [[The New Republic]].

He was a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], and a Chancellor of the [[Academy of American Poets]]. From 1984 to 1985 he was appointed Consultant in Poetry to the [[Library of Congress]], a position now known as [[Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry]], the United States' equivalent of a national poet laureate, but did not serve due to illness.

Fitzgerald is widely known as one of the most poetic translators into the English language. He also served as literary executor to [[Flannery O'Connor]], who was a boarder at his home in [[Redding, Connecticut]], from 1949 to 1951. <!-- Various sources incorrectly cite Ridgefield, Connecticut, as Fitzgerald's home from the 1940s into the 1960s. He, in fact, lived on Seventy Acres Road in adjacent Redding, Connecticut. He and Flannery O'Connor used a Ridgefield mailing address because, in those days, rural delivery to that portion of Redding was done by the Ridgefield post office. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} --> Fitzgerald's wife at the time, Sally Fitzgerald, compiled O'Connor's essays and letters after O'Connor's death. [[Benedict Fitzgerald]] (who co-wrote the screenplay for ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' with [[Mel Gibson]]), Barnaby Fitzgerald, and Michael Fitzgerald are sons of Robert and Sally.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Robert-Fitzgerald|title=Robert Fitzgerald - American poet|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=February 1, 2019}}</ref>

Fitzgerald was married three times. He later moved to [[Hamden, Connecticut]], where he died at his home after a long illness.<ref name="nytobit"/>
