'''Phillippa Yaa de Villiers''' (born 17 February 1966)<ref name=lyrikline>[http://www.lyrikline.org/en/poems/eating-two-5933#.VG25XPmsV7s Phillippa Yaa de Villiers biography] at Lyrikline.</ref> is a [[South Africa]]n writer and performance artist who performs her work nationally and internationally. She is noted for her poetry, which has been published in collections and in many magazines and anthologies, as well as for her autobiographical one-woman show, ''Original Skin'', which centres on her confusion about her identity at a young age, as the [[bi-racial]] daughter of an [[Australian]] mother and a [[Ghana]]ian father who was adopted and raised by a white family in [[apartheid]] South Africa.<ref>[http://www.african-writing.com/hol/profiles.htm "Profiles – 8 South African Women Writers"], African Writing Online, December/January 2008.</ref> She has written: "I became Phillippa Yaa when I found my biological father, who told me that if he had been there when I was born, the first name I'd have been given would be a [[Akan names|day name]] like all Ghanaian babies, and all Thursday girls are Yaa, Yawo, or Yaya. So by changing my name I intended to inscribe a feeling of belonging and also one of pride on my African side. After growing up black in white South Africa, internalising so many negative 'truths' of what black people are like, I needed to reclaim my humanity and myself from the toxic dance of objectification."<ref>[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/article/20141108104945-107515232-thoughts-behind-indegenius-concept-for-the-29th "Thoughts behind Indegenius: concept for the 29th"], Pulse, 8 November 2014.</ref> She has also said: "Because I wasn't told that I was adopted until I was twenty, I lacked a vocabulary to describe who I am and where I come from, so performing and writing became ways to make myself up."<ref>MarLa Sink Druzgal, [http://travelingmarla.com/2015/09/30/around-the-world-with-the-poetry-of-phillippa-yaa-de-villiers/ "Around the World with the Poetry of Phillippa Yaa de Villiers"], Traveling Marla.</ref> As [[Tishani Doshi]] observes in the ''[[New Indian Express]]'': "Much of her work is concerned with race, sexuality, class and gender within the South African context."<ref name=Doshi>Tishani Doshi, [http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/books/Poetry-Beyond-the-Edge-of-Time/2014/10/04/article2460400.ece "Poetry Beyond the Edge of Time"], ''The New Indian Express'', 4 October 2014.</ref>

==Biography==
===Adoption and childhood years===
De Villiers was born at [[Hillbrow]] in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa,<ref name=PoetryArchive>[http://www.poetryarchive.org/poet/phillippa-yaa-de-villiers "About Phillippa Yaa de Villiers"], The Poetry Archive.</ref> where she spent the first months of her life in The Princess Alice Home, a facility for adopted babies. Half-Australian and half-Ghanaian,<ref name=Doshi /> she was adopted at nine months of age, although not told of it by her white adoptive parents until she was 20 years old.<ref name=PoetsOnAdoption>[http://poetsonadoption.blogspot.co.uk/2011/04/phillippa-yaa-de-villiers.html "Poets on Adoption"], 11 April 2011.</ref> She has written about the impact of these experiences:
<blockquote>"I started writing poetry when I was a child, my first published poem was when I was 11. I was brought up in a home that loved poetry and literature, especially the English language. But it was only when I was older that I realised that writing is so much more than words playing on a page. Writing contains the writer, their concerns, their social context and their history. My own history became a block to my creativity as I started to explore my identity as a black woman adopted by a white family in apartheid South Africa. I felt like the colonised and the coloniser were fighting each other inside my brain. Writing continued to be important to me but I was convinced that it was simply a therapeutic process, of no value to anyone else.
Although their relationship was tempestuous and marked by long separations, de Villiers credits her adoptive mother Hertha Lilly Amalia nee Graf, an eminent physical anthropologist,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cashp.columbian.gwu.edu/woman-science|title=A Woman in Science &#124; Center for the Advanced Study of Human Paleobiology &#124; the George Washington University}}</ref> with the love of poetry as well as believing in her talent as a performer. The story of their relationship, and a broader exposition of Yaa's complex racial identity, appears in ''Darwin's Hunch'',<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Darwins-Hunch-Science-Search-Origins/dp/1431424250 ''Darwin's Hunch: Science, Race and the Search for Human Origins''.]</ref> Christa Kuljian's expansive exploration of race and science. 
As a [[mixed-race]] African and adoptee I feel, paradoxically, oppressed and completely free....My adult life has been largely devoted to healing this rift. The freedom of my paradoxical position, is in fact that I don't have the constraints of a traditional role and I have access to the world."<ref name=CrossingBorders3 /></blockquote>

===Further education and early career===
She studied for a journalism degree at [[Rhodes University]], [[Grahamstown]],<ref name=JoziBF>[http://jozibookfair.org.za/2FhighJB28/JBlow28f2/profiles.htm Biographical note, Jozi Book Fair 2009.]</ref><ref>[http://writersinresidence.passaporta.be/index.php?q=residences/en/archive/236#bio Phillippa Yaa de Villiers page] at Passa Porta, International House of Literature in [[Brussels]].</ref> and also obtained an Honours degree in Dramatic Art and Scriptwriting from the [[University of the Witwatersrand]].<ref name=JoziBF /> She is a graduate of the [[L'École Internationale de Théâtre Jacques Lecoq|Lecoq International School of Theatre]] in [[Paris]], [[France]], where she studied mime and theatre.<ref>[http://badilishapoetry.com/artists-profile/22/ Biography at Badilisha Poetry.]</ref><ref name=CCA>[http://www.cca.ukzn.ac.za/index.php/pa-past-participants/61-pa-2007/849-phillippa-yaa-de-villiers-south-africa Biography at Centre for Creative Arts (CCA)], University of Kwazulu-Natal.</ref> She then spent some time living in [[Los Angeles]]<ref name=lyrikline /> before returning to South Africa in 1998 to settle in [[Johannesburg]].<ref name=PoetryArchive /> She worked as an actor for two years, performing in Theatre for Africa's award-winning productions of ''Kwamanzi'', ''Horn of Sorrow'' and ''Elephant of Africa'', "and then [[Bell's palsy]] sent her towards writing as an alternative career.
