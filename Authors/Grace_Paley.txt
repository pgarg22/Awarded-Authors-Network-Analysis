'''Grace Paley''' (December 11, 1922 – August 22, 2007) was an American [[short story]] author, [[poet]], teacher, and [[political activist]].

Paley wrote three critically acclaimed collections of short stories, which were compiled in the [[Pulitzer Prize]] and [[National Book Award for Fiction|National Book Award]] finalist ''[[The Collected Stories of Grace Paley|The Collected Stories]]'' in 1994.<ref name=":7">{{Cite web|title=The Collected Stories|url=https://www.nationalbook.org/books/the-collected-stories-2/|access-date=2020-09-03|website=National Book Foundation|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name="FoxNYTobit20070823">{{cite journal|author=Fox, Margalit|date=August 23, 2007|title=Grace Paley, Writer and Activist, Dies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/23/books/23cnd-paley.html|journal=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=March 6, 2020}}</ref> Her stories hone in on the everyday conflicts and heartbreaks of city life, heavily informed by her childhood in the [[The Bronx|Bronx]].<ref name=":8" />

==Early life and education==
Grace Paley was born Grace Goodside on December 11, 1922, in the [[Bronx]], to Jewish parents, Isaac Goodside and the former Manya Ridnyik, who were originally from [[Ukraine]], and were socialists—especially her mother.<ref name = FoxNYTobit20070823/><ref name = DeeJonesMacFarquarParisRev1992>{{cite journal | author = Dee, Jonathan; Jones, Barbara; [[Larissa MacFarquhar|MacFarquhar, Larissa]] & Paley, Grace  | date = Fall 1992 | title = Grace Paley, The Art of Fiction No. 131 | journal = [[The Paris Review]] | volume = 124 | url = http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2028/the-art-of-fiction-no-131-grace-paley | access-date = March 6, 2020}}</ref> They had immigrated 16–17 years before (in 1906, by one account<ref name = FoxNYTobit20070823/>)<ref name = DeeJonesMacFarquarParisRev1992/>—following a period, under the rule of the Ukraine by Czar Nicholas II, that saw their exile, her mother to Germany and her father to Siberia—with the change of name from ''Gutseit'' as they began their new life in New York.<ref name = FoxNYTobit20070823/>

The family spoke [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Yiddish]] in the home, and eventually [[English language|English]] (which her father learned "by reading Dickens").<ref name = DeeJonesMacFarquarParisRev1992/> Isaac trained and became a doctor in New York, and the couple had two children early, and a third, Grace, as they approached middle age.<ref name = FoxNYTobit20070823/> Fourteen years younger than her sister, Jeanne, and sixteen years younger than her brother, Victor, Grace was described as being a [[tomboy]] as a child.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Arcana|first=Judith|date=1989|title=Grace Paley: Life and Stories|url=https://ecommons.luc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3632&context=luc_diss|journal=Loyola University Chicago}}</ref> As a child she was tuned in to the intellectual debates of the adults around her, and she was a member of the [[Red Falcons|Falcons]], a socialist youth group.<ref name=":1" />

==Writing==
Early in her writing career, Paley experienced a number of rejections for her submitted works.<ref name=":1" /> She published her first collection, ''The Little Disturbances of Man'' (1959) with [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]].<ref name="FoxNYTobit20070823" /> The collection features eleven stories of New York life, several of which have since been widely anthologized, particularly "Goodbye and Good Luck" and "The Used-Boy Raisers," and introduces the semi-autobiographical character "Faith Darwin" (in "The Used-Boy Raisers" and "A Subject of Childhood")—who later appears in six stories of ''Enormous Changes at the Last Minute'' and nine of ''Later the Same Day''.<ref name=":4">{{Cite book|last=Paley, Grace.|title=The collected stories|date=1994|publisher=Farrar Straus Giroux|isbn=0-374-12636-4|edition=1st|location=New York|oclc=29389536}}</ref><ref name=":1" /><ref name=":5">{{Cite news|last=Skolkin-Smith|first=Leora|date=2011-06-06|title=The "Legacy" of Grace Paley|work=Quartery Conversation|url=http://quarterlyconversation.com/the-legacy-of-grace-paley|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191023225037/http://quarterlyconversation.com/the-legacy-of-grace-paley|archive-date=2019-10-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Harris|first=Robert R.|date=1985-04-14|title=Pacifists With Their Dukes Up|url=https://movies2.nytimes.com/books/98/04/19/specials/paley-later.html|access-date=2020-09-03|website=New York Times}}</ref> Though as a story collection by an unknown author the book was not widely reviewed, those who did review it, including [[Philip Roth]] and ''[[The New Yorker]]'' book page, tended to rate the stories highly.<ref name=":5" /> Despite an initial lack of publicity, ''Little Disturbances'' developed a sufficient following for it to be reissued by [[Viking Press]] in 1968.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Paley, Grace.|title=Conversations with Grace Paley|date=1997|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|others=Bach, Gerhard, 1943-, Hall, Blaine H.|isbn=0-87805-961-X|location=Jackson, Miss.|oclc=35758293}}</ref>

Following the success of ''Little Disturbances'', Paley's publisher encouraged her to write a [[novel]], but she gave up on the attempt after tinkering with drafts for two years. She instead continued to focus on short stories.<ref name=":3" />

With the encouragement of her friend and neighbor [[Donald Barthelme]],<ref name=":1" /><ref name="DeeJonesMacFarquarParisRev1992" /> Paley assembled a second collection of fiction in 1974, ''Enormous Changes at the Last Minute'', which was published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux.<ref name="FoxNYTobit20070823" /> This collection of seventeen stories features several recurring characters from ''Little Disturbances'' (most notably the narrator "Faith," but also including John Raftery and his mother), while continuing Paley's exploration of [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]], [[gender]], and [[social class|class]] issues.<ref name=":4" /> The long story "Faith in a Tree," positioned roughly at the center of the collection, brings a number of characters and themes from the stories together on a Saturday afternoon at the park; in it, Faith, the narrator, climbs a tree to get a broader perspective on both her neighbors and the "man-wide world" and, after encountering several war protesters, declares a new social and political commitment.<ref name=":4" /> The collection's shifting [[Narrator|narrative voice]], [[metafiction|metafictive]] qualities and fragmented, incomplete [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]s have led some critics to classify it as a [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]] work.<ref name="FoxNYTobit20070823" /><ref>{{Cite web|last=Klinkowitz|first=Jerome|date=2017-07-26|title=Metafiction|url=https://oxfordre.com/literature/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190201098.001.0001/acrefore-9780190201098-e-546?product=orelit|access-date=2020-09-03|website=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Literature|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190201098.013.546|isbn=9780190201098}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Pohl|first=R.

In ''Later the Same Day'' (1985), also published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux,<ref name="FoxNYTobit20070823" /> Paley continues the stories of Faith and her neighbors—but somewhat expanded, with the addition of more black and lesbian voices.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":10">{{Cite web|title=May 2007 {{!}} The Amazing Grace Paley|url=https://www.vermontwoman.com/articles/2007/0507/GracePaley.html|access-date=2020-09-03|website=www.vermontwoman.com}}</ref>

Paley's stories were regathered in a volume from Farrar, Straus in 1994, [[The Collected Stories of Grace Paley|''The Collected Stories'']], which was a finalist for the [[Pulitzer Prize]] and the [[National Book Award]].<ref name="FoxNYTobit20070823" />

Her work has been characterized as dealing with the day-to-day triumphs and tragedies of "women — mostly Jewish, mostly New Yorkers."<ref name="FoxNYTobit20070823" /> As one editor who worked with Paley wrote, "Her characters are people who smell of onions, yell at each other, mourn in darkened kitchens."<ref name=":11">{{Cite web|last1=August 27|last2=Arts|first2=2007 {{!}} Robin Morgan {{!}}|last3=culture|title=L'Chaim!

Although more widely known for her short fiction, Paley also published several volumes of poetry including ''Leaning Forward'' (1985)<ref>{{Cite book|last=Paley, Grace.|title=Leaning forward : poems|date=1985|publisher=Granite Press|isbn=0-9614886-0-3|location=Penobscot, Me.|oclc=12813576}}</ref> and ''New and Collected Poems'' (1992).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Paley|first=Grace|title=New and collected poems|date=1992|publisher=Tilbury House|isbn=0-88448-098-4|location=Gardiner, Me.|oclc=25025254}}</ref> In 1991 she published ''Long Walks and Intimate Talks'', which combined poems and prose writing,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Long Walks and Intimate Talks: Stories, Poems and Paintings|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-55861-043-9|access-date=2020-09-03|website=Publisher's Weekly}}</ref> and in 2001 she released the collection ''Begin Again: Collected Poems'', which assembled work from throughout her life.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Poets|first=Academy of American|title=About Grace Paley {{!}} Academy of American Poets|url=https://poets.org/poet/grace-paley|access-date=2020-09-03|website=poets.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Paley, Grace.|title=Begin again : collected poems|date=2001|publisher=Farrar, Straus & Giroux|isbn=0-374-52724-5|edition=1st pbk.|location=New York|oclc=46388814}}</ref>

Her final book, the poetry collection ''Fidelity'', was published posthumously in 2008.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Salter|first=Mary Jo|date=2008-04-06|title=At the Last Minute|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/06/books/review/Salter2-t.html|access-date=2020-09-03|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

==Academic career==
Paley began to teach writing at [[Sarah Lawrence College]] in 1966 (through to 1989)<ref>{{Cite web|title=Our Grace|url=https://www.sarahlawrence.edu/magazine/hardway/alumni/grace.html|access-date=2020-09-03|website=www.sarahlawrence.edu|language=en}}</ref> and helped to found the [[Teachers & Writers Collaborative]] in New York in the late 1960s.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|date=2018-03-13|title=Imagining the Present|url=https://teachersandwritersmagazine.org/imagining-the-present-4731.htm|access-date=2020-09-03|website=Teachers & Writers Magazine|language=en-US}}</ref> She subsequently served on the faculty at [[City College of New York|City College]] and taught courses at [[Columbia University]].<ref name="DeeJonesMacFarquarParisRev1992" /> She also taught at [[Syracuse University]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=Grace Paley|url=https://www.albany.edu/writers-inst/webpages4/archives/paley.html|access-date=2020-09-03|website=www.albany.edu}}</ref> and served as vice president of the [[PEN America|PEN American Center]],<ref name="FoxNYTobit20070823" /> an organization she'd worked to diversify in the 1980s.<ref name=":10" /> Paley summarized her view of teaching during a symposium on "Educating the Imagination," sponsored by the Teachers & Writers Collaborative in 1996:<blockquote>"Our idea was that children—by writing, by putting down words, by reading, by beginning to love literature, by the inventiveness of listening to one another—could begin to understand the world better and begin to make a better world for themselves. That always seemed to me such a natural idea that I’ve never understood why it took so much aggressiveness and so much time to get it started."<ref name=":2" /></blockquote>

==Political activism==
Paley was known for [[pacifism]] and for political activism.<ref name="FoxNYTobit20070823" /> Her fellow feminist activist Robin Morgan described Paley's activism as broadly focused on social justice: "civil-rights, anti-war, anti-nuclear, feminist, whatever needed revolution."<ref name=":11" /> The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] declared her a [[Communism|communist]] and kept a file on her for thirty years.<ref name=":1" />

== Personal life and final years ==
Though Paley's [[Jews|Jewish]] background was a vital part of her identity and work, and she found community in her local synagogue in Vermont in her later years,<ref name=":9" /> she was raised agnostic, with her father refusing to go to temple entirely.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":1" /> She described herself as a bigger believer in the [[Jewish diaspora]] than in Jewish nationhood, emphasizing: "I was never a [[Zionism|Zionist]]."<ref name=":3" />
