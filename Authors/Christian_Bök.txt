'''Christian Bök'''{{Needs IPA}}[[Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada|, FRSC]], (born August 10, 1966 in [[Toronto]], Canada) is an [[avant-garde|experimental]] [[Canadian poetry|Canadian poet]]. He is the author of ''Eunoia'', which won the Canadian [[Griffin Poetry Prize]].

==Life and work==
He was born "Christian Book", but uses "Bök" as a pseudonym.

He began writing seriously in his early twenties, while earning his B.A. and M.A. degrees at [[Carleton University]] in [[Ottawa]]. He returned to Toronto in the early 1990s to study for a Ph.D. in English literature at [[York University]], where he encountered a burgeoning literary community that included [[Steve McCaffery]], [[Christopher Dewdney]], and [[Darren Wershler-Henry]]. {{As of|2005}} he teaches at the [[University of Calgary]].<ref>[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2007/07/the-xenotext-experiment-an-interview-with-christian-bok/ The Xenotext Experiment: An Interview with Christian Bök]</ref>

In 1994, Bök published ''[[Crystallography (book)|Crystallography]]'', "a [[pataphysical]] encyclopaedia that misreads the language of [[poetics]] through the conceits of [[geology]]." The ''Village Voice'' said of it: "Bök's concise reflections on mirrors, [[fractal]]s, stones, and ice diabolically change the way you think about language — his, yours — so that what begins as description suddenly seems indistinguishable from the thing itself."<ref name=voice>Ed Park, "[http://www.villagevoice.com/2003-12-16/books/crystal-method/ Crystal Method]," ''Village Voice'', Dec. 16, 2003.</ref> ''Crystallography'' was reissued in 2003,<ref name=voice/> and was nominated for a [[Gerald Lampert Award]].

Bök is a [[sound poet]] and has performed an extremely condensed version of the "Ursonate" by [[Kurt Schwitters]]. He has created [[conceptual art]], making [[artist's book]]s from [[Rubik's Cube]]s and [[Lego]] bricks. He has also worked in science-fiction television by constructing [[artistic language]]s for [[Gene Roddenberry]]'s ''[[Earth: Final Conflict]]'' and [[Peter Benchley]]'s ''[[Amazon (1999 TV series)|Amazon]]''.

===Eunoia===
Bök is most famous for ''[[Eunoia (book)|Eunoia]]'' (2001), a book which took him seven years to write.<ref name=voice/> ''Eunoia'' consists of [[univocalic]]s: The book uses only one vowel in each of its five chapters. In the book's main part, each chapter used just a single vowel, producing sentences such as this: "Enfettered, these sentences repress free speech."<ref>{{cite web |last=Shelburne |first=Curtis K. |url=http://www.cnjonline.com/articles/love_30557___article.html/writes_one.html |title=God writes his love in one word &#124; love, writes, one - Faith and Lifestyles - Clovis News Journal |publisher=Cnjonline.com |date=2008-10-16 |accessdate=2012-01-14 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120724100916/http://www.cnjonline.com/articles/love_30557___article.html/writes_one.html |archive-date=2012-07-24 }}</ref> Bök believes "his book proves that each vowel has its own personality, and demonstrates the flexibility of the English language."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_7697000/7697762.stm |title=BBC - Today |work=BBC News |date=2008-10-30 |accessdate=2012-01-14}}</ref>

Edited by Darren Wershler-Henry and published by [[Coach House Books]],
in 2001, ''Eunoia'' won the 2002 Griffin and sold 20,000 copies.<ref name=bestseller>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/calgary-poet-hits-u-k-bestseller-list-1.850516|title=Calgary poet hits U.K. bestseller list|publisher=cbc.ca|accessdate=2009-01-05| date=2009-01-05}}</ref> [[Canongate Books|Canongate]] published "Eunoia" in Britain in Oct. 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2008/10/29/boll129.xml |title=Literary Life |work=Telegraph |accessdate=2012-01-14}}{{dead link|date=July 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The book was also a bestseller there, reaching #8 on the Top 10 bestselling charts for the year.<ref name=bestseller/>

===The Xenotext experiment===
On April 4, 2011 Bök announced a significant break-through in his 9-year project to engineer "a life-form so that it becomes not only a durable archive for storing a poem, but also an operant machine for writing a poem".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbk.ac.uk/cprc/news/Bok_at_BBK |title=Contemporary Poetics Research Centre: Christian Bök - 'The Xenotext: A Progress Report' (Thursday 5 May 2011) |publisher=Bbk.ac.uk |accessdate=2012-01-14 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210033044/http://www.bbk.ac.uk/cprc/news/Bok_at_BBK |archive-date=10 February 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.law.ed.ac.uk/ahrc/script-ed/vol5-2/editorial.asp |title=The Xenotext Experiment |publisher=Law.ed.ac.uk |accessdate=2012-01-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101053132/http://www.law.ed.ac.uk/ahrc/script-ed/vol5-2/editorial.asp |archive-date=2012-01-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref> On the previous day (April 3) Bök said he

The project has continued for over fifteen years at a cost exceeding $110,000 and he hopes to finish the project in 2014.<ref>https://calgaryherald.com/touch/story.html?id=7874911{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> He published "Book I" of the resulting ''Xenotext'' in 2015.

==Recognition==
''Eunoia'' won the [[Griffin Poetry Prize]] in 2002.<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/art/Griffin-Poetry-Prize Griffin Prize and Winners] Britannica, 2017, Retrieved 16/04/18</ref>

Bök's poem "Vowels" was used in the lyrics of a song on the EP ''A Quick Fix of Melancholy'' (2003) by the Norwegian band [[Ulver]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In 2006, Christian Bök and his work were the subject of an episode of the television series ''[[Heart of a Poet]]'', produced by Canadian filmmaker [[Maureen Judge]].<ref>[http://heartofapoet.ca/episodes.html#NAME Heart of a Poet: Season 1] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213030603/http://heartofapoet.ca/episodes.html#NAME |date=February 13, 2010 }}</ref>

On May 31, 2011, The [[BBC World Service]] broadcast Bök reading "The Xenotext."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p00gvpkk/The_Strand_31_05_2011/ |title=BBC iPlayer - The Strand: 31/05/2011 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2012-01-14}}</ref>
