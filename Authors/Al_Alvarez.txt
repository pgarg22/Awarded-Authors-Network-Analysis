'''Alfred Alvarez''' (5 August 1929 â€“ 23 September 2019) was an English poet, novelist, essayist and critic who published under the name '''A. Alvarez''' and '''Al Alvarez'''.

==Background==
Alfred Alvarez was born in London, to an [[Ashkenazic Jewish]] mother and a father from a [[Sephardic Jewish]] family. He was educated at [[Hall School (Hampstead)|The Hall School]] in [[Hampstead]], London, and then [[Oundle School]] and [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]], where he took a First in English. He was subsequently elected as a [[Jane Eliza Procter Fellowship|Jane Eliza Procter Visiting Fellow]] at [[Princeton University]]. After teaching briefly in [[Oxford]] and the United States, he became a full-time writer in his late twenties. From 1956 to 1966, he was the poetry editor and critic for ''[[The Observer]]'', where he introduced British readers to [[John Berryman]], [[Robert Lowell]], [[Sylvia Plath]], [[Zbigniew Herbert]], and [[Miroslav Holub]].

Alvarez was the author of many non-fiction books. His renowned study of suicide, ''The Savage God,'' gained added resonance from his friendship with Plath. He also wrote on divorce (''Life After Marriage''), dreams (''Night''), and the oil industry (''Offshore''), as well as his hobbies of poker (''[[The Biggest Game In Town]]'') and mountaineering (''Feeding the Rat,'' a profile of his frequent climbing partner [[Mo Anthoine]]). His 1999 autobiography is entitled ''Where Did It All Go Right?''

His 1962 poetry anthology ''[[The New Poetry]]'' was hailed at the time as a fresh departure. It championed the [[Poetry of the United States|American style]], in relation to the perceived excessive 'gentility' of [[British poetry]] of the time. In 2010, he was awarded the [[Benson Medal]] by the Royal Society of Literature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rslit.org/content/benson|title=The Benson Medal|publisher=The Royal Society of Literature|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405221013/http://www.rslit.org/content/benson|archive-date=5 April 2010}}</ref>

==Film and TV==
In July 1989 Alvarez made an extended appearance on the Channel 4 discussion programme ''[[After Dark (TV programme)|After Dark]]'' to discuss gambling alongside, among others, [[Victor Lownes]] and [[David Berglas]]. Alvarez was portrayed by [[Jared Harris]] in the 2003 film ''[[Sylvia (2003 film)|Sylvia]]'', which chronicles the troubled relationship between Plath and her husband [[Ted Hughes]].

==Death==
He died at the age of 90 from [[viral pneumonia]]. He was survived by his second wife, Anne, and by their children, Luke and Kate. Another son, Adam, from his first marriage, with [[Frieda Lawrence]]'s granddaughter, Ursula Barr, predeceased him.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sutherland|first1=John|author-link=John Sutherland (author)|title=Al Alvarez obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/23/al-alvarez-obituary|work=The Guardian|date=23 September 2019|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190924091225/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/23/al-alvarez-obituary|archive-date=24 September 2019}}</ref> He is buried in [[Hampstead Cemetery]].
