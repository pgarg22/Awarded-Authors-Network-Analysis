==Biography==
Wright was born in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa 23 February 1920 of normal hearing. When he was 7 years old he contracted [[scarlet fever]] and was deafened as a result of the disease. He immigrated to England at the age of 14, where he was enrolled in the [[Northampton School for the Deaf]]. He studied at [[Oriel College, Oxford|Oriel College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], and graduated in 1942.

His first work, a poem entitled ''Eton Hall'', was published in 1942–43 in the journal ''[[Oxford Poetry]]''.<ref>{{cite web

He became a freelance writer in 1947 after working on the ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|Sunday Times]]'' newspaper for five years. With [[John Heath-Stubbs]] he edited the ''[[Faber Book of Twentieth Century Verse]]''. He edited the literary magazine [[Nimbus (literary magazine)|''Nimbus'']] from 1955 to 1956, during which time he published 19 poems, sent to him by [[Patrick Swift]], by [[Patrick Kavanagh]], which proved to be the turning point in Kavanagh's career.<ref>Antoinette Quinn (''Patrick Kavanagh: A Biography'', Gill & Macmillan, 2001, p. 359): "Publication there was to prove a turning point.…The publication of his next volume of verse, ''Come Dance with Kitty Stobling'', was to be directly linked to the mini-collection in ''Nimbus'', and his ''Collected Poems'' (1964)."</ref> He co-founded the quarterly literary review ''[[X (magazine)|X magazine]]'' which he co-edited from 1959 to 1962. 

His work includes three books about [[Portugal]] written with [[Patrick Swift]], his co-founder and co-editor of ''X''. He translated ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' and ''[[Beowulf]]''. He held strong views about [[translating Beowulf|translating ''Beowulf'']], choosing to represent it in prose rather than modern verse under the banner "better no colours than faked ones", and criticising the versions of other poets.<ref>{{cite book |last=Magennis |first=Hugh |author-link=Hugh Magennis (scholar) |title=Translating Beowulf : modern versions in English verse |publisher=[[D.S. Brewer]] |publication-place=Cambridge Rochester, New York |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-84384-394-8 |oclc=883647402 |pp=21–24}}</ref>

He penned an autobiography in 1969, and a biography of fellow South African poet [[Roy Campbell (poet)|Roy Campbell]] in 1961. Wright also edited a number of publications throughout the 1960s and 1970s. He held the Gregory Fellowship in Poetry at the [[University of Leeds]] (1965–67).

Wright was not reticent about his [[deafness]], and his autobiography, ''Deafness: A Personal Account'' (1969), is often used to give hearing people an insight into an experience they might not easily imagine.

In 1951, he married Philippa ("Pippa") Reid (d. 1985); and Oonagh Swift in 1987. Wright lived in [[Braithwaite]], just outside [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]], in the [[Lake District]] of England, and became good friends with [[Norman Nicholson]], a fellow poet, and his wife, often visiting each other.

Wright died of cancer in [[Waldron, East Sussex]], 28 August 1994.

==Quotes about==
*"His poetry was by turns lyrical, satirical and narrative. Sometimes it was fuelled by recollections of his homeland, although he was not politically active on South African issues." – ''[[The New York Times]]'')
*"profuse, fluent, versatile" and "the foremost South African poet of his generation." – ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''
*"It is a creative paradox that we owe to a deaf man some of the most striking images of sound in contemporary English poetry." – [[Geoffrey Hill]], 1980
*"His poetry is remarkable for its quiet intelligence and humour, and the integrity of its style. The tone is conversational, though not in the sense of reproducing a factitious chattiness; rather, it creates the lively curve of an eminently humane mind's thinking and speaking" – T. J. G. Harris<ref>T. J. G. Harris (1994) ''The Oxford Companion to Twentieth-Century Poetry'', ed. Ian Hamilton. Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], p. 589.</ref>
