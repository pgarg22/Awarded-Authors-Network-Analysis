'''Nancy Yi Fan''' (born August 26, 1993 {{zh|t=范禕}}) is a [[Chinese American]] author who is best known for writing a series that currently consists of the novels ''[[Swordbird]]'', ''[[Sword Quest]]'', and ''[[Sword Mountain]]''.

==Biography==
Fan was born in [[Beijing, China]]. At the age of 7, she moved with her parents to [[Syracuse, New York]]. She started writing her first novel 3 years later, and completed the manuscript within a year. Fan's book became a ''New York Times Bestseller'', and she was featured on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' as one of the world's smartest kids. She then began writing ''[[Sword Quest]]'', a prequel to Swordbird, and published it two years later. Her third book, ''[[Sword Mountain]],'' was released in July 2012.

==Career==

===Swordbird===
Fan's novel was inspired by her lifelong love for birds. After awaking from a vivid dream about birds at war while simultaneously wrestling with her feelings about terrorism and September 11, Fan wrote ''Swordbird'' as a way to convey her message of peace to the world.<ref>{{Citation
