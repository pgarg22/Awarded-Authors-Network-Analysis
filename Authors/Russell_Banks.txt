According to an interview with ''[[The Independent]]'', he started to write when he was living in Miami in the late-1950s, though an interview with ''[[The Paris Review]]'' dates this to Banks's subsequent spell living in [[Boston]].

In popular culture, Banks was briefly mentioned in philosopher [[Richard Rorty]]'s 1996 [[future history]] essay "Fraternity Reigns" in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' as having written the fictional book ''Trampling the Vineyards'', described as "[[samizdat]]", in 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/29/magazine/fraternity-reigns.html|last=Rorty|first=Richard|title=Fraternity Reigns: Looking Backwards from the Year 2096|date=September 26, 1996|access-date=August 31, 2021|publisher=The New York Times Company}}</ref>

==Works and themes==
His work has been translated into twenty languages and has received numerous international prizes and awards.  He has written fiction, and more recently, non-fiction, with ''Dreaming up America''. His main works include the novels ''[[Continental Drift (novel)|Continental Drift]]'', ''[[Rule of the Bone]]'', ''[[Cloudsplitter]]'', ''[[The Sweet Hereafter (novel)|The Sweet Hereafter]]'', and ''Affliction''. The latter two novels were each made into feature films in 1997 (see [[The Sweet Hereafter (film)|''The Sweet Hereafter'']] and [[Affliction (1997 film)|''Affliction'']]).
Many of Banks's works reflect his working-class upbringing. His stories often show people facing tragedy and downturns in everyday life, expressing sadness and self-doubt, but also showing resilience and strength in the face of their difficulties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.identitytheory.com/interviews/birnbaum156.php|date=January 18, 2005|access-date=December 9, 2007|title=Interview: Russell Banks|work=IdentityTheory.com|archive-date=December 14, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214112758/http://www.identitytheory.com/interviews/birnbaum156.php|url-status=live}}</ref> Banks has also written [[short stories]], some of which appear in the collection ''[[The Angel on the Roof]]'', as well as poetry.  
Banks has also lived in [[Jamaica]]. Interviewed in 1998 for ''The Paris Review'', he stated that:

{{quote|1=After living in Jamaica and writing ''The Book of Jamaica'', I accepted that I was obliged, for example, to have African-American friends. I was obliged to address, deliberately, the overlapping social and racial contexts of my life. I'm a white man in a white-dominated, racialized society, therefore, if I want to I can live my whole life in a racial fantasy. Most white Americans do just that. Because we ''can''. In a color-defined society we are invited to think that white is not a color. We are invited to fantasize, and we act accordingly.<ref name=Paris/>}}
The themes of ''[[Continental Drift (novel)|Continental Drift]]'' (1985) include globalization and unrest in [[Haiti]]. His 2004 novel ''[[The Darling (novel)|The Darling]]'' is largely set in [[Liberia]] and deals with the racial and political experience of the white American narrator.

Writing in the ''Journal of American Studies'', Anthony Hutchison argues that, "[a]side from [[William Faulkner]] it is difficult to think of a white twentieth-century American writer who has negotiated the issue of race in as sustained, unflinching and intelligent a fashion as Russell Banks".<ref>{{cite journal|title=Representative Man: John Brown and the Politics of Redemption in Russell Banks's ''Cloudsplitter''|first=Anthony|last=Hutchison|journal=Journal of American Studies|volume=41|issue=1|pages=67–82|year=2007|doi=10.1017/S0021875806002751|s2cid=145078185}}</ref>

==Critics==
According to Robert Faggen in ''The Paris Review'', Banks's debut novel, ''Family Life'', "was not a critical success". His next volume, a collection of short stories called ''Searching for Survivors'', won Banks an [[O. Henry Award]]. A second collection of short stories, ''The New World'', published in 1978, "received acclaim for its blending of historical and semi-autobiographical material".<ref name=Paris/>

Many have admired Russell Banks' realistic writing, which often explores American social dilemmas and moral struggles. Reviewers have appreciated his portrayal of the working-class people struggling to overcome destructive relationships, poverty, drug abuse, and spiritual confusion. Scholars have variously compared Banks's fiction to the works of [[Raymond Carver]], [[Richard Ford]], and [[Andre Dubus]]. Christine Benvenuto has commented that "Banks writes with an intensely focused empathy and a compassionate sense of humor that help to keep readers, if not his characters, afloat through the misadventures and outright tragedies of his books."

In 2011, ''[[The Guardian]]'s'' [[Tom Cox (writer)|Tom Cox]] selected ''Cloudsplitter'' as one of his "overlooked classics of American literature".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/10/classic-american-literature-russell-banks-cloudsplitter|title=Overlooked classics of American literature: Cloudsplitter by Russell Banks|work=The Guardian|first=Tom|last=Cox|date=November 10, 2011|access-date=June 15, 2013|archive-date=December 27, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227101926/http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/10/classic-american-literature-russell-banks-cloudsplitter|url-status=live}}</ref>
