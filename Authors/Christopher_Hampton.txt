==Early life and theatrical debut==
Hampton was born in [[Faial Island|Faial]], [[Azores]], to British parents Dorothy Patience (née Herrington) and Bernard Patrick Hampton, a marine telecommunications engineer for [[Cable & Wireless plc|Cable & Wireless]].<ref name="O'Mahony">John O'Mahony [https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4173071,00.html "Worlds of his own"], ''The Guardian'', 21 April 2001. Retrieved on 9 August 2008.</ref><ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/77/Christopher-Hampton.html Christopher Hampton Biography (1946–)]</ref> His father's job led the family to settle in [[Aden]], Yemen, and Cairo and [[Alexandria]] in [[Egypt]], and later in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Zanzibar]]. During the [[Suez Crisis]] in 1956, the family had to flee Egypt under cover of darkness, leaving their possessions behind.

After a prep school at [[Reigate]] in [[Surrey]], Hampton attended the independent boarding school [[Lancing College]] near the village of [[Lancing, West Sussex|Lancing]] in [[West Sussex]] at the age of 13. There he won house colours for boxing and distinguished himself as a sergeant in the [[Combined Cadet Force]] (CCF). Among his contemporaries at Lancing was [[David Hare (dramatist)|David Hare]], later also a dramatist; poet [[Harry Guest]] was a teacher.

From 1964,<!-- John O'Mahony (''Guardian'') in 2001 says 1965. --> Hampton read German and French at [[New College, Oxford]], as a Sacher Scholar. He graduated with a starred First Class Degree in 1968.<ref name="Coveney">{{cite news|last=Coveney|first=Michael|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2006/mar/04/theatre.film |title=A talent to adapt|work=The Guardian|date=4 March 2006|access-date=21 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Healy|first=Patrick|title='Rebecca' producer hoper for Broadway run in 2013|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/rebecca-producer-hopes-for-broadway-run-in-2013/|work=The New York Times|access-date=26 January 2013|date=2 January 2013}}</ref>

Hampton became involved in the theatre while at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]]. The [[Oxford University Dramatic Society]] (OUDS) performed his original play ''When Did You Last See My Mother?'', about adolescent homosexuality. He drew from his own experiences at Lancing.<ref name="O'Mahony"/> Hampton sent the work to the play agent [[Peggy Ramsay]], who interested [[William Gaskill]] in it.<ref name="O'Mahony"/> The play was performed at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] in London, and soon transferred to the [[Comedy Theatre]]; in 1966, Hampton was the youngest writer in the modern era to have a play performed in the [[West End theatre|West End]].<ref name="O'Mahony"/> Hampton's work on screenplays for the cinema also began around this time. He adapted this play for [[Richard Attenborough]] and [[Bryan Forbes]], but a film version was never made.<ref name="Smurthwaite"/>

==Stage plays and other works==
From 1968 to 1970, Hampton worked as the Resident Dramatist at the Royal Court Theatre, and also as the company's literary manager.<ref name="O'Mahony"/> He continued to write plays: ''Total Eclipse'', about the French poets and lovers [[Arthur Rimbaud]] and [[Paul Verlaine]], was first performed in 1967 and at the Royal Court in 1968, but it was not well received at the time.<ref name="Billington2007">{{cite news|last=Billington|first=Michael|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2007/mar/26/michaelbillington.features11|title=Free radical|work=The Guardian|date=26 March 2007|access-date=23 July 2018}}</ref> ''[[The Philanthropist (play)|The Philanthropist]]'' (1970) is set in an English university town and was influenced by [[Molière]]'s ''[[The Misanthrope]]''. The Royal Court delayed a staging for two years because of an uncertainty over its prospects, but their production was one of the Royal Court's more successful works up to that point.<!-- ESC? --><ref name="O'Mahony"/> The production transferred to the Mayfair Theatre in London's [[West End theatre|West End]] and ran for nearly four years, winning the [[Evening Standard Theatre Awards|''Evening Standard'' Theatre Award]] for Best Comedy. It reached [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in New York City in 1971.<ref name="O'Mahony"/><ref name="Smurthwaite">{{cite news|last=Smurthwaite|first=Nick|url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/features/interviews/2016/christopher-hampton-for-as-long-as-i-can-remember-all-i-wanted-was-to-be-a-writer/|title=Christopher Hampton: 'For as long as I can remember, all I wanted was to be a writer'|work=The Stage|date=8 July 2016|access-date=20 June 2019}}</ref> 

His <!-- Peggy Ramsay is unnamed in the source. -->agent told him after this success: "You’ve got a choice: you can write the same play over and over for the next 30 years" or, alternatively, "you can decide to do something completely different every time".<ref name="Caplan">{{cite news|last=Caplan|first=Nina|url=https://www.timeout.com/london/film/christopher-hampton-interview-1|title=Christopher Hampton interview|work=Time Out|location=London|date=2009|access-date=23 July 2018}}</ref> He told her that he was writing a play about the "extermination of the Brazilian Indians in the 1960s".<ref name="Caplan"/> ''[[Savages (play)|Savages]]'', set during the period of the [[Brazilian military government|military government]] and derived from an article "Genocide in Brazil" by [[Norman Lewis (author)|Norman Lewis]], was first performed in 1973.<ref name="O'Mahony"/> His first produced film adaptation, of [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]]'s ''[[A Doll's House (1973 Garland film)|A Doll's House]]'' (1973), was directed by [[Patrick Garland]], and stars [[Anthony Hopkins]] and [[Claire Bloom]].<ref name="Smurthwaite" />

A sojourn in Hollywood led to an unproduced film adaptation of [[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe]]'s play ''[[Edward II (play)|Edward II]]'' and the original script for ''Carrington''. This period also inspired his play ''Tales from Hollywood'' (1980). This is a somewhat fictionalised account of exiled European writers living in the United States during the Second World War. (The lead character is based on [[Ödön von Horváth]], who died in Paris in 1938).<ref>{{cite news|last=Billington|first=Michael|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2001/may/03/theatre.artsfeatures2|title=Christopher Hampton's Hollywood horrors|date=3 May 2001|access-date=23 July 2018}}</ref> The play also explores the different philosophies of Horwath and the German playwright [[Bertolt Brecht]] (who lived in the United States in the 1940s). Hampton told ''[[The Guardian]]'' critic [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]] in 2007: "I lean towards the liberal writer, Horvath, rather than the revolutionary Brecht. I suppose I'm working out some internal conflict".<ref name="Billington2007"/> The play was commissioned by the [[Center Theatre Group]] in Los Angeles; the Group first <!-- Not the world premiere as stated in the source. -->performed it in 1982.<ref name="LATimes2010">{{cite news|last1=Ng|first1=David|last2=Hampton|first2=Christopher|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2010/10/christopher-hampton-revisits-tales-from-hollywood.html|title=A conversation: Christopher Hampton revisits ''Tales from Hollywood''|work=Los Angeles Times|date=13 October 2010|access-date=23 July 2018}}</ref> The play has been adapted in different versions for British and Polish television.<ref name="LATimes2010"/>

==Later works==
Hampton won the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] for his screen adaptation of his play ''[[Dangerous Liaisons]]'' (1988), directed by [[Stephen Frears]] and starring [[Glenn Close]], [[John Malkovich]], and [[Michelle Pfeiffer]].<ref name="Moreton" /> He worked on ''[[Carrington (film)|Carrington]]'' (1995) for 18 years, writing multiple drafts. The play explores the relationship between painter [[Dora Carrington]] and author [[Lytton Strachey]].<ref name="Smurthwaite" /> Hampton went on to direct the feature film ''Carrington'', starring [[Emma Thompson]] and [[Jonathan Pryce]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112637/|title = Carrington|website = [[IMDb]]|date = 10 November 1995}}</ref>

Hampton both wrote and directed ''[[Imagining Argentina (film)|Imagining Argentina]]'' (2003), his adaptation of [[Imagining Argentina|the 1987 novel]] by [[Lawrence Thornton]]. It explores society during the military dictatorship of [[Leopoldo Galtieri]], when the government conducted a [[Dirty War]] against opponents, killing many in "[[forced disappearance]]s." It starred [[Antonio Banderas]] and Emma Thompson. According to Hampton, this period of Argentinian history had not inspired a dramatic work before. "I decided to do something which it would be difficult to finance at a time when, for once, I was bombarded with offers.<ref name="Coveney" /> In 2007, Hampton was nominated for a second Academy Award for his screenplay and [[Atonement (2007 film)|adaptation]] of [[Ian McEwan]]'s novel ''[[Atonement (novel)|Atonement]]'', directed by [[Joe Wright]] and starring [[James McAvoy]], [[Keira Knightley]], and [[Saoirse Ronan]].<ref name="Oscar2008" />

Since the 1990s, Hampton has created the English translations of the works of French dramatists [[Yasmina Reza]] and [[Florian Zeller]]. Reza's ''[[Art (play)|Art]]'' ran for eight years in the West End, and was also produced in the United States.<ref name="Smurthwaite" /> Hampton translated Reza’s ''[[God of Carnage]]'', which was the third-longest running Broadway play in the 2000s, playing 24 premieres and 452 regular performances. ''[[God of Carnage]]'' garnered six Tony nominations and three wins in 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.playbill.com/article/just-the-list-winners-and-nominees-of-the-2009-tony-awards-com-161645|title=JUST THE LIST: Winners and Nominees of the 2009 Tony Awards|date=8 June 2009}}</ref> ''God of Carnage'' actors [[James Gandolfini]] and [[Marcia Gay Harden]], joined [[Philip Glass]], [[Phillip Noyce]] and a host of other artists in a short documentary celebrating their Tony Award success and Christopher’s 50 published plays and screenplays.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/69037771|title = Philip Glass, Christopher Hampton & James Gandolfini Celebrate in NYC|date = 24 June 2013}}</ref>

Hampton's translation into English of [[Michael Kunze]] and [[Sylvester Levay]]'s Austrian musical ''[[Rebecca (musical)|Rebecca]]'', based on [[Daphne du Maurier]]'s [[Rebecca (novel)|novel of the same name]], was supposed to premiere on Broadway in 2012. As of January 2013, its future was uncertain. The scheduled production became mired in scandal when "several investors were revealed to be concoctions of a rainmaking middleman."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/rebecca-producer-hopes-for-broadway-run-in-2013/ | work=The New York Times | first=Patrick | last=Healy | title='Rebecca' Producer Hopes For Broadway Run in 2013 | date=2 January 2013}}</ref>

In 2012, Hampton joined forces with [[Tiana Alexandra|Tiana Alexandra-Silliphant]] to form Hampton Silliphant Management & Productions, which presented the play ''[[Appomattox (opera)|Appomattox]]'' at the [[Guthrie Theater]] in Minneapolis, Minnesota.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/oct/22/christopher-hampton-america-play-appomattox|title = Christopher Hampton takes on America|website = [[TheGuardian.com]]|date = 22 October 2012}}</ref> The play concerns itself with historic events in the United States, 100 years apart in time: the historic meetings between Generals Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee, as well as Abraham Lincoln and Fredrick Douglass in 1865, and the later machinations of Lyndon Johnson, J. Edgar Hoover and Martin Luther King – which ultimately led to the passing of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]]. ''Appomattox'' was also performed as an opera with [[Philip Glass]] at [[The Kennedy Center]] in 2015.<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/appomattox-a-superb-night-at-the-opera/2015/11/15/29e46610-8b63-11e5-9a07-453018f9a0ec_story.html</ref>

In 2020, Hampton served as screenwriter and executive producer for ''[[The Singapore Grip]]'', an international TV mini-series exploring the Japanese invasion of Singapore during WWII.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/371053250|title="The Singapore Grip" 17mns Love to Cast & Crew!|date=4 November 2019}}</ref> Adapted from the novel by J.G. Ferrell, the story portrays the intrigues and ultimate upheaval of British colonialism at the time of the Fall of Singapore.<ref>https://thesingaporegrip.com/</ref> At the same year, Hampton co-wrote ''[[The Father (2020 film)|The Father]]'', starring Anthony Hopkins and [[Olivia Colman]], with Florian Zeller (based on Zeller's 2012 play ''[[Le Père]]''), who directed the film in his feature directorial debut. The film received critical acclaim, and both Hampton and Zeller won a [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA]] and an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay and received a [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]] nomination, while the film was nominated in the Best Picture categories.<ref name="Oscar2021"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.goldenglobes.com/articles/2021-nominations-78th-golden-globe-awards-have-been-announced|title=Nominations for the 78th Golden Globe Awards (2021) Announced}}</ref>

In March and April 2021, it was announced that Hampton and Zeller will co-write the adaptation of ''The Son'' (which serves as Zeller's and Hampton's follow-up to ''The Father'') with Zeller directing, and [[Hugh Jackman]] and [[Laura Dern]] attached to star in the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2021/03/oscar-nominations-the-father-florian-zeller-interview-the-son-1234714776/|title=Oscar-Nominated 'The Father' Director Florian Zeller Has Next Adaptation 'The Son' In The Works|first=Antonia|last=Blyth|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=15 March 2021|access-date=15 April 2021}}</ref><ref name="VarietyZellerJackmanDern">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2021/film/global/hugh-jackman-laura-dern-the-son-florian-zeller-1234951082/|title=Hugh Jackman and Laura Dern to Star in 'The Son,' From 'The Father' Director Florian Zeller and Co-Writer Christopher Hampton|author=Leo Barraclough|work=Variety|date=14 April 2021|access-date=15 April 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2021/04/hugh-jackman-laura-dern-the-son-father-florian-zeller-follow-up-1234734035/|title=Hugh Jackman & Laura Dern To Star In Florian Zeller's 'The Son', See-Saw To Produce Follow-Up To Oscar-Nominee 'The Father'|first=Andreas|last=Wiseman|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=14 April 2021|access-date=15 April 2021}}</ref>
