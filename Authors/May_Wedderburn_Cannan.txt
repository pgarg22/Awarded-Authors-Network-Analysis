'''May Wedderburn Cannan''' (14 October 1893 – 11 December 1973) was a [[British people|British]] [[poet]] who was active in [[World War I]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Foundation|first=Poetry|date=2020-06-23|title=May Wedderburn Cannan|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/may-wedderburn-cannan|access-date=2020-06-23|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en}}</ref>

==Biography==

===Early life===
May was the second of three daughters of Charles Cannan, [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of [[Trinity College, Oxford]] (he was in charge at the [[Oxford University Press]] from 1895 until his death in 1919).<ref>{{Cite web|title=May Wedderburn Cannan|url=https://spartacus-educational.com/Wcannan.htm|access-date=2020-06-23|website=Spartacus Educational|language=en}}</ref>

In 1911, at the age of 18, she joined the [[Voluntary Aid Detachment]], training as a nurse and eventually reaching the rank of [[Quartermaster]]. Sharon Ouditt, writing of women's role in the war, noted that: "For the nurses it was, like the nun's cross, the badge of their equal sacrifice." In a poem by May Wedderburn Cannan the [[Royal Red Cross|Red Cross]] sign is seen to be equivalent to the crossed swords indicating her lover's death in battle:

{{Blockquote|And all you asked of fame<br>Was crossed swords in the Army List,<br>My Dear, against your name.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924027944358 | page=[https://archive.org/details/cu31924027944358/page/n105 86] | quote=And all I asked of fame A scarlet cross on my breast, my Dear, For the swords by your name. | title=Valour and Vision: Poems of the War, 1914-1918| publisher=Longmans, Green & Company | last1=Trotter| first1=Jacqueline Theodore| year=1920}}</ref>}}

During the war, she went to [[Rouen]] in the spring of 1915, helping to run the [[Cafeteria|canteen]] at the railhead there for four weeks, then returning to help her father at the Oxford University Press, but finally returning to [[France]] in the [[espionage]] department at the [[War Office]] Department in [[Paris]] (1918), where she was finally reunited with her fiancé [[Bevil Quiller-Couch]].

Cannan published three volumes of poetry during and after the war. These were ''In War Time'' (1917), ''The Splendid Days'' (1919) which was dedicated to Bevil Quiller-Couch, and ''The House of Hope'' (1923), dedicated to her father. In 1934, she wrote one novel ''The Lonely Generation''.

[[Philip Larkin]] chose her poem "Rouen"<ref>[http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/rouen/ Rouen]</ref> to be included in the ''[[Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse]]'' (1973), commenting that it "had all the warmth and idealism of the VADS in the First World War. I find it enchanting".

===Later life===
Although Cannan ceased writing for publication in the 1920s, in her final years she completed an autobiographical work entitled ''Grey Ghosts and Voices'' (1976). The book looks back to her [[Edwardian period|Edwardian]] childhood, the war years and those years immediately afterwards.

Further unpublished poems, from a handwritten notebook, were published in ''The Tears of War'' (2000) by her great-niece Charlotte Fyfe, which also tells the story of her love affair with Bevil Quiller-Couch through autobiographical extracts and the letters from Bevil to Cannan.

==Family==
She was the sister of the novelist [[Joanna Cannan]].  She was the daughter of the academic [[Charles Cannan]] and cousin to the British novelist and playwright [[Gilbert Cannan]]. She is also aunt to the [[Josephine Pullein-Thompson|Pullein-Thompson sisters]] and the British dramatist and playwright [[Denis Cannan]], and a great-aunt of [[Charlotte Pullein-Thompson|Charlotte Popescu]] (Christine Pullein-Thompson's daughter).

She was engaged to Bevil Quiller-Couch, son of Sir [[Arthur Quiller-Couch]]. Bevil served as gunner in World War I, and survived without injury only to die in the [[Spanish flu]] [[pandemic]] in 1919. She subsequently married Percival James Slater, a [[Balloon (aircraft)|balloonist]] in World War I, and promoted to [[Brigadier]] in [[World War II]].

==Radio programme==

In 2002, [[BBC Radio 4]] presented a dramatised version of ''The Tears of War'' as the afternoon play for [[Armistice Day]].<ref>{{Cite news|date=2002-11-07|title=Afternoon Play: The Tears of War|language=en-GB|pages=139|work=The Radio Times|issue=4105|url=https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/df3797e4a14140d0bed7940419f09dcb|access-date=2020-06-23|issn=0033-8060}}</ref>
