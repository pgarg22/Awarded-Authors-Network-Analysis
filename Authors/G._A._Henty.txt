==Biography==

G. A. Henty was born in [[Trumpington, Cambridgeshire|Trumpington]], near [[Cambridge]]. He was a sickly child who had to spend long periods in bed.{{refn|group=note|Fenn notes that Henty himself wrote "I spent my boyhood, to the best of my recollection, in bed.{{r|Fenn-1907|p=2}}}} During his frequent illnesses he became an avid reader and developed a wide range of interests which he carried into adulthood. He attended [[Westminster School]], London, as a half-boarder when he was fourteen,{{r|Fenn-1907|p=2}} and later [[Gonville and Caius College]], Cambridge,<ref>{{acad|id=HNTY851GA|name=Henty, George Alfred}}</ref> where he was a keen sportsman. He left the university early without completing his degree to volunteer for the Army Hospital Commissariat when the [[Crimean War]] began. He was sent to the [[Crimea]] and while there he witnessed the appalling conditions under which the British soldier had to fight. His letters home were filled with vivid descriptions of what he saw. His father was impressed by his letters and sent them to [[The Morning Advertiser]] newspaper which printed them. This initial writing success was a factor in Henty's later decision to accept the offer to become a special correspondent, the early name for journalists now better known as [[war correspondent]]s.

Shortly before resigning from the army as a [[Captain (land)|captain]] in 1859 he married Elizabeth Finucane. The couple had four children. Elizabeth died in 1865 after a long illness and shortly after her death Henty began writing articles for the ''Standard'' newspaper. In 1866 the newspaper sent him as their special correspondent to report on the [[Austro-Prussian War|Austro-Italian War]] where he met [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]. He went on to cover the [[1868 Expedition to Abyssinia|1868 British punitive expedition to Abyssinia]], the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the [[Ashanti Confederacy#Third Anglo-Asante War|Ashanti War]], the [[Carlism|Carlist Rebellion]] in Spain and the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)#Balkan Crisis of 1875–76|Turco-Serbian War]].<ref name="hdotbe">Kathryne S. McDorman,"Henty, George Alfred" in ''Historical Dictionary of the British empire'' edited by James S. Olson and Robert Shadle. Greenwood Press, 1996 {{ISBN|0-313-27917-9}} (pp. 152–54, Volume 1).</ref> He also witnessed the opening of the [[Suez Canal]] and travelled to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], Russia and India.

Henty was a strong supporter of the [[British Empire]] all his life; according to literary critic Kathryn Castle: "Henty ... exemplified the ethos of the [British Empire], and glorified in its successes".<ref>Kathryn Castle. ''Britannia’s children : Reading Colonialism through children’s books and magazines''. Manchester University Press, 1996, {{ISBN|0-7190-2853-1}} (p. 55).</ref> Henty's ideas about politics were influenced by writers such as [[Sir Charles Dilke, 2nd Baronet|Sir Charles Dilke]] and [[Thomas Carlyle]].<ref name="hdotbe" />

Henty once related in an interview how his storytelling skills grew out of tales told after dinner to his children. He wrote his first children's book, ''Out on the Pampas'' in 1868, naming the book's main characters after his children. The book was published by Griffith and Farran in November 1870 with a title page date of 1871. While most of the 122 books he wrote were for children, he also wrote adult novels, non-fiction such as ''The March to Magdala'' and ''Those Other Animals'', short stories for the likes of ''The [[Boy's Own Paper]]'' and edited the ''[[Union Jack (magazine)|Union Jack]]'', a weekly boy's magazine.

Henty was "the most popular Boy's author of his day."<ref name=25-Million>{{ cite book |last1=Daart |first1=Robert L. |title=G. A. Henty: A Bibliography |chapter=Quotation from W. G. Blackie in February 1952 |pages=v |date=1971 |publisher=Dar-Web inc |location=Cedar Grove, NJ }}</ref> Blackie, who published his children's fiction in the UK, and W. G.

He further estimated that considering the US and other overseas authorised and pirated editions, a total of 25 million was not impossible.<ref name=25-Million /> Arnold notes this estimate and that there have been further editions since that estimate was made.<ref name=Arnold>{{ cite book |last1=Arnold |first1=Guy |title=Held Fast for England: G.

His children's novels typically revolved around a boy or young man living in troubled times. These ranged from the [[Punic War]] to more recent conflicts such as the [[Napoleonic Wars]] or the [[American Civil War]]. Henty's heroes – which occasionally included young ladies – are uniformly intelligent, courageous, honest and resourceful with plenty of 'pluck' yet are also modest.<ref name="oxford">[[Humphrey Carpenter]] and Mari Prichard,''The Oxford Companion to children's literature'' Oxford University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|978-0-19-860228-6}} (pp. 244-47).</ref> These themes have made Henty's novels popular today among many conservative Christians and [[Homeschooling|homeschoolers]].<ref name=Arnold/>  

[[File:GAHentyBrompton.jpg|thumb|Funerary monument, [[Brompton Cemetery]], London]]
Henty usually researched his novels by ordering several books on the subject he was writing on from libraries, and consulting them before beginning writing.<ref name="oxford" /> Some of his books were written about events (such as the Crimean War) that he witnessed himself; hence, these books are written with greater detail as Henty drew upon his first-hand experiences of people, places, and events.<ref name="oxford">[[Humphrey Carpenter]] and Mari Prichard,''The Oxford Companion to children's literature'' Oxford University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|978-0-19-860228-6}} (pp. 244-47).</ref>

On 16 November 1902, Henty died aboard his yacht in [[Weymouth Harbour, Dorset]], leaving unfinished his last novel, ''By Conduct and Courage'', which was completed by his son Captain C.G. Henty.<ref name=Arnold>{{ cite book |last1=Arnold |first1=Guy |title=Held Fast for England: G. A. Henty, Imperialist Boys Writer |chapter=Preface |date=1980 |publisher=Hamish Hamilton |location=London }}</ref>

Henty is buried in [[Brompton Cemetery]], London.<ref>[http://www.brompton-cemetery.org/ Brompton Cemetery Website].</ref>

==Influence==
G. A. Henty's commercial popularity encouraged other writers to try writing juvenile adventure stories in his style; "[[Herbert Strang]]", [[Henry Everett McNeil]], [[Percy F. Westerman]] and Captain [[Frederick Sadleir Brereton]] all wrote novels in "the Henty tradition", often incorporating then-contemporary themes such as [[aviation]] and [[First World War]] combat.<ref>Carpenter and Prichard,''The Oxford Companion to children's literature'', (p. 7).</ref> By the 1930s, however, interest in Henty's work was declining in Britain, and hence few children's writers there looked to his work as a model.<ref>{{cite book|author=Thwaite, Mary Florence|title= From Primer to Pleasure: An introduction to the history of children's books in England|publisher=Library Association|year=1963|page=181}}</ref>

==Bibliography==
[[File:To Herat and Cabul cover 1902.jpg|thumb|Cover of the 1902 first edition of ''To Herat and Cabul, A Story of the First Afghan War'' by G. A. Henty and illustrations by [[Charles Sheldon|Charles A. Sheldon]], published by [[Blackie and Son|Blackie and Son Ltd.]], London.]]

Henty wrote 122 works of historical fiction and all first editions had the date printed at the foot of the title page.<ref>{{cite book| first=Peter| last=Newbolt| title=G.A. Henty 1832–1902: A Bibliographical Study| isbn=978-1-85928-208-3| publisher=Scolar Press| date=1996| url-access=registration| url=https://archive.org/details/trent_0116404196192}}</ref> Several short stories published in book form are included in this total, with the stories taken from previously published full-length novels. The dates given below are those printed at the foot of the title page of the very first editions in the United Kingdom. It is a common misconception that American Henty titles were published before those of the UK. All Henty titles bar one were published in the UK before those of America. The simple explanation for this error of judgement is that Charles Scribner's Sons of New York dated their Henty first editions for the current year. The first UK editions published by Blackie were always dated for the coming year, to have them looking fresh for Christmas. The only Henty title published in book form in America before the UK book was ''In the Hands of the Cave-Dwellers'' dated 1900 and published by [[Harper & Brothers|Harper]] of New York. This title was published in book form in the UK in 1903, although the story itself had already been published in England prior to the first American edition, in ''The Boy's Own Annual''.

===UK and US availability===
In the late 1990s, a number of American publishers, such as Polyglot Press (Philadelphia, PA), PrestonSpeed, and the Lost Classics Book Company, began reprinting Henty's books and advocating their usage for conservative homeschoolers.<ref>"[http://www.economist.com/node/266302 Henty's Heroes]", ''The Economist'', 9 December 1999. Retrieved 26 October 2011.</ref> Reprints of all Henty's works are available from modern day British and American publishers. One such publisher and major modern advocate of Henty is the American scientist, homeschool curriculum publisher, and [[Oregon State Senate|Oregon State Senator]] [[Arthur B. Robinson]], who promotes the use of Henty's books as a supplement to his self-teaching homeschool curriculum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.henty.com/|title=Adventure, Character, History, and Vocabulary - Robinson Books - GA Henty Collection - Adventure Books for Boys|author=Administrator|work=henty.com}}</ref>

==Controversial views==
Even during his lifetime, Henty's work was contentious; some Victorian writers accused Henty's novels of being aggressively and obstinately [[Nationalism|nationalist]] and reactionary in such books as ''True to the Old Flag'' (1885) which features a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] protagonist fighting in the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]],<ref>Dennis Butts, "Exploiting a Formula: The Adventure Stories of G.A.

A Tale of the Rising in La Vendée'' (1900) which are strongly hostile to the [[French Revolution]].<ref>Butts, 2008.</ref><ref name="oxford" />

Henty's novel ''[[With Lee in Virginia, A Story of the American Civil War|With Lee in Virginia]]'' has a protagonist who fights on the side of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] against the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].<ref>"The English Novelists and the American Civil War", Charles E.

Retrieved 2015-03-11.</ref> Carpenter and Pritchard note that while "Henty's work is indeed full of racial (and class) [[stereotype]]s", he sometimes created sympathetic [[Minority group|ethnic minority]] characters, such as the Indian servant who marries a white woman in ''With Clive in India'', and point out Henty admired the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish Empire]]. Some even accuse Henty of holding blacks in utter contempt, and this is expressed in novels such as ''By Sheer Pluck: A Tale of the Ashanti War'' and ''A Roving Commission, or, Through the Black Insurrection at Hayti''.<ref name="oxford" /> Kathryne S. McDorman states Henty disliked blacks and also, in Henty's fiction, that "[[Boer]]s and [[Jews]] were considered equally ignoble".<ref name="hdotbe" /> In ''By Sheer Pluck: A Tale of the Ashanti War'', Mr. Goodenough, an [[entomologist]] remarks to the hero: “They [Negroes] are just like children ... They are always either laughing or quarrelling. They are good-natured and passionate, indolent, but will work hard for a time; clever up to a certain point, densely stupid beyond. The intelligence of an average negro is about equal to that of a European child of ten years old. ... They are fluent talkers, but their ideas are borrowed. They are absolutely without originality, absolutely without inventive power. Living among white men, their imitative faculties enable them to attain a considerable amount of civilization. Left alone to their own devices they retrograde into a state little above their native savagery.”

In the Preface to his novel ''A Roving Commission'' (1900) Henty claims "the condition of the negroes in [[Haiti|Hayti]] has fallen to the level of that of the savage African tribes" and argues "unless some strong white power should occupy the island and enforce law and order" this situation will not change.<ref>Chris Bongie, ''Friends and enemies: the scribal politics of post/colonial literature'' Liverpool University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|1-84631-142-X}} (p. 140 ).</ref> In the novel ''Facing Death: A Tale of the Coal Mines'' Henty comes down against [[Strike action|strikes]] and has the working class hero of the novel, Jack Simpson, quell a strike among coal miners.<ref>[[Guy Arnold]], ''Held Fast for England: G.A Henty, Imperialist Boys' Writer''.

A review by Deirdre H. McMahon in ''Studies of the Novel'' in 2010 refers to his novels as jingoist and racist and states that during the previous decade "Numerous reviews in right-wing and conservative Christian journals and websites applaud Henty’s texts as model readings and thoughtful presents for children, especially boys. These reviews often ignore Henty’s racism by packaging his version of empire as refreshingly heroic and patriotic."<ref>{{cite journal|last=McMahon|first=Deirdre H.|title="Quick, Ethel, Your Rifle!": Portable Britishness and Flexible Gender Roles in G.A.

In 1888, on the bookjacket for ''Captain Bayley's Heir'', ''[[The Times]]'' wrote that Henty's character in ''With Lee in Virginia,'' "bravely proving his sympathy with the slaves of brutal masters" and escapes through "the devotion of a black servant and of a [[Fugitive slaves in the United States|runaway slave]] whom he had assisted".

It's historical fiction, yet there's very little fiction." Heid said of the characters portrayed in Henty's books and Heirloom Audio's productions, "Who's a real hero? Jay Cutler or Aaron Rodgers, or Francis Drake? Who had the guts, the belief in God's sovereignty? I want to tell the stories that young people think, 'I could imagine doing something like that.' I want them to dream big. There was a time in our country we really had big dreams, thought we could do big things. For some reason, we don't talk like that, take risks like that."<ref name="jturner@qconline.com"/> Heid added that too often in schools, "history becomes kind of a data dump, dead guys and dates." But with Henty, "History is anything but boring. It's amazing. William Wallace was a real person, had real struggles of his own. He had hopes and dreams and ambitions, struggles like anyone else, doubts and flaws."<ref name="jturner@qconline.com"/>
