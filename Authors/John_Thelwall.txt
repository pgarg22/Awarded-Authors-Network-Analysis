'''John Thelwall''' (27 July 1764 – 17 February 1834) was a radical British orator, writer, political reformer, journalist, poet, elocutionist and speech therapist.<ref name="english-heritage">[https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/blue-plaques/john-thelwall/ Thelwall, John (1764-1834)], english-heritage.org.uk.

==Life==
[[File:GillrayThelwall.jpg|thumb|"Copenhagen house" (1795) by [[James Gillray]], depicting Thelwall]]
Thelwall was born in [[Covent Garden]], London, but was descended from a Welsh family which had its seat at Plas y Ward, [[Denbighshire]]. He was the son of a silk merchant, Joseph Thelwall, who died in 1772 leaving the family in economic distress. He attended Highgate school between 1774 and 1777 but had to leave school to help his mother, who had decided to keep the silk business running.

Thelwall's fondness for books showed up at an early age, earning him the scorn of his mother. It also made it impossible for him to fulfill an apprenticeship as a tailor. Young Thelwall also tried to make a living in an attorney office, but his morals and eccentricity made him quit the job and try to depend on his writing as a journalist and editor.

Thelwall also developed a significant interest in medical science and attended lectures at Guy's and St Thomas hospitals in London; he was friends with [[Astley Cooper]], a renowned surgeon in London. Thelwall's particular interest lay in understanding and participating in topical debates concerning cognition and 'vitality'. Jasmin Solomonescu argues that "Thelwall's medical training became compounded with his radical politics and developing theories of language and the imagination to provide a model and a lexicon for his vision of reform".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Solomonescu |first1=Jasmin |title=John Thelwall and the Materialist Imagination |date=2015 |publisher=Palgrave |page=14}}</ref> In 1793, Thelwall presented a paper at the Physical Society in London in which he debated the subject of 'animal vitality'; the paper was subsequently published as ''An Essay Towards a Definition of Animal Vitality'' (1793). Considering the views of several well-known sources, Thelwall proposed that vitality or life was a combination of 'specific organisation' and 'proper stimuli'; blood is the means by which the 'stimuli' is conveyed to different parts of the body: 'I consider the blood independent of its nutritive power, as the specific medium by which the stimuli must be conveyed to the different parts of the organised frame, so as to produce the Vital Action. This Blood in its passage through the Lungs, collects a something, which generates a specific heat....But what is this something, this vivifying principle?...Something that is contained in the atmosphere, something of a powerful and exquisitely subtile nature'. Thelwall's views formed part of a larger debate concerning the relationship between the emerging scientific understandings and traditional views regarding the divine nature of creation. 

Thelwall's career as an editor and journalist was quite successful, but the highlight of this period was his political activism. In the wake of the [[French Revolution]], he became "intoxicated in the French doctrines of the day".<ref>Quoted in Seccombe, T. ''John Thelwall'', in Stephen L. and Lee S. (eds.), ''Dictionary of National Biography'', Smith Elder & Co., London 1885–1900.</ref> He started to hold talks in London's radical societies and, having made acquaintance with fellow radical [[John Horne Tooke]], contributed to ground the [[London Corresponding Society]] in 1792. In 1794 he, Horne Tooke and [[Thomas Hardy (political reformer)|Thomas Hardy]] were [[1794 Treason Trials|tried for treason]] following lectures protesting at the arrest of other political activists. After spending some time at the [[Tower of London|Tower]] and at [[Newgate Prison|Newgate]], the three were acquitted. Government officials who considered him to be the most dangerous man in Britain continued to hound him even after his acquittal. In 1795, after prime minister [[William Pitt the Younger]]'s Gagging Acts (the [[Treason Act 1795|Treason Act]] and [[Seditious Meetings Act 1795|Seditious Meetings Act]]) received [[Royal Assent]], Thelwall's lectures had a shift in theme, from contemporary political comment to the [[history of Rome]] to dodge censorship.<ref>Thelwall's approach to history is closely examined in Steve Poole's ''Not Precedents to be Followed, but Examples to be Weighed'' in Poole 2009.</ref>

Still, loyalists stormed Thelwall's public outings, forcing him to leave London and tour England. During many of the lectures in eastern England angry mobs impeded the hearings and in 1798 Thelwall decided to retire from politics. 

Thelwall also wrote poetry and in the second half of the 1790s associated with Romantic poets such as [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] and [[William Wordsworth]].<ref>David Fairer, [http://www.friendsofcoleridge.com/MembersOnly/CB21Fairer.html 'A little sparring about Poetry': Coleridge and Thelwall, 1796-8], ''Coleridge Bulletin'', New Series 21, Spring 2003, pp. 20-33.

Retrieved 30 May 2019.</ref> Coleridge praised Thelwell as "intrepid, eloquent, and honest; perhaps the only acting democrat that is honest".<ref name="english-heritage" /> Through his correspondence and meetings with these poets Thelwall would forge a link between the Romantic movement in poetry and radical politics. Thelwall built himself a "hermitage" at [[Llyswen]] Farm, Brecknockshire, during his exile in Wales.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.euromanticism.org/john-thelwalls-summer-study/|title=John Thelwall's Summer Study – European Romanticisms in Association}}</ref> His friends William and [[Dorothy Wordsworth]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] visited him there in August 1798.<ref>T. McFarland et al., The Coleridge connection, p.78 (1990)</ref> 

In 1800 Thelwall reappeared as an elocution teacher, which in practice was a combination of [[Speech-language pathology|speech therapist]] and [[rhetoric]] teacher. 

His career was very successful, and by 1818 he had earned enough money to buy a journal, ''The Champion'', through which he called for parliamentary reform and in which he "denounced the government’s actions in the [[Peterloo Massacre|Peterloo massacre]], and voiced scepticism about the [[Cato Street Conspiracy|Cato Street conspiracy]]".<ref name="english-heritage" /> His volcanic style and political views, though, were not fitting for the middle-class public of the journal, which ended up in considerable losses. Thelwall therefore resumed his lecture touring and died in Bath during one of those tours.

==Personal life==
Thelwall married twice. He married Susannah Vellum at Oakham in 1797. She died in 1816, leaving him four children to support. In 1837 his second wife, Cecil, wrote a biography on the early life of her husband.<ref name="logopaedic" />

Thelwall's eldest son was the clergyman and scholar [[Algernon Sidney Thelwall]] and his lesser-known younger son was called John Hampden Thelwall or Hampden Thelwall. Both sons were named after 17th century republicans.<ref>[http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/auth/thelwall.htm John Thelwall (1764–1834)]</ref>

==Legacy==
In the field of politics Thelwall promoted "democratic reform, universal suffrage and freedom of speech".<ref name="english-heritage" /> Steve Poole has argued: "Thelwall's was perhaps the most important individual voice in the history of British radicalism... Nobody was better than Thelwall at communicating the Rights of Man to a wide audience."<ref name="uwe">[https://info.uwe.ac.uk/news/uwenews/news.aspx?id=906 UWE helps restore forgotten radical's grave in Bath], uwe.ac.uk. Retrieved 30 May 2019.</ref>

In the field of speech therapy, he was the "first to make speech correction a profession" and the first to write a book on the subject and to establish a school.<ref name="logopaedic">Denyse Rockey, [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/13682827709011313?journalCode=ilcd18 "The Logopaedic thought of John Thelwall, 1764-1834: First British Speech Therapist"], in: ''British Journal of Disorders of Communication'', Volume 12, 1977, Issue 2, p. 83.</ref>

In the film [[Pandaemonium (film)|''Pandaemonium'']] (2000), Thelwall was played by [[Andy Serkis]].

A restoration project on Thelwall's grave in [[Church of St Swithin, Bath|St Swithin's]] burial ground in [[Walcot, Bath]] was launched in 2006 by the Regional History Centre at [[University of the West of England]] (UWE).<ref name="uwe" />

In October 2009, the [[Dalhousie University]] Theatre Department produced the first staging of Thelwall's 1801 melodrama ''The Fairy of the Lake'', as a complement to the John Thelwall conference being hosted at the time by the University's English Department.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theatre.dal.ca/DalTheatre%20Productions/The%20Fairy%20of%20the%20Lake/ |title=Fairy of the Lake |accessdate=2009-10-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091101143240/http://theatre.dal.ca/DalTheatre%20Productions/The%20Fairy%20of%20the%20Lake/ |archivedate=1 November 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

A [[blue plaque]] was erected in 2018 by [[English Heritage]] at 40 [[Bedford Place]], Bloomsbury, London, where he lived and worked, 1806–1813.
