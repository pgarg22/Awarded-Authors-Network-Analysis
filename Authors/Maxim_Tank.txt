Because of the hunger in Russia, the family returned to its home village, which by then became part of the [[Second Polish Republic]].

In 1928, Skurko joined an underground communist youth organization in his school in [[Radashkovichy]]. Despite good performance in the school, in 1929 he was expelled together with several other pupils for participating in a protest against closure of [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] schools by the Polish authorities. He was also expelled from his following school in [[Wilno]] for participation in student protests.

In early 1930s, Jaŭhien Skurko participated in the Belarusian underground communist activism, writing for Belarusian and Polish underground publications. In 1932, he was arrested and placed in the [[Lukiškės Prison]] in Wilno.<ref name=miadziel>{{cite web

In late 1932, he illegally crossed the border with the [[Soviet Union]] and joined Belarusian underground group in [[Minsk]]. He was eventually arrested by the Soviet authorities, interrogated by the [[NKVD]]<ref name=maximtankru/> and deported to Poland. After his return, he was an activist of the illegal youth branch of the [[Communist Party of West Belarus]] in Wilno and [[Navahrudak]]. He was several times arrested and spent a total of two years in prison.

In 1936, Skurko was admitted into the underground [[Communist Party of West Belarus]].

==Career in the USSR==

After the annexation of [[West Belarus]] by the Soviet Union, Skurko worked as a culture journalist and as an education administrator in [[Vilejka]].<ref name=miadziel/>

After the beginning of the war, Skurko was evacuated to [[Saratov]] and then returned to the [[Bryansk Front]] to work as a reporter for several Soviet publications.<ref name=miadziel/>

In 1945 – 1948, Skurko worked as editor at the satirical magazine ''[[Vozhyk]]''. From 1948 to 1966, he was editor in chief of the major Belarusian literature magazine ''[[Polymia]]''.<ref name=maximtankru/>

Since the late 1940s, Skurko held various senior positions in the Belarusian Soviet legislative system. In 1947–1971 he was member of the [[Supreme Soviet of Belarus]]; of which he was chairman in 1963–1971.<ref name=maximtankru/> In 1969 – 1989 he was member of the [[Supreme Soviet of the USSR]].<ref name=miadziel/>

After [[Belarus]] regained independence, Maksim Tank admitted being supporter of the Belarusian [[Flag of Belarus|White, Red and White flag]] and opposed the controversial [[1995 Belarusian referendum|referendum to change the national symbols of Belarus]] organized by president [[Alexander Lukashenko]].<ref name=nn/>

Maksim Tank died in Minsk in August 1995.
