'''Marijane Minaberri''' or '''Marie-Jeanne Minaberry''' (7 September 1926 – 23 February 2017) was an Basque author and radio broadcaster. She began writing articles for herself at the age of 20 and then worked as [[Banca, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Banca]]'s town hall municipal secretary for a decade. Minaberri then taught 10 and 11-year-old students at [[Bayonne]]'s Saint Louis de Gonzague church before beginning a broadcasting career on Radio Côte Basque, Gure Irratia and Lapurdi Irratia. She wrote a series of poems and children's stories in both Basque in French and was a member of the [[Euskaltzaindia]]. Minaberri is considered a pioneer in Basque radio broadcasting and researchers consider two of her works the beginning of learning of Basque children's literature.
