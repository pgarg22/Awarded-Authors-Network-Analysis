==Career==
===Poetry===
Watsky started slam poetry at the age of 15.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://eds.a.ebscohost.com.ezproxy2.library.arizona.edu/ehost/detail/detail?sid=c7738616-92bc-4917-b0ce-922f4d5deda5%40sessionmgr4003&vid=10&hid=4111&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=mah&AN=58701626|title = Social Climber|last = Rutherford|first = Kevin|date = February 12, 2011|journal = Billboard}}</ref> As a teen, he won around a dozen slams in the Bay Area, and was on the team that took fourth place in the national contest in 2005.<ref>{{Cite journal| last = Johnson| first = Chip| title = Local poets lift voices at nationals

Watsky's poetry incorporates political and social themes. In 2006, in the midst of a lively performance to a sold-out crowd, Watsky likened politicians' behavior to a common bar pick-up line, and won the night's top score.<ref>{{Cite journal| last = Atkinson| first = Ian| title = Watsky perfection at teen poetry slam| journal = [[Oakland Tribune]]| location = [[Oakland, California]] | date = March 31, 2006| url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=OKTB&p_theme=oktb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=1108184CE7E97010&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM| access-date = February 3, 2011}}</ref> He also appeared in Season Six, Episode Two of ''[[Def Poetry Jam]]'' that year, performing his poem "V for Virgin."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=212iH9jckT8|title=George Watsky- Def Poetry 6 FULL|last=WATSKY!|via=YouTube}}</ref>

Reviewing a 2008 performance at [[Brandeis University]], Sarah Bayer wrote, "Skinny, quirky George Watsky was next, with the night's most innovative piece. Watsky, a sophomore at Emerson College and a member of the grand prize-winning team from San Francisco at the National Youth Poetry Slam in 2006, adjusted the microphone to different parts of his body, imitated the sound of rewinding tape and recited binary code (a trope that caught the eye of headliner Saul Williams) in an altogether amusing performance."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bayer |first=Sarah |title=Spoken word show a grand slam: VOCAL 2008, a benefit concert featuring nationally renowned slam poets, raised money for a local community center.

Watsky continues to implement spoken word into his current career as a musician with songs like "Tiny Glowing Screens Pt. 1-3", "Cannonball.", “Springtime in New York” and “Dreams & Boxes”.<ref>{{Citation|last=WATSKY!|title=Watsky- Tiny Glowing Screens Pt 2 [Cardboard Castles]|date=March 5, 2013|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SWZ7qWEjUs|access-date=October 17, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Disc Jockey|title=Watsky - Cannonball (feat.

[[File:George Watsky TEDxSFED 2011.jpg|thumb|Watsky at [[TEDx]]SFED in 2011]]
In 2009, Watsky produced a 15-track [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] album titled ''[[Watsky (album)|Watsky]]''. The album produced one successful single, known as ''Stupidass''.

====2012–2013: ''Nothing Like The First Time'' and ''Cardboard Castles''====
[[File:George Watsky 2013.jpg|thumb|Watsky with a fan in 2013]]
On June 10, 2012, Watsky released a free mixtape entitled ''Nothing Like The First Time.'' The mixtape coincided with his first official tour of the same name beginning in July, featuring his touring band Créme Fraîche, with support from [[Dumbfoundead]]. It included dates in Chicago, New York City, Boston, Northampton, Jacksonville, Atlanta, Toronto, and London.

Watsky released ''Live! At the Troubadour'', a fully mixed concert CD of his Los Angeles show from the Nothing Like The First Time tour, in August 2012. He also started a production company with Brad Simpson called Steel Wool Media.<ref>{{cite web| title = Steel Wool Media| year = 2012| url = http://www.steelwoolmedia.com/| access-date = January 24, 2013}}</ref>

In January 2013, Watsky announced he would be releasing a new album entitled ''[[Cardboard Castles]]'' on March 12, 2013. On the same date, he announced tour dates for the Cardboard Castles tour, which included dates in many major cities in the U.S. and Canada such as Austin, New Orleans, Gainesville, Orlando, D.C., Philadelphia, Northampton, Boston, Denver, Los Angeles, Toronto, Vancouver and New York City. Tour dates for Europe (including the UK, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands) were released shortly after.<ref>[http://georgewatsky.com/tour/ Cardboard Castle Tour Dates | George Watsky's Official Website].

The album was released on March 12, 2013, through [[Welk Music Group]], topping the iTunes Hip Hop Charts in the US, Canada, and the United Kingdom due in part to a [[Twitter]] campaign.<ref>[https://twitter.com/gwatsky/status/311517507917860865 Twitter / gwatsky: #CardboardCastles is #1 in].

Retrieved on November 19, 2013.</ref> He then went on his follow-up to the Nothing Like The First Time tour called "Sloppy Seconds."

Watsky made a web-series with YouTube channel LOUD titled ''Watsky's Making an Album''. It consisted of 9 main episodes and many behind the scenes and live videos from the ''Nothing Like The First Time'' tour.  The web series was restarted on March 12, 2013, with the first episode of Season 2 (entitled ''Watsky's Releasing An Album''), coinciding with the release of his second album, ''[[Cardboard Castles]]''.

In November 2013 the [[Vans Warped]] Tour was briefly shut down after Watsky made a stage jump from the 35&nbsp;ft high rigging during the band's performance in London.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Baggs | first = Michael | title = Vans Warped Tour halted after Watsky + Wax stage accident | journal = [[Gigwise]] | date = November 17, 2013 | url = http://www.gigwise.com/news/86131/vans-warped-tour-halted-after-watsky-+-wax-stage-accident#svQdRaUMXRRtb6pA.99 | access-date = November 18, 2013}}</ref> During the stage jump the audience parted.

On May 21, 2014, during one of his Watsky Wednesday vlogs, he announced that the title of his new album would be ''[[All You Can Do (album)|All You Can Do]]'', as well as explaining that he wanted to keep his family ties in the album (announcing that his father would be on the cover and that he would like his mother to be on an alternate cover) and that the album would be released in August.<ref>{{Citation|last=George Watsky|title=Final Watsky Wednesday (for now!)|date=May 21, 2014|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McyXfqYnPlw|access-date=October 17, 2016}}</ref>  He had tweeted earlier in the month that the first single from ''All You Can Do'' would be released on June 10, 2014.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/gwatsky/status/464218855745654784|title=WATSKY x INFINITY on Twitter|newspaper=Twitter|access-date=October 17, 2016}}</ref>

The album was made available for preorder on June 10, 2014, on [[iTunes]] (with a download of the first single," [[All You Can Do|Whoa Whoa Whoa]]"); a physical copy and limited edition double-vinyl were made available for pre-order on his website.

His live band Créme Fraîche consists of Max Miller-Loran (keys/trumpet), Kush Mody (keys, bass) Pat Dimitri (guitar), Chukwudi Hodge (drums) and others.

In December 2014, Watsky's YouTube channel was listed on [[New Media Rockstars]] Top 100 Channels, ranked at #51.<ref>{{cite web|title=The NMR Top 100 YouTube Channels: 75-51!|url= http://newmediarockstars.com/2014/12/the-nmr-top-100-youtube-channels-75-51/|website=New Media Rockstars|access-date=January 6, 2015}}</ref>

On May 30, 2015, Watsky announced through social media that he would be releasing ''All You Can Do: Live From The Regency Ballroom'', the live album that he recorded during the All You Can Do tour, on June 2 on BitTorrent, Bandcamp, Spotify, iTunes & Soundcloud. He also announced that he would be embarking on a monthlong club tour, called the ''Meaner Than The Average'' tour, with Créme Fraîche, A-1, and Mikos Da Gawd in late July and August. The focus of the tour would be to hit cities that he didn't get to on the All You Can Do tour. He also said that many of the shows would be in various Canadian cities that he's never performed in.

In January 2016, he announced through various YouTube videos that he would release an album due sometime in the summer.<ref>{{Citation|last=Taryn Southern|title=COCKROACH COCKTAIL CHALLENGE w/ WATSKY! {{!}} Party Fun Times Ep. 7|date=January 19, 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RPV3zQz9Zc?t=13m45s|access-date=October 17, 2016}}</ref>
