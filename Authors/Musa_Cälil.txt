==Biography==

===Early life===
Musa Cälil was born in [[Mustafino, Orenburg Oblast|Mustafino]], a village in [[Orenburg Governorate]], in the family of [[Junkman]]. He graduated from {{Interlanguage link multi|Husainiya Madrasa|tt|3=«Хөсәения» мәдрәсәсе}}<ref group=a>co-spelled ''Xösäyeniä''</ref> in [[Orenburg]]. His first published works were revolutionary verses. The Turkic poetic tradition of ''[[aruz]]'' traced in Cälil's early works, which attributed to ''[[Ghisyanism]]'', a style of revolt, found in the Tatar poetry of the early 1920s. In 1919, he entered the underground [[Komsomol]] cell of Orenburg, which was under the control of [[White movement|Whites]] that time. Then, Musa participated in the [[Russian Civil War]] against pro-White forces, but due to his nonage he didn't fight at the front, but in a [[Red Army]] unit. In 1920, Cälil returned to his native village, establishing the pro-Communist youth organization The Red Flower there. He also became a Komsomol activist in Mustafino. He represented his village at the governorate Komsomol conference.<ref name="mustafin">{{in lang|ru}} [http://www.kitap.net.ru/mustafin/2.php Rafael Mustafin Biography Dzhalil] kitap.net.ru. Retrieved on 2010-07-22.</ref>

===Literary life===
In 1920, the [[Tatar ASSR]] was established and [[Kazan]] became its capital. In 1922, Musa, along with other Tatar poets{{Who|date=July 2010}}, moved to Kazan. During this time, verses that he wrote include "The Red Host", "The Red Holyday", "The Red Hero", "The Red Way", "The Red Force", and "The Red Banner". In Kazan, Cälil worked as copyist for the ''Qızıl Tatarstan'' newspaper and studied at [[rabfak]] of the Oriental Pedagogical Institute. He became acquainted with Tatar poets such as [[Qawi Näcmi]], [[Hadi Taqtaş]], and [[Ğädel Qutuy]]. In 1924, he became a member of the literary society October, backing [[Proletkult]]. Since that year, his poetry departed from Ghisyanism and aruz and turned to the Tatar folk verse. His first collection of verses, ''Barabız'' (''We are going'') was published in 1925. One concept that the verses dealt with was pre-revolutionary life.<!--The royalties were transferred to the Международный фонд помощи иностранным рабочим--><ref name="mustafin"/>

During 1925 and 1926, Cälil became an instructor of [[Orsk]] [[uyezd]] Komsomol cell, where he visited Tatar and [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] [[aul]]s, agitating for Komsomol there. In 1926, he became the member of Orenburg governorate Komsomol committee. In 1927, Musa moved to [[Moscow]], where he combined his study in the [[Moscow State University]] and job in [[Tatar]]-[[Bashkir people|Bashkir]] section of the Central Committee of Komsomol. Cälil joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|All-Union Communist Party (b)]] in 1929, which was the same year that his second collection, ''İptäşkä'' (i.e. ''To the Comrade''; [[Yañalif|Jaꞑalif]]: ''Iptəşkə'') was published. Living in Moscow, Cälil met Russian poets Zharov, Bezymensky, and [[Mikhail Arkadyevich Svetlov|Svetlov]]; Cälil also attended [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]]'s performances. He entered the [[Moscow Association of Proletarian Writers]]; he became its third secretary and a leader of its Tatar section. By the end of the 1920s, lyricism appeared in Cälil's poetry.<ref name="mustafin"/>

In 1931, Cälil graduated from the literature faculty of [[Moscow University]]. Until 1932, he was a chief editor of the Tatar children's magazine ''Keckenə iptəşlər'', which was later renamed to ''Oktəbr Balasь'' (''[[Little Octobrist]]''). Then, he managed the section of literature and art in the central Tatar newspaper ''Kommunist''. In 1934, Musa Cälil published two collections. The first of them, ''The Millions, Decorated with Orders'' was devoted mostly to youth and Komsomol, whereas in the second, ''Verses and Poems'', was a general compilation of his writing. However, many{{Weasel-inline|date=July 2010}} of his lyrical poems weren't published due to being at conflict with [[Stalinism]].<ref name="mustafin"/>

In 1935, the first Russian translations of his poems were published. During the 1930s, Cälil also translated to the [[Tatar language]] writings of poets of the USSR peoples, such as [[Shota Rustaveli]], [[Taras Shevchenko]], [[Pushkin]], [[Nikolay Nekrasov|Nekrasov]], [[Vladimir Mayakovsky|Mayakovsky]] and [[Vasily Lebedev-Kumach|Lebedev-Kumach]]. In the late 1930s, he tended to write epic poems, such as ''The Director and the Sun'' (1935), ''Cihan'' (1935–1938), and ''The Postman'' (1938). As a [[playwright]] of the [[Tatar State Opera]], he wrote four librettos for Tatar operas, one of which is ''Altınçäç'' (''Golden Hair Maiden'') of [[Näcip Cihanov]].<ref name="mustafin"/> In 1939 and 1940, he served as the chairman of the Tatar ASSR Union of Writers.<ref name="TES">{{TES|Муса Җәлил}}</ref>

===During World War II===
[[File:Памятник Мусе Джалилю в Оренбурге.JPG|Musa Cälil monument in [[Orenburg]]|thumb|right|300px]]
After the [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]] in June 1941, Cälil volunteered for the Red Army. Graduating [[political commissar]] courses, he arrived at the [[Volkhov Front]] and became a [[war correspondent]] in the ''Otvaga'' newspaper. Cälil also wrote verse, which was at first patriotic but later evolving into lyricism concerning war and people experiencing war.

In June 1942, during the [[Lyuban Offensive Operation]], Cälil's unit was encircled; when his unit tried to run a blockade he became seriously wounded, shell-shocked, and captured. After months{{When|date=July 2010}} in concentration camps for Soviet prisoners of war, including [[Stalag-340]] in [[Daugavpils]], [[Latvia]]<ref>[http://www.rosculture.ru/milestones/day/show/?id=22958 Федеральное агентство по культуре и кинематографии - Муса Джалиль<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and [[Spandau]], Cälil was transferred to [[Dęblin]], a fortified stronghold in [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany|
German-occupied Poland]]. There, the [[Wehrmacht]] were assembling prisoners of [[Idel-Ural]] and Eastern nationalities in the camp. Cälil responded by forming a resistance group.

In late 1942, the Wehrmacht started forming what they called "[[Wehrmacht foreign volunteers and conscripts|national legions]]". Among others, [[Volga Tatar Legion|the Idel-Ural legion]] was formed in [[:pl:Obóz_szkoleniowy_Lager_Jedlnia|Lager Jedlnia]], [[General Government]], consisting of prisoners of war belonging to the nations of the [[Volga]] basin. Since the majority of the legion were [[Volga Tatars]], the Germans usually called it the [[Idel Ural Legion|Volga-Tatar Legion]]. The Wehrmacht began preparing the legionnaires for action against the Red Army. Cälil joined the [[Wehrmacht]] propaganda unit for the legion under the [[Pseudonym|false name]] of Gumeroff. Cälil's group set out to wreck the [[National Socialist]] plans, to convince the men to use the weapons they would be supplied with against the [[National Socialists]] themselves. The members of the resistance group infiltrated the editorial board of the ''Idel-Ural'' newspaper the German command produced, and printed and circulated anti-Hitler leaflets among the legionnaires into esoteric action groups consisting of five men each. The first battalion of the Volga-Tatar Legion that was sent to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] mutinied, shot all the German officers there, and defected to the [[Soviet partisans]] in [[Belarus]].

====Capture and death====
On 10 August 1943, he was arrested with his comrades by the [[Gestapo]] and sent to [[Moabit]] Prison in [[Berlin]]. He sat in a cell with [[Belgium|Belgian]] patriot and resistance fighter [[André Timmermans]] and a [[Polish people|Polish]] prisoner. Cälil studied the [[German language]] in prison to communicate with his cellmates. In prison, he compiled verses composed in the prison into self-made notebooks. He and his group of 12 were sentenced to death on 12 February 1944 and [[guillotine]]d at [[Plötzensee Prison]], Berlin, on August 25 . His body was never recovered.

===Prison notebooks===
[[Image:Moabit Notebook1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Moabit Notebook''s title]]
[[Image:Moabit Notebook2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Moabit Notebook''s title]]
Cälil's first notebook was preserved by the Tatars [[Ğabbas Şäripov]] and then [[Niğmät Teregulov]], both of whom later died in Stalin's camps. Şäripov was also imprisoned in Moabit and received Cälil's and [[Abdulla Aliş]]'s writings when the prison guards hid from bombing. To preserve the writings, Cälil's group fenced him off.<ref name="qassaf">{{in lang|ru}} Мусса Джалиль. Моабитские тетради. Татарское книжное издательство. Казань 1963. Составитель - Г. Кашшаф.</ref> The second notebook was preserved by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] cellmate André Timmermans. Those notebooks were passed to the Tatar ASSR Union of Writers in 1946 and 1947 correspondingly. They were published as two books under the title ''Moabit Däftäre'' (''The Moabit Notebook''). Cälil's widow Äminä Zalyalova gave the originals to the National Museum of [[Tatarstan]] for safekeeping.

One notebook was brought to the Soviet embassy in [[Rome]] by the ethnically Tatar [[Turkey|Turkish citizen]] Kazim Mirşan in 1946. However, this notebook was lost in the archives of [[SMERSH]], and pursuits for it since 1979 have had no results.{{Citation needed|reason=date  July 2010|date=July 2010}}
These notebooks were in [[arabic script]].

===Rehabilitation and recognition===
[[File:1959 CPA 2334.jpg|thumb|158px|right|A 1959 Musa Cälil U.S.S.R. [[postage stamp]]]]
In 1946, [[Ministry for State Security (Soviet Union)|MGB]] opened a file on Musa Cälil branding him as a traitor. In April 1947, his name was included in the list of wanted "dangerous criminals".

Then Tatar writers and the Tatarstan department of state security proved Cälil's [[Resistance movement|underground]] work against the [[Third Reich]] and his death. In 1953, ''The Moabit Notebooks'' were published in Kazan<ref name="TES"/> and the Russian translation also was published in ''[[Literaturnaya Gazeta]]'', owing to its editor, [[Konstantin Simonov]].<ref>{{cite book

A monument to Musa Cälil is placed near the [[Kazan Kremlin]]; the museum in his flat was opened in Kazan in 1983.<ref name="TES"/> His poetry was popularized in the Soviet Union and the [[Warsaw Pact]] countries.

Soviet Tatar composer [[Nazib Zhiganov]] wrote an "opera-poem" ''[[Dzhalil (opera)|Dzhalil]]'' based on the life of Cälil. This was premiered in Tatar in Kazan in 1957, and later recorded by conductor [[Boris Khaykin]] for Moscow radio.

Musa Cälil Tatar Library was opened in Constanta, Romania in 2014.<ref name=nazar>{{cite web|last1=Nazar Look|title=Musa Ğelil Kitapkanasî - Musa Jalil Library|url=http://www.nazar-look.com/musa-jalil-library|website=www.nazar-look.com|publisher=Nazar Look Journal|accessdate=5 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413004922/http://www.nazar-look.com/musa-jalil-library|archive-date=2015-04-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The Symphony-poem "Musa Jalil" written by [[Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Tatar]] composer [[Almaz Monasypov]] in 1971 was dedicated to the poet. A [[minor planet]] [[3082 Dzhalil]] discovered by Soviet astronomer [[Tamara Mikhailovna Smirnova]] in 1972 is named after him.<ref>{{cite book
