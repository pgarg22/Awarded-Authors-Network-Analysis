'''Hilda Doolittle''' (September 10, 1886&nbsp;– September 27, 1961) was an American poet, novelist, and memoirist, associated with the early 20th-century avant-garde [[Imagism|Imagist]] group of poets, including [[Ezra Pound]] and [[Richard Aldington]]. She published under the [[pen name]] '''H.D.'''

Hilda was born in [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]], in 1886, and grew up just outside Philadelphia in [[Upper Darby]], Pennsylvania, and attended [[Bryn Mawr College]]. She moved to London in 1911, where she played a central role within the then-emerging Imagist movement. Young and charismatic, she was championed by the [[Modernist poetry in English|modernist poet]] Ezra Pound, who was instrumental in building her career. From 1916 to 1917, she acted as the literary editor of the ''[[The Egoist (periodical)|Egoist]]'' journal, while her poetry appeared in the ''[[English Review]]'' and the ''[[The Transatlantic Review (1924)|Transatlantic Review]]''. During [[World War I]], H.D. suffered the death of her brother and the breakup of her marriage to the poet [[Richard Aldington]],<ref>Featherstone, Simon. "War Poetry: An Introductory Reader (Critical Readers in Theory & Practice)". Routledge, 1995. 164</ref> and these events weighed heavily on her later poetry. Imagist authority Glenn Hughes wrote that 'her loneliness cries out from her poems'.<ref>Hughes, Glenn, ''Imagism & the Imagists'', Stanford University Press, 1931</ref> She had a deep interest in [[Ancient Greek literature]], and her poetry often borrowed from [[Greek mythology]] and classical poets. Her work is noted for its incorporation of natural scenes and objects, which are often used to evoke a particular feeling or mood.

She befriended [[Sigmund Freud]] during the 1930s, and became his patient in order to understand and express her [[bisexuality]], her residual war trauma, her writing, and her spiritual experiences.<ref>Bertram, Vicki. "Kicking Daffodils: Twentieth-century Women Poets". Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1997. 39. {{ISBN|0-7486-0782-X}}</ref>  H.D. married once, and undertook a number of relationships with both men and women. She was unapologetic about her sexuality, and thus became an icon for both the [[LGBT rights movement|LGBT rights]] and [[feminist movement]]s when her poems, plays, letters and essays were rediscovered during the 1970s and 1980s.

==Career==

===Early life===
H.D. was born on September 10, 1886, into the Moravian community in [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]].<ref name="scott">Scott, Bonnie Kime. "The Oxford Companion to Women's Writing in the United States".

Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 2000. 87. {{ISBN|0-313-30943-4}}</ref> and her mother, Helen (Wolle), was a [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] with a strong interest in music. H.D. was their only surviving daughter in a family of five sons.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Norton Anthology Of Literature By Women|last1=Gilbert|first1=Sandra M.|last2=Gubar|first2=Susan|publisher=Norton|year=2007|isbn=978-0-393-93014-6|location=New York, NY|pages=280}}</ref> In 1896, Charles Doolittle was appointed Flower Professor of Astronomy at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and the family moved to a house in the Highland Park neighborhood of [[Upper Darby Township, Pennsylvania|Upper Darby]]. She attended Philadelphia's [[Religious Society of Friends|Friends']] [[Friends' Central School|Central High School]], at Fifteenth and Race streets, graduating in 1905. In 1901, she met and befriended Ezra Pound, who was to play a major role both in her private life and her emergence as a writer. In 1905, Pound presented her with a sheaf of love poems under the collective title ''Hilda's Book''.<ref>"[http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poet/99.html Selected Poetry of H. D.

That year, H.D. attended [[Bryn Mawr College]]<ref name="bryher">"[http://www.brynmawr.edu/library/speccoll/guides/hd.shtml H.D. and Bryher Papers, c. 1916–1972] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529063620/http://www.brynmawr.edu/library/speccoll/guides/hd.shtml |date=May 29, 2016}}".

While at the college, she met poets [[Marianne Moore]] and [[William Carlos Williams]]. Her first published writings, stories for children, were published in ''The Comrade'', a Philadelphia Presbyterian Church paper, between 1909 and 1913, mostly under the name Edith Gray. In 1907, she became engaged to Pound. Her father disapproved of her fiancé,<ref>Nadel, Ira. "The Cambridge Introduction to Ezra Pound." Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 2007. 5. {{ISBN|978-0-521-63069-6}}. OCLC 74523220</ref> and by the time Pound left for Europe in 1908, the engagement had been called off. Around this time, H.D. started a relationship with a young female art student at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Frances Josepha Gregg.<ref>"[http://www.glbtq.com/literature/doolittle_h.html Doolittle, Hilda (1886–1961)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627032910/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/doolittle_h.html |date=June 27, 2015}}". New England Publishing Associates. Retrieved on October 5, 2007.</ref> After spending part of 1910 living in [[Greenwich Village]], she sailed to Europe with Gregg and Gregg's mother in 1911. In Europe, H.D. began a more serious career as a writer. Her relationship with Gregg cooled, and she met a writing enthusiast named [[Brigit Patmore]] with whom she became involved in an affair. Patmore introduced H.D. to another poet, [[Richard Aldington]].

===H.D. Imagiste===
[[File:Hilda 'H.D.' Doolittle.jpg|thumb|H.D., c. 1921]]

Soon after arriving in England, H.D. showed Pound some of her poems. He had already begun to meet with other poets at the Eiffel Tower restaurant in [[Soho]]. He was impressed by her poems' closeness to the ideas and principles he had been discussing with Aldington, with whom he had shared plans to reform contemporary poetry through [[free verse]], the [[Waka (poetry)#Tanka|tanka]] and the tightness and conciseness of the [[haiku]], and the removal of all unnecessary verbiage. In summer 1912, the three poets declared themselves the "three original Imagists", and set out their principles as:
#Direct treatment of the 'thing' whether subjective or objective.
#To use absolutely no word that does not contribute to the presentation.
#As regarding rhythm: to compose in the sequence of the musical phrase, not in the sequence of a metronome.<ref>Lan, Feng. "Ezra Pound and Confucianism: Remaking Humanism in the Face of Modernity".

Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1998. 374. {{ISBN|0-226-45074-0}}</ref>

During a meeting with H.D. in a tea room near the [[British Museum]] that year, Pound appended the signature ''H.D. Imagiste'' to her poetry, creating a label that was to stick to the poet for most of her writing life.<ref>King, Michael * Pearson, Norman. "H. D., and Ezra Pound, End to Torment: A Memoir of Ezra Pound." New York: New Directions, 1979. 18</ref> However, H.D. told different versions of this story at various times, and during her career published under a variety of pseudonyms.<ref>Friedman (1990), 35–46</ref> That same year [[Harriet Monroe]] started her magazine ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'', and asked Pound to act as foreign editor. In October, he submitted three poems each by H.D. and Aldington under the rubric ''Imagiste''. Aldington's poems were in the November issue of ''Poetry'', and H.D.'s poems "Hermes of the Ways", "Orchard" and "Epigram" in the January 1913 issue. Imagism as a movement was launched with H.D. as its prime exponent.

The early models for the Imagist group were from Japan, and H.D. often visited the exclusive Print Room at the British Museum in the company of Richard Aldington and the curator and poet [[Laurence Binyon]], in order to examine [[Nishiki-e]] prints that incorporated [[Waka (poetry)|traditional Japanese verse]].<ref>Arrowsmith, Rupert Richard.

In 1915, H.D. and Aldington launched the Poets' Translation Series, pamphlets of translations from Greek and Latin classics. H.D. worked on the plays by [[Euripides]], publishing in 1916 a translation of choruses from ''[[Iphigeneia at Aulis]]'', in 1919 a translation of choruses from ''Iphigeneia at Aulis'' and ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]'', an adaptation of ''Hippolytus'' called ''Hippolytus Temporizes'' (1927), a translation of choruses from ''[[The Bacchae]]'' and ''[[Hecuba (play)|Hecuba]]'' (1931), and ''Euripides' Ion'' (1937) a loose translation of ''[[Ion (play)|Ion]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=H.D. |others=Introduction by Camper, Carol |title=Hippolytus Temporizes & Ion: Adaptations of Two Plays by Euripides |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=84SmgvKptTMC |year= 2004|publisher=New Directions |isbn= 978-0-8112-1553-4|pages=xi |chapter=Introduction }}</ref>

She continued her association with the group until the final issue of the ''Some Imagist Poets'' anthology in 1917. She and Aldington did most of the editorial work on the 1915 anthology. Her work also appeared in Aldington's ''Imagist Anthology 1930.'' All of her poetry up to the end of the 1930s was written in an Imagist mode, utilising spare use of language,<ref>Marshall, Bill & Johnston, Cristina.

In a special Imagist issue of ''[[The Egoist (periodical)|The Egoist]]'' magazine in May 1915, the poet and critic [[Harold Monro]] called H.D.'s early work "petty poetry", denoting "either poverty of imagination or needlessly excessive restraint".<ref>Levenson, Michael.

===World War I and after===
H.D. married Aldington in 1913; however, their only child, a daughter, was stillborn in 1915. Aldington enlisted in the army. The couple became estranged, and he reportedly took a mistress in 1917. H.D. became involved in a close but platonic relationship with [[D. H. Lawrence]]. Her first book, ''Sea Garden'', was published in 1916, and she was appointed assistant editor of ''The Egoist'', replacing her husband. In 1918, her brother Gilbert was killed in action, and that March she moved into a cottage in Cornwall with the composer [[Cecil Gray (composer)|Cecil Gray]], a friend of Lawrence. She became pregnant with Gray's child;<ref>Champion, Laurie; Sampath, Emmanuel Nelson. ''American Women Writers, 1900–1945: A Bio-Bibliographical Critical Sourcebook.'' Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 2000. {{ISBN|0-313-30943-4}}. 88</ref> however, by the time she realised she was expecting, the relationship had cooled and Gray had returned to live in London.<ref>Korg, 50</ref> When Aldington returned from active service he was noticeably traumatised, and he and H.D. later separated.

Close to the end of the war, H.D. met the wealthy English novelist [[Bryher (novelist)|Bryher]] (Annie Winifred Ellerman). They lived together until 1946, and although both took numerous other partners, Bryher remained her lover for the rest of H.D.'s life. In 1919, H.D. came close to death when she gave birth to her daughter Frances Perdita Aldington—although the father was not Aldington, but Gray—while suffering from [[Spanish flu|war influenza]].<ref>Friedman, 9</ref> During this time, her father, who had never recovered from Gilbert's death, died. In 1919, H.D. wrote one of her few known statements on poetics,<ref>Blau DuPlessis, Rachel. "H.D., the Career of that Struggle: The Career of That Struggle". 40. Indiana: Indiana University Press, 1986. {{ISBN|0-253-32702-4}}</ref> ''Notes on Thought and Vision'', which was unpublished until 1982.<ref>[[Cassandra Laity|Laity, Cassandra]]. "H.D. and the Victorian Fin de Siècle". Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996. 80. {{ISBN|0-521-55414-4}}</ref> In this, she speaks of poets (herself included) as belonging to a kind of elite group of visionaries with the power to "turn the whole tide of human thought".

H.D. and Aldington attempted to salvage their relationship during this time, but he was suffering from the effects of his participation in the war (possibly [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]) and they became estranged, living completely separate lives, but not divorcing until 1938. They remained friends, however, for the rest of their lives. From 1920, her relationship with Bryher became closer, and the pair travelled in Egypt, Greece and the United States before eventually settling in Switzerland. Bryher entered a [[marriage of convenience]] in 1921 with [[Robert McAlmon]], which allowed him to fund his publishing ventures in Paris by utilising some of her personal wealth for his Contact Press.<ref>Caserio, Robert L.

Bryher and McAlmon divorced in 1927.<ref>Freud, Sigmund; H.D.; Bryher; Stanford Friedman, Susan. ''Analyzing Freud: Letters of H.D., Bryher, and Their Circle''. New Directions, 2002. 568</ref>

===Novels, films and psychoanalysis===
In the early 1920s, H.D. began three projected cycles of novels.<ref>Stanford Friedman, Susan. "Gender, Modernity; H.D.'s Fiction". ''American Literature'' 64, No. 4, December 1992. 839–40</ref> The first, ''Magna Graeca'', consists of ''Palimpsest'' (1921) and ''Hedylus'' (1928). The ''Magna Graeca'' novels use their classical settings to explore the poetic vocation, particularly as it applies to women in a patriarchal literary culture. The ''Madrigal'' cycle consists of ''[[HERmione]]'', ''Bid Me to Live'', ''Paint It Today'' and ''Asphodel'', and is largely autobiographical, dealing with the development of the female artist and the conflict between heterosexual and lesbian desire. ''Kora and Ka'' and ''The Usual Star'', two novellas from the ''Borderline'' cycle, were published in 1933. In this period, she also wrote ''Pilate's Wife'', ''Mira-Mare'' and ''Nights''.

During this period her mother had died, and Bryher had divorced her husband, only to marry H.D.'s new male lover, Kenneth Macpherson. H.D., Bryher and Macpherson lived together and traveled through Europe as what the poet and critic [[Barbara Guest]] termed in her biography of H.D. as a 'menagerie of three.'<ref>[[Michiko Kakutani|Kakutani, Michiko]].

Bryher and Macpherson set up the magazine ''Close Up'' (to which H.D. regularly contributed) as a medium for intellectual discussion of cinema. In 1927, the small independent film cinema group POOL or [[Pool Group]] was established (largely funded with Bryher's inheritance) and was managed by all three.<ref>Connor, 19</ref> Only one POOL film survives in its entirety, ''[[Borderline (1930 film)|Borderline]]'' (1930), which featured H.D. and [[Paul Robeson]] in the lead roles. In common with the ''Borderline'' novellas, the film explores extreme psychic states and their relationship to surface reality. As well as acting in this film, H.D. wrote an explanatory pamphlet to accompany it, a piece later published in ''Close Up''.<ref>Mandel, Charlotte.

===World War II and after===
H.D. and Bryher spent the duration of World War II in London. During this time, H.D. wrote ''The Gift'', a memoir of her childhood and family life in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, which reflects on people and events in her background that helped shape her as a writer.<ref>Mandel, Charlotte "[http://www.imagists.org/hd/giftrev.html H.D.'s The Gift] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511003940/http://www.imagists.org/hd/giftrev.html |date=May 11, 2015}}".

After the war, H.D. and Bryher no longer lived together, but remained in contact. H.D. moved to Switzerland where, in the spring of 1946, she suffered a severe mental breakdown, which resulted in her staying in a clinic until the autumn of that year. Apart from a number of trips to the States, H.D. spent the rest of her life in Switzerland. In the late 1950s, she underwent more treatment, this time with the psychoanalyst Erich Heydt.<ref>Stanford Friedman, Susan. ''The Emergence of H.D. The Emergence of H.D''. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1987. 20</ref> At Heydt's prompting, she wrote ''End to Torment'', a memoir of her relationship with Pound, who allowed the poems of ''Hilda's Book'' to be included when the book was published. Doolittle was one of the leading figures in the bohemian culture of London in the early decades of the century. Her later poetry explores traditional epic themes, such as violence and war, from a feminist perspective. H.D. was the first woman to be granted the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] medal.<ref name="bryher" />

===Later life and death===
During the 1950s, H.D. wrote a considerable amount of poetry, most notably ''[[Helen in Egypt]]'' (written between 1952 and 1954), an examination of a male-centred [[epic poetry]] from a feminist point of view. She used [[Euripides]]' play ''[[Helen (play)|Helen]]'' as a starting point for a reinterpretation of the basis of the [[Trojan War]] and, by extension, of war itself.<ref>Twitchell-Waas, Jeffrey.

Retrieved on October 7, 2007.</ref> This work has been seen by some critics, including Jeffrey Twitchell-Waas, as H.D.'s response to Pound's ''[[The Cantos|Cantos]]'', a work she greatly admired. Other poems from this period include ''Sagesse'', ''Winter Love'' and ''Hermetic Definition''. These three were published posthumously with the collective title ''Hermetic Definition'' (1972). The poem ''Hermetic Definition'' takes as its starting points her love for a man 30 years her junior and the line 'so slow is the rose to open' from Pound's ''Canto 106''. ''Sagesse'', written in bed after H.D. had broken her hip in a fall, serves as a kind of [[coda (music)|coda]] to ''Trilogy'', being partly written in the voice of a young female Blitz survivor who finds herself living in fear of the [[Nuclear weapon#Fission bombs|atom bomb]]. ''Winter Love'' was written together with ''End to Torment'' and uses as narrator the [[Homer]]ic figure of [[Penelope]] to restate the material of the memoir in poetic form. At one time, H.D. considered appending this poem as a coda to ''Helen in Egypt.''<ref>Sword, Helen. <!-- article title? --> ''Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature'' 14, No. 2, Autumn 1995. 347–62</ref>
