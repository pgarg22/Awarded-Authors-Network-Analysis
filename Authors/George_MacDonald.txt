'''George MacDonald''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|}} (10 December 1824 – 18 September 1905) was a Scottish author, poet and Christian minister. He was a pioneering figure in the field of modern [[fantasy literature]] and the mentor of fellow writer [[Lewis Carroll]]. In addition to his fairy tales, MacDonald wrote several works of Christian theology, including several collections of sermons.

His writings have been cited as a major literary influence by many notable authors including  [[Lewis Carroll]], [[W.&nbsp;H. Auden]], [[David Lindsay (novelist)|David Lindsay]],<ref>[http://textualities.net/tag/david-lindsay David Lindsay: A Scottish Genius]</ref> [[J. M.

C.&nbsp;S. Lewis wrote that he regarded MacDonald as his "master": "Picking up a copy of ''[[Phantastes]]'' one day at a train-station bookstall, I began to read.

==Early life==
George MacDonald was born on 10 December 1824 at [[Huntly, Scotland|Huntly]], [[Aberdeenshire (traditional)|Aberdeenshire]], Scotland. His father, a farmer, was one of the [[MacDonald of Glencoe|MacDonalds of Glen Coe]] and a direct descendant of one of the families that suffered in the [[Massacre of Glencoe|massacre of 1692]].<ref>Raeper, William, ''George MacDonald'' (1987), pp. 15–17.</ref><ref>For more information on this massacre, see {{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/scottishhistory/union/trails_union_glencoe.shtml|title=The Massacre of Glen Coe|last=Anon|work=Scottish History: The making of the Union|publisher=BBC|access-date=6 November 2012}} For more information on the site of the event, see {{Cite document |url=http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/153486/ |title=Site Record for Glencoe, National Trust For Scotland Glencoe Visitor Centre |publisher=Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland}}</ref>

MacDonald grew up in an unusually literate environment: one of his maternal uncles was a notable Celtic scholar, editor of the ''Gaelic  Highland  Dictionary'' and collector of fairy tales and Celtic poetry. His paternal grandfather had supported the publication of an ''Ossian'' edition, the controversial Celtic text believed by some to have contributed to the starting of European Romanticism. MacDonald's step-uncle was a Shakespeare scholar, and his paternal cousin another Celtic academic. Both his parents were readers, his father harbouring predilections for Newton, Burns, Cowper, Chalmers, Coleridge, and Darwin, to quote a few, while his mother had received a classical education which included multiple languages.<ref name="Johnson2014">{{cite journal |author=Johnson, K.

MacDonald grew up in the [[Congregational church|Congregational Church]], with an atmosphere of [[Calvinism]]. However, his family was atypical, with his paternal grandfather a Catholic-born, fiddle-playing, Presbyterian  elder; his paternal grandmother an Independent church rebel; his mother was a sister to the Gaelic-speaking radical who became moderator of the disrupting Free Church, while his step-mother, to whom he was also very close, was the daughter of a Scottish Episcopalian priest.<ref name=Johnson2014/>

MacDonald graduated from the [[University of Aberdeen]] in 1845 with a master's degree in chemistry and physics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://calms.abdn.ac.uk/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqServer=Calms&dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqPos=0&dsqSearch=(RefNo='MS%202718')|title=Archives and Manuscripts – Special Collections – University of Aberdeen|website=calms.abdn.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=10 February 2018}}</ref> He spent the next several years struggling with matters of faith and deciding what to do with his life.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=A Complete Identity: The Youthful Hero in the Work of G.A.

MacDonald's first novel ''David Elginbrod'' was published in 1863.<ref name=bbc/>

George MacDonald is often regarded as the founding father of modern fantasy writing.<ref name=bbc/>
George MacDonald's best-known works are ''[[Phantastes]]'', ''[[The Princess and the Goblin]]'', ''[[At the Back of the North Wind]]'', and ''[[Lilith (novel)|Lilith]]'' (1895), all fantasy novels, and [[fairy tales]] such as "[[The Light Princess]]", "[[The Golden Key (MacDonald book)|The Golden Key]]", and "[[The Lost Princess|The Wise Woman]]". "I write, not for children," he wrote, "but for the child-like, whether they be of five, or fifty, or seventy-five."<ref>{{cite book |author=MacDonald, George |year=1893 |title=A Dish of Orts: Chiefly Papers on the Imagination, and on Shakespeare |publisher=Project Gutenberg |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9393 |access-date=6 October 2016}}</ref> MacDonald also published some volumes of sermons, the pulpit not having proved an unreservedly successful venue.<ref name="PoemHunter" />

After his literary success, MacDonald went on to do a lecture tour in the United States in 1872–1873, after being invited to do so by a lecture company, the [[Boston Lyceum Bureau]]. On the tour, MacDonald lectured about other poets such as [[Robert Burns]], Shakespeare, and [[Tom Hood]].

MacDonald served as a mentor to [[Lewis Carroll]]: it was MacDonald's advice, and the enthusiastic reception of ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice]]'' by MacDonald's many sons and daughters, that convinced Carroll to submit ''Alice'' for publication.<ref name=reis>Reis, Richard H.

MacDonald's use of [[fantasy fiction|fantasy]] as a literary medium for exploring the human condition greatly influenced a generation of notable authors, including [[C. S. Lewis]], who featured him as a character in his ''[[The Great Divorce]]''.<ref>{{cite book |author = Lindskoog, Kathryn Ann |year=2001 |title=Surprised by C.S.

{{quote |This collection, as I have said, was designed not to revive MacDonald's literary reputation but to spread his religious teaching. Hence most of my extracts are taken from the three volumes of ''Unspoken Sermons''. My own debt to this book is almost as great as one man can owe to another: and nearly all serious inquirers to whom I have introduced it acknowledge that it has given them great help—sometimes indispensable help toward the very acceptance of the Christian faith.&nbsp;...

I know hardly any other writer who seems to be closer, or more continually close, to the Spirit of Christ Himself. Hence his Christ-like union of tenderness and severity. Nowhere else outside the New Testament have I found terror and comfort so intertwined. ...

In making this collection I was discharging a debt of justice. I have never concealed the fact that I regarded him as my master; indeed I fancy I have never written a book in which I did not quote from him. But it has not seemed to me that those who have received my books kindly take even now sufficient notice of the affiliation. Honesty drives me to emphasize it.<ref name="LewisAnth">{{cite book |editor=C. S. Lewis |editor-link=C. S. Lewis |date=1947 |title=George MacDonald: An Anthology}}</ref>}}

Others he influenced include [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] and [[Madeleine L'Engle]].<ref name="Johnson2014" /><ref name="PoemHunter" /> MacDonald's non-fantasy novels, such as ''Alec Forbes'', had their influence as well; they were among the first realistic Scottish novels, and as such MacDonald has been credited with founding the "[[kailyard school]]" of Scottish writing.<ref>Sutherland, D.

==Theology==
{{Original research section|date=August 2016}}
{{more citations needed section|date=March 2017}}

According to biographer William Raeper, MacDonald's theology "celebrated the rediscovery of God as Father, and sought to encourage an intuitive response to God and Christ through quickening his readers' spirits in their reading of the Bible and their perception of nature."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.george-macdonald.com/resources1/theology.html|title=George MacDonald's Theology|website=The George MacDonald WWW Page}}</ref>

MacDonald's oft-mentioned [[Universal reconciliation|universalism]] is not the idea that everyone will automatically be saved, but is closer to [[Gregory of Nyssa]] in the view that all will ultimately repent and be restored to God.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=12-04-015-v|title=An Orthodox Appreciation of George MacDonald|website=Touchstone: A Journal of Mere Christianity}}</ref>

MacDonald appears to have never felt comfortable with some aspects of Calvinist doctrine, feeling that its principles were inherently "unfair";<ref name=reis/> when the doctrine of [[predestination]] was first explained to him, he burst into tears (although assured that he was one of the [[Predestination (Calvinism)|elect]]).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Later novels, such as ''Robert Falconer'' and ''[[Lilith (novel)|Lilith]]'', show a distaste for the idea that God's electing love is limited to some and denied to others.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Chesterton noted that only a man who had "escaped" Calvinism could say that God is easy to please and hard to satisfy.{{clarify|date=June 2021}}{{sfn|Greville, Intro}}

MacDonald rejected the doctrine of [[penal substitution]]ary atonement as developed by [[John Calvin]], which argues that Christ has taken the place of sinners and is punished by the wrath of God in their place, believing that in turn it raised serious questions about the character and nature of God.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Instead, he taught that Christ had come to save people from their sins, and not from a Divine penalty for their sins: the problem was not the need to appease a wrathful God, but the disease of cosmic evil itself.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} MacDonald frequently described the [[atonement in Christianity|atonement]] in terms similar to the [[Christus Victor]] theory.{{clarify|date=March 2017}}{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} MacDonald posed the rhetorical question, "Did he not foil and slay evil by letting all the waves and billows of its horrid sea break upon him, go over him, and die without rebound—spend their rage, fall defeated, and cease?

MacDonald declared, "I believe that no hell will be lacking which would help the just mercy of God to redeem his children."<ref>{{cite book | author = Johnson, Joseph | year = 1906 | title =George MacDonald: A Biographical and Critical Appreciation | page = [https://archive.org/details/georgemacdonaldb00johnuoft/page/155 155] | publisher = Sir Isaac Pitman & Sons, Ltd. | url = https://archive.org/details/georgemacdonaldb00johnuoft | access-date = 15 March 2017}}</ref> MacDonald posed the rhetorical question, "When we say that God is Love, do we teach men that their fear of Him is groundless?"  He replied, "No. As much as they were will come upon them, possibly far more.&nbsp;... The wrath will consume what they ''call'' themselves; so that the selves God made shall appear."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Phillips |first1=Michael R. |year=1987 |title=George MacDonald: Scotland's Beloved Storyteller |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TobyAAAAMAAJ&q=%22wrath+will+consume%22 |location=Minneapolis |publisher=Bethany House |page=202 |isbn=978-0871239440 |access-date=14 September 2017 }}</ref>

However, true repentance, in the sense of freely chosen moral growth, is essential to this process, and, in MacDonald's optimistic view, inevitable for all beings (see [[universal reconciliation]]).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

MacDonald states his theological views most distinctly in the sermon "Justice", found in the third volume of ''Unspoken Sermons''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/macdonald/unspoken3.viii.html |title=Sermon "Justice", at ''Unspoken Sermons Third Series'' |publisher=Christian Classics Ethereal Library |access-date=19 June 2018}}</ref>
