[[File:Edward Herbert 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury by Larkin.jpg|thumb|Edward Herbert, by [[William Larkin (painter)|William Larkin]], c.1609–10]]

'''Edward Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury''' (or '''Chirbury''') [[Knight of the Bath|KB]] (3 March 1583<ref>{{Britannica|262735}}</ref> – 5 August 1648<ref>Herbert's date of death has been the source of confusion. The date 5 August appears in the burial registers of [[St Giles in the Fields]], and is corroborated by independent documentary evidence. However, his tombstone, erected some years later, apparently bore the date 20 August, and this date was subsequently accepted by many biographers. It is now believed to have been an error: see {{cite journal |last=Roberts |first=Dunstan |title=The death of Lord Herbert of Cherbury revisited |journal=Notes and Queries |volume=63 |issue=1 |year=2016 |pages=44–45 |doi=10.1093/notesj/gjv228 }}</ref>) was an [[Anglo-Welsh]] soldier, diplomat, historian, poet and religious philosopher of the [[Kingdom of England]].

==Life==

===Early life===
Edward Herbert was the eldest son of [[Richard Herbert, Lord of Cherbury|Richard Herbert]] of [[Montgomery Castle]] (a member of a collateral branch of the family of the [[Earl of Pembroke|Earls of Pembroke]]) and of [[Magdelen Herbert|Magdalen]], daughter of [[Richard Newport (died 1570)|Sir Richard Newport]],<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |wstitle=Herbert of Cherbury, Edward Herbert, Baron |volume=13| pages=340–341 |inline=1}}</ref> and brother of the poet [[George Herbert]]. He was born within England at [[Eyton-on-Severn]] near [[Wroxeter]], [[Shropshire]]. After private tuition, he matriculated at [[University College, Oxford]], as a [[gentleman commoner]], in May 1596. On 28 February 1599, at the age of 15, he married his cousin Mary, then aged 21, ("notwithstanding the disparity of years betwixt us"<ref>''Autobiography''.</ref>), who was daughter and heiress of [[William Herbert (MP died 1593)|Sir William Herbert]] (d. 1593). He returned to [[Oxford, England|Oxford]] with his wife and mother, continued his studies, and learned French, Italian and Spanish, as well as music, riding and fencing.<ref name=EB1911/> During this period, before he was 21, he started a family.

Herbert entered Parliament as [[knight of the shire]] for [[Montgomeryshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Montgomeryshire]] in 1601. On the accession of [[James I of England|King James I]] he presented himself at court and was created a [[Knight of the Bath]] on 24 July 1603.<ref name=EB1911/> From 1604 to 1611 he was Member of Parliament for [[Merioneth (UK Parliament constituency)|Merioneth]].<ref name="Bedford, p. 2">Bedford, p. 2.</ref> From 1605 he was magistrate and appointed [[High Sheriff of Montgomeryshire|sheriff of Montgomeryshire]] for 1605.<ref>[https://biography.wales/article/s-HERB-EDW-1583 ''Welsh Biography Online'']</ref>

In 1608, Edward Herbert went to Paris, with [[Aurelian Townshend]], enjoying the friendship and hospitality of the old [[Henri Ier de Montmorency|Constable de Montmorency]] at [[Merlou]] and meeting [[Henry IV of France|King Henry IV]]; he lodged for many months with [[Isaac Casaubon]].<ref name="Bedford, p. 2"/> On his return, as he wrote of himself, he was "in great esteem both in court and city, many of the greatest desiring my company".<ref name=EB1911/> At this period he was close to both [[Ben Jonson]] and [[John Donne]], and in Jonson's ''[[Epicoene, or the Silent Woman]]'' Herbert is probably alluded to.<ref>Richard Dutton (editor), ''Epicene, Or, The Silent Woman: By Ben Jonson'' (2003), p. 10.</ref> Both Donne and Jonson honoured him in poetry.<ref>Bedford, pp. 10–11.</ref> In December 1609 he fought with a Scottish usher at [[Greenwich Palace]] who had snatched a ribbon from [[Mary Middlemore]]'s hair, and if the Privy Council had not prevented it, would have fought a duel in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]].<ref>Edward Herbert, ''The Life of Edward Lord Herbert of Cherbury'' (London, 1826),  pp. 108-9: Norman Egbert McClure, ''Letters of John Chamberlain'', vol. 1 (Philadelphia, 1939), p. 296.</ref>

In 1610 Herbert served as a volunteer in the [[Low Countries]] under the [[Prince of Orange]], whose intimate friend he became, and distinguished himself at the capture of [[Juliers]] from the emperor. He offered to decide the war by engaging in single combat with a champion chosen from among the enemy, but his challenge was declined. Back in England in 1611 he survived an assault in London by [[John Eyre (died 1639)|Sir John Eyre]] who accused him of having an affair with his wife [[Dorothy Bulstrode]]. He paid a visit to [[Ambrosio Spinola, marqués de los Balbases|Spinola]], in the Spanish camp near [[Wezel]], and afterwards to the [[elector palatine]] at [[Heidelberg]], subsequently travelling in Italy. At the instance of the [[Duke of Savoy]] he led an expedition of 4,000 [[Huguenots]] from [[Languedoc]] into [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]] to help the Savoyards against Spain, but after nearly losing his life in the journey to [[Lyon]] he was imprisoned on his arrival there, and the enterprise came to nothing. Thence he returned to the [[Netherlands]] and the Prince of Orange, arriving in England in 1617.<ref name=EB1911/>

===Diplomat===
In 1619, Herbert was made ambassador to Paris, taking in his entourage [[Thomas Carew]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poet.html?id=81305|title=Thomas Carew|date=23 October 2021}}</ref> He became involved with the case of [[Piero Hugon]] who had stolen jewels belonging to Anne of Denmark.<ref>Sidney Lee, ''Autobiography of Edward, Lord Herbert of Cherbury'' (London, 1886), p. 343.</ref> A quarrel with [[Charles de Luynes|de Luynes]] and a challenge sent by him to the latter occasioned his recall in 1621. After the death of de Luynes, Herbert resumed his post in February 1622.<ref name=EB1911/>

He was popular at the French [[Noble court|court]] and showed considerable diplomatic ability. His chief objects were to accomplish the marriage between [[Charles I of England|Charles, Prince of Wales]] and [[Henrietta Maria]], and to secure the assistance of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] for [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]]. He failed in the latter, and was dismissed in April 1624.<ref name=EB1911/>

Herbert returned home greatly in debt and received little reward for his services beyond the Irish peerage of Baron Herbert of [[Castleisland|Castle Island]] on 31 May 1624 and the English barony of Herbert of Cherbury, or [[Chirbury]], on 7 May 1629.<ref name=EB1911/>

===Later life===
In 1632, Herbert was appointed a member of the council of war. He attended the king at [[York]] in 1639, and in May 1642 was imprisoned by the parliament for urging the addition of the words "without cause" to the resolution that the king violated his oath by making war on parliament. He determined after this to take no further part in the struggle, retired to [[Montgomery Castle]], and declined the king's summons,<ref name=EB1911/> pleading ill-health.

On 5 September 1644 he surrendered the castle, by negotiation, to the Parliamentary forces led by [[Thomas Myddelton (younger)|Sir Thomas Myddelton]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=37605|title = House of Lords Journal Volume 6: 23 September 1644 &#124; British History Online}}</ref> He returned to London, submitted, and was granted a pension of £20 a week. In 1647 he paid a visit to [[Pierre Gassendi]] at Paris, and died in London the following summer, aged 65, being buried in the church of [[St Giles in the Fields]].<ref name=EB1911/>

===Family===
Lord Herbert left two sons, [[Richard Herbert, 2nd Baron Herbert of Chirbury|Richard]] (c. 1600–1655), who succeeded him as [[Baron Herbert of Cherbury|2nd Lord Herbert of Cherbury]], and Edward. Richard's sons, [[Edward Herbert, 3rd Baron Herbert of Chirbury|Edward Herbert]] (d.1678) and [[Henry Herbert, 4th Baron Herbert of Chirbury|Henry Herbert]] (d.1691), each succeeded to the title, after which it became extinct. It was revived in 1694 when [[Henry Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Chirbury|Henry Herbert]] (1654–1709), son of Sir [[Henry Herbert (Master of the Revels)|Henry Herbert]] (1595–1673), brother of the 1st Lord Herbert,<ref name=EB1911/> was created Lord Herbert of Cherbury. Lord Herbert's cousin and namesake, Sir [[Edward Herbert (attorney-general)|Edward Herbert]], was also a prominent figure in the [[English Civil War]].

==''De Veritate''==
Herbert's major work is the ''[[De Veritate]], prout distinguitur a revelatione, a verisimili, a possibili, et a falso<ref name=EB1911/> (On Truth, as It Is Distinguished from Revelation, the Probable, the Possible, and the False)''<ref>''On Truth, as it is Distinguished from Revelation, the Probable, the Possible, and the False'') (Paris, 1624; London, 1633; translated into French in 1639 and into English in 1937.</ref> He published it on the advice of [[Grotius]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/h/herbert.htm|title = Herbert of Cherbury, Edward &#124; Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref>

In the ''De Veritate'', Herbert produced the first purely [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] treatise, written by an Englishman. Herbert's real claim to fame is as "the father of English [[Deism]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.covenantseminary.edu/worldwide/en/CC310/CC310_T_24.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-09-20 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807174913/http://www.covenantseminary.edu/worldwide/en/CC310/CC310_T_24.html |archive-date=7 August 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The common notions of religion are the famous five articles, which became the charter of the English deists.<ref name=EB1911/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/d/deismeng.htm|title=Deism, English &#124; Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sullivan-county.com/nf0/|title = English Deists Lord Herbert of Cherbury}}</ref> [[Charles Blount (deist)|Charles Blount]], in particular, acted as a publicist for Herbert's idea.

==Other works==
[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - Lord Herbert of Cherbury.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|Lord Herbert of Cherbury by [[Wenceslaus Hollar]]]]
The ''De religione gentilium''<ref>Completed 1645, published Amsterdam, 1663, translated into English by William Lewis, London, 1705.</ref> was a posthumously published work, influenced by the ''De theologia gentili'' of [[Gerardus Vossius]], and seen into print by [[Isaac Vossius]]. It is an early work on [[comparative religion]], and gives, in [[David Hume]]'s words, "a natural history of religion." It is also to some extent dependent on the ''De dis Syris'' of [[John Selden]], and the ''Quaestiones celeberrimae in Genesim'' of [[Marin Mersenne]].<ref>Bedford, p. 179.</ref> By examining pagan religions Herbert finds the universality of his five great articles, and that these are clearly recognisable. The same vein is maintained in the tracts ''De causis errorum'', an unfinished work on logical fallacies, ''Religio laici'', and ''Ad sacerdotes de religione laici'' (1645).<ref name=EB1911/>

Herbert's first historical work was the ''Expedition Buckinghami ducis'',<ref>Published in a Latin translation in 1656 and in the original English by the [[Earl of Powis]] for the [[Philobiblon Society]] in 1860.</ref> a defence of the [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]]'s conduct on the [[La Rochelle expedition]] of 1627. ''The Life and Raigne of King Henry VIII'' (1649)<ref name=EB1911/> is considered good for its period, but hampered by limited sources.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://historymedren.about.com/od/hentries/a/11_henryviii_4.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=7 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302184953/http://historymedren.about.com/od/hentries/a/11_henryviii_4.htm |archive-date=2 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

His poems, published in 1665 (reprinted and edited by [[John Churton Collins]] in 1881), show him in general a faithful disciple of Donne. His satires are poor, but a few of his lyrical verses show power of reflection and true inspiration, while his use of the metre afterwards employed by [[Alfred Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]] in his "In Memoriam" is particularly happy and effective. His [[New Latin language|Neo-Latin]] poems are evidence of his scholarship. Three of these had appeared together with the ''De causis errorum'' in 1645.

To these works must be added ''A Dialogue between a Tutor and a Pupil'',<ref>1768; a treatise on education, manuscript in the [[Bodleian Library]].</ref> which is of disputed authenticity;<ref>Upheld by Günter Gawlick in his 1971 facsimile edition, after this had been cast in doubt by Rossi.</ref> and a treatise on the king's supremacy in the Church (manuscript in the Record Office and at [[the Queen's College, Oxford]]). His autobiography, first published by [[Horace Walpole]] in 1764, a naïve and amusing narrative, is much occupied with his duels and amorous adventures, and breaks off in 1624. Missing from it are his friendships and the diplomatic side of his embassy in France, in relation to which he described only the splendour of his retinue and his social triumphs.<ref name=EB1911/>

He was a [[lutenist]], and his collection ''Lord Herbert of Cherbury's Lute-Book'' survives in manuscript.<ref>http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~wbc/julia/ch7/7a.htm {{Bare URL inline|date=June 2021}}</ref> His own compositions, in all four preludes, four pavans and a courante, are conservative in style, showing little influence from the works of the French school that appear in his collection.<ref>{{Cite Grove |title=Herbert, Edward, Lord of Cherbury and Castle Island |first=Diana |last=Poulton |first2=Robert |last2=Spencer |date=2001 |url=https://doi.org/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.12831}}</ref>

==Herbert of Cherbury's views of prayer==

 }}</ref> has shown that Herbert was one of the most pious of the deists, as he fervently prayed to God and believed God gave signs in answer to our prayers. He was so sure God answered our prayers that he said prayer was an idea God put into every human. He said that:

{{quote|every religion believes that the Deity can hear and answer prayers; and we are bound to assume a special Providence—to omit other sources of proof—from the universal testimony of the sense of divine assistance in times of distress.<ref>Herbert, ''De Veritate'', 292–94, as cited in Waligore p. 189.</ref>}}

For Herbert, this universal testimony of God answering our prayers meant that it was a common notion or something engraved into our heart by God.

Herbert was speaking from experience. In his autobiography, Herbert said he once prayed for and received a divine sign. He had written ''De Veritate'' and was wondering whether he should publish it. So he got down on his knees and prayed fervently to God for a sign instructing him what to do. Even though it was a clear, sunny day with no wind, Herbert said he heard a gentle noise in the clear sky that so comforted him that he decided it was a sign from God that he should publish his book. Herbert wrote:

{{quote|Being thus doubtful in my Chamber, one fair day in the Summer, my Casement being opened towards the South, the Sun shining clear and no Wind stirring, I took my book, ''De Veritate'', in my hand, and, kneeling on my Knees, devoutly said these words: "O Thou Eternal God, Author of the Light which now shines upon me, and Giver of all inward Illuminations, I do beseech Thee, of Thy infinite Goodness, to pardon a greater Request than a Sinner ought to make; I am not satisfied enough whether I shall publish this Book, ''De Veritate''; if it be for Thy glory, I beseech Thee give me some Sign from Heaven, if not, I shall suppress it." I had no sooner spoken these words, but a loud 'tho yet gentle Noise came from the Heavens (for it was like nothing on Earth) which did so comfort and cheer me, that I took my Petition as granted, and that I had the Sign I demanded, whereupon also I resolved to print my Book.<ref>Herbert, ''The Life of Edward Lord Herbert of Cherbury'' (Dublin, 1771), 244–245, as cited in Waligore p. 189.</ref>}}

Herbert was attacked by orthodox Protestant ministers of the eighteenth century as a religious enthusiast. One minister, John Brown, said his claim to have received a sign from God was "enthusiastic".<ref>John Brown, ''A General History of the Christian Church'', 2 vols. (Edinburgh, 1771), 2: 278.</ref> Another minister, [[John Leland (Presbyterian)|John Leland]], said even asking for such a sign was improper, as God does not become involved like that in people’s lives.  Leland said that Herbert’s claim "passed for a high fit of enthusiasm. ... I think it maybe justly doubted, whether an address of such a particular kind, as that made by his Lordship, was proper or regular.  It does not seem to me, that we are well-founded to apply for or to expect an extraordinary sign from heaven."<ref>John Leland, ''A View of the Principal Deistical Writers'', 3rd ed., 3 vols. (1757; reprint, New York: Garland, 1978), 1:25.</ref> Clearly these two eighteenth-century Christian commentators did not see Herbert's understanding of God as distant and uninvolved. Rather, Herbert was attacked for believing in an overly-involved deity who had an overly-intimate relationship with people.

Modern scholars of deism often have difficulty fitting Herbert's religious views into their scheme of what deists believed. For example, [[Peter Gay]] said that Herbert—who lived in the early seventeenth century—was atypical of the later deists because Herbert thought he had received a divine sign<ref>Peter Gay, ''Deism: An Anthology'' (Princeton: D. Van Nostrand Company, Inc., 1968), 30, 53.</ref> but Waligore argues that instead of saying Herbert was not a deist, we should change our notions about the deists and their relationship to God through prayer.<ref>Waligore 2012.</ref>

Besides believing in prayers and divine signs, Herbert also believed in miracles, revelation, and direct divine inspiration. Herbert was so sure God performed miracles that he thought this doctrine, and the related notion that God answered our prayers, was an idea God put into every human.<ref>Herbert, ''De Veritate'', 292–294, as cited in Waligore p. 189.</ref> Herbert said his emphasis on natural religion did not mean revelation was superfluous. He said he thought the Bible was a "surer source of consolation and support" than any other book and reading it stirred "the whole inner man" to life.<ref>Herbert, ''De Veritate'', 316, as cited in Waligore, p. 196.</ref> Herbert thought that divine inspiration generally happened through "the medium of spirits ... variously called angels, demons, intelligences and geniuses".<ref>Herbert of Cherbury, ''De Veritate'', trans. Meyrick H. Carre (Bristol: J. W. Arrowsmith, 1937), 308–309.</ref> He said that we could be sure we had divine inspiration if we prepared ourselves for it and it met certain conditions. To begin with, said Herbert, "we must employ prayers, vows, faith and every faculty which can be used to invoke" the divine. Then "the breath of the Divine Spirit must be immediately felt" and the recommended course of action must be good. When these conditions were met, "and we feel the Divine guidance in our activities, we must recognize with reverence the good will of God".<ref>Herbert of Cherbury, ''De Veritate'', 308–9, as cited in Waligore p. 186.</ref>
