'''Uroš Petrović''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Урош Петровић}}, born 8 April 1967) is a [[Serbs|Serbian]] writer. 

==Biography==
Petrović is born in [[Gornji Milanovac]], [[Socialist Republic of Serbia]] within [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], now [[Serbia]]. Exercising one’s brain, meeting with the wondrous, strange, but also terrifying, the unbridled imagination and special humor in his books are all also becoming increasingly popular reading for adults.
He is best known for his unusual novels, ''Riddle Tales I - V'' (Original title – ''Zagonetne priče'') serial, ''Mysteries of Ginkgo Street'' (Original title – ''Misterije Ginkove ulice'') and the first Serbian horror for children '' The Fifth Butterfly'' (Original title – ''Peti leptir''). ''Dark Secrets of Ginkgo Street'' and ''Marta's Great Mysterious Adventure'' are also an innovative form - ''novels made of riddles''. Petrovic spurred the nation to think in the “Labyrinth” quiz as the Creator of the Labyrinth character and the most serious obstacle for competitors, broadcast by Radio Television of Serbia. Awarded for books and photographs. Chairman of Serbian Mensa (2008. - 2013.).<ref>[[List of Mensans]]</ref> Founder of Mensa World Photo Cup.<ref>http://www.mensa.rs/en/photocup/history/</ref>
