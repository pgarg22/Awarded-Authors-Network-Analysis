'''René Char''' ({{IPA-fr|ʃaʁ|lang}}; 14 June 1907&nbsp;– 19 February 1988) was a French poet and member of the French Resistance.

==Biography==
Char was born in [[L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue]] in the [[Vaucluse]] department of France,<ref name="ClasseAC024686812000">{{cite book|author1=O. Classe|author2=[Anonymus AC02468681]|title=Encyclopedia of Literary Translation Into English: A-L|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=myLDA0_brhcC&pg=PA262|year=2000|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-884964-36-7|pages=262}}</ref> the youngest of the four children of Emile Char and Marie-Thérèse Rouget, where his father was mayor and managing director of the Vaucluse plasterworks. He spent his childhood in Névons, the substantial family home completed at his birth, then studied as a boarder at the school of [[Avignon]] and subsequently, in 1925, a student at ''L'École de Commerce de Marseille'', where he read [[Plutarch]], [[François Villon]], [[Jean Racine|Racine]], the [[German Romantics]], [[Alfred de Vigny]], [[Gérard de Nerval]] and [[Charles Baudelaire]]. He was tall (1.92&nbsp;m) and was an active [[Rugby football|rugby]] player. After briefly working at [[Cavaillon]], in 1927 he performed his military service in the artillery in [[Nîmes]].

Char's first book, ''Cloches sur le cœur'' was published in 1928 as a compilation of poems written between 1922 and 1926.<ref name="ClasseAC024686812000"/> In early 1929, he founded the journal ''Méridiens'' with [[André Cayatte]] and published three issues. In August, he sent twenty-six copies of his book ''Arsenal'', published in Nîmes, to [[Paul Éluard]], who in the autumn came to visit him at L'Isle sur la Sorgue. In late November, Char moved to Paris, where he met [[Louis Aragon]], [[André Breton]], and [[René Crevel]], and joined the [[Surrealism|surrealists]]. His "''Profession de foi du sujet''" was published in December in the twelfth issue of ''La Révolution surréaliste''. He remained active in the surrealist movement through the early 1930s but distanced himself gradually from the mid-1930s onward. Throughout his career, Char's work appeared in various editions, often with artwork by notable figures, including [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]], [[Picasso]], [[Braque]], [[Miró]], [[Matisse]] and [[Vieira da Silva]].

Char joined the [[French Resistance]] in 1940, serving under the name of Captain Alexandre, where he commanded the [[Durance]] parachute drop zone. He refused to publish anything during the Occupation, but wrote the "Feuillets d'Hypnos" during it (1943–1944), prose poems dealing with resistance. These were published in 1946 to great acclaim. During the 1950s and 1960s, despite brief and unhappy experiences in theater and film, Char reached full maturity as a poet. In the 1960s, he joined the battle against the stationing of [[atomic weapons]] in [[Provence]]. He died of a heart attack in 1988 in Paris. The Hotel Campredon (also known as the Maison René Char) in [[L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue]] was a public collection of his manuscripts, drawings, paintings and objets d'art, until 2016.

Char was a friend and close associate of the writers [[Albert Camus]],<ref>[http://www.citedulivre-aix.com/Typo3/fileadmin/documents/RendezVous/juin-juillet/Bulletin_Mejanes-juin_juill_2007.pdf juin_juill:Mise en page 1<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name="ClasseAC024686812000"/> [[Georges Bataille]] and [[Maurice Blanchot]], and of the artists [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Joan Miró]] and [[Victor Brauner]]. He was to have been in the car involved in the accident that killed both Camus and Michel Gallimard, but there was not enough room, and returned instead that day by train to Paris.

The composer [[Pierre Boulez]] wrote three settings of Char's poetry, ''[[Le Soleil des eaux]]'', ''[[Le Visage nuptial]]'', and ''[[Le Marteau sans maître]]''. A late friendship developed also between Char and [[Martin Heidegger]], who described Char's poetry as "a tour de force into the ineffable" and was repeatedly his guest at [[Le Thor]] in the [[Vaucluse]].<ref>Rüdiger Safranski, ''Ein Meister aus Deutschland. Heidegger und seine Zeit'', 1994. Ch. 23.</ref>
