'''Franz Viktor Werfel''' ({{IPA-de|fʁant͡s ˈvɛʁfl̩|lang|De-Franz Werfel.ogg}}; 10 September 1890 &ndash; 26 August 1945) was an [[Austria]]n-[[Bohemia]]n [[novelist]], [[playwright]], and [[Poetry|poet]] whose career spanned [[World War I]], the [[Interwar period]], and [[World War II]]. He is primarily known as the author of ''[[The Forty Days of Musa Dagh]]'' (1933, English tr. 1934, 2012), a novel based on events that took place during the [[Armenian genocide]] of 1915, and ''[[The Song of Bernadette (novel)|The Song of Bernadette]]'' (1941), a novel about the life and visions of the French Catholic saint [[Bernadette Soubirous]], which was made into a Hollywood film of the same [[The Song of Bernadette (film)|name]].

== Life and career ==
Born in [[Prague]] (then part of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]), Werfel was the first of three children of a wealthy manufacturer of gloves and leather goods, Rudolf Werfel. His mother, Albine Kussi, was the daughter of a mill owner. His two sisters were [[Hanna Fuchs-Robettin|Hanna]] (born 1896) and Marianne Amalie (born 1899).<ref name="Jungk">{{Cite book |last=Jungk |first=Peter Stephan |url=https://archive.org/details/franzwerfellifei00jung |title=Franz Werfel: A Life in Prague, Vienna, & Hollywood |publisher=Grove Weidenfeld |year=1990 |isbn=0-8021-1097-5 |location=New York |translator-last=Anselm Hollo |author-link=Peter Stephan Jungk |translator-link=Anselm Hollo |url-access=registration}}</ref> His family was [[Jews|Jew]]ish. As a child, Werfel was raised by his Czech Catholic governess, Barbara Šimůnková, who often took him to mass in Prague's main cathedral. Like the children of other progressive German-speaking Jews in Prague, Werfel was educated at a Catholic school run by the [[Piarists]], a teaching order that allowed for a [[rabbi]] to instruct Jewish students for their [[Bar Mitzvahs]].<ref name=Jungk /> This, along with his governess's influence, gave Werfel an early interest (and expertise) in [[Catholicism]], which soon branched out to other faiths, including [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and [[Islam]], such that his fiction, as well as his nonfiction, provides some insight into [[comparative religion]].

Werfel began writing at an early age and, by 1911, had published his first book of poems, ''Der Weltfreund'', which can be translated as "the friend to the world" as well as philanthropist, humanitarian, and the like.<ref name=Jungk /> By this time, Werfel had befriended other German Jewish writers who frequented Prague's {{ill|Café Arco|de|Café Arco|cs|Kavárna Arco}}, chief among them [[Max Brod]] and [[Franz Kafka]], and his poetry was praised by such critics as [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]], who published Werfel's early poems in Kraus's journal, ''Die Fackel'' (The Torch). In 1912, Werfel moved to Leipzig, where he became an editor for [[Kurt Wolff (publisher)|Kurt Wolff]]'s new publishing firm, where Werfel championed and edited [[Georg Trakl]]'s first book of poetry. While he lived in Germany, Werfel's milieu grew to include [[Else Lasker-Schüler]], [[Martin Buber]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], among other German-language writers, poets, and intellectuals in the first decades of the twentieth century.

With the outbreak of World War I, Werfel served in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Russian front]]<ref name="ushmm">[http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007049 "Franz Werfel", U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum]</ref> as a telephone operator. His duties both exposed him to the vicissitudes of [[total war]] as well as provided him with enough of a haven to continue writing [[Expressionist]] poems, ambitious plays, and letters voluminously. His eclectic mix of [[humanism]], [[confessionalism (poetry)|confessionalism]], autobiography, as well as mythology and religiosity developed further during this time. His poems and plays ranged from scenes of ancient Egypt (notably the [[monotheism]] of [[Akhenaton]]) to occult allusions (Werfel had participated in séances with his friends Brod and Kafka) and incorporate a parable from the [[Baháʼí Faith]] in the poem "Jesus and the Carrion Path". His bias for Christian subjects, as well as his antipathy for Zionism, eventually alienated many of his Jewish friends and readers, including early champions such as Karl Kraus. Others, however, stood by him, including, Martin Buber, who published a sequence of poems from Werfel's wartime manuscript, ''Der Gerichtstag'' (Judgment Day, published in 1919) in his monthly journal, ''Der Jude'' (''The Jew''). and wrote of Werfel in his prefatory remark:

<blockquote>Since I was first moved by his poems, I have opened (knowing well, I should say, it's a problem) the gates of my invisible garden [i.e., an [[imaginarium]]] to him, and now he can do nothing for all eternity that would bring me to banish him from it. Compare, if you will, a real person to an anecdotal one, a late book to an earlier, the one you see to you yourself; but I am not putting a value on a poet, only recognizing that he is one—and the way he is one.<ref>[[Martin Buber]], "Vorbemerkung über Franz Werfel", ''Der Jude'' 2, nos. 1–2 (April–May 1917): 109–112.</ref></blockquote>

In the summer of 1917, Werfel left the frontline for the Military Press Bureau in Vienna, where he joined other notable Austrian writers serving as propagandists, among them [[Robert Musil]], Rilke, [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]], and [[Franz Blei]]. Through the latter, Werfel met and fell in love with [[Alma Mahler]], widow of [[Gustav Mahler]], the former lover of the painter [[Oskar Kokoschka]], and the wife of the [[architect]] [[Walter Gropius]], then serving in the Imperial German Army on the Western Front. Alma, who was also a composer, had already set one of Werfel's poems to music, reciprocated despite Werfel being much younger, shorter, and having Jewish features that she, being both anti-Semitic and attracted to Jewish men, initially found distasteful.<ref name=Jungk /> Their love affair culminated in the premature birth of a son, Martin, in August 1918. Martin, who was given the surname of Gropius, died in May of the following year. Despite attempts to save his marriage to Alma, with whom he had a young daughter, [[Manon Gropius|Manon]], Gropius reluctantly agreed to a divorce in 1920. Ironically, Alma refused to marry Werfel for the next nine years.<ref name=Jungk /> However, Alma, more so than with her first two husbands and lovers, lent herself to the development of Werfel's career and influenced it in such a way that he became an accomplished playwright and novelist as well as poet. They married on 6 July 1929.

In April 1924, ''Verdi – Roman der Oper'' (Novel of the Opera) was published by Zsolnay Verlag, establishing Werfel's reputation as a novelist. In 1926, Werfel was awarded the Grillparzer Prize by the Austrian Academy of Sciences, and in Berlin, [[Max Reinhardt]] performed his play ''Juarez and Maximilian'' (depicting  the struggle in 1860's [[Mexico]] between the Republican leader [[Benito Juárez]] and the French-backed [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Emperor Maximilian]]). By the end of the decade, Werfel had become one of the most important and established writers in German and Austrian literature and had already merited one full-length critical biography.

A journey in 1930 to the Middle East and encountering starving refugees inspired his novel ''[[The Forty Days of Musa Dagh]]'' which drew world attention to the [[Armenian genocide]] at the hands of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman government]].<ref>James Reidel, "Translator's note" in Franz Werfel, ''The Forty Days of Musa Dagh'', trans. Geoffrey Dunlop and James Reidel (1934; revised and expanded, New York: Godine, 2012).</ref> Werfel lectured on this subject across Germany. The Nazi newspaper ''[[Das Schwarze Korps]]'' denounced him as a propagandist of "alleged Turkish horrors perpetrated against the Armenians". The same newspaper, suggesting a link between the Armenian and the later Jewish genocide, condemned "America's Armenian Jews for promoting in the U.S.A. the sale of Werfel's book".<ref>[[Robert Fisk]], ''[[The Great War for Civilisation]]: The Conquest of the Middle East'', (New York: Knopf, 2006), 231.</ref>

Werfel was forced to leave the [[Prussian Academy of Arts]] in 1933. His books were burned by the Nazis.<ref name=ushmm/> Werfel left Austria after the [[Anschluss]] in 1938 and went to France, where they lived in a fishing village near Marseille. Visitors to their home at this time included [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Thomas Mann]]. After the German invasion and occupation of France during World War II, and the deportation of French Jews to the [[Nazi concentration camps]], Werfel had to flee again. With the assistance of [[Varian Fry]] and the Emergency Rescue Committee in [[Marseille]], he and his wife narrowly escaped the Nazi regime,<ref name=Jungk /> finding shelter for five weeks in the pilgrimage town of Lourdes.<ref name=ushmm/> He also received much help and kindness from the Catholic orders that staffed the shrine.<ref name=Jungk /> He vowed to write about the experience and, safe in America, he published ''[[The Song of Bernadette (novel)|The Song of Bernadette]]'' in 1941.<ref>Personal Preface, ''Song of Bernadette'', Werfel, Franz</ref>

Fry organized a secret crossing over the Pyrenees on foot. They went to Madrid and then traveled on to Portugal. They stayed in Monte Estoril, at the Grande Hotel D'Itália, between 8 September and 4 October 1940.<ref>[[Exiles Memorial Center]].</ref> On the same day they checked out, they boarded the ''S.S. Nea Hellas'' headed for New York City, arriving on 13 October.<ref>Ellis Island Passenger Registration Records.</ref>

Werfel and his family settled in Los Angeles, where they met other German and Austrian emigrants, such as Mann, Reinhardt, and [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold]]. In southern California, Werfel wrote his final play, ''Jacobowsky and the Colonel'' (''Jacobowsky und der Oberst'') which was made into the 1958 film ''[[Me and the Colonel]]'' starring [[Danny Kaye]]; [[Giselher Klebe]]'s [[opera]] ''[[Jacobowsky und der Oberst (opera)|Jacobowsky und der Oberst]]'' (1965) is also based on this play. Before his death, he completed the first draft of his last novel ''Star of the Unborn'' (''Stern der Ungeborenen''), which was published posthumously in 1946.<ref name=Jungk />

Franz Werfel died of heart failure in Los Angeles in 1945 and was interred there in the [[Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery|Rosedale Cemetery]]. However, his body was returned in 1975 to Vienna for reburial in the [[Zentralfriedhof]].<ref>[http://www.lehrer.uni-karlsruhe.de/~za874/homepage/werfel.htm Franz Werfel – timeline and works] {{in lang|de}}</ref>
