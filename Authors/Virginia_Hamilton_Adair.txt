==Career==
Though she published work during the 1930s and 1940s in ''[[Saturday Review (US magazine)|Saturday Review]]'', ''[[The Atlantic]]'', and ''[[The New Republic]]'', Adair did not publish again for almost 50 years. There were several factors which preoccupied her over those decades and took her attention away from publishing her own work. These included her 1936 marriage to prominent historian [[Douglass Adair]],<ref name=":0" /> motherhood (she had three children),<ref name=":0" /> and an academic career. She was also soured on publishing her work due to her distaste for the gamesmanship of the publishing world.

Adair's return to publishing came in the 1990s, following her husband's 1968 suicide,<ref name=":0" /> her retirement from teaching, and her loss of sight from [[glaucoma]]. Adair's friend and fellow poet [[Robert Mezey]] forwarded some of her work to [[Alice Quinn]], ''[[The New Yorker]]'''s poetry editor. ''The New Yorker'' published the work in 1995, and the subsequently published "Ants on the Melon".  Adair's work then appeared regularly in ''The New Yorker'' and ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''.
