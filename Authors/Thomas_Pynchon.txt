His [[fiction]] and non-fiction writings encompass a vast array of subject matter, [[Literary genre|genres]] and [[Theme (narrative)|themes]], including [[history]], [[music]], [[science]], and [[mathematics]]. For ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]'', Pynchon won the 1973 U.S. [[National Book Award for Fiction]].<ref name=nba1974>

Hailing from [[Long Island]], Pynchon served two years in the [[United States Navy]] and earned an English degree from [[Cornell University]]. After publishing several short stories in the late 1950s and early 1960s, he began composing the novels for which he is best known: ''[[V.]]'' (1963), ''[[The Crying of Lot 49]]'' (1966), and ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]'' (1973). His 2009 novel ''[[Inherent Vice]]'' was adapted into a [[Inherent Vice (film)|feature film of the same name]] by director [[Paul Thomas Anderson]] in 2014. Pynchon is notoriously [[Recluse|reclusive]] from the media; few photographs of him have been published, and rumors about his location and identity have circulated since the 1960s. Pynchon's most recent novel, ''[[Bleeding Edge (novel)|Bleeding Edge]]'', was published on September 17, 2013.

Thomas Pynchon was born on May 8, 1937, in [[Glen Cove, New York|Glen Cove]], [[Long Island]], New York,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Krafft|first=John M.|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1lshMpwOA4wC&pg=PA10|title=The Cambridge Companion to Thomas Pynchon|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-76974-7|editor-last=Dalsgaard|editor-first=Inger H.|pages=10|language=en|chapter=Biographical note|editor-last2=Herman|editor-first2=Luc|editor-last3=McHale|editor-first3=Brian}}</ref> one of three children of engineer and politician Thomas Ruggles Pynchon Sr. (1907–1995) and Katherine Frances Bennett (1909–1996), a nurse. His earliest American ancestor, [[William Pynchon]], emigrated to the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] with the [[Winthrop Fleet]] in 1630, then became the founder of [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], in 1636, and thereafter a long line of Pynchon descendants found wealth and repute on American soil. Aspects of Pynchon's ancestry and family background have partially inspired his fiction writing, particularly in the Slothrop family histories related in the short story "[[Slow Learner|The Secret Integration]]" (1984) and ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]'' (1973). During his childhood, Pynchon alternatively attended [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] services with his father and [[Roman Catholic]] services with his mother.<ref name="vulture.com">{{Cite web|title=On the Thomas Pynchon Trail: From the Long Island of His Boyhood to the 'Yupper West Side' of His New Novel|url=https://www.vulture.com/2013/08/thomas-pynchon-bleeding-edge.html|last=Kachka|first=Boris|date=August 25, 2013|website=Vulture|access-date=February 12, 2020}}</ref>

===Education and military career===
A "voracious reader and precocious writer," Pynchon is believed to have [[Grade skipping|skipped]] two grades before high school.<ref name="vulture.com"/> Pynchon attended [[Oyster Bay High School]] in [[Oyster Bay (hamlet), New York|Oyster Bay]], where he was awarded "student of the year" and contributed short fictional pieces to his school newspaper. These juvenilia incorporated some of the literary motifs and recurring subject matter he would use throughout his career: oddball names, sophomoric humor, illicit drug use, and paranoia.<ref>His contributions to the Oyster High ''Purple & Gold'' were first reprinted on pp. 156–67 of Clifford Mead's ''Thomas Pynchon: A Bibliography of Primary and Secondary Materials'' (Dalkey Archive Press, 1989).</ref><ref name=pynchonhamster>{{cite web|last1=Pynchon |first1=Thomas |title=Voice of the Hamster |url=http://themodernword.com/pynchon/pynchon_hamster.html |website=The Modern Word |access-date=September 26, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315194714/http://themodernword.com/pynchon/pynchon_hamster.html |archive-date=March 15, 2013 }}</ref><ref name=pynchonboys>{{cite web|last1=Pynchon |first1=Thomas |title=The Boys |url=http://themodernword.com/pynchon/pynchon_boys.html |website=The Modern Word |access-date=September 26, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315194955/http://themodernword.com/pynchon/pynchon_boys.html |archive-date=March 15, 2013 }}</ref><ref name=pynchonknight>{{cite web|last1=Pynchon |first1=Thomas |title=Ye Legend of Sir Stupid and the Purple Knight |url=http://themodernword.com/pynchon/pynchon_knight.html |website=The Modern Word |access-date=September 26, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130119074615/http://themodernword.com/pynchon/pynchon_knight.html |archive-date=January 19, 2013 }}</ref>

Pynchon graduated from high school in 1953 at the age of 16. That fall, he went to [[Cornell University]] to study [[engineering physics]]. At the end of his sophomore year, he enlisted to serve in the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]]. He attended [[Recruit training|boot camp]] at [[United States Naval Training Center Bainbridge]], Maryland, then received training to be an [[electrician]] at a base in [[Norfolk, Virginia]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Cowart |first=David |year=2011 |title=Thomas Pynchon and the Dark Passages of History |publisher=[[University of Georgia Press]] |location=[[Athens, Georgia]] |isbn=978-0-8203-3709-8 |page=3}}</ref> In 1956, he was aboard the [[destroyer]] [[USS Hank|USS ''Hank'']] in the Mediterranean during the [[Suez Crisis]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Krafft|first=John M.|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1lshMpwOA4wC&pg=PR10|title=The Cambridge Companion to Thomas Pynchon|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-76974-7|editor-last=Dalsgaard|editor-first=Inger H.|pages=x|language=en|chapter=Chronology of Pynchon's Life and Works|editor-last2=Herman|editor-first2=Luc|editor-last3=McHale|editor-first3=Brian}}</ref> According to recollections from his Navy friends, Pynchon said at the time that he did not intend to complete his college education.<ref name="vulture.com" />

In 1957, he returned to Cornell to pursue a degree in English. His first published story, "The Small Rain", appeared in the ''Cornell Writer'' in March 1959, and narrates an actual experience of a friend who had served in the [[United States Army|Army]]; subsequently, however, episodes and characters throughout Pynchon's fiction draw freely upon his own experiences in the Navy.<ref name=pynchon1984>{{cite book|last1=Pynchon|first1=Thomas|title=Slow Learner|date=1984|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|isbn=978-0-316-72442-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/slowlearnerearly00pync/page/8 8–32]|url=https://archive.org/details/slowlearnerearly00pync/page/8}}</ref> His short story, "Mortality and Mercy in Vienna", was published in the Spring 1959 issue of ''[[Epoch (American magazine)|Epoch]]''.<ref>[[Brian McHale|McHale, Brian]] (1981), ''Thomas Pychon: A Portrait of the Artist as a Missing Person'', in ''[[Cencrastus]]'' No. 5, Summer 1981, pp. 2 - 7, {{issn|0264-0856}}</ref>

While at Cornell, Pynchon started his friendships with [[Richard Fariña]], [[Kirkpatrick Sale]] and [[David Shetzline]]; Pynchon would go on to dedicate ''Gravity's Rainbow'' to Fariña, as well as serve as his best man and as his pallbearer. Together the two briefly led what Pynchon has called a "micro-cult" around [[Oakley Hall]]'s 1958 novel ''[[Warlock (1958 novel)|Warlock]]''. Pynchon later reminisced about his college days in the introduction he wrote in 1983 for Fariña's novel ''[[Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me]]'', first published in 1966. He reportedly attended lectures given by [[Vladimir Nabokov]], who then taught literature at Cornell. Although Nabokov later said that he had no memory of Pynchon, Nabokov's wife Véra, who graded her husband's class papers, commented that she remembered his distinctive handwriting as a mixture of printed and [[cursive]] letters, "half printing, half script."<ref name=sweeney2008>{{cite journal|last1=Sweeney |first1=Susan Elizabeth |title=The V-Shaped Paradigm: Nabokov and Pynchon |journal=Cycnos |date=June 25, 2008 |volume=12 |url=http://revel.unice.fr/cycnos/document.html?id=1475 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719002805/http://revel.unice.fr/cycnos/document.html?id=1475 |archive-date=July 19, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/thomas-pynchon-on-911-american-literature-s-greatest-conspiracy-theorist-finally-addresses-his-8830225.html|title=Thomas Pynchon on 9/11: American literature's greatest conspiracy|date=September 20, 2013|website=The Independent|access-date=February 12, 2020}}</ref> In 1958, Pynchon and Sale wrote part or all of a science-fiction musical, ''Minstrel Island'', which portrayed a dystopian future in which [[IBM]] rules the world.<ref name=gibbs2004>{{cite journal|last1=Gibbs |first1=Rodney |title=A Portrait of the Luddite as a Young Man |journal=Denver Quarterly |date=2004 |volume=39 |issue=1 |url=http://www.themodernword.com/pynchon/paper_gibbs.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061112151827/http://themodernword.com/pynchon/paper_gibbs.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 12, 2006 }}</ref> Pynchon received his [[B.A.]] with distinction as a member of [[Phi Beta Kappa]] in June 1959.

[[File:V. (1963 1st ed cover).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|alt=Book cover illustration of the letter "V." on an abstract horizon|''[[V.]]'' (1963)]]
After leaving Cornell, Pynchon began to work on his first novel: ''V''. From February 1960 to September 1962, he was employed as a technical writer at [[Boeing]] in [[Seattle]], where he compiled safety articles for the ''Bomarc Service News'', a support newsletter for the [[Bomarc Missile Program|BOMARC surface-to-air missile]] deployed by the [[U.S. Air Force]].<ref name=wisnicki2000>{{cite journal|last1=Wisnicki|first1=Adrian|title=A Trove of New Works by Thomas Pynchon? Bomarc Service News Rediscovered|journal=Pynchon Notes|date=2000|volume=No. 46-49|issue=Spring 2000}}</ref> Pynchon's experiences at Boeing inspired his depictions of the "[[Yoyodyne]]" corporation in ''[[V.]]'' and ''[[The Crying of Lot 49]]'', and both his background in physics and the technical journalism he undertook at Boeing provided much raw material for ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]''. When published in 1963, ''V.'' won a [[William Faulkner Foundation Award]] for the best first novel of the year. (It was a finalist for the National Book Award.)<ref name=nba1964>[https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-1964 "National Book Awards&nbsp;– 1964"]. National Book Foundation. Retrieved March 29, 2012.</ref>

After resigning from Boeing, Pynchon spent some time in New York and Mexico before moving to California, where he was reportedly based for much of the 1960s and early 1970s, most notably in an apartment in [[Manhattan Beach, California|Manhattan Beach]],<ref name=frost>{{cite web|last1=Frost|first1=Garrison|title=Thomas Pynchon and the South Bay|url=http://www.theaesthetic.com/NewFiles/pynchon.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030306201820/http://www.theaesthetic.com/NewFiles/pynchon.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 6, 2003|website=The Aesthetic|access-date=September 26, 2014}}</ref> as he was composing what would become the highly regarded ''Gravity's Rainbow''. Pynchon during this time flirted with the lifestyle and some of the habits of the [[Beat Generation|Beat]] and [[hippie]] [[counterculture]]s.<ref name=gordon1994>{{cite web|last1=Gordon|first1=Andrew|title=Smoking Dope with Thomas Pynchon: A Sixties Memoir|url=http://users.clas.ufl.edu/agordon/pynchon.htm|access-date=September 26, 2014}}</ref>

A negative aspect that Pynchon retrospectively found in the [[hippie movement|hippie cultural and literary movement]], both in the form of the Beats of the 1950s and the resurgence form of the 1960s, was that it "placed too much emphasis on youth, including the eternal variety."<ref name=pynchon1984 />

In 1964, his application to study mathematics as a graduate student at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] was turned down.<ref name=royster2005>{{cite journal|last1=Royster|first1=Paul|title=Thomas Pynchon: A Brief Chronology|date=June 23, 2005}}</ref> In 1966, Pynchon wrote a first-hand report on the aftermath and legacy of the [[Watts Riots]] in Los Angeles. Titled "A Journey Into the Mind of Watts", the article was published in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]''.<ref name=pynchon1966>{{cite news|last1=Pynchon|first1=Thomas|title=A Journey into the Mind of Watts|url=http://www.themodernword.com/pynchon/pynchon_essays_watts.html|work=The New York Times Magazine|date=June 12, 1966|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219074830/http://www.themodernword.com/pynchon/pynchon_essays_watts.html|archive-date=February 19, 2006}}</ref>

From the mid-1960s Pynchon has also regularly provided [[blurbs]] and introductions for a wide range of novels and non-fiction works. One of the first of these pieces was a brief review of [[Oakley Hall]]'s ''[[Warlock (Hall novel)|Warlock]]'' which appeared, along with comments by seven other writers on "neglected books", as part of a feature titled "A Gift of Books" in the December 1965 issue of ''Holiday''.

In 1968, Pynchon was one of 447 signatories to the "[[Writers and Editors War Tax Protest]]". Full-page advertisements in the ''[[New York Post]]'' and ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' listed the names of those who had pledged not to pay "the proposed 10% income tax surcharge or any war-designated tax increase", and stated their belief "that American involvement in Vietnam is morally wrong".<ref name=wartax>{{cite web|title=Writers and Editors War Tax Protest Names|url=http://www.nwtrcc.org/history/writers-and-editors-names.php|website=National War Tax Resistance Coordinating Committee|access-date=September 26, 2014}}</ref>

In an April 1964 letter to his agent, Candida Donadio, Pynchon wrote that he was facing a creative crisis, with four novels in progress, announcing: "If they come out on paper anything like they are inside my head then it will be the literary event of the millennium."<ref name=gussow1998 />

In the mid-1960s, Pynchon lived at 217 33rd St. in [[Manhattan Beach, California]], in a small downstairs apartment.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-04-20/news/cb-56727_1_south-bay/2 |title=A Tour De Force: From LAX Tower to 'Pulp Fiction' Diner to Stars' Hangouts, Pop Culture Landmarks Dot Landscape Here&nbsp;– Page 2 |last=Johnson |first=Ted |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=April 20, 1995 |access-date=August 21, 2013}}</ref>

In December 1965, Pynchon politely turned down an invitation from [[Stanley Edgar Hyman]] to teach literature at [[Bennington College]], writing that he had resolved, two or three years earlier, to write three novels at once. Pynchon described the decision as "a moment of temporary insanity", but noted that he was "too stubborn to let any of them go, let alone all of them."<ref name=mclemee2006>{{cite web|last1=McLemee|first1=Scott|title=You Hide, They Seek|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/views/mclemee/mclemee158|website=Inside Higher Ed|access-date=September 26, 2014}}</ref>

Pynchon's second novel, ''The Crying of Lot 49'', was published a few months later in 1966. Whether it was one of the three or four novels Pynchon had in progress is not known, but in a 1965 letter to Donadio, Pynchon had written that he was in the middle of writing a "[[potboiler]]". When the book grew to 155 pages, he called it, "a short story, but with gland trouble", and hoped that Donadio could "unload it on some poor sucker."<ref name=gussow1998 />

''The Crying of Lot 49'' won the Richard and Hilda Rosenthal Foundation Award shortly after publication. Although more concise and linear in its structure than Pynchon's other novels, its labyrinthine plot features an ancient, underground mail service known as "The Tristero" or "Trystero", a parody of a [[Revenge play|Jacobean revenge drama]] called ''The Courier's Tragedy'', and a corporate conspiracy involving the bones of [[World War II]] American [[GI (term)|GIs]] being used as charcoal [[cigarette filter]]s. It proposes a series of seemingly incredible interconnections between these events and other similarly bizarre revelations that confront the novel's protagonist, Oedipa Maas. Like ''V.,'' the novel contains a wealth of references to science and technology and to obscure historical events, with both books dwelling on the detritus of American society and culture. ''The Crying of Lot 49'' also continues Pynchon's strategy of composing parodic song lyrics and punning names, and referencing aspects of [[popular culture]] within his prose narratives. In particular, it incorporates a very direct [[The Crying of Lot 49#Vladimir Nabokov|allusion]] to the protagonist of Nabokov's ''[[Lolita]]'' within the lyric of a love lament sung by a member of "The Paranoids", an American teenage band who deliberately sing their songs with British accents (p.&nbsp;17).

Pynchon's most celebrated novel is his third, ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]'', published in 1973.

The major portion of ''Gravity's Rainbow'' takes place in London and Europe in the final months of [[World War II]] and the weeks immediately following [[Victory in Europe Day|VE Day]], and is narrated for the most part from within the historical moment in which it is set. In this way, Pynchon's text enacts a type of [[irony|dramatic irony]] whereby neither the characters nor the various [[narrator|narrative voices]] are aware of specific historical circumstances, such as the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] and, except as hints, premonitions and mythography, the complicity between Western corporate interests and the Nazi war machine, which figure prominently in readers' apprehensions of the novel's historical context. For example, at war's end the narrator observes:  "There are rumors of a War Crimes Tribunal under way in Nürnberg. No one Slothrop has listened to is clear who's trying whom for what ... " (p.&nbsp;681) Such an approach generates dynamic tension and moments of acute self-consciousness, as both reader and author seem drawn ever deeper into the "[[Plot (narrative)|plot]]", in various senses of that term:

{{Quote box|align=left|width=200px|quote=If they can get you asking the wrong questions, they don't have to worry about answers.|source=–''Gravity's Rainbow''|salign=right}}

The novel invokes anti-authority sentiments, often through violations of narrative conventions and integrity. For example, as the protagonist, Tyrone Slothrop, considers the fact that his own family "made its money killing trees", he apostrophizes his apology and plea for advice to the [[Coppicing|coppice]] within which he has momentarily taken refuge. In an overt incitement to [[Eco-anarchism|eco-activism]], Pynchon's narrative agency then has it that "a medium-sized pine nearby nods its top and suggests, 'Next time you come across a logging operation out here, find one of their tractors that isn't being guarded, and take its oil filter with you. That's what you can do.'" (p.&nbsp;553)

Encyclopedic in scope and often self-conscious in style, the novel displays erudition in its treatment of an array of material drawn from the fields of [[psychology]], chemistry, mathematics, history, religion, music, literature, human sexuality, and film. Pynchon wrote the first draft of ''Gravity's Rainbow'' in "neat, tiny script on engineer's [[Graph paper#Formats|quadrille paper]]".<ref name=weisenburgerbook /> Pynchon worked on the novel throughout the 1960s and early 1970s while he was living in California and Mexico City.

''Gravity's Rainbow'' shared the 1974 [[National Book Award]] with ''A Crown of Feathers and Other Stories'' by [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]] (split award).<ref name=nba1974/> That same year, the [[Pulitzer Prize]] fiction panel unanimously recommended ''Gravity's Rainbow'' for the award, but the Pulitzer board vetoed the jury's recommendation, describing the novel as "unreadable", "turgid", "overwritten", and in parts "obscene".<ref name=kihss1974>{{cite news|last1=Kihss|first1=Peter|title=Pulitzer Jurors Dismayed on Pynchon|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 8, 1974|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/08/archives/pulitzer-jurors-his-third-novel.html|access-date = September 19, 2017}}</ref> (No [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]] was awarded and finalists were not recognized before 1980.)<ref name=pulitzer>[http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat/Fiction "Fiction"].

===Later career===
[[File:Slow Learner (1984 1st ed cover).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|alt=Book cover illustration of a massive white fountain pen seated on a bicycle|''[[Slow Learner]]'' (1984)]]
A collection of Pynchon's early short stories, ''[[Slow Learner]]'', was published in 1984, with a lengthy [[autobiography|autobiographical]] introduction. In October of the same year, an article titled "Is It O.K. to Be a Luddite?" was published in the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/05/18/reviews/pynchon-luddite.html |date=October 28, 1984 |title=Is It O.K.

====''Vineland''====
{{Main|Vineland}}
Pynchon's fourth novel, ''[[Vineland]]'', was published in 1990, but disappointed some fans and critics. It did, however, receive a positive review from the novelist [[Salman Rushdie]]. The novel is set in California in the 1980s and 1960s and describes the relationship between an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[COINTELPRO]] agent and a female radical filmmaker. Its strong socio-political undercurrents detail the constant battle between [[authoritarianism]] and [[communalism]], and the nexus between [[resistance movement|resistance]] and complicity, but with a typically Pynchonian sense of humor.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rushdie |first1=Salman |title=Still Crazy After All These Years |url=http://themodernword.com/pynchon/review_nyt_vineland.html |access-date=September 26, 2014 |work=The New York Times |date=January 14, 1990 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015150615/http://www.themodernword.com/pynchon/review_nyt_vineland.html |archive-date=October 15, 2014 }}</ref><ref name=berressembook>{{cite book|last1=Berressem|first1=Hanjo|title=Pynchon's Poetics: Interfacing Theory and Text|date=1992|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana and Chicago|isbn=978-0-252-01919-7|pages=236–7}}</ref>

Pynchon's fifth novel, ''[[Mason & Dixon]]'', was published in 1997, though it had been a work in progress since at least January 1975.<ref name=gussow1998 /><ref name=ulin1997>{{cite news|last1=Ulin|first1=David|title=Gravity's End|work=Salon|date=April 25, 1997}}</ref>

The meticulously researched novel is a sprawling [[postmodern literature|postmodernist]] saga recounting the lives and careers of the English astronomer [[Charles Mason]] and his partner, the surveyor [[Jeremiah Dixon]], the surveyors of the [[Mason–Dixon line]], during the birth of the [[American Revolution|American Republic]]. Some commentators acknowledged it as a welcome return to form. The American critic [[Harold Bloom]] hailed the novel as Pynchon's "masterpiece to date".<ref name=bloom2003>{{cite book|last1=Bloom|first1=Harold|title=Thomas Pynchon|date=2003|publisher=Chelsea House|isbn=978-0-7910-7030-7}}</ref>

The novel is a [[Frame story|frame narrative]] told from the focal point of one Rev. Wicks Cherrycoke – a clergyman of dubious orthodoxy – who, on a cold December evening in 1786, attempts to entertain and divert his extended family (partly for amusement, and partly to keep his coveted status as a guest in the house). Claiming to have accompanied Mason and Dixon throughout their journeys, Cherrycoke tells a tale intermingling Mason and Dixon's biographies with history, fantasy, legend, speculation, and outright fabrication.

====''Against the Day''====
{{Main|Against the Day}}
A variety of rumors pertaining to the subject matter of ''[[Against the Day]]'' circulated for a number of years. Most specific of these were comments made by the former German minister of culture [[Michael Naumann]], who stated that he assisted Pynchon in his research about "a Russian mathematician [who] studied for [[David Hilbert]] in [[Göttingen]]", and that the new novel would trace the life and loves of [[Sofia Kovalevskaya]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Makowsky |first1=Johann A. |title=Modernism, Fiction and Mathematics |journal=Notices of the American Mathematical Society |date=2020 |volume=67 |issue=10 |page=1593 |quote=the latter contains a lot of mathematical material pertaining to Sofia Kovalevskaya and to Hilbert’s school in Göttingen. Pynchon seemingly researched this material with the help of Michael Naumann,}}</ref>

In July 2006, a new, untitled novel by Pynchon was announced along with a synopsis written by Pynchon himself, which appeared on [[Amazon.com]]; it stated that the novel's action takes place between the [[World's Columbian Exposition|1893 Chicago World's Fair]] and the time immediately following [[World War I]]. "With a worldwide disaster looming just a few years ahead", Pynchon wrote in his [[blurb|book description]], "it is a time of unrestrained corporate greed, false religiosity, moronic fecklessness, and evil intent in high places. No reference to the present day is intended or should be inferred." He promised cameos by [[Nikola Tesla]], [[Bela Lugosi]] and [[Groucho Marx]], as well as "stupid songs" and "strange sexual practices". Subsequently, the title of the new book was reported to be ''Against the Day'' and a Penguin spokesperson confirmed that the synopsis was Pynchon's.<ref name=patterson2006>{{cite web|last1=Patterson|first1=Troy|title=The Pynchon Post|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2006/07/the_pynchon_post.html|website=Slate|date=July 19, 2006|access-date=September 26, 2014}}</ref><ref name=italie2006>{{cite news|last1=Italie|first1=Hillel|title=New Thomas Pynchon Novel is on the way|agency=Associated Press|date=July 20, 2006}}</ref>

''Against the Day'' was released on November 21, 2006, and is 1,085 pages long in the first edition hardcover. The book was given almost no promotion by Penguin and professional book reviewers were given little time in advance to review the book. An edited version of Pynchon's synopsis was used as the jacket-flap copy and Kovalevskaya does appear, although as only one of over a hundred characters.

Composed in part of a series of interwoven pastiches of popular fiction genres from the era in which it is set, the novel inspired mixed reactions from critics and reviewers. One reviewer remarked, "It is brilliant, but it is exhaustingly brilliant."<ref name=leith2006>{{cite news|last1=Leith|first1=Sam|title=Pinning down Pynchon|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/dec/02/thomaspynchon|access-date=September 26, 2014|work=The Guardian|date=December 1, 2006}}</ref> Other reviewers described ''Against the Day'' as "lengthy and rambling"<ref name=wood2007>{{cite news|last1=Wood|first1=Michael|title=Humming along|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v29/n01/michael-wood/humming-along|access-date=September 26, 2014|work=London Review of Books|issue=1|date=January 4, 2007|volume=29}}</ref> and "a baggy monster of a book",<ref name=sante2007>{{cite news|last1=Sante|first1=Luc|title=Inside the Time Machine|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2007/jan/11/inside-the-time-machine/?pagination=false|access-date=September 26, 2014|work=The New York Review of Books|date=January 11, 2007}}</ref> while negative appraisals condemned the novel for its "silliness"<ref name=kirsch2006>{{cite news|last1=Kirsch|first1=Adam|title=Pynchon: He Who Lives By the List, Dies by It|url=http://www.nysun.com/arts/pynchon-he-who-lives-by-the-list-dies-by-it/43545/|access-date=September 26, 2014|work=The New York Sun|date=November 15, 2006}}</ref> or characterized its action as "fairly pointless" and remained unimpressed by its "grab bag of themes".<ref name=miller2006>{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Laura|title=The fall of the house of Pynchon|url=http://www.salon.com/2006/11/21/pynchon_3/|website=Salon.com|date=November 21, 2006|access-date=September 26, 2014}}</ref>

====''Inherent Vice''====
{{Main|Inherent Vice|Inherent Vice (film)}}
''[[Inherent Vice]]'' was published in August 2009.

A synopsis and brief extract from the novel, along with the novel's title, ''Inherent Vice'', and dust jacket image, were printed in Penguin Press' Summer 2009 catalogue. The book was advertised by the publisher as "part-[[hardboiled|noir]], part-[[psychedelia|psychedelic]] romp, all Thomas Pynchon—[[private investigator|private eye]] Doc Sportello comes, occasionally, out of a [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] haze to watch the end of an era as [[free love]] slips away and [[paranoia]] creeps in with the L.A. fog."

A promotional video for the novel was released by Penguin Books on August 4, 2009, with the character voiceover narrated by the author himself.<ref name=kurutz2009>{{cite news|last1=Kurutz|first1=Steven|title=Yup, It's Him: A Pynchon Mystery Solved|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2009/08/11/pynchon-revealed/|access-date=September 26, 2014|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=August 11, 2009}}</ref>

====''Bleeding Edge''====
{{main|Bleeding Edge (novel)}}
''Bleeding Edge'' takes place in Manhattan's [[Silicon Alley]] during "the lull between the collapse of the dot-com boom and the terrible events of [[September 11 attacks|September 11]]."  The novel was published on September 17, 2013<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/02/25/pynchon-takes-on-silicon-alley/|title=Pynchon Takes On Silicon Alley|last=Alden|first=William|date=February 25, 2013|website=DealBook|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=August 21, 2013}}</ref> to positive reviews.

==Style==
Poet [[L. E. Sissman]] wrote from ''[[The New Yorker]]'': "He is almost a mathematician of prose, who calculates the least and the greatest stress each word and line, each pun and ambiguity, can bear, and applies his knowledge accordingly and virtually without lapses, though he takes many scary, bracing linguistic risks. Thus his remarkably supple diction can first treat of a painful and delicate love scene and then roar, without pause, into the sounds and echoes of a drugged and drunken orgy."<ref name=sissman1973>{{cite news|last1=Sissman|first1=L.E.|title=Hieronymus and Robert Bosch: The Art of Thomas Pynchon|work=The New Yorker|date=May 19, 1973}}</ref> Pynchon's style is commonly classified as [[postmodernism|postmodernist]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://postmodernblog.tumblr.com/ |title=Postmodernism |publisher=postmodernblog.tumblr.com |access-date=August 21, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://universitypublishingonline.org/cambridge/companions/chapter.jsf?bid=CBO9781139019866&cid=CBO9781139019866A016 |title=Pynchon's postmodernism |publisher=University Publishing Online |access-date=August 21, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|jstor=20872015|title='Gravity's Rainbow' and the postmodern picaro|last=Rosenthal|first=Regine|journal=Revue française d'études américaines|issue=42|date=November 1989|volume=42|pages=407–426|doi=10.3406/rfea.1989.1376}}</ref>

==Themes==
Along with its emphasis on sociopolitical themes such as [[racism]] and [[imperialism]], its awareness and appropriation of many elements of traditional [[high culture]] and [[literature|literary]] form, Pynchon's work explores philosophical, theological, and sociological ideas exhaustively, though in quirky and approachable ways. His writings demonstrate a strong affinity with the practitioners and artifacts of [[low culture]], including [[comic book]]s and [[animated cartoon|cartoons]], [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]], popular films, [[television|television programs]], [[cookery]], [[urban myth]]s, paranoia and [[conspiracy theories]], and [[folk art]]. This blurring of the conventional boundary between "high" and "low" culture has been seen as one of the defining characteristics of his writing.<ref name="Moore 1987">{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Thomas|title=The Style of Connectedness: Gravity's Rainbow and Thomas Pynchon|date=1987|publisher=University of Missouri Press|isbn=978-0826206251}}</ref><ref name="Cowart 1990">{{cite journal|last=Cowart|first=David|title=Attenuated Postmodernism: Pynchon's Vineland|journal=Critique: Studies in Contemporary Fiction|date=1990|volume=32|number=2|pages=67–76|doi=10.1080/00111619.1990.9933800|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00111619.1990.9933800}}</ref>

In particular, Pynchon has revealed himself in his fiction and non-fiction as an aficionado of [[popular music]]. Song lyrics and mock [[musical theater|musical]] numbers appear in each of his novels, and, in his autobiographical introduction to the ''Slow Learner'' collection of early stories, he reveals a fondness for both [[jazz]] and [[rock and roll]]. The character McClintic Sphere in ''V.'' is a fictional composite of jazz musicians such as [[Ornette Coleman]], [[Charlie Parker]] and [[Thelonious Monk]]. In ''The Crying of Lot 49'', the lead singer of The Paranoids sports "a [[The Beatles|Beatle]] haircut" and sings with an English accent. In the closing pages of ''Gravity's Rainbow'', there is an apocryphal report that Tyrone Slothrop, the novel's protagonist, played [[kazoo]] and [[harmonica]] as a guest musician on a record released by [[The Fool (design collective)|The Fool]] in the 1960s (having [[Magic realism|magically]] recovered the latter instrument, his "[[Blues harp|harp]]", in a German stream in 1945, after losing it down the toilet in 1939 at the Roseland Ballroom in [[Roxbury, Massachusetts|Roxbury]], [[Boston]], to the strains of the jazz standard "[[Cherokee (Ray Noble song)|Cherokee]]", upon which tune Charlie Parker was simultaneously inventing [[bebop]] in New York, as Pynchon describes). In ''Vineland'', both Zoyd Wheeler and Isaiah Two Four are also musicians: Zoyd played keyboards in a '60s [[surf music|surf]] band called The Corvairs, while Isaiah played in a [[punk rock|punk]] band called Billy Barf and the Vomitones. In ''Mason & Dixon'', one of the characters plays on the "Clavier" the varsity drinking song that will later become "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]"; while in another episode a character remarks tangentially [[Stand by your man|"Sometimes, it's hard to be a woman"]].

In his introduction to ''[[Slow Learner]]'', Pynchon acknowledges a debt to the anarchic bandleader [[Spike Jones]], and in 1994, he penned a 3000-word set of [[liner notes]] for the album ''Spiked!'', a collection of Jones's recordings released on the short-lived BMG Catalyst label.<ref>[http://www.45worlds.com/cdalbum/cd/09026619822 ''CD Album – Spike Jones – Spiked!''] at [[45Worlds]]</ref> Pynchon also wrote the liner notes for ''[[Nobody's Cool]]'', the second album of [[indie rock]] band [[Lotion (band)|Lotion]], in which he states that "rock and roll remains one of the last honorable callings, and a working band is a miracle of everyday life. Which is basically what these guys do". He is also known to be a fan of [[Roky Erickson]].<ref name="Meet Your Neighbor, Thomas Pynchon">{{Cite magazine |last=Sales |first=Nancy |date=November 11, 1996 |title=Meet Your Neighbor, Thomas Pynchon |url=http://nymag.com/arts/books/features/48268/index3.html |magazine=New York |access-date=May 31, 2017}}</ref>

Investigations and digressions into the realms of [[human sexuality]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[mathematics]], [[science]], and [[technology]] recur throughout Pynchon's works. One of his earliest short stories, "Low-lands" (1960), features a meditation on [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg's]] [[uncertainty principle]] as a metaphor for telling stories about one's own experiences. His next published work, "Entropy" (1960), introduced [[entropy|the concept]] which was to become synonymous with Pynchon's name (though Pynchon later admitted the "shallowness of [his] understanding" of the subject, and noted that choosing an abstract concept first and trying to construct a narrative around it was "a lousy way to go about writing a story"). Another early story, "Under the Rose" (1961), includes among its cast of characters a [[cyborg]] set anachronistically in [[Victorian-era]] [[Egypt]] (a type of writing now called [[steampunk]]). This story, significantly reworked by Pynchon, appears as Chapter 3 of ''V.'' "The Secret Integration" (1964), Pynchon's last published short story, is a sensitively handled [[coming-of-age]] tale in which a group of young boys face the consequences of the American policy of [[racial integration]]. At one point in the story, the boys attempt to understand the new policy by way of the [[antiderivative|mathematical operation]], the only sense of the word with which they are familiar.

''The Crying of Lot 49'' also alludes to entropy and [[communication theory]], and contains scenes and descriptions which parody or appropriate [[calculus]], [[Zeno's paradoxes]], and the [[thought experiment]] known as [[Maxwell's demon]]. At the same time, the novel also investigates [[homosexuality]], [[celibacy]] and both medically sanctioned and illicit [[psychedelic drug]] use. ''Gravity's Rainbow'' describes many varieties of [[sexual fetishism]] (including [[sado-masochism]], [[coprophilia]] and a borderline case of [[tentacle erotica]]), and features numerous episodes of drug use, most notably [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] but also [[cocaine]], naturally occurring [[hallucinogen]]s, and the mushroom ''[[Amanita muscaria]].'' ''Gravity's Rainbow'' also derives much from Pynchon's background in mathematics: at one point, the geometry of garter belts is compared with that of [[cathedral]] spires, both described as [[mathematical singularity|mathematical singularities]]. ''Mason & Dixon'' explores the scientific, theological, and socio-cultural foundations of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Age of Reason]] while also depicting the relationships between actual historical figures and fictional characters in intricate detail and, like ''Gravity's Rainbow'', is an archetypal example of the genre of [[historiographic metafiction]].

Pynchon's work also has similarities with writers in the [[modernist]] tradition who wrote long novels dealing with large [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] or [[political]] issues, such as ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' by [[James Joyce]], ''[[A Passage to India]]'' by [[E. M. Forster]], ''[[The Apes of God]]'' by [[Wyndham Lewis]], ''[[The Man Without Qualities]]'' by [[Robert Musil]] and the [[U.S.A.

He also outlines the specific influence on his own early fiction of literary works by [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Henry Miller]], [[Saul Bellow]], [[Herbert Gold]], [[Philip Roth]], [[Norman Mailer]], [[John Buchan]] and [[Graham Greene]], and non-fiction works by [[Helen Waddell]], [[Norbert Wiener]] and [[Isaac Asimov]].<ref name=pynchon1984 />

===Legacy===
Pynchon's work has been cited as an influence and inspiration by many writers, including [[David Foster Wallace]], [[William Vollmann]], [[Richard Powers]], [[Steve Erickson]], [[David Mitchell (author)|David Mitchell]], [[Neal Stephenson]], [[Dave Eggers]], [[William Gibson]], [[Salman Rushdie]], [[Alan Moore]], and [[Tommaso Pincio]] (whose pseudonym is an Italian rendering of Pynchon's name).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/a-literary-recluse-the-mystery-of-pynchon-412214.html|title=A literary recluse: The mystery of Pynchon|date=August 17, 2006|work=The Independent|access-date=January 24, 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2013/11/08/lush-life-william-t-vollmann-243896.html|title=The Lush Life of William T.

Thanks to his influence on Gibson and Stephenson in particular, Pynchon became one of the progenitors of [[cyberpunk]] fiction; a 1987 essay in ''[[Spin magazine|Spin]]'' magazine by [[Timothy Leary]] explicitly named ''Gravity's Rainbow'' as the "Old Testament" of cyberpunk, with Gibson's ''[[Neuromancer]]'' and its sequels as the "New Testament". Though the term "cyberpunk" did not become prevalent until the early 1980s, since Leary's article many readers have retroactively included ''Gravity's Rainbow'' in the genre, along with other works—''e.g.,'' [[Samuel R. Delany]]'s ''[[Dhalgren]]'' and many works of [[Philip K. Dick]]—which seem, after the fact, to anticipate cyberpunk styles and themes. The [[encyclopedia|encyclopedic]] nature of Pynchon's novels also led to some attempts to link his work with the short-lived [[hypertext fiction]] movement of the 1990s.<ref name=page2002>{{cite book|last1=Page|first1=Adrian|editor1-last=Bissell|editor1-first=Elizabeth B|title=The Question of Literature: The Place on the Literary in Contemporary Theory'|date=2002|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-5744-1|chapter=Towards a poetics of hypertext fiction}}</ref>

==Media scrutiny of private life==
Relatively little is known about Pynchon's private life; he has carefully avoided contact with reporters for more than forty years. Only a few photos of him are known to exist, nearly all from his high school and college days, and his whereabouts have often remained undisclosed.

A 1963 review of ''V.'' in the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'' described Pynchon as "a recluse" living in Mexico, thereby introducing the [[mass media|media]] label with which journalists have characterized him throughout his career.<ref name=plimpton1963>{{cite news|last1=Plimpton|first1=George|title=Mata Hari with a Clockwork Eye, Alligators in the Sewer|url=http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/books/Pynchon_V.pdf|access-date=September 26, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=April 21, 1963}}</ref> Nonetheless, Pynchon's personal absence from [[mass media]] is one of the notable features of his life, and it has generated many rumors and apocryphal anecdotes.

Pynchon wrote an introduction for his short story collection ''[[Slow Learner]]''. His comments on the stories after reading them again for the first time in many years, and his recollection of the events surrounding their creation, amount to the author's only autobiographical comments to his readers.

===1970s and 1980s===
After the publication and success of ''Gravity's Rainbow'', interest mounted in finding out more about the identity of the author. At the 1974 National Book Awards ceremony, the president of [[Viking Press]], [[Thomas Guinzburg|Tom Guinzberg]], arranged for double-talking comedian [[Irwin Corey|"Professor" Irwin Corey]] to accept the prize on Pynchon's behalf.<ref name=royster2005 /> Many of the assembled guests had no idea who Corey was and had never seen the author, so they assumed it was Pynchon himself on the stage delivering Corey's trademark torrent of rambling, pseudo-scholarly verbiage.<ref name=corey1974>{{cite web|last1=Corey|first1=Irwin|title=Transcript of Remarks Given at the National Book Awards, Thursday, April 18, 1974|url=http://www.irwincorey.org/routines.html|access-date=October 17, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224035906/http://irwincorey.org/routines.html|archive-date=December 24, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Toward the end of Corey's address a streaker ran through the hall, adding further to the confusion.

An article published in the ''[[SoHo Weekly News]]'' claimed that Pynchon was in fact [[J. D. Salinger]].<ref name=batchelor1976>{{cite news|last1=Batchelor|first1=J. C.|title=Thomas Pynchon is not Thomas Pynchon, or, This is End of the Plot Which Has No Name|work=[[SoHo Weekly News]]|date=April 22, 1976}}</ref> Pynchon's written response to this theory was simple: "Not bad. Keep trying."<ref name=tannerbook>{{cite book|last1=Tanner|first1=Tony|title=Thomas Pynchon|date=1982|isbn=978-0-416-31670-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/thomaspynchon00tann/page/18 18]|url=https://archive.org/details/thomaspynchon00tann/page/18}}</ref>

Thereafter, the first piece to provide substantial information about Pynchon's personal life was a biographical account written by a former Cornell University friend, [[Jules Siegel]], and published in ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine. In his article, Siegel reveals that Pynchon had a [[complex (psychology)|complex]] about his teeth and underwent extensive and painful reconstructive surgery, was nicknamed "Tom" at Cornell and attended [[mass (liturgy)|Mass]] diligently, acted as [[best man]] at Siegel's wedding, and that he later also had an affair with Siegel's wife. Siegel recalls Pynchon saying he did attend some of [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s lectures at Cornell but that he could hardly make out what Nabokov was saying because of his thick Russian accent. Siegel also records Pynchon's commenting: "Every weirdo in the world is on my wavelength", an observation borne out by the [[crank (person)|crankiness]] and [[zealot]]ry that has attached itself to his name and work in subsequent years.<ref name="siegel1977">{{cite news|last1=Siegel|first1=Jules|title=Who is Thomas Pynchon, and why did he take off with my wife?|work=Playboy|date=Mar 1977}}</ref>

===1990s===
Pynchon does not like to talk with reporters, and refuses the spectacle of [[celebrity]] and public appearances. Some readers and critics have suggested that there were and are perhaps aesthetic (and ideological) motivations behind his choice to remain aloof from public life. For example, the protagonist in [[Janette Turner Hospital]]'s short story "For Mr. Voss or Occupant" (published in 1991), explains to her daughter that she is writing

{{quote|a study of authors who become reclusive. [[Patrick White]], [[Emily Dickinson]], J. D. Salinger, Thomas Pynchon.

More recently, book critic Arthur Salm has written that

{{quote|the man simply chooses not to be a public figure, an attitude that resonates on a frequency so out of phase with that of the prevailing culture that if Pynchon and [[Paris Hilton]] were ever to meet—the circumstances, I admit, are beyond imagining—the resulting matter/[[antimatter]] explosion would vaporize everything from here to [[Tau Ceti]] IV.<ref name=salm2004>{{cite news|last1=Salm|first1=Arthur|title=A Screaming Comes Across the Sky (but Not a Photo)|work=San Diego Union-Tribune|date=8 Feb 2004}}</ref>|}}

Pynchon has published a number of articles and reviews in the mainstream American media, including words of support for Salman Rushdie and his then-wife, [[Marianne Wiggins]], after the [[fatwa]] was pronounced [[The Satanic Verses controversy|against Rushdie]] by the [[Iran]]ian leader, [[Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini]].<ref name=pynchon1989>{{cite news|last1=Pynchon|first1=Thomas|title=Words for Salman Rushdie|work=The New York Times Book Review|date=March 12, 1989}}</ref> In the following year, Rushdie's enthusiastic review of Pynchon's ''Vineland'' prompted Pynchon to send him another message hinting that if Rushdie were ever in New York, the two should arrange a meeting. Eventually, the two did have dinner together. Rushdie later commented: "He was extremely Pynchon-esque. He was the Pynchon I wanted him to be".<ref>{{cite web |last=Boog |first=Jason |url=http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/salman-rushdies-dinner-with-thomas-pynchon_b9651 |title=Salman Rushdie's Dinner with Thomas Pynchon&nbsp;– GalleyCat |publisher=Mediabistro.com |date=July 17, 2009 |access-date=August 13, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715115240/http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/salman-rushdies-dinner-with-thomas-pynchon_b9651 |archive-date=July 15, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 1990, Pynchon married his literary agent, Melanie Jackson—a great-granddaughter of [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and a granddaughter of [[Robert H. Jackson]], U.S. Supreme Court Justice and Nuremberg trials prosecutor—and fathered a son, Jackson, in 1991.<ref>{{Cite web|date=October 1, 2013|title=[Review] {{!}} First Family, Second Life, by Joshua Cohen|url=https://harpers.org/archive/2013/10/first-family-second-life/|access-date=August 13, 2020|website=Harper's Magazine|language=en}}</ref> The disclosure of Pynchon's 1990s location in New York City, after many years in which he was believed to be dividing his time between Mexico and northern California, led some journalists and photographers to try to track him down. Shortly before the publication of ''Mason & Dixon'' in 1997, a [[CNN]] camera crew filmed him in [[Manhattan]]. Angered by this invasion of his privacy, he called CNN asking that he not be identified in the footage of the street scenes near his home. When asked by CNN, Pynchon rejected their characterization of him as a recluse, remarking "My belief is that 'recluse' is a code word generated by journalists ... meaning, 'doesn't like to talk to reporters'." CNN also quoted him as saying, "Let me be unambiguous.

After several references to Pynchon's work and reputation were made on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The John Larroquette Show]]'', Pynchon (through his agent) reportedly contacted the series' producers to offer suggestions and corrections. When a local Pynchon sighting became a major plot point in a 1994 episode of the series, Pynchon was sent the script for his approval; as well as providing the title of a fictitious work to be used in one episode ("Pandemonium of the Sun"), the novelist apparently vetoed a final scene that called for an extra playing him to be filmed from behind, walking away from the shot.<ref name=cnn1997/><ref name=glenn2003>{{cite news|last1=Glenn|first1=Joshua|title=Pynchon and Homer|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2003/10/19/pynchon_and_homer/|access-date=September 26, 2014|work=The Boston Globe|date=October 19, 2003}}</ref> Pynchon also insisted that it should be specifically mentioned in the episode that Pynchon was seen wearing a T-shirt showing psychedelic-rock musician [[Roky Erickson]].<ref name=Grantland2013>{{cite web |url=https://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/purple-drank-britney-and-the-rachel-the-weird-but-logical-pop-culture-obsessions-of-thomas-pynchons-bleeding-edge/ |title=Purple Drank, Britney, and The Rachel: The Weird But Logical Pop Culture Obsessions of Thomas Pynchon's Bleeding Edge

More recently, Pynchon provided [[fax]]ed answers to questions submitted by author [[David Hajdu]] and permitted excerpts from his personal correspondence to be quoted in Hajdu's 2001 book, ''Positively 4th Street: The Lives and Times of [[Joan Baez]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Mimi Fariña|Mimi Baez Fariña]] and [[Richard Fariña]]''.<ref name=warner2001>{{cite news|last1=Warner|first1=Simon|title=A king, a queen and two knaves?: An Interview with David Hadju (sic)|url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/010802-hadju/|access-date=September 26, 2014|work=PopMatters|date=August 2, 2001}}</ref>

Pynchon's insistence on maintaining his personal [[privacy]] and on having his work speak for itself has resulted in a number of outlandish rumors and hoaxes over the years. Indeed, claims that Pynchon was the [[Theodore Kaczynski|Unabomber]] or a sympathizer with the Waco [[Branch Davidians]] after the 1993 siege were upstaged in the mid-1990s by the invention of an elaborate rumor insinuating that Pynchon and one "[[Wanda Tinasky]]" were the same person.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} A collection of the Tinasky letters was eventually published as a paperback book in 1996; however, Pynchon himself denied having written the letters, and no direct attribution of the letters to Pynchon was ever made. "Literary detective" [[Donald Foster (professor)|Donald Foster]] subsequently showed that the ''Letters'' were in fact written by an obscure [[Beat generation|Beat]] writer, [[Tom Hawkins (writer)|Tom Hawkins]], who had murdered his wife and then committed suicide in 1988. Foster's evidence was conclusive, including finding the typewriter on which the "Tinasky" letters had been written.<ref name=fosterbook>{{cite book|last1=Foster|first1=Don|title=Author Unknown: On the Trail of Anonymous|url=https://archive.org/details/authorunknown00donf|url-access=registration|date=2000}}</ref>

In 1998, over 120 letters that Pynchon had written to his longtime agent, Candida Donadio, were donated by the family of a private collector, Carter Burden, to the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York City. The letters ranged from 1963 to 1982, thus covering some of the author's most creative and prolific years. Although the Morgan Library originally intended to allow scholars to view the letters, at Pynchon's request the Burden family and Morgan Library agreed to seal these letters until after Pynchon's death.<ref name=gussow1998>{{cite news|last1=Gussow|first1=Mel|title=Pynchon's Letters Nudge His Mask|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/04/books/pynchon-s-letters-nudge-his-mask.html|access-date=September 26, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=March 4, 1998}}</ref>

His ''Simpsons'' appearances are some of the few occasions that Pynchon's voice has been broadcast in the media.]]
Responding to the image which has been manufactured in the media over the years, Pynchon made two cameo animated appearances on the television series ''[[The Simpsons]]'' in 2004. The first occurs in the episode "[[Diatribe of a Mad Housewife]]", in which [[Marge Simpson]] becomes a novelist. He plays himself, with a paper bag over his head, and provides a blurb for the back cover of Marge's book, speaking in a broad Long Island accent: "Here's your quote: Thomas Pynchon loved this book, almost as much as he loves cameras!" He then starts yelling at passing cars: "Hey, over here, have your picture taken with a reclusive author! Today only, we'll throw in a free autograph! But, wait! There's more!"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://themodernword.com/pynchon/pynchon_film_tv.html |title=Pynchon References on TV |publisher=themodernword.com |access-date=December 10, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130115328/http://themodernword.com/pynchon/pynchon_film_tv.html |archive-date=November 30, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://themodernword.com/pynchon/ketzan_simpsons.htm |title=Literary Titan Thomas Pynchon Breaks 40-Year Silence&nbsp;– on ''The Simpsons''! |first=Eric |last=Ketzan |publisher=themodernword.com |access-date=December 10, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311101734/http://www.themodernword.com/pynchon/ketzan_simpsons.htm |archive-date=March 11, 2011 }}</ref> In his second appearance, in "[[All's Fair in Oven War]]", Pynchon's dialogue consists entirely of [[pun]]s on his novel titles ("These wings are 'V'-licious! I'll put this recipe in 'The Gravity's Rainbow Cookbook', right next to 'The Frying of [[Latke]] 49'."). The cartoon representation of Pynchon reappears in a third, non-speaking cameo, as a guest at the fictional WordLoaf convention depicted in the 18th season episode "[[Moe'N'a Lisa]]". The episode first aired on November 19, 2006, the Sunday before Pynchon's sixth novel, ''Against the Day'', was released.  According to [[Al Jean]] on the 15th season DVD episode commentary, Pynchon wanted to do the series because his son was a big fan.

During pre-production of "All's Fair in Oven War", Pynchon faxed one page from the script to producer [[Matt Selman]] with several handwritten edits to his lines. Of particular emphasis was Pynchon's outright refusal to utter the line "No wonder [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] is such a fat-ass." Pynchon's objection apparently had nothing to do with the salty language as he explained in a footnote to the edit, "... Homer is my role model and I can't speak ill of him."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Krumboltz|first1=Mike|title=Thomas Pynchon Draws the Line at Making Fun of Homer Simpson's Big Butt|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/blogs/tv-news/thomas-pynchon-simpsons-175632030.html|publisher=Yahoo TV|access-date=September 5, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Selman|first1=Matt|title=Matt Selman|url=https://twitter.com/mattselman/status/505082780561051649|website=Matt Selman's Twitter Account|publisher=Twitter|access-date=September 5, 2014|quote=The fax sent to us by Thomas Pynchon with his jokes written on the script page}}</ref>

In celebration of the 100th anniversary of [[George Orwell]]'s birth, Pynchon wrote a new foreword to Orwell's celebrated [[dystopia]]n novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. The introduction presents a brief biography of Orwell as well as a reflection on some of the critical responses to ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''. Pynchon also offers his own reflection in the introduction that "what is perhaps [most] important, indeed necessary, to a working prophet, is to be able to see deeper than most of us into the human soul."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Orwell|first1=George|title=Nineteen Eighty-Four|date=2003|publisher=Plume, Harcourt & Brace|location=New York|isbn=978-0-452-28423-4|url=https://archive.org/details/nineteeneightyfo00orwe_1}}</ref>

In July 2006, [[Amazon.com]] created a page showing an upcoming 992-page, untitled, Thomas Pynchon novel. A description of the soon-to-be published novel appeared on Amazon purporting to be written by Pynchon himself. The description was taken down, prompting speculation over its authenticity, but the blurb was soon back up along with the title of Pynchon's new novel ''Against the Day''.

Shortly before ''Against the Day'' was published, Pynchon's prose appeared in the program for "''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart|The Daily Show]]'': Ten Fu@#ing Years (The Concert)", a retrospective on [[Jon Stewart]]'s comedy-news broadcast ''The Daily Show''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themodernword.com/pynchon/pynchon_essays_dailyshow.html |title=Pynchon References on TV |publisher=themodernword.com |access-date=December 10, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130114945/http://themodernword.com/pynchon/pynchon_essays_dailyshow.html |archive-date=November 30, 2010 }}</ref>

On December 6, 2006, Pynchon joined a campaign by many other major authors to clear [[Ian McEwan]] of plagiarism charges by sending a [[Typewriter|typewritten]] letter to his British publisher, which was published in the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper.<ref name=reynolds2006>{{cite news|last1=Reynolds|first1=Nigel|title=Recluse speaks out to defend McEwan|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1536152/Recluse-speaks-out-to-defend-McEwan.html|access-date=September 26, 2014|work=The Telegraph|date=December 6, 2006}}</ref>

===2010s===
In 2012, Pynchon's novels were released in e-book format, ending a long holdout by the author. Publisher Penguin Press reported that the novels' length and complex page layouts made it a challenge to convert them to a digital format. Though they had produced a promotional video for the June release, Penguin had no expectation Pynchon's public profile would change in any fashion.<ref>{{cite news |title=After Long Resistance, Pynchon Allows Novels to Be Sold as E-Books |url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/12/after-long-resistance-pynchon-allows-novels-to-be-sold-as-e-books/ |newspaper=The New York Times, Media Decoder blog |date=June 12, 2012 |author=Julie Bosman}}</ref>

In 2013, his son, Jackson Pynchon, graduated from [[Columbia University]], where he was affiliated with [[St. Anthony Hall]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Not-So-Secret Society|url=http://columbiaspectator.com/eye/2013/02/28/not-so-secret-society/|access-date=August 13, 2020|website=Columbia Daily Spectator}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Trotter|first=J.

In September 2014, [[Josh Brolin]] told ''The New York Times'' that Pynchon had made a cameo in the [[Inherent Vice (film)|''Inherent Vice'' film adaptation]]. This led to a sizable online hunt for the author's appearance, eventually targeting actor Charley Morgan, whose small role as a doctor led many to believe he was Pynchon. Morgan, son of ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]''{{'}}s [[Harry Morgan]], claimed that Paul Thomas Anderson, whom he described as a friend, had told him that such a cameo did not exist. Despite this, nothing has been directly confirmed by Anderson or [[Warner Bros. Pictures]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hendrickson|first1=John|title=We're Still Trying to Find the Thomas Pynchon Inherent Vice Cameo|url=http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/books/a31769/pynchon-inherent-vice-cameo/|website=Esquire|date=January 22, 2015|publisher=Esquire|access-date=November 16, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Daly|first1=Kyle|title=Maybe Thomas Pynchon wasn't in Inherent Vice after all|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/maybe-thomas-pynchon-wasnt-inherent-vice-after-all-220352|website=A.V.

On November 6, 2018, Pynchon was photographed near his apartment in New York's [[Upper West Side]] district when he went to vote with his son. The photo was published by the ''[[National Enquirer]]'' and was said to be the first photo of him "in decades".<ref>[https://elpais.com/cultura/2019/01/17/actualidad/1547740942_812934.html Cazar a Pynchon] El Pais January 17, 2019</ref>
