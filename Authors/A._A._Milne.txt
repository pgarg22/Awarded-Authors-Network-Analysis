'''Alan Alexander Milne''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɪ|l|n}}; 18 January 1882 – 31 January 1956) was an English author, best known for his books about the teddy bear [[Winnie-the-Pooh]] and for various poems. Milne was a noted writer, primarily as a playwright, before the huge success of Pooh overshadowed all his previous work. Milne served in both World Wars, joining the British Army in World War I, and as a captain of the [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|British Home Guard]] in World War II.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/A-A-Milne|title=A.A.

He was the father of bookseller [[Christopher Robin Milne]], upon whom the character [[Christopher Robin]] is based.

Considered a talented [[cricket]] fielder, Milne played for two amateur teams that were largely composed of British writers: the [[Allahakbarries]] and the [[Authors Cricket Club|Authors XI]]. His teammates included fellow writers [[J. M. Barrie]], [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] and [[P. G. Wodehouse]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8662375.stm "What is the connection between Peter Pan, Sherlock Holmes, Winnie the Pooh and the noble sport of cricket?]. BBC.

===1914-1945===
Milne joined the British Army in [[World War I]] and served as an officer in the [[Royal Warwickshire Fusiliers|Royal Warwickshire Regiment]] and later, after a debilitating illness, the [[Royal Corps of Signals]]. He was commissioned into the 4th Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment on 1 February 1915 as a [[second lieutenant]] (on probation).<ref name="LG 16 February 1915">{{London Gazette |issue=29070 |date=16 February 1915 |page=1563 }}</ref> His commission was confirmed on 20 December 1915.<ref>London Gazette. issue 29408 17 December 1915.

After the war, he wrote a denunciation of war titled ''Peace with Honour'' (1934), which he retracted somewhat with 1940's ''War with Honour''.<ref name="ODNBthwaite" /><ref>Capitalization as in the [[British Library]] Catalogue</ref> During World War II, Milne was one of the most prominent critics of fellow English writer (and Authors XI cricket teammate) P. G. Wodehouse, who was captured at his country home in France by the [[Nazism|Nazis]] and imprisoned for a year. Wodehouse made radio broadcasts about his internment, which were broadcast from Berlin. Although the light-hearted broadcasts made fun of the Germans, Milne accused Wodehouse of committing an act of near treason by cooperating with his country's enemy. Wodehouse got some revenge on his former friend (e.g. in ''[[The Mating Season (novel)|The Mating Season]]'') by creating fatuous parodies of the Christopher Robin poems in some of his later stories, and claiming that Milne "was probably jealous of all other writers.... But I loved his stuff."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theparisreview.com/media/3773_WODEHOUSE.pdf |title=The Art of Fiction – P.G.

Milne married Dorothy "Daphne" de Sélincourt (1890–1971) in 1913 and their son [[Christopher Robin Milne]] was born in 1920. In 1925, Milne bought a country home, [[Cotchford Farm]], in [[Hartfield]], [[East Sussex]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pastscape.english-heritage.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=618520#|title=Cotchford Farm|work=National Monument Records|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|access-date=29 September 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012054412/http://pastscape.english-heritage.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=618520|archive-date=12 October 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

During World War II, Milne was a captain in the [[British Home Guard]] in Hartfield & Forest Row, insisting on being plain "Mr. Milne" to the members of his platoon. He retired to the farm after a stroke and brain surgery in 1952 left him an invalid, and by August 1953, "he seemed very old and disenchanted."<ref>{{cite web | title=Letter La Z 5 July 1917 – John Middleton Murry to Beatrice Elvery |date=12 August 1953 |url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/lss/services/mss/collections/online-mss-catalogues/cats/laz4-5cat.html#laz57 |publisher=George Lazarus Collection |access-date=9 June 2008 }}</ref> Milne died in January 1956, aged 74.<ref>Jill C.

===1903 to 1925===

After graduating from Cambridge University in 1903, A. A. Milne contributed humorous verse and whimsical essays to ''Punch'',<ref>{{cite journal | last = Milne | first = A.

During this period he published 18 plays and three novels, including the murder mystery ''[[The Red House Mystery]]'' (1922). His son was born in August 1920 and in 1924 Milne produced a collection of children's poems, ''[[When We Were Very Young]]'', which were illustrated by ''Punch'' staff cartoonist [[E. H. Shepard]]. A collection of short stories for children ''[[A Gallery of Children]]'', and other stories that became part of the Winnie-the-Pooh books, were first published in 1925.

Milne was an early screenwriter for the nascent British film industry, writing four stories filmed in 1920 for the company Minerva Films (founded in 1920 by the actor [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]] and his friend and story editor [[Adrian Brunel]]). These were ''The Bump'', starring [[C. Aubrey Smith|Aubrey Smith]]; ''Twice Two''; ''Five Pound Reward''; and ''Bookworms''.<ref>{{cite book| last = Eforgan| first = E.| title = Leslie Howard: The Lost Actor| year = 2010| isbn = 978-0-85303-971-6 }}</ref> Some of these films survive in the archives of the [[British Film Institute]].

Looking back on this period (in 1926), Milne observed that when he told his agent that he was going to write a detective story, he was told that what the country wanted from a "''Punch'' humorist" was a humorous story; when two years later he said he was writing nursery rhymes, his agent and publisher were convinced he should write another detective story; and after another two years, he was being told that writing a detective story would be in the worst of taste given the demand for children's books. He concluded that "the only excuse which I have yet discovered for writing anything is that I want to write it; and I should be as proud to be delivered of a Telephone Directory ''con amore'' as I should be ashamed to create a Blank Verse Tragedy at the bidding of others."<ref name="RedHouseMystery_Intro">{{cite book |last=Milne |first=Alan Alexander |title=[[The Red House Mystery]] |orig-year=1922 |year=1926 |publisher=[[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]] |location=London |pages=ix–xii |chapter=Introduction (dated April 1926)}}</ref>

Milne is most famous for his two ''Pooh'' books about a boy named [[Christopher Robin]] after his son, [[Christopher Robin Milne]] (1920–1996), and various characters inspired by his son's stuffed animals, most notably the bear named [[Winnie-the-Pooh]].<ref name="vam.ac.uk">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vam.ac.uk/exhibitions/winnie-the-pooh-exploring-a-classic|title=V&A · Winnie-the-Pooh: Exploring a Classic|website=Victoria and Albert Museum|language=en|access-date=5 September 2018}}</ref> Christopher Robin Milne's stuffed bear, originally named Edward,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nypl.org/locations/tid/36/node/5557|title=The Adventures of the REAL Winnie-the-Pooh|website=The New York Public Library}}</ref> was renamed Winnie after a Canadian [[American Black Bear|black bear]] named [[Winnipeg (bear)|Winnie]] (after [[Winnipeg]]), which was used as a military mascot in World War I, and left to [[London Zoo]] during the war. "The Pooh" comes from a swan the young Milne named "Pooh". [[E. H. Shepard]] illustrated the original Pooh books, using his own son's teddy Growler ("a magnificent bear") as the model. The rest of Christopher Robin Milne's toys, [[Piglet (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Piglet]], [[Eeyore]], Kanga, Roo and [[Tigger]], were incorporated into A. A. Milne's stories,<ref name="Express"/><ref name = "birthday"/> and two more characters&nbsp;– Rabbit and Owl&nbsp;– were created by Milne's imagination.

The fictional [[Hundred Acre Wood]] of the Pooh stories derives from Five Hundred Acre Wood in [[Ashdown Forest]] in East Sussex, South East England, where the Pooh stories were set. Milne lived on the northern edge of the forest at Cotchford Farm, {{Coord| 51.090| 0.107|display=inline}}, and took his son walking there. E. H. Shepard drew on the landscapes of Ashdown Forest as inspiration for many of the illustrations he provided for the Pooh books. The adult Christopher Robin commented: "Pooh's Forest and Ashdown Forest are identical."<ref name="Express"/> Popular tourist locations at Ashdown Forest include: ''Galleon's Lap'', ''The Enchanted Place'', the ''[[Heffalump trap|Heffalump Trap]]'' and ''Lone Pine'', ''Eeyore’s Sad and Gloomy Place'', and the wooden ''Pooh Bridge'' where Pooh and Piglet invented [[Poohsticks]].<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-11380115 Plans to improve access to Pooh Bridge unveiled].

Not yet known as Pooh, he made his first appearance in a poem, "Teddy Bear", published in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine in February 1924 and republished in ''[[When We Were Very Young]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Celebrate Winnie-The-Pooh's 90th with a Rare Recording (And Hunny)|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/02/22/280761847/celebrating-winnie-the-poohs-90th-with-a-rare-recording-and-some-hunny|publisher=NPR|date=20 July 2015}}</ref> Pooh first appeared in the ''[[London Evening News]]'' on Christmas Eve, 1925, in a story called "The Wrong Sort of Bees".<ref name = "birthday">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4552940.stm "Pooh celebrates his 80th birthday"].

He also "gallantly stepped forward" to contribute a quarter of the costs of dramatising P. G. Wodehouse's ''A Damsel in Distress''.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9L2kjKQ8CvYC&pg=PA114|title=P.G.

===1929 onwards===
The success of his children's books was to become a source of considerable annoyance to Milne, whose self-avowed aim was to write whatever he pleased and who had, until then, found a ready audience for each change of direction: he had freed pre-war ''Punch'' from its ponderous facetiousness; he had made a considerable reputation as a playwright (like his idol [[J. M. Barrie]]) on both sides of the Atlantic; he had produced a witty piece of detective writing in ''[[The Red House Mystery]]'' (although this was severely criticised by [[Raymond Chandler]] for the implausibility of its plot in his essay ''[[The Simple Art of Murder]]'' in the eponymous collection that appeared in 1950). But once Milne had, in his own words, "said goodbye to all that in 70,000 words" (the approximate length of his four principal children's books), he had no intention of producing any reworkings lacking in originality, given that one of the sources of inspiration, his son, was growing older.

Another reason Milne stopped writing children's books, and especially about Winnie-the-Pooh, was that he felt "amazement and disgust" over the fame his son was exposed to, and said that "I feel that the legal Christopher Robin has already had more publicity than I want for him. I do not want CR Milne to ever wish that his name were Charles Robert."<ref>[http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160128-a-a-milne-and-the-curse-of-pooh-bear BBC – Culture – AA Milne and the curse of Pooh bear]</ref>

In his literary home, ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', where the ''When We Were Very Young'' verses had first appeared, Methuen continued to publish whatever Milne wrote, including the long poem "The Norman Church" and an assembly of articles entitled ''Year In, Year Out'' (which Milne likened to a benefit night for the author).<ref>Alan Hedblad (1998). "Something about the Author, Volume 100." p. 177. Gale,</ref>

In 1930, Milne adapted [[Kenneth Grahame]]'s novel ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'' for the stage as ''[[Toad of Toad Hall]]''.<ref>Jill C. Wheeler (2010). "A. A. Milne." p. 19.

Copyright Office, Library of Congress, 1940</ref>

Milne and his wife became estranged from their son, who came to resent what he saw as his father's exploitation of his childhood and came to hate the books that had thrust him into the public eye.<ref name="autobio2">{{cite book|title=The Enchanted Places|url=https://archive.org/details/enchantedplaces00miln|url-access=registration|last=Milne|first=Christopher|publisher=Eyre Methuen|year=1974|isbn=978-0-14-003449-3|location=London}}</ref> Christopher's marriage to his first cousin, Lesley de Sélincourt, distanced him still further from his parents – Lesley's father and Christopher's mother had not spoken to each other for 30 years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/what-to-read/i-knew-christopher-robin--the-real-christopher-robin/|title=The real Christopher Robin|last=Brandreth|first=Giles|work=The Telegraph|access-date=20 July 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/23/how-aa-milne-and-christopher-robin-fell-under-the-curse-of-pooh-bear|title=AA Milne, Christopher Robin and the curse of Winnie-the-Pooh|last=Boyce|first=Frank Cottrell|date=23 September 2017|website=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=5 September 2018}}</ref>

Several of Milne's children's poems were set to music by the composer [[Harold Fraser-Simson]]. His poems have been parodied many times, including with the books ''When We Were Rather Older'' and ''Now We Are Sixty''. The 1963 film ''[[The King's Breakfast (film)|The King's Breakfast]]'' was based on Milne's poem of the same name.<ref>[https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6ae20430 "The King's Breakfast (1963)"].

==Religious views==
Milne did not speak out much on the subject of religion, although he used religious terms to explain his decision, while remaining a pacifist, to join the [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|British Home Guard]]: "In fighting Hitler," he wrote, "we are truly fighting the Devil, the Anti-Christ ... Hitler was a crusader against God."<ref>{{cite book| last = Milne| first = Alan Alexander| author-link = A. A. Milne| title = War with Honour| publisher=Macmillan| year = 1940| location = London| pages = 16–17}}</ref>

His best known comment on the subject was recalled on his death:
{{quote|The Old Testament is responsible for more atheism, agnosticism, disbelief&nbsp;– call it what you will{{snd}}than any book ever written; it has emptied more churches than all the counter-attractions of cinema, motor bicycle and golf course.<ref>{{cite book|last=Simpson |first=James B. |title=Simpson's Contemporary Quotations |url=http://www.bartleby.com/63/93/4393.html |year=1988 |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]] |location=Boston, Massachusetts |isbn=0-395-43085-2 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122122546/http://www.bartleby.com/63/93/4393.html |archive-date=22 January 2009 }}</ref>}}

He wrote in the poem "Explained":

{{quote|<poem>Elizabeth Ann

"Please will you tell me how God began?
{{em|Somebody}} must have made Him. So
Who could it be, 'cos I want to know?"

He also wrote in the poem "Vespers":

{{quote|<poem>"Oh! Thank you, God, for a lovely day.
