'''Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset''' (1536{{snd}}19 April 1608) was an English statesman, poet, and dramatist. He was the son of [[Richard Sackville (escheator)|Richard Sackville]], a cousin to [[Anne Boleyn]]. He was a [[Member of Parliament]] and [[Lord High Treasurer]].

==Biography==
===Early life===

Thomas Sackville was born at Buckhurst, in the parish of Withyham, Sussex. His mother Winifrede was the daughter of Sir John Bridges, [[Lord Mayor of London]]. He was educated at [[St John's College, Cambridge]], where he obtained his M.A., and [[Hertford College, Oxford]].<ref>{{acad|id= SKVL571T|name=Sackville, Thomas}}</ref> He joined the [[Inner Temple]], and was [[Call to the bar|called to the bar]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=432}}

===Political career===
He first entered the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] in 1558 as one of the [[knight of the shire|knights of the shire]] for [[Westmorland (UK Parliament constituency)|Westmorland]]. In 1559 he was elected for [[East Grinstead (UK Parliament constituency)|East Grinstead]], and then in 1563 for [[Aylesbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Aylesbury]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1558-1603/member/sackville-thomas-15356-1608| title = History of Parliament| publisher= History of Parliament Trust|access-date = 2011-10-20}}</ref>

In 1566 Sackville travelled to [[Rome]], where he was arrested and detained as a prisoner for fourteen days, for reasons not clear, but at the time there was great tension between England and the Papacy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} His father died that year and he returned to England.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=432}} In 1567 he was created [[Baron Buckhurst]], of Buckhurst in the County of Sussex. His first important mission came in 1571, when he was sent to bear [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth's]] congratulations to [[Charles IX of France]] on his marriage to [[Elisabeth of Austria (1554–1592)|Elizabeth of Austria]], the daughter of the Emperor Maximilian, and more importantly to negotiate the matter of the proposed alliance between Queen Elizabeth and the [[Francis, Duke of Anjou|Duke of Anjou]], brother of the French king.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=432}}

In 1572, he was one of the peers who sat on the trial of [[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk]]. In 1579 he hosted the Scottish academic [[Hercules Rollock]] at [[Buckhurst Park, Sussex|Buckhurst Place]], and Rollock wrote Latin verses in praise of Sackville and his house.<ref>William Steven, ''The History of the High School of Edinburgh'' (Edinburgh, 1849), p.16: [https://www.dps.gla.ac.uk/electronic-resource/display/?pid=d2_RolH_008&aid=RolH Hercules Rollock, 'Sylva VI: ad Generosissimum equitem, Torquatum Thomam Sacvillum', Bridging the Continental Divide, University of Glasgow]</ref>

In 1586 he was selected to convey to [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], the sentence of death confirmed by the English Parliament. In 1587 he went as ambassador to the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]], upon their complaint against the [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Earl of Leicester]]; but, although he performed his trust with integrity, the favourite had sufficient influence to get him recalled; and on his return, he was ordered to confinement in his own house, for nine or ten months.<ref>[http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/sackbio.htm The Life of Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset (1536–1608)]. Luminarium.org. Retrieved 17 March 2011</ref> He incurred Queen Elizabeth's displeasure by what she called his "shallow judgement in diplomacy".{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} However his disgrace was short, for in 1588 he was presented with the [[Order of the Garter]], and was sent again to the Netherlands in 1589 and 1598.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=432}}

In 1591, Sackville was elected chancellor of the [[University of Oxford]]. In 1599 he succeeded [[William Cecil, Lord Burghley]], as [[Lord Treasurer]], a position he kept until his death, and was a capable, if uninspired, financial manager. In 1601 as high steward he pronounced sentence on the [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]], who had been his rival for the chancellorship and his opponent in politics.

[[James I of England|James I]] came south from Scotland in 1603 at the [[Union of the Crowns]]. Many courtiers travelled to Northamptonshire in June 1603 to greet [[Anne of Denmark]] and her children. Sackville wrote on 21 June 1603 that he and the [[Lord Keeper of the Great Seal|Lord Keeper]] [[Thomas Egerton, 1st Viscount Brackley|Thomas Egerton]] were travelling "to do our duties to the Queen, the Prince, and Princess, all the world flying beforehand to see her".<ref>''HMC Salisbury Hatfield'', vol. 20 (London, 1930), p. 144.</ref> In August 1603 he was working on the settlement and value of Anne of Denmark's jointure lands in England, in part based on that given to [[Catherine of Aragon]].<ref>''HMC Salisbury Hatfield'', vol. 20 (London, 1930), pp. 237, 240–1.</ref> Anne of Denmark sent the finished settlement to her brother [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] for his approval.<ref>''HMC Salisbury Hatfield'', vol. 20 (London, 1930), pp. 348-9: Edmund Lodge, ''Illustrations of British History'', vol. 3 (London, 1791), pp. 206–13.</ref>

King James confirmed him in the office of lord treasurer, and in 1604 he was created [[Earl of Dorset]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=432}}

In 1604, Sackville bought [[Groombridge Place]] in Kent. His other houses included [[Knole House]], in Sevenoaks, Kent, [[Michelham Priory]], in East Sussex, and [[Salisbury Square|Dorset House]], near Fleet Street, London, later burnt down in the [[Great Fire of London]].<ref>Henry Benjamin Wheatley, Peter Cunningham, ''London Past and Present: Its History, Associations, and Traditions'', [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yaRZ1cAMd2UC&lpg=PA515&dq=dorset%20house%20fleet%20street&pg=PA515#v=onepage&q=dorset%20house%20fleet%20street&f=false  p. 515]. Retrieved 15 July 2015.</ref> Queen Elizabeth acquired the manor of [[Bexhill-on-Sea|Bexhill]] in 1590 and granted it to Sackville. He was also the last Sackville to be lord of the manor of [[West Bergholt|Bergholt Sackville]] (named after the Sackville family) and [[Mount Bures]] in [[Essex]], which he sold in 1578 to one Alice Dister. Both properties had been in the Sackville family for 459 years.<ref>Jon Lander, ''A Thousand Years of Village News'', (Jon Lander, 1999), p. 15</ref> In August 1605 Dorset recommended [[John Thorpe|"Mr Thorpe"]] to survey and make "plots" for the rebuilding of [[Ampthill]] for [[Anne of Denmark]] and [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince Henry]].<ref>''HMC Salisbury Hatfield'', vol. 17 (London, 1938), pp. 349–50.</ref>

In April 1607 he wrote to [[George More]] of [[Loseley Park|Loseley]] asking him to influence the [[Margaret Clifford, Countess of Cumberland|Countess of Cumberland]] to arrange the marriage of her daughter [[Lady Anne Clifford, 14th Baroness de Clifford|Lady Anne Clifford]] to his grandson [[Richard Sackville, 3rd Earl of Dorset|Richard Sackville]].<ref>''HMC 7th Report (More Molyneux)'' (London, 1879), p. 668.</ref>

===Literary and commercial===
In addition to his political career, Sackville is remembered for his literary contributions.
With [[Thomas Norton]], he was an author in 1561 of the first English play to be written in [[blank verse]], ''[[Gorboduc (play)|Gorboduc]]'', which deals with the consequences of political rivalry. It was performed as part of the Christmas festivities (1560–1561) by the society of the Inner Temple, and afterwards on 18 January 1561 before Elizabeth at Whitehall.

He also contributed to the 1563 edition of ''[[The Mirror for Magistrates]]'', with the poem ''Complaint of Henry, Duke of Buckingham''. Sackville's first important literary work was the poem ''Induction'', which describes the poet's journey to the infernal regions, where he encounters figures representing forms of suffering and terror. The poem is noted for the power of its [[allegory]] and for its sombre stateliness of tone.

[[File:Dorsetarmour.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The armour of Thomas Sackville, made in the Greenwich Royal Workshops.]]
Sackville acquired a large fortune through his land dealings in many counties, as well as from his investments in the iron foundry business. He was an advocate of stronger enforcement of the [[sumptuary laws]], which regulated the types of clothing allowed to be worn by the various social classes, within the military. Specifically, he dictated that only soldiers holding the rank of [[colonel]] or above should be permitted to wear silk and velvet, and that [[Captain (land)|captains]] and all ranks below should "make do with [[fustian]] and spend the remaining money on their arms."<ref>Gravett, Christopher (2006). Tudor Knight. Oxford: Osprey Publishing. {{ISBN|1-84176-970-3}}.</ref>

In around 1587, Sackville was granted a royal licence to commission a suit of armour from the royal workshops at Greenwich. The finely etched, blued and gilt armour, a garniture for the field, is one of the finest and best-preserved examples of the Greenwich school of armour-making. It is now part of the Wallace Collection in London.<ref>Sir James Mann, ''Wallace Collection Catalogues: European Arms and Armour'' (London: The Wallace Collection, 1962), pp. 78–83, pls. 43–5.; A. V. B. Norman, ''Wallace Collection Catalogues: European Arms and Armour Supplement'' (London: The Wallace Collection, 1986), pp. 33–6.</ref> Another, similar suit of armour, featuring the same construction and decorative scheme, which belonged to [[Sir James Scudamore]], can be seen at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City|New York]].

He died suddenly at the council table, having apparently suffered a [[stroke]], referred to as "a dropsy on the brain". His funeral took place at Westminster Abbey, and he is buried in the Sackville family vault at Withyham parish Church, East Sussex.

==Family==
In 1555, Sackville married Cicely Baker, daughter of the leading politician [[John Baker (died 1558)|Sir John Baker]] and his second wife Elizabeth Dineley.<ref>[http://www.geneall.net/U/per_page.php?id=995343 Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset]</ref> They had seven children, including his heir [[Robert Sackville, 2nd Earl of Dorset|Robert]], and [[Sir William Sackville]], knighted by [[Henry IV of France]].<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=40547|title=Sackville, Sir William|first=Richard F.|last=Hardin}}</ref>

A daughter Anne married [[Henry Glemham (politician)|Sir Henry Glemham]], and Mary married [[Henry Nevill, 9th Baron Bergavenny|Lord Bergavenny]]. [[John Chamberlain (letter writer)|John Chamberlain]] recorded their reputation for learning in April 1606, as "complete women for learning, language, and all other rare qualities."<ref>Norman McClure, ''Letters of John Chamberlain'', vol. 1 (Philadelphia, 1939), p. 227.</ref>
