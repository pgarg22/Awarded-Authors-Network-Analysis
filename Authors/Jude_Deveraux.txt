==Literary work==
Known for her historical romances with storylines centered on strong, capable heroines, Deveraux has written stories set in several time periods, including post-Revolutionary America, nineteenth century Colorado, and nineteenth century New Mexico. Many of her books follow the Montgomery and Taggert families and contain recurring characters.

She has written several time-travel romances, and her later novels have had a contemporary setting. Many of her more recent books feature paranormal storylines.

In 2009, she was one of four authors who produced works for the debut of [[Vook]], a company which produces "video books" by combining text, video and internet links into a single experience.<ref name=Hybrid/><ref>{{cite news | title = NY publisher releases Deveraux novel as video book | date = October 1, 2009 | first = Hillel | last = Italie | agency = Associated Press | accessdate = 22 November 2010 | url = http://www.physorg.com/news173595695.html}}</ref>

Deveraux wrote ''A Girl From Summer Hill'', a contemporary reimagining of Jane Austen's ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' in 2016.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-101-88326-6 | title = Fiction Book Review: The Girl From Summer Hill By Jude Deveraux | work = [[Publishers Weekly]] | accessdate = 28 November 2016}}</ref><ref name=Hybrid>{{cite news | title = Curling Up With Hybrid Books, Videos Included | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/01/books/01book.html | last = Rich | first = Motoko | date = 30 September 2009 | work = New York Times | accessdate = 22 November 2010}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Deveraux was married to Richard Sides from 1967 to 1969.{{Citation needed|date=June 2021}} In the late 1960s, she met Claude White, whom she began living with in 1970. They married in 1987 and divorced in 1991. In 1991, while on a tour of Egypt with White, she met Mohammed Montassir. They eventually married and had a son together, named Sam Alexander Montassir.<ref>{{Cite web|last=McMahon|first=Paula|date=20 September 2013|title=Novelist's ex-husband testifies he had nothing to do with 'psychic' fraud|url=https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-2013-09-20-fl-jude-deveraux-ex-husband-20130920-story.html|url-status=live|access-date=4 June 2021|website=South Florida Sun Sentinel}}</ref> Their son died in 2005, at the age of eight, when he was hit by a truck near their home in North Carolina.<ref name="abcnewsfraud" />

=== Association with Rose Marks ===
In 1991, Deveraux first met [[psychic]] [[Rose Marks]], whom she knew as "Joyce Michael". She initially visited Marks for a psychic reading, due to problems with her marriage to White and with [[infertility]]. The relationship strengthened after Sam's death, and Marks isolated Deveraux from her friends and family. Marks offered her the ability to continue to contact her son as well as to save him from being "[[purgatory|caught between heaven and hell]]".<ref name="abcnewsfraud" />

Over the course of 17 years, Marks extracted between 17-20 million dollars from Deveraux, leaving her with almost no money despite her lucrative writing career. Marks told Deveraux as well as other victims that their money and valuables were cursed by malign influence and needed to be given to her for "cleansing rituals" and that they would be returned; yet the items never were returned. She was found guilty of fraud in a trial in 2013, and lost an appeal of her sentence in 2016.<ref name="abcnewsfraud">{{Cite web|title=Author Jude Deveraux Was Suicidal After Losing $20 Million to Fortune Telling Con|url=https://abcnews.go.com/US/author-jude-deveraux-lost-20-million-fortune-telling/story?id=14371150|access-date=2021-06-04|website=ABC News|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=McMahon|first=Paula|title=Convicted 'psychic' loses bid for new trial in $17M fraud case|url=https://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/fl-rose-marks-psychic-ruling-20161219-story.html|access-date=2021-06-04|website=sun-sentinel.com}}</ref>
