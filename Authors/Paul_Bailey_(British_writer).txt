''Kitty and Virgil'' (1998) is the story of the relationship between an Englishwoman and an exiled Romanian poet.

In his book "Chapman's Odyssey" (2011), the main character, Harry Chapman, in morphine-induced delirium, encounters characters from literature, writers, deceased friends and family members as he lies seriously ill in a London hospital.<ref name="Miller">Miller, Keith (2011) "[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/8257209/Chapmans-Odyssey-by-Paul-Bailey-review.html Chapman's Odyssey by Paul Bailey: review]", ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', 14 January 2011, retrieved 2011-07-04</ref> Despite his melancholy and fear, Harry entertains the nurses with recitations of some of the favourite poems he has memorised in a lifetime of reading. His latest book is "The Prince's Boy" (2014), a melancholic gay love story that spans four decades.

Bailey has also written plays for radio and television: ''At Cousin Henry's'' was broadcast in 1964 and his adaptation of [[J. R.
