Mary Rourke. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. August 3, 2007. California; Metro; Metro Desk; Part B; Pg. 8.</ref> "It was the best gift I ever received," Borchardt said in a 1999 interview with the ''[[Austin American-Statesman]]''.<ref name="obit" /> Her mother, Katherine, was a feminist who taught Alice to pursue her career goals.

The O'Brien family moved to [[Richardson, Texas]], when Alice was a teenager. She began her nursing career in Houston, where she met and married her husband,<ref name="obit" /> Cliff, and lived many years.<ref name=crider/>

After a 30-year career as a licensed vocational nurse, Borchardt faced staff reductions at the hospital where she worked.<ref name="obit" /> Her sister Anne, a successful writer since their mid-thirties, encouraged Alice, helped her find an agent, and wrote introductions to several of her books.<ref name="obit" />

==Literary career==

Borchardt was in her mid-50s when the first of her seven novels, ''Devoted'', was published by [[Dutton Penguin]] in 1995. She may be known best for the Legends of the Wolves trilogy about werewolves in medieval Rome (''The Silver Wolf'', ''Night of the Wolf'', and ''The Wolf King''). The orphaned Regeane and the nobleman Maeniel, both part wolf and part human, contend with bullying chieftains, embattled emperors and supernatural interventions. The last book in the series was published in 2001.<ref name="obit" />

==Books==
* ''Devoted'' ([[Dutton Penguin]], 1995)
* ''Beguiled'' (Dutton, 1996)
In the tenth-century French town of Chantalon, Bishop Owen and his lady, Elin, marshall their forces in a desperate struggle against Viking raiders, but when Owen leaves to seek aid from his kinsmen and is captured by Bretons, Elin is left to defend Chantalon alone.

;Legends of the Wolves trilogy
* ''[[The Silver Wolf]]'' ([[Del Rey Books]], 1998) 
An unwilling pawn in the plotting of the Rome of Charlemagne's time, Regeane is betrothed by her depraved uncle to an unknown barbarian lord. Unable to refuse lest he betray her as a shapeshifting wolf-woman, she is strangely attracted to a dark wolf prowling outside the city gates.
* ''Night of the Wolf'' (Del Rey, 1999) – prequel to ''The Silver Wolf''
As the powerful forces of a conquering Rome sweep across ancient Druidic Gaul, an epic battle erupts between the shapeshifter Maeniel, a werewolf, and Dryas, the powerful Druid priestess summoned to destroy him.
* ''[[The Wolf King]]'' (Del Rey, 2001)
This book features Regeane and her sworn shapeshifter mate, wolf-turned-man Maeniel, in Dark Ages Italy. In a cliffhanger opening, a runaway Saxon slave saves Regeane from death in an Alpine avalanche. When the two attempt to take refuge in a nearby monastery, they discover a mad abbott under the control of an invading demon spirit, the Bear, who leads a ragtag troop of bandits and monks turned zombies. Although they escape with Maeniel's help, the Bear follows, determined to possess a werewolf body and increase its power. Maeniel undertakes a mission from Charles (Charlemagne) to scout the geographical and political landscape ahead of the king's troops as Charles lays siege to Lombardy and its self-indulgent ruler, Desederius. In the meantime, Regeane's greedy cousin Hugo bargains with the Bear spirit and finds himself caught up in Desederius's plot to capture Maeniel. Fortunately, Regeane and the Saxon arrive in time to rescue him.
