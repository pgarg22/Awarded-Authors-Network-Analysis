In mid-1938, Wojtyła and his father left Wadowice and moved to [[Kraków]], where he enrolled at the [[Jagiellonian University]].

After his father's death, he started thinking seriously about the priesthood.{{sfn|Stourton|2006|p=63}} In October 1942, while the [[World War 2|war]] continued, he knocked on the door of the [[Bishop's Palace, Kraków|Archbishop's residence in Kraków]] and asked to study for the priesthood.{{sfn|Stourton|2006|p=63}} Soon after, he began courses in the [[Education in Poland during World War II|clandestine underground seminary]] run by the [[Archbishop of Kraków]], Cardinal [[Adam Stefan Sapieha]].

He spent two weeks there recovering from a severe [[concussion]] and a shoulder injury. It seemed to him that this accident and his survival was a confirmation of his vocation.

On the night of 17 January 1945, [[Vistula–Oder Offensive|the Germans fled the city]], and the students reclaimed the ruined [[seminary]].

== Priesthood ==

After finishing his studies at the seminary in Kraków, Wojtyła was [[ordination|ordained]] as a priest on [[All Saints' Day]], 1 November 1946,<ref name="CBN" /> by the Archbishop of Kraków, Cardinal Adam Stefan Sapieha.<ref name="ShortBio" />{{sfn|Stourton|2006|p=71}}<ref name="Vatican2" /> Sapieha sent Wojtyła to Rome's Pontifical International Athenaeum ''Angelicum'', the future [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas]], to study under the French [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friar [[Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange]] beginning on 26 November 1946. He resided in the [[Belgian Pontifical College]] during this time, under rectorship of [[Maximilien de Furstenberg]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://vaticancity.diplomatie.belgium.be/nl/belgen-in-rome | title=Belgen in Rome| date=4 April 2016}}</ref> Wojtyła earned a [[Licentiate of Sacred Theology|licence]] in July 1947, passed his doctoral exam on 14 June 1948, and successfully defended his doctoral thesis titled ''Doctrina de fide apud S. Ioannem a Cruce'' (The Doctrine of Faith in St. [[John of the Cross]]) in philosophy on 19 June 1948.<ref>{{cite news |title= His Holiness John Paul II, Biography, Pre-Pontificate| url = https://www.vatican.va/news_services/press/documentazione/documents/santopadre_biografie/giovanni_paolo_ii_biografia_prepontificato_en.html#1948 |access-date=6 October 2012}} Even though his doctoral work was unanimously approved in June 1948, he was denied the degree because he could not afford to print the text of his dissertation in accordance with the ''Angelicum'' rules. In December 1948 a revised text of his dissertation was approved by the theological faculty of Jagiellonian University in Kraków, and Wojtyła was finally awarded his doctoral degree.</ref> The ''Angelicum'' preserves the original copy of Wojtyła's typewritten thesis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pust.it/index.php?start=5&lang=en|title=Karol Wojtyla: A Pope Who Hails from the Angelicum (Città Nuova, Roma 2009)|publisher=Pust.it|access-date=23 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407161736/http://www.pust.it/index.php?start=5&lang=en|archive-date=7 April 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Among other courses at the ''Angelicum'', Wojtyła studied Hebrew with the Dutch Dominican Peter G.

According to Wojtyła's fellow student the future Austrian Cardinal [[Alfons Stickler]], in 1947 during his sojourn at the ''[[Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas|Angelicum]]'', Wojtyła visited [[Padre Pio]], who heard his confession and told him that one day he would ascend to "the highest post in the Church".<ref name="kwitny">{{cite book| last=Kwitny | first=Jonathan | title=Man of the Century: The Life and Times of Pope John Paul II | publisher=Henry Holt and Company | date=March 1997 | location=[[New York City|New York]] | page=768 | isbn=978-0-8050-2688-7 | url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780805026887 | url-access=limited }}</ref> Cardinal Stickler added that Wojtyła believed that the prophecy was fulfilled when he became a Cardinal.<ref name="cnn">{{cite news | last=Zahn | first=Paula | author-link=Paula Zahn | title=Padre Pio Granted Sainthood | publisher=CNN | date=17 June 2002 | url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0206/17/ltm.04.html | access-date=19 January 2008 }}</ref>

Wojtyła returned to Poland in the summer of 1948 for his first [[pastoral]] assignment in the village of [[Niegowić]], {{convert|15|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=off}} from Kraków, at the [[Church of the Assumption (Klodzko)|Church of the Assumption]]. He arrived at Niegowić at harvest time, where his first action was to kneel and kiss the ground.{{sfn|Maxwell-Stuart|2006|p=233}} He repeated this gesture, which he adopted from the French saint [[John Vianney|Jean Marie Baptiste Vianney]],{{sfn|Maxwell-Stuart|2006|p=233}} throughout his papacy.

In March 1949, Wojtyła was transferred to the parish of [[Saint Florian]] in [[Kraków]]. He taught ethics at [[Jagiellonian University]] and subsequently at the [[John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin|Catholic University of Lublin]]. While teaching, he gathered a group of about 20&nbsp;young people, who began to call themselves ''Rodzinka'', the "little family". They met for prayer, philosophical discussion, and to help the blind and the sick. The group eventually grew to approximately 200&nbsp;participants, and their activities expanded to include annual [[skiing]] and [[kayak]]ing trips.<ref name="USCCB_Bio" />

In 1953, Wojtyła's habilitation thesis was accepted by the Faculty of Theology at the Jagiellonian University. In 1954, he earned a [[Doctor of Sacred Theology|Doctorate in Sacred Theology]],{{sfn|Stourton|2006|p=97}} evaluating the feasibility of a Catholic ethic based on the ethical system of the [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologist]] [[Max Scheler]] with a dissertation titled "Reevaluation of the possibility of founding a Catholic ethic on the ethical system of Max Scheler"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.vatican.va/news_services/press/documentazione/documents/santopadre_biografie/giovanni_paolo_ii_biografia_prepontificato_en.html#1948 |title=Highlights on the life of Karol Wojtiła |publisher=Holy See Press Office |access-date=23 June 2013}}</ref> ({{lang-pl|Ocena możliwości zbudowania etyki chrześcijańskiej przy założeniach systemu Maksa Schelera}}).<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2QunKUmsM4kC&q=Ocena+&pg=PA153 |title=Destined for Liberty: The Human Person in the Philosophy of Karol Wojtyla/John Paul II |publisher=CUA Press |access-date=23 June 2013 |isbn=978-0-8132-0985-2 |year=2000}}</ref> Scheler was a German philosopher who founded a broad [[philosophical movement]] that emphasised the study of conscious experience. However, the Communist authorities abolished the Faculty of Theology at the Jagellonian University, thereby preventing him from receiving the degree until 1957.<ref name="Vatican2" /> Wojtyła developed a theological approach, called [[phenomenological Thomism]], that combined traditional Catholic [[Thomism]] with the ideas of [[personalism]], a philosophical approach deriving from phenomenology, which was popular among Catholic intellectuals in Kraków during Wojtyła's intellectual development. He translated Scheler's ''Formalism and the Ethics of Substantive Values''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Walsh |first=Michael |title=John Paul II: A Biography |year=1994 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=London |isbn=978-0-00-215993-7 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/johnpaulii0000wals/page/20 20–21] |url=https://archive.org/details/johnpaulii0000wals/page/20 }}</ref> In 1961, he coined "Thomistic Personalism" to describe Aquinas's philosophy.<ref>Wojtyla, Karol. "Thomistic Personalism." In ''Person and Community.'' Translated by Theresa Sandok, OSM. Pages 165–175. New York: Peter Lang, 1993. Originally published 1961 in Polish</ref>

During this period, Wojtyła wrote a series of articles in Kraków's Catholic newspaper, ''[[Tygodnik Powszechny]]'' ("''Universal Weekly''"), dealing with contemporary Church issues.<ref name="Zenit5" /> He focused on creating original [[Literature|literary work]] during his first dozen years as a priest. War, life under Communism, and his pastoral responsibilities all fed his poetry and plays. Wojtyła published his work under two pseudonyms—''Andrzej Jawień'' and ''Stanisław Andrzej Gruda''<ref name="Kuhiwczak" /><ref name="Zenit5" />—to distinguish his literary from his religious writings (issued under his own name), and also so that his literary works would be considered on their own merits.<ref name="Kuhiwczak" /><ref name="Zenit5" /> In 1960, Wojtyła published the influential theological book ''[[Love and Responsibility]]'', a defence of traditional Church teachings on marriage from a new philosophical standpoint.<ref name="Kuhiwczak" />{{sfn|Wojtyła|1981}}

While a priest in Kraków, groups of students regularly joined Wojtyła for hiking, skiing, bicycling, camping and kayaking, accompanied by prayer, outdoor Masses and theological discussions. In Stalinist-era Poland, it was not permitted for priests to travel with groups of students. Wojtyła asked his younger companions to call him "Wujek" (Polish for "Uncle") to prevent outsiders from deducing he was a priest. The nickname gained popularity among his followers. In 1958, when Wojtyła was named [[auxiliary bishop]] of Kraków, his acquaintances expressed concern that this would cause him to change. Wojtyła responded to his friends, "Wujek will remain Wujek," and he continued to live a simple life, shunning the trappings that came with his position as Bishop. This beloved nickname stayed with Wojtyła for his entire life and continues to be affectionately used, particularly by the Polish people.<ref>Witness to Hope; The Biography of Pope John Paul II, by George Weigel.

== Episcopate and cardinalate ==
[[File:Krakow Kanonicza19 C50.jpg|thumb|Where John Paul II once lived as priest and bishop on Kanonicza Street, Kraków (now an Archdiocese Museum)]]

=== Call to the episcopate ===
On 4 July 1958,<ref name="Vatican2" /> while Wojtyła was on a kayaking holiday in the lakes region of northern Poland, [[Pope Pius XII]] appointed him as an [[auxiliary bishop]] of Kraków. He was consequently summoned to Warsaw to meet the [[Primate (bishop)|Primate]] of Poland, Cardinal [[Stefan Wyszyński]], who informed him of his appointment.<ref name="Rise" />{{sfn|Stourton|2006|p=103}} Wojtyła accepted the appointment as auxiliary bishop to Kraków's [[Archbishop]] [[Eugeniusz Baziak]], and he received episcopal consecration (as titular bishop of [[Ombi]]) on 28 September 1958, with Baziak as the principal consecrator and as co-consecrators Bishop [[Bolesław Kominek]] (titular bishop of [[Sophene]] and [[Vågå]], auxiliary of the Catholic [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Wrocław|Archdiocese of Wrocław]], and Franciszek Jop, [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sandomierz|Auxiliary Bishop of Sandomierz]] (Titular Bishop of [[Daulia]]. Kominek was to become Cardinal [[Bishop of Wrocław|Archbishop of Wrocław]]) and Jop was later Auxiliary Bishop of Wrocław and then Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Opole|Opole]]).<ref name="Vatican2" /> At the age of 38, Wojtyła became the youngest bishop in Poland.

In 1959, Wojtyła began an annual tradition of saying a [[Midnight Mass]] on [[Christmas Day]] in an open field at [[Nowa Huta]], the so-called model workers' town outside Kraków that was without a church building.<ref>Weigel, George. Witness to Hope: The Biography of Pope John Paul II (p. 151). HarperCollins.

=== Participation in Vatican II and subsequent events ===
From October 1962, Wojtyła took part in the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962–1965),<ref name="A&E" /><ref name="Vatican2" /> where he made contributions to two of its most historic and influential products, the ''Decree on Religious Freedom'' (in Latin, ''[[Dignitatis humanae]]'') and the ''Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World'' (''[[Gaudium et spes]]'').<ref name="Vatican2" /> Wojtyła and the Polish bishops contributed a draft text to the Council for ''Gaudium et spes''. According to the [[Jesuit]] historian [[John W. O'Malley]], the draft text ''Gaudium et spes'' that Wojtyła and the Polish delegation sent "had some influence on the version that was sent to the council fathers that summer but was not accepted as the base text".<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Malley |first=John W. |title=What Happened at Vatican II |year=2008 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-674-03169-2 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/whathappenedatva00omal/page/204 204–205] |url=https://archive.org/details/whathappenedatva00omal/page/204 }}</ref> According to John F. Crosby, as pope, John Paul II used the words of ''Gaudium et spes'' later to introduce his own views on the nature of the human person in relation to God: man is "the only creature on earth that God has wanted for its own sake", but man "can fully discover his true self only in a sincere giving of himself".<ref>{{cite book |last=Crosby |first=John F. |year=2000 |title=John Paul II's Vision of Sexuality and Marriage: The Mystery of "Fair Love" |work=The Legacy of Pope John Paul II: His Contribution to Catholic Thought |page=54 |publisher=Crossroad |isbn=978-0-8245-1831-8 |editor-last=Gneuhs |editor-first=Geoffrey}}</ref>

He also participated in the assemblies of the [[Synod]] of Bishops.<ref name="A&E" /><ref name="ShortBio" /> On 13 January 1964, [[Pope Paul VI]] appointed him Archbishop of Kraków.<ref name="VaticanNewsService" /> On 26 June 1967, Paul VI announced Wojtyła's promotion to the [[College of Cardinals]].<ref name="Vatican2" /><ref name="VaticanNewsService" /> Wojtyła was named [[cardinal priest]] of the [[Titular church|titulus]] of [[San Cesareo in Palatio]].

In 1967, he was instrumental in formulating the [[encyclical]] ''[[Humanae vitae]]'', which dealt with the same issues that forbid [[abortion]] and [[birth control|artificial birth control]].<ref name="Vatican2" /><ref name="Memory" /><ref name="HV" />

According to a contemporary witness, Wojtyła was against the distribution of a letter around Kraków in 1970, stating that the Polish Episcopate was preparing for the 50th anniversary of the [[Polish–Soviet War]].

In 1973, Wojtyła met philosopher [[Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka]], the wife of [[Hendrik S. Houthakker]], professor of economics at [[Stanford University]] and [[Harvard University]], and member of President [[Richard M. Nixon|Nixon]]'s [[Council of Economic Advisers]]<ref name="Stourton">{{Cite news|last=Stourton|first=Ed|title = The secret letters of Pope John Paul II – BBC News|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35552997|website = BBC News|access-date = 15 February 2016|date=15 February 2016}}</ref><ref name="Guardian-letters">{{cite news|last1=Kirchgaessner|first1=Stephanie|title=Pope John Paul II letters reveal 32-year relationship with woman|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/15/pope-john-paul-ii-letters-reveal-32-year-relationship-with-woman|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=16 February 2016|date=15 February 2016}}</ref><ref name="Telegraph 2016" /> Tymieniecka collaborated with Wojtyła on a number of projects including an English translation of Wojtyła's book [[Pope John Paul II bibliography|''Osoba i czyn'']] (''Person and Act'').

During 1974–1975, Wojtyła served [[Pope Paul VI]] as consultor to the [[Pontifical Council for the Laity]], as recording secretary for the 1974 synod on evangelism and by participating extensively in the original drafting of the 1975 [[apostolic exhortation]], ''[[Evangelii nuntiandi]]''.<ref>Moreira Neves, Lucas Cardinal.

It was split between two strong [[Papabile|candidates for the papacy]]: Cardinal [[Giuseppe Siri]], the conservative [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Genoa|Archbishop of Genoa]], and the liberal [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Florence|Archbishop of Florence]], Cardinal [[Giovanni Benelli]], a close friend of John Paul I.<ref name="Time1978b" />

Supporters of Benelli were confident that he would be elected, and in early [[ballot]]s, Benelli came within nine votes of success.<ref name="Time1978b" /> However, both men faced sufficient opposition for neither to be likely to prevail. [[Giovanni Colombo]], the Archbishop of Milan was considered as a compromise candidate among the Italian cardinal-electors, but when he started to receive votes, he announced that, if elected, he would decline to accept the papacy.<ref>{{cite book |title=Inside the Vatican: The Politics and Organization of the Catholic Church |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FYMKOgA5lSAC |first=Thomas J. |last=Reese |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-674-93261-6 |pages=91, 99}}</ref> Cardinal [[Franz König]], [[Archbishop of Vienna]], suggested Wojtyła as another compromise candidate to his fellow electors.<ref name="Time1978b" /> Wojtyła won on the eighth ballot on the third day (16 October)—coincidentally the day that the American evangelical preacher [[Billy Graham]] had just concluded a 10-day pilgrimage to Poland—with, according to the Italian press, 99 votes from the 111 participating electors.

Among those cardinals who rallied behind Wojtyła were supporters of [[Giuseppe Siri]], [[Stefan Wyszyński]], most of the [[United States|American]] cardinals (led by [[John Krol]]), and other [[moderate]] cardinals. He accepted his election with the words: "With obedience in faith to Christ, my Lord, and with trust in the Mother of Christ and the Church, in spite of great difficulties, I accept".{{sfn|Stourton|2006|p=171}}<ref name="NewPope" /> The pope, in tribute to his immediate predecessor, then took the [[regnal name]] of ''John Paul II'',<ref name="Vatican2" /><ref name="Time1978b" /> also in honor of the late Pope Paul VI, and the traditional white smoke informed the crowd gathered in [[St. Peter's Square]] that a pope had been chosen. There had been rumors that the new pope wished to be known as ''Pope Stanislaus'' in honor of [[Stanislaus of Szczepanów|the Polish saint of the name]], but was convinced by the cardinals that it was not a Roman name.<ref name="Time1978" /> When the new pontiff appeared on the balcony, he broke tradition by addressing the gathered crowd:{{sfn|Stourton|2006|p=171}}

Wojtyła became the 264th pope according to the chronological [[list of popes]], the first non-Italian in 455 years.<ref name="upi" /> At only 58 years of age, he was the youngest pope since [[Pope Pius IX]] in 1846, who was 54.<ref name="Vatican2" /> Like his predecessor, John Paul&nbsp;II dispensed with the traditional [[papal coronation]] and instead received ecclesiastical [[investiture]] with a simplified [[papal inauguration]] on 22 October 1978. During his inauguration, when the cardinals were to kneel before him to take their vows and kiss his ring, he stood up as the Polish prelate, Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński knelt down, stopped him from kissing the ring, and simply embraced him.<ref name="Vatican-bio-en" />

During his pontificate, John Paul II made journeys to 129 countries,{{sfn|Maxwell-Stuart|2006|p=234}} travelling more than {{convert|1100000|km}} while doing so. He consistently attracted large crowds, some among the largest ever assembled in [[history of the world|human history]], such as the [[World Youth Day 1995|Manila World Youth Day]], which gathered up to four million people, the largest papal gathering ever, according to the Vatican.<ref name=BaltimoreSun>{{cite news |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-01-16/news/1995016078_1_pope-philippines-papal |title=Biggest Papal Gathering &#124; Millions Flock to Papal Mass in Manila, Gathering is Called the Largest the Pope Has Seen at a Service |agency=New York Times News Service |work=The Baltimore Sun |year=2012 |access-date=29 January 2012}}</ref><ref name="AsiaNews" /> John Paul II's earliest official visits were to the Dominican Republic and Mexico in January 1979.<ref name="CBN2" />
While some of his journeys (such as to the United States and the [[Holy Land]]) were to places previously visited by Pope Paul VI, John Paul II became the first pope to visit the [[White House]] in October 1979, where he was [[List of meetings between the Pope and the President of the United States|greeted warmly]] by then-President [[Jimmy Carter]].

He travelled to Haiti in 1983, where he spoke in [[Haitian Creole|Creole]] to thousands of impoverished Catholics gathered to greet him at the airport. His message, "things must change in Haiti," referring to the disparity between the wealthy and the poor, was met with thunderous applause.<ref name="Haiti: The Duvalier Years" /> In 2000, he was the first modern pope to visit Egypt,<ref name="PopeEgypt" /> where he met with the [[Coptic Orthodox Church|Coptic pope]], [[Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria|Pope Shenouda&nbsp;III]]<ref name="PopeEgypt" /> and the [[List of Greek Orthodox Patriarchs of Alexandria|Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria]].<ref name="PopeEgypt" /> He was the first Catholic pope to visit and pray in an Islamic mosque, in [[Damascus]], Syria, in 2001. He visited the [[Umayyad Mosque]], a former [[Christian Church|Christian church]] where [[John the Baptist]] is believed to be interred,<ref name="Mosque" /> where he made a speech calling for Muslims, Christians and Jews to live together.<ref name="Mosque" />

On 15 January 1995, during the X World Youth Day, he offered [[Catholic Mass|Mass]] to an estimated crowd of between five and seven million in [[Rizal Park|Luneta Park]],<ref name="AsiaNews" /> [[Manila]], Philippines, which was considered to be the largest single gathering in [[History of Christianity|Christian history]].<ref name="AsiaNews" /> In March 2000, while visiting [[Jerusalem]], John Paul became the first pope in history to visit and pray at the [[Western Wall]].<ref name="BBCIsrael" /><ref name="ADL2006" /> In September 2001, amid post-[[11 September attacks|11 September]] concerns, he travelled to Kazakhstan, with an audience largely consisting of Muslims, and to Armenia, to participate in the celebration of 1,700&nbsp;years of [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Christianity]].<ref name="NewYorkTimes3" />

In June 1979, John Paul II travelled to Poland, where ecstatic crowds constantly surrounded him.<ref name="OnThisDay" /> This first papal trip to Poland uplifted the nation's spirit and sparked the formation of the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] movement in 1980, which later brought freedom and [[human rights]] to his troubled homeland.<ref name="Memory" />
Poland's Communist leaders intended to use the pope's visit to show the people that although the pope was Polish it did not alter their capacity to govern, oppress, and distribute the goods of society. They also hoped that if the pope abided by the rules they set, that the Polish people would see his example and follow them as well. If the pope's visit inspired a riot, the Communist leaders of Poland were prepared to crush the uprising and blame the suffering on the pope.<ref name="Angelo M. Codevilla 2008">Angelo M. Codevilla, "Political Warfare: A Set of Means for Achieving Political Ends", in Waller, ed., ''Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare'' (IWP Press, 2008.)</ref>

{{quote|The pope won that struggle by transcending politics. His was what [[Joseph Nye]] calls '[[soft power]]' — the power of attraction and repulsion. He began with an enormous advantage, and exploited it to the utmost: He headed the one institution that stood for the polar opposite of the Communist way of life that the Polish people hated. He was a Pole, but beyond the regime's reach. By identifying with him, Poles would have the chance to cleanse themselves of the compromises they had to make to live under the regime. And so they came to him by the millions. They listened. He told them to be good, not to compromise themselves, to stick by one another, to be fearless, and that God is the only source of goodness, the only standard of conduct. 'Be not afraid,' he said. Millions shouted in response, 'We want God! We want God! We want God!' The regime cowered. Had the Pope chosen to turn his soft power into the hard variety, the regime might have been drowned in blood. Instead, the Pope simply led the Polish people to desert their rulers by affirming solidarity with one another. The Communists managed to hold on as despots a decade longer. But as political leaders, they were finished. Visiting his native Poland in 1979, Pope John Paul II struck what turned out to be a mortal blow to its Communist regime, to the Soviet Empire, [and] ultimately to Communism."<ref name="Angelo M. Codevilla 2008" />

According to [[John Lewis Gaddis]], one of the most influential historians of the [[Cold War]], the trip led to the formation of Solidarity and would begin the process of Communism's demise in Eastern Europe:

<blockquote> When Pope John Paul II kissed the ground at the Warsaw airport he began the process by which Communism in Poland—and ultimately elsewhere in Europe—would come to an end.<ref>[[John Lewis Gaddis]], ''The Cold War: A New History'', p. 193, Penguin Books (2006), {{ISBN|978-0-14-303827-6}}</ref></blockquote>

On later trips to Poland, he gave tacit support to the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] organisation.<ref name="Memory" /> These visits reinforced this message and contributed to the collapse of East European Communism that took place between 1989/1990 with the reintroduction of democracy in Poland, and which then spread through Eastern Europe (1990–1991) and South-Eastern Europe (1990–1992).<ref name="Bottum" />{{sfn|Maxwell-Stuart|2006|p=234}}<ref name="OnThisDay" /><ref name="CBCNews" /><ref name="Gorbachev" />

===World Youth Days===
As an extension of his successful work with youth as a young priest, John Paul II pioneered the international [[World Youth Day]]s. John Paul II presided over nine of them: [[Rome]] (1985 and 2000), [[Buenos Aires]] (1987), [[Santiago de Compostela]] (1989), [[Częstochowa]] (1991), [[Denver]] (1993), [[Manila]] (1995), [[Paris]] (1997), and [[Toronto]] (2002). Total attendance at these signature events of the pontificate was in the tens of millions.<ref name="ReferenceA">Weigel, George.

===Dedicated Years===

Keenly aware of the rhythms of time and the importance of anniversaries in the Church's life, John Paul II led nine "dedicated years" during the twenty-six and a half years of his pontificate: the Holy Year of the Redemption in 1983–84, the [[Marian Year]] in 1987–88, the Year of the Family in 1993–94, the three Trinitarian years of preparation for the [[Great Jubilee]] of 2000, the Great Jubilee itself, the Year of the Rosary in 2002–3, and the [[Year of the Eucharist]], which began on 17 October 2004, and concluded six months after the Pope's death.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Great Jubilee of 2000===

The [[Great Jubilee]] of 2000 was a call to the Church to become more aware and to embrace her missionary task for the work of [[New evangelization|evangelization]].

<blockquote>From the beginning of my Pontificate, my thoughts had been on this Holy Year 2000 as an important appointment. I thought of its celebration as a providential opportunity during which the Church, thirty-five years after the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council, would examine how far she had renewed herself, in order to be able to take up her evangelising mission with fresh enthusiasm.<ref>Novo Millenio Inuente §2</ref></blockquote>

John Paul II also made a pilgrimage to the [[Holy Land]] for the [[Great Jubilee]] of 2000.<ref name=Vatican3 /> During his visit to the Holy Land, John Paul II visited many sites of the [[Rosary]], including the following locations: [[Al-Maghtas|Bethany Beyond the Jordan (Al-Maghtas)]], at the [[Jordan River|Jordan river]], where [[John the Baptist]] baptized Jesus; [[Manger Square]] and the [[Church of the Nativity]] in the town of [[Bethlehem]], the location of Jesus' birth; and the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Jerusalem]], the site of Jesus' burial and resurrection.<ref name=Vatican5 /><ref name=Vatican4 /><ref name=Vatican6 /><ref name=Vatican7 />

== Teachings ==
{{Catholic philosophy |expanded=all}}
As pope, John Paul II wrote [[List of encyclicals of Pope John Paul II|14 papal encyclicals]] and taught about sexuality in what is referred as the "[[Theology of the Body]]". Some key elements of his strategy to "reposition the Catholic Church" were encyclicals such as ''[[Ecclesia de Eucharistia]]'', ''[[Reconciliatio et paenitentia]]'' and ''[[Redemptoris Mater]]''. In his ''At the beginning of the new millennium'' (''[[Novo Millennio Ineunte]]''), he emphasised the importance of "starting afresh from Christ": "No, we shall not be saved by a formula but by a Person." In ''The Splendour of the Truth'' (''[[Veritatis Splendor]]''), he emphasised the dependence of man on God and His Law ("Without the Creator, the creature disappears") and the "dependence of freedom on the truth". He warned that man "giving himself over to relativism and scepticism, goes off in search of an illusory freedom apart from truth itself". In ''[[Fides et Ratio]]'' (''On the Relationship between Faith and Reason'') John Paul promoted a renewed interest in philosophy and an autonomous pursuit of truth in theological matters. Drawing on many different sources (such as Thomism), he described the mutually supporting relationship between [[faith and rationality|faith and reason]], and emphasised that theologians should focus on that relationship. John Paul II wrote extensively about workers and the [[Catholic social teaching|social doctrine]] of the Church, which he discussed in three encyclicals: ''[[Laborem exercens]]'', ''[[Sollicitudo rei socialis]]'', and ''[[Centesimus annus]]''. Through his encyclicals and many [[General epistles|Apostolic Letters]] and Exhortations, John Paul II talked about the [[dignity]] and the equality of women.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pope John Paul II|title=Mulieris Dignitatem: Apostolic Letter on the Dignity and Vocation of Women|publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana|year=1988|url=http://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/apost_letters/1988/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_19880815_mulieris-dignitatem.html}}</ref> He argued for the importance of the family for the future of humanity.<ref name="Memory" /> Other encyclicals include ''The Gospel of Life'' (''[[Evangelium Vitae]]'') and ''Ut Unum Sint'' (''That They May Be One''). Though critics accused him of inflexibility in explicitly re-asserting Catholic moral teachings against [[abortion]] and [[euthanasia]] that have been in place for well over a thousand years, he urged a more nuanced view of [[Catholic Church and capital punishment|capital punishment]].<ref name="Memory" /> In his second encyclical ''[[Dives in misericordia]]'' he stressed that [[divine mercy]] is the greatest feature of [[God]], needed especially in modern times.

=== Social and political stances ===
{{Main|Social and political stances of Pope John Paul II}}
[[File:Ioannes Paulus II in Germany (1980).jpg|thumb|During a visit to [[West Germany]], 1980]]
John Paul II was considered a conservative on [[doctrine]] and issues relating to human [[sexual reproduction]] and the ordination of women.<ref name="Spiegel2" />

While he was visiting the United States in 1977, the year before becoming pope, Wojtyła said: "All human life, from the moments of conception and through all subsequent stages, is sacred."<ref name="Pope John Paul II Visits the US, 1977 Year in Review" />

A series of 129 lectures given by John Paul II during his Wednesday audiences in Rome between September 1979 and November 1984 were later compiled and published as a single work titled ''[[Theology of the Body]]'', an extended meditation on [[human sexuality]]. He extended it to the condemnation of abortion, euthanasia and virtually all [[capital punishment]],<ref name="pbs" /> calling them all a part of a struggle between a "[[culture of life]]" and a "culture of death".<ref>John Paul II. (1995). Evangelium Vitae. Vatican City: Libreria Editrice Vaticana, §95</ref> He campaigned for world debt forgiveness and [[social justice]].<ref name="Memory" /><ref name="Spiegel2" /> He coined the term "[[social mortgage]]", which related that all private property had a social dimension, namely, that "the goods of this are originally meant for all."<ref>article 42, Solicitudo Rei Socialis</ref> In 2000, he publicly endorsed the [[Jubilee 2000]] campaign on African [[debt relief]] fronted by Irish rock stars [[Bob Geldof]] and [[Bono]], once famously interrupting a [[U2]] recording session by telephoning the studio and asking to speak to Bono.<ref name="Pope phones Bono" />

John Paul II, who was present and very influential at the 1962–65 [[Second Vatican Council]], affirmed the teachings of that Council and did much to implement them. Nevertheless, his critics often wished that he would embrace the so-called "progressive" agenda that some hoped would evolve as a result of the Council. In fact, the Council did not advocate "progressive" changes in these areas; for example, they still condemned abortion as an unspeakable crime. John Paul II continued to declare that contraception, abortion, and homosexual acts were gravely sinful, and, with Joseph Ratzinger (future [[Pope Benedict XVI]]), opposed [[liberation theology]].

Following the Church's exaltation of the marital act of sexual intercourse between a baptised man and woman within sacramental marriage as proper and exclusive to the [[sacrament]] of marriage, John Paul II believed that it was, in every instance, profaned by contraception, abortion, divorce followed by a 'second' marriage, and by homosexual acts. In 1994, John Paul II asserted the Church's lack of authority to ordain women to the priesthood, stating that without such authority ordination is not legitimately compatible with fidelity to Christ. This was also deemed a repudiation of calls to break with the constant tradition of the Church by ordaining women to the priesthood.<ref name="VaticanOrdinatio" /> In addition, John Paul II chose not to end the discipline of mandatory priestly celibacy, although in a small number of unusual circumstances, he did allow certain married clergymen of other Christian traditions who later became Catholic to be ordained as Catholic priests.

=== Apartheid in South Africa ===
John Paul II was an outspoken opponent of [[apartheid in South Africa]]. In 1985, while visiting the [[Netherlands]], he gave an impassioned speech condemning apartheid at the [[International Court of Justice]], proclaiming that "No system of apartheid or separate development will ever be acceptable as a model for the relations between peoples or races."<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130309014419/http://articles.latimes.com/1985-05-13/news/mn-9935_1_afrikaners "Pope Attacks Apartheid in Speech at U.N. Court"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 13 May 1985</ref> In September 1988, John Paul II made a pilgrimage to ten Southern African countries, including those bordering South Africa, while demonstratively avoiding South Africa. During his visit to [[Zimbabwe]], John Paul II called for economic sanctions against South Africa's government.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/17/world/pope-s-south-africa-visit-honors-2-vows.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm Pope's "South Africa Visit Honors 2 Vows"] ''[[The New York Times]]'', 13 May 1995</ref> After John Paul II's death, both [[Nelson Mandela]] and [[Archbishop Desmond Tutu]] praised the pope for defending human rights and condemning economic injustice.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060718134841/http://www.southafrica.info/mandela/pope-050405.htm#.UHIDqMr4IsA Mandela 'deeply inspired' by Pope] [South Africa Info], 5 April 2005</ref>

=== Capital punishment ===
John Paul II was an outspoken opponent of the [[death penalty]], although previous popes had accepted the practice. At a papal mass in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], in the United States he said:

<blockquote>A sign of hope is the increasing recognition that the dignity of human life must never be taken away, even in the case of someone who has done great evil. Modern society has the means of protecting itself, without definitively denying criminals the chance to reform. I renew the appeal I made most recently at Christmas for a consensus to end the death penalty, which is both cruel and unnecessary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/node/1403 |title=Religious Views: Pope John Paul II's Statements on the Death Penalty |publisher=Death Penalty Information Center |access-date=3 November 2013}}</ref></blockquote>

During that visit, John Paul II convinced the then [[Governor (United States)|governor]] of Missouri, [[Mel Carnahan]], to reduce the death sentence of convicted murderer Darrell J. Mease to life imprisonment without parole.<ref>Trigilio Jr., Rev. John, Rev. Kenneth Brighenti and Rev. Jonathan Toborowsky. ''John Paul II for Dummies'', p. 140, John Wiley & Sons, 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-471-77382-5}}</ref> John Paul II's other attempts to reduce the sentence of [[death-row]] inmates were unsuccessful. In 1983, John Paul II visited [[Guatemala]] and unsuccessfully asked the country's president, [[Efraín Ríos Montt]], to reduce the sentence for six left-wing guerrillas sentenced to death.<ref>Virginia Garrard-Burnett. ''Terror in the Land of the Holy Spirit: Guatemala Under General Efrain Rios Montt, 1982–1983'', pp. 20–21, John Wiley & Sons, 2010 {{ISBN|978-0-19-537964-8}}</ref>

In 2002, John Paul II again travelled to Guatemala. At that time, Guatemala was one of only two countries in [[Latin America]] (the other being [[Cuba]]) to apply capital punishment. John Paul II asked the Guatemalan president, [[Alfonso Portillo]], for a moratorium on executions.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0802/p07s02-woam.html/(page)/3 |title=With Papal Prodding, Guatemala May End Executions |newspaper=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |date=24 May 2013 |access-date=3 November 2013}}</ref>

=== European Union ===
John Paul II pushed for a reference to Europe's Christian cultural roots in the draft of the [[European Constitution]]. In his 2003 [[apostolic exhortation]] ''[[Ecclesia in Europa]]'', John Paul II wrote that he "fully (respected) the secular nature of (European) institutions". However, he wanted the EU Constitution to enshrine religious rights, including acknowledging the rights of religious groups to organise freely, recognise the specific identity of each denomination and allow for a "structured dialogue" between each religious community and the EU, and extend across the European Union the legal status enjoyed by religious institutions in individual member states. "I wish once more to appeal to those drawing up the future European Constitutional Treaty so that it will include a reference to the religion and in particular to the Christian heritage of Europe," John Paul II said. The pope's desire for a reference to Europe's Christian identity in the Constitution was supported by non-Catholic representatives of the [[Church of England]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Churches]] from [[Russia]], [[Romania]], and [[Greece]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.eubusiness.com/topics/european-council/aggregator/113730 |title=Pope says EU constitution should cite Christian heritage |publisher=EU Business |date=28 June 2003 |access-date=14 November 2013}}</ref> John Paul II's demand to include a reference to Europe's Christian roots in the European Constitution was supported by some non-Christians, such as [[Joseph Weiler]], a practising [[Orthodox Jew]] and renowned constitutional lawyer, who said that the Constitution's lack of a reference to Christianity was not a "demonstration of neutrality," but, rather, "a [[Jacobin]] attitude".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/jewish-professor-defends-mention-of-christianity-in-euro-text |title=Jewish Professor Defends Mention of Christianity in Euro Text |publisher=[[Zenit News Agency]] |date=17 September 2003 |access-date=14 November 2013}}</ref>

At the same time, however, John Paul II was an enthusiastic supporter of [[European integration]]; in particular, he supported his native Poland's entry into the bloc. On 19 May 2003, three weeks before a referendum was held in Poland on EU membership, the Polish pope addressed his compatriots and urged them to vote for Poland's EU membership at St. Peter's Square in Vatican City State. While some conservative, Catholic politicians in Poland opposed EU membership, John Paul II said:

<blockquote>I know that there are many in opposition to integration. I appreciate their concern about maintaining the cultural and religious identity of our nation. However, I must emphasise that Poland has always been an important part of Europe. Europe needs Poland. The Church in Europe needs the Poles' testimony of faith. Poland needs Europe.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://euobserver.com/enlargement/11309 |title=Pope paves the way to Polish "Yes" vote |author=Marcin Frydrych |publisher=[[EUObserver.com]] |date=21 May 2003 |access-date=14 November 2013}}</ref></blockquote>

The Polish pope compared Poland's entry into the EU to the [[Union of Lublin]], which was signed in 1569 and united the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] into one nation and created an elective monarchy.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www2.tygodnik.com.pl/tp/2811/main01.php |title=Od Unii Lubelskiej do Unii Europejskiej |language=pl |trans-title=From the Union of Lublin to the European Union |author=Rev.

=== Evolution ===
On 22 October 1996, in a speech to the [[Pontifical Academy of Sciences]] [[wikt:plenary session|plenary session]] at the Vatican, John Paul&nbsp;II said of [[evolution]] that "this theory has been progressively accepted by researchers, following a series of discoveries in various fields of knowledge. The convergence, neither sought nor fabricated, of the results of work that was conducted independently is in itself a significant argument in favour of this theory." John Paul II's embrace of evolution was enthusiastically praised by American [[Paleontology|paleontologist]] and evolutionary biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/vaticanview.html|title=The Vatican's View of Evolution: Pope Paul II and Pope Pius|author=Doug Linder}}</ref> with whom he had an audience in 1984.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://people.com/archive/stephen-jay-gould-vol-25-no-22/ |first =Michelle|last = Green|title = Stephen Jay Gould: Driven By a Hunger to Learn and to Write|date= 1986|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110110195417/http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20093775,00.html|archive-date= 10 January 2011}}</ref>

Although generally accepting the theory of [[evolution]], John Paul II made one major exception—the [[Soul (spirit)|human soul]]. "If the human body has its origin in living material which pre-exists it, the spiritual soul is immediately created by [[God]]."<ref name="Evolution" /><ref name="NCSE" /><ref name="Tagliabue" />

=== Iraq War ===
In 2003 John Paul II criticised the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 US-led invasion of Iraq]], saying in his State of the World address "No to war! War is not always inevitable. It is always a defeat for humanity."<ref>John Paul II, "[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/2003/january/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_20030113_diplomatic-corps_en.html Address to the Diplomatic Corps]", Vatican, 13 January 2003 (Retrieved 7 February 2007).</ref> He sent [[Pio Laghi|Pio Cardinal Laghi]], the former [[Nunciature of the Holy See in Washington DC|Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to the United States]], to talk with [[George W. Bush]], the [[President of the United States|US president]], to express opposition to the war. John Paul II said that it was up to the United Nations to solve the international conflict through diplomacy and that a unilateral aggression is a [[crime against peace]] and a violation of [[international law]]. The pope's opposition to the [[Iraq War]] led to him being a candidate to win the 2003 [[Nobel Peace Prize]], which was ultimately awarded to [[Iran]]ian attorney/judge and noted human rights advocate, [[Nobel Peace Prize in 2003|Shirin Ebadi]].<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/10/09/1065601953306.html Pope Mooted for Nobel Peace Prize] ''[[The Age]]'', 9 October 2003</ref><ref>[http://www.deseretnews.com/article/515037715/Pope-John-Paul-II-is-the-favorite-to-win-Nobel-Peace-Prize.html?pg=all Pope John Paul II is the Favorite to Win Nobel Peace Prize] ''[[Deseret News]]'', 10 October 2003</ref>

=== Liberation theology ===
In 1984 and 1986, through Cardinal Ratzinger (future [[Pope Benedict XVI]]) as [[Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], John Paul II officially condemned aspects of liberation theology, which had many followers in Latin America.<ref name="Miami" />

Visiting [[Europe]], Salvadoran Archbishop [[Óscar Romero]] unsuccessfully attempted to obtain a Vatican condemnation of the right-wing [[El Salvador]]'s regime for violations of human rights during the [[Salvadoran Civil War]] and its support of [[death squads]], and expressed his frustration in working with clergy who cooperated with the government. He was encouraged by John Paul II to maintain episcopal unity as a top priority.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Beatification of Óscar Romero |url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-beatification-of-oscar-romero |work=The New Yorker |date=19 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=What Óscar Romero's Canonization Says About Pope Francis |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/11/the-martyr-and-the-pope/570835/ |work=The Atlantic |date=November 2018}}</ref>

In his travel to [[Managua]], Nicaragua, in 1983, John Paul II harshly condemned what he dubbed the "popular Church"<ref name="Miami" /> (i.e. "[[basic ecclesial community|ecclesial base communities]]" supported by the [[Latin American Episcopal Conference|CELAM]]), and the Nicaraguan clergy's tendencies to support the leftist [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinistas]], reminding the clergy of their duties of obedience to the [[Holy See]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Pope says taking sides in Nicaragua is peril to church |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/05/world/pope-says-taking-sides-in-nicaragua-is-peril-to-church.html |work=The New York Times |date=5 March 1983}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Their Will Be Done |url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/1983/07/their-will-be-done/ |work=Mother Jones |date=1983}}</ref><ref name="Miami" /> During that visit [[Ernesto Cardenal]], a priest and minister in the Sandinista government, knelt to kiss his hand. John Paul withdrew it, wagged his finger in Cardinal's face, and told him, "You must straighten out your position with the church."<ref name="Religion: Berating Marxism's False Hopes" />

=== Organised crime ===
John Paul II was the first pontiff to denounce [[Organized crime in Italy|Mafia]] violence in [[Southern Italy]]. In 1993, during a pilgrimage to [[Agrigento]], [[Sicily]], he appealed to the Mafiosi: "I say to those responsible: 'Convert! One day, the judgment of God will arrive!'" In 1994, John Paul II visited [[Catania]] and told victims of Mafia violence to "rise up and cloak yourself in light and justice!"<ref>{{cite web |author=Filip Mazurczak |url=http://www.firstthings.com/onthesquare/2013/05/the-priest-who-stood-up-to-mafia |title=The Priest Who Stood Up to the Mafia |publisher=[[First Things]] |date=24 May 2013 |access-date=2 November 2013}}</ref> In 1995, the Mafia bombed two historical churches in [[Rome]].

=== Persian Gulf War ===
Between 1990 and 1991, a 34-nation coalition led by the United States waged a war against [[Saddam Hussein]]'s [[Iraq]], which had invaded and annexed [[Kuwait]]. John Paul II was a staunch opponent of the [[Gulf War]]. Throughout the conflict, he appealed to the international community to stop the war, and after it was over led diplomatic initiatives to negotiate peace in the [[Middle East]].<ref>{{cite news |agency=Times Wire Services |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-04-01/news/mn-1253_1_gulf-war |title=Pontiff's Message Condemns Destruction of Gulf War |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=1 April 1991 |access-date=22 November 2013}}</ref> In his 1991 encyclical [[Centesimus annus|Centesimus Annus]], John Paul II harshly condemned the conflict:

<blockquote>No, never again [[war]], which destroys the lives of innocent people, teaches how to kill, throws into upheaval even the lives of those who do the killing and leaves behind a trail of resentment and hatred, thus making it all the more difficult to find a just solution of the very problems which provoked the [[war]].<ref>{{cite news |author=Drew Christiansen, SJ |url=http://americamagazine.org/issue/398/article/hawks-doves-and-pope-john-paul-ii |title=Hawks, Doves, and Pope John Paul II |work=[[America (Jesuit magazine)|America]] |date=12 August 2002 |access-date=22 November 2013}}</ref></blockquote>

In April 1991, during his ''[[Urbi et Orbi]]'' Sunday message at [[St. Peter's Basilica]], John Paul II called for the international community to "lend an ear" to "the long-ignored aspirations of oppressed peoples". He specifically named the [[Kurds]], a people who were fighting a [[civil war]] against Saddam Hussein's troops in Iraq, as one such people, and referred to the war as a "darkness menacing the earth". During this time, the Vatican had expressed its frustration with the international ignoring of the pope's calls for peace in the [[Middle East]].<ref>{{cite news |author=Clyde Haberman |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/01/world/pope-denounces-the-gulf-war-as-darkness.html |title=Pope Denounces Gulf War As "Darkness" |newspaper=The New York Times |date=1 April 1991 |access-date=22 November 2013}}</ref>

=== Rwandan genocide ===
{{see|Rwandan genocide}}
John Paul II was the first world leader to describe the massacre of [[Tutsis]] by [[Hutus]] in the mostly Catholic country of Rwanda as a [[genocide]], which occured n 1994. During the [[Rwandan Civil War|Rwandan Civil war,]] he called for a ceasefire and condemned the persecution for the Tutsis on 10 April and 15 May 1990.<ref>{{cite news|author=Dariusz Rosiak |url=http://tygodnik.onet.pl/wiara/arcybiskup-i-maczety/l2w2l |title=Arcybiskup i maczety |language=pl |trans-title=Archbishop and machetes |publisher=[[Tygodnik Powszechny]] |date=21 July 2013 |access-date=9 November 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109104402/http://tygodnik.onet.pl/wiara/arcybiskup-i-maczety/l2w2l |archive-date=9 November 2013 }}</ref> In 1995, during his third visit to [[Kenya]] before an audience of 300,000, John Paul II pleaded for an end to the violence in [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]], pleading for forgiveness and reconciliation as a solution to the genocide. He told Rwandan and Burundian refugees that he "was close to them and shared their immense pain". He said:

<blockquote>What is happening in your countries is a terrible tragedy that must end. During the African Synod, we, the pastors of the church, felt the duty to express our consternation and to launch an appeal for forgiveness and reconciliation. This is the only way to dissipate the threats of ethnocentrism that are hovering over Africa these days and that have so brutally touched Rwanda and [[Burundi Genocide|Burundi]].<ref>{{cite news |author=Donatella Lorch |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/20/world/pope-calls-for-end-to-killings-in-rwanda.html |title=Pope Calls for End to Killings in Rwanda |newspaper=The New York Times |date=20 September 1995 |access-date=9 November 2013}}</ref></blockquote>

=== Views on sexuality ===
{{Main|Theology of the Body}}
While taking a traditional position on [[human]] [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], maintaining the Church's moral opposition to [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] acts, John Paul&nbsp;II asserted that people with [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] inclinations possess the same inherent dignity and rights as everybody else.<ref name="Smith2010" /> In his book ''Memory and Identity'', he referred to the "strong pressures" by the [[European Parliament]] to recognise homosexual unions as an alternative type of family, with the right to adopt children. In the book, as quoted by [[Reuters]], he wrote: "It is legitimate and necessary to ask oneself if this is not perhaps part of a new ideology of evil, more subtle and hidden, perhaps, intent upon exploiting human rights themselves against man and against the family."<ref name="Memory" />{{sfn|Pope John Paul II|2005|p=12}} A 1997 study determined that 3% of the pope's statements were about the issue of sexual morality.<ref name="The Truth of Catholicism" />

In 1986, the Pope approved the release of a document from the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] regarding ''Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons''. While not neglecting to comment on [[homosexuality]] and moral order, the letter issued multiple affirmations of the dignity of homosexual persons.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19861001_homosexual-persons_en.html Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons Paragraphs 7, 10, 11, 13]</ref>

== Reform of canon law ==
{{Main|Canon law (Catholic Church)}}
John Paul II completed a full-scale reform of the Catholic Church's legal system, Latin and Eastern, and a reform of the Roman Curia.

On 18 October 1990, when promulgating the ''[[Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches]]'', John Paul II stated
{{quote|By the publication of this Code, the canonical ordering of the whole Church is thus at length completed, following as it does...the "[[Pastor Bonus|''Apostolic Constitution on the Roman Curia'']]" of 1988, which is added to both Codes as the primary instrument of the Roman Pontiff for 'the communion that binds together, as it were, the whole Church'<ref>Ap. Const. ''Sacri Canones''. Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, Latin-English Edition, New English Translation (Canon Law Society of America, 2001), page xxv. Cf. ''[[Pastor Bonus]]'' n. 2</ref>}}

In 1998 John Paul II issued the [[motu proprio]] ''[[Ad tuendam fidem]]'', which amended two canons (750 and 1371) of the 1983 Code of Canon Law and two canons (598 and 1436) of the 1990 Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches.

=== 1983 Code of Canon Law ===
{{Main|1983 Code of Canon Law}}
On 25 January 1983, with the Apostolic Constitution ''[[Sacrae disciplinae leges]]'' John Paul II promulgated the current Code of Canon Law for all members of the Catholic Church who belonged to the [[Latin Church]]. It entered into force the first Sunday of the following [[Advent]],<ref name=sacrae>Ap. Const. ''Sacræ Disciplineæ Leges''</ref> which was 27 November 1983.<ref>NYTimes.com, "[https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/27/us/new-canon-law-code-in-effect-for-catholics.html New Canon Law Code in Effect for Catholics]", 27 November 1983, accessed June-25-2013</ref> John Paul II described the new Code as "the last document of Vatican II".<ref name=sacrae /> [[Edward N.

=== ''Pastor bonus'' ===
{{Main|Pastor bonus}}
John Paul II promulgated the [[apostolic constitution]] ''[[Pastor bonus]]'' on 28 June 1988. It instituted a number of reforms in the process of running the [[Roman Curia]]. ''Pastor bonus'' laid out in considerable detail the organisation of the Roman Curia, specifying precisely the names and composition of each dicastery, and enumerating the competencies of each [[dicastery]]. It replaced the previous special law, ''Regimini Ecclesiæ universæ'', which was promulgated by Paul VI in 1967.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ncregister.com/blog/jimmy-akin/is-pope-francis-about-to-rip-up-the-vatican-constitution-12-things-to-know/ |title=Akin, Jimmy.

== ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' ==
{{Main|Catechism of the Catholic Church}}
On 11 October 1992, in his [[apostolic constitution]] ''Fidei depositum'' (''The Deposit of Faith''), John Paul ordered the publication of the ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]''.

He declared the publication to be "a sure norm for teaching the faith … a sure and authentic reference text for teaching Catholic doctrine and particularly for preparing local catechisms". It was "meant to encourage and assist in the writing of new local catechisms [both applicable and faithful]" rather than replacing them.

== Role in the collapse of dictatorships ==
John Paul II has been credited with inspiring political change that not only led to the collapse of Communism in his native Poland and eventually all of Eastern Europe, but also in many countries ruled by dictators. In the words of [[Joaquín Navarro-Valls]], John Paul II's press secretary:

<blockquote>The single fact of John Paul II's election in 1978 changed everything. In Poland, everything began. Not in East Germany or Czechoslovakia. Then the whole thing spread. Why in 1980 did they lead the way in Gdansk? Why did they decide, now or never? Only because there was a Polish pope. He was in Chile and Pinochet was out. He was in Haiti and Duvalier was out. He was in the Philippines and Marcos was out. On many of those occasions, people would come here to the Vatican thanking the Holy Father for changing things.<ref>Jonathan Kwitny, ''Man of the Century: The Life and Times of Pope John Paul II'', p. 592, Henry Holt and Co. (1997), {{ISBN|978-0-8050-2688-7}}</ref></blockquote>

=== Chile ===
Before John Paul II's pilgrimage to Latin America, during a meeting with reporters, he criticised [[Augusto Pinochet]]'s regime as "dictatorial". In the words of ''[[The New York Times]]'', he used "unusually strong language" to criticise Pinochet and asserted to journalists that the Church in Chile must not only pray, but actively fight for the restoration of democracy in Chile.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/01/world/pope-on-latin-trip-attacks-pinochet-regime.html?pagewanted=1 Pope, on Latin Trip, Attacks Pinochet Regime] ''The New York Times'', 1 April 1987</ref>

During his visit to Chile in 1987, John Paul II asked Chile's 31 Catholic bishops to campaign for free elections in the country.<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P2-1314763.html Pope Tells Chile's Bishops To Press for Free Elections; Pontiff Joins Pinochet on Palace Balcony] ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 3 April 1987 {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> According to [[George Weigel]] and Cardinal [[Stanisław Dziwisz]], he encouraged Pinochet to accept a democratic opening of the regime, and may even have called for his resignation.<ref>{{cite book|author=George Weigel |title=Biografía de Juan Pablo II—Testigo de Esperanza |language=es |trans-title=Biography of John Paul II—Witness to Hope |publisher=Editorial Plaza & Janés |year=2003 |isbn=978-84-01-01304-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/biografadejuanpa00geor |author-link=George Weigel }}; {{cite book|author=Heraldo Muñoz |title=The Dictator's Shadow: Life under Augusto Pinochet |page=[https://archive.org/details/dictatorsshadowl00muno_0/page/183 183] |publisher=Basic Books |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-465-00250-4 |url=https://archive.org/details/dictatorsshadowl00muno_0/page/183 |author-link=Heraldo Muñoz }}</ref> According to Monsignor Sławomir Oder, the postulator of John Paul II's [[beatification]] cause, John Paul's words to Pinochet had a profound impact on the Chilean dictator. The pope confided to a friend: "I received a letter from Pinochet in which he told me that as a Catholic he had listened to my words, he had accepted them, and he had decided to begin the process to change the leadership of his country."<ref>Slawomir Oder, ''Why He Is a Saint: The Life and Faith of Pope John Paul II and the Case for Canonisation'', p. 107–108, Rizzoli International Publications (2010), {{ISBN|978-0-8478-3631-4}}</ref>

During his visit to Chile, John Paul II supported the [[Vicariate of Solidarity]], the Church-led pro-democracy, anti-Pinochet organisation. John Paul II visited the Vicariate of Solidarity's offices, spoke with its workers, and "called upon them to continue their work, emphasizing that the Gospel consistently urges respect for human rights".<ref>Timmerman, Jacobo ''Chile: Death in the South'', p. 114, Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., 1987 {{ISBN|978-0-517-02902-2}}</ref> While in Chile, John Paul II made gestures of public support of Chile's anti-Pinochet democratic opposition. For instance, he hugged and kissed [[Carmen Gloria Quintana]], a young student who had been nearly burned to death by Chilean police and told her that "We must pray for peace and justice in Chile."<ref>[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-04-04/news/8701250770_1_chile-marxist-president-salvador-allende-water-cannons Papal Mass In Chile Erupts In Violence] ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', 4 April 1987</ref> Later, he met with several opposition groups, including those that had been declared illegal by Pinochet's government. The opposition praised John Paul II for denouncing Pinochet as a "dictator", for many members of Chile's opposition were persecuted for much milder statements. Bishop [[Carlos Camus]], one of the harshest critics of Pinochet's dictatorship within the Chilean Church, praised John Paul II's stance during the papal visit: "I am quite moved, because our pastor supports us totally. Never again will anyone be able to say that we are interfering in politics when we defend human dignity." He added: "No country the Pope has visited has remained the same after his departure. The Pope's visit is a mission, an extraordinary social catechism, and his stay here will be a watershed in Chilean history."<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/03/world/pinochet-foes-cheered-by-the-pope-s-presence.html?src=pm Pionchet's Foes Cheered by the Pope's Presence] ''The New York Times'', 3 April 1987</ref>

Some have erroneously accused John Paul II of affirming Pinochet's regime by appearing with the Chilean ruler in public. However, Cardinal [[Roberto Tucci]], the organiser of John Paul II's visits, revealed that Pinochet tricked the pontiff by telling him he would take him to his living room, while in reality he took him to his balcony. Tucci says that the pontiff was "furious".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://wyborcza.pl/1,76842,7396637,Dlaczego_Jan_Pawel_II_wyszedl_z_Pinochetem_na_balkon.html |title=Dlaczego Jan Paweł II wyszedł z Pinochetem na balkon |language=pl |trans-title=Why John Paul II went to the balcony of Pinochet |newspaper=[[Gazeta Wyborcza]] |date=24 December 2009 |access-date=22 October 2014 |archive-date=23 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023063249/http://wyborcza.pl/1,76842,7396637,Dlaczego_Jan_Pawel_II_wyszedl_z_Pinochetem_na_balkon.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== Haiti ===
John Paul II visited [[Haiti]] on 9 March 1983, when the country was ruled by [[Jean-Claude "Baby Doc" Duvalier]]. He bluntly criticised the poverty of the country, directly addressing [[Baby Doc]] and his wife, [[Michèle Bennett]] in front of a large crowd of Haitians:

<blockquote>Yours is a beautiful country, rich in human resources, but Christians cannot be unaware of the injustice, the excessive inequality, the degradation of the quality of life, the misery, the hunger, the fear suffered by the majority of the people.<ref>Riccardo Orizio, ''Talk of the Devil: Encounters with Seven Dictators'', p. 131, Walker & Company (2003), {{ISBN|978-0-8027-1416-9}}</ref></blockquote>

John Paul II spoke in French and occasionally in Creole, and in the homily outlined the basic human rights that most Haitians lacked: "the opportunity to eat enough, to be cared for when ill, to find housing, to study, to overcome illiteracy, to find worthwhile and properly paid work; all that provides a truly human life for men and women, for young and old." Following John Paul II's pilgrimage, the Haitian opposition to Duvalier frequently reproduced and quoted the pope's message. Shortly before leaving Haiti, John Paul II called for social change in Haiti by saying: "Lift up your heads, be conscious of your dignity of men created in God's image...."<ref>James Ferguson, ''Papa Doc, Baby Doc: Haiti and the Duvaliers'', p. 75-77, Basil Blackwell (1987), {{ISBN|978-0-631-16579-8}}</ref>

John Paul II's visit inspired massive protests against the Duvalier dictatorship. In response to the visit, 860 Catholic priests and Church workers signed a statement committing the Church to work on behalf of the poor.<ref>Douglas Bond, Christopher Kruegler, Roger S. Powers, and William B. Vogele, ''Protest, Power, and Change: An Encyclopedia of Nonviolent Action from ACT-UP to Women's Suffrage'', p. 227, Routledge (1997), {{ISBN|978-0-8153-0913-0}}</ref> In 1986, Duvalier was deposed in an uprising.

=== Paraguay ===
The collapse of the dictatorship of General [[Alfredo Stroessner]] of Paraguay was linked, among other things, to John Paul II's visit to the South American country in May 1988.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/19/world/pope-ending-trip-urges-justice-in-paraguay.html|title = Pope, Ending Trip, Urges Justice in Paraguay|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 19 May 1988|last1 = Suro|first1 = Roberto}}</ref> Since Stroessner's taking power through a [[coup d'état]] in 1954, Paraguay's bishops increasingly criticised the regime for human rights abuses, rigged elections, and the country's feudal economy. During his private meeting with Stroessner, John Paul II told the dictator:

<blockquote>Politics has a fundamental ethical dimension because it is first and foremost a service to man. The Church can and must remind men—and in particular those who govern—of their ethical duties for the good of the whole of society. The Church cannot be isolated inside its temples just as men's consciences cannot be isolated from God.<ref name="Willey">[[David Willey (journalist)|David Willey]], ''God's Politician: Pope John Paul II, the Catholic Church, and the New World Order'', p. 227, St. Martin's Press (1992), {{ISBN|978-0-312-08798-2}}</ref></blockquote>

Later, during a Mass, John Paul II criticised the regime for impoverishing the peasants and the unemployed, saying that the government must give people greater access to the land. Although Stroessner tried to prevent him from doing so, John Paul II met opposition leaders in the one-party state.<ref name="Willey" />

In 1984 the [[foreign policy of the Ronald Reagan administration]] saw opened diplomatic relations with the Vatican [[Holy See–United States relations|for the first time since 1870]]. In sharp contrast to the long history of strong domestic opposition, this time there was very little opposition from Congress, the courts, and Protestant groups.<ref>Andrew M. Essig, and Jennifer L. Moore. "US-Holy See Diplomacy: The Establishment of Formal Relations, 1984." ''Catholic Historical Review'' (2009) 95#4, pp. 741-764741-764.

The British historian [[Timothy Garton Ash]], who describes himself as an "agnostic liberal", said shortly after John Paul II's death:

<blockquote>No one can prove conclusively that he was a primary cause of the end of communism. However, the major figures on all sides—not just Lech Wałęsa, the Polish Solidarity leader, but also Solidarity's arch-opponent, General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]]; not just the former American president [[George H.W. Bush|George Bush Senior]] but also the former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev—now agree that he was. I would argue the historical case in three steps: without the Polish Pope, no Solidarity revolution in Poland in 1980; without Solidarity, no dramatic change in Soviet policy towards eastern Europe under Gorbachev; without that change, no velvet revolutions in 1989.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/apr/04/catholicism.religion13?INTCMP=SRCH |title=The first world leader |newspaper=The Guardian |date=4 April 2005 |access-date=4 November 2013}}</ref></blockquote>

In December 1989, John Paul II met with the Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] at the Vatican and each expressed his respect and admiration for the other. Gorbachev once said "The collapse of the [[Iron Curtain]] would have been impossible without John Paul II."<ref name="Bottum" /><ref name="CBCNews" /> On John Paul II's death, Mikhail Gorbachev said: "Pope John Paul&nbsp;II's devotion to his followers is a remarkable example to all of us."<ref name="Gorbachev" />{{sfn|Domínguez|2005}}

On 4 June 2004 US President [[George W. Bush]] presented the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], the United States' highest civilian honour, to John Paul&nbsp;II during a ceremony at the [[Apostolic Palace]]. The president read the citation that accompanied the medal, which recognised "this son of Poland" whose "principled stand for peace and freedom has inspired millions and helped to topple communism and tyranny".<ref name="Associated Press">{{cite news |url=http://www.cjonline.com/stories/101303/pag_pope.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040404041319/http://www.cjonline.com/stories/101303/pag_pope.shtml |archive-date=4 April 2004 |title=Poles worried, proud of Pope John Paul II 10/13/03 |agency=Associated Press |work=The Topeka Capital-Journal |date=3 April 2012 |access-date=28 January 2012}}</ref>
After receiving the award, John Paul&nbsp;II said, "May the desire for freedom, peace, a more humane world symbolised by this medal inspire men and women of goodwill in every time and place."<ref name="vatican1" />

=== Communist attempt to compromise John Paul II ===
In 1983 Poland's Communist government unsuccessfully tried to humiliate John Paul II by falsely saying he had fathered an illegitimate child. Section D of [[Służba Bezpieczeństwa]] (SB), the security service, had an action named "Triangolo" to carry out criminal operations against the Catholic Church; the operation encompassed all Polish hostile actions against the pope.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.canadafreepress.com/2006/axis101306.htm |title=Polish secret services played key part in criminal plot to kill John Paul II |newspaper=Canada Free Press |date=13 October 2006 |access-date=23 October 2014}}</ref>{{better source needed|date=April 2019}} Captain Grzegorz Piotrowski, one of the murderers of beatified [[Jerzy Popiełuszko]], was the leader of section D. They drugged Irena Kinaszewska, the secretary of the Kraków-based weekly Catholic magazine ''Tygodnik Powszechny'' where Karol Wojtyła had worked, and unsuccessfully attempted to make her admit to having had sexual relations with him.<ref name=sbd>{{cite news |url=http://wiadomosci.dziennik.pl/historia/aktualnosci/artykuly/439582,prowokacja-sluzby-bezpieczenstwa-plotki-o-dziecku-papieza.html |title=Nieślubne dziecko Jana Pawła II.

The SB then attempted to compromise Kraków priest Andrzej Bardecki, an editor of ''Tygodnik Powszechny'' and one of the closest friends of Cardinal Karol Wojtyła before he became pope, by planting false memoirs in his dwelling, but Piotrowski was exposed and the forgeries were found and destroyed before the SB could "discover" them.<ref name=sbd />

== Relations with other Christian denominations ==
John Paul&nbsp;II travelled extensively and met with believers from many divergent faiths. At the [[Day of Prayer|World Day of Prayer for Peace]], held in [[Assisi]] on 27 October 1986, more than 120 representatives of different religions and [[Christian denomination|denominations]] spent a day of fasting and prayer.<ref name="Pace preventiva" />

===Churches of the East===
Although the contact between the [[Holy See]] and many Christians of the East had never totally ceased, communion had been interrupted since ancient times. Again, the history of conflict in Central Europe was a complex part of John Paul II's personal cultural heritage which made him all the more determined to react so as to attempt to overcome abiding difficulties, given that relatively speaking the [[Holy See]] and the non-Catholic Eastern Churches are close in many points of faith.

==== Eastern Orthodox Church ====
{{Main|Pope John Paul II's relations with the Eastern Orthodox Church}}
In May 1999, John Paul II visited Romania on the invitation from Patriarch [[Teoctist Arăpaşu]] of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]]. This was the first time a pope had visited a predominantly Eastern Orthodox country since the [[East–West Schism|Great Schism]] in 1054.<ref name="Teoctist" /> On his arrival, the Patriarch and the [[President of Romania]], [[Emil Constantinescu]], greeted the pope.<ref name="Teoctist" /> The Patriarch stated, <blockquote>"The second millennium of Christian history began with a painful wounding of the unity of the Church; the end of this millennium has seen a real commitment to restoring Christian unity."<ref name="Teoctist" /></blockquote>On 23–27 June 2001, John Paul&nbsp;II visited Ukraine, another heavily Orthodox nation, at the invitation of the [[President of Ukraine]] and bishops of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]].<ref name="Ukraine" /> The Pope spoke to leaders of the All-Ukrainian Council of Churches and Religious Organisations, pleading for "open, tolerant and honest dialogue".<ref name="Ukraine" /> About 200 thousand people attended the liturgies celebrated by the Pope in [[Kyiv]], and the liturgy in [[Lviv]] gathered nearly one and a half million faithful.<ref name="Ukraine" /> John Paul&nbsp;II said that an end to the Great Schism was one of his fondest wishes.<ref name="Ukraine" /> Healing divisions between the Catholic and [[Eastern Orthodox Churches]] regarding Latin and [[Byzantine]] traditions was clearly of great personal interest. For many years, John Paul II sought to facilitate dialogue and unity stating as early as 1988 in ''Euntes in mundum'', "Europe has two lungs, it will never breathe easily until it uses both of them."

During his 2001 travels, John Paul&nbsp;II became the first pope to visit Greece in 1291 years.<ref name="Macedonian" /><ref name="Associated" /> In [[Athens]], the pope met with [[Archbishop Christodoulos of Athens|Archbishop Christodoulos]], the head of the [[Church of Greece]].<ref name="Macedonian" /> After a private 30-minute meeting, the two spoke publicly. Christodoulos read a list of "13 offences" of the Catholic Church against the Eastern Orthodox Church since the Great Schism,<ref name="Macedonian" /> including the pillaging of [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|Constantinople by crusaders]] in 1204, and bemoaned the lack of apology from the Catholic Church, saying "Until now, there has not been heard a single request for pardon" for the "maniacal crusaders of the 13th century".<ref name="Macedonian" />

The pope responded by saying "For the occasions past and present, when sons and daughters of the Catholic Church have sinned by action or omission against their Orthodox brothers and sisters, may the Lord grant us forgiveness", to which Christodoulos immediately applauded. John Paul&nbsp;II said that the sacking of Constantinople was a source of "profound regret" for Catholics.<ref name="Macedonian" /> Later John Paul II and Christodoulos met on a spot where [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]] had once preached to Athenian Christians. They issued a 'common declaration', saying <blockquote>"We shall do everything in our power, so that the Christian roots of Europe and its Christian soul may be preserved.... We condemn all recourse to violence, [[proselytism]] and [[fanaticism]], in the name of religion."<ref name="Macedonian" /> </blockquote>The two leaders then said the [[Lord's Prayer]] together, breaking an Orthodox taboo against praying with Catholics.<ref name="Macedonian" />

The pope had said throughout his pontificate that one of his greatest dreams was to visit Russia,<ref>{{cite news |title=The Distance Between the First and Third Rome |url=https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the-distance-between-the-first-and-third-rome?barrier=accesspaylog |work=[[Project Syndicate]] |date=12 January 2001}}</ref> but this never occurred. He attempted to solve the problems that had arisen over centuries between the Catholic and [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] churches, and in 2004 gave them a 1730 copy of the lost icon of [[Our Lady of Kazan]].

==== Armenian Apostolic Church ====
John Paul II was determined to maintain good relations with the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], whose separation from the [[Holy See]] dated to Christian antiquity. In 1996, he brought the Catholic Church and the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] closer by agreeing with Armenian Archbishop [[Karekin II]] on Christ's nature.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/apr/24/local/me-30550 |title=Pope to Make First Visit to Armenia |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=24 April 1999 |access-date=6 December 2014|agency=Associated Press }}</ref> During an audience in 2000, John Paul II and [[Karekin II]], by then the [[Catholicos of All Armenians]], issued a joint statement condemning the [[Armenian genocide]]. Meanwhile, the pope gave Karekin the relics of [[Gregory the Illuminator|St. Gregory the Illuminator]], the first head of the Armenian Church that had been kept in [[Naples]], [[Italy]], for 500 years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atour.com/~aahgn/news/20001111b.html |title=Pope John Paul II Recognises Armenian Genocide |publisher=Atour.com |date=10 November 2000 |access-date=6 December 2014}}</ref> In September 2001, John Paul II went on a three-day pilgrimage to [[Armenia]] to take part in an ecumenical celebration with [[Karekin II]] in the newly consecrated St. Gregory the Illuminator Cathedral in Yerevan. The two Church leaders signed a declaration remembering the victims of the Armenian genocide.<ref>George Weigel, ''The End and the Beginning: Pope John Paul II – The Victory of Freedom, the Last Years, the Legacy'', p. 283, Doubleday Religion (2010), {{ISBN|978-0-385-52480-3}}</ref>

===Protestantism===
Like his successors after him, John Paul II took a large number of initiatives to promote friendly relations, practical humanitarian cooperation and theological dialogue with a range of [[Protestant]] bodies. Of these the first in importance had to be with [[Lutheran]]ism, given that the contention with [[Martin Luther]] and his followers was the most significant historical split in Western Christianity.

==== Lutheranism ====
From 15 to 19 November 1980, John Paul II visited [[West Germany]]<ref name="Travels – Federal Republic of Germany 1980 – John Paul II – The Holy Father – The Holy See" /> on his first trip to a country with a large [[Lutheran]] [[Protestant]] population. In [[Mainz]], he met with leaders of the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]], and with representatives of other Christian denominations.

On 11 December 1983, John Paul II participated in an ecumenical service in the [[Christuskirche, Rome|Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome]],<ref name="Ökumenisches Treffen mit der evangelisch-lutherischen Gemeinde von Rom" /> the first papal visit ever to a Lutheran church. The visit took place 500 years after the birth of the German [[Martin Luther]], who was first an [[Order of Saint Augustine|Augustinian]] friar and subsequently a leading Protestant [[Reformation|Reformer]].

In his apostolic pilgrimage to Norway, Iceland, Finland, Denmark and Sweden of June 1989,<ref name="vatican" /> John Paul II became the first pope to visit countries with Lutheran majorities. In addition to celebrating Mass with Catholic believers, he participated in ecumenical services at places that had been Catholic shrines before the Reformation: [[Nidaros Cathedral]] in Norway; near St. Olav's Church at [[Þingvellir|Thingvellir]] in Iceland; [[Turku Cathedral]] in Finland; [[Roskilde Cathedral]] in Denmark; and [[Uppsala Cathedral]] in Sweden.

On 31 October 1999, (the 482nd anniversary of [[Reformation Day]], Martin Luther's posting of the [[The Ninety-Five Theses|95 Theses]]), representatives of the [[Catholic Church]]'s [[Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity]] and the [[Lutheran World Federation]] signed a [[Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification]], as a gesture of unity. The signing was a fruit of a theological dialogue that had been going on between the [[Lutheran World Federation]] and the [[Holy See]] since 1965.

==== Anglicanism ====
John Paul&nbsp;II had good relations with the [[Church of England]], as also with other parts of the [[Anglican Communion]]. He was the first reigning pope to travel to the United Kingdom, in 1982, where he met [[Queen Elizabeth&nbsp;II]], the [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]]. He preached in [[Canterbury Cathedral]] and received [[Robert Runcie]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. He said that he was disappointed by the Church of England's decision to [[Ordination of women in the Anglican Communion|ordain women]] and saw it as a step away from unity between the [[Anglican Communion]] and the Catholic Church.<ref name="Kirby" />

In 1980, John Paul II issued a [[Pastoral Provision]] allowing married former Episcopal priests to become Catholic priests, and for the acceptance of former [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] parishes into the Catholic Church. He allowed the creation of the a form of the [[Roman Rite]], known informally by some as the [[Anglican Use]], which incorporates selected elements of the Anglican [[Book of Common Prayer]] that are compatible with Catholic doctrine. He permitted Archbishop [[Patrick Flores]] of [[San Antonio]], Texas, to establish [[Our Lady of the Atonement Catholic Church]], together as the inaugural parish for the use of this hybrid liturgy.<ref name="Atonement" />

== Relations with Judaism ==
{{Main|Pope John Paul II and Judaism}}
[[Relations between Catholicism and Judaism]] improved dramatically during the pontificate of John Paul II.<ref name="Memory" /><ref name="ADL2006" /> He spoke frequently about the Church's relationship with the Jewish faith.<ref name="Memory" /> There can be little doubt that his attitude was shaped in part by his own experience of the terrible fate of the Jews in Poland and the rest of Central Europe in the 1930s and 1940s.

In 1979, John Paul II visited the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] in Poland, where many of his compatriots (mostly [[History of the Jews in Poland|Jews]]) had perished during the German occupation there in World War II, the first pope to do so. In 1998, he issued ''We Remember: A Reflection on the Shoah'', which outlined his thinking on [[the Holocaust]].<ref name="Cassidy" /> He became the first pope known to have made an official papal visit to a synagogue, when he visited the [[Great Synagogue of Rome]] on 13 April 1986.<ref name="AIJAC" /><ref name="www" />

On 30 December 1993, John Paul&nbsp;II established formal diplomatic relations between the Holy See and the [[State of Israel]], acknowledging its centrality in Jewish life and faith.<ref name="AIJAC" />

On 7 April 1994, he hosted the ''[[Papal Concert to Commemorate the Shoah|Papal Concert to Commemorate the Holocaust]]''. It was the first-ever Vatican event dedicated to the memory of the six million Jews murdered in World War II. This concert, which was conceived and conducted by US conductor Gilbert Levine, was attended by the Chief Rabbi of Rome [[Elio Toaff]], the President of Italy [[Oscar Luigi Scalfaro]], and survivors of the Holocaust from around the world. The [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]], actor Richard Dreyfuss and cellist Lynn Harrell performed on this occasion under Levine's direction.<ref name="Shoah Speech" /><ref name="Timeline" /> On the morning of the concert, the pope received the attending members of survivor community in a special audience in the Apostolic Palace.

In March 2000, John Paul&nbsp;II visited [[Yad Vashem]], the national Holocaust memorial in Israel, and later made history by touching one of the holiest sites in Judaism, the Western Wall in Jerusalem,<ref name="ADL2006" /> placing a letter inside it (in which he prayed for forgiveness for the actions against Jews).<ref name="BBCIsrael" /><ref name="ADL2006" /><ref name="AIJAC" /> In part of his address he said: <blockquote>"I assure the Jewish people the Catholic Church … is deeply saddened by the hatred, acts of persecution and displays of [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]] directed against the Jews by Christians at any time and in any place," </blockquote>and he added that there were <blockquote>"no words strong enough to deplore the terrible tragedy of the Holocaust."<ref name="BBCIsrael" /><ref name="ADL2006" /></blockquote>[[Cabinet of Israel|Israeli cabinet]] minister Rabbi [[Michael Melchior]], who hosted the pope's visit, said he was "very moved" by the pope's gesture.<ref name="BBCIsrael" /><ref name="ADL2006" />

<blockquote>It was beyond history, beyond memory.<ref name="BBCIsrael" /></blockquote>

<blockquote>We are deeply saddened by the behaviour of those who in the course of history have caused these children of yours to suffer, and asking your forgiveness we wish to commit ourselves to genuine brotherhood with the people of the Covenant.<ref name="Online News" /></blockquote>

In October 2003, the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) issued a statement congratulating John Paul II on entering the 25th year of his papacy. In January 2005, John Paul II became the first pope known to receive a [[priestly blessing]] from a rabbi, when Rabbis [[Benjamin Blech]], Barry Dov Schwartz, and Jack Bemporad visited the Pontiff at [[Clementine Hall]] in the Apostolic Palace.<ref name="PTWF" />

Immediately after John Paul II's death, the [[Anti-Defamation League]] said in a statement that he had revolutionised Catholic-Jewish relations, saying, "more change for the better took place in his 27-year Papacy than in the nearly 2,000 years before."<ref name="ADL2" /> In another statement issued by the Australia/Israel & Jewish Affairs Council, Director Dr Colin Rubenstein said, "The Pope will be remembered for his inspiring spiritual leadership in the cause of freedom and humanity. He achieved far more in terms of [[Christian–Jewish reconciliation|transforming relations]] with both the Jewish people and the State of Israel than any other figure in the history of the Catholic Church."<ref name="AIJAC" />

<blockquote> With Judaism, therefore, we have a relationship which we do not have with any other religion. You are our dearly beloved brothers, and in a certain way, it could be said that you are our ''elder'' brothers.<ref name="Quotes" /></blockquote>

In an interview with the Polish Press Agency, [[Michael Schudrich]], chief rabbi of Poland, said that never in history did anyone do as much for Christian-Jewish dialogue as John Paul II, adding that many Jews had a greater respect for the late pope than for some rabbis. Schudrich praised John Paul II for condemning anti-Semitism as a sin, which no previous pope had done.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.fakt.pl/zydzi-szanowali-JPII-bardziej-niz-rabinow,artykuly,101875,1.html |title=Żydzi szanowali JPII bardziej niż rabinów |language=pl |trans-title=Jews respect John Paul II more than the rabbis |date=21 April 2011 |publisher=Fakt |access-date=22 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109084810/http://www.fakt.pl/zydzi-szanowali-JPII-bardziej-niz-rabinow%2Cartykuly%2C101875%2C1.html |archive-date=9 November 2014 }}</ref>

On John Paul II's beatification the Chief Rabbi of Rome [[Riccardo Di Segni]] said in an interview with the Vatican newspaper ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'' that "John Paul II was revolutionary because he tore down a thousand-year wall of Catholic distrust of the Jewish world." Meanwhile, Elio Toaff, the former Chief Rabbi of Rome, said that:

<blockquote>Remembrance of the Pope Karol Wojtyła will remain strong in the collective Jewish memory because of his appeals to fraternity and the spirit of tolerance, which excludes all violence. In the stormy history of relations between Roman popes and Jews in the ghetto in which they were closed for over three centuries in humiliating circumstances, John Paul II is a bright figure in his uniqueness. In relations between our two great religions in the new century that was stained with bloody wars and the plague of racism, the heritage of John Paul II remains one of the few spiritual islands guaranteeing survival and human progress.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://swiat.newsweek.pl/zydzi--wyrazili-radosc--z-powodu-beatyfikacji-jana-pawla-ii,76146,1,1.html |title=Żydzi "wyrazili radość" z powodu beatyfikacji Jana Pawła II |language=pl |trans-title=Jews "expressed joy" because of the beatification of John Paul II |date=5 April 2011 |publisher=Fakt |access-date=8 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005133557/http://swiat.newsweek.pl/zydzi--wyrazili-radosc--z-powodu-beatyfikacji-jana-pawla-ii,76146,1,1.html |archive-date=5 October 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref></blockquote>

== Relations with other world religions ==

=== Animism ===
In his book-length interview ''[[Crossing the Threshold of Hope]]'' with the Italian journalist [[Vittorio Messori]] published in 1995, John Paul II draws parallels between [[animism]] and Christianity. He says:

<blockquote>… it would be helpful to recall … the animist religions which stress ancestor worship. It seems that those who practice them are particularly close to Christianity, and among them, the Church's missionaries also find it easier to speak a common language. Is there, perhaps, in this veneration of ancestors a kind of preparation for the Christian faith in the Communion of Saints, in which all believers—whether living or dead—form a single community, a single body? […] There is nothing strange, then, that the African and Asian animists would become believers in Christ more easily than followers of the great religions of the Far East.<ref>John Paul II. ''Crossing the Threshold of Hope'', p. 82, Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., 1994 {{ISBN|978-0-307-76457-7}}</ref></blockquote>

In 1985, the pope visited the African country of [[Togo]], where 60 per cent of the population espouses animist beliefs. To honour the pope, animist religious leaders met him at a Catholic Marian shrine in the forest, much to the pontiff's delight. John Paul II proceeded to call for the need for religious tolerance, praised nature, and emphasised common elements between animism and Christianity, saying:

<blockquote>Nature, exuberant and splendid in this area of forests and lakes, impregnates spirits and hearts with its mystery and orients them spontaneously toward the mystery of He who is the author of life. It is this religious sentiment that animates you and one can say that animates all of your compatriots.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/10/world/pope-visits-palace-in-togo-then-a-woman-s-mud-hut.html Pope Visits Palace in Togo, Then a Woman's Mud Hut] ''The New York Times'', 10 August 1985</ref></blockquote>

=== Buddhism ===
Tenzin Gyatso, the [[14th Dalai Lama]], visited John Paul&nbsp;II eight times. The two men held many similar views and understood similar plights, both coming from nations affected by Communism and both serving as heads of major religious bodies.<ref name="Dalai" /><ref name="Lama" /> As Archbishop of Kraków, long before the 14th Dalai Lama was a world-famous figure, Wojtyła held special Masses to pray for the Tibetan people's non-violent struggle for freedom from [[Maoist China]].<ref>Levi, Mons.

''John Paul II: A Tribute in Words and Pictures'', p. 165, William Morrow, 1999 {{ISBN|978-0-688-16621-2}}</ref> During his 1995 visit to [[Sri Lanka]], a country where a majority of the population adheres to [[Theravada Buddhism]], John Paul II expressed his admiration for Buddhism:

<blockquote>In particular I express my highest regard for the followers of Buddhism, the majority religion in Sri Lanka, with its … four great values of … loving kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy and equanimity; with its ten transcendental virtues and the joys of the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]] expressed so beautifully in the Theragathas. I ardently hope that my visit will serve to strengthen the goodwill between us, and that it will reassure everyone of the Catholic Church's desire for interreligious dialogue and cooperation in building a more just and fraternal world. To everyone I extend the hand of friendship, recalling the splendid words of the [[Dhammapada]]: "Better than a thousand useless words is one single word that gives peace...."<ref>{{cite web |url = http://old.usccb.org/comm/archives/1997/97-071a.shtml |title = Text of Bishop Brunett's Greetings |author = Brunett, Mons.

=== Islam ===
[[File:StJohnInUmmayad.jpg|thumb|John Paul II was the first [[Pope]] to enter and pray in a [[mosque]], visiting the tomb of John the Baptist at [[Umayyad Mosque]], Damascus.]]
John Paul&nbsp;II made considerable efforts to improve relations between Catholicism and Islam.<ref name="Crossing the Threshold of Hope" />

On 6 May 2001, he became the first Catholic pope to enter and pray in a mosque, namely the [[Umayyad Mosque]] in [[Damascus]], Syria. Respectfully removing his shoes, he entered the former [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine-era]] Christian church dedicated to [[John the Baptist]], who is also revered as a [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|prophet of Islam]]. He gave a speech including the statement:<blockquote>"For all the times that Muslims and Christians have offended one another, we need to seek forgiveness from the Almighty and to offer each other forgiveness."<ref name="Mosque" /> </blockquote> He also kissed the [[Qur'an]] while in [[Syria]], an act that made him popular among Muslims but disturbed many Catholics.<ref name="Akin" />

In 2004, John Paul&nbsp;II hosted the "[[Papal Concert of Reconciliation]]", which brought together leaders of Islam with leaders of the Jewish community and of the Catholic Church at the Vatican for a concert by the Kraków Philharmonic Choir from Poland, the [[London Philharmonic Choir]] from the United Kingdom, the [[Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra]] from the United States, and the Ankara State Polyphonic Choir of Turkey.<ref name="WQED" /><ref name="Concert" /><ref name="Philharmonic" /><ref name="Gazette" /> The event was conceived and conducted by Sir [[Gilbert Levine]], [[Order of St. Gregory the Great|KCSG]] and was broadcast throughout the world.<ref name="WQED" /><ref name="Concert" /><ref name="Philharmonic" /><ref name="Gazette" />

John Paul&nbsp;II oversaw the publication of the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]], which makes a special provision for Muslims; therein, it is written, "together with us they adore the one, merciful God, mankind's judge on the last day."<ref name="Catechism" />

=== Jainism ===
In 1995, John Paul II held a meeting with 21 [[Jainism|Jains]], organised by the [[Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue]]. He praised [[Mohandas Gandhi]] for his "unshakeable faith in [[God]]", assured the Jains that the Catholic Church will continue to engage in dialogue with their religion and spoke of the common need to aid the poor. The Jain leaders were impressed with the pope's "transparency and simplicity", and the meeting received much attention in the [[Gujarat]] state in western India, home to many Jains.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ucanews.com/story-archive/?post_name=/1995/04/20/pope-impresses-jain-team-with-personal-warmth-encourages-more-dialogue&post_id=47157 |title=Pope Impresses Jain Team with Personal Warmth, Encourages More Dialogue |publisher=Ucanews.com |date=20 April 1995 |access-date=6 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213182603/http://www.ucanews.com/story-archive/?post_name=%2F1995%2F04%2F20%2Fpope-impresses-jain-team-with-personal-warmth-encourages-more-dialogue&post_id=47157 |archive-date=13 December 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

On the way to the hospital, he lost consciousness. Even though the two bullets missed his [[superior mesenteric artery|mesenteric artery]] and [[abdominal aorta]], he lost nearly three-quarters of his blood. He underwent five hours of surgery to treat his wounds.{{sfn|Time Magazine 1982-01-25|p=1}} Surgeons performed a [[colostomy]], temporarily rerouting the upper part of the [[large intestine]] to let the damaged lower part heal.{{sfn|Time Magazine 1982-01-25|p=1}} When he briefly regained consciousness before being operated on, he instructed the doctors not to remove his [[Scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel|Brown Scapular]] during the operation.<ref name="scapolare" /> One of the few people allowed in to see him at the [[Agostino Gemelli University Polyclinic|Gemelli Clinic]] was one of his closest friends [[philosopher]] [[Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka]], who arrived on Saturday 16 May and kept him company while he recovered from emergency surgery.<ref name="Telegraph 2016">[https://web.archive.org/web/20160216020844/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/bbc/12157733/What-really-happened-between-Pope-John-Paul-II-and-his-close-friend-Anna-Teresa-Tymienecka.html What really happened between Pope John Paul II and his close friend, Anna-Teresa Tymienecka?] by Edward Stourton, 15 February 2016, ''The Telegraph''</ref> The pope later stated that the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] helped keep him alive throughout his ordeal.{{sfn|Maxwell-Stuart|2006|p=234}}{{sfn|Dziwisz|2001}}{{sfn|Bertone|2000–2009}}

<blockquote>Could I forget that the event in St. Peter's Square took place on the day and at the hour when the first appearance of the Mother of Christ to the poor little peasants has been remembered for over sixty years at Fátima, Portugal? For in everything that happened to me on that very day, I felt that extraordinary motherly protection and care, which turned out to be stronger than the deadly bullet.{{sfn|Pope John Paul II|2005|p=184}}</blockquote>

Ağca was caught and restrained by a nun and other bystanders until police arrived. He was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]]. Two days after Christmas in 1983, John Paul II visited Ağca in prison. John Paul II and Ağca spoke privately for about twenty minutes.{{sfn|Maxwell-Stuart|2006|p=234}}{{sfn|Dziwisz|2001}} John Paul II said, "What we talked about will have to remain a secret between him and me. I spoke to him as a brother whom I have pardoned and who has my complete trust."

Numerous other theories were advanced to explain the assassination attempt, some of them controversial. One such theory, advanced by [[Michael Ledeen]] and heavily pushed by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|United States Central Intelligence Agency]] at the time of the assassination but never substantiated by evidence, was that the Soviet Union was behind the attempt on John Paul II's life in retaliation for the pope's support of Solidarity, the Catholic, pro-democratic Polish workers' movement.<ref name="SanFrancisco" /><ref name="ItalianPanel" /> This theory was supported by the 2006 [[Mitrokhin Commission]], set up by [[Silvio Berlusconi]] and headed by ''[[Forza Italia]]'' senator [[Paolo Guzzanti]], which alleged that Communist Bulgarian security departments were utilised to prevent the Soviet Union's role from being uncovered, and concluded that [[Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye|Soviet military intelligence ''(Glavnoje Razvedyvatel'noje Upravlenije)'']], not the KGB, were responsible.<ref name="ItalianPanel" /> Russian Foreign Intelligence Service spokesman Boris Labusov called the accusation "absurd".<ref name="ItalianPanel" /> The pope declared during a May 2002 visit to Bulgaria that the country's Soviet-bloc-era leadership had nothing to do with the [[List of people who survived assassination attempts|assassination attempt]].<ref name="SanFrancisco" /><ref name="ItalianPanel" /> However, his secretary, Cardinal Stanisław Dziwisz, alleged in his book ''A Life with Karol'', that the pope was convinced privately that the former Soviet Union was behind the attack.<ref name="Retire2" /> It was later discovered that many of John Paul II's aides had foreign-government attachments;<ref name="Thomas2000" /> Bulgaria and Russia disputed the Italian commission's conclusions, pointing out that the pope had publicly denied the Bulgarian connection.<ref name="ItalianPanel" />

A second assassination attempt was made on 12 May 1982, just a day before the anniversary of the first attempt on his life, in [[Fátima, Portugal|Fátima]], Portugal when a man tried to stab John Paul II with a [[bayonet]].<ref name="Krohn" /><ref name="CBC2" /><ref name="Reuters3" /> He was stopped by security guards. Stanisław Dziwisz later said that John Paul II had been injured during the attempt but managed to hide a non-life-threatening wound.<ref name="Krohn" /><ref name="CBC2" /><ref name="Reuters3" /> The assailant, a [[traditionalist Catholic]] Spanish priest named [[Juan María Fernández y Krohn]],<ref name="Krohn" /> had been ordained as a priest by Archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]] of the [[Society of St. Pius X|Society of Saint Pius X]] and was opposed to the changes made by the Second Vatican Council, saying that the pope was an agent of Communist Moscow and of the Marxist [[Eastern Bloc]].{{sfn|Hebblethwaite|1995|p=95}} Fernández y Krohn subsequently left the priesthood and served three years of a six-year sentence.<ref name="CBC2" /><ref name="Reuters3" />{{sfn|Hebblethwaite|1995|p=95}} The ex-priest was treated for [[mental illness]] and then expelled from Portugal to become a solicitor in Belgium.{{sfn|Hebblethwaite|1995|p=95}}

The [[Al-Qaeda]]-funded [[Bojinka plot]] planned to kill John Paul II during a visit to the Philippines during World Youth Day 1995 celebrations. On 15 January 1995 a [[suicide attack|suicide bomber]] was planning to dress as a priest and detonate a bomb when the pope passed in his [[motorcade]] on his way to the San Carlos Seminary in [[Makati]]. The assassination was supposed to divert attention from the next phase of the operation. However, a chemical fire inadvertently started by the cell alerted police to their whereabouts, and all were arrested a week before the pope's visit, and confessed to the plot.<ref name="ThePlot" />

In 2009 John Koehler, a journalist and former army intelligence officer, published ''Spies in the Vatican: The Soviet Union's Cold War Against the Catholic Church''.<ref name="Koehler2011" /> Mining mostly East German and Polish secret police archives, Koehler says the assassination attempts were "KGB-backed" and gives details.<ref>''Publishers Weekly'', review of 'Spies in the Vatican', 11 May 2009</ref> During John Paul II's papacy there were many [[cleric]]s within the Vatican who on nomination, declined to be ordained, and then mysteriously left the church. There is wide speculation that they were, in reality, [[KGB]] agents.

== Apologies ==

John Paul II apologised to many groups that had suffered at the hands of the Catholic Church through the years.<ref name="Memory" />{{sfn|Pope John Paul II|2005|p=1}} Before becoming pope he had been a prominent editor and supporter of initiatives such as the [[Letter of Reconciliation of the Polish Bishops to the German Bishops]] from 1965.

On 20 November 2001, from a laptop in the Vatican, John Paul II sent his first e-mail apologising for the [[Catholic sex abuse cases]], the Church-backed "[[Stolen Generations]]" of Aboriginal children in Australia, and to China for the behaviour of Catholic missionaries in [[Colonialism|colonial times]].<ref name="PopeApologises" />

[[File:PapstJPII20040922.jpg|thumb|An ailing John Paul II riding in the [[Popemobile]] in September 2004 in [[St. Peter's Square]]]]
When he became pope in 1978 at the age of 58, John Paul II was an avid sportsman. He was extremely healthy and active, jogging in the [[Gardens of Vatican City|Vatican gardens]], weight training, swimming, and hiking in the mountains. He was fond of football. The media contrasted the new pope's athleticism and trim figure to the poor health of John Paul I and Paul VI, the portliness of [[Pope John XXIII|John XXIII]] and the constant claims of ailments of Pius XII. The only modern pope with a fitness regimen had been [[Pope Pius XI]] (1922–1939), who was an avid mountaineer.<ref name="Ratti" /><ref name="Ratti2" /> An ''[[Irish Independent]]'' article in the 1980s labelled John Paul II the ''keep-fit pope''.

However, after over twenty-six years as pope, two assassination attempts, one of which injured him severely, and a number of cancer scares, John Paul's physical health declined. In 2001 he was diagnosed as suffering from [[Parkinson's disease]].<ref name="Parkinsons2001" /> International observers had suspected this for some time, but it was only publicly acknowledged by the Vatican in 2003. Despite difficulty speaking more than a few sentences at a time, trouble [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]], and severe [[osteoarthrosis]], he continued to tour the world although rarely walking in public.

John Paul II was hospitalised with breathing problems caused by a bout of [[influenza]] on 1 February 2005.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4228059.stm |title=Europe &#124; Pope John Paul rushed to hospital |work=BBC News |date=2 February 2005 |access-date=17 February 2013}}</ref> He left the hospital on 10 February, but was subsequently hospitalised again with breathing problems two weeks later and underwent a [[tracheotomy]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope_john_paul_resting_breathing_on_own_following_tracheotomy/ |title=Pope John Paul resting; breathing on own following tracheotomy |publisher=[[Catholic News Agency]] |date=25 February 2005 |access-date=17 February 2013}}</ref>

=== Final illness and death ===

On 31 March 2005, following a [[urinary tract infection]],{{sfn|BBC 2005-04-01}} he developed [[septic shock]], a form of infection with a high fever and low [[blood pressure]], but was not hospitalised. Instead, he was [[medical monitor|monitored]] by a team of consultants at his private residence. This was taken as an indication by the pope, and those close to him, that he was nearing death; it would have been in accordance with his wishes to die in the Vatican.{{sfn|BBC 2005-04-01}} Later that day, Vatican sources announced that John Paul II had been given the [[Anointing of the Sick]] by his friend and secretary Stanisław Dziwisz. The day before his death, one of his closest personal friends, [[Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka]] visited him at his bedside.<ref name="Stourton" /><ref name="Bernstein/Politi" /> During the final days of the pope's life, the lights were kept burning through the night where he lay in the Papal apartment on the top floor of the Apostolic Palace. Tens of thousands of people assembled and held vigil in St. Peter's Square and the surrounding streets for two days. Upon hearing of this, the dying pope was said to have stated: "I have searched for you, and now you have come to me, and I thank you."<ref name="LastWords" />

On Saturday, 2 April 2005, at approximately 15:30 [[Central European Summer Time|CEST]], John Paul II spoke his final words in [[Polish language|Polish]], ''"Pozwólcie mi odejść do domu Ojca"'' ("Allow me to depart to the house of the Father"), to his aides, and fell into a coma about four hours later.<ref name="LastWords" /><ref name="BBCLastWords" /> The Mass of the vigil of the Second Sunday of Easter commemorating the [[canonisation]] of Saint Maria Faustina on 30 April 2000, had just been celebrated at his bedside, presided over by Stanisław Dziwisz and two Polish associates. Present at the bedside was a cardinal [[Lubomyr Husar]] from Ukraine, who served as a priest with John Paul in Poland, along with Polish nuns of the Congregation of the Sisters Servants of the Most [[Sacred Heart]] of Jesus, who ran the [[Prefecture of the Pontifical Household|papal household]]. John Paul II died in his private apartment at 21:37 CEST (19:37 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) of heart failure from profound [[hypotension]] and complete [[circulatory collapse]] from septic shock, 46 days before his 85th birthday.<ref name="BBCLastWords" /><ref name="Pisa" />{{sfn|Navarro-Valls 2 April 2005}} His death was verified when an electrocardiogram that ran for 20 minutes showed a [[flatline]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Vatican Releases Official Record of Pope John Paul II's Final Days|date=19 September 2005|author=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/19/world/europe/vatican-releases-official-record-of-pope-john-paul-iis-final.html|access-date=29 January 2018|author-link=The New York Times}}</ref>
He had no close family by the time of his death; his feelings are reflected in his words written in 2000 at the end of [[Testament of Pope John Paul II|his Last Will and Testament]].{{sfn|Stourton|2006|p=320}} Stanisław Dziwisz later said he had not burned the pontiff's personal notes despite the request being part of the will.<ref>{{cite news |title=Pope aide 'has not burned papers' |work=BBC News |date=5 June 2005 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4610607.stm |access-date=12 August 2013}}</ref>

=== Aftermath ===

The death of the pontiff set in motion rituals and traditions dating back to medieval times. The Rite of Visitation took place from 4 April 2005 to 7 April 2005 at St. Peter's Basilica. John Paul II's testament, published on 7 April 2005,<ref name="Last Will" /> revealed that the pontiff contemplated being buried in his native Poland but left the final decision to The College of Cardinals, which in passing, preferred burial beneath St. Peter's Basilica, honouring the pontiff's request to be placed "in bare earth".

The Requiem Mass held on 8 April 2005 was said to have set world records both for attendance and number of [[head of state|heads of state]] present at a funeral.<ref name="MsnbcNews2" /><ref name="CNN" /><ref name="Independent" /><ref name="BBCMiracle" /> ''(See: [[List of dignitaries at the funeral of Pope John Paul II|List of Dignitaries]].)'' It was the single largest gathering of heads of state up to that time, surpassing the funerals of [[Funeral of Winston Churchill|Winston Churchill]] (1965) and [[Funeral of Josip Broz Tito|Josip Broz Tito]] (1980). Four kings, five queens, at least 70 presidents and prime ministers, and more than 14 leaders of other religions attended.<ref name="CNN" /> An estimated four million mourners gathered in and around Vatican City.<ref name="MsnbcNews2" /><ref name="Independent" /><ref name="BBCMiracle" /><ref name="Beltway" /> Between 250,000 and 300,000 watched the event from within the Vatican's walls.<ref name="BBCMiracle" />

The [[Dean of the College of Cardinals]], Cardinal [[Pope Benedict XVI|Joseph Ratzinger]], conducted the ceremony. John Paul II was interred in the [[grotto]]es under the basilica, the [[List of extant papal tombs|Tomb of the Popes]]. He was lowered into a tomb created in the same [[alcove (architecture)|alcove]] previously occupied by the remains of [[Pope John XXIII|John XXIII]]. The alcove had been empty since John XXIII's remains had been moved into the main body of the basilica after his beatification.

=== Title "the Great" ===
Upon the death of John Paul II, a number of clergy at the Vatican and laymen<ref name="Bottum" /><ref name="MsnbcNews2" /><ref name="Arlington" /> began referring to the late pontiff as "John Paul the Great" — in theory only the fourth pope to be so acclaimed.<ref name="Bottum" /><ref name="Arlington" /><ref name="OReilly-David" /><ref name="Murphy-Brian" /> [[Angelo Sodano|Cardinal Angelo Sodano]] specifically referred to John Paul as "the Great" in his published written [[homily]] for the pope's funeral [[Funeral of Pope John Paul II|Mass of Repose]].<ref name="FirstSpeech" /><ref name="Homily" /> The South African Catholic newspaper ''The Southern Cross'' has referred to him in print as "John Paul II the Great".<ref name="Southern" /> Some Catholic educational institutions in the US have additionally changed their names to incorporate "the Great", including [[John Paul the Great Catholic University]] and schools called some variant of [[John Paul the Great High School (disambiguation)|John Paul the Great High School]]<!--variants with saint, pope, ii, or catholic-->.

Scholars of [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] say that there is no official process for declaring a pope "Great"; the title simply establishes itself through popular and continued usage,<ref name="MsnbcNews2" /><ref name="Noonan" /><ref name="Noonan2" /> as was the case with celebrated secular leaders (for example, Alexander III of Macedon became popularly known as [[Alexander the Great]]). The three popes who today commonly are known as "Great" are [[Pope Leo I|Leo I]], who reigned from 440–461 and persuaded [[Attila the Hun]] to withdraw from Rome; [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory I]], 590–604, after whom the [[Gregorian chant|Gregorian Chant]] is named; and [[Pope Nicholas I]], 858–867, who consolidated the Catholic Church in the [[Western world]] in the [[Middle Ages]].<ref name="Arlington" />

John Paul's successor, Benedict XVI, has not used the term directly in public speeches, but has made oblique references to "the great Pope John Paul&nbsp;II" in his first address from the [[loggia]] of St. Peter's Basilica, at the [[World Youth Day 2005|20th World Youth Day]] in Germany 2005 when he said in Polish: "As the great Pope John Paul&nbsp;II would say: Keep the flame of faith alive in your lives and your people";<ref>Susan Crimp, "The Last Wish of Pope John Paul II: The Life and Messages of Saint Faustina", p92</ref> and in May 2006 during a visit to Poland where he repeatedly made references to "the great John Paul" and "my great predecessor".<ref name="Poland2006" />

("[Make him a] Saint Immediately!") from the crowds gathered during the funeral Mass that he celebrated,<ref name="Moore1" /><ref name="Hollingshead" /><ref name="Hooper1" /><ref name="Hope" /> Benedict XVI began the beatification process for his predecessor, bypassing the normal restriction that five years must pass after a person's death before beginning the beatification process.<ref name="Hollingshead" /><ref name="Hooper1" /><ref name="Canonisation" /><ref name="Metro" /> In an audience with Pope Benedict XVI, [[Camillo Ruini]], Vicar General of the Diocese of Rome, who was responsible for promoting the cause for canonisation of any person who died within that diocese, cited "exceptional circumstances", which suggested that the waiting period could be waived.<ref name="ShortBio" /><ref name="MsnbcNews2" /><ref name="Zenit3" /> This decision was announced on 13 May 2005, the Feast of Our Lady of Fátima and the 24th anniversary of the assassination attempt on John Paul II at St. Peter's Square.<ref name="catholicnewsagency" />

In early 2006, it was reported that the Vatican was investigating a possible [[miracle]] associated with John Paul II. [[Sister Marie Simon-Pierre]], a French nun and member of the Congregation of Little Sisters of Catholic Maternity Wards, confined to her bed by
Parkinson's disease,<ref name="Hooper1" /><ref name="Vicariato" /> was reported to have experienced a "complete and lasting cure after members of her community prayed for the intercession of Pope John Paul II".<ref name="NYTimes" /><ref name="MsnbcNews2" /><ref name="Moore1" /><ref name="Hooper1" /><ref name="ABC" /><ref name="Trinity" /> {{As of|2008|5}}, Sister Marie-Simon-Pierre, then 46,<ref name="Moore1" /><ref name="Hooper1" /> was working again at a [[Obstetrics|maternity hospital]] run by her [[religious institute]].<ref name="Metro" /><ref name="Vicariato" /><ref name="Miracle-americancatholic" /><ref name="Willan" />

"I was sick and now I am cured," she told reporter Gerry Shaw. "I am cured, but it is up to the church to say whether it was a miracle or not."<ref name="Vicariato" /><ref name="Miracle-americancatholic" />

On 28 May 2006, Pope Benedict XVI celebrated Mass before an estimated 900,000 people in John Paul II's native Poland. During his [[homily]], he encouraged prayers for the early canonisation of John Paul II and stated that he hoped canonisation would happen "in the near future".<ref name="Vicariato" /><ref name="Homily-Blonie-Park" />

In January 2007, Cardinal Stanisław Dziwisz announced that the interview phase of the beatification process, in Italy and Poland, was nearing completion.<ref name="MsnbcNews2" /><ref name="Vicariato" /><ref name="Westcott" /> In February 2007, [[Relics#Classification and prohibitions in the Catholic Church|second class relics]] of John Paul II—pieces of white papal [[cassock]]s he used to wear—were freely distributed with prayer cards for the cause, a typical pious practice after a saintly Catholic's death.<ref name="MMoore" /><ref name="Cause" /> On 8 March 2007, the [[Cardinal Vicar|Vicariate of Rome]] announced that the diocesan phase of John Paul's cause for beatification was at an end. Following a ceremony on 2 April 2007—the second anniversary of the Pontiff's death—the cause proceeded to the scrutiny of the committee of lay, clerical, and episcopal members of the Vatican's [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]], to conduct a separate investigation.<ref name="Hollingshead" /><ref name="Vicariato" /><ref name="Westcott" /> On the fourth anniversary of John Paul II's death, 2 April 2009, Cardinal Dziwisz, told reporters of a presumed miracle that had recently occurred at the former pope's tomb in St. Peter's Basilica.<ref name="Miracle-americancatholic" /><ref name="ncregister" /><ref name="Catholic" /> A nine-year-old Polish boy from [[Gdańsk]], who was suffering from kidney cancer and was completely unable to walk, had been visiting the tomb with his parents. On leaving St. Peter's Basilica, the boy told them, "I want to walk," and began walking normally.<ref name="ncregister" /><ref name="Catholic" /><ref name="Miracle-catholicnews" /> On 16 November 2009, a panel of reviewers at the Congregation for the Causes of Saints voted unanimously that John Paul&nbsp;II had lived a life of heroic virtue.<ref name="abcNews" /><ref name="Catholic Culture" /> On 19 December 2009, Pope Benedict XVI signed the first of two decrees needed for beatification and proclaimed John Paul II "Venerable", asserting that he had lived a heroic, virtuous life.<ref name="abcNews" /><ref name="Catholic Culture" /> The second vote and the second signed decree certifying the authenticity of the first miracle, [[Beatification and canonisation of Pope John Paul II|the curing of Sister Marie Simon-Pierre]], a French nun, from Parkinson's disease. Once the second decree is signed, the ''position'' (the report on the cause, with documentation about his life and writings and with information on the cause) is complete.<ref name="Catholic Culture" /> He can then be beatified.<ref name="abcNews" /><ref name="Catholic Culture" /> Some speculated that he would be beatified sometime during (or soon after) the month of the 32nd anniversary of his 1978 election, in October 2010. As Monsignor Oder said, this course would have been possible if the second decree were signed in time by Benedict XVI, stating that a posthumous miracle directly attributable to his intercession had occurred, completing the positio.

The Vatican announced on 14 January 2011 that Pope Benedict XVI had confirmed the miracle involving Sister Marie Simon-Pierre and that John Paul II was to be beatified on 1 May, the Feast of Divine Mercy.<ref name="BBC-beatify" /> 1 May is commemorated in former communist countries, such as Poland, and some Western European countries as May Day, and John Paul&nbsp;II was well known for his contributions to communism's relatively peaceful demise.<ref name="Bottum" /><ref name="CBCNews" /> In March 2011 the Polish mint issued a gold 1,000 [[Polish złoty]] coin (equivalent to US$350), with the Pope's image to commemorate his beatification.<ref name="yahoo" />

On 29 April 2011, John Paul&nbsp;II's coffin was disinterred from the grotto beneath St. Peter's Basilica ahead of his beatification, as tens of thousands of people arrived in Rome for one of the biggest events since his funeral.<ref name="Pope John Paul II's body exhumed ahead of beatification" /><ref>{{Cite news|last=Willey|first=David|date=1 May 2011|title=Celebration as John Paul beatified|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-13254148|access-date=11 May 2020}}</ref> John Paul II's remains, which were not exposed, were placed in front of the Basilica's main altar, where believers could pay their respect before and after the beatification mass in St. Peter's Square on 1 May 2011. On 3 May 2011 his remains were interred in the marble altar in Pier Paolo Cristofari Chapel of [[St. Sebastian]], where [[Pope Innocent XI]] was buried. This more prominent location, next to the Chapel of the Pietà, the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament, and statues of Popes Pius XI and Pius XII was intended to allow more pilgrims to view his memorial. John Paul II's body is located near the bodies of [[Pope Pius X]] and [[Pope John XXIII]], whose bodies were reinterred in the Basilica after their own canonizations and together are three of the four popes canonized in the last century. The only pope who was not exhumed and reinterred after becoming a saint in the last century was [[Pope Paul VI]], who remains buried in the papal grottos.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Visiting the Tomb of John Paul II in St Peter´s Basilica in the Vatican|url=https://www.vaticancityguide.org/visit-tomb-john-paul/|date=23 August 2013|website=Vatican City Travel Guide|language=en-US|access-date=11 May 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Pope Innocent XI's remains make way for John Paul II|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope-innocent-xis-remains-make-way-for-john-paul-ii|last=Kerr|first=David|website=Catholic News Agency|language=en|access-date=11 May 2020}}</ref>

In July 2012, a [[Colombia]]n man, Marco Fidel Rojas, the former mayor of [[Huila, Colombia]], testified that he was "miraculously cured" of [[Parkinson's disease]] after a trip to Rome where he met John Paul II and prayed with him.

=== Canonisation ===

[[File:Canonization 2014- The Canonization of Saint John XXIII and Saint John Paul II (14036819834).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|The canonisation of John Paul II and John XXIII]]

To be eligible for canonisation (being declared a saint) by the Catholic Church, two miracles must be attributed to a candidate.

The first miracle attributed to John Paul was the above mentioned healing of a man's Parkinson's disease, which was recognised during the beatification process. According to an article on the Catholic News Service (CNS) dated 23 April 2013, a Vatican commission of doctors concluded that a healing had no natural (medical) explanation, which is the first requirement for a claimed miracle to be officially documented.
<ref>The article by Cindy Wooden cited news reports from Italian news media agencies, and included remarks by the Pope's longtime aide, [[Kraków]]'s Cardinal [[Stanislaw Dziwisz]], and Vatican spokesman Jesuit Father [[Federico Lombardi]], S.J.</ref><ref name="Agence France-Presse" /><ref name="ANSA">{{cite news | first = Christopher | last = Livesay | title = John Paul set for sainthood after second miracle okayed | date = 2 July 2013 | publisher = www.ansa.it | url = http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/rubriche/english/2013/07/02/-ANSA-John-Paul-set-sainthood-second-miracle-okayed_8965021.html | work = ANSA (Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata) | access-date = 2 July 2013}}</ref>

The canonisation Mass for Blessed Popes John Paul II and John XXIII, was celebrated by Pope Francis (with Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI), on 27 April 2014 in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican (John Paul II had died on [[vigil]] of Divine Mercy Sunday in 2005). About 150 cardinals and 700 bishops concelebrated the Mass, and at least 500,000 people attended the Mass, with an estimated 300,000 others watching from video screens placed around Rome.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Los Angeles Times|url=http://www.latimes.com/world/worldnow/la-fg-wn-pope-francis-canonization-vatican-20140427-story.html |first1=Patrick J. |last1= McDonnell |first2=Tom |last2=Kington |date=27 April 2014|location=Los Angeles, CA |title=Canonization of predecessors provides another boost for Pope Francis|quote=An estimated 800,000 people descended on Rome for the dual canonisation, a Vatican spokesman said.

===Beatification of the Pope's parents===

On 10 October 2019, the [[Archdiocese of Krakow]] and the Polish Bishops' Conference approved ''nihil obstat'' the opening of the beatification cause of the parents of its patron saint John Paul II, Karol Wojtyła Sr. and Emilia Kaczorowska. It gained approval from the [[Holy See]] to open the diocesan phase of the cause on 7 May 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|title=St. John Paul II's parents' sainthood cause has officially opened|url=https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/st-john-paul-iis-parents-sainthood-cause-has-officially-opened-69386|access-date=22 November 2020|website=Catholic News Agency|language=en}}</ref>

== Criticism and controversy ==
{{Main|1=Criticism of Pope John Paul II|2=Criticism of the Catholic Church}}
John Paul II was widely criticised for a variety of his views. He was a target of criticism from progressives for his opposition to the [[ordination of women]] and use of [[contraception]],<ref name="A&E" /><ref name="Condom" /> and from [[Traditional Catholics]] for his support for the Second Vatican Council and its reform of the [[Mass (liturgy)|liturgy]]. John Paul II's response to [[Catholic sex abuse cases|child sexual abuse]] within the Church has also come under heavy censure.

=== Sex abuse scandals ===
{{Main|Catholic sex abuse cases}}
John Paul II was criticised by representatives of the victims of clergy sexual abuse<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scpr.org/news/2014/04/24/43763/some-victims-of-catholic-church-sex-abuse-oppose-p/|title=Clergy sex abuse victims decry sainthood for Pope John Paul II|first=Southern California Public|last=Radio|date=24 April 2014|work=scpr.org}}</ref> for failing to respond quickly enough to the [[Catholic sex abuse cases|Catholic sex abuse crisis]]. In his response, he stated that "there is no place in the priesthood and religious life for those who would harm the young."<ref name="Walsh" /> The Church instituted reforms to prevent future abuse by requiring [[background check]]s for Church employees<ref name="charteryouth" /> and, because a significant majority of victims were boys, disallowing ordination of men with "deep-seated homosexual tendencies".<ref name="vatdocord" /><ref name="sexabusereport" /> They now require dioceses faced with an allegation to alert the authorities, conduct an investigation and remove the accused from duty.<ref name="charteryouth" /><ref>{{cite news |title=Scandals in the church: The Bishops' Decisions; The Bishops' Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People |work=The New York Times |date=15 June 2002 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/15/us/scandals-church-bishops-decisions-bishops-charter-for-protection-children-young.html |access-date=22 October 2014}}</ref> In 2008, the Church asserted that the scandal was a very serious problem and estimated that it was "probably caused by 'no more than 1 per cent' " (or 5,000) of the over 500,000 Catholic priests worldwide.<ref name="sexabuse" /><ref name="JohnJay" />

In April 2002, John Paul II, despite being frail from Parkinson's disease, summoned all the American cardinals to the Vatican to discuss possible solutions to the issue of sexual abuse in the American Church. He asked them to "diligently investigate accusations". John Paul II suggested that American bishops be more open and transparent in dealing with such scandals and emphasised the role of seminary training to prevent sexual deviance among future priests. In what ''[[The New York Times]]'' called "unusually direct language", John Paul condemned the arrogance of priests that led to the scandals:

<blockquote>Priests and candidates for the priesthood often live at a level both materially and educationally superior to that of their families and the members of their own age group. It is therefore very easy for them to succumb to the temptation of thinking of themselves as better than others. When this happens, the ideal of priestly service and self-giving dedication can fade, leaving the priest dissatisfied and disheartened.<ref>{{cite news |author=Melinda Henneberger |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2002-04-21/news/0204200465_1_confutes-american-cardinals-mandatory-celibacy |title=Pope Takes on Scandals |work=Sun Sentinel |date=21 April 2002 |access-date=9 November 2012 |archive-date=25 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525055205/http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2002-04-21/news/0204200465_1_confutes-american-cardinals-mandatory-celibacy |url-status=dead }}</ref></blockquote>

The pope read a statement intended for the American cardinals, calling the sex abuse "an appalling sin" and said the priesthood had no room for such men.<ref name="Shame" />

In 2002, Archbishop [[Juliusz Paetz]], the Catholic Archbishop of [[Poznań]], was accused of molesting seminarians.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1837840.stm |title=Europe &#124; Polish archbishop 'molested students' |work=BBC News |date=23 February 2002 |access-date=17 February 2013}}</ref> John Paul II accepted his resignation, and placed sanctions on him, prohibiting Paetz from exercising his ministry as bishop.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.fakt.pl/Watykan-nie-zrehabilitowalismy-Paetza,artykuly,75072,1.html |title=Watykan: Nie zrehabilitowaliśmy Paetza |language=pl |trans-title=Vatican: no rehabilitation for Paetz |work=Fakt |date=19 June 2010 |access-date=9 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209162445/http://www.fakt.pl/Watykan-nie-zrehabilitowalismy-Paetza%2Cartykuly%2C75072%2C1.html |archive-date=9 February 2012 }}</ref> It was reported that these restrictions were lifted, though Vatican spokesperson Federico Lombardi strenuously denied this saying "his rehabilitation was without foundation".

In 2003, John Paul&nbsp;II reiterated that "there is no place in the priesthood and religious life for those who would harm the young."<ref name="Walsh" /> In April 2003, a three-day conference was held, titled "Abuse of Children and Young People by Catholic Priests and Religious", where eight non-Catholic psychiatric experts were invited to speak to near all Vatican dicasteries' representatives. The panel of experts overwhelmingly opposed implementation of policies of "zero-tolerance" such as was proposed by the US Conference of Catholic Bishops. One expert called such policies a "case of overkill" since they do not permit flexibility to allow for differences among individual cases.<ref name="VaticanStudy" />

In 2004, John Paul&nbsp;II recalled [[Bernard Francis Law]] to be Archpriest of the Papal Basilica of Saint Mary Major in Rome. Law had previously resigned as [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston|archbishop of Boston]] in 2002 in response to the [[Catholic Church sexual abuse cases]] after Church documents were revealed that suggested he had covered up sexual abuse committed by priests in his archdiocese.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/globe/spotlight/abuse/extras/law_timeline.htm |title=Abuse in the Catholic Church / Cardinal Law and the laity |work=The Boston Globe |year= 2004 |issn=0743-1791 |access-date=24 January 2012}}</ref> Law resigned from this position in November 2011.<ref name="Shame" />

John Paul&nbsp;II was a firm supporter of the [[Legion of Christ]], and in 1998 discontinued investigations into [[Sexual scandal of Father Marcial Maciel|sexual misconduct by its leader Marcial Maciel]], who in 2005 resigned his leadership and was later requested by the Vatican to withdraw from his ministry. However, Maciel's trial began in 2004 during the pontificate of John Paul II, but the Pope died before it ended and the conclusions were known.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kosciol.wiara.pl/doc/1974132.Co-Jan-Pawel-II-wiedzial-o-ks-Macielu|title=Co Jan Paweł II wiedział o ks.

On 10 November 2020, the Vatican published a report which found that John Paul II learned of allegations of sexual impropriety against former cardinal [[Theodore McCarrick]], who at the time was serving as Archbishop of Newark, through a 1999 letter from Cardinal [[John O'Connor (cardinal)|John O'Connor]] warning him that appointing McCarrick to be Archbishop of Washington D.C., a position which had recently been opened, would be a mistake. John Paul II ordered an investigation, which stalled when three of the four bishops tasked with investigating claims allegedly brought back "inaccurate or incomplete information." John Paul II planned on not giving McCarrick the appointment anyway, but relented and gave him the appointment after McCarrick wrote a letter of denial. He created McCarrick a cardinal in 2001. McCarrick would eventually be laicized after allegations surfaced that he abused minors.<ref name=johnpaulknowledge>{{cite news|title=Vatican admits Pope John Paul II was warned about abusive archbishop Theodore McCarrick, while clearing Francis|publisher=CNN|date=10 November 2020}}</ref><ref name="AP111020">{{cite web |url=https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/local/dc/findings-in-vatican-report-into-ex-cardinal-mccarrick/65-f3a47d57-95f4-4368-9945-a7ac909c5a02 |title=Key findings in Vatican report into ex-Cardinal McCarrick |date=10 November 2020 |publisher=Associated Press |access-date=10 November 2020}}</ref> [[George Weigel]], a biographer of John Paul II, defended the pope's actions as follows: "Theodore McCarrick fooled a lot of people ... and he deceived John Paul II in a way that is laid out in almost biblical fashion in [the Vatican's] report."<ref>{{cite news |last=Keane|first=James T.|date=10 November 2020|title=The McCarrick Report and Pope John Paul II: Confronting a saint's tarnished legacy|url=https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2020/11/10/mccarrick-report-saint-john-paul-ii-sex-abuse-legacy|work=[[America (magazine)|America]]|access-date=11 November 2011}}</ref>

=== Opus Dei controversies ===
{{Main|Controversies about Opus Dei}}
John Paul II was criticised for his support of the [[Opus Dei]] prelature and the 2002 canonisation of its founder, [[Josemaría Escrivá]], whom he called "the saint of ordinary life".<ref name="Opus2" /><ref name="Saints2" /> Other movements and religious organisations of the Church went decidedly under his wing [[Legion of Christ]], the [[Neocatechumenal Way]], [[Schoenstatt Movement|Schoenstatt]], the [[Charismatic Movement|charismatic movement]], etc. And he was accused repeatedly of taking a soft hand with them, especially in the case of [[Marcial Maciel]], founder of the Legion of Christ.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pepe-rodriguez.com/Sexo_clero/Casos/Sexo_clero_M_Maciel_Leg_pedof_denuncia_Papa.htm |title=Text of the accusation letter directed to John Paul II |language=es |publisher=Pepe-rodriguez.com |access-date=17 February 2013}}</ref>

=== Banco Ambrosiano scandal ===
{{Main|Banco Ambrosiano}}
John Paul II was alleged to have links with [[Banco Ambrosiano]], an Italian bank that collapsed in 1982.<ref name="NYTimes" /> At the centre of the bank's failure was its chairman, [[Roberto Calvi]], and his membership in the illegal [[Masonic Lodge]] [[Propaganda Due]] (aka P2). The Vatican Bank was Banco Ambrosiano's main shareholder, and the death of [[Pope John Paul I|John Paul I]] in 1978 is rumoured to be linked to the Ambrosiano scandal.<ref name="Salinger2005" />

Calvi, often referred to as "God's Banker", was also involved with the Vatican Bank, [[Istituto per le Opere di Religione]], and was close to Bishop [[Paul Marcinkus]], the bank's chairman. Ambrosiano also provided funds for political parties in Italy, and for both the [[Somoza]] dictatorship in Nicaragua and its Sandinista opposition. It has been widely alleged that the Vatican Bank provided money for [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] in Poland.<ref name="NYTimes" /><ref name="Salinger2005" />

Calvi used his complex network of overseas banks and companies to move money out of Italy, to inflate share prices, and to arrange massive unsecured loans. In 1978, the [[Banca d'Italia|Bank of Italy]] produced a report on Ambrosiano that predicted future disaster.<ref name="Salinger2005" /> On 5 June 1982, two weeks before the collapse of Banco Ambrosiano, Calvi had written a letter of warning to John Paul II, stating that such a forthcoming event would "provoke a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions in which the Church will suffer the gravest damage".<ref name="TimesOnline" /> On 18 June 1982 Calvi's body was found hanging from scaffolding beneath [[Blackfriars Bridge]] in the financial district of London. Calvi's clothing was stuffed with bricks, and contained cash valued at US$14,000, in three different currencies.<ref name="GodsBanker" />

=== Problems with traditionalists ===
In addition to all the criticism from those demanding modernisation, some [[Traditionalist Catholicism|Traditionalist Catholics]] denounced him as well. These issues included demanding a return to the [[Tridentine Mass]]<ref name="HughHewitt" /> and repudiation of the reforms instituted after the Second Vatican Council, such as the use of the vernacular language in the formerly Latin [[Roman Rite]] Mass, [[ecumenism]], and the principle of [[Freedom of religion|religious liberty]].<ref>e.g. Marcel Lefebvre, ''An Open Letter to Confused Catholics'' (Herefordshire: Gracewing Publishing, 1986). {{ISBN|9780852440476}}</ref> In 1988, the controversial traditionalist Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, founder of the Society of St. Pius X (1970), was [[excommunication|excommunicated]] under John Paul II because of the unapproved ordination of four bishops, which Cardinal Ratzinger called a "schismatic act".<ref>A discussion of the crucial work of Ratzinger (later pope) to attempt reconciliation between Lefebvre and the Holy See, ''vide'' John Thavis, ''The Vatican Diaries: A Behind-the-Scenes Look at the Power, Personalities, and Politics at the Heart of the Catholic Church'' (London: Penguin, 2014), 147–49. {{ISBN|9780143124535}}</ref>

The [[World Day of Prayer for Peace]],<ref name="Assisi4" /> with a meeting in Assisi, Italy, in 1986, in which the pope prayed only with the Christians,<ref name="SanRufino" /> was criticised for giving the impression that [[syncretism]] and [[indifferentism]] <!-- Don't change it back to "syncretism and/or indifferentism" as "and" gives the same ambiguity, e.g., that the event embraced or syncretism or indifferentism or both; see [[MOS#And/or]] --> were openly embraced by the Papal [[Magisterium]]. When a second 'Day of Prayer for Peace in the World'<ref name="DayOfPrayer" /> was held, in 2002, it was condemned as confusing the laity and compromising to false religions. Likewise criticised was his kissing<ref name="Qu'ran" /> of the Qur'an in Damascus, Syria, on one of his travels on 6 May 2001. His call for religious freedom was not always supported; bishops like [[Antônio de Castro Mayer]] promoted [[Religious toleration|religious tolerance]], but at the same time rejected the Vatican II principle of religious liberty as being [[Liberalism|liberalist]] and already condemned by Pope Pius IX in his ''[[Syllabus of Errors|Syllabus errorum]]'' (1864) and at the [[First Vatican Council]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu8E8GNnTIc |title=Jan Paweł II Live at Vatican 1999 |publisher=youtube.com |date=28 August 2011 |access-date=17 February 2013}}</ref>

=== Religion and AIDS ===
{{Main|Catholic Church and HIV/AIDS}}
John Paul II's continued the tradition of advocating for the "Culture of life" and, in solidarity with [[Pope Paul VI]]'s [[Humanae Vitae]] rejected artificial birth control, even in the use of condoms to prevent the spread of AIDS.<ref name="Condom" /> Critics have said that large families are caused by lack of contraception and exacerbate [[Third World]] poverty and problems such as street children in South America. John Paul II argued that the proper way to prevent the spread of AIDS was not condoms, but rather, "correct practice of sexuality, which presupposes chastity and fidelity."<ref name="Condom" /> The focus of John Paul II's point is that the need for artificial birth control is itself artificial, and that principle of respecting the sacredness of life ought not be rend asunder in order to achieve the good of preventing AIDS.

=== Social programmes ===
There was strong criticism of the pope for the controversy surrounding the alleged use of charitable social programmes as a means of converting people in the Third World to Catholicism.<ref name="AsiaNews2" /><ref name="IndiaStar" /> The pope created an uproar in the [[Indian sub continent|Indian subcontinent]] when he suggested that a great harvest of faith would be witnessed on the subcontinent in the third Christian millennium.<ref name="NCR2" />

=== Dictatorships in Latin America ===
John Paul visited General [[Augusto Pinochet]], [[Chile]]'s military ruler. According to the [[United Press International]], "Pope John Paul II preached the need for peaceful change and greater participation up and down Chile...but stayed away from direct confrontation with Gen. Augusto Pinochet's military regime...disappointing Pinochet's opponents who had hoped the pope would publicly condemn the regime and bless their campaign for a return to democracy."<ref>{{cite news |title=Pope avoids confrontation with Pinochet |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/04/11/Pope-avoids-confrontation-with-Pinochet/8894545112000/ |work=United Press International |date=11 April 1987}}</ref>

John Paul endorsed [[Pio Laghi|Pío Cardinal Laghi]], who critics say supported the "[[Dirty War]]" in Argentina and was on friendly terms with the Argentine generals of the [[National Reorganization Process|military dictatorship]], playing regular tennis matches with Navy's representative in the junta, Admiral [[Emilio Eduardo Massera]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Argentine military dictator confirms Catholic Church hierarchy was well aware of the "disappeared" |url=https://en.mercopress.com/2012/07/24/argentine-military-dictator-confirms-catholic-church-hierarchy-was-well-aware-of-the-disappeared |work=MercoPress |date=24 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Vatican says its ex-envoy is innocent |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1997/05/23/vatican-says-its-ex-envoy-is-innocent/dfe0ea8f-ee44-4999-85d2-e96e0aa9c694/ |work=The Washington Post |date=23 May 1997}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Former Argentinian dictator says he told Catholic Church of disappeared |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/former-argentinian-dictator-says-he-told-catholic-church-of-disappeared-1.542154 |work=The Irish Times |date=24 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Pio Laghi, Papal Envoy, Dies at 86 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/13/world/europe/13laghi.html |work=The New York Times |date=13 January 2009}}</ref>

=== Ian Paisley ===
In 1988, when John Paul II was delivering a speech to the European Parliament, [[Ian Paisley]], the leader of the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] and [[Moderator of the General Assembly|Moderator]] of the [[Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster]], shouted "I denounce you as the [[Antichrist]]!"<ref name="Paisley makes point">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-29179048 |title=Ian Paisley dies: How Paisley made his point |location=Belfast |publisher=[[BBC Northern Ireland]] |date=1988 |access-date=12 September 2014 }}</ref><ref name=LATimes>{{cite news |title=Ian Paisley and politics of peace|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/mar/24/opinion/la-ed-paisley24-2010mar24 |access-date=16 February 2012 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=24 March 2010}} from 1:45&nbsp;m into video</ref> and held up a red banner reading "Pope John Paul II ANTICHRIST". [[Otto von Habsburg]] (the last [[List of heirs to the Austrian throne|Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary]]), an [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] for Germany, snatched Paisley's banner, tore it up and, along with other MEPs, helped eject him from the chamber.<ref name="Paisley makes point" /><ref name="BBCIreland" /><ref name="Paisley" /><ref name="NYT5" /><ref name="Cloud" /> The pope continued with his address after Paisley had been ejected.<ref name="BBCIreland" /><ref name="MacDonald" /><ref name="Angelique" />

=== Međugorje apparitions ===
{{see also|Our Lady of Međugorje}}

A number of quotes about the [[Catholic Church response to the Medjugorje apparitions|apparitions of Međugorje]], in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], have been attributed to John Paul II.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medjugorje.org/pope.htm |title=Quotes From Pope John Paul II On Međugorje |publisher=Medjugorje.org |access-date=4 August 2012}}</ref> In 1998, when a certain German gathered various statements that were supposedly made by the pope and Cardinal Ratzinger, and then forwarded them to the Vatican in the form of a memorandum, Ratzinger responded in writing on 22 July 1998: "The only thing I can say regarding statements on [[Medjugorje|Međugorje]] ascribed to the Holy Father and myself is that they are complete invention." (''frei erfunden'').{{sfn|Kutleša|2001|p=283}}{{sfn|Nacional}} Similar claims were also rebuked by the Vatican's Secretariate of State.{{sfn|Kutleša|2001|p=256}}

=== Beatification controversy===
Some Catholic [[Theology|theologians]] disagreed with the call for the beatification of John Paul&nbsp;II. Eleven dissident theologians, including [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] professor José María Castillo and Italian theologian [[Giovanni Franzoni]], said that his stance against contraception and the ordination of women as well as the Church scandals during his pontificate presented "facts which according to their consciences and convictions should be an obstacle to beatification".<ref>{{cite web |title=Dissident theologians participate in the canonization process of Pope John Paul II |url=https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/dissident_theologians_participate_in_the_canonization_process_of_pope_john_paul_ii |website=catholicnewsagency.com |publisher=CNA |access-date=4 March 2020}}</ref> Some traditionalist Catholics opposed his beatification and canonisation for his views on liturgy and participation in prayer with enemies of the Church, heretics and non-Christians.<ref>{{cite news |title=A Statement of Reservations Concerning the Impending Beatification of Pope John Paul II |date=21 March 2011 |author=Michael J.

After the 2020 report about the handling of the sexual misconduct complaints against Theodore McCarrick, some called for John Paul II's sainthood to be revoked.<ref>[https://www.wbur.org/cognoscenti/2020/11/12/pope-francis-theodore-mccarrick-clergy-sex-abuse-eileen-mcnamara 'The Halo Is Hopelessly Tarnished': Why The Sainthood Of John Paul II Should Be Rescinded]</ref>

Karol Wojtyła was a [[KS Cracovia (football)|Cracovia]] [[association football|football]] team supporter (club retired number 1 in his honour).<ref>{{cite news|title=Cracovia is about the people – John Paul II|url=https://en.cracovia.pl/football/club/historia/jan_pawel_ii|access-date=4 April 2019|publisher=en.cracovia.pl|date=9 September 2010}}</ref>
Having played the game himself as a goalkeeper, John Paul II was a fan of English [[association football|football]] team [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], where his compatriot [[Jerzy Dudek]] played in the same position.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pope supports Liverpool|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/funny_old_game/3242602.stm|access-date=16 March 2016|work=BBC Sport|date=27 November 2003}}</ref>

In 1973, while still the archbishop of Kraków, Karol Wojtyła befriended a Polish-born, later American [[philosopher]], [[Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka]]. The thirty-two-year friendship (and occasional academic collaboration) lasted until his death.<ref name="Stourton" /><ref name="Guardian-letters" /><ref name="Telegraph 2016" /> She served as his host when he visited New England in 1976 and photos show them together on skiing and camping trips.<ref name="Telegraph 2016" /> Letters that he wrote to her were part of a collection of documents sold by Tymieniecka's estate in 2008 to the [[National Library of Poland]].<ref name="Telegraph 2016" /> According to the BBC the library had initially kept the letters from public view, partly because of John Paul's path to sainthood, but a library official announced in February 2016 the letters would be made public.<ref name="Telegraph 2016" /><ref name="NYT-letters-show-deep">{{cite news|last1=Berendt|first1=Joanna|last2=Chan|first2=Sewell|title=Letters From Pope John Paul II Show Deep Friendship With Woman|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/16/world/europe/letters-from-pope-john-paul-ii-show-deep-friendship-with-woman.html|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=16 February 2016|date=15 February 2016}}</ref> In February 2016 the BBC documentary program ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' reported that John Paul II had apparently had a 'close relationship' with the Polish-born philosopher.<ref name="Telegraph 2016" /><ref name="Panarama">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b071flrn Panorama report: The Secret Letters of Pope John Paul II] by Ed Stourton, 15 February 2016</ref> The pair exchanged personal letters over 30 years, and Stourton believes that Tymieniecka had confessed her love for Wojtyła.<ref name="Stourton"/><ref name="Guardian2016">[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/15/pope-john-paul-ii-letters-reveal-32-year-relationship-with-woman Pope John Paul II letters reveal 32-year relationship with woman] by Stephanie Kirchgaessner, Rome, 15 February 2016</ref> The Vatican described the documentary as "more smoke than mirrors", and Tymieniecka denied being involved with John Paul II.<ref>[http://www.thenews.pl/1/10/Artykul/240672,Vatican-denies-JPII-letter-loveaffair-report Vatican dismisses JPII 'letter love-affair' probe:] 14 February 2016, The Vatican</ref><ref>[https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/pope-john-paul-ii-conducted-7366760 Pope John Paul II 'conducted secret romance with married woman' says new documentary] by John Kelly, Mirror.co.uk News</ref>

Writers [[Carl Bernstein]], the veteran investigative journalist of the [[Watergate scandal]], and Vatican expert Marco Politi, were the first journalists to talk to Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka in the 1990s about her importance in John Paul's life. They interviewed her and dedicated 20 pages to her in their 1996 book ''His Holiness''.<ref name="Stourton" /><ref name="Bernstein/Politi">[http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/02/15/did-pope-john-paul-ii-have-a-secret-lover.html Did Pope John Paul II Have a Secret Lover?] by Barbi Latzu Nadeau, 15 February 2016</ref><ref>''His Holiness: John Paul II & the History of Our Time''—Carl Bernstein, Marco Politi (1996)</ref> Bernstein and Politi even asked her if she had ever developed any romantic relationship with John Paul II, "however one-sided it might have been." She responded, "No, I never fell in love with the cardinal. How could I fall in love with a middle-aged clergyman? Besides, I'm a married woman."<ref name="Stourton" /><ref name="Bernstein/Politi" />
