'''Alain Tasso''' (born July 22, 1962 in [[Beirut]]) is a Lebanese-French [[poet]], [[Painting|painter]] and [[essayist]]. An [[Autodidacticism|autodidact]], his prolific intense literary work is largely acclaimed by critics.

== Biography ==
Tasso attended high school at the [[Grand Lycée Franco-Libanais de Beyrouth]], but refused to sit for his baccalaureate exam, and decided to study accounting instead. He remained in that field only for a few years.

Grandly interested in [[antiquities]], [[art objects]], [[classical music]], especially [[Baroque music|sacred baroque music]], Tasso, who had started playing the piano at five, opened in 1987 "L'insolite", an art gallery. He specialized in both [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Oriental art]], and began drawing [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] and [[calligraphy]]. Two years later, as the violent conflicts of the [[Lebanese civil war]] ravaged the country, he was forced to shut down gallery. He worked between 1992 and 2000 as a freelancer for numerous French and Arabic magazines and daily papers in Beirut, such as [[L'Orient Le Jour]], and published in 1993 a youth poem collection featuring a preface written by the Lebanese poet [[Said Akl]]. In 1996, Tasso was promoted [[Chevalier de l'Ordre Patriarcal de la Sainte Croix de Jérusalem]], an eminent Oriental Catholic distinction. In 1998, he participated in a collective exhibition for the fiftieth anniversary of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], and as of following year, started teaching the postgraduate "[[Æsthetics]]" course at the [[Institut d'études scéniques, audiovisuelles et cinématographiques]] (IESAV - The Scenic, Audiovisual and Cinematographic Institute) of the [[Saint Joseph University]] in Beirut. Later on, he was asked to lecture in several departments of the Faculty of Humanities at the same university ([[intercultural competence]], [[art history]], [[fine arts]], [[cultural communication]]. Since 1995, he participated in numerous painting exhibitions, and his art evolved from an abstract [[Arabic calligraphy]] to a [[Sufi]] style, all the way to a dense and monochromatic black vision.

In 2001, Tasso founded along with the Lebanese critic [[Joseph Tarrab]] "Péristyles", an artistic and literary publishing outlet at the [[Saint Joseph University]]. In 2003, a study on the "Neige écarlate" ranked him with poets [[Yves Bonnefoy]] and [[Paul Celan]]. [[Yves Bonnefoy|Bonnefoy]] wrote him after reading one of his publications: "Thank you for this beautiful book. Your ''Intailles''<ref>''Intailles, Te deum pour un requiem du temps'', a publication by Alain Tasso in 2004, illustrated with his art, in the collection Les blés d'or</ref> makes us think…".

In 2005 he was promoted to [[Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres]] by the French Government and featured in 2008 in the anthology ''Poésies de langue française'' published by Seghers Editions.

Alain Tasso is the author of more than ten [[poetry|poem collections]] published on fine paper, and illustrated by Tasso himself or with paintings for [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Van der Weyden]] (''Retables pour des murs en papier'', 2001), and [[Egon Schiele]] (''Sang des neiges et autres poèmes'', 2002). He is also the author of several essays on "[[ethics]]" as well as on "[[image and power]]" in a dehumanized contemporary society (''Les fins de l'image'', 2009 ; ''Encore ce peu d'images malgré tout'', 2011).

His poetry, [[mysticism|mystic]] at its beginnings (''Les lampes d'écume'', 1999), started out as [[expressionism]] (''Fragments chaotiques'', 2000; ''Retables pour des murs en papier'', 2001; ''Sang des neiges et autres poèmes'', 2002; ''Intailles, Te Deum pour un requiem du temps'', 2004). Later it became denser, and developed a very pure and literary style which has made Tasso a [[Poet of the Presence]] and a much noticed figure of the French poetry (''De neige et de pierres'', ''Poèmes pour l'improbable'', 2005; ''Assomption d'une autre saison'', 2005; ''Paysages de flot précédé de Sommeil des Ancolies'', 2009; ''Brisants comme dictame d'un monde trépassé'', 2010).

In October 2010, the publishing firm "Les éditions de la Revue Phénicienne" released an [[anthology]] entitled ''Alain Tasso'', preceded by eleven studies and critical texts.<ref>Check the French review of [[L'Orient-Le Jour]], http://cllf.wordpress.com/2010/10/23/alain-tasso-lu-vu-et-explique-par-onze-plumes-critiques/ and the one of NOW Lebanon, an Arabic-English website that seldom published in French, http://www.nowlebanon.com/arabic/NewsArchiveDetails.aspx?ID=212220/{{Dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

He started teaching in 2011 at the [[Lebanese Academy of Fine Arts]] (Académie libanaise des Beaux-Arts, ALBA). He is also the author of numerous [[artist books]].{{cn|date=November 2020}}

== Talking about the [[Arab Spring]] ==
In the frame of the [[European Parliament]] in [[Brussels]], Alex Taylor hosted Alain Tasso as the special guest of [[Euronews]] "I-Talk" program. Chosen from the [[Arab World]], Tasso gave an interview on the [[Arab Spring]]. Recorded in French, and broadcast from July 14 to July 21, 2011 on Euronews international channels, the talk was also dubbed and translated in the ten languages of the channel, namely French, English, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Turkish, Russian, Arabic and Persian.<ref>{{cite news|last=Taylor |first=Alex |title=Alain Tasso on the Arab Spring |url=http://www.euronews.net/2011/07/14/alain-tasso-on-the-arab-spring/ |accessdate=28 November 2012 |newspaper=Euronews |date=14 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105061342/http://www.euronews.net/2011/07/14/alain-tasso-on-the-arab-spring/ |archivedate=5 November 2011 }}</ref>
