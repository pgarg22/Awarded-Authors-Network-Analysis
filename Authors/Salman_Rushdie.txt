In 1999, Rushdie had an operation to correct [[ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]], a problem with the levator palpebrae superioris muscle that causes a drooping of the upper eyelid.

===Literary works===
Rushdie's first novel, ''[[Grimus]]'' (1975), a part-science fiction tale, was generally ignored by the public and literary critics. His next novel, ''[[Midnight's Children]]'' (1981), catapulted him to literary notability. This work won the 1981 [[Man Booker Prize|Booker Prize]] and, in 1993 and 2008, was awarded the Best of the Bookers as the best novel to have received the prize during its first 25 and 40 years.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.themanbookerprize.com/news/stories/1099 |title = Readers across the world agree that Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children is the Best of the Booker. |year = 2008 |access-date = 10 July 2008 |publisher = Man Booker Prizes |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081011052625/http://www.themanbookerprize.com/news/stories/1099 |archive-date = 11 October 2008 |df = dmy-all}}</ref> ''Midnight's Children'' follows the life of a child, born at the stroke of midnight as India gained its independence, who is endowed with special powers and a connection to other children born at the dawn of a new and tumultuous age in the history of the Indian sub-continent and [[History of the Republic of India|the birth of the modern nation of India]]. The character of Saleem Sinai has been compared to Rushdie.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Review/One_more_bouquet_for_Saleem_Sinai/articleshow/3254751.cms|title=One more bouquet for Saleem Sinai|first=Nina|last=Martyris|newspaper=The Times of India|date=20 July 2008|quote=Saleem is not Salman (although he marries a Padma) and Saleem's grandfather Dr Aadam Aziz is not him either, but there is a touching prescience at work here. In the opening pages of Midnight's Children, Dr Aziz while bending down on his prayer mat, bumps his nose on a hard tussock of earth. His nose bleeds and his eyes water and he decides then and there that never again will he bow before God or man. "This decision, however, made a hole in him, a vacancy in a vital inner chamber, leaving him vulnerable to women and history." Battered by a fatwa and one femme fatale too many, Salman would have some understanding of this.}}</ref> However, the author has refuted the idea of having written any of his characters as autobiographical, stating, "People assume that because certain things in the character are drawn from your own experience, it just becomes you. In that sense, I’ve never felt that I’ve written an autobiographical character."<ref name=Meer>{{cite journal|last1=Meer|first1=Ameena|title=Interview: Salman Rushdie|journal=[[Bomb (magazine)|Bomb]]|date=1989|volume=27|issue=Spring|url=http://bombmagazine.org/article/1199/|access-date=22 March 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402111324/http://bombmagazine.org/article/1199/|archive-date=2 April 2015}}</ref>

After ''Midnight's Children'', Rushdie wrote ''[[Shame (Rushdie novel)|Shame]]'' (1983), in which he depicts the political turmoil in [[Pakistan]], basing his characters on [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] and General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]]. ''Shame'' won France's ''[[Prix du Meilleur Livre Étranger]]'' (Best Foreign Book) and was a close runner-up for the Booker Prize. Both these works of [[postcolonial literature]] are characterised by a style of [[magic realism]] and the immigrant outlook that Rushdie is very conscious of as a member of the [[Kashmiri diaspora]].

Rushdie wrote a non-fiction book about [[Nicaragua]] in 1987 called ''[[The Jaguar Smile]]''. This book has a political focus and is based on his first-hand experiences and research at the scene of [[Sandinista]] political experiments.

His most controversial work, ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'', was published in 1988 (see [[#Satanic Verses and the fatwā|section below]]). It was followed by ''[[Haroun and the Sea of Stories]]'' in 1990. Written in the shadow of the fatwa, it is about the dangers of story-telling and an allegorical defence of the power of stories over silence.<ref name="BritshC" />

In addition to books, Rushdie has published many short stories, including those collected in ''[[East, West]]'' (1994). ''[[The Moor's Last Sigh]]'', a family epic ranging over some 100 years of India's history was published in 1995. ''[[The Ground Beneath Her Feet]]'' (1999) is a remaking of the myth of [[Orpheus]] that presents an [[Alternate history|alternative history]] of modern rock music.<ref>[https://www.salmanrushdie.com/the-ground-beneath-her-feet/ "The Ground Beneath her Feet"] at Salman Rushdie.com.</ref> The [[The Ground Beneath Her Feet (song)|song of the same name]] by [[U2]] is one of many song lyrics included in the book; hence Rushdie is credited as the lyricist.

[[File:Salman-Rushdie-1.jpg|thumb|upright|Salman Rushdie presenting his book ''[[Shalimar the Clown]]'']]

Following the novel ''[[Fury (Rushdie novel)|Fury]]'', set mainly in New York and avoiding the previous sprawling narrative style that spans generations, periods and places, Rushdie's 2005 novel ''[[Shalimar the Clown]]'', a story about love and betrayal set in Kashmir and Los Angeles, was hailed as a return to form by a number of critics.<ref name="BritshC" />

In his 2002 non-fiction collection ''Step Across This Line'', he professes his admiration for the Italian writer [[Italo Calvino]] and the American writer [[Thomas Pynchon]], among others. His early influences included [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Mikhail Bulgakov]], [[Lewis Carroll]], [[Günter Grass]], and [[James Joyce]]. Rushdie was a personal friend of [[Angela Carter]]'s and praised her highly in the foreword of her collection ''Burning your Boats''.

2008 saw the publication of ''[[The Enchantress of Florence]]'', one of Rushdie's most challenging works that focuses on the past. It tells the story of a European's visit to [[Akbar]]’s court, and his revelation that he is a lost relative of the [[Mughal empire|Mughal]] emperor. The novel was praised in a review in ''[[The Guardian]]'' as a ″sumptuous mixture of history with fable″.<ref name="BritshC" />

His novel ''[[Luka and the Fire of Life]]'', a sequel to ''Haroun and the Sea of Stories'', was published in November 2010 to critical acclaim.<ref name="BritshC" /> Earlier that year, he announced that he was writing his memoirs,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/12/salman-rushdie-fatwa-memoir|title=Salman Rushdie at work on fatwa memoir|first=Benedicte|last=Page|newspaper=The Guardian|date= 12 October 2010|access-date= 14 September 2012}}</ref> entitled ''[[Joseph Anton: A Memoir]]'', which was published in September 2012.

In 2012, Salman Rushdie became one of the first major authors to embrace [[Booktrack]] (a company that synchronises ebooks with customised soundtracks), when he published his short story "[[In the South (Short Story)|In the South]]" on the platform.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://booktrack.serveronline.net/blog/?p=164|title=Salman Rushdie Collaborates With Booktrack and the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, Booktrack Launches A New E-reader Platform|publisher=Booktrack|access-date=2 July 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404115658/http://booktrack.serveronline.net/blog/?p=164|archive-date=4 April 2014}}</ref>

2015 saw the publication of Rushdie's novel ''[[Two Years Eight Months and Twenty-Eight Nights]]'', a shift back to his old beloved technique of magic realism. This novel is designed in the structure of a Chinese mystery box with different layers. Based on the central conflict of scholar [[Ibn Rushd]], (from whom Rushdie's family name derives), Rushdie goes on to explore several themes of [[transnationalism]] and [[cosmopolitanism]] by depicting a war of the universe which a supernatural world of [[jinns]] also accompanies.

In 2017, ''[[The Golden House (novel)|The Golden House]]'', a satirical novel set in contemporary America, was published.

2019 saw the publication of Rushdie's fourteenth novel ''[[Quichotte (novel)|Quichotte]]'', inspired by [[Miguel de Cervantes]] classic novel ''[[Don Quixote]]''.

===Critical reception===
Rushdie has had a string of commercially successful and critically acclaimed novels. 
His works have been shortlisted for the [[Booker Prize]] five times, in 1981 for [[Midnight's Children|''Midnight's Children'']], 1983 for [[Shame (Rushdie novel)|''Shame'']], 1988 for [[The Satanic Verses|''The Satanic Verses'']], 1995 for [[The Moor's Last Sigh|''The Moor's Last Sigh'']], and in 2019 for [[Quichotte (novel)|''Quichotte'']].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.booksandpublishing.com.au/articles/2019/09/04/138599/booker-prize-2019-shortlist-announced/|title=Booker Prize 2019 shortlist announced|date=4 September 2019|website=Books+Publishing|language=en-AU|access-date=6 September 2019}}</ref> In 1981, he was awarded the prize.<ref name="Children">{{cite news|last1=Jordison|first1=Sam|title=Midnight's Children is the right winner|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/jul/10/bestofbooker|work=The Guardian|date=10 July 2008}}</ref> His 2005 novel ''[[Shalimar the Clown]]'' received the prestigious [[Hutch Crossword Book Award]], and, in the UK, was a finalist for the [[Whitbread Book Awards]].

=== Film and television ===
[[File:9.21.14WritersLifePanelByLuigiNovi18.jpg|thumb|Rushdie, right, with writers [[Catherine Lacey (author)|Catherine Lacey]] and [[Siri Hustvedt]] at the 2014 [[Brooklyn Book Festival]]]]Though he enjoys writing, Salman Rushdie says that he would have become an actor if his writing career had not been successful. Even from early childhood, he dreamed of appearing in Hollywood movies (which he later realised in his frequent cameo appearances).

Rushdie includes fictional television and movie characters in some of his writings. He had a [[cameo appearance]] in the film ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary (2001 film)|Bridget Jones's Diary]]'' based on the [[Bridget Jones's Diary (novel)|book of the same name]], which is itself full of literary in-jokes. On 12 May 2006, Rushdie was a guest host on ''[[The Charlie Rose Show]]'', where he interviewed [[Indo-Canadian]] filmmaker [[Deepa Mehta]], whose 2005 film, ''[[Water (2005 film)|Water]]'', faced violent protests. He appears in the role of [[Helen Hunt]]'s [[obstetrics and gynaecology|obstetrician-gynecologist]] in the film adaptation (Hunt's directorial debut) of [[Elinor Lipman]]'s novel ''[[Then She Found Me]]''. In September 2008, and again in March 2009, he appeared as a panellist on the HBO program ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]''. Rushdie has said that he was approached for a cameo in ''[[Talladega Nights]]'': "They had this idea, just one shot in which three very, very unlikely people were seen as [[NASCAR]] drivers. And I think they approached [[Julian Schnabel]], [[Lou Reed]], and me. We were all supposed to be wearing the uniforms and the helmet, walking in slow motion with the heat haze." In the end their schedules didn't allow for it.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Salman Rushdie|url=http://the-talks.com/interviews/salman-rushdie/|publisher=The Talks}}</ref>

In 2009, Rushdie signed a petition in support of film director [[Roman Polanski]], calling for his release after Polanski was arrested in Switzerland in relation to his [[Roman Polanski sexual abuse case|1977 charge]] for drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://laregledujeu.org/2009/11/10/479/signez-la-petition-pour-roman-polanski/ |title=Signez la pétition pour Roman Polanski ! |date=10 November 2009 |website=La Règle du jeu |language=fr |access-date=29 August 2021 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/AytVq |archive-date=29 August 2021}}</ref>

Rushdie collaborated on the screenplay for the cinematic adaptation of his novel ''Midnight's Children'' with director [[Deepa Mehta]].

Rushdie announced in June 2011 that he had written the first draft of a script for a new television series for the US cable network [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]], a project on which he will also serve as an executive producer. The new series, to be called ''The Next People'', will be, according to Rushdie, "a sort of paranoid science-fiction series, people disappearing and being replaced by other people." The idea of a television series was suggested by his US agents, said Rushdie, who felt that television would allow him more creative control than feature film. ''The Next People'' is being made by the British film production company [[Working Title]], the firm behind such projects as ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'' and ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Salman Rushdie says TV drama series have taken the place of novels|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/12/salman-rushdie-write-tv-drama|newspaper=The Guardian |date=12 June 2011|access-date=11 June 2011|last=Thorpe|first=Vanessa|location=London}}</ref>

In 2017, Rushdie appeared as himself in Episode 3 of Season 9 of ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hbo.com/curb-your-enthusiasm/season-9|title=Curb Your Enthusiasm - Season 9|website=HBO}}</ref> sharing scenes with [[Larry David]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0202970/|title=Larry David|website=IMDb}}</ref> to offer advice on how Larry should deal with the fatwa that has been ordered against him.

==''The Satanic Verses'' and the ''fatwā''{{anchor|Satanic Verses and the fatwā}}==
{{Further|The Satanic Verses controversy}}

The publication of ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'' in September 1988 caused immediate controversy in the [[Islamic world]] because of what was seen by some to be an irreverent depiction of [[Muhammad]]. The title refers to a disputed [[hadith|Muslim tradition]] that is related in the book. According to this tradition, Muhammad ([[Mahound]] in the book) added verses (''[[Ayah]]'') to the [[Qur'an]] accepting three goddesses who used to be worshipped in [[Mecca]] as divine beings. According to the legend, Muhammad later revoked the verses, saying [[the devil]] tempted him to utter these lines to appease the Meccans (hence the "Satanic" verses). However, the narrator reveals to the reader that these disputed verses were actually from the mouth of the [[Gabriel|Archangel Gabriel]]. The [[banned books|book was banned]] in many countries with large Muslim communities (13 in total: Iran, India, Bangladesh, Sudan, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Thailand, Tanzania, Indonesia, Singapore, Venezuela, and Pakistan).

In response to the protests, on 22 January 1989 Rushdie published a column in ''[[The Observer]]'' that called Muhammad "one of the great geniuses of world history," but noted that Islamic doctrine holds Muhammad to be human, and in no way perfect. He held that the novel is not "an anti-religious novel. It is, however, an attempt to write about migration, its stresses and transformations."<ref name=Observer>{{cite news|last1=Rushdie|first1=Salman|title=Choice between light and dark|work=[[The Observer]]|date=22 January 1989}}</ref>

On 14 February 1989—Valentine's Day, and also the day of his close friend [[Bruce Chatwin]]'s funeral—a ''[[fatwā]]'' ordering Rushdie's execution was proclaimed on Radio Tehran by [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Khomeini]], the [[Supreme leader of Iran]] at the time, calling the book "[[blasphemy|blasphemous]] against Islam". Chapter IV of the book depicts the character of an [[Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)|Imam]] in [[exile]] who returns to incite revolt from the people of his country with no regard for their safety. A bounty was offered for Rushdie's death,<ref name="independent.co.uk">{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/salman-rushdie-iranian-state-media-renew-fatwa-on-satanic-verses-author-with-600000-bounty-a6887141.html|title=Iranian state media has put a $600,000 bounty on Salman Rushdie's head|first=Samuel|last=Osborne|date=21 February 2016|website=The Independent|access-date=24 December 2018}}</ref> and he was thus forced to live under police protection for several years.<ref name="independent.co.uk"/> On 7 March 1989, the United Kingdom and [[Iran]] broke [[Iran&nbsp;– United Kingdom relations|diplomatic]] relations over the Rushdie controversy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/08/world/iran-breaks-off-relations-with-britian.html|title=Iran Breaks Off Relations With Britain|first1=Sheila|last1=Rule|first2=Special To the New York|last2=Times|newspaper=The New York Times|date=8 March 1989}}</ref>

When, on [[BBC Radio 4]], he was asked for a response to the threat, Rushdie said, "Frankly, I wish I had written a more critical book," and "I'm very sad that it should have happened. It's not true that this book is a blasphemy against Islam. I doubt very much that Khomeini or anyone else in Iran has read the book or more than selected extracts out of context."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/1989/feb/15/salmanrushdie|title=Rushdie in hiding after Ayatollah's death threat|first=Peter|last=Murtagh|date=15 February 1989|access-date=24 December 2018|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>  Later, he wrote that he was "proud, then and always", of that statement; while he did not feel his book was especially critical of Islam, "a religion whose leaders behaved in this way could probably use a little criticism."<ref>{{cite web|last=Rushdie|first=Salman|title=The Disappeared|date=9 September 2012|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/09/17/120917fa_fact_rushdie|publisher=The New Yorker (17 September 2012), p. 50|access-date=16 September 2012}}</ref>

Despite the danger posed by the fatwā, Rushdie made a public appearance at London's [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] on 11 August 1993 during a [[Zoo TV Tour|concert by U2]]. In 2010, U2 bassist [[Adam Clayton]] recalled that "[[lead vocalist]] Bono had been calling Salman Rushdie from the stage every night on the Zoo TV tour. When we played Wembley, Salman showed up in person and the stadium erupted. You [could] tell from [drummer] Larry Mullen, Jr.'s face that we weren't expecting it. Salman was a regular visitor after that. He had a backstage pass and he used it as often as possible.

A former bodyguard to Rushdie, Ron Evans, planned to publish a book recounting the behaviour of the author during the time he was in hiding.

On 3 August 1989, while Mustafa Mahmoud Mazeh was priming a book bomb loaded with [[RDX]] explosive in a hotel in [[Paddington]], Central London, the bomb exploded prematurely, destroying two floors of the hotel and killing Mazeh. A previously unknown [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] group, the Organization of the Mujahidin of Islam, said he died preparing an attack "on the [[apostate]] Rushdie". There is a shrine in Tehran's [[Behesht-e Zahra]] cemetery for Mustafa Mahmoud Mazeh that says he was "Martyred in London, 3 August 1989. The first martyr to die on a mission to kill Salman Rushdie." Mazeh's mother was invited to relocate to Iran, and the Islamic World Movement of Martyrs' Commemoration built his shrine in the cemetery that holds thousands of Iranian soldiers slain in the [[Iran–Iraq War]].<ref name="Tomb"/>

===''International Guerillas'' (1990)===
In 1990, soon after the publication of ''The Satanic Verses'', a [[Cinema of Pakistan|Pakistani film]] entitled ''[[International Guerillas|International Gorillay]]'' (''International Guerillas'') was released that depicted Rushdie as a villain plotting to cause the downfall of [[Pakistan]] by opening a chain of casinos and discos in the country; he is ultimately killed at the end of the movie. The film was popular with Pakistani audiences, and it "presents Rushdie as a [[John Rambo|Rambo]]-like figure pursued by four Pakistani guerrillas".<ref name="Tamney">{{cite book|title=The Resilience of Conservative Religion: The Case of Popular, Conservative Protestant Congregations|first=Joseph Bernard |last=Tamney|publisher=The Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge| location=Cambridge, UK|year=2002}}</ref> The [[British Board of Film Classification]] refused to allow it a certificate, as "it was felt that the portrayal of Rushdie might qualify as criminal libel, causing a breach of the peace as opposed to merely tarnishing his reputation." This effectively prevented the release of the film in the UK. Two months later, however, Rushdie himself wrote to the board, saying that while he thought the film "a distorted, incompetent piece of trash", he would not sue if it were released. He later said, "If that film had been banned, it would have become the hottest video in town: everyone would have seen it".

Meanwhile, Indian authors [[Ruchir Joshi]], [[Jeet Thayil]], [[Hari Kunzru]] and [[Amitava Kumar]] abruptly left the festival, and Jaipur, after reading excerpts from Rushdie's banned novel at the festival.

===Knighthood===
{{main|Knighthood of Salman Rushdie}}

Rushdie was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] for services to literature in the [[2007 Birthday Honours|Queen's Birthday Honours]] on 16 June 2007. He remarked: "I am thrilled and humbled to receive this great honour, and am very grateful that my work has been recognised in this way."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6756149.stm |work=BBC News|title=15 June 2007 Rushdie knighted in honours list |access-date=16 June 2007 | date=15 June 2007}}</ref> In response to his knighthood, many nations with Muslim majorities protested. Parliamentarians of several of these countries condemned the action, and Iran and Pakistan called in their British envoys to protest formally. Controversial condemnation issued by Pakistan's [[Ministry of Religious Affairs and Inter-faith Harmony (Pakistan)|Religious Affairs Minister]] [[Muhammad Ijaz-ul-Haq]] was in turn rebuffed by former Prime Minister [[Benazir Bhutto]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2193993/Salman-Rushdie-is-knighted-by-the-Queen.html|title=Salman Rushdie is knighted by the Queen|last=Pierce|first=Andrew|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=23 May 2017|language=en}}</ref> Several called publicly for his death. Some non-Muslims expressed disappointment at Rushdie's knighthood, claiming that the writer did not merit such an honour and there were several other writers who deserved the knighthood more than Rushdie.<ref>"Sir Rubbish: Does Rushdie Deserve a Knighthood", ''Times Higher Educational Supplement'', 20 June 2007.</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/20/world/asia/20iht-rushdie.1.6228425.html|title=Protests spread to Malaysia over knighthood for Salman Rushdie|date=20 June 2007|work=The New York Times|access-date=23 May 2017|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

[[Al-Qaeda]] condemned the Rushdie honour. The Al-Qaeda leader [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] is quoted as saying in an audio recording that UK's award for Kashmiri-born Rushdie was "an insult to Islam", and it was planning "a very precise response."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6289110.stm |work=BBC News|title=10 July 2007 Al-Qaeda condemns Rushdie honour  |access-date=10 July 2007 | date=10 July 2007}}</ref>

==Religious and political beliefs==

=== Religious background ===
Rushdie came from a [[Liberalism and progressivism within Islam|liberal Muslim]] family<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/salman-rushdie-39245|title=Salman Rushdie|website=Biography.com|language=en-us|access-date=11 October 2017}}</ref> but is now an [[atheist]]. In a 2006 interview with [[PBS]], Rushdie called himself a "hardline atheist".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/moyers/faithandreason/print/faithandreason101_print.html|title=Bill Moyers on Faith & Reason - Bill Moyers and Salman Rushdie |date=23 June 2006|website=[[PBS]]}}</ref>

In 1989, in an interview following the ''fatwa'', Rushdie said that he was in a sense a lapsed Muslim, though "shaped by Muslim culture more than any other", and a student of Islam.<ref name = Meer/> In another interview the same year, he said, "My point of view is that of a secular human being. I do not believe in supernatural entities, whether Christian, Jewish, Muslim or Hindu."<ref>{{cite news|title=Fact, faith and fiction|work=[[Far Eastern Economic Review]]|date=2 March 1989|page=11}}</ref>

In 1990, in the "hope that it would reduce the threat of Muslims acting on the fatwa to kill him," he issued a statement claiming he had renewed his Muslim faith, had repudiated the attacks on Islam made by characters in his novel, and was committed to working for better understanding of the religion across the world. However, Rushdie later said that he was only "pretending".<ref>[http://www.dnaindia.com/world/report_i-was-deranged-when-i-embraced-islam-rushdie_1158782 "Rushdie: I was deranged when I embraced Islam"], ''[[Daily News and Analysis]]'', 6 April 2008. Retrieved 14 September 2012.</ref>

Rushdie advocates the application of [[higher criticism]], pioneered during the late 19th century. Rushdie called for a reform in Islam<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,1072-1729998,00.html "Muslims unite! A new Reformation will bring your faith into the modern era"], ''The Times'', 11 August 2005</ref> in a guest opinion piece printed in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[The Times]]'' in mid-August 2005:

{{quote|What is needed is a move beyond tradition, nothing less than a reform movement to bring the core concepts of Islam into the modern age, a Muslim Reformation to combat not only the jihadist ideologues but also the dusty, stifling seminaries of the traditionalists, throwing open the windows to let in much-needed fresh air.… It is high time, for starters, that Muslims were able to study the revelation of their religion as an event inside history, not supernaturally above it.… Broad-mindedness is related to tolerance; open-mindedness is the sibling of peace.|author=|title=|source=}}

Rushdie is a critic of [[cultural relativism|moral relativism.]] He favours calling things by their true names and constantly argues about what is wrong and what is right. In an interview with [[Point of Inquiry]] in 2006, he described his view as follows:<ref>{{cite web|title=Salman Rushdie – Secular Values, Human Rights and Islamism|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/salman_rushdie_secular_values_human_rights_and_islamism/|access-date=11 October 2006|publisher=Point of Inquiry}}</ref>

{{quote|We need all of us, whatever our background, to constantly examine the stories inside which and with which we live. We all live in stories, so called grand narratives. Nation is a story. Family is a story. Religion is a story. Community is a story. We all live within and with these narratives. And it seems to me that a definition of any living vibrant society is that you constantly question those stories. That you constantly argue about the stories. In fact the arguing never stops. The argument itself is freedom. It's not that you come to a conclusion about it. And through that argument you change your mind sometimes.… And that's how societies grow. When you can't retell for yourself the stories of your life then you live in a prison.… Somebody else controls the story.… Now it seems to me that we have to say that a problem in contemporary Islam is the inability to re-examine the ground narrative of the religion.… The fact that in Islam it is very difficult to do this, makes it difficult to think new thoughts.|author=|title=|source=}}

Rushdie is an advocate of [[religious satire]]. He condemned the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting]] and defended comedic criticism of religions in a comment originally posted on [[English PEN]] where he called religions a medieval form of unreason. Rushdie called the attack a consequence of "religious totalitarianism" which according to him had caused "a deadly mutation in the heart of Islam":<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/07/salman-rushdie-charlie-hebdo_n_6430904.html|title= Salman Rushdie Responds To Charlie Hebdo Attack, Says Religion Must Be Subject To Satire|first= Maddie |last=Crum|work= [[Huffington Post]]|date= 7 January 2015|access-date= 20 June 2015}}</ref>

{{quote|Religion, a medieval form of unreason, when combined with modern weaponry becomes a real threat to our freedoms. This religious totalitarianism has caused a deadly mutation in the heart of Islam and we see the tragic consequences in Paris today. I stand with Charlie Hebdo, as we all must, to defend the art of satire, which has always been a force for liberty and against tyranny, dishonesty and stupidity. ‘Respect for religion’ has become a code phrase meaning ‘fear of religion.’ Religions, like all other ideas, deserve criticism, satire, and, yes, our fearless disrespect.}}

Rushdie is a self-professed [[Humanism|humanist]], believing that reading and writing is a pathway for understanding human existence. When asked about reading and writing as a human right Rushdie states, "the larger stories, the grand narratives that we live in, which are things like nation, and family, and clan, and so on. Those stories are considered to be treated reverentially. They need to be part of the way in which we conduct the discourse of our lives and to prevent people from doing something very damaging to human nature."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pen.org/press-clip/the-art-of-bravery-an-interview-with-salman-rushdie/|title=The Art of Bravery: An Interview with Salman Rushdie|work=Los Angeles Review of Books|via=PEN America|date=25 April 2013}}</ref> Though Rushdie believes the freedoms of literature to be universal, the bulk of his fictions portrays the struggles of the marginally underrepresented. This can be seen in his portrayal of the role of women in his novel ''[[Shame (Rushdie novel)|Shame]]''. In this novel, Rushdie, "suggests that it is women who suffer most from the injustices of the Pakistani social order."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Deszcz |first1=Justyna |title=Salman Rushdie's attempt at a feminist fairytale reconfiguration in ''Shame'' |journal=Folklore |date=April 2004 |volume=115 |issue=1 |pages=27–44 |id={{ProQuest|2152779627}} |doi=10.1080/0015587042000192510 |s2cid=145667781 }}</ref> His support of feminism can also be seen in a 2015 interview with ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine's ''[[New York (magazine)#The Cut|The Cut]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2015/11/15-famous-men-whether-theyre-feminists.html|title=15 Male Celebrities Answer 'Are You a Feminist?' |author=The Cut|work=The Cut}}</ref>

==== UK politics ====
In the 1980s, in the United Kingdom, he was a supporter of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], and championed measures to end racial discrimination and alienation of immigrant youth and racial minorities.

In 2006, Rushdie stated that he supported comments by the then-[[Leader of the House of Commons]] [[Jack Straw]], who [[United Kingdom debate over veils|criticised the wearing]] of the [[niqab]] (a veil that covers all of the face except the eyes). Rushdie stated that his three sisters would never wear the veil. He said, "I think the battle against the veil has been a long and continuing battle against the limitation of women, so in that sense I'm completely on Straw's side."<ref>{{cite web|last=Wagner|first=Thomas|date=10 October 2006|title=Blair, Rushdie support former British foreign secretary who ignited veil debate|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/world/20061010-0539-britain-veildispute.html|access-date=10 October 2006|publisher=SignOnSanDiego.com}}</ref>

Rushdie supported the election of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Barack Obama]] for the American presidency and has often criticized the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. He was involved in the [[Occupy Movement]], both as a presence at [[Occupy Boston]] and as a founding member of [http://occupywriters.com/ Occupy Writers].

==== Against religious extremism ====
In the wake of the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|''Jyllands-Posten'' Muhammad cartoons controversy]] in March 2006—which many considered an echo of the death threats and ''[[Fatwa|fatwā]]'' that followed publication of ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'' in 1989—Rushdie signed the manifesto ''Together Facing the New Totalitarianism'', a statement warning of the dangers of [[religious extremism]]. The Manifesto was published in the left-leaning French weekly ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'' in March 2006.<ref>{{cite news|date=1 March 2006|title=Writers issue cartoon row warning|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4763520.stm|access-date=19 February 2014}}</ref>

When [[Amnesty International]] suspended human rights activist [[Gita Sahgal]] for saying to the press that she thought the organization should distance itself from [[Moazzam Begg]] and his organisation, Rushdie said:<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article7034773.ece Salman Rushdie's statement on Amnesty International], ''The Sunday Times'', 21 February 2010</ref> <blockquote>Amnesty…has done its reputation incalculable damage by allying itself with Moazzam Begg and his group [[CagePrisoners|Cageprisoners]], and holding them up as human rights advocates. It looks very much as if Amnesty's leadership is suffering from a kind of [[moral bankruptcy]], and has lost the ability to distinguish right from wrong. It has greatly compounded its error by suspending the redoubtable Gita Sahgal for the crime of going public with her concerns. Gita Sahgal is a woman of immense integrity and distinction.… It is people like Gita Sahgal who are the true voices of the human rights movement; Amnesty and Begg have revealed, by their statements and actions, that they deserve our contempt.</blockquote>

==== Indian politics and Kashmir ====
In Indian politics, Rushdie has criticised the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] and its Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]].<ref name="bodeill">{{cite news|title=A Narendra Modi victory would bode ill for India, say Rushdie and Kapoor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/10/indian-artists-letter-guardian-worry-election |first=Jason |last=Burke |date=10 April 2014 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=Delhi |access-date=23 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/14/rushdie-atwood-restore-citizenship-critic-modi|title=Rushdie and Atwood join calls to restore citizenship to critic of Modi|last=Flood|first=Alison|date=14 November 2019|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=23 December 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

Rushdie laments the [[Kashmir conflict|division of Kashmir]] into zones of Pakistani and Indian administration as "cutting his family down the middle" in an interview about his book ''[[Shalimar the Clown]]''. In August 2019, he criticized the [[Revocation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir|communications-blackout and lockdown in Indian-administered Kashmir]], tweeting "Even from seven thousand miles away it’s clear that what’s happening in Kashmir is an atrocity. Not much to celebrate this August 15th."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/salmanrushdie/status/1162021115805491200?lang=en|title=Even from seven thousand miles away it's clear that what's happening in Kashmir is an atrocity.

And, frankly, without that the jihadists would have had very little response from the Kashmiri people who were not really traditionally interested in radical Islam. So now they're caught between the devil and the deep blue sea, and that's the tragedy of the place.… And really what I was trying to do was say exactly that the attraction of the jihad in Kashmir arose out of the activities of the Indian army. One of the most obvious facts about Kashmir is the gigantic amount of military equipment that's there everywhere: tanks, trucks, howitzers, bazookas, huge arms depots, endless arms convoys which go up these little mountain roads for six hours at a time from one end of the convoy to the other – and God help you if you're stuck behind it, because there's no way to pass it. </blockquote>
