'''Robert Penn Warren''' (April 24, 1905 – September 15, 1989) was an American poet, [[novelist]], and literary critic and was one of the founders of [[New Criticism]]. He was also a charter member of the [[Fellowship of Southern Writers]]. He founded the literary journal ''[[The Southern Review]]'' with [[Cleanth Brooks]] in 1935. He received the 1947 [[Pulitzer Prize for the Novel]] for ''[[All the King's Men]]'' (1946) and the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]] in 1958 and 1979. He is the only person to have won Pulitzer Prizes for both fiction and poetry.<ref>Nelson, Randy F. ''The Almanac of American Letters''. Los Altos, California: William Kaufmann, Inc., 1981: 27. {{ISBN|0-86576-008-X}}</ref>

==Early years==
Warren was born in [[Guthrie, Kentucky]], very near the [[Tennessee]]-[[Kentucky]] border, to Robert Warren and Anna Penn.<ref>Ehrlich, Eugene and Gorton Carruth. ''The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1982: 291. {{ISBN|0-19-503186-5}}</ref> Warren's mother's family had roots in Virginia, having given their name to the community of Penn's Store in [[Patrick County, Virginia]], and she was a descendant of Revolutionary War soldier Colonel [[Abram Penn]].<ref>[http://www.freestateofpatrick.com/pcpeople.htm Patrick County People, Free State of Patrick] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711040008/http://www.freestateofpatrick.com/pcpeople.htm |date=2011-07-11 }}</ref> 

Robert Penn Warren graduated from [[Clarksville High School (Tennessee)|Clarksville High School]] in [[Clarksville, Tennessee]]; [[Vanderbilt University]] ([[summa cum laude]], [[Phi Beta Kappa]]) in 1925; and the [[University of California, Berkeley]] (M.A.) in 1926. Warren pursued further graduate study at [[Yale University]] from 1927 to 1928 and obtained his [[B.Litt.]] as a [[Rhodes Scholar]] from [[New College, Oxford]], in England in 1930. He also received a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] to study in Italy during the rule of [[Benito Mussolini]]. That same year he began his teaching career at Southwestern College (now [[Rhodes College]]) in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].

==Career==
While still an undergraduate at Vanderbilt University, Warren became associated with the group of poets there known as the [[Fugitives (poets)|Fugitives]], and somewhat later, during the early 1930s, Warren and some of the same writers formed a group known as the [[Southern Agrarians]]. He contributed "The Briar Patch" to the [[Agrarianism|Agrarian]] manifesto ''[[I'll Take My Stand]]'' along with 11 other Southern writers and poets (including fellow Vanderbilt poet/critics [[John Crowe Ransom]], [[Allen Tate]], and [[Donald Davidson (poet)|Donald Davidson]]). In "The Briar Patch" the young Warren defends racial segregation, in line with  the political leanings of the Agrarian group, although Davidson deemed Warren's stances in the essay so progressive that he argued for excluding it from the collection.<ref>Wood, Edwin Thomas. "On Native Soil: A Visit with Robert Penn Warren," ''Mississippi Quarterly'' 38 (Winter 1984)</ref> However, Warren recanted these views in an article on the [[civil rights movement]], "Divided South Searches Its Soul", which appeared in the July 9, 1956 issue of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine. A month later, Warren published an expanded version of the article as a small book titled ''Segregation: The Inner Conflict in the South''.<ref>Metress, Christopher. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3549/is_n1_v32/ai_n28666757/ "Fighting battles one by one: Robert Penn Warren's ''Segregation''"]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''The Southern Review'', Winter 1996.</ref>  He subsequently adopted a high profile as a supporter of [[racial integration]]. In 1965, he published ''[[Who Speaks for the Negro?]]'', a collection of interviews with black civil rights leaders including [[Malcolm X]] and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], thus further distinguishing his political leanings from the more conservative philosophies associated with fellow Agrarians such as Tate, [[Cleanth Brooks]], and particularly Davidson. Warren's interviews with civil rights leaders are at the [[Louie B. Nunn Center for Oral History]] at the University of Kentucky.<ref>[https://kentuckyoralhistory.org/ark:/16417/xt7m901zgp82 Louie B. Nunn Center for Oral History]</ref>

Warren's best-known work is ''[[All the King's Men]]'', a novel that won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1947. Main character [[All the King's Men#Willie Stark|Willie Stark]] resembles [[Huey Pierce Long]] (1893–1935), the radical [[Populism|populist]] [[List of governors of Louisiana|governor of Louisiana]] whom Warren was able to observe closely while teaching at [[Louisiana State University]] in [[Baton Rouge]] from 1933 to 1942. The [[All the King's Men (1949 film)|1949 film by the same name]] was highly successful, starring [[Broderick Crawford]] and winning the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] in 1949. There was another [[All the King's Men (2006 film)|film adaptation in 2006]] featuring [[Sean Penn]] as Willie Stark. The opera ''[[Willie Stark]]'' by [[Carlisle Floyd]], to his own [[libretto]] based on the novel, was first performed in 1981.

Warren served as the [[Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress]], 1944–1945 (later termed [[Poet Laureate]]), and won two Pulitzer Prizes in poetry, in 1958 for ''Promises: Poems 1954–1956'' and in 1979 for ''Now and Then''. ''Promises'' also won the annual [[National Book Award for Poetry]].<ref name=nba1958>

In 1974, the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] selected him for the [[Jefferson Lecture]], the U.S. federal government's highest honor for achievement in the [[humanities]]. Warren's lecture was entitled "Poetry and Democracy" (subsequently published under the title ''Democracy and Poetry'').<ref name="jefflect">[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/jefflect.html Jefferson Lectures].

In 1981, Warren was selected as a [[MacArthur Fellow]] and later was named as the first U.S. [[Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry]] on February 26, 1986. In 1987, he was awarded the [[National Medal of Arts]].<ref>[http://www.nea.gov/honors/medals/medalists_year.html#87 Lifetime Honors - National Medal of Arts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721054307/http://www.nea.gov/honors/medals/medalists_year.html |date=2011-07-21 }}</ref>

Warren was co-author, with [[Cleanth Brooks]], of ''[[Understanding Poetry]]'', an influential literature textbook. It was followed by other similarly co-authored textbooks, including  ''Understanding Fiction'', which was praised by [[Southern Gothic]] and Roman Catholic writer [[Flannery O'Connor]], and ''Modern Rhetoric'', which adopted what can be called a [[New Critical]] perspective.

==Personal life==
His first marriage was to Emma Brescia. His second marriage was in 1952 to [[Eleanor Clark]], with whom he had two children, [[Rosanna Warren|Rosanna Phelps Warren]] (born 1953) and Gabriel Penn Warren (born 1955). During his tenure at Louisiana State University he resided at Twin Oaks (otherwise known as the [[Robert Penn Warren House]]) in Prairieville, Louisiana.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crt.state.la.us/hp/nationalregister/nhl/parish03/scans/03018001.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-10-18 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019140957/http://www.crt.state.la.us/hp/nationalregister/nhl/parish03/scans/03018001.pdf |archive-date=2013-10-19 }}</ref> He lived the latter part of his life in [[Fairfield, Connecticut]], and [[Stratton, Vermont]], where he died of complications from prostate cancer. He is buried at Stratton, Vermont, and, at his request, a memorial marker is situated in the Warren family gravesite in Guthrie, Kentucky.

==Legacy==
In April 2005, the [[United States Postal Service]] issued a commemorative stamp to mark the 100th anniversary of Warren's birth. Introduced at the post office in his native Guthrie, it depicts the author as he appeared in a 1948 photograph, with a background scene of a political rally designed to evoke the setting of ''All the King's Men''. His son and daughter, Gabriel and [[Rosanna Warren]], were in attendance.

[[Vanderbilt University]] houses the Robert Penn Warren Center for the Humanities, which is sponsored by the College of Arts and Science.<ref>[http://www.vanderbilt.edu/rpw_center/ Robert Penn Warren Center for the Humanities]</ref> It began its programs in January 1988, and in 1989 received a $480,000 Challenge Grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The center promotes "interdisciplinary research and study in the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences."

The high school that Robert Penn Warren attended, Clarksville High School (Tennessee), was renovated into an apartment complex in 1982. The original name of the apartments was changed to The Penn Warren in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Penn Warren - History|url=http://thepennwarren.com/history/|website=ThePennWarren.com|access-date=24 September 2014}}</ref>

In 2014 Vanderbilt University opened the doors to Warren College, one of the first 2 residential colleges at the university, along with Moore College.

He was a Charter member of the [[Fellowship of Southern Writers]].
