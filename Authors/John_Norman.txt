'''John Norman''' is the pen name of '''John Frederick Lange Jr.''' (born June 3, 1931), who is the author of the ''[[Gor]]'' series of [[science fantasy]] novels, and a professor of [[philosophy]].

== Early life and education ==
John Lange was born in [[Chicago]], Illinois, to John Frederick Lange and Almyra D. Lange (née Taylor).

He began his academic career in the early 1950s, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree from the [[University of Nebraska]] in 1953, and his Master of Arts degree from the [[University of Southern California]] in 1957. 

==Personal life==
Lange married Bernice L. Green on January 14, 1956 while he was still a student at USC. The couple have three children: John, David, and Jennifer.

== Academic career ==
Lange earned his PhD in 1963 from [[Princeton University]]. His dissertation was named: "In defence of ethical naturalism: an examination of certain aspects of naturalistic fallacy, with particular attention to the logic of an open question argument". Lange summed it up in an interview by saying "if one cannot make sense of morality within some sort of satisfying, natural context, then one is likely to end up with no morality, which is less than societally reassuring, or is likely to end up with a competitive plethora of moralities in which ninety-nine percent of the world's population is convinced that the other ninety-nine percent is unclean, stupid, uninformed, vicious, depraved, in need of coercive correction, and such. That too, seems less than reassuring."<ref name="PolygraffInterview">{{Citation |author=Polygraff Staff |year=2010 |title=An Exclusive Interview With John Norman, Author of the Gor Series of Novels. |periodical=[[Polygraff]] |place=Montreal |publisher=Polymancer Studios, Inc. |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=47–53 |issn= 	1918-655X |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/41530641/Polygraff-Magazine |access-date=2010-12-15}}</ref>

John Norman's [[Gor|Gorean Saga]] is a long-running series of adventure [[science fantasy]] novels, starting in December 1966 with ''Tarnsman of Gor''. The series was put on hold after its twenty-fifth installment, ''Magicians of Gor'', in 1988, when [[DAW Books|DAW]] refused to publish its successor, ''Witness of Gor''. After several unsuccessful attempts to find a trade publishing outlet, the series was brought back into print in 2001 with the publication of ''Witness of Gor''. Norman has also produced a separate science fiction series, the ''Telnarian Histories'', plus three other fiction works, five non-fiction works, and a collection of thirty short stories.

Norman has said that the three major influences on his work are [[Homer]], [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://io9.com/5783833/john-norman-the-philosopher-who-created-the-barbaric-world-of-gor|title = John Norman, the philosophy professor who created the barbaric world of Gor}}</ref>

== Themes ==
According to Norman, his Gor books are [[science fiction]] or adventure fantasy works which are also "intellectual, philosophical, and psychological novels".<ref>[http://io9.gizmodo.com/5783833/john-norman-the-philosopher-who-created-the-barbaric-world-of-gor John Norman, the philosophy professor who created the barbaric world of Gor iO9]. March 22, 2011.</ref> His fiction depicts fantastic worlds where [[Male dominance (BDSM)|male-dominated]] [[bondage (sexual)|bondage]] relationships are natural and widely practiced and respected culturally, whereas characteristics of modern society are criticized and philosophical themes are explored, specially from a [[Nietzsche]]an view.

Although the bondage in his ''[[Imaginative Sex]]'' guide is directed to sexual practices, the bondage and slavery presented on "Gor" follows along the lines of societal or legal slavery; a common way of life as reflected in ancient Rome and other societies. While the philosophy presented is unquestionably that of male dominance, male characters are themselves occasionally enslaved by powerful females. In an interview<ref name="PolygraffInterview"/> with ''[[Polygraff]]'' magazine, Norman stated that he believes that it is obvious that all societies are based on dominance and hierarchy.

His non-fiction works cover [[philosophy]], [[ethics]] and [[historiography]].
