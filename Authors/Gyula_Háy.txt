During [[World War II]], he lived for a time in [[Moscow]]'s [[Hotel Lux]], along with scores of other Communist exiles.<ref name="welt">Peter Dittmar, [https://www.welt.de/politik/article1311902/Der_steinerne_Zeuge_des_stalinistischen_Terrors.html "Der steinerne Zeuge des stalinistischen Terrors"] ''Die Welt'' (30 October 2007); retrieved 11 November 2011. {{in lang|de}}</ref>
