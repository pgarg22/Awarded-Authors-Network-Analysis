Foote personally recommended actor [[Robert Duvall]] for the part of [[List of To Kill a Mockingbird characters#Arthur .22Boo.22 Radley|Boo Radley]] in ''To Kill a Mockingbird'' after meeting him during a 1957 production of ''[[The Midnight Caller (play)|The Midnight Caller]]'' at [[Neighborhood Playhouse]] in [[New York City]]. The two would work together many more times in the future. Foote had described Duvall as "our number one actor."<ref name="Mercies"/>

Foote's script for the 1983 film ''[[Tender Mercies]]'' had been rejected by many [[United States of America|American]] [[film director]]s before [[Australia]]n director [[Bruce Beresford]] finally accepted it; Foote later said, "this film was turned down by every American director on the face of the globe."{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The film received five 1984 Academy Award nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] (which lost) and [[Academy Award for Writing Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] (which Foote won).<ref name=oscar1984>[https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1984 "Oscars.

Other film scripts include ''[[Baby the Rain Must Fall]]'' starring [[Steve McQueen]] and [[Lee Remick]], which was based on his play ''The Travelling Lady''. The film was directed by [[Robert Mulligan]] who had worked with Foote on ''To Kill a Mockingbird'' in 1962.<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/67873/Baby-the-Rain-Must-Fall/ ''Baby the Rain Must Fall''] tcm.com, accessed March 21, 2019</ref><ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/20116/To-Kill-a-Mockingbird/ ''To Kill a Mockingbird''] tcm.com, accessed March 21, 2019</ref>

Foote generally wrote screenplays that were based on his plays, such as the semi-autobiographic trilogy of ''[[1918 (1985 film)|1918]]'' (1985),<ref>[https://www.allmovie.com/movie/1918-v65 ''1918''] allmovie.com, accessed March 21, 2019</ref> ''[[On Valentine's Day]]'' (1986)<ref>[https://www.allmovie.com/movie/on-valentines-day-v36258 ''On Valentine's Day''] allmovie.com, accessed March 21, 2019</ref> and ''Courtship'' (1987).<ref>[https://www.allmovie.com/movie/courtship-v11245 ''Courtship''] allmovie.com, accessed March 21, 2019</ref> ''1918'' and ''On Valentine's Day'' were shot on location in [[Waxahachie, Texas]].

He also adapted works by other authors, such as [[John Steinbeck]] (''[[Of Mice and Men (1992 film)|Of Mice and Men]]'' directed by and starring [[Gary Sinise]] with [[John Malkovich]]).<ref>{{tcmdb title|85393|Of Mice and Men}}</ref>

In addition to Faulkner's ''Old Man'', he also adapted Faulkner's short story ''Tomorrow'' into a [[Tomorrow (1972 film)|1972 film]] starring Robert Duvall. Foote had previously adapted the story into a play for television's Playhouse 90 in 1960.<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/93548/Tomorrow/articles.html "''Tomorrow'' Article"] tcm.com, accessed March 22, 2019</ref> [[Leonard Maltin]], in his movie guide book, calls the movie the best film adaptation of any of Faulkner's work. On the subject of Faulkner, Foote said, "Faulkner I never met but evidently he liked [my adaptations] because he's allowed me to share the dramatic copyrights to both [[If I Forget Thee, Jerusalem|''Old Man'']] and [[Tomorrow (1972 film)|''Tomorrow'']]&nbsp;... So in other words, you have to get both our permissions to do it."<ref>Spenser, Stuart. [http://bombsite.com/issues/15/articles/764 "Horton Foote"], BOMBsite.com, Spring 1986</ref>

Playwright [[Lillian Hellman]] adapted his 1952 play and 1956 novel for the 1966 film ''[[The Chase (1966 film)|The Chase]]'', with [[Marlon Brando]], [[Jane Fonda]] and [[Robert Redford]].<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/19800/The-Chase/articles.html ''The Chase''] tcm.com, accessed March 22, 2019</ref><ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/19800/The-Chase/screenplay-info.html "Notes on ''The Chase''"] tcm.com, accessed March 22, 2019</ref><ref>Staff.

Foote provided the voice of [[Jefferson Davis]] for [[Ken Burns]]' critically acclaimed documentary, ''The Civil War'' (PBS, 1990), and adaptations of his plays ''The Habitation of Dragons'' (TNT, 1992) and ''Lily Dale'' (Showtime, 1996) preceded the Showtime production of ''Horton Foote's Alone'' (1997). His final work was the screenplay for ''[[Main Street (2010 film)|Main Street]]'', a 2010 dramatic film.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Honors and style==
Foote was awarded an honorary doctorate from [[Carson-Newman University]] in 2006.<ref>[http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/photos08.html "Horton Foote's Honorary Degree"] cn.edu, accessed March 21, 2019</ref>

He received an honorary doctorate of humane letters from [[Spalding University]] ([[Louisville, Kentucky]]) in 1987.

One of Foote's primary biographers is Dr. Gerald Wood, former chairman of the English Department at Carson-Newman. Books by Wood about Foote include ''Horton Foote and the Theater of Intimacy'' and ''Horton Foote: A Casebook'' (Taylor & Francis, 1998, {{ISBN|08-15-325444}}; rev. Routledge, 2014, {{ISBN|11-35-636028}}). Wood and Marion Castleberry co-edited ''The Voice of an American Playwright: Interviews with Horton Foote'' (Mercer University Press, 2012, {{ISBN|978-0881463972}}).

[[Baylor University]] also holds close ties with Foote. In 2002, Foote accepted the title as "Visiting Distinguished Dramatist" with the Baylor Department of Theatre Arts.<ref>[https://www.baylor.edu/mediacommunications/news.php?action=story&story=6511 "Baylor Festival Honors Legendary Playwright Horton Foote"] baylor.edu, February 5, 2004</ref>

[[Tess Harper]], an actress who worked with Foote on ''Tender Mercies'', described him as "America's [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]]. If he didn't study the [[Russia]]ns, he's a reincarnation of the Russians. He's a quiet man who writes quiet people." Regarding his own writing, Foote said, "I know that people think I have a certain style, but I think style is like the color of the eyes. I don't know that you choose that."<ref name="Mercies"/>

Foote made an effort to employ lifelike language in his writing, citing [[W. B. Yeats]]'s work as an example of this realistic approach. In an interview with playwright Stuart Spencer, Foote discusses his writing and material: "I think there's certain things you don't choose. I don't think that you can choose a style; I think a style chooses you. I think ''that's'' almost an unconscious choice. And I don't know that you can choose subject matter, really. I think that's almost an unconscious choice. I have a theory that from the time you're 12 years old all your themes are kind of locked in.".<ref>Spencer, Stuart.

The Fine Arts Building at the college located in [[Wharton, Texas]], Wharton County Junior College, is named the Horton Foote Theatre.
