'''Thomas Tickell''' (17 December 1685 – 23 April 1740) was a minor [[England|English]] poet and man of letters.

==Life==
The son of a clergyman, he was born at [[Bridekirk]] near [[Cockermouth]], [[Cumberland]]. He was educated at [[St Bees School]] 1695–1701,<ref>The story of St Bees 1583-1939. Pub the Old St Beghian Club.</ref> and in 1701 entered [[The Queen's College, Oxford]], taking his M.A. degree in 1709. He became fellow of his college in the next year, and in 1711 University Reader or Professor of Poetry. He did not take orders, but by a dispensation from the Crown was allowed to retain his fellowship until his marriage to Clotilda Eustace in 1726 in [[Dublin]]. 
Tickell acquired the name ‘Whigissimus’, because of his close association with the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] parliamentary party.

In 1717 he was appointed Under Secretary to [[Joseph Addison]], Secretary of State. In 1724 Tickell was appointed secretary to the [[Lord Justices (Ireland)|Lords Justices of Ireland]],  a post which he retained until his death in 1740, at [[Bath, England|Bath]], aged 54.

Tickell owned a house and small estate in [[Glasnevin]] on the banks of the [[River Tolka]], which later became the site of the [[Irish National Botanic Gardens|Botanic Gardens]]. A double line of yew trees (known as Addison's Walk) from Tickell's garden is incorporated into the Gardens.

He married in 1726 Clotilda Eustace, daughter and co-heiress of [[Maurice Eustace (Harristown MP)|Sir Maurice Eustace of Harristown]], [[County Kildare]], and his second wife Clotilda Parsons. Maurice was  in turn the nephew and heir of the immensely wealthy judge and landowner [[Maurice Eustace (Lord Chancellor)|Sir Maurice Eustace]], [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]]. Clotilde, who outlived her husband by more than fifty years, was described by her family as "a most  clever  and excellent lady". They had four  surviving children, including John, father of Richard. We have it on the authority of [[Samuel Johnson]]  that Tickell was a devoted family man and temperate in his habits.

His grandson [[Richard Tickell]] became a playwright and married [[Mary Linley]], of the Linley musical dynasty.

==Writing==
Tickell's success in literature, as in life, was largely due to the friendship of [[Joseph Addison]], who procured for him (1717) an under-secretaryship of state, to the chagrin of [[Richard Steele]], who from then on bore a grudge against Tickell. During the peace negotiations with [[France]], Tickell published in 1713 the ''[[Prospect of Peace]]''.

In 1715 he brought out a translation of the first book of the ''[[Iliad]]'' contemporaneously with [[Alexander Pope]]'s version. Addison's reported description of Tickell's version as the best that ever was in any language roused the anger of Pope, who assumed that Addison was the author. Addison instructed Tickell to collect his works, which were printed in 1721 under Tickell's editorship.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

''[[Kensington Gardens]]'' (1722), Tickell's longest poem, is sometimes viewed as inflated and pedantic. It has been said that Tickell's poetic powers were awakened by his admiration for the person and genius of Addison, and undoubtedly his best work is the sincere and dignified elegy addressed to Addison's stepson  [[Edward Rich, 7th Earl of Warwick]]  on Addison's death:{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

His ballad of ''Cohn and Mary'' was for a long time the most popular of his poems. Tickell contributed to ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'' and ''[[The Guardian (1713)|The Guardian]]''. *His ''Works'' were printed in 1749 and are included in [[Alexander Chalmers|Chalmers]]'s and other editions of the ''English Poets''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
