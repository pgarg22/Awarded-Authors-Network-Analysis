==Early life==
Cinda Williams was born in [[Springfield, Ohio]] in 1952. She began writing in high school before stopping to focus instead on college. She has a twin, Linda. Her fortune-telling grandmother and the Celtic magical beliefs in her native Jackson County heavily influenced her writing. She graduated from the [[University of Akron]] in 1975 with a BA in [[Philosophy]], and in 1981 received a post-baccalaureate in [[Nutrition]].  She received her master's degree in Nutrition from [[Case Western Reserve University]] in 1984.<ref name="bio">{{cite web |url=http://www.cindachima.com/About/Chima%20bio_extended_12-10.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720074810/http://www.cindachima.com/About/Chima%20bio_extended_12-10.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-20 }}</ref>

==Career==
Prior to becoming a novelist, Chima was a [[Dietitian#Clinical dietitians|clinical dietitian]] and filled several clinical management and leadership roles at the [[Cleveland Clinic]] and The MetroHealth System in Cleveland, where she directed the Clinical Nutrition Department and established the Diabetes Self-Management Program.  Chima was also a freelance contributor to ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' ([[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]) and other local and regional publications, focusing on health-related topics and personal essays about family life.<ref name=bio />

From 2004â€“2009, she was an assistant professor of nutrition at the University of Akron before leaving to write full-time.<ref name= bio />

When her sons were in their teens, she began writing again. Her efforts ended up becoming ''The Warrior Heir.''<ref>Something about the Author. Vol. 192. Detroit: Gale, 2009. p. 46-48</ref>  While she was shopping around ''The Warrior Heir'', she began a high fantasy series for adults called ''Star-Marked Warder''.  The series was never finished because the ''Heir Chronicles'' were picked up for publication, but the world of ''Star-Marked Warder'' was adapted for Chima's young adult high fantasy series ''Seven Realms'' (set a generation before) and ''Shattered Realms'' (refocusing the story on teenagers).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cindachima.com/Resources/FAQ.htm#SR2|title=Cinda Williams Chima's official web site|website=cindachima.com|access-date=2018-04-20}}</ref>
