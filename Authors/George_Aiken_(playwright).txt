'''George L. Aiken''' (December 19, 1830{{spaced ndash}}April 27, 1876) was a 19th-century American playwright and actor best known for writing the most popular of the numerous stage adaptations of [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''.

Aiken was a writer of [[dime novel]]s before he turned to theatre. He became an actor in the troupe of his cousin [[George C. Howard]]. In 1852, shortly after the publication of Stowe's ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'', Aiken wrote his stage adaptation. It was performed by Howard's company, with Aiken playing the hero George Harris. The play became a spectacular success. His other works include a dramatization of [[Ann S. Stephens]]' novel ''The Old Homestead''. He retired from the stage in 1867.

Aiken's original manuscripts for ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' were passed through the family along with other memorabilia from Howard's company. The family placed the collection at the [[Harry Ransom Center]] in 1963.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://norman.hrc.utexas.edu/fasearch/findingAid.cfm?eadid=00058|title=George C.
