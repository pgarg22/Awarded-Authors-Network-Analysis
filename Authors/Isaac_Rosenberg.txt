==Early life==
Isaac Rosenberg was born in [[Bristol]], the second of six children and the eldest son (his twin brother died at birth) of his parents, Barnett (formerly Dovber) and Hacha Rosenberg, who were Lithuanian [[Orthodox Judaism|Jewish]] immigrants to Britain from [[Daugavpils|Dvinsk]] (now in [[Latvia]]). In 1897, the family moved to [[Stepney (parish)|Stepney]], a poor district of the [[East End of London]], and one with a large [[Jewish]] community.<ref name=guardian-m-wilson/> Isaac Rosenberg attended St. Paul's Primary School at [[Wellclose Square]], [[St George in the East (parish)|St George in the East]] parish. Later, he went to the Baker Street Board School in Stepney, which had a strong Jewish presence.<ref name="Vivien Noakes">Vivien Noakes (Editor.)

Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008. See: Chronological Summary of Isaac Rozenberg's Life, pp. XXYII – XXXYI. During discussions of immigration issues in the House of Commons it was revealed that in Boys Department of the Baker Street Board School, Stepney, in 1901, there were "280 foreigners as against 29 English" pupils. — [https://books.google.com/books?id=1zc__1ZjtdMC&pg=PR801&lpg=PR801&dq=baker+street+board+school+stepney&source=bl&ots=Sd8qcvbTp6&sig=sa_Scbe5bOzWeJyCoUzOeCSaEYE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi9zofqqq_JAhXEyj4KHf2jBeUQ6AEIIzAC#v=onepage&q=baker%20street%20board%20school%20stepney&f=false Great Britain. Parliament. – 1902, p. 1274]</ref> In 1902, he received a good conduct award and was allowed to take classes at the Arts and Crafts School in Stepney Green. In December 1904, he left the Baker Street School, and in January 1905, started an apprenticeship with Carl Hentschel, an engraver from [[Fleet Street, London|Fleet Street]].<ref name=guardian-m-wilson />

He became interested in both poetry and [[visual art]], and started to attend evening classes at [[Birkbeck College]]. He withdrew from his apprenticeship in January 1911, as he had managed to find the finances to attend the [[Slade School of Fine Art]] at [[University College, London|University College]], London (UCL).<ref name=sewell-til>

He also exhibited paintings at the [[Whitechapel Gallery]] in 1914.

Afraid that his [[Bronchitis#Chronic bronchitis|chronic bronchitis]] would worsen, Rosenberg hoped to cure himself by relocating in 1914 to the warmer climate of South Africa, where his sister Mina lived in [[Cape Town]].<ref name=guardian-m-wilson/> The Jewish Educational Aid Society of London helped by paying the fare.

After arriving in Cape Town in the end of June 1914,<ref name="Vivien Noakes" /> he composed a poem ''On Receiving News of the War''. While many wrote about war as patriotic sacrifice, Rosenberg was critical of it from the outset. However, feeling better and hoping to find employment as an artist in Britain, Rosenberg returned home in March 1915.<ref name="Vivien Noakes" /> He published a second collection of poems, ''Youth'' and then after being unable to find a permanent job enlisted in the British Army at the end of October 1915.<ref name="Vivien Noakes" /> He asked that half of his pay be sent to his mother.<ref>[http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/188164/the-forgotten-jewish-great-war-poet-revived The Forgotten Jewish Great War Poet, Revived:  Long-gone writer is introduced to new readers with the help of graphic art], Tablet, 8 January 2015.</ref>

In a personal letter, Rosenberg described his attitude towards war, "I never joined the army for patriotic reasons. Nothing can justify war. I suppose we must all fight to get the trouble over."<ref>Field, F. (1991). British and French writers of the First World War: Comparative studies in cultural history. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, p. 235.</ref>

==First World War==
[[File:IsaacRosenberg.jpg|thumb|200px|Private Rosenberg, personal service number 22311]]
Rosenberg was assigned to the 12th Bantam Battalion of the [[Suffolk Regiment]], a ''[[Bantam (military)|bantam]]'' being a designation for men under the usual minimum height of 5'3". After apparently declining a promotion to [[lance corporal]], Rosenberg was transferred, first, to the [[South Lancashire Regiment]], then to the [[King's Own Royal Lancaster Regiment]]. He was sent with his unit to serve on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in France, where he arrived on 3 June 1916.<ref name="Vivien Noakes" /> He continued to write poetry while serving in the trenches, including "Break of Day in the Trenches", "Returning We Hear the Larks", and "Dead Man's Dump". In December 1916, [[Poetry (magazine)|''Poetry'' Magazine]] published two of his poems.<ref name="Vivien Noakes" />

In January 1917, Rosenberg reported sick and his family and friends asked his superiors to remove him from the front lines; he was transferred to the Fortieth Division Works Battalion and started to deliver barbed wire to the trenches.<ref name="Vivien Noakes" /> He wrote his poem ''Dead Man's Dump'' during this period.

In June, he was temporarily assigned to the 229 Field Company, Royal Engineers. In September 1916, he spent ten days in London on leave.<ref name="Vivien Noakes" /> After returning to his old unit, he fell sick in October and spent two months in the 51st General Hospital. After release, he was transferred to the 1st Battalion of the [[King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster)|King's Own Royal Regiment]] (KORL).<ref name="Vivien Noakes" /> He applied for a transfer to one of the all-Jewish battalions formed in [[Mesopotamia]], but historians have been unable to trace his application.<ref>Wilson, J. M. (2009).

On 21 March 1918, the German Army started its [[German spring offensive|Spring Offensive]] on the Western Front. A week later, Rosenberg sent his last letter with a poem "Through These Pale Cold Days" to England before going to the front lines with reinforcements.<ref name="Vivien Noakes" /> Having just finished a night patrol, he was killed on the night of 1 April 1918 with another ten KORL soldiers; there is a dispute as to whether his death occurred at the hands of a sniper or in close combat. In either case, he died in a town called [[Fampoux]], north-east of [[Arras]]. He was first buried in a mass grave, but in 1926 the unidentified remains of the six KORL soldiers were individually re-interred at Bailleul Road East Cemetery, Plot V, [[Saint-Laurent-Blangy]], [[Pas de Calais]], France.<ref>{{cite web
