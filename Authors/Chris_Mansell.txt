'''Chris Mansell''' (born 1953) is an Australian [[poet]] and [[publisher]].

Born in [[Sydney]], Chris Mansell grew up on the Central Coast of [[New South Wales]] and in [[Lae, Papua New Guinea]], later studying economics at the [[University of Sydney]].<ref>[http://www.chrismansell.com/Background.html Background] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231057/http://www.chrismansell.com/Background.html |date=3 March 2016 }} (Chris Mansell website) Accessed: 5 February 2007.</ref> She was active in Sydney in the 1970s and 1980s as an editor and poet and since the 1980s has lived on the south coast of NSW, Australia where she continues to write, perform, publish and edit. In 1978 she and [[Dane Thwaites]] began a magazine called ''Compass Poetry & Prose'' which published many of the young Australian poets of the time. She closed the magazine in 1987 and soon after, was a member of the collective (which included [[David Reiter]] among others) who founded Five Islands Press. She now runs PressPress, a small independent poetry press she founded in 2002.<ref>[http://www.presspress.com.au PressPress website] Accessed: 10 August 2007.</ref>

Like many poets of her generation, Mansell has made her living by performing her work, publishing and teaching writing at various institutions. Primarily a poet, she has also written a number of plays including ''Some Sunny Day''. Her collection ''Mortifications & Lies'' has been described as a 'groundbreaking work' because of its experimentation with form and its overtly political content.<ref>[[Margaret Bradstock]] quoted on [http://www.austlit.com/a/mansell/index.html Chris Mansell Contents page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061027155144/http://www.austlit.com/a/mansell/index.html |date=27 October 2006 }} (Australian Literature Resources) Accessed 5 February 2007.</ref> ''Love Poems'' is less political, a ''livre compos√©'' which takes subtler formal risks. ''Spine Lingo: new and selected poems'' appeared with Kardoorair in 2011. Always interested in experimentation with form, she now also works in digital media and artist editions which are experimental in physical form as well as content. On this front, her newest works (''Stung'' and ''Stung More'') comprise poems in the 'quad' form which combines strict restrictions with uninhibited content.<ref>[http://www.chrismansell.com/Stung.html Stung]</ref> The quads definitive collection is in ''101 Quads''.<ref>[https://puncherandwattmann.com/books/book/101-quads 101 Quads]</ref><ref>(Chris Mansell website) Accessed: 14  December 2014.</ref> She directed the Shoalhaven Poetry Festival in 2002, 2003 and 2005.

She was winner of the [[Queensland Premier's Literary Award]] (poetry) and has been shortlisted for the NSW Premier's Literature Award, and the Banjo Award (Victoria). She won the Meanjin Dorothy Porter Poetry Prize in 2014.
