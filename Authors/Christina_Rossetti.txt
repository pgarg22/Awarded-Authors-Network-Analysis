'''Christina Georgina Rossetti''' (5 December 1830 – 29 December 1894) was an English writer of [[romanticism|romantic]], devotional and children's poems, including "[[Goblin Market]]" and "Remember". She also wrote the words of two Christmas carols well known in Britain: "[[In the Bleak Midwinter]]", later set by [[Gustav Holst]] and [[Harold Darke]], and "[[Love Came Down at Christmas]]", also set by Darke and other composers. She was a sister of the artist and poet [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and features in several of his paintings.

==Early life and education==
Christina Rossetti was born in [[Charlotte Street]] (now [[Hallam Street]]), London, to [[Gabriele Rossetti]], a poet and a political exile from [[Vasto]], Abruzzo, Italy, since 1824 and [[Frances Polidori]], the sister of [[Lord Byron]]'s friend and physician [[John William Polidori]].<ref name="Poets.org">[http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/716 Profile at Poets.org]</ref> She had two brothers and a sister: [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti|Dante Gabriel]] became an influential artist and poet, and [[William Michael Rossetti|William Michael]] and [[Maria Francesca Rossetti|Maria]] both became writers.<ref name="Poets.org"/> Christina, the youngest and a lively child, dictated her first story to her mother before she had learnt to write.<ref>"Author Profile: Christina Rossetti", ''Literary Worlds'', BYU.edu, Web, 19 May 2011.</ref><ref name="ODNB">[https://doi.org/10.1093/ref:odnb/24139 Lindsay Duguid: "Rossetti, Christina Georgina (1830–1894)". ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford: OUP, 2009. Retrieved 15 October 2018.]</ref>

Rossetti was educated at home by her mother and father, through religious works, classics, fairy tales and novels. Rossetti delighted in the works of [[John Keats|Keats]], [[Walter Scott|Scott]], [[Ann Radcliffe]] and [[Matthew Lewis (writer)|Matthew Lewis]].<ref name="Packer13"/> The influence of the work of [[Dante Alighieri]], Petrarch and other Italian writers filled the home and impacted Rossetti's later writing. Their household was open to visiting Italian scholars, artists and revolutionaries.<ref name="ODNB"/> The family homes in [[Bloomsbury]] at 38 and later 50 [[Charlotte Street]] were within easy reach of [[Madam Tussauds]], London Zoo and the newly opened [[Regent's Park]], which she visited regularly. Unlike her parents, Rossetti was much of a London child and seemingly a happy one.<ref name="ODNB"/><ref name="Packer13">Packer, Lona Mosk (1963) ''Christina Rossetti'' University of California Press, pp. 13–17.</ref>

[[File:Christina Rossetti 2.jpg|thumb|right|''Christina Rossetti'', by her brother [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]]]
In the 1840s, her family faced financial troubles due to a deterioration in her father's physical and mental health. In 1843, he was diagnosed with persistent bronchitis, possibly tuberculosis, and faced losing his sight. He gave up his teaching post at King's College and though he lived another 11 years, suffered from depression and was never physically well again. Rossetti's mother began teaching to keep the family and Maria became a live-in governess, a prospect that Christina Rossetti dreaded. At the time her brother William was working for the Excise Office and Gabriel was at art school, leaving Christina increasingly isolated at home.<ref name="Packer20">Packer, Lona Mosk (1963) ''Christina Rossetti'' University of California Press, p. 20.</ref> When she was 14, she suffered a nervous breakdown and left school. Bouts of [[depression (mood)|depression]] and related illness followed. During this period she, her mother and her sister became absorbed in the [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholic]] movement that developed in the [[Church of England]]. Religious devotion came to play a major role in her life.

In her late teens, Rossetti became engaged to the painter [[James Collinson]], the first of three suitors. He, like her brothers Dante and William, was a founding member of the [[avant-garde]] [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]], established in 1848.<ref name="Packer29">Packer, Lona Mosk (1963) ''Christina Rossetti'' University of California Press, p. 29.</ref> The engagement was broken in 1850 when he reverted to [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]]. In 1853, when the family had financial difficulties, Christina helped her mother keep a school in Fromefield, [[Frome]], but it did not succeed. A plaque marks the house.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://fromesociety.wordpress.com/plaques/ |title=Plaques |date=16 June 2016 |language=en |access-date=2 June 2019}}</ref> In 1854 the pair returned to London, where Christina's father died.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Christina-Rossetti |title=Christina Rossetti {{!}} English poet |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |language=en|access-date=2 June 2019}}</ref> She later became involved with the linguist [[Charles Cayley]], but declined to marry him, also for religious reasons.<ref name="Packer29"/> A third offer came from the painter [[John Brett (artist)|John Brett]], whom she likewise refused.<ref name="ODNB"/>

Rossetti sat for several of Dante Gabriel Rossetti's paintings. In 1848, she sat for the Virgin Mary in his first completed oil painting, ''The Girlhood of Mary Virgin'', and the first work he inscribed with the initials "PRB", later revealed as standing for the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]].<ref>[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?workid=12802&roomid=3452 Tate Gallery]</ref> The following year she modelled for his depiction of the [[Annunciation]], ''[[Ecce Ancilla Domini]]''. A line from her poem "Who shall deliver me?" inspired a painting by [[Fernand Khnopff]] called ''I lock my door upon myself''. In 1849 she again became seriously ill with depression, and around 1857 had a major religious crisis.<ref name="ODNB"/>

==Career==
[[File:Rossetti-golden head.jpg|thumb|Illustration for the cover of Christina Rossetti's ''[[Goblin Market]] and Other Poems'' (1862), by her brother [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]]]
From 1842 Rossetti began writing out and dating her poems. Most of them imitated her favoured poets. In 1847 she began experimenting with verse forms such as [[sonnet]]s, hymns and [[ballad]]s, while drawing narratives from the Bible, folk tales and the lives of saints. Her early pieces often meditate on death and loss in the Romantic tradition.<ref name="Packer13"/> Her first two poems published were "Death's Chill Between" and "Heart's Chill Between", in the ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenaeum]]'' magazine in 1848.<ref name=enotes>"Christina Rossetti (1830–1894)," eNotes.com, Web, 19 May 2011.</ref><ref>Jan Marsh, [http://www.penguinclassics.co.uk/nf/shared/WebDisplay/0,,49155_1_10,00.html Christina Rossetti and the Pre–Raphaelite Brotherhood] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530235502/http://www.penguinclassics.co.uk/nf/shared/WebDisplay/0,,49155_1_10,00.html |date=30 May 2012}}</ref> She used the pseudonym "Ellen Alleyne" in the literary periodical, ''[[The Germ (periodical)|The Germ]]'', published by the Pre-Raphaelites from January to April 1850 and edited by her brother William.<ref name="Poets.org"/> This marked the beginning of her public career.<ref name="Cambridge">''The Cambridge Companion to English Poets'' (2011), Claude Rawson, Cambridge University Press, pp. 424–429.</ref>

Rossetti's more critical reflections on the artistic movement her brother had begun were expressed in an 1856 poem "In the Artist's Studio". Here she reflects on seeing multiple paintings of the same model. For Rossetti, the artist's idealised vision of the model's character begins to overwhelm his work, until "every canvas means/the one same meaning."<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Roe |first1=Dinah |title=The Pre-Raphaelites: From Rossetti to Ruskin |date=2010 |publisher=Penguin Classics |page=182}}</ref> Dinah Roe, in her introduction to the Penguin Classics collection of Pre-Raphaelite poetry, argues that this critique of her brother and similar male artists is less about "the objectification of women" than about "the male artist's self-worship".<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Roe |first1=Dinah |title=The Pre-Raphaelites: From Rossetti to Ruskin |date=2010 |publisher=Penguin Classics |page=xxvii}}</ref>

Rossetti's prime collection, ''[[Goblin Market and Other Poems]]'', appeared in 1862, when she was 31. It was widely praised by critics, who placed her as the foremost female poet of the day. She was lauded by [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]], [[Algernon Swinburne]] and [[Tennyson]],<ref name="Cambridge"/> and on the death of [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]] in 1861 was named her natural successor.<ref name="Cambridge"/> The title poem, one of her best known, is ostensibly about two sisters' misadventures with goblins, but critics have seen it in various ways as an allegory of temptation and salvation, a comment on Victorian gender roles and female agency, and a work of erotic desire and social redemption. Rossetti worked voluntarily in 1859–1870 at the [[Magdalene asylum|St Mary Magdalene house of charity]] in [[Highgate]], a refuge for ex-prostitutes. It is suggested that ''Goblin Market'' may have been inspired by "fallen women" she came to know.<ref name="Packer155">Lona Mosk Packer, (1963), ''Christina Rossetti'', University of California Press, p. 155.</ref> There are parallels with [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'' in religious themes of temptation, sin and redemption by vicarious suffering.<ref>Constance W. Hassett, (2005), ''Christina Rossetti: the patience of style'', University of Virginia Press, p. 15.</ref> [[Algernon Swinburne|Swinburne]] in 1883 dedicated ''A Century of Roundels'' to Rossetti, as she adopted his [[roundel (poetry)|roundel]] form in a number of poems, for instance in ''Wife to Husband''.<ref>Christina Rossetti, ''The Complete Poems'', Penguin Books, London, 2001 {{ISBN|9780140423662}}.</ref> She was ambivalent about [[women's suffrage]], but many have found [[feminist]] themes in her work.<ref>Pieter Liebregts and Wim Tigges, eds. (1996) ''Beauty and the Beast: Christina Rossetti''. Rodopi Press, p. 43.</ref> She opposed [[slavery in the United States]], [[cruelty to animals]] in prevalent [[vivisection]] and exploitation of girls in under-age prostitution.<ref>Hoxie Neale Fairchild (1939), ''Religious Trends in English Poetry'', Vol. 4, Columbia University Press.</ref>

Rossetti kept a wide circle of friends and correspondents and continued to write and publish for the rest of her life mainly devotional work and children's poetry. In 1892, she wrote ''The Face of the Deep'', a book of devotional prose, and oversaw an enlarged edition of ''Sing-Song'' in 1893.<ref name="Harrison">Antony H.

==Later life==
{{Quote box |width=350px |align=right|quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right
 |quote =<poem>
'''Song'''
When I am dead, my dearest,
 Sing no sad songs for me;
Plant thou no roses at my head,
 Nor shady cypress tree:
Be the green grass above me
 With showers and dewdrops wet:
And if thou wilt, remember,
 And if thou wilt, forget.

I shall not see the shadows,
 I shall not feel the rain;
I shall not hear the nightingale
 Sing on as if in pain:
And dreaming through the twilight
 That doth not rise nor set,
Haply I may remember,
 And haply may forget.
</poem>|source=1862<ref>The Norton Anthology of Poetry (revised shorter edition), {{ISBN|0-393-09251-8}}.</ref>}}

In the later decades of her life, Rossetti suffered from a type of [[hyperthyroidism]] – [[Graves' disease]] – diagnosed in 1872, suffering a near-fatal attack in the early 1870s.<ref name="Poets.org"/><ref name="ODNB"/> In 1893, she developed breast cancer. The tumour was removed, but there was a recurrence in September 1894.

Christina Rossetti died on 29 December 1894 and was buried on New Year's Day 1895 in the family grave on the west side of [[Highgate Cemetery]].<ref name="Harrison"/><ref>Scott Wilson, ''Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons'', 3rd ed.: 2 (Kindle Locations 40725-40726). McFarland & Company, Inc., publishers. Kindle Edition.</ref> There she joined her father, mother and [[Elizabeth Siddal]], wife of her brother Dante Gabriel. Her brother William was also buried there in 1919, as were the ashes of four subsequent family members.

There is a stone tablet on the façade of 30 Torrington Square, [[Bloomsbury]], marking her final home, where she died.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.londonremembers.com/memorials/christina-rossetti |title=Christina Rossetti: London Remembers |publisher=londonremembers.com |access-date=22 November 2013}}</ref>

==Recognition==
Rossetti's popularity in her lifetime did not approach that of her contemporary [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]], but her standing remained strong after her death. Her popularity faded in the early 20th century in the wake of [[Modernist poetry in English|Modernism]], but scholars began to explore Freudian themes in her work, such as religious and [[sexual repression]], reaching for personal, biographical interpretations of her poetry.<ref name="ODNB"/> Academics studying her work in the 1970s saw beyond the lyrical sweetness to her mastery of [[Metre (poetry)|prosody]] and [[Poetry|versification]]. Feminists held her as symbol of constrained female genius and a leader among 19th-century poets.<ref name="Poets.org"/><ref name="ODNB"/> Her writings strongly influenced writers such as [[Ford Madox Ford]], [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]], [[Elizabeth Jennings]], and [[Philip Larkin]]. The critic [[Basil de Sélincourt]] called her "all but our greatest woman poet... incomparably our greatest craftswoman... probably in the first twelve of the masters of English verse."<ref name="ODNB"/><ref>''TLS'', 4 December 1930.</ref>

The year stood at its equinox,
  And bluff the North was blowing.
A bleat of lambs came from the flocks,
  Green hardy things were growing.
I met a maid with shining locks,
  Where milky kine were lowing.

She wore a kerchief on her neck,
  Her bare arm showed its dimple.
Her apron spread without a speck,
  Her air was frank and simple.

Rossetti's Christmas poem "[[In the Bleak Midwinter]]" became widely known in the English-speaking world after her death, when set as a Christmas carol by [[Gustav Holst]] and later by [[Harold Darke]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts_and_culture/7752029.stm BBC article ''Bleak Midwinter named best carol'' Thursday, 27 November 2008]</ref> Her poem "[[Love Came Down at Christmas]]" (1885) has also been widely arranged as a carol.<ref>[http://www.hymnsandcarolsofchristmas.com/Hymns_and_Carols/love_came_down_at_christmas.htm Hymns and Carols of Christmas](2003) Brother Tristam, Hymns Ancient and Modern Ltd, p. 172 {{ISBN|9781853114793}}(Episcopal Church (United States))#April|honoured with a feast day]] on the liturgical calendar of the Anglican Church on 27 April.</ref><ref name="CofE">[http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/texts/the-calendar/holydays.aspx ChurchofEngland.org, Holy Days calendar]</ref>

British composers receptive to Rossetti's verse included [[Alexander Mackenzie (composer)|Alexander Mackenzie]] (''Three Songs'', Op. 17, 1878), [[Frederick Cowen]], [[Samuel Coleridge-Taylor]] (''Six Sorrow Songs'', Op. 57, 1904), [[Charles Hubert Parry|Hubert Parry]] and [[Charles Villiers Stanford]].<ref>[http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2013/aug13/Singing_bird_SH076.htm ''My Heart is Like a Singing Bird: Song settings of poetry by Christina Rossetti''], Sheva CD SH076 (2013)</ref> In 1918, [[John Ireland (composer)|John Ireland]] set eight poems from her ''Sing-Song: A Nursery Rhyme Book'' to music in his [[song cycle]] ''[[Mother and Child (John Ireland)|Mother and Child]]''.

In 2000, as one of many Millennium projects across the country, a poetry stone was placed in what had been the grounds of North Hill House in Frome. On one side is an excerpt from her poem, "What Good Shall My Life Do Me": "Love lights the sun: love through the dark/Lights the moon's evanescent arc:/Same Love lights up the glow-worms spark." She wrote of her brief stay in Frome, which had "an abundance of green slopes and gentle declivities: no boldness or grandeur but plenty of peaceful beauty".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.discoverfrome.co.uk/poetry-millennium-green/ |title=Poetry on the Millennium Green |date=29 September 2016 |website=Discover Frome |language=en-GB |access-date=14 August 2019}}</ref>
