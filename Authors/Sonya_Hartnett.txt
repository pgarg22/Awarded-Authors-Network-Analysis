'''Sonya Louise Hartnett''' (born 1968)<ref name=NLA/> is an Australian author of fiction for adults, [[adolescence|young adults]], and [[Children's literature|children]]. She has been called "the finest Australian writer of her generation".<ref name=craven/> For her career contribution to "children's and young adult literature in the broadest sense" Hartnett won the [[Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award]] from the Swedish Arts Council in 2008, the biggest prize in children's literature.<ref name=alma2008/><ref name=cassin/>

She has published books as Sonya Hartnett, S. L. Hartnett, and Cameron S. Redfern.<ref name=NLA/><ref name=austlit/>

==Writer==

Hartnett was born in [[Box Hill, Victoria]]. She was thirteen years old when she wrote her first novel and fifteen when it was published for the adult market in Australia, ''Trouble All the Way'' ([[Adelaide]]: Rigby Publishers, 1984).<ref>It has been classified as Juvenile Fiction by some libraries. {{worldcat |oclc=27549040 |Trouble All the Way}}. Retrieved 3 June 2013.</ref><ref name=Eccleshare/> For years she has written about one novel annually.<ref name=austlit/> Although she is often classified as a writer of young adult fiction, Hartnett does not consider this label entirely accurate: "I've been perceived as a young adult writer whereas my books have never really been young adult novels in the sort of classic sense of the idea." She believes the distinction is not so important in Britain as in her native land.<ref>[http://www.achuka.co.uk/interviews/hartnett1.php "Sonya Hartnett: London, 2002"] (interview, part 1 of 5). ACHUKA (''achuka.co.uk''). 2002.</ref>

According to the [[National Library of Australia]], "The novel for which Hartnett has achieved the most critical (and controversial) acclaim was ''Sleeping Dogs''" (1995). "A book involving incest between brother and sister and often critiqued as 'without hope', Sleeping Dogs generated enormous discussion both within Australia and overseas."<ref name=NLA/>

Many of Hartnett's books have been published in the UK and in North America. For ''Thursday's Child'' (2000, UK 2002), she won the annual [[Guardian Children's Fiction Prize]], a once-in-a-lifetime book award judged by a panel of British children's writers.<ref name=prize2002/><ref name=relaunch/><!-- eligible for Guardian Prize in 2002 because her first book published in UK --> In 2008 she won the [[Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award]] which is administered by the Swedish Arts Council.<ref>{{cite web |title=A Sense of Empathy and Involvement - ALMA |url=http://www.alma.se/en/Laureates/2008-Sonya-Hartnett-/Sonya-Hartnett--award-winner-2008/ |website=www.alma.se |access-date=16 January 2019}}</ref>

==''Landscape with Animals'' controversy==

In 2006, Hartnett was involved with some controversy regarding the publication of ''Landscape with Animals'', published under the pseudonym Cameron S. Redfern. The book contains many sex scenes and Hartnett was almost immediately "outed" as the author. She said that she wanted to avoid the book being accidentally shelved with her work for children in libraries and denied that she used a pseudonym to evade responsibility for the work or as a [[publicity stunt]] à la Nikki Gemmell's ''[[The Bride Stripped Bare (novel)|The Bride Stripped Bare]]''.<ref name=faking/> In a review published in ''[[The Age]]'', [[Peter Craven (literary critic)|Peter Craven]] savaged the book describing it as an "overblown little sex shocker", a "tawdry little crotch tickler" and lamented that Hartnett was "too good a writer to put her name to this indigestible hairball of spunk and spite".<ref name="craven"/> It was defended vigorously in ''[[The Australian]]'' by [[Marion Halligan]] ("I haven't read many books by Hartnett, but I think this is a much more amazing piece of writing than any of them") who chastised Craven for missing the joke ("How could an experienced critic get that so wrong?") and wonders why female authors writing frankly about sex is so frowned upon.<ref>Marion Halligan (24 June 2006).
