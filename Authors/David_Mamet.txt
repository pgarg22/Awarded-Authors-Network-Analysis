Mamet's first produced screenplay was the 1981 production of ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (1981 film)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'', based on [[James M. Cain]]'s novel.

When Mamet adapted his play for the 1992 film ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross (film)|Glengarry Glen Ross]]'', he wrote an additional part (including the monologue "[[Coffee's for closers]]") for [[Alec Baldwin]].

Mamet continues to work with an informal repertory company for his films, including Crouse, [[William H. Macy]], [[Joe Mantegna]], and [[Rebecca Pidgeon]], as well as the aforementioned school friends.

David did a rewrite of the script for ''[[Ronin (film)|Ronin]]'' under the pseudonym "Richard Weisz" and turned in an early version of a script for ''[[Malcolm X (1992 film)|Malcolm X]]'' which was rejected by director [[Spike Lee]].<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Simpson |first=Janet |title=The Battle To Film Malcolm X |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,975087-1,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105112509/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,975087-1,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 5, 2008 |magazine=Time |access-date=March 20, 2007 | date=March 16, 1992}}</ref> In 2000, Mamet directed a film version of ''[[Beckett on Film#Catastrophe|Catastrophe]],'' a one-act play by [[Samuel Beckett]] featuring [[Harold Pinter]] and [[John Gielgud]] (in his final screen performance). In 2008, he directed and wrote the [[mixed martial arts]] movie ''[[Redbelt]],'' about a martial arts instructor tricked into fighting in a professional bout.

In ''[[On Directing Film]]'', Mamet asserts that directors should focus on getting the point of a scene across, rather than simply following a protagonist, or adding visually beautiful or intriguing shots. Films should create order from disorder in search of the objective.

He directed a third-season episode of ''[[The Shield]]'' with [[Shawn Ryan]]. In 2007, Mamet directed two television commercials for [[Ford Motor Company]]. The two 30-second ads featured the [[Ford Edge]] and were filmed in Mamet's signature style of fast-paced dialogue and clear, simple imagery. Mamet's sister, [[Lynn Mamet|Lynn]], is a producer and writer for television shows, such as ''The Unit'' and ''Law & Order''.

Mamet has contributed several dramas to [[BBC Radio]] through Jarvis & Ayres Productions, including an adaptation of ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross]]'' for [[BBC Radio 3]] and new dramas for [[BBC Radio 4]].

During promotion of a book, Mamet said British people had "a taint of [[antisemitism|anti-semitism]]," claiming they "want to give [Israel] away to some people whose claim is rather dubious."<ref name="Gapper">{{cite news|last=Gapper |first=John |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/ft/2011/06/lunch_with_david_mamet.html?via=gdpr-consent|title=Lunch With David Mamet|work=Slate|agency=Financial Times|date=June 11, 2011|access-date=August 6, 2018}}</ref> In the same interview, Mamet went on to say that "there are famous dramatists and novelists [in the UK] whose works are full of anti-Semitic filth."

In an essay for ''[[Newsweek]]'', published on January 29, 2013, Mamet argued against [[gun control]] laws: "It was intended to guard us against this inevitable decay of government that the Constitution was written. Its purpose was and is not to enthrone a Government superior to an imperfect and confused electorate, but to protect us from such a government."<ref>[http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2013/01/28/gun-laws-and-the-fools-of-chelm-by-david-mamet.html Gun Laws and the Fools of Chelm].

Mamet is a contributing editor to [[Flying (magazine)|Flying magazine]].

==Critical reception to Mamet==

==="Mamet speak"===

Mamet's style of writing dialogue, marked by a cynical, street-smart edge, precisely crafted for effect, is so distinctive that it has come to be called ''Mamet speak.''<ref>A Companion to Twentieth-century American Drama, David Krasner, Blackwell Publishing, 2005, p. 410</ref> Mamet himself has criticized his (and other writers') tendency to write "pretty" at the expense of sound, logical plots.<ref>{{cite book|title=Writing in Restaurants |url=https://archive.org/details/writinginrestaur00mame |url-access=registration |last=Mamet |first=David|year=1987 |isbn=9780140089813 }}</ref> When asked how he developed his style for writing dialogue, Mamet said, "In my family, in the days prior to television, we liked to while away the evenings by making ourselves miserable, based solely on our ability to speak the language viciously. That's probably where my ability was honed."<ref>{{cite book|title=The Playboy Interviews: The Directors |editor=Stephen Randall |year=2006 |publisher=M Press |page=276 |chapter=David Mamet: April 1996, interviewed by Geoffrey Norman and John Rezek}}</ref>

One instance of Mamet's dialogue style can be found in ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross]]'', in which two down-on-their-luck real estate salesmen are considering stealing from their employer's office. [[Glengarry Glen Ross#Characters|George Aaronow]] and [[Glengarry Glen Ross#Characters|Dave Moss]] equivocate on the meaning of "talk" and "speak", turning language and meaning to deceptive purposes:

:'''Moss''' No. What do you mean? Have I talked to him about ''this'' [Pause]
:'''Aaronow''' Yes. I mean are you actually ''talking'' about this, or are we just...
:'''Moss''' No, we're just...
:'''Aaronow''' We're just ''"talking"'' about it.
:'''Moss''' We're just ''speaking'' about it. [Pause] As an ''idea.''
:'''Aaronow''' As an idea.
:'''Moss''' Yes.
:'''Aaronow''' We're not actually ''talking'' about it.
:'''Moss''' No.
:'''Aaronow''' Talking about it as a...
:'''Moss''' ''No.''
:'''Aaronow''' As a ''robbery.''
:'''Moss''' As a "robbery?" No.

Mamet dedicated ''Glengarry Glen Ross'' to [[Harold Pinter]], who was instrumental in its being first staged at the [[Royal National Theatre]], (London) in 1983, and whom Mamet has acknowledged as an influence on its success, and on his other work.<ref name=NightWaves>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/nightwaves/pip/htjwr/ "Landmarks,"] on ''[[Night Waves]]'' [[BBC Radio]], March 3, 2005, accessed January 17, 2007.</ref>

===Mamet and gender issues===

In his 2014 book ''David Mamet and Male Friendship'', Arthur Holmberg examined Mamet's portrayal of male friendships, especially focusing on the contradictions and ambiguities of [[male bonding]] as dramatized in Mamet's plays and films.<ref>Holmberg, Arthur (2014).
