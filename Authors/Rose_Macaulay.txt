'''Dame Emilie Rose Macaulay''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|DBE}} (1 August 1881 – 30 October 1958) was an English writer, most noted for her award-winning novel ''[[The Towers of Trebizond]]'', about a small [[Anglo-Catholic]] group crossing Turkey by camel. The story is seen as a spiritual autobiography, reflecting her own changing and conflicting beliefs. Macaulay's novels were partly influenced by [[Virginia Woolf]]; she also wrote biographies and travelogues.

==Early years and education==
Macaulay was born in [[Rugby, Warwickshire]] the daughter of [[George Campbell Macaulay]], a [[classical scholar]], and his wife, Grace Mary (née Conybeare). Her father was descended in the [[male-line]] directly from the [[Macaulay family of Lewis]]. She was educated at [[Oxford High School (Oxford)|Oxford High School]] for Girls and read Modern History at [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville College]] at [[Oxford University]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Crawford, Alice|title=Paradise Pursued: The Novels of Rose Macaulay|year=1995|publisher=Farleigh Dickinson University Press|page=17|isbn=9780838635735|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MgiPY8D02r0C&pg=PA17}}</ref>

==Career==
Macaulay began writing her first novel, ''Abbots Verney'' (published 1906), after leaving Somerville and while living with her parents at Ty Isaf, near [[Aberystwyth]], in Wales. Later novels include ''The Lee Shore'' (1912), ''Potterism'' (1920), ''Dangerous Ages'' (1921), ''Told by an Idiot'' (1923), ''And No Man's Wit'' (1940), ''[[The World My Wilderness]]'' (1950), and ''[[The Towers of Trebizond]]'' (1956). Her non-fiction work includes ''They Went to Portugal'', ''Catchwords and Claptrap'', a biography of [[John Milton]], and ''Pleasure of Ruins''. Macaulay's fiction was influenced by Virginia Woolf and [[Anatole France]].<ref name="k&h">[[Stanley J. Kunitz]] and [[Howard Haycraft]], editors; ''Twentieth Century Authors, A Biographical Dictionary of Modern Literature'', (3rd edition). New York, The H. W. Wilson Company, 1950, pp. 865–66.</ref>

During [[World War I]] Macaulay worked in the [[British propaganda during World War I|British Propaganda Department]], after some time as a nurse and later as a civil servant in the [[War Office]]. She pursued a romantic affair with Gerald O'Donovan, a writer and former Jesuit priest, whom she met in 1918; the relationship lasted until his death, in 1942.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/may/31/featuresreviews.guardianreview32?INTCMP=SRCH Profile], guardian.co.uk; 31 May 2003; accessed 25 July 2015.</ref> During the interwar period she was a sponsor of the pacifist [[Peace Pledge Union]]; however she resigned from the PPU and later recanted her pacifism in 1940.<ref>Martin Ceadel, ''Semi-Detached Idealists:The British Peace Movement and International Relations, 1854–1945''. Oxford University Press, 2000; {{ISBN|0199241171}} (p. 361).</ref> Her London flat was destroyed in [[the Blitz]], and she had to rebuild her life and library from scratch, as documented in the semi-autobiographical short story, ''Miss Anstruther's Letters'', which was published in 1942.

''[[The Towers of Trebizond]]'', her final novel, is generally regarded as her masterpiece. Strongly autobiographical, it treats with wistful humour and deep sadness the attractions of [[mysticism|mystical]] Christianity, and the irremediable conflict between adulterous love and the demands of the Christian faith. For this work, she received the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] in 1956.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Personal life==
Macaulay was never a simple believer in "[[mere Christianity]]", and her writings reveal a more complex, mystical sense of the Divine. That said, she did not return to the [[Anglican]] church until 1953; she had been an ardent [[secularism|secularist]] before and, while religious themes pervade her novels, previous to her conversion she often treats Christianity satirically, for instance in ''Going Abroad'' and ''The World My Wilderness''. She never married.

She was created a [[Order of the British Empire|Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (DBE) on 31 December 1957 in the 1958 New Years Honours<ref>[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/41268/supplements/10 ''London Gazette'' notice of Macaulay's damehood]</ref> and died ten months later, on 30 October 1958, aged 77, an active [[feminist]] throughout her life.<ref name="k&h"/>

==Memorable quotes==
*From ''[[The Towers of Trebizond]]'':
<blockquote>Adultery is a meanness and a stealing, a taking away from someone what should be theirs, a great selfishness, and surrounded and guarded by lies lest it should be found out. And out of meanness and selfishness and lying flow love and joy and peace beyond anything that can be imagined.</blockquote>
*First line of ''The Towers of Trebizond'', cited by librarian Nancy Pearl in "Famous First Words: A Librarian Shares Favorite Literary Opening Lines," [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=3894040] hosted by Steve Inskeep on NPR's ''Morning Edition'', 8 September 2004, as an example among "some notable opening lines that have made Pearl's heart pound".
<blockquote>"Take my camel, dear", said my Aunt Dot, as she climbed down from this animal on her return from High Mass.</blockquote>
*From ''Staying with Relations''. Discussing the coat worn by a visitor, a character remarks:
<blockquote>Is [[rabbit fur]] disgusting because it's cheap, or is it cheap because it's disgusting?</blockquote>
