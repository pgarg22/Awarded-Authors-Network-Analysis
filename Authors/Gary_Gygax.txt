'''Ernest Gary Gygax''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|aɪ|ɡ|æ|k|s}} {{respell|GY|gaks}}; July 27, 1938&nbsp;– March 4, 2008)<ref name="D&Dfaq">{{cite web | author1 = Mead, Lawrence | author2 = Malcomson, Ian | url = http://www.wizards.com/dnd/DnDArchives_FAQ.asp | title = Dungeons & Dragons FAQ | year = 2003 | access-date = October 3, 2008 | publisher = [[Wizards of the Coast]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081002132129/http://www.wizards.com/dnd/DnDArchives_FAQ.asp | archive-date = October 2, 2008 | url-status = dead | df = mdy-all }}</ref> was an American [[game designer]] and author best known for co-creating the pioneering [[role-playing game]] ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' (''D&D'') with [[Dave Arneson]].

In the 1960s, Gygax created an organization of wargaming clubs and founded the [[Gen Con]] [[gaming convention]]. In 1971, he helped develop ''[[Chainmail (game)|Chainmail]]'', a miniatures wargame based on [[medieval]] warfare. He co-founded the company [[Tactical Studies Rules]] (TSR, Inc.) with childhood friend [[Don Kaye]] in 1973. The following year, he and Arneson created ''D&D'', which expanded on Gygax's ''Chainmail'' and included elements of the fantasy stories he loved as a child. In the same year, he founded ''[[Dragon (magazine)|The Dragon]]'', a magazine based around the new game. In 1977, Gygax began work on a more comprehensive version of the game, called ''[[Advanced Dungeons & Dragons]]''. Gygax designed numerous manuals for the game system, as well as several pre-packaged [[Adventure (Dungeons & Dragons)|adventures]] called "modules" that gave a person running a ''D&D'' game (the "[[Dungeon Master]]") a rough script and ideas on how to run a particular gaming scenario. In 1983, he worked to license the ''D&D'' product line into the successful [[Dungeons & Dragons (TV series)|''D&D'' cartoon series]].

After leaving TSR in 1986 over issues with its new majority owner, Gygax continued to create role-playing game titles independently, beginning with the multi-genre ''[[Dangerous Journeys]]'' in 1992. He designed another gaming system called ''[[Lejendary Adventure]]'', released in 1999. In 2005, Gygax was involved in the ''[[Castles & Crusades]]'' role-playing game, which was conceived as a hybrid between the third edition of ''D&D'' and the original version of the game conceived by Gygax.

Gygax was married twice and had six children. In 2004, Gygax suffered two strokes and narrowly avoided a subsequent heart attack; he was then diagnosed with an [[abdominal aortic aneurysm]] and died in March 2008.

== Early life and inspiration ==
Gygax was born in Chicago, the son of Almina Emelie "Posey" (Burdick)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://humphrysfamilytree.com/Royal/Larson/Edw3-GaryGygax.pdf|title=Relationship Chart|date=August 7, 2013|website=HumphrysFamilyTree.com}}</ref> and [[Switzerland|Swiss]] immigrant and former [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]] violinist Ernst Gygax.<ref name="TheTimesObit">{{cite news| date = March 6, 2008| title = Gary Gygax| work = [[The Times]]| url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article3491541.ece| access-date = October 7, 2008| location=London| first=Sadie | last=Gray}}</ref><ref name="Sullivan" /> He was named Ernest after his father, but he was commonly known as Gary, the middle name given to him by his mother after the actor [[Gary Cooper]].<ref name="witwer" />{{rp|16}} The family lived on Kenmore Avenue, close enough to [[Wrigley Field]]<ref>{{cite web| title = Gary Gygax: Q & A (Part I, Page 19)| publisher = EN World| date = September 17, 2002| url = http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/22566-q-gary-gygax-part-i-19.html| access-date = May 10, 2010| quote = I was born in Chicago about four blocks from Wrigley Field.| archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/655lZgqsx?url=http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/22566-q-gary-gygax-part-i-19.html| archive-date = January 31, 2012| url-status = dead}}</ref> that he could hear the roar of the crowds watching the [[Chicago Cubs]] play.<ref name="witwer">{{cite book|title=Empire of the Imagination: Gary Gygax and the Birth of Dungeons & Dragons|last=Witwer|first=Michael|date=2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-63286-279-2|location=New York|oclc=908838677}}</ref>{{rp|15}} At age 7, he became a member of a small group of friends who called themselves the "Kenmore Pirates".

In this new setting, Gygax soon made friends with several of his peers, including [[Don Kaye]] and Mary Jo Powell. During his childhood and teen years, he developed a love of games and an appreciation for fantasy and science fiction literature. When he was five, he played card games such as [[pinochle]] and then board games such as [[chess]].<ref name="ts08">{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/2008/11/08/gary_gygax_king_nerd.html|title=Gary Gygax, King Nerd|last=Barmak|first=Sarah|date=November 8, 2008|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|access-date=November 22, 2019|page=ID.2|issn=0319-0781|id={{ProQuest|439502351}}}}</ref><ref name="EconomistObit" /> At the age of ten, he and his friends played the sort of make-believe games that eventually came to be called "[[live action role-playing game]]s" with one of them acting as a referee.<ref name="longbio">Gygax, Gary (2005).

By the time he reached his teens, Gygax had a voracious appetite for [[Pulp magazine|pulp fiction]] authors such as [[Robert E. Howard|Robert Howard]], [[Jack Vance]], [[Fritz Leiber]], [[H. P. Lovecraft]], and [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]].<ref name="witwer" />{{rp|40}} Gygax was a mediocre student, and in 1956, a few months after his father died, he dropped out of high school in his junior year.<ref name="witwer" />{{rp|43}} He joined the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]], but after being diagnosed with [[walking pneumonia]], he received a medical discharge and moved back home with his mother.<ref name="witwer" />{{rp|49}} From there, he commuted to a job as a shipping clerk with [[Kemper Insurance Co.]] in Chicago. Shortly after his return, a friend introduced him to [[Avalon Hill]]'s new wargame ''[[Gettysburg (game)|Gettysburg]].'' Gygax was soon obsessed with the game, often playing marathon sessions once or more a week.<ref>{{Cite book|title=[[The Fantasy Roleplaying Gamer's Bible]]|last=Fannon|first=Sean P.|date=1999|publisher=Obsidian Studios|others=Link, Brett., Acevedo, Aaron., Cummings, Victoria., Fannon, Sean Patrick.|isbn=0-9674429-0-7|edition=2nd|location=Jacksonville|oclc=45357120|author-link=Sean Patrick Fannon}}</ref> It was also from Avalon Hill that he ordered the first blank [[hex map]]ping sheets available, which he then employed to design his own games.<ref name="telegraph">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1580839/Gary-Gygax.html|title=Obituary of Gary Gygax; Godfather of Role-Playing Games and Co-Creator of Dungeons & Dragons|date=March 6, 2008|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=November 22, 2019|location=London|page=25|issn=0307-1235|id={{ProQuest|321557865}}|url-access=registration}}</ref>

About the same time that he discovered ''Gettysburg'', his mother re-introduced him to Mary Jo Powell, who had left Lake Geneva as a child and had just returned. Gygax was smitten with the woman and, after a short courtship, persuaded her to marry him, despite the fact that he was only 19. This caused some friction with his best friend Don Kaye, who had also been wooing Mary Jo. Kaye refused to attend Gygax's wedding.<ref name="witwer" />{{rp|47}} Kaye and Gygax reconciled after the wedding.

The couple moved to Chicago where Gygax continued as a shipping clerk at Kemper Insurance. He found a job for Mary Jo there, but the company laid her off when she became pregnant with their first child.<ref name=witwer />{{rp|53}}  He also took [[anthropology]] classes at the [[University of Chicago]].<ref name="TheTimesObit" /><ref name="Sullivan" />

Despite his commitments to his job, raising a family, school, and his political volunteerism, Gygax continued to play wargames. It reached the point that Mary Jo, pregnant with their second child, believed he was having an affair and confronted him in a friend's basement only to discover him and his friends sitting around a map-covered table.<ref name=witwer />{{rp|55}}

In 1962, Gygax got a job as an insurance underwriter at [[Fireman's Fund Insurance Co.]] His family continued to grow, and after his third child was born, he decided to move his family back to Lake Geneva.<ref name="TheTimesObit" /> Except for a few months he would spend in [[Clinton (town), Rock County, Wisconsin|Clinton, Wisconsin]],<ref>{{cite web | title = Frank Mentzer Q & A, Part 1, Page 25 | publisher = Dragonsfoot | date = September 29, 2004 | url = http://www.dragonsfoot.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=10717&start=360 | access-date = October 5, 2010}}</ref> following his divorce, and his time in Hollywood while he was the head of TSR's entertainment division, Lake Geneva would be his home for the rest of his life.
 
By 1966, Gygax was active in the wargame hobby world and was writing many magazine articles on the subject.<ref name="playingworld" />{{Rp|9–10}} Gygax learned about [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[Little Wars]]'' book for play of military miniatures wargames and [[Fletcher Pratt]]'s ''Naval Wargame'' book. Gygax later looked for innovative ways to generate random numbers, and he used not only common six-sided [[dice]], but dice of all five [[Platonic solid]] shapes,<ref name="Parker2008">{{cite news | last = Parker | first = Laura | date =March 7, 2008 | title = Gary Gygax: Founding father of fantasy computer games and co-creator of Dungeons & Dragons | work = The Guardian | url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/mar/07/games?gusrc=rss&feed=technology | access-date = October 7, 2008}}</ref> which he discovered in a school supply catalog.<ref name="Wired" />

Gygax cited his influences as [[Robert E. Howard]], [[L. Sprague de Camp]], [[Jack Vance]], [[Fletcher Pratt]], [[Fritz Leiber]], [[Poul Anderson]], [[A. Merritt]], and [[H. P. Lovecraft]].<ref>{{cite journal| last = Gygax | first = Gary| year = 1985| title = On the influence of J.R.R.

== Wargames ==
{{Wargaming}}
In 1967, Gygax co-founded the [[International Federation of Wargamers]] (IFW) with Bill Speer and Scott Duncan.<ref name="playingworld" />{{Rp|9–10}} The IFW grew rapidly, particularly by assimilating several pre-existing wargaming clubs, and aimed to promote interest in wargames of all periods. It provided a forum for wargamers, via its newsletters and societies, which enabled them to form local groups and share rules. In 1967, Gygax organized a 20-person gaming meet in the basement of his home; this event would later be referred to as "Gen Con 0".<ref name="Parker2008" /> In 1968, Gygax rented Lake Geneva's vine-covered [[Horticultural Hall, Lake Geneva, Wisconsin|Horticultural Hall]] for {{USD|50}} ({{Inflation|US|50|1968|fmt=eq|r=-1}}){{Inflation/fn|US}} to hold the first Lake Geneva Convention, also known as the [[Gen Con]] [[gaming convention]] for short.<ref name="Wired" /> Gen Con is now one of North America's largest annual hobby-game gatherings.<ref name="Miller2002">{{cite news| last = Miller II| first = Stanley A.| date = August 3, 2002| title = Gen gone: Next year, gamers will be draggin' their tales to Indiana prairie| work = [[Journal Sentinel]]| url = http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=63415| access-date = December 17, 2008|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070809193643/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=63415|archive-date = August 9, 2007}}</ref> Gygax met [[Dave Arneson]], the future co-creator of ''D&D'', at the second Gen Con in August 1969.<ref name="Wired" /><ref name="King & Borland">{{cite book| last1 = King| first1 = Brad| last2 = Borland|first2 = John| year = 2003| title = Dungeons & Dreamers: The Rise of Computer Game Culture from Chic to Geek| publisher = [[McGraw-Hill]]| isbn = 0-07-222888-1}}</ref>

Together with Don Kaye, Mike Reese, and Leon Tucker, Gygax created a military miniatures society called [[Lake Geneva Tactical Studies Association]] (LGTSA) in 1970,<ref name="playingworld">{{cite book|title=Playing at the World|last=Peterson|first=Jon|publisher=Unreason Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0-615-64204-8|location=San Diego|oclc=808727087}}</ref>{{Rp|26}} with its first headquarters in Gygax's basement.<ref name="EconomistObit" /> Shortly thereafter in 1970, Robert Kuntz and Gygax founded the [[Castle & Crusade Society]] of the IFW.<ref name="playingworld" />{{Rp|29}}

Late in October 1970, Gygax lost his job at the insurance company after almost nine years. Unemployed and now with a family of five children—Ernest ("Ernie"), Lucion ("Luke"), Heidi, Cindy, and Elise<ref name="longbio" /><ref name="TheTimesObit" />—he tried to use his enthusiasm for games to make a living by designing board games for commercial sale. This clearly proved to be unsustainable when he only grossed $882 in 1971 ({{Inflation|US|882|1971|fmt=eq}}).<ref name="witwer" />{{rp|84}} He began [[cobbling]] shoes in his basement, which provided him with a steady income and gave him more time for pursuing his interest in game development.<ref name="playingworld" />{{Rp|33}} In 1971, he began doing some editing work at [[Guidon Games]], a publisher of [[wargaming|wargames]],<ref name="longbio" /> for which he produced the board games ''[[Alexander the Great (board game)|Alexander the Great]]'' and ''[[Dunkirk: The Battle of France]]''. Early that same year, Gygax published ''[[Chainmail (game)|Chainmail]]'', a miniatures wargame that simulated medieval-era tactical combat, which he had originally written with hobby-shop owner [[Jeff Perren]].<ref name="Wired" /><ref name="30 Years">{{cite book|last=Winter|first=Steve|title=30 Years of Adventure: A Celebration of Dungeons & Dragons|title-link=30 Years of Adventure: A Celebration of Dungeons & Dragons|date=October 2004|publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]]|isbn=0-7869-3498-0|oclc=56961559|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref name="inc">{{cite web | url=http://www.inc.com/magazine/19820201/3601.html | title=TSR Hobbies Mixes Fact and Fantasy | date=February 1, 1982 | author=Stewart Alsop II}}</ref> The ''Chainmail'' medieval miniatures rules were originally published in the Castle & Crusade Society's fanzine ''The Domesday Book''. Guidon Games hired Gygax to produce a "Wargaming with Miniatures" series of games, and a new edition of ''Chainmail'' (1971) was the first book in the series.<ref name="designers">{{cite book|title=Designers & Dragons|last=Appelcline|first=Shannon|publisher=Mongoose Publishing|year=2011|isbn=978-1-907702-58-7}}</ref>{{rp|6}} The first edition of ''Chainmail'' included a fantasy supplement to the rules.<ref name="inc" /> These comprised a system for warriors, wizards, and various monsters of non-human races drawn from the works of [[J.

Gygax also collaborated on [[Tractics]] with Mike Reese & Leon Tucker, his contribution being the change to a 20-sided spinner or a coffee can with 20 numbered poker chips (or eventually 20-sided dice) to decide combat resolutions instead of the standard 6-sided dice.<ref name="witwer" />{{rp|87}} He also collaborated with Dave Arneson on the Napoleonic naval wargame ''[[Don't Give Up the Ship!]]''<ref name="King & Borland" />

Dave Arneson adapted the ''Chainmail'' rules for his fantasy ''[[Blackmoor (campaign setting)|Blackmoor]]'' campaign.<ref name="Wired" /> {{Disputed inline|for=Arneson and his players said he didn't use Chainmail long in Blackmoor|date=September 2019}} In the fall of 1972, around late November, Dave Arneson and friend [[David Megarry]], inventor of the [[Dungeon!]] board game, traveled to Lake Geneva to showcase their respective games to Gygax, in his role as a representative of Guidon Games.

Two weeks after Arneson's ''Blackmoor'' demonstration, Gygax had produced a 50-page set of rules, and was ready to try it on his two oldest children, Ernie and Elise, in a setting he called "Greyhawk". This group rapidly expanded to include Don Kaye, Rob Kuntz and eventually a large circle of players. Gygax sent the 50 pages of rules to his wargaming contacts and asked them to playtest the new game. Gygax and Arneson continued to trade notes about their respective campaigns. The final draft, however contained changes that were not vetted by Arneson, and Gygax's vision differed on some rule details Arneson had preferred.<ref name=witwer />{{rp|100}}

Based on the feedback he received, Gygax created a 150-page revision of the rules by mid-1973. Several aspects of the system governing magic in the game were inspired by ''[[The Dying Earth]]'' stories of fantasy author [[Jack Vance]] (notably the fact that ''magic-users'' in the game forget the spells that they have learned immediately upon casting them, and must re-study them in order to cast them again), and the system as a whole drew upon the work of authors such as [[Robert E. Howard]], [[L. Sprague de Camp]], [[Michael Moorcock]], [[Roger Zelazny]], [[Poul Anderson]], [[Works inspired by J. R. R.

By 1974, Gygax's Greyhawk group, which had started off with himself, Ernie Gygax, Don Kaye, Rob Kuntz, and [[Terry Kuntz]], had grown to over 20 people, with Rob Kuntz becoming the co-dungeon-master so that each of them could referee groups of only a dozen players.<ref name="designers" />{{rp|7}}

The first commercial version of ''D&D'' was released by TSR in January 1974 as a [[Dungeons & Dragons (1974)|boxed set]].<ref name="GIG">{{cite book|title=The Game Inventor's Guidebook|last=Tinsman|first=Brian|publisher=Krause|year=2002|isbn=0-87349-552-7|location=Iola, Wis.|oclc=52757662}}</ref> Sales of the hand-assembled print run of 1,000 copies, put together in Gygax's home,<ref name="30 Years" /> sold out in less than a year.<ref name="TheTimesObit" /><ref name="Sullivan" /> (In 2018, a first printing of the boxed set sold at auction for more than $20,000.)<ref name=aa />{{rp|424}}

At the end of 1974, with sales of D&D skyrocketing, the future looked bright for Gygax and Kaye, who were only 36. However, in January 1975, Kaye unexpectedly died of a heart attack. He had not made any specific provision in his will regarding his one-third share of the company, simply leaving his entire estate to his wife Donna.<ref name="QnA4"/> Although she had worked briefly for TSR as an accountant, she had not shared her husband's enthusiasm for gaming, and made it clear that she would not be having anything to do with managing the company. Gygax characterized her as "less than personable... After Don died she dumped all the Tactical Studies Rules materials off on my front porch. It would have been impossible to manage a business with her involved as a partner."<ref name="QnA4">{{cite web|url=http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/57832-gary-gygax-q-part-iv-2.html|title=Gary Gygax: Q & A (Part IV, Page 2)|date=July 23, 2003|publisher=EN World|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207153539/http://www.enworld.org/forum/showthread.php?57832-Gary-Gygax-Q-amp-A-Part-IV%2Fpage2|archive-date=December 7, 2014|access-date=March 23, 2010}}</ref> After Kaye's death, TSR was forced to relocate from Kaye's dining room to Gygax's basement.<ref name="designers" />{{rp|7}} In July 1975, Gygax and Blume reorganized their company from a partnership to a corporation called TSR Hobbies. Gygax owned 150 shares, Blume owned the other 100 shares, and both had the option to buy up to 700 shares at any time in the future. But TSR Hobbies had nothing to publish—D&D was still owned by the three-way partnership of TSR, and neither Gygax nor Blume had the money to buy out the shares owned by Kaye's wife. Blume persuaded a reluctant Gygax to allow his father, Melvin Blume, to buy Donna's shares, and those were converted to 200 shares in TSR Hobbies.<ref name="uiwgg">{{cite web|url=http://www.thekyngdoms.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=37|title=The Ultimate Interview with Gary Gygax|website=The Kyngdoms|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404124008/http://www.thekyngdoms.com/interviews/garygygax.php|archive-date=April 4, 2016|url-status=dead|access-date=June 7, 2016}}</ref> In addition, Brian bought another 140 shares.<ref name=witwer />{{rp|117}} These purchases reduced Gygax from the majority shareholder in control of the company to minority shareholder; he effectively became the Blumes' employee.<ref name="designers" />{{rp|8}}

Gygax wrote the supplements ''[[Greyhawk (supplement)|Greyhawk]]'', ''[[Eldritch Wizardry]]'', and ''[[Swords & Spells]]'' for the original ''D&D game''. With Brian Blume, Gygax also designed the [[Western (genre)|wild west]]-oriented role-playing game ''[[Boot Hill (role-playing game)|Boot Hill]]''. In the same year, Gygax created the magazine ''[[The Strategic Review]]'' with himself as editor.<ref name="longbio" /> But wanting a more industry-wide periodical, he hired [[Tim Kask]] as TSR's first employee to change this magazine to the fantasy periodical ''[[Dragon (magazine)|The Dragon]]'',<ref name="Parker2008" /> with Gygax as writer, columnist, and publisher (from 1978 to 1981).<ref>{{cite journal|date=April 1978 – April 1981|title=Dragon Rumbles|journal=[[Dragon (magazine)|The Dragon]]|location=Lake Geneva|publisher=[[TSR, Inc.|TSR Hobbies]]|volume=II-V|issue=13–24, 26–48}}</ref> ''The Dragon'' debuted in June 1976, and Gygax commented on its success years later: "When I decided that ''The Strategic Review'' was not the right vehicle, hired Tim Kask as a magazine editor for Tactical Studies Rules, and named the new publication he was to produce ''The Dragon'', I thought we would eventually have a great periodical to serve gaming enthusiasts worldwide&nbsp;... At no time did I ever contemplate so great a success or so long a lifespan."<ref name="Dragon #248" />

In 1976, TSR moved out of Gygax's house into its first professional home, known as "The Dungeon Hobby Shop".<ref name="designers" />{{rp|8}} Dave Arneson was hired as part of the creative staff, but was let go after only ten months, another sign that Gygax and Arneson still had creative differences over D&D.<ref name=witwer />{{rp|129}}

=== ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' and Hollywood===
The ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set]]'', released in 1977, was an introductory version of the original ''D&D'' geared towards new players and edited by [[John Eric Holmes|J. Eric Holmes]].<ref name="30 Years" /> In the same year, TSR Hobbies released a completely new and complex version of ''D&D'', ''[[Advanced Dungeons & Dragons]]'' (''AD&D''). The ''[[Monster Manual]]'', released later that year, became the first supplemental rule book of the new system, and many more followed.<ref name="history" /> The ''AD&D'' rules were not fully compatible with those of the ''D&D Basic Set'' and as a result, ''D&D'' and ''AD&D'' became distinct product lines.<ref name=witwer />{{rp|135}} Splitting the game lines created a further rift between Gygax and Arneson; although Arneson received a 10% royalty on sales of all ''D&D'' products, Gygax refused to pay him royalties on ''AD&D'' books, claiming it was a new and different property. In 1979, Arneson filed a lawsuit against TSR; it was eventually settled in March 1981 with the agreement that Arneson would receive a 2.5% royalty on all AD&D products, giving him a very comfortable six-figure annual income for the next decade.<ref name="witwer" />{{rp|139}}

Gygax wrote the ''AD&D'' hardcovers ''[[Players Handbook]]'', ''[[Dungeon Masters Guide]]'',<!-- (sic) – no apostrophes --> ''Monster Manual,'' and ''[[Monster Manual II]]''. Gygax also wrote or co-wrote numerous ''AD&D'' and basic ''D&D'' [[Adventure (Dungeons & Dragons)|adventure modules]], including ''[[The Keep on the Borderlands]]'', ''[[Tomb of Horrors]]'', ''[[Expedition to the Barrier Peaks]]'', ''[[The Temple of Elemental Evil]]'', ''[[The Forgotten Temple of Tharizdun]]'', ''[[Mordenkainen's Fantastic Adventure]]'', ''[[Isle of the Ape]]'', and all seven of the modules later combined into ''[[Queen of the Spiders]]''. In 1980, Gygax's long-time campaign setting of [[Greyhawk]] was published in the form of the ''[[World of Greyhawk Fantasy World Setting]]'' folio, which was expanded in 1983 into the ''[[World of Greyhawk Fantasy Game Setting]]'' boxed set. Sales of the ''D&D'' game reached {{USD|8.5 million}} in 1980.<ref name="TheTimesObit" /> Gygax also provided assistance on the ''[[Gamma World]]'' science fantasy role-playing game in 1981 and co-authored the ''Gamma World'' adventure ''[[Legion of Gold]]''.

In 1979, a [[Michigan State University]] student, [[James Dallas Egbert III]], allegedly disappeared into the school's steam tunnels while playing a live-action version of ''D&D''. In fact, Egbert was discovered in Louisiana several weeks later,<ref name=witwer />{{rp|145}} but negative mainstream media attention focused on ''D&D'' as the cause. In 1982, [[Patricia Pulling]]'s son killed himself. Blaming ''D&D'' for her son's suicide, Pulling formed an organization named B.A.D.D. (Bothered About Dungeons & Dragons) to attack the game and the company that produced it. Gygax defended the game on a segment of ''[[60 Minutes]]'',<ref name="Sullivan" /><ref>{{Citation|last=Bob Blahloblaw|title=60 Minutes on Dungeons and Dragons|date=April 22, 2015|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN_nuxOhT2s| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323024216/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN_nuxOhT2s&gl=US&hl=en| archive-date=2016-03-23 | url-status=dead|access-date=August 12, 2016}}</ref> which aired in 1985. When death threats started arriving at the TSR office, Gygax hired a bodyguard.<ref name="TheTimesObit" /><ref name="Wired" /> Despite the negative publicity, or perhaps because of it, TSR's annual ''D&D'' sales increased in 1982 to {{USD|16 million}},<ref name="Wired" /> and in January 1983, ''[[The New York Times]]'' speculated that ''D&D'' might become "the great game of the 1980s" in the same manner that ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'' was emblematic of the [[Great Depression]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/19/opinion/topics-updates-playing-games.html|title=Topics; Updates; Playing Games; [Editorial]|date=January 19, 1983|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|page=A.22|issn=0362-4331|id={{ProQuest|424534874}}|url-access=registration}}</ref>

Brian Blume persuaded Gygax to allow Brian's brother Kevin to purchase Melvin Blume's shares. This gave the Blume brothers a controlling interest,<ref name="uiwgg" /> and by 1981, Gygax and the Blumes were increasingly at loggerheads over management of the company. Gygax's frustrations at work, and increased prosperity from his generous royalty cheques, brought a number of changes to his personal life. He and Mary Jo had been active members of the local [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], but others in the congregation already felt uneasy about Gygax's smoking and drinking; his connection to the "satanic" game of D&D caused enough friction that the Gygaxes finally disassociated themselves from Jehovah's Witnesses.<ref name=witwer />{{rp|156}} Mary Jo, continuing to resent the amount of time her husband spent "playing games", had begun to drink excessively, and the couple argued frequently. Gygax, who had started smoking marijuana when he lost his insurance job in 1970, started to use [[cocaine]], and had a number of extramarital affairs. Finally in 1983, the two had an acrimonious divorce.<ref name=witwer />{{rp|187}}

At the same time, the Blumes, wanting to get Gygax out of Lake Geneva so they could manage the company without his "interference", split TSR Hobbies into TSR, Inc., and TSR Entertainment, Inc. Gygax became the President of TSR Entertainment, Inc.,<ref name="Dragon #103" /> and the Blumes sent him to Hollywood to develop TV and movie opportunities.<ref name="designers" />{{rp|13}} He became co-producer of the licensed [[Dungeons & Dragons (TV series)|''D&D'' cartoon series]] for [[CBS]],<ref name="gamespy2.1" /> which led its time slot for two years.<ref name="D&Dfaq" />

Gygax, newly single, took advantage of his time on the West Coast, renting an immense mansion, increasing his cocaine use, and spending time with several young starlets.<ref name=witwer />{{rp|168}}

=== Leaving TSR ===
Because he was occupied with getting a movie off the ground in Hollywood, Gygax had to leave the day-to-day operations of TSR to Kevin and Brian Blume.<ref name="Wired" /> In 1984, after months of negotiation, he reached an agreement with [[Orson Welles]] to star in a D&D movie, and [[John Boorman]] to act as producer and director. But almost at the same time, he received word that back in Lake Geneva, TSR had run into severe financial difficulties and Kevin Blume was shopping the company for {{USD|6 million}}.<ref name=witwer />{{rp|171}}

Gygax immediately discarded his movie ambitions—his ''D&D'' movie would never be made—and flew back to Lake Geneva. There, he discovered to his shock that although industry leader TSR was grossing {{USD|30 million}}, it was barely breaking even;<ref name=witwer />{{rp|171}} it was in fact {{USD|1.5 million}} in debt and teetering on the edge of insolvency.<ref name="Wired" /> After investigating the reasons why, Gygax brought his findings to the five other company directors. (Since 1982, TSR, Inc. had conformed to the recommendations of the [[American Management Association]] by adding three "outside" directors to the board, increasing its size to six.) Gygax charged that the financial crisis was due to mismanagement by Kevin Blume: excess inventory, overstaffing, too many company cars, and some questionable (and expensive) projects such as dredging up a 19th century shipwreck.<ref name=witwer />{{rp|172}} Gygax demanded that Kevin Blume be removed as company president, and the three outside directors agreed with him. However, the board still believed the financial problems were terminal and the company needed to be sold. In an effort to stay in control, in March 1985, Gygax exercised his 700-share stock option, giving him just over 50% control. He appointed himself president and CEO, and rather than selling the company, he took steps to produce new revenue-generating products. To that end, he contacted Dave Arneson with a view to produce some Blackmoor material. He also bet heavily on a new AD&D book, ''[[Unearthed Arcana]]'', a compilation of material culled from ''Dragon'' magazine articles. And he quickly wrote a novel set in his Greyhawk setting, ''[[Saga of Old City]]'', featuring a protagonist called Gord the Rogue. In order to bring some financial stability to TSR, he hired a company manager, [[Lorraine Williams]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

When ''Unearthed Arcana'' was released in July, Gygax's bet paid off, as the new book sold 90,000 copies in the first month. His novel also sold well, and he immediately published a sequel, ''[[Artifact of Evil]]''. The financial crisis had been averted, but Gygax had paved the way for his own downfall. In October 1985, the new manager, Lorraine Williams, revealed that she had purchased all of the shares of Kevin and Brian Blume—after Brian had triggered his own 700-share option. Williams was now the majority shareholder, and replaced Gygax as president and CEO. She also made it clear that Gygax would be making no further creative contributions to TSR. Several of his projects were immediately shelved and never published. Gygax took TSR to court in a bid to block the Blumes' sale of their shares to Williams, but he lost.<ref name="Dragon122">Gygax, Gary 1987.

Sales of ''D&D'' reached {{USD|29 million}} in 1985,<ref name="TheTimesObit" /> but Gygax, seeing his future at TSR as untenable,<ref name="gamespy2.1">{{cite web|url=http://pc.gamespy.com/articles/538/538820p1.html|title=Gary Gygax Interview – Part 2 (page 1)|access-date=October 3, 2008|date=August 16, 2004 |last=Rausch|first=Allen|work=[[GameSpy]]|publisher=IGN Entertainment|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917181104/http://pc.gamespy.com/articles/538/538820p1.html |archive-date=September 17, 2008 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> resigned all positions with TSR, Inc. in October 1986, and settled his disputes with TSR in December 1986.<ref name="Dragon122" /> By the terms of his settlement with TSR, Gygax kept the rights to Gord the Rogue as well as all ''D&D'' characters whose names were anagrams or plays on his own name (for example, Yrag and Zagyg).<ref>{{cite web | title = Gary Gygax: Q & A (Part IX, Page 91) | publisher = EN World | date = October 20, 2005 | url = http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/125997-gary-gygax-q-part-ix-91.html | access-date = March 15, 2009 | quote = Anagrams of my name are exclusively my property according to my settlement agreement with TSR, so that is how I can use Zagyg, or Zagig, as well as Yrag. | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120319233434/http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/125997-gary-gygax-q-part-ix-91.html | archive-date = March 19, 2012 | url-status = dead }}</ref> However, he lost the rights to all his other work, including the ''World of Greyhawk'' and the names of all the characters he had ever used in TSR material, such as [[Mordenkainen]], [[Robilar]], and [[Tenser]].

== After TSR ==

=== 1985–1989: New Infinities Productions, Inc. ===
Immediately after leaving TSR, Gygax was approached by a wargaming acquaintance, Forrest Baker, who had done some consulting work for TSR in 1983 and 1984.<ref name=witwer />{{rp|188}} Gygax, who was tired of company management, was simply looking for some way to market more of his Gord the Rogue novels, but Baker had a vision for a new gaming company. He promised that he would handle the business end, while Gygax would handle the creative projects. Baker also guaranteed that, using Gygax's name, he would be able to bring in one to two million dollars of investment.<ref name=witwer />{{rp|188}} Gygax decided this was a good opportunity, and in October 1986, [[New Infinities Productions]], Inc. (NIPI)<ref>{{cite news | title = It's Only a Fad| last = Cobb| first = Nathan| date = April 19, 1987| newspaper = [[The Boston Globe]]| page = 77 | issn = 0743-1791| id = {{ProQuest|294411624}}}} (Registration required)</ref><ref name="designers" /> was publicly announced.<ref name="designers" />{{rp|237}} To help him with the creative work, Gygax poached [[Frank Mentzer]] and ''Dragon'' magazine editor [[Kim Mohan]] from TSR.<ref name="Dragon122" /> But before a single product was released, Forrest Baker left NIPI when his promised outside investment of one to two million dollars failed to materialize.<ref name="designers" />{{rp|237}}

Against his will, Gygax was back in charge again; he immediately looked for a quick product to get NIPI off the ground. He had retained the rights to Gord the Rogue as part of his severance agreement with TSR, so he licensed Greyhawk from TSR and started writing new novels beginning with ''Sea of Death'' (1987); sales were brisk, and Gygax's Gord the Rogue novels ended up keeping New Infinities in business.<ref name="designers" />{{rp|237}}

Gygax brought in [[Don Turnbull (game designer)|Don Turnbull]] from [[Games Workshop]] to manage the company, then worked with Mohan and Mentzer on a science fiction-themed RPG, ''[[Cyborg Commando]]'', which was published in 1987.<ref name="designers" />{{rp|237}} However, sales of the new game were not brisk: the game received overwhelmingly negative reception. NIPI was still dependent on Gord the Rogue.

Mentzer and Mohan also wrote a series of generic RPG adventures called ''Gary Gygax Presents Fantasy Master''. They also began working on a third line of products, which began with an adventure written by Mentzer called ''The Convert'' (1987); Mentzer had written the adventure as an RPGA tournament for ''D&D'', but TSR was not interested in publishing it. Mentzer got verbal permission to publish it with New Infinities, but since the permission was not in writing TSR filed an injunction to prevent the adventure's sale, although the injunction was later lifted.<ref name="designers"/>{{rp|238}}<ref name=witwer />{{rp|190}} The legal costs further drained NIPI of capital.

During all of this drama, Gygax became a father again. Over the past year, he had formed a romantic relationship with Gail Carpenter, his former assistant at TSR. In November 1986, she gave birth to Gygax's sixth child, Alex. Biographer Michael Witwer believes the birth of Alex forced Gygax to reconsider the equation of work, gaming and family that, up until this time, had been dominated by work and gaming. "Gary, keenly aware that he had made mistakes as a father and husband in the past, was determined not to make them again&nbsp;... Gary was also a realist, and knew what good fatherhood would demand, especially at his age."<ref name=witwer />{{rp|189}} On August 15, 1987, on what would have been his parents' 50th wedding anniversary, Gygax married Gail Carpenter.<ref name="telegraph" />

During 1987 and 1988, Gygax worked with [[Flint Dille]] on the ''[[Sagard the Barbarian]]'' books,<ref name="Sullivan" /> as well as ''[[Role-Playing Mastery]]'' and its sequel, ''Master of the Game''.<ref name=witwer />{{rp|191}} He also wrote two more Gord the Rogue novels, ''City of Hawks'' (1987), and ''Come Endless Darkness'' (1988). However, by 1988, TSR had rewritten the setting for the world of Greyhawk, and Gygax was not happy with the new direction in which TSR was taking "his" creation. In a literary declaration that his old world was dead, and wanting to make a clean break with all things Greyhawk, Gygax destroyed his version of [[Oerth]] in the final Gord the Rogue novel, ''Dance of Demons''.<ref>Q: "After you left TSR, you finished the Gord the Rogue books. At the end of the cycle, Oerth bites the bullet. Was this your way of saying that Greyhawk is dead and that fans should turn away from TSR's version with disdain?" Gygax: "More my way of saying that since T$R had killed the setting with trash releases, it was time to wipe out the shame by obliterating the setting."{{cite web| title = Gary Gygax: Q & A (Part VII, page 2)| publisher = EN World| date = November 19, 2004| url = http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/104817-gary-gygax-q-part-vii-2.html| access-date = March 15, 2009| archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/655liQFuO?url=http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/104817-gary-gygax-q-part-vii-2.html| archive-date = January 31, 2012| url-status = dead}}</ref>

With the Gord the Rogue novels finished, NIPI's main source of steady income dried up. The company needed a new product. Gygax announced in 1988 in a company newsletter that he and Rob Kuntz, his co-Dungeon Master during the early days of the Greyhawk campaign, were working as a team again. This time they would create a new multi-genre fantasy RPG called "Infinite Adventures", which would be supported by different gamebooks for different genres.<ref name="designers" />{{rp|61}} This line would detail the Castle and City of Greyhawk as Gygax and Kuntz had originally envisioned them, now called "Castle Dunfalcon".<ref name="designers" />{{rp|239}}

However, before work on this project could commence, NIPI ran out of money, was forced into bankruptcy, and was dissolved in 1989.<ref name="designers" />{{rp|239}}

=== 1990–1994: ''Dangerous Journeys'' ===
After NIPI folded, Gygax decided to create an entirely new RPG called ''The Carpenter Project'',<ref name="designers" />{{rp|61}} one considerably more complex and "rule heavy" than his original and relatively simple ''D&D'' system, which had been encompassed by a mere 150 typewritten pages.<ref name=witwer />{{rp|194}} He also wanted to create a horror setting for the new RPG called ''Unhallowed''. He began working on the RPG and the setting with the help of games designer Mike McCulley.<ref name=witwer />{{rp|193}} [[Game Designers' Workshop]] became interested in publishing the new system, and it also drew the attention of [[JVC]] and [[NEC]], who were looking for a new RPG system and setting to turn into a series of computer games.<ref name=witwer />{{rp|194}} NEC and JVC were not interested in horror though, and work on the ''Unhallowed'' setting was shelved in favour of a fantasy setting called ''Mythus''. JVC also wanted a name change for the RPG, favoring ''Dangerous Dimensions'' over ''The Carpenter Project''.<ref name="designers" />{{rp|61–62}} Work progressed favourably until March 1992, when TSR filed an injunction against ''Dangerous Dimensions'', claiming the name and initials were too similar to ''Dungeons & Dragons''. Gygax, with the approval of NEC and JVC, quickly changed the name to ''Dangerous Journeys'',<ref name="Kyngdoms">{{cite web | last = Sacco | first = Ciro Alessandro | title = The Ultimate Interview with Gary Gygax | work = thekyngdoms.com | url = http://www.thekyngdoms.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=37 | access-date = October 24, 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111223222505/http://www.thekyngdoms.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=37 | archive-date = December 23, 2011 | url-status = dead | df = mdy-all }}</ref> and work on the new game continued.

The marketing strategy for ''Dangerous Journeys: Mythus'' was multi-pronged: in addition to the RPG and setting to be published by Game Designers' Workshop, and the ''Mythus'' computer game being prepared by NEC and JVC, there would also be a series of books based on the Mythus setting written by Gygax. So in addition to his work on the RPG and the ''Mythus'' setting, Gygax wrote three novels, released under publisher [[Penguin Books|Penguin/Roc]] and later reprinted by [[Paizo Publishing]]: ''The Anubis Murders'', ''The Samarkand Solution'', and ''Death in Delhi''.

In late 1992, the ''Dangerous Journeys'' RPG was released by Game Designers' Workshop,<ref name="Sullivan">{{cite news| last = Sullivan | first = Patricia| date = March 5, 2008| title = E.

Although the injunction failed, TSR moved forward with litigation.

In the end, TSR paid Gygax for the complete rights to ''Dangerous Journeys'' and ''Mythus''.<ref>Gygax: "When the new [fantasy roleplaying game] was introduced at the GTS, a lawsuit was filed by TSR, they claiming it violated the copyright of AD&D. Quite a stretch that, but only a judge intimately familiar with RPGs would know that and dismiss it. So what followed was a long period of discovery and depositions that ran up a huge lawyers' bill—far more on the TSR end than on ours, four to one is likely. Eventually the suit was settled. TSR paid us a very large sum and they got all the rights to the DJ system and Mythus. I suggested to TSR (Lorraine Williams) that the next time I wrote a new RPG they just offer me {{USD|1 million}} for the rights to it, thus saving at least that much money."{{cite web | title = Gary Gygax: Q & A (Part V, Page 4) | publisher = EN World | date = January 4, 2004 | url = http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/71486-gary-gygax-q-part-v-4.html | access-date = May 12, 2010 | archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/655lh7lRX?url=http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/71486-gary-gygax-q-part-v-4.html | archive-date = January 31, 2012 | url-status = dead }}</ref> Although Gygax was well compensated for his years of work on ''Dangerous Journeys'' and ''Mythus'', TSR immediately and permanently shelved them both.

=== 1995–2000: ''Lejendary Adventures'' ===
[[File:Gary Gyax - ModCon 1999 - 1.jpg|thumb|left|Gary Gygax at ModCon Game Fair in 1999, [[:it:Modena|Modena]], [[:it:Italy|Italy]]. His t-shirt advertises the third edition of ''D&D'', which was to be released the following year.]]
In 1995, Gygax began work on a new computer role-playing game called ''[[Lejendary Adventures]]''.<ref name="Parker2008" /> In contrast to the rules-heavy ''Dangerous Journeys'', this new system was a return to simple and basic rules. Although he was not able to successfully release a ''Lejendary Adventures'' computer game, Gygax decided to instead publish it as a tabletop game.<ref name="designers" />{{rp|380}}

Meanwhile, in 1996 the games industry was rocked by the news that TSR had run into insoluble financial problems and had been bought by [[Wizards of the Coast]]. While WotC was busy refocussing TSR's products, Christopher Clark of Inner City Games Designs approached Gygax in 1997 to suggest that they produce some adventures to sell in game stores while TSR was otherwise occupied; the result was a pair of fantasy adventures published by Inner City Games: ''A Challenge of Arms'' (1998) and ''The Ritual of the Golden Eyes'' (1999).<ref name="designers" />{{rp|380}} Gygax introduced some investors to Clark's publication setup, and although the investors were not willing to fund publication of ''Legendary Adventures'', Clark and Gygax formed a partnership called Hekaforge Productions.<ref name="designers" />{{rp|380}} Gygax was thus able to return to publish ''Lejendary Adventures'' in 1999.<ref name="Sullivan" /> The game was published as a three-volume set: ''The Lejendary Rules for All Players'' (1999), ''Lejend Master's Lore'' (2000) and ''Beasts of Lejend'' (2000).<ref name="designers" />{{rp|380}}

The new owner of TSR, WotC's [[Peter Adkison]], clearly did not harbor any of Lorraine Williams' ill-will toward Gygax: Adkison purchased all of Gygax's residual rights to D&D and AD&D for a six-figure sum.<ref name=witwer />{{rp|203}} Although Gygax did not write any new supplements or books for TSR or WotC, he did agree to write the preface to the 1998 adventure ''[[Return to the Tomb of Horrors]]'', a paean to Gygax's original AD&D adventure ''[[Tomb of Horrors]]''.<ref name="Dragon #248">{{cite journal| last = Varney| first = Allen| author-link = Allen Varney| title = Profiles: Gary Gygax| journal = [[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]| issue = #248| page = 120| publisher = [[Wizards of the Coast]]| location = [[Renton, Washington]]|date=June 1998}}</ref> He also returned to the pages of Dragon Magazine, writing the "Up on a Soapbox" column from Issue #268 (January 2000) to Issue #320 (June 2004).<ref name="designers" />{{rp|282}}

=== 2000–2008: Later works and death===

Gygax continued to work on ''Lejendary Adventures'' which he believed was his best work. However, sales were below expectation.<ref name=witwer />{{rp|204}}

On June 11, 2001, [[Stephen Chenault]] and [[Davis Chenault]] of [[Troll Lord Games]] announced that Gygax would be writing books for their company.<ref name="designers" />{{rp|378}} Gygax's early work for Troll Lord included a series of hardcover books that eventually came to be called "Gygaxian Fantasy Worlds"; the first was ''The Canting Crew'' (2002), a look at the roguish underworld. He also wrote ''World Builder'' (2003) and ''Living Fantasy'' (2003), generic game design books usable in many different settings. After the first four books in the series, Gygax stepped down from writing and took on an advisory role, though the series logo still carried his name.<ref name="designers" />{{rp|379}} Troll Lord also published a few adventures as a result of their partnership with Gygax, including ''The Hermit'' (2002) an adventure intended for d20 and also for ''Lejendary Adventures''.<ref name="designers" />{{rp|379}}

By 2002, Gygax had given Christopher Clark of Hekaforge an encyclopaedic 72,000-word text describing the Lejendary Earth. Clark split the manuscript up into five books and expanded it, with each of the final books coming to about 128,000 words, giving Hekaforge a third Lejendary Adventures line to supplement the core rules and adventures. Hekaforge managed to publish the first two of those Lejendary Earth sourcebooks, ''Gazetteer'' (2002) and ''Noble Kings and Great Lands'' (2003),<ref name="designers" />{{rp|380}} but by 2003 the small company was having financial difficulties. Clark had to ask Troll Lord Games to become an "angel" investor by publishing the three remaining ''Lejendary Adventures'' books.<ref name="designers" />{{rp|381}}

On October 9, 2001, [[Necromancer Games]] announced that they would be publishing a [[d20 System|d20]] version of ''Necropolis'', an adventure originally planned by Gygax for New Infinities Productions and later printed in 1992 as a ''Mythus'' adventure by GDW; ''Gary Gygax's Necropolis'' was published a year later.<ref name="designers" />{{rp|366–367}}

Gygax also performed [[Voice acting|voiceover narration]] for cartoons and video games. In 2000, he voiced his own cartoon self for an episode of [[Futurama]], "[[Anthology of Interest I]]"<ref name="TheTimesObit" /><ref name=":0">{{cite episode| title = Anthology of Interest I| episode-link = Anthology of Interest I| series = Futurama| series-link = Futurama| credits = Writers: Rogers, Eric; Keeler, Ken; Cohen, David X.

[[File:Gary Gygax and Stephen Chenault at Gen Con 2003.jpg|thumb|right|Gary Gygax at [[Gen Con]] in 2003. He is sitting in the [[Troll Lord Games]] booth with [[Stephen Chenault]].]] During his time with TSR, Gygax had often mentioned the mysterious Castle Greyhawk which formed the centre of his own home campaign. But despite all of his written output over the previous 30 years, Gygax had never published details of the castle. In 2003, Gygax announced that he was again partnering with [[Robert J. Kuntz|Rob Kuntz]] to publish the original and previously unpublished details of [[Castle Greyhawk]] and the [[City of Greyhawk]] in 6 volumes, although the project would use the rules for ''[[Castles and Crusades]]'' rather than ''D&D''. As Gygax wrote in an on-line forum: 
{{blockquote|I have laid out a new schematic of castle and dungeon levels based on both my original design of 13 levels plus side adjuncts, and the 'New Greyhawk Castle' that resulted when Rob and I combined our efforts and added a lot of new levels too. From that Rob will draft the level plans for the newest version of the work. Meantime, I am collecting all the most salient feature, encounters, tricks, traps, etc. for inclusion on the various levels. So the end result will be what is essentially the best of our old work in a coherent presentation usable by all DMs, the material having all the known and yet to be discussed features of the original work that are outstanding&nbsp;... I hope."<ref>{{cite web | title = Gary Gygax: Q & A (Part IX, page 81) | publisher = EN World | date = December 15, 2005 | url = http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/125997-gary-gygax-q-part-ix-81.html | access-date = March 15, 2009 | archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/655ljs69H?url=http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/125997-gary-gygax-q-part-ix-81.html | archive-date = January 31, 2012 | url-status = dead }}</ref>}}
Since [[Wizards of the Coast]], which had bought TSR in 1997, still owned the rights to the name "Greyhawk", Gygax changed the name of Castle Greyhawk to "Castle Zagyg", a reverse homophone of his own name, and also changed the name of the nearby city to "Yggsburgh", a play on his initials "E.G.G."<ref name=witwer />{{rp|208}}

The scale of the project was enormous: By the time Gygax and Kuntz had stopped working on their original home campaign, the castle dungeons had encompassed 50 levels of cunningly complex passages with thousands of rooms and traps. This, plus plans for the city of Yggsburgh and encounter areas outside the castle and city, would clearly be too much to fit into the proposed 6 volumes. Gygax decided he would compress the castle dungeons into 13 levels, the size of his original Castle Greyhawk in 1973<ref>Gygax: "The whole of the combined material Rob and I put together would be far too large for publication, 50 levels or so. What I have done is gone back to my original design of more modest scope, because I doubt the work will need to accommodate groups of 20 PCs delving on a daily basis."{{cite web | title = Gary Gygax: Q & A (Part IV, Page 9) | publisher = EN World | date = November 2, 2003 | url = http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/57832-gary-gygax-q-part-iv-9.html | access-date = March 15, 2009 | archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/655lkxttI?url=http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/57832-gary-gygax-q-part-iv-9.html | archive-date = January 31, 2012 | url-status = dead }}</ref> by amalgamating the best of what could be gleaned from binders and boxes of old notes.<ref>Gygax: "... the original upper and lower parts of Castle Greyhawk changed many times over the years they were in active use.

Because they had often made up details of play sessions on the spot,<ref>Gygax: "I did indeed create details for the PC party on the spot, adding whatever seemed appropriate, and as Rob played and learned from me, he did the same, and when we were actively co-DMing we could often create some really exciting material on the spot, if you will."{{cite web | title = Gary Gygax: Q & A (Part IX, page 81) | publisher = EN World | date = December 15, 2005 | url = http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/125997-gary-gygax-q-part-ix-81.html | access-date = March 15, 2009 | archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/655ljs69H?url=http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/125997-gary-gygax-q-part-ix-81.html | archive-date = January 31, 2012 | url-status = dead }}</ref> they usually just scribbled a quick map as they played, with cursory notes about monsters, treasures, and traps.<ref>Gygax: "As Rob learned from me, he too DMed by the proverbial seat of the pants method. A single line of notes for an encounter was sufficient for either of us to detail a lengthy description, action, dialog, tricks or traps, and all the rest."{{cite web | title = Gary Gygax: Q & A (Part IV, Page 9) | publisher = EN World | date = November 2, 2003 | url = http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/57832-gary-gygax-q-part-iv-9.html | access-date = March 15, 2009 | archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/655lkxttI?url=http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/57832-gary-gygax-q-part-iv-9.html | archive-date = January 31, 2012 | url-status = dead }}</ref> These sketchy maps had contained just enough detail that the two could ensure their independent work would dovetail. All of these old notes now had to be deciphered, 25-year-old memories dredged up as to what had happened in each room, and a decision made whether to keep or discard each new piece.<ref>Gygax: "What our challenge is going to be is to cull the extraneous, take the best, and re-create the details we made up on the spot. Of course the most famous things will be there, along with most of the best parts that are not well-known through story and word of mouth."{{cite web | title = Gary Gygax: Q & A (Part IV, Page 9) | publisher = EN World | date = November 2, 2003 | url = http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/57832-gary-gygax-q-part-iv-9.html | access-date = March 15, 2009 | archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/655lkxttI?url=http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/57832-gary-gygax-q-part-iv-9.html | archive-date = January 31, 2012 | url-status = dead }}</ref> Recreating the city too would be a challenge. Although Gygax still had his old maps of the original city, all of his previously published work on the city was owned by WotC, so he would have to create most of the city from scratch while still maintaining the "look and feel" of his original.<ref>Gygax: "Yggsburgh was a pain in the rump to write because I wanted to include as much detail as possible for the GM interested in using it as a campaign base. So there are sections on history, costume, monetary system and economy of the area, and complete descriptions of the town, its main locations, and the outstanding geographical areas all with encounters or suggestions for same."{{cite web| title = Gary Gygax: Q & A (Part VII, Page 23)| publisher = EN World| date = February 18, 2005| url = http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/104817-gary-gygax-q-part-vii-23.html| access-date = March 15, 2009| archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/655lm8yBG?url=http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/104817-gary-gygax-q-part-vii-23.html| archive-date = January 31, 2012| url-status = dead}}</ref>

Due to creative differences, Kuntz backed out of the project, but created an adventure module that would be published at the same time as Gygax's first book.<ref>Gygax: "Rob has finished his add on module, but I have not been up to doing the work needed to create the upper works of the castle proper, let alone the dungeon levels below them."{{cite web| title = Gary Gygax: Q & A (Part VII, Page 23)| publisher = EN World| date = February 18, 2005| url = http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/104817-gary-gygax-q-part-vii-23.html| access-date = March 15, 2009| archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/655lm8yBG?url=http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/104817-gary-gygax-q-part-vii-23.html| archive-date = January 31, 2012| url-status = dead}}</ref> Gygax continued to painstakingly put Castle Zagyg together on his own, but even this slow and laborious process came to a complete halt when Gygax suffered a serious stroke in April 2004 and then another one a few weeks later.<ref name=witwer />{{rp|211}} Although he returned to his keyboard after a seven-month convalescence, his output was reduced from 14-hour work days to only one or two hours per day.<ref>Gygax: "the problem is that I tire out after about an hour."{{cite web | title = Gary Gygax: Q & A (Part IV, Page 9) | publisher = EN World | date = November 2, 2003 | url = http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/57832-gary-gygax-q-part-iv-9.html | access-date = March 15, 2009 | archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/655lkxttI?url=http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/57832-gary-gygax-q-part-iv-9.html | archive-date = January 31, 2012 | url-status = dead }}</ref> Finally in 2005, ''Castle Zagyg Part I: Yggsburgh'', the first book in the six-book series, appeared.<ref name="designers" />{{rp|381}} Later that year, Troll Lord Games also published ''Castle Zagyg: Dark Chateau'' (2005), the adventure module written for the Yggsburgh setting by Rob Kuntz.<ref name="designers" />{{rp|381}} Jeff Talanian helped with the creation of the dungeon, eventually resulting in publication of the limited edition ''CZ9: The East Marks Gazetteer'' (2007).<ref name="designers" />{{rp|381}}

That same year, Gygax was diagnosed with a potentially deadly [[abdominal aortic aneurysm]]. Doctors concurred that surgery was needed, but their estimates of success varied from 50% to 90%. With no firm medical consensus, Gygax came to believe that he would likely die on the operating table; he refused to consider surgery, although he realized that a rupture of the aneurysm – likely inevitable – would be fatal.<ref name = witwer />{{rp|216}} In one concession to his condition, he switched from cigarettes, which he had smoked since high school, to cigars.<ref name=witwer />{{rp|212}}

It wasn't until 2008 that Gygax was able to finish the second volume of six volumes, ''Castle Zagyg: The Upper Works'', which described details of the castle above ground. The next two volumes were supposed to detail the dungeons beneath Castle Zagyg. However, before they could be written, Gygax died in March 2008. Three months after his death, Gygax Games – a new company formed by Gary's widow, Gail – withdrew all of the Gygax licenses from Troll Lord,<ref name="designers" />{{rp|382}} and also from Hekaforge.<ref name="designers" />{{rp|381}}

== Personal life ==
From an early age, Gygax hunted and was a target-shooter with both bow and gun.<ref>Gygax: "I got my first BB pistol when I was about 10, a Daisy BB gun when I was 11, and my first .22 rifle, a single-shot, bolt action Winchester for my 12th birthday—thanks to my grandfather, for mother was not keen on that. I loved plinking and hunting, and how badly I wanted a .25 lever action carbine I used to gaze at in the local Gamble's store is difficult to express in words. Never did get it. I did get a fine lemonwood bow made by Bear Archery, though. It had only a 38-pound pull, so my range was only about 120 yards with a hunting arrow."{{cite web|title = Gary Gygax: Q & A (Part VII, Page 23)|publisher = EN World|date = February 18, 2005|url = http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/104817-gary-gygax-q-part-vii-23.html|access-date = March 15, 2009|archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/655lm8yBG?url=http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/104817-gary-gygax-q-part-vii-23.html|archive-date = January 31, 2012|url-status = dead}}</ref> He was also an avid gun collector, and at various times owned a variety of rifles, shotguns, and handguns.<ref>Gygax: "Yes I own a number of handguns and shoulder weapons... over the next few years I did add several more .22 rifles, a bolt-action, three shot Mossberg 16 gauge shotgun, a old single-barreled 12 gauge, and a .32 pistol. The rifles were used for squirrel, rabbit, and varmint hunting, the shotguns for pheasants, ducks, and geese, and the revolver for target shooting. In later years I got rid of the old weapons, added a 7.62 Argentine Mauser, a 30–30 carbine, and various other rifles, shotguns, and quite a few handguns. Years later, when I used to get death threats because of D&D I always had a .357, 9&nbsp;mm, or .45 caliber pistol handy. If those were too conspicuous, a little .32, .25, or .22 derringer from Defender Arms was around.
