'''Ann Griffiths''' (née '''Thomas''', 1776–1805) was a [[Welsh poetry|Welsh poet]] and writer of [[Methodism|Methodist]] Christian hymns in the Welsh language. Her poetry reflects her fervent evangelical Christian faith and thorough scriptural knowledge.<ref>James E. Wyn: ''Introduction to the Life and Work of Ann Griffiths'' [http://www.anngriffiths.cardiff.ac.uk/introduction.html Retrieved 29 January 2018.]</ref>

==Biography==
[[File:A letter in the hand of Ann Griffiths (1776-1805) NLW3365236.jpg|thumb|A letter in the hand of Ann Griffiths]]
Ann was born in April 1776 near the village of [[Llanfihangel-yng-Ngwynfa]], {{convert|6|mi|spell=in|0}} from the market town of [[Llanfyllin]] in the former county of [[Montgomeryshire]] (now in [[Powys]]). She was the daughter of John Evan Thomas, a [[tenant farmer]] and churchwarden, and his wife, Jane. She had two older sisters, an older brother, John, and a younger brother, Edward. Her parents' house, Dolwar Fechan, was an isolated farmhouse some {{convert|2+1/2|mi|spell=in|0}} south of Llanfihangel and {{convert|1|mi|spell=in}} north of Dolanog, set among hills and streams.

Not far away lay [[St Melangell's Church, Pennant Melangell|Pennant Melangell]], where Saint [[Melangell]] had lived as a hermit in the 6th century.<ref>''[[Archaeologia Cambrensis]]'', Journal of the Cambrian Archaeological Association, Vol. III, 6th Series, London, 1903.</ref>

Ann was brought up in the Anglican church. In 1794, her mother died when she was 18, and about that time or perhaps earlier she followed her brothers John and Edward in being drawn to the Methodists. In 1796 she joined the [[Calvinistic Methodism|Calvinistic Methodist]] movement after hearing the preaching of Benjamin Jones of [[Pwllheli]].

After the deaths of both her parents, she married Thomas Griffiths, a farmer from the parish of [[Meifod]] and an elder of the Calvinistic Methodist church. However, she died after childbirth in August 1805, at the age of 29, and was buried on 12 August 1805 at Llanfihangel-yng-Ngwynfa.

Ann Griffiths left a handful of stanzas in the [[Welsh language]]. These were preserved and published by her mentor, the Calvinistic Methodist minister, John Hughes of [[Pontrobert]], and his wife, Ruth, who had been a maid at Ann Griffiths' farm and was a close confidante.

==Poetry==
Ann's poems express her fervent evangelical Christian faith and reflect her incisive intellect and thorough scriptural knowledge. She is the most prominent female [[hymnwriter|hymnist]] in Welsh. Her work is regarded as a highlight of [[Literature of Wales (Welsh language)|Welsh literature]], and her longest poem ''{{lang|cy|Rhyfedd, rhyfedd gan angylion...}}'' (Wondrous, wondrous to angels...)<ref>{{Cite web |last1=James |first1=E. Wyn |title=Introduction to the life and work of Ann Griffiths |url=http://www.anngriffiths.cardiff.ac.uk/introduction.html |website=gwefan Ann Griffiths website |publisher=Cardiff University |accessdate=26 April 2017}}</ref> was described by the dramatist and literary critic [[Saunders Lewis]] as "one of the majestic songs in the religious poetry of Europe".

Her hymn ''Wele'n sefyll rhwng y myrtwydd'' is commonly sung in Wales to the tune [[Cwm Rhondda]].

The service of enthronement of [[Rowan Williams]] as Archbishop of Canterbury in February 2003 included Williams' own translation of one of her hymns: "Yr Arglwydd Iesu (The Lord Jesus)".

==Legacy==
Together with [[Mary Jones and her Bible|Mary Jones]] (1784–1864), a poor Welsh girl who walked to Bala to buy a Bible, Ann Griffiths became a national icon by the end of the 19th century, and was a significant figure in Welsh [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformism]].<ref>{{Cite web |last1=James |first1=E. Wyn |title=Bala and the Bible: Thomas Charles, Ann Griffiths and Mary Jones |url=http://www.anngriffiths.cardiff.ac.uk/bible.html |publisher=Cardiff University}}</ref>

The Ann Griffiths Memorial Chapel in [[Dolanog]], Powys, is named after her and has a carved corbel head based on contemporary descriptions of her.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ann Griffiths Memorial Chapel, Dolanog |url=http://www.living-stones.info/en/attraction.php?image_id=13 |website=Living Stones |accessdate=11 March 2019}}</ref> There are stained glass windows in her memory in Eglwys y Crwys Welsh Presbyterian Church, Cathays, Cardiff, in the [[Williams Pantycelyn Memorial Chapel, Llandovery|Williams Pantycelyn Memorial Chapel]] in Llandovery, and in the Ceiriog Memorial Institute in [[Glyn Ceiriog]].

The television channel [[S4C]] commissioned ''Ann!'', a musical based on Ann Griffiths' life, to be performed at the 2003 [[National Eisteddfod]] at Meifod. This was later televised and released on CD.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Maldwyn Theatre Company – Ann! |url=http://www.sainwales.com/store/sain/sain-scd-2446 |website=[[Sain]] |accessdate=1 July 2017}}</ref>
