'''Henning Georg Mankell''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈhɛ̂nːɪŋ ˈmǎŋːkɛl}}; 3{{nbsp}}February 1948{{snd}}5{{nbsp}}October 2015) was a Swedish [[crime fiction|crime writer]], [[children's literature|children's author]], and [[playwright|dramatist]], best known for a series of [[Mystery fiction|mystery novels]] starring his most noted creation, Inspector [[Kurt Wallander]]. He also wrote a number of plays and screenplays for television.

He was a left-wing [[social critic]] and activist. In his books and plays he constantly highlighted social inequality issues and injustices in Sweden and abroad. In 2010, Mankell was on board one of the ships in the [[Gaza Freedom Flotilla]] that was boarded by Israeli commandos. He was below deck on the [[MV Mavi Marmara]] when nine civilians were killed in international waters.

Mankell shared his time between Sweden and countries in Africa, mostly Mozambique where he started a theatre. He made considerable donations to charity organizations, mostly connected to Africa.

== Life and career ==
Mankell's grandfather, also named [[Henning Mankell (composer)|Henning Mankell]], lived from 1868 to 1930 and was a composer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://henningmankell.se/Platser/Sveg/|title=Sveg|work=henningmankell.se|access-date=6 October 2015|language=sv|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006191544/http://henningmankell.se/Platser/Sveg/|archive-date=6 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Mankell was born in [[Stockholm]], Sweden in 1948. His father Ivar was a lawyer who divorced his mother when Mankell was one year old. He and an older sister lived with his father for most of their childhood. The family first lived in [[Sveg]], [[Härjedalen]] in northern Sweden, where Mankell's father was a district judge. In the biography on Mankell's website, he describes this time when they lived in a flat above the court as one of the happiest in his life.<ref name=bio>{{cite web|url=http://henningmankell.com/author/biography/|title=Henning Mankell: Biography|author=Henning Mankell|access-date=11 October 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015210055/http://henningmankell.com/author/biography/|archive-date=15 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In [[Sveg]], a museum was built in his honour during his lifetime.<ref name=obit />

Later, when Mankell was thirteen, the family moved to [[Borås]], [[Västergötland]] on the Swedish west coast near [[Gothenburg]].<ref name="bio" /> After three years he dropped out of school and went to [[Paris]] when he was 16. Shortly afterwards he joined the merchant marine, working on a [[cargo ship]] and he "loved the ship's decent hard-working community".<ref name=bio /> In 1966, he returned to Paris to become a writer. He took part in the [[May 1968 events in France|student uprising of 1968]]. He later returned to work as a stagehand in Stockholm.<ref name=obit /> At the age of 20, he had already started as author at [[Riksteatern]] in Stockholm.<ref name="kultur">{{cite web|last1=Schottenius|first1=Maria|title=Henning Mankell: Det var en livskatastrof|url=http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/henning-mankell-det-var-en-livskatastrof/|date=27 September 2014|website=www.dn.se|publisher=[[Dagens Nyheter]]|access-date=16 February 2016}}</ref> In the following years he collaborated with several theatres in Sweden. His first play, ''The Amusement Park'' dealt with [[Swedish colonization of the Americas|Swedish colonialism in South America]].<ref name= bio /> In 1973, he published ''The Stone Blaster'', a novel about the [[Swedish labour movement]]. He used the proceeds from the novel to travel to Guinea-Bissau. Africa would later become a second home to him, and he spent a big part of his life there. When his success as a writer made it possible, he founded and ran a theatre in Mozambique.<ref name=bio />

From 1991 to 2013, Mankell wrote the books which made him famous worldwide, the Kurt Wallender mystery novels. Wallender was a fictional detective living in Ystad in southern Sweden, who supervised a squad of detectives in solving murders, some of which were bizarre. As they worked to catch a killer who had to be stopped before he could kill again, the team often worked late into the nights in a heightened atmosphere of tension and crisis. Wallender's thoughts and worries about his daughter, his health, his lack of friends and a social life, his worries about Swedish society, shared his mental life with his many concerns and worries about the case he was working. There were ten books in the series. They were translated into many languages and sold millions of copies worldwide. The series gave Mankell the freedom and wherewithal to pursue other projects which interested him. 

After living in Zambia and other African countries, Mankell was invited from 1986 onward to become the artistic director of Teatro Avenida in [[Maputo]], Mozambique. He subsequently spent extended periods in Maputo working with the theatre and as a writer. He built his own publishing house, ''Leopard Förlag'', in order to support young talented writers from Africa and Sweden.<ref name="Damen">{{cite web|last = Damen|first = Jos|url = http://www.ascleiden.nl/news/henning-mankell-1948-2015-africa|title = Henning Mankell (1948–2015) & Africa|publisher = African Studies Centre Leiden|date = 16 April 2006|access-date = 8 October 2015}}</ref> His novel ''[[Chronicler of the Winds]]'', published in Sweden as ''Comédie infantil'' in 1995, reflects African problems and is based on African [[storytelling]].<ref name="Cowell">{{cite news| last = Cowell| first = Alan| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/27/books/27mank.html?oref=slogin| title = In a Break From Mystery Writing, Henning Mankell Turns to Africa| newspaper = [[The New York Times]]| date = 21 April 2006| access-date = 6 September 2015}}</ref> On 12{{nbsp}}June 2008, he was awarded an [[honorary Doctorate]] from the [[University of St Andrews]] in [[Scotland]] "in recognition of his major contribution to literature and to the practical exercise of conscience".<ref>{{cite web|

Around 2008, Mankell developed two original stories for the German police series ''[[Tatort]]''. Actor [[Axel Milberg]], who portrays Inspector [[Klaus Borowski]], had asked Mankell to contribute to the show when they were promoting ''[[The Man from Beijing (novel)|The Man from Beijing]]'' audiobook, a project that Milberg had worked on. The episodes were scheduled to broadcast in Germany in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/fernsehen/article2682891/Henning-Mankell-schreibt-zwei-Tatort-Krimis.html|title=Berühmte Autoren: Henning Mankell schreibt zwei "Tatort"-Krimis – Die Welt|date=6 November 2008|work=Die Welt|access-date=5 October 2015|language=de}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/die-welt/vermischtes/hamburg/article5514723/Ironie-macht-die-Dinge-oft-einfacher.html|title=Ironie macht die Dinge oft einfacher|author=Günter Fink|date=13 December 2009|work=[[Die Welt]]|access-date=5 October 2015|language=de}}</ref> In 2010, Mankell was set to work on a screenplay for [[Sveriges Television]] about his father-in-law, movie and theatre director [[Ingmar Bergman]], on a series produced in four one-hour episodes.

In his youth Mankell was a left-wing political activist and participated in the [[Protests of 1968]] in Sweden, protesting against, among other things, the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Portuguese Colonial War]], and the [[apartheid]] regime in South Africa. Furthermore, he got involved with ''[[Folket i Bild/Kulturfront]]'' which focused on cultural policy studies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/tekstarkiv/artikkel.php?id=5001010046786&tag=item&words=mankell%3Bakp|title=Tekstarkiv|work=Dagbladet|access-date=5 October 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006203830/http://www.dagbladet.no/tekstarkiv/artikkel.php?id=5001010046786&tag=item&words=mankell%3Bakp|archive-date=6 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In the 1970s, Mankell moved from Sweden to Norway and lived with a Norwegian woman who was a member of the [[Maoist]] [[Workers' Communist Party (Norway)|Workers' Communist Party]]. He took an active part in their activities but did not join the party.<ref>{{cite book|title=De svenska maoisterna|last=Augustsson|first=Lars Åke|author2=Hansén, Stig|year=2001|publisher=Lindelöw |location=Gothenburg|isbn=91-88144-48-8|language=sv}}</ref>

In 2002, Mankell gave financial support by buying stocks for 50,000 [[Norwegian krone|NOK]] in the Norwegian left-wing newspaper ''[[Klassekampen]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrk.no/programmer/radioarkiv/her___na/1900095.html|title=NRK.no – Her & Nå|work=NRK|access-date=5 October 2015}}</ref> In 2009, Mankell was a guest at the [[Palestine Festival of Literature]]. He said he had seen "repetition of the despicable apartheid system that once treated Africans and coloured as second-class citizens in their own country". He found a resemblance between the [[Israeli West Bank barrier]] and the [[Berlin Wall]]: "The wall that is currently dividing the country will prevent future attacks, in short term. In the end, it will face the same destiny as the wall that once divided Berlin did."<ref name="pulsemedia.org">{{cite web|url=http://pulsemedia.org/2009/06/27/ending-apartheid/|title=Ending Apartheid|work=P U L S E|date=27 June 2009|access-date=5 October 2015}}</ref> Considering the environment the Palestinian people live in, he continued: "Is it strange that some of them in pure desperation, when they cannot see any other way out, decide to become suicide bombers? Not really? Maybe it is strange that there are not more of them."<ref name="pulsemedia.org" />

Mankell stated in an interview with ''[[Haaretz]]'' that he did not support [[Hezbollah]].<ref name="haaretz.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/will-the-real-henning-mankell-speak-up-1.367761|title=Will the Real Henning Mankell Speak Up?|work=Haaretz.com|date=June 2011|access-date=5 October 2015}}</ref> In Mankell's opinion the state of Israel should not have a future as a [[two-state solution]] and this "will not be the end of the historical occupation". He said he did not encounter antisemitism during his journey, just "hatred against the occupants that is completely normal and understandable", and said that "to keep these two things separate is crucial".<ref name="pulsemedia.org" />

The ninth book, [[The Pyramid (short stories)|''The Pyramid'']] ([[1999 in literature|1999]]), is a prequel about Wallander's past, covering the time until just before the start of ''[[Faceless Killers]]'' ([[1991 in literature|1991]]). It includes a collection of five novellas:<ref name="wroe" />
*''Wallander's First Case''
*''The Man with the Mask''
*''The Man on the Beach''
*''The Death of the Photographer''
*''The Pyramid''

Ten years after ''The Pyramid'', Mankell published another Wallander novel, ''[[The Troubled Man]]'' ([[2009 in literature|2009]]), which he said would definitely be the last in the series.<ref name="wroe">Wroe, Nicholas (20 February 2010), [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/20/henning-mankell-interview "A Life in writing: Henning Mankell"], ''The Guardian''.</ref>

Linda is the daughter of Kurt Wallander, who follows in his footsteps as a police officer. Mankell began an intended trilogy of novels with her as the protagonist. However, following the suicide of [[Johanna Sällström]], the actress playing the character at the time in the Swedish TV series, Mankell was so distraught that he decided to abandon the series after only the first novel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/dec/27/wallandar-hemming-mankell-tv-books-detective|title=Henning Mankell creates a 'female Wallander' following star's suicide|author=Paul Gallagher|work=The Guardian|date=26 December 2009|access-date=2015-10-05}}</ref>
