==Biography==
[[File:Anthony_Joseph_Rudolstadt_15.jpg|thumb|left|Anthony Joseph at [[Rudolstadt-Festival]] 2017]]
Joseph was born in [[Port of Spain]], [[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidad]], where he was raised by his grandparents. He began writing as a young child and cites his main influences as [[Calypso music|calypso]], [[surrealism]], [[jazz]], the spiritual [[Baptist]] church that his grandparents attended, and the rhythms of [[Caribbean]] speech. Joseph has lived in the United Kingdom since 1989.

In September 2004 he was chosen by Renaissance One and [[Arts Council England]] as one of 50 Black and Asian writers who have made major contributions to contemporary British literature, appearing in the "A Great Day in London" photograph and performing at the event at the [[British Library]].<ref>[[Andrea Levy]], [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/sep/18/featuresreviews.guardianreview33 "Made in Britain. To celebrate the impact of their different perspectives, 50 writers of Caribbean, Asian and African descent gathered to be photographed.

And can they all fit on one staircase?", ''[[The Independent|The Independent on Sunday]]'', 17 October 2004.</ref> In April 2005, he served as the [[British Council]]'s first poet-in-residence at [[California State University]], Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishcouncil.org/usa-arts-literature-uk-writer-in-residence-about-anthony-joseph.htm|title=About Anthony Joseph |publisher=British Council |accessdate=25 January 2011}}</ref>

Joseph holds a PhD in Creative Writing from [[Goldsmiths College]], [[University of London]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contemporarywriters.com/authors/?p=auth5688E83E18e751E617wKr24EB81C |title=Anthony Joseph: Biography |publisher=British Council |accessdate=25 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070411034920/http://www.contemporarywriters.com/authors/?p=auth5688E83E18e751E617wKr24EB81C |archivedate=11 April 2007 }}</ref> He has taught at [[London Metropolitan University]], [[University of Surrey Roehampton]], [[South Thames College]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kindred-spirits.nl/artist.php?idxArtist%3D13427 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=9 December 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211230734/http://www.kindred-spirits.nl/artist.php?idxArtist=13427 |archivedate=11 December 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref> and [[Birkbeck College]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anthonyjoseph.co.uk/bio/ |title=Bio |publisher=Anthony Joseph |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=29 August 2016}}</ref>

Joseph is the author of the poetry collections ''[[Desafinado]]'' (1994), ''Teragaton'' (1997), ''Bird Head Son'' (2009) and ''Rubber Orchestras'' (2011). His debut novel, ''[[The African Origins of UFOs]]'', was published by [[Salt Publishing]] in November 2006. Described as an "afro-psychedelic-noir, a poetic work of metafiction, mythology and afro-futurism",{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} the book was endorsed by [[Kamau Brathwaite]], [[Linton Kwesi Johnson]], and [[Lauri Scheyer|Lauri Ramey]], who hailed it in her introduction as "a future fiction classic". Reviewing the book, Ali Alizadeh called Joseph "both a faithful heir and an agnostic rebel; a Black poet haunted by Africa's past as well as a bilingual post-modernist amused by the possibilities of the future. Contemporary literature doesn't come a lot more sophisticated and intriguing than this."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cordite.org.au/reviews/ali-alizadeh-reviews-anthony-joseph/ |title=Ali Alizadeh Reviews Anthony Joseph &#124; Cordite Poetry Review |website=Cordite.org.au |date=8 March 2007 |accessdate=29 August 2016}}</ref> Joseph received an Arts Council award to conduct a reading tour of the UK in support of the book. In 2007, the tour continued to Europe with a 10-city tour of Germany and readings in the US.
