'''James Maxwell Anderson''' (December 15, 1888 – February 28, 1959) was an American playwright, author, poet, journalist and lyricist.

==Background==
Anderson was born on December 15, 1888, in [[Atlantic, Pennsylvania]], the second of eight children to William Lincoln "Link" Anderson, a [[Baptist]] minister, and Charlotte Perrimela ('Premely') Stephenson, both of [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scotch-Irish]] descent.<ref>Who Was Who in the Theatre:1912-1976 Vol. A-C culminated from annual editions originally published by John Parker; this 1976 edition by Gale Research. Retrieved August 8, 2018</ref> His family initially lived on his maternal grandmother Sheperd's farm in Atlantic, then moved to [[Andover, Ohio]], where his father became a railroad fireman while studying to become a minister. They moved often, to follow their father's ministerial posts, and Maxwell was frequently sick, missing a great deal of school. He used his time sick in bed to read voraciously, and both his parents and Aunt Emma were storytellers, which contributed to Anderson's love of literature.

During a visit to his grandmother's house in Atlantic, at age 11, he met the first love of his life, Hallie Loomis, a slightly older girl from a wealthier family. His autobiographical tale, ''[[Morning, Winter and Night]]'' told of rape, incest and sadomasochism on the farm.<ref>''[[Morning, Winter and Night]]''</ref> It was published under a pseudonym, [[John Nairne Michealson]], to prevent offending family. The Andersons bounced between [[Andover, Ohio]], [[Richmond Center, Ohio]], [[Townville, Pennsylvania|Townville, Pa.]], [[Edinboro, Pennsylvania|Edinboro, Pa.]], [[McKeesport, Pennsylvania|McKeesport, Pa.]], [[New Brighton, Pennsylvania|New Brighton, Pa.]], [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg, Pa.]], to [[Jamestown, North Dakota]] in 1907, where Anderson attended Jamestown High School, graduating in 1908.

==Career==

===Journalist===
As an undergraduate, he waited tables and worked at the night copy desk of the ''[[Grand Forks Herald]]'', and was active in the school's literary and dramatic societies. He obtained a BA in English Literature from the [[University of North Dakota]] in 1911. He became the principal of a high school in [[Minnewaukan, North Dakota]], also teaching English there, but was fired in 1913 for making [[pacifism|pacifist]] statements to his students. He then entered [[Stanford University]], obtaining an [[Master's degree|M.A.]] in English Literature in 1914. He became a high school English teacher in San Francisco: after three years he became chairman of the English department at [[Whittier College]] in 1917. He was fired after a year for public statements supporting Arthur Camp, a jailed student seeking status as a [[conscientious objector]].

Anderson moved to [[Palo Alto]] to write for the ''[[San Francisco Evening Bulletin]]'', but was fired for writing an editorial stating that it would be impossible for Germany to pay off its war debt. So he moved to San Francisco to write for the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', but was fired after contracting the [[Spanish flu]] and missing work. Alvin Johnson hired Anderson to move to New York City and write about politics for ''[[The New Republic]]'' in 1918, but he was fired after an argument with Editor-in-Chief [[Herbert Croly|Herbert David Croly]].

Anderson found work at ''[[The New York Globe]]'', and the ''[[New York World]]''. In 1921, he founded ''The Measure: A Journal of Poetry'', a magazine devoted to verse. He wrote his first play, ''White Desert'', in 1923; it ran only twelve performances, but was well-reviewed by the book reviewer for the ''[[New York World]]'', [[Laurence Stallings]], who collaborated with him on his next play, ''What Price Glory?'', which was successfully produced in 1924 in New York City. Afterwards he resigned from the ''World'', launching his career as a dramatist.<ref>{{cite book|last=Shivers|first=Alfred|title=The Life of Maxwell Anderson|year=1983|publisher=Stein and Day|location=New York|isbn=0-8128-2789-9|pages=61–63}}</ref>

===Dramatist===
His plays are in widely varying styles, and Anderson was one of the few modern playwrights to make extensive use of [[blank verse]]. Some of these were adapted as films, and Anderson wrote the screenplays of other authors' plays and novels – ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film)|All Quiet on the Western Front]]'' (1930) and ''[[Death Takes a Holiday]]'' (1934) – in addition to books of poetry and essays. His first [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] hit was the 1924 [[World War I]] comedy-drama, ''What Price Glory'', written with [[Laurence Stallings]]. The play made use of profanity, which caused censors to protest. But when the chief censor (Rear Admiral [[Charles Peshall Plunkett]]) was found to have written far more obscene letters to General Chamberlaine, he was discredited: soldiers really did speak that way.<ref>{{cite book|last=Shivers|first=Alfred|title=The Life of Maxwell Anderson|year=1983|isbn=0-8128-2789-9}}</ref>

The only one of his plays that he himself adapted to the screen was ''[[Joan of Lorraine]]'', which became the film ''[[Joan of Arc (1948 film)|Joan of Arc]]'' (1948) starring [[Ingrid Bergman]], with a screenplay by Anderson and [[Andrew P. Solt|Andrew Solt]]. When Bergman and her director changed much of his dialogue to make Joan "a plaster saint" he called her a "big, dumb, goddamn [[Swedish people|Swede]]!" Anderson was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama|Pulitzer Prize]] in 1933 for his political drama ''[[Both Your Houses]]'', and twice received the [[New York Drama Critics Circle Award]], for ''[[Winterset (play)|Winterset]]'', and ''[[High Tor (play)|High Tor]]''.

Anderson enjoyed great commercial success with a series of plays set during the reign of the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] family, who ruled [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Ireland]] from 1485 until 1603. One play in particular – ''[[Anne of the Thousand Days#Background and production|Anne of the Thousand Days]]'' – the story of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s marriage to [[Anne Boleyn]] – was a hit on the stage in 1948, but did not reach movie screens for 21 years. It opened on Broadway starring [[Rex Harrison]] and [[Joyce Redman]], and became a [[Anne of the Thousand Days|1969 movie]] with [[Richard Burton]] and [[Geneviève Bujold]]. [[Margaret Furse]] won an Oscar for the film's costume designs.

Another of his Tudor plays, ''[[Elizabeth the Queen (play)|Elizabeth the Queen]]'' opened in 1930 with [[Lynn Fontanne]] as Elizabeth and [[Alfred Lunt]] as Lord Essex. It was later adapted to the screen as ''[[The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex]]'' (1939), starring [[Bette Davis]] and [[Errol Flynn]]. Directed by [[John Ford]], ''[[Mary of Scotland (film)|Mary of Scotland]]'' (1936) was an adaptation of his play of the same name involving Elizabeth I, starring [[Katharine Hepburn]] as [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], [[Fredric March]] as the [[Earl of Bothwell]], and [[Florence Eldridge]] as Elizabeth. The original play had been a hit on Broadway starring [[Helen Hayes]] in the title role.

His play ''[[The Wingless Victory]]'' was written in verse and premiered in 1936 with Broadway actress [[Katharine Cornell]] in the lead role. It received mixed reviews.<ref>Tad Mosel, "Leading Lady: The World and Theatre of Katharine Cornell", Little, Brown & Co., Boston (1978)</ref>

===Adaptations===
Two of Anderson's other historical plays, ''[[Valley Forge (play)|Valley Forge]]'', about [[George Washington]]'s winter there with the [[Continental Army]], and ''Barefoot in Athens'', concerning the [[trial of Socrates]], were adapted for television. ''Valley Forge'' was adapted for television on three occasions – in 1950, 1951 and 1975. Anderson wrote book and lyrics for two successful musicals with composer [[Kurt Weill]]. ''[[Knickerbocker Holiday]]'', about the early Dutch settlers of New York, featured [[Walter Huston]] as [[Peter Stuyvesant]]. The show's standout number, "[[September Song]]", became a popular standard. So did the title song of Anderson and Weill's ''[[Lost in the Stars]]'', a story of South Africa based on the [[Alan Paton]] novel ''[[Cry, The Beloved Country]]''. In 1950, Anderson and Weill began collaboration on a musical adaptation of [[Mark Twain]]'s [[Huckleberry Finn]], but Weill died when only a few songs had been completed for it.

Anderson's long-running 1927 comedy-drama about married life, ''Saturday's Children'', in which [[Humphrey Bogart]] made an early appearance, was filmed three times – in 1929 as a [[part-talkie]], in 1935 (in almost unrecognizable form) as a [[B-film]] ''Maybe It's Love'' and once again in [[Saturday's Children|1940]] under its original title, starring [[John Garfield]] in one of his few romantic comedies, along with [[Anne Shirley]] and [[Claude Rains]]. The play was also adapted for television in three condensed versions in 1950, 1952 and 1962.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/find?s=ep&q=Saturday's+Children|title=- IMDb|website=IMDb}}</ref>

His last successful [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] stage play was 1954's ''[[The Bad Seed (play)|The Bad Seed]]'', Anderson's adaption of the [[The Bad Seed|William March novel]]. He was hired by [[Alfred Hitchcock]] to write the screenplay for Hitchcock's ''[[The Wrong Man]]'' (1957). Hitchcock also contracted with Anderson to write the screenplay for what became ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958), but Hitchcock rejected his screenplay ''Darkling, I Listen''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052357/trivia|title=Vertigo (1958) - IMDb|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref>

==Personal life and death==
Anderson married Margaret Haskett, a classmate, on August 1, 1911 in [[Bottineau, North Dakota]]. They had three sons, [[Quentin Anderson|Quentin]], Alan, and Terence.

In 1929, Anderson wrote what would prove to be a prophetic play, ''Gypsy,'' about a vain, neurotic liar who cheats on her husband then commits suicide by inhaling gas after he catches her.<ref>''The Life of Maxwell Anderson'' by Alfred S. Shivers, PhD published by Stein and Day, New York, 1983. {{ISBN|0-8128-2789-9}}</ref> It is around this same time, circa 1930, that Anderson began a relationship with a married actress, Gertrude Higger (married name, Mab Maynard, stage name Mab Anthony). The affair led Anderson to split with Haskett, who later died in 1931 following a car accident and stroke.

Mab divorced her husband, singer Charles V. Maynard, and moved in with Anderson. She was a significant help with clerical duties, but had expensive tastes and spent Anderson's money freely. Their daughter, Hesper, was born August 1934. Anderson left Maynard<ref>''The Life of Maxwell Anderson'' by Alfred S. Shivers, PhD published by Stein and Day, New York, 1983. {{ISBN|0-8128-2789-9}}
</ref> following the discovery of her affair with Max's friend, TV producer Jerry Stagg. The combination of losing Anderson, their massive tax debt, and the loss of her home proved too much for Mab, who on March 21, 1953, after several unsuccessful attempts, committed suicide by breathing car exhaust. Hesper wrote a book, ''South Mountain Road: A Daughter's Journey of Discovery'' describing how following her mother's suicide, she unearthed the fact that her parents never married.

Anderson married once more, to ABC's TV [[Celanese Theater]] Production Assistant, Gilda Hazard, on June 6, 1954.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0027173/bio|title=Maxwell Anderson|website=IMDb}}</ref> This final marriage was a happy one, lasting until Anderson's 1959 death.

Anderson was an atheist.<ref>Gale, C. (2016). A Study Guide for Maxwell Anderson's ""Winterset, "" excerpted from Gale's acclaimed Drama For Students. This concise study guide includes plot summary; character analysis; author biography; study questions; historical context; suggestions for further reading. Farmington Hills: Gale, Cengage Learning.</ref>

Anderson died in [[Stamford, Connecticut]], on February 28, 1959, two days after suffering a [[Cerebrovascular accident|stroke]], aged 70. He was cremated. Half of his ashes were scattered by the sea near his home in Stamford. The other half was buried in Anderson Cemetery near his birthplace in rural northwestern Pennsylvania. The inscription on his tombstone reads:    <blockquote> <small> Children of dust astray among the stars<br /> Children of earth adrift upon the night<br /> What is there in our darkness or our light<br /> To linger in prose or claim a singing breath<br /> Save the curt history of life isled in death{{citation needed|date=July 2020}} </small> </blockquote>

==Awards==
Honorary awards include the gold medal in Drama from the [[National Institute of Arts and Letters]] in 1954, an honorary doctor of literature degree from [[Columbia University]] in 1946, and an honorary doctor of humanities degree from the [[University of North Dakota]] in 1958.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}
