==Family life==

Raised by his parents, who immigrated from [[England]], Stanley Burnshaw was born and brought up in [[New York City]]. There are few detailed depictions of his childhood, but in his later years Burnshaw wrote two poems giving light on that time period of his life.

Burnshaw married Susan Copen Oken.<ref>{{cite web|last1=MARTIN|first1=Douglas|title=Stanley Burnshaw, Poet, Editor and Critic, Dies at 99|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/17/arts/17burnshaw.html|website=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=25 December 2014}}</ref> Burnshaw had daughter, Valeri Razavi, and later became the grandparents to one grandson.

==Education==

Burnshaw began his secondary education at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], transferred to [[Columbia University]], and then transferred back to the University of Pittsburgh again to earn his bachelor's degree. After saving up money, Burnshaw traveled to Europe in 1927 to attend the [[University of Poitiers]] and eventually [[Sorbonne University]]. Then in 1928, he returned to New York to attend graduate school at [[New York University]] and earned his [[Master's degree]].

==Career==

Burnshaw made a career plan to become a teacher and a writer. To save money and get started in his future career, Burnshaw started working at the Blaw-Knox Steel Corporation in [[Blawnox, Pennsylvania]] as an assistant copywriter. After he returned from Europe, Burnshaw began working at the [[Hecht Company]] in [[New York City]] as an advertising manager. Resigning from the [[Hecht Company]] in 1932, his next job was doing multiple duties (co-editor, drama critic, and occasional book reviewer) for ''[[The New Masses]]'', a weekly editorial in New York City.  In the 1930s Burnshaw got more interested in publishing. He first became the editor-in-chief for the Cordon Company in New York, then president and editor-in-chief of the Dryden Press (a firm he started) which merged with [[Holt, Rinehart and Winston]] in the late 1950s. Until 1968 Burnshaw was a consultant to the house and vice-president  of Dryden Press. He published many prose, poems, books, editorials, and remained active in many other aspects of his career until his death in September 2005.
