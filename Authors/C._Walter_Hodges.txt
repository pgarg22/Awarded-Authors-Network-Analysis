[[File:Cyril Walter Hodges.jpg|thumb|right|C. Walter Hodges]]
'''Cyril Walter Hodges''' (18 March 1909 – 26 November 2004)<ref name=tucker/> was an [[English people|English]] artist and writer best known for illustrating [[children's books]] and for helping to recreate [[Elizabethan theatre]]. He won the annual [[Greenaway Medal]] for British children's book [[illustration]] in 1964.<ref name=medal1964/>

==Career==
Cyril Walter Hodges was born in [[Beckenham]], [[Kent]], the son of Cyril Hodges<!-- not [[Cyril Hodges]] -->, "a leading figure in advertising and copyrighting".<ref name=newley/> He was educated at [[Dulwich College]], which he recalled as "a wretched imprisonment", and at [[Goldsmiths, University of London|Goldsmiths' College of Art]].<ref name=tucker/> Hodges fell in love with Greta Becker, a hopeful ballet dancer, and they married in 1936. She provided "complete domestic support" until she died in 1999.<ref name=tucker/>

Hodges spent most of his career as a [[freelance]] illustrator. For many years he did line drawings for the ''[[Radio Times]]''. He also produced its 1938 Christmas edition. Among the writers for children with whom he collaborated as an illustrator were [[Ian Serraillier]], [[Rosemary Sutcliff]] (''[[The Eagle of the Ninth]]''), [[Rhoda Power]] ([[Rhoda Power#Redcap Runs Away|''Redcap Runs Away'']]), [[Elizabeth Goudge]] (''[[The Little White Horse]]'') and [[William Mayne]].

During a year spent in New York he wrote and illustrated ''Columbus Sails'' (1939), a work of [[historical fiction]] for children. It proved popular on both sides of the Atlantic. Its success eventually led to several others including ''The Namesake: A Story Of [[Alfred the Great|King Alfred]]'' and its sequel ''The Marsh King''; ''Magna Carta''; ''The Norman Conquest''; and ''The Spanish Armada'' (1964 to 1967).<ref name=newley/><ref name=worldcat/> ''The Namesake'' was a commended runner up for the annual [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]], which recognises the author of the year's best British children's book.<ref name=ccsu/>{{efn |name=HC}}

==Theatre==
[[File:Imaginary view of an Elizabethan stage.jpg|thumb|Hodges' imagined view of an Elizabethan performance]]
Hodges designed costumes and scenery for the [[Everyman Theatre, Liverpool]] (1928–30) and for the [[Mermaid Theatre]] and [[St. George's Hall, London]] in the 1950s. His love of theatre led to him becoming an authority on the construction of the [[Globe Theatre|Globe]] and other [[Theater (structure)|theatre]]s of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s time.

From 1935 to 1999 he both wrote and illustrated five books about theatre in that time. He had thirty years experience in theatre practice and scholarship before doing ''Shakespeare's Theatre'' for children, published by [[Oxford University Press]] in 1964. For that he won the annual [[Kate Greenaway Medal]] from the [[CILIP|Library Association]], recognising the year's best children's book illustration by a [[British subject]].<ref name=medal1964/> Only one other Greenaway Medal in almost sixty years has been awarded for the illustration of nonfiction.{{efn |name=nonfiction}} According to one library catalogue summary, ''Shakespeare's Theatre'' "[e]xamines how the pagan festivals and religious dramas performed throughout England evolved into the professional theaters, such as the Globe, in London."<ref name=worldcat/> It also illustrates and describes "Shakespeare's famous and now rebuilt [[Globe Theatre]]".<ref name=medal1964/>

Hodges argued in one of his books that "the theatre as an institution is the pre-eminent arrangement whereby human beings work out the models of their own conduct, their morality and aspiration, their ideas of good and evil, and in general those fantasies about themselves and their fellows which, if persisted in, tend to eventually become facts in real life. If this is so, and it would be hard to deny, then the theatre must be seen as a most powerful instrument in the social history of mankind, and its own history must therefore be allowed a corresponding importance."<ref name=outloud/>

[[File:Conceptual drawing for Shakespeare's Globe in Detroit.jpg|thumb|Conceptual drawing for Shakespeare's Globe in Detroit]]Hodges's Shakespearean expertise led [[Wayne State University]] theatre department chair Leonard Leone to invite him to Detroit in the late 1970s and early 1980s to work on Leone's proposed reconstruction of the Globe Theatre on the Detroit River. The city suffered financially after the collapse of the [[Automotive industry in the United States|U.S. auto industry]] and the project fell apart in 1982.

In 1986, Hodges sold his theatrical and Elizabethan drawings (almost 900 items) plus their copyright to the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Folger Shakespeare Library|title=Guide to the C. Walter Hodges Collection of Elizabethan and Other Theatre Drawings, 1933-1990|url=http://findingaids.folger.edu/dfohodgesc.xml|accessdate=9 August 2014}}</ref> Because the Folger makes its digital image collection available under a [[Creative Commons]] Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International license, the drawings are now free cultural works.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://luna.folger.edu/luna/servlet/FOLGERCM1~6~6 |website=www.luna.folger.edu |title=Browse Folger Digital Image Collection |publisher=Folger Shakespeare Library |accessdate=19 August 2015 }}</ref>

{{notelist |notes=
{{efn |name=HC |1= Since 1995 there are usually eight books on the Carnegie Medal shortlist. According to CCSU, some runners up were Commended (from 1959) or Highly Commended (from 1974). There were about 160 commendations of both kinds in 49 years from 1954 to 2002, including Hodges and three others for 1964.}}
{{efn |name=nonfiction |1= [[Pauline Baynes]] won the 1968 Greenaway Medal for illustrating a reference book, ''A Dictionary of Chivalry'' (Longman, 1968), edited by Grant Uden. Since then two illustrators have won the medal for [[historical fiction]]s that the librarians call "information books": [[Victor Ambrus]] for ''Horses in Battle'' (Oxford, 1975) and [[Chris Riddell]] for ''[[Pirate Diary]]'' (Walker, 2001), written by Richard Platt. A few other winning works may be called neither fiction nor non-fiction; for example, the [[alphabet book]] ''ABC'' (Oxford, 1962) by [[Brian Wildsmith]].}}
