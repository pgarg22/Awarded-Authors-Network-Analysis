The Palestinian-Israeli novelist [[Anton Shammas]] has translated a collection of Taha Muhammad Ali's work into Hebrew.

==Poetic style==
Muhammad Ali's style has been described in the introduction to his English collection as "forceful" and written "in short lines of varying beats with a minimum of fuss and a rich array of images drawn primarily from his village life."

In a review of ''So What: New & Selected Poems'', he is described as a "beguiling story-teller who maintains a tone of credibility and lucidity without diluting the mysterious or distressing aspects of his tale...By avoiding commonplace response to everyday experience he has written poems that are fragile and graceful and fresh."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiseditions.com/home/recent3.htm|title=Review in The Nation}}</ref>
