'''Stephen Reeder Donaldson''' (born May 13, 1947) is an American [[fantasy fiction|fantasy]], [[science fiction]] and [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] novelist, most famous for ''[[The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant]]'', his ten-novel fantasy series. His work is characterized by psychological complexity, conceptual abstractness, moral bleakness, and the use of an arcane vocabulary, and has attracted critical praise for its "imagination, vivid characterizations, and fast pace".<ref>[http://www.enotes.com/contemporary-literary-criticism/donaldson-stephen-r "Stephen R. Donaldson Criticism"]. ''Contemporary Literary Criticism''. Enotes.com. Accessed 28 November 2010.</ref> He earned his [[bachelor's degree]] from [[The College of Wooster]] and a [[Master's degree]] from [[Kent State University]].  He currently resides in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]].

==Personal life==
Donaldson spent part of his youth in India, where his father, a medical missionary, worked with lepers. Donaldson attended what is now the [[Kodaikanal International School]].  He was attending [[Kent State University]] as a graduate student at the time of the [[Kent State shootings]] on May 4, 1970. Though he was not on campus at the time of the shootings, his apartment was one and a half blocks away, and he was forced to live under [[martial law]] for three days afterwards. Donaldson does not like to discuss the incident, as he finds the memories disturbing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenrdonaldson.com/fromtheauthor/gi_view.php?Year=2004&Month=08|title=Stephen R. Donaldson - Official Website|author=Donaldson, Stephen R.|publisher=StephenRDonaldson.com|date=August 30, 2004|access-date=May 5, 2012}}</ref>

Donaldson is a fan of [[opera]], and has said that he "love[s] that direct expression of passionate emotion in beautiful sound".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenrdonaldson.com/fromtheauthor/gi_view.php?Year=2011&Month=08|title=Stephen R. Donaldson - Official Website|author=Donaldson, Stephen R.|publisher=StephenRDonaldson.com|date=August 3, 2011|access-date=May 5, 2012}}</ref> In 1994, he gained a black belt in [[Shotokan]] karate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenrdonaldson.com/background/index.php|title=Biography|publisher=stephenrdonaldson.com|access-date=May 1, 2016}}</ref>

==Major influences==
Donaldson is part of the generation of fantasy authors which came to prominence in the 1970s and early 1980s. Like that of many of his peers, his writing is heavily influenced by the works of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. However, Donaldson's stories show a wide range of other influences, including [[Mervyn Peake]], [[C. S. Lewis]], [[Robert E. Howard]], and the operas of [[Richard Wagner]]. Donaldson is also a great fan of [[Roger Zelazny]]'s ''[[Amber (fictional realm)|Amber]]'' novels, which were a direct inspiration for his own ''[[Mordant's Need]]'' series. Also, in the ''Gradual Interview'' section of his website, Donaldson mentions his extensive study of [[Joseph Conrad]], [[Henry James]] and [[William Faulkner]] to further develop his narrative style.

Donaldson has said, "two inert elements combine to produce something of frightening potency." For the Thomas Covenant books, when he put unbelief and leprosy together, "... my brain took fire."

==''The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant''==
{{Main|The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant}}

Donaldson's most celebrated series is ''[[The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant]]'', which centers on a cynical [[leper]], shunned by society, who is destined to become the heroic savior of another world. Covenant struggles against the tyrannical Lord Foul, who intends to break the physical universe in order to escape his bondage and wreak revenge upon his arch enemy, The Creator.

The ''Chronicles'' were originally published as two trilogies of novels between 1977 and 1983. According to his current publisher, Putnam's, those two series sold more than 10 million copies. A third series, ''The Last Chronicles of Thomas Covenant'', began publication in 2004 with the novel ''The Runes of the Earth''.   With the second book of that series, ''Fatal Revenant'', Donaldson again attained bestseller status when the book reached number 12 on the [[New York Times Bestseller List|''New York Times'' Bestseller List]] in October 2007.

=== The First Chronicles ===
:#''[[Lord Foul's Bane]]''  (1977)
:#''[[The Illearth War]]'' (1977)
:#''[[The Power That Preserves]]'' (1979)

=== The Second Chronicles ===
:#''[[The Wounded Land]]''  (1980)
:#''[[The One Tree]]'' (1982)
:#''[[White Gold Wielder]]'' (1983)

=== The Last Chronicles ===
:#''[[The Runes of the Earth]]'' (2004)
:#''[[Fatal Revenant]]'' (2007)
:#''[[Against All Things Ending]]'' (2010)
:#''[[The Last Dark]]'' (2013)

==The Gap Cycle==
A [[science fiction]] epic set in a future where humans have pushed far out into space in the attempt to replace depleted resources, ''[[The Gap Cycle]]'' follows two concurrent story arcs. The first concerns an ensign in the United Mining Companies Police (UMCP), Morn Hyland, who is attempting simply to stay alive after being captured by a marauder named Angus Thermopyle. The second follows the Byzantine political maneuvering of the head of the UMCP, Warden Dios, as he attempts to thwart the machinations of his boss, Holt Fasner, who is the CEO of United Mining Companies (UMC) and the most powerful man in human space.

Each of the epics takes place against the backdrop of a threat to human survival itself from an alien species called the [[Amnion (Gap Cycle)|Amnion]] who use genetic mutation as a way to assimilate and overcome. Trade in raw materials (mostly ores) is carried out with the Amnion in exchange for technology, by both the UMC and illegals. Some illegals trade in Amnion territorial space, referred to as "forbidden space", out of bounds to the UMCP by treaty.

Donaldson wrote the series in part to be a reworking of [[Wagner]]'s [[Ring Cycle]]. The "Gap" of the title refers to the [[faster-than-light]] drives used by the space vessels in order to cross great distances, an instantaneous occurrence similar to the notion of "folding" space.

===The Gap series===
# ''[[The Real Story|The Gap into Conflict: The Real Story]]'' (1991)
# ''[[Forbidden Knowledge|The Gap into Vision: Forbidden Knowledge]]'' (1991)
# ''[[A Dark and Hungry God Arises|The Gap into Power: A Dark and Hungry God Arises]]'' (1992)
# ''[[Chaos and Order|The Gap into Madness: Chaos and Order]]'' (1994)
# ''[[This Day All Gods Die|The Gap into Ruin: This Day All Gods Die]]'' (1996)

The 2008 reprinting of the series combines ''The Real Story'' and ''Forbidden Knowledge'' into a single volume.  According to Donaldson's website, this was done at his request.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.stephenrdonaldson.com/fromtheauthor/gi_view.php?Year=2008&Month=09&Filter=&all=forbidden-%7c-knowledge-%7c-real-%7c-story | title = Gradual Interview (September 2008): Stephen R.

==Other works==

===Early work===
Donaldson has stated that, when he was younger, he wrote two [[fan fiction|fan-fiction]] novellas: one based on [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], and the other based on [[Joseph Conrad]]'s ''[[Heart of Darkness]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenrdonaldson.com/fromtheauthor/gi_view.php?Year=2004&Month=04|title=Stephen R. Donaldson - Official Website|author=Donaldson, Stephen R.|publisher=StephenRDonaldson.com|date=April 14, 2004|access-date=May 5, 2012}}</ref> These have never been published. As Donaldson grew older, he discovered that the sensation that he was "making it all up" himself was necessary for his imagination to work well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenrdonaldson.com/fromtheauthor/gi_view.php?Year=2009&Month=12|title=Stephen R. Donaldson - Official Website|author=Donaldson, Stephen R.|publisher=StephenRDonaldson.com|date=December 18, 2009|access-date=May 5, 2012}}</ref> He now regards these early novellas as failed experiments in the process of discovering himself as a writer. He feels the same way about a play he wrote, whose performance at [[Kent State University]] convinced him that he was "not cut out to be a playwright".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenrdonaldson.com/fromtheauthor/gi_view.php?Year=2011&Month=03|title=Stephen R.

===''Mordant's Need''===
{{main|Mordant's Need}}
# ''[[The Mirror of Her Dreams]]'' (1986)
# ''[[A Man Rides Through]]'' (1987)

===''The Man Who''===
''The Man Who'' is a series of mystery novels written by Donaldson and published under the pseudonym '''Reed Stephens''', derived from his full name, "Stephen Reeder Donaldson". Donaldson "always hated" writing under a false name, but was forced to do so by his publisher, [[Ballantine Books]], who had a firm belief in "category publishing" and thought that readers would feel betrayed if books of such different genres were published under the name of a single author. However, the books sold poorly even when they were re-printed under Donaldson's name by [[Tor Books|Tor/Forge Books]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenrdonaldson.com/fromtheauthor/gi_view.php?Year=2004&Month=12|title=Stephen R.

Donaldson has indicated that he intends to write at least one more ''The Man Who'' novel after completion of ''The Last Chronicles''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenrdonaldson.com/fromtheauthor/gi_view.php?Year=2006&Month=3|title=Stephen R.
