==Biography and work==
Dehn was born in 1912 in [[Manchester]], England. He was educated at [[Shrewsbury School]], and attended [[Brasenose College, Oxford]].<ref>[[Clifford Dyment]], [[Roy Fuller]] and [[Montagu Slater]] (editors), ''New Poems 1952'' (1952), p. 161.</ref> While at Oxford, he contributed film reviews to weekly undergraduate papers.

He began his career in 1936 as a film reviewer for several London newspapers.  He was film critic for the ''[[News Chronicle]]'' until its closure in 1960 and then for the ''[[Daily Herald (United Kingdom)|Daily Herald]]'' until 1963.<ref>advert placed by the ''Daily Herald'' in the ''Coventry Evening Telegraph'', 31 October 1960</ref>

During [[World War II]] he was stationed at [[Camp X]] in [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. This was one of several training facilities operated by the British [[Special Operations Executive]] to train spies and special forces teams. He was the Political Warfare officer from 1942 to 1944 and held the rank of Major. Dehn took part in missions in France and Norway.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/7601274/The-secret-war-mission-that-inspired-Goldfinger-scene.html | title=The secret war mission that inspired Goldfinger scene| date=17 April 2010| last1=Harrison| first1=David}}</ref>

He narrated the 1951 film ''[[Waters of Time]]'' and later wrote plays, operettas and musicals for the stage. He wrote the lyrics for songs in two films, ''[[The Innocents (1961 film)|The Innocents]]'' (1961) and ''[[Moulin Rouge (1952 film)|Moulin Rouge]]'' (1952).

In 1949 or 1950, Dehn began a professional collaboration with composer [[James Bernard (composer)|James Bernard]]. Dehn asked Bernard to collaborate with him on the original screen story for the [[Boulting Brothers]] film ''[[Seven Days to Noon]]'' (1950).

Through the 1960s, Dehn concentrated on screenwriting for espionage films, notably ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' (1964), ''[[The Spy Who Came in from the Cold (film)|The Spy Who Came in from the Cold]]'' (1965), and ''[[The Deadly Affair]]'' (1967). He later wrote the screenplays for the second, third, and fourth original ''[[Planet of the Apes (franchise)|Planet of the Apes]]'' movies and received the story-by credit on the fifth. He wrote the [[libretto]] for [[William Walton]]'s opera ''[[The Bear (opera)|The Bear]]'' and two by [[Lennox Berkeley]]; ''[[A Dinner Engagement]]'' and ''Castaway''.

His last screenplay was for [[Sidney Lumet]]'s all-star ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]]'' (1974), based on the [[Agatha Christie]] [[whodunit]], for which he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.

Dehn resurrected or reinvented at least three genres given up for dead at the time; the British mystery, the Shakespeare adaptation, and the spy film.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kipen|first=David|year=2013|title=Tinker Tailor Soldier Schreiber: The Unsung Achievement of Screenwriter Paul Dehn|journal=Virginia Quarterly Review|volume=89|issue=1|pages=224–231|jstor=26446667}}</ref>
