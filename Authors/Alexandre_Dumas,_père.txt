'''Alexandre Dumas''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|dj|uː|m|ɑː|,_|d|ʊ|ˈ|m|ɑː}}, {{IPAc-en|US|d|uː|ˈ|m|ɑː}}; {{IPA-fr|alɛksɑ̃dʁ dymɑ|lang}}; born '''Dumas Davy de la Pailleterie''' ({{IPA-fr|dymɑ davi də la pajət(ə)ʁi|}}), 24 July 1802 – 5 December 1870),<ref>{{cite LPD|3}}</ref><ref>{{cite EPD|18}}</ref> also known as '''Alexandre Dumas père''' (where ''[[Suffix (name)#Generational titles|{{lang|fr|père|nocat=y}}]]'' is [[French language|French]] for 'father', to distinguish him from his son [[Alexandre Dumas fils]]), was a French writer. His works have been translated into many languages and he is one of the most widely read French authors. Many of his historical novels of high adventure were originally published as [[serial (literature)|serials]], including ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'', ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'', ''[[Twenty Years After]]'' and ''[[The Vicomte of Bragelonne: Ten Years Later]]''. His novels have been adapted since the early twentieth century into nearly 200 films.

Prolific in several genres, Dumas began his career by writing plays, which were successfully produced from the first. He also wrote numerous magazine [[essay|articles]] and travel books; his published works totalled 100,000 pages.<ref name="Hamel"/> In the 1840s, Dumas founded the [[Théâtre Historique]] in Paris.

His father, General [[Thomas-Alexandre Dumas|Thomas-Alexandre Dumas Davy de la Pailleterie]], was born in the French colony of [[Saint-Domingue]] (present-day [[Haiti]]) to Alexandre Antoine Davy de la Pailleterie, a French nobleman, and [[Marie-Cessette Dumas]], an African slave.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gallaher|first=John G.|title=General Alexandre Dumas: Soldier of the French Revolution|publisher=SIU Press|year=1997|pages=7–8|isbn= 978-0809320981}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Gates Jr.|first=Henry Louis|author-link=Henry Louis Gates Jr.|title=100 Amazing Facts about the Negro|publisher=[[Pantheon Books]]|year=2017|page=332|isbn=978-0307908711}}</ref> At age 14, Thomas-Alexandre was taken by his father to France, where he was educated in a military academy and entered the military for what became an illustrious career.

Dumas's father's aristocratic rank helped young Alexandre acquire work with [[Louis-Philippe I|Louis-Philippe, Duke of Orléans]], then as a writer, a career which led to early success. Decades later, after the election of [[Napoleon III of France|Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte]] in 1851, Dumas fell from favour and left France for Belgium, where he stayed for several years, then moved to Russia for a few years before going to Italy. In 1861, he founded and published the newspaper ''L'Indépendent'', which supported [[Italian unification]], before returning to Paris in 1864.

Though married, in the tradition of Frenchmen of higher social class, Dumas had numerous affairs (allegedly as many as 40). He was known to have had at least four illegitimate children, although twentieth-century scholars believe it was seven. He acknowledged and assisted his son, [[Alexandre Dumas fils|Alexandre Dumas]], to become a successful novelist and playwright. They are known as Alexandre Dumas [[Suffix (name)#Generational titles|{{lang|fr|père|nocat=y}}]] ('father') and Alexandre Dumas {{lang|fr|fils}} ('son'). Among his affairs, in 1866, Dumas had one with [[Adah Isaacs Menken]], an American actress then less than half his age and at the height of her career.

The English playwright [[Watts Phillips]], who knew Dumas in his later life, described him as "the most generous, large-hearted being in the world. He also was the most delightfully amusing and egotistical creature on the face of the earth. His tongue was like a windmill – once set in motion, you never knew when he would stop, especially if the theme was himself."<ref>[https://archive.org/details/wattsphillipsar01philgoog Watts Phillips: Artist and Playwright by Emma Watts Phillips. 1891] p. 63</ref>

<!-- this is more about the early life of his father than Alexandre himself -->Dumas Davy de la Pailleterie (later known as Alexandre Dumas) was born in 1802 in [[Villers-Cotterêts]] in the department of [[Aisne]], in [[Picardy]], France. He had two older sisters, Marie-Alexandrine (born 1794) and Louise-Alexandrine (1796–1797).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=zZ-ALXkowCEC&pg=PA98 John G. Gallaher, ''General Alexandre Dumas: Soldier of the French Revolution''], Southern Illinois University, 1997, p. 98</ref> Their parents were Marie-Louise Élisabeth Labouret, the daughter of an innkeeper, and [[Thomas-Alexandre Dumas]].

Thomas-Alexandre had been born in the French colony of [[Saint-Domingue]] (now Haiti), the [[mixed-race]], natural son of the marquis Alexandre Antoine Davy de la Pailleterie, a [[French nobility|French nobleman]] and ''général commissaire'' in the artillery of the colony, and [[Marie-Cessette Dumas]], an enslaved woman of [[Afro-Caribbean]] ancestry. At the time of Thomas-Alexandre's birth, his father was impoverished. It is not known whether his mother was born in Saint-Domingue or in Africa, nor is it known from which African people her ancestors came.<ref>[http://www.dumaspere.com/pages/vie/biographie.html Claude Schopp], Société des Amis d'Alexandre Dumas – 1998–2008</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dumaspere.com/pages/vie/biographie.html |title=Alexandre Dumas > Sa vie > Biographie |publisher=Dumaspere.com |access-date=13 February 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100120030100/http://www.dumaspere.com/pages/vie/biographie.html| archive-date= 20 January 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>[http://marianne2.fr/-Le-metissage-rentre-au-Pantheon-_a40493.html "Le métissage rentre au Panthéon"]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216115051/http://marianne2.fr/-Le-metissage-rentre-au-Pantheon-_a40493.html |date=16 December 2008 }}

Brought as a boy to France by his father and legally freed there, Thomas-Alexandre Dumas Davy was educated in a military school and joined the army as a young man. As an adult, Thomas-Alexandre used his mother's name, Dumas, as his surname after a break with his father. Dumas was promoted to general by the age of 31, the first soldier of Afro-Antilles origin to reach that rank in the French army.<ref>[http://www.general-dumas.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=47&Itemid=57 "L'association des Amis du Général Alexandre Dumas"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029192846/http://www.general-dumas.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=47&Itemid=57 |date=29 October 2013 }}, Website, accessed 11 August 2012.</ref>

[[File:Alexandre Dumas par Achille Devéria (1829).png|thumb|upright|''Alexandre Dumas'' by [[Achille Devéria]] (1829)]]
While working for Louis-Philippe, Dumas began writing articles for magazines and plays for the theatre. As an adult, he used his slave grandmother's surname of Dumas, as his father had done as an adult.<ref name="Webster"/> His first play, ''Henry III and His Courts'', produced in 1829 when he was 27 years old, met with acclaim. The next year, his second play, ''Christine'', was equally popular. These successes gave him sufficient income to write full-time.

In 1830, Dumas participated in the [[July Revolution|Revolution]] that ousted [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] and replaced him with Dumas's former employer, the [[Duke of Orléans]], who ruled as [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe]], the Citizen King. Until the mid-1830s, life in France remained unsettled, with sporadic riots by disgruntled Republicans and impoverished urban workers seeking change. As life slowly returned to normal, the nation began to industrialise. An improving economy combined with the end of press censorship made the times rewarding for Alexandre Dumas's literary skills.

After writing additional successful plays, Dumas switched to writing novels. Although attracted to an extravagant lifestyle and always spending more than he earned, Dumas proved to be an astute marketer. As newspapers were publishing many serial novels. His first serial novel was ''La Comtesse de Salisbury; Édouard III'' (July-September 1836). In 1838, Dumas rewrote one of his plays as a successful serial novel, ''Le Capitaine Paul''. He founded a production studio, staffed with writers who turned out hundreds of stories, all subject to his personal direction, editing, and additions. From 1839 to 1841, Dumas, with the assistance of several friends, compiled ''Celebrated Crimes'', an eight-volume collection of essays on famous criminals and crimes from European history. He featured [[Beatrice Cenci]], [[Martin Guerre]], [[Cesare Borgia|Cesare]] and [[Lucrezia Borgia]], as well as more recent events and criminals, including the cases of the alleged murderers [[Karl Ludwig Sand]] and [[Antoine François Desrues]], who were [[Capital punishment|executed]]. Dumas collaborated with Augustin Grisier, his [[fencing]] master, in his 1840 novel, ''The Fencing Master''. The story is written as Grisier's account of how he came to witness the events of the [[Decembrist revolt]] in Russia. The novel was eventually banned in Russia by Czar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]], and Dumas was prohibited from visiting the country until after the Czar's death. Dumas refers to Grisier with great respect in ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'', ''[[The Corsican Brothers]]'', and in his memoirs.

Dumas depended on numerous assistants and collaborators, of whom [[Auguste Maquet]] was the best known. It was not until the late twentieth century that his role was fully understood.<ref name="Samuel">{{cite news | last= Samuel| first= Henry | url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/7198679/Alexandre-Dumas-novels-penned-by-fourth-musketeer-ghost-writer.html |title= Alexandre Dumas novels penned by 'fourth musketeer' ghost writer | newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date= 10 February 2010 | access-date= 11 August 2012}}</ref> Dumas wrote the short novel ''Georges'' (1843), which uses ideas and plots later repeated in ''The Count of Monte Cristo''. Maquet took Dumas to court to try to get authorial recognition and a higher rate of payment for his work. He was successful in getting more money, but not a by-line.<ref name="Samuel"/><ref>See [[Andrew Lang]]'s essay, "Alexandre Dumas", in his ''Essays in Little'' (1891), for a full description of these collaborations.</ref>

Dumas's novels were so popular that they were soon translated into English and other languages. His writing earned him a great deal of money, but he was frequently insolvent, as he spent lavishly on women and sumptuous living. (Scholars have found that he had a total of 40 mistresses.<ref name="Crace"/>) In 1846, he had built a country house outside Paris at [[Le Port-Marly]], the large [[Château de Monte-Cristo]], with an additional building for his writing studio. It was often filled with strangers and acquaintances who stayed for lengthy visits and took advantage of his generosity. Two years later, faced with financial difficulties, he sold the entire property.

Dumas wrote in a wide variety of genres and published a total of 100,000 pages in his lifetime.<ref name="Hamel"/> He also made use of his experience, writing travel books after taking journeys, including those motivated by reasons other than pleasure. Dumas travelled to Spain, Italy, [[Germany]], England and [[French Algeria]]. After King Louis-Philippe was ousted in a revolt, [[Napoleon III of France|Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte]] was elected president. As Bonaparte disapproved of the author, Dumas fled in 1851 to [[Brussels]], Belgium, which was also an effort to escape his creditors. In about 1859, he moved to [[Russian Empire|Russia]], where French was the second language of the elite and his writings were enormously popular. Dumas spent two years in Russia and visited [[St. Petersburg]], [[Moscow]], [[Kazan]], [[Astrakhan]] and [[Tbilisi]], before leaving to seek different adventures. He published travel books about Russia.

In March 1861, the [[kingdom of Italy]] was proclaimed, with [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]] as its king. Dumas travelled there and for the next three years participated in the movement for [[Italian unification]]. He founded and led a newspaper, ''Indipendente''. While there, he befriended [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], whom he had long admired and with whom he shared a commitment to liberal [[Republicanism|republican]] principles as well as membership within [[Freemasonry]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Martone |first1=Eric |title=Italian Americans: The History and Culture of a People |date=2016 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=22}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Doumergue |first1=Christian |title=Franc-Maçonnerie & histoire de France |date=2016 |publisher=Ed. de l'Opportun |location=Paris |page=213}}</ref> Returning to Paris in 1864, he published travel books about Italy.

Despite Dumas's aristocratic background and personal success, he had to deal with discrimination related to his mixed-race ancestry. In 1843, he wrote a short novel, ''[[Georges (novel)|Georges]]'', that addressed some of the issues of race and the effects of colonialism. His response to a man who insulted him about his partial African ancestry has become famous. Dumas said:

==Personal life==
On 1 February 1840, Dumas married actress Ida Ferrier (born Marguerite-Joséphine Ferrand) (1811–1859).<ref name="bl">{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/features/blackeuro/pdf/dumas.pdf|date=19 August 2005|title=Alexander Dumas (1802 – 1870)|author=Mike Phillips|website=British Library Online|access-date=16 March 2018}}</ref> He had numerous liaisons with other women and was known to have fathered at least four children by them:
* [[Alexandre Dumas, fils|Alexandre Dumas, {{lang|fr|fils|nocat=y}}]] (1824–1895), son of Marie-Laure-Catherine Labay (1794–1868), a [[dressmaker]]. He became a successful novelist and playwright.
* Marie-Alexandrine Dumas (1831–1878), the daughter of Belle Krelsamer (1803–1875).
* Micaëlla-Clélie-Josepha-Élisabeth Cordier (born 1860), the daughter of Emélie Cordier.
* Henry Bauer, the son of a woman whose surname was Bauer.

About 1866, Dumas had an affair with [[Adah Isaacs Menken]], a well-known American actress. She had performed her sensational role in ''[[Mazeppa (play)|Mazeppa]]'' in London. In Paris, she had a sold-out run of ''[[Les Pirates de la Savanne]]'' and was at the peak of her success.<ref name="Haralson">[https://books.google.com/books?id=IKped0j8PXwC&pg=PA294&dq=menken&f=false#v=onepage&q=menken&f=false Dorsey Kleitz, "Adah Isaacs Menken"], in ''Encyclopedia of American Poetry: The Nineteenth Century'', ed. by Eric L. Haralson, pp. 294–296 (1998) ({{ISBN|978-1-57958-008-7}})</ref>

These women were among Dumas's nearly 40 mistresses found by scholar Claude Schopp, in addition to three natural children.<ref name="Crace"/>

Along with [[Victor Hugo]], [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Gérard de Nerval]], [[Eugène Delacroix]] and [[Honoré de Balzac]], Dumas was a member of the [[Club des Hashischins]], which met monthly to take [[hashish]] at a hotel in Paris. Dumas's "[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]" contains several references to hashish.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Komp |first1=Ellen |title=Alexandre Dumas |url=https://www.veryimportantpotheads.com/dumas.html |website=Very Important Potheads |access-date=8 August 2019}}</ref>

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Alexandre Dumas and Georgia national costumes 2002.jpg|thumb|upright|Postal stamp of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Dumas visited the [[Caucasus]] in 1858–1859]]
On 5 December 1870, Dumas died at the age of 68 of natural causes, possibly a heart attack. At his death in December 1870, Dumas was buried at his birthplace of [[Villers-Cotterêts]] in the department of [[Aisne]]. His death was overshadowed by the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. Changing literary fashions decreased his popularity. In the late twentieth century, scholars such as Reginald Hamel and Claude Schopp have caused a critical reappraisal and new appreciation of his art, as well as finding lost works.<ref name="Hamel"/>

In 1970, the [[Alexandre Dumas (Paris Métro)|Alexandre Dumas Paris Métro]] station was named in his honour. His country home outside Paris, the [[Château de Monte-Cristo]], has been restored and is open to the public as a museum.<ref name="Chateau Museum">[https://www.chateau-monte-cristo.com/main/en/horaires-et-tarifs-en/opening-times-high-season/ Château de Monte-Cristo Museum Opening Hours], accessed 4 November 2018.</ref>

Researchers have continued to find Dumas works in archives, including the five-act play ''[[The Gold Thieves]],'' found in 2002 by the scholar {{Interlanguage link multi|Réginald Hamel|fr}} in the [[Bibliothèque Nationale de France]]. It was published in France in 2004 by Honoré-Champion.<ref name="Hamel">[http://www.iforum.umontreal.ca/ForumExpress/Archives/vol4no1en/article02_ang.html French Studies: "Quebecer discovers an unpublished manuscript by Alexandre Dumas"], ''iForum'', University of Montreal, 30 September 2004, accessed 11 August 2012.</ref>

Frank Wild Reed (1874–1953), a [[New Zealand]] pharmacist who never visited France, amassed the greatest collection of books and manuscripts relating to Dumas outside France. The collection contains about 3,350 volumes, including some 2,000 sheets in Dumas's handwriting and dozens of French, Belgian and English first editions. The collection was donated to [[Auckland Libraries]] after his death.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/dbtw-wpd/virt-exhib/realgold/Literature/dumas.html | title=Real gold : treasures of Auckland City Libraries | publisher=[[Auckland University Press]] | author=Sharp, Iain | author-link=Iain Sharp | year=2007 | isbn=978-1-86940-396-6}}</ref> Reed wrote the most comprehensive bibliography of Dumas.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cadytech.com/dumas/related/bibliographies_reeds_labour_of_love.php | title=Bibliographies: Reed's 'Labour of Love' | publisher=CadyTech | work=The Alexandre Dumas père Web Site | date=1996 | access-date=25 July 2015 | author=Kerr, Donald}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cadytech.com/dumas/personnage.php?key=11| title=Reed, Frank Wild | publisher=CadyTech | work=The Alexandre Dumas père Web Site | access-date=25 July 2015 }}</ref>

In 2002, for the bicentenary of Dumas's birth, [[French Republic|French President]] [[Jacques Chirac]] held a ceremony honouring the author by having his ashes re-interred at the mausoleum of the [[The Panthéon|Panthéon of Paris]], where many French luminaries were buried.<ref name="Hamel"/><ref name="Crace"/> When President Jacques Chirac ordered the transfer to the mausoleum, villagers in Dumas' hometown of Villers-Cotterets initially opposed the transfer, saying Dumas laid out in his memoirs that he wanted to be buried there.
The village eventually bowed to the government's decision, and Dumas' body was exhumed from its cemetery and put into a new coffin in preparation for the transfer. <ref name= "AP">{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QQezHBtcpc&ab_channel=APArchive| title="Musketeers" author's coffin arrives at the Pantheon |work=AP Archive |location=France | date=21 July 2015 | access-date=15 February 2021 | author=Jordan, Taylor}}</ref> The proceedings were televised: the new coffin was draped in a blue velvet cloth and carried on a caisson flanked by four mounted [[Republican Guard (France)|Republican Guards]] costumed as the four [[Musketeer]]s.

In June 2005, Dumas's last novel, ''[[The Knight of Sainte-Hermine]]'', was published in France featuring the [[Battle of Trafalgar]]. Dumas described a fictional character killing [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Nelson]] (Nelson was shot and killed by an unknown sniper). Writing and publishing the novel serially in 1869, Dumas had nearly finished it before his death. It was the third part of the Sainte-Hermine trilogy.

Claude Schopp, a Dumas scholar, noticed a letter in an archive in 1990 that led him to discover the unfinished work. It took him years to research it, edit the completed portions, and decide how to treat the unfinished part. Schopp finally wrote the final two-and-a-half chapters, based on the author's notes, to complete the story.<ref name="Crace">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/may/06/highereducationprofile.academicexperts |title=Claude Schopp: The man who gave Dumas 40 mistresses |access-date=19 August 2008 |last=Crace |first=John |author-link=John Crace (writer)|date=6 May 2008 |work=The Guardian |location=UK | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080820091722/http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2008/may/06/highereducationprofile.academicexperts| archive-date= 20 August 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> Published by [[Éditions Phébus]], it sold 60,000 copies, making it a best seller. Translated into English, it was released in 2006 as ''[[The Last Cavalier]],'' and has been translated into other languages.<ref name="Crace"/>

Schopp has since found additional material related to the Sainte-Hermine saga. Schopp combined them to publish the sequel ''Le Salut de l'Empire'' in 2008.<ref name="Crace"/>

==== The Valois romances ====
The [[House of Valois|Valois]] were the royal house of France from 1328 to 1589, and many Dumas romances cover their reign. Traditionally, the so-called "Valois Romances" are the three that portray the Reign of [[Margaret of Valois|Queen Marguerite]], the last of the Valois. Dumas, however, later wrote four more novels that cover this family and portray similar characters, starting with François or [[Francis I of France|Francis I]], his son [[Henry II of France|Henry II]], and Marguerite and [[Francis II of France|François II]], sons of Henry II and [[Catherine de' Medici]].

===Drama===
Although best known now as a novelist, Dumas first earned fame as a dramatist. His ''Henri III et sa cour'' (1829) was the first of the great [[Romanticism|Romantic]] historical dramas produced on the Paris stage, preceding [[Victor Hugo]]'s more famous ''[[Hernani (drama)|Hernani]]'' (1830). Produced at the [[Comédie-Française]] and starring the famous [[Mademoiselle Mars]], Dumas's play was an enormous success and launched him on his career. It had fifty performances over the next year, extraordinary at the time. Dumas's works included:
* ''The Hunter and the Lover'' (1825)
* ''The Wedding and the Funeral'' (1826)
* ''Henry III and his court'' (1829)
* ''Christine – Stockholm, Fontainebleau, and Rome'' (1830)
* ''Napoleon Bonaparte or Thirty Years of the History of France'' (1831)
* ''Antony'' (1831){{snd}}a drama with a contemporary [[Byronic]] hero{{snd}}is considered the first non-historical Romantic drama. It starred Mars' great rival [[Marie Dorval]].
* ''Charles VII at the Homes of His Great Vassals'' (''Charles VII chez ses grands vassaux'', 1831). This drama was adapted by the Russian composer [[César Cui]] for his opera ''[[The Saracen (opera)|The Saracen]]''.
* ''Teresa'' (1831)
* ''La Tour de Nesle'' (1832), a historical [[melodrama]]
* ''The Memories of Anthony'' (1835)
* ''The Chronicles of France: Isabel of Bavaria'' (1835)
* ''[[Kean (play)|Kean]]'' (1836), based on the life of the notable late English actor [[Edmund Kean]]. [[Frédérick Lemaître]] played him in the production.
* ''Caligula'' (1837)
* ''Miss Belle-Isle'' (1837)
* ''The Young Ladies of Saint-Cyr'' (1843)
* ''The Youth of Louis XIV'' (1854)
* ''The Son of the Night – The Pirate'' (1856) (with Gérard de Nerval, Bernard Lopez, and Victor Sejour)
* ''[[The Gold Thieves]]'' (after 1857): an unpublished five-act play. It was discovered in 2002 by the Canadian scholar Reginald Hamel, who was researching in the [[Bibliothèque Nationale de France]]. The play was published in France in 2004 by Honoré-Champion. Hamel said that Dumas was inspired by a novel written in 1857 by his mistress Célèste de Mogador.<ref name="Hamel"/>

Dumas wrote many plays and adapted several of his novels as dramas. In the 1840s, he founded the [[Théâtre Historique]], located on the [[Boulevard du Temple]] in Paris. The building was used after 1852 by the [[Opéra National]] (established by [[Adolphe Adam]] in 1847). It was renamed the [[Théâtre Lyrique]] in 1851.

===Nonfiction===
Dumas was a prolific writer of nonfiction. He wrote journal articles on politics and culture and books on French history.

His lengthy ''Grand Dictionnaire de cuisine'' (''Great Dictionary of Cuisine'') was published posthumously in 1873. A combination of encyclopaedia and cookbook, it reflects Dumas's interests as both a gourmet and an expert cook. An abridged version (the ''Petit Dictionnaire de cuisine'', or ''Small Dictionary of Cuisine'') was published in 1883.

He was also known for his travel writing. These books included:
* ''Impressions de voyage: En Suisse'' (''Travel Impressions: In Switzerland'', 1834)
* ''Une Année à Florence'' (''A Year in [[Florence]]'', 1841)
* ''De Paris à Cadix'' (''From Paris to [[Cadiz]]'', 1847)
* ''Montevideo, ou une nouvelle Troie'', 1850 (''[[The New Troy]]''), inspired by the [[Great Siege of Montevideo]]

== Dumas Society ==
French historian [[Alain Decaux]] founded the "Société des Amis d'Alexandre Dumas" (The Society of Friends of Alexandre Dumas) in 1971. {{As of|2017|8}} its president is Claude Schopp.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dumaspere.com/pages/english/societe/sommaire.html |title=Alexandre Dumas |website=www.dumaspere.com|access-date=22 August 2017}}</ref> The purpose in creating this society was to preserve the Château de Monte-Cristo, where the society is currently located.
