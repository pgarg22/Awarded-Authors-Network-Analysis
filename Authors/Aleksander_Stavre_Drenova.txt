'''Aleksandër Stavre Drenova''' ({{IPA-sq|alɛkˈsandəɾ staˈvɾɛ dɾɛˈnova|pron}}; 11 April 1872{{snds}}11 December 1947), commonly known by the [[pen name]] '''Asdreni''', was an [[Albanians|Albanian]] poet, [[rilindas]], translator, writer and the author of the poem which later became the [[national anthem]] of [[Albania]].<ref>{{cite web |author1=Robert Elsie |author-link1=Robert Elsie |title=MODERN ALBANIAN LITERATURE AND ITS RECEPTION IN THE ENGLISH-SPEAKING WORLD |url=http://www.elsie.de/pdf/articles/A2005AlbWritingEnglTrans.pdf |website=elsie.de |pages=6–7 }}</ref><ref name="Anthem">{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/vaso_tole/Albanian/NationAnthem-AL.html |title=Himni kombëtar |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=26 October 2009 |access-date=25 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026231048/http://geocities.com/vaso_tole/Albanian/NationAnthem-AL.html |archive-date=26 October 2009 }}</ref> He is regarded as one of the most influential [[Albanian literature|Albanian writers]] of the 20th century and composed most of his [[Albanian Renaissance]]-inspired known works during that period. 
 
Born in the village of [[Drenovë]], Asdreni completed his academic studies at the [[University of Bucharest]] in Romania where he enthusiastically committed himself to the [[Declaration of independence of Albania|Independence of Albania]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref name="Elsie 2">{{cite book |author1=Robert Elsie |author-link1=Robert Elsie |title=Albanian Literature: A Short History |publisher=I.B.Tauris, 2005 |isbn=9781845110314 |language=en |chapter=5}}</ref> He maintained close liaison with fellow [[Gjergj Fishta]] and [[Lasgush Poradeci]] and was notably inspired by the patriots [[Girolamo de Rada]] and [[Naim Frashëri]].
 
''Rreze dielli'', a collection of 99 poems, was his first prominent work which he dedicated to the national hero of Albania [[Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg]]. Devoted to [[Edith Durham]] a friend of Albania, his second collection of again 99 poems, ''Ëndrra e lotë'', displayed a wider range of themes and motifs as well as his more astonishing maturity.

== Life and career ==
Asdreni was born as Aleksandër Stavre Drenova on 11 April 1872 into an [[Albanian people|Albanian]] peasant family of [[Albanian Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] faith in the village of [[Drenovë]] close to the city of [[Korçë]] in what was then part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and is now [[Albania]].<ref name="Elsie 2"/><ref name="Pipa">{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Let%C3%ABrsia_Shqipe.html?id=kdfaoQEACAAJ |title=Trilogia Albanica III: Albanian Literature: Social Perspectives|publisher=Princi|author1=Arshi Pipa|author-link1=Arshi Pipa|year=2014|pages=112|trans-title=Trilogjia Albanika III: Letërsia shqipe: Perspektiva shoqërore|isbn=978-9928-4090-9-6|orig-year=1978|translator=Primo Shllaku}}</ref> In his native village he properly received his early formal education at a Greek primary school and had just started secondary school in Korçë subsequently his father, Stavri Thimiu, died leaving him fatherless.<ref name="Elsie">{{Cite book|title=Histori e Letërsisë Shqiptare|author1=Robert Elsie |author-link1=Robert Elsie|publisher=Dukagjini|year=1997|location=Tiranë-Pejë|pages=179–180|translator=Abdurrahman Myftiu}}</ref> 

The surrounding region Korçë had been a prime source of [[Albanian diaspora|Albanian migration]] which was additionally strengthened by an earthquake in 1879.<ref name="Elsie 2"/> He consequently migrated to [[Bucharest]] in 1885 and rejoined his more elderly brothers where he also commenced his short-living studies at the Faculty of Political Science of the [[University of Bucharest]].<ref name="Elsie 2"/> 

In the new country, Asdreni came into liaison with other [[Albanians of Romania|Albanian]] intellectuals and writers with whom he started to strengthen the [[Albanian diaspora]] in Romania for the struggle of national liberation.<ref name="Elsie 2"/> Prior to that, he was strongly inspired by [[Girolamo de Rada]] and [[Naim Frashëri]] as well as by the [[Albanian Renaissance]] in which the Albanians came to acknowledge themselves as a nation deserving the right to govern themselves.

== Writings and publication ==
[[File:Lasgush Poradeci, Ernest Koliqi, At Gjergj Fishta and Asdreni.jpg|thumb|upright|Asdreni with his fellows [[Lasgush Poradeci]], [[Ernest Koliqi]] and [[Gjergj Fishta]]. They are all among the most influential Albanian writers of the 20th century.]]

The literary career of Asdreni blossomed simultaneously with the beginning of the 20th century. In his first work, a collection of 99 poems known as the ''Rreze dielli'' dedicated to the Albanian [[Hero of Albania|national hero]] [[Gjergj Kastriot Skanderbeg|Skanderbeg]] who led a successful [[Skanderbeg's rebellion|resistance]] to Ottoman expansion into Europe, he followed the literary traditions of [[Naim Frashëri]] and raised his love for the motherland encouraging his compatriots to enter the struggle for [[Albanian Declaration of Independence|liberation]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref name="Elsie 2"/>

''Ëndrra e lotë'', his second work also composed of 99 poems dedicated to [[Edith Durham]] who travelled extensively across Albania, is characterised by a wealth of poetic values. He instantly expressed his democratic values, his interests in societal problems at the time as well as his critical discourses on foreign domination. It was an important step from [[Romanticism]] towards [[Realism (literature)|Realism]] which was characterised by the historical time frame and reference, and writing about events and situations that happened in real life. 
 
His poem "Kënga e bashkimit" (The Song of Unity), published in the volume Ëndrra [dh]e lotë ("Dreams and tears", 1912), is a clear adaptation of the Romanian song "[[Hora Unirii]]" by [[Vasile Alecsandri]].<ref>[[Robert Elsie]], Albanian literature: a short history, 2005, p. 104.</ref>
