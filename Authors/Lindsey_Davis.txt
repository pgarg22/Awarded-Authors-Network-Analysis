'''Lindsey Davis''' (born 1949) is an English [[historical novel]]ist, best known as the author of the [[Marcus Didius Falco|Falco]] series of [[historical mystery|historical crime stories]] set in [[ancient Rome]] and its empire. She is a recipient of the [[Cartier Diamond Dagger]] award.

==Biography==
Davis was born in [[Birmingham]] and after taking a degree in [[English literature]] at [[Oxford University]] ([[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford|Lady Margaret Hall]]),<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/Alumni/Prominent-alumni.aspx | title=LMH, Oxford - Prominent Alumni|access-date=20 May 2015}}</ref> she became a [[Civil service|civil servant]]. She left the civil service after 13 years, and when a [[romantic novel]] she had written was runner up for the 1985 ''[[Georgette Heyer]] Historical Novel Prize'', she decided to become a writer, writing at first romantic serials for the UK women's magazine ''[[Woman's Realm]]''.

Her dedication of the book ''[[Rebels and Traitors]]'' (2009) reads:  "For Richard / dearest and closest of friends / your favourite book / in memory", and the author's website relates: "I am still getting used to life without my dear Richard. For those of you who haven't seen this before, he died in October [2008]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lindseydavis.co.uk/lindseyspage.htm |title=Lindsey's page |work=The Official Lindsey Davis Website |access-date=2009-09-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429084212/http://www.lindseydavis.co.uk/lindseyspage.htm |archive-date=2009-04-29 }}</ref>  The author says in her publisher's newsletter: "The greatest recommendation I can give is that Richard, its first reader, thought it wonderful. He devoured chunks, demanding ‘Bring more story!’ even when he was in hospital. One of the last things I was ever able to tell him was that ''Rebels and Traitors'' was to be published by Random House, so I would be working with dear friends for his favourite book."<ref name=news09>{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/lindsey_davis/issue9/Lindsey%20Newsletter.pdf|title=The Lindsey Davis Newsletter, no. 9|date=January 2009|work=Random House Publishing|access-date=2009-03-31}}</ref>

Davis suffered from the eye condition [[keratoconus]] from childhood, and in adulthood had a [[Corneal transplantation|corneal transplant]], about which she has said: "A stranger's generosity freed me from years of pain and anxiety", and urges her readers to carry a [[donor card]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Davis|first=Lindsey|title=Five-minute memoir: Lindsey Davis on life with her brand new eye|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/fiveminute-memoir-lindsey-davis-on-life-with-her-brand-new-eye-7618940.html|access-date=17 August 2012|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=7 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Lindsey's Page: Organ Donor Card Appeal |url=http://www.lindseydavis.co.uk/lindseyspage.htm |publisher=The Official Website of Lindsey Davis |access-date=17 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911103325/http://www.lindseydavis.co.uk/lindseyspage.htm |archive-date=11 September 2012 }}</ref>

==Writing==
Davis's interest in [[history]] and [[archaeology]] led to her writing an historical novel about [[Vespasian]] and his lover [[Antonia Caenis]] (''[[The Course of Honour]]''), for which she could not find a publisher. She tried again, and her first novel featuring the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] "[[detective]]", [[Marcus Didius Falco]], ''The Silver Pigs'' (1989), set in the same time period, was the start of her runaway success as a writer of [[historical whodunnit]]s.  A further 19 Falco novels have followed, as well as ''The Course of Honour'', which was finally published in 1997. ''[[Rebels and Traitors]]'', set in the period of the [[English Civil War]], was published in September 2009, and ''[[Falco: The Official Companion]]'' in June 2010. ''[[Master and God]]'', published in March 2012, is set in ancient Rome and concerning the emperor [[Domitian]].
In 2012, Davis and her publishers, [[Hodder & Stoughton]] in the UK and [[St. Martin's Press]] in the US, announced that she was writing a new series of books centred on [[Marcus Didius Falco#Flavia Albia|Flavia Albia]], Falco's British-born adopted daughter and "an established female investigator". The first title, ''[[The Ides of April]]'' was published on 11 April 2013 in the UK,<ref name=flavia>{{cite web|title=Lindsey's page: Next Book |url=http://www.lindseydavis.co.uk/lindseyspage.htm |publisher=The Official Website of Lindsey Davis |access-date=17 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911103325/http://www.lindseydavis.co.uk/lindseyspage.htm |archive-date=11 September 2012 }} ''(Copy of publishers' press release)''</ref> and its sequel, ''[[Enemies at Home]]'', was published in 2014,<ref name=ld-enemies>{{cite web|url = http://www.lindseydavis.co.uk/publications/enemies-at-home/|title = Enemies at Home|website = Lindsey Davis official website|access-date = 1 August 2013}}</ref> followed by annual additions, the latest {{as of|2020|lc=yes}} being ''[[The Grove of the Caesars]]''. In an interview in 2019 Davis discusses her successful plan to write a novel set on each of the [[seven hills of Rome]], starting with the [[Aventine Hill]] and culminating with the [[Capitoline Hill]].<ref name=hodder-interview />

Davis has won many literary awards, including in 2011 the [[Cartier Diamond Dagger]] of the Crime Writers' Association given to authors who have made an outstanding lifetime's contribution to the genre.<ref name=allen>{{cite news|last=Allen|first=Katie|title=Davis to be awarded Cartier Diamond Dagger Award|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/davis-be-awarded-cartier-diamond-dagger-award.html|access-date=26 January 2011|newspaper=[[The Bookseller]]|date=25 January 2011}}</ref> She was honorary president of the [[Classical Association]] from 1997 to 1998, and is a life member of the Council of the [[Society of Authors]].<ref name="soa">{{cite web |title=About: Council and President: Lindsey Davis |url=https://www.societyofauthors.org/About-Us/Council/Lindsey-Davis |website=www.societyofauthors.org |publisher=The Society of Authors |access-date=29 November 2021}}</ref>
