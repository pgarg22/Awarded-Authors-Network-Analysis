==The Aquasilva Trilogy==

*'''Heresy''' (2001) is set within the stormy waterworld of Aquasilva. Aquasilva is controlled by the Domain, a religious power dedicated to the element fire. The Domain, however, is confronted by many forces of change. One of these unknowing change agents is Cathan, son of the count from Lepidor. Upon discovering iron on their territory, Cathan leaves his home to inform his father of this important find. During his journey Cathan stumbles upon a plot to unleash a new age of fundamentalism. New friends and new powers enable Cathan to confront this extremism.
*'''Inquisition''' (2002) is the second volume in the Aquasilva Trilogy. After the battle that restored Lepidor to freedom, Cathan sets off on his travels again to find an answer to the storm-magic he used to save his clan. In the process he soon discovers a new secret that will change his life forever.
*'''Crusade''' (2003) is the final work in the Aquasilva Trilogy. In this book Cathan finally discovers who he is. At the same time, religious fanatics of the Domain continue to seek out heresy and Cathan in particular.
