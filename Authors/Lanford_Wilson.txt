'''Lanford Wilson''' (April 13, 1937{{spaced ndash}}March 24, 2011) was an American playwright. His work, as described by ''The New York Times'', was "earthy, realist, greatly admired [and] widely performed."<ref name="NYTimes1">[[Margalit Fox|Fox, Margalit]]. [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/25/theater/lanford-wilson-pulitzer-prize-winning-playwright-dies-at-73.html "Lanford Wilson, Pulitzer Prize-Winning Playwright, Dies at 73"] ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 24, 2011.</ref> Wilson helped to advance the [[Off-Off-Broadway]] theater movement with his earliest plays, which were first produced at the [[Caffe Cino]] beginning in 1964. He was one of the first playwrights to move from Off-Off-Broadway to [[Off-Broadway]], then [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and beyond.

He received the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] in 1980 and was elected in 2001 to the [[Theater Hall of Fame]]. In 2004, Wilson was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] and received the [[PEN/Laura Pels International Foundation for Theater Award]] as a Master American Dramatist. He was nominated for three [[Tony Awards]] and has won a [[Drama Desk Award]] and five [[Obie Awards]].

Wilson's 1964 short play ''[[The Madness of Lady Bright]]'' was his first major success and led to further works throughout the 1960s that expressed a variety of social and romantic themes. In 1969, he co-founded the [[Circle Repertory Company]] with theatre director [[Marshall W. Mason]]. He wrote many plays for the Circle Repertory in the 1970s. His 1973 play ''[[The Hot l Baltimore]]'' was the company's first major success with both audiences and critics. The Off-Broadway production exceeded 1,000 performances.

His play ''[[Fifth of July]]'' was first produced at Circle Repertory in 1978. He received a Tony Award nomination for its Broadway production, which opened in 1980. A prequel to ''Fifth of July'' called ''[[Talley's Folly]]'' (opened 1979 at Circle Repertory) opened on Broadway before ''Fifth of July'' and won Wilson the 1980 Pulitzer Prize for Drama and his first Tony nomination. ''[[Burn This]]'' (1987) was another Broadway success. Wilson also wrote the [[libretto|libretti]] for several operas.

==Childhood and education==
Wilson was born to Ralph Eugene and Violetta Tate Wilson in [[Lebanon, Missouri]]. After his parents divorced when he was 5, he moved with his mother to [[Springfield, Missouri]], where they lived until she remarried.<ref name="donshewey.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.donshewey.com/theater_articles/lanford_wilson.html|title=Lanford Wilson|website=Don Shewey}}</ref> When he was 11, his mother married Walt E.

==Early work (1962-1968)==
In 1962, Wilson moved to [[Greenwich Village]] in New York City. He worked in odd jobs, such as a temporary typist, a reservations clerk at [[Sheraton New York Times Square Hotel|Americana Hotel]], at the complaint desk of a furniture store, and at a dishwashing job where a co-worker incorrectly called him "Lance".<ref>Dean, p.&nbsp;17</ref> After that, Wilson's friends all called him by that name.<ref name="donshewey.com"/> Wilson eventually worked for the subscription office of the [[Shakespeare in the Park (New York City)|New York Shakespeare Festival]].<ref name="Dean, p.18">Dean, p.&nbsp;18.</ref>

Wilson first encountered the [[Caffe Cino]] when he went to see [[Eugène Ionesco]]'s ''[[The Lesson]]''. The experience left him thinking that theatre "could be both dangerous and funny in that way at the same time".<ref name="Dean, p.18"/> After the show, Wilson introduced himself to Cino co-founder and producer [[Joe Cino]], a pioneer of the Off-Off-Broadway movement.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://caffecino.wordpress.com/1939/01/01/lanford-wilson/|title=Lanford Wilson: The Mozart From Missouri|work=Caffe Cino Pictures|access-date=August 27, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>Williams, p.&nbsp;17.</ref><ref>Barnett, p.&nbsp;4.</ref> Cino encouraged Wilson to submit a play to the Cino. In Cino, Wilson found a mentor who would not only critique his plays, but also stage them.<ref name="Dean, p.18"/>

Wilson's first play to premiere at Cino was ''So Long at the Fair'', in August 1963.<ref name="Dean, p.18"/> His works for Caffe Cino include ''[[Ludlow Fair]]'' (originally titled ''Nail Polish and Tampons''), ''[[Home Free!]]'', and ''[[The Madness of Lady Bright]]''. He continued working odd jobs to support himself during these early years.<ref>Busby, p.&nbsp;8.</ref> ''The Madness of Lady Bright'' premiered at Caffe Cino in May&nbsp;1964. The play concerns "Lady" Bright, who is a forty-year-old "screaming preening queen". On a sultry summer day in the 1960s, while in his apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, "Lady" Bright slowly loses his mind. It is a complex and comic tragedy of striking originality, and one of Wilson's most notable and finest works. At its heart, the work is a penetrating study of loneliness and isolation. It was one of off-off-Broadway's first significant successes, running for over 200 performances.<ref>Barnett, p.&nbsp;14.</ref><ref name="Barnett5">Barnett, p.&nbsp;5.</ref> ''The Madness of Lady Bright'' set a record as the longest-running play at Caffe Cino.<ref name="Busby, p">Busby.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glreview.org/article/1964-the-birth-of-gay-theater/|title=1964 – The birth of gay theater|last=Blaney|first=Darren|date=December 29, 2013|website=[[Gay & Lesbian Review]]|access-date=August 27, 2018}}</ref>

Ben Brantley, theatre critic for ''The New York Times'', has said that Wilson's plays reflect "disenchantment with the state of the nation...A couple plays, at least, featured embittered Vietnam veterans.
