'''John Clare''' (13 July 1793 – 20 May 1864) was an English poet. The son of a farm labourer, he became known for his celebrations of the English countryside and sorrows at its disruption.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book |editor-first=Geoffrey |editor-last=Summerfield |title=Selected Poems |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |date=1990 |pages=13–22 |isbn=0-14-043724-X}}</ref> His work underwent major re-evaluation in the late 20th century; he is now often seen as a major 19th-century poet.<ref>{{Cite book |first=Roger |last=Sales |date=2002 |title=John Clare: A Literary Life |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |location=New York City |isbn=0-333-65270-3}}</ref> His biographer [[Jonathan Bate]] called Clare "the greatest labouring-class poet that England has ever produced.

==Life==
===Early life===
Clare was born in [[Helpston]], {{convert|6|mi|km|0}} to the north of the city of [[Peterborough]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-clare |title=John Clare |date=2019-08-25 |website=Poetry Foundation |language=en |access-date=2019-08-26}}</ref> In his lifetime, the village was in the [[Soke of Peterborough]] in Northamptonshire and his memorial calls him "The Northamptonshire Peasant Poet". Helpston is now part of the [[City of Peterborough]] [[unitary authority]].

Clare became an agricultural labourer while still a child, but attended school in [[Glinton, Cambridgeshire|Glinton]] church until he was 12. In his early adult years, Clare became a [[wikt:potboy|potboy]] in the ''Blue Bell'' public house and fell in love with Mary Joyce, but her father, a prosperous farmer, forbade them to meet. Later he was a gardener at [[Burghley House]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/features/besom-ling-and-teasel-burrs-john-clare-and-botanising |title='Besom ling and teasel burrs': John Clare and botanising |date=20 September 2014 |work=University of Cambridge |access-date=22 July 2018 |language=en}}</ref> He enlisted in the [[Militia (United Kingdom)|militia]], tried camp life with [[Gypsies]], and worked in [[Pickworth, Rutland]] as a [[Lime kiln#Early kilns|lime burner]] in 1817. In the following year he was obliged to accept [[Poor relief|parish relief]].<ref>Louis Untermeyer, in ''A Treasury of Great Poems, English and American, from the Foundations of the English Spirit to the Outstanding Poetry of our Own Time with Lives of the Poets and Historical Settings Selected and Integrated'', Simon and Schuster, 1942, p. 709.</ref> Malnutrition stemming from childhood may have been the main factor behind his five-foot stature and contributed to his poor physical health in later life.

===Early poems===
Clare had bought a copy of [[James Thomson (poet)|James Thomson]]'s ''[[The Seasons (Thomson poem)|The Seasons]]'' and began to write poems and sonnets. In an attempt to hold off his parents' eviction from their home, Clare offered his poems to a local bookseller, Edward Drury, who sent them to his cousin, [[John Taylor (English publisher)|John Taylor]] of the Taylor & Hessey firm, which had published the work of [[John Keats]]. Taylor published Clare's ''Poems Descriptive of Rural Life and Scenery'' in 1820. The book was highly praised and the next year his ''Village Minstrel and Other Poems'' appeared. "There was no limit to the applause bestowed upon Clare, unanimous in their admiration of a poetical genius coming before them in the humble garb of a farm labourer."<ref>{{Cite book |first=Frederick |last=Martin |chapter=Preface |title=Life of John Clare |publisher=BiblioLife |location=London, England |orig-year=1865 |date=2010 |isbn=978-1140143451}}</ref>

===Middle life===
[[File:John Clare's birthplace, Helpston, Peterborough - geograph.org.uk - 217344.jpg|thumb|right|Clare's birthplace, [[Helpston]], [[Peterborough]]. The cottage was subdivided with his family renting a part.]]
On 16 March 1820 Clare married Martha ("Patty") Turner, a [[milkmaid]], in the [[Church of St Peter and St Paul, Great Casterton|Church of St Peter and St Paul]] in [[Great Casterton]].<ref>E. Robinson, 2004: "Clare, John (1793–1864)...", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''. [https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-5441. Retrieved 25 July 2019]</ref> An annuity of 15 [[guineas]] from the [[Brownlow Cecil, 2nd Marquess of Exeter|Marquess of Exeter]], in whose service he had been, was supplemented by subscription, so that Clare gained £45 a year, a sum far beyond what he had ever earned. Soon, however, his income became insufficient and in 1823 he was nearly penniless. ''The Shepherd's Calendar'' (1827) met with little success, which was not increased by his [[Hawker (trade)|hawking]] it himself. As he worked again in the fields his health temporarily improved; but he soon became seriously ill. [[William Fitzwilliam, 4th Earl Fitzwilliam|Earl Fitzwilliam]] presented him with a new cottage and a piece of ground, but Clare could not settle down there.

Clare was constantly torn between the two worlds of literary London and his often illiterate neighbours, between a need to write poetry and a need for money to feed and clothe his children. His health began to suffer and he had bouts of depression, which worsened after his sixth child was born in 1830 and as his poetry sold less well. In 1832, his friends and London patrons clubbed together to move the family to a larger cottage with a [[smallholding]] in the village of [[Northborough, Cambridgeshire|Northborough]], not far from Helpston. However, he only felt more alienated there.

Clare's last work, the ''Rural Muse'' (1835), was noticed favourably by [[John Wilson (Scottish writer)|Christopher North]] and other reviewers, but its sales were not enough to support his wife and seven children. Clare's mental health began to worsen. His alcohol consumption steadily increased along with dissatisfaction with his own identity and more erratic behaviour. A notable instance was his interruption of a performance of ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', in which Clare verbally assaulted [[Shylock]]. He was becoming a burden to Patty and his family, and in July 1837, on the recommendation of his publishing friend, John Taylor, Clare went of his own volition (accompanied by a friend of Taylor's) to Dr Matthew Allen's private asylum [[High Beach]] near [[Loughton]], in [[Epping Forest]]. Taylor had assured Clare that he would receive the best medical care.

Clare was reported as being "full of many strange delusions". He believed himself to be a [[boxing|prize fighter]] and that he had two wives, Patty and Mary. He started to claim he was [[Lord Byron]]. Allen wrote about Clare to ''[[The Times]]'' in 1840:
<blockquote> 
It is most singular that ever since he came... the moment he gets pen or pencil in hand he begins to write most poetical effusions. Yet he has never been able to obtain in conversation, nor even in writing prose, the appearance of sanity for two minutes or two lines together, and yet there is no indication of insanity in any of his poetry.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/healthadvice/bookreviews/books/johnclare/review1.aspx |title=Review 1 |publisher=Rcpsych.ac.uk |date=27 July 2007 |access-date=27 February 2015}}</ref>
</blockquote>

===Religion===
Clare was an [[Anglican]].<ref>Sarah Houghton-Walker, in ''John Clare's Religion'', Routledge, p. 6.</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Clare |first=John |title=The Parish |url=https://archive.org/details/parishsatire00clar |url-access=registration |publisher=Penguin |year=1986 |isbn=0670801127 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/parishsatire00clar/page/n82 6]–8}}</ref> Whatever he may have felt about liturgy and ministry, and however critical an eye he may have cast on parish life, Clare retained and replicated his father's loyalty to the [[Church of England]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Houghton-Walker |first=Sarah |title=John Clare's Religion |publisher=Routledge |year=2009 |isbn= 978-0754665144 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6z8fDAAAQBAJ |page=11}}</ref> He dodged services in his youth and dawdled in the fields during the hours of worship, but he derived much help in later years from members of the clergy. He acknowledged that his father "was brought up in the communion of the Church of England, and I have found no cause to withdraw myself from it." If he found aspects of the established church uncongenial and awkward, he remained prepared to defend it: "Still I reverence the church and do from my soul as much as anyone curse the hand that's lifted to undermine its constitution."<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Salter |first1=Roger |title=A Christian Consideration of John Clare – English Poet (1793–1864) |url=http://www.virtueonline.org/christian-consideration-john-clare-english-poet-1793-1864 |website=Virtueonline.org |access-date=24 April 2018}}</ref>

Much of Clare's imagery was drawn from the [[Old Testament]] (e.g. "The Peasant Poet"). However, Clare also honours the figure of [[Christ]] in poems such as "The Stranger".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.poemist.com/john-clare/the-stranger |title=The Stranger by John Clare &#124; Poemist |website=Poemist.com |access-date=27 October 2021}}</ref>

===Later life===
[[File:Grave John Clare.jpg|thumb|Clare's grave in Helpston churchyard]]
During his early asylum years in [[High Beach]], Essex (1837–1841),<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/romantics/clare.shtml |title=BBC - Arts - Romantics |website=Bbc.co.uk |access-date=27 October 2021}}</ref> Clare re-wrote poems and sonnets by [[Lord Byron]]. ''Child Harold'', his version of Byron's ''[[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage]]'', became a lament for past lost love, and ''Don Juan, A Poem'' an acerbic, misogynistic, sexualised rant redolent of an ageing dandy.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} Clare also took credit for [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s plays, claiming to be him. "I'm John Clare now," the poet told a newspaper editor, "I was Byron and Shakespeare formerly."{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}

In July 1841, Clare absconded from the asylum in Essex and walked some {{convert|80|mi|km}} home, believing he was to meet his first love Mary Joyce, to whom he was convinced he was married.<ref>Macfarlane, Robert (1 July 2021). "The Landscapes Inside Us". ''The New York Review of Books''. '''68''' (11): 25–27.</ref> He did not believe her family when they told him she had died accidentally three years earlier in a house fire. He remained free, mostly at home in Northborough, for the five months following, but eventually Patty called the doctors.

Between Christmas and New Year, 1841, Clare was committed to Northampton General Lunatic Asylum (now [[St Andrew's Hospital]]).<ref>{{Cite web |title='The borough of Northampton: Description', in A History of the County of Northampton |volume=3 |first=William |last=Page |location=London, 1930 |pages=30–40 |publisher=British History Online |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/northants/vol3/pp30-40 |access-date=17 July 2021}}</ref> On his arrival at the asylum, the accompanying doctor, [[Fenwick Skrimshire]], having treated Clare since 1820,<ref>Geoffrey Summerfield, Hugh Haughton, Adam Phillips, ''John Clare in Context'', Cambridge University Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-521-44547-7}}, p. 263.</ref> completed the admission papers. Asked, "Was the insanity preceded by any severe or long-continued mental emotion or exertion?" Dr Skrimshire entered: "After years of poetical prosing."<ref>Margaret Grainger, ed., ''The Natural History Prose Writings of John Clare'', Oxford English Texts, Oxford University Press, 1983, {{ISBN|0-19-818517-0}}, p. 34.</ref>

His maintenance at the asylum was paid for by Earl Fitzwilliam, "but at the ordinary rate for poor people".<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/8672/pg8672.txt |title=Poems Chiefly From Manuscript |last=Clare |first=John |publisher=GUTENBERG EBOOK |editor-last=Blunden, Porter}}</ref> He remained there for the rest of his life under the humane regime of Dr [[Thomas Octavius Prichard]], who encouraged and helped him to write. Here he wrote possibly his most famous poem, "[[I Am (poem)|I Am]]".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Martin |first=Frederick |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8470 |title=The Life of John Clare |date=1865 |publisher=Project Gutenberg |publication-date=2005-07-01 |language=en}}</ref> It was in this later poetry that Clare "developed a very distinctive voice, an unmistakable intensity and vibrance, such as the later pictures of Van Gogh" possessed.<ref name=":1"/>

John Clare died of a stroke on 20 May 1864 in his 71st year.<ref name=":0"/> His remains were returned to Helpston for burial in St Botolph's churchyard, where he had expressed a wish to be buried.<ref name=":0"/>

===Remembrance===
On Clare's birthday, children at the John Clare School, Helpston's primary, parade through the village and place their "midsummer cushions" around his gravestone, which bears the inscriptions "To the Memory of John Clare The Northamptonshire Peasant Poet" and "A Poet is Born not Made".<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.stamfordmercury.co.uk/news/Festival-celebrated-poet39s-life-and.4288056.jp |title=Festival celebrated poet's life and work |newspaper=Rutland and Stamford Mercury |date=15 July 2008 |access-date=15 August 2012}}</ref>

==Poetry==
[[File:John Clare Memorial, Helpston, Peterborough - geograph.org.uk - 87487.jpg|thumb|right|John Clare memorial, [[Helpston]]]]
In his time, Clare was commonly known as "the [[Northamptonshire]] Peasant Poet". His formal education was brief, his other employment and class origins lowly. Clare resisted the use of the increasingly standardised English grammar and [[orthography]] in his poetry and prose, alluding to political reasoning in comparing "grammar" (in a wider sense of orthography) to tyrannical government and slavery, personifying it in jocular fashion as a "bitch".<ref>Asked by his cousin and publisher [[John Taylor (English publisher)|John Taylor]] to correct a passage for publication, he answered: "I may alter but I cannot mend – grammer in learning is like tyranny in government – confound the bitch ill never be her slave & have a vast good mind not to alter the verse in question...." (Letter 133). See {{Cite book |editor1-last=Storey |editor1-first=Edward |title=The Letters of John Clare |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |year=1985 |page=231 |isbn=9780198126690 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lnRaAAAAMAAJ&q=bitch}}</ref> He wrote in Northamptonshire dialect, introducing local words to the literary canon such as "pooty" (snail), "lady-cow" ([[Coccinellidae|ladybird]]), "crizzle" (to crisp) and "throstle" ([[song thrush]]).

In early life he struggled to find a place for his poetry in the changing literary fashions of the day. He also felt that he did not belong with other peasants. As Clare once wrote:<blockquote>
"I live here among the ignorant like a lost man in fact like one whom the rest seemes careless of having anything to do with—they hardly dare talk in my company for fear I should mention them in my writings and I find more pleasure in wandering the fields than in musing among my silent neighbours who are insensible to everything but toiling and talking of it and that to no purpose."
</blockquote>

It is common to see an absence of punctuation in Clare's original writings, although many publishers felt the need to remedy this in most of his work. Clare argued with his editors about how it should be presented to the public.

Clare grew up in a time of massive changes in town and countryside as the [[Industrial Revolution]] swept Europe. Many former agricultural and craft workers, including children, moved from the countryside to crowded cities, as factory work mechanized. The [[British Agricultural Revolution|Agricultural Revolution]] saw pastures ploughed up, trees and hedges uprooted, fens drained and commons [[Enclosure|enclosed]]. This destruction of an ancient way of life distressed Clare. His political and social views were mainly conservative. ("I am as far as my politics reaches 'King and Country' – no Innovations in Religion and Government say I.") He refused even to complain of the subordinate position to which English society had placed him, swearing that "with the old dish that was served to my forefathers I am content."<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Manjoo |first=Farhad |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2089950/ |title=Man Out of Time by Christopher Caldwell |magazine=Slate |date=17 October 2003 |access-date=15 August 2012}}</ref>

His early work expresses delight in nature and the cycle of the rural year. Poems such as "Winter Evening", "Haymaking" and "Wood Pictures in Summer" mark the beauty of the world and the certainties of rural life, where animals must be fed and crops harvested. Poems such as "Little Trotty Wagtail" show his sharp observation of wildlife, though "The Badger" shows a lack of sentiment about the place of animals in the countryside. At this time he often used poetic forms such as the sonnet and the rhyming couplet. His later poetry tends to be more meditative and use forms similar to the folk songs and ballads of his youth. An example of this is "Evening".

Clare's knowledge of the natural world went far beyond that of the major [[Romantic poetry|Romantic]] poets. However, poems such as "I Am" show a [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] depth parallel with his contemporary poets and many of his pre-asylum poems deal with intricate play on the nature of linguistics. His "bird's nest poems", it can be argued, display the self-awareness and obsession with the creative process that captivated the romantics. Clare was the most influential poet, apart from [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]], to prefer an older style.<ref>{{Cite book |first=Alastair |last=Fowler |author-link=Alastair Fowler |year=1989 |title=The History of English Literature |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |page=250 |isbn=0-674-39664-2}}</ref>

In a foreword to the 2011 anthology ''The Poetry of Birds'', the broadcaster and bird-watcher Tim Dee notes that Clare wrote about 147 species of British wild birds "without any technical kit whatsoever".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/features/poet-activist-bird-watcher-exploring-john-clare-as-nature-writer |title=Poet, activist, bird watcher: exploring John Clare as nature writer |date=29 August 2017 |access-date=24 April 2018}}</ref>

==Essays==
The only Clare essay to appear in his lifetime was "Popularity of Authorship", which described anonymously his predicament in 1824.<ref>[[John Birtwhistle]], "Occasion of the Essay" [http://www.johnclare.info/birtwhistle.htm info]</ref><ref>"Popularity of Authorship'(1824)", ''European Magazine'', vol. 1, No. 3, New Series, November 1825.</ref> Other essays by Clare to appear posthumously were "Essays on Landscape", "Essays on Criticism and Fashion", "Recollections on a Journey from Essex", "Excursions with an Angler", "For Essay on Modesty and Mock Morals", "For Essay on Industry", "Keats", "Byron", "The Dream", "House or Window Flies" and "Dewdrops".<ref>''Complete Works of John Clare (Illustrated)'', Delphi Poets Series version 1 2013 [https://books.google.com/books?id=MXQbAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT1461&lpg=PT1461&dq=essays+by+john+clare&source=bl&ots=yY71yCIE3I&sig=27hlcNBsY6pe0m9mB2Vq_dt-ZXQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjZyJvYv-LJAhWDbxQKHZNsAbk4HhDoAQg0MAQ#v=onepage&q=essays%20by%20john%20clare&f=false Extract.]</ref>

==Revived interest==
Clare was relatively forgotten in the later 19th century, but interest in his work was revived by [[Arthur Symons]] in 1908, [[Edmund Blunden]] in 1920 and John and [[Anne Tibble]] in their ground-breaking 1935 two-volume edition, while in 1949 [[Geoffrey Grigson]] edited as ''Poems of John Clare's Madness'' (published by [[Routledge and Kegan Paul]]). [[Benjamin Britten]] set some of "May" from ''A Shepherd's Calendar'' in his ''[[Spring Symphony]]'' of 1948 and included a setting of ''The Evening Primrose'' in his [[List of compositions by Benjamin Britten|''Five Flower Songs'']].

Copyright on much of his work was claimed after 1965 by the editor of the ''Complete Poetry'', Professor Eric Robinson,<ref>[[Oxford University Press]], 9 vols, 1984–2003).</ref> but this has been contested. Recent publishers such as Faber and Carcanet have refused to acknowledge it and it seems the copyright is defunct.<ref>{{Cite web |author=John Goodridge |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/jul/22/poetry.books |title=Poor Clare |work=The Guardian |date=22 July 2000 |access-date=12 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,12084,885727,00.html |title=Letter from Eric Robinson: Clare's rights |publisher=Books, The Guardian |date=31 January 2003 |access-date=15 August 2012 |location=London}}</ref>

The largest collection of original Clare manuscripts is held at [[Peterborough Museum and Art Gallery]], where items are available to view by appointment.

Altering what Clare actually wrote continued into the later 20th century. [[Helen Gardner (critic)|Helen Gardner]], for instance, amended both the punctuation and the spelling and grammar when editing the ''[[New Oxford Book of English Verse 1250–1950]]'' (1972).

Since 1993, the John Clare Society of North America has organised an annual session of scholarly papers concerning John Clare at the annual Convention of the [[Modern Language Association|Modern Language Association of America]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.johnclare.org/ClareSessionMLA.htm |title=MLA Session organized by the John Clare Society of North America |website=Johnclare.org |access-date=15 August 2012}}</ref> In 2003 the scholar [[Jonathan Bate]] published the first major critical biography of Clare, which helped to keep up the revival in popular and academic interest.<ref>{{Cite news |author=Andrew Motion |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/oct/18/featuresreviews.guardianreview5 |title=Review: John Clare: A Biography by Jonathan Bate |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=18 October 2003 |access-date=26 January 2016}}</ref>

==John Clare Cottage==
{{Main|John Clare Cottage}}
The thatched cottage where Clare was born was bought by the John Clare Trust in 2005.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.clarecottage.org/ |title=Home |website=Clarecottage.org |access-date=24 April 2018}}</ref> In May 2007 the Trust gained £1.27 million of funding from the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] and commissioned [[Jefferson Sheard Architects]] to create a new landscape design and visitor centre, including a cafe, shop and exhibition area. The cottage at 12 Woodgate, Helpston, has been restored using traditional building methods and is open to the public. In 2013 the John Clare Trust received a further grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund to help preserve the building and provide educational activities for youngsters visiting it.<ref>Stephen Briggs, [http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/what-s-on/leisure-lifestyle/peterborough-heritage-sites-gets-big-lottery-boost-1-5185021 "Peterborough heritage sites gets big lottery boost"], ''Peterborough Telegraph'', 13 June 2013.</ref>
