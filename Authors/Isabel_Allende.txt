Allende's novels are often based upon her personal experience and historical events and pay homage to the lives of women, while weaving together elements of myth and realism. She has lectured and toured many U.S. colleges to teach literature. Fluent in English, Allende was granted United States citizenship in 1993, having lived in California since 1989, first with her U.S. husband (from whom she is now divorced).

== Biography ==
Allende was born '''Isabel Angélica Allende Llona''' in [[Lima]], [[Peru]], the daughter of Francisca Llona Barros called "Doña Panchita" (the daughter of Agustín Llona Cuevas and Isabel Barros Moreira) and Tomás Allende, who was at the time a second secretary at the Chilean embassy. Her father was a first cousin of [[Salvador Allende]], President of Chile from 1970 to 1973.<ref name="Review">"Review:  The undefeated: A life in writing: Often compared to Gabriel García Márquez, Isabel Allende is more interested in telling stories about her own life, her difficult upbringing, marriage, and her daughter's death.'"Aida Edemariam.

The article notes that Allende has been told that her father left them and that due to Chile's anti-divorce laws, Allende's mother couldn't divorce Tomás. Her mother, 83 when the article was published, and her stepfather, 87 at the time, have lived together for 57 years, but they are still not recognized in Chile as married.</ref><ref name="isabelallende.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.isabelallende.com/roots_timeline_001.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=13 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213022500/http://isabelallende.com/roots_timeline_001.htm|title=Isabel Allende |website=Isabelallende.com|access-date=11 November 2017|quote=''1962'' Isabel marries Miguel Frías.}}</ref> Between 1953 and 1958, Allende's mother was married to Ramón Huidobro and moved often. Huidobro was a diplomat appointed to Bolivia and Beirut. In Bolivia, Allende attended an American private school; and in [[Beirut, Lebanon]], she attended an English private school. The family returned to Chile in 1958, where Allende was also briefly home-schooled. In her youth, she read widely, particularly the works of [[William Shakespeare]].<ref>{{Cite book|oclc=793578915|title=Living with Shakespeare : essays by writers, actors, and directors|last=Carson|first= Susannah|year=2013|isbn=978-0-307-74291-9|location=New York}}</ref>

In 1970, Salvador Allende appointed Huidobro as ambassador to Argentina.<ref name="isabelallende.com"/>

While living in Chile, Allende finished her secondary studies and met engineering student Miguel Frías whom she married in 1962.<ref name="isabelallende.com"/> Reportedly, "Allende married early, into an Anglophile family and a kind of double life: at home she was the obedient wife and mother of two; in public she became, after a spell translating [[Barbara Cartland]], a moderately well-known TV personality, a dramatist and a journalist on a feminist magazine."<ref name="Review"/>

From 1959 to 1965, Allende worked with the United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] in Santiago, then in [[Brussels]], and elsewhere in Europe. For a short time in Chile, she also had a job translating romance novels from English to Spanish.<ref name="Companion">Cox, Karen Castellucci (2003), [http://www.questiaschool.com/read/111670240?title=Isabel%20Allende%3A%20%20A%20Critical%20Companion ''Isabel Allende: A Critical Companion''], Greenwood Press, 184 pp. 2–4.</ref> However, she was fired for making unauthorized changes to the dialogue of the heroines to make them sound more intelligent, as well as altering the [[Cinderella]] ending to allow the heroines to find more independence and do good in the world.<ref name="alter2010">{{Cite news|last=Alter|first=Alexandra|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704448304575196020575568424|title=Isabel Allende on Superstition and Memory|date=25 May 2010|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|access-date=23 April 2010|page=W4|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660|quote=... she often changed the dialogue and endings to make the heroines seem smarter.}}</ref>

Allende and Frías's daughter [[Paula Frías Allende|Paula]] was born in 1963. In 1966, Allende again returned to Chile, where her son Nicolás was born that year.

Allende has stated that her move from Chile made her a serious writer: "I don’t think I would be a writer if I had stayed in Chile. I would be trapped in the chores, in the family, in the person that people expected me to be." Allende believed that, being female in a patriarchal family, she was not expected to be a "liberated" person.<ref name=Norton /> Her history of oppression and liberation is thematically found in much of her fiction, where women contest the ideals of patriarchal leaders.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dulfano|first=Isabel|date=October 2013|title=A Response to Isabel Allende's Tanner Humanities Center Human Values Speech|journal=Women's Studies|volume=42|issue=7|pages=816–826|doi=10.1080/00497878.2013.820615|s2cid=145191631|issn=0049-7878}}</ref> In Venezuela she was a columnist for ''[[El Nacional (Caracas)|El Nacional]]'', a major national newspaper.<ref name="correaguatarasma2014">{{cite web|last=Correa Guatarasma|first=Andrés|url=http://www.eluniversal.com/internacional/140415/isabel-allende-mis-mejores-amigos-son-venezolanos|language=es|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425123141/https://www.eluniversal.com/internacional/140415/isabel-allende-mis-mejores-amigos-son-venezolanos|date=15 April 2014|archive-date=25 April 2014|title=Isabel Allende: "mis mejores amigos son venezolanos"|trans-title=Isabel Allende: "my best friends are Venezuelans"|location=[[Caracas]]|publisher=[[El Universal (Caracas)|Eluniversal.com]]|access-date=11 November 2017}}{{Verse translation|lang=es|'''¿Cómo resume su vida de exilio en Caracas?'''<br />Los chilenos nos beneficiamos de Venezuela como miles de miles de otros de Argentina, Uruguay.

During her time in Venezuela, Allende was a freelance journalist for ''El Nacional'' in [[Caracas]] from 1976 to 1983 and an administrator of the Marrocco School in Caracas from 1979 to 1983.<ref name="Glance"/>

In 1981, while in Caracas, Allende received a phone call informing her that her 99-year-old grandfather was near death, and she sat down to write him a letter, hoping to thereby "keep him alive, at least in spirit." The letter evolved into a book, ''[[The House of the Spirits]]'' (1982); this work intended to exorcise the ghosts of the Pinochet dictatorship. The book was rejected by numerous Latin American publishers, but eventually published in Buenos Aires. The book soon ran to more than two dozen editions in Spanish and was translated into a score of languages. Allende was compared to [[Gabriel García Márquez]] as an author in the style known as [[magical realism]].<ref name="Review"/><ref name="levine2002">{{Cite book|last=Levine|first=Linda Gould|title=Isabel Allende|date=2002|publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|Twayne Publishers]]|isbn=978-0-8057-1689-4|location=New York|language=en|oclc=48754834|pages=114–133}}</ref>

Although Allende is often cited as a practitioner of magical realism, her works also display elements of [[Latin American Boom#Post-Boom|post-Boom literature]]. Allende also holds to a very strict writing routine.<ref>''LATIN AMERICA'S SCHEHERAZADE; Drawing on dreams, myths, and memories, Chilean novelist Isabel Allende weaves fantastical tales in which reality and the absurd intersect.''

Allende's book ''Paula'' (1995) is a memoir of her childhood in Santiago and the years she spent in exile. It is written as an anguished letter to her daughter. In 1991, an error in Paula's medication resulted in severe brain damage, leaving her in a persistent vegetative state.<ref name="hornblower1995">{{cite magazine |last=Hornblower|first=Margot|author-link=Margot Roosevelt|date=10 July 1995 |title=Grief and Rebirth |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,983156,00.html |url-access=subscription |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140722021357/http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,983156,00.html|archive-date=22 July 2014|url-status=live|magazine=Time |volume=146 |issue=2 |page=65 |access-date=2 November 2017 }}</ref> Allende spent months at Paula's bedside before learning that a hospital mishap had caused the brain damage.

''Latino Leaders Magazine'' called her a "literary legend" in a 2007 article naming her the third most influential Latino leader in the world.<ref name="Top"/>

Her work has drawn some negative criticism. In an article published in ''Entre paréntesis'', [[Roberto Bolaño]] called Allende's literature anemic, comparing it to "a person on his deathbed," and later called her "a writing machine, not a writer".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bolaño|first=Roberto|author-link=Roberto Bolaño|title=Entre paréntesis : ensayos, artículos y discursos (1998-2003)|date=2004|publisher=Editorial Anagrama|others=Echevarría, Ignacio.|isbn=84-339-6210-8|location=Barcelona|oclc=57244781|page=102}}</ref><ref>[[Roberto Bolaño|Bolaño, Roberto]].

{{quote|text=The fact people think that when you sell a lot of books you are not a serious writer is a great insult to the readership. I get a little angry when people try to say such a thing.
