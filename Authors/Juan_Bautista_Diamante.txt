'''Juan Bautista Diamante''' (29 August 1625? &ndash; 2 November 1687), minor [[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[playwright|dramatist]] of the school of [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca|Calderón]], was the son of a Portuguese mother and a Sicilian merchant of Greek parentage who came to Madrid some time before 1631. He began writing for the stage in the early 1650s, gained favour at the courts of [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] and [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]], and became a [[Order of St. John of Malta|knight of St. John (of Malta)]] in 1660. It has been suggested{{Hair space}}<ref>R V Pringle: [http://www.nesms.org.uk/rvp/diamante/NewLight.html "New Light on Juan Bautista Diamante"]</ref> that Juan Bautista may have been of Jewish stock, and that the Diamante family, including the playwright's half-brothers Pablo and Francisco Diamante who also achieved success in their different spheres, falsified public records of marriage, baptism, etc. in order to obscure their ''[[marrano]]'' origins.<ref>R V Pringle: [http://www.nesms.org.uk/rvp/diamante/sumario.html "Documentos relativos a la familia de Juan Bautista Diamante (1625?-1687)"]</ref>

Thirty-nine plays were published in his lifetime,<ref>R V Pringle: [http://www.nesms.org.uk/rvp/diamante/obras.html "A checklist of plays by or attributed to Juan Bautista Diamante"]</ref> twenty-four of them as ''Comedias de Fr. Don Iuan Bautista Diamante'' . . . in two parts in 1670 and 1674; the remainder appeared between 1656 and 1672 in the series ''Comedias escogidas de los mejores de España'' . . .  .  Many plays (some of doubtful attribution, such as ''La devoción del rosario'', ''La Magdalena de Roma''{{Hair space}}<ref>R V Pringle: [http://www.nesms.org.uk/rvp/magdalena/MagdalenaIntro1.html ''La Magdalena de Roma'' (edited version based on the 1713 Zaragoza MS) - authorship and date]</ref> and ''La Judía de Toledo'' &ndash; see below) were printed or reprinted as ''[[suelta (print)|suelta]]s'' in the eighteenth century.

Diamante collaborated with other playwrights and poets of the time, notably [[Juan de Matos Fragoso|Matos Fragoso]], [[Agustín Moreto|Moreto]], [[Juan Vélez de Guevara|Juan Vélez]], [[Sebastián Rodríguez de Villaviciosa|Sebastián de Villaviciosa]], [[Pedro Francisco Lanini|Lanini y Sagredo]], [[Ambrosio de Arce|Arce de los Reyes]] and [[Francisco de Avellaneda]]. In all, including works of collaboration, he produced around forty-five plays, plus two ''[[Auto sacramental|autos]]'', a number of ''[[zarzuela]]s'', and a handful of minor pieces (''[[Loa (Spanish play)|loas]]'', ''[[Baile (Spanish play)|bailes]]'' and ''[[entremés|entremeses]]'').

According to Valbuena Prat,<ref>Ángel Valbuena Prat, ''Historia del teatro español'' (Barcelona, 1956), pp. 413, 452.</ref> Diamante is historically interesting as the introducer of French dramatic methods into Spain. The originality of his work has however been questioned by critics.<ref>George Ticknor, ''History of Spanish Literature'' (3rd ed. Boston, 1864), II, 330, n. 12.</ref> Much of his output is essentially a reworking or ''refundición'' of other dramatists' material. ''La Judía de Toledo'', which was long considered his best play, is really [[Antonio Mira de Amescua|Mira de Amescua]]'s ''La Desgraciada Raquel'' under another title; and ''El Honrador de su padre'' (1658), is little more than a free translation (up to the end of the second act, at least) of [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]]'s ''[[Le Cid]]''.

His more successful plays<ref>E. Cotarelo y Mori, ''Don Juan Bautista Diamante y sus comedias'', in ''Boletín de la Real Academia Española'', vol. 3 (1916), pp. 272-97 and 454-97.</ref> were historical dramas such as ''El hércules de Ocaña'', on the fearless [[Alonso de Céspedes]], ''el Alcides castellano'', and ''La reina María Estuarda'', on the life (and death) of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]].
