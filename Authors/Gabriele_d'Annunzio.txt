He occupied a prominent place in [[Italian literature]] from 1889 to 1910 and later political life from 1914 to 1924. He was often referred to under the epithets ''Il Vate'' ("the Poet")<ref>The Italian ''vate'' directly stems from [[Latin]] ''vates''.

D'Annunzio was associated with the [[Decadent movement]] in his literary works, which interplayed closely with French [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and British [[Aestheticism]]. Such works represented a turn against the [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]] of the preceding romantics and was both sensuous and mystical. He came under the influence of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] which would find outlets in his literary and later political contributions. His affairs with several women, including [[Eleonora Duse]] and [[Luisa Casati]], received public attention.

During the First World War, perception of D'Annunzio in Italy transformed from literary figure into a national [[war hero]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ilpiccolo.gelocal.it/polopoly_fs/1.13266527.1460193009!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/detail_558/image.jpg |title=D'Annunzio and "Carnaro" irredentism |access-date=31 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422195607/http://ilpiccolo.gelocal.it/polopoly_fs/1.13266527.1460193009!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/detail_558/image.jpg |archive-date=22 April 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He was associated with the elite ''[[Arditi]]'' storm troops of the [[Italian Army]] and took part in actions such as the [[Flight over Vienna]].

==Biography==
===Early life===

[[File:Pescara 2007 -Casa natale di Gabriele D'Annunzio- by-RaBoe 02.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Birthplace of Gabriele D'Annunzio Museum]] in Pescara]]
[[File:Gabriele D'Annunzio a 7 anni.jpg|thumb|Gabriele D'Annunzio, aged 7 (1870)]]

D'Annunzio was born in the township of [[Pescara]], in the [[Italian regions|region]] of [[Abruzzo]], the son of a wealthy [[landowner]] and mayor of the town, Francesco Paolo Rapagnetta D'Annunzio (1831–1893) and his wife Luisa de Benedictis (1839-1917). His father had originally been born plain Rapagnetta (the name of his single mother), but at the age of 13 had been adopted by a childless rich uncle, Antonio D'Annunzio.<ref>Joseph Guerin Fucilla, Joseph Médard Carrière ''D'Annunzio abroad: a bibliographical essay'' Volume 2, page 29 1935 "(Translation of the birth certificate of D'Annunzio's father, Francesco Paolo Rapagnetta, of the legal act recognizing the latter's adoption by his uncle Antonio D'Annunzio, and the birth certificate of Gabriele d'Annunzio)."</ref><ref>André Geiger Gabriele d'Annunzio, 1918, page 142: "Après la légitimation, et conformément à la loi, il perdit ce nom de Rapagnetta pour prendre le seul nom du père qui l'avait légitimé. Il est probable que le Camillo Rapagnetta, qui figure dans l'acte de naissance du poète, était un parent, ..."</ref> Legend has it that he was initially [[baptism|baptized]] Gaetano and given the name of Gabriele later in childhood, because of his angelic looks,<ref>Adrian Room, ''Dictionary of Pseudonyms: 13,000 Assumed Names and Their Origins'' (2010), [https://books.google.com/books?id=eSIhzKnNUf4C&pg=PA132#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 132]</ref> a story that has largely been disproven.<ref>For the urban legend: Cfr. A. Rapagnetta, ''La vera origine familiare e il vero cognome del poeta abruzzese Gabriele D'Annunzio'', Carabba, Lanciano, 1938; online sources on the real birthname of "Gabriele D'Annunzio": [http://www.italialibri.net/autori/dannunzio.html] and [http://www.istrianet.org/istria/history/1800-present/dannunzio/index.htm]</ref>

His precocious talent was recognised early in life, and he was sent to school at the Liceo Cicognini in [[Prato]], Tuscany.

He published his first poetry while still at school at the age of sixteen — a small volume of verses called ''Primo Vere'' (1879). Influenced by [[Giosuè Carducci]]'s ''Odi barbare'', he posed side by side some almost brutal imitations of [[Olindo Guerrini|Lorenzo Stecchetti]], the fashionable poet of ''Postuma'', with translations from the Latin. His verse was distinguished by such agile grace that literary critic Giuseppe Chiarini on reading them brought the unknown youth before the public in an enthusiastic article.

In 1881 D'Annunzio entered the [[University of Rome La Sapienza]], where he became a member of various literary groups, including ''Cronaca Bizantina'', and wrote articles and criticism for local newspapers. In those university years he started to promote [[Italian irredentism]].

===Literary work===

[[File:Gabriele D'Annunzio.jpg|thumb|left|upright|D'Annunzio in 1889]]

He published ''Canto novo'' (1882), ''Terra vergine'' (1882), ''L'intermezzo di rime'' (1883), ''Il libro delle vergini'' (1884) and the greater part of the short stories that were afterwards collected under the general title of ''San Pantaleone'' (1886). ''Canto novo'' contains poems full of pulsating youth and the promise of power, some descriptive of the sea and some of the Abruzzese landscape, commented on and completed in prose by ''Terra vergine'', the latter a collection of short stories dealing in radiant language with the peasant life of the author's native province. ''Intermezzo di rime'' is the beginning of D'Annunzio's second and characteristic manner. His conception of style was new, and he chose to express all the most subtle vibrations of voluptuous life. Both style and contents began to startle his critics; some who had greeted him as an ''enfant prodige'' rejected him as a perverter of public morals, whilst others hailed him as one bringing a breath of fresh air and an impulse of new vitality into the somewhat prim, lifeless work hitherto produced.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Meanwhile, the review of D'Annunzio publisher Angelo Sommaruga perished in the midst of scandal, and his group of young authors found itself dispersed. Some entered the teaching career and were lost to literature, others threw themselves into journalism.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Gabriele D'Annunzio took this latter course, and joined the staff of the ''Tribuna'', under the pseudonym of "Duca Minimo". Here he wrote ''Il libro d'Isotta'' (1886), a love poem, in which for the first time he drew inspiration adapted to modern sentiments and passions from the rich colours of the Renaissance.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

''Il libro d'Isotta'' is interesting also, because in it one can find most of the germs of his future work, just as in ''Intermezzo melico'' and in certain ballads and sonnets one can find descriptions and emotions which later went to form the aesthetic contents of ''Il piacere'', ''Il trionfo della morte'' and ''Elegie romane'' (1892).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

D'Annunzio's first novel ''[[Il Piacere]]'' (1889, translated into English as ''The Child of Pleasure'') was followed in 1891 by ''[[Giovanni Episcopo]]'', and in 1892 by ''[[The Intruder (D'Annunzio novel)|L'innocente]]'' (''The Intruder''). These three novels made a profound impression. ''L'innocente'', admirably translated into French by Georges Herelle, brought its author the notice and applause of foreign critics. His next work, ''[[Il trionfo della morte]]'' (''The Triumph of Death'') (1894), was followed soon by ''Le vergini delle rocce'' (''The Maidens of the Rocks'') (1896) and ''[[The Flame (novel)|Il fuoco]]'' (''The Flame of Life'') (1900); the latter is in its descriptions of Venice perhaps the most ardent glorification of a city existing in any language.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

D'Annunzio's poetic work of this period, in most respects his finest, is represented by ''Il Poema Paradisiaco'' (1893), the ''Odi navali'' (1893), a superb attempt at civic poetry, and ''Laudi'' (1900).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

A later phase of D'Annunzio's work is his dramatic production, represented by ''Il sogno di un mattino di primavera'' (1897), a lyrical fantasia in one act, and his ''Città Morta'' (''The Dead City'') (1898), written for [[Sarah Bernhardt]]. In 1898 he wrote his ''Sogno di un pomeriggio d'autunno'' and ''[[La Gioconda (play)|La Gioconda]]''; in the succeeding year ''La gloria'', an attempt at contemporary political tragedy which met with no success, probably because of the audacity of the personal and political allusions in some of its scenes; and then ''[[Francesca da Rimini (play)|Francesca da Rimini]]'' (1901), based on an episode from [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]''; a perfect reconstruction of medieval atmosphere and emotion, magnificent in style, and declared by an authoritative Italian critic – Edoardo Boutet – to be the first real, if imperfect, tragedy ever given to the Italian theatre.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} It was adapted by Tito Ricordi to become the libretto for the opera [[Francesca da Rimini (Zandonai)|Francesca da Rimini]] by [[Riccardo Zandonai]], which premiered in 1914.

In 1883, D'Annunzio married Maria Hardouin di Gallese, and had three sons, Mario (1884-1964), Gabriele Maria "Gabriellino" (1886-1945) and Ugo Veniero (1887-1945), but the marriage ended in 1891. In 1894, he began a love affair with the actress [[Eleonora Duse]] which became a cause célèbre.<ref>{{cite book |last1=D'Annunzio |first1=Gabrielle |title=The Book of the Virgins |date=2003 |publisher=Hesperus Press Limited |location=London |isbn=1843910527 |page=101 |language=en}}</ref> He provided leading roles for her in his plays of the time such as ''La città morta'' (1898) and ''Francesca da Rimini'' (1901), but the tempestuous relationship finally ended in 1910. After meeting [[Luisa Casati|the Marchesa Luisa Casati]] in 1903, he began a lifelong turbulent on again-off again affair with Luisa, that lasted until a few years before his death.

In 1897, D'Annunzio was elected to the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]] for a three-year term, where he sat as an independent. By 1910, his daredevil lifestyle had forced him into debt, and he fled to France to escape his creditors. There he collaborated with composer [[Claude Debussy]] on a musical play, ''[[Le Martyre de saint Sébastien]]'' (''The Martyrdom of St [[Saint Sebastian|Sebastian]]''), 1911, written for [[Ida Rubinstein]]. The [[Holy See|Vatican]] reacted by placing all of his works in the [[Index of Forbidden Books]]. The work was not successful as a play, but it has been recorded in adapted versions several times, notably by [[Pierre Monteux]] (in French), [[Leonard Bernstein]] (sung in French, acted in English), and [[Michael Tilson Thomas]] (in French). In 1912 and 1913, D'Annunzio worked with opera composer [[Pietro Mascagni]], writing the libretto for the opera ''[[Parisina (Mascagni)|Parisina]]'', staying sometimes in a house rented by the composer in Bellevue, near Paris. D'Annunzio insisted that the entire, long libretto should be set to music, which eventually meant that the work was too long for audiences of the time, and required the entire last act to be removed.

In [[1901]], D'Annunzio and [[Ettore Ferrari]], the [[Grand Master (Masonic)|Grand Master]] of the [[Grand Orient of Italy]], founded the Università Popolare di Milano (Popular University of [[Milan]]), located in via [[Ugo Foscolo]]. D'Annunzio held the inaugural speech and subsequently became an associated professor and a lecturer in the same institution.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.unipmi.org/1/la_nostra_storia_1957302.html |title = Our History - Gabriele D'Annunzio | publisher = Università Popolare di Milano | language = it | access-date = Sep 21, 2018 | website = unipmi.org | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110131104107/http://www.unipmi.org/1/la_nostra_storia_1957302.html | archive-date = Jan 31, 2011}}</ref>

D'Annunzio was a [[Grand Master (Masonic)|Grand Master]] of the [[Scottish Rite]] [[Gran Loggia d'Italia|Great Lodge of Italy]] which in 1908 had separated from the [[Grand Orient of Italy]].<ref>{{cite book | author1 = Fulvio Conti | title = Storia della massoneria italiana.

===World War I===

[[File:Volantinodann.jpg|thumb|280px|Italian translation of the propaganda leaflet which D'Annunzio threw from his airplane during his flight above Vienna.]]
{{Main|Flight over Vienna}}

After the start of [[World War I]], D'Annunzio returned to Italy and made public speeches in favor of Italy's entry on the side of the [[Triple Entente]]. Since taking a flight with [[Wilbur Wright]] in 1908, D'Annunzio had been interested in aviation. With the war beginning he volunteered and achieved further celebrity as a [[Fighter aircraft|fighter pilot]], losing the sight of an eye in a flying accident.

[[File:Gabriele DAnnunzio.jpg|thumb|Gabriele D'Annunzio (left) with a fellow officer]]
In February 1918, he took part in a daring, if militarily irrelevant, [[Bakar mockery|raid on the harbour]] of [[Bakar]] (known in Italy as ''La beffa di Buccari'', lit. ''the Bakar Mockery''), helping to raise the spirits of the Italian public, still battered by the [[Battle of Caporetto|Caporetto disaster]]. On 9 August 1918, as commander of the 87th fighter squadron "La Serenissima", he organized one of the great feats of the war, leading nine planes in a 700-mile round trip to drop propaganda leaflets on [[Vienna]]. This is called in Italian "il Volo su Vienna", "the [[Flight over Vienna]]".<ref>{{cite EB1922|wstitle=D'Annunzio, Gabriele}}</ref>

===Fiume===

The war strengthened his [[ultra-nationalist]] and [[Italia irredenta|irredentist]] views, and he campaigned widely for Italy to assume a role alongside her wartime [[Allies of World War I|allies]] as a first-rate European power. Angered by the proposed handing over of the city of [[Fiume]] (now [[Rijeka]] in Croatia) whose population, outside the suburbs, was mostly Italian, at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], on 12 September 1919, he led the seizure by 2,000 Italian nationalist irregulars of the city, forcing the withdrawal of the inter-Allied (American, British and French) occupying forces.<ref>H.R. Kedward, ''Fascism in Western Europe 1900–45'', p 40 New York University Press New York, 1971</ref> The plotters sought to have Italy annex Fiume, but were denied. Instead, Italy initiated a blockade of Fiume while demanding that the plotters surrender.

[[File:Fiume cheering D'Annunzio.jpg|thumb|[[Fiume]] residents cheering D'Annunzio and his raiders, September 1919]]
D'Annunzio then declared Fiume an independent state, the [[Italian Regency of Carnaro]]; the [[Charter of Carnaro]] foreshadowed much of the later Italian Fascist system, with himself as "Duce" (leader). Some elements of the [[Royal Italian Navy]], such as the destroyer ''Espero'' joined up with D'Annunzio's local forces.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D07E7D7163CE533A25752C1A9649D946195D6CF | work=The New York Times | title=D'ANNUNZIO PAYS DESERTING SAILORS; Hands Out 10,000 Francs to Crew of Destroyer—Its Officer Bound to Gun.WRANGEL TROOPS NEAR BYMany in Rome Look Hopefully to Giolitti to Find a Way Outof Flume Crisis | date=11 December 1920 | access-date=3 May 2010}}</ref> He attempted to organize an alternative to the [[League of Nations]] for (selected) oppressed nations of the world (such as the Irish, whom D'Annunzio attempted to arm in 1920),<ref>Mark Phelan, 'Prophet of the Oppressed Nations: Gabriele D'Annunzio and the Irish Republic, 1919–1921, ''History Ireland'' vol. 21, no, 5(Sept/Oct 2013, pp. 44–50.</ref> and sought to make alliances with various [[separatism|separatist]] groups throughout the [[Balkans]] (especially groups of Italians, though also some [[Slavs|Slavic]] and [[Committee for the National Defence of Kosovo|Albanian]]<ref>{{cite book|language=de|title=Lebenserinnerungen: 1912 bis 1925|trans-title=Memoirs: 1912–1925| page=154| author=Ekrem Vlora| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bnsITEI0l4IC&q=beqir+vokshi| isbn=9783486475715| publisher=Walter de Gruyter | year=1973}}</ref> groups), although without much success. D'Annunzio ignored the [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1920|Treaty of Rapallo]] and declared war on Italy itself, only finally surrendering the city on 29 December 1920 after a bombardment by the Italian navy and five days of fighting.

===Later life===

[[File:Vittoriale teatro.jpg|thumb|right|Villa of [[Vittoriale degli italiani]]]]

After the Fiume episode, D'Annunzio retired to his home on [[Lake Garda]] and spent his latter years writing and campaigning. Although D'Annunzio had a strong influence on the ideology of [[Benito Mussolini]], he never became directly involved in fascist government politics in Italy. In 1922, shortly before the [[march on Rome]], he was [[defenestration|pushed out of a window]] by an unknown assailant, or perhaps simply slipped and fell out himself while intoxicated. He survived but was badly injured, and only recovered after Mussolini had been appointed Prime Minister.

In 1924 he was ennobled by [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|King Victor Emmanuel III]] and given the hereditary title of Prince of [[Monte Nevoso|Montenevoso]] ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Principe di Montenevoso''). In 1937 he was made president of the [[Royal Academy of Italy]]. D'Annunzio died in 1938 of a stroke, at his home in [[Gardone Riviera]]. He was given a state funeral by Mussolini and was interred in a magnificent tomb constructed of white marble at [[Il Vittoriale degli Italiani]].

His son [[Gabriellino D'Annunzio]] became a film director. His 1921 film ''[[Carlo Zeno#In Literature|The Ship]]'' was based on a novel by his father. In 1924, he co-directed the historical epic ''[[Quo Vadis (1924 film)|Quo Vadis]]'', an expensive failure, before retiring from filmmaking.

==Politics==

[[File:Picture of Gabriele D'Annunzio.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Picture of D'Annunzio]]

D'Annunzio is often seen as [[proto-fascism|a precursor of the ideals and techniques of Italian fascism]]. His political ideals emerged in Fiume when he coauthored a constitution with [[syndicalism|syndicalist]] [[Alceste de Ambris]], the [[Charter of Carnaro]]. De Ambris provided the legal and political framework, to which D'Annunzio added his skills as a poet. De Ambris was the leader of a group of Italian seamen who had mutinied and then given their vessel to the service of D'Annunzio. The constitution established a [[corporatist]] state, with nine corporations to represent the different sectors of the economy (workers, employers, professionals), and a tenth (D'Annunzio's invention) to represent the "superior" human beings (heroes, poets, prophets, supermen). The ''Carta'' also declared that music was the fundamental principle of the state.

D'Annunzio, the de facto dictator of Fiume, maintained control through what has been described as a "new and dangerously potent politics of spectacle".<ref name="Lowe">{{cite book |last1=Lowe |first1=Brian |title=Moral Claims in the Age of Spectacles: Shaping the Social Imaginary |date=Aug 9, 2017 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9781137502414 |page=72}}</ref> It was this culture of dictatorship that [[Benito Mussolini]] imitated and learned from D'Annunzio.

===Rivalry with Mussolini===

As John Whittam notes in his essay "Mussolini and The Cult of the Leader":<ref>''Mussolini and the Cult of the Leader'', John Whittam, New Perspective, vol 3, no 3, March 1998 pp. 12–16</ref>

<blockquote>This famous poet, novelist and war hero was a self-proclaimed Superman. He was the outstanding interventionist in May 1915 and his dramatic exploits during the war won him national and international acclaim. In September 1919 he gathered together his 'legions' and captured the disputed seaport of Fiume. He held it for over a year and it was he who popularised the black shirts, the balcony speeches, the promulgation of ambitious charters and the entire choreography of street parades and ceremonies. He even planned a march on Rome. One historian had rightly described him as the 'First Duce' and Mussolini must have heaved a sigh of relief when he was driven from Fiume in December 1920 and his followers were dispersed. But he remained a threat to Mussolini and in 1921 Fascists like Balbo seriously considered turning to him for leadership.</blockquote>

In contrast Mussolini vacillated from left to right at this time. Although Mussolini's fascism was heavily influenced by the [[Charter of Carnaro|Carta del Carnaro]], the constitution for Fiume written by [[Alceste De Ambris]] and D'Annunzio, neither wanted to play an active part in the new movement, both refusing when asked by Fascist supporters to run in the elections of 15 May 1921. Before the [[March on Rome]], De Ambris even went so far as to depict the Fascist movement as: "''a filthy pawn in Mister [[Giovanni Giolitti|Giolitti]]'s game of chess, and made out of the least dignified section of the [[bourgeoisie]]''"

D'Annunzio was seriously injured when he fell out of a window on 13 August 1922; subsequently the planned "meeting for national pacification" with [[Francesco Saverio Nitti]] and Mussolini was cancelled. The incident was never explained and is considered by some historians an attempt to murder him, motivated by his popularity. Despite D'Annunzio's retreat from active public life after this event, the Duce still found it necessary to regularly dole out funds to D'Annunzio as a bribe for not re-entering the political arena. When asked about this by a close friend, Mussolini purportedly stated: "When you have a rotten tooth you have two possibilities open to you: either you pull the tooth or you fill it with gold. With D'Annunzio I have chosen for the latter treatment."<ref>''The Vittoriale degli Italiani'', Fred Licht, The Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, Vol. 41, No. 4 (Dec. 1982), pp. 318–324</ref>

Nonetheless, D'Annunzio kept attempting to intervene in politics almost until his death in 1938. He wrote to Mussolini in 1933 to try to convince him not to ally with Hitler. In 1934, he tried to disrupt the relationship between Hitler and Mussolini after their first meeting, even writing a satirical pamphlet about Hitler. In September 1937, D'Annunzio met with Mussolini at the [[Verona]] train station to convince him to leave the Axis alliance.

==Literature==

[[File:Nunes Vais, Mario (1856-1932) - Gabriele D'Annunzio sdraiato mentre legge.jpg|thumb|320px|Gabriele D'Annunzio reading (photo by Mario Nunes Vais)]]

At the height of his success, D'Annunzio was celebrated for the originality, power and decadence of his writing. Although his work had immense impact across Europe, and influenced generations of Italian writers, his ''fin de siècle'' works are now little known, and his literary reputation has always been clouded by his fascist associations. Indeed, even before his fascist period, he had his strong detractors. A ''New York Times'' review in 1898 of his novel ''The Intruder'' referred to him as "evil", "entirely selfish and corrupt".<ref>"D'Annunzio.; Books That Prove Him to Be Entirely Selfish and Corrupt", ''New York Times'', 5 March 1898. p. RBA145.</ref> Three weeks into its December 1901 run at the Teatro Constanzi in Rome, his tragedy ''[[Francesca da Rimini (play)|Francesca da Rimini]]'' was banned by the censor on grounds of morality.<ref>"D'Annunzio's Tragedy Prohibited by Censor.; Further Performances of ''Francesca da Rimini'' at Rome Forbidden on Moral Grounds", ''New York Times'', 31 December 1901. p. 5.</ref>

A prolific writer, his novels in Italian include ''Il piacere'' (''The Child of Pleasure'', 1889), ''Il trionfo della morte'' (''The Triumph of Death'', 1894), and ''Le vergini delle rocce'' (''The Maidens of the Rocks'', 1896). He wrote the screenplay to the feature film ''[[Cabiria]]'' (1914) based on episodes from the [[Second Punic War]]. D'Annunzio's literary creations were strongly influenced by the French [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] school, and contain episodes of striking violence and depictions of abnormal mental states interspersed with gorgeously imagined scenes. One of D'Annunzio's most significant novels, scandalous in its day, is ''Il fuoco'' (''The Flame of Life'') of 1900, in which he portrays himself as the [[Nietzsche]]an ''[[Übermensch|Superman]]'' Stelio Effrena, in a fictionalized account of his love affair with [[Eleonora Duse]]. His short stories showed the influence of [[Guy de Maupassant]]. He was also associated with the Italian noblewoman [[Luisa Casati]], an influence on his novels and one of his mistresses.

[[File:Gabriele d&#039;Annunzio-L&#039;armata d&#039;Italia-Carabba-1916.png|thumb|300 px|Gabriele d'Annunzio, ''L'armata d'Italia'', Carabba, 1916]]

The 1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' wrote of him:{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
<blockquote>The work of d' Annunzio, although by many of the younger generation injudiciously and extravagantly admired, is almost the most important literary work given to Italy since the days when the great classics welded her varying dialects into a fixed language. The psychological inspiration of his novels has come to him from many sources—French, Russian, Scandinavian, German—and in much of his earlier work there is little fundamental originality.</blockquote>

<blockquote>His creative power is intense and searching, but narrow and personal; his heroes and heroines are little more than one same type monotonously facing a different problem at a different phase of life. But the faultlessness of his style and the wealth of his language have been approached by none of his contemporaries, whom his genius has somewhat paralysed. In his later work [meaning as of 1911], when he begins drawing his inspiration from the traditions of bygone Italy in her glorious centuries, a current of real life seems to run through the veins of his personages. And the lasting merit of D'Annunzio, his real value to the literature of his country, consists precisely in that he opened up the closed mine of its former life as a source of inspiration for the present and of hope for the future, and created a language, neither pompous nor vulgar, drawn from every source and district suited to the requirements of modern thought, yet absolutely classical, borrowed from none, and, independently of the thought it may be used to express, a thing of intrinsic beauty. As his sight became clearer and his purpose strengthened, as exaggerations, affectations, and moods dropped away from his conceptions, his work became more and more typical Latin work, upheld by the ideal of an Italian Renaissance.</blockquote>

In Italy some of his poetic works remain popular, most notably his poem "La pioggia nel pineto" (''The Rain in the Pinewood''), which exemplifies his linguistic virtuosity as well as the sensuousness of his poetry. His work was part of the [[Art competitions at the 1912 Summer Olympics#Literature|literature event]] in the [[Art competitions at the 1912 Summer Olympics|art competition]] at the [[1912 Summer Olympics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.olympedia.org/athletes/920848 |title=Gabriele D'Annunzio |work=Olympedia |access-date=22 July 2020}}</ref>

==Museums==

D'Annunzio's life and work are commemorated in a museum, ''[[Il Vittoriale degli Italiani]]'' (''The Shrine of Italian Victories''). He planned and developed it himself, adjacent to his villa at [[Gardone Riviera]] on the southwest bank of [[Lake Garda]], between 1923 and his death. Now a national monument, it is a complex of military museum, library, literary and historical archive, theatre, war memorial and [[mausoleum]]. The museum preserves his [[torpedo boat]] ''MAS 96'' and the SVA-5 aircraft he flew over Vienna.

His birthplace is also open to the public as a museum, [[Birthplace of Gabriele D'Annunzio Museum]] in Pescara.
