Tagore modernised Bengali art by spurning rigid classical forms and resisting linguistic strictures. His novels, stories, songs, dance-dramas, and essays spoke to topics political and personal. ''[[Gitanjali]]'' (''Song Offerings''), ''[[Gora (novel)|Gora]]'' (''Fair-Faced'') and ''Ghare-Baire'' (''[[The Home and the World]]'') are his best-known works, and his verse, short stories, and novels were acclaimed—or panned—for their lyricism, colloquialism, naturalism, and unnatural contemplation. His compositions were chosen by two nations as national anthems: India's "[[Jana Gana Mana]]" and [[Bangladesh]]'s "[[Amar Shonar Bangla]]". The [[Sri Lanka Matha|Sri Lankan national anthem]] was inspired by his work.<ref name="RB1">

== Family history ==
{{See also|Tagore family}}

The original surname of the [[Tagore family|Tagores]] was Kushari. They were [[Bengali Brahmins|Rarhi Brahmins]] and originally belonged to a village named ''Kush'' in the district named [[Bardhaman district|Burdwan]] in [[West Bengal]]. The biographer of Rabindranath Tagore, [[Prabhat Kumar Mukhopadhyaya]] wrote in the first volume of his book ''Rabindrajibani O Rabindra Sahitya Prabeshak'' that
{{Cquote|quote=The Kusharis were the descendants of Deen Kushari, the son of [[Bhatta Narayana]]; Deen was granted a village named Kush (in [[Bardhaman district|Burdwan]] zilla) by [[Maharaja]] Kshitisura, he became its chief and came to be known as Kushari.<ref name="tagore1"/>''}}

Tagore was raised mostly by servants; his mother had died in his early childhood and his father travelled widely.{{Sfn|Thompson|1926|p=20}} The [[Tagore family]] was at the forefront of the [[Bengal renaissance]]. They hosted the publication of literary magazines; theatre and recitals of Bengali and Western classical music featured there regularly. Tagore's father invited several professional [[Dhrupad]] musicians to stay in the house and teach [[Indian classical music]] to the children.{{Sfn|Som|2010|p=16}} Tagore's oldest brother [[Dwijendranath Tagore|Dwijendranath]] was a philosopher and poet. Another brother, [[Satyendranath Tagore|Satyendranath]], was the first Indian appointed to the elite and formerly all-European [[Indian Civil Service]].

Tagore largely avoided classroom schooling and preferred to roam the manor or nearby [[Bolpur]] and [[Panihati]], which the family visited.{{Sfn|Thompson|1926|pp=21–24}}{{Sfn|Das|2009}} His brother [[Hemendranath Tagore|Hemendranath]] tutored and physically conditioned him—by having him swim the Ganges or trek through hills, by gymnastics, and by practising judo and wrestling. He learned drawing, anatomy, geography and history, literature, mathematics, Sanskrit, and English—his least favourite subject.{{Sfn|Dutta |Robinson|1995|pp=48–49}} Tagore loathed formal education—his scholarly travails at the local [[Presidency University, Kolkata|Presidency College]] spanned a single day. Years later he held that proper teaching does not explain things; proper teaching stokes curiosity:{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|pp=50}}

After his ''[[upanayan]]'' (coming-of-age rite) at age eleven, Tagore and his father left Calcutta in February 1873 to tour India for several months, visiting his father's [[Santiniketan]] estate and [[Amritsar]] before reaching the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] [[hill station]] of [[Dalhousie, India|Dalhousie]]. There Tagore read biographies, studied history, astronomy, modern science, and [[Sanskrit]], and examined the classical poetry of [[Kālidāsa]].<ref name="Dutta_1995_55-56">{{Harv |Dutta|Robinson |1995|pp=55–56}}.</ref><ref name="Stewart_2003_91">{{Harvnb|Tagore|Stewart|Twichell|2003|p=91}}.</ref> During his 1-month stay at Amritsar in 1873 he was greatly influenced by melodious [[gurbani]] and [[nanak bani]] being sung at Golden Temple for which both father and son were regular visitors. He mentions about this in his ''My Reminiscences'' (1912){{Quote|text= The golden temple of Amritsar comes back to me like a dream. Many a morning have I accompanied my father to this Gurudarbar of the Sikhs in the middle of the lake. There the sacred chanting resounds continually. My father, seated amidst the throng of worshippers, would sometimes add his voice to the hymn of praise, and finding a stranger joining in their devotions they would wax enthusiastically cordial, and we would return loaded with the sanctified offerings of sugar crystals and other sweets.<ref>{{cite web|title= A journey with my Father |work = My Reminiscences|url= http://www.online-literature.com/tagore-rabindranath/my-reminiscences/14/}}</ref> }} He wrote 6 poems relating to Sikhism and a number of articles in Bengali children's magazine about Sikhism.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Dev |first=Amiya |year=2014 |title=Tagore and Sikhism |url=http://www.mainstreamweekly.net/article5261.html |journal=Mainstream Weekly }}</ref>

Tagore returned to Jorosanko and completed a set of major works by 1877, one of them a long poem in the [[Maithili language|Maithili]] style of [[Vidyapati]]. As a joke, he claimed that these were the lost works of newly discovered 17th-century [[Vaishnavism|Vaiṣṇava]] poet Bhānusiṃha.<ref name="Stewart_2003_3">{{Harvnb|Tagore|Stewart|Twichell|2003|p=3}}.</ref> Regional experts accepted them as the lost works of the fictitious poet.{{Sfn|Tagore |Stewart|Twichell|2003|p=3}} He debuted in the short-story genre in Bengali with "[[Bhikharini]]" ("The Beggar Woman").{{Sfn|Tagore |Chakravarty|1961|p=45}}{{Sfn|Tagore|1997b|p=265}} Published in the same year, ''Sandhya Sangit'' (1882) includes the poem "Nirjharer Swapnabhanga" ("The Rousing of the Waterfall").

Because Debendranath wanted his son to become a barrister, Tagore enrolled at a public school in Brighton, East Sussex, England in 1878.{{Sfn|Ghosh|2011}} He stayed for several months at a house that the Tagore family owned near [[Brighton]] and [[Hove]], in Medina Villas; in 1877 his nephew and niece—Suren and [[Indira Devi Chaudhurani|Indira Devi]], the children of Tagore's brother [[Satyendranath Tagore|Satyendranath]]—were sent together with their mother, Tagore's sister-in-law, to live with him.{{Sfn|Dutta |Robinson|1995|p=68}} He briefly read law at [[University College London]], but again left school, opting instead for independent study of [[Shakespeare's plays]] ''[[Coriolanus]]'', and ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]] and the [[Religio Medici]] of [[Thomas Browne]].'' Lively English, Irish, and Scottish folk tunes impressed Tagore, whose own tradition of [[Nidhu Babu|Nidhubabu]]-authored ''[[kirtans]]'' and ''[[tappa]]s'' and [[Brahmo]] hymnody was subdued.{{Sfn|Ghosh|2011}}{{Sfn|Thompson|1926|p=31}} In 1880 he returned to Bengal degree-less, resolving to reconcile European novelty with Brahmo traditions, taking the best from each.{{Sfn|Tagore|1997b|pp=11–12}} After returning to Bengal, Tagore regularly published poems, stories, and novels. These had a profound impact within Bengal itself but received little national attention.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Makers of Modern India|last=Guha|first=Ramachandra | author-link = Ramachandra Guha|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University|year=2011|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|page=171}}</ref> In 1883 he married 10-year-old<ref name="Selected Letters of Rabindranath Tagore.">{{cite book |last1=Dutta |first1= Krishna |last2=Robinson |first2=Andrew |title=Selected Letters of Rabindranath Tagore |date=1997 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0-521-59018-1 |page=13 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v08xxlHuWtUC |access-date=27 April 2016}}</ref> [[Mrinalini Devi]], born Bhabatarini, 1873–1902 (this was a common practice at the time).

In 1890 Tagore began managing his vast ancestral estates in [[Shelaidaha]] (today a region of Bangladesh); he was joined there by his wife and children in 1898. Tagore released his ''Manasi'' poems (1890), among his best-known work.{{Sfn|Scott |2009|p=10}} As ''[[Zamindar]] Babu'', Tagore criss-crossed the [[Padma River]] in command of the ''Padma'', the luxurious family barge (also known as "[[budgerow]]"). He collected mostly token rents and blessed villagers who in turn honoured him with banquets—occasionally of dried rice and sour milk.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson |1995|pp=109–111}} He met [[Gagan Harkara]], through whom he became familiar with [[Baul]] [[Lalon Shah]], whose folk songs greatly influenced Tagore.<ref>{{Citation|last=Chowdury |first=A. A. |year=1992 |title=Lalon Shah |publisher=[[Bangla Academy]] |place=[[Dhaka]], Bangladesh |isbn=984-07-2597-1}}</ref> Tagore worked to popularise Lalon's songs. The period 1891–1895, Tagore's ''Sadhana'' period, named after one of his magazines, was his most productive;{{Sfn|Thompson|1926|p=20}} in these years he wrote more than half the stories of the three-volume, 84-story ''Galpaguchchha''.{{Sfn|Tagore|Chakravarty|1961|p=45}} Its ironic and grave tales examined the voluptuous poverty of an idealised rural Bengal.{{Sfn|Dutta |Robinson|1995|p=109}}

In 1901 Tagore moved to [[Santiniketan]] to found an [[ashram]] with a marble-floored prayer hall—''The [[:wikt:Mandir|Mandir]]''—an experimental school, groves of trees, gardens, a library.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=133}} There his wife and two of his children died. His father died in <!--19 January -->1905. He received monthly payments as part of his inheritance and income from the Maharaja of [[Tripura]], sales of his family's jewellery, his seaside bungalow in [[Puri]], and a derisory 2,000 rupees in book royalties.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson |1995|pp=139–140}} He gained Bengali and foreign readers alike; he published ''[[Naivedya]]'' (1901) and ''Kheya'' (1906) and translated poems into free verse.

In November 1913, Tagore learned he had won that year's [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]: the [[Swedish Academy]] appreciated the idealistic—and for Westerners—accessible nature of a small body of his translated material focused on the 1912 ''Gitanjali: Song Offerings''.{{Sfn|Hjärne|1913}} He was awarded a knighthood by King George V in the [[1915 Birthday Honours]], but Tagore renounced it after the 1919 [[Jallianwala Bagh massacre]].<ref>{{Cite book |title = Our Pasts: Volume 3, Part 2 |publisher = [[NCERT]] |year = 2014 |isbn = 978-81-7450-838-6|location = India |page = 148 |edition = Revised 2014 |type = History text book |chapter = The Rowlatt Satyagraha |editor1 = Anil Sethi|editor2 = Guha|editor3 = Khullar|editor4 = Nair|editor5 = Prasad|editor6 = Anwar|editor7 = Singh|editor8 = Mohapatra}}</ref> Renouncing the knighthood, Tagore wrote in a letter addressed to [[Frederic Thesiger, 1st Viscount Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]], the then British Viceroy of India, "The disproportionate severity of the punishments inflicted upon the unfortunate people and the methods of carrying them out, we are convinced, are without parallel in the history of civilised governments...The time has come when badges of honour make our shame glaring in their incongruous context of humiliation, and I for my part wish to stand, shorn of all special distinctions, by the side of my country men."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://dart.columbia.edu/library/tagore-letter/letter.html |title=Letter from Rabindranath Tagore to Lord Chelmsford, Viceroy of India |publisher=Digital Anthropology Resources for Teaching, Columbia University and the London School of Economics }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Tagore-renounced-his-Knighthood-in-protest-for-Jalianwalla-Bagh-mass-killing/articleshow/7967616.cms |title= Tagore renounced his Knighthood in protest for Jalianwalla Bagh mass killing |publisher=The Times of India, 13 April 2011 }}</ref>

In 1919, he was invited by the president and chairman of Anjuman-e-Islamia, [[Syed Abdul Majid]] to visit [[Sylhet]] for the first time.

In 1921, Tagore and agricultural economist [[Leonard Knight Elmhirst|Leonard Elmhirst]] set up the "Institute for Rural Reconstruction", later renamed Shriniketan or "Abode of Welfare", in [[Surul]], a village near the ''ashram''. With it, Tagore sought to moderate [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi's]] ''[[Swaraj]]'' protests, which he occasionally blamed for British India's perceived mental – and thus ultimately colonial – decline.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|pp=239–240}} He sought aid from donors, officials, and scholars worldwide to "free village[s] from the shackles of helplessness and ignorance" by "vitalis[ing] knowledge".{{Sfn|Dutta| Robinson|1995|p=242}}{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson |1995|pp=308–309}} In the early 1930s he targeted ambient "abnormal caste consciousness" and [[untouchability]]. He lectured against these, he penned [[Dalit]] heroes for his poems and his dramas, and he campaigned—successfully—to open [[Guruvayoor Temple]] to Dalits.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=303}}{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=309}}

Dutta and Robinson describe this phase of Tagore's life as being one of a "peripatetic [[litterateur]]". It affirmed his opinion that human divisions were shallow. During a May 1932 visit to a [[Bedouin]] encampment in the Iraqi desert, the tribal chief told him that "Our [[Muhammad|Prophet]] has said that a true Muslim is he by whose words and deeds not the least of his brother-men may ever come to any harm ..." Tagore confided in his diary: "I was startled into recognizing in his words the voice of essential humanity."{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=317}} To the end Tagore scrutinised orthodoxy—and in 1934, he struck. That year, [[1934 Nepal-Bihar earthquake|an earthquake]] hit Bihar and killed thousands. Gandhi hailed it as seismic ''[[karma]]'', as divine retribution avenging the oppression of Dalits. Tagore rebuked him for his seemingly ignominious implications.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|pp=312–313}} He mourned the perennial poverty of Calcutta and the socioeconomic decline of Bengal, and detailed these newly plebeian aesthetics in an unrhymed hundred-line poem whose technique of searing double-vision foreshadowed [[Satyajit Ray]]'s film ''[[Apur Sansar (The World of Apu)|Apur Sansar]]''.{{Sfn|Dutta| Robinson|1995|pp=335–338 }}{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson |1995|p=342}} Fifteen new volumes appeared, among them prose-poem works ''Punashcha'' (1932), ''Shes Saptak'' (1935), and ''Patraput'' (1936). Experimentation continued in his prose-songs and dance-dramas— ''[[Chitra (play)|Chitra]]<!--ngada-->'' (1914), ''Shyama'' (1939), and ''Chandalika'' (1938)— and in his novels— ''Dui Bon'' (1933), ''Malancha'' (1934), and ''Char Adhyay'' (1934).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thehindu.com/features/magazine/prose-over-verse/article5335356.ece |title=A 100 years ago, Rabindranath Tagore was awarded the Nobel Prize for poetry.

Tagore's remit expanded to science in his last years, as hinted in ''Visva-Parichay'', a 1937 collection of essays. His respect for scientific laws and his exploration of biology, physics, and astronomy informed his poetry, which exhibited extensive naturalism and verisimilitude.{{Sfn|Tagore| Radice|2004|p=28}} He wove the ''process'' of science, the narratives of scientists, into stories in ''Se'' (1937), ''Tin Sangi'' (1940), and ''Galpasalpa'' (1941). His last five years were marked by chronic pain and two long periods of illness. These began when Tagore lost consciousness in late 1937; he remained comatose and near death for a time. This was followed in late 1940 by a similar spell, from which he never recovered. Poetry from these valetudinary years is among his finest.{{Sfn|Dutta |Robinson|1995 |p=338}}{{Sfn |Indo-Asian News Service|2005}} A period of prolonged agony ended with Tagore's death on 7 August 1941, aged 80.<ref name="nobelfacts"/> He was in an upstairs room of the Jorasanko mansion in which he grew up.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=367}}{{Sfn|Dutta| Robinson|1995|p=363}} The date is still mourned.{{Sfn|The Daily Star|2009}} A.

On 1 November 1926 Tagore arrived to Hungary and spent some time on the shore of Lake Balaton in the city of Balatonfüred, recovering from heart problems at a sanitarium. He planted a tree and a bust statue was placed there in 1956 (a gift from the Indian government, the work of Rasithan Kashar, replaced by a newly gifted statue in 2005) and the lakeside promenade still bears his name since 1957.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

On 14 July 1927 Tagore and two companions began a four-month tour of Southeast Asia. They visited Bali, Java, Kuala Lumpur, Malacca, Penang, Siam, and Singapore.

Vice-President of India M. [[Hamid Ansari]] has said that Rabindranath Tagore heralded the cultural rapprochement between communities, societies and nations much before it became the liberal norm of conduct.
Tagore was a man ahead of his time.

==Works==
{{Main|Works of Rabindranath Tagore}}

Known mostly for his poetry, Tagore wrote novels, essays, short stories, travelogues, dramas, and thousands of songs. Of Tagore's prose, his short stories are perhaps most highly regarded; he is indeed credited with originating the Bengali-language version of the genre. His works are frequently noted for their rhythmic, optimistic, and lyrical nature. Such stories mostly borrow from the lives of common people. Tagore's non-fiction grappled with history, linguistics, and spirituality. He wrote autobiographies. His travelogues, essays, and lectures were compiled into several volumes, including ''Europe Jatrir Patro'' (''Letters from Europe'') and ''Manusher Dhormo'' (''[[The Religion of Man]]''). His brief chat with [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], "Note on the Nature of Reality", is included as an appendix to the latter. On the occasion of Tagore's 150th birthday, an anthology (titled ''Kalanukromik Rabindra Rachanabali'') of the total body of his works is currently being published in Bengali in chronological order. This includes all versions of each work and fills about eighty volumes.{{Sfn|Pandey|2011}} In 2011, [[Harvard University Press]] collaborated with [[Visva-Bharati University]] to publish ''[[The Essential Tagore]]'', the largest anthology of Tagore's works available in English; it was edited by [[Fakrul Alam]] and Radha Chakravarthy and marks the 150th anniversary of Tagore's birth.<ref>{{Citation |title=The Essential Tagore |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674057906 |access-date=19 December 2011}}</ref>

===Drama===
[[File:Valmiki Pratibha Indira Devi & Rabindranath Tagore.jpg|thumb|right|Tagore performing the title role in ''Valmiki Pratibha'' (1881) with his niece [[Indira Devi Chaudhurani|Indira Devi]] as the goddess [[Lakshmi]].]]

Tagore's experiences with drama began when he was sixteen, with his brother [[Jyotirindranath Tagore|Jyotirindranath]]. He wrote his first original dramatic piece when he was twenty — ''[[Valmiki Pratibha]]''  which was shown at the Tagore's mansion. Tagore stated that his works sought to articulate "the play of feeling and not of action".  In 1890 he wrote ''Visarjan'' (an adaptation of his novella ''Rajarshi''), which has been regarded as his finest drama.  In the original Bengali language, such works included intricate subplots and extended monologues. Later, Tagore's dramas used more philosophical and allegorical themes. The play ''[[The Post Office (play)|Dak Ghar]]'' (''The Post Office'''; 1912), describes the child Amal defying his stuffy and puerile confines by ultimately "fall[ing] asleep", hinting his physical death. A story with borderless appeal—gleaning rave reviews in Europe—''Dak Ghar'' dealt with death as, in Tagore's words, "spiritual freedom" from "the world of hoarded wealth and certified creeds".{{Sfn|Tagore|1997b|pp=21–22}}{{Sfn|Tagore|Chakravarty|1961|pp=123–124}} Another is Tagore's ''Chandalika'' (''Untouchable Girl''), which was modelled on an ancient Buddhist legend describing how [[Ananda]], the [[Gautama Buddha]]'s disciple, asks a [[Adivasi|tribal]] girl for water.{{Sfn|Tagore|Chakravarty|1961|p=124}} In ''Raktakarabi'' ("Red" or "Blood Oleanders") is an allegorical struggle against a kleptocrat king who rules over the residents of ''[[Yaksha]] [[Pur (Vedic)|puri]]''.{{Sfn|Ray|2007|pp=147–148}}

''Chitrangada'', ''Chandalika'', and ''Shyama'' are other key plays that have dance-drama adaptations, which together are known as ''[[Rabindra Nritya Natya]]''.

===Short stories===
[[File:Sabujpatra logo (1914-1927).jpg|thumb|upright|Cover of the ''[[Sabuj Patra]]'' magazine, edited by [[Pramatha Chaudhuri]]]]
Tagore began his career in short stories in 1877—when he was only sixteen—with "Bhikharini" ("The Beggar Woman").<ref name="Chakravarty_1961_45">{{Harvnb|Tagore|Chakravarty|1961|p=45}}.</ref> With this, Tagore effectively invented the Bengali-language short story genre.<ref name="Dutta_1997_265">{{Harv|Dutta|Robinson|1997|p=265}}.</ref> The four years from 1891 to 1895 are known as Tagore's "Sadhana" period (named for one of Tagore's magazines).  This period was among Tagore's most fecund, yielding more than half the stories contained in the three-volume ''Galpaguchchha'', which itself is a collection of eighty-four stories.<ref name="Chakravarty_1961_45"/> Such stories usually showcase Tagore's reflections upon his surroundings, on modern and fashionable ideas, and on interesting mind puzzles (which Tagore was fond of testing his intellect with).  Tagore typically associated his earliest stories (such as those of the "''Sadhana''" period) with an exuberance of vitality and spontaneity; these characteristics were intimately connected with Tagore's life in the common villages of, among others, [[Patisar]], Shajadpur, and [[Shilaidaha|Shilaida]] while managing the Tagore family's vast landholdings.<ref name="Chakravarty_1961_45"/> There, he beheld the lives of India's poor and common people; Tagore thereby took to examining their lives with a penetrative depth and feeling that was singular in Indian literature up to that point.<ref name="Chakravarty_1961_45-46">{{Harvnb|Tagore|Chakravarty|1961|pp=45–46}}</ref> In particular, such stories as "[[Kabuliwala (short story)|Kabuliwala]]" ("The Fruitseller from [[Kabul]]", published in 1892), "Kshudita Pashan" ("The Hungry Stones") (August 1895), and "Atithi" ("The Runaway", 1895) typified this analytic focus on the downtrodden.<ref name="Chakravarty_1961_46">{{Harvnb|Tagore|Chakravarty|1961|p=46}}</ref> Many of the other ''Galpaguchchha'' stories were written in Tagore's ''Sabuj Patra'' period from 1914 to 1917, also named after one of the magazines that Tagore edited and heavily contributed to.<ref name="Chakravarty_1961_45"/>

===Novels===
Tagore wrote eight novels and four novellas, among them ''Chaturanga'', ''[[Shesher Kobita]]'', ''Char Odhay'', and ''Noukadubi''. ''Ghare Baire'' (''[[The Home and the World]]'')—through the lens of the idealistic ''[[zamindar]]'' protagonist Nikhil—excoriates rising Indian nationalism, terrorism, and religious zeal in the [[Swadeshi movement|''Swadeshi'' movement]]; a frank expression of Tagore's conflicted sentiments, it emerged from a 1914 bout of depression. The novel ends in Hindu-Muslim violence and Nikhil's—likely mortal—wounding.{{sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=192–194}}

''Gora'' raises controversial questions regarding the Indian identity. As with ''Ghare Baire'', matters of self-identity (''[[jāti]]''), personal freedom, and religion are developed in the context of a family story and love triangle.{{sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=154–155}} In it an Irish boy orphaned in the [[Sepoy Mutiny]] is raised by Hindus as the titular ''gora''—"whitey". Ignorant of his foreign origins, he chastises Hindu religious backsliders out of love for the indigenous Indians and solidarity with them against his hegemon-compatriots. He falls for a Brahmo girl, compelling his worried foster father to reveal his lost past and cease his nativist zeal. As a "true dialectic" advancing "arguments for and against strict traditionalism", it tackles the colonial conundrum by "portray[ing] the value of all positions within a particular frame&nbsp;[...] not only syncretism, not only liberal orthodoxy, but the extremest reactionary traditionalism he defends by an appeal to what humans share." Among these Tagore highlights "identity&nbsp;[...] conceived of as ''[[dharma]].''"{{Sfn|Hogan|2000|pp=213–214}}

In ''[[Jogajog]]'' (''Relationships''), the heroine Kumudini—bound by the ideals of ''[[Śiva]]-[[Dakshayani|Sati]]'', exemplified by [[Dakshayani|Dākshāyani]]—is torn between her pity for the sinking fortunes of her progressive and compassionate elder brother and his foil: her roue of a husband. Tagore flaunts his feminist leanings; ''pathos'' depicts the plight and ultimate demise of women trapped by pregnancy, duty, and family honour; he simultaneously trucks with Bengal's putrescent landed gentry.{{Sfn|Mukherjee|2004}} The story revolves around the underlying rivalry between two families—the Chatterjees, aristocrats now on the decline (Biprodas) and the Ghosals (Madhusudan), representing new money and new arrogance. Kumudini, Biprodas' sister, is caught between the two as she is married off to Madhusudan. She had risen in an observant and sheltered traditional home, as had all her female relations.

Others were uplifting: ''Shesher Kobita''—translated twice as ''Last Poem'' and ''Farewell Song''—is his most lyrical novel, with poems and rhythmic passages written by a poet protagonist. It contains elements of satire and postmodernism and has stock characters who gleefully attack the reputation of an old, outmoded, oppressively renowned poet who, incidentally, goes by a familiar name: "Rabindranath Tagore". Though his novels remain among the least-appreciated of his works, they have been given renewed attention via film adaptations by Ray and others: ''[[Chokher Bali (film)|Chokher Bali]]'' and ''[[Ghare Baire (film)|Ghare Baire]]'' are exemplary. In the first, Tagore inscribes Bengali society via its heroine: a rebellious widow who would live for herself alone. He pillories the custom of perpetual mourning on the part of widows, who were not allowed to remarry, who were consigned to seclusion and loneliness. Tagore wrote of it: "I have always regretted the ending".{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===Poetry===
[[File:Gitanjali 11 title page.jpg|thumb|165px|Title page of the 1913 [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] edition of Tagore's ''Gitanjali''.]]
[[File:Tagore handwriting Bengali.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Three-verse handwritten composition; each verse has original Bengali with English-language translation below: "My fancies are fireflies: specks of living light twinkling in the dark. The same voice murmurs in these desultory lines, which is born in wayside pansies letting hasty glances pass by. The butterfly does not count years but moments, and therefore has enough time."|Part of a poem written by Tagore in [[Hungary]], 1926.]]

Internationally, ''Gitanjali'' ({{lang-bn|গীতাঞ্জলি}}) is Tagore's best-known collection of poetry, for which he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1913. Tagore was the first non-European to receive a Nobel Prize in Literature and second non-European to receive a Nobel Prize after [[Theodore Roosevelt]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/lists/all-nobel-prizes|title=All Nobel Prizes|publisher=Nobel Foundation|access-date=22 February 2020}}</ref>

Besides ''Gitanjali'', other notable works include ''Manasi'', ''[[Sonar Tori]]'' ("Golden Boat"), ''Balaka'' ("Wild Geese" — the title being a metaphor for migrating souls)<ref name="Dutta_1995_192">{{Harv|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=1}}</ref>

Tagore's poetic style, which proceeds from a lineage established by 15th- and 16th-century Vaishnava poets, ranges from classical formalism to the comic, visionary, and ecstatic. He was influenced by the atavistic mysticism of [[Vyasa]] and other ''rishi''-authors of the [[Upanishad]]s, the [[Bhakti]]-[[Sufism|Sufi]] mystic [[Kabir]], and [[Ramprasad Sen]].{{Sfn|Roy|1977|p=201}} Tagore's most innovative and mature poetry embodies his exposure to Bengali rural folk music, which included mystic [[Baul]] ballads such as those of the bard [[Lalon]].{{Sfn|Tagore|Stewart|Twichell|2003|p=94}}{{Sfn|Urban|2001|p=18}} These, rediscovered and repopularised by Tagore, resemble 19th-century Kartābhajā hymns that emphasise inward divinity and rebellion against bourgeois ''bhadralok'' religious and social orthodoxy.{{Sfn|Urban|2001|pp=6–7}}{{Sfn|Urban|2001|p=16}} During his Shelaidaha years, his poems took on a lyrical voice of the ''moner manush'', the Bāuls' "man within the heart" and Tagore's "life force of his deep recesses", or meditating upon the ''jeevan devata''—the demiurge or the "living God within".{{Sfn|Ghosh|2011}} This figure connected with divinity through appeal to nature and the emotional interplay of human drama. Such tools saw use in his Bhānusiṃha poems chronicling the [[Radha]]-[[Krishna]] romance, which were repeatedly revised over the course of seventy years.{{Sfn|Tagore|Stewart|Twichell|2003|p=95}}{{Sfn|Tagore|Stewart|Twichell|2003|p=7}}

Later, with the development of new poetic ideas in Bengal – many originating from younger poets seeking to break with Tagore's style – Tagore absorbed new poetic concepts, which allowed him to further develop a unique identity.  Examples of this include ''Africa'' and ''Camalia'', which are among the better known of his latter poems.

===Songs (Rabindra Sangeet)===
Tagore was a prolific composer with around 2,230 songs to his credit.<ref name="DasguptaGuha2013">{{cite book|author1=Sanjukta Dasgupta|author2=Chinmoy Guha|title=Tagore-At Home in the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8zfX4llLjyUC|date=2013|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-81-321-1084-2|page=254}}</ref> His songs are known as ''[[Rabindra Sangeet|rabindrasangit]]'' ("Tagore Song"), which merges fluidly into his literature, most of which—poems or parts of novels, stories, or plays alike—were lyricised. Influenced by the ''[[thumri]]'' style of [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani music]], they ran the entire gamut of human emotion, ranging from his early dirge-like Brahmo devotional hymns to quasi-erotic compositions.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=94}} They emulated the tonal colour of classical ''[[raga]]s'' to varying extents. Some songs mimicked a given raga's melody and rhythm faithfully; others newly blended elements of different ''ragas''.{{Sfn|Dasgupta|2001}} Yet about nine-tenths of his work was not ''bhanga gaan'', the body of tunes revamped with "fresh value" from select Western, Hindustani, Bengali folk and other regional flavours "external" to Tagore's own ancestral culture.{{Sfn|Ghosh|2011}}

In 1971, ''[[Amar Shonar Bangla]]'' became the national anthem of [[Bangladesh]]. It was written – ironically – to protest the [[1905 Partition of Bengal]] along communal lines: cutting off the Muslim-majority East Bengal from Hindu-dominated West Bengal was to avert a regional bloodbath. Tagore saw the partition as a cunning plan to stop the [[Indian independence movement|independence movement]], and he aimed to rekindle Bengali unity and tar communalism. ''[[Jana Gana Mana]]'' was written in ''[[shadhu-bhasha]]'', a Sanskritised form of Bengali, and is the first of five stanzas of the Brahmo hymn ''[[Bharot Bhagyo Bidhata]]'' that Tagore composed. It was first sung in 1911 at a Calcutta session of the [[Indian National Congress]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Tagore and Jana Gana Mana|url=http://www.countercurrents.org/comm-chatterjee310803.htm|publisher=countercurrents.org|author=Monish R. Chatterjee|date=13 August 2003}}</ref> and was adopted in 1950 by the Constituent Assembly of the Republic of India as its national anthem.

The [[Sri Lanka Matha|Sri Lanka's National Anthem]] was inspired by his work.<ref name="RB1"/>

For Bengalis, the songs' appeal, stemming from the combination of emotive strength and beauty described as surpassing even Tagore's poetry, was such that the ''Modern Review'' observed that "[t]here is in Bengal no cultured home where Rabindranath's songs are not sung or at least attempted to be sung... Even illiterate villagers sing his songs".{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=359}} Tagore influenced ''sitar'' maestro [[Vilayat Khan]] and ''[[sarod]]iyas'' Buddhadev Dasgupta and [[Amjad Ali Khan]].{{Sfn|Dasgupta|2001}}

At sixty, Tagore took up drawing and painting; successful exhibitions of his many works—which made a debut appearance in Paris upon encouragement by artists he met in the south of France{{Sfn|Tagore|1997b|p=222}}—were held throughout Europe. He was likely red-green [[protanopia|colour blind]], resulting in works that exhibited strange colour schemes and off-beat aesthetics. Tagore was influenced by numerous styles, including [[scrimshaw]] by the [[Malanggan]] people of northern [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Haida argillite carvings|Haida carvings]] from the [[Pacific Northwest]] region of North America, and woodcuts by the German [[Max Pechstein]].{{Sfn|Dyson|2001}} His artist's eye for handwriting was revealed in the simple artistic and rhythmic [[leitmotif]]s embellishing the scribbles, cross-outs, and word layouts of his manuscripts. Some of Tagore's lyrics corresponded in a synesthetic sense with particular paintings.{{Sfn|Ghosh|2011}}

{{quote|Surrounded by several painters Rabindranath had always wanted to paint. Writing and music, playwriting and acting came to him naturally and almost without training, as it did to several others in his family, and in even greater measure. But painting eluded him. Yet he tried repeatedly to master the art and there are several references to this in his early letters and reminiscence. In 1900 for instance, when he was nearing forty and already a celebrated writer, he wrote to Jagadishchandra Bose, "You will be surprised to hear that I am sitting with a sketchbook drawing. Needless to say, the pictures are not intended for any salon in Paris, they cause me not the least suspicion that the national gallery of any country will suddenly decide to raise taxes to acquire them. But, just as a mother lavishes most affection on her ugliest son, so I feel secretly drawn to the very skill that comes to me least easily." He also realized that he was using the eraser more than the pencil, and dissatisfied with the results he finally withdrew, deciding it was not for him to become a painter.<ref>[[R. Siva Kumar]] (2011) ''[[The Last Harvest: Paintings of Rabindranath Tagore]]''.</ref>}}

Teaching was often done under trees. He staffed the school, he contributed his Nobel Prize monies,{{Sfn|Roy|1977|p=175}} and his duties as steward-mentor at Santiniketan kept him busy: mornings he taught classes; afternoons and evenings he wrote the students' textbooks.{{Sfn|Tagore|Chakravarty|1961|p=27}} He fundraised widely for the school in Europe and the United States between 1919 and 1921.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=221}}

Every year, many events pay tribute to Tagore: ''Kabipranam'', his birth anniversary, is celebrated by groups scattered across the globe; the annual Tagore Festival held in Urbana, Illinois (USA); ''Rabindra Path Parikrama'' walking pilgrimages from Kolkata to Santiniketan; and recitals of his poetry, which are held on important anniversaries.{{Sfn|University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign}}{{Sfn|Chakrabarti|2001}}{{Sfn|Hatcher|2001}} Bengali culture is fraught with this legacy: from language and arts to history and politics. Amartya Sen deemed Tagore a "towering figure", a "deeply relevant and many-sided contemporary thinker".{{Sfn|Hatcher|2001}}<ref name=":0" /> Tagore's Bengali originals—the 1939 ''Rabīndra Rachanāvalī''—is canonised as one of his nation's greatest cultural treasures, and he was roped into a reasonably humble role: "the greatest poet India has produced".{{Sfn|Kämpchen|2003}}

Tagore was renowned throughout much of Europe, North America, and East Asia. He co-founded [[Dartington Hall School]], a progressive coeducational institution;{{Sfn|Farrell|2000|p=162}} in Japan, he influenced such figures as Nobel laureate [[Yasunari Kawabata]].{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=202}} In [[French Indochina|colonial Vietnam]] Tagore was a guide for the restless spirit of the radical writer and publicist [[Nguyen An Ninh]]<ref>Hue-Tam Ho Tai, ''Radicalism and the Origins of the Vietnamese Revolution'', p. 76-82</ref> Tagore's works were widely translated into English, Dutch, German, Spanish, and other European languages by Czech Indologist [[Vincenc Lesný]],{{Sfn|Cameron|2006}} French Nobel laureate [[André Gide]], Russian poet [[Anna Akhmatova]],{{Sfn|Sen|2006|p=90}} former Turkish Prime Minister [[Bülent Ecevit]],{{Sfn|Kinzer|2006}} and others. In the United States, Tagore's lecturing circuits, particularly those of 1916–1917, were widely attended and wildly acclaimed. Some controversies{{efn|Tagore was no stranger to controversy: his dealings with Indian nationalists [[Subhas Chandra Bose]]{{Sfn|Sen|1997}} and [[Rash Behari Bose]],{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=214}} his yen for Soviet Communism,{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=297}}{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|pp=214–215}} and papers confiscated from Indian nationalists in New York allegedly implicating Tagore in a plot to overthrow the Raj via German funds.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=212}} These destroyed Tagore's image—and book sales—in the United States.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=214}} His relations with and ambivalent opinion of Mussolini revolted many;{{Sfn|Kundu|2009}} close friend [[Romain Rolland]] despaired that "[h]e is abdicating his role as moral guide of the independent spirits of Europe and India".{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=273}}}} involving Tagore, possibly fictive, trashed his popularity and sales in Japan and North America after the late 1920s, concluding with his "near total eclipse" outside Bengal.{{Sfn|Sen|1997}} Yet a latent reverence of Tagore was discovered by an astonished [[Salman Rushdie]] during a trip to Nicaragua.{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=255}}

By way of translations, Tagore influenced Chileans [[Pablo Neruda]] and [[Gabriela Mistral]]; Mexican writer [[Octavio Paz]]; and Spaniards [[José Ortega y Gasset]], [[Zenobia Camprubí]], and [[Juan Ramón Jiménez]]. In the period 1914–1922, the Jiménez-Camprubí pair produced twenty-two Spanish translations of Tagore's English corpus; they heavily revised ''The Crescent Moon'' and other key titles. In these years, Jiménez developed "naked poetry".{{Sfn|Dutta|Robinson|1995|pp=254–255}} Ortega y Gasset wrote that "Tagore's wide appeal [owes to how] he speaks of longings for perfection that we all have&nbsp;[...] Tagore awakens a dormant sense of childish wonder, and he saturates the air with all kinds of enchanting promises for the reader, who&nbsp;[...] pays little attention to the deeper import of Oriental mysticism". Tagore's works circulated in free editions around 1920—alongside those of [[Plato]], [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], and [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]].

Tagore was deemed over-rated by some. [[Graham Greene]] doubted that "anyone but Mr. Yeats can still take his poems very seriously." Several prominent Western admirers—including Pound and, to a lesser extent, even Yeats—criticised Tagore's work. Yeats, unimpressed with his English translations, railed against that "Damn Tagore&nbsp;[...] We got out three good books, Sturge Moore and I, and then, because he thought it more important to see and know English than to be a great poet, he brought out sentimental rubbish and wrecked his reputation. Tagore does not know English, no Indian knows English."{{Sfn|Sen|1997}}{{Sfn|Bhattacharya|2001}} [[William Radice]], who "English[ed]" his poems, asked: "What is their place in world literature?"{{Sfn|Tagore|Radice|2004|p=26}} He saw him as "kind of counter-cultur[al]", bearing "a new kind of classicism" that would heal the "collapsed romantic confusion and chaos of the 20th [c]entury."{{Sfn|Bhattacharya|2001}}{{Sfn|Tagore|Radice|2004|pp=26–31}} The translated Tagore was "almost nonsensical",{{Sfn|Tagore|Radice|2004|pp=18–19}} and subpar English offerings reduced his trans-national appeal:

{{quote|Anyone who knows Tagore's poems in their original Bengali cannot feel satisfied with any of the translations (made with or without Yeats's help). Even the translations of his prose works suffer, to some extent, from distortion. E.M. Forster noted [of] ''The Home and the World'' [that] '[t]he theme is so beautiful,' but the charms have 'vanished in translation,' or perhaps 'in an experiment that has not quite come off.'|2=[[Amartya Sen]]|3="Tagore and His India".{{Sfn|Sen|1997}}}}

Jorasanko Thakur Bari ([[Bengali language|Bengali]]: ''House of the [[Thakur (Indian title)|Thakur]]s''; anglicised to ''Tagore'') in [[Jorasanko]], north of Kolkata, is the ancestral home of the Tagore family.

It is also the place where he spent most of his childhood and where he died on 7 August 1941.

[[Rabindra Complex]] is located in Dakkhindihi village, near [[Phultala Upazila]], {{convert|19|km}} from [[Khulna]] city, [[Bangladesh]]. It was the residence of tagores father-in-law, Beni Madhab Roy Chowdhury. Tagore family had close connection with Dakkhindihi village. The maternal ancestral home of the great poet was also situated at Dakkhindihi village, poets mother Sarada Sundari Devi and his paternal aunt by marriage Tripura Sundari Devi; was born in this village.Young tagore used to visit Dakkhindihi village with his mother to visit his maternal uncles in her mothers ancestral home. Tagore visited this place several times in his life. It has been declared as a protected archaeological site by Department of Archaeology of Bangladesh and converted into a museum. In 1995, the local administration took charge of the house and on 14 November of that year, the Rabindra Complex project was decided. Bangladesh Governments Department of Archeology has carried out the renovation work to make the house a museum titled ‘Rabindra Complex’ in 2011–12 fiscal year. The two-storey museum building has four rooms on the first floor and two rooms on the ground floor at present. The building has eight windows on the ground floor and 21 windows on the first floor. The height of the roof from the floor on the ground floor is 13 feet. There are seven doors, six windows and wall almirahs on the first floor. Over 500 books were kept in the library and all the rooms have been decorated with rare pictures of Rabindranath. Over 10,000 visitors come here every year to see the museum from different parts of the country and also from abroad, said Saifur Rahman, assistant director of the Department of Archeology in Khulna. A bust of Rabindranath Tagore is also there. Every year on 25–27 Baishakh (after the Bengali New Year Celebration), cultural programs are held here which lasts for three days.
