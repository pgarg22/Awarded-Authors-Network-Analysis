'''Luigi Pulci''' ({{IPA-it|luˈiːdʒi ˈpultʃi}}; 15 August 1432 – 11 November 1484) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[diplomat]] and [[poet]] best known for his ''[[Morgante]]'', an epic and [[parody|parodistic]] poem about a giant who is converted to [[Christianity]] by [[Roland|Orlando]] and follows the knight in many adventures.

Pulci was born in [[Florence]]. His patrons were the [[Medici]]s, especially [[Lorenzo Medici]], who sent Pulci on diplomatic missions. Even so, sometime around 1470 Pulci needed more money and went into the service of Robert Sanseverino, a northern ''[[condottiere]]''.

His brother Luca (1431–1470) was also a writer. His brother Luca's works, all in the Italian language, include ''Pistole'', ''Driadeo d'amore'', and ''Ciriffo Calvaneo''.

==''Morgante''==
{{main|Morgante}}
The poem ''Morgante'' is composed of 28 ''cantari'' (chapters) written in [[ottava rima]]. The subject was loosely derived from the [[Charlemagne|Carolingian]] epic tradition, but Pulci drew many characters and motives also from the popular poems usually sung by storytellers in Florence's [[piazza]]s and developed a rich series of comic and parodistic episodes.<ref name="testo" /> The work was commissioned by [[Lucrezia Tornabuoni]], Lorenzo Medici's mother.{{sfn|Tomas|2003|p=44}}  The poem in progress was read at the Medicis' court, where the public appreciated the funny characters, partly new, partly recreated from the epic tradition. Popular Florentine humour, [[bourgeois]] way of thinking and living, and free imagination are expressed in a language based upon the Florentine [[dialect]] and extends from criminal [[argot]] to literary or scientific Latin. This language is very far from the early [[Renaissance]] [[classicism|classicistic]] model, proposed by [[Poliziano]] in those same years in the Medicis' court.<ref name="testo">{{in lang|it}} Baldi, Giusso, Razetti, Zaccaria, ''Dal testo alla storia.
