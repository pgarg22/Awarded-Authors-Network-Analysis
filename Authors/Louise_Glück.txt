Glück was born in New York City and raised on [[Long Island]]. She began to suffer from [[anorexia nervosa]] while in high school and later overcame the illness. She attended [[Sarah Lawrence College]] and [[Columbia University]] but did not obtain a degree. In addition to being an author, she has taught poetry at several academic institutions.

Glück is often described as an autobiographical poet; her work is known for its emotional intensity and for frequently drawing on mythology or nature imagery to meditate on personal experiences and modern life. Thematically, her poems have illuminated aspects of [[psychological trauma|trauma]], desire, and nature. In doing so, they have become known for frank expressions of sadness and [[social isolation|isolation]]. Scholars have also focused on her construction of poetic personas and the relationship, in her poems, between autobiography and classical myth.

Glück is an [[adjunct professor]] and Rosenkranz Writer in Residence at [[Yale University]]. She lives in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://us.macmillan.com/author/louisegluck/|title=Louise Glück {{!}} Authors {{!}} Macmillan|website=US Macmillan|language=en-US|access-date=October 9, 2020|archive-date=June 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613094431/https://us.macmillan.com/author/louisegluck/|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Biography==

===Early life===
Louise Glück was born in New York City on April 22, 1943.

Glück's mother was of Russian Jewish descent.<ref name=":14" /> Her paternal grandparents, Terézia (née Moskovitz) and Henrik Glück, were Hungarian Jews from [[Érmihályfalva]] in what was then [[Austria-Hungary]] (present-day Romania); her grandfather ran a timber company called "Feldmann és Glück".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Kiss|first=Gábor|url=https://szombat.org/tortenelem/az-ertol-az-oceanig-a-nobel-dijas-louise-e-gluck-magyar-gyokerei|title=AZ ÉRTŐL AZ ÓCEÁNIG – A NOBEL-DÍJAS LOUISE E.

As a teenager, Glück developed [[anorexia nervosa]],<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":11" /> which became the defining challenge of her late teenage and young adult years. She has described the illness, in one essay, as the result of an effort to assert her independence from her mother.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|last=Glück|first=Louise|title=Proofs & Theories: Essays on Poetry|pages=11}}</ref> Elsewhere, she has connected her illness to the death of an elder sister, an event that occurred before she was born.<ref name=":0" /> During the fall of her senior year at [[George W.

As a result of her condition, Glück did not enroll in college as a full-time student. She has described her decision to forgo higher education in favor of therapy as necessary: "…my emotional condition, my extreme rigidity of behavior and frantic dependence on ritual made other forms of education impossible".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Glück|first=Louise|title=Proofs & Theories: Essays on Poetry|pages=13}}</ref> Instead, she took a poetry class at Sarah Lawrence College and, from 1963 to 1966, she enrolled in poetry workshops at [[Columbia University]]'s [[Columbia University School of General Studies|School of General Studies]], which offered courses for non-degree students.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Morris|first=Daniel|title=The Poetry of Louise Glück: A Thematic Introduction|pages=28}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite book|last=Haralson|first=Eric L.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=noCrAgAAQBAJ&q=%22louise+gluck%22+columbia+1963&pg=PA252|title=Encyclopedia of American Poetry: The Twentieth Century|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-76322-2|pages=252|language=en|access-date=October 8, 2020|archive-date=October 8, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201008134847/https://books.google.com/books?id=noCrAgAAQBAJ&q=%22louise+gluck%22+columbia+1963&pg=PA252|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Louise Glück 2020 Winner of Nobel Prize in Literature|url=https://arts.columbia.edu/news/louise-gl%C3%BCck-2020-winner-nobel-prize-literature|access-date=October 9, 2020|website=Columbia – School of the Arts|language=en}}</ref> While there, she studied with [[Léonie Adams]] and [[Stanley Kunitz]].

===Career===
While attending poetry workshops, Glück began to publish her poems. Her first publication was in ''[[Mademoiselle (magazine)|Mademoiselle]]'', followed soon after by poems in ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'', ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[The Atlantic|The Atlantic Monthly]]'', ''[[The Nation]]'', and other venues.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Zuba, Jesse|title=The First Book: Twentieth-Century Poetic Careers in America|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-4008-7379-1|location=Princeton|pages=128|oclc=932268118}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Ratiner|first=Steven|date=2012-12-27|title=Book World: Louise Gluck's 'Poems 1962-2012'|language=en-US|work=Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/book-world-louise-glucks-poems-1962-2012/2012/12/27/c54fa088-4a02-11e2-ad54-580638ede391_story.html|access-date=2020-10-25|issn=0190-8286}}</ref> After leaving Columbia, Glück supported herself with secretarial work.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2016/fall/feature/louise-gl%C3%BCck|title=Louise Glück|website=National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH)|language=en|access-date=April 7, 2020|archive-date=February 6, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200206103222/https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2016/fall/feature/louise-gl%C3%BCck|url-status=live}}</ref> She married Charles Hertz Jr. in 1967.<ref name=":5">{{Cite book|last=Morris|first=Daniel|title=The Poetry of Louise Gluck: A Thematic Introduction|year=2006|pages=29|quote=}}</ref> In 1968, Glück published her first collection of poems, ''Firstborn'', which received some positive critical attention. In a review, the poet [[Robert Hass]] described the book as "hard, artful, and full of pain".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Miklitsch|first=Robert|date=1982-10-01|title=Assembling a Landscape: The Poetry of Louise Gluck|url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-133018719/assembling-a-landscape-the-poetry-of-louise-gluck|journal=Hollins Critic|volume=19|issue=4|pages=1|issn=0018-3644}}</ref> However, reflecting on it in 2003, the critic Stephen Burt claimed that the collection "revealed a forceful but clotted poet, an anxious imitator of [[Robert Lowell]] and [[Sylvia Plath]]".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Burt|first=Stephen|date=September 21, 2003|title=The Laureate: Why Louise Gluck's intensely private poetry is just what the public needs|url=http://archive.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2003/09/21/the_laureate/|access-date=2020-11-25|website=The Boston Globe|language=en}}</ref> Following the publication, Glück experienced a prolonged case of writer's block, which was only cured, she has said, after 1971, when she began to teach poetry at [[Goddard College]] in Vermont.<ref name=":4" /><ref>{{Cite book|last1=Duffy|first1=John J.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uTBCXqOou0YC&q=louise+gluck+vermont+encyclopedia&pg=PA138|title=The Vermont Encyclopedia|last2=Hand|first2=Samuel B.|last3=Orth|first3=Ralph H.|date=2003|publisher=UPNE|isbn=978-1-58465-086-7|pages=138|language=en}}</ref> The poems she wrote during this time were collected in her second book, ''The House on Marshland'' (1975), which many critics have regarded as her breakthrough work, signaling her "discovery of a distinctive voice".<ref name=":6">{{Cite book|last=Morris|first=Daniel|title=The Poetry of Louise Glück: A Thematic Introduction|pages=4}}</ref>

In 1973, Glück gave birth to a son, Noah.<ref name=":1" /> Her marriage to Charles Hertz Jr. ended in divorce, and in 1977 she married John Dranow, an author who had started the summer writing program at Goddard College.<ref name=":5" /><ref name=":7">{{Cite web|last=Flagg|first=Kathryn|title=Vermont's Struggling Culinary School Plans Its Next Course|url=https://www.sevendaysvt.com/vermont/vermonts-struggling-culinary-school-plans-its-next-course/Content?oid=2332056|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180908061835/https://www.sevendaysvt.com/vermont/vermonts-struggling-culinary-school-plans-its-next-course/Content?oid=2332056|archive-date=September 8, 2018|access-date=April 7, 2020|website=Seven Days|language=en}}</ref> In 1980, Dranow and Francis Voigt, the husband of poet [[Ellen Bryant Voigt]], co-founded the [[New England Culinary Institute]] as a private, for-profit college. Glück and Bryant Voigt were early investors in the institute and served on its board of directors.<ref name=":7" />

In 1980, Glück's third collection, ''Descending Figure'', was published. It received some criticism for its tone and subject matter: for example, the poet [[Greg Kuzma]] accused Glück of being a "child hater" for her now anthologized poem, "The Drowned Children".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=George|first=E.

In the wake of that tragedy, Glück began to write the poems that would later be collected in her award-winning work, ''[[The Triumph of Achilles]]'' (1985). Writing in ''The New York Times'', the author and critic [[Liz Rosenberg]] described the collection as "clearer, purer, and sharper" than Glück's previous work.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Rosenberg|first=Liz|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/22/books/geckos-porch-lights-and-sighing-gardens.html|title=Geckos, Porch Lights and Sighing Gardens|date=December 22, 1985|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 7, 2020|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=April 7, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200407220633/https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/22/books/geckos-porch-lights-and-sighing-gardens.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The critic Peter Stitt, writing in ''[[The Georgia Review]]'', declared that the book showed Glück to be "among the important poets of our age".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stitt|first=Peter|date=1985|title=Contemporary American Poems: Exclusive and Inclusive|journal=The Georgia Review|volume=39|issue=4|pages=849–863|jstor=41398888|issn=0016-8386}}</ref> From the collection, the poem "Mock Orange", which has been likened to a feminist anthem,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blog.pshares.org/index.php/speaking-against-silence/|title=Speaking Against Silence|last=Abel|first=Colleen|date=January 15, 2019|website=The Ploughshares Blog|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200407220638/http://blog.pshares.org/index.php/speaking-against-silence/|archive-date=April 7, 2020|access-date=April 7, 2020}}</ref> has been called an "anthology piece" because of its frequent inclusion in poetry anthologies and college courses.<ref name=":13">{{Cite journal|last=Hahn|first=Robert|date=Summer 2004|title=Transporting the Wine of Tone: Louise Gluck in Italian|journal=Michigan Quarterly Review|volume=XLIII|issue=3|hdl=2027/spo.act2080.0043.313 |hdl-access=free |issn=1558-7266}}</ref>

While the 1990s brought Glück literary success, it was also a period of personal hardship.

In 1994, she published a collection of essays called ''Proofs & Theories: Essays on Poetry''. She then produced ''Meadowlands'' (1996), a collection of poetry about the nature of love and the deterioration of a marriage.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/louise-gluck|title=Louise Glück|website=Poetry Foundation|access-date=October 8, 2020|archive-date=August 29, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200829201741/https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/louise-gluck|url-status=live}}</ref> She followed it with two more collections: ''Vita Nova'' (1999) and ''The Seven Ages'' (2001).

In 2004, in response to the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001]], Glück published a [[chapbook]] entitled ''October''. Consisting of one poem divided into six parts, it draws on ancient Greek myth to explore aspects of trauma and suffering.<ref>{{Citation|last=Azcuy|first=Mary Kate|title=Persona, Trauma and Survival in Louise Glück's Postmodern, Mythic, Twenty-First-Century 'October'|date=2011|work=Crisis and Contemporary Poetry|pages=33–49|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|language=en|doi=10.1057/9780230306097_3|isbn=978-0-230-30609-7}}</ref> That same year, she was named the Rosenkranz Writer in Residence at Yale University.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2004/11/09/gluck-waxes-poetic-on-work/|title=Gluck waxes poetic on work|last=Speirs|first=Stephanie|date=November 9, 2004|website=yaledailynews.com|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200407220635/https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2004/11/09/gluck-waxes-poetic-on-work/|archive-date=April 7, 2020|access-date=April 7, 2020}}</ref>

Since joining the faculty of Yale, Glück has continued to publish poetry. Her books published during this period include ''Averno'' (2006), ''A Village Life'' (2009), and ''[[Faithful and Virtuous Night]]'' (2014). In 2012, the publication of a collection of a half-century's worth of her poems, entitled ''Poems: 1962–2012'', was called "a literary event".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theamericanscholar.org/creative-paralysis/|title=Creative Paralysis|date=December 6, 2013|website=The American Scholar|language=en-US|access-date=April 7, 2020|archive-date=April 7, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200407220636/https://theamericanscholar.org/creative-paralysis/|url-status=live}}</ref> Another collection of her essays, entitled ''American Originality'', appeared in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29939146-american-originality|title=American Originality: Essays on Poetry|website=Good Reads|access-date=October 8, 2020|archive-date=July 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702195609/http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29939146-american-originality|url-status=live}}</ref>

Glück's work has been, and continues to be, the subject of academic study. Her papers, including manuscripts, correspondence, and other materials, are housed at the [[Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library|Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library]] at Yale University.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archives.yale.edu/repositories/11/resources/5489/collection_organization|title=Collection: Louise Glück papers {{!}} Archives at Yale|website=archives.yale.edu|access-date=April 7, 2020|archive-date=April 7, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200407220645/https://archives.yale.edu/repositories/11/resources/5489/collection_organization|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Form ===
Glück is best known for lyric poems of linguistic precision and dark tone. The poet [[Craig Morgan Teicher]] has described her as a writer for whom "words are always scarce, hard won, and not to be wasted".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Teicher|first=Craig Morgan|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/04/books/review/a-little-book-on-form-robert-hass-american-originality-louise-gluck.html|title=Deep Dives Into How Poetry Works (and Why You Should Care)|date=August 4, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 7, 2020|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=April 7, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200407220636/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/04/books/review/a-little-book-on-form-robert-hass-american-originality-louise-gluck.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The scholar Laura Quinney has argued that her careful use of words has put Glück into "the line of American poets who value fierce lyric compression," from [[Emily Dickinson]] to [[Elizabeth Bishop]].<ref name=":9">{{Cite journal|url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v27/n14/laura-quinney/like-dolls-with-their-heads-cut-off|title=Laura Quinney · Like Dolls with Their Heads Cut Off: Louise Glück · LRB 21 July 2005|last=Quinney|first=Laura|date=July 21, 2005|journal=London Review of Books|volume=27|issue=14|language=en|access-date=April 7, 2020|archive-date=April 7, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200407220636/https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v27/n14/laura-quinney/like-dolls-with-their-heads-cut-off|url-status=live}}</ref> Glück's poems have shifted in form throughout her career, beginning with short, terse lyrics composed of compact lines and expanding into connected book-length sequences.<ref>{{Cite book|editor-last=Cucinella |editor-first=Catherine |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/556e/88d648e8b39637eb4a33c8bae81334a83c66.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200211164418/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/556e/88d648e8b39637eb4a33c8bae81334a83c66.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2020-02-11 |title=Contemporary American Women Poets: An A-to-Z Guide|journal=Choice Reviews Online |publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2002|volume=40 |issue=10 |isbn=978-1-4294-7550-1|location=Westport|pages=150–151|doi=10.5860/choice.40-5534 |s2cid=160036481 |oclc=144590762}}</ref> Her work is not known for poetic techniques such as rhyme or alliteration. Rather, the poet Robert Hahn has called her style "radically inconspicuous" or "virtually an absence of style", relying on a voice that blends "portentous intonations" with a conversational approach.<ref name=":13" />

Among scholars and reviewers, there has been discussion as to whether Glück is a [[Confessional poetry|confessional poet]], owing to the prevalence of the first-person mode in her poems and their intimate subject matter, often inspired by events in Glück's personal life. The scholar Robert Baker has argued that Glück "is surely a confessional poet in some basic sense",<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baker|first=Robert|date=June 1, 2018|title=Versions of Ascesis in Louise Glück's Poetry|url=https://academic.oup.com/camqtly/article/47/2/131/5026611|journal=The Cambridge Quarterly|language=en|volume=47|issue=2|pages=131–154|doi=10.1093/camqtly/bfy011|s2cid=165358842|issn=0008-199X|access-date=April 7, 2020|archive-date=October 8, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201008134912/https://academic.oup.com/camqtly/article-abstract/47/2/131/5026611?redirectedFrom=fulltext|url-status=live}}</ref> while the critic Michael Robbins has argued that Glück's poetry, unlike that of confessional poets [[Sylvia Plath]] or [[John Berryman]], "depends upon the fiction of privacy".<ref name=":10">{{Cite web|url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/the-constant-gardener-on-louise-gluck/|title=The Constant Gardener: On Louise Glück|last=Robbins|first=Michael|website=Los Angeles Review of Books|date=December 4, 2012|access-date=April 7, 2020|archive-date=August 7, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200807103501/https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/the-constant-gardener-on-louise-gluck|url-status=live}}</ref> In other words, she cannot be a confessional poet, Robbins argues, if she does not address an audience. Going further, Quinney argues that, to Glück, the confessional poem is "odious".<ref name=":9" /> Others have noted that Glück's poems can be viewed as autobiographical, while her technique of inhabiting various personas, ranging from ancient Greek gods to garden flowers, renders her poems more than mere confessions. As the scholar [[Helen Vendler]] has noted: "In their obliquity and reserve, [Glück's poems] offer an alternative to first-person 'confession', while remaining indisputably personal".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Vendler|first=Helen|title=Part of Nature, Part of Us: Modern American Poets|url=https://archive.org/details/partofnaturepart0004vend|url-access=registration|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1980|isbn=978-0-674-65476-1|location=Cambridge|pages=[https://archive.org/details/partofnaturepart0004vend/page/311 311]}}</ref>

=== Themes ===
While Glück's work is thematically diverse, scholars and critics have identified several themes that are paramount. Most prominently, Glück's poetry can be said to focus on trauma, as she has written throughout her career about death, loss, suffering, failed relationships, and attempts at healing and renewal.<ref>{{Cite book|editor-last=Cucinella |editor-first=Catherine |title=Contemporary American Women Poets: An A-to-Z Guide|year=2002|pages=149|quote=Wounds--the death of a firstborn child, anorexia, failed relationships, sibling rivalry, a parent's death, divorce--form the foundation from which Glück's poetry arises.}}</ref> The scholar Daniel Morris notes that even a Glück poem that uses traditionally happy or idyllic imagery "suggests the author's awareness of mortality, of the loss of innocence".<ref name=":6" /> The scholar Joanne Feit Diehl echoes this notion when she argues that "this 'sense of an ending'… infuses Glück's poems with their retrospective power", pointing to her transformation of common objects, such as a baby stroller, into representations of loneliness and loss.<ref>{{Cite book|title=On Louise Glück: Change What You See|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-472-11479-5|editor-last=Diehl|editor-first=Joanne Feit|location=Ann Arbor|pages=6–7}}</ref> Yet, for Glück, trauma is arguably a gateway to a greater appreciation of life, a concept explored in ''The Triumph of Achilles''. The triumph to which the title alludes is Achilles' acceptance of mortality—which enables him to become a more fully realized human being.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.bestamericanpoetry.com/the_best_american_poetry/2012/01/the-ambivalence-of-being-in-glucks-the-triumph-of-achilles-opening-the-box-opening-the-book-opening-the-self-what-ofte.html|title="The Ambivalence of Being in Gluck's The Triumph of Achilles" [by Caroline Malone]|website=The Best American Poetry|access-date=April 7, 2020|archive-date=April 7, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200407220638/https://blog.bestamericanpoetry.com/the_best_american_poetry/2012/01/the-ambivalence-of-being-in-glucks-the-triumph-of-achilles-opening-the-box-opening-the-book-opening-the-self-what-ofte.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Another of Glück's common themes is desire. Glück has written directly about many forms of desire—for example, the desire for love or insight—but her approach is marked by ambivalence. Morris argues that Glück's poems, which often adopt contradictory points of view, reflect "her own ambivalent relationship to status, power, morality, gender, and, most of all, language".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Morris|first=Daniel|title=The Poetry of Louise Glück: A Thematic Introduction|pages=73}}</ref> The author Robert Boyer has characterized Glück's ambivalence as a result of "strenuous self-interrogation". He argues that "Glück's poems at their best have always moved between recoil and affirmation, sensuous immediacy and reflection … for a poet who can often seem earthbound and defiantly unillusioned, she has been powerfully responsive to the lure of the daily miracle and the sudden upsurge of overmastering emotion".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Boyers|first=Robert|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/writing-without-mattress-louise-glueck/|title=Writing Without a Mattress: On Louise Glück|date=November 20, 2012|work=The Nation|access-date=April 7, 2020|url-status=live|language=en-US|issn=0027-8378|archive-date=April 7, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200407220634/https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/writing-without-mattress-louise-glueck/}}</ref> The tension between competing desires in Glück's work manifests both in her assumption of different personas from poem to poem and in her varied approach to each collection of her poems. This has led the poet and scholar [[James Longenbach]] to declare that "change is Louise Glück's highest value" and "if change is what she most craves, it is also what she most resists, what is most difficult for her, most hard-won".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Longenbach|first=James|date=1999|title=Louise Glück's Nine Lives|journal=Southwest Review|volume=84|issue=2|pages=184–198|jstor=43472558|issn=0038-4712}}</ref>

Another of Glück's preoccupations is nature, the setting for many of her poems. In ''The Wild Iris'', the poems take place in a garden where flowers have intelligent, emotive voices. However, Morris points out that ''The House on Marshland'' is also concerned with nature and can be read as a revision of the [[Romantic poetry|Romantic]] tradition of nature poetry.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Morris|first=Daniel|title=The Poetry of Louise Glück: A Thematic Introduction|pages=2}}</ref> In ''Ararat'', too, "flowers become a language of mourning", useful for both commemoration and competition among mourners to determine the "ownership of nature as a meaningful system of symbolism".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Morris|first=Daniel|title=The Poetry of Louise Glück: A Thematic Introduction|pages=6}}</ref> Thus, in Glück's work nature is both something to be regarded critically and embraced. As the author and critic [[Alan Williams (novelist)|Alan Williamson]] has pointed out, it can also sometimes suggest the divine, as when, in the poem "Celestial Music", the speaker states that "when you love the world you hear celestial music", or when, in ''The Wild Iris'', the deity speaks through changes in weather.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Williamson, Alan|title=On Louise Glück: Change What You See|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=2005|editor-last=Diehl|editor-first=Joanne Feit|location=Ann Arbor|pages=65–66|chapter=Splendor and Mistrust}}</ref>

Glück's poetry is also notable for what it avoids. Morris argues that "Glück's writing most often evades ethnic identification, religious classification, or gendered affiliation. In fact, her poetry often negates critical assessments that affirm [[identity politics]] as criteria for literary evaluation. She resists canonization as a hyphenated poet (that is, as a "Jewish-American" poet, or a "feminist" poet, or a "nature" poet), preferring instead to retain an aura of iconoclasm, or in-betweenness".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Morris|first=Daniel|title=The Poetry of Louise Glück: A Thematic Introduction|pages=30–31}}</ref>

=== Influences ===
Glück has pointed to the influence of [[psychoanalysis]] on her work, as well as her early learning in ancient legends, parables, and mythology. In addition, she has credited the influence of Léonie Adams and Stanley Kunitz. Scholars and critics have pointed to the literary influence on her work of Robert Lowell,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.literarymatters.org/10-1-sounding-lowell-louise-gluck-and-derek-walcott/|title=Sounding Lowell: Louise Glück and Derek Walcott|last=Gargaillo, Florian|date=September 29, 2017|website=Literary Matters|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200407220637/https://www.literarymatters.org/10-1-sounding-lowell-louise-gluck-and-derek-walcott/|archive-date=April 7, 2020|access-date=April 7, 2020}}</ref> [[Rainer Maria Rilke]],<ref name=":10" /> and [[Emily Dickinson]],<ref>{{Cite book|last=Diehl|first=Joanne Feit|title=On Louise Glück: Change What You See|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=2005|editor-last=Diehl|editor-first=Joanne Feit|location=Ann Arbor|pages=13, 20|chapter=Introduction}}</ref> among others.
