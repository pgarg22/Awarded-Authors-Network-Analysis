==Career==


Gordon Porterfield was the key playwright in residence at Baltimore's [[Corner Theatre ETC]], which was founded in 1968 by [[Ellen Stewart]] and Leslie Irons as an [[experimental theatre]] whose principal goal was the production of new plays. Porterfield's output was impressive by any standard, creating literally dozens of works both short and full-length. ''Authors'' and the apocalyptic ''The Earth Is Dead'' - an evening of one-acts under the collective title ''Ratsfeet,'' were the first Porterfield plays offered by the theatre, followed in very short order with a full-length play ''Universal Nigger (1969),'' which told the story of a modern-day [[African-American]] [[Christ]], following his movements through the stations of the cross. The production was highly controversial and drew large crowds.<ref name="bradmays">{{cite web|url=http://bradmays.com/print/patronsrefusal.jpg|date=2010-04-21|title=Image: patronsrefusal.jpg, (1014 × 1224 px)|publisher=bradmays.com|access-date=2015-09-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal   | last = Gardner   | first = R.H. | title = Patron's Refusal To Co-Operate Cuts Play Short Before Big Scene ('''Article''')   | journal = The Baltimore Sun   }}]</ref>  The following year, [[Brooklyn]]'s [[Chelsea Theater Center]] acquired the rights to ''Universal Nigger'' and produced it in their own space for [[New York City]] audiences, under the direction of [[Robert Kalfin]]. ''Gnomes,'' a collection of thirteen short one-act plays, was presented the following year. Director Michael Makarovich subsequently staged two Gordon Porterfield one-acts at Corner: ''The Catcher Was A Fag'' and ''I And Silence Some Strange Race;''<ref name="bradmays2">{{cite web|url=http://bradmays.com/print/porterfieldnewsamerican.jpg|date=2010-04-21|title=Image: porterfieldnewsamerican.jpg, (720 × 1574 px)|publisher=bradmays.com|access-date=2015-09-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal   | last = Scheye   | first = Thomas   | title = Porterfied's Plays Just About His Best   | journal = Baltimore News American   | date = November 20, 1969   }}</ref> as well as an original teleplay entitled ''Tigers.''

In 1972, Corner Theatre presented what many considered Porterfield's defining  work for that time, a scatological romp down the Yellow Brick Road entitled {{not a typo|''whatisoneholycatholicapostalicbrownandstinksuptheuniverse.''}} 1973 saw the production of another evening of one-acts, entitled  ''Wolves.''<ref name="bradmays3">{{cite web|url=http://bradmays.com/print/wolvesreview.jpg|date=2010-04-21|title=Image: wolvesreview.jpg, (1440 × 1265 px)|publisher=bradmays.com|access-date=2015-09-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal   | last = Yeager   | first = Steve   | title = Corner offers stinging Porterfield production ('''Review''')   | journal = Performance   | pages = 15   | date = April 5, 1973   }}]</ref>  ''Chancre,'' a hallucinatory tour de force, was Porterfield's final offering at the Corner Theatre.

In 1987 ''The Yippie Book,'' Porterfield's instructional work for educators, was published by Perfection Form Co.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://openlibrary.org/b/OL13592601M/yippee-book|title=The yippee book (Open Library)|work=openlibrary.org}}</ref> Twelve years later, Porterfield came out of theatrical retirement with the critically acclaimed play ''Snow,'' which was performed at the completely reformed version of his old stomping grounds, the '''Fells Point Corner Theatre'''.<ref name="citypaper">{{cite web|url=http://citypaper.com/arts/story.asp?id=4473 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040808003052/http://www.citypaper.com/arts/story.asp?id=4473 |archive-date=2004-08-08 |url-status=dead |title=Let It Snow: Festival Awards Honor an FPCT Production &#124; Baltimore City Paper |access-date=2015-09-05 }}</ref>
