His entrance to theatre was marked with his 1962 play ''Who'll Save the Plowboy?'' at the [[off-Broadway]] [[Phoenix Theatre (New York)|Phoenix Theatre]], which won the [[Obie Award]].<ref>[http://www.lortel.org/LLA_archive/index.cfm?search_by=show&id=4353 "''Who'll Save the Plowboy?'' Listing"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002211637/http://www.lortel.org/LLA_archive/index.cfm?search_by=show&id=4353 |date=2007-10-02 }} lortel.org, accessed September 14, 2015</ref> The play follows Albert Cobb, a man who once dreamed of owning a farm, becoming a plowboy. He and his wife Helen are awaiting to be reunited fifteen years after World War II, along with Larry Doyle, the man who saved his life.

''[[The Subject Was Roses]]'' premiered on Broadway on May 25, 1964 and closed on May 21, 1966.<ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/show.php?id=8383 "''The Subject WasRoses''"] ibdb.com, accessed September 14, 2015</ref> The two-act play has been compared to [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s ''[[Long Day's Journey Into Night]]''.<ref>McCaffrey, Lawrence J.

Syracuse University Press.</ref>  [[Walter Kerr]] said of the show: "a family triangle in which a father loves a son and the mother loves that son and the son loves both mother and father and not one of them can make a move or utter a sound that does not instantly damage the other."<ref>{{cite book |last=Coy|first=Stephen C.|title=Twentieth-Century American Dramatists|year=1981 |publisher=Gale|location=[[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] |isbn=978-0-8103-0928-9}}</ref>
