'''Barbara Louise Mertz''' (September 29, 1927 – August 8, 2013) was an American author who wrote under her own name as well as under the pseudonyms '''Elizabeth Peters''' and '''Barbara Michaels'''.  In 1952, she received a PhD in [[Egyptology]] from the [[University of Chicago]].  While she was best known for her mystery and suspense novels, in the 1960s she authored two books on ancient Egypt, both of which have remained in print ever since.

Under the name Barbara Michaels, she wrote primarily [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] and supernatural [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]]s. Her publisher chose that pseudonym since Mertz had already published one non-fiction book on ancient Egypt, and the publisher did not want Mertz's novels to be confused with her academic work. Under the pseudonym Elizabeth Peters, Mertz published mysteries, including her [[Amelia Peabody]] [[historical mystery]] series, using a ''nom de plume'' drawn from the names of her two children.

She was member of the Editorial Advisory Board of ''[[Kmt (journal)|KMT]]'', ("A Modern Journal of Ancient Egypt"), [[Egypt Exploration Society]], and the [[James Henry Breasted]] Circle of the [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mpmbooks.com/bio.html |title= (Barbara Mertz / Elizabeth Peters / Barbara Michaels) Biography in her own words |website=mpmbooks.com |access-date=November 28, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119110753/http://mpmbooks.com/bio.html |archive-date=January 19, 2009}}</ref>

Mertz was also a feminist, a topic that frequently arose in her fiction, and in her professional life.

===Fiction written as Elizabeth Peters===

====Amelia Peabody====
{{main|Amelia Peabody series}}
This series contains 20 books; the most recent and last, ''[[The Painted Queen]]'', was published in July 2017.
The [[heroine]] is an Egyptologist and is married, with one child of her body, Walter, nicknamed and popularly known as Ramses, and two others of her heart: Nefret Forth (3 years older than Ramses) and Sennia (ca. 25 years younger). The stories all relate to the "Golden Age" of Egyptology and nearly all are set in [[Egypt]], with the excavations providing the backdrop for the mystery/adventure plots.

The timeline begins in the 1880s with Amelia's decision to see the world as an unexpectedly wealthy feminist spinster, and ends with the discovery of [[Tutankhamun]]'s tomb in late 1922. (Peters had planned additional books in the series to "fill in the blanks" in the chronology, as she did with ''River'': set in 1910, though it was written after other books that are set later.)

Additionally: ''[[Amelia Peabody's Egypt: A Compendium]]'' – (with Kristen Whitbread) Published October 2003

====Vicky Bliss====
{{main|The Vicky Bliss Mysteries}}
The Vicky Bliss novels follow the adventures of an American professor of art history, who keeps getting involved in international crime, and her love interest, a charming art thief known as Sir John Smythe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/9/9/1236502/-Monday-Murder-Mystery-Elizabeth-Peter-s-Vicky-Bliss |title=Monday Murder Mystery: Elizabeth Peter's Vicky Bliss |newspaper=Dailykos.com |date=September 9, 2013 |author=Michelewin |access-date=November 28, 2016}}</ref> Another Peters novel, ''The Camelot Caper'' (1969) (also published as ''Her Cousin John''), while not technically a Vicky Bliss story, features Smythe. The novels can be enjoyed in any order, but the stories are highly sequential in nature and are probably better appreciated if read in order of publication.

#''The Camelot Caper'' (1969) (another title - ''Her Cousin John'')
#''Borrower of the Night'' (1973)
#''Street of the Five Moons'' (1978)
#''Silhouette in Scarlet'' (1983)
#''Trojan Gold'' (1987)
#''Night Train to Memphis'' (1994)
#''The Laughter of Dead Kings'' (2008)

This series and the Amelia Peabody series are slightly related: a fictional tomb discovered by Amelia Peabody and her husband plays an important role in ''Night Train to Memphis'', and in ''The Laughter of Dead Kings'' it is revealed that John Smythe is related to the Emersons.

==== Jacqueline Kirby ====
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
In this series, Jacqueline Kirby is a middle-aged librarian with a very large purse and a knack for solving mysteries. Initially an unwilling detective, and not the apparent protagonist, in the first book (''The Seventh Sinner''), Kirby's quirkiness and middle-aged romantic success generated a following and led to sequels. The series continued with ''The Murders of Richard III'' and ''Die For Love'', each of which featured Jacqueline Kirby plumbing a mystery arising out of a subculture ([[wikt:Ricardian|Ricardian]]s and romance novelists). In ''Die for Love'', Kirby began writing a romance novel, and in ''Naked Once More'', the fourth and final book of the series, has proven to be quite successful in that career. In ''Naked Once More'', Jacqueline is commissioned to write a sequel to a "famous" prehistoric romance novel, whose author died under mysterious circumstances. In each of the books, Kirby solves a mystery, attracts one or more suitors, but remains alluringly aloof and independent.
