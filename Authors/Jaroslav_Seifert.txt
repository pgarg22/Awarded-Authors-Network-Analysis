'''Jaroslav Seifert''' ({{IPA-cs|ˈjaroslaf ˈsajfr̩t|lang|Jaroslav seifert.ogg}}; 23 September 1901 – 10 January 1986) was a [[Czechs|Czech]] writer, poet and journalist. In 1984 Seifert won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] "for his poetry which endowed with freshness, sensuality and rich inventiveness provides a liberating image of the indomitable spirit and versatility of man".<ref>"[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1984/ The Nobel Prize in Literature 1984]".

==Biography==
Born in [[Žižkov]], a suburb of [[Prague]] in what was then part of [[Austria-Hungary]], Seifert's first collection of poems was published in 1921. He was a member of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] (KSČ), the editor of a number of communist newspapers and magazines – ''Rovnost'', ''Sršatec'', and ''Reflektor'' – and the employee of a communist publishing house.

During the 1920s he was considered a leading representative of the Czechoslovakian artistic avant-garde. He was one of the founders of the journal [[Devětsil]]. In March 1929, he and six other writers left the KSČ after signing a manifesto protesting against [[Bolshevik]] Stalinist-influenced tendencies in the new leadership of the party. He subsequently worked as a journalist in the social-democratic and trade union press during the 1930s and 1940s.

In 1949 Seifert left journalism and began to devote himself exclusively to literature. His poetry was awarded important state prizes in 1936, 1955, and 1968, and in 1967 he was designated National Artist. He was the official Chairman of the Czechoslovak Writer's Union for several years (1968–70). In 1977 he was one of the signatories of [[Charter 77]] in opposition to the government of the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Amrit|author-link=Amrit Wilson|date=1986-02-01|title=News & notes|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03064228608534032|journal=[[Index on Censorship]]|volume=15|issue=2|pages=3–6|doi=10.1080/03064228608534032|s2cid=220929273|issn=0306-4220}}</ref>

Seifert was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1984. Due to bad health, he was not present at the award ceremony, and so his daughter received the Nobel Prize in his name. Even though it was a matter of great importance, there was only a brief remark of the award in the state-controlled media. He died in 1986, aged 84, and was buried at the municipal cemetery in [[Kralupy nad Vltavou]] (where his maternal grandparents originated from).

His burial was marked by a high presence of secret police, who tried to suppress any hint of dissent on the part of mourners.<ref>[http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1986/Dissidents-And-Authorities-Say-Farewell-To-Nobel-Laureate/id-8feb8b7ef1f1bd7a56804771779831e4 Dissidents And Authorities Say Farewell To Nobel Laureate]</ref>
