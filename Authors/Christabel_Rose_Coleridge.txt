'''Christabel Rose Coleridge''' (25 May 1843 – 14 November 1921) was an English [[novelist]] and an editor of girls' magazines, sometimes in collaboration with the novelist [[Charlotte Mary Yonge]]. Her views on the role of women in society were conservative.

==Early life==
A grand-daughter of the poet, [[Samuel Coleridge]], Christabel was born at St Mark's College, [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], while her father, [[Derwent Coleridge|Derwent]], was headmaster there. Her name pays homage to [[Samuel Coleridge]]'s poem "[[Christabel (poem)|Christabel]]". For a time, Coleridge helped her brother [[Ernest Hartley Coleridge|Ernest]] to run a school, but her ambition was to be a writer.

==Writings, friendships==
She went on to publish more than 15 novels. The first was a children's historical story called ''Lady Betty'' (1869). ''Minstrel Dick'' (1896) is set mainly in the 14th-century [[Berkhamstead]] court of the dying [[Edward, the Black Prince]]. Her fiction expressed her concern with morality, and several of her books were published by the [[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge]].

Christabel was a friend of Charlotte Yonge's, distantly related to her through [[Mary Elizabeth Coleridge]], who like Christabel had been one of Yonge's informal society, the Goslings.<ref>[http://www.dur.ac.uk/c.e.schultze/context/goslings.html "The Gosling Society 1859–1877"]. ''The Charlotte Mary Yonge Fellowship''. Durham University Community. Retrieved 15 July 2012.</ref> They collaborated on several writing projects, such as ''The Miz Maze or The Winkworth Puzzle: A Story in Letters, by Nine Authors'' (1883).<ref>Her eight collaborators were Charlotte Mary Yonge, [[John Wither Awdry|Frances Awdry]], Mary Bramston, A. E. Mary Anderson Morshead, Frances Mary Peard, [[Mary Susanna Lee]], Eleanor C. Price, and Florence Wilford.

In the early 1890s, Christabel and her "[[Mother Goose]]" edited ''[[The Monthly Packet]]'', which Yonge had founded 40 years earlier as an [[Anglican]] magazine for middle-class girls, as ''The Monthly Packet of Evening Readings for Younger Members of the English Church''. Coleridge was the sole editor during its last six years, from 1894 to 1899. She also edited a magazine intended for the working-class members of the [[Church of England|church]]-based [[Girls' Friendly Society]]. After Yonge's death she wrote and edited the biographical ''Charlotte Mary Yonge: Her Life and Letters'' (1903).

Another friend was [[Frances Mary Peard]] (1835–1923), who wrote more than 40 books published from 1867 to 1909, mostly domestic novels and short-story volumes.<ref>"Getting Into Print: Frances Mary Peard, 1835–1922".

==Life's work==
Christabel Rose Coleridge had at least 89 works of hers published in a total of at least 286 publications.<ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n90619228/ OCLC WorldCat Identities. Retrieved 25 February 2020.]</ref>

In 1880, Christabel moved to Torquay when her father retired there. She had conservative ideas about the role of women in society, and a collection of her essays on the subject was published in 1894, ''The Daughters Who Have Not Revolted''. Her last novel, ''Miss Lucy: A Character Study'', was published in 1908.<ref>[http://explore.bl.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/dlDisplay.do?vid=BLVU1&docId=BLL01000741956 "Miss Lucy. A character study..., 1908."] Main catalogue, [[British Library]]. Retrieved 8 June 2016.</ref>

Christabel Rose Coleridge's life ended on 14 November 1921 in Torquay, Devon, at the age of 78.
