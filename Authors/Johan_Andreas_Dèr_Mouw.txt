'''Johan Andreas Dèr Mouw''' (24 July 1863 – 8 July 1919) was a Dutch poet and philosopher. During Dèr Mouw's life only some of his poems were published in literary journals.

==Life and career==
Dèr Mouw was born in [[Westervoort]]. His father Jacob Cornelis der Mouw (orig. Dermauw) was for a short period insurance agent and bookseller; his mother Anna Elisabeth Zillinger was director of a school in [[Deventer]]. Dèr Mouw attended the [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] (grammar school) in Deventer and studied at [[Leiden University]] from 1883 up to 1887, where he took up Greek, Latin, Sanskrit and philosophy. After graduating, Dèr Mouw got a job as teacher at the Gymnasium in [[Doetinchem]].
He defended his doctoral [[dissertation]] (''Quomodo Antiqui Naturam mirati sunt?'') at Leiden University in 1890. In 1893 Dèr Mouw married Hendrika van Enst. Their stepdaughter Teuntje Vink was later renamed Hetty der Mouw.
Dèr Mouw's companionship with the son of the headmaster of the Gymnasium in Doetinchem led to a conflict. He was sued and convicted for insulting the headmaster. (His attorney was [[Pieter Jelles Troelstra]]). In the course of the scandal Dèr Mouw tried to commit suicide. Afterwards, Dèr Mouw moved to [[Rijswijk]] in 1904, and later to [[The Hague]], where he supported his family by giving private tuition. He devoted the rest of his life to writing poetry and studying philosophy. He published two books on philosophy, with special attention to [[Hegel]].

==Poetry==
The poetry of Dèr Mouw is special, because he manages to express his mystical view on the world in clear words, that have a down-to-earth appeal. This can be seen in one of his most famous poems: ''I'm Brahman. But we are without a maid''. Dèr Mouw published some of his poems in literary magazines, and was immediately recognised as an important poet by writers like [[Frederik van Eeden]] and [[Albert Verwey]]. Poets like [[P.C. Boutens]] and [[J. H. Leopold|J.H. Leopold]] shared his interest for eastern mysticism.
Dèr Mouw's didn't live to see his first book, ''Brahman I'', come to light. It  was published within a few weeks after his death, in July 1919.

Letters and manuscripts of J.A. Dèr Mouw are being kept in the Nederlands Letterkundig Museum in The Hague.
