'''Chester Simon Kallman''' (January 7, 1921 – January 18, 1975) was an [[Americans|American]] [[poet]], librettist, and translator, best known for collaborating with [[W. H. Auden]] on opera librettos for [[Igor Stravinsky]] and other composers.

==Life==

Kallman was born in [[Brooklyn]] of [[Ashkenazi]] [[Jewish]] ancestry. He received his B.A. at [[Brooklyn College]] and his M.A. at the [[University of Michigan]]. He published three collections of poems, ''Storm at Castelfranco'' (1956), ''Absent and Present'' (1963), and ''The Sense of Occasion'' (1971). He lived most of his adult life in New York, spending his summers in Italy from 1948 through 1957 and in [[Austria]] from 1958 through 1974.

In 1963 he moved his winter home from New York to [[Athens]], Greece. He died there of a heart attack on January 18, 1975, eleven days after his 54th birthday.<ref>

==Career==

Together with his lifelong friend (and sometime lover<ref>{{cite book | last=Mendelson | first=Edward | authorlink=Edward Mendelson | title=Later Auden | url=https://archive.org/details/laterauden0000mend | url-access=registration | publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux | location=New York | year=1999 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/laterauden0000mend/page/46 46] | isbn=0-374-18408-9}}</ref>) [[W. H. Auden]], Kallman wrote the libretto for Stravinsky's ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'' (1951). They also collaborated on two librettos for [[Hans Werner Henze]], ''[[Elegy for Young Lovers]]'' (1961) and ''[[The Bassarids]]'' (1966), and on the libretto of ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'' (based on Shakespeare's play) for [[Nicolas Nabokov]] (1973). Additionally, they wrote the libretto "Delia, or, A Masque of Night" (1953), intended for Stravinsky but never set to music. They were commissioned to write the lyrics for ''[[Man of La Mancha]]'', but Kallman did no work on the project, and the producers decided against using Auden's contributions.

Kallman was the sole author of the libretto of ''[[The Visitors (opera)|The Tuscan Players]]'' for [[Carlos Chávez]] (1953, first performed in 1957 as ''Panfilo and Lauretta'').

He and Auden collaborated on a number of libretto translations, notably ''The Magic Flute'' (1956) and ''Don Giovanni'' (1961). Kallman also translated Verdi's ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]'' (1954), Monteverdi's ''[[L'incoronazione di Poppea|The Coronation of Poppea]]'' (1954) and many other operas.
