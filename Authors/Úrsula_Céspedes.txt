== Works ==
When Céspedes composed her first verses, she received the support of her distant relative [[Carlos Manuel de Céspedes]], who declared Cuban independence in 1868, who also chose her first pseudonym: "La Calandria." During this period, Carlos Manuel was still living in Bayamo. She published her first poems in 1855 in ''Semanario Cubano'' and ''El Redactor'' in [[Santiago de Cuba]], sometimes under the pseudonyms of "La Serrana" and Carlos Enrique Alba. She collaborated on "La Regeneración," published in Bayamo; "La Antorcha," in Manzanillo; "La Alborada" and "Eco de Villa Clara," in [[Santa Clara, Cuba|Santa Clara]]; "El Fomento" and "Hoja Económica," in [[Cienfuegos]]; "Corre de Trinidad" and "La Abeja," in [[Trinidad, Cuba|Trinidad]]; "La Prensa" and "El Kaleidoscopio;"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecured.cu/El_Kaleidoscopio|title=El Kaleidoscopio - EcuRed|website=www.ecured.cu|language=es|access-date=2017-04-07}}</ref> "La Idea" y "Cuba Literaria" in Havana; and "La Moda Elegante" in [[Cádiz]], [[Spain]].

In 1861, she published her book ''Ecos de la Selva'' with a prologue by Carlos Manuel de Céspedes in which he wrote, "Therefore, in spite of the defects they suffer from, her verses grab and seduce one; she paints what she feels; but she does it with such trueness to color, that her feelings are transmitted like magnetic fluid to the heart to those who hear her inspired word."

Her spouse posthumously published ''Cantos Postreros'' in a small private edition.

In 1948, the Dirección de Cultura of the Ministry of Education published a selection of her works.

== Death ==
After the death of Céspedes's brothers and father, the uncontrolled persecution against her family and the loss of all their goods caused her to move to [[Santa Isabel de las Lajas]] where she died on November 2, 1874.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecured.cu/Ursula_C%C3%A9spedes_Orellano_de_Escanaverino|title=Ursula Céspedes Orellano de Escanaverino - EcuRed|website=www.ecured.cu|language=es|type=This article is a translation of sections of this source.|access-date=2017-04-07}}</ref>
