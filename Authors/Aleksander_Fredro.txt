'''Aleksander Fredro''' (20 June 1793 – 15 July 1876) was a [[Polish poet]], [[playwright]] and [[Polish authors|author]] active during [[Romanticism in Poland|Polish Romanticism]] in the [[Partitions of Poland|period of partitions]] by neighboring empires. His works including plays written in the [[octosyllabic verse]] (''[[Zemsta]]'') and in prose (''Damy i Huzary'') as well as fables, belong to the [[Canon (basic principle)|canon]] of [[Polish literature]]. Fredro was harshly criticized by some of his contemporaries for light-hearted humor or even alleged immorality ([[Seweryn Goszczyński]], 1835) which led to years of his literary silence. Many of Fredro's dozens of plays were published and popularized only after his death. His best-known works have been translated into English, French, German, Russian, Czech, Romanian, Hungarian and Slovak.<ref name="Lalewicz">{{cite web | url=http://fredro.kulturalna.com/g-26.html | title=Aleksander Fredro - życie i twórczość (Life and Work) | publisher=Olsztyńskie Towarzystwo Inicjatyw Kulturalnych - Kulturalna Polska | date=May 2004 | access-date=December 9, 2012 | author=Halina Floryńska-Lalewicz | language=pl}}</ref>

==Biography==
Count Aleksander Fredro, of the [[Bończa coat of arms]], was born in the village of Surochów near [[Jarosław]], then a [[Cisleithania|crown territory]] of [[Austria]]. A landowner's son, he was educated at home. He entered the Polish army at age 16 and saw action in the Napoleonic wars, including the Moscow campaign. His memoir ''Topsy Turvy Talk'', which echoes the style of [[Laurence Sterne]]'s ''[[Tristram Shandy]]'', recounts his military experiences during Bonaparte's last campaign. While in France in 1814, he took an active interest in French drama. After leaving the army he settled on his estate and began as a writer.

Fredro made his literary debut in 1817, but he was not interested in the problems of [[Romanticism]]. He wrote social [[comedy|comedies]] about the lifestyle of the [[Polish nobility]] and is known for his skill in characterization and plot, as well as the flexibility of his language. His work also features [[humor]] typical of folk theatre from the Romantic period, and a fast-paced [[farce]] with varying degrees of sophistication.

Two of Fredro's fables, ''The Monkey in the Bath'' (''Małpa w kąpieli'') and ''Paul and Gawel'' (''Paweł i Gaweł''), belong to the most popular [[children's literature|children's stories]] in the country.<ref name="Lalewicz" /> His best-known comedy, ''[[Zemsta]]'' (The Revenge), was [[The Revenge (film)|adapted for the screen]] in Poland by eminent film director [[Andrzej Wajda]] in 2002.
