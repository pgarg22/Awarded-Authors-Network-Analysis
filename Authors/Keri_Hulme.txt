"Our family comes from diverse people: Kai Tahu, [[Kāti Māmoe]] (South Island Maori iwi); [[Orkney|Orkney islanders]]; [[Lancashire]] folk; [[Faroese people|Faroese]] and/or [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] migrants," Hulme told ''Contemporary Women Poets''<ref>"Keri Hulme." Contemporary Women Poets. St. James Press, 1998</ref> Her early education was at North New Brighton Primary School and [[Aranui High School]]. Her father died when she was 11 years old.

Hulme worked as a tobacco picker in [[Motueka]] after high school. She began studying for an honours law degree at the [[University of Canterbury]] in 1967, but left after four terms and returned to tobacco picking, continuing to write throughout this period.<ref name="New Zealand Book Council bio" />

==Career==
By 1972, she decided to begin writing full-time, but, despite family support, was forced to go back to work nine months later. She continued writing, some of her work appearing under the pseudonym Kai Tainui. During this time, she continued working on her novel, ''The Bone People'', ultimately published in February 1984. Before it was accepted by the [[Spiral (publisher)|Spiral Collective]], a feminist literary and arts collective in New Zealand, several publishers rejected the manuscript.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780191823510.001.0001/acref-9780191823510-e-63|title= Hulme, Keri - Oxford Reference|year= 2016|language= en|doi= 10.1093/acref/9780191823510.001.0001|isbn= 9780191823510|access-date= 2018-03-03}}</ref> It won the 1984 New Zealand Book Award for Fiction and the [[Booker Prize]] in 1985.<ref>Keri Hulme."
