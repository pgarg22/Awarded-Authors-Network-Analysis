'''Marianne Craig Moore''' (November 15, 1887 – February 5, 1972) was an  American [[Modernism|modernist]] [[poet]], critic, translator, and editor. Her poetry is noted for formal innovation, precise diction, [[irony]], and wit.

== Early life ==
Moore was born in [[Kirkwood, Missouri]], in the manse of the [[Presbyterian church]] where her maternal grandfather, John Riddle Warner, served as pastor. Her father, John Milton Moore, a mechanical engineer and inventor, suffered a psychotic episode, as a consequence of which her parents separated before she was born; Moore never met him. She and her elder brother, John Warner Moore, were reared by their mother, Mary Warner Moore. The family wrote voluminous letters to one another throughout their lives, often addressing each other by playful nicknames and using a private language.

Like her mother and her elder brother, Moore remained a devoted Presbyterian, strongly influenced by her grandfather, approaching her Christian faith as a lesson in strength vindicated through trials and temptations; her poems often deal with the themes of strength and adversity.<ref name= molesworthintro>Molesworth, Charles.

Moore entered [[Bryn Mawr College]] in 1905. She was graduated four years later with an A.B., having majored in history, economics, and political science.<ref name=leavell>Leavell, Linda. ''Holding On Upside Down: The Life and Work of Marianne Moore''. New York: Farrar Straus and Giroux, 2014. {{ISBN|9780374534943}}</ref> The poet [[H.D.]] was among her classmates during their freshman year. At Bryn Mawr, Moore started writing short stories and poems for ''Tipyn O'Bob'',<ref>https://archive.org/stream/lantern1619stud#page/n251/mode/2up/search/marianne+moore |''Tipyn O'Bob'' at Internet Archive</ref> the campus literary magazine, and decided to become a writer. After graduation, she worked briefly at [[Melvil Dewey]]'s [[Lake Placid Club]], then taught business subjects at the [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]] from 1911 to 1914.

== Poetic career ==
Moore's first professionally published poems appeared in ''[[The Egoist (periodical)|The Egoist]]'' and ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'' in the spring of 1915. [[Harriet Monroe]], the editor of the latter, would describe them in her biography as possessing "an elliptically musical profundity".<ref>Monroe, Harriet. ''A Poets's Life''. New York: Macmillan, 1938.</ref>

In 1916, Moore moved with her mother to [[Chatham Borough, New Jersey|Chatham, New Jersey]], a community with commuting transportation to [[Manhattan]]. Two years later, the two moved to New York City's [[Greenwich Village]], where Moore socialized with many ''avant-garde'' artists, especially those associated with ''Others'' magazine. The innovative poems she was writing at that time received high praise from [[Ezra Pound]], [[William Carlos Williams]], [[H.D.]], [[T. S. Eliot]], and later, [[Wallace Stevens]].

Moore's first book, ''Poems'', was published without her permission in 1921 by the Imagist poet H.D. and H.D.'s partner, the British novelist [[Bryher (novelist)|Bryher]].<ref name=leavell /><ref>Pinsky, Robert.

''The Imagist Poem: Modern Poetry in Miniature''. New York: Dutton, 1963. {{ISBN|9780972814386}}</ref>

Her second book, ''Observations'', won the Dial Award in 1924. She worked part-time as a librarian during these years; then from 1925 to 1929, she edited ''[[The Dial]]'' magazine, a literary and cultural journal. This position in the literary and arts community extended her influence as an arbiter of modernist taste; much later, she encouraged promising young poets, including [[Elizabeth Bishop]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[John Ashbery]], and [[James Merrill]]. When ''The Dial'' ceased publication in 1929, she moved to 260 Cumberland Street<ref>Page, Chester. ''Memoirs of a Charmed Life in New York''. Bloomington, IN: iUniverse, 2007.</ref> in the [[Fort Greene, Brooklyn|Fort Greene]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]], where she remained for thirty-six years. She continued to write while caring for her ailing mother, who died in 1947. For nine years before and after her mother's death, Moore translated the ''Fables of [[LaFontaine]]''.

In 1933, Moore was awarded the Helen Haire Levinson Prize by ''Poetry'' magazine. In 1951, her ''Collected Poems'' won the [[National Book Award for Poetry|National Book Award]],<ref name=nba1952>

In the book's introduction, T. S. Eliot wrote, "My conviction has remained unchanged for the last 14 years that Miss Moore's poems form part of the small body of durable poetry written in our time."<ref name=":0" /> After years of seclusion, she emerged as a celebrity, speaking at college campuses across the country and appearing in photographic essays in ''[[Life Magazine|Life]]'' and ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' magazines. Moore became a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1955.<ref name=":0" /> She was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1962.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter M|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterM.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|access-date=July 29, 2014}}</ref> Moore continued to publish poems in various magazines, including, ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'', ''[[The New Republic]]'', ''[[Partisan Review]]'', and ''[[The New Yorker]]'', as well as publishing various books and collections of her poetry and criticism.

She moved to 35 West Ninth Street in Manhattan in 1965. After she moved back to Greenwich Village, she was widely recognized around town for her tricorn hat and black cape. She liked athletics and was a great admirer of [[Muhammad Ali]], for whose spoken-word album ''I Am the Greatest!'' she wrote the liner notes. She became known as a baseball fan, first of the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] and then of the [[New York Yankees]]. She threw out the ball to open the season at [[Yankee Stadium]] in 1968.

Moore suffered a series of strokes in her last years. She died in 1972, and her ashes were interred with those of her mother at the family's burial plot at the [[Evergreen Cemetery (Adams County, Pennsylvania)|Evergreen Cemetery]] in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.<ref name='Gettysburg'>{{cite web |title=Evergreen Cemetery Part 11 |url=http://www.gettysburgdaily.com/evergreen-cemetery-part-11-with-licensed-battlefield-guide-deb-novotny/ |work=Gettysburg Daily |date=22 November 2010 |access-date=11 October 2016}}</ref><ref name="Leavell2013">{{cite book |author=Linda Leavell |title=Holding On Upside Down: The Life and Work of Marianne Moore|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZetmAgAAQBAJ |date=5 November 2013 |publisher=Faber & Faber |isbn=978-0-571-30183-6}}</ref> By the time of her death, she had received many honorary degrees and virtually every honor available to an American poet.

Moore corresponded with Ezra Pound from 1918, and visited him regularly during his incarceration at [[St. Elizabeths Hospital|St. Elizabeth's]]. She opposed [[Benito Mussolini]] and [[Fascism]] from the start, and objected to Pound's [[antisemitism]]. Moore was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and supported [[Herbert Hoover]] in 1928 and 1932.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Carson |first=Luke |title=Republicanism and Leisure in Marianne Moore's Depression |journal=Modern Language Quarterly |volume=63 |date=September 2002 |issue=3 |pages=315–342 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/modern_language_quarterly/v063/63.3carson.html |access-date=2010-05-16 |doi=10.1215/00267929-63-3-315|s2cid=162274278 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Burt |first=Stephen |title=Paper Trail: The true legacy of Marianne Moore, modernist monument |url=http://fray.slate.com/id/2091081/ |work=Slate |date=November 11, 2003 |access-date=2010-05-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=The Post Modernist Marianne Moore's Letters Add to our Appreciation of a Great Poet's Overflowing Life |last=Hall |first=Donald |author-link=Donald Hall |work=The Boston Globe |date=October 26, 1997 |url=http://www.boston.com/globe/search/stories/books/books97/marianne_moore.htm |access-date=2010-05-16}}</ref> She was a lifelong ally and friend of the American poet Wallace Stevens, as demonstrated in her review of Stevens's first collection, ''[[Harmonium (poetry collection)|Harmonium]]'', and, in particular, by her comment about the influence of [[Henri Rousseau]] on the poem "[[Floral Decorations for Bananas]]". She also corresponded, from 1943 to 1961, with the reclusive collage artist [[Joseph Cornell]], whose methods of collecting and appropriation were much like her own.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/22665359/acts-containment-marianne-moore-joseph-cornell-poetics-enclosure |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418203729/http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/22665359/acts-containment-marianne-moore-joseph-cornell-poetics-enclosure |url-status=dead |archive-date=2015-04-18 |title=Acts of Containment: Marianne Moore, Joseph Cornell, and the Poetics of Enclosure }}</ref>

In 1955, Moore was invited informally by David Wallace, manager of marketing research for [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]'s "E-car" project, and his co-worker Bob Young, to suggest a name for the car. Wallace's rationale was "Who better to understand the nature of words than a poet?" In October 1955, Moore was approached to submit "inspirational names" for the E-car, and on November 7, she offered her list of names, which included such notables as "Resilient Bullet", "Ford Silver Sword", "Mongoose Civique", "Varsity Stroke", "Pastelogram", and "Andante con Moto". On December 8, she submitted her last and most famous name, "Utopian Turtletop". The E-car was christened by Ford as the [[Edsel]].<ref>Her experience was memorably recounted in her epistolic article for ''The New Yorker'' of April 13, 1957, titled "Correspondence with David Wallace". It is anthologized in Mordechai Richler's ''The Best of Modern Humour'', Knopf, 1983, pp 66-73. She notes in her preface, "[These letters] should correct the impression persistent among inquirers, that I succeeded in finding for the new products division ... a name for the new car I had been recruited to name; whereas I did not give the car the name it now has."

Moore never married. Her living room has been preserved in its original layout in the collections of the [[Rosenbach Museum and Library]] in Philadelphia.<ref>{{cite web |title=Marianne Moore Archive |url=http://www.rosenbach.org/learn/collections/marianne-moore-collection |publisher=Rosenbach Museum & Library |access-date=2009-08-22}}</ref> Her entire library, knick-knacks (including a baseball signed by [[Mickey Mantle]]), all of her correspondence, photographs, and poetry drafts are available for public viewing.

Like [[Robert Lowell]], Moore revised many of her early poems in later life. Most of these revised works appeared in the ''Complete Poems'' of 1967. Facsimile editions of the theretofore out-of-print 1924 ''Observations'' became available in 2002. Since that time, there has been no critical consensus about which versions are authoritative. As Moore wrote, as a one-line epigraph to ''Complete Poems'', which offered her well-known work "Poetry" cut down from twenty-nine lines to three: "Omissions are not accidents."<ref>"[https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/marianne-moore Marianne Moore]".

In 2012, she was inducted into the [[New York State Writers Hall of Fame]].

== Poetic style ==
Moore's most famous poem is perhaps the one entitled, appropriately, [[wikisource:Poetry (Moore)|"Poetry"]], in which she hopes for poets who can produce "imaginary gardens with real toads in them". It also expressed her idea that [[meter (poetry)|meter]], or anything else that claims the exclusive title "poetry", is not so important as delight in language and precise, heartfelt expression in any form. Moore's meter was radically separate from the English tradition; writing her syllabic poems after the advent of [[free verse]], she was encouraged thereby to try previously unusual meters.<ref>Hartman, Charles. ''Free Verse: An Essay on Prosody''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1980. {{ISBN|9780810113169}}</ref>

She credited the poetry of [[Edith Sitwell]] as "intensifying her interest in rhythm and encouraging her rhythmic eccentricities".<ref name= molesworthintro /> In response to a biographical sketch in 1935, Moore indicated "a liking for unaccented rhyme, the movement of the poem musically is more important than the conventional look of lines upon the page, and the stanza as the unit of composition rather than the line".<ref name=lettergray /> Later in her ''Selected Poems'' of 1969, she also commented in regard to her poetic form, that "in anything I have written, there have been lines in which the chief interest is borrowed, and I have not yet been able to outgrow this hybrid method of composition".<ref>Moore, Marianne. Note to ''Selected Poems''. London: Faber & Faber, 1969. {{ISBN|978-0-571-08856-0}}</ref>

Moore often composed her poetry in [[Syllabic verse|syllabics]]; she used stanzas with a predetermined number of syllables as her "unit of sense", with indentation underlining the parallels, the shape of the stanza indicating the syllabic disposition, and her reading voice conveying the syntactical line.<ref>Schmidt, Michael. ''Lives of the Poets''. London: Orion Press, 1998. {{ISBN|9780753807453}}</ref> These syllabic lines from "Poetry" illustrate her position: poetry is a matter of skill and honesty in any form whatsoever, while anything written poorly, although in perfect form, cannot be poetry:

{{poemquote|
:::nor is it valid
:::::to discriminate against "business documents and
school-books": all these phenomena are important. One must make a distinction
::::however: when dragged into prominence by half poets, the result is not poetry}}

== Involvement in the American suffrage movement ==
Moore was involved in the American suffrage movement starting in her university years at Bryn Mawr, from 1905 to 1909.<ref name="Leavell2013" /> During this time in the American suffrage movement, [[Anna Howard Shaw]] had just taken over as president of the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]]; [[Harriot Stanton Blatch]] formed the Equality League of Self Supporting Women, which started the practice of suffrage parades; and soon (in 1910) women in the state of Washington were granted the right to vote.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of the American Suffragist Movement|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofamerica0000weat|url-access=registration|last=Weatherford|first=Doris|publisher=ABC-Clio|year=1998|isbn=9781576070659}}</ref>

Moore's combined major in history, politics, and economics and the suffrage involvement of professors and other students at Bryn Mawr exposed her to the women's suffrage movement, especially because it was a "unique period in the history of women’s college, as the values of progressivism, women’s education, and the ideology of separate spheres came together in a kind of perfect storm that created a climate for cultural change".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Degrees of Freedom American Women Poets and the Women's College|last=Hicok|first=Bethany|publisher=Rosemont Publishing & Publishing Corporation|year=2008|isbn=978-0-8387-5693-5|location=NJ}}</ref> Moore was involved in a "suffrage society",<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=Making Noise, Making News, Suffrage Print Culture and U.S. Modernism|last=Chapman|first=Mary|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-19-998829-7}}</ref> a chapter of the National College Equal Suffrage League, and she was present at most of their events. Notably, Moore wrote in her personal letters to her family that she attended lectures at Bryn Mawr by the well-known feminist [[Jane Addams]] and the British suffragette [[Anne Cobden-Sanderson]]. Of the American suffragist Anna Howard Shaw, she wrote: "Miss Shaw spoke last night on the Modern Democratic ideal. I couldn't say how she delighted me. No decent, half-kind, creature could possibly think of fighting suffrage if he or it had heard her arguments."<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|title=The Selected Letters of Marianne Moore|last=Moore|first=Marianne|publisher=Random House|year=1997|isbn=0-679-43909-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/selectedletterso00moor/page/63 63-66]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/selectedletterso00moor/page/63}}</ref>

Moore went on a trip to New York City in 1909 with another Bryn Mawr student, where she heard a lecture by the Colorado suffragist Judge Ben Lindsey, went to a suffrage mass meeting, and saw [[J. M. Barrie]]'s classic suffragist-themed play ''What Every Woman Knows''.<ref name=":1" /> There is speculation that Moore also participated in the women's suffrage parade of 1913 in Washington, D.C., one day before [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s presidential inauguration.<ref name=":1" /> Although in her personal letters<ref name=":2" /> she told her brother, Warner, that she did not participate in the parade after he cautioned her about the possible dangers she would face from the opponents of the parade, "[h]er scrapbook includes programs and newspaper clippings about the march", and she later told the poet [[Elizabeth Bishop]] that she "paraded with the suffragettes, led by [[Inez Milholland]] on her white horse".<ref name="Leavell2013" />

Moore was never as public about her involvement in the suffrage movement after that parade in 1913, because afterward she began participating anonymously, mostly through writing, using a pseudonym.<ref name=":1" /> During her stay in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, she admitted years later, she "wrote suffrage pieces for the Carlisle newspaper",<ref>{{Cite book|title=Marianne Moore Questions of Authority|last=Miller|first=Cristanne|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1995|isbn=0-674-54862-0|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/mariannemooreque0000mill}}</ref> which at the time appeared to be authored anonymously. Dr. Mary Chapman (University of British Columbia) argues that Moore was the writer of suffragist writings of the time in Carlisle news publications and that could be analyzed by examining her specific writing style alongside suffragist prose and poetry that were published in the ''Carlisle Evening Herald'' in 1915: "Many of the prosuffrage articles that appeared in the ''Herald'' exhibit Moore's characteristic reliance on quotation."<ref name=":1" /> Additionally, a letter appealing for the women's suffrage movement in the ''Carlisle Evening Sentinel'' is signed "Miss M.M.", which scholars believe could stand for Marianne Moore because "the absence of any other documented unmarried female suffragists in the Carlisle area with the initials M.M. make it likely that the ''Sentinel'' reader who coyly constructs a letter to the editor almost entirely from quotation is Marianne Moore".<ref name=":1" /> Moore's poem "Silence" (1924) also resembles the writing style that was seen in the ''Sentinel'' letter.<ref name=":1" /> Moore established herself on the surface as a modernist poet, and the common practice within the modernist circle of poets was to not engage with the politics of the time; but her writings displayed a "sophisticated political subtext".<ref name=":1" />
