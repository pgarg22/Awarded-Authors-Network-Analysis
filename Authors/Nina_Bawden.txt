'''Nina Bawden''' [[CBE]], [[FRSL]], [[Justice of the Peace|JP]] (19 January 1925 &ndash; 22 August 2012) was an [[English people|English]] novelist and [[children's writer]]. She was shortlisted for the [[Booker Prize]] in 1987 and the [[Lost Man Booker Prize]] in 2010. She is one of very few who have both served as a Booker judge and made a Booker shortlist as an author.<ref name=roundup/> She was a recipient of the [[Golden PEN Award]].

==Biography==
Bawden was born in 1925<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/carrieswar/bawden.html |year=2014 |access-date=28 January 2015 |title=Carrie's War: Author Nina Bawden |publisher=Masterpiece Theatre (PBS)}}</ref> and lived in [[Ilford]], [[Essex]], in "a rather nasty housing estate that [her] mother despised".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/nov/22/featuresreviews.guardianreview5 |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=22 November 2003 |title=Nina's wars |access-date=12 April 2010 |author=Rustin, Susanna}}</ref> Her mother was a teacher and her father a member of the [[Royal Marines]]. She was [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|evacuated during World War II]] to [[Aberdare]], Wales, at the age of fourteen. She spent school holidays at a farm in [[Shropshire]] with her mother and brothers.

She attended [[Valentines High School|Ilford County High School for Girls]]; [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville College]] (B.A. 1946, M.A. 1951), [[Oxford University|Oxford]], where she gained a degree in [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]].

From 1946 to 1954 Bawden was married to Harry Bawden. They had two sons, Nicholas (who took his own life in 1981)<ref name=bbc/> and Robert. In 1954 she married [[Austen Kark]], a reporter who eventually became managing director of the BBC World Service. They had a daughter, Perdita, who died in March 2012.<ref>[http://announcements.thetimes.co.uk/obituaries/timesonline-uk/obituary.aspx?pid=156486848 Perdita Kark obituary], ''[[The Times]]'', 15 March 2012</ref> She also had two stepdaughters: Cathy, who lives in [[New Zealand]], and Teresa, who lives in London.
In 2002 Bawden was badly injured in the [[Potters Bar rail crash]], in which her husband Austen Kark was killed. Her testimony about the crash, and her exploration of the management and maintenance mistakes that caused it, became a major part of [[David Hare (playwright)|David Hare]]'s play ''[[The Permanent Way]]'', in which she appeared as a character.

Bawden died at her home in north London on 22 August 2012.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=telegraph/>

==Literary career==
Some of Bawden's 55 books have been dramatised by [[BBC]] Children's television. Many have been published in translation.<ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n79-022268 "Bawden, Nina"]. WorldCat. Retrieved 6 August 2012.</ref>

Her novels include ''[[On the Run (novel)|On the Run]]'' (1964), ''[[The Witch's Daughter]]'' (1966), ''[[The Birds on the Trees]]'' (1970), ''[[Carrie's War]]'' (1973), and ''The Peppermint Pig'' (1975). For the latter she won the 1976 [[Guardian Children's Fiction Prize]], a once-in-a-lifetime book award judged by a panel of British children's writers.<ref name=relaunch/> ''Carrie's War'' won the 1993 [[Phoenix Award]] from the [[Children's Literature Association]] as the best English-language children's book that did not win a major contemporary award when it was originally published twenty years earlier. It is named for the [[Phoenix (mythology)|mythical bird phoenix]], which is reborn from its ashes, to suggest the book's rise from obscurity.<ref name=phoenix/> (Bawden and ''Carrie's War'' had been a commended runner up for the [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] from the [[CILIP|Library Association]], recognising the year's best children's book by a [[British subject]].)<ref name=ccsu/>{{efn |name=HC}}

In 2010, Bawden and ''The Birds on the Trees'' made the shortlist for the [[Lost Man Booker Prize]]. Forty years earlier, the [[Booker-McConnell Prize]] for the year's best British novel had skipped 1970 publications. Bawden and [[Shirley Hazzard]] were the only living nominees out of the six shortlisted; the award went to [[J. G. Farrell]] for ''[[Troubles (novel)|Troubles]]''. In 2004, she was awarded the [[Golden PEN Award]] by [[English PEN]] for "a Lifetime's Distinguished Service to Literature".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.englishpen.org/prizes/golden-pen-award-for-a-lifetimes-distinguished-service-to-literature |title=Golden Pen Award, official website |publisher=[[English PEN]] |access-date=3 December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/carries-war-author-nina-bawden-dies-8073281.html |title=Carrie's War author Nina Bawden died on 22 August 2012.}}</ref>
