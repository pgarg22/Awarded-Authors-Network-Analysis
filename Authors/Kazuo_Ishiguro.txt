'''Sir Kazuo Ishiguro''' {{postnom|country=GBR|OBE|FRSA|FRSL}} ({{IPAc-en|k|æ|ˈ|z|uː|oʊ|_|ˌ|ɪ|ʃ|ɪ|ˈ|ɡ|ʊər|oʊ|,_|ˈ|k|æ|z|u|oʊ|_|-}}; born 8 November 1954) is a British novelist, screenwriter, musician, and short-story writer. He was born in [[Nagasaki]], [[Japan]] and moved to Britain in 1960 with his parents when he was five.

A graduate of the [[University of East Anglia]], Ishiguro is one of the most celebrated contemporary fiction authors in English. His first two novels, ''[[A Pale View of Hills]]'' and ''[[An Artist of the Floating World]]'', were noted for their explorations of Japanese identity and [[elegiac]] tone. Subsequently, he explored other genres, including [[science fiction]] and [[historical fiction]]. He has received four [[Man Booker Prize]] nominations and won the award in 1989 for his novel ''[[The Remains of the Day]]'', which was adapted into a [[The Remains of the Day (film)|film of the same name]] in 1993. Fellow author [[Salman Rushdie]] has praised the novel as Ishiguro's masterpiece, in which he "turned away from the Japanese settings of his first two novels and revealed that his sensibility was not rooted in any one place, but capable of travel and metamorphosis".<ref>{{Cite web|date=2012-08-17|title=Salman Rushdie: rereading The Remains of the Day by Kazuo Ishiguro|url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/17/rereading-remains-day-salman-rushdie|access-date=2021-06-23|website=the Guardian|language=en}}</ref> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' named Ishiguro's science fiction novel ''[[Never Let Me Go (novel)|Never Let Me Go]]'' the best novel of 2005 and one of the 100 best English-language novels published between 1923 and 2005. 

In 2017, the [[Swedish Academy]] awarded Ishiguro the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], describing him in its citation as a writer "who, in novels of great emotional force, has uncovered the abyss beneath our illusory sense of connection with the world".<ref name="Nobel">{{Cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2017/press.html |title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 2017 – Press Release |publisher=Nobel Prize |access-date=5 October 2017}}</ref>

==Early life==
Ishiguro was born in Nagasaki, Japan, on 8 November 1954, the son of [[Shizuo Ishiguro]], a [[physical oceanography|physical oceanographer]], and his wife, Shizuko.<ref name="bio">{{cite book |title=Kazuo Ishiguro |first=Barry |last=Lewis |publisher=Manchester University Press |year=2000}}</ref> At the age of five,<ref name=":0">{{cite journal|last=Oe|first=Kenzaburo|year=1991|title=The Novelist in Today's World: A Conversation|journal=[[boundary 2]]|volume=18|issue=3|page=110}}</ref> Ishiguro and his family left Japan and moved to [[Guildford]], [[Surrey]], as his father was invited for research at the National Institute of Oceanography (now the [[National Oceanography Centre, Southampton|National Oceanography Centre]]).<ref name="bio" /><ref name="BritCouncil">{{Cite web |title=Kazuo Ishiguro |url=http://literature.britishcouncil.org/kazuo-ishiguro |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302152935/http://literature.britishcouncil.org/kazuo-ishiguro |archive-date=2 March 2012 |access-date=15 February 2012 |website=British Council}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://beta.sciencemuseum.org.uk/stories/2016/11/4/modelling-the-oceans|title=Modelling the oceans|website=Science Museum Group|access-date=7 October 2017}}</ref> He did not return to visit Japan until 1989, nearly 30 years later, when he was a participant in the [[Japan Foundation]] Short-Term Visitors' Program.

In an interview with [[Kenzaburō Ōe]], Ishiguro stated that the Japanese settings of his first two novels were imaginary: "I grew up with a very strong image in my head of this other country, a very important other country to which I had a strong emotional tie … In England I was all the time building up this picture in my head, an imaginary Japan."<ref name=":0" />

Ishiguro, who has been described as a [[British Asian]] author,<ref>{{cite book|author=Tamara S.

He attended Stoughton Primary School and then [[List of schools in Surrey|Woking County Grammar School]] in [[Surrey]].<ref name="bio" /> Ishiguro sang solos as a [[choirboy]] at his church choir and school choir, and had a local fame due to the angelic qualities of his voice.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Gross |first=Terry |author-link=Terry Gross |date=17 March 2021 |title=Kazuo Ishiguro Draws On His Songwriting Past To Write Novels About The Future |url=https://www.npr.org/transcripts/978138547 |access-date=18 March 2021 |website=[[Fresh Air]] |publisher=[[NPR]]}}</ref> He also enjoyed music as a teenager, listening to songs by the likes of [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Joni Mitchell]] and, particularly, [[Bob Dylan]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Harvey |first=Giles |date=23 February 2021 |title=Kazuo Ishiguro Sees What the Future Is Doing to Us |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/23/magazine/kazuo-ishiguro-klara.html |access-date=18 March 2021}}</ref> Ishiguro began learning guitar and writing songs, and initially aimed to become a professional songwriter.<ref name="achievement" /><ref name="Kellaway">{{Cite web|date=2015-03-15|title=Kazuo Ishiguro: I used to see myself as a musician.

I'm much less glamorous. I'm one of these people with corduroy jackets with elbow patches. It was a real comedown."<ref name="Kellaway" />

In 1974, he began studies at the [[University of Kent|University of Kent at Canterbury]], graduating in 1978 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (honours) in [[English studies|English]] and [[philosophy]].<ref name="bio" /> After spending a year writing fiction, he resumed his studies at the [[University of East Anglia]] where he studied with [[Malcolm Bradbury]] and [[Angela Carter]] on UEA's distinguished [[UEA Creative Writing Course|Creative Writing course]], gaining a [[Master of Arts]] in 1980.<ref name="bio" /><ref name="BritCouncil" /> His thesis became his first novel, ''A Pale View of Hills'', published in 1982.<ref name="bbc2017">{{cite news |title=Kazuo Ishiguro: Nobel Literature Prize is 'a magnificent honour' |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-41513246 |access-date=5 October 2017 |work=BBC News |date=5 October 2017}}</ref>

==Literary career==
Ishiguro set his first two novels in Japan; however, in several interviews, he said that he has little familiarity with Japanese writing and that his works bear little resemblance to [[Japanese literature|Japanese fiction]].<ref name=":1" /> In an interview in 1989, when discussing his Japanese heritage and its influence on his upbringing, he stated, "I'm not entirely like English people because I've been brought up by Japanese parents in a Japanese-speaking home. My parents (...) felt responsible for keeping me in touch with [[Japanese values]]. I do have a distinct background. I think differently, my perspectives are slightly different."<ref name="bomb" /> In a 1990 interview, Ishiguro said, "If I wrote under a pseudonym and got somebody else to pose for my jacket photographs, I'm sure nobody would think of saying, 'This guy reminds me of that Japanese writer.'"<ref name=":1">{{cite book|title=Face to Face: Interviews with Contemporary Novelists|last1=Vorda|first1=Allan|last2=Herzinger|first2=Kim|publisher=Rice University Press|year=1994|isbn=0-8926-3323-9|page=25|chapter=Stuck on the Margins: An Interview with Kazuo Ishiguro}}</ref> Although some Japanese writers have had a distant influence on his writing—[[Jun'ichirō Tanizaki]] is the one he most frequently cites—Ishiguro has said that Japanese films, especially those of [[Yasujirō Ozu]] and [[Mikio Naruse]], have been a more significant influence.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mason|first=Gregory|year=1989|title=An Interview with Kazuo Ishiguro|journal=[[Contemporary Literature (journal)|Contemporary Literature]]|volume=30|issue=3|page=336|doi=10.2307/1208408|jstor=1208408}}</ref>

[[File:Cast of Never Let Me Go @ BFI Film Festival.jpg|thumb|Ishiguro (front) with the cast of the [[Never Let Me Go (2010 film)|''Never Let Me Go'']] film in 2010]]

Some of Ishiguro's novels are set in the past. ''[[Never Let Me Go (novel)|Never Let Me Go]]'' has [[science fiction]] qualities and a [[futuristic]] tone; however, it is set in the 1980s and 1990s, and takes place in a [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel world]] very similar to ours. His fourth novel, ''[[The Unconsoled]]'', takes place in an unnamed [[Central Europe]]an city. ''[[The Remains of the Day]]'' is set in the large [[English country house|country house]] of an [[Peerage of England|English lord]] in the period surrounding [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite news |title=The Remains of the Day by Kazuo Ishiguro – a subtle masterpiece of quiet desperation |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/jan/07/the-remains-of-the-day-by-kazuo-ishiguro-book-to-share |first=Peter |last=Beech |date=7 January 2016 |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=6 October 2017}}</ref>

''[[An Artist of the Floating World]]'' is set in an unnamed Japanese city during the [[Occupation of Japan]] following [[Surrender of Japan|the nation's surrender]] in 1945. The narrator is forced to come to terms with his part in [[Japan during World War II|World War II]]. He finds himself blamed by the [[Post-occupation Japan|new generation]] who accuse him of being part of [[Empire of Japan|Japan's]] misguided foreign policy, and is forced to confront the ideals of the [[modern world|modern times]] as represented by his grandson. Ishiguro said of his choice of time period, "I tend to be attracted to pre-war and postwar settings because I'm interested in this business of values and ideals being tested, and people having to face up to the notion that their ideals weren't quite what they thought they were before the test came."<ref name="bomb">{{Cite magazine |last=Swift |first=Graham |url=http://bombsite.com/issues/29/articles/1269 |title=Kazuo Ishiguro |magazine=[[Bomb (magazine)|BOMB]] |date=Fall 1989 |access-date=12 January 2012}}</ref>

With the exception of ''[[The Buried Giant]]'', Ishiguro's novels are written in the [[first-person narrative]] style.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books-and-media/kazuo-ishiguros-legendary-novel-the-remains-of-the-day-resurges/article20077637/?ref=https://www.theglobeandmail.com& |title=Salman Rushdie on Kazuo Ishiguro: His legendary novel The Remains of the Day resurges |last=Rushdie |first=Salman |date=15 August 2014 |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |access-date=6 October 2017 |author-link=Salman Rushdie}}</ref>

Ishiguro's novels often end without [[Dramatic structure|resolution]]. The issues his characters confront are buried in the past and remain unresolved. Thus Ishiguro ends many of his novels on a note of melancholic resignation. His characters accept their past and who they have become, typically discovering that this realisation brings comfort and an ending to mental anguish. This can be seen as a literary reflection on the [[Japanese aesthetics|Japanese idea]] of ''[[mono no aware]]''.{{Original research inline|date=May 2018}} Ishiguro counts [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Dostoyevsky]] and [[Marcel Proust|Proust]] among his influences. His works have also been compared to [[Salman Rushdie]], [[Jane Austen]], and [[Henry James]], though Ishiguro himself rejects these comparisons.<ref name=GuardianBio>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jun/13/kazuo.ishiguro |title=Kazuo Ishiguro |date=22 July 2008 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=27 October 2015}}</ref>

In 2017, Ishiguro was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], because "in novels of great emotional force, [he] has uncovered the abyss beneath our illusory sense of connection with the world".<ref name="Nobel" /> In response to receiving the award, Ishiguro stated:<blockquote>It's a magnificent honour, mainly because it means that I'm in the footsteps of the greatest authors that have lived, so that's a terrific commendation. The world is in a very uncertain moment and I would hope all the Nobel Prizes would be a force for something positive in the world as it is at the moment. I'll be deeply moved if I could in some way be part of some sort of climate this year in contributing to some sort of positive atmosphere at a very uncertain time.<ref name="bbc2017" /></blockquote>

Ishiguro was appointed [[Knight Bachelor]] for services to literature in the [[2018 Birthday Honours]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Kazuo Ishiguro: Knighthood part of 'big love affair with Britain' |date=7 February 2019 |work=The Irish Times |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/kazuo-ishiguro-knighthood-part-of-big-love-affair-with-britain-1.3785813}}</ref>

Ishiguro's eighth novel, ''[[Klara and the Sun]]'', was published by [[Faber and Faber]] on 2 March 2021. Rumaan Alam of ''[[The New Republic]]'' wrote it is "more simple than it seems, less novel than parable."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Alam |first1=Rumaan |title=Kazuo Ishiguro's Deceptively Simple Story of AI |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/161899/kazuo-ishiguro-klara-sun-review-deceptively-simple-story-ai |access-date=13 April 2021 |publisher=New Republic |date=12 April 2021}}</ref> It was longlisted for the 2021 [[Booker Prize]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thebookerprizes.com/fiction/2021|title=The 2021 Booker Prize longlist is:|publisher=The Booker Prizes|date=27 July 2021}}</ref> In the novel he discusses subjects such as the dangers of technological advancement, the future of our world, and the meaning of being human that he also broached in his earlier books.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Novak|first=Kris|year=2021| URL=https://www.raintaxi.com/klara-and-the-sun/ |title=KLARA AND THE SUN|journal=[[Rain Taxi]]|OCLC=939786025 |ISSN=1943-4383}}</ref>

In 2021, a British remake of the Japanese film ''[[Ikiru]]'' titled ''[[Living (upcoming film)|Living]]'' was made, with an adapted screenplay written by Ishiguro, directed by [[Oliver Hermanus]], and starring [[Bill Nighy]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Yossman|first=K.

==Musical work==
Ishiguro has co-written several songs for the jazz singer [[Stacey Kent]] with saxophonist [[Jim Tomlinson]], Kent's husband. Ishiguro contributed lyrics to Kent's 2007 Grammy-nominated album ''[[Breakfast on the Morning Tram]]'',<ref name="AllmusicBreakfast">{{AllMusic|class=album|id=http://www.allmusic.com/album/breakfast-on-the-morning-tram-mw0000781224 |label=Breakfast on the Morning Tram}}</ref> including its title track, her 2011 album, ''Dreamer in Concert'', her 2013 album ''[[The Changing Lights]]'',<ref name="AllmusicLights">{{AllMusic|class=album|id=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-changing-lights-mw0002566855 |label=The Changing Lights}}</ref> and her 2017 album, ''I Know I Dream''. Ishiguro also wrote the liner notes to Kent's 2003 album, ''In Love Again''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Why 'Breakfast on the Morning Tram'? |url=http://www.staceykent.com/press.html |publisher=StaceyKent.com |access-date=15 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217165133/http://www.staceykent.com/press.html |archive-date=17 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Ishiguro first met Kent after he chose her recording of "[[They Can't Take That Away from Me]]" as one of his ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'' in 2002 and Kent subsequently asked him to write for her.

Ishiguro has said of his lyric writing that "with an intimate, confiding, first-person song, the meaning must not be self-sufficient on the page. It has to be oblique, sometimes you have to read between the lines" and that this realisation has had an "enormous influence" on his fiction writing.<ref name='GuardMar15'>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/15/kazuo-ishiguro-i-used-to-see-myself-as-a-musician |title=Kazuo Ishiguro: I used to see myself as a musician.

Except for ''A Pale View of Hills'' and ''The Buried Giant'', all of Ishiguro's novels and his short story collection have been shortlisted for major awards.<ref name=BritCouncil/> Most significantly, ''[[An Artist of the Floating World]]'', ''[[When We Were Orphans]]'', and ''[[Never Let Me Go (novel)|Never Let Me Go]]'' were all short-listed for the Booker Prize (as was ''The Remains of the Day'', which won it). A leaked account of a judging committee's meeting revealed that the committee found itself deciding between ''[[Never Let Me Go (novel)|Never Let Me Go]]'' and John Banville's ''[[The Sea (novel)|The Sea]]'' before awarding the prize to the latter.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article577423.ece |newspaper=The Times |title=At last, the best Booker book won |first=Rick |last=Gekoski |author-link=Rick Gekoski |date=12 October 2005 |access-date=28 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/books/its-the-critics-at-sea/2005/10/15/1128796742760.html?page=3 |newspaper=[[The Age]] |title=It's the critics at Sea |first=Rick |last=Gekoski |date=16 October 2005 |access-date=28 June 2010 |quote=In the end, it came down to a debate between ''The Sea'' and ''Never Let Me Go''.}}</ref>
