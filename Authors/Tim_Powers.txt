'''Timothy Thomas Powers''' (born February 29, 1952)<ref>"WonderCon Special Guests," ''Comic-Con Magazine'' (Winter 2010), p. 20.</ref> is an American [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy fiction|fantasy]] author. Powers has won the [[World Fantasy Award]] twice for his critically acclaimed novels ''[[Last Call (novel)|Last Call]]'' and ''[[Declare]]''.  His 1987 novel ''[[On Stranger Tides]]'' served as inspiration for the ''[[Monkey Island (series)|Monkey Island]]'' franchise of video games and was optioned for adaptation into the [[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides|fourth ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' film]].

Most of Powers' novels are "[[secret history|secret histories]]". He uses actual, documented historical events featuring famous people, but shows another view of them in which occult or supernatural factors heavily influence the motivations and actions of the characters.

Typically, Powers strictly adheres to established historical facts. He reads extensively on a given subject, and the plot develops as he notes inconsistencies, gaps and curious data; regarding his 2001 novel ''Declare'', he stated, "I made it an ironclad rule that I could not change or disregard any of the recorded facts, nor rearrange any days of the calendar – and then I tried to figure out what momentous but unrecorded fact could explain them all."<ref>[http://www.powells.com/authors/powers.html Powells.com Interviews – Tim Powers<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010627162405/http://www.powells.com/authors/powers.html |date=2001-06-27 }}</ref>

Another friend Powers first met during this period was noted science fiction writer [[Philip K. Dick]];<ref>{{Cite web|date=2011-06-03|title=Tim Powers: 'I don't have to make anything up'|url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/03/tim-powers-i-dont-have-to-make-anything-up|access-date=2021-09-14|website=the Guardian|language=en}}</ref> the character named "David" in Dick's novel ''[[VALIS]]'' is based on Powers. When ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'' was retitled ''[[Blade Runner]]'' to tie-in with the movie based on the novel, Dick dedicated it to Tim and Serena Powers.

Powers' first major novel was ''[[The Drawing of the Dark]]'' (1979),<ref name="ignatiusinsight.com"/> but the novel that earned him wide praise was  ''[[The Anubis Gates]]'', which won the [[Philip K. Dick Award]], and has since been published in many other languages.

Powers also teaches part-time in his role as Writer in Residence for the [[Orange County High School of the Arts]] and California School of the Arts in San Gabriel Valley in the [[Creative Writing]] Conservatory, as well as [[Chapman University]], where Blaylock taught. He also taught part-time at the [[University of Redlands]].

Powers and his wife, Serena Batsford Powers, currently live in [[Muscoy, California]]. He has frequently served as a mentor author as part of the [[Clarion Writers Workshop|Clarion science fiction/fantasy writer's workshop]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=The SF Site: An Interview With Tim Powers|url=https://www.sfsite.com/09a/9tp.htm|access-date=2021-09-14|website=www.sfsite.com}}</ref>
