==Biography==
Cameron was born in the US, in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], in 1962 and grew up in [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], NY, and [[Iowa City]], Iowa, as well as [[Rockport, Massachusetts]]. He attended high school at McQuaid Jesuit High School in Rochester, NY, and got an honors BA in Medieval History at the [[University of Rochester]]. After University, Cameron joined the [[United States Navy]] as an ensign, serving in [[VS-31]] as an air intelligence officer and gaining his air observer wings before going to spend the rest of his military career as a [[Human intelligence (intelligence gathering)|human intelligence]] officer, first with [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service|NCIS]] and later with the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|DHS]] in Washington, DC. Cameron left the US military in 2000 as a lieutenant commander.

While still serving in the Navy, Cameron proposed his first novel with his father (Kenneth Cameron, American novelist and playwright) to HarperCollins UK, which was published in 1998 as ''Night Trap'' in the UK and ''Rules of Engagement'' in the United States. In 2002, Cameron wrote his first solo novel, ''Washington and Caesar'', published by HarperCollins in the UK and Random House in the US. Also in 2002, Cameron moved to Canada and married his wife, Sarah. They have one child, Beatrice.

==Fictional works==
===''Alan Craik'' series===
The ''Alan Craik'' series of espionage thrillers was conceived on a camping trip in the [[Adirondacks]] in 1994-5 and the events of the first book are very loosely based on the activities of [[John Anthony Walker]] and his son, father and son spies working for the [[Soviet Union]] against the [[United States Navy]]. Christian Cameron envisioned the books as a modern-day [[Horatio Hornblower|Hornblower]] series, depicting the life of a modern naval officer from his earliest career until his retirement. Over the course of eight novels, Alan Craik changes from a patriotic, enthusiastic and driven young man to a cynical and ambitious middle-aged man who resigns as a Captain to protest the use of intelligence to justify bad political decisions.

===''Tyrant'' series===
The ''Tyrant'' series was born in the classrooms of the Classics Department of the University of Toronto, where Cameron decided to write a series of historical novels in 2003.  From 2003 to the present, Cameron has written six Tyrant novels: ''Tyrant'' (2008),<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Foex | first1 = B. A | title = Back to the future: emergency departments and ancient Greek warfare | doi = 10.1136/bmj.a2761 | journal = BMJ | volume = 337 | issue = dec15 1 | pages = a2761 | year = 2008 | pmid = 19074940 | s2cid = 20028109 }}</ref> ''Storm of Arrows'' (2009), ''Funeral Games'' (2010), ''King of the Bosporus'' (2011), ''Destroyer of Cities'' (2013) and ''Force of Kings'' (2014).  The Tyrant series is set in the time of [[Alexander the Great]] and concerns the history of the [[Euxine]] area and the inter-relations between the [[Greeks]] and [[Scythians]].  Cameron also produced a single volume fictional biography of Alexander entitled ''God of War'' which ties into the Tyrant series. ''God of War'' was published in 2012.

===''Long War'' series===
The ''Long War'' series is Cameron's second historical series, also published by Orion in the UK. Cameron's series covers the [[Persian Wars]] from the first-person point of view of a historical figure, [[Arimnestos]] of [[Plataea]]. The first book, ''Killer of Men'' (published in 2010), is named after Achilles, the man-killer of the [[Iliad]], and covers in first person the early life of Arimnestos and his participation in the [[Ionian Revolt]]. The next installment of the series is ''Marathon'' (published 2011), which culminates in the titular [[Battle of Marathon|battle]]. ''Poseidon's Spear'' (2013) covers the five years after Marathon and is a more personal tale of adventure, exploration and revenge across the western Mediterranean and [[Atlantic Europe]]. ''The Great King'' (2014) has Arimnestos partake in [[Sparta|Sparta's]] diplomatic mission to Persia and ends with the [[Battle of Artemisium]]. ''Salamis'' (2015) covers the titular [[Battle of Salamis|battle]] and ''The Rage of Ares'' (2016) ends the series with the battles of [[Battle of Plataea|Plataea]] and [[Battle of Mycale|Mycale]]. In addition to the battles, the series also features aspects of life in ancient Greece, such as [[Metalsmith|smithery]], [[Agriculture in ancient Greece|farming]] and [[Ancient maritime history|sailing]], and historical figures such as [[Heraclitus]], [[Aristides]], [[Gorgo, Queen of Sparta|Gorgo]] and [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]].

===''Chivalry'' series===

The ''Chivalry'' series is Cameron's third historical series, also published by Orion (May 2013).  Based loosely around the exploits of Sir William Gold, one of [[Sir John Hawkwood]]'s lieutenant's in Italy, this series begins with Gold's life as a goldsmith's apprentice in London just after the great plague of 1347 and will continue through the [[Battle of Poitiers]] and the [[Savoyard Crusade]], as well as the [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381, right through to the [[Battle of Agincourt]] in 1415, covering the history of the period—military, chivalric, and literary—in England, France, Italy, and Greece and roughly in parallel with the career of Chaucer's knight. [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] is a major character, along with [[John Hawkwood]] and [[Jean Le Maingre]].

===''Traitor Son Cycle''===
Originally planned as a trilogy, and extended to a five book<ref name="hippeis-2015-04-17">{{cite web|author=Shelley Power|title=Traitor Son Cycle book 3 question|url=http://www.hippeis.com/forum/index.php?topic=1316.msg16289#msg16289|publisher=Hippeis (Christian Cameron)}}{{Dead link|date=July 2020|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> fantasy series with an alternative medieval setting. The major story arc takes the Red Knight from the relative obscurity of command of a little-known mercenary company to fame, international renown, worldly power, and confrontation with the real powers of his world and perhaps with his own belief system.

===''Masters and Mages''===
A magical fantasy alternate medieval setting fictional universe, written after the conclusion of the Traitor Son pentalogy, planned as a trilogy.<ref name=ChristianCameronAuthor-2018-08-13>{{cite web |url= https://christiancameronauthor.com/index.php/2018/08/13/no-writer-is-an-island/ |title= No Writer is an Island |date= 13 August 2018 |author= Christian Cameron |publisher= The Worlds of Christian/Miles Cameron }}</ref>

==Reenactment==
[[File:Marathon's Best.jpg|thumb|right|400px|alt=text|Hoplite reenactors at Marathon, September, 2011]]

Cameron is a passionate [[Historical reenactment|reenactor]], and uses the experiences of reenacting, including knowledge of the material culture and the skill sets required to recreate any portion of life in the past as essential tools in writing his novels.<ref>Christian Cameron: Representing the past, {{cite web|url=http://arts.nationalpost.com/2012/03/01/christian-cameron-representing-the-past/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-09-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302073542/http://arts.nationalpost.com/2012/03/01/christian-cameron-representing-the-past/ |archive-date=2012-03-02 }}</ref>  Cameron helps organize and direct military and non-military reenactments in the United States, Canada, and [[Europe]]. 

In 2011, Cameron, with the help of [[Greeks|Greek]] reenactor Giannis Kadaglou, put on the 2500th anniversary of the [[Battle of Marathon]] in [[Marathon, Greece|Marathon]], [[Greece]]<ref>History brought to life as Battle of Marathon re-enacted, https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gXARXuUc4gFuTJbWh-RY5zRXX50Q</ref> with over 100 reenactors from all over the world and thousands of Greek spectators. In addition to recreating the life of an early 5th-century [[Plataea]]n [[Hoplite]], Cameron also runs a group dedicated to the role of rangers and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in the [[American Revolution]], and participates in [[tournament]]s as a [[knight]] of the late 14th century. One such tournament is the Deed of Alms, an annual [[Historical European Martial Arts|HEMA]] (Historical European Martial Arts) charity tournament hosted in [[Toronto]] to combat homelessness.
