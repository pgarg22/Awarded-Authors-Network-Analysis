'''George Shiels''' (24 June 1881 &ndash; 19 September 1949) was an [[Ireland|Irish]] [[dramatist]] whose plays were a success both in his native [[Ulster]] and at the [[Abbey Theatre]] in [[Dublin]].  His most famous plays are ''The Rugged Path'', ''The Passing Day'', and ''The New Gossoon''.

==Biography==
Shiels was born to Robert Shiels and Eileen (n√©e MacSweeney) in [[Ballymoney]], [[County Antrim]], and emigrated to [[Canada]] as a young man. While working on the building of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] in 1913, he was involved in a serious accident that left him in a wheelchair for the rest of his life.  He returned to Ballymoney and started a shipping company with his brother, and also began writing at this time.  Starting with poems and short stories, he soon progressed to plays, which he provided to the Ulster Literary Theatre under the pen name of '''''George S. Morsheils'''''.

Starting with ''Bedmates'' (1921), his plays began to be regularly accepted by the Abbey Theatre for production.  His 1930 work ''The New Gossoon'' was so well-received that the Abbey's touring company, The Abbey Theatre Irish Players, brought the play to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] for limited runs three times, in 1932, 1934, and 1937.  In 1940, a production of Shiels' ''The Rugged Path'' set an Abbey record by attracting a total audience of 25,000 people over eight weeks.

When his success as a playwright allowed him, he left the shipping business and moved to [[Carnlough]] on the coast of County Antrim, where he lived from 1932 until his death in 1949.
