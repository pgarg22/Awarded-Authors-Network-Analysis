'''Charles Kingsley''' (12 June 1819 – 23 January 1875) was a [[broad church]] [[priest]] of the [[Church of England]], a university professor, social reformer, historian, novelist and poet. He is particularly associated with [[Christian socialism]], the [[working men's college]], and forming [[labour cooperatives]], which failed, but encouraged later working reforms. He was a friend and correspondent of [[Charles Darwin]].<ref name="Hale2011">{{Cite journal |last1=Hale |first1=Piers J. |title=Darwin's Other Bulldog: Charles Kingsley and the Popularisation of Evolution in Victorian England |journal=Science & Education |volume=21 |issue=7 |year=2011 |pages=977–1013 |issn=0926-7220 |doi=10.1007/s11191-011-9414-8 |s2cid=144142263 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304022916/http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/H/Piers.J.Hale-1/DARWIN'S%20OTHER%20BULLDOG%202011.pdf

==Life and character==
[[File:Charles Kingsley Vanity Fair 30 March 1872.jpg|thumb|left|Caricature by [[Adriano Cecioni]] published in [[Vanity Fair (UK magazine)|''Vanity Fair'']] in 1872.]]
Kingsley was born in [[Holne]], [[Devon]], the elder son of the Reverend Charles Kingsley and his wife, Mary Lucas Kingsley. His brother [[Henry Kingsley]] (1830–1876) and sister [[Charlotte Chanter]] (1828–1882) also became writers. He was the father of the novelist [[Lucas Malet]] (Mary St. Leger Kingsley, 1852–1931) and the uncle of the traveller and scientist [[Mary Kingsley]] (1862–1900).

Charles Kingsley's childhood was spent in [[Clovelly]], Devon, where his father was Curate in 1826–1832 and Rector in 1832–1836,<ref>William Griggs, ''A Guide to All Saints Church, Clovelly'', first published 1980, Revised Version 2010, p. 7.</ref> and at [[Barnack]], Northamptonshire. He was educated at [[Bristol Grammar School]] and [[Helston]] Grammar School<ref name="ODNB">{{Cite ODNB |first=Norman |last=Vance |title=Kingsley, Charles (1819–1875) |id=15617}}</ref> before studying at [[King's College London]] and the University of Cambridge. Charles entered [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]], in 1838, and graduated in 1842.<ref>{{acad |id=KNGY838C |name=Kingsley, Charles}}</ref> He chose to pursue priesthood in the Anglican Church. In 1844 he became [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]] of [[Eversley]] in [[Hampshire]]. In 1859 he was appointed chaplain to [[Queen Victoria]].<ref name="Krueger2014">{{Cite book |last=Krueger |first=Christine L. |title=Encyclopedia of British Writers, 19th and 20th Centuries |url={{Google books |plain-url=yes |id=Dnqi3gRxgvQC |page=193}} |year=2014 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |isbn=978-1-4381-0870-4}}</ref><ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |wstitle=Kingsley, Charles |volume=15 |page=817 |noprescript=1}}</ref> In 1860, he became [[Regius Professor of Modern History (Cambridge)|Regius Professor of Modern History]] at the University of Cambridge,<ref name="Krueger2014"/><ref name=EB1911/> and in 1861 a private tutor to the [[Edward VII|Prince of Wales]].<ref name="Krueger2014"/>

In 1869 Kingsley resigned his Cambridge professorship and in 1870–1873 served as a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] of [[Chester Cathedral]]. While there, he founded the [[Chester]] Society for Natural Science, Literature and Art, which was prominent in the establishment of the [[Grosvenor Museum]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cheshirewestandchester.gov.uk/visiting/museums/grosvenor_museum/information_sheets/charles_kingsley.aspx |title=Information Sheet: Charles Kingsley |access-date=19 April 2010 |publisher=[[Cheshire West and Chester]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716142034/http://www.cheshirewestandchester.gov.uk/visiting/museums/grosvenor_museum/information_sheets/charles_kingsley.aspx |archive-date=16 July 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 1872 he agreed to become the 19th President of the [[Birmingham and Midland Institute]].<ref>Presidents of the BMI, BMI, nd (c. 2005).</ref> In 1873 he was made a canon of [[Westminster Abbey]].<ref name="Krueger2014"/>

Kingsley sat on the 1866 Edward Eyre Defence Committee along with [[Thomas Carlyle]], [[John Ruskin]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[John Tyndall]], and [[Alfred Lord Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]], where he supported Jamaican Governor [[Edward Eyre]]'s brutal suppression of the [[Morant Bay Rebellion]] against the [[Jamaica Committee]].

One of his daughters, Mary St Leger Kingsley, became known as a novelist under the pseudonym [[Lucas Malet]].<ref name=EB1911/> 
Kingsley's biography, written by his widow in 1877, was entitled ''Charles Kingsley, his Letters and Memories of his Life''.<ref name=EB1911/>

Kingsley received letters from [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Thomas Huxley]] in 1860 and in 1863 letters discussing Huxley's early ideas on [[agnosticism]].

==Death==
Charles Kingsley died of pneumonia on 23 January 1875 at Eversley, Hampshire, aged 55. He was buried there in St. Mary's Churchyard.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20200703102705/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/45b0/890feb197f4ebde7cfbb5d003c2314571694.pdf J. I. Y.

==Influences and works==
Kingsley's interest in history is shown in several of his writings, including ''The Heroes'' (1856), a children's book about [[Greek mythology]], and several historical novels, of which the best known are ''[[Hypatia (novel)|Hypatia]]'' (1853), ''[[Hereward the Wake (novel)|Hereward the Wake]]'' (1865) and ''[[Westward Ho! (novel)|Westward Ho!]]'' (1855).

[[File:Charles Kingsley - project Gutenberg eText 13103.jpg|thumb|left|Kingsley]]
He was sympathetic to the idea of [[evolution]] and was one of the first to welcome [[Charles Darwin]]'s book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. He had been sent an advance review copy and in his response of 18 November 1859 (four days before the book went on sale) stated that he had "long since, from watching the crossing of domesticated animals and plants, learnt to disbelieve the dogma of the permanence of species."<ref>{{Harvnb |Darwin |1887 |p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1452.2&viewtype=text&pageseq=303 287].}}</ref> Darwin added an edited version of Kingsley's closing remarks to the next edition of his book, stating, "A celebrated author and divine has written to me that 'he has gradually learnt to see that it is just as noble a conception of the Deity to believe that He created a few original forms capable of self-development into other and needful forms, as to believe that He required a fresh act of creation to supply the voids caused by the action of His laws.'"<ref>{{Harvnb |Darwin |1860 |p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F376&viewtype=text&pageseq=499 481].}}</ref> When a heated dispute lasting three years developed over [[human evolution]], Kingsley gently satirised the debate, known as the ''[[Great Hippocampus Question]]'', as the "Great Hippopotamus Question".

Kingsley's concern for social reform is illustrated in his classic, ''[[The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby]]'' (1863), a tale about a boy [[chimney sweep]], which retained its popularity well into the 20th century. The story mentions the main protagonists in the scientific debate over human origins, rearranging his earlier satire as the "great hippopotamus test". The book won a [[Lewis Carroll Shelf Award]] in 1963.

Kingsley's chief asset as a novelist lay in his descriptive faculties: the descriptions of South American scenery in ''Westward Ho!'', of the [[Sahara Desert|Egyptian desert]] in ''Hypatia'', and of the [[North Devon]] scenery in ''Two Years Ago''. American scenery is vividly and truthfully described (despite Kingsley having seen it only in his imagination) in his work ''At Last'', written after he had visited the tropics. His sympathy with children taught him how to gain their interest. His version of the old Greek stories entitled ''The Heroes'', and ''Water-babies'' and ''Madam How and Lady Why'', in which he deals with popular natural history, take high rank among books for children.<ref name=EB1911/> Kingsley was influenced by [[Frederick Denison Maurice]], and was close to many Victorian thinkers and writers, including the Scottish writer [[George MacDonald]].

Kingsley was highly critical of [[Roman Catholicism]] and his argument in print with [[John Henry Newman]], accusing him of untruthfulness and deceit, prompted the latter to write his ''[[Apologia Pro Vita Sua]]''.<ref name="Donoghue">{{Cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/the-water-babies-a-fairy-tale-for-a-land-baby-by-charles-kingsley-1.1379367 |title=The Water-Babies: A Fairy Tale for a Land-Baby, by Charles Kingsley.

Kingsley coined the term ''[[pteridomania]]'' in his 1855 book ''Glaucus, or the Wonders of the Shore''.<ref name="Boyd1993">{{Cite web |url=http://www.peterboyd.com/pteridomania.htm |first=Peter D. A. |last=Boyd |title= Pteridomania – the Victorian passion for ferns |website=peterboyd.com |date=1993}}</ref>

==Racial views==
===Anglo-Saxonism===
Kingsley was a fervent [[Anglo-Saxonism|Anglo-Saxonist]],<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Frankel |first1=Robert |date=2007 |title=Observing America: The Commentary of British Visitors to the United States, 1890–1950 (Studies in American Thought and Culture) |publisher=[[University of Wisconsin Press]] |isbn=978-0299218805 |pages=54 |quote=By midcentury such other eminent figures as Thomas Arnold and Charles Kingsley were also exalting the Anglo-the Saxon race. An essential feature of Anglo-Saxonism was the recognition of the race's Teutonic origins.}}</ref> and was seen as a major proponent of the ideology, particularly in the 1840s.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Miller |first1=Brook |date=2011 |title=America and the British Imaginary in Turn-of-the-Twentieth-Century Literature |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |isbn=978-0230103764}}</ref> He proposed that the English people were "essentially a Teutonic race, blood-kin to the Germans, Dutch, Scandinavians".<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Longley |first1=Edna |date=2001 |title=Poetry and Posterity |publisher=[[Bloodaxe Books]] |isbn=978-1852244354}}</ref> Kingsley suggested there was a "strong Norse element in Teutonism and Anglo-Saxonism".

Mixing mythology and Christianity, he blended Protestantism as it was practised at the time with the [[Old Norse religion]], saying that the [[Church of England]] was "wonderfully and mysteriously fitted for the souls of a free Norse-Saxon race". He believed the ancestors of Anglo-Saxons, Norse and [[Germanic peoples]] had physically fought beside the god [[Odin]], and that the British monarchy was genetically descended from the god.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Horsman |first1=Reginald |date=1976 |title=Origins of Racial Anglo-Saxonism in Great Britain before 1850 |edition=Journal of the History of Ideas – Vol. 37, No. 3 |publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]] |pages=76}}</ref>

===Dislike of the Irish===
Kingsley has been accused of [[Anti-Irish sentiment|intensely antagonistic views of the Irish]],<ref name="Donoghue"/> whom he described in derogatory terms.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=McCourt |first1=John |date=2015 |title=Writing the Frontier: Anthony Trollope between Britain and Ireland |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |pages=28 |isbn=978-0198729600}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last1=McCourt |first1=John |date=2015 |title=Representing Race: Racisms, Ethnicity and the Media |publisher=[[SAGE Publishing]] |pages=3 |isbn=978-0761969129}}</ref>

Visiting [[County Sligo]] in Ireland, he wrote a letter to his wife from [[Markree Castle]] in 1860: "I am haunted by the human chimpanzees I saw along that hundred miles of horrible country [Ireland]... [for] to see white chimpanzees is dreadful; if they were black, one would not see it so much, but their skins, except where tanned by exposure, are as white as ours."<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/11/opinion/11davis-sub.html?_r=0 |title=When English Eyes Are Smiling |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=11 March 2007 |access-date=25 September 2016 |author=Davis, Wes}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last1=Michie |first1=Elsie B. |date=1976 |title=Outside the Pale: Cultural Exclusion, Gender Difference, and the Victorian Woman Writer (Reading Women Writing) |publisher=[[Cornell University Press]] |pages=[https://archive.org/details/outsidepalecultu00mich/page/49 49] |chapter=The Simianization of the Irish |isbn=978-0801480850 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/outsidepalecultu00mich/page/49}}</ref>

==Legacy==
[[File:Charles Kingsley - Bideford (2006-03-04).jpg|thumb|180px|right|A statue of Charles Kingsley at [[Bideford]], Devon (UK)]]
Charles Kingsley's novel ''[[Westward Ho! (novel)|Westward Ho!]]'' led to the founding of [[Westward Ho!|a village]] by the same name (the only place name in England with an exclamation mark) and inspired the construction of the [[Bideford, Westward Ho! and Appledore Railway]]. A hotel in Westward Ho! was named after and opened by him. A hotel which was opened in 1897 in [[Bloomsbury]], London, and named after Kingsley was founded by [[teetotallers]], who admired Kingsley for his political views and his ideas on social reform. It still exists as ''The Kingsley by Thistle''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thistle.com/en/hotels/united_kingdom/london/the_kingsley/index.html |title=The Kingsley |website=thistle.com |access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref>

In 1905 the composer [[Cyril Rootham]] wrote a musical setting of Kingsley's poem ''Andromeda''. This was performed at the Bristol Music Festival in 1908. Like Kingsley, Rootham had been educated at Bristol Grammar School.<ref>[https://rootham.org/ Composer's website. Retrieved 2 May 2020.]</ref>
