'''Francis de Croisset''' ({{IPA-fr|fʁɑ̃sis də kʁwasɛ|lang}}; born Franz Wiener, 28 January 1877 – 8 November 1937) was a Belgian-born [[France|French]] [[playwright]] and [[opera]] [[librettist]].

==Early life==
Born as Franz Wiener, he was educated in [[Brussels]] on 28 January 1877 into a prominent Jewish-Belgian family that was distinguished in diplomacy and the army.<ref name="FdCObit1937"/> His parents were Alexandre Jacques Wiener and Eugenie Bertha ([[née]] Straus) Wiener. After moving to France, where he spent most of his life, he had his name changed by Presidential decree.<ref name="FdCObit1937"/>

At age 17, he rebelled against his parents' wishes that he take up a military career, and ran away to Paris. In 1901, his play ''Chérubin'' was produced at the [[Comédie-Française]] where [[Cécile Sorel]] (later the Comtesse de Ségur) made her debut in it. [[Jules Massenet]] set ''[[Chérubin]]'' to music and, in 1905, [[Mary Garden]] sang its première at the [[Opéra de Monte-Carlo]].<ref name="FdCObit1937"/>

He was a lawyer by profession, but de Croisset gradually devoted more and more time to the theatre, "until play writing became his vocation."<ref name="FdCObit1937"/>

His opera librettos include [[Massenet]]'s ''[[Chérubin]]'' (1905), based on his play of the same name, and [[Reynaldo Hahn]]'s ''Ciboulette'' (1923).<ref>{{cite book|author1=Stanley Hochman|author2=McGraw-Hill, inc|title=McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of World Drama: An International Reference Work in 5 Volumes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VGNJxj9qnEkC&pg=PA565|year=1984|publisher=VNR AG|isbn=978-0-07-079169-5|pages=565}}</ref>

In 1919, de Croisset went to the United States to study film for the French government. By 1927, his name was attached to more than fifty plays. In 1925, he collaborated with [[Somerset Maugham]] on ''Dr. Miracle'', which was produced in New York City.<ref name="FdCObit1937"/> Additional plays were produced in New York, including ''Pierre or Jack?''.<ref name="1931Comedy">{{cite news |title=GETS DE CROISSET COMEDY.; Gilbert Miller Has American Rights to "Pierre or Jack?" |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1931/04/23/archives/gets-de-croisset-comedy-gilbert-miller-has-american-rights-to.html?searchResultPosition=4 |accessdate=23 June 2020 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=23 April 1931}}</ref>

===Military service===
Notwithstanding his aversion to a career in the military, upon the outbreak of [[World War I]], he enlisted in the [[French Army]] as a private, serving for four years before mustering out as a [[Lieutenant]]. He was twice decorated for his gallantry, including being awarded the [[Croix de guerre 1914–1918 (France)|Croix de Guerre]] for his valor.<ref name="FdCObit1937"/>
