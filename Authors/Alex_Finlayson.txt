'''Alex Finlayson''' is an American [[playwright]] whose sly irreverent plays found more success on the [[England|English]] stage than in the United States.  After winning Finlayson  a [[Mobil Oil]] International Playwriting Prize, ''Winding the Ball'' was produced by The [[Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester]], which also commissioned and produced Finlayson's ''Misfits'' (1996) and ''Tobaccoland'' (1999).  All three plays starred American stage and film actress [[Lisa Eichhorn]] and were directed by [[Greg Hersov]].

Hersov has written that Finlayson creates "vivid and authentic worlds underpinned by a fiercely personal moral vision.  She deals with the most private sides of our lives but sees them in terms of the history and culture of her country."<ref>''Plays by Alex Finlayson'' (Foreword by Greg Hersov). London: Oberon Books, 1998. {{ISBN|1-870259-69-6}}.</ref> Reviewing ''Tobaccoland'',<ref>Alex Finlayson, ''Tobaccoland''. London: Oberon Books, 1999. {{ISBN|1-84002-081-4}}.</ref> [[Stephen Gallagher]] says that Finlayson “fuses the epic and the intimate to deliver a play that should propel her into that category of American dramatists once dominated by [[Arthur Miller]] and [[Tennessee Williams]].” <ref>Gallagher, Stephen. "In Manchester", ''Plays International'', July/August 1999.</ref>  Finlayson's play ''Winding the Ball'' was praised for being "gripping, luridly funny" <ref>[[John Peter (critic)|Peter, John]]. ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', 5 November 1989.</ref> and  "splendidly assured, with wit and perception that bespeak a major talent. Even [its] symbolism-- that Achilles heel of much American drama- packs a powerful punch."<ref>Hoyle, Martin. "A Shot Let Loose on the Town," ''[[Financial Times]]'', 28 October 1989</ref> It won actor [[David Schofield (actor)|David Schofield]] a Best Actor award from the Manchester Evening News.<ref>[http://www.marcusevanskma.com/admin/uploads/davidschofield_8.pdf Ken McCreddie Associates]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Finlayson's most controversial play is ''Misfits'', inspired by Arthur Miller's autobiography, ''[[Timebends]]''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=TF3MmJZ4t3wC&pg=PT100&lpg=PT100&dq=Alex+Finlayson+Royal+Exchange+Theatre&source=bl&ots=qMwzCCpl-c&sig=g1JTgPd2giPAXyXm6KQuzkuKSAY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bRqcUIO_C6f1iwKi4YHQCQ&ved=0CEIQ6AEwAzge#v=onepage&q&f=false Greg Hersov, REMEMBERING ARTHUR MILLER edited by Christopher Bigsby]</ref> Finlayson was intrigued by Miller's account of the 1961 film [[The Misfits (1961 film)|The Misfits]] as a "valentine" for his wife [[Marilyn Monroe]].   Her play ''Misfits'' portrays the film's historic box office and artistic failure as the casual fault of screenwriter Miller, director [[John Huston]], and [[film producer|producer]] Frank Taylor, and not its star, [[Marilyn Monroe]], who is most often blamed for the film disaster.  ''Misfits'' received mixed reviews, with some critics attacking Finlayson for daring to put Miller onstage as a character.  However, ''[[The Times]]'' proclaimed the play "riveting" and "inventive."<ref>Kingston, Jeremy. "A Hit at Long Last," ''[[The Times]]'', 13 May 1996.</ref> Perhaps not surprising, given Miller's stature, U.S. theaters steered clear of ''Misfits.''  But in a dramatic twist worthy of the stage, Arthur Miller may have had the final word.  His last play, [[Finishing the Picture]] (Goodman Theatre, Chicago 2004),  presented his version of Marilyn Monroe and the making of [[The Misfits (1961 film)|The Misfits (film)]] eleven years after Finlayson’s ''Misfits'' debuted.<ref>[http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/guilt-by-association-dont-mess-with-arthur-miller-green-ties-black-skies/Content?oid=916646 Don't Mess With Arthur Miller, ''Chicago Reader'']</ref>

Alex Finlayson was born and grew up in East Texas the daughter of an actor.  After a brief career as a New York advertising copywriter, she taught herself to write plays by moving to a remote cabin in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] and studying the work of playwrights she admired.  Finlayson was an early protege of Julia Miles and the [[Women's Project]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=cKOSkzqeQYkC&pg=PP7&lpg=PP7&dq=The+women%27s+project+%22Alex+Finlayson%22&source=bl&ots=uEJZkLoSr8&sig=7kc4lmY1FbHVVwKld3cpE5TA0z0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=RNmbUIGLMoWWiAKcm4HIDw&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false Introduction;  WomensWork: Five New Plays] from the [[Women's Project]]  By Julia Miles</ref>  Her first play, ''Ladies' Side'', was produced by the Source Theatre, [[Washington D.C.]] and received a [[Helen Hayes]] nomination for Best New Play.<ref>[http://www.theatrewashington.org/hha-nominees?field_award_year_value_many_to_one=1986 Helen Hayes Awards and Nominees 1986]</ref>  Another early play ''World of Beauty'' won the Texas Playwrights Festival (1988)at [[Stages Repertory Theatre]], [[Houston]] while Ted Swindley was Artistic Director.
