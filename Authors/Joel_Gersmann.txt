'''Joel Gersmann''' (August 26, 1942 – June 24, 2005) was an American [[playwright]] of [[experimental theatre]].  During his 35 years as artistic director at [[Broom Street Theater]], Gersmann was fearless in the subject matter of his plays, with no regard to the reactions of politicians, his audience, or granting organizations.<ref>{{cite web|last=McKinley|first=Jesse|title=Joel Gersmann, Director of Experimental Theater Company, Dies at 62|url=http://theater.nytimes.com/2005/07/06/theater/06ersmann.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 20, 2013|date=July 6, 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Robbins|first=Dean|title=Joel Gersmann: Rebel without a pause|url=http://www.thedailypage.com/isthmus/article.php?article=33005|publisher=The Isthmus|access-date=April 7, 2011}}</ref>  He did, however, receive consistent support from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] from 1973 through 1990,<ref>{{cite news|last=Moore|first=Bill|title=Peer-panel rejected Broom Street grant|newspaper=Wisconsin State Journal|date=August 8, 1990|location=Madison, Wisconsin|pages=1D–2D}}</ref> was awarded grants from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]],<ref name=gussow>{{cite news|last=Gussow|first=Mel|title=Grants To Playwrights —A Look Backstage|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 1, 1978|pages=1, 18 (Arts)}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Campbell|first=Genie|title=Broom Street Theater has won a following|newspaper=Wisconsin State Journal|date=January 28, 1979|location=Madison, Wisconsin|page=1, Section 7}}</ref> and obtained financial support from numerous state and local arts organizations.<ref>{{cite news|last=Campbell|first=Genie|title=Playwright beats odds to stage 'Hangwoman'|newspaper=Wisconsin State Journal|date=September 14, 1986|location=Madison, Wisconsin|page=4, Section 6}}</ref>  Many authors, playwrights, and actors have credited Gersmann as a major influence in their work.<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Levin, Daniel | date=April 2012 | title=Filthy Theater: A Film About Joel Gersmann | medium=Motion picture}}</ref>  The [[Wisconsin Center for Film and Theater Research]] at the [[Wisconsin State Historical Society]] houses a collection of Gersmann's manuscripts and papers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Joel Gersmann Papers, 1969-2005|url=http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/wiarchives.uw-whs-m2009019|publisher=University of Wisconsin Digital Collections|access-date=May 12, 2013}}</ref>  He is the subject of the 2012 documentary film ''Filthy Theater''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Filthy Theater: A Film About Joel Gersmann|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2488284/|publisher=IMDb|access-date=May 12, 2013}}</ref>

== Biography ==

=== Early life and education ===

Joel Gersmann was born in [[Brooklyn]], New York on August 26, 1942, to John and Irma Gersmann. When he was one, his family left New York City for [[Clifton, New Jersey]], where his sister Gayle was born in 1945.  The family moved once again to [[Passaic, New Jersey]] in 1954, where Gersmann spent the remainder of his childhood, graduating from Passaic High School in 1960.  He entered [[Rutgers University]] as an accounting major in 1960, switched to English, and finally settled on the study of theater, earning his undergraduate degree in 1964 and MFA from [[Adelphi University]] in 1966. Gersmann was strongly influenced by professor Jacques Burdick while at Adelphi. Gersmann then served two years in the US Army as a sergeant, and managed the Post Movie Theater in [[Fort Monroe]], Virginia. After trying his hand for a few months as a newspaper reporter, Gersmann reconnected with Professor Burdick (who had received his PhD from [[UW-Madison]]), and was persuaded to study Asian theater under A.C. Scott in a doctoral program at the UW.<ref name="McKinleyJesse" /><ref>{{cite web|last=Goff|first=Nadine|title=Goodbye, Joel Gersmann Pushed Madison Theater to Innovative Levels|url=http://host.madison.com/article_9d3a9ab3-b597-5447-babf-9a862d7c438c.html|publisher=Wisconsin State Journal|access-date=April 20, 2013|date=June 29, 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Gersmann|first=Joel|title=Joel Gersmann talks to himself|newspaper=Take Over|date=January 8–22, 1975|location=Madison, Wisconsin|pages=12–13|format=Volume 5, Number 1}}</ref>

=== Career and artistic works ===

Gersmann's directorial debut was with ''Quixote'' literary magazine, starting with ''[[Under Milk Wood]]'',<ref>{{cite news|last=Waxman|first=Howard|title=Gersmann Of Broom Street Part I|newspaper=The Isthmus|date=October 8–14, 1976|location=Madison, Wisconsin|pages=3, 5}}</ref> which included [[André DeShields]] in the cast.<ref>{{cite news|title=Two Plays at Broom Street|newspaper=The Capital Times|date=August 11, 1969|author=editorial staff|location=Madison, Wisconsin|page=4 "Green" section}}</ref>  After several productions with ''Quixote'', Gersmann was invited to direct Broom Street Theater's second show, ''Woycek'', which opened in July 1969. He directed two more plays for Broom Street in 1969, and by June 1970 assumed the role of artistic director.

By the fall of 1970, he terminated his academic career, after passing his preliminaries, to devote all his time to creating theater and writing.  He toured several Broom Street productions, expanded beyond theater to write a book of poetry,<ref>{{cite book|last=Gersmann|first=Joel|title=Deep Shit: pomes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rmdHHAAACAAJ|publisher=Broom Street Theater Press|year=1971|access-date=May 4, 2013}}</ref> create theater with high school students at Freedom House,<ref>{{cite news|last=LaBrasca|first=Robert|title='Days of Our Years' leaves cast confused|newspaper=The Capital Times|date=August 10, 1974|location=Madison, Wisconsin|page=10}}</ref> shoot 16&nbsp;mm film, record television/video productions,<ref>{{cite news|last=LaBrasca|first=Robert|title=Broom Street Theater Tape Show|newspaper=The Capital Times|date=May 12, 1973|location=Madison, Wisconsin|page=4 (Music, Movies, Art, Drama)}}</ref> and produce radio dramas.  Some of his longer term interests included writing poetry reviews, and a lifelong passion for opera and classical music,<ref>{{cite news|last=Campbell|first=Genie|title=Joel Gersmann: Theater is his life|newspaper=Wisconsin State Journal|date=September 1, 1991|location=Madison, Wisconsin|page=2H}}</ref> exemplified in several years of opera programming on local radio station [[WORT]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Jess|title=Radio Broadcaster: being a media star|url=http://www.jessanderson.org/doc/radio_work.html|access-date=May 5, 2013}}</ref>

However, by late 1976, Gersmann abandoned many of these side projects to focus on purchasing a building for Broom Street Theater,<ref>{{cite news|last=Wagner|first=Dave|title=Broom Street Theater plans to buy building on Williamson|newspaper=The Capital Times|date=November 18, 1976|location=Madison, Wisconsin|page=54}}</ref> which he accomplished in the fall of 1977.  With the theater owning its own space, Gersmann settled into a pattern of writing and directing three to four out of Broom Street's seven annual theatrical productions per year, for the next twenty years.<ref name="McKinleyJesse">McKinley, Jesse</ref>  During this period, he also managed the day-to-day operations of the theater, and mentored other local playwright/directors.  By 1997, Gersmann was able to reduce his own output to one or two original works per season, due to Broom Street's increasing pool of creative talent.

Gersmann was also a longtime contributing writer for Madison's [[alternative weekly]] newspaper ''[[Isthmus (newspaper)|Isthmus]]'', for which he wrote classical album reviews and other pieces since 1976, the paper's first year of existence.<ref>''Isthmus'', Sept. 3, 1976</ref>

=== Final years ===

[[File:Joel Gersmann at Broom Street Theater, Jan 2005.jpg|thumb|right| 250px |Gersmann, left, as Harry Hay]]
From 1998 until his death, Gersmann studied ancient Greek, and made his own translations into English of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]''.  His wide-ranging interest in poetry, music, and literature continued at this time in his life, and the booklist reviews he wrote for ''Isthmus''<ref>{{cite news|last=Gersmann|first=Joel|title=A Year Of Reading Dangerously|newspaper=The Isthmus|date=January 4, 1985|location=Madison, Wisconsin|pages=9, 10, 16}}</ref> since the early 80s kept on until his death. Gersmann had an encyclopedic knowledge of jazz and classical music recordings. He meticulously acquired an enormous collection of CDs.

After being misdiagnosed with asthma for years (an illness which was the topic and title of one of his plays), Gersmann suffered a heart attack in the summer of 2002, which was the first year he did not produce an original play since 1968.  His final two original works debuted in 2003, part of his biographical series of plays, the first on sexologist [[Alfred Kinsey]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Lynch|first=Kevin|title=Sex Ed On Stage|newspaper=The Capital Times|date=January 10, 2003|location=Madison, Wisconsin|page=1B}}</ref> and the second on the economist [[John Maynard Keynes]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Henry|first=Amanda|title="The Ballerina and the Economist" BroomStreet Theater, through Dec, 14, tickets available only at the door|newspaper=Wisconsin State Journal|date=November 12, 2003|location=Madison, Wisconsin|page=B5}}</ref>  His final acting role was his portrayal of [[Harry Hay]] in Callen Harty's original play ''Radical Harry'' in January 2005.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lynch|first=Kevin|title=After 'Harry,' Gersmann's acting days over|newspaper=The Capital Times|date=January 26, 2005|location=Madison, Wisconsin|pages=1D, 3D}}</ref>

On June 24, 2005, Gersmann died of congestive heart failure, at the age of 62.  From 1968 until his death, he directed 114 plays, 88 of them original works.

== Quotes ==

*"Theater is dead!"
*"I want to start with art and work towards trash."
*"I'm trying to figure out how much not to write."
*"It's so trashy, I love it!"
*"Keep it!"
*"The play just died, people!"
*"I don't believe in happiness."

== Influences and style ==

Gersmann's theatrical style was minimalist in terms of props and costumes, with a strong emphasis on movement and physicality. Vsevolod Meyerhold of the Moscow Art Theater was his hero and a major influence. Gersmann's aesthetic can be traced to the influence of his mentor, Jacques Burdick, professor of Theater at Adelphi University.<ref>Goff, Nadine</ref>  Burdick, in turn, was influenced by [[Jerzy Grotowski]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Daly|first=Owen|title=Thoughts on Jerzy Grotowski|url=http://owendaly.com/jeff/jsactng1.htm|access-date=April 25, 2013}}</ref>

Starting with his very early work, Gersmann wrote his plays during the rehearsal process, tailoring the script to the abilities of his cast.<ref>{{cite news|last=Schreiner|first=Dave|title=And the director|newspaper=The Bugle-American|date=October 15–21, 1970|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|page=16}}</ref> The emphasis on physicality was described by Gersmann as his kinoplastic aesthetic, where, in order to enable rapid scene changes, cast members would portray set pieces and scenery.  For many years, Gersmann often refused to allow intermissions for any of the shows performed at Broom Street Theater, and he himself rarely used them.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cambell|first=Genie|title='Running' is on right track|newspaper=Wisconsin State Journal|date=November 26, 1979|location=Madison, Wisconsin|page=5, Section 3}}</ref>  In shows he directed, Gersmann would only permit the cast a curtain call on closing night.

== Reception ==

One constant throughout Gersmann's career was negative critical response.  Although acclaim was not uncommon, his productions were often criticized for being too long, with unpolished writing, actors screaming their lines, and repeating themes ad nauseam, both in specific plays, and in his work as a whole.<ref>{{cite news|last=Coenraad|first=Susan|title='Normal Love' at 16 Nets a Normal Laugh|newspaper=Wisconsin State Journal|date=May 22, 1971|location=Madison, Wisconsin|page=15, Section 2}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Davies|first=Donald K.|title=One man show a hit|newspaper=Wisconsin State Journal|date=February 14, 1977|location=Madison, Wisconsin|page=3, Section 3}}</ref><ref>Henry, Amanda</ref>  At the same time, the physicality and energy in his plays were seen as inspired, which drew a steady flow of new actors and directors.  In the more metropolitan areas where Broom Street toured, reviews were often positive.  Gersmann was recognized nationally as a pioneer of experimental theater.<ref name="McKinleyJesse" /><ref>{{cite news|last=Gussow|first=Mel|title=Grants to Playwrights— A Look Backstage|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 1, 1978|pages=1, 18 (Arts?)}}</ref> [[Megan Terry]], of [[The Open Theater]] in New York, and [[Magic Theatre (Omaha)|Magic Theater]] in Omaha, said, "Joel is nationally recognized.  We bring his productions here, and our audiences love him."<ref>{{cite news|last=Prajer|first=Karen|title=Broom Street's Gersmann laments playwright limits|newspaper=The Capital Times|date=September 11, 1986|location=Madison, Wisconsin|page=42}}</ref>
