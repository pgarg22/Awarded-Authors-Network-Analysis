'''Peter Handke''' ({{IPA-de|ˈpeːtɐ ˈhantkə}}; born 6 December 1942) is an Austrian novelist, playwright, translator, poet, film director, and screenwriter. He was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 2019 "for an influential work that with linguistic ingenuity has explored the periphery and the specificity of human experience."<ref name=Nobel>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/2019/summary/|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 2019|website=NobelPrize.org}}</ref> Though some praised Handke as a meritorious laureate, the decision to award him a Nobel Prize was also denounced internationally by a variety of public and academic intellectuals, writers, and journalists, who cited his support of the late [[Slobodan Milošević]] and [[Bosnian genocide denial]].

In the late 1960s, he was recognized for the plays ''[[Offending the Audience|Publikumsbeschimpfung]]'' (''Offending the Audience'') and ''[[Kaspar (play)|Kaspar]]'', as well as the novel ''[[The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick|Die Angst des Tormanns beim Elfmeter]]'' (''The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick''). Prompted by his mother's suicide in 1971, he reflected her life in the novel ''[[A Sorrow Beyond Dreams|Wunschloses Unglück]]'' (''A Sorrow Beyond Dreams''). Handke was a member of the ''[[Grazer Gruppe]]'' (an association of authors) and the [[Grazer Autorenversammlung]], and co-founded the Verlag der Autoren publishing house in Frankfurt. He collaborated with director [[Wim Wenders]],  leading to screenplays such as ''[[The Wrong Move]]'' and ''[[Wings of Desire|Der Himmel über Berlin]]'' (''Wings of Desire'').

== Life ==
=== Early life and family ===
Handke was born in [[Griffen, Austria|Griffen]], then in the [[German Reich]]'s province [[Gau Carinthia]].<ref name="Britannica" /> His father, Erich Schönemann, was a bank clerk and German soldier whom Handke did not meet until adulthood. His mother Maria, a [[Carinthian Slovenes|Carinthian Slovene]], married Bruno Handke, a tram conductor and [[Wehrmacht]] soldier from Berlin, before Peter was born.<ref name="Munzinger" /> The family lived in the Soviet-occupied [[Pankow (locality)|Pankow]] district of Berlin from 1944 to 1948, where Maria Handke had two more children: Peter's half-sister and half-brother. Then the family moved to his mother's home town of Griffen. Peter experienced his stepfather as more and more violent due to [[alcoholism]].<ref name="Munzinger" /><!-- and the limited cultural life of the small town contributed to Handke's antipathy to habit and restrictiveness. -- look for ref-->

In 1954, Handke was sent to the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] ''Marianum'' boys' [[boarding school]] at [[Tanzenberg Castle]] in [[Sankt Veit an der Glan]]. There, he published his first writing in the school newspaper, ''Fackel''.<ref name="Munzinger" /> In 1959, he moved to [[Klagenfurt]], where he went to high school, and commenced law studies at the [[University of Graz]] in 1961.<ref name="Britannica" />

Handke's mother took her own life in 1971, reflected in his novel ''[[A Sorrow Beyond Dreams|Wunschloses Unglück]]'' (''A Sorrow Beyond Dreams'').<ref name="Britannica" /><ref>{{cite news |last1=Curwen |first1=Thomas |title=Choosing against life |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2003-jan-05-bk-curwen5-story.html |access-date=11 October 2019 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=5 January 2003}}</ref>

After leaving Graz, Handke lived in [[Düsseldorf]], Berlin, [[Kronberg im Taunus|Kronberg]], Paris, the U.S. (1978 to 1979) and [[Salzburg]] (1979 to 1988).<ref name="Wenders" /> Since 1990, he has resided in [[Chaville]] near Paris.<ref>[https://sz-magazin.sueddeutsche.de/literatur/messie-und-messias-78494 Messie und Messias / Wie wohnt eigentlich der Schriftsteller Peter Handke?

As of early November 2019, there was an official investigation by the relevant authorities into whether Handke may have automatically lost his [[Austrian citizenship]] upon obtaining a Yugoslav passport and nationality in the late 1990s.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://apnews.com/c5501b12c92d47b9945957141d14fbdc  |title=Nobel Prize Winner Handke Admits Having Yugoslav Passport |date=8 November 2019 |work=The Associated Press |agency=AP |access-date=25 November 2019}}</ref>

=== Career ===
While studying, Handke established himself as a writer, linking up with the ''[[Grazer Gruppe]]'' (the [[Graz]] Authors' Assembly), an association of young writers.<ref name="Wenders" /> The group published a magazine on literature, ''{{ill|manuskripte|de}}'', which published Handke's early works.<ref name="Britannica" /> Group members included [[Wolfgang Bauer (writer)|Wolfgang Bauer]] and [[Barbara Frischmuth]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wakounig |first1=Marija |title=East Central Europe at a Glance: People – Cultures – Developments |date=2018 |publisher=[[LIT Verlag]] |location=Munster, Germany |isbn=978-3-643-91046-2 |page=302 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EQKDDwAAQBAJ |access-date=11 October 2019}}</ref>

Handke abandoned his studies in 1965,<ref name="Britannica" /> after the German publishing house [[Suhrkamp Verlag]] accepted his novel ''{{ill|Die Hornissen|de}} (The Hornets)'' for publication.<ref name="Suhrkamp" /> He gained international attention after an appearance at a meeting of [[avant-garde]] artists belonging to the [[Gruppe 47]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]], in 1966.<ref name="Hutchinson" /> The same year, his play ''[[Offending the Audience|Publikumsbeschimpfung]]'' (''Offending the Audience'') premiered at the {{ill|Theater am Turm|de}} in Frankfurt, directed by {{ill|Claus Peymann|de}}.<ref name="Suhrkamp" /><ref name="Hutchinson" /> Handke became one of the co-founders of the publishing house {{ill|Verlag der Autoren|de}} in 1969 with a new commercial concept, as it belonged to the authors.<ref>Martin Lüdke: [https://www.deutschlandfunkkultur.de/50-jahre-verlag-der-autoren-mit-enthusiasmus-gegruendet.932.de.html?dram:article_id=443223 50 Jahre "Verlag der Autoren" / Mit Enthusiasmus gegründet] Deutschlandfunk, 11 March 2019</ref> He co-founded the [[Grazer Autorenversammlung]] in 1973<ref>[https://oe1.orf.at/artikel/343066/40-Jahre-Grazer-Autorenversammlung 40 Jahre Grazer Autorenversammlung] ORF 15 June 2013</ref> and was a member until 1977.<ref name="Wenders" />

Handke's first play, ''[[Offending the Audience|Publikumsbeschimpfung]]'' (''Offending the Audience''), which premiered in Frankfurt in 1966 and made him well known,<ref name="Hutchinson" /> was the first of several experimental plays without a conventional plot.<ref name="Britannica" /> In his second play, ''[[Kaspar (play)|Kaspar]]'', he treated the story of [[Kaspar Hauser]] as "an allegory of conformist social pressures".<ref name="Hutchinson" />

Handke has written scripts for films.<ref name="Wenders" /> He directed ''[[Die linkshändige Frau]]'' (''The Left-Handed Woman''), which was released in 1978. ''[[Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide]]'s'' description of the film is that a woman demands that her husband leave and he complies. "Time passes... and the audience falls asleep." The film was nominated for the [[Palme d'Or|Golden Palm Award]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 1978 and won the Gold Award for German Arthouse Cinema in 1980. Handke also won the 1975 German Film Award in Gold for his screenplay for ''[[The Wrong Move|Falsche Bewegung]]'' (''The Wrong Move''). He collaborated with director [[Wim Wenders]] in writing the screenplay for the 1987 film ''[[Wings of Desire|Der Himmel über Berlin]]'' (''Wings of Desire''), including the poem at its opening. Since 1975, Handke has been a jury member of the European literary award [[Petrarca-Preis]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Petrarca Preis |url=http://www.petrarca-preis.de/ |website=www.petrarca-preis.de |access-date=11 October 2019 |language=de}}</ref>

Handke collaborated with director [[Wim Wenders]] on [[The Goalkeeper's Fear of the Penalty|a film version]] of ''[[The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick|Die Angst des Tormanns beim Elfmeter]]'', wrote the script for ''[[The Wrong Move|Falsche Bewegung]]'' (''The Wrong Move'') and co-wrote the screenplay for ''[[Wings of Desire|Der Himmel über Berlin]]'' (''Wings of Desire'') and ''[[The Beautiful Days of Aranjuez|Les Beaux Jours d'Aranjuez]]'' (''The Beautiful Days of Aranjuez'').

In 2019, Handke was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] "for an influential work that with linguistic ingenuity has explored the periphery and the specificity of human experience."<ref name=Nobel/>

==Literary reception==
In 1977, reviewing ''[[A Moment of True Feeling]]'', [[Stanley Kauffmann]] wrote that Handke "is the most important new writer on the international scene since [[Samuel Beckett]]."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Kauffmann|first=Stanley|author-link=Stanley Kauffmann|date=25 June 1977|title=The Novel as Poem|work=[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review]]|page=23}}</ref> [[John Updike]] reviewed the same novel in [[The New Yorker]] and was equally impressed, noting that "there is no denying his [Handke's] willful intensity and knifelike clarity of evocation.

==Views==

In 1996, Handke's [[Travel literature|travelogue]] ''Eine winterliche Reise zu den Flüssen Donau, Save, Morawa und Drina oder Gerechtigkeit für Serbien'' (published in English as ''A Journey to the Rivers: Justice for Serbia'') created controversy, as Handke portrayed [[Serbia]] as being among the victims of the [[Yugoslav Wars]]. In the same essay, Handke also criticised Western media for misrepresenting the causes and consequences of the war.<ref name="Sage-thetimes-2006-Theatre-dismissal">{{cite web |title=Theatre boss's dismissal splits artistic community |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/europe/article2601451.ece |last=Sage |first=Adam |website=The Times |date=29 July 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216130733/http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/europe/article2601451.ece |archive-date=16 February 2017}}</ref><!--Former Yugoslavian president [[Slobodan Milošević]] asked that Handke be summoned as a witness for his defence before the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]], but the writer declined. He did, however, visit the tribunal as a spectator, and later published his observations in ''Die Tablas von Daimiel'' (''The Tablas of Daimiel''). In 1999, [[Salman Rushdie]] wrote that Handke "has astonished even his most fervent admirers by his current series of impassioned apologias for the [[genocidal]] regime of Slobodan Milosevic." Rushdie commented that Handke received the Order of the Serbian Knight from Milošević for his propaganda services during a visit to Belgrade, and that his "previous idiocies include the suggestion that Sarajevo's Muslims regularly massacred themselves and then blamed the Serbs; and his denial of the genocide carried out by Serbs at Srebrenica."<ref name="rushdie">[[Salman Rushdie]], "May 1999," in ''Step Across This Line'', [[Random House]], 2008</ref>In the mid 2000s, Handke's public support of [[Slobodan Milošević]], the former president of Yugoslavia who was indicted for [[war crime]]s by a UN tribunal for his role in the [[Yugoslav Wars]], was considered controversial in the West, including Handke's delivery of a brief speech (partially in [[Serbian language|Serbian]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://handkeonline.onb.ac.at/node/1877|title=Milošević: Ein Begräbnis (2006) &#124; Handke online|website=handkeonline.onb.ac.at}}</ref> at Milošević's funeral on 18 March 2006.<ref name="Britannica" /><ref>[[Joshua Cohen (writer)|Cohen, Joshua]] (30 December 2016)."[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/30/books/review/peter-handke-moravian-night.html Peter Handke’s Time-Traveling Tale of a Europe in Flux]" (review of ''The Moravian Night'').

Mr. Handke’s previous idiocies include the suggestion that Sarajevo’s Muslims regularly massacred themselves and then blamed the Serbs, and his denial of the genocide carried out by Serbs at Srebrenica.

However, disputing such interpretations of his work as listed above as misinterpreted by the English press, Handke has described the Srebrenica massacre as an "infernal vengeance, eternal shame for the Bosnian Serbs responsible."<ref>Peter Handke, "Il faut maintenant sortir de la vision unilatérale de la guerre.

The decision of the [[Swedish Academy|Nobel Committee]] to award Handke a Nobel Prize in literature in 2019 was denounced internationally by a variety of public and academic intellectuals, writers and journalists.  Criticism focuses on the writer's view on the breakup of Yugoslavia and Yugoslav Wars, which has been described as [[Serbophilia|pro-Serbian]], his support of the late [[Slobodan Milošević]], and [[Bosnian genocide denial]].<ref name="Hutchinson-TLS-2019-Handke-curious-canon">{{cite web |author1=Ben Hutchinson |title=Peter Handke: entering the curious canon – Literature |url=https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/entering-curious-canon-handke/ |website=TLS |publisher=[[Times Literary Supplement]] |access-date=20 May 2020 |language=en |date=18 October 2019}}</ref><ref name="Cain-theguardian-2019-Troubling Choice">{{cite web |last1=Cain |first1=Sian |title='A troubling choice': authors criticise Peter Handke's controversial Nobel win |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/10/troubling-choice-authors-criticise-peter-handke-controversial-nobel-win |website=The Guardian |access-date=19 May 2020 |language=en |date=10 October 2019}}</ref><ref name="Staff-Guardian-Stand-up-if-support-Serb"/> The high-profile figures who decried the decision of the Swedish Academy, include individuals such as: [[Deborah Lipstadt]], Holocaust historian, who in her letter published in the [[New York Times]] wrote that the Nobel committee has awarded Handke a platform which "he does not deserve and the public does not need him to have", adding that such platform could convince some that his "false claims must have some legitimacy",<ref name="Lipstadt-NYT-2019-Handke-Undeserving-Nobel">{{cite web |author1=Deborah E.

Or it could be that in the rarefied chambers in Stockholm, Mr. Handke’s anxious goalie is far more real than a woman from Srebrenica whose family was eradicated in the massacre. The choice of Mr. Handke implies a concept of literature safe from the infelicities of history and actualities of human life and death. War and genocide, Milosevic and Srebrenica, the value of the writer’s words and actions at this moment in history, might be of interest to the unsophisticated plebs once subjected to murder and displacement, but not to those who can appreciate “linguistic ingenuity” that “has explored the periphery and the specificity of human experience.” For them, genocide comes and goes, but literature is forever.}}</ref> [[Bora Ćosić]],<ref name="Staff-Guardian-Stand-up-if-support-Serb">{{cite web |last=Traynor |first=Ian |title=Stand up if you support the Serbs |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/apr/21/features11.g28 |work=The Guardian |access-date=18 November 2019 |date=21 April 1999 |quote=This writer, the Austrian, has his very personal style.

Both the Swedish academy and Nobel Committee for Literature members defended their decision to award Handke the Nobel prize. Academy members [[Mats Malm]] and [[Eric M. Runesson]] wrote in the Swedish paper ''Dagens Nyheter'' that Handke had "definitely made provocative, inappropriate and unclear statements on political issues" but that they had "found nothing in what he has written that involves attacks on civil society or respect for the equal value of all people".<ref name="BBC News Peter Handke receives Nobel Literature prize">{{cite news |title=Peter Handke receives Nobel Literature prize |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-50730048 |work=BBC News |date=10 December 2019}}</ref> However, they quoted an article from 2006 in which Handke said the [[Srebrenica massacre]] was the worst [[crime against humanity]] in Europe since [[World War II]].<ref name="BBC News Peter Handke receives Nobel Literature prize" /> Nobel for literature member Henrik Petersen described Handke as "radically unpolitical" in his writings and that this support for Serbs had been misunderstood, while Rebecka Kärde said: "When we give the award to Handke, we argue that the task of literature is other than to confirm and reproduce what society’s central view believes is morally right" adding that the author "absolutely deserves a Nobel Prize".<ref name="BBC News Peter Handke receives Nobel Literature prize" /><ref name="The Guardian Swedish Academy">{{cite news |last1=Flood |first1=Alison |title=This article is more than 6 months old Swedish Academy defends Peter Handke's controversial Nobel win |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/21/swedish-academy-defends-peter-handkes-controversial-nobel-win |work=The Guardian |date=21 October 2019}}</ref>

[[The Intercept]] published a number of articles by [[Peter Maass]] criticizing Peter Handke's [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] reception because of his neutral attitudes towards the [[Srebrenica massacre]] committed by the [[Bosnian Serb]]s. In another article by Intercept, Maass went to great length to call Handke an "exponent of white nationalism". Subsequently, in an interview conducted by Maass in December 2019, asking Handke whether the 1995 [[Srebrenica massacre]] (in which 8,000 unarmed Muslim men and boys were killed by the Bosnian Serb Army of Republika Srpska) had happened, Handke responded: "I prefer toilet paper, an anonymous letter with toilet paper inside, to your empty and ignorant questions." Maass also claims that two Nobel prize jurors were adhering to conspiracy theories with regard to American involvement in the Balkan conflict and that they were "misinformed" about Handke's literary achievements. Germany's [[Eugen Ruge]] also protested against the scale of the criticism. In November 2019, around 120 authors, literary scholars, translators, and artists expressed their unease in an open letter. They felt that the criticism against Handke was no longer rational.<ref>[https://theintercept.com/2019/10/10/congratulations-nobel-committee-you-just-gave-the-literature-prize-to-a-genocide-apologist/ "Congratulations, Nobel Committee, You Just Gave the Literature Prize to a Genocide Apologist"].
