'''Charles Braun Ludlam''' (April 12, 1943 – May 28, 1987) was an [[United States|American]] actor, director, and playwright.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Ludlam was born in [[Floral Park, New York]], the son of Marjorie (née Braun) and Joseph William Ludlam.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/16/books/chapters/ridiculous.html|title=Ridiculous!|last=Kaufman|first=David|date=2003-02-16|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-16|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/96/Charles-Ludlam.html|title=Charles Ludlam Biography (1943–1987)|website=www.filmreference.com|access-date=2018-05-16}}</ref> He was raised in [[Greenlawn, New York]], and attended [[Harborfields High School]]. He was [[Coming out|openly gay]], and performed in plays with the Township Theater Group, a [[Regional theater in the United States|community theatre]] in [[Huntington, New York|Huntington]], and worked backstage at the Red Barn Theater, a [[summer stock theatre]] in [[Northport, New York|Northport]]. During his senior year of high school, Ludlam directed, produced, and performed plays with a group of friends, students from Huntington, Northport, Greenlawn, and Centerport. Their "Students Repertory Theatre", housed in the loft studio beneath the Posey School of Dance on Main Street in Northport, seated an audience of 25, and was sold out for every performance.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} Their repertoire included [[Kan Kikuchi]]'s ''Madman on the Roof''; ''[[openlibrary:books/OL14045017M/The theatre of the soul|Theatre of the Soul]]''; a [[Reader's theatre|readers' theatre]] adaptation of [[Edgar Lee Masters]]' ''[[Spoon River Anthology]]''; and plays by [[August Strindberg]] and [[Eugene O'Neill]].

He received a degree in dramatic literature from [[Hofstra University]] in 1964. At Hofstra, Ludlam met [[Black-Eyed Susan (actress)|Black-Eyed Susan]], whom he cast in one of his college productions. The two became close friends, and Black-Eyed Susan performed in more of Ludlam's plays over the following decades than any other actor, except Ludlam himself.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Simon |first1=Kate |title=Black-Eyed Susan |journal=[[BOMB Magazine]] |volume=Spring 1988 |url=https://bombmagazine.org/articles/black-eyed-susan/ |accessdate=26 July 2020}}</ref>

=== Career ===
Ludlam joined John Vaccaro's [[Play-House of the Ridiculous]], and after a falling out, founded his own Ridiculous Theatrical Company in 1967. His first plays were rudimentary exercises; starting with ''Bluebeard'', he began writing more structured plays, which were often [[pastiche]]s of [[Gothic fiction|gothic novels]]; works by [[Federico Garcia Lorca]], [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], and [[Richard Wagner]]; and popular culture and old movies. These works were humorous but had serious undertones. After seeing one of Ludlam's plays, theater critic [[Brendan Gill]] famously remarked, "This isn't farce. This isn't absurd. This is absolutely ridiculous!". Ludlam commented on his own work: <blockquote>I would say that my work falls into the classical tradition of comedy. Over the years there have been certain traditional approaches to comedy. As a modern artist you have to advance the tradition. I want to work within the tradition so that I don't waste my time trying to establish new conventions. You can be very original within the established conventions.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Castle |first1=Ted |title=Charles Ludlam and Christopher Scott |journal=[[BOMB Magazine]] |volume=Winter 1982 |url=https://bombmagazine.org/articles/charles-ludlam-and-christopher-scott/ |accessdate=26 July 2020}}</ref></blockquote>

Ludlam's ''Bluebeard'' was produced at [[La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club]], where Vaccaro's company was in residence, in March 1970. Ludlam performed in this production as Khanazar von Bluebeard. Black-Eyed-Susan, [[Lola Pashalinski]], and [[Mario Montez]] also performed in this production.<ref>La MaMa Archives Digital Collections.

He taught and/or staged productions at [[New York University]], [[Connecticut College]], [[Yale University]], and [[Carnegie Mellon University]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} He won fellowships from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim]], [[Rockefeller Foundation|Rockefeller]], and [[Ford Foundation]]s, and grants from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] and the [[New York State Council on the Arts]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} He won six [[Obie Award]]s over the course of his career, including a Sustained Excellence [[Obie Award]] two weeks before his death in 1987,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.obieawards.com/events/1980s/year-87/|title=87 {{!}} Obie Awards|work=Obie Awards|access-date=2018-05-16|language=en-US}}</ref> and won the Rosamund Gilder Award for distinguished achievement in the theater in 1986.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Ludlam often appeared in his plays, and was particularly noted for his female roles. He wrote one of the first plays to address, though indirectly, the [[AIDS epidemic]]. His most well-known play is ''[[The Mystery of Irma Vep]]'', in which two actors play seven roles in a pastiche of gothic horror novels. The original production featured Ludlam and his partner Everett Quinton. Rights to perform the play include a stipulation that the actors must be of the same sex, in order to ensure [[cross-dressing]] in the production.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} In 1991, ''Irma Vep'' was the most produced play in the United States;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berkeleyrep.org/HTML/Season0304/IV_programnotes.html|website=Berkeley Repertory Theatre |title=about the rep > past productions > 2003/4 > The Mystery of Irma Vep|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041102165348/http://www.berkeleyrep.org/HTML/Season0304/IV_programnotes.html|archive-date=November 2, 2004}}</ref> and in 2003, it became the longest-running production ever staged in Brazil.<ref>Gussow, Mel.

Ludlam was diagnosed with [[AIDS]] in March 1987. He attempted to fight the disease with his lifelong interest in healthy eating and a [[macrobiotic diet]], but died a month after his AIDS diagnosis, of [[PCP pneumonia]], at [[St. Vincent's Hospital, Manhattan|St. Vincent's Hospital]]. His front page obituary in the New York Times was the newspaper's first page 1 obituary to specifically name AIDS as a cause of death (with Ludlam's parents' consent), instead of the AIDS-related illnesses such as pneumonia commonly cited at the time.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Rosenzweig |first1=Leah |title=Cause of Death: Uncovering the hidden history of AIDS on the New York Times obituary page |url=https://slate.com/human-interest/2018/11/aids-new-york-times-obituary-history.html |accessdate=1 December 2018 |publisher=Slate.com |date=30 November 2018}}</ref> The block in front of his [[West Village|Sheridan Square]] theater was renamed "Charles Ludlam Lane" in his honor.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In 2009, Ludlam was inducted posthumously into the [[American Theater Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/136195-Redgrave-Schwartz-Lloyd-Webber-and-More-Inducted-Into-Theater-Hall-of-Fame-Jan-25 |title=Playbill.com |access-date=2012-09-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203012335/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/136195-Redgrave-Schwartz-Lloyd-Webber-and-More-Inducted-Into-Theater-Hall-of-Fame-Jan-25 |archive-date=2013-12-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> After his death, "Walter Ego", the dummy from Ludlam's 1978 play ''The Ventriloquist's Wife'', was donated to the [[Vent Haven Museum]] in [[Fort Mitchell, Kentucky]], where it remains on exhibit; the puppet was designed and built by actor and puppetmaker Alan Semok.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}
