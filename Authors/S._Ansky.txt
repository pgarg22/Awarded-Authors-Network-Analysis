==Biography==

S. Ansky was born in [[Chashniki]], [[Vitebsk Governorate]], [[Russian Empire]] (now [[Belarus]]), and died in [[Otwock]], [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] on November 8, 1920.

==Ethnographic work==
[[File:An-ski 1910.jpg|thumb|250px|S. Ansky, 1910]]
Under the influence of the Russian [[narodnik]] movement, Ansky became interested in [[ethnography]], as well as socialism, and became a political activist.  Between 1911 and the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, he headed ethnographic expeditions to various Jewish towns of [[Volhynia]] and [[Podolia]], composing a detailed ethnographic questionnaire of more than 2000 questions.<ref>Nathaniel Deutsch, ''The Jewish Dark Continent: Life and Death in the Russian Pale of Settlement''. Harvard University Press, 2011.</ref>

Ansky's ethnographic collections were locked away in Soviet vaults for years, but some material has come to light since the 1990s.<ref>Eugene M. Avrutin, ed. ''Photographing the Jewish Nation: Pictures from S. An-sky's Ethnographic Expeditions''. Tauber Institute for the Study of European Jewry. Waltham, Mass.: Brandeis, 2009.</ref>  The State Ethnographic Museum at St. Petersburg holds a good deal of it.<ref name=Tracing>Tracing An-sky: Jewish Collections from the State Ethnographic Museum in St. Petersburg, Amsterdam 1992</ref> Some of his vast collection of cylinder recordings made on these expeditions have been transferred to CD as well.<ref name=Wax>Materials of J. Engel Ethnographic Expedition 1912 (The Historic Collection of Jewish Music 1912-1947, vol. 1) (Kiev:  National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine;  Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine; Institute for Information Recording, 2001)</ref>

His ethnographic report of the deliberate destruction of Jewish communities by the Russian army in the First World War, ''The Enemy at His Pleasure: A Journey Through the Jewish Pale of Settlement During World War I,''  has become a major source in the historiography of the war's impact on civilian populations.<ref>Ansky (An-ski), S.

==Literary career==
[[File:Mauzoleum Trzech Pisarzy 4.JPG|thumb|Mausoleum of the Three Writers (Peretz, Dinezon, and Ansky) in Warsaw]]
Initially he wrote in [[Russian language|Russian]], but from 1904 he became known mainly as a [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] author.

He is best known for his play ''[[The Dybbuk]]'' or ''Between Two Worlds'', written in 1914. The play was first staged in the Elyseum Theatre in [[Warsaw]], on December 9, 1920, one month (at the end of the 30-day mourning period) after the author's death.<ref>Zylbercweig, Zalmen (ed.). "[https://archive.org/stream/nybc201089#page/n52/mode/1up An-ski, Sh.]", in ''Leksikon fun Yidishn Teater'' (Lexicon of Yiddish Theater). Vol. 1. New York: Elisheva, 1931. col. 71-78; here: 74.</ref> It was subsequently translated into a dozen or more languages and performed thousands of times all over the world. It is still being produced, along with numerous adaptations, as well as operas, ballets, and symphonic suites. (For example, in 2011 there were seven different productions.) It is considered the jewel of the Jewish theatre.<ref>1. Fernando Peñalosa, ''The Dybbuk: Text, Subtext, and Context''. Tsiterboym Books, 2012.</ref> In the early years ''The Dybbuk'' was considered so significant that parodies of it were written and produced.<ref>Fernando Peñalosa, tr., ''Parodies of An-sky’s The Dybbuk. Bilingual Edition''. Tsiterboym Books, 2012.</ref>

Although ''The Dybbuk'' is Ansky’s best-known work, he published an impressive number of works of literature, politics and ethnography. His ''Collected Works'', which do not include all his writings, comprise fifteen volumes.<ref>S. An-sky. ''Gezamelte Shriften''. Vilna, Warsaw, New York: Wydawnistwo “AN-SKI,” 1922. Reprinted 1926 and 1929.</ref> An-sky wrote a number of other plays, four of which are included in this collection, long out of print. One (''Day and Night'') is,  like ''The Dybbuk'', a Hasidic Gothic story. The other three plays have revolutionary themes, and were originally written in Russian: ''Father and Son'', ''In a Conspiratorial Apartment'', and ''The Grandfather''. All four  have recently been republished in a bilingual Yiddish-English edition.<ref>''S. An-sky. Four Plays. Bilingual  Edition,'' tr. Fernando Peñalosa. Tsiterboym Books, 2013.</ref>

Ansky was also the author of the song ''[[Di Shvue]]'' (The Oath), which became the anthem of the Jewish Socialist [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]] party. He was the author of the poem (later made into a song) "[[In Zaltsikn Yam]]" (In the Salty Sea), which was dedicated to the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Poland|Bund]] as well.
