'''Jane Martin''' is the [[pen name]] of a playwright who has been active from 1981 to the present, whose real identity remains unknown. Martin's plays include ''Anton in Show Business'', ''Back Story'', ''Beauty'', ''Coup/Clucks'', ''[[Cementville]]'', ''Criminal Hearts'', ''[[Flaming Guns of the Purple Sage]]'', ''Vital Signs'', ''[[Keely and Du]]'' and ''[[Talking With...]]''<ref>[http://www.doollee.com/PlaywrightsM/martin-jane.html "Jane Martin," Playwrights Database]</ref>

Martin's ''Keely and Du'' won the 1994 American Theater Critics Association New Play Award<ref>[http://www.playbill.com/article/jane-martins-jack-jill-takes-us-critics-honors-com-70061 Jane Martin's Jack & Jill Takes US Critics' Honors]</ref> and was a finalist for the 1994 [[Pulitzer Prize]].<ref>[http://www.pulitzer.org/finalists/jane-martin Finalist: Keely and Du, by Jane Martin (a pseudonym)]</ref>

Martin has been a longtime collaborator of former [[Actors Theatre of Louisville]] artistic director [[Jon Jory]], who has directed the premieres of all of Martin's plays and serves as Martin's occasional spokesman. For this reason, Martin is often speculated to be Jory himself, or a collaboration between Jory and his wife, playwright Marcia Dixcy.<ref name="two decade">[http://www.hartnell.cc.ca.us/westernstage/press_releases/Anton/antonarticle.htm "A Two Decade Old Mystery: Who is Jane Martin?"]</ref><ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1072179 NPR - ''Who is Jane Martin?'']</ref> Jory has refused to divulge any information about Martin, other than that they are a native of [[Kentucky]], and that "whoever writes these plays feels that they would be unable to write them" if their identity were revealed.<ref name="two decade" />

Other theories about Martin's identity include former Actors Theatre of Louisville executive director Alexander Speer, former Actors Theatre literary manager Michael Bigelow Dixon, and former intern Kyle John Schmidt.
