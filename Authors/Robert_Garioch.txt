'''Robert Garioch Sutherland''' (9 May 1909 &ndash; 26 April 1981) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[poet]] and [[translator]]. His poetry was written almost exclusively in the [[Scots language]], he was a key member in the literary revival of the language in the mid-20th century. However, his biggest influences were the 18th-century poet [[Robert Fergusson]] and the [[Italy|Italian]] [[dialect]] sonneteer [[Giuseppe Gioachino Belli]].

== Life ==
Garioch was born in [[Edinburgh]], the son of a decorator and a music teacher, and attended the [[Royal High School (Edinburgh)|Royal High School]] before going to the [[University of Edinburgh]]. He was [[Conscription|conscripted]] into the [[Royal Corps of Signals]] in 1941, and married early the following year. However, whilst serving in [[Operation Torch]] in North Africa, Garioch was captured by [[Germany|German]] troops in November 1942 and spent the following three years as a [[Prisoner of War]].

After Garioch returned to the [[United Kingdom]] in 1945 he became a teacher, a job he held until taking early retirement in 1964. Following his retirement he worked on a number of Scottish literary magazines, most notably ''Scottish International''. He also spent a number of years in the 1970s as writer-in-residence at the University of Edinburgh.

==Works==
Experience as a POW had a significant impact on Garioch's career, and he provides a vivid account of those years in his autobiographical ''Two Men and a Blanket'' (1975). While interned in Italy, he learnt the language sufficiently well to read also authors who wrote in a variety of native dialects.

Unlike many of his contemporaries, Garioch wrote very little poetry concerning his war experiences. Instead he focussed primarily on social causes and the plight of the 'wee man', a fact that may account for his enduring popularity (particularly on the readings circuit). These facts, however, have distracted many critics from his extraordinary technical skill and the responsible scholarship of his handling of the Scots language, in which he surpasses all his contemporaries and even his great predecessor [[Hugh MacDiarmid]] (of whom he became critical). And there are weightier poems, such as 'The Wire', 'The Muir' or 'The Big Music', which entirely contradict the cosy persona which he sometimes adopted, and which is more often projected onto him. Aside from his original compositions, Garioch also translated a number of works by other poets into Scots. He translated a large number of poems from Roman dialect by Giuseppe Gioachino Belli, who was a massive influence on his own poetry, as well as two plays by [[George Buchanan (humanist)|George Buchanan]] (which were originally written in [[Latin]]). He also rendered [[Pindar]] and [[Hesiod]] into Scots.

Robert Garioch is commemorated in [[Makars' Court]], outside [[The Writers' Museum]], [[Lawnmarket]], Edinburgh. Selections for Makars' Court are made by [[The Writers' Museum]]; [[The Saltire Society]]; [[The Scottish Poetry Library]].
