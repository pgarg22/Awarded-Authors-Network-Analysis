'''Enoch Arnold Bennett''' (27 May 1867 – 27 March 1931) was an English author, best known as a novelist. He was a prolific writer: between the start of his career in 1898 and his death he completed 34 novels, seven volumes of short stories, 13 plays (some in collaboration with other writers), and a daily journal totalling more than a million words. He wrote articles and stories for more than 100 different newspapers and periodicals, worked in and briefly ran the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] in the [[First World War]], and wrote for the cinema in the 1920s. The sales of his books were substantial, and he was the most financially successful British author of his day.

Born into a modest but upwardly-mobile family in [[Hanley, Staffordshire|Hanley]], in the [[Staffordshire Potteries]], Bennett was intended by his father, a [[solicitor]], to follow him into the legal profession. Bennett worked for his father, before moving to another law firm in London as a clerk, aged 21. He became assistant editor and then editor of a women's magazine, before becoming a full-time author in 1900. Always a devotee of French culture in general and French literature in particular, he moved to Paris in 1902, where the relaxed milieu helped him overcome his intense shyness, particularly with women. He spent ten years in France, marrying a Frenchwoman in 1907. In 1912 he moved back to England. He and his wife separated in 1921 and he spent the last years of his life with a new partner, an English actress. He died in 1931 of [[typhoid fever]], having unwisely drunk tap water in France.

Bennett is best known for his novels and short stories, many of which are set in a fictionalised version of the Potteries, which he called The Five Towns. He strongly believed that literature should be accessible to ordinary people, and he deplored literary cliques and élites. His books appealed to a wide public and sold in large numbers. For this reason writers and supporters of the [[literary modernism|modernist]] school, notably [[Virginia Woolf]], belittled him, and his work became neglected after his death. Bennett was also a playwright; he did less well in the theatre than with novels, but achieved two considerable successes with ''[[Milestones (play)|Milestones]]'' (1912) and ''[[The Great Adventure (play)|The Great Adventure]]'' (1913). He also had considerable success with journalistic 'self-help' books such as ''[[How to Live on 24 Hours a Day]]'' (1908) and ''[[Literary Taste: How to Form It]]'' (1909).

Studies by [[Margaret Drabble]] (1974), [[John Carey (critic)|John Carey]] (1992) and others have led to a re-evaluation of Bennett's work. His finest novels, including ''[[Anna of the Five Towns]]'' (1902), ''[[The Old Wives' Tale]]'' (1908), ''[[The Clayhanger Family#Clayhanger (1910)|Clayhanger]]'' (1910) and ''[[Riceyman Steps]]'' (1923), are now widely recognised as major works.

Enoch Bennett's early career had been one of mixed fortunes: after an unsuccessful attempt to run a business making and selling pottery, he set up as a draper and pawnbroker in 1866. Four years later his father died, leaving him some money, with which he [[articled clerk|articled]] himself to a local law firm; in 1876 he qualified as a [[solicitor]].<ref name=odnb>Lucas, John.

Enoch Bennett had an authoritarian side, but it was a happy household,<ref>Drabble, pp. 41–42</ref> although a mobile one: as Enoch's success as a solicitor increased, the family moved, within the space of five years, to four different houses in Hanley and the neighbouring [[Burslem]].<ref name=oglb/>

From 1877 to 1882 Bennett's schooling was at the [[Wedgwood Institute]], Burslem, followed by a year at a [[grammar school]] in [[Newcastle-under-Lyme]]. He was good at Latin and better at French;<ref>Swinnerton (1950), p. 10</ref> he had an inspirational headmaster who gave him a love for French literature and the French language that lasted all his life.<ref>Drabble, p. 38</ref> He did well academically and passed [[Cambridge University]] examinations that could have led to his becoming an [[undergraduate]], but his father had other plans. In 1883, aged 16, Bennett left school and began work – unpaid – in his father's office. He divided his time between uncongenial jobs, such as rent collecting, during the day, and studying for examinations in the evening. He began writing in a modest way, contributing light pieces to the local newspaper.<ref name=odnb/> He became adept in [[Pitman's shorthand]], a skill much sought after in commercial offices,<ref>Pound, p. 68</ref> and on the strength of that he secured a post as a clerk at a firm of solicitors in [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]], London.<ref>Pound, p. 71</ref> In 1891, aged 21, he left for London and never returned to live in his native county.<ref>Swinnerton (1954), p. 5</ref>[[File:Western side of Lincoln's Inn Fields.jpg|thumb|alt=urban streetscape with trees and grassed area to one side and terraced 18th century buildings on the other|upright=1|Lincoln's Inn Fields in 2018]]

===First years in London===
In the solicitors' office in London, Bennett became friendly with a young colleague, John Eland, who had a passion for books. Eland's friendship helped alleviate Bennett's innate shyness, which was exacerbated by a lifelong stammer.<ref name=odnb/>{{refn|[[Somerset Maugham]], a friend of Bennett and a fellow-stammerer, observed, "It was painful to watch the struggle he sometimes had to get the words out. It was torture to him. Few realised the exhaustion it caused him to speak. What to most men is as easy as breathing was to him a constant strain.&nbsp;... Few knew the distressing sense it gave rise to of a bar to complete contact with other men. It may be that except for the stammer which forced him to introspection Arnold would never have become a writer".<ref>Maugham, p. 192</ref>|group=n}} Together they explored the world of literature. Among the writers who impressed and influenced Bennett were [[George Moore (novelist)|George Moore]], [[Émile Zola]], [[Honoré de Balzac]], [[Guy de Maupassant]], [[Gustave Flaubert]] and [[Ivan Turgenev]].<ref>Young, p. 8</ref> He continued his own writing, and won a prize of twenty [[Guinea (coin)|guineas]] for a contribution to a magazine, and when ''[[Tit-Bits]]'' rejected a short story he submitted it successfully to ''[[The Yellow Book]]'', where it featured alongside contributions from [[Henry James]] and other well-known writers.<ref>Young, p. 9</ref>

In 1894 Bennett resigned from the law firm and became assistant editor of the magazine ''Woman''. The salary, £150 a year, was £50 less than he was earning as a clerk,{{refn|£150 in 1894 is approximately {{Inflation|UK|150|1894|fmt=eq|cursign=£|r=-3}}, according to calculations based on [[Consumer Price Index (United Kingdom)|Consumer Price Index]] measure of inflation.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Gregory|title=The Annual RPI and Average Earnings for Britain, 1209 to Present (New Series)|url=https://www.measuringworth.com/ukearncpi/|access-date=4 June 2020|publisher=MeasuringWorth|date=2020|archive-date=17 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171217054349/https://measuringworth.com/ukearncpi/|url-status=live}}</ref>|group=n}} but the post left him much more free time to write his first novel. For the magazine he wrote under a range of female pen-names such as "Gwendolen" and "Cecile". As his biographer [[Margaret Drabble]] puts it:
{{blockindent|He did a bit of everything. He learned about recipes and [[layette]]s, about making-up, making-ready and running-round. He reviewed plays and books&nbsp;... He acquainted himself with hundreds of subjects that would never have come his way otherwise&nbsp;... the domestic column told one "How to train a Cook", "How to keep parsley fresh", "How to make money at home", "How to bath the baby (Part One)". The knowledge was not wasted, for Bennett is one of the few novelists who can write with sympathy and detail about the domestic preoccupations of women.<ref>Drabble, p. 56</ref>|}}
The informal office life of the magazine suited Bennett, not least because it brought him into lively female company, and he began to be a little more relaxed with young women.<ref>Drabble, p. 57</ref> He continued work on his novel and wrote short stories and articles. He was clear-eyed about his literary talent: he wrote to a friend, "I have no inward assurance that I could ever do anything more than mediocre viewed strictly as art – very mediocre" but he knew he could "turn out things which would be read with zest, & about which the man in the street would say to friends 'Have you read so & so in the What-is-it?{{'}}"<ref>Hepburn (2013), p. 11</ref> He was happy to write for popular journals like ''Hearth and Home'' or for the highbrow ''[[The Academy (periodical)|The Academy]]''.<ref>Drabble, p. 59</ref>

His debut novel, ''A Man from the North'', completed in 1896, was published two years later, by [[John Lane (publisher)|John Lane]], whose reader, [[John Buchan]], recommended it for publication.<ref>Drabble, p. 66</ref> It elicited a letter of praise from [[Joseph Conrad]] and was well and widely reviewed, but Bennett's profits from the sale of the book were less than the cost of having it typed.<ref>Young, p. 9; and Drabble, p. 78</ref>

In 1896 Bennett was promoted to be editor of ''Woman''; by then he had set his sights on a career as a full-time author, but he served as editor for four years.<ref name=odnb/> During that time he wrote two popular books, described by the critic [[John Lucas (poet)|John Lucas]] as "[[potboilers|pot-boilers]]": ''Journalism for Women'' (1898) and ''Polite Farces for the Drawing Room'' (1899). He also began work on a second novel, ''[[Anna of the Five Towns]]'', the five towns being Bennett's lightly fictionalised version of the [[Staffordshire Potteries]] (The Potteries in fact comprise six towns - Stoke, Hanley, Longton, Burslem and Tunstall - but Bennett said that he believed "Five Towns" was more euphonious than "Six Towns", so he omitted Fenton).<ref name=ocel>Birch, Dinah (ed).

===Freelance; Paris===
In 1900 Bennett resigned his post at ''Woman'', and left London to set up house at Trinity Hall Farm, near the village of [[Hockliffe]] in Bedfordshire, where he made a home not only for himself but for his parents and younger sister. He completed ''Anna of the Five Towns'' in 1901; it was published the following year, as was its successor, ''[[The Grand Babylon Hotel]]''. The latter, an extravagant story of crime in high society, sold 50,000 copies in hardback and was almost immediately translated into four languages.<ref>Carey, p. 153</ref> By this stage he was confident enough in his abilities to tell a friend:
{{blockindent|Although I am 33 & I have not made a name, I infallibly know that I shall make a name, & that soon. But I should like to be a legend. I think I have settled in my own mind that my work will never be better than third rate, judged by the high standards, but I shall be cunning enough to make it impose on my contemporaries.<ref>Bennett and Hepburn, p. 151</ref>|}}
[[File:26 rue dAumale Paris.jpg|thumb|left|alt=exterior of 19th-century Parisian appartement block|upright|Rue d'Aumale, Bennett's second address in Paris]]

In January 1902 Enoch Bennett died, after a decline into dementia.<ref>Drabble, pp. 88–89</ref> His widow chose to move back to Burslem and Bennett's sister married shortly afterwards. With no dependants, Bennett decided to move to Paris, where he took up residence in March 1902.<ref name="Drabble, p. 104">Drabble, p. 104</ref> His reasons for doing so are not clear. Drabble speculates that perhaps "he was hoping for some kind of liberation. He was thirty-five and unmarried";<ref name="Drabble, p. 104"/> Lucas writes that it was almost certainly Bennett's desire to be recognised as a serious artist that prompted his move;<ref name=odnb/> according to his friend and colleague [[Frank Swinnerton]], Bennett was following in the footsteps of George Moore by going to live in "the home of modern realism";<ref name=s14>Swinnerton (1950), p. 14</ref> in the view of the biographer [[Reginald Pound]] it was "to begin his career as a man of the world".<ref>Pound, p. 127</ref>  The [[9th arrondissement of Paris]] was Bennett's home for the next five years, first in the rue de Calais, near the [[Place Pigalle]], and then the more upmarket rue d'Aumale.<ref>Drabble, pp. 109 and 150; and Pound, p. 156</ref>

Life in Paris evidently helped Bennett overcome much of his remaining shyness with women. His journals for his early months in Paris mention a young woman identified as "C" or "Chichi", who was a [[chorus line|chorus girl]];<ref>Bennett (1954), pp. 71–72, 76, 81 and 84–86</ref> the journals – or at least the cautiously selected extracts published since his death<ref name=lhd/> – do not record the precise nature of the relationship, but the two spent a considerable amount of time together.<ref>Pound, pp. 128–129; and Drabble, pp. 10, and 105–106</ref>

In a restaurant where he dined frequently a trivial incident in 1903 gave Bennett the germ of an idea for the novel generally regarded as his masterpiece.<ref name=s14/><ref>Sutherland, John.

In 1905 Bennett became engaged to Eleanor Green, a member of an eccentric and unreliable American family living in Paris, but at the last moment, after the wedding invitations had been sent out, she broke off the engagement and almost immediately married a fellow American.<ref>Pound, p. 163; and Drabble, p. 129</ref> Drabble comments that Bennett was well rid of her, but it was a painful episode in his life.<ref>Drabble, p. 133</ref> In early 1907 he met Marguerite Soulié (1874–1960), who soon became first a friend and then a lover.<ref>Drabble, p. 137</ref> In May he was taken ill with a severe gastric complaint, and Marguerite moved into his flat to look after him.

Lucas comments that the best of the novels written while in France – ''Whom God Hath Joined'' (1906), ''The Old Wives' Tale'' (1908), and ''[[Clayhanger]]'' (1910) – "justly established Bennett as a major exponent of realistic fiction".<ref name=odnb/> In addition to these, Bennett published lighter novels such as ''[[The Card]]'' (1911). His output of literary journalism included articles for [[T. P. O'Connor]]'s ''T. P.'s Weekly'' and the left-wing ''[[The New Age]]''; his pieces for the latter, published under a pen-name, were concise literary essays aimed at "the general cultivated reader",<ref name=odnb/> a form taken up by a later generation of writers including [[J. B. Priestley]] and [[V. S. Pritchett]].<ref name=odnb/>

In 1911 Bennett made a financially rewarding visit to the US, which he later recorded in his 1912 book ''Those United States''. While there he sold the serial rights of his forthcoming novel, ''The Price of Love'' (1913–14), to ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harpers]]'' for £2,000, eight essays to ''[[Metropolitan Magazine (New York City)|Metropolitan]]'' for a total of  £1,200, and the American rights of a successor to ''Clayhanger'' for £3,000.<ref name=odnb/> During his ten years in France he had gone from a moderately well-known writer enjoying modest sales to outstanding success.

Bennett's attitude to the [[First World War]] was that British politicians had been at fault in failing to prevent it, but that once it had become inevitable it was right that Britain should join its allies against the Germans.<ref>Pound, p. 248</ref> He turned his attention from writing plays and novels to his journalism, aiming to inform and encourage the public in Britain and allied and neutral countries. He served on official and unofficial committees, and in 1915 he was invited to visit France to see conditions at the front and write about them for readers at home.

From the outset, Bennett believed in the "democratisation of art which it is surely the duty of the minority to undertake".<ref>Bennett, 1901, p. 5</ref> He admired some of the [[Literary modernism|modernist]] writers of his time, but strongly disapproved of their conscious appeal to a small élite and their disdain for the general reader. Bennett believed that literature should be inclusive, accessible by ordinary people.<ref name=kk>Koenigsberger, Kurt.

From the start of his career, Bennett was aware of the appeal of regional fiction. [[Anthony Trollope]], [[George Eliot]] and [[Thomas Hardy]] had created and sustained their own locales, and Bennett did the same with his Five Towns, drawing on his experiences as a boy and young man.<ref>Howarth, p. 76</ref> As a [[Naturalism (literature)|realistic]] writer he followed the examples of the authors he admired – above all [[George Moore (novelist)|George Moore]], but also [[Honoré de Balzac|Balzac]], [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]] and [[Guy de Maupassant|Maupassant]] among French writers, and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky]], [[Ivan Turgenev|Turgenev]] and [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] among Russians. In writing about the Five Towns Bennett aimed to portray the experiences of ordinary people coping with the norms and constraints of the communities in which they lived.<ref>Howarth, pp. 13 and 76</ref> [[J. B. Priestley]] considered that the next influence on Bennett's fiction was his time in London in the 1890s, "engaged in journalism and ingenious pot-boiling of various kinds".<ref name=jpb>''Quoted'' in Howarth, pp. 11–12</ref>

===Novels and short stories===

Bennett is remembered chiefly for his novels and short stories. The best known are set in, or feature people from, the six towns of the Potteries of his youth. He presented the region as "the Five Towns", which correspond closely with their originals: the real-life [[Burslem]], [[Hanley, Staffordshire|Hanley]], [[Longton, Staffordshire|Longton]], [[Stoke-upon-Trent|Stoke]] and [[Tunstall, Staffordshire|Tunstall]] become Bennett's Bursley, Hanbridge, Longshaw, Knype and Turnhill.<ref>Drabble, p. 4</ref>{{refn|The omitted town is [[Fenton, Staffordshire|Fenton]], an omission that still rankles with some local people in the 21st century.<ref>Ault, Richard.

Many of his characters are discernibly based on real people in his life. His Lincoln's Inn friend John Eland was the source for Mr Aked in Bennett's first novel, ''A Man from the North'' (1898);<ref>Drabble, p. 49</ref> ''A Great Man'' (1903) contains a character with echoes of his Parisienne friend Chichi;<ref>Drabble, p. 115</ref>  Darius Clayhanger's early life is based on that of a family friend and Bennett himself is seen in Edwin in ''Clayhanger''.<ref>Drabble, pp. 53 and 174–175</ref> He has been criticised for making literary use in that novel of the distressing details of his father's decline into senility, but in Pound's view, in committing the details to paper Bennett was unburdening himself of painful memories.<ref>Pound, p. 121</ref> 

''These Twain'' is Bennett’s “last extended study of Five Towns life”.<ref>Lucas, p. 153</ref> The novels he wrote in the 1920s are largely set in London and thereabouts: ''[[Riceyman Steps]]'' (1923), for instance, generally regarded as the best of Bennett’s post-war novels<ref>Drabble, p. 276</ref> was set in Clerkenwell: it was awarded the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize|James Tait Black]] novel prize for 1923, "the first prize for a book I ever had," Bennett noted in his journal on 18 October 1924.<ref>Bennett (1933), p. 63</ref> His ''Lord Raingo'' (1926), described by Dudley Barker as “one of the finest of political novels in the language”,<ref>Barker, p. 224</ref> benefited from Bennett’s own experience in the Ministry of Information and his subsequent friendship with Beaverbrook:<ref>Drabble, p. 300</ref> John Lucas states that “As a study of what goes on in the corridors of power [''Lord Raingo''] has few equals”.<ref>Lucas, p. 305</ref> And Bennett’s final – and longest – novel, ''[[Imperial Palace (novel)|Imperial Palace]]'' (1930), is set in a grand London hotel reminiscent of the [[Savoy Hotel|Savoy]], whose directors assisted him in his preliminary research.<ref>Pound, p. 336</ref> 

Bennett usually gave his novels subtitles; the most frequent was "A fantasia on modern themes",{{refn|There were six "Fantasias": ''The Grand Babylon Hotel'' (1902); ''Teresa of Watling Street'' (1904); ''Hugo'' (1906); ''The Ghost'' (1907); ''The City of Pleasure'' (1907) and ''The Vanguard'' (1927).<ref name=ww>Watson and Willison, columns 429–431</ref>|group=n}} individual books were called "A frolic" or "A melodrama", but he was sparing with the label "A novel" which he used for only a few of his books – for instance ''Anna of the Five Towns'', ''Leonora'', ''Sacred and Profane Love'', ''The Old Wives' Tale'', ''The Pretty Lady'' (1918) and ''Riceyman Steps''.<ref name="ww" />

Literary critics have followed Bennett in dividing his novels into groups. The literary scholar Kurt Koenigsberger proposes three categories. In the first are the long narratives – "freestanding, monumental artefacts" – ''Anna of the Five Towns'', ''The Old Wives' Tale'', ''Clayhanger'' (1910), and ''Riceyman Steps'', which "have been held in high critical regard since their publication".<ref name="kk" /> Koenigsberger writes that the "Fantasias" such as ''The Grand Babylon Hotel'' (1902), ''Teresa of Watling Street'' (1904), and ''The City of Pleasure'' (1907), have "mostly passed from public attention along with the 'modern' conditions they exploit".<ref name="kk" /> His third group includes "Idyllic Diversions" or "Stories of Adventure", including ''Helen with the High Hand'' (1910), ''The Card'' (1911), and ''The Regent'' (1913), which "have sustained some enduring critical and popular interest, not least for their amusing treatment of cosmopolitanism and provinciality".<ref name="kk" />

Bennett published 96 short stories in seven volumes between 1905 and 1931. His ambivalence about his native town is vividly seen in "The Death of Simon Fuge" in the collection ''The Grim Smile of the Five Towns'' (1907), judged by Lucas the finest of all the stories.<ref name=odnb/> His chosen locations ranged widely, including Paris and Venice as well as London and the Five Towns.<ref name=ww/> As with his novels, he would sometimes give a story a label, calling "The Matador of the Five Towns" (1912) "a tragedy" and "Jock-at-a-Venture" from the same collection "a frolic".<ref name=ww/> The short stories, particularly those in  ''Tales of the Five Towns'' (1905), ''The Grim Smile of the Five Towns'' (1907), and ''The Matador of the Five Towns'' contain some of the most striking examples of Bennett's concern for realism, with an unflinching narrative focus on what Lucas calls "the drab, the squalid, and the mundane".<ref name=odnb/>

In 2010 and 2011 two further volumes of Bennett's hitherto uncollected short stories were published: they range from his earliest work written in the 1890s, some under the pseudonym Sarah Volatile, to US magazine commissions from the late 1920s.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bennett|first=Arnold|title=Arnold Bennett's Uncollected Short Stories|editor= John Shapcott|location=Leek|publisher=Churnet Valley Books|year=2010|isbn=978-1-90-454674-0}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Bennett|first=Arnold|title=Lord Dover and Other Lost Stories|editor=John Shapcott|publisher=Churnet Valley Books|year=2011|isbn=978-1-90-454681-8|location=Leek}}</ref>

===Stage and screen===
In 1931 the critic Graham Sutton, looking back at Bennett's career in the theatre, contrasted his achievements as a playwright with those as a novelist, suggesting that Bennett was a complete novelist but a not-entirely-complete dramatist. His plays were clearly those of a novelist: "He tends to lengthy speeches. Sometimes he overwrites a part, as though distrusting the actor. He is more interested in what his people are than in what they visibly do. He 'thinks nowt' of mere slickness of plot."<ref name=sutton>Sutton, Graham. "The Plays of Arnold Bennett", ''The Bookman'', December 1931, p. 165</ref>
[[File:Arnold Bennett The Great Adventure 1913.png|thumb|upright=1.5|left|alt=Scene from a play, with young woman standing in a smart drawing room addressing several seated men|''The Great Adventure'', 1913]]

Bennett's lack of a theatrical grounding showed in the uneven construction of some of his plays. A successful first act followed by much weaker second and third acts was noted in his 1911 comedy ''The Honeymoon'', which played for 125 performances from October 1911.<ref>Wearing, p. 175</ref> The highly successful ''Milestones'' was seen as impeccably constructed, but the credit for that was given to his craftsmanlike collaborator, Edward Knoblauch (Bennett being credited with the inventive flair of the piece).<ref name=da/> By far his most successful solo effort in the theatre was ''The Great Adventure'', based on his 1908 novel ''[[Buried Alive (novel)|Buried Alive]]'', which ran in the West End for 674 performances, from March 1913 to November 1914.<ref>Wearing, p. 327</ref> Sutton praised its "new strain of impish and sardonic fantasy" and rated it a much finer play than ''Milestones''.<ref name=sutton/>

After the First World War Bennett wrote two plays on metaphysical questions, ''Sacred and Profane Love'' (1919, adapted from his novel) and ''Body and Soul'' (1922), which made little impression. ''[[Saturday Review (London newspaper)|The Saturday Review]]'' praised the "shrewd wit" of the former, but thought it "false in its essentials&nbsp;... superficial in its accidentals".<ref>"Mr Arnold Bennett at the Aldwych", ''The Saturday Review'', 22 November 1919, p. 483</ref> Of the latter, the critic Horace Shipp wondered "how the author of ''Clayhanger'' and ''The Old Wives' Tale'' could write such third-rate stuff".<ref>Shipp, Horace. "Body and Soul: A Study in Theatre Problems", ''The English Review'', October 1922, p. 340</ref> Bennett had more success in a final collaboration with [[Edward Knoblock]] (as Knoblauch had become during the war) with ''Mr Prohack'' (1927), a comedy based on his 1922 novel; one critic wrote "I could have enjoyed the play had it run to double its length", but even so he judged the middle act weaker than the outer two.<ref>Walbrook, H. M. "Plays of the Month", ''The Play Pictorial'', November 1927, p. 10</ref> Sutton concludes that Bennett's ''forte'' was character, but that the competence of his technique was variable.<ref name=sutton/> The plays are seldom revived, although some have been adapted for television.<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/search/0/20?adv=1&media=tv&order=asc&q=Arnold+Bennett "Arnold Bennett"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210312093028/https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/search/0/20?adv=1&media=tv&order=asc&q=Arnold+Bennett |date=12 March 2021 }} BBC Genome.

"Don Juan de Mañara", ''The Sphere, 3 July 1937</ref> The critic [[Ernest Newman]] defended both works, finding Bennett's libretto for Judith "a drama told simply and straightforwardly"<ref>Rosen, p. 122</ref> and ''Don Juan'' "the best thing that English opera has so far produced … the most dramatic and stageworthy",<ref>''Quoted'' in ''The Cincinnati Enquirer'',  15 July 1937, p. 8</ref> but though politely received, both operas vanished from the repertory after a few performances.<ref>Rosen, p. 202</ref>

Bennett took a keen interest in  the cinema, and in 1920 wrote ''The Wedding Dress'', a scenario for a silent  movie, at the request of Jesse Lasky of the [[Famous Players-Lasky|Famous  Players]] film company.<ref>Drabble, pp. 266, 268-9</ref> It was never made, though Bennett wrote a full-length treatment, assumed to be lost until his daughter Virginia found it in a drawer in her Paris home in 1983; subsequently the script was sold to the [[Potteries Museum and Art Gallery]] and was finally published in 2013.<ref>Shapcott, pp. 263–264 </ref>

In 1928 Bennett wrote the  scenario for the silent film ''[[Piccadilly (film)|Piccadilly]]'', directed by [[E. A.

Inspired by those of the [[Goncourt brothers]], Bennett kept a journal throughout his adult life. Swinnerton says that it runs to a million words; it has not been published in full.<ref>Swinnerton (1954), p. 15</ref> Edited extracts were issued in three volumes, in 1932 and 1933.<ref name=ww/> According to Hugh Walpole, the editor, [[Newman Flower]], "was so appalled by much of what he found in the journals that he published only brief extracts, and those the safest".<ref name=lhd>Lyttelton and Hart-Davis, p. 176</ref> Whatever Flower censored, the extracts he selected were not always "the safest": he let some defamatory remarks through, and in 1935 he, the publishers and printers had to pay an undisclosed sum to the plaintiff in one libel suit and £2,500 in another.<ref>"Journals of Arnold Bennett: Libel Action Settled" ''The Times'', 18 April 1935, p. 4; and "High Court of Justice", ''The Times'', 23 November 1935, p. 4</ref>

Wells]] and [[John Galsworthy]].<ref name=h5/><ref>Steele, p. 21</ref> Of the three, Bennett drew the most opprobrium from modernists such as [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Ezra Pound]] and [[Wyndham Lewis]] who regarded him as representative of an outmoded and rival literary culture.<ref name=h5>Howarth, p. 5; and Drabble p. 289</ref> There was a strong element of class-consciousness and snobbery in the modernists' attitude:<ref>Carey, p. 162</ref> Woolf accused Bennett of having "a shopkeeper's view of literature" and in her essay "[[Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown|Mr Bennett and Mrs Brown]]" accused Bennett, Galsworthy and Wells of ushering in an "age when character disappeared or was mysteriously engulfed".<ref>Bishop, p. 137</ref>

In a 1963 study of Bennett, James Hepburn summed up and dissented from the prevailing views of the novels, listing three related evaluative positions taken individually or together by almost all Bennett's critics: that his Five Towns novels are generally superior to his other work, that he and his art declined after ''The Old Wives' Tale'' or ''Clayhanger'', and that there is a sharp and clear distinction between the good and bad novels.<ref>Hepburn (1963), p. 182</ref> Hepburn countered that one of the novels most frequently praised by literary critics is ''Riceyman Steps'' (1923) set in [[Clerkenwell]], London, and dealing with material imagined rather than observed by the author.<ref>Hepburn (1963), p. 183</ref>{{refn|''Riceyman Steps'' won the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for fiction in 1923: winners in other years have included [[D.

"sentimental melodrama" to "a great novel".<ref>Hepburn (1963), pp. 132–133</ref> Lucas (2004) considers it "a much underrated study of England during the war years, especially in its sensitive feeling for the destructive frenzy that underlay much apparently good-hearted patriotism".<ref name=odnb/>

In 1974 [[Margaret Drabble]] published ''Arnold Bennett'', a literary biography. In the foreword she demurred at the critical dismissal of Bennett:

{{blockindent|I'd been brought up to believe that even his best books weren't very good – [[F. R. Leavis|Leavis]] dismisses him in a sentence or two, and not many people seemed to take him as seriously as I did.

Writing in the 1990s the literary critic [[John Carey (critic)|John Carey]] called for a reappraisal of Bennett in his book ''The Intellectuals and the Masses'' (1992):
{{blockindent|His writings represent a systematic dismemberment of the intellectuals' case against the masses. He has never been popular with intellectuals as a result. Despite Margaret Drabble's forceful advocacy, his novels are still undervalued by literary academics, syllabus-devisers and other official censors.<ref>Carey, p. 152</ref>|}}
In 2006 Koenigsberger commented that one reason why Bennett's novels had been sidelined, apart from "the exponents of modernism who recoiled from his democratising aesthetic programme", was his attitude to gender. His books include the pronouncements "the average man has more intellectual power than the average woman" and "women as a sex love to be dominated"; Koenigsberger nevertheless praises Bennett's "sensitive and oft-praised portrayals of female figures in his fiction".<ref name=kk/>

Lucas concludes his study with the comment that Bennett's realism may be limited by his cautious assumption that things are as they are and will not change. Nevertheless, in Lucas's view, successive generations of reader have admired Bennett's best work, and future generations are certain to do so.<ref name=odnb/>

===Crime fiction===

Bennett dabbled in crime fiction, in ''The Grand Babylon Hotel'' and ''The Loot of Cities'' (1905). In ''Queen's Quorum'' (1951), a survey of crime fiction, [[Ellery Queen]] listed the latter among the 100 most important works in the genre. This collection of stories recounts the adventures of a millionaire who commits crimes to achieve his idealistic ends. Although it was "one of his least known works," it was nevertheless "of unusual interest, both as an example of Arnold Bennett's early work and as an early example of dilettante detectivism".<ref>Queen, p. 50</ref>

===Arnold Bennett Society===

The Society was founded in 1954 "to promote the study and appreciation of the life, works and times not only of Arnold Bennett himself but also of other provincial writers, with particular relationship to North Staffordshire". In 2021 its president was Denis Eldin, Bennett's grandson; among the vice-presidents was Margaret Drabble.<ref>[https://www.arnoldbennettsociety.org.uk/meet-the-team/ "Meet the Team"], Arnold Bennett Society. Retrieved 25 June 2021</ref>

In 2017 the society instituted an annual Arnold Bennett Prize as part of author's 150th anniversary celebrations, to be awarded to an author who was born, lives or works in North Staffordshire and has published a book in the relevant year, or to the author of a book which features the region. In 2017 the award was won by [[John Lancaster (writer)|John Lancaster]] for his poetry collection ''Potters: A Division of Labour''. Subsequent winners have been Jan Edwards for her novel ''Winter Downs'' (2018), [[Charlotte Higgins]] for ''Red Thread: On Mazes and Labyrinths'' (2019) and Lisa Blower for her story collection ''It's Gone Dark Over Bill's Mother's'' (2020).<ref>[https://www.arnoldbennettsociety.org.uk/category/events/arnold-bennett-prize/ "Arnold Bennett Prize"], Arnold Bennett Society.
