'''Robert Lax''' (November 30, 1915 – September 26, 2000) was an American poet, known in particular for his association with [[Trappists|Trappist]] monk and writer [[Thomas Merton]]. Another friend of his youth was the painter [[Ad Reinhardt]]. After a long period of drifting from job to job about the world, Lax settled on the island of [[Patmos]] during the latter part of his life. Considered by some to be a self-exiled [[hermit]], he nonetheless welcomed visitors to his home, but did nothing to court publicity or expand his literary career or reputation.<ref>[https://www.hermitary.com/articles/lax.html ”Robert Lax, Enigmatic Hermit”], Hermitary, 2004]</ref>

==Life==
Lax was born in Olean to Sigmund and Rebecca Lax. His father had immigrated to the United States from Austria at the age of sixteen. When Robert was in eighth grade, the family moved to Elmhurst, Queens. He first met the future painter [[Ad Reinhardt]] at Elmhurst's [[Newtown High School (Queens)|Newtown High School]].<ref>McGregor 2017, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CBgBDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Robert+Lax&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiukeSp_a_iAhUBm-AKHTIyBQEQ6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&q=Robert%20Lax&f=false p.10]</ref>

Lax attended [[Columbia University]] in New York City, where he studied with the poet and critic [[Mark Van Doren]]. As a student there in the late 1930s, he worked on the college humor magazine ''[[Jester of Columbia|Jester]]'' with a classmate who became a close lifetime friend, Thomas Merton. Others on the ''Jester'' staff were [[Ed Rice]], founder and editor of ''Jubilee'' magazine (to which all three men contributed in the 1950s and '60s) and Ad Reinhardt.<ref name="McGregor 2017">McGregor 2017</ref> In his biography, ''The Seven Storey Mountain'', Merton describes Lax at a meeting with other ''Jester'' staff: "Taller than them all, and more serious, with a long face, like a horse, and a great mane of black hair on top of it, Bob Lax meditated on some incomprehensible woe."<ref>Thomas Merton, ''The Seven Storey Mountain'', New York 1998, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Oe8k-L0_bVkC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false p.197]</ref> Mark Van Doren has commented that "The woe, I now believe, was that Lax could not state his bliss; his love of the world and all things, all persons in it".<ref>''The Autobiography of Mark Van Doren'', Harcourt Brace, p.212]</ref>

After graduating in 1938, Lax joined the staff of ''[[The New Yorker]]'', working his way up from assistant poetry editor; he was also poetry editor of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, wrote screenplays in Hollywood, and taught at both the [[University of North Carolina]] and [[Connecticut College for Women]].<ref name="McGregor 2017"/> Around 1941 he and Merton volunteered for a couple of weeks at [[Catherine Doherty]]'s [[Friendship House]] in Harlem.<ref name=Whittaker>[http://www.conversations.org/story.php?sid=517 Whittaker, Richard. "Remembering Robert Lax—A Conversation with Steve Georgiou", ''Conversations'', May 11, 2017]</ref> Lax converted from Judaism to Catholicism in 1943, five years after Thomas Merton, and Rice was godfather to both men. But Lax desired a simple life, so he wandered, working in circuses in Canada as a clown and expert juggler. It was travelling with the Cristiani Brothers circus in 1949 that enabled him to generate material for his collection ''[[The circus of the sun|The Circus of the Sun]]'', although that was not published until 1959.

Meanwhile, Lax had helped Rice start ''Jubilee'', a lay Catholic magazine, in 1952 and became its roving editor. In 1953 he was in Paris, writing for a small literary magazine, ''New Story''. By 1962 he found his way to the Greek islands, initially settling in [[Kalymnos]], then moving on to [[Patmos]], where he spent his last years. Seeking relative solitude, Lax said it was important to "put yourself in a place where Grace can flow."<ref name=Whittaker/> The 1962-7 correspondence of Lax and Merton, written in a kind of comic argot, covered his early years in Greece and was first published as ''A Catch of Anti-Letters'' in 1978.<ref>Thomas Merton, Robert Lax, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QyXFFJdOxVYC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false ''A Catch of Anti-Letters''], Rowman & Littlefield, republished 1994]</ref> Later their correspondence over the years 1938-68 was published as ''When Prophecy Still Had a Voice''.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DGO8mse-lOIC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false ''When Prophecy Still Had a Voice: The Letters of Thomas Merton and Robert Lax''], University Press of Kentucky, 2001</ref>

In 1969, Lax received the National Council of the Arts Award. In 1990 he received an honorary doctorate from [[St. Bonaventure University]], a Franciscan institution near Olean, and became its first Reginald A. Lenna Visiting Professor of English, spending three weeks giving readings on campus.<ref>[https://www.sbu.edu/academics/english/news-publications-research/2017/02/28/award-winning-teacher-lax-biographer-to-visit-bonas-to-talk-about-iconic-olean-poet "Award-winning teacher, Lax biographer to visit #Bonas to talk about iconic Olean poet", St. Bonaventure University, February 28, 2017]</ref> The university now houses the main [http://archives.sbu.edu/lax/laxweb/default.htm Robert Lax archives]. Additional collections of his papers are at Columbia and Georgetown University.

During his final years on Patmos, Lax was the subject of Nicolas Hubert and Werner Penzel's 1999 film ''Why Should I Buy a Bed When All I Want Is Sleep?''<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTq-l26UOhw Why Should I Buy a Bed When All I Want Is Sleep? You Tube]</ref> He moved back to Olean in 2000, leaving Europe by ship from Southampton, accompanied by his niece and her husband, as he would not travel by air.<ref name=Hirschfield/> Shortly after, on 26 September, 2000, he died in his sleep at age 84.

==Writing==
Lax wrote hundreds of poems and dozens of books in his long career,<ref>[http://web.sbu.edu/friedsam/laxweb/Lax_works_published_separately.htm Lax bibliography]</ref> but never reached the level of recognition that some of his peers say he deserves. Jack Kerouac, whom he knew in New York, called Lax "one of the great original voices of our times ...a Pilgrim in search of beautiful innocence".<ref name=Hirschfield>[https://besharamagazine.org/arts-literature/robert-lax-a-life-slowly-lived/ Hirschfield, Robert. "Robert Lax: A Life slowly Lived", ''Beshara Magazine'', issue 12, 2019]</ref> ''Circus of the Sun'', a collection of poems metaphorically comparing the circus to [[Creationism|Creation]], was one of his most acclaimed works. On its publication in 1959, ''[[The New York Times]]'' hailed it as "perhaps the greatest English-language poem of this century."<ref>Timothy J. Keiderling,  [https://www.plough.com/en/topics/justice/sustainable-living/bard-of-gods-circus "Bard of God’s Circus: in search of Robert Lax"], ''Plough Quarterly'' #7, Winter 2016</ref> An excerpt was later distributed to those attending Lax's funeral at St. Bonaventure University on 29 September 29, 2000.

</poem>

Over the years following the composition of ''Circus of the Sun'', Lax's poetry became more and more stripped down to essentials, concentrating on simplicity and making the most out of the fewest components, a technique common to artistic [[minimalism]]. Sometimes these pieces consisted of single words, even single syllables, running page after page. As a consequence his work was perceived as sharing the characteristics of [[Concrete poetry]] and was included in [[Stephen Bann]]’s defining ''Poetry: An International Anthology'' (1967) and mentioned in [[Mary Ellen Solt]]’s study, ''Concrete Poetry: A World View'' (1968).<ref>Chapter 18, "United States", [http://www.ubu.com/papers/solt/us.html Ubu Web]</ref> 
Lax certainly shared an interest in artistic procedures with his friend Ad Reinhardt and reflected that artist's series of black paintings in his own "Homage to Reinhardt":
<poem>::black/black/black//  
::blue/blue/blue//  
::black/black/black/black//  
::blue/blue/blue<ref>Jack Kalmitz,''Views'', Seawall Press 2012, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Hj-zAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=Robert%20Lax&f=false pp.70-71]</ref></poem>

Specialist presses supported such gestures and brought out limited editions, such as the series of hand-written color poems that appeared as silkscreens from Edizioni Francesco Conz.<ref>[https://edizioniconz.com/artists/robert-lax Silkscreen on cloth, 1991]</ref> Even words were dispensed with in some of the 1971 publications from Journeyman Press. ''Mostly Blue'' consists of  graph paper filled in with colored squares,<ref>[https://www.abebooks.com/Ly-Blue-Lax-Robert-Emil-Antonucci/22496853455/bd#&gid=1&pid=1 A flick-through view at Abe Books]</ref> while ''Another Red Red Blue Poem'' is composed of thin bars of those colors. In an interview with Nicholas Zurbrugg, Lax later commented on his adoption of minimalist abstraction that "conversations with Reinhardt, and his directions in painting, certainly had an influence on my writing. Sometimes not specifically, but the general direction that he was working in certainly did—towards reducing the number of colours, reducing the form, and repeating the theme."<ref>''The ABCs of Robert Lax'', Stride Publications 1999, p.28</ref>

On another occasion he explained the creation of thin vertical columns of a few numbers or a single capital letter<ref>See Alexander 2004, p.118</ref> as arising from the wish to adopt the methods of abstract painters, "trying to find what the essence for me of a traditional poem is, and getting it down to that. . . . I wanted to see what it would be. I wanted to do it with the simplest elements."<ref>''Speaking Into Silence'', Stride, 2001, p.42</ref> In other instances, Lax used repetition of a few words either as a device for instilling a sense of serenity or to create a sense of surprise in the reader when a change in the pattern occurs. Despite the limited vocabulary of his poems, some create narratives, while others seem more like examples for use in meditative practice or even spiritual discipline. This can be experienced in the tape made of a 1974 performance of Lax's poems given by himself and Robert Wolf in 1974, resembling an uninflected incantation.<ref>A reading from ''Sea & Sky'', ''Black & White'' at [https://soundcloud.com/user-12431222/robert-lax-sea-sky-black-white SoundCloud]</ref> When Mark Van Doren expressed his doubt about Lax's change in direction, the poet suggested that he might appreciate them more by reading them aloud in this way.<ref>Alexander 2004, p.116</ref>

Karen Alexander comments on Lax's 1985 "Dark Earth Bright Sky", in which just those four words are repeated in different permutations: "We could not be more familiar with the simple contrasting elements in this poem, but we  often allow the  clutter of our lives to obscure our awareness of them.  Lax  meditates upon  them and presents them anew… This is truly essential poetry, poetry with its roots deep in the universal foundation of the human consciousness".<ref>Alexander 2017, p.214]</ref> And Ryo Yamaguchi, in drawing a parallel between Lax's poetry and the minimalist procedures in the art of [[Donald Judd]] and in the music of [[Philip Glass]] and [[Steve Reich]], also acknowledges the overlap into spirituality characteristic of the latter two.<ref>Ryo Yamaguchi, ''Michigan Quarterly Review'',[https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/mqr/2015/06/poems-1962-1997-by-robert-lax June 2015]</ref>

==Spirituality==
In the blurb for ''33 Poems'', William Maxwell, who had worked on ''The New Yorker'' with the poet, is quoted as commenting on Lax, "To the best of my knowledge, a saint is simply all the things that he is. If you placed him among the Old Testament figures above the south portal of Chartres, he wouldn't look odd." But although his output embodies a spiritual outlook, Lax was not a doctrinaire writer.  He owed as much to eastern as to western systems of spirituality.

For several years, Lax practiced the method of [[Passage Meditation|meditation]] developed by [[Eknath Easwaran]],<ref

I've done it now for three years whether I'm traveling on trains or wherever. I do it for half an hour anyway..." (p. 273).</ref> and near the end of his life, Lax's only reading each day was from Easwaran.<ref name=harford06/>{{rp|272,281}}<ref>Harford (2006) stated that "In his last year on [[Patmos]], in late 1999 and early 2000....  He [Lax] did no reading except for one quote per day from the [[Eknath Easwaran|Easwaran]] book" (p. 281).</ref>

==Interpretations==
Lax composed a 35-minute ''Black/White Oratorio'' using only nine colour-words and 'and'. This, as it was later arranged by John Beer, was to be performed by a chorus of nine to fifteen people.<ref>"David Bellingham Curates Robert Lax", [https://gsahatchery.wordpress.com/2017/09/18/david-bellingham-curates-robert-lax The Hatchery]</ref> Since 2014 there have been performances by the Los Angeles-based Readers Chorus.<ref>A 2015 Readers Chorus rendition of Robert Lax's "Black White Oratorio" on [https://soundcloud.com/readerschorus/05-blackwhite-oratorio-the-panorama SoundCloud]</ref>

Between 2011-15 there have also been four visual interpretations of Lax poems by German animator Susanne Wiegner, three of them based on readings by Lax and another interpreting the printed text.<ref>[http://movingpoems.com/poet/robert-lax Moving Poems]</ref>

In 2018 [[Kile Smith]] composed ''The Arc in the Sky'' on nine texts of Robert Lax, described as a 65-minute pilgrimage for unaccompanied choir.<ref>[https://www.crossingchoir.org/kiles-note Smith’s commentary]</ref><ref>A choral setting of “Jerusalem” from The Arc in the Sky [https://soundcloud.com/the-crossing/jerusalem-from-the-arc-in-the-sky-kile-smith-cd-previe “Jerusalem” on SoundCloud]</ref> The following year it was released commercially by Navona Records.<ref>[http://navonarecords.com/catalog/nv6240 Short excerpts]</ref>
