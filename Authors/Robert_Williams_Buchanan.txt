 |quote =<poem>
My girl hath violet eyes and yellow hair,
A soft hand, small and fair.
A sweet fate pouting in a white straw bonnet,
A tiny foot and a little boot upon it.
And all her finery to charm the beholders - 
Is the gray shawl drawn tight around her shoulders.
The plain stuff-gown and collar white as snow,
And sweet red petticoat that peeps below.
But gladly in the busy town goes she,
Summer and winter, fearing nobodie.
She pats the pavement with her fairy feet,
With fearless eyes she charms the crowded street.
</poem>|source =From “The Little Milliner” by Robert Williams Buchanan<ref>''The Poetical Works of Robert Buchanan'' (1884), London: Chatto & Windus, pp. 115-119.</ref><br />}}

Buchanan's first published works were books of poetry written while he was still living in Glasgow. He appears to have disowned them later in life as they fail to appear in any bibliographic references.  His first book was ''Poems and Love Lyrics'' which although undated was probably published in 1857.  It was reviewed in the ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenaeum]]'' in December 1857. Although the review date is not conclusive the date is almost certainly 1857 or 1858 for the following reasons. (1) The author's second book ''Mary and other Poems'' is by the 'Author of Lyrics'.  This book is dated 1859 and signed Robt W Buchanan in the preface; (2) The preface to 'Mary' states that this is the author's second published book; (3) The preface indicates that the writer is still a young man; (4) The dedication to Hugh Macdonald suggests he was alive when it was written.  Macdonald, a well-known Glaswegian, died in 1860.  Buchanan's second book ''Mary and other Poems'' was published in 1859 and has never been mentioned in any bibliographies.  The book is extremely rare and the only copies appear to be in the Mitchell library in Glasgow. Buchanan also published a collection of short stories and poems, written in collaboration with [[Charles Gibbon]], entitled ''Storm-beaten, or Christmas Eve at the "Old Anchor" Inn'' in 1862, before ''Undertones'', which is often cited as Buchanan's first book.

After a period of struggle and disappointment Buchanan published ''Undertones'' in 1863.  This tentative volume had some success, and was followed by ''Idyls and Legends of Inverburn'' (1865), ''London Poems'' (1866), and ''North Coast and other Poems'' (1868), wherein he displayed a faculty for poetic narrative, and a sympathetic insight into the humbler conditions of life.

Buchanan showed more ambition in ''The Book of Orm: A Prelude to the Epic'', a study in [[mysticism]], which appeared in 1870.<ref>Lilley, A. L. (1902). [http://www.robertbuchanan.co.uk/html/grein.html#lilley "Robert Buchanan,"] ''The Humane Review'', pp. 302–310.</ref> His works gave him a growing reputation, and raised high hopes of his future.  Thereafter he would take up prose fiction and the drama, not always with success.  He was a frequent contributor to periodicals, and obtained notoriety as a result of an article which, under the ''[[nom de plume]]'' of Thomas Maitland, he contributed to ''[[The Contemporary Review]]'' for October 1871.<ref>Cassidy, John A. (1952). [http://www.robertbuchanan.co.uk/html/cassidy.html "Robert Buchanan and the Fleshly Controversy,"] ''PMLA'', Vol. 67, No. 2, pp. 65–93.</ref> Entitled ''The Fleshly School of Poetry'',<ref>Buchanan, Robert Williams (1871). [https://archive.org/stream/contemporaryrev52unkngoog#page/n346/mode/2up "The Fleshly School of Poetry: Mr. D. G. Rossetti,"] ''The Contemporary Review'' '''18''', pp. 334–350.</ref> this article was expanded into a pamphlet (1872),<ref>Buchanan, Robert Williams (1872). [https://archive.org/stream/cu31924013268887#page/n5/mode/2up ''The Fleshly School of Poetry and Other Phenomena of the Day'']. London: Strahan & Co.</ref> but he subsequently withdrew from the criticisms it contained, and it is chiefly remembered by the replies it evoked from [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] in a letter to the ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenaeum]]'' (16 December 1871), entitled "The Stealthy School of Criticism",<ref>Reprinted in Rossetti's ''Collected Works'', 2 vols., London, 1886.</ref> and from [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]] in ''Under the Microscope'' (1872).<ref>Swinburne, Algernon Charles (1872). ''Under the Microscope''. London: D. White. [https://archive.org/stream/undertehmicrosc00swingoog#page/n12/mode/2up American edition], Portland, Maine: Thomas B. Mosher, 1889.</ref>

Buchanan afterwards regretted the violence of his attack,<ref>Buchanan, Robert Williams (1887). [https://archive.org/stream/lookroundliterat00buchrich#page/152/mode/2up "A Note on Dante Rossetti,"] in ''A Look Round Literature''. London: Ward and Downey, pp. 152–161.</ref> and the old enemy to whom ''God and the Man'' is dedicated was Rossetti.<ref>Buchanan, Robert Williams (1890). [https://archive.org/stream/godmanromance00buchrich#page/n7/mode/2up ''God and the Man'']. London: Chatto & Windus.</ref> In 1876 ''The Shadow of the Sword'', the first and one of the best of a long series of novels, was published.  Buchanan was also the author of many successful plays, including ''Lady Clare'', produced in 1883, ''Sophia'' (1886), an adaptation of ''Tom Jones; A Man's Shadow'' (1890), and ''The Charlatan'' (1894).  He also wrote, in collaboration with [[Harriett Jay]], the melodrama ''Alone in London''.  His latest poems, ''The Outcast: a Rhyme for the Time'' (1891) and ''The Wandering Jew'' (1893) were directed against certain aspects of Christianity.  In 1896 he became, so far as some of his work was concerned, his own publisher.  He was unfortunate in his latter years; a speculation turned out ruinously, and he had to sell his copyrights.

In November 1894 he campaigned very publicly for the release of murderer and bigamist [[James Canham Read]], known as the Southend Murderer. His campaign was unsuccessful and Read was hanged on 4 December.<ref>http://www.robertbuchanan.co.uk/html/pressletters12.html</ref>

In the autumn of 1900 he had a paralytic seizure, from which he never recovered.  He died at [[Streatham]]. He is buried in a family grave in the cemetery of St. John the Baptist Church, Southend on Sea, Essex; where there is a memorial to him.

Buchanan's poems were collected into three volumes in 1874, into one volume in 1884; and as ''Complete Poetical Works'' (2 vols., 1901).  Among his poems should also be mentioned:
*''The Drama of Kings'' (1871)
*''St Abe and his Seven Wives'', a lively tale of [[Salt Lake City]], Utah, published anonymously in 1872
*''Balder the Beautiful'' (1877)
*''The City of Dream'' (1888)

His earlier novels, ''The Shadow of the Sword'', and ''God and the Man'' (1881), a striking tale of a family feud, are distinguished by a certain breadth and simplicity of treatment which is not so noticeable in their successors, among which may be mentioned:
*''The Martyrdom of Madeline'' (1882)
*''Foxglove Manor'' (1885)
*''Effie Hetherington'' (1896)
*''Matt: A Story of A Caravan'' (1897)
*''Father Anthony'' (1898)In November 
*''Lady Kilpatrick''  (1898)
*''David Gray and other Essays, chiefly on Poetry'' (1868)
*''Master Spirits'' (1873)
*''A Poet's Sketch Book'' (1883), in which the interesting essay on Gray is reprinted
*''A Look round Literature'' (1887), and the previous volume contain Buchanan's chief contributions to periodical literature
*''The Land of Lorne'' (2 vols., 1871), a vivid record of yachting experiences on the west coast of Scotland.
*''The Master of the Mine'' (1885), originally serialised by the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'' in 1867.
