'''Milan Rakić''' ([[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Serbian Cyrillic]]: Милан Ракић; 18 September 1876 – 30 June 1938) was a Serbian [[poet-diplomat]]<ref name="Novosti ref">{{cite web |url=http://www.novosti.rs/dodatni_sadrzaj/clanci.119.html:591906-Pesnik-diplomata-i-oslobodilac |author=Večernje novosti |author-link=Večernje novosti |title= Pesnik, diplomata i oslobodilac |accessdate=2019-10-04 |date=2016-02-20 |language=Serbian}}</ref> and academic.

He focused on [[dodecasyllable]] and [[hendecasyllable]] verse, which allowed him to achieve beautiful [[rhythm]] and [[rhyme]] in his poems. He was quite a perfectionist and therefore only published two collections of poems (1903, 1912). He wrote largely about death and non-existence, keeping the tone sceptical and ironic. Two of his most well-known poems are ''An Honest Song'' (Iskrena pesma), ''A Desperate Song'' (Očajna pesma), ''Jefimija'', ''[[Simonida]]'' and ''At [[Gazimestan|Gazi-Mestan]]'' (Na Gazi-Mestanu). He was a member of the Serbian Royal Academy (1934).

==Biography==
[[File:Спомен-биста Милану Ракићу у Београду 1.jpg|thumb|right|Bust of Milan Rakić in Belgrade]]
===Early life===
Rakić was born on 18 September 1876 in [[Belgrade]] to father [[Mita Rakić|Mita]] and mother Ana (née Milićević). His father, educated abroad, was Serbia's Minister of Finance (1888) and his mother was the daughter of Serbian writer [[Milan Milićević]].

He finished elementary school (grade school) and high school (gymnasium) in [[Belgrade]]. He completed law school in Paris. It was in Paris that he, like [[Jovan Dučić]], came under the influence of French Symbolist poets. They both had learned to admire French culture and had dreamed of a better world after the war. After returning to Belgrade from [[Paris]] he became a diplomat (also like Dučić) for the Serbian (and later [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]]) government and remained in that job until nearly his death, representing the country abroad.<ref name="Novosti ref"/>

===Personal life===
His sister Ljubica was married to [[Milan Grol]]; and his wife Milica was the daughter of [[Ljubomir Kovačević]], a distinguished Serbian historian and politician.

===Death===
He died prematurely in 1938 in [[Zagreb]] after a surgical operation. He is interred in the [[Belgrade New Cemetery]].<ref>[http://graves.mf.uni-lj.si/graves/1626/milan-rakic International graves]</ref>
