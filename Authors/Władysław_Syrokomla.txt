'''Ludwik Władysław Franciszek Kondratowicz''' (29 September 1823 – 15 September 1862), better known as '''Władysław Syrokomla''', was a Polish romantic poet, writer and translator working in [[Vilnius]] and [[Vilna Governorate]], then [[Russian Empire]].

==Biography==
Syrokomla was born on 29 September 1823 in the village of [[Lyuban District|Smolków]], in the [[Minsk Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]] (now [[Lyuban District|Smolhava]], [[Minsk Region]], [[Belarus]]), to an impoverished [[szlachta|noble]] family.<ref name="Mikoś2002">{{cite book|author=Michael J. Mikoś|title=Polish romantic literature: an anthology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hl-AAAAAIAAJ|access-date=March 22, 2011|date=June 2002|publisher=Slavica|isbn=978-0-89357-281-5}}</ref><ref name="Soboleski1881"/><ref name="WIEM"/><ref name="pog"/> His parents were Aleksander Kajetan Kondratowicz (d. 1858) and Wiktoria (née Złotkowska).<ref name="PSB300"/> His uncle was Hilary Kondratowicz (1790–1823), a Polish teacher of maths in [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in [[Vilnius]], who published some articles in ''[[Wiadomości Brukowe]]''.<ref name=PSB300/><ref name="amu"/> A year after his birth his parents moved to another village ([[Jaśkowicze]]).<ref name=pog/> In 1833 he entered the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] school in [[Nesvizh]] (Nieśwież).<ref name=pog/> He had to give up his studies due to financial problems. In 1837 he began work in a [[Marchaczewszczyzna]] [[folwark]].<ref name=pog/> Between 1841 and 1844, he worked as a clerk in the [[Radziwiłł]] family land manager's office.<ref name=WIEM/><ref name=pog/> On 16 April 1844 in Niaśviž he married Paulina Mitraszewska, with whom he had four children; three of them would die in the same year (1852).<ref name=pog/>

In 1844 he published the first of his poems – ''Pocztylion'' – under the pen-name Władysław Syrokomla, coined after [[Syrokomla Coat of Arms|his family's coat of arms]].<ref name=WIEM/><ref name=pog/> The same year he also rented the small village of [[Załucze]].<ref name=WIEM/> In 1853, after the death of three of his children, he sold it or gave his manor to his parents, and settled in [[Vilnius]] itself.<ref name="Soboleski1881"/><ref name=WIEM/><ref name=pog/> After a few months he rented the village of [[Bareikiškės]], near Vilnius.<ref name=pog/> He became one of the editors (1861–1862) of the [[Kurier Wileński]], the largest and most prestigious Polish-language daily newspaper published in the Vilnius area.<ref name=WIEM/> In 1858 he visited [[Kraków]], and some time later he visited [[Warsaw]].<ref name="Soboleski1881"/> For taking part in an anti-tsarist demonstration in 1861 in Warsaw he was arrested by the [[Okhrana]] and then sentenced to home arrest in his manor in [[Bareikiškės]].<ref name=WIEM/><ref name=pog/> He died on 15 September 1862 and was buried in the [[Rasos Cemetery]] in Vilnius.<ref name="Soboleski1881"/><ref name=pog/>

Throughout his life, Syrokomla would remain impoverished; [[Czesław Miłosz]] wrote that he was "forever struggling against his lack of education and his poverty".<ref name=pog/><ref name="Miłosz1983"/> Despite that, Syrokomla had many influential and even wealthy friends; his manor was visited by count [[Eustachy Tyszkiewicz]], [[Stanisław Moniuszko]], [[Ignacy Chodźko]], [[Mikołaj Malinowski]], [[Antoni Pietkiewicz]] and others.<ref name=pog/>

== Works ==
Syrkomla was influenced by [[Adam Mickiewicz]].<ref name="Reddaway1971"/> In his prose he supported the liberation of [[peasant]]s and secession of the lands of former [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] from [[Imperial Russia]], which had annexed portions of the Commonwealth, including its Lithuanian areas (today parts of [[Belarus]] and the [[Republic of Lithuania]]), during [[Partitions of Poland|its late 18th-century partitions]].

Among the most notable of Syrokomla's works are translations of various Russian, French, Ukrainian, German and Latin poets, including works by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]], [[Mikhail Lermontov|Lermontov]], [[Taras Shevchenko|Shevchenko]], [[Nikolai Alekseevich Nekrasov|Nekrasov]], [[Pierre-Jean de Béranger|Béranger]] and others. His translations are considered a "great service" for the [[Polish language]].<ref name="Soboleski1881-2"/> Syrokomla also produced a number of works about the rustic nature, people and customs of Lithuania and Belarus.<ref name="Mikoś2002"/><ref name="Reddaway1971"/>

The vast majority of his works were written in the Polish language, however, he also wrote several poems in [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]].<ref name="Miłosz1983">{{cite book|author=Czesław Miłosz|title=The history of Polish literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R-MkT9vavwIC&pg=PA256|access-date=March 22, 2011|year=1983|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-04477-7|pages=256–}}</ref> Syrokomla is considered by some as one of the early influential writers in modern Belarusian language, although many of his Belarusian poems are believed to be lost.<ref name=belta/>

During his lifetime, his works were translated into several languages, including [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]].<ref name="TR"/> The composer [[Tchaikovsky]] adapted one of his works expressing a sympathetic view of the then-unliberated peasants – ''The Coral Beads'' – into a song.<ref name="Sylvester2004"/> He also wrote of the [[Crimean Karaites|Karaite]] community in Lithuania and its mosques and of a Jewish bookseller in Vilnius.<ref name="Marcinkowski2009"/><ref name="Hertz1988"/>

Some of his works are classified as ''[[gawęda]]'' (a story-like Polish epic literary genre).<ref name="Miłosz1983"/>

While majority of sources refer to him as a "Polish poet", his legacy is best understood in the context of the multicultural [[Polish-Lithuanian (adjective)|Polish-Lithuanian]] identity.<ref name="Venclova1999"/> His birthplace was located within the former [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]],<ref name="Miłosz1983"/> and he referred to himself as a Lithuanian when expressing own regional identity.<ref name="PotichnyjStudies1980"/> Syrokomla also identified himself with the land of modern Belarus and its people.<ref name=arche/> During Syrokomla's burial ceremony, the Lithuanian poet [[Edvardas Jokūbas Daukša]] emphasized that while Syrokomla was influenced by Polish culture, he was a Lithuanian poet, closest to Lithuania after [[Adam Mickiewicz]].<ref name=pog/><ref name=TR/> [[Teofil Lenartowicz]] wrote a memorial poem on his death referring to him as a "lirnik Litewski" (Lithuanian lyricist).<ref name="Żmichowska1894">{{cite book|author=Narcyza Żmichowska|title=Kwiaty rodzinne|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pBkPAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA249|access-date=October 8, 2011|year=1894|publisher=Nakład G. Gebethnera i spółki|page=249}}</ref> His works were often translated into Lithuanian and Belarusian languages.<ref name="PSB307"/>

In modern Belarus, he is being praised for depicting the life of 19th century Belarus and for his ethnographic research of Belarusians.<ref name=movananova/> In his publications, Syrokomla supported the Belarusian language and the Belarusian theatre plays by the playwright [[Vincent Dunin-Marcinkievič]].<ref name=belta/><ref name=liuban/>

In Belarus, there are streets named after W. Syrokomla (''vulica Uladzislava Syrakomli'') in [[Minsk]], [[Hrodna]] and in smaller towns [[Navahrudak]], [[Niasvizh]], [[Pinsk]], [[Vaukavysk]], [[Maladzechna]] and [[Pruzhany]]. In Smolhava a school is named after Syrokomla.<ref name=PSB307/>

In [[Warsaw|Warsaw's]] residential district [[Bródno]] (city district Warszawa-[[Targówek]]) there are two streets dedicated to the poet: Ludwik Kondratowicz St and Władysław Syrokomla St.

In Vilnius, a Polish-language school of the [[Polish minority in Lithuania]] is named after him.<ref name=PSB307/><ref name="syrokomla"/>
