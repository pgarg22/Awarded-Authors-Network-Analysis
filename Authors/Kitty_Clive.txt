'''Catherine Clive''' (née '''Raftor'''; 5 November 1711 – 6 December 1785) was a well-known English actress and occasional singer on London stages. She created the role of [[Delilah|Dalila]] in [[George Frideric Handel|Handel's]] 1743 oratorio ''[[Samson (Handel)|Samson]]''. She also did some writing. A definitive biography of Clive by Berta Joncus appeared in 2019.<ref>[https://boydellandbrewer.com/kitty-clive-or-the-fair-songster.html Berta Joncus, ''Kitty Clive, or the Fair Songster'' (Boydell Press, 2019)].</ref>

==Discovery==
[[File:Kitty Clive as Mrs Riot by Peter Van Bleeck in the Garrick Club.jpg|thumb|Kitty Clive as Mrs Riot by [[Peter Van Bleeck]] c.&nbsp;1750|left]]Kitty Raftor was probably born in London, but her father, William Raftor, was an Irishman and a former officer in the French army under [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]].{{sfn |Chisholm |1911 |p=531}} Her biographers say she worked as a girl as a servant in the homes of wealthy London families. At the age of 17, she was discovered by the theatre community when overheard singing as she cleaned the front steps of a house near a tavern that actors and playwrights patronized. She was referred to [[Colley Cibber]], manager of the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], who hired her in 1728.<ref>Melville, pp. 54–56.</ref>

==Career==

Her first role at Drury Lane was as the page boy Immenea in [[Nathaniel Lee]]'s tragedy ''Mithridates, King of Pontus''.<ref>Joncus, "Catherine Clive," Mary Hays, ''Female Biography; or, Memoirs of Illustrious and Celebrated Women, of All Ages and Countries'' (1803). ''Chawton House Library Series: Women’s Memoirs,'' ed. Gina Luria Walker, ''Memoirs of Women Writers Part II'' (Pickering & Chatto: London, 2013), vol. 7, pp. 401–404, notes p. 473.</ref> Throughout the 1730s she played further roles with success, becoming Drury Lane's leading comedy actress.<ref name="Caldwell" >Caldwell, ''Popular Plays by Women in the Restoration and Eighteenth Century'' (Peterborough, Canada: Broadview Press, 2011), p. 28 ff.</ref> In 1747 she became a founding member of [[David Garrick]]'s acting company. A [[soprano]], she occasionally sang on stage, notably when portraying Emma and Venus in the world première of [[Thomas Arne]]'s [[masque]] ''[[Alfred (Arne opera)|Alfred]]'' in 1740. She also created the role of Dalila in Handel's 1743 oratorio ''Samson''.{{sfn |Chisholm |1911 |p=532}}

Around 1732, Kitty Raftor married George Clive, a [[barrister]] brother of [[Robert Clive, 1st Baron Clive|Baron Clive]]. The marriage was not a success and they separated, although they never divorced. Kitty Clive remained economically independent. Because she never openly took lovers, Clive could keep her marriage vows and preserve her public reputation.<ref name="Caldwell"/> Her good standing with the public helped to strengthen the reputation of actresses in general, who were often looked down on as morally lax.<ref name="Ritchie">Fiona Ritchie, ''Women and Shakespeare in the Eighteenth Century'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2014), p. 43 ff.</ref>

On 15 April 1740 Clive appeared as Mrs Riot, the Fine Lady in [[David Garrick]]'s first successful play, ''Lethe; or Aesop in the Shades''. Her part at Drury Lane was recorded in a painting and a memorial porcelain figure. She chose this satirical role for her benefit.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://garrick.ssl.co.uk/object-g0121 |title=CollectionsOnline {{!}} G0121 |website=garrick.ssl.co.uk |language=en |access-date=2018-07-10}}</ref>

Clive rose to become one of the best paid actresses of her time, perhaps more than many male performers, who were traditionally paid more their female counterparts.<ref>[[Felicity Nussbaum]], ''Rival Queens: Actresses, Performance, and the Eighteenth-Century British Theater'' (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2010), p. 51.</ref> Her career on stage spanned over forty years. According to K. A. Crouch, "[h]er pay places her among the very best actresses of her generation."<ref>K. A. Crouch, "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5694 Clive , Catherine (1711–1785)]." ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', ed. H. C. G. Matthew and Brian Harrison. Oxford: OUP, 2006.</ref> Kitty Clive became a household name along with other theatre names of the time such as [[Lavinia Fenton]] and [[Susannah Cibber]]. She brought her earning power and fame to play as an open supporter of actors' rights, notably in a 1744 pamphlet, ''The Case of Mrs. Clive'', where she publicly shamed the managers [[Christopher Rich (theatre manager)|Christopher Rich]] and [[Charles Fleetwood (theatre manager)|Charles Fleetwood]] for conspiring to pay actors less than their due.<ref name="Ritchie"/> She also railed against the public's habit of associating actors with beggars and prostitutes.<ref name="Nussbaum">Felicity Nussbaum, ''Rival Queens: Actresses, Performance, and the Eighteenth-Century British Theater'' (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2010), pp. 163 ff.</ref>

Clive tried her hand at writing farces with some success. Her several satirical sketches with feminist undertones included ''The Rehearsal, or Boys in Petticoats'' (1750); ''Every Woman in her Humour'' (1760); and ''Sketches of a Fine Lady’s Return from a Rout'' (1763).<ref name="Nussbaum"/> In these she used humour to criticize the challenges that female performers and playwrights faced.<ref name="Caldwell"/>

==Memorials==
In 1761 Kitty Clive [[List of private residents of Covent Garden|lived in Henrietta Street]], Covent Garden. She retired in 1769 to a villa in [[Twickenham]], which had been a gift from her friend [[Horace Walpole]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=532}} She died there in 1785 and was buried at [[St Mary's, Twickenham]], where there is a memorial to her in the north-east corner of the church,<ref>Lynn F. Pearson, ''Discovering Famous Graves'' (2008, {{ISBN|0747806195}}), p. 82.</ref> inscribed with a poem that praises her generosity.

A pair of [[Bow porcelain factory|Bow]] figures of Clive and Henry Woodward as "the Fine Lady" and "the Fine Gentleman" in [[David Garrick]]'s mythological burlesque ''Lethe'', 1750–1752, may be "the earliest full-length portrait figures in English porcelain".<ref>J. V. G. Mallet: ''Rococo: Art and Design in Hogarth's England'' (London: Victorian and Albert Museum) 1984 (exhibition catalogue) O14, p. 248.</ref>

The [[Foundling Museum]] in London explored her life and career in an exhibition, ''Kitty Clive: The Creation of a Female Celebrity'', between 21 September 2018 and 30 December 2018.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://foundlingmuseum.org.uk/events/kitty-clive-the-creation-of-a-female-celebrity/ |title=Kitty Clive: The Creation of a Female Celebrity |work=Foundling Museum |access-date=2018-09-01 |language=en-GB}}</ref>
