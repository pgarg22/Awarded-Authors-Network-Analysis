'''Sir Henry John Newbolt''', [[Order of the Companions of Honour|CH]] (6 June 1862 – 19 April 1938) was an [[England|English]] [[poet]], novelist and historian.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Newbolt, Sir Henry (John)|journal=Who's Who|year=1920|page= 1892|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3452408;view=1up;seq=1940}}</ref> He also had a role as a government adviser with regard to the study of English in England. He is perhaps best remembered for his poems "Vitaï Lampada" and "Drake's Drum".

==Background==
Henry John Newbolt was born in [[Bilston]], [[Wolverhampton]] (then in [[Staffordshire]], but now in the West Midlands), son of the vicar of St Mary's Church, the Rev. Henry Francis Newbolt (1824–1866), and his second wife, Emily née Stubbs (1838–1921), the older brother of Sir [[Francis Newbolt]].<ref name=chitty>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m7U5AQAAIAAJ&q=%22sir+Francis+newbolt%22|title=Sir Thomas Chitty, 1st Baronet obituary|journal=Justice of the Peace and Local Government Review|volume=94|page=125|date=1930}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bFtWAAAAMAAJ&q=%22sir+Francis+newbolt%22|title=SIR Henry Newbolt|journal=Ships Monthly|volume=1|page=5|date=1966}}</ref> After his father's death, the family moved to [[Walsall]], where Henry was educated.

==Education==
Newbolt attended [[Queen Mary's Grammar School, Walsall]], and [[Caistor Grammar School]],{{citation needed|date=March 2021}} from which he gained a scholarship to [[Clifton College]],<ref>"Clifton College Register" Muirhead, J.A.O. p. 517: Bristol; J.W Arrowsmith for Old Cliftonian Society; April, 1948</ref> where he was head of the school (1881) and edited the school magazine. His contemporaries there included [[J. M. E. McTaggart|John McTaggart]], [[Arthur Quiller-Couch]], [[Roger Fry]], [[William Birdwood]], [[Francis Younghusband]] and [[Douglas Haig]]. Graduating from [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]], Newbolt was called to the bar at [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1887 and practised until 1899.

==Family==
[[File:Henry Newbolt.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Blue plaque near Newbolt's birthplace.]]
Newbolt married Margaret Edwina née Duckworth (1867–1960) of the prominent publishing family; they had two children:
* a son, Capt Arthur Francis Newbolt CMG (1893–1966) and,
* a daughter, Margaret Cecilia Newbolt (1890–1975), who in 1914 married Lt. Col. Sir Ralph Dolignon Furse KCMG DSO (1887–1973), the Head of Recruitment at [[HM Colonial Service]] from 1931 to 1948; they had four children.

Subsequently, it became apparent that behind Newbolt's prim Edwardian manner lay a far more complicated domestic life for Newbolt: a ''[[ménage à trois]]''.  His wife had a long-running lesbian affair with her cousin<ref>They were second cousins, Ella's paternal grandmother Anna Duckworth (1792–1873) was the sister of Margaret's grandfather William Duckworth (1795–1876).</ref> and childhood love, Laura Isabella 'Ella' Coltman (1863–1948).

Newbolt resided at 14 [[Victoria Road, Kensington|Victoria Road]] in [[Kensington]] from 1889 to 1898.<ref name="kensingtonpast114">{{cite book|last1=Denny|first1=Barbara|last2=Starren|first2=Carolyn|title=Kensington Past|date=1998|publisher=Historical Publications|location=London, U.K.|isbn=9780948667503|oclc=42308455|page=114|quote=Henry Newbolt, the patriotic poet of Drake's Drum and similar verse, found his house, at 14 Victoria Road from 1889 to 1898 small 'but not dark or cramped.'}}</ref>

==Publications==
His first book was a novel, ''Taken from the Enemy'' (1892), and in 1895 he published a tragedy, ''Mordred'';
but it was the publication of his ballads, ''Admirals All'' (1897), that created his literary reputation.  By far the best-known of these is "Vitaï Lampada". They were followed by other volumes of stirring verse, including ''The Island Race'' (1898), ''The Sailing of the Long-ships'' (1902), ''Songs of the Sea'' (1904) and ''Songs of the Fleet'' (1910).

In 1914, Newbolt published ''[[Aladore]]'', a fantasy novel about a bored but dutiful knight who abruptly abandons his estate and wealth to discover his heart's desire and woo a half-[[Fairy|fae]] enchantress. It is a tale filled with allegories about the nature of youth, service, individuality and tradition.  It was reissued in a new edition by [[Newcastle Publishing Company]] in 1975.

==="Vitaï Lampada"===
[[File:OldCliftonClose.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Clifton College]] Close]]

Probably the best known of all Newbolt's poems, which was written in 1892 and for which he is now chiefly remembered, is "Vitaï Lampada". The title is taken from a quotation by [[Lucretius]] and means "the torch of life".  It refers to how a schoolboy, a future soldier, learns selfless commitment to duty in cricket matches in the [[Clifton College Close Ground|Close at Clifton College]]:

:There's a breathless hush in the Close to-night—
:Ten to make and the match to win—
:A bumping pitch and a blinding light,
:An hour to play and the last man in.
:And it's not for the sake of a ribboned coat,
:Or the selfish hope of a season's fame,
:But his captain's hand on his shoulder smote
:"Play up! play up! and play the game!"

:The sand of the desert is sodden red,—
:Red with the wreck of a [[Infantry square|square]] that broke;—
:The [[Gatling]]'s jammed and the Colonel dead,
:And the regiment blind with dust and smoke.
:The river of death has brimmed his <!-- not "its" --> banks,
:And England's far, and Honour a name,
:But the voice of a schoolboy rallies the ranks:
:"Play up! play up! and play the game!"

:This is the word that year by year,
:While in her place the school is set,
:Every one of her sons must hear,
:And none that hears it dare forget.
:This they all with a joyful mind
:Bear through life like a torch in flame,
:And falling fling to the host behind—
:"Play up! play up! and play the game!"

The engagement mentioned in verse two is the [[Battle of Abu Klea]] in [[Sudan]] in January 1885 during the unsuccessful expedition to rescue [[Charles George Gordon|General Gordon]]. [[Frederick Burnaby]] is the colonel referred to in the line "The [[Gatling gun|Gatling]]'s jammed and the Colonel's dead...", although it was a [[Gardner gun|Gardner machine gun]] which jammed, and while Mahdist warriors did break into the British square, it did not collapse disastrously as the poem suggests.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishbattles.com/egypt-1882/abu-klea.htm|title = Battle of Abu Klea}}</ref>

==="Drake's Drum"===
According to legend [[Drake's Drum|the drum]] owned by [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]] and carried with him on his voyages will beat in times of national crisis and the spirit of Drake will return to aid his country. Sir Henry reinforced the myth with his 1897 poem "Drake's Drum", "Drake he's in his hammock an' a thousand mile away...":

:Drake he's in his hammock an' a thousand mile away, 
:(Capten, art tha sleepin' there below?) 
:Slung atween the round shot in [[Nombre de Dios, Colón|Nombre Dios Bay]], 
:An' dreamin' arl the time o' [[Plymouth Hoe]]. 
:Yarnder lumes the island, yarnder lie the ships,
:Wi' sailor lads a-dancin' heel-an'-toe, 
:An' the shore-lights flashin', an' the night-tide dashin' 
:He sees et arl so plainly as he saw et long ago.

:Drake he was a [[Devon]] man, an' ruled the Devon seas, 
:(Capten, art tha sleepin' there below?),
:Rovin' tho' his death fell, he went wi' heart at ease, 
:An' dreamin' arl the time o' Plymouth Hoe, 
:"Take my drum to England, hang et by the shore, 
:Strike et when your powder's runnin' low; 
:If the Dons sight Devon, I'll quit the port o' Heaven,
:An' drum them up the [[English Channel|Channel]] as we drummed them long ago."

:Drake he's in his hammock till the great [[Spanish Armada|Armada]]s come, 
:(Capten, art tha sleepin' there below?), 
:Slung atween the round shot, listenin' for the drum, 
:An' dreamin' arl the time o' Plymouth Hoe.
:Call him on the deep sea, call him up [[Plymouth Sound|the Sound]], 
:Call him when ye sail to meet the foe; 
:Where the old trade's plyin' an' the old flag flyin', 
:They shall find him, ware an' wakin', as they found him long ago.<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/103/41.html Henry Newbolt, "Drake's Drum," Bartleby.com]</ref>

The poem has been widely anthologised and has been set to both classical and folk tunes. "Drake's Drum" is the first of five poetic settings by the composer [[Charles Villiers Stanford]].  Stanford wrote two song cycles based on poems by Newbolt: ''[[Songs of the Sea (Stanford)|Songs of the Sea]]'' and ''Songs of the Fleet''.

===''Monthly Review''===
Newbolt was the editor of the ''Monthly Review'' from October 1900 to September 1904.<ref>[http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/3125543?lookfor=(title:monthly%20AND%20title:review)%20AND%20&offset=1&max=9 ''The Monthly Review'' (1900–1907), National Library of Australia]</ref> He was also a member of the [[Athenaeum Club, London|Athenaeum]] and the [[Coefficients (dining club)|Coefficients dining club]].

==War and history==
At the start of the First World War, Newbolt – along with over 20 other leading British writers – was brought into the [[Wellington House|War Propaganda Bureau]], which had been formed to promote Britain's interests during the war and maintain public opinion in favour of the war.

He subsequently became Controller of Telecommunications at the Foreign Office.  His poems about the war include "The War Films", printed on the leader page of ''[[The Times]]'' on 14 October 1916, which seeks to temper the shock effect on cinema audiences of footage of the [[The Battle of the Somme (film)|Battle of the Somme]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Bogacz|first1= Theodore W |year= 2013|title= A change of language? Sassoon, The Great War, ''The Times'' and ''The Nation''|journal= Siegfried's Journal|volume= 23|issue= Winter|pages= 17 |publisher= Siegfried Sassoon Fellowship}}</ref>

Newbolt was knighted in 1915 and was appointed [[Companion of Honour]] in 1922.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=32563|date=31 December 1921|page=10716 |supp=y}}</ref>

== The Newbolt Report ==
In 1921 he had been the author of a government Report entitled "The Teaching of English in England" which established the foundations for modern English Studies and professionalised the forms of teaching of English Literature.  It established a canon, argued that English must become the linguistic and literary standard throughout the British Empire, and even proposed salary rates for lecturers.  For many years it was a standard work for English teachers in teacher training Colleges.<ref>The Newbolt Report (1921) The Teaching of English.

==Death and legacy==
[[Image:Henry Newbolt No. 2 by William Strang 1898.jpg|thumb|Sir Henry John Newbolt, Etching by William Strang. 1898]]

Newbolt died at his home in [[Campden Hill]], [[Kensington]], London, on 19 April 1938, aged 75.<ref name="Oxford Dictionary of National Biography">{{cite ODNB |title= Newbolt, Sir Henry John (1862–1938)| last= Gervais | first= David |date= 2004|doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/35212}}</ref> A [[blue plaque]] there commemorates his residency. He is buried in the churchyard of [[Church of St Mary, Orchardlea|St Mary's church]] on an island in [[Orchardleigh Lake|the lake]] on the [[Orchardleigh Estate]] of the Duckworth family in Somerset.

In his home town of Bilston, a [[:File:The Sir Henry Newbolt - geograph.org.uk - 675033.jpg|public house]] was named after him, and a [[blue plaque]] is displayed on Barclay's bank near the street where he was born.

In June 2013 a campaign was launched by ''[[The Black Country Bugle]]'' to erect a statue in Newbolt's memory.

Recordings were made of Newbolt reading some of his own poems. They were on four 78rpm sides in the [[Columbia Records]] "International Educational Society" Lecture series, Lecture 92 (D40181/2).<ref>Catalogue of Columbia Records, Up to and including Supplement no. 252 (Columbia Graphophone Company, London September 1933), p. 375.</ref>
