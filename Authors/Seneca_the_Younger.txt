'''Lucius Annaeus Seneca the Younger''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɛ|n|ɪ|k|ə}}; {{nowrap|c. 4 BC –}} AD{{nbsp}}65),<ref>''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', [https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lucius-Annaeus-Seneca-Roman-philosopher-and-statesman s.v. Seneca].</ref> usually known as '''Seneca''', was a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Stoicism|Stoic]] [[philosopher]], statesman, [[dramatist]], and in one work, [[satirist]], from the post-Augustan age of [[Latin literature]].

Seneca was born in [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Cordoba]] in [[Hispania]], and raised in [[Rome]], where he was trained in [[rhetoric]] and [[philosophy]]. His father was [[Seneca the Elder]], his elder brother was [[Lucius Junius Gallio Annaeanus]], and his nephew was the poet [[Lucan]]. In AD 41, Seneca was exiled to the island of [[Corsica]] under emperor [[Claudius]],<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fitch|first=John|title=Seneca|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-19-928208-1|location=New York|pages=32}}</ref> but was allowed to return in 49 to become a tutor to [[Nero]]. When Nero became emperor in 54, Seneca became his advisor and the praetorian prefect [[Sextus Afranius Burrus]], provided competent government for the first five years of Nero's reign. Seneca's influence over Nero declined with time, and in 65 Seneca was [[forced suicide|forced to take his own life]] for alleged complicity in the [[Pisonian conspiracy]] to [[Assassination|assassinate]] Nero, in which he was likely to have been innocent.<ref>{{cite book| author=Bunson, Matthew| title= A Dictionary of the Roman Empire| page = 382| publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]|date= 1991}}</ref> His stoic and calm [[suicide]] has become the subject of numerous paintings.

As a writer Seneca is known for his philosophical works, and for [[Senecan tragedy|his plays]], which are all [[Tragedy|tragedies]]. His prose works include a dozen essays and [[Epistulae Morales ad Lucilium|one hundred twenty-four letters]] dealing with moral issues. These writings constitute one of the most important bodies of primary material for ancient [[Stoicism]]. As a tragedian, he is best known for plays such as his ''[[Medea (Seneca)|Medea]]'', ''[[Thyestes (Seneca)|Thyestes]]'', and ''[[Phaedra (Seneca)|Phaedra]]''. Seneca's influence on later generations is immense—during the Renaissance he was "a sage admired and venerated as an oracle of moral, even of Christian edification; a master of literary style and a model [for] dramatic art."<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Watling|first1=E.

===Early life, family and adulthood===
Seneca was born in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] in the Roman province of [[Hispania Baetica|Baetica]] in [[Hispania]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Habinek|2013|p=6}}</ref> His father was [[Seneca the Elder|Lucius Annaeus Seneca the elder]], a Spanish-born [[Equites|Roman knight]] who had gained fame as a writer and teacher of rhetoric in Rome.<ref name="dandy">{{Cite book|author-first=Stephen|author-last=Dando-Collins|title=Blood of the Caesars: How the Murder of Germanicus Led to the Fall of Rome|year=2008|page=47|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0470137413}}</ref> Seneca's mother, Helvia, was from a prominent Baetician family.<ref name="habby7">{{Harvnb|Habinek|2013|p=7}}</ref> Seneca was the second of three brothers; the others were [[Lucius Junius Gallio Annaeanus|Lucius Annaeus Novatus]] (later known as Junius Gallio), and Annaeus Mela, the father of the poet [[Lucan]].<ref name="rgm92">{{Harvnb|Reynolds|Griffin|Fantham|2012|p=92}}</ref> [[Miriam Griffin]] says in her biography of Seneca that "the evidence for Seneca's life before his exile in 41 is so slight, and the potential interest of these years, for social history as well as for biography, is so great that few writers on Seneca have resisted the temptation to eke out knowledge with imagination."<ref name="thegriff">Miriam T. Griffin. ''Seneca: A Philosopher in Politics'', Oxford 1976. 34.</ref> Griffin also infers from the ancient sources that Seneca was born in either 8, 4, or 1 BC.

Seneca tells us that he was taken to [[Rome]] in the "arms" of his aunt (his mother's stepsister) at a young age, probably when he was about five years old.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wilson|2014|p=48}} citing ''De Consolatione ad Helviam Matrem'' 19.2</ref> His father resided for much of his life in the city.<ref name="asmi7">{{Harvnb|Asmis|Bartsch|Nussbaum|2012|p=vii}}</ref> Seneca was taught the usual subjects of literature, grammar, and rhetoric, as part of the standard education of high-born Romans.<ref name="habby8">{{Harvnb|Habinek|2013|p=8}}</ref> While still young he received philosophical training from [[Attalus (Stoic)|Attalus]] the [[Stoicism|Stoic]], and from [[Sotion (Pythagorean)|Sotion]] and [[Papirius Fabianus]], both of whom belonged to the short-lived [[School of the Sextii]], which combined Stoicism with [[Pythagoreanism]].<ref name="rgm92"/> Sotion persuaded Seneca when he was a young man (in his early twenties) to become a [[vegetarian]], which he practised for around a year before his father urged him to desist because the practice was associated with "some foreign rites".<ref>{{Harvnb|Wilson|2014|p=56}}</ref> Seneca often had breathing difficulties throughout his life, probably [[asthma]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Wilson|2014|p=32}}</ref> and at some point in his mid-twenties (c. 20 AD) he appears to have been struck down with [[tuberculosis]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Wilson|2014|p=57}}</ref> He was sent to [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]] to live with his aunt (the same aunt who had brought him to Rome), whose husband [[Gaius Galerius]] had become [[Prefect of Egypt]].<ref name="habby7"/> She nursed him through a period of ill-health that lasted up to ten years.<ref name="wilko62">{{Harvnb|Wilson|2014|p=62}}</ref> In 31 AD he returned to Rome with his aunt, his uncle dying en route in a shipwreck.<ref name="wilko62"/> His aunt's influence helped Seneca be elected [[quaestor]] (probably after 37 AD<ref name="habby8"/>), which also earned him the right to sit in the [[Roman Senate]].<ref name="wilko62"/>

===Politics and exile===
Seneca's early career as a senator seems to have been successful and he was praised for his oratory.<ref name="brauny24">{{Harvnb|Braund|2015|p=24}}</ref> [[Cassius Dio]] relates a story that [[Caligula]] was so offended by Seneca's oratorical success in the Senate that he ordered him to commit suicide.<ref name="brauny24"/> Seneca only survived because he was seriously ill and Caligula was told that he would soon die anyway.<ref name="brauny24"/> In his writings Seneca has nothing good to say about Caligula and frequently depicts him as a monster.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wilson|2014|p=67}}</ref> Seneca explains his own survival as down to his patience and his devotion to his friends: "I wanted to avoid the impression that all I could do for loyalty was die."<ref>{{Harvnb|Wilson|2014|p=67}} citing ''Naturales Quaestiones'', 4.17</ref>

In 41 AD, [[Claudius]] became emperor, and Seneca was accused by the new empress [[Messalina]] of adultery with [[Julia Livilla]], sister to Caligula and [[Agrippina the Younger|Agrippina]].<ref name="habby9">{{Harvnb|Habinek|2013|p=9}}</ref> The affair has been doubted by some historians, since Messalina had clear political motives for getting rid of Julia Livilla and her supporters.<ref name="asmi7"/><ref name="wilko79">{{Harvnb|Wilson|2014|p=79}}</ref> The Senate pronounced a death sentence on Seneca, which Claudius commuted to exile, and Seneca spent the next eight years on the island of [[Corsica]].<ref name="brauny23">{{Harvnb|Braund|2015|p=23}}</ref> Two of Seneca's earliest surviving works date from the period of his exile&mdash;both [[Seneca's Consolations|consolations]].<ref name="habby9"/> In his ''Consolation to Helvia'', his mother, Seneca comforts her as a bereaved mother for losing her son to exile.<ref name="brauny23"/> Seneca incidentally mentions the death of his only son, a few weeks before his exile.<ref name="brauny23"/> Later in life Seneca was married to a woman younger than himself, [[Pompeia Paulina]].<ref name="rgm92"/> It has been thought that the infant son may have been from an earlier marriage,<ref name="brauny23"/> but the evidence is "tenuous".<ref name="rgm92"/> Seneca's other work of this period, his ''Consolation to [[Polybius (freedman)|Polybius]]'', one of Claudius' freedmen, focused on consoling Polybius on the death of his brother. It is noted for its flattery of Claudius, and Seneca expresses his hope that the emperor will recall him from exile.<ref name="brauny23"/> In 49 AD Agrippina married her uncle Claudius, and through her influence Seneca was recalled to Rome.<ref name="habby9"/> Agrippina gained the [[praetor]]ship for Seneca and appointed him tutor to her son, the future emperor [[Nero]].<ref name="brauny22">{{Harvnb|Braund|2015|p=22}}</ref>

===Imperial advisor===
[[File:Nerón y Séneca (Barrón).JPG|thumb|right|Nero and Seneca, by [[Eduardo Barrón González|Eduardo Barrón]] (1904). [[Museo del Prado]]]]
From AD 54 to 62, Seneca acted as Nero's advisor, together with the [[praetorian prefect]] [[Sextus Afranius Burrus]]. One by-product of his new position was that Seneca was appointed [[suffect consul]] in 56.<ref>The ''Senatus Consultum Trebellianum'' was dated to 25 August in his consulate, which he shared with Trebellius Maximus. ''Digest'' 36.1.1</ref> Seneca's influence was said to have been especially strong in the first year.<ref>[[Cassius Dio]] claims Seneca and Burrus "took the rule entirely into their own hands," but "after the death of Britannicus, Seneca and Burrus no longer gave any careful attention to the public business" in 55 (Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', LXI.3–7)</ref> Seneca composed Nero's accession speeches in which he promised to restore proper legal procedure and authority to the Senate.<ref name="brauny22"/> He also composed the eulogy for Claudius that Nero delivered at the funeral.<ref name="brauny22"/> Seneca's satirical skit ''[[Apocolocyntosis]]'', which lampoons the deification of Claudius and praises Nero dates from the earliest period of Nero's reign.<ref name="brauny22"/> In 55 AD, Seneca wrote ''[[De Clementia|On Clemency]]'' following Nero's murder of [[Britannicus]], perhaps to assure the citizenry that the murder was the end, not the beginning of bloodshed.<ref name="habby10">{{Harvnb|Habinek|2013|p=10}}</ref> ''On Clemency'' is a work which, although it flatters Nero, was intended to show the correct (Stoic) path of virtue for a ruler.<ref name="brauny22"/> [[Tacitus]] and Dio suggest that Nero's early rule, during which he listened to Seneca and Burrus, was quite competent. However, the ancient sources suggest that, over time, Seneca and Burrus lost their influence over the emperor. In 59 they had reluctantly agreed to Agrippina's murder, and afterward Tacitus reports that Seneca had to write a letter justifying the murder to the Senate.<ref name="habby10"/>

In 58 AD the senator [[Publius Suillius Rufus]] made a series of public attacks on Seneca.<ref name="brauny21">{{Harvnb|Braund|2015|p=21}}</ref> These attacks, reported by [[Tacitus]] and [[Cassius Dio]],<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' xiii.42; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' lxi.33.9.</ref> included charges that, in a mere four years of service to Nero, Seneca had acquired a vast personal fortune of three hundred million [[Sestertius|sestertii]] by charging high interest on loans throughout Italy and the provinces.<ref name="asmi9">{{Harvnb|Asmis|Bartsch|Nussbaum|2012|p=ix}}</ref> Suillius' attacks included claims of sexual corruption, with a suggestion that Seneca had slept with Agrippina.<ref name="wilko130">{{Harvnb|Wilson|2014|p=130}}</ref> Tacitus, though, reports that Suillius was highly prejudiced: he had been a favourite of Claudius,<ref name="brauny21"/> and had been an embezzler and informant.<ref name="asmi9"/> In response, Seneca brought a series of prosecutions for corruption against Suillius: half of his estate was confiscated and he was sent into exile.<ref name="wilko131">{{Harvnb|Wilson|2014|p=131}}</ref> However, the attacks reflect a criticism of Seneca that was made at the time and continued through later ages.<ref name="brauny21"/> Seneca was undoubtedly extremely rich: he had properties at [[Baiae]] and [[Nomentum]], an [[Alba Longa|Alban]] villa, and Egyptian estates.<ref name="brauny21"/> Cassius Dio even reports that the [[Boudica]] uprising in [[Roman Britain|Britannia]] was caused by Seneca forcing large loans on the indigenous British aristocracy in the aftermath of Claudius's [[Roman conquest of Britain|conquest of Britain]], and then calling them in suddenly and aggressively.<ref name="brauny21"/> Seneca was sensitive to such accusations: his ''[[De Vita Beata]]'' ("On the Happy Life") dates from around this time and includes a defence of wealth along Stoic lines, arguing that properly gaining and spending wealth is appropriate behaviour for a philosopher.<ref name="asmi9"/>

===Retirement===
After Burrus' death in 62, Seneca's influence declined rapidly; as Tacitus puts it (Ann. 14.52.1), ''mors Burri infregit Senecae potentiam'' ("the death of Burrus broke Seneca's power").<ref>{{Harvnb|Braund|2015|p=viii}}</ref> Tacitus reports that Seneca tried to retire twice, in 62 and 64 AD, but Nero refused him on both occasions.<ref name="asmi9"/> Nevertheless, Seneca was increasingly absent from the court.<ref name="asmi9"/> He adopted a quiet lifestyle on his country estates, concentrating on his studies and seldom visiting Rome. It was during these final few years that he composed two of his greatest works: ''[[Naturales quaestiones]]''&mdash;an encyclopedia of the natural world; and his ''[[Letters to Lucilius]]''&mdash;which document his philosophical thoughts.<ref name="habby14">{{Harvnb|Habinek|2013|p=14}}</ref>

===Death===

[[File:Lodovico Lana, Death of Seneca, NGA 55766.jpg|thumb|Lodovico Lana, ''Death of Seneca'', [[National Gallery of Art]]]]
In AD 65, Seneca was caught up in the aftermath of the [[Pisonian conspiracy]], a plot to kill Nero. Although it is unlikely that Seneca was part of the conspiracy, Nero ordered him to kill himself.<ref name="asmi9"/> Seneca followed tradition by severing several [[vein]]s in order to [[exsanguination|bleed to death]], and his wife Pompeia Paulina attempted to share his fate. Cassius Dio, who wished to emphasize the relentlessness of Nero, focused on how Seneca had attended to his last-minute letters, and how his death was hastened by soldiers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Habinek|2013|p=16}} citing Cassius Dio ii.25</ref>  A generation after the Julio-Claudian emperors, [[Tacitus]] wrote an account of the suicide, which, in view of his Republican sympathies, is perhaps somewhat romanticized.<ref name="brodby">{{cite book|author1-last=Church|author1-first=Alfred John|author2-last=Brodribb|author2-first=William Jackson|title=Tacitus: The Annals of Imperial Rome |chapter=xv| location=New York|publisher= [[Barnes & Noble]] |date=2007|page=341}} citing Tacitus ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'', xv. 60–64</ref> According to this account, Nero ordered Seneca's wife saved. Her wounds were bound up and she made no further attempt to kill herself. As for Seneca himself, his age and diet were blamed for slow loss of blood and extended pain rather than a quick death. He also took poison, which was, however, not fatal. After dictating his last words to a scribe, and with a circle of friends attending him in his home, he immersed himself in a warm bath, which he expected would speed blood flow and ease his pain. Tacitus wrote, "He was then carried into a bath, with the steam of which he was suffocated, and he was burnt without any of the usual funeral rites.  So he had directed in a codicil of his will, even when in the height of his wealth and power he was thinking of life's close."<ref name="brodby"/> This may give the impression of a favourable portrait of Seneca, but Tacitus' treatment of him is at best ambivalent. Alongside Seneca's apparent fortitude in the face of death, for example, one can also view his actions as rather histrionic and performative; and when Tacitus tells us that he left his family an ''imago suae vitae'' (''Annales'' 15.62), "an image of his life", he is possibly being ambiguous: in Roman culture, the ''imago'' was a kind of mask that commemorated the great ancestors of noble families, but at the same time, it may also suggest duplicity, superficiality, and pretence.<ref>Tacitus, Annales 15.62.</ref>

Ten plays are attributed to Seneca, of which most likely eight were written by him.<ref name="asmi23">{{Harvnb|Asmis|Bartsch|Nussbaum|2012|p=xxiii}}</ref> The plays stand in stark contrast to his philosophical works. With their intense emotions, and grim overall tone, the plays seem to represent the antithesis of Seneca's Stoic beliefs.<ref name="asmi20">{{Harvnb|Asmis|Bartsch|Nussbaum|2012|p=xx}}</ref> Up to the 16th century it was normal to distinguish between Seneca the moral philosopher and Seneca the dramatist as two separate people.<ref>{{Harvnb|Laarmann|2013|p=53}}</ref> Scholars have tried to spot certain Stoic themes: it is the uncontrolled passions that generate madness, ruination, and self-destruction.<ref name="gill58">{{Harvnb|Gill|1999|p=58}}</ref> This has a cosmic as well as an ethical aspect, and fate is a powerful, albeit rather oppressive, force.<ref name="gill58"/>

Many scholars have thought, following the ideas of the 19th-century German scholar [[Friedrich Leo]], that Seneca's tragedies were written for recitation only.<ref>The chief modern proponent of this view is Otto Zwierlein, ''Die Rezitationsdramen Senecas'', 1966.</ref> Other scholars think that they were written for performance and that it is possible that actual performance took place in Seneca's lifetime.<ref>George W.M. Harrison (ed.), ''Seneca in performance'', London: Duckworth, 2000.</ref> Ultimately, this issue cannot be resolved on the basis of our existing knowledge.<ref name="asmi23"/> The tragedies of Seneca have been successfully staged in modern times.

The dating of the tragedies is highly problematic in the absence of any ancient references.<ref name="rgm94">{{Harvnb|Reynolds|Griffin|Fantham|2012|p=94}}</ref> A parody of a lament from ''[[Hercules (Seneca)|Hercules Furens]]'' appears in the ''[[Apocolocyntosis]]'', which implies a date before 54 AD for that play.<ref name="rgm94"/> A relative chronology has been proposed on metrical grounds.<ref>John G.

Works attributed to Seneca include a dozen philosophical essays, one hundred and twenty-four [[Epistulae morales ad Lucilium|letters]] dealing with [[moral]] issues, nine [[tragedy|tragedies]], and a [[satire]], the attribution of which is disputed.<ref>Brockett, O. (2003), ''History of the Theatre'': Ninth Ed. Allyn and Bacon. p. 50</ref> His authorship of ''Hercules on Oeta'' has also been questioned.

===Seneca's tragedies===
''[[Fabulae crepidatae]]'' (tragedies with Greek subjects):
* ''[[Hercules (Seneca)|Hercules]]'' or ''Hercules furens'' (''The Madness of Hercules'')
* ''[[Troades (Seneca)|Troades]]'' (''The Trojan Women'')
* ''[[Phoenissae (Seneca)|Phoenissae]]'' (''The Phoenician Women'')
* ''[[Medea (Seneca)|Medea]]''
* ''[[Phaedra (Seneca)|Phaedra]]''
* ''[[Oedipus (Seneca)|Oedipus]]''
* ''[[Agamemnon (Seneca)|Agamemnon]]''
* ''[[Thyestes (Seneca)|Thyestes]]''
* ''[[Hercules Oetaeus]]'' (''Hercules on Oeta''): generally considered not written by Seneca. First rejected by [[Daniël Heinsius]].

''[[Fabula praetexta]]'' (tragedy in Roman setting):
* ''[[Octavia (play)|Octavia]]'': almost certainly not written by Seneca (at least in its final form) since it contains accurate prophecies of both his and Nero’s deaths.<ref>R Ferri ed., ''Octavia'' (2003) pp. 5–9</ref> This play closely resembles Seneca's plays in style, but was probably written some time after Seneca's death (perhaps under Vespasian) by someone influenced by Seneca and aware of the events of his lifetime.<ref>H J Rose, ''A Handbook of Latin Literature'' (London 1967) p. 375</ref> Though attributed textually to Seneca, the attribution was early questioned by [[Petrarch]],<ref>R Ferri ed., ''Octavia'' (2003) p. 6</ref> and rejected by [[Justus Lipsius]].

====Spurious====

* (58–62/370?) ''[[Epistle to Seneca the Younger|Cujus etiam ad Paulum apostolum leguntur epistolae]]:'' These letters, allegedly between Seneca and St Paul, were revered by early authorities, but modern scholarship rejects their authenticity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/tixeront/section1-3.html#epistles |title=Apocryphal epistles |work=Earlychristianwritings.com |date=2 February 2006 |access-date=26 July 2011}}</ref><ref>[[Joseph Barber Lightfoot]] (1892) [http://www.biblestudytools.com/classics/lightfoot-dissertations-on-the-apostolic-age/st-paul-and-seneca.html St Paul and Seneca] ''Dissertations on the Apostolic Age''</ref>

==="Pseudo-Seneca"<!--Linked from [[Pseudo-Seneca]]-->===
Various antique and medieval texts purport to be by Seneca, ''e.g.'', ''De remediis fortuitorum''. Their unknown authors are collectively called "Pseudo-Seneca."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bml.firenze.sbn.it/Seneca/eng/pseudo_seneca_contenuto.html|title=Pseudo-Seneca|website=www.bml.firenze.sbn.it}}</ref>  At least some of these seem to preserve and adapt genuine Senecan content, for example, Saint [[Martin of Braga]]'s (d. c. 580) ''Formula vitae honestae'', or ''De differentiis quatuor virtutumvitae honestae'' ("Rules for an Honest Life", or "On the Four Cardinal Virtues").  Early manuscripts preserve Martin's preface, where he makes it clear that this was his adaptation, but in later copies this was omitted, and the work was later thought fully Seneca's work.<ref>István Pieter Bejczy, ''The Cardinal Virtues in the Middle Ages: A Study in Moral Thought from the Fourth to the Fourteenth Century'', Brill, 2011, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VgPRu0CJ_sQC&pg=PA55 pp. 55–56].</ref>  Seneca is also often quoted as having stated that "Religion is regarded by the common people as true, by the wise as false, and by the rulers as useful";<ref>[https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/45750-religion-is-regarded-by-the-common-people-as-true-by GoodReads] (retrieved 5 November 2021)</ref> this is based on a translation by [[Edward Gibbon]], but is [http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Seneca_the_Younger#Disputed disputed].

==Legacy==
===As a proto-Christian saint===
[[File:Plato Seneca Aristotle medieval.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Plato]], Seneca, and [[Aristotle]] in a medieval manuscript illustration (c. 1325–35)]]

Seneca's writings were well known in the later Roman period, and [[Quintilian]], writing thirty years after Seneca's death, remarked on the popularity of his works amongst the youth.<ref name="lars54a"/> While he found much to admire, Quintillian criticised Seneca for what he regarded as a degenerate literary style&mdash;a criticism echoed by [[Aulus Gellius]] in the middle of the 2nd century.<ref name="lars54a">{{Harvnb|Laarmann|2013|p=54}} citing Quintilian, ''Institutio Oratoria'', x.1.126f; Aulus Gellius, ''Noctes Atticae'', xii. 2.</ref>

The early Christian Church was very favourably disposed towards Seneca and his writings, and the church leader [[Tertullian]] possessively referred to him as "our Seneca".<ref>Moses Hadas. ''The Stoic Philosophy of Seneca'', 1958. 1.</ref> By the 4th century an [[Correspondence of Paul and Seneca|apocryphal correspondence]] with [[Paul the Apostle]] had been created linking Seneca into the Christian tradition.<ref name="lars54">{{Harvnb|Laarmann|2013|p=54}}</ref> The letters are mentioned by [[Jerome]] who also included Seneca among a list of Christian writers, and Seneca is similarly mentioned by [[Augustine]].<ref name="lars54"/> In the 6th century [[Martin of Braga]] synthesised Seneca's thought into a couple of treatises that became popular in their own right.<ref name="lars55">{{Harvnb|Laarmann|2013|p=55}}</ref> Otherwise, Seneca was mainly known through a large number of quotes and extracts in the ''[[florilegium|florilegia]]'', which were popular throughout the medieval period.<ref name="lars55"/> When his writings were read in the later Middle Ages, it was mostly his ''[[Letters to Lucilius]]''—the longer essays and plays being relatively unknown.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wilson|2014|p=218}}</ref>

Medieval writers and works continued to link him to Christianity because of his alleged association with Paul.<ref name="wilko219">{{Harvnb|Wilson|2014|p=219}}</ref> The ''[[Golden Legend]]'', a 13th-century [[hagiography|hagiographical]] account of famous saints that was widely read, included an account of Seneca's death scene, and erroneously presented Nero as a witness to Seneca's suicide.<ref name="wilko219"/> [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] placed Seneca (alongside [[Cicero]]) among the "great spirits" in the [[Inferno (Dante)#First Circle (Limbo)|First Circle of Hell]], or [[Limbo]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Ker|2009|p=197}} citing Dante, ''Inf.'', 4.141</ref> [[Boccaccio]], who in 1370 came across the works of Tacitus whilst browsing the library at [[Montecassino]], wrote an account of Seneca's suicide hinting that it was a kind of disguised baptism, or a ''de facto'' baptism in spirit.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ker|2009|pp=221–22}}</ref> Some, such as [[Albertino Mussato]] and [[Giovanni Colonna (cardinal, 1295–1348)|Giovanni Colonna]], went even further and concluded that Seneca must have been a Christian convert.<ref>{{Harvnb|Laarmann|2013|p=59}}</ref>

===An improving reputation===
[[File:Seneca.JPG|thumb|upright|The "[[Pseudo-Seneca]]", a Roman bust found at [[Herculaneum]], one of a series of similar sculptures known since the Renaissance, once identified as Seneca. Now commonly identified as [[Hesiod]]]]

Seneca remains one of the few popular Roman philosophers from the period. He appears not only in [[Dante]], but also in [[Chaucer]] and to a large degree in [[Petrarch]], who adopted his style in his own essays and who quotes him more than any other authority except [[Virgil]]. In the [[Renaissance]], printed editions and translations of his works became common, including an edition by [[Erasmus]] and a commentary by [[John Calvin]].<ref name="Gummere">Richard Mott Gummere, ''Seneca the philosopher, and his modern message'', p. 97.</ref> [[John of Salisbury]], Erasmus and others celebrated his works. French essayist [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]], who gave a spirited defense of Seneca and [[Plutarch]] in his ''Essays'', was himself considered by [[Étienne Pasquier|Pasquier]] a "French Seneca".<ref>Gummere, ''Seneca the philosopher, and his modern message'', p. 106.</ref> Similarly, [[Thomas Fuller]] praised [[Joseph Hall (bishop)|Joseph Hall]] as "our English Seneca". Many who considered his ideas not particularly original, still argued that he was important in making the Greek philosophers presentable and intelligible.<ref>Moses Hadas. ''The Stoic Philosophy of Seneca'', 1958. 3.</ref> His suicide has also been a popular subject in art, from [[Jacques-Louis David]]'s 1773 painting ''[[The Death of Seneca (David)|The Death of Seneca]]'' to the 1951 film ''[[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|Quo Vadis]]''.

Even with the admiration of an earlier group of intellectual stalwarts, Seneca has never been without his detractors. In his own time, he was accused of hypocrisy or, at least, a less than "Stoic" lifestyle. While banished to Corsica, he wrote a plea for restoration rather incompatible with his advocacy of a simple life and the acceptance of fate. In his ''[[Apocolocyntosis]]'' he ridiculed the behaviours and policies of Claudius, and flattered Nero—such as proclaiming that Nero would live longer and be wiser than the legendary [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]]. The claims of [[Publius Suillius Rufus]] that Seneca acquired some "three hundred million ''[[sesterces]]''" through Nero's favour, are highly partisan, but they reflect the reality that Seneca was both powerful and wealthy.<ref name="campbell">{{Harvnb|Campbell|1969|p=11}}</ref> Robin Campbell, a translator of Seneca's letters, writes that the "stock criticism of Seneca right down the centuries [has been]...the apparent contrast between his philosophical teachings and his practice."<ref name="campbell"/>

In 1562 [[Gerolamo Cardano]] wrote an ''apology'' praising Nero in his ''Encomium Neronis'', printed in Basel.<ref>Available in English as Girolamo Cardano, ''Nero: an Exemplary Life'' Inkstone, 2012</ref> This was likely intended as a mock ''[[encomium]]'', inverting the portrayal of Nero and Seneca that appears in Tacitus.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Siraisi|first=Nancy G.|year=2007|title=History, Medicine, and the Traditions of Renaissance Learning|pages=157–58|publisher=University of Michigan Press}}</ref> In this work Cardano portrayed Seneca as a crook of the worst kind, an empty rhetorician who was only thinking to grab money and power, after having poisoned the mind of the young emperor. Cardano stated that Seneca well deserved death.

Among the historians who have sought to reappraise Seneca is the scholar Anna Lydia Motto who in 1966 argued that the negative image has been based almost entirely on Suillius' account, while many others who might have lauded him have been lost.<ref>Lydia Motto, Anna Seneca on Trial: The Case of the Opulent Stoic ''The Classic Journal'', Vol. 61, No. 6 (1966) pp. 254–58</ref>
<blockquote>"We are therefore left with no contemporary record of Seneca's life, save for the desperate opinion of Publius Suillius. Think of the barren image we should have of [[Socrates]], had the works of [[Plato]] and [[Xenophon]] not come down to us and were we wholly dependent upon [[Aristophanes]]' description of this Athenian philosopher. To be sure, we should have a highly distorted, misconstrued view. Such is the view left to us of Seneca, if we were to rely upon Suillius alone."<ref>Lydia Motto, Anna Seneca on Trial: The Case of the Opulent Stoic ''The Classic Journal'', Vol. 61, No. 6 (1966) p. 257</ref> </blockquote>

More recent work is changing the dominant perception of Seneca as a mere conduit for pre-existing ideas showing originality in Seneca's contribution to the [[history of ideas]]. Examination of Seneca's life and thought in relation to contemporary education and to the psychology of emotions is revealing the relevance of his thought. For example, [[Martha Nussbaum]] in her discussion of desire and emotion includes Seneca among the Stoics who offered important insights and perspectives on emotions and their role in our lives.<ref>Nussbaum, M. (1996). ''The Therapy of Desire''. Princeton University Press</ref> Specifically devoting a chapter to his treatment of anger and its management, she shows Seneca's appreciation of the damaging role of uncontrolled anger, and its pathological connections. Nussbaum later extended her examination to Seneca's contribution to [[political philosophy]]<ref>Nussbaum, M. (1999). ''Cultivating Humanity: A Classical Defense of Reform in Liberal Education''. [[Harvard University Press]]{{ISBN?}}{{page?|date=November 2021}}</ref> showing considerable subtlety and richness in his thoughts about politics, education, and notions of global citizenship—and finding a basis for reform-minded education in Seneca's ideas she used to propose a mode of modern education that avoids both narrow traditionalism and total rejection of tradition. Elsewhere Seneca has been noted as the first great Western thinker on the complex nature and role of gratitude in human relationships.<ref>Harpham, E. (2004). ''Gratitude in the History of Ideas'', 19–37 in M. A. Emmons and M. E. McCulloch, editors, The Psychology of Gratitude, Oxford University Press.</ref>

Seneca is a character in [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]]'s 1642 opera ''[[L'incoronazione di Poppea]]'' (''The Coronation of Poppea''), which is based on the pseudo-Senecan play, ''[[Octavia (play)|Octavia]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|author1-last=Gioia|author1-first=Dana|contribution=Introduction|title=Seneca: The Tragedies|editor1-last=Slavitt|editor1-first=David R.|year=1992|page=xviii|publisher=JHU Press}}</ref> In [[Nathaniel Lee]]'s 1675 play ''Nero, Emperor of Rome'', Seneca attempts to dissuade Nero from his egomaniacal plans, but is dragged off to prison, dying off-stage.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ker|2009|p=220}}</ref> He appears in [[Robert Bridges]]' verse drama ''Nero'', the second part of which (published 1894) culminates in Seneca's death.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bridges|first=Robert|title=Nero, Part II. From the death of Burrus to the death of Seneca, comprising the conspiracy of Piso|url=https://archive.org/details/nerofromdeathofb02bridrich|year=1894|publisher=George Bell and Sons}}</ref> Seneca appears in a fairly minor role in [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]]'s 1896 novel ''[[Quo Vadis (novel)|Quo Vadis]]'' and was played by [[Nicholas Hannen (actor)|Nicholas Hannen]] in [[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|the 1951 film]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Rome, season one: History makes television|first=Monica Silveira|last=Cyrino|page=195|year=2008|publisher=Blackwell}}</ref> In Robert Graves' 1934 book ''[[Claudius the God]]'', the sequel novel to ''[[I, Claudius]]'', Seneca is portrayed as an unbearable sycophant.<ref>{{Harvnb|Citti|2015|p=316}}</ref> He is shown as a flatterer who converts to Stoicism solely to appease Claudius' own ideology. The "Pumpkinification" (''Apocolocyntosis'') to Graves thus becomes an unbearable work of flattery to the loathsome Nero mocking a man that Seneca grovelled to for years. The historical novel ''Chariot of the Soul'' by [[Linda Proud]] features Seneca as tutor of the young Togidubnus, son of King Verica of the Atrebates, during his ten-year stay in Rome.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Chariot of the Soul|last=Proud|first=Linda|publisher=Godstow Press|year=2018|isbn=978-1907651137|location=Oxford|oclc=1054834598}}</ref>
