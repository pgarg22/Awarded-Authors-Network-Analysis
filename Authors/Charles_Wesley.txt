'''Charles Wesley''' (18 December 1707 – 29 March 1788) was an English leader of the [[Methodist]] movement, most widely known for writing the words for over 6,500 [[hymn]]s.<ref name="Hunton1917">{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/favoritehymnsst00huntgoog |pages=[https://archive.org/details/favoritehymnsst00huntgoog/page/n140 94]–97 |title=Favorite Hymns: Stories of the Origin, Authorship, and Use of Hymns We Love |first1=William Lee |last1=Hunton |date=1917 |publisher=General Council Publication House}}</ref> His works include "[[And Can It Be]]", "[[Christ the Lord Is Risen Today]]", the carol "[[Hark! The Herald Angels Sing]]", and "[[Lo! He Comes With Clouds Descending]]".

Charles Wesley was born in [[Epworth, Lincolnshire]], the son of [[Anglican cleric]] and poet [[Samuel Wesley (poet)|Samuel Wesley]] and his wife [[Susanna Wesley|Susanna]]. He was a younger brother of Methodist founder [[John Wesley]] and Anglican cleric [[Samuel Wesley (the Younger)|Samuel Wesley the Younger]], and he became the father of musician [[Samuel Wesley]] and grandfather of musician [[Samuel Sebastian Wesley]].

He was educated at [[Oxford University]], where his brothers had also studied, and he formed the "[[Holy Club]]" among his fellow students in 1729. John Wesley later joined this group, as did [[George Whitefield]]. Charles followed his father and brother into the church in 1735, and he travelled with John to [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]] in America, returning a year later. Following their [[Evangelical Revival|evangelical]] conversions in 1738, the Wesley brothers travelled throughout Britain, converting followers to the Methodist revival through preaching and hymn-singing. In 1749, he married [[Sarah Gwynne]], daughter of a Welsh gentleman who had been converted to Methodism by [[Howell Harris]]. From 1756 his ministry became more static and he ministered in [[Bristol]], and later [[London]].

Despite their closeness, Charles and John did not always agree on questions relating to their beliefs. In particular, Charles was strongly opposed to the idea of a breach with the [[Church of England]] into which they had been [[ordination|ordained]].<ref name=bbc>{{cite web|title=Charles Wesley|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/people/charleswesley_1.shtml|publisher=BBC|access-date=19 November 2013|date=6 August 2009}}</ref>

==Biography==
[[File:Charles wesley.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The 'Lily Portrait' of a young Charles Wesley, in the [[New Room, Bristol]]<ref name="Vickers2008"/>]]

===Early life===
Charles Wesley was the eighteenth child of [[Susanna Wesley]] and [[Samuel Wesley (poet)|Samuel Wesley]]. He was born in [[Epworth, England|Epworth]], Lincolnshire, England, where his father was [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]].<ref name=bbc/> In 1716, at the age of 8, he entered [[Westminster School]], where his brother Samuel was usher. He was selected as [[Queen's Scholar (Westminster School)|King's Scholar]] in 1721 and head boy in 1725–26, before matriculating at [[Christ Church, Oxford]].<ref name="Vickers2008">{{cite web |editor-last1=Vickers |editor-first1=John A. |title=Wesley, Charles |url=https://dmbi.online/index.php?do=app.entry&id=2944 |work=A Dictionary of Methodism in Britain and Ireland}}</ref>

At Oxford, Charles formed a prayer group among his fellow students in 1727; his elder brother, John, joined in 1729, soon becoming its leader and moulding it in line with his own convictions. They focused on studying the Bible and living a holy life. Other students mocked them, saying they were the "[[Holy Club]]", "Sacramentarians", and "the [[Methodism|Methodists]]", being methodical and exceptionally detailed in their Bible study, opinions and disciplined lifestyle.<ref name=bbc/> The Wesleys' future colleague, [[George Whitefield]] joined the group. Charles tutored while studying; he graduated in 1732 with a master's degree in classical languages and literature. Charles followed his father and brothers into [[Anglican orders]], being ordained as a [[priest]] in September 1735.<ref name="Vickers2008"/> That same year his father died.

===Voyage to America===
On 14 October 1735, Charles and his brother John sailed on ''The Simmonds'' from [[Gravesend, Kent]] for [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] in [[Province of Georgia|Georgia Colony]] in [[British America]] at the request of the governor, [[James Oglethorpe]]. Charles was appointed Secretary of Indian Affairs and while John remained in Savannah, Charles went as chaplain to the garrison and colony at nearby [[St. Simons, Georgia#Fort Frederica|Fort Frederica]], [[St. Simons, Georgia|St. Simon's Island]], arriving there Tuesday, 9 March 1736 according to his journal entry.<ref name="nnu.edu">

In July 1736, Charles was commissioned to England as the bearer of dispatches to the trustees of the colony. On 16 August 1736, he sailed from [[Charleston, South Carolina]], never to return to the Georgia colony.

===Ministry===
In 1738 the Wesley brothers had [[religious experiences]]: Charles experienced a conversion on 21 May, and John had a similar experience in [[Aldersgate Street]] just three days later. A City of London [[blue plaque]] at 13 [[Little Britain, London|Little Britain]], near the church of [[St Botolph's, Aldersgate]], off [[St. Martin's Le Grand]], marks the site of the former house of John Bray, reputed to be the scene of Charles' evangelical conversion. It reads, "Adjoining this site stood the house of John Bray. Scene of Charles Wesley's conversion by faith in Christ on May 21st 1738".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://openplaques.org/plaques/5300 |title=Plaque № 5300 |publisher=openplaques.org |access-date=4 March 2013}}</ref>

Charles felt renewed strength to spread [[the gospel]] to ordinary people and it was around then that he began to write the poetic hymns for which he would become known. In January 1739, he was appointed as [[curate]] to serve at [[St Mary's Church, Islington]], but was forced to resign when the churchwardens objected to his [[evangelical]] preaching.<ref name="mywesleyanmethodists"/> Later that same year, finding that they were unwelcome inside parish churches, the Wesley brothers took to preaching to crowds in open fields. They were influenced by George Whitefield, whose [[open-air preaching]] was already reaching great numbers of Bristol colliers.<ref name=bbc/> From 1740, John and Charles were the joint leaders of the [[Evangelical Revival|Methodist Revival]] and [[evangelism|evangelised]] throughout Britain and Ireland.<ref name=Cheetham2003>{{cite book |last1=Cheetham |first1=J.

In [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] Charles established its first Methodist society in September 1742, and he faced mob violence at [[Wednesbury]] and [[Sheffield]] in 1743 and at [[Devizes]] in 1747.<ref name="mywesleyanmethodists"/><ref name="Vickers2008"/>

Following a period of illness, after 1756 Charles made no more journeys to distant parts of the country, mainly just moving between Bristol and London.<ref name="Rack45_46">{{Cite book | last=Rack | first=Henry D. | editor1-last=Newport | editor1-first=Kenneth G.C. |editor2-last=Campbell | editor2-first=Ted A. | title=Charles Wesley: Life, Literature and Legacy | publisher=Epworth | location=Peterborough | year=2007  | isbn=9780716206071 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nWAmAQAAIAAJ}}</ref>{{rp|45-46}} Increasingly in his later years Charles became the mouthpiece of the so-called '[[Church of England|Church]] Methodists'—he was strongly opposed to a separation of Methodism from its Anglican roots.<ref name="Rack45_46" />{{rp|344–345}} In the 1780s, he was especially dismayed by his brother's [[ordination]] of priests to serve in America (''see {{slink|John Wesley|Ordination of ministers}}''), which he criticised in a published poem.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tomkins |first1=Stephen |title=John Wesley: A Biography |date=2003 |publisher=Lion |location=Oxford |isbn=0-7459-5078-7 |page=186}}</ref>

===Marriage and children===
[[File:Charles Wesley (4368240967).jpg|thumb|right|Plaque in Marylebone commemorating the site of Wesley's house (now a pub)]]
In April 1749, he married the much younger [[Sarah Wesley|Sarah Gwynne]] (1726–1822), also known as Sally.<ref name=Cheetham2003 />{{rp|95-97}} She was the daughter of [[Marmaduke Gwynne]], a wealthy [[Wales|Welsh]] magistrate who had been converted to Methodism by [[Howell Harris]].<ref name="Barry141_146">{{Cite book | last=Barry | first=Joseph | editor1-last=Temperley | editor1-first=Nicholas |editor2-last=Banfield | editor2-first=Stephen | title=Music and the Wesleys | publisher=University of Illinois Press | location=Urbana | year=2010 | pages=141–146 | isbn=978-0-252-07767-8}}</ref> They moved into a [[Charles Wesley's House|house at 4 Charles Street in Bristol]] in September 1749.<ref name="Vickers2008"/><ref name=Cheetham2003 />{{rp|95-97}} Sarah accompanied the brothers on their journeys throughout Britain, until at least 1753.

In 1771, Charles obtained another house, in London, and moved into it that year with his elder son. By 1778 the whole family had transferred from Bristol to the London house, at 1 Great Chesterfield Street (now Wheatley Street), [[Marylebone]],<ref name="Barry141_146"/> where they remained until Charles' death and on into the 19th&nbsp;century.<ref name="Forsaith161_162">{{Cite book | last=Forsaith | first=Peter S. | editor1-last=Temperley | editor1-first=Nicholas |editor2-last=Banfield | editor2-first=Stephen | title=Music and the Wesleys | publisher=University of Illinois Press | location=Urbana | year=2010 | pages=161–162 | isbn=978-0-252-07767-8}}</ref> The house in Bristol still stands and has been restored,<ref name=Cheetham2003 />{{rp|95-97}} however the London house was demolished in the mid 19th&nbsp;century.<ref name="Forsaith161_162"/>

Only three of the couple's children survived infancy: [[Charles Wesley junior]] (1757–1834), Sarah Wesley (1759–1828), who like her mother was also known as Sally, and [[Samuel Wesley]] (1766–1837).<ref name="Temperley_ix_xv">{{Cite book | last=Temperley | first=Nicholas | editor1-last=Temperley | editor1-first=Nicholas |editor2-last=Banfield | editor2-first=Stephen | title=Music and the Wesleys | publisher=University of Illinois Press | location=Urbana | year=2010 | pages=ix–xv | isbn=978-0-252-07767-8}}</ref> Their other children, John, Martha Maria, Susannah, Selina and John James are all buried in Bristol, having died between 1753 and 1768.

Both Samuel and Charles junior were musical [[child prodigies]] and, like their father, became [[organist]]s and composers. Charles junior spent most of his career as the personal organist of the Royal Family, and Samuel became one of the most accomplished musicians in the world and is often called "the English Mozart".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Blain |first1=Andrea |last2=Young |first2=Alison |title=Learning to Listen: Samuel Wesley, 'the English Mozart' |url=https://www.classicalmpr.org/story/2016/02/22/learning-to-listen-samuel-wesley-the-english-mozart |website=www.classicalmpr.org |access-date=1 February 2021}}</ref> Samuel Wesley's son, [[Samuel Sebastian Wesley]], was one of the foremost British composers of the 19th&nbsp;century.<ref name="Temperley_ix_xv"/>

===Death and burial===
[[File:Garden of Rest, Marylebone High Street 10.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Monument in St Marylebone Old Churchyard at the position of Wesley's original grave]]
On his deathbed he sent for the Rector of [[St Marylebone Parish Church]], John Harley, and purportedly told him "Sir, whatever the world may say of me, I have lived, and I die, a member of the Church of England. I pray you to bury me in your churchyard."

==Hymns and other works==

Charles Wesley was a prolific [[hymnwriter]]. Among the collections ([[hymnals]]) of Wesley's hymns published in his lifetime were ''Hymns on God's Everlasting Love'' (1741, 1742), ''Hymns on the [[Lord's Supper]]'' (1745), and ''Short Hymns on Select Passages of the Holy Scriptures'' (1762), together with others celebrating the major festivals of the [[Christian year]].<ref name="Vickers2008"/> His hymns are marked by their strong doctrinal content (notably the [[Arminian]] insistence on the [[unlimited atonement|universality of God's love]]),<ref name="Vickers2007"/> a richness of scriptural and literary allusion, and the variety of his [[metre (hymn)|metrical]] and stanza forms. They are considered to have had a significant influence not only on Methodism, but on Christian worship and modern theology as a whole.<ref name="Vickers2008"/><ref name="Vickers2007">{{cite book|last=Vickers|first=Jason E.|editor1-first=Kenneth G.

Wesley's poetry included [[epistles]], elegies and political and satirical verse. A collected edition of ''The Poetical Works of John and Charles Wesley'', edited by [[George Osborn]], was published in thirteen volumes in 1868–1872.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wesley |first1=John |title=A new and critical edition of George Osborn's The poetical works of John and Charles Wesley (1868–1872): with the addition of notes, annotations, biographical and background information.|volume=Volume 10, part 1 and 2 |date=2012 |publisher=Edwin Mellen Press |location=Lewiston, NY |isbn=0773426655}}</ref> Osborn's collection has now been supplemented by the three volumes of ''The Unpublished Poetry of Charles Wesley''.<ref name="Wesley1988">{{cite book|last=Wesley|first=Charles |title=The Unpublished Poetry of Charles Wesley|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HYhbAAAAMAAJ|volume=Volume 2|year=1988|publisher=Kingswood Books|isbn=978-0-687-43311-7}}</ref>

Jason E. Vickers states that Wesley's 'conversion experience' in 1738 had a clear impact on his doctrine, especially doctrine concerning the power of the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]]. The change was most prominent in his hymns written after the same year. From his published work ''Hymns and Prayers to the Trinity'' and in Hymn number 62 he writes "The Holy Ghost in part we know, For with us He resides, Our whole of good to Him we owe, Whom by His grace he guides, He doth our virtuous thoughts inspire, The evil he averts, And every seed of good desire, He planted in our hearts."<ref name=Vickers2008b>{{cite journal|last=Vickers|first= Jason E. |title='And We The Life of God Shall Know': Incarnation and the Trinity in Charles Wesley's Hymns|journal= Anglican Theological Review |volume=90|issue=2 |date=2008b|pages= 329–344|url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/f3f126e2a13c5fee6d7fdfa9b6996276/}}</ref> Charles communicates several doctrines: the personal indwelling of the Holy Spirit, the [[sanctification|sanctifying work]] of the Spirit, the [[total depravity|depravity]] of mankind, and humanity's personal accountability to God.<ref name="Vickers2007"/>

===Hymnody===
In the course of his career, Wesley published the words of between 6,500 and 10,000 [[hymn]]s,<ref name="Hunton1917"/><ref name="Vickers2008"/> many of which are still popular. These include:

The words to many more of Charles Wesley's hymns can be found on [[Wikisource]] and in his many publications.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/hymnsandsacredpo00wesliala|title= Hymns and sacred poems|last1= Wesley|first1= John |last2=Wesley|first2= Charles|location= Bristol|date= 1743|edition=4th}}</ref><ref>[https://divinity.duke.edu/initiatives/cswt/charles-published-verse Complete texts of Charles Wesley's Published Verse at Duke Divinity School]</ref>

Some 150 of his hymns are in the Methodist hymn book ''[[Hymns and Psalms]]'', including "Hark! the Herald Angels Sing", and ''The Church Hymn Book'' (In New York and Chicago, US, 1872) where "Jesus, Lover of My Soul" is published. Many of his hymns are translated into other languages, and form the foundation for Methodist hymnals, as well as the Swedish ''Metodist-Episkopal-Kyrkans Psalmbok'' printed in Stockholm in 1892.

=== Psalms ===
Wesley's hymns are notable as interpretations of Scripture.<ref name="LeMon">{{youtube|id=1FNv_dY7h6A|title=Joel M. LeMon: The Controversial Introduction of Jesus into the Psalms by John and Charles Wesley}}</ref> He also produced paraphrases of the [[Psalms]], contributing to the long tradition of English [[metrical psalter|metrical Psalmody]]. A notable feature of his Psalms is the introduction of Jesus into the Psalms, continuing a tradition of Christological readings of the Psalms evident in the translations of John Patrick and [[Isaac Watts]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = The English Hymn|last = Watson|first = J. R.|publisher = Clarendon Press|year = 1997|isbn = 0198267622|location = Oxford|pages = [https://archive.org/details/englishhymncriti0000wats/page/230 230–251]|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/englishhymncriti0000wats/page/230}}</ref> The introduction of Jesus into the Psalms was often the source of controversy, even within Wesley's own family. Charles' brother Samuel Wesley wrote a poem against such practice.<ref name="LeMon" /> Of particular importance is Wesley's manuscript Psalms, held in the archives of the Pitts Theology Library at [[Emory University]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pitts.emory.edu/archives/text/mss159.html|title=Pitts Theology Library Archives Finding Aid}}</ref>

Wesley is still remembered for his ministry while in [[St. Simons, Georgia|St. Simon's Island]], Georgia, by the South Georgia Conference of the [[United Methodist Church]]; in 1950, the conference opened a Christian retreat center on the island by the banks of the [[Frederica River]], designating it [[Epworth by the Sea]] in honour of his and John's birthplace.

He is commemorated in the [[Calendar of Saints (Lutheran)|Calendar of Saints]] of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] on 2 March with his brother John.
