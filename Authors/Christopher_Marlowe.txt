'''Christopher Marlowe''', also known as '''Kit Marlowe''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɑr|l|oʊ}}; [[Baptism|baptised]] 26 February 1564{{spaced ndash}}30 May 1593), was an English [[playwright]], [[poet]] and [[Translation|translator]] of the [[Elizabethan era]].{{refn|group=nb|"Christopher Marlowe was [[Baptism|baptised]] as 'Marlow,' but he spelled his name 'Marley' in his one known surviving signature."<ref name="Kathman 2">{{cite web |last1=Kathman |first1=David |title=The Spelling and Pronunciation of Shakespeare's Name: Pronunciation |url=http://shakespeareauthorship.com/name1.html#3 |website=shakespeareauthorship.com |access-date=14 Jun 2020}}</ref>}}  Marlowe is among the most famous of the [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan]] playwrights. Based upon the "many imitations" of his play ''[[Tamburlaine]],'' modern [[scholar]]s  consider him to have been the foremost [[dramatist]] in [[London]] in the years just before his mysterious early death.{{refn|group=nb|"During Marlowe's lifetime, the popularity of his plays, Robert Greene's unintentionally elevating remarks about him as a dramatist in ''A Groatsworth of Wit'', including the designation “famous,” and the many imitations of ''Tamburlaine'' suggest that he was for a brief time considered England's foremost dramatist." Logan also suggests consulting the business diary of Philip Henslowe, which is traditionally used by theatre historians to determine the popularity of Marlowe's plays.<ref name="Logan 2">{{cite book |last1=Logan |first1=Robert A. |title=Shakespeare's Marlowe: the influence of Christopher Marlowe on Shakespeare's artistry |date=2007 |publisher=Ashgate |location=Aldershot, England; Burlington, VT |isbn=978-0754657637 |pages=4–5, 21}}</ref>}} Some scholars also believe that he greatly influenced [[William Shakespeare]], who was [[baptised]] in the same year as Marlowe and later succeeded him as the pre-eminent [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan]] playwright.{{refn|group=nb|No birth records, only baptismal records, have been found for Marlowe and [[Shakespeare]], therefore any reference to a birthdate for either man probably refers to the date of their baptism.{{sfnp|Logan|2007|p=3, 231-235}}}} Marlowe was the first to achieve critical reputation for his use of [[blank verse]], which became the standard for the era. His plays are distinguished by their overreaching [[protagonist]]s. Themes found within Marlowe's [[literary]] works have been noted as [[humanistic]] with realistic emotions, which some scholars find difficult to reconcile with Marlowe's "[[anti-intellectualism]]" and his catering to the prurient tastes of his Elizabethan audiences for generous displays of extreme physical violence, cruelty, and bloodshed.<ref name="Wilson p3">{{cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=Richard |title=Christopher Marlowe |editor=Wilson, Richard |date=1999 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=London, New York |page=3 |chapter=Introduction}}</ref>

Events in Marlowe's life were sometimes as extreme as those found in his plays.{{refn|group=nb|"…as one of the most influential current critics, Stephen Greenblatt frets, Marlowe's 'cruel, aggressive plays' seem to reflect a life also lived on the edge: 'a courting of disaster as reckless as any that he depicted on stage'."{{sfnp|Wilson|1999|p=4}}}} Differing sensational reports of Marlowe's death in 1593 abounded after the event and are contested by scholars today owing to a lack of good [[Documentation of cultural property|documentation]]. There have been many [[Conjecture (textual criticism)|conjectures]] as to the nature and reason for his death, including a vicious bar-room fight, [[blasphemous libel]] against the church, [[homosexual]] intrigue, betrayal by another [[playwright]], and [[espionage]] from the highest level: the [[Privy Council of England|Privy Council]] of [[Elizabeth I]]. An official [[coroner]]'s account of Marlowe's death was only revealed in 1925,<ref name="rey.myzen.co.uk">For a full transcript, see [http://www.rey.myzen.co.uk/inquis~2.htm Peter Farey's Marlowe page] (Retrieved 30 April 2015).</ref> but it did little to persuade all scholars that it told the whole story, nor did it eliminate the uncertainties present in his [[biography]].<ref>Erne, Lukas, (2005) "Biography, Mythography, and Criticism: The Life and Works of Christopher Marlowe," ''Modern Philology'', Vol. 103, No. 1, University of Chicago Press (August 2005), pp. 28-50.</ref>

==Early life==

By age 14, Marlowe attended [[The King's School, Canterbury|The King's School]], Canterbury on scholarship{{refn|group=nb|The earliest record of Marlowe at The King's School is their payment for his scholarship of 1578/79, but Nicholl notes this was "unusually late" to start as a student and proposes he could have begun school earlier as a "fee-paying pupil".<ref name="Nicholl"/>}} and two years later [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], where he also studied on scholarship and received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1584.<ref name="Nicholl"/><ref>{{acad|id=MRLW580C|name=Marlowe, Christopher}}</ref> Marlowe mastered [[Latin language|Latin]] during his schooling; reading and translating the works of [[Ovid]].

[[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre|Large-scale violence]] between [[Protestants]] and [[Catholics]] on the European continent has been cited by scholars as the impetus for the [[Elizabeth I|Protestant English Queen]]'s defensive [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement|anti-Catholic laws]] issued from 1581 until her death in 1603.<ref name="Collinson"/> Despite the dire implications for Marlowe, his degree was awarded on schedule when the [[Privy Council of England|Privy Council]] intervened on his behalf, commending him for his "faithful dealing" and "good service" to [[Elizabeth I|the Queen]].<ref>For a full transcript, see [http://www.rey.myzen.co.uk/pc_cert.htm Peter Farey's Marlowe page] (Retrieved 30 April 2015).</ref> The nature of Marlowe's service was not specified by the Council, but its letter to the Cambridge authorities has provoked much speculation by modern scholars, notably the theory that Marlowe was operating as a secret agent for Privy Council member Sir [[Francis Walsingham]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Hutchinson |first=Robert |title=Elizabeth's Spy Master: Francis Walsingham and the Secret War that Saved England |publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson |year=2006 |location=London |page=111 |isbn =978-0-297-84613-0}}</ref> The only surviving evidence of the Privy Council's correspondence is found in their minutes, the letter being lost. There is no mention of [[espionage]] in the minutes, but its summation of the lost Privy Council letter is vague in meaning, stating that "it was not Her Majesties pleasure" that persons employed as Marlowe had been "in matters touching the benefit of his country should be defamed by those who are ignorant in th'affaires he went about." Scholars agree the vague wording was typically used to protect government agents, but they continue to debate what the "matters touching the benefit of his country" actually were in Marlowe's case and how they affected the 23-year-old writer as he launched his literary career in 1587.<ref name="Nicholl"/> 

==Adult life and legend==
As with other Elizabethans, little is known about Marlowe's adult life. All available evidence, other than what can be deduced from his literary works, is found in legal records and other official documents. This has not stopped writers of fiction and non-fiction from speculating about his professional activities, private life and character. Marlowe has often been described as a spy, a brawler and a heretic, as well as a "magician", "duellist", "tobacco-user", "counterfeiter" and "[[Rake (character)|rakehell]]". While J. A. Downie and Constance Kuriyama have argued against the more lurid speculations, it is the usually circumspect [[J. B. Steane]] who remarked, "it seems absurd to dismiss all of these Elizabethan rumours and accusations as 'the Marlowe myth{{'"}}.<ref name="Kuriyama">{{cite book |last1=Kuriyama |first1=Constance |title=Christopher Marlowe: A Renaissance Life |date=2002 |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca |isbn=0801439787}}</ref><ref>Downie, J. A. and J. T. Parnell. ''Constructing Christopher Marlowe'' (2000)</ref><ref name="steane"/> To understand his brief adult life, from 1587 to 1593, much has been written, including speculation of: his involvement in royally sanctioned espionage; his vocal declaration as an atheist; his private, and possibly same-sex, sexual interests; and the puzzling circumstances surrounding his death.

[[File:OldCurtCC.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The corner of Old Court of [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], where Marlowe stayed while a Cambridge student and, possibly, during the time he was recruited as a spy]] 

===Spying===
Marlowe is alleged to have been a government spy.<ref name="Honan">{{cite book |last1=Honan |first1=Park |title=Christopher Marlowe: Poet and Spy |date=2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, New York |isbn=0198186959}}</ref> [[Park Honan]] and [[Charles Nicholl (author)|Charles Nicholl]] speculate that this was the case and suggest that Marlowe's recruitment took place when he was at Cambridge.{{sfnp|Honan|2005}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Nicholl|first=Charles|title=The Reckoning: The Murder of Christopher Marlowe|url=https://archive.org/details/reckoningmurdero0000nich|url-access=registration|publisher=Jonathan Cape|location=London |year=1992|chapter=12|isbn=978-0-224-03100-4}}</ref> In 1587, when the Privy Council ordered the University of Cambridge to award Marlowe his degree as Master of Arts, it denied rumours that he intended to go to the English Catholic college in Rheims, saying instead that he had been engaged in unspecified "affaires" on "matters touching the benefit of his country".<ref>This is from a document dated 29 June 1587, from the National Archives – ''Acts of Privy Council''.</ref> Surviving college records from the period also indicate that, in the academic year 1584–1585, Marlowe had had a series of unusually lengthy absences from the university which violated university regulations. Surviving college [[Buttery (shop)|buttery]] accounts, which record student purchases for personal provisions, show that Marlowe began spending lavishly on food and drink during the periods he was in attendance; the amount was more than he could have afforded on his known scholarship income.{{sfnp|Nicholl|1992}}{{refn|group=nb|It is known that some poorer students worked as labourers on the Corpus Christi College chapel, then under construction, and were paid by the college with extra food. It has been suggested this may be the reason for the sums noted in Marlowe's entry in the buttery accounts.<ref name="Riggs2004">{{cite book|author=David Riggs|title=The World of Christopher Marlowe|page=65|year=2004|publisher=Faber|isbn=978-0-571-22159-2}}</ref>}}

[[File:Sir Francis Walsingham by John De Critz the Elder.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Portrait of alleged "spymaster" Sir [[Francis Walsingham]] ''c.'' 1585; attributed to [[John de Critz]]]]
It has been speculated that Marlowe was the "Morley" who was tutor to [[Arbella Stuart]] in 1589.<ref>He was described by Arbella's guardian, the Countess of Shrewsbury, as having hoped for an annuity of some £40 from Arbella, his being "so much damnified (i.e. having lost this much) by leaving the University.": British Library [[Lansdowne MS.]] 71, f.3. and Nicholl, (1992), pp. 340–2.</ref> This possibility was first raised in a ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'' letter by E. St John Brooks in 1937; in a letter to ''[[Notes and Queries]]'', John Baker has added that only Marlowe could have been Arbella's tutor owing to the absence of any other known "Morley" from the period with an MA and not otherwise occupied.<ref>John Baker, letter to ''Notes and Queries'' 44.3 (1997), pp. 367–8</ref> If Marlowe was Arbella's tutor, it might indicate that he was there as a spy, since Arbella, niece of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], and cousin of James VI of Scotland, later [[James I of England]], was at the time a strong candidate for the [[succession to Elizabeth's throne]].{{sfnp|Kuriyama|2002|p=89}}{{sfnp|Nicholl|1992|p=342}}<ref name="Handover">{{cite book |last1=Handover |first1=P.

Boas]] dismisses the possibility of this identification, based on surviving legal records which document Marlowe's "residence in London between September and December 1589". Marlowe had been party to a fatal quarrel involving his neighbours and the poet [[Thomas Watson (poet)|Thomas Watson]] in [[Norton Folgate]] and was held in [[Newgate Prison]] for a fortnight.<ref>Frederick S. Boas,'' Christopher Marlowe: A biographical and critical study'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1953), pp. 101ff.</ref> In fact, the quarrel and his arrest occurred on 18 September, he was released on bail on 1 October and he had to attend court, where he was acquitted on 3 December, but there is no record of where he was for the intervening two months.{{sfnp|Kuriyama|2002|p=xvi}}

In 1592 Marlowe was arrested in the English [[Cautionary Towns|garrison town]] of [[Flushing, Netherlands|Flushing]] (Vlissingen) in the Netherlands, for alleged involvement in the [[Counterfeit money|counterfeiting]] of coins, presumably related to the activities of seditious Catholics. He was sent to the Lord Treasurer ([[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Burghley]]), but no charge or imprisonment resulted.<ref>For a full transcript, see [http://www.rey.myzen.co.uk/flushing.htm Peter Farey's Marlowe page] (Retrieved 30 April 2015).</ref> This arrest may have disrupted another of Marlowe's spying missions, perhaps by giving the resulting coinage to the Catholic cause. He was to infiltrate the followers of the active Catholic plotter [[William Stanley (Elizabethan)|William Stanley]] and report back to Burghley.{{sfnp|Nicholl|1992|pp=246-248}}

===Philosophy===
[[File:Sir Walter Ralegh by 'H' monogrammist.jpg|thumb|200px|Sir [[Walter Raleigh]], shown here in 1588, was the alleged centre of the [[The School of Night|"School of Atheism"]] ''c.'' 1592.]]
Marlowe was reputed to be an [[atheist]], which held the dangerous implication of being an enemy of God and the state, by association.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stanley|first=Thomas|author-link=Thomas Stanley (author)|title=The History of Philosophy 1655–61|publisher=quoted in [[Oxford English Dictionary]]|year=1687}}</ref> With the rise of public fears concerning [[The School of Night]], or "School of Atheism" in the late 16th century, accusations of atheism were closely associated with disloyalty to the Protestant monarchy of England.<ref>{{cite book|last1 = Riggs|first1 = David|title = The World of Christopher Marlowe|date = 5 January 2005|publisher = Henry Holt and Co.|isbn = 978-0805077551|edition = 1|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hYhWAgAAQBAJ&q=atheism&pg=PP2|access-date = 3 November 2015|pages = 294}}</ref>

Some modern historians consider that Marlowe's professed atheism, as with his supposed Catholicism, may have been no more than a sham to further his work as a government spy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Riggs|first=David|title=The Cambridge Companion to Christopher Marlowe|url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgecompani00chen_319|url-access=limited|editor=Cheney, Patrick|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|year=2004|page=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgecompani00chen_319/page/n56 38]|isbn=978-0-521-52734-7}}</ref> Contemporary evidence comes from Marlowe's accuser in [[Flushing, Netherlands|Flushing]], an informer called [[Richard Baines]]. The governor of Flushing had reported that each of the men had "of malice" accused the other of instigating the counterfeiting and of intending to go over to the Catholic "enemy"; such an action was considered atheistic by the [[Church of England]]. Following Marlowe's arrest in 1593, Baines submitted to the authorities a "note containing the opinion of one Christopher Marly concerning his damnable judgment of religion, and scorn of God's word".<ref>For a full transcript, see [http://www.rey.myzen.co.uk/baines1.htm Peter Farey's Marlowe page] (Retrieved 30 April 2012).</ref> Baines attributes to Marlowe a total of eighteen items which "scoff at the pretensions of the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]" such as, "Christ was a bastard and his mother dishonest [unchaste]", "the woman of Samaria and her sister were whores and that Christ knew them dishonestly", "St [[John the Evangelist]] was bedfellow to Christ and leaned always in his bosom" (cf. John 13:23–25) and "that he used him as the sinners of [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]]".<ref name="steane">{{cite book|last=Steane|first=J.

Other passages are merely sceptical in tone: "he persuades men to atheism, willing them not to be afraid of [[bugbear]]s and [[hobgoblins]]". The final paragraph of Baines's document reads:

[[File:ThomasHarriot.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Portrait often claimed to be [[Thomas Harriot]] (1602), which hangs in [[Trinity College, Oxford]]]]
{{quote|These thinges, with many other shall by good & honest witnes be approved to be his opinions and Comon Speeches, and that this Marlowe doth not only hould them himself, but almost into every Company he Cometh he persuades men to Atheism willing them not to be afeard of bugbeares and hobgoblins, and vtterly scorning both god and his ministers as I Richard Baines will Justify & approue both by mine oth and the testimony of many honest men, and almost al men with whome he hath Conversed any time will testify the same, and as I think all men in Cristianity ought to indevor that the mouth of so dangerous a member may be stopped, he saith likewise that he hath quoted a number of Contrarieties oute of the Scripture which he hath giuen to some great men who in Convenient time shalbe named.

Similar examples of Marlowe's statements were given by [[Thomas Kyd]] after his imprisonment and possible torture (see above); Kyd and Baines connect Marlowe with the mathematician [[Thomas Harriot]]'s and Sir [[Walter Raleigh]]'s circle.<ref name="Peter Farey's Marlowe page"/> Another document claimed about that time that "one Marlowe is able to show more sound reasons for Atheism than any divine in England is able to give to prove divinity, and that ... he hath read the Atheist lecture to Sir Walter Raleigh and others".<ref name="steane"/><ref>The so-called 'Remembrances' against Richard Cholmeley. For a full transcript, see [http://www.rey.myzen.co.uk/chumley1.htm Peter Farey's Marlowe page]. (Retrieved 30 April 2015)</ref>

Some critics believe that Marlowe sought to disseminate these views in his work and that he identified with his rebellious and iconoclastic protagonists.<ref>Waith, Eugene. ''The Herculean Hero in Marlowe, Chapman, Shakespeare, and Dryden''. Chatto and Windus, London, 1962. The idea is commonplace, though by no means universally accepted.</ref> Plays had to be approved by the [[Master of the Revels]] before they could be performed and the censorship of publications was under the control of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Presumably these authorities did not consider any of Marlowe's works to be unacceptable other than the ''Amores''.

===Sexuality===
[[File:Hero-und-Leander.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.70|Title page to 1598 edition of Marlowe's ''Hero and Leander'']]
It has been claimed that Marlowe was homosexual. Some scholars argue that the identification of an Elizabethan as gay or homosexual in the modern sense is "anachronistic," claiming that for the Elizabethans the terms were more likely to have been applied to sexual acts rather than to what we currently understand to be exclusive sexual orientations and identities.<ref>{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Bruce R.|title=Homosexual desire in Shakespeare's England|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, Illinois|date=March 1995|page=74|isbn=978-0-226-76366-8}}</ref> Other scholars argue that the evidence is inconclusive and that the reports of Marlowe's homosexuality may be rumours produced after his death. Richard Baines reported Marlowe as saying: "all they that love not Tobacco & Boies were fools". [[David Bevington]] and [[Eric C. Rasmussen]] describe Baines's evidence as "unreliable testimony" and "These and other testimonials need to be discounted for their exaggeration and for their having been produced under legal circumstances we would now regard as a witch-hunt".<ref>''Doctor Faustus and Other Plays'', pp. viii–ix</ref>

[[J. B. Steane]] remarked that he considered there to be "no evidence for Marlowe's homosexuality at all".<ref name="steane"/> Other scholars point to the frequency with which Marlowe explores homosexual themes in his writing: in ''[[Hero and Leander (poem)|Hero and Leander]]'', Marlowe writes of the male youth Leander: "in his looks were all that men desire..."<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=White |editor-first=Paul Whitfield |title=Marlowe, History and Sexuality: New Critical Essays on Christopher Marlowe |publisher=AMS Press |location=New York |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-404-62335-7}}</ref><ref>''Hero and Leander'', 88 (see [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/21262/21262-h/21262-h.htm Project Gutenberg]).</ref><ref>''Hero and Leander'', 157–192.</ref><ref>''Hero and Leander'', 192–193.</ref> ''[[Edward II (play)|Edward the Second]]'' contains the following passage enumerating homosexual relationships:

}}

Marlowe wrote the only [[Edward II (play)|play]] about the life of [[Edward II]] up to his time, taking the [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] literary discussion of male sexuality much further than his contemporaries. The play was extremely bold, dealing with a star-crossed love story between Edward II and [[Piers Gaveston, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Piers Gaveston]]. Though it was a common practice at the time to reveal characters as gay to give audiences reason to suspect them as culprits in a crime, Christopher Marlowe's Edward II is portrayed as a sympathetic character.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Edward the Second|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=axTzkFP9IHoC|publisher = Manchester University Press|date = 15 October 1995|isbn = 9780719030895|first1 = Christopher|last1 = Marlowe|first2 = Charles R.|last2 = Forker}}</ref> The decision to start the play ''[[Dido, Queen of Carthage (play)|Dido, Queen of Carthage]]'' with a homoerotic scene between [[Zeus]] and [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]] that bears no connection to the subsequent plot has long puzzled scholars.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Deanne|date=2006|title=Dido, Queen of England|journal=ELH|volume=73|issue=1|pages=31–59|doi=10.1353/elh.2006.0010|jstor=30030002|s2cid=153554373}}</ref>

===Arrest and death===
[[File:marlowe.jpg|thumb|Marlowe was buried in an unmarked grave in the churchyard of St Nicholas, [[Deptford]]. This modern plaque is on the east wall of the churchyard.]]
In early May 1593, several bills were posted about London threatening Protestant refugees from France and the Netherlands who had settled in the city. One of these, the "Dutch church libel", written in rhymed [[iambic pentameter]], contained allusions to several of Marlowe's plays and was signed, "[[Tamburlaine]]".<ref>For a full transcript, see [http://www.rey.myzen.co.uk/libell.htm Peter Farey's Marlowe page] (Retrieved 31 March 2012).</ref> On 11 May the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] ordered the arrest of those responsible for the libels. The next day, Marlowe's colleague [[Thomas Kyd]] was arrested, his lodgings were searched and a three-page fragment of a [[heresy|heretical]] tract was found. In a letter to Sir [[John Puckering]], Kyd asserted that it had belonged to Marlowe, with whom he had been writing "in one chamber" some two years earlier.<ref name="Peter Farey's Marlowe page">For a full transcript of Kyd's letter, see [http://www.rey.myzen.co.uk/kyd2.htm Peter Farey's Marlowe page] (Retrieved 30 April 2015).</ref><ref>J. R. Mulryne states in his ''ODNB'' article that the document was identified in the 20th century as transcripts from John Proctour's ''The Fall of the Late Arian'' (1549).</ref> In a second letter, Kyd described Marlowe as blasphemous, disorderly, holding treasonous opinions, being an irreligious reprobate and "intemperate & of a cruel hart".<ref name=ODNB/> They had both been working for an [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] patron, probably [[Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby|Ferdinando Stanley]], Lord Strange.<ref name=ODNB>Mulryne, J. R. "Thomas Kyd." ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]''. Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], 2004.</ref> A warrant for Marlowe's arrest was issued on 18 May, when the Privy Council apparently knew that he might be found staying with [[Thomas Walsingham (literary patron)|Thomas Walsingham]], whose father was a first cousin of the late Sir [[Francis Walsingham]], Elizabeth's [[Secretary of State (England)|principal secretary]] in the 1580s and a man more deeply involved in state espionage than any other member of the Privy Council.<ref>Haynes, Alan. ''The Elizabethan Secret Service''. London: Sutton, 2005.</ref> Marlowe duly presented himself on 20 May but there apparently being no Privy Council meeting on that day, was instructed to "give his daily attendance on their Lordships, until he shall be licensed to the contrary".<ref>National Archives, ''Acts of the Privy Council''. Meetings of the Privy Council, including details of those attending, are recorded and minuted for 16, 23, 25, 29 and the morning of 31 May, all of them taking place in the Star Chamber at Westminster. There is no record of any meeting on either 18 or 20 May, however, just a note of the warrant being issued on 18 May and the fact that Marlowe "entered his appearance for his indemnity therein" on the 20th.</ref> On Wednesday, 30 May, Marlowe was killed.

[[File:Palladis Tamia 1598.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Title page to the 1598 edition of ''[[Palladis Tamia]]'' by [[Francis Meres]], which contains one of the earliest descriptions of Marlowe's death]]
Various accounts of Marlowe's death were current over the next few years. In his ''[[Palladis Tamia]]'', published in 1598, [[Francis Meres]] says Marlowe was "stabbed to death by a bawdy serving-man, a rival of his in his lewd love" as punishment for his "epicurism and atheism".<ref>''Palladis Tamia''. London, 1598: 286v-287r.</ref> In 1917, in the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Sir [[Sidney Lee]] wrote that Marlowe was killed in a drunken fight and this is still often stated as fact today. The official account came to light only in 1925, when the scholar [[Leslie Hotson]] discovered the [[coroner]]'s report of the inquest on Marlowe's death, held two days later on Friday 1 June 1593, by the [[Coroner of the Queen's Household]], [[William Danby (coroner)|William Danby]].<ref name="rey.myzen.co.uk"/> Marlowe had spent all day in a house in [[Deptford, London|Deptford]], owned by the widow [[Eleanor Bull]] and together with three men: [[Ingram Frizer]], [[Nicholas Skeres]] and [[Robert Poley]]. All three had been employed by one or other of the Walsinghams. Skeres and Poley had helped snare the conspirators in the [[Babington plot]] and Frizer would later describe [[Thomas Walsingham (literary patron)|Thomas Walsingham]] as his "master" at that time, although his role was probably more that of a financial or business agent, as he was for Walsingham's wife [[Audrey Walsingham|Audrey]] a few years later.<ref>Leslie Hotson, ''The Death of Christopher Marlowe'' (1925) p.65</ref>{{sfnp|Honan|2005|p=325}} These witnesses testified that Frizer and Marlowe had argued over payment of the bill (now famously known as the 'Reckoning') exchanging "divers malicious words" while Frizer was sitting at a table between the other two and Marlowe was lying behind him on a couch. Marlowe snatched Frizer's dagger and wounded him on the head. In the ensuing struggle, according to the coroner's report, Marlowe was stabbed above the right eye, killing him instantly. The jury concluded that Frizer acted in self-defence and within a month he was pardoned. Marlowe was buried in an unmarked grave in the churchyard of St. Nicholas, Deptford immediately after the inquest, on 1 June 1593.<ref>Wilson, Scott. ''Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons'', 3d ed.: 2 (Kindle Location 30125). McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers. Kindle Edition</ref>

The complete text of the inquest report was published by Leslie Hotson in his book, ''The Death of Christopher Marlowe'', in the introduction to which Prof. [[George Lyman Kittredge|George Kittredge]] said "The mystery of Marlowe's death, heretofore involved in a cloud of contradictory gossip and irresponsible guess-work, is now cleared up for good and all on the authority of public records of complete authenticity and gratifying fullness" but this confidence proved fairly short-lived. Hotson had considered the possibility that the witnesses had "concocted a lying account of Marlowe's behaviour, to which they swore at the inquest, and with which they deceived the jury" but came down against that scenario.<ref>Hotson (1925) pp.39–40</ref> Others began to suspect that this was indeed the case. Writing to the ''TLS'' shortly after the book's publication, Eugénie de Kalb disputed that the struggle and outcome as described were even possible and [[Samuel A. Tannenbaum]] insisted the following year that such a wound could not have possibly resulted in instant death, as had been claimed.<ref>de Kalb, Eugénie (May 1925). "The Death of Marlowe", in ''The Times Literary Supplement''</ref><ref>Tannenbaum, Samuel (1926). ''The Assassination of Christopher Marlowe'', New York, pp.41–42</ref> Even Marlowe's biographer John Bakeless acknowledged that "some scholars have been inclined to question the truthfulness of the coroner's report. There is something queer about the whole episode" and said that Hotson's discovery "raises almost as many questions as it answers".<ref>Bakeless, John (1942). ''The Tragicall History of Christopher Marlowe'', p.182</ref> It has also been discovered more recently that the apparent absence of a local county coroner to accompany the Coroner of the Queen's Household would, if noticed, have made the inquest null and void.{{sfnp|Honan|2005|p=354}}

One of the main reasons for doubting the truth of the inquest concerns the reliability of Marlowe's companions as witnesses.<ref>Nicholl, Charles (2004). "Marlowe [Marley], Christopher", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18079 online edn], January 2008. Retrieved 24 August 2013. "The authenticity of the inquest is not in doubt, but whether it tells the full truth is another matter. The nature of Marlowe's companions raises questions about their reliability as witnesses."</ref> As an ''agent provocateur'' for the late Sir Francis Walsingham, Robert Poley was a consummate liar, the "very genius of the Elizabethan underworld" and is on record as saying "I will swear and forswear myself, rather than I will accuse myself to do me any harm".<ref>Boas (1953), p.293</ref><ref>Nicholl (2002), p.38</ref> The other witness, Nicholas Skeres, had for many years acted as a confidence trickster, drawing young men into the clutches of people in the money-lending racket, including Marlowe's apparent killer, Ingram Frizer, with whom he was engaged in such a swindle.<ref>Nicholl (2002), pp.29–30</ref> Despite their being referred to as "generosi" (gentlemen) in the inquest report, the witnesses were professional liars. Some biographers, such as Kuriyama and Downie, take the inquest to be a true account of what occurred but in trying to explain what really happened if the account was ''not'' true, others have come up with a variety of murder theories.<ref>Kuriyama (2002), p.136</ref><ref>Downie, J.

Since there are only written documents on which to base any conclusions and since it is probable that the most crucial information about his death was never committed to paper, it is unlikely that the full circumstances of Marlowe's death will ever be known.

}}
For his contemporaries in the literary world, Marlowe was above all an admired and influential artist. Within weeks of his death, [[George Peele]] remembered him as "Marley, the Muses' darling"; [[Michael Drayton]] noted that he "Had in him those brave translunary things / That the first poets had" and [[Ben Jonson]] wrote of "Marlowe's mighty line". [[Thomas Nashe]] wrote warmly of his friend, "poor deceased Kit Marlowe," as did the publisher Edward Blount in his dedication of ''Hero and Leander'' to Sir Thomas Walsingham. Among the few contemporary dramatists to say anything negative about Marlowe was the anonymous author of the Cambridge University play ''[[Parnassus plays|The Return from Parnassus]]'' (1598) who wrote, "Pity it is that wit so ill should dwell, / Wit lent from heaven, but vices sent from hell".

The most famous tribute to Marlowe was paid by [[Shakespeare]] in ''[[As You Like It]]'', where he not only quotes a line from ''[[Hero and Leander (poem)|Hero and Leander]]'' ("Dead Shepherd, now I find thy saw of might, 'Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?{{'"}}) but also gives to the clown [[Touchstone (As You Like It)|Touchstone]] the words "When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a man's good wit seconded with the forward child, understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room".<ref>Peter Alexander ed., ''William Shakespeare: The Complete Works'' (London 1962) p. 273</ref> This appears to be a reference to Marlowe's murder which involved a fight over the "reckoning", the bill, as well as to a line in Marlowe's ''Jew of Malta''; "Infinite riches in a little room".

}}
Shakespeare was much influenced by Marlowe in his work, as can be seen in the use of Marlovian themes in ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'', ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'' and ''[[Macbeth]]'' (''Dido'', ''Jew of Malta'', ''Edward II'' and ''Doctor Faustus'', respectively). In ''[[Hamlet]]'', after meeting with the travelling actors, Hamlet requests the Player perform a speech about the Trojan War, which at 2.2.429–32 has an echo of Marlowe's ''[[Dido, Queen of Carthage (play)|Dido, Queen of Carthage]]''. In ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'' Shakespeare brings on a character "Marcade" (three syllables) in conscious acknowledgement of Marlowe's character "Mercury", also attending the King of Navarre, in ''Massacre at Paris''. The significance, to those of Shakespeare's audience who were familiar with ''Hero and Leander'', was Marlowe's identification of himself with the god [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]].<ref name="Jean-Christophe Mayer2008">{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Richard|author-link=Richard Wilson (scholar)|editor=Mayer, Jean-Christophe |title=Representing France and the French in early modern English drama|year=2008|publisher=University of Delaware Press|location=Newark, DE|isbn=978-0-87413-000-3|pages=95–97|chapter=Worthies away: the scene begins to cloud in Shakespeare's Navarre}}</ref>

==Shakespeare authorship theory==
{{Main|Marlovian theory of Shakespeare authorship|Shakespeare authorship question}}
An [[argument]] has arisen about the notion that Marlowe may have faked his death and then continued to write under the assumed name of William Shakespeare. Academic consensus rejects alternative candidates for authorship of Shakespeare's plays and sonnets, including Marlowe.<ref>Kathman, David (2003), "The Question of Authorship", in Wells, Stanley; Orlin, Lena C., Shakespeare: an Oxford Guide, Oxford University Press, pp. 620–32, {{ISBN|978-0-19-924522-2}}</ref>

===Plays===
Six dramas have been attributed to the authorship of Christopher Marlowe either alone or in collaboration with other writers, with varying degrees of evidence. The writing sequence or chronology of these plays is mostly unknown and is offered here with any dates and evidence known. Among the little available information we have, ''Dido'' is believed to be the first Marlowe play performed, while it was ''Tamburlaine'' that was first to be performed on a regular commercial stage in London in 1587. Believed by many scholars to be Marlowe's greatest success, ''Tamburlaine'' was the first English play written in [[blank verse]] and, with [[Thomas Kyd]]'s ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]'', is generally considered the beginning of the mature phase of the [[Elizabethan theatre]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/nael/16century/topic_1/welcome.htm |title=See especially the middle section in which the author shows how another Cambridge graduate, Thomas Preston makes his title character express his love in a popular play written around 1560 and compares that "clumsy" line with ''Doctor Faustus'' addressing Helen of Troy |publisher=Wwnorton.com |access-date=10 December 2011}}</ref>

===Poetry and translations===
Publication and responses to the poetry and translations credited to Marlowe primarily occurred posthumously, including:
* ''[[Amores (Ovid)|Amores]]'', first book of Latin [[elegiac couplet]]s by Ovid with translation by Marlowe (''c''. 1580s); copies publicly burned as offensive in 1599.
* ''[[The Passionate Shepherd to His Love]]'', by Marlowe. (''c.'' 1587–1588);{{sfnp|Cheney|2004|p=xvi}} a popular lyric of the time.

===Collaborations===
Modern scholars still look for evidence of collaborations between Marlowe and other writers. In 2016, one publisher was the first to endorse the scholarly claim of a collaboration between Marlowe and the playwright William Shakespeare:
* ''[[Henry VI, Part 1|Henry VI]]'' by William Shakespeare is now credited as a collaboration with Marlowe in the [[The Oxford Shakespeare|New Oxford Shakespeare]] series, published in 2016. Marlowe appears as co-author of the three ''[[Henry VI, Part 1|Henry VI]]'' plays, though some scholars doubt any actual collaboration.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Shea|first1=Christopher D.|title=New Oxford Shakespeare Edition Credits Christopher Marlowe as a Co-author|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/25/books/shakespeare-christopher-marlowe-henry-vi.html|access-date=24 October 2016|work=The New York Times|date=24 October 2016}}</ref><ref name="cowrite">{{cite news|title=Christopher Marlowe credited as Shakespeare's co-writer|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-37750558|access-date=24 October 2016|publisher=BBC|date=24 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Freebury-Jones|first=Darren|date=|title=Augean Stables; Or, the State of Modern Authorship Attribution Studies|url=https://www.archivdigital.info/ce/augean-stables-or-the-state-of-modern-authorship-attribution-studies/detail.html|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2021-01-23|website=www.archivdigital.info}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Freebury-Jones|first=Darren|date=2017-07-03|title=Did Shakespeare Really Co-Write 2 Henry VI with Marlowe?|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/0895769X.2017.1295360|journal=ANQ: A Quarterly Journal of Short Articles, Notes and Reviews|volume=30|issue=3|pages=137–141|doi=10.1080/0895769X.2017.1295360|s2cid=164545629|issn=0895-769X}}</ref>

===Contemporary reception===
{{refimprove section|date=February 2021}}
Marlowe's plays were enormously successful, possibly because of the imposing stage presence of his lead actor, [[Edward Alleyn]]. Alleyn was unusually tall for the time and the haughty roles of Tamburlaine, Faustus and Barabas were probably written for him. Marlowe's plays were the foundation of the repertoire of Alleyn's company, the [[Admiral's Men]], throughout the 1590s. One of Marlowe's poetry translations did not fare as well. In 1599, Marlowe's translation of [[Ovid]] was banned and copies were publicly burned as part of [[John Whitgift|Archbishop Whitgift]]'s crackdown on offensive material.

The gods interfere with the love lives of Dido and Aeneas, with Venus using Cupid to trick Dido into falling in love with Aeneas, rather than Iarbas, her Carthaginian suitor. Dido and Aeneas pledge their love to each other, but the Trojans warn Aeneas that their future is in Italy, which is also where Mercury and the other gods order Aeneas to go.

The play begins with the ghost of a fictionalised [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]], who introduces Barabas, the Jew of Malta, in his counting house. The Governor of Malta has seized the wealth of all Jewish citizens to pay the Turks not to invade. As a consequence, Barabas designs and executes a homicidal tirade of events in retaliation against the governor and is assisted by his slave, Ithamore. Barabas' murderous streak includes: the governor's son dying in a duel; frightening his own daughter, who joins a nunnery for safety but is afterward poisoned by her father; the strangling of an old friar and the framing of another friar for the murder; and, the death of Ithamore, a prostitute and her friend, who had threatened to expose him. Finally, Barabas betrays Malta by planning another invasion by the Turks, but is outwitted when the Christians and Turks resolve the conflict and leave him to burn alive in a trap he has set for others, but has mistakenly fallen into himself.
:'''''Additional information (significance)''''': The performances of the play were a success and it remained popular for the next fifty years. This play helps to establish the strong theme of "anti-authoritarianism" that is found throughout Marlowe's works.

The earlier (A text) edition of 1604 simply had ''The Tragicall History of D. Faustus''.</ref> a very large 35-character cast, plus other additional scholars, cardinals, soldiers, and devils. Based on the German ''[[Faustbuch]]'', which itself can be traced to a fourth-century tale known as [[Deal with the Devil|"The Devil's Pact,"]] Marlowe's play opens with a Prologue, where the Chorus introduces [[Faust|Doctor Faustus]] and his story. Faustus is a brilliant scholar who leaves behind the study of logic, medicine, law and divinity to study magic and [[necromancy]], the art of speaking to the dead. When he is approached by a Good and Bad Angel, it is the Bad Angel who wins his attentions by promising that he will become a great magician. Faustus ignores his other scholarly duties and attempts to summon a devil. By revoking his own baptism he attracts the attention of [[Lucifer]], [[Mephistopheles]] and other devils. Faustus strikes a pact with Lucifer, allowing him 24 years with Mephistopheles as his assistant, but after the pact begins Mephistopheles will not answer Faustus' questions. The two angels return, but even though Faustus waffles, coercion from the devils has him again swear allegiance to Lucifer. Faustus achieves nothing worthwhile with his pact, warns other scholars of his folly, and the play ends with Faustus dragged off to [[Hell]] by Mephistopheles as the Chorus attempts a moral summation of events with an Epilogue.
:'''''Additional information (significance)''''': This is the first dramatised version of the [[Faust]] legend of a scholar's dealing with the devil. Marlowe deviates from earlier versions of [[Deal with the Devil|"The Devil's Pact"]] significantly: Marlowe's protagonist is unable to "burn his books" or repent to a merciful God to have his contract annulled at the end of the play; he is carried off by demons; and, in the 1616 [[quarto]], his mangled corpse is found by the scholar characters. 
:'''''Additional information (attribution)''''': The 'B text' was highly edited and censored, owing in part to the shifting theatre laws regarding religious words onstage during the seventeenth-century. Because it contains several additional scenes believed to be the additions of other playwrights, particularly [[Samuel Rowley]] and William Bird (''alias'' Borne), a recent edition attributes the authorship of both versions to "Christopher Marlowe and his collaborator and revisers." This recent edition has tried to establish that the 'A text' was assembled from Marlowe's work and another writer, with the 'B text' as a later revision.{{sfnp|Healy|2004|p=179}}<ref>"The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus" (‘A’ Text) and ('B' Text) in David Bevington and Eric Rasmussen (eds.), Christopher Marlowe, ''Doctor Faustus and Other Plays, World’s Classics'' (Oxford University Press, 1995).</ref>
:'''''Evidence''''': No manuscripts by Marlowe exist for this play.{{sfnp|Maguire|2004|p=44}} The two earliest-printed [[extant literature|extant versions]] of the play, A and B, form a textual problem for scholars. Both were published after Marlowe's death and scholars disagree which text is more representative of Marlowe's original. Some editions are based on a combination of the two texts. Late-twentieth-century scholarly consensus identifies 'A text' as more representative because it contains irregular character names and [[idiosyncratic]] spelling, which are believed to reflect the author's handwritten manuscript or "[[foul papers]]". In comparison, 'B text' is highly edited with several additional scenes possibly written by other playwrights.{{sfnp|Healy|2004|pp=xix, 179}}

The prelude to '''the Massacre''' begins with a wedding between the sister of France's Catholic king, Charles IX, to the Protestant King of Navarre, which places a Protestant in line for the crown of France. Navarre knows Guise "seeks to murder all the Protestants" in Paris for the wedding, but he trusts the protections promised by Charles IX and the Queen Mother, Catharine (de Medici). The Queen Mother, however, is secretly funding the homicidal plots of Guise, shown to us in murder vignettes executed by Guise henchman. In a soliloquy, Guise tells how all Catholics—even priests—will help murder Protestants. After the first deaths, Charles IX is persuaded to support Guise out of fear of Protestant retaliation. Catholic killers at the Massacre will wear visored helmets marked with a white cross and murder Protestants until the bells cease ringing. Charles IX feels great guilt for the Massacre. As the bells toll, Protestants are chased by soldiers, murder vignettes reveal cruelties and offstage massacres are retold by their killers. • The '''death of Guise''' is a series of intrigues. Queen Mother Catherine vows to kill and replace her unreliable son Charles IX, with her son Henry. When Charles IX dies of a broken heart (historically, of tuberculosis), a series of events unfold: Henry III is crowned king of France, but his Queen Mother will replace him as well if he dares to stop the killing of "Puritans"; Henry III makes Duke Joyeux the General of his army against Navarre, whose army is outside Paris and will later slay Joyeux; meanwhile, Guise becomes an unhinged, jealous husband who brings his army and popularity to Paris, whereupon the King has him assassinated for treason; with Guise gone, Navarre pledges his support to Henry III; the Queen Mother mourns the loss of Guise as his brother, the Cardinal, is assassinated; and finally, Henry III is stabbed with a poisoned knife by a friar sent by Guise's other brother, the Duke of Dumaine. The final scene is of the death of Henry III and the rise of Navarre as the first Protestant King of France.
:'''''Additional information (significance)''''': ''The Massacre at Paris'' is considered Marlowe's most dangerous play, as agitators in London seized on its theme to advocate the murders of refugees from the [[Spanish Netherlands|low countries]] of the [[Spanish Netherlands]], and it warns [[Elizabeth I]] of this possibility in its last scene.<ref>{{cite book |last=Nicholl |first=Charles |title=The Reckoning: The Murder of Christopher Marlowe |url=https://archive.org/details/reckoningmurdero0000nich |url-access=registration |publisher=Jonathan Cape |location=London |year=1992 |page=[https://archive.org/details/reckoningmurdero0000nich/page/41 41] |chapter=Libels and Heresies |isbn=978-0-224-03100-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Hoenselaars|first=A.

It could also provide an approximate date of composition for the play. When compared with the extant printed text and his other work, other scholars reject the attribution to Marlowe.

Current scholarship notes that there are only 1147 lines in the play, half the amount of a typical play of the 1590s.
