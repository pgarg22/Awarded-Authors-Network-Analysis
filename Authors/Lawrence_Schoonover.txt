==Bibliography==
* ''The Burnished Blade'' (1948). The flaming martyrdom of Joan of Arc opens this historical romance in France at the dawn of the Renaissance. Among the onlookers at that terrible spectacle was Pierre, a frightened boy whom Hugh, the armorer, had rescued that morning on the road outside Rouen. Under Hugh's tutelage, Pierre learns the closely guarded secrets of the armorer's trade. But he is destined not to use them...
* ''Gentle Infidel'' (1950, 2009). Two lovely women, different as night and day, two conflicting faiths - one of the East, the other of the West - claimed the heart of young Michael da Montelupo.  The son of Christian parents, handsome, stalwart Michael was impressed as a boy into the Turkish Emperor's elite [[Janissary]] corps, rigorously trained to become a brave, fanatical Moslem soldier. As a Turk, Michael fell under the sultry spell of Aeshia, a sensuous, scheming young Turkish wife, who tricked him into a relationship that nearly cost him his career - and his life.  But Angelica, the slim, fair, Venetian girl, awakened in him echoes of his early Christian faith.  It was for her that he put the East and its barbaric turbulence behind.  Michael's romantic adventures are enacted against the background of an era of gaudy decadence, crafty intrigue, and exotic, colorful pageantry.  The climax is reached in the spectacular siege and [[Fall of Constantinople|conquest of Constantinople in 1453]], which marked Christendom's last stand against the infidel.
