'''Jovan Dučić''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Јован Дучић}}, {{IPA-sh|jǒʋan dûtʃitɕ|pron}}; 17 February 1871 – 7 April 1943) was a [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Herzegovinian Serb]] [[poet-diplomat]] and academic.

He is one of the most influential Serbian lyricists and [[Modernist poetry|modernist]] poets. Dučić published his first collection of poetry in [[Mostar]] in 1901 and his second in [[Belgrade]] in 1908. He also wrote often in [[prose]], writing a number of literary essays, studies on writers, letters by poets from Switzerland, Greece and Spain and the book ''Blago cara Radovana'' for which he is most remembered when it comes to his writing.

Dučić was also one of the founders of the ''[[Narodna Odbrana]]'', a nationalist [[non-governmental organization]] in the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] and he was a member of the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts|Serbian Royal Academy]].

==Biography==
===Early life and diplomacy===
Jovan Dučić was born on 17 February 1871 in [[Trebinje]], at the time part of [[Bosnia Vilayet]] within the [[Ottoman Empire]].

In Trebinje he attended primary school. He moved on to a high school in [[Mostar]] and trained to become a teacher in [[Sombor]]. He worked as a teacher in several towns before returning to Mostar, where he founded (with writer [[Svetozar Ćorović]] and poet [[Aleksa Šantić]]) a literary magazine called ''[[Zora (magazine)|Zora]]'' (Dawn).<ref name="Jugoslovenski književni leksikon">{{cite book |author= Boško Novaković |editor = Živan Milisavac |date=1971 |title=Jugoslovenski književni leksikon |trans-title=Yugoslav Literary Lexicon |publisher=[[Matica srpska]] |language=sh |location= [[Novi Sad]] ([[Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina|SAP Vojvodina]], [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|SR Serbia]]) |pages=109–110 }}</ref>

Dučić's openly expressed Serbian patriotism caused difficulties with the authorities – at that time [[Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia and Herzegovina was ''de facto'' incorporated]] into the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] – and he moved abroad to pursue higher studies, mostly in [[Geneva]] and Paris. He was awarded a law degree by the [[University of Geneva]] and, following his return from abroad, entered Serbian diplomatic service in 1907.<ref name="Jugoslovenski književni leksikon"/> Although he had previously expressed opposition to the idea of creating a [[Yugoslavia]], he became the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|new country's]] first ambassador to [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] (in 1937). He had a distinguished diplomatic career in this capacity, serving in [[Istanbul]], [[Sofia]], Rome, [[Athens]], [[Cairo]], Madrid and [[Lisbon]].<ref name="Jugoslovenski književni leksikon"/> Dučić spoke several foreign languages and wrote travelogues based on some of his diplomatic posts which were published in his work ''Cities and Chimeras'', such as his time in Egypt where he served as the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]'s first [[chargé d'affaires]] in that country.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Todorović |first1=Miloš |title=Serbian–Egyptian Intercultural Relations |date=2021 |publisher=Alia Mundi |location=Belgrade |isbn=978-86-81396-12-4 |page=143-148 |url=https://www.academia.edu/49589125/Srpsko_egipatski_me%C4%91ukulturni_odnosi_Serbian_Egyptian_Intercultural_Relations |access-date=8 July 2021}}</ref>

===Poetry===

It was as a poet that Dučić gained his greatest distinctions. He published his first book of poetry in Mostar in 1901 and his second in [[Belgrade]], 1908. He wrote prose as well: several essays and studies about writers, ''Blago cara Radovana'' (''Tsar Radovan's treasure'') and poetry letters from Switzerland, Greece, Spain and other countries.

Like Šantić, Dučić's work was initially heavily influenced by that of [[Vojislav Ilić]], the leading Serbian poet of the late 19th century. His travels abroad helped him to develop his own individual style, in which the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] movement was perhaps the greatest single influence. In his poetry he explored quite new territory that was previously unknown in Serbian poetry. He restricted himself to only two verse styles, the symmetrical dodecasyllable (the Alexandrine) and hendecasyllable—both French in origin—in order to focus on the symbolic meaning of his work. He expressed a double fear, of vulgarity of thought, and vulgarity of expression.

===Personal life===
In the autumn of 1893, during the party in the newly built hotel Drina in [[Bijeljina]], a young and ambitious teacher Dučić met recent School of Commerce  graduate Magdalena Živanović. They got engaged with on 5 November 1893, and their correspondence continued even Dučić's departure from Bijeljina to [[Mostar]] to teach from 1895 to 1899.

A part of the correspondence is kept safe up to this day, as well as the letter which Dučić's friend and poet [[Aleksa Šantić]] redirected to Magdalena on 6 April 1901. year asking for help in collecting a subscription for his songs. Ljiljana Lukić, a retired professor, keeps a personal copy of the correspondence between Dučić and Magdalena.

Professor Ljiljana Lukić states that Dučić lived for a short time in the house of Magdalena Nikolić who lived with her sister. After break up with Dučić, Magdalena shouted that she would never leave home again. "Like a novel heroine, she lived by her memories and the only happy moments she had was in reading the letters and songs of the man she loved", as Professor Lukić concludes. Dučić's secret fiancé left in the amanet the following words to be written after her death on the monument, which are still read today on the Bijeljina graveyard: Maga Nikolić-Živanović, 1874–1957, the poet herself and first inspiration of poet Jovan Dučić.

Twenty years before Magdalena's death, while Dučić was the authorized minister of [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], a request was received that testifies of the deep trace which Dučić left in [[Bijeljina]]. Singing society Srbadija asked the minister to help in building a home for the needs of society.

The Embassy of Serbia in Hungary is in the house which Jovan Dučić received from a Hungarian woman, and then donated it to the state.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.politika.rs/scc/clanak/353771/Sve-Duciceve-ljubavi|title=Све Дучићеве љубави|first=Небојша|last=Кундачина|website=Politika Online}}</ref>

===Exile, death and legacy===

Dučić went into exile in the United States in 1941 following the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invasion]] and [[World War II in Yugoslavia|occupation]] of Yugoslavia, where he joined his relative Mihajlo (Michael) in [[Gary, Indiana]]. From then until his death two years later, he led a Chicago-based organization, the [[Serbian National Defense Council]] (founded by [[Mihailo Pupin]] in 1914) which represented the Serbian diaspora in the US. During these two years, he wrote many poems, historical books and newspaper articles espousing Serbian nationalist causes and protesting the [[Jasenovac concentration camp|mass murder of Serbs]] by the pro-[[Nazism|Nazi]] [[Ustaše]] regime of Croatia. In Yugoslav school anthologies immediately after
WWII he had been declared persona non grata and  widely viewed as a Serbian [[Chauvinism|chauvinist]]<ref>Lenard J. Cohen, Jasna Dragovic-Soso; (2007) ''State Collapse in South-Eastern Europe: New Perspectives on Yugoslavia's Disintegration'' p. 211; Purdue University Press, {{ISBN|1557534608}}</ref>

He died on 7 April 1943. His funeral took place at the [[Saint Sava Serbian Orthodox Church (Merrillville, Indiana)|Saint Sava Serbian Orthodox Church in Gary, Indiana]] and he was buried in the [[Saint Sava Serbian Orthodox Monastery and Seminary|Saint Sava Serbian Orthodox Monastery]] cemetery in [[Libertyville, Illinois]]. He expressed a wish in his will to be buried in his home town of Trebinje, a goal which was finally realized when he was reburied there on 22 October 2000 in the newly built [[Hercegovačka Gračanica]] monastery.

His ''Acta Diplomatica'' (Diplomatic Letters) was published posthumously in the United States (in 1952) and in the former-Yugoslavia (in 1991).

The Jovan Dučić Award is awarded for achievements in poetry and it is awarded every year during the manifestation "Dučić's Night" in [[Trebinje]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.glassrpske.com/lat/plus/teme/jovan-ducic-udario-pecat-srpskoj-poeziji/53431|title=Jovan Dučić udario pečat srpskoj poeziji|first=Svetlana|last=Tadić|date=21 February 2011|website=Glas Srpske}}</ref>
