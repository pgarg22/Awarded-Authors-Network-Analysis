'''Patrick Süskind''' ({{IPA-de|ˈpa.tʁɪk ˈzyːsˌkɪnt|lang|De-Patrick Süskind.ogg}}; born 26 March 1949) is a German writer and screenwriter, known best for his novel ''[[Perfume (novel)|Perfume: The Story of a Murderer]]'', first published in 1985.

==Early life==
Süskind was born in Ambach, [[Bavaria]]. His father was writer and journalist [[Wilhelm Emanuel Süskind]], who worked for the newspaper ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' and is famous as the co-author of the well-known publication ''Aus dem Wörterbuch des Unmenschen'' (''From the Dictionary of an Inhuman''),<ref>''Aus dem Wörterbuch des Unmenschen'' by Dolf Sternberger, Gerhard Storz & Wilhelm E. Süskind, Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag, Munich, 1962</ref> a critical collection of essays concerning the language of the Nazi era. Patrick Süskind went to school in Holzhausen, a small Bavarian village. His mother worked as a sports trainer; his older brother Martin E. Süskind is also a journalist. Süskind has many relatives from the aristocracy in Württemberg, making him one of the descendants of the exegete [[Johann Albrecht Bengel]] and of the reformer [[Johannes Brenz]].

After his [[Abitur|qualification testing]] for university and his mandatory [[Zivildienst|community service]], he studied medieval and modern history at the [[University of Munich]] and in [[Aix-en-Provence]] from 1968–1974, but never graduated.<ref>[http://www.focus.de/kultur/buecher/patrick-sueskind-so-fluechtig-wie-ein-duft_aid_383496.html Focus: Patrick Süskind - So flüchtig wie ein Duft]</ref> Funded by his parents, he relocated to Paris, where he wrote "mainly short, unpublished fiction and longer screenplays which were not made into films".<ref>Francke, Eckhart. "Patrick Süskind". ''Kritisches Lexikon zur deutschsprachigen Gegenwartsliteratur'', 42. NLG, 1-8</ref>

==Work==
During 1981, he had his first major success with the play ''[[Der Kontrabaß]]'' (''The Double Bass''), which was conceived originally as a radio play. During the theatrical season of 1984–85, the play was performed more than 500 times. The only role is that of a tragi-comical orchestral musician.  During the 1980s, Süskind was also successful as a screenwriter for the television productions ''[[Monaco Franze – Der ewige Stenz|Monaco Franze]]'' (1983) and ''[[Kir Royal – Aus dem Leben eines Klatschreporters|Kir Royal]]'' (1987), among others. For his screenplay of ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Rossini – oder die mörderische Frage, wer mit wem schlief|de|3=Rossini – oder die mörderische Frage, wer mit wem schlief|lt=Rossini}}'', directed by [[Helmut Dietl]], he won the Screenplay Prize of the German Department for Culture during 1996. He rejected other awards, like the [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|FAZ]]-Literaturpreis, the [[Toucan Prize]], and the Gutenbergpreis.

His best-known work is the internationally acclaimed bestseller ''[[Perfume (novel)|Perfume: The Story of a Murderer]]'' (1985). This was made into a movie in 2006 by [[Tom Tykwer]]. ''Perfume'' was on the bestselling list of the German weekly news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' for nine years. He is also the author of a novella, ''[[The Pigeon (novella)|The Pigeon]]'' (1988), ''[[The Story of Mr Sommer|The Story of Mr. Sommer]]'' (1991), ''Three Stories and a Reflection'' (1996), and a collection of essays, ''[[On Love and Death]]'' (2006). French cartoonist [[Jean-Jacques Sempé|Sempe]] illustrated the images in ''The Story of Mr. Sommer'' (1991).

== Personal life ==
Süskind lives as a recluse in Munich, in Seeheim (on Lake Starnberg), and in France at [[Montolieu]]. The public knows little about him; he has withdrawn from literary society and does not grant interviews or allow himself to be photographed.
