'''Craig Anthony Raine''', [[FRSL]] (born 3 December 1944) is an English contemporary poet. Along with [[Christopher Reid]], he is a notable pioneer of [[Martian poetry]], a movement that expresses alienation with the world, society and objects.<ref>[http://www.contemporarywriters.com/authors/?p=auth212 British Council: Biography]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216074837/http://www.contemporarywriters.com/authors/?p=auth212 |date=16 December 2010 }} – "It is worth recalling how ''The Onion, Memory'' (1978) and ''A Martian Sends a Postcard Home'' (1979), Raine’s first two poetry collections, made such a spectacular impact on the then becalmed world of British poetry, seeming to set off a stylistic revolution of visual similes, wordplay and punning – even if in the long run it turned out to be a fashion. 'The Martian School', so-called by his friend [[James Fenton]] and inaugurated with another, [[Christopher Reid]], had a widespread effect on readers and young poets alike, spawning a host of imitators."</ref> He was a fellow of [[New College, Oxford]] from 1991 to 2010 and is now [[emeritus]] professor. He has been the editor of ''[[Areté]]'' since 1999.

==Early life==
Raine was born in Bishop Auckland, County Durham, the son of Norman Edward and Olive Marie Raine.<ref name=autogenerated1>‘RAINE, Craig Anthony’, Who's Who 2012, A & C Black, 2012; online edn, Oxford University Press, Dec 2011 ; online edn, Nov 2011 [http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whoswho/U31792, accessed 20 April 2012]</ref> His father was the North of England amateur [[boxing]] champion in 1937.<ref name="journal">{{cite news |title=Ex-boxer fined £100 on liquor charges |work=Newcastle Journal |date=6 January 1945}}</ref> He then worked as a bomb armourer for the [[RAF]], until forced to retire due to [[epilepsy]] caused by a skull fracture.<ref name=autogenerated3>FATE PLAYS AN ELECTRIFYING HAND, The Northern Echo, 28 October 2002</ref><ref name="journal">{{cite news |title=Ex-boxer fined £100 on liquor charges |work=Newcastle Journal |date=6 January 1945}}</ref> After the RAF his father worked as a pub landlord.<ref name="journal">{{cite news |title=Ex-boxer fined £100 on liquor charges |work=Newcastle Journal |date=6 January 1945}}</ref> He was raised in a [[prefabricated building|prefab]] in [[Shildon]], a town near Bishop Auckland.<ref>[http://living.scotsman.com/books/Interview-Craig-Raine-author.6399577.jp Interview: Craig Raine, author - News - Scotsman.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=autogenerated2>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/oct/17/craig-raine-interview-wroe A life in writing | Books | The Guardian<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He won a scholarship to [[Barnard Castle School]], where he lived as a boarder.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Of his time there he has recalled that it seemed that everyone else's parents seemed to be: <blockquote>accountants or surgeons or something. I couldn't say my father was an ex-boxer who did faith healing, had epileptic fits and lived off a pension. So for a while I said he was a football manager. But by the end I was inviting my friends home and they thought he was just as terrific as I did.<ref name=autogenerated2 /></blockquote>

Raine has commented on his education: "At Barnard Castle I was taught by an absolutely remarkable English teacher, Arnold Snodgrass, a friend of [[W. H. Auden]] at Oxford [and later [[Robert Graves]]]. There was no question that he altered my mindset on things and made me very critical."<ref name=autogenerated3 /><ref>http://robertgraves.org/trust/print.php?id=7313</ref> At school he wrote "'pimply [[Dylan Thomas]]' poems, some of which he sent to [[Philip Toynbee]], then lead reviewer at ''[[The Observer]]''".<ref name=autogenerated2 />

Raine received his university education at [[Exeter College, Oxford|Exeter College]], [[University of Oxford]], where he received a BA in English and later received his [[B.Phil]].<ref name=autogenerated2 /><ref name=BC>[http://www.contemporarywriters.com/authors/?p=auth212 British Council: Biography]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216074837/http://www.contemporarywriters.com/authors/?p=auth212 |date=16 December 2010 }}</ref>
