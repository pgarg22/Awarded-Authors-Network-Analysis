==Influences==
Ali was deeply moved by the music of [[Begum Akhtar]]. The two had met through a friend of Akhtar's when Ali was a teenager and her music became a lasting presence in his life. Features of her ghazal rendition—such as wit, wordplay and ''nakhra'' (affectation)—were present in Ali's poetry as well. However, [[Amitav Ghosh]] suspects that the strongest connection between the two rose from the idea that "sorrow has no finer mask than a studied lightness of manner"—traces of which were seen in Ali's and Akhtar's demeanor in their respective lives.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ghosh|first1=Amitav|title=The Ghat of The Only World|url=http://www.amitavghosh.com/aghashahidali.html|website=Amitav Ghosh}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://scroll.in/article/923025/how-the-legendary-begum-akhtar-influenced-the-life-and-poetry-of-agha-shahid-ali |title = How the legendary Begum Akhtar influenced the life and poetry of Agha Shahid Ali}}</ref>
