Momoko was exposed to haiku at an early age through her mother, who was a member of a local haiku group. Upon her mother's encouragement, she sought out [[Yamaguchi Seison]] (1892–1988) and asked to join his haiku group when she was in university.{{sfn|Ueda|2003|p=193}}{{sfn|Friedman|2014|pp=iii&ndash;vii}} After graduating university, she stopped composing haiku for a period of nearly ten years, then returned to the art and to Seison's haiku group in 1968. That same year, she began what became her trademark haiku pilgrimages, the first of which was to Japan's famous [[cherry blossom]]s and spanned 28 years.{{sfn|Ueda|2003|pp=193&ndash;194}} In 2012, she completed a 30-year endeavor leading haiku pilgrimages to Japan's four main pilgrimage routes: The Shikoku, Saigoku, Bandõ, and Chichibu circuits. In 1990, after the death of her mentor Seison, she created a nationwide haiku organization, AOI (藍生), which she leads,{{sfn|Friedman|2014|pp=iii&ndash;vii}} and ''Aoi'', a haiku magazine.{{sfn|Ueda|2003|p=193}}{{sfn|Friedman|2006|p=48}}

Kuroda's first haiku collection, ''ki no isu'' (The Wooden Chair) published in 1981, received the Best Modern Woman Haiku Poet award and the Haiku Poets Association Best New Talent award. Her fifth haiku collection, ''Nikkõ Gekkõ'' (Sunlight, Moonlight) earned her the prestigious 2011 Dakotsu prize. She is a haiku selector for the ''[[Nihon Keizai Shimbun]]''.{{sfn|Friedman|2014|pp=iii&ndash;vii}}
