'''Maxine Kumin''' (June 6, 1925 – February 6, 2014) was an American poet and author. She was appointed [[Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress]] in 1981–1982.<ref>{{cite web | title=Poet Laureate Timeline: 1971–1980 | url=https://www.loc.gov/poetry/laureate-1981-1990.html | publisher=Library of Congress | year=2008 | access-date=2008-12-19}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Early years===
Maxine Kumin was born '''Maxine Winokur''' on June 6, 1925 in [[Philadelphia]], the daughter of Jewish parents, and attended a Catholic kindergarten and primary school. She received her B.A. in 1946 and her M.A. in 1948 from [[Radcliffe College]]. In June 1946 she married Victor Kumin, an engineering consultant; they had three children, two daughters and a son. In 1957, she studied poetry with John Holmes at the [[Boston Center for Adult Education]]. There she met [[Anne Sexton]], with whom she started a friendship that continued until Sexton's suicide in 1974. Kumin taught English from 1958 to 1961 and 1965 to 1968 at [[Tufts University]]; from 1961 to 1963 she was a scholar at the Radcliffe Institute for Independent Study. She also held appointments as a visiting lecturer and poet in residence at many American colleges and universities. From 1976 until her death in February 2014, she and her husband lived on a farm in [[Warner, New Hampshire|Warner]], [[New Hampshire]], where they bred Arabian and quarter horses.<ref>[http://mobile.concordmonitor.com/home/8050665-108/being-maxine-kumin In her own words: Being Maxine Kumin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125052625/http://mobile.concordmonitor.com/home/8050665-108/being-maxine-kumin |date=2015-11-25 }}</ref>

===Career===
Kumin's many awards include the Eunice Tietjens Memorial Prize for Poetry (1972), the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]] (1973) for ''Up Country'', in 1995 the [[Aiken Taylor Award for Modern American Poetry]], the 1994 [[Poets' Prize]] (for ''Looking for Luck''), an [[American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters]] Award for excellence in literature (1980), an Academy of American Poets fellowship (1986), the 1999 [[Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize]], and six honorary degrees. In 1979, the [[Supersisters]] trading card set was produced and distributed; one of the cards featured Kumin's name and picture.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wulf |first=Steve |url=http://espn.go.com/espnw/news-commentary/article/12535055/original-roster |title=Supersisters: Original Roster |publisher=Espn.go.com |date=2015-03-23 |access-date=2015-06-04}}</ref> She was also awarded the [[Sarah Joseph Hale Award]] and [[the Levinson Prize]]. She has also received a [[National Endowment for the Arts]] grant and fellowships from the [[Academy of American Poets]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/maxine-kumin|title=About Maxine Kumin &#124; Academy of American Poets}}</ref> In 1981–1982, she served as the poetry consultant to the Library of Congress.  Kumin has been published in [[Beloit Poetry Journal]].

Critics have compared Kumin with [[Elizabeth Bishop]] because of her meticulous observations and with [[Robert Frost]], for she frequently devotes her attention to the rhythms of life in rural [[New England]]. She has been grouped with [[confessional poets]] such as [[Anne Sexton]], [[Sylvia Plath]] and [[Robert Lowell]]. But unlike the confessionalists, Kumin eschews high rhetoric and adopts a plain style. Throughout her career, Kumin has struck a balance between her sense of life's transience and her fascination with the dense physical presence of the world around her. She served as the 1985 judge of the [[Brittingham Prize in Poetry]] and she selected [[Patricia Dobler]]'s ''Talking To Strangers''.

She taught poetry in New England College's Low-Residency MFA Program. She was also a contributing editor at ''[[The Alaska Quarterly Review]]''. Together with fellow-poet [[Carolyn Kizer]], she first served on and then resigned from the board of chancellors of the [[Academy of American Poets]], an act that galvanized the movement for opening this august body to broader representation by women and minorities.<ref>[http://www.maxinekumin.com/ Maxin Kumin's Biography]</ref>

Kumin, aged 88, died in February 2014 at her home in Warner, following a year of failing health.<ref name=obit>[https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/pulitzer-winning-nh-poet-maxine-kumin-dies-88-22408728 "Poet Maxine Kumin Dies at 88"], February 7, 2014, ABC News</ref>

Kumin is believed to be the last person to have seen [[Anne Sexton]] alive, as the two of them had had lunch the day of Sexton's suicide in 1974.
