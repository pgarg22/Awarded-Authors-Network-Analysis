'''Ferdinand Raimund''' (born Ferdinand Jakob Raimann; 1 June 1790 – 5 September 1836, [[Pottenstein, Austria|Pottenstein]], [[Lower Austria]]) was an Austrian [[actor]] and [[Playwright|dramatist]].

== Life and work ==
He was born in Vienna as a son of [[Bohemia]]n [[woodturning]] [[master craftsman]] Jakob Raimann. In 1811, he acted at the [[Theater in der Josefstadt]], and, in 1817 at the [[Theater in der Leopoldstadt|Leopoldstädter Theater]]. In 1823 he produced his first play, ''Der Barometermacher auf der Zauberinsel'', which was followed by ''Der Diamant des Geisterkönigs'' (1824). The still popular ''Bauer als Millionär'' (1826), ''Der Alpenkönig und der Menschenfeind'' (1828) and ''Der Verschwender'' (1834), incidental music by [[Conradin Kreutzer]], are Raimund's masterpieces. Raimund's comedies are still frequently performed in Germany and Austria.

When Raimund was bitten by a dog, which he falsely believed to be [[Rabies|rabid]], he shot himself on 29 August 1836 and died on 5 September 1836 in Pottenstein, aged 46. Raimund is buried in [[Gutenstein, Austria|Gutenstein]], which features a Raimund memorial.

Raimund was a master of the Viennese [[Posse mit Gesang|Posse]] or [[farce]]; his rich humour is seen to best advantage in his realistic portraits of his fellow citizens. The [[Raimund Theater]] in Vienna is named after him.
