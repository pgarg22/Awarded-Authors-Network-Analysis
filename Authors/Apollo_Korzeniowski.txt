'''Apollo Korzeniowski''' (21 February 1820 – 23 May 1869) was a [[Poland|Polish]] poet, playwright, translator, clandestine political activist, and father of Polish-English novelist [[Joseph Conrad]].

==Life==
[[File:Apollo Korzeniowski.PNG|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Apollo Korzeniowski]]
Apollo Korzeniowski was born on 21 February 1820 in the [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russian]] village of Honoratka, then in [[Lypovets]] Uyezd, [[Kiev Governorate]], now [[Vinnytsia Oblast]], [[Ukraine]].  He was the son of Teodor Korzeniowski, an 1831 Polish Army captain, an impoverished [[szlachcic|nobleman]] who made a living running [[leasehold]]s, and Julia ''[[née]]'' Dyakiewicz.

After graduating from [[secondary school]] in [[Zhytomyr]], Apollo studied law and Oriental studies at the [[University of St. Petersburg]], then returned to Ukraine, where in 1852 he became an estate manager in the [[Podolia|Podole]] village of Łuczyniec.

In 1854, during the [[Crimean War]], Apollo took an active part in preparations to organize in [[Ukraine]]—in the rears of the Russian armies fighting in [[Crimea]]—a Polish uprising. It came to nought due to British and French reluctance to get involved in the Polish cause.<ref name="Taborski 167">{{Citation | last=Taborski | first=Roman | chapter=Korzeniowski, Apollo | title=[[Polski słownik biograficzny]] | page=167 }}</ref>

In April 1856, Apollo married Ewa Bobrowska, sister of Tadeusz Bobrowski<ref>Later the guardian and mentor of [[Joseph Conrad]].</ref> and Stefan Bobrowski.<ref>Who would be a leading "Red" activist during the [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprising]].</ref>  Together with his mother-in-law, Apollo leased the village of Derebczynka.  On 3 December 1857 the Korzeniowskis welcomed into the world their only child, Józef Teodor Konrad Korzeniowski—who would be referred to by Polish family and friends as ''Konrad''—the future English-language novelist, [[Joseph Conrad]].

In early 1859, after losing all their fortune on the leasehold, the Korzeniowskis moved permanently to [[Zhytomyr]], where Apollo for a time served as secretary of a bookselling and publishing association and became a member of the board of directors of a Polish theatre.

It was Apollo Korzeniowski's years at Łuczyniec, Derebczynka, and Zhytomyr that saw the greatest flowering of his literary creativity.  His first substantial work was a manuscript cycle of religious-patriotic poems, ''Purgatorial Songs'' (''Czyśćcowe pieśni'', 1849–54), which came into being under the clear—and none too fortunate<ref name="Taborski 167" />—influence of [[Zygmunt Krasiński]]'s poetry.  Apollo overcame this influence only in the final poem of the cycle, "Forethunder" ("''Przedgrom''"), into which his earlier preparations for the unrealized uprising introduced [[revolution]]ary accents.  These accents also appeared in a manuscript cycle of poems written in 1855 at the news of the Tsarist Army's bloody suppression of a peasant revolt in [[Skvira|Skvira County]].<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Citation | last=Taborski | first=Roman | chapter=Korzeniowski, Apollo | title=Polski słownik biograficzny | page=167 }}</ref>

In 1854 Korzeniowski wrote his ''[[chef d'oeuvre]]'', the drama ''Komedia'' (''Comedy''), its beginning parts modeled after [[Aleksandr Griboyedov]]'s comedy, ''Gorie ot uma'' (''[[Woe from Wit]]'').<ref>Taborski, Roman, "Korzeniowski, Apollo," ''Polski słownik biograficzny'', p. 167.</ref>  In ''Comedy'', Korzeniowski severely criticized the Polish nobility in Ukraine and opposed it to two positive heroes—Henryk,<ref>In English, "Henry."</ref> a revolutionary-conspirator, and the Secretary, a cowed [[plebeian]] who, as the action develops, rebels against his employer.  The play's 1855 publication (together with a lyric cycle, ''Stray [[Strophe]]s''—''Strofy oderwane'') became a social scandal.  ''Comedy'', severely treated by the critics, could gain a stage production.<ref name="ReferenceA" />

In 1858 Korzeniowski published a second drama, ''For a Pretty Penny'' (''Dla miłego grosza''), which was to some extent a continuation of ''Comedy''.  The new play likewise contained criticism of the wealthy Polish nobility in Ukraine, which was passing over to new, [[capitalism|capitalist]] methods of management; this time, however, the criticized [[Social environment|milieu]] was contrasted only with an old nobleman-conservative who desperately clung to the feudal system.

Apart from original work, Korzeniowski did [[translation]]s, including [[Alfred de Vigny]]'s 1835 drama ''Chatterton'' and several works by [[Victor Hugo]]: the dramas ''[[Hernani (drama)|Hernani]]'' and ''[[Marion Delorme (Hugo)|Marion Delorme]]'', and fragments of the poem collection, ''La Légende des siècles'' (The Legend of the Ages).  He also wrote much correspondence to the [[Warsaw]] newspapers.

At the turn of the 1850s and 1860s, Korzeniowski once again engaged in sociopolitical activity.  Thus, in April 1861 he took part, at Zhytomyr, in deliberations by delegates of the nobility from the three ''[[guberniya]]s'' comprising Rus Province—deliberations whose aim was the creation, with the help of the ''guberniya'' Agricultural Associations, of a common Polish organization for the Rus and Lithuanian provinces; Korzeniowski proposed then sending the [[Tsar]] a demand that these two provinces be joined administratively to [[Congress Poland]].<ref name="Taborski 168">{{Citation | last=Taborski | first=Roman | chapter=Korzeniowski, Apollo | title=Polski słownik biograficzny | page=168 }}</ref>

In May 1861, hearing of a patriotic movement developing in [[Warsaw]], Korzeniowski traveled from Zhytomyr to Warsaw.  There he sought the right to publish a radical socio-literary ''Biweekly'' (''Dwutygodnik'').  Initially he associated himself with K. Majewski, who would later name him in testimony as his deputy in a "[[triumvirate]]."  Korzeniowski, however, distanced himself from Majewski due to the latter's contacts with the "Whites" and became close to more radical groups, especially to youth in the [[Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw|Warsaw Academy of Fine Arts]] (''Akademia Sztuk Pięknych'') and to the "Red" representative, [[:pl:Ignacy Chmieleński|Ignacy Chmieleński]],<ref name="Taborski 168" />  who would become the chief of the National Government (''Rząd Narodowy'') during the [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprising]].

Korzeniowski became a leading organizer of political demonstrations.  He helped organize celebrations of the anniversary of the [[Union of Lublin]], was an organizer of a demonstration connected with the funeral of [[Archbishop]] A. Fijałkowski, and was the chief initiator of celebrations of the anniversary of the [[Union of Horodło]].  He also worked to organize a [[boycott]] of municipal elections that were scheduled to begin in Warsaw on 23 September 1861.
When this effort failed and [[martial law]] was declared in [[Congress Poland]], Korzeniowski was one of the chief initiators in forming (17 October 1861) a Municipal Committee (''Komitet Miejski'')—the supreme authority of the "Red" conspiracy.<ref name="Taborski 168" />

On the night of 20–21 October 1861, Korzeniowski was arrested and held in custody in the Tenth Pavilion of the [[Warsaw Citadel]].  In May 1862 he was sentenced by a [[court martial]] to exile in [[Vologda]]; a year later, this was commuted to [[Chernihiv]].<ref name="Taborski 168" />

In exile, Korzeniowski resumed his literary work.  He produced a memoir on "Poland and Muscovy" ("''Polska i Moskwa''," published in a periodical in 1864); a fragment of a play, ''No Rescue'' (''Bez ratunku''); and a "Study of Drama in the Works of Shakespeare" ("''Studia nad dramatycznością w utworach Szekspira''").  He also translated [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[Hard Times (novel)|Hard Times]]'' and [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Comedy of Errors|Comedy of Errors]]''.<ref name="Taborski 168" />

At Chernihiv, in 1865, Korzeniowski's wife Ewa died of [[tuberculosis]].  In late 1867, Korzeniowski himself, on account of his poor health (tuberculosis and [[heart disease]]), was released from exile and allowed to leave Russia.  In early 1868 he went with his son Konrad to [[Lviv]], in [[Austria]]n-occupied Poland.  A year later they moved to [[Kraków]], likewise in Austrian Poland, where Apollo could work with the recently founded democratic daily, ''Kraj'' (''Homeland'').<ref name="Taborski 168" />

On 23 May 1869, Korzeniowski died in Kraków.  He was interred in the [[Rakowicki Cemetery]].  Over his grave stands a monument designed by sculptor Walery Gadomski.<ref name="Taborski 168" />

==Legacy==
Apollo Korzeniowski was long remembered merely as the father of English-language novelist [[Joseph Conrad]]. Only with the astonishing [[world premiere]] of Apollo's ''Comedy'' in [[Wrocław]] in 1952, nearly a century after its 1854 composition, was attention brought to Apollo Korzeniowski as an important literary personality and man of action in his own right.<ref name="Taborski 168" />

About two weeks before his death, Korzeniowski supervised the burning of all the manuscripts of his own work that he had in his possession. His son recalled: "I happened to go into his room a little earlier than usual that evening, and remaining unnoticed, stayed to watch the nursing-sister feeding the blaze in the fire-place."<ref>{{Citation|last=Conrad|first=Joseph|title=A Personal Record|publisher=J. M. Dent & Sons Ltd.|location=London|year=1919|pages=xvi|chapter=Author's Note}}</ref> However, a few manuscripts and a series of letters written before and during his exile to his most intimate friends survived in the possession of others.
