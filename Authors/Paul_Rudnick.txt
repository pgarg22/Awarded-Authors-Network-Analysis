'''Paul Rudnick'''<ref>{{cite book|first=Lisa|last=Birnbach|title=True Prep: It's a Whole New Old World|year=2010|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|location=New York City|page=[https://archive.org/details/trueprepitswhole00birn/page/33 33]|isbn=978-0-307-59398-6|url=https://archive.org/details/trueprepitswhole00birn/page/33}}</ref> (born December 29, 1957) is an American writer. His plays have been produced both on and off [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and around the world. He is also known for having written the screenplays for several movies, including ''[[Sister Act]]'', ''[[Addams Family Values]]'', [[Jeffrey (1995 film)|''Jeffrey'']], and [[In & Out (film)|''In & Out'']].

[[Ben Brantley]], when reviewing Rudnick's ''The Most Fabulous Story Ever Told'' in ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote that, "Line by line, Mr. Rudnick may be the funniest writer for the stage in the United States today."

== Early life ==
Rudnick was born and raised in a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family in [[Piscataway, New Jersey]],<ref>{{Cite news|last=Bruni|first=Frank|date=1997-09-11|title=AT HOME WITH: Paul Rudnick; You Want Gay Role Models?

Rudnick attended [[Piscataway High School]].<ref>Grzella, Paul C. [https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/144281117/ "'Shudder' Big; Comedy will out in Rudnick's latest"], ''[[Asbury Park Press]]'', September 27, 2009.Accessed February 23, 2021, via [[Newspapers.com]]. "LaDonna Racyk was a sexy, "sort of white," teenaged Tina Turner who was a classmate of writer Paul Rudnick at Piscataway High School several decades ago."</ref> He attended [[Yale College]] before moving to [[New York City]], where he wrote book jacket copy and worked as an assistant to his friend, the [[costume designer]] [[William Ivey Long]]. Rudnick began writing for magazines, including ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' and ''[[Spy (magazine)|Spy]]''.

==Plays and novels==
Rudnick's first play was ''[[Poor Little Lambs]]'', a comedy about a female Yale student's attempt to join [[The Whiffenpoofs]], an all-male singing group. The play's cast included the young [[Kevin Bacon]], [[Bronson Pinchot]], and [[Blanche Baker]]. Rudnick then wrote two novels: ''Social Disease'', a [[satire|satiric]] tale of New York nightlife in the vein of [[Evelyn Waugh]]'s ''[[Vile Bodies]]'', and ''I'll Take It'', which was a tribute to Rudnick's mother and aunts and their passionate love of shopping. The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' called the book "absolutely hysterical", and ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' termed it "Flat out hilarious. Sort of what I imagine [[P. G. Wodehouse]] would have written after spending some time in [[Bloomingdale's]]."

In the late 1980s Rudnick moved into the top floor of a [[Greenwich Village]] brownstone, which had once been the 1920s home of the actor [[John Barrymore]]. This inspired Rudnick's play ''[[I Hate Hamlet]]'', about a young TV star who, as he's about to play [[Hamlet]], is visited by the ghost of Barrymore. The play was produced on Broadway and became notorious when [[Nicol Williamson]], the actor playing Barrymore, began attacking his co-star in a far-too-realistic manner during a [[dueling]] scene.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Witchel|first=Alex|date=1991-05-04|title=I Hate Hamlet' Co-Star Walks Out|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/04/theater/i-hate-hamlet-co-star-walks-out.html|url-status=live|access-date=2021-03-29|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

In 1993 Rudnick had a breakthrough with his Off-Broadway hit ''[[Jeffrey (play)|Jeffrey]]''. At first no theater would produce the play, because it was described as a comedy about [[AIDS]]. But after a sold-out run at the tiny WPA Theater in New York City, the show transferred for a commercial run. The play ran from December 31, 1992, to February 14, 1993, at the WPA Theatre.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Jeffrey|url=http://www.iobdb.com/Production/883|url-status=live|access-date=2021-03-29|website=Internet Off-Broadway Database}}</ref> The play transferred to the 
Off-Broadway [[Minetta Lane Theatre]], running from March 6, 1993, to January 16, 1994.<ref>[http://www.lortel.org/Archives/Production/1035 " ''Jeffrey'' Minetta"] lortel.org, retrieved January 27, 2017</ref> [[Frank Rich]], in ''[[The New York Times]]'', called Rudnick "a born show-biz wit with perfect pitch for priceless [[one-line joke|one-liners]]".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Rich|first=Frank|date=1993-02-03|title=Critic's Notebook; Laughing at AIDS Is First Line of Defense|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/03/theater/critic-s-notebook-laughing-at-aids-is-first-line-of-defense.html|url-status=live|access-date=2021-03-29|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> [[Stephen Holden]], also in the ''Times'', said that ''Jeffrey'' was "Just the sort of play [[Oscar Wilde]] might have written had he lived in 1990s [[Manhattan]]."<ref>{{cite web|author=Holden, Stephen|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/21/theater/review-theater-laughs-that-mask-the-fears-of-gay-manhattan.html|title=Review/Theater; Laughs That Mask the Fears of Gay Manhattan|work=The New York Times|date=January 21, 1993|access-date=January 27, 2017}}</ref> Rudnick won an [[Obie Award]], an [[Outer Critics Circle Award]], and the John Gassner Playwrighting Award.<ref name=":0" /> The original cast featured [[John Michael Higgins]] as Jeffrey, [[Edward Hibbert]], [[Bryan Batt]], and [[Harriet Harris]] and was directed by [[Christopher Ashley]].

Rudnick's later plays included ''The Naked Eye'', which depicted an extreme photographer along the lines of [[Robert Mapplethorpe]], and in 1998, ''The Most Fabulous Story Ever Told'', which was inspired by the fundamentalist remark, "[[God]] made [[Adam and Eve]], not Adam and Steve." In Rudnick's revisionist take on the [[Bible]], God makes Adam and Steve, along with the first [[lesbian]]s, Jane and Mabel. While the play was protested by religious groups, it moved for a commercial run, and the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' said, "You will find yourself laughing uncontrollably throughout the evening."

Rudnick also wrote ''Valhalla'', an epic which entwined the lives of a [[World War II]] soldier from [[Texas]] with Ludwig, the Mad King of [[Bavaria]]; ''Regrets Only'', a [[Drawing room play|drawing room comedy]] starring [[Christine Baranski]] and [[George Grizzard]]; and ''The New Century'', a collection of related one-acts, which was produced at [[Lincoln Center]] and for which the actress [[Linda Lavin]] won a Drama Desk Award. Rudnick has more recently contributed two pieces, ''The Gay Agenda'' and ''My Husband'', to the Off-Broadway anthology ''Standing on Ceremony: The Gay Marriage Plays''. ''My Husband'' was released by Playing on Air as a radio play on podcast and public radio featuring [[Michael Urie]] and [[Harriet Sansom Harris|Harriet Harris]], directed by [[Claudia Weill]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=MY HUSBAND by Paul Rudnick|url=https://playingonair.org/new-releases/my-husband-rerelease|url-status=live|access-date=2021-03-29|website=Playing on Air}}</ref>

In September 2017, Rudnick's play ''Big Night'' opened at the Kirk Douglas Theatre in Los Angeles, where it played through October. [[Wendie Malick]] starred in this Oscar-themed tragicomedy, described by ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' as "an often amusing but mostly muddled ensemble piece."<ref>{{cite web|author=Riefe|first=Jordan|date=September 18, 2017|title='Big Night': Theater Review|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/big-night-theater-1040226|url-status=live|access-date=March 24, 2019|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref>

Rudnick's new play ''Guilty Pleasure'' was scheduled to be produced at the [[La Jolla Playhouse]] in the Fall of 2020, but due to the pandemic, will premiere the following Fall, to be directed by Christopher Ashley.

==Screenwriting==
Rudnick has worked as an uncredited script doctor on films including ''[[The Addams Family (1991 film)|The Addams Family]]'' and ''[[The First Wives Club]]''. He was credited as the [[pseudonym]] "Joseph Howard" for his work on ''[[Sister Act]]'', which was originally intended as a vehicle for [[Bette Midler]]; the screenplay went through many changes, and by the time it became re-fashioned for [[Whoopi Goldberg]] he refused to have his real name associated with it. He received sole writing credit for ''[[Addams Family Values]]'', ''[[In & Out (film)|In & Out]]'', and the [[Jeffrey (1995 film)|screen version]] of his play ''Jeffrey''. Rudnick's later screenwriting forays included ''[[Isn't She Great]]'' and the [[The Stepford Wives (2004 film)|2004 remake]] of ''[[The Stepford Wives (1975 film)|The Stepford Wives]]''. His script ''[[Coastal Elites]]''––a socially-distanced film about the COVID-19 pandemic––was directed by [[Jay Roach]] and stars [[Bette Midler]], [[Dan Levy (Canadian actor)|Dan Levy]], [[Issa Rae]], [[Sarah Paulson]], and [[Kaitlyn Dever]]. It began airing on HBO on September 12, 2020.

==Other writing==
In 2011, HarperCollins published ''I Shudder'', a collection of Rudnick's autobiographical essays, some covering his work on stage and screen, interspersed with fictional pieces depicting Elyot Vionnet, a fictional alter-ego. Since 1998, Rudnick has been a frequent contributor to ''[[The New Yorker]]'', mostly of over 50 short humor pieces. His work appears in the collections ''Fierce Pajamas'' and ''Disquiet, Please''.

In 1988, Rudnick began producing satiric film criticism for ''Premiere Magazine'' under the name Libby Gelman-Waxner, a deranged Manhattan wife, mother and "Assistant Buyer of Juniors Activewear." A collection of Libby's columns was published in 1994 under the title ''If You Ask Me'', and [[Janet Maslin]], in ''The New York Times'', wrote that, "Mr. Rudnick weaves many a trenchant thought into Libby's comic screeds." ''Premiere'' folded in 2007, but Libby resumed writing a monthly column for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' in 2011 and occasionally contributes reviews to ''[[The New Yorker]]''.

On May 1, 2013, Scholastic published ''Gorgeous'', Rudnick's first young adult novel. ''Publishers Weekly'', in a starred review, said that the book included "writing that's hilarious, profane and profound (often within a single sentence.)" Scholastic also published his second Young Adult novel, ''It's All Your Fault'', which Booklist called "A laugh-out-loud, irreverent tale built on as much snarkiness as sweetness. A riotously good read." His latest novel, ''Playing The Palace'', was published by Berkley on May 25, 2021. The New York Times said, "In Rudnick's effervescent new novel the question isn't whether love will triumph, only how. The answer may make you cheer." Booklist said ''Playing The Palace'' is "a fizzy, fun, fresh and fairy-tale like rom-com that will restore readers' faith in true love."

Rudnick is co-writing the book, with Kate Wetherhead, for a Broadway musical adaptation of ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (novel)#Musical|The Devil Wears Prada]],'' which is slated to premiere in Chicago in Summer 2021 prior to a Broadway production. The musical's creative team also includes [[Elton John]] (composer), [[Shaina Taub]] (lyricist), and [[Anna D. Shapiro]] (director).<ref>Blistein, Jon.
