'''Ilona Andrews''' is the [[pen name]] of Ilona Gordon and Andrew Gordon,<ref name="What is Gordon Andrews' Real Name?">[https://web.archive.org/web/20161014071406/https://apromontoryfirst.wordpress.com/2011/12/02/what-is-gordon-andrews-real-name/ "Ilona Andrews"]. 2011-12-02.</ref> an American husband-and-wife duo who write [[urban fantasy]] and [[romantic fiction]] together.

==Early lives==
Ilona was born in the [[Soviet Union]] and came to the [[United States]] as a teenager.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} She attended [[Western Carolina University]], where she majored in [[biochemistry]] and met her husband Andrew Gordon.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Career==
Ilona and Gordon (Andrew) are a husband and wife writing team, with their books published as a portmanteau of their first names. Gordon helped Ilona write and submit her first novel, ''Magic Bites''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Scott|first1=Veronica|title=Interview: Gordon and Ilona of Ilona Andrews on 'Magic Binds,' mythology and more|url=http://happyeverafter.usatoday.com/2016/09/20/veronica-scott-ilona-andrews-interview-magic-binds/|website=Happy Ever After|date=20 September 2016}}</ref>  Its sequel, ''Magic Burns'', reached #32 on the ''[[New York Times]]'' extended [[New York Times Best Seller list|bestseller list]] in April 2008.<ref name="Reviews and Awards">{{cite web|title=Reviews and Awards|url=http://www.ilona-andrews.com/about/reviews-and-awards/|website=www.ilona-andrews.com|accessdate=13 January 2015}}</ref> The books in their various series continue to enjoy success.

==Personal lives==
The Gordons live in [[Texas]].<ref name="press kit">{{cite web|title=Press Kit|url=http://www.ilona-andrews.com/about/press-kit/|website=www.ilona-andrews.com|accessdate=13 January 2015}}</ref> They have two daughters (known as Kid 1 and Kid 2 on their forums).

Some confusion has been generated by the fact that Andrew Gordon is usually referred to by his surname. Regarding this, he has said, "I know it can be confusing, but here is the deal: My legal or if you prefer, government name, is Andrew Beauregard Gordon. Andrews is my grandmother Helen’s maiden name and my middle name comes from the confederate general PGT Beauregard who fired on Fort Sumter and basically started our Civil War. Ilona calls me Gordon and that is how I think of myself, in the military we always used our last names."<ref name="What is Gordon Andrews' Real Name?"/>

In the lively comments sections of their website, in which Ilona actively participates daily, they are known as Ilona or Gordon if one is referring to either individually and previously "the ALs" (Author Lords) collectively. However, on August 1, 2019 Ilona and Gordon, who stated that they were never quite comfortable with the "Author Lords" nickname, requested "We would like to be addressed as IA collectively or House Andrews, if you guys would like to go with a fun nickname."<ref>http://www.ilona-andrews.com/new-nickname-has-been-chosen-and-innkeeper-audio-update/ {{dead link|date=August 2021}}</ref>

==Works==

=== Kate Daniels===
The Kate Daniels novels are set in a slightly futuristic Atlanta, where magic and tech periods follow one another. During tech, guns and cars work. During magic, planes fall from the sky and generally anything technological fails but forgotten magic spells work again. In this world, magical creatures again roam the lands. Heroine Kate Daniels is a mercenary who fights various types of monsters. Kate is special: she is a human with some magical abilities but foremost, she is a great warrior.

===The Edge===
The Edge world is in between the 'normal' earth and a magical world that looks remarkably the same. It's a small piece of land where some things are magical and some are not. Most people on either side cannot go across a border, so the edgers are generally left alone. But the few people that can cross borders cause trouble.

===Innkeeper Chronicles===
Earth, as we know it, is a busy way-station for extraterrestrials due to the solar system having an unusually large number of "jump points".  However, the people of Earth don't know about other worlds or aliens yet, so by intergalactic treaty Earth is designated neutral territory and visiting aliens must stay at the Inns and cannot reveal themselves to the native inhabitants.

Innkeepers have a symbiotic relationship with their Inn; a living, semi-sentient and probably alien lifeform. They are powerful within Inn grounds and can use their "magic" to control every part of the Inn and grounds - including creating additional customized rooms for guests just by a thought and opening portals to other worlds their Inn has forged a connection to. The inside of an Inn bends physics to extreme lengths. Their purpose is twofold: protecting their guests at all costs, and maintaining the ignorance of Earth's people to the existence of alien cultures.

Dina Demille comes from a family of Innkeepers and recently woke her own Inn, Gertrude Hunt, from hibernation. As Gertrude Hunt is comparatively unknown, getting visitors and keeping a thriving Inn is tough. Fortunately, Dina is also tough and goes to extremes to make her visitors happy, whilst keeping the true nature of the Inn a secret from the local population.

The Innkeeper books are posted freely online as a weekly series of partial chapters on the Ilona Andrews website. When a book is finished the chapters stay online for a short while then are taken down and become a first-draft, edited and published as a novel.

Due to the weekly format the comments sections of each chapter are very lively with speculation as to what comes next.

Ilona and Gordon have dubbed their fans in the comments sections, especially of Innkeeper, the Book Devouring Horde (BDH) - a play on the Hope Crushing Horde from one of the Innkeeper books. In turn the BDH have historically and playfully referred to them collectively as the ALs (Author Lords). They are now termed House Andrews (another play on words from the books) or IA.
