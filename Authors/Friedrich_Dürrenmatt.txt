}}
'''Friedrich Dürrenmatt''' ({{IPA-de|ˈfriːdrɪç ˈdʏrənˌmat|lang|De-Friedrich Dürrenmatt.ogg}}; 5 January 1921 – 14 December 1990) was a Swiss author and [[dramatist]]. He was a proponent of [[epic theatre]] whose plays reflected the recent experiences of [[World War II]]. The politically active author's work included [[avant-garde]] dramas, philosophical crime novels, and [[macabre]] satire. Dürrenmatt was a member of the [[Gruppe Olten]], a group of left-wing Swiss writers who convened regularly at a restaurant in the city of [[Olten]].

==Early life==
Dürrenmatt was born in [[Konolfingen]], canton of [[Bern]], the son of a [[Swiss Reformed Church|Protestant]] pastor. His grandfather, Ulrich Dürrenmatt, was a conservative politician. The family moved to Bern in 1935. Dürrenmatt began studies in philosophy, [[German studies|German philology]] and [[German literature]] at the [[University of Zürich]] in 1941, but moved to the [[University of Bern]] after one semester where he also studied [[natural science]]. In 1943, he decided to become an author and dramatist and dropped his academic career. In 1945–46, he wrote his first play ''It Is Written''. On 11 October 1946, he married the actress Lotti Geissler. She died on 16 January 1983. Dürrenmatt married another actress, [[Charlotte Kerr]], in 1984.

Dürrenmatt also enjoyed painting. Some of his own works and his drawings were exhibited in [[Neuchâtel]] in 1976 and 1985, as well as in [[Zürich]] in 1978.

==Dramatic works==
Like [[Bertolt Brecht]], Dürrenmatt explored the dramatic possibilities of [[epic theatre]]. Next to Brecht, he has been called its "most original theorist".<ref>{{cite book |first=Christoph |last=Siegrist |chapter=Nationalliterarische Aspekte bei Schweizer Autoren |title=Hansers Sozialgeschichte der deutschen Literatur vom 16. Jahrhundert bis zur Gegenwart |publisher=Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag |location=Munich/Vienna |date=1986 |isbn=978-3-423-04352-6 |volume=10 |page=665 |language=de}}</ref>

When he was 26, his first play, ''It Is Written'', premiered to great controversy. The story of the play revolves around a battle between a sensation-craving cynic and a religious fanatic who takes scripture literally, all of this taking place while the city they live in is under siege. The play's opening night in April 1947, caused fights and protests in the audience. Between 1948 and 1949, Dürrenmatt wrote several segments and sketches for the [[anti-Nazi]] [[Cabaret Cornichon]] in Zürich; among these, the single-act grotesque short play ''Der Gerettete'' (''The Rescued'').<ref name="ReteDueIlSalvato2010">[http://retedue.rsi.ch/home/networks/retedue/colpodiscena/2010/12/10/il-salvato.html ''RSI Il Salvato, di Friederich Dürrenmatt''], for [[Rete Due]], ''Colpo di scena'', December 2010</ref>

His first major success was the play ''Romulus the Great''. Set in the year A.D. 476, the play explores the last days of the [[Roman Empire]], presided over, and brought about by its last emperor, [[Romulus Augustulus|Romulus]]. ''[[The Visit (play)|The Visit]]'' (''Der Besuch der alten Dame'', 1956) is a [[grotesque]] fusion of comedy and tragedy about a wealthy woman who offers the people of her hometown a fortune if they will execute the man who jilted her years earlier. The satirical drama ''[[The Physicists]]'' (''Die Physiker'', 1962), which deals with issues concerning science and its responsibility for dramatic and dangerous changes to the world, has also been presented in translation.

Radio plays published in English include ''Hercules in the Augean Stables'' (''Herkules und der Stall des Augias'', 1954), ''Incident at Twilight'' (''Abendstunde im Spätherbst'', 1952) and ''The Mission of the Vega'' (''Das Unternehmen der Wega'', 1954). The two late works ''Labyrinth'' and ''Turmbau zu Babel'' are a collection of unfinished ideas, stories, and philosophical thoughts.

In 1990, he gave two famous speeches, one in honour of [[Václav Havel]] ("Die Schweiz, ein Gefängnis?/Switzerland a Prison?"), upon discovering he had been spied for five decades, along with 800,000 of his left-leaning fellow citizens, by the Swiss secret service;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-secret-service-spied-on-duerrenmatt/46681496|title=Swiss secret service spied on Dürrenmatt}}</ref>  the other in honour of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] ("Kants Hoffnung/[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s Hope"). Dürrenmatt often compared the three [[Abrahamic religions]] and [[Marxism]], which he also saw as a religion.

He traveled in 1969 to the [[United States]], in 1974 to [[Israel]], and in 1990 to [[Auschwitz]] in [[Poland]].

Dürrenmatt died from [[congestive heart failure|heart failure]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/fdurren.htm |title=Friedrich Dürrenmatt |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223120107/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/fdurren.htm |archive-date=23 February 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> on 14 December 1990 in [[Neuchâtel]].
