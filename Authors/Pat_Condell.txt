In early 2007 he began uploading to the [[internet]] short filmed [[monologue]] [[polemic]]s primarily about religious authority, [[authoritarianism]] in government and [[left-wing politics]], and the societal effects of [[Muslim]] immigration into Europe, which have featured on the front pages of websites such as [[YouTube]] and [[LiveLeak]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}} They have also been published on DVD, and also as a book of video transcripts.

Condell was educated in several different [[Church of England]] schools in [[South London]], saying of this time, "I found myself segregated in assembly and shunted into another room while everyone said their morning prayers. The whole pantomime seemed hollow to me even then. Once you become aware of the gulf between what people profess to believe and how they actually behave, it's hard to take any of it seriously."<ref name="time-out-london"/>

Condell left school at 16. His first job was as a dish-washer in the revolving restaurant on top of the Post Office Tower, now known as the [[BT Tower]] in London, for five shillings an hour. He became a [[vegetarian]] in 1976 after watching a deer being butchered.<ref>{{cite web

Condell also received criticism after links to his monologue titled ''The Trouble with Islam'' were circulated to commissioners in the California city of [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]'s Peace and Justice Commission. Condell said in the video that Islam is "a religion of war", that "Muslim women in Britain who cover their faces are mentally ill", though in some parts of the world women have no choice but to cover their face, as they are "governed...by primitive pigs whose only achievement in life is to be born with a penis in one hand and a [[Qur'an]] in the other". Commissioner Elliot Cohen described Condell's comments as "insulting, degenerating and racist".<ref name="chortle1">{{cite web

Condell then accused Cohen of being "motivated by his own narrow personal and political agenda which has nothing to do with [Condell] or the video clip". The video was initially sent to them by fellow Peace and Justice Commissioner Jonathan Wornick, who said it "tries to expose intolerance in the [[Muslim world]]", such as "the intolerance of [[Islamism|radical Islamists]] who say if you insult Allah, you should have your head cut off".<ref name="berekely2">{{cite news

===YouTube video removals===
{{See also|Criticism of Google#YouTube}}
Condell's video ''Welcome to Saudi Britain'' was removed by YouTube early in October 2008, but reinstated shortly after. In it Condell criticises Britain's sanctioning of a [[Sharia]] court, and refers to the entire country of [[Saudi Arabia]] as "mentally ill" for [[Women's rights in Saudi Arabia|its abuse of women]].<ref name="telegraphcensor" /><ref name="rdcensor" />

A YouTube spokesman said "YouTube has clear policies that prohibit inappropriate content on the site, such as pornography, gratuitous violence or hate speech.... If users repeatedly break these rules we disable their accounts." The [[National Secular Society]] was among the complainants to YouTube, saying "as usual, he (Condell) does not mince his words, but he is not saying anything that is untrue. His main thrust is one of outrage on behalf of those Muslim women who will suffer because they are forced to have their marital problems solved in a male-dominated Sharia court."<ref name="telegraphcensor">{{cite web

Shortly after, YouTube reversed its earlier decision, saying, "Upon further review of the context of Pat Condell's comments, we've reinstated it." [[Richard Dawkins]] applauded the reversal, saying "I congratulate YouTube on an excellent decision. Pat Condell is hard-hitting, but always quietly reasonable in tone."<ref name="rdcensor">{{cite web

YouTube also briefly removed Condell's video ''Godless and Free'' but then restored it, emailing Condell and explaining that it had been removed erroneously.<ref name="adinterview" />
