'''Joan Delano Aiken''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|MBE}} (4 September 1924 – 4 January 2004) was an [[English people|English]] writer specialising in [[supernatural fiction]] and [[children's literature|children's]] [[alternate history|alternative history]] novels. In 1999 she was awarded an MBE for her services to children's literature.<ref name="independent" /> For ''The Whispering Mountain'', published by Jonathan Cape in 1968, she won the [[Guardian Children's Fiction Prize]], a once-in-a-lifetime book award judged by a panel of British children's writers,<ref name="relaunch" /> and she was a commended runner-up for the [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] from the [[CILIP|Library Association]], recognising the year's best children's book by a British writer.<ref name="ccsu" />{{efn|name=HC}} She won an [[List of Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best Juvenile winners|Edgar Allan Poe Award]] (1972) for ''Night Fall''.

==Biography==
Aiken was born in Mermaid Street in [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye]], Sussex, on 4 September 1924.<ref name="Orlando" /> Her father was the American [[Pulitzer Prize]]–winning poet [[Conrad Aiken]] (1889–1973). Her older brother was the writer and research chemist<ref name="scifi" /> John Aiken (1913–1990), and her older sister was the writer [[Jane Aiken Hodge]] (1917–2009).  Their mother, Canadian-born Jessie MacDonald (1889–1970), was a Master's graduate from [[Radcliffe College]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. Jessie and Conrad's marriage was dissolved in 1929, and Jessie married the English writer [[Martin Armstrong (writer)|Martin Armstrong]] in 1930. Conrad Aiken went on to marry twice more.  Together with her brother John and her sister Jane, Joan Aiken wrote ''Conrad Aiken Remembered'' (1989), a short appreciation of their father.

Aiken was taught at home by her mother until the age of twelve and from 1936 to 1940 at [[Wychwood School]] for girls in [[North Oxford]]. She did not attend university. Writing stories from an early age, she finished her first full-length novel when she was sixteen and had her first short story for adults accepted for publication when she was seventeen.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}  In 1941 her first children's story was broadcast on the [[BBC]]'s [[Children's Hour]].<ref name="JE2002" />

Aiken worked for the [[United Nations Information Centre]] (UNIC) in London between 1943 and 1949.  In September 1945 she married Ronald George Brown,<ref name="Orlando" /> a journalist who was also working at UNIC. They had two children before he died in 1955.

After her husband's death, Aiken joined the magazine ''[[Argosy (UK magazine)|Argosy]]'', where she worked in various editorial capacities and, she later said, learned her trade as a writer. The magazine was one of many in which she published short stories between 1955 and 1960. During this time she also published her first two collections of children's stories and began work on a children's novel, initially titled ''Bonnie Green'', which was later published in 1962 as ''[[The Wolves of Willoughby Chase]]''. By then she was able to write full-time from home, producing two or three books a year for the rest of her life, mainly children's books and thrillers, as well as many articles, introductions and talks on children's literature and on the work of [[Jane Austen]].

Aiken married the New York landscape painter and teacher Julius Goldstein in 1976.<ref name="Orlando" /> They divided their time between her home, the Hermitage in [[Petworth]], Sussex, and New York.  He died in 2001.

In September 1999, Aiken was made a [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]].<ref name="Orlando" />

Aiken died at home at the age of 79 in 2004.<ref name="Orlando" /> She was survived by her two children.

== Writings ==
Joan Aiken produced more than a hundred books, including more than a dozen collections of fantasy stories, plays and poems, and modern and historical novels for adults and children. She was a lifelong fan of [[Ghost story|ghost stories]], particularly those of [[M. R. James]], [[Fitz James O'Brien]] and [[Nugent Barker]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} As well as writing under her own name, she used the pen name Nicholas Dee for several short stories.

Some of her books focus on spine-chilling or supernatural events, including ''The Windscreen Weepers'' (stories, 1969), ''The Shadow Guests'' (novel, 1980), ''A Whisper in the Night'' (stories, 1982), and ''A Creepy Company'' (stories, 1993, with variant contents in its US and UK editions). She set her adult supernatural novel ''The Haunting of Lamb House'' at [[Lamb House]] in Rye (now a [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] property). This ghost story recounts in fictional form an alleged haunting experienced by two former residents of the house, [[Henry James]] and [[E. F. Benson]], both of whom also wrote ghost stories.

Many of Aiken's most popular books, including the Wolves Chronicles<ref name="isfdb-series" /> (also known as ''[[The Wolves of Willoughby Chase]]'' series or the James III series), are set in an elaborate alternative history of Britain in which [[James II of England|James II]] was never deposed in the [[Glorious Revolution]], but supporters of the [[House of Hanover]] continually agitate against the monarchy. These books also toy with the geography of London, adding a Canal District among other features. Wolves have invaded the country from Europe via the newly built Channel Tunnel. The novels share a varying cast and a variety of interlinked child protagonists – initially Bonnie Green, but subsequently her itinerant friend Simon, Simon's intrepid Cockney friend Dido Twite (the heroine of most of the books), Dido's half-sister Is and Owen Hughes (son of Dido's Royal Navy ally Captain Hughes).

In a review of ''Midwinter Nightingale'' for the [[School Library Journal]], Susan Patron praised the characterisations and the suspenseful plot and noted that "although the titles in the 'Wolves' series may be read independently", readers may want to read the earlier books first.<ref name="patron" />

Aiken's series of children's books about Arabel and Mortimer were illustrated by [[Quentin Blake]]. Others were illustrated by [[Jan Pieńkowski]] and Pat Marriott. Pieńkowski won the foremost British award for children's book illustration, the [[Greenaway Medal]], for ''The Kingdom Under the Sea and Other Stories'' (Jonathan Cape, 1971), a collection of "unique fairy tales from Eastern Europe and Russia" retold by Aiken.<ref name="greenaway1971" />

Aiken participated in the [[Puffin Books|Puffin]] Book Club's annual Children's Literature Summer Camp, run by Colony Holidays, predecessor to [[ATE Superweeks]], along with other popular children's authors such as [[Ian Serraillier]] and [[Clive King]].<ref name="green" />

Aiken's many novels for adults include several that continue or complement novels by [[Jane Austen]]. These include ''Mansfield Revisited'' and ''Jane Fairfax''.

== Selected works ==
===Wolves Chronicles===
The Wolves Chronicles vary in length from less than 150 pages to more than 250 pages.<ref name="isfdb-series" /> Here the novels are listed in narrative order, and their central characters.

====Related novels====

This novel evidently takes place in the same fictional world as the series. Blastburn, the fictional setting of this work, features as the location of Mrs. Brisket's orphanage in ''[[The Wolves of Willoughby Chase]]'', but does not otherwise bring elements of the other books. Its setting and time period resemble and satirise the height of the Victorian manufacturing years, rather than the Georgian setting of the other books. "Joan Aiken follows all the conventions of Dickensian fiction with just a little extra to satisfy jaded contemporary tastes. The Grimsby mansion at Midnight Court houses not one, but two unjustly disinherited orphans&nbsp;...".<ref name="midnight" />
