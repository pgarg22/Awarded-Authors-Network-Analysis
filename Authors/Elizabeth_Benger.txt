==Early life and education==
Elizabeth was the daughter of John Benger or Benjey and his wife Mary, née Long. Her father was a tradesman in [[Wells, Somerset|Wells]]. He became a [[Royal Navy]] [[purser]] in 1782 and the family lived mainly in [[Chatham, Kent]] until 1797.<ref>http://www.mocavo.com/Dictionary-of-National-Biography-Volume-4/351511/234</ref> According to a fellow writer, [[Lucy Aikin]], Elizabeth early showed "an ardour for knowledge, a passion for literature". She was allowed at the age of twelve to attend a local boys' school to learn Latin,<ref>L. Aikin: "Memoir of Miss Benger" In:''Memoirs, Miscellanies, and Letters...'' (London: Longman, 1864).

Hookham etc., 1791).</ref> This featured "female theologians, scholars, and preachers such as Cassandra del Fides, [[Isabella Roser|Isabella of Barcelona]], and Issona of Verona, alongside [[Anesius|Cornelia]], as historic women to inspire 'the British fair' of her day."<ref>Emma Major: Madam Britannia. Women, Church, & Nation 1712–1812. (Oxford: OUP, 2012), p. 313.

==Career==
[[poverty|Impoverished]] after the death of her father in 1796, the family moved to [[Devizes]], [[Wiltshire]], and then to London in 1802, where Benger made the acquaintance of several literary figures. These included the novelists [[Jane Porter|Jane]] and [[Anna Maria Porter]], and the poet [[Caroline de Crespigny|Caroline Champion de Crespigny]], a former mistress of [[Lord Byron]]. She later became known to [[John Aikin]] and his daughter Lucy, the poet and children's writer [[Anna Laetitia Barbauld]], Sarah Wesley, the writer daughter of the prominent [[Methodism|Methodist]] [[Charles Wesley]], and the novelist and actress [[Elizabeth Inchbald]]. She made a poorer impression on [[Charles Lamb|Charles]] and [[Mary Lamb]],<ref>''Letters of Charles and Mary Lamb'', ed. E. W. Marrs, Vol 1 (Ithaca, NY/London: Cornell UP, 1975), p. 198.</ref> and on the diarist [[Henry Crabb Robinson]], who described her as "ludicrously fidgety" at a party where [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] was present.<ref>ODNB entry.</ref>

Elizabeth wanted to become a playwright, but she had no success and soon turned to poetry with a social message. "The Abolition of the Slave Trade" appeared in 1809, with verse by [[James Montgomery (poet)|James Montgomery]] and [[James Grahame]] on the same subject.<ref>''Poems on the Abolition of the Slave Trade'' (London: T. Bensley, 1809).
