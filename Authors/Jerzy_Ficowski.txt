'''Jerzy Tadeusz Ficowski''' ({{IPA-pl|ˈjɛʐɨ fiˈt͡sɔfskʲi}}; October 4, 1924 in [[Warsaw]] – May 9, 2006 in Warsaw) was a Polish poet, writer and translator (from [[Yiddish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Romani language|Romani]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]).

== Biography and works ==
During the [[History of Poland (1939-1945)|German occupation of Poland]] in World War II, Ficowski who lived in [[Włochy]] near Warsaw was a member of the [[Polish resistance in the Second World War|Polish resistance]]. He was a member of the [[Home Army]] (Armia Krajowa, AK), was imprisoned in the infamous [[Pawiak]] and took part in the [[Warsaw Uprising]] of 1944. His codename was ''Wrak'' and he fought in [[Mokotów]] region. Following the [[Warsaw Uprising]], Ficowski entered a camp with other survivors of the battle.

After the war, Ficowski returned to Warsaw and enrolled at the university in order to study philosophy and sociology. There he published his first volume of poetry, ''Ołowiani żołnierze'' (The Tin Soldiers, 1948). This volume reflected the [[Stalinist]] atmosphere of the [[History of Poland (1945-1989)|early postwar Poland]], in which heroes of the Armia Krajowa Warsaw Uprising were treated with suspicion at best, arrested and executed at worst, together with the sense of a new city arising from the ashes of the old.

His early works show the influence of [[Julian Tuwim]]. Later he became interested in the poems of the [[History of Poland (1918-1939)|interwar period]], with elements of [[fantasy]] and [[grotesque]].  In the later period his poems reflected various moral and social aspects of life in the [[People's Republic of Poland]].

From 1948 to 1950 Ficowski chose to travel with Polish [[Romani people|Gypsies]] and came to write several volumes on or inspired by the Roma way of life, including ''Amulety i defilacje'' (Amulets and Definitions, 1960) and ''Cyganie na polskich drogach'' (Gypsies on the Polish Roads, 1965). He was the member of the [[Gypsy Lore Society]] and translated the poems of [[Bronisława Wajs]] (''Papusza''). He was interested in many aspects of international poetry. He translated the poems of the [[Spain|Spanish]] poet, [[Federico García Lorca]], and he was also a known specialist of [[Jewish folklore]] and [[Modern Hebrew poetry]], becoming an editor of the Jewish poem anthology  ''Rodzynki z migdałami'' (Raisins with Almonds, 1964).

Ficowski devoted many years of his life to the study of the life and works of [[Bruno Schulz]], and in 1967 published the first edition of what is considered the definitive biography of him, entitled ''Regions of the Great Heresy''. He received the award of the Polish [[Pen Club]] in 1977. His 1979 collection of poems, ''A Reading of Ashes'', has been called the most moving account of the [[Holocaust]] written by a non-Jew.[https://web.archive.org/web/20060921002300/http://www.traktor.cz/twisted/ficowski.html]

As a consequence of his signing, in 1975, of the [[letter of 59]], practically all of Ficowski's writings had become banned in Poland for the remainder of the decade, and only the emergence of [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] in the early 1980s has brought his works back to Poland's bookshelves. Both his prose and poems continued to be widely translated in [[Western world|the West]]. He was active in the opposition movement, and was a member of the [[Workers' Defence Committee]] (Komitet Obrony Robotników, KOR) and subsequently of the [[Committee for Social Self-defence KOR]].

Under the communist regime he had urged his fellow writers to voice their concerns over [[censorship]] and the suppression of workers. His most public statement was a letter to the Writers Union in which he said, "I do not believe deeply in the immediate effectiveness of letters to the government, but even less do I believe in the effectiveness of silence."

Following the [[fall of communism]], liberalisation of Poland and its breaking with the [[Soviet bloc]], Ficowski continued to write and translate works from languages as diverse as [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian]], not to mention the Yiddish and [[Roma language]]s that had always fascinated him.
