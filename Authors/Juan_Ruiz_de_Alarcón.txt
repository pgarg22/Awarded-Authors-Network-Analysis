'''Juan Ruiz de Alarcón''' (c. 1581 - 4 August 1639) was a [[New Spain]]-born Spanish writer of the [[Spanish Golden Age|Golden Age]] who cultivated different  variants of [[dramaturgy]]. His works include the comedy ''[[La verdad sospechosa]]'' ([[:es:La verdad sospechosa|es]]), which is considered a masterpiece of Latin American [[Baroque]] theater.

== Family ==
Juan Ruiz de Alarcón was born in Real de Taxco, later named [[Taxco de Alarcón]] in his honour. His family was of old [[Asturias|Asturian]] nobility. The name ''Alarcón'' had been given to his ancestor [[:es:Ferren Martínez de Ceballos|Ferren Martínez de Ceballos]] by [[Alfonso VIII of Castile]] after he had successfully driven the [[Moors]] from the fortress of [[Alarcón]] near [[Cuenca, Spain|Cuenca]] in 1177. Juán Ruiz de Alarcón's maternal grandparents Hernando and María de Mendoza were among the first Spaniards to arrive in Mexico in 1535, when they established themselves in Taxco. Their daughter Leonor de Mendoza married Pedro Ruiz de Alarcón who was described as an [[Hidalgo (Spanish nobility)|hidalgo]].

Juan Ruiz de Alarcón had four brothers: Pedro Ruiz de Alarcón, who was rector at the [[Saint John Lateran|College of Saint John Lateran]], [[Hernando Ruiz de Alarcón]] who was a priest and is known for having written a treatise documenting the non-Christian religious practices of the [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] Indians of central Mexico, Gaspar and García, about whom little is known.

==Life==

Juan Ruiz de Alarcón was born about 1581 at Real de Taxco, New Spain, where his father was superintendent of mines; his mother was descended from one of Spain's most illustrious families, the Mendozas. He was small of stature  and suffered from [[Kyphosis|hunchbackedness]]. Besides,  his  red haired complexion made him an occasional object of  scorn, since some sectors of the conservative  catholic society   in which he later  lived  held the prejudice that  Judas Iscariot was a redhead himself. Because of this, his critics often ridiculed his appearance rather than his works.

He went to [[Spain]] in 1600, where he studied [[law]] at the [[University of Salamanca]]. He continued his studies towards a Licentiate in Law—roughly equivalent to a modern master's degree—which he finished in 1605, without, however, taking the degree. Instead, he practiced law for a while in Seville, then in 1608 went back to Mexico, and in 1609 received the licentiate from the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico|University of Mexico]]. He completed his studies for his doctorate fairly soon thereafter, but never received the degree, in all likelihood because of the rather substantial costs attached to the ceremony. He worked as a legal adviser for a while, as an advocate, and as an interim investigating judge, all the while trying repeatedly and unsuccessfully to gain a teaching chair at the University.

Returning to Spain about 1611, he entered the household of the marquis de Salinas, and began a frustrating life of job-seeking at court. At the same time, purely as a way of making money apparently, he threw himself into the heady literary and theatrical life of the capital, eventually having a number of his plays performed. His first play, ''El semejante de sí mismo'' was unsuccessful, yet it attracted attention to him. By some, he was ridiculed and criticized; from others he obtained support.

For ten years, he pursued this double life, until he finally secured first an interim and then a permanent appointment to the [[Council of the Indies|Royal Council of the Indies]] (1626) — rather like an appeals court for Spanish colonies in America. Apparently, when political success came, he all but stopped his literary efforts—although he did have two volumes of his plays published (in 1628 and 1634), perhaps because some of them had been pirated and previously published with false attributions to his theatrical rival [[Félix Lope de Vega]]. After thirteen years of legal service to the crown, he died at [[Madrid]] in 1639.

==Literary career and importance==
[[File:Parte primera de las comedias de don Juan Ruiz de Alarcón.jpg|thumbnail|left|250px|''First Part of the Comedies of Don Juan Ruiz de Alarcón'', 1628]]

Alarcón was the least prolific of all the great dramatists of Spain and is one of the very few Spanish-Americans among the great dramatists of the ''Siglo de Oro''. He wrote less than did others, and many of his works circulated under their names. He took pains to mull over his plays and polish both their versification and their general composition. [[James Fitzmaurice-Kelly|Fitzmaurice-Kelly]] said of Alarcón: "There are Spanish dramatists greater than Ruiz de Alarcón: there is none whose work is of such even excellence"<ref>Fitzmaurice-Kelly, p. 317.</ref>

[[File:Parte segunda de las comedias del licenciado don Juan Ruiz de Alarcón y Mendoza.png|thumb|''Second part of the comedies of the graduate by Iuan Rvyz de Alarcón y Mendoza, Rapporteur of the Council of the Indies'' (Barcelona, 1634).]]

He is the author of approximately twenty-five plays. Twenty of them were published by the playwright in two volumes. The first, from 1628, contains eight plays (''Los favores del mundo'', ''La industria y la suerte'', ''Las paredes oyen'', ''El semejante a sí mismo'', ''La cueva de Salamanca'', ''Mudarse por mejorarse'', ''Todo es ventura'' and ''El desdichado en fingir''); and the second volume from 1634 consists of twelve plays (''Los empeños de un engaño'', ''El dueño de las estrellas'', ''La amistad castigada'', ''La manganilla de Melilla'', ''Ganar amigos'', ''La verdad sospechosa'', ''El anticristo'', ''El tejedor de Segovia'', ''La prueba de las promesas'', ''Los pechos privilegiados'', ''La crueldad por el honor'' and ''El examen de maridos''). Other plays were published in collections. These include: ''Quien mal anda mal acaba'', ''No hay mal que por bien no venga'' and ''La culpa busca la pena, y el agravio la venganza''. He is also the author of a play written in collaboration, ''Algunas hazañas de las muchas de don García Hurtado de Mendoza'' (1622).<ref>Garza Cuarón, p. 564.</ref>

The most famous of his plays is ''La verdad sospechosa'', (published in 1634). The first great French comedy in modern French literature, [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]]'s [[The Liar (Corneille)|''Le menteur'']] (''The Liar''), was confessedly modeled after it. ''Las paredes oyen'' (''Walls have Ears'') is often seen as a companion-piece since both plays deal with mendacity.<ref>Parr, 1991, pp. 22-36.</ref> His plays can be divided into at least three distinct categories: social comedies, political dramas and plays that dramatize astrology, magic and other occult practices.<ref>Whicker, p. 9.</ref> Among the political plays, ''El dueño de las estrellas'' stands out as a stunning tragedy, dealing with [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]], the Spartan lawgiver. Although the oracle had predicted that he would either kill a king or be killed by one, when faced with the dilemma he commits suicide thus overcoming the power of the stars.<ref>Parr (1974) and Halpern pp. 82-92.</ref> A second political play, ''La amistad castigada'', is unusual because the king is deposed at the end. The magic plays include astonishing instances of the occult at a time when such practices were frowned upon. See, for example, ''La cueva de Salamanca'' and ''La prueba de las promesas''.<ref>On ''La prueba de las promesas'' see Perry.</ref> ''Quien mal anda, mal acaba'' may be the first Spanish play that dramatizes a pact with the devil. Indeed, even in social comedies such as ''Las paredes oyen'' we can encounter extensive astrological allusions.<ref>On the occult in Alarcón see Foley; on astrology see De Armas.</ref>

Embittered by his deformity, Alarcón was constantly engaged in personal quarrels with his rivals; but his attitude in these polemics is always dignified, and his crushing retort to Lope de Vega in ''Los pechos privilegiados'' is an unsurpassed example of cold, scornful invective.

More than any other Spanish dramatist, Alarcón was preoccupied with ethical aims, and his gift of dramatic presentation is as brilliant as his dialogue is natural and vivacious. It has been alleged that his non-Spanish origin is noticeable in his plays, and there is some foundation for the observation; but his workmanship is exceptionally conscientious, and in ''El Tejedor de Segovia'' he produced a masterpiece of national art, national sentiment and national expression.
