[[File:Yamamura Bocō.jpg|thumb|Yamamura Bocō]]
{{nihongo|'''Bochō Yamamura'''|山村 暮鳥|Yamamura Bochō|January 10, 1884 – December 8, 1924}} was a [[Japan]]ese writer, poet and songwriter.

Bochō was born Tsuchida Hakkujū in present-day [[Takasaki, Gunma]]. After a hardship-filled infancy, upon completing his studies, he became a [[Christians|Christian]] preacher. He gained the public's attention thanks to his acutely sensitive poetry. Suffering from [[tuberculosis]], out of work, and living a sad vagabond life, he kept writing poetry, fairy tales and songs for children with a humanity-filled, warm style. In his last years, he composed a number of simply-worded and yet highly inspirational odes to nature.
