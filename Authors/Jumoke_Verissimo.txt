The ''[[Peoples Daily (Nigeria)|Peoples Daily]]''<ref name = UQPProfile>[http://peoplesdailyng.com/the-audacity-of-pain-a-review-of-jumoke-verissimos-i-am-memory Interview on People's Daily Newspaper, Nigeria]</ref>{{dead link|date=November 2021}} describes her collection as "a bold stance of pain and other emotions, filtering through the pores of gross indifference and achieving a communal cry of retrospective protest." ''[[The Punch]]'' also describes her as, "one of those who will change the face of literature in Nigeria", after her first book, which was well-received across the country.  Her works have appeared in ''Migrations'' (Afro-Italian), [[Wole Soyinka]] ed., ''Voldposten 2010'' (Norway), ''Livre d'or de Struga'' (Poetes du monde, sous le patronage de l'UNESCO) and many other prints and online magazines. Some of her poems are in translation in Italian, Norwegian, French, Japanese, Chinese, and Macedonian.{{cn|date=November 2021}} Veissimo's 2019 novel, ''[[A Small Silence]]'' (Cassava Republic) was selected as the winner of the Aidoo-Snyder Prize for best original creative work.
