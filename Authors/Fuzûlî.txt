Often considered one of the greatest contributors to the [[diwan (poetry)|divan tradition]] of [[Azerbaijani literature]], Fuzuli in fact wrote his collected poems (divan) in three different languages: in his native [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]].<ref>Peter Rollberg.

Besides his native Azeri, he learned Arabic and Persian at an early age and acquired a through command of the literatures in all three languages, an accomplishment in which the cosmopolitan literary and scholarly circles of Hilla played an important role.</ref> He was well-versed in both the [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman]] and [[Chagatai language|Chagatai]] Turkic literary traditions as well as [[mathematics]] and [[astronomy]].<ref name="Fozuli, Mohammad b. Solayman">[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/fozuli "Fozuli, Mohammad b. Solayman"] in Encyclopaedia Iranica</ref>

==Life==
Fuzûlî is generally believed to have been born around 1480 in what is now [[Iraq]], when the area was under [[Ak Koyunlu]] [[Turkoman (ethnonym)|Turkmen]] rule; he was probably born in either [[Karbala|Karbalā’]] or [[Najaf|an-Najaf]].<ref name="Fozuli, Mohammad b. Solayman"/> He is believed to belong to [[Bayat (name)|Bayat]] [[tribe]], one of the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[Oghuz Turks|Oghuz]] tribes who are related to Azerbaijanis and were scattered throughout the [[Middle East]], [[Anatolia]], and the [[Caucasus]] at the time.<ref name="TurkishCulturalFoundation" /> Though Fuzûlî's ancestors had been of [[nomad]]ic origin, the family had long since settled in towns.

Fuzûlî appears to have received a good education, first under his father—who was a [[mufti]] in the city of [[Al Hillah]]—and then under a teacher named Rahmetullah.<ref>Şentürk 281</ref> It was during this time that he learned the Persian and Arabic languages in addition to his native Azerbaijani. Fuzûlî showed poetic promise early in life, composing sometime around his twentieth year the important ''[[Masnavi (poetic form)|masnavi]]'' entitled ''Beng ü Bâde'' (بنگ و باده; "Hashish and Wine"), in which he compared the Ottoman [[Sultan]] [[Bayezid II]] to [[hashish]] and the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] [[shah]] [[Ismail I]] to [[wine]], much to the advantage of the latter.

One of the few things that is known of Fuzûlî's life during this time is how he arrived at his pen name. In the introduction to his collected Persian poems, he says: "In the early days when I was just beginning to write poetry, every few days I would set my heart on a particular pen name and then after a time change it for another because someone showed up who shared the same name".<ref>Quoted in Andrews, 236.</ref> Eventually, he decided upon the Arabic word ''fuzûlî''—which literally means "impertinent, improper, unnecessary"—because he "knew that this title would not be acceptable to anyone else".<ref name="auto">''Ibid.''</ref> Despite the name's pejorative meaning, however, it contains a [[Pun|double meaning]]—what is called ''tevriyye'' (توريه) in [[Poetry of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Divan poetry]]—as Fuzûlî himself explains: "I was possessed of all the arts and sciences and found a pen name that also implies this sense since in the dictionary ''fuzûl'' (ﻓﻀﻮل) is given as a plural of ''fazl'' (ﻓﻀﻞ; 'learning') and has the same [[Meter (poetry)#Ottoman Turkish|rhythm]] as ''‘ulûm'' (ﻋﻠﻮم; 'sciences') and ''fünûn'' (ﻓﻨﻮن; 'arts')".<ref name="auto"/>

In 1534, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[sultan]] [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Süleymân I]] conquered the region of [[Baghdad Province, Ottoman Empire|Baghdad]], where Fuzûlî lived, from the Safavid Empire. Fuzûlî now had the chance to become a court poet under the Ottoman [[Patronage|patronage system]], and he composed a number of ''[[Qasida|kasîde]]''s, or [[panegyric]] poems, in praise of the sultan and members of his [[retinue]], and as a result, he was granted a stipend. However, owing to the complexities of the Ottoman [[bureaucracy]], this stipend never materialized. In one of his best-known works, the letter ''Şikâyetnâme'' (شکايت نامه; "Complaint"), Fuzûlî spoke out against such bureaucracy and its attendant [[Political corruption|corruption]]:

:سلام وردم رشوت دگلدر ديو آلمادىلر
:''Selâm verdim rüşvet değildir deyü almadılar.''<ref>Kudret 189</ref>
:I gave my greetings but they didn't receive it as it wasn't a bribe.

Though his poetry flourished during his time among the Ottomans, the loss of his stipend meant that, materially speaking, Fuzûlî never became secure. In fact, most of his life was spent attending upon the [[Imam Ali Mosque|Tomb of `Alî]] in the city of an-Najaf, south of [[Baghdad]].<ref>Andrews 237</ref> He died during a [[Bubonic plague|plague]] outbreak in 1556, in Karbalā’, either of the plague itself or of [[cholera]].

[[File:Fuzuli Divan.jpg|thumb|upright|A page from the collected poems of Fuzûlî]]

Fuzûlî has always been known, first and foremost, as a poet of [[love]]. It was, in fact, a characterization that he seems to have agreed with:

:مندن فضولی ايستمه اشعار مدح و ذم
:من عاشقام هميشه سوزوم عاشقانه دیر

:''Menden Fuzûlî isteme eş'âr-ı medh ü zem''
:''Men âşıkam hemîşe sözüm âşıkânedür''<ref>Tarlan 47</ref>

:Don't ask Fuzûlî for poems of praise or rebuke
:I am a lover and speak only of love

Fuzûlî's notion of love, however, has more in common with the [[Sufism#Basic beliefs|Sufi idea of love]] as a projection of the essence of [[Allah|God]]—though Fuzûlî himself seems to have belonged to no particular [[Tariqah|Sufi order]]—than it does with the [[Western culture|Western]] idea of [[romantic love]]. This can be seen in the following lines from another poem:

:عاشق ايمش هر ن وار ﻋﺎﻝﻢ
:ﻋلم بر قيل و قال ايمش آنجق

:''‘Âşık imiş her ne var ‘âlem''
:''‘İlm bir kîl ü kâl imiş ancak''<ref>Kudret 20</ref>

:All that is in the world is love
:And knowledge is nothing but gossip

The first of these lines, especially, relates to the idea of ''[[Wahdat-ul-Wujood|wahdat al-wujūd]]'' (وحدة الوجود), or "unity of being", which was first formulated by [[Ibn Arabi|Ibn al-‘Arabī]] and which states that nothing apart from various manifestations of God exists. Here, Fuzûlî uses the word "love" (عشق ''‘aşk'') rather than God in the formula, but the effect is the same.

Fuzûlî's most extended treatment of this idea of love is in the long poem ''Dâstân-ı Leylî vü Mecnun'' (داستان ليلى و مجنون), a ''mesnevî'' which takes as its subject the classical Arabian love story of [[Layla and Majnun]]. In his version of the story, Fuzûlî concentrates upon the pain of the mad lover Majnun's separation from his beloved Layla, and comes to see this pain as being of the essence of love.

The ultimate value of the suffering of love, in Fuzûlî's work, lies in that it helps one to approach closer to "the Real" (''al-Haqq'' الحق), which is one of the [[99 Names of God|99 names of God]] in [[Islam]]ic tradition.

According to the ''Encyclopædia Iranica'':{{cquote|Fuzuli is credited with some fifteen works in Arabic, Persian, and Turkic, both in verse and prose. Although his greatest significance is undoubtedly as a Turkic poet, he is also of importance to Persian literature thanks to his original works in that language (indeed, Persian was the language he preferred for his Shi'ite religious poetry); his Turkic adaptations or translations of Persian works; and the inspiration he derived from Persian models for his Turkic works.
...
The fundamental gesture of Fuzûlî's poetry is inclusiveness. It links Azeri, [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] and [[Ottomans|Ottoman]] (Rumi) poetry, east and west; it also bridges the religious divide between [[Shiism]] and [[Sunnism]]. Generations of Ottoman poets admired and wrote responses to his poetry; no contemporary canon can bypass him.}}
