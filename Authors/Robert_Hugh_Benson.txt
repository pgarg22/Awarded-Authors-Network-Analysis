'''Robert Hugh Benson''' [[Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools|AFSC]] [[Order of St. Gregory the Great|KC*SG]] [[Order of the Holy Sepulchre|KGCHS]] (18 November 1871 &ndash; 19 October 1914) was an English Roman Catholic priest and writer. In 1903, Benson, a [[Church of England|Anglican]] priest, was received into the [[Catholic Church]]; he was ordained a [[Catholic priest]] the next year. He was also a prolific writer of fiction, writing the notable dystopian novel ''[[Lord of the World]]'', as well as ''[[Come Rack! Come Rope!]]''. His output encompassed historical, horror and science fiction, contemporary fiction, children's stories, plays, [[apologetics]], devotional works and articles. He continued his writing career at the same time as he progressed through the hierarchy to become a Chamberlain to [[Pope Pius X]] in 1911 and gain the title of [[Monsignor]], before his death a few years later.

== Early life ==
Benson was the youngest son of [[Edward White Benson]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], and his wife, [[Mary Sidgwick Benson|Mary]]; Benson was the younger brother of [[E. F. Benson]], [[A. C. Benson]], and [[Margaret Benson]].<ref name="ma">

Benson was educated at [[Eton College]] and then studied classics and [[Anglican theology|theology]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], from 1890 to 1893.<ref>{{acad|id=BN890RH|name=Benson, Robert Hugh}}</ref>

In 1895, Benson was ordained a priest in the [[Church of England]] by his father, who was the then Archbishop of Canterbury.

==Career==
[[File:Robert Hugh Benson in 1907.jpg|thumb|left|Robert Hugh Benson in 1907]]
After his father died suddenly in 1896, Benson was sent on a trip to the [[Middle East]] to recover his own health. While there he began to question the status of the Church of England and to consider the claims of the [[Catholic Church]]. His own piety began to tend toward the [[High Church]] tradition, and he started exploring [[Anglican religious order|religious life in various Anglican communities]], eventually obtaining permission to join the [[Community of the Resurrection]].

Benson made his profession as a member of the community in 1901, at which time he had no thoughts of leaving the Church of England. As he continued his studies and began writing, however, he became more and more uneasy with his own [[Anglican doctrine|doctrinal position]] and, on 11 September 1903, he was received into the [[Catholic Church]]. Benson was [[Catholic ordination|ordained]] as a Catholic priest in 1904. As the son of the late Archbishop of Canterbury, his conversion, and his subsequent ordination, caused a sensation.<ref>Pearce, Joseph.[http://www.catholicauthors.com/benson.html "R.H. Benson: Unsung Genius", ''Lay Witness'']</ref>

His first assignment was as a college chaplain. He had a stutter and is said to have had a 'reedy' voice. Benson was a popular preacher, attracting large audiences wherever he spoke. In 1914, he visited the [[University of Notre Dame]] and gave an address on the papacy. Both ''Confessions of a Convert'' (1913) and ''Lourdes'' (1914) were serialized in Notre Dame's ''Ave Maria'' magazine, before appearing as books.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archives.nd.edu/episodes/visitors/rhb/|title=Robert Hugh Benson|website=archives.nd.edu}}</ref>

He was awarded the Dignitary of Honour of the [[Order of the Holy Sepulchre]].

===Novelist===
Benson continued his writing career along with his ministry as a priest. Like both his brothers, [[Edward Frederic Benson]] ("Fred") and [[A. C. Benson|Arthur Christopher Benson]], Robert wrote many [[Ghost story|ghost]] and [[horror fiction|horror]] stories, as well as children's stories and historical fiction. His horror and ghost fiction are collected in ''The Light Invisible'' (1903) and ''A Mirror of Shallott'' (1907).<ref name="ma" /> 

His novel, ''[[Lord of the World]]'' (1907), is generally regarded as one of the first modern [[dystopian]] novels.<ref name="ma" /> In the speculative 2007 he predicted there, the [[Anglican Church]] and other Protestant denominations have crumbled and disappeared under a rising tide of secularism and atheism, leaving an embattled Catholic Church as the sole champion of Christian truth. Nations are armed with weapons which can destroy a whole city from the air within minutes, and [[euthanasia]] is widely practiced and considered as a moral advance. The [[Antichrist]] is depicted as a charismatic liberal who organizes an international body devoted to world peace and order under his direction. 

In his next novel ''The Dawn of All'' (1911), Benson imagined an opposite future 1973 in which the Catholic Church has emerged victorious in England and worldwide after Germany and Austria won the "Emperor War" of 1914; this book is also notable in its fairly accurate prediction of a global network of a passenger air travel.<ref>Maxim Shadurski, "Religion and Science in Robert Hugh Benson's The Dawn of All", article in "English Studies" 94(4), June 2013 - see online abstract 
[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263254362_Religion_and_Science_in_Robert_Hugh_Benson's_The_Dawn_of_All_1911]</ref><ref>The ''volor'' aircraft achieve lift by means of ''aerolite'', an extremely "volatile" gas.</ref>  ''[[Come Rack!

London: A&C Black, 2010 {{ISBN|9780826496973}} (pp. 83-5).</ref> The bibliography below reveals a prodigious output.

Among his historical novels is the Reformation Trilogy: ''By What Authority'' (1905), ''The King’s Achievement'' (1905), and ''The Queen’s Tragedy'' (1907).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.catholicworldreport.com/2015/07/10/the-fiction-of-robert-hugh-benson/|title=The Fiction of Robert Hugh Benson|first=Ann|last=Applegarth|website=www.catholicworldreport.com}}</ref>

===Vatican chaplaincy===
Benson was appointed a [[Chaplain of His Holiness|supernumerary private chamberlain]] to the Pope ([[Pius X]]) in 1911 and consequently styled as [[Monsignor]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Private life==
As a young man, Benson recalled, he had rejected the idea of marriage as "quite inconceivable".<ref>{{cite book|author=Benson, Robert Hugh|title=Confessions of a Convert|url=https://archive.org/details/ConfessionsOfAConvert1913|publisher= Longmans, Green and Co.|year= 1913}}</ref> He had a close friendship with "Baron Corvo", ''alias'' the novelist [[Frederick Rolfe]], with whom he had hoped to write a book on [[Thomas Becket|St Thomas Becket]], until Benson decided that he should not be associated (according to writer Brian Masters)<ref name=Telegraph>{{cite news |first=Christopher |last=Howse |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3637045/Sacred-mysteries.html |title=Sacred mysteries |type=opinion |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=3 February 2007 }}</ref> "with a Venetian pimp and procurer of boys". Nevertheless he maintained his friendship with [[Lord Alfred Douglas]], the friend and lover of [[Oscar Wilde]], and when an acquaintance protested that the connection with Douglas was inappropriate for him, he replied: "Lord Alfred Douglas is my friend, and he'll come down when he likes!"<ref name=Telegraph/>

==Death and legacy==
Benson died of pneumonia in 1914 in Salford, where he had been preaching a mission. He was 42. At his request, he was buried in the orchard of [[Hare Street House]], his house in the Hertfordshire village of Hare Street.<ref>{{cite book |last= Benson |first=A.C. |title= Hugh: Memoirs of a Brother |date=July 2007 |url= http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18615 |publisher=Dodo Press |page=210 |isbn=978-1406548198 }}</ref> A chapel, dedicated to St Hugh, was built over the site. Benson bequeathed the house to the Catholic Church as a county retreat for the [[Archbishop of Westminster]]. The Catholic church in the nearby town of [[Buntingford]], which he helped finance, is dedicated to St Richard of Chichester, but also known as the [[Benson Memorial Church]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://taking-stock.org.uk/search/Benson%20Memorial%20Church/|title=You searched for Benson Memorial Church|website=Taking Stock}}</ref>

In 2019, the house was put up for sale.  Benson's body was exhumed, and moved to the crypt of St. Edmund's College in Old Hall Green.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/Saveharestreethouse/photos/a.231260830836600/428875191075162/|title=Save Hare Street House - Hi All, I apologise for the lack of posts and for the delay in this one, I’ve been moving house and it’s chaotic. Back on 26 Sept I had a second article published in the Hertfordshire Mercury about HSH. This one focuses on past residents. There should also be something in the Buntingford Journal October edition. I hope you enjoy it &#124; Facebook|website=www.facebook.com}}</ref>

The Benson Club is a Catholic reading group named in his honour at [[Fisher House, Cambridge]].
