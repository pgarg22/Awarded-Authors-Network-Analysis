==Early life and education==

Shattuck was educated in the [[Malden, Massachusetts]] public schools. In addition to studying law,<ref name="BeachRines1912" /> she had the advantage of several years of literary training under the supervision of Theodore D. Weld, of [[Boston]]. As an adult, she continued to be a student on various subjects, philosophy and politics being the chief ones of late years.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=647}}

==Career==
Soon after leaving school, she began to write stories for children and articles for the newspapers on different subjects, mainly relating to women. When her father was clerk of the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]], she served as assistant clerk, being the first woman to hold such a position in that State (1871–72).{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=647}}<ref name="BeachRines1912">{{cite book |last1=Beach |first1=Frederick Converse |last2=Rines |first2=George Edwin |title=The Americana: A Universal Reference Library, Comprising the Arts and Sciences, Literature, History, Biography, Geography, Commerce, Etc., of the World |date=1912 |publisher=Scientific American compiling department |pages=44–45 |edition=Public domain |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=35pPAAAAMAAJ&pg=PP45 |access-date=8 November 2021 |language=en}}</ref>

Shattuck served as a clerk in the office of the American Social Science Association in Boston. During the five or six years of the Concord Summer School of Philosophy, she wrote letters for the ''[[Boston Evening Transcript]]'', in which the philosophy of the various great teachers, such as [[Plato]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], was carefully elucidated and made available to the general public. ''The Story of Dante's Divine Comedy'' (New York, 1887) was the outcome of those letters from the Concord school. Her other books, are ''Our Mutual Friend'' (Boston, 1880), a dramatization from [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]] and ''Little Folks East and West'' (Boston, 1891), a book of children's tales.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=647}}

She was interested in all movements for the advancement of women, especially in the cause of woman's political enfranchisement. She made her first speech for suffrage in [[Rochester, New York]], in 1878. Thereafter, she spoke before committees of Congress and of the Massachusetts legislature, and in many conventions in [[Washington, D.C.]] and elsewhere. She was the presiding officer over one of the sessions of the first [[International Council of Women]], held in Washington, D.C., in 1888. She was a quiet speaker and made no attempts at oratory. Her best work was done in writing, rather than in public speaking, unless we include in this term the teaching of politics and of parliamentary law, with the art of presiding and conducting public meetings. Her most popular book was the ''Woman's Manual of Parliamentary Law'' (Boston, 1891), a work that was a recognized standard.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=647}}

==Affiliations==
For ten years, Shattuck served as president of the [[Massachusetts Woman Suffrage Association|National Woman Suffrage Association of Massachusetts]]. She was also president of the Boston Political Class, which she has conducted for seven years, and in which the science of government and the political topics of the day were considered. She was the founder of "The Old and New" of Malden, Massachusetts, one of the oldest woman's clubs in the country.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=647}} She was a member of the [[New England Woman's Press Association]].<ref name="BostonGlobe23mar1937" />

==Personal life==
On June 11, 1878, she married Sidney Doane Shattuck, merchant, of Malden.<ref name="LeonardMarquis1899" />

She died of pneumonia at Malden Hospital, March 24, 1937.{{efn|According to ''The Boston Globe'', Shattuck died March 22, 1937.<ref name="BostonGlobe23mar1937" />}} She was buried at [[Sleepy Hollow Cemetery (Concord, Massachusetts)|Sleepy Hollow Cemetery]], [[Concord, Massachusetts]].<ref name="BostonGlobe23mar1937" />
