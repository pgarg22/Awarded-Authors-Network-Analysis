'''Stephen Phillips''' (28 July 1864 – 9 December 1915) was an [[England|English]] poet and dramatist, who enjoyed considerable popularity early in his career.

==Biography==
He was born at [[Somertown]] near [[Oxford]], the son of the Rev. Stephen Phillips, precentor of Peterborough Cathedral. He was educated at Stratford and Peterborough Grammar Schools, and considered entering [[Queens' College, Cambridge]] on a minor scholarship to study classics; but he instead went to a London [[crammer]] to prepare for the civil service.<ref>J. P. Wearing, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35514 ‘Phillips, Stephen (1864–1915)’], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Jan 2008, accessed 1 June 2009</ref> In 1885, however, he moved to Wolverhampton to join his cousin [[F. R. Benson]]'s dramatic company, and for six years he played various small parts.

In 1890 a slender volume of verse was published at Oxford with the title ''Primavera'', which contained contributions by him and by his cousin [[Laurence Binyon]] and others. In 1894 he published ''Eremus'', a long poem of loose structure in blank verse of a philosophical complexion. In 1896 appeared ''Christ in Hades'', forming with a few other short pieces one of the slim paper-covered volumes of Elkin Mathews's Shilling Garland. This poem caught the eye of the critics, and when it was followed by a collection of ''Poems'' in 1897 the writer's position as a new poet of exceptional gifts was generally recognized. This volume contained a new edition of ''Christ in Hades'', together with ''Marpessa'', ''The Woman with the Dead Soul'', ''The Wife'' and shorter pieces, including ''To Milton, Blind''. The volume won the prize of £100 offered by the [[The Academy (periodical)|''Academy'' newspaper]] for the best new book of its year,<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Stephen Phillips|title=Authors and I|author=Hind, C.

[[George Alexander (actor)|Sir George Alexander]], the actor-manager, moved perhaps by a certain clamour among the critics for a literary drama, then commissioned Phillips to write him a play, the result being ''[[Paolo Malatesta|Paolo]] and [[Francesca da Rimini|Francesca]]'' (1900), a drama founded on [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s famous episode from [[The Divine Comedy|''Inferno'']]. Encouraged by the great success of the drama in its literary form, Mr Alexander produced the piece at the [[St. James's Theatre|St. James' Theatre]] in 1902.<ref>Produced by [[George Alexander (actor)|Sir George Alexander]] at the [[St. James's Theatre|St. James' Theatre]] beginning 6 March 1902. [[#Mason|Mason]], p. 237.</ref> In the meantime, Phillips's next play, ''Herod: a Tragedy'', had been produced by [[Beerbohm Tree]] on 31 October 1900, and was published as a book in 1901; ''Ulysses'', also produced by Beerbohm Tree, was published in 1902; ''The Sin of David'', a drama on the story of David and [[Bathsheba]], translated into the times and terms of [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwellian]] England, was published in 1904; and ''Nero'', produced by Beerbohm Tree, was published in 1906. In these plays the poet's avowed aim was, instead of attempting to revive the method of [[Shakespeare]] and the Elizabethans, to revitalize the method of [[Greek drama]]. ''Paolo and Francesca'' (which admitted certainly one scene on an Elizabethan model) was the most successful.

When a theatrical production of ''Ulysses'' was staged at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]], London, in 1902<ref name="UHMT">{{cite news|url=http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/8th-february-1902/9/-ulysses-at-her-majestys-theatre|title="Ulysses" at Her Majesty's theatre|date=8 February 1902|work=[[The Spectator]]|page=9|accessdate=15 January 2014}}</ref> the opening night was attended by the Royal Family, nobility, politicians, and many other members of high society.<ref name="Tatler">{{cite news|title=Who's Who in a First-night Audience at Her Majesty's|date=29 January 1902|work=[[The Tatler]]|page=216}}</ref> The 29 January 1902 issue of ''[[The Tatler]]'' reported that the artist [[Henry Jamyn Brooks]] was working on a {{convert|9|x|6|ft|m}} picture of the attendees, which was to include some 300 portraits.<ref name="Tatler" />
