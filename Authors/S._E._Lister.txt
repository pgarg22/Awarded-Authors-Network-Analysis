==Reviews==
In May 2014, Lister released her debut novel, ''Hideous Creatures'', through Old Street Publishing.<ref name=Housham/> Jane Housham of ''[[The Guardian]]'' gave the book a positive review, describing it as "a gothic road novel" and saying that its pace was "well-handled throughout".<ref name=Housham/> Author [[Maxim Jakubowski]] also praised the novel, saying that "[it] grips and enchants and you never want it to end". [[Marcus Sedgwick]] commended the book as "what all the best fiction should be; something rich and strange".<ref name="DKW 2"/> In 2015 Lister received a nomination for ''Hideous Creatures'' for that year's Edinburgh First Book Award<ref name="DKW 1"/> – the prize ultimately went to [[Colin MacIntyre]] for ''The Letters of Ivor Punch''.<ref name=Williams/>

Lister's follow-up to ''Hideous Creatures'', ''The Immortals'', appeared in September 2015, again from Old Street.<ref name=Monks/> David Duff of [[We Love This Book]] reviewed described the story as "extraordinary" and the characters as "fascinating". He remarked: "S. E. Lister has done a commendable job of turning a well-trodden concept into something quite new."<ref name=Duff/> Isabella Silvers of ''[[InStyle]]'' recommended the book as one of six to read that summer, saying that she was "gripped" by it.<ref name=Silvers/> Jakubowski again praised Lister, saying that ''The Immortals'' was "truly the stuff of dreams".<ref name="DKW 3"/>

A mixed review came from Rebecca Monks of ''[[The List (magazine)|The List]]'', who awarded the book three points out of five. Monks praised the "fast-paced plot... strong characters and witty, energetic dialogue", and felt that Lister's style was "charming", but criticised the novel's premise as "familiar".<ref name=Monks/> Jane Jakeman of ''[[The Independent]]'' similarly felt that about the book's evocations of "lush", but that "Lister takes us whirling through time so fast that nothing makes any great impression".<ref name=Jakeman/>
