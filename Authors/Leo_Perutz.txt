'''Leopold Perutz''' (2 November 1882, Prague – 25 August 1957, Bad Ischl) was an Austrian [[novelist]] and [[mathematician]]. He was born in [[Prague]] (now capital of the [[Czech Republic]]) and was thus a citizen of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. He lived in [[Vienna]] until the [[Nazism|Nazi]] ''[[Anschluss]]'' in 1938, when he emigrated to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]].

According to the biographical note on the [[Arcade Publishing]] editions of the English translations of his novels, Leo was a mathematician who formulated an [[algebra]]ic [[equation]] which is named after him; he worked as a [[statistician]] for an [[insurance]] company. He was related to the [[biologist]] [[Max Perutz]].<ref>[http://www.nature.com/nsmb/journal/v9/n4/full/nsb0402-245.html Max Ferdinand Perutz OM FRS], obituary by [[Alan R. Fersht]].</ref>

During the 1950s he returned occasionally to Austria, spending the summer and autumn months in the market town of [[St. Wolfgang]] in the [[Salzkammergut]] resort region and in [[Vienna]]. He died in the Austrian spa town of [[Bad Ischl]] in 1957. He wrote his first novel, ''The Third Bullet'', in 1915 while recovering from a wound sustained in the [[First World War]]. In all Perutz wrote eleven novels, which gained the admiration of [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Italo Calvino]], [[Ian Fleming]], [[Karl Edward Wagner]] and [[Graham Greene]]. Wagner cited Perutz' novel ''The Master of the Day of Judgement'' as one of the thirteen best non-supernatural horror novels.<ref>[[N. G. Christakos]], "Three By Thirteen: The Karl Edward Wagner Lists" in ''Black Prometheus: A Critical Study of Karl Edward Wagner'', ed. [[Benjamin Szumskyj]], [[Gothic Press]] 2007.</ref>

== Overview ==
Perutz was born in [[Prague]] to a largely non-religious family of Jewish ancestry.{{sfn|Piper|2013|p=176}} They moved to [[Vienna]], where he attended various schools and colleges before studying [[probability theory]], statistics, actuarial science, and economics.{{sfn|Piper|2013|pp=176&ndash;77}}

Perutz' novels are short and are usually [[historical novels]] combining fast-paced adventure with a [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] twist.
They are influenced by the work of [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]], [[Arthur Schnitzler]] and [[Victor Hugo]] (whose work Perutz
translated into German).<ref>Sorrel Kerbel, ''Jewish writers of the twentieth century'' (p.792-95), Taylor & Francis, 2003
{{ISBN|1-57958-313-X}}</ref> Austrian fellow novelist [[Friedrich Torberg]] once characterized Perutz' literary style as the possible result of a little infidelity of [[Franz Kafka]] and [[Agatha Christie]]. ''The Marquis of Bolibar'' features the [[Wandering Jew]] appearing
during Napoleon's campaign in Spain.<ref name="fr">Franz Rottensteiner, "German Language Fantasy since 1900" in Frank N. Magill,
ed. ''Survey of Modern Fantasy Literature'', Vol 3., (pp. 2391-2414) Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Salem Press, Inc., 1983. {{ISBN|0-89356-450-8}}</ref> ''By Night Under the Stone Bridge'' is an [[Episode|episodic]] work whose separate stories are bound together by the illicit love shared, in their dreams, by a [[Jew]]ish woman and the Emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]]. In the [[Posthumous work|posthumously]]-published ''Leonardo's Judas'', [[Leonardo da Vinci|da Vinci]]'s quest for an appropriate face to give the betrayer in his ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|Last Supper]]'' is interwoven with the squabble between a usurer and the merchant to whom he owes money. The title of his 1933 novel ''Saint Peter's Snow'' (also known in English as ''The Virgin's Brand''), which is set in what was then the present day, refers to a drug which induces religious fervour; the Nazis, understandably, did not care for it. Critic Alan Piper considered it "a psychological detective story", although it has varyingly been categorised as [[science fiction]] or fantasy.{{sfn|Piper|2013|p=176}} Piper believed that the novel was decades ahead of its time due to the description of a hallucinogenic drug derived from an [[ergot]] fungus 10 years before the discovery of [[LSD]].{{sfn|Piper|2013|p=176}} He also thought it astonishing that it discussed the experimental use of this hallucinogen on an isolated village 20 years before the [[1951 Pont-Saint-Esprit mass poisoning]], and proposed that ergot was the psychoactive ingredient used in the ancient mystery cults 40 years before this was put forward as a serious proposal.{{sfn|Piper|2013|p=176}} ''The Master of the Day of Judgement'' is a decidedly different [[mystery fiction|mystery]] story about the circumstances surrounding an actor's death in the early twentieth century, and ''Little Apple'' concerns a [[First World War]] soldier's obsessive quest for revenge.

In his discussion of German language fantastic literature, critic [[Franz Rottensteiner]] describes Perutz as "undoubtedly the finest fantasy author of his time".<ref name="fr" /> Literary scholar Alan Piper described Perutz's work as typically containing "an element of the fantastic, with dramatic plots featuring confusing and conflicting interpretations of events".{{sfn|Piper|2013|p=176}}

In 1933, Perutz published his novel ''St Petri-Schnee'', which would be published in English in 1935 as ''The Virgin's Brand''.{{sfn|Piper|2013|p=176}}
