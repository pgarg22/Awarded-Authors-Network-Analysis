He was one of the [[Astadiggajas]] (a collective title for Telugu poets in the [[noble court|court]]  of [[Krishnadevaraya]] of the [[Vijayanagara Empire]].

==Biography==
 
According to the archeological evidence (Sasanas) available in the Kasanuru village, he was a native of Kasanuru village in Simhadripuram Mandal in [[Kadapa district|Kadapa]] district. He was adopted to the village. He was also believed to be an apprentice of the [[Allasani Peddana]] in his youth. He was later patronised by [[Krishnadevaraya]] and his successors.
His real name was Bhattu Murti, though because he was the [[Gemstone|jewel]] (Bhushanam) of the royal court of [[Aliya Rama Raya]], he later became known as Ramarajabhushanudu. He was also a distinguished musician and played the [[Veena]].

==Works==
His popular works are ''Kavyalankarasangrahamu'', ''Vasucaritramu'', ''Hariscandra Nalopakhyanamu'', and ''Narasabhupaleeyamu''. He dedicated ''Vasucharita'' to [[Tirumala Deva Raya]] and ''Harischandra Nalopakhyanamu'' to Orugnati Narasaraya.
