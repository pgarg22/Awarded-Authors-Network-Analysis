==Writing career==
{{expand section|date=April 2013}}
[[File:Science Fiction Quarterly August 1955.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of ''[[Science Fiction Quarterly]]'' featuring John Jakes' "The Taint"]]
''[[Thrilling Wonder Stories]]'', edited by [[Sam Merwin]], published two 1949–1950 letters from Jakes and two of his stories were published in [[pulp magazines]] edited by [[Howard Browne]] late in 1950, ''The Dreaming Trees'' (''[[Fantastic Adventures]]'', November) and "Your Number is Up!" (''[[Amazing Stories]]'', December). Jakes sold his first short story (a 1,500-word story) in 1950.<ref>https://digitalcommons.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1458&context=cwbr</ref>

[[ISFDB]] catalogs 28 more speculative fiction stories published 1951 to 1953.<ref name=isfdb/> Jakes published dozens of stories and several novels during the twenty years following completion of college, many of them [[fantasy fiction]], science fiction and [[westerns]] and other sorts of [[historical fiction]]. In 1961, Jakes moved to [[Dayton, Ohio]]. He lived there for ten years and worked as a [[copywriter]] for several [[advertising agencies]] while he wrote fiction at night and on the weekends. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.orrt.org/jakes/|title=Ohio Reading Road Trip &#124; John Jakes Biography}}</ref>  In 1971, he began to write full-time.

During this time, he was a member of the [[Swordsmen and Sorcerers' Guild of America]] (SAGA), a loose-knit group of [[heroic fantasy]] authors founded in the 1960s and led by [[Lin Carter]]. The eight original members were self-selected by fantasy credentials alone. They sought to promote the popularity and respectability of the "[[Sword and Sorcery]]" sub genre (such as Brak the Barbarian stories by Jakes).<!-- only source is our SAGA article -->

Jakes gained widespread popularity with the publication of his [[The Kent Family Chronicles|Kent Family Chronicles]], which became a bestselling American Bicentennial Series of books in the mid to late 1970s,<ref name="Youngstown"/> selling 55 million copies. He has since published several more popular works of historical fiction, most dealing with [[American history]], including the North and South trilogy about the [[U.S. Civil War]], which sold 10 million copies and was [[film adaptation|adapted]] as an ABC-TV miniseries.

In September 2013, Jakes was named a Florida Literary Legend at the Florida Heritage Book Festival and Writers Conference in [[St. Augustine, Florida]]. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ticket.heraldtribune.com/2013/09/21/tiptoeing-toward-florida-best-selling-historical-novelist-john-jakes-is-named-a-florida-literary-legend/|title=Tiptoeing toward Florida: Best-selling historical novelist John Jakes is named a Florida Literary Legend}}</ref>
