'''Richard Zimler''' (born 1 January 1956 in [[Roslyn Heights, New York]]) is a best-selling author. His books, which have earned him a 1994 [[National Endowment of the Arts]] Fellowship in Fiction and the 1998 [[Herodotus Award]], have been published in many countries and translated into more than 20 languages.

==Early life==
Zimler graduated from [[Herricks High School]] in suburban New York in 1973.  In 1977, he earned a bachelor's degree in Comparative Religion from [[Duke University]] and five years later obtained a master's degree in Journalism from [[Stanford University]].

==Academic career==
He was a  Professor of Journalism at the [[University of Porto]] and College of Journalism for 16 years.

==Awards==
Richard Zimler received the 2009 Alberto Benveniste literary prize in France for his novel ''Guardian of the Dawn''.  The prize is given to novels that have to do with [[Sephardic]] Jewish culture or history.  It was awarded to him at a ceremony at the [[Sorbonne]] in January 2009.

Five of Zimler's novels - ''Hunting Midnight'' (2005), ''The Search for Sana'' (2007), ''The Seventh Gate'' (2009), ''The Warsaw Anagrams'' (2013) and ''The Night Watchman'' (2016) - have been nominated for the [[International Dublin Literary Award]], the highest value literary prize in the English-speaking world.

His novel ''The Warsaw Anagrams'' was chosen as 2009 Book of the Year by the main Portuguese book magazine ''Ler'' and by the country's high school teachers and students (the 2010 Mariquis de Ouro prize).  It was also chosen as one of the 20 Best Books of the Decade 2000-2009 by the country's foremost daily newspaper, ''Público''.  In August 2011, the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' described the book as follows: "Equal parts riveting, heartbreaking, inspiring and intelligent, this mystery set in the most infamous Jewish ghetto of World War II deserves a place among the most important works of Holocaust literature."

In 2009, Zimler wrote and acted in ''The Slow Mirror,'' a short movie based on one of his stories. Directed by Swedish-Portuguese filmmaker [[Solveig Nordlund]], the short stars Portuguese actors [[Gracinda Nave]] and Marta Peneda. In May 2010, it won the Best Drama award from the New York Downtown Short Film Festival.

''O Cão que Comia a Chuva'', illustrated by one of the most famous and well-respected Portuguese artists [[Julio Pomar]], won the prize for Best Children's Book of 2018 from the Bissaya Barreto Foundation of Portugal.

In July 2017, the city of Porto awarded Zimler its highest distinction, the Medal of Honor. At the ceremony, Porto mayor Rui Moreira described the novelist as "A citizen of Porto who was born far away, who makes Porto greater and grander... Zimler projects the city of Porto out into the world and brings the rest of the world to us."

==The Sephardic Cycle==

Zimler has written five novels that explore the lives of different generations and branches of a Portuguese-Jewish family, the Zarcos. This series, whose works are intended to be read in any order, originated with [[The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon]], which is narrated by a youthful kabbalist named Berekiah Zarco who survives the [[Lisbon Massacre]] of 1506. These works explore such themes as Jewish mysticism; slavery; the devastating effect of the Inquisition on Portugal and its colonies; and the psychological conflict created in people who are forced to hide their faith. The novels are: [[The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon]], set in Sixteenth Century Portugal; ''Hunting Midnight'', which takes place in [[Porto]], London, New York and [[South Carolina]] in the early Nineteenth Century; ''Guardian of the Dawn'', in which the main action takes place in [[Goa]] in the Seventeenth Century; ''The Seventh Gate'', set in Nazi-controlled [[Berlin]] in the 1930s; and ''The Incandescent Threads'', set mainly in New York and [[Montreal]] from 1970 to the present time but also with two long chapters that take place in Poland during and right after the Second World War. ''The Incandescent Threads'' has yet to be published in English, though the Portuguese edition was published in 2018. Two of the novels in the Sephardic Cycle have been nominated for the [[International Dublin Literary Award]]: ''Hunting Midnight'' and ''The Seventh Gate''. All five books were Number 1 bestsellers in Portugal.

==Other works==
Zimler has also edited an anthology of short stories for which all the author's royalties go to [[Save the Children]], the largest children's rights organization in the world.  The anthology is entitled ''The Children's Hours''.  Participating authors include  
[[Margaret Atwood]], [[Nadine Gordimer]], [[André Brink]], [[Markus Zusak]], [[David Almond]], [[Katherine Vaz]], [[Alberto Manguel]], [[Eva Hoffman]], [[Junot Díaz]], [[Uri Orlev]] and [[Ali Smith]].

In August 2011, Zimler published his first book of poetry: ''Love's Voice: 72 Kabbalistic Haiku''. The verses in the book express Jewish mystical ideas and imagery in the form of [[haiku]].

Zimler has written five children's books that have been published in Portuguese: ''Maria e Danilo e o Mágico Perdido'', ''Dança Quando Chegares ao Fim'', ''Hugo e Eu e as Mangas de Marte'', ''Se Eu Fosse'' and ''O Cão que Comia a Chuva''.

In December 2018, Portuguese singer-songwriter [[Pedro Abrunhosa]] released a new album featuring a duet with American singer-songwriter [[Lucinda Williams]] for which Zimler wrote the English version of the lyrics. The song is entitled ''Hold Me''.
