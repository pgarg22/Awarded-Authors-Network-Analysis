Known for his liberal values and challenging the established order, he wrote over 100,000 couplets and more than 1,000 [[Rubāʿiyāt|rubaiyat]] in his lifetime. His wrote ''Yaadon ki Barat'', his autobiography which is noted for its frank and candid style. The first Prime Minister of India, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] held him in high esteem and frequently attended the mushaira at Lala Kishan Lal Kalra's United Coffee House where Josh performed.<ref name=AsianVoice>{{cite news|url=https://www.asian-voice.com/News/India/Josh-Malihabadi%E2%80%99s-defection-to-Pakistan |newspaper=Asian Voice (weekly newspaper)|author=Hari Desai|title=Josh Malihabadi's defection to Pakistan |date=13 February 2017|access-date=18 January 2021}}</ref><ref name=Dawn/><ref name=TheNation2>{{cite news|url=https://nation.com.pk/22-Feb-2017/remembering-the-revolutionary-poet-josh-malihabadi|author=Iftikhar Alam|title=Remembering the revolutionary poet Josh Malihabadi|newspaper=The Nation (newspaper)|date=22 February 2017|access-date=18 January 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/josh-in-old-delhi/article28371814.ece | location=Chennai, India |newspaper=The Hindu (newspaper) | title=Josh in Old Delhi... | date=27 May 2002 |accessdate=18 January 2021}}</ref> 

He was an Indian citizen until 1956, when he emigrated to [[Pakistan]] and became a Pakistani citizen. Some of his works were translated  to English like ''The Unity of Mankind'' elegies by Josh Malihabadi by Syed Akbar Pasha Tirmizi who was a [[Pakistani]] citizen and a high court [[advocate]].

==Early life==
Josh was born to an Urdu-speaking Muslim family of [[Afridi Pashtun|Afridi]] Pathan origin in [[Malihabad]] (13 miles from Lucknow), [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]], British India.<ref name=AsianVoice/> He received early education in Arabic, Persian, Urdu and English at his home.<ref name=TheNation2/><ref name=TheHindu>{{cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/the-life-and-times-of-josh/article28547832.ece|title=The life and times of Josh Malihabadi|author=Diwan Singh Bajeli|newspaper=The Hindu (newspaper)|date=18 July 2019|access-date=18 January 2021}}</ref> He studied at St Peter's College, [[Agra]] and passed his [[Senior Cambridge]] examination in 1914. Subsequently, he studied [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] and, in 1918, spent six months at [[Rabindranath Tagore|Tagore's]] [[Visva-Bharati University|university]] at [[Shantiniketan]]. The death of his father, Bashir Ahmed Khan, in 1916, prevented him from undertaking a college education.

His family had a long tradition of producing men of letters. Indeed, his great-grandfather, Nawab Faqeer Muhammad Khan'Goya', grandfather Nawab Muhammad Ahmad Khan, paternal uncle Ameer Ahmad Khan and father Basheer Ahmad Khan were all poets with numerous works (poetry collections, translations, and essays) to their name.<ref>[http://malihabad.blogspot.com/2008/05/malihabad-oasis-of-poets.html "Malihabad: An Oasis of Poets"] by Dr. Navras Jaat Aafreedi, ''Azad Academy Journal'', XIX, 3</ref>
Another of his relative was the journalist, scholar and [[Abul Kalam Azad]]'s confident, [[Abdur Razzaq Malihabadi]].<ref>Ghulam Akbar, ''He was not hanged'', Midas (1989), p. 109</ref><ref name=TheNation2/>

==Career==
In 1925, Josh started to supervise translation work at [[Osmania University]] in the princely state of [[Hyderabad state|Hyderabad]]. However, his stay there ended when he found himself exiled for writing a ''[[nazm]]'' against the [[Nizam of Hyderabad]], the then ruler of the state.<ref name=AllPoetry/>

Soon thereafter, he founded the magazine ''Kaleem'' (literally, "speaker" in Urdu), in which he wrote articles in favour of independence from the [[British Raj]] in India. His poem Hussain aur Inquilab (Hussain and Revolution) won him the title of ''Shaair-e-Inquilaab'' (Poet of the Revolution).  Subsequently, he became more actively involved in the freedom struggle (albeit, in an intellectual capacity) and became close to some of the political leaders of that era, especially [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] (later to be the first Prime Minister of independent India).<ref name=AsianVoice/><ref name=AllPoetry/> 

After the end of the British Raj in India in 1947, Josh became the editor of the publication ''Aaj-Kal''.<ref name=AllPoetry>[https://allpoetry.com/Josh-Malihabadi Biography of Josh Malihabadi on allpoetry.com website] Retrieved 19 January 2021</ref>

==Josh in Pakistan==


Josh migrated to Pakistan in 1956 - despite Jawaharlal Nehru's insistence against it - over what is generally believed to be his concern regarding the future of Josh and [[Urdu language|Urdu]] language in [[India]],<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mag/2002/10/06/stories/2002100600210400.htm | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030630232658/http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mag/2002/10/06/stories/2002100600210400.htm | url-status=dead | archive-date=30 June 2003 | location=Chennai, India | newspaper=[[The Hindu]] | title=Partition's unresolved business | date=18 January 2021}}</ref><ref name=TheHindu/> where he thought the [[Hindu]] majority would encourage the use of [[Hindi]] rather than [[Urdu language|Urdu]]. After migration, Josh settled in [[Karachi]] and worked for [[Anjuman-i-Tarraqi-i-Urdu]].<ref name=TFL>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Josh+Malihabadi+remembered+on+his+31st+death+anniversary.-a0320041947 Josh Malihabadi remembered on his 31st death anniversary] The Free Library website, Retrieved 19 January 2021</ref><ref name=AllPoetry/>

==Death and legacy==
Josh remained in Pakistan until he died on 22 February 1982 in [[Islamabad]].<ref name=TheNation2/> [[Faiz Ahmad Faiz|Mustafa Zaidi, Faiz Ahmad Faiz]] and Syed Fakhruddin Balley were the closest companions and friends of Josh and Sajjad Hyder Kharosh (son of Josh).<ref name=Dawn/> [[Faiz Ahmad Faiz]] visited [[Islamabad]] during his illness and Syed Fakhruddin Balley remained entirely engaged with Josh and Sajjad Hyder Kharosh.<ref name=Dawn>[https://www.dawn.com/news/607275/biography-josh-the-man-the-vision Biography of Josh Malihabadi on Dawn (newspaper)] Published 19 February 2011, Retrieved 18 January 2021</ref> Renowned poet Faiz, who coincidentally landed in Pakistan on February 22, 1982 after a long self-imposed exile to meet [[General Zia Ul-Haq]], the then military ruler of Pakistan, and complained to him for not attending Josh’s funeral, and after listening to Zia’s lame-duck excuse, he retorted, 'No Bigger person will be buried in this land ever again.'<ref name=Dawn/>

Professor Ehtesham Hussain was the first eminent figure who started working on Josh’s Biography, with his implied consent. He was in the early stages of his work, when suddenly Josh migrated to Pakistan. It's evident that the scholar Ehtesham lost his passion and never completed the work. Professor Mohammad Hassan, a prominent scholar of Ehtesham’s lineage, then wrote a nearly 100 page epilogue on Josh in 1987, that will soon be published by JLSC, Calgary. [[Hilal Naqvi]], eminent poet and researcher almost devoted his entire life in gathering and publishing Josh’s work. The list of Josh’s admirers are so long and over a span of nearly 100 years, but the most prominent contributors and writers amongst them include, professor Ehtesham Hussain, [[Rais Amrohvi]], [[Mustafa Zaidi]], Sehba Luckhnavi, Professor Qamar Raes, Ali Sardar, Professor Mumtaz Hussain, Ali Ahmed Fatmi,  Shahid Mahuli of Ghalib Institute, Delhi, India, Professor [[Sahar Ansari]], Rahat  Saeed,  [[Jaun Elia]], [[Muhammad Ali Siddiqui]], Professor Hasan Abid, Jaffar Ahmed, [[Parvin  Shakir]], [[Iqbal Haider]], Shaista Rizvi.<ref name=TFL/><ref name=Dawn/>

Moreover, Josh’s maternal grandson Farrukh Jamal Malihabadi, Josh Malihabadi's granddaughter [[Tabassum Akhlaq]] has also carried over the legacy of his poetry. Presently, famous artist Fahim Hamid Ali is working on a unique and contemporary presentation of Josh.<ref name=Dawn/>

Josh Literary Society of Canada (JLSC) was formed by Iqbal Haider, Arshad Vasti, Shaista Rizvi, Naheed Kazmi,  Nighat Haider, Hasan Zaheer, Dr. Aqeel Athar, Alim Ghaznvi , Abdul Qavi Zia and others in February 1983 in Calgary, Canada.

JLSC convened its first literary conference in Calgary in February 1986 under the title of '''Josh - The Poet of the Century''', with a keynote article by the eminent scholar Professor Mumtaz Hussain.

Then Josh Society and Irteqa Foundation of Karachi together commemorated Josh Centennial a 3-day, mega literary event  in Karachi, followed up by other one day programs in Delhi, Allahabad, Lucknow, Lahore, Hyderabad and Dubai. Josh Literary Society has published and reprinted 14 books on Josh. JLSC has also convened and celebrated many other Centennials or seminars like [[Firaq Gorakhpuri]], [[Majaz Lucknawi]], [[Mustafa Zaidi]], [[Juan Elia]], [[Saadat Hasan Manto]], Rashid, [[Faiz Ahmed Faiz]] and [[Ismat Chughtai]].<ref name=TFL/>

The '''Josh Memorial Committee''' was formed in 1986 by Tabassum Akhlaq and she is the current chairperson. The committee organises seminars on Josh Malihabadi's personality, history and literary work. These seminars are usually held on his birthday and death anniversary (on 5 December and 22 February respectively).<ref>[https://www.dawn.com/news/1088874 Tributes paid to Josh Malihabadi] Dawn (newspaper), Published 23 Feb 2014, Retrieved 18 January 2021</ref>

In August 2012, the [[Government of Pakistan]] announced [[Hilal-i-Imtiaz]] for Josh Malihabadi. This award was presented to his granddaughter and founding chairperson of Josh Memorial Committee, Tabassum Akhlaq by the [[President of Pakistan]], [[Asif Ali Zardari]] in a ceremony held in the [[Presidency]] on [[Pakistan Day]] 23 March 2013.<ref name=TheNation/>

The lifelong mission of Josh can be summed up in his own words:

  {{cquote|Kaam hai mera taghayyur, Naam hai mera shabaab<br />
Mera naara: inquilab-o-inquilab-o-inquilab}}

  {{cquote|My task is change, my name is youth!<br />
My slogan: revolution, revolution and revolution!}}<ref name=AsianVoice/>

A noted scholar and literary critic of Pakistan [[Pervez Hoodbhoy]] is quoted as saying about his poetry, "Poetry flowed from Josh's pen like water from a bubbling spring."<ref name=TheNation2/>
