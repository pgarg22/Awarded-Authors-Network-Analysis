'''Thomas Ernest Hulme''' ({{IPAc-en|h|j|uː|m}}; 16 September 1883 &ndash; 28 September 1917) was an English critic and poet who, through his writings on art, literature and politics, had a notable influence upon [[modernism]].<ref>"Though Ezra Pound coined the word "Imagist" and served as chief publicist for the movement, it was the theories supplied by T. E. Hulme which gave the early Imagist experiments their 'authority and direction.' Both men served their common purpose well; together they called the tune for one of the most lively phases of the prewar poetic renascence. With Hulme as metaphysician and Pound as impresario, the Imagists 'did a lot of useful pioneering work. They dealt a blow at the post-Victorian magazine poets... They livened things up a lot. They made free verse popular... And they tried to attain an exacting if narrow standard of style in poetry.' Indirectly they did more. The Imagists, above all other prewar coteries, put into the hands of the poets of the twenties the technical charts and compasses by which to find their poetic way across the hard dry sands of the Wasteland." — Ross, Robert H. (1968). [https://archive.org/stream/backgroundstomod00perrrich#page/38/mode/2up "Sound and Fury."] In: ''Backgrounds to Modern Literature''. San Francisco: Chandler Publishing Company, p. 58.</ref> He was an aesthetic philosopher and the 'father of imagism'.<ref>Hughes, Glenn, 'Imagism & Imagism', Stanford University Press 1931</ref>

==Early life==

Hulme was born at Gratton Hall, [[Endon]], [[Staffordshire]], the son of Thomas and Mary Hulme.  He was educated at [[Newcastle-under-Lyme]] High School and, from 1902, [[St John's College, Cambridge]], where he read mathematics, but was sent down in 1904 after rowdy behaviour on [[Boat Race]] night.<ref>"In 1902, Hulme won a mathematics exhibition to St. John’s College, Cambridge. A teetotaler himself, Hulme apparently consorted with some who were not. He was at any rate sent down in 1904 for what Herbert Read delicately called "indulging in a brawl". (A college document that might have slipped out of Bertie Wooster’s dossier mentions "over-stepping the limits of the traditional license allowed by the authorities on Boat Race night.")" — Kimball, Roger (1997). [http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/importanceoftehulme-kimball-3385 "The Importance of T. E. Hulme,"] ''The New Criterion'', Vol. XV, p. 18.</ref> He was thrown out of Cambridge a second time after a scandal involving a [[Roedean School|Roedean]] girl. He returned to his studies at [[University College London]], before travelling around [[Canada]] and spending time in [[Brussels]] acquiring languages.

From about 1907 Hulme became interested in [[philosophy]],<ref>Mead, Henry (2008). "T. E. Hulme, Bergson, and The New Philosophy," ''European Journal of English Studies'', Vol. XII, No. 3, pp. 245–260.</ref> translating works by [[Henri Bergson]]<ref>Gibson, Matthew (2011). "Contradictory Images: The Conflicting Influences of Henri Bergson and William James on T. E. Hulme, and the Consequences for Imagism," ''Review of English Studies'' 62, pp. 275–295.</ref> and sitting in on lectures at Cambridge. He translated [[Georges Sorel]]'s ''Reflections on Violence''. The most important influences on his thought were Bergson, who asserted that 'human experience is relative, but religious and ethical values are absolute'<ref>Pratt, William (1985). Introduction to ''The Influence of French Symbolism on Modern American Poetry,'' by Rene Taupin. New York: AMS Press Inc. {{ISBN|0-404-61579-1}}</ref> and, later, [[Wilhelm Worringer]] (1881–1965), German art historian and critic – in particular his ''Abstraktion und Einfühlung'' (''Abstraction and Empathy'', 1908).<ref>Jones, Alun R. (1960). "T. E. Hulme, Wilhelm Worringer and the Urge to Abstraction", ''British Journal of Aesthetics'', Vol. I, pp. 1–6.</ref> Hulme was influenced by [[Remy de Gourmont]]'s aristocratic concept of art and his studies of sensibility and style.<ref>Burne, Glen S. (1963). ''Remy de Gourmont: His Ideas & Influence in England & America''. Southern Illinois University Press.</ref> From 1909 Hulme contributed critical articles to ''[[The New Age]]'', edited by [[A. R. Orage]].
 
Hulme developed an interest in poetry<ref>"It was probably the contrast between the sensory image and a traditional diction that first suggested to T. E. Hulme the isolation of the image. If the image could be identified as the only poetic force within a poem, why not proceed to identify poem and image, as had been the common practice in China or Japan? To cut the cackle – that was to be the first aim of a modern poetry." — Read, Herbert (1955). "The Drift of Modern Poetry," ''Encounter'', Vol. IV, No. 1, p. 6.</ref> and wrote a small number of poems. He was made secretary of the [[Poets' Club]], attended by such establishment figures as [[Edmund Gosse]] and [[Henry Newbolt]]. There he encountered [[Ezra Pound]] and [[F. S. Flint]].<ref>Isaacs, Jacob (1952). [https://archive.org/stream/backgroundofmode00isaarich#page/34/mode/2up "The Coming of the Image,"] in ''The Background of Modern Poetry''. New York: E. P. Dutton & Co., Inc., pp. 34–51.</ref> In late 1908 Hulme delivered his paper ''[[A Lecture on Modern Poetry]]'' to the club. Hulme's poems "Autumn" and "A City Sunset", both published in 1909 in a Poets' Club anthology,<ref>''For Christmas MDCCCCVIII'' (London: The Poets' Club), 1909.</ref> have the distinction of being the first [[Imagist]] poems.<ref>Schmidt, Michael (1998). ''Lives of the Poets''. London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson {{ISBN|978-0-297-84014-5}} 
</ref> A further five poems were published in ''The New Age'' in 1912 as ''The Complete Poetical Works of T. E. Hulme''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hulme|first=T.

E. Hulme]'' (1915). London: Elkin Mathew, pp. 58–64</ref> Despite this misleading title, Hulme in fact wrote about 25 poems totalling some 260 lines, of which the majority were possibly written between 1908 and 1910.<ref>{{cite book

In his critical writings Hulme distinguished between [[Romanticism]],<ref>Krieger, Murray (1953). "The Ambiguous Anti-Romanticism of T. E. Hulme," ''ELH'', Vol. 20, No. 4, pp. 300–314.</ref> a style informed by a belief in the infinite in man and nature, characterised by Hulme as "spilt religion", and [[Classicism]], a mode of art stressing human finitude, formal restraint, concrete imagery and, in Hulme's words, "dry hardness".<ref>Hulme, T. E. (2003). "Romanticism and Classicism." In: ''Selected Writings.'' Ed. Patrick McGuinness. New York: Routledge, pp. 68–83.</ref><ref>Hadjiyiannis, Christos (2013). "Romanticism versus Classicism in 1910: T. E. Hulme, Edward Storer and The Commentator," ''Literature and History'', Vol. XXII, No. 1, pp. 25–41.</ref> Similar views were later expressed by [[T. S. Eliot]].<ref>"The English critic and philosopher T. E. Hulme had written, in the years immediately preceding his death in World War I in 1917, a series of essays in which he attacked the subjectivism and vagueness of romantic literature and advocated "dry and hard" images in poetry as well as objectivity and discipline in art in general. Hulme believed that "man is by nature bad or limited, and can consequently only accomplish anything of value by disciplines, ethical, heroic or political", and he saw one consequence of this belief as an abandonment of romantic optimism about the nature and potentialities of man. Hulme's views influenced T. S. Eliot and are reflected in Eliot's influential essay, ''Tradition and the Individual Talent'', which first appeared in 1917." — Daiches, David (1962). [https://archive.org/stream/timeofharvestam00spil#page/94/mode/2up "The New Criticism."] In: ''Time of Harvest, American Literature, 1910–1960''. New York: Hill and Wang, p. 96.</ref> Hulme's ideas had a major effect on [[Wyndham Lewis]] (quite literally when they came to blows over [[Kate Lechmere]]; Lewis ended the worse for it, hung upside down by the cuffs of his trousers from the railings of Great Ormond Street).<ref>McGuinness, Patrick (1998), Ed. ''T. E. Hulme: Selected Writings''. Manchester: Fyfield Books, p. xvi.</ref> He championed the art of [[Jacob Epstein]] and [[David Bomberg]], was a friend of [[Gaudier-Brzeska]], and was in on the debut of Lewis's [[literary magazine]] ''[[BLAST (magazine)|BLAST]]'' and [[vorticism]].

Hulme's politics were conservative, and he moved further to the right after 1911 as a result of contact with [[Pierre Lasserre]], who was associated with ''[[Action Française]]''.

==First World War==

[[File:Hulme 1.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Lieut. T. E. Hulme in uniform]]

Hulme volunteered as an artilleryman in 1914 and served with the [[Honourable Artillery Company]] and later the [[Royal Marine Artillery]] in France and Belgium. He kept up his writing for ''The New Age''. Notable publications during this period for that magazine were "War Notes", written under the pen name "North Staffs", and "A Notebook", which contains some of his most organised critical writing. He was wounded in 1916. Back at the front in 1917, he was killed by a shell at [[Oostduinkerke]] near [[Nieuwpoort, Belgium|Nieuwpoort]], in [[West Flanders]].

<blockquote>[...] On 28 September 1917, four days after his thirty-fourth birthday, Hulme suffered a direct hit from a large shell which literally blew him to pieces. Apparently absorbed in some thought of his own he had failed to hear it coming and remained standing while those around threw themselves flat on the ground. What was left of him was buried in the Military Cemetery at Koksijde, West-Vlaanderen, in Belgium where—no doubt for want of space—he is described simply as 'One of the War poets'."<ref>Ferguson, Robert (2002). ''The Short Sharp Life of T. E. Hulme''. London: Allen Lane, p. 270.</ref></blockquote>
