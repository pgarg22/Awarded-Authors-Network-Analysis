==Biography==
Cui Hao was born in Biànzhōu (汴州, present day [[Kaifeng]], [[Henan]]) and passed the [[Keju|imperial examinations]] in 723. He is known to have traveled extensively as an official, particularly between the years 723–744. He was known for three poetry topic - women, frontier outposts, and natural scenery. His life was initially conventional; along with [[Wang Wei (Tang dynasty)|Wang Wei]], he was one of the perfectors of the ''[[Shi (poetry)#Jintishi|jintishi]]''  form. Later, however, he acquired a reputation for disreputable personal behaviour and passed through several marriages. His later verse is similarly unconstrained.

==Poems==
Fifteen poems exist on the topic of women and fifteen poems exist on the latter two topics.<ref name="Wan2">Wan: 2 - 3. Thirty nine poems are contained in Wan's book</ref> A famous poem of his is the [[Yellow Crane Tower]]; which is one of the four of his poems included in the [[Three Hundred Tang Poems]] anthology, written in seven-character-per-line [[regulated verse]], and which was later translated into English by [[Witter Bynner]] as "''THE YELLOW CRANE TERRACE''". Also included in the ''Tang 300'' is a seven-character-per-line regular verse form poem written in the ''[[Huaigu (poetry)|huaigu]]'' genre style on his passage through [[Huayin]], north of [[Mount Hua|Hua Shan]], as well as two [[Gushi (poetry)|old or folk style]] pieces with erotic overtones.
