In April 2010, an article by Rowling was published in ''[[The Times]]'', in which she criticised
then Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron's plan to encourage married couples to stay together by offering them a £150 annual tax credit: "Nobody who has ever experienced the reality of poverty could say 'it's not the money, it's the message'. When your flat has been broken into, and you cannot afford a locksmith, it is the money. When you are two pence short of a tin of baked beans, and your child is hungry, it is the money.

==Legal disputes==
{{Main|Legal disputes over the Harry Potter series}}
Rowling, her publishers, and [[Time Warner]], the owner of the rights to the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' films]], have taken numerous legal actions to protect their copyright. The worldwide popularity of the ''Harry Potter'' series has led to the appearance of a number of locally produced, unauthorised sequels and other derivative works, sparking efforts to ban or contain them.<ref name=yemets><span class="plainlinks">[http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/mpapps/pagetools/print/news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/2846105.stm "Rowling seeks 'Grotter' ban"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181106192110/http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/mpapps/pagetools/print/news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/2846105.stm |date=6 November 2018 }}.
