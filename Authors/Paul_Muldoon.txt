'''Paul Muldoon''' (born 20 June 1951) is an Irish poet. He has published more than thirty collections and won a [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]] and the [[T. S. Eliot Prize]]. At [[Princeton University]] he is currently both the Howard G. B. Clark '21 University Professor in the Humanities and Founding Chair of the Lewis Center for the Arts.<ref>[http://giving.princeton.edu/giftplanning/legacies/anniversary.xml Princeton University bequests.]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.princeton.edu/pr/catalog/ua/08/CWR/|title=Princeton University listing|access-date=15 September 2019}}</ref> He held the post of [[Oxford Professor of Poetry]] from 1999 to 2004 and has also served as president of the [[Poetry Society]] (UK)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.poetrysociety.org.uk/content/aboutus/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504140414/http://www.poetrysociety.org.uk/content/aboutus|url-status=dead|title=Poetry Society.|archive-date=4 May 2009|access-date=15 September 2019}}</ref> and Poetry Editor at ''[[The New Yorker]]''.

==Life and work==
Muldoon was born, the eldest of three children, on a farm in [[County Armagh]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.paulmuldoon.net/biography/|title=Biography|access-date=15 September 2019}}</ref> outside [[The Moy]], near the boundary with [[County Tyrone]], Northern Ireland.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/19/magazine/19muldoon.html?pagewanted=4 ''The New York Times'' profile "Word Freak"], 19 November 2006.</ref> His father worked as a farmer (among other jobs) and his mother was a school-mistress. In 2001, Muldoon said of the Moy: <blockquote>It's a beautiful part of the world. It's still the place that's 'burned into the retina', and although I haven't been back there since I left for university 30 years ago, it's the place I consider to be my home. We were a fairly non-political household; my parents were nationalists, of course, but it was not something, as I recall, that was a major area of discussion. But there were patrols; an army presence; movements of troops; a sectarian divide. And that particular area was a nationalist enclave, while next door was the parish where the [[Orange Order]] was founded; we'd hear the drums on summer evenings. But I think my mother, in particular, may have tried to shelter us from it all. Besides, we didn't really socialise a great deal. We were 'blow-ins' – arrivistes – new to the area, and didn't have a lot of connections.<ref name="Play">[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/may/12/poetry.artsandhumanities ''The Guardian'' Profile ''The poet at play''], 12 May 2001. Retrieved 27 February 2010.</ref></blockquote> Talking of his home life, he continues: "I'm astonished to think that, apart from some [[Catholic Truth Society]] pamphlets, some books on saints, there were, essentially, no books in the house, except one set, the Junior World Encyclopaedia, which I certainly read again and again. People would say, I suppose, that it might account for my interest in a wide range of arcane bits of information. At some level, I was self-educated." He was a '"Troubles poet" from the beginning.<ref name="Play" />

In 1969, Muldoon read English at [[Queen's University Belfast]], where he met [[Seamus Heaney]] and became close to [[the Belfast Group]] of poets which included [[Michael Longley]], [[Ciarán Carson]], [[Medbh McGuckian]] and [[Frank Ormsby]]. Muldoon said of the experience, "I think it was fairly significant, certainly to me. It was exciting. But then I was 19, 20 years old, and at university, so everything was exciting, really." Muldoon was not a strong student at Queen's. He recalls: "I had stopped. Really, I should have dropped out. I'd basically lost interest halfway through. Not because there weren't great people teaching me, but I'd stopped going to lectures, and rather than doing the decent thing, I just hung around".<ref name="Play" /> During his time at Queens, his first collection ''New Weather'' was published by [[Faber and Faber]]. He met his first wife, fellow student Anne-Marie Conway, and they were married after their graduation in 1973. Their marriage broke up in 1977.

For thirteen years (1973–86), Muldoon worked as an arts producer for the [[BBC]] in [[Belfast]]. In this time, which saw the most bitter period of [[the Troubles]], he published the collections ''Why Brownlee Left'' (1980) and ''Quoof'' (1983). After leaving the BBC, he taught English and Creative Writing at the [[University of East Anglia]] and at [[Caius College]] and [[Fitzwilliam College]], [[Cambridge]],<ref name="Play"/><ref name="Cambridge">[http://www.cantab.org/events/upcoming-events/event/2002 Cambridge in America: Poetry, Conversation & Irish Whiskey], 8 October 2013. Retrieved 21 September 2013.</ref> where his students included [[Lee Hall (playwright)|Lee Hall]] (''[[Billy Elliot]]'') and [[Giles Foden]] (''[[Last King of Scotland]]''). In 1987, Muldoon emigrated to the United States, where he has taught on the creative writing program at [[Princeton University|Princeton]]. He was [[Professor of Poetry]] at [[Oxford University]] for the five-year term 1999–2004, and is an Honorary Fellow of [[Hertford College, Oxford]].<ref name="Play" />

Muldoon is married to novelist [[Jean Hanff Korelitz]], whom he met at an [[Arvon Foundation|Arvon]] writing course. He has two children, Dorothy and Asher, and lives primarily in [[New York City]].<ref name="Play" /><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/22/realestate/the-poetry-of-downsizing.html?pagewanted=all "The Poetry of Downsizing"]. ''[[The New York Times]]'', 22 December 2013. Accessed 12 October 2014.</ref>

==Poetry and other works==
His poetry is known for his difficult, sly, allusive style, casual use of obscure or archaic words, understated wit, [[pun]]ning, and deft technique in meter and [[half rhyme|slant rhyme]].<ref>{{cite book| last=Wills| first=Clair| title=Reading Paul Muldoon| location=Newcastle Upon Tyne| publisher=Bloodaxe Books| year=1998| pages=9| isbn=1-85224-348-1}}</ref> As Peter Davidson says in ''[[The New York Times]]'' review of books "Muldoon takes some honest-to-God reading. He's a riddler, enigmatic, distrustful of appearances, generous in allusion, doubtless a dab hand at crossword puzzles".<ref Name="Darkness">[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/13/books/darkness-at-muldoon.html?pagewanted=1 "Darkness at Muldoon"], ''The New York Times'' review, 13 October 2002. Accessed 27 February 2010.</ref>  ''[[The Guardian]]'' cites him as being "among the few significant poets of our half-century"; "the most significant English-language poet born since the second world war" – a talent off the map.<ref name="Play" /> (Notably, [[Seamus Heaney]] was born in 1939.) Muldoon's work is often compared with Heaney, a fellow Northern Irish poet, friend and mentor to Muldoon. Heaney, who won the 1995 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], is slightly better known, sells widely and has enjoyed more popular success.

In 2003, Muldoon won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]]. He has been awarded fellowships in the [[Royal Society of Literature]] and the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]; the 1994 [[T. S. Eliot]] Prize; the 1997 [[Irish Times]] Poetry Prize, and the 2003 [[Griffin Poetry Prize|Griffin International Prize for Excellence in Poetry]]. He was also shortlisted for the 2007 [[Poetry Now Award]]. Muldoon's poems have been collected into four books: ''Selected Poems 1968–1986'' (1986), ''New Selected Poems: 1968–1994'' (1996), ''Poems 1968–1998'' (2001) and ''Selected Poems 1968–2014'' (2016). In September 2007, he was hired as poetry editor of ''[[The New Yorker]]''.

Most of Muldoon's collections contain shorter poems with an inclusion of a long concluding poem. As Muldoon produced more collections, the long poems gradually took up more space in the volume, until in 1990 the poem ''Madoc: A Mystery'' took over the volume of that name, leaving only seven short poems to appear before it. Muldoon has not since published a poem of comparable length, but a new trend is emerging whereby more than one long poem appears in a volume.

''Madoc: A Mystery'', exploring themes of colonisation, is among Muldoon's most difficult works. It includes, as "poetry", such non-literary constructions as maps and geometric diagrams. In the book ''Irish Poetry since 1950'', John Goodby states it is "by common consent, the most complex poem in modern Irish literature [...]  – a massively ambitious, a historiographical [[metafiction]]".<ref>For an extended discussion of the poem see: Goodby, John (2000), ''Irish poetry since 1950: from stillness into history'' Manchester University Press, p. 296.</ref> The post-modern poem narrates, in 233 sections (the same number as the number of Native American tribes), an alternative history in which [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] and [[Robert Southey]] come to America to found a [[utopian]] community. The two poets had, in reality, discussed but never undertaken this journey. Muldoon's poem is inspired by Southey's work ''[[Madoc (poem)|Madoc]]'', about a legendary Welsh prince of [[Madoc|that name]].  Critics are divided over the poem's success. Some are stunned by its scope<ref name="Play" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/paul-muldoon|title=Paul Muldoon|date=14 September 2019|website=Poetry Foundation|access-date=15 September 2019}}</ref> and many others, such as [[John Banville]], have professed themselves utterly baffled by it – feeling it to be wilfully obscure.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.complete-review.com/reviews/muldoonp/madoc.htm|title=Madoc by Paul Muldoon |access-date=27 May 2009 |publisher=completereview.org |quote= I cannot help feeling that this time (Muldoon) has gone too far – so far, at least, that I can hardly make him out at all, off there in the distance, dancing by himself.}}</ref> Muldoon says of it: "I quite enjoy having fun. It's part of how it is, and who we are."<ref name="Play" />

Muldoon has contributed the librettos for four operas by  [[Daron Hagen]]: ''[[Shining Brow]]'' (1992), ''[[Vera of Las Vegas]]'' (1996), ''[[Bandanna (opera)|Bandanna]]'' (1998), and ''[[The Antient Concert]]'' (2005). His interests have not only included libretto, but the rock lyric as well, penning lines for the band [[The Handsome Family]] as well as [[Warren Zevon]] whose title track "My Ride's Here" belongs to a Muldoon collaboration. Muldoon also writes lyrics for (and plays "rudimentary" rhythm guitar in) his own Princeton-based rock bands. [[RACKETT (band)|Rackett]] (2004–2010)<ref>Val Nolan, 'Lets go make some noise!', ''[[The Stinging Fly]]'', Volume 2, Issue 8 (Dublin: Winter 2007/08), pp. 11–13; Feature on Paul Muldoon’s band Rackett, specifically their concert at the Róisín Dubh, Galway, during their 2007 Irish tour.</ref> was disbanded in 2010. Another of Muldoon's bands, Wayside Shrines,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://waysideshrines.org/|title=Waysideshrines.org|website=waysideshrines.org|access-date=15 September 2019}}</ref> has recorded and released thirteen of the lyrics included in Muldoon's collection of rock lyrics, ''Word on the Street''. His current group is known as Rogue Oliphant.

Muldoon has also edited a number of anthologies, written two children's books, translated the work of other authors, performed live at the [[The Poetry Society of New York#The Poetry Brothel|Poetry Brothel]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/28/poetry-brothel-putting-bawd-in-bard |title=Poetry Brothel puts the bawd in bard |work=The Guardian |access-date=February 22, 2017}}</ref> and published critical prose.
