[[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] '''Charles Hamilton Sorley''' (19 May 1895 – 13 October 1915) was a [[British Army]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] and [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[war poet]] who fought in the [[World War I|First World War]], in which he was killed in action during the [[Battle of Loos]] in October 1915.

==Life and work==
Born in Powis House [[Aberdeen]], [[Scotland]], he was the son of philosopher and University Professor [[William Ritchie Sorley]].  He was educated at [[King's College School, Cambridge]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=A HISTORY of King's College Choir School Cambridge|author=Henderson, RJ|year=1981|page=42|ISBN=978-0950752808}}</ref> and then like [[Siegfried Sassoon]], at [[Marlborough College]] (1908–13). At [[Marlborough College]] Sorley's favourite pursuit was [[cross-country running]] in the rain, a theme evident in many of his pre-war poems, including ''Rain'' and ''The Song of the Ungirt Runners''. In keeping with his strict Protestant upbringing, Sorley had strong views on right and wrong, and on two occasions volunteered to be punished for breaking school rules.<ref>John Press, ''Charles Hamilton Sorley'' Cecil Woolf (War Poets Series), 2006</ref>

Before taking up a scholarship to study at [[University College, Oxford]], Sorley spent a little more than six months in [[Germany]] from January to July 1914, three months of which were at Schwerin studying the language and local culture. Then he enrolled at the [[University of Jena]], and studied there up to the outbreak of [[World War I]].<ref name="osborne">Osborne, E.B. ''[https://archive.org/details/newelizabethans007717mbp The New Elizabethans]''. NY: John Lane Company, 1919.</ref>

After Germany declared war on Russia, Sorley was detained for an afternoon in [[Trier]], but was released on the same day and told to leave the country.<ref name="fww">[http://www.firstworldwar.com/poetsandprose/sorley.htm Prose & POETRY – Charles Hamilton Sorley], First World War.com.  Retrieved 21 August 2009.</ref> He returned to England and immediately volunteered for military service in the [[British Army]]. He joined the [[Suffolk Regiment]] as a [[second lieutenant]] and was posted to the 7th (Service) Battalion, a [[Kitchener's Army]] unit serving as part of the [[35th Brigade (United Kingdom)|35th Brigade]] of the [[12th (Eastern) Division]]. He arrived on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in [[Boulougne]], [[France]] on 30 May 1915 as a [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]], and served near Ploegsteert. He was promoted to [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] in August 1915.

Sorley was killed in action near [[Hulluch]], having been shot in the head by a [[sniper]]<ref name="osborne"/><ref name="poets"/> during the final offensive of the [[Battle of Loos]] on 13 October 1915.<ref name="fww"/> Having no known grave at war's end, he is commemorated on the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission|CWGC]] [[Loos Memorial]].<ref>[http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/1769484/SORLEY,%20CHARLES%20HAMILTON] CWGC Casualty Record.</ref>

Sorley's [[When You See Millions of the Mouthless Dead|last poem]] was recovered from his kit after his death, and includes some of his most famous lines:

:''When you see millions of the mouthless dead''
:''Across your dreams in pale battalions go''

==Legacy==
''Marlborough and Other Poems'' was published posthumously in January 1916 and immediately became a critical success, with six editions printed that year. His ''Collected Letters'', edited by his parents, were published in 1919.

[[Robert Graves]], a contemporary of Sorley's, described him in his book ''[[Goodbye to All That]]'' as "one of the three poets of importance killed during the war". (The other two were [[Isaac Rosenberg]] and [[Wilfred Owen]].) Sorley may be seen as a forerunner of Sassoon and Owen, and his unsentimental style stands in direct contrast to that of [[Rupert Brooke]].

The last two stanzas of his poem ''Expectans expectavi'' were set to music in 1919 by [[Charles Wood (composer)|Charles Wood]]; this anthem for choir and organ quickly established itself in the standard repertoire of Anglican cathedrals and collegiate churches.

Sorley is regarded by some, including the [[Poet Laureate]] [[John Masefield]] (1878–1967), as the greatest loss of all the poets killed during the war.

On 11 November 1985, Sorley was among 16 Great War poets commemorated on a slate stone unveiled in [[Westminster Abbey]]'s [[Poet's Corner]]. The inscription on the stone was written by Wilfred Owen. It reads: "My subject is War, and the pity of War. The Poetry is in the pity."<ref name="poets">[http://net.lib.byu.edu/english/wwi/poets/poets.html Poets of the Great War] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922074012/http://net.lib.byu.edu/english/WWI/poets/poets.html |date=22 September 2008 }}.  Retrieved 21 August 2009.</ref>

''It Is Easy To Be Dead'' by [[Neil McPherson (artistic director)|Neil McPherson]], a play on his life, based on his poetry and letters, was presented at the [[Finborough Theatre]], [[London]], and subsequently at [[Trafalgar Studios]], [[London]], in 2016 where it was nominated for an [[Olivier Award]].<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jun/21/it-is-easy-to-be-dead-five-star-review-finborough-london-charles-hamilton-sorley The Guardian, 21 June 2016]</ref> It subsequently toured to Glasgow and Sorley's birthplace, Aberdeen, in 2018.

On 9 November 2018, an opinion commentary by [[Aaron Schnoor]] published in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' honored the poetry of World War I, including Sorley's poem "When You See Millions of the Mouthless Dead".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-great-war-produced-some-great-poetry-1541806343 |title=WSJ – The Great War Produced Some Great Poetry |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=9 November 2018 |access-date=28 April 2019}}</ref>
