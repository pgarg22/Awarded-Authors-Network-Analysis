'''John Gould Fletcher''' (January 3, 1886 – May 10, 1950) was an [[Imagist]] poet (the first Southern poet to win the [[Pulitzer Prize]]), author and authority on modern painting.<ref>Hughes, Glenn, ''Imagism and the Imagists'', Stanford University Press, New York 1931.</ref> He was born in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], to a socially prominent family.  After attending [[Phillips Academy|Phillips Academy, Andover]] Fletcher went on to [[Harvard University]] from 1903 to 1907, when he dropped out shortly after his father's death.

==Background==
Fletcher lived in [[England]] for a large portion of his life. While in [[Europe]] he associated with [[Amy Lowell]], [[Ezra Pound]], and other Imagist poets; he was one of the six Imagists who adopted the name and stuck to it until their aims were achieved.<ref>Glenn Hughes, ''Imagism and the Imagists'', Stanford University Press, New York, 1931</ref> Fletcher resumed a liaison with Florence Emily "Daisy" Arbuthnot (née Goold) at her house in Kent. She had been married to [[Malcolm Arbuthnot]] and Fletcher's adultery with her was the grounds for the divorce. The couple married on July 5, 1916. The marriage produced no children, but Arbuthnot's son and daughter from her previous marriage lived with the couple, who later divorced.

On January 18, 1936, Fletcher married a noted author of children's books, Charlie May Simon. The two of them built "[[Johnswood]]", a residence on the bluffs of the [[Arkansas River]], then outside Little Rock. They traveled frequently to New York for the intellectual stimulation, and to the American West and South for the climate, after Fletcher developed chronic [[arthritis]].

Fletcher suffered from depression, and on May 10, 1950, committed suicide<ref>{{cite book |last=Jamison|first=Kay R.|title=Touched with fire: manic-depressive illness and the artistic temperament|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T5jYtG0zDBgC&pg=PA249|access-date=15 June 2009|year=1994|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-684-83183-1|page=249|chapter=This Net Throwne Upon the Heavens}}</ref> by drowning himself in a pond near his home in Little Rock, Arkansas. Fletcher is buried at historic [[Mount Holly Cemetery]] in Little Rock. A branch of the [[Central Arkansas Library System]] is named in his honor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cals.org/fletcher-library/|title=Central Arkansas Library System|website=Central Arkansas Library System|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-07}}</ref>

==Poetry==

In 1913 [[Ezra Pound]] in his ''New Freewoman'' review commended Fletcher for the individuality of rhythm in his first volume of poems.<ref>Imagist Poetry, (ed. Peter Jone s) Penguin Books Ltd, London 1972 {{ISBN|0-14-042147-5}}</ref> Those early works include ''Irradiations: Sand and Spray'' (1915), and ''Goblins and Pagodas'' (1916). [[Amy Lowell]] said of him, "No one is more absolute master of the rhythm of [[free verse|verse libre]]".<ref>Lowell Amy, ''Tendencies of Modern American Poetry'', Macmillan, New York, 1917</ref> Fletcher invented the term 'polyphonic prose' to describe some poetic experiments of Amy Lowell,<ref>''Miss Lowell's Discovery: Polyphonic Prose''  Poetry, Chicago 1915</ref> a form he experimented with in ''Goblins & Pagodas''.<ref>''Imagist Poetry'', (ed. Peter Jones) Penguin Books Ltd, London 1972 {{ISBN|0-14-042147-5}}</ref>  In later poetic works Fletcher returned to more traditional forms. These include ''The Black Rock'' (1928), ''Selected Poems'' (1938), for which he won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]] in [[1939 Pulitzer Prize|1939]], "South Star" published by Macmillan (1941), and ''The Burning Mountain'' (1946). Fletcher later moved back to Arkansas to reconnect with his roots. The subject of his works turned increasingly towards [[Southern United States|Southern]] issues and traditionalism.

In the late 1920s and 1930s Fletcher was active with a group of Southern writers and poets known as the [[Southern Agrarians]].  This group published the classic [[Agrarianism|Agrarian]] manifesto ''I'll Take My Stand'', a collection of essays rejecting [[Modernity]] and [[Industrialism]]. In 1937 he wrote his autobiography, ''Life is My Song'', and in 1947 he published ''Arkansas'', a history of his home state.

[[Johnswood]], his Little Rock home, is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].
