By the later part of the 19th century, Boucicault had become known on both sides of the Atlantic as one of the most successful actor-playwright-managers then in the English-speaking theatre.  Although ''[[The New York Times]]'' hailed him in his obituary as "the most conspicuous English dramatist of the 19th century,"<ref name=Dead>{{Cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/77527432/dion-boucicault-dead/ |title=Dion Boucicault Dead |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=5 |date=19 September 1890 |access-date=2021-05-11 |via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> he and his second wife, Agnes Robertson Boucicault, had applied for and received American citizenship in 1873.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fawkes |first1=Richard |title=Dion Boucicault: A Biography |date=1979 |publisher=Quartet Books |location=London |page=187}}</ref>

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Boucicault was born Dionysius Lardner Boursiquot in [[Dublin]], where he lived on [[Gardiner Street]]. His mother was Anne Darley, sister of the poet and mathematician [[George Darley]]. The Darleys were an important Dublin family influential in many fields and related to the Guinnesses by marriage. Anne was married to Samuel Smith Boursiquot, of [[Huguenot]] ancestry,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=70EhAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA5 ''Dion Boucicault: Irish Identity on Stage''] p. 5, Deirdre McFeely, 2012 Cambridge University Press.</ref> but the identity of the boy's father is uncertain. He was probably [[Dionysius Lardner]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kent.ac.uk/library/specialcollections/theatre/boucicault/biography.html|title=Dion Boucicault Collections - Special Collections & Archives - University of Kent|website=www.kent.ac.uk}}</ref> a lodger at his mother's house at a time when she was recently separated from her husband,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=2woEAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA4 ''The career of Dion Boucicault''] Chapter 1, Walsh Townsend, 1915, {{ISBN|1-4325-5070-5}}, pp. 4–10</ref> with Lardner later giving Dion Boucicault financial support until about 1840.<ref name=boy>{{cite book|last=Boylan|first= Henry |year=1998|title=A Dictionary of Irish Biography, 3rd Edition|page=31|location=Dublin|publisher= Gill and MacMillan|isbn= 0-7171-2945-4}}</ref>

In 1828, Lardner was elected as professor of [[natural philosophy]] and [[astronomy]] at [[University College, London]], a position he held until he resigned in 1831. Anne Boursiquot followed him to London in 1828, taking all but one of her children with her. Consequently, from then on Boucicault attended various schools in and around London, about which there is a good deal of confusion, which has been dealt with by  Richard Fawkes in a biography. For about four years, from 1829, he seems to have attended a very small private school in [[Hampstead]] kept by a Mr Hessey, then between 1833 and 1835 was at [[University College School]], where he began his friendship with [[Charles Kenney]]. He later recalled having boarded in Euston Square with a Rev. Henry Stebbing, a historian. There is then a gap of two years, when Fawkes believes Boucicault may have attended [[Rowland Hill]]'s [[Bruce Castle School]], as stated in the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]''. In 1837, he was enrolled at Wyke House, a school at Sion Hill, [[Brentford]], kept by a [[Alexander Jamieson|Dr Alexander Jamieson]], where he appeared in a school play, in the part of Rolla in [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Sheridan]]'s ''Pizarro'', and wrote his own first play, ''The Old Guard'', which was produced some years later.<ref>Richard Fawkes, ''Dion Boucicault'' (Ardent Media, 2011), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QTSB1eopHbAC&pg=PA24 pp. 23–25]</ref> After that, according to some accounts he attended a school in Dublin, before returning to London as an [[apprentice]] [[civil engineer]] to Lardner.<ref name=record>Peter Thomson, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iC44AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA15 "Biographical Record"] in ''Plays by Dion Boucicault'' (CUP Archive, 1984), pp. 15–18</ref>

===Work as actor and playwright===
Boucicault abandoned his apprenticeship to take up an acting offer in [[Cheltenham]], adopting the stage name of Lee Morton.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hartnoll|first1=Phyllis|author-link=Phyllis Hartnoll|title=A concise history of the theatre|date=1968|publisher=[[Abrams Books|Harry N. Abrams]]|location=New York|isbn=9780684135212|page=192}}</ref> He joined [[William Charles Macready]] and made his first appearance on stage with Benjamin Webster at [[Bristol]]. Soon after this he began to write plays, occasionally in conjunction with his acting.

Boucicault's first play, ''A Legend of the Devil's Dyke'', opened in [[Brighton]] in 1838. Three years later, he had a big success as a dramatist with ''[[London Assurance]]''. First produced at [[Covent Garden]] on 4 March 1841, its cast included such well-known actors as [[Charles Mathews]], [[William Farren]], Mrs Nesbitt and [[Lucia Elizabeth Vestris|Madame Vestris]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

[[File:Houghton MS Thr 709 - Courbold, Corsican Brothers - crop.jpg|thumb|left|Painting by [[Edward Henry Corbould]] depicting a scene from Boucicault's ''The Corsican Brothers'', 1852]]
Boucicault rapidly followed this with a number of other plays, among the most successful being ''The Bastile'' {{sic}}, an "after-piece" (1842), ''Old Heads and Young Hearts'' (1844), ''The School for Scheming'' (1847), ''Confidence'' (1848), and ''The Knight Arva'' (1848), all produced at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]].<ref>[http://www.victorianweb.org/mt/theaters/pva234.html Victoria Web] accessed 1 June 2007</ref> He had further great successes with ''[[The Corsican Brothers (play)|The Corsican Brothers]]'' (1852, for [[Charles Kean]]) and ''Louis XI'' (1855), both adaptations of French plays.

In his ''The Vampire'' (1852), Boucicault made his début as a leading actor, appearing as the vampire Sir Alan Raby. Although the play itself had mixed reviews, Boucicault's characterisation was praised as "a dreadful and weird thing played with immortal genius".<ref>David J. Skal (2001) ''Vampires: Encounters With The Undead'': 47-8</ref> In 1854 he wrote ''Andy Blake; or, The Irish Diamond'' and also appeared in it, playing the title character.<ref name=utility>Stedman, Jane W. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3205899 "General Utility: Victorian Author-Actors from Knowles to Pinero"], ''Educational Theatre Journal'', Vol. 24, No. 3, October 1972, pp. 289–301, Johns Hopkins University Press</ref>

From 1854 to 1860, Boucicault resided in the United States, where he was always a popular favourite. Boucicault and his actress wife, Agnes Robertson, toured America. He also wrote many successful plays there, acting in most of them. These included the popular ''Jessie Brown; or, The Relief of Lucknow'' in 1858.<ref name=utility/>

===Work as theatre manager and producer===
From around 1855 his business manager and partner in New York was [[Edmund O'Flaherty|William Stuart]], an expatriate Irish MP and adventurer. Together they leased [[Wallack's Theatre]] in 1855-1856, and put on a short season at the Washington Theatre in [[Washington D.C.]]<ref name=Tribune_obit >[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1886-12-29/ed-1/seq-5.pdf "Death of William Stuart"], ''[[New-York Tribune]]'', December 29, 1886:5, col. 5. Online at Library of Congress.</ref><ref name=NYT_Obit >[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1886/12/29/103655189.pdf "Death of William Stuart"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 29, 1886.</ref>

In late 1855, while his wife was performing in St. Louis, Boucicault became the lessee of the Varieties Theatre in New Orleans. He quickly renamed it the Gaity and was set to open its doors on the 28th of November. A short delay pushed the opening night back to  December 1st with his play ''Used Up''. During his stay in New Orleans, a false report of his death began to circulate, this rumor was proven false when days later on December 20th he presented ''The Chameleon'' at the Gaiety. This was the first appearance of [[Agnes Kelly Robertson|Agnes Robertson]] at the Gaiety. Shortly after, on February 26th of 1856 Boucicualt was in the market to sell his lease. By March 8th he was out and heading to New York. <ref>Tolson. Julius H. "Dion Boucicault" Ph.D. Diss, University of Pennsylvania 1951.</ref> 

In the summer of 1859, Boucicault and William Stuart became joint lessees of Burton's New Theatre (originally Tripler's Theatre) on Broadway just below Amity Street. After extensive remodeling, he renamed his new showplace [[The Winter Garden Theatre (1850)|the Winter Garden Theatre]].<ref name=NYT_Obit />  There on 5 December 1859, he premiered his new sensation, the anti-slavery potboiler ''[[The Octoroon]]'', in which he also starred. This was the first play to treat seriously the Black American population.<ref name=boy/>

[[File:Contempt of Court 1879 poster.jpg|thumb|left|Poster for a production of Boucicault's [[farce]] ''Contempt of Court'', c. 1879. From the [[Library of Congress]].]]

Boucicault fell out with Stuart over money matters, and he went back to England. On his return he produced at the [[Adelphi Theatre]] a dramatic adaptation of [[Gerald Griffin (writer)|Gerald Griffin]]'s novel, ''The Collegians'', entitled ''[[The Colleen Bawn]]''. This play, one of the most successful of the times, was performed in almost every city of the United Kingdom and the United States. [[Julius Benedict]] used it as the basis for his Opera ''[[The Lily of Killarney]]''. Although it made its author a handsome fortune, he lost it in the management of various London theatres.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

After his return to England, Boucicault was asked by the noted American comedian [[Joseph Jefferson]], who also starred in the production of ''Octoroon'', to rework Jefferson's adaptation of [[Washington Irving]]'s ''[[Rip van Winkle]]''. Their play opened in London in 1865 and on Broadway in 1866.<ref name="Jefferson">{{cite book|last1=Jefferson|first1=Joseph|last2=Boucicault|first2=Dion|title=Rip Van Winkle (Introduction)|date=1895|publisher=Dodd, Mead and Company|pages=[https://archive.org/details/ripvanwinkle00jeffgoog/page/n7 401]–403|url=https://archive.org/details/ripvanwinkle00jeffgoog|access-date=23 May 2017}}</ref>

Boucicault's next marked success was at the [[Princess's Theatre, London]] in 1864 with ''Arrah-na-Pogue'' in which he played the part of a [[County Wicklow]], Ireland carman. This, and his admirable creation of "Conn"<ref>{{cite book|chapter=The Shaughraun|title=Plays of the Present|year=1902|author1=Clapp, John Bouvé|author2=Edgett, Edwin Francis|location=NY|publisher=The Dunlap Society|pages=[https://archive.org/details/playspresent00edgegoog/page/n309 247]–249|url=https://archive.org/details/playspresent00edgegoog}}</ref> in his play ''[[The Shaughraun]]'' (first produced at Wallacks Theatre, New York City, in 1874, then at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] in 1875), won him the reputation of being the best [[Stage Irish|"Stage Irishman"]] of his time. His reputation was also mentioned by [[W. S. Gilbert]] in the libretto of his 1881 operetta ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'' in the line: "The pathos of Paddy, as rendered by Boucicault".

Again in partnership with William Stuart he built the [[Abbey's Park Theatre|New Park Theatre]] in 1873–1874.<ref name=NYT_26_Sep_73 >{{cite news |title=The New Park Theatre |newspaper=The New York Times |page=8 |date=28 September 1873 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/77528062/the-new-park-theatre/ |access-date=2021-05-11 |via=Newspapers.com}}</ref><ref name=NYT_30_Mar_74 >{{cite news |title=The New Park Theatre |newspaper=The New York Times |page=5 |date=30 March 1874 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/77528177/the-new-park-theatre-1874-03-30/ |access-date=2021-05-11 |via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> However, Boucicault withdrew just before the theatre opened, and Stuart teamed up instead with the actor, playwright and theatre manager [[Charles Fechter]] to run the house.{{sfn|Watermeier|2015|p=48}}

In 1875 Boucicault returned to New York City, where he made his home and for a time his manager was [[Harry J. Sargent]].<ref>{{cite news|title=The Shaughraun|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/8746454/harry_j_sargent_manager_for_dion/|access-date=2021-05-11|via=Newspapers.com|newspaper=The Cincinnati Enquirer |page=8|date=December 29, 1876}}</ref> He wrote the melodrama ''Contempt of Court'' (poster, left) in 1879, but he paid occasional visits to London and elsewhere (e.g. Toronto<ref>{{cite journal|title=Music and Drama|journal=The Week : A Canadian Journal of Politics, Literature, Science and Arts|date=14 February 1884|volume=1|issue=11|page=176|url=https://archive.org/stream/weekcanadianjour01toro#page/n89/mode/1up|access-date=26 April 2013}}</ref>). He made his last appearance in London in his play, ''The Jilt'', in 1885.

Boucicault was an excellent actor, especially in pathetic parts. His uncanny ability to play these low-status roles earned him the nickname "Little Man Dion" in theatrical circles. His plays are for the most part adaptations, but are often very ingenious in construction. They have had great popularity.

===Family life===
Boucicault was married three times. He married the much older Anne Guiot at St Mary-at-Lambeth on 9 July 1845. He claimed that she died in a Swiss mountaineering accident later in the same year, though she may in fact have died as late as 1848.<ref>[http://library.kent.ac.uk/library/special/html/specoll/CB-GUIOT.HTM "Anne Guiot"] Calthrop Boucicault Collection [[University of Kent]] accessed 5 January 2009</ref><ref>As indicated by the [[Australian Dictionary of Biography|ADoB]] article on his son.</ref> In 1853, he eloped with [[Agnes Kelly Robertson]] (1833–1916) to marry in New York. She was [[Charles John Kean|Charles Kean]]'s ward; the juvenile lead in his company<ref>[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A030189b.htm "Boucicault, Dionysius George (Dot) (1859–1929)"] ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'' accessed 5 January 2009</ref> and an actress of unusual ability. She would bear Dion six children: Dion William Boucicault (1855–1876); Eva Boucicault (1857–1909); [[Dion Boucicault Jr.|Dion Jr.]] (1859–1929); Patrice Boucicault (1862–1890); [[Nina Boucicault]] (1867–1950); [[Aubrey Boucicault|Aubrey]] (1868–1913);<ref>{{iBDB name|name=Aubrey Boucicault|id=4354}} accessed 6 January 2009</ref> three of whom became distinguished actors in their own right. Patrice became a society singer, marrying George Pitman in 1885 but died in childbirth in 1890.<ref>[http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=SFC18901116.2.98# "The Late Patrice Boucicault"] ''San Francisco Morning Call'', 16 Nov 1890 - accessed 16 Feb 2015</ref> His granddaughter Rene Boucicault (1898–1935), Aubrey's daughter, became an actress and acted in silent films.

Between 11 July and 8 October 1885, Boucicault toured Australia, where his brother Arthur lived.<ref name=Josephine/> Towards the end of this tour, he suddenly left Agnes to marry Josephine Louise Thorndyke (c. 1864–1956), a young actress, on 9 September 1885, in Sydney.<ref name=Josephine>[http://library.kent.ac.uk/library/special/html/specoll/CB-THORN.HTM "Josephine Louise Thorndyke Boucicault"] Calthrop Boucicault Collection {University of Kent} accessed 5 January 2009</ref> This aroused scandal on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, as his marriage to Agnes was not finally dissolved until 21 June 1888, by reason of "bigamy with adultery." The rights to many of his plays were later sold to finance alimony payments to his second wife.<ref>[http://library.kent.ac.uk/library/special/html/specoll/CB-AGNES.HTM "Agnes Robertson Boucicault (1833–1916)"] Calthrop Boucicault Collection {University of Kent} accessed 5 January 2009</ref>

His last play, ''A Tale of a Coat'', opened at [[Daly's Theatre (30th St.)|Daly's Theatre in New York]] on 14 August 1890, and closed on 13 September 1890.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fawkes |first1=Richard |title=Dion Boucicault: A Biography |date=1979 |publisher=Quartet |location=London |pages=239, 241}}</ref>
