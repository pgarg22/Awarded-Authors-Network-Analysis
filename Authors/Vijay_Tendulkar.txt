'''Vijay Dhondopant Tendulkar''' (6 January 1928 – 19 May 2008) was a leading [[India]]n playwright, movie and television writer, literary essayist, political journalist, and social commentator primarily in [[Marāthi]].Vijay Tendulkar is one of India’s greatest playwrights , whose hard-hitting Marathi plays established him as an irreverent but brilliant writer of plays with contemporary, unconventional themes.<ref>{{Cite web|last=May 24|first=india today digital|last2=June 2|first2=2008 ISSUE DATE:|last3=May 24|first3=2008UPDATED:|last4=Ist|first4=2008 14:56|title=Legacy of Vijay Tendulkar|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/indiascope/story/20080602-legacy-of-vijay-tendulkar-736415-2008-05-24|access-date=2021-12-01|website=India Today|language=en}}</ref> He is best known for his plays ''[[Shantata! Court Chalu Aahe]]'' (1967), ''[[Ghāshirām Kotwāl]]'' (1972), and ''[[Sakhārām Binder]]'' (1972). Many of Tendulkar's plays derived inspiration from real-life incidents or social upheavals, which provide clear light on harsh realities. He has provided guidance to students studying "play writing" in US universities. Tendulkar had been a highly influential dramatist and theatre personality in [[Mahārāshtra]] for over five decades.

==Early life==
Vijay Dhondopant Tendulkar was born in a Gaud Saraswat Brahmins family<ref>Bhimrao, R.S., 2015.

The literary environment at home prompted young Vijay to take up writing. He wrote his first story at age six.

He grew up watching western plays and felt inspired to write plays himself. At age eleven, he wrote, directed, and acted in his first play.<ref>[http://www.indiaclub.com/shop/authorselect.asp?author=Vijay+Tendulkar Vijay Tendulkar profile at indiaclub]</ref>

At age 14, he participated in the 1942 Indian freedom movement,<ref>[http://www.flonnet.com/fl2224/stories/20051202001008500.htm ''The Frontline''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220161542/http://www.flonnet.com/fl2224/stories/20051202001008500.htm |date=20 February 2012 }}, Dec. 2005</ref> leaving his studies. The latter alienated him from his family and friends. Writing then became his outlet, though most of his early writings were of a personal nature, and not intended for publication. During this period, he participated in the activities of Nabajiban Sanghatana, a splinter communist group. He said that he liked sense of sacrifice and discipline of the communists.<ref>{{cite news |title=Vijay Tendulkar: Indian theatre's only complete philosopher |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/society-the-arts/story/19801231-vijay-tendulkar-indian-theatre-only-complete-philosopher-773665-2013-12-02 |access-date=23 July 2018 |work=India Today |language=en}}</ref>

==Early career==
Tendulkar began his career writing for newspapers. He had already written a play, ''Āmcyāvar Koṇ Preṃ Karṇār?'' ( Who is going to love me?), and he wrote the play, ''Gṛhastha'' (गृहस्थ; The Householder), in his early 20s. The latter did not receive much recognition from the audience, and he vowed never to write again.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20030717014829/http://hinduonnet.com/thehindu/lr/2003/02/02/stories/2003020200130200.htm ''The Hindu''], 2 February 2003</ref>

Breaking the vow, in 1956 he wrote ''Śrīmant'' Rich), which established him as a good writer. ''Śrīmant'' jolted the conservative audience of the times with its radical storyline, wherein an unmarried young woman decides to keep her unborn child while her rich father tries to "buy" her a husband in an attempt to save his social prestige.

Tendulkar's early struggle for survival and living for some time in tenements ("''cāḷ''/chawls") in [[Mumbai]] provided him first-hand experience about the life of urban lower middle class. He thus brought new authenticity to their depiction in Marathi theatre.<ref>[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20041003/spectrum/main3.htm ''The Tribune''], 3 October 2004</ref> Tendulkar's writings rapidly changed the storyline of modern Marathi theatre in the 1950s and the 60s, with experimental presentations by theatre groups like Rangayan. Actors in these theatre groups like [[Shriram Lagoo]], [[Mohan Agashe]], and [[Sulabha Deshpande]] brought new authenticity and power to Tendulkar's stories while introducing new sensibilities in Marathi theatre.<ref>[http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?newsid=4810&pageid=2 Shanta Gokhale, Theatre critic and writer]</ref>

Tendulkar wrote the play ''Gidhāḍe'' (गिधाडे; The Vultures) in 1961, but it was not produced until 1970. The play was set in a morally collapsed family structure and explored the theme of violence. In his following creations, Tendulkar explored violence in its various forms: domestic, sexual, communal, and political. Thus, ''Gidhāḍe'' proved to be a turning point in Tendulkar's writings with regard to establishment of his own unique writing style.<ref>[http://in.news.yahoo.com/070113/48/6b42w.html Violence 'Gidhade' and beyond]</ref>

Based on a 1956 short story, ''Die Panne'' ("Traps") by [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]], Tendulkar wrote the play, ''Śāntatā! Court Cālū Āhe'' (शांतता! कोर्ट चालू आहे; "Silence! The Court is in Session"). It was presented on the stage for the first time in 1967 and proved as one of his finest works. [[Satyadev Dubey]] presented it in movie form in 1971 with Tendulkar's collaboration as the screenplay writer.<ref>{{IMDb title|0295599|title=Shāntatā! Court Chālu Aahe}}</ref>


==1970s and 1980s==
In his 1972 play, ''[[Sakhārām Binder]]'' (Sakhārām, the Binder), Tendulkar dealt with the topic of domination of the male gender over the female. The main character, Sakhārām, is a man devoid of ethics and morality, and professes not to believe in "outdated" social codes and conventional marriage. He accordingly uses the society for his own pleasure. He regularly gives "shelter" to abandoned wives and uses them for his sexual gratification while remaining oblivious to the emotional and moral implications of his exploits. He justifies all his acts through claims of modern, unconventional thinking, and comes up with hollow arguments meant in fact to enslave women. Paradoxically, some of the women which Sakhārām had enslaved buy into his arguments and simultaneously badly want freedom from their enslavement.<ref>[http://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?html_title=&tols_title=Sakharam%20Binder%20(Play)&pdate=20041103&byline=Jonathan%20Kalb&id=1098953824821 THEATER REVIEW, 'SAKHARAM BINDER'], ''New York Times''</ref>

In 1972, Tendulkar wrote another, even much more acclaimed play, ''[[Ghāshirām Kotwāl]]'' ("Officer Ghāshirām"), which dealt with political violence. The play is a political satire created as a musical drama set in 18th century [[Pune]]. It combined traditional Marathi folk music and drama with contemporary theatre techniques, creating a new paradigm for Marathi theatre. The play demonstrates Tendulkar's deep study of group psychology,<ref>[http://www.lokvani.com/lokvani/article.php?article_id=1072 Lokvani, 07/30/2003]</ref> and it brought him a [[Jawaharlal Nehru Fellowship]] (1974–75) for a project titled, "An Enquiry into the Pattern of Growing Violence in Society and Its Relevance to Contemporary Theatre". With over 6,000 performances thus far in its original and translated versions, ''Ghāshirām Kotwāl'' remains one of the longest-running plays in the history of Indian theatre.

Tendulkar wrote screenplays for the movies ''[[Nishānt (film)|Nishānt]]'' (1974), ''[[Ākrosh (1980 film)|Ākrosh]]'' (The Cry) (1980), and ''[[Ardh Satya]]'' (The Half-Truth) (1984) which established him as an important "Chronicler of Violence" of the present.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080405191222/http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/09/02/stories/1302017i.htm Ashis Nandy on Violence in Vijay Tendulkar's works]</ref> He has written eleven movies in Hindi and eight movies in Marathi. The latter include ''Sāmanā'' ("Confrontation") (1975), ''Simhāasan'' ("Throne") (1979), and ''[[Umbartha]]'' ("The Threshold") (1981). The last one is a groundbreaking feature film on women's activism in India. It was directed by [[Jabbar Patel]] and stars [[Smitā Pātil]] and [[Girish Karnād]].

==1990s and beyond==
In 1991, Tendulkar wrote a metaphorical play, ''Safar'',<ref>[http://www.hotreview.org/articles/cyclistintro.htm An Introduction to 'The Cyclist', 2001]</ref> and in 2001 he wrote the play, ''The Masseur''. He next wrote two novels —  ''Kādambari: Ek'' and ''Kādambari: Don'' — about sexual fantasies of an ageing man. In 2004, he wrote a single-act play, ''His Fifth Woman'' — his first play in the English language — as a sequel to his earlier exploration of the plight of women in ''Sakhārām Binder''. This play was first performed at the Vijay Tendulkar Festival in New York in October 2004.<ref>[http://www.iaac.us Indo-American Arts Council (IAAC)], Vijay Tendulkar Festival, New York City, October 2004</ref>

In the 1990s, Tendulkar wrote an acclaimed TV series, ''SwayamSiddha'', in which his daughter [[Priyā Tendulkar]], noted Television actress of 'Rajani' fame,<ref>[[Priya Tendulkar]]</ref> performed in the lead role. His last screenplay was for ''Eashwar Mime Co.'' (2005), an adaptation of [[Dibyendu Palit]]'s story, ''Mukhabhinoy'', and directed by theatre director, [[Shyamanand Jalan]] and with [[Ashish Vidyarthi]] and [[Pawan Malhotra]] as leads.<ref>{{cite news |title=Special screening of Jalan's film |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-09-24/regional/28255782_1_special-screening-jalan-music |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308235630/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-09-24/regional/28255782_1_special-screening-jalan-music |url-status=dead |archive-date=8 March 2012 |newspaper=[[The Times of India]] |date=24 September 2010 }}</ref>

==Family==
He was the brother of acclaimed cartoonist and humourist [[Mangesh Tendulkar]].

==Death==
[[File:Vijay Tendulkar .jpeg|thumb|right| Vijay Tendulkar in late 2007 on a visit to Princeton, New Jersey, USA]]
Tendulkar died in [[Pune]] on 19 May 2008,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/story.aspx?id=NEWEN20080050271&ch=5/19/2008%209:56:00%20AM |title=Playwright Vijay Tendulkar passes away |work=NDTV.com |date=19 May 2008 |access-date=19 May 2008}}</ref> battling the effects of the rare autoimmune disease [[myasthenia gravis]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Vijay Tendulkar, voice of social stage, is dead |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1080520/jsp/nation/story_9295097.jsp |date=20 May 2008 |newspaper=The Telegraph |access-date=24 May 2008}}</ref>

Tendulkar's son Raja and wife Nirmala had died in 2001; his daughter [[Priya Tendulkar]] died the next year (2002) of a heart attack following a long battle with breast cancer.

==Comment on Post-Godhra communal carnage==
Following the post-Godhra communal carnage in Gujarat<ref>[[2002 Gujarat violence]]</ref> in 2002, Tendulkar reacted by saying that "If I had a pistol, I would shoot [Gujarat Chief Minister] [[Narendra Modi]]". This reaction of Tendulkar had evoked mixed reactions, local Modi supporters burning his effigies while others lauding his remark.

Later, when he was asked if it was not strange that he, who was known as a strong voice against death penalty, had a death wish for Modi, Tendulkar had said that "it was spontaneous anger, which I never see as a solution for anything. Anger doesn't solve problems."

==Political views==
Society and politics are strongly highlighted in Tendulkar's plays. Tendulkar had Leftist views. In particular, he was against Hindu social groups, especially against Brahmins; most of his dramas show Brahmins in a bad light.<ref name="foot">{{cite web|title=Treatment of Political Issues in The Plays of Vijay Tendulkar |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289822713 }}</ref>

==Legacy==
In his writing career spanning more than five decades, Tendulkar has written 27 full-length plays and 25 one-act plays. Several of his plays have proven to be Marathi theatre classics.<ref>[http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/LiteratureEnglish/WorldLiterature/India/?view=usa&ci=9780195676402 Profile at Oxford University Press]</ref> His plays have been translated and performed in many Indian languages.<ref name="indianexpress.com">[http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie/daily/19991020/ile20071.html The Indian Express, 20 October 1999] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201033510/http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie/daily/19991020/ile20071.html |date=1 December 2008 }}</ref>

By providing insight into major social events and political upheavals during his adult life, Tendulkar became one of the strongest radical political voices in [[Maharashtra]] in recent times. While contemporary writers were cautiously exploring the limits of social realism, he jumped into the cauldron of political radicalism and courageously exposed political hegemony of the powerful and the hypocrisies in the Indian social mindset. His powerful expression of human angst has resulted in his simultaneously receiving wide public acclaim and high censure from the orthodox and the political bigwigs.<ref>[http://www.ndtv.com/ent/booksexclusive.asp?id=655&frmsrch=1&txtsrch=vs Vijay Tendulkar speaks to NDTV]</ref>

Many of Tendulkar's plays derived inspiration from real-life incidents or social upheavals. Thus, the rise of [[Shiv Sena]] in Maharashtra in the 1970s was reflected in Tendulkar's ''Ghāshirām Kotwāl''.<ref name="indianexpress.com"/> The true story of a journalist who purchased of a woman from the rural sex industry to reveal police and political involvement in this trade, only to abandon the woman once he had no further need for her, is detailed in Tendulkar's ''Kamalā''.<ref>[http://www.eventsbangalore.net/2006/08/13/kamala-play-by-by-vijay-tendulkar/ Kamala story 1981]</ref><ref>[http://salaamtheatre.org/kamala2004.html Kamala at salaamtheatre]</ref> The play was later made into a film [[Kamla (film)]]. 
The real-life story of an actress whose acting career got ruined after her same-sex affair became public knowledge inspired Tendulkar to write ''Mitrāchi Goshta''.<ref>[http://www.humanitiesretooled.org/index.php?sm=hrt_review.php&modCMS_cidd=183 A study of the play and book, Mitrachi Goshta: A Friend's Story]</ref>

Tendulkar has translated nine novels, two biographies, and five plays by other authors into Marathi.

Besides the foregoing, Tendulkar's oeuvre includes a biography; two novels; five anthologies of short stories; 16 plays for children, including ''Bāle Miltāt'' (1960) and ''Pātlāchyā Poriche Lagin'' (1965); and five volumes of literary essays and social criticism, including ''Ratrani'' (1971), ''Kowali Unhe'' (1971), and ''Phuge Sobānche'' (1974). All in all, Tendulkar's writings have contributed to a significant transformation of the modern literary landscape in Marathi and other Indian languages.

In 2005, a documentary titled ''Tendulkar Āni Himsā: Kāl Āni Āj'' ("Tendulkar and Violence: Then and Now") with English subtitles<ref>[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/SUNDAY_SPECIALS/Book_Mark/Vijay_Tendulkar_answers_some_questions/articleshow/1490137.cms The Times of India, Jan 2007]</ref> (produced by California Arts Association - CalAA -<ref>[http://www.calaaonline.com California Arts Association (CalAA)]</ref> directed by Atul Pethe) was released. In 2007, a short film about Tendulkar, ''Ankahin'', (director Santosh Ayachit) was released.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080405185331/http://www.hindu.com/mp/2007/01/20/stories/2007012002590800.htm The Hindu, 20 January 2007]</ref>
