'''Mária Szepes''' ({{IPA-hu|ˈmaːriɒ ˈsɛpɛʃ}}; 14 December 1908 &ndash; 3 September 2007) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] author. She worked as a journalist and screenwriter, as well as an independent author in the field of [[Hermeticism|hermetic philosophy]] since 1941. She would sometimes write under the [[pseudonym]]s ''Mária Papir'' or ''Mária Orsi''.

==Life==
Szepes was born ''Magdolna Scherbach'' into a Hungarian family of theater stars in [[Budapest]]. Her father, Sándor Papir, was a ''[[wiktionary:bon vivant|bon vivant]]'' and great star of [[Budapest]]'s stages. Her mother was [[primadonna]]. Her parents and her brother were to her like "brothers and sisters in spirit", as well as she admitted only spiritual relationship: "Everything else is just experience, engagement, disengagement – [[karma]]."{{Clarify|date=April 2009}}

From 1916 to 1933, she appeared as a film actress (mostly under the name '''Magda Papir'''). One year after marrying [[Béla Szepes]] on 2 January 1931, she accompanied him to [[Berlin]], where they lived until Hungary's German occupation towards [[World War II|war]]'s end.  In her book ''Magie der Liebe'' ("Magic of Love"), Szepes writes about the marriage, which lasted 56 years, and discusses the so-called "Alchemistic Marriage", the dissolution of the ego in [[Other (philosophy)|the other]].

Szepes studied [[literature]], [[art history]], and [[biology]] in Berlin. Back in Hungary she first worked as a journalist, screenplay writer, and author. Her first [[novel]] ''[[The Red Lion (Mária Szepes novel)|The Red Lion]]'' was written in a hideout during [[World War II]] and became a worldwide bestseller of [[esoteric]] literature. The two ''[[Raguel]]'' volumes are referred to as her chief work by Szepes herself.

==''The Red Lion''==
''The Red Lion'', Mária Szepes' first novel, was published in 1946 in Hungary (original title: ''A Vörös Oroszlán''). During the [[Communism|communist]] regime [[Mátyás Rákosi|Rákosi]] ''The Red Lion'' was considered to be nonconformist and therefore was prohibited. All copies of the book were ordered to be destroyed. However, the [[librarian]] and novelist [[Béla Hamvas]] managed to save four copies. Then, several supporters of the author typed up the novel, made templates for printing, and released the self-made copies through the underground. Almost 40 years later, the novel arrived at the desk of the [[Heyne Verlag|Heyne]] publishing company via the agency Utoprop. The book was translated into German by Gottfried Feidel and was published as a paperback in 1984. More details regarding the history of origin are reported by [[Hans Joachim Alpers]] in his preface of the 2002 re-issue.

''The Red Lion'' has been adapted to stage and is performed in various theaters of the United States.

===Plot summary===
Szepes tells the story of the unhappy Hans Burgner, a miller's son born in the 16th century. After the death of his weak father and of a likewise miserable but beloved teacher, he becomes afraid of the unavoidable death of all living things. Driven by a monomania fed by persistent rumors of an [[Elixir]] of Immortality, he becomes an apprentice of a mysterious physician and [[Alchemy|alchemist]]. However, instead of listening to the Alchemist's compassionate counsel and warnings, Burgner is driven by feverish greed to murder him; in this way, he acquires the Elixir while he is still spiritually unprepared, and is cursed thereby. This is the starting-point of a journey through the centuries: while Burgner can physically die, the Elixir enables him to retain the full memory of his previous lives as he repeatedly reincarnates into a variety of different circumstances. It also bestows upon him a profound spiritual sensitivity. Several times he attempts the Great Transmutation in order to deliver himself from his self-imposed curse. Hans Burgner is refined through his various incarnations. Against the backdrop of the last five centuries of European history, he undergoes dramatic personal development: beginning as a spiritually unawakened (and even infamous) character, he matures spiritually through the various challenges he is led to confront. He is first an [[Initiation|initiate]] and Aspirant, eventually attaining the perfection of human personality which characterizes the [[Magus]], or spiritual Adept.
