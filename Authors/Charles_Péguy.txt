'''Charles Pierre Péguy''' ({{IPA-fr|ʃaʁl peɡi|lang}}; 7 January 1873 – 5 September 1914) was a French poet, essayist, and editor. His two main philosophies were socialism and nationalism, but by 1908 at the latest, after years of uneasy [[agnosticism]], he had become a believing but non-practicing [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]].<ref>"Peguy's Catholicism was closely allied with his love of France. Of him, as also of Psichari, it might almost be said that they were Catholics because they were Frenchmen. A non-Catholic Frenchman seemed a monstrosity, something cut off from the true life of his country. Some Catholicism is international or indifferent to country, with almost the motto, 'What matters country so long as the Church survives?' But that is not the Catholicism of these young Frenchmen, nor the Catholicism of the recent religious revival." – Rawlinson, Gerald Christopher (1917).

London: Robert Scott, p. 121.</ref><ref>"In France the classic type of the fervent but non-practising Catholic was probably best represented by Charles Péguy". — Kuehnelt-Leddihn, Erik von (1952).

From that time, [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] strongly influenced his works.

==Biography==
Péguy was born into poverty in [[Orléans]].<ref>MacLeod, Catriona (1937). "Charles Péguy (1873–1914)," ''The Irish Monthly'', Vol. 65, No. 770, pp. 529–541.</ref> His mother Cécile, widowed when he was an infant, mended chairs for a living. His father Désiré Péguy was a cabinet maker, who died in 1874 as a result of combat wounds. Péguy studied at the [[Lycée Lakanal]] in [[Sceaux, Hauts-de-Seine|Sceaux]], winning a scholarship at the [[École normale supérieure (Paris)]], where he attended notably the lectures of [[Henri Bergson]] and [[Romain Rolland]], whom he befriended. He formally left without graduating, in 1897, though he continued attending some lectures in 1898. Influenced by [[Lucien Herr]], librarian of the ''École Normale Supérieure'', he became an ardent [[Dreyfus Affair|Dreyfusard]].

In 1897, Péguy married [[Charlotte-Françoise Baudoin]]; they had one daughter and three sons, one of whom was born after Péguy's death. Around 1910 he fell deeply in love with [[Blanche Raphael]], a young Jewish friend; however, he was faithful to his wife.

From his earliest years, he was influenced by socialism. He joined the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] in 1895. From 1900 until his death in 1914, he was the main contributor to and the editor of the literary magazine ''Les Cahiers de la Quinzaine'', which at first supported the Socialist Party director [[Jean Jaurès]]. However, Péguy ultimately ended this support after he began viewing Jaurès as a traitor to the nation and to socialism. In the ''Cahiers'', Péguy published not only his own essays and poetry, but also works by important contemporary authors such as [[Romain Rolland]].

His free-verse poem, "Portico of the Mystery of the Second Virtue", has gone through more than 60 editions in France. It was a favorite book of [[Charles de Gaulle]].

When the [[World War I|first world war]] broke out, Péguy became a lieutenant in the 19th company of the French 276th Infantry Regiment. He died in battle, shot in the forehead, near [[Villeroy, Seine-et-Marne|Villeroy]], [[Seine-et-Marne]] on the day before the beginning of the [[First Battle of the Marne|Battle of the Marne]].<ref>Schmitt, Hans (1953). "Charles Péguy: The Man and the Legend, 1873–1953," ''Chicago Review'', Vol. 7, No. 1, pp. 24–37.</ref> There is a memorial to Péguy near the field where he was killed.

During the [[Second World War]] both supporters and opponents of [[Vichy France]] cited Péguy. [[Edmond Michelet]] was the first of many members of the [[French Resistance]] to quote Péguy; de Gaulle, familiar with Péguy's writing, quoted him a 1942 speech. Those who opposed Vichy's anti-Semitism laws often cited him. By contrast, [[Robert Brasillach]] praised Péguy as a "French National Socialist", and Péguy's sons Pierre and Marcel wrote that their father was an inspiration for Vichy's [[National Revolution]] ideology and "above all, a racist".<ref name="jackson2001">{{cite book | title=France: The Dark Years, 1940–1944 | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Jackson, Julian | year=2001 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/france00juli/page/4 4–5] | isbn=0-19-820706-9 | url=https://archive.org/details/france00juli/page/4 }}</ref> It has been written that Péguy would likely have been horrified by his future influence on fascism.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution|publisher=Princeton University Press | author=Sternhell, Zeev | year=1994 | pages=35 | isbn=0-691-03289-0}}</ref><ref>Zaretsky, Robert (1996).

The English novelist [[Graham Greene]] alluded to Péguy in ''[[Brighton Rock (novel)|Brighton Rock]]'', while ''[[The Heart of the Matter]]'' has as its epigraph a quotation from Péguy.<ref>Grahame C. Jones, "Graham Greene and the Legend of Péguy". ''Comparative Literature'', '''XXI'''(2), Spring 1969, pp. 138–40.</ref> In ''The Lawless Roads'' Greene refers to Péguy "challenging God in the cause of the damned".<ref>Quoted by Grahame C. Jones, in "Graham Greene and the Legend of Péguy", fn2, p. 139.</ref>

The Swiss theologian [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]], in the course of describing the history of art as an ongoing, sometimes more and sometimes less successful approximation of God's creativeness, noted that Péguy's Eve was a "theological redemption of the project of Proust", meaning that where Proust was gifted with memory and charity, the Eve of Péguy – not necessarily Péguy himself – was gifted with memory, charity, and direct knowledge of the redemption of God.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Nichols|first1=Aidan|title=The Word Has Been Abroad|pages=125}} Catholic University Press, 1998</ref>

English poet [[Geoffrey Hill]] published a book-length poem in 1983 in [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to Péguy, entitled ''The Mystery of the Charity of Charles Péguy''.<ref>Hill, Geoffrey (1985). ''Notes – Collected Poems''. London: Penguin Books.</ref>
