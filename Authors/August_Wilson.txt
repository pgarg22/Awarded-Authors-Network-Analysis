'''August Wilson''' (April 27, 1945 – October 2, 2005) was an American playwright. He has been referred to as the "theater's poet of Black America".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Isherwood|first=Charles|date=2005-10-03|title=August Wilson, Theater's Poet of Black America, Is Dead at 60 (Published 2005)|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/03/theater/newsandfeatures/august-wilson-theaters-poet-of-black-america-is-dead-at-60.html|access-date=2020-10-12|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> He is best known for a series of ten plays, collectively called ''The Pittsburgh Cycle'', which chronicle the experiences and heritage of the African-American community in the 20th century. Plays in the series include, ''[[Jitney (play)|Jitney]]'' (1982), ''[[Fences (play)|Fences]]'' (1984), ''[[Ma Rainey's Black Bottom]]'' (1984), ''[[Joe Turner's Come and Gone]]'' (1986),  ''[[The Piano Lesson]]'' (1987), ''[[King Hedley II]]'' (1999). Two of his plays received the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] (''Fences'' and ''The Piano Lesson''), and one the [[Tony Award for Best Play]] (''Fences''). In 2006 Wilson was inducted into the [[American Theater Hall of Fame]].

His works delve into the [[African American]] experience as well as examinations of the human condition. Other themes range from the systemic and historical exploitation of African Americans, as well as [[race relations]], identity, migration, and racial discrimination. His work has drawn several iconic performances onstage from [[James Earl Jones]], [[Denzel Washington]], [[Viola Davis]], [[Angela Bassett]], [[Phylicia Rashad]], [[Laurence Fishburne]], [[L. Scott Caldwell]] and [[Samuel L. Jackson]]. Davis said of Wilson's writing, "He captures our humor, our vulnerabilities, our tragedies, our trauma. And he humanizes us. And he allows us to talk."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/denzel-washington-on-bringing-august-wilsons-ma-raineys-black-bottom-to-the-screen/|title= Denzel Washington on bringing August Wilson's "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom" to the screen|website= CBS News|access-date= December 24, 2020}}</ref> Since Wilson's death two of his plays have been adapted into films: ''[[Fences (film)|Fences]]'' (2016) and ''[[Ma Rainey's Black Bottom (film)|Ma Rainey's Black Bottom]]'' (2020). Denzel Washington has shepherded the films and has vowed to continue his legacy by adapting the rest of his plays into films for a wider audience by saying, "The greatest part of what’s left of my career is making sure that August is taken care of".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.broadway.com/buzz/199971/denzel-washington-wants-samuel-l-jackson-to-star-in-film-of-august-wilsons-the-piano-lesson/|title= Denzel Washington Wants Samuel L.

==Early life==
Wilson was born '''Frederick August Kittel Jr.''' in the [[Hill District]] of [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania, the fourth of six children. His father, Frederick August Kittel Sr., was a [[Sudeten Germans|Sudeten German]] immigrant, who was a baker/pastry cook. His mother, Daisy Wilson, was an African-American woman from North Carolina who cleaned homes for a living.<ref Name="NYT">Isherwood, Charles (October 3, 2005), [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/03/theater/newsandfeatures/03wilson.html "August Wilson, Theater's Poet of Black America, Is Dead at 60"], ''The New York Times''.</ref> Wilson's anecdotal history reports that his maternal grandmother walked from [[North Carolina]] to [[Pennsylvania]] in search of a better life. Wilson's mother raised the children alone until he was five in a two-room apartment above a grocery store at 1727 Bedford Avenue; his father was mostly absent from his childhood. Wilson later wrote under his mother's surname. The economically depressed neighborhood where he was raised was inhabited predominantly by Black Americans and Jewish and Italian immigrants. Life for Wilson and his siblings was very tough because they were biracial. He struggled with finding a sense of belonging to a particular culture and didn't feel that he truly fit into African American culture or white culture until later in life. Wilson's mother divorced his father and married David Bedford in the 1950s, and the family moved from the Hill District to the then predominantly white working-class neighborhood of [[Hazelwood (Pittsburgh)|Hazelwood]], where they encountered racial hostility; bricks were thrown through a window at their new home. They were soon forced out of their house and on to their next home.<ref name= "Little 2000">{{cite book|last=Little|first=Johnathan|title=Twentieth-Century American Dramatists: Second Series|year=2000|publisher=Gale|location=[[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]|isbn=978-0-7876-3137-6|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/twentiethcentury228whea_0}}</ref> The Hill District went on to become the setting of numerous plays in the famous ''Pittsburgh Cycle''. His experiences growing up there with a strong matriarch shaped the way his plays would be written.

In 1959, Wilson was one of 14 African-American students at [[Central Catholic High School (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)|Central Catholic High School]], from which he dropped out after one year.<ref Name="NYT"/> He then attended Connelley Vocational High School, but found the curriculum unchallenging. He dropped out of Gladstone High School in the 10th grade in 1960 after his teacher accused him of [[plagiarism|plagiarizing]] a 20-page paper he wrote on [[Napoleon I of France]]. Wilson hid his decision from his mother because he did not want to disappoint her. At the age of 16 he began working menial jobs, where he met a wide variety of people on whom some of his later characters were based, such as Sam in ''The Janitor'' (1985).

Wilson's extensive use of the [[Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh]] resulted in its later "awarding" him an honorary high school diploma.  Wilson, who said he had learned to read at the age of four, began reading Black writers at the library when he was 12 and spent the remainder of his teen years educating himself through the books of [[Ralph Ellison]], [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], [[Langston Hughes]], [[Arna Bontemps]], and others.<ref name= "Little 2000" />

==Career==
=== 1960s ===
Wilson knew that he wanted to be a writer, but this created tension with his mother, who wanted him to become a lawyer. She forced him to leave the family home and he enlisted in the United States Army for a three-year stint in 1962, but he left after one year and went back to working various odd jobs as a porter, short-order cook, gardener, and dishwasher.

Frederick August Kittel Jr. changed his name to August Wilson to honor his mother after his father's death in 1965. That same year, he discovered the blues as sung by [[Bessie Smith]], and he bought a stolen typewriter for $10, which he often pawned when money was tight.<ref Name="Parisreview"/> At 20, he decided he was a poet and submitted work to such magazines as ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]]''.<ref Name="NYT"/> He began to write in bars, the local cigar store, and cafes—longhand on table napkins and on yellow notepads, absorbing the voices and characters around him. He liked to write on cafe napkins because, he said, it freed him up and made him less self-conscious as a writer. He would then gather the notes and type them up at home.<ref Name="NYT"/>  Gifted with a talent for catching dialect and accents, Wilson had an "astonishing memory", which he put to full use during his career. He slowly learned not to censor the language he heard when incorporating it into his work.<ref Name="Parisreview"/>

[[File:PittsburghPaAWH2.jpg|thumb|right|[[August Wilson House|Wilson's childhood home]] at 1727 Bedford Avenue in Pittsburgh]]

[[Malcolm X]]'s voice influenced Wilson's life and work (such as ''The Ground on Which I Stand,'' 1996). Both the [[Nation of Islam]] and the [[Black Power]] movement spoke to him regarding self-sufficiency, self-defense, and self-determination, and he appreciated the origin myths that [[Elijah Muhammad]] supported. In 1969 Wilson married Brenda Burton, a Muslim, and converted to Islam. He and Brenda had one daughter, Sakina Ansari-Wilson. The couple divorced in 1972.<ref name= "Little 2000" />

In 1968, along with his friend [[Rob Penny]], Wilson co-founded the [[Black Horizon Theater]] in the [[Hill District (Pittsburgh)|Hill District of Pittsburgh]].<ref Name="NYT"/> Wilson's first play, ''Recycling'', was performed for audiences in small theaters, schools and public housing community centers for 50 cents a ticket. Among these early efforts was ''[[Jitney (play)|Jitney]]'', which he revised more than two decades later as part of his 10-play cycle on 20th-century Pittsburgh.<ref name= "Little 2000" /> He had no directing experience.<ref Name="NYT"/> He recalled: "Someone had looked around and said, 'Who's going to be the director?' I said, 'I will.' I said that because I knew my way around the library. So I went to look for a book on how to direct a play. I found one called ''The Fundamentals of Play Directing'' <ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4X4UAAAAQBAJ|first1=Alexander|last1= Dean |first2=Lawrence |last2=Carra |date=2009 |title=Fundamentals of Play Directing|edition=5th |publisher=Waveland Press |location=Long Grove, IL |isbn=978-1-57766-648-6 }}</ref>  and checked it out."<ref Name="Parisreview"/>

=== 1970s ===
In 1976, Vernell Lillie, who had founded the [[Kuntu Repertory Theatre]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] two years earlier, directed Wilson's ''The Homecoming''. That same year Wilson saw ''[[Sizwe Banzi is Dead]]'', his first professional play, staged at the [[Pittsburgh Public Theater]]. Wilson, Penny, and poet Maisha Baton founded the Kuntu Writers Workshop to bring African-American writers together and to assist them in publication and production. Both organizations remain active.

In 1978 Wilson moved to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], at the suggestion of his friend, director [[Claude Purdy]], who helped him secure a job writing educational scripts for the [[Science Museum of Minnesota]].<ref Name="NYT"/> In 1980 he received a fellowship for [[The Playwrights' Center]] in Minneapolis. He quit the Museum in 1981, but continued writing plays. For three years, he was a part-time cook for the [[Little Brothers of the Poor]]. Wilson had a long association with the [[Penumbra Theatre Company]] of St. Paul, which premiered some of his plays. He wrote ''Fullerton Street'', which has been unproduced and unpublished, in 1980. It follows the [[Joe Louis]]/[[Billy Conn]] fight in 1940 and the loss of values attendant on the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to the urban North.<ref name= "Little 2000" />

=== 1980s ===
Throughout the 1980s, Wilson wrote the majority of his work including, ''[[Jitney (play)|Jitney]]'' (1982), ''[[Ma Rainey's Black Bottom]]'' (1984), ''[[Fences (play)|Fences]]'' (1985), ''[[Joe Turner's Come and Gone]]'' (1986), and ''[[The Piano Lesson]]'' (1987).

In 1987, St. Paul's mayor [[George Latimer (Minnesota politician)|George Latimer]] named May 27 "August Wilson Day". He was honored because he is the only person from Minnesota to win a [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]].<ref name= "Little 2000" />

=== 1990s ===
In 1990 Wilson left St. Paul after getting divorced and moved to [[Seattle]]. There he developed a relationship with [[Seattle Repertory Theatre]], which became the only theater in the country to produce his entire 10-play cycle and his one-man show ''How I Learned What I Learned.''<ref name= "Little 2000" />

Though he was a writer dedicated to writing for theater, a Hollywood studio proposed filming Wilson's play ''Fences''. He insisted that a black director be hired for the film, saying: "I declined a white director not on the basis of race but on the basis of culture. White directors are not qualified for the job. The job requires someone who shares the specifics of the culture of Black Americans." The film remained unmade until 2016, when [[Denzel Washington]] directed the film ''[[Fences (film)|Fences]]'', starring Washington and [[Viola Davis]]. It earned Wilson a posthumous Oscar nomination.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Viagas|first1=Robert|title=Denzel Washington's Fences Film Begins Shooting Today|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/denzel-washington-39-s-fences-film-begins-shooting-today-com-382902|date=April 22, 2016|work=Playbill|access-date=April 25, 2016}}</ref>

Wilson received many honorary degrees, including an honorary Doctor of Humanities from the [[University of Pittsburgh]], of which he was a trustee from 1992 until 1995.<ref>{{cite news | author=Bruce Steele | title=Remembering August Wilson 1945–2005 | url=http://www.umc.pitt.edu/media/pcc051010/august_wilson_2005OCT10.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902071459/http://www.umc.pitt.edu/media/pcc051010/august_wilson_2005OCT10.html | work=The Pitt Chronicle | publisher=The University of Pittsburgh | date=October 10, 2005 | archive-date=September 2, 2006| access-date=October 1, 2008}}</ref>

Wilson maintained a strong voice in the progress and development of the (then) contemporary Black theater, undoubtedly taking influences from the examples of his youth, such as those displayed during the [[Black Arts Movement]]. One of the most notable examples of Wilson's strong opinions and critiques of what was Black theater's state in the 1990s, was the "On Cultural Power: The August Wilson/Robert Brustein Discussion" where Wilson argued for a completely black theater with all positions filled by blacks. Conversely, he argued that Black actors should not play roles not specifically Black (e.g., no Black Hamlet). Brustein heatedly took an opposing view.

=== 2000s ===
In 2005, Wilson's final installment in his ten-part series ''The Century Cycle'', titled, ''Radio Golf'' opened. It was first performed in 2005 by the [[Yale Repertory Theatre]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] and had its [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] premiere in 2007 at the [[Cort Theatre]]. It would become known as Wilson's final work.<ref>{{Citation | last =Brantley | first =Ben | title =In the Rush to Progress, the Past Is Never Too Far Behind | work = [[The New York Times]] | date =9 May 2007 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/09/theater/reviews/09radio.html | access-date = 15 March 2017}}</ref>

==Post–Black Arts Movement==
While the work of August Wilson is not formally recognized within the literary canon of the [[Black Arts Movement]], he was certainly a product of its mission, helping to co-found the Black Horizon Theatre in his hometown of Pittsburgh in 1968. Situated in Pittsburgh's Hill District, a historically and predominantly Black neighborhood, the Black Horizon Theatre became a cultural hub of Black creativity and community building.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chronicle.pitt.edu/story/august-wilson-and-black-horizon-theatre|title=August Wilson and Black Horizon Theatre {{!}} Pitt Chronicle {{!}} University of Pittsburgh|website=www.chronicle.pitt.edu|access-date=2019-03-23}}</ref> As a playwright of what is considered the Post–Black Arts Movement, August Wilson inherited the spirit of BAM, producing plays that celebrated the history and poetic sensibilities of Black people. His iconic Century Cycle successfully tracked and synthesized the experiences of Black America in the 20th Century, using each historical decade, from 1904 to 1997, to document the physical, emotional, mental, and political strivings of Black life in the wake of emancipation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.august-wilson-theatre.com/plays.php|title=August Wilson, Pulitzer winning playwright: Plays|website=www.august-wilson-theatre.com|access-date=2019-03-23}}</ref>

Wilson's best-known plays are ''[[Fences (play)|Fences]]'' (1985) (which won a [[Pulitzer Prize]] and a [[Tony Award]]), ''[[The Piano Lesson]]'' (1990) (a [[Pulitzer Prize]] and the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award), ''[[Ma Rainey's Black Bottom]]'', and ''[[Joe Turner's Come and Gone]]''.

Wilson stated that he was most influenced by "the four Bs": blues music, the [[Argentine]] writer and poet [[Jorge Luis Borges]], the playwright [[Amiri Baraka]] and the painter [[Romare Bearden]].<ref Name="NYT"/> He went on to add writers [[Ed Bullins]] and [[James Baldwin]] to the list. He noted:

{{quote|From Borges, those wonderful gaucho stories from which I learned that you can be specific as to a time and place and culture and still have the work resonate with the universal themes of love, honor, duty, betrayal, etc. From Amiri Baraka, I learned that all art is political, although I don't write political plays. From Romare Bearden I learned that the fullness and richness of everyday life can be rendered without compromise or sentimentality.<ref Name="NYT"/>}}

He valued Bullins and Baldwin for their honest representations of everyday life.<ref Name="Parisreview"/>

Like Bearden, Wilson worked with collage techniques in writing: "I try to make my plays the equal of his canvases. In creating plays I often use the image of a stewing pot in which I toss various things that I'm going to make use of—a black cat, a garden, a bicycle, a man with a scar on his face, a pregnant woman, a man with a gun." On the meaning of his work, Wilson stated:

{{quote|I once wrote this short story called "The Best Blues Singer in the World", and it went like this—"The streets that Balboa walked were his own private ocean, and Balboa was drowning." End of story. That says it all. Nothing else to say. I've been rewriting that same story over and over again. All my plays are rewriting that same story.<ref Name="Parisreview"/>}}

===The ''Pittsburgh Cycle''===
<!-- Please note this began as the Pitt Cycle and sources still note it as such - The alternate title of Century Cycle is noted with refs in this section -->
Wilson's ''Pittsburgh Cycle'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/news/august-wilson-pittsburgh-cycle-century-cycle-plays-summary|title=August Wilson's 'Pittsburgh Cycle' Plays}}</ref> also often referred to as his ''Century Cycle'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marintheatre.org/productions/fences/fences-august-wilsons-century-cycle|title=10 Plays, 100 Years – Playwright August Wilson Reveals the History of a Community (From the Playbill)}}</ref> consists of ten plays—nine of which are set in Pittsburgh's Hill District (the other being set in Chicago), an [[African-American neighborhood]] that takes on a mythic literary significance like [[Thomas Hardy's Wessex]], [[William Faulkner]]'s [[Yoknapatawpha County]], or Irish playwright [[Brian Friel]]'s [[Ballybeg (fictional town)|Ballybeg]]. The plays are each set in a different decade and aim to sketch the Black experience in the 20th century and "raise consciousness through theater" and echo "the poetry in the everyday language of black America".<ref Name="Parisreview">{{cite journal| url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/839/the-art-of-theater-no-14-august-wilson| journal=The Paris Review| title=August Wilson, The Art of Theater No. 14| author= Bonnie Lyons, George Plimpton| date=Winter 1999 }}</ref> His writing of the Black experience always featured strong female characters and sometimes included elements of the supernatural. In his book, he wrote "My mother's a very strong, principled woman. My female characters . . . come in a large part from my mother"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Wilson|first=August|title=The Ground on which I Stand|publisher=Theatre Communications Group|year=2001|isbn=978-1559361873|pages=151}}</ref> As for the elements of the supernatural, Wilson often featured some form of superstition or old tradition in plays that came down to supernatural roots.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/august-wilson-the-ground-on-which-i-stand-august-wilsonbiography-and-career-timeline/3683/|title=August Wilson: The Ground on Which I Stand {{!}} Biography and Timeline {{!}} American Masters {{!}} PBS|date=2015-01-28|website=American Masters|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> One of his plays well known for featuring this is ''The Piano Lesson''. In the play, the piano is used and releases spirits of the ancestors. Wilson wanted to create such an event in the play that the audience was left to decide what was real or not. He was fascinated by the power of theater as a medium where a community at large could come together to bear witness to events and currents unfolding.<ref Name="Parisreview"/>

Wilson noted:

{{quote|I think my plays offer (white Americans) a different way to look at black Americans," he told ''The Paris Review''. "For instance, in ''Fences'' they see a garbageman, a person they don't really look at, although they see a garbageman every day. By looking at Troy's life, white people find out that the content of this black garbageman's life is affected by the same things – love, honor, beauty, betrayal, duty. Recognizing that these things are as much part of his life as theirs can affect how they think about and deal with black people in their lives.<ref Name="NYT"/>}}

Although the plays of the cycle are not strictly connected to the degree of a serial story, some characters appear (at various ages) in more than one of the cycle's plays. Children of characters in earlier plays may appear in later plays. The character most frequently mentioned in the cycle is Aunt Ester, a "washer of souls". She is reported to be 285 years old in ''[[Gem of the Ocean]]'', which takes place in her home at 1839 Wylie Avenue, and 349 in ''[[Two Trains Running]]''. She dies in 1985, during the events of ''[[King Hedley II]]''. Much of the action of ''[[Radio Golf]]'' revolves around the plan to demolish and redevelop that house, some years after her death. Aunt Ester is a symbolic and recurring figure that represents the African American struggle. She is "not literally three centuries old but a succession of folk priestesses... [s]he embodies a weighty history of tragedy and triumph".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/theater-dance/2009/11/09/August-Wilson-s-mythic-character-Aunt-Ester-explored-in-theater-festival/stories/200911090252|title=August Wilson's mythic character Aunt Ester explored in theater festival|website=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> The plays often include an ''apparently'' mentally impaired oracular character (different in each play)—for example, Hedley Sr. in ''[[Seven Guitars]]'', Gabriel in ''[[Fences (play)|Fences]]'', Stool Pigeon in ''[[King Hedley II]]'', or Hambone in ''[[Two Trains Running]]''.

Chicago's [[Goodman Theatre]] was the first theater in the world to produce the entire 10-play cycle, in productions which spanned from 1986 to 2007. Two of the Goodman's productions—''Seven Guitars'' and ''Gem of the Ocean''—were world premieres.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/stage/24839663-421/story.html | title=Court Theatre stages August Wilson's 'Seven Guitars' |first= Mary|last= Houlihan|date= January 8, 2014|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]}}</ref>

The [[Huntington Theatre Company]] of [[Boston]] has produced all 10 plays, finishing in 2012. During Wilson's life he worked closely with The Huntington to produce the later plays. [[Pittsburgh Public Theater]] was the first theater company in Pittsburgh to produce the entire Century Cycle, including the world premiere of ''[[King Hedley II]]'' to open the [[O'Reilly Theater]] in [[Downtown Pittsburgh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/the-final-installment-of-august-wilsons-epic-pittsburgh-cycle-premieres-at-the-public/Content?oid=1340845|title=The final installment of August Wilson's epic Pittsburgh Cycle premieres at the Public|first=Robert|last=Isenberg|date=October 2, 2008| newspaper=Pittsburgh City Paper}}</ref>

TAG – The Actors' Group, in Honolulu, Hawaii, produced all 10 plays in the cycle starting in 2004 with ''Two Trains Running'' and culminating in 2015 with ''Ma Rainey's Black Bottom''. All shows were Hawaii premieres, all were extremely successful at the box office and garnered many local theatre awards for the actors and the organization. The Black Rep in St. Louis and the Anthony Bean Community Theater in New Orleans have also presented the complete cycle.

In the years after Wilson's death the 10-play cycle has been referred to as ''The August Wilson Century Cycle''<ref>{{cite book|title=August Wilson Century Cycle|first=August|last=Wilson|year=2007|publisher=Theatre Communications Group|isbn=978-1559363075}}</ref> and as ''The American Century Cycle''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.openculture.com/2015/05/listen-to-playwright-august-wilsons-american-century-cycle-in-its-entirety-10-free-plays.html|title=Listen to Playwright August Wilson's American Century Cycle in Its Entirety: 10 Free Plays}}</ref>

Two years before his death in 2005, August Wilson wrote and performed an unpublished one-man play entitled ''How I Learned What I Learned'' about the power of art and the power of possibility. This was produced at New York's Signature Theatre and directed by Todd Kreidler, Wilson's friend and protégé. ''How I Learned'' explores his days as a struggling young writer in Pittsburgh's Hill District and how the neighborhood and its people inspired his cycle of plays about the African-American experience.<ref>{{Cite web|title=How I Learned What I Learned|url=http://publictheater.culturaldistrict.org/production/40795/how-i-learned-what-i-learned|work=publictheater.culturaldistrict.org|access-date = 2015-09-24}}</ref>
