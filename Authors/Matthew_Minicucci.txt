Hamilton Bailey Oregon Literary Fellowship, the Stanley P. Young Fellowship in Poetry from the [[Bread Loaf Writers' Conference]], and the [[James Merrill]] House, Minicucci was named the 2019 [[Dartmouth College]] Poet-in-Residence at the Frost Place.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=On Being Named the 2019 Dartmouth Poet in Residence |url=https://frostplace.org/dartmouth-poet-in-residence/2019matthewminicucci/ |work=The Frost Place |location=Franconia, NH |date=May 10, 2019 |access-date=20 May 2019}}</ref>

==Career==
After completing a degree in Classical Literature and Languages, Minicucci pursued his MFA at the University of Illinois; he has trained with [[Brigit Pegeen Kelly]], [[Tyehimba Jess]], and [[A. Van Jordan]]. His chapbook, ''Reliquary'', marshalls the [[Stations of the Cross]] to explore themes later positively received in the full-length ''Translation''. ''[[The Kenyon Review]]'' remarked the book's ″attention to craft as well as its thematic concerns and narrative devices [invoke] ancient history and myth to make sense of the poet's own personal history of loss.″<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Brunton |first=Jamie |date=February 3, 2017 |title=On Matthew Minicucci's Translation |url=https://www.kenyonreview.org/reviews/translation-by-matthew-minicucci-738439/ |magazine=The Kenyon Review |location=Gambler, OH |publisher=Kenyon College |access-date=May 19, 2019 }}</ref>

In his citation for the Oregon Book Award, judge and 2019 [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry|Pulitzer-prize]] winner [[Forrest Gander]] remarked<blockquote>The lexicon is inordinately rich, somehow both precise and lush. And the poems are insistently but never portentously philosophical, grounded as they are in bailing twine, bared teeth, baptismal tears. Disinterested in irony, softly-toned, Minicucci opens depths inside us that we can sense long after we’ve closed his book.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Book Award Finalists |magazine=2019 Oregon Book Award Ceremony Program |location=Portland, OR |publisher=Literary Arts |date=April 22, 2019}}</ref></blockquote>

Minicucci's poetry, essays, fiction, and reviews have appeared in ''[[Alaska Quarterly Review]]'', ''[[The Believer (magazine)|The Believer]]'', ''[[The Cincinnati Review]]'', ''[[Copper Nickel]]'', the ''[[Gettysburg Review]]'', ''[[Hayden's Ferry Review]]'', ''[[The Massachusetts Review]]'', ''Oregon Humanities'' magazine, ''[[Passages North]]'', ''[[Pleiades]]'', ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'', ''[[Poetry Northwest]]'', ''[[Salamander (magazine)|Salamander]]'', ''[[Southern Indiana Review]]'', ''[[The Southern Review]]'', ''Tupelo Quarterly'', the ''[[Virginia Quarterly Review]]'', and ''[[West Branch (journal)|West Branch]]'', among others. It has also been featured on ''Verse Daily'' and ''Poetry Daily''.
