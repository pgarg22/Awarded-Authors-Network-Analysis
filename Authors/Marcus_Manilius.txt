'''Marcus Manilius''' (fl. 1st century AD) was a Roman poet, [[astrologer]], and author of a poem in five books called ''[[Astronomica (Manilius)|Astronomica]]''.

==The ''Astronomica''==
{{main|Astronomica (Manilius)}}
The author of ''Astronomica'' is neither quoted nor mentioned by any ancient writer. Even his name is uncertain, but it was probably Marcus Manilius; in the earlier books the author is anonymous, the later give Manilius, Manlius, Mallius. The poem itself implies that the writer lived under [[Augustus]] or [[Tiberius]], and that he was a citizen of and resident in Rome, suggesting that Manilius wrote the work during the 20s CE. According to the early 18th century classicist [[Richard Bentley]], he was an Asiatic Greek; according to the 19th-century classicist Fridericus Jacob, an African. His work is one of great learning; he had studied his subject in the best writers, and generally represents the most advanced views of the ancients on [[astronomy]] (or rather [[astrology]]).<ref name=eb_1911>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle= Manilius |volume= 17 | pages = 580&ndash;581 }}</ref>

Manilius frequently imitates [[Lucretius]]. Although his diction presents some peculiarities, the style is metrically correct, and he could write neat and witty hexameters.<ref name=eb_1911/>

The astrological systems of [[House (astrology)|houses]], linking human affairs with the circuit of the [[zodiac]], have evolved over the centuries, but they make their first appearance in ''Astronomica''.  The earliest datable surviving horoscope that uses houses in its interpretation is slightly earlier, c. 20 BC. [[Claudius Ptolemy]] (c. AD 130–170) almost completely ignored houses (''templa'' as Manilius calls them) in his astrological text, ''[[Tetrabiblos]]''.<ref name=eb_1911/>

The work is also known for being the subject of the most salient of [[A. E. Housman]]'s scholarly endeavours; his annotated edition he considered his magnum opus, and when the fifth and final volume was published in 1930, 27 years after the first, he remarked he would now "do nothing forever and ever." He nonetheless also thought that it was an  obscure pursuit; to an American correspondent he wrote, "I do not send you a copy, as it would shock you very much; it is so dull that few professed scholars can read it, probably not one in the whole United States."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/v29/n13/frank-kermode/nothing-for-ever-and-ever|title=Nothing for Ever and Ever|first=Frank|last=Kermode|date=5 July 2007|pages=7–8|access-date=27 April 2017|via=''London Review of Books''}}</ref> It remains a source of bafflement to many that Housman should have elected to abandon, as they thought, a poet like [[Propertius]] in favour of Manilius (though in fact he completed an edition of Propertius, but could not get it published). For example, the critic [[Edmund Wilson]] pondered the countless hours Housman devoted to Manilius and concluded, "Certainly it is the spectacle of a mind of remarkable penetration and vigor, of uncommon sensibility and intensity, condemning itself to duties which prevent it from rising to its full height."  This is, however, to misunderstand the technical task of editing a classical text.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Edmund Wilson: Literary Essays and Reviews of the 1930s & 1940s|last=Wilson|first=Edmund|publisher=Library of America|year=2007|isbn=978-1-59853-014-8|location=New York|pages=71}}</ref>
