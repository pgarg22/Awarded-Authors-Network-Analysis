'''Marcus Samuel Blitzstein''' (March 2, 1905{{spaced ndash}}January 22, 1964), was an American composer, lyricist, and librettist.<ref>[http://arcat.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?BBID=127 Marc Blitzstein Papers, Wisconsin Historical Society, retrieved 12 January 2014.]</ref> He won national attention in 1937 when his pro-[[Trade union|union]] musical ''[[The Cradle Will Rock]]'', directed by [[Orson Welles]], was shut down by the [[Works Progress Administration]]. He is known for ''The Cradle Will Rock'' and for his [[Off-Broadway]] translation/adaptation of ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'' by [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Kurt Weill]]. His works also include the opera ''[[Regina (opera)|Regina]]'', an adaptation of [[Lillian Hellman]]'s play ''[[The Little Foxes]]''; the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[musical theater|musical]] ''[[Juno (musical)|Juno]]'', based on [[Seán O'Casey]]'s play ''[[Juno and the Paycock]]''; and ''[[No for an Answer]]''. He completed translation/adaptations of Brecht's and Weill's musical play ''[[Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny]]'' and of Brecht's play ''[[Mother Courage and Her Children]]'' with music by [[Paul Dessau]]. Blitzstein also composed music for films, such as ''Surf and Seaweed'' (1931) and ''[[The Spanish Earth]]'' (1937), and he contributed two songs to the original 1960 production of Hellman's play ''[[Toys in the Attic (play)|Toys in the Attic]]''.

[[Image:Cradle-Will-Rock-Cast.jpg|right|thumb|260px|Marc Blitzstein and the cast of ''[[The Cradle Will Rock]]'' (1937)]]
Blitzstein was born in Philadelphia on March 2, 1905, to affluent parents. Blitzstein's musical gifts were apparent at an early age; he had performed a [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] piano concerto by the time he was seven. He went on to study [[piano]] with [[Alexander Siloti]] (a pupil of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] and [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]]), and made his professional concerto debut with the Philadelphia Orchestra in Liszt's [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Liszt)|E-flat Piano Concerto]] when he was 21.

After studying composition at the [[Curtis Institute of Music]], he went to [[Europe]] to continue his studies in [[Berlin]] with [[Arnold Schoenberg]] (with whom he did not get on), and in [[Paris]] with [[Nadia Boulanger]] (with whom he did). Despite his later political beliefs, he was, in the early years of his career, a self-proclaimed and unrepentant artistic snob, who firmly believed that true art was only for the intellectual elite. He was vociferous in denouncing composers—in particular [[Ottorino Respighi|Respighi]],  [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]], and [[Kurt Weill]]—who, he felt, debased their standards to reach a wider public.

His works of this period, mostly pianistic vehicles such as the ''Piano Sonata'' (1927) and the ''Piano Concerto'' (1931) are typical of the Boulanger-influenced products of American modernism&nbsp;— strongly rhythmic (though not influenced by [[jazz]]) and described by himself as "wild, dissonant and percussive."  These early works were far removed from the Schoenberg style.

The dramatic premiere of the pro-[[labor union|union]] ''The Cradle Will Rock'' took place at the Venice Theater on June 16, 1937. The cast had been locked out of the [[Maxine Elliott Theatre]] by the [[Works Progress Administration]], the government agency which had originally funded the production, so the cast and musicians walked with the audience to the nearby Venice. There, without costumes or sets, they performed the work concert-style, actors and musicians alike, sitting among the audience (to evade union restrictions on their performance) with Blitzstein narrating from the piano. In 1939,  [[Leonard Bernstein]] led a revival of the play at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], narrating from the piano just as Blitzstein had done. Blitzstein attended the performance, after which he and Bernstein became close friends; Bernstein would later say that Blitzstein's contribution to the American musical theatre was "incalculable".<ref name=lww>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uQop2edOXrkC&pg=RA1-PA1975|last=Pollack|first=Howard|title=Marc Blitzstein: His Life, His Work, His World|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199977086}}</ref> The 1999 film ''[[Cradle Will Rock]]'' was based on this event, though heavily embellished. In the film, Blitzstein (played by [[Hank Azaria]]) is portrayed as gaining inspiration through ghostly appearances by his idol Brecht and his late anorexic wife.<ref name=lww />

Additional major compositions include the autobiographical radio song play ''[[I've Got the Tune]]'', ''[[The Airborne Symphony]]'' (1946), ''[[Regina (opera)|Regina]]'' (1949), ''[[Reuben, Reuben (opera)|Reuben, Reuben]]'' (1955), and ''[[Juno (musical)|Juno]]'' (1959). At the time of his death Blitzstein was at work on ''[[Idiots First]]'', a one-act [[opera]] based on the eponymous story by [[Bernard Malamud]]&nbsp;– intended to be part of a set of one-acters called ''[[Tales of Malamud]]''&nbsp;– which [[Ned Rorem]] has called "his best work". This was followed by the work Blitzstein intended to be his ''magnum opus'', a three-act opera commissioned by the [[Ford Foundation]] and optioned by the [[Metropolitan Opera]] entitled ''Sacco and Vanzetti''. Both ''Tales of Malamud'' and ''Sacco and Vanzetti'' were completed posthumously, with the approval of Blitzstein's estate, by composer [[Leonard Lehrman]]. Lehrman's long-awaited ''Marc Blitzstein: A Bio-Bibliography'', published in 2005 by [[Praeger Publishers|Praeger]], is the longest published biographical bibliography of any American composer at 645 pages.<ref>{{cite document|url=http://www.greenwood.com/catalog/GR0027.aspx |title=Marc Blitzstein&nbsp;— www.greenwood.com |doi=10.1336/0313300275 |publisher=Greenwood.com |date=2005-09-30 |access-date=2010-03-29}}</ref>

In 1958, Blitzstein was subpoenaed to appear before the U.S. [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]] (HUAC). Appearing first in a closed session, Blitzstein admitted his membership in the Communist Party (ending in 1949) and, challenging the right of HUAC to question him at all, refused to name names or cooperate any further. He was recalled for a further public session, but after a day sitting anxiously in a waiting room he was not called to testify.<ref>Jansson, John (2001).

During a visit to [[Martinique]] in 1964, at the age of 58, Blitzstein was murdered by three sailors he had picked up in a bar,<ref name="Moonlight"/> one of whom he was said to have propositioned. He is buried at Chelten Hills Cemetery in [[Philadelphia]].<ref>Wilson, Scott. ''Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons'', 3d ed.: 2 (Kindle Locations 4244-4245).

She died of [[anorexia nervosa|anorexia]] in 1936, and his grief prompted him to throw himself into the work of creating ''The Cradle Will Rock''.<ref>Jansson, John (2001).
