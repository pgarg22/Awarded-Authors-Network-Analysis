'''Edwin George Morgan''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OBE|FRSE}} (27 April 1920 &ndash; 17 August 2010)<ref name="Independent">[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/professor-edwin-morgan-writer-celebrated-as-one-of-the-finest-scottish-poets-of-the-20th-century-2057166.html Professor Edwin Morgan: Writer celebrated as one of the finest Scottish poets of the 20th century], ''[[The Independent]]''.</ref> was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] poet and translator associated with the [[Scottish Renaissance]]. He is widely recognised as one of the foremost Scottish poets of the 20th century. In 1999, Morgan was made the first Glasgow [[Poet Laureate]]. In 2004, he was named as the first [[Makar (National Poet for Scotland)|Makar]] or National Poet for Scotland.

==Life and career==
Morgan was born in [[Glasgow]] and grew up in [[Rutherglen, Glasgow|Rutherglen]]. His parents were [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]]. As a child he was not surrounded by books, nor did he have any literary acquaintances. Schoolmates labelled him a swot. He convinced his parents to finance his membership of several book clubs in Glasgow. The ''Faber Book of Modern Verse'' (1936) was a "revelation" to him, he later said.<ref name="Zest and grit">{{cite news|author=Crown, Sarah|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jan/26/poetry|title=Zest and grit|date=26 January 2008|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|access-date=26 January 2008}}</ref>

Morgan entered the [[University of Glasgow]] in 1937. It was at university that he studied French and Russian, while self-educating in "a good bit of Italian and German" as well.<ref name="Zest and grit"/> After interrupting his studies to serve in [[World War II]] as a [[non-combatant]] [[conscientious objector]] with the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]], Morgan graduated in 1947 and became a lecturer at the University. He worked there until his retirement as a full professor in 1980.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vMBAAAAAIBAJ&pg=5885%2C5990970 |title=Glasgow's Galactic Bard |first=Raymond |last=Gardner |work=The Glasgow Herald |date=26 April 1980| page=9 |access-date=23 July 2017}}</ref>

Morgan described 'CHANGE RULES!' as 'the supreme graffito', whose liberating double-take suggests both a lifelong commitment to formal experimentation and his radically democratic left-wing political perspectives. From traditional sonnet to blank verse, from epic seriousness to camp and ludic nonsense; and whether engaged in time-travelling space fantasies or exploring contemporary developments in physics and technology, the range of Morgan's voices is a defining attribute.<ref>See Colin Nicholson, Edwin Morgan: Inventions of Modernity (Manchester 2002)</ref>

Morgan first outlined his sexuality in ''Nothing Not Giving Messages: Reflections on his Work and Life'' (1990).<ref name="gayinterview">{{Cite book |title=Ethically Speaking: Voice and Values in Modern Scottish Writing |url=https://archive.org/details/ethicallyspeakin00mcgo |url-access=limited |editor-first=James |editor-last=McGonigal |editor2-first=Kirsten |editor2-last=Stirling |publisher=Rodopi |year=2006 |first=James |last=McGonigal |chapter=Gay Writing in Scotland: An Interview with Edwin Morgan |isbn=90-420-2084-9 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/ethicallyspeakin00mcgo/page/n139 139]–56 }}</ref> He had written many famous love poems, among them "Strawberries" and "The Unspoken", in which the love object was not gendered; this was partly because of legal problems at the time but also out of a desire to universalise them, as he made clear in an interview with Marshall Walker.<ref>[http://www.carcanet.co.uk/cgi-bin/scribe?showdoc=15;doctype=interview Carcanet Press].</ref> At the opening of the [[Glasgow LGBT Centre]] in 1995, he read a poem he had written for the occasion, and presented it to the centre as a gift.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hepworth |first1=Sarah |title=LGBT History Month: poem that launched GGLC |url=https://universityofglasgowlibrary.wordpress.com/2014/02/20/lgbt-history-month-poem-that-launched-gglc/ |website=University of Glasgow Library Blog |access-date=14 September 2021}}</ref>

In 2002, he became the patron of [[Our Story Scotland]]. At the opening of the [[Scottish Parliament]] building in [[Edinburgh]] on 9 October 2004, [[Liz Lochhead]] read a poem written for the occasion by Morgan, titled "Poem for the Opening of the Scottish Parliament".  She was announced as Morgan's successor as Scots Makar in January 2011.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-12227515|title=Liz Lochhead confirmed as new Scots Makar|date=19 January 2011|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|access-date=19 January 2011}}</ref>

Near the end of his life, Morgan reached a new audience after collaborating with the Scottish band [[Idlewild (band)|Idlewild]] on their album ''[[The Remote Part]]''. In the closing moments of the album's final track "In Remote Part/ Scottish Fiction", he recites a poem, "Scottish Fiction", written specifically for the song.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Simpson |first1=Dave |title=Idlewild, The Remote Part |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2002/jul/12/popandrock.artsfeatures1 |access-date=14 September 2021 |work=The Guardian |date=12 July 2002}}</ref>

In 2007, Morgan contributed two poems to the compilation ''[[Ballads of the Book]]'', for which a range of Scottish writers created poems to be made into songs by Scottish musicians. Morgan's songs "The Good Years" and "The Weight of Years" were performed by [[Karine Polwart]] and Idlewild respectively.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Johnstone |first1=Doug |title=Ballads of the Book |url=https://www.list.co.uk/article/1415-ballads-of-the-book/ |access-date=14 September 2021 |work=The List |date=27 February 2007}}</ref>

In later life Morgan was cared for at a residential home as his health worsened. He published a collection in April 2010, months before his death, titled ''Dreams and Other Nightmares''<ref name="Telegraph Obituary"/> to mark his 90th birthday.<ref name="Guardian Obituary"/> Up until his death, he was the last survivor of the canonical 'Big Seven' (the others being [[Hugh MacDiarmid]], [[Robert Garioch]], [[Norman MacCaig]], [[Iain Crichton Smith]], [[George Mackay Brown]], and [[Sorley MacLean]]).

==Poetry==
[[File:Pavement poetry - geograph.org.uk - 1483709.jpg|thumb|Poetry by Edwin Morgan inscribed on the pavement on Candleriggs, Glasgow.]]
Morgan worked in a wide range of forms and styles, from the [[sonnet]] to [[concrete poetry]]. His ''Collected Poems'' appeared in 1990. He has also translated from a wide range of languages, including Russian, Hungarian, French, Italian, [[Latin]], Spanish, Portuguese, German and [[Old English]] (''Beowulf''). Many of these are collected in ''Rites of Passage. Selected Translations'' (1976). His 1952 translation of ''Beowulf'' has become a standard translation in America.<ref name="Telegraph Obituary">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/books-obituaries/7954871/Edwin-Morgan.html|title=Obituary: Edwin Morgan|date=19 August 2010|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=19 August 2010}}</ref>

Morgan was also influenced by the American [[beat generation|beat]] poets, with their simple, accessible ideas and language being prominent features in his work.

His poetry may be studied as a Scottish Text for [[Curriculum for Excellence|National 5 English]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Scottish Qualifications Authority|first=Resource Management|title=English - Course overview and resources|url=https://www.sqa.org.uk/sqa/45672.html|access-date=2020-09-03|website=www.sqa.org.uk}}</ref> Currently, if Edwin Morgan is studied at National 5, pupils study:  "Winter" - a depressed narrator describing Bingham's pond during winter; "In the Snackbar"; "Glasgow 5 March 1971"; "Good Friday" - a poem about a bus journey on [[Good Friday|the christian holiday]]; "Trio" - a tale about the power of friendship; Glasgow Sonnet (I) - a [[petrarchan sonnet]] about poverty.

In 1968 Morgan wrote "Starlings in George Square". This poem could be read as a comment on society's reluctance to accept the integration of different races. Other people have also considered it to be about the Russian Revolution in which "Starling" could be a reference to "Stalin".

Other notable poems include:

* "The Death of Marilyn Monroe" (1962) &ndash; an outpouring of emotion and a social criticism after the death of prominent actress, [[Marilyn Monroe]]
* "King Billy" (1968) &ndash; flashback of the gang warfare in Glasgow led by Billy Fullerton in the 1930s.
* "Glasgow 5 March 1971" &ndash; robbery by two youths by pushing an unsuspecting couple through a shop window on [[Sauchiehall Street]]
* "In the Snackbar" &ndash; concise description of an encounter with a disabled pensioner in a Glasgow café.
* "A Good Year for Death" (26 September 1977) &ndash; a description of five famous people from the world of popular culture who died in 1977
* "Poem for the Opening of the Scottish Parliament" &ndash; which was read by [[Liz Lochhead]] at the opening ceremony because he was too ill to read it in person. (9 October 2004)
