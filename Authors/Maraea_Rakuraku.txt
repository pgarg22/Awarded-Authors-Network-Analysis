Rakuraku works to provide space for those peoples who sit on the margins while exploring the continued impact of colonialism in 21st Century Aotearoa.

==Radio==
Rakuraku’s love for National radio emerged in her youth as she grew up listening to children’s programs every Sunday. In her time at [[Canterbury University]] she began broadcasting on the Māori students’ radio show. Several years and degrees later, while living in Auckland, Rakuraku completed two years as a volunteer for a talkback (Nga Mane Aute) at [[Radio Waatea]]. Later, she spent some time hosting a three hour program on [[KFM Radio]]. In 2006, Maraea joined [[Radio New Zealand]] as co-producer and presenter of the Kaupapa Māori programme Te Ahi Kaa, sharing the role with Justine Murray.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Upbeat|title=The next Stage for Female Maori Playwright.|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/concert/programmes/upbeat/audio/201825857/the-next-stage-for-female-maori-playwright|website=Radio New Zealand|publisher=Te Ao Maori|accessdate=10 April 2017}}</ref>

==Plays==
Rakuraku’s first full-length play ''The Prospect''<ref>{{cite news|last1=Atkinson|first1=Laurie|title=Powerful depiction of town under siege|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/culture/performance/7583418/Powerful-depiction-of-town-under-siege|work=[[Stuff.co.nz]]|accessdate=11 April 2017}}</ref> was awarded three [[Chapman Tripp Theatre Awards]] in 2012, including New Playwright of the Year.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/CU1212/S00148/the-chapman-tripp-theatre-awards-2012-winners.htm|title=The Chapman Tripp Theatre Awards 2012 Winners|date=10 December 2012|work=[[Stuff.co.nz]]}}</ref> In 2012, Rakuraku also took home the annual Tau Mai e Kapiti Writer in Residence award. The play explores the trauma of colonization: “'How one culture assimilates another and the trail of destruction wrought as a result.' And there are moments that also echo the atrocities and justifications wrought by fundamentalism in every guise around the world and throughout history. In short, The Prospect proves how universal a culturally specific story can be. As for the prospects for our futures – that's up to us all, and seeing this play will contribute greatly to our collective understanding, as well as giving us a rich and insightful theatrical experience."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Smythe|first1=John|title=THE PROSPECT - A rich and insightful theatrical experience|url=https://www.theatreview.org.nz/reviews/review.php?id=5088|website=theatreview|accessdate=10 April 2017}}</ref>

Rakuraku’s second play, ''Tan-Knee'', is the first of a planned trilogy, about a family of the Tūhoe iwi (tribe). After returning home from a successful boxing career, Tū is planning to re-open the Boxing Gym Muhammad's in his home town with his brother Pōtiki and their cousin Eunice. Twenty years have passed since Tū was last home and the town of Taneatua, known as Tan-Knee, is not as he remembers it.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tan-Knee by Maraea Rakuraku - The Next Stage|url=https://www.thebigidea.nz/events/211561-tan-knee-by-maraea-rakuraku-the-next-stage|website=The Big Idea|accessdate=10 April 2017}}</ref>
Rakuraku wrote the play in response to the 2007 raids of Te Urewera areas and lock downs by the State and the ongoing objectification of the Tūhoe iwi in the media. 
For this play she was awarded the Adam NZ Play Award in 2016. She also received awards for Best Play by a Māori Writer and Best Play by a Women Writer.<ref name=triple>{{cite web|url=http://www.victoria.ac.nz/modernletters/about/news/news-archives/2016-news/triple-win-at-adam-nz-play-awards-for-maraea-rakuraku|title=Triple win for Maraea Rakuraku at Adam NZ Play Awards | publisher= International Institute of Modern Letters, [[Victoria University of Wellington]]|date=13 March 2016|accessdate=10 April 2017}}</ref>

For her third play, ''Te Papakāinga'', Rakuraku again won the Adam award for best playwright. The play (which also served as Rakuraku's [[master's thesis]]) concerns the effect of a child's death on a Māori village struggling with the effects of colonisation.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[The Spinoff]]|url=https://thespinoff.co.nz/auckland/30-08-2017/im-not-a-victim-yo-playwright-maraea-rakuraku-on-the-power-of-maori-theatre/|title=‘I’m not a victim, yo!’ Playwright Maraea Rakuraku on the power of Māori theatre|first=Sam|last=Brooks|date=30 August 2017}}</ref>
