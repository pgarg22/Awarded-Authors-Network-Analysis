'''Archie Randolph Ammons''' (February 18, 1926 – February 25, 2001) was an American [[poet]] who won the annual [[National Book Award for Poetry]] in 1973 and 1993.<ref name=nba1973/><ref name=nba1993/>

==Poetic themes==

Ammons wrote about humanity's relationship to nature in alternately comic and solemn tones. His poetry often addresses religious and philosophical matters and scenes involving nature, almost in a Transcendental fashion. According to reviewer Daniel Hoffman, his work "is founded on an implied Emersonian division of experience into Nature and the Soul," <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poets/detail/a-r-ammons |title=A. R. Ammons |date=May 26, 2021 |publisher=Poetry Foundation |access-date=August 15, 2016<!-- orig source is NY Times Review, need that one -->}}</ref> adding that it "sometimes consciously echo[es] familiar lines from Emerson, Whitman and Dickinson."{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==Life==
Ammons grew up on a tobacco farm near [[Whiteville, North Carolina]], in the southeastern part of the state. He served as a sonar operator in the U.S. Navy during World War II, stationed on board the [[USS Gunason]], a destroyer escort.<ref>Gantt, Patricia (1992). "The A.R. Ammons Papers: Bits of Resistance Against Time."  ''North Carolina Literary Review 1: 164–165.''</ref> After the war, Ammons attended [[Wake Forest University]], majoring in biology. Graduating in 1949, he served as a principal and teacher at Hattaras Elementary School later that year and also married Phyllis Plumbo.<ref>Wilson, Emily Herring (October 2007).

In 1964, Ammons joined the faculty of [[Cornell University]], eventually becoming Goldwin Smith Professor of English and Poet in Residence. He retired from Cornell in 1998.<ref name="Lehman 2002">{{Cite book

Ammons had been a longtime resident of the [[South Jersey]] communities of [[Northfield, New Jersey|Northfield]], [[Ocean City, New Jersey|Ocean City]] and [[Millville, New Jersey|Millville]], when he wrote ''Corsons Inlet'' in 1962.<ref>Laymon, Rob.

==Awards==
During the five decades of his poetic career, Ammons was the recipient of many awards and citations. Among his major honors are the 1973 and 1993 U.S. [[National Book Award]]s (for ''Collected Poems, 1951-1971'' and for ''Garbage'');<ref name=nba1973/><ref name=nba1993/> the [[Wallace Stevens Award]] from the [[Academy of American Poets]] (1998); and a [[MacArthur Fellowship]] in 1981, the year the award was established.<ref name="Lehman 2002"/><ref>The A.

==Poetic style==

Ammons often writes in two- or three-line stanzas. Poet David Lehman notes a resemblance between Ammons's ''terza libre'' (unrhymed three-line stanzas) and the ''terza rima'' of [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley's]] "Ode to the West Wind." Lines are strongly [[enjambment|enjambed]].<ref name="Lehman 2006">{{cite journal |last=Lehman |first=David |year=2006 |title=Archie: A Profile of A.R. Ammons |journal=American Poet |url=http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15766 |access-date=August 27, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517022758/http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15766 |archive-date=May 17, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Some of Ammons's poems are very short, one or two lines only, a form known as [[monostich]] (effectively, including the title, a kind of [[couplet]]<ref>Hirsch, Edwatd ' A Poets Glossary' Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Boston 2014 {{ISBN|9780151011957}}</ref>), while others (for example, the book-length poems ''Sphere'' and ''Tape for the Turn of the Year'') are hundreds of lines long, and sometimes composed on adding-machine tape or other continuous strips of paper. His National Book Award-winning volume ''Garbage'' is a long poem consisting of "a single extended sentence, divided into eighteen sections, arranged in couplets".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.enotes.com/poetry-criticism/ammons-r |title=A.R. Ammons Criticism|access-date=August 27, 2008|publisher=eNotes.com}}</ref> Ammons's long poems tend to derive multiple strands from a single image.<ref>Lehman, David - Interview 'The Art of Poetry'  Paris Review no 73 Summer 1996</ref>

Many readers and critics have noted Ammons's idiosyncratic approach to punctuation. Lehman has written that Ammons "bears out [[T. S. Eliot|T. S. Eliot']]s observation that poetry is a 'system of punctuation'." Instead of periods, some poems end with an ellipsis; others have no terminal punctuation at all. The [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] is an Ammons "signature"; he uses it "as an all-purpose punctuation mark."
{{quote|
The colon permits him to stress the linkage between clauses and to postpone closure indefinitely.... When I asked Archie about his use of colons, he said that when he started writing poetry, he couldn't write if he thought "it was going to be important," so he wrote "on the back of used mimeographed paper my wife brought home, and I used small [lowercase] letters and colons, which were democratic, and meant that there would be something before and after [every phrase] and the writing would be a kind of continuous stream."<ref name="Lehman 2006"/>
}}

According to critic [[Stephanie Burt]], in many poems Ammons combines three types of [[diction]]:
{{quote|
* A "normal" range of language for poetry, including the standard English of educated conversation and the slightly rarer words we expect to see in literature ("vast," "summon," "universal").
* A demotic register, including the folk-speech of eastern North Carolina, where he grew up ("dibbles"), and broader American chatter unexpected in serious poems ("blip").
* The Greek- and Latin-derived phraseology of the natural sciences ("millimeter," "information of actions / summarized"), especially geology, physics, and cybernetics.
}}
Such a mixture is nearly unique, Burt says; these three modes are "almost never found together outside his poems".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bookcriticscircle.blogspot.com/2008/06/in-retrospect-stephen-burt-on-ar-ammons.html |title=In Retrospect: Stephen Burt on A.R. Ammons |access-date=August 27, 2008 |author=Stephen Burt |date=June 17, 2008 |publisher=National Book Critics Circle}}</ref>

In contrast, critic J. Mark Smith notes that in long poems such as ''Garbage'', with their "improvised, no-stopping, 'one-time event' compositional procedures," "Ammons works with a continuum of utterance whose central furrows are the most frequently repeated words and phrases in the contemporary American vulgate, but whose far outcastings register the faintest traces of anomalous use." That is, Ammons subjected his own poetic style and its relation to contemporary speech to considerable scrutiny. As Smith puts it, "Ammons's premise is that the process of sorting and grouping (or abstracting) that produces what we commonly call 'garbage' also powers the appearances, disappearances, and re-appearances of words."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Smith |first=J.
