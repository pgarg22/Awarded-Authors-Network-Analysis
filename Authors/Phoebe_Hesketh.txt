'''Phoebe Hesketh''' (29 January 1909 – 25 February 2005) was an English poet from Lancashire notable for her poems depicting nature.

==Life and writing==
Phoebe Hesketh was born in [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], [[Lancashire]]. Her father was the pioneer [[radiologist]] [[Arthur E. Rayner]]; her mother was a [[violin]]ist in the [[Hallé Orchestra]]. Among her aunts was the suffragette [[Edith Rigby]]. She was educated at [[Cheltenham Ladies' College]], but left at the age of 17 to care for her ill mother. She married Aubrey Hesketh, the director of a mill, in 1931 when she was 22 and they lived in [[Rivington]], Lancashire.<ref name= "Ind">{{cite news|last1=Harvey|first1=Anne|title=Phoebe Hesketh |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/phoebe-hesketh-13231.html|accessdate=31 March 2017|publisher=Independent|date=28 February 2005}}</ref><ref name="Guard">{{cite news|last1=Brownjohn|first1=Alan|title=Phoebe Hesketh |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/mar/03/guardianobituaries.books |accessdate=31 March 2017|publisher=The Guardian|date=3 March 2005}}</ref> Her first collection, ''Poems'', was published in 1939 by Sherratt & Hughes, Manchester, although she later disowned the work to some  extent.

During [[World War II]] Hesketh worked as the woman's page editor of the ''[[Bolton Evening News]]''. In 1948 she published her second volume of poetry, ''Lean Forward, Spring!'', (London: Sidgwick and Jackson), which earned her widespread acclaim amongst the literary community, including from [[Siegfried Sassoon]]. During her career she produced sixteen books and, although she never achieved popular success, was championed by several well-known figures including Sassoon, [[Roy Campbell (Poet)|Roy Campbell]], and [[Al Alvarez]].

After the war she was a freelance lecturer, poetry teacher and journalist, producing many articles for journals and scripts for the [[BBC]]. Her collected poems were gathered together in ''Netting the Sun: new and collected poems'' (Petersfield: Enitharmon Press, 1989). Her poetry for younger readers was published in ''A Song of Sunlight'' (Chatto, 1974) and in ''Six of the Best'' (Puffin, 1989). She was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Literature]] in 1956, and a Fellow of the [[University of Central Lancashire]] in 1990.

For almost all her life she lived in Lancashire, in a landscape frequently described in her poetry, and in her semi-autobiographical prose books ''Rivington: the story of a village'' (1972) and ''Village of the Mountain Ash'' (1990). From her marriage until she was widowed she lived at Rivington, and afterwards at [[Heath Charnock]]. She wrote a biography of her aunt [[Edith Rigby]] that was published in 1966. The Heskeths had three children. One of her poems describes the death of her young son. She then died on 25 February 2005.
