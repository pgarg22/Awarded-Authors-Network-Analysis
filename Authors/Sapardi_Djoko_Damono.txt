== Early life ==

Sapardi attended grammar school at Sekolah Dasar Kasatriyan in his home town of [[Surakarta]] (also known as Solo), and from there he went on to junior high and high school at SMP 2 and SMA 2.<ref name="On the record Sapardi">{{cite book | title = On the Record: Film Transcripts and Biographical Information. Volume 4 | publisher = Lontar Foundation | location = Jakarta | year = 2004 }}</ref> He was an avid reader from an early age, and was a frequent visitor to the local libraries around Solo.<ref name="On the record Sapardi" /> His interests were broad, ranging from the works of [[Karl May]], [[William Saroyan]], and [[Pramoedya Ananta Toer]], to comics by [[R.A. Kosasih]].<ref name="On the record Sapardi" /> Eventually Sapardi, together with one of his younger siblings, began a lending library in their neighbourhood.<ref name="On the record Sapardi" />

Sapardi began writing poetry while still in high school in Surakarta.<ref name="Sapardi">{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2005/09/04/sapardi039s-words-pull-new-generations.html|title=Sapardi's words pull in new generations|last=Mariani|first=Evi|date=4 September 2005|work=[[The Jakarta Post]]|accessdate=31 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130204111053/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2005/09/04/sapardi039s-words-pull-new-generations.html|archivedate=4 February 2013}}</ref> After his graduation from high school, Sapardi moved to [[Yogyakarta]] to study at the English division of the Literature department at [[Gajah Mada University]], and later completed his graduate studies in Indonesian literature.<ref name="On the record Sapardi" /> During this period he also became involved in radio broadcasting and the theater, as well as writing poetry.<ref name="On the record Sapardi" /> Sapardi's literary career developed alongside his academic career.

== Career ==

After graduating from UGM, Sapardi taught in a number of places, including [[Madiun]], Solo, and [[Diponegoro University]] in [[Semarang]], before moving to the [[United States]] for a brief period.<ref name="On the record Sapardi" /> In 1973, after his return from the US, he became a permanent faculty member in the Literature Department at the [[University of Indonesia]].<ref name="On the record Sapardi" /> In 1989 he received his doctorate from the same university, and in 1993 became a full professor.<ref name="On the record Sapardi" />

His first collection of poetry, ''DukaMu Abadi'' (Your Eternal Sorrow), was released in 1969.<ref name="Westward">{{cite book | last = Damono | first = Sapardi Djoko | title = Walking westward in the morning : seven contemporary Indonesian poets | publisher = Lontar Foundation in collaboration with SOAS | location = Jakarta | year = 1990 | isbn = 979-8083-03-2 }}</ref> The focus of ''DukaMu Abadi'' is on the pain of the individual who questions existence, and unlike many of his literary peers of this time, Sapardi's poetry focused more on the human condition rather than revolutionary and social ideas.<ref name="Thee" /> In 1974, he published ''Mata Pisau'' (Knife) and ''Akuarium'' (Aquarium).<ref name="Westward" /> These were followed by ''Perahu Kertas'' (Paper Boat) and ''Sihir Hujan'' (Rain Spell), and in 1986 he received the [[ASEAN]]-sponsored SEA-Write Award for poetry.<ref name="Westward" /> In 1987, he was one of several prominent Indonesian figures ([[Goenawan Mohamad]], [[Subagio Sastrowardoyo]], [[Umar Kayam]], and [[John H. McGlynn]]) involved in the establishment of the [[Lontar Foundation]].<ref name="JP 29082011">Dewi S. Syahrir. "Lontar Foundation promotes Indonesian literature". ''[[The Jakarta Post]]''. 29 August 1988.<!--- Page number?---></ref> To mark the foundation's inauguration, a collection of Sapardi's poems, entitled "Suddenly the Night" was released.<ref name="JP 29082011" /> In 1998/1999, Sapardi wrote about the social turbulence resulting from the fall of the [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]] regime. This resulted in the book ''Ayat-ayat Api'' (Verses of Fire), which received some negative criticism, largely due to the angry tone of the work which differed markedly from his normal style.<ref name="Sapardi" /> His best known works include ''Hujan Bulan Juni'' (A June Rain) and ''Berjalan ke Barat di Waktu Pagi Hari'' (Walking to the West in the Morning). ''Hujan Bulan Juni'', one of his most popular works, was published in 1994. Containing 95 poems, including a selection of his poems from 1964 to 1992, the book has been described as a kind of "greatest hits" of Sapardi.<ref name="Sapardi" /> Some of the poems included were written during a year spent at the [[University of Hawaiʻi|University of Hawaii]] in [[Honolulu]] in the early 1970s.<ref name="Sapardi" />

Sapardi has also completed a number of translations of literary works from other countries into Indonesian.<ref name="Djoko1111">{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/03/31/sapardi-djoko-damono-70-%E2%80%A6-and-still-kicking.html|title=Sapardi Djoko Damono: 70 ... and still kicking|last=Junaidi|first=Ahmad|date=31 March 2010|work=[[The Jakarta Post]]|accessdate=10 November 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403144300/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/03/31/sapardi-djoko-damono-70-%E2%80%A6-and-still-kicking.html|archivedate=3 April 2010}}</ref> These include the literary works of [[T.S. Eliot]], [[Khalil Gibran]] and Jalaludin [[Rumi]]; his translation of [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'' is considered among Indonesia's best.<ref name="Djoko1111" />

Sapardi's poems have also formed the inspiration behind several musical compositions, most notably by Indonesia's international-acclaimed pianist [[Ananda Sukarlan]].<ref name="Djoko1111" /> Several singers have also released albums using his poetry: ''Hujan Bulan Juni'' (1990), ''Hujan Dalam Komposisi'' (Rain in Composition) (1990) ''Gadis Kecil'' (Little Girl) (2006) and ''Becoming Dew'' (2007).<ref name="Djoko1111" /> In the realm of film, ''Aku Ingin'' has been rearranged into a soundtrack by musician Dwiki Dharmawan for [[Garin Nugroho]]'s 1991 film ''Cinta dalam Sepotong Roti'' (Love in A Slice of Bread).<ref name="Djoko1111" />

He was a professor at the [[University of Indonesia]].<ref name="Djoko1110">{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/11/08/performances-honor-master039s-plays-poetry.html|title=Performances honor master's plays, poetry|last=Kurniasari|first=Triwik|date=8 November 2009|work=[[The Jakarta Post]]|accessdate=10 November 2011}}</ref> Damono's extensive and intensive involvement in the university has borne him the unofficial title 'Professor of Indonesian Poets'.<ref>[[Bakdi Soemanto]]{{Citation | author1=Soemanto, Bakdi | title=Sapardi Djoko Damono : karya dan dunianya | publication-date=2006 | publisher=Grasindo | isbn=978-979-759-447-3 }}</ref> He was once elected [[Dean (education)|dean]] of the [[faculty (division)|faculty]].
