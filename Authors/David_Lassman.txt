"'''Rejecting Jane'''" is the title of a 2007 article by British author David Lassman.<ref name="thisissomerset.co.uk">[http://www.thisissomerset.co.uk/blanksearch/Crazy-Jane-film-premiere-Austen-festival-Bath/article-335740-detail/article.html "Crazy for Jane film premiere at Austen festival in Bath"] Retrieved 1 April 2009</ref><ref>'How literary hoax turned into a global story for Austen fans'.

==The idea==
Using the pseudonym 'Alison Laydee'&nbsp;– a play on Austen's original ''[[nom de plume]]'' "A Lady"<ref name=Bruxelles/>&nbsp;– Lassman sent out the opening chapters of ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'', ''[[Northanger Abbey]]'' and ''[[Persuasion (novel)|Persuasion]]'' to several major publishers and literary agents, with different titles but only minor changes to the text, such as character names and locations. The resultant article discussed how all but one of the publishers and agents failed to recognise her works, including [[Penguin Books]] and [[J. K. Rowling]]'s publisher [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]], with the vast majority rejecting the attempt to gain a publishing deal. This was also despite ''Pride and Prejudice''{{'s}} opening line "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife" was left intact.<ref name=Bruxelles/>
