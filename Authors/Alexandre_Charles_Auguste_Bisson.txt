'''Alexandre Bisson''' (9 April 1848 – 27 January 1912) was a French [[playwright]], [[vaudeville]] creator, and novelist. Born in [[Briouze]], Orne in [[Basse-Normandie|Lower Normandy]], he was successful in his native France as well as in the United States.  Remembered as a significant creator of Parisian vaudeville, in collaboration with [[Edmond Gondinet]], Bisson's 1881 three-act comedy ''Un Voyage d'agrément'' was performed at the [[Théâtre du Vaudeville]] in Paris.

Of his works, Bisson is best remembered for his play ''Madame X'', which was performed in 1910 both in Paris and on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] with [[Sarah Bernhardt]] in the leading role. Over the years, the play would be revived for Broadway three times and nine ''[[Madame X]]'' motion pictures in several languages have been filmed. The first [[silent film|silent screen]] adaptation was in 1916 and the latest in 2000. Better-known versions include a 1929 [[talkie|sound]] film starring [[Ruth Chatterton]] and directed by [[Lionel Barrymore]] plus the 1966 film starring [[Lana Turner]]. In 2006, a musical based on the original play was produced in Chicago.

Bisson also adapted the 1910 best-selling [[Florence Barclay]] novel, ''[[The Rosary (novel)|The Rosary]]'' as a three-act play for the Paris stage. Widely acclaimed in the United States, Alexandre Bisson was invited to write about the theatre by ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' and his articles "The Dilemmas of the Theater" and "How the World Contributes to the American Stage" were published in 1912.

Alexandre Bisson died in Paris in 1912 at the age of 63.
