'''Alan John Ross''' (6 May 1922 – 14 February 2001) was a [[Great Britain|British]] poet, writer, editor and publisher.

== Early years ==
Ross was born in [[Calcutta]], [[British Raj|India]], where he spent the first seven years of his life. When he was sent to be educated in [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]], England, he spoke better [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] than [[English language|English]]. Following [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory school]], he boarded at [[Haileybury and Imperial Service College|Haileybury]] where, being both small for his age and a latecomer to his year, he initially suffered greatly from bullying – to his intense relief, the bully was killed in a cycling accident whilst on holiday – but his stock quickly rose when he revealed a talent which matched his passion for cricket. With a hint of the debonair style that was to characterise his life, Ross avoided participation in the [[Officers' Training Corps|OTC]] and all study of mathematics and science, instead enjoying art, French poetry and racquet sports. As a senior boy he was caned for making an unlicensed visit to [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]]; it was his misfortune that he figured, smoking a cigarette, in a photograph of spectators carried in his headmaster's newspaper the following morning.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ross |first=Alan |title=Blindfold Games |publisher=Collins Harvill |location=London |year=1986 |pages=96–111}}</ref>

In 1940 he went to read Modern Languages at [[St John's College, Oxford|St John's College]], Oxford, where he was a contemporary of [[Philip Larkin]] and [[Kingsley Amis]]. Ross represented the university at both [[cricket]] and [[Squash (sport)|squash]] but did not complete his studies after joining the [[Royal Navy]] in 1941. Before doing so, he appeared in the annual [[The University Match (cricket)|match against Cambridge]] at [[Lord's]] in 1941, but because of the [[Second World War]] the fixture was reduced to a single day and did not have [[first-class cricket|first-class]] status.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Home of CricketArchive|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/136/136385.html|access-date=2021-11-15|website=cricketarchive.com}}</ref> In the same season he appeared in one one-day match for [[Northamptonshire County Cricket Club|Northamptonshire]].

== Naval career ==
During his first two years in the Royal Navy, Ross served on several [[destroyer]]s escorting supply ships to the [[Soviet Union]]. On 30 December 1942 he was almost killed whilst serving aboard {{HMS|Onslow|G17}}, the leading destroyer in a convoy assigned to fend off a strong flotilla of German capital ships intent on annihilating the arctic [[convoy JW 51B]], at the [[Battle of the Barents Sea]]. He was ordered to take a turn controlling a fire below in the forward part of the ship and, to save the main body of the ship in the event of an explosion, sealed in for half an hour with a hose, armpit-deep in water, the bodies of two gun crews washing against him. The incident is vividly described in both his poem "J.W.51B a convoy" and his first volume of memoirs.<ref>{{cite book |title=Blindfold Games |pages=161–200}}</ref>

== Journalistic career ==
After he was demobilised in 1946 Ross decided not to resume his studies at Oxford, but instead to try his hand at journalism. In 1946 his first poetry collection ''The Derelict Day'' was published; it contained poems he had written whilst in the Navy. The following year the publisher [[John Lehmann]] funded him and the artist [[John Minton (artist)|John Minton]] to travel to [[Corsica]] to produce the travel book ''Time Was Away''.

Ross became a sports writer for ''[[The Observer]]'' in 1950, and became the paper's cricket correspondent in 1953, the same year his son was born. Throughout the 1950s he was a regular contributor to Lehmann's ''[[The London Magazine]]'', before taking over as the title's editor in 1961. He edited the monthly magazine under the trimmed title ''London Magazine'' until his death; during this period it was transformed from an academic literary review to a far more cutting-edge review of the arts.

== Poetry ==
Ross came to prominence as a poet with poems inspired by his experience during the Second World War. He was one of the few poets who wrote poems in English about naval warfare during that war.<ref>http://www.warpoets.org/?s=alan+ross&x=GO Retrieved 16 May 2017</ref>

==Personal life==
In 1949 Ross married [[Jennifer Ross|Jennifer Fry]], the only child of [[Sir Geoffrey Fry, 1st Baronet]], of the Fry family who founded the chocolate company.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1452032/Jennifer-Ross.html|title = Jennifer Ross}}</ref>
