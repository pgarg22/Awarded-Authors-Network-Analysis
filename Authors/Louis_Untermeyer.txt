'''Louis Untermeyer''' (October 1, 1885 – December 18, 1977) was an American poet, anthologist, critic,<ref>See for example his criticism of Wallace Stevens's [[Harmonium (poetry collection)|Harmonium]], including such poems as [[Frogs Eat Butterflies. Snakes Eat Frogs. Hogs Eat Snakes. Men Eat Hogs]].</ref> and editor. He was appointed the fourteenth [[Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress]] in 1961.<ref>{{cite web | title=Poet Laureate Timeline: 1961-1970 | url=https://www.loc.gov/poetry/laureate-1961-1970.html | publisher=Library of Congress | year=2008 | access-date=2008-12-19}}</ref>

==Life and career==
Untermeyer was born in [[New York City]], the son of a German-Jewish jewelry manufacturer.<ref name="Liptzin">{{cite EJ|last=Liptzin|first=Sol|title=Untermeyer, Louis|volume=20|page=418}}</ref> He initially joined his father's firm as a designer, rising to the rank of vice president, before resigning from the firm in 1923 to devote himself to literary pursuits.<ref name="Liptzin"/> He was, for the most part, self-educated.<ref name="Liptzin"/>

He married [[Jean Starr Untermeyer|Jean Starr]] in January 1907, and their son Richard was born in December of that year.<ref name="Tillona">Tillona, Francesca (March 20, 2009). "[http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/untermeyer-jean-starr  Jean Starr Untermeyer]." ''Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia''. Jewish Women's Archive. www.jwa.org. Retrieved 2016-07-05.</ref> (Richard Untermeyer committed suicide in 1927, at the age of 19.<ref name="Tillona"/>) After a 1926 divorce, they were reunited in 1929, after which they adopted two sons, Laurence and Joseph. He married the poet Virginia Moore (1903–1993) in 1927; their son, John Moore Untermeyer (1928), was renamed [[John Fitzallen Moore]] after a painful 1929 divorce. In the 1930s, he divorced Jean Starr Untermeyer and married [[Esther Antin Untermeyer|Esther Antin]] (1894–1983). This relationship also ended in divorce in 1945.<ref>{{cite news | author=Staff writers | title=Esther Untermeyer, 88; A Zionist and Ex-Judge | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B01E1D61238F93BA35752C0A965948260 | work=The New York Times | date=8 January 1983 | access-date=2008-12-21}}</ref> In 1948, he married Bryna Ivens, an editor of ''[[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen]]'' magazine.

Untermeyer's first book of poetry, ''First Love'' (1911), reflected the influences of [[Heinrich Heine]] and British poet [[Laurence Housman]].<ref name="Liptzin"/> His next collection, '' Challenge'' (1914), showed his growing maturity as a poet.<ref name="Liptzin"/>

Untermeyer was known for his wit and his love of puns.  For a while, he held [[Marxism|Marxist]] beliefs, writing for magazines such as ''[[The Masses]]'', through which he advocated that the United States stay out of [[World War I]].  After the suppression of that magazine by the [[United States Government|U.S. government]], he joined [[The Liberator (magazine)|''The Liberator'']], published by the [[Workers Party of America]].  Later he wrote for the independent [[socialism|socialist]] magazine ''[[The New Masses]]''. He was a co-founder, in 1916, of ''[[The Seven Arts]]'',<ref>"Louis Untermeyer." ''Dictionary of American Biography''. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1995. Accessed via ''Biography in Context'' database, 2016-07-05.</ref> a poetry magazine that is credited for introducing many new poets, including [[Robert Frost]], who became Untermeyer's long-term friend and correspondent.

On May 1, 1935, Untermeyer joined the [[League of American Writers]] (1935–1943), whose members included [[Lillian Hellman]], [[Dashiell Hammett]], [[Frank Folsom]], [[Alexander Trachtenberg]], [[I.F. Stone]], [[Myra Page]], [[Millen Brand]], and [[Arthur Miller]].  (Members were largely either Communist Party members or [[fellow travelers]].)<ref name=Looper>

In 1950, Untermeyer was a panelist during the first year of the ''[[What's My Line?]]'' television quiz program. According to [[Bennett Cerf]], Untermeyer would sign virtually any piece of paper that someone placed in front of him, and Untermeyer inadvertently signed a few Communist proclamations.<ref name=transcript>{{cite interview | subject=Bennett Cerf | interviewer=Robert Hawkins | title=Interview #16, pp. 732-733 | url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/digital/collections/nny/cerfb/transcripts/cerfb_1_16_710.html | type=Interview: audio/transcript | work=Columbia University Libraries Oral History Research Office | date=23 January 1968 | access-date=2008-12-21}}</ref>  According to Cerf, Untermeyer was not at all a communist, but he had joined several suspect societies that made him stand out.<ref name=transcript/>  He was named during the hearings by the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]] investigating communist subversion.  The [[Catholic War Veterans]] and right-wing organizations began hounding Untermeyer. [[Goodson-Todman]], producer of the show, did not act on the protests against Untermeyer for some time, but finally war veterans began picketing outside the New York City television studio from which ''What's My Line?'' was telecast live.  The pressure became too great, and the sponsor [[Jules Montenier]], inventor of Stopette [[deodorant]], said, "After all, I'm paying a lot of money for this. I can't afford to have my product picketed."<ref name=transcript/>

At that point, the producers told Untermeyer that he had to leave the television series. The last live telecast on which he appeared was on March 11, 1951, and the mystery guest he questioned while blindfolded was [[Celeste Holm]].<ref>[http://www.tv.com/shows/whats-my-line/episode-41-92669/ page from tv.com with Suzanne Astorino's notation of a destroyed kinescope that she obtained from ''What's My Line?'' producer Gil Fates who had recorded the information]</ref> The [[kinescope]] of this episode has been lost.<ref>[http://www.tv.com/shows/whats-my-line/episode-41-92669/ page from tv.com with Suzanne Astorino's notation of a destroyed kinescope that she obtained from What's My Line producer Gil Fates who had recorded the information]</ref> His exit led to [[Bennett Cerf]] becoming a permanent member of the program.<ref name=transcript/>

The controversy surrounding Untermeyer led to him being [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]] by the television industry. According to Untermeyer's friend [[Arthur Miller]], Untermeyer became so depressed by his forced departure from ''What's My Line?'' that he refused to leave his home in [[Brooklyn]] for more than a year,<ref name="Miller 1987 262–4">{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Arthur|title=Timebends: A Life|publisher=Grove Atlantic, Inc.|year=1987|pages=[https://archive.org/details/timebendslife00mill_1/page/262 262]–4|isbn=9780802100153|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/timebendslife00mill_1}}</ref> and his wife Bryna answered all incoming phone calls.<ref name="Miller 1987 262–4"/>  It was she who eventually told Miller what had happened because Untermeyer would not pick up the phone to talk to him,<ref name="Miller 1987 262–4"/> even though Miller's support of blacklisted writers and radio and television personalities was well-known to Untermeyer and many others.<ref name="Miller 1987 262–4"/> But for more than a year, whenever Miller dialed the Untermeyers' phone number, Bryna "talked obscurely about [her husband Louis] not wanting phone conversations anymore, preferring to wait until we could all get together again," wrote Miller.<ref name="Miller 1987 262–4"/>

Miller was a "very infrequent television watcher" in 1951, according to words he used in his 1987 autobiography,<ref name="Miller 1987 262–4"/> and so he did not notice that Bennett Cerf had replaced Untermeyer on the live TV game show.<ref name="Miller 1987 262–4"/> Miller did read New York City newspapers every day, but apparently there was no published report of Untermeyer's disappearance from television,<ref name="Miller 1987 262–4"/> so Miller was unaware that anything was wrong until Untermeyer's wife Bryna eventually revealed what the problem was, after they had conversed by phone for more than a year.<ref name="Miller 1987 262–4"/>

Louis Untermeyer was the author or editor of close to 100 books, from 1911 until his death.  Many of them and his other memorabilia are preserved in a special section of the [[Lilly Library]] at [[Indiana University]]. Schools used his Modern American and British poetry books widely, and they often introduced college students to poetry. He and Bryna Ivens Untermeyer created a number of books for young people, under the Golden Treasury of Children's Literature. Untermeyer also rounded up contributors for a Modern Masters for Children series published by Crowell-Collier Press in the 1960s—the books were designed to have a vocabulary of 800 words and contributors included [[Robert Graves]], [[Phyllis McGinley|Phylis McGinley]], and [[Shirley Jackson]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1962/09/30/issue.html|title=The New York Times: Sunday September 30, 1962|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=2016-04-23}}</ref> He lectured on literature for many years, both in the US and other countries. In 1956 the [[Poetry Society of America]] awarded Untermeyer a Gold Medal. He also served as the [[Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress]] from 1961 until 1963.
