===Other work===
Delaney's second play ''[[The Lion In Love (play)|The Lion in Love]]'' followed in 1960. The ''Encyclopedia of British Writers: 19th and 20th Centuries'' comments that it "portrays an impoverished family, whose income comes from peddling trinkets", but "the best qualities of the first play are absent."<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Stade|editor1-first=George|editor2-last=Karbiener|editor2-first=Karen|editor3-last=Krueger|editor3-first=Christine L.|title=Encyclopedia of British Writers: 19th and 20th Centuries|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediabrit00krue|url-access=limited|location=New York City|publisher=Facts on File|year=2003|page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediabrit00krue/page/n123 104]}}</ref> The novelist [[Jeanette Winterson]], though, has commented that the contemporary reviews of these first two plays' first performances "read like a depressing essay in sexism".<ref name="Winterson">{{cite news|last=Winterson|first=Jeanette|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/sep/18/jeanette-winterson-my-hero-shelagh-delaney|title=My hero: Shelagh Delaney by Jeanette Winterson|work=The Guardian|date=18 September 2010}} See also the article by [https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2003/sep/10/theatre2 Samantha Ellis]</ref> ''Sweetly Sings the Donkey'', a collection of short stories, appeared in 1963.

''A Taste of Honey'' was adapted into a [[A Taste of Honey (film)|film of the same title]], released in 1961 with Delaney as an extra in the opening netball scene. Delaney wrote the screenplay with the director, [[Tony Richardson]]. According to Phil Wickham, writing for the  ''[[Screenonline]]'' website, the film script "contrives to keep in Delaney's best lines while creating a cinematic rather than a theatrical experience".<ref>{{cite web|last=Wickham|first=Phil|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/439975/|title=''Taste of Honey, A'' (1961)|work=BFI Screenonline|date=2003–2014|access-date=3 October 2019}}</ref> It won the [[BAFTA Award]] for Best British Screenplay and the Writers' Guild of Great Britain Award in 1962.

==Legacy==
In 1986, [[the Smiths]]' lead singer and lyricist [[Morrissey]] said: "I've never made any secret of the fact that at least 50 percent of my reason for writing can be blamed on Shelagh Delaney". The lyrics of "[[This Night Has Opened My Eyes]]" are a retelling of the plot of ''A Taste of Honey'', using many direct quotations from the play. Morrissey chose a photo of Delaney as the artwork on the album cover for [[the Smiths]]' 1987 compilation album ''[[Louder Than Bombs]]'' as well as the single "[[Girlfriend in a Coma (song)|Girlfriend in a Coma]]".<ref>{{cite book|last=Goddard|first=Simon|title=Mozipedia: The Encyclopedia of Morrissey and the Smiths|publisher=Plume Books|year=2010|pages=[https://archive.org/details/mozipediaencyclo00godd_0/page/96 96–99]|isbn=978-0-45-229667-1|url=https://archive.org/details/mozipediaencyclo00godd_0/page/96}}</ref>
