'''Charlotte Smith''' (née '''Turner'''; {{Birth date|1749|5|4|df=y}} – {{Death date|1806|10|28|df=y}}), an English novelist and poet of the [[Romanticism|Romantic period]], prompted a revival of [[Sonnet#19th century|the English sonnet]],<ref>''Elegaic Sonnets'', 1784.</ref> helped to set conventions for [[Gothic fiction]] and wrote political [[Sensibility|novels of sensibility]]. Despite ten novels, four children's books and other works, she saw herself mainly as a poet, expecting to be remembered for her ''[[Elegiac Sonnets]]''.{{sfn|Roberts|2019|p=152}} She is credited with turning the sonnet into an expression of woeful sentiment.{{sfn |Abrams |Greenblatt |Christ |David |2012 |p=53}} She left her husband and began writing to support their children. Her struggles for legal independence as a woman gave themes to her poetry, novels, and autobiographic prefaces. Her early novels show development in the Gothic and [[Sentimentalism (philosophy)|sentimentality]]. Later ones such as the controversial [[Desmond (novel)|''Desmond'']] and ''[[The Old Manor House]]'' praised the ideals of the [[French Revolution]]. Waning interest left her destitute by 1803. Barely able to hold a pen, she sold her book collection to pay debts and died in 1806. Largely forgotten by the mid-19th century, she has since been seen as a major Romantic writer.

==Early life==
Charlotte Turner was born on 4 May 1749 in London and baptised on 12 June; she was the oldest child of well-to-do Nicholas Turner and Anna Towers. Her two younger siblings, Nicholas and [[Catherine Ann Dorset|Catherine Ann]], were born within the next five years.{{sfn|Zimmerman|2007}} Smith received a typical education for a girl in a wealthy family during the late 18th century. Smith's childhood was shaped by her mother's early death (probably in giving birth to Catherine) and her father's reckless spending.{{sfn|Blank|2003}} After losing his wife, Nicholas Turner travelled and the children were raised by Lucy Towers, their maternal aunt; when exactly their father returned is unknown.{{sfn|Zimmerman|2007}}

At the age of six, Charlotte went to school in [[Chichester]] and took drawing lessons from the painter [[George Smith (artist)|George Smith]]. Two years later, she, her aunt, and her sister moved to London and she attended a girls' school in [[Kensington]], where she learned dancing, drawing, music, and acting. She loved to read and wrote poems, which her father encouraged. She even submitted a few to the ''[[Lady's Magazine]]'' for publication, but they were not accepted.{{sfn|Zimmerman|2007}}

==Marriage and first publication==
[[File:SmithElegiacSonnetsTitle.png|right|thumb|Smith signed herself "Charlotte Smith of [[Bignor Park]]" on the title page of ''Elegiac Sonnets'', claiming the role of [[gentlewoman]].{{sfn|Zimmerman|2007}}]]
Nicholas Turner encountered financial difficulties on his return to England and was forced to sell some of the family's holdings and marry the wealthy Henrietta Meriton in 1765. His daughter entered society at the age of 12, leaving school and being tutored at home. His reckless spending then forced her to [[child marriage|marry early]]. In a marriage that she later described as prostitution, she was given by her father to a violent and profligate man. On 23 February 1765, at the age of 15, she married Benjamin Smith, the son of [[Richard Smith (merchant)|Richard Smith]], a wealthy [[London Society of West India Planters and Merchants|West Indian merchant]] and a director of the [[East India Company]]. [[Arranged marriage|The proposal was accepted]] for her by her father;{{sfn |Zimmerman |2007}} forty years later, Smith condemned her father's action, which she wrote had turned her into a "legal prostitute".{{sfn |Blank |2003}}

The Smiths had twelve children. In 1766, Charlotte and Benjamin had their first child, who died the next year just days after the birth of their second, Benjamin Berney (1767–1777).{{efn-ua |name=berney |1=Benjamin's sister Mary was married twice. Her first husband's family name was 'Berney'. Her second husband's family name was 'Dyer'.}} Between 1767 and 1785, the couple had ten more children: William Towers (b.1768), Charlotte Mary (b.1769), Braithwaite (b. 1770), [[Nicholas Hankey Smith|Nicholas Hankey]] (1771–1837), Charles Dyer (b.1773),{{efn-ua |name=berney}} Anna Augusta (1774–94), Lucy Eleanor (b. 1776), [[Sir Lionel Smith, 1st Baronet|Lionel]] (1778–1842), Harriet (b.{{circa|1782|lk=no}}), and George (b.{{circa|1785|lk=no}}). Six of Smith's children survived her.{{sfn|Zimmerman|2007}}

The Smith marriage was unhappy. She detested living in commercial [[Cheapside]] (the family later moved to [[Southgate, London|Southgate]] and [[Tottenham]]) and argued with her in-laws, whom she saw as unrefined and uneducated. They in turn mocked her for spending time reading, writing, and drawing. Even worse, Benjamin proved to be violent, unfaithful and profligate. Only her father-in-law, Richard, appreciated her writing abilities, although he wanted her to use them to further his business interests.{{sfn |Blank |2003}} Richard Smith owned [[List of plantations in Barbados|plantations in Barbados]] and he and his second wife brought five slaves to England, who, along with their descendants, were included as part of the family property in his will. Although Charlotte Smith later [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|argued against slavery]] in works such as ''[[The Old Manor House]]'' (1793) and ''Beachy Head'', she herself benefited from the income and slave labour of Richard Smith's plantations,{{sfn |Zimmerman |2007}} and assisted in the family business that her husband had abandoned by helping Richard Smith with his correspondence.

She persuaded Richard to set Benjamin up as a [[Gentleman's farm|gentleman farmer]] in [[Hampshire]] and lived with him at Lys Farm,<ref>[https://www.krishnamurticentre.org.uk/centre/grounds.php.]</ref> [[Bramdean]], about 10 miles east of Winchester, from 1774 until 1783.{{sfn |Zimmerman |2007}} Worried about Charlotte's future and that of his grandchildren and concerned that his son would continue his irresponsible ways, Richard Smith willed the majority of his property to Charlotte's children. However, because he had drawn up the will himself, the documents contained legal problems. The inheritance, originally worth nearly £36,000, was tied up in [[Court of chancery|chancery]] after his death in 1776 for almost 40 years. Smith and her children saw little of it.{{sfn |Zimmerman |2007}} (It has been proposed that this may have inspired the famous fictional case of interminable legal proceedings, [[Jarndyce and Jarndyce]], in Dickens's ''[[Bleak House]]''.{{sfn |Labbe |2002 |loc= Introduction p. 17, note 3}}

In fact, Benjamin illegally spent at least a third of the legacy and ended up in [[King's Bench Prison]], a [[debtor's prison]], in December 1783. Smith moved in with him and it was in this environment that she wrote and published her first work.{{sfn |Blank |2003}} ''[[Elegiac Sonnets]]'' (1784) achieved instant success, allowing Charlotte to pay for their release from prison. Smith's [[sonnet]]s helped initiate a revival of the form and granted an aura of respectability to her later novels, as poetry was then considered the highest art form. Smith revised ''Elegiac Poems'' several times over the years, eventually creating a two-volume work.{{sfn |Blank |2003}}

==Novelist and poet==
[[File:CharlotteSmithManuscript.jpg|thumb|left|Smith believed that her poetry, not her novels, granted her respectability.]]
Smith's husband fled to France to escape his creditors. She joined him there, until, thanks largely to her, he was able to return to England.

After Benjamin Smith was released from prison, the entire family moved to [[Dieppe, France]] to avoid further creditors. Charlotte returned to negotiate with them, but failed to come to an agreement. She went back to France and in 1784 began translating works from French into English. In 1787 she published ''[[The Romance of Real Life]]'', consisting of translated selections from [[François Gayot de Pitaval]]'s trials. She was forced to withdraw her other translation, ''[[Manon Lescaut]]'', after it was argued that the work was immoral and plagiarised. In 1786, she published it anonymously.{{sfn |Zimmerman |2007}}

In 1785, the family returned to England and moved to [[Woolbeding House]] near [[Midhurst]], [[Sussex]].{{sfn|Zimmerman|2007}} Smith's relationship with her husband did not improve and on 15 April 1787, after twenty-two years of marriage, she left him. She wrote that she might "have been contented to reside in the same house with him", had not "his temper been so capricious and often so cruel" that her "life was not safe".{{sfn|Blank|2003}} When Charlotte left Benjamin, she did not secure a legal agreement to protect her profits – he would have access to them under English [[primogeniture]] laws.{{sfn |Zimmerman |2007}} Smith knew that her children's future rested on a successful settlement of the lawsuit over her father-in-law's will, and so made every effort to earn enough money to fund the suit and retain the family's genteel status.{{sfn |Blank |2003}}

Smith claimed the position of gentlewoman, signing herself "Charlotte Smith of Bignor Park" on the title page of ''Elegiac Sonnets''.{{sfn |Zimmerman |2007}} All of her works were published under her own name, "a daring decision" for a woman at the time. Her success as a poet allowed her to make this choice.{{sfn |Zimmerman |2007}} Throughout her career, Smith identified herself as a poet. Although she published far more prose than poetry and her novels brought her more money and fame, she believed poetry would bring her respectability. As Sarah Zimmerman claimed in the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', "She prized her verse for the role it gave her as a private woman whose sorrows were submitted only reluctantly to the public."{{sfn |Zimmerman |2007}}

After separating from her husband, Smith moved to a town near Chichester and decided to write novels, as they would make more money than poetry. Her first novel, ''[[Emmeline]]'' (1788), was a success, selling 1500 copies within months. She wrote nine more in the next ten years: ''[[Ethelinde]]'' (1789), ''[[Celestina (novel)|Celestina]]'' (1791), ''[[Desmond (novel)|Desmond]]'' (1792), ''[[The Old Manor House]]'' (1793), ''[[The Wanderings of Warwick]]'' (1794), ''[[The Banished Man]]'' (1794), ''[[Montalbert (novel)|Montalbert]]'' (1795), ''[[Marchmont (novel)|Marchmont]]'' (1796), and ''[[The Young Philosopher]]'' (1798). Smith began her career as a novelist in the 1780s, at a time when women's fiction was expected to focus on romance and to foreground "a chaste and flawless heroine subjected to repeated melodramatic distresses until reinstated in society by the virtuous hero".{{sfn |Blank |2003}} Although Smith's novels employed this structure, they also incorporated political commentary, particularly support of the [[French Revolution]], through the voices of male characters. At times, she challenged the typical romance plot by including "narratives of female desire" or "tales of females suffering despotism".{{sfn |Blank |2003}} Smith's novels contributed to the development of [[Gothic fiction]] and the novel of [[sensibility]].{{sfn |Zimmerman |2007}}

Smith's novels include [[autobiographical]] characters and events. While a common device at the time, Antje Blank writes in ''[[The Literary Encyclopedia]]'', "few exploited fiction's potential of self-representation with such determination as Smith".{{sfn |Blank |2003}} For example, Mr and Mrs Stafford in ''Emmeline'' are portraits of Charlotte and Benjamin.{{sfn |Zimmerman |2007}} She suffered sorely throughout her life. Her mother died in childbirth when Charlotte was three. Charlotte's own first child died a day after her second child, Benjamin Berney, was born and Benjamin Berney lived only ten years. The prefaces to Smith's novels told the story of her own struggles, including the deaths of several of her children. According to Zimmerman, "Smith mourned most publicly for her daughter Anna Augusta, who married an émigré...and died aged twenty in 1795."{{sfn |Zimmerman |2007}} Smith's prefaces positioned her as both a suffering sentimental heroine and a vocal critic of the laws that kept her and her children in poverty.{{sfn |Blank |2003}}

[[File:SmithYoungPhilosopherTitle.png|right|thumb|''The Young Philosopher'' was Smith's last novel and a piece of "outspoken radical fiction".{{sfn|Blank|2003}}]]
Smith's experiences prompted her to argue for legal reforms that would grant women more rights, making the case for these through her novels. Her stories showed the "legal, economic, and sexual exploitation" of women by marriage and property laws. Initially readers were swayed by her arguments and writers such as [[William Cowper]] patronised her. However, as years passed, readers became exhausted by Smith's stories of struggle and inequality. Public opinion shifted towards the view of the poet [[Anna Seward]], who argued that Smith was "vain" and "indelicate" for exposing her husband to "public contempt".{{sfn|Blank|2003}}

Smith moved frequently due to financial concerns and declining health. During the last 20 years of her life, she lived in: Chichester, [[Brighton]], [[Storrington]], [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[Exmouth]], [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]], [[Oxford]], London, [[Frant]], and [[Elstead]]. She eventually settled at [[Tilford]], [[Surrey]].{{sfn |Zimmerman |2007}}

Smith became involved with English [[Radicalism (historical)|radicals]] while living in Brighton from 1791 to 1793. Like them, she supported the French Revolution and its [[Republicanism|republican]] principles. Her [[epistolary novel]] ''Desmond'' tells of a man journeying to revolutionary France and convinced of the rightness of the revolution. He contends that England should be reformed as well. The novel was published in June 1792, a year before [[French Revolutionary Wars|France and Britain went to war]] and before the [[Reign of Terror]] began, which shocked the British public, turning them against the revolutionaries.{{sfn |Zimmerman |2007}} Like many radicals, Smith criticised the French, but still endorsed the original ideals of the revolution.{{sfn |Zimmerman |2007}} To support her family, Smith had to sell her works, and so was eventually forced, as Blank claims, to "tone down the radicalism that had characterised the authorial voice in ''Desmond'' and adopt more oblique techniques to express her libertarian ideals".{{sfn |Blank |2003}} She set her next novel, ''The Old Manor House'' (1793), during the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]], which allowed her to discuss democratic reform without directly addressing the French situation. However, in her last novel, ''The Young Philosopher'' (1798), Smith wrote a final piece of "outspoken radical fiction".{{sfn |Blank |2003}} Her protagonist leaves Britain for America, as there is no hope for reform in Britain.

''The Old Manor House'' is "frequently deemed [Smith's] best" novel for its sentimental themes and development of minor characters. Novelist [[Walter Scott]] labeled it as such, and poet and critic [[Anna Laetitia Barbauld]] chose it for her anthology of ''The British Novelists'' (1810).{{sfn|Zimmerman|2007}} As a successful novelist and poet, Smith communicated with famous artists and thinkers of the day, including musician [[Charles Burney]] (father of [[Frances Burney]]), poet [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], scientist and poet [[Erasmus Darwin]], lawyer and radical [[Thomas Erskine, 1st Baron Erskine|Thomas Erskine]], novelist [[Mary Hays]], playwright [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]], and poet [[Robert Southey]].{{sfn |Zimmerman |2007}} A wide array of periodicals reviewed her works, including the ''[[Anti-Jacobin Review]]'', the ''[[Analytical Review]]'', the ''[[British Critic]]'', ''[[The Critical Review]]'', the ''[[European Magazine]]'', the ''[[Gentleman's Magazine]]'', the ''[[Monthly Magazine]]'', and the ''[[The Universal Magazine of Knowledge and Pleasure|Universal Magazine]]''.{{sfn |Zimmerman |2007}}

Smith earned the most money between 1787 and 1798, after which she was no longer as popular; several reasons have been suggested for the public's declining interest in Smith, including "a corresponding erosion of the quality of her work after so many years of literary labour, an eventual waning of readerly interest as she published, on average, one work per year for twenty-two years, and a controversy that attached to her public profile" as she wrote about the French Revolution.{{sfn |Zimmerman |2007}} Both radical and conservative periodicals criticized her novels about the revolution. Her insistence on pursuing the lawsuit over Richard Smith's inheritance lost her several patrons. Also, her increasingly blunt prefaces made her less appealing.{{sfn |Zimmerman |2007}}

To continue earning money, Smith began writing in less politically charged genres.{{sfn |Blank |2003}} She published a collection of tales, ''Letters of a Solitary Wanderer'' (1801–1802) and the play ''What Is She?'' (1799, attributed). Her most successful new foray was into children's literature: ''[[Rural Walks]]'' (1795), ''[[Rambles Farther]]'' (1796), ''[[Minor Morals]]'' (1798), and ''[[Conversations Introducing Poetry]]'' (1804). She also wrote two volumes of a history of England (1806) and ''A Natural History of Birds'' (1807, posthumous). She returned to writing poetry: ''[[Beachy Head and Other Poems]]'' (1807) was published posthumously.{{sfn|Zimmerman|2007}} Publishers did not pay as much for these works, however, and by 1803, Smith was poverty-stricken. She could barely afford food and had no coal. She even sold her beloved library of 500 books in order to pay off debts, but feared being sent to jail for the remaining £20.{{sfn |Blank |2003}}

==Illness and death==
Smith complained of [[gout]] for many years (it was probably [[rheumatoid arthritis]]), which made it increasingly difficult and painful for her to write. By the end of her life, it had almost paralysed her. She wrote to a friend that she was "literally vegetating, for I have very little locomotive powers beyond those that appertain to a cauliflower".{{sfn |Blank |2003}} On 23 February 1806, her husband died in a debtors' prison and Smith finally received some of the money he owed her, but she was too ill to do anything with it. She died a few months later, on 28 October 1806, at [[Tilford]] and was buried at Stoke Church, [[Stoke Park, Guildford|Stoke Park]], near [[Guildford]]. The lawsuit over her father-in-law's estate was settled seven years later, on 22 April 1813, more than 36 years after Richard Smith's death.{{sfn |Zimmerman |2007}}

==Literary circle==
Smith's novels were read and critiqued by her friends, who were also writers, as she would return the favour and they found it beneficial to improve and encourage each other's work. [[Ann Radcliffe]], who also wrote novels in Gothic fiction, was among these friends. Along with praise, Smith also received backlash from other writers. "Jane Austen – though she ridiculed Smith's novels, actually borrowed plot, character, and incident from them."{{sfn |Stanton |2003}} John Bennet (1792) wrote that "the little sonnets of Miss Charlotte Smith are soft, pensive, sentimental and pathetic, as a woman's productions should be. The muses, if I mistake not, will, in time, raise her to a considerable eminence. She has, as yet, stepped forth only in little things, with a diffidence that is characteristic of real genius in its first attempts. Her next public entre may be more in style, and more consequential."{{sfn |Bennet |1792}} Smith is never too specific about her republicanism; her ideas rest on the scholars [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[Voltaire]] Diderot, [[Montesquieu]], and [[John Locke]].{{sfn |Fry |1996}} "Charlotte Smith tried not to swim too strongly against the current of public view, because she needed to sell her novels in order to provide for her children".{{sfn|Oneț|2015}}

[[Robert Southey]], a poet and contributor to the early Romanticist movement, also sympathised with Smith's hardships. He even says, "[although] she has done more and done better than other women writers, it has not been her whole employment — she is not looking out for admiration and talking to show off."{{efn-ua |name=peacock}} In addition to [[Jane Austen]], [[Henrietta O'Neill]], Reverend [[Joseph Cooper Walker]], and Sarah Rose were people Smith considered trusted friends. After becoming famous for marrying into a great Irish home, Henrietta O'Neill, like Austen, provided Smith "with a poetic, sympathetic friendship and with literary connections."{{sfn |Stanton |2003}} Henrietta helped her gain an "entry into a fashionable, literary world to which she otherwise had little access; here she almost certainly met [[John Moore (Scottish physician)|Dr. Moore]] (author of ''A View of Society and Manners in Italy and Zeluco'') and Lady Londonderry, among others.{{sfn |Stanton |2003}}

One of Smith's longest friends and respected mentors was Reverend [[Joseph Cooper Walker]], an antiquarian and writer of Dublin. "Walker handled her dealings with John Rice, who published Dublin editions of many of her works. She confided openly in Walker about literary and familial matters."{{sfn |Stanton |2003}} Through the publication of personal letters Smith sent to a close companion, [[Sarah Rose]], readers are shown a far more positive and joyful side to Smith. Although today his writing is seen as mediocre, [[William Hayley]], another friend of Smith's, was "liked, respected, influential" during their time, especially as he was offered the laureateship upon the death of [[Thomas Warton]]."{{sfn |Stanton |2003}} As time went on, Hayley Smith withdrew his support from her in 1794 and corresponded with her infrequently after that. Smith perceived Hayley's actions as betrayal; he would often make claims that she was a "Lady of signal sorrows, signal woes." Even with her success as a writer and handful of accredited friends throughout her lifetime Smith was "sadly isolated from other writers and literary friends."{{sfn |Stanton |2003}} Although many believed Hayley's statements to be true, many saw Smith as a "woman of signal achievement, energy, ambition, devotion, and sacrifice. Her children and her literary career evoked from her best efforts, and did so in about equal measure."{{sfn |Stanton |2003}}

==Legacy and critical reputation==
Stuart Curran, as editor of Smith's poems, has written that she is "the first poet in England whom in retrospect we would call Romantic". She helped shape the "patterns of thought and conventions of style" for the period and was responsible for rekindling the sonnet form in England. She influenced popular [[Romantic poetry|Romantic poets]] of her time such as, [[William Wordsworth]] and [[John Keats]]. Wordsworth, the leading Romantic poet, believed that Smith wrote "with true feeling for rural nature, at a time when nature was not much regarded by English Poets".{{efn-ua |name=peacock |1={{harvnb |Peacock |1969 |ps=, quoting {{harvnb|Wordsworth|1835}}}}}} He also stated in the 1830s that she was "a lady to whom English verse is under greater obligations than are likely to be either acknowledged or remembered."{{sfn |Zimmerman |2007}} By the mid-19th century, however, Smith was largely forgotten.{{sfn |Curran |1993 |p=xix}} Smith was respected for also for her ten novels, publishing works in a variety of genres. These include Gothic, revolutionary, educational, epistolary but always incorporating the novel of sensibility.{{sfn |Stanton |2003}} Although they have yet to receive any "critical attention" today, Smith was famous for children's books she wrote in her writing period.{{efn-ua |name=peacock}} Smith is noted as one of the most popular poets of her time. One of the first poets to receive a salary, [[Henry James Pye]] claimed Smith was "[excelled] in two species of composition so different as the novel and the sonnet, and whose powers are so equally capable of charming the imagination, and awakening the passions."{{efn-ua |name=peacock}}

Smith is known for striving to produce her writing at the same level and expectation as [[Anna Laetitia Barbauld|Anna Barbauld]] and famous political economist, [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth|Francis Edgeworth]]. The inspiration she received in the 17th century from these writers helped her build an audience and dominate in certain genres. Smith was notorious for not only expressing her personal and emotional struggles but also for the anxiety and complications she faced when it came to meeting deadlines, mailing out completed volumes, and payment advancements. She was keen in persuading her publishers to work with her issues. Smith would submit final drafts in exchange for "food, lodging, and expenses for her children".{{sfn |Stanton |2003}} Other publishers willing to negotiate with Smith throughout her career as a writer were [[Thomas Cadell (publisher)|Thomas Cadell the elder]], Thomas Cadell the younger, and William Davies. Unfortunately she also struggled with disputes from "various booksellers over copyright, a printer's competence, or the quality of an engraving for an illustration. She would argue that the time was ripe for a second edition of a novel."{{sfn |Stanton |2003}}

Smith "clung to her own sense of herself as a gentlewoman of integrity".{{sfn |Stanton |2003}} The negative sides that Smith claimed to have experienced during the publication process were perceived as self-pity by many publishers of her time, affecting her relationship and reputation with them. Smith's push to be taken seriously and how she emerges as an essential figure of the "Age of Sensibility" is observed in her powerful use of vulnerability. Antje Blank of ''The Literary Encyclopedia'' states, "Few exploited fiction's potential of self-representation with such determination as Smith." Her work is defined as "squarely in the cult of sensibility: she believed in the virtue of kindness, in generosity to those less fortunate, and in the cultivation of the finer feelings of sympathy and tenderness for those who suffered needlessly."{{sfn |Stanton |2003}}

Ultimately, "Smith's autobiographical incursions" bridge the old and the new, "older poetic forms and an emerging Romantic voice."{{sfn |Oneț |2015}} Smith was a skillful satirist and political commentator on the condition of England, and this is, I think, the most interesting aspect of her fiction and the one that had most influence on later writers."{{sfn |Oneț |2015}} Oneț felt that Smith's work "rejected an identity defined exclusively by emotionality, matrimony, the family unit, and female sexuality." Overall Smith's career in writing was rejoiced, well perceived and popular until her later years of living. "Smith deserves to be read not simply as a writer whose work demonstrates changes in taste, but as one of the primary voices of her time and a worthy contemporary of the male romantic poets."{{sfn |Fry |1996}}

Smith's novels reappeared at the end of the 20th century, when critics "interested in the period's women poets and prose writers, the Gothic novel, the historical novel, the [[Social novel|social problem novel]], and post-colonial studies" argued for her significance as a writer.{{sfn |Zimmerman |2007}} They concluded that she helped to revitalise the English sonnet, a view found in Coleridge and others. Scott wrote that she "preserves in her landscapes the truth and precision of a painter" and poet. Barbauld claimed that Smith was the first to include sustained natural description in novels.{{sfn |Zimmerman |2007}} In 2008, Smith's complete prose became available to the general public. The edition contains all her novels, the children's stories and rural walks.{{sfn |Curran |2005}}
