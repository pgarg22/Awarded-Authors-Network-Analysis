'''Geraldine Brooks''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AO}} (born 14 September 1955) is an [[Australian Americans|Australian-American]] journalist and novelist whose 2005 novel ''[[March (novel)|March]]'' won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]].

== Early life ==
A native of Sydney, Geraldine Brooks grew up in its inner-west suburb of [[Ashfield, New South Wales|Ashfield]].  Her father, Lawrie Brooks, was an American big-band singer who was stranded in Adelaide on a tour of Australia when his manager absconded with the band's pay; he decided to remain in Australia, and became a newspaper sub-editor; her mother Gloria, from [[Boorowa]], was a public relations officer with radio station 2GB in Sydney.<ref>Larry Schwartz, "Author of her own success", ''The Age'', 22 April 2006, Encounter, p. 8</ref> She attended [[Bethlehem College, Ashfield|Bethlehem College]], a secondary school for girls, and the [[University of Sydney]].  Following graduation, she was a [[rookie]] reporter for ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and, after winning a [[Balibo Five|Greg Shackleton Memorial Scholarship]], moved to the United States, completing a master's degree at New York City's [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism]] in 1983.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/sundayprofile/stories/s1625452.htm |title=Geraldine Brooks interviewed by Julia Baird for ''ABC Sunday Profile'' |date=23 April 2006 |publisher=Abc.net.au |access-date=18 June 2012}}</ref> The following year, in the [[Southern France]] [[artisan]] village of [[Tourrettes-sur-Loup]], she married American journalist [[Tony Horwitz]] and [[Conversion to Judaism|converted]] to [[Judaism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/34450/format/html/displaystory.html |title=The wandering Haggadah: Novel follows journey of ancient Sephardic text (''J. the Jewish news weekly of Northern California'', 25 January 2008) |publisher=Jewishsf.com |date=25 January 2008 |access-date=18 June 2012}}</ref>

== Career ==
As a foreign correspondent for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', she covered crises in Africa, the Balkans, and the Middle East, with the stories from the Persian Gulf which she and her husband reported in 1990, receiving the [[Overseas Press Club]]'s Hal Boyle Award for "Best Newspaper or Wire Service Reporting from Abroad".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opcofamerica.org/opc_awards/archive/awards_1990.php

|access-date=21 December 2006 |title=OPC Awards: 1990 Award Winners |publisher=Overseas Press Club of America}}</ref> In 2006, she was awarded a fellowship at [[Harvard University]]'s [[Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.radcliffe.harvard.edu/fellowship-program/fellows|title=Fellows|website=Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University|language=en|access-date=2019-01-15}}</ref>

Brooks's first book, ''[[Nine Parts of Desire]]'' (1994), based on her experiences among Muslim women in the Middle East, was an international bestseller, translated into 17 languages. ''Foreign Correspondence'' (1997), which won the [[Nita Kibble Literary Award]] for women's writing, was a memoir and travel adventure about a childhood enriched by [[penpal]]s from around the world, and her adult quest to find them.

Her first novel, ''[[Year of Wonders]]'', published in 2001, became an international bestseller. Set in 1666, the story depicts a young woman's battle to save fellow villagers as well as her own soul when the [[bubonic plague]] suddenly strikes her small Derbyshire village of [[Eyam]].

Her next novel, ''[[March (novel)|March]]'' (2005), was inspired by her fondness for [[Louisa May Alcott]]'s ''[[Little Women]],'' which her mother had given her. To connect that memorable reading experience to her new status in 2002 as an American citizen, she researched the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] historical setting of ''Little Women'' and decided to create a chronicle of wartime service for the "absent father" of the March girls. Some aspects of this chronicle were informed by the life and philosophical writings of the Alcott family patriarch, [[Amos Bronson Alcott]], whom she profiled under the title "Orpheus at the Plow", in the 10 January 2005 issue of ''[[The New Yorker]]'', a month before ''March'' was published. The [[parallel novel]] received a mixed reaction from critics, but was nonetheless selected in December 2005 by the ''[[Washington Post]]'' as one of the five best fiction works published that year, and in April 2006, it won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for Fiction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/2006/2006.html |access-date=21 December 2006 |title=The Pulitzer Prizes — 2006 Winners |publisher=The Pulitzer Board |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061220212842/http://www.pulitzer.org/2006/2006.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 20 December 2006}}</ref>  She was eligible for the prize by virtue of her American citizenship, and was the first Australian to win the prize.

In her next novel, ''[[People of the Book (novel)|People of the Book]]'' (2008), Brooks explored a fictionalized history of the [[Sarajevo Haggadah]]. This novel was inspired by her reporting (for ''The New Yorker'') of human interest stories emerging in the aftermath of the 1991–95 [[breakup of Yugoslavia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/12/03/071203fa_fact_brooks |access-date=6 March 2009
|title=The Book of Exodus |work=The New Yorker}}</ref> The novel won both the Australian Book of the Year Award and the Australian Literary Fiction Award in 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/books/brooks-wins-book-of-the-year-award/2008/06/15/1213468236048.html |access-date=6 March 2009 |title=Brooks Wins Book of the Year Award |work=Sydney Morning Herald| date=16 June 2008}}</ref>

Her 2011 novel ''Caleb's Crossing'' is inspired by the life of [[Caleb Cheeshahteaumuck|Caleb Cheeshahteaumauk]], a [[Wampanoag]] convert to Christianity who was the first Native American to graduate from [[Harvard College]], in the seventeenth century.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Atlas |first1=Amelia |title=Pride of the Indian College |url=https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2011/05/pride-of-the-indian-college |website=Harvard Magazine |access-date=10 October 2021 |language=en |date=17 April 2011}}</ref>

Brooks, at the invitation of the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], delivered the 2011 series of the prestigious [[Boyer Lectures]]. These have been published as "The Idea of Home",<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://geraldinebrooks.com/books-by-geraldine-brooks/|title=The Novels|date=27 June 2014|website=GeraldineBrooks.com|language=en-US|access-date=28 June 2016}}</ref> and reveal her passionate humanist values.

''[[The Secret Chord]]'' (2015) is a historical novel based on the life of the biblical King [[David]] in the [[Iron Age|Second Iron Age]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geraldinebrooks.com/the-secret-chord/ |access-date=17 August 2015
