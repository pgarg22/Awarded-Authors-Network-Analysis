'''Johannes Bobrowski''' (originally ''Johannes Konrad Bernhard Bobrowski''; 9 April 1917 &ndash; 2 September 1965) was a [[Germany|German]] lyric poet, narrative writer, adaptor and essayist.

==Life==
Bobrowski was born on 9 April 1917<ref name=ShadowLands>Bobrowski, Johannes (1984). ''Shadow Lands: Selected Poems''. London: Anvil Press Poetry.</ref> in [[Tilsit]] in [[Province of East Prussia|East Prussia]]. In 1925, he moved first to [[Rastenburg]], then in 1928 on to [[Königsberg]], where he attended the ''[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]''. One of his teachers was [[Ernst Wiechert]]. In 1937, he started a degree in art history at the Humboldt University in [[Berlin]]. As a member of the [[Confessing Church]], Bobrowski had contact with the [[German resistance to Nazism|German resistance]] against [[Nazism|National Socialism]]. He was a lance corporal for the entire [[Second World War]] in [[Poland]], [[France]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1943 he married Johanna Buddrus.

From 1945 to 1949 Bobrowski was imprisoned by the [[Soviet Union]], where he spent time working in a coal mine. On his release, he returned home to his family in the  suburban Berlin district of [[Friedrichshagen]],<ref name=Scrase>Scrase, David (1995). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=XOyi3gvEcyMC&pg=PR13 Understanding Johannes Bobrowski]''. Columbia, SC: University of South Carolina Press. Chronology, p. xiii-xvi, and p. 2 (on the family's move to Friedrichshagen in 1937).</ref> in the [[East Berlin|Soviet occupation sector of Berlin]]. He worked as an editor, first for the ''Altberliner Verlag'', a children's publisher run by Lucie Grosner, and then, from 1959 on, for the ''Union Verlag'' publishing house.

Bobrowski's work was influenced by his knowledge of Eastern European landscapes and of the German, [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] and [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] cultures and languages, combined with ancient myths. His first poems were published during the war, in 1944, in the Munich-based journal ''Das innere Reich''.<ref name=Scrase/>

In 1960 he read his poems at a meeting in Aschaffenburg, Bavaria, of the influential  [[West Germany|West German]] literary association [[Group 47]] (Gruppe 47).<ref name=Wieczorek>Wieczorek, John (1999).

White (eds.), ''The Gruppe 47: Fifty Years on: A Re-Appraisal of its Literary and Political Significance''. Amsterdam: Rodopi. p. 213-227.</ref> The following year his first book of collected poems, ''Sarmatische Zeit'' (Sarmatian Times), was published in both West and East Germany.<ref name=Scrase/><ref name=Wieczorek/> After having missed the fall 1961 meeting of the Group 47, since it took place just after the building of the [[Berlin Wall]],<ref name=Wieczorek/> he was able to attend the subsequent meeting, held in October 1962 at the [[Wannsee]], in [[West Berlin]]. On that occasion he read seven poems from those that would later appear in his collection ''Wetterzeichen'' (Weather signs), and was awarded the group's prestigious literary prize.<ref name=Scrase/><ref name=Wieczorek/>

In 1964, Bobrowski became a member of the PEN Club.

Bobrowski died as a result of a perforated appendix in [[East Berlin]] on 2 September 1965,<ref name=ShadowLands/> and was buried in the Friedrichshagen cemetery.<ref name=Scrase/> Since 1992, the Foundation for Prussian Maritime Trade (Stiftung Preußische Seehandlung) has donated funds towards the Johannes Brobrowski Medal.
