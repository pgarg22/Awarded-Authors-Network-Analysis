'''John Guare'''  ({{IPAc-en|ɡ|ɛ|r}} {{Respell|GERR}};; born February 5, 1938) is an American [[playwright]] and screenwriter.  He is best known as the author of ''[[The House of Blue Leaves]]'' and ''[[Six Degrees of Separation (play)|Six Degrees of Separation]]''.

==Early life==
He was raised in [[Jackson Heights, Queens]].<ref name=times>Druckman, Stephen. [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/11/theater/theater-in-guare-s-art-zero-degrees-of-separation.html "THEATER; In Guare's Art, Zero Degrees of Separation"] ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 11, 1999</ref> In 1949 his father suffered a heart attack and subsequently moved the family to Ellenville, New York while he recovered.<ref name=black/> His father's relatives lived there, making it an idyllic experience for him. Guare did not regularly attend school in Ellenville because the school's daily practices were not in keeping with the recommendations of the Catholic Church, causing his father to suspect the school had communist leanings.  Instead of attending school, Guare was assigned home study and took exams intermittently, which allowed him time to go to the movies and see all the hits of the time.<ref name=black/> This had a lasting influence on Guare and his career.

He attended [[Georgetown University]] and the [[Yale School of Drama]], graduating in 1962 with a M.F.A in Playwriting.<ref name=black/><ref name=times/> Under the direction of Georgetown's [[Donn B. Murphy]], his play ''The Toadstool Boy'', about a country singer's quest for fame, won first place in the [[District of Columbia]] Recreation Department's One-Act-Play competition.<ref name=black>Plunka, Gene A., "Chapter 1", ''The Black Comedy of John Guare'', University of Delaware Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0874137632}}, pp 26–27, 29</ref> In 1960, the Mask and Bauble presented ''The Thirties Girl,'' a musical for which Guare did the book, much of the music and the lyrics,<ref name=black/> again under Murphy's tutelage. Set in Hollywood's turbulent 1920s, it deals with the dethronement of a reigning diva by a fresh-faced starlet.

==Career==
Guare's early plays, mostly comic one-acts exhibiting a flair for the absurd, include ''To Wally Pantoni, We Leave a Credenza'', produced at [[Caffe Cino]] in 1965<ref name=black/> and ''[[Muzeeka]]'' (1968).<ref>[http://www.lortel.org/lla_archive/index.cfm?search_by=show&id=3775 ''Muzeeka''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117031452/http://www.lortel.org/lla_archive/index.cfm?search_by=show&id=3775 |date=2015-11-17 }} lortel.org, accessed November 14, 2015</ref>

===Critical acclaim===
In his foreword to a collection of Guare's plays, [[Louis Malle]] wrote:

<blockquote>Guare practices a humor that is synonymous with lucidity, exploding genre and clichés, taking us to the core of human suffering: the awareness of corruption in our own bodies, death circling in. We try to fight it all by creating various mythologies, and it is Guare's peculiar aptitude for exposing these grandiose lies of ours that makes his work so magical.<ref>John Guare. ''Three Exposures''. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1982. {{ISBN|9780151901784}}. Page viii.</ref></blockquote>

[[Gregory Mosher]], formerly the artistic director of Lincoln Center Theatre, said that Guare, "along with David Mamet, Sam Shepard and a handful of other dramatists, reshaped the face of contemporary American theater over the past quarter century."<ref>Herman, Jan.
