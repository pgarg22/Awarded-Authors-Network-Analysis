His first collection of poetry, ''The Hoop'', was published in 1988 and won a [[Scottish Arts Council]] Book Award. Other poetry collections include ''Common Knowledge'' (1991), ''Feast Days'' (1992), winner of the [[Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize]], and ''The Asylum Dance'' (2000), winner of the [[2000 Whitbread Awards|Whitbread Poetry Award]] and shortlisted for both the [[Forward Poetry Prize]] (Best Poetry Collection of the Year) and the [[T.
