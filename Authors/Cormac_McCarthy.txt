McCarthy was born in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], although he was raised primarily in Tennessee. In 1951, he enrolled in the [[University of Tennessee]], but dropped out to join the [[US Air Force]]. His [[debut novel]], ''[[The Orchard Keeper]]'', was published in 1965. Awarded literary grants, McCarthy was able to travel to [[southern Europe]], where he wrote his second novel, ''[[Outer Dark]]'' (1968). ''[[Suttree]]'' (1979), like his other early novels, received generally positive reviews, but was not a commercial success. A [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Fellowship]] enabled him to travel to the American Southwest, where he researched and wrote his  fifth novel, ''[[Blood Meridian]]'' (1985). Although it garnered a lukewarm critical and commercial reception, it is now regarded as his [[magnum opus]], with some even labeling it the [[Great American Novel]].

McCarthy first experienced widespread success with ''[[All the Pretty Horses (novel)|All the Pretty Horses]]'' (1992), for which he received both the [[National Book Award]]<ref>[[National Book Foundation]]; retrieved March 28, 2012.<br/>(With acceptance speech by McCarthy and essay by Harold Augenbraum from the Awards 60-year anniversary blog.)</ref> and the [[National Book Critics Circle Award]]. It was followed by ''[[The Crossing (McCarthy novel)|The Crossing]]'' (1994) and ''[[Cities of the Plain (novel)|Cities of the Plain]]'' (1998), completing the [[Border Trilogy]]. His 2005 novel ''[[No Country for Old Men]]'' received mixed reviews. His 2006 novel ''[[The Road]]'' won the 2007 [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]] and the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for Fiction. Many of McCarthy's works have been adapted into film. ''No Country for Old Men'' was adapted into a [[No Country for Old Men (film)|2007 film]], winning four [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. ''[[All the Pretty Horses (film)|All the Pretty Horses]]'', ''[[The Road (2009 film)|The Road]]'', and ''[[Child of God (film)|Child of God]]'' have also been adapted into films, while ''Outer Dark'' was turned into a 15-minute short. McCarthy had a play adapted into a 2011 film, [[The Sunset Limited (film)|''The Sunset Limited'']].

McCarthy currently works with  the [[Santa Fe Institute]] (SFI), a multidisciplinary research center. At the SFI, he published the essay "[[The Kekulé Problem]]" (2017), which explores the [[Unconscious mind|human unconscious]] and the [[origin of language]]. He was elected to the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|title=APS Member History|url=https://search.amphilsoc.org/memhist/search?creator=Cormac+McCarthy&title=&subject=&subdiv=&mem=&year=&year-max=&dead=&keyword=&smode=advanced|access-date=2021-03-19|website=search.amphilsoc.org}}</ref> His next novel, ''The Passenger'', was announced in 2015 but has not yet been published {{as of|November 2021|lc=yes}}.

He described a moment when his teacher asked the class about their hobbies. McCarthy answered eagerly, as he later said, "I was the only one with any hobbies and I had every hobby there was... name anything, no matter how esoteric. I could have given everyone a hobby and still had 40 or 50 to take home."<ref name="Adams" />

In 1951, he began attending the [[University of Tennessee]] (UTK) but dropped out in 1953 to join the [[United States Air Force]]. While stationed in [[Alaska]], McCarthy read books voraciously, which he claimed was the first time he had done so.<ref name="Woodward"/> He returned to UTK in 1957, where he published two stories, "A Drowning Incident" and "Wake for Susan" in the student literary magazine, ''The Phoenix'', writing under the name C. J. McCarthy, Jr. For these, he won the [[Ingram Merrill Foundation|Ingram-Merrill Award]] for creative writing in 1959 and 1960. But in 1959, he dropped out of UTK for the final time and left for Chicago.<ref name="bio"/><ref name="Woodward"/>

For purposes of his writing career, McCarthy changed his first name from Charles to [[Cormac]] to avoid confusion, and comparison, with ventriloquist [[Edgar Bergen]]'s dummy [[Charlie McCarthy]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QFw722-PbCcC&pg=PT404|title=Irish Catholic Writers and the Invention of the American South|last=Giemza|first=Bryan|date=July 8, 2013|publisher=LSU Press|isbn=9780807150924|via=Google Books|access-date=November 29, 2017}}</ref> Cormac had been a family nickname given to his father by his Irish aunts.<ref name="Woodward"/> Other sources say he changed his name to honor the Irish chieftain [[Cormac MacCarthy]], who constructed [[Blarney Castle]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/desperately-seeking-cormac/|title=Desperately Seeking Cormac|first=Michael|last=Hall|work=[[Texas Monthly]]|date=July 1998|access-date=April 25, 2020|archive-date=January 31, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200131100220/https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/desperately-seeking-cormac/|url-status=live}}</ref>

After marrying fellow student Lee Holleman in 1961, McCarthy "moved to a shack with no heat and running water in the foothills of the [[Smoky Mountains]] outside of Knoxville". There the couple had a son, Cullen, in 1962.<ref name=":0" /> When writer [[James Agee]]'s childhood home was being demolished in Knoxville that year, McCarthy used the site's bricks to build fireplaces inside his [[Sevier County, Tennessee|Sevier County]] shack.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Rufus: James Agee in Tennessee|last=Brown|first=Paul F.|publisher=[[University of Tennessee Press]]|year=2018|isbn=978-1621904243|location=Knoxville|pages=251–52}}</ref> While Lee cared for the baby and tended to the chores of the house, Cormac asked her to get a day job so he could focus on his novel writing.

While living in the [[French Quarter]] in [[New Orleans]], McCarthy was expelled from a $40-a-month room for failing to pay his rent.<ref name="Woodward"/> When he traveled the country, McCarthy always carried a 100-watt bulb in his bag so he could read at night, no matter where he was sleeping.<ref name="Adams"/>

In the summer of 1965, using a Traveling Fellowship award from [[The American Academy of Arts and Letters]], McCarthy shipped out aboard the liner ''Sylvania'' hoping to visit Ireland. On the ship, he met Englishwoman Anne DeLisle, who was working on the ship as a dancer and singer. In 1966, they were married in England. Also in 1966, he received a [[Rockefeller Foundation]] Grant, which he used to travel around [[Southern Europe]] before landing in [[Ibiza]], where he wrote his second novel, ''[[Outer Dark]]'' (1968). Afterward, he returned to the United States with his wife, where ''Outer Dark'' was published to generally favorable reviews.<ref name=persp>{{cite book|last=Arnold|first=Edwin|title=[[Perspectives on Cormac McCarthy]]|publisher=[[University Press of Mississippi]]|year=1999|isbn=1-57806-105-9}}</ref>

In 1969, the couple moved to [[Louisville, Tennessee]], and purchased a dairy barn, which McCarthy renovated, doing the stonework himself.<ref name= persp/> According to DeLisle, the couple lived in "total poverty", bathing in a lake. DeLisle claimed, "Someone would call up and offer him $2,000 to come speak at a university about his books. And he would tell them that everything he had to say was there on the page. So we would eat beans for another week."<ref name="Woodward"/> While living in the barn, he wrote his next book, ''[[Child of God]]'' (1973). Like ''Outer Dark'' before it, ''Child of God'' was set in southern [[Appalachia]]. In 1976, McCarthy separated from Anne DeLisle and moved to [[El Paso, Texas]].<ref name=nytint>

In 1974, [[Richard Pearce (director)|Richard Pearce]] of [[PBS]] contacted McCarthy and asked him to write the screenplay for an episode of ''[[Visions (TV series)|Visions]]'', a television [[drama]] series. Beginning in early 1975, and armed with only "a few photographs in the footnotes to a 1928 biography of a famous pre-Civil War industrialist [[William Gregg (industrialist)|William Gregg]] as inspiration", he and McCarthy spent a year traveling the South to research the subject of industrialization there.<ref name="HCCA">{{Cite web |title=The Gardener's Son |url=https://www.harpercollins.ca/9780062387264/the-gardeners-son/ |access-date=February 17, 2021 |website=harpercollins.ca}}</ref> McCarthy completed the screenplay in 1976 and the episode, titled ''[[The Gardener's Son]]'', aired on January 6, 1977.

In 1979, McCarthy published the semi-autobiographical ''[[Suttree]]'', which he had written over 20 years, based on his experiences in Knoxville on the [[Tennessee River]].

In 1981, McCarthy was awarded a [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Fellowship]] worth $236,000.

He theorizes about the nature of the unconscious mind and its separation from human language. The unconscious, according to McCarthy, "is a machine for operating an animal" and "all animals have an unconscious." McCarthy postulates that language is a purely human cultural creation and not a biologically determined phenomenon.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=McCarthy |first=Cormac |url=http://nautil.us/issue/47/consciousness/the-kekul-problem |title=The Kekulé Problem: Where did language come from? |magazine=[[Nautilus Quarterly|Nautilus]] |issue=47 |date=April 20, 2017 |access-date=March 23, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200728222238/http://nautil.us/issue/47/consciousness/the-kekul-problem|archive-date=July 28, 2020}}</ref>

In 2015, McCarthy's next novel, ''The Passenger'', was announced at a multimedia event hosted in Santa Fe by the [[Lannan Foundation]].

===Bilingual narrative practice===

Cormac McCarthy is fluent in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], having lived in Ibiza, Spain, in the 1960s and later residing in El Paso, Texas, and Santa Fe, New Mexico.<ref name="muse.jhu.edu"/> Isabel Soto argues that after he learned the language, in his novels “Spanish and English modulate or permeate each other,” as it is “an essential part of McCarthy’s expressive discourse.” <ref>{{cite book |last=Soto |first=Isabel |editor-last=Benito |editor-first=Jesús |title=Literature and Ethnicity in the Cultural Borderlands |publisher=Brill |date=January 1, 2002 |pages=51–61 |chapter=Chapter 4:The Border Paradigm in Cormac McCarthy's The Crossing.|isbn=}}</ref> Katherine Sugg observes that McCarthy’s writing is “often considered a ‘multicultural’ and ‘bilingual’ narrative practice, particularly for its abundant use of untranslated Spanish dialogue.”<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sugg |first1=Katherine |date=2001 |title=Multicultural masculinities and the border romance in John Sayles's Lone Star and Cormac McCarthy's Border Trilogy |url= |journal=New Centennial Review |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=117–154 |doi= 10.1353/ncr.2003.0071|s2cid=144132488 }}</ref> Jeffrey Herlihy-Mera observes: "John Grady Cole is a native speaker of Spanish.

===Work ethic and process===
[[File:Olivetti Lettera 32 Typewriter.jpg|alt=Photograph of a turquoise-blue mechanical typewriter|thumb|McCarthy wrote all of his fiction and correspondence with a single [[Olivetti Lettera 32]] typewriter between the early 1960s and 2009.

McCarthy has dedicated himself to writing full time, choosing not to work other jobs to support his career. "I always knew that I didn't want to work," McCarthy has said.

Since 1958, McCarthy has written all of his literary work and correspondence with a mechanical [[typewriter]]. He originally used a [[Royal Typewriter Company|Royal]] but went looking for a more lightweight machine ahead of a trip to Europe in the early 1960s. He bought a portable [[Olivetti Lettera 32]] for $50 at a Knoxville pawn shop and typed about five million words over the next five decades. He maintained it by simply "blowing out the dust with a service station hose". [[Book collecting|Book dealer]] Glenn Horowitz said the modest typewriter acquired "a sort of talismanic quality" through its connection to McCarthy's monumental fiction, "as if [[Mount Rushmore]] was carved with a [[Swiss Army knife]]".<ref name="Cohen 2009" /> His Olivetti was auctioned in December 2009 at [[Christie's]], with the auction house estimating it would fetch between $15,000 and $20,000. It sold for $254,500, with proceeds donated to the Santa Fe Institute.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kennedy|first=Randy|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/04/cormac-mccarthys-typewriter-brings-254500-at-auction|title=Cormac McCarthy's Typewriter Brings $254,500 at Auction|work=The New York Times|department=ArtsBeat|date=December 4, 2009|access-date=January 11, 2010|archive-date=December 10, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091210224006/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/04/cormac-mccarthys-typewriter-brings-254500-at-auction/|url-status=live}}</ref> McCarthy replaced it with an identical model, bought for him by his friend John Miller for $11 plus $19.95 for shipping.<ref name="Cohen 2009" />

==Personal life and views==
[[File:Mexican Wolf 2 yfb-edit 1.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of a wolf | In the 1980s, McCarthy considered secretly reintroducing [[Mexican wolf|wolves into southern Arizona]].]]
McCarthy is reportedly a [[teetotaler]]. According to Richard B. Woodward: "McCarthy doesn't drink anymore – he quit 16 years ago in El Paso, with one of his young girlfriends – and ''Suttree'' reads like a farewell to that life. 'The friends I do have are simply those who quit drinking,' he says. 'If there is an occupational hazard to writing, it's drinking'."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/05/17/specials/mccarthy-venom.html|newspaper=The New York Times|title=The New York Times: Book Review Search Article|date=May 17, 1998|access-date=May 25, 2015|archive-date=July 16, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716031054/http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/05/17/specials/mccarthy-venom.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the late 1990s, McCarthy moved to the [[Tesuque, New Mexico]] area, north of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], with his third wife, Jennifer Winkley, and their son, John. McCarthy and Winkley divorced in 2006.<ref name="Cormac Country"/>

In 2013, a [[Twitter]] account impersonating McCarthy (@CormacCMcCarthy) was created by Scottish writer Michael Crossan, quickly amassing several thousand followers and recognition by site owner [[Jack Dorsey]]. Five hours after the account's creation, McCarthy's publisher confirmed that the account was fake and that McCarthy did not own a computer.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Creamer |first1=Matt |title=An Unpublished Novelist's Week as Fake Cormac McCarthy |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/01/unpublished-novelists-week-fake-cormac-mccarthy/332435/ |access-date=August 2, 2021 |work=[[The Atlantic]] |date=January 31, 2013}}</ref> In 2018, another account impersonating McCarthy (@CormacMcCrthy) was created.

===Science and literature===
In one of his few interviews, McCarthy revealed that he respects only authors who "deal with issues of life and death", citing [[Henry James]] and [[Marcel Proust]] as examples of writers who do not. "I don't understand them&nbsp;... To me, that's not literature. A lot of writers who are considered good I consider strange," he said.<ref name= nytint/> 
Regarding his own literary constraints when writing novels, McCarthy said he is "not a fan of some of the Latin American writers, [[magical realism]]. You know, it's hard enough to get people to believe what you're telling them without making it impossible. It has to be vaguely plausible."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1673269-2,00.html|title=A conversation between author Cormac McCarthy and the Coen Brothers, about the new movie No Country for Old Men|website=Time.com|date=October 18, 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228165938/http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1673269-2,00.html|archive-date=February 28, 2017}}</ref> He has cited ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' (1851) as his favorite novel.<ref name="Cormac Country"/>

McCarthy has an aversion to other writers, preferring the company of scientists. He has voiced his admiration for scientific advances: "What physicists did in the 20th century was one of the extraordinary flowerings ever in the human enterprise."<ref name="Cormac Country"/> At MacArthur reunions, McCarthy has typically shunned his fellow writers to fraternize instead with scientists like physicist [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and whale biologist [[Roger Payne]]. Of all of his interests, McCarthy stated, "Writing is way, way down at the bottom of the list."<ref name= nytint/>
