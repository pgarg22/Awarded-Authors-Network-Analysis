'''Philip Arthur Larkin''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|CH|CBE|FRSL}} (9 August 1922 – 2 December 1985) was an English poet, novelist, and librarian. His first book of poetry, ''[[The North Ship]]'', was published in 1945, followed by two novels, ''[[Jill (novel)|Jill]]'' (1946) and ''[[A Girl in Winter]]'' (1947), and he came to prominence in 1955 with the publication of his second collection of poems, ''[[The Less Deceived]]'', followed by ''[[The Whitsun Weddings]]'' (1964) and ''[[High Windows]]'' (1974). He contributed to ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' as its [[jazz]] critic from 1961 to 1971, articles gathered in ''All What Jazz: A Record Diary 1961–71'' (1985), and he edited ''[[The Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse]]'' (1973).<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/330650/Philip-Larkin Philip Arthur Larkin] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527055723/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/330650/Philip-Larkin |date=27 May 2009 }}, ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved 12 November 2009.</ref> His many honours include the [[Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry]].<ref>Sleeve note, ''Letters to Monica'', Faber 2010.</ref> He was offered, but declined, the position of [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]] in 1984, following the death of [[John Betjeman|Sir John Betjeman]].

After graduating from [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] in 1943 with a [[Double first|first]] in English Language and Literature, Larkin became a librarian. It was during the thirty years he worked with distinction as university librarian at the [[Brynmor Jones Library]] at the [[University of Hull]] that he produced the greater part of his published work. His poems are marked by what [[Andrew Motion]] calls "a very English, glum accuracy” about emotions, places, and relationships, and what [[Donald Davie]] described as "lowered sights and diminished expectations". Eric Homberger (echoing [[Randall Jarrell]]) called him "the saddest heart in the post-war supermarket"—Larkin himself said that deprivation for him was “what daffodils were for [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]]”.<ref>Motion 2005, pp. 208–209; Chatterjee 2006, p. 19 (for Donald Davie).</ref> Influenced by [[W. H. Auden]], [[W. B. Yeats]], and [[Thomas Hardy]], his poems are highly structured but flexible verse forms. They were described by [[Jean Hartley]], the ex-wife of Larkin's publisher George Hartley (the Marvell Press), as a "piquant mixture of lyricism and discontent",<ref name="poetryarchive1"/> though anthologist Keith Tuma writes that there is more to Larkin's work than its reputation for dour pessimism suggests.<ref name="Tuma 2001, p. 445">Tuma 2001, p. 445.</ref>

Larkin's public persona was that of the no-nonsense, solitary Englishman who disliked fame and had no patience for the trappings of the public literary life.<ref name=Banville/> The posthumous publication by [[Anthony Thwaite]] in 1992 of his [[Selected Letters of Philip Larkin, 1940–1985|letters]] triggered controversy about his personal life and political views, described by [[John Banville]] as hair-raising, but also in places hilarious.<ref name=Banville>Banville 2006.</ref> [[Lisa Jardine]] called him a "casual, habitual racist, and an easy [[Misogyny|misogynist]]", but the academic John Osborne argued in 2008 that "the worst that anyone has discovered about Larkin are some crass letters and a taste for porn softer than what passes for mainstream entertainment".<ref>Cooper 2004, p. 1, for Lisa Jardine; Osborne 2008, p. 15.</ref> Despite the controversy Larkin was chosen in a 2003 [[Poetry Book Society]] survey, almost two decades after his death, as Britain's best-loved poet of the previous 50 years, and in 2008 ''[[The Times]]'' named him Britain's greatest post-war writer.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3193692.stm Larkin is nation's top poet], BBC News, 23 October 2003; {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511204023/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article3127837.ece |date=11 May 2008 |title=The 50 greatest British writers since 1945 }}, ''The Times'', 5 January 2008.</ref>

In 1973 a ''[[Coventry Evening Telegraph]]'' reviewer referred to Larkin as "the bard of Coventry",<ref>a poet "with feet firmly on the ground," ''Coventry Evening Telegraph'', 15 November 1973, p.17</ref> but in 2010, 25 years after his death, it was Larkin's adopted home city, [[Kingston upon Hull]], that commemorated him with the [[Larkin 25]] Festival<ref>{{cite web

Philip Larkin was born on 9 August 1922 at 2, Poultney Road, [[Radford, Coventry]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://orlando.cambridge.org/public/svPeople?person_id=larkph |title=Philip Larkin © Orlando Project |publisher=Orlando.cambridge.org |date=2 December 1985 |access-date=17 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513034249/http://orlando.cambridge.org/public/svPeople?person_id=larkph |archive-date=13 May 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>  the only son and younger child of Sydney Larkin (1884–1948) and his wife Eva Emily (1886–1977), daughter of [[HM Customs and Excise|first-class excise officer]] William James Day. Sydney Larkin's family originated in [[Kent]], but had lived since at least the eighteenth century at [[Lichfield]], [[Staffordshire]], where they were in trade first as tailors, then also as coach-builders and shoe-makers. The Day family were of Epping, Essex, but moved to Leigh in Lancashire in 1914 where William Day took a post administering pensions and other dependent allowances.<ref> Philip Larkin: A Writer's Life, Andrew Motion, Faber and Faber, 2018, pp. 1-2</ref>

Larkin's early childhood was in some respects unusual: he was educated at home until the age of eight by his mother and sister, neither friends nor relatives ever visited the family home, and he developed a stammer.<ref>Bradford 2005, pp. 28, 31.</ref> Nonetheless, when he joined Coventry's King Henry VIII Junior School he fitted in immediately and made close, long-standing friendships, such as those with James "Jim" Sutton, Colin Gunner and Noel "Josh" Hughes. Although home life was relatively cold, Larkin enjoyed support from his parents. For example, his deep passion for [[jazz]] was supported by the purchase of a drum kit and a [[saxophone]], supplemented by a subscription to ''[[Down Beat]]''. From the junior school he progressed to King Henry VIII Senior School. He fared quite poorly when he sat his [[School Certificate (UK)|School Certificate]] exam at the age of 16. Despite his results, he was allowed to stay on at school; two years later he earned distinctions in English and History, and passed the entrance exams for [[St John's College, Oxford]], to read English.<ref>Bradford 2005, p. 38.</ref>

Larkin began at Oxford University in October 1940, a year after the outbreak of [[Second World War]]. The old upper class traditions of university life had, at least for the time being, faded, and most of the male students were studying for highly truncated degrees.<ref>Bradford 2005, p. 39.</ref> Due to his poor eyesight, Larkin failed his military medical examination and was able to study for the usual three years.<ref>Motion, p. 72</ref> Through his tutorial partner, Norman Iles, he met [[Kingsley Amis]], who encouraged his taste for ridicule and irreverence and who remained a close friend throughout Larkin's life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/8770871/two-angry-old-men/|title=Two angry old men – The Spectator|date=1 December 2012|publisher=spectator.co.uk|access-date=6 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130830070827/http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/8770871/two-angry-old-men/|archive-date=30 August 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Amis, Larkin and other university friends formed a group they dubbed "The Seven", meeting to discuss each other's poetry, listen to jazz, and drink enthusiastically. During this time he had his first real social interaction with the opposite sex, but made no romantic headway.<ref>Bradford 2005, p. 59.</ref> In 1943 he sat his [[Final examination|finals]], and, having dedicated much of his time to his own writing, was greatly surprised at being awarded a [[British undergraduate degree classification|first-class honours degree]].<ref>Motion 1993, p. 104.</ref>

In 1943 Larkin was appointed librarian of the public library in [[Wellington, Shropshire]]. It was while working there that in early 1944 he met his first girlfriend, Ruth Bowman, an academically ambitious 16-year-old schoolgirl.<ref>Bradford 2005, pp. 68–9.</ref> In 1945, Ruth went to continue her studies at [[King's College London]]; during one of his visits their friendship developed into a sexual relationship. By June 1946, Larkin was halfway through qualifying for membership of the [[Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals|Library Association]] and was appointed assistant librarian at [[University College, Leicester]]. It was visiting Larkin in Leicester and witnessing the university's [[Common room (university)|Senior Common Room]] that gave Kingsley Amis the inspiration to write ''[[Lucky Jim]]'' (1954), the novel that made Amis famous and to whose long gestation Larkin contributed considerably.<ref name="Motion 1993, p. 238">Motion 1993, p. 238.</ref> Six weeks after his father's death from cancer in March 1948, Larkin proposed to Ruth, and that summer the couple spent their annual holiday touring [[Thomas Hardy's Wessex|Hardy country]].<ref name="bradford70">Bradford 2005, p. 70.</ref>

In June 1950 Larkin was appointed sub-librarian at [[The Queen's University of Belfast]], a post he took up that September. Before his departure he and Ruth split up.  At some stage between the appointment to the position at Queen's and the end of the engagement to Ruth, Larkin's friendship with [[Relationships that influenced Philip Larkin#Monica Jones|Monica Jones]], a lecturer in English at Leicester, also developed into a sexual relationship. He spent five years in Belfast, which appear to have been the most contented of his life. While his relationship with Jones developed, he also had "the most satisfyingly erotic [experience] of his life" with [[Patsy Strang]], who at the time was in an [[open marriage]] with one of his colleagues.<ref>Bradford 2005, p. 100.</ref> At one stage she offered to leave her husband to marry Larkin. From 1951 onwards Larkin holidayed with Jones in various locations around the British Isles. While in Belfast he also had a significant though sexually undeveloped friendship with [[Winifred Arnott]], the subject of "Lines on a Young Lady's Photograph Album", which came to an end when she married in 1954. This was the period in which he gave Kingsley Amis extensive advice on the writing of ''Lucky Jim''.<ref name="Motion 1993, p. 238"/> Amis repaid the debt by dedicating the finished book to Larkin.<ref>Hartley 1989, p. 7.</ref>

[[File:Philip Larkin -Flat in Hull 1.jpg|upright|right|thumb|This second-floor flat overlooking Pearson Park in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] was Larkin's rented accommodation from 1956 to 1974 (photo&nbsp;2008).|alt=Larkin's former second-floor flat in Hull was part of a building of conventional red-brick construction in a residential area.]]
In 1955 Larkin became University Librarian at the [[University of Hull]], a post he held until his death.<ref>Motion 1993, pp. 244–245</ref> [[Raymond L. Brett|Professor R. L. Brett]], who was chairman of the library committee that appointed him and a friend, wrote, "At first I was impressed with the time he spent in his office, arriving early and leaving late. It was only later that I realised that his office was also his study where he spent hours on his private writing as well as the work of the library. Then he would return home and on a good many evenings start writing again."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philiplarkin.com/pdfs/essays/psycho-literary_sketch_rbrett.pdf |author=Brett |year=1996 |title=Philip Larkin at Hull: A Psycho-Literary Sketch |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903140224/http://www.philiplarkin.com/pdfs/essays/psycho-literary_sketch_rbrett.pdf |archive-date=3 September 2013  }}</ref> For his first year he lodged in [[bedsit]]s. In 1956, at the age of 34, he rented a self-contained flat on the top-floor of 32 Pearson Park, a three-storey red-brick house overlooking the park, previously the American Consulate.<ref>Motion 1993, p. 276.</ref> This, it seems, was the vantage point later commemorated in the poem ''[[High Windows (poem)|High Windows]].''<ref>Bradford 2005, p.154</ref> Of the city itself Larkin commented: "I never thought about Hull until I was here. Having got here, it suits me in many ways. It is a little on the edge of things, I think even its natives would say that. I rather like being on the edge of things. One doesn't really go anywhere by design, you know, you put in for jobs and move about, you know, I've lived in other places."<ref>Larkin, speaking on BBC's ''[[Monitor (UK TV series)|Monitor]]'', 15 December 1964</ref> In the post-war years, Hull University underwent significant expansion, as was typical of British universities during that period. When Larkin took up his appointment there, the plans for a new university library were already far advanced. He made a great effort in just a few months to familiarize himself with them before they were placed before the [[University Grants Committee (United Kingdom)|University Grants Committee]]; he suggested a number of emendations, some major and structural, all of which were adopted. It was built in two stages, and in 1967 it was named the [[Brynmor Jones Library]] after Sir [[Brynmor Jones (academic)|Brynmor Jones]], the university's [[Chancellor (education)|vice-chancellor]].

One of Larkin's colleagues at Hull said he became a great figure in post-war British librarianship.<ref>Goodman 1997, p. 4.</ref> Ten years after the new library's completion, Larkin computerized records for the entire library stock, making it the first library in Europe to install a [[Geac Computer Corporation|GEAC]] system, an automated online circulation system. Richard Goodman wrote that Larkin excelled as an administrator, committee man and arbitrator. "He treated his staff decently, and he motivated them", Goodman said. "He did this with a combination of efficiency, high standards, humour and compassion."<ref>Goodman 1997, p. 7</ref>  He rejected the [[Net Book Agreement]].<ref>Ball, D., 2012. "Managing suppliers for collection development: the UK higher education perspective." In: Fieldhouse, M. and Marshall, A., eds. ''Collection Development in the Digital Age.'' London: Facet, 111-124.</ref> From 1957 until his death, Larkin's secretary was Betty Mackereth. All access to him by his colleagues was through her, and she came to know as much about Larkin's compartmentalized life as anyone.<ref>Bradford 2005, p. 241, which includes a quote from Motion 1993, p. 282.</ref> During his 30 years there, the library's stock sextupled, and the budget expanded from £4,500 to £448,500, in real terms a twelvefold increase.<ref>Goodman 1997, p. 10</ref>

In February 1961 Larkin's friendship with his colleague Maeve Brennan became romantic, despite her strong Roman Catholic beliefs.<ref>Bradford 2005, p. 183.</ref> In early 1963 Brennan persuaded him to go with her to a dance for university staff, despite his preference for smaller gatherings. This seems to have been a pivotal moment in their relationship, and he memorialised it in his longest (and unfinished) poem "The Dance".<ref>Bradford 2005, p. 199.</ref> Around this time, also at her prompting, Larkin learnt to drive and bought a car – his first, a [[Singer Gazelle]].<ref>''Letters to Monica'', p. 326.</ref> Meanwhile, Monica Jones, whose parents had died in 1959, bought a holiday cottage in [[Haydon Bridge]], near [[Hexham]],<ref>Bradford 2005, pp. 181 & 193.</ref> which she and Larkin visited regularly.<ref>Motion 1993, p. 319.</ref><ref><!-- please don't remove this while dead links are being sorted - don't want to mess up the numbering! -->Blank reference</ref> His poem "Show Saturday" is a description of the 1973 [[Bellingham, Northumberland|Bellingham]] show in the North Tyne valley.<ref>Motion 1993, p. 437.</ref>

In 1964, following the publication of ''[[The Whitsun Weddings]]'', Larkin was the subject of an edition of the arts programme ''[[Monitor (UK TV series)|Monitor]]'', directed by [[Patrick Garland]].<ref>Down Cemetery Road, closing credits.</ref> The programme, which shows him being interviewed by fellow poet [[John Betjeman]] in a series of locations in and around [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], allowed Larkin to play a significant part in the creation of his own public persona; one he would prefer his readers to imagine.<ref>Bradford 2005, p. 203.</ref>

In 1968, Larkin was offered the [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]], which he declined. Later in life he accepted the offer of being made a [[Companion of Honour]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16736495|title=BBC News – Queen's honours: People who have turned them down named|work=[[BBC Online]]|access-date=12 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126094501/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16736495|archive-date=26 November 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

Larkin's role in the creation of Hull University's new Brynmor Jones Library had been important and demanding. Soon after the completion of the second and larger phase of construction in 1969,<ref>Bradford 2005, p. 217.</ref> he was able to redirect his energies. In October 1970, he started to work on compiling a new anthology, <!-- if changing the title of this book, please provide a citation -->''[[The Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse]]'' (1973). He was awarded a Visiting Fellowship at [[All Souls College, Oxford]], for two academic terms, allowing him to consult Oxford's [[Bodleian Library]], a [[copyright library]]. While he was in Oxford he passed responsibility for the Library to his deputy, [[Brenda Moon]]. Larkin was a major contributor to the re-evaluation of the poetry of [[Thomas Hardy]], which, in comparison to his novels, had been overlooked; in Larkin's "idiosyncratic" and "controversial" anthology,<ref>Motion 1993, p. 407.</ref><ref name="Motion 1993, p. 431">Motion 1993, p. 431.</ref> Hardy was the poet most generously represented. There were twenty-seven poems by Hardy, compared with only nine by [[T. S. Eliot]] (however, Eliot is most famous for long poems); the other poets most extensively represented were [[William Butler Yeats|W. B. Yeats]], [[W. H. Auden]] and [[Rudyard Kipling]]. Larkin included six of his own poems—the same number as for [[Rupert Brooke]]. In the process of compiling the volume he had been disappointed not to find more and better poems as evidence that the clamour over the [[Modernists]] had stifled the voices of traditionalists.<ref name="Motion 1993, p. 431" /> The most favourable responses to the anthology were those of Auden and John Betjeman, while the most hostile was that of [[Donald Davie]], who accused Larkin of "positive cynicism" and of encouraging "the perverse triumph of philistinism, the cult of the amateur ... [and] the weakest kind of Englishry". After an initial period of anxiety about the anthology's reception, Larkin enjoyed the clamour.<ref>Bowen 2008, p. 107.</ref>

In 1971, Larkin regained contact with his schoolfriend Colin Gunner, who had led a picturesque life. Their subsequent correspondence has gained notoriety as Larkin expressed right-wing views and used racist language.<ref>{{cite web

 }}</ref> In the period from 1973 to 1974, Larkin became an Honorary Fellow of [[St John's College, Oxford]], and was awarded [[honorary degree]]s by [[University of Warwick|Warwick]], [[University of St Andrews|St Andrews]] and [[University of Sussex|Sussex]] universities. In January 1974, Hull University informed Larkin that they were going to dispose of the building on Pearson Park in which he lived. Shortly afterwards he bought a detached two-storey 1950s house in [[Newland Park]] which was described by his university colleague John Kenyon as "an entirely middle-class backwater". Larkin, who moved into the house in June, thought the four-bedroom property "utterly undistinguished" and reflected, "I can't say it's the kind of dwelling that is eloquent of the nobility of the human spirit".<ref>Motion 1993, p. 440.</ref>

Shortly after splitting up with Maeve Brennan in August 1973, Larkin attended W. H. Auden's memorial service at [[Christ Church, Oxford]], with Monica Jones as his official partner.<ref>Motion 1993, p. 438.</ref> In March 1975, the relationship with Brennan restarted, and three weeks after this he initiated a secret affair with Betty Mackereth, who served as his secretary for 28 years, writing the long-undiscovered poem "We met at the end of the party" for her.<ref>{{cite web

In 1976, Larkin was the guest of [[Roy Plomley]] on BBC's ''[[Desert Island Discs]]''. His choice of music included "[[Dallas Blues]]" by [[Louis Armstrong]], ''[[Spem in alium]]'' by [[Thomas Tallis]] and the [[Symphony No. 1 (Elgar)|Symphony No. 1 in A flat major]] by [[Edward Elgar]]. His favourite piece was "I'm Down in the Dumps" by [[Bessie Smith]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p009n0l8|title=Philip Larkin, Desert Island Discs – BBC Radio 4|publisher=bbc.co.uk|access-date=6 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151230040821/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p009n0l8|archive-date=30 December 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

In December 2010, as part of the commemorations of the 25th anniversary of Larkin's death, the BBC broadcast a programme entitled ''Philip Larkin and the Third Woman'' focusing on his affair with Mackereth in which she spoke for the first time about their relationship.  It included a reading of a newly discovered secret poem, ''Dear Jake'', and revealed that Mackereth was one of the inspirations for his writings.<ref>{{cite news

Larkin turned sixty in 1982. This was marked most significantly by a collection of essays entitled ''[[Larkin at Sixty]]'', edited by [[Anthony Thwaite]] and published by [[Faber and Faber]].<ref name=LarkinSixty>Thwaite 1982.</ref> There were also two television programmes: an episode of ''[[The South Bank Show]]'' presented by [[Melvyn Bragg]] in which Larkin made off-camera contributions, and a half-hour special on the BBC that was devised and presented by the Labour Shadow Cabinet Minister [[Roy Hattersley]].<ref>Motion 1993, p. 494.</ref>

In 1983, Jones was hospitalised with [[Herpes zoster|shingles]]. The severity of her symptoms, including its effects on her eyes, distressed Larkin. As her health declined, regular care became necessary: within a month she moved into his Newland Park home and remained there for the rest of her life.<ref>Motion 1993, p. 498.</ref>

The headstone is inscribed with the words "Philip Larkin  1922–1985  Writer" on three lines with the dates on the middle line. It is situated in a cemetery with other headstones.]]
At the memorial service for John Betjeman, who died in July 1984, Larkin was asked if he would accept the post of [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]]. He declined, not least because he felt he had long since ceased to be a writer of poetry in a meaningful sense.<ref>Bradford 2005, p. 260.</ref> The following year, Larkin began to suffer from [[oesophageal cancer]]. On 11 June 1985, he underwent surgery, but his cancer was found to have spread and was inoperable. On 28 November, he collapsed and was readmitted to hospital. He died four days later, on 2 December 1985, at the age of 63, and was buried at [[Cottingham, East Riding of Yorkshire|Cottingham]] municipal cemetery near Hull.<ref>Motion 1993, p. 524.</ref>
 
Larkin had asked on his deathbed that his diaries be destroyed. The request was granted by Jones, the main beneficiary of his will, and Betty Mackereth; the latter shredded the unread diaries page by page, then had them burned.<ref>Motion 1993, p. 522.</ref> His will was found to be contradictory regarding his other private papers and unpublished work; legal advice left the issue to the discretion of his literary executors, who decided the material should not be destroyed.<ref>Motion 1993, p. xvi.</ref> When she died on 15 February 2001, Jones, in turn, left £1&nbsp;million to [[St Paul's Cathedral]], [[Hexham Abbey]] and [[Durham Cathedral]].<ref>{{cite news

From his mid-teens, Larkin "wrote ceaselessly", producing both poetry, initially modelled on Eliot and W. H. Auden, and fiction: he wrote five full-length novels, each of which he destroyed shortly after their completion.<ref>Bradford 2005, pp. 32–34.</ref> While he was at Oxford University, his first published poem, "Ultimatum", appeared in ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]''. He developed a pseudonymous alter ego in this period for his prose: [[Brunette Coleman]]. Under this name he wrote two novellas, ''Trouble at Willow Gables'' and ''Michaelmas Term at St Brides'' (2002), as well as a supposed autobiography and an equally fictitious creative manifesto called "What we are writing for". Richard Bradford has written that these curious works show "three registers: cautious indifference, archly overwritten symbolism with a hint of Lawrence and prose that appears to disclose its writer's involuntary feelings of sexual excitement".<ref>Bradford 2005, p. 51.</ref>

After these works, Larkin began to write his first published novel ''[[Jill (novel)|Jill]]'' (1946). This was published by [[Reginald Caton|Reginald A. Caton]], a publisher of barely legal pornography, who also issued serious fiction as a cover for his core activities.<ref>Bradford 2005, p. 55.</ref> Around the time that ''Jill'' was being prepared for publication, Caton inquired of Larkin if he also wrote poetry. This resulted in the publication, three months before ''Jill'', of ''[[The North Ship]]'' (1945), a collection of poems written between 1942 and 1944 which showed the increasing influence of [[William Butler Yeats|Yeats]]. Immediately after completing ''Jill'', Larkin started work on the novel ''A Girl in Winter'' (1947), completing it in 1945. This was published by [[Faber and Faber]] and was well received, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' calling it "an exquisite performance and nearly faultless".<ref>Bradford 2005, p. 77.</ref> Subsequently, he made at least three concerted attempts at writing a third novel, but none developed beyond a solid start.<ref>Bradford 2005, p. 75.</ref>

===Mature works===

It was during Larkin's five years in [[Belfast]] that he reached maturity as a poet.<ref>Bradford 2005, p. 103.</ref> The bulk of his next published collection of poems, ''[[The Less Deceived]]'' (1955), was written there, though eight of the twenty-nine poems included were from the late 1940s. This period also saw Larkin make his final attempts at writing prose fiction, and he gave extensive help to Kingsley Amis with ''[[Lucky Jim]]'', which was Amis's first published novel. In October 1954 an article in ''[[The Spectator]]'' made the first use of the title [[The Movement (literature)|The Movement]] to describe the dominant trend in British post-war literature.<ref>Motion 1993, p. 242.</ref> Poems by Larkin were included in a 1953 [[International PEN|PEN]] Anthology that also featured poems by Amis and [[Robert Conquest]], and Larkin was seen to be a part of this grouping.<ref>Motion 1993, p. 243.</ref> In 1951, Larkin compiled a collection called ''XX Poems'' which he had privately printed in a run of just 100 copies. Many of the poems in it subsequently appeared in his next published volume.<ref name="PL Society"/> <!-- a better reference from Motion should be added here -->

In November 1955, ''The Less Deceived'', was published by the Marvell Press, an independent company in [[Hessle]] near Hull (dated October). At first the volume attracted little attention, but in December it was included in ''[[The Times]]''{{'}} list of ''Books of the Year''.<ref name="motion269">Motion 1993, p. 269.</ref> From this point, the book's reputation spread and sales blossomed throughout 1956 and 1957. During his first five years in Hull, the pressures of work slowed Larkin's output to an average of just two-and-a-half poems a year, but this period saw the writing of some of his best-known poems, such as "[[An Arundel Tomb]]", "[[The Whitsun Weddings]]" and "Here".<ref>{{cite book

</ref>

In 1963, Faber and Faber reissued ''Jill'', with the addition of a long introduction by Larkin that included much information about his time at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] and his friendship with Kingsley Amis. This acted as a prelude to the publication the following year of ''[[The Whitsun Weddings]]'', the volume which cemented his reputation; a Fellowship of the [[Royal Society of Literature]] was granted to Larkin almost immediately. In the years that followed, Larkin wrote several of his most best-known poems, followed in the 1970s by a series of longer and more sober poems, including "The Building" and "The Old Fools".<ref>{{cite book
 |first= Philip

 |pages= 191–3, 196–7, 208–9}}
</ref> All of these appeared in Larkin's final collection, ''[[High Windows]]'', which was published in June 1974. Its more direct use of language meant that it did not meet with uniform praise; nonetheless it sold over twenty thousand copies in its first year alone. For some critics it represents a falling-off from his previous two books,<ref>Swarbrick 1995, pp. 122–23.</ref> yet it contains a number of his much-loved pieces, including "[[This Be The Verse]]" and "The Explosion", as well as the [[High Windows (poem)|title poem]]. "Annus Mirabilis" (Year of Wonder), also from that volume, contains the frequently quoted observation that sexual intercourse began in 1963, which the narrator claims was "rather late for me". Bradford, prompted by comments in Maeve Brennan's memoir, suggests that the poem commemorates Larkin's relationship with Brennan moving from the romantic to the sexual.<ref>Bradford 2005, p. 212.</ref>

Later in 1974 he started work on his final major published poem, "Aubade". It was completed in 1977 and published in 23 December issue of ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]''.<ref>Motion 1993, p. 468.</ref> After "Aubade" Larkin wrote only one poem that has attracted close critical attention, the posthumously published and intensely personal "Love Again".<ref>Bradford 2005, pp. 249–251.</ref>

Larkin's poetry has been characterized as combining "an ordinary, colloquial style", "clarity", a "quiet, reflective tone", "ironic understatement" and a "direct" engagement with "commonplace experiences",<ref>Moran 2002, p. 151.</ref> while [[Jean Hartley]] summed his style up as a "piquant mixture of lyricism and discontent".<ref name="poetryarchive1">{{cite web

Larkin's earliest work showed the influence of Eliot, Auden and Yeats, and the development of his mature poetic identity in the early 1950s coincided with the growing influence on him of [[Thomas Hardy]].<ref name="bradford70"/> The "mature" Larkin style, first evident in ''The Less Deceived'', is "that of the detached, sometimes lugubrious, sometimes tender observer", who, in Hartley's phrase, looks at "ordinary people doing ordinary things". He disparaged poems that relied on "shared classical and literary allusions – what he called ''the myth-kitty'', and the poems are never cluttered with elaborate imagery."<ref>[[Jean Sprackland]], speaking on ''The Whitsun Weddings'' BBC Radio Four, 1 December 2013 [http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03jyp1k] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210021049/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03jyp1k |date=10 December 2013 }}</ref> Larkin's mature poetic persona is notable for its "plainness and scepticism". Other recurrent features of his mature work are sudden openings and "highly-structured but flexible verse forms".<ref name="poetryarchive1"/>

[[File:Thomashardy restored.jpg|upright|right|thumb|The poetry of [[Thomas Hardy]] was the influence that helped Larkin reach his mature style.|alt=A black and white photograph of Hardy from his late middle age. He is wearing smart, formal clothes, such as a stiff collar and tie. He has a well-tended handlebar moustache]]
Terence Hawkes has argued that while most of the poems in ''The North Ship'' are "metaphoric in nature, heavily indebted to Yeats's symbolist lyrics", the subsequent development of Larkin's mature style is "not ... a movement from Yeats to Hardy, but rather a surrounding of the Yeatsian moment (the metaphor) within a Hardyesque frame". In Hawkes's view, "Larkin's poetry ... revolves around two losses": the "loss of modernism", which manifests itself as "the desire to find a moment of epiphany", and "the loss of England, or rather the loss of the British Empire, which requires England to define itself in its own terms when previously it could define 'Englishness' in opposition to something else."<ref>Hawkes 1995, p. 285.</ref>

In 1972, Larkin wrote the oft-quoted "Going, Going", a poem which expresses a romantic [[fatalism]] in its view of England that was typical of his later years. In it he prophesies a complete destruction of the countryside, and expresses an idealised sense of national togetherness and identity: "And that will be England gone&nbsp;... it will linger on in galleries; but all that remains for us will be concrete and tyres". The poem ends with the blunt statement, "I just think it will happen, soon."<ref>{{cite book

</ref>

Larkin's style is bound up with his recurring themes and subjects, which include death and fatalism, as in his final major poem "Aubade".<ref>Motion 1993, pp. 468–9.</ref> Poet [[Andrew Motion]] observes of Larkin's poems: "their rage or contempt is always checked by the ... energy of their language and the satisfactions of their articulate formal control". Motion contrasts two aspects of his poetic personality—on the one hand, an enthusiasm for "symbolist moments" and "freely imaginative narratives", and on the other a "remorseless factuality" and "crudity of language". Motion defines this as a "life-enhancing struggle between opposites", and concludes that his poetry is typically "ambivalent": "His three mature collections have developed attitudes and styles of ... imaginative daring: in their prolonged debates with despair, they testify to wide sympathies, contain passages of frequently transcendent beauty, and demonstrate a poetic inclusiveness which is of immense consequence for his literary heirs."<ref>{{cite book

Larkin was a critic of [[modernism]] in contemporary art and literature. His scepticism is at its most nuanced and illuminating in ''Required Writing'', a collection of his book reviews and essays,<ref>James 1983.</ref> and at its most inflamed and polemical in his introduction to his collected jazz reviews, ''All What Jazz'', drawn from the 126 record-review columns he wrote for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' between 1961 and 1971, which contains an attack on modern jazz that widens into a wholesale critique of modernism in the arts.<ref>{{cite journal

When first published in 1945, ''The North Ship'' received just one review, in the ''[[Coventry Evening Telegraph]]'', which concluded "Mr Larkin has an inner vision that must be sought for with care. His recondite imagery is couched in phrases that make up in a kind of wistful hinted beauty what they lack in lucidity. Mr Larkin's readers must at present be confined to a small circle. Perhaps his work will gain wider appeal as his genius becomes more mature?"<ref>Motion 1993, p. 132.</ref> A few years later, though, the poet and critic [[Charles Madge]] came across the book and wrote to Larkin with his compliments.<ref>Motion 1993, p. 191.</ref> When the collection was reissued in 1966, it was presented as a work of [[juvenilia]], and the reviews were gentle and respectful; the most forthright praise came from [[Elizabeth Jennings]] in ''[[The Spectator (1828)|The Spectator]]'': "few will question the intrinsic value of ''The North Ship'' or the importance of its being reprinted now. It is good to know that Larkin could write so well when still so young."<ref>Motion 1993, pp. 358–60.</ref>

''The Less Deceived'' was first noticed by ''[[The Times]]'', who included it in its ''List of Books of 1955''. In its wake many other reviews followed; "most of them concentrated ... on the book's emotional impact and its sophisticated, witty language."<ref name="motion269"/> ''The Spectator'' felt the collection was "in the running for the best published in this country since the war"; [[George Sutherland Fraser|G. S. Fraser]], referring to Larkin's perceived association with [[The Movement (literature)|The Movement]] felt that Larkin exemplified "everything that is good in this 'new movement' and none of its faults".<ref name=Bradford144>Bradford 2005, p. 144.</ref> ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' called him "a poet of quite exceptional importance",<ref name=Bradford144/> and in June 1956, the ''[[Times Educational Supplement]]'' was fulsome: "As native as a Whitstable oyster, as sharp an expression of contemporary thought and experience as anything written in our time, as immediate in its appeal as the lyric poetry of an earlier day, it may well be regarded by posterity as a poetic monument that marks the triumph over the formless mystifications of the last twenty years. With Larkin poetry is on its way back to the middlebrow public."<ref>Motion 1993, p. 275.</ref> Reviewing the book in America, the poet [[Robert Lowell]] wrote: "No post-war poetry has so caught the moment, and caught it without straining after its ephemera. It's a hesitant, groping mumble, resolutely experienced, resolutely perfect in its artistic methods."<ref name=Motion328>Motion 1993, p. 328.</ref>

In time, there was a counter-reaction: David Wright wrote in ''[[Encounter (magazine)|Encounter]]'' that ''The Less Deceived'' suffered from the "palsy of playing safe".<ref name=Bradford144/> In April 1957, [[Charles Tomlinson]] wrote a piece for the journal ''Essays in Criticism'', "The Middlebrow Muse", attacking The Movement's poets for their "middle-cum-lowbrowism", "suburban mental ratio" and "parochialism"—Larkin had a "tenderly nursed sense of defeat".<ref>Motion 1993, p. 281.</ref> In 1962, [[Al Alvarez|A. Alvarez]], the compiler of an anthology entitled ''[[The New Poetry]]'', accused Larkin of "gentility, neo-Georgian pastoralism, and a failure to deal with the violent extremes of contemporary life".<ref name=Motion328 />

[[File:The Arundel Tomb at Chichester Cathedral (3).JPG|right|thumb|This tomb of the [[Richard FitzAlan, 10th Earl of Arundel|Earl of Arundel]] and his wife [[Eleanor of Lancaster]] was the inspiration for Larkin's poem "[[An Arundel Tomb]]"|alt=The tomb of the Earl and Countess of Arundel in Chichester Cathedral, which is topped by a life-size sculpture of the couple. An unusual feature of the sculpture is central to Larkin's poem "An Arundel Tomb": "Such plainness of the pre-baroque / Hardly involves the eye, until / It meets his left-hand gauntlet, still / Clasped empty in the other, and / One sees, with a sharp tender shock, / His hand withdrawn, holding her hand"]]
When ''The Whitsun Weddings'' was released, Alvarez continued his attacks in a review in ''[[The Observer]]'', complaining of the "drab circumspection" of Larkin's "commonplace" subject-matter. Praise outweighed criticism; John Betjeman felt Larkin had "closed the gap between poetry and the public which the experiments and obscurity of the last fifty years have done so much to widen." In ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', [[Christopher Ricks]] wrote of the "refinement of self-consciousness, usually flawless in its execution" and Larkin's summoning up of "the world of all of us, the place where, in the end, we find our happiness, or not at all." He felt Larkin to be "the best poet England now has."<ref>Motion 1993, p. 343.</ref><ref>Bradford 2005, p.  202.</ref>

In his biography, Richard Bradford writes that the reviews for ''High Windows'' showed "genuine admiration" but notes that they typically encountered problems describing "the individual genius at work" in poems such as "Annus Mirabilis", "The Explosion" and "The Building" while also explaining why each were "so radically different" from one another. Robert Nye in ''[[The Times]]'' overcame this problem "by treating the differences as ineffective masks for a consistently nasty presence".<ref>Bradford 2005, p. 238</ref>

In ''[[Larkin at Sixty]]'',<ref name=LarkinSixty/> amongst the portraits by friends and colleagues such as Kingsley Amis, Noel Hughes and Charles Monteith and dedicatory poems by John Betjeman, [[Peter Porter (poet)|Peter Porter]] and [[Gavin Ewart]], the various strands of Larkin's output were analysed by critics and fellow poets: Andrew Motion, Christopher Ricks and [[Seamus Heaney]] looked at the poems, [[Alan Brownjohn]] wrote on the novels, and [[Donald Mitchell (writer)|Donald Mitchell]] and [[Clive James]] looked at his jazz criticism.<ref name=LarkinSixty/>

In 1980, Neil Powell wrote: "It is probably fair to say that Philip Larkin is less highly regarded in academic circles than either [[Thom Gunn]] or [[Donald Davie]]".<ref>Powell 1980, p. 83.</ref> But since the turn of the century, Larkin's standing has increased. "Philip Larkin is an excellent example of the plain style in modern times", writes Tijana Stojkovic.<ref>Stojkovic 2006, p. 37.</ref> Robert Sheppard asserts: "It is by general consent that the work of Philip Larkin is taken to be exemplary".<ref>Sheppard 2005, p. 23.</ref> "Larkin is the most widely celebrated and arguably the finest poet of the Movement", states Keith Tuma, and his poetry is "more various than its reputation for dour pessimism and anecdotes of a disappointed middle class suggests".<ref name="Tuma 2001, p. 445"/>

Stephen Cooper's ''Philip Larkin: Subversive Writer'' and John Osborne's "Larkin, Ideology and Critical Violence" suggest the changing temper of Larkin studies, the latter attacking eminent critics such as James Booth and Anthony Thwaite for their readiness to reduce the poems to works of biography, and stressing instead the genius of Larkin's universality and deconstructionism. Cooper argues that "The interplay of signs and motifs in the early work orchestrates a subversion of conventional attitudes towards class, gender, authority and sexual relations".<ref>Cooper 2004, p. 1.</ref> Cooper identifies Larkin as a progressive writer, and perceives in the letters a "plea for alternative constructs of masculinity, femininity and social and political organisation".<ref>Cooper 2004, p. 2.</ref> Cooper draws on the entire canon of Larkin's works, as well as on unpublished correspondence, to counter the image of Larkin as merely a racist, misogynist reactionary. Instead he identifies in Larkin what he calls a "subversive imagination".<ref>Cooper 2004, p. 3.</ref> He highlights in particular "Larkin's objections to the hypocrisies of conventional sexual politics that hamper the lives of both sexes in equal measure".<ref>Cooper 2004, p. 179.</ref>

In similar vein to Cooper, Stephen Regan notes in an essay entitled "Philip Larkin: a late modern poet" that Larkin frequently embraces devices associated with the experimental practices of [[Modernism]], such as "linguistic strangeness, self-conscious literariness, radical self-questioning, sudden shifts of voice and register, complex viewpoints and perspectives, and symbolist intensity".<ref>Corcoran 2007, p. 149.</ref>

A further indication of a new direction in the critical valuation of Larkin is S. K. Chatterjee's statement that "Larkin is no longer just a name but an institution, a modern British national cultural monument".<ref>Chatterjee 2007, p. 4.</ref>

Chatterjee's view of Larkin is grounded in a detailed analysis of his poetic style. He observes a development from Larkin's early works to his later ones, which sees his style change from "verbal opulence through a recognition of the self-ironising and self-negating potentiality of language to a linguistic domain where the conventionally held conceptual incompatibles – which are traditional binary oppositions between absolutes and relatives, between abstracts and concretes, between fallings and risings and between singleness and multiplicity – are found to be the last stumbling-block for an artist aspiring to rise above the impasse of worldliness".<ref>Chatterjee 2007, p. 331.</ref> This contrasts with an older view that Larkin's style barely changed over the course of his poetic career. Chatterjee identifies this view as being typified by [[Bernard Bergonzi]]'s comment that "Larkin's poetry did not ... develop between 1955 and 1974".<ref>Chatterjee 2007, p. 14.</ref> For Chatterjee, Larkin's poetry responds strongly to changing "economic, socio-political, literary and cultural factors".<ref>Chatterjee 2007, p. 18.</ref>

[[File:King Edward Street Kingston upon Hull in 1963 (2) - geograph.org.uk - 678599.jpg|right|thumb|S. K. Chatterjee talks of Larkin's responsiveness to economic, socio-political and cultural factors. In "Here" Larkin writes of "residents from raw estates, brought down / The dead straight miles by stealing flat-faced [[Trolleybuses in Kingston upon Hull|trolleys]]".|alt=Trolley buses on Hull's King Edward Street in 1963, two years after Larkin finished "Here"]]
Chatterjee argues: "It is under the defeatist veneer of his poetry that the positive side of Larkin's vision of life is hidden".<ref>Chatterjee 2007, p. 356.</ref> This positivity, suggests Chatterjee, is most apparent in his later works. Over the course of Larkin's poetic career: "The most notable attitudinal development lay in the zone of his view of life, which from being almost irredeemably bleak and pessimistic in ''The North Ship'', became more and more positive with the passage of time".<ref>Chatterjee 2007, p. 19.</ref>

The view that Larkin is not a [[nihilism|nihilist]] or [[pessimist]], but actually displays optimism in his works, is certainly not universally endorsed, but Chatterjee's study suggests the degree to which old stereotypes of Larkin are now being transcended. Representative of these stereotypes is [[Bryan Appleyard]]'s judgement (quoted by Maeve Brennan) that of the writers who "have adopted a personal pose of extreme pessimism and loathing of the world ... none has done so with quite such a grinding focus on littleness and triviality as Larkin the man".<ref name="brennan109">Brennan 2002, p. 109.</ref> Recent criticism of Larkin demonstrates a more complex set of values at work in his poetry and across the totality of his writings.<ref>Ingelbien 2002, p. 13.</ref>

The debate about Larkin is summed up by Matthew Johnson, who observes that in most evaluations of Larkin "one is not really discussing the man, but actually reading a coded and implicit discussion of the supposed values of 'Englishness' that he is held to represent".<ref>Johnson 2007, p. 66.</ref> Changing attitudes to Englishness are reflected in changing attitudes to Larkin, and the more sustained intellectual interest in the English national character, as embodied in the works of [[Peter Mandler]] for instance, pinpoint one key reason why there is an increased scholarly interest in Larkin.<ref>Ingelbien 2002, p. 196.</ref>

A summative view similar to those of Johnson and Regan is that of Robert Crawford, who argues that "In various ways, Larkin's work depends on, and develops from, Modernism." Furthermore, he "demonstrates just how slippery the word 'English' is".<ref>Crawford 2000, p. 276.</ref>

Despite these recent developments, Larkin and his circle are nonetheless still firmly rejected by modernist critics and poets. For example, the poet [[Andrew Duncan (poet)|Andrew Duncan]], writing of [[The Movement (literature)|The Movement]] on his pinko.org website,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soton.ac.uk/~bepc/poets/duncan.htm |title=Biography of Andrew Duncan |publisher=Soton.ac.uk |date=12 February 2004 |access-date=15 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001022115/http://www.soton.ac.uk/~bepc/poets/duncan.htm |archive-date=1 October 2009  }}</ref> is of the opinion that "there now seems to be a very wide consensus that it was a bad thing, and that Movement poems are tedious, shallow, smug, sententious, emotionally dead, etc. Their successors in the mainstream retain most of these characteristics. Wolfgang Gortschacher's book on Little Magazine Profiles ... shows ... that there was a terrific dearth of magazines during the 50s—an impoverishment of openings which correlates with rigid and conservative poetry, and with the hegemony of a few people determined to exclude dissidents."<ref>Notes on the poetry of the 1940s: [http://www.pinko.org/108.html Pinko.org] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706092047/http://www.pinko.org/108.html |date=6 July 2008 }}</ref> [[Peter Riley]], a participant in the [[British Poetry Revival]], which was a reaction against The Movement's poets, has also criticised Larkin for his uncritical and ideologically narrow position: "What after all were Larkin and The Movement but a denial of the effusive ethics of poetry from 1795 onwards, in favour of 'This is what life is really like' as if anyone thought for a second of representing observable 'life'. [[W.S. Graham]] and [[Dylan Thomas]] knew perfectly well that 'life' was like that, if you nominated it thus, which is why they went elsewhere."<ref>{{cite web

===Posthumous reputation===
{{further|Selected Letters of Philip Larkin, 1940–1985}}
Larkin's posthumous reputation was deeply affected by the publication in 1992 of [[Anthony Thwaite]]'s edition of his letters and, the following year, his official biography, ''Philip Larkin: A Writer's Life'' by [[Andrew Motion]].<ref>{{cite web

</ref> These revealed his obsession with [[Pornographic magazine|pornography]], his [[racism]], his increasing shift to the political [[right wing]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2013/dec/07/dinner-with-margaret-thatcher-literary |title=Dinner with Margaret Thatcher: the story of a secret supper |last1=Farndale |first1=Nigel |author-link=Nigel Farndale |date=7 December 2013 |website=[[The Observer]] |access-date=7 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208110138/http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2013/dec/07/dinner-with-margaret-thatcher-literary |archive-date=8 December 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> and his habitual expressions of venom and spleen. In 1990, even before the publication of these two books, [[Tom Paulin]] wrote that Larkin's "obscenity is informed by prejudices that are not by any means as ordinary, commonplace, or acceptable as the poetic language in which they are so plainly spelled out."<ref>Paulin 1990.</ref> The letters and Motion's biography fuelled further assessments of this kind, such as [[Lisa Jardine]]'s comment in ''The Guardian'' that "The Britishness of Larkin's poetry carries a baggage of attitudes which the ''Selected Letters'' now make explicit".<ref name="brennan109"/> On the other hand, the revelations were dismissed by the novelist [[Martin Amis]] in ''[[The War Against Cliché]]'', arguing that the letters in particular show nothing more than a tendency for Larkin to tailor his words according to the recipient. A similar argument was made by Richard Bradford in his biography on Larkin from 2005.<ref>Bradford 2005, pp. 210 & 224.</ref><ref>Motion 1993, p. 332.</ref> Commenting on ''Letters to Monica''
(2010) Graeme Richardson states that the collection went "some way towards the restoration of Larkin's tarnished image...reveal(ing) Larkin as not quite the sinister, black-hearted near-rapist everyone thought it was OK to abuse in the 90s."<ref>Richardson, G. "Larkin the Porn Star Poet", ''Areté'' 33, Winter 2010, pp. 77–90.</ref>

Trying to resolve Larkin's contradictory opinions on race in his book ''Such Deliberate Disguises: The Art of Philip Larkin'', the writer Richard Palmer quotes a letter Larkin wrote to Betjeman, as if it exposes "all the post-Motion and post-Letters furore about Larkin’s 'racism' as the nonsense it is":

<blockquote>The American Negro is trying to take a step forward that can be compared only to the ending of slavery in the nineteenth century. And despite the dogs, the hosepipes and the burnings, advances have already been made towards giving the Negro his civil rights that would have been inconceivable when [[Louis Armstrong]] was a young man. These advances will doubtless continue. They will end only when the Negro is as well-housed, educated and medically cared for as the white man.</blockquote>

Reviewing Palmer's book, John G. Rodwan, Jr. proposes that:

<blockquote>a less forgiving reader could counter by asking if this does not qualify as the thought of a "true racist": <blockquote>I find the state of the nation quite terrifying. In 10 years' time we shall all be cowering under our beds as hordes of blacks steal anything they can lay their hands on.</blockquote> Or this: <blockquote>We don’t go to [[cricket]] [[Test cricket|Test matches]] now, too many fucking niggers about.<ref>{{cite web

In 1959, the Marvell Press published ''Listen presents Philip Larkin reading The Less Deceived'' (Listen LPV1), an LP record on which Larkin recites all the poems from ''The Less Deceived'' in the order they appear in the printed volume.<ref>Bloomfield 2002, p. 140.</ref> This was followed, in 1965, by ''Philip Larkin reads and comments on The Whitsun Weddings'' (Listen LPV6), again on the Marvell Press's record label (though the printed volume was published by Faber and Faber). Once again the poems are read in the order in which they appear in the printed volume, but with Larkin including introductory remarks to many of the poems.<ref name="Bloomfield 2002, p. 141">Bloomfield 2002, p. 141.</ref> A recording of Larkin reading the poems from his final collection, ''High Windows'', was published in 1975 as ''British poets of our time. Philip Larkin; High Windows: poems read by the author'' (edited by Peter Orr) on the Argo record label (Argo PLP 1202).<ref name="Bloomfield 2002, p. 142">Bloomfield 2002, p. 142.</ref> As with the two previous recordings, the sequencing of the poems is the same as in the printed volume.

Larkin also appears on several audio poetry anthologies: ''The Jupiter Anthology of 20th Century English Poetry – Part III'' (JUR 00A8), issued in 1963 and featuring "An Arundel Tomb" and "Mr Bleaney" (this same recording was issued in the United States in 1967 on the Folkways record label as ''Anthology of 20th Century English Poetry – Part III'' (FL9870));<ref name="Bloomfield 2002, p. 141"/> ''The Poet Speaks'' record 8 (Argo PLP 1088), issued in 1967 and featuring "Wants", "Coming", "Nothing to be Said", "Days" and "Dockery and Son";<ref name="Bloomfield 2002, p. 141"/> ''On Record'' (YA3), issued in 1974 by Yorkshire Arts Association and featuring "Here", "Days", "Next, Please", "Wedding-Wind", "The Whitsun Weddings", "XXX", "XIII" (these last two poems from ''The North Ship'');<ref name="Bloomfield 2002, p. 141"/> and ''Douglas Dunn and Philip Larkin'', issued in 1984 by Faber and Faber (A Faber Poetry cassette), featuring Larkin reading 13 poems including, for the first time on a recording, "Aubade".<ref name="Bloomfield 2002, p. 142"/>

Despite the fact that Larkin made audio recordings (in studio conditions) of each of his three mature collections, and separate recordings of  groups of poems for a number of audio anthologies, he somehow gained a reputation as a poet who was reluctant to make recordings in which he read his own work.<ref name="The Larkin Tapes">{{cite episode

</ref> the evidence indicates that this influenced more his preference not to give public readings of his own work, than his willingness to make audio recordings of his poems.
