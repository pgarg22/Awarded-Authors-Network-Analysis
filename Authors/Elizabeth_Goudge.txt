'''Elizabeth de Beauchamp Goudge''' [[FRSL]] (24 April 1900 – 1 April 1984) was an English writer of fiction and [[children's book]]s. She won the [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] for British children's books in 1946 for ''[[The Little White Horse]]''.<ref name=medal1946/> Goudge was long a popular author in the UK and the US and regained attention decades later. In 1993 her book ''The Rosemary Tree'' was plagiarised by [[Indrani Aikath-Gyaltsen]]; the "new" novel set in India was warmly reviewed in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' before its source was discovered.<ref name=moore/> In 2001 or 2002 [[J. K. Rowling]] identified ''The Little White Horse'' as one of her favourite books and one of few with a direct influence on the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series.<ref name=fraser1/><ref name=fraser2/>

==Biography==
===Personal life===
Goudge was born on 24 April 1900 in Tower House in The Liberty of the cathedral city of [[Wells, Somerset|Wells]], where her father, Henry Leighton Goudge, was vice-principal of the [[Sarum College#Merger|Theological College]]. Her mother (born Ida de Beauchamp Collenette 1874: died 4 May 1951, aged 77) was originally from [[Guernsey]]. Ida met Henry while on holiday from there. The family moved to [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]], when he became principal of the Theological College, and then to [[Christ Church, Oxford]], when he was appointed [[Regius Professorships|Regius Professor]] of Divinity at [[University of Oxford|the University]]. Elizabeth was educated at Grassendale School, [[Southbourne, West Sussex|Southbourne]] (1914–1918) and the art school of [[Reading University|University College Reading]], then an extension college of Christ Church. She went on to teach design and handicrafts in Ely and Oxford.<ref>D. L. Kirkpatrick, ed., ''Twentieth-Century Children's Writers'', 2nd ed., London, 1983, pp. 324–325. {{ISBN|0-912289-45-7}}</ref>

After her father's death in 1939, Goudge and her mother moved into a bungalow in [[Marldon]], [[Devon]]. They had planned only a vacation there, but the outbreak of the Second World War led them to remain. A local contractor built them a bungalow in Westerland Lane, now Providence Cottage, where they lived for 12 years and Goudge wrote several books with Marldon as a setting: ''Smoky House'' (1940), ''The Castle on the Hill'' (1941), ''Green Dolphin Country'' (1944), ''The Little White Horse'' (1946) and ''Gentian Hill'' (1949).<ref>{{Cite news |title=Elizabeth Goudge, her time in Marldon |url=http://www.marldonhistory.co.uk/html/elizabeth_goudge.html |access-date=6 August 2017 |work=Marldon Local History Group: Life in a Devon Parish}}</ref> After her mother's death in 1951, she moved to [[Oxfordshire]], spending the last 30 years of her life in a cottage on [[Rotherfield Peppard|Peppard Common]] outside [[Henley-on-Thames]], where a [[blue plaque]] was unveiled in 2008.<ref>[http://oxonblueplaques.org.uk/plaques/goudge.html "Elizabeth GOUDGE (1900–1984)"]. Oxfordshire Blue Plaques Scheme.</ref>

Elizabeth Goudge died on 1 April 1984.<ref>Obituaries: ''The Times'', 3 April 1984; ''The New York Times'' 27 April 1984.</ref>

===Writing career===
Goudge's first book, ''The Fairies' Baby and Other Stories'' (1919), failed to sell, and it was several years before she wrote her first novel, ''[[Island Magic]]'' (1934), which was an immediate success. It was based on [[Channel Island]] stories, many of them learned from her mother, a native of [[Guernsey]]. Elizabeth regularly visited Guernsey as a child, and recalled in her autobiography ''[[The Joy of the Snow]]'' spending many summers with her maternal grandparents and relatives.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Goudge |first=Elizabeth |title=The Joy of the Snow |year=1974 |publisher=Coward, McCann & Geoghegan |isbn=978-0-698-10605-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/joyofsnow00goud}}</ref>

For ''[[The Little White Horse]]'', published by the University of London Press in 1946, Goudge won the annual [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] from the [[CILIP|Library Association]], recognising the year's best children's book by a [[British subject]].<ref name=medal1946/> It was her own favourite among her works.<ref>John Attenborough, "Goudge, Elizabeth de Beauchamp (1900–1984)", revised by Victoria Millar, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004.

Goudge was a founding member of the [[Romantic Novelists' Association]] in 1960 and later its vice-president.<ref name=RNA>[http://www.romanticnovelistsassociation.org/index.php/about/our_story "Our story"] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022143448/http://www.romanticnovelistsassociation.org/index.php/about/our_story |date=22 October 2012}}.

===Themes===
Goudge's books are notably Christian in outlook, covering sacrifice, conversion, discipline, healing, and growth through suffering. Her novels, whether realistic, fantasy, or historical, interweave legend and myth and reflect a spirituality and deep love of England that pervade her work and generate its appeal, whether she was writing for adults or for children.

Goudge said there were only three of her books that she loved: ''The Valley of Song'', ''The Dean's Watch'' and ''The Child from the Sea'', her final novel.<ref>Elizabeth Goudge, ''The Joy of the Snow'', [[Coronet]], [[Sevenoaks]], 1977, pp. 256–259.</ref> Of ''The Child from the Sea'' she said:
<blockquote>I doubt if it is a good book, nevertheless I love it because its theme is forgiveness, the grace that seems to me divine above all others, and the most desperate need of all us tormented and tormenting human beings, and also because I seemed to give to it all I have to give; very little, heaven knows. And so I know I can never write another novel, for I do not think there is anything else to say.<ref>Elizabeth Goudge, ''The Joy of the Snow'', p. 259.</ref></blockquote>

===Plagiarism of Goudge's work===
{{one source section|date=December 2020}}
Early in 1993, ''[[Cranes' Morning]]'' by [[Indrani Aikath-Gyaltsen]] was published by [[Penguin Books]] in India, the author's second novel.<ref name=moore/> In the U.S. it was published by [[Ballantine Books]], and enthusiastically reviewed for ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]''. For the ''Post'', Paul Kafka called it "at once achingly familiar and breathtakingly new. [The author] believes we all live in one borderless culture." In February, the ''Times'' called it "magic" and "full of humour and insight", although it conceded that the "deliberately old-fashioned" style "sometimes verges on the sentimental."<ref name=moore/>

One month later, a reader from Ontario informed Hodder and Stoughton, publisher of Goudge's book ''The Rosemary Tree'' in 1956, that it had been "taken over without any acknowledgment whatsoever". Soon another reader informed a newspaper reporter and there was a scandal.<ref name=moore/>

When ''The Rosemary Tree'' was first published in 1956, ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' criticized its "slight plot" and "sentimentally ecstatic" approach. After Aikath-Gyaltsen recast the setting to an [[India]]n village, changing the names and switching the religion to [[Hindu]] but often keeping the story word-for-word the same, it received better notices.<ref name=moore/>

Kafka later remarked about his ''Post'' review: "there's a phrase 'aesthetic [[affirmative action]].' If something comes from exotic parts, it's read very differently than if it's domestically grown... Maybe Elizabeth Goudge is a writer who hasn't gotten her due."<ref name=moore/>

Several months later, Indrani Aikath-Gyaltsen was dead, perhaps from suicide, but there were requests for investigation.<ref name=moore/>

===Influence===
[[J. K. Rowling]], the creator of Harry Potter, has recalled that ''The Little White Horse'' was her favourite book as a child. She has also identified it as one of very few with "direct influence on the Harry Potter books. The author always included details of what her characters were eating and I remember liking that. You may have noticed that I always list the food being eaten at Hogwarts."<ref name=fraser1>''Conversations with J.K. Rowling'', Linda Fraser, Scholastic, 2001, {{ISBN|978-0439314558}}. p. 24.</ref><ref name=fraser2>[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2002/1102-fraser-scotsman.html "Harry Potter – Harry and me"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205213016/http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2002/1102-fraser-scotsman.html |date=5 February 2012 }}, Lindsay Fraser's interview with J. K. Rowling from ''The Scotsman'', November 2002. <br>. Retrieved 13 May 2013.</ref>

===Adaptations===
''Green Dolphin Country'' (1944) was [[film adaptation|adapted as a film]] under its U.S. title, ''[[Green Dolphin Street (film)|Green Dolphin Street]]'', and the movie won the [[Academy Award]] for Special Effects in 1948. (The special effects involved the depiction of a major earthquake.)

The television mini-series ''[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0305072/ Moonacre]'' and the 2009 film ''The Secret of Moonacre'' were based on ''The Little White Horse''.
