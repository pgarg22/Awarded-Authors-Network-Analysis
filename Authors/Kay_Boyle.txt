'''Kay Boyle''' (February 19, 1902 – December 27, 1992) was an American novelist, short story writer, educator, and political activist.<ref name=obit/> She was a [[Guggenheim Fellow]] and [[O. Henry Award]] winner.

==Early years==
The granddaughter of a publisher, Boyle was born in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]], and grew up in several cities but principally in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]. Her father, Howard Peterson Boyle, was a lawyer, but her greatest influence came from her mother, Katherine Evans, a literary and social activist who believed that the wealthy had an obligation to help the financially less fortunate. In later years Kay Boyle championed integration and civil rights. She advocated banning nuclear weapons, and American withdrawal from the [[Vietnam War]].<ref name=obit/>

Boyle was educated at the exclusive [[The Shipley School|Shipley School]] in [[Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania]], then studied architecture at the [[University of Cincinnati College of Applied Science|Ohio Mechanics Institute]] in Cincinnati. Interested in the arts,  she studied violin at the [[Cincinnati Conservatory of Music]] before settling in [[New York City]] in 1922 where she found work as a writer/editor with a small magazine.<ref name=obit/>

==Marriages and family life==
That same year, she met and married a French exchange student, Richard Brault, and they moved to France in 1923. This resulted in her staying in Europe for the better part of the next twenty years. Separated from her husband, she formed a relationship with magazine editor Ernest Walsh, with whom she had a daughter, Sharon, named for the [[Rose of Sharon]], in March 1927, five months after Walsh's death from tuberculosis in October 1926.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Kay Boyle: A Twentieth-Century Life in Letters|last=Spanier|first=Sandra|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2015|location=Urbana|pages=Iiii}}</ref>

In 1928 she met Laurence Vail, who was then married to [[Peggy Guggenheim]]. Boyle and Vail lived together between 1929 until 1932 when, following their divorces, they married. With Vail, she had three more children - daughters Apple-Joan in 1929, Kathe in 1934, and Clover in 1939.<ref name=":0" /> During her years in France, Boyle was associated with several innovative literary magazines and made friends with many of the writers and artists living in Paris around [[Montparnasse]]. Among her friends were [[Harry Crosby|Harry]] and [[Caresse Crosby]] who owned the [[Black Sun Press]] and published her first work of fiction, a collection titled ''Short Stories''. They became such good friends that in 1928 Harry Crosby cashed in some stock dividends to help Boyle pay for an abortion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/Maps/poets/a_f/crosby/remembering.htm|title=Remembering Harry Crosby: Kay Boyle, John Wheelwright|access-date=March 18, 2010}}</ref> Other friends included [[Eugene Jolas|Eugene]] and [[Maria Jolas]]. Boyle also wrote for ''[[Transition (literary journal)|transition]]'', one of the preeminent literary publications of the day. A poet as well as a novelist, her early writings often reflected her lifelong search for true love as well as her interest in the power relationships between men and women. Boyle's short stories won two [[O. Henry Awards]].

In 1936, she wrote a novel, [http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/793241.Death_of_a_Man ''Death of a Man''], an attack on the growing threat of [[Nazism]]. In 1943, following her divorce from Laurence Vail, she married [[Joseph Freiherr von Franckenstein|Baron Joseph von Franckenstein]], with whom she had two children - Faith in 1942 and Ian in 1943.<ref name=":0" /> After having lived in France, Austria, England, and in Germany after [[World War II]], Boyle returned to the United States.<ref name=obit/>

==McCarthyism, later life==
In the States, Boyle and her husband were victims of early 1950s [[McCarthyism]]. Her husband was dismissed by [[Roy Cohn]] from his post in the Public Affairs Division of the [[United States Department of State]], and Boyle lost her position as foreign correspondent for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', a post she had held for six years. She was [[blacklist]]ed by most of the major magazines. During this period, her life and writing became increasingly political.

She and her husband were cleared by the [[United States Department of State]] in 1957.<ref>{{cite news |title=State Department Wipes Out Findings Against Novelist Kay Boyle and Husband |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C00E3D61330E23BBC4A51DFB266838C649EDE |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=April 22, 1957 |access-date=2016-05-30 }}</ref>

In the early 1960s, Boyle and her husband lived in [[Rowayton, Connecticut]], where he taught at a private girls' school.  He was then rehired by the [[State Department]] and posted to [[Iran]], but died shortly thereafter in 1963.

Boyle was a writer in residence at the New York City Writer's Conference at [[Wagner College]] in 1962. In 1963, she accepted a creative writing position on the faculty of [[San Francisco State University|San Francisco State College]], where she remained until 1979.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/MAPS/poets/a_f/boyle/bio.htm|title=Kay Boyle Biography|access-date=August 28, 2015}}</ref>

During this period she became heavily involved in political activism. She traveled to [[Cambodia]] in 1966 as part of the "Americans Want to Know" fact-seeking mission. She participated in numerous protests, and in 1967 was arrested twice and imprisoned. In 1968, she signed the "[[Writers and Editors War Tax Protest]]" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.<ref>[http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/Weisberg%20Subject%20Index%20Files/W%20Disk/Writers%20and%20Editors%20Protest/Item%2002.pdf ''Writers and Editors War Tax Protest'']  page 2.</ref> In her later years, she became an active supporter of [[Amnesty International]] and worked for the [[NAACP]]. After retiring from San Francisco State College, Boyle held several writer-in-residence positions for brief periods of time, including at [[Eastern Washington University]] in [[Cheney, Washington|Cheney]] and the [[University of Oregon]] in [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Boyle died at a [[retirement community]] in [[Mill Valley, California]] on December 27, 1992.<ref name=obit>{{cite news |author=Eric Pace |author-link=Eric Pace |title=Kay Boyle, 90, Writer of Novels and Stories, Dies |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/29/arts/kay-boyle-90-writer-of-novels-and-stories-dies.html |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=December 29, 1992 |access-date=2016-05-30 }}</ref>

==Legacy==
In her lifetime Kay Boyle published more than 40 books, including 14 novels, eight volumes of [[poetry]], 11 collections of short fiction, three children's books, and French to English translations and essays. Most of her papers and manuscripts are in the Morris Library at [[Southern Illinois University]] in [[Carbondale, Illinois]]. Morris Library has the [[Ruby Cohn]] Collection of Kay Boyle Letters and the [[Erich Kahler|Alice L. Kahler]] Collection of Kay Boyle Letters.<ref>[http://archives.lib.siu.edu/?p=collections/controlcard&id=2313 Kay Boyle Letters at Morris Library, Southern Illinois University]</ref> A comprehensive assessment of Boyle's life and work was published in 1986 titled ''Kay Boyle, Artist and Activist'' by Sandra Whipple Spanier.
