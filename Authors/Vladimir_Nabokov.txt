===Russia===
Nabokov was born on 22 April 1899 (10 April 1899 [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|Old Style]]) in [[Saint Petersburg]]{{efn|name=note1}} to a wealthy and prominent family of the Russian nobility. His family traced its roots to the 14th-century [[Tatar people|Tatar]] prince Nabok [[Morza|Murza]], who entered into the service of the Tsars, and from whom the family name is derived.<ref>{{cite book| first= Vladimir Vladimirovich |last= Nabokov| title= Speak, Memory: A Memoir| publisher= Gollancz |year= 1951| page= 37}}</ref><ref name= RussianYears />{{rp|16}}<ref>{{cite book| first= Barbara |last= Wyllie| title= Vladimir Nabokov| url= https://archive.org/details/vladimirnabokov00barb | url-access= limited | publisher= Reaktion Books |year= 2010| page= [https://archive.org/details/vladimirnabokov00barb/page/n8 7]|isbn= 9781861896605}}</ref> His father was [[Vladimir Dmitrievich Nabokov]] (1870–1922), a liberal lawyer, statesman, and journalist, and his mother was the heiress Yelena Ivanovna ''née'' Rukavishnikova, the granddaughter of a millionaire [[gold-mine]] owner. His father was a leader of the pre-Revolutionary liberal [[Constitutional Democratic Party]], and wrote numerous books and articles about criminal law and politics.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Vladimir-Nabokov|title=Vladimir Nabokov {{!}} American author| encyclopedia= [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |access-date=3 May 2016}}</ref> His cousins included the composer [[Nicolas Nabokov]]. His paternal grandfather, Dmitry Nabokov (1827–1904), was Russia's Justice Minister during the reign of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]. His paternal grandmother was the [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German]] [[Baroness]] Maria von Korff (1842–1926). Through his father's German ancestry, Nabokov was related to the composer [[Carl Heinrich Graun]] (1704–1759).<ref>{{cite book| first= Vincent |last= Giroud| title= Nicolas Nabokov: A Life in Freedom and Music| publisher= Oxford University Press |year= 2015| page= 2}}</ref>

Vladimir was the family's eldest and favorite child, with four younger siblings: [[Sergey Nabokov|Sergey]] (1900–45), Olga (1903–78), Elena (1906–2000), and Kirill (1912–64). Sergey was killed in a Nazi concentration camp in 1945 after publicly denouncing Hitler's regime. Writer [[Ayn Rand]] recalled Olga (her close friend at Stoiunina Gymnasium) as a supporter of constitutional monarchy who first awakened Rand's interest in politics.<ref>{{Citation | last = Sciabarra | first = Chris Matthew | title = Ayn Rand: The Russian Radical | publisher = Penn State Press | year = 2013 | pages = 66, 367–68}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | last = Gladstein | first = Mimi Reisel | year = 2009 | title = Ayn Rand | series = Major Conservative and Libertarian Thinkers | place = New York | publisher = Continuum | isbn = 978-0-8264-4513-1 | page = 2}}.</ref> Elena, who in later years became Vladimir's favorite sibling, published her correspondence with him in 1985. She was an important source for later biographers of Nabokov.

Nabokov spent his childhood and youth in Saint Petersburg and at the country estate ''Vyra'' near [[Siverskaya]], south of the city. His childhood, which he called "perfect" and "cosmopolitan", was remarkable in several ways. The family spoke Russian, English, and French in their household, and Nabokov was trilingual from an early age. He related that the first English book his mother read to him was ''Misunderstood'' (1869) by [[Florence Montgomery]]. Much to his patriotic father's disappointment, Nabokov could read and write in English before he could in Russian. In his memoir ''[[Speak, Memory]]'', Nabokov recalls numerous details of his privileged childhood. His ability to recall in vivid detail memories of his past was a boon to him during his permanent exile, providing a theme that runs from his first book ''[[Mary (novel)|Mary]]'' to later works such as ''[[Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle]]''. While the family was nominally [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]], it had little religious fervor. Vladimir was not forced to attend church after he lost interest.

In 1916, Nabokov inherited the estate [[Rozhdestveno Memorial Estate|Rozhdestveno]], next to Vyra, from his uncle Vasily Ivanovich Rukavishnikov ("Uncle Ruka" in ''Speak, Memory''). He lost it in the [[October Revolution]] one year later; this was the only house he ever owned.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Nabokov's adolescence was the period in which he made his first serious literary endeavors. In 1916, he published his first book, ''Stikhi'' ("Poems"), a collection of 68 Russian poems. At the time he was attending Tenishev school in Saint Petersburg, where his literature teacher Vladimir Vasilievich Gippius had criticized his literary accomplishments. Some time after the publication of ''Stikhi'', [[Zinaida Gippius]], renowned poet and first cousin of his teacher, told Nabokov's father at a social event, "Please tell your son that he will never be a writer."<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://revel.unice.fr/cycnos/?id=1453|journal=Cycnos |title=Nabokov and Some Poets of Russian Modernism| date=2008-06-25| volume= NABOKOV : At the Crossroads of Modernism and Postmodernism -| access-date= 5 December 2015| last1= Karlinsky| first1= Simon}}</ref>

===Emigration===
After the 1917 [[February Revolution]], Nabokov's father became a secretary of the [[Russian Provisional Government]] in Saint Petersburg. After the October Revolution, the family was forced to flee the city for Crimea, at first not expecting to be away for very long. They lived at a friend's estate and in September 1918 moved to [[Livadiya, Crimea|Livadiya]], at the time part of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic|Ukrainian Republic]]. Nabokov's father became a minister of justice in the [[Crimean Regional Government]].

After the withdrawal of the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] in November 1918 and the defeat of the [[White Army]] (early 1919), the Nabokovs sought exile in western Europe, along with many other Russian refugees. They settled briefly in [[England]], where Vladimir read zoology and later [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] and [[Romance languages]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. His examination results on the first part of the [[Tripos]], taken at the end of his second year, were a [[starred first]]. He sat the second part of the exam in his fourth year, just after his father's death. Nabokov feared he might fail the exam, but his script was marked [[Second class honours|second-class]]. His final examination result was second-class, and his BA conferred in 1922. Nabokov later drew on his Cambridge experiences to write several works, including the novels ''[[Glory (novel)|Glory]]'' and ''[[The Real Life of Sebastian Knight]]''.

In 1920, Nabokov's family moved to Berlin, where his father set up the émigré newspaper ''Rul''' ("Rudder"). Nabokov followed them to Berlin two years later, after completing his studies at Cambridge.

===Berlin years (1922–37)===
In March 1922, Nabokov's father was fatally shot in Berlin by Russian monarchists [[Pyotr Shabelsky-Bork]] and [[Sergey Taboritsky]] as he was trying to shield the real target, [[Pavel Milyukov]], a leader of the [[Constitutional Democratic Party]]-in-exile. Nabokov featured this mistaken, violent death repeatedly in his fiction, where characters would meet their deaths under accidental terms. (On one interpretation of his novel ''[[Pale Fire]]'', for example, an assassin mistakenly kills the poet John Shade when his actual target is a fugitive European monarch.) Shortly after his father's death, Nabokov's mother and sister moved to Prague.

Nabokov stayed in Berlin, where he had become a recognised poet and writer in Russian within the émigré community; he published under the ''nom de plume'' ''V. Sirin'' (a reference to the [[sirin|fabulous bird]] of Russian folklore). To supplement his scant writing income, he taught languages and gave tennis and boxing lessons.<ref name="MA"/> Of his 15 Berlin years, Dieter E. Zimmer has written: "He never became fond of Berlin, and at the end intensely disliked it. He lived within the lively Russian community of Berlin that was more or less self-sufficient, staying on after it had disintegrated because he had nowhere else to go to. He knew little German. He knew few Germans except for landladies, shopkeepers, and immigration officials at the police headquarters."<ref>{{cite web| last = Zimmer | first = Dieter E | url = http://www.d-e-zimmer.de/Root/nabberlin2002.htm | title = Presentation of the book ''Nabokov's Berlin'' | series = The International Vladimir Nabokov Symposium | publisher = St. Petersburg | date = 15 July 2002}}.</ref>

In 1922, Nabokov became engaged to Svetlana Siewert; she broke off the engagement in early 1923, her parents worrying that he could not provide for her.<ref>{{cite news| url= https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/s/schiff-vera.html | work= The New York Times |title= Vera, chapter 1, para 6 |first= Stacy|last=Schiff}}</ref> In May 1923, he met [[Véra Evseyevna Slonim]], a Russian-Jewish woman,<!-- do not put ethnicity first --> at a charity ball in Berlin.<ref name= "MA">{{Citation | author-link = Martin Amis| last = Amis | first = Martin | title = Visiting Mrs Nabokov: And Other Excursions | pages = 115–18 | publisher = [[Penguin Books]] | orig-year = 1993 | edition = reprint | year = 1994 | isbn = 978-0-14-023858-7| title-link = Visiting Mrs Nabokov: And Other Excursions }}.</ref> They married in April 1925.<ref name="MA"/> Their only child, [[Dmitri Nabokov|Dmitri]], was born in 1934.

In the course of 1936, Véra lost her job because of the increasingly anti-Semitic environment; Sergey Taboritsky was appointed deputy head of Germany's Russian-émigré bureau; and Nabokov began seeking a job in the English-speaking world. In 1937, he left Germany for France, where he had a short affair with Irina Guadanini, also a Russian émigrée. His family followed him to France, making en route their last visit to Prague, then spent time in [[Cannes]], [[Menton]], [[Cap d'Antibes]], and [[Fréjus]], finally settling in Paris. This city also had a Russian émigré community.

In 1939, in Paris, Nabokov wrote the 55-page novella ''[[The Enchanter]]'', his final work of Russian fiction.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Heinegg|first=Peter|date=September 18, 1986|title=The Enchanter by Vladimir Nabokov; translated by Dmitri Navokov|work=Los Angeles Times|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-09-28-bk-9567-story.html}}</ref> He later called it "the first little throb of ''Lolita''."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Cahill|first=Sarah|date=1987-07-09|title=Reading: The First Throb of Lolita|url=http://chicagoreader.com/news-politics/reading-the-first-throb-of-lolita/|access-date=2021-09-03|website=Chicago Reader|language=en-US}}</ref> 

In May 1940, the Nabokovs fled the advancing German troops, reaching the United States via the [[SS Champlain|SS ''Champlain'']]. Nabokov's brother Sergei did not leave France, and he died at the [[Neuengamme concentration camp]] on 9 January 1945.<ref>{{Citation | first = Lev | last = Grossman | url = http://www.salon.com/2000/05/17/nabokov_5/ | title = The gay Nabokov | newspaper = Salon | date = 18 May 2000 | access-date = 8 December 2013}}.</ref>

===United States===
[[File:957 East State St Ithaca NY NabokovHome1953.jpg|thumb|957 East State St., Ithaca, New York, where Nabokov lived with his family in 1947 and again in 1953 while teaching at [[Cornell University]]. Here he finished ''Lolita'' and started writing ''Pnin''.]]

The Nabokovs settled in Manhattan and Vladimir began volunteer work as an [[entomologist]] at the [[American Museum of Natural History]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Nabokov's Type: Lysandra cormion|url=http://www-v1.amnh.org/news/tag/vladimir-nabokov/|access-date=18 April 2013}}</ref>

Nabokov joined the staff of [[Wellesley College]] in 1941 as resident lecturer in comparative literature. The position, created specifically for him, provided an income and free time to write creatively and pursue his [[lepidoptery]]. Nabokov is remembered as the founder of Wellesley's Russian Department. The Nabokovs resided in [[Wellesley, Massachusetts]], during the 1941–42 academic year. In September 1942 they moved to nearby [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], where they lived until June 1948. Following a lecture tour through the United States, Nabokov returned to Wellesley for the 1944–45 academic year as a lecturer in Russian. In 1945, he became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States. He served through the 1947–48 term as Wellesley's one-man Russian Department, offering courses in Russian language and literature. His classes were popular, due as much to his unique teaching style as to the wartime interest in all things Russian.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} At the same time he was the ''de facto'' curator of lepidoptery at [[Harvard University]]'s [[Museum of Comparative Zoology]].<ref>{{cite news| title= Nabokov, Scientist| work= Natural History| date= July 1999}}</ref> After being encouraged by [[Morris Bishop]], Nabokov left Wellesley in 1948 to teach Russian and European literature at [[Cornell University]] in [[Ithaca, New York]], where he taught until 1959. Among his students at Cornell was future [[U.S. Supreme Court]] [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], who later identified Nabokov as a major influence on her development as a writer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lawprose.org/interviews/supreme-court.php?vid=ginsburg_part_1&vidtitle=Associate_Justice_Ruth_Bader_Ginsburg_Part_1|title=Supreme Court Interviews | website= LawProse.org|access-date=5 December 2015}}</ref>

Nabokov wrote ''[[Lolita]]'' while travelling on the butterfly-collection trips in the western United States that he undertook every summer. Véra acted as "secretary, typist, editor, proofreader, translator and bibliographer; his agent, business manager, legal counsel and chauffeur; his research assistant, teaching assistant and professorial understudy"; when Nabokov attempted to burn unfinished drafts of ''Lolita'', Véra stopped him. He called her the best-humored woman he had ever known.<ref name="MA"/><ref>{{cite news| work= The New York Times| url= https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/11/obituaries/vera-nabokov-89-wife-muse-and-agent.html |title= Vera Nabokov, 89, Wife, Muse and Agent| date= 11 April 1991}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| first= Brian |last= Boyd| title= Vladimir Nabokov: The American Years| pages= 170, 601}}</ref>

In June 1953 Nabokov and his family went to [[Ashland, Oregon]]. There he finished ''Lolita'' and began writing the novel ''[[Pnin]]''. He roamed the nearby mountains looking for butterflies, and wrote a poem called ''Lines Written in Oregon''. On 1 October 1953, he and his family returned to Ithaca, where he would later teach the young writer [[Thomas Pynchon]].<ref name="medfordmail">{{cite news| url-status= dead| url= http://archive.mailtribune.com/archive/99/sept99/92299n2.htm |title= Snapshot: Nabokov's Retreat| place= Ashland, Oregon | work= [[Mail Tribune]] (Medford, Oregon)| date= 5 November 2006| page= 2 |first= Dani| last= Dodge |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101202051944/http://archive.mailtribune.com/archive/99/sept99/92299n2.htm |archive-date= 2 December 2010 | access-date= 9 August 2018}}</ref>

After the great financial success of ''Lolita'', Nabokov returned to Europe and devoted himself to writing. In 1961 he and Véra moved to the [[Montreux Palace]] Hotel in [[Montreux]], Switzerland; he stayed there until the end of his life.<ref name= "theparisreview.org"/> From his sixth-floor quarters he conducted his business and took tours to the Alps, Corsica, and Sicily to hunt butterflies.

[[File:Vladimir Nabokov 1973b.jpg|thumb|Nabokov in 1973]]
Nabokov is known as one of the leading prose stylists of the 20th century; his first writings were in Russian, but he achieved his greatest fame with the novels he wrote in the English language. As a trilingual (also writing in French, see ''Mademoiselle O'') master, he has been compared to [[Joseph Conrad]]; Nabokov, however, disliked both the comparison and Conrad's work. He lamented to the critic [[Edmund Wilson]], "I am too old to change Conradically" – which John Updike later called, "itself a jest of genius". This lament came in 1941, when Nabokov had been an apprentice American for less than one year.<ref name= Bunny />{{rp|50}} <ref>{{cite book| last= Updike| first= John| title= Hugging the Shore| page= 221}}</ref> Later in a November 1950 Wilson letter, Nabokov offers a solid, non-comic appraisal: "Conrad knew how to handle readymade English better than I; but I know better the other kind. He never sinks to the depths of my solecisms, but neither does he scale my verbal peaks."<ref name= Bunny />{{rp|282}} Nabokov translated many of his own early works into English, sometimes in cooperation with his son Dmitri. His trilingual upbringing had a profound influence on his artistry.

Nabokov himself translated into Russian two books that he had originally written in English, ''Conclusive Evidence'' and ''Lolita''. The "translation" of ''Conclusive Evidence'' was made because of Nabokov's feeling of imperfections in the English version. Writing the book, he noted that he needed to translate his own memories into English, and to spend a lot of time explaining things that are well known in Russia; then he decided to re-write the book once again, in his first native language, and after that he made the final version, ''Speak, Memory'' (Nabokov first wanted to name it "Speak, [[Mnemosyne]]"). Nabokov was a proponent of [[individualism]], and rejected concepts and ideologies that curtailed individual freedom and expression, such as [[totalitarianism]] in its various forms, as well as [[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[psychoanalysis]].<ref name= GarlandC/>{{rp|412ff}} [[Poshlost]], or as he transcribed it, ''poshlust'', is disdained and frequently mocked in his works.<ref name= GarlandC />{{rp|628ff}} On translating ''Lolita'', Nabokov writes, "I imagined that in some distant future somebody might produce a Russian version of Lolita. I trained my inner telescope upon that particular point in the distant future and I saw that every paragraph, pock-marked as it is with pitfalls, could lend itself to hideous mistranslation. In the hands of a harmful drudge, the Russian version of Lolita would be entirely degraded and botched by vulgar paraphrases or blunders. So I decided to translate it myself."<ref>{{cite web|last=Toffler|first=Alvin|title=Playboy interview: Vladimir Nabokov|url=http://lib.ru/NABOKOW/Inter03.txt_with-big-pictures.html|work=Playboy|publisher=Playboy|access-date=5 December 2013}}</ref>

Nabokov's creative processes involved writing sections of text on hundreds of index cards, which he expanded into paragraphs and chapters and rearranged to form the structure of his novels, a process that has been adopted by many screenplay writers in subsequent years.<ref name="theparisreview.org">{{cite interview| last= Nabokov| first= Vladimir| interviewer= Herbert Gold |title=Vladimir Nabokov, The Art of Fiction No. 40|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/4310/the-art-of-fiction-no-40-vladimir-nabokov|work=[[The Paris Review]]|issue=41|date=Summer–Fall 1967|access-date=5 June 2018}}</ref>

Nabokov published under the pseudonym "Vladimir Sirin" in the 1920s to 1940s, occasionally to mask his identity from critics.<ref name= "NYTimes obit">{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/03/02/lifetimes/nab-v-obit.html?scp=3&sq=Vladimir%20Nabokov&st=cse |title=Vladimir Nabokov, Author of 'Lolita' and 'Ada,' Is Dead |last=Whiteman |first=Alden |work=The New York Times |date=5 July 1977 |access-date=10 February 2009}}</ref> He also makes cameo appearances in some of his novels, such as the character "Vivian Darkbloom" (an [[anagram]] of "Vladimir Nabokov"), who appears in both ''Lolita'' and ''Ada, or Ardor'', and the character Blavdak Vinomori (another anagram of Nabokov's name) in ''King, Queen, Knave''. Sirin is referenced as a different émigré author in his memoir and is also referenced in ''Pnin''.

Nabokov is noted for his complex plots, clever [[word play]], daring metaphors, and prose style capable of both parody and intense lyricism. He gained both fame and notoriety with his novel ''Lolita'' (1955), which tells of a grown man's devouring passion for a twelve-year-old girl. This and his other novels, particularly ''Pale Fire'' (1962), won him a place among the greatest novelists of the 20th century. His longest novel, which met with a mixed response, is ''[[Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle|Ada]]'' (1969). He devoted more time to the composition of this novel than any of his others. Nabokov's fiction is characterized by linguistic playfulness. For example, his short story "[[The Vane Sisters]]" is famous in part for its [[acrostic]] final paragraph, in which the first letters of each word spell out a message from beyond the grave. In another of his short stories, "[[Signs and Symbols]]" (1958), Nabokov creates a character suffering from an imaginary illness called "Referential Mania," in which the afflicted is faced with a world of environmental objects exchanging coded messages.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wershler|first=Darren|year=2010|title=The Locative, the Ambient, and the Hallucinatory in the Internet of Things| journal=Design and Culture|volume=2|issue=2|pages=199–216|doi=10.2752/175470710X12696138525703|s2cid=144607114}}</ref>

Nabokov's stature as a literary critic is founded largely on his four-volume translation and commentary for [[Alexander Pushkin]]'s novel in verse, ''[[Eugene Onegin]]'', published in 1964. That commentary ended with an appendix titled ''[[Notes on Prosody]]'', which has developed a reputation of its own. It stemmed from his observation that while Pushkin's [[iambic tetrameter]]s had been a part of [[Russian literature]] for a fairly short two centuries, they were clearly understood by the Russian prosodists. On the other hand, he viewed the much older English iambic tetrameters as muddled and poorly documented. In his own words:<blockquote>I have been forced to invent a simple little terminology of my own, explain its application to English verse forms, and indulge in certain rather copious details of classification before even tackling the limited object of these notes to my translation of Pushkin's ''Eugene Onegin'', an object that boils down to very little—in comparison to the forced preliminaries—namely, to a few things that the non-Russian student of Russian literature must know in regard to Russian prosody in general and to ''Eugene Onegin'' in particular.</blockquote>

Nabokov's lectures at Cornell University, as collected in ''Lectures on Literature'', reveal his controversial ideas concerning art.<ref>{{cite book| last = Strehle |first = Susan| title = Actualism: Pynchon's Debt to Nabokov| publisher = University of Wisconsin Press| year = 1971| pages = 37–38}}</ref> He firmly believed that novels should not aim to teach and that readers should not merely empathize with characters but that a 'higher' aesthetic enjoyment should be attained, partly by paying great attention to details of style and structure. He detested what he saw as 'general ideas' in novels, and so when teaching ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', for example, he would insist students keep an eye on where the characters were in Dublin (with the aid of a map) rather than teaching the complex Irish history that many critics see as being essential to an understanding of the novel.<ref>Collected by Fredson Bowers in 1980 and published by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich</ref> In 2010, ''[[Kitsch (magazine)|Kitsch]]'' magazine, a student publication at Cornell, published a piece that focused on student reflections on his lectures and also explored Nabokov's long relationship with ''[[Playboy]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://kitschmag.com/index.php?option=com_frontpage&Itemid=1&limit=9&limitstart=9|title=Kitsch Magazine|access-date=5 December 2015}}</ref> Nabokov also wanted his students to describe the details of the novels rather than a narrative of the story and was very strict when it came to grading. As Edward Jay Epstein described his experience in Nabokov's classes, Nabokov made it clear from the very first lectures that he had little interest in fraternizing with students, who would be known not by their name but by their seat number.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Epstein|first=Edward Jay|author-link=Edward Jay Epstein|title=An A from Nabokov|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2013/04/04/a-from-nabokov/| journal= [[The New York Review of Books]]| date=4 April 2013|access-date=5 June 2018}}</ref>

==Synesthesia==
Nabokov was a self-described [[synesthesia|synesthete]], who at a young age equated the number five with the colour red.<ref>Martin, Patrick. "Synaesthesia, metaphor and right-brain functioning" in ''Egoist''.</ref> Aspects of synesthesia can be found in several of his works. His wife also exhibited synesthesia; like her husband, her mind's eye associated colours with particular letters. They discovered that Dmitri shared the trait, and moreover that the colours he associated with some letters were in some cases blends of his parents' hues—"which is as if [[gene]]s were painting in [[aquarelle]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kulichki.com/moshkow/NABOKOW/Inter02.txt|title=Nabokov's interview| publisher= BBC Television |year= 1962 | via= kulichki.com |access-date=5 December 2015}}</ref>

For some synesthetes, letters are not simply ''associated with'' certain colors, they ''are themselves'' colored. Nabokov frequently endowed his protagonists with a similar gift. In ''[[Bend Sinister (novel)|Bend Sinister]]'' Krug comments on his perception of the word "loyalty" as being like a golden fork lying out in the sun. In ''The Defense'', Nabokov mentioned briefly how the main character's father, a writer, found he was unable to complete a novel that he planned to write, becoming lost in the fabricated storyline by "starting with colors".  Many other subtle references are made in Nabokov's writing that can be traced back to his synesthesia. Many of his characters have a distinct "sensory appetite" reminiscent of synesthesia.<ref>{{cite book| first= John Burt |last= Foster |year= 1993| title= Nabokov's Art of Memory and European Modernism| url= https://archive.org/details/nabokovsartmemor00fost | url-access= limited | publisher= Princeton University Press | pages= [https://archive.org/details/nabokovsartmemor00fost/page/n43 26]–32|isbn= 9780691069715 }}</ref>

==Entomology==
Nabokov's interest in [[entomology]] had been
inspired by books of [[Maria Sibylla Merian]] he had found in the attic of his family's country home in Vyra.<ref>{{cite book| last = Todd| first= Kim| title= Chrysalis: Maria Sibylla Merian and the Secrets of Metamorphosis| year= 2007| publisher= Harcourt| page= [https://archive.org/details/chrysalismariasi00todd/page/11 11]| isbn= 978-0-15-101108-7| url= https://archive.org/details/chrysalismariasi00todd/page/11}}</ref> Throughout an extensive career of collecting he never learned to drive a car, and he depended on his wife Véra to take him to collecting sites. During the 1940s, as a research fellow in [[zoology]], he was responsible for organizing the butterfly collection of the [[Museum of Comparative Zoology]] at [[Harvard University]]. His writings in this area were highly technical. This, combined with his specialty in the relatively unspectacular tribe [[Polyommatini]] of the family [[Lycaenidae]], has left this facet of his life little explored by most admirers of his literary works. He described the [[Karner blue]]. The [[genus]] ''[[Nabokovia]]'' was named after him in honor of this work, as were a number of butterfly and moth species (e.g., many species in the genera ''[[Madeleinea]]'' and ''[[Pseudolucia]]'' bear epithets alluding to Nabokov or names from his novels).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.libraries.psu.edu/nabokov/dzbutt6.htm |title= Butterflies and moths bearing Nabokov's name |website= libraries.psu.edu| publisher=Zembla |year=1996 |access-date=12 February 2009}}</ref> In 1967, Nabokov commented: "The pleasures and rewards of literary inspiration are nothing beside the rapture of discovering a new organ under the microscope or an undescribed species on a mountainside in Iran or Peru. It is not improbable that had there been no revolution in Russia, I would have devoted myself entirely to lepidopterology and never written any novels at all."<ref name="theparisreview.org"/>

The paleontologist and essayist [[Stephen Jay Gould]] discussed Nabokov's [[lepidoptery]] in his essay, "No Science Without Fancy, No Art Without Facts: The Lepidoptery of Vladimir Nabokov" (reprinted in ''[[I Have Landed]]''). Gould notes that Nabokov was occasionally a scientific "stick-in-the-mud". For example, Nabokov never accepted that [[genetics]] or the counting of [[chromosome]]s could be a valid way to distinguish species of insects, and relied on the traditional (for lepidopterists) microscopic comparison of their [[genitalia]].

The [[Harvard Museum of Natural History]], which now contains the Museum of Comparative Zoology, still possesses Nabokov's "genitalia cabinet", where the author stored his collection of male blue butterfly genitalia.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/rarestofrarestor0000pick |title=The Rarest of the Rare: Stories Behind the Treasures at the Harvard Museum of Natural History |isbn=978-0-06-053718-0 |first1=Nancy |last1=Pick |first2=Mark |last2=Sloan |publisher=Harper |year=2004 |access-date=10 March 2010 |url-access=registration }}</ref><ref name= bones /> "Nabokov was a serious taxonomist," says museum staff writer Nancy Pick, author of ''The Rarest of the Rare: Stories Behind the Treasures at the Harvard Museum of Natural History''. "He actually did quite a good job at distinguishing species that you would not think were different—by looking at their genitalia under a microscope six hours a day, seven days a week, until his eyesight was permanently impaired."<ref name= bones>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.gsas.harvard.edu/images/stories/pdfs/colloquy_spring05.pdf|title = Blood, Sweat, and Bones|last = Pick|first = Nancy|date =Spring 2005|journal = Colloquy (Alumni Quarterly)|access-date = 19 November 2014|page = 8|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150908182313/http://www.gsas.harvard.edu/images/stories/pdfs/colloquy_spring05.pdf|archive-date = 8 September 2015|df = dmy-all}}</ref> The rest of his collection, about 4,300 specimens, was given to the Lausanne's [[Musée Cantonal de Zoologie|Museum of Zoology]] in Switzerland.

Though his work was not taken seriously by professional lepidopterists during his life, new genetic research supports Nabokov's hypothesis that a group of butterfly species, called the ''[[Polyommatus]]'' blues, came to the [[New World]] over the [[Bering Strait]] in five waves, eventually reaching Chile.<ref>{{cite news |title=Nabokov Theory on Butterfly Evolution Is Vindicated |last= Zimmer| first= Carl |author-link=Carl Zimmer |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/01/science/01butterfly.html?pagewanted=1 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=25 January 2011 |access-date=25 January 2011}}</ref>

Many of Nabokov's fans have tried to ascribe literary value to his scientific papers, Gould notes. Conversely, others have claimed that his scientific work enriched his literary output. Gould advocates a third view, holding that the other two positions are examples of the ''[[post hoc ergo propter hoc]]'' [[fallacy]]. Rather than assuming that either side of Nabokov's work caused or stimulated the other, Gould proposes that ''both'' stemmed from Nabokov's love of detail, contemplation, and symmetry.

==Chess problems==
Nabokov spent considerable time during his exile composing [[chess problem]]s, which he published in Germany's Russian émigré press, ''[[Poems and Problems]]'' (18 problems) and ''[[Speak, Memory]]'' (one). He describes the process of composing and constructing in his memoir: "The strain on the mind is formidable; the element of time drops out of one's consciousness". To him, the "originality, invention, conciseness, harmony, complexity, and splendid insincerity" of creating a chess problem was similar to that in any other art.

==Politics and views==
=== Russian politics ===
{{rquote|right|''Russia has always been a curiously unpleasant country despite her great literature. Unfortunately, Russians today have completely lost their ability to kill tyrants.''|Vladimir Nabokov<ref name= RussianYears />{{rp|21}} }}

Nabokov was a [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]], in the tradition of his father, a liberal statesman who served in the [[Russian Provisional Government, 1917|Provisional Government]] following the [[February Revolution]] of 1917 as a member of the [[Constitutional Democratic Party]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dragunoiu |first1=Dana |title=Vladimir Nabokov and the Poetics of Liberalism |date=2011 |publisher=Northwestern University Press |page=17}}</ref><ref name= StrongO>{{cite book| title= Strong opinions| first= Vladimir |last= Nabokov| publisher= Vintage Books| year= 1990}}</ref> In ''Speak, Memory'', Nabokov proudly recounted his father's campaigns against despotism and staunch opposition to [[capital punishment]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dragunoiu |first1=Dana |title=Vladimir Nabokov and the Poetics of Liberalism |date=2011 |publisher=Northwestern University Press |page=29}}</ref> Nabokov was a self-proclaimed "White Russian",<ref name="theparisreview.org"/> and was, from its inception, a strong opponent of the Soviet government that came to power following the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] of October 1917.

Throughout his life, Nabokov would remain committed to the classical liberal political philosophy of his father, and equally opposed Tsarist autocracy, communism, and fascism.<ref name= RussianYears>{{cite book |first= Brian| last= Boyd |title=Vladimir Nabokov: The Russian Years |year=1990 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-7011-3700-7}}</ref>{{rp|24–36}}

Nabokov's father Vladimir Dmitrievich Nabokov was the most outspoken defender of Jewish rights in the [[Russian Empire]], continuing in a family tradition that had been led by his own father, Dmitry Nabokov, who as Justice Minister under [[Tsar Alexander II]] had successfully blocked anti-semitic measures from being passed by the Interior Minister.  That family strain would continue in Vladimir Nabokov, who fiercely denounced anti-semitism in his writings, and in the 1930s Nabokov was able to escape Hitler's Germany only with the help of [[Russian Jewish]] émigrés who still had grateful memories of his family's defense of Jews in Tsarist times.<ref name= RussianYears />{{rp|24}}

When asked, in 1969, whether he would like to revisit the land he had fled in 1918, now the Soviet Union, he replied: "There's nothing to look at.  New tenement houses and old churches do not interest me.  The hotels there are terrible. I detest the Soviet theater. Any palace in Italy is superior to the repainted abodes of the Tsars.  The village huts in the forbidden hinterland are as dismally poor as ever, and the wretched peasant flogs his wretched cart horse with the same wretched zest.

=== American politics ===
In the 1940s, as an émigré in America, Nabokov would stress the connection between American and English liberal democracy and the aspirations of the short-lived Russian provisional government. In 1942 he declared: "Democracy is humanity at its best ... it is the natural condition of every man ever since the human mind became conscious not only of the world but of itself."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Boyd |first1=Brian |title=Vladimir Nabokov: The American Years |date=2016 |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=41}}</ref> During the 1960s, in both letters and interviews, he reveals a profound contempt for the [[New Left]] movements, describing the protesters as "conformists" and "goofy hoodlums."<ref name= StrongO />{{rp|139}}<ref name="larmour17">{{cite book| first= David Henry James |last= Larmour| title= Discourse and ideology in Nabokov's prose| url= https://archive.org/details/discourseideolog00larm | url-access= limited | publisher= Routledge| year= 2002| page= [https://archive.org/details/discourseideolog00larm/page/n20 17]|isbn= 9780415286589}}</ref> In a 1967 interview, Nabokov stated that he refused to associate with supporters of Bolshevism or Tsarist autocracy but that he had "friends among intellectual constitutional monarchists as well as among intellectual [[Socialist Revolutionary Party|social revolutionaries]]."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Pifer |first1=Ellen |title=Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita: A Casebook |date=2003 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=195–199}}</ref> Nabokov supported the [[Vietnam War]] effort and voiced admiration for both Presidents [[Lyndon B.

The Russian literary critic [[Yuly Aykhenvald]] was an early admirer of Nabokov, citing in particular his ability to imbue objects with life: "he saturates trivial things with life, sense and psychology and gives a mind to objects; his refined senses notice colorations and nuances, smells and sounds, and everything acquires an unexpected meaning and truth under his gaze and through his words."<ref name=Chamberlain>{{cite book|last=Chamberlain|first=Lesley|title=The Philosophy Steamer|year=2006|publisher=Atlantic Books|location=Great Britain|isbn=978-184354-093-9|page=283}}</ref> The critic [[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]] argued that Nabokov's use of descriptive detail proved an "overpowering, and not always very fruitful, influence on two or three generations after him", including authors such as [[Martin Amis]] and [[John Updike]].<ref>Wood, James.

:With all these Humbert Humbert cats
:Coming on so big and sick?

:For him she's just another nymphet.

It has also been argued that Pynchon's prose style is influenced by Nabokov's preference for actualism over realism.<ref>Strehle, Susan.

Several authors who came to prominence in the 1990s and 2000s have also cited Nabokov's work as a literary influence. [[Aleksandar Hemon]], whose high-wire wordplay and sense of the absurd are often compared to Nabokov's, has acknowledged the latter's impact on his writing.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning novelist [[Michael Chabon]] listed ''Lolita'' and ''Pale Fire'' among the "books that, I thought, changed my life when I read them,"<ref>{{cite web|title = It Changed My Life |url= http://www.michaelchabon.com/archives/2005/03/it_changed_my_l.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20060720152012/http://www.michaelchabon.com/archives/2005/03/it_changed_my_l.html |url-status= dead |archive-date=20 July 2006 |last=Chabon |first=Michael |date=July 2006 |work=michaelchabon.com |access-date=12 February 2009}}</ref> and stated that "Nabokov's English combines aching lyricism with dispassionate precision in a way that seems to render every human emotion in all its intensity but never with an ounce of schmaltz or soggy language".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.libraries.psu.edu/nabokov/vncol26.htm |title=VN Collation No.26 |last=Stringer-Hye |first=Suellen |publisher=Zembla |access-date=12 February 2009}}</ref> Pulitzer Prize winner [[Jeffrey Eugenides]] said that "Nabokov has always been and remains one of my favorite writers.

==Notes==
{{Notelist|refs=
{{efn|name=note1|Confusion over his birth date was generated by some people misunderstanding the relationship between the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] and [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] calendars. At the time of Nabokov's birth, the offset between the calendars was 12 days. His date of birth in the Julian calendar was 10 April 1899; in the Gregorian, 22 April 1899.<ref>[[#BrianBoydTheAmericanYears|Brian Boyd]] p.&nbsp;37</ref> The fact that the offset increased from 12 to 13 days for dates occurring after February 1900 was always irrelevant to earlier dates, and hence a 13-day offset should never have been applied to Nabokov's date of birth. Nevertheless, it was so misapplied by some writers, and 23 April came to be erroneously shown in many places as his birthday. In his memoirs ''[[Speak, Memory]]'' Nabokov indicates that 22 April was the correct date but that he nevertheless preferred to celebrate his birthday "with diminishing pomp" on 23 April (p.&nbsp;6).{{Vague|date=July 2018}}<!-- page 6 of which edition? --> As he happily pointed out on several occasions during interviews, this meant he also shared a birthday with [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Shirley Temple]].<ref name= RussianYears /><ref>{{cite news| work= The New York Times| title= Interview with Vladimir Nabokov| first= Alden |last= Whitman | date= 23 April 1969| page= 20}}</ref>
