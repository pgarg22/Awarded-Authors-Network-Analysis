'''Luiz''' ('''Ludwig''') '''Heinrich Mann''' ({{IPA-de|ˈhaɪnʁɪç ˈman|lang|De-Heinrich Mann.ogg}}; 27 March 1871 &ndash; 11 March 1950) was a German novelist who wrote works with social themes. From 1930 until 1933 he was president of the fine poetry division of the [[Prussian Academy of Arts]]. His numerous criticisms of the growth of [[fascism]] forced him to flee Germany after the [[Nazis]] came to power during 1933.

==Early life==
Born in [[Lübeck]], as the oldest child of Senator Thomas Johann Heinrich Mann, grain merchant and finance minister of the [[Free City of Lübeck]], a state of the [[German Empire]], and [[Júlia da Silva Bruhns]]. He was the elder brother of novelist [[Thomas Mann]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/hmann.htm |title=Heinrich Mann |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904060528/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/hmann.htm |archive-date=September 4, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The [[Mann family]] was an [[affluent]] family of grain merchants of the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] city of Lübeck. After the death of his father, his mother relocated the family to [[Munich]], where Heinrich began his career as a ''freier Schriftsteller'' (free novelist).

==Work==
Mann's essay on [[Émile Zola]] and the novel ''[[Der Untertan]]'' (first published 1905) earned him much respect during the [[Weimar Republic]], since they satirized Imperial German society. Later, in 1930, his book ''[[Professor Unrat]]'' was freely adapted into the movie ''[[Der Blaue Engel]]'' (''The Blue Angel''). [[Carl Zuckmayer]] wrote the script, and [[Josef von Sternberg]] was the director. Mann wanted his paramour, the actress [[Trude Hesterberg]], to play the main female part as the "actress" Lola Lola (named Rosa Fröhlich in the novel), but [[Marlene Dietrich]] was given the part, her first sound role.

Together with [[Albert Einstein]] and other celebrities during 1932, Mann was a signatory to the "[[Urgent Call for Unity]]", asking the voters to reject the Nazis. Einstein and Mann had previously co-authored a letter during 1931 condemning the murder of [[Croatia]]n scholar [[Milan Šufflay]].

Mann became ''[[persona non grata]]'' in [[Nazi Germany]] and left even before the [[Reichstag fire]] of 1933. He went to France where he lived in [[Paris]] and [[Nice]]. During the German occupation, he made his way to [[Marseille]], where he was aided by [[Varian Fry]] during 1940 to escape to Spain. With him were his wife Nelly Kröger, his nephew [[Golo Mann]], [[Alma Mahler|Alma Mahler-Werfel]] and [[Franz Werfel]]. After arriving in Portugal, the group stayed in Monte Estoril, at the Grande Hotel D’Itália, between 18 September and 4 October 1940.<ref>[[Exiles_Memorial_Center|Exiles Memorial Center.]]</ref> On 4 October 1940, they boarded the ''[[Greek_Line|S.S. Nea Hellas]]'', headed for New York City.

The Nazis burnt Heinrich Mann's books as "contrary to the German spirit" during [[Nazi book burning|the infamous book burning]] of May 10, 1933, which was instigated by the then Nazi propaganda minister [[Joseph Goebbels]].

==Later life==

During the 1930s and later in American exile, Mann's literary popularity waned. Nevertheless, he wrote ''Die Jugend des Königs Henri Quatre'' and ''Die Vollendung des Königs Henri Quatre'' as part of the [[Exilliteratur]]. The two novels described the life and importance of [[Henry IV of France]] and were acclaimed by his brother Thomas Mann, who spoke of the "great splendour and dynamic art" of the work. The plot, based on Europe's early [[modern history]] from a French perspective, anticipated the end of [[French–German enmity]].

His second wife, {{ill|Nelly Mann|de}} (1898–1944), committed suicide in Los Angeles.

Heinrich Mann died on March 11, 1950, sixteen days before his 79th birthday, in [[Santa Monica, California]], lonely and without much money, just months before he was to relocate to East Berlin to become president of the [[Akademie der Künste der DDR|German Academy of Arts]]. His ashes were later taken to [[East Germany]] and were interred at the [[Dorotheenstadt Cemetery]] in a [[Ehrengrab|grave of honor]].

==Popular culture==
Mann was portrayed by [[Alec Guinness]] in the 1992 television adaptation of [[Christopher Hampton]]'s play ''Tales from Hollywood''.

In ''[[Die Manns – Ein Jahrhundertroman]]'' (2001) he was played by [[Jürgen Hentsch]].
