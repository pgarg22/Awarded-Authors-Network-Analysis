'''Ian Cameron Esslemont''' (born 1962) is a Canadian writer. He was trained and has worked as an [[archaeologist]]. He is best known for his series ''Novels of the Malazan Empire'', which is set in the same world as the ''[[Malazan Book of the Fallen]]'' [[epic fantasy]] series written by his friend and collaborator, [[Steven Erikson]]. Esslemont is the co-creator of the Malazan world.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Jeremly L. C.|title=The Minimal and Finely Focused Fantasy of Ian C.

==Biography==
Ian Cameron Esslemont was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. He has lived and worked in Southeast Asia, including four years spent in Thailand and Japan. He is currently working on a new trilogy set in the Malaz world. He lives in [[Alaska]] with his wife, novelist Gerri Brightwell, and their three sons.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ian C Esslemont Biography|url=https://www.penguin.co.uk/authors/ian-c-esslemont/1050676/|publisher=Penguin Books|access-date=2 March 2016}}</ref>

Esslemont and Erikson co-created the Malazan world in 1982 as a backdrop for [[role-playing games]]. In 1991 they collaborated on a feature film script set in the same world, entitled ''[[Gardens of the Moon]]''. When the script did not sell, Erikson greatly expanded the story and turned it into a novel. The two writers agreed to both write books set in the same world. However, it took a further eight years before ''Gardens of the Moon'' was published by [[Bantam Books|Bantam]] UK and Erikson agreed to write a further nine novels set in the same world. Life and work commitments delayed Esslemont's own entries to the series until 2004, when his first novel, ''[[Night of Knives]]'', was published as a limited edition by [[PS Publishing]] (a mass-market release by Bantam UK followed in 2007). This book was a prequel to the main Malazan sequence. His second novel, ''[[Return of the Crimson Guard]]'', takes place within the main Malazan sequence, shortly after the events of the sixth book, ''[[The Bonehunters]]''. It was published by PS Publishing in May 2008 and by Bantam UK later that year. Both ''[[Night of Knives]]'' and ''[[Return of the Crimson Guard]]'' have now been bought by Tor for publication in the United States.  His third novel, ''[[Stonewielder]]'', was published by Bantam UK in 2010 and Tor in the US.  His fourth novel, ''[[Orb Sceptre Throne]]'' was published in 2012. In spring 2014 he signed a contract with Bantam for three more novels set in the Malazan world.
