==Biography==
===Early life===
Yevtushenko was born '''Yevgeny Aleksandrovich Gangnus''' (he later took his mother's last name, Yevtushenko) in the Irkutsk region of [[Siberia]] in a small town called [[Zima (town)|Zima]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zhurnal.lib.ru/w/wagapow_a/zimasthtm-1.shtml|title=Yevtushenko Yevgeny.

He had Russian, Baltic German, Ukrainian, Polish, Belarusian and Tatar roots. His maternal great-grandfather Joseph Baikovsky belonged to [[szlachta]], while his wife was of Ukrainian descent. They were exiled to Siberia after a peasant rebellion headed by Joseph. One of their daughters – Maria Baikovskaya – married Ermolai Naumovich Yevtushenko who was of Belarusian descent. He served as a soldier in the [[Russian Imperial Army|Imperial Army]] during [[World War I]] and as an officer in the [[Red Army]] during the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]]. His paternal ancestors were Germans who moved to the Russian Empire in 1767. His grandfather Rudolph Gangnus, a math teacher of [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German descent]], married Anna Plotnikova of [[Russian nobility]].<ref>Yevgeny Yevtushenko, ''Wolf Passport'', Moscow, 2015, p. 32. {{ISBN|978-5-389-09866-4}}</ref> Both of Yevtushenko's grandfathers were arrested during [[Purges of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Stalin's purges]] as "enemies of the people" in 1937.<ref name="Colp"/> Yevtushenko's father, Aleksandr Rudolfovich Gangnus, was a geologist, as was his mother, Zinaida Ermolaevna Yevtushenko, who later became a singer.<ref name="auto1">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/01/world/europe/yevgeny-yevtushenko-dead-dissident-soviet-poet.html|title=Yevgeny Yevtushenko, Poet Who Stirred a Generation of Soviets, Dies at 83|first=Raymond H.|last=Anderson|date=1 April 2017|access-date=11 December 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> The boy accompanied his father on geological expeditions to [[Kazakhstan]] in 1948, and to Altai, Siberia, in 1950. Young Yevtushenko wrote his first verses and humorous [[Chastushka|chastushki]] while living in Zima, Siberia. His parents were divorced when he was 7 and he was raised by his mother.<ref name="Colp"/> By age 10 he had composed his first poem. Six years later a sports journal was the first periodical to publish his poetry. At 19, he published his first book of poems, ''The Prospects of the Future''.<ref name="Colp"/>

After the [[Second World War]], Yevtushenko moved to [[Moscow]] and from 1951 to 1954 studied at the [[Maxim Gorky Literature Institute|Gorky Institute of Literature in Moscow]], from which he [[Dropping out|dropped out]]. In 1952 he joined the [[Union of Soviet Writers]] after publication of his first collection of poetry. His early poem ''So mnoyu vot chto proiskhodit'' (''"That's what is happening to me"'') became a very popular song, performed by actor-songwriter [[Alexander Dolsky]]. In 1955 Yevtushenko wrote a poem about the Soviet borders being an obstacle in his life. His first important publication was the 1956 poem ''Stantsiya Zima'' (''"Zima Station"''). In 1957, he was expelled from the Literary Institute for "individualism". He was banned from traveling, but gained wide popularity with the Soviet public. His early work also drew praise from [[Boris Pasternak]], [[Carl Sandburg]] and [[Robert Frost]].<ref name="Queens">Queens College Office of Communications [http://www.qc.cuny.edu/nis/Releases/viewNews.php?id=87 "Queens College Presents an Evening of Poetry and Music with Yevgeny Yevtushenko on 11 December,"] 18 November 2003, accessed 10 January 2009.</ref><ref name="Tulsa1">University of Tulsa News/Events/Publications.

===During the Khrushchev Thaw===
Yevtushenko was one of the authors politically active during the [[Khrushchev Thaw]]. In 1961 he wrote what would become perhaps his most famous poem, ''[[Babi Yar in poetry|Babiyy Yar]]'', in which he denounced the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] distortion of historical fact regarding the [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[Babi Yar|massacre of the Jewish population]] of [[Kyiv]] in September 1941, as well as the [[anti-Semitism]] still widespread in the Soviet Union. The usual Soviet policy in relation to [[the Holocaust]] in Russia was to describe it as general atrocities against Soviet citizens, and to avoid mentioning that it was a [[genocide]] of the Jews. However, Yevtushenko's work ''Babiyy Yar'' "spoke not only of the Nazi atrocities, but the Soviet government's own persecution of Jewish people."<ref name="Renowned"/> The poem was published in a major newspaper, ''[[Literaturnaya Gazeta]]'',<ref>''Literaturnaya Gazeta'', 19 September 1961.</ref> achieved widespread circulation in numerous copies, and later was set to music, together with four other Yevtushenko poems, by [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] in his [[Symphony No. 13 (Shostakovich)|Thirteenth Symphony]], subtitled ''Babi Yar''. Of Yevtushenko's work, Shostakovich has said, "Morality is a sister of conscience. And perhaps God is with Yevtushenko when he speaks of conscience. Every morning, in place of prayers, I reread or repeat by memory two poems by Yevtushenko: 'Career' or 'Boots'."<ref name="Queens"/>

After the [[22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in October 1961 – at which the former dictator [[Joseph Stalin]] was denounced in public for crimes committed in the 1930s, Yevtushenko was allowed to join the editorial board of the journal ''[[Yunost]]'', and in October 1962 was sent to Cuba as a correspondent of ''[[Pravda]]''. In 1962, knowing that there was backlash against the anti-Stalin campaign, Yevtushenko wrote ''Nasledniki Stalina'' (''The Heirs of Stalin''), in which he stated that although Stalin was dead, [[Stalinism]] and its legacy still dominated the country; in the poem he also directly addressed the Soviet government, imploring them to make sure that Stalin would "never rise again".<ref name="nytobit">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/01/world/europe/yevgeny-yevtushenko-dead-dissident-soviet-poet.html?_r=1|title=Yevgeny Yevtushenko, Poet Who Stirred a Generation of Soviets, Dies at 83|last=Anderson|first=Raymond|date=1 April 2017|work=New York Times|access-date=6 April 2017}}</ref> The poem also taunted neo-Stalinists for being out of touch with the times, saying "No wonder they suffer heart attacks." It was well known that Khrushchev's most dangerous rival, [[Frol Kozlov]] had recently had a heart attack.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tatu |first1=Michel |title=Power in the Kremlin, From Khrushchev's Decline to Collective Leadership |date=1969 |publisher=Collins |location=London |pages=248–49}}</ref> Yevtushenko wrote in his memoirs that he sent a copy of the poem to Khrushchev, who approved its publication. Published originally in ''[[Pravda]]'' on 21 October 1962, the poem was not republished until a quarter of a century later, in the times of the comparatively liberal [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party]] leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. In January 1963, he began a tour of West Germany and France, and while he was in Paris, arranged for his ''Precocious Autobiography'' to be serialised in ''L'Express''. This created a scandal in Moscow. In February, he was ordered to return to the USSR and at the end of March he was accused by a writer named G. A. Zhukov of an 'act of treason' and in April another writer, named Vladimir Fedorov, proposed that he be expelled from the Writers' Union.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tatu |title=Power in the Kremlin |pages=317, 319}}</ref> No official action was taken against him, but he was barred from travelling abroad for several years.
 
Yevtushenko became one of the best known poets of the 1950s and 1960s in the Soviet Union.<ref>''TU poet marks massacre day.'' Julie Bisbee. The Oklahoman (Oklahoma City, OK). NEWS; Pg. 19A. 29 September 2006.</ref> He was part of the 1960s generation, which included such writers as [[Vasili Aksyonov]], [[Andrei Voznesensky]], [[Bella Akhmadulina]], [[Robert Rozhdestvensky]], [[Anatoly Gladilin]]; as well as actors [[Andrei Mironov (actor)|Andrei Mironov]], [[Aleksandr Zbruyev]], [[Natalya Fateyeva]], and many others. During the time, [[Anna Akhmatova]], a number of whose family members suffered under the communist rule, criticised Yevtushenko's aesthetic ideals and his poetics. The late Russian poet Victor Krivulin quotes her saying that "Yevtushenko doesn't rise above an average newspaper satirist's level. Yevtushenko and [[Andrei Voznesensky]]'s works just don't do it for me, therefore neither of them exists for me as a poet."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kid.com.ua/news10154.html |title=Кривулин В.Б.

Alternatively, Yevtushenko was much respected by others at the time both for his poetry and his political stance toward the Soviet government. "Dissident [[Pavel Litvinov]] had said that '[Yevtushenko] expressed what my generation felt. Then we left him behind.'"<ref name="Colp"/> Between 1963 until 1965, for example, Yevtushenko, already an internationally recognised littérateur, was banned <!--for political reasons--> from traveling outside the Soviet Union.<ref name="demanding">"A Demanding Kind of Genius," ''[[Irish Independent]]'', 8 May 2004.</ref> In 1963 he was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] for his poem "Babi Yar", concerning the [[Babi Yar|1941 massacres at Kyiv]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.calvertjournal.com/news/show/8030/celebrated-babi-yar-poet-yevgeny-yevtushenko-dies|title=Celebrated Babi Yar poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko dies|publisher=calvertjournal.com|access-date=4 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-39467270|title=Soviet-era poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko dies aged 84|date=1 April 2017|work=bbc.co.uk|access-date=4 April 2017}}</ref>

Generally, however, Yevtushenko was still the most extensively travelled Soviet poet, possessing an amazing capability to balance between moderate criticism of Soviet regime, which gained him popularity in the West, and, as noted by some, a strong Marxist–Leninist ideological stance,<ref name="Colp">Judith Colp. "Yevtushenko: The story of a superstar poet," ''The Washington Times'', 3 January 1991, p. E1.</ref> which allegedly proved his loyalty to Soviet authorities.

At that time KGB Chairman [[Vladimir Semichastny]] and the next KGB Chairman [[Yuri Andropov]] reported to the Communist Politburo on the "Anti-Soviet activity of poet Yevtushenko." Nevertheless, some nicknamed Yevtushenko "Zhenya Gapon," comparing him to Father [[Georgy Gapon]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.novayagazeta.ru/data/2000/72/25.html |script-title=ru:МЫ, Я И ЕВТУШЕНКО |author=Stanislav Rassadin |publisher=Novaya Gazeta |date=2 October 2000|language=ru}}</ref> a Russian priest who at the time of the Revolution of 1905 was both a leader of rebellious workers and a [[okhrana|secret police agent]].

===Controversy===

In 1965, Yevtushenko joined [[Anna Akhmatova]], [[Korney Chukovsky]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and others and co-signed the letter of protest against the unfair trial of [[Joseph Brodsky]] as a result of the court case against him initiated by the Soviet authorities.<ref>{{cite news |author= Natalia Zhdanova |title= Timelessness: Water Frees Time from Time Itself |work= NevaNews.com |place= St. Petersburg |date= 1 August 2007 |access-date= 11 January 2009 |url= http://www.nevanews.com/index.php?id_article=666&section=13 |language= ru |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081003134655/http://www.nevanews.com/index.php?id_article=666&section=13 |archive-date= 3 October 2008 |df= dmy-all }}</ref> He subsequently co-signed a letter against the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in 1968.<ref name="Weiss">{{cite news|url=http://www.nysun.com/arts/citizen-of-human-grief/71062/|title=A Citizen of Human Grief|last=Weiss|first=Michael|date=11 February 2008|newspaper=The New York Sun|access-date=6 April 2017}}</ref>

Nevertheless, "when, in 1987, Yevtushenko was made an honorary member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]], Brodsky himself led a flurry of protest, accusing Yevtushenko of duplicity and claiming that Yevtushenko's criticism of the Soviet Union was launched only in the directions approved by the Party and that he criticised what was acceptable to the Kremlin, when it was acceptable to the Kremlin, while soaking up adulation and honours as a fearless voice of dissent."<ref name="demanding"/> Further, of note is "Yevtushenko's protest of the trial of [[Andrei Sinyavsky]] and [[Yuli Daniel]], an event now credited with inaugurating the modern dissident movement and readying the national pulse for perestroika. Both writers had toiled under pseudonyms and stood accused, in 1966, of "anti-Soviet activity" for the views espoused by their fictional characters. But Yevtushenko's actual position was that the writers were guilty, only punished too severely."<ref name="Weiss"/> "Yevtushenko was not among the authors of the "Letter of the 63" who protested [their convictions]."<ref name="Colp"/>

On 23 August 1968, Yevtushenko sent a telegram to the Soviet prime minister [[Alexei Kosygin]] lamenting the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|invasion of Czechoslovakia]], but "when Yevtushenko was nominated for the poetry chair at Oxford in 1968, [[Kingsley Amis]], [[Bernard Levin]], and the Russian-Hungarian historian [[Tibor Szamuely (historian)|Tibor Szamuely]] led the campaign against him, arguing that he had made life difficult for his fellow Soviet writers."<ref name="Weiss"/>

===Films===
He was filmed as himself during the 1950s as a performing poet-actor. Yevtushenko contributed lyrics to several Soviet films and contributed to the script of ''[[Soy Cuba]]'' (''I Am Cuba'', 1964), a Soviet propaganda film.<ref name=Liukkonen/> His acting career began with the leading role in ''[[Vzlyot]]'' (''Take-Off'', 1979) by director [[Savva Kulish]], where he played the leading role as Russian rocket scientist [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]].<ref name=words>{{cite web|url=https://www.wordswithoutborders.org/contributor/yevgeny-yevtushenko|title=Yevgeny Yevtushenko – Words Without Borders|publisher=ordswithoutborders.org|access-date=1 April 2017}}</ref> Yevtushenko also made two films as a writer/director.

===Post-Soviet period===
In 1989 Yevtushenko was elected as a representative for [[Kharkiv]] in the Soviet Parliament (Congress of Peoples Deputies), where he was a member of the pro-democratic group supporting [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].<ref name="Colp"/> In 1991, he supported [[Boris Yeltsin]], as the latter defended the parliament of the [[Russian Federation]] during the hardline coup that sought to oust Gorbachev and reverse "perestroika".<ref name="Tulsa1"/><ref name="West"/> Later, however, when Yeltsin sent tanks into restive [[Chechnya]], Yevtushenko reportedly "denounced his old ally and refused to accept an award from him."<ref name="West"/>

In the post-Soviet era Yevtushenko actively discussed environmental issues, confronted Russian Nationalist writers from the alternative Union of the Writers of Russia, and campaigned for the preservation of the memory of victims of Stalin's [[Gulag]]. In 1995 he published his huge anthology of contemporary Russian poetry entitled ''Verses of the Century''.<ref>{{cite book|script-title=ru:Строфы века. Антология русской поэзии|year=1995|language=ru|trans-title=Verses of the Century: An Anthology of Russian Poetry|editor=Yvgeny Yevtushenko}}</ref>

===In the West===
After October 2007 Yevtushenko divided his time between Russia and the United States, teaching Russian and European poetry and the history of world cinema at the [[University of Tulsa]] in [[Oklahoma]] and at [[Queens College, City University of New York|Queens College]] of the [[City University of New York]]. In the West he was best known for his criticism of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] bureaucracy and appeals for getting rid of the legacy of [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buffalo.edu/ubreporter/archive/2012_11_08/yevtushenko_reading|title=Yevtushenko wows UB audiences|last=Hill|first=David|date=5 November 2012|publisher=UB Reporter|access-date=6 April 2017}}</ref> He was working on a three-volume collection of 11th to 20th-century Russian poetry, and planned a novel based on his time in Havana during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] (he was, reportedly, good friends with [[Che Guevara]], [[Salvador Allende]] and [[Pablo Neruda]]).<ref name="Queens"/><ref name="Tulsa1"/><ref name="West"/> In October 2007, he was an artist-in-residence with the College of Arts and Humanities at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], and recited his poem ''Babi Yar'' before a performance of [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]'s [[Symphony No. 13 (Shostakovich)|Symphony No. 13]], which sets five of his poems, by the University of Maryland Symphony Orchestra and the men of the UM Choirs, with David Brundage as the bass soloist. The first performance of the two works on the same program that Shostakovich set to Yevtushenko texts, "Babi Yar" (Symphony 13) and "The Execution of Stepan Razin," with Yevtushenko present, took place at the University of Houston's [[Moores School of Music]] in 1998, under the baton of Franz Anton Krager. The performance was the idea of the then-President of the Moores School of Music Society, Philip Berquist, a long time friend of Yevtushenko, after the poet informed him that the two works had never been performed together. Yevtushenko had told Berquist that Leonard Bernstein had wanted to do so, but it never came to realization. The first translation of Yevtushenko's poetry into English was ''Yevtushenko: Selected Poems'', a translation by [[Robin Milner-Gulland]] and [[Peter Levi]] published in 1962.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Yevtushenko, The Selected Poetry of Yevgeny|publisher = Penguin Classics|date = 30 November 1962|location = Harmondsworth, Eng.; Baltimore|isbn = 9780140420692|language = en|first = Yevgeny|last = Yevtushenko}}</ref>

He said in a 1995 interview, "I like very much the University of Tulsa. My students are sons of ranchers, even cowboys, oil engineers. They are different people, but they are very gifted. They are closer to Mother Nature than the big city. They are more sensitive."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/01/yevgeny-yevtushenko-russian-poet-babi-yar-dies-84|title=Yevgeny Yevtushenko, Russian poet who memorialised Babi Yar, dies aged 84|agency=Associated Press|date=1 April 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=2 April 2017}}</ref>

==Criticism==
[[Michael Weiss (journalist)|Michael Weiss]], writing in ''[[The New York Sun]]'' in 2008, asserted that "Yevtushenko's politics have always been a complicated mixture of bravery, populism, and vulgar accommodation with dictatorship."<ref name="Weiss"/> Judith Colp of ''[[The Washington Times]]'', for example, described Yevtushenko as "his country's most controversial modern poet, a man whose reputation is poised between courageous behind-the-scenes reformer and failed dissident."<ref name="Colp"/> Indeed, "as the Sovietologist and literary critic [[Robert Conquest]] put it in a 1974 profile: 'The writers who had briefly flourished [under Khrushchev's thaw] went two different ways. Solzhenitsyn and his like into silenced opposition; Yevtushenko and his like, sometimes reluctantly, sometimes in the hope of still influencing matters a little, into well-rewarded collaboration.'"<ref name="Weiss"/> Some argue that before the appearance of [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], [[Andrei Sakharov]], and the dissident movement in the Soviet Union, Yevtushenko, through his poetry, was the first voice to speak out against Stalinism<ref name="Renowned">Donald W. Patterson, "Renowned Poet to Visit City," ''[[News & Record]]'' (Greensboro, NC), 8 April 1999, p. 3.</ref> (although [[Boris Pasternak]] is often considered "to have helped give birth to the dissident movement with the publication of his ''[[Doctor Zhivago (novel)|Doctor Zhivago]]''").<ref name="Colp"/> Colp adds: "Sovietologist Stephen Cohen of Princeton University contends that Yevtushenko was among those Soviets who didn't become dissidents but in their own way tried to improve conditions and prepare the way for reform, [saying that] 'They exhibited a kind of civic courage that many Americans didn't recognize.'"<ref name="Colp"/> Kevin O'Connor, in his ''Intellectuals and Apparatchiks,'' noted that Yevtushenko was "a popular liberal who never experienced the sort of intimidation that characterized regime's treatment of dissident writers Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and [[Vladimir Voinovich]] (each of whom was forced to leave the USSR)."<ref>Kevin O'Connor, ''Intellectuals and Apparatchiks'', Lexington Books, 2008, p. 89.</ref>

Brodsky repeatedly criticised Yevtushenko for what he perceived as his "conformism", especially after the latter was made a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.<ref name="West">{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/west-awakes-to-yevtushenko-1.1149619|title=West awakes to Yevtushenko|first=Daniel|last=McLaughlin|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|date= 17 July 2004|page=56}}</ref><ref>Dovlatov, S. And then Brodsky said... Graph, Issue 3.3, 1999, p.10.</ref> Commenting on this controversy in ''A Night in the Nabokov Hotel'', an anthology of Russian poetry in English translation, [[Anatoly Kudryavitsky]] wrote the following: "A few Russian poets enjoyed virtual pop-star status, unthinkable if transposed to other parts of Europe. In reality, they were far from any sort of protest against Soviet totalitarianism and therefore could not be regarded as anything else but naughty children of the regime."<ref>Kudryavitsky, A. Introduction. In ''A Night in the Nabokov Hotel. 20 Contemporary Poets from Russia'' Edited by Anatoly Kudryavitsky. Dublin, Dedalus Press 2006) ([http://www.dedaluspress.com/anthologies/nabokovhotel.html Online]</ref> Furthermore, some criticized Yevtushenko regarding Pasternak's widow, given that "when Pasternak's widow, [[Olga Ivinskaya]], was imprisoned on trumped-up charges of illegally dealing in foreign currency, Yevtushenko publicly maligned her [and added] that ''Doctor Zhivago'' was not worth publishing in the Soviet Union."<ref name="Colp"/> "The exiled poet Joseph Brodsky once said of Yevtushenko, 'He throws stones only in directions that are officially sanctioned and approved.'"<ref name="auto1"/>

Moreover, "the poet [[Irina Ratushinskaya]], upon her release from prison and arrival in the West, dismissed Yevtushenko as ''an official poet'' and the novelist [[Vasily Aksyonov]] has also refused contact [with Yevtushenko]."<ref name="Bohlen">''[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/20/world/for-yevtushenko-a-search-for-a-little-respect.html For Yevtushenko, a Search for a Little Respect].'' CELESTINE BOHLEN. The New York Times. Section 1; Part 1, Page 16, Column 3; Foreign Desk 20 November 1988.</ref> Responding to the criticism, Yevtushenko reportedly said:

<blockquote>Who could sanction me to write ''Babi Yar'', or my protests against the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|(1968) Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia]]? Only I criticised Khrushchev to his face; not even Solzhenitsyn did that. It is only the envy of people who couldn't stand against the propaganda machine, and they invented things about my generation, the artists of the '60s. Our generation was breaking the Iron Curtain. It was a generation crippled by history, and most of our dreams were doomed to be unfulfilled – but the fight for freedom was not in vain.<ref name="West"/></blockquote>

Yevtushenko further notes that "in several cases [he] personally rose to the defense of these writers, interceding privately for Ratushinskaya's release from prison, defending Aksionov and others who were expelled from the Writers' Union."<ref name="Bohlen"/>

Critics differ on the stature of Yevtushenko in the literature world, with "most Western intellectuals and many Russian scholars extol[ing] him as the greatest writer of his generation, the voice of Soviet life."<ref name="enotes.com">"[http://www.enotes.com/yevgeny-yevtushenko-criticism/yevtushenko-yevgeny Yevtushenko, Yevgeny: Introduction]."

Retrieved 16 July 2016.</ref> They "acknowledge that his speaking tours have won him converts among audiences impressed with his dramatic readings and charismatic personality. Tina Tupikina Glaessner (1967) refers to him as "one of the greatest poets of the modern age". She states that "Bratsk Station" offers the greatest insight into Soviet life of any work in modern Russian literature. Two decades later, in his 1988 article, Michael Pursglove echoes her sentiments, referring to Stanciya Zima as "one of the landmarks of Soviet literature."<ref name="enotes.com"/>

Yevtushenko's defenders point to "how much he did to oppose the Stalin legacy, his animus fueled by the knowledge that both of his grandfathers had perished in Stalin’s purges of the 1930s. He was expelled from his university in 1956 for joining the defense of a banned novel, [[Vladimir Dudintsev]]'s "Not by Bread Alone". He refused to join in the official campaign against Boris Pasternak, the author of "Doctor Zhivago" and the recipient of the 1958 Nobel Prize in Literature. Yevtushenko denounced the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968; interceded with the KGB chief, [[Yuri V. Andropov]], on behalf of another Nobel laureate, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn; and opposed the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979."<ref name="auto1"/>
