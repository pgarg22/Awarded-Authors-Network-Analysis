Pratchett earned five [[O-levels]] and started [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-level]] courses in Art, English and History. His initial career choice was [[journalism]] and he left school at 17, in 1965, to start an apprenticeship with Arthur Church, the editor of the ''[[Bucks Free Press]]''.

===Career===
In 1968, Pratchett interviewed [[Peter Bander van Duren]], co-director of a small publishing company, Colin Smythe Ltd. Pratchett mentioned he had written a manuscript, ''[[The Carpet People]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Welcome to the world of Terry|work=The Scotsman online|url=http://news.scotsman.com/terrypratchett/Welcome-to-the-world-of.2470398.jp|date=16 October 2003|access-date=17 December 2008}}</ref> Colin Smythe Ltd published the book in 1971, with illustrations by Pratchett. It received strong, although few, reviews<ref>Peter Grosvenor in the ''Daily Express'', 9 December 1971; Rosemary Doyle in ''The Irish Times'', 7 January 1972; Michael Pollard in ''Teacher's World'', 7 March 1972.</ref> and was followed by the [[science fiction]] novels ''[[The Dark Side of the Sun]]'' (10 May 1976) and ''[[Strata (novel)|Strata]]'' (15 June 1981).

After various positions in journalism, in 1980 Pratchett became Press Officer for the [[CEGB|Central Electricity Generating Board]] (CEGB) in an area that covered four [[nuclear power station]]s. He later joked that he had demonstrated "impeccable timing" by making this career change so soon after the [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island]] nuclear accident in [[Pennsylvania]], US, and said he would "write a book about my experiences, if I thought anyone would believe it".<ref name="writerswrite">{{cite news|title=A conversation with Terry Pratchett|work=Writerswrite.com|url=http://www.writerswrite.com/journal/apr00/pratchett.htm|date=26 March 2007|access-date=17 December 2008}}</ref>

The first Discworld novel, ''[[The Colour of Magic]]'', was published in [[hardback]] by Colin Smythe Ltd in 1983. The paperback edition was published by Corgi, an [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] of [[Transworld (company)|Transworld]], in 1985. Pratchett's popularity increased when the BBC's ''[[Woman's Hour]]'' broadcast ''The Colour of Magic'' as a serial in six parts, and later ''[[Equal Rites]]''. Subsequently, the hardback rights were taken by the publishing house [[Victor Gollancz Ltd]], which remained Pratchett's publisher until 1997, Colin Smythe having become Pratchett's [[Literary agent|agent]]. Pratchett was the first fantasy author published by Gollancz.<ref name="smythe"/>

Pratchett gave up working for the CEGB to make his living through writing in 1987, after finishing the fourth Discworld novel, ''[[Mort]]''. His sales increased quickly and many of his books occupied top places on the best-seller list; he was the UK's best-selling author of the 1990s.<ref name="guardian"/> According to ''The Times'', Pratchett was the top-selling and highest earning UK author in 1996.<ref name="smythe"/> Some of his books have been published by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], another Transworld imprint. In the US, Pratchett is published by [[HarperCollins]].

According to the ''Bookseller's Pocket Yearbook'' (2005), in 2003 Pratchett's UK sales amounted to 3.4% of the fiction market by hardback sales and 3.8% by value, putting him in second place behind [[J. K. Rowling]] (6% and 5.6%, respectively), while in the paperback sales list Pratchett came 5th with 1.2% and 1.3% by value (behind [[James Patterson]] (1.9% and 1.7%), [[Alexander McCall Smith]], [[John Grisham]], and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]).<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Jason Anthony, DiscworldMonthly.co.uk|url=http://www.discworldmonthly.co.uk/dwm0100.php|title=Discworld Monthly – Issue 100: August 2005 – New from Colin Smyth|date=August 2005|access-date=6 June 2007}}</ref> He has UK sales of more than 2.5&nbsp;million copies a year.<ref name="skyone">{{cite web|publisher=Sky One |url=http://www.skyone.co.uk/hogfather/terrypratchett.htm |title=Terry Pratchett: Biography |year=2006 |access-date=8 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513212010/http://www.skyone.co.uk/HOGFATHER/terrypratchett.htm |archive-date=13 May 2007 }}</ref>{{Better source needed|date=March 2015}} His 2011 ''Discworld'' novel ''[[Snuff (Pratchett novel)|Snuff]]'' became the third-fastest-selling hardback adult-readership novel since records began in the UK, selling 55,000&nbsp;copies in the first three days.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Pratchett's Snuff snaffles top spot with ease|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/pratchetts-snuff-snaffles-top-spot-ease.html|magazine=The Bookseller|access-date=3 December 2012}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Pratchett married Lyn Purves at the Congregational Church, [[Gerrards Cross]], on 5 October 1968.<ref name="smythe"/> They moved to [[Rowberrow]], [[Somerset]], in 1970. Their daughter [[Rhianna Pratchett]], also a writer, was born there in 1976. In 1993, the family moved to [[Broad Chalke]], a village west of [[Salisbury]], [[Wiltshire]].<ref>{{cite news|date=30 December 2010|title=Terry Pratchett celebrated by new Royal Mail stamps|work=BBC Wiltshire|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/wiltshire/hi/people_and_places/arts_and_culture/newsid_9327000/9327675.stm|access-date=26 June 2013}}</ref> He was the patron of the Friends of [[High Wycombe]] Library.<ref name="fohwl">{{cite web|title=Friends of High Wycombe Libraries|url=http://www.lookups.com.au/wiki/friends-in-high-wycombe-library-report.php|access-date=21 November 2012}}</ref> In 2013 he gave a talk at Beaconsfield Library which he had visited as a child and donated the income from the event to it. He also visited his former school to speak to the students.<ref name=bfp />

Pratchett often wore large, black hats, a style described as "more that of urban cowboy than city gent".<ref name="ind" /> Concern for the future of civilisation prompted him to install five&nbsp;kilowatts of [[solar cell|photovoltaic cells]] (for [[solar energy]]) at his house.<ref name="theage">{{cite news|date=17 February 2007|title=Meeting Mr Pratchett|newspaper=The Age|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/books/meeting-mr-pratchett/2007/02/15/1171405371862.html?page=fullpage|access-date=17 February 2008}}</ref>

==Interests==

===Computing===
Pratchett started to use computers for writing as soon as they were available to him. His first computer was a [[Sinclair ZX81]]; the first computer he used properly for writing was an [[Amstrad CPC|Amstrad CPC 464]], later replaced by a [[Personal computer|PC]]. Pratchett was one of the first authors to routinely use the Internet to communicate with fans, and was a contributor to the [[Usenet]] newsgroup alt.fan.pratchett from 1992.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://groups.google.com/group/alt.fan.pratchett/browse_frm/thread/6d66f88060364dbb| title = alt.fan.pratchett| date = 5 July 1992| access-date =6 June 2007}}</ref> However, he did not consider the Internet a hobby, just another "thing to use".<ref name="writerswrite" /> He had many computers in his house,<ref name="writerswrite" /> with a bank of six [[Computer monitor|monitors]] rigged up to ease writing.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Orr|first1=Deborah|title=Terry Pratchett: 'If I'd known what a progressive brain disease could do for your PR profile I may have had one earlier'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/terry-pratchett-if-id-known-what-a-progressive-brain-disease-could-do-for-your-pr-profile-i-may-have-had-one-earlier-1036584.html|newspaper=The Independent|access-date=12 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Preston|first1=John|title=Sir Terry Pratchett interview for Unseen Academicals|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/6231337/SIr-Terry-Pratchett-interview.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|access-date=12 March 2015}}</ref> When he travelled, he always took a portable computer with him to write.<ref name="writerswrite" />

In a 1995 interview with [[Microsoft]] co-founder [[Bill Gates]], Pratchett expressed concern about the potential spread of [[misinformation]] online. He felt that there was a "kind of parity of esteem of information" on the internet, and gave the example of [[holocaust denial]] being presented on the same terms as [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] research, with no easy way to gauge reliability. Gates disagreed, saying that online authorities would index and check facts and sources in a much more sophisticated way than in print. The interview was rediscovered in 2019, and seen by Pratchett's biographer as prescient of [[fake news]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/30/terry-pratchett-predicted-rise-of-fake-news-in-1995-says-biographer |title=Terry Pratchett predicted rise of fake news in 1995, says biographer |newspaper=The Guardian  |author=Alison Flood |date= 30 May 2019}}</ref>

Pratchett was an avid [[video game]] player, and collaborated in the creation of a number of game adaptations of his books. He favoured games that are "intelligent and have some depth", citing ''[[Half-Life 2]]'' (2004) and fan missions from ''[[Thief (series)|Thief]]'' as examples.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=PC Zone Staff|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=143656|title=PC Interviews – Terry Pratchett|date=1 August 2006|access-date=8 June 2007}}</ref> The red army in ''Interesting Times'' prompts comparisons to the game ''[[Lemmings (video game)|Lemmings]]''. When asked about this connection, Pratchett stated, "Merely because the red army can fight, dig, march and climb and is controlled by little icons? Can't imagine how anyone thought that&nbsp;... Not only did I wipe ''Lemmings'' from my hard disk, I overwrote it so I couldn't get it back."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lspace.org/books/apf/interesting-times.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120804004433/http://www.lspace.org/books/apf/interesting-times.html |archive-date= 4 August 2012 |title=Annotated Pratchett File v 9.0 – Interesting Times |date=1 July 2005 |access-date=10 December 2014 |work=LSpace |first=Leo |last=Breebaart |url-status=live }}</ref> He described ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'' (2006) as his favorite video game in a 2009 interview and stated that he used many of its non-combat-oriented fan-made [[Mod (video games)|mods]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Peterson|first1=Matthew|title=Terry Pratchett|url=http://theauthorhour.com/terry-pratchett/extras.php|website=The Author Hour|access-date=16 April 2015}}</ref> Pratchett wrote dialogue for an ''Oblivion'' mod which added a Nord companion named Vilja.

===Natural history===
Pratchett had a fascination with [[natural history]] that he referred to many times, and he owned a greenhouse full of [[carnivorous plant]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A4643895 |title=BBC profile |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |access-date=3 December 2012}}</ref> He described them in the biographical notes on the dust jackets of some of his books, and elsewhere,<ref>Alt.Fan.Pratchett FAQ| http://faqs.cs.uu.nl/na-dir/pratchett/afp-faq.html seen November 2019</ref> as "not as interesting as people think".<ref>{{cite book |last=Pratchett |first=Terry |author-link=Terry Pratchett |date=1990 |title=The Colour of Magic|publisher=Corgi}}</ref>  By ''Carpe Jugulum'' the account had become that "he used to grow carnivorous plants, but now they've taken over the greenhouse and he avoids going in."<ref>Biographical note, inside rear dustcover flap, ''Carpe Jugulum'' {{ISBN|0-385-40992-3}}</ref>

In 1995, a [[fossil]] [[turtle|sea-turtle]] from the [[Eocene]] epoch of [[New Zealand]] was named ''[[Psephophorus terrypratchetti]]'' in his honour by the palaeontologist Richard Köhler.<ref name="koehler1995">{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/03014223.1995.9517495 |author=Köhler, R. |year=1995 |title=A new species of the fossil turtle ''Psephophorus'' (Order Testudines) from the Eocene of the South Island, New Zealand |journal=[[Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand]] |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=371–384}}</ref>

In 2016, Pratchett fans petitioned the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) to name [[chemical element]] 117, [[placeholder name|temporarily called]] ''ununseptium'', as ''octarine'' with the proposed symbol Oc (pronounced "ook").<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/authors/terry-pratchetts-discworld-colour-octarine-could-join-the-period/|work=The Telegraph|title=Terry Pratchett's Discworld colour Octarine could join the periodic table|first=Tristram Fane|last=Saunders|date=8 January 2016}}</ref> The final name chosen for element 117 was ''[[tennessine]]'' with the symbol Ts.<ref name="IUPAC-20161130">{{cite news |author=Staff |title=IUPAC Announces the Names of the Elements 113, 115, 117, and 118|url=https://iupac.org/iupac-announces-the-names-of-the-elements-113-115-117-and-118/ |date=30 November 2016 |work=[[IUPAC]] |access-date=1 December 2016 }}</ref>

Pratchett wrote that he read the [[Old Testament]] as a child and "was horrified", but liked the [[New Testament]] and thought that Jesus "had a lot of good things to say ... But I could never see the two testaments as one coherent narrative."<ref name=":1" /> He then read [[On the Origin of Species|''On'' ''the Origin of Species'']], which "all made perfect sense ...

Pratchett told the ''Times'' in 2008: "I believe in the same God that [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] did ... And it is just possible that once you have got past all the gods that we have created with big beards and many human traits, just beyond all that on the other side of physics, there just may be the ordered structure from which everything flows."<ref name=":2" /> In an interview on ''[[Front Row (radio programme)|Front Row]],'' he described an experience hearing his deceased father's voice and feeling a sense of peace.<ref>{{Cite episode|number=1 September 2008|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00d6tjk|title=Front Row|series=Front Row|series-link=Front Row (radio programme)|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC Radio 4]]|date=1 September 2008}}</ref> Commentators took these statements to mean Pratchett had become religious; Pratchett responded in an article published in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' in which he denied that he had found God, and clarified that he believed the "voice in his head" had come from a memory of his father and sense of personal elation.<ref name=":1" />

In 2003, [[BBC]] conducted [[The Big Read]] to identify the "Nation's Best-loved Novel" and finally published a ranked list of the "Top 200". Pratchett's highest-ranking novel was ''Mort'', number 65, but he and [[Charles Dickens]] were the only authors with five in the Top 100 (four of his were from the ''[[Discworld]]'' series).

Comic adventures that fondly mock the fantasy genre, the Discworld novels expose the hypocrisies of contemporary society in an intricate, ever-expanding universe. With satisfyingly multilayered plots, Pratchett's humor honors the intelligence of the reader. Teens eagerly lose themselves in a universe with no maps."<ref name=edwards/>

==Writing==
Pratchett said that to write, you must read extensively, both inside and outside your chosen genre<ref name="locus">{{cite web|publisher=Locus Online|url=http://www.locusmag.com/2004/Issues/05Pratchett.html|title=Terry Pratchett: 21 Years of Discworld|date=May 2004|access-date=17 February 2008}}</ref> and to the point of "overflow".<ref name="writerswrite"/> He advised that writing is hard work, and that writers must "make grammar, punctuation and spelling a part of your life."<ref name="writerswrite"/> However, Pratchett enjoyed writing, regarding its monetary rewards as "an unavoidable consequence" rather than the reason for writing.<ref name="sffworld">{{cite web|publisher=Sffworld.com|url=http://www.sffworld.com/interview/52p1.html|title=Interview with Terry Pratchett|date=18 December 2002|access-date=17 February 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206011559/http://www.sffworld.com/interview/52p1.html|archive-date=6 December 2008}}</ref>

===Fantasy genre===
Although during his early career he wrote for the sci-fi and horror genres, Pratchett later focused almost entirely on fantasy, and said: "It is easier to bend the universe around the story."<ref name="IRCchat">{{cite web|publisher=Lspace.org|url=http://www.lspace.org/about-terry/interviews/WFC.html|title=Transcript of IRC interview with Terry Pratchett at the World Fantasy Convention by James Webley|date=n.d.|access-date=8 June 2007}}</ref> In the acceptance speech for his Carnegie Medal he said: "Fantasy isn't just about wizards and silly wands. It's about seeing the world from new directions", pointing to J. K. Rowling's ''[[Harry Potter]]'' novels and J. R. R. Tolkien's ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. In the same speech, he acknowledged benefits of these works for the genre.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pratchett wins first major award|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2124520.stm|access-date=28 January 2008|date=12 July 2002}}</ref>

Pratchett believed he owed "a debt to the science fiction/fantasy genre which he grew up out of" and disliked the term "[[magical realism]]" which, he said, is "like a polite way of saying you write fantasy and is more acceptable to certain people ... who, on the whole, do not care that much."<ref name="january2002">{{cite web|publisher=januarymagazine.com|url=http://januarymagazine.com/profiles/tpratchett2002.html|title=Terry Pratchett by Linda Richards|year=2002|access-date=17 February 2008}}</ref> He expressed annoyance that fantasy is "unregarded as a literary form", arguing that it "is the oldest form of fiction";<ref name="january1997"/> he described himself as "infuriated" when novels containing science fiction or fantasy ideas were not regarded as part of those genres.<ref name="locus"/> He debated this issue with novelist [[A. S. Byatt]] and critic [[Terry Eagleton]], arguing that fantasy is fundamental to the way we understand the world and therefore an integral aspect of all fiction.<ref name="may2013">{{cite web|publisher=iai.tv|url=http://iai.tv/video/at-the-world-s-edge|title=At the World's Edge|year=2013|access-date=6 December 2013}}</ref>

On 31 July 2005, Pratchett criticised media coverage of ''Harry Potter'' author [[J. K. Rowling]], commenting that certain members of the media seemed to think that "the continued elevation of J. K. Rowling can be achieved only at the expense of other writers".<ref name="Scotsman">{{cite news|title=Pratchett takes swipe at Rowling|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4732385.stm|access-date=28 January 2008|date=31 July 2005}}</ref> Pratchett later denied claims that this was a swipe at Rowling, and said that he was not making claims of plagiarism, but was pointing out the "shared heritage" of the fantasy genre.<ref name="alternativenation">{{cite web|publisher=Terry Pratchett Books (originally Alternative Nation)|url=http://www.terrypratchettbooks.org/pratchett-and-discworld-articles/interview-terry-pratchett.html|title=Interview: Terry Pratchett|date=10 October 2005|access-date=12 August 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123004903/http://www.terrypratchettbooks.org/pratchett-and-discworld-articles/interview-terry-pratchett.html|archive-date=23 November 2010}}</ref> Pratchett also posted on the ''Harry Potter'' [[newsgroup]] about a media-covered exchange of views with her.<ref>{{cite newsgroup|title=Re: Pratchett comments on Rowling|author=Terry Pratchett|date=1 August 2005|newsgroup=alt.fan.harry-potter|url=http://groups.google.com/group/alt.fan.harry-potter/msg/c4d91c122d8d07f1|access-date=27 January 2008}}</ref>

===Style and themes===
Pratchett is known for a distinctive writing style that included a number of characteristic hallmarks. One example is his use of [[footnote]]s,<ref>{{cite web|publisher=William Denton, Miskatonic.org|url=http://www.miskatonic.org/footnotes.html|title=Fictional Footnotes and Indexes – Fiction with Footnotes|date=22 March 2007|access-date=7 June 2007}}</ref> which usually involve a comic departure from the narrative or a commentary on the narrative, and occasionally have footnotes of their own.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Robert Neumann, The L-Space Web|url=http://www.lspace.org/books/analysis/statistics.html#footnotes|title=Statistics – Footnotes|date=n.d.|access-date=9 June 2007}}</ref>

Pratchett's earliest Discworld novels were written largely to parody classic sword-and-sorcery fiction (and occasionally science-fiction);<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N59OCI6iSA8C&pg=PA1|title=He Do the Time Police in Different Voices|last=Langford|first=David|date=1 January 2003|publisher=Wildside Press LLC|isbn=9781592240586|pages=16|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5jhQBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA101|title=Ideological Battlegrounds – Constructions of Us and Them Before and After 9/11 Volume 1: Perspectives in Literatures and Cultures|last=Guttfeld|first=Dorota|date=16 October 2014|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=9781443869171|editor-last=Witkowska|editor-first=Joanna|pages=101|language=en|chapter=Us and Them in Terry Pratchett's Pre- and Post-9/11 Discworld|quote=Others [...] are naturally defined by the series' origins as a thinly disguised parody of fantasy.|editor-last2=Zagratzki|editor-first2=Uwe}}</ref> as the series progressed, Pratchett dispensed with parody almost entirely, and the Discworld series evolved into straightforward (though still comedic) satire.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_t9LDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA138|title=Terry Pratchett's Narrative Worlds: From Giant Turtles to Small Gods|last=Rana|first=Marion|date=12 February 2018|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319672984|pages=138 ff|language=en}}</ref>

Pratchett had a tendency to avoid using chapters, arguing in a [[IndieBound|Book Sense]] interview that "life does not happen in regular chapters, nor do movies, and [[Homer]] did not write in chapters", adding "I'm blessed if I know what function they serve in books for adults."<ref name="indiebound">{{cite web|publisher=Gavin J. Grant, IndieBound.com|url=http://www.indiebound.org/author-interviews/pratchettterry|title=Terry Pratchett|date=n.d.
| access-date =18 December 2008}}</ref> However, there were exceptions; ''[[Going Postal]]'' and ''[[Making Money]]'' and several of his books for younger readers are divided into chapters.<ref name="words from master">{{cite web|publisher=Terry Pratchett, The L-Space Web|url=http://www.lspace.org/books/apf/words-from-the-master.html|title=Words from the Master|date=n.d.|access-date=16 December 2007}}</ref> Pratchett offered explanations for his sporadic use of chapters; in the young adult titles, he said that he must use chapters because '[his] editor screams until [he] does', but otherwise felt that they were an unnecessary 'stopping point' that got in the way of the narrative.

Characters, place names, and titles in Pratchett's books often contain puns, allusions and cultural references.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=William T. Abbott|url=http://www.lspace.org/books/analysis/bill-abbott.html|title=White Knowledge and the Cauldron of Story: The Use of Allusion in Terry Pratchett's Discworld|date=May 2002|access-date=7 June 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=David Bapst|url=http://www.lspace.org/books/analysis/david-bapst.html|title=The Literary Evolution of Terry Pratchett|date=1 June 2002|access-date=7 June 2007}}</ref> Some characters are parodies of well-known characters: for example, Pratchett's character [[Cohen the Barbarian]], also called Ghengiz Cohen, is a parody of [[Conan the Barbarian]] and [[Genghis Khan]], and his character Leonard of Quirm is a parody of [[Leonardo da Vinci]].

Another hallmark of his writing was the use of capitalised dialogue without quotation marks, used to indicate the character of Death communicating [[telepathic]]ally into a character's mind. Other characters or types of characters were given similarly distinctive ways of speaking, such as the auditors of reality not having quotation marks around the words they speak, Ankh-Morpork [[grocer's apostrophe|grocers never using punctuation correctly]], and Golems Capitalising Each Word In Everything They Say. Also, common spelling mistakes were used to indicate a person's level of literacy.

Pratchett made up a new colour, [[octarine]], a 'fluorescent greenish-yellow-purple', which is the eighth colour in the ''Discworld'' spectrum—the colour of magic.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pratchett|first=Terry|author2=Stephen Briggs|title=The New Discworld Companion|publisher=[[Victor Gollancz Ltd]]|year=2003|location=London|page=301|url=http://www.orionbooks.co.uk/PB-25621/The-New-Discworld-Companion.htm|isbn=0-575-07467-1|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706012335/http://www.orionbooks.co.uk/PB-25621/The-New-Discworld-Companion.htm|archive-date=6 July 2008}}</ref> Indeed, the number eight itself is regarded in the Discworld as being a magical number; for example, the eighth son of an eighth son will be a wizard, and his eighth son will be a "sourcerer", extremely powerful users of magic with abilities far beyond what most wizards usually achieve (which is one reason why wizards are not allowed to have children).<ref>{{cite book|last=Pratchett|first=Terry|title=Equal Rites|publisher = [[Victor Gollancz Ltd]]|year=1987|location=London|page=224|isbn=0-575-03950-7}}</ref>

Discworld novels often included a modern innovation and its introduction to the world's [[medieval]] setting, such as a public police force (''[[Guards! Guards!]]''), guns (''[[Men at Arms]]''), submarines (''[[Jingo (novel)|Jingo]]''), cinema (''[[Moving Pictures (novel)|Moving Pictures]]''), investigative journalism (''[[The Truth (novel)|The Truth]]''), the postage stamp (''[[Going Postal]]''), modern banking (''[[Making Money]]''), and the steam engine (''[[Raising Steam]]''). The "clacks", the tower-to-tower [[semaphore line|semaphore system]] that sprang up in later novels, is a mechanical optical telegraph (as created by the [[Claude Chappe|Chappe brothers]] and employed during the [[French revolution]]) before wired electric telegraph chains, with all the change and turmoil that such an advancement implies. The resulting social upheaval driven by these changes serves as the setting for the main story.

===Influences===
Pratchett made no secret of outside influences on his work: they were a major source of his humour. He imported numerous characters from classic literature, popular culture and ancient history,<ref>{{cite episode|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/arts/bookclub/ram/bookclub_20040704.ram |title=Terry Pratchett – Mort|series=Bookclub|airdate=7 July 2004|season=7th|number=7}}</ref> always adding an unexpected twist. Pratchett was a crime novel fan, which was reflected in frequent appearances of the [[Ankh-Morpork City Watch]] in the ''Discworld'' series.<ref name="IRCchat"/> Pratchett was an [[only child]], and his characters are often without siblings. Pratchett explained, "In fiction, only-children are the interesting ones".<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Times Online|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/article552415.ece|title=Parenting: Only need not mean lonely|date=7 August 2005|access-date=8 June 2007 | location=London|first=David|last=Robertson}}</ref>

Pratchett's earliest inspirations were ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'' by [[Kenneth Grahame]], and the works of [[Isaac Asimov]] and [[Arthur C. Clarke]].<ref name="guardian"/> His literary influences were [[P.G. Wodehouse]], [[Tom Sharpe]], [[Jerome K.

===Publishing history===
While Pratchett's UK publishing history remained quite stable, his relationships with international publishers were turbulent (especially in America). He changed German publishers after an advertisement for [[Maggi]] soup appeared in the middle of the German-language version of ''Pyramids''.<ref name="Saurio interview">{{cite web|publisher=laideafija.com.ar|url=http://www.laideafija.com.ar/especiales/pratchett/PRATCHETT_interview.html|title=Saurio interviews Terry Pratchett|year=2002|access-date=19 November 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118024258/http://www.laideafija.com.ar/especiales/pratchett/PRATCHETT_interview.html|archive-date=18 January 2012}}</ref><ref name="Heyne covers">{{cite web|publisher=colinsmythe.co.uk|url=http://www.colinsmythe.co.uk/terrypages/heynecovers.htm|title=Heyne Covers|date=25 May 2005|access-date=15 March 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020140752/http://www.colinsmythe.co.uk/terrypages/heynecovers.htm|archive-date=20 October 2007}}</ref>

===''Discworld''===
{{Main|Discworld}}
Pratchett began writing the ''Discworld'' series in 1983 to "have fun with some of the cliches"<ref name="sfw"/> and it is a [[humour|humorous]] and often [[satirical]] sequence of stories set in the colourful fantasy [[Discworld (world)|Discworld universe]]. The series contains various [[Discworld reading order|story arcs]] (or sub-series), and a number of free-standing stories. All are set in an abundance of locations in the same detailed and unified world, such as the [[Unseen University]] and 'The Drum/Broken Drum/Mended Drum' [[public house]] in the twin city Ankh-Morpork, or places in the various continents, regions and countries on the Disc. Characters and locations reappear throughout the series, variously taking major and minor roles.

The Discworld is a large disc resting on the backs of four giant elephants, all supported by the giant turtle [[Great atuin|Great A'Tuin]] as it swims its way through space. The books are essentially in chronological order,<ref name="words from master"/> and advancements can be seen in the development of the Discworld civilisations, such as the creation of paper money in Ankh-Morpork.<ref name="indiebound"/>

Many of the novels in Pratchett's Discworld series [[parody]] real-world subjects such as [[film|film making]], [[newspaper]] publishing, [[rock and roll]] music, [[religion]], [[philosophy]], [[Ancient Greece]], [[Egyptian history]], the [[Gulf War]], [[Australia]], university politics, [[trade union]]s, and the financial world. Pratchett also included further parody as a feature within the stories, including such subjects as [[Ingmar Bergman]] films, numerous fiction, [[science fiction]], and [[fantasy]] characters, and various bureaucratic and ruling systems.

====''The Science of Discworld''====
Pratchett wrote four ''Science of Discworld'' books in collaboration with Professor of mathematics [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] and reproductive biologist [[Jack Cohen (biologist)|Jack Cohen]], both of the [[University of Warwick]]: ''[[The Science of Discworld]]'' (1999), ''[[The Science of Discworld II: The Globe]]'' (2002), ''[[The Science of Discworld III: Darwin's Watch]]'' (2005), and ''[[The Science of Discworld IV: Judgement Day]]'' (2013).

All four books have chapters that alternate between fiction and non-fiction: the fictional chapters are set within the [[Discworld (world)|Discworld universe]], where [[Discworld characters|characters]] observe, and experiment on, a universe with the same physics as ours. The non-fiction chapters (written by Stewart and Cohen) explain the science behind the fictional events.

In 1999, Pratchett appointed both Cohen and Stewart as "Honorary Wizards of the Unseen University" at the same ceremony at which the [[University of Warwick]] awarded him an honorary degree.<ref name="warwick"/>

====''Folklore of Discworld''====
Pratchett collaborated with the folklorist Dr [[Jacqueline Simpson]] on ''[[The Folklore of Discworld]]'' (2008), a study of the relationship between many of the persons, places and events described in the Discworld books and their counterparts in myths, legends, fairy tales and folk customs on Earth.

===Other writing===
Pratchett's first two adult novels, ''[[The Dark Side of the Sun]]'' (1976) and ''[[Strata (novel)|Strata]]'' (1981), were both science-fiction, the latter taking place partly on a disc-shaped world. Subsequent to these, Pratchett mostly concentrated on his ''Discworld'' series and novels for children, with two exceptions: ''[[Good Omens]]'' (1990), a collaboration with [[Neil Gaiman]] (which was nominated for both Locus and World Fantasy Awards in 1991<ref name="WWE-1991">{{cite web| url = http://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_year_index.asp?year=1991| title = 1991 Award Winners & Nominees| work = Worlds Without End| access-date=29 June 2009}}</ref>), a humorous story about the Apocalypse set on Earth, and ''[[Nation (novel)|Nation]]'' (2008), a book for young adults.

After writing ''Good Omens'', Pratchett brainstormed with [[Larry Niven]] on a story that would become the short novel "[[Rainbow Mars]]". Niven eventually completed the story on his own, but states in the afterword that a number of Pratchett's ideas remained in the finished version.

Pratchett also collaborated with British science fiction author [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]] on a parallel earth series.<ref name="announce">{{cite web|url=http://www.sfx.co.uk/2010/06/16/terry-pratchett-and-stephen-baxter-collaborating-on-the-long-earth/ |title=The Long Earth |publisher=SFX |access-date=18 July 2012}}</ref> The first novel, entitled ''[[The Long Earth]]'' was released on 21 June 2012. A second novel, ''[[The Long War (novel)|The Long War]]'', was released on 18 June 2013.<ref>{{cite news|title=Terry Pratchett, Stephen Baxter – The Long War (The Long Earth 2) announced|url=http://upcoming4.me/news/book-news/terry-pratchett-stephen-baxter-the-long-war-the-long-earth-2-announced|access-date=15 January 2013|newspaper=Upcoming4.me|date=15 January 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615021400/http://upcoming4.me/news/book-news/terry-pratchett-stephen-baxter-the-long-war-the-long-earth-2-announced|archive-date=15 June 2013}}</ref> ''[[The Long Mars]]'' was published in 2014. The fourth book in the series, ''[[The Long Utopia]]'', was published in June 2015, and the fifth, ''[[The Long Cosmos]]'', in June 2016.

In 2012, the first volume of Pratchett's collected short fiction was published under the title ''[[A Blink of the Screen]]''. In 2014, a similar collection was published of Pratchett's non-fiction, entitled ''[[A Slip of the Keyboard]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/terry-pratchett/a-slip-of-the-keyboard/|publisher=kirkusreviews.com|title=A Slip of the Keyboard|access-date=29 December 2014}}</ref>

=== Children's literature ===
Pratchett's first children's novel was also his first published novel: ''[[The Carpet People]]'' in 1971, which Pratchett substantially rewrote and re-released in 1992. The next, ''Truckers'' (1988), was the first in ''[[The Nome Trilogy]]'' of novels for young readers (also known as ''The Bromeliad Trilogy''), about small [[gnome]]-like creatures called "Nomes", and the trilogy continued in ''Diggers'' (1990) and ''Wings'' (1990). Subsequently, Pratchett wrote the ''[[Johnny Maxwell]]'' trilogy, about the adventures of a boy called Johnny Maxwell and his friends, comprising ''[[Only You Can Save Mankind]]'' (1992), ''[[Johnny and the Dead]]'' (1993) and ''[[Johnny and the Bomb]]'' (1996).
''[[Nation (novel)|Nation]]'' (2008) marked his return to the non-Discworld children's novel, and this was followed in 2012 by ''[[Dodger (novel)|Dodger]]'', a children's novel set in Victorian London.<ref>{{cite book|title=Dodger: Amazon.co.uk: Terry Pratchett: Books |date=2 January 2011 |id={{ASIN|0385619278|country=uk}} }}</ref> On 21 November 2013 [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday Children's]] released Pratchett's ''Jack Dodger's Guide to London''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://upcoming4.me/news/book-news/terry-pratchett-jack-dodgers-guide-to-london-cover-art-and-synopsis-reveal |title=Terry Pratchett – Jack Dodger's Guide to London cover art and synopsis reveal |publisher=Upcoming4.me |date=28 June 2013 |access-date=28 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702191408/http://upcoming4.me/news/book-news/terry-pratchett-jack-dodgers-guide-to-london-cover-art-and-synopsis-reveal |archive-date=2 July 2013 }}</ref>

In September 2014 a collection of children's stories, ''Dragons at Crumbling Castle'', written by Pratchett, and illustrated by Mark Beech, was published.<ref name="Final Terry Pratchett stories to be published in September">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jul/07/terry-prachett-the-time-travelling-caveman-published-september| title=Final Terry Pratchett stories to be published in September|last=Flood|first=Alison|date=7 July 2020|work=[[The Guardian]]| access-date=16 August 2020}}</ref> This was followed by another collection, ''The Witch's Vacuum Cleaner'', also illustrated by Mark Beech, in 2016.

Terry's long term assistant Rob Wilkins stated that Terry was working on this documentary before he died, and according to the BBC, finishing it would "show the author was still having the last laugh".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bucksfreepress.co.uk/news/15049908.Landmark_Sir_Terry_Pratchett_documentary_partly_filmed_at_BFP_offices_to_air_next_month/|title=Landmark Sir Terry Pratchett documentary partly filmed at BFP offices to air next month|website=Bucks Free Press}}</ref>
