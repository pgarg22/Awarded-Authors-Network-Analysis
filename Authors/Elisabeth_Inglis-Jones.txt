The house was demolished in 1953.<ref name=gwales>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gwales.com/goto/biblio/en/9781909983359/ |title=Welsh Women's Classics: Crumbling Pageant, Elisabeth Inglis-Jones |publisher=gwales.com |access-date=15 April 2016 |language=}}</ref><ref name=ceredigion>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ceredigion.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=7566 |title=Inglis-Jones, Elizabeth |publisher=Ceredigion County Council |access-date=15 April 2016 |language=}}</ref>

==Literary career==
Inglis-Jones took up writing as a child, joining a literary group called The Scratch Society when she was 12 or 13. She spent almost three years writing her first novel, ''Starved Fields'', which was published in 1929. Her often reprinted ''Peacocks in Paradise'' (1950, republished 1990) tells of [[Hafod Uchtryd|Hafod]], a historic Welsh mansion, and its first owner [[Thomas Johnes]] (1748–1815).<ref name=cambrian/> Her five other novels were ''Crumbling Pageant'' (1932, republished 2015), ''Pay Thy Pleasure'' (1939), ''The Loving Heart'' (1942), ''Lightly He Journeyed'' (1946), and ''Aunt Albinia'' (1948).<ref name=ceredigion/>

Her works on Welsh history included ''The Story of Wales'' (1955), describing houses demolished since 1900. Among her biographies was ''The Great Maria'' (1959), about the writer [[Maria Edgeworth]], ''The Lord of Burghley'' (1964) on [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley]] and ''Augustus Smith of Scilly'' (1964) on the 19th-century [[Augustus Smith (politician)|proprietor of the Isles of Scilly]].<ref name=cambrian/>

Jane Bowden, reviewing a revival of ''Crumbling Pageant'', praised Inglis-Jones's "undeniable talent for story-telling, characterisation and lifelong passion for Wales", qualifying her as a "great Welsh woman writer".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.newwelshreview.com/article.php?id=1091 |title=Crumbling Pageant |author=Bowden, Jane |publisher=New Welsh Review |access-date=16 April 2016 |language=}}</ref>
