'''Blaga Nikolova Dimitrova''' ({{lang-bg|Блага Димитрова}}) (2 January 1922 – 2 May 2003) was a [[Bulgaria]]n poet and the 2nd [[Vice President of Bulgaria]]<ref>[http://www.president.bg/en/inst_izbori_92.php Official results from the 1992 Bulgarian Presidential Election]</ref> from 1992 until 1993.

==Life==

Born in [[Byala Slatina]] to a mother teacher and a father lawyer, Blaga Dimitrova was raised in [[Veliko Tarnovo]] and then moved to Sofia. She finished High School in 1942, and Slavic Philology at the [[University of Sofia]] in 1945.

In the 1970s, her works became more critical of the communist government, and she received reprimands for not being politically correct. Four of the poetry books Dimitrova wrote in the 1970s- "Fireflies Fading", "Rubber Plant", "Questions", and "Hobbyada"- were all rejected by state publishing houses with no specific reason given.<ref>[http://www.thefileroom.org/documents/dyn/DisplayCase.cfm/id/1120 Thefileroom.org]</ref>

Blaga Dimitrova was the inspiration behind [[John Updike]]'s short story "[[The Bulgarian Poetess]]".<ref>[http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/300/8/3/text/7-5-256.shtml A Major Literary Event: The Novel "Avalanche"<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

During the [[Vietnam War]], Dimitrova visited the country several times as a journalist, and in 1967 adopted a Vietnamese girl. Dimitrova was married to literary critic [[Jordan Vasilev]].

She died on 2 May 2003.
