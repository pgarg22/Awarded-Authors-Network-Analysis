== Early life and education ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}

Momen was born on 25 November 1908. His father was Nurul Arefin, a physician and Zamindar (landlord) in Alfadanga, of the then [[Jessore District|Jessore]] district. (After the partition of India, from 1947, Alphadanga is in [[Faridpur district]].)  He went to primary school in [[Calcutta]] and was admitted in 1916 into Khulna Zila School. At the age of ten he wrote his first poem, ''Shondhya'' (Evening), in the same verse as [[Tagore]]'s ''Shonar Tory''. In 1919 it was published in the journal ''Dhrubotara''. In 1920, he was enrolled in the [[Muslim Government High School|Dhaka Muslim High School]] where he resided in the Dafrin Hostel. After matriculation in 1924 he studied at [[Dhaka Collegiate School|Dhaka Intermediate College]]. Passing intermediate, he enrolled for a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] at the newly established [[Dhaka University]] in 1926.

While he was residing at "Muslim Hall" of Dhaka University, the various halls staged the then new play ''[[Muktadhara]]'' by [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. After some initial resistance, Momen received the main role of "Botu". This ignited his passion for drama and even earned him the first prize, but it was also the first time that he performed as actor himself.

After receiving his B.A. from Dhaka University in 1929, he studied law at the [[Department of Law, University of Calcutta]]. Upon completing his [[B.L.]] examinations in 1936 he started practicing at the [[Calcutta High Court]].

==Career==

=== Radio work ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}

After the foundation of [[All India Radio]] in Dhaka, 1939, Momen picked up on the opportunity of the new medium and became its first Muslim author. In 1941 he wrote and directed the comedy ''Rupantor'' (Transformation) for the radio. With its progressive plot and a female main character it differed vastly form traditional Muslim plays and was actually the first modern drama of Bangladesh. Upon initiative of the critic, the poet and literary critic [[Mohitlal Majumder]], the play was also published in the yearly [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]] issue of the newspaper [[Anandabazar]].

While he was in London for higher studies from 1948 on, Nurul Momen and his friend Nazir Ahmed started a [[BBC]] Bengali program, a weekly one-hour format called'' Anjuman'' where Momen was responsible for the literary content.

=== Teaching career ===
Rather than continuing to practice law even before the [[partition of India]], Momen joined the faculty of Law at the Dhaka University in 1945.<ref name=Banglapedia>{{cite book |last=Mahmud |first=Faisal |year=2012 |chapter=Momen, Nurul |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Momen,_Nurul |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}</ref> There he was known for including elements from literature and music into the law classes. [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] was one of his favourite students, who enrolled in that department in 1948. He encouraged [[Munier Choudhury|Munier Chowdhury]] to get interested in theater and become a playwright. Momen encouraged him to read [[George Bernard Shaw]] and got many other students interested in theatre. He later translated ''[[You Never Can Tell (play)|You Never Can Tell]]''. From 1948 until 1951 Momen was on leave from the university, undergoing higher studies in England and graduating in Law from London University.
