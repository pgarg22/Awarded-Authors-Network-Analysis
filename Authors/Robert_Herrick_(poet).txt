'''Robert Herrick''' (baptised 24 August 1591 – buried 15 October 1674)<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Herrick, Robert |volume=13 |pages=389&ndash;390 |last1= Gosse |first1=Edmund William |author-link=Edmund William Gosse}}</ref> was a 17th-century English [[lyric poetry|lyric]] poet and [[clergy|cleric]]. He is best known for ''[[Hesperides (poetry)|Hesperides]]'', a book of poems. This includes the ''[[carpe diem]]'' poem "[[To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time]]", with the first line "Gather ye rosebuds while ye may".

==Early life==
Born in [[Cheapside]], London, Robert Herrick was the seventh child and fourth son of Julia Stone and Nicholas Herrick, a prosperous goldsmith.<ref name=poetsrh>"Robert Herrick," Poets.org, Academy of American Poets, Web, 20 May 2011.</ref> He was named after an uncle, Robert Herrick (or Heyrick), a prosperous [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Leicester (UK Parliament constituency)|Leicester]], who had bought the land [[Greyfriars, Leicester|Greyfriars Abbey]] stood on after [[Henry VIII]]'s [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolution]] in the mid-16th century. Nicholas Herrick died in a fall from a fourth-floor window in November 1592, when Robert was a year old (whether this was suicide remains unclear).<ref name=lumin>"[http://www.luminarium.org/sevenlit/herrick/herribio.htm Robert Herrick]," Luminarium.org, Web, 20 May 2011.</ref>

The tradition that Herrick received his education at [[Westminster School|Westminster]] is based on the words "beloved Westminster" in his poem "Tears to Thamesis", but the allusion is to the city, not the school.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Works of Robert Herrick: The Hesperides and Noble Numbers |publisher=George Routledge and Sons (The Muses' Library) |author=Pollard, Alfred |year=1898 |chapter-url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/22421/22421-h/22421-h.htm |location=London |pages=xvii |chapter=Life of Herrick}}</ref> It is more likely that he, like his uncle's children, attended The [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylors' School]]. In 1607 he became apprenticed to his other uncle, [[William Herrick (MP)|Sir William Herrick]], a goldsmith and jeweller to the king. The apprenticeship ended after only six years, when Herrick, aged 22, gained admission at [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]], Cambridge. He later migrated to [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge|Trinity Hall]], graduating in 1617.<ref>{{acad |id=HRK613R |name=Herrick, Robert}}</ref> Herrick became a member of the [[Sons of Ben (literary group)|Sons of Ben]], a group centred on an admiration for the works of [[Ben Jonson]],<ref name=lumin/> to whom he wrote at least five poems. Herrick was ordained into the [[Church of England]] in 1623 and in 1629 became the vicar of [[Dean Prior]] in [[Devon|Devonshire]].<ref name=poetsrh/>

==Civil War==
In 1647, in the wake of the [[English Civil War]], Herrick was ejected from his vicarage for refusing the [[Solemn League and Covenant]].<ref name=verse>"Robert Herrick," EnglishVerse.com, Web, 20 May 2011.</ref> He returned to London to live in [[Westminster]] and depend on the charity of his friends and family. He spent some time preparing his lyric poems for publication and had them printed in 1648 under the title ''Hesperides; or the Works both Human and Divine of Robert Herrick'', with a dedication to the Prince of Wales.

==Restoration and later life==
When King Charles II was [[Stuart Restoration|restored to the throne in 1660]], Herrick petitioned for his own restoration to his living. He had obtained favour by writing verses celebrating the births of both Charles II and his brother James before the Civil War. Herrick became the vicar of Dean Prior again in the summer of 1662 and lived there until his death in October 1674, at the age of 83. His date of death is unknown, but he was buried on 15 October.

Herrick was a bachelor all his life. Many of the women he names in his poems are thought to be fictional.<ref>''Ben Jonson and the Cavalier Poets'', ed. Hugh Maclean (New York: Norton, 1974), p. 106.</ref>

==Poetic style and stature==
{{main|Hesperides (poetry)}}
[[Image:Robert Herrick Hesperides.jpg|thumb|Title page of ''Hesperides'' (1648)]]
Herrick wrote over 2,500 poems, about half of which appear in his major work, ''Hesperides''.<ref name=verse/> ''Hesperides'' also includes the much shorter ''Noble Numbers'', his first book of spiritual works, first published in 1648. He is well known for his style, and in his earlier works for frequent references to lovemaking and the female body. His later poetry was of a more spiritual and philosophical nature. Among his most famous short poetical sayings are the unique [[monometer]]s, such as number 475, "Thus I / Pass by / And die,/ As one / Unknown / And gone."

Herrick sets out his subject-matter in the poem he printed at the beginning of his collection, "The Argument of his Book". He dealt with English country life and its seasons, village customs, complimentary poems to various ladies and his friends, themes taken from classical writings, and a solid bedrock of Christian faith, not intellectualized but underpinning the rest. It has been said of Herrick's style that "his directness of speech with clear and simple presentation of thought, a fine artist working with conscious knowledge of his art, of an England of his youth in which he lives and moves and loves, clearly assigns him to the first place as a lyrical poet in the strict and pure sense of the phrase."<ref>[[Francis Palgrave|F. P. Palgrave]], ''A Selection of Lyrical Poems'', 1876.</ref>

Herrick never married and none of his love poems seems to connect directly with any one woman. He loved the richness of sensuality and the variety of life. This appears vividly in such poems as "Cherry-ripe", "Delight in Disorder" and "Upon Julia's Clothes".

The overriding message in Herrick's work is that life is short, the world beautiful and love splendid. We must use the short time we have to make the most of it. This message is clear in "To the Virgins, to make much of Time", "To Daffodils", "To Blossoms" and "Corinna's Going A Maying", where the warmth and exuberance of a seemingly kind and jovial personality comes over.

[[Image:Waterhouse-gather ye rosebuds-1909.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Gather Ye Rosebuds While Ye May (Waterhouse painting 1909)|Gather Ye rosebuds While Ye May]]'', by [[John William Waterhouse]], (1909)]]
The opening stanza in one of his more famous poems, "[[To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time]]", runs:
{{quote|<poem>Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,
Old Time is still a-flying;
And this same flower that smiles today,
Tomorrow will be dying.</poem>}}

This is an example of the [[carpe diem]] genre, whose popularity Herrick's poems helped to revive.

His poems were none too popular on publication. A style influenced by [[Ben Jonson]], the classical Roman writers and the late [[Elizabethan era]] must have seemed old-fashioned to an audience tuned to the complexities of [[metaphysical poets]] such as [[John Donne]] and [[Andrew Marvell]]. His work was rediscovered in the early 19th century and has been regularly printed since.<ref>{{Cite DNB |wstitle=Herrick, Robert |first=Arthur Henry |last=Bullen |volume=26}}</ref>

The Victorian poet [[Algernon Charles Swinburne|Swinburne]] described Herrick as "the greatest song writer ever born of English race".<ref>Mohit K. Ray, 2007. ''The Atlantic companion to literature in English''. New Delhi: Atlantic Publishers & Distributors. p. 245. {{ISBN|8126908327}}</ref> Despite his use of classical allusions and names, Herrick's poems are easier for modern readers than those of many of his contemporaries.

==In literature==
Herrick appears in [[James Branch Cabell]]'s "Concerning Corrina", published in his 1916 short-story volume ''The Certain Hour: Dizain des Poëtes''. The story strongly suggests that the poet was an [[adept]] of the [[Black magic|dark arts]]. Though technically a [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] or [[Horror fiction|horror]] story, it is best classed as a philosophical comedy.

Herrick is a major character in [[Rose Macaulay]]'s 1932 historical novel ''[[They Were Defeated]]''.

[[Samuel Beckett]]'s play ''[[Happy Days (play)|Happy Days]]'' has the character Winnie quote from Herrick's "To the Virgins to Make Much of Time".<ref>{{Cite book |title=Happy Days |last=Beckett |first=Samuel |publisher=Grove Press |year=2010 |isbn=9780802144409 |location=New York |pages=66}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=Happy Days: The Production Notebook of Samuel Beckett |last=Knowlson |first=James |publisher=Faber and Faber  |year=1985| location=London |pages=148–9}}</ref>

In [[Ken Bruen]]'s debut novel ''Rilke on Black'' makes Herrick's two-line poem "Dreams" a favorite with the protagonist Nick. Robert Herrick is one of many historical characters in the [[alternate history]] series ''[[1632 series|1632]]''. The dedication in [[Thomas Burnett Swann]]'s Will-o-the-Wisp (1976, {{ISBN|9780552103589}}) is "A novel suggested by the life of Robert Herrick, poet, vicar, and pagan". Herrick was referred to by the character Clement in HBO's 'Industry' (December 2020), in view of a candle on a birthday cake representing the passing of precious time.

==In music==
The first composers to set Herrick to music were near-contemporaries: at least 40 settings of 31 poems appear in manuscript and printed songbooks of 1624–1683, by [[Henry Lawes|Henry]] and [[William Lawes]], [[John Wilson (composer)|John Wilson]], [[Robert Ramsey (composer)|Robert Ramsey]] and others. It is clear from ''Hesperides'' that many other settings have not survived.<ref>Louise Schleiner. '[https://www.jstor.org/stable/43446862 Herrick's Songs and the Character of Hesperides]', in ''English Literary Renaissance'', Vol. 6, No. 1 (Winter 1976), pp. 77–91.</ref><ref>'[http://spenserians.cath.vt.edu/CommentRecord.php?action=GET&cmmtid=10650 To M. Henry Lawes, the excellent Composer of his Lyricks]', ''Hesperides'' (1648) p. 326.</ref> 

In the early 20th century Herrick's verse became popular with a range of composers.<ref>Richard Stokes, ''The Penguin Book of English Song'' (2016).</ref> One of them, [[Fritz Hart]], was by far the most prolific, with more than 120 settings composed throughout his life, mostly collected in ''Fourteen Songs'', Op. 10 (1912), ''Twenty-One Songs'', Op. 23 (1916), ''Twenty Five Songs'' in five sets, Opp. 50–54 (1922), ''Nine Sets of Four Songs Each'', Opp. 82–90 (1930), ''Three Sets of Five Songs'', Opp. 148–150 (1941), and ''Two Sets of Five Songs'', Opp. 166–167 (1948).<ref name=ban>Stephen Banfield.
