'''Richard Hathwaye''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 1597&ndash;1603), was an [[England|English]] [[dramatist]].

==Life==
Little is known about Hathwaye's life. There is no evidence that he was related to his namesake Richard Hathaway, the father of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s wife, [[Anne Hathaway (Shakespeare's wife)|Anne Hathaway]], though Richard's theatrical troupe ''"the Admiral's Men"'' was sponsored by Admiral [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham|Charles Howard]], the son in law of Sir [[Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon|Henry Carey]], [[Lord Chamberlain]] of England, the sponsor of William Shakespeare's theatrical troupe the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]]. Hathwaye is not heard of after 1603 and died in 1604 and is buried at St Boltophs without Aldgate London.

==Career as a dramatist==
Information on Hathwaye's dramatic career is derived mostly from the papers of [[Philip Henslowe]]. He wrote eighteen plays for Henslowe for production by the [[Admiral's Men]] and [[Worcester's Men]] at the [[Rose Theater]], both as sole author and in partnership with other playwrights who also produced copy for Henslowe. The first of these, ''King Arthur'' (1597), is the only play for which he received sole credit. He had likely already been writing for the stage for some time, however, since [[Francis Meres]] refers to him as if he was a veteran dramatist in 1598, including him among those "best for comedy."

Hathwaye also wrote [[commendatory verse]]s for [[John Bodenham]]'s ''Belvedere'', published in 1600.

Aside from his ''Belvedere'' verses all of Hathwaye's works are lost except for the first part of the collaborative ''[[Sir John Oldcastle]]'', commissioned as a counterblast to the negative depiction of the title character in the original versions of [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays ''[[Henry IV, part 1|Henry IV (Part 1)]]'' and ''[[Henry IV, part 2|Henry IV (Part 2)]]''. Objections from descendants of the historical [[John Oldcastle]], a [[Protestant]] martyr, appears to have been responsible both for the writing of the corrective ''Oldcastle'' play and the alteration of Oldcastle to [[Falstaff|Sir John Falstaff]] in later versions of the ''Henry IV'' plays.
