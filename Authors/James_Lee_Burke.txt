'''James Lee Burke''' (born December 5, 1936) is an American author, best known for his [[Dave Robicheaux]] series. He has won [[Edgar Award]]s for ''Black Cherry Blues'' (1990) and ''Cimarron Rose'' (1998), and has also been presented with the Grand Master Award from the [[Mystery Writers of America]]. The Robicheaux character has been portrayed twice on screen, first by [[Alec Baldwin]] (''[[Heaven's Prisoners]]'') and then [[Tommy Lee Jones]] (''[[In the Electric Mist]]'').

Wirt Williams, reviewing Burke's first novel, ''Half of Paradise'' (1965), in the ''New York Times'', compared his writing to [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]], but concluded "Mr. Burkes' literary forebear is [[Thomas Hardy]]."<ref>Wirt Williams, On the Tracks of Doom, ''The New York Times'', March 14, 1965</ref>  

Burke's 1982 novel, ''Two for Texas'', was made into a 1998 TV movie of the same name. Burke has also written five miscellaneous crime novels (including ''Two for Texas''), two short-story collections, four books starring protagonist [[Texas]] attorney Billy Bob Holland, four books starring Billy Bob's cousin Texas sheriff Hackberry Holland, and two books starring Weldon Avery Holland, grandson of legendary Texas lawman Hackberry Holland.

==Biography==
Burke was born in [[Houston]], Texas, but spent most of his childhood on the Texas-[[Louisiana]] [[Gulf Coast]]. He attended the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]] and [[University of Missouri]], receiving  bachelor of arts and  [[master of arts]] degrees in English literature from the latter.<ref name="gardenandgun.com">{{cite web|url=http://gardenandgun.com/article/southern-masters-james-lee-burke|title=Southern Masters: James Lee Burke|publisher=gardenandgun.com|access-date=December 3, 2017}}</ref>

He worked in a variety of jobs over the years, while books he had written were rejected, and books he had published went out of print. At various times, he worked as a truck driver for the [[U.S. Forest Service]], as a newspaper reporter, as a social worker on [[Skid Row, Los Angeles]], as a land surveyor in Colorado, in the Louisiana State unemployment system, and in the [[Job Corps]] in the [[Daniel Boone National Forest]] in eastern Kentucky.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wallacestroby.com/writersonwriting_burke.html|title=The Heartbreak Lounge|publisher=wallacestroby.com|access-date=April 30, 2017}}</ref><ref name="gardenandgun.com"/>
