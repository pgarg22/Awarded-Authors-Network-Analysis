'''Thomas Dekker''' (c. 1572 – 25 August 1632) was an English [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] dramatist and pamphleteer, a versatile and prolific writer, whose career spanned several decades and brought him into contact with many of the period's most famous dramatists.

==Early life==
Little is known of Dekker's early life or origins. From references in his pamphlets, Dekker is believed to have been born in London around 1572, but nothing is known for certain about his youth. His last name suggests [[Netherlands|Dutch]] ancestry, and his work, some of which is translated from [[Latin]], suggests that he attended [[grammar school]].

==Career==
Dekker embarked on a career as a theatre writer in the middle 1590s. His handwriting is found in the manuscript of ''[[Sir Thomas More (play)|Sir Thomas More]]'', though the date of his involvement is undetermined. More certain is his work as a playwright for the [[Admiral's Men]] of [[Philip Henslowe]], in whose account book he is first mentioned in early 1598. While there are plays connected with his name performed as early as 1594, it is not clear that he was the original author; his work often involved revision and updating. Between 1598 and 1602, he was involved in about forty plays for Henslowe, usually in collaboration. To these years belong the collaborations with [[Ben Jonson]] and [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]], which presumably contributed to the [[War of the Theatres]] in 1600 and 1601.  But Dekker is credited as the sole author of ''[[The Shoemaker's Holiday]]'' (1599), his acknowledged masterpiece – a boisterous, rowdy comedy of London life as seen through the eyes of a romanticist. [[Francis Meres]] includes Dekker in his list of notable playwrights in 1598.

For Jonson, however, Dekker was a bumbling hack, a "dresser of plays about town"; Jonson lampooned Dekker as Demetrius Fannius in ''Poetaster'' and as Anaides in ''Cynthia's Revels''. Dekker's riposte, ''Satiromastix'', performed both by the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]] and the [[boy player|child actors]] of Paul's, casts Jonson as an affected, hypocritical [[Horace]].

''Satiromastix'' marks the end of the "poetomachia"; in 1603, Jonson and Dekker collaborated again, on a pageant for the [[Royal Entry]], delayed from the [[coronation]] of [[James I of England|James I]], for which Dekker also wrote the [[festival book]] ''The Magnificent Entertainment''.<ref>[http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/BookDetails.aspx?strFest=0238 special-1.bl.uk]</ref> After this commission, however, the early Jacobean period was notably mixed for the author. In late 1602, he appears to have broken his association with Henslowe, for unknown reasons. He wrote for [[Worcester's Men]] for a time, then returned to the [[Admiral's Men]] (now patronized by [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince Henry]]) to produce ''The Honest Whore'', an apparent success. But the failures of ''The Whore of Babylon'' (1607) and ''If This Be Not a Good Play, the Devil is in It'' (1611) left him crestfallen; the latter play was rejected by Prince Henry's Men before failing for [[Queen Anne's Men]] at the [[Red Bull Theatre]].

==Legal troubles==
In 1612, Dekker's lifelong problem with debt (he had earlier, 1599, been imprisoned in [[Poultry Compter]]) reached a crisis when he was imprisoned in the [[King's Bench Prison]] on a debt of forty pounds to the father of [[John Webster]]. He remained there for seven years, and despite the support of associates such as [[Edward Alleyn]] and [[Endymion Porter]], these years were difficult; Dekker reports that the experience turned his hair white. He continued as pamphleteer throughout his years in prison.

==Later years==
On release, he resumed writing plays, now with collaborators both from his generation ([[John Day (dramatist)|John Day]] and [[John Webster]]) and slightly younger writers ([[John Ford (dramatist)|John Ford]] and [[Philip Massinger]]). Among these plays is one, ''Keep the Widow Waking'' (1624, with Ford, Webster, and [[William Rowley]]), which dramatized two recent murders in [[Whitechapel]]. In the latter half of the decade, Dekker turned once more to pamphlet-writing, revamping old work and writing a new preface to his most popular tract, ''The Bellman of London''.

==Death==
Dekker published no more work after 1632, and he is usually associated with the "Thomas Dekker, householder", who was buried at [[St James Church, Clerkenwell|St. James's]] in [[Clerkenwell]] that year.

==Work==

===Drama===
When Dekker began writing plays, [[Thomas Nashe]] and [[Thomas Lodge]] were still alive; when he died, [[John Dryden]] had already been born. Like most dramatists of the period, he adapted as well as he could to changing tastes; however, even his work in the fashionable Jacobean genres of satire and [[tragicomedy]] bears the marks of his Elizabethan training: its humour is genial, its action [[Romance (heroic literature)|romantic]]. The majority of his surviving plays are comedies or tragicomedies.

Most of Dekker's work is lost. His apparently disordered life, and his lack of a firm connection (such as [[Shakespeare]] or [[John Fletcher (playwright)|Fletcher]] had) with a single company, may have militated against the preservation or publication of manuscripts. Close to twenty of his plays were published during his lifetime; of these, more than half are comedies, with three significant tragedies: ''[[Lust's Dominion]]'' (presumably identical to ''The Spanish Moor's Tragedy'', written with Day, Marston, and [[William Haughton (playwright)|William Haughton]], 1600), ''[[The Witch of Edmonton]]'' (with Ford and Rowley, 1621), and ''[[The Virgin Martyr]]'' (with Massinger, 1620).

The first phase of Dekker's career is documented in Henslowe's diary. His name appears for the first time in connection with "fayeton" (presumably, [[Phaethon|Phaeton]]) in 1598. There follow, before 1599, payments for work on ''The Triplicity of Cuckolds'', ''The Mad Man's Morris'', and ''Hannibal and Hermes''.  He worked on these plays with [[Robert Wilson (dramatist)|Robert Wilson]], [[Henry Chettle]], and [[Michael Drayton]]. With Drayton, he also worked on history plays on the French civil wars, [[Godwin, Earl of Wessex|Earl Godwin]], and others. In 1599, he wrote plays on [[Troilus]] and [[Cressida]], [[Agamemnon]] (with Chettle), and ''Page of Plymouth''. In that year, also, he collaborated with Chettle, Jonson, and Marston on a play about [[Robert II of Scotland|Robert II]]. 1599 also saw the production of three plays that have survived. It was during this year that he produced his most famous work, ''[[The Shoemaker's Holiday]], or the Gentle Craft'', categorised by modern critics as citizen comedy. This play reflects his concerns with the daily lives of ordinary Londoners, and contains the poem [[The Merry Month of May (poem)|The Merry Month of May]]. This play exemplifies his intermingling of everyday subjects with the fantastical, embodied in this case by the rise of a craftsman to Mayor and the involvement of an unnamed but idealised king in the concluding banquet. ''[[Old Fortunatus]]'' and ''[[Patient Grissel]]'', the latter on the folkloric theme treated by [[Chaucer]] in [[The Clerk's Prologue and Tale|The Clerk's Tale]]. In 1600, he worked on ''The Seven Wise Masters'', ''Fortune's Tennis'', ''Cupid and Psyche'', and ''Fair Constance of Rome''. The next year, in addition to ''[[Satiromastix]]'', he worked on a play possibly about [[Sebastian of Portugal]] and ''[[Blurt, Master Constable]]'', on which he may have worked with [[Thomas Middleton]]. In 1602 he revised two older plays, ''Pontius Pilate'' (1597) and the second part of ''[[Sir John Oldcastle]]''. He also collaborated on ''Caesar's Fall'', ''Jephthah'', ''A Medicine for a Curst Wife'', [[Sir Thomas Wyatt (play)|''Sir Thomas Wyatt'']] (on [[Wyatt's rebellion]]), and ''Christmas Comes But Once a Year''.

Except for ''Blurt'', which was performed by the [[Children of the Chapel|Blackfriars Children]], the earlier of these works were performed at the Admiral's [[Fortune Playhouse|Fortune Theatre]]. After 1602, Dekker split his attention between pamphlets and plays; thus, his dramatic output decreased considerably. He and Middleton wrote ''[[The Honest Whore]]'' for the Fortune in 1604, and Dekker wrote a sequel himself the following year. The Middleton/Dekker collaboration [[The Family of Love (play)|''The Family of Love'']] also dates from this general era. Dekker and Webster wrote ''[[Westward Ho (play)|Westward Ho]]'' and ''[[Northward Ho]]'' for Paul's Boys.  The failures of the anti-Catholic ''Whore of Babylon'' and tragicomic ''If This Be Not...'' have already been noted. ''[[The Roaring Girl]]'', a city comedy that incorporates the real-life contemporary figure 'Moll Cutpurse', otherwise known as [[Mary Frith]], was a collaboration with Middleton in 1611. In the same year, he also wrote another [[tragicomedy]] called ''[[Match Me in London]]''.

During his imprisonment, Dekker did not write plays. After his release, he collaborated with Day on ''Guy of Warwick'' (1620), ''The Wonder of a Kingdom'' (1623), and ''The Bellman of Paris'' (1623). With Ford, he wrote ''[[The Sun's Darling]]'' (1624), ''[[The Fairy Knight]]'' (1624), and ''The Bristow Merchant'' (1624). He also wrote the [[tragicomedy]] ''[[The Noble Spanish Soldier]]'' (1622) and later reworked material from this play into a comedic form to produce ''The Welsh Ambassador'' (1623). Another play, ''The Late Murder of the Son upon the Mother, or [[Keep the Widow Waking]]'', a dramatization of two recent murders in Whitechapel, occasioned a suit for slander heard in the [[Star Chamber]]. That play is lost.

Dekker's plays of the 1620s were staged at the large amphitheatres on the north side of London, most commonly at the Red Bull; only two of his later plays were seen at the more exclusive, indoor [[Cockpit Theatre]], and these two were presumably produced by [[Christopher Beeston]], who operated both the Red Bull and the Cockpit. By the 1620s, the [[Shoreditch]] amphitheaters had become deeply identified with the louder and less reputable categories of play-goers, such as apprentices. Dekker's type of play appears to have suited them perfectly. Full of bold action, careless about generic differences, and always (in the end) complementary to the values and beliefs of such audiences, his drama carried some of the vigorous optimism of Elizabethan dramaturgy into the Caroline era.

===Prose===
He exhibited a similar vigour in his pamphlets, which span almost his whole writing career, and which treat a great variety of subjects and styles.

Dekker's first spate of pamphleteering began in 1603, perhaps during a period when [[bubonic plague|plague]] had closed the theaters. His first was ''[[The Wonderfull Yeare]]'', a journalistic account of the death of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]], accession of James I, and the 1603 plague, that combined a wide variety of literary genres in an attempt to convey the extraordinary events of that year ('wonderful' meaning astonishing, not excellent). It succeeded well enough to prompt two more plague pamphlets, ''News From Gravesend'' and ''The Meeting of Gallants at an Ordinary''. ''The Double PP'' (1606) is an anti-Catholic tract written in response to the [[Gunpowder Plot]]. ''[[News From Hell]]'' (1606) is an homage to and continuation of Nash's ''[[Pierce Penniless]]''. ''The Seven Deadly Sins of London'' (1606) is another plague pamphlet.

After 1608, Dekker produced his most popular pamphlets: a series of "cony-catching" pamphlets that described the various tricks and deceits of confidence-men and thieves, including [[thieves' cant]]. These pamphlets, which Dekker often updated and reissued, include ''The Belman of London'' (1608, now ''The Bellman of London''), ''Lanthorne and Candle-light'', ''Villainies Discovered by Candlelight'', and ''English Villainies''. They owe their form and many of their incidents to similar pamphlets by [[Robert Greene (16th century)|Robert Greene]].

Other pamphlets are journalistic in form and offer vivid pictures of Jacobean London. ''The Dead Term'' (1608) describes [[Westminster]] during summer vacation. ''The Guls Horne-Booke'' (1609, now ''The Gull's Hornbook'') describes the life of city gallants, including a valuable account of behaviour in the London theatres. ''Work for Armourers'' (1609) and ''The Artillery Garden'' (1616) (the latter in verse) describe aspects of England's military industries. ''London Look Back'' (1630) treats 1625, the year of James's death, while ''Wars, Wars, Wars'' (1628) describes European turmoil.

As might be expected, Dekker turned his experience in prison to profitable account. ''Dekker His Dreame'' (1620) is a long poem describing his despairing confinement; he contributed six prison-based sketches to the sixth edition (1616) of Sir [[Thomas Overbury]]'s ''Characters''; and he revised ''Lanthorne and Candlelight'' to reflect what he had learned in prison.

Dekker's pamphlets, even more than his plays, reveal signs of hasty and careless composition. Yet the best of them can still entertain, and almost all of them offer valuably precise depictions of everyday life in the Jacobean period.

Dekker's poetry entered into modern popular song (although almost unnoticeably) when some of the lyrics of the poem "Golden Slumbers", from Dekker's play ''[[Patient Grissel]]'', were included by [[Paul McCartney]] in [[the Beatles]]' 1969 song "[[Golden Slumbers]]".
