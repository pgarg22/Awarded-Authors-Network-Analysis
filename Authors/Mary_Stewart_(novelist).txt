'''Mary, Lady Stewart''' (born '''Mary Florence Elinor Rainbow'''; 17 September 1916 – 9 May 2014) was a British novelist who developed the romantic mystery genre, featuring smart, adventurous heroines who could hold their own in dangerous situations. She also wrote children's books and poetry, but may be best known for her [[Mary Stewart's Merlin Trilogy|Merlin series]], which straddles the boundary between the historical novel and fantasy.

In 1956, they moved to [[Edinburgh]], where he became professor of geology and mineralogy, and later chairman of the Geology Department at [[University of Edinburgh]].<ref name="mstew">{{cite book |title=Thornyhold |last=Stewart |first=Mary |year=1988 |type=paperback |at=Author biography}}</ref> Mary, in her own words, was a "born storyteller" and had been writing stories since the age of three. When she and her husband moved to Edinburgh, she submitted a novel to the publishers Hodder & Stoughton. ''Madam, Will You Talk?'' was an immediate success, followed by many other successful works over the years.

In 1974, Mary's husband Frederick Stewart was knighted and she became Lady Stewart, although she never used the title. Her husband died in 2001.<ref name="mstewh">{{cite web |url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/obituary/story/0,12212,750179,00.html |title=Sir Frederick Stewart |last=Pearce |first=Wright |date=19 December 2001 |work=The Guardian |access-date=28 May 2007 |archive-date=13 March 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050313234914/http://education.guardian.co.uk/obituary/story/0,12212,750179,00.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

In semi-retirement Stewart resided in Edinburgh, Scotland as well as [[Loch Awe, Scotland]]. An avid gardener, Mary and her husband shared a keen love of nature.

==Writing career==
Stewart was the best-selling author of many romantic suspense and historical fiction novels. They were well received by critics, due especially to her skillful story-telling and elegant prose. Her novels are also known for their well-crafted settings, many in England but also in such exotic locations as [[Damascus]] and the [[Greek islands]], as well as Spain, France, Austria, etc.<ref>''Contemporary Literary Criticism'', v. 35. Gale Research Company, 1985.</ref>

She was at the height of her popularity from the late 1950s to the 1980s, when many of her novels were translated into other languages. ''[[The Moon-Spinners]]'', one of her most popular novels, was also made into a [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney movie]].  Stewart was one of the most prominent writers of the romantic suspense subgenre, blending romance novels and mystery. Critically, her works are considered superior to those of other acclaimed romantic suspense novelists, such as [[Victoria Holt]] and [[Phyllis Whitney]].<ref>Friedman, Lenemaja (1990), ''Mary Stewart'', Boston, Massachusetts: Twain Publishers, {{ISBN|9780805769852}}</ref> She seamlessly combined the two genres, maintaining a full mystery while focusing on the courtship between two people,{{sfnp|Regis|2003|pages=143-144}} so that the process of solving the mystery "helps to illuminate" the hero's personality—thereby helping the heroine to fall in love with him.{{sfnp|Regis|2003|page=146}}

In the late 1960s a new generation of young readers revived a readership in [[T. H. White]]'s ''[[The Once and Future King]]'' (published in full 1958) and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (published in full 1956), and as a consequence Arthurian and heroic legends regained popularity among a critical mass of readers. Mary Stewart added to this climate by publishing ''[[The Crystal Cave]]'' (1970), the first in what was to become a four-book series later dubbed [[Mary Stewart's Merlin Trilogy|The Merlin Chronicles]]. The book placed Stewart on the best-seller list many times throughout the 1970s and 1980s.
