'''Gurū Nānak''' ([[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] pronunciation: {{IPA-pa|gʊɾuː naːnəkᵊ|}}, {{audio|Guru Nanak Dev.ogg|pronunciation|help=no}}; born as '''Nānak''' on 15 April 1469 – 22 September 1539), also referred to as '''{{Lang-pa|Bābā Nānak|label=none}}''' ('father Nānak'),{{sfn|Macauliffe|1909|p=[[s:Page:The Sikh Religion, its gurus, sacred writings and authors Vol 1.djvu/63|lvii]]}} was the founder of [[Sikhism]] and is the first of the ten [[Sikh gurus|Sikh Gurus]]. His birth is celebrated worldwide as [[Guru Nanak Gurpurab]] on ''[[Kartik Purnima|Katak Pooranmashi]]'' ('full-moon of [[Kattak]]'), i.e. October–November.

Nanak is said to have travelled far and wide across [[Asia]] teaching people the message of ''[[Ik Onkar|ik onkar]]'' ({{Lang-pa|ੴ|lit=one God|label=none}}), who dwells in every one of his creations and constitutes the eternal Truth.{{sfn|Hayer|1988|p=14}} With this concept, he would set up a unique [[Spirituality|spiritual]], social, and political platform based on equality, fraternal love, goodness, and virtue.{{sfn|Sidhu|2009|p=26}}{{sfn|Khorana|1991|p=214}}{{sfn|Prasoon|2007}}

Nanak's words are registered in the form of 974 poetic [[hymn]]s, or ''[[shabda]]'', in the holy text of Sikhism, the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], with some of the major prayers being the ''[[Japji Sahib]]'' ({{Lang-pa|jap|lit=to recite|label=none|italic=yes}}; ''ji'' and ''sahib'' are suffixes signifying respect); the ''[[Asa di Var]]'' ('ballad of hope'); and the ''[[Sidh Gosti|Sidh Gosht]]'' ('discussion with the [[Siddhas]]'). It is part of Sikh religious belief that the spirit of Nanak's {{Wikt-lang|en|sanctity|i=no}}, divinity, and religious authority had descended upon each of the nine subsequent Gurus when the Guruship was devolved on to them.

== Biography ==

=== Birth ===
[[File:The Entrance of Janam Asthan-2.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The [[Gurdwara Janam Asthan]] in [[Nankana Sahib]], [[Pakistan]], commemorates the site where Nanak is believed to have been born.]]
Nanak was born on 15 April 1469 at Rāi Bhoi Kī Talvaṇḍī village (present-day [[Nankana Sahib]], [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], [[Pakistan]]) in the [[Lahore]] province of the [[Delhi Sultanate]],{{sfn|Singh|2006|pp=12–13}}{{sfn|Grewal|1998|p=6}} although according to one tradition, he was born in the Indian month of [[Kartik (month)|Kārtik]] or November, known as [[Kattak]] in Punjabi.{{sfn|Gupta|1984|p=49}}

Most ''[[janamsakhis]]'' ({{Lang-pa|ਜਨਮਸਾਖੀ|lit=birth stories|label=none}}), or traditional biographies of Nanak, mention that he was born on the third day of the [[shukla paksha|bright lunar fortnight]], in the [[Vaisakha|Baisakh]] month (April) of [[Vikram Samvat|Samvat]] 1526.{{sfn|Gupta|1984|p=49}} These include the ''[[Janamsakhis#Editions|Puratan]]'' ('traditional' or 'ancient') ''janamsakhi'', [[Janamsakhis#The Miharban Janam-sakhi|''Miharban'' ''janamsakhi'']], ''[[Janamsakhis#Bhai Mani Singh’s Janamsakhi|Gyan-ratanavali]]'' by [[Bhai Mani Singh]], and the ''Vilayat Vali janamsakhi''.{{sfn|Gupta|1984|p=50}} The Sikh records state that Nanak died on the 10th day of the [[Ashvin|Asauj]] month of Samvat 1596 (22 September 1539&nbsp;CE), at the age of 70 years, 5 months, and 7 days. This further suggests that he was born in the month of Vaisakh (April), not Kattak (November).{{sfn|Gupta|1984|p=54}}

==== Kattak birthdate ====
In as late as 1815, during the reign of [[Ranjit Singh]], the festival commemorating Nanak's birthday was held in April at the place of his birth, known by then as [[Nankana Sahib]].{{sfn|Gupta|1984|p=50}} However, the anniversary of Nanak's birth—the [[Guru Nanak Gurpurab|Gurpurab]] (''[[guru|gur]]'' + {{Lang-pa|purab|lit=celebration|label=none|italic=yes}})—subsequently came to be celebrated on the full moon day of the Kattak month in November. The earliest record of such a celebration in Nankana Sahib is from 1868&nbsp;CE.{{sfn|Gupta|1984|p=52}}

There may be several reasons for the adoption of the Kattak birthdate by the Sikh community. For one, it may have been the date of Nanak's [[enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] or "spiritual birth" in 1496, as suggested by the ''[[Dabestan-e Mazaheb]]''.

The only janamsakhi that supports the Kattak birth tradition is [[Janamsakhis|that of Bhai Bala]]. [[Bhai Bala]] is said to have obtained Nanak's horoscope from Nanak's uncle Lalu, according to which, Nanak was born on a date corresponding to 20 October 1469&nbsp;CE. However, this janamsakhi was written by Handalis—a sect of Sikhs who followed a Sikh-convert known as Handal—attempting to depict the founder as superior to Nanak.{{sfn|Gupta|1984|pp=50–51}} According to a superstition prevailing in contemporary [[North India|northern India]], a child born in the Kattak month was believed to be weak and unlucky, hence why the work states that Nanak was born in that month.{{sfn|Gupta|1984|pp=50–51}}

[[Bhai Gurdas]], having written on a full-moon-day of the Kattak month several decades after Nanak's death, mentions that Nanak had "obtained omniscience" on the same day, and it was now the author's turn to "get divine light."{{sfn|Gupta|1984|pp=53–54}}

According to [[Max Arthur Macauliffe]] (1909), a Hindu festival held in the 19th century on [[Kartik Purnima]] in [[Amritsar]] attracted a large number of Sikhs. The Sikh community leader [[Gyani|Giani]] Sant Singh did not like this, thus starting a festival at the Sikh shrine of the [[Golden Temple]] on the same day, presenting it as the birth anniversary celebration of Guru Nanak.{{sfn|Macauliffe|1909|p=[[s:Page:The Sikh Religion, its gurus, sacred writings and authors Vol 1.djvu/90|lxxiv]]}}

Macauliffe also notes that Vaisakh (March–April) already saw a number of important festivals—such as [[Holi]], [[Rama Navami]], and [[Vaisakhi]]—therefore people would be busy in agricultural activities after the [[harvest festival]] of Baisakhi. Therefore, holding Nanak's birth anniversary celebrations immediately after Vaisakhi would have resulted in thin attendance, and therefore, smaller donations for the Sikh shrines. On the other hand, by the Kattak full moon day, the major Hindu festival of [[Diwali]] was already over, and the peasants—who had surplus cash from crop sales—were able to donate generously.{{sfn|Gupta|1984|pp=51–52}}

=== Family and early life ===
Nanak's parents, including father Kalyan Chand Das Bedi (commonly shortened to [[Mehta Kalu]]) and mother [[Mata Tripta]],{{sfn|SGPC: Guru Nanak Sahib}} were both [[Hindu Khatris]] and employed as merchants.{{sfn|Singha|2009a|p=125}}{{sfn|McLeod|2009|p=86}} His father, in particular, was the local [[Village accountant|''patwari'']] (accountant) for crop revenue in the village of [[Talwandi]].{{sfn|Nankana: Rai Bular Bhatti}}

According to Sikh traditions, the birth and early years of Nanak's life were marked with many events that demonstrated that Nanak had been blessed with divine grace.{{sfn|BBC: Religions|2011}} Commentaries on his life give details of his blossoming awareness from a young age. For instance, at the age of five, Nanak is said to have voiced interest in divine subjects. At age seven, his father enrolled him at the village school, as per custom.{{sfn|Macauliffe|2004}} Notable lore recounts that, as a child, Nanak astonished his teacher by describing the implicit symbolism of the [[aleph|first letter of the alphabet]], resembling the mathematical version of one, as denoting the unity or oneness of God.{{sfn|Cunningham|1853|pp=37–38}} Other stories of his childhood refer to strange and miraculous events about Nanak, such as the one witnessed by [[Rai Bular Bhatti|Rai Bular]], in which the sleeping child's head was shaded from the harsh sunlight by, in one account, by the stationary shadow of a tree{{citation needed|date=July 2020}} or, in another, by a venomous cobra.{{sfn|Singh|1984|p=18}} [[File:Kartarpur Guru Nanak.jpg|thumb|[[Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartar Pur]] in [[Narowal]], [[Pakistan]] marks the site where Guru Nanak is said to have died.{{sfn|Singh|2000}} ]]

[[Bebe Nanaki|Nanaki]], Nanak's only sister, was five years older than him. In 1475, she married and moved to [[Sultanpur Lodhi|Sultanpur]].{{citation needed|date=July 2020}} Jai Ram, Nanaki's husband, was employed at a ''modikhana'' (a storehouse for revenues collected in non-cash form), in the service of the [[Delhi Sultanate]]'s [[Lahore Subah|Lahore]] governor [[Daulat Khan Lodi|Daulat Khan]], at which Ram would help Nanak get a job.{{sfn|Grewal|1998|p=7}} Nanak moved to Sultanpur, and started working at the modikhana around the age of 16.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

As a young man,{{efn-lr|name=Macauliffe-marriage|Macauliffe (1909) notes that, according to the [[Janamsakhis#Bhai Mani Singh’s Janamsakhi|''janamsakhi of Mani Singh'']], Nanak was married at the age of 14, not 18. "It is related in the Janamsakhi which bears the name of Mani Singh, that Nanak was married at the age of fourteen" ([[wikisource:Page:The Sikh Religion, its gurus, sacred writings and authors Vol 1.djvu/114|p. 18]])  Subsequent janamsakhis, however, claim that Nanak was married later, after he moved to Sultanpur ([[wikisource:Page:The Sikh Religion, its gurus, sacred writings and authors Vol 1.djvu/125|p. 29]]).}}
Nanak married Sulakhani, daughter of Mūl Chand (aka Mula){{efn-lr|name=Macauliffe-marriage2|"He was betrothed to Sulakhani, daughter of Mula, a resident of Batala in the present district of Gurdaspur." (Macauliffe 1909, [[wikisource:The Sikh Religion/Volume 1/Life of Guru Nanak#19|p.19]]).}}{{efn-lr|name=Grewal-p6|"As a young man Nanak was married to Sulakhni, a daughter of Mula, a native of the newly founded town of [[Batala]] who had come there from his village, Pakho dī Randhawi, on the left bank of the river [[Ravi River|Ravi]].

and Chando Raṇi.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}
They were married on 24 September 1487, in the town of [[Batala]],{{sfn|Macauliffe|2004|p=19}} and would go on to have two sons, [[Sri Chand]] and Lakhmi Chand{{sfn|Grewal|1998|p=7}} (or Lakhmi Das).{{efn-lr|Trumpp (1877) transliterates the names of Nanak's children from the [[Janamsakhis#Editions|''Colebrooke'' ''janamsakhi'']] as "''Sirī-čand''" and "''Lakhmī-dās''", rather than "''Lakhmī-čand''" (pp. [[iarchive:in.ernet.dli.2015.69690/page/n17|iii]], [[iarchive:in.ernet.dli.2015.69690/page/n21|viii]]). Macauliffe (1909, [[wikisource:Page:The Sikh Religion, its gurus, sacred writings and authors Vol 1.djvu/125|p. 29]]) also gives their names as Sri Chand and Lakhmi Das.}}{{sfn|Trumpp|1877}} Nanak lived in Sultanpur until c. 1500,{{sfn|Grewal|1998|p=7}} which would be a formative time for him, as the ''puratan'' [[Janamsakhis|''janamsakhi'']] suggests, and in his numerous allusions to governmental structure in his hymns, most likely gained at this time.{{sfn|Cole|Sambhi|1978|p=[https://archive.org/details/sikhs00cole/age/9 9]}}

=== Final years ===
Around the age of 55, Nanak settled in [[Kartarpur, Pakistan|Kartarpur]], living there until his death in September 1539. During this period, he went on short journeys to the [[Nath]] [[yogi]] centre of Achal, and the Sufi centres of [[Pakpattan]] and [[Multan]]. By the time of his death, Nanak had acquired several followers in the [[Punjab|Punjab region]], although it is hard to estimate their number based on the extant historical evidence.{{sfn|Grewal|1998|p=8}}

Guru Nanak appointed Bhai Lehna as the successor [[Guru]], renaming him as [[Guru Angad|Guru ''Angad'']], meaning "one's very own" or "part of you". Shortly after proclaiming his successor, Guru Nanak died on 22 September 1539 in [[Kartarpur, Pakistan|Kartarpur]], at the age of 70. Guru Nanak's body was never found. When the quarreling Hindus and Muslims tugged at the sheet covering Nanak’s body, they found instead a heap of flowers — and so Nanak’s simple faith would, in course of time, flower into a religion, beset by its own contradictions and customary practices.<ref>{{cite web|title=Guru Nanak|url=http://southasia.ucla.edu/religions/gurus-saints/guru-nanak/}}</ref> [[File:SriGuruNanak'sTravels.jpg|thumb|The 4 Udasis and other locations visited by Guru Nanak]]

== Journeys (''Udasis'') ==
During first quarter of the 16th century, Nanak went on long ''udasiya'' ('journeys') for spiritual pursuits. A verse authored by him states that he visited several places in "''nau-khand''" ('the nine regions of the earth'), presumably the major Hindu and Muslim pilgrimage centres.{{sfn|Grewal|1998|p=7}}

Some modern accounts state that he visited [[Tibet]], most of [[South Asia]], and [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]], starting in 1496 at age 27, when he left his family for a thirty-year period.{{sfn|BBC: Religions|2011}}{{sfn|Dilgeer|2008}}{{sfn|Johal|2011|pp=125, note 1}} These claims include Nanak's visit to [[Mount Meru|Mount Sumeru]] of [[Hindu mythology|Indian mythology]], as well as [[Mecca]], [[Baghdad]], Achal Batala, and [[Multan]], where he would debate religious ideas with opposing groups.{{sfn|Callewaert|Snell|1994|pp=26–7}} These stories became widely popular in the 19th and 20th century, and exist in many versions.{{sfn|Lorenzen|1995}}{{sfn|Callewaert|Snell|1994|pp=26–7}}

In 1508, Nanak visited the [[Sylhet region]] in [[Bengal]].{{cn|date=January 2021}} The ''janamsakhis'' suggest that Nanak visited the [[Ram Janmabhoomi]] temple in [[Ayodhya]] in 1510–11 CE.{{sfn|Garg|2019}}

The Baghdad inscription remains the basis of writing by Indian scholars that Guru Nanak journeyed in the Middle East, with some claiming he visited [[Jerusalem]], [[Mecca]], [[Vatican City|Vatican]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Sudan]].{{sfn|Gulati|2008|pp=316–319}}

=== Disputes ===
The [[hagiography|hagiographic]] details are a subject of dispute, with modern scholarship questioning the details and authenticity of many claims. For example, Callewaert and Snell (1994) state that early Sikh texts do not contain such stories.{{sfn|Callewaert|Snell|1994|pp=26–7}} From when the travel stories first appear in hagiographic accounts of Guru Nanak, centuries after his death, they continue to become more sophisticated as time goes on, with the late phase ''Puratan'' version describing four missionary journeys, which differ from the ''Miharban'' version.{{sfn|Callewaert|Snell|1994|pp=26–7}}{{sfn|Lorenzen|1995|pp=41–2}}

Some of the stories about Guru Nanak's extensive travels first appear in the 19th-century ''Puratan'' janamsakhi, though even this version does not mention Nanak's travel to Baghdad.{{sfn|Callewaert|Snell|1994|pp=26–7}} Such embellishments and insertion of new stories, according to Callewaert and Snell (1993), closely parallel claims of miracles by [[Pir (Sufism)|Islamic ''pirs'']] found in Sufi ''[[tadhkirah (disambiguation)|tadhkirah]]s'' of the same era, giving reason to believe that these legends may have been written in a competition.{{sfn|McLeod|2007|pp=42–44}}{{sfn|Callewaert|Snell|1994|pp=26–7}}

Another source of dispute has been the Baghdad stone, bearing an inscription{{clarify|date=January 2021}} in a Turkish script. Some interpret the inscription as saying ''Baba Nanak Fakir'' was there in 1511–1512; others read it as saying 1521–1522 (and that he lived in the Middle East for 11 years away from his family). Others, particularly Western scholars, argue that the stone inscription is from the 19th century and the stone is not a reliable evidence that Guru Nanak visited Baghdad in early 16th century.{{sfn|Ménage|1979|pp=16–21}} Moreover, beyond the stone, no evidence or mention of Guru Nanak's journey in the Middle East has been found in any other Middle Eastern textual or [[Epigraphy|epigraphical]] records. Claims have been asserted of additional inscriptions, but no one has been able to locate and verify them.{{sfn|McLeod|2004|pp=127–31}}

Novel claims about his travels, as well as claims such as Guru Nanak's body vanishing after his death, are also found in later versions and these are similar to the miracle stories in Sufi literature about their ''pirs''. Other direct and indirect borrowings in the Sikh ''janamsakhis'' relating to legends around Guru Nanak's journeys are from [[Indian epic poetry|Hindu epics]] and ''[[puranas]],'' and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[Jataka tales|Jataka stories]].{{sfn|Lorenzen|1995}}{{sfn|Oberoi|1994|p=55}}{{sfn|Callewaert|Snell|1994|pp=27–30}} [[File:Bhai Mani Singh's Janamsakhi.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bhai Mani Singh]]'s ''Janamsakhi'']]

== Posthumous biographies ==
{{more citations needed section|date=April 2017}}
The earliest biographical sources on Nanak's life recognised today are the ''[[janamsakhis]]'' ('birth stories'), which recount the circumstances of the guru's birth in great detail.

''Gyan-ratanavali'' is the janamsakhi attributed to [[Bhai Mani Singh]], a disciple of [[Guru Gobind Singh]] who was approached by some Sikhs with a request that he should prepare an authentic account of Guru Nanak's life. As such, it is said that Bhai Mani Singh wrote his story with the express intention of correcting [[Heresy|heretical]] accounts of Guru Nanak.

One popular janamsakhi was allegedly written by a close companion of the Guru, [[Bhai Bala]]. However, the writing style and language employed have left scholars, such as [[Max Arthur Macauliffe]], certain that they were composed after his death.{{sfn|Macauliffe|2004}} According to such scholars, there are good reasons to doubt the claim that the author was a close companion of Guru Nanak and accompanied him on many of his travels.

[[Bhai Gurdas]], a scribe of the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], also wrote about Nanak's life in his ''vars'' ('odes'), which were compiled some time after Nanak's life, though are less detailed than the janamsakhis.

== Teachings and legacy ==
[[File:GuruNanakFresco-Goindwal.jpg|thumb|[[Fresco]] of Guru Nanak|alt=|260x260px]]
Nanak's teachings can be found in the Sikh scripture [[Guru Granth Sahib]], as a collection of verses recorded in [[Gurmukhi]].

There are two competing theories on Guru Nanak's teachings.{{sfn|Mandair|2013|pp=131–34}} The first, according to Cole and Sambhi (1995, 1997), based on the [[Hagiography|hagiographical]] ''[[Janamsakhis]]'',{{sfn|Cole|Sambhi|1995|pp=9–12}} states that Nanak's teachings and [[Sikhism]] were revelations from God, and not a social protest movement, nor an attempt to reconcile [[Hinduism]] and [[Islam]] in the 15th century.{{sfn|Cole|Sambhi|1997|p=71}}

The other theory states that Nanak was a [[Guru]], not a prophet. According to Singha (2009):{{sfn|Singha|2009a|p=104}} <blockquote>Sikhism does not subscribe to the theory of [[incarnation]] or the concept of [[prophet]] hood. But it has a pivotal concept of Guru. He is not an incarnation of God, not even a prophet. He is an illumined soul.</blockquote>
The hagiographical ''Janamsakhis'' were not written by Nanak, but by later followers without regard for historical accuracy, containing numerous legends and myths created to show respect for Nanak.{{sfn|Singh|2011|pp=2–8}} In Sikhism, the term ''revelation'', as Cole and Sambhi clarify, is not limited to the teachings of Nanak. Rather, they include all [[Sikh gurus|Sikh Gurus]], as well as the words of men and women from Nanak's past, present, and future, who possess divine knowledge intuitively through meditation. The Sikh revelations include the words of non-Sikh [[bhagat|''bhagats'']] (Hindu devotees), some who lived and died before the birth of Nanak, and whose teachings are part of the Sikh scriptures.{{sfn|Cole|Sambhi|1995|pp=46, 52–3, 95–6, 159}}

The [[Adi-Granth|Adi Granth]] and successive Sikh Gurus repeatedly emphasised, suggests Mandair (2013), that Sikhism is "not about hearing voices from God, but it is about changing the nature of the human mind, and anyone can achieve direct experience and spiritual perfection at any time."{{sfn|Mandair|2013|pp=131–34}} Guru Nanak emphasised that all human beings can have direct access to God without rituals or priests.{{sfn|BBC: Religions|2011}}

The concept of man as elaborated by Guru Nanak, states Mandair (2009), refines and negates the "[[Monotheism|monotheistic]] concept of self/God," where "monotheism becomes almost redundant in the movement and crossings of love."{{sfn|Mandair|2009|pp=372–73}} The goal of man, taught the Sikh Gurus, is to end all dualities of "self and other, I and not-I," attaining the "attendant balance of separation-fusion, self-other, action-inaction, attachment-detachment, in the course of daily life."{{sfn|Mandair|2009|pp=372–73}}

Guru Nanak, and other Sikh Gurus emphasised ''[[bhakti]]'' ('love', 'devotion', or 'worship'), and taught that the spiritual life and secular householder life are intertwined.{{sfn|Nayar|Sandhu|2007|p=106}} In the Sikh perspective, the everyday world is part of an infinite reality, where increased spiritual awareness leads to increased and vibrant participation in the everyday world.{{sfn|Kaur|2004|p=530}} Guru Nanak described living an "active, creative, and practical life" of "truthfulness, fidelity, self-control and purity" as being higher than the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] truth.{{sfn|Marwha|2006|p=205}}

Through popular tradition, Nanak's teaching is understood to be practised in three ways:{{sfn|McLeod|2009|pp=139–40}}

* ''[[Vand Chhako|Vand Shhako]]'' ({{Lang-pa|ਵੰਡ ਛਕੋ|lit=share & consume|label=none}}): Share with others, help those who are in need, so you may eat together;
* ''[[Kirat Karo]]'' ('work honestly'): Earn an honest living, without exploitation or fraud; and
* ''[[Naam Japo]]'' ({{Lang-pa|ਨਾਮ ਜਪੋ|lit=recite His name|label=none}}): Meditate on God's name, so to feel His presence and control the [[Five Thieves|five thieves]] of the human personality.

=== Legacy ===
Nanak is considered the founder of [[Sikhism]].{{sfn|Cole|Sambhi|1978|pp=[https://archive.org/details/sikhs00cole/age/9 9–10]}}{{sfn|Moreno|Colino|2010|p=207}} The fundamental beliefs of Sikhism, articulated in the sacred scripture [[Guru Granth Sahib]], include faith and meditation on the name of the one creator; unity of all humankind; engaging in [[selfless service]], striving for social justice for the [[Sarbat da bhala|benefit and prosperity of all]]; and honest conduct and livelihood while living a householder's life.{{sfn|Kalsi|2007|pp=41–50}}{{sfn|Cole|Sambhi|1995|p=200}}{{sfn|Teece|2004|p=4}}

The Guru Granth Sahib is worshipped as the supreme authority of Sikhism and is considered the final and perpetual guru of Sikhism. As the first guru of Sikhism, Guru Nanak contributed a total of 974 hymns to the book.{{sfn|Shackle|Mandair|2013|pp=xviii–xix}}

== Influences ==
Many Sikhs believe that Guru Nanak's message was divinely revealed, as his own words in [[Guru Granth Sahib]] state that his teachings are as he has received them from the Creator Himself. The critical event of his life in [[Sultanpur Lodhi|Sultanpur]], in which he returned after three days with enlightenment, also supports this belief.{{sfn|Singh|1982|pp=12, 18}}{{failed verification|date=July 2020}}<ref>{{cite news |title=There is One God |url=https://www.thehansindia.com/posts/index/spiritual/2018-09-01/there-is-one-god/409124 |agency=The Hans India}}</ref>

Many modern historians give weight to his teachings' linkage with the pre-existing ''[[bhakti]]'',{{sfn|Lorenzen|1995|pp=1–2}} [[Sant (religion)|''sant'']],{{efn-lr|"In its earliest stage Sikhism was clearly a movement within the Hindu tradition; Nanak was raised a Hindu and eventually belonged to the Sant tradition of northern India." {{harv|McLeod|2019}}}} and ''[[wali]]'' of South Asian/Islamic tradition.{{sfn|Fenech|2014}} Scholars state that in its origins, Guru Nanak and Sikhism were influenced by the ''nirguni'' ('formless God') tradition of the [[Bhakti movement]] in medieval India.{{efn-lr|name=David Lorenzen 1995 pages 1–2|"Historically, Sikh religion derives from this [[Bhajan|nirguni]] current of bhakti religion." {{harv|Lorenzen|1995|pp=1–2}}}} However, some historians do not see evidence of Sikhism as simply an extension of the [[Bhakti movement]].{{sfn|Singha|2009b|p=8}}{{sfn|Grewal|1998|pp=28–}} Sikhism, for instance, disagreed with some views of Bhakti saints [[Kabir]] and [[Ravidas]].{{sfn|Singha|2009b|p=8}}{{sfn|Pruthi|2004|pp=202–03}}

The roots of the Sikh tradition are perhaps in the [[Sant (religion)|sant]]-tradition of India whose ideology grew to become the Bhakti tradition.{{efn-lr|name=Louis Fenech 2014 page 35|"Technically this would place the Sikh community's origins at a much further remove than 1469, perhaps to the dawning of the Sant movement, which possesses clear affinities to Guru Nanak's thought sometime in the tenth century. The predominant ideology of the Sant ''[[Guru–shishya tradition|parampara]]'' in turn corresponds in many respects to the much wider devotional Bhakti tradition in northern India." {{harv|Fenech|2014|p=35}}}} Fenech (2014) suggests that:{{sfn|Fenech|2014}} <blockquote>Indic mythology permeates the Sikh sacred canon, the ''Guru Granth Sahib'' and the secondary canon, the ''[[Dasam Granth]]'' and adds delicate nuance and substance to the sacred symbolic universe of the Sikhs of today and of their past ancestors.{{efn-lr|"Few Sikhs would mention these Indic texts and ideologies in the same breadth as the Sikh tradition, let alone trace elements of their tradition to this chronological and ideological point, '''despite the fact''' that the Indic mythology permeates the Sikh sacred canon, the ''Guru Granth Sahib'' and the secondary canon, the ''Dasam Granth'',<ref>Rinehart 2011</ref> and adds delicate nuance and substance to the sacred symbolic universe of the Sikhs of today and of their past ancestors." {{harv|Fenech|2014|p=36}}}}
</blockquote>

==In the Bahá'í Faith==
{{See also|Baháʼí Faith in India}}
In a letter, dated 27 October 1985, to the [[Spiritual Assembly|National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of India]], the [[Universal House of Justice]] stated that Guru Nanak was endowed with a "saintly character" and that he was:{{sfn|Sarwal|1996}} <blockquote>…inspired to reconcile the religions of Hinduism and Islám, the followers of which religions had been in violent conflict.… The Bahá'ís thus view Guru Nanak as a 'saint of the highest order'.</blockquote>
