'''Robert Lynn Asprin''' (June 28, 1946 – May 22, 2008)<ref><!-- [http://www.mythadventures.net Asprin's homepage] --> [http://mythadventures.net/robert-asprin-memorial-page/ Memorial page]</ref> was an American science fiction and [[fantasy authors|fantasy author]] and [[science fiction fandom|active fan]], known best for his humorous series ''[[MythAdventures]]'' and ''[[Phule's Company (series)|Phule's Company]]''.

== Background ==
Robert Asprin was born in [[St. Johns, Michigan]], and attended the [[University of Michigan]] at [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] from 1964 through 1965. From 1965 through 1966 he served in the [[United States Army]]. He was married, twice, and had two children. He was active in [[science fiction fandom]] and in the early years of the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]] using the name "Yang the Nauseating", and co-initiated the society [[Great Dark Horde]] during 1971. He was also the initiator and an influential member of the [[Dorsai Irregulars]].<ref>[http://www.di.org/di_top.htm Dorsai Irregulars website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121062748/http://di.org/di_top.htm |date=January 21, 2012 }}</ref> In 1976, he was nominated for the [[Hugo Award]] for [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation|Best Dramatic Presentation]] for ''[[The Capture (cartoon)|The Capture]]'', a [[cartoon]] [[slide show]] written by Asprin and drawn by [[Phil Foglio]].<ref>{{cite web

== Early writing ==
Asprin's first novel, ''[[The Cold Cash War]]'', an expansion of an earlier short story of the same title, was published in 1977.

During the next few years, he created and edited (with his then-wife, [[Lynn Abbey]]) the ''[[Thieves' World]]''<ref>[[Thieves' World]]</ref> series of [[shared universe|shared world]] anthologies, credited as the first project of its type. Many of the authors later produced novels and stories of the theme which were not included in the anthologies, beginning with ''Beyond Sanctuary'' by [[Janet Morris]], the first "authorized" Thieves World novel, published in 1985. Janet Morris and [[Chris Morris (author)|Chris Morris]] later produced two more authorized Thieves' World novels and a series of related novels about their character Tempus and [[the Sacred Band of Stepsons]].<ref>[[The Sacred Band of Stepsons]] saga, [[Janet Morris]] and [[Chris Morris (author)|Chris Morris]] (1985–2010)</ref> A series of [[graphic novel]]s followed during the mid-1980s, and several other authors, including [[Andrew J. Offutt]] and [[David Drake]], published novels about their characters. In 2002, Lynn Abbey revived the series with the novel ''Sanctuary''.

During 1978, Asprin began the "[[MythAdventures]]" series, chronicling the comic adventures of Skeeve and Aahz, with the book ''[[Another Fine Myth]]''. Illustrated originally by [[Frank Kelly Freas]], and later by [[Phil Foglio]], the [[pun]]-rich books concern a "demon" magician who has lost his powers and his inexperienced human apprentice as they travel through a variety of worlds. Some of the early "Myth" novels were adapted later as comic books by [[Phil Foglio|Foglio]] and others. The Myth books have been published by three publishing companies over the years:  [[The Donning Company|Donning Starblaze]], [[Meisha Merlin]] and, as of 2008, [[Wildside Press]].

During the 1990s, Asprin's "Phule" novels concerned the humorous science-fiction exploits of a rag-tag "Space Legion" and its wealthy and iconoclastic commander, Willard Phule.

== Hiatus in writing career ==
Due to a series of personal and financial problems, Asprin published little during the 1990s, although he had two books on [[The New York Times Best Seller list]], which piqued the interest of fans and the [[Internal Revenue Service]]. He eventually negotiated an agreement with the IRS<ref>[http://www.crescentblues.com/4_5issue/int_asprin_delcarlo2.shtml "Robert Asprin and Eric Del Carlo: ''No Quarter''"], Crescent Blues, Volume 4, Issue 5 (August 2002).</ref> that encouraged him to resume writing, and, during the early 2000s he published several novels, mostly in collaboration with authors [[Peter Heck]], [[Jody Lynn Nye]], and [[Linda Evans (author)|Linda Evans]]. These novels included continuations of the series "Myth Adventures" and  "Phule's Company" as well as works of new series.

== Later work ==
One of Asprin's last projects was ''NO Quarter'', originally co-authored with Eric Del Carlo, and later edited by Teresa Patterson. It is a dark fantasy/suspense/ murder mystery novel set in the author's beloved New Orleans French Quarter. Although the novel's fantasy elements (voodoo and black magic, tarot readings and precognition, ghosts and mysticism) are secondary to the brutal murder that is the emphasis of the plot, it is set in the same milieu as Asprin's Griffen McCandles novels (''Dragons'' series), ''Dragons Luck'' and ''Dragons Wild''. The two protagonists of ''NO Quarter'', Maestro and Bone, also appear as minor characters of the ''Dragons'' novels. Maestro, the mysterious professional pool player and fencing master in ''NO Quarter'', is a fictionalized but based recognizably on the author. ''NO Quarter'' was published November 2009 by DarkStar Books.

Asprin's ofttimes co-author, [[Jody Lynn Nye]], has completed one further Griffen McCandles novel, ''Dragons Deal'', and continued the ''Myth Adventures'' series.  ''Dragons Deal'' was published by Ace in December 2010.

== Death and aftermath ==
Asprin died on May 22, 2008, of heart failure at his home in New Orleans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.transworldnews.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=47897&cat=14 |title=Trans World News Notice of Death |access-date=2008-05-24 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719040043/http://www.transworldnews.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=47897&cat=14 |archive-date=July 19, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://sfscope.com/2008/05/author-robert-asprin-dies.html |title=SFScope Notice of Death from Natural Causes |access-date=2008-05-24 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721192218/http://sfscope.com/2008/05/author-robert-asprin-dies.html |archive-date=July 21, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> He was found lying on a sofa with a [[Terry Pratchett]] novel still open in his hands.<ref>[http://lynnabbey.com/FaceOfChaos/friendship-never-forgotten/ Friendship never forgotten]; by [[Lynn Abbey]]; published May 23, 2008; retrieved June 25, 2018</ref> He was to have been the Guest of Honor at [[Marcon (convention)|Marcon]] that weekend.<ref>Jody Lynn Nye, "Afterward", Myth-Fortunes.
