Born in Prowent (now part of [[Kórnik]]), she resided in [[Kraków]] until the end of her life.<ref name=reuters_death/><ref name=france24_death/> In Poland, Szymborska's books have reached sales rivaling prominent prose authors', though she wrote in a poem, "Some Like Poetry" ("Niektórzy lubią poezję"), that "perhaps" two in a thousand people like poetry.<ref>Szymborska, Wisława. [http://www.poetseers.org/nobel_prize_for_literature/wislawa_szymborska/library/some_like_poetry "Some Like Poetry"].</ref>

Szymborska was awarded the 1996 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] "for poetry that with ironic precision allows the historical and biological context to come to light in fragments of human reality".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1996|publisher=Nobelprize|date=7 October 2010|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1996|access-date=7 October 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title=I Don't Know: The Nobel lecture|magazine=The New Republic|date=30 December 1996|url=http://www.tnr.com/article/books-and-arts/100368/i-dont-know|access-date=19 February 2012}}</ref> She became better known internationally as a result. Her work has been translated into English and many [[European languages]], as well as into Arabic, [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], Japanese, [[Persian language|Persian]] and Chinese.

== Life ==
[[File:Dawna oficyna folwarczna z ok. poł. XVIII w., ul. Prowent 4.jpg|thumb|right|260px|The house where Wisława Szymborska was born, in Prowent, now part of [[Kórnik]], Poland]]
Wisława Szymborska was born on 2 July 1923 in [[Prowent]], Poland (now part of [[Kórnik]], Poland), the second daughter<ref>{{cite web|url=http://culture.pl/pl/tworca/wislawa-szymborska |title=Wisława Szymborska |last=Kowalczyk |first=Janusz R. |date=2012 |publisher= culture.pl |access-date=18 September 2017}}</ref> of Wincenty Szymborski and Anna (née Rottermund) Szymborska. Her father was, at that time, the [[steward (office)|steward]] of Count [[Władysław Zamoyski]], a Polish patriot and charitable [[patronage|patron]]. After Zamoyski's death in 1924, her family moved to [[Toruń]], and in 1931 to [[Kraków]], where she lived and worked until her death in early 2012.<ref name=france24_death/>

When [[World War II]] broke out in 1939, she continued her education in [[Education in Poland during World War II|underground classes]]. From 1943, she worked as a railroad employee and managed to avoid being deported to Germany as a [[forced labor in Nazi Germany|forced labour]]er.<ref name=france24_death/> During this time, her career as an artist began, with illustrations for an English-language textbook. She also began writing stories and [[occasional poems]]. In 1945, she began studying Polish literature before switching to sociology at [[Jagiellonian University]] in Kraków.<ref name=france24_death/> There, she became involved in the local writing scene, and met and was influenced by [[Czesław Miłosz]]. In March 1945, she published her first poem, "Szukam słowa" ("Looking for words"), in the daily newspaper ''Dziennik Polski''. Her poems continued to be published in various newspapers and periodicals for a number of years.<ref name=france24_death/><ref name=bbc_death/> In 1948, she quit her studies without a degree, due to poor financial circumstances; the same year, she married poet [[Adam Włodek]], whom she divorced in 1954. They remained close until Włodek's death in 1986.<ref name=france24_death/> Their union was childless. Around the time of her marriage, she was working as a secretary for an educational biweekly magazine as well as an illustrator. Her first book was to be published in 1949, but did not pass censorship as it "did not meet socialist requirements".

Szymborska adhered to the [[People's Republic of Poland]]'s (PRL) official ideology early in her career, signing an infamous 1953 political petition condemning [[Stalinist show trial of the Kraków Curia|Polish priests accused of treason in a show trial]].<ref name="Zieleśkiewicz">Michał St. de Zieleśkiewicz, [http://www.bibula.com/?p=30966 "Szymborska: zabić księży Kurii Krakowskiej."] ''Bibula – pismo niezalezne'', 21 January 2011. {{in lang|pl}}</ref><ref name="Łysiak2000">{{cite book|author=Waldemar Łysiak|title=Stulecie kłamców|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bXIWAQAAIAAJ|access-date=3 February 2012|year=2000|publisher=Ex Libris/Galeria Polskiej Książki|isbn=978-83-88455-21-6|page=214}}</ref><ref name="Wilhelm">{{cite book|author=Stanisław Wilhelm|title=Pajęczyna III RP – Urzędnicy i Sędziowie; Anatomia manipulacji prawem|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lQkZgdcdwGMC&pg=PA320|access-date=3 February 2012|publisher=Stanislaw Wilhelm Grys|isbn=978-83-932740-0-0|page=320}}</ref> Her early work supported socialist themes, as seen in her debut collection ''Dlatego żyjemy'' (''That is what we are living for''), containing the poems "Lenin" and "Młodzieży budującej Nową Hutę" ("For the Youth who are building [[Nowa Huta]]"), about the construction of a Stalinist industrial town near Kraków.<ref name=france24_death/> She became a member of the ruling [[Polish United Workers' Party]].

Although initially close to the official party line, as the Polish Communist Party shifted from the Stalinist communists to "national" communists, Szymborska grew estranged from socialist ideology and renounced her earlier political work.<ref name=france24_death/> Although she did not officially leave the Communist party until 1966, she began to establish contacts with dissidents.<ref name=france24_death/> As early as 1957, she befriended [[Jerzy Giedroyc]], the editor of the influential Paris-based émigré journal ''[[Kultura]]'', to which she contributed. In 1964, she opposed a Communist-backed protest to ''[[The Times]]'' against independent intellectuals, demanding freedom of speech instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prawy.pl/r2_index.php?dz=felietony&id=27894&subdz=11|title=portal poświęcony Polsce, rodzinie i tradycji|publisher=Prawy.pl|access-date=3 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218221203/http://prawy.pl/r2_index.php?dz=felietony&id=27894&subdz=11|archive-date=18 February 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1953, Szymborska joined the staff of the literary review magazine ''Życie Literackie'' (''Literary Life''), where she continued to work until 1981 and from 1968 had a book review column, ''Lektury Nadobowiązkowe''.<ref name=france24_death/> Many of her essays from this period were later published in book form. From 1981 to 1983, she was an editor of the Kraków-based monthly periodical ''NaGlos'' (''OutLoud''). In the 1980s, she intensified her oppositional activities, contributing to the [[samizdat]] periodical ''Arka'' under the pseudonym "Stańczykówna", as well as to ''Kultura''. In the early 1990s, with a poem published in ''[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]'', she supported the vote of no confidence in the first non-Communist government that brought former Communists back to power. The last collection published while Szymborska was still alive, ''Dwukropek'', was chosen as the best book of 2006 by readers of Poland's ''[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]''.<ref name=france24_death/> She also translated [[French literature]] into Polish, in particular [[Baroque]] poetry and the works of [[Agrippa d'Aubigné]], a [[Huguenot]] soldier-poet during the [[French Wars of Religion]]. In Germany, Szymborska is closely associated with her translator [[Karl Dedecius]], who did much to popularize her works there.

==Death and last works==
Surrounded by friends and relatives, Szymborska died peacefully of lung cancer in her sleep at home in Kraków in 2012, aged 88.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/02/books/wislawa-szymborska-nobel-winning-polish-poet-dies-at-88.html|title=Wislawa Szymborska, Nobel-Winning Polish Poet, Dies at 88|first=Raymond H.|last=Anderson|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1 February 2012|access-date=25 July 2020}}</ref><ref name=reuters_death>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-poland-szymborska-idUSTRE8102OO20120201|title=Polish Nobel winning poet Szymborska dies at 88|work=Reuters|date=1 February 2012|access-date=1 February 2012}}</ref><ref name=france24_death>{{cite news|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20120201-nobel-prize-polish-poet-wislawa-szymborska-dead|title=Nobel Prize-winning poet Szymborska dies aged 88|work=France24|date=1 February 2012|access-date=1 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rmf24.pl/kultura/news-nie-zyje-wislawa-szymborska,nId,432138|title=Dates of birth and death for Wisława Szymborska|publisher=Rmf24.pl|access-date=3 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiadomosci.onet.pl/kraj/wislawa-szymborska-nie-zyje-miala-89-lat,1,5013753,wiadomosc.html |title=Notice of Wisława Szymborska's death|date=February 2012|publisher=Wiadomosci.onet.pl|access-date=3 February 2012}}</ref> She was working on new poetry at the time of her death, but was unable to arrange her final poems for publication in the way she wanted.

==Themes==
Szymborska frequently employed literary devices such as ironic precision, [[paradox (literature)|paradox]], contradiction, and understatement to illuminate philosophical themes and obsessions. Many of her poems feature war and terrorism.<ref name=reuters_death/><ref name=france24_death/><ref>{{cite news|first=Alex|last=Duval Smith|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article319509.ece|title=A Nobel Calling: 100 Years of Controversy|work=The Independent|location=UK|publisher=Independent Print Limited|date=14 October 2005|access-date=26 April 2008|quote=1996: Her poem, "The End and the Beginning", reads: "No sound bites, no photo opportunities And it takes years All the cameras have gone To other wars."

She wrote from unusual points of view, such as a cat in the newly empty apartment of its dead owner.<ref name=france24_death/> Her reputation rests on a relatively small body of work, fewer than 350 poems. When asked why she had published so few poems, she said, "I have a trash can in my home".<ref name=reuters_death/>

==Pop culture==
Szymborska's poem "Nothing Twice" was set to music by Andrzej Munkowski and performed by Łucja Prus in 1965. Rock singer Kora's cover of "Nothing Twice" was a hit in 1994.

Szymborska's poem "Buffo" was set to music by [[Barbara Maria Zakrzewska-Nikiporczyk]] in 1985.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Barbara Zakrzewska|url=https://polishmusic.usc.edu/research/composers/barbara-zakrzewska/|access-date=2021-08-22|website=Polish Music Center|language=en-US}}</ref>

The poem "Love at First Sight" was used in the film ''[[Turn Left, Turn Right]]'', starring [[Takeshi Kaneshiro]] and [[Gigi Leung]]. [[Krzysztof Kieślowski]]'s film ''[[Three Colors: Red]]'' was also inspired by "Love at First Sight".

In her last year, Szymborska collaborated with Polish jazz trumpeter [[Tomasz Stańko]], who dedicated his record ''Wisława'' ([[ECM Records|ECM]], 2013) to her memory, taking inspiration from their collaboration and her poetry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ecmrecords.com/Catalogue/ECM/2300/2304_05.php|title=ECM 2304_05|access-date=12 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209221442/http://www.ecmrecords.com/Catalogue/ECM/2300/2304_05.php|archive-date=9 February 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Szymborska's poem "People on the Bridge" was made into a film by [[Beata Pozniak]]. It was shown worldwide and at a New Delhi film festival. As an award, it was screened 36 more times in 18 Indian cities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://beata.com/newpage/filmography/2014-peopleonthebridge/history.mht/index.htm|title= People on the Bridge HOLLYWOOD (Hollywood Today)}}</ref>
