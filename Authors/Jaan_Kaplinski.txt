He translated writings from [[French language|French]], [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], including the [[Tao Te Ching]], and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], the work of [[Tomas Tranströmer]].

Kaplinski's own work has been translated into English, [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[French language|French]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], and [[Czech language|Czech]].

Jaan Kaplinski was one of the authors and initiators of the so-called ''[[Letter of 40 intellectuals]]'' (''Neljakümne kiri'') action. A letter signed by well-known Estonian intellectuals protesting against the behavior of the authorities in [[Estonian SSR|Soviet-annexed Estonia]] was sent to the main newspapers of the time. Although not openly dissident, the letter was never published in the press at that time and those who signed were repressed using administrative measures.

In 1997, he was awarded the [[Baltic Assembly Prize for Literature, the Arts and Science]].
