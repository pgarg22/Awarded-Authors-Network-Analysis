'''Pingali Suranna''' (16th century [[Common Era|CE]]) was a [[Telugu language|Telugu]] [[poet]] and was one of the ''[[Astadiggajas]]''.

==Early life==
Suranna's exact birthplace is uncertain. He lived in Kanala village near [[Nandyala]]. <ref>[http://www.census2011.co.in/data/village/594314-kanala-andhra-pradesh.html]</ref><ref>[http://wikiedit.org/India/Kanala/207274/]</ref>

Suranna's parents were Abbamamba (mother) and Amarana (father), scholars themselves.  Surana dedicated a work to [[Nandyala Krishna Raju]], a [[Samanta Raju|subject]] of the [[Vijayanagara Empire]] in [[Krishna District]]. It is now settled that he was from Kanala village, near Nandyala, on Nandyala and Koilakuntla Road of [[Kurnool District]]. There is his samadhi. Potter community celebrates his Jayanthi year after year. There is an old Oriental High School in Kanala, which is said to be the legacy from Pingali Surana. Surana Saraswatha Sangham, Nandyal is a literary organisation in existence for more than 25 years. Dr. G. Sahadevudu, a practicing doctor, Gottimukkala Subrahmanya Sastri, a retired teacher and Koduri Seshapani Sarma, a retired teacher are the President, the Secretary and the Joint Secretary of the organization respectively.

==Literary works==
Surana wrote ''Garuda Puranam'', ''Prabhavatee Pradyumnamu'', ''Raghava Pandaveeyam'' and ''Kalapurnodayamu'' in 1500 [[Common Era|CE]]. He dedicated ''Garuda Puranam'' to his father and ''Kalapurnodayam'' to the Nandyal King.

''Prabhavati Pradyumnamu'' and ''Kalapurnodayamu'' have been translated into English by [[Velcheru Narayana Rao]] and [[David Dean Shulman|David Shulman]]. ''The Sound of the Kiss, or The Story that Must Never be Told,'' translation of ''Kalapurnodayamu,'' was published by Columbia University Press in 2002.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-sound-of-the-kiss-or-the-story-that-must-never-be-told/9780231125970|title=The Sound of the Kiss, or The Story That Must Never Be Told {{!}} Columbia University Press|work=Columbia University Press|access-date=2018-10-04|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2324572.The_Sound_of_the_Kiss_or_the_Story_That_Must_Never_Be_Told|title=The Sound of the Kiss, or the Story That Must Never Be Told|website=www.goodreads.com|access-date=2018-10-04}}</ref> ''The Demon's Daughter: A Love Story from South India,'' translation of ''Prabhavati Pradyumnamu,'' was published by [[SUNY Press]] in 2006.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sunypress.edu/p-4227-the-demons-daughter.aspx|title=The Demon's Daughter|website=www.sunypress.edu|access-date=2018-10-04}}</ref><ref>[http://www.complete-review.com/reviews/telugu/surannap.htm Review] at [[complete review]] website</ref>'' 

===Style===
Two of his works were revolutionary in Telugu and the first of their kind. ''Kalapurnodayam'' is more of a novel than poetry and ''Raghava Pandaveeyam'' is in ''dvayarthi'' ([[double meaning]]) style.

''Kalapurnodayamu'' means full bloom of art. Surana used advanced literary techniques in Indian literature such as flashbacks and character transformation.
Each poem of ''Raghava Pandaveeyam'' references to the stories of [[Ramayanam]] or [[Mahabharatam]] simultaneously. The entire work is double entendre. His first work ''Garuda Puranam'' is in Prabandha style, popular for romantic poems.

==Awards and Titles==
* The critic [[Cattamanchi Ramalinga Reddy]] praised ''Kalapurnodayam'' as the best original book ever written in Telugu.
