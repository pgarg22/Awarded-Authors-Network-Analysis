'''George Ade''' (February 9, 1866 – May 16, 1944) was an American writer, syndicated newspaper columnist, and playwright who gained national notoriety at the turn of the 20th century with his "Stories of the Streets and of the Town", a column that used street language and slang to describe daily life in [[Chicago]], and a column of his fables in slang, which were humorous stories that featured vernacular speech and the liberal use of capitalization in his characters' dialog. 

Ade's fables in slang gained him wealth and fame as an American humorist, as well as earning him the nickname of the "Aesop of Indiana". His notable early books include ''Artie'' (1896); ''Pink Marsh'' (1897); ''Fables in Slang'' (1900), the first in a series of books; and ''In Babel'' (1903), a collection of his short stories. His first play produced for the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] stage was ''The Sultan of Sulu'', written in 1901. ''The Sho-Gun'' and his best-known plays, ''[[The County Chairman (play)|The County Chairman]]'' and ''[[The College Widow (play)|The College Widow]]'', were simultaneously appearing on Broadway in 1904. Ade also wrote scripts and had some of his fables and plays adapted into motion pictures.

During the first quarter of the 20th century, Ade, along with [[Booth Tarkington]], [[Meredith Nicholson]], and [[James Whitcomb Riley]] helped to create a [[Golden Age of Indiana Literature|Golden Age of literature in Indiana]].

The [[Purdue University]] graduate from rural [[Newton County, Indiana]], began his career in journalism as a newspaper reporter in [[Lafayette, Indiana]], before moving to Chicago, Illinois, to work for the ''[[Chicago Daily News]]''. In addition to writing, Ade enjoyed traveling, golf, and entertaining at [[George Ade House|Hazelden]], his estate home near [[Brook, Indiana]]. Ade was also a member of Purdue University's board of trustees from 1909 to 1916, a longtime member of the Purdue Alumni Association, a supporter of [[Sigma Chi]] (his college fraternity), and a former president of the Mark Twain Association of America. In addition, he donated funds for construction of Purdue's Memorial Gymnasium, its Memorial Union Building, and with [[David Edward Ross]], contributed land and funding for construction of Purdue's [[Ross–Ade Stadium]], named in their honor in 1924.

==Early life and education==
George Ade was born in [[Kentland, Indiana]], on February 9, 1866, to John and Adaline (Bush) Ade.<ref name="BDA1906">{{harvnb|Johnson|1906|p=58}}</ref> George was the second youngest of the family's seven children (four boys and three girls). George's father served as the [[Newton County, Indiana]], recorder, and was also a banker in Kentland; his mother was a homemaker. George enjoyed reading from an early age, but he disliked manual labor and was not interested in becoming a farmer. Although he graduated from Kentland High School in 1881, his mother did not think he was ready for college. As a result, Ade remained in high school for another year before enrolling at [[Purdue University]] in 1883 on scholarship.<ref name="LeonardMarquis1908">{{cite book | editor1-first = John William | editor1-last  = Leonard | editor2-first = Albert Nelson | editor2-last  = Marquis | title= Who's who in America | publisher = Marquis Who's Who, Incorporated | volume= 5 | page= 13 | year= 1908 | location  = Chicago | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=eX0QOpl7iBQC&pg=PA13}}</ref><ref name=Boomhower60>{{cite book | author=Boomhower, Ray E. | title =Destination Indiana: Travels Through Hoosier History | publisher =Indiana Historical Society | year =2000 | location =Indianapolis | page=60  | isbn =0871951479}}</ref><ref name=PurdueLib-Bio>"Biographical Sketch" in {{cite book | author=Mendes, Joanne, compiler | title =A Guild to the George Ade Papers | publisher =Purdue University Libraries, Archives and Special Collections | year =2007 | location =West Lafayette, Indiana | pages =7–10 | url =https://archives.lib.purdue.edu/fa/ade.pdf  }}</ref>   

Ade studied science at Purdue, but his grades began to falter after his first year when he became more active in the college's social life. Ade also developed an interest in the theater and became a regular at the Grand Opera House in [[Lafayette, Indiana]]. In addition, he joined the [[Sigma Chi]] fraternity. Ade also met and began a lifelong friendship with [[cartoonist]] and [[Sigma Chi]] fraternity brother [[John T. McCutcheon]]. Ade graduated with a bachelor of science degree from Purdue in 1887. He briefly thought about becoming a lawyer, but abandoned the idea to pursue a career in journalism.<ref name="LeonardMarquis1908"/><ref name=Authors-Ade>{{cite book | author=Banta, R.

==Career==
[[File:George Ade and John McCutcheon.jpg|thumb|left|Ade (left), with [[John T. McCutcheon]], circa 1894–1895]]
===Newspaper reporter=== 
Ade did not begin his writing career in college. In 1887, after graduating from Purdue University, he worked in Lafayette, Indiana, as a reporter and telegraph editor for the ''Lafayette Morning News'' and then the ''Lafayette Call''.<ref name="BDA1906" /> After the newspaper discontinued publication, Ade earned a meager paycheck writing testimonials for a patent-medicine company. By 1890 he had moved to Chicago, Illinois, and resumed his career as a newspaper reporter, joining John T. McCutcheon, his college friend and Sigma Chi fraternity brother, at the ''Chicago Daily News'' (which later became the ''Chicago Morning News'' and the ''Chicago Record''), where McCutcheon worked as an illustrator.<ref name="LeonardMarquis1908"/><ref name=Matson9/> 

Ade's first assignment was writing a daily weather story for the ''Morning News''. He also covered some major news events, including the explosion of the steamer ''Tioga'' on the [[Chicago River]]; the [[heavyweight]] championship [[boxing]] match between [[John L. Sullivan]] and [[James J. Corbett]] in [[New Orleans]], Louisiana, in 1892; and the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] (Chicago World's Fair) in 1893.<ref name=GS3-4/>

===Syndicated columnist===
While working for the ''Chicago Record'', Ade developed his talent for turning local human-interest stories into humorous satire, which became his trademark.<ref name=Newberry>{{cite web| title =Inventory of the George Ade Papers, 1865–1971: Biography of George Ade | publisher =The Newberry | url =https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/Ade.xml | access-date =June 6, 2019}}</ref> Beginning in 1893, Ade was put in charge of the daily column, "Stories of the Streets and of the Town," which frequently included McCutcheon's illustrations. Through Ade's use of street language and slang, the column described daily life in Chicago and introduced some of his early literary characters, which included Artie, an office boy; Doc Horne, a "gentlemanly liar"; and Pink Marsh, an African American shoeshine boy who worked in a barbershop.<ref name=GS3-4/><ref>Matson, p. 12.</ref> Collections of Ade's columns were subsequently published as books, such as ''Artie'' (1896), ''Pink Marsh'' (1897), and ''Doc' Horne'' (1899), which also helped to increase the popularity of his column. Ade's newspaper columns also included dialog and short plays containing his humorous observations of everyday life.<ref name=Newberry/>  

Ade first introduced his fables in slang in the ''Chicago Record'' in 1897. "The Fable of Sister Mae, Who Did As Well As Could Be Expected" appeared on September 17, 1897; the second one, "A Fable in Slang," appeared a year later; others followed in a weekly column. These humorous stories, complete with morals, featured vernacular speech and Ade's idiosyncratic capitalization of the characters' dialog. Ade left the ''Chicago Record'' in 1899 to work on nationallysyndicated newspaper column of his fables in slang. ''Fables in Slang'' (1900), the first in a series of book of Ade's fables, was popular with the public and for nearly twenty years more collections of his fables were compiled into additional books, ending with ''Hand-Made Fables'' (1920). Ade's fables also appeared in periodicals, the [[Essanay Studios|Essanay Film Manufacturing Company]] produced them as motion-picture shorts, and Art Helfant also turned them into [[comic strip]]s.<ref name=GS3-4/><ref name=Newberry/><ref>Matson, p. 14.</ref>

===Playwright and author===
[[File:College Widow Play 1904 Truesdell Tennant.png|thumb|right|Frederick Truesdell and [[Dorothy Tennant (actress)|Dorothy Tennant]] in a scene from ''[[The College Widow (play)|The College Widow]]'']]

After Ade's newspaper columns went into syndication in 1900, he began writing plays. His first play produced for the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] stage was ''The Sultan of Sulu'', a comic opera about the American military's efforts to assimilate natives of the [[Philippines]] into American culture. Written in 1901 with composer [[Nathaniel D. Mann]] and lyricist [[Alfred George Whathall]], it was produced on Broadway in 1902. His other works for Broadway include ''Peggy from Paris'' (1903), a musical comedy; ''[[The County Chairman (play)|The County Chairman]]'' (1903), a piece about small-town politics; ''The Sho-Gun'' (1904), a musical set in Korea; and ''[[The College Widow (play)|The College Widow]]'' (1904), a comedy about college life and American [[college football|collegiate football]].<ref name=PurdueLib-Bio/><ref name=Maston18-22>Matson, pp. 18 and 22.</ref><ref name=IL-Home>{{cite web| title =Author's Northern Indiana Home Prepares for Next Chapter: A Rural Retreat | publisher =Indiana Landmarks | date =January 23, 2019 | url=https://www.indianalandmarks.org/2019/01/authors-northern-indiana-home-prepares-for-next-chapter/ | access-date =June 11, 2019}}</ref>

Not all of Ade's theatrical productions were successes, such as ''The Bad Samaritan'' (1905), but three of his plays (''The College Widow'', ''The Sho-Gun'', and ''The County Chairman'') were simultaneously appearing on Broadway in 1904. The best known and among the most successful of Ade's Broadway plays are ''The County Chairman'' and ''The College Widow'', which were also adapted into motion pictures. Ade's final Broadway play before he retired from playwriting was ''The Old Town'', produced in 1910.<ref name=PurdueLib-Bio/><ref name=Maston18-22/><ref name=IL-Home/> 

After Ade retired from writing Broadway plays in 1910, he continued to write one-act plays that small theater companies presented in theatres across the United States.<ref name=GS4-5>Gugin and St. Clair, eds., pp. 4–5.</ref> ''Marse Covington'' is considered to be among the best of his one-act plays. Ade also wrote scripts for moving pictures, such as ''[[Our Leading Citizen (1922 film)|Our Leading Citizen]]'' (1922 silent film), ''[[Back Home and Broke]]'' (1922 silent film), and ''[[Woman-Proof]]'' (1923 silent film) for actor [[Thomas Meighan]]. Ade also wrote two films for [[Will Rogers]], ''U.S. Minister Bedlow'' and ''[[The County Chairman (1935 film)|The County Chairman]]'', a 1935 screen version of [[The County Chairman (play)|the play]], but Ade did not get along with Hollywood filmmakers.<ref name=PurdueLib-Bio/><ref>Matson, pp. 23–24 and 26.</ref>

By the mid-1920s, Ade's plays were no longer in fashion, but he continued to write essays, short stories, and articles for newspapers and magazines in addition to film scripts.<ref>Matson, p. 27.</ref> Ade also wrote about his extensive travels, but he is best known for his humorous columns, essays, books, and plays. His fables in slang stories and series of books, in addition to making him wealthy, gained him notoriety as an American writer.<ref name=Authors-Ade/><ref name=Newberry/> His final book, ''The Old-Time Saloon'', was published in 1931.<ref name=PurdueLib-Bio/>

==Writing style==
[[File:George Ade 7.jpg|thumb|right|180px|George Ade, 1903]]

Ade's literary reputation rests upon his achievements as a humorist of American character. When the United States began a population shift as the first large wave of migration from rural communities to urban cities and the county transitioned from an agrarian to an industrial economy, Ade used his wit and keen observational skills to record in his writings the efforts of ordinary people to get along and to cope with these changes. Because Ade grew up in a [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] farming community and also knew about urban living in cities like Chicago, he could develop stories and dialog that realistically captured daily life in either of these settings. His fictional men and women typically represented the common, undistinguished, average Americans, who were who were often "suspicious of poets, saints, reformers, eccentricity, snobbishness, and affectation," as well as newcomers.<ref name=Greasley28-29>Shumaker, Arthur, "George Ade," in {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZnuYKJSoHCMC&q=allintext%3A+%22George+Ade%22+capitalization&pg=PR4 |title=Dictionary of Midwestern Literature|author=Greasley, Philip A. |publisher=Indiana University Press | location =Bloomington |year=2001|pages=28–29| isbn =0-253-33609-0}}</ref>

While his humor depicts Midwestern speech and manners, it also reflects mannerisms found in late 19th-century America as well. Like Ade himself, his characters also found humor in everyday experiences, mocked pretentious social situations, and tried not take life too seriously.<ref name=Greasley28-29/> Using a writing style similar to [[Mark Twain]]'s, Ade was adept in the use of the American language. Ade's fables in slang," for example, were written in the American colloquial vernacular. He also offered genial satire and provided "a social record of how ridiculous some people make themselves."<ref name=Greasley28-29/> 

Striking features of Ade's essays and fables in slang are his creative figures of speech and liberal use of capitalization.<ref name=Greasley28-29/><ref>{{cite web|author=Sante, Luc | title =George Ade | publisher =HILOBROW | date =February 9, 2011 |url=http://hilobrow.com/2011/02/09/george-ade/ | access-date =June 11, 2019}}</ref> An example of Ade's non-standard punctuation and writing style appears in this description of a modern single woman and what Ade believes to be her high standards for an ideal husband: {{quote|Once upon a Time there was a slim Girl with a Forehead which was Shiny and Protuberant, like a Bartlett Pear.... In all the Country around there was not a Man who came up to her Plans and Specifications for a Husband. Neither was there any Man who had any time for Her. So she led a lonely Life, dreaming of the One—the Ideal. He was a big and pensive Literary Man, wearing a Prince Albert coat, a neat Derby Hat and godlike Whiskers. When He came he would enfold Her in his Arms and whisper Emerson's Essays to her.

In 1915, Sir Walter Raleigh, Oxford professor and man of letters, while on a lecture tour in America, called George Ade "the greatest living American writer."<ref>{{cite book|last=Coyle|first=Lee|title=George Ade|url=https://archive.org/details/georgeade00coyl|url-access=registration|year=1964|publisher=Twayne Publisher, Inc.|location=New York|page=7}}</ref> [[H.

==Personal life==
[[File:George Ade House.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ade's house near Brook, Indiana]]

===Hazelden farm===
{{main|George Ade House}}
By the early 1900s, after twelve years in Chicago, Ade's writing had brought him financial success and he retired to a leisurely life in the country. Ade invested his earnings in Newton County, Indiana, farmland, eventually owning about {{convert|2400|acre|hectare}}.<ref name=IL-Home/><ref name=Boomhower63-64>Boomhower, pp. 63–64.</ref> In 1902, George's brother, William Ade, purchased on his behalf a {{convert|417|acre|hectare|sing=on}} site of wooded land along the [[Iroquois River (Indiana-Illinois)|Iroquois River]] near the town of [[Brook, Indiana|Brook]] in [[Newton County, Indiana]]. George initially intended to build a summer cottage. Instead, Chicago architect Billie Mann, a Sigma Chi fraternity brother, designed for Ade a two-story, fourteen-room country manor, which was constructed at an estimated cost of US$25,000. Ade named the property Hazelden, after his English grandparents' home, and moved from Chicago into the newly built residence in 1904. In addition to the Tudor Revival-style home, the property eventually included landscaped grounds, a swimming pool, greenhouse, barn, and caretaker's cottage, among other outbuildings. Ade also added an adjacent golf course and country club in 1910.<ref name=IL-Home/><ref name=Boomhower63-64/><ref name="SHAARD">{{cite web| url = https://secure.in.gov/apps/dnr/shaard/welcome.html| title = Indiana State Historic Architectural and Archaeological Research Database (SHAARD) | publisher = Department of Natural Resources, Division of Historic Preservation and Archaeology | format = Searchable database| access-date =June 10, 2019}} ''Note:'' This includes {{cite web| url=https://secure.in.gov/apps/dnr/shaard/r/18d05/N/Ade_George_House_Newton_CO_Nom.pdf| title = National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: George Ade House| access-date = June 10, 2019| author=George R.

Ade frequently entertained at his Indiana estate. In addition to serving as a summer home (and his permanent residence beginning in 1905), Hazelden was used for political gatherings and community events. Hazelden was the site where [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[William Howard Taft]] announced his candidacy for president of the United States and launched his campaign in 1908. It was also used as the site for a political rally for [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Bull Moose Party]] in 1912 and a venue for an address from vice presidential candidate Charles W. Dawes in 1924. (Ade, a political conservative, supported [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] candidates.) Ade also hosted a homecoming party for soldiers and sailors on July 4, 1919, as well as parties and gatherings for the community, local children, Purdue University alumni, Sigma Chi fraternity brothers, members of the Indiana Society of Chicago, and golf tournaments.<ref name=Newberry/><ref name=Boomhower63-64/><ref name=Castle-Bio>"Biographical Sketch" in {{cite book | author=Emily Castle | title =George Ade Letter, 6 may 1923 Collection Guide | publisher =Indiana Historical Society | year =2006 | location =Indianapolis | url =https://indianahistory.org/wp-content/uploads/george-ade-letter-6-may-1923.pdf  }}</ref>

===Other interests===
Ade spent the summer months at his Hazelden estate in Newton County, Indiana, and vacationed during the winter months at a rented home in Miami, Florida. He was also an avid traveler who made trips around the world, as well as multiple trips to Europe, the [[West Indies]], China, and Japan. In addition to his frequent travels, Ade enjoyed horse racing and golf.<ref name=GS4-5/><ref name=Newberry/>

Ade, who never married, corresponded regularly with a wide circle of friends and was active in literary, civic, and political organizations. In 1905 he was a cofounder with Edward M. Holloway and John T. McCutcheon of the Indiana Society of Chicago, a literary organization. Ade also served as a delegate to the [[1908 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] in Chicago in 1908.<ref name=GS4-5/><ref name=Newberry/> 

Ade was a longtime supporter of Purdue University and [[Sigma Chi]],his college fraternity. He served as national president of Sigma Chi in his later years<ref name=Matson9/><ref name=Newberry/> and as a member of Purdue's board of trustees from 1909 to 1916. Ade was also a member of the Purdue Alumni Association.<ref name=PurdueLib-Bio/> Ade donated funds for construction of Purdue's Memorial Gymnasium and its Memorial Union Building. In 1922, Ade and [[David Edward Ross]], another Purdue alumni, bought {{convert|65|acre|hectare}} of land for use as the site of a new football stadium at Purdue's campus in [[West Lafayette, Indiana]]. In addition, Ade and Ross provided financial support construction of the facility, which was formally dedicated on November 22, 1924, and named [[Ross–Ade Stadium]] in their honor.<ref name=GS4-5/><ref name=Castle-Bio/> Ade also led a fund-raising campaign to endow the Sigma Chi mother house at [[Miami University]], where the fraternity was originally established. Ade also authored the ''[[Sigma Chi]] Creed'' in 1929, which is one of the central documents of the fraternity's philosophies.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

In his later years Ade was a member of National Institute of Arts and Letters ([[American Academy of Arts and Letters]]) and an executive committee member of the [[Authors Guild]]. Purdue University awarded Ade an honorary degree in the humanities in 1926 and [[Indiana University]] awarded him an honorary law degree in 1927. During the early 1940s, he also served as president of the Mark Twain Association of America. Ade's activities slowed after he suffered a stroke in June 1943 that left him partially paralyzed and a series of heart attacks in 1944.<ref name=PurdueLib-Bio/><ref name=Kelly-Satirist264-65>{{cite book | author=Kelly, Fred| title =George Ade, Warmhearted Satirist | publisher =Bobbs-Merrill Company | year =1947 | location =Indianapolis, Indiana| pages =264–65 | oclc=606708}}</ref>

==Death and legacy==
Ade fell into a coma after suffering a heart attack and died on May 16, 1944, in [[Brook, Indiana]], at the age of seventy-eight. His remains are interred at Fairlawn Cemetery in Kentland, in Iroquois Township, Newton County, Indiana.<ref name=Kelly-Satirist264-65/>

Ade is considered a humorist, satirist, and a moralist with keen observational skills, as well as and "one of the greatest writers of his time."<ref name=Greasley28-29/> Ade's writings reached the height of their popularity in the 1910s and 1920s. Along with the works of other [[Hoosier]] writers, such as [[James Whitcomb Riley]], [[Booth Tarkington]], and [[Meredith Nicholson]], among others, Ade's writing was part of the [[Golden Age of Indiana Literature]] of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. His fables in slang gained him wealth and fame as an American humorist, in addition to earning him the nickname of the "Aesop of Indiana."<ref name=IL-Home/> In more recent decades, his works have been largely forgotten.<ref name=GS3-4/> 

The best known of his plays that were produced on Broadway are ''The County Chairman'' and ''The College Widow'', which were also adapted into motion pictures.<ref name=PurdueLib-Bio/> While the presentations of his plays and musical comedies increased his wealth and international renown, Ade's legacy includes numerous newspaper columns, magazine articles, essays, and books that describe his perspective on American life in the late nineteenth and early decades of the twentieth century.<ref name=Authors-Ade/> 

Ade bequeathed his library, manuscripts, and papers, as well as most of his art objects to Purdue University.<ref name=Satirist266>Kelly, ''George Ade, Warmhearted Satirist'', p. 266.</ref> Following Ade's death, ownership of [[George Ade House|Hazelden]], his former home in Newton County, Indiana, was transferred to Purdue University, who relinquished the property to the State of Indiana when it could no longer afford its upkeep. The State of Indiana, unable to maintain the home, turned it over to Newton County, Indiana, officials. Ade's remaining land was distributed among his relatives. In 1962 the George Ade Memorial Association raised funds to acquire, renovate, and restore the home.<ref name=Boomhower63-64/><ref name=Satirist266/> Hazelden (the [[George Ade House]]) was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1976.<ref name="nris">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref> The Association disbanded in 2018, and, as of 2019, Newton county officials are assessing the home's condition and plans for restoring it for use as a public historic site and events venue.<ref name=IL-Home/>

* [[P. G. Wodehouse]] refers to Ade's "The Fable of the Author Who Was Sorry for What He Did to Willie" in ''Love Among the Chickens'' (1909).<ref>Wodehouse wrote: "The whole thing began like Mr. George Ade's fable of the author. An author — myself — was sitting at his desk trying to turn out something that could be converted into breakfast food, when a friend came in and sat down on the table and told him to go right on and not mind him." (Chapter XII, ''Love Among the Chickens'') Wodehouse also wrote: "I felt, like the man in the fable, as if some one had played a mean trick on me, and substituted for my brain a side order of cauliflower." (Chapter XVI''Love Among the Chickens'') Wodehouse makes a reference to the "mean trick" again in ''Mike'' (1909): "But that Adair should inform him, two minutes after Mr. Downing's announcement of Psmith's confession, that Psmith, too, was guiltless, and that the real criminal was Dunster — it was this that made him feel that somebody, in the words of an American author, had played a mean trick on him, and substituted for his brain a side-order of cauliflower." (Chapter LVIII, ''Mike'')</ref>
