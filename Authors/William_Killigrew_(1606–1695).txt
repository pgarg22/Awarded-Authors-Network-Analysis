'''Sir William Killigrew''' (1606–1695) of [[Kempton Park, Surrey|Kempton Park]],<ref>[[History of Parliament]] biography [http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1604-1629/member/killigrew-sir-william-ii-1606-1695 KILLIGREW, Sir William II (1606-1695), of Pendennis Castle, Cornw.; later of Lincoln's Inn Fields, London and Kempton Park, Mdx.]</ref> Middlesex, was an [[England|English]] court official under [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and [[Charles II of England|Charles II]].<ref>[[ODNB]] article by J. P. Vander Motten, ‘Killigrew, Sir William (bap. 1606, d. 1695)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/15541], accessed 9 September 2007</ref>

He was the son of Sir [[Robert Killigrew]] (d. 1633/5) and [[Mary Woodhouse]], of [[Kimberley, Norfolk]], his wife. He was the elder brother to [[Thomas Killigrew]]. By his wife Mary, daughter of John Hill of Honilay, Warwickshire, he had three sons: Henry (d. 1661), William, a captain in the army, and Sir Robert. Their daughter Elizabeth (d. 1677) married Francis Clinton, 6th [[Earl of Lincoln]]<ref>Dictionary of National Biography, 1885-1900, Volume 31. Killigrew, William by John Joseph Knight</ref> with whom she had one child, Francis Clinton, who died in infancy.<ref>Mosley, Charles, editor.

Killigrew was knighted in May 1626. He was elected MP for [[Newport (Cornwall) (UK Parliament constituency)|Newport]] and [[Penryn (UK Parliament constituency)|Penryn]], Cornwall in March 1628, but only sat for the latter. In 1629, he and his father were jointly awarded the Governorship of [[Pendennis Castle]]. However, after some trouble, he resigned in favour of Sir [[Nicholas Slanning]]<ref>Sir [[Nicholas Slanning]] (1606&ndash;43), English Civil War hero. Not to be confused with his son of the same name, who was MP for Penryn 1679-89.</ref> in April 1635.

In 1634, he granted a 99-year lease of 6 shares of land ({{convert|150|acre}}) in [[Hamilton Tribe]] of [[Bermuda]] to his uncle, [[Henry Woodhouse (governor)|Henry Woodhouse]], former governor of Bermuda.  The rent was nominal – 100 oranges, 100 lemons and 100 potatoes, payable at the Feast of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary – but Woodhouse did not keep up the payments. In 1637, Killigrew reclaimed the land.<ref>{{cite book |author=College Quarterly|title=Genealogies of Virginia Families from the William and Mary College Quarterly

With partners, he attempted to drain the [[Lincolnshire]] [[Fens]], an immensely expensive undertaking. This involved him in considerable local strife.<ref>James Boyce ''Imperial Mud: The Fight for the Fens'', Icon Books, 2020.</ref> During the [[English Civil War]] he gave loyal and effective support to the King.

In 1646 he presented himself to the directors of the [[Levant Company]] and insisted that he was the king's choice as ambassador to [[Constantinople]]. His candidacy was not considered.<ref>Daniel Goffman, Britons in the Ottoman Empire, 1642-1660 (Seattle & London, 1998), p. 90.</ref>

At the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] he was made the Queen's [[Chamberlain (office)|Vice-Chamberlain]], an influential and well-rewarded post. In 1663 Killigrew published ''[https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=eebo;idno=A47388.0001.001 A proposal, shewing how this nation may be vast gainers by all the sums of money, given to the Crown, . . .]'' in which he advocated that the government issue £2m in transferable [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] with the interest being covered by a yearly tax of £300k. The bonds would be for denominations between £5 and £100, mostly in the smaller denominations. The state would provide a regulatory framework to avoid fraud and ensure they were accepted as legal tender.<ref name="Wennerlind">{{cite book |last1=Wennerlind |first1=Carl |title=Casualties of Credit: The English Financial Revolution, 1620-172 |date=2011 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |url=https://epdf.pub/queue/casualties-of-credit-the-english-financial-revolution-1620-1720.html |language=en}}</ref>{{rp|101}} The proposal was implemented by [[Secretary of the Treasury]], [[Sir George Downing, 1st Baronet|George Downing]], who started issuing Treasury Orders. Initially he hoped to side step the financial power of the [[goldsmith banker]]s. However, by 1672 most of the orders were in the hands of a handful of such bankers, and so ended up increasing their power.<ref name="Wennerlind"/>{{rp|103}}

From 1664 to 1679 he was [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Richmond (Yorks) (UK Parliament constituency)|Richmond]] in [[Yorkshire]].

He was the author of four plays of some merit.<ref>"some merit": this is the judgement of the 1911 edition of ''Britannica''. [[ODNB]] assigns them "limited literary value", but great historical interest.</ref> The four dramas, with their dates of publication, are:

* ''Ormasdes, or Love and Friendship'' (1664)
* ''Pandora, or the Converts'' (1664)
* ''Selindra'' (1664)
* ''The Siege of Urbin'' (1666).

The [[tragicomedy]] ''The Siege of Urbin'' has often been considered his best play. Poet [[Edmund Waller]] addressed verses to Killigrew on the subject of ''Pandora'', which indicate that the play was originally a tragedy; Killigrew revised it into a comedy after the tragic version failed onstage.<ref>James Orchard Halliwell-Phillipps and David Erskine Baker, ''A Dictionary of Old English Plays'', London, J. R. Smith, 1860; p. 188.</ref>
