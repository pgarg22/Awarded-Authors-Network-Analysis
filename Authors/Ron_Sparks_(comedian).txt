'''Ron Sparks''' (born May 20, 1977) is a Canadian comedian, actor, writer and producer. He was born in [[Chatham-Kent, Ontario]] and lives in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]]. He is best known as an [[alternative comedy|alternative comedian]] and frequent guest on [[CBC Radio 1|CBC Radio]]'s [[The Debaters]], and on TV as a regular and favourite juror on [[MuchMusic]]'s highest-rated show, ''[[Video on Trial]]'', also starring as The Judge in the ''[[Stars on Trial]]'' Christmas special and various other ''VOT'' spin-offs.

==Comedy==

===Theatre===

Sparks enjoyed performing in plays and sketches as a student, and at CKSS began writing scripts to perform in drama class and at assemblies. He did a sketch with fellow student Corey St. Peter about a refugee applying for Canadian citizenship at a televised [[swearing-in|swearing-in ceremony]] which he claims was met with total silence, saying "we were sure it was because they didn't understand English, but I've come to accept that we probably just stunk."

In high school and university he found success as a playwright. His farce ''Chuck Sent Me'' won the [[Grand Theatre, Ontario|Grand Theatre]] Stage Presence Competition for young playwrights in 1997.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=http://doollee.com/PlaywrightsS/sparks-ron.php|title=Ron Sparks|website=doollee.com}}</ref> His one act plays ''Richard Keats' Apartment of Doom'' and ''Home to Mother'', a [[dramedy]], both won the York University competition for playwrights in 2000 and 2001.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vaniercollegeproductions.com/1999-2000.html |title=Vanier College Productions|publisher=York University |date=June 2000}}</ref> Other works include ''A Thanksgiving That Would Even Make Great Aunt Gladys Proud'' (2nd place, 1999) and ''My Favourite Aunt'' (3rd place, 2001).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vaniercollegeproductions.com/2000-2001.html |title=Vanier College Productions|publisher=York University |date=May 2001}}</ref> ''Apartment of Doom'' and ''My Favourite Aunt'' would both be remounted as [[Toronto Fringe Festival]] shows.<ref name="auto"/>

At [[York University]], Sparks wrote humorous articles and reviews for the student newspaper ''The Vandoo'' and was promoted to an editor, but quit after complaints and new guidelines from college administration made the job too constraining to be fun.

===Improv and sketch===

Sparks first began performing comedy regularly with [[York University]]'s ''Vanier Improv Company'' as a student,<ref>https://www.findglocal.com/CA/Toronto/226398170735130/Vanier-College-Productions</ref> where he became a standout and met his [[sketch comedy|sketch]] troupe mates ''[[The Minnesota Wrecking Crew]]''. They would go on to be nominated four straight years (2003–2006) for the ''Best Sketch Troupe'' [[Canadian Comedy Award]], winning in 2003 and 2004. In 2006 they won again for ''Best Taped Live Performance'' for the [[CBC Television|CBC]] special ''[[Kevin McDonald|Sketch with Kevin McDonald]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.liveact.ca/pc_20151127.html |title=Premier Comedy|publisher=liveact.ca |date=December 30, 2016}}</ref><br> 

''The MWC'' became the "house troupe" at [[The Second City|Second City Toronto]]'s ''Sketchy at Best'' showcase,<ref>{{cite news|title=Sketchy Behaviour|work=NOW Magazine|url=https://nowtoronto.com/culture/comedy/sketchy-behaviour|access-date=November 18, 2021|language=en-CA}}</ref> where they would perform sets of mostly new sketches every week.<br>

After his first year with the VIC and Vanier College Productions, Sparks was asked to perform in the following year's annual [[frosh week]] orientation show for new students. He got a lot of laughs and his first ever requests for autographs from the audience, "unfortunately I was playing a date rapist and it wasn't supposed to be funny, so the director got an earful and they never produced that play again".<br>

Sparks was also a member of the sketch troupes ''Rocket 9'', ''Gazebo Pals''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://trnto.com/meet-a-comedian-ron-sparks/|title=Meet a Comedian: Ron Sparks|first=Brianne Hogan for|last=TRNTO|date=July 30, 2012}}</ref> and the [[Canadian Comedy Award|CCA]]-nominated ''Shoeless''. 

===Stand-up===

After performing on the show with the ''Wrecking Crew'' a few times, he began working the door for Toronto's legendary [[ALTdot COMedy Lounge]] at the [[The Rivoli|Rivoli]] in 2002. At show producer Zoe Rabnett's urging, he tried performing stand-up in 2003 at [[The ALTdot COMedy Lounge]] and then won that year's [[Tim Sims Award]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Vanier sparked winning comedian's career|url=https://yfile.news.yorku.ca/2003/12/15/vanier-sparked-winning-comedian%E2%80%99s-career/|access-date=November 18, 2021|website=yorku.ca|language=en-CA}}</ref> given to Toronto's most promising new comedy act,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.postcity.com/Eat-Shop-Do/Do/July-2012/Meet-a-Comedian-Ron-Sparks/ |title=Meet a Comedian: Ron Sparks|publisher=postcity.com |date=July 30, 2012 |access-date=30 December 2016}}</ref> in just his 20th set. He then also won the 2004 Canadian Comedy Award for ''Best Stand-up Newcomer'', becoming the first person to win both. [[Frank Magazine]] described him as "the next stand-up wunderkind".

===''Canadian Comedy Awards''===
At the 2007 Awards' "State of the Industry" event, Ron was unofficially voted "North America's Sexiest Comedian" by acclaim after host [[Harry Doupe]] ran his name against [[Nicole Arbour]]. This was in response to Arbour having billed herself with that title despite never actually having won it anywhere. Neither comedian was in attendance.
