'''Edith Constance Holme''' (7 October 1880 â€“ 17 June 1955), married name '''Punchard''', was an English writer and [[playwright]]. She was born in [[Milnthorpe]], Westmorland (now in [[Cumbria]]), the youngest of fourteen children. Her novels are set in the old county of [[Westmorland]], where she lived most of her life.

Many of Holme's works explore class relationships; her first two books focus on the three-way relationships between landowners, tenant farmers and [[land agent]]s (Holme's father and her husband were both land agents).

Uniquely among twentieth-century authors, all of Holme's novels and her book of short stories were published in the [[Oxford World's Classics]] series.<ref name=DLB>{{cite web | author=Stewart, Charlotte| title=(Edith) Constance Holme | publisher=Thompson Gale | work=Dictionary of Literary Biography | url=http://www.bookrags.com/biography/edith-constance-holme-dlb/ | accessdate=2006-09-07 }}</ref> ''The Lonely Plough'' was also, in 1936, among the first novels published by [[Penguin Books|Penguin]].<ref name=Peng>{{cite web | title=List of Penguins 1-50 | url=http://www.spingal.plus.com/penguins/penguins_list.html | accessdate=2006-09-14 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827042215/http://www.spingal.plus.com/penguins/penguins_list.html | archivedate=27 August 2006 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Despite this, her reputation faded quickly after her death; indeed, it had been questioned even during her own lifetime, with [[Saturday Review (London)|The Saturday Review]] commenting in 1938, "We are still hunting for someone who has actually read Constance Holme's novels."<ref name=DLB/> Some of her books were reprinted during the 1970s; however, her final work, ''The Jasper Sea'', remains unpublished.
