'''Caitlín Rebekah Kiernan''' (born 26 May 1964)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://greygirlbeast.livejournal.com/1384522.html|title=23|last=greygirlbeast|date=2018-05-26|website=Postcards from the Red Room|access-date=2018-06-10}}</ref> is an Irish-born American published paleontologist and author of science fiction and [[dark fantasy]] works, including ten novels, series of comic books, and more than two hundred and fifty published short stories, novellas, and [[Vignette (literature)|vignette]]s. Kiernan is a two-time recipient of both the World Fantasy and Bram Stoker awards.

== Early life ==
[[File:C R Kiernan.jpeg|thumb|right|Kiernan in 2001.]]
Kiernan was born in 1964 in [[Skerries, Dublin|Skerries]], [[County Dublin]], Ireland. After the death of their father, Kiernan moved to the United States as a young child with their mother<ref name="AmSupTales_Kiernan">{{cite book |editor1-last=Joshi |editor1-first=S.T. (volume editor) |editor2-last=del Toro |editor2-first=Guillermo (series editor) |title=American Supernatural Tales |date=2013 |publisher=Penguin USA |location=New York |isbn=9781101662755 |page=354}}</ref> Susan Ramey Cleveland and younger sister Mary Angela (Máire Aingeal). Much of their childhood was spent in the small town of [[Leeds, Alabama]], and early interests included [[herpetology]], [[paleontology]], and fiction writing. As a teenager, Kiernan lived in [[Trussville, Alabama]], and, in high school, began doing volunteer work at the [[Red Mountain, Birmingham, Alabama#Red Mountain Museum|Red Mountain Museum]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] and spending summers on their first [[archaeological]] and paleontological digs.

Kiernan attended college at the [[University of Alabama at Birmingham]] and the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]], studying geology and vertebrate paleontology,<ref name="AmSupTales_Kiernan"/> and held both museum and teaching positions before finally turning to fiction writing in 1992.

==Career==

===Paleontology===
In 1984, Kiernan co-founded the Birmingham Paleontological Society. In 1988, they co-authored a paper describing the new [[genus]] and [[species]] of [[mosasaur]], ''[[Selmasaurus]] russelli''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-3823|title=Caitlin R. Kiernan|date=2016-09-21|website=Encyclopedia of Alabama|access-date=2019-05-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Caitlin_Kiernan|title=Caitlin R. Kiernan's researcher profile|website=[[ResearchGate]]|access-date=2019-05-16}}</ref> More recent papers include one on the [[biostratigraphy]] of Alabama [[mosasaur]]s, published in the ''[[Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology]]'' (2002) and "First record of a velociraptorine [[theropod]] ([[Tetanurae]], [[Dromaeosauridae]]) from the Eastern Gulf Coastal United States" (2004).

As of 2019, Kiernan is a research associate and fossil preparator at [[McWane Science Center]] in Birmingham, Alabama, again studying mosasaurs. In 2020, they coauthored on a paper describing a new large fossil sea turtle, ''Asmodochelys parhami'', from the [[Demopolis Chalk]] of Alabama.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Gentry|first1=Andrew D.|last2=Ebersole|first2=Jun A.|last3=Kiernan|first3=Caitlin R.|title=Asmodochelys parhami, a new fossil marine turtle from the Campanian Demopolis Chalk and the stratigraphic congruence of competing marine turtle phylogenies|url= |journal=Royal Society Open Science|year=2019|volume=6|issue=12|pages=191950|doi=10.1098/rsos.191950|pmc=6936288|pmid=31903219|bibcode=2019RSOS....691950G}}</ref> In 2021, Kiernan also joined the staff of the [[University of Alabama]] Museum, Department of Research and Collections, as a Research Associate in Vertebrate Paleontology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://collections.museums.ua.edu/staff-directory/|title=Staff Directory – Research & Collections}}</ref>

Kiernan has been a member of the [[Society of Vertebrate Paleontology]] since 1984 and is a member of the [[American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists]]. At various times, they have been a member of the Alabama Academy of Science, the [[Paleontological Society]], [[Sigma Xi]], the [[Society of Sedimentary Geology]], and the [[Paleontological Research Institution]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://greygirlbeast.livejournal.com/943990.html|title = .Paleontology and I|date = 6 January 2013}}</ref>

=== Novels, short fiction, and comics ===
Kiernan's first novel, ''The Five of Cups'', was written between June 1992 and early 1993, though it was not published until 2003. Their first published short story was "Persephone", a dark science fiction tale released in 1995. Their first published novel, ''Silk'', was released in 1998.

Kiernan's short fiction was selected for ''[[Year's Best Fantasy and Horror]]'' series, ''The Mammoth Book of Best New Horror'', and ''The Year's Best Science Fiction'', and their short stories have been collected in several volumes (see Bibliography). To date, Kiernan's work has been translated into German, Italian, Chinese, French, Turkish, Spanish, Portuguese, Finnish, Czech, Polish, Russian, Korean, and Japanese.

Kiernan was approached by writer [[Neil Gaiman]] and editors at [[Vertigo Comics]] to write for ''[[The Dreaming (comics)|The Dreaming]]'', a spin-off from Gaiman's ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'', and did so from 1996 until its conclusion in 2001, focusing on both pre-existing characters (the Corinthian, Cain and Abel, Lucien, Nuala, Morpheus, Thessaly, etc.) and creating new characters (Echo, Maddy, the white dream raven Tethys, etc.).<ref name="vert-drea">{{Cite book  | last = Irvine | first = Alex | author-link = Alexander C. Irvine | contribution = The Dreaming | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The Vertigo Encyclopedia  | pages = 64–65 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-7566-4122-1 | oclc = 213309015}}</ref> They wrote the [[novelisation|novelization]] for the 2007 ''[[Beowulf (2007 film)|Beowulf]]'' film (scripted by Gaiman and [[Roger Avary]]). Kiernan later scripted ''Alabaster: Wolves'' (2012) for [[Dark Horse Comics]], continuing with ''Alabaster: Grimmer Tales'' (2013) and ''Alabaster: The Good, the Bad, and the Bird'' (2014).

===Film and screenwriting===
[[Josh Boone (director)|Josh Boone]]'s Mid-World Productions has optioned both ''The Red Tree'' and ''The Drowning Girl'' to develop into feature films. Kiernan is writing the screenplay for ''The Red Tree'', and Boone will be writing ''The Drowning Girl''. Kiernan stated, "A few people have asked questions about the films and preserving the queerness of the novels. This is something you do not have to worry about. Also, though no details can be released yet and nothing is certain, the hope is that we can cast a transgender actress as Abalyn Armitage."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://greygirlbeast.livejournal.com/1134014.html |title=...at the late night double-feature picture show. |last=greygirlbeast |publisher=greygirlbeast.livejournal.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150801232441/http://greygirlbeast.livejournal.com/1134014.html |archive-date=1 August 2015 |df=dmy-all |date=25 July 2015 }}</ref>

==Style and genre==
Kiernan's blog states:
{{bquote|I'm getting tired of telling people that I'm not a 'horror' writer. I'm getting tired of them not listening, or not believing. Most of them seem suspicious of my motives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caitlinrkiernan.com/2002/02/chapter-two-proceeds-apace.html|title=Chapter Two proceeds apace|access-date=18 May 2007|last=Kiernan|first=Caitlín R.|date=3 February 2002|work=Low Red Moon journal}}</ref>

I've never tried to fool anyone. I've said I don't write genre 'horror.' A million, billion times have I said that.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kiernan|first=Caitlín R.|title=It's a death trap. It's a suicide rap.|url=http://greygirlbeast.livejournal.com/992879.html#comments|work=Dear Sweet Filthy World|publisher=livejournal.com|access-date=24 July 2013|date=24 July 2013}}</ref>

It's not that there are not strong elements of horror present in a lot of my writing. It's that horror never predominates those works. You may as well call it psychological fiction or awe fiction. I don't think of horror as a genre. I think of it – to paraphrase [[Douglas E. Winter|Doug Winter]] – as an emotion, and no one emotion will ever characterize my fiction.<ref>{{cite web|last=VanderMeer|first=Jeff|title=Interview: Caitlín R. Kiernan on Weird Fiction|url=http://weirdfictionreview.com/2012/03/interview-caitlin-r-kiernan-on-weird-fiction/|work=Deep time is critical...|publisher=Weird Fiction Review|access-date=25 July 2013|date=12 March 2012}}</ref>}}

Much of Kiernan's earlier work, such as ''Silk'', is set among or alludes to the aesthetics of the [[Goth subculture|goth]] and [[punk rock]] subcultures, elements which are generally absent in their later novels.

Kiernan has also stated, regarding the role of plot in creative writing: "anyone can come up with the artifice/conceit of a 'good story.' Story bores me. Which is why critics complain it's the weakest aspect of my work. Because that's essentially purposeful. I have no real interest in plot. Atmosphere, mood, language, character, theme, etc., that's the stuff that fascinates me. [[Ulysses (novel)|''Ulysses'']] should have freed writers from plot."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://greygirlbeast.livejournal.com/1021886.html |title=Howard Hughes and the End of November |last=greygirlbeast |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150507014220/http://greygirlbeast.livejournal.com/1021886.html |archive-date=7 May 2015 |df=dmy-all |date=30 November 2013 }}</ref>

In his review of ''The Red Tree'', [[H. P. Lovecraft]] scholar [[S. T. Joshi]] writes: "Kiernan already ranks with the most distinctive stylists in our field – [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Lord Dunsany]], [[Thomas Ligotti]]. With Ligotti's regrettable retreat into fictional silence, hers is now the voice of [[weird fiction]]."<ref>''Dead Reckonings'' (No. 6, Volume 2009, pp. 28–30)</ref> In their introduction to ''The Weird'', Ann and [[Jeff VanderMeer]] write that Kiernan has "become perhaps the best weird writer of her generation."<ref>''The Weird'' (Atlantic Books Ltd., 2011, p. xix)</ref>

== Music ==
In 1996 and 1997, Kiernan fronted an [[Athens, Georgia|Athens]], Georgia-based "[[Gothic rock|goth]]-folk-blues band," Death's Little Sister,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caitlinrkiernan.com/music.html|title=Musical projects}}</ref> named for Neil Gaiman's character [[Endless (comics)|Delirium]]. They were the band's vocalist and lyricist, and the group enjoyed some success on local college radio and played shows in Athens and [[Atlanta]]. Other members included Barry Dillard (guitars), Michael Graves (bass), and Shelly Ross (keyboards). Kiernan left the band in February 1997 because of their increased responsibilities writing for [[DC Comics]] and because ''Silk'' had recently sold.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} They were briefly involved in Crimson Stain Mystery, a studio project, two years later, which produced one [[Extended play|EP]] to accompany a special limited edition of ''Silk'', illustrated by [[Clive Barker]] (Gauntlet Press, 2000).

==Publishing==
In December 2005, Kiernan began publishing the monthly ''Sirenia Digest''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caitlinrkiernan.com/sirenia.html|title=sirenia|access-date=18 May 2007|last=Kiernan|first=Caitlín R. }}</ref> (otherwise known as MerViSS) consisting of vignettes and short stories: "The MerViSS Project is a continuation of Kiernan's exploration of the fusion of erotic literature with elements of dark fantasy and science fiction, creating brief, dreamlike fictions." It is illustrated by [[Vince Locke]]. The digest includes the occasional collaboration with [[Sonya Taaffe]].

==Archives==

The Caitlín R. Kiernan Papers at the [[John Hay Library]] at [[Brown University]] consist of twenty-three linear feet of manuscript materials, including correspondence, journals, manuscripts, and publications, circa 1970–2017, in print, electronic, and web-based formats, as well as their first computer and other artifacts of their career. Additions to the collection are regularly made by the author. In 2017, a formal reception was held at the Hay Library to announce the collection and to unveil "Caitlín R. Kiernan Papers @ Brown University Library," an exhibit based on them.<ref>{{citation|title=H.P. Lovecraft on the Road & Caitlín R.

==Personal life==
In their twenties, Kiernan identified as [[transgender]] and transitioned to female,<ref name=":0" /> further identifying as lesbian.<ref name=":1" /> In 2020 Kiernan stated, "I no longer consider myself transgender (or transsexual). I would say that I'm gender fluid, if I had to say anything," explaining that this was not a recognized option in the 1980s.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=sentient globs of plesiomorphies|url=https://greygirlbeast.livejournal.com/1544222.html|last=greygirlbeast|date=2020-04-30|website=Dear Sweet Filthy World|access-date=2020-05-02}}</ref> They added that male or female pronouns do not offend them, but prefer "''they, them, and their".''<ref name=":0" />

Kiernan has identified as an atheist [[pagan]].<ref name=":1">{{cite web|url=http://greygirlbeast.livejournal.com/883678.html |title=And barefoot in the shallow creek, I grabbed some stones from underneath |last=greygirlbeast |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150507014249/http://greygirlbeast.livejournal.com/883678.html |archive-date=7 May 2015 |df=dmy-all |date=21 May 2012 }}</ref>
