'''Leonid Nikolaievich Andreyev''' ({{lang-ru|Леони́д Никола́евич Андре́ев}}, {{OldStyleDate|21 August|1871|9 August}} – 12 September 1919) was a [[Russian language|Russian]] playwright, novelist and short-story writer, who is considered to be a father of [[Expressionism]] in Russian literature. He is regarded as one of the most talented and prolific representatives of the [[Silver Age]] period. Andreyev's style combines elements of [[Literary realism|realist]], [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalist]], and [[Russian symbolism|symbolist]] schools in literature. Of his 25 plays, his 1915 play ''[[He Who Gets Slapped]]'' is regarded as his finest achievement.<ref>{{cite work|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/10.3366/j.ctt1bh2kpq.12.pdf|title=A Slap in the Face of American Taste: Transporting He Who Gets Slapped to American Audiences|work=Border Crossing: Russian Literature into Film|editor=Alexander Burry and Frederick H.

==Biography==
Born in [[Oryol]], Russia within a middle-class family,  Andreyev originally studied law in [[Moscow]] and in [[Saint Petersburg]]. His mother hailed from an old [[Poles|Polish]] aristocratic, though impoverished, family,<ref>James B. Woodward, ''Leonid Andreyev: a study'', Clarendon P. (1969), p. 3</ref><ref>Leo Hamalian & Vera Von Wiren-Garczynski, ''Seven Russian Short Novel Masterpieces'', Popular Library (1967), p. 381</ref> while she also claimed [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] and [[Finns|Finnish]] ancestry.<ref>Frederick H. White, ''Degeneration, Decadence and Disease in the Russian fin de siècle: Neurasthenia in the life and work of Leonid Andreev'', Oxford University Press (2015), p. 47</ref> He became police-court reporter for a Moscow daily, performing the routine of his humble calling without attracting any particular attention. At this time he wrote poetry and made a few efforts to publish it but was refused by most publishers. In 1898 his first short story, "Bargamot and Garaska" ("Баргамот и Гараська"), was published in the "Kurier" newspaper in Moscow. This story came to the attention of [[Maxim Gorky]] who recommended that Andreyev concentrate on his literary work. Andreyev eventually gave up his law practice, fast becoming a literary celebrity, and the two writers remained friends for many years to come. Through Gorky, Andreyev became a member of the Moscow [[Sreda (literary group)|Sreda]] literary group, and published many of his works in Gorky's [[Znanie (publishing company)|Znanie]] collections.<ref>A Writer Remembers by Nikolay Teleshov, Hutchinson, NY, 1943.</ref>

Andreyev's first collection of short stories and short novels (''повести'') appeared in 1901, quickly selling a quarter-million copies and making him a literary star in Russia. In 1901 he published "Стена" ("The Wall"), and in 1902, "В тумане" ("In the Fog") and "Бездна" ("The Abyss,") which was a response to "The Kreutzer Sonata" by Leo Tolstoy. These last two stories caused great commotion because of their candid and audacious treatment of sex.  From 1898-1905 Andreyev published numerous short stories on many subjects, including life in Russian provincial settings, court and prison incidents (where he drew on material from his professional life), and medical settings. His particular interest in psychology and psychiatry gave him an opportunity to explore insights into the human psyche and to depict memorable personalities who later became classic characters of Russian literature ("Thought," 1902).

During the time of the [[1905 Russian Revolution|first Russian revolution]] Andreyev participated actively in the social and political debate as a defender of democratic ideals. Several of his stories, including "The Red Laugh" ("Красный  смех", 1904), ''Governor'' ("Губернатор", 1905) and ''[[The Seven Who Were Hanged]]'' ("Рассказ о семи повешенных", 1908), captured the spirit of this period. Starting from 1905 he also produced many theater dramas including ''[[The Life of Man]]'' (1906), ''[[Tsar Hunger]]'' (1907), ''Black Masks'' (1908), ''Anathema'' (1909), and ''The Days of Our Life'' (1909).<ref>Banham (1998, 24)</ref> ''The Life of Man'' was staged by both [[Konstantin Stanislavsky]] (with his [[Moscow Art Theatre]]) and [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]] (in Saint Petersburg), the two main highlights of Russian theatre of the twentieth century, in 1907.<ref>Benedetti (1999, 176–177), Banham (1998, 24), and Carnicke (2000, 34).</ref>

Andreyev's works of the post-1905 revolution period often represent the evocation of absolute pessimism and a despairing mood. By the beginning of the second decade of the century he began losing fame as new literary powers such as the [[Russian futurism|Futurists]] were fast arising.

Andreyev's most well known work, the play ''[[He Who Gets Slapped]]'', was completed in August 1915, just two months before its world premiere at the [[Moscow Art Theatre]] on 27 October 1915.<ref name="Russian">{{cite work|author=Андреев Л.Н.|title=Собрание сочинений в шести томах|volume=5|work=М.: Художественная литература|year=1995}}</ref> A critically successful Broadway production, using an English language translation of the original Russian by Gregory Zilboorg, was staged in 1922.<ref name="JSTOR">{{cite work|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/10.3366/j.ctt1bh2kpq.12.pdf|title=A Slap in the Face of American Taste: Transporting He Who Gets Slapped to American Audiences|work=Border Crossing: Russian Literature into Film|editor=Alexander Burry and Frederick H. White|author=Frederick H. White|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2016}}</ref> The work has been adapted into several films, a novel, an opera, and a musical, and is his most performed play internationally.<ref name="JSTOR"/>

Aside from his political writings, Andreyev published little after 1915. In 1916, he became the editor of the literary section of the newspaper "Russian Will." He later supported the February Revolution, but foresaw the Bolsheviks' coming to power as catastrophic. In 1917, he moved to Finland. From his house in [[Finland]] he addressed manifestos to the world at large against the excesses of the [[Bolshevik]]s. Idealist and rebel, Andreyev spent his last years in bitter poverty, and his premature death from heart failure may have been hastened by his anguish over the results of the Bolshevik Revolution. His last novel, ''Satan's Diary'', was finished a few days before his death.<ref>Herman Bernstein, preface to ''Satan’s Diary'', Boni and Liveright (1920), p. v</ref>

A play, ''The Sorrows of Belgium'', was written at the beginning of the War to celebrate the heroism of the Belgians against the invading German army. It was produced in the [[United States]], as were the plays, ''The Life of Man'' (1917), ''[[The Rape of the Sabine Women (play)|The Rape of the Sabine Women]]'' (1922), ''He Who Gets Slapped'' (1922), and ''Anathema'' (1923). A popular and acclaimed film version of ''[[He Who Gets Slapped]]'' was produced by [[MGM]] Studios in 1924. Some of his works were translated into English by [[Thomas Seltzer (translator)|Thomas Seltzer]].

''[[Poor Murderer]]'', an adaptation of his short story ''Thought'' made by [[Pavel Kohout]], opened on Broadway in 1976.

He was married to Alexandra Veligorskaia, a niece of [[Taras Shevchenko]]. She died of puerperal fever in 1906. They had two sons, [[Daniil Andreyev]], a poet and mystic, author of ''[[Roza Mira]]'', and Vadim Andreyev. In 1908 Leonid Andreyev married Anna Denisevich, and decided to separate his two little boys, keeping the elder son, Vadim, with him and sending Daniil to live with Aleksandra's sister. Vadim Andreyev became a poet. He lived in Paris.

==Publication in English==

During the 1914-1929 period America was avid for anything relating to Edgar Allan Poe and, as Poe's Russian equivalent, translations of Andreyev's work found a ready audience in the English-speaking world. His work was extensively translated in book form, for instance as ''The Crushed Flower, and other stories'' (1916); ''The Little Angel, and other stories'' (1916); ''When The King Loses His Head, and other stories'' (1920).  His stories were also published in translation in ''Weird Tales'' magazine in the 1920s, such as "Lazarus" in the March 1927 edition.

Leonid Andreyev's granddaughter, daughter of Vadim Andreyev, the American writer and poet Olga Andrejew Carlisle (born 1931), published a collection of his short stories, ''Visions'', in 1987.

==Influence==

Often referred to as 'a Russian Edgar Allan Poe', Andreyev had an influence through translations on two of the great horror writers, H.P. Lovecraft and R.E. Howard. Copies of his ''The Seven Who Were Hanged'' and ''The Red Laugh'' were found in the library of horror writer [[H. P. Lovecraft]] at his death, as listed in the "Lovecraft's Library" catalogue by [[S.T. Joshi]].  Andreyev was also one of the seven "most powerful" writers of all time, in the opinion of [[Robert E. Howard]].<ref>Robert E. Howard, letter to Tevis Clyde Smith, circa 20 February 1928. Given in: Burke, Rusty (1998), "The Robert E. Howard Bookshelf", The Robert E. Howard United Press Association.</ref>
