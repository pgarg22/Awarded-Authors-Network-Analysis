==Collections==
===''After a Life in the Provinces''===
The poems in Locke's first book of poems are dominated by personal and family concerns (for example, in ''Child of Mine'', ''Poem for Barry at the Age of Two'' and ''Surrogate Lover''). This may be compared with the more mature eponymous poem ''After a Life in the Provinces'' where Locke interweaves his past, his religious concerns, his relationship with his wife and his domestic setting with reflections on poetry: ''Unless presently engaged/ poetry must endless grope/towards a past/immediately felt./One perception must lead to another./In that must/is dust transfigured''. That poem quotes [[Walt Whitman]] from ''[[Song of Myself]]'': ''Having pried through the strata, analysed to a hair,/ counsel'd with doctors and calculated close,/I find no sweeter fat than sticks to my own bones''. Locke replies: ''It's that easy, eh?''.<ref name="provinces"/>

Locke's religious concerns are given more pointed treatment in ''Church Universal''. Another reflection in a  domestic setting is in the poem ''Morning: Grapefruit'', Many of the poems have specific New Zealand settings familiar to the poet such as ''Near the Waiohini River Bridge It Happens'' and ''Mangaweka''. The poem ''Demonstration'' concerns the [[1981 South Africa rugby union tour of New Zealand|Saturday, 5 September 1981 Auckland riot during the Sprinboks tour]] which occurred in the area around [[Eden Park|Eden Park, Auckland]]. The poem ''Reply to Baxter'' is an attack on some of the social views of [[James K Baxter]] expressed in his poem ''Pig Island Letters (2)''.<ref name="review"/><ref name="provinces"/>

===''Home Territory''===
Locke's second book of poems contains two named poems ''The Motel'' (4 parts) and the much longer ''Home Territory'' (45 parts). Both poems are largely dominated by family concerns, particularly Locke's relationship with his wife, her pregnancy and the eventual birth of their daughter.<ref>Terry Locke, ''Home Territory'', Lindon Publishing, Auckland West, 1984.<!--ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed--></ref>

===''Maketu''===
Locke's third book of poems is an extended sequence concerning [[Phillip Tapsell]] (also known as "Philip Tapsell"), a figure from early Nineteenth-century New Zealand history "at once romantic, tantalizingly inaccessible and significant"<ref name="Maketu">Terry Locke, ''Maketu'', [[HeadworX]], Wellington, 2003, pp. 9–11.</ref> The poems are a record of the process of finding out about Tapsell (speaking with descendants and others, reading documents and their "academic interpretations" and writing letters) and a reconstruction of the life of Tapsell and Hineiturama, [[Rangatira|Chieftainess]] of [[Te Arawa]], who became his wife in 1833.<ref name="Maketu"/> The poems are in a variety of styles. Unifying them all is the image of the diving board as metaphor for the invitation to historical engagement.<ref name="Maketu"/>

The poems refer particularly to the [[Boyd massacre]] of 1809. Tapsell was involved in the retribution against the [[Iwi|Māori iwi]] concerned, Nga Puhi, giving rise to the main poems ''The Ballad of the good ship Boyd'', ''The Retribution'' and ''The Shadow'', a description of, and reflection on, Tapsell's first marriage, to Maria Ringa, a [[Nga Puhi]] woman ([[Thomas Kendall]] married them – but she left Tapsell soon after) and his second marriage, to another Nga Puhi woman, solemnised by [[Samuel Marsden]], which also ended quickly, with her death.<ref name="Maketu"/> The later experience of Tapsell and Hineiturama (who were formally married by [[Jean Baptiste Pompallier|Bishop Pompallier]] in 1841) is referred to in the poems ''The Revenger's tragedy'' and ''The artefact''.{{fact|date=August 2020}}

The sequence is referenced to the moment and place ([[Maketu]]) where Locke first heard of Tapsell: "The day was fine. The [[Kaituna River]] eddied quietly seawards. The old diving board was still. Near the memorial was an old cannon, and attached to the cannon's base was a plaque bearing the name, Philip Tapsell"<ref name="Maketu"/> (hence the poems carrying the unifying themes ''The cannon'', and especially, ''The diving board''). The poems are rich with references as diverse as [[William Shakespeare]], [[St Januarius]], [[Copernicus]] and [[Pocahontas]].<ref name="Maketu"/>
