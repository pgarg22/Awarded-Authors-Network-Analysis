'''Xenokleides''' was an Athenian poet of the 4th century BC. None of his works have survived. He was one of the [[hetaera]] [[Neaira (hetaera)|Neaira]]'s lovers.<ref>Demosthenes 59.26</ref> According to [[Apollodorus of Acharnae]], 369 BC, he spoke out against [[Callistratus of Aphidnae|Callistratus]]'s request to support [[Sparta]] over [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]].<ref name=D59.27>Demosthenes 59.27</ref> He was prosecuted for avoiding military service, though as a tax-collector for the year he was exempt from military duties, convicted, and [[atimia|disenfranchised]] ([[Ancient Greek]]: ἀτιμία, ''atimia'').  This prosecution, brought by one Stephanos on behalf of Callistratus, was probably intended to remove Xenokleides as a political opponent.<ref>Kapparis, ''Apollodoros: "Against Neaira" [D.59]'', p.222</ref> In 343, Xenokleides was living in Macedonia, and was banished by [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]];<ref>Demosthenes 19.331</ref> he appears to have been once again living in Athens by the time the speech ''[[Against Neaira]]'' was delivered.<ref>Carey, ''Trials from Classical Athens'' p.181</ref>
