'''Elaine Morgan''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]], [[FRSL]] (7 November 1920 – 12 July 2013),<ref name="Millam2013">{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jul/29/elaine-morgan |author=Erika Lorraine Milam |title=Elaine Morgan obituary |work=The Guardian |access-date=21 January 2020}}</ref> was a Welsh writer for television and the author of several books on [[evolutionary anthropology]], especially the [[aquatic ape hypothesis]], which she advocated as a corrective to what she saw as theories that purveyed gendered stereotypes and so failed to take adequate account of women's role in [[human evolution]]. ''[[The Descent of Woman]]'', published in 1972, became an international bestseller, translated into ten languages. In 2016, she was named as one of "the 50 greatest Welsh men and women of all time" in a press survey.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The 50 Greatest Welsh Men and Women of All Time |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/50-greatest-welsh-men-women-11431779 |publisher=Wales Online}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Elaine Floyd was born and brought up in [[Hopkinstown]], near [[Pontypridd]], in [[Wales]]. She lived for many years until her death, in [[Mountain Ash, Rhondda Cynon Taff|Mountain Ash]], near [[Aberdare]]. She graduated from [[Lady Margaret Hall]], [[Oxford University|Oxford]], with a degree in English. She married Morien Morgan, a veteran of the Spanish Civil War,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/recalling-heroic-welsh-volunteers-who-15525202 |title=A Welsh heroes who fought Spanish Civil War fascism |first=Carolyn |last=Hitt |date=8 December 2018 |website=WalesOnline}}</ref> (died 1997) and had three sons, her eldest being [[Dylan Morgan]].<ref name=Fishlock/>

==Writing==
Elaine Morgan began writing in the 1950s after winning a competition in the ''[[New Statesman]]'', successfully publishing, then joining the [[BBC]] when it began to produce her plays for television.<ref name="Academi"/> Her works included popular dramas, newspaper columns, and a series of publications on [[evolutionary anthropology]].<ref name="Millam2013"/> Her first book, ''The Descent of Woman'', published in 1972, became an international bestseller translated into ten languages. The book drew attention to what she saw as [[sexism]] inherent in the prevalent savannah-based "[[Killer ape theory|killer ape]]" theories of human evolution as presented in popular anthropological works by [[Robert Ardrey]], [[Lionel Tiger]] and others. She argued that such "[[Tarzan]]ist" anthropological narratives purveyed gendered stereotypes of women that failed to take adequate account of women's role in human evolution. ''The Aquatic Ape'' (1982), ''The Scars of Evolution'' (1990), ''The Descent of the Child'' (1994), ''The Aquatic Ape Hypothesis'' (1997) and ''The Naked Darwinist'' (2008) all explored her alternative account of human evolution in more detail.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Milam|first=Erika Lorraine |title=Creatures of Cain: The Hunt for Human Nature in Cold War America |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=2019 |pages=153–167 |isbn=9780691181882}}</ref>

She also published ''Falling Apart: the Rise and Decline of Urban Civilization'' in 1976, and in 2005 ''Pinker's List'', a critique of [[Steven Pinker]]'s ''[[The Blank Slate]]''.

Morgan wrote for many television series, including the adaptations of ''[[How Green Was My Valley (TV drama serial)|How Green Was My Valley]]'' (1975), ''[[Off to Philadelphia in the Morning (TV series)|Off to Philadelphia in the Morning]]'' (1978) and ''[[Testament of Youth]]'' (1979). Her other work included episodes of ''[[Dr. Finlay's Casebook]]'' (1963–1970), the biographical drama ''[[The Life and Times of David Lloyd George]]'' (1981) and contributions to the ''[[Campion (1989 TV series)|Campion]]'' (1989) series.

She won two [[BAFTA]]s and two [[Writers' Guild of Great Britain|Writers' Guild]] awards. She also wrote the script for the ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'' documentary about the disabled fund-raiser [[Joey Deacon]], winning the [[Prix Italia]] in 1975. She was honoured with the Writer of the Year Award from the [[Royal Television Society]] for her serialisation of [[Vera Brittain]]'s ''[[Testament of Youth (TV series)|Testament of Youth]]'' (1979).<ref name=Hitt2019>{{Cite news |last1=Hitt |first1=Carolyn |title=Hidden Heroines: Could Elaine Morgan win statue vote? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-46508395 |access-date=26 November 2020 |work=BBC News |date=10 January 2019}}</ref>

[[File:AAT Confer 3.jpg|The Delegates of the Aquatic Ape Symposium 1987. Morgan is to the right of Machteld (Maggie) Roede, a conference organiser who is at the front.|thumb]]
Morgan has promoted a version of the [[aquatic ape hypothesis]], which proposes that human evolution had an "aquatic phase" in the [[Miocene]] or [[Pliocene]] epoch.<ref name=foley>{{Cite journal |authors=Foley R, Lahr MM |year=2014 |title=The role of 'the aquatic' in human evolution: Constraining the aquatic ape hypothesis |journal=Evol.

Although Morgan's promotion of the aquatic ape hypothesis is still generally ignored by anthropologists and criticized by some in the scientific community,<ref name=Langdon>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1006/jhev.1997.0146 |pmid=9361254 |year=1997 |last1=Langdon |first1=J. |title=Umbrella hypotheses and parsimony in human evolution: a critique of the Aquatic Ape Hypothesis |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=479–494 |journal=Journal of Human Evolution}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=McNeill |first=D |year=2000 |title=The Face: A Natural History |pages=[https://archive.org/details/face00dani/page/36 36–37] |isbn=0-316-58812-1 |publisher=Back Bay}}</ref><ref name=Graham2008>{{Cite book |isbn=978-3-540-69930-9 |title=Pediatric ENT |last=Graham |first=JM |author2=Scadding GK |author3=Bull PD |year=2008 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=laEQt_Vp3ngC&pg=PA27 27]}}</ref> it has achieved popular appeal since the publication of ''Descent of Woman'' in 1972,<ref>{{Cite journal |journal=Western Mail |date=12 July 2013 |title=Columnist Elaine Morgan dies at the age of 92 |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/western-mail-columnist-feminist-author-5075054 |access-date=20 July 2013}}</ref><ref name="hold">{{Cite journal |authors=Rae TC, Koppe T |year=2014 |title=Sinuses and flotation: Does the aquatic ape theory hold water? |journal=Evol.

Morgan's work has received warm comments from several prominent people. Philosopher [[Daniel C Dennett|Daniel Dennett]] wrote of the criticisms of her:

{{Blockquote|text=Many of the counterarguments seem awfully thin and ad hoc. During the last few years when I have found myself in the company of distinguished biologists, evolutionary theorists, paleo-anthropologists, and other experts, I have often asked them just to tell me, please, exactly why Morgan must be wrong about the aquatic ape theory. I haven't yet had a reply worth mentioning, aside from those who admit, with a twinkle in their eyes, that they have often wondered the same thing.<ref name=Dennett1995>{{Cite book |isbn=9780140167344 |title=Darwin's Dangerous Idea |last=Dennett |first=Daniel C. |year=1995 |publisher=[[Penguin Group|Penguin]] |pages=6368 [https://www.google.com.au/books/edition/Darwin_s_Dangerous_Idea/bn-isXoTZmUC?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover]}}</ref>}}

And in a BBC/Discovery Channel Documentary, the famous South African anthropologist [[Phillip V. Tobias]] said:

{{Blockquote|text=I see Elaine Morgan, through her series of superbly written books, presenting a challenge to the scientists to take an interest in this thing, to look at the evidence dispassionately. Not to avert your gaze as though it were something you that you hadn't ought to hear about or hadn't ought to see. And those that are honest with themselves are going to dispassionately examine the evidence. We've got to if we are going to be true to our calling as scientists.<ref>{{Cite AV media |people=Mann, Moira (Producer) |date=November 1998 |title=Aquatic Ape |medium=Documentary |location=Bristol |publisher=BBC / Discovery Channel}}</ref>}}

In 2000 Morgan was awarded the Letten F Saugstad prize in Oslo for her "contribution to scientific knowledge" and in December 2008 she was admitted as a Fellow of the [[Linnean Society of London|Linnean Society]], following in the footsteps of Charles Darwin and Alfred Russell Wallace.<ref name=Kuliukas2020>{{Cite book |title=Elaine Morgan ~ 100 Years Towards Origins |last=Kuliukas |first=Algis V. |year=2020 |publisher=[Amazon Kindle] |pages=[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08MB9LMJ4]}}</ref>

==Death and legacy==
Morgan died at the age of 92 on 12 July 2013. Welsh author [[Trevor Fishlock]] described her in an obituary as a writer "who brought out the flavour of Wales."<ref name=Fishlock>{{Cite web |title=A writer who brought out the flavour of Wales |url=http://www.iwa.wales/click/2013/07/a-writer-who-brought-out-the-flavour-of-wales/ |first=Trevor |last=Fishlock |access-date=7 November 2016}}</ref>

In 2019, Morgan was one of five women on a shortlist for a Cardiff statue.<ref name=Hitt2019 />

In 2020, to commemorate the centenary of her birth, two complimentary biographies of her life were published. The Welsh historian Daryl Leeworthy wrote one focusing on her earlier career as a writer<ref name=Leeworthy2020>{{Cite book |title=Elaine Morgan A Life Behind the Screen |last=Leeworthy |first=Daryl |year=2020 |publisher=[[Seren Books]] |pages=220 [https://www.serenbooks.com/productdisplay/elaine-morgan-life-behind-screen]}}</ref> and Algis Kuliukas wrote one emphasizing more her "aquatic ape" work.<ref name=Kuliukas2020/>
