'''Steven Erikson''' (born October 7, 1959) is the pseudonym of '''Steve Rune Lundin''', a Canadian [[author|novelist]], who was educated and trained as both an [[archaeologist]] and [[anthropologist]].

He is best known for his ten-volume spanning epic fantasy series ''[[Malazan Book of the Fallen]]'', which began with the publication of ''[[Gardens of the Moon]]'' (1999) and was completed with the publication of ''[[The Crippled God (Malazan)|The Crippled God]]'' (2011). By 2012 over 1 million copies of the series had been sold worldwide,<ref>Per the cover copy of the paperback edition of ''The Crippled God.''</ref> and over 3 million copies by 2018. ''[[SF Site]]'' has called the series "the most significant work of epic fantasy since Donaldson's Chronicles of [[Thomas Covenant]],"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfsite.com/08b/mt182.htm|title=The SF Site Featured Review: Midnight Tides|last=Thompson|first=William|year=2004|publisher=The SF Site|access-date=2009-02-22}}</ref> and ''Fantasy Book Review'' described it as "the best fantasy series of recent times."<ref>{{cite web |title=House of Chains by Steven Erikson |url=http://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Steven-Erikson/House-Of-Chains.html |year=2008 |work=Fantasy Book Review |publisher= Fantasybookreview.com |access-date=August 10, 2009}}</ref> Fellow author [[Glen Cook]] has called the series a masterwork, while [[Stephen R. Donaldson]] has praised him for his approach to the fantasy genre and has compared him to the likes of [[Joseph Conrad]], [[Henry James]], [[William Faulkner]], and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]].

Set in the Malazan world, Erikson has written a prequel trilogy, ''[[The Kharkanas Trilogy]]'', seven novellas, a short story, and is currently working on a sequel trilogy, ''The Witness Trilogy'', the first book of which, titled ''The God is Not Willing'', was published in 2021.

His foray into [[science fiction]] has produced a comedic trilogy, the ''Willful Child Trilogy'', a spoof on ''[[Star Trek]]'' and other tropes common in the genre, and a [[First contact (science fiction)|First Contact]] novel titled ''Rejoice, a Knife To the Heart'', published in 2018.

==Life and career==
Steven Erikson was born in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], and grew up in [[Winnipeg]].<ref name="FBR_bio">{{cite web |title= Steven Erikson biography|url= http://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Steven-Erikson/biography.html|work=Fantasy Book Review |publisher= Fantasybookreview.com|access-date=August 10, 2009}}</ref> He subsequently lived in the UK with his wife and son, but has since returned to Canada.<ref name="FBR_bio"/> He is an anthropologist and archaeologist by training and is a graduate of the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]].<ref name="meetse">{{cite web |title=Steven Erikson |url=http://us.macmillan.com/author/stevenerikson |year=2008 |publisher= Macmillan|access-date=July 11, 2009}}</ref> For his thesis at the Iowa Writers' Workshop, Erikson wrote a "story cycle" of short stories titled ''A Ruin of Feathers'' about an archaeologist in Central America. Subsequently, he received a grant to finish the work which was published by TSAR, a small Canadian publishing house. For his next work he co-won the Anvil Press International 3-Day Novel Contest for which he signed away the rights, a mistake he attributes to inexperience. Erikson's third book was also published by TSAR, and consisted of a novella and short stories titled ''Revolvo and other Canadian Tales''. Later, upon moving to England, he sold what he refers to as his "first real novel" to Hodder and Stoughton — ''[[This River Awakens]]'' — written when he still lived in Winnipeg. Before assuming the pseudonym Erikson (as an homage to his mother's maiden name), he published his first four books, currently out of print, under his real name.<ref>{{cite web |title=Steven Erikson Facebook post November 25, 2020 |url=https://www.facebook.com/steveneriksonofficial/posts/1742077502611209

==Themes==
Erikson has stated that apart from examining the "human condition", all his literary work share "compassion" as a theme, or main driving force.<ref name="FHive">{{cite web|url=https://fantasy-hive.co.uk/2018/11/interview-with-steven-erikson/|title=INTERVIEW WITH STEVEN ERIKSON|last=Thornton|first=Jonathan|date=1 November 2018|work=Fantasy Hive|access-date=1 November 2018}}</ref>
Furthermore, when envisioning the Malazan world, both Esslemont and he agreed to create societies and cultures that never knew sexism and gender based hierarchies of power.<ref name="Lunna">{{cite episode | title = Steven Erikson - Le livre des martyrs : Volume 1, Les jardins de la lune | url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PglugQjKsi0 | series =Mollat | minutes =2:40}}</ref>

==Style==
Erikson has stated explicitly that he enjoys playing with and overturning the conventions of fantasy, presenting characters that violate the stereotypes associated with their roles. They embody the multidimensional characteristics found in human beings, making them more realistic and giving the story more depth, which is why his books are anything but predictable. He deliberately began ''Gardens of the Moon'' mid-plot rather than beginning with a more conventional narrative.<ref name="sffw-interview">{{cite web |title=Interview with Steven Erikson |url=http://www.sffworld.com/2006/01/scifiint_165/? |date=January 21, 2006 |publisher=SFFWorld.com |access-date=July 11, 2009}}</ref><ref name=spot1>{{cite web |title=On the spot at Bookspotcentral: Interview with Steven Erikson |url=http://www.bscreview.com/2008/06/on-the-spot-at-bookspotcentral-interview-steven-erikson |publisher= bookspotcentral.com|access-date=July 11, 2009}}</ref> The writer's style of writing includes complex plots with masses of characters. In addition, he has been praised for his willingness to kill central characters when it enhances the plot.<ref name="FBR_bio"/>

The first novel of the ''[[Malazan Book of the Fallen]]'' series, ''[[Gardens of the Moon]]'' (1999), was well received. It was short-listed for a [[World Fantasy Award]].<ref name="transworld">{{cite web |title=Steven Erikson |url=http://www.booksattransworld.co.uk/stevenerikson/home.htm |publisher=booksattransworld |access-date=11 July 2009}}</ref> It has also earned Erikson the reputation as one of the best authors in the fantasy genre,<ref name="transworld"/> and was described as "An astounding début".<ref name="twbooks" >{{cite web |title=Steven Erikson |url=http://www.twbooks.co.uk/authors/stevenerikson.html |access-date=11 July 2009}}</ref> The novel was acclaimed for its "combination of originality and intelligent, strong and exciting storytelling".<ref name="transworld" /> The second book in the series, ''[[Deadhouse Gates]]'' (2000), was voted one of the ten best fantasy novels of 2000 by ''SF Site''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sfsite.com/columns/best01.htm | title = Top ten books of 2000 | publisher = [[SF Site]] }}</ref>

Fellow author [[Glen Cook]] has called the series a masterwork of the imagination that may be the high water mark of the epic fantasy genre. In his treatise written for ''[[The New York Review of Science Fiction]]'', fellow author [[Stephen R. Donaldson]] has also praised Erikson for his approach to the fantasy genre, the subversion of classical tropes, the complex characterizations, the social commentary — pointing explicitly to parallels between the fictional Letheras Economy and the US Economy — and has referred to him as "an extraordinary writer", comparing him to the likes of [[Joseph Conrad]], [[Henry James]], [[William Faulkner]], and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]].<ref name="twbooks"/><ref name=Author1>{{cite web|last1=Donaldson|first1=Stephen R.|url=http://www.nyrsf.com/2015/03/fantasy-is-the-most-intelligent-precise-and-accurate-means-of-arriving-at-the-truth-s-p.html|title=Stephen R.

==Influences==
Erikson attributes paper and pen Role-Playing games, specifically AD&D and GURPS, as being the biggest influence in his writing career, and even calls it the fundament of the Malazan Empire, from his ''[[Malazan Book of the Fallen]]'' series, is based on. [[Stephen R. Donaldson|Stephen R. Donaldson's]], [[The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant]] and [[Glen Cook|Glen Cook's]] [[The Black Company]], both ushering post-Tolkien style of writing, are among some of the works that have influenced his storytelling. He also credits the works of [[Robert E. Howard]], [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], [[Homer]], [[Arthur C. Clarke]], [[Roger Zelazny]], [[John Gardner (American writer)|John Gardner]], [[Gustav Hasford]], [[Mark Helprin]] and [[Robin Hobb]] as some of the influences he used in the Malazan works.<ref name="Erikson">{{cite web |last=Erikson |first=Steven|title=The World of the Malazan Empire and Role-Playing Games |url=http://www.steven-erikson.com/index.php/the-world-of-the-malazan-empire-and-role-playing-games/ |access-date=October 23, 2018}}</ref><ref name="FBR_bio"/>
