'''Georg Trakl''' (3 February 1887 – 3 November 1914) was an [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian]] poet and the brother of the pianist [[Grete Trakl]]. He is considered one of the most important Austrian [[Expressionism|Expressionists]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/?id=19&autor=Trakl,%20%20Georg&autor_vorname=%20Georg&autor_nachname=Trakl |title=Georg Trakl |language=de |work=[[Project Gutenberg]] |publisher=Spiegel Online |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503024322/http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/?id=19&autor=Trakl,%20%20Georg&autor_vorname=%20Georg&autor_nachname=Trakl |archive-date=3 May 2010}}</ref> He is perhaps best known for his poem "[[Grodek]]", which he wrote shortly before he died of a [[cocaine]] [[drug overdose|overdose]].

==Life and work==
Trakl was born and lived the first 21 years of his life in [[Salzburg]]. His father, Tobias Trakl (11 June 1837, Ödenburg/[[Sopron]]&nbsp;– 1910),<ref>Hardware dealer Tobias Trakl from [[Kingdom of Hungary|West Hungary]] relocated to [[Wiener Neustadt]] for professional reasons. [http://www.gedichte.xbib.de/biographie_Trakl.htm], {{cite web|url=http://www.elib.at/www/wiki/index.php/Georg_Trakl|title=Archived copy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090516115335/http://elib.at/www/wiki/index.php/Georg_Trakl|archive-date=16 May 2009|url-status=dead|access-date=2009-05-31}}, [http://www.hausarbeiten.de/faecher/vorschau/102499.html], [http://www.zeit.de/1995/04/Wenn_einem_die_Welt_entzweibricht]</ref> was a dealer of hardware from [[Hungary]], while his mother, Maria Catharina Halik (17 May 1852, [[Wiener Neustadt]]&nbsp;– 1925), was a housewife of partly [[Czech (people)|Czech]] descent; she was a drug-addict and left the education to a French "gouvernante", who brought Trakl into contact with French language and literature at an early age. His sister [[Grete Trakl]] was a musical prodigy; with her he shared artistic endeavors.  Poems allude to an incestuous relationship between the two.<ref>Marty Bax: ''Immer zu wenig Liebe. Grete Trakl. Ihr feinster Kuppler. Ihre Familie.'' Amsterdam 2014, E-Book {{cite web |url=http://dx.nu/Trakl/100 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-11-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20141115132207/http://dx.nu/Trakl/100 |archive-date=15 November 2014}}.</ref>

Trakl attended a [[Catholic]] elementary school, although his parents were [[Protestant]]s. He matriculated in 1897 at the Salzburg Staatsgymnasium, where he had problems in [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], and mathematics, for which he had to repeat one year and then leave without [[Matura]]. At age 13, Trakl began to write poetry.

After quitting high school, Trakl worked for a pharmacist for three years and decided to adopt pharmacy as a career; this facilitated access to drugs, such as morphine and cocaine. It was during this time that he experimented with [[playwriting]], but his two short plays, ''All Souls' Day'' and ''Fata Morgana'', were not successful. However, from May to December 1906, Trakl published four prose pieces in the feuilleton section of two Salzburg newspapers. All cover themes and settings found in his mature work. This is especially true of "Traumland" (Dreamland), in which a young man falls in love with a dying girl who is his cousin.<ref>Sieglinde Klettenhammer, ''Georg Trakl in Zeitungen und Zeitschriften seiner Zeit: Kontext und Rezeption'' (Vienna: Inst. für Germanistik, 1990).</ref>

In 1908, Trakl moved to [[Vienna, Austria|Vienna]] to study pharmacy, and became acquainted with some local artists who helped him publish some of his poems. Trakl's father died in 1910, soon before Trakl received his pharmacy certificate; thereafter, Trakl enlisted in the army for a year-long stint. His return to civilian life in Salzburg was unsuccessful and he re-enlisted, serving as a pharmacist at a hospital in [[Innsbruck, Austria|Innsbruck]]. There he became acquainted with a group of avant-garde artists involved with the well-regarded literary journal ''Der Brenner'', a journal that began the Kierkegaard revival in the German-speaking countries. [[Ludwig von Ficker]], the editor of the journal ''Der Brenner'' (and son of the historian [[Julius von Ficker]]), became his patron: he regularly printed Trakl's work and endeavored to find him a publisher to produce a collection of poems. The result of these efforts was ''Gedichte'' ''(Poems)'', published by Kurt Wolff in [[Leipzig]] during the summer of 1913. Ficker also brought Trakl to the attention of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], who anonymously provided him with a sizable stipend so that he could concentrate on his writing.

At the beginning of [[World War I]], Trakl served in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] and was sent as a [[Physician|medical officer]] to attend soldiers on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]]. Trakl suffered frequent bouts of depression. On one such occasion during the [[Battle of Gródek (1914)|Battle of Gródek]] (fought in autumn 1914 at [[Horodok, Lviv Oblast|Gródek]], then in the [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]]), Trakl had to steward the recovery of some ninety soldiers wounded in the fierce campaign against the Russians. He tried to shoot himself from the strain, but his comrades prevented him. Hospitalized at a military hospital in [[Kraków]] and observed closely, Trakl lapsed into worse depression and wrote to Ficker for advice. Ficker convinced him to communicate with Wittgenstein. Upon receiving Trakl's note, Wittgenstein travelled to the hospital, but found that Trakl had died of a cocaine overdose.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/4956922/Georg-Trakl-Twenty-Poems|title=Georg Trakl: Twenty Poems|author=James Wright and Robert Bly|via=Scribd|date=22 August 2008|access-date=22 April 2009}}</ref> Trakl was buried at Kraków's [[Rakowicki Cemetery]] on 6 November 1914, but on 7 October 1925, as a result of the efforts by Ficker, his remains were transferred to the municipal cemetery of [[Innsbruck]]-[[Mühlau (Innsbruck)|Mühlau]] (where they now repose next to Ficker's).

==Themes and motifs==
While Trakl's very earliest poems are more philosophical and do not deal as much with the real world, most of his poems are either set in the evening or have evening as a motif.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Brown |first=Russell E. |date=January 1969 |title=Time of Day in Early Expressionist Poetry |journal=PMLA |publisher=Modern Language Association |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=20–28 }}</ref> Silence is also a frequent motif in Trakl's poetry, and his later poems often feature the silent dead, who are unable to express themselves.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lyon |first=James K.. |date=Winter 1970 |title=Georg Trakl's Poetry of Silence |journal=Monatshefte |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |volume=62 |issue=4 |pages=340–356 }}</ref>
