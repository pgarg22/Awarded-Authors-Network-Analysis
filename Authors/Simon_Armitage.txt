===Laurel Prize===
{{main|Poetry School#Laurel Prize}}
In November 2019 Armitage announced that he would donate his salary as poet laureate to create a new prize for a collection of poems "with nature and the environment at their heart". The prize is to be run by the [[Poetry School]].<ref name=flood-laurel>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/21/simon-armitage-nature-has-come-back-to-the-centre-of-poetry | work=The Guardian | title = Simon Armitage: 'Nature has come back to the centre of poetry' | last=Flood | first=Alison | date=21 November 2019}}</ref>

===The Laureate's Library Tour===
In November 2019 Armitage announced that each spring for ten years he would spend a week touring five to seven libraries giving a one-hour poetry reading and perhaps introducing a guest poet. The libraries were to be selected in alphabetical order: in March 2020 he was to visit places or libraries with names starting with "A" or "B" (including the [[British Library]]<ref name="tour-bl">{{cite web |title=Simon Armitage: The Laureate's Library Tour: Fri 20 Mar 2020 |url=https://www.bl.uk/events/simon-armitage-the-laureates-library-tour |publisher=British Library |access-date=13 January 2020}}</ref>), and so on until "W", "X", "Y" and "Z" in 2029. He comments: "The letter X will be interesting – does anywhere in the UK begin with X?  I also want to find a way of including alphabet letters from other languages spoken in these islands such as Welsh, Urdu or Chinese, and to involve communities where English might not be the first language."<ref name="tour-bookseller">{{cite news |title=Ten year library tour for Poet Laureate Simon Armitage |url=https://www.thebookseller.com/news/ten-year-library-tour-poet-laureate-simon-armitage-1109486 |access-date=13 January 2020 |work=The Bookseller |date=6 November 2019}}</ref><ref name="tour">{{cite web |title=The Laureate's Library Tour |url=https://www.simonarmitage.com/the-laureates-library-tour/ |publisher=Simon Armitage |access-date=13 January 2020}}</ref>

===Radio and podcasts===
In March 2020 Armitage launched a [[podcast]], ''The Poet Laureate Has Gone To His Shed'', also broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]]. While working on the medieval poem ''[[The Owl and the Nightingale]]'' he invited a series of guests to visit him in his garden writing-shed.

In May 2020 Armitage was the guest on BBC Radio 4's ''[[Desert Island Discs]]''. His choice of music (eight pieces to take to an imaginary desert island) was wide-ranging but the track he would save from a flood was [[David Bowie]]'s "[[Moonage Daydream]]"; his chosen book was the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', and his luxury a [[tennis ball]].<ref name="bbc-desert">{{cite web |title=Desert Island Discs, Simon Armitage, Poet Laureate |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000j120 |publisher=BBC Radio 4 |access-date=17 June 2020}}</ref>

In April 2020, in a short interview on the BBC 6 Music show Guy Garvey's Finest Hour, Armitage chose the track "Stanlow" by [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]], taken from their 1980 album ''[[Organisation (album)|Organisation]]''. The song is a homage to the [[Stanlow Oil Refinery]].<ref name="bbc-6music">{{cite web |title=Guy Garvey's Finest Hour – Comfort To The Nation |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000hml9|publisher=BBC Radio 6 Music |access-date=23 September 2020}}</ref>
