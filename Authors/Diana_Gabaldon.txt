===Novels===
[[File:Diana Gabaldon by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|right|thumb|Gabaldon signing books at the 2017 [[Phoenix Comicon]]]]
In 1988, Gabaldon decided to write a novel for "practice, just to learn how", and with no intention to show it to anyone.<ref name="Gabaldon FAQ Books">{{cite web|url = http://www.dianagabaldon.com/resources/faq/|title = Official site: FAQ - About the Books|publisher = DianaGabaldon.com|access-date = August 20, 2014}}</ref> As a research professor, she decided that a historical novel would be easiest to research and write,<ref name="Gabaldon FAQ Books"/> but she had no background in history and initially no particular time period in mind.<ref name="ADN 2009"/> Gabaldon happened to see a rerun episode of the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' science fiction TV series titled "[[The War Games]]."<ref name="drwho">{{cite web |url=http://www.dianagabaldon.com/2010/05/the-dr-who-connection/ |title=The "Dr. Who" Connection |last1=Gabaldon |first1=Diana |date=May 11, 2010 |publisher=DianaGabaldon.com |access-date=August 20, 2014}}</ref>  One of the Doctor's companions was a Scot from around 1745, a young man about 17 years old named [[Jamie McCrimmon]], who provided the initial inspiration for her main male character, James Fraser, and for her novel's mid-18th century Scotland setting.<ref name="ADN 2009"/><ref name="Gabaldon FAQ Books"/><ref name="drwho" /> Gabaldon decided to have "an Englishwoman to play-off all these kilted Scotsmen," but her female character "took over the story and began telling it herself, making smart-ass modern remarks about everything."<ref name="Gabaldon FAQ Books"/>

To explain the character's modern behavior and attitudes, Gabaldon chose to use [[time travel]].<ref name="Gabaldon FAQ Books"/> Writing the novel at a time "when the World Wide Web didn't exist," she did her research "the old-fashioned way, by herself, through books."<ref name="ADN 2009"/>
Later, Gabaldon posted a short excerpt of her novel on the [[CompuServe]] Literary Forum, where author [[John E. Stith]] introduced her to [[literary agent]] Perry Knowlton.<ref name="Gabaldon FAQ Books"/><ref name="Wirten">{{Cite journal|last=Hemmungs Wirten|first=Eva|title=Global Infatuation: Explorations in Transnational Publishing and Texts. The Case of Harlequin Enterprises and Sweden|publisher=Uppsala University|journal=Section for Sociology of Literature at the Department of Literature, Number 38|format=PDF|url=https://archive.org/details/globalinfatuatio0000hemm/page/56|access-date=November 11, 2013|year=1998|isbn=91-85178-28-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/globalinfatuatio0000hemm/page/56 56]}}</ref> Knowlton represented her based on an unfinished first novel, tentatively titled ''Cross Stitch.'' Her first book deal was for a trilogy, the first novel plus two then-unwritten sequels. Her U.S. publishers changed the first book's title to ''[[Outlander (novel)|Outlander]]'', but the title remained unchanged in the U.K. According to Gabaldon, her British publishers liked the title ''Cross Stitch'', a play on "a stitch in time"; however, the American publisher said it "sounded too much like embroidery" and wanted a more "adventurous" title.<ref name="Gabaldon FAQ Books" /> When her second book was finished, Gabaldon resigned her faculty position at Arizona State University to become a full-time author.<ref name="Montreal Gazette"/>

{{As of|2021}}, the [[Outlander (book series)|''Outlander'' series]] comprises nine published novels. The ninth installment, ''[[Go Tell the Bees That I am Gone]]'', was published on November 23, 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dianagabaldon.com/books/outlander-series/book-nine-outlander-series/|title=Go Tell The Bees That I Am Gone|website=DianaGabaldon.com }}</ref> Gabaldon also published ''The Exile (An Outlander Graphic Novel)'' in 2010. The [[Lord John series|''Lord John'' series]] is a spin-off from the ''Outlander'' books, centering on a secondary character from the original series. Gabaldon announced in September 2021 that she is working on the tenth Outlander series book which is possibly the last.<ref>https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/a37807616/outlander-book-10-diana-gabaldon-release-date-spoilers/</ref>

==Personal life==
Gabaldon lives in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]] with her husband Doug Watkins, with whom she has three adult children.<ref name="Gabaldon FAQ Diana"/><ref name="bio 2013" /> Her son, [[Sam Sykes]], is also a fantasy writer.

Gabaldon is a [[Roman Catholic]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://januarymagazine.com/profiles/gabaldon.html |title=Interview: Diana Gabaldon |first=Linda |last=Richards |journal=January Magazine |date=June 1999 |access-date=November 27, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |quote=...I try to avoid describing myself by any sort of label, so to speak.
