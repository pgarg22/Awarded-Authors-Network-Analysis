Her family wanted her to pursue the violin, like her grandfather, but discovered her love of theatre while in high school after joining the drama club. She would then audition and be accepted to Northwestern University. While there she would make the switch from acting to playwriting.

==Career==
=== Early career ===
Towards the end of her college career, Diamond wrote her first play entitled, "Solitaire" which was awarded the Agnes Nixon Playwriting Award at Northwestern. After graduating from Northwestern with a B.A. in Theatre and Performance studies in 1991, she met John Diamond, who was working on getting his Ph.D. in sociology. They would marry in 1996.

Not long after college she went on to form her own Theatre company called "Another Small Black Theatre Company With Good Things To Say and A lot of Nerve Productions". Using her own company she put up Solitaire and other shows at the since closed 'Cafe Voltaire' in Chicago where her acting and writing career blossomed<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.goodmantheatre.org/artists-archive/creative-partners/playwrights/lydia-r-diamond/|title=Lydia R. Diamond {{!}} Goodman Theatre|website=www.goodmantheatre.org|access-date=2016-11-12}}</ref>

=== Critical years ===
In 2004, Lydia gave birth to her son, Baylor; and John took on a teaching job at Harvard and they relocated to Boston. Diamond, who had made a name for herself in Chicago as a serious playwright, had to restart her career in New England, all while caring for a newborn. “I went from being playwright-about-town and educator to being faculty wife and new mother, without the buffer of my own community and my very close girlfriends.”

Diamond soon started to gain traction in the city, in 2006 The Huntington Theatre chose her for the Playwriting Fellows program. The Boston theatre company, [[Company One]], produced her adaptation of Toni Morrison's [[The Bluest Eye|novel]] “The Bluest Eye”; the story is that of a young black girl longing for blue eyes so that she may be seen by the world around her. Diamond also started teaching at Boston University around this time.

In 2008, [[Company One]] produced her play, "Voyeurs de Venus", which revolves around a young anthropologist who is investigating the life and exploitation of a Saartje Baartman, an African woman paraded through Europe as a sideshow attraction in the 19th century.

From 2011–2012, her play ''[[Stick Fly]]'' played on Broadway, in a production produced by Alicia Keys.

In 2017, her play ''The Bluest Eye'' was produced by the [[Guthrie Theater]] in Minneapolis, MN.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Considine |first1=Basil |title=REVIEW: Splendid Bluest Eye (Guthrie Theater) |url=https://twincitiesarts.com/2017/04/23/review-splendid-bluest-eye-guthrie-theater/ |accessdate=30 November 2018 |publisher=Twin Cities Arts Reader}}</ref>
