'''Libby Houston'''  is an English poet, botanist, and rock climber. The native of [[North London]] has published several collections of poetry. Houston, a research associate at the School of Biological Sciences at the [[University of Bristol]], has discovered several new species of [[whitebeam]] (''[[Sorbus]]''), one of which has been given her name. In addition to membership in several organisations related to [[botany]], Houston is a participant in the Avon Gorge & Downs Wildlife Project. She was the recipient of the [[H. H. Bloomer Award|H. H. Bloomer medal]] in 2012. The award from the [[Linnean Society of London]] acknowledged her contribution to [[natural history]], in particular, the body of knowledge of whitebeams in Britain, and the [[flora]] of [[Avon Gorge]] in Bristol, England. In 2018, she was recipient of the Marsh Botany Award, in recognition of lifetime achievement in the field.<ref name=marsh>{{cite web|url=https://www.marshchristiantrust.org/award/marsh-botany-award/|title=Marsh Botany Award}}</ref>

==Research at the University of Bristol==

Houston assisted Lewis Frost in what was previously known as the Department of Botany at the University of Bristol in his study of the flora of Avon Gorge in Bristol. The research included rare flora such as Spiked Speedwell<ref>{{cite web|title=Spiked Speedwell|url=http://www.luontoportti.com/suomi/en/kukkakasvit/spiked-speedwell|work=luontoportti.com|publisher=NatureGate|access-date=21 August 2012}}</ref> (''[[Veronica spicata]]'') and Bristol Rockcress<ref>{{cite web|title=''Arabis scabra'' All. – Bristol Rock-Cress|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/research/projects/species-dictionary/species/arabis_scabra.html|work=nhm.ac.uk|publisher=Natural History Museum|access-date=21 August 2012}}</ref> (''Arabis scabra''). Her interest in the Avon Gorge flora was enhanced by her rock climbing prowess, which allowed her to study plants inaccessible to others.<ref name=bns/> More recent work has been performed in conjunction with Simon Hiscock, Professor of Botany at the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Bristol, as well as Tim Rich, head of the vascular plant section<ref>{{cite web|title=Tim Rich: Head of Vascular Plant Section|url=http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/cy/172/|work=museumwales.ac.uk|publisher=National Museum Wales|access-date=21 August 2012}}</ref> at the [[National Museum Wales]]. That collaboration has centred on Avon Gorge whitebeams (''Sorbus'').<ref name=bns/>
