[[All Movie Guide]] |work= [[The New York Times]] |author= Jason Buchanan |date= 2014 |url-status= dead }}</ref> is an American film director, screenwriter, and playwright. Born in New York City, Sorkin developed a passion for writing at an early age. His works include the Broadway plays ''[[A Few Good Men (play)|A Few Good Men]]'', ''[[The Farnsworth Invention]]'', and ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird (2018 play)|To Kill a Mockingbird]]'', as well as the television series ''[[Sports Night]]'' (1998–2000), ''[[The West Wing]]'' (1999–2006), ''[[Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip]]'' (2006–07), and ''[[The Newsroom (American TV series)|The Newsroom]]'' (2012–14)''.'' He wrote the film screenplay for the legal drama ''[[A Few Good Men]]'' (1992), the comedy ''[[The American President]]'' (1995), and several [[Biographical film|biopics]] including ''[[Charlie Wilson's War (film)|Charlie Wilson's War]]'' (2007), ''[[Moneyball (film)|Moneyball]]'' (2011), and ''[[Steve Jobs (film)|Steve Jobs]]'' (2015). For writing 2010's ''[[The Social Network]]'', he won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] and [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay|Best Screenplay]].

Sorkin made his feature [[List of directorial debuts|film debut]] as a director in 2017 with the crime drama ''[[Molly's Game]]'', which garnered mostly positive reviews and earned him a third Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. His follow-up directorial film was the historical legal drama ''[[The Trial of the Chicago 7]]'' (2020) which earned six [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations including Sorkin's first nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]. As a writer, Sorkin is recognized for his trademark fast-paced dialogue and extended monologues, complemented by frequent collaborator [[Thomas Schlamme]]'s storytelling technique called the "[[walk and talk]]". These sequences consist of single [[tracking shot]]s of long duration involving multiple characters engaging in conversation as they move through the set; characters enter and exit the conversation as the shot continues without any cuts.

In 1979, Sorkin attended [[Syracuse University]]. In his [[freshman year]], he failed a class that was a core requirement, which caused a setback because he wanted to be an actor, and the drama department did not allow students to take the stage until they completed the core classes. Determined to do better, he returned for his sophomore year, and graduated in 1983 with a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degree in [[Musical Theatre]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Creation of the Future: The Role of the American University |author=Frank Harold Trevor Rhodes |date=October 2001 |publisher=Cornell University Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/creationoffutur00rhod/page/75 75–76] |isbn=978-0-8014-3937-7 }}</ref> Recalling the influence of theatre teacher [[Arthur Storch]], Sorkin said: "Arthur's reputation as a director, and as a disciple of [[Lee Strasberg]], was a big reason why a lot of us went to S.U.&nbsp;[Syracuse University]... 'You have the capacity to be so much better than you are', he started saying to me in September of my senior year. He was still saying it in May. On the last day of classes, he said it again, and I said, 'How?', and he answered, 'Dare to fail'. I've been coming through on his admonition ever since".<ref name=TimesVitello>{{cite news|last=Vitello|first=Paul|title=Arthur Storch, Stage Director, Dies at 87|url=http://theater.nytimes.com/2013/03/11/theater/arthur-storch-theater-director-is-dead-at-87.html|access-date=March 12, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 10, 2013|archive-date=March 12, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312130802/http://theater.nytimes.com/2013/03/11/theater/arthur-storch-theater-director-is-dead-at-87.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

He continued writing and eventually put together his first play, ''Removing All Doubt,'' which he sent to his former theatre teacher, Arthur Storch, who was impressed. In 1984, ''Removing All Doubt'' was staged for drama students at his alma mater, Syracuse University. After that, he wrote ''[[Hidden in This Picture]]'' which debuted [[Off-Off-Broadway|off-off-Broadway]] at Steve Olsen's [[Laurie Beechman Theatre|West Bank Cafe Downstairs Theatre Bar]] in New York City in 1988.

Goldman also approached Sorkin with a story premise, which Sorkin developed into the script for the thriller ''[[Malice (1993 film)|Malice]]''. Goldman oversaw the project as [[creative consultant]] while Sorkin wrote the first two drafts. However, he had to leave the project to finish the script for ''A Few Good Men'', so screenwriter [[Scott Frank]] stepped in and wrote two drafts of the ''Malice'' screenplay.

In 2005, Sorkin returned to theatre; he revised his play ''A Few Good Men'' for a production at London's [[West End theatre|West End]]. The play opened at the [[Theatre Royal Haymarket]] in the fall of the same year and was directed by [[David Esbjornson]], with [[Rob Lowe]] of ''The West Wing'' in the lead role.<ref>{{cite news|author=Fleming|first=Michael|date=April 24, 2005|title=West End boys club|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117921624.html|access-date=January 10, 2007}}</ref> Sorkin told ''[[Charlie Rose (TV series)|The Charlie Rose Show]]'' that he was developing a television series based on a late-night sketch comedy show similar to ''Saturday Night Live''.<ref name="CharlieRose-2003" /><ref>{{cite news|author=Scott Hettrick|date=September 11, 2003|title=Inside Move: Sorkin scripting play, pic|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117892324.html|access-date=January 14, 2007}}</ref> In October 2005, a pilot script dubbed ''Studio 7 on the Sunset Strip'', written by him and Schlamme as producer, started circulating in Hollywood and online.

}}Sorkin has written for the theater, film, and television, and in each medium his level of collaboration with other creators has varied. He began in theater, which involved a largely solitary writing process, then moved into film, where he collaborated with director Rob Reiner and screenwriter William Goldman, and eventually worked in television, where he collaborated very closely with director [[Thomas Schlamme]] for nearly a decade on the shows ''Sports Night'', ''The West Wing'' and ''Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip''; he now moves between all three media. He has a habit of [[chain smoking]] while he spends countless hours cooped up in his office plotting out his next scripts.<ref name="USWeekly-Jones" /> He describes his writing process as physical because he will often stand up and speak the dialogue he is developing.<ref name="ryan" /> 
{{Paragraph break}}
A ''New York Times'' article by [[Peter de Jonge]] explained that "''The West Wing'' is never plotted out for more than a few weeks ahead and has no major story lines", which De Jonge believed was because "with characters who have no flaws, it is impossible to give them significant arcs".<ref name="DeJonge-interview" /> Sorkin has stated: "I seldom plan ahead, not because I don't think it's good to plan ahead, there just isn't time."<ref name="WGA_East">{{cite web |title=Interview with Aaron Sorkin |publisher=The Writers Guild of America, East, Inc. |access-date=January 10, 2007 |page=6 |work=On Writing Magazine, Issue 18|date=February 2003 |url=http://www.wgaeast.org/newsletter_and_publications/pdf/onwriting18.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070128072902/http://www.wgaeast.org/newsletter_and_publications/pdf/onwriting18.pdf

Schlamme will create the look of the shows, work with the other directors, discuss the scripts with Sorkin as soon as they are turned in, make design and casting decisions, and attend the budget meetings; Sorkin tends to stick strictly to writing.<ref name="CC-interview"/> In response to what he perceived as unfair criticism of ''The Newsroom'', Jacob Drum of ''Digital Americana'' wrote, "The essential truth that the critics miss is that ''The Newsroom'' is Sorkin being Sorkin as he always has been and always will be: one part pioneer; one part self-conscious romantic; two parts actual Lewis & Clark-style pioneer, trapping his way across an old, old idea of an America that can always stand to raise its game—but most importantly, spinning a good yarn while he does so."<ref name="thedigitalamericana">{{cite web|url=http://thedigitalamericana.com/wall/#/aaron-sorkin-modern-tv-an-ode-to-the-american-playwright-kind-of|publisher=thedigitalamericana.com|title=The Digital Americana Wall|access-date=October 16, 2016|archive-date=October 29, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161029170104/http://thedigitalamericana.com/wall/#/aaron-sorkin-modern-tv-an-ode-to-the-american-playwright-kind-of|url-status=live}}</ref>
