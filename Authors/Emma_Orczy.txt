'''Baroness Emma Orczy''' (full name: Emma Magdolna Rozália Mária Jozefa Borbála Orczy de Orci) ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɔr|t|s|iː}}; 23 September 1865 – 12 November 1947), usually known as '''Baroness Orczy''' (the name under which she was published) or to her family and friends as '''Emmuska Orczy''', was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-born British [[novelist]] and [[playwright]]. She is best known for her series of novels featuring the [[The Scarlet Pimpernel|Scarlet Pimpernel]], the alter ego of Sir Percy Blakeney, a wealthy English [[fop]] who turns into a quick-thinking [[Escapology|escape artist]] in order to save [[French nobility|French aristocrats]] from "Madame Guillotine" during the [[French Revolution]], establishing the "hero with a [[secret identity]]" in popular culture.<ref name="Robb"/>

Opening in London's [[West End theatre|West End]] on 5 January 1905, ''The Scarlet Pimpernel'' became a favourite of British audiences. Some of Orczy's paintings were exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] in London. During World War I, she formed the Women of England's Active Service League, an unofficial organisation aimed at encouraging women to persuade men to volunteer for active service in the armed forces.

==Early life==
Orczy was born in [[Tarnaörs]], [[Heves County]], [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]]. She was the daughter of the composer Baron Félix [[Orczy]] de [[Orci]] (1835–1892) and Countess Emma Wass de [[Vasasszentegyed|Szentegyed et Cege]] (1839–1892).<ref>Szluha, Márton (2012): Vas vármegye nemes családjai II. kötet (Noble families from the county of Vas, II tome).

Her paternal grandfather, Baron László Orczy (1787–1880) was a royal councillor, and knight of the [[Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George|Sicilian order of Saint George]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.3.1/TH-266-12122-137523-99?cc=1542666&wc=M6WV-BM9:101520103,101722201 |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304091651/https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.3.1/TH-266-12122-137523-99?cc=1542666&wc=M6WV-BM9:101520103,101722201 |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> her paternal grandmother, Baroness Magdolna, born Magdolna Müller (1811–1879), was of Austrian origin.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.3.1/TH-266-12122-133677-0?cc=1542666&wc=M6WV-BM9:101520103,101722201 |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304104345/https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.3.1/TH-266-12122-133677-0?cc=1542666&wc=M6WV-BM9:101520103,101722201 |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Her maternal grandparents were the Count Sámuel Wass de Szentegyed et Cege (1815–1879), member of the Hungarian parliament,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.3.1/TH-267-11097-127369-82?cc=1542666&wc=M6WV-PTL:101520601,101622301 |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230949/https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.3.1/TH-267-11097-127369-82?cc=1542666&wc=M6WV-PTL:101520601,101622301 |archive-date=3 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and Rozália Eperjessy de Károlyfejérvár (1814–1884).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.3.1/TH-267-11097-128186-85?cc=1542666&wc=M6WV-PTL:101520601,101622301 |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307215634/https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.3.1/TH-267-11097-128186-85?cc=1542666&wc=M6WV-PTL:101520601,101622301 |archive-date=7 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Emma's parents left their estate for Budapest in 1868, fearful of the threat of a peasant revolution. They lived in Budapest, Brussels, and Paris, where Emma studied music unsuccessfully. Finally, in 1880, the 14-year-old Emma and her family moved to London, England where they lodged with their countryman, Francis Pichler, at 162 [[Great Portland Street]]. Orczy attended [[West London School of Art]] and then the [[Heatherley School of Fine Art]].

Although not destined to be a painter, it was at art school that she met a young illustrator named Henry George Montagu MacLean Barstow, the son of an English clergyman; they were married at St Marylebone parish church on 7 November 1894. It was the start of a joyful and happy marriage, which she described as "for close on half a century, one of perfect happiness and understanding, of perfect friendship and communion of thought."<ref>Orczy, Emmuska. ''Links in the Chain of Life'', Ch. 8. London: Hutchinson, 1947.</ref>

==Writing career==
They had very little money and Orczy started to work with her husband as a translator and an illustrator to supplement his low earnings. John Montague Orczy-Barstow, their only child, was born on 25 February 1899. She started writing soon after his birth but her first novel, ''[[The Emperor's Candlesticks]]'' (1899), was a failure. She did, however, find a small following with a series of [[detective stories]] in the ''[[Royal Magazine]]''. Her next novel, ''[[In Mary's Reign]]'' (1901), did better.

In 1903, she and her husband wrote a play based on one of her short stories about an English aristocrat, Sir Percy Blakeney, Bart., who rescued French aristocrats from the [[French Revolution]]: ''[[The Scarlet Pimpernel]]''. She submitted her novelisation of the story under the same title to 12 publishers. While waiting for the decisions of these publishers, [[Fred Terry]] and [[Julia Neilson]] accepted the play for production in London's [[West End theatre|West End]]. Initially, it drew small audiences, but the play ran four years in London, broke many stage records, eventually playing more than 2,000 performances and becoming one of the most popular shows staged in Britain. It was translated and produced in other countries, and underwent several revivals. This theatrical success generated huge sales for the novel. The couple moved to Thanet, Kent.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Baroness Emmuska Orczy  (1865 – 1947)|url=https://kent-maps.online/20c/20c-orczy-biography/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-10-23|website=kent-maps.online}}</ref>

Introducing the notion of a "hero with a [[secret identity]]" into popular culture, the Scarlet Pimpernel exhibits characteristics that would become standard superhero conventions, including the penchant for disguise, use of a signature weapon (sword), ability to out-think and outwit his adversaries, and a calling card (he leaves behind a [[Anagallis arvensis|scarlet pimpernel]] at each of his interventions).<ref name="Robb">{{cite book|last1=Robb|first1=Brian J.|title=A Brief History of Superheroes: From Superman to the Avengers, the Evolution of Comic Book Legends|date=May 2014|publisher=Hachette UK|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wCSfBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT15|page=15|isbn=9781472110701}}</ref> By drawing attention to his alter ego, Blakeney hides behind his public face as a slow-thinking, foppish playboy (like [[Bruce Wayne]]), and he also establishes a network of supporters, The League of the Scarlet Pimpernel, that aid his endeavours.<ref name="Robb"/><ref>{{cite book |title=Masquerade: Essays on Tradition and Innovation Worldwide |editor-first=Deborah |editor-last=Bell |chapter=The (Super) Hero's Masquerade |first=Ron |last=Naversen |pages=217''ff'' |publisher=McFarland |year=2015 |isbn=978-0-7864-7646-6}}</ref>

Orczy went on to write over a dozen sequels featuring Sir Percy Blakeney, his family, and the other members of the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel, of which the first, ''[[I Will Repay (novel)|I Will Repay]]'' (1906), was the most popular. The last Pimpernel book, ''[[Mam'zelle Guillotine]]'', was published in 1940. None of her three subsequent plays matched the success of ''The Scarlet Pimpernel''. She also wrote popular mystery fiction and many adventure romances. Her ''[[Lady Molly of Scotland Yard]]'' was an early example of a female detective as the main character. Other popular detective stories featured ''[[The Old Man in the Corner]]'', a sleuth who chiefly used logic to solve crimes.  Orczy was a founding member of the [[Detection Club]] (1930).

Orczy's novels were racy, mannered [[melodrama]]s and she favoured historical fiction. Critic Mary Cadogan states, "Orczy's books are highly wrought and intensely atmospheric".<ref name="mc">{{cite book|first=Mary |last=Cadogan |chapter=Orczy, Baroness |title=Twentieth-Century Romance and Historical Writers|editor-first=Aruna |editor-last=Vasudevan |edition=3rd |location=London |publisher=St. James Press |date=1994 |pages=499–501 |isbn=1558621806}}</ref> In ''[[The Nest of the Sparrowhawk]]'' (1909), for example, a malicious guardian in Puritan Kent tricks his beautiful, wealthy young ward into marrying him by disguising himself as an exiled French prince. He persuades his widowed sister-in-law to abet him in this plot, in which she unwittingly disgraces one of her long-lost sons and finds the other murdered by the villain. Even though this novel had no link to ''[[The Scarlet Pimpernel]]'' other than its shared authorship, the publisher advertised it as part of "The Scarlet Pimpernel Series".

==Later life==
Orczy's work was so successful that she was able to buy a house in [[Monte Carlo]], "Villa Bijou" at 19 Avenue de la Costa (since demolished), which is where she spent World War Two.  She was not able to return to London until after the war.  Montagu Barstow died in Monte Carlo in 1942.  Finding herself alone there and unable to travel, she wrote her memoir, ''Links in the Chain of Life'' (published 1947).<ref>introductory notes to 'The Scarlet Pimpernel', Sarah Juliette Sasson, Barnes & Noble Classics, 2005, {{ISBN|978-1-59308-234-5}}, p. v,xii</ref>

She held strong political views. Orczy was a firm believer in the superiority of the [[aristocracy]],<ref>"In spite of her attraction to strongly chivalric ideas, she writes about the "lower orders" with a distinct air of patronage and condescension, especially if they step out of line and fail to obey their "betters"". Cadogan, ''Twentieth-century romance and historical writers''.</ref> as well as being a supporter of British [[imperialism]] and [[militarism]].<ref name="mc" /> During the First World War, Orczy formed the Women of England's Active Service League, an unofficial organisation aimed at encouraging women to persuade men to volunteer for active service in the armed forces. Her aim was to enlist 100,000 women who would pledge "to persuade every man I know to offer his service to his country". Some 20,000 women joined her organisation.<ref>{{cite book|title=Keep the Home Fires Burning, Propaganda in the First World War |first=Cate |last=Haste |publisher=Allen Lane |date=1977}}</ref><ref>See also [[White feather#A symbol of cowardice|White feather – A symbol of cowardice]].</ref> Orczy was also strongly opposed to the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Scarlet Pimpernel Looks at the World: Essays, with a Portrait|last=Orczy|first=Emmuska|date=1933|publisher=John Heritage|location=London}}</ref>

She died in [[Henley-on-Thames]], Oxfordshire, on 12 November 1947.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

==Name pronunciation==
Asked how to say her name, Orczy told ''The Literary Digest'': "Or-tsey. ''Emmuska''—a diminutive meaning "little Emma"—accent on the first syllable, the ''s'' equivalent to ''sh'' in English; thus, {{respell|EM|moosh|ka}}."<ref>{{cite book|author-link=Charles Earle Funk |first=Charles Earle|last=Funk|title=What's the Name, Please?|publisher=Funk & Wagnalls |date=1936}}</ref>
