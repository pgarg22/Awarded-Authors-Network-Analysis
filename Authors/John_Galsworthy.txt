'''John Galsworthy''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|OM}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|ɔː|l|z|w|ɜr|ð|i}}; 14 August 1867 – 31 January 1933) was an English novelist and playwright. Notable works include ''[[The Forsyte Saga]]'' (1906–1921) and its sequels, ''A Modern Comedy'' and ''End of the Chapter''. He won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1932.

==Life==
Galsworthy was born at what is now known as Galsworthy House (then called Parkhurst)<ref>{{cite book|author1=Cherry, Bridget  |author2=Pevsner, Nikolaus|title=The Buildings of England, London 2: South|date=1983|publisher=Penguin Books|location=Harmondsworth, Middlesex, England|isbn=0-14-071047-7|page=321}}</ref> on [[Kingston Hill, London|Kingston Hill]] in [[Surrey]], [[England]], the son of John and Blanche Bailey (''née'' Bartleet) Galsworthy. His family was prosperous and well established, with a large property in [[Kingston upon Thames]] that is now the site of three schools: [[Marymount International School London|Marymount International School]], [[Rokeby Preparatory School]], and [[Holy Cross Preparatory School]]. He attended [[Harrow School|Harrow]] and [[New College, Oxford]]. He  took a Second in Law (Jurisprudentia) at Oxford in 1889,<ref>''Oxford University Calendar 1895'', Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1895, 262</ref> then trained as a barrister and was [[called to the bar]] in 1890. However, he was not keen to begin practising law and instead travelled abroad to look after the family's shipping business. During these travels, he met [[Joseph Conrad]] in 1893, then the first mate of a sailing-ship moored in the harbour of [[Adelaide]], [[Australia]], and the two future novelists became close friends. In 1895 Galsworthy began an affair with Ada Nemesis Pearson Cooper (1864–1956), the wife of his cousin Major Arthur Galsworthy. After her divorce ten years later, they were married on 23 September 1905 and stayed together until his death in 1933. Before their marriage, they often stayed clandestinely in a farmhouse called Wingstone in the village of [[Manaton]] on Dartmoor, Devon.<ref name="lg">{{cite book|last=Cooper|first=Robert M.|title=The Literary Guide & Companion to Southern England|publisher=Ohio University Press|year=1998|pages=[https://archive.org/details/literaryguidecom00coop/page/323 323]–324|isbn=0-8214-1225-6|url=https://archive.org/details/literaryguidecom00coop|url-access=registration|access-date=25 September 2008}}</ref> In 1908 Galsworthy took a long lease on part of the building, and it was their regular second home until 1923.<ref name="lg"/>

==Career==
''From the Four Winds'', a collection of short stories, was Galsworthy's first published work in 1897. These and several subsequent works were published under the [[pen name]] of John Sinjohn, and it was not until ''The Island Pharisees'' (1904) that he began publishing under his own name, probably owing to the recent death of his father. His first full-length novel, ''Jocelyn'', was published in an edition of 750 under the name of John Sinjohn—he later refused to have it republished. His first play, ''[[The Silver Box]]'' (1906),<ref>{{cite document|title=The silver box, a comedy in three acts|first=John|last=Galsworthy|date=1 January 1909|publisher=C. Scribner's Sons|oclc = 8792009}}</ref>—in which the theft of a prostitute's purse by a rich 'young man of good family' is placed beside the theft of a silver cigarette case from the rich man's father's house by 'a poor devil', with very different repercussions,<ref>Description of the plot from  ''John Galsworthy'', by George Orwell, ''Monde''   23 March 1929</ref> though justice was clearly done in each case—became a success, and he followed it up with ''The Man of Property'' (1906), the first book of a Forsyte trilogy. Although he continued writing both plays and novels, it was as a playwright that he was mainly appreciated at the time. Along with those of other writers of the period, such as [[George Bernard Shaw]], his plays addressed the [[social class|class system]] and other social issues, two of the best known being ''[[Strife (play)|Strife]]'' (1909) and ''[[The Skin Game (play)|The Skin Game]]'' (1920).

[[File:John galsworthy.jpg|thumb|John Galsworthy]]
He is now far better known for his novels, particularly ''[[The Forsyte Saga]]'', his trilogy about the eponymous family and connected lives. These books, as with many of his other works, deal with social class, and upper-middle class lives in particular. Although sympathetic to his characters, he highlights their insular, snobbish, and acquisitive attitudes and their suffocating moral codes. He is viewed as one of the first writers of the [[Edwardian era]] who challenged some of the ideals of society depicted in the preceding [[Victorian literature|literature of Victorian England]]. The depiction of a woman in an unhappy marriage furnishes another recurring theme in his work. The character of Irene in ''The Forsyte Saga'' is drawn from Ada Pearson, though her previous marriage was not as miserable as that of the character.

==Causes and honours==
===Causes===
Through his writings Galsworthy campaigned for a variety of causes, including [[prison reform]], women's rights, and [[animal welfare]], and also against censorship. Galsworthy was a supporter of British involvement in the [[First World War]]. In an article for ''[[The Daily News (UK)|The Daily News]]'' on 31 August 1914 Galsworthy called for war on Germany to protect [[Belgium]]. Galsworthy added "What are we going to do for Belgium — for this most gallant of little countries, ground, because of sheer loyalty, under an iron heel?" <ref>[[Caroline Elizabeth Playne|Playne Caroline Elisabeth]]. ''Society at War, 1914-1916''. New York, Houghton Mifflin, 1931 (p.87).</ref>  During the First World War he worked in a hospital in France as an [[orderly]], after being passed over for military service, and in 1917 turned down a [[knighthood]], for which he was nominated by Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]], on the precept that a writer's reward comes simply from writing itself.<ref name=pbs>{{ cite web |title=Masterpiece Theatre – The Forsyte Saga, Series I – Essays + Interviews – John Galsworthy<br>(see ¶ 6) |publisher=Public Broadcasting Service ([[PBS]])(US) |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/forsyte/ei_galsworthy.html |access-date=9 August 2015}}</ref>

Galsworthy opposed the slaughter of animals and fought for [[animal rights]].<ref>Sternlicht, Sanford. (1987). ''John Galsworthy''.

===Honours===
Galsworthy was offered a knighthood in 1918, but he refused it.  He was erroneously awarded the rank in the published list when his letter declining the honour went astray, but he was never given the accolade, and the honour was later withdrawn.<ref>A. Michie, God Save The Queen at 107 (1952).</ref>

In 1921 Galsworthy was elected as the first president of the [[PEN International]] literary club and was appointed to the [[Order of Merit (Commonwealth)|Order of Merit]] in 1929. He was awarded the 1932 Nobel Prize for Literature, having been nominated that same year by [[Henrik Schück]], a member of the [[Swedish Academy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show.php?id=8574|title=Nomination Database}}</ref> He was too ill to attend the Nobel Prize presentation ceremony on 10 December 1932,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VKskDwAAQBAJ&q=galsworthy+too+ill+to+attend+nobel+ceremony&pg=PA330|title=An Uncommon Reader: A Life of Edward Garnett, Mentor and Editor of Literary Genius|last=Smith|first=Helen|year=2017|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0374717414|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1932/press.html|title=Nobelprize.org|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2018-06-16}}</ref> and died seven weeks later.

==Death==
Galsworthy lived for the final seven years of his life at [[Bury, West Sussex|Bury]] in West Sussex. He died from a brain tumour at his London home, Grove Lodge, [[Hampstead]]. In accordance with his will he was cremated at [[Woking Crematorium|Woking]], with his ashes then being scattered over the [[South Downs]] from an aeroplane,<ref>Geoffrey Harvey, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33314 Galsworthy, John (1867–1933)], Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2006, accessed 29 July 2012</ref> but there are also memorials to him in [[Highgate Cemetery|Highgate 'New' Cemetery]]<ref>[http://www.poetsgraves.co.uk/other_writers.htm Other Writers].  www.poetsgraves.co.uk</ref> and in the cloisters of New College, Oxford, cut by [[Eric Gill]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kindersleyworkshop.co.uk/histmain.htm |title=A History of the Workshop |access-date=2009-11-03 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111070935/http://www.kindersleyworkshop.co.uk/histmain.htm#histdkappanc |archive-date=11 January 2010 }}. kindersleyworkshop.co.uk</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=MacCarthy|first=Fiona|title=Eric Gill|url=https://archive.org/details/ericgill0000macc|url-access=registration|publisher=Faber & Faber|year=1989|page=[https://archive.org/details/ericgill0000macc/page/276 276]|isbn=0-571-14302-4}}</ref> The popularity of his fiction waned quickly after his death, but the hugely successful black-and-white television adaptation ''[[The Forsyte Saga (1967 TV series)|The Forsyte Saga]]'' in 1967 renewed interest in his work.

===Legacy===
A number of John Galsworthy's letters and papers are held at the [[University of Birmingham]] Special Collections.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Small|first=Ian|date=1984|title=Special Collections Report: The Galsworthy Collection and Its Fate|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/375408/summary|journal=English Literature in Transition, 1880-1920|language=en|volume=27|issue=3|pages=236–238|issn=1559-2715}}</ref>

==Family==
Galsworthy's sister Lilian (1864–1924) was married to the German painter and lithographer [[Georg Sauter]] from 1894. With the beginning of [[World War I]], Sauter was interned as an enemy alien at [[Alexandra Palace]] and later expelled.<ref>{{cite book |last=Webb |first=Simon |title=British Concentration Camps: A Brief History from 1900–1975 |publisher=Pen and Sword| date=2016 |isbn=978-1473846326 |pages=50–51 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DVKqCwAAQBAJ&q=sauter&pg=PA50 }}</ref> Their son Rudolf Sauter (1895–1971) was also a painter and graphic artist, who among other things, illustrated the works of his uncle.
