==Life and career==
Until he was 11, he went to school in [[Fort Lee, New Jersey]], where he grew up. He then commuted to the [[Horace Mann School]] in the [[Bronx]], graduating in 1967.<ref Name="PR"/> He wrote poetry from this time, inspired by [[Keats]] and [[Kenneth Rexroth]] translations, among other works.<ref Name="PR"/> He started college at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] but dropped out and after taking a year out of school, he ended up, 1971, at the [[University of Victoria]] on [[Vancouver Island]], [[British Columbia]].<ref Name="PR"/> Drawn to the [[New York School (art)|New York poets]], including [[Frank O’Hara]], Kleinzahler then discovered the work of [[Basil Bunting]], who had a major influence on Kleinzahler's search for his own voice in poetry. He described Bunting's 1966 long poem ''Briggflatts'' (which its author described as "an autobiography, but not a statement of fact")<ref>Bunting, B. 1968. Collected Poems. London, Fulcrum Press</ref> as "everything I wanted in poetry.”<ref Name="PR"/> Bunting taught a creative writing course at Victoria: "He began with some poems by Hardy and Hopkins, ''The Wreck of the Deutschland'', and went up to Yeats and Pound, then David Jones, Williams, the poets who were important to Bunting, Hugh MacDiarmid, Lorine Niedecker, and H.D. All he did was smoke unfiltered Player’s and read to us". The Anglo-American poet [[Thom Gunn]] (1929–2004) was also a major influence: "the honest treatment of the poetic material at hand, not slipping into rhetorical or poetic postures, inflating subject matter or dodging difficulty," Kleinzahler explained in an interview in [[The Paris Review]] in the fall of 2007. Gunn would become a close friend.<ref Name="PR">[http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/5789/the-art-of-poetry-no-93-august-kleinzahler William Corbett (Fall 2007). "August Kleinzahler, The Art of Poetry No. 93". ''The Paris Review''].</ref> [[William Carlos Williams]] was also an important source of inspiration.

Amassing gambling debts and wanted by the police, Kleinzahler's brother committed suicide in 1971, when the poet was 21. They were very close and Kleinzahler was devastated by the death. The book ''Storm over Hackensack'' is dedicated to him and ''Cutty, One Rock'' is about him. Kleinzahler commented "he remains a sort of lodestar for me, encouraging my better, braver self."<ref Name="PR"/>

After college, Kleinzahler spent a year in Alaska working in "manpower jobs: hard labor" and then got a job at the Alaska State Museum. He got his teaching credentials and then lived in Montreal for two and a half years. A passionate blues lover, Kleinzahler wrote a music column for the ''San Diego Reader'' for many years.<ref Name="PR"/> He has lived in the [[Haight Ashbury]] neighborhood in [[San Francisco]] but has retained strong ties to his old home base in New Jersey. In 2005 he was named the first poet laureate of Fort Lee.

Kleinzahler is the author of ten books of poetry, including  ''The Strange Hours Travelers Keep'' and ''Sleeping It Off in Rapid City''.  He has also published a non-fiction work, ''Cutty, One Rock (Low Characters and Strange Places, Gently Explained)''. [[Allen Ginsberg]] commented: "August Kleinzahler's verse line is always precise, concrete, intelligent and rare - that quality of 'chiseled' verse memorable in [[Basil Bunting]]'s and [[Ezra Pound]]'s work. A loner, a genius."<ref name="poets.org"/>
