[[File:Roque Dalton en la sala Manuel Galich de la Casa de las Américas.jpg|thumb| Roque Dalton was a Salvadoran poet, essayist, journalist, political activist, and intellectual. He is considered one of Latin America's most compelling poets.]]

'''Roque Antonio Dalton García''' ([[San Salvador]], [[El Salvador]], 14 May 1935 – [[Quezaltepeque, La Libertad|Quezaltepeque]], El Salvador, 10 May 1975), born '''Roque Antonio García''', better known as '''Roque Dalton''', was a Salvadoran poet, essayist, journalist, communist activist, and intellectual. He is considered one of [[Latin America]]'s most compelling poets. He wrote emotionally strong, sometimes sarcastic, and image-loaded works dealing with life, death, love, and politics.

Even though he never received an academic degree, he took part in higher education at the [[University of Chile]] and the [[University of El Salvador]], where he studied law. He also visited the [[Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México|National Autonomous University of Mexico]]. While in [[Chile]], he began to study Marxism and on returning to El Salvador, he became a significant player in local politics. He began working with poetry after helping found the University Literary Circle. He joined the [[Communist Party of El Salvador]]. He was imprisoned in 1959 and 1960 for inciting revolt during the presidency of [[José María Lemus]].

In 1961, he was exiled from El Salvador, spending 1961 in Mexico, then moving to Cuba &ndash; where most of his poetry was published and where he completed his development as an author, but also in Mexico and Czechoslovakia. In Cuba, he became involved in the culture and received military training after the Bay of Pigs Invasion. After returning to El Salvador in 1965, he was arrested and interrogated by an agent of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]. In 1969, he returned to Cuba and then Prague to work as correspondent for ''The International Review: Problems of Peace and Socialism''. In the same year, he won the Poetry Prize [[Casa de las Américas]] for his book ''Taberna y otros lugares''.

After leaving Cuba, Dalton became involved in [[Salvadoran Civil War|El Salvador's civil war]], joining the [[People's Revolutionary Army (El Salvador)|People's Revolutionary Army]] (ERP) in 1973. In the ERP, he found himself in a serious internal dispute with leader Alejandro Rivas Mira, who was becoming an influential leader of the armed group. As a consequence, the leadership of the ERP decided to execute him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/roque-dalton|title=Roque Dalton|last=Dalton|first=Roque|date=2000-07-12|website=Roque Dalton {{!}} Academy of American Poets|access-date=2016-11-28}}</ref>

He is remembered for his bohemian lifestyle and the jovial, irreverent personality reflected in his literary work, as well as his commitment to social causes in El Salvador.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.laprensagrafica.com/opinion/editorial/274210-roque-dalton-honoris-causa|title=Roque Dalton Honoris Causa|last=Hernández|first=David|website=www.laprensagrafica.com|publisher=La Prensa Gráfica|access-date=2016-12-04}}</ref> His work is diverse, going beyond the influences of his Marxist beliefs. He is considered one of the most influential Salvadoran writers. Posthumously, he has received recognition as "Hijo Meritísimo" and "Poeta Meritísimo" by the Salvadoran government and an honorary doctorate degree from the Universidad de El Salvador.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://noticias.universia.com.sv/en-portada/noticia/2012/07/10/949559/reconocimiento-roque-dalton-poeta-salvadoreno-mas-destacado-epoca.html|title=Reconocimiento a Roque Dalton, el poeta salvadoreño más destacado de la época|last=noticias.universia.com.sv|newspaper=Noticias Universia El Salvador|access-date=2016-12-04}}</ref>

== Early life and education ==
Dalton was the son of Winnall Dalton and María García Medrano. Winnall Dalton emigrated{{clarify| from where?|date=September 2019}} to Mexico,  and came to El Salvador in the early 1920s. Winnall Dalton married Aida Ulloa,  and gaining control of his wife's large farm  dedicated his life to agriculture.  He survived an assassination attempt. The nurse who took care of Winnall Dalton in the Salvadoran hospital, María García Medrano, later gave birth to Roque Dalton. Her hard work and good luck allowed her to provide their children a high-quality education.

Roque graduated from [[Externado San José]], an exclusive Jesuit school for boys in San Salvador. Afterwards he was sent by his father to Santiago, Chile to study law in the Universidad de Chile. There, he established close relationships to [[leftist]] students and attended lectures with the Mexican artist [[Diego Rivera]]. Around this time, he developed a great interest in [[socialism]].

When he returned to El Salvador, he was accepted by the law school of the [[Universidad de El Salvador]] (UES), and in 1955 he and the Guatemalan poet [[Otto René Castillo]] founded Círculo Literario Universitario, which published some of Central America's most recognized literary figures.

== Writing and political career ==

[[File:Roque estrechando manos a combatientes en la Conferencia de los Pueblos.jpg|thumb|Roque stretching hands with combatants during the conference of the people.]]

In 1961 he travelled to [[Havana]], where he was welcomed by [[Casa de las Américas]], a gathering place for many exiled leftist Latin American writers. Dalton returned clandestinely to [[El Salvador]] in 1965  but was soon caught and taken prisoner. He awaited execution in [[Cojutepeque]], but he was miraculously saved. There was an [[earthquake]] and the wall from his prison cell fell down. Dalton took advantage of this and escaped. He slipped into a passing [[religious]] [[procession]] and managed to meet his fellow revolutionaries who helped him escape to [[Cuba]] again. He was then sent to [[Prague]] as a correspondent for The International Review: Problems for Peace and Socialism. While he was in Prague, he wrote his internationally acclaimed Taberna y Otros Lugares. He also produced a landmark biography of Miguel Mármol, a prominent Salvadoran [[communist]] who participated in the [[1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising]] and was living in exile in Prague.

In 1970 Roque Dalton had become a recognized figure in the Salvadoran left. He tried hard to become a revolutionary soldier, for which reason he participated in military training camps in Cuba several times. He once wrote: "Politics are taken up at the risk of life, or else you don't talk about it".

<blockquote>
Roque Dalton (1937–75) was the major literary figure and an important political architect of the revolutionary movement in El Salvador. Dalton represents a new type of Latin American writer: no longer the genial 'fellow traveler' of the revolution, like Pablo Neruda, but rather the rank and file revolutionary activist for whom the intricate cabbala of clandestine struggle-pass- words, safe houses, escape routes, forged documents, sectarian squabbles- was as familiar as Parisian surrealism. A dangerous and difficult profession, in which the event that seals a writer's reputation is often precocious martyrdom.
<ref>Beverley, John. “Poems: Roque Dalton, John Beverley, Edward Baker.” ''Social Text'', No. 5 (Spring, 1982), pp. 74-85.</ref>{{rp|[74]}}
</blockquote>

When he felt ready as a [[soldier]], he sought admission in the Salvadoran [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]], political-military organization FPL 
-Fuerzas Populares de Liberación "Farabundo Marti-" (Popular Liberation Forces "Farabundo Marti" in English). However, the organization's leader, Commander "Marcial" (whose real name was [[Salvador Cayetano Carpio]]), rejected his application, arguing that Roque's role in the revolution was as a [[poet]], and not as a foot-soldier. Because of this, he applied to join the [[Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front#Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo (ERP)|ERP]] - Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo- (People's Revolutionary Army in English). Though Dalton himself was not allowed to become part of the [[Fuerzas Populares de Liberación Farabundo Martí|FPL]], both his sons joined the FPL in the late 70s. Roque Dalton's military career also included cooperation with [[Guatemala]]n revolutionaries in creating [[Guerrilla Army of the Poor|EGP]] - Ejército Guerrillero de los Pobres (Guerrilla Army of the Poor in English).

== Assassination by the ERP ==
Once an active member in ERP, Dalton stressed the importance of establishing bonds with the organizations from civil society. Some of the other members of ERP disagreed with him. They accused him of trying to divide the organization. This group, whose most internationally known leader was [[Joaquín Villalobos]] ("Atilio"), allegedly condemned him to death on 10 May 1975, only four days before Roque was to turn 40. Therefore, Dalton's literary production stopped when a group of commandos, whose members were Villalobos and Jorge Melendez ([[nom de guerre]] 'Jonas') ended his life. This commando was sent by Edgar Alejandro Rivas Mira. Roque was shot to death in a house in the Santa Anita neighbourhood in San Salvador city. There were possibly others involved in his execution, but these are the ones still alive today: Villalobos settled in Great Britain; Melendez is an MP for San Salvador City for [[FMLN]] and Rivas Mira hides behind plastic surgeries, which were paid with money obtained from the kidnapping and murder of the multi-millionaire Roberto Poma. The most commonly accepted version of facts suggests that Dalton was "mistakenly accused" of operating as an agent for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], the reason for which he was executed.

<blockquote>
In 1975, he was back in El Salvador working in the underground. This was a difficult time for the revolutionary movement, and Dalton's own organization, the ERP, was torn by a bitter factional fight. Dalton criticized the organization's military adventurism and argued the need to build a mass base. Under circumstances that still remain obscure, he was accused of complicity with the CIA and assassinated by members of a rival faction of the ERP.<ref>Beverley, 74.</ref>
</blockquote>

The reason was that many things he was privy to were subsequently known by the government, and by implication the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. It is commonly suggested.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} that someone Roque knew and confided in, was an "oreja" (ear, or [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] spy/informant) and this is how confidential information was being discovered. Both the [[Fuerzas Populares de Liberación Farabundo Martí|FPL]] and [[Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front#Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo (ERP)|ERP]] were founding organizations of a united guerrilla front known as [[FMLN]].

==Recent developments==
On May 4, 2010, the magazine ''Contrapunto'' published an interview with Jorge Meléndez, at the time the director of Civil Protection, and known during the civil war as Commander Jonas.  During the interview he said with respect to the murder,  “I was there and know that which transpired there.” Although the comments by Tomás André, the correspondent for ''Contrapunto'' who conducted the interview are not known, the historical importance of the interview can be certainly discerned by the depth and extraordinary nature of the encounter that Melendez was well aware of the nature of the process that resulted in the assassination of Dalton and his friend Pancho.  To those who knew the author, the answer by Roque Dalton to the statements by this man could be easily imagined.  What is clear is that Roque Dalton would have not been displeased if anyone had then said that even now, the murderers are afraid of him, and that the accusations of CIA collaboration were then and now a simple after the fact excuse of a group of terrorists fully aware of the hideous nature of their acts.  ("Yo, Roque Dalton", 2012).<ref>J. Arturo Revelo, ''Yo, Roque Dalton''(1d.ed.) (April 2012)</ref>

On January 7, 2012, the Fiscalía Nacional, prosecuting agency for the FMLN  lead Salvadoran government, decree that the statute of limitations for the murder of Roque Dalton had expired. Juan José Dalton said of the act “Villalobos gave an interview where he states who made the decision to kill [my father]: Vladimir Rogel, [Jorge]  Meléndez  [y Villalobos]. That would be enough in any decent nation of this planet for a prosecutor to proceed.” El Salvador, not one of those places, instead printed a stamp with his effigy and declared his death a national tragedy.

== Legacy ==
Dalton's writing includes almost 15 poetry collections, a novel, a personal testimony, and a play, as well as short stories, critiques, and essays on both literature and politics. Some of his poetry has been translated to English, French, Czech, Russian and Italian. According to Luis Melgar Brizuela, he had the greatest influence from 1967 until the end of the Salvadoran Civil War in 1992. This was especially the case in leftist literary and intellectual groups, among them the literary groups Piedra y Siglo, La Masacuata and Xibalbá, as well as in the content of the magazines Abra and Taller de Letras, published by [[José Simeón Cañas Central American University]], the Literary Supplement 3000 in the [[Diario Co Latino]], Amate, and La Universidad.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.laprensagrafica.com/opinion/editorial/274210-roque-dalton-honoris-causa|title=Roque Dalton Honoris Causa|last=Hernández|first=David|website=www.laprensagrafica.com|publisher=La Prensa Gráfica|access-date=2016-12-04}}</ref>
