'''George Robert Acworth Conquest''' {{postnom|country=GBR|CMG|OBE|FBA|FRSL}} (15 July 1917 – 3 August 2015) was a British historian and poet.<ref name=NYTobit/> He is best known for his laws of politics.

A long-time research fellow at [[Stanford University]]'s [[Hoover Institution]], Conquest was most notable for his work on the [[Soviet Union]]. His books included [[The Great Terror (book)|''The Great Terror: Stalin's Purge of the Thirties'']] (1968); ''[[The Harvest of Sorrow|The Harvest of Sorrow: Soviet Collectivisation and the Terror-Famine]]'' (1986); and ''[[Stalin: Breaker of Nations]]'' (1991). He was also the author of two novels and several collections of poetry.

==Early life and education==
Conquest was born in [[Great Malvern]], Worcestershire,<ref name="NYTobit"/> to an American father, Robert Folger Wescott Conquest, and an English mother, Rosamund Alys Acworth.<ref>Encyclopedia of British Writers, 19th and 20th Centuries by Christine L. Krueger page 87</ref><ref>Science Fiction and Fantasy Literature, Volume 2 By R. Reginald, Douglas Menville, Mary A. Burgess</ref> His father served in an [[AFS Intercultural Programs|American Ambulance Field Service]] unit with the [[French Army in World War I]], and was awarded the [[Croix de Guerre 1914–1918 (France)|Croix de Guerre, with Silver Star]] in 1916.<ref>Supplement to the ''Alumni Register'' (October 1920), "Pennsylvania; A Record of the University's Men in the Great War", University of Pennsylvania General Alumni Society, 1920, page 40.</ref>

Conquest was educated at [[Winchester College]], where he won an [[Exhibition (scholarship)|exhibition]] to study [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]] (PPE) at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]. He took a gap year, spending time at the [[University of Grenoble]] and in Bulgaria, and returning to Oxford in 1937, where he joined the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] and the [[Carlton Club]].<ref name=Brown/> He was awarded an [[Master of Arts (Oxford, Cambridge, and Dublin)|MA]] in PPE and a [[DLitt]] in history.<ref>{{cite web |title=Robert Conquest |url=https://www.hoover.org/profiles/robert-conquest |website=Hoover Institution |access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref>

==Career==
===War years===
In Lisbon on an American passport at the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]], Conquest returned to England.<ref name=Quadrant>{{cite web|title=Vale Robert Conquest, Historian and Poet|url=http://quadrant.org.au/opinion/qed/2015/08/vale-robert-conquest/|website=Quadrant|publisher=quadrant.org.au|access-date=15 October 2015}}</ref> As the Communist Party of Great Britain denounced the war in 1939 as imperialist and capitalist, Conquest broke with it and was commissioned into the [[Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry]] on 20 April 1940, serving with the regiment until 1946.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=34837 |date=23 April 1940 |page=2459 |supp=y}}</ref><ref name="Brown"/>

In 1943, he was posted to the [[School of Slavonic and East European Studies]] (later part of [[University College London]]) to study Bulgarian.<ref name=Telegraphobit/> The following year he was posted to [[Bulgaria]] as a [[liaison officer]] to the Bulgarian forces fighting under Soviet command, attached to the Third Ukrainian Front, then to the [[Allied Control Commission]]. At the end of the war, he joined the [[Foreign Office]], returning to the British Legation in [[Sofia]] where he remained as the press officer.<ref name=NYTobit/> In 1948, he left Bulgaria when he was recalled to London under a minor diplomatic cloud after he had helped smuggle two Bulgarians out of the country.<ref name=Telegraphobit/>

===Foreign Office===
In 1948, Conquest joined the Foreign Office's [[Information Research Department]] (IRD), a "propaganda counter-offensive" unit created by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Clement Attlee|Attlee]] government<ref name="Leigh"/> in order to "collect and summarize reliable information about Soviet and communist misdoings, to disseminate it to friendly journalists, politicians, and trade unionists, and to support, financially and otherwise, anticommunist publications."<ref>Timothy Garton Ash. "Orwell's List" (review), ''New York Review of Books'', 23 September 2003.</ref> The IRD was also engaged in manipulating public opinion.<ref name="Baltic Worlds 2">{{cite web|last1=Samuelson|first1=Lennart|title=A pathbreaker.

In 1949, Conquest's assistant Celia Kirwan, later Celia Goodman, approached [[George Orwell]] for information to help identify Soviet sympathisers. [[Orwell's list]], discovered after her death in 2002, included ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Observer|Observer]]'' journalists, as well as [[E. H. Carr]] and [[Charlie Chaplin]].<ref name="Homberger">{{cite news |last=Homberger |first=Eric |date=5 August 2015 |title=Robert Conquest obituary |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/05/robert-conquest |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=11 September 2015}}</ref> Conquest, like Orwell, fell for the beautiful Celia Kirwan, who inspired him to write several poems.<ref name=Telegraphobit/> One of his foreign office colleagues was Alan Maclean, brother of [[Donald Maclean (spy)|Donald Maclean]], one of the [[Kim Philby|Philby]] spy ring, who fled to Russia with [[Guy Burgess]] in 1951. When his brother defected, Alan resigned, then went to Macmillan and published a book of Conquest's poems.<ref name="Brown"/> At the Foreign Office, Conquest wrote several papers that sowed the seeds for his later work. One, on the Soviet means of obtaining confessions, was elaborated on in ''The Great Terror''. Other papers were "Peaceful Co-existence in Soviet Propaganda and Theory", and "United Fronts&nbsp;– a Communist Tactic".<ref name=Telegraphobit/> In 1950 Conquest served briefly as First Secretary in the British Delegation to the United Nations.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

===Writing===
In 1956, Conquest left the Foreign Office and became a freelance writer and historian.<ref name=Telegraphobit/> After he left, he says, the Information Research Department (IRD) suggested to him that he could combine some of the data he had gathered from Soviet publications into a book.<ref name="Leigh">{{cite news |last=Leigh |first=David |author-link=David Leigh (journalist) |date=27 January 1978 |title=Death of the department that never was |url=http://www.cambridgeclarion.org/e/fo_deceit_unit_graun_27jan1978.html |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=11 September 2015}}</ref> During the 1960s, he edited eight volumes of work produced by the IRD, published in London by [[the Bodley Head]] as the Soviet Studies Series.<ref name="Leigh"/> Many of his Foreign Office works were published this way.<ref name=Telegraphobit/> In the United States, the material was republished as The Contemporary Soviet Union Series by [[Greenwood Publishing Group|Frederick Praeger]], who had previously published several books on communism at the request of the CIA,<ref name="Leigh"/> in addition to works by [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], [[Milovan Đilas]], [[Howard Fast]], and [[Charles Patrick Fitzgerald]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Lyons |first=Richard D. |date=5 June 1994 |title=Frederick A.

In 1962–1963, Conquest was literary editor of ''[[The Spectator]]'', but he resigned when he found the job interfering with his historical writing. His first books on the Soviet Union were ''Common Sense About Russia'' (1960), ''The Soviet Deportation of Nationalities'' (1960) and ''Power and Policy in the USSR'' (1961). His other early works on the Soviet Union included ''Courage of Genius: The Pasternak Affair'' (1961) and ''Russia After Khrushchev'' (1965).<ref name=Telegraphobit/>

==Historical works==
===''The Great Terror'' (1968)===
{{Main|The Great Terror (book)}}
In 1968, Conquest published what became his best-known work, ''The Great Terror: Stalin's Purge of the Thirties'', the first comprehensive research of the [[Great Purge]], which took place in the Soviet Union between 1934 and 1939. Many reviewers at the time were not impressed by his way of writing about the Great Terror, which was in the tradition of "great men who make history".<ref name="Baltic Worlds 2" /> The book was based mainly on information which had been made public, either officially or by individuals, during the so-called "[[Khrushchev Thaw]]" in the period 1956–64. It also drew on accounts by Russian and Ukrainian [[émigré]]s and [[exile]]s dating back to the 1930s, and on an analysis of official Soviet documents such as the [[Soviet census]].<ref name=GT1>{{cite book|last1=Conquest|first1=Robert|title=The Great Terror|date=1968|edition=1st}}</ref> The most important aspect of the book was that it widened the understanding of the purges beyond the previous narrow focus on the "[[Moscow trials]]" of disgraced [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] leaders such as [[Nikolai Bukharin]] and [[Grigory Zinoviev]], who were executed shortly thereafter. The question of why these leaders had pleaded guilty and confessed to various crimes at the trials had become a topic of discussion for a number of [[Western culture|Western]] writers, and helped inspire anti-totalitarian tracts such as [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' and [[Arthur Koestler]]'s ''[[Darkness at Noon]]''.<ref name="WSJ 4" />

Conquest argued that the trials and executions of these former Communist leaders were a minor detail of the purges. By his estimates, Stalinist purges had led to the deaths of some 20 million people. He later stated that the  total number of deaths could "hardly be lower than some thirteen to fifteen million."<ref>Robert Conquest, Preface, ''The Great Terror: A Reassessment: 40th Anniversary Edition'', Oxford University Press, USA, 2007. p. xviii</ref> Conquest accused Western intellectuals such as [[Beatrice Webb|Beatrice]] and [[Sidney Webb]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Walter Duranty]], [[Bernard Pares|Sir Bernard Pares]], [[Harold Laski]], [[D. N. Pritt]], [[Theodore Dreiser]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Owen Lattimore]], and [[Romain Rolland]], as well as American ambassador [[Joseph E. Davies|Joseph Davies]], of being dupes of Stalin and apologists for his regime. Conquest cites various comments made by them where, he argues, they were denying, excusing, or justifying various aspects of the purges.<ref>Robert Conquest, ''The Great Terror: A Reassessment'', Oxford University Press (1990) {{ISBN|0-19-507132-8}}, pp. 466–75.</ref>

After the opening up of the [[Soviet archives]], detailed information was released that Conquest argued supported his conclusions. When Conquest's publisher asked him to expand and revise ''The Great Terror'', Conquest is said to have suggested the new version of the book be titled ''I Told You So, You Fucking Fools.'' In fact, the mock title was jokingly proposed by Conquest's old friend [[Kingsley Amis]]. The new version was published in 1990 as ''The Great Terror: A Reassessment''.<ref>Conquest, Robert.

Many aspects of his book are [[The Great Terror (book)#Reception, impact, and debates|disputed]] by [[Sovietologist]] historians and researchers on Russian and Soviet history, such as [[Stephen G.

In 1996, Marxist historian [[Eric Hobsbawm]], who had been previously attacked by Conquest for his book ''[[Age of Extremes]]'',<ref>{{cite news |last=Moyihan |first=Michael C. |author-link=Michael C. Moynihan |date=20 August 2011 |title=How a True Believer Keeps the Faith |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512722707621288 |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |access-date=9 January 2012}}</ref> while praising Conquest's ''The Great Terror'' as "a remarkable pioneer effort to assess the Stalin Terror", said that this work and others were now obsolete "simply because the archival sources are now available." As a result, he wrote, there was no need for "fragmentary sources" and "guesswork". "[W]hen better or more complete data are available, they must take the place of poor and incomplete ones."<ref name="Hobsbawm">{{cite book |last=Hobsbawm  |first=Eric |date=2011 |title=On History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WVuIyMVegT8C |publisher=Hachette UK |page=Chapter 19 |isbn=978-1780220512}}</ref>

In 2002, Conquest replied to his critics: "They're still talking absolute balls. In the academy, there remains a feeling of, 'Don't let's be too rude to Stalin. He was a bad guy, yes, but the Americans were bad guys too, and so was the British Empire.{{'"}}<ref name="The National Review"/> Conquest openly declared himself to have been a Cold Warrior, a title which he rather relished:<ref name="TLS Hitchens"/> "They say [disapprovingly] that we were Cold Warriors.

A lot of people weren't Cold Warriors—and so much the worse for them."<ref name="The National Review">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/215908/robert-conquest-an-appreciation|title=Robert Conquest an appreciation|date=5 August 2015|publisher=nationalreview.com|access-date=18 September 2015}}</ref>

===''The Harvest of Sorrow'' (1986)===
{{Main|The Harvest of Sorrow}}
In 1986, Conquest published ''The Harvest of Sorrow: Soviet Collectivisation and the Terror-Famine'', dealing with the collectivisation of agriculture in [[Ukraine]] and elsewhere in the USSR, under Stalin's direction in 1929–31, and the resulting famine, in which millions of peasants died due to [[starvation]], [[deportation]] to [[labour camp]]s, and execution. In this book, Conquest supported the view that the famine was a planned act of genocide.<ref name=Telegraphobit/> According to historians [[Stephen Wheatcroft]] and [[R. W. Davies]], "Conquest holds that Stalin wanted the famine ... and that the Ukrainian famine was deliberately inflicted for its own sake." In 2003, Conquest wrote to them that "Stalin purposely inflicted the 1933 famine? No. What I argue is that with resulting famine imminent, he could have prevented it, but put 'Soviet interest' other than feeding the starving first thus consciously abetting it."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wheatcroft|first=Stephen|date=June 2006|title=Stalin and the Soviet Famine of 1932-33: A Reply to Ellman|url=https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/hf/iakh/HIS2319/h16/pensumliste/stalin-and-the-soviet-famine-of-1932-33_-a-reply-to-ellman.pdf|journal=Europe-Asia Studies|volume=58|issue=4|pages=625–633|via=JSTOR}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1= Wheatcroft |first1=Stephen G.|last2=Davies |first2= R.

===''Stalin and the Kirov Murder'' (1989)===
For the [[Trotskyists]], Kirov's murder was the Stalinist equivalent of the [[Reichstag fire]], deliberately started by the Nazis to justify the arrest of German Communists. The Trotskyist-[[Menshevik]] view became the dominant one among Western historians, popularised in Conquest's influential books.<ref name=Priestland>{{cite journal|last1=Priestland|first1=David|title=The Kirov Murder and Soviet History|journal=History Today|date=May 2011|volume=61|issue=5|url=http://www.historytoday.com/blog/books-blog/david-priestland/kirov-murder-and-soviet-history|access-date=27 September 2015}}</ref>

In ''[[The Great Terror (book)|The Great Terror]]'', Conquest had attacked the official Soviet story of conspiracy and treason. Conquest placed the murder in 1934 of the Leningrad party boss, [[Sergei Kirov]], one of Stalin's inner circle, as the key to the mechanism of terror. He returned to this in ''Stalin and the Kirov Murder'' (1989), where he argued that Stalin not only sanctioned Kirov's assassination, but used it as a justification for the terror that climaxed in 1937&ndash;38, though no evidence has been found to confirm Stalin's role in the murder.<ref name="Homberger" /><ref name="Figes">''The Whisperers'', Orlando Figes, Allen Lane 2007, p. 236n</ref><ref name="Getty on Kirov">Getty, J.

==Poetry and literature==
===Poems===
In addition to his scholarly work, Conquest was a well-regarded poet<ref>David Yezzi, ''Yale Review'', Volume 98, Issue 2 (April 2010), p. 183 ff.<!-- ISBN needed --></ref> whose poems have been published in various periodicals from 1937. In 1945, he was awarded the PEN Brazil Prize for his war poem "For the Death of a Poet" about an army friend, the poet Drummond Allison, killed in Italy. In 1951, he received a Festival of Britain verse prize.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://waywiser-press.com/conquest.html|title=Robert Conquest, ''Penultimata'': Note on Robert Conquest|publisher=waywiser-press.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115171724/http://waywiser-press.com/conquest.html|archive-date=15 January 2014}}</ref> During his lifetime, he had seven volumes of poetry<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2010/august/conquest-historian-poet-081610.html|title=Stanford legend Robert Conquest: new books at 93 for the historian and poet|work=Stanford Report|date=16 August 2010|access-date=4 August 2015|first=Cynthia|last=Haven}}</ref> and one of literary criticism<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/confront-genocide/speakers-and-events/biography/robert-conquest|title=Robert Conquest|publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|access-date=4 August 2015}}</ref> published.

Conquest was a major figure in a prominent British literary circle known as [[The Movement (literature)|"The Movement"]] which also included [[Philip Larkin]] and [[Kingsley Amis]]. Movement poets, many of whom bristled at being so labelled, rejected the experiments of earlier practitioners such as [[Ezra Pound]].<ref name="WSJ 4" />

In 1956 and 1962, Conquest edited the influential ''New Lines'' anthologies, introducing works by them, as well as [[Thom Gunn]], [[Dennis Enright]], and others, to a wider public.<ref>Zachary Leader, ed., ''The Movement Reconsidered'', Oxford University Press, 2009.</ref> He spent 1959–60 as visiting poet at the [[University of Buffalo]]. Several of his poems were published in ''The New Oxford Book of Light Verse'' (1978; compiled by Amis), under the pseudonyms "Stuart Howard-Jones", "Victor Gray" and "Ted Pauker".{{citation needed|reason=old source not suitable for factual claims|date=March 2020}}

[[Philip Larkin]]'s [[Selected Letters of Philip Larkin, 1940–1985|published letters]] revealed that Conquest and Larkin shared an enthusiasm for pornography in the 1950s.<ref name=Telegraphobit/> When Larkin was in Hull, Conquest sent him judicious selections of the latest pornography, and, when he came down to London, Conquest took him on shopping trips to the Soho porn shops.<ref name="Homberger"/> On one occasion in 1957, Conquest wrote a letter to Larkin purporting to come from the Vice Squad which had found the poet's name on a pornographic publisher's list. Larkin panicked and went to see his solicitor, convinced that he was going to lose his job as librarian at Hull University, before Conquest owned up.<ref name=Telegraphobit/> The true story of the joke became in 2008, ''[[Mr Larkin's Awkward Day]]'', a comedy radio play by Chris Harrald.<ref>{{cite web |author=BBC Radio 4 Publicity |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/proginfo/radio/wk18/tue.shtml |title=Mr Larkin's Awkward Day |publisher=[[BBC Radio 4]] | date=29 April 2008}}</ref>

Soon after his expulsion from the Soviet Union, [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] met with Conquest, asking him to translate a 'little' poem of his into English verse. This was "[[Prussian Nights]]", nearly two thousand lines in ballad metre, published in 1977.<ref>Robert Conquest, 'Solzhenitsyn, A Genius with a Blindspot', ''Sunday Times'', 10 August 2008; p. A15</ref>

A new ''Collected Poems'', edited by Elizabeth Conquest, was published in March 2020 by the Waywiser Press.<ref>[https://waywiser-press.com/product/collected-poems/ ''Collected Poems'', Robert Conquest]</ref>

===Novels===
Conquest had been a member of the [[British Interplanetary Society]] since the 1940s, and shared Amis's taste for science fiction. Starting from 1961, the two writers jointly edited ''Spectrum'', five anthologies of new sci-fi writing.<ref name="Homberger"/> Conquest also proposed to Amis a collaboration based on a draft comic novel that Conquest had completed. This was revised by Amis, then it appeared under both their names as ''The Egyptologists'' (1965).<ref name="Homberger"/> The novel is about a secret Egyptological London society that is really a husbands' organisation serving as an alibi for philanderers.<ref name="WSJ 4"/><ref name="LA Times">{{cite news |last=Hillier |first=Bevis |author-link=Bevis Hillier |date=19 November 1986 |title=Harvest' of Soviet Terrorism Reaped by Historian Conquest |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-11-19/news/vw-4241_1_soviet-union |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=4 October 2015}}</ref> A reviewer in ''[[The New York Times]]'' felt that their "elaborate little jokes leave an unpleasant taste."<ref name="Homberger"/>

==Political works==

===Laws of politics===
{{anchor|Three Laws of Politics}}
{{anchor|Two Laws of Politics}}
Conquest posited two laws of politics, apparently not referenced in any of his books but as observations he made in conversations while alive:<ref name="Vogel"/>
# Generally speaking, everybody is reactionary on subjects he knows about.
# Every organisation appears to be headed by secret agents of its opponents.

Conquest's first and second law are attested by at least two sources.<ref name="Vogel">{{cite web|last=Vogel|first=Martin|date=17 December 2018|url=https://vogelwakefield.com/2018/12/tracking-down-conquests-law-on-organisations/|title=Tracking down Conquest's law on organisations|website=Vogel Wakefield|accessdate=13 October 2021}}</ref> On 14 February 2003, [[Andrew Brown (writer)|Andrew Brown]] wrote of Conquest's campaign against the expansion of university education that "[f]rom this period dates 'Conquest's Law', which states that 'Everyone is a reactionary about subjects he understands'. This was later supplemented with the balancing rule that every organisation behaves as if it is run by secret agents of its opponents."<ref name="Brown"/> In his 1991 ''Memoirs'', [[Kingsley Amis]] wrote of Conquest that "he was to point out that, while very 'progressive' on the subject of colonialism and other matters I was ignorant of, I was a sound reactionary about education, of which I had some understanding and experience. From my own and others' example he formulated his famous First Law, which runs, 'Generally speaking, everybody is reactionary on subjects he knows about.' (The Second Law, more recent, says, 'Every organisation appears to be headed by secret agents of its opponents.')"<ref>{{cite book|last=Amis|first=Kingsley|year=2012|orig-year=1991|url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Memoirs/_neTtBlqCU4C|title=Memoirs|edition=E-book|publisher=Random House|page=146|isbn=9781446414668|accessdate=13 October 2021|via=Google Books}}</ref>

On 25 June 2003, [[John Derbyshire]] wrote in the ''[[National Review Online]]''{{'}}s blog ''The Corner'' that "[a]s best I can remember", Conquest conjectured three laws of politics:<ref>{{cite web|last=Derbyshire|first=John|date=25 June 2003|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/conquests-laws-john-derbyshire/|title=Conquest's Laws|website=National Review|accessdate=13 October 2021}}</ref>
# Everyone is conservative about what he knows best.
# Any organization not explicitly right-wing sooner or later becomes left-wing.
# The simplest way to explain the behavior of any bureaucratic organization is to assume that it is controlled by a cabal of its enemies.

Derbyshire commented: "Of the Second Law, Conquest gave the [[Church of England]] and [[Amnesty International]] as examples. Of the third, he noted that a bureaucracy sometimes actually ''IS'' controlled by a secret cabal of its enemies — e.g. the postwar [[British secret service]]." For these statements, Conquest would become well-known among certain thinkers, especially online [[conservative]]s; however, Derbyshire cited no source for them and implied his memory was not certain on the matter. Indeed, the second law given here is [[O'Sullivan's first law]], which was stated by [[John O'Sullivan (columnist)|John O'Sullivan]] in his article "O'Sullivan's First Law" in the 27 October 1989 print issue of the ''[[National Review]]'', in which he also references Derbyshire's Conquest's third law as Conquest's second law:
{{blockquote|text=That is explained by O'Sullivan's First Law: All organizations that are not actually right-wing will over time become left-wing. I cite as supporting evidence the ACLU, the Ford Foundation, and the Episcopal Church. The reason is, of course, that people who staff such bodies tend to be the sort who don't like private profit, business, making money, the current organization of society, and, by extension, the Western world. At which point Michels's [[Iron Law of Oligarchy]] takes over — and the rest follows.

Is there any law which enables us to predict the behavior of right-wing organizations? As it happens, there is: Conquest's Second Law (formulated by the Sovietologist Robert Conquest):

The behavior of an organization can best be predicted by assuming it to be controlled by a secret cabal of its enemies. Examples: virtually any conservative party anywhere, the Ronald Lauder for Mayor campaign, and the British secret service. That last example is, however, flawed, since the British secret service actually was controlled by a secret cabal of its enemies in the form of Kim Philby, Anthony Blunt, et al. In which case, Conquest's Law should have operated to make M1-6 a crack anti-Soviet intelligence service of James Bond proportions. But these are deep waters.<ref>{{cite web|last=O'Sullivan|first=John|date=27 October 1989|url=http://old.nationalreview.com/flashback/flashback-jos062603.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715191034/http://old.nationalreview.com/flashback/flashback-jos062603.asp|archivedate=1 July 2010|url-status=dead|title=Conquest's Laws|website=National Review|accessdate=13 October 2021}}</ref>}}

===''What to Do When the Russians Come'' (1984)===
In 1984, Conquest wrote with [[Jon Manchip White]] the fictional book ''What to Do When the Russians Come: a Survivor's Guide'' which, however, was intended to be a real survival manual in case of Soviet invasion. This book, as many other works of the mid-1980s in different media, like [[John Hackett (British Army officer)|John Hackett]]'s ''[[The Third World War: The Untold Story|The Third World War]]'', the movie ''[[Red Dawn]]'', and the [[Milton Bradley]] game ''[[Fortress America (board game)|Fortress America]]'', starts from the premise that a Soviet ground-invasion of the United States could be imminent and that the Soviet Union was about to engulf the world. Conquest wrote:

<blockquote>It is widely accepted that the United States now faces a real possibility of succumbing to the power of an alien regime unless the right policies are pursued. [This book's aim] is, first, to show the American citizen clearly and factually what the results of this possible Soviet domination could be and how it would affect him or her personally; and second, to give some serious advice on how to survive."<ref name="russians come 1">{{cite book|last1=Conquest|first1=Robert|last2=Manchip White|first2=Jon|title=What to Do When the Russians Come: a Survivor's Guide|date=1984|publisher=Stein and Day|isbn=0812829859|page=[https://archive.org/details/whattodowhenruss00conq/page/n164 7]|url=https://archive.org/details/whattodowhenruss00conq|url-access=registration|access-date=24 September 2015}}</ref></blockquote>

Conquest supported the Reagan defence buildup and asked for an increase of expenses on US defence budget, claiming that in the nuclear field [[NATO]] was only possibly matching USSR military power:

<blockquote>We live in dangerous times. Such miscalculations are very possible. But they are not inevitable. The American people and their representatives have it in their power to prevent their country from undergoing the ordeal we have described. A democratic government, with all its distractions and disadvantages ... It is not infallible, it is slow to learn, and it is willing to grasp at comfortable illusions; but it may yet act decisively"<ref name="russians come 2">{{cite book|last1=Conquest|first1=Robert|last2=Manchip White|first2=Jon|title=What to Do When the Russians Come: a Survivor's Guide|date=1984|publisher=Stein and Day|isbn=0812829859|page=[https://archive.org/details/whattodowhenruss00conq/page/175 175]|url=https://archive.org/details/whattodowhenruss00conq|url-access=registration|access-date=24 September 2015}}</ref>

"But why should we fear that such an ordeal may face us? The economic potential of the West in gross national product is far greater than that of the Soviet Union....In fact, the Soviet Union is economically far behind the United States. American technology is always a generation ahead of theirs. They have to turn to the United States for wheat. The Soviet economy is at a dead end. The Communist system has failed to win support in any of the countries of Eastern Europe. The Soviet idea has no attractions. On any calculation—of economic power or social advance or intellectual progress there could be no question of the Russians imposing their will. But in terms of actual military power, the West's advantage does not seem to have been made use of. It is at least matched, and many would say overmatched, in the nuclear field; the Western forces in Europe have less than half the striking power of their opponents. It is no good our being more advanced than they are if this is not translated into power—both military power and political willpower."<ref name="russians come 3">{{cite book|last1=Conquest|first1=Robert|last2=Manchip White|first2=Jon|title=What to Do When the Russians Come: a Survivor's Guide|date=1984|publisher=Stein and Day|isbn=0812829859|pages=[https://archive.org/details/whattodowhenruss00conq/page/176 176]–177|url=https://archive.org/details/whattodowhenruss00conq|url-access=registration|access-date=24 September 2015}}</ref></blockquote>

In 1986, Conquest said that "a science-fiction attitude is a great help in understanding the Soviet Union. It isn't so much whether they're good or bad, exactly; they're not bad or good as we'd be bad or good. It's far better to look at them as Martians than as people like us."<ref name="LA Times" />

''Reflections on a Ravaged Century''<ref>''[https://archive.org/details/ReflectionsOnARavagedCentury Reflections on a Ravaged Century]''</ref> is a book devoted to the psychological roots of fanaticism, in which Conquest argues that Communism and Nazism were equal and more twins than opposites.<ref name="TLS Hitchens">{{cite news|last1=Hitchens|first1=Christopher|title=Against sinister perfectionism|agency=The Times Literary Supplement|url=http://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/public/against-sinister-perfectionism/|date=26 November 1999|access-date=25 May 2016}}</ref>

There is much more in this book about communism than Nazism, partly because of Conquest's greater expertise on communism, and partly because comparatively few Western intellectuals became Nazis. He focuses mainly on attacks on intellectuals in the West who became communists because they felt or believed that this was "anti-fascism" or "anti-Nazism".<ref name="TLS Hitchens"/>
