Both parents were working at [[Fettes College]] in [[Edinburgh]] when they met. They married on 18 December 1879. William Parker Brooke had to resign after the couple wed as there was no accommodation there for married masters. The couple then moved to Rugby in Warwickshire where Rupert's father became Master of School Field House at [[Rugby School]] a month later. His eldest brother was Richard England "Dick" Brooke (1881–1907), his sister Edith Marjorie Brooke was born in 1885 and died the following year, and his youngest brother was William Alfred Cotterill "Podge" Brooke (1891–1915).<ref name="Friends: Brooke's admission">{{cite web

Brooke attended [[preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory (prep) school]] locally at [[Hillbrow School|Hillbrow]], and then went on to Rugby School. At Rugby he was romantically involved with fellow pupils Charles Lascelles, Denham Russell-Smith and [[Michael Sadleir]].<ref>Keith Hale, The Bisexual Brooke. Create Space Publishing, 2016.</ref> In 1905, he became friends with [[St. John Lucas]], who thereafter became something of a mentor to him.<ref name="Friends: Brooke's admission"/>

In October 1906 he went up to [[King's College, Cambridge]] to study Classics. There he became a member of the [[Cambridge Apostles|Apostles]], was elected as president of the university [[Cambridge Universities Labour Club|Fabian Society]], helped found the [[Marlowe Society]] drama club and acted, including in the [[Cambridge Greek Play]]. The friendships he made at school and university set the course for his adult life, and many of the people he met—including [[George Mallory]]—fell under his spell.<ref>Davis, Wade (2011).

==Life and career==
[[File: Rupert Brooke statue.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A statue of Brooke in [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]]]]
Brooke made friends among the [[Bloomsbury group]] of writers, some of whom admired his talent while others were more impressed by his good looks. He also belonged to another literary group known as the [[Georgian poets|Georgian Poets]] and was one of the most important of the [[Dymock poets]], associated with the [[Gloucestershire]] village of [[Dymock]] where he spent some time before the war. This group included both [[Robert Frost]] and [[Edward Thomas (poet)|Edward Thomas]]. He also lived at the [[Old Vicarage, Grantchester|Old Vicarage]], [[Grantchester]], which stimulated one of his best-known poems, [[The Old Vicarage, Grantchester|named after the house]], written with homesickness while in Berlin in 1912. While travelling in Europe he prepared a thesis, entitled "[[John Webster]] and the [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan Drama]]", which earned him a Fellowship at [[King's College, Cambridge]] in March 1913.

Brooke suffered a severe emotional crisis in 1912, caused by sexual confusion (he was [[bisexual]])<ref>St. Sukie de la Croix. [https://books.google.com/books?id=44lheqlq-jYC&pg=PA36 ''Chicago Whispers: A History of LGBT Chicago before Stonewall'']. University of Wisconsin Press, 2012, p.36.</ref> and jealousy, resulting in the breakdown of his long relationship with Ka Cox ([[Katherine Laird Cox]]).<ref>{{cite ODNB |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32093?docPos=1 |title=Brooke, Rupert Chawner (1887–1915) |first=Adrian |last=Caesar |year=2004 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/32093 |access-date=12 January 2008}}</ref> Brooke's paranoia that [[Lytton Strachey]] had schemed to destroy his relationship with Cox by encouraging her to see [[Henry Lamb]] precipitated his break with his Bloomsbury group friends and played a part in his [[nervous breakdown|nervous collapse]] and subsequent rehabilitation trips to Germany.<ref>Keith Hale, ed. ''Friends and Apostles: The Correspondence of Rupert Brooke-James Strachey, 1905–1914''.</ref>

As part of his recuperation, Brooke toured the United States and Canada to write travel diaries for the ''[[Westminster Gazette]]''. He took the long way home, sailing across the Pacific and staying some months in the [[South Sea Islands|South Seas]]. Much later it was revealed that he may have fathered a daughter with a Tahitian woman named Taatamata with whom he seems to have enjoyed his most complete emotional relationship.<ref>Mike Read: ''Forever England'' (1997)</ref><ref name="Potter">{{cite web|last1=Potter|first1=Caroline|title=This Side of Paradise: Rupert Brooke and the South Seas|url=http://asketchofthepast.com/2014/08/08/this-side-of-paradise-rupert-brooke-and-the-south-seas/|website=asketchofthepast.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210171436/http://asketchofthepast.com/2014/08/08/this-side-of-paradise-rupert-brooke-and-the-south-seas/|archive-date=10 February 2015|url-status=live|date=8 August 2014}}</ref> Many more people were in love with him.<ref>Biography at [http://www.glbtq.com/literature/brooke_r.html GLBTQ encyclopaedia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515160818/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/brooke_r.html |date=15 May 2008 }} by Keith Hale, editor of ''Friends and Apostles: The Correspondence of Rupert Brooke-James Strachey, 1905–1914''</ref> Brooke was romantically involved with the artist [[Phyllis Gardner]] and the actress [[Cathleen Nesbitt]], and was once engaged to [[Noël Olivier]], whom he met, when she was aged 15, at the progressive [[Bedales School]].

Brooke enlisted at the outbreak of war in August 1914. He came to public attention as a war poet early the following year, when ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' published two sonnets ("IV: The Dead" and "V: The Soldier") on 11 March; the latter was then read from the pulpit of [[St Paul's Cathedral]] on Easter Sunday (4 April).  Brooke's most famous collection of poetry, containing all five sonnets, ''1914 & Other Poems'', was first published in May 1915 and, in testament to his popularity, ran to 11 further impressions that year and by June 1918 had reached its 24th impression;<ref>''1914 & Other Poems'' by Rupert Brooke, Sidgwick & Jackson, 1918 (24th impression).</ref> a process undoubtedly fuelled through posthumous interest.

Brooke's accomplished poetry gained many enthusiasts and followers, and he was taken up by [[Edward Marsh (polymath)|Edward Marsh]], who brought him to the attention of [[Winston Churchill]], then [[First Lord of the Admiralty]]. Brooke was commissioned into the [[Royal Naval Reserve|Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]] as a temporary [[sub-lieutenant]]<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=28906|page=7396|date=18 September 1914}}</ref> shortly after his 27th birthday and took part in the [[British 63rd (Royal Naval) Division|Royal Naval Division's]] [[Antwerp expedition]] in October 1914.

==Death==
[[File:Skyros - 2013-03 - Plateia Brook.JPG|thumb|Brooke Square, Skyros]]

Brooke sailed with the British [[Mediterranean Expeditionary Force]] on 28 February 1915 but developed pneumococcal [[sepsis]] from an infected mosquito bite. French surgeons carried out two operations to drain the abscess but he died of septicaemia at 4:46&nbsp;pm on 23 April 1915, on the French [[hospital ship]] ''[[French ship Duguay-Trouin (1900)|Duguay-Trouin]]'', moored in a bay off the Greek island of [[Skyros]] in the Aegean Sea, while on his way to the [[Gallipoli campaign#Landings|landings at Gallipoli]]. As the expeditionary force had orders to depart immediately, Brooke was buried at 11&nbsp;pm in an olive grove on Skyros.<ref name=TNA1>{{cite web |url= http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/dol/popups/rndofficer1.htm |title=Royal Naval Division service record (extract) |publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] |access-date=11 November 2007}}</ref><ref name=Julian/><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/dol/popups/rndofficer2.htm |title=Royal Naval Division service record (extract) |publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] |access-date=11 November 2007}}</ref> The site was chosen by his close friend, [[William Denis Browne]], who wrote of Brooke's death:<ref name=Musicweb>{{cite web |url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2002/May02/WDBrown.htm |title=William Denis Browne (1888–1915) |first=Pamela |last=Blevins |work=Musicweb International|year=2000|access-date=9 November 2007}}</ref>

On 11 November 1985, Brooke was among 16 First World War poets commemorated on a slate monument unveiled in [[Poets' Corner]] in [[Westminster Abbey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://net.lib.byu.edu/english/wwi/poets/poets.html |title=Poets |publisher=Net.lib.byu.edu |access-date=24 March 2012}}</ref> The inscription on the stone was written by a fellow war poet, [[Wilfred Owen]].

The wooden cross that marked Brooke's grave on Skyros, which was painted and carved with his name, was removed when a permanent memorial was made there. His mother, Mary Ruth Brooke, had the cross brought to Rugby, to the family plot at Clifton Road Cemetery. Because of erosion in the open air, it was removed from the cemetery in 2008 and replaced by a more permanent marker. The Skyros cross is now at Rugby School with the memorials of other Old Rugbeians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyadvertiser.co.uk/news/features/help-to-design-memorial-to-rupert-brooke-1-1482332 | title = Help to design memorial to Rupert Brooke}}</ref>

Brooke's surviving brother, William Alfred Cotterill Brooke, fell in action on the [[Western Front (World War One)|Western Front]] on 14 June 1915 as a [[Subaltern (military)|subaltern]] with the 1/8th (City of London) of the London Regiment ([[Post Office Rifles]]), at the age of 24 years. He had been in France on active service for nineteen days before meeting his death. His body was buried in Fosse 7 Military Cemetery (Quality Street), [[Mazingarbe]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.1914-18.co.uk/brooke/brookes%20brother%20text.htm |title=RUPERT BROOKE |publisher=1914–18.co.uk}}</ref>

In July 1917 Field Marshal [[Edmund Allenby]] was informed of the death in action of his son Michael Allenby, leading to Allenby's break down in tears in public while he recited a poem by Rupert Brooke.

However, in 1919, [[Lord Alfred Douglas]] (in the afterword of his ''Collected Poems'') wrote: "... never before in the history of English literature has poetry sunk so low. When a nation which has produced Shakespeare and Marlowe and Chaucer and Milton and Shelley and Wordsworth and Byron and Keats and Tennyson and Blake can seriously lash itself into enthusiasm over the puerile crudities (when they are nothing worse) of a Rupert Brooke, it simply means that poetry is despised and dishonoured and that sane criticism is dead or moribund."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Douglas |first1=Alfred Bruce |title=The Collected Poems of Lord Alfred Douglas |date=1919 |publisher=Martin Secker |location=London |page=117 |url=https://archive.org/details/collectedpoemsof00doug/page/116/mode/2up}}</ref>
