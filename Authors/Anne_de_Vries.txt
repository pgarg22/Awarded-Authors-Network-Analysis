{{short description|Dutch teacher and author}}
'''Anne de Vries''' (22 May 1904 – 29 November 1964) was a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[teacher]] and [[author]], particularly famous in the [[Netherlands]] for his [[novels]] of regional life. 

Born in the village of Kloosterveen near [[Assen]], de Vries married Alida Gerdina van Wermeskerken in 1930 and the couple had five children. In 1972, de Vries gained national recognition when his novel ''[[Bartje]]'' was made into a television series by [[Willy van Hemert]]. The personnage of Bartje subsequently came to symbolize the Dutch province of [[Drenthe]].

De Vries wrote a number of regional novels, most famously the coming-of-age novel ''Bartje'' and then ''Bartje Seeks Happiness''. He also wrote ''[[Journey Through the Night|Journey through the Night]]'', a children's book about [[World War II]] which was published in four volumes between 1951 and 1958. His Bartje books may be considered ''[[Bildungsroman]]e''.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120530031041/http://www.refdag.nl/artikel/1467247/Anne+de+Vries+was+dol+op+bruine+bonen.html Biografie Anne de Vries verschenen 2010]</ref>
