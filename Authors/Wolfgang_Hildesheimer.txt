'''Wolfgang Hildesheimer''' (9 December 1916 – 21 August 1991) was a German author who incorporated the [[Theatre of the Absurd]]. He originally trained as an artist, before turning to writing.

==Biography==
Hildesheimer was born of Jewish parents in [[Hamburg]]. His grandfather was [[Azriel Hildesheimer]], the moderniser of [[Orthodox Judaism]] in Germany.<ref>{{cite book |title=Freud in Zion |first=Eran J. |last=Rolnik |publisher=Karnak |location=London |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-78049-053-3 |page=113 |orig-year=2007 in Hebrew}}</ref> He was educated at the ''[[Humanistisches Gymnasium]]'' in [[Mannheim]] ({{ill|Karl-Friedrich-Gymnasium Mannheim|de|lt=Karl-Friedrich-Gymnasium}}) from 1926 to 1930. He then attended [[Odenwaldschule]] until 1933, when he left Germany. He was then educated at [[Frensham Heights School]] in Surrey, England. He studied carpentry in [[Mandatory Palestine]], where his parents had emigrated, and underwent [[psychoanalysis]] in [[Jerusalem]]. He studied painting and stage building in London.

In 1946 he worked as a translator and clerk at the [[Nuremberg trials]]. Afterward, he worked as a writer and was a member of [[Group 47]]. In 1980, he gave the inaugural address at the [[Salzburg Festival]], "Was sagt Musik aus?" (What does music say?).<ref>[http://www.suhrkamp.de/autoren/wolfgang_hildesheimer_1977.html Brief biography], [[Suhrkamp]]/Insel. Retrieved 13 October 2011 {{in lang|de}}</ref> In addition to writing, Hildesheimer created [[collage]]s which he collected in several volumes (the first ''Endlich allein'', 1984), an activity he shared with other late-20th century writers [[Peter Weiss]] and [[Ror Wolf]]. The municipality of [[Poschiavo]] in Switzerland made Hildesheimer an [[honorary citizen]] in 1982; he died there in 1991.
