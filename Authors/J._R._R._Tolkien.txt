'''John Ronald Reuel Tolkien''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|CBE|FRSL}} ({{IPAc-en|'|r|uː|l|_|ˈ|t|ɒ|l|k|iː|n}};{{efn|Tolkien pronounced his surname {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɒ|l|k|iː|n}}.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Return of the Shadow: The History of The Lord of the Rings, Part One |year=1988 |isbn=0-04-440162-0 |editor-last=Tolkien |editor-first=Christopher |editor-link=Christopher Tolkien |series=The History of Middle-earth |volume=6}}</ref>{{page needed|date=March 2019}} In [[General American]] the surname is commonly pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|oʊ|l|k|iː|n}}.<ref>{{cite LPD|3}}</ref>}} 3 January 1892 – 2 September 1973) was an English writer, poet, [[philology|philologist]], and academic, best known as the author of the [[high fantasy]] works ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

He served as the [[Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon]] and [[Fellow (Oxbridge)|Fellow]] of [[Pembroke College, Oxford]] from 1925 to 1945 and the [[Merton Professors|Merton Professor of English Language and Literature]] and Fellow of [[Merton College, Oxford]] from 1945 to 1959. He was a close friend of [[C. S. Lewis]], a co-member of the informal literary discussion group [[The Inklings]]. Tolkien was appointed a [[Order of the British Empire|Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] on 28 March 1972.

After Tolkien's death, his son [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher]] published a series of works based on his father's extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts, including ''[[The Silmarillion]]''. These, together with ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'', form a connected body of tales, [[Poetry in The Lord of the Rings|poems]], fictional histories, [[Artistic language|invented languages]], and literary essays about a fantasy world called [[Arda (Middle-earth)|Arda]] and, within it, [[Middle-earth]].{{efn|"Middle-earth" is derived via Middle English ''{{lang|enm|middel-erthe, middel-erd}}'' from ''{{lang|ang|middangeard}}'', an Anglo-Saxon cognate of Old Norse {{lang|non|[[Midgard|Miðgarðr]]}}, the land inhabited by humans in [[Norse mythology]].}} Between 1951 and 1955, Tolkien applied the term ''[[Tolkien's legendarium|legendarium]]'' to the larger part of these writings. 

While many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien, the great success of ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' led directly to [[works inspired by J. R. R. Tolkien|a popular resurgence of the genre]]. This has caused Tolkien to be popularly identified as the "father" of modern fantasy literature—or, more precisely, of high fantasy.

== Biography ==

=== Ancestry ===

{{main|Tolkien family}}

Tolkien's immediate paternal ancestors were middle-class craftsmen who made and sold clocks, watches and pianos in [[London]] and [[Birmingham]]. The Tolkien family originated in the [[East Prussia]]n town [[Kreuzburg, East Prussia|Kreuzburg]] near [[Königsberg]], which was founded during medieval [[German eastward expansion]], where his earliest-known paternal ancestor Michel Tolkien was born around 1620. Michel's son Christianus Tolkien (1663–1746) was a wealthy miller in Kreuzburg. His son Christian Tolkien (1706–1791) moved from Kreuzburg to nearby [[Gdańsk|Danzig]], and his two sons Daniel Gottlieb Tolkien (1747–1813) and Johann (later known as John) Benjamin Tolkien (1752–1819) emigrated to London in the 1770s and became the ancestors of the English family; the younger brother was J. R. R. Tolkien's second great-grandfather. In 1792 John Benjamin Tolkien and William Gravell took over the Erdley Norton manufacture in London, which from then on sold clocks and watches under the name Gravell & Tolkien. Daniel Gottlieb obtained British citizenship in 1794, but John Benjamin apparently never became a British citizen. Other German relatives also joined the two brothers in London. Several people with the surname Tolkien or similar spelling, some of them members of the same family as J. R. R. Tolkien, live in northern Germany, but most of them are descendants of people who [[Evacuation of East Prussia|evacuated East Prussia]] in 1945, at the end of [[World War II]].<ref name="Derdziński1">Ryszard Derdziński, [https://depot.ceon.pl/bitstream/handle/123456789/15041/Z%20Prus%20do%20Anglii.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y Z Prus do Anglii.

According to Ryszard Derdziński, the Tolkien name is of [[Low Prussian dialect|Low Prussian]] origin and probably means "son/descendant of Tolk".<ref name="Derdziński1" /><ref name="Derdziński2" /> Tolkien mistakenly believed his surname derived from the German word {{lang|de|tollkühn}}, meaning "foolhardy",<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=25 August 1969 |title=Ash nazg gimbatul |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45548112.html |magazine=[[Der Spiegel]] |language=de |issue=35/1969 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427035821/http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45548112.html |archive-date=27 April 2011 |quote=Professor Tolkien, der seinen Namen vom deutschen Wort 'tollkühn' ableitet,... . |url-status=live}}</ref> and jokingly inserted himself as a "cameo" into ''[[The Notion Club Papers]]'' under the literally translated name Rashbold.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Geier |first=Fabian |title=J.

=== Childhood ===
[[File:Mabel Suffield Christmas Card.jpg|thumb|right|1892 Christmas card with a coloured photo of the Tolkien family in Bloemfontein, sent to relatives in Birmingham, England]]

John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was born on 3 January 1892 in [[Bloemfontein]] in the [[Orange Free State]] (later [[Treaty of Vereeniging|annexed]] by the [[British Empire]]; now [[Free State Province]] in the Republic of South Africa), to [[Arthur Tolkien|Arthur Reuel Tolkien]] (1857–1896), an English bank manager, and his wife Mabel, ''née'' Suffield (1870–1904). The couple had left England when Arthur was promoted to head the Bloemfontein office of the British bank for which he worked. Tolkien had one sibling, his younger brother, [[Tolkien family#Hilary Tolkien|Hilary Arthur Reuel Tolkien]], who was born on 17 February 1894.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1977|p=14}}</ref>

As a child, Tolkien was bitten by a large [[Harpactirinae|baboon spider]] in the garden, an event some think later echoed in his stories, although he admitted no actual memory of the event and no special hatred of spiders as an adult. In an earlier incident from Tolkien's infancy, a young family servant took the baby to his homestead, returning him the next morning.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1977|p=13}} Both the spider incident and the visit to the homestead are covered here.</ref>

When he was three, he went to England with his mother and brother on what was intended to be a lengthy family visit. His father, however, died in South Africa of [[rheumatic fever]] before he could join them.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1977|p=24}}</ref> This left the family without an income, so Tolkien's mother took him to live with her parents in [[Kings Heath]],<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1977|loc=Ch I, "Bloemfontein". At 9 Ashfield Road, King's Heath.}}</ref> Birmingham. Soon after, in 1896, they moved to [[Sarehole]] (now in [[Hall Green]]), then a [[Worcestershire]] village, later annexed to Birmingham.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1977|p=27}}</ref> He enjoyed exploring [[Sarehole Mill]] and [[Moseley Bog]] and the [[Clent Hills|Clent]], [[Lickey Hills|Lickey]] and [[Malvern Hills]], which would later inspire scenes in his books, along with nearby towns and villages such as [[Bromsgrove]], [[Alcester]], and [[Alvechurch]] and places such as his aunt Jane's farm Bag End, the name of which he used in his fiction.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1977|p=113}}</ref>

[[File:BirminghamOratoryDome.jpg|thumb|right|[[Birmingham Oratory]], where Tolkien was a parishioner and altar boy (1902–1911)]]

Mabel Tolkien taught her two children at home. Ronald, as he was known in the family, was a keen pupil.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1977|p=29}}</ref> She taught him a great deal of [[botany]] and awakened in him the enjoyment of the look and feel of plants. Young Tolkien liked to draw landscapes and trees, but his favourite lessons were those concerning languages, and his mother taught him the rudiments of [[Latin]] very early.<ref name="DoughanBio">{{Cite web |last=Doughan |first=David |year=2002 |title=JRR Tolkien Biography |url=http://www.tolkiensociety.org/tolkien/biography.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060303050751/http://www.tolkiensociety.org/tolkien/biography.html |archive-date=3 March 2006 |website=Life of Tolkien}}</ref>

Tolkien could read by the age of four and could write fluently soon afterwards. His mother allowed him to read many books. He disliked ''[[Treasure Island]]'' and "[[The Pied Piper]]" and thought ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' by [[Lewis Carroll]] was "amusing but disturbing". He liked stories about [[Native Americans in the United States|"Red Indians"]] (Native Americans) and works of fantasy by [[George MacDonald]].<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1977|p=22}}</ref> In addition, the "Fairy Books" of [[Andrew Lang]] were particularly important to him and their influence is apparent in some of his later writings.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1977|p=30}}</ref>

[[File:KES Free Grammar School Charles Barry.jpg|thumb|right|King Edward's School in Birmingham, where Tolkien was a pupil (1900–1902, 1903–1911)<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1977|pp=24–51}}</ref>]]

Mabel Tolkien was received into the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in 1900 despite vehement protests by her [[Baptist]] family,<ref name="Biography31">{{harvnb|Carpenter|1977|p=31}}</ref> which stopped all financial assistance to her. In 1904, when J. R. R. Tolkien was 12, his mother died of [[diabetic ketoacidosis|acute diabetes]] at Fern Cottage in [[Rednal]], which she was renting. She was then about 34 years of age, about as old as a person with [[diabetes mellitus type 1]] could survive without treatment—[[insulin]] would not be discovered until two decades later. Nine years after her death, Tolkien wrote, "My own dear mother was a martyr indeed, and it is not to everybody that God grants so easy a way to his great gifts as he did to Hilary and myself, giving us a mother who killed herself with labour and trouble to ensure us keeping the faith."<ref name=Biography31 />

Before her death, Mabel Tolkien had assigned the guardianship of her sons to her close friend, Father Francis Xavier Morgan of the [[Birmingham Oratory]], who was assigned to bring them up as good Catholics.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1977|p=39<!--pp=34-57 passim.-->}}</ref> In a 1965 letter to his son Michael, Tolkien recalled the influence of the man whom he always called "Father Francis": "He was an upper-class Welsh-Spaniard Tory, and seemed to some just a pottering old gossip. He was—and he was ''not''. I first learned charity and forgiveness from him; and in the light of it pierced even the 'liberal' darkness out of which I came, knowing more about '[[Mary I of England|Bloody Mary]]' than the [[Mother of Jesus]]—who was never mentioned except as an object of wicked worship by the Romanists."<ref group=T>{{harvnb|Carpenter|Tolkien|1981|loc=''Letters'' #267.}}</ref> After his mother's death, Tolkien grew up in the [[Edgbaston]] area of Birmingham and attended [[King Edward's School, Birmingham]], and later [[St Philip's School]]. In 1903, he won a Foundation Scholarship and returned to King Edward's.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1977|pp=25–38}}</ref>

=== Youth ===

While in his early teens, Tolkien had his first encounter with a [[constructed language]], Animalic, an invention of his cousins, Mary and [[Marjorie Incledon]]. At that time, he was studying Latin and Anglo-Saxon. Their interest in Animalic soon died away, but Mary and others, including Tolkien himself, invented a new and more complex language called Nevbosh. The next constructed language he came to work with, Naffarin, would be his own creation.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Tolkien's Not-So-Secret Vice |url=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/vice.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122010424/http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/vice.htm |archive-date=22 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Tolkien's Languages |url=http://lordfingulfin.webs.com/earlierlanguages.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224110153/http://lordfingulfin.webs.com/earlierlanguages.htm |archive-date=24 December 2013}}</ref> Tolkien learned [[Esperanto]] some time before 1909.

In 1911, while they were at King Edward's School, Tolkien and three friends, Rob Gilson, Geoffrey Bache Smith and Christopher Wiseman, formed a semi-secret society they called the T.C.B.S. The initials stood for Tea Club and Barrovian Society, alluding to their fondness for drinking tea in [[Barrows (department store)|Barrow's Stores]] near the school and, secretly, in the school library.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1977|pp=53–54}}</ref><ref>''[[Tolkien and the Great War]]'', p. 6.</ref> After leaving school, the members stayed in touch and, in December 1914, they held a "council" in London at Wiseman's home. For Tolkien, the result of this meeting was a strong dedication to writing poetry.

In 1911, Tolkien went on a summer holiday in Switzerland, a trip that he recollects vividly in a 1968 letter,<ref name=Letters306 group=T>{{harvnb|Carpenter|Tolkien|1981|loc=''Letters'' #306 to Michael Tolkien, 1967 or 1968}}</ref> noting that [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]]'s journey across the [[Misty Mountains]] ("including the glissade down the slithering stones into the pine woods") is directly based on his adventures as their party of 12 hiked from [[Interlaken]] to [[Lauterbrunnen]] and on to camp in the [[moraine]]s <!-- Tolkien spells "morains", but this is not a direct quote. Oxford English Dictionary offers standardized spelling of "moraines".--> beyond [[Mürren]]. Fifty-seven years later, Tolkien remembered his regret at leaving the view of the eternal snows of [[Jungfrau]] and [[Silberhorn]], "the Silvertine ([[Celebdil]]) of my dreams". They went across the [[Kleine Scheidegg]] to [[Grindelwald]] and on across the [[Grosse Scheidegg]] to [[Meiringen]]. They continued across the [[Grimsel Pass]], through the upper [[Valais]] to [[Brig, Switzerland|Brig]] and on to the [[Aletsch glacier]] and [[Zermatt]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=1911 – J. R. R.

In October of the same year, Tolkien began studying at [[Exeter College, Oxford]]. He initially studied [[classics]] but changed his course in 1913 to English language and [[English literature|literature]], graduating in 1915 with [[first-class honours]].<ref name="RoyalMail">{{Cite book |last1=Hammond |first1=Wayne G. |author-link=Wayne G.

=== Courtship and marriage ===

At the age of 16, Tolkien met [[Edith Tolkien|Edith Mary Bratt]], who was three years his senior, when he and his brother Hilary moved into the boarding house where she lived in Duchess Road, [[Edgbaston]]. According to Humphrey Carpenter, "Edith and Ronald took to frequenting Birmingham teashops, especially one which had a balcony overlooking the pavement. There they would sit and throw sugarlumps into the hats of passers-by, moving to the next table when the sugar bowl was empty. ... With two people of their personalities and in their position, romance was bound to flourish. Both were orphans in need of affection, and they found that they could give it to each other. During the summer of 1909, they decided that they were in love."<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1977|p=40}}</ref>

His guardian, Father Morgan, considered it "altogether unfortunate"<ref name="Letters, No. 43" group=T>{{harvnb|Carpenter|Tolkien|1981|loc=''Letters'' #43 to Michael Tolkien, 6–8 March 1941}}</ref> that his surrogate son was romantically involved with an older, [[Church of England|Protestant]] woman; Tolkien wrote that the combined tensions contributed to his having "muffed [his] exams".<ref name="Letters, No. 43" group=T/> Morgan prohibited him from meeting, talking to, or even corresponding with Edith until he was 21. Tolkien obeyed this prohibition to the letter,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Doughan |first=David |year=2002 |title=War, Lost Tales and Academia |url=http://www.tolkiensociety.org/tolkien/biography.html#2 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060303050751/http://www.tolkiensociety.org/tolkien/biography.html |archive-date=3 March 2006 |website=J. R. R. Tolkien: A Biographical Sketch}}</ref> with one notable early exception, over which Father Morgan threatened to cut short his university career if he did not stop.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1977|p=43}}</ref>

On the evening of his 21st birthday, Tolkien wrote to Edith, who was living with family friend C. H. Jessop at [[Cheltenham]]. He declared that he had never ceased to love her, and asked her to marry him. Edith replied that she had already accepted the proposal of George Field, the brother of one of her closest school friends. But Edith said she had agreed to marry Field only because she felt "on the shelf" and had begun to doubt that Tolkien still cared for her. She explained that, because of Tolkien's letter, everything had changed.<ref name="Carpenter 1977 p67"/>

On 8 January 1913, Tolkien travelled by train to Cheltenham and was met on the platform by Edith. The two took a walk into the countryside, sat under a railway viaduct, and talked. By the end of the day, Edith had agreed to accept Tolkien's proposal. She wrote to Field and returned her engagement ring. Field was "dreadfully upset at first", and the Field family was "insulted and angry".<ref name="Carpenter 1977 p67">{{harvnb|Carpenter|1977|pp=67–69}}</ref> Upon learning of Edith's new plans, Jessop wrote to her guardian, "I have nothing to say against Tolkien, he is a cultured gentleman, but his prospects are poor in the extreme, and when he will be in a position to marry I cannot imagine. Had he adopted a profession it would have been different."<ref>''The Tolkien Family Album'', (1992), p. 34.</ref>

Following their engagement, Edith reluctantly announced that she was converting to Catholicism at Tolkien's insistence. Jessop, "like many others of his age and class ... strongly [[Anti-Catholicism in the United Kingdom|anti-Catholic]]", was infuriated, and he ordered Edith to find other lodgings.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1977|p=73}}</ref>

Edith Bratt and Ronald Tolkien were formally engaged at Birmingham in January 1913, and married at [[St Mary Immaculate Roman Catholic Church, Warwick]], on 22 March 1916.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1977|p=86}}</ref> In his 1941 letter to Michael, Tolkien expressed admiration for his wife's willingness to marry a man with no job, little money, and no prospects except the likelihood of being killed in the Great War.<ref name="Letters, No. 43" group=T/>

In August 1914, Britain entered the [[First World War]]. Tolkien's relatives were shocked when he elected not to volunteer immediately for the [[British Army]].

==== France ====

On 5 June 1916, Tolkien boarded a troop transport for an overnight voyage to [[Calais]]. Like other soldiers arriving for the first time, he was sent to the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]]'s (BEF) base depot at [[Étaples]]. On 7 June, he was informed that he had been assigned as a signals officer to the 11th (Service) Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers. The battalion was part of the [[74th Brigade (United Kingdom)|74th Brigade]], [[25th Division (United Kingdom)|25th Division]]. While waiting to be summoned to his unit, Tolkien sank into boredom. To pass the time, he composed a poem entitled ''The Lonely Isle'', which was inspired by his feelings during the sea crossing to Calais. To evade the British Army's [[postal censorship]], he developed a code of dots by which Edith could track his movements.<ref name="Garth144">{{harvnb|Garth|2003|pp=144–145}}</ref> He left Étaples on 27 June 1916 and joined his battalion at [[Rubempré]], near [[Amiens]].<ref>{{harvnb|Garth|2003|pp=147–148}}</ref> He found himself commanding enlisted men who were drawn mainly from the mining, milling, and weaving towns of Lancashire.<ref>{{harvnb|Garth|2003|pp=148–149}}</ref> According to [[John Garth (author)|John Garth]], he "felt an affinity for these working class men", but military protocol prohibited friendships with "[[Other ranks (UK)|other ranks]]".

==== Battle of the Somme ====
[[File: Schwaben Redoubt by William Orpen IWM Art.IWM ART 3000.jpg|thumb|right|'' The Schwaben Redoubt'', painting by William Orpen. [[Imperial War Museum]], London]]

Tolkien arrived at the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]] in early July 1916. In between terms behind the lines at [[Bouzincourt]], he participated in the assaults on the [[Schwaben Redoubt]] and the [[Leipzig salient]]. Tolkien's time in combat was a terrible stress for Edith, who feared that every knock on the door might carry news of her husband's death. Edith could track her husband's movements on a map of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. The Reverend Mervyn S. Evers, [[Anglican]] chaplain to the Lancashire Fusiliers, recorded that Tolkien and his brother officers were eaten by "hordes of lice" which found the Medical Officer's ointment merely "a kind of ''[[hors d'oeuvre]]'' and the little beggars went at their feast with renewed vigour."<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb|Garth|2003|p=200}}</ref> On 27 October 1916, as his battalion attacked [[Regina Trench]], Tolkien contracted [[trench fever]], a disease carried by [[lice]]. He was invalided to England on 8 November 1916.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1977|p=93}}</ref> Many of his dearest school friends were killed in the war. Among their number were Rob Gilson of the Tea Club and Barrovian Society, who was killed on the [[first day of the Somme]] while leading his men in the assault on [[Beaumont Hamel]]. Fellow T.C.B.S. member Geoffrey Smith was killed during the battle, when a German artillery shell landed on a first-aid post. Tolkien's battalion was almost completely wiped out following his return to England.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1977|pp=93, 103, 105}}</ref>

According to John Garth, [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Kitchener]]'s [[Kitchener's Army|army]] at once marked existing social boundaries and counteracted the class system by throwing everyone into a desperate situation together. Tolkien was grateful, writing that it had taught him "a deep sympathy and feeling for the [[Tommy Atkins|Tommy]]; especially the plain soldier from the agricultural counties".<ref>{{harvnb|Garth|2003|pp=94–95}}</ref>

In 1925, he returned to Oxford as [[Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon]], with a fellowship at [[Pembroke College, Oxford|Pembroke College]].

In mid-1919, he began to tutor undergraduates privately, most importantly those of [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford|Lady Margaret Hall]] and [[St Hugh's College, Oxford|St Hugh's College]], given that the women's colleges were in great need of good teachers in their early years, and Tolkien as a married professor (then still not common) was considered suitable, as a bachelor don would not have been.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Zettersten |first=A. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Q_GAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA134 |title=J.

During his time at [[Pembroke College, Oxford|Pembroke College]] Tolkien wrote ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and the first two volumes of ''The Lord of the Rings'', while living at 20 [[Northmoor Road]] in [[North Oxford]]. He also published a philological essay in 1932 on the name "[[Nodens]]", following Sir [[Mortimer Wheeler]]'s unearthing of a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Asclepeion]] at [[Lydney Park]], Gloucestershire, in 1928.<ref>See ''The Name Nodens'' (1932) in the bibliographical listing. For the etymology, see [[Nodens#Etymology]].</ref>

==== ''Beowulf'' ====
{{further|Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary|On Translating Beowulf}}

In the 1920s, Tolkien undertook a translation of ''[[Beowulf]]'', which he finished in 1926, but did not publish. It was finally edited by his son and published in 2014, more than 40 years after Tolkien's death and almost 90 years after its completion.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Acocella |first=Joan |date=2 June 2014 |title=Slaying Monsters: Tolkien's 'Beowulf' |url=https://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2014/06/02/140602crbo_books_acocella?currentPage=all |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530222018/http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2014/06/02/140602crbo_books_acocella?currentPage=all |archive-date=30 May 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Ten years after finishing his translation, Tolkien gave a highly acclaimed lecture on the work, "[[Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics|''Beowulf'': The Monsters and the Critics]]", which had a lasting influence on ''Beowulf'' research.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1977|p=143}}</ref> Lewis E. Nicholson said that the article is "widely recognized as a turning point in Beowulfian criticism", noting that Tolkien established the primacy of the poetic nature of the work as opposed to its purely linguistic elements.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ramey |first=Bill |date=30 March 1998 |title=The Unity of Beowulf: Tolkien and the Critics |url=http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/billramey/beowulf.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060421094854/http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/billramey/beowulf.htm |archive-date=21 April 2006 |website=Wisdom's Children}}</ref> At the time, the consensus of scholarship deprecated ''Beowulf'' for dealing with childish battles with monsters rather than realistic tribal warfare; Tolkien argued that the author of ''Beowulf'' was addressing human destiny in general, not as limited by particular tribal politics, and therefore the monsters were essential to the poem.<ref>Tolkien: ''[[Finn and Hengest]]''. Chiefly, p.4 in the Introduction by [[Alan Bliss]].</ref> Where ''Beowulf'' does deal with specific tribal struggles, as at [[Finnsburg]], Tolkien argued firmly against reading in fantastic elements.<ref>Tolkien: ''[[Finn and Hengest]]'', the discussion of ''Eotena'', ''passim''.</ref> In the essay, Tolkien also revealed how highly he regarded ''Beowulf'': "Beowulf is among my most valued sources"; [[Beowulf and Middle-earth|this influence may be seen]] throughout his [[Middle-earth]] [[legendarium]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kennedy |first=Michael |year=2001 |title=Tolkien and Beowulf&nbsp;– Warriors of Middle-earth |url=http://www.triode.net.au/~dragon/tilkal/issue1/beowulf.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509110607/http://www.triode.net.au/~dragon/tilkal/issue1/beowulf.html |archive-date=9 May 2006 |website=Amon Hen}}</ref>

According to [[Humphrey Carpenter]], Tolkien began his series of lectures on ''Beowulf'' in a most striking way, entering the room silently, fixing the audience with a look, and suddenly declaiming in Old English the opening lines of the poem, starting "with a great cry of ''[[wikt:hwæt|Hwæt]]!''" It was a dramatic impersonation of an Anglo-Saxon bard in a mead hall, and it made the students realize that ''Beowulf'' was not just a set text but "a powerful piece of dramatic poetry".<ref name="Biog p133">{{harvnb|Carpenter|1977|p=133}}</ref> Decades later, [[W. H. Auden]] wrote to his former professor, thanking him for the "unforgettable experience" of hearing him recite ''Beowulf'', and stating "The voice was the voice of [[Gandalf]]".<ref name="Biog p133"/>

=== Retirement ===
[[File:Oxford Tolkien.JPG|thumb|upright|Bust of Tolkien in the chapel of [[Exeter College, Oxford]]]]

During his life in retirement, from 1959 up to his death in 1973, Tolkien received steadily increasing public attention and literary fame. In 1961, his friend [[C. S. Lewis]] even nominated him for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Nomination Database |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show.php?id=16784 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421094448/http://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show.php?id=16784 |archive-date=21 April 2017 |publisher=Nobel Foundation}}</ref> The sales of his books were so profitable that he regretted that he had not chosen early retirement.<ref name=DoughanBio /> In a 1972 letter, he deplored having become a [[Tolkien fandom|cult-figure]], but admitted that "even the nose of a very modest idol ... cannot remain entirely untickled by the sweet smell of incense!"<ref group="T">{{harvnb|Carpenter|Tolkien|1981|loc=''Letters'' #336 to [[Patrick Browne (judge)|Sir Patrick Browne]], 23 May 1972}}</ref>

Fan attention became so intense that Tolkien had to take his phone number out of the public directory,<ref group=T>{{harvnb|Carpenter|Tolkien|1981|loc=''Letters'' #332 to Michael Tolkien, 24 January 1972}}</ref> and eventually he and Edith moved to [[Bournemouth]], which was then a seaside resort patronized by the British upper middle class. Tolkien's status as a best-selling author gave them easy entry into polite society, but Tolkien deeply missed the company of his fellow [[Inklings]]. Edith, however, was overjoyed to step into the role of a society hostess, which had been the reason that Tolkien selected Bournemouth in the first place. The genuine and deep affection between Ronald and Edith was demonstrated by their care about the other's health, in details like wrapping presents, in the generous way he gave up his life at Oxford so she could retire to Bournemouth, and in her pride in his becoming a famous author. They were tied together, too, by love for their children and grandchildren.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1977|loc=Part 7, Chapter 2 "Bournemouth"}}</ref>

In his retirement Tolkien was a consultant and translator for ''[[The Jerusalem Bible]]'', published in 1966. He was initially assigned a larger portion to translate, but, due to other commitments, only managed to offer some criticisms of other contributors and a translation of the [[Book of Jonah]].<ref group=T>{{harvnb|Carpenter|Tolkien|1981|loc=''Letters'' #294 to Charlotte and Denis Plimmer, 8 February 1967}}</ref>

Tolkien's [[Roman Catholicism]] was a significant factor in [[C. S.

=== Nature ===

During most of his own life [[conservationism]] was not yet on the political agenda, and Tolkien himself did not directly express conservationist views—except in some private letters, in which he tells about his fondness for forests and sadness at tree-felling. In later years, a number of authors of biographies or literary analyses of Tolkien conclude that during his writing of ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien gained increased interest in the value of wild and untamed nature, and in protecting what wild nature was left in the industrialized world.<ref>{{Cite book |title=J.

==== "''Beowulf'': The Monsters and the Critics" ====
{{Main|Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics}}

In addition to writing fiction, Tolkien was an author of academic literary criticism. His seminal 1936 lecture, later published as an article, revolutionized the treatment of the Anglo-Saxon epic ''[[Beowulf]]'' by literary critics. The essay remains highly influential in the study of Old English literature to this day.<ref name=Niles>{{cite book |last1=Niles| author-link=John Niles (scholar) |first1=John D. |editor1-last=Bjork |editor1-first=Robert E. |editor2-last=Niles |editor2-first=John D. |editor-link=John D.

==== "On Fairy-Stories" ====
{{Main|On Fairy-Stories}}
This essay discusses the fairy-story as a literary form. It was initially written as the 1939 Andrew Lang Lecture at the University of St Andrews, Scotland. Tolkien focuses on [[Andrew Lang]]'s work as a folklorist and collector of fairy tales. He disagreed with Lang's broad inclusion, in his [[Lang's Fairy Books|Fairy Book]] collections, of traveller's tales, beast fables, and other types of stories. Tolkien held a narrower perspective, viewing fairy stories as those that took place in [[Fairyland|Faerie]], an enchanted realm, with or without fairies as characters. He viewed them as the natural development of the interaction of human imagination and human language.{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=56–57}}

==== Children's books and other short works ====

In addition to his [[mythopoeia|mythopoeic]] compositions, Tolkien enjoyed inventing fantasy stories to entertain his children.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Phillip |first=Norman |year=2005 |title=The Prevalence of Hobbits |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-mag67.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411062440/http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-mag67.html |archive-date=11 April 2009}}</ref> He wrote annual Christmas letters from [[Father Christmas]] for them, building up a series of short stories (later compiled and published as ''[[The Father Christmas Letters]]'').<ref name=travels>{{cite news |title=Grand Tours: Who Travels the World in a Single Night? |url=https://www.questia.com/read/1P2-1716622/travel-etc-grand-tours-who-travels-the-world-in |access-date=22 November 2012 |newspaper=[[The Independent on Sunday]] |date=22 December 2002 |archive-date=21 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921073323/http://www.questia.com/read/1P2-1716622/travel-etc-grand-tours-who-travels-the-world-in |url-status=live }}</ref> Other works included ''[[Mr. Bliss]]'' and ''[[Roverandom]]'' (for children), and ''[[Leaf by Niggle]]'' (part of ''[[Tree and Leaf]]''), ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'', ''[[Smith of Wootton Major]]'' and ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]''.

==== ''The Hobbit'' ====
{{main|The Hobbit}}

Tolkien never expected his stories to become popular, but by sheer accident a book called ''[[The Hobbit]]'', which he had written some years before for his own children, came in 1936 to the attention of Susan Dagnall, an employee of the London publishing firm [[George Allen & Unwin]], who persuaded Tolkien to submit it for publication.<ref name="NYTimes obit" /> When it was published a year later, the book attracted adult readers as well as children, and it became popular enough for the publishers to ask Tolkien to produce a sequel.<ref>{{ME-ref|DB|pp=8–23}}</ref>

==== ''The Lord of the Rings'' ====
{{main|The Lord of the Rings}}

The request for a sequel prompted Tolkien to begin what became his most famous work: the epic novel ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (originally published in three volumes in 1954–1955). Tolkien spent more than ten years writing the primary narrative and appendices for ''The Lord of the Rings'', during which time he received the constant support of the [[Inklings]], in particular his closest friend [[C.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Lewis]], the author of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]''. Both ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' are set against the background of ''The Silmarillion'', but in a time long after it.<ref name="The New Hobbit">{{harvnb|Carpenter|1977|pp=187–208}}</ref>

Tolkien at first intended ''The Lord of the Rings'' to be a children's tale in the style of ''The Hobbit'', but it quickly grew darker and more serious in the writing.<ref>{{Cite news |date=5 June 1955 |title=Oxford Calling |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-oxford.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411062443/http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-oxford.html |archive-date=11 April 2009}}</ref> Though a direct sequel to ''The Hobbit'', it addressed an older audience, drawing on the immense [[backstory]] of [[Beleriand]] that Tolkien had constructed in previous years, and which eventually saw posthumous publication in ''The Silmarillion'' and other volumes.<ref name="The New Hobbit"/> Tolkien strongly influenced the [[fantasy fiction|fantasy]] genre that grew up after the book's success.<ref>{{cite book |last=Fimi |first=Dimitra |author-link=Dimitra Fimi |chapter=Later Fantasy Fiction: Tolkien's Legacy |editor-last=Lee |editor-first=Stuart D. |editor-link=Stuart D.

==== ''The Silmarillion'' ====

Tolkien wrote a brief "Sketch of the Mythology", which included the tales of Beren and Lúthien and of Túrin; and that sketch eventually evolved into the ''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', an epic history that Tolkien started three times but never published. Tolkien desperately hoped to publish it along with ''The Lord of the Rings'', but publishers (both [[Allen & Unwin]] and [[HarperCollins|Collins]]) declined. Moreover, printing costs were very high in 1950s Britain, requiring ''The Lord of the Rings'' to be published in three volumes.<ref>[[Wayne G. Hammond|Hammond, Wayne G.]] (1993). ''J. R. R. Tolkien: A Descriptive Bibliography'', London: Saint Paul's Biographies, {{ISBN|1-873040-11-3}}, American edition {{ISBN|0-938768-42-5}}</ref> The story of this continuous redrafting is told in the posthumous series ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', edited by Tolkien's son, Christopher Tolkien. From around 1936, Tolkien began to extend this framework to include the tale of ''The Fall of [[Númenor]]'', which was inspired by the legend of [[Atlantis]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Nagy |first=Gergely |author-link=Gergely Nagy (scholar) |chapter='The Silmarillion': Tolkien's Theory of Myth, Text, and Culture |editor-last=Lee |editor-first=Stuart D. |editor-link=Stuart D.

Tolkien appointed his son Christopher to be his [[literary executor]], and he (with assistance from [[Guy Gavriel Kay]], later a well-known fantasy author in his own right) organized some of this material into a single coherent volume, published as ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' in 1977. It received the Locus Award for Best Fantasy novel in 1978.<ref name="WWE-1978">{{Cite web |title=1978 Award Winners & Nominees |url=http://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_year_index.asp?year=1978 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709212409/http://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_year_index.asp?year=1978 |archive-date=9 July 2009 |website=Worlds Without End}}</ref>

==== ''Unfinished Tales'' and ''The History of Middle-earth'' ====

In 1980, Christopher Tolkien published a collection of more fragmentary material, under the title ''[[Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth]]''. In subsequent years (1983–1996), he published a large amount of the remaining unpublished materials, together with notes and extensive commentary, in a series of twelve volumes called ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]''. They contain unfinished, abandoned, alternative, and outright contradictory accounts, since they were always a work in progress for Tolkien and he only rarely settled on a definitive version for any of the stories. There is not complete consistency between ''The Lord of the Rings'' and ''The Hobbit'', the two most closely related works, because Tolkien never fully integrated all their traditions into each other. He commented in 1965, while editing ''The Hobbit'' for a third edition, that he would have preferred to rewrite the book completely because of the style of its prose.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Martinez |first=Michael |date=27 July 2002 |title=Middle-earth Revised, Again |url=http://www.merp.com/essays/MichaelMartinez/michaelmartinezsuite101essay122 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617122627/http://www.merp.com/essays/MichaelMartinez/michaelmartinezsuite101essay122 |archive-date=17 June 2008 |website=Michael Martinez Tolkien Essays}}</ref>

== Languages and philology ==

=== Linguistic career ===

Both Tolkien's academic career and his literary production are inseparable from his love of language and [[philology]]. He specialized in English philology at university and in 1915 graduated with [[Old Norse]] as his special subject. He worked on the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' from 1918 and is credited with having worked on a number of words starting with the letter W, including ''[[walrus]]'', over which he struggled mightily.<ref>[[Winchester, Simon]] (2003). ''[[The Meaning of Everything: The Story of the Oxford English Dictionary]]''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-860702-4}}; and Gilliver, Peter, Jeremy Marshall and Edmund Weiner (2006). ''The Ring of Words: Tolkien and the Oxford English Dictionary''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-861069-6}}.</ref> In 1920, he became Reader in English Language at the [[University of Leeds]], where he claimed credit for raising the number of students of [[linguistics]] from five to twenty. He gave courses in Old English [[heroic verse]], [[history of English]], various [[Old English]] and [[Middle English]] texts, Old and Middle English philology, introductory [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] philology, [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[Old Icelandic]], and [[Middle Welsh language|Medieval Welsh]]. When in 1925, aged thirty-three, Tolkien applied for the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professorship of Anglo-Saxon at [[Pembroke College, Oxford]], he boasted that his students of Germanic philology in Leeds had even formed a "[[Viking revival|Viking Club]]".<ref group=T>{{harvnb|Carpenter|Tolkien|1981|loc=''Letters'' #7, to the Electors of the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professorship of Anglo-Saxon, University of Oxford, 27 June 1925}}</ref> He also had a certain, if imperfect, knowledge of [[Finnish language|Finnish]].<ref>Grotta, Daniel (2001). ''J. R. R. Tolkien: Architect of Middle Earth''. Philadelphia, Running Press. {{ISBN|0-7624-0956-8}}.</ref>

Privately, Tolkien was attracted to "things of [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] and linguistic significance", and in his 1955 lecture ''[[English and Welsh]]'', which is crucial to his understanding of race and language, he entertained notions of "inherent linguistic predilections", which he termed the "native language" as opposed to the "cradle-tongue" which a person first learns to speak.<ref>''English and Welsh'', O'Donnell Lecture, 1955, cited in [[Wayne G. Hammond]] & [[Christina Scull]]: ''The J. R. R. Tolkien Companion and Guide: Reader's Guide'', London, HarperCollins 2006, p. 249.</ref> He considered the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] dialect of Middle English to be his own "native language", and, as he wrote to [[W. H. Auden]] in 1955, "I am a West-midlander by blood (and took to early west-midland Middle English as a known tongue as soon as I set eyes on it)."<ref group=T>{{harvnb|Carpenter|Tolkien|1981|loc=''Letters'' #163.}}</ref>

=== Language construction ===
{{See also|Languages constructed by J. R. R. Tolkien}}

[[File:Quenya Example.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.25|''Ah! like gold fall the leaves in the wind, long years numberless as the wings of trees!'', the beginning of the Quenya poem [[Namárië]] written in [[Tengwar]] and in [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] script]]

Parallel to Tolkien's professional work as a philologist, and sometimes overshadowing this work, to the effect that his academic output remained rather thin, was his affection for [[constructed languages|constructing languages]]. The most developed of these are [[Quenya]] and [[Sindarin]], the etymological connection between which formed the core of much of Tolkien's ''legendarium''. Language and grammar for Tolkien was a matter of [[aesthetics]] and [[euphony]], and Quenya in particular was designed from "phonaesthetic" considerations; it was intended as an "Elven-latin", and was phonologically based on Latin, with ingredients from Finnish, Welsh, English, and Greek.<ref name="letter144" group=T>{{harvnb|Carpenter|Tolkien|1981|loc=''Letters'' #144.}}</ref> A notable addition came in late 1945 with [[Adûnaic]] or [[Númenórean]], a language of a "faintly [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] flavour", connected with Tolkien's [[Atlantis]] legend, which by ''[[The Notion Club Papers]]'' ties directly into his ideas about the inability of language to be inherited, and via the "[[Second Age]]" and the story of [[Eärendil]] was grounded in the ''legendarium'', thereby providing a link of Tolkien's 20th-century "real primary world" with the legendary past of his Middle-earth.

Tolkien considered languages inseparable from the mythology associated with them, and he consequently took a dim view of [[International auxiliary language|auxiliary languages]]: in 1930 a congress of Esperantists were told as much by him, in his lecture ''[[A Secret Vice]]'',<ref>{{Cite web |last=Corsetti |first=Renato |date=31 January 2018 |title=Tolkien's 'Secret Vice' |url=http://blogs.bl.uk/european/2018/01/tolkiens-secret-vice.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180204082940/http://blogs.bl.uk/european/2018/01/tolkiens-secret-vice.html |archive-date=4 February 2018 |website=British Library}}</ref> "Your language construction will breed a mythology", but by 1956 he had concluded that "[[Volapük]], [[Esperanto]], [[Ido (language)|Ido]], [[Novial]], &c, &c, are dead, far deader than ancient unused languages, because their authors never invented any Esperanto legends".<ref name="letter180" group=T>{{harvnb|Carpenter|Tolkien|1981|loc=''Letters'' #180.}}</ref>

The popularity of Tolkien's books has had a small but lasting effect on the use of language in fantasy literature in particular, and even on mainstream dictionaries, which today commonly accept Tolkien's idiosyncratic spellings ''dwarves'' and ''dwarvish'' (alongside ''dwarfs'' and ''dwarfish''), which had been little used since the mid-19th century and earlier. (In fact, according to Tolkien, had the [[Old English]] plural survived, it would have been ''dwarrows'' or ''dwerrows''.) He also coined the term ''[[eucatastrophe]]'', though it remains mainly used in connection with his own work.

== Artwork ==
{{main|Tolkien's artwork}}

Tolkien learnt to paint and draw as a child, and continued to do so all his adult life. From early in his writing career, the development of his stories was accompanied by drawings and paintings, especially of landscapes, and by maps of the lands in which the tales were set. He also produced pictures to accompany the stories told to his own children, including those later published in ''Mr Bliss'' and ''Roverandom'', and sent them elaborately illustrated letters purporting to come from Father Christmas. Although he regarded himself as an amateur, the publisher used the author's own cover art, [[Tolkien's maps|his maps]], and full-page illustrations for the early editions of ''The Hobbit''. He prepared maps and illustrations for ''The Lord of the Rings'', but the first edition contained only the maps, his [[calligraphy]] for the inscription on the One Ring, and his ink drawing of the [[Doors of Durin]]. Much of [[Tolkien's artwork|his artwork]] was collected and published in 1995 as a book: ''[[J. R. R. Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator]]''. The book discusses Tolkien's paintings, drawings, and sketches, and reproduces approximately 200 examples of his work.<ref name="Hammond Scull 1995">{{Cite book |last1=Hammond |first1=Wayne G. |author-link=Wayne G.

In a 1951 letter to publisher Milton Waldman (1895–1976), Tolkien wrote about his intentions to create a "body of more or less connected legend", of which "[t]he cycles should be linked to a majestic whole, and yet leave scope for other minds and hands, wielding paint and music and drama".<ref group=T>{{harvnb|Carpenter|Tolkien|1981|loc=''Letters'' #131}}</ref> The hands and minds of many artists have indeed been inspired by Tolkien's legends. Personally known to him were [[Pauline Baynes]] (Tolkien's favourite illustrator of ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'' and ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]'') and [[Donald Swann]] (who set the music to ''[[The Road Goes Ever On]]''). Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark]] created illustrations to ''The Lord of the Rings'' in the early 1970s. She sent them to Tolkien, who was struck by the similarity they bore in style to his own drawings.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Thygesen |first=Peter |date=Autumn 1999 |title=Queen Margrethe II: Denmark's monarch for a modern age |work=Scandinavian Review |url=https://www.questia.com/read/1P3-46949881 |access-date=12 March 2006 |archive-date=26 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210526123505/https://www.gale.com/databases/questia |url-status=live }}</ref>
Tolkien was not implacably opposed to the idea of a dramatic adaptation, however, and sold the film, stage and merchandise rights of ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' to [[United Artists]] in 1968. United Artists never made a film, although director [[John Boorman]] was planning a live-action film in the early 1970s. In 1976, the rights were sold to [[Tolkien Enterprises]], a division of the [[Saul Zaentz]] Company, and the first film adaptation of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' was released in 1978 as an animated [[rotoscoping]] film directed by [[Ralph Bakshi]] with screenplay by the fantasy writer [[Peter S. Beagle]]. It covered only the first half of the story of ''The Lord of the Rings''.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |date=15 November 1978 |title=Film: 'The Lord of the Rings' From Ralph Bakshi |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-lordfilm.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411062438/http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-lordfilm.html |archive-date=11 April 2009}}</ref> In 1977, an [[animation|animated]] [[musical film|musical]] [[television film]] of ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]'' was made by [[Rankin-Bass]], and in 1980, they produced the animated musical television film ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]'', which covered some of the portions of ''The Lord of the Rings'' that Bakshi was unable to complete.
From 2001 to 2003, [[New Line Cinema]] released ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' as a trilogy of [[live-action]] films that were filmed in New Zealand and directed by [[Peter Jackson]]. The series was successful, performing extremely well commercially and winning numerous [[Academy Awards|Oscars]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=1 March 2004 |title=Rings scores Oscars clean sweep |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3495748.stm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831160410/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3495748.stm |archive-date=31 August 2017}}</ref>
