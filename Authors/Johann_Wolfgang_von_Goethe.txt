Goethe took up residence in [[Weimar]] in November 1775 following the success of his first novel, ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'' (1774). He was [[ennobled]] by the Duke of [[Saxe-Weimar]], [[Karl August, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Karl August]], in 1782. He was an early participant in the ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' literary movement. During his first ten years in Weimar, Goethe became a member of the Duke's [[privy council]], sat on the war and highway commissions, oversaw the reopening of silver mines in nearby [[Ilmenau]], and implemented a series of administrative reforms at the [[University of Jena]]. He also contributed to the planning of Weimar's botanical park and the rebuilding of its [[Schloss Weimar|Ducal Palace]].<ref name=Weimar/>{{efn|In 1998, both of these sites, together with nine others, were designated a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] under the name [[Classical Weimar (World Heritage Site)|Classical Weimar]].<ref name=Weimar>{{cite web|title= Classical Weimar UNESCO Justification|url= https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/846|work= Justification for UNESCO Heritage Cites|publisher= UNESCO|access-date= 7 June 2012}}</ref>}}

Goethe's first major scientific work, the ''[[Metamorphosis of Plants]]'', was published after he returned from a 1788 tour of [[Italy]]. In 1791 he was made managing director of the [[Deutsches Nationaltheater und Staatskapelle Weimar|theatre at Weimar]], and in 1794 he began a friendship with the [[playwright|dramatist]], [[historian]], and [[philosopher]] [[Friedrich Schiller]], whose plays he premiered until Schiller's death in 1805. During this period Goethe published his second novel, ''[[Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship]]''; the verse epic ''[[Hermann and Dorothea]]'', and, in 1808, the first part of his most celebrated drama, ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]''. His conversations and various shared undertakings throughout the 1790s with Schiller, [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], [[Alexander von Humboldt]],<ref name=Daum>{{cite journal|last=Daum|first=Andreas W.|author-link=Andreas Daum|date=March 2019|title=Social Relations, Shared Practices, and Emotions: Alexander von Humboldt's Excursion into Literary Classicism and the Challenges to Science around 1800|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/701757|journal=[[The Journal of Modern History]]|publisher=University of Chicago|volume=91|issue=1|pages=1–37|doi=10.1086/701757|s2cid=151051482}}</ref> [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], and [[August Schlegel|August]] and [[Friedrich Schlegel]] have come to be collectively termed [[Weimar Classicism]].

Goethe's comments and observations form the basis of several biographical works, notably [[Johann Peter Eckermann]]'s ''[[Conversations with Goethe]]'' (1836).

== Life ==
=== Early life ===
Goethe's father, Johann Caspar Goethe, lived with his family in a large house (today the [[Goethe House]]) in [[Frankfurt]], then a [[free imperial city]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Though he had studied [[Jurisprudence|law]] in [[Leipzig]] and had been appointed Imperial Councillor, Johann Caspar Goethe was not involved in the city's official affairs.<ref name=Grimm36>[[Herman Grimm]]: ''Goethe. Vorlesungen gehalten an der Königlichen Universität zu Berlin.'' Vol. 1. J.G. Cotta'sche Buchhandlung Nachfolger, Stuttgart / Berlin 1923, p.&nbsp;36</ref> Johann Caspar married Goethe's mother, [[Catharina Elisabeth Goethe|Catharina Elizabeth Textor]], at Frankfurt on 20 August 1748, when he was 38 and she was 17.<ref>Catharina was the daughter of Johann Wolfgang Textor, sheriff (''[[Schultheiß]]'') of Frankfurt, and of Anna Margaretha Lindheimer.</ref> All their children, with the exception of Johann Wolfgang and his sister Cornelia Friederica Christiana (born in 1750), died at early ages.

[[File:Goethehaus-ffm011.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Goethe House|Goethe's birthplace]] in Frankfurt (Großer Hirschgraben)]]
His father and private tutors gave the young Goethe lessons in common subjects of their time, especially languages ([[Latin]], [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], [[Biblical Hebrew]] (briefly),<ref>{{cite book|last=Kruse|first=Joseph A.|chapter=Poetisch-religiöse Vorratskammer – Die Hebräische Bibel bei Goethe und Heine|page=71|title=Goethe und die Juden – die Juden und Goethe|language=de|editor1=Anna-Dorothea Ludewig|editor2=Steffen Höhne|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2018|isbn=9783110530421}}</ref> French, Italian, and English). Goethe also received lessons in dancing, [[equestrianism|riding]], and [[fencing]]. Johann Caspar, feeling frustrated in his own ambitions, was determined that his children should have all those advantages that he had not.<ref name=Grimm36 />

Although Goethe's great passion was drawing, he quickly became interested in literature; [[Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock]] (1724–1803) and [[Homer]] were among his early favorites.<ref>Oehler, R 1932, "Buch und Bibliotheken unter der Perspektive Goethe – Goethe's attitude toward books and libraries", ''[[The Library Quarterly]]'',  2, pp. 232–249</ref> He had a devotion to theater as well, and was greatly fascinated by [[puppet]] shows that were annually arranged{{by whom?|date=January 2021}} in his home; this became a recurrent theme in his literary work ''[[Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship]]''.

He also took great pleasure in reading works on history and religion. He writes about this period:
{{Quotation|I had from childhood the singular habit of always learning by heart the beginnings of books, and the divisions of a work, first of the [[Torah|five books of Moses]], and then of the ''[[Aeneid]]'' and [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]''. ... If an ever busy imagination, of which that tale may bear witness, led me hither and thither, if the medley of fable and history, mythology and religion, threatened to bewilder me, I readily fled to those oriental regions, plunged into the first books of Moses, and there, amid the scattered shepherd tribes, found myself at once in the greatest solitude and the greatest society.<ref>Goethe, Johann Wolfgang von. ''The Autobiography of Goethe: Truth and Poetry, From My Own Life'', Volume&nbsp;1 (1897), translated by [[John Oxenford]], pp. 114, 129</ref>}}

Goethe also became acquainted with Frankfurt actors.<ref>{{interlanguage link|Valerian Tornius|de}}: ''Goethe – Leben, Wirken und Schaffen''. Ludwig-Röhrscheid-Verlag, Bonn 1949, p.&nbsp;26</ref> In early literary attempts he showed an infatuation with ''Gretchen'', who would later reappear in his [[Goethe's Faust|''Faust'']], and the adventures with whom he would concisely describe in ''[[Dichtung und Wahrheit]]''.<ref>[[Emil Ludwig]]: ''Goethe – Geschichte eines Menschen.''

=== Legal career ===
[[File:Annakatharinaschoenkopf.png|thumb|upright|[[Anna Katharina Schönkopf|Anna Katharina (''Käthchen'') Schönkopf]]]]
Goethe studied law at [[Leipzig University]] from 1765 to 1768. He detested learning age-old judicial rules by heart, preferring instead to attend the poetry lessons of [[Christian Fürchtegott Gellert]]. In Leipzig, Goethe fell in love with [[Anna Katharina Schönkopf]] and wrote cheerful verses about her in the [[Rococo]] genre. In 1770, he anonymously released ''Annette'', his first collection of poems. His uncritical admiration for many contemporary poets vanished as he became interested in [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] and [[Christoph Martin Wieland]]. By this time, Goethe had already written a great deal, but he discarded nearly all of these works except for the comedy ''Die Mitschuldigen''. The restaurant [[Auerbachs Keller]] and its legend of [[Johann Georg Faust|Faust's]] 1525 barrel ride impressed him so much that Auerbachs Keller became the only real place in his [[closet drama]] ''[[Faust Part One]]''. As his studies did not progress, Goethe was forced to return to Frankfurt at the close of August 1768.

Goethe became severely ill in Frankfurt. During the year and a half that followed, because of several relapses, the relationship with his father worsened. During convalescence, Goethe was nursed by his mother and sister. In April 1770, Goethe left Frankfurt in order to finish his studies at the [[University of Strasbourg]].

In [[Alsace]], Goethe blossomed. No other landscape has he described as affectionately as the warm, wide Rhine area. In Strasbourg, Goethe met [[Johann Gottfried Herder]]. The two became close friends, and crucially to Goethe's intellectual development, Herder kindled his interest in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Ossian]] and in the notion of ''Volkspoesie'' (folk poetry). On 14 October 1772 Goethe held a gathering in his parental home in honour of the first German "Shakespeare Day". His first acquaintance with Shakespeare's works is described as his personal awakening in literature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-duisburg-essen.de/einladung/Vorlesungen/dramatik/goetheshak.htm |title=Originally speech of Goethe to the ''Shakespeare's Day'' by University Duisburg |publisher=Uni-duisburg-essen.de |access-date=17 July 2014}}</ref>

On a trip to the village [[Sessenheim]], Goethe fell in love with [[Friederike Brion]], in October 1770,<ref>Herman Grimm: ''Goethe. Vorlesungen gehalten an der Königlichen Universität zu Berlin.'' Vol. 1. J.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;Cotta'sche Buchhandlung Nachfolger, Stuttgart / Berlin 1923, p.&nbsp;81</ref><ref>Karl Robert Mandelkow, Bodo Morawe: Goethes Briefe. 2. edition. Vol. 1: Briefe der Jahre 1764–1786. ''Christian Wegner'', Hamburg 1968, p. 571</ref> but terminated the relationship in August 1771.<ref>Valerian Tornius: ''Goethe – Leben, Wirken und Schaffen''. Ludwig-Röhrscheid-Verlag, Bonn 1949, p. 60</ref> Several of his poems, like "{{lang|de|Willkommen und Abschied}}", "{{lang|de|Sesenheimer Lieder}}" and "{{lang|de|Heidenröslein}}", originate from this time.

At the end of August 1771, Goethe acquired the academic degree of the ''Lizenziat'' ([[Licentia docendi]]) in Frankfurt and established a small legal practice. Although in his academic work he had expressed the ambition to make [[jurisprudence]] progressively more humane, his inexperience led him to proceed too vigorously in his first cases, and he was reprimanded and lost further ones. This prematurely terminated his career as a lawyer after only a few months. At this time, Goethe was acquainted with the court of [[Darmstadt]], where his inventiveness was praised. From this [[milieu]] came Johann Georg Schlosser (who later became Goethe's brother-in-law) and [[Johann Heinrich Merck]]. Goethe also pursued literary plans again; this time, his father did not have anything against it, and even helped. Goethe obtained a copy of the biography of a [[Nobility|noble]] [[highwayman]] from the [[German Peasants' War]]. In a couple of weeks the biography was reworked into a colourful drama. Entitled ''[[Götz von Berlichingen (Goethe)|Götz von Berlichingen]],'' the work went directly to the heart of Goethe's contemporaries.

Goethe could not subsist on being one of the editors of a literary periodical (published by Schlosser and Merck). In May 1772 he once more began the practice of law at [[Wetzlar]]. In 1774 he wrote the book which would bring him worldwide fame, ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]''. The outer shape of the work's plot is widely taken over from what Goethe experienced during his Wetzlar time with [[Charlotte Buff]] (1753–1828)<ref name="KestnerAndLotte">Mandelkow, Karl Robert (1962). ''Goethes Briefe''. Vol. 1: ''Briefe der Jahre 1764–1786''. Christian Wegner Verlag. p. 589</ref> and her fiancé, [[Johann Christian Kestner]] (1741–1800),<ref name="KestnerAndLotte" /> as well as from the suicide of the author's friend [[Karl Wilhelm Jerusalem]] (1747–1772); in it, Goethe made a desperate passion of what was in reality a hearty and relaxed friendship.<ref>Mandelkow, Karl Robert (1962). ''Goethes Briefe''. Vol. 1: ''Briefe der Jahre 1764–1786''. Christian Wegner Verlag. pp. 590–592</ref> Despite the immense success of ''Werther'', it did not bring Goethe much financial gain because copyright laws at the time were essentially nonexistent. (In later years Goethe would bypass this problem by periodically authorizing "new, revised" editions of his ''Complete Works''.)<ref>See ''Goethe and his Publishers''</ref>

=== Early years in Weimar ===
[[File:goethe.png|thumb|upright|Goethe in c. 1775]]
In 1775, Goethe was invited, on the strength of his fame as the author of ''The Sorrows of Young Werther'', to the court of [[Karl August, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Karl August, Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]], who would become [[Grand Duke]] in 1815. (The Duke at the time was 18 years of age, to Goethe's&nbsp;26.) Goethe thus went to live in [[Weimar]], where he remained for the rest of his life<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Goethe, Johann Wolfgang von |volume=12 |page=183 |first=John George |last=Robertson}}</ref> and where, over the course of many years, he held a succession of offices, including  superintendent of the ducal library,<ref>Gosnell, Charles F., and Géza Schütz. 1932. "Goethe the Librarian." ''Library Quarterly'' 2 (January): 367–374.</ref> as the Duke's friend and chief adviser.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Peter|last=Hume Brown|author-link=Peter Hume Brown|title=Life of Goethe|year=1920|pages=224–225}}</ref><ref>[https://www.klassik-stiftung.de/uploads/tx_lombkswdigitaldocs/Jahrbuch_2007_Mueller.pdf "Goethe und Carl August – Freundschaft und Politik"] by Gerhard Müller, in Th. Seemann (ed.): ''Anna Amalia, Carl August und das Ereignis Weimar''. Jahrbuch der Klassik Stiftung Weimar 2007. Göttingen: Wallstein Verlag, pp. 132–164 {{in lang|de}}</ref>

In 1776, Goethe formed a close relationship to [[Charlotte von Stein]], an older, married woman. The intimate bond with von Stein lasted for ten years, after which Goethe abruptly left for Italy without giving his companion any notice. She was emotionally distraught at the time, but they were eventually reconciled.<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Stein, Charlotte von |volume=25 |page=871}}</ref>

Goethe, aside from official duties, was also a friend and confidant to the Duke, and participated in the activities of the court. For Goethe, his first ten years at Weimar could well be described as a garnering of a degree and range of experience which perhaps could be achieved in no other way. In 1779, Goethe took on the War Commission of the Grand Duchy of [[Saxe-Weimar]], in addition to the Mines and Highways commissions. In 1782, when the chancellor of the Duchy's Exchequer left his office, Goethe agreed to act in his place for two and a half years; this post virtually made him prime minister and the principal representative of the Duchy.<ref name=Britannica /> Goethe was [[Ennoblement|ennobled]] in 1782 (this being indicated by the "[[von]]" in his name).

As head of the Saxe-Weimar War Commission, Goethe participated in the recruitment of mercenaries into the Prussian and British military during the American Revolution. The author {{interlanguage link|W. Daniel Wilson|de}} claims that Goethe engaged in negotiating the forced sale of vagabonds, criminals, and political dissidents as part of these activities.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Das Goethe-Tabu|last=Wilson|first=W.

=== Italy ===
[[File:Der junge Goethe, gemalt von Angelica Kauffmann 1787.JPG|thumb|upright|Goethe, age 38, painted by [[Angelica Kauffman]] 1787]]
Goethe's journey to the [[Italian peninsula]] and Sicily from 1786 to 1788 was of great significance in his aesthetic and philosophical development. His father had made a similar journey, and his example was a major motivating factor for Goethe to make the trip. More importantly, however, the work of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] had provoked a general renewed interest in the classical [[Ancient Greek art|art of ancient Greece]] and [[Roman art|Rome]]. Thus Goethe's journey had something of the nature of a [[pilgrimage]] to it. During the course of his trip Goethe met and befriended the artists [[Angelica Kauffman]] and [[Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein]], as well as encountering such notable characters as [[Emma, Lady Hamilton|Lady Hamilton]] and [[Alessandro Cagliostro]] (see [[Affair of the Diamond Necklace]]).

He also journeyed to Sicily during this time, and wrote that "To have seen Italy without having seen Sicily is to not have seen Italy at all, for Sicily is the clue to everything."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Desmond |first1=Will D. |title=Hegel's Antiquity |date=2020 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=10 |isbn=978-0-19-257574-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4bryDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA10}}</ref> While in Southern Italy and Sicily, Goethe encountered, for the first time genuine Greek (as opposed to Roman) architecture, and was quite startled by its relative simplicity. Winckelmann had not recognized the distinctness of the two styles.

Goethe's diaries of this period form the basis of the non-fiction ''[[Italian Journey]]''. ''Italian Journey'' only covers the first year of Goethe's visit. The remaining year is largely undocumented, aside from the fact that he spent much of it in [[Venice]]. This "gap in the record" has been the source of much speculation over the years.

In the decades which immediately followed its publication in 1816, ''Italian Journey'' inspired countless German youths to follow Goethe's example. This is pictured, somewhat satirically, in [[George Eliot]]'s ''[[Middlemarch]]''.

=== Weimar ===
[[File:Freiheitsbaum.jpg|thumb|A Goethe watercolour depicting a [[liberty pole]] at the border to the short-lived [[Republic of Mainz]], created under influence of the French Revolution and destroyed in the [[Siege of Mainz (1793)|Siege of Mainz]] in which Goethe participated]]
In late 1792, Goethe took part in the [[Battle of Valmy]] against [[French Revolution|revolutionary France]], assisting Duke [[Carl August, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Karl August]] of [[Saxe-Weimar|Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]] during the failed invasion of France. Again during the [[Siege of Mainz (1793)|Siege of Mainz]], he assisted Carl August as a military observer. His written account of these events can be found within his ''Complete Works''.

In 1794, [[Friedrich Schiller]] wrote to Goethe offering friendship; they had previously had only a mutually wary relationship ever since first becoming acquainted in 1788. This collaborative friendship lasted until Schiller's death in 1805.

[[File:Louise Seidler - J. W. Goethe 1811.jpg|thumb|upright=0.55|left|Goethe, by Luise Seidler (Weimar 1811)]]

In 1806, Goethe was living in Weimar with his mistress [[Christiane Vulpius]], the sister of [[Christian August Vulpius|Christian A. Vulpius]], and their son [[August von Goethe]]. On 13 October, [[Napoleon]]'s army invaded the town. The French "spoon guards", the least disciplined soldiers, occupied Goethe's house: {{quote|The 'spoon guards' had broken in, they had drunk wine, made a great uproar and called for the master of the house. Goethe's secretary Riemer reports: 'Although already undressed and wearing only his wide nightgown... he descended the stairs towards them and inquired what they wanted from him.... His dignified figure, commanding respect, and his spiritual mien seemed to impress even them.' But it was not to last long. Late at night they burst into his bedroom with drawn bayonets. Goethe was petrified, Christiane raised a lot of noise and even tangled with them, other people who had taken refuge in Goethe's house rushed in, and so the marauders eventually withdrew again. It was Christiane who commanded and organized the defense of the house on the Frauenplan. The barricading of the kitchen and the cellar against the wild pillaging soldiery was her work. Goethe noted in his diary: "Fires, rapine, a frightful night... Preservation of the house through steadfastness and luck." The luck was Goethe's, the steadfastness was displayed by Christiane.<ref>{{cite book|last=Safranski|first=Rüdiger|title=Schopenhauer and the Wild Years of Philosophy | publisher=Harvard University Press | year = 1990 |isbn= 978-0-674-79275-3}}</ref>}}

Days afterward, on 19 October 1806, Goethe legitimized their 18-year relationship by marrying Christiane in a quiet marriage service at the {{interlanguage link|Jakobskirche (Weimar)|de|lt=Jakobskirche in Weimar}}. They had already had several children together by this time, including their son, Julius August Walter von Goethe (1789–1830), whose wife, [[Ottilie von Goethe|Ottilie von Pogwisch]] (1796–1872), cared for the elder Goethe until his death in 1832. August and Ottilie had three children: [[Walther von Goethe|Walther, Freiherr von Goethe]] (1818–1885), {{interlanguage link|Wolfgang Maximilian von Goethe|de|lt=Wolfgang, Freiherr von Goethe}} (1820–1883) and {{interlanguage link|Alma von Goethe|de}} (1827–1844). Christiane von Goethe died in 1816. Johann reflected, "There is nothing more charming to see than a mother with her child in her arms, and there is nothing more venerable than a mother among a number of her children."<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fcYZlz0ezQUC&pg=PA385|title=The Child and Childhood in Folk Thought: (The Child in Primitive Culture), p. 385|last=Chamberlain|first=Alexander|date=1896|publisher=MacMillan|language=en}}</ref>

[[File:Ulrike von Levetzow.jpg|upright|thumb|Ulrike von Levetzow]]

=== Later life ===
After 1793, Goethe devoted his endeavours primarily to literature. By 1820, Goethe was on amiable terms with [[Kaspar Maria von Sternberg]].
In 1823, having recovered from a near fatal heart illness, the 74-year-old Goethe fell in love with the teenaged [[Ulrike von Levetzow]] whom he wanted to marry, but because of the opposition of her mother he never proposed. Their last meeting in [[Karlovy Vary|Carlsbad]] on 5 September 1823 inspired his famous ''[[Marienbad Elegy]]'' which he considered one of his finest works.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hamelika.cz/SHAMELIKA/1974/1974_16/h74_16.htm|title=Goethe's third summer}}</ref> During that time he also developed a deep emotional bond with the Polish pianist [[Maria Agata Szymanowska]].<ref>Briscoe, J. R. (Ed.). (2004). ''New historical anthology of music by women'' (Vol. 1). Indiana University Press. pp. 126–127.</ref>

In 1821 Goethe's friend [[Carl Friedrich Zelter]] introduced him to the 12-year-old [[Felix Mendelssohn]]. Goethe, now in his seventies, was greatly impressed by the child, leading to perhaps the earliest confirmed comparison with [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] in the following conversation between Goethe and Zelter:

{{quote|"Musical prodigies&nbsp;... are probably no longer so rare; but what this little man can do in extemporizing and playing at sight borders the miraculous, and I could not have believed it possible at so early an age." "And yet you heard Mozart in his seventh year at Frankfurt?" said Zelter. "Yes", answered Goethe, "...&nbsp;but what your pupil already accomplishes, bears the same relation to the Mozart of that time that the cultivated talk of a grown-up person bears to the prattle of a child."{{sfn|Todd|2003|p=89}}}}

Mendelssohn was invited to meet Goethe on several later occasions,{{sfn|Mercer-Taylor|2000|pp=41–42, 93}} and set a number of Goethe's poems to music. His other compositions inspired by Goethe include the overture ''[[Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage (Mendelssohn)|Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage]]'' (Op. 27, 1828), and the cantata ''[[Die erste Walpurgisnacht]]'' (''The First Walpurgis Night'', Op. 60, 1832).{{sfn|Todd|2003|pp=188–190, 269–270}}

=== Death ===

In 1832, Goethe died in [[Weimar]] of apparent heart failure. His last words, according to his doctor {{ill|Carl Vogel (physician)|de|Carl Vogel (Mediziner)|lt=Carl Vogel}}, were, ''{{Lang|de|Mehr Licht!}}'' (More light!), but this is disputed as Vogel was not in the room at the moment Goethe died.<ref>{{ill|Carl Vogel (physician)|de|Carl Vogel (Mediziner)|lt=Carl Vogel}}: "Die letzte Krankheit Goethe's".

[[Johann Peter Eckermann|Eckermann]] closes his famous work, ''[[Conversations with Goethe]]'', with this passage:
{{Quotation|The morning after Goethe's death, a deep desire seized me to look once again upon his earthly garment. His faithful servant, Frederick, opened for me the chamber in which he was laid out. Stretched upon his back, he reposed as if asleep; profound peace and security reigned in the features of his sublimely noble countenance. The mighty brow seemed yet to harbour thoughts. I wished for a lock of his hair; but reverence prevented me from cutting it off. The body lay naked, only wrapped in a white sheet; large pieces of ice had been placed near it, to keep it fresh as long as possible. Frederick drew aside the sheet, and I was astonished at the divine magnificence of the limbs. The breast was powerful, broad, and arched; the arms and thighs were elegant, and of the most perfect shape; nowhere, on the whole body, was there a trace of either fat or of leanness and decay. A perfect man lay in great beauty before me; and the rapture the sight caused me made me forget for a moment that the immortal spirit had left such an abode. I laid my hand on his heart – there was a deep silence – and I turned away to give free vent to my suppressed tears.}}

The first production of [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'' took place in Weimar in 1850. The conductor was [[Franz Liszt]], who chose the date 28 August in honour of Goethe, who was born on 28 August 1749.<ref>''[[Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', 5th ed., 1954{{page needed|date=January 2021}}</ref>


===Descendants===

Goethe married his long-time lover [[Christiane Vulpius]] in 1806. They had 5 children, of whom only their eldest son [[August von Goethe]] managed to survive into adulthood. One was stillborn, while the others died early. August had 3 children with [[Ottilie von Goethe]], [[Walther von Goethe]], Wolfgang and Alma. Alma died of [[Typhoid fever]] during the outbreak in Vienna, the month before her 17th birthday. Walther and Wolfgang neither married nor had any children. Walther's gravestone states: "With him ends Goethe's dynasty, the name will last forever.", marking the end of Goethe's bloodline. While Goethe has no direct descendants, he is known to have indirect descendants through his siblings.

=== Overview ===
The most important of Goethe's works produced before he went to Weimar were ''[[Götz von Berlichingen (Goethe)|Götz von Berlichingen]]'' (1773), a tragedy that was the first work to bring him recognition, and the novel ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'' (German: ''Die Leiden des jungen Werthers'') (1774), which gained him enormous fame as a writer in the ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' period which marked the early phase of [[Romanticism]]. Indeed, ''Werther'' is often considered to be the "spark" which ignited the movement, and can arguably be called the world's first "[[Bestseller#Early best sellers|best-seller]]." During the years at Weimar before he met [[Schiller]] in 1794, he began ''[[Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship]]''<ref>Ludwig, Emil (1928) ''GOETHE: The History of a Man 1749-1833, Schiller and Wilhelm Meister'' Translated by Ethel Colburn Mayne, New York: G.P.

To the period of his friendship with Schiller belong the conception of ''[[Wilhelm Meister's Journeyman Years]]'' (the continuation of ''Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship''), the [[idyll]] of ''[[Hermann and Dorothea]]'', the ''[[Roman Elegies]] '' and the verse drama ''[[The Natural Daughter]]''.<ref name="generally">See, generally Schiller, F.

''[[Faust, Part Two]]'' was completed before his 1832 death and published posthumously later that year. His writings were immediately influential in literary and artistic circles.<ref name="generally"/>

Goethe was fascinated by [[Kalidasa]]'s ''[[Abhijñānaśākuntalam]]'', which was one of the first works of [[Sanskrit literature]] that became known in Europe, after being translated from English to German.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ix-RShGgZUAC&pg=PA9 |title=Sanskrit Drama in Performance |first1=Rachel Van M. |last1=Baumer |first2=James R. |last2=Brandon |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |year=1993 |orig-year=1981 |isbn=978-81-208-0772-3 |page=9}}</ref>

=== Details of selected works ===
The short [[epistolary novel]] ''Die Leiden des jungen Werthers'', or ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'', published in 1774, recounts an unhappy romantic infatuation that ends in suicide. Goethe admitted that he "shot his hero to save himself": a reference to Goethe's own near-suicidal obsession with a young woman during this period, an obsession he quelled through the writing process. The novel remains in print in dozens of languages and its influence is undeniable; its central hero, an obsessive figure driven to despair and destruction by his unrequited love for the young Lotte, has become a pervasive literary [[archetype]]. The fact that ''Werther'' ends with the protagonist's suicide and funeral—a funeral which "no clergyman attended"—made the book deeply controversial upon its (anonymous) publication, for on the face of it, it appeared to condone and glorify suicide. Suicide is considered sinful by [[Christian doctrine]]: suicides were denied [[Christian burial]] with the bodies often mistreated and dishonoured in various ways; in corollary, the deceased's property and possessions were often confiscated by the Church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pipsproject.com/Understanding%20Suicide.html|publisher=Pips Project|title=The Stigma of Suicide – A history|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006120251/http://pipsproject.com/Understanding%20Suicide.html|archive-date=6 October 2007|df=dmy-all}} See also: {{cite web|url=http://elsinore.ucsc.edu/burial/burialSuicide.html|title=Ophelia's Burial}}</ref> However, Goethe explained his use of ''Werther'' in his autobiography. He said he "turned reality into poetry but his friends thought poetry should be turned into reality and the poem imitated". He was against this reading of poetry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/autobiographyofg00goet|title=The Auto-Biography of Goethe.

Bohn|via=Internet Archive|page={{page needed|date=May 2021}}}}</ref> Epistolary novels were common during this time, letter-writing being a primary mode of communication. What set Goethe's book apart from other such novels was its expression of unbridled longing for a joy beyond possibility, its sense of defiant rebellion against authority, and of principal importance, its total subjectivity: qualities that trailblazed the Romantic movement.

The next work, his epic [[closet drama]] ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'', was completed in stages. The first part was published in 1808 and created a sensation. Goethe finished ''[[Faust Part Two]]'' in the year of his death, and the work was published posthumously. Goethe's original draft of a Faust play, which probably dates from 1773–74, and is now known as the ''Urfaust'', was also published after his death.<ref>''Goethe's Plays, by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe'', translated into English with introductions by Charles E. Passage, Publisher Benn Limited, 1980, {{ISBN|978-0-510-00087-5|978-0-510-00087-5}}</ref>

The first operatic version of Goethe's ''Faust'', by [[Louis Spohr]], appeared in 1814. The work subsequently inspired operas and oratorios by [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]], [[Charles Gounod|Gounod]], [[Arrigo Boito|Boito]], [[Ferruccio Busoni|Busoni]] and [[Alfred Schnittke|Schnittke]], as well as symphonic works by [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]], [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] and [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]]. Faust became the [[wikt:ur-|ur-myth]] of many figures in the 19th century. Later, a facet of its plot, i.e., of selling one's soul to the devil for power over the physical world, took on increasing literary importance and became a view of the victory of technology and of industrialism, along with its dubious human expenses. In 1919, the [[world premiere]] complete production of ''Faust'' was staged at the [[Goetheanum]].

Goethe's poetic work served as a model for an entire movement in German poetry termed ''Innerlichkeit'' ("introversion") and represented by, for example, [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]]. Goethe's words inspired a number of compositions by, among others, [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] (who idolised Goethe),<ref>{{cite web|last=Wigmore|first=Richard|title=A meeting of genius: Beethoven and Goethe, July 1812|url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/features/focus/a-meeting-of-genius-beethoven-and-goethe-july-1812|work=Gramophone|publisher=Haymarket|access-date=6 July 2012|date=2012-07-02}}</ref> [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], Berlioz and [[Hugo Wolf|Wolf]]. Perhaps the single most influential piece is "Mignon's Song" which opens with one of the most famous lines in German poetry, an allusion to Italy: "''{{lang|de|Kennst du das Land, wo die Zitronen blühn}}''?" ("Do you know the land where the lemon trees bloom?").

He is also widely quoted. Epigrams such as "Against criticism a man can neither protest nor defend himself; he must act in spite of it, and then it will gradually yield to him", "[[Divide and rule]], a sound motto; unite and lead, a better one", and "Enjoy when you can, and endure when you must", are still in usage or are often paraphrased. Lines from ''Faust'', such as "{{lang|de|Das also war des Pudels Kern}}", "{{lang|de|Das ist der Weisheit letzter Schluss}}", or "{{lang|de|Grau ist alle Theorie}}" have entered everyday German usage.

Some well-known quotations are often incorrectly attributed to Goethe. These include [[Hippocrates]]' "Art is long, life is short", which is echoed in Goethe's ''Faust'' and ''Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship''.

Although his literary work has attracted the most interest, Goethe was also keenly involved in studies of natural science.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.natureinstitute.org/about/who/goethe.htm |publisher=[[The Nature Institute]]|title=Johann Wolfgang von Goethe |access-date=28 August 2008}}</ref> He wrote several works on [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] and colour theory.

By the time of his death, in order to gain a comprehensive view in geology, he had collected 17,800 rock samples.

His focus on morphology and what was later called [[Homology (biology)|homology]] influenced 19th-century [[natural history|naturalists]], although his ideas of transformation were about the continuous metamorphosis of living things and did not relate to contemporary ideas of "transformisme" or [[transmutation of species]].

During his Italian journey, Goethe formulated a theory of plant metamorphosis in which the archetypal form of the plant is to be found in the ''leaf'' – he writes, "from top to bottom a plant is all leaf, united so inseparably with the future bud that one cannot be imagined without the other".<ref>{{cite book |last=Goethe |first=J.W. |title=Italian Journey |publisher=Suhrkamp ed., vol. 6 | others = Robert R Heitner}}</ref> In 1790, he published his ''[[Metamorphosis of Plants]]''.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/agr08000317/|title=Versuch die Metamorphose der Pflanzen zu Erklären|publisher=Library of Congress|access-date=2 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Fjuaog1_E0C&q=intermaxillary+bone+prove&pg=PA86|title=Metamorphosis of Plants|access-date=28 August 2008|isbn=978-1-4179-4984-7|author1=Magnus, Rudolf|author2=Schmid, Gunther|year=2004}}</ref> As one of the many precursors in the history of evolutionary thought, Goethe wrote in ''Story of My Botanical Studies'' (1831):

{{quote|The ever-changing display of plant forms, which I have followed for so many years, awakens increasingly within me the notion: The plant forms which surround us were not all created at some given point in time and then locked into the given form, they have been given... a felicitous mobility and plasticity that allows them to grow and adapt themselves to many different conditions in many different places.<ref>Frank Teichmann (tr.

Goethe also popularized the [[Goethe barometer]] using a principle established by [[Evangelista Torricelli|Torricelli]]. According to Hegel, "Goethe has occupied himself a good deal with meteorology; barometer readings interested him particularly... What he says is important: the main thing is that he gives a comparative table of barometric readings during the whole month of December 1822, at Weimar, [[Jena]], London, Boston, Vienna, [[Töpel]]... He claims to deduce from it that the barometric level varies in the same proportion not only in each zone but that it has the same variation, too, at different altitudes above sea-level".<ref>Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, ''Hegel's Philosophy of Nature: Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences'' (1830), part 2 translated by A.V.

[[File:Goethe-LightSpectrum.svg|thumb|left|Light spectrum, from ''[[Theory of Colours]]''. Goethe observed that with a [[Dispersive prism|prism]], colour arises at light-dark edges, and the spectrum occurs where these coloured edges overlap.]]
In 1810, Goethe published his ''[[Theory of Colours]]'', which he considered his most important work. In it, he contentiously characterized colour as arising from the dynamic interplay of light and darkness through the mediation of a turbid medium.<ref>Aristotle [https://archive.org/details/aristotledesensu00arisuoft/page/57 <!-- quote=aristotle + "de sensu" + white and black may be juxtaposed". --> wrote] that colour is a mixture of light and dark, since white light is always seen as somewhat darkened when it is seen as a colour. (Aristotle, ''On Sense and its Objects'', III, 439b, 20 ff.: "White and black may be juxtaposed in such a way that by the minuteness of the division of its parts each is invisible while their product is visible, and thus colour may be produced.")</ref> In 1816, [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] went on to develop his own theory in ''[[On&nbsp;Vision and Colors|On Vision and Colours]]'' based on the observations supplied in Goethe's book. After being translated into English by [[Charles Lock Eastlake|Charles Eastlake]] in 1840, his theory became widely adopted by the art world, most notably [[J.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;W. Turner]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Bockemuhl |first=M. |title=Turner |publisher=Taschen, Koln |year=1991|isbn=978-3-8228-6325-1}}</ref> Goethe's work also inspired the philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], to write his ''[[Remarks on Colour]]''. Goethe was vehemently opposed to [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s analytic treatment of colour, engaging instead in compiling a comprehensive ''rational description'' of a wide variety of colour phenomena. Although the accuracy of Goethe's observations does not admit a great deal of criticism, his aesthetic approach did not lend itself to the demands of analytic and mathematical analysis used ubiquitously in modern Science. Goethe was, however, the first to systematically study the physiological effects of colour, and his observations on the effect of opposed colours led him to a symmetric arrangement of his colour wheel, "for the colours diametrically opposed to each other ... are those which reciprocally evoke each other in the eye."<ref>{{cite book|last=Goethe |first=Johann |url=http://theoryofcolor.org/Physiological+Colours#par50 |title=Theory of Colours, paragraph No. 50 |year=1810}}</ref> In this, he anticipated [[Ewald Hering]]'s [[Opponent process|opponent colour theory]] (1872).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webexhibits.org/colorart/ch.html |title=Goethe's Color Theory|access-date=28 August 2008}}</ref>

Goethe outlines his method in the essay ''The experiment as mediator between subject and object'' (1772).<ref>{{cite web|title=The Experiment as Mediator between Subject and Object|access-date=26 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110082845/http://pages.slc.edu/~eraymond/bestfoot.html|url=http://pages.slc.edu/~eraymond/bestfoot.html|archive-date=10 November 2011 }}</ref> In the Kurschner edition of Goethe's works, the science editor, [[Rudolf Steiner]], presents Goethe's approach to science as [[phenomenological model|phenomenological]].

[[Novalis]], himself a geologist and mining engineer, expressed the opinion that Goethe was the first physicist of his time and "epoch-making in the history of physics", writing that Goethe's studies of light, of the metamorphosis of plants and of insects were indications and proofs "that the perfect educational lecture belongs in the artist's sphere of work"; and that Goethe would be surpassed "but only in the way in which the ancients can be surpassed, in inner content and force, in variety and depth—as an artist actually not, or only very little, for his rightness and intensity are perhaps already more exemplary than it would seem".<ref>'Goethe's Message of Beauty in Our Twentieth Century World', (Friedrich) [[Frederick Hiebel]], RSCP California. {{ISBN|978-0-916786-37-3}}</ref>

== Eroticism ==
Many of Goethe's works, especially ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'', the ''[[Roman Elegies]]'', and the ''Venetian Epigrams'', depict erotic passions and acts. For instance, in ''Faust'', the first use of Faust's power after signing a contract with the devil is to [[Ephebophilia|seduce a teenage girl]]. Some of the ''Venetian Epigrams'' were held back from publication due to their sexual content. Goethe clearly saw [[human sexuality]] as a topic worthy of poetic and artistic depiction, an idea that was uncommon in a time when the private nature of sexuality was rigorously normative.<ref>''Outing Goethe and His Age''; edited by Alice A. Kuzniar.{{page needed|date=July 2017}}</ref>

In a conversation on April 7, 1830 Goethe stated that [[pederasty]] is an "aberration" that easily leads to "animal, roughly material" behavior. He continued, "Pederasty is as old as humanity itself, and one can therefore say, that it resides in nature, even if it proceeds against nature....What culture has won from nature will not be surrendered or given up at any price."<ref name="Gedenkausgabe der Werke, Briefe und Gespräche">{{cite book |last1=Goethe |first1=Johann Wolfgang |title=Gedenkausgabe der Werke, Briefe und Gespräche |date=1976 |publisher=Zürich : Artemis Verl. |page=686 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hX_fAAAAMAAJ |access-date=27 April 2016}}</ref> On another occasion he wrote: "I like boys a lot, but the girls are even nicer.

== Religion and politics ==

Born into a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] family, Goethe's early faith was shaken by news of such events as the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]] and the [[Seven Years' War]].

(New York: The Viking Press, 1954)</ref>

Goethe embodied many of the contending strands in art over the next century: his work could be lushly emotional, and rigorously formal, brief and [[epigram]]matic, and epic. He would argue that [[Classicism]] was the means of controlling art, and that [[Romanticism]] was a sickness, even as he penned poetry rich in memorable images, and rewrote the formal rules of German poetry. His poetry was set to music by almost every major Austrian and German composer from [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] to [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], and his influence would spread to French drama and opera as well. [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] declared that a "Faust" Symphony would be the greatest thing for art. [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]] and Mahler both created symphonies in whole or in large part inspired by this [[Social influence|seminal]] work, which would give the 19th century one of its most paradigmatic figures: [[Faust|Doctor Faustus]].

The ''Faust'' tragedy/drama, often called ''{{lang|de|'''Das''' Drama der Deutschen}}'' ('''the''' drama of the Germans), written in two parts published decades apart, would stand as his most characteristic and famous artistic creation. Followers of the twentieth-century [[esotericist]] [[Rudolf Steiner]] built a theatre named the [[Goetheanum]] after him—where festival performances of ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' are still performed.

Goethe was also a cultural force.

Goethe's influence was dramatic because he understood that there was a transition in European sensibilities, an increasing focus on sense, the indescribable, and the emotional. This is not to say that he was emotionalistic or excessive; on the contrary, he lauded personal restraint and felt that excess was a disease: "There is nothing worse than imagination without taste". Goethe praised [[Francis Bacon]] for his advocacy of science based on experiment and his forceful revolution in thought as one of the greatest strides forward in modern science.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Richter |first1=Simon J. |title=Goethe Yearbook 14 |date=2007 |publisher=Harvard University Press |pages=113–114}}</ref> However, he was critical of Bacon's inductive method and approach based on pure classification.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Amrine |first1=F.R. |last2=Zucker |first2=Francis J. |title=Goethe and the Sciences: A Reappraisal |date=2012 |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |page=232}}</ref> He said in ''Scientific Studies'':

His views make him, along with [[Adam Smith]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], a figure in two worlds: on the one hand, devoted to the sense of taste, order, and finely crafted detail, which is the hallmark of the artistic sense of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Age of Reason]] and the [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]] period of [[architecture]]; on the other, seeking a personal, intuitive, and personalized form of expression and society, firmly supporting the idea of self-regulating and organic systems. George Henry Lewes celebrated Goethe's revolutionary understanding of the organism.<ref name="Roach" />

Thinkers such as [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] would take up many similar ideas in the 1800s. Goethe's ideas on [[evolution]] would frame the question that [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace|Wallace]] would approach within the scientific paradigm. The Serbian inventor and electrical engineer [[Nikola Tesla]] was heavily influenced by [[Goethe's Faust|Goethe's ''Faust'']], his favorite poem, and had actually memorized the entire text.
