==Life and career==

Beddor grew up in [[Excelsior, Minnesota|Excelsior]] in [[Minnesota]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} His parents often traveled and by age 12 Beddor already knew how to barefoot-ski.<ref name="lookingglasswars1">{{cite web|url=http://www.lookingglasswars.com/about-folder/FBbio.pdf |title=Frank Beddor : Resume |publisher=Lookingglasswars.com |accessdate=2015-03-06}}</ref> After winning nationals{{clarify|date=January 2017}} Beddor was invited to join the Olympic ski team.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} He went on tour in Europe for competitive skiing.<ref name="lookingglasswars1"/> Beddor was World Champion freestyler skier in 1981 and 1982.<ref name="imdb.com"/> He seemed to be following in his father’s footsteps, as his father had also been a well-known skier and had set a world record by skiing the length of Mississippi river.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In 1985 Beddor played [[John Cusack]]'s skiing stunt double in ''[[Better Off Dead (film)|Better Off Dead]]''.<ref name="imdb.com"/> Beddor moved to Los Angeles during this period and studied with acting coach [[Stella Adler]].<ref name="lookingglasswars1"/> Part of Adler's method was encouraging her students to write the scene the character is in before stepping onstage. Beddor became frustrated with the lack of good scripts he was being given and began to try producing.<ref name="lookingglasswars1"/> His most notable work as a producer was on the 1998 film ''[[There's Something About Mary]]'' starring [[Cameron Diaz]] and [[Ben Stiller]].<ref name="imdb.com"/>{{better source needed|date=June 2018}}

However, Beddor found not being the creative force behind projects frustrating and then turned to writing. Beddor spent five years writing ''[[The Looking Glass Wars]]'' after being inspired by playing cards in the [[Museum of London]].<ref name="youtube1"/> The book was rejected by every major publisher in the US before Beddor was accepted by [[Egmont Books]] in the UK.<ref name="lookingglasswars1"/>

''The Looking Glass Wars'' became popular and was on ''The New York Times'' Bestseller list.<ref name="youtube1"/> The books are a re-imagining of [[Lewis Carroll]]'s novel ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]''. The premise of the novels is that the character of Alice in ''Alice in Wonderland'' is real, as is the world of Wonderland, but that Carroll rewrote the events and made Wonderland seem childlike and did not reflect the reality of Wonderland.<ref name="youtube1"/>{{better source needed|date=June 2018}}

Beddor has written two more books in The Looking Glass Wars series, ''[[Seeing Redd]]'' and ''[[ArchEnemy]]''. The book has also inspired a spin-off comic book called ''[[The Looking Glass Wars#Hatter M limited series|Hatter Madigan]]'', also written by Beddor and co-authored by [[Liz Cavalier]] with the art by [[Ben Templesmith]]. The spin-off focuses on Hatter Madigan, a character in ''The Looking Glass Wars''. A script has also been written for the series to be created as a movie with [[Chuck Roven]] having signed on as a producer. However, since the release of [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', the film has been in "wait and see" mode.<ref>{{cite web|author=Steven Horn |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/607/607521p1.html |title=Exclusive Interview: Frank Beddor (Part One of Two) - Movies Feature at IGN |publisher=Movies.ign.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-19}}</ref>
