CrimethInc. cells have published books, released records, and organized national campaigns against globalization and representative democracy in favor of radical community organizing. Less public splinter groups have carried out direct action (including arson and [[hacktivism]]), hosted international conventions and other events, maintained local chapters, sparked riots, and toured with multimedia performance art or hardcore [[anarcho-punk]] musical ensembles. The collective has received national media and academic attention, as well as criticism and praise from other anarchists for its activities and philosophy. CrimethInc. has an association with the North American anarcho-punk scene due to its relationship with artists in the genre and its publishing of ''Inside Front'' as well as more recently the contemporary anti-capitalist movement.

CrimethInc. is connected to publishing collectives/organizations with similar ideas, notably the [[Curious George Brigade]], which has written a number of publications including ''Anarchy in the Age of Dinosaurs''. In 2005, they began publishing a half-gloss journal, ''Rolling Thunder'', with the byline "An Anarchist Journal of Dangerous Living", which released its eighth issue in 2009.

Since the summer of 2002, CrimethInc. has hosted annual conventions, termed "convergences", open to anyone. Typically featuring the performances of traveling theatrical troupes, musicians, direct-action and [[mutual aid (politics)|mutual-aid]] workshops from individual participants, the few-days-long camping trips have attracted coverage in newspaper articles,<ref name=gouss/> initiated multiple [[Reclaim the Streets]] actions, mobilized large [[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass]] events, and catalyzed many other activities.<ref name=ao7/>

The 2007 convergence in [[Athens, Ohio]], saw an impromptu [[street party]] which resulted in arrests on minor charges.<ref name=gouss>

There has been a pattern of promoting convergences as festivals, reminiscent of barnstorming [[flying circus]]es and travelling sideshows.<ref name=ao7>{{cite web|url=http://www.infoshop.org/inews/article.php?story=2007073009151431 |title=Athens, Ohio: Police attack Crimethinc conference |work=Infoshop News |publisher=[[Infoshop.org]] |access-date=2008-04-28 |date=2007-07-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523102836/http://www.infoshop.org/inews/article.php?story=2007073009151431 |archive-date=2011-05-23 }}</ref>

''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]]'' journalist Matthew Power described the 2006 convergence in [[Winona, Minnesota]] as follows:
{{quote|text=Several hundred young anarchists from around the country had train-hopped and hitchhiked there to attend the annual event known as the CrimethInc Convergence...Grimy and feral-looking, the CrimethInc kids squatted in small groups around a clearing....[they] were in the middle of several days of self-organized workshops, seminars, and discussions, ranging from the [[mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist banking]] theories of the nineteenth-century anarchist philosopher [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], to an introductory practicum on lock-picking, to a class on making one's own menstrual pads .... CrimethInc's adherents had come together there because they wanted to live their lives as some sort of solution. They saw 'the revolution' not as a final product but as an ongoing process; they wanted not just to destroy the capitalist system but to create something livable in its place.<ref name="harper's"/>|sign=Matthew Power|source=''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', March 2008}}

These convergences have been hosted by different groups within the collective each time, typically based on the initiative of local enthusiasts. Every year a different set of policy requests is released from locals in the field, typically encouraging a sober, consensus-based space in which no financial transactions are made. The one firm rule has been "No police informants," a regulation which has been ignored by the [[FBI]]. Information gathered by FBI informants at CrimethInc. convergences (in 2004, 2005, and 2008) contributed to the convictions of [[Eric McDavid]] and his associates, as well as [[2008 Republican National Convention]] protester Matthew DePalma.<ref>http://www.startribune.com/local/stpaul/41070787.html?elr=KArks:DCiUtEia_nDaycUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aUU {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607063219/http://www.startribune.com/local/stpaul/41070787.html?elr=KArks%3ADCiUtEia_nDaycUiD3aPc%3A_Yyc%3AaUU |date=2011-06-07 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/Conventions/story?id=5718900&page=1 |title=Michigan Man Accused of RNC Molotov Cocktail Plot |author=ABC News |work=ABC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://static.kovr.viacomlocalnetworks.com/~kovr/affidavit.pdf |archive-date=2007-01-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070111192140/http://static.kovr.viacomlocalnetworks.com/~kovr/affidavit.pdf |title=Confidential Source "Anna"-issued affidavit |access-date=2008-07-21 |format=[[.pdf]] |work=United States District Court Eastern District of California}}</ref>

=== Music ===

CrimethInc. is associated with the [[North America]]n [[anarcho-punk]] scene because of its long relationship with notable musicians in the genre and its publishing of ''Inside Front'', a "journal of hardcore punk and anarchist action".<ref name="thompson-music">{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Stacy |title=Punk Productions: Unfinished Business |publisher=SUNY Press |pages=109 |location=Albany |year=2004 |isbn=0-7914-6187-4 }}</ref> CrimethInc. releases include LPs, CDs, and 7"s from North American and European anarcho-punk, hardcore and [[anti-folk]] bands. Academic Stacy Thompson has described CrimethInc. as "exemplary of a more contemporary and nuanced approach" to the possible forms anarcho-punk could take to resist commodification through aesthetic expression.<ref name="thompson-music"/> However, Thompson does not consider the aesthetic choices of the collective to be substantially different from the anarcho- and [[crust punk]] bands released by fellow anarcho-punk collective ''[[Profane Existence]]'' in the mid-to-late 90s.<ref name="thompson-music"/>

==Philosophy==
[[File:CrimethInc. - eclipse the past.png|thumb|140px|"Eclipse the past" inside front cover image from CrimethInc.'s ''Days of War, Nights of Love'' (2001). A philosophical theme of CrimethInc.'s writings is the rejection of the "exclusive, anti-[[subjectivity|subjective]]" nature of history, and the need to take active control of one's own life.]]
