'''Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|FRS|FRSE|PC}} (25 October 1800{{snd}}28 December 1859) was a British historian and [[Whig (British political faction)|Whig]] politician. He is considered primarily responsible for introducing the Western education system in India. He wrote extensively as an essayist, on contemporary and historical sociopolitical subjects, and as a reviewer. His ''[[The History of England from the Accession of James the Second|The History of England]]'' was a seminal and paradigmatic example of [[Whig history]], and its literary style has remained an object of praise since its publication, including subsequent to the widespread condemnation of its historical contentions which became popular in the 20th century.<ref name="MacKenzie2013">{{citation|first=John|last= MacKenzie|title=A family empire|work=BBC History Magazine|date=January 2013}}</ref>

Macaulay served as the [[Secretary at War]] between 1839 and 1841, and as the [[Paymaster-General]] between 1846 and 1848. He played a major role in the introduction of English and western concepts to [[education in India]], and published his argument on the subject in the "Macaulay's Minute" in 1835. He supported the replacement of [[Persian language|Persian]] by English as the [[official language]], the use of English as the medium of instruction in all schools, and the training of English-speaking Indians as teachers.<ref name="MacKenzie2013"/> This led to [[Macaulayism]] in India, and the systematic wiping out of traditional and ancient Indian education and vocational systems and sciences.<ref name="Kampfner2013">{{Cite web |title=Macaulay by Zareer Masani – review |last=Kampfner |first=John |work=The Guardian |date=22 July 2013 |access-date=30 August 2019 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jul/22/thomas-macaulay-zareer-masani-review }}</ref>

Macaulay divided the world into civilised nations and barbarism, with Britain representing the high point of civilisation. In his [[English Education Act 1835#Macaulay's "Minute Upon Indian Education"|''Minute on Indian Education'']] of February 1835, he asserted, "It is, I believe, no exaggeration to say that all the historical information which has been collected from all the books written in the [[Sanskrit]] language is less valuable than what may be found in the most paltry abridgments used at preparatory schools in England".<ref name="columbia.edu" /> He was wedded to the [[idea of progress]], especially in terms of the liberal freedoms. He opposed [[radicalism (historical)|radicalism]] while idealising historic British culture and traditions.<ref name="MacKenzie2013"/>

==Early life==
Macaulay was born at [[Rothley Temple]]<ref>{{cite book|title=Biographical index of former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|year=2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0-902-198-84-X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}</ref> in [[Leicestershire]] on 25 October 1800, the son of [[Zachary Macaulay]], a Scottish [[Scottish Highlands|Highlander]], who became a [[Governor#British Empire and Commonwealth of Nations|colonial governor]] and [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionist]], and Selina Mills of [[Bristol]], a former pupil of [[Hannah More]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Thomas Babbington Macaulay|url=http://www.josephsmithacademy.org/wiki/thomas-babington-macaulay/|publisher=Josephsmithacademy|access-date=10 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180512191015/http://www.josephsmithfoundation.org/wiki/thomas-babington-macaulay/|archive-date=12 May 2018}}</ref> They named their first child after his uncle [[Thomas Babington]], a [[Leicestershire]] landowner and politician,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Symonds|first1=P.

He was educated at a private school in [[Hertfordshire]], and, subsequently, at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].<ref>{{acad|id=FML817TB|name=Macaulay, Thomas Babington}}</ref> Whilst at Cambridge, Macaulay wrote much poetry and won several prizes, including the [[Chancellor's Gold Medal]] in June 1821.<ref name=ODNB />

In 1825, Macaulay published a prominent essay on Milton in the ''[[Edinburgh Review]]''. He studied law, and in 1826 he was [[Call to the Bar|called to the bar]], but he soon took more interest in a political career.{{sfn|Pattison|1911|p=193}} In 1827, Macaulay published an anti-slavery essay, in the ''Edinburgh Review'', in which he contested the analysis of African labourers composed by [[Thomas Moody (1779-1849)|Colonel Thomas Moody, Knight]], who was the Parliamentary Commissioner for West Indian slavery.{{sfn|Rupprecht|2012|pp= 435–455}}{{sfn|Macaulay |1873|p=361|loc= Vol. VI}} Macaulay's father, [[Zachary Macaulay]], had also condemned the philosophy of Moody, in a series of letters to the ''[[Anti-Slavery Reporter]]''.{{sfn|Rupprecht|2012|pp= 435–455}}<ref name="Legacies of British Slave Ownership, UCL">{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/person/view/6650|website=Legacies of British Slave-Ownership|title= Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Moody: Profile and Legacies Summary|publisher=University College London|access-date=6 June 2016}}</ref>

Macaulay, who never married and had no children, was rumoured to have fallen in love with [[Maria Kinnaird]], who was the wealthy ward of [[Richard Sharp (politician)|Richard "Conversation" Sharp]].{{sfn|Cropper|1864|p=|ps=: see entry for 22 November 1831}} Macaulay's strongest emotional ties were to his youngest sisters: Margaret, who died while he was in India, and Hannah. As Hannah grew older, he formed a close attachment to Hannah's daughter Margaret, whom he called "Baba".{{sfn|Sullivan|2010|p=466}}

Macaulay retained a passionate interest in western classical literature throughout his life, and prided himself on his knowledge of [[Ancient Greek literature]]. He likely had an [[eidetic memory]].{{sfn|Galton|1869|p=23}} While in India, he read every ancient Greek and Roman work that was available to him. In his letters, he describes reading the ''[[Aeneid]]'' whilst on vacation in Malvern in 1851, and being moved to tears by the beauty of [[Virgil]]'s poetry. He also taught himself German, Dutch, and Spanish, and remained fluent in French.{{sfn|Sullivan|2010|p=9}}

==Political career==
In 1830 the [[Henry Petty-FitzMaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne|Marquess of Lansdowne]] invited Macaulay to become Member of Parliament for the [[Rotten and pocket boroughs|pocket borough]] of [[Calne (UK Parliament constituency)|Calne]]. His maiden speech was in favour of abolishing the [[Disabilities (Jewish)|civil disabilities of the Jews in the UK]].<ref name=ODNB>{{cite ODNB|first=William |last=Thomas|id=17349|title=Macaulay, Thomas Babington, Baron Macaulay (1800–1859), historian, essayist, and poet}}</ref>

Macaulay made his name with a series of speeches in favour of parliamentary reform.<ref name="ODNB"/> After the [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Act]] of 1833 was passed, he became MP for [[Leeds (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds]].<ref name=ODNB/> In the Reform, Calne's representation was reduced from two to one; Leeds had never been represented before, but now had two members. Though proud to have helped pass the Reform Bill, Macaulay never ceased to be grateful to his former patron, Lansdowne, who remained a great friend and political ally.

===India (1834–1838)===
[[File:Thomas Babington Macaulay, Baron Macaulay by John Partridge.jpg|thumb|Macaulay by John Partridge.]]
Macaulay was [[Secretary to the Board of Control]] under [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Lord Grey]] from 1832 until 1833. The financial embarrassment of his father meant that Macaulay became the sole means of support for his family and needed a more remunerative post than he could hold as an MP. After the passing of the [[Government of India Act 1833]], he resigned as MP for Leeds and was appointed as the first Law Member of the [[Council of India|Governor-General's Council]]. He went to India in 1834, and served on the Supreme Council of India between 1834 and 1838.{{sfn|Evans| 2002| p= 260}}

In his well-known [[English Education Act 1835|''Minute on Indian Education'']] of February 1835,<ref name="columbia.edu">For full text of Macaulay's minute see [http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00generallinks/macaulay/txt_minute_education_1835.html "Minute by the Hon'ble T. B. Macaulay, dated the 2nd February 1835"]</ref> Macaulay urged [[Lord William Bentinck]], the [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General]] to reform secondary education on [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] lines to deliver "useful learning" – a phrase that to Macaulay was synonymous with Western culture. There was no tradition of secondary education in vernacular languages; the institutions then supported by the [[Honourable East India Company|East India Company]] taught either in [[Sanskrit]] or [[Persian language|Persian]]. Hence, he argued, "We have to educate a people who cannot at present be educated by means of their mother-tongue. We must teach them some foreign language." Macaulay argued that Sanskrit and Persian were no more accessible than English to the speakers of the Indian vernacular languages and existing Sanskrit and Persian texts were of little use for 'useful learning'. In one of the less scathing passages of the Minute he wrote:
<blockquote>I have no knowledge of either Sanskrit or Arabic. But I have done what I could to form a correct estimate of their value. I have read translations of the most celebrated Arabic and Sanskrit works. I have conversed both here and at home with men distinguished by their proficiency in the Eastern tongues. I am quite ready to take the Oriental learning at the valuation of the Orientalists
themselves. I have never found one among them who could deny that a single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia.<ref name="columbia.edu" /></blockquote>

Neither [[Sanskrit]] nor [[Arabic language|Arabic]] poetry matched that of Europe; in other branches of learning the disparity was even greater, he argued:
<blockquote>It will hardly be disputed, I suppose, that the department of literature in which the Eastern writers stand highest is poetry. And I certainly never met with any orientalist who ventured to maintain that the Arabic and Sanskrit poetry could be compared to that of the great European nations. But when we pass from works of imagination to works in which facts are recorded and general principles investigated, the superiority of the Europeans becomes absolutely immeasurable. It is, I believe, no exaggeration to say that all the historical information which has been collected from all the books written in the Sanskrit language is less valuable than what may be found in the most paltry abridgments used at preparatory schools in England. In every branch of physical or moral philosophy, the relative position of the two nations is nearly the same.<ref name="columbia.edu" /></blockquote>

Hence, from the sixth year of schooling onwards, instruction should be in European learning, with English as the medium of instruction. This would create a class of anglicised Indians who would serve as cultural intermediaries between the British and the Indians; the creation of such a class was necessary before any reform of vernacular education:{{sfn|Evans| 2002| p= 260}}<ref name="columbia.edu"/><blockquote>I feel... that it is impossible for us, with our limited means, to attempt to educate the body of the people. We must at present do our best to form a class who may be interpreters between us and the millions whom we govern, – a class of persons Indian in blood and colour, but English in tastes, in opinions, in morals and in intellect. To that class we may leave it to refine the vernacular dialects of the country, to enrich those dialects with terms of science borrowed from the Western nomenclature, and to render them by degrees fit vehicles for conveying knowledge to the great mass of the population.</blockquote>

Macaulay's minute largely coincided with Bentinck's views{{sfn|Spear|1938|pp=78–101}} and Bentinck's English Education Act 1835 closely matched Macaulay's recommendations (in 1836, a school named [[La Martiniere Calcutta|La Martinière]], founded by Major General Claude Martin, had one of its houses named after him), but subsequent Governors-General took a more conciliatory approach to existing Indian education.

His final years in India were devoted to the creation of a Penal Code, as the leading member of the Law Commission. In the aftermath of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Indian Mutiny of 1857]], Macaulay's criminal law proposal was enacted.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The [[Indian Penal Code]] in 1860 was followed by the Criminal Procedure Code in 1872 and the [[Code of Civil Procedure (India)|Civil Procedure Code]] in 1908. The [[Indian Penal Code]] inspired counterparts in most other [[British colonies]], and to date many of these laws are still in effect in places as far apart as [[Pakistan]], Singapore, [[Bangladesh]], Sri Lanka, [[Nigeria]] and [[Zimbabwe]], as well as in [[India]] itself.<ref>{{cite web |title="Government of India" - A Speech Delivered in the House of Commons on the 10th of July 1833 |url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00generallinks/macaulay/txt_commons_indiagovt_1833.html |website=www.columbia.edu |publisher=Columbia university and Project Gutenberg |access-date=21 September 2018}}</ref> This includes Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which remains the basis for [[LGBT rights by country or territory|laws which criminalize homosexuality]] in several [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth nations]].<ref>{{cite web |title=377: The British colonial law that left an anti-LGBTQ legacy in Asia |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-57606847 |website=www.bbc.co.uk |publisher=BBC News |access-date=29 June 2021}}</ref>

In Indian culture, the term "Macaulay's Children" is sometimes used to refer to people born of Indian ancestry who adopt Western culture as a lifestyle, or display [[Colonial mentality#The Indian Subcontinent|attitudes influenced by colonialism]] ("[[Macaulayism]]")<ref>[https://neerajatri.in/think-it-over-macaulay-and-indias-rootless-generations Think it Over: Macaulay and India's rootless generations]</ref> – expressions used disparagingly, and with the implication of disloyalty to one's country and one's heritage. In independent India, Macaulay's idea of the [[civilising mission]] has been used by Dalitists, in particular by [[Neoliberalism|neo-liberalist]] [[Chandra Bhan Prasad]], as a "creative appropriation for self-empowerment", based on the view that the Dalit community was empowered by Macaulay's deprecation of Hindu culture and support for Western-style education IN India.{{sfn|Watt|Mann|2011|p=23}}

Domenico Losurdo states that "Macaulay acknowledged that the English colonists in India behaved like [[Sparta]]ns confronting ''[[helot]]s'': we are dealing with 'a race of sovereign' or a 'sovereign caste', wielding absolute power over its 'serfs'."{{sfn|Losurdo|2014|p=250}} Losurdo noted that this did not prompt any doubts from Macaulay over the right of Britain to administer it's colonies in an autocratic fashion; for example, while Macaulay described the administration of [[Governor-General of India|governor-general of India]] [[Warren Hastings]] as being so despotic that "all the injustice of former oppressors, Asiatic and European, appeared as a blessing", he (Hastings) deserved "high admiration" and a rank among "the most remarkable men in our history" for "having saved England and civilisation".{{sfn|Losurdo|2014|pp=250-251}}

===Return to British public life (1838–1857)===
[[File:Thomas Babington Macaulay, Baron Macaulay by Sir Francis Grant.jpg|thumb|right|Macaulay by Sir Francis Grant.]]
Returning to Britain in 1838, he became MP for [[Edinburgh (UK Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh]] in the following year. He was made [[Secretary at War]] in 1839 by [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]] and was sworn of the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]] the same year.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=19774 |date=1 October 1839 |page=1841 }}</ref> In 1841 Macaulay addressed the issue of [[copyright]] law.

In the election of 1847 he lost his seat in Edinburgh.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/344/266.html|title=Lord Macaulay|access-date=1 November 2013|publisher=Bartleby}}</ref> He attributed the loss to the anger of religious zealots over his speech in favour of expanding the annual government grant to [[Maynooth College]] in Ireland, which trained young men for the Catholic priesthood; some observers also attributed his loss to his neglect of local issues. In 1849 he was elected [[Rector of the University of Glasgow]], a position with no administrative duties, often awarded by the students to men of political or literary fame.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Rector|url=http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/officer/?id=6|publisher=Glasgow university|access-date=1 November 2013}}</ref> He also received the [[freedom of the city]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography of Lord Macaulay|url=http://www.sacklunch.net/biography/M/LordMacaulay.html|publisher=Sacklunch|access-date=1 November 2013}}</ref>

In 1852, the voters of Edinburgh offered to re-elect him to Parliament. He accepted on the express condition that he need not campaign and would not pledge himself to a position on any political issue. Remarkably, he was elected on those terms.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} He seldom attended the House due to ill health. His weakness after suffering a heart attack caused him to postpone for several months making his speech of thanks to the Edinburgh voters. He resigned his seat in January 1856.<ref name="Lord Macaulay">{{cite news|title=Lord Macaulay|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&dat=18600315&id=WFUVAAAAIBAJ&pg=6336,5147988|access-date=1 November 2013|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=15 March 1860}}</ref> In 1857 he was raised to the [[peerage]] as '''Baron Macaulay''', of [[Rothley]] in the [[Leicestershire|County of Leicester]],<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=22039 |date=11 September 1857 |page=3075 }}</ref> but seldom attended the [[House of Lords]].<ref name="Lord Macaulay"/>

[[File:The Funeral of Thomas Babington Macaulay, Baron Macaulay by Sir George Scharf.jpg|thumb|250px|''The Funeral of Thomas Babington Macaulay, Baron Macaulay'', by Sir [[George Scharf]].]]

Macaulay sat on the committee to decide on the historical subjects to be painted in the new [[Palace of Westminster]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Thomas Babington Macaulay|url=http://www.clanmacfarlanegenealogy.info/genealogy/TNGWebsite/getperson.php?personID=I48712&tree=CC|publisher=Clanmacfarlanegenealogy|access-date=25 October 2013}}</ref> The need to collect reliable portraits of notable figures from history for this project led to the foundation of the [[National Portrait Gallery (United Kingdom)|National Portrait Gallery]], which was formally established on 2 December 1856.<ref>{{cite journal |title=From the Director |url=http://www.npg.org.uk/assets/migrated_assets/docs/support/individual/face2face16.pdf |journal=Face to Face |date=Spring 2006 |issue=16 |publisher=[[National Portrait Gallery (United Kingdom)|National Portrait Gallery]] |access-date=25 October 2013}}</ref> Macaulay was amongst its founding trustees and is honoured with one of only three busts above the main entrance.

During his later years his health made work increasingly difficult for him. He died of a heart attack on 28 December 1859, aged 59, leaving his major work, ''The History of England from the Accession of James the Second'' incomplete.<ref>{{cite news |title=Death of Lord Macaulay|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1860/01/17/news/death-of-lord-macaulay.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=17 January 1960 |access-date=25 October 2013}}</ref> On 9 January 1860 he was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]], in [[Poets' Corner]],<ref>[[Arthur Penrhyn Stanley|Stanley, A.P.]], ''Historical Memorials of Westminster Abbey'' ([[London]]; [[John Murray (publishing house)|John Murray]]; [[1882]]), p. 222.</ref>  near a statue of [[Joseph Addison|Addison]].<ref name=ODNB/> As he had no children, his peerage became extinct on his death.

Macaulay's nephew, [[Sir George Trevelyan, 2nd Baronet|Sir George Trevelyan, Bt]], wrote a best-selling "Life and Letters" of his famous uncle, {{citation needed span|date=August 2021|which is still the best complete life of Macaulay}}. His great-nephew was the Cambridge historian [[G. M. Trevelyan]].

==Literary works==
As a young man he composed the ballads ''Ivry'' and ''The Armada'',{{sfn|Macaulay |1881|p=}} which he later included as part of ''[[Lays of Ancient Rome]]'', a series of very popular poems about heroic episodes in Roman history which he began composing in India and continued in Rome, finally publishing in 1842.<ref name="Sullivan">{{cite book |last1=Sullivan |first1=Robert E |title=Macaulay |date=2009 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0674054691 |page=251 |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Macaulay/hVVEtXHNup4C?hl=en&gbpv=0 |access-date=16 December 2019}}</ref> The most famous of them, ''[[s:Horatius|Horatius]]'', concerns the heroism of [[Horatius Cocles]]. It contains the oft-quoted lines:<ref>{{cite web|title=Thomas Babington Macaulay, Lord Macaulay Horatius|url=http://www.englishverse.com/poems/horatius|publisher=English verse|access-date=23 October 2013}}</ref>

{{poemquote|Then out spake brave Horatius,
The Captain of the Gate:
"To every man upon this earth
Death cometh soon or late.
And how can man die better
Than facing fearful odds,
For the ashes of his fathers,
And the temples of his gods?"}}

His essays, originally published in the ''[[Edinburgh Review]]'', were collected as ''[[Critical and Historical Essays (Macaulay)|Critical and Historical Essays]]'' in 1843.{{sfn|Macaulay|1941|p=x}}

==Historian==
During the 1840s, Macaulay undertook his most famous work, ''[[The History of England from the Accession of James the Second]]'', publishing the first two volumes in 1848. At first, he had planned to bring his history down to the reign of [[George III]]. After publication of his first two volumes, his hope was to complete his work with the death of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] in 1714.{{sfn|Macaulay|1848|loc= Vol. V, title page and prefatory "Memoir of Lord Macaulay"}}

The third and fourth volumes, bringing the history to the [[Peace of Ryswick]], were published in 1855. At his death in 1859 he was working on the fifth volume. This, bringing the ''History'' down to the death of [[William III of England|William III]], was prepared for publication by his sister, Lady Trevelyan, after his death.{{sfn|Macaulay|1848|p=}}

==Political writing==
Macaulay's political writings are famous for their ringing prose and for their confident, sometimes dogmatic, emphasis on a progressive model of British history, according to which the country threw off superstition, autocracy and confusion to create a balanced constitution and a forward-looking culture combined with freedom of belief and expression. This model of human progress has been called the [[Whig history|Whig interpretation of history]]. This philosophy appears most clearly in the essays Macaulay wrote for the ''[[Edinburgh Review]]'' and other publications, which were collected in book form and a steady best-seller throughout the 19th century. But it is also reflected in ''History''; the most stirring passages in the work are those that describe the "[[Glorious Revolution]]" of 1688.

Macaulay's approach has been criticised by later historians for its one-sidedness and its complacency. [[Karl Marx]] referred to him as a 'systematic falsifier of history'.{{sfn|Marx|1906|p=788|loc=Ch. XXVII|ps=: "I quote Macaulay, because as a systematic falsifier of history he minimizes facts of this kind as much as possible."}} His tendency to see history as a drama led him to treat figures whose views he opposed as if they were villains, while characters he approved of were presented as heroes. Macaulay goes to considerable length, for example, to absolve his main hero [[William III of England|William III]] of any responsibility for the [[Glencoe massacre]]. [[Winston Churchill]] devoted a [[Marlborough: His Life and Times|four-volume biography]] of the [[Duke of Marlborough]] to rebutting Macaulay's slights on his ancestor, expressing hope 'to fasten the label "Liar" to his genteel coat-tails.'{{sfn|Churchill|1947|p=132|ps=: "It is beyond our hopes to overtake Lord Macaulay. The grandeur and sweep of his story-telling carries him swiftly along, and with every generation he enters new fields. We can only hope that Truth will follow swiftly enough to fasten the label 'Liar' to his genteel coat-tails."}}

==Legacy as a historian==
The Liberal historian [[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Lord Acton]] read Macaulay's ''History of England'' four times and later described himself as "a raw English schoolboy, primed to the brim with Whig politics" but "not [[Whiggism]] only, but Macaulay in particular that I was so full of." However, after coming under German influence Acton would later find fault in Macaulay.{{sfn|Hill|2011|p=25}} In 1880 Acton classed Macaulay (with [[Edmund Burke|Burke]] and [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]]) as one "of the three greatest Liberals".{{sfn|Paul|1904|p=57}} In 1883, he advised [[Mary Gladstone]]:

{{quote|[T]he Essays are really flashy and superficial. He was not above par in literary criticism; his Indian articles will not hold water; and his two most famous reviews, on [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]] and [[Leopold von Ranke|Ranke]], show his incompetence. The essays are only pleasant reading, and a key to half the prejudices of our age. It is the ''History'' (with one or two speeches) that is wonderful. He knew nothing respectably before the seventeenth century, he knew nothing of foreign history, of religion, philosophy, science, or art. His account of debates has been thrown into the shade by Ranke, his account of diplomatic affairs, by [[Onno Klopp|Klopp]]. He is, I am persuaded, grossly, basely unfair. Read him therefore to find out how it comes that the most unsympathetic of critics can think him very nearly the greatest of English writers…{{sfn|Paul|1904|p=173}} }}

In 1885, Acton asserted that: {{quote|We must never judge the quality of a teaching by the quality of the Teacher, or allow the spots to shut out the sun. It would be unjust, and it would deprive us of nearly all that is great and good in this world. Let me remind you of Macaulay. He remains to me one of the greatest of all writers and masters, although I think him utterly base, contemptible and odious for certain reasons which you know.{{sfn|Paul|1904|p=210}} }}

In 1888, Acton wrote that Macaulay "had done more than any writer in the literature of the world for the propagation of the Liberal faith, and he was not only the greatest, but the most representative, Englishman then living".{{sfn|Lord Acton|1919|p=482}}

[[W. S. Gilbert]] described Macaulay's wit, "who wrote of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]" as part of Colonel Calverley's Act I patter song in the libretto of the 1881 operetta ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]''. (This line may well have been a joke about the Colonel's pseudo-intellectual bragging, as most educated Victorians knew that Macaulay did ''not'' write of Queen Anne; the ''History'' encompasses only as far as the death of William III in 1702, who was succeeded by Anne.)

[[Herbert Butterfield]]'s ''The Whig Interpretation of History'' (1931) attacked Whig history. The Dutch historian [[Pieter Geyl]], writing in 1955, considered Macaulay's ''Essays'' as "exclusively and intolerantly English".{{sfn|Geyl|1958|p=30}}

On 7 February 1954, [[Charles Wilson, 1st Baron Moran|Lord Moran]], doctor to the Prime Minister, Sir [[Winston Churchill]], recorded in his diary: {{quote|[[Randolph Churchill|Randolph]], who is writing a life of the late Lord Derby for [[Longman]]'s, brought to luncheon a young man of that name. His talk interested the P.M.&nbsp;... Macaulay, Longman went on, was not read now; there was no demand for his books. The P.M. grunted that he was very sorry to hear this. Macaulay had been a great influence in his young days.{{sfn|Lord Moran|1968|pp=553–554}}}}

[[George Richard Potter]], Professor and Head of the Department of History at the [[University of Sheffield]] from 1931 to 1965, claimed "In an age of long letters&nbsp;... Macaulay's hold their own with the best".{{sfn|Potter|1959|p=10}} However Potter also claimed: {{quote|For all his linguistic abilities he seems never to have tried to enter into sympathetic mental contact with the classical world or with the Europe of his day. It was an insularity that was impregnable&nbsp;... If his outlook was insular, however, it was surely British rather than English.{{sfn|Potter|1959|p=25}} }}

With regards to Macaulay's determination to inspect physically the places mentioned in his ''History'', Potter said: {{quote|Much of the success of the famous third chapter of the ''History'' which may be said to have introduced the study of [[social history]], and even&nbsp;... [[local history]], was due to the intense local knowledge acquired on the spot. As a result it is a superb, living picture of Great Britain in the latter half of the seventeenth century&nbsp;... No description of the [[Siege of Derry|relief of Londonderry]] in a major history of England existed before 1850; after his visit there and the narrative written round it no other account has been needed&nbsp;... Scotland came fully into its own and from then until now it has been a commonplace that [[English history]] is incomprehensible without Scotland.{{sfn|Potter|1959|p=29}} }}

Potter noted that Macaulay has had many critics, some of whom put forward some salient points about the deficiency of Macaulay's ''History'' but added: "The severity and the minuteness of the criticism to which the ''History of England'' has been subjected is a measure of its permanent value. It is worth every ounce of powder and shot that is fired against it." Potter concluded that "in the long roll of English historical writing from [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Clarendon]] to [[G. M. Trevelyan|Trevelyan]] only [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]] has surpassed him in security of reputation and certainty of immortality".{{sfn|Potter|1959|p=35}}

[[Piers Brendon]] wrote that Macaulay is "the only British rival to Gibbon."{{sfn|Brendon|2010|p=126}} In 1972, J. R. Western wrote that: "Despite its age and blemishes, Macaulay's ''History of England'' has still to be superseded by a full-scale modern history of the period."{{sfn|Western|1972|p=403}} In 1974 [[J. P. Kenyon]] stated that: "As is often the case, Macaulay had it exactly right."{{sfn|Kenyon|1974|p=47|loc=n. 14}}

[[W. A. Speck]] wrote in 1980, that a reason Macaulay's ''History of England'' "still commands respect is that it was based upon a prodigious amount of research".{{sfn|Speck|1980|p=57}} Speck claimed: {{quote|Macaulay's reputation as an historian has never fully recovered from the condemnation it implicitly received in Herbert Butterfield's devastating attack on ''The Whig Interpretation of History''. Though he was never cited by name, there can be no doubt that Macaulay answers to the charges brought against Whig historians, particularly that they study the past with reference to the present, class people in the past as those who furthered progress and those who hindered it, and judge them accordingly.{{sfn|Speck|1980|p=64}} }}

According to Speck: {{quote|[Macaulay too often] denies the past has its own validity, treating it as being merely a prelude to his own age. This is especially noticeable in the third chapter of his ''History of England'', when again and again he contrasts the backwardness of 1685 with the advances achieved by 1848. Not only does this misuse the past, it also leads him to exaggerate the differences.{{sfn|Speck|1980|p= 64}} }}

On the other hand, Speck also wrote that Macaulay "took pains to present the virtues even of a rogue, and he painted the virtuous warts and all",{{sfn|Speck|1980|p=65}} and that "he was never guilty of suppressing or distorting evidence to make it support a proposition which he knew to be untrue".{{sfn|Speck|1980|p=67}} Speck concluded: {{quote|What is in fact striking is the extent to which his ''History of England'' at least has survived subsequent research. Although it is often dismissed as inaccurate, it is hard to pinpoint a passage where he is categorically in error&nbsp;... his account of events has stood up remarkably well&nbsp;... His interpretation of the [[Glorious Revolution]] also remains the essential starting point for any discussion of that episode&nbsp;... What has not survived, or has become subdued, is Macaulay's confident belief in progress. It was a dominant creed in the era of the [[Great Exhibition]]. But [[Auschwitz]] and [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima]] destroyed this century's claim to moral superiority over its predecessors, while the exhaustion of natural resources raises serious doubts about the continuation even of material progress into the next.{{sfn|Speck|1980|p=67}} }}

In 1981, [[J. W. Burrow]] argued that Macaulay's ''History of England'': {{quote|...&nbsp;is not simply partisan; a judgement, like that of [[Charles Harding Firth|Firth]], that Macaulay was always the Whig politician could hardly be more inapposite. Of course Macaulay thought that the Whigs of the seventeenth century were correct in their fundamental ideas, but the hero of the ''History'' was William, who, as Macaulay says, was certainly no Whig&nbsp;... If this was [[Whiggism]] it was so only, by the mid-nineteenth century, in the most extended and inclusive sense, requiring only an acceptance of parliamentary government and a sense of gravity of precedent. [[Herbert Butterfield|Butterfield]] says, rightly, that in the nineteenth century the Whig view of history became the English view. The chief agent of that transformation was surely Macaulay, aided, of course, by the receding relevance of seventeenth-century conflicts to contemporary politics, as the power of the crown waned further, and the [[civil disabilities of Catholics]] and [[English Dissenters|Dissenters]] were removed by legislation. The ''History'' is much more than the vindication of a party; it is an attempt to insinuate a view of politics, pragmatic, reverent, essentially [[Edmund Burke|Burkean]], informed by a high, even tumid sense of the worth of public life, yet fully conscious of its interrelations with the wider progress of society; it embodies what [[Henry Hallam|Hallam]] had merely asserted, a sense of the privileged possession by Englishmen of their history, as well as of the epic dignity of government by discussion. If this was sectarian it was hardly, in any useful contemporary sense, polemically Whig; it is more like the sectarianism of English respectability.{{sfn|Burrow|1983|p=}} }}

In 1982, [[Gertrude Himmelfarb]] wrote: {{quote|[M]ost professional historians have long since given up reading Macaulay, as they have given up writing the kind of history he wrote and thinking about history as he did. Yet there was a time when anyone with any pretension to cultivation read Macaulay.{{sfn|Himmelfarb|1986|p=163}} }} Himmelfarb also laments that "the history of the ''History'' is a sad testimonial to the cultural regression of our times".{{sfn|Himmelfarb|1986|p=165}}

In the novel ''[[Marathon Man (novel)|Marathon Man]]'' and its [[Marathon Man (film)|film adaptation]], the protagonist was named 'Thomas Babington' after Macaulay.{{sfn|Goldman|1974|p=20}}

In 2008, [[Walter Olson]] argued for the pre-eminence of Macaulay as a British [[classical liberal]].{{sfn|Olson|2008|pp=309–310}}
