'''Robert Lee Frost''' (March{{nbsp}}26, 1874{{snd}}January{{nbsp}}29, 1963) was an [[American poetry|American poet]]. His work was initially published in England before it was published in the United States. Known for his realistic depictions of rural life and his command of American [[Colloquialism|colloquial speech]],<ref name=britannica>{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Britannica | title=Robert Frost | url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9035504/Robert-Frost | edition=Online | year=2008 | access-date=2008-12-21}}</ref> Frost frequently wrote about settings from rural life in [[New England]] in the early 20th century, using them to examine complex social and philosophical themes.

Frost was honored frequently during his lifetime and is the only poet to receive four [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry|Pulitzer Prizes for Poetry]]. He became one of America's rare "public literary figures, almost an artistic institution".<ref name="Stine 1983 110">''Contemporary Literary Criticism''. Ed. Jean C. Stine, Bridget Broderick, and Daniel G. Marowski. Vol. 26. Detroit: Gale Research, 1983. p 110.</ref> He was awarded the [[Congressional Gold Medal]] in 1960 for his poetic works. On July 22, 1961, Frost was named [[poet laureate]] of [[Vermont]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
[[File:Robert Frost, 1910s.jpg|left|thumb|Robert Frost, circa 1910]]
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Robert frost.png|left|thumb|Robert Frost, circa 1911]] -->

Robert Frost was born in [[San Francisco, California]], to journalist William Prescott Frost, Jr., and Isabelle Moodie.<ref name=britannica/> His father descended from Nicholas Frost of [[Tiverton, Devon]], England, who had sailed to [[New Hampshire]] in 1634 on the ''Wolfrana'', and his mother was a Scottish immigrant.

Frost was a descendant of [[Samuel Appleton (born 1625)|Samuel Appleton]], one of the early settlers of [[Ipswich, Massachusetts]], and [[George Phillips (Watertown)|Rev. George Phillips]], one of the early settlers of [[Watertown, Massachusetts]].<ref>Watson, Marsten. Royal Families - Americans of Royal and Noble Ancestry. Volume Three: Samuel Appleton and His Wife Judith Everard and Five Generations of Their Descendants. 2010</ref>

Frost's father was a teacher and later an editor of the ''[[San Francisco Evening Bulletin]]'' (which later merged with ''[[The San Francisco Examiner]]''), and an unsuccessful candidate for city tax collector. After his death on May 5, 1885, the family moved across the country to [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]], under the patronage of Robert's grandfather William Frost, Sr., who was an overseer at a New England mill. Frost graduated from [[Lawrence High School (Massachusetts)|Lawrence High School]] in 1892.<ref>{{cite book | last=Ehrlich | first=Eugene | author2=Carruth, Gorton | title=The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States | volume=vol. 50 | location=New York | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1982 | isbn=0-19-503186-5 | url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordillustrate00euge }}</ref> Frost's mother joined the [[The New Church|Swedenborgian]] church and had him baptized in it, but he left it as an adult.

Although known for his later association with rural life, Frost grew up in the city, and he published his first poem in his high school's magazine. He attended [[Dartmouth College]] for two months, long enough to be accepted into the [[Theta Delta Chi]] fraternity. Frost returned home to teach and to work at various jobs, including helping his mother teach her class of unruly boys, delivering newspapers, and working in a factory maintaining [[carbon arc lamp]]s. He did not enjoy these jobs, feeling his true calling was poetry.

===Adult years===
[[File:Robert Frost NYWTS 5.jpg|thumb|right|Robert Frost's 85th birthday in 1959]]
 
In 1894, he sold his first poem, "My Butterfly. An Elegy" (published in the November 8, 1894, edition of the ''New York Independent'') for $15 (${{Inflation|US|15|1894}} today). Proud of his accomplishment, he proposed marriage to Elinor Miriam White, but she demurred, wanting to finish college (at [[St. Lawrence University]]) before they married. Frost then went on an excursion to the [[Great Dismal Swamp]] in [[Virginia]] and asked Elinor again upon his return. Having graduated, she agreed, and they were married at Lawrence, Massachusetts on December 19, 1895.

Frost attended [[Harvard University]] from 1897 to 1899, but he left voluntarily due to illness.<ref name="TutenZubizarreta2001">{{cite book|author1=Nancy Lewis Tuten|author2=John Zubizarreta|title=The Robert Frost encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=47NFEPDDBMgC&pg=PA146|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-29464-8|page=145|quote=Halfway through the spring semester of his second year, Dean Briggs released him from Harvard without prejudice, lamenting the loss of so good a student.}}</ref><ref name="Parini2000">{{cite book|author=Jay Parini|title=Robert Frost: A Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rHWqRHJiAlwC&pg=PA12-IA9|year=2000|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-8050-6341-7|pages=64–65}}</ref><ref name="Meyers1996">{{cite book|author=Jeffrey Meyers|title=Robert Frost: a biography|url=https://archive.org/details/robertfrost00jeff|url-access=registration|year=1996|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|isbn=9780395856031|quote=Frost remained at Harvard until March of his sophomore year, when he decamped in the middle of a term&nbsp;...}}</ref> Shortly before his death, Frost's grandfather purchased [[Robert Frost Farm (Derry, New Hampshire)|a farm]] for Robert and Elinor in [[Derry, New Hampshire]]; Frost worked the farm for nine years while writing early in the mornings and producing many of the poems that would later become famous. Ultimately his farming proved unsuccessful and he returned to the field of education as an English teacher at New Hampshire's [[Pinkerton Academy]] from 1906 to 1911, then at the New Hampshire Normal School (now [[Plymouth State University]]) in [[Plymouth, New Hampshire]].

In 1912, Frost sailed with his family to [[Great Britain]], settling first in [[Beaconsfield]], a small town in [[Buckinghamshire]] outside London. His first book of poetry, ''[[A Boy's Will]]'', was published the next year. In England he made some important acquaintances, including [[Edward Thomas (poet)|Edward Thomas]] (a member of the group known as the [[Dymock poets]] and Frost's inspiration for "[[The Road Not Taken]]"<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Road Not Taken: Finding America in the Poem Everyone Loves and Almost Everyone Gets Wrong|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DQMbBQAAQBAJ|publisher = Penguin|date = 2015-08-18|isbn = 9780698140899|language = en|first = David|last = Orr}}</ref>), [[T. E. Hulme]], and [[Ezra Pound]]. Although Pound would become the first American to write a favorable review of Frost's work, Frost later resented Pound's attempts to manipulate his American [[metre (poetry)|prosody]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Jeffrey |title=Robert Frost: A Biography |date=1996 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |isbn=9780395728093 |pages=107–109}}</ref> Frost met or befriended many contemporary poets in England, especially after his first two poetry volumes were published in London in 1913 (''A Boy's Will'') and 1914 (''[[North of Boston]]'').

[[File:Robertfrostfarm.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Robert Frost Farm (Derry, New Hampshire)|Robert Frost Farm]] in [[Derry, New Hampshire]], where he wrote many of his poems, including "Tree at My Window" and "Mending Wall".]]

In 1915, during [[World War I]], Frost returned to America, where [[Henry Holt and Company|Holt's]] American edition of ''A Boy's Will'' had recently been published, and bought a farm in [[Franconia, New Hampshire]], where he launched a career of writing, teaching, and lecturing. This family homestead served as the Frosts' summer home until 1938. It is maintained today as [[The Frost Place]], a museum and poetry conference site. He was made an honorary member of [[Phi Beta Kappa]] at Harvard<ref>{{Cite journal|date=1926|jstor=42914052|journal=The Phi Beta Kappa Key|volume=6|issue=4|pages=237–240|title=Phi Beta Kappa Authors}}</ref> in 1916. During the years 1917–20, 1923–25, and, on a more informal basis, 1926–1938, Frost taught English at [[Amherst College]] in Massachusetts, notably encouraging his students to account for the myriad sounds and intonations of the spoken English language in their writing. He called his colloquial approach to language "the sound of sense."<ref name="www.learner.org series57">{{cite web|url=http://www.learner.org/resources/series57.html|title=Resource: Voices & Visions|website=www.learner.org|access-date=2018-03-22}}</ref>

In 1924, he won the first of four [[Pulitzer Prizes]] for the book ''[[New Hampshire (poetry collection)|New Hampshire: A Poem with Notes and Grace Notes]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/robert-frost|title=The 1924 Pulitzer Prize Winner in Poetry|website=Pulitzer.org|access-date=2018-03-22}}</ref> He would win additional Pulitzers for ''[[Collected Poems of Robert Frost|Collected Poems]]'' in 1931,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/robert-frost-0|title=The 1931 Pulitzer Prize Winner in Poetry|website=Pulitzer.org|access-date=2018-03-22}}</ref> ''[[A Further Range]]'' in 1937,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/robert-frost-1|title=The 1937 Pulitzer Prize Winner in Poetry|website=Pulitzer.org|access-date=2018-03-22}}</ref> and ''A Witness Tree'' in 1943.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/robert-frost-2|title=The 1943 Pulitzer Prize Winner in Poetry|website=Pulitzer.org|access-date=2018-03-22}}</ref>

For forty-two years&nbsp;– from 1921 to 1962&nbsp;– Frost spent almost every summer and fall teaching at the [[Bread Loaf School of English]] of [[Middlebury College]], at its mountain campus at [[Ripton, Vermont]]. He is credited as a major influence upon the development of the school and its writing programs. The college now owns and maintains his former Ripton farmstead, a [[National Historic Landmark]], near the Bread Loaf campus.<ref>{{cite web |title=A Brief History of the Bread Loaf School of English |url=http://www.middlebury.edu/blse/about/history |website=Middlebury Bread Loaf School of English |access-date=February 11, 2018}}</ref> In 1921, Frost accepted a fellowship teaching post at the [[University of Michigan]], [[Ann Arbor]], where he resided until 1927 when he returned to teach at Amherst. While teaching at the University of Michigan, he was awarded a lifetime appointment at the university as a Fellow in Letters.<ref name = Frost/> The Robert Frost Ann Arbor home was purchased by [[The Henry Ford]] Museum in Dearborn, Michigan and relocated to the museum's Greenfield Village site for public tours. Throughout the 1920s, Frost also lived in his [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial era]] home in [[Shaftsbury, Vermont]]. The home opened as the Robert Frost Stone House Museum<ref name="stone_house">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bennington.edu/robert-frost-stone-house-museum|title=Robert Frost Stone House Museum &#124; Bennington College|website=www.bennington.edu}}</ref> in 2002 and was given to [[Bennington College]] in 2017.<ref name="stone_house"/>

In 1934, Frost began to spend winter months in Florida.<ref name="Helen Muir" /> In March 1935, he gave a talk at the [[University of Miami]].<ref name="Helen Muir" /> In 1940, he bought a {{convert|5|acre|adj=on}} plot in South Miami, Florida, naming it ''Pencil Pines''; he spent his winters there for the rest of his life.<ref name="Helen Muir">{{cite book|title=Frost in Florida: a memoir|last=Muir|first=Helen|publisher=Valiant Press|year=1995|isbn=0-9633461-6-4|pages=11, 17}}</ref> In her memoir about Frost's time in Florida, [[Helen Muir (reporter)|Helen Muir]] writes, "Frost had called his five acres ''Pencil Pines'' because he said he had never made a penny from anything that did not involve the use of a pencil."<ref name="Helen Muir" /> His properties also included a [[Robert Frost House|house]] on Brewster Street in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].

[[Harvard University|Harvard]]'s 1965 alumni directory indicates Frost received an [[honorary degree]] there. Although he never graduated from college, Frost received over 40 honorary degrees, including ones from [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Oxford University|Oxford]] and [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] universities, and was the only person to receive two honorary degrees from [[Dartmouth College]]. During his lifetime, the Robert Frost Middle School in [[Fairfax, Virginia]], the Robert L. Frost School in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]], and the main library of [[Amherst College]] were named after him.

In 1960, Frost was awarded a United States [[Congressional Gold Medal]], "In recognition of his poetry, which has enriched the culture of the United States and the philosophy of the world,"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://artandhistory.house.gov/house_history/goldmedal.aspx|title=Office of the Clerk – U.S. House of Representatives, Congressional Gold Medal Recipients}}</ref> which was finally bestowed by President Kennedy in March 1962.<ref name=Parini1999>{{cite book |last=Parini |first=Jay |author-link=Jay Parini |title=Robert Frost: A Life |url=https://archive.org/details/robertfrostlife00pari |url-access=registration |year=1999 |location=New York |publisher=[[Henry Holt and Company]] |pages=[https://archive.org/details/robertfrostlife00pari/page/408 408], 424–425 |isbn=9780805063417}}</ref> Also in 1962, he was awarded the [[Edward MacDowell Medal]] for outstanding contribution to the arts by the [[MacDowell Colony]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.macdowellcolony.org/events-MedalDay.html |title=The MacDowell Colony – Medal Day |access-date=2015-07-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161106114133/http://macdowellcolony.org/events-MedalDay.html |archive-date=2016-11-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Frost was 86 when he read at the [[inauguration of John F. Kennedy]] on January 20, 1961. Frost originally attempted to read his poem "Dedication", which was written for the occasion, but was unable to read it due to the brightness of the sunlight, so he recited his poem "[[The Gift Outright]]" from memory instead.<ref>"John F. Kennedy: A Man of This Century". ''CBS''. November 22, 1963.</ref>

In the summer of 1962, Frost accompanied Interior Secretary [[Stewart Udall]] on a visit to the Soviet Union in hopes of meeting [[Nikita Khrushchev]] to lobby for peaceful relations between the two Cold War powers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.jfkthelastspeech.org/frost-the-poet-politician/|title=The Poet - Politician - JFK The Last Speech|work=JFK The Last Speech|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/99/04/25/specials/frost-last.html|title=Robert Frost's Last Adventure|last=Udall|first=Stewart L.|date=1972-06-11|website=archive.nytimes.com|access-date=2018-10-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/Books/2008/0408/p13s01-bogn.html|title=When Robert Frost met Khrushchev|date=2008-04-08|work=Christian Science Monitor|access-date=2018-10-25|issn=0882-7729}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/listen-2|title=Remembering John F.

Frost died in Boston on January 29, 1963, of complications from prostate surgery. He was buried at the Old Bennington Cemetery in Bennington, Vermont. His [[epitaph]] quotes the last line from his poem, "The Lesson for Today" (1942): "I had a lover's quarrel with the world."

One of the original collections of Frost materials, to which he himself contributed, is found in the Special Collections department of the [[Jones Library]] in [[Amherst, Massachusetts]]. The collection consists of approximately twelve thousand items, including original manuscript poems and letters, correspondence and photographs, as well as audio and visual recordings.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.joneslibrary.org/specialcollections/collections/frost/frost_print.html#contact |title=Robert Frost Collection |publisher=Jones Library, Inc. website, Amherst, Massachusetts |access-date=2009-03-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612052023/http://www.joneslibrary.org/specialcollections/collections/frost/frost_print.html#contact |archive-date=2009-06-12 }}</ref> The Archives and Special Collections at Amherst College holds a small collection of his papers.

===Personal life===
[[File:Robert Frost's Grave.JPG|thumb|The Frost family grave in Bennington Old Cemetery]]

Robert Frost's personal life was plagued by grief and loss. In 1885 when he was 11, his father died of [[tuberculosis]], leaving the family with just eight dollars. Frost's mother died of [[cancer]] in 1900. In 1920, he had to commit his younger sister Jeanie to a mental hospital, where she died nine years later. Mental illness apparently ran in Frost's family, as both he and his mother suffered from [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], and his daughter Irma was committed to a mental hospital in 1947. Frost's wife, Elinor, also experienced bouts of depression.<ref name = Frost/>

Elinor and Robert Frost had six children: son Elliot (1896–1900, died of [[cholera]]); daughter Lesley Frost Ballantine (1899–1983); son Carol (1902–1940); daughter Irma (1903–1967); daughter Marjorie (1905–1934, died as a result of [[puerperal fever]] after childbirth); and daughter Elinor Bettina (died just one day after her birth in 1907). Only Lesley and Irma outlived their father. Frost's wife, who had heart problems throughout her life, developed [[breast cancer]] in 1937, and died of [[heart failure]] in 1938.<ref name="Frost">{{cite book |last=Frost |first=Robert |editor1-last=Poirier |editor1-first=Richard |editor2-last=Richardson |editor2-first=Mark |title=Collected Poems, Prose, & Plays |series=The Library of America |volume=81 |location=New York |publisher=Library of America |year=1995 |isbn=1-883011-06-X |url=https://archive.org/details/collectedpoemspr00fros }}</ref>

===Style and critical reception===
The poet and critic [[Randall Jarrell]] often praised Frost's poetry and wrote "Robert Frost, along with [[Wallace Stevens|Stevens]] and [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]], seems to me the greatest of the American poets of this century. Frost's virtues are extraordinary. No other living poet has written so well about the actions of ordinary men; his wonderful dramatic monologues or dramatic scenes come out of a knowledge of people that few poets have had, and they are written in a verse that uses, sometimes with absolute mastery, the rhythms of actual speech". He also praised "Frost's seriousness and honesty", stating that Frost was particularly skilled at representing a wide range of human experience in his poems.<ref>Jarrell, Randall. "Fifty Years of American Poetry." ''No Other Book: Selected Essays''. New York: HarperCollins, 1999.</ref>

Jarrell's notable and influential essays on Frost include the essays "Robert Frost's 'Home Burial'" (1962), which consisted of an extended close reading of that particular poem,<ref>{{cite web |last=Jarrell |first=Randall |title=On 'Home Burial' |url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/frost/burial.htm |year=1999 |orig-year=1962 |website=English Department at the University of Illinois |access-date=October 18, 2018}}</ref> and "To The Laodiceans" (1952) in which Jarrell defended Frost against critics who had accused Frost of being too "traditional" and out of touch with Modern or [[Modernist poetry]].[[File:RobertFrost.jpg|thumb|left|160px|U.S stamp, 1974]] In Frost's defense, Jarrell wrote "the regular ways of looking at Frost's poetry are grotesque simplifications, distortions, falsifications—coming to know his poetry well ought to be enough, in itself, to dispel any of them, and to make plain the necessity of finding some other way of talking about his work." And Jarrell's close readings of poems like "Neither Out Too Far Nor In Too Deep" led readers and critics to perceive more of the complexities in Frost's poetry.<ref>Jarrell, Randall. "To The Laodiceans." ''No Other Book: Selected Essays''. New York: HarperCollins, 1999.</ref><ref>Jarrell, Randall. "Robert Frost's 'Home Burial.'" ''No Other Book: Selected Essays''. New York: HarperCollins, 1999.</ref>

In an introduction to Jarrell's book of essays, [[Brad Leithauser]] notes that "the 'other' Frost that Jarrell discerned behind the genial, homespun New England rustic—the 'dark' Frost who was desperate, frightened, and brave—has become the Frost we've all learned to recognize, and the little-known poems Jarrell singled out as central to the Frost canon are now to be found in most anthologies".<ref>Leithauser, Brad.

In 2003, the critic Charles McGrath noted that critical views on Frost's poetry have changed over the years (as has his public image). In an article called "The Vicissitudes of Literary Reputation," McGrath wrote, "Robert Frost&nbsp;... at the time of his death in 1963 was generally considered to be a New England folkie&nbsp;... In 1977, the third volume of Lawrance Thompson's biography suggested that Frost was a much nastier piece of work than anyone had imagined; a few years later, thanks to the reappraisal of critics like William H. Pritchard and [[Harold Bloom]] and of younger poets like [[Joseph Brodsky]], he bounced back again, this time as a bleak and unforgiving modernist."<ref>McGrath, Charles. "The Vicissitudes of Literary Reputation." ''The New York Times Magazine''. 15 June 2003.</ref>

In ''The Norton Anthology of Modern Poetry'', editors [[Richard Ellmann]] and Robert O'Clair compared and contrasted Frost's unique style to the work of the poet [[Edwin Arlington Robinson]] since they both frequently used New England settings for their poems. However, they state that Frost's poetry was "less [consciously] literary" and that this was possibly due to the influence of English and Irish writers like [[Thomas Hardy]] and [[W.B. Yeats]]. They note that Frost's poems "show a successful striving for utter colloquialism" and always try to remain down to earth, while at the same time using traditional forms despite the trend of American poetry towards free verse which Frost famously said was "'like playing tennis without a net.'"<ref name="Ellman 1988.">Ellman, Richard and Robert O'Clair. ''The Norton Anthology of Modern Poetry'', Second Edition. New York: Norton, 1988.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Faggen|first1=Robert|title=Editor|date=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|edition=First}}</ref>

In providing an overview of Frost's style, the [[Poetry Foundation]] makes the same point, placing Frost's work "at the crossroads of nineteenth-century American poetry [with regard to his use of traditional forms] and modernism [with his use of idiomatic language and ordinary, everyday subject matter]." They also note that Frost believed that "the self-imposed restrictions of meter in form" was more helpful than harmful because he could focus on the content of his poems instead of concerning himself with creating "innovative" new verse forms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/robert-frost|title=Robert Frost|date=2018-03-21|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=2018-03-22}}</ref>

An earlier 1963 study by the poet [[James Radcliffe Squires]] spoke to the distinction of Frost as a poet whose verse soars more for the difficulty and skill by which he attains his final visions, than for the philosophical purity of the visions themselves. "He has written at a time when the choice for the poet seemed to lie among the forms of despair: Science, solipsism, or the religion of the past century ... Frost has refused all of these and in the refusal has long seemed less dramatically committed than others ... But no, he must be seen as dramatically uncommitted to the single solution ... Insofar as Frost allows to both fact and intuition a bright kingdom, he speaks for many of us.  Insofar as he speaks through an amalgam of senses and sure experience so that his poetry seems a nostalgic memory with overtones touching some conceivable future, he speaks better than most of us. That is to say, as a poet must."<ref>Squires, Radcliffe.  The Major Themes of Robert Frost, The University of Michigan Press, 1963.  pp. 106-107.</ref>

The classicist [[Helen H. Bacon]] has proposed that Frost's deep knowledge of Greek and Roman classics influenced much of his work. Frost's education at Lawrence High School, Dartmouth, and Harvard "was based mainly on the classics". As examples, she links imagery and action in Frost's early poems "Birches" (1915) and "Wild Grapes" (1920) with Euripides' ''[[Bacchae]]''. She cites certain motifs, including that of the tree bent down to earth, as evidence of his "very attentive reading of ''Bacchae'', almost certainly in Greek". In a later poem, "One More Brevity" (1953), Bacon compares the poetic techniques used by Frost to those of Virgil in the ''[[Aeneid]]''. She notes that "this sampling of the ways Frost drew on the literature and concepts of the Greek and Roman world at every stage of his life indicates how imbued with it he was".<ref>Bacon, Helen.

In ''Contemporary Literary Criticism'', the editors state that "Frost's best work explores fundamental questions of existence, depicting with chilling starkness the loneliness of the individual in an indifferent universe."<ref name="Stine 1983 110 129">''Contemporary Literary Criticism''. Ed. Jean C. Stine, Bridget Broderick, and Daniel G. Marowski. Vol. 26. Detroit: Gale Research, 1983. p&nbsp;110–129.</ref> The critic T. K. Whipple focused on this bleakness in Frost's work, stating that "in much of his work, particularly in ''North of Boston'', his harshest book, he emphasizes the dark background of life in rural New England, with its degeneration often sinking into total madness."<ref name="Stine 1983 110 129"/>

In sharp contrast, the founding publisher and editor of ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'', [[Harriet Monroe]], emphasized the folksy New England persona and characters in Frost's work, writing that "perhaps no other poet in our history has put the best of the Yankee spirit into a book so completely."<ref name="Stine 1983 110 129"/> She notes his frequent use of rural settings and farm life, and she likes that in these poems, Frost is most interested in "showing the human reaction to nature's processes." She also notes that while Frost's narrative, character-based poems are often satirical, Frost always has a "sympathetic humor" towards his subjects.<ref name="Stine 1983 110 129"/>
