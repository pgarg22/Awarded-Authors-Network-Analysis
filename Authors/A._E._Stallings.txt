She is a frequent contributor of poems and essays to ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry magazine]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/ae-stallings|title=A. E. Stallings|work=poetryfoundation.org|access-date=26 August 2015}}</ref> and the [[The Times Literary Supplement|Times Literary Supplement]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.the-tls.co.uk/?s=A.%20E.%20STALLINGS|title=You searched for A. E. STALLINGS – TheTLS|website=TheTLS|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-10-13}}</ref>  Her work has been published in [[The New Yorker]], [[The Atlantic]], [[The New York Review of Books]], [[The Times Literary Supplement]], [[The Sewanee Review]], [[Beloit Poetry Journal]], and many other publications. She has published four books of original verse: ''Archaic Smile'' (1999), ''Hapax'' (2006), ''Olives'' (2012) and ''Like'' (2018).

==Critical response==
[[Christopher Ricks|Sir Christopher Ricks]], widely regarded as the greatest living critic of English-language poetry<sup>{{by whom|date=November 2021}}</sup>, writes: "The poems of A.E.Stallings are never less than the true voice of feeling, and always more...she is able to realize in her poems the myriad minds of Europe."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ricks|url=https://aestallings.wixsite.com/aestallings/ricks|access-date=2020-07-13|website=aestallings|language=en}}</ref> In 2015, Ricks nominated Stallings to be the [[Oxford Professor of Poetry]]. The MacArthur Fellowship committee praised her "mastery" of poetic form, declaring that: "[t]hrough her technical dexterity and graceful fusion of content and form, Stallings is revealing the timelessness of poetic expression and antiquity's relevance for today."<ref>{{Cite web|title=A. E. Stallings - MacArthur Foundation|url=https://www.macfound.org/fellows/19/|access-date=2020-07-13|website=www.macfound.org}}</ref>

In a review for her book ''Archaic Smile'', [[Able Muse]], a formalist online poetry journal, noted that, "For all of Stallings' formal virtuosity, few of her poems are strictly metrically regular. Indeed, one of the pleasant surprises of ''Archaic Smile'' is the number of superb poems in the gray zone between free and blank verse."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ablemuse.com/v3/amjuster-stallings.htm|title=Archaic Smile by A. E. Stallings - reviewed by A. M. Juster - Poetry at Able Muse - Symposium Issue|work=ablemuse.com|access-date=26 August 2015}}</ref> Her work has been favorably compared to the poetry of [[Richard Wilbur]] and [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]].<ref name="poetryfoundation.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/article/178921|title=Eight Takes: Fenton, Strand, Hopler, Zukofsky, Stallings, Voigt, Kinnell, Wojahn|work=poetryfoundation.org|access-date=26 August 2015}}</ref>
In a review of her second book, ''Hapax'', [[Peter Campion]] critically wrote that, "The meter and rhyme unfold elegantly, but at the expense of idiom," a criticism that is commonly aimed at the Formalist poets. On a positive note, Campion also states that, "[her best poems in the collection] match prosodic talent with intensely rendered feelings."<ref name="poetryfoundation.org" /> In a review for her collection ''Olives'', ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' stated that they were most impressed with those poems that were not responses to ancient mythology, noting, "When she unleashes her technical gifts upon poems in which she builds a new narrative instead of building upon an old one, Stallings achieves a restrained, stark poise that is threatening even by New Formalism standards."
