==Early life and education==
O'Shaughnessy was born in St Thomas's Hospital in [[London]], opposite the [[Houses of Parliament]]. At the age of three, he started school at English Martyrs' near the [[Elephant and Castle]] where he lived. When he was six, he moved with his parents and younger brother, to [[Limerick]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], where he has lived ever since.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://www.darrenshan.com/about|title=About Darren|website=www.darrenshan.com|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>

He received his primary education in [[Askeaton]], and attended secondary school at [[Copsewood College]], [[Pallaskenry]], graduating in 1989. He returned to London in 1990 to pursue a degree in Sociology and English from [[Roehampton University|Roehampton Institute of Higher Education]].<ref name=":3" />

==Career==
O'Shaughnessy bought his first [[typewriter]] when he was fourteen and wrote many short stories, comic scripts, and books that he never finished, many of which are unpublished. O'Shaughnessy claims that most of these stories will never be published. His first success came to him at age fifteen, when he was a runner-up in a TV script-writing competition for [[Raidi√≥ Teilif√≠s √âireann|RT√â]] in Ireland, with a [[Black comedy|dark comedy]] story entitled ''A Day in the Morgue''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Joshi|first=S. T.|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=9780313378348|title=Encyclopedia of the Vampire: The Living Dead in Myth, Legend, and Popular Culture|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2010|isbn=978-0-313-37834-8|location=Santa Barbara, California|pages=289|language=en}}</ref>

After university, O'Shaughnessy worked in a TV cable company in Limerick for two years, before becoming a full-time writer at the age of 23. His breakthrough came with ''Ayuamarca'', published in February 1999 by [[Orion Publishing Group]] under his full name.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.christopherlittle.net/authors/darren-shan/|title=Darren Shan|website=Christopher Little|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-05-27}}</ref> The sequel, ''Hell's Horizon'', was published in February 2000. ''Ayuamarca'' was re-released in March 2008 under the title ''Procession of the Dead'' and the pen-name ''D.B. Shan''. ''Hell's Horizon'' followed in March 2009, and the third in the trilogy, ''City of the Snakes'' in March 2010 (but this time under the name of [[Darren Shan]]). In January 2000, Shan released ''[[Cirque du Freak]]'', the first book of ''[[The Saga of Darren Shan]]'' series in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The series was a huge global success and by 2021 his books were on sale in 40 countries, in 32 languages, and had sold thirty million copies worldwide.<ref name=":0" />

O'Shaughnessy signed up with the [[Christopher Little Literary Agency]] in 1996 and they continued to represent him until Christopher Little's death in 2021. He is now represented by the [[Curtis Brown (agency)|Curtis Brown Agency]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.christopherlittle.net/about/|title=About The agency|work=Christopher Little|access-date=2020-04-04|language=en-GB}}</ref>

==Personal life==
O'Shaughnessy continues to live in [[Pallaskenry]] in [[Limerick]], Ireland with his wife Helen Basini, a freelance university lecturer and global aid specialist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ulsites.ul.ie/gcs/helen-basini-profile|title=Helen Basini Profile|website=University of Limerick|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref><ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/artsfilmtv/darren-shan-a-damned-good-storyteller-293346.html|title=Darren Shan: A damned good storyteller|last=Sheridan|first=Colette|date=2014-10-22|website=Irish Examiner|language=en|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> On 23 September 2014, the couple celebrated the birth of their first child, Dante, named after the famous Italian author.<ref name=":4" /> Shan and his wife Helen welcomed their second child, a daughter named Gaia, on 26 March 2019.<ref>{{Cite tweet|number=1110512324706816000|user=darrenshan|title=Gaia Shan was safely delivered on the maternity wing of Vampire Mountain early this morning.

===Unpublished books===
In July 2009, O'Shaughnessy revealed that he had written first drafts of 53 books in total. Most of those have now been published, although there are several which have yet to see the light of day, which he plans to release in the future, most probably under his [[Darren Dash]] umbrella. There are also a few that will very likely never be published. O'Shaughnessy has not revealed details of any of his unpublished books, with two exceptions ‚Äî ''Mute Pursuit'' and ''The Cannibal King'':

# ''Mute Pursuit'' ‚Äì A futuristic cross between ''[[The Terminator]]'' and [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]''; this was Shan's first completed book at age seventeen.

# ''The Cannibal King'' ‚Äì This was originally going to be the 12th book of ''The Saga of Darren Shan'' ‚Äì book 11 was originally meant to be much longer, including elements from the first half of what became ''Sons of Destiny''. ''The Cannibal King'' was never published because it was originally part of the planned 24-book Saga. Shan had planned to write 18‚Äî24 books for The Saga, with half of them taking place in the future wasteworld shown in Book 10, ''The Lake of Souls''. For reasons explained on his web site, Shan decided to end the series with ''Sons of Destiny'', which was written and released instead of ''The Cannibal King''. He never reveals anything that he wrote in this book, because there is a possibility that he might one day write a follow-up series to The Saga, which would take parts of this book as its starting point.

==Television and film==
[[Universal Studios]] bought the film rights to the first three books of ''[[The Saga of Darren Shan]]'' and combined them to make a single film, ''[[Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant]]'', released in the US on 23 October 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/2009/10/23/cirque-du-freak-vampires-assistant-2/|title=Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant|last=Schwarzbaum|first=Lisa|date=2009-10-23|website=EW.com|language=EN|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> [[Lauren Shuler Donner]] produced the film and [[Paul Weitz (filmmaker)|Paul Weitz]] directed.
