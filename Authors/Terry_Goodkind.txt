Goodkind was a proponent of [[Ayn Rand]]'s philosophical approach of [[Objectivism]],<ref name = gelder>{{cite book |author=Gelder K|title=Popular fiction: the logics and practices of a literary field |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2004 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=7VHERzW1-LMC&pg=PA157#v=onepage&q&f=false 157n2]|isbn=0-415-35646-6 }}</ref><ref name = USAToday/> and made references to Rand's ideas and novels in his works.<ref name = Perry/>

==Early life==
Goodkind was born in 1948,<ref name = encyclopedia>{{cite book |author=D'Ammassa D |title=Encyclopedia of fantasy and horror fiction |publisher=Facts on File |location=New York |year=2006 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=jUv5gVgSNvYC&pg=PA138#v=onepage&q&f=false 138–9] |isbn=0-8160-6192-0 }}</ref> and his home town was [[Omaha, Nebraska]].<ref name = Vegas>{{cite news | url = http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2000/Aug-01-Tue-2000/lifestyles/13986007.html | title = Author relies on memory to create fantasy tales | last = White | first = K | work = [[Las Vegas Review-Journal]] | date = 2000-08-01 | access-date = 2011-04-27}}</ref> Because he had [[dyslexia]], he found little interest in school, and therefore had no formal education beyond high school. In 1983, Goodkind moved with his wife, Jeri, to a house he built in Maine and later made his residence on the coast of [[Lake Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], his primary home.<ref name = Vegas/>

Goodkind's dyslexia initially dissuaded him from any interest in writing. Before starting his career as a writer, Goodkind built cabinets and violins, and was a marine and wildlife artist,<ref name = Vegas/> selling his paintings in galleries.<ref name = USAToday>{{cite news|url=http://cgi1.usatoday.com/mchat/20030805003/tscript.htm|title='Naked Empire': Author Terry Goodkind - Talk Today | newspaper= [[USA Today]] | date = April 8, 2003 | access-date = 2011-04-27 }}</ref> In 1993, during the construction of his and Jeri's home on the forested [[Mount Desert Island]], off the coast of [[Maine]], he began to write his first novel, ''[[Wizard's First Rule]]'', and his writing career was launched with its publication in 1994.<ref name = "Official Bio">{{cite web |url=http://www.prophets-inc.com/the_author/ |title=Terry Goodkind Bio |website= terrygoodkind.com}}</ref>

==Career==
Goodkind's first book, ''[[Wizard's First Rule]]'', was auctioned to a group of three publishers in 1994 and sold for a record price of $275,000.<ref name = Vegas/><ref name = Flewelling>{{cite news| url = http://www.sff.net/people/lynn.flewelling/s.goodkind.html | title = Lynn Flewelling interview with Terry Goodkind | work = Bangor Daily News | publisher =  SFF.net | date = November 1995 | access-date = 2011-04-27 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Gilmore | first = C | author-link = Chris Gilmore | title = The St. James Guide To Fantasy Writers | editor = Pringle D | publisher = [[Gale (publisher)|St. James Press]] | year = 1996 | isbn = 1-55862-205-5 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781558622050/page/237 237]–8 | editor-link = David Pringle | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781558622050 }}</ref> He subsequently published 16 other novels and one [[novella]].

Goodkind's 12 books in the ''[[The Sword of Truth|Sword of Truth]]'' series have sold 25 million copies and been translated into more than 20 languages.<ref name = MacMillan/>

Some of Goodkind's political views have provoked controversy,<ref name="gelder" /> notably the dedication to his novel ''The Pillars of Creation'' (2001):<ref>Gelder cites Goodkind's work as an example of the "reactionary aspects" of some modern fantasy writers. See Gelder (2004).</ref>

[[Don D'Ammassa]] described Goodkind as part of a "host of brand new writers [with] no previous experience writing fiction but who could turn out one large epic adventure after another".<ref>{{cite book|author=D'Ammassa D|title=Encyclopedia of fantasy and horror fiction|publisher=[[Infobase Publishing|Facts on File]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8160-6192-0|location=New York|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jUv5gVgSNvYC&pg=PA138#v=onepage&q&f=false 138–9]}}</ref> [[Robert Eaglestone]] described his books as a "depressing read" due to the series' overarching cynicism, with a weakness being the heroic characters are only likable in comparison with utterly murderous villains.<ref>{{cite book|author=Eaglestone R|title=Reading The Lord of the Rings: new writings on Tolkien's classic|publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group|Continuum]]|year=2005|isbn=0-8264-8460-3|location=London|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dmu9G8oU3oQC&pg=PA172#v=onepage&q&f=false 172]}}</ref>

==Genre and influences==
Goodkind perceived his novels to be more than just traditional fantasy because of their focus on philosophical and human themes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prophets-inc.com/the_author/va.html |title=Terry Goodkind - Interviews & Past Chats - VA Book Signing |date=September 9, 2000 |website=Prophets-Inc.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209010955/http://www.prophets-inc.com/the_author/va.html |archive-date=2008-02-09 |access-date=2009-08-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.terrygoodkind.com/chats/PIchat5.php |title=Prophets Inc Chat 5 |date=2003-09-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051217105437/http://terrygoodkind.com/chats/PIchat5.php |archive-date=2005-12-17 |website=terrygoodkind.com |access-date=2009-08-26}}</ref> Goodkind believed that using the fantasy genre allowed him to better tell his stories and better convey the human themes and emotions he desired to share with readers.<ref>{{cite web|last=Snider|first=JC|date=August 2003|title=Interview: Terry Goodkind|url=http://www.scifidimensions.com/Aug03/terrygoodkind.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040225065007/http://www.scifidimensions.com/Aug03/terrygoodkind.htm|archive-date=February 25, 2004|access-date=June 9, 2021|work=SciFiDimensions}}</ref>

On real world inspiration behind the characters of Richard and Kahlan, Goodkind had this to say "There were no such people. I created them both. I wanted them to be the kind of people I look up to."<ref>{{Cite web|title=ASK ME ANYTHING / FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS|url=https://www.terrygoodkind.com/faq|url-status=live|access-date=November 21, 2021|website=TERRY GOODKIND}}</ref>

Goodkind was influenced by the work of [[Ayn Rand]] and [[Objectivism|Objectivist]] philosophy. Writing about the series in [[The Atlas Society]] newsletter, Willam Perry states that Goodkind's "characters, plots, and themes...are clearly and directly influenced by Rand’s work, and the book’s heroes occasionally invoke Objectivist principles". Perry notes the Objectivist themes become most obvious in ''[[Faith of the Fallen]]'', which made the novel controversial among Goodkind's fan base; moreover, the novel contains several scenes that echo the plots of Rand's books ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' (1943) and ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'' (1957).<ref name="Perry">{{cite web|last=Perry|first=William|date=2006-05-17|title=The Randian Fantasies of Terry Goodkind|url=http://www.atlassociety.org/tni/randian-fantasies-terry-goodkind|url-status=live|access-date=2011-04-30|website=The Atlas Society}}</ref>

== Personal life and death ==
Goodkind competed in various forms of amateur and semi-professional auto racing, and drove a [[Radical Sportscars|Radical]] SR8 SM-500 race car for his own Rahl Racing team.{{Citation needed|date=June 2021}}
