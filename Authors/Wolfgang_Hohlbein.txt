==Personal life==
Wolfgang Hohlbein was born on 15 August 1953 in [[Weimar]], [[Bezirk Erfurt]]. When he finished school, he took an apprenticeship as industrial clerk. After the apprenticeship he worked in this profession in the following years. To bolster his income, he also worked as night watchman. It was during this time when he started to write his early works, to pass the time faster. In 1971 he met his wife [[Heike Hohlbein]], whom he would marry 3 years later. Together they raised six children. In 1977 their daughter [[Rebecca Hohlbein]] was born, who became a writer herself too. In 1982 he quit his job to work as a full-time author.

==Work==

Writing short stories since young age, Hohlbein was first recognized as an author after sending in a manuscript he and his wife had written at a fantasy and science fiction writing contest in 1982. They won and their book, ''Märchenmond'' (English title: "[[Magic Moon]]"), was published by ''[[Ueberreuter|Ueberreuter Verlag]]'', soon becoming a bestseller and winning several awards. In the following years the Hohlbein's wrote two sequels to the book, continuing their success. The trilogy remains their greatest success until today and sold more than 2 million copies.<ref name=Maerchenmondoff/><ref name=zeit/><ref name=faz/> He's also a writer of [[Pulp magazine|pulp fiction]], including the series ''Der Hexer'' (The Warlock), which he conceived in 1984 for the magazine ''Gespenster-Krimi'' (Ghost Thriller) published by [[Bastei Lübbe]], mainly based on [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s ''[[Cthulhu Mythos]]'', and of which he wrote the majority of novels initially under the collective [[pen name]] of Robert Craven. Later the series was reedited and republished as [[paperback]]s, which collected the stories of several pulp magazines, including a [[prequel]], and as [[e-book]]s both under Hohlbein's own name.<ref name=hohlbeinoffwerke/>

Hohlbein primarily writes in the genre of fantasy, horror and historical fiction. Since the success of ''Märchenmond'' Hohlbein had published more than 200 books. He sometimes cooperates with other authors like [[Dieter Winkler]] or his daughter Rebecca Hohlbein. His most important source of inspiration is his wife Heike Hohlbein, who is credited as co-author on more than 30 of his books. In his early days, Hohlbein also wrote a lot of paperback stories for various magazines and also often used a pseudonym. Later he focused more on stand-alone novels as well as some long-running book series, like the ''Enwor'' saga or the still not finished ''Chronik des Unsterblichen'' (''Chronicles of the Immortal'').<ref name=zeit/><ref name=spon/><ref name=hohlbeinoffwerke/><ref name=faz/>
