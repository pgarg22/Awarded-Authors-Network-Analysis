'''Sigurjón Birgir Sigurðsson''' (born 27 August 1962), known as '''Sjón''' ({{IPAc-en|ʃ|ɔː|n}} {{respell|SHAWN}}; both meaning "sight" and an abbreviation of his first name), is an Icelandic poet, novelist, and lyricist. Sjón frequently collaborates with the singer [[Björk]] and has performed with [[The Sugarcubes]] as '''Johnny Triumph'''. His works have been translated into 30 languages.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sjon.siberia.is/contact/ |title=Sjonorama |work=Web |access-date=28 February 2013}}</ref>

== Biography ==

Born in [[Reykjavík]], [[Iceland]], Sjón began his writing career early and published his first book of poetry, ''Sýnir'' (Visions), in 1978. He was one of the founding members of the neo-surrealist group Medúsa and became significant in Reykjavik's cultural scene.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.literature.is/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-3396/6134_read-108/ |title=literature.is - Höfundar |work=Web |publisher=Bjartur |access-date=28 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323122059/http://www.literature.is/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-3396/6134_read-108/# |archive-date=2012-03-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Active on the Icelandic music scene since the early 1980s, Sjón has collaborated with many of the best known artists of the era and was featured as guest vocalist on a rare [[The Sugarcubes|Sugarcubes]] 12" single "Luftgitar" in 1987 using the name Johnny Triumph; this was accompanied by a music video of Sjón playing [[air guitar]] with Björk and [[Einar Örn Benediktsson]]. Sjón would occasionally reprise this role for the final encore of The Sugarcubes concerts, including the band's one-off 2006 reunion show in Reykjavík.

Sjón was featured in the documentary ''[[Inside Björk]]''. In 2007, he contributed the original story and wrote the screenplay for the animated film ''[[Anna and the Moods]]''. He also joined the cast, voicing the character Dr. Artmann.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.annaandthemoods.com/ |title=Anna and the Moods |work=Web |publisher=CAOZ Ltd |access-date=28 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520105037/http://annaandthemoods.com/# |archive-date=2013-05-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
