'''Aleksander Wat''' was the pen name of '''Aleksander Chwat''' (1 May 1900 – 29 July 1967), a [[Poland|Polish]] poet, writer, art theoretician, memorist, and one of the precursors of the Polish [[futurism (art)|futurism]] movement in the early 1920s, considered to be one of the more important Polish writers of the mid 20th century.<ref name=Humanitas/> In 1959, he emigrated to [[France]] and in 1963 relocated to the United States, where he worked at the Center for Slavic and East European Studies of the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref name=Humanitas/>

==Life==
Aleksander Chwat was born on 1 May 1900 in [[Warsaw]], at that time under Russian rule, into a well-established and prosperous [[Jews|Jewish]] family. His father, Bronisław, was an observant Jew whose first language was [[Yiddish]].<ref name=Shore>{{cite book|author=Marci Shore|author-link=Marci Shore|year=2006|title=Caviar and Ashes: A Warsaw Generation's Life and Death in Marxism, 1918-1968|url=https://archive.org/details/caviarasheswarsa00shor|url-access=limited|publisher=Yale University Press|pages=[https://archive.org/details/caviarasheswarsa00shor/page/n34 12]–13|isbn=9780300110920|quote=... Yiddish, the only language his father spoke well.}}</ref> He allowed his children a liberal education. His family had interests in Polish literature and drama and one of his sisters, Seweryna Broniszówna (13 July 1891&nbsp;– 28 June 1982), was an actress.<ref name=memim/>
 
After a brief service with the [[Polish Army]] he graduated from the Faculty of Philology of the [[Warsaw University]], where he studied [[philosophy]], [[psychology]] and [[logic]].<ref name=Humanitas>{{cite web|url=http://www.humanitas.ro/humanitas/secolul-meu-confesiunile-unui-intelectual-european1|title=Secolul meu.

The following year he published his first collection of poems titled ''JA z jednej strony i Ja z drugiej strony mopsożelaznego piecyka'' (''Pug Iron Stove''; literally: ''I at Either Side of the Pug Iron Stove''),<ref name=PW96>{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-300-06406-3|title=Book review of ''Aleksander Wat: Life and Art of an Iconoclast''|author=Tomas Venclova|publisher=Publishers Weekly|date=1996|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref> which gained much popularity among the supporters of the new trends in literature of the epoch. In 1927 he followed up with a volume of short  stories, ''Lucifer unemployed'' (''Bezrobotny Lucyfer'' in Polish).<ref name=Humanitas/><ref name=PW96/> Until 1922 he was one of the creators of the influential monthly magazine ''Nowa Sztuka'' (''New Art''; appeared 1921-22), followed by ''Almanachy Nowej Sztuki'' (''New Art Almanach'') and "the increasingly rabid Communist periodical"<ref name=PW96/> ''Miesięcznik literacki'' (''The Literary Monthly''). He contributed in the dissemination of the work of [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]] and of [[Futurism]] in general across Poland, before becoming a supporter of [[communism]].<ref name=Humanitas/>

Until 1931 he was a main contributor to the [[Marxism|Marxist]] ''Tygodnik literacki'' (''Literary Weekly''). Between 1933 and the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939 he was also the literary director of ''Gebethner & Wolff'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://imslp.org/wiki/Gebethner_and_Wolff|title=Gebethner and Wolff|publisher=International Music Score Library Project|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref> the biggest and the most renowned Polish printing house of the time.<ref name=Humanitas/>

===War years===
After the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|Nazi invasion of Poland in 1939]] he moved to [[Lviv|Lwów]], then under [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] occupation.<ref name=Humanitas/> Despite his sympathy for Communism, he was arrested by the [[NKVD]] in 1940. He was held in detention successively at the former [[Zamarstyniv|Zamarstinov]] military prison in Lwów, then in [[Kiev]], at the NKVD's [[Lubyanka Building|Lubyanka prison]] in [[Moscow]], and finally at [[Saratov]].<ref name=Humanitas/>

Freed from prison in November 1941 under the terms of the general amnesty for Poles prompted by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion]] of the Soviet Union,<ref name=enotes>{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/my-century|title=''My Century'' Analysis|publisher=eNotes.com|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref> he was exiled to [[Kazakhstan]], with his wife Paulina, also known as Ola Watowa (26 April 1903 – 9 February 1991), and their 9-year-old son, Andrzej. During the war one of his brothers was killed at [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===In communist Poland===
In 1946, Wat was allowed to return to Poland during [[Polish population transfers (1944–46)]], along with most Polish nationals expelled from the [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union]]. He was appointed chief-editor of the [[Państwowy Instytut Wydawniczy|State Publishing Institute (PIW)]].<ref name=Humanitas/> However, he "turned away from Communism after his imprisonment by the Soviet secret police and became a vociferous spokesman for democracy."<ref>[http://yalepress.yale.edu/book.asp?isbn=0300064063 Wat profile] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222171955/http://yalepress.yale.edu/book.asp?isbn=0300064063 |date=December 22, 2015 }}, yalepress.yale.edu; accessed 2 August 2015.</ref> Considered unreliable by the Soviet-sponsored Communist authorities in Poland, he was removed from his position and not allowed to publish his own works. He devoted much of his time to translating of several classical pieces of English, French, German and Russian literature to Polish.<ref name=Humanitas/>

In 1953 Wat suffered a stroke, marking the beginning of an incurable psychosomatic condition, which from then on caused him acute physical pain and a state of oppressive anxiety.<ref name=encycl>{{cite web|url=http://agora.qc.ca/thematiques/mort/dossiers/wat_aleksander|title=Wat Aleksander profile|work=Encyclopédie sur la mort: La mort et la mort volontaire à travers les pays et les âges|publisher=Encyclopédie de l'Agora|date=12 April 2012|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>

In the wake of the [[Khrushchev Thaw|political thaw]] induced by [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s process of [[de-Stalinization|de-Stalinisation]], Wat returned to public life in 1957.<ref name=memim>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://memim.com/aleksander-wat.html|title=Aleksander Wat profile|encyclopedia=Memim Encyclopedia|publisher=memim.com|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>

===Emigration===
In 1959, he emigrated to [[France]] and settled in [[Paris]]. In 1963 he received an invitation to teach Slavic Literatures at the Center for Slavic and East European Studies of the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. From the beginning of 1964 until June 1965, Wat worked at Berkeley. There he recorded a series of discussions with [[Czesław Miłosz]] about his life, which he considered a kind of "spoken diary", published posthumously under the title "My Century".<ref name=Humanitas/>

Wat committed suicide on 29 July 1967 at his home in [[Antony, Hauts-de-Seine|Antony]], France.<ref name=Humanitas/> The disease of which he had suffered for fourteen years is usually quoted as the cause of his final act, but biographer [[Tomas Venclova]] sees the wave of [[Eastern Europe|East European]] [[anti-Semitism]] that followed the [[Six-Day War]] as the triggering cause.<ref name=Humanitas/><ref name=PW96/> During his youth Wat had long considered ending his life before reaching the age of twenty-five, which he saw as the last moment before the onset of inevitable mental ossification.<ref name=encycl/>

==World views==
Wat had a deeply conflicted religious identity: the son of a Jewish scholar, he developed an [[Atheism|atheistic]] worldview as a young boy due to his extensive reading, but converted to [[Catholicism]] during his time in Soviet prisons. His last wish was to be buried in a Christian cemetery in [[Israel]].<ref name=Shore/><ref name=memim/><ref name=PW96/><ref name=enotes/>
