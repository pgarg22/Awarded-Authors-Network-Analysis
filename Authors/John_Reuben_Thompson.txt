== Biography ==

John Reuben Thompson was born in [[Richmond, Virginia]], in 1823. He graduated in law from the [[University of Virginia]] in 1845.

Thompson did not pursue a career in the legal field, but instead dedicated himself to journalism and editorship. In 1847, he became the editor of the ''[[Southern Literary Messenger]]'' in Richmond, and in 1859 editor of ''[[The Southern Field and Fireside]]'' in Augusta, Georgia. Thompson did not take part in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] due to health reasons.  Instead, he went to [[London]], from where he supported the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] by writing articles in English magazines.

In 1866 he became editor of the ''[[New York Evening Post]]'', a position that he maintained until his death in New York in 1873.

Thompson was also a poet, most of his works being war-poems.

During his career and travels, Thompson had the chance to work closely with [[Edgar Allan Poe]], and many notable Southern authors, such as [[William Gilmore Simms]], [[Henry Timrod]], [[Paul Hamilton Hayne]] and [[Philip Pendleton Cooke]], as well as European authors.
