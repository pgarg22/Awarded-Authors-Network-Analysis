'''Annie Finch''' (born October 31, 1956) is an American poet, writer, editor, critic, translator, playwright, teacher, and performer.  Her [[poetry]] is known for its often incantatory use of rhythm, [[meter]], and [[poetic form]] and for its themes of [[witches]] and [[feminist spirituality]]. Her books include ''The Poetry Witch Little Book of Spells'', ''Spells: New and Selected Poems'', ''The Body of Poetry: Essays on Women, Form, and the Poetic Self'', ''A Poet’s Craft'', ''Calendars'', and ''Among the Goddesses.'' Her edited anthologies include ''A Formal Feeling Comes: Poems in Form by Contemporary Women'', ''Measure for Measure: An Anthology of Poetic Meters'', and ''Choice Words: Writers on Abortion'', the first major literary anthology about abortion.

==Early life and education==
Annie Finch was born in New Rochelle, New York, on October 31, 1956. Her mother was poet and doll artist Margaret Rockwell Finch <ref>Finch, Margaret Rockwell, ''Crone's Wines'', Ablemuse Press, 2017</ref><ref>Finch, Margaret Rockwell, National Institute of American Doll Artists Portfolio https://www.niada.org/portfolio/margaret-finch/</ref> and her father, [[Henry Leroy Finch, Jr.]], was a pacifist leader and a scholar of philosophy whose works include three books on [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].<ref>Finch, Henry Leroy, ''Wittgenstein: The Element Masters of Philosophy'', Element Books, 1995</ref><ref>Finch, Henry Leroy, Henry Leroy Finch Papers, Swarthmore College Peace Collection, Swarthmore College</ref>  Her great-aunt was the socialist organizer, politician, and writer [[Jessie Wallace Hughan]].<ref>Finch, Annie. "Desks." ''The Body of Poetry'', 106-110</ref> Finch began writing poetry as a child. She was educated in public schools, then for two years at Oakwood Friends School and one year at Simon's Rock Early College, where she studied filmmaking and art history.  At [[Yale University]] she studied poetry, anthropology, the history of the English language with [[Marie Borroff]], and Versification with Penelope Laurans, graduating [[magna cum laude]] in 1979. After traveling in Africa with painter Alix Bacon, in the early eighties she settled in New York's East Village, where she worked at [[Natural History Magazine]] and self-published and performed the rhythmical experimental longpoem''The Encyclopedia of Scotland.''  In 1984, Finch encountered the work of [[Ntozake Shange]] in a bookstore and "recognized in her a soul-mother, someone else for whom poetry was performative, sacred, curative, indispensable, physical."<ref>Finch, Annie Finch, "Stepping on the Edge of My Doubting,"''Thank You, Teacher: Grateful Students Tell the Stories of the Teachers Who Changed Their Lives'', New World Library, 2016, p. 250</ref> She immediately applied to the University of Houston, where Shange was teaching, and earned her M.A. in creative writing there in 1985 with a thesis in Verse Drama directed by Shange.<ref>Finch, Annie Finch, "Stepping on the Edge of My Doubting,"''Thank You, Teacher: Grateful Students Tell the Stories of the Teachers Who Changed Their Lives'', New World Library, 2016, p.&nbsp;252</ref> Finch earned a Ph.D in English and American Literature from [[Stanford University]] in 1990, studying [[feminist theory]] with [[Adrienne Rich]] and pursuing a self-designed concentration in Versification under the supervision of [[Diane Middlebrook]].

==Poetic career==
Finch's first poetry collection, ''Eve'' (Story Line Press, 1997), was a finalist for the [[National Poetry Series]] and the [[Yale Series of Younger Poets]].  ''Calendars'' ([[Tupelo Press]], 2003), finalist for the [[National Poetry Series]] and shortlisted for the Forward Poetry Book of the Year award, is structured around a series of poems written for performance to celebrate the [[Wheel of the Year]].<ref>Small Press Distribution Catalog. "Calendars,"</ref>  Her third book, ''Among the Goddesses: An Epic Libretto in Seven Dreams'' ([[Red Hen Press]], 2010), which received the Sarasvati Award for Poetry, is a hybrid work combining narrative and dramatic structure to tell a mythic story about abortion. ''The Encyclopedia of Scotland'' was published in 2010 by Salt Publishing in the U.K.;<ref name="auto">Finch, Annie. "Preface." ''The Encyclopedia of Scotland'', xi</ref> in the same year, Carnegie Mellon University Press reissued ''Eve'' in the Contemporary Classics Poetry Series. ''Spells: New and Selected Poems'' ([[Wesleyan University Press]], 2012), collects poems from each of Finch's previous books along with previously unpublished poems. ''The Poetry Witch Little Book of Spells'' (2019), also from Wesleyan University Press, offers small spells of fewer than eight lines, gathered by Finch from the longer poems of ''Spells.''

Finch's poems are collected in anthologies including the ''Academy of American Poets Poem-a-Day'', ''Penguin Book of The Sonnet'', ''Norton Anthology of World Poetry'', and ''Penguin Book of Twentieth-Century American Poetry''. Her poems for public occasions include a [[Phi Beta Kappa]] poem for Yale University and the memorial poem for the [[September 11 attacks]] installed in New York's [[Cathedral of St. John the Divine]] (accompanying the commemorative sculpture by [[Meredith Bergmann]]).<ref>Finch, Annie. "The Naming." "Poetry Witch Blog," Annie Finch's website</ref> She has written that she believes it is part of her calling as a poet to compose [[occasional poetry]] on topics of personal and cultural importance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2009/04/occasioning-poetry|title=Occasioning Poetry by Annie Finch|first=Poetry|last=Foundation|date=Oct 25, 2019|website=Poetry Foundation|access-date=Oct 26, 2019}}</ref>

==Critical reception==
Finch's dedication to writing in meter and her role as a scholar, editor, and critic of poetic form led some reviewers of her first books to classify her poetry within the movement known as [[New Formalism]]. ''[[Dictionary of Literary Biography]]'' named her "one of the central figures in contemporary American poetry" for her role in the reclamation of poetic form.<ref>Barron, Jonathan N. "Annie Finch." ''The Dictionary of Literary Biography'' 282, 101</ref> But reviewers soon noticed key differences between Finch's poetry and that of other new formalist poets. [[Henry S. Taylor|Henry Taylor]], for example, claimed that Finch was not a typical new formalist because she did not focus on the realities of contemporary life,<ref>Taylor, Henry, "Eve by Annie Finch",''Washington Times'' October 14, 1997</ref> and C.L. Rawlins emphasized the incantatory use of form in ''Eve'', writing, "Finch is a poet in her bones . . . . What she proves in ''Eve'' is that rhyme-and-meter isn't just a formerly fashionable sort of bondage, but a bioacoustic key to memory and emotion."<ref>Rawlins, C.L. "Review of Eve," ''Rain Taxi'', Fall 1998</ref>  Cindy Williams Gutierrez made a similar point in a review of a later book: “Finch is more shaman than formalist. She is keenly aware of the shape and sound of her poems. Whether in a chant, sonnet, ghazal, or even Billy Collins’ contrived paradelle, her skill is effortless: Form is merely the skin that allows her poems to breathe with ease.” <ref>Gutierrez, Cindy. "Calendars by Annie Finch" ''Calyx'', 2008, Vol. 24, No. 2</ref>

Poet and critic [[Ron Silliman]] has situated Finch in the context of [[experimental poetry]], writing, "Annie Finch can't be a new formalist, precisely because she's passionate both about the new and about form. She is also one of the great risk-takers in contemporary poetry, right up there with [[Lee Ann Brown]] & [[Bernadette Mayer]] in her willingness to completely shatter our expectations as readers."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ronsilliman.blogspot.com/2005/08/annie-finch-cant-be-new-formalist.html|title=Silliman's Blog|access-date=Oct 26, 2019}}</ref>  The experimental aspect of Finch's work became more evident with the publication of ''Spells,'' which includes 35 of the poems composed in the 1980s that she refers to as the "lost poems." In the preface to ''Spells'', she describes these as "metrical and experimental poems [that]. . . did not find their audience until the avant-garde's rediscovery of formal poetic strategies just a few years ago."<ref>Finch, Annie. "Preface." ''Spells: New and Selected Poems'', iv</ref>

Reviewing ''Calendars'', poet and Goddess scholar [[Patricia Monaghan]] was one of the first critics to articulate the intersection of formal poetics and spirituality in Finch's work, writing, "Annie Finch is a traditionalist. Not in the way the word is commonly used . . . but in a strange experimental way.  An oracle, an ecstatic maenad: that is the kind of traditional poet Annie Finch is." 
<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webdelsol.com/WDSRB/Monaghan.html|title=Web Del Sol Review of Books|website=www.webdelsol.com|access-date=Oct 26, 2019}}</ref>

Finch's literary archive was purchased by the [[Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library]] at Yale University in 2016.

==Feminism and spirituality==
In the preface to ''Spells: New and Selected Poems'' (2013), Finch writes, "Compiling this book has led me to appreciate how much I was inspired as a poet by coming of age during the feminist movement of the 1970s. Reading it has helped me understand the ways I struggled over the years to throw off the burden of misogyny on my spiritual, psychological, intellectual, political, and poetic identities. My themes are often female-centered . . . I am proud to define myself as a woman poet."<ref>Finch, Annie. Spells:New and Selected Poems (Wesleyan University Press, 2013). pp. xi-xii</ref>

Finch's feminism is also evident in her prose writing, editing, and literary organizing. Her first anthology ''A Formal Feeling Comes: Poems in Form by Contemporary Women'' (1993) collected poems and essays by contemporary women poets. The "metrical code," the central theory of her book of literary criticism ''The Ghost of Meter'' (1994), is cited in the article on "feminist poetics" by [[Elaine Showalter]] in the ''Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics.'' <ref>Showalter, Elaine. "Feminist Poetics." In Alex Preminger et al, eds. Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics (Princeton U. Press, 1993) p. 406</ref><ref>Finch, A.R.C.. "Dickinson and Patriarchal Meter: A Theory of Metrical Codes." PMLA Volume 102, Number 2, March 1987, pp. 166–176</ref><ref>Finch, Annie. The Ghost of Meter: Culture and Prosody in American Free Verse (University of Michigan Press, 1994, pp. 13-30</ref>  Her essay collection ''The Body of Poetry: Essays on Women, Form, and the Poetic Self'' (2005) includes writings on women poets including [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]], [[Carolyn Kizer]], [[Maxine Kumin]], [[Audre Lorde]], [[Lydia Sigourney]], [[Sara Teasdale]], and [[Phillis Wheatley]], many based in feminist theory. In 1997, Finch founded the international listserv Discussion of Women Poets ([[Wom-Po]]).  She facilitated the listserv until 2004 when she passed ownership of the list to [[Amy King]].

In October 2016, anticipating the [[#MeToo]] movement, Finch became one of the first victims of sexual assault in the literary world to name writers, editors, and teachers who had sexually assaulted her during her career.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://anniefinch.com/some-things-ive-been-ashamed-to-share-about-being-a-woman-writer-until-now/|title=Literary Sexual Abuse: Things I've Been Ashamed to Share About Being a Writer Until Now|date=Oct 17, 2016|access-date=Oct 26, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191026004349/https://anniefinch.com/some-things-ive-been-ashamed-to-share-about-being-a-woman-writer-until-now/|archive-date=October 26, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://scroll.in/article/879348/before-indias-metoo-a-poetry-anthology-replaced-its-editor-after-allegations-of-sexual-misconduct|title=Before India's #MeToo, a poetry anthology replaced its editor after allegations of sexual misconduct|first=Urvashi|last=Bahuguna|website=Scroll.in|access-date=Oct 26, 2019}}</ref>

In 2019 Finch launched a [[Kickstarter]] campaign to raise funds for the publication of ''Choice Words: Writers on Abortion'', which the publisher, [[Haymarket Books]], calls "the first major literary anthology about abortion."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://anniefinch.com/choicewords/|title=Choice Words: Writers on Abortion|date=Apr 8, 2019|access-date=Oct 26, 2019}}</ref> The Kickstarter launched two days before Alabama passed an [[abortion ban]] and reached its fundraising goal in the first week.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kirch |first=Claire |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/80156-kickstarter-campaign-for-book-on-abortion-surpasses-goal.html |title=Kickstarter Campaign for Book on Abortion Surpasses Goal |publisher=Publishersweekly.com |date=2019-05-24 |access-date=2019-10-26}}</ref> Choice Words was published in April 2020.

Claire Keyes notes in ''Scribner's American Writers'', "A strong current in [Finch's] work is the decentering of the self, a theme which stems from her deep connection with the natural world and her perception of the self as part of nature."<ref>Keyes, Claire. "Annie Finch." ''Scribners American Writers Series'' 2009, 00</ref>  In an interview Finch stated, "Some of my poems are lyric, some narrative, some dramatic, and some meditative, but all are concerned with the mystery of the embodied sacred.".<ref>Finch, Annie. "An Interview with Annie Finch." ''Poemeleon http://www.poemeleon.org/an-interview-with-annie-finch/''{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}''</ref> Finch writes in the preface of her 2013 collection ''Spells: New and Selected Poems'' that she considers her poems and verse plays to be "spells" whose rhythm and form invite readers "to experience words not just in the mind but in the body."<ref>Finch, Annie. "Preface." ''Spells: New and Selected Poems'', xi</ref>

Finch started a blog called American Witch in 2010 <ref>{{cite web|url=https://anniefinch.com/what-kind-of-witch-are-you/|title=Are You a Good Witch or a Bad Witch? (FAQ)|date=Dec 19, 2017|access-date=Oct 26, 2019}}</ref> and has published several articles about earth-centered spirituality in [[The Huffington Post]].

==Verse plays, libretto, and musical settings==
Finch's dramatic works of poetry include ''The Encyclopedia of Scotland'' (1983), originally performed in a libretto version with live music, as well as ''Among the Goddesses: An Epic Libretto in Seven Dreams'' (Red Hen Press, 2010) and ''Wolf Song,'' which premiered at Portland, Maine's [[Mayo Street Arts]] in 2012.  Both plays were collaborative productions incorporating music, dance, puppets, and masks. Finch has also written and performed several works in a genre she calls "poetry ritual theater," combining multimedia poetry performance with interactive audience ritual; these including "Five Directions," premiered at Mayo Street Arts, Portland, Maine, in 2012, directed by Alzenira Quezada, and "Winter Solstice Dreams," premiered at Deepak Homebase, New York, in 2018,  directed by Vera Beren.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://anniefinch.com/poetry-witch-ritual-theater|title=Ritual Theater|date=Apr 7, 2019|access-date=Oct 26, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDeG4I0W_9E|title=WOLFSONG ~ Live from the Mayo Street Arts center in Portland, Maine|access-date=Oct 26, 2019|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref>

Composers who have set Finch's poems to music include Stefania de Kennessey, Matthew Harris, and Dale Trumbore. Trumbore's settings of the poems have won the Yale Glee Club Emerging Composers Award, the Gregg Smith Choral Composition Contest, and other awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0y-zQMrRtD4|title=All We Need (SATB Choir) - Text by Annie Finch, Music by Dale Trumbore|access-date=Oct 26, 2019|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.daletrumbore.com/lullaby|title=Dale Trumbore &#124; Butterfly Lullaby|website=Dale Trumbore|access-date=Oct 26, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.halleonard.com/product/35030827/all-we-need|title=All We Need|website=Hal Leonard Online|access-date=Oct 26, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoKF9Fo4aZk|title=Landing Under Water (Stefania de Kenessey, Annie Finch)|access-date=Oct 26, 2019|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref> Finch was invited by composer [[Deborah Drattell]] to write the libretto for the opera ''Marina'', based on the life of poet Marina Tsvetaeva. it was produced by [[American Opera Projects]] in 2003, directed by [[Anne Bogart]], and sung by [[Lauren Flanigan]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/06/arts/in-performance-classical-music-an-operatic-treatment-of-a-russian-poet-s-despair.html|title=IN PERFORMANCE: CLASSICAL MUSIC; An Operatic Treatment Of a Russian Poet's Despair|first=Allan|last=Kozinn|date=May 6, 2003|access-date=Oct 26, 2019|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>

== Prosody and literary criticism ==
Finch's 1993 book ''The Ghost of Meter: Culture and Prosody in American Free Verse'' uses prosody and postmodern and feminist theory to explore the semiotics of meter in free verse poetry by [[Walt Whitman]], [[Emily Dickinson]], [[Stephen Crane]], [[T.S. Eliot]], [[Audre Lorde]], and other poets. Building on the work of [[Roland Barthes]] and on [[John Hollander]]'s theory of "the metrical frame," Finch calls her theory of metrical meanings "the metrical code."<ref>Finch, Annie. ''The Ghost of Meter''(University of Michigan Press, 1993</ref> The essay collection ''The Body of Poetry'' explores further topics in feminist poetics and poetic form including translation, "Metrical Diversity," and readings of poets including [[Sara Teasdale]], [[Phillis Wheatley]], [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]], [[Marilyn Hacker]], and [[John Peck (poet)|John Peck]].<ref name="auto1">Finch, Annie. "Metrical Diversity." ''The Body of Poetry'', 84-92</ref> Finch's edited or coedited anthologies of poetry and poetics include ''A Formal Feeling Comes: Poems in Form by Contemporary Women'', ''An Exaltation of Forms: Contemporary Poets on the Diversity of Their Art'', ''Villanelles'', and ''Measure for Measure: An Anthology of Poetic Meters''. She has also authored a poetry-writing textbook, ''A Poet's Craft: A Comprehensive Guide to Making and Sharing Your Poetry.'' <ref>Brock, J. "Review of ''An Exaltation of Forms'', ''Choice'', September 2002</ref><ref>Palmer, G.M. "Why We Read: Spells by Annie Finch'', ''The Critical Flame'', September 2013''</ref>

At a time when [[Emily Dickinson]] was the only nineteenth-century woman poet receiving critical attention, Finch's 1987 article "The Sentimental Poetess in the World: Metaphor and Subjectivity in [[Lydia Sigourney]]'s Nature Poetry" approached Sigourney through postmodern theories of the poetic self.<ref>"The Sentimental Poetess in the World: Metaphor and Subjectivity in [[Lydia Sigourney]]'s Nature Poetry, ''Legacy'' Vol. 5, No. 2 (Fall 1988), pp. 3-18</ref> A subsequent essay on Sigourney was commissioned for ''Lydia Sigourney: Critical Essays and Cultural Views'' (2018), which also included Finch's elegiac poem for Sigourney.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.umass.edu/umpress/title/lydia-sigourney|title=Lydia Sigourney &#124; University of Massachusetts Press|website=www.umass.edu|access-date=Oct 26, 2019}}</ref>  In the essay collection ''The Body of Poetry: Essays on Women, Form, and the Poetic Self,'' Finch discusses her ideas about "poetess's poetics" in broader terms <ref>Finch, Annie. "Poetess Poetics." ''The Body of Poetry'', 100-110</ref>

== Translation ==
Finch's translation from French of the poetry of [[Louise Labé]] was published by [[University of Chicago Press]], honored by the Society for the Study of Early Modern Women, and represented in the ''Norton Anthology of World Literature''. ''Spells'' includes translations from [[Anglo-Saxon]], [[Classical Greek]], and Russian. In the preface to ''Spells'' and in The Body of Poetry, Finch explains that the physical qualities of the original poem, including [[meter]] and [[rhyme]], are central to her translation process.

== Teaching==
Finch began teaching as a graduate assistant, first at the University of Houston and then at [[Stanford University]], where she TA'ed for [[Adrienne Rich]]'s "Introduction to Poetry" and developed an original course, "Women, Language, and Literature." She has served on the creative writing and literature faculties of universities including New College of California, University of Northern Iowa, Miami University (Ohio), and the University of Southern Maine, where she served as Director of the [[Stonecoast MFA Program in Creative Writing|Stonecoast MFA Program]] from 2004 to 2012. She has taught at conferences and literary centers including Wesleyan Writers Conference, Poetry by the Sea conference, West Chester Poetry Conference, Ruskin Arts Center, and Poets House; online at Yale Alumni Workshops, 24 Pearl St. and the London Poetry School. She has been a guest lecturer at universities including [[University of Notre Dame]], [[Indiana University]], "University of California at Berkeley", "University of Toronto", and [[Harvard University]]. Since 2020, she has taught courses in [[poetic meter and form]] online through Poetry Witch Community.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.poetrywitch.com}}</ref>
