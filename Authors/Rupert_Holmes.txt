'''David Goldstein''' (born February 24, 1947), better known as '''Rupert Holmes''', is a British-American composer, singer-songwriter, musician, dramatist and author. He is widely known for the hit singles "[[Escape (The Piña Colada Song)]]" (1979) and "[[Him (Rupert Holmes song)|Him]]" (1980). He is also known for his musicals ''[[The Mystery of Edwin Drood (musical)|The Mystery of Edwin Drood]]'', which earned him two [[Tony Awards]], and ''[[Curtains (musical)|Curtains]]'', and for his television series ''[[Remember WENN]]''.

==Life and career==
Holmes was born David Goldstein in [[Northwich]], Cheshire, England. His father, Leonard Eliot Goldstein, was a [[United States Army]] [[Warrant Officer (United States)|warrant officer]] and bandleader. His mother, Gwendolen Mary (''née'' Pynn),<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/64/Rupert-Holmes.html "Rupert Holmes Biography (1947–)"], FilmReference.com, accessed June 7, 2013</ref> was English, and both were musical. Holmes has dual British and American citizenship. The family moved when Holmes was six years old to the northern New York City suburb of [[Nanuet, New York]], where Holmes grew up and attended nearby [[Nyack, New York|Nyack High School]] and then the [[Manhattan School of Music]] (majoring in clarinet). Holmes's brother, Richard, is the principal lyric [[baritone]] of the [[New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players]], sings roles with regional opera companies, such as [[Glimmerglass Opera|Glimmerglass]], [[Lake George Opera|Lake George]] and [[Virginia Opera]], and has appeared with the [[Metropolitan Opera]].<ref>[https://www.operamusica.com/artist/richard-holmes/# "Richard Holmes: Baritone"], OperaMusica.com; and Heath, Mary Jo. [http://www.metopera.org/Discover/Articles/Backstage-Spotlights/richard-holmes " Backstage Spotlight: Richard Holmes"], MetOpera.org, November 1, 2016</ref>

In 1969, Holmes married childhood friend Elizabeth "Liza" Wood Dreifuss, an attorney. Their daughter Wendy died suddenly in 1986, at the age of ten, of an undiagnosed [[brain tumor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=2897|title=You Got It All by The Jets|work=Songfacts|access-date=September 10, 2018}}</ref> They have two sons, Nick, a filmmaker, and Timothy, who is [[autism|autistic]]. In 2009, they moved from [[Scarsdale, New York|Scarsdale]], New York, where they had lived since Wendy's death, to [[Cold Spring, New York|Cold Spring]], New York.<ref name=Yarnell2019>Yarnell, Laurie. [https://hvmag.com/life-style/rupert-holmes-escape-pina-colada-song-cold-spring "The Man Who Wrote ‘'The Piña Colada Song' Lives Locally in Cold Spring"], ''[[Hudson Valley (magazine)|Hudson Valley]]'', July 12, 2019</ref>

===Songwriter and recording artist===
In his 20s, Holmes was a session musician (producing sessions, writing and arranging songs, singing and playing a few instruments). In 1969, Holmes and [[Ron Dante]] ([[the Cuff Links]], [[the Archies]]) recorded "Jennifer Tomkins" for release on their second album, ''The Cuff Links''.  During the recording of that album, Dante was prohibited by the studio that produced the Archies from any involvement in new recording ventures and was forced to drop out of ''The Cuff Links''.  Holmes finished the project and released "Jennifer Tomkins" separately under a different studio name, Street People (not related to the [[The Street People|mid-1970s band of the same name]]).<ref>[http://video.aol.com/video-detail/jennifer-tomkins-the-street-people/2913485933/?icid=VIDURVMUS12 Jennifer Tomkins", The Street People], video.aol.com</ref> The song was on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for 15 weeks, beginning January 3, 1970, reaching a peak of 36.  A follow-up single called "Thank You Girl" reached 96 on the Billboard pop charts in April 1970.

Holmes played the piano for both the Cuff Links and [[The Buoys (American band)|the Buoys]],<ref name=Allmusic1>Summers, Kim. [https://www.allmusic.com/artist/rupert-holmes-p18292/biography Rupert Holmes: Biography]. AllMusic, accessed April 6, 2011</ref> with whom he had his first international hit, "[[Timothy (song)|Timothy]]", which was on the Hot 100 for 17 weeks beginning on January 2, 1971, a No. 17 song about [[cannibalism]] that intentionally drew controversy.<ref>[http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=2005 Timothy] at Songfacts, accessed January 12, 2009</ref> He also wrote "Give Up Your Guns" (which peaked at No. 84), "The Prince of Thieves", "Blood Knot", and "Tomorrow" for the band.  Holmes also wrote jingles and pop tunes (including for [[Gene Pitney]], [[the Platters]], [[the Drifters]], [[Wayne Newton]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Barry Manilow]] and television's [[the Partridge Family]]),<ref name=Allmusic1/><ref>Minnick, Susan L. [http://www.us.imdb.com/name/nm0392035/bio Rupert Homes biography] at the IMDB website</ref> as well as the score of the 1970 revenge [[Western (genre)|western]], ''Five Savage Men'' (also known as ''The Animals''), which starred [[Keenan Wynn]].<ref>[http://www.rupertholmes.com/film/five_savage.html ''Five Savage Men''], RupertHolmes.com, accessed May 16, 2015</ref>

As a recording artist, Holmes broke through with his first album, 1974's [[Widescreen (album)|''Widescreen'']] on [[Epic Records]],<ref name=Allmusic1/> which introduced him as a presenter of highly romantic, lushly orchestrated "story songs" that told a witty narrative punctuated by clever rhymes and a hint of comedy. [[Barbra Streisand]] discovered this album and asked to record songs from it, launching Holmes on a successful career. She then used some of his songs in the movie ''[[A Star Is Born (1976 film)|A Star Is Born]]''. Holmes also arranged, conducted, and wrote songs on her 1975 album ''[[Lazy Afternoon (Barbra Streisand album)|Lazy Afternoon]]'' as well as five other Streisand albums.<ref>[http://totaltheater.com/index.php?id=75&idcat=&ncat=periodica&option=com_totaltheater&task=view Feature on ''Curtains''] at the Total Theatre website</ref> Holmes's second, self-titled album led ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' to compare him with [[Bob Dylan]] in the sense of being an artist of unprecedented originality that commanded attention.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Holmes's production skills were also in demand during this period, and he took on this role for [[Lynsey de Paul]] on her album ''Tigers and Fireflies'', which spawned the radio hit "Hollywood Romance". The album also featured the bluesy song "'Twas", co-written by Holmes and de Paul.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Lynsey-De-Paul-Tigers-And-Fireflies/release/3653267|title=Lynsey De Paul – Tigers And Fireflies|website=Discogs}}</ref> He additionally produced [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]]' 1976 LP, ''[[Big Beat (album)|Big Beat]]'', though the album was not a success. In 1975, together with Jeffrey Lesser, Holmes produced the UK band [[Sailor (band)|Sailor]]'s album ''Trouble'' (CBS Epic).<ref>McCarraher, James. ''A Glass of Champagne, The Official Sailor Story'', Sarum Press (2004)</ref><ref>[http://www.sailor-music.com/album75.htm ''Trouble''], Sailor Club, accessed December 29, 2012</ref>

"[[Escape (The Piña Colada Song)]]" was included on Holmes's fifth album, ''[[Partners in Crime (album)|Partners in Crime]]'', and was the final [[List of Hot 100 number-one singles of 1979 (U.S.)|Hot 100 No. 1 of 1979]].  Another popular song on that album was "[[Him (Rupert Holmes song)|Him]]", which peaked at number 6 on the Hot 100.  He had another top-40 hit with "Answering Machine".  In 1986, Holmes's composition "[[You Got It All (The Jets song)|You Got It All]]" (sometimes called "You Got It All Over Him") was a top 3 hit single for [[The Jets (Minnesota band)|The Jets]] and was later recorded by pop superstar [[Britney Spears]] and featured in her internationally released version of ''[[Oops!... I Did It Again (album)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]'' (2000). He also produced two songs for singer [[Judy Collins]] that appeared on her album ''Sanity and Grace''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} His song "The People That You Never Get to Love" was featured on four albums by [[Susannah McCorkle]] ''The People That You Never Get to Love'' (1981), ''From Bessie to Brazil'' (1993), ''Most Requested Songs'' (2001), and ''Ballad Essentials'' (2002). [[Frank Sinatra, Jr.]] also recorded the tune on his ''That Face!'' album (2006).

In the 1980s and 1990s, Holmes also played in cabarets and comedy clubs, mostly in New York City, telling often autobiographical anecdotes illustrated with his songs.<ref>Holden, Stephen. [https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/03/arts/review-cabaret-rupert-holmes-onstage.html "Review/Cabaret; Rupert Holmes Onstage"], ''The New York Times'', August 3, 1990, p. 17</ref> In a 2016 episode of the TV show ''[[Better Call Saul]]'', Jimmy says that he is making a documentary about Holmes and sings part of "Escape".<ref>Potts, Kimberly.

===Playwright===
Holmes made his professional debut as a playwright with the [[Musical theater|musical]] ''[[The Mystery of Edwin Drood (musical)|The Mystery of Edwin Drood]]'' in 1985. He was encouraged to write a musical by [[Joseph Papp]] and his wife after they attended one of Holmes's cabarets in 1983. The result, loosely based on the [[Charles Dickens]] [[The Mystery of Edwin Drood|unfinished novel of the same name]], and inspired by Holmes's memories of English [[pantomime]] shows he attended as a child, was a hit in New York's Central Park and on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].  Because Dickens left the novel unfinished at his death, Holmes employed the unusual device of providing alternate endings for each character who is suspected of the murder, and letting the audience vote on a different murderer each night. The show earned Holmes the [[Tony Award]] for both book and score, as well as the [[Drama Desk Award]]s for [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Lyrics|lyrics]], [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Music|music]], the [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Book of a Musical|book]] and [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Orchestrations|orchestrations]], among various other honors. The musical has been given London and Broadway revivals, among others. The success of ''Drood'' would lead Holmes to write other plays (both musical and non-) in later years, though he has stated that he avoided musical theater for some time after the death of his daughter.

Holmes also wrote the Tony Award-nominated ("Best Play 2003") ''[[Say Goodnight, Gracie]]'', based on the relationship between [[George Burns]] and [[Gracie Allen]]. The play, which starred [[Frank Gorshin]], was that Broadway season's longest running play and the third longest-running solo-performance show in Broadway history.<ref>Gioia, Michael.

Holmes has written a number of other shows, including ''Solitary Confinement'', which played on Broadway at the [[Nederlander Theatre]] in 1992<ref>Gussow, Mel.

''Curtains'' played at the [[Al Hirschfeld Theatre]] on Broadway, and [[David Hyde Pierce]] and [[Debra Monk]] starred in the lead roles. Holmes and Peter Stone (posthumously) won the 2007 [[Drama Desk Award]] for Outstanding Book of a Musical for ''Curtains''.

Holmes wrote the book of the musical ''[[First Wives Club (Musical)|The First Wives' Club]]'', adapted from the film [[The First Wives Club|of the same name]].
