'''Ida Jenbach''' was an Austrian [[playwright]] and [[screenwriter]] for German and Austrian [[film|cinema]] during the 1920s. She was one of the authors of the spirited farce ''Opera Ball'' that appeared at the [[Little Carnegie Playhouse]] in [[New York City]] in 1931. ''[[New York Times]]'' critic [[Mordaunt Hall]] praised this comedy as “cleverly acted by the principals.”  ''[[The Opera Ball (1931 film)|The Opera Ball]]'' (''Opernredoute'') was a German film that had “captions in English lettered on the scenes to keep those unfamiliar with German au courant of what is happening.”<ref>{{cite book|title=Between Two Worlds: The Jewish Presence in German and Austrian Film, 1910-1933|author=Siegbert Salomon Prawer|publisher=Berghahn Books|year= 2005|isbn=1-84545-074-4}}</ref>

In 1926, Jenbach wrote the script to ''[[The Priest from Kirchfeld (1926 film)|The Priest from Kirchfeld]]'', based on [[Ludwig Anzengruber]]‘s popular German "folk play". The play bears a notable resemblance to ''The Atonement of Gosta Berling.'' Attacking the [[Catholic]] doctrine of [[celibacy]] for priests and the denial of burial for [[suicide]]s, the play was and remains very controversial.

Jenbach also worked on the screenplay to [[Hugo Bettauer]]’s 1924 [[dystopia]]n [[satire]], ''[[Die Stadt ohne Juden]]'' ("The City without Jews").  This novel was prescient. It imagined a city that expelled the Jews and confiscated their wealth. It was meant to show the ridiculousness of [[anti-Semitism]]. It was Bettauer’s most famous and best selling novel, and was translated into numerous languages. It was also his undoing. The novel angered the [[Nazi]]s. A year later, Nazi party member [[Otto Rothstock]] murdered Bettauer. When the film version opened, members of the National Socialist party tossed [[stink bomb]]s into the cinemas, and cinema owners often cut parts of the film out. This film was the first important role for German film star [[Hans Moser (actor)|Hans Moser]]. In 1933, some in the German press said that this film speaks for itself as an indictment against [[Hitler]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}.

During the [[Third Reich]], Jenbach was sent to the [[Minsk Ghetto]]. She died either there or in a concentration camp nearby. Her date of death is unknown.
