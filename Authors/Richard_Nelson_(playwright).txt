==Personal life==
Nelson was born in Chicago, Illinois to Viola, a dancer, and Richard Finis Nelson, an accounting-systems analyst and some times sales representative.<ref name=FilmReference>{{cite web|title=Richard Nelson Biography (1950-)|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/36/Richard-Nelson.html|access-date=25 April 2013|publisher=FilmReference.com}}</ref> During Nelson's childhood, the family moved frequently to accommodate his father's work, but they settled for long stretches in Gary, Indiana, the outskirts of Philadelphia, and finally in a suburb of Detroit. Nelson's earliest theatrical influences were in musical theatre, and he estimates that he saw more than twenty-five musicals before ever seeing his first straight play.<ref name=DiGaetani>{{cite book|title=A Search for a Postmodern Theater: Interviews with Contemporary Playwrights|year=1991|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=New York|isbn=0313273642|pages=[https://archive.org/details/searchforpostmod0000diga/page/237 237–44]|editor=John L. DiGaetani|url=https://archive.org/details/searchforpostmod0000diga/page/237}}</ref>

He graduated from [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] in 1972, and received an honorary Doctor of Literature degree from Hamilton College in 2004.<ref>[http://uticaphoenix.net/tony-award-winning-playwright-richard-nelson-lecture-hamilton-college/ "Tony Award-Winning Playwright Richard Nelson to Lecture at Hamilton College"] February 21, 2004</ref>

He married Cynthia Blair Bacon on May 21, 1972; they have two children, Zoe (b. 1983) and Jocelyn (b. 1988).<ref name=FilmReference/>

==Career==
He has worked with the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]], and had ten plays produced there. Those plays include: ''Principia Scriptoriae'' (1986), ''Some Americans Abroad'' (1989), ''Two Shakespearean Actors'' (1990),<ref>[http://www.calmview.eu/shakespearebirthplacetrust/CalmView/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Performance&id=TWS199009&pos=1 "'Two Shakespearean Actors' Listing"] shakespearebirthplacetrust, accessed March 4, 2016</ref> ''Columbus and the Discovery of Japan'' (1992), ''Misha's Party'' (1993),<ref>[http://theatricalia.com/play/wc/mishas-party/production/2q8 "'Misha's Party' Listing"] theatricalia.com, accessed March 4, 2016</ref> ''New England'' (1994),<ref>Herman, Jan.

in November 2006, ''Frank's Home'', about two days in the life of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], premiered in Chicago, Nelson's home town, at the [[Goodman Theatre]] (in association with Playwrights Horizons).<ref>[http://www.goodmantheatre.org/season/0607/franks-home/ ''Frank's Home''] goodmantheatre.org, accessed April 13, 2016</ref> In an interview in ''[[The Brooklyn Rail]]'' at the time of its New York debut, Nelson offers advice to young writers: "My advice is always to write, to write what really matters. I ask my students two questions: Why did you write it? And should I watch it? People ask about structure, form, character development, and I’m not even sure what all of that means. Try not to second guess yourself. Form will come if you focus on what you want to say with truth and honesty. Structure is the hand that holds up what you want to say."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pippa|first=Cristina|title=Wrighting Home with Richard Nelson|journal=The Brooklyn Rail|date=February 2007|url=http://brooklynrail.org/2007/02/theater/wrighting-home}}</ref> From 2005 to 2008, Nelson was the chair of the playwriting department at the [[Yale School of Drama]].<ref name=Hernandez>{{cite news|last=Hernandez|first=Ernio|title=Richard Nelson Appointed New Playwriting Department Chair at Yale School of Drama|access-date=25 April 2013|newspaper=Playbill.com|date=4 March 2005|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/91566-Richard-Nelson-Appointed-New-Playwriting-Department-Chair-at-Yale-School-of-Drama}}</ref>

==The Apple Family plays==
From 2010 to 2013, Nelson wrote and directed four plays centered around the Apple Family, a fictional household set in [[Rhinebeck, New York]] with each play focused on either an election or a significant historical anniversary. The main characters are three adult sisters, Barbara, Marian and Jane — called a "Chekhovian family pod" by the ''Variety'' reviewer.<ref name=variety>Stasio, Marilyn. [https://variety.com/2011/legit/reviews/sweet-and-sad-1117946085/ "Review: ‘Sweet and Sad’"] ''Variety'', September 14, 2011</ref>

The first play in the series, ''That Hopey Changey Thing'', focused on the [[2010 midterm elections]] and opened on election night, November 2, 2010.<ref>Sommer, Elyse. [http://www.curtainup.com/hopeychangey.html "A CurtainUp Review.

Each play debuted off-Broadway at [[The Public Theater]], featuring essentially the same cast members in each subsequent production.<ref>{{cite news|last=Healy|first=Patrick|title=Hudson Valley Town Is A Playwright's Home and Template|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/07/theater/richard-nelsons-rhinebeck-ny-stars-in-apple-plays.html?ref=theater|access-date=9 November 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=6 November 2013}}</ref> With the opening of ''Regular Singing'' in 2013, the Public Theater presented the entire series in repertory.<ref>Hetrick, Adam.

The cast of ''That Hopey Changey Thing'', ''Sweet and Sad'', and ''Sorry'' featured Jon DeVries as Benjamin Apple, [[Maryann Plunkett]] as Barbara Apple, [[Jay O. Sanders]] as Richard Apple, [[Shuler Hensley]] as Tim Andrews, [[Laila Robins]] as Marian Apple Platt and [[J.

On April 29, 2020, the Public live-streamed a new Apple Family play, ''What Do We Need to Talk About?''. Again directed by Nelson, it reunited the cast from ''Regular Singing''. The characters, now seven years older, meet by video during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].

==''The Gabriels''==
Nelson has written a new trilogy, titled ''The Gabriels: Election Year in the Life of One Family'', focusing on the Gabriel family during the 2016 presidential election year. The same cast appears in all three plays: Meg Gibson (Karin Gabriel), Lynn Hawley (Hannah Gabriel), Roberta Maxwell (Patricia Gabriel), [[Maryann Plunkett]] (Mary Gabriel), [[Jay O. Sanders]] (George Gabriel), and Amy Warren (Joyce Gabriel). The first play, ''Hungry'', opened off-Broadway at the Public Theatre on February 27, 2016 (previews), and officially on March 4, directed by Nelson.<ref>Rickwald, Bethany.

''Hungry'' is set in [[Dutchess County]], New York. The family of the recently deceased Thomas Gabriel are in the kitchen to prepare dinner. The group includes Thomas's widow, Mary; his sister, Joyce; his brother George and his wife Hannah; his elderly mother Patricia; and his first wife Karin. For dinner, the group peels apples for [[apple crisp]] and makes [[ratatouille]] and pasta. Referring to the political campaign, one character says: "God, it's going to be a long eight months."<ref>Scheck, Frank.

Patricia has taken a roommate at her retirement community, and her debts are the focus of the play. The family prepares for a picnic as they deal with their "fears of the post-recession world."<ref name=gordon/> In ''Women of a Certain Age'', set between 5 pm and 7 pm on election night, the Gabriels have gathered for dinner. George has picked up their son from college to vote and has driven him back. Joyce is at home and Patricia has also joined the group. The play ends without revealing the winner of the election.<ref name=women>[http://www.lortel.org/Archives/Production/6288 ''Women of a Certain Age''] lortel.org, accessed November 9, 2016</ref><ref>Paulson, Michael.
