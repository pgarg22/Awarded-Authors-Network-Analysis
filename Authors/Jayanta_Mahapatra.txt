==Indian Poets Trio==
Mahapatra was part of a trio of poets who laid the foundations of Indian English poetry. He shared a special bond with [[A. K. Ramanujan]]. Mahapatra is also different in not being a product of the Bombay school of poets besides [[R. Parthasarathy]]. Over time, he has managed to carve a quiet, tranquil poetic voice of his own, different from those of his contemporaries.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.museindia.com/regularcontent.asp?issid=51&id=4461 |title=Archived copy |access-date=6 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107013948/http://www.museindia.com/regularcontent.asp?issid=51&id=4461 |archive-date=7 November 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
