'''Feliks Wiktor Kres''' (a pseudonym of '''Witold Chmielecki'''; born 1966 in [[Łódź]]) is a popular [[Poland|Polish]] [[fantasy]] writer. He debuted with his short story "Mag" (''Mage''), submitted to a writing contest of the ''[[Fantastyka]]'' magazine. Since then, he has published seven novels and dozens of short stories. His pseudonym may be translated as Lucky (or Happy) End ("Felix" in Latin means lucky and "kres" means the end in Polish).

He is best known for his two fantasy cycles - ''Księga całości'' (''The Book of Entirety''), which takes place in a world called [[Szerer]], where intelligence, in addition to humans, was given also to [[cat]]s and [[vulture]]s, and ''Piekło i szpada'' (''Hell and épée''), dark fantasy set in an alternative 17th century, with demons and beings older than [[Satan]] himself. His works have been translated into [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

For several years he has been running a guide for young writers in the magazines ''[[Fenix (magazine)|Fenix]]'', ''[[Magia i Miecz]]'', and currently in ''[[Science Fiction (Polish magazine)|Science Fiction]]''.
