==Life==
[[File:Sir Henry Rowley Bishop by Isaac Pocock.jpg|thumb|Portrait by Pocock of [[Henry Bishop (composer)|Henry Bishop]]]]
Isaac Pocock was born in [[Bristol]] on 2 March 1782, the eldest son of [[Nicholas Pocock]], marine painter, and Ann Evans (daughter of John Evans of Bristol). William Innes Pocock (1783–1836), a naval officer and author, was his brother. About 1798, Isaac became a pupil of [[George Romney (painter)|George Romney]], with Thomas Alphonso Hayley, son of the writer [[William Hayley]], as a fellow student. After Romney's death in 1802, he studied under [[Sir William Beechey]].<ref name="dnb46">DNB, 1885–1900, vol. 46, p. 3.</ref>

Between 1800 and 1805 Pocock exhibited subject-pictures and portraits at the [[Royal Academy]], [[London]], and occasionally showed portraits there over the next 15 years. In 1807 his ''Murder of St. Thomas à Becket'' was awarded a prize of £100 by the [[British Institution]]. In 1812 Pocock became a member of the [[Liverpool Academy of Arts|Liverpool Academy]], and exhibited oils and water-colours there. His last historical painting was an altar-piece for a new chapel at [[Maidenhead]].<ref name="dnb46" />

In 1818 Pocock inherited some property at [[Maidenhead]] after the death of his mariner uncle, Sir Isaac Pocock (1751–1810), and thereafter devoted himself to writing dramas. For some time he lived in [[London]] and served in the Royal Westminster Volunteers, rising to the rank of [[Major]]. Later he became a [[Justice of the Peace]] (JP) and [[Deputy Lieutenant]] (DL) for [[Berkshire]], and was an active [[magistrate]].<ref name="dnb46" />

Pocock died at Ray Lodge, Maidenhead, on 23 August 1835, and was buried in the family vault at [[Cookham]].<ref name="dnb46" />

==Dramatic works==
Pocock's first dramatic work was a musical farce in two acts, entitled ''Yes or No?'',<ref>I. Pocock. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=4aFAAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22Isaac+Pocock%22&source=bl&ots=PcuLeEOS4D&sig=-d4pNubZ5Ox-G_GGPKsFZYYIxgw&hl=en&ei=3BrlTM2HB9CbhQeiu-S2DA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CDsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q&f=false Yes or No?]'' (J. Barker, 1809).</ref> produced at the [[Haymarket Theatre]], in London on 31 August 1808, and performed ten times. It received mixed reviews.

It was followed by many similar productions,<ref name="dnb46" /> of which ''Hit or Miss!'',<ref>I. Pocock. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=rBkOAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22Isaac+Pocock%22&hl=en&ei=JCHlTPGPAcOnhAf-wsTdDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false Hit or Miss!]'' (W. H. Wyatt, 1810).</ref> with music by [[Charles Smith (singer)|Charles Smith]], was by far the most successful, opening at the Lyceum on 26 February 1810, and performed at least 33 times. Its success, it was said, was owed to the performance of [[Charles Mathews]] in the character "Dick Cypher". In 1815 Mathews appeared also in Pocock's ''Mr. Farce-Writer'' at the [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden Theatre]].

''Twenty Years Ago'', a melodramatic entertainment, was performed at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] in 1810. ''Anything New'', with overture and music by Charles Smith, was given on 1 July 1811, but the ''Green-eyed Monster'', produced on 14 October with [[William Dowton]], [[William Oxberry]], and Miss Mellon in the cast, was harshly reviewed. Nevertheless, it was revived at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]] in 1828, when [[William Farren]] and [[Ellen Tree]] played in it. The music was composed by [[Thomas Welsh (composer)|Thomas Welsh]]. Shown the next season was a [[burletta]] by Pocock called "''Harry Le Roy''".

Pocock's ''Miller and his Men'', a popular romantic melodrama with music by [[Henry Bishop (composer)|Henry Bishop]], was still playing in 1835. ''For England Ho!'', a melodramatic opera, produced at Covent Garden on 15 December 1813, and acted some 11 times, was published in 1814. ''John of Paris'', a comic opera adapted from the French, was produced at Covent Garden on 12 October 1814, and performed 17 times.<ref>I. Pocock. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=rBkOAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22Isaac+Pocock%22&hl=en&ei=JCHlTPGPAcOnhAf-wsTdDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false John of Paris]'' (John Miller, 1814).</ref> Liston played an innkeeper. When revived at the Haymarket in 1826, [[Lucia Elizabeth Vestris]] was in the cast. It was again played at Covent Garden in 1835. ''Zembuca, or the Net-maker'', first given at Covent Garden, as "a holiday piece" on 27 March 1815, was played 28 times. The ''Magpie or the Maid'' (John Miller, 1815),</ref> a drama in three acts, a second edition of which appeared in 1816, was adapted from the French of [[Louis-Charles Caigniez]] and [[Théodore Baudouin d'Aubigny]].<ref>I. Pocock.

"''Robinson Crusoe, or the Bold Buccaneers''", a romantic drama in two acts, was produced as an Easter piece at Covent Garden in 1817, with [[Charles Farley]] in the title rôle and [[Joseph Grimaldi]] as Friday. It was published, with remarks by [[George Daniel (writer)|George Daniel]], and printed in Lacy's and Dick's ''Collections''. It was revived in 1826.
[[File:Theatre Royal Jersey 31 Janvier 1829.jpg|thumb|''Rob Roy Macgregor, or Auld Lang Syne'' was performed at the Theatre Royal, [[Jersey]], on 31 January 1829]]
Pocock later adapted some of the [[Waverley novels]] as operatic dramas. On 12 March 1818 his ''Rob Roy Macgregor, or Auld Lang Syne'', an operatic drama in three acts, was first played at Covent Garden.<ref>I. Pocock. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PCAOAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22Isaac+Pocock%22&hl=en&ei=JCHlTPGPAcOnhAf-wsTdDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CD8Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q&f=false Rob Roy Macgregor; or, Auld lang syne! ]'' (John Miller, 1818).</ref> [[William Charles Macready]] took the title role, [[John Liston]] played Baillie Nicol Jarvie, and Miss Stephens Di Vernon. It was acted 34 times. It was played at [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], for Farren's benefit, on 15 April 1815, when [[James Prescott Warde]] was successful as Rob Roy. In the revival of the following year Farren took Liston's place as the Baillie. This play and Pocock's ''John of Paris'' were given together at Bath on the occasion of Warde's farewell to the stage, on 5 June 1820. [[James William Wallack]] played in ''Rob Roy'' at Drury Lane in January 1826; and Madame Vestris impersonated Di Vernon at the Haymarket in October 1824. The play was published in 1818. ''Montrose, or the Children of the Mist'', three acts, produced at Covent Garden on 14 February 1822, was not so successful, though it was played 19 or 20 times. Liston appeared as Dugald Dalgetty. "''Woodstock''", five acts, first acted on 20 May 1826, was a comparative failure, though the cast included [[Charles Kemble]] and Farren. ''Peveril of the Peak'', three acts, produced on 21 October of the same year, was acted nine times. ''The Antiquary'' was also unsuccessful. ''Home, Sweet Home, or the Ranz des Vaches'', a musical entertainment with the music by Henry Bishop, was produced at Covent Garden on 19 March 1829, with Madame Vestris and Keeley in the cast.<ref>I. Pocock. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ml8GBO6fZLkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22Isaac+Pocock%22&hl=en&ei=JCHlTPGPAcOnhAf-wsTdDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CDoQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q&f=false Home Sweet Home]'' (S. R. Kirkby, 1824).</ref>

Besides these plays, Pocock wrote ''The Heir of Veroni'' and ''The Libertine'', operas, in 1817, ''Husbands and Wives'', a farce in 1817, ''The Robber's Wife'', a romantic drama in two acts, adapted from the German in 1829 with music by F.
