'''Jan Brzechwa''' ({{IPA-pol|ˈbʐɛxfa}}), (15 August 1898 – 2 July 1966) was a [[Polish poet]], author and lawyer, known mostly for his contribution to children's literature. He was born '''Jan Wiktor Lesman''' to a [[Polish Jew|Polish family of Jewish descent]].<ref name="YIVO">[https://books.google.com/books?id=OL9tAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Jan+Brzechwa%22&dq=%22Jan+Brzechwa%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ag_qTtWxJdTaggenu6D9CA&ved=0CEcQ6AEwBA Brzechwa, Jan (1898–1966)] ''The YIVO encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe'', Volume 1. ''[[Yale University Press]]'', 2008. {{ISBN|0-300-11903-8}}.</ref>

== Early life ==

Brzechwa was born in [[Żmerynka]], [[Podolia]].  His father was a [[railway engineer]] and Jan spent a lot of his childhood travelling around Eastern Poland ("[[Kresy]]") with his family. Brzechwa studied at a Jesuit high school, [[Zakład Naukowo-Wychowawczy Ojców Jezuitów w Chyrowie]] (Scientific and Educational Department of the Jesuit Fathers in [[Chyrów]]), and upon moving from [[Podolia]] to [[Warsaw]], he graduated from the School of Law at the [[Warsaw University]]. During the [[Polish-Soviet War]], he volunteered for the 36th Regiment of the [[Academic Infantry Legion]], a formation composed of university students and was decorated for his service. His formal writing debut took place in 1920 by way of various [[humor magazine]]s. He worked as a lawyer and attorney for the [[Polish Society of Authors and Composers]] (ZAIKS) where he specialized and excelled in [[copyright law]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://culture.pl/pl/tworca/jan-brzechwa|title = Jan Brzechwa &#124; Życie i twórczość &#124; Artysta}}</ref>

Brzechwa was a cousin of another famous Polish poet, [[Bolesław Leśmian]]. He was married three times; first to Maria Sunderland, his first cousin once removed<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://culture.pl/pl/tworca/jan-brzechwa|title = Jan Brzechwa &#124; Życie i twórczość &#124; Artysta}}</ref> and a niece of the renowned Polish artist Celina Sunderland,<ref>[[:pl:Celina Sunderland]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=February 2018}} then to Karolina Lentowa (née Meyer), and finally to Janina Magajewska (1915–1989). His daughter from his first marriage, Krystyna (born 1928), is a painter.

==Literary output==

''Jan Brzechwa'' was the writer's pseudonym. The name Brzechwa translates into '[[fletching]]' (the tail section of an arrow). His poetry was written mostly in the melodic style of the 8-syllable accentual verse, the most popular rhythmic structure among the Polish stylistic variations.<ref name="K-A-P">Reinhard Köhler, Gabriel Altmann, Raĭmond Genrikhovich Piotrovskiĭ, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ODC4ZTwn81wC&pg=PA744&dq=%22Jan+Brzechwa%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=lhLqTqWQK8fgggeF0aCICQ&ved=0CFUQuwUwBTgK#v=onepage&q=%22Jan%20Brzechwa%22&f=false  ''Quantitative linguistics''.] Walter de Gruyter, 2005. {{ISBN|3-11-015578-8}}.</ref>

In 1926 he published ''Oblicza zmyślone'' ("Imaginary visages"), his first book of poems. His first set of poems for children ''Tańcowała igła z nitką'' ("Danced the needle with the thread") was published in 1937. Among his most popular works is ''[[Chrzaszcz|Chrząszcz]]'' (''The Beetle''), a poem proverbial for the hardest-to-pronounce phrase in [[Polish literature]],{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} even for adult native [[Polish language|Polish]] speakers. Its first line ''"W Szczebrzeszynie chrząszcz brzmi w trzcinie"'' (''In the town of [[Szczebrzeszyn]] a beetle buzzes in the reeds'') is the best known Polish [[tongue-twister]], in which almost all of the consonants make distinct buzzing sounds. Brzechwa is also popular in Poland for having written a number of lyrical children's poems. He was a translator of [[Russian literature]], translating works by [[Aleksandr Pushkin]], [[Sergey Yesienin]] and [[Vladimir Mayakovskiy]].

Brzechwa also wrote a long-running series of children's books based on the adventures of [[Pan Kleks]], the headmaster of a magical academy, and his students. Many of the Kleks books and plot points were made into a series of films in the 1980s, while the poem ''Pchła Szachrajka'' (''[[Adventures of a Cheating Flea]]'') was developed into an animated film in 1989.

Many of Brzechwa's texts have been translated into English by [[Walter Whipple]], but as of 2004 they have yet to be published. Brzechwa died in Warsaw in 1966 and is buried at the [[Powązki Cemetery]], the most famous cemetery in the city.
