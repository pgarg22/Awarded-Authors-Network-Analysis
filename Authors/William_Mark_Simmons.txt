'''Wm. (William) Mark Simmons''', born 1953 in [[Independence, Missouri]], is an American writer best known for his humorous [[fantasy]] and [[horror fiction|horror]] novels.

Simmons has worked as a journalist, educator, entertainer, and broadcaster, spending more than 30 years in the latter category working in classical music formats for [[National Public Radio]] affiliates.

Although he garnered awards as a journalist in his twenties, he did not turn his talents to long-form fiction until his late thirties, publishing his first novel in 1990. A [[Compton Crook Award]] finalist, he made [[Locus Magazine]]'s "Best Lists" in 1991.

A member of the [[Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America]] (SFWA), Simmons presently lives in [[Hutchinson, Kansas]] where he is the Music Director and Classical Morning host for the [[Radio Kansas]] network.

In 2010 Simmons was the Interfilk guest musician at FilkOntario 20, a yearly [[Filk music]] conference and convention in [[Ontario]], Canada.
