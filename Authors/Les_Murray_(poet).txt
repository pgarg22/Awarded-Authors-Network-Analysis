'''Leslie Allan Murray''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|size=100%|AO}} (17 October 1938 – 29 April 2019) was an Australian [[poet]], [[anthologist]], and [[critic]]. His career spanned over 40 years and he published nearly 30 volumes of poetry as well as two [[verse novel]]s and collections of his prose writings. 

Translations of Murray's poetry have been published in 11 languages: French, German, Italian, Catalan, Spanish, Norwegian, Danish, Swedish, Hindi, Russian, and Dutch.<ref name="LB">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lesmurray.org/|title=Review of the book by William Shakespeare "Macbeth"|website=Easy To Read: Book Reviews|accessdate=23 November 2021}}</ref> Murray's poetry won many awards and he is regarded as "the leading Australian poet of his generation".<ref name="JT77">{{Cite web|url=http://johntranter.com/reviewer/1977-murray.shtml|title=Redirection page, jt.com to jt.net|website=johntranter.com}}</ref><ref name="Coetzee2011">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/sep/29/angry-genius-les-murray/ | title=The Angry Genius of Les Murray | magazine=[[The New York Review of Books]] | date=29 September 2011  | access-date=13 September 2011 | author=Coetzee J.

==Life and career==
Les Murray was born in [[Nabiac, New South Wales|Nabiac]], New South Wales and grew up in nearby Bunyah. He attended primary and early high school in Nabiac and then [[Taree High School]]. At age 18, while watching [[Mayfly|mayflies]] along the river, Murray decided to become a poet.<ref name="economist">[https://www.economist.com/obituary/2019/05/09/obituary-les-murray-died-on-april-29th "Obituary: Les Murray died on April 29th,"] ''[[The Economist]]'', 9 May 2019.</ref> 

In 1957 Murray entered the [[University of Sydney]] in the Faculty of Arts and joined the [[Royal Australian Navy Reserve]] to obtain a small income. Speaking about this time to [[Clive James]] he has said: <blockquote>"I was as soft-headed as you could imagine. I was actually hanging on to childhood because I hadn't had much teenage. My Mum died and my father collapsed. I had to look after him. So I was off the chain at last, I was in Sydney and I didn't quite know how to do adulthood or teenage. I was being coltish and foolish and childlike. I received the least distinguished degree Sydney ever issued. I don't think anyone's ever matched it."<ref>Speaking to Clive James on stage at the [[Royal Festival Hall]], [[London]], during 'Poetry International', 6–14 October 2000</ref> </blockquote>In 1961 ''[[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin]]'' published one of Murray's poems.<ref name="economist" /> He developed an interest in ancient and modern languages, and eventually qualified to become a professional translator at the [[Australian National University]] (where he was employed from 1963 to 1967). During his studies he met other poets and writers such as [[Geoffrey Lehmann]], Bob Ellis,<ref name="LB"/><ref name="OCAL">Wilde W., Hooton J., Andrews, B (1994). ''The Oxford Companion of Australian Literature'' 2nd ed. [[South Melbourne, Victoria|South Melbourne]], ''[[Oxford University Press]]''</ref> [[Clive James]] and [[Lex Banning]] as well as future political journalists [[Laurie Oakes]] and [[Mungo Wentworth MacCallum|Mungo McCallum Jr]]. Between times, he [[hitch-hike]]d around Australia.  Murray lived for several months at a [[Sydney Push]] household at [[Milsons Point, New South Wales|Milsons Point]],<ref name="PA">Alexander, Peter F. ''Les Murray: a Life in Progress''. Oxford University Press UK, 2000</ref>{{rp|97–99}} where he read [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Eclogues]]'' at the suggestion of his host, Brian Jenkins.<ref name="PA" />{{rp|120}} 

Murray returned to undergraduate studies in the 1960s.  He converted to Roman Catholicism when he married [[Budapest]]-born fellow-student Valerie Morelli in 1962. His poetry frequently refers to Catholic themes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=McInerney |first1=Stephen  |date=202o |title=Les Murray's sacramental poetics |url=https://australiancatholichistoricalsociety.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/McInerney-achs-journal-26-02-2020-1.pdf |journal=Journal of the Australian Catholic Historical Society |volume=41 |issue= |pages=158–172 |doi= |access-date=24 Apr 2021}}</ref> The couple lived in Wales and Scotland and travelled in Europe for over a year in the late 1960s. They had five children together.

In 1971, Murray resigned from his "respectable cover occupations" of translator and [[public servant]] in [[Canberra]] (1970) to write poetry full-time.<ref name="LB"/> The family returned to Sydney, but Murray, planning to return to his home at Bunyah, managed to buy back part of the lost family home in 1975 and to visit there intermittently until 1985 when he and his family returned to live there permanently.<ref name="OCAL"/>

Murray died on 29 April 2019 at a [[Taree, New South Wales]], nursing home at the age of 80.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-04-29/les-murray-australian-poet-dies-aged-80/11055966|title=Australian poet Les Murray dies at 80|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=29 April 2019|access-date=29 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/australian-poet-les-murray-dies-aged-80-20190429-p51icd.html|title=Les Murray, Australian poet, dies aged 80|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=29 April 2019|access-date=29 April 2019}}</ref>

==Literary career==
Murray had a long career in poetry and [[literary journalism]] in Australia. When he was 38 years old, his ''Selected Poems'' was published by [[Angus & Robertson]], signifying his emergence as a leading poet.<ref name="JT77"/>  The Murray biographer Peter Alexander has written that "all Murray’s volumes are uneven, though as Bruce Clunies Ross would remark, 'There's "less good" and "good", but it's very hard to find really inferior Murray'."<ref name=PAE>Alexander, Peter F. [http://www.lesmurray.org/lifeinprogress2.htm  "Forgiving the Victim, 1996–1998" (excerpt from ''Les Murray: A Life In Progress''], pp 276–286)]</ref>

When Murray was a student at the University of Sydney he was the editor of ''[[Hermes (publication)|Hermes]],'' with [[Geoffrey Lehmann]] (1962)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digital.library.sydney.edu.au/nodes/view/6805|title=Hermes 1962|publisher=University of Sydney Library|access-date=2019-04-30}}</ref>''.'' Murray edited the magazine ''Poetry Australia'' (1973–79).<ref name="OCAL"/> During his tenure as poetry editor for Angus & Robertson (1976–90) he was responsible for publishing the first book of poetry by [[Philip Hodgins]]. In 1991 Murray became literary editor of ''[[Quadrant (magazine)|Quadrant]]''. He edited several anthologies, including the ''Anthology of Australian Religious Poetry''. First published in 1986, a second edition was published in 1991. It interprets religion loosely<ref name="OCAL"/> and includes the work of many of poets, such [[A. D. Hope]], Judith Wright, [[Rosemary Dobson]], Kevin Hart, [[Bruce Dawe]], and himself. The ''[[New Oxford Book of Australian Verse]]'' was most recently re-issued in 1996.

Murray described himself, perhaps half-jokingly, as the last of the "[[Jindyworobak Movement|Jindyworobaks]]", an Australian literary movement whose white members sought to promote [[Indigenous Australian cultures|indigenous Australian ideas and customs]], particularly in poetry.<ref name="LB"/> Though not a member, he was influenced by their work, something that is frequently discussed by Murray critics and scholars in relation to his themes and sensibilities.

In 2007, [[Dan Chiasson]] wrote in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' that Murray was "now routinely mentioned among the three or four leading English-language poets".<ref>[[https://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2007/06/11/070611crbo_books_chiasson?printable=true Fire Down Below] Chaissen, Dan (2007) "Fire Down Below: The Poetry of Les Murray", ''The New Yorker]', 11 June 2007]</ref> Murray was talked of as a possible winner of the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/books/2007/10/nobel_prize_for_literature.html|title=Blogposts |website=The Guardian}}</ref>

Murray retired as literary editor of ''Quadrant'' in late 2018 for health reasons.<ref>"Clive James tribute on Les Murray's retirement", ''[[Quadrant (magazine)|Quadrant]]'', December 2018, p. 3.</ref>

==Poetry==
Murray published around 30 volumes of poetry and is often called Australia's bush-[[bard]]. The academic [[David McCooey]] described Murray in 2002 as "a traditional poet whose work is radically original".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/books/les-is-more-20020318-gdu252.html|title=Les is more|date=18 March 2002|website=The Age}}</ref> His poetry is rich and diverse, while also exhibiting "an obvious unity and wholeness" based on "his consistent commitment to the ideals and values of what he sees as the real Australia".<ref name="OCAL"/> 

While admiring Murray's linguistic skill and poetic achievement, poet [[John Tranter]], in 1977, also expressed uneasiness about some aspects of his work. Tranter praises Murray's "good humour" and concludes that "For all my disagreements, and many of them are profound, I found the ''Vernacular Republic'' full of rich and complex poetry."<ref name="JT77"/>

Bourke writes that:<blockquote>Murray's strength is the dramatization of general ideas and the description of animals, machines, or landscape. At times his immense self-confidence produces [[garrulity]] and sweeping, dismissive prescriptions. The most attractive poems show enormous powers of invention, lively play with language, and command of rhythm and idiom. In these poems Murray invariably explores social questions through a celebration of common objects from the natural world, as in "The Broad Bean Sermon", or machines, as in "Machine Portraits with Pendant Spaceman". Always concerned with a "common reader", Murray's later poetry (for example, ''Dog Fox Field, 1990, Translations from the Natural World'', 1992) recovers "populist" conventions of newspaper verse, singsong rhyme, and [[doggerel]].<ref name="LB"/></blockquote>

American reviewer [[Albert Mobilio]] writes in his review of ''Learning Human: Selected Poems'' that Murray revived the traditional [[ballad form]]. He goes on to comment on Murray's conservatism and his humour: <blockquote>"Because his conservatism is imbued with an angular, self-mocking wit, which very nearly belies the down-home values being expressed, he catches readers up in the joke. We end up delighted by his dexterity, if a bit doubtful about the end to which it's been put."<ref name="AM">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/12/books/down-home-down-under.html|title=Down Home Down Under|first=Albert|last=Mobilio|date=12 March 2000|work=The New York Times}}</ref></blockquote>In 2003, Australian poet [[Peter Porter (poet)|Peter Porter]], reviewing Murray's ''New Collected Poems'', makes a somewhat similar paradoxical assessment of Murray:<blockquote>"A skewer of [[polemic]] runs through his work. His brilliant manipulation of language, his ability to turn words into installations of reality, is often forced to hang on an embarrassing moral sharpness. The parts we love – the Donne-like baroque – live side by side with sentiments we don't: his increasingly automatic opposition to liberalism and intellectuality."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/mar/15/featuresreviews.guardianreview13|title=Review: New Collected Poems by Les Murray|first=Peter|last=Porter|date=15 March 2003|work=The Guardian}}</ref></blockquote>

==Themes and subjects==
Twelve years after Murray's induced birth, his mother miscarried another child.  She died after the doctor failed to call an ambulance. Literary critic Lawrence Bourke writes that "Murray, linking his birth to her death, traces his poetic vocation from these traumatic events, seeing in them the relegation of the rural poor by urban élites. Dispossession, relegation, and independence become major preoccupations of his poetry".<ref name="LB"/> Beyond this, though, his poetry is generally seen to have a nationalistic bent. ''The Oxford Companion to Australian Literature'' writes that: <blockquote>The continuing themes of much of his poetry are those inherent in that traditional nationalistic identity – respect, even reverence, for the pioneers; the importance of the land and its shaping influence on the Australian character, down-to-earth, [[wikt:laconic|laconic]] ... and based on such Bush-bred qualities as [[egalitarianism]], practicality, straight-forwardness and independence; special respect for that Australian character in action in wartime ... and a brook-no-argument preference for the rural life over the sterile and corrupting urban environment.<ref name="OCAL"/></blockquote> Of his literary journalism, Bourke writes that "In a lively, frequently polemic prose style he promotes republicanism, patronage, Gaelic bardic poetry, warrior virtu, mysticism, and Aboriginal models, and attacks modernism and feminism."<ref name="LB"/>

==Controversies==
In 1972, Murray and some other Sydney activists launched the [[Australian Commonwealth Party]],<ref name=PA/>{{rp|144–145}} and authored its unusually idealistic campaign manifesto. During the 1970s he opposed the New Poetry or "literary modernism" which emerged in Australia at that time, and was a major contributor to what is known in Australian poetry circles as "the poetry wars". "One of his complaints against post-modernism was that it removed poetry from widespread, popular readership, leaving it the domain of a small intellectual clique".<ref name="OCAL"/> As American reviewer [[Albert Mobilio]] describes it, Murray "waged a campaign for accessibility".<ref name="AM"/>

In 1995, Murray became involved in the Demidenko/Darville affair.  [[Helen Darville]], an Australian writer who had won several major literary awards for her novel ''The Hand That Signed the Paper,'' had claimed to be  the daughter of a Ukrainian immigrant.  However, it was revealed that was instead the English migrants. Murray said of Darville that <blockquote>"She was a young girl, and her book mightn't have been the best in the world, but it was pretty damn good for a girl of her age [20 when she wrote it]. And her marketing strategy of pretending to be a Ukrainian might have been unwise, but it sure did expose the pretensions of the multicultural industry". </blockquote>Biographer Alexander writes that in his poem "A Deployment of Fashion", Murray linked "the attack on Darville with the wider phenomenon of attacks on those judged outcasts (from [[Lindy Chamberlain]] to [[Pauline Hanson]]) by society’s fashion police, the journalists, academics and others who form opinion (p.282).<ref name="PAE" /> 

In 1996, Murray became involved in a controversy about whether Australian historian [[Manning Clark]] had received and regularly worn the medal of the [[Order of Lenin]] (p 276).<ref name="PAE" />

==Adaptations==
In 2005, ''The Widower'', a short film based on five poems by Murray, was released. It was directed by Kevin Lucas and written by singer-festival director, [[Lyndon Terracini]], with music by [[Elena Kats-Chernin]]. Its cast included [[Chris Haywood]] and [[Frances Rings]]. The five poems used for the film are "Evening Alone at Bunyah",  "Noonday Axeman", "The Widower in the Country", "Cowyard Gates" and "The Last Hellos". ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' reviewer Paul Byrnes concludes his review with:
<blockquote>The film is stunningly beautiful at times, and wildly ambitious, an attempt to be both wordless and wordy, to get to the hypnotic state that poetry and music can induce while saying something meaningful about black and white attitudes to land and love. This last part, as I read Murray, is largely imposed and disruptive, trying to pin a romantic political agenda to the work that's hardly there. It makes the film too literal, too current, when it wants to lodge itself in the more mysterious part of the brain. The film still has a power – Haywood's performance is magnificent – but it never achieves a strong inner reality. It falls short of its own tall ambitions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/the-widower-20050630-gdllne.html|title=The Widower|date=30 June 2005|website=The Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref></blockquote>
