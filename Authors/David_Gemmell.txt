'''David Andrew Gemmell''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|ɛ|m|əl}}; 1 August 1948&nbsp;– 28 July 2006) was a British author of [[heroic fantasy]], best known for his [[debut novel]], ''[[Legend (Gemmell novel)|Legend]]''. A former journalist and newspaper editor, Gemmell had his first work of fiction published in 1984. He went on to write over thirty novels. Gemmell's works display violence, yet also explore themes of honour, loyalty and redemption. There is always a strong heroic theme but nearly always the heroes are flawed in some way. With over one million copies sold, his work continues to sell worldwide.

The [[David Gemmell Awards for Fantasy]] were awarded from 2009 to 2018, with a stated goal to "restore fantasy to its proper place in the literary pantheon". A steering group of 18 authors was chaired by writer [[Stan Nicholls]] and the award was decided by a public vote.

| style="text-align: left;" |"Some of the other children had no father, but their lack was honorable. [Their] Dad died in the war, you know. He was a hero. This boy's lack was the subject of sly whispers from the adults, and open jeering from his peers. This boy's mother was—the boy heard so many times —a whore… the word was less hurtful than the blows that would follow it. Most of the blows came from other children, but sometimes adults too would weigh in."

David Gemmell was born in 1948 in west [[London]]. Raised alone by his mother until the age of 6, he experienced a harsh upbringing in a tough urban area, suffering bullying and taunts from his peers, partly due to the absence of his father,<ref name="transworld">{{cite web | url=http://www.booksattransworld.co.uk/davidgemmell/home.htm | title=David Gemmell at Transworld | publisher=[[Transworld (Company)|Transworld Publishers]] | access-date=26 November 2007 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215135421/http://www.booksattransworld.co.uk/davidgemmell/home.htm | archive-date=15 December 2007 }}</ref> and often sustained serious injuries through fighting. Preferring reading books to fighting, he was compelled to take up [[boxing]] by his stepfather, who insisted he learn how to stand up for himself without "hiding behind walls or running away"; this philosophy informed much of Gemmell's later writing.<ref name="nicholls"/> As a child, he said he "would have given anything" to stand beside [[Harold Godwinson|King Harold II]] at the [[Battle of Hastings]]. As a teenager, he wanted to stand with Marshal Will Kane in the film ''[[High Noon]]''.<ref name="sff">{{cite news | url=http://www.sffworld.com/interview/23p0.html | title=Interview with David Gemmell | publisher=Science Fiction and Fantasy News | date=1 August 1998 | access-date=6 February 2008}}</ref>

Gemmell was expelled from school at the age of 16, for organizing a [[gambling]] syndicate, and as a youth was arrested several times. He claimed that one psychologist's report at the time labelled him a [[Psychopathy|psychopath]].<ref name="psycho">{{cite web| url=http://www.sfsite.com/11b/sadg212.htm| author=Sandy Auden| title=Heroic Intentions: an interview with David Gemmell| publisher=SF Site (originally appearing on [[Syfy (UK and Ireland)|Sci-Fi Channel UK]]) | year=2005| access-date=24 November 2007 }}</ref>

Gemmell went on to work as a [[Manual labour|labourer]], a lorry-driver's mate, and a nightclub [[bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]] before his mother set up a job interview with a local newspaper. Of 100 applicants, he was probably the least qualified for the position but was hired owing to his display of arrogance during the interview, which was mistaken for self-confidence. He went on to work as a journalist for several local newspapers in [[East Sussex]], for five of  which he eventually became [[editor-in-chief]].<ref name="times">{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article695557.ece | title=David Gemmell Obituary | newspaper=[[The Times]] | date=1 August 2006 | access-date=24 November 2007  | location=London}}</ref> He also worked [[freelancer|freelance]] as a [[Stringer (journalism)|stringer]] for the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', and ''[[Daily Express]]'' national newspapers.<ref name="psycho"/><ref name="priest">{{cite news | url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,,1835232,00.html| author=Christopher Priest | title=Obituary: David Gemmell | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | date=2 August 2006 | access-date=24 November 2007 | author-link=Christopher Priest (novelist) }}</ref>

Coming from a staunch [[socialism|socialist]] family, Gemmell carried banners and campaigned for eventual [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Harold Wilson]] in the 1960s, although he nevertheless admitted a grudging alignment with [[Thatcherism|Thatcherite]] policies on issues of foreign policy, especially the [[Falklands War|Falklands Conflict]],<ref name="nicholls"/> and with [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]]ite views on [[Eastern world|East]]-[[Western world|West]] relations.<ref name="sff"/>

==Writing career==

Gemmell first attempted writing a novel in the 1970s, but ''The Man from Miami'' failed to find a publisher. He later admitted that the book "was so bad it could curdle milk at 50 paces."<ref name="sff"/><ref name="times"/> In 1976, after being diagnosed with a cancer he believed to be terminal, he wrote ''The Siege of Dros Delnoch'' in order to take his mind off his illness and to realise his ambition of having a novel published before he died.<ref name="priest"/> Written in two weeks, the novel told of a [[siege]] resisted against overwhelming odds, at the time serving as a metaphor for his illness; the fortress at the center of the tale was Gemmell, the invaders were his cancer. Leaving the ending of the novel open, he planned to let the fortress stand or fall dependent upon his own prognosis.<ref name="nicholls">{{cite web | url=http://www.deathwalker.co.uk/GCStan.htm  | title=David Gemmell Interview | author=Stan Nicholls | author-link=Stan Nicholls | publisher=deathwalker.co.uk (Gemmell fansite) | year=1989| access-date=26 November 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070519114511/http://www.deathwalker.co.uk/GCStan.htm |archive-date = 19 May 2007}}</ref> When Gemmell later learned that he had suffered a misdiagnosis, he set ''The Siege of Dros Delnoch'' to one side until 1980, when a friend read the manuscript and convinced Gemmell to sharpen up the novel in order to make one last attempt at publication. It was accepted in 1982 and published in 1984 under the new title, ''[[Legend (Gemmell novel)|Legend]]'', going on to achieve considerable commercial success.<ref name="nicholls"/><ref name="times"/> Gemmell said that while it had "all the flaws you expect in a first novel", the writing of ''Legend'' was "a golden time" in his life, citing it as the favourite of all his novels. He said that while he could "write it better" after becoming an established author, "[its heart] wouldn't be bettered by improving its style."<ref name="sff"/> Gemmell's journalism career overlapped with his career writing novels until the publication of his third novel ''[[Waylander (novel)|Waylander]]'' in 1986, when he was fired after using colleagues' names for characters in the book. Gemmell later said that his Managing Director had regarded it "a poisonous attack on his integrity."<ref name="bbc">{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/5224868.stm | title=Fantasy writer Gemmell dies at 57 | work=[[BBC News Online]] | date=26 July 2006 | access-date=23 November 2007 }}</ref>

After the publication of ''Waylander'', Gemmell became an author full-time, writing over thirty novels in total, some as part of long-running series, others as standalone works. Most of his novels were in the [[heroic fantasy]] genre; ''White Knight, Black Swan'' was a crime [[thriller (genre)|thriller]], appearing under the [[pseudonym]] Ross Harding, and was Gemmell's only novel not to become a bestseller.<ref name="times"/> Two of Gemmell's novels have also been adapted into [[graphic novel]] format. Gemmell's books have sold more than one million copies.<ref name="times"/>

==Personal life==
Gemmell married twice; his first marriage to Valerie<ref>{{cite book|last=Gemmell|first=David|title=Legend|year=1984|quote=This book is dedicated with love to three very special people. ... And my wife, Valerie}}</ref> produced two children before he met his second wife, Stella who had already been acknowledged in many of his books.<ref name="stella"/> The couple made their home in [[Hastings]] on the south-east coast of England until the author's death.<ref name="priest"/>

==Death, posthumous publication and legacy==

| style="text-align: left;" | Gemmell preferring to go to bed late, with his wife favouring an early start, on 28 July 2006 she was surprised to wake up to discover the bed empty. "I thought, 'Oh good, he must be working', and went to take him a cup of tea in his study." Finding him slumped over his desk, she "hoped he was asleep but I knew, really, that he was dead."

In mid-2006, Gemmell was on a trip to [[Alaska]] when he became discomforted. He immediately travelled back to the UK, where he underwent [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|quadruple heart bypass surgery]] in a private [[London]] hospital. Within two days he was able to take physical exercise and returned home to resume work on his latest novel.<ref name="priest"/> On the morning of 28 July 2006, four days before his 58th birthday, Gemmell was discovered by his wife, slumped over his computer, having died of [[Coronary heart disease|coronary artery disease]].<ref name="stella"/>

At the time of his death, Gemmell had completed 70,000 words of the final novel in his Troy series, an alternative-history trilogy based upon the legend of the [[Trojan War|siege of Troy]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sfreviews.net/troy2gemmell.html | title=''Troy: Shield of Thunder'' review | author=Wagner, Thomas M. | website=SFReviews.net | year=2007| access-date=27 November 2007 }}</ref> Only hours after his death, Gemmell's wife Stella resolved to complete the second half of the novel based upon his chapter plan and notes, and she contacted Gemmell's publisher two weeks after his funeral in order to make the offer. As a former junior reporter, aspiring novelist, and subeditor, and having been involved in Gemmell's writing process for a number of years, Stella Gemmell felt she was "the only one who could do it." Preparing for the task, she reread her husband's previous work, deconstructing the battle scenes in order to build her own. ''Troy: Fall of Kings'' was published in 2007 under the joint authorship of David and Stella Gemmell.<ref name="stella">{{cite news | url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/fiction/article2320620.ece | title=Last Writes | author=Wheatley, Jane | work=[[The Times]] | date=25 August 2007 | access-date=27 November 2007  | location=London}}</ref>

Up until his death, Gemmell was also patron of the [[Hastings Writers' Group]], following founder member [[Catherine Cookson]]. As patron, he was the main judge in the national literary competition run by the group, the Legend Writing Award, which was named after his breakthrough novel.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.legendwritingaward.co.uk | website=legendwritingaward.co.uk|title=Legend Writing Award | access-date=3 May 2009 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514013717/http://www.legendwritingaward.co.uk/ | archive-date=14 May 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nawg.co.uk/Showcase%20Hastings.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060523020100/http://www.nawg.co.uk/Showcase%20Hastings.htm |archive-date=23 May 2006 |title=Hastings Writers' Group |website=nawg.co.uk|access-date=27 November 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2008, the [[David Gemmell Legend Award]] was established, intended to "restore fantasy to its proper place in the literary pantheon"; a steering group of 18 authors is chaired by writer [[Stan Nicholls]], and the award is decided by a public vote.

Military historian Ross Cowan dedicated ''For the Glory of Rome: A History of Warriors and Warfare'' (2007) to Gemmell: "This book is dedicated to the memory of David Gemmell. He wrote about warriors and heroes, many of them ancient Greeks and Romans. His novel Ghost King introduced me to the legend of the Ninth Legion and ignited my interest in the Roman army."<ref>{{cite news|author=Cowan, Ross | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=dxw_DwAAQBAJ&q=Gemmell&pg=PA9  |work=For the Glory of Rome|title=Dedication|date = 30 June 2017|page= 9|isbn = 9781473898790}} (Google Books preview.)</ref><ref>Cowan, Ross, [https://www.karwansaraypublishers.com/awblog/review-simon-elliott-roman-britains-missing-legion/ 'History as it Ought to Have Been'], ''Ancient Warfare'' magazine blog, 12 April 2021.</ref>

==Influences and themes==
{| class="toccolours" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;" cellspacing="5"
| style="text-align: left;" | " The Alamo had a big effect on me when I first read about it. Unfortunately I now know the truth about the Alamo… The Alamo is a consistent story of cock-up after cock-up. Nobody there expected to die. I'm not saying they weren't very brave men. But the whole thing was mismanaged to the point of ineptness... I don't like to believe that, but it's the reality of life, so perhaps I shouldn't have studied the Alamo. ''Legend'' is the Alamo spirit - or what should have been that spirit."
|-
| style="text-align: left;" | — David Gemmell on the influence of [[Battle of the Alamo|The Alamo]]<ref name="nicholls"/>
|}
Originally intending to be a historical novelist, Gemmell was intrigued by events which ended badly for the protagonists. Citing the [[Battle of the Alamo]] and the grisly fate of [[William Wallace]] as influences, he said that had he written about the 13th century Scottish revolutionary, he would have found a way in which Wallace was ultimately victorious despite the odds, then eventually realised this kind of storytelling would be more palatable in a [[fantasy]] setting.<ref name="nicholls"/>

Gemmell's work typically deals with themes of honour and loyalty, advancing age, lost causes and the possibility of redemption for even the most corrupt (he was interested in the "true nature" of heroes, considering most to be unreliably so). The consistent presence of redemption in Gemmell's work reflects his Christian beliefs. He claimed that all of his novels have a religious basis, calling them "essentially Christian books" and saying that Christianity stopped him from "promoting the cause of evil" by writing "mindless savagery" in the vein of [[Terry Harknett|George G. Gilman]]'s ''Edge'' westerns.<ref name="nicholls"/> Often didactic, his work typically features a charismatic warrior tortured by loss and self-doubt, who bands together with a group of unlikely companions in order to defeat a dark enemy, usually aided by mystical forces. While all his novels are violent, successes are often [[Pyrrhic victory|Pyrrhic]] and the villains complex.

Gemmell credited his time as a journalist with providing him with his pacey, succinct style, although critics labelled his work "[[Machismo|macho]]" and would often cite his limited vocabulary and the repetitive nature of his stories. Violent events usually provide the sole impetus for plot development, and are resolved by physical violence or heroics.

Gemmell, known for his strong characterisation, attributed this to his tendency to draw from real life; having been acquainted with violent men, he understood and enjoyed writing them.<ref name="times"/><ref name="priest"/> Gemmell based the hero from his novel ''Legend'' on his stepfather Bill Woodford, calling men like him "…the havens, the safe harbours of childhood. They are the watch hounds who keep the wolves at bay." Bill reappeared in many of Gemmell's subsequent novels, in many different forms. When Bill died during the writing of ''Ravenheart'', as a tribute Gemmell reworked the novel to give the "Bill" character centre stage.<ref name="transworld"/> Gemmell has also been cited as saying that a major influence was classic western movies, which is evidenced at the end of ''Stormrider'', the sequel to ''Ravenheart'', when some of his characters enter a mystical world akin to the Native American (First Nation) spirit world. References to John Wayne movies are also found throughout the first two books in the ''Rigante'' series, ''Sword in the Storm'' and even more-so in ''Midnight Falcon'', where his main character Bane, is a pugilist.
