His satire book, ''Chocolate Lenin,'' was released in 2012. It is speculative fiction, a well received satire/fantasy of near-future Russia, parodying contemporary science, technology, and politics. It received numerous favorable reviews.

In 2013 it was announced that his first novel, ''The Haven'', was re-released in a new oversize format. The book is widely considered to be a cult classic.
