==Biography==
Stallworthy was born in London.  His parents, [[John Stallworthy (obstetrician)|Sir John Stallworthy]] and Margaret Stallworthy, were from New Zealand and moved to England in 1934. Stallworthy started writing poems when he was only seven years old. He was educated at the [[Dragon School]], [[Rugby School]] and at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], where he won the [[Newdigate prize]]. His works include seven volumes of poetry, and biographies of [[Wilfred Owen]] and [[Louis MacNeice]]. He edited several anthologies and is particularly known for his work on [[war poetry]].

While researching the local history of New Zealand Stallworthy discovered an obscure volume entitled ''Early Northern Wairoa'' written by his great-grandfather, [[John Stallworthy]] (1854–1923), in 1916. From this book he learned that his great-great-grandfather, George Stallworthy (1809–1859), had left his birthplace of Preston Bissett in [[Buckinghamshire, England|Buckinghamshire]], England, for the [[Marquesas]] as a missionary. This discovery led in turn to him finding family-related letters in the archives of the [[London Missionary Society]]. Stallworthy's book ''A Familiar Tree'' (Oxford University Press, 1978) is a collection of poetry inspired by events depicted in these documents. ''Singing School'' is an autobiography which emphasises Stallworthy's development as a poet.

Stallworthy wrote a short summary of war poetry in the introductory chapter to the ''Oxford Book of War Poetry'' (Edited by Jon Stallworthy, [[Oxford University Press]], 1984), as well as editing several anthologies of war poetry and writing a biography of [[Wilfred Owen]].  In 2010 he received the Wilfred Owen Poetry Award from the Wilfred Owen Association.<ref>[http://www.wilfredowen.org.uk/wilfred-owen-association/wilfred-owen-poetry-award Wilfred Owen Association website].
