'''Ernest Bramah''' (20 March 1868<ref>Entry of Birth in 2nd Quarter 1868 Register, Hulme, Chorlton, Lancashire, volume 8C, p. 739.</ref>{{spaced en dash}}27 June 1942), whose name was recorded after his birth as '''Ernest Brammah Smith''', was an English author.<ref>The most recent biographical source is: Aubrey Wilson, ''The Search for Ernest Bramah'' (Creighton and Read 2007).</ref> He published 21 books and numerous short stories and features.  His humorous works were ranked with [[Jerome K. Jerome]] and [[W. W. Jacobs]], his detective stories with [[Conan Doyle]], his politico-science fiction with [[H. G. Wells]], and his supernatural stories with [[Algernon Blackwood]]. [[George Orwell]] acknowledged that Bramah's book What ''Might Have Been'' influenced his ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. Bramah created the characters [[Kai Lung]] and [[Max Carrados]].<ref>White, William (1964)."Ernest Bramah" and "Checklist." ''[[The Book Collector]]'' 13 no 1(spring):54-63.</ref>



==Early career==
'''Ernest Bramah Smith''' (on his birth certificate the spelling of his middle name is given phonetically, as 'Brammah') was born in [[Manchester]], England in 1868, the son of Charles Clement and Susannah (Brammah) Smith.  Aged 16, he dropped out of [[Manchester Grammar School]], having been close to the bottom in each subject. He went into farming, first as a farm pupil and then in his own right. He was supported by his father, who had risen in a short time from a factory hand to a wealthy man. The farming enterprise cost his father £100,000 in today's money, but it was while farming that Bramah began to contribute local vignettes to the ''[[Birmingham News]]''. Later he wrote a tongue-in-cheek book about his adventures in farming.<ref>White, William. "Country Correspondent to Editor and Novelist: Ernest Bramah (1868-1942)." ''Journalism Quarterly'' 44, no. 4 (1967)</ref>    It found few buyers, and was [[Remaindered book|remaindered]] and pulped, though his father agreed to support him while he made his way in [[Grub Street]] as a writer. He eventually obtained a position as secretary to [[Jerome K. Jerome]] and rose to become editor of one of Jerome's magazines. After leaving Jerome he edited other journals for a publishing firm that later went bankrupt.

==Writing career==
Bramah attained commercial and critical success with his creation of Kai Lung, an itinerant storyteller. He first appears in ''The Wallet of Kai Lung'' which was rejected by eight publishers before [[Grant Richards (publishing house)|Grant Richards]] published it in 1900. It was still in print a hundred years later. The Kai Lung stories are humorous tales set in China, often with fantasy elements such as dragons and gods.<ref>[[David Langford]], "Bramah, Ernest" in the [[Encyclopedia of Fantasy]], edited by [[John Clute]] and [[John Grant (author)|John Grant]], 1997, Orbit (pp. 135-36).<!-- ISBN needed --></ref>

With Kai Lung, Bramah invented a form of [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] English illustrated by the following passages:
*"Kai Lung rose guardedly to his feet, with many gestures of polite assurance and having bowed several times to indicate his pacific nature, he stood in an attitude of deferential admiration. At this display the elder and less attractive of the maidens fled, uttering loud and continuous cries of apprehension to conceal the direction of her flight".<ref>Bramah, Ernest (1922). ''Kai Lung's Golden Hours.'' London: Grant Richards Ltd., p. 9.</ref>
*"In particular, there is among this august crowd of Mandarins one Wang Yu, who has departed on three previous occasions without bestowing the reward of a single cash.  If the feeble and covetous Wang Yu will place in his very ordinary bowl the price of one of his exceedingly ill-made pipes, this unworthy person will proceed."<ref>Bramah, Ernest (1900). ''The Wallet of Kai Lung.'' London: Grant Richards, p. 124.</ref>
*"After secretly observing the unstudied grace of her movements, the most celebrated picture-maker of the province burned the implements of his craft, and began life anew as a trainer of performing elephants."<ref>Bramah (1922), p. 174.</ref>

The Kai Lung stories are studded with proverbs and aphorisms, such as the following:
* "He who lacks a single tael sees many bargains"<ref>Bramah (1922), p. 57.</ref>
* "It is a mark of insincerity of purpose to spend one’s time in looking for the sacred Emperor in low-class teashops"<ref>Bramah (1900), p. 6.</ref>
* "It has been said there are few situations in life that cannot be honourably settled, and without loss of time, either by suicide, a bag of gold or by thrusting a despised antagonist over the edge of a precipice on a dark night"<ref>Bramah (1922), p. 264.</ref>

Bramah also wrote political science fiction. ''What Might Have Been'', published in 1907 and republished as ''The Secret of the League'' in 1909, is an [[anti-socialist]] dystopia reflecting Bramah's conservative political views.<ref>[[John Clute]], "Bramah, Ernest", in ''[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]'' edited by Clute and [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Peter Nicholls]], Orbit, 1993 (pp. 15–56).<!-- ISBN needed --></ref> It was acknowledged by [[George Orwell]] as a source for ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. Orwell credited it with giving a considerably accurate prediction of the rise of Fascism.<ref>George Orwell, "Predictions of Fascism", originally published in the ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]'' on 12 July 1940, appearing in ''The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell'', Volume 2, pp. 47–48).</ref>

At a time when the [[English Channel]] had yet to be crossed by an aeroplane, Bramah foresaw aerial express trains traveling at 10,000 feet, a nationwide wireless-telegraphy network, a prototype fax machine and a cypher typewriter similar to the German [[Enigma machine]]. {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

In 1914, Bramah created Max Carrados, a blind detective. Given the outlandish idea that a blind man could be a detective, in the introduction to the second Carrados book ''The Eyes of Max Carrados,'' Bramah compared his hero's achievements to those of real-life blind people such as [[Nicholas Saunderson]], Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge, [[Blind Jack]] of Knaresborough the road builder, [[John Fielding]] the Bow Street Magistrate (of whom it was said he could identify 3,000 thieves by their voices), and [[Helen Keller]].

In 1929, Bramah wrote the book "English Regal Copper Coins" which was published by Methuen. The book concentrates on British copper coinage from 1671 during the reign of Charles II until the end of pure copper coin production during Victoria's reign in 1860.  The book is still used widely by numismatic auction houses throughout the world with Bramah reference numbers.  The section on coin rarity as a percentage of production for each year is still considered useful to date.<ref>[http://www.ernestbramah.com/books.htm Publications by Ernest Bramah] Retrieved 19 September 2021.</ref>

=="Interesting times" and other quotations==
Bramah has been credited with the invention of the saying, widely quoted as an ancient Chinese curse, "[[May you live in interesting times]]", along with "May you come to the attention of those in authority" and "May you find what you are looking for".<ref name="urlErnest Bramah News">{{cite web|url=http://www.ernestbramah.com/news.htm|title=Ernest Bramah News|access-date=22 October 2014}}</ref> However, these do not appear in the Kai Lung stories.

==Archives at Harry Ransom Center==

Bramah's manuscripts,correspondence and additional materials including his work for Jerome K. Jerome and as staff member at ''Today'', [[The Idler (1892–1911)]] and the Grosvenor Press  are held at the University of Texas [[Harry Ransom Center]]. A letter of 27 April 1923 from Bramah to Grant Richards explains he had never been to China.<ref>White, William. "Ernest Bramah on China: An Important Letter." ''PMLA : Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'' 87, no. 3 (1972): 511–13.</ref>

==Personal life and death==
Bramah was a very private man who did not make public any details of his personal life. He was married to Lucy Maisie Smith.<ref>Hendon & Finchley Times, 29 December 1939</ref>  He died at the age of 74 in [[Weston-super-Mare]], Somerset, leaving an estate valued at £15,172 ({{Inflation|UK|15172|1942|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}).<ref>Hartlepool Northern Daily Mail, 8 June 1943</ref> After his death, his widow presented a collection of all his published books to the Hammersmith borough libraries, for reference use only. Bramah had lived in Hammersmith for some 30 years, not far from [[Ravenscourt Park]].<ref>Letter from the borough librarian in ''The Times''; 1 June 1978</ref>
