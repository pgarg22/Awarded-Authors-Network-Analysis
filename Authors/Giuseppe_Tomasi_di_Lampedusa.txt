'''Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa''' ({{IPA-it|dʒuˈzɛppe toˈmaːzi di lampeˈduːza}}; December 23, 1896 – July 23, 1957) was an Italian writer and the last [[Prince of Lampedusa]]. He is most famous for his only novel, ''[[The Leopard|Il Gattopardo]]'' (first published posthumously in 1958), which is set in his native [[Sicily]] during the ''[[Risorgimento]]''. A taciturn and solitary man, he spent a great deal of his time reading and meditating, and used to say of himself, "I was a boy who liked solitude, who preferred the company of things to that of people."<ref>Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa, ''I Racconti'' (''Stories''), Universale Economica [[Feltrinelli (publisher)|Feltrinelli]], 2005, p. 53</ref>

==Biography==
Tomasi was born in [[Palermo]] to Giulio Maria Tomasi, [[Prince of Lampedusa]], Duke of [[Palma di Montechiaro]], [[Baron]] of [[Torretta]], and [[Grandee of Spain]] (1868–1934), and Beatrice Mastrogiovanni Tasca [[Filangieri]] di Cutò (1870–1946). He became an only child after the death (from [[diphtheria]]) in 1897 of his sister Stefania. He was very close to his mother, a strong personality who influenced him a great deal, especially because his father was rather cold and detached. As a child, he studied in their grand house in Palermo with a tutor (including the subjects of literature and English), with his mother (who taught him French), and with a grandmother who read him the novels of [[Emilio Salgari]]. In the little theater of the house in [[Santa Margherita di Belice]], where he spent long vacations, he first saw a performance of ''[[Hamlet]]'', performed by a company of travelling players. His cousin was [[Fulco di Verdura]].

Beginning in 1911, he attended the ''[[liceo classico]]'' in Rome and later in Palermo. He moved definitively to Rome in 1915 and enrolled in the faculty of [[jurisprudence]]. However, that year he was drafted into the army, fought in the lost [[battle of Caporetto]], and was taken prisoner by the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]. He was held in a POW camp in Hungary, but succeeded in escaping and returning to Italy. After being mustered out of the army as a lieutenant, he returned to Sicily, alternately resting there and travelling with his mother, and continuing his studies of foreign literature. It was during this time that he first drafted in his mind the ideas for his future novel ''[[The Leopard]]''. Originally his plan was to have the entire novel occur over the course of one day, similar to the famous modernist novel by [[James Joyce]], ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.

In 1932 in [[Riga]] he married the daughter of [[Alice Barbi]], [[Alexandra von Wolff-Stomersee]] (1894–1982), nicknamed "Licy", a [[Baltic German]] noblewoman and a student of [[psychoanalysis]]. The marriage ceremony was celebrated in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Annunciation of Our Most Holy Lady Church, Riga|Annunciation of Our Most Holy Lady Church]] in Riga. They first lived with Tomasi's mother in Palermo, but the incompatibility between the two women soon drove Licy back to Riga.<ref>[http://www.psychoanalytikerinnen.de/italien_biografien.html Alessandra Tomasi di Lampedusa] at psychoanalytikerinnen.de</ref>

In 1934 Tomasi di Lampedusa's father died, and he inherited his princely title. He was briefly called back to arms in 1940, but, as owner of a hereditary agricultural estate, was soon sent back home to take care of its affairs. He and his mother ultimately took refuge in [[Capo d'Orlando]], where he was reunited with Licy. They survived the war, but their palace in Palermo did not.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/29/arts/29iht-booktue.1.14826755.html|title=Essay: Lampedusa's 'The Leopard,' fifty years on|newspaper=The New York Times|date=28 July 2008|last1=Donadio|first1=Rachel}}</ref>

After his mother died in 1946, Tomasi returned to live with his wife in Palermo. In 1953 he began to spend time with a group of young intellectuals, one of whom was Gioacchino Lanza Tomasi, a cousin, with whom he developed such a close relationship that, the following year, he legally adopted him.

Tomasi di Lampedusa was often the guest of his cousin, the poet [[Lucio Piccolo]], with whom he travelled in 1954 to [[San Pellegrino Terme]] to attend a literary awards ceremony, where he met, among others, [[Eugenio Montale]] and [[Maria Bellonci]]. It is said that it was upon returning from this trip that he commenced writing ''Il Gattopardo'' (''[[The Leopard]]''), which was finished in 1956. During his life, the novel was rejected by the two publishers to whom Tomasi submitted it.

In 1957 Tomasi di Lampedusa was diagnosed with lung cancer; he died on July 23 in Rome.<ref>[https://palermo.repubblica.it/societa/2017/07/23/news/l_ultima_beffa_al_gattopardo_sulla_lapide_c_e_una_data_di_morte_sbagliata-171456343/ "L'ultima beffa al "Gattopardo", sulla lapide c'è una data di morte sbagliata"] [The latest joke at the ''Leopard'', on the tombstone is a wrong death date] by Giusi Spica, 23 July 2017, ''[[La Repubblica]]''</ref> Following a [[requiem]] in the [[Sacro Cuore di Gesù a Castro Pretorio|Basilica del Sacro Cuore di Gesù]] in Rome, he was buried three days later in the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] [[Catacombe dei Cappuccini|cemetery of Palermo]].<ref>[https://cimiteripalermo.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dscn0733.jpg Photo] of his gravestone</ref> His novel was published the year after his death.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/29/arts/29iht-booktue.1.14826755.html|title=Essay: Lampedusa's 'The Leopard,' fifty years on|newspaper=The New York Times|date=28 July 2008|last1=Donadio|first1=Rachel}}</ref>  {{ill|Elena Croce|it}} had sent it to the writer [[Giorgio Bassani]], who brought it to the attention of the [[Giangiacomo Feltrinelli|Feltrinelli]] publishing house.

==Works==

''[[The Leopard|Il Gattopardo]]'' follows the family of its title character, Sicilian nobleman Don Fabrizio Corbera, Prince of Salina, through the events of the Risorgimento.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/may/03/featuresreviews.guardianreview22|title=A place in the sun|date=3 May 2003}}</ref> Perhaps the most memorable line in the book is spoken by Don Fabrizio's nephew, Tancredi, urging unsuccessfully that Don Fabrizio abandon his allegiance to the disintegrating [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] and ally himself with [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] and the [[House of Savoy]]: "Unless we ourselves take a hand now, they'll foist a republic on us. If we want things to stay as they are, things will have to change."<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057091/quotes Memorable quotes for ''Il Gattopardo''], ''The Internet Movie Database''</ref>

The title is rendered in English as ''The Leopard'', but the Italian word ''gattopardo'' refers to the American [[ocelot]] or to the African [[serval]]. ''Il gattopardo'' may be{{citation needed|date=December 2020}} a reference to a wildcat that was hunted to extinction in Italy in the mid-19th century – just as Don Fabrizio was dryly contemplating the indolence and decline of the Sicilian aristocracy.

In 1963 ''[[The Leopard (1963 film)|Il Gattopardo]]'' was made into a film, directed by [[Luchino Visconti]] and starring [[Burt Lancaster]], [[Alain Delon]], and [[Claudia Cardinale]]; it won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].

Tomasi also wrote some lesser-known works: ''I racconti'' (''Stories'', first published 1961), including the novella ''[[The Professor and the Siren]]'', ''Le lezioni su Stendhal'' (''Lessons on [[Stendhal]]'', privately published in 1959, published in book form in 1977), and ''Invito alle lettere francesi del Cinquecento'' (''Introduction to sixteenth-century French literature'', first published 1970). In 2010, a collection of his letters were published in English as ''Letters from London and Europe''. His perceptive commentaries on English and other foreign literatures make up a greater part of his works by volume than does his fiction.

==Legacy==
The [[Asteroid belt|main-belt]] [[asteroid]] [[14846 Lampedusa]] is named after him.

On the occasion of the 14th edition of the [[Rome Film Festival]], the docufilm ''Die Geburt des Leoparden'', directed by Luigi Falorni, was screened. A journey to discover the life of the last Prince of Lampedusa told by the voices and testimonies of loved ones.

In 2019 Canadian novelist Steven Price published a novelized biography of Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa entitled ''Lampedusa''.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kolbe |first1=Laura |title=''Lampedusa'' Review: Spotting the Leopard – A historical novel about the Sicilian prince who wrote a superb work of fiction about the birth of Italy|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/lampedusa-review-spotting-the-leopard-11572016191?mod=djembooks|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=25 October 2019}}</ref>
