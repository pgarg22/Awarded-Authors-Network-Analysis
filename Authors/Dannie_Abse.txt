'''Daniel Abse''' [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] [[FRSL]] (22 September 1923 – 28 September 2014) was a Welsh poet and physician.<ref name="Telegraph obit">{{Cite news |title=Dannie Abse – obituary |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11126588/Dannie-Abse-obituary.html |access-date=21 January 2016 |work=The Telegraph |date=28 September 2014}}</ref> His poetry won him many awards. As a medic, he worked in a chest clinic for over 30 years.

==Early years==
Abse was born in [[Cardiff]], Wales, as the younger brother of the politician and [[Reform movement|reformer]] [[Leo Abse]] and the eminent [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Wilfred Abse]]. Unusually for a middle-class Jewish boy, Dannie Abse attended [[St Illtyd's Catholic High School|St Illtyd's College]], a working-class Catholic school in [[Splott]]. Abse studied medicine, first at the [[University of Wales College of Medicine]] and then at [[Westminster Hospital Medical School]] and [[King's College London]].<ref name="Telegraph obit"/>

Abse was a passionate supporter of [[Cardiff City]] football club. He first went to watch them play in 1934 and many of his writings refer to his experiences watching and lifelong love of the team known as "The Bluebirds".{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}

==Career as poet==
[[File:Dannie Abse (2014).jpg|right|200px|thumb|Abse in 2014]]
Although best known as a poet, Abse worked in the medical field, and was a physician in a [[Chest medicine|chest clinic]] for over thirty years.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Goldbeck-Wood |first1=Sandy |title=Dannie Abse – Last act in the theatre of disease |journal=British Medical Journal |date=13 December 2014 |page=25 |url=http://www.bmj.com/bmj/section-pdf/816196?path=/bmj/349/7987/Obituaries.full.pdf}}</ref> He received numerous literary awards and fellowships for his writing. In 1989, he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Wales.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}

His first volume of poetry, ''After Every Green Thing'', was published in 1949.<ref name="Dannie Abse"/> His [[autobiography|autobiographic]] work, ''Ash on a Young Man's Sleeve'', was published in 1954. He won the Welsh Arts Council Award in both 1971 and 1987, and the [[Cholmondeley Award]] in 1985. He was a Fellow of [[The Royal Society of Literature]] from 1983. In a foreword to ''Collected Poems 1948–1976'', Abse noted that his poems are increasingly "rooted in actual experience," both domestic and professional, and many display a reconciliation between Jewish and Welsh themes and traditions.<ref>''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'', 6th edition, edited by Margaret Drabble (Oxford, UK: OUP, 2000), p. 2.</ref>

Abse lived for several decades in the north-west area of London, mainly near [[Hampstead]], where he had considerable ties. For several years he wrote a column for the local ''[[Hampstead and Highgate Express]]''. These articles subsequently appeared in book form.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}

In 2005, his wife [[Joan Abse|Joan]] was killed in a car accident, while Abse suffered a broken rib. His poetry collection, ''Running Late'', was published in 2006, and ''The Presence'', a memoir of the year after his wife died, was published in 2007; it won the 2008 [[Wales Book of the Year]] award.<ref name="Dannie Abse">[http://www.contemporarywriters.com/authors/?p=auth151 Dannie Abse<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606043107/http://www.contemporarywriters.com/authors/?p=auth151 |date=6 June 2011 }}</ref> The book was later dramatised for [[BBC Radio 4]]. He was awarded the Roland Mathias prize for ''Running Late''.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Dannie Abse |url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/dannie-abse |publisher=Poetry Foundation |access-date=6 August 2012}}</ref>

In 2009, Abse brought out a volume of collected poetry. In the same year, he received the [[Wilfred Owen]] Poetry Award. Abse was a judge for the inaugural 2010 [[Hippocrates Prize for Poetry and Medicine]]. Abse was appointed [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in the 2012 New Year Honours for services to poetry and literature.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=60009 |date=31 December 2011 |page=6 |supp=y}}</ref>
