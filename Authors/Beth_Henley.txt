==Criticism==
The themes in her plays often consider the importance of love, the contrast between family love and romantic love,<ref>Andreach, Robert (2006). Understanding Beth Henley. Columbia, South Carolina: University of South Carolina. {{ISBN|1-57003-639-X}}.</ref> how family and society define and confine her female characters,<ref name=history /> and the alienation and suffering of the human condition. Characters in her plays may seek happiness but are betrayed by modern civilization.<ref name=FBH/> Henley's work suggests the influence of Freud's [[psychoanalytic theory]]. Her Southern sense of the grotesque and absurd experienced in daily existence have caused her to be compared to other southern writers such as [[Eudora Welty]] and [[Flannery O'Connor]], or to be considered part of the [[Southern Gothic]] tradition.<ref name=FBH>{{cite journal|last=Plunka|first=Gene|title=Freudian Psychology and Beth Henley's Popular Culture Satire: Signature|journal=The Journal of Popular Culture|date=July 3, 2006|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5931.2006.00283.x|volume=39|issue=4|pages=639–660}}</ref>

Her plays written in the 1980s have been characterized as naturalistic portrayals of the relationship between the inner self and the world,<ref>Andreach, Robert (2006). ''Understanding Beth Henley''. Columbia, South Carolina: University of South Carolina. {{ISBN|1-57003-639-X}}. page 10.</ref> and her characters often are outsiders and nonconformists unable to share their feelings and experiences.<ref name="Andreach, Robert 2006"/> Her plays of the 1990s, including ''Abundance'', the first play not set in the South, are considered more experimental than her earlier work.<ref>Andreach, Robert (2006). ''Understanding Beth Henley''. Columbia, South Carolina: University of South Carolina. {{ISBN|1-57003-639-X}}. page 53.</ref> Henley applies new techniques and styles in these plays.<ref>Hucheon, Linda. "The Politics of Parody", ''The Politics of Postmodernism'', New York: Routledge, 1989. pp. 93–117</ref> Her play ''Revelers'' employs some older and traditional theatre techniques.<ref name="Andreach, Robert 2006"/>
