==Biography==
Marion was born in Birkenhead, Cheshire, of Welsh parents – William Griffith Eames (1885–1959) and his wife Gwladys Mary (née Jones) (1891–1979) – but she was brought up from the age of four at [[Dolgellau]], [[Merionethshire]] (Sir Feirionnydd), where she attended [[Dr Williams' School]]. A talented musician, who played the harp and the piano, she graduated from the [[Guildhall School of Music and Drama]] in London.

Marion worked as a librarian in Dolgellau, then at [[University of Wales, Aberystwyth|Aberystwyth University]], before becoming a [[radio]] producer with the [[BBC]] in [[Cardiff]] from 1955 to 1980. She also served for a time as a regional organizer for the political party [[Plaid Cymru]]. In 1955 she married the [[Quaker]] journalist Griffith Williams, with whom she moved to [[Pimlico]], then back to Cardiff.<ref name="Welsh bio" />

Eames was an early scriptwriter for the long-running Welsh soap ''[[Pobol Y Cwm]]''. Her best-known work of fiction is the historical novel ''Y Stafell Ddirgel'' (1969), which was translated into English by Margaret Phillips as ''[[The Secret Room]]'' (1975). This was later adapted as a BBC television drama series,<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/tgau/llenyddiaeth_gymraeg/nofel_a_barddoniaeth/nofel/y_stafell_ddirgel/revision/2/ BBC Bitesize (Welsh)]</ref> and has been reprinted in both languages.

Other works by Eames include ''I hela cnau'' (1978, in English: ''The Golden Road'', 1990). A sequel to ''Y Stafell Ddirgel'' was ''Y Rhandir Mwyn'' (The Fair Wilderness).<ref>British Library [http://explore.bl.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/search.do?ct=&pag=&indx=1&dscnt=0&scp.scps=scope%3A(BLCONTENT)&frbg=&tab=local_tab&dstmp=1490032301216&srt=rank&ct=Next%20Page&mode=Basic&vl(488279563UI0)=any&dum=true&tb=t&indx=21&vl(freeText0)=Marion%20Eames&fn=search&vid=BLVU1 Retrieved 20 March 2017.]</ref> Marion Eames was awarded an honorary degree of the University of Wales.
