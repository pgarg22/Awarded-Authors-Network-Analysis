'''Gordon Bottomley''' (20 February 1874{{snd}}25 August 1948) was an English poet, known particularly for his [[verse drama]]s. He was partly disabled by tubercular illness. His main influences were the later Victorian [[Romantic poetry|Romantic poets]], the [[Pre-Raphaelite]]s and [[William Morris]].

==Background==

Bottomley was born in [[Keighley]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]] on 20 February 1874, the only child of Maria and Alfred Bottomley. He was educated firstly at home by his mother and then at the local [[grammar school]]. Aged seven, Bottomley contracted a [[Tuberculosis|tubercular]] illness that would affect him for the rest of his life. As a result he was invalided for long periods of time and was unable to travel widely or live in a town.

Bottomley became a junior clerk at the Craven Bank in Keighley at the age of 16. However, after an illness in 1891 he was transferred to the [[Bradford]] branch. Here he first visited the theatre and saw the [[Oscar Wilde]] play ''[[Lady Windermere's Fan]]''. This stimulated his interest in plays.

Following another bout of illness in 1892 Bottomley left the bank and moved to [[Cartmel]], [[Lancashire]] to ''live a life of passionate intense meditation and contemplation''<ref>http://www.tulliehouse.co.uk/pages.asp?type=M&url=265_Emily+and+Gordon+Bottomley+Bequest&lvl=,48,78,265{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }},</ref> and began writing poetry. It was here in 1895 that he met Emily Burton. They married in 1905. The couple lived from 1914 in [[Silverdale, Lancashire|Silverdale]], near [[Carnforth]] until their deaths. In the 1920s he was president of the [[Village Drama Society]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|date=29 November 1928|title=Drama In The Villages|page=12|work=The Times (London)}}</ref> In 1944 he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters at the University of Leeds.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dewhirst|first1=Ian|title=Author grateful for his education in Keighley|url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/11191463.Author_grateful_for_his_education_in_Keighley/|website=Keighley News}}</ref> Bottomley died in 1948, outliving his wife by less than a year. Their ashes are interred at St. Fillan's Chapel at the base of [[Dundurn, Scotland|Dundurn]], [[Perthshire]].

==Influences and writing==

Bottomley began writing poetry in the 1890s and was influenced by the [[Romantic poetry|Romantic poets]] and even more so by such later figures as [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti|Rossetti]] and [[Algernon Swinburne]].<ref>D. Davies ed., ''The Penguin Companion to Literature I'' (Penguin 1971) p. 58</ref> Bottomley included many famous writers, poets and artists as friends.  While he mainly kept in contact with them through letters, he did make occasional visits to London, and also received visitors such as [[Arthur Ransome]] and [[Edward Thomas (poet)|Edward Thomas]] at his home. 

His first book ''The Mickle Drede and Other Verses'' was printed privately at [[Kendal]] in 1896, and he wrote many more poems and plays, generally performed by amateurs or in experimental theatre.<ref>D. Davies ed., ''The Penguin Companion to Literature I'' (Penguin 1971) p. 58</ref>  Bottomley also edited the poetry of [[Isaac Rosenberg]] in 1922, whom as a correspondent he had encouraged from 1915; while his close associate the composer [[Edgar Bainton]] (1880–1956) set ''The Crier by Night'' to music.

An early [[environmentalism|environmentalist]],<ref>J. Black, ''A History of the British Isles'' (2012) p. 261</ref> Bottomley's writing was always closely grounded in geographical location.<ref>I. Ousby ed., ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (Cambridge 1995) p. 104</ref> A Scottish influence (echoing [[Yeats]]' Irish revival) appears in his late plays,<ref>D. Davies ed., ''The Penguin Companion to Literature I'' (Penguin 1971) p. 58-9</ref> while much of his earlier writing was rooted in Lakeland.  Thus for example the ghost or bogle of [[Claife Heights]], Windemere - the so-called Claife Crier - is used to resolve the conflict between a cruel farmers-wife and a serving maid in ''The Crier by Night'';<ref>G. Lindop, ''A Literary Guide to the Lake District'' (London 1993) p. 404</ref> while one of his best-loved poems is known as ''Cartmel Bells'':

"O, Cartmel bells ring soft tonight/And Cartmel bells ring clear,
But I lie far away tonight,/Listening with my dear;

Listening in a frosty land/
Where all the bells are still..."<ref>Quoted in G. Lindop, ''A Literary Guide to the Lake District'' (London 1993) p. 284</ref>

==Art collecting==
Among the most notable of his friendships was that with the artist [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]]. The two men were brought together in 1910 by Nash’s love of poetry and Bottomley’s extensive knowledge of painting. Bottomley encouraged the young artist and in exchange Nash made several designs for Bottomley’s plays that he exhibited or used as illustrations. Despite increasingly divergent tastes in art, their friendship survived and a prolific lifelong correspondence<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/ARTnash.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024231448/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/ARTnash.htm |archive-date=24 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> between the two men was published in 1955.<ref>Poet and Painter by Gordon Bottomley and Paul Nash, {{ISBN|978-1-872971-15-5}}</ref>

Bottomley studied the work of artists and was a dedicated collector. He bought artworks when he could afford to and his friends also gave him their art in gratitude for his support and friendship. In the 1940s Bottomley and his wife Emily gave their personal art collection of six hundred paintings, prints and drawings to the [[Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery]] in [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], [[Cumberland]]. The bequest included a nationally important collection of works by the Pre-Raphaelites including pictures by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], [[Edward Burne-Jones]], [[William Morris]], [[Arthur Hughes (artist)|Arthur Hughes]], [[Ford Madox Brown]], [[Elizabeth Siddal]] and [[Simeon Solomon]]. The collection also included work from artists of other genre including those of [[Stanley Spencer]], [[Samuel Palmer]], [[Albert Joseph Moore|Albert Moore]], [[Frederic Leighton, 1st Baron Leighton|Frederic, Lord Leighton]], [[Henri Fantin-Latour]], [[Lucien Pissarro]], [[William Nicholson (artist)|William Nicholson]], [[Walter Crane]], [[Charles Conder]], [[Jessie Marion King]], William Morris's daughter [[May Morris]], [[William Rothenstein]], [[Charles Ricketts]] and of course [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]].
