'''Helene Johnson''' (July 7, 1906 – July 7, 1995) was an [[African-American]] poet during the [[Harlem Renaissance]]. She was also a cousin of author [[Dorothy West]].

==Career==
Johnson's literary career began when she won first prize in a short story competition sponsored by the ''[[Boston Chronicle]]''. She also received an honorable mention in a poetry contest organized by ''[[Opportunity: A Journal of Negro Life|Opportunity]]'', the journal of the [[National Urban League]] that was a leading showcase for the talents of African-American artists.

She reached the height of her popularity in 1927 when her poem "Bottled" was published in the May issue of ''[[Vanity Fair (American magazine 1913-1936)|Vanity Fair]]''. In 1935, Johnson’s last published poems appeared in ''Challenge: A Literary Quarterly''.

She continued to write a poem a day for the rest of her life.

== Personal life ==
Johnson, whose given name was Helen, spent her early years at her grandfather’s house in Boston. The rest of her formative years were spent in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]].

She and [[Dorothy West]] moved to Harlem in the 1920s, where they became friends with such artists as [[Zora Neale Hurston]]. Johnson attended [[Columbia University]], but did not graduate.

In 1933, Johnson married William Warner Hubbell III. The couple had one child, Abigail, before divorcing.

Johnson died in [[Manhattan]] at the age of 88.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/11/obituaries/helene-johnson-poet-of-harlem-89-dies.html|title=Helene Johnson, Poet of Harlem, 89, Dies|last=Pace|first=Eric|access-date=2018-03-10|language=en|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 11, 1995}}</ref>
