'''Aphra Behn''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|f|r|ə|_|b|ɛ|n}};{{efn|She inherited this name from her German husband; the German pronunciation is {{IPA-de|beːn|}}.}} [[baptism|bapt.]]&nbsp;14 December 1640<ref>{{cite web|title=Aphra Behn (1640–1689)|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/behn_aphra.shtml|website=BBC|access-date=19 April 2017}}</ref> – 16 April 1689) was an English playwright, poet, translator and fiction writer from the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration era]]. As one of the first English women to earn her living by her writing, she broke cultural barriers and served as a literary role model for later generations of women authors. Rising from obscurity, she came to the notice of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who employed her as a spy in [[Antwerp]].  Upon her return to London and a probable brief stay in [[debtors' prison]], she began writing for the stage. She belonged to a coterie of poets and famous [[libertines]] such as [[John Wilmot, Lord Rochester]]. She wrote under the pastoral pseudonym [[Astraea (mythology)|Astrea]]. During the turbulent political times of the [[Exclusion Crisis]], she wrote an epilogue and prologue that brought her into legal trouble; she thereafter devoted most of her writing to prose genres and translations.  A staunch supporter of the Stuart line, she declined an invitation from [[Gilbert Burnet|Bishop Burnet]] to write a welcoming poem to the new king [[William III of England|William III]]. She died shortly after.<ref name=ODNB>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/1961 Janet Todd], "Behn, Aphra (1640?–1689)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004</ref>

She is remembered in [[Virginia Woolf]]'s ''[[A Room of One's Own]]'': "All women together ought to let flowers fall upon the tomb of Aphra Behn which is, most scandalously but rather appropriately, in [[Westminster Abbey]], for it was she who earned them the right to speak their minds."<ref>{{Cite book |title = A Room of One's Own|last = Woolf|first = Virginia |publisher = Harcourt Brace |year = 1929 |oclc = 326933 |location = New York |pages = 69}}</ref> Her grave is not included in the [[Poets' Corner]] but lies in the East Cloister near the steps to the church.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |url = http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/famous-people?collection=wma-people&query=behn|title = Westminster Abbey|year = 2015|access-date = 30 October 2015|website = Westminster Abbey}}</ref>

==Life and work==

===Versions of her early life===
[[File:Behn Oroonoko title page.1688.jpg|thumb|right|Title page of the first edition of ''[[Oroonoko]]'' (1688)]]
Information regarding Behn's life is scant, especially regarding her early years. This may be due to intentional obscuring on Behn's part. One version of Behn's life tells that she was born to a barber named John Amis and his wife Amy; she is occasionally referred to as ''Aphra Amis Behn''.<ref name="Foundation">{{cite web |url = http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/aphra-behn|title = Aphra Behn|last = Stiebel|first = Arlene|publisher = Poetry Foundation|access-date = 30 October 2015}}</ref> Another story has Behn born to a couple named Cooper.<ref name=Foundation/> ''The Histories and Novels of the Late Ingenious Mrs. Behn'' (1696) states that Behn was born to Bartholomew Johnson, a barber, and Elizabeth Denham, a [[wet nurse|wet-nurse]].<ref name=Foundation/><ref name="Brit">{{cite encyclopedia |url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/58760/Aphra-Behn |title = Aphra Behn |encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica Online |access-date = 30 October 2015}}</ref> Colonel Thomas Colepeper, the only person who claimed to have known her as a child, wrote in ''Adversaria'' that she was born at "[[Sturry]] or [[Canterbury]]"{{efn|[[Sturry]] is a small village a few miles north-east of the city of [[Canterbury]] in [[Kent]].}} to a Mr Johnson and that she had a sister named Frances.<ref name=ODNB/> Another contemporary, [[Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea|Anne Finch]], wrote that Behn was born in [[Wye, Kent|Wye in Kent]], the "Daughter to a Barber".<ref name=ODNB/> In some accounts the profile of her father fits Eaffrey Johnson.<ref name=ODNB/> Although not much is known about her early childhood, one of her biographers, Janet Todd, believes that the common religious upbringing at the time could have heavily influenced much of her work. She argued that throughout Behn's writings that her experiences in church were not of religious fervor, but instead chances for her to explore her sexual desires, desires that will later be shown through her plays. In one of her last plays she writes "I have been at the Chapel; and seen so many Beaus, such a Number of Plumeys, I cou'd not tell which I shou'd look on the most...".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Todd|first=Janet|title=The Secret Life of Aphra Behn|publisher=Andre Deutsch Limited|year=1996|isbn=0-8135-2455-5|location=London|pages=19-20|language=English}}</ref>

=== Education ===
Although Behn's writings show some form of education, it is not clear how she obtained the education that she did. It was somewhat taboo for women at the time to receive a formal education, Janett Todd notes. Although some aristocratic girls in the past were able to receive some form of education, that was most not likely the case for Aphra Behn based on the time she lived.  Self-tuition was practiced by European women during the 17th century, but it relied on the parents to allow that to happen. She most likely spent time copying poems and other writings, which not only inspired her but educated her.  It is important to note that Aphra was not alone in her quest of self-tuition during this time period, and there are other notable women such as the first female medical doctor [[Dorothea Erxleben|Dorothea Leporin]] who made efforts to self-educate.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/298467847|title=Women, education, and agency, 1600-2000|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|others=Jean Spence, Sarah Jane Aiston, Maureen M. Meikle|isbn=978-0-415-99005-9|location=New York|oclc=298467847}}</ref> In some of her plays, Aphra Behn show's disdain towards this English ideal of not educating women formally. She also, though, seemed to believe that learning Greek and Latin, two of the [[Classical language|classical languages]] at the time, were not as important as many authors thought it to be. She may have been influenced by another writer named [[Francis Kirkman]] who also lacked knowledge of Greek or Latin, who said "you shall not find my English, Greek, here; nor hard cramping Words, such as will stop you in the middle of your Story to consider what is meant by them...". Later in life, Aphra would make similar gestures to ideas revolving around formal education.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Todd|first=Janet|title=The Secret Life of Aphra Behn|publisher=Andre Deutsch Limited|year=1996|isbn=0-8135-2455-5|location=London|pages=21-23|language=English}}</ref>

Behn was born during the buildup of the [[English Civil War]], a child of the political tensions of the time. One version of Behn's story has her travelling with a Bartholomew Johnson to the small English colony of [[Surinam (English colony)|Surinam]] (later [[Surinam (Dutch colony)|captured]] by the Dutch). He was said to die on the journey, with his wife and children spending some months in the country, though there is no evidence of this.<ref name=Foundation/><ref name=Cambridge/> During this trip Behn said she met an African slave leader, whose story formed the basis for one of her most famous works, ''[[Oroonoko]]''.<ref name=Foundation/><ref name="Brit"/> It is possible that she acted a spy in the colony.<ref name=ODNB/> There is little verifiable evidence to confirm any one story.<ref name=Foundation/> In ''Oroonoko'' Behn gives herself the position of narrator and her first biographer accepted the assumption that Behn was the daughter of the lieutenant general of Surinam, as in the story. There is little evidence that this was the case, and none of her contemporaries acknowledge any aristocratic status.<ref name=ODNB/><ref name=Foundation/> There is also no evidence that Oroonoko existed as an actual person or that any such [[slave revolt]], as is featured in the story, really happened.

Writer [[Germaine Greer]] has called Behn "a [[palimpsest]]; she has scratched herself out," and biographer [[Janet Todd]] noted that Behn "has a lethal combination of obscurity, secrecy and staginess which makes her an uneasy fit for any narrative, speculative or factual. She is not so much a woman to be unmasked as an unending combination of masks".<ref name=Cambridge/> It is notable that her name is not mentioned in tax or church records.<ref name=Cambridge/> During her lifetime she was also known as Ann Behn, Mrs Behn, agent 160 and Astrea.<ref name="Intro">Todd, Janet (2013) ''The Secret Life of Aphra Behn;'' Rutgers University Press; {{ISBN|978-0813524559}}</ref>

===Career===
[[File:Aphra Behn.jpg|thumb|A sketch of Aphra Behn by [[George Scharf]] from a portrait believed to be lost (1873)]]
Shortly after her supposed return to England from Surinam in 1664, Behn may have married Johan Behn (also written as Johann and John Behn). He may have been a merchant of German or Dutch extraction, possibly from [[Hamburg]].<ref name=Foundation/><ref name=Cambridge/> He died or the couple separated soon after 1664, however from this point the writer used "Mrs Behn" as her professional name.<ref name="Brit"/>

Behn may have had a [[Catholic]] upbringing. She once commented that she was "designed for a nun," and the fact that she had so many Catholic connections, such as [[Henry Neville (writer)|Henry Neville]] who was later arrested for his Catholicism, would have aroused suspicions during the anti-Catholic fervour of the 1680s.<ref name="goreau">{{cite book|first = Angeline|last = Goreau|year = 1980|title = Reconstructing Aphra: A Social Biography of Aphra Behn|publisher = Dial Press|isbn = 0-8037-7478-8|url = https://archive.org/details/reconstructingap0000gore}}</ref> She was a monarchist, and her sympathy for the Stuarts, and particularly for the Catholic [[Duke of York]] may be demonstrated by her dedication of her play ''The Rover II'' to him after he had been exiled for the second time.<ref name=goreau/> Behn was dedicated to the restored King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]. As political parties emerged during this time, Behn became a [[Tory]] supporter.<ref name=goreau/>

By 1666 Behn had become attached to the court, possibly through the influence of [[Thomas Colepeper (colonel)|Thomas Culpeper]] and other associates. The [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] had broken out between England and the Netherlands in 1665, and she was recruited as a political spy in [[Antwerp]] on behalf of King Charles II, possibly under the auspices of courtier [[Thomas Killigrew]].<ref name=ODNB/><ref name=Foundation/><ref name="Brit"/> This is the first well-documented account we have of her activities.<ref name=Cambridge/> Her code name is said to have been ''Astrea'', a name under which she later published many of her writings.<ref name=Foundation/> Her chief role was to establish an intimacy with William Scot, son of [[Thomas Scot]], a regicide who had been executed in 1660. Scot was believed to be ready to become a spy in the English service and to report on the doings of the English exiles who were plotting against the King. Behn arrived in [[Bruges]] in July 1666, probably with two others, as London was wracked with plague and fire. Behn's job was to turn Scot into a [[double agent]], but there is evidence that Scot betrayed her to the Dutch.<ref name=ODNB/><ref name=Cambridge/>

Behn's exploits were not profitable however; the cost of living shocked her, and she was left unprepared. One month after arrival, she pawned her jewellery.<ref name=Cambridge/> King Charles was slow in paying (if he paid at all), either for her services or for her expenses whilst abroad. Money had to be borrowed so that Behn could return to London, where a year's petitioning of Charles for payment was unsuccessful. It may be that she was never paid by the crown. A warrant was issued for her arrest, but there is no evidence it was served or that she went to prison for her debt, though apocryphally it is often given as part of her history.<ref name=ODNB/><ref name="Cambridge">{{cite book |title = The Cambridge Companion to Aphra Behn|url = https://archive.org/details/cambridgecompani00dere|url-access = registration|year = 2004|editor= Derek Hughes |editor2=Janet Todd|publisher = Cambridge University|pages = [https://archive.org/details/cambridgecompani00dere/page/1 1–10]|isbn = 978-0521527200}}</ref>
[[File:Aphra Behn by Mary Beale 2.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait by [[Mary Beale]]]]

Forced by debt and her husband's death, Behn began to work for the [[King's Company]] and the [[Duke's Company]] players as a scribe. She had, however, written poetry up until this point.<ref name=Foundation/> While she is recorded to have written before she adopted her debt, John Palmer said in a review of her works that, "Mrs. Behn wrote for a livelihood. Playwriting was her refuge from starvation and a debtor's prison."<ref name="Palmer">{{Cite news|title=Writ By a Woman|last=Palmer|first=John|date=14 August 1915|work=Saturday Review of Politics, Literature, Science and Art}}</ref> The theatres that had been closed under [[Cromwell]] were now re-opening under Charles II, plays enjoying a revival. Her first play, ''The Forc’d Marriage,'' was staged in 1670, followed by ''The Amorous Prince'' (1671). After her third play, ''The Dutch Lover,'' failed, Behn falls off the public record for three years. It is speculated that she went travelling again, possibly in her capacity as a spy.<ref name=Cambridge/> She gradually moved towards comic works, which proved more commercially successful.<ref name="Brit"/> Her most popular works included ''[[The Rover (play)|The Rover]]''.

Behn became friends with notable writers of the day, including [[John Dryden]], [[Elizabeth Barry]], [[John Hoyle (died 1692)|John Hoyle]], [[Thomas Otway]] and [[Edward Ravenscroft]], and was acknowledged as a part of the circle of the [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester|Earl of Rochester]].<ref name=ODNB/><ref name=Cambridge/> Behn often used her writings to attack the parliamentary [[Whig (British political faction)|Whigs]] claiming, "In public spirits call’d, good o' th' Commonwealth... So tho' by different ways the fever seize...in all 'tis one and the same mad disease." This was Behn's reproach to parliament which had denied the king funds.<ref name=goreau/>

===Final years and death===
In 1688, in the year before her death, she published ''A Discovery of New Worlds'', a translation of a French popularisation of [[astronomy]], ''[[Entretiens sur la pluralité des mondes]]'', by [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle]], written as a novel in a form similar to her own work, but with her new, religiously oriented preface.

In all she would write and stage 19 plays, contribute to more, and become one of the first prolific, high-profile female dramatists in Britain.<ref name=ODNB/> During the 1670s and 1680s she was one of the most productive playwrights in Britain, second only to [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]] [[John Dryden]].<ref name=Intro/>

In her last four years, Behn's health began to fail, beset by poverty and debt, but she continued to write ferociously, though it became increasingly hard for her to hold a pen. In her final days, she wrote the translation of the final book of [[Abraham Cowley]]'s ''Six Books of Plants.'' She died on 16 April 1689, and was buried in the East Cloister of [[Westminster Abbey]]. The inscription on her tombstone reads: "Here lies a Proof that Wit can never be Defence enough against Mortality."<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.poetsgraves.co.uk/behn.htm|title = Aphra Behn|publisher = Cameron Self, Poets' Graves|access-date = 30 October 2015}}</ref> She was quoted as stating that she had led a "life dedicated to pleasure and poetry."<ref name=ODNB/><ref name=Cambridge/><ref name="calgary">{{cite web |url = http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/%7emamaes/17a.html|title = 17th Century Women|publisher = University of Calgary|access-date = 30 October 2015}}</ref>

==Published works==
Behn earned a living writing, one of the earliest Englishwomen to do so. After [[John Dryden]] she was the most prolific writer of the [[English Restoration]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Rereading Aphra Behn: History, Theory, and Criticism | editor= Heidi Hutner|publisher=University of Virginia Press|year=1993|isbn= 978-0813914435|pages=18}}</ref> Behn was not the first woman in England to publish a play. In 1613 [[Elizabeth Cary, Viscountess Falkland|Lady Elizabeth Cary]] had published ''The Tragedy of Miriam'', in the 1650s [[Margaret Cavendish]] published two volumes of plays, and in 1663 a translation of [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]]'s ''Pompey'' by [[Katherine Philips]] was performed in Dublin and London.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Shakespeare, Aphra Behn and the Canon | authors= Lizbeth Goodman & W.R.

Owens| publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn= 978-1135636289|pages=140}}</ref>

Behn's first play ''[[The Forc'd Marriage]]'' was a romantic tragicomedy on [[arranged marriages]] and was staged by the [[Duke's Company]] in September 1670. The performance ran for six nights, which was regarded as a good run for an unknown author. Six months later Behn's play ''The Amorous Prince'' was successfully staged. Again, Behn used the play to comment on the harmful effects of arranged marriages. Behn did not hide the fact that she was a woman, instead she made a point of it. When in 1673 the [[Dorset Garden Theatre]] staged ''[[The Dutch Lover]]'', critics sabotaged the play on the grounds that the author was a woman. Behn tackled the critics head on in ''Epistle to the Reader''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Shakespeare, Aphra Behn and the Canon | authors= Lizbeth Goodman & W.R. Owens| publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn= 978-1135636289|pages=141}}</ref> She argued that women had been held back by their unjust exclusion from education, not their lack of ability. After a three-year publication pause, Behn published four plays in close succession. In 1676 she published ''[[Abdelazar]]'', ''[[The Town Fop or, Sir Timothy Tawdry|The Town Fop]]'' and ''[[The Rover (play)|The Rover]]''. In early 1678 ''[[Sir Patient Fancy]]'' was published. This succession of box-office successes led to frequent attacks on Behn. She was attacked for her private life, the morality of her plays was questioned and she was accused of plagiarising ''The Rover''. Behn countered these public attacks in the prefaces of her published plays. In the preface to ''Sir Patient Fancy'' she argued that she was being singled out because she was a woman, while male playwrights were free to live the most scandalous lives and write [[bawdy]] plays.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Shakespeare, Aphra Behn and the Canon | authors= Lizbeth Goodman & W.R. Owens| publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn= 978-1135636289|pages=142}}</ref>

Under [[Charles II of England]] prevailing [[Puritan]] ethics was reversed in the fashionable society of London. The King associated with playwrights that poured scorn on [[marriage]] and the idea of consistency in [[love]]. Among the King's favourites was the [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester|Earl of Rochester John Wilmot]], who became famous for his cynical libertinism.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Shakespeare, Aphra Behn and the Canon | authors= Lizbeth Goodman & W.R. Owens| publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn= 978-1135636289|pages=143}}</ref> Behn was a friend of Wilmot and Behn became a bold proponent of sexual freedom for both women and men. Like her contemporary male libertines, she wrote freely about sex. In the infamous poem ''The Disappointment'' she wrote a comic account of male [[impotence]] from a woman's perspective.<ref name="Routledge">{{Cite book|title=Shakespeare, Aphra Behn and the Canon | authors= Lizbeth Goodman & W.R. Owens| publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn= 978-1135636289|pages=145}}</ref> Critics Lisa Zeitz and Peter Thoms contend that the poem "playfully and wittily questions conventional gender roles and the structures of oppression which they support".<ref name="Zeitz">{{cite journal|last1=Zeitz|first1=Lisa M.|last2=Thoms|first2=Peter|title=Power, Gender, and Identity in Aphra Behn's "The Disappointment"|journal=SEL: Studies in English Literature 1500–1900|date=1997|volume=37|issue=3|pages=501–516|doi=10.2307/451046|jstor=451046}}</ref> In ''The Dutch Lover'' Behn forthrightly acknowledged female sexual desire. Critics of Behn were provided with ammunition because of her public liaison with [[John Hoyle (died 1692)|John Hoyle]], a [[bisexual]] lawyer who scandalised his contemporaries.<ref name="Routledge"/>

By the late 1670s Behn was among the leading playwrights of England. Her plays were staged frequently and attended by the King. ''The Rover'' became a favourite at the King's court. Behn became heavily involved in the political debate about the succession. Because Charles II had no heir a prolonged political crisis ensued. Mass hysteria commenced as in 1678 the rumoured [[Popish Plot]] suggested the King should be replaced with his [[Roman Catholic]] brother [[James II of England|James]]. Political parties developed, the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] wanted to exclude James, while the [[Tories]] did not believe succession should be altered in any way. Charles II eventually dissolved the [[Cavalier Parliament]] and James II succeeded him in 1685. Behn supported the Tory position and in the two years between 1681 and 1682 produced five plays to discredit the Whigs. The London audience, mainly Tory sympathisers, attended the plays in large numbers. But Behn was arrested on the order of King Charles II when she used one of the plays to attack [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|James Scott, Duke of Monmouth]], the illegitimate son of the King.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Cite book|title=Shakespeare, Aphra Behn and the Canon | authors= Lizbeth Goodman & W.R. Owens| publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn= 978-1135636289|pages=146}}</ref>

As audience numbers declined, theatres staged mainly old works to save costs. Nevertheless, Behn published ''[[The Luckey Chance]]'' in 1686. In response to the criticism levelled at the play she articulated a long and passionate defence of women writers. Her play ''[[The Emperor of the Moon]]'' was published and staged in 1687, it became one of her longest running plays.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Behn stopped writing plays and turned to prose fiction. Today she is mostly known for the novels she wrote in the later part of her life. Her first novel was the three-part ''[[Love-Letters Between a Nobleman and His Sister]]'', published between 1682 and 1687. The novels were inspired by a contemporary scandal, which saw [[Ford Grey, 1st Earl of Tankerville|Lord Grey]] elope with his sister-in-law [[Lady Henrietta Berkeley]].<ref name="Henrietta">{{Cite ODNB|id=68002|title=Berkeley, Lady Henrietta [Harriett]}}</ref> At the time of publication ''Love Letters'' was very popular and went through more than 16 editions.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{Cite book|title=Shakespeare, Aphra Behn and the Canon | authors= Lizbeth Goodman & W.R.

In 1688, less than a year before her death, Behn published ''[[Oroonoko]]: or, The Royal Slave'', the story of the enslaved Oroonoko and his love Imoinda. It was based on Behn's travel to [[Surinam]] twenty years earlier. The novel became a great success. In 1696 it was adapted for the stage by [[Thomas Southerne]] and continuously performed throughout the 18th century. In 1745 the novel was translated into French, going through seven French editions. As [[abolitionism]] gathered pace in the late 18th century the novel was celebrated as the first anti-slavery novel.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

==Legacy and re-evaluation==
After her death in 1689, Behn's literary work was marginalised and often dismissed outright, notwithstanding the 1700 publication of her ''Histories, Novels, and Translations'' which preserved her literary production for future re-discovery.<ref name=CoxOUP>Cox, Michael, ed. (2004). ''The Concise Oxford Chronology of English Literature''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-860634-6}}.</ref> Until the mid-20th century Behn was repeatedly dismissed as a morally depraved minor writer. In the 18th century her literary work was scandalised as lewd by [[Thomas Brown (satirist)|Thomas Brown]], [[William Wycherley]], [[Richard Steele]] and [[John Duncombe]]. [[Alexander Pope]] penned the famous lines "The stage how loosely does Astrea tread, Who fairly puts all characters to bed!". In the 19th century [[Mary Hays]], [[Matilda Betham]], [[Alexander Dyce]], [[Jane Williams]] and [[Julia Kavanagh]] decided that Behn's writings were unfit to read, because they were corrupt and deplorable. Among the few critics who believed that Behn was an important writer were [[Leigh Hunt]], [[William Forsyth (writer)|William Forsyth]] and [[William Henry Hudson]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Rereading Aphra Behn: History, Theory, and Criticism | editor= Heidi Hutner|publisher=University of Virginia Press|year=1993|isbn= 978-0813914435|pages=2}}</ref>

The life and times of Behn were recounted by a long line of biographers, among them Dyce, [[Edmund Gosse]], [[Ernest Bernbaum]], [[Montague Summers]], [[Vita Sackville-West]], [[Virginia Woolf]], [[George Woodcock]], William J. Cameron and Frederick Link.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Rereading Aphra Behn: History, Theory, and Criticism | editor= Heidi Hutner|publisher=University of Virginia Press|year=1993|isbn= 978-0813914435|pages=2–3}}</ref>

Of Behn's considerable literary output only ''Oroonoko'' was seriously considered by literary scholars. This book, published in 1688, is regarded as one of the first abolitionist and humanitarian novels published in the English language. It is credited as precursor to [[Jean-Jaques Rousseau]]'s ''Discourses on Inequality''. Since the 1970s Behn's literary works have been re-evaluated by [[feminist]] critics and writers. Behn was rediscovered as a significant female writer by [[Maureen Duffy]], Angeline Goreau, [[Ruth Perry]], Hilda Lee Smith, Moira Ferguson, Jane Spencer, [[Dale Spender]], Elaine Hobby and [[Janet Todd]]. This led to the reprinting of her works. ''The Rover'' was republished in 1967, ''Oroonoko'' was republished in 1973, ''Love Letters between a Nobleman and His Sisters'' was published again in 1987 and ''The Lucky Chance'' was reprinted in 1988.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Rereading Aphra Behn: History, Theory, and Criticism | editor= Heidi Hutner|publisher=University of Virginia Press|year=1993|isbn= 978-0813914435|pages=3}}</ref> [[Montague Summers]], an author of scholarly works on the English drama of the 17th century, published a six-volume collection of her work, in hopes of rehabilitating her reputation. Summers was fiercely passionate about the work of Behn and found himself incredibly devoted to the appreciation of 17th century literature.<ref name="Palmer"/> [[Felix Emanuel Schelling|Felix Schelling]] wrote in ''The Cambridge History of English Literature'', that she was "a very gifted woman, compelled to write for bread in an age in which literature... catered habitually to the lowest and most depraved of human inclinations," and that, "Her success depended upon her ability to write like a man." [[Edmund Gosse]] remarked that she was, "...the [[George Sand]] of the Restoration".<ref>{{cite book |title=British Authors Before 1800: A Biographical Dictionary|editor=Stanley Kunitz |editor2=Howard Haycraft|location=New York|publisher=H.W. Wilson|year=1952|page=36}}</ref>

The criticism of Behn's poetry focuses on the themes of gender, sexuality, femininity, pleasure, and love. A feminist critique tends to focus on Behn's inclusion of female pleasure and sexuality in her poetry, which was a radical concept at the time she was writing. One critic, Alison Conway, views Behn as instrumental to the formation of modern thought around the female gender and sexuality: "Behn wrote about these subjects before the technologies of sexuality we now associate were in place, which is, in part, why she proves so hard to situate in the trajectories most familiar to us".<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Flesh on the Mind: Behn Studies in the New Millennium|journal=The Eighteenth Century|volume=44|issue=1|pages=87–93|last=Conway|first=Alison|date=2003|jstor=41467917}}</ref> [[Virginia Woolf]] wrote, in ''[[A Room of One's Own]]'':

<blockquote>
All women together, ought to let flowers fall upon the grave of Aphra Behn... for it was she who earned them the right to speak their minds... Behn proved that money could be made by writing at the sacrifice, perhaps, of certain agreeable qualities; and so by degrees writing became not merely a sign of folly and a distracted mind but was of practical importance.<ref name=woolf>[[Virginia Woolf|Woolf, Virginia]]. ''[[A Room of One's Own]]''. 1928, at 65</ref>
</blockquote>

In recognition of her pioneering role in women's literature, Behn was featured during the "Her Story" video tribute to notable women on [[U2]]'s North American tour in 2017 for the 30th anniversary of ''[[The Joshua Tree]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.u2songs.com/news/updated_the_women_of_ultra_violet_light_my_way|title=The Women of Ultra Violet: Light My (Mysterious) Ways: Leg 1|first=Initial design & architecture by Carl Uebelhart.
