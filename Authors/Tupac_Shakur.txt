Much of Shakur's music has been noted for addressing contemporary social issues that plagued inner cities, and he is considered a symbol of activism against inequality.

Shakur was born in [[Manhattan]], New York City, but relocated to [[Baltimore, Maryland]] in 1984 and then the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] in 1988. He moved to Los Angeles in 1993 to further pursue his music career.

==Music career==

Shakur began recording using the stage name ''MC New York'' in 1989. That year, he began attending the poetry classes of [[Leila Steinberg]], and she soon became his manager.<ref>{{cite web|title=Leila Steinberg|url=http://www.hearteducation.org/leila.html |publisher=Assemblies in Motion |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213024039/http://www.hearteducation.org/leila.html|archive-date=February 13, 2008 |access-date=January 25, 2009}}</ref><ref name=":5" /> Steinberg organized a concert for Shakur and his rap group Strictly Dope.

In 1988, [[Stretch (rapper)|Randy "Stretch" Walker]], along with his brother, dubbed Majesty, and a friend debuted with an EP as rap group and production team, [[Live Squad]], in the [[Queens]] borough of New York City.<ref name=":0">{{cite news | first = Charisse | last = Jones | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/01/nyregion/rapper-slain-after-chase-in-queens.html | title = Rapper slain after chase in Queens | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = December 1, 1995 | page = B 3 | access-date = May 17, 2020 | archive-date = April 8, 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200408090314/https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/01/nyregion/rapper-slain-after-chase-in-queens.html | url-status = live }}</ref> Shakur's early days with [[Digital Underground]] made his acquaintance with Stretch, who featured on a track of the Digital Underground's 1991 album ''[[Sons of the P]]''. Becoming fast friends, Shakur and Stretch recorded and performed together often.<ref name=":0" />

In January 1991 Shakur debuted Under the stage name 2Pac on [[Digital Underground]], under a new record label, [[Interscope Records]], on the group's January 1991 single "[[Same Song (Digital Underground song)|Same Song]]", the song was featured on the soundtrack of the 1991 film ''[[Nothing but Trouble (1991 film)|Nothing but Trouble]]'', starring [[Dan Aykroyd]], [[John Candy]], [[Chevy Chase]], and [[Demi Moore]].<ref name=":5" /> The song opened the group's January 1991 EP titled ''[[This Is an EP Release]]'',<ref name=":5" /> while Shakur appeared in the music video. 

Stretch as well as Live Squad contributed tracks on Shakur's first two albums, [[2Pacalypse Now]] (November 1991), [[Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...]] (February 1993), and on Shakur's side group [[Thug Life]]'s [[Thug Life: Volume 1|only album]] of September 1994.

Tupac released ''[[Thug Life: Volume 1]]'' in 1994, the only album with his side group [[Thug Life]].<ref> The album is subtitled ''Volume 1'' since Thug Life's roster had been intended to grow and evolve over time.</ref> Rapper/producer [[Stretch (rapper)|Stretch]] guests on the three albums.

The end of Shakur's and Stretch's friendship in late 1994 surprised the New York rap scene.<ref name=":0" /> The next Shakur album, released in March 1995, lacks Stretch, and Shakur's album after that, released in February 1996, has lines suggesting Stretch's impending death for betrayal. No objective evidence would publicly emerge to tangibly incriminate Stretch in the gun attack on Shakur, while with Stretch and two others, at about 12:30&nbsp;am on November 30, 1994. In any case, after a Live Squad production session for [[It Was Written|the second album of Queens rapper Nas]], Stretch's vehicle was chased while receiving fatal gunfire at about 12:30&nbsp;am on November 30, 1995.<ref name=":0" />

Shakur's third solo album, ''[[Me Against the World]]'' (1995), features rap clique Dramacydal, reshaping as [[Outlawz]] on Shakur's fourth solo album, and last in his lifetime, ''[[All Eyez on Me]]'' (1996).

=== ''2Pacalypse Now'' ===
{{Main|2Pacalypse Now}}
Shakur's debut album, ''[[2Pacalypse Now]]''—alluding to the 1979 film ''[[Apocalypse Now]]''—arriving in November 1991, would bear three singles.

US Vice President [[Dan Quayle]] partially reacted, "There's no reason for a record like this to be released. It has no place in our society." Tupac, finding himself misunderstood,<ref name="not-a-ganster" /> explained, in part, "I just wanted to rap about things that affected young Black males.

{{Main|Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...}}

Shakur's second album, ''[[Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...]]'', arrived in February 1993. A critical and commercial advance, it debuted at No. 24 on the pop albums chart, the [[Billboard 200]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/2Pac/chart-history/TLP|title=2Pac – Album chart history|work=Billboard|accessdate=June 14, 2021}}</ref> An overall more hardcore album, it emphasizes Tupac's sociopolitical views, and has a metallic production quality. It features [[Ice Cube]], the famed primary creator of [[N.W.A|N.W.A's]] "[[Fuck tha Police]]", who, in his own solo albums, had newly gone militantly [[Political rap|political]], along with L.A.'s original gangsta rapper, [[Ice-T]], who in June 1992 had sparked controversy with his band [[Body Count (band)|Body Count]]'s track "[[Cop Killer (song)|Cop Killer]]".

In fact, in its vinyl release, side A, tracks 1 to 8, is labeled the "Black Side", while side B, tracks 9 to 16, is the "Dark Side". Nonetheless, the album carries the single "[[I Get Around (Tupac Shakur song)|I Get Around]]", a party anthem featuring Digital Underground's [[Shock G]] and [[Money-B]], which would render Shakur's popular breakthrough, reaching No. 11 on the pop singles chart, the [[Billboard Hot 100]]. And it carries the optimistic compassion of another hit, "[[Keep Ya Head Up]]", an anthem for women empowerment. This album would be [[certified Platinum]], with a million copies sold. As of 2004, among Shakur albums, including of posthumous and compilation albums, the ''Strictly'' album would be 10th in sales, about 1,366,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web|title={{As written|Remebering}} Tupac: His Musical Legacy and His Top Selling Albums |url=http://atlantapost.com/2010/09/16/tupacs-album-sales-and-his-persisting-legacy56988/ |publisher=Atlantapost.com|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220212220/http://atlantapost.com/2010/09/16/tupacs-album-sales-and-his-persisting-legacy56988/ |archive-date=February 20, 2011|access-date=March 10, 2012}}</ref>

In late 1993, Shakur formed the group [[Thug Life]] with Tyrus "[[Big Syke]]" Himes, Diron "Macadoshis" Rivers, his stepbrother [[Mopreme Shakur]], and Walter "Rated R" Burns. Thug Life released its only album, ''[[Thug Life: Volume 1]]'', on October 11, 1994, which is certified Gold. It carries the single "Pour Out a Little Liquor", produced by [[Johnny "J"|Johnny "J" Jackson]], who would also produce much of Shakur's album ''All Eyez on Me''. Usually, Thug Life performed live without Tupac.<ref>{{cite video|title=Thug Life: Vol. 1 |date=1994 |medium=CD}}</ref> 

The track also appears on the 1994 film ''[[Above the Rim]]''<nowiki/>'s soundtrack. Due to [[gangsta rap]] being under heavy criticism at the time, the album's original version was scrapped, and the album redone with mostly new tracks. Still, along with Stretch, Tupac would perform the first planned single, "Out on Bail", which was never released, at the 1994 Source Awards.<ref>{{cite web|title=2Pac – Out On Bail (live 1994)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiubB9awJUA|date=January 8, 2007|publisher=YouTube|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226224847/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiubB9awJUA|archive-date=February 26, 2013|access-date=March 12, 2012}}{{Unreliable source?|date=March 2020}}</ref>

=== Death Row signs Shakur ===

In 1995 Tupac was imprisoned, impoverished, and his mother was about to lose her house, Shakur had his wife Keisha Morris get word to Marion "Suge" Knight, in Los Angeles, boss of [[Death Row Records]].<ref name=":6" /> Reportedly, Shakur's mother promptly received $15,000.<ref name=":6" /> After an August visit to [[Clinton Correctional Facility]] in northern New York state, Suge traveled southward to New York City to join Death Row's entourage to the 2nd Annual Source Awards ceremony.<ref name=":6" /> 

Already reputed for strongarm tactics on the Los Angeles rap scene, Suge used his brief stage time mainly to disparage [[Sean Combs|Sean "Puff Daddy" Combs]], boss of Bad Boy Entertainment, the label then leading New York rap scene, who routinely performed with his own artists.<ref name=":4">{{cite book | first1 = Derrick | last1 = Parker | first2 = Matt | last2 = Diehl | title = Notorious C.O.P.: The Inside Story of the Tupac, Biggie, and Jam Master Jay Investigations from the NYPD's First "Hip-Hop Cop" | location = New York | publisher = St. Martin's Griffin | year = 2007 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=aW1CdaYjwDgC&pg=PA113 | pages = 113–116 | isbn = 9781429907781 | access-date = May 20, 2020 | archive-date = September 15, 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200915032409/https://books.google.com/books?id=aW1CdaYjwDgC&pg=PA113 | url-status = live }}</ref><ref name=":10" /> Before closing with a brief comment of support for Shakur,<ref name=":11">{{cite web | first = Nadirah | last = Simmons | url = https://thesource.com/2016/08/03/today-in-1995-the-2nd-annual-source-awards-makes-hip-hop-history | title = Today in 1995: The 2nd Annual Source Awards makes hip hop history | work = [[The Source]] | date = August 3, 2016 | access-date = May 17, 2020 | archive-date = July 1, 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200701034838/https://thesource.com/2016/08/03/today-in-1995-the-2nd-annual-source-awards-makes-hip-hop-history/ | url-status = live }}</ref> Suge invited artists seeking the spotlight for themselves to join Death Row.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":10">{{cite web | first = Erika | last = Ramirez | url = https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/6363520/throwback-thursday-suge-knight-diddy-1995-source-awards | title = Throwback Thursday: Suge Knight Disses Diddy at 1995 Source Awards | work = Billboard.com | date = December 4, 2014 | access-date = May 17, 2020 | archive-date = May 2, 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200502072146/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/6363520/throwback-thursday-suge-knight-diddy-1995-source-awards | url-status = live }}</ref> Eventually, Puff recalled that to preempt severe retaliation from his Bad Boy orbit, he had promptly confronted Suge, whose reply—that he had meant [[Jermaine Dupri]], of [[So So Def Recordings]], in Atlanta—was politic enough to deescalate the conflict.<ref name=":8">{{cite magazine | first = Peter A. | last = Barry | url = https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2016/11/diddy-claims-confronted-suge-source-awards/ | title = Diddy claims he confronted Suge Knight after infamous 1995 Source Awards speech | magazine = [[XXL (magazine)|XXL]] Magazine | date = November 30, 2016 | access-date = May 17, 2020 | archive-date = January 26, 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190126200037/http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2016/11/diddy-claims-confronted-suge-source-awards/ | url-status = live }}</ref>

==Personal life==

In Shakur's adulthood he continued befriending individuals of diverse backgrounds. 

=== Biggie and Junior M.A.F.I.A. ===
{{See also|The Notorious B.I.G.}}
During 1993 and 1994, the [[Biggie Smalls]] guest verses on several singles, often R&B, like Mary J. Blige's "[[What's the 411? Remix]]", set high expectations for his debut album. The perfectionism of Puffy, still forming his Bad Boy label, extended its recording to 18 months. In 1993, visiting Los Angeles, Biggie asked a local drug dealer for an introduction to Shakur, who then welcomed Biggie and friends to Shakur's house and treated them to recreational activities. The pair would socialize when Shakur went to New York, or Biggie to Los Angeles.<ref name=":6" />

During this period, at his own live shows, Shakur would call Biggie onto stage to rap with him and Stretch.<ref name=":6">{{cite web | first = Ben | last = Westhoff | url = https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/gqkqz3/tupac-biggie-friends-to-foes | title = How Tupac and Biggie went from friends to deadly rivals | work = [[Vice.com]] | date = September 12, 2016 | access-date = May 16, 2020 | archive-date = August 14, 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200814121519/https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/gqkqz3/tupac-biggie-friends-to-foes | url-status = live }}</ref> Together, they recorded the songs "[[Runnin' from tha Police]]" and "House of Pain". Reportedly, Biggie asked Shakur to manage him, whereupon Shakur advised him that Puffy would make him a star.<ref name=":6" /> Yet in the meantime, Shakur's lifestyle was comparatively lavish, whereas Biggie appeared to continue wearing the same pair of boots for perhaps a year.<ref name=":6" /> Shakur welcomed Biggie to join his side group Thug Life.<ref name=":6" /> Biggie would instead form his own side group, the [[Junior M.A.F.I.A.]], with his Brooklyn friends [[Lil' Cease]] and [[Lil' Kim]].

=== Underworld ===
Despite the "weird" timing of [[Stretch (rapper)|Stretch's shooting death]],<ref name=":0" /> a theory implicates gunman Ronald "Tenad" Washington both here and in the 2002 murder of Run-DMC's [[Jam Master Jay]] via, as the unverified theory speculates, [[Kenneth "Supreme" McGriff]] punishing the rap mentor for recording [[50 Cent]] despite Supreme's prohibition after this young rapper's 1999 song "[[Ghetto Qu'ran (Forgive Me)|Ghetto Qu'ran]]" had mentioned activities of the Queens drug gang Supreme Team.<ref name=":9">{{cite encyclopedia | first = Melissa Ursula Dawn | last = Goldsmith | title = Jam Master Jay | editor1-first = M. | editor1-last = Goldsmith | editor2-first = Anthony J. | editor2-last = Fonseca | encyclopedia = Hip Hop around the World: An Encyclopedia | location = Santa Barbara, California | publisher = Greenwood | year = 2019 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6mR2DwAAQBAJ&q=Stretch+Tenad+Supreme+Jam++Cent&pg=PA364 | page = 364 | isbn = 9780313357596 | access-date = October 15, 2020 | archive-date = December 8, 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20201208044807/https://books.google.com/books?id=6mR2DwAAQBAJ&q=Stretch+Tenad+Supreme+Jam++Cent&pg=PA364 | url-status = live }}</ref> Supreme was a friend, rather, of [[Irv Gotti]], cofounder of [[Murder Inc Records]],<ref name=":9" /> whose rapper [[Ja Rule]] would vie among New York rappers after the March 1997 shooting death of Biggie, visiting Los Angeles.

==== Haitian Jack ====
By some accounts, the role Birdie, played by Shakur in the 1994 film ''[[Above the Rim]]'', had been modeled on a New York underworld tough, [[Jacques Agnant|Jacques "Haitian Jack" Agnant]],<ref name=":7">{{cite magazine | first = Jason | last = Rodriguez | url = https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2011/09/pit-of-snakes-2pacs-quad-studios-shooting-excerpt-from-sept-2011-issue | title = Pit of snakes | magazine = [[XXL (magazine)|XXL]] Magazine | date = September 2011 | access-date = May 16, 2020 | archive-date = February 19, 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190219061305/http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2011/09/pit-of-snakes-2pacs-quad-studios-shooting-excerpt-from-sept-2011-issue/ | url-status = live }}</ref> a manager and promoter of rappers.<ref>{{cite web | first = Lesley | last = Goldberg | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/haitian-jack-hip-hop-miniseries-works-967201 | title = Haitian Jack hip-hop miniseries in the works (exclusive) | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date = January 23, 2017 | access-date = May 20, 2020 | archive-date = June 27, 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200627233640/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/haitian-jack-hip-hop-miniseries-works-967201 | url-status = live }}</ref> Reportedly, Shakur met him at a Queens nightclub, where, noticing him amid women and champagne, Shakur asked for an introduction.<ref name=":6" /> Reportedly, Biggie advised Shakur to avoid him, but Shakur disregarded the warning.<ref name=":6" />

In November 1993, in his Manhattan hotel room, Shakur received a woman's return visit. Soon, she alleged sexual assault by him and three other men there: his road manager Charles Fuller, aged 24, one Ricardo Brown, aged 30,<ref>{{cite news | first = Craig | last = Wolff | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/20/nyregion/rap-performer-is-charged-in-midtown-sex-attack.html | title = Rap performer is charged In Midtown sex attack | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = November 20, 1993 | page = §1:25 | access-date = May 20, 2020 | archive-date = June 6, 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200606032055/https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/20/nyregion/rap-performer-is-charged-in-midtown-sex-attack.html | url-status = live }}</ref> and a "Nigel", later understood as Haitian Jack.<ref name=":6" />

==== Jimmy Henchman ====
Through Haitian Jack, Shakur met [[Jimmy Henchman|James "Jimmy Henchman" Rosemond]].<ref name=":6" /> Another underworld figure formidable, Jimmy Henchman doubled as music manager.<ref name=":7" /> [[Bryce Wilson]]'s [[Groove Theory]] was an early client.<ref name=":7" /> [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]] as well as [[Gucci Mane]] were later clients.<ref name=":7" /> In 1994, a client lesser known, and signed to [[Uptown Records]], was rapper [[Little Shawn]], friend of Biggie and Lil' Cease.<ref name=":7" /> Eventually, Jack and Henchman would reportedly fall out, allegedly shooting at each other in Miami.<ref name=":7" /> And for his major drug trafficking, Henchman would be sent to prison on a life sentence.<ref name=":7" /> But in the early 1990s, Jack and Henchman reputedly shared interests, including a specialty of robbing and extorting music artists.<ref name=":7" />

==Legal issues==

=== Sexual assault case ===

In November 1993, Shakur and two other men were charged in New York with [[sodomy|sodomizing]] a woman in Shakur's hotel room. The woman, Ayanna Jackson, alleged that after consensual oral sex in his hotel room, she returned a later day, when Shakur forced her to perform non-consensual oral sex on him and two other men, his road manager Charles Fuller and  record executive [[Jacques Agnant|Jacques "Haitian Jack" Agnant]]. Shakur was also charged with [[illegal possession of a firearm]] as two guns were found in the hotel room.

=== Other criminal or civil cases ===

==== 1991 Oakland Police Department lawsuit ====
In October 1991, Shakur filed a $10&nbsp;million lawsuit against the [[Oakland Police Department]] for allegedly [[Police brutality|brutalizing]] him over [[jaywalking]]. The case was [[Settlement (litigation)|settled]] for about $43,000.<ref name="nyt-obit" />

==== Shooting of Qa'id Walker-Teal ====

On August 22, 1992, in Marin City, Shakur performed outdoors at a festival. For about an hour after the performance, he signed autographs and posed for photos. A conflict broke out and Shakur allegedly drew a legally carried [[Colt Mustang]] but dropped it on the ground. Shakur claimed that someone with him then picked it up when it accidentally discharged.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Marin-slaying-case-against-rapper-opens-3122665.php|title=Marin slaying case against rapper opens |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=November 3, 1995 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412011323/http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Marin-slaying-case-against-rapper-opens-3122665.php |archive-date=April 12, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Settlement in Rapper's Trial for Boy's Death |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=November 8, 1995 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/PAGE-ONE-Settlement-in-Rapper-s-Trial-For-3019996.php |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513061224/http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/PAGE-ONE-Settlement-in-Rapper-s-Trial-For-3019996.php |archive-date=May 13, 2013}}</ref>

About 100 yards (90 meters) away in a schoolyard, Qa'id Walker-Teal, a boy aged 6 on his bicycle, was fatally shot in the forehead. Police matched the bullet to a [[.38 caliber|.38-caliber]] pistol registered to Shakur. His stepbrother Maurice Harding was arrested in suspicion of having fired the gun, but no charges were filed. Lack of witnesses stymied prosecution. In 1995, Qa'id's mother filed a [[Wrongful death claim|wrongful death suit]] against Shakur, which was settled for about $300,000 to $500,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Marin-slaying-case-against-rapper-opens-3122665.php|title=Marin slaying case against rapper opens |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=November 3, 1995 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412011323/http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Marin-slaying-case-against-rapper-opens-3122665.php |archive-date=April 12, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Settlement in Rapper's Trial for Boy's Death |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=November 8, 1995 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/PAGE-ONE-Settlement-in-Rapper-s-Trial-For-3019996.php |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513061224/http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/PAGE-ONE-Settlement-in-Rapper-s-Trial-For-3019996.php |archive-date=May 13, 2013}}</ref>

==== Assault convictions ====
On April 5, 1993, charged with felonious assault, Shakur allegedly threw a microphone and swung a baseball bat at rapper Chauncey Wynn, of the group M.A.D., at a concert at [[Michigan State University]]. On September 14, 1994, Shakur pleaded guilty to a [[misdemeanor]], and was sentenced to 30 days in jail, twenty of them suspended, and ordered to 35 hours of community service.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rapper Tupac Shakur to face assault charge|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&dat=19940909&id=C0xIAAAAIBAJ&pg=4115,3582492|access-date=August 27, 2013|newspaper=Ocala Star-Banner|date=September 9, 1994|archive-date=December 8, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201208044705/https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&dat=19940909&id=C0xIAAAAIBAJ&pg=4115%2C3582492|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Rapper sentenced for assault|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1988&dat=19941101&id=n0AoAAAAIBAJ&pg=3900,36494|access-date=August 27, 2013|newspaper=The Argus|date=November 1, 1994|archive-date=December 8, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201208044720/https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1988&dat=19941101&id=n0AoAAAAIBAJ&pg=3900%2C36494|url-status=live}}</ref>

Slated to star as Sharif in the 1993 [[Hughes Brothers]]' film ''[[Menace II Society]]'', Shakur was replaced by actor Vonte Sweet after allegedly assaulting one of the film's directors, Allen Hughes. In early 1994, Shakur served 15 days in jail after being found guilty of the assault.<ref>Sullivan 2003, p. 80.</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Tupac Shakur Biography |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/tupac-shakur/biography |work=Rolling Stone |access-date=August 27, 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825104437/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/tupac-shakur/biography |archive-date=August 25, 2013}}</ref> The prosecution's evidence included a ''[[Yo!

==== Shooting in Atlanta ====

In October 1993, in [[Atlanta]], Mark Whitwell and Scott Whitwell, two brothers who were both off-duty police officers, were out celebrating with their wives after one of them had passed the state's bar examination. Drunk, the officers were crossing the street when a passing car carrying Shakur allegedly almost struck them. The Whitwells argued with the car's occupants. When a second car arrived, the Whitwells ran away, as Shakur shot one officer in the buttocks and the other in the leg, back, or abdomen.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/02/us/rapper-charged-in-shootings-of-off-duty-officers.html|title=Rapper Charged in Shootings of Off-Duty Officers|date=November 2, 1993|last=Smothers|first=Ronald|work=[[The New York Times]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200917120516/https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/02/us/rapper-charged-in-shootings-of-off-duty-officers.html|archive-date=September 17, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Shakur's Estate Hit With Default Claim Over Shooting|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1433981/19980720/story.jhtml|date=July 20, 1998|publisher=MTV News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020127003340/http://www.mtv.com:80/news/articles/1433981/19980720/story.jhtml|archive-date=January 27, 2002|access-date=July 2, 2021|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Shakur was charged in the shooting. Mark Whitwell was charged with firing at Shakur's car and later with making false statements to investigators. Prosecutors ultimately dropped all charges against both parties. Both brothers filed civil suits against Shakur; Mark Whitwell's was settled out of court, while Scott Whitwell's $2&nbsp;million lawsuit resulted in a default judgment entered against the rapper's estate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/02/us/rapper-charged-in-shootings-of-off-duty-officers.html|title=Rapper Charged in Shootings of Off-Duty Officers|date=November 2, 1993|last=Smothers|first=Ronald|work=[[The New York Times]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200917120516/https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/02/us/rapper-charged-in-shootings-of-off-duty-officers.html|archive-date=September 17, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Shakur's Estate Hit With Default Claim Over Shooting|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1433981/19980720/story.jhtml|date=July 20, 1998|publisher=MTV News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020127003340/http://www.mtv.com:80/news/articles/1433981/19980720/story.jhtml|archive-date=January 27, 2002|access-date=July 2, 2021|url-status=dead}}</ref>
