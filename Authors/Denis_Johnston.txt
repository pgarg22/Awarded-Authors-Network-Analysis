'''(William) Denis Johnston''' (18 June 1901 – 8 August 1984) was an [[Irish ethnicity|Irish]] writer.  Born in [[Dublin]], he wrote mostly plays, but also works of literary criticism, a book-length biographical essay of [[Jonathan Swift]], a memoir and an eccentric work on cosmology and philosophy.  He also worked as a [[war correspondent]], and as both a radio and television producer for the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]].  His first play, ''The Old Lady Says "No!"'', helped establish the worldwide reputation of the Dublin [[Gate Theatre]]; his second, ''The Moon in the Yellow River'', has been performed around the globe in numerous productions featuring such storied names as [[James Mason]], [[Jack Hawkins]], [[Claude Rains]], [[Barry Fitzgerald]], [[James Coco]] and [[Errol Flynn]]. Later plays dealt with the life of Swift, the 1916 Rebellion, the pursuit of justice, and the fear of death. He wrote two opera libretti and a pageant.

==Career==
Johnston was a protégé of [[WB Yeats]] and [[George Bernard Shaw|Shaw]], and had a stormy friendship with [[Seán O'Casey]]. He was a pioneer of television and war reporting. He worked as a lawyer in the 1920s and 1930s before joining the BBC as a writer and producer, first in radio and then in the fledgling television service. His broadcast dramatic work included both original plays and adaptation of the work of many different writers.

During the [[Second World War]] he served as a BBC war correspondent, reporting from [[El Alamein]] to [[Buchenwald]]. For this he was awarded an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]], a [[Mentioned in Despatches|Mention in Despatches]], and the Yugoslav Partisans Medal. He then became Director of Programmes for the television service.

Johnston later moved to the United States and taught at [[Mount Holyoke College]], [[Smith College]] and other universities. He kept extensive diaries throughout his life, now deposited in the [[Trinity College Library, Dublin|Library]] of [[Trinity College, Dublin]], and these together with his many articles and essays give a distinctive picture of his times and the people he knew. Another archive of his work is held at the library of [[Ulster University at Coleraine]]. He received honorary degrees from the [[University of Ulster]] and [[Mount Holyoke College]] and was a member of [[Aosdána]].

Denis and actress [[Shelah Richards]] were the parents of [[Jennifer Johnston]], a respected novelist and playwright, and a son, Michael.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/a-shaper-of-sophisticated-stories-1.1266817 |title=A shaper of sophisticated stories |publisher=Irishtimes.com |date=2010-01-09 |accessdate=2016-07-16}}</ref> His second wife was the actress [[Betty Chancellor]], with whom he had two sons, Jeremy and Rory.<ref name="Clarke">{{cite book |last1=Clarke|first1=Frances|editor1-last=McGuire |editor1-first=James |editor2-last=Quinn |editor2-first=James |title=Dictionary of Irish Biography |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |chapter=Chancellor, (Lilias) Betty}}</ref>

==Critical acclaim==

[[File:Denis_Johnston_1930.jpg|thumb|right|Denis Johnston c. 1930]]
[[Hilton Edwards]], who first directed ''The Old Lady Says "No!"'', said that the script "read like a railway guide and played like ''Tristan and Isolde''."<ref>Ronsley, Joseph, ed., ''Denis Johnston: a retrospective.'' Irish Literary Studies No. 8, Colin Smythe, Barnes & Noble Books, 1981, p. 5</ref>

Reviewing ''The Moon in the Yellow River'' in ''[[The New York Times]]'',  [[Brooks Atkinson]] wrote "Mr Johnston does not explain; he irradiates."<ref>{{cite news |work=The New York Times |title=The Moon in the Yellow River |date=13 March 1932 |p=sec. 8 p.1}}</ref>  Set in 1927 during an attempt by the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] to destroy an [[Irish Free State]] government power plant, a later ''New York Times'' review of the play's 1961 revival noted an "exhilaratingly mad, comic strain.".<ref>Howard Taubman, "The Theatre: Irish Irony; Johnston's 'Moon in the Yellow River' Revived." ''New York Times.'' February 7, 1961</ref> But acclaim was not universal. Irish writer and broadcaster (and later member of the [[Seanad Eireann|Irish Senate]]) [[Denis Ireland]] remarked that the play's success in London was "natural enough" for "it fulfils the first law of [[Anglo-Irish people|Anglo-Irish]] literature: it makes the native Irish appear a race of congenital idiots."<ref>Denis Ireland (1936) ''From the Irish Shore: Notes on My Life and Times'' (London Rich & Cowan). p. 209</ref>

Johnston's war memoir ''Nine Rivers from Jordan'' reached The New York Times' Best Seller list and was cited in the [[World Book Encyclopedia]]'s 1950s article on World War II under "Books to Read", along with Churchill, Eisenhower et al.<ref>World Book Encyclopedia, Field Enterprises Educational Corporation, 1959, Vol. 18 p. 8927</ref> Joseph Ronsley cites an unnamed former CBS Viet Nam correspondent who called the book the "Bible", carrying it with him constantly, "reading it over and over in the field during his tour of duty."<ref>Ronsley op. cit., p. vii</ref>

In a profile in the [[The New Yorker|New Yorker]] in 1938, [[Clifford Odets]] is quoted as saying that the only playwrights he admired were [[John Howard Lawson]], Sean O’Casey, and Denis Johnston.<ref>New Yorker Jan. 22 1938 p. 27</ref>

Johnston's tribute to Dublin, "Strumpet city in the sunset," from the closing speech of ''The Old Lady says "No!"'', has achieved its own fame. [[James Plunkett]] titled his epic novel of Dublin before the First World War ''[[Strumpet City]]''. And a travel guide written by Harvard students in introducing Dublin made a classic misattribution: "James Joyce loved his 'Strumpet city in the sunset'."<ref>''Let’s Go Britain and Ireland''. E.P. Dutton 1978</ref>

The Denis Johnston Playwriting Prize is awarded annually by [[Smith College]] Department of Theatre for the best play, screenplay or musical written by an undergraduate at Smith, Mount Holyoke, Amherst and Hampshire Colleges and the University of Massachusetts Amherst. The prize was endowed by his former student at Smith, [[Carol Sobieski]].
