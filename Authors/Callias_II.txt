'''Callias''' ({{lang-gr|Καλλίας|Kallias}}) was an [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] statesman, soldier and diplomat, active in 5th century BC. He is commonly known as Callias II to distinguish him from his grandfather, Callias I, and from his grandson, [[Callias III]], who apparently squandered the family's fortune.<ref name="Storey-180">{{in lang|en}} {{cite book |author1=Ian Christopher Storey |author-link=Ian Christopher Storey |title=Eupolis: Poet of Old Comedy |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford |isbn=9780199259922 |page=180 }}</ref>

Born to the wealthy [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] family which provided [[slavery in ancient Greece|slaves]] to the state-owned [[silver mine]] of [[Laurion]], he was one of the richest men in Athens.<ref name="Sacks-177">{{in lang|en}} {{cite book |author1=David Sacks |author-link=David Sacks |author2=Oswyn Murray |author2-link=Oswyn Murray |editor=Lisa R.

Callias is said to have killed the man and secretly taken the treasure, though afterward rumor spread of the incident and comic poets gave his family the name ''Laccopluti'', or "enriched by the ditch." His son, [[Hipponicus]], was a military commander.

Around the time of the death of [[Miltiades]], Callias offered to pay the debt [[Cimon]] had inherited from his father in exchange for Cimon's sister [[Elpinice|Elpinice's]] hand in marriage and Cimon agreed.

A supporter of [[Pericles]], who was the effective leader of  Athens during this period, Callias took on the role of  diplomat and ambassador for Athens and the [[Delian League]].<ref name="Sacks-177"/> In about 461 BC he made at least one journey as ambassador to the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]]n king [[Artaxerxes I of Persia|Artaxerxes I]].<ref name="Sacks-177"/>

Callias' fate upon his return to Athens remains a mystery and information about his later years remain only fragmentary. Some sources{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} allege that his mission to Artaxerxes does not seem to have been successful and that he was indicted for [[high treason]] on his return to Athens and sentenced to a fine of fifty [[Talent (weight)|talents]].<ref name="EB1911"/> Others claim,<ref name="Dillon-402"/> that the Athenians dedicated an altar of peace and voted special honours to Callias.

Callias' son [[Hipponicus III|Hipponicus]] was also a notable military leader, and was to become known as the "richest man in Greece".<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=The People of Plato, p. 172-3|last=Nails|first=Debra}}</ref>
