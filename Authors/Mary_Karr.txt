== Career ==
=== Memoirs ===
Karr's [[memoir]] ''[[The Liars' Club]]'', published in 1995, was a ''[[New York Times]]'' bestseller for over a year, and was named one of the year's best books. It explores her deeply troubled childhood, most of which was spent in a gritty industrial section of Southeast Texas in the 1960s. She was encouraged to write her personal history by her friend [[Tobias Wolff]], but has said she only took up the project when her marriage fell apart.<ref>[http://www.salonmagazine.com/may97/karr970521.html Salon Magazine Interview, May, 1997] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724064644/http://www.salonmagazine.com/may97/karr970521.html |date=July 24, 2008 }}</ref>

She followed the book with a second memoir, ''Cherry'' (2000), about her late adolescence and early womanhood.<ref>{{cite book|title=Cherry : a Memoir by the Author of The Liars' Club|date=2000|publisher=The Penguin Group, Penguin Putnam Inc|isbn=9780670892747|oclc=779617706}}</ref>

A third memoir, ''Lit: A Memoir'', which she says details "my journey from blackbelt sinner and lifelong agnostic to unlikely Catholic,"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/07/06/stray-questions-for-mary-karr/|title=Stray Questions for: Mary Karr|last=Times|first=The New York|work=ArtsBeat|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en}} {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507000545/https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com//2007/07/06/stray-questions-for-mary-karr/ |date=May 7, 2011 }}</ref> came out in November 2009. The memoir describes Karr's time as an alcoholic and the salvation she found in her conversion to Catholicism. She describes herself as a [[cafeteria Catholic]].<ref name="Berkley">Edelstein, Wendy (2006-02-15). [http://berkeley.edu/news/berkeleyan/2006/02/15_karr.shtml "An Improbable Catholic"]. UC Berkeley News. Retrieved 2010-2-08.</ref>

=== Poetry ===
Karr won a 1989 [[Whiting Awards|Whiting Award]] for her poetry. She was a [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggenheim Fellow]] in poetry in 2005 and has won [[Pushcart Prize|Pushcart prizes]] for both her poetry and essays. Karr has published five volumes of poetry: ''Abacus'' (Wesleyan University Press, CT, 1987, in its New Poets series), ''The Devil's Tour'' ([[New Directions Publishing|New Directions]] NY, 1993, an original TPB), ''Viper Rum'' ([[New Directions Publishing|New Directions]] NY, 1998, an original TPB), ''Sinners Welcome'' ([[HarperCollins]], NY, 2006), and ''Tropic of Squalor'' ([[Harper Collins]], NY, 2018). Her poems have appeared in major literary magazines such as ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'', ''[[The New Yorker]]'', and ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/mary-karr#tab-poems|title=Mary Karr|date=2018-03-13|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|others=Poetry Foundation|access-date=2018-04-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/mary-karr|title=Mary Karr|date=2018-03-13|magazine=The New Yorker|language=en-us|others=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-04-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/author/mary-karr/|title=Mary Karr|date=2018-03-13|website=The Atlantic|language=en-us|others=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-04-28}}</ref>

Karr's Pushcart Award-winning essay, "Against Decoration", was originally published in the quarterly review ''[[Parnassus (magazine)|Parnassus]]'' (1991) and later reprinted in ''Viper Rum''. In "Against Decoration", Karr took a stand in favor of content over poetic style. She argued emotions need to be directly expressed and clarity should be a watch-word: characters are too obscure, the presented physical world is often "foggy" (that is imprecise), references are "showy" (both non-germane and overused), metaphors overshadow expected meaning, and techniques of language (polysyllables, archaic words, intricate syntax, "yards of adjectives") only "slow a reader's understanding".

Another essay, "Facing Altars: Poetry and Prayer", was originally published in ''Poetry'' (2005). Karr tells of moving from agnostic alcoholic to baptized Catholic of the decidedly "cafeteria" kind, yet one who prays twice daily with loud fervor from her "foxhole". In this essay, Karr argues that poetry and prayer arise from the same sources within us.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Facing Altars: Poetry and Prayer|journal=Poetry|date=2005|volume=187|issue=2|pages=125–136|jstor=20607202|last1=Karr|first1=Mary}}</ref>

== Personal life ==
Karr was born in [[Groves, Texas]], on January 16, 1955, and lived there until she moved to [[Los Angeles]] in 1972. That same year, Karr started at [[Macalester College]] in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul, Minnesota]], where she studied for two years and met poet [[Etheridge Knight]], one of her first mentors.<ref name="Almon">Almon, Bert.

Karr was married to poet Michael Milburn for 13 years.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} At some point, she had a relationship with author [[David Foster Wallace]]. Karr spoke out about Wallace's abusive behaviour, which included years of stalking, throwing a coffee table at her, and harassing her five-year-old son.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/05/the-world-still-spins-around-male-genius/559925/|title = David Foster Wallace and the Dangerous Romance of Male Genius|date = May 9, 2018}}</ref>

Although a convert to [[Catholicism]], Karr supports views that are at odds with Catholic Church teaching: on abortion she is [[pro-choice]], and she has spoken in favor of [[Catholic Church doctrine on the ordination of women|women's ordination]] to the priesthood. Karr has described herself as a [[feminist]] since age 12.<ref name="Berkley"/>
