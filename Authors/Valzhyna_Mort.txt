'''Valzhyna Mort''' (born '''Valhyna Martynava''',<ref>[http://www.provocate.org/march-27-%E2%80%94-belarusian-poet-valzhyna-mort-returns/ ]{{dead link|date=April 2020}}</ref> 1981, [[Minsk]], [[Belarus]]) is a [[Belarusian people|Belarusian]] [[poet]] who now lives in the United States.

==Life==
Her first book of poetry, ''I'm as Thin as Your Eyelashes'', came out in Belarus in 2005. In 2004, she received a Crystal Vilencia Award for best poetry performance in Slovenia. In 2005, she was the recipient of a Gaude Polonia scholarship in Poland, and in 2006, the recipient of a writing fellowship from Literarisches Colloquium Berlin, Germany.<ref>[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/valzhyna-mort "Valzhyna Mort"], Poetry Foundation.</ref>

Her first American publication, ''Factory of Tears'' ([[Copper Canyon Press]], 2008), the first Belarusian/English poetry published in the U.S., was co-translated from the Belarusian by [[Elizabeth Oehlkers Wright]] and [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning poet [[Franz Wright]]. The poems juxtapose youthful coming-of-age to the struggles of a nation’s emergent vitality. ''Collected Body'' ([[Copper Canyon Press]], 2011) is her most recent book of poetry and her first collection of poems composed entirely in English.

Mort studied at the State University of Linguistics in Minsk. She received her Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing from [[American University]]. Known throughout Europe for her live performances, Mort works explicitly to reestablish a clear identity for Belarus and its language.<ref>''New Yorker'', May 19, 2008.</ref> Mort is the youngest poet to be featured on the cover of ''Poets & Writers magazine''.<ref>Kevin Nance (2008).
