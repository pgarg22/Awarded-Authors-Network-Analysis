'''Mihály Csokonai''' (full name '''Mihály Csokonai Vitéz'''; in Hungarian '''Csokonai Mihály''' or '''Csokonai Vitéz Mihály''') ({{IPA-hu|ˈt͡ʃokonɒi ˈviteːz ˈmihaːj|lang}}) (17 November 1773 – 28 January 1805)<ref>The Encyclopædia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, and General Literature, Volume 12 -PAGE: 392 , published in 1894</ref> was a [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] [[poet]], a leading figure in the Hungarian literary revival of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].

Having been educated in [[Debrecen]], where he was born, Csokonai was appointed while still very young to the professorship of poetry there. Shortly thereafter he was deprived of the post on account of the immorality of his conduct.

The remaining twelve years of his short life were passed in almost constant wretchedness, and he died in his native town, in his mother's house, when only thirty-one years of age.

Csokonai was a genial and original poet, with something of the lyrical fire of [[Sándor Petőfi]], and wrote a mock-heroic poem called ''Dorottya'' or the ''Triumph of the Ladies at the Carnival'', two or three comedies or farces, and a number of love-poems. Most of his works have been published by Schedel (1844–1847).
