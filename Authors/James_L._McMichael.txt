McMichael is a Professor Emeritus in the English department under the School of Humanities at the [[University of California, Irvine]].<ref name=nat/>

"McMichael writes densely; his language is compacted, coiled, sprung (in [[Gerard Manley Hopkins|Hopkins]]'s sense) and highly allusive. It is never simple or straightforward," writes Liz Rozenberg in a ''[[Boston Globe]]'' review.<ref name=ros>{{cite news|last=Rosenberg|first=Liz|title=In the year's most honored poetry, language reinvented|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2006/12/03/in_the_years_most_honored_poetry_language_reinvented/|accessdate=October 18, 2012|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=December 3, 2006}}</ref>

Eric McHenry, in a brief review of ''Capacity'' in ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote: "Since 1980, his [McMichael's] sole contributions to the genre (excluding a "new and selected") have been three book-length poems, each strikingly different from the others and from anything else on the market. In ''Capacity'', he has exchanged the long lines and explicit autobiography of the previous two for dispassion, elision and lines as short as a syllable."<ref name=eric>{{cite news|last=McHenry|first=Eric|title=Poetry Chronicle|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/23/books/review/23mchen.html?ei=5070&en=60b5b9562b2815b5&ex=1166418000&pagewanted=print|accessdate=October 18, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 23, 2006}}</ref>
