==Early life==
Zola was born in Paris in 1840 to [[François Zola]] (originally Francesco Zolla) and Émilie Aubert. His father was an Italian engineer with some [[Greeks|Greek]] ancestry,<ref name="EB1911">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Zola, Émile Édouard Charles Antoine|volume=28|page=1001|first=Frank Thomas|last=Marzials}}</ref> who was born in [[Venice]] in 1795, and engineered the [[Zola Dam]] in [[Aix-en-Provence]]; his mother was French.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sacquin |first1=Michèle |last2=Cabannes |first2=Viviane |title=Zola et autour d'une oeuvre : Au bonheur des dames |date=2002 |publisher=Bibliothèque nationale de France |isbn=9782717722161 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=avqRAAAAIAAJ}}</ref> The family moved to Aix-en-Provence in the [[Provence|southeast]] when Émile was three years old. Four years later, in 1847, his father died, leaving his mother on a meager pension. In 1858, the Zolas moved to Paris, where Émile's childhood friend [[Paul Cézanne]] soon joined him. Zola started to write in the [[Romanticism|romantic]] style. His widowed mother had planned a law career for Émile, but he failed his [[baccalauréat]] examination twice.<ref name="nom">[[Éditions Larousse|Larousse]], [http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/personnage/Zola/150676 ''Émile Zola'']</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Berg |first=William J. |date=24 September 2020 |title=Émile Zola {{!}} French author|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Emile-Zola|access-date=2020-11-09|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref>

Before his breakthrough as a writer, Zola worked for minimal pay as a clerk in a shipping firm and then in the sales department for the publisher [[Louis Christophe François Hachette|Hachette]].<ref name=":0" /> He also wrote literary and art reviews for newspapers. As a political journalist, Zola did not hide his dislike of [[Napoleon III]], who had successfully run for the office of president under the constitution of the [[French Second Republic]], only to use this position as a springboard for the [[French coup d'état of 1851|coup d'état that made him emperor]].

==Later life==
In 1862 Zola was naturalized as a French citizen.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Anonym |title=Church opponent of Italian descent ..

The marriage remained childless. Alexandrine Zola had a child before she met Zola that she had given up, because she was unable to take care of it. When she confessed this to Zola after their marriage, they went looking for the girl, but she had died a short time after birth.

In 1888, he was given a camera, but he only began to use it in 1895 and attained a near professional level of expertise.<ref>{{Cite news |title=IN LATER YEARS, ZOLA SAW WORLD THROUGH A CAMERA |last=August |first=Marilyn |date=14 December 2000 |work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |page=F-8 |via=ProQuest}}</ref> Also in 1888, Alexandrine hired Jeanne Rozerot, a seamstress who was to live with them in their home in [[Médan]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=Frederick |title=Zola: A Life |year=1995 |publisher=Farrar Straus Giroux |isbn=0374297428 |pages=614, 615}}</ref> Zola fell in love with Jeanne and fathered two children with her: Denise in 1889 and Jacques in 1891.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=Frederick |title=Zola: A Life |year=1995 |publisher=Farrar Straus Giroux |isbn=0374297428 |pages=646–648}}</ref> After Jeanne left Médan for Paris, Zola continued to support and visit her and their children.

==Career==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}
[[File:Émile Zola by Carjat.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Zola early in his career]]

During his early years, Zola wrote numerous short stories and essays, four plays, and three novels. Among his early books was ''Contes à Ninon'', published in 1864.<ref name="EB1911"/> With the publication of his sordid autobiographical novel ''La Confession de Claude'' (1865) attracting police attention, Hachette fired Zola. His novel ''Les Mystères de Marseille'' appeared as a serial in 1867. He was also an aggressive critic, his articles on literature and art appearing in [[Hippolyte de Villemessant|Villemessant's]] journal ''L'Événement''.<ref name="EB1911"/> After his first major novel, ''[[Thérèse Raquin]]'' (1867), Zola started the series called [[Les Rougon-Macquart]].

In Paris, Zola maintained his friendship with [[Cézanne]], who painted a portrait of him with another friend from Aix-en-Provence, writer [[Paul Alexis]], entitled ''Paul Alexis Reading to Zola''.

===Literary output===
[[Image:Paul Cézanne - Paul Alexis Lê um Manuscrito a Zola.jpg|thumb|right|[[Paul Cézanne]], ''[[Paul Alexis]] Reading to Émile Zola'', 1869–1870, [[São Paulo Museum of Art]]]]
More than half of Zola's novels were part of the twenty-volume [[Les Rougon-Macquart]] cycle, which details the history of a single family under the reign of Napoléon III. Unlike [[Honoré de Balzac|Balzac]], who in the midst of his literary career resynthesized his work into ''[[La Comédie Humaine]]'', Zola from the start, at the age of 28, had thought of the complete layout of the series.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Set in France's [[Second Empire (France)|Second Empire]], in the context of [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris|Baron Haussmann's changing Paris]], the series traces the environmental and hereditary influences of violence, alcohol, and prostitution which became more prevalent during the second wave of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The series examines two branches of the family—the respectable (that is, legitimate) Rougons and the disreputable (illegitimate) Macquarts—over five generations.

In the preface to the first novel of the series, Zola states, "I want to explain how a family, a small group of regular people, behaves in society, while expanding through the birth of ten, twenty individuals, who seem at first glance profoundly dissimilar, but who are shown through analysis to be intimately linked to one another. Heredity has its own laws, just like gravity. I will attempt to find and to follow, by resolving the double question of temperaments and environments, the thread that leads mathematically from one man to another."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Zola |first=Émile |title=La Fortune des Rougon |publisher=Gallimard |year=1981 |isbn= |location=Paris, France |pages=27}}</ref>

Although Zola and Cézanne were friends from childhood, they experienced a falling out later in life over Zola's fictionalised depiction of Cézanne and the [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] life of painters in Zola's novel ''[[L'Œuvre]]'' (''The Masterpiece'', 1886).

From 1877, with the publication of ''[[L'Assommoir]]'', Émile Zola became wealthy; he was better paid than [[Victor Hugo]], for example.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Zola |first=Émile |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4FDCvwEACAAJ |title=The Three Cities Trilogy Complete: Lourdes, Rome and Paris |date=2005 |publisher=Library of Alexandria |isbn=978-1-4655-2672-4 |language=en}}</ref> Because ''L'Assommoir'' was such a success, Zola was able to renegotiate his contract with his publisher Georges Charpentier to receive more than 14% royalties and the exclusive rights to serial publication in the press.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Books : a living history |last=Martyn |first=Lyons |date=2011 |publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum |isbn=9781606060834 |location=Los Angeles |pages=143 |oclc=707023033}}</ref> Subsequently, sales of ''L'Assommoir'' were even exceeded by those of [[Nana (novel)|Nana]] (1880) and ''La Débâcle'' (1892).<ref name="EB1911"/> He became a figurehead among the literary bourgeoisie and organised cultural dinners with [[Guy de Maupassant]], [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]], and other writers at his luxurious villa (worth 300,000 francs)<ref>{{cite journal |title=Literary gossip |journal=The Week : A Canadian Journal of Politics, Literature, Science and Arts |date=27 December 1883 |volume=1 |issue=4 |page=61 |url=https://archive.org/stream/weekcanadianjour01toro#page/n30/mode/1up|access-date=23 April 2013}}</ref> in Médan, near Paris, after 1880. Despite being nominated several times, Zola was never elected to the {{lang|fr|[[Académie française]]}}.<ref name="EB1911"/>

Zola's output also included novels on population (''Fécondité'') and work (''Travail''), a number of plays, and several volumes of criticism. He wrote every day for around 30 years, and took as his motto {{lang|la|Nulla dies sine linea}} ("not a day without a line").

The self-proclaimed leader of French naturalism, Zola's works inspired operas such as those of [[Gustave Charpentier]], notably ''[[Louise (opera)|Louise]]'' in the 1890s. His works, inspired by the concept of [[heredity]] and milieu ([[Claude Bernard]] and [[Hippolyte Taine]])<ref>{{Citation |last=Zola |first=Émile |title=Le Roman expérimental |date=1902 |url=https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Le_Roman_exp%C3%A9rimental |pages=1–53 |publisher=Paris : Charpentier|access-date=2021-01-07}}</ref> and by the realism of Balzac and Flaubert.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Mitterand |first=Henri |title=Zola et le naturalisme |publisher=Presses universitaires de France |year=1986 |isbn= |location= |pages=}}</ref> He also provided the libretto for several operas by [[Alfred Bruneau]], including ''[[Messidor (opera)|Messidor]]'' (1897) and ''[[L'Ouragan (opera)|L'Ouragan]]'' (1901); several of Bruneau's other operas are adapted from Zola's writing. These provided a French alternative to Italian [[verismo]].<ref>{{Cite Grove |title=Zola, Emile |author=Richard Langham Smith |url=https://doi.org/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.O004671}}</ref>

He is considered to be a significant influence on those writers that are credited with the creation of the so-called [[new journalism]]; Wolfe, Capote, Thompson, Mailer, Didion, Talese and others.
[[Tom Wolfe]] wrote that his goal in writing fiction was to document contemporary society in the tradition of John Steinbeck, Charles Dickens, and Émile Zola.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

==Dreyfus affair==
{{Main|Dreyfus affair|J'accuse}}
[[File:J’accuse.jpg|thumb|Front page cover of the newspaper ''L'Aurore'' for Thursday 13 January 1898, with the open letter ''[[J'Accuse…!]]'', written by Émile Zola about the [[Dreyfus affair]]. The headline reads "I Accuse...! Letter to the President of the Republic"—Paris [[Musée d'Art et d'Histoire du Judaïsme|Museum of Jewish Art and History]]]]

Captain [[Alfred Dreyfus]] was a French-Jewish artillery officer in the French army. In September 1894, French intelligence found information about someone giving the German Embassy military secrets. Anti-semitism caused senior officers to suspect Dreyfus, though there was no direct evidence of any wrongdoing. Dreyfus was court-martialed, convicted of treason, and sent to [[Devil's Island]] in French Guiana.

Lt. Col. [[Georges Picquart]] came across evidence that implicated another officer, [[Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy]], and informed his superiors. Rather than move to clear Dreyfus, the decision was made to protect Esterhazy and ensure the original verdict was not overturned. Major [[Hubert-Joseph Henry]] forged documents that made it seem as if Dreyfus were guilty, while Picquart was reassigned to duty in Africa. However, Picquart's findings were communicated by his lawyer to the Senator [[Auguste Scheurer-Kestner]], who took up the case, at first discreetly and then increasingly publicly. Meanwhile, further evidence was brought forward by Dreyfus's family and Esterhazy's estranged family and creditors. Under pressure, the general staff arranged for a closed court-martial to be held on 10–11 January 1898, at which Esterhazy was tried ''in camera'' and acquitted. Picquart was detained on charges of violation of professional secrecy.

In response Zola risked his career and more, and on 13 January 1898 published ''[[J'Accuse…!]]''<ref>[//en.wikisource.org/wiki/J'accuse...!?match=fr J'accuse letter] at French [[wikisource]]</ref> on the front page of the Paris daily ''[[L'Aurore]]''. The newspaper was run by Ernest Vaughan and [[Georges Clemenceau]], who decided that the controversial story would be in the form of an [[open letter]] to the President, [[Félix Faure]]. Zola's ''J'Accuse...!'' accused the highest levels of the French Army of obstruction of justice and [[antisemitism]] by having wrongfully convicted Alfred Dreyfus to life imprisonment on Devil's Island. Zola's intention was that he be prosecuted for libel so that the new evidence in support of Dreyfus would be made public.<ref>{{cite web |title=Correspondence Between Emile Zola and Imprisoned Alfred Dreyfus |url=http://www.shapell.org/manuscript.aspx?170038 |publisher=Shapell Manuscript Foundation}}</ref> The case, known as the Dreyfus affair, deeply divided France between the reactionary army and Catholic church on one hand, and the more liberal commercial society on the other. The ramifications continued for many years; on the 100th anniversary of Zola's article, France's [[Roman Catholic]] daily paper, ''[[La Croix]]'', apologised for its [[antisemitic]] editorials during the Dreyfus affair.<ref>{{cite news |title=World News Briefs; French Paper Apologizes For Slurs on Dreyfus |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/13/world/world-news-briefs-french-paper-apologizes-for-slurs-on-dreyfus.html |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=13 January 1998 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=25 March 2018}}</ref> As Zola was a leading French thinker and public figure, his letter formed a major turning point in the affair.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Zola was brought to trial for criminal libel on 7 February 1898, and was convicted on 23 February and removed from the [[Légion d'honneur|Legion of Honour]]. The first judgment was overturned in April on a technicality, but a new suit was pressed against Zola, which opened on 18 July. At his lawyer's advice, Zola fled to England rather than wait for the end of the trial (at which he was again convicted). Without even having had the time to pack a few clothes, he arrived at [[London Victoria station|Victoria Station]] on 19 July, the start of a brief and unhappy residence in the UK. After initially staying at the Grosvenor Hotel, Victoria, Zola then went to the Oatlands Park Hotel in Weybridge and shortly afterwards rented a house locally called Penn where he was joined by his family for the summer. At the end of August, they moved to another house in Addlestone called Summerfield. In early October the family moved to London and then his wife and children went back to France so the children could resume their schooling. Thereafter Zola lived alone in the Queen's Hotel, Norwood.<ref>[https://www.weybridgesociety.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Newsletter-Spring-2019.pdf Weybridge Society Newsletter Spring 2019]</ref> He stayed in Upper Norwood from October 1898 to June 1899.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In France, the furious divisions over the Dreyfus affair continued. The fact of Major Henry's forgery was discovered and admitted to in August 1898, and the Government referred Dreyfus's original court-martial to the Supreme Court for review the following month, over the objections of the General Staff. Eight months later, on 3 June 1899, the Supreme Court annulled the original verdict and ordered a new military court-martial. The same month Zola returned from his exile in England. Still the anti-Dreyfusards would not give up, and on 8 September 1899 Dreyfus was again convicted. Dreyfus applied for a retrial, but the government countered by offering Dreyfus a pardon (rather than exoneration), which would allow him to go free, provided that he admit to being guilty. Although he was clearly not guilty, he chose to accept the pardon. Later the same month, despite Zola's condemnation, an amnesty bill was passed, covering "all criminal acts or misdemeanours related to the Dreyfus affair or that have been included in a prosecution for one of these acts", indemnifying Zola and Picquart, but also all those who had concocted evidence against Dreyfus. Dreyfus was finally completely exonerated by the Supreme Court in 1906.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hZqpCrG3qw0C&q=In+1906%2C+Dreyfus+was+completely+exonerated+by+the+Supreme+Court.&pg=PA117 |title=The New Jewish Encyclopedia |last1=Bridger |first1=David |last2=Wolk |first2=Samuel |date=1 January 1976 |publisher=Behrman House, Inc |isbn=978-0874411201 |pages=111 |language=en}}</ref>

Zola said of the affair, "The truth is on the march, and nothing shall stop it."<ref>Wikisource, [[s:J'accuse...!|I Accuse....! (English)]] URL: http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/J'accuse...!</ref> 
Zola's 1898 article is widely marked in France as the most prominent manifestation of the new power of the intellectuals (writers, artists, academicians) in shaping [[public opinion]], the media and the state.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

== The Manifesto of the Five ==
On August 18, 1887, the French daily newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'' published "The Manifesto of the Five" shortly after ''[[La Terre]]'' was released. The signatories included Paul Bonnetain, J. H. Rosny, [[Lucien Descaves]], [[Paul Margueritte]] and Gustave Guiches, who strongly disapproved of the lack of balance of both morals and aesthetics throughout the book's depiction of the revolution. The manifesto accused Zola of having "lowered the standard of Naturalism, of catering to large sales by deliberate obscenities, of being a morbid and impotent hypochondriac, incapable of taking a sane and healthy view of mankind. They freely referred to Zola's physiological weaknesses and expressed the utmost horror at the crudeness of La Terre."<ref>{{Cite news |last=Boyd |first=Ernest |date=2013-08-19 |title=From the Stacks: "Realism in France" |work=The New Republic |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/114374/french-realism-balzac-flaubert-zola-and-romanticisms-remains|access-date=2020-11-25 |issn=0028-6583}}</ref>

A sequel, {{lang|fr|Justice}}, had been planned, but was not completed.

His enemies were blamed for his death because of previous attempts on his life, but nothing could be proved at the time.

Zola was initially buried in the [[Cimetière de Montmartre]] in Paris, but on 4 June 1908, just five years and nine months after his death, his remains were relocated to the [[Panthéon, Paris|Panthéon]], where he shares a crypt with [[Victor Hugo]] and [[Alexandre Dumas (père)|Alexandre Dumas]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parisphotogallery.com/Paris/photos/monuments/Pantheon/Interior_crypt_Victor_Hugo_Alexandre_Dumas_Emile_Zola_10526.htm |title=Paris Monuments Panthéon-Close up picture of the interior of the crypt of Victor Hugo (left) Alexandre Dumas (middle) Emile Zola (right) |publisher=ParisPhotoGallery|access-date=30 January 2012}}</ref> The ceremony was disrupted by an assassination attempt by [[Louis-Anthelme Grégori]], a disgruntled journalist and admirer of [[Edouard Drumont]], on [[Alfred Dreyfus]], who was wounded in the arm by the gunshot.

In 1953, an investigation ("''Zola a-t-il été assassiné?''") published by the journalist Jean Bedel in the newspaper ''[[Libération (newspaper, 1941-1964)|Libération]]'' raised the idea that Zola's death might have been a murder rather than an accident.<ref name=LT>{{cite news |last=Mounier-Kuhn |first=Angélique |title=L'asphyxie d'Émile Zola |work=[[Le Temps]] |date=8 August 2014 |pages=8–9 |language=fr}}</ref> It is based on the revelation of the Norman pharmacist Pierre Hacquin, who was told by the chimney-sweep Henri Buronfosse that the latter intentionally blocked the chimney of Zola's apartment in Paris ("''Hacquin, je vais vous dire comment Zola est mort.

==Scope of the Rougon-Macquart series==
Zola's [[Les Rougon-Macquart|Rougon-Macquart]] novels are a panoramic account of the [[Second French Empire]]. They tell the story of a family approximately between the years 1851 and 1871. These twenty novels contain over 300 characters, who descend from the two family lines of the Rougons and Macquarts. In Zola's words, which are the subtitle of the Rougon-Macquart series, they are ''"L'Histoire naturelle et sociale d'une famille sous le Second Empire" ("The natural and social history of a family under the Second Empire").<ref name="Daily Telegraph 5 December 2015">{{cite news |last=Cummins |first=Anthony |title=How Émile Zola made novels out of gutter voices and ultra-violence |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/what-to-read/how-emile-zola-made-novels-out-of-gutter-voices-and-ultra-violenc/ |date=5 December 2015 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London|access-date=3 November 2016}}</ref><ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica">{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Rougon-Macquart-cycle |title=Rougon-Macquart cycle: Work by Zola |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]]|access-date=3 November 2016}}</ref>''

Most of the Rougon-Macquart novels were written during the [[French Third Republic]]. To an extent, attitudes and value judgments may have been superimposed on that picture with the wisdom of hindsight. Some critics classify Zola's work, and naturalism more broadly, as a particular strain of decadent literature, which emphasized the fallen, corrupted state of modern civilization.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Bernheimer |first=Charles |title=Unknowing Decadence |work=Perennial Decay: On the Aesthetics and Politics of Decadence |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=1999 |isbn=|editor-last=Constable|editor-first=Liz |location=Philadelphia |pages=50–64}}</ref> Nowhere is the doom-laden image of the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]] so clearly seen as in ''[[Nana (novel)|Nana]]'', which culminates in echoes of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (and hence by implication of the French defeat).<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2kdK-qPMBbAC&q=zola+nana+french+defeat&pg=PA135 |title=The Cambridge Companion to Zola |last=Nelson |first=Brian |date=15 February 2007 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781139827270 |language=en}}</ref> Even in novels dealing with earlier periods of Napoleon III's reign the picture of the Second Empire is sometimes overlaid with the imagery of catastrophe.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

[[File:Gil_Blas_-_Germinal.jpg |thumb|right|Poster by [[Léon Choubrac]] advertising the publication of Zola's novel ''[[Germinal (novel)|Germinal]]'' in ''[[Gil Blas]]'', 25 November 1878]]
In the Rougon-Macquart novels, provincial life can seem to be overshadowed by Zola's preoccupation with the capital.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}. However, the following novels (see the individual titles in the Livre de poche series) scarcely touch on life in Paris: ''[[La Terre]]'' (peasant life in Beauce), ''[[Le Rêve (novel)|Le Rêve]]'' (an unnamed cathedral city), ''[[Germinal (novel)|Germinal]]'' (collieries in the northeast of France), ''[[La Joie de vivre]]'' (the Atlantic coast), and the four novels set in and around Plassans (modelled on his childhood home, Aix-en-Provence), (''[[La Fortune des Rougon]]'', ''[[La Conquête de Plassans]]'', ''[[La Faute de l'Abbé Mouret]]'' and ''[[Le Docteur Pascal]]''){{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}. ''[[La Débâcle]]'', the military novel is set for the most part in country districts of eastern France; its dénouement takes place in the capital during the civil war leading to the suppression of the [[Paris Commune]]. Though Paris has its role in ''La Bête humaine'' the most striking incidents (notably the train crash) take place elsewhere. Even the Paris-centred novels tend to set some scenes outside, if not very far from, the capital. In the political novel ''[[Son Excellence Eugène Rougon]]'', the eponymous minister's interventions on behalf of his so-called friends, have their consequences elsewhere, and the reader is witness to some of them. Even Nana, one of Zola's characters most strongly associated with Paris, makes a brief and typically disastrous trip to the country.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Zola |first=Émile |title=Nana |publisher=Livre de poche |year=2003 |isbn=978-2253003656 |location=Paris, France |pages=}}</ref>

==Quasi-scientific purpose==
In ''Le Roman expérimental'' and ''Les Romanciers naturalistes,'' Zola expounded the purposes of the "naturalist" novel. The experimental novel was to serve as a vehicle for scientific experiment, analogous to the experiments conducted by [[Claude Bernard]] and expounded by him in ''Introduction à la médecine expérimentale''. Claude Bernard's experiments were in the field of clinical [[physiology]], those of the Naturalist writers (Zola being their leader) would be in the realm of [[psychology]] influenced by the natural environment.<ref name="nom"/> [[Balzac]], Zola claimed, had already investigated the psychology of lechery in an experimental manner, in the figure of Hector Hulot in ''[[La Cousine Bette]]''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Essential to Zola's concept of the experimental novel was dispassionate observation of the world, with all that it involved by way of meticulous documentation. To him, each novel should be based upon a dossier.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}With this aim, he visited the colliery of [[Anzin]] in northern France, in February 1884 when a strike was on; he visited La [[Beauce, France|Beauce]] (for ''[[La Terre]]''), [[Sedan, Ardennes]] (for ''[[La Débâcle]]'') and travelled on the railway line between Paris and [[Le Havre]] (when researching ''[[La Bête humaine]]'').<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gidSAAAAMAAJ&q=train+researce+bete+humaine |title=Steel Wheels: The Evolution of the Railways and how They Stimulated and Excited Engineers, Architects, Artists, Writers, Musicians and Travellers |last=Garnett |first=A.

==Characterisation==
[[Image:Manet, Edouard - Portrait of Emile Zola.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Édouard Manet]], ''Portrait of Émile Zola'', 1868, [[Musée d'Orsay]]]]
Zola strongly claimed that Naturalist literature is an experimental analysis of human psychology.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Considering this claim, many critics, such as [[György Lukács]],<ref>György Lukács, ''Studies in European Realism. A Sociological Survey of the Writings of Balzac, Stendhal, Zola, Tolstoy, Gorki and Others'', London: 1950, pp. 91–95.</ref> find Zola strangely poor at creating lifelike and memorable characters in the manner of [[Honoré de Balzac]] or [[Charles Dickens]], despite his ability to evoke powerful crowd scenes. It was important to Zola that no character should appear ''larger than'' life;<ref>Émile Zola, ''Les Romanciers naturalistes'', Paris: 1903, pp. 126–129.</ref> but the criticism that his characters are "cardboard" is substantially more damaging. Zola, by refusing to make any of his characters larger than life (if that is what he has indeed done), did not inhibit himself from also achieving [[verisimilitude]].

Although Zola found it scientifically and artistically unjustifiable to create larger-than-life characters, his work presents some larger-than-life symbols which, like the mine Le Voreux in ''[[Germinal (novel)|Germinal]]'',{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} take on the nature of a surrogate human life. The mine, the still in ''[[L'Assommoir]]'' and the locomotive La Lison in ''[[La Bête humaine]]'' impress the reader with the vivid reality of human beings.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} The great natural processes of seedtime and harvest, death and renewal in ''[[La Terre]]'' are instinct with a vitality which is not human but is the elemental energy of life.<ref>Letter from Émile Zola to Jules Lemaître, 14 March 1885.</ref> Human life is raised to the level of the mythical as the hammerblows of [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] are seemingly heard underground at Le Voreux or in ''[[La Faute de l'Abbé Mouret]]'', the walled park of Le Paradou encloses a re-enactment—and restatement—of the [[Book of Genesis]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Zola's optimism==
[[File:Luc Barbut Davray Zola.jpg|thumb|Luc Barbut-Davray, Portrait of Zola, Oil on Canvas, 1899]]
In Zola there is the theorist and the writer, the poet, the scientist and the optimist – features that are basically joined in his own confession of [[positivism]];{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} later in his life, when he saw his own position turning into an anachronism, he would still style himself with irony and sadness over the lost cause as "an old and rugged Positivist".<ref>See Émile Zola's speech at the annual banquet of the Students' Association at the Hotel Moderne in Paris, 20 May 1893, published in English by ''The New York Times'' on 11 June 1893 at [http://positivists.org/blog/archives/652 http://www.positivists.org].</ref>

The poet is the artist in words whose writing, as in the racecourse scene in ''[[Nana (novel)|Nana]]'' or in the descriptions of the laundry in ''[[L'Assommoir]]'' or in many passages of ''[[La Faute de l'Abbé Mouret]]'', ''[[Le Ventre de Paris]]'' and ''[[La Curée]]'', vies with the colourful impressionistic techniques of [[Claude Monet]] and [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]]. The scientist is a believer in some measure of scientific determinism – not that this, despite his own words "devoid of free will" ("''dépourvus de libre arbitre''"),<ref>Émile Zola, ''Les Œuvres complètes'', vol. 34, Paris: 1928, ''[[Thérèse Raquin]]'', preface to 2nd edition, p. viii.</ref> need always amount to a philosophical denial of [[free will]]. The creator of "''la littérature putride''", a term of abuse invented by an early critic of ''[[Thérèse Raquin]]'' (a novel which predates [[Les Rougon-Macquart]] series), emphasizes the squalid aspects of the human environment and upon the seamy side of human nature.<ref>Émile Zola, ''Les Œuvres complètes'', vol. 34, Paris: 1928, ''[[Thérèse Raquin]]'', preface to 2nd edition, p. xiv.</ref>

The optimist is that other face of the scientific experimenter, the man with an unshakable belief in human progress.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Zola bases his optimism on ''innéité'' and on the supposed capacity of the human race to make progress in a moral sense. ''Innéité'' is defined by Zola as that process in which "''se confondent les caractères physiques et moraux des parents, sans que rien d'eux semble s'y retrouver''";<ref>Émile Zola, ''Les Œuvres complètes'', vol. 22, Paris: 1928, ''[[Le Docteur Pascal]]'', p. 38.</ref> it is the term used in biology to describe the process whereby the moral and temperamental dispositions of some individuals are unaffected by the hereditary transmission of genetic characteristics. Jean Macquart and Pascal Rougon are two instances of individuals liberated from the blemishes of their ancestors by the operation of the process of ''innéité''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}
