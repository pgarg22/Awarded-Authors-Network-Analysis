'''Sir James Matthew Barrie, 1st Baronet''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OM}} ({{IPAc-en|'|b|æ|r|i}}; 9 May 1860{{spaced ndash}} 19 June 1937) was a Scottish novelist and playwright, best remembered as the creator of [[Peter Pan]]. He was born and educated in Scotland and then moved to London, where he wrote a number of successful novels and plays. There he met the [[Llewelyn Davies boys]], who inspired him to write about a baby boy who has magical adventures in [[Kensington Gardens]] (first included in Barrie's 1902 adult novel ''[[The Little White Bird]]''), then to write ''[[Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up]]'', a 1904 "fairy play" about an ageless boy and an ordinary girl named Wendy who have adventures in the fantasy setting of [[Neverland]].

Although he continued to write successfully, ''Peter Pan'' overshadowed his other work, and is credited with popularising the name [[Wendy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wendy.com/wendyweb/history.html |title=History of the name Wendy |publisher=Wendy.com |access-date=22 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318131510/http://www.wendy.com/wendyweb/history.html |archive-date=18 March 2009}}</ref> Barrie unofficially adopted the Davies boys following the deaths of their parents. Barrie was made a [[baronet]] by [[George V]] on 14 June 1913,<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=28733 |date=1 July 1913 |page=4638}}</ref> and a member of the [[Order of Merit (Commonwealth)|Order of Merit]] in the [[1922 New Year Honours]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=32563 |date=31 December 1921 |page=10713 |supp=y}}</ref> Before his death, he gave the rights to the Peter Pan works to [[Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children]] in London, which continues to benefit from them.

==Childhood and adolescence==
James Matthew Barrie was born in [[Kirriemuir]], Angus, to a conservative [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] family. His father David Barrie was a modestly successful weaver. His mother Margaret Ogilvy assumed her deceased mother's household responsibilities at the age of eight. Barrie was the ninth child of ten (two of whom died before he was born), all of whom were schooled in at least [[the three Rs]] in preparation for possible professional careers.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Adams |first1=James Eli |title=A History of Victorian Literature |date=2012 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |page=359}}</ref> He was a small child and drew attention to himself with storytelling.<ref>Alistair Moffat (2012). "Britain's Last Frontier: A Journey Along the Highland Line". Chapter 9. p. 1. Birlinn</ref> He grew to only 5&nbsp;ft 3{{frac|1|2}} in. (161&nbsp;cm) according to his 1934 passport.<ref name="Birkin" />

When James Barrie was six years old, his elder brother David (their mother's favourite) died in an ice-skating accident on the day before his 14th birthday.<ref>Birkin, Andrew: J. M. Barrie & the Lost Boys (Constable, 1979; revised edition, Yale University Press, 2003)</ref> This left his mother devastated, and Barrie tried to fill David's place in his mother's attentions, even wearing David's clothes and whistling in the manner that he did. One time, Barrie entered her room and heard her say, "Is that you?" "I thought it was the dead boy she was speaking to", wrote Barrie in his biographical account of his mother ''Margaret Ogilvy'' (1896) "and I said in a little lonely voice, 'No, it's no' him, it's just me.{{'"}} Barrie's mother found comfort in the fact that her dead son would remain a boy forever, never to grow up and leave her.<ref name="Birkin">Birkin, Andrew: ''J. M. Barrie & the Lost Boys'', Constable, 1979; revised edition, Yale University Press, 2003</ref> Eventually, Barrie and his mother entertained each other with stories of her brief childhood and books such as ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'', works by fellow Scotsman [[Walter Scott]], and ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]''.<ref name="Chaney" />

At the age of eight, Barrie was sent to [[the Glasgow Academy]] in the care of his eldest siblings Alexander and Mary Ann, who taught at the school. When he was 10, he returned home and continued his education at the [[Forfar Academy]]. At 14, he left home for [[Dumfries Academy]], again under the watch of Alexander and Mary Ann. He became a voracious reader, and was fond of [[penny dreadful]]s and the works of [[Robert Michael Ballantyne]] and [[James Fenimore Cooper]]. At [[Dumfries]], he and his friends spent time in the garden of [[Moat Brae]] house, playing pirates "in a sort of Odyssey that was long afterwards to become the play of ''Peter Pan''{{-"}}.<ref name="Speeches">''McConnachie and J.

==Literary career==
[[File:J. M. Barrie, 1892. (7893554540).jpg|thumb|upright|Barrie in 1892]]
Barrie knew that he wished to follow a career as an author. However, his family attempted to persuade him to choose a profession such as the ministry. With advice from Alexander, he was able to work out a compromise: he would attend a university, but would study literature.<ref name="White 1994">{{cite book|last=White|first=Donna R.S.|title=British Children's Writers, 1880–1914|year=1994|publisher=Gale|location=[[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]|isbn=978-0810355552|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/britishchildrens141zaid}}</ref> Barrie enrolled at the [[University of Edinburgh]] where he wrote drama reviews for the ''[[Edinburgh Courant|Edinburgh Evening Courant]]''. He graduated and obtained an M.A. on 21 April 1882.<ref name="White 1994"/>

Following a job advertisement found by his sister in ''[[The Scotsman]]'', he worked for a year and a half as a staff journalist on the ''[[Nottingham Journal]]''.<ref name="White 1994"/> Back in Kirriemuir, he submitted a piece to the ''St. James's Gazette'', a London newspaper, using his mother's stories about the town where she grew up (renamed "Thrums"). The editor "liked that Scotch thing" so well that Barrie ended up writing a series of these stories.<ref name="Chaney" /> They served as the basis for his first novels: ''Auld Licht Idylls'' (1888), ''A Window in Thrums'' (1890),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/gutbook/lookup?num=20914 |title=A Window in Thrums |last=J. M. Barrie |work=Project Gutenberg }}</ref> and ''The Little Minister'' (1891).

The stories depicted the "Auld Lichts", a strict religious sect to which his grandfather had once belonged.<ref name="White 1994"/> Modern literary criticism of these early works has been unfavourable, tending to disparage them as sentimental and nostalgic depictions of a parochial Scotland, far from the realities of the industrialised nineteenth century, seen as characteristic of what became known as the [[Kailyard School]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.litencyc.com/php/stopics.php?rec=true&UID=1286|title=Kailyard School|website=www.litencyc.com}}</ref> Despite, or perhaps because of, this, they were popular enough at the time to establish Barrie as a successful writer. Following that success, he published ''Better Dead'' (1888) privately and at his own expense, but it failed to sell.<ref name="White 1994"/> His two "Tommy" novels, ''Sentimental Tommy'' (1896) and ''Tommy and Grizel'' (1900), were about a boy and young man who clings to childish fantasy, with an unhappy ending. The English novelist [[George Gissing]] read the former in November 1896 and wrote that he "thoroughly dislike[d it]".<ref>Coustillas, Pierre ed. London and the Life of Literature in Late Victorian England: the Diary of George Gissing, Novelist. Brighton: Harvester Press, 1978, p.427.</ref>

Meanwhile, Barrie's attention turned increasingly to works for the theatre, beginning with a biography of [[Richard Savage (poet)|Richard Savage]], written by Barrie and [[H. B. Marriott Watson]]; it was performed only once and critically panned.<ref name="White 1994"/> He immediately followed this with ''Ibsen's Ghost'', or ''Toole Up-to-Date'' (1891),<ref name="White 1994"/> a [[parody]] of [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s dramas ''[[Hedda Gabler]]'' and ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]''. ''Ghosts'' had been unlicensed in the UK until 1914,<ref>Dominic Shellard, et al. ''The Lord Chamberlain Regrets'', 2004, British Library, pp. 77–79.</ref> but had created a sensation at the time from a single "club" performance.

[[Image:PeterPan Statue Londres.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Peter Pan statue]] (1912) by Sir [[George Frampton]] in [[Kensington Gardens]], London]]
The production of ''Ibsen's Ghost'' at [[Toole's Theatre]] in London was seen by [[William Archer (critic)|William Archer]], the translator of Ibsen's works into English. Apparently comfortable with the parody, he enjoyed the humour of the play and recommended it to others. Barrie's third play ''Walker, London'' (1892) resulted in his being introduced to a young actress named Mary Ansell. He proposed to her and they were married on 9 July 1894. Barrie bought her a [[Saint Bernard (dog)|Saint Bernard]] puppy, who played a part in the 1902 novel ''[[The Little White Bird]]''. He used Ansell's first name for many characters in his novels.<ref name="White 1994"/> Barrie also authored ''[[Jane Annie]]'', a [[comic opera]] for [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] (1893), which failed; he persuaded [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] to revise and finish it for him.

In 1901 and 1902, he had back-to-back successes; ''[[Quality Street (play)|Quality Street]]'' was about a respectable, responsible [[Spinster|old maid]] who poses as her own flirtatious niece to try to win the attention of a former suitor returned from the war. ''[[The Admirable Crichton]]'' was a critically acclaimed social commentary with elaborate staging, about an aristocratic family and their household servants whose social order is inverted after they are shipwrecked on a desert island. [[Max Beerbohm]] thought it "quite the best thing that has happened, in my time, to the British theatre".<ref>{{cite news |title=Tales from the cabbage patch |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2006/jan/11/theatre.fiction |access-date=2 August 2019 |work=The Guardian}}</ref>

The character of "Peter Pan" first appeared in ''[[The Little White Bird]]''. The novel was published in the UK by [[Hodder & Stoughton]] in 1902, and serialised in the US in the same year in ''[[Scribner's Magazine]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Concise Oxford Chronology of English Literature|first=Michael |last=Cox|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0198610540|page=428}}</ref> Barrie's more famous and enduring work ''[[Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up]]'' had its first stage performance on 27 December 1904 at the [[West End theatre|West End]]’s [[Duke of York's Theatre]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KdVAAAAAIBAJ&pg=4415%2C5760076 |title=Mr Barrie's New Play. A Christmas Fairy Tale |work=The Glasgow Herald |date=28 December 1904 |page=7 |access-date=26 May 2018}}</ref> This play introduced audiences to the name ''Wendy''; it was inspired by a young girl named [[Margaret Henley]] who called Barrie "Friendy", but could not pronounce her ''R''s very well. The [[Bloomsbury]] scenes show the societal constraints of late Victorian and Edwardian middle class domestic reality, contrasted with [[Neverland]], a world where morality is ambivalent. [[George Bernard Shaw]] described the play as "ostensibly a holiday entertainment for children but really a play for grown-up people", suggesting deeper social metaphors at work in ''Peter Pan''.

Barrie had a long string of successes on the stage after ''Peter Pan'', many of which discuss social concerns, as Barrie continued to integrate his work and his beliefs. ''The Twelve Pound Look'' (1910) concerns a wife leaving her 'typical' husband once she can gain an independent income. Other plays, such as ''[[Mary Rose (play)|Mary Rose]]'' (1920) and ''[[Dear Brutus]]'' (1917), revisit the idea of the ageless child and parallel worlds. Barrie was involved in the 1909 and 1911 attempts to challenge the censorship of the theatre by the [[Lord Chamberlain]], along with a number of other playwrights.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nBp67DPLZaEC&pg=PA38|page=38|first=Thomas|last=Postlewait|chapter=The London Stage, 1895–1918|title=The Cambridge History of British Theatre|isbn=978-0521651325|year=2004}}</ref>

In 1911, Barrie developed the ''Peter Pan'' play into the novel ''[[Peter and Wendy]]''. In April 1929, Barrie gave the [[copyright]] of the Peter Pan works to [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]], a leading children's hospital in London. The [[Peter and Wendy#Copyright status|current status of the copyright]] is somewhat complex. His final play was ''The Boy David'' (1936), which dramatised the Biblical story of King [[Saul]] and the young [[David]]. Like the role of Peter Pan, that of David was played by a woman, [[Elisabeth Bergner]], for whom Barrie wrote the play.<ref name="methuen">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tb-OAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA45|pages=44–45|title=The Methuen Drama Dictionary of the Theatre|editor=Jonathan Law|year=2013|isbn=978-1408131480 }}</ref>

== Social connections ==
[[File:Sir James M. Barrie.jpg|thumb|Sir James Barrie, around 1895]]

Barrie moved in literary circles and had many famous friends in addition to his professional collaborators. Novelist [[George Meredith]] was an early social [[Patronage|patron]]. He had a long correspondence with fellow Scot [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], who lived in [[Samoa]] at the time. Stevenson invited Barrie to visit him, but the two never met.<ref>Shaw, Michael (ed.) (2020), ''A Friendship in Letters: Robert Louis Stevenson & J.M. Barrie'', Sandstone Press, Inverness {{ISBN|978-1-913207-02-1}}</ref> <ref name="NY Times"/> He was also friends with fellow Scots writer [[S. R. Crockett]]. [[George Bernard Shaw]] was his neighbour in London for several years, and once participated in a Western that Barrie scripted and filmed. [[H. G. Wells]] was a friend of many years, and tried to intervene when Barrie's marriage fell apart. Barrie met [[Thomas Hardy]] through [[Hugh Clifford]] while he was staying in London.<ref name="NY Times"/>

After the [[First World War]], Barrie sometimes stayed at [[Stanway House]] near the village of [[Stanway, Gloucestershire|Stanway]] in [[Gloucestershire]]. He paid for the pavilion at Stanway [[cricket]] ground.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Page |first1=William |title=The Victoria History of the County of Gloucester, Volume 6 |date=1965 |publisher=A. Constable, limited |page=226}}</ref> In 1887, he founded an amateur cricket team for friends of similarly limited playing ability, and named it the [[Allahakbarries]] under the mistaken belief that "Allah akbar" meant "Heaven help us" in Arabic (rather than "God is great").<ref>{{cite web|author1=Tim Masters|title=How Peter Pan's author invented celebrity cricket|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8662375.stm|website=BBC News|access-date=2 August 2019|date=7 May 2010}}</ref> Some of the best known British authors from the era played on the team at various times, including [[H. G. Wells]], [[Rudyard Kipling]], [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[P. G. Wodehouse]], [[Jerome K. Jerome]], [[G. K. Chesterton]], [[A. A. Milne]], [[E. W. Hornung]], [[A. E. W. Mason]], [[Walter Raleigh (professor)|Walter Raleigh]], [[E. V. Lucas]], [[Maurice Hewlett]], [[Owen Seaman]] (editor of ''[[Punch magazine|Punch]]''), [[Bernard Partridge]], [[George Cecil Ives]], [[George Llewelyn Davies]] (see below) and the son of [[Alfred Tennyson]]. In 1891, Barrie joined the newly formed [[Authors Cricket Club]] and also played for its cricket team, the Authors XI, alongside Doyle, Wodehouse and Milne. The Allahakbarries and the Authors XI continued to exist side by side until 1912.<ref name="Chaney" /><ref>{{cite news |last=Parkinson |first=Justin |date=26 July 2014 |title=Authors and actors revive cricket rivalry |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-27903864 |work= BBC News Magazine|access-date=10 April 2019}}</ref>

Barrie befriended Africa explorer [[Joseph Thomson (explorer)|Joseph Thomson]] and Antarctica explorer [[Robert Falcon Scott]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/jm-barrie-and-captain-scott-two-friends-who-took-the-world-by-storm-1-808141|title=Two friends who took the world by storm|last=Smith|first=Mark|date=2 September 2010|work=The Scotsman|access-date=2 September 2010}}</ref> He was [[godparent|godfather]] to Scott's son [[Peter Scott|Peter]],<ref name="Chaney">Chaney, Lisa.

Barrie was so proud of the letter that he carried it around for the rest of his life.<ref name="White 1994"/>

In 1896, his agent Addison Bright persuaded him to meet with Broadway producer [[Charles Frohman]], who became his financial backer and a close friend, as well.<ref name="White 1994"/> Frohman was responsible for producing the debut of ''Peter Pan'' in both England and the US, as well as other productions of Barrie's plays. He famously declined a lifeboat seat when the [[RMS Lusitania|RMS ''Lusitania'']] was sunk by a German [[U-boat]] in the North Atlantic. Actress [[Rita Jolivet]] stood with Frohman, George Vernon and Captain Alick Scott at the end of Lusitania's sinking, but she survived the sinking and recalled Frohman paraphrasing ''Peter Pan'': 'Why fear death? It is the most beautiful adventure that life gives us.'<ref>Ellis, Frederick D., ''The Tragedy of the Lusitania'' (National Publishing Company, 1915), pp. 38–39; Preston, Diana, ''Lusitania, An Epic Tragedy'' (Walker & Company, 2002), p. 204; ''New York Tribune'', "Frohman Calm; Not Concerned About Death, Welcomed It as Beautiful Adventure, He Told Friends at End", 11 May 1915, p. 3; Marcosson, Isaac Frederick, & Daniel Frohman, ''Charles Frohman: Manager and Man'' (John Lane, The Bodley Head, 1916), p. 387; Frohman, Charles, [http://rmslusitania.info/pages/saloon_class/frohman_charles.html ''The Lusitania Resource'']</ref>

His secretary from 1917, [[Cynthia Asquith]], was the daughter-in-law of [[H. H. Asquith]], British Prime Minister from 1908 to 1916.<ref name="Telegraph"/> In the 1930s, Barrie met and told stories to the young daughters of the [[George VI of the United Kingdom|Duke of York]], the future [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]].<ref name="Telegraph">{{cite news|title=Captain Scott and J M Barrie: an unlikely friendship|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/9086554/Captain-Scott-and-J-M-Barrie-an-unlikely-friendship.html|access-date=2 April 2015|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref> After meeting him, the three-year-old Princess Margaret announced, "He is my greatest friend and I am his greatest friend".<ref name="NY Times">{{cite news |title=THE LAST WORD; The Lost Boy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/14/books/the-last-word-the-lost-boy.html |access-date=2 August 2019 |work=The New York Times}}</ref>

==Marriage==

Barrie became acquainted with actress [[Mary Ansell (actress)|Mary Ansell]] in 1891, when he asked his friend [[Jerome K. Jerome]] for a pretty actress to play a role in his play ''Walker, London''. The two became friends, and she helped his family to care for him when he fell very ill in 1893 and 1894.<ref name="Chaney"/> They married in Kirriemuir on 9 July 1894,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/research/learning/hall-of-fame/hall-of-fame-a-z/barrie-j-m |title=Hall of Fame A–Z: J M Barrie (1860–1937) |date=31 May 2013 |publisher=National Records of Scotland |access-date=14 April 2018}}</ref> shortly after Barrie recovered, and Mary retired from the stage.  The wedding was a small ceremony in his parents' home, in the Scottish tradition. The relationship was reportedly unconsummated,<ref>Birkin, Andrew: ''J. M. Barrie & the Lost Boys'' Constable, 1979; revised edition, [[Yale University Press]], 2003</ref> and the couple had no children.

In 1895, the Barries bought a house on Gloucester Road, in South Kensington.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/property/3349995/Round-the-houses-Peter-Pan.html|title=Round the houses: Peter Pan|last=Stogdon|first=Catalina|date=17 May 2006|work=The Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|access-date=14 May 2015}}</ref> Barrie would take long walks in nearby Kensington Gardens, and in 1900 the couple moved into a house directly overlooking the gardens at 100 [[Bayswater Road]]. Mary had a flair for interior design and set about transforming the ground floor, creating two large reception rooms with painted panelling and adding fashionable features, such as a conservatory.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/style/homes_and_gardens/Move/article1553378.ece |url-access=subscription |title=Return to Neverland|last=Law|first=Cally|date=10 May 2015|work=The Sunday Times|publisher= Times Newspapers Limited|access-date=14 May 2015}}</ref> In the same year, Mary found Black Lake Cottage at [[Farnham]] in [[Surrey]], which became the couple's "bolt hole" where Barrie could entertain his cricketing friends and the Llewelyn Davies family.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.surreymonocle.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=33 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307100750/http://www.surreymonocle.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=33 |archive-date=7 March 2009 |title=JM Barrie |publisher=Surrey Monocle |date=10 January 2007 |access-date=22 July 2009}} Retrieved from Internet Archive 27 December 2013.</ref>

Beginning in mid-1908, Mary had an affair with [[Gilbert Cannan]] (who was twenty years younger than she<ref name=holroyd>Michael Holroyd, ''Lytton Strachey'', p. 287</ref> and an associate of Barrie in his anti-censorship activities), including a visit together to Black Lake Cottage, known only to the house staff. When Barrie learned of the affair in July 1909, he demanded that she end it, but she refused. To avoid the scandal of divorce, he offered a legal separation if she would agree not to see Cannan any more, but she still refused. Barrie sued for divorce on the grounds of infidelity; the divorce was granted in October 1909.<ref name="Birkin"/><ref>{{cite news |title=J.M.

==Llewelyn Davies family==
[[file:JackLlewelynDavies6-BoyCastaways.JPG|thumb|left|[[Jack Llewelyn Davies]] acting in Barrie's pirate adventure, ''The Boy Castaways of Black Lake Island'', 1901]]
The Llewelyn Davies family played an important part in Barrie's literary and personal life, consisting of [[Arthur Llewelyn Davies|Arthur]] (1863–1907), [[Sylvia Llewelyn Davies|Sylvia]] (1866–1910) (daughter of [[George du Maurier]]),<ref>married the 3Q of 1892 in Hampstead, London: GROMI: vol. 1a, p. 1331</ref> and [[Llewelyn Davies boys|their five sons]]: [[George Llewelyn Davies|George]] (1893–1915), [[Jack Llewelyn Davies|John]] (Jack) (1894–1959), [[Peter Llewelyn Davies|Peter]] (1897–1960), [[Michael Llewelyn Davies|Michael]] (1900–1921) and [[Nicholas Llewelyn Davies|Nicholas]] (Nico) (1903–1980).

Barrie became acquainted with the family in 1897, meeting George and Jack (and baby Peter) with their nurse ([[nanny]]) Mary Hodgson in London's [[Kensington Gardens]]. He lived nearby and often walked his Saint Bernard dog Porthos<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://neverpedia.com/pan/Porthos|title=Porthos – Neverpedia, the Peter Pan wiki|website=neverpedia.com}}</ref> in the park. He entertained the boys regularly with his ability to wiggle his ears and eyebrows, and with his stories. He did not meet Sylvia until a chance encounter at a dinner party in December. She told Barrie that Peter had been named after the title character in her father's novel, ''Peter Ibbetson''.<ref name="White 1994"/>

Barrie became a regular visitor at the Davies household and a common companion to Sylvia and her boys, despite the fact that both he and she were married to other people.<ref name="Birkin"/> In 1901, he invited the Davies family to Black Lake Cottage, where he produced an album of captioned photographs of the boys acting out a pirate adventure, entitled ''The Boy Castaways of Black Lake Island''. Barrie had two copies made, one of which he gave to Arthur, who misplaced it on a train.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jmbarrie.co.uk/boycastaways/ab_on_JMB_RSC.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722005156/http://www.jmbarrie.co.uk/boycastaways/ab_on_JMB_RSC.html |archive-date=22 July 2011 |title=Andrew Birkin on J.

The character of Peter Pan was invented to entertain George and Jack. Barrie would say, to amuse them, that their little brother Peter could fly. He claimed that babies were birds before they were born; parents put bars on nursery windows to keep the little ones from flying away. This grew into a tale of a baby boy who did fly away.<ref name="White 1994"/>

Arthur Llewelyn Davies died in 1907, and "Uncle Jim" became even more involved with the Davies family, providing financial support to them. (His income from ''Peter Pan'' and other works was easily adequate to provide for their living expenses and education.) Following Sylvia's death in 1910, Barrie claimed that they had recently been engaged to be married.<ref name="Birkin"/> Her will indicated nothing to that effect but specified her wish for "J. M. B." to be trustee and guardian to the boys, along with her mother Emma, her brother [[Guy du Maurier]] and Arthur's brother Compton. It expressed her confidence in Barrie as the boys' caretaker and her wish for "the boys to treat him (& their uncles) with absolute confidence & straightforwardness & to talk to him about everything." When copying the will informally for Sylvia's family a few months later, Barrie inserted himself elsewhere: Sylvia had written that she would like Mary Hodgson, the boys' nurse, to continue taking care of them, and for "Jenny" (referring to Hodgson's sister) to come and help her; Barrie instead wrote, "Jimmy" (Sylvia's nickname for him). Barrie and Hodgson did not get along well but served together as surrogate parents until the boys were grown.<ref name="Birkin"/>
[[File:1899-08-08-Porthos.jpg|left|thumb|Porthos in 1899.]]
Barrie also had friendships with other children, both before he met the Davies boys and after they had grown up, and there has since been unsubstantiated speculation that Barrie was a [[paedophilia|paedophile]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Justine Picardie Published: 12:01&nbsp; am BST 13 July 2008 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/donotmigrate/3556421/How-bad-was-J.M.-Barrie.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304154450/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/donotmigrate/3556421/How-bad-was-J.M.-Barrie.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 March 2009 |title=How bad was J.

Nico, the youngest of the brothers, denied as an adult that Barrie ever behaved inappropriately.<ref name="Birkin"/> "I don't believe that Uncle Jim ever experienced what one might call 'a stirring in the undergrowth' for anyone—man, woman, or child", he stated. "He was an innocent—which is why he could write Peter Pan."<ref name="Birkin"/> His relationships with the surviving Davies boys continued well beyond their childhood and adolescence.

The [[Peter Pan statue]] in Kensington Gardens, erected secretly overnight for [[May Morning]] in 1912, was supposed to be modelled upon old photographs of Michael dressed as the character. However, the sculptor, [[Sir George Frampton]], used a different child as a model, leaving Barrie disappointed with the result. "It doesn't show the devil in Peter", he said.<ref name="Birkin"/>

Barrie suffered bereavements with the boys, losing the two to whom he was closest in their early twenties. George was killed in action in 1915, in the [[First World War]].<ref>{{cwgc|id=456458|name=Davies, George Llewelyn|access-date=24 August 2016}}</ref> Michael, with whom Barrie corresponded daily while at boarding school and university, drowned in 1921, with his friend, Rupert Buxton,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jmbarrie.co.uk/audio/?mode=3 |title=Audio |publisher=Jmbarrie.co.uk |access-date=8 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930032624/http://www.jmbarrie.co.uk/audio/?mode=3 |archive-date=30 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://neverpedia.com/pan/Rupert_Buxton |title=Rupert Buxton |publisher=Neverpedia.com |access-date=28 December 2010}}</ref> at a known danger spot at [[Sandford Lock]] near [[Oxford]], one month short of his 21st birthday. Some years after Barrie's death, Peter compiled his ''Morgue'' from family letters and papers, interpolated with his own informed comments on his family and their relationship with Barrie. [[Peter Llewelyn Davies#Death|Peter died]] in 1960 by throwing himself in front of an Underground train at Sloane Square station.

==Death==
[[File:Gravestone of playwright J M Barrie.jpg|thumb|upright|Gravestone of J. M. Barrie in Kirriemuir Cemetery]]
Barrie died of [[pneumonia]] at a nursing home in Manchester Street, [[Marylebone]] on 19 June 1937.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gFBAAAAAIBAJ&pg=5491%2C3212516 |title=Death of Sir J.

He left the bulk of his estate to his secretary [[Lady Cynthia Asquith]], but excluding the rights to all [[Peter Pan]] works (which included ''[[The Little White Bird]]'', ''[[Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens]]'', the play ''[[Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Would Not Grow Up]]'' and the novel ''Peter and Wendy''), whose copyright he had previously given to [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]] in London. The surviving Llewelyn Davies boys received legacies, and he made provisions for his former wife Mary Ansell to receive an annuity during her lifetime.<ref>Birkin, Andrew: J. M. ''Barrie & the Lost Boys'' (Constable, 1979; revised edition, Yale University Press, 2004)</ref>

His will also left £500 to the Bower Free Church in [[Caithness]] to mark the memory of Rev James Winter who was to have married Barrie's sister in June 1892 but was killed in a fall from his horse in May 1892. Barrie had several connections to the Free Church of Scotland, including his maternal uncle Rev David Ogilvy (1822–1904), who was minister of Dalziel Church in [[Motherwell]].<ref>Ewing, William ''Annals of the Free Church''; James Winter</ref> James and his brother William Winter (also a Free Church minister) were both born in [[Cortachy]] the sons of Rev William Winter.

Barrie was the only person to receive the Freedom of Kirriemuir in a ceremony on 7 June 1930 in Kirriemuir Town Hall where he was presented with a silver casket containing the freedom scroll. The casket was made by silversmiths Brook & Son in Edinburgh in 1929 and is decorated with images of sites in Kirriemuir which held significant memories for Barrie: Kirriemuir Townhouse, Strathview, Window in Thrums, the statue of Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens and the Barrie Cricket Pavilion.
