'''James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose''' (1612<!-- Remark, moved here from the Persondata: "sometime after 22 October 1612 based on Napier's record that on 22 October 1632 Montrose was transacting business as a minor." See also the [[Template:Editnotices/Page/James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose|editnotice]] from 21 August 2011, the birth date '25 October 1612' has been inserted on 21 February 2012 by IP 121.208.214.124.) --> &ndash; 21 May 1650) was a Scottish [[nobleman]], [[poet]] and [[soldier]], [[Lord Lieutenant|lord lieutenant]] and later [[viceroy]] and [[captain general]] of [[Scotland]]. Montrose initially joined the [[Covenanter]]s in the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]], but subsequently supported King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] as the [[English Civil War]] developed. From 1644 to 1646, and again in 1650, he fought in the [[Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|civil war in Scotland]] on behalf of the King. He is referred to as the '''Great Montrose'''.

Following his defeat and capture at the [[Battle of Carbisdale]], Montrose was tried by the [[Parliament of Scotland|Scottish Parliament]] and sentenced to death by [[hanging]], followed by [[Decapitation|beheading]] and [[Hanged, drawn and quartered|quartering]]. After the [[Stuart Restoration|Restoration]], [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] paid £802 sterling for a lavish funeral in 1661, when Montrose's reputation changed from [[treason|traitor]] or [[martyr]] to a romantic hero and subject of works by [[Walter Scott]] and [[John Buchan]].<ref>{{cite book |contribution="A Candidate for Immortality": Martyrdom, Memory, and the Marquis of Montrose |author=Bennett, Rachel |date=20 September 2017 |editor=McCorristine, S. |title=Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Mortality and its Timings.

== Family and education ==
James Graham, chief of [[Clan Graham]], was the youngest of six children and the only son<ref>{{harvnb|Buchan|1928|p=20}}</ref> of [[John Graham, 4th Earl of Montrose]], and Lady Margaret Ruthven.<ref>{{cite book |first=John |last=Buchan |title=Montrose: A History |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]]: The Riverside Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|year=1928|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.57954/mode/2up|page=35|chapter=Chapter 2: The Strife in Scotland|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.57954/page/n57/mode/2up|via=[[archive.org]]|ref=none}}</ref> The exact date and place of his birth are unknown, but it was probably in mid-October.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://montrose-society.ndo.co.uk/graham.htm|title=The 1st Marquis of Montrose Society|access-date=15 December 2020}}</ref> His maternal grandparents were [[William Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie]], and Dorothea, a daughter of [[Henry Stewart, 1st Lord Methven]] and his second wife Janet Stewart. Her maternal grandparents were [[John Stewart, 2nd Earl of Atholl]] and Lady Janet Campbell. Janet Campbell was a daughter of [[Archibald Campbell, 2nd Earl of Argyll]] and Elizabeth Stewart. Elizabeth was a daughter of [[John Stewart, 1st Earl of Lennox]] and Margaret Montgomerie. Margaret was a daughter of Alexander Montgomerie, 1st Lord Montgomerie and Margaret Boyd.

Graham studied at age twelve at the college of Glasgow under William Forrett who later tutored his sons.<ref name=Buchan21>{{harvnb|Buchan|1928|p=21}}</ref> At Glasgow, he read [[Xenophon]] and [[Seneca the Elder|Seneca]], and [[Torquato Tasso|Tasso]] in translation.<ref name=Buchan21 /> In the words of biographer [[John Buchan]], his favourite book was a "splendid folio of the first edition" of ''History of the World'' by [[Walter Raleigh]].<ref name=Buchan21 />

Graham became 5th [[Earl of Montrose]] by his father's death in 1626.<ref>{{harvnb|Buchan|1928|p=36}}</ref> He was then educated at [[St Salvator's College, St Andrews|Saint Salvator's College]] at the [[University of St Andrews]].<ref>{{harvnb|Buchan|1928|p=22}}</ref>

At the age of seventeen, he married Magdalene Carnegie,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/biog/montrose.htm|title=British Civil Wars: James Graham, 1st Marquis of Montrose, 1612–1650|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208015836/http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/biog/montrose.htm|archive-date=Dec 8, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> who was the youngest of six daughters<ref name=Buchan24 /> of [[David Carnegie, 1st Earl of Southesk|David Carnegie]] (afterwards [[Earl of Southesk]]).

In 1638, after King Charles I had attempted to impose an [[Episcopalianism in the Kirk|Episcopalian]] version of the Book of Common Prayer upon the reluctant Scots, resistance spread throughout the country, eventually culminating in the [[Bishops' Wars]].<ref>{{harvnb|Buchan|1928|pp=44–76}}</ref> Montrose joined the party of resistance, and was for some time one of its most energetic champions.<ref>{{harvnb|Buchan|1928|p=75}}</ref> He had nothing [[puritanical]] in his nature, but he shared in the ill-feeling aroused by the political authority King Charles had given to the bishops. He signed the [[National Covenant]], and was part of [[Alexander Leslie]]'s army sent to suppress the opposition which arose around [[Aberdeen]] and in the country of the Gordons. Though often cited as commander of the expedition, the Aberdeen Council letter books are explicit that the troops entered Aberdeen "under the conduct of General Leslie" who remained in charge in the city until 12 April.<ref>{{cite book|author=Louise B. Taylor (ed.)|title=Aberdeen Council Letters (6 vols.

Cowan|title=Montrose: For Covenant and King|location=Edinburgh|year=1995|page=64}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Murdoch|first=Grosjean|title=Alexander Leslie|page=99}}</ref> Three times Montrose entered Aberdeen. On the second occasion, the leader of the Gordons, the [[George Gordon, 2nd Marquess of Huntly|Marquess of Huntly]] entered the city under a pass of safe conduct but ended up accompanying Montrose to Edinburgh, with his supporters saying as a prisoner and in breach of the pass, but Cowan<ref>{{harvnb|E. J. Cowan|1995|p=73}}</ref> is clear Huntly chose to go voluntarily, rather than as prisoner, noting "by giving out he had been forced to accompany Montrose he was neatly easing his own predicament and at the same time sparing Montrose a great deal of embarrassment". Spalding<ref>{{cite book|author=John Spalding|title=Memorialls of the Trubles in Scotland and in England 1624-1655, 2 vols|location=Aberdeen|year=1850}}</ref> also supports that Huntly went voluntarily. Montrose was a leader of the delegation who subsequently met at [[Muchalls Castle]] to parley regarding the 1638 confrontation with the [[Bishop of Aberdeen]]. With the [[William Keith, 7th Earl Marischal|Earl Marischal]] he led a force of 9000 men across the [[Causey Mounth]] through the [[Portlethen Moss]] to attack [[Cavalier|Royalist]]s at the [[Battle of the Brig of Dee]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=17932|author=C.Michael Hogan|title=Causey Mounth|website=Megalithic Portal|editor=Andy Burnham|date=Nov 3, 2007|access-date={{today}}}}</ref> These events played a part in [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s decision to grant major concessions to the [[Covenanter]]s.

In July 1639, after the signing of the [[Treaty of Berwick (1639)|Treaty of Berwick]], Montrose was one of the Covenanting leaders who visited Charles. His change of mind, eventually leading to his support for the King, arose from his wish to get rid of the bishops without making [[Presbyterians]] masters of the state. His was essentially a layman's view of the situation. Taking no account of the real forces of the time, he aimed at an ideal form of society in which the clergy should confine themselves to their spiritual duties, and the King should uphold law and order. In the Scottish parliament which met in September, Montrose found himself opposed by [[Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll]], who had gradually assumed leadership of the Presbyterian and national party, and of the estate of [[Burgess (title)|burgesses]]. Montrose, on the other hand, wished to bring the King's authority to bear upon parliament to defeat Argyll, and offered the King the support of a great number of nobles. He failed, because Charles could not even then consent to abandon the bishops, and because no Scottish party of any weight could be formed unless [[Presbyterianism]] were established as the ecclesiastical power in Scotland.

Rather than give way, Charles prepared in 1640 to invade Scotland. Montrose was of necessity driven to play something of a double game. In August 1640 he signed the [[Bond of Cumbernauld]] as a protest against the particular and direct practising of a few, in other words, against the ambition of Argyll. But he took his place amongst the defenders of his country, and in the same month displayed his gallantry in action at the forcing of the [[River Tyne]] at [[Newburn]]. On 27 May 1641 he was summoned before the [[Committee of Estates]] and charged with intrigues against Argyll, and on 11 June he was imprisoned by them in [[Edinburgh Castle]]. Charles visited Scotland to give his formal assent to the abolition of [[Episcopacy]], and upon the King's return to England, Montrose shared in the amnesty tacitly accorded to all Charles's partisans.

The king signed a warrant for his [[Marquess]]ate and appointed Montrose [[Lord Lieutenant]] of Scotland, both in 1644. A year later in 1645, the king commissioned him [[captain general]].<ref>{{harvnb|Buchan|1928|p=139}}</ref> His military campaigns were fought quickly and used the element of surprise to overcome his opponents even when sometimes dauntingly outnumbered. At one point, Montrose dressed himself as the [[groom (profession)|groom]] of the [[Alexander Leslie, 1st Earl of Leven|Earl of Leven]] and travelled away from [[Carlisle]], and the eventual capture of his party, in disguise with "two followers, four sorry horses, little money and no baggage".<ref>{{harvnb|Buchan|1928|pp=151–152}}</ref>

Highlanders had never before been known to combine, but Montrose knew that many of the West Highland clans, who were largely [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]], detested Argyll and his [[Clan Campbell|Campbell]] clansmen, and none more so than the [[Clan Donald|MacDonalds]] who with many of the other clans rallied to his summons. The Royalist allied [[Confederate Ireland|Irish Confederates]] sent 2000 disciplined Irish soldiers led by [[Alasdair MacColla]] across the sea to assist him. The Irish proved to be formidable fighters.<ref>"...it is not hard to understand how in Gaelic legend his[Alasdair's] fame is made to outshine Montrose's" in {{harvnb|Buchan|1928|p=219}}, also July and August 1645, "the thousand Irish were probably the best infantry at the time in Britain" on p. 235.</ref>

In two campaigns, distinguished by rapidity of movement, he met and defeated his opponents in six battles. At [[battle of Tippermuir|Tippermuir]] and [[Battle of Aberdeen (1644)|Aberdeen]] he routed Covenanting levies; at [[Battle of Inverlochy (1645)|Inverlochy]] he crushed the Campbells, at [[Battle of Auldearn|Auldearn]], [[battle of Alford|Alford]] and [[battle of Kilsyth|Kilsyth]] his victories were obtained over well-led and disciplined armies.<ref>{{cite book|author=George Wishart|title=Memoirs of the Most Renowned James Graham, Marquis of Montrose|year=1819|publisher=A. Constable, 530 pages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ws5iG6WJzGQC|via=[[Google Books]]}}</ref>

The fiery enthusiasm of the Gordons and other clans often carried the day, but Montrose relied more upon the disciplined infantry from Ireland. His strategy at Inverlochy, and his tactics at Aberdeen, Auldearn and Kilsyth furnished models of the military art, but above all his daring and constancy marked him out as one of the greatest soldiers of the war. His career of victory was crowned by the great [[Battle of Kilsyth]] on 15 August 1645.

[[File:The marquis looked so handsome, grand and grave that every one had full of sad astonishment.jpg|thumb|Montrose in streets of Edinburgh before the day of his hanging]]
Now Montrose found himself apparently master of Scotland. After Kilsyth, the king's secretary arrived with letters from Charles documenting that Montrose was lieutenant and captain general. He first conferred knighthood on Alasdair.<ref>{{harvnb|Buchan|1928|pp=246–247}}</ref> Then he summoned a parliament to meet at [[Glasgow]] on 20 October, in which he no doubt hoped to reconcile loyal obedience to the King with the establishment of a non-political Presbyterian clergy. That parliament never met. Charles had been defeated at the [[Battle of Naseby]] on 14 June 1645, and Montrose had to come to his aid if there was to be still a king to proclaim. [[David Leslie (Scottish general)|David Leslie]], one of the best Scottish generals, was promptly dispatched against Montrose to anticipate the invasion. On 12 September he came upon Montrose, who had been deserted by his Highlanders and was guarded only by a little group of followers, at [[Battle of Philiphaugh|Philiphaugh]]. He won an easy victory. Montrose cut his way through to the Highlands; but he failed to organise an army. In September 1646 he embarked for [[Norway]]. Stories of his victories as documented in Latin by [[George Wishart (bishop)|George Wishart]] reached the continent and he was offered an appointment as lieutenant-general in the French army, and the Emperor Ferdinand III awarded him the rank of field marshal, but Montrose remained devoted to the service of King Charles and so his son, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bcw-project.org/biography/james-graham-marquis-of-montrose|title=Biography of James Graham, 1st Marquis of Montrose|website=BCW Project|access-date=15 December 2020}}</ref>

[[File:Montrose-St Giles-20071011.jpg|thumb|The exhumed body of Montrose was placed inside [[St. Giles' Cathedral]]. His tomb is inscribed with lines from one of his poems, "Scatter my ashes, strew them in the air/Lord, since thou knowest where all these atoms are..."]]
Montrose was to appear once more on the stage of Scottish history. In June 1649, eager to avenge the death of the King, he was restored by the exiled [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] to the now nominal lieutenancy of Scotland. Charles, however, did not scruple soon afterwards to disavow his noblest supporter to become King on terms dictated by Argyll and his adherents. In March 1650 Montrose landed in [[Orkney]] to take command of a small force which he had sent on before him with [[George Hay, 3rd Earl of Kinnoull]]. Crossing to the mainland, he tried in vain to raise the clans, and on 27 April was surprised and routed at the [[Battle of Carbisdale]] in [[Ross-shire]]. His forces were defeated in battle but he escaped. After wandering for some time he was surrendered by Neil MacLeod of Assynt at [[Ardvreck Castle]], to whose protection, in ignorance of [[Clan MacLeod|MacLeod's]] political enmity, he had entrusted himself. He was brought a prisoner to Edinburgh, and on 20 May sentenced to death by the parliament. He was [[hanging|hanged]] on the 21st, with Wishart's laudatory biography of him around his neck. He protested to the last that he was in truth a Covenanter and a loyal subject.

His head was removed and stood on the "prick on the highest stone" of the [[Old Tolbooth, Edinburgh|Old Tolbooth]] outside [[St Giles' Cathedral]] from 1650 until the beginning of 1661.<ref>{{cite book|last=Grant|first=James|author-link=James Grant (1822–1887)|title=Old And New Edinburgh|edition=volumes 1–3 or 1–6, edition dependent|publisher= Cassell|date=1880s|format=published as a periodical|url=http://www.oldandnewedinburgh.co.uk/|page=124}}</ref>

Shortly after Montrose's death the Scottish Argyll Government switched sides to support [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]'s attempt to regain the English throne, providing he was willing to impose the [[Solemn League and Covenant]] in England for a trial period at least. After the [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration]] Montrose was officially rehabilitated in the public memory.

On 7 January 1661 Montrose's mangled torso was disinterred from the gallows ground on the [[Burgh Muir]] and carried under a velvet canopy to the Tolbooth, where his head was reverently removed from the spike, before the procession continued on its way to [[Holyrood Abbey]]. The diarist [[John Nicoll (chronicler)|John Nicoll]] wrote the following eyewitness account of the event,

<blockquote>[A guard of honour of four captains with their companies, all of them in] thair armes and displayit colouris, quha eftir a lang space marching up an doun the streitis, went out thaireftir to the Burrow mure quhair his corps wer bureyit, and quhair sundry nobles and gentrie his freindis and favorites, both hors and fute wer thair attending; and thair, in presence of sundry nobles, earls, lordis, barones and otheris convenit for the tyme, his graif [grave] was raisit, his body and bones taken out and wrappit up in curious clothes and put in a coffin, quhilk, under a canopy of rich velwet, wer careyit from the Burrow-mure to the Toun of Edinburgh; the nobles barones and gentrie on hors, the Toun of Edinburgh and many thousandis besyde, convoyit these corpis all along, the callouris [colours] fleying, drums towking [beating], trumpettis sounding, muskets cracking and cannones from the Castell roring; all of thame walking on till thai come to the Tolbuith of Edinburgh, frae the quhilke his heid wes very honorablie and with all dew respectis taken doun and put within the coffin under the cannopie with great acclamation and joy; all this tyme the trumpettis, the drumes, cannouns, gunes, the displayit cullouris geving honor to these deid corps. From thence all of thame, both hors and fute, convoyit these deid corps to the Abay Kirk of Halyrudhous quhair he is left inclosit in ane yll [aisle] till forder ordour be by his Majestie and Estaites of Parliament for the solempnitie of his Buriall.<ref>{{cite book|author=John Nicoll|title=A Diary of Public Transactions And Other Occurrences, chiefly in Scotland, from January, 1650, to June, 1667|publisher=Bannatyne Club|page=316}}</ref></blockquote>

Montrose's limbs were brought from the towns to which they had been sent (Glasgow, Perth, Stirling and Aberdeen) and placed in his coffin, as he lay in state at Holyrood. A splendid funeral was held in the church of [[St. Giles' Cathedral|St. Giles]] on 11 May 1661.<ref name="Daniel">{{cite book|author=Daniel, William S.|year=1852|title=History of the Abbey and Palace of Holyrood|location=Edinburgh|publisher=Duncan Anderson|pages=123–124}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Chambers|first=Robert|year=1885|title=omestic Annals of Scotland|location=Edinburgh|publisher=Chambers|pages=307}}</ref>

The torso of an executed person would have normally been given to friends or family; but Montrose was the subject of an excommunication, which was why it was originally buried in unconsecrated ground. In 1650 his niece, Lady Napier, had sent men by night to remove his heart. This relic she placed in a steel case made from his sword and placed the whole in a gold filigree box, which had been presented to her family by a [[Doge of Venice]]. The heart in its case was retained by the Napier family for several generations until lost amidst the confusion of the French Revolution.<ref>{{harvnb|Chambers|1885|pp=282–283}}</ref>
