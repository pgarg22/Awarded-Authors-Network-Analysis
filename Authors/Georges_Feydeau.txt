He is remembered for his [[farce]]s, written between 1886 and 1914.

Feydeau was born in Paris to middle-class parents and raised in an artistic and literary environment. From an early age he was fascinated by the theatre, and as a child he wrote his first plays and organised his schoolfellows into a drama group. In his teens he wrote comic [[monologues]] and moved on to writing plays. His first full-length comedy, ''Tailleur pour dames'' (Ladies' Tailor), was well received, but was followed by a string of comparative failures. He gave up writing for a time in the early 1890s and studied the methods of earlier masters of French comedy, particularly [[Eugène Labiche]], [[Alfred Hennequin]] and [[Henri Meilhac]]. With his technique honed, and sometimes in collaboration with a co-author, he wrote sixteen full-length plays between 1892 and 1916, many of which have become staples of the theatrical repertoire in France and abroad. They include ''[[L'Hôtel du libre échange]]'' (The Free Exchange Hotel, 1894), ''[[La Dame de chez Maxim (play)|La Dame de chez Maxim]]'' (The Lady from [[Maxim's]], 1899), ''[[A Flea in Her Ear|La Puce à l'oreille]]'' (A Flea in Her Ear, 1907) and ''[[Occupe-toi d'Amélie!]]'' (Look After Amélie, 1908).

The plays of Feydeau are marked by closely observed characters, with whom his audiences could identify, plunged into fast-moving comic plots of mistaken identity, attempted adultery, split-second timing and a precariously happy ending. After the great success they enjoyed in his lifetime they were neglected after his death, until the 1940s and 1950s, when productions by [[Jean-Louis Barrault]] and the [[Comédie-Française]] led a revival of interest in his works, at first in Paris and subsequently worldwide.

Feydeau's personal life was marred by depression, unsuccessful gambling and divorce. In 1919 his mental condition deteriorated sharply and he spent his final two years in a [[sanatorium]] in Paris. He died there in 1921 at the age of fifty-eight.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Feydeau was born at his parents' house in the Rue de Clichy, Paris, on 8 December 1862.<ref name=g27/> His father, [[Ernest-Aimé Feydeau]], was a businessman and a moderately well-known writer, whose first novel ''Fanny'' (1858) was a ''[[succès de scandale]]'' and earned him some notoriety. It was condemned from the pulpit by the [[François-Nicholas-Madeleine Morlot|Archbishop of Paris]], and consequently sold in large numbers and had to be reprinted; the author dedicated the new edition to the archbishop.<ref>Pronko (1975), p. 6</ref>
[[File:Mme-Ernest-Feydeau-nadar-and-Ernest-Feydeau.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Feydeau's parents, Léocadie and [[Ernest Feydeau|Ernest]]|alt=young white woman and bald, bearded middle aged white man]]
Feydeau's mother was Lodzia Bogaslawa ''née'' Zelewska, known as "Léocadie".<ref>Gidel, p. 23</ref> When she married Ernest Feydeau in 1861, he was a forty-year-old childless widower and she was twenty-one.<ref>Nahmias, p. 8; and Gidel, p. 23</ref> She was a famous beauty, and rumours spread that she was the mistress of the [[Charles de Morny, Duke of Morny|Duc de Morny]] or even the Emperor [[Napoleon III]] and that one of them was the father of Georges, her first child.<ref>Gidel, p. 22; and Esteban, p. 2</ref>{{refn|The Feydeaus had a second child, a daughter, Diane-Valentine, born in 1866.<ref>Gidel, p. 32</ref>|group=n}} In later life Léocadie commented, "How can anyone be stupid enough to believe that a boy as intelligent as Georges is the son of that idiotic emperor!"{{refn|"Comment peut-on être assez bête pour croire qu'un garçon aussi intelligent que Georges est le fils de cet empereur idiot!"<ref name=n14/>|group=n}} She was more equivocal about her relationship with the duke,<ref>Gidel, p. 29</ref> and Feydeau later said that people could think Morny his father if they wanted to.{{refn|"Morny? Soit! Si vous y tenez."<ref name=n14/>|group=n}}

Ernest was a friend of [[Gustave Flaubert]], [[Théophile Gautier]] and [[Alexandre Dumas fils|Alexandre Dumas ''fils'']], and Feydeau grew up in a literary and artistic environment. After being taken to the theatre at the age of six or seven he was so enthusiastic that he started to write a play of his own. His father, impressed, told the family's [[governess]] to let the boy off tuition that day. Feydeau later said that  laziness made him a playwright, once he found he could escape lessons by writing plays.<ref>Pronko (1975), pp. 6–7</ref> He sought out [[Henri Meilhac]], one of the leading dramatists in Paris, and showed him his latest effort. He recalled Meilhac as saying, "My boy, your play is stupid, but it is theatrical. You will be a man of the theatre".{{refn|Mon fils, ta pièce est stupide, mais elle est scénique. Tu seras un homme de théâtre.<ref>Gidel, p. 51</ref>|group=n}}

After the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870 the family left Paris for [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]], and then stayed for some weeks in [[Bad Homburg vor der Höhe|Homburg]].<ref name=g42>Gidel, p. 42</ref> When they returned to Paris in October 1871 the nine-year-old Feydeau, who had so far received only private tuition, was sent to a boarding school.<ref name=g42/> As a pupil he was generally indolent, but devoted time and energy to organising an amateur dramatic group and performing.<ref>Pronko (1982), p. 99</ref> In October 1873 Ernest died and in 1876 Léocadie remarried. Her second husband, nearer her own age than Ernest, was a prominent liberal journalist, [[Henry Fouquier]] (1839–1901) with whom Feydeau got on well.<ref>Gidel, pp. 50–53</ref> In 1879 Feydeau completed his formal education at the [[Lycée Saint-Louis]], and was engaged as a clerk in a law firm.<ref>Gidel, p. 54 and Esteban, p. 4</ref> Still stage-struck, he began writing again. Comic monologues were fashionable in society, and he wrote ''The Rebellious Young Lady'' (''La Petite révoltée''), a humorous monologue in verse, of about seven minutes' duration,<ref>[https://archive.org/details/LaPetiteRevoltee "La Petite revoltée], Internet Archive. Retrieved 31 July 2020</ref> which attracted favourable attention and was taken up by the publisher Ollendorff.<ref>Gidel, p. 58</ref>

===1880s===
[[File:Tailleur-pour-dames-1887.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Colourful theatre poster advertising "Tailleur pour dames"|Poster for 1887 revival of ''Tailleur pour dames'']]
The first of Feydeau's plays to be staged was a one-act [[two-hander]] called ''Par le fenêtre'' (Through the Window) given by the ''Cercle des arts intimes'', an amateur society, in June 1882.<ref>Gidel, p. 61</ref> The biographer [[Henry Gidel]] comments that it was not a representative audience, being composed of friends of society members, but it was nonetheless a test of a sort, and the play was enthusiastically received.<ref name=g61>Gidel, pp. 61–62</ref> The typical Feydeau characters and plot were already in evidence: a shy husband, a domineering wife, mistaken identities, confusion and a happy ending.<ref name=g61/> The first professional presentation of a Feydeau play was in January 1883, when ''Amour et piano'' was given at the [[Éden-Théâtre#Comédie-Parisienne|Théâtre de l'Athénée]].<ref>Pronko (1975), p. 1</ref>  It depicts the confusion when a young lady receives a young gentleman who she thinks is her new piano teacher; he has come to the wrong house and thinks he is calling on a glamorous cocotte.<ref>Esteban, pp. 80–81</ref> ''[[Le Figaro]]'' called it "a very witty fantasy, very agreeably interpreted".<ref>[https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k278462b/f3.item.zoom "Courrier des Théâtres"], ''Le Figaro'', 29 January 1883, p. 3</ref>

After completing his compulsory military service (1883–84) Feydeau was appointed ''secrétaire général'' to the [[Théâtre de la Renaissance]],<ref>Nahmias, p. 17</ref> under the management of his friend [[Fernand Samuel]].<ref name=p100>Pronko (1982), p. 100</ref> In that capacity he successfully pressed for the premiere of [[Henry Becque]]'s ''La Parisienne'' (1885), later recognised as one of the masterpieces of French naturalist theatre.<ref>Pronko (1975), p. 1; and Gidel, p. 74</ref> In December 1886 the Renaissance presented a three-act comédie by Feydeau, ''Tailleur pour dames'' (Tailor for ladies). ''[[Les Annales du théâtre et de la musique]]'' thought the play insubstantial, but, "what gaiety in the dialogue, what good humour, what pleasing words, what fun in this childishness, what unforeseen things in this madness, what comic invention in this imbroglio, which obtained the most outright success one could wish to a beginner!"<ref>Noël and Stoullig (1887), p. 373</ref> The critic of ''Le Figaro'' said that the piece was not a comedy at all in the conventional sense of the word:

{{blockindent|It doesn't look like anything and it looks like everything. It's made of everything, and it's made of nothing. And it is comic, it is funny! I laughed at it from ten o'clock to midnight. I laughed about it throughout the journey from the Renaissance to ''Le Figaro''. And I am still laughing about it.<ref name=f1886>"Intérim".

The critic [[Jules Prével]] correctly predicted that the young author would struggle to repeat this early triumph: it was not until 1892 that Feydeau had another success to match ''Tailleur pour dames''.<ref>Esteban, p. 87</ref> He had a series of poor or mediocre runs in the late 1880s with ''La Lycéenne'' (a vaudeville-opérette with music by [[Gaston Serpette]], 1887), ''[[Chat en poche]]'' (1888),  ''Les Fiancés de Loches'' (1888 co-written with [[Maurice Desvallières]]), and ''L'Affaire Edouard'' (1889).<ref>[https://libretheatre.fr/la-lyceenne-de-georges-feydeau/ "La lycéenne de Georges Feydeau"], Libre Théâtre.

In 1889 Feydeau married Marie-Anne, the daughter of [[Carolus-Duran]], a prosperous portrait painter. The couple had four children, born between 1890 and 1903.{{refn|The four children were Germaine (1890–1941), who married the playwright [[Louis Verneuil]]; Jacques (1892–1970); Michel (1900–1961), father of the actor [[Alain Feydeau]]; and [[Jean-Pierre Feydeau|Jean-Pierre]] (1903–1970), a film director.<ref>Pascal, Nicolas.

Retrieved 2 August 2020</ref>|group=n}} The marriage was ideal to Feydeau in several ways. It was a genuine love-match (though it later went awry);<ref>Gidel, pp. 97–98 and 242</ref> he was an ardent amateur painter, and his father-in-law gave him lessons;<ref>Gidel, pp. 75 and 97</ref> and marriage into a well-to-do family relieved Feydeau of some of the financial problems arising from his succession of theatrical failures and heavy losses on the stock exchange.<ref name=hh>Hacht and Haynes, p. 151</ref>

===1890s===
In 1890 Feydeau took a break from writing and instead made a study of the works of the leading comic playwrights, particularly  [[Eugène Labiche]], [[Alfred Hennequin]] and Meilhac.<ref>Pronko (1982), pp. 103–104</ref> He benefited from his study, and in 1891 wrote two plays that restored his reputation and fortune.<ref name=hh/> He submitted them to the management of the [[Théâtre du Palais-Royal]]. They agreed to stage one of them, ''[[Monsieur chasse!]]'', but turned down the second, ''[[Champignol malgré lui]]'' (another collaboration with Desvallières) as too unbelievable for an audience to accept.<ref name=p100/> After receiving this news from the Palais-Royal, Feydeau met an old friend, Henri Micheau, the owner of the [[Théâtre des Nouveautés#1878–1911 (boulevard des Italiens)|Théâtre des Nouveautés]], who insisted on seeing the rejected script and immediately recognised it as a potential winner. Meyer writes, "He was right. ''Monsieur chasse!'' was a success, but ''Champignol'' was a triumph".<ref name=meyer/> When the play opened in November 1892 one critic wrote of:

Another critic said that it had been  years since he heard such laughter in a Paris theatre – "I could return to it again and again with pleasure".

In 1894 Feydeau collaborated with Desvallières on ''La Ruban'' (The Ribbon), a comedy about a man desperately angling for appointment to the [[Legion of Honour]].<ref>Gidel, pp. 138–139</ref> At around the same time, after a certain amount of angling on his own account,<ref>Gidel, p. 126</ref> Feydeau was appointed to the Legion, at the early age of thirty-two, joining a small élite of French playwrights to be so honoured, including Dumas, Meilhac, [[Ludovic Halévy]], [[Victorien Sardou]] and Becque.<ref>"The Drama in Paris", ''The Era'', 5 January 1895, p. 10</ref>

''La Ruban'' ran at the [[Odéon-Théâtre de l'Europe|Théâtre de l'Odéon]] for 45 performances. Feydeau and Desvallières returned to winning form in the same year with ''[[L'Hôtel du libre échange]]'' (The Free Exchange Hotel). The ''Annales du théâtre et de la musique'', noting that the laughter reverberated inside and out of the auditorium, said that a reviewer could only laugh and applaud rather than criticise.<ref>Noël and Stoullig (1895), pp. 361–362</ref> Another critic, predicting a long run, wrote that he and his colleagues would not be needed at the Nouveautés in their professional capacities for a year or so, but would know where to come if they wanted to laugh.<ref>"L'Hôtel du libre échange", ''The Era'', 8 December 1894, p. 11</ref> The play ran for 371 performances.<ref name=ns95/> An English adaptation, ''The Gay Parisians'', was staged in New York in September 1895, and ran for nearly 150 performances;<ref>"The Theatres", ''The New York Times'', 29 December 1895, p. 12</ref> a London version, ''A Night in Paris'', opened in April 1896 and outran the Parisian original, with a total of 531 performances.<ref>Gaye, p. 1535</ref>

During the rest of the 1890s there were two more Feydeau plays, both highly successful. ''[[Le Dindon]]'' (literally "Turkey" but in French usage signifying "Dupe" or "Fall guy")<ref>[https://www.dictionnaire-academie.fr/article/A9D2544 "Dindon"], Dictionnaire de l'Académie française, 9e édition.

===1900–1909===
The Feydeaus' marriage, happy for its first decade or so, had begun to go wrong by the early years of the 20th century. Feydeau gambled and lost large sums and in 1901 had to sell some of his valuable art collection;{{refn|Feydeau's art collection included, at various times, works by [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]], [[Alfred Sisley|Sisley]], [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Corot]], [[Claude Monet|Monet]], [[Camille Pissarro|Pissaro]], [[Auguste Renoir|Renoir]] and [[Vincent van Gogh|Van Gogh]].<ref>Pronko (1982), p. 102</ref>|group=n}} his wife was said to have become bitter and spendthrift.<ref>Esteban, p. 15</ref> Finance became a continual problem.

''Occupe-toi d'Amélie!'' was the last full-length play Feydeau wrote on his own. ''Le Circuit'' (The Road Race, 1909) with [[Francis de Croisset]] made little impact. ''Je ne trompe pas mon mari'' (I don't cheat on my husband, 1914) with René Peter did well at the box office, with 200 performances, but in the view of Feydeau's biographer [[Leonard Pronko]] it has signs that "the dramatist had almost reached the end of his brilliant inventiveness".<ref>Pronko (1975), p. 187</ref> From 1908 Feydeau focused chiefly on a series of one-act plays, which he envisaged as a set to be called ''From Marriage to Divorce''.

("Hortense says 'I don't give a damn'", 1916) "astringently funny … Feydeau's last dazzling gasp".<ref>Pronko (1975), p. 188</ref>

Feydeau had long been subject to depression, but in mid-1919 his family, alarmed at signs of a severe deterioration in his mental condition, called in medical experts; the diagnosis was [[dementia]] caused by tertiary [[syphilis]].<ref name=g266>Gidel, p. 266</ref> The condition was incurable, and Feydeau's family arranged for him to be admitted to a leading sanatorium in [[Rueil-Malmaison]].<ref name=g266/> He spent his last two years there, imagining himself to be Napoleon{{space}}III, appointing ministers and issuing invitations to his coronation.<ref name=g271/><ref>Esteban, p. 17</ref>{{refn|In one of his lucid moments Feydeau complained that he was incarcerated for saying he was Napoleon III, but that another patient supposed himself to be President of France: the patient ''was'' the President of France, [[Paul Deschanel]].<ref name=g271>Gidel, pp. 271–272</ref>|group=n}}

Between 1878 and 1916 Feydeau completed twenty full-length plays and nineteen one-act ones. Eleven of them were written with a co-author, and not all were farcical; ''Le Ruban'' (The Ribbon, 1894, in collaboration with [[Maurice Desvallières]]), is a comedy about a man's strenuous efforts to be appointed to the [[Legion of Honour]],<ref>[https://libretheatre.fr/le-ruban-de-georges-feydeau/ "Le ruban de Georges Feydeau"], Libre Théâtre.

He said that he made so much money from ''La Dame de chez Maxim'' that he could afford to take two years' break from writing and devote himself instead to his hobby, painting.<ref>Esteban, p. 144</ref> That play remains a favourite with French audiences; in English-speaking countries ''A Flea in Her Ear'' became the most popular.<ref>Pronko (1975), pp. 1 and 13; and Hacht and Hayes, p. 591</ref>

===Farcical style===
The critic S. Beynon John contrasts Feydeau's farce with that of the English theatre of the same period – the latter "cosy and genial", and Feydeau's "sharply subversive". John also contrasts Feydeau with the earlier French farceur, Eugène Labiche: "Labiche's world, though fantasticated, is rooted in ordinary life; Feydeau's is cruel, claustrophobic, and smacks of mania".<ref name=beynon>John, S. Beynon. [https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198661252.001.0001/acref-9780198661252-e-1783 "Feydeau, Georges"],  ''The New Oxford Companion to Literature in French'', Oxford University Press, 1995. Retrieved 30 July 2020 {{subscription}}</ref> Discussing his technique, Feydeau said, "When I sit down to write a play I identify those characters who have every reason to avoid each other; and I make it my business to bring them together as soon, and as often, as I can."<ref name=ox/> He also said that to make people laugh "you have to place ordinary people in a dramatic situation and then observe them from a comic angle, but they must never be allowed to say or do anything which is not strictly demanded, first by their character and secondly by the plot".<ref name=meyer/> Although in private life he was known for his wit,<ref>Esteban, p. 12</ref> he carefully avoided it in his plays, holding that witty theatrical dialogue interrupted the action.<ref>Pronko (1975), p. 41; and Meyer p. 10</ref>{{refn|When preparing the first English version of ''Occupe-toi d'Amélie!'' [[Noël Coward]] commented that only the visual action was funny.<ref>Coward, p. 381</ref> His attempt to inject some wit was regarded by some critics as misguided.<ref>"Coward Play in London; 'Look After Lulu' Opens", ''[[The New York Times]]'', 30 July 1959, p. 20; and Lesley, p. 388</ref> [[John Mortimer]] admitted to adding "a collection of verbal jokes" in his Feydeau translations, but only in the first acts: in the second acts, he said, the action was all-important.<ref name=m11>Mortimer, p. 11</ref>|group=n}}

The critic W. D. Howarth sums up Feydeau's typical dramatic template as "a nightmare sequence of events in otherwise unremarkable lives".<ref name=ox/> In general the vaudeville or farcical events are confined to the second of three acts:<ref name=meyer/>
{{blockindent|A typical plot establishes in Act I the need for secrecy on which the subterfuge and duplicity of the leading characters will depend; in Act II we move to a public meeting place – most notoriously a hotel of not very savoury reputation … Act III restores things to a somewhat precarious status quo.<ref name=ox/>|}}
Howarth observes that "The nightmare quality of Feydeau's middle acts" depends not only on  "frenzied comings and goings", but also on mechanical stage accessories such as the revolving bed in ''La Puce à l'oreille'', which conveys its occupants into the next-door room, seemingly at random.<ref name=ox/>

When Feydeau took a break from writing to study the works of his most successful predecessors, he focused in particular on three playwrights: Labiche, Hennequin and Meilhac.<ref name=p104/> From Labiche he learned the importance of close observation of real-life characters, lending verisimilitude to the most chaotic situations.<ref name=p104/> From Hennequin – who had started as an engineer – Feydeau drew the intricate plotting, described by Pronko as "endless mazes of crisscrossing couples, scurrying from door to door, room to room in every possible and impossible combination".<ref name=p104/> From Meilhac he learned the art of writing polished dialogue, sounding elegant but natural.<ref name=p104/> From these three influences, Feydeau fashioned what Pronko calls "the last great masterpieces of the vaudeville form".<ref name=p104>Pronko (1975), p. 104</ref>

Contemporary opinions of Feydeau covered a wide range. [[Catulle Mendès]] wrote, "I continue to deplore the fact that M. Georges Feydeau uses his truly remarkable talent on plays that will be performed four or five hundred times but that will never be read".<ref name=m11/> For some, his late, misogynistic one-act plays were his finest achievements, comparable with [[August Strindberg|Strindberg]] in their naturalism; Feydeau was seen here as a moralist as well as an entertainer.<ref>Pronko (1982), p. 147</ref> For the authors of ''Les Annales du théâtre et de la musique'', and critics in ''Le Figaro'' his farces were what made him incomparable.<ref name=f1908/><ref name=s385/> Later critics including Gidel, Pronko, [[Marcel Achard]] and [[Kenneth Tynan]] have judged that in his farces Feydeau was second only to [[Molière]] as France's great comic dramatist.<ref>Gidel, p. 276; Pronko (1973), p. 140</ref>

After his death Feydeau's plays were neglected for many years. It was not until the 1940s that major revivals were staged in Paris, after which Feydeau gradually became a staple of the repertory in France and abroad. The [[Comédie-Française]] admitted a Feydeau work to its repertoire for the first time in 1941, with a production of the one-act ''Feu la mère de Madame'', directed by [[Fernand Ledoux]], starring [[Madeleine Renaud]] and [[Pierre Bertin]].<ref>[https://www.lesarchivesduspectacle.net/?IDX_Spectacle=16949 "Feu la mère de Madame"], Les Archives du spectacle.
