'''Margiad Evans''' was the pseudonym of Peggy Eileen Whistler (17 March 1909 – 17 March 1958), an English poet, novelist and illustrator with a lifelong identification with the [[Welsh Marches|Welsh border country]].<ref>Ceridwen Lloyd-Morgan: 'Williams , Peggy Eileen [Margiad Evans] (1909–1958)’. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford: Oxford University Press, May 2010) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/96737, retrieved 1 July 2010].</ref>

==Life and works==
Evans was born Peggy Whistler in [[Uxbridge]], [[Middlesex]], the daughter of Godfrey James Whistler (1866-1936), an insurance clerk. Her affection for the [[Herefordshire]] countryside grew from visits she began to pay in 1918 to an aunt in [[Ross-on-Wye]]. The family moved to nearby [[Bridstow]] in 1921. She was educated in Ross and at [[Hereford College of Arts|Hereford School of Art]].

She took her pen name from her father's mother, whose name was Evans. Her two most famous works are ''Country Dance'' (1932) and her ''Autobiography'' (1943, 2nd e., 1952). ''Country Dance'' (serialized on BBC radio in 2006) was followed by three further novels, ''The Wooden Doctor'' (1933), ''Turf or Stone'' (1934), and ''Creed'' (1936), all set in the countryside of the Welsh Marches. Some of her books were self-illustrated.

Whistler married a Welshman, George Michael Mendus Williams, on 28 October 1940, and they went to live on a farm at [[Llangarron]], near Ross, where her husband worked. There a fifth novel was abandoned in favour of her autobiography. She also published ''Poems from Obscurity'' (1947) and a volume of stories, ''The Old and the Young'' (1948), written while her husband was serving in the army. They moved in 1950 to [[Elkstone]] near [[Gloucester]], where her husband was training to be a teacher. Her discovery that she was [[epileptic]] led to another autobiographical account, ''A Ray of Darkness'' (1952).

The couple moved in 1953 with their daughter Cassandra (born 1951) to [[Hartfield]] in [[Sussex]], where her husband began teaching. However, Evans's health declined and she suffered from homesickness for the Welsh marches. ''The Nightingale Silenced'' (1954) is a moving account of her life after she was diagnosed with a brain tumour. A second volume of poetry, ''A Candle Ahead'' (1956), won a prize from the Welsh committee of the Arts Council a few weeks before she died on 17 March 1958 in [[Tunbridge Wells]], [[Kent]].

Interest in Margiad Evans' work has revived, especially in Wales. There were new editions of ''The Old and the Young'' in 1998, of ''Country Dance'' and ''The Wooden Doctor'' in 2005, and of ''Turf or Stone'' in 2010. A centenary conference took place in [[Aberystwyth]] in 2009.<ref>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/96737, retrieved 1 July 2010].</ref>
