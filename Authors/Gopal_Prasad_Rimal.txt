'''Gopal Prasad Rimal''' (or '''{{lang-ne|गोपाल प्रसाद रिमाल}};  Gopālprasād Rimāl''', 1917–1973) was a [[poet]] from [[Kathmandu]], [[Nepal]]. According to scholar [[Michael Hutt (orientalist)|Michael J. Hutt]], "he is remembered as the first "revolutionary" Nepali poet and the first to reject the use of [[Metre (poetry)|meter]]".<ref name = "hutt">''[http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft729007x1&chunk.id=d0e4387&toc.depth=1&toc.id=d0e4387&brand=ucpress Himalayan Voices: An Introduction to Modern Nepali Literature]'' (Voices from Asia), edited and translated by [[Michael Hutt (orientalist)|Michael J. Hutt]], University of California Press, 1991. p. 73. {{ISBN|9780520910263}}</ref>

== Biography and career ==
His parents were Umakanta Rimal and Aditya Kumari Rimal. His first poem, entitled "Kavi ko Gayan" was published in a monthly magazine, "Sarada".

During Rimal's adolescence, he came under the influence of revolutionaries who were aspiring to overthrow the [[Rana dynasty]]. Rimal began his career as a successful poet in 1930 and as a playwright in 1940. In 1941, after the [[Capital punishment|execution]] of a group of political agitators, including [[Dashrath Chand]], Rimal gathered a group of young poets to protest together by singing hymns, at [[Pashupatinath Temple]] in the mornings, and at the shrine of Shobhā Bhagavatī in the evenings.

Rimal founded a creative organization called "Praja Panchayat" to oppose the Rana rulers and was imprisoned on several occasions for his involvement in the movement.  He played a pivotal role in making the 1950–52 [[Democratic Movement (Nepal)|Democratic Movement]] successful, but became disillusioned, and "felt betrayed by the factional strife."<ref name = "hutt75">''[http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft729007x1&chunk.id=d0e4387&toc.depth=1&toc.id=d0e4387&brand=ucpress Himalayan Voices: An Introduction to Modern Nepali Literature]'' (Voices from Asia), edited and translated by [[Michael Hutt (orientalist)|Michael J. Hutt]], University of California Press, 1991. p. 75. {{ISBN|9780520910263}}</ref>

His dreams of a democratic Nepal shattered, Rimal subsequently lost his mental balance and was sent to an asylum in [[Ranchi district|Ranchi]]. Later, he was brought back to Nepal to spend the rest of his life roaming insane in the streets of Kathmandu. Rimal died in 1973.<ref name = "hutt75" />
