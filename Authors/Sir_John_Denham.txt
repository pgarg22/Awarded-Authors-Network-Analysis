'''Sir John Denham''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (1614 or 1615 – 19 March 1669) was an Anglo-Irish [[poet]] and [[courtier]]. He served as [[Office of Works|Surveyor of the King's Works]] and is buried in [[Westminster Abbey]].<ref>'The Abbey Scientists' Hall, A.R. p12: London; Roger & Robert Nicholson; 1966</ref>

==Early life==
Denham was born in [[Dublin]] to Sir [[John Denham (judge)|John Denham]], [[Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer]], and his second wife Eleanor Moore, daughter of [[Garret Moore, 1st Viscount Moore]] and his wife Mary Colley.  His father was a  native of London; the family later settled at [[Egham]] in [[Surrey]]. His mother  died  in childbirth when 
he  was  about  five  years  old. He was educated at [[Trinity College, Oxford]] and at [[Lincoln's Inn]] in [[London]]. He was  an indifferent student, and was notorious for  heavy [[gambling]],  which was a source of much worry to his father. There is no evidence that he took his  degree at  Trinity.

==Marriages==

He  married firstly  in 1634 Ann Cotton, of a wealthy  [[Gloucestershire]]  family, by whom he  had three children, a son who died young and two daughters who reached adulthood.  He married  secondly  in 1665 Margaret Brooke (1642-1667), daughter of Sir [[William Brooke (MP, died 1643)|William Brooke]]  and  his second wife Penelope Hill, and half-sister of the leading statesman  [[Edward Russell, 1st Earl of Orford]]. His unhappy second marriage  was the cause of much gossip, and Margaret's sudden death in 1667 gave rise to a widespread  suspicion, probably unfounded,  that he had poisoned her.

His first wife came from a wealthy family, but he seems to have run through  her money quickly. His  losses from gambling ran to several thousand pounds, although in the 1630s he made some effort to reform. On his father's death in 1639 he inherited  the family estate at Egham. He proceeded to go on one more gambling spree, and again lost several thousand.

==Civil  War==
In his earlier years Denham suffered for his [[Cavalier|Royalism]]; during the [[English Civil War]], he was appointed [[High Sheriff of Surrey]] (for 1642) and governor of [[Farnham Castle]]. Farnham quickly fell to the Parliamentary forces and Denham was sent a prisoner to [[London]], but was soon released. He spent the next five years in [[Oxford]], where he enjoyed the  trust and confidence of [[King Charles I of England|Charles I]].  During the abortive peace negotiations of 1646, Parliament listed him as one of those who must be excluded from the King's counsels. In 1648 he joined the Court in exile, and spent the next four years abroad. He returned to England in 1652 to find that his lands had been sold; for a time  he was almost penniless, until he  acquired the protection of [[Philip Herbert, 5th Earl of Pembroke]]. The authorities, worried by his frequent visits to London, ordered him to  choose a residence more than twenty miles from the capital, which he was not to leave. He settled at [[Bury St. Edmunds]].

[[John Aubrey]] recorded a story of this period which reflects well on Denham's wit and generosity of spirit:<blockquote>“In the time of the civill warres, [[George Wither]]s, the poet, begged Sir John Denham's estate at [[Egham]] of the [[Roundhead|Parliament]], in whose cause he was a captaine of horse. It happened that G. W. was taken prisoner, and was in danger of his life, having written severely against the [[Charles I of England|king]], &c. Sir John Denham went to the king, and desired his majestie not to hang him, for that whilest G. W. lived he should not be the worst poet in England.”<ref>John Aubrey, [https://archive.org/details/brieflives01clargoog ''Brief Lives''] (ed. Andrew Clark), Volume I (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1898), at page 221</ref></blockquote>

==After 1660==
Denham became a [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Old Sarum (UK Parliament constituency)|Old Sarum]] in 1661, became a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] on 20 May 1663, and became a [[Order of the Bath|Knight of the Bath]].  He received substantial grants of land in compensation for his forfeited estates. He built or commissioned the original  [[Burlington House]] in [[Piccadilly]] in about 1665.

After the Restoration Denham became [[Office of Works|Surveyor of the King's Works]], probably due to  his earlier political services rather than for any aptitude as an [[architect]]. [[John Webb (architect)|John Webb]], who, as [[Inigo Jones]]'s deputy  undoubtedly had the competence to have served in the post, complained that  "though Mr. Denham may, as most gentry, have some knowledge of the theory of architecture, he can have none of the practice and must employ another."<ref>Quoted in [[Howard Colvin]], ''A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects, 1600-1840'', 3rd ed. (Yale University Press), 1995, ''s.v.'' "Denham, Sir John;" Denham has a brief entry ''ex officio''.</ref> There is no evidence that he personally designed any buildings, although he seems to have been a competent administrator; he may however have played some part in the design of his own home, Burlington House. John Webb was appointed Denham's deputy by 1664 and did Denham's work at [[Greenwich Palace|Greenwich]] (from 1666) and elsewhere.

===Second marriage  to Margaret  Brooke===

Denham in 1665 made an unhappy second marriage to Margaret Brooke, a beautiful young woman  almost  thirty years his junior,  who conducted a very public affair with the future King [[James II]]. To her husband's mortification, she insisted on being acknowledged publicly as a Royal mistress, saying that she would not, unlike her predecessor  Goditha Price (daughter of Sir [[Herbert Price]], the [[Master of the Household]]), "go up and down the back stairs, but would be owned publicly".<ref>''Diary of Samuel Pepys'' 10 June 1666</ref> When  she died  in January 1667 after a short illness, Denham was rumoured, by [[Samuel Pepys]] among others,  to have murdered her by giving her a poisoned cup of [[chocolate]], although the [[autopsy]] found no trace of [[poison]] , and she had  been seriously ill the previous year.  In any case rumour named several other possible poisoners, including  James,  his wife  [[Anne Hyde]] and  his sister-in-law, Lady Rochester.<ref>''Diary of Samuel Pepys''  10 November 1666,  7 January 1667</ref>

===Last years, death, and children===

His last years were clouded by [[dementia]]. He had long been rumoured to be insane, a condition generally attributed to his scandalous marriage, and later the hostility of the London public, which regarded him as a murderer, and he became a virtual recluse. With Denham's increasing mental incapacity, Charles II requested in March 1669 that [[Christopher Wren]] be appointed Denham's "sole deputy"; Wren succeeded him as King's Surveyor upon his death two weeks later. Denham was buried in [[Poets' Corner]] of [[Westminster Abbey]]. The public suspicion  about  his role in his wife' death had  continued  to the end of his life. He was survived by his daughters, Elizabeth, who married Sir Thomas Arden Price in 1675 but died childless, and Anne, who married Sir William Morley of Halnaker, by whom she had two  sons  who  died  young  and a daughter Mary, who married [[James Stanley, 10th Earl of Derby]], but had no surviving issue.

==Works==
Denham began his literary career with a tragedy, ''[[The Sophy]]'' (1641), but his poem, ''[[s:Coopers-hill: A Poem|Cooper's Hill]]'' (1642), is the work by which he is remembered. It is the first example in English of a poem devoted to local description, picturing the [[Thames Valley]] scenery round his home at [[Egham]] in [[Surrey]]. Denham wrote many versions of this poem, reflecting the political and cultural upheavals of the Civil War.

Gilfillan wrote of Denham and his contemporary Edmund Waller: "Neither Denham nor Waller were great poets; but they have produced lines and verses so good, and have, besides, exerted an influence so considerable on modern versification, and the style of poetical utterance, that they are entitled to a highly respectable place amidst the sons of British song."<ref>[https://archive.org/details/poeticalworksed00wallgoog George Gilfillan, "Life of Sir John Denham", in ''The Poetical Works of Edmund Waller and Sir John Denham'', ed. George Gilfillan (Edinburgh: James Nichol, 1857), p. 203.]</ref>

He also received extravagant praise from [[Samuel Johnson]], who quoted Denham's verse to exemplify the use of several words;<ref>Allen Reddick, ''The Making of Johnson’s Dictionary 1746-1773'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), p. 166.</ref> but the place now assigned him is more humble.
