'''Charles Hubert Sisson''', [[Order of the Companions of Honour|CH]] (22 April 1914 – 5 September 2003), usually cited as '''C. H. Sisson''', was a British writer, best known as a poet and translator.

==Life==
Born in Bristol in 1914, C. H. Sisson was noted as a poet, novelist, essayist and an important translator. He was a great friend of the critic and writer [[Donald Davie]], with whom he corresponded regularly.<ref>Schmidt, Michael: ''Lives of the Poets'',  749. Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2007.</ref>

Sisson's parents were Richard Percy Sisson and Ellen Minnie Sisson (née Worlock). He was educated at the [[University of Bristol]] where he read English and Philosophy, and in France and Germany.<ref name="Who's Who 1974">''Who's Who, 1974'', London : A. & C. Black, 1974, p. 3016)</ref> As a poet he first came to light through the London Arts Review, [[X (magazine)|''X'']],<ref>[[Michael Schmidt (poet)|Michael Schmidt]] (founder of [[Carcanet Press]], editor of [[Poetry Nation Review]] and Professor of Poetry at the [[University of Glasgow]]) writing in [[The Guardian]] in 2006 [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jul/15/featuresreviews.guardianreview1]</ref> founded by the painter [[Patrick Swift]] and the poet [[David Wright (poet)|David Wright]]. He reacted against the prevailing intellectual climate of the 1930s, particularly the [[Auden Group]], preferring to go back to the anti-romantic [[T. E. Hulme]], and to the [[Anglican]] tradition. The modernism of his poetry follows a 'distinct genealogy' from Hulme to Eliot, Pound, Ford Madox Ford and Wyndham Lewis.<ref>Schmidt, Michael: ''Lives of the Poets'', p754. Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2007.</ref> His novel ''Christopher Homm'' experiments with form and is told backwards.

Sisson entered the Ministry of Labour as Principal Assistant in 1936. During the Second World War he served in the British Army, in the ranks, in India (1942–45).<ref name="Who's Who 1974"/> He was Simon Senior Research Fellow (1956–57), Director of Establishments, Ministry of Labour (1962–68), and Director of Occupational Safety and Health, Ministry of Employment (1972).<ref name="Who's Who 1974"/> 1972 was also the year of his retirement from the Civil Service, with the rank of Under-Secretary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1440839/C-H-Sisson.html|title = C H Sisson}}</ref> A standard text, ''The Spirit of British Administration'' (1959), was the product of his Simon Senior Research Fellowship;<ref>E.W. Bard, ''Public Administration Review'', 20, No. 3, 1960 : p.171</ref> it contains the main fruit of his reflection on the British Civil Service. The work notably compares British with French, (then West) German, Swedish, Austrian, and Spanish administrative methods; Sisson sees the British Civil Service as emerging favourably from the comparison.<ref>Steven Muller, ''Administrative Science Quarterly, 5, No. 1, 1960 : pp.169-72</ref> Only slight and negative mention is made of the United States of America.<ref>Steven Muller, ''Administrative Science Quarterly, 5, No. 1, 1960 : p.171.</ref> Sisson was no blind admirer of British methods, however. He was a 'severe critic of the British Civil Service and some of his essays caused controversy'.<ref>Schmidt, Michael: ''Lives of the Poets'', p 750. Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2007.</ref> In his collection ''The London Zoo'' he writes this epitaph 'Here lies a civil servant. He was civil/ To everyone, and servant to the devil.'<ref>Schmidt, Michael: ''Lives of the Poets'', p. Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2007.</ref>

Sisson was married, in 1937, to Nora Gilbertson (d. 2003) and they had two daughters.<ref Name="Obit">{{cite news |last= Davie |first= Donald |date= 9 September 2003 |title= Obituary: CH Sisson |url= https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/sep/09/guardianobituaries.obituaries |work= The Guardian |access-date= 4 April 2020}}</ref> In 1993 C.H. Sisson was appointed a [[Companion of Honour]] for his services to Literature.

Sisson died on 5 September 2003, aged 89.<ref Name="Obit"/>
