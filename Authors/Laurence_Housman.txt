'''Laurence Housman''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|aʊ|s|m|ən}}; 18 July 1865 – 20 February 1959) was an English playwright, writer and illustrator during the Victorian era. He studied art in London. He was a younger brother of the poet [[A. E. Housman]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Laurence-Housman |title=Laurence Housman |website=Britannica |access-date=March 13, 2021}}</ref>

==Early life==
Laurence Housman was born in [[Bromsgrove]], Worcestershire, one of seven children including an older brother and sister, the classical scholar and poet [[A. E. Housman]] and the writer [[Clemence Housman]]. In 1871 his mother died, and his father remarried, to a cousin.  After education at [[Bromsgrove School]], he went with his sister Clemence<!-- followed her? --> to study art at the [[Lambeth School of Art]] and the [[Royal College of Art]] in London.

==Illustrating==
He first worked with London publishers by illustrating such works as [[George Meredith]]'s ''Jump to Glory Jane'' (1892), [[Jonas Lie (writer)|Jonas Lie]]'s ''Weird Tales'' (1892), [[Christina Rossetti]]'s ''[[Goblin Market]]'' (1893), [[Jane Barlow]]'s ''The End of Elfintown'' (1894) and his sister's novella ''The Were-Wolf'' (1896)<ref name="eb1911">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Housman, Laurence}}</ref><ref>http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000479417.</ref> in an intricate [[Art Nouveau]] style. During this period, he also wrote and published several volumes of poetry and a number of [[hymn]]s and [[Carol (music)|carols]].<ref name=hymns>{{cite web|url=http://www.streetsociety.org/housman/hymns.html |title=''Hymns and Carols by Laurence Housman'' |access-date=28 December 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121005340/http://www.streetsociety.org/housman/hymns.html |archive-date=21 November 2008 }}</ref>

==Writing==

[[File:William Rothenstein - portrait of Laurence Housman -.jpg|thumb|Undated portrait by [[William Rothenstein]] (1872–1945)]]

Housman turned more and more to writing after his eyesight began to fail. 
His first literary success came with the novel ''[[An Englishwoman's Love-letters]]'' (1900), published anonymously. He then turned to drama with ''Bethlehem'' (1902) and was to become best known and remembered as a playwright. His other dramatic works include ''Angels and Ministers''<ref name=gutang>{{gutenberg|no=11020|name=Angels & Ministers}}</ref> (1921), ''Little Plays of St. Francis'' (1922) and ''[[Victoria Regina (play)|Victoria Regina]]'' (1934) which was even staged on Broadway. Housman's play, ''Pains and Penalties'', about Queen Caroline, was produced by [[Edith Craig]] and the Pioneer Players.<ref name=Pioneer>Cockin, Katharine. ''Women and Theatre in the Age of Suffrage: The Pioneer Players 1911–25'', Palgrave (2001)</ref>

Some of Housman's plays were scandalous for depicting [[biblical]] characters and living members of the [[Royal House]] on stage, and many of them were performed only privately until the subsequent relaxation of theatrical censorship. In 1937 the [[Lord Chamberlain]] ruled that no British sovereign may be portrayed on the stage until 100 years after his or her accession. For this reason, ''Victoria Regina'' could not be staged until the centenary of [[Queen Victoria]]'s accession, 20 June 1937. This was a Sunday, so the premiere took place the next day.<ref>''All the Best People ...: The Pick of Peterborough 1929–1945'', George Allen & Unwin, 1981; p. 139</ref>

Housman also wrote children's [[fairy tales]] such as ''A Farm in Fairyland'' (1894) and fantasy stories with Christian undertones for adults, such as ''All-Fellows'' (1896), ''The Cloak of Friendship'' (1905), and ''Gods and Their Makers'' (1897).
<ref>"Housman, Laurence" in [[Brian Stableford|Stableford, Brian]] (2005). ''The A to Z of Fantasy Literature'' (Scarecrow Press, 2005)
(p.205).</ref>

A prolific writer with around a hundred published works to his name, his output eventually covered all kinds of literature from socialist and pacifist pamphlets to children's stories. He wrote an autobiography, ''The Unexpected Years'' (1937), which, despite his record of controversial writing, said little about his homosexuality, the practice of which was then illegal.<ref name=knitting>{{cite web |url=http://www.knittingcircle.org.uk/laurencehousman.html  |title=Laurence Housman |work=Knitting Circle |access-date=6 August 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080205235400/http://www.knittingcircle.org.uk/laurencehousman.html |archive-date = 5 February 2008}}</ref>

After his brother's A.E.'s death in 1936, Laurence was made literary executor, and over the next two years brought out further selections of poems from his brother's manuscripts. His editorial work has been deprecated recently: "The text of many poems was misrepresented: poems not completed by Housman were printed as though complete; versions he cancelled were reinstated; separate texts were conflated; and many poems were mistranscribed from the manuscripts."<ref>Archie Burnett, notes to ''A Shropshire Lad and Other Poems'', Penguin 2010, [https://books.google.com/books?id=qsQ9Nw0fJr4C&lpg=RA3-PR31-IA1&ots=Up4O6ONOH6&dq=More%20Poems%20%20Housman&pg=RA3-PR31-IA1#v=onepage&q=More%20Poems%20%20Housman&f=true p.xxxi].</ref>

==Activism==
Laurence Housman has contributed himself as a [[Feminism|feminist]], dedicating his work mainly to the [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|Suffrage movement in England]]. His activism was mainly creating works of art such as: creating banners, creating [[propaganda]], writings and contributing to women's newspapers.

=== The Suffrage Atelier ===
[[File:What a woman may be and yet not have the vote. Suffrage Atelier. (16051439552).jpg|thumb|A poster from the Suffrage Atelier, 1913]]
Laurence Housman and his sister, [[Clemence Housman]], founded the [[Suffrage Atelier]] in February 1909.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Liddington|first=Jill|title=Vanishing for the Vote : Suffrage, Citizenship and the Battle for the Census|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2014|location=Manchester, UK}}</ref> This was a studio that produced artistic [[propaganda]] for the [[Women's suffrage|suffrage movement]]. The studio was located at his house, No. 1 Pembroke Cottage Kensington.<ref name=":12">{{Cite journal|last=Morton|first=Tara|date=2012-09-01|title=Changing Spaces: art, politics, and identity in the home studios of the Suffrage Atelier|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/09612025.2012.658177|journal=Women's History Review|volume=21|issue=4|pages=623–637|doi=10.1080/09612025.2012.658177|s2cid=144118253|issn=0961-2025}}</ref> Although there were other studios throughout England also creating propaganda for the suffrage movement such as the [[Artists' Suffrage League|Artists’ Suffrage League]] and the [[Women's Social and Political Union|Women’s Social and Political Union]], the Suffrage Atelier was unique because this studio paid their artist by selling the work to the suffrage community.<ref name=":12"/> This studio was important not only in creating propaganda for the suffrage movement but also, the creation of banners required collective work. This was significant as it created an environment for women to find other women.<ref name=":12"/> Additionally, work such as embroidery, which was known to be domestic, was utilized to propel a political movement and allowed women to earn money.<ref name=":12"/>

=== No. 1 Pembroke Cottage Kensington ===
Aside from his [[Suffrage Atelier]] studio, Housman opened his house to the suffrage movement and it quickly became a hub for the feminist movement.<ref name=":12"/> Along with housing the Suffrage Atelier studio, it additionally held educational classes trying to help women explore their feminist identities.<ref name=":12"/> This was done by bringing in public speakers and hosting writing lessons.<ref name=":12"/>

=== The Census Protest ===
The 1911 Census Boycott was a feminist movement with the goal of disrupting government processes.<ref name=":6">{{Cite book|last=Paxton|first=Naomi|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvnb7rqg|title=Stage rights!: The Actresses' Franchise League, activism and politics 1908–58|date=2018|publisher=Manchester University Press|jstor=j.ctvnb7rqg|edition=1}}</ref> Advertised by the Suffrage Press, the movement asked women to refuse giving their information for the census.<ref name=":6" /> Housman was one of the main contributor in the 1911 Census Boycott. His contribution was through publishing propaganda for the boycott.<ref name=":7">{{Cite journal|last1=Liddington|first1=Jill|last2=Crawford|first2=Elizabeth|last3=Maund|first3=E.

=== ''The Anti-Suffrage Alphabet'' ===
''The Anti-Suffrage Alphabet'' was a book including illustrations from Housman and other women<ref name=":2">{{Citation|last1=Tyson|first1=Leonora|title=An early supporter of women's rights|date=2015|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1g69xrh.58|work=Treasures from UCL|pages=172–175|edition=1|publisher=UCL Press|isbn=978-1-910634-01-1|access-date=2020-11-24|last2=Frederick|last3=Lawrence|first3=Emmeline Pethick|last4=Furlong|first4=Gillian|jstor=j.ctt1g69xrh.58}}</ref> which worked to raise funds for the suffrage campaign.<ref>{{Cite web|title=An Anti-Suffrage Alphabet book - Housman, Laurence|url=https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/an-anti-suffrage-alphabet-book-housman-laurence/igF9dyIeRyd4lQ|access-date=2020-11-24|website=Google Arts & Culture|language=en}}</ref> The main goal of the book was to disenfranchise women’s subordination by criticizing the negative attitudes towards women.<ref name=":2" />

=== "From Prison to Citizenship" ===
"From Prison to Citizenship" was the first banner created by Housman as a contribution to the [[Women's Social and Political Union|Women’s Social and Political Union]].<ref name=":0" /> This banner was displayed at the Queen’s hall at an unveiling ceremony and has been used regularly by the [[Women's Social and Political Union|Women’s Social and Political Union]].<ref name=":0" />

=== His writing ===
Housman was a writer hence, his passion has always been writing. Therefore, he tried to incorporate this in his work with the feminist movement. He was popular for taking other people’s work and giving it a feminist twist.<ref name=":0" /> In addition, he contributed to newspapers. Through his contributions to newspapers, he was able to advise women on how to protest which can be found in the ''[[Women's Freedom League|Women’s Freedom League]].''<ref name=":82">{{Citation|last1=Tyson|first1=Leonora|title=An early supporter of women's rights|date=2015|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1g69xrh.58|work=Treasures from UCL|pages=172–175|edition=1|publisher=UCL Press|isbn=978-1-910634-01-1|access-date=2020-11-25|last2=Frederick|last3=Lawrence|first3=Emmeline Pethick|last4=Furlong|first4=Gillian|jstor=j.ctt1g69xrh.58}}</ref> In addition, he featured his writing in newspapers. For example, a series of poems supporting the Suffragette movement was published in [[The Women's Press|''The Women’s Press'']] as well as ''[[Votes for Women (newspaper)|Votes for Women]]''.<ref name=":82"/>

=== Creating propaganda ===
Housman predominantly contributed to the suffrage movement by creating [[propaganda]]. Recently, propaganda has been perceived pejoratively because of its association with negative entities such as, totalitarian governments and war efforts;<ref name="Ross 2002 16–30">{{Cite journal|last=Ross|first=Sheryl Tuttle|date=2002|title=Understanding Propaganda: The Epistemic Merit Model and Its Application to Art|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3333623|journal=Journal of Aesthetic Education|volume=36|issue=1|pages=16–30|doi=10.2307/3333623|jstor=3333623|issn=0021-8510}}</ref> however, the definition of propaganda is merely spreading ideas to further a cause.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Mull|first1=Christian|last2=Wallin|first2=Matthew|date=2013|title=Propaganda:: A Tool of Strategic Influence |journal=American Security Project |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/resrep06038}}</ref> Propaganda is effective because it triggers an emotional response<ref name="Ross 2002 16–30"/> and this is powerful because it can overwhelm people's emotions to the extent that they forget to think rationally.<ref name=":11">{{Cite journal|last=Maitra|first=Ishani|date=2016|title=Propaganda, Non-Rational Means, and Civic Rhetoric|journal=Theoria |volume=31|issue=3|pages=313–327|doi=10.1387/theoria.16859|jstor=43974640|issn=0495-4548|doi-access=free}}</ref> However, sometimes, propaganda can rely on people's reasons. In this case, propaganda heightens the emotions that people had already rationally concluded.<ref name=":11" /> If the audience is unaware of the intent of the propaganda, the impact or the emotional response that the artist desired to create becomes magnified.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Collier|first=Rex Madison|date=1944-08-01|title=The Effect of Propaganda upon Attitude Following a Critical Examination of the Propaganda Itself|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/00224545.1944.9918827|journal=The Journal of Social Psychology|volume=20|issue=1|pages=3–17|doi=10.1080/00224545.1944.9918827|issn=0022-4545}}</ref> Additionally, the power of propaganda becomes more powerful when the same message is repeated.<ref name=":10">{{Cite journal|last=Kassab|first=Madeleine|date=2020|title=Propaganda; the Strongest Weapon|url=https://orbi.uliege.be/handle/2268/246984|journal=Al Kitab Journal for Human Sciences|language=en|volume=2|issue=4|hdl=2268/246984}}</ref> The repetition can be the dispersion of a message through different media outlets such as newspapers, radios, art and literature.<ref name=":10" /> Housman partook in the suffrage movement by taking advantage of this powerful medium and utilized multiple different outlets to spread his propaganda such as, creating banners with the [[Suffrage Atelier]],<ref name=":12"/> creating the Anti-Suffrage Alphabet, and writing in newspapers.<ref name=":82"/>

=== Other activism ===
Aside from his artistic contributions, he also participated in physical protests. He frequently spoke in suffrage rallies. Similar to his writing style, he spoke artistically. For example, he read  [[Tommy (Kipling poem)|“Tommy this Tommy that” by Rudyard Kipling]] to be “Women this Women that”.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|last=Denisoff-1 Kooistra-2|first=Dennis-1 Lorraine-2|date=2010|title=Laurence Housman|url=http://www.1890s.ca/PDFs/housman_bio.pdf|website=the yellow nineties online}}</ref> He also took part in handing in a petition against [[force feeding]], and was arrested during associated disturbances.<ref>{{Cite news|date=25 February 1914|title=L.

=== His economic belief and its contribution to gender oppression ===
Housman thought economics was a central component working to oppress women. He believed the Suffragettes perceived masculinity to value market values while feminine values leaned to be more utopian and reflect collective values.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last=Mayhall|first=Laura E. Nym|date=2001-04-01|title=Household and Market in Suffragette Discourse, 1903—14|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/10848770120031378|journal=The European Legacy|volume=6|issue=2|pages=189–199|doi=10.1080/10848770120031378|issn=1084-8770|pmid=18389562|s2cid=28910155}}</ref> The Suffrage movement, therefore, centred maternal values, de-individualizing the movement.<ref name=":3" /> This, was important as it helped break the stereotype that women, especially mothers, who were active in the movement, were bad citizens.<ref name=":3" />  Put differently, it collectivized the issue and made the reason to be a Suffragette more valid.

=== His sexuality ===
Housman was openly homosexual and invested himself to help other homosexuals to be less stigmatized by society. To do so, he joined an organization called the [[Order of Chaeronea]] which was a secret society that worked to gain homosexuals social recognition.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Doussot|first=Audrey|date=2011-03-30|title=Laurence Housman (1865–1959): Fairy Tale Teller, Illustrator and Aesthete|url=http://journals.openedition.org/cve/2190|journal=Cahiers victoriens et édouardiens|language=en|issue=73 Printemps|pages=131–146|doi=10.4000/cve.2190|issn=0220-5610|doi-access=free}}</ref> Additionally, he also was a founder of the [[British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology]].<ref name=":4" /> This was an organization which aimed to advance sex reform hoping for a more open society regarding sexualities by breaking prejudices.<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Lesley A.|date=1995|title='Disinterested Enthusiasm for Sexual Misconduct': The British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology, 1913-47|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/261087|journal=Journal of Contemporary History|volume=30|issue=4|pages=665–686|doi=10.1177/002200949503000405|jstor=261087|s2cid=162262939|issn=0022-0094}}</ref> It was originally known as the British Society of Psychiatry; however, Housman wanted it known as a society and had it changed.<ref name=":5" /> Housman also brought his artistic contributions to the fight of de-stigmatizing homosexuality. For example, he created pamphlets for the organization such as ''The Relation of Fellow-Feeling to Sex''.<ref name=":5" />

=== Men’s League for Women’s Suffrage ===
[[File:Men's_League_for_Women's_Suffrage.jpg|thumb|A newspaper published by the Men's League for Women's Suffrage in October 1909]]
Housman believed men should be an active participant of the suffrage movement. Therefore, Housman along with [[Israel Zangwill]], [[Henry Nevinson]] and [[H. N. Brailsford|Henry Brailsford]] formed the [[Men's League for Women's Suffrage (United Kingdom)|Men’s League for Women’s Suffrage]] to propel the movement.<ref name=":9">{{Cite book|last=Rosenberg|first=David|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvfp63cf|title=Rebel Footprints: A Guide to Uncovering London's Radical History|date=2019|publisher=Pluto Press|jstor=j.ctvfp63cf|isbn=978-0-7453-3855-2|edition=2}}</ref> These four writers were able to successfully convince some men in the 1910 general election to write Vote for Women on their ballot.<ref name=":9" /> He was also active in another male feminist group, the Men’s Social and Political Union.<ref name=":4" />[[File:Dedication by Laurence Housman in WSPU scrapbook.png|thumb|Dedication by Laurence Housman in Mabel Cappers' WSPU prisoners' scrapbook October 1910|left|upright=1.15]]

=== Peace Pledge Union ===
In 1945 he opened Housmans Bookshop in Shaftesbury Avenue, London, founded in his honour by the [[Peace Pledge Union]], of which he was a sponsor. In 1959, shortly after his death, the shop moved to Caledonian Road, where it is still a source of literature on pacifism and other radical approaches to living.<ref>Tom Willis and Emily Johns, "The man who made it all possible",
