==Biography==
[[File:Bahriyeli Necip Fazıl.jpg|thumb|185px|right|Necip Fazıl in 1916]]
In his own words, he was born in "a huge mansion in [[Çemberlitaş, Fatih|Çemberlitaş]], on one of the streets descending towards [[Sultanahmet, Fatih|Sultanahmet]]" in 1904. His father was Abdülbaki Fazıl Bey who held several posts including deputy judge in Bursa, public prosecutor in Gebze and finally, judge in Kadıköy. His mother was an emigree from [[Crete]]. He was raised at the Çemberlitaş mansion of his paternal grandfather Kısakürekzade Mehmed Hilmi Efendi of Maraş; he was named after his great-grandfather Ahmed Necib, as well as his father, Fazıl.

He studied in many schools during his primary education, including the French School in Gedikpaşa, [[Robert College]] of [[Istanbul]], as well as the Naval School. He received religious courses from Ahmed Hamdi of Akseki and science courses from Yahya Kemal at the Naval School but he was actually influenced by İbrahim Aşkî, whom he defined to have "penetrated into deep and private areas in many inner and outer sciences from literature and philosophy to mathematics and physics". İbrahim Aşkî provided his first contact with Sufism even at a "plan of skin over skin". "After completing candidate and combat classes" of Naval School, Kısakürek entered the Philosophy Department of [[Istanbul University|Darülfünûn]] and graduated from there (1921–1924). One of his closest friends in philosophy was [[Hasan Ali Yücel]].

He studied in [[Paris]] for one year with the [[scholarship]] provided by the Ministry of National Education (1924–1925), until the scholarship was cancelled. After returning home in 1926, he worked at Holland, [[Ottoman Bank|Osmanlı]] and [[Türkiye İş Bankası|İş Banks]] (1926–1939), and gave lectures at the Faculty of Linguistics and History and Geography and the State Conservatoire in [[Ankara]] and the Academy of Fine Arts in İstanbul (1939–1942). Having established a relation with the press in his youth, Kısakürek quit civil service to earn his living from writing and magazines.

Necip Fazıl's life took a turn in 1934, when he met [[Abdülhakim Arvasi]], a sheik of the [[Sufi]] [[Naqshbandi]] order. He became one of his most notable disciples,<ref>{{cite book |title=The State and the Subaltern: Modernization, Society and the State in Turkey and Iran |url=https://archive.org/details/statesubalternmo00atab |url-access=limited |editor-first=Touraj |editor-last=Atabaki |publisher=I.

Appropriating his anti-semitic ideas from Europe, Kısakürek regarded Jews as the corrupting element within Western civilization, and described them as the originator of [[Marxism]] and [[capitalism]].<ref name="competing"/> He held them responsible for the early conflicts between Muslims and the decline of the Ottoman Empire.<ref name="muse"/> Kısakürek's publications included the Turkish translation of [[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]] and praise for Henry Ford's [[The International Jew]], as well as a political program in which he wrote: “Chief among these treacherous and insidious elements to be cleansed are the Dönmes and the Jews."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kısakürek|first1=Necip Fazıl|title=Ideolocya örgüsü|date=1968|publisher=Büyük Doğu Yayınları|location=İstanbul|isbn=9789758180325|pages=71|edition=10. basım.}}</ref><ref>[[Marc David Baer]].

Play Contest in 1947 with his play Sabır Taşı (Stone of Patience). Kısakürek was awarded the titles of "Great Cultural Gift" by the Ministry of Culture (25 May 1980) and "Greatest Living Poet of Turkish" by the [[Foundation of Turkish Literature]] upon the 75th anniversary of his birth.

Necip Fazıl Kısakürek died on 25 May 1983 in his house at Erenköy after an illness that "lasted long but did not impair his intellectual activity and writing" and was buried in the graveyard at the [[Eyüp Cemetery]] on the ridge of Eyüp after an eventful funeral.

==Islamist nationalist ideology==
Kısakürek sought to replace the [[Kemalism|Kemalist]] [[Secularism in Turkey|secular]] notion of nationalism with an [[Islamist]] one. Within Turkish Islamism, he represented the concept of "Islamization from above" through the capture of government.<ref>{{cite book |title=Secular and Islamic Politics in Turkey: The Making of the Justice and Development Party |url=https://archive.org/details/secularislamicpo00cizr |url-access=limited |editor-first=Ümit |editor-last=Cizre |publisher=Routledge |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-134-15522-4 |author-first1=Çınar |author-last1=Menderes |author-first2=Duran |author-last2=Burhanettin |author-link2=Burhanettin Duran |chapter=The specific evolution of contemporary political Islam in Turkey and its 'difference' |pages=[https://archive.org/details/secularislamicpo00cizr/page/n34 28], 34}}</ref>

Since the late 1970s, Kısakürek has been an icon for Turkish Islamists.<ref>{{cite book |title=Global Shaping and Its Alternatives |editor-first1=Yıldız |editor-last1=Atasoy |editor-first2=William K. |editor-last2=Carroll |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-55193-043-5 |author-first=Yıldız |author-last=Atasoy |chapter=Explaining local-global nexus: Muslim politics in Turkey |page=68}}</ref> Many cadres of the [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP) have been inspired by his rhetoric,<ref>{{cite book |title=Antagonistic Tolerance: Competitive Sharing of Religious Sites and Spaces |author=Robert M.

==Literary career==
In his own words, having "learned to read and to write from his grandfather in very young ages", Kısakürek became "crazy about limitless, trivia reading" until the age of twelve starting from "groups of sentences belonging to lower class writers of the [[French language|French]]" Having been involved in literature with such a reading passion, Necip Fazıl states that his "poetry started at the age of twelve" and that his mother said "how much I would like you to be a poet" by showing the "poetry notebook of a girl with tuberculosis" lying on the bed next to his mother's bed when he went to visit her staying at the hospital, and adds: "My mother's wish appeared to me as something that I fed inside but I was not aware of until twelve. The motive of existence itself. I decided inside with my eyes on the snow hurling on the window of the hospital room and the wind howling; I will be a poet! And I became".

The first published poem of Necip Fazıl is "''Kitabe''", a poem that was later included in his book ''Örümcek Ağı'' (Spider Web) with the title "''Bir Mezar Taşı''"(A Gravestone); it was also published in the ''Yeni Mecmua'' (New Magazine) dated 1 July 1923.

By 1939, his poems and articles were appearing in magazines such as Yeni Mecmua, Milli Mecmua, Anadolu, Hayat and Varlık, and Cumhuriyet newspaper.

After returning home from Paris in 1925, Necip Fazıl stayed in Ankara intermittently. On his third visit, he published a magazine called ''Ağaç'' on 14 March 1936 by providing the support of some banks. ''Ağaç'', the writers of which included Ahmet Hamdi Tanpınar, Ahmet Kutsi Tecer and Mustafa Şekip Tunç, decided to follow a spiritualist and idealist line on the contrary to the materialist and Marxian ideas supported by the writers such as Burhan Belge, Vedat Nedim Tör, Şevket Süreyya Aydemir and İsmail Hüsrev Tökin of closed ''[[Kadro]]'' magazine owned by Yakup Kadri and which influenced the intellectuals of the time greatly. Kısakürek later transferred to ''Ağaç'' (Tree) magazine published during six volumes in Ankara to İstanbul, however, unable to establish a viable reader base, the magazine was closed at the 17th volume.

Necip Fazıl next began to publish the magazine called ''[[Büyük Doğu (magazine)|Büyük Doğu]]'' (Great East). Starting in 1943, the magazine was published intermittently as weekly, daily and monthly. In 1978, he was prosecuted because of his controversial articles and publications and the magazine was forced to close. Necip Fazıl also published a political humor magazine called ''Borazan'' (Bugle), of which only three volumes were published.
