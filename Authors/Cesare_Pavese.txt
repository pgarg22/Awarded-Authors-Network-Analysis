'''Cesare Pavese''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|p|æ|ˈ|v|eɪ|z|eɪ|,_|-|z|i}} {{respell|pav|AY|zay|,_-|zee}},<ref>{{Cite Oxford&nbsp;Dictionaries|Pavese, Cesare|accessdate=9 August 2019}}</ref> {{IPA-it|ˈtʃeːzare paˈveːze, ˈtʃɛː-, -eːse|lang}}; 9 September 1908 – 27 August 1950) was an Italian [[novelist]], [[poet]], [[short story writer]], [[translator]], [[literary critic]], and [[essay]]ist.

== Early life and education ==
Cesare Pavese was born in [[Santo Stefano Belbo]], in the [[province of Cuneo]]. It was the village where his father was born and where the family returned for the summer holidays each year. He started infant classes in Santo Stefano Belbo, but the rest of his education was in schools in [[Turin]].

He attended [[Liceo Classico Massimo d'Azeglio]] in Turin for his sixth form/senior high school studies.<ref name=Wardp11>Ward, David. "Primo Levi's Turin." In: Gordon, Robert S.C. (editor). ''The Cambridge Companion to Primo Levi'' (Cambridge Companions to Literature). [[Cambridge University Press]], 30 July 2007. {{ISBN|1139827405}}, 9781139827409. CITED: p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Tvc62erY0PAC&pg=PA11 11].</ref> His most important teacher at the time was [[Augusto Monti]], writer and educator, whose writing style attempted to be devoid of all rhetoric.

As a young man of letters, Pavese had a particular interest in English-language literature, graduating from the [[University of Turin]] with a thesis on the poetry of [[Walt Whitman]]. Among his mentors at the university was [[Leone Ginzburg]], expert on Russian literature and literary critic, husband of the writer [[Natalia Ginzburg]] and father of the future historian [[Carlo Ginzburg]]. In those years, Pavese translated both classic and recent American and British authors that were then new to the Italian public.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cesare Pavese a San Francisco.

== Arrest and conviction; the war in Italy ==
Pavese moved in [[antifascist]] circles. In 1935 he was arrested and convicted for having letters from a political prisoner. After a few months in prison he was sent into ''"confino"'', internal exile in Southern Italy, the commonly used sentence for those guilty of lesser political crimes. ([[Carlo Levi]] and Leone Ginzburg, also from Turin, were similarly sent into ''confino''.) A year later Pavese returned to Turin, where he worked for the left-wing publisher [[Giulio Einaudi]] as editor and translator. Natalia Ginzburg also worked there.

Pavese was living in Rome when he was called up into the fascist army, but because of his [[asthma]] he spent six months in a military hospital. When he returned to Turin, German troops occupied the streets and most of his friends had left to fight as partisans. Pavese fled to the hills around Serralunga di Crea, near [[Casale Monferrato]]. He took no part in the armed struggle taking place in that area. During the years in Turin, he was the mentor of the young writer and translator [[Fernanda Pivano]], his former student at the Liceo D'Azeglio. Pavese gave her the American edition of ''[[Spoon River Anthology]]'', which came out in Pivano's Italian translation in 1943.

== After the war ==
After World War II Pavese joined the [[Italian Communist Party]] and worked on the party's newspaper, ''[[L'Unità]]''. The bulk of his work was published during this time. Toward the end of his life, he would frequently visit Le Langhe, the area where he was born, where he found great solace. Depression, the failure of a brief love affair with the actress [[Constance Dowling]], to whom his last novel and one of his last poems ("Death will come and she'll have your eyes"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.stephen-spender.org/2013_prize/2013_14_commend_LdV.html|title=''Death will come and she'll have your eyes'' – The Times Stephen Spender Prize 2013 (commended)|last=di Vincenzo|first=Ludovica|date=2014|publisher=Stephen Spender Trust|access-date=7 February 2014}}</ref>) were dedicated, and political disillusionment led him to his suicide by an overdose of [[barbiturates]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.italica.rai.it/eng/principal/topics/bio/pavese.htm |title=Cesare Pavese |publisher=Italica |access-date=20 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606044311/http://www.italica.rai.it/eng/principal/topics/bio/pavese.htm |archive-date=6 June 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref> in 1950.  That year he had won the [[Strega Prize]] for ''La Bella Estate'', comprising three novellas: 'La tenda', written in 1940, 'Il diavolo sulle colline' (1948) and 'Tra donne sole' (1949).

[[Leslie Fiedler]] wrote of Pavese's death "...for the Italians, his death has come to have a weight like that of [[Hart Crane]] for us, a meaning that penetrates back into his own work and functions as a symbol in the literature of an age."<ref>''Twentieth Century Authors: A Biographical Dictionary of Modern Literature: First Supplement'', edited by [[Stanley Kunitz|Stanley J. Kunitz]], New York: The H. W. Wilson Company, 1955.</ref> The circumstances of his suicide, which took place in a hotel room, mimic the last scene of ''Tra Donne Sole'' (''Among Women Only''), his penultimate book. His last book was 'La Luna e i Falò', published in Italy in 1950 and translated into English as ''[[The Moon and the Bonfires]]'' by [[Louise Sinclair]] in 1952.

He was an atheist.<ref>Paloni, Piermassimo, ''Il giornalismo di Cesare Pavese'', Landoni, 1977, p. 11.</ref>

== Themes in Pavese's works ==
The typical protagonist in the works of Pavese is a loner, through choice or through circumstances. His relationships with men and women tend to be temporary and superficial. He may wish to have more solidarity with other people, but he often ends up betraying his ideals and friends; for example in ''The Prison'', the political exile in a village in Southern Italy receives a note from another political ''confinato'' living nearby, who suggests a meeting. The protagonist rejects a show of solidarity and refuses to meet him. The title of the collection of the two novellas is ''Before the Cock Crows'', a reference to [[St. Peter|Peter]]'s betrayal of Christ before his death.

The [[Langhe]], the area where he spent his summer holidays as a boy, had a great hold on Pavese. It is a land of rolling hills covered in vineyards. It is an area where he felt literally at home, but he recognised the harsh and brutal lives that poor peasants had making a living from the land. Bitter struggles took place between Germans and partisans in this area. The land became part of Pavese's personal mythology.

In ''The Moon and the Bonfires'', the protagonist tells a story of drinking beer in a bar in America. A man comes in whom he recognizes as being from the valleys of Le Langhe by his way of walking and his outlook. He speaks to him in dialect suggesting a bottle of their local wine would be better than the beer.  After some years in America, the protagonist returns to his home village. He explores Le Langhe with a friend who had remained in the area. He finds out that so many of his contemporaries have died in sad circumstances, some as partisans shot by the Germans, while a notable local beauty had been executed by partisans as a fascist spy.
