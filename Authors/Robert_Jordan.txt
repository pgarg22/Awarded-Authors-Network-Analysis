===The Wheel of Time===
{{main|The Wheel of Time}}
Jordan published 11 books of a total 14 in the main sequence of the Wheel of Time series. Reviewers and fans of the earlier books noted a slowing of the pace of events in the last few installments written solely by Jordan owing to the expansion of scale of the series as a whole.<ref>Cannon, Peter. CROSSROADS OF TWILIGHT (Book). Publishers Weekly; December 23, 2002, Vol. 249 Issue 51, p.50</ref> Because of his health problems, Jordan did not work at full force on the final installment ''[[A Memory of Light]]'' (later split into three volumes beginning with ''[[The Gathering Storm (novel)|The Gathering Storm]]''), but blog entries confirmed that he continued work on it until his death, and he shared all of the significant plot details with his family not long before he died.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dragonmount.com/RobertJordan/?p=66 |title=Robert Jordan's Official Blog |publisher=Dragonmount.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-28}}</ref> He maintained that in doing so the book will get published even if "the worst actually happens".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2006/11/30/robert-jordan-illness-tech-media_cx_hc_books06_1201jordan.html |title=Forbes article on Jordan's illness |work=Forbes.com |date=2006-11-30 |accessdate=2011-11-28}}</ref> On December 7, 2007, Tor Books announced that [[Brandon Sanderson]] had been chosen to finish the Wheel of Time series. [[Harriet McDougal]], Jordan's widow, chose him after reading ''[[Mistborn: The Final Empire]]''.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071212090331/http://www.tor-forge.com/NewsArticle.aspx?articleId=647 TOR Press Release]</ref>

''[[The World of Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time]]'' is an encyclopedia for the series about the unnamed world where the plot takes place, which is often referred by fans of the series as [[the World of the Wheel]]. It is published in the United States by [[Tor Books]] and in the United Kingdom by [[Orbit Books]]. The bulk of the text was written by Teresa Patterson based on notes and information provided by Jordan, who also served as overall editor on the project. While the information in the guide is broadly canonical, the book is deliberately written with vague, biased or even downright false (or guessed) information in places, as Patterson felt this would reflect a key theme of the series (the mutability of knowledge across time and distance).<ref>[http://www.dragonmount.com/News/?p=213 Teresa Patterson at DragonCon 2005]</ref>

===Conan the Barbarian===
{{main|Conan the Barbarian}}
Jordan was one of several writers who has written [[Conan the Barbarian]] stories. When [[Tom Doherty]] obtained the rights, he needed a novel very quickly, so Jordan's wife Harriet McDougal recommended him because she knew he had written his first novel, ''Warriors of the Altaii'', in thirteen days.
<blockquote>So he thought I could write something fast, and he was right, and I liked it. It was fun writing something completely over the top, full of [[purple prose]], and in a weak moment I agreed to do five more and the novelization of the second Conan movie. I've decided that those things were very good discipline for me. I had to work with a character and a [[Hyboria|world]] that had already been created and yet find a way to say something new about the character and the world. That was a very good exercise.<ref name="theoryland2003">{{cite web | url=http://www.theoryland.com/intvmain.php?i=168#11 | title=SFRevu Interview with Robert Jordan | publisher=SFRevu | author=Ernest Lilley | date=2003-01-21 | accessdate=2012-04-13}}</ref></blockquote>
