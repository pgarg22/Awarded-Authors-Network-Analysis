'''Mary Hayley Bell, Lady Mills''' (22 January 1911 – 1 December 2005) was an English actress and writer, married for 64 years to actor Sir [[John Mills]]. Her novel ''[[Whistle Down the Wind (novel)|Whistle Down the Wind]]'' was [[Whistle Down the Wind (film)|adapted as a film]], starring her teenaged daughter, actress [[Hayley Mills]].

==Background==
Mary Hayley Bell was born in [[Shanghai International Settlement]], Shanghai, China, where her father, Colonel Francis Hayley Bell, served in the [[Chinese Maritime Customs Service]] with postings to various Treaty Ports. Her mother was Agnes (née McGowan). Her father, a [[Boer War]] veteran, served, from 1925 to 1928, as Customs Commissioner for Kowloon (within Hong Hong, although this position had no connection with the British colonial administration). During this period Mary attended school in Hong Kong and frequently spent weekends of leisure at the Commissioner's official country bungalow near Fan Ling Golf Club.<ref>From staff records: "The Maritimes Customs – officers in Charge 1921 -1935)" and from verbal information provided by Mary Bell herself to Hong Kong Police Inspector P. A. Crush in 1968- not a good enough source; needs support from reliable published source.</ref> The family later (1930) moved to [[Tianjin]] (then known as Tientsin). In the run-up to World War II, Francis Bell was the Defence Security Officer in Singapore in 1936 [[MI5]]. He staged a mock commando raid on Singapore's vital installations, including the naval base, where his men took control of a fuel dump, fleet of boats, and telephone exchange switchboards, in order to highlight Singapore's vulnerability to attack. This led to furious reactions from senior officials, with complaints being made to the War Office, and Bell was sacked.<ref>The Battle for Singapore: The True Story of the Greatest Catastrophe of World War II, Peter Thompson, Little, Brown, 2010</ref>

==Marriage and children==
It was while living at Tianjin, China, that she first met John Mills, who was on tour at the time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/mary-hayley-bell-518168.html|title=Mary Hayley Bell|date=2 April 2009|website=The Independent}}</ref> They next met when she was appearing in ''Tony Draws a Horse'' at the Comedy Theatre in London in 1939. She recalled an after-dinner party in Mills's dressing room after one of his performances as George in ''[[Of Mice and Men (play)|Of Mice and Men]]'' at the [[Apollo Theatre]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

Mills and Hayley Bell married at [[Marylebone]] Registry Office in London on 16 January 1941. Mills had a 48-hour pass from the [[Royal Engineers]], so their honeymoon at [[Duke's Hotel]] <!--often said to be on Jermyn Street, but actually in St James' Place--> was one night. The Mills's first home was a 16th-century cottage named "Misbourne" which they purchased in 1942 and lived at until the autumn of 1945. The survival of the marriage for the 64 years until his death on 23 April 2005 is rare in show business. Mills said that he regretted that his divorce from his first wife prevented Hayley Bell from having a church wedding. They renewed their marriage vows, sixty years after they married, at St. Mary's Church in [[Denham, Buckinghamshire]] on 16 January 2001.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

The Millses had three children: 
* [[Juliet Mills]] (b. 1941) was star of television's ''[[Nanny and the Professor]]''.
* [[Hayley Mills]] (b. 1946) was the Disney child star made iconic by starring in ''[[Pollyanna (1960 film)|Pollyanna]]'', ''[[The Chalk Garden]]'', and the original ''[[The Parent Trap (1961 film)|The Parent Trap]]''. Her son [[Crispian Mills]] became a successful singer with the rock band [[Kula Shaker]].
* Jonathan Mills (b. 1949) is a writer and film producer.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0590066/ |publisher=IMDb |title=Jonathan Mills}}</ref>

==Death==
In 1975, the Mills family bought [[Hills House, Denham|Hills House]], [[Denham, Buckinghamshire]], a 17th-century house with a four-acre (16&nbsp;000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>) garden. By 2003, it was too big and the stairs were too challenging for both Sir John and Lady Mills. They moved to a [[bungalow]] in the village in 2003. Lady Mills suffered from [[Alzheimer's disease]] and used a wheelchair in her final years. Sir John died on 23 April 2005, aged 97, in Buckinghamshire.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.findmypast.com/BirthsMarriagesDeaths.jsp |title=Deaths England and Wales 1984–2006 |work=findmypast.com}}</ref> His widow died eight months later, on 1 December 2005, aged 94.
