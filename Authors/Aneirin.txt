'''Aneirin''' {{IPA-cy|aˈnɛirɪn|}} or '''Neirin''' was an [[Wales in the Early Middle Ages|early Medieval]] [[Celtic Britons|Brythonic]] [[war poet]]. He is believed to have been a [[bard]] or court poet in one of the [[Cumbric]] kingdoms of the [[Hen Ogledd]], probably that of [[Gododdin]] at [[Edinburgh]], in modern [[Scotland]]. From the 17th century, he was usually known as Aneurin.<ref>Miller, Arthur (1885). "[[wikisource:Dictionary_of_National_Biography,_1885-1900/Aneurin|Aneurin]]".

==Life==
Some records indicate that Aneirin was the son of Caunus (or Caw) and brother to [[Gildas]].<ref name="The Four Ancient Books of Wales">{{Cite journal |last=Skene |first=William F |title=The Four Ancient Books of Wales, Containing the Cymric Poems attributed to the Bards of the Sixth Century |journal=The Dublin University Magazine |date=August 1868 |volume=LXXII |issue=CCCCXXVIII |pages=226–240 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YOARAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1}}</ref> According to this version of his life, he was born at [[Dumbarton]] on the [[River Clyde]]. However, some scholars debate this parentage, and contend that these records are of later invention and are erroneous. Whoever his father was, Aneirin's mother, Dwywei is mentioned in ''[[Y Gododdin]]''. She may be the same lady who, according to Old Welsh pedigrees, married King Dunod who is generally thought to have ruled in [[West Riding of Yorkshire|West Yorkshire]]. He may also be kin to another Brythonic poet, Cian Gwenith Gwawd.

Aneirin's patrons were the noble [[Urien]] and his son, [[Owain mab Urien|Owain]].<ref name="The Four Ancient Books of Wales" /> Owain was slain at the [[Battle of Catraeth]], in which Brythonic warriors of Gododdin went up against the [[Angles]] of [[Deira]] and [[Bernicia]]. Nearly all of the Brythonic warriors were slain and their lands were absorbed into the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. Aneirin wrote ''Y Gododdin'' after this battle, in remembrance of his fallen patrons and lords, in which he hints that he is likely the sole survivor.<ref>[http://www.llgc.org.uk/index.php?id=6493 "The Book of Aneirin", Llyfrgell Genedlaethol Cymru]</ref>

After the fall of Owain, he is said to have been murdered at the hands of an unnamed Cymric lord, whom the poet had offended by reproaching him in his poem ''Y Gododdin'' for not coming to the aid of Owain.<ref name="The Four Ancient Books of Wales" />

==Reputation==
The ''[[Welsh Triads]]'' describe Aneirin as "prince of bards" and "of flowing verse". [[Nennius]] praises him amongst the earliest [[Welsh poetry|Welsh poets]] or ''Cynfeirdd'', a contemporary of [[Talhaearn Tad Awen|Talhaearn]], [[Taliesin]], Bluchbardd and Cian. References to Aneirin are found in the work of the ''Poets of the Princes'' (''Beirdd y Tywysogion''), but his fame declined in the later Middle Ages until the re-assertion of [[Culture of Wales|Welsh identity]] by antiquarian writers of the [[Tudor period]]. Today, the reputation of his poetry remains high, though the exact identity of the author is more controversial.

==Poetry==
The works attributed to Aneirin are preserved in a late-13th-century [[manuscript]] known as the ''[[Book of Aneirin]]'' (or ''Llyfr Aneirin''). The language has been partially modernized into [[Middle Welsh]], but other portions in [[Old Welsh]] indicate that at least some of the poetry dates from around Aneirin's time, and its attribution, therefore, may well be genuine. The work would have survived through oral transmission until first written down, perhaps in the 9th century.

Aneirin's best known work is ''[[Y Gododdin]]'', a series of elegies for the warriors of the northern [[Celtic Britons|Brittonic]] kingdom of Gododdin who, in about 600, fell against the [[Angles]] of [[Deira]] and [[Bernicia]] at the [[Battle of Catraeth]] (probably [[Catterick, North Yorkshire]]). The poetry abounds in textual difficulties and consequently interpretations vary. One stanza contains what may possibly be the earliest reference to [[King Arthur]], as a paragon of bravery with whom one fallen warrior is compared – the identification is, however, conjectural. The poem tells us that Aneirin was present at this battle and, having been taken prisoner, was one of only two or four Brittonic survivors; he remained a captive until his ransom was paid by Ceneu ap [[Llywarch Hen]].
