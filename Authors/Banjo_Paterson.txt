He wrote many ballads and poems about Australian life, focusing particularly on the rural and [[outback]] areas, including the district around [[Binalong, New South Wales|Binalong]], [[New South Wales]], where he spent much of his childhood. Paterson's more notable poems include "[[Clancy of the Overflow]]" (1889), "[[The Man from Snowy River (poem)|The Man from Snowy River]]" (1890) and "[[Waltzing Matilda]]" (1895), regarded widely as Australia's unofficial national anthem.

==Early life==
Andrew Barton Paterson was born at the property "Narrambla", near [[Orange, New South Wales]], the eldest son of Andrew Bogle Paterson, a Scottish immigrant from [[Lanarkshire]], and Australian-born Rose Isabella Barton,<ref name="ADB"/> related to the future first [[Prime Minister of Australia]] [[Edmund Barton]].<ref name=DAB>{{cite web |url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks15/1500721h/0-dict-biogP-Q.html#paterson1 |title=Paterson, Andrew Barton (1864–1941) |access-date=19 January 2008 |author=Percival Serle |work=[[Dictionary of Australian Biography]] |publisher=Angus & Robertson |year=1949 |author-link=Percival Serle |archive-date=27 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190527165454/http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks15/1500721h/0-dict-biogP-Q.html#paterson1 |url-status=live }}</ref> Paterson's family lived on the isolated [[Buckinbah|Buckinbah Station]] near [[Yeoval]] NSW<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.yeoval.com.au/about-yeoval/yeoval-visitor-info/history-of-banjo-paterson.html |title=Yeoval Community Website |access-date=16 February 2014 |archive-date=15 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140215012325/http://www.yeoval.com.au/about-yeoval/yeoval-visitor-info/history-of-banjo-paterson.html |url-status=live }}</ref> until he was five when his father lost his wool clip in a flood and was forced to sell up.<ref name="DM56"/> When Paterson's uncle [[John Paterson (Australian politician)|John Paterson]] died, his family took over John Paterson's farm in Illalong, near [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]], close to the main route between [[Melbourne]] and Sydney.  [[Bullock cart|Bullock teams]], [[Cobb and Co]] coaches and drovers were familiar sights to him. He also saw horsemen from the [[Murrumbidgee River]] area and [[Snowy Mountains]] country take part in [[Picnic horse racing|picnic races]] and [[polo]] matches, which led to his fondness of horses and inspired his writings.<ref name="ADB"/>

Paterson's early education came from a [[governess]], but when he was able to ride a pony, he was taught at the bush school at [[Binalong, New South Wales|Binalong]]. In 1874 Paterson was sent to [[Sydney Grammar School]], performing well both as a student and a sportsman. During this time, he lived in a cottage called Rockend, in the suburb of [[Gladesville, New South Wales|Gladesville]]. The cottage is now listed on the [[Register of the National Estate]] and [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?ID=2340020 |title=New South Wales State Heritage Register: ''Rockend Cottage'' later ''Banjo Paterson Cottage Restaurant'' |access-date=26 May 2020 |archive-date=22 December 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201222031439/https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?ID=2340020 |url-status=live }}</ref> He left the prestigious school at 16 after failing an examination for a scholarship to the [[University of Sydney]].<ref name=adb>{{cite web|last1=Semmler|first1=Clement|title=Andrew Barton (Banjo) Paterson|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/paterson-andrew-barton-banjo-7972|website=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=Australian Dictionary of Biography|access-date=20 October 2014|archive-date=9 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140309024459/http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/paterson-andrew-barton-banjo-7972|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Career==
Paterson was a law clerk with a Sydney-based firm headed by Herbert Salwey, and was admitted as a solicitor in 1886.<ref name=adb /> In the years he practised as a solicitor, he also started writing. From 1885, he began submitting and having poetry published in ''[[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin]]'', a literary journal with a nationalist focus. His earliest work was a poem criticising the British war in the Sudan, which also had Australian participation. Over the next decade, the influential journal provided an important platform for Paterson's work, which appeared under the pseudonym of "The Banjo", the name of his favourite horse.<ref>{{cite web|title=A.B.

Brady]], [[Breaker Morant|Harry "Breaker" Morant]], [[William Henry Ogilvie|Will H. Ogilvie]], and [[Henry Lawson]]. In particular, Paterson became engaged in a [[Bulletin Debate|friendly rivalry]] of verse with Lawson about the allure of bush life.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Semmler|first1=Clement|title=Andrew Barton (Banjo) Paterson|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/paterson-andrew-barton-banjo-7972|website=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=Australian Dictionary of Biography|access-date=28 October 2014|archive-date=9 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140309024459/http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/paterson-andrew-barton-banjo-7972|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Journalism===
[[File:Andrew Barton (Banjo) Paterson.jpg|thumb|upright|Studio portrait by Falk Studios]]
Paterson became a [[war correspondent]] for ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and ''[[The Age]]'' during the [[Second Boer War]], sailing for South Africa in October 1899. His graphic accounts of the [[Siege of Kimberley|relief of Kimberley]], surrender of [[Bloemfontein]] (the first correspondent to ride in) and the capture of [[Pretoria]] attracted the attention of the press in Britain.<ref name="ADB"/> An untouched box of chocolates, created by the British company [[Cadbury|Cadburys]] for [[Queen Victoria]] as a 1900 New Year's gift for troops serving in South Africa, was discovered in Paterson's papers at the [[National Library of Australia]] in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|title=National Library finds 120-year-old chocolates commissioned by Queen Victoria and owned by Banjo Paterson - ABC News|url=https://amp.abc.net.au/article/13001562|access-date=2020-12-20|website=amp.abc.net.au|archive-date=21 December 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201221064703/https://amp.abc.net.au/article/13001562|url-status=live}}</ref> He also was a correspondent during the [[Boxer Rebellion]], where he met [[George Ernest Morrison|George "Chinese" Morrison]] and later wrote about his meeting.<ref name="ADB"/> He was editor of the ''Sydney Evening News'' (1904–06) and of the ''Town and Country Journal'' (1907–08).<ref>''Australian Writers'', L. J. Blake, Rigby Limited, 1968</ref>

===Hiatus and military service===
In 1908 after a trip to the United Kingdom he decided to abandon journalism and writing and moved with his family to a {{convert|40000|acre|ha|adj=on|order=flip}} property near [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]].<ref name='DM56'>{{cite news | title=Bard of the Bush | date=20 June 1956 | publisher=Truth and Sportsman Ltd | work =Daily Mirror| page =21 }}</ref>

In [[World War I]], Paterson failed to become a correspondent covering the fighting in Flanders, but did become an ambulance driver with the [[Australian Voluntary Hospital]], [[Wimereux]], France. He returned to Australia early in 1915 and, as an honorary vet, travelled on three voyages with horses to Africa, China and Egypt. He was commissioned in the 2nd Remount Unit, [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] on 18 October 1915,<ref name="ADB"/> serving initially in France where he was wounded and reported missing in July 1916 and latterly as commanding officer of the unit based in [[Cairo]], Egypt.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article234609374 |title='BANJO' WON |newspaper=[[Smith's Weekly]] |volume=XXIII |issue=2 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=8 March 1941 |access-date=17 December 2017 |page=16 |via=National Library of Australia |archive-date=22 December 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201222031437/https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/234609374 |url-status=live }}</ref> He was repatriated to Australia and discharged from the army having risen to the rank of major in April 1919.<ref name='NAA'>{{cite web |title=Paterson, Andrew Barton Service Records Item no 4028776 |access-date=17 May 2019 |publisher=National Archives of Australia |url=https://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/Interface/ViewImage.aspx?B=4028776 |archive-date=4 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190404180629/https://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/Interface/ViewImage.aspx?B=4028776 |url-status=live }}</ref> His wife had joined the Red Cross and worked in an ambulance unit near her husband.<ref name="DM56"/>

Just as he returned to Australia, the third collection of his poetry, ''Saltbush Bill JP'', was published and he continued to publish verse, short stories and essays while continuing to write for the weekly ''[[Truth (Sydney newspaper)|Truth]]''.<ref name="DM56"/> Paterson also wrote on [[rugby league]] football in the 1920s for the ''[[Sydney Sportsman]]''.<ref>{{cite web

==Personal life==

On 8 April 1903 he married Alice Emily Walker, of Tenterfield Station, in St Stephen's Presbyterian Church, in [[Tenterfield]], [[New South Wales]].<ref>''Banjo Paterson-His Life'', Tenterfield Tourism</ref><ref>[http://www.bushverse.com/paterson/paterverse.htm ''The Verse of A.B.

The Patersons had two children, Grace (born in 1904) and Hugh (born in 1906).

Paterson had been previously engaged to Sarah Riley for eight years, but this was abruptly called off in 1895 following a visit to her at Dagworth Station in Queensland where she was visiting the Macpherson family. It was here that Paterson met his fiancée's best friend from school days, Christina Macpherson, who composed the music for which he then wrote the lyrics of the famous [[Waltzing Matilda]]. However, following this collaboration Paterson was suddenly asked to leave the property, leading historians to conclude that he was a womanizer and had engaged in a scandalous romantic liaison with Macpherson.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Banjo and Matilda : the story of Waltzing Matilda|last=1941-|first=Forrest, Peter|date=2007|publisher=Shady Tree|others=Forrest, Sheila, 1953-|isbn=9780980351507|location=Darwin, N.T.|oclc=225318439}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Waltzing Matilda : the secret history of Australia's favourite song|last=Dennis.|first=O'Keeffe|date=2012|publisher=Allen & Unwin|isbn=9781742377063|location=Crows Nest, N.S.W.|oclc=780413544}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/mistress-the-true-story-of-mistresses-and-their-men-chapter-8-the-love-triangle-behind-waltzing-matilda/news-story/a8804da5d3df91db3c2cde9f16b5eb13|title=Mistress: The true story of mistresses and their men.

==Works==
[[File:The Old Bush Songs by Banio Paterson.jpg|thumb|upright|Cover to Paterson's seminal 1905 collection of bush ballads, entitled ''[[Bush ballad|Old Bush Songs]]'']]
The publication of The Man from Snowy River and five other ballads in ''The Bulletin'' made "The Banjo" a household name.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Semmler|first1=Clement|title=Banjo Paterson: Collected Verse|date=2007|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=9780140146219|pages=4}}</ref> In 1895, Angus & Robertson published these poems as a collection of Australian verse.

In 1895, Paterson headed north to Dagworth station near [[Winton, Queensland]]. Travelling with fiancée, Sarah Riley, they met with her old school friend, [[Christina Macpherson]], who had recently attended a race at [[Warrnambool]] in Victoria. She had heard a band playing a tune there, which became stuck in her head and replayed it for Paterson on the [[autoharp]]. The melody also resonated with him and propelled him to write 
"[[Waltzing Matilda]]"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Parker|first1=Derek|title=The man who wrote Waltzing Maltilda|date=2009|publisher=Woodslane Press|isbn=9781921606076|pages=35–36}}</ref> While there has been much debate about what inspired the words, the song became one of his most widely known and sung ballads.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Semmler|first1=Clement|title=Banjo Paterson: Collected Verse|date=2007|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9780140146219|pages=5}}</ref>

In addition, he wrote the lyrics for songs with piano scores, such as "The Daylight is Dying"<ref>{{cite web|title=The daylight is dying [music]|url=http://library.sl.nsw.gov.au/record=b2519096~S2|website=State Library of New South Wales Catalogue|publisher=State Library of New South Wales|access-date=8 December 2014|archive-date=11 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211122502/http://library.sl.nsw.gov.au/record=b2519096~S2|url-status=live}}</ref> and ''Last Week''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Last week [music]: song|url=http://library.sl.nsw.gov.au/record=b2531601~S2|website=State Library of New South Wales|publisher=State Library of New South Wales|access-date=8 December 2014|archive-date=11 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211122433/http://library.sl.nsw.gov.au/record=b2531601~S2|url-status=live}}</ref> These were also published by Angus & Robertson between the years 1895 to 1899. In 1905, the same publishers released ''Old Bush Songs'', a collection of [[bush ballads]] Paterson had been assembling since 1895.<ref>{{cite web|title=A.B.

Although for most of his adult life, Paterson lived and worked in Sydney, his poems mostly presented a highly romantic view of the bush and the iconic figure of the bushman. Influenced by the work of another Australian poet, [[John Farrell (Australian poet)|John Farrell]], his representation of the bushman as a tough, independent and heroic underdog became the ideal qualities underpinning the national character.<ref>{{cite web|title=A.B. 'Banjo' Paterson|url=http://www.poetrylibrary.edu.au/poets/paterson-a-b-banjo|website=Australian Poetry Library|publisher=Australian Poetry Library|access-date=21 November 2014|archive-date=25 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025060746/http://www.poetrylibrary.edu.au/poets/paterson-a-b-banjo/|url-status=live}}</ref> His work is often compared to the prose of Henry Lawson, particularly the seminal work, "The Drover's Wife", which presented a considerably less romantic view of the harshness of rural existence of the late 19th century.

Paterson authored two novels; ''An Outback Marriage'' (1906) and ''The Shearer's Colt'' (1936), wrote many short stories; ''Three Elephant Power and Other Stories'' (1917), and wrote a book based on his experiences as a war reporter, ''Happy Dispatches'' (1934).  He also wrote a book for children, ''The Animals Noah Forgot'' (1933)

Contemporary recordings of many of Paterson's well known poems have been released by [[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]],<ref name="Jack Thompson's recordings of poems by Banjo Paterson">{{Cite web |url=http://www.finepoets.com/ |title=finepoets.com |access-date=10 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180318222844/http://finepoets.com/ |archive-date=18 March 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> who played Clancy in the 1982 [[The Man from Snowy River (1982 film)|film adaptation]] of "The Man from Snowy River".
