[[File:Cannon Hall, A.R. Quinton, 1911.JPG|thumbnail|[[Cannon Hall, Hampstead]], drawn by [[A.R. Quinton]], 1911, where du Maurier spent much of her childhood.]]

'''Dame Daphne du Maurier, Lady Browning''', {{post-nominals|DBE}} ({{IPAc-en|d|uː|_|ˈ|m|ɒr|i|eɪ}}; 13 May 1907 – 19 April 1989) was an English [[author]] and [[playwright]].

Although she is classed as a romantic novelist, her stories have been described as "moody and resonant" with overtones of the [[paranormal]]. Her bestselling works were not at first taken seriously by critics, but have since earned an enduring reputation for narrative craft. Many have been successfully adapted into films, including the novels ''[[Rebecca (novel)|Rebecca]]'', ''[[Frenchman's Creek (novel)|Frenchman's Creek]]'', ''[[My Cousin Rachel]]'', and ''[[Jamaica Inn (novel)|Jamaica Inn]]'', and the short stories [[The Birds (story)|''The Birds'']] and [[Not After Midnight|''Don't Look Now/Not After Midnight'']].

Du Maurier spent much of her life in [[Cornwall]], where most of her works are set. As her fame increased, she became more reclusive.<ref>Dunn, Jane. Daphne du Maurier and Her Sisters. HarperPress (2013)</ref>

Her parents were actor/manager [[Gerald du Maurier|Sir Gerald du Maurier]] and stage actress [[Muriel Beaumont]]. Her grandfather was writer and [[cartoonist]] [[George du Maurier]].

==Early life==
Daphne du Maurier was born at 24 [[Cumberland Terrace]], [[Regent's Park]], London, the middle of three daughters of prominent actor-manager [[Gerald du Maurier|Sir Gerald du Maurier]] and actress [[Muriel Beaumont]].<ref name="ODNB">{{Cite ODNB|id=39829|title=Du Maurier [married name Browning], Dame Daphne (1907–1989)}}</ref> Her mother was a maternal niece of journalist, author, and lecturer [[William Comyns Beaumont]].<ref>[http://www.enotes.com/short-story-criticism/du-maurier-daphne/richard-kelly-essay-date-1987 Daphne du Maurier profile by Richard Kelly (essay date 1987)], "The World of the Macabre: The Short Stories", ''Daphne du Maurier'', [[Twayne Publishers]], 1987, pp. 123–40.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref> Her grandfather was author and ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' [[cartoonist]] [[George du Maurier]], who created the character of [[Svengali]] in the 1894 novel ''[[Trilby (novel)|Trilby]]''. Her elder sister, [[Angela du Maurier]], also became a writer, and her younger sister [[Jeanne du Maurier|Jeanne]] was a painter.<ref name="Dunn, Jane 2013">Dunn, Jane ''Daphne du Maurier and her Sisters''HarperPress (2013)</ref>

Du Maurier's family connections helped her establish her literary career, and she published some of her early work in Beaumont's ''[[Bystander (magazine)|Bystander]]'' magazine. Her first novel, ''[[The Loving Spirit]],'' was published in 1931. Du Maurier was also a cousin of the [[Llewelyn Davies boys]], who served as [[J. M. Barrie]]'s inspiration for the characters in the play ''[[Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up]]''.<ref name="Dunn, Jane 2013"/>

As a young child, du Maurier met many prominent theatre actors, thanks to the celebrity of her father. On meeting [[Tallulah Bankhead]], du Maurier was quoted as saying that Bankhead was the most beautiful creature she had ever seen.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Tallulah Bankhead: a scandalous life|last=Bret|first=David|date=1 January 1998|publisher=Robson Books; Parkwest Publications|isbn=1861051905|location=London/Jersey City, NJ|page=34|language=en|oclc = 40157558}}</ref>

==Novels, short stories, and biographies==
The novel ''[[Rebecca (novel)|Rebecca]]'' (1938) was one of du Maurier's most successful works. It was an immediate hit, selling nearly 3 million copies between 1938 and 1965. The novel has never gone out of print. In the United States, du Maurier won the [[List of National Book Award winners#1935 to 1941|National Book Award]] for favourite novel of 1938 for the book, voted by members of the [[American Booksellers Association]].<ref>"Book About Plants Receives Award: Dr. Fairchild's 'Garden' Work Cited by Booksellers", ''The New York Times'', 15 February 1939, p. 20. ProQuest Historical Newspapers The New York Times (1851-2007).</ref> In the UK, it was listed at number 14 of the "nation's best-loved novel"s on the [[BBC]]'s 2003 survey [[The Big Read]].<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/bigread/top100.shtml "The Big Read"], BBC (April 2003). Retrieved 18 October 2012.</ref>

Other significant works include ''[[Jamaica Inn (novel)|Jamaica Inn]]'', ''[[Frenchman's Creek (novel)|Frenchman's Creek]]'', ''[[Hungry Hill (novel)|Hungry Hill]]'', ''[[My Cousin Rachel]]'', ''[[The Scapegoat (Du Maurier novel)|The Scapegoat]]'', ''[[The House on the Strand]]'', and ''[[The King's General]]''. The last is set in Cornwall during the [[English Civil War]], and is written from the [[cavalier|Royalist]] perspective. Unusually for du Maurier it has a female narrator.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fivebooks.com/best-books/daphne-du-maurier/|title=The Best Daphne Du Maurier Books {{!}} Five Books Expert Recommendations|last=Books|first=Five|website=Five Books|language=en|access-date=2019-01-21}}</ref>

[[File:MenabillyB&WPhoto.jpg|thumb|left|[[Menabilly]] house in [[Fowey]], which du Maurier leased in 1943. She restored it from a neglected state, and made it her home until 1969.]]
Du Maurier was often categorised as a "romantic novelist", a term that she deplored,<ref>BBC Interview, 1979.</ref> given her novels rarely have a happy ending, and often have sinister overtones and shadows of the paranormal. In this light, she has more in common with the "[[sensation novel]]s" of [[Wilkie Collins]] and others, which she admired.<ref name=Malet/> The obituarist [[Kate Kellaway]] wrote: "Du Maurier was mistress of calculated irresolution. She did not want to put her readers' minds at rest. She wanted her riddles to persist. She wanted the novels to continue to haunt us beyond their endings."<ref>Kate Kellaway, ''The Observer'', 15 April 2007. [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/apr/15/fiction.features1 "Daphne's unruly passions"], theguardian.com; retrieved 12 May 2016.</ref>

Du Maurier's novel ''[[Mary Anne (novel)|Mary Anne]]'' (1954) is a fictionalised account of her great-great-grandmother, [[Mary Anne Clarke]] née Thompson (1776–1852), who, from 1803 to 1808, was mistress of [[Frederick Augustus, Duke of York and Albany]] (1763–1827). He was the "[[The Grand Old Duke of York|Grand Old Duke of York]]" of the nursery rhyme, a son of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]], and brother of King [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] and King [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]]. The central character of her last novel, ''[[Rule Britannia (novel)|Rule Britannia]]'', is an aging actress, thought to be based on [[Gladys Cooper]] (to whom it is dedicated).{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

Du Maurier's short stories are darker: ''[[The Birds (story)|The Birds]]'', ''[[Not After Midnight#Don't Look Now|Don't Look Now]]'', ''The Apple Tree'', and ''The Blue Lenses'' are finely crafted tales of terror that shocked and surprised her audience in equal measure.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}} As her [[biographer]] [[Margaret Forster]] wrote, "She satisfied all the questionable criteria of popular fiction, and yet satisfied too the exacting requirements of 'real literature'."{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

The discovery, in 2011, of a collection of du Maurier's forgotten short stories, written when the author was 21, provides some insight into her mature style. One of them, ''The Doll'', concerns a young woman's obsession with a mechanical male sex doll; it has been deemed by du Maurier's son Kit Browning to be "quite ahead of its time".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/fan-tracks-down-lost-stories-of-daphne-du-maurier-2220130.html|location=London, UK|work=The Independent|first=Matthew|last=Bell|title=Fan tracks down lost stories of Daphne Du Maurier|date=20 February 2011}}</ref>

In later life, she wrote non-fiction, including several biographies such as ''Gerald'', her father's biography. ''The Glass-Blowers'' traces her French [[Huguenot]] ancestry and vividly depicts the [[French Revolution]]. ''The du Mauriers'' traces the family's move from France to England in the 19th century.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

''[[The House on the Strand]]'' (1969) combines elements of "mental time-travel", a tragic love affair in 14th-century Cornwall, and the dangers of using mind-altering drugs. Her final novel, ''[[Rule Britannia (novel)|Rule Britannia]]'' (1972), [[Satire|satirises]] resentment of British people in general, and Cornish people in particular, at increasing American involvement in UK affairs.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

===Film adaptations===
''Rebecca'' has been adapted for both stage and screen several times, most notably by [[Alfred Hitchcock]] in his 1940 film ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]''. Several of du Maurier's other novels have also been adapted for the screen, including ''Jamaica Inn'', ''Frenchman's Creek'', ''Hungry Hill'', and ''My Cousin Rachel''. The Hitchcock film ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963) is based on a treatment of the short story of that name, as is the film ''[[Don't Look Now]]'' (1973). Of the films, du Maurier often complained that the only ones she liked were Hitchcock's ''Rebecca'' and [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s ''Don't Look Now''.{{cn|date=October 2021}}

Hitchcock's treatment of ''[[Jamaica Inn (film)|Jamaica Inn]]'' was disavowed by both director and author, due to a complete re-write of the ending to accommodate the ego of its star, [[Charles Laughton]]. Du Maurier also felt that [[Olivia de Havilland]] was wrongly cast as the anti-heroine of ''[[My Cousin Rachel (1952 film)|My Cousin Rachel]]''.<ref>Martyn Shallcross, ''Daphne du Maurier Country'', Bossiney Books.</ref> ''[[Frenchman's Creek (novel)|Frenchman's Creek]]'' fared better in a lavish Technicolor version [[Frenchman's Creek (film)|released in 1944]]. Du Maurier later regretted her choice of [[Alec Guinness]] as the lead in the [[The Scapegoat (1959 film)|film]] of ''The Scapegoat'', which she partly financed.<ref name=Malet/>

==Playwright==
Du Maurier wrote three plays. Her first was an adaptation of her novel ''Rebecca'', which opened at the [[Sondheim Theatre|Queen's Theatre]] in London on 5 March 1940 in a production by [[George Devine]], starring [[Celia Johnson]] and [[Owen Nares]] as the De Winters and [[Margaret Rutherford]] as Mrs. Danvers. After 181 performances, the production transferred to the [[Novello Theatre|Strand Theatre]], with [[Jill Furse]] taking over as the second Mrs. De Winter and [[Mary Merrall]] as Mrs. Danvers, with a further run of 176 performances.

In 1943 she wrote the autobiographically inspired drama ''[[The Years Between (Daphne du Maurier play)|The Years Between]]'' about the unexpected return of a senior officer, thought killed in action, who finds that his wife has taken his seat as [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) and has started a romantic relationship with a local farmer. It was first staged at the [[Manchester Opera House]] in 1944 and then transferred to London, opening at [[Wyndham's Theatre]] on 10 January 1945, starring [[Nora Swinburne]] and [[Clive Brook]]. The production, directed by Irene Hentschel, became a long-running hit, completing 617 performances. It was revived by Caroline Smith at the [[Orange Tree Theatre]] in [[Richmond upon Thames]] on 5 September 2007, starring Karen Ascoe and [[Mark Tandy (actor)|Mark Tandy]].<ref>John Thaxter, [http://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/review.php/18169/the-years-between "The Years Between"], ''The Stage'', 10 September 2007.</ref>

Her third play, ''September Tide'', portrays a middle-aged woman whose [[bohemianism|bohemian]] artist son-in-law falls in love with her. Again directed by Irene Hentschel, it opened at the [[Aldwych Theatre]] on 15 December 1948 with [[Gertrude Lawrence]] as Stella. It closed in August 1949 after 267 performances.

==Personal names, titles and honours==
She was known as Daphne du Maurier from 1907 to 1932, when she married [[Frederick Browning]]. Still writing as Daphne du Maurier (1932–1946), she was otherwise titled Daphne du Maurier, Lady Browning (1946–1969). When she was elevated to the [[Order of the British Empire|Dame Commander of the British Empire]] in 1969, she was titled Dame Daphne du Maurier, Lady Browning DBE (1969–1989), but she never used the title.

According to her biographer [[Margaret Forster]], she told no one about the honour, so that even her children learned of it only from the newspapers. "She thought of pleading illness for the investiture, until her children insisted it would be a great day for the older grandchildren. So she went through with it, though she slipped out quietly afterwards to avoid the attention of the press."<ref>[[Margaret Forster]], ''Daphne du Maurier'', Chatto & Windus, 1993, p. 370, {{ISBN|0-7011-3699-5}}</ref>

==Accusations of plagiarism==
Shortly after ''Rebecca'' was published in [[Brazil]], critic {{interlanguage link|Álvaro Lins|pt|vertical-align=sup}} and other readers pointed out many resemblances to the 1934 book, [[A Sucessora|''A Sucessora'' (''The Successor'')]], by Brazilian writer [[Carolina Nabuco]]. According to Nabuco and her editor, not only the main plot, but also situations and entire dialogues had been copied.<ref>{{Citation|last=Nabuco|first= Carolina|year=1985|title=A Sucessora |edition= 6|publisher=Art|url= http://www.estantevirtual.com.br/sebonilsonlivros/Carolina-Nabuco-A-Sucessora-6a-Edicao-21797185|url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111002153216/http://www.estantevirtual.com.br/sebonilsonlivros/Carolina-Nabuco-A-Sucessora-6a-Edicao-21797185 |archive-date=2 October 2011}}</ref> Du Maurier denied having copied Nabuco's book, as did her publisher, pointing out that the plot elements used in ''Rebecca'' said to have been plagiarised were quite common.<ref>{{cite news |title= Bull's-Eye for Bovarys|work=Time|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,849789-2,00.html|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090209060731/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,849789-2,00.html|url-status= dead|archive-date= 9 February 2009|access-date=26 October 2007|date=2 February 1942}}</ref>

The controversy was examined in a 6 November 2002 article in ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref name=NYTimes>{{cite news|title=Tiger in a Lifeboat, Panther in a Lifeboat: A Furor Over a Novel|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/06/books/tiger-in-a-lifeboat-panther-in-a-lifeboat-a-furor-over-a-novel-755974.html|work=The New York Times|first=Larry|last=Rohter|date=6 November 2002}}</ref> The article said that according to Nabuco's memoirs, when the Hitchcock film ''Rebecca'' was first shown in Brazil, [[United Artists]] wanted Nabuco to sign a document stating that the similarities were merely a coincidence but she refused.<ref>{{cite web|language=pt|title=''Rebecca'' seria brasileira|trans-title=''Rebecca'' would be Brazilian|work=Os Filmes|url=http://osfilmes.com.br/cronicamente/materias/estadopr_files/cultura.htm|access-date=26 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915143210/http://osfilmes.com.br/cronicamente/materias/estadopr_files/cultura.htm|archive-date=15 September 2007}}</ref> The ''Times'' quoted Nabuco's memoirs as saying, "When the film version of 'Rebecca' came to Brazil, the producers' lawyer sought out my lawyer to ask him that I sign a document admitting the possibility of there having been a mere coincidence. I would be compensated with a quantity described as 'of considerable value.' I did not consent, naturally."<ref name="NYTimes" /> The ''Times'' article said, "Ms. Nabuco had translated her novel into French and sent it to a publisher in Paris, who she learned was also Ms. du Maurier's [publisher] only after ''Rebecca'' became a worldwide success. The novels have identical plots and even some identical episodes."<ref name="NYTimes" />

Author [[Frank Baker (author)|Frank Baker]] believed that du Maurier had plagiarised his novel ''The Birds'' (1936) in her short story "[[The Birds (story)|The Birds]]" (1952). Du Maurier had been working as a [[publisher's reader|reader]] for Baker's publisher [[Peter Llewelyn Davies]] at the time he submitted the book.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} When Hitchcock's ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' was released in 1963, based on du Maurier's story, Baker considered, but was advised against, pursuing costly litigation against [[Universal Studios]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.frankbaker.co.uk/biog.htm |title= Biography|publisher=Frank Baker|place= UK |access-date= 26 February 2013}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Du Maurier married Major (later [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]]) [[Frederick Browning|Frederick "Boy" Browning]] in 1932. They had three children:
* Tessa (b. 1933), who married Major Peter de Zulueta. After they divorced, she married [[David Montgomery, 2nd Viscount Montgomery of Alamein]], in 1970.
* Flavia (b. 1937), who married Captain Alastair Tower. After they divorced, she married [[Peter Leng|General Sir Peter Leng]].
* Christian (b. 1940), a photographer and filmmaker. He married Olive White ([[Miss Ireland]] 1961).

Biographers have noted that du Maurier's marriage was at times somewhat chilly and that she could be aloof and distant to her children, especially the girls, when immersed in her writing.<ref name=ft>{{cite news|last=Conradi|first=Peter J|title=Women in love: The fantastical world of the du Mauriers|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/4d0dc798-7f6e-11e2-97f6-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2MMsDkPDc|access-date=3 March 2013|newspaper=ft.com|date=1 March 2013}}</ref><ref name=Forster>[[Margaret Forster]], ''Daphne du Maurier: The Secret Life of the Renowned Storyteller'', Chatto & Windus.</ref> Her husband died in 1965 and soon after Daphne moved to [[Kilmarth]], near [[Par, Cornwall]], which became the setting for ''[[The House on the Strand]]''.

Du Maurier has often been painted as a frostily private recluse who rarely mixed in society or gave interviews.<ref name=Forster/> An exception to this came after the release of the film ''[[A Bridge Too Far (film)|A Bridge Too Far]]'', in which her late husband was portrayed in a less-than-flattering light. Incensed, she wrote to the national newspapers, decrying what she considered unforgivable treatment.<ref>[[Judith Cook]], ''Daphne'', Bantam Press.</ref> Once out of the public spotlight, however, many remembered her as a warm and immensely funny person who was a welcoming hostess to guests at [[Menabilly]],<ref name=Malet>[[Oriel Malet]] (ed.), ''Letters from Menabilly'', Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1993.</ref> the house which she had leased for many years (from the [[Rashleigh family]]) in Cornwall.

She appeared as a castaway in the BBC Radio programme ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'' broadcast on 3 September 1977. Her chosen book was ''The Collected Works of [[Jane Austen]]'', and her luxury was whiskey and ginger ale.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Desert Island Disks: Dame Daphne Du Maurier|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p009mzcr|access-date=2021-01-16|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

Du Maurier was an early member of [[Mebyon Kernow]], a Cornish nationalist party.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2017/06/duchy-original-cornish-national-consciousness-gets-stronger-by-the-year/|title=Duchy original: Cornish national consciousness gets stronger by the year {{!}} The Spectator|last=Watts|first=Andrew|date=3 June 2017|work=The Spectator|access-date=24 June 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>

===Alleged secret sexual relationships===
After her death in 1989, writers began spreading stories about her alleged relationships with various people,<ref name=ft/> including actress [[Gertrude Lawrence]], as well as her supposed attraction to Ellen Doubleday, the wife of her U.S. publisher [[Nelson Doubleday]].<ref name=Forster/>{{efn|Du Maurier's alleged affairs with Ellen Doubleday and Gertrude Lawrence were the subject of the 2007 [[BBC Two]] film, ''[[Daphne (2007 film)|Daphne]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Thorpe|first1=Vanessa|title=Du Maurier's lesbian loves on film|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/feb/11/books.media|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=11 February 2007|access-date=4 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Kregloeon|first1=Karman|title=BBC2's "Daphne" Explores Du Maurier's Bisexuality|url=http://www.afterellen.com/tv/13391-bbc2s-daphne-explores-du-mauriers-bisexuality|website=[[AfterEllen]]|date=May 21, 2007|access-date=4 January 2018}}</ref>}} Du Maurier stated in her memoirs that her father had wanted a son;<ref name=ft/> being a tomboy, she wished to have been born a boy.

''The Daphne du Maurier Companion'', edited by Helen Taylor, includes Taylor's claims that du Maurier confessed to her in 1965 that she had had an [[incestuous]] relationship with her father and that he had been a violent alcoholic.<ref>{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Helen|title=The Daphne du Maurier Companion|location=London|publisher=Virago UK|year=2008|ISBN=978-1844082353}}</ref>

In correspondence that her family released to biographer [[Margaret Forster]], du Maurier explained to a trusted few people her own unique slant on her sexuality: her personality comprised two distinct people – the loving wife and mother (the side she showed to the world); and the lover (a "decidedly male energy") hidden from virtually everyone and the power behind her artistic creativity. According to Forster's biography, du Maurier believed the "male energy" propelled her writing.<ref>Daphne du Maurier, ''Myself When Young'', Victor Gollancz.</ref> Forster wrote that du Maurier's denial of her [[bisexuality]] unveiled a "[[homophobia|homophobic]]" fear of her true nature.<ref name=Forster/>

The children of both du Maurier and Lawrence have objected strongly to the stories about their mothers' alleged intimate relationship. Two years after Lawrence died, a biography of her authored by her widower, Richard Aldrich, went into detail about a friendship between her and du Maurier that had begun in 1948 when Lawrence had accepted the lead role in du Maurier's new play ''September Tide''.<ref name="Aldrich, Richard 1954, pp. 307">{{cite book|last=Aldrich|first=Richard|title=Gertrude Lawrence As Mrs. A.|location=New York|publisher=Greystone Press|year=1954|pages=307–8}}</ref> Aldrich said that Lawrence had toured Britain in the play in 1948 and continued with it in London's [[West End (London)|West End]] theatre district through 1949, and that later du Maurier visited them at their home in the United States.<ref name="Aldrich, Richard 1954, pp. 307"/> Aldrich made no mention of a possible [[same-sex relationship]].<ref name="Aldrich, Richard 1954, pp. 307"/>

==Death==
Du Maurier died from heart failure on 19 April 1989, aged 81, at her home in Par, Cornwall,<ref name="ODNB"/> which had been the setting for many of her books. Her body was cremated and her ashes scattered off the cliffs around Kilmarth and Menabilly, Cornwall.<ref name=ODNB/><ref>Wilson, Scott.
