'''Thomas Campbell''' (27 July 1777{{snd}}15 June 1844) was a Scottish poet. He was a founder and the first President of the [[Clarence Club]] and a co-founder of the [[Literary Association of the Friends of Poland]]; he was also one of the initiators of a plan to found what became [[University College London]]. In 1799 he wrote "The Pleasures of Hope", a traditional 18th-century [[didacticism|didactic poem]] in [[heroic couplets]]. He also produced several patriotic war songs—"Ye Mariners of England", "The Soldier's Dream", "[[Battle of Hohenlinden|Hohenlinden]]" and, in 1801, "[[Battle of the Baltic (poem)|The Battle of the Baltic]]", but was no less at home in delicate lyrics such as "At Love's Beginning".

==Early life==

Born on [[High Street, Glasgow]] in 1777, he was the youngest of the eleven children of Alexander Campbell (1710–1801), son of the 6th and last [[Laird]] of Kirnan, [[Argyll]], descended from the [[Clan MacIver|MacIver-Campbells]]. His mother, Margaret (born 1736), was the daughter of John [[Campbell of Craignish]] and Mary, daughter of Robert Simpson, "a celebrated Royal [[Armourer]]".<ref>[http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/william-beattie/life-and-letters-of-thomas-campbell-volume-1-tae/page-29-life-and-letters-of-thomas-campbell-volume-2-tae.shtml Life and Letters of Thomas Campbell]</ref>

In about 1737, his father went to [[Falmouth, Virginia]] as a merchant in business with his wife's brother Daniel Campbell, becoming a [[Tobacco Lords|Tobacco Lord]] trading between there and Glasgow. They enjoyed a long period of prosperity until he lost his property and their old and respectable firm collapsed in consequence of the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Having personally lost nearly £20,000, Campbell's father was nearly ruined.<ref>[http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/william-beattie/life-and-letters-of-thomas-campbell-volume-2-tae/page-2-life-and-letters-of-thomas-campbell-volume-2-tae.shtml Life and Letters of Thomas Campbell]</ref> Several of Thomas' brothers remained in Virginia, one of whom married a daughter of [[Patrick Henry]].<ref>[http://www.clanmacfarlanegenealogy.info/genealogy/TNGWebsite/getperson.php?personID=I33728&tree=CC Campbell of Kirnan, Argyll]</ref>

Both his parents were intellectually inclined, his father being a close friend of [[Thomas Reid]] (for whom Campbell was named) while his mother was known for her refined taste and love of literature and music.<ref>[http://www.electricscotland.com/history/other/campbell_thomas.htm Significant Scots – Thomas Campbell]</ref> Thomas Campbell was educated at the [[High School of Glasgow]] and the [[University of Glasgow]], where he won prizes for [[classics]] and [[Verse (poetry)|verse-writing]]. He spent the holidays as a tutor in the western [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] and his poems ''Glenara'' and the ''Ballad of Lord Ullin's Daughter'' were written during this time while visiting the [[Isle of Mull]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}<ref>[http://www.poemhunter.com/thomas-campbell/ Thomas Campbell – Poemhunter]</ref>

In 1797, Campbell travelled to [[Edinburgh]] to attend lectures on [[Scots law|law]]. He continued to support himself as a tutor and through his writing, aided by [[Robert Anderson (author)|Robert Anderson]], the editor of the British Poets. Among his contemporaries in Edinburgh were [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]], [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Henry Brougham]], [[Francis Jeffrey, Lord Jeffrey|Francis Jeffrey]], [[Thomas Brown (philosopher)|Thomas Brown]], [[John Leyden]] and [[James Grahame]]. These early days in Edinburgh influenced such works as ''The Wounded Hussar'', ''The Dirge of Wallace'' and the ''Epistle to Three Ladies''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}<ref>[http://www.poemhunter.com/thomas-campbell/ Thomas Campbell – Poemhunter]</ref>

== Career ==
In 1799, six months after the publication of the ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'' of [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], "The Pleasures of Hope" was published. It is a rhetorical and didactic poem in the taste of his time, and owed much to the fact that it dealt with topics near to men's hearts, with the [[French Revolution]], the partition of [[Poland]] and with negro slavery. Its success was instantaneous, but Campbell was deficient in energy and perseverance and did not follow it up. He went abroad in June 1800 without any very definite aim, visited [[Gottlieb Friedrich Klopstock]] at [[Hamburg]], and made his way to [[Regensburg]], which was taken by the French three days after his arrival. He found refuge in a Scottish [[monastery]]. Some of his best lyrics, "Hohenlinden", "Ye Mariners of England" and "The Soldier's Dream" (which was later set by Beethoven),<ref>{{Cite web|title=25 Irish Songs, WoO 152 (Beethoven, Ludwig van) - IMSLP: Free Sheet Music PDF Download|url=https://imslp.org/wiki/25_Irish_Songs,_WoO_152_(Beethoven,_Ludwig_van)|access-date=2021-02-15|website=imslp.org}}</ref> belong to his German tour. He spent the winter in [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]], where he met an Irish exile, Anthony McCann, whose history suggested ''The Exile of Erin''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

He had at that time the intention of writing an epic on Edinburgh to be entitled "The Queen of the North". On the outbreak of war between Denmark and England he hurried home, the "[[Battle of the Baltic (poem)|Battle of the Baltic]]" being drafted soon after. At Edinburgh he was introduced to the first [[Gilbert Eliott, 1st Earl of Minto|Lord Minto]], who took him in the next year to London as occasional secretary. In June 1803 appeared a new edition of the "Pleasures of Hope", to which some lyrics were added.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1803 Campbell married his second cousin, Matilda Sinclair, and settled in London. He was well received in [[British Whig Party|Whig]] society, especially at [[Holland House, London|Holland House]]. His prospects, however, were slight when in 1805 he received a government pension of £200. In that year the Campbells removed to [[Sydenham, London|Sydenham]]. Campbell was at this time regularly employed on the [[The Star (London)|''Star'']] newspaper, for which he translated the foreign news. In 1809 he published a narrative poem in the [[Edmund Spenser|Spenserian]] [[stanza]], ''[[Gertrude of Wyoming]]'' – referring to the [[Wyoming Valley]] of [[Pennsylvania]] and the [[Battle of Wyoming|Wyoming Valley Massacre]] – with which were printed some of his best lyrics. He was slow and fastidious in composition, and the poem suffered from overelaboration. Francis Jeffrey wrote to the author:
<blockquote>
"Your timidity or fastidiousness, or some other knavish quality, will not let you give your conceptions glowing, and bold, and powerful, as they present themselves; but you must chasten, and refine, and soften them, forsooth, till half their nature and grandeur is chiselled away from them. Believe me, the world will never know how truly you are a great and original poet till you venture to cast before it some of the rough pearls of your fancy."{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
</blockquote>

In 1812 he delivered a series of lectures on poetry in London at the [[Royal Institution]]; and he was urged by Sir Walter Scott to become a candidate for the chair of literature at Edinburgh University. In 1814 he went to Paris, making there the acquaintance of the [[August Wilhelm von Schlegel|elder Schlegel]], of [[Georges Cuvier|Baron Cuvier]] and others. His pecuniary anxieties were relieved in 1815 by a legacy of £4000. He continued to occupy himself with his ''Specimens of the British Poets'', the design of which had been projected years before. The work was published in 1819. It contains a selection with short lives of the poets, and prefixed to it a critical essay on poetry. In 1820 he accepted the editorship of the ''[[New Monthly Magazine]]'', and in the same year made another tour in Germany. Four years later appeared his "Theodric", a not very successful poem of domestic life.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Later life==
[[File:Thomas Campbell statue, Glasgow.JPG|thumb|Thomas Campbell statue in [[George Square]], Glasgow]]
Campbell took an active share in the foundation of [[University College London]] (originally known as London University), visiting [[Berlin]] to inquire into the German system of education, and making recommendations which were adopted by Lord Brougham. He was elected Lord [[Rector of Glasgow University]] (1826–1829) in competition against Sir [[Walter Scott]]. Campbell retired from the editorship of the ''[[New Monthly Magazine]]'' in 1830, and a year later made an unsuccessful venture with ''[[The Metropolitan Magazine]]''. He had championed the cause of the Poles in "The Pleasures of Hope", and the news of the capture of [[Warsaw]] by the Russians in 1831 affected him as if it had been the deepest of personal calamities. "Poland preys on my heart night and day," he wrote in one of his letters, and his sympathy found a practical expression in the foundation in London of the [[Literary Association of the Friends of Poland]]. In 1834 he travelled to Paris and [[Algiers]], where he wrote his ''Letters from the South'' (printed 1837).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

His wife died in 1828. Of his two sons, one died in infancy and the other became insane. His own health suffered, and he gradually withdrew from public life. He died at [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]] on 15 June 1844 and was buried on 3 July 1844<ref>Record URL: http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?h=10186931&db=LMAdeaths&indiv=try  Source Citation: London Metropolitan Archives, Collegiate Church of Saint Peter, Westminster, Transcript of Baptisms and Burials, 1844 Jan-1844 Dec, DL/t Item, 099/032, DL/T/099/032.
