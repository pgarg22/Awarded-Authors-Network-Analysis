'''Christopher Abani''' (born 27 December 1966) is a [[Nigerian-American]] author. He says he is part of a [[Third Generation of Nigerian Writers|new generation]] of [[List of Nigerian writers|Nigerian writers]] working to convey to an English-speaking audience the experience of those born and raised in "that troubled African nation".

==Biography==
Abani was born in [[Afikpo]], [[Ebonyi State]], Nigeria. His father was [[Igbo people|Igbo]], while his mother was of [[English people|English]] descent.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/feb/18/entertainment/ca-abani18 |quote=But even before he became one of the rare Ugandans [sic] in the Phoenix Inn and one of the few blacks living in East L.A., Abani was what he calls 'an outsider's outsider'. He grew up in small Nigerian cities, the son of an Igbo educator father and a white English-born mother who had met at Oxford, where she was a secretary and he was a post-doc student. Raised Roman Catholic, Abani studied in the seminary as a teenager. |first=Scott |last=Timberg |title=Living in the 'perfect metaphor' |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=18 February 2007 |accessdate=25 January 2009}}</ref> He published his first novel, ''Masters of the Board'', in 1985 at the age of 16.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Chris Abani - Chris Abani Biography - Poem Hunter|url=http://www.poemhunter.com/chris-abani/biography/|website=www.poemhunter.com|language=en|access-date=2020-05-28}}</ref> It was a political thriller, the plot of which was an allegory based on a coup that was carried out in Nigeria just before it was written. He was imprisoned for six months on suspicion of an attempt to [[Soft coup|overthrow the government]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Abani, Chris 1967- {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/educational-magazines/abani-chris-1967|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2020-05-28}}</ref> He continued to write after his release from jail, but was imprisoned for one year after the publication of his 1987 novel ''Sirocco''.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Chris Abani {{!}} What You Need To Know About The Nigerian-American Legend|url=https://aceworldpub.com.ng/chris-abani-what-you-need-to-know-abou/|last=Ace|first=Micheal|date=2019-07-19|website=ACEworld Publishers|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-28}}</ref> After he was released from [[Prison|jail]] this time, he composed several [[Opposition (politics)|anti-government]] [[Play (theatre)|plays]] that were performed on the street near government offices for two years.
