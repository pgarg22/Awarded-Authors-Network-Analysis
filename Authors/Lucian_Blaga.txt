'''Lucian Blaga''' ({{IPA-ro|lut͡ʃiˈan ˈblaɡa|lang|Ro-Lucian Blaga.ogg}}; 9 May 1895 – 6 May 1961) was a [[Romania]]n philosopher, poet, playwright, poetry translator and novelist.

==Biography==

Lucian Blaga was a commanding personality of the Romanian culture of the [[interbellum]] period and in spirit - for his refusing to refuse to the normal values of Christian Idealist Romanian Philosophy at all cost, through his ressistence regarding obsessive decade - 50s - Communism through Romanian and Occident culture - in all postwar era influencing the circle poets, Nicolae Labiș and the 60s, or the religious poetry of The Burning Bush of Mother Maria up to contemporary times, - important Jewish names like Steinhardt or bornagain poetry, orthodox or Pentecostal, in the Commune Age - in all being a very valued author in his country, The National Theater of Cluj being named NT Lucian Blaga of Cluj, and from 1998 the Romanian state put Blaga on a 5000 Lei banknote, and since 2006, the current 200 Lei. He was a philosopher and writer highly acclaimed for his originality, a university professor and a diplomat. He was born on 9 May 1895 in Lámkerék (now [[Lancrăm]]), near Gyulafehérvár (now [[Alba Iulia]]), [[Kingdom of Hungary]], [[Austria-Hungary]], his father being an Orthodox priest. He later described his early childhood, in the autobiographical ''The Chronicle and the Song of Ages'', as "under the sign of the incredible absence of the word".

His elementary education was in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] at Szászsebes (now [[Sebeș]]) (1902–1906), after which he attended the "[[Andrei Șaguna]]" Highschool in Brassó (now [[Brașov]]) (1906–1914), under the supervision of a relative, Iosif Blaga (Lucian's father had died when the former was 13), who was the author of the first Romanian treatise on the theory of drama. At the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]], he began theological studies at Nagyszeben (now [[Sibiu]]), where he graduated in 1917. He published his first philosophy article on the Bergson theory of subjective time. From 1917 to 1920, he attended courses at the [[University of Vienna]], where he studied philosophy and obtained his [[PhD]].

Upon returning to [[Transylvania]], now a part of Romania, he contributed to the Romanian press, being the editor of the magazines ''Culture'' in [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]] and ''The Banat'' in [[Lugoj]].

In 1926, he became involved in Romanian diplomacy, occupying successive posts at Romania's legations in [[Warsaw]], [[Prague]], [[Lisbon]], [[Bern]] and [[Vienna]]. His political protector was the famous poet [[Octavian Goga]], who was briefly a prime minister; Blaga was a relative of his wife. He was elected a titular member of the [[Romanian Academy]] in 1936. His acceptance speech was entitled ''Elogiul satului românesc'' (''In Praise of the Romanian Village'').

In 1939, he became professor of cultural philosophy at the [[Babeş-Bolyai University|University of Cluj]], temporarily located in Sibiu in the years following the [[Second Vienna Award]]. During his stay in Sibiu, he edited, beginning in 1943, the annual magazine ''Saeculum''.

He was dismissed from his university professor chair in 1948 because he refused to express his support to the new Communist regime and he worked as librarian for the [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]] branch of the History Institute of the Romanian Academy. He was forbidden to publish new books, and until 1960 he was allowed to publish only translations. He completed the translation of ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'', the masterpiece of [[Goethe]], one of the German writers that influenced him most.

In 1956, he was nominated to the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} on the proposal of Bazil Munteanu of [[France]] and [[Rosa del Conte]] of [[Italy]], but it seems the idea was [[Mircea Eliade]]'s. Still, the [[Communist Romania|Romanian Communist government]] sent two emissaries to [[Sweden]] to protest against the nomination,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} because Blaga was considered an idealist philosopher, and his poems were forbidden until 1962.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} There are strong cultural indices to conclude that the novel Pasternak Boris published in Italy in 1957 and Rejected to Nobel in 1958 by PCUS was about Blaga, not Pasternak, living the Second Revolution in Romania of 1944+1948, and also it is that the fleuve novel The most loved of the earthbeings, 1980, by Marin Preda - that brought him sudden death the same year after publication and book withdrawal - was not only about the time in prison of poet Ion Caraion but on the European stature of Lucian Blaga. Out of Lucian Blaga innumerable pedologic realisations, the Byzantine Romanian man of culture of a moderate nature, and a political detainee since 1959 to 1964, boyar Al. ”Conu Alecu” Paleologu is his most profound passing-torch.

He was diagnosed with cancer and died on 6 May 1961. He was buried on his birthday, 9 May, in the countryside village cemetery of [[Lancrăm]], Romania.

He was married to Cornelia (née Brediceanu).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100710154435/https://romanialibera.ro/opinii/aldine/cornelia-blaga-brediceanu-diplomat-la-parisa-175333.html Cornelia Blaga-Brediceanu, diplomat la Parisa]. romanialibera.ro (22 January 2010)</ref> They had a daughter, Dorli, her name being derived from {{wikt-lang|ro|dor}}, a noun that can be translated, roughly, as "longing".

The [[University of Sibiu]] bears his name today.

==Philosophy==

His philosophical work is grouped in four trilogies:
* ''Filosofia cunoașterii'' ([[gnoseology]]) (1943)
* ''Filosofia culturii'' (culture) (1944)
* ''Filosofia valorilor'' (values) (1946)
* ''Filosofia cosmologică'' (cosmology) (1983 posthumously)

The fourth work, ''Cosmologica'', was completed but not published at the time because of communist regime censorship. Before death, Blaga left an editorial testament on how his works are to be published posthumously <ref>{{cite book |last=Blaga |first=Lucian |year=2013 |title=Trilogia cunoasterii |url=http://www.humanitas.ro/humanitas/trilogia-cunoa%C5%9Fterii |location=Bucharest |publisher=Editura Humanitas |isbn=978-973-50-3575-4 | pages=7–8 }}</ref>

The novel ''Charon's Ferry'' is intended to be a companion to the philosophical trilogies. In it Blaga addresses some of the more problematic philosophical issues such as those pertaining to political, (para)psychological or occult phenomena, under the name of a fictive philosopher (Leonte Pătrașcu).<ref>{{cite book |last=Blaga |first=Lucian |year=2013 |title=Trilogia cunoasterii |url=http://www.humanitas.ro/humanitas/trilogia-cunoa%C5%9Fterii |location=Bucharest |publisher=Editura Humanitas |isbn=978-973-50-3575-4 | page=8 }}</ref>
