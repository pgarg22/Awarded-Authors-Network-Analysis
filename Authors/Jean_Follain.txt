== Life ==
[[File:SignatureJeanFollain.jpg|thumb|180px|Signature of Jean Follain]]
Jean Follain was born in the small town of [[Canisy]] (province of la [[Manche]]), south of [[Saint-Lô]], where he spent his childhood. He attended a middle school (Collège, the title of a later prose work) where his father was professor of the Natural Sciences. In 1919 he went to [[Leeds]] in a vain attempt to improve his English, and in 1921 he began studying law at Faculté de [[Caen]]. For health reasons he was exempted from [[Conscription|military service]].

In 1927 he passed his [[bar exam]]s in Paris and started attending the meetings of the group "Sagesse" ("Wisdom") where he made the acquaintance of [[André Salmon]], [[Pierre Reverdy]], [[Pierre Mac Orlan]] and [[Max Jacob]].<ref name="Washington U"/> In 1933 he published his first collection with [[Eugène Guillevic]] and [[Pierre Albert-Birot]]. In 1934 he married painter Madeleine Dinès, a daughter of the [[Les Nabis|Nabi]] artist [[Maurice Denis]]. In 1939 he received the Mallarmé Prize. Jean Follain received the [[Prix Blumenthal]] in 1941, awarded to poets who refused to collaborate with the [[Vichy Government]].

In 1951 he gave up his career as a business lawyer and was appointed to the post of judge (magistrate) of the High Court in [[Charleville-Mézières|Charleville]].<ref>[http://www.ccic-cerisy.asso.fr/follainprg93.html LE MONDE DE JEAN FOLLAIN] Quote: ''...son expérience de magistrat,..'' Translation: ''...his experience as magistrate...''</ref> In 1949 he became a member of the Board of the "Pen Club". In 1957, he travelled to [[Thailand]] and Japan, and in 1958 he received the International Award of [[Capri]]. In 1960 he travelled to [[Brazil]], Peru and [[Bolivia]] and in 1966 to the United States. He also visited [[Côte d'Ivoire]] and [[Senegal]] in 1967. He resigned from the bench in 1961, attending to the cultural decade of [[Cerisy-la-Salle]] near [[Canisy]]. In 1970 he received the grand prize for poetry from [[L'Académie Française]].<ref name="prixjeanfollain"/> He died in Paris on 10 March 1971 when, returning from a banquet given by the Boat Touring Club, he was run over by a car shortly after midnight at the outlet of the tunnel of the [[Quai des Tuileries]]. He was buried on 16 March in Canisy.

The "Reading Association at Saint-Lô" and the city of [[Saint-Lô]] with the assistance of the Regional Direction of Cultural Affairs of the Lower Normandy Regional Centre of Letters and the Council General of France organise a biannual literary prize in his name: ''Jean Follain Prize in the city of Saint-Lô''.<ref name="prixjeanfollain"/>
