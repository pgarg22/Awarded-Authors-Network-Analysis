'''José Zorrilla y Moral''' ({{IPA-es|xoˈse θoˈriʎa}}) was a Spanish poet and [[dramatist]], who became National Laureate.

==Biography==
Zorrilla was born in [[Valladolid]] to a [[magistrate]] in whom [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] placed special confidence. He was educated by the [[Jesuits]] at the Real Seminario de Nobles in [[Madrid]], wrote verses when he was twelve, became an enthusiastic admirer of [[Walter Scott]] and [[François-René de Chateaubriand|Chateaubriand]], and took part in the school performances of plays by [[Félix Lope de Vega|Lope de Vega]] and [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca|Calderón de la Barca]].<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Zorrilla y Moral, José|volume=28|pages=1043-1044}}</ref>

In 1833, he was sent to study law at the University of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], but after a year of idleness, he fled to Madrid, where he horrified the friends of his absolutist father by making violent speeches and by founding a newspaper which was promptly suppressed by the government. He narrowly escaped transportation to the [[Philippines]], and passed the next few years in poverty.<ref name="EB1911"/>

The death of the [[satire|satirist]] [[Mariano José de Larra]] brought Zorrilla into notice. His elegiac poem, read at Larra's funeral in February 1837, introduced him to the leading men of letters. In 1837 he published a book of verses, mostly imitations of [[Alphonse de Lamartine]] and [[Victor Hugo]], which was so favourably received that he printed six more volumes within three years.<ref name="EB1911"/>

After collaborating with [[Antonio García Gutiérrez]] on the play ''Juán Dondolo'' (1839), Zorrilla began his individual career as a dramatist with ''Cada cual con su razón'' (1840), and during the next five years he wrote 22 plays, many of them extremely successful. His ''Cantos del trovador'' (1841), a collection of national legends written in verse, made Zorilla second only to [[José de Espronceda]] in popular esteem.<ref name="EB1911"/>

National legends also supply the themes of his dramas, which Zorilla often constructed by adapting older plays that had fallen out of fashion. For example, in ''El Zapatero y el Rey'' he recasts ''El montanés Juan Pascual'' by Juan de la Hoz y Mota; in ''La mejor Talon la espada'' he borrows from [[Agustín Moreto y Cavana]]'s ''Travesuras del estudiante Pa-atoja''. His famous play ''[[Don Juan Tenorio]]'' is a combination of elements from [[Tirso de Molina]]'s ''Burlador de Sevilla'' and from [[Alexandre Dumas, père]]'s ''Don Juan de Marana'' (which itself derives from ''Les Âmes du purgatoire'' by [[Prosper Mérimée]]). However, plays like ''Sancho García'', ''El Rey loco'', and ''El Alcalde Ronquillo'' are much more original. He considered his last play, ''[[Traidor, inconfeso y mártir]]'' (1845), to be his best play.<ref name="EB1911"/>

Upon the death of his mother in 1847, Zorrilla left Spain. He resided for a while at [[Bordeaux]], and settled in Paris, where his incomplete poem ''Granada'' was published in 1852. In a fit of depression, he emigrated to America three years later, hoping, he claimed, that [[yellow fever]] or [[smallpox]] would kill him. During eleven years in Mexico he wrote very little. He returned to Spain in 1866, to find himself half-forgotten and considered old-fashioned.<ref name="EB1911"/>

Friends helped Zorilla obtain a small post, but the republican minister later abolished it. He was always poor, especially for the 12 years after 1871. The publication of his autobiography, ''Recuerdos del tiempo viejo'' in 1880, did nothing to alleviate his poverty. Though his plays were still being performed, he received no money from them.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Finally, in his old age, critics began to reappraise his work, and brought him new fame. He received a pension of 30,000 reales, a gold medal of honor from the Spanish Academy, and, in 1889, the title of National Laureate.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} He died in Madrid on 23 January 1893.

In his early years, Zorrilla was known as an extraordinarily fast writer. He claimed he wrote ''El Caballo del Rey Don Sancho'' in three weeks, and that he put together ''El Puñal del Godo'' in two days. This may account for some of the technical faults—redundancy and verbosity—in his works. His plays often appeal to Spanish patriotic pride, and actors and audiences have enjoyed his effective dramaturgy. ''Don Juan Tenorio'' is his best-known work.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
