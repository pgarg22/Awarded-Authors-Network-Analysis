'''Elizabeth, Princess Berkeley''', sometimes unofficially styled '''Margravine of Brandenburg-Ansbach''' (''née'' '''Lady Elizabeth Berkeley'''; 17 December 1750 – 13 January 1828), previously '''Elizabeth Craven, Baroness Craven''', of [[Hamstead Marshall]], was an author and playwright, perhaps best known for her [[Travel literature|travelogue]]s. She was the third child of the [[Augustus Berkeley, 4th Earl of Berkeley|4th Earl of Berkeley]], and was born in Mayfair in the West End of London. 

==Works==
Early in her literary career she wrote a number of light [[farce]]s, [[pantomime]]s, and [[fable]]s, many of which were performed in London to no great acclaim. She knew [[Samuel Johnson]] and [[James Boswell]], and became a close friend of [[Horace Walpole]], who published her early works which, with later efforts, include:

* ''The Sleep-Walker'' (trans. of Pont de Vile's comedy ''La somnambule'', 1778)
* ''Modern Anecdotes of the Ancient Family of the Kinkvervankotsdarsprakengotchderns'' (satire, 1779)
* ''The Miniature Picture'' (play, 1781)
* ''A Journey through the Crimea to Constantinople'' (travel writing, 1789)
*  ''[http://www.etang.umontreal.ca/bwp1800/plays/craven_georgian/index.html The Georgian Princess]'' (produced 1798; published 1799). Ed. with an [http://www.etang.umontreal.ca/bwp1800/essays/franceschina_georgian_intr.html introduction] by John Franceschina. British Women Playwrights around 1800. 15 January 2001.
* ''Letters from the Right Honorable Lady Craven, to his serene highness the margrave of Anspach, during her travels through France, Germany, and Russia in 1785 and 1786'' (travel writing, 1814)
* ''Memoirs'' (1826)

Very few of her musical compositions survive:
*''O Mistress Mine'' (musical arrangement, about 1875)
*''The Princess of Georgia'' (opera, 1799)<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IvoQQU1QL_QC&pg=PA19 |title=The Norton/Grove dictionary of women composers|format=Digitized online by GoogleBooks|first1=Julie Anne|last1=Sadie|first2=Rhian|last2=Samuel|year=1994|isbn=9780393034875|access-date=10 October 2010}}</ref>

Her life was full of scandal: after thirteen years of marriage, seven children, and affairs reported on both sides, she and her first husband, [[William Craven, 6th Baron Craven|William Craven]], [[Baron Craven|6th Baron Craven]], (married since 30 May 1767), parted permanently in 1780.<ref>{{cite book |last= Huberty |first= Michel |author2=Alain Giraud |author3=F. and B.

Thereafter she lived in France and travelled extensively on the Continent.

For a number of years she maintained a romantic relationship with [[Charles Alexander, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach]]. During her years at the Ansbach court, Elizabeth formed an [[amateur theater]] at court, which counted the composer [[Maria Theresia Ahlefeldt]] among its members.<ref>"Dansk Kvindebiografisk Leksikon - Maria Theresia Ahlefeldt". kvinfo.dk. Retrieved 2014-09-21.</ref>  The wife of Charles Alexander since 1754, [[Princess Frederica Caroline of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]], died in Germany on 18 February 1791, and Lady Craven's husband died in [[Lausanne]] on 26 September 1791. The couple then married in [[Lisbon]] on 30 October 1791 and settled in England.

While the [[Margrave|Margravine]] was snubbed by ladies mindful of their reputations, as well as by her latest husband's cousin, King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] himself, and by Queen [[Marie-Antoinette]] when she visited France, the couple lived a full and opulent life in [[Hammersmith]], London, and [[Benham Park]] at [[Speen, Berkshire|Speen]] in Berkshire.

Nonetheless, Elizabeth was never legally entitled to share her husband's German rank and title: on 20 February 1801, she was granted the [[morganatic marriage|morganatic]] title of "Princess ''(Fürstin)'' Berkeley" by the last [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]].<ref name="Huberty 1988 135, 183">{{cite book |last= Huberty |first= Michel |author2=Alain Giraud |author3=F. and B. Magdelaine  |title= L'Allemagne Dynastique Tome V Hohenzollern-Waldeck |year= 1988 |location= France |language= fr |isbn= 2-901138-05-5 |pages= 135, 183}}</ref> In fact, Charles Alexander, being the last of his [[cadet branch]] of the [[House of Hohenzollern]], and childless, had exchanged his hereditary [[inheritance|birthright]] to the [[appanage]]s of [[Principality of Ansbach|Ansbach]] and [[Principality of Bayreuth|Bayreuth]] for an [[Life annuity|annuity]] of 300,000 [[guilder]]s from his ''[[pater familias]]'', King [[Frederick William II of Prussia]], a month after his second marriage.<ref name="Huberty 1988 135, 183"/>

In England, however, the couple were usually known as the "Margrave and Margravine of Brandenburg-Ansbach".{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

After Charles Alexander's death at Benham Park in 1806, Elizabeth moved to [[Naples]].  She died at Craven Villa in [[Posillipo]] and was buried in 1828 in the [[English Cemetery, Naples|English Cemetery]] at Naples. Her links with the Hammersmith area are commemorated in the name of two roads in the area – ''Margravine Gardens'' and ''Margravine Road''. There is a wall monument by [[Roubiliac]] to her in [[St Mary's Church, Scarborough]].<ref>{{NHLE |num=1258195 |accessdate=9 September 2014}}</ref>

Her children were:<ref>{{cite book|title=A Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of the Peerage and Baronetage of the British Empire|page=252}}</ref>
* [[William Craven, 1st Earl of Craven (1770–1825)|William]],  Major-general in the Army
* Henry Augustus Berkeley (b. 1776), Major-general in the Army
