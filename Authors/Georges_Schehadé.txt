'''Georges Schehadé''' (2 November 1905 – 17 January 1989) was a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] [[playwright]] and [[poet]] writing in [[French language|French]].

==Life and career==
Georges Schehadé was born in [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]], in an aristocratic [[Greece|Greek]] [[Greek Orthodox Church|orthodox]] family of Lebanese origin but spent most of his life in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]]. His sister was the novelist, [[Laurice Schehadé]]. He studied [[law]] at the American University of Beirut and became a general secretary at the ''Ecole Supérieure de Lettres'' in 1945.

In 1930, [[Saint-John Perse]] published Schehadé's first poems in the literary magazine ''Commerce''. During his first travel to Europe in 1933 he met [[Max Jacob]] and [[Jules Supervielle]]. After [[World War II]], he frequently stayed in Paris where he sympathized with the [[Surrealists]], especially with [[André Breton]] and [[Benjamin Péret]].

Between 1938 and 1951, Georges Schehadé wrote four small books of [[poetry]] that [[Gallimard]] published in 1952 under the title ''Les Poésies''.

The year before [[Georges Vitaly]] produced Schehadé's first play, ''Monsieur Bob'le'', at the [[Théâtre de la Huchette]], and it got very controversial reviews. Most critics didn't like it at all but several poets and actors – amongst them  André Breton, [[René Char]], [[Georges Limbour]], Benjamin Péret, [[Henri Pichette]] and [[Gérard Philipe]] – were very fond of it and wrote a couple of articles in ''Le Figaro Littéraire''.

In 1954, [[Jean-Louis Barrault]] produced his second play, ''La Soirée des proverbes'', that hadn't any success either. Only in 1956, with his third play, ''Histoire de Vasco'' (world premièred at [[Schauspielhaus Zürich]]), Schehadé wrote a work that was staged all over the world and translated into more than 25 languages. In 1974, the British composer [[Gordon Crosse]] (translation and libretto by [[Ted Hughes]]) made an opera out of this play: ''The Story of Vasco'', premièred by [[Sadler's Wells Opera]] at the [[Coliseum Theatre]] in [[London]].

From 1960 to 1965, Schehadé wrote three other plays, ''Les Violettes'' (1960), ''Le Voyage'' (1961) and ''L'Emigré de Brisbane'' (1965) that entered the repertoire of the [[Comédie-Française]] in 1967. It was his last play.

In 1985, after a long period of silence, Georges Schehadé published his last book of poetry, ''Le Nageur d'un seul amour'', a collection of poems he had written between the late 1960s and the early 1980s. He died on 17 January 1989 in [[Paris]] and was buried in the [[Cimetière du Montparnasse]].

Georges Schehadé was mentioned to have influenced [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]] in Taleb's youth, mentioned the postface of [[The Bed of Procrustes]].
