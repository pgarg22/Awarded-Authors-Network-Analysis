'''Larry Correia''' is an American fantasy and science fiction writer, known for his ''Monster Hunter'', ''Grimnoir Chronicles'', and ''Saga of the Forgotten Warriors'' series. He has authored or co-authored over 20 novels, has over 50 published short works, and has co-edited two published anthologies.

He was nominated for the [[John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer]] in 2011, and his works have been nominated for the [[Audie Award]] multiple times, winning twice. He has won the [[Dragon Awards|Dragon Award]] for Best Military Science Fiction or Best Fantasy Novel four times. In 2014, Correia started the failed [[Sad Puppies]] campaign to nominate works for the [[Hugo Award]], including his own, that he claimed were more popular but often unfairly passed over by voters in favor of more literary works or stories with progressive political themes.

==Early life==
Correia grew up in El Nido, California working on his Portuguese father's dairy farm until his mid-teens, when his family moved to Utah. He stayed in California for about a year before joining his family in Utah. While attending [[Utah State University]], Correia—who was raised [[Catholic]]—joined [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] and served a two-year mission in Alabama.<ref name="about">{{cite web | url=http://monsterhunternation.com/about/| title=About me | author=Correia, Larry | publisher=Monster Hunter Nation | date=2013 | access-date=June 14, 2014}}</ref>

After returning home from his mission, he got married before graduating with an accounting degree. He worked as an accountant for several years before Correia opened a gun store with business partners while continuing to work as an accountant. He also started working as a firearms instructor and a [[concealed carry|CCW]] instructor.<ref name="gun control article">{{cite web | url=https://monsterhunternation.com/2012/12/20/an-opinion-on-gun-control/ | title=An opinion on gun control | author=Correia, Larry | publisher=Monster Hunter Nation | date=December 20, 2012 | access-date=March 26, 2014}}</ref> In 2013, he began working as a writer full-time.<ref name="about"/>

==Writing career==
Correia's works often include magic and mythical monsters, such as vampires and werewolves. His stories are typically action-oriented with accurate and detailed depictions of firearms usage.<ref name="FantasyBookReview">{{cite web|url=http://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Larry-Correia/biography.html/|title=Larry Correia Biography|work=Fantasy Book Review|access-date=June 11, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213032822/http://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Larry-Correia/biography.html|archive-date=February 13, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Correia used to be active on firearms discussion boards, where he would write about his interest in weapons and low-budget monster movies, and also get inspiration from various online threads. The original rough draft of ''Dead Six'' appeared on one of these forums, "The High Road", in a thread started by Mike Kupari called "Welcome Back, Mr. Nightcrawler".<ref name="dead six origins">{{cite web|url=https://www.thehighroad.org/index.php?threads/welcome-back-mr-nightcrawler.207390/ |title=Welcome Back, Mr. Nightcrawler |author=Nightcrawler |date=June 26, 2006 |access-date=April 11, 2017 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6peckcqLq?url=https://www.thehighroad.org/index.php?threads%2Fwelcome-back-mr-nightcrawler.207390%2F |archive-date=April 11, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="419fw">{{cite web |url=http://www.419fw.afrc.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123293639 |title=Reservist, best-selling author team up for action-thriller |date=12 March 2012 |publisher=USAF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327102404/https://www.419fw.afrc.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123293639 |archive-date=March 27, 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

His self-published first novel, ''Monster Hunter International'', was written for—and marketed directly to—the posters on these boards. One of these posters had once worked in a large independent bookstore, and passed it on to his old employer—who in turn passed it to [[Baen Books]]—which offered Correia a publishing contract.<ref name="examiner 20151027">{{cite web|url=http://www.examiner.com/article/an-interview-with-monster-hunter-author-larry-correia |title=An interview with 'Monster Hunter' author Larry Correia |date=October 27, 2015 |first=Rob |last=Reed |website=Examiner.com |access-date=April 11, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202134930/http://www.examiner.com/article/an-interview-with-monster-hunter-author-larry-correia |archive-date=February 2, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> ''Monster Hunter International'', despite being self-published, reached the ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' bestseller list in April 2008, before he received this publishing contract.

==Sad Puppies==
{{main|Sad Puppies}}
Correia and [[science fiction]] author [[Brad R. Torgersen]] were leaders of the "[[Sad Puppies]]", a group of SF fans and authors who organized a voting campaign to nominate more works by conservative and libertarian authors, as well as classic "pulp" science fiction, for [[Hugo Award]]s. The Sad Puppies charged that these popular works were often unfairly passed over by Hugo voters in favor of more literary works, or stories with progressive political themes.<ref name=io9>{{cite web |last1=Anders |first1=Charlie Jane |title=The Hugo Awards were always political, but now they're only political |url=http://io9.com/the-hugo-awards-were-always-political-now-theyre-only-1695721604 |publisher=[[io9]] |access-date=31 July 2015}}</ref><ref name=apstory>{{cite news |last1=Italie |first1=Hillel |title=Hugo Awards reflect sci-fi/fantasy divide |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/9ceb65e5d2b14d1cb05dfc3ccb3d3340/puppies-attack-hugo-awards-reflect-sci-fifantasy-divide |access-date=31 July 2015 |agency=Associated Press |date=April 17, 2015}}</ref>  The campaign was ultimately unsuccessful and was discontinued in 2017.

==Works==
{{main|Larry Correia bibliography}}
Correia is best known for his ''Monster Hunter International'', ''Grimnoir Chronicles'', and ''Saga of the Forgotten Warrior'' series. The ''Monster Hunter International'' series chronicles the fictional adventures of the employees of Monster Hunter International, a company that hunts vampires, werewolves, zombies, and other monsters in order to protect the general public from them. The existence of these monsters is suppressed by a secret governmental organization known as the Monster Control Bureau. As the MCB is too small to handle all the monster hunting, they place bounties on the various monsters, and companies like MHI receive those bounties after proving they have eliminated them. The main character is Owen Zastava Pitt, a former accountant whose boss turned into a werewolf and tried to kill him. After nearly dying while dispatching his boss, Owen is recruited into MHI.

The ''Grimnoir Chronicles'' is an alternate history fantasy series set in the 1930s. In the world of ''Grimnoir'', magical abilities began manifesting in people in 1849. Most of those with magical abilities have very minor magic (about one in 100 people). About one in a thousand of those has major abilities and is known as an Active. The main character, Jake Sullivan, is a Heavy (he can manipulate gravity). He eventually joins the Grimnoir Society after finding the government is lying to him, working with them to stop the Imperium and the ambitions of Okubo Tokugawa.

In ''Saga of the Forgotten Warrior'', Ashok is a Protector, warrior monks chosen to enforce the law and root out anyone who is practicing the old ways. He is very good at what he does, until he finds out he isn't who he thinks he is, and that he's been lied to his entire life. He has to choose whether to hide the lies or to rebel against what he thought was right.

==Awards and recognition==
Correia has been nominated for and won multiple awards over his career.
