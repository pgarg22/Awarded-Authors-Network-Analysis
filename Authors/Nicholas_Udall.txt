==Biography==
Udall was born in [[Hampshire]] and educated at [[Winchester College]]<ref>Dr. Moberly's Mint-mark, C Dilke, Heinemann, 1965</ref> and [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]].  He was tutored under the guidance of [[Thomas Cromwell]], who mentions him in a letter to John Creke of 17 August 1523 as 'Maister Woodall' and he appears again in Cromwell's accounts for 1535 as 'Nicholas Woodall Master of Eton'.

After graduation from Oxford, he taught at a London grammar school in 1533.  He taught [[Latin]] at [[Eton College]], of which he was headmaster from about 1534 until 1541, when he was forced to leave after being convicted of offences against his pupils under the [[Buggery Act 1533]].<ref name="tudorplace.com.ar"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&UID=4498|title=Nicholas Udall}}</ref><ref name=fathom>{{cite web |url=http://www.fathom.com/feature/121749/index.html |first=Retha M. |last=Warnicke |author-link=Retha Warnicke |title=Sex and the Tudors |year=2002 |access-date=2007-05-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607152022/http://www.fathom.com/feature/121749/index.html |archive-date=7 June 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  The felony of [[buggery]], like all other felonies, carried a sentence of [[capital punishment]] by [[hanging]], but Udall wrote an impassioned plea to his old friends from Cromwell's household [[Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton|Thomas Wriothesley]] and [[Sir Ralph Sadler]], then joint [[Secretary of State (England)|king's Secretaries]], and his sentence was commuted to just under a year, which he served in the [[Marshalsea]] prison.  The pupils in question were not prosecuted.  A former pupil, the poet [[Thomas Tusser]], later claimed that Udall had flogged him without cause.<ref name="tudorplace.com.ar"/>

An adherent of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformed]] [[Church of England]], Udall flourished under [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] and survived into the reign of the Roman Catholic [[Mary I of England|Mary I]].  In 1547, he became Vicar of [[Braintree, Essex|Braintree]], in 1551 of [[Calborne]], [[Isle of Wight]], and in 1554 returned to teaching as headmaster of [[Westminster School]].

Udall died in 1556 and was buried in the churchyard of [[St Margaret's, Westminster]].  No monumental inscription can now be traced.

==Works==
Udall translated part of the ''[[Apophthegmatum opus|Apophthegms]]'' by [[Erasmus]], and translated in part and oversaw the English version of the ''[[Paraphrases of Erasmus#English|Paraphrases of Erasmus]]'', published in 1548 as ''[[The first tome or volume of the Paraphrase of Erasmus vpon the newe testamente]]''.  Other works he translated were [[Pietro Martire Vermigli|Pietro Martire]]'s ''Discourse on the Eucharist'' and Thomas Gemini's ''Anatomia''.  His most famous work, the play ''[[Ralph Roister Doister]]'', was probably presented to [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]] as an entertainment around 1553, but not published until 1566.

With [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]], he wrote a number of songs to celebrate the coronation of [[Anne Boleyn]] on 31 May 1533, using his [[Latinized name]] "Udallus".<ref name="luminarium1"/><ref>http://dev.hil.unb.ca/Texts/EPD/UNB/view-works.cgi?c=udallnic.1632&pos=1{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Likewise, he is the author of a Latin textbook, ''Flowers for Latin Speaking'' (1533), which utilizes material from his comedy as well as works by the Roman poet [[Terence]].

Udall wrote a propaganda tract in response to the [[Prayer Book Rebellion]] in 1549, entitled "An answer to the articles of the comoners of Deuonshere and Cornewall declaring to the same howe they haue ben sedused by Euell persons". This tract has sometimes been wrongly attributed to [[Philip Nichols (evangelical writer)|Philip Nichols]].<ref>Jonathan McGovern, "[https://academic.oup.com/nq/article-abstract/65/1/24/4796900?redirectedFrom=PDF Nicholas Udall as Author of a Manuscript Answer to the Rebels of Devonshire and Cornwall, 1549]", ''Notes & Queries'' 65, no. 1 (2018), 24-25.</ref>

It has been argued that Udall is the author of the interlude ''[[Respublica]]'', which was acted before Queen Mary in 1553.<ref>Empire and Nation in Early English Renaissance Literature (2008) by Stewart Mottram, pp. 170-208.</ref>

==Literary character based on him==
In [[Ford Madox Ford]]'s trilogy of historical novels, ''[[The Fifth Queen]]'', the character Magister Nicholas Udal is a decidedly heterosexual profligate, who serves as Latin tutor to [[Mary I of England]] and [[Henry VIII]]'s "fifth queen," [[Katharine Howard]].  He defends himself of charges that he was "thrown out of his mastership at Eton for his foul living" by claiming that he, a Protestant, "was undone by Papist lies."<ref>{{cite book
