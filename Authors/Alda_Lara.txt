==Biography==
Alda Lara was born on 9 June 1930 in [[Benguela]], [[Angola]]. She came from a wealthy family and received a Christian education, which gave her a spirit of liberalism according to one commentator. Her brother was the noted poet [[Ernesto Lara Filho]]. Lara attended a women's school in Sá da Bandeira (now Lubango) before moving to Portugal to finisher her secondary schooling.<ref name="luso">{{cite web|title=Biografia de Alda Lara|url=http://www.lusofoniapoetica.com/artigos/angola/alda-lara/biografia-alda-lara.html|website=Lusophonia Poetica|accessdate=6 November 2016|language=Portuguese|archive-date=7 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107092727/http://www.lusofoniapoetica.com/artigos/angola/alda-lara/biografia-alda-lara.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> She attended [[Lisbon University]] and resided at the Casa dos Estudantes do Imperio (House of the Students of the Empire). She had an active student life and began her writing career by publishing poetry in the literary journal ''Mensagem'', a publication specifically for Africans.
