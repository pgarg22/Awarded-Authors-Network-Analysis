'''Stefan Zweig''' ({{IPAc-en|z|w|aɪ|g|,_|s|w|aɪ|g}};<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/zweig "Zweig"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.</ref> {{IPA-de|ˈʃtɛ.fan t͡svaɪ̯k|lang|De-Stefan Zweig.ogg}}; 28 November 1881 – 22 February 1942) was an Austrian novelist, playwright, journalist and biographer. At the height of his literary career, in the 1920s and 1930s, he was one of the most widely translated and most popular writers in the world.<ref name="secretsuperstar">{{Cite web|url=http://moreintelligentlife.com/story/stefan-zweig-secret-superstar|url-status=dead|title=Stefan Zweig: The Secret Superstar|first=Julie|last=Kavanagh|work=[[Intelligent Life (magazine)|Intelligent Life]]|date=Spring 2009|archive-url=https://archive.today/20121208193830/http://moreintelligentlife.com/story/stefan-zweig-secret-superstar|archive-date=8 December 2012}}</ref>

Zweig was raised in [[Vienna]], [[Austria-Hungary]]. He wrote historical studies of famous literary figures, such as [[Honoré de Balzac]], [[Charles Dickens]], and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]] in ''Drei Meister'' (1920; ''Three Masters''), and decisive historical events in ''[[Decisive Moments in History|Sternstunden der Menschheit]]'' (1928; published in English in 1940 as ''The Tide of Fortune: Twelve Historical Miniatures''). He wrote biographies of [[Joseph Fouché]] (1929), [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary Stuart]] (1935) and [[Marie Antoinette]] (''[[Marie Antoinette: The Portrait of an Average Woman]]'', 1932), among others. Zweig's best-known fiction includes ''[[Letter from an Unknown Woman]]'' (1922), ''[[Amok (novella)|Amok]]'' (1922), ''[[Fear (Zweig novella)|Fear]]'' (1925), ''[[Confusion (novella)|Confusion of Feelings]]'' (1927), ''[[Twenty-Four Hours in the Life of a Woman]]'' (1927), the [[Psychological fiction|psychological novel]] ''Ungeduld des Herzens'' (''[[Beware of Pity (novel)|Beware of Pity]]'', 1939), and ''[[The Royal Game]]'' (1941).

In 1934, as a result of the [[Nazi Party]]'s rise in Germany, Zweig emigrated to England and then, in 1940, moved briefly to New York and then to Brazil, where he settled. In his final years, he would declare himself in love with the country, writing about it in the book ''Brazil, Land of the Future''. Nonetheless, as the years passed Zweig became increasingly disillusioned and despairing at the future of Europe, and he and his wife Lotte were found dead of a barbiturate overdose in their house in [[Petrópolis]] on 23 February 1942; they had died the previous day. His work has been the basis for several film adaptations. Zweig's memoir, ''Die Welt von Gestern'' (''[[The World of Yesterday]],'' 1942), is noted for its description of life during the waning years of the Austro-Hungarian Empire under [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]] and has been called the most famous book on the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]].<ref name="Manacorda 2010">Giorgio Manacorda (2010) [https://books.google.com/books?id=HSFf-UA19UwC&pg=PT15 ''Nota bibliografica''] in [[Joseph Roth]], ''[[Radetzky March (novel)|La Marcia di Radetzky]]'', Newton Classici quotation: "Stefan Zweig, l'autore del più famoso libro sull'Impero asburgico, ''Die Welt von Gestern''</ref>

== Biography ==
[[File:Stefan Zweig 1900.jpg|left|thumb|Stefan Zweig (standing) in Vienna with his brother Alfred (1879–1977), circa 1900]]
Zweig was born in Vienna, the son of Moritz Zweig (1845–1926), a wealthy [[Jewish]] textile manufacturer, and Ida Brettauer (1854–1938), a daughter of a Jewish banking family.<ref name="Lohrmann2003">Prof.Dr. Klaus Lohrmann ''"Jüdisches Wien.

Zweig studied philosophy at the [[University of Vienna]] and in 1904 earned a doctoral degree with a thesis on "The Philosophy of [[Hippolyte Taine]]". Religion did not play a central role in his education. "My mother and father were Jewish only through accident of birth", Zweig said later in an interview. Yet he did not renounce his Jewish faith and wrote repeatedly on Jews and Jewish themes, as in his story ''[[Buchmendel]]''. Zweig had a warm relationship with [[Theodor Herzl]], the founder of [[Zionism]], whom he met when Herzl was still literary editor of the ''[[Neue Freie Presse]]'', then Vienna's main newspaper; Herzl accepted for publication some of Zweig's early essays.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-features/1.637453|title=Meet the Austrian-Jewish novelist who inspired Wes Anderson's 'The Grand Budapest Hotel'|author=Gabe Friedman|date=17 January 2015|work=Haaretz.com}}</ref> Zweig, a committed cosmopolitan,<ref name="FirstThings">{{cite web |last1=Epstein |first1=Joseph |title=Stefan Zweig, European Man |url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/2019/06/stefan-zweig-european-man |website=First Things |access-date=1 June 2019}}</ref> believed in [[internationalism (politics)|internationalism]] and in [[Europeanism]], as ''[[The World of Yesterday]]'', his autobiography, makes clear: "I was sure in my heart from the first of my identity as a citizen of the world."<ref name="WoY">{{cite book |last1=Zweig |first1=Stefan |title=The World of Yesterday |date=1942|publisher=Plunkett Lake Press (ebook) |location=Chapter IX, paragraph 20 beginning "As a result": Kindle location code 3463 |chapter=Chapter IX: The First Hours of the War of 1914}}</ref> According to [[Amos Elon]], Zweig called Herzl's book ''[[Der Judenstaat]]'' an "obtuse text, [a] piece of nonsense".<ref name="elon">{{cite book|last=Elon|first=Amos|author-link=Amos Elon|title=The Pity of it All|url=https://archive.org/details/pityofitallhisto00elon|url-access=registration|year=2002|publisher=Metropolitan Books|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/pityofitallhisto00elon/page/287 287]|isbn=9780805059649}}</ref>

Zweig served in the Archives of the Ministry of War and adopted a pacifist stance like his friend [[Romain Rolland]], recipient of the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] 1915. Zweig married [[Friderike Maria von Winternitz]] (born Burger) in 1920; they divorced in 1938. As Friderike Zweig she published a book on her former husband after his death.<ref>{{cite book |title=Stefan Zweig – Wie ich ihn erlebte |first=Friderike|last=Zweig|author-link=Friderike Maria Zweig|publisher=F.

As a Jew, Zweig's high profile did not shield him from the threat of persecution. In 1934, following [[Hitler]]'s rise to power in Germany, Zweig left Austria for England, living first in London, then from 1939 in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]. Because of the swift advance of Hitler's troops westwards, and the threat of arrest or worse – as part of the preparations for [[Operation Seelöwe]] a list of persons to be detained immediately after conquest of the British Isles, the so-called ''[[The Black Book (list)|Black Book]]'', had been assembled and Zweig was on page 231, with his London address fully mentioned – Zweig and his second wife crossed the Atlantic to the United States, settling in 1940 in [[New York City]]; they lived for two months as guests of [[Yale University]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], then they rented a house in [[Ossining (village), New York|Ossining]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

On 22 August 1940, they moved again to [[Petrópolis]], a German-colonized mountain town 68 kilometres north of [[Rio de Janeiro]].<ref name="DW_30.04.2009">{{cite news|url=http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,4210755,00.html|title=Revivendo o país do futuro de Stefan Zweig|trans-title=Reviving the country of the future according to Stefan Zweig|language=pt|first=Júlia|last=Dias Carneiro|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=30 April 2009|access-date=23 February 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009175558/http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,4210755,00.html|archive-date=9 October 2012}}</ref> Zweig, feeling increasingly depressed about the situation in Europe and the future for humanity, wrote in a letter to author [[Jules Romains]], "My inner crisis consists in that I am not able to identify myself with the me of passport, the self of exile".<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/when-its-too-late-to-stop-fascism-according-to-stefan-zweig|title=When It's Too Late to Stop Fascism, According to Stefan Zweig|magazine=[[The New Yorker]]|date=6 February 2017|author=George Prochnik|access-date=10 September 2021}}</ref> On 23 February 1942, the Zweigs were found dead of a [[barbiturate]] [[Drug overdose|overdose]] in their house in the city of Petrópolis, holding hands.<ref name="Time1942">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1942/02/24/archives/stefan-zweig-wife-end-lives-in-brazil-austrianborn-author-left-a.html?sq=Stefan%2520Zweig&scp=10&st=cse|title=Stefan Zweig, Wife End Lives In Brazil|agency=[[The United Press]]|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=23 February 1942|access-date=28 November 2017|quote=Stefan Zweig, Wife End Lives In Brazil; Austrian-Born Author Left a Note Saying He Lacked the Strength to Go on – Author and Wife Die in Compact: Zweig and Wife Commit Suicide}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,773116,00.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101014145959/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,773116,00.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=14 October 2010|title=Milestones, Mar. 2, 1942|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=2 March 1942|access-date=28 November 2017|quote=Died.

His books banned by the Nazis, he fled to Britain in 1938 with the arrival of German troops, became a British subject in 1940, moved to the U.S. the same year, to Brazil the next. He was never outspoken against Nazism, believed artists and writers should be independent of politics.

"I think it better to conclude in good time and in erect bearing a life in which intellectual labour meant the purest joy and personal freedom the highest good on Earth", he wrote.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/feb/28/post-office-girl-stefan-zweig|title=Ruined souls|last=Banville|first=John|author-link=John Banville|newspaper=The Guardian|date=27 February 2009|access-date=8 August 2017|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

The Zweigs' house in Brazil was later turned into a cultural centre and is now known as [[Casa Stefan Zweig]].

Critical opinion of his oeuvre is strongly divided between those who praise his humanism, simplicity and effective style,<ref name="Lezard2009" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/szweig.htm|title=Stefan Zweig|first=Petri|last=Liukkonen|publisher=Kuusankoski Public Library|via=kirjasto.sci.fi|date=2008|location=Finland|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203214754/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/szweig.htm|archive-date=3 February 2015}}</ref> and those who criticize his literary style as poor, lightweight and superficial.<ref name="Walton2010" /> [[Michael Hofmann]] scathingly attacks Zweig's work. Hofmann uses the term "vermicular dither” to refer to a passage attributed to Zweig and quoted in 1972, though the passage does not occur in Zweig's published work. Hofmann adds that in his opinion "Zweig just tastes fake. He's the [[Pepsi]] of Austrian writing." Even the author's suicide note, Hofmann suggests, causes one to feel "the irritable rise of boredom halfway through it, and the sense that ''he doesn't mean it'', his heart isn't in it (not even in his suicide)".<ref name="Hofmann dither">{{Cite journal|last=Hofmann |first=Michael |author-link=Michael Hofmann |year=2010 |title=Vermicular Dither |url= http://www.lrb.co.uk/v32/n02/michael-hofmann/vermicular-dither |journal=[[London Review of Books]] |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=9–12 |access-date=8 June 2014}}</ref>

Zweig is best known for his novellas (notably ''[[The Royal Game]]'', ''[[Amok (novella)|Amok]]'', and ''[[Letter from an Unknown Woman]]'' – which was [[Letter from an Unknown Woman (1948 film)|filmed]] in 1948 by [[Max Ophüls]]), novels (''[[Beware of Pity (novel)|Beware of Pity]]'', ''[[Confusion of Feelings]]'', and the posthumously published ''The Post Office Girl'') and biographies (notably of [[Erasmus|Erasmus of Rotterdam]], [[Ferdinand Magellan]], and [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], and also the posthumously published one on [[Honoré de Balzac|Balzac]]). At one time his works were published without his consent in English under the pseudonym "Stephen Branch" (a translation of his real name) when anti-German sentiment was running high. His [[Marie Antoinette: The Portrait of an Average Woman|1932 biography]] of Queen [[Marie Antoinette]] was adapted by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] as a [[Marie Antoinette (1938 film)|1938 film]] starring [[Norma Shearer]].

Zweig acknowledged his debt to psychoanalysis. In a letter dated 8 September 1926, he wrote to [[Freud]], "Psychology is the great business of my life". He went on explaining that Freud had considerable influence on a number of writers such as [[Marcel Proust]], [[D.H. Lawrence]] and [[James Joyce]] giving them a lesson in "courage" and helping them overcome their inhibitions. "Thanks to you, we ''see'' many things. – Thanks to you we ''say'' many things which otherwise we would not have seen nor said." Autobiography, in particular, had become "more clear-sighted and audacious".<ref>[[Sigmund Freud]], Stefan Zweig, ''Correspondance'', Editions Rivages, Paris, 1995, {{ISBN|978-2869309654}}</ref>

Zweig enjoyed a close association with [[Richard Strauss]], and provided the [[libretto]] for ''[[Die schweigsame Frau]]'' (''The Silent Woman''). Strauss famously defied the Nazi regime by refusing to sanction the removal of Zweig's name from the programme <ref name="StraussZweigLetters">''Richard Strauss/Stefan Zweig: BriefWechsel'', 1957, translated as ''A Confidential Matter'', 1977</ref> for the work's première on 24 June 1935 in [[Dresden]]. As a result, [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]] refused to attend as planned, and the opera was banned after three performances. Zweig later collaborated with Joseph Gregor, to provide Strauss with the libretto for one other opera, ''[[Daphne (opera)|Daphne]]'', in 1937.

Zweig was a passionate collector of manuscripts. There are important Zweig collections at the [[British Library]], at the [[State University of New York at Fredonia]] and at the [[National Library of Israel]]. The British Library's [[Stefan Zweig Collection]] was donated to the library by his heirs in May 1986. It specialises in autograph music manuscripts, including works by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], and [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]]. It has been described as "one of the world's greatest collections of autograph manuscripts".<ref name="SZBLcollection">{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/music/musiczweig/musiczweig.html|title=The Zweig Music Collection|work=bl.uk}}</ref> One particularly precious item is [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s "Verzeichnüß aller meiner Werke"<ref name="BLMozartVerzeichnüß">[http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/ttp/mozart/accessible/introduction.html Mozart's "Verzeichnüß aller meiner Werke"] at the British Library Online Gallery accessed 14 October 2009</ref> – that is, the composer's own handwritten thematic catalogue of his works.

The 1993–1994 academic year at the [[College of Europe]] was named in his honour.

Zweig has been credited with being one of the novelists who contributed to the emergence of what would later be called the [[Habsburg Myth]].<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345783516|title=Europe's Malaise: The Long View|editor-first1=Francesco|editor-last1=Duina|editor-first2=Frédéric|editor-last2=Merand|chapter=The Habsburg Myth and the European Union|first=Helen|last=Thompson|author-link=Helen Thompson (political economist)|journal=Research in Political Sociology|publisher=[[Emerald Group Publishing]]|volume=27|pp=45–66|year=2020|isbn=978-1-83909-042-4|issn=0895-9935|doi=10.1108/S0895-993520200000027005}}</ref>

Friedenthal wrote that ''Balzac'' "was to be his ''magnum opus'', and he had been working at it for ten years. It was to be a summing up of his own experience as an author and of what life had taught him." Friedenthal claimed that "The book had been finished", though not every chapter was complete; he used a working copy of the manuscript Zweig left behind him to apply "the finishing touches", and Friedenthal rewrote the final chapters (''Balzac'', translated by William and Dorothy Rose [New York: Viking, 1946], pp.&nbsp;399, 402).
