===Writing===
While still in high school, Carroll published his first collection of poems, ''Organic Trains.''

Soon his work was being published in elite literary magazines like ''[[Paris Review]]'' in 1968,<ref name=NYer2010>{{Cite magazine |last1=Mallon |first1=Thomas |title=Off the Rim: Jim Carroll's "The Petting Zoo" |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|location=New York City|date= December 6, 2010 |pages=90–93 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/12/06/101206crbo_books_mallon |access-date=December 27, 2010 }}</ref> and ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'' the following year. In 1970, his second collection of poems, ''4 Ups and 1 Down'' was published, and he started working for [[Andy Warhol]]. At first, he was writing film dialogue and inventing character names; later on, Carroll worked as the co-manager of Warhol's Theater. Carroll's first publication by a mainstream publisher (Grossman Publishers), the poetry collection ''Living at the Movies'', was published in 1973.<ref>
