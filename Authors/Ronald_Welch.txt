'''Ronald Welch''' (14 December 1909 – 5 February 1982)<ref name=LCCN/> was the pseudonym of Welsh writer '''Ronald Oliver Felton''' [[Territorial Decoration|TD]], who wrote in English. He is best known for [[children's literature|children's]] historical fiction. He won the 1956 [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] from the [[CILIP|Library Association]] for the year's best children's book by a British author, for ''[[Knight Crusader]]'', the first in his so-called Carey Family series of novels.<ref name=medal1954/> He was born in [[Aberavon]], [[West Glamorgan]].<ref name=LCCN>[http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n50002435.html "Welch, Ronald, 1909–"]. Library of Congress Name Authority File (LCCN). Retrieved 24 May 2013.</ref> He was teaching at [[Bedford Modern School]] when the [[Second World War]] broke out. In 1940 he was commissioned lieutenant in the Welch Regiment, to which his pen name refers. He reached the rank of major and stayed in the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] after the war. He was for many years headmaster of [[Okehampton]] Grammar School in [[Devon]].

Welch's final work, ''The Road to Waterloo'', not strictly speaking part of the Carey family saga but closely connected to it in terms of subject matter, remained unpublished at the time of his death. It was not until 2018 that it was discovered among his papers and published in a special edition by Smith Settle.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://foxedquarterly.com/shop/ronald-welch-the-road-to-waterloo|title=The Road to Waterloo|website=Slightly Foxed|access-date=10 August 2019}}</ref>

==Carey family saga==
===Notes===
*The Carey family home is at [[Llansteffan Castle]] (or Llanstephan), [[Carmarthenshire]], Wales. The house may be based on [[Plas Llanstephan]].
*The home of the junior branch of the Carey family (descended from Rupert Carey) is at [[List of villages in Gower#Small communities|Horton]] Hall, on the [[Gower Peninsula|Gower]].
*The Carey family has a long-standing connection with the d'Assailly family of France. Neil and Richard Carey (and probably others) married a d'Assailly. The head of the family is the [[Marquis]] de Vernaye and the family home is near [[Graye-sur-Mer]] (see ''Escape From France'').
*The heir to the Earl (usually his eldest son) has the title [[Viscount]] Cilfrew (Cilfrew is a village near [[Neath]], [[Glamorgan]]). Holders of the title mentioned include Denzil and Bernard Carey.
*The books do not indicate a connection to the Scottish [[Duke of Aubigny]].
*The Carey [[coat-of-arms]] is a black hawk on a yellow background (see ''Bowman of Crecy'', ''For the King'').
*''Nicholas Carey''/''Ensign Carey'' and ''The Hawk''/''The Galleon'' are the only books that cover the same periods of time.
*The books contain explicit dates and historical events so the time period covered is usually easy to calculate
