'''Taliesin''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|t|æ|l|ˈ|i|ɛ|s|ᵻ|n}} {{respell|tal|YES|in}}, {{IPA-cy|talˈjɛsɪn|lang}}; {{Floruit}} 6th century AD) was an early [[Britons (Celtic people)|Brittonic]] poet of [[Sub-Roman Britain]] whose work has possibly survived in a [[Middle Welsh]] manuscript, the ''[[Book of Taliesin]]''. Taliesin was a renowned [[bard]] who is believed to have sung at the courts of at least three kings.

In 1960, [[Ifor Williams]] identified eleven of the medieval poems ascribed to Taliesin as possibly originating as early as the sixth century, and so possibly being composed by a historical Taliesin.<ref>''The Poems of Taliesin'', ed. by Ifor Williams, trans. by J. E. Caerwyn Williams, Mediaeval and Modern Welsh Series, 3 (Dublin: Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 1987 [repr. from 1968; first publ. ''Canu Taliesin'' 1960]).</ref> The bulk of this work praises King [[Urien Rheged|Urien]] of [[Rheged]] and his son [[Owain mab Urien]], although several of the poems indicate that Taliesin also served as court bard to King [[Brochfael Ysgithrog]] of [[kingdom of Powys|Powys]] and his successor [[Cynan Garwyn]], either before or during his time at Urien's court. Some of the events to which the poems refer, such as the [[Battle of Arfderydd]] (c. 573), are referred to in other sources.

In legend and medieval Welsh poetry, he is often referred to as ''Taliesin Ben Beirdd'' ("Taliesin, Chief of Bards" or chief of poets). He is mentioned as one of the five [[Literature of Wales (Welsh language)|British poets]] of renown, along with [[Talhaearn Tad Awen]] ("Talhaearn Father of the Muse"), [[Aneirin]], Blwchfardd, and Cian Gwenith Gwawd ("Cian Wheat of Song"), in the ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'', and is also mentioned in the collection of poems known as ''[[Y Gododdin]]''. Taliesin was highly regarded in the mid-12th century as the supposed author of a great number of romantic legends.<ref name=Griffin>Griffin (1887){{page needed|date=April 2012}}</ref>

According to legend Taliesin was adopted as a child by [[Elffin ap Gwyddno|Elffin]], the son of [[Gwyddno Garanhir]], and prophesied the death of [[Maelgwn Gwynedd]] from the [[Plague of Justinian|Yellow Plague]]. In later stories he became a mythic hero, companion of [[Bran the Blessed]] and [[King Arthur]]. His legendary biography is found in several late renderings (see below), the earliest surviving narrative being found in a manuscript chronicle of world history written by [[Elis Gruffydd]] in the 16th century.

Details of Taliesin's life are sparse. The first mention of him occurs in the Saxon genealogies appended to four manuscripts of the ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'' from 828AD. The writer names five poets, among them Taliesin, who lived in the time of [[Ida of Bernicia]] (fl. mid-6th century) and a British chieftain, (O)utigirn ([[Welsh language|Modern Welsh]] Eudeyrn).<ref>("At that time Talhaearn the Father of the Muse was famous in poetry, and Neirin, Taliesin, Blwchfardd and Cian who is called Gweinthgwawd, at one and the same time were renowned in British poetry." —''Gildas et Nennius'', ed. Mommsen, p. 205; Mon. Hist. Brit. p. 75), quoted in John Edward Lloyd, ''Dictionary of National Biography, 1885–1900, Volume 55''</ref> This information is considered fairly credible,<ref>Phillimore in ''Cymmrodor'', xi. 134–8; Zimmer, ''Nennius Vindicatus'', p. 78, quoted in John Edward Lloyd, ''Dictionary of National Biography, 1885–1900, Volume 55''</ref> since he is also mentioned by [[Aneirin]], another of the five mentioned poets, who is famed as the author of ''[[Y Gododdin]]'', a series of elegies to the men of the kingdom of [[Gododdin]] (now [[Lothian]]) who died fighting the Angles at the [[Battle of Catraeth]] around 600.

Taliesin's authorship of several odes to King [[Urien Rheged]] (died c. 590) is commonly accepted,<ref>[http://www.llgc.org.uk/index.php?id=254 National Library of Wales, article ''Taliesin'']</ref><ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=f899xH_quaMC&pg=PA1652&lpg=PA1652&dq=williams+canu+taliesin&source=bl&ots=p0TybdCsVG&sig=t9mf3qqw4JAKzODgnVqLDasFfBA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=VkXkVJWHDoat7Abp2oDYCg&ved=0CDoQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=williams%20canu%20taliesin&f=false J.

Taliesin also sang in praise of [[Cynan Garwyn]], king of [[Kingdom of Powys|Powys]].<ref>Ifor Williams, ''Canu Taliesin'' (University of Wales Press, 1960), poem I.</ref> Cynan's predecessor, [[Brochwel Ysgithrog]], is also mentioned in later poems.

According to legends that first appear in the ''[[Book of Taliesin]]'', Taliesin's early patron was [[Elffin ap Gwyddno]], son of [[Gwyddno Garanhir]], who was a lord of a lost land in [[Cardigan Bay]] called [[Cantre'r Gwaelod]]. Taliesin defended Elffin and satirised his enemy, the powerful [[Maelgwn Gwynedd]], shortly before the latter died (probably in 547 CE).<ref>Based on Phillimore's (1888) reconstruction of the dating of the ''[[Annales Cambriae]]'' (A Text) – see Phillimore, Egerton (1888), ''The Annales Cambriae and Old Welsh Genealogies, from Harleian MS. 3859'', in Phillimore, Egerton, Y Cymmrodor IX, Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion, pp. 141–183</ref>

According to the [[Welsh Triads]] Taliesin had a son, [[Afaon fab Taliesin|Afaon]], who was accounted a great warrior who suffered a violent death, probably in Lothian.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/triads2.html|title=The Welsh Triads|access-date=21 June 2016}}</ref> Taliesin's grave is held in folklore to be near the village of Tre Taliesin near Llangynfelyn<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.llangynfelyn.org/dogfennau/bedd_taliesin_mynegiad.html|title=Llangynfelyn – Bedd Taliesin – Taliesin's grave|access-date=21 June 2016}}</ref> called [[Bedd Taliesin]], but this is a [[Bronze Age]] burial chamber, and the village of [[Tre-Taliesin]], at the foot of the hill, was actually named after the burial chamber in the 19th century<ref>Owen & Morgan (2007) "Dictionary of the Place Names of Wales" p.475</ref> though legend was traced by [[Edward Lhuyd]] to the 17th century.

==Legendary accounts of his life==
[[File:Finding of Taliesin.jpg|thumb|"Finding of Taliesin" by [[Henry Clarence Whaite]], 1876]]
More detailed traditions of Taliesin's biography arose from about the 11th century, and in ''Historia Taliesin'' ("The Tale of Taliesin", surviving from the 16th century).<ref>*Ford, Patrick K. 1992. ''Ystoria Taliesin'' University of Wales Press: Cardiff.</ref> In the mid-16th-century, [[Elis Gruffydd]] recorded a legendary account of Taliesin that resembles the story of the boyhood of the Irish hero [[Fionn mac Cumhail]] and the [[salmon of wisdom]] in some respects. The tale was also recorded in a slightly different version by [[John Jones of Gellilyfdy]] (c. 1607). This story agrees in many respects with fragmentary accounts in the ''Book of Taliesin''.

According to the ''[[Hanes Taliesin]]'', he was originally known as '''Gwion Bach ap Gwreang'''. He was a servant of [[Cerridwen]] and was made to stir the Cauldron of Inspiration for one year to allow for Cerridwen to complete her potion of inspiration. The potion was initially intended for her son, [[Morfran]], who although was considered frightfully ugly, she loved nonetheless, and felt that if he would not grow in beauty then he should have the gift of the Awen to compensate. Upon completion of this potion, three drops sprang out and landed upon Gwion Bach's thumb. Gwion then placed his thumb in his mouth to soothe his burns resulting in Gwion's enlightenment. Out of fear of what Cerridwen would do to him, Gwion fled and eventually transformed into a piece of grain before being consumed by Cerridwen. However, this resulted in Cerridwen becoming impregnated with the seed and upon giving birth, she could not bring herself to kill the baby Gwion. She instead cast him into the ocean in a large leather bag, where he was found by [[Elffin ap Gwyddno|Elffin]], who named him Taliesin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/themes/society/myths_taliesin.shtml|title=The life of Taliesin the bard|publisher=BBC.com|access-date=23 March 2017}}</ref>

According to these texts Taliesin was the foster-son of [[Elffin ap Gwyddno]], who gave him the name Taliesin, meaning "radiant brow", and who later became a king in [[Kingdom of Ceredigion|Ceredigion]], Wales. The legend states that he was then raised at his court in [[Aberdyfi]] and that at the age of 13, he visited King [[Maelgwn Gwynedd]], Elffin's uncle, and correctly prophesied the manner and imminence of Maelgwn's death. A number of medieval poems attributed to Taliesin allude to the legend but these postdate the historical poet's ''[[floruit]]'' considerably.

The idea that he was a [[bard]] at the court of [[King Arthur]] dates back at least to the tale of ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'', perhaps a product of the 11th century. It is elaborated upon in modern English poetry, such as [[Alfred Tennyson|Tennyson]]'s ''[[Idylls of the King]]'' and [[Charles Williams (UK writer)|Charles Williams]]'s ''Taliessin Through Logres''. But the historical Taliesin's career can be shown to have fallen in the last half of the 6th century, while historians who argue for Arthur's existence date his victory at [[Mons Badonicus]] in the years either side of AD 500; the ''[[Annales Cambriae]]'' offer the date of c. 539 for his death or disappearance in the [[Battle of Camlann]], only a few years earlier than the date of 542 found in the ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]''. Taliesin also appears as a companion of [[Bran the Blessed]] in this era, by which time he was clearly perceived as a legendary figure who existed in many different times.

A manuscript in the hand of 18th-century literary forger [[Iolo Morganwg]] claimed he was the son of [[Saint Henwg]] of [[Llanhennock]]; but this is contrary to other tradition. In it he is said to have been educated in the school of Catwg, at Llanfeithin, in [[Glamorgan]], which the historian [[Gildas]] also attended. Captured as a youth by Irish pirates while fishing at sea, he is said to have escaped by using a wooden [[buckler]] for a boat; he landed at the fishing [[weir]] of Elffin, one of the sons of Urien (all medieval Welsh sources, however, make Elffin the son of Gwyddno Garanhir). Urien made him Elffin's instructor, and gave Taliesin an estate. But once introduced to the court of the warrior-chief Taliesin became his foremost bard, followed him in his wars, and wrote of his victories.<ref name=Griffin/>

===Literature===
His name was used, spelled as Taliessin, in [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]]'s ''[[Idylls of the King]]''.  He is a character in [[Thomas Love Peacock]]'s satirical, romantic 1829 novel ''[[The Misfortunes of Elphin]]'' where he is discovered as a baby floating in a coracle by Elphin (Elfin) who is fishing. In the 1951 novel ''[[Porius: A Romance of the Dark Ages|Porius]]'', by [[John Cowper Powys]], he is depicted as a politically astute court bard who is accomplished in both cookery and poetry.

He also makes an appearance in a number of works of modern commercial fiction that blend history and Arthurian legend, including quite a lengthy appearance in Bernard Cornwell's [[The Warlord Chronicles|''Warlord Chronicles'']] and [[Guy Gavriel Kay]]'s ''[[The Fionavar Tapestry]]''. In [[Stephen R. Lawhead]]'s ''[[The Pendragon Cycle]]'', he is most notable in the first book, eponymously named ''Taliesin'', in which he is depicted as Merlin's father. He is also a central character in ''[[Moonheart]]'', an [[urban fantasy]] novel by [[Charles de Lint]], and appears as the chief bard of the Kingdom of [[Prydain]] in the [[The Chronicles of Prydain|children's novels]] of [[Lloyd Alexander]] which are based on the Welsh ''[[Mabinogion]]''. The historical novel ''Radiant Brow – The Epic of Taliesin'' by H. Catherine Watling is based on "The Tale of Taliesin" and the poetry contained in ''The Book of Taliesin''. In the young adult fiction sequence ''[[The Dark Is Rising]]'' by British author [[Susan Cooper]], he guides young protagonists Will Stanton and Bran Davies through the Lost Land in the final book, ''[[Silver on the Tree]]''. Taliesin's harp-tuning key makes an appearance in "[[A String in the Harp]]" by [[Nancy Bond]], a time-travel story set in Wales. The key gives Peter Morgan, the main protagonist, the ability to see visions of Taliesin's life.

In [[Charles Williams (British writer)|Charles Williams]]' unfinished series of Arthurian poems, found in ''Taliessin Through Logres'' and ''The Region of the Summer Stars'', he is the central character, Arthur's bard and Captain of Horse, and the head of a companionship dedicated to Christian Charity in Camelot.

He is character in [[Traci Harding]]'s Chosen series starting with [[The Ancient Future Trilogy]] where he is an immortal time traveler trying to help the human soul mind evolution advance.

===Music===
The Norwegian classical composer [[Martin Romberg]] wrote a concerto for alto saxophone and [[orchestra]] in eight parts after the tale named "The Tale of Taliesin". The concerto was premiered in 2009 by [[Akademische Orchestervereinigung Göttingen]], with the Norwegian saxophonist Ola Asdahl Rokkones as a soloist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goettinger-tageblatt.de/Nachrichten/Kultur/Regional/Extravagantes-Programm-beim-Semesterkonzert|title= Göttingen, concert article from the world premiere of The Tale of Talisein|publisher= Goettinger Tageblatt.}}</ref> The work has since been published at Éditions Billaudot, Paris<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boosey.com/shop/prod/Romberg-Martin-The-Tale-Of-Taliesin/2289548|title= The Tale of Taliesin, Éditions Billaudot distributed by Boosey and Hawkes|publisher= boosey.com}}</ref> and played by Mittelsächsische Philharmonie, The Saint-Petersburg Northern Synfonia Orchestra and Nizhny Novgorod Philharmonic Orchestra, the two latter being conducted by Fabio Mastrangelo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvGHiyiODGk|title= Live Recording from concert in Freiberg |publisher= Youtube.com.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.music-nn.ru/afisha/06042018/|title= Presentation of the Nizhny Novgorod programe 2018 |publisher= music-nn.ru }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://musichallspb.ru/en/orchestra|title= Presentation of The Saint-Petersburg Northern Synfonia Orchestra programe 2016 |publisher= musichallspb.ru}}</ref>

In modern music, [[Deep Purple]]'s second studio album was named ''[[The Book of Taliesyn]]'' in honour of the bard. A track on the album ''[[Softs (album)|Softs]]'' by Canterbury prog-rock band [[Soft Machine]] is titled "Tale of Taliesin". [[Paul Roland]]’s 2006 album ''Re-Animator'' contains a song about the bard titled "Taliesin".
