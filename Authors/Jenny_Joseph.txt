<poem>
When I am an old woman I shall wear purple
With a red hat which doesn't go, and doesn't suit me.
And I shall spend my pension on brandy and summer gloves
And satin sandals, and say we've no money for butter.
I shall sit down on the pavement when I'm tired
And gobble up samples in shops and press alarm bells
And run my stick along the public railings
And make up for the sobriety of my youth.
</poem>|source = From "Warning" (1961)}}

Jennifer Ruth Joseph was born in [[Birmingham]] to Florence (née Cotton) and Louis Joseph, an antiques dealer. Her father's career led to the family relocating to Buckinghamshire where Jenny attended Badminton school. She won a scholarship to study English literature at [[St Hilda's College, Oxford]] (1950).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryarchive.org/poetryarchive/singlePoet.do?poetId=197|title=Jenny Joseph - poetryarchive.org|publisher=|accessdate=28 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730045411/http://www.poetryarchive.org/poetryarchive/singlePoet.do?poetId=197|archive-date=30 July 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> 

== Career ==
Her poems were first published when she was at university in the early 1950s.<ref>Couzyn, Jeni. ''Contemporary Women Poets''. Bloodaxe. 1985 p166</ref> She became a journalist and worked for the ''Bedfordshire Times'', the ''Oxford Mail'' and [[Drum (South African magazine)|Drum Publications]] ([[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]]).

Her first book of poems, ''The Unlooked-for Season'', won a [[Eric Gregory Award|Gregory Award]] in 1960 and she won a [[Cholmondeley Award]] for her second collection, ''Rose in the Afternoon'', in 1974.

== "Warning" ==
Joseph's best known poem, "Warning", was written in 1961 when she was 28. First published in ''The Listener'' in 1962, "Warning" was later included in her 1974 collection ''Rose In the Afternoon'', in ''[[The Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse]]'', and in her ''Selected Poems'' (1992). 

The poem became well known in America after [[Liz Carpenter]], (formerly the first woman executive assistant to Vice President [[Lyndon Baines Johnson]] and Press Secretary to former First Lady [[Lady Bird Johnson]]), wrote an article for the ''Reader's Digest'' in the early 1980s, about enjoying life having recovered from an illness, closing the article with "Warning". The poem was adopted by the greeting-card industry, led by graphic designer and calligrapher Elizabeth Lucas. Joseph ascribed the popularity of the poem "to her business acumen and energy I owe a hospitable following in California and later throughout northern America, more social, as I said, than literary.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Joseph|first=Jenny|date=1999-11-01|title=Jenny Joseph on the popularity of her poem “Warning”|url=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(99)90272-6/abstract|journal=The Lancet|language=English|volume=354|pages=SIII30–SIII32|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(99)90272-6|issn=0140-6736|pmid=10560651}}</ref> 

"Warning" was identified as the UK's "most popular post-war poem" in a 1996 poll by the [[BBC]]. 

The opening lines "When I am an old woman I shall wear purple, With a red hat which doesn't go, and doesn't suit me" was the inspiration for the [[Red Hat Society]].<ref>[http://www.redhatsociety.com/aboutus/howitstarted.html Redhatsociety.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717073522/http://www.redhatsociety.com/aboutus/howitstarted.html |date=2012-07-17 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Solomon|first=Mary Jane|date=22 October 2004|title=Crimson Tide Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A51463-2004Oct21.html|url-status=live}}</ref> 

Due to its popularity, an illustrated gift edition of "Warning", first published by Souvenir Press Ltd in 1997, has now been reprinted 41 times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.souvenirpress.co.uk/product/warning-when-i-am-an-old-woman-i-shall-wear-purple-jenny-joseph/|title=Warning: When I am an Old Woman I Shall Wear Purple|publisher=|accessdate=28 December 2016}}</ref> "Warning" was included in the anthology ''Tools of the Trade: Poems for new doctors'' (Scottish Poetry Library, 2014) and a copy was given to all graduating doctors in Scotland in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Warning by Jenny Joseph|url=https://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/poem/warning/|access-date=2021-08-21|website=Scottish Poetry Library|language=en-GB}}</ref>

Joseph herself hated the colour purple, which is why she included it in the poem.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

In 2021 the [[Bodleian Libraries]] in Oxford announced that the one millionth image from their collections to be digitised by the Digital Bodleian project was Joseph's first draft of "Warning".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bodleian Libraries reach the milestone of 1 millionth image online for public access|url=https://artdaily.com/news/138537/Bodleian-Libraries-reach-the-milestone-of-1-millionth-image-online-for-public-access|access-date=2021-08-21|website=artdaily.com}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Digital Bodleian–One Million Images|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFNwdbkTHlA|language=en|access-date=2021-08-21}}</ref>

== Personal life ==
In 1961 Joseph married Charles Coles. The couple had three children, Martin, Nell and Bec and ran the Greyhound, a west London pub, whilst Joseph continued writing. They eventually divorced and Joseph retired to Gloucestershire.<ref>{{Citation|title=Jenny Joseph reads her poem 'Warning'|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cACbzanitg|language=en|access-date=2021-08-21}}</ref> Her dedication of The Thinking Heart (1978) was “To my children, preventers of literature, life-savers”.<ref name=":0" />
