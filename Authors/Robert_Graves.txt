'''Robert von Ranke Graves''' (24 July 1895&nbsp;– 7 December 1985)<ref name=ODNB/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person.php?LinkID=mp01882 |title=National Portrait Gallery&nbsp;– Person&nbsp;– Robert Ranke Graves |publisher=Npg.org.uk |access-date=19 December 2010}}</ref> was a British poet, [[historical novels|historical novelist]], critic, and [[Classics|classicist]]. His father was [[Alfred Perceval Graves]], a celebrated Irish poet and figure in the [[Gaelic revival]]; they were both [[Celtic studies|Celticists]] and students of [[Irish mythology]]. Graves produced more than 140 works in his lifetime. His poems, his translations and innovative analysis of the [[Greek mythology|Greek myths]], his memoir of his early life—including his role in [[World War I]]—''[[Good-Bye to All That]]'', and his speculative study of poetic inspiration ''[[The White Goddess]]'' have never been out of print.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080411031247/http://greenmanreview.com/book/book_graves_whitegoddess.html] Review of ''The White Goddess – A Historical Grammar of Poetic Myth'' outlining different editions</ref>

He earned his living from writing, particularly popular historical novels such as ''[[I, Claudius]]''; ''[[King Jesus]]''; ''The Golden Fleece''; and ''[[Count Belisarius]]''. He also was a prominent translator of [[Classical Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek]] texts; his versions of ''[[The Twelve Caesars]]'' and ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' remain popular for their clarity and entertaining style. Graves was awarded the 1934 [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for both ''I, Claudius'' and ''[[Claudius the God]]''.<ref>James Tait Black Prize winners: [http://www.ed.ac.uk/about/people/tait-black/fiction Previous winners&nbsp;– fiction] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103060144/http://www.ed.ac.uk/about/people/tait-black/fiction |date=3 January 2010 }}</ref>

==Early life==
Graves was born into a middle-class family in [[Municipal Borough of Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], then part of [[Surrey]], now part of south London. He was the third of five children born to [[Alfred Perceval Graves]] (1846–1931), who was the sixth child and second son of [[Charles Graves (bishop)|Charles Graves]], [[Bishop of Limerick, Ardfert and Aghadoe]].<ref name=boy2>{{cite book|last=Boylan|first= Henry |year=1998|title=A Dictionary of Irish Biography, 3rd Edition|page= 152|location=Dublin|publisher= Gill and MacMillan|isbn = 0-7171-2945-4}}</ref> His father was an Irish school inspector, [[Gaels|Gaelic]] scholar and the author of the popular song "Father O'Flynn", and his mother was his father's second wife, Amalie Elisabeth Sophie von Ranke (1857–1951), the niece of the historian [[Leopold von Ranke]].

At the age of seven, [[classification of pneumonia|double pneumonia]] following [[measles]] almost took Graves's life, the first of three occasions when he was despaired of by his doctors as a result of afflictions of the lungs, the second being the result of a war wound and the third when he contracted [[1918 flu pandemic|Spanish influenza]] in late 1918, immediately before [[Demobilization|demobilisation]].<ref>Graves (1960) p. 234.</ref> At school, Graves was enrolled as Robert von Ranke Graves, and in Germany his books are published under that name, but before and during the First World War the name caused him difficulties.

In August 1916 an officer who disliked him spread the rumour that he was the brother of a captured German spy who had assumed the name "[[Armgaard Karl Graves|Karl Graves]]".<ref>Graves (1960) p. 172.</ref> The problem resurfaced in a minor way in the [[Second World War]], when a suspicious rural policeman blocked his appointment to the [[Special Constabulary]].<ref>Graves (1960) p. 281.</ref> Graves's eldest half-brother, [[Philip Graves|Philip Perceval Graves]], achieved success as a journalist and his younger brother, [[Charles Patrick Graves]], was a writer and journalist.<ref name=ODNB>Richard Perceval Graves, "Graves, Robert von Ranke (1895–1985)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004; online ed., May 2010 – [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31166, accessed 27 July 2010]</ref>

==Education==
Graves received his early education at a series of six [[preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory schools]], including [[King's College School]] in [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]], Penrallt in Wales, [[Hillbrow School]] in [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]], [[Rokeby Preparatory School|Rokeby School]] in [[Kingston upon Thames]] and [[Copthorne Prep School|Copthorne]] in Sussex, from which last in 1909 he won a scholarship to [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]].<ref>Graves (1960) pp. 21–25.</ref> There he began to write poetry, and took up boxing, in due course becoming school champion at both [[Welterweight|welter-]] and [[middleweight]]. He claimed that this was in response to persecution because of the German element in his name, his outspokenness, his scholarly and moral seriousness, and his poverty relative to the other boys.<ref>Graves (1960) pp. 38–48.</ref> He also sang in the choir, meeting there an aristocratic boy three years younger, [[George Harcourt Vanden-Bampde-Johnstone, 3rd Baron Derwent|G. H. "Peter" Johnstone]], with whom he began an intense romantic friendship, the scandal of which led ultimately to an interview with the headmaster.<ref>Graves (1960) pp. 45–52.</ref> However, Graves himself called it "chaste and sentimental" and "proto-homosexual," and though he was clearly in love with "Peter" (disguised by the name "Dick" in ''[[Good-Bye to All That]]''), he denied that their relationship was ever sexual.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bremer |first1=John |title=C.S.

==First World War==
At the outbreak of the [[First World War]] in August 1914, Graves enlisted almost immediately, taking a commission in the 3rd Battalion of the [[Royal Welch Fusiliers]] as a second lieutenant (on probation) on 12 August.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=29102 |date=16 March 1915 |page=2640 |supp= |nolink=y}}</ref> He was confirmed in his rank on 10 March 1915,<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=29094 |date=9 March 1915 |page=2376 |supp= |nolink=y}}</ref> and received rapid promotion, being promoted to lieutenant on 5 May 1915 and to captain on 26&nbsp;October.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=29177 |date=1 June 1915 |page=5213 |supp= |nolink=y}}</ref><ref>{{London Gazette |issue=29372 |date=16 November 1915 |page=11459 |supp=y |nolink=y}}</ref> He published his first volume of poems, ''Over the Brazier'', in 1916. He developed an early reputation as a war poet and was one of the first to write realistic poems about the experience of frontline conflict. In later years, he omitted his war poems from his collections, on the grounds that they were too obviously "part of the war poetry boom." At the [[Battle of the Somme (1916)|Battle of the Somme]], he was so badly wounded by a shell-fragment through the lung that he was expected to die and was officially reported as having died of wounds.<ref>Seymour (1995) p. 54.</ref> He gradually recovered and, apart from a brief spell back in France, spent the remainder of the war in England.<ref>Seymour (1995) pp. 58–60.</ref>

One of Graves's friends at this time was the poet [[Siegfried Sassoon]], a fellow officer in his regiment. They both convalesced at [[Somerville College, Oxford]], which was used as a hospital for officers. "How unlike you to crib my idea of going to the Ladies' College at Oxford," Sassoon wrote to him in 1917.

At Somerville College, Graves met and fell in love with Marjorie, a nurse and professional pianist, but stopped writing to her once he learned she was engaged. About his time at Somerville, he wrote: "I enjoyed my stay at Somerville. The sun shone, and the discipline was easy."<ref name="RGraves">{{cite book |last1=Graves |first1=Robert |title=Good-Bye To All That |date=1985 |publisher=Vintage International Edition |isbn=9780385093309 |pages=248}}</ref>

In 1917, Sassoon rebelled against the conduct of the war by making a public anti-war statement. Graves feared Sassoon could face a [[court martial]] and intervened with the military authorities, persuading them that Sassoon was suffering from [[shell shock]] and that they should treat him accordingly.<ref>Graves (1960) pp. 214–16.</ref> As a result, Sassoon was sent to [[Craiglockhart Hydropathic|Craiglockhart]], a military hospital in Edinburgh, where he was treated by Dr. [[W. H. R. Rivers]] and met fellow patient [[Wilfred Owen]].<ref>Graves (1960) pp. 216–17.</ref> Graves was treated here as well. Graves also suffered from shell shock, or [[neurasthenia]] as it was then called, but he was never hospitalised for it:<blockquote>I thought of going back to France, but realized the absurdity of the notion. Since 1916, the fear of gas obsessed me: any unusual smell, even a sudden strong scent of flowers in a garden, was enough to send me trembling. And I couldn't face the sound of heavy shelling now; the noise of a car back-firing would send me flat on my face, or running for cover.<ref>Graves (1960)  pp. 219–20.</ref></blockquote>

The friendship between Graves and Sassoon is documented in Graves's letters and biographies; the story is fictionalised in [[Pat Barker]]'s novel ''[[Regeneration (novel)|Regeneration]]''. Barker also addresses Graves's experiences with homosexuality in his youth; at the end of the novel Graves asserts that his "affections have been running in more normal channels"<ref>Barker, Pat, 1991. 'Regeneration' (Penguin, 2008) p.199</ref> after a friend was accused of "soliciting" with another man. The intensity of their early relationship is demonstrated in Graves's collection ''[[Fairies and Fusiliers]]'' (1917), which contains many poems celebrating their friendship. Sassoon remarked upon a "heavy sexual element" within it, an observation supported by the sentimental nature of much of the surviving correspondence between the two men. Through Sassoon, Graves became a friend of Wilfred Owen, "who often used to send me poems from France."<ref>Graves (1960) p. 228.</ref>

In September 1917, Graves was seconded for duty with a garrison battalion.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=30354 |date=26 October 1917 |page=11096 |supp=y |nolink=y}}</ref> Graves's army career ended dramatically with an incident which could have led to a charge of [[desertion]]. Having been posted to [[Limerick]] in late 1918, he "woke up with a sudden chill, which I recognized as the first symptoms of [[Spanish influenza]]." "I decided to make a run for it," he wrote, "I should at least have my influenza in an English, and not an Irish, hospital." Arriving at [[London Waterloo station|Waterloo]] with a high fever but without the official papers that would secure his release from the army, he chanced to share a taxi with a demobilisation officer also returning from Ireland, who completed his papers for him with the necessary secret codes.<ref>Graves (1960) pp. 231–33.</ref>

==Postwar==
[[File:Robert Graves home in Deià.jpg|thumb|The home of Robert Graves in Deià, Majorca]]
Immediately after the war, Graves had a wife, [[Nancy Nicholson]], and a growing family but was financially insecure and weakened physically and mentally:
<blockquote> Very thin, very nervous and with about four years' loss of sleep to make up, I was waiting until I got well enough to go to Oxford on the Government educational grant. I knew that it would be years before I could face anything but a quiet country life. My disabilities were many: I could not use a telephone, I felt sick every time I travelled by train, and to see more than two new people in a single day prevented me from sleeping. I felt ashamed of myself as a drag on Nancy, but had sworn on the very day of my demobilization never to be under anyone's orders for the rest of my life. Somehow I must live by writing.<ref>Graves (1960) p. 236.</ref></blockquote>

In October 1919, he took up his place at the [[University of Oxford]], soon changing course to [[English literature|English Language and Literature]], though managing to retain his Classics [[Exhibition (scholarship)|exhibition]]. In consideration of his health, he was permitted to live a little outside [[Oxford]], on [[Boars Hill]], where the residents included [[Robert Bridges]], [[John Masefield]] (his landlord), [[Edmund Blunden]], [[Gilbert Murray]] and [[Robert Nichols (poet)|Robert Nichols]].<ref>Graves (1960) pp. 238–42.</ref> Later, the family moved to Worlds End Cottage on Collice Street, [[Islip, Oxfordshire|Islip]], Oxfordshire.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/indiasprisonerbi00lago/page/194 <!-- quote=good bye to all that, "islip", robert graves, worlds end. --> India's prisoner: a biography of Edward John Thompson, 1886–1946]</ref> His most notable Oxford companion was [[T. E. Lawrence]], then a [[Fellow]] of [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls']], with whom he discussed contemporary poetry and shared in the planning of elaborate pranks.<ref>Graves (1960) pp. 242–47.</ref> By this time, he had become an [[atheist]].<ref>"In addition, between 1919 and 1924 Nancy gave birth to four children in under five years; while Graves (now an atheist like his wife) suffered from recurring bouts of shell-shock." Richard Perceval Graves, 'Graves, Robert von Ranke (1895–1985)', ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004; online edition, October 2006 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31166] (accessed 1 May 2008).</ref> His work was part of the [[Art competitions at the 1924 Summer Olympics#Literature|literature event]] in the [[Art competitions at the 1924 Summer Olympics|art competition]] at the [[1924 Summer Olympics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.olympedia.org/athletes/920477 |title=Robert Graves |work=Olympedia |access-date=23 July 2020}}</ref>

While still an undergraduate he established a grocers shop on the outskirts of Oxford but the business soon failed. He also failed his [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] degree but was exceptionally permitted to take a [[Bachelor of Letters|B.Litt.]] by dissertation instead, allowing him to pursue a teaching career. In 1926, he took up a post as a Professor of English Literature at [[Cairo University]], accompanied by his wife, their children and the poet [[Laura Riding]]. Graves later claimed that one of his pupils was a young [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]].<ref>Robert Graves (1998). ''Good-Bye to All That''. New York: Doubleday. p. 346.</ref> He returned to London briefly, where he separated from his wife under highly emotional circumstances (at one point Riding attempted suicide) before leaving to live with Riding in [[Deià]], [[Majorca]]. There they continued to publish letterpress books under the rubric of the [[Seizin Press]], founded and edited the literary journal, ''Epilogue'' and wrote two successful academic books together: ''A Survey of Modernist Poetry'' (1927) and ''A Pamphlet Against Anthologies'' (1928); both had great influence on modern literary criticism, particularly [[New Criticism]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Birth of New Criticism: Conflict and Conciliation in the Early Work of William Empson, I.A. Richards, Robert Graves, and Laura Riding|last=Childs|first=Donald J|date=2014|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|language=en|oclc = 941601073}}</ref>

==Literary career==
In 1927, he published ''Lawrence and the Arabs'', a commercially successful biography of [[T. E. Lawrence]]. The autobiographical ''[[Good-Bye to All That]]'' (1929, revised by him and republished in 1957) proved a success but cost him many of his friends, notably Siegfried Sassoon. In 1934 he published his most commercially successful work, ''[[I, Claudius]]''. Using classical sources (under the advice of classics scholar [[Eirlys Roberts]])<ref name=SObit>{{cite work|work=[[The Scotsman]]|date=9 April 2008|title=Obituary: Eirlys Roberts|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/eirlys-roberts-1-1163142|access-date=2 November 2017}}</ref> he constructed a complex and compelling tale of the life of the Roman emperor [[Claudius]], a tale extended in the sequel ''[[Claudius the God]]'' (1935). The Claudius books were turned into the very popular television series ''[[I, Claudius (TV series)|I, Claudius]]'' shown in both Britain and United States in the 1970s. Another historical novel by Graves, ''[[Count Belisarius]]'' (1938), recounts the career of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] general [[Belisarius]].

Graves and Riding left Majorca in 1936 at the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]] and in 1939, they moved to the United States, taking lodging in [[New Hope, Pennsylvania|New Hope]], Pennsylvania. Their volatile relationship and eventual breakup was described by Robert's nephew [[Richard Perceval Graves]] in ''Robert Graves: 1927–1940: the Years with Laura'', and T. S. Matthews's ''Jacks or Better'' (1977). It was also the basis for [[Miranda Seymour]]'s novel ''The Summer of '39'' (1998).

After returning to Britain, Graves began a relationship with Beryl Hodge, the wife of [[Alan Hodge]], his collaborator on ''[[The Long Week-End]]'' (1940) and ''[[The Reader Over Your Shoulder]]'' (1943; republished in 1947 as ''The Use and Abuse of the English Language'' but subsequently republished several times under its original title). In 1946, he and Beryl (they were not to marry until 1950) re-established a home with their three children, in [[Deià]], Majorca. The house is now a museum. The year 1946 also saw the publication of his historical novel ''[[King Jesus]]''. He published ''[[The White Goddess]]: A Historical Grammar of Poetic Myth'' in 1948; it is a study of the nature of poetic inspiration, interpreted in terms of the classical and Celtic mythology he knew so well.<ref>Seymour (1996) pp. 306–12</ref> He turned to science fiction with ''[[Seven Days in New Crete]]'' (1949) and in 1953 he published ''The Nazarene Gospel Restored'' with Joshua Podro. He also wrote ''[[Hercules, My Shipmate]]'', published under that name in 1945 (but first published as ''The Golden Fleece'' in 1944).

In 1955, he published ''[[The Greek Myths]]'', which retells a large body of Greek myths, each tale followed by extensive commentary drawn from the system of ''The White Goddess''. His retellings are well respected; many of his unconventional interpretations and etymologies are dismissed by classicists.<ref>''"[it] makes attractive reading and conveys much solid information, but should be approached with extreme caution nonetheless"''. (Robin Hard, H. J. Rose, ''The Routledge Handbook of Greek Mythology'', p. 690. {{ISBN|0-415-18636-6}}.) See ''[[The Greek Myths]]''</ref> Graves in turn dismissed the reactions of classical scholars, arguing that they are too specialised and "prose-minded" to interpret "ancient poetic meaning," and that "the few independent thinkers&nbsp;... [are] the poets, who try to keep civilisation alive."<ref>''The White Goddess'', Farrar Straus Giroux, p. 224. {{ISBN|0-374-50493-8}}</ref>

He published a volume of short stories, ''Catacrok! Mostly Stories, Mostly Funny'', in 1956. In 1961 he became Professor of Poetry at Oxford, a post he held until 1966.

In 1967, Robert Graves published, together with [[Omar Ali-Shah]], a new translation of the ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]''.<ref>Graves, Robert, Ali-Shah, Omar: ''The Original Rubaiyyat of Omar Khayyam'', {{ISBN|0-14-003408-0|0-912358-38-6}}</ref><ref name=eagle>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090121003133/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,844564,00.html Stuffed Eagle], ''Time'', 31 May 1968</ref> The translation quickly became controversial; Graves was attacked for trying to break the spell of famed passages in [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward FitzGerald]]'s Victorian translation, and L. P. Elwell-Sutton, an orientalist at [[Edinburgh University]], maintained that the manuscript used by Ali-Shah and Graves, which Ali-Shah and his brother [[Idries Shah]] claimed had been in their family for 800 years, was a forgery.<ref name=eagle /> The translation was a critical disaster and Graves's reputation suffered severely due to what the public perceived as his gullibility in falling for the Shah brothers' deception.<ref name=eagle /><ref name=Graves>{{cite book|last=Graves|first=Richard Perceval|title=Robert Graves and the White Goddess: The White Goddess, 1940–1985|publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson|year=1995|location=London|pages=[https://archive.org/details/robertgraveswhi00grav/page/446 446]–47, 468–72|url=https://archive.org/details/robertgraveswhi00grav|url-access=limited|isbn=0-231-10966-0}}</ref>

From the 1960s until his death, Robert Graves frequently exchanged letters with [[Spike Milligan]]. Many of their letters to each other are collected in the book, ''Dear Robert, Dear Spike''.<ref>National Library of Australia ''NLA News'' June 2002 Volume XII, Number 9. Retrieved 15 June 2007 [http://www.nla.gov.au/pub/nlanews/2002/jun02/article1.html National Library of Australia newsletter (June 2002)]</ref>

On 11 November 1985, Graves was among sixteen Great War poets commemorated on a slate stone unveiled in [[Westminster Abbey]]'s [[Poets' Corner]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://net.lib.byu.edu/english/wwi/poets/poets.html |title=Poets |publisher=Net.lib.byu.edu |access-date=19 December 2010}}</ref> The inscription on the stone was written by friend and fellow Great War poet [[Wilfred Owen]]. It reads: "My subject is War, and the pity of War. The Poetry is in the pity."<ref>[http://net.lib.byu.edu/english/wwi/poets/Preface.html BYU library archive]</ref> Of the 16 poets, Graves was the only one still living at the time of the commemoration ceremony.

UK government documents released in 2012 indicate that Graves turned down a [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in 1957.<ref>http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files/resources/document2012-01-24-075439.pdf</ref> In 2012 the Nobel Records were opened after 50 years, and it was revealed that Graves was among a shortlist of authors considered for the 1962 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], along with [[John Steinbeck]] (who was that year's recipient of the prize), [[Lawrence Durrell]], [[Jean Anouilh]] and [[Karen Blixen]].<ref name=floodjan2013>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/03/swedish-academy-controversy-steinbeck-nobel |title=Swedish Academy reopens controversy surrounding Steinbeck's Nobel prize |work=[[The Guardian]] |author=Alison Flood |date=3 January 2013 |access-date=3 January 2013}}</ref> Graves was rejected because, even though he had written several historical novels, he was still primarily seen as a poet, and committee member [[Henry Olsson]] was reluctant to award any Anglo-Saxon poet the prize before the death of [[Ezra Pound]], believing that other writers did not match his talent.<ref name=floodjan2013/>

In 2017 [[Seven Stories Press]] began its Robert Graves Project. Fourteen of Graves's out-of-print books will be republished over the next three years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2018/01/04/the-reader-over-your-shoulder/|title=The Reader Over Your Shoulder|last=O'Conner|first=Patricia T.|date=4 January 2018|website=The Paris Review|access-date=11 January 2018}}</ref> ''The Reader Over Your Shoulder'' was the first adult title in Graves's oeuvre, published 9 January 2018. ''Ann at Highwood Hall'', a children's book, was published in July 2017.

==Sexuality==
Robert Graves was [[bisexual]], having intense romantic relationships with both men and women, though the word he coined for it was "pseudo-homosexual."<ref>Graves, ''Robert. Good-Bye to All That''. Penguin Group (Australia), 2014, p. 33</ref> Graves was raised to be "prudishly innocent, as my mother had planned I should be."<ref>Graves (2014), p. 58</ref> His mother, Amy, forbade speaking about sex, save in a "gruesome" context, and all skin "must be covered."<ref>Seymour (2003), p. 16</ref> At his days in Penrallt, he had "innocent crushes" on boys; one in particular was a boy named Ronny, who "climbed trees, killed pigeons with a catapult and broke all the school rules while never seeming to get caught."<ref>Seymour (2003), p. 18</ref><ref>Graves (2014), p. 31</ref> At Charterhouse, an all-boys school, it was common for boys to develop "amorous but seldom erotic" relationships, which the headmaster mostly ignored.<ref>Graves (2014), p. 60</ref> Graves described boxing with a friend, Raymond Rodakowski, as having a "a lot of sex feeling".<ref>Graves (2014), p. 69</ref> And although Graves admitted to loving Raymond, he would dismiss it as "more comradely than amorous."<ref name="Graves 2014, p. 70">Graves (2014), p. 70</ref>

In his fourth year at Charterhouse, Graves would meet "Dick" (George "Peter" Harcourt Johnstone) with whom he would develop "an even stronger relationship".<ref name="Graves 2014, p. 70"/> Johnstone was an object of adoration in Graves's early poems. Graves's feelings for Johnstone were exploited by bullies, who led Graves to believe that Johnstone was seen kissing the choir-master. Graves, jealous, demanded the choir-master's resignation.<ref>Seymour (2003), p. 27–28</ref> During the First World War, Johnstone remained a "solace" to Graves. Despite Graves's own "pure and innocent" view of Johnstone, Graves's cousin Gerald wrote in a letter that Johnstone was: "not at all the innocent fellow I took him for, but as bad as anyone could be".<ref>Seymour (2003), p. 45</ref> Johnstone remained a subject for Graves's poems despite this. Communication between them ended when Johnstone's mother found their letters and forbade further contact with Graves.<ref>Seymour (2003), p. 51–52</ref> Johnstone would later be arrested for attempting to seduce a Canadian soldier, which removed Graves's denial about Johnstone's infidelity, causing Graves to collapse.<ref>Seymour (2003), p. 65</ref>

In 1917, Graves met Marjorie Machin, an auxiliary nurse from Kent. He admired her "direct manner and practical approach to life". Graves did not pursue the relationship when he realised Machin had a fiancé on the Front.<ref name="Seymour 2003, p. 63">Seymour (2003), p. 63</ref> This began a period where Graves would begin to take interest in women with more masculine traits.<ref name="Seymour 2003, p. 63"/> Nancy Nicholson, his future wife, was an ardent feminist: she kept her hair short, wore trousers, and had "boyish directness and youth."<ref>Seymour (2003), p. 59–68</ref> Her feminism never conflicted with Graves's own ideas of female superiority.<ref>Seymour (2003), p. 68</ref> Siegfried Sassoon, who felt as if Graves and he had a relationship of a fashion, felt betrayed by Graves's new relationship and declined to go to the wedding.<ref>Seymour (2003), p. 72</ref> Graves apparently never loved Sassoon in the same fashion that Sassoon loved Graves.<ref>Seymour (2003), p. 111</ref>

Graves's and Nicholson's marriage was strained, with Graves living with "[[shell shock]]", and having an insatiable need for sex, which Nicholson did not reciprocate.<ref>Seymour (2003), p. 80/114</ref> Nancy forbade any mention of the war, which added to the conflict.<ref>Seymour (2003), p. 80</ref> In 1926, he would meet Laura Riding, with whom he would run away in 1929 while still married to Nicholson. Prior to this, Graves, Riding and Nicholson would attempt a triadic relationship called "The Trinity." Despite the implications, Riding and Nicholson were most likely heterosexual.<ref>Seymour (2003), p. 143</ref> This triangle became the "Holy Circle" with the addition of Irish poet [[Geoffrey Phibbs]], who himself was still married to Irish artist [[Norah McGuinness]].<ref>Seymour (2003), p. 163</ref> This relationship revolved around the worship and reverence of Riding. Graves and Phibbs were both to sleep with Riding.<ref>Seymour (2003), p. 167–168</ref> When Phibbs attempted to leave the relationship, Graves was sent to track him down, even threatening to kill Phibbs if he did not return to the circle.<ref>Seymour (2003), p. 172</ref> When Phibbs resisted, Laura threw herself out of a window, with Graves following suit to reach her.<ref>Seymour (2003), p. 178</ref> Graves's commitment to Riding was so strong that he entered, on her word, a period of enforced celibacy, "which he had not enjoyed".<ref>Seymour (2003), p. 201</ref>

By 1938, no longer entranced by Riding, Graves fell in love with the then-married Beryl Hodge. In 1950, after much dispute with Nicholson (whom he had not divorced yet), he married Beryl.<ref>Seymour (2003), p. 287</ref> Despite having a loving marriage with Beryl, Graves would take on a 17-year-old muse, Judith Bledsoe, in 1950.<ref>Seymour (2003), p. 332</ref> Although the relationship would be described as "not overtly sexual", Graves would later in 1952 attack Judith's new fiancé, getting the police called on him in the process.<ref>Seymour (2003), p. 336</ref> He would later have three successive female muses, who came to dominate his poetry.<ref>Seymour (2003), p. 388</ref>

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Lápida Robert Graves.jpg|thumb|Grave of Robert Graves]]

=== Death ===
During the early 1970s Graves began to suffer from increasingly severe memory loss. By his 80th&nbsp;birthday in 1975, he had come to the end of his working life. He lived for another decade, in an increasingly dependent condition, until he died from heart failure on 7&nbsp;December 1985 at the age of 90&nbsp;years. His body was buried the next morning in the small churchyard on a hill at [[Deià]], at the site of a shrine that had once been sacred to [[the White Goddess]] of [[Pelion]].<ref name=ODNB/> His second wife, Beryl Graves, died on 27&nbsp;October 2003 and her body was interred in the same grave.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/beryl-graves-548996.html |title=Beryl Graves: Widow and editor of Robert Graves |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=29 October 2003 |type=obituary}}{{dead link|date=August 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>
