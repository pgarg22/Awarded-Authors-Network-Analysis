Nyberg is most famous for her songs written for the [[Walpurgis Night]] holiday, many of which are still sung and recorded today, including ''Vårvindar friska'' and ''Fruktmånglerskan med tapperhetsmedalj''.  For the majority of her literary career she belonged to the circle of writers that formed around the Romantic poet [[Per Daniel Amadeus Atterbom]] and regularly published her poetry in the group's journal: ''Poetisk kalender''.  She never aspired to the [[epic poetry]] that characterized many of her contemporaries' works, but instead focussed on writing shorter poems inspired by nature.
