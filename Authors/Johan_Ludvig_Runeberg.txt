'''Johan Ludvig Runeberg''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈjuːhɑn ˈlʉdːviɡ ˈrʉːnebærj|langfi}}; 5 February 1804 – 6 May 1877)<ref>{{cite web|title=Runeberg: a patriotic 19th-century rapper|url=https://finland.fi/arts-culture/runeberg-a-patriotic-rapper-of-the-19th-century/|publisher=[[Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Finland)]]|access-date=4 February 2018}}</ref> was a [[Finns|Finnish]] [[priest]], lyric and epic poet. Writing exclusively in his native Swedish, he is considered a [[national poet]] of Finland. He is the author of the lyrics to {{Lang|sv|Vårt land}} (''Our Land'', ''[[Maamme]]'' in Finnish) that became the unofficial Finnish [[national anthem]]. Runeberg was also involved in the modernization of the [[Virsikirja|Finnish Lutheran hymnal]] and produced many texts for the new edition.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://evl.fi/Virsikirja.nsf/745ff021168d4a8ac2256ff50049b96e/5b2e2f15e8d6c4d4c2256ffe004c5407?OpenDocument |title=Hannu Vapaavuori: Virsikirja ennen virsikirjaa |access-date=21 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320173348/http://evl.fi/Virsikirja.nsf/745ff021168d4a8ac2256ff50049b96e/5b2e2f15e8d6c4d4c2256ffe004c5407?OpenDocument |archive-date=20 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://finland.fi/life-society/the-finnish-national-anthem/|title= The Finnish National Anthem|publisher=  Finland Promotion Board

== Background ==
=== Childhood ===
Runeberg was born into a Swedish-speaking family in [[Jakobstad]], Finland, on the shores of the [[Gulf of Bothnia]]. His parents were [[sea captain]] Lorentz Ulrik Runeberg (1772–1828) and Anna Maria Malm (1782–1834).<ref name="merikapu"/><ref>[https://www.jakobstad.fi/kulttuuri-ja-vapaa-aika/pietarsaaren-kaupunginmuseo/ny-sida/runebergin-perhe/ Runebergin perhe – Pietarsaaren kaupunginmuseo] (in Finnish)</ref> Paternal grandfather Ludvig had moved to Finland from Sweden, and Anna Maria Malm was born to the [[merchant]] family from Jakobstad, which probably also had their roots in Sweden.<ref name="kansakunta">Helge Pohjolan-Pirhonen: ''Kansakunnan historia 3: kansakunta löytää itsensä'', p. 529–550. Helsinki: WSOY, 1973. ISBN 951-0-05774-6. (in Finnish)</ref>

As a child, Runeberg suffered from [[scrofula]], which led to glandular swelling. His physical development slowed down due to illness so that he did not learn to walk until he was three or four years old.<ref name="merikapu">[http://www.runeberg.net/fin/a_1_i.html Merikapteenin poika] (in Finnish)</ref> From his father, Johan inherited a manly and brisk character, and from his mother, he inherited sensitivity and artistic talent.<ref name="kansakunta"/>

=== Education ===
At the age of eight, Runeberg was sent to live with his uncle and attend school in [[Oulu]].  Runeberg studied in the city of [[Vaasa]] and later on at the [[Royal Academy of Turku|Imperial Academy of Turku]], where he befriended [[Johan Vilhelm Snellman]] and [[Zacharias Topelius]]. His studies concentrated mainly on the classical languages of Latin and Greek. He earned a Master of Philosophy during 1827. He served as a tutor (1822–1826), docent at the [[Imperial Alexander University]] (1830) and teacher at the Swedish-language Helsingfors Lyceum (1831–1836). From 1837 he lived in [[Porvoo]], where he served as professor of Latin literature in the [[Borgå gymnasium]]. Runeberg was the tutor of [[Carl Henrik Alopaeus]], who would later become the bishop of Porvoo and an educator of the deaf. Runeberg also supported [[Carl Oscar Malm|Carl Oscar Malm's]] school for the deaf in Porvoo (which Alopaeus taught at) as well as serving on its school board. Finnish [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] hostess [[Natalia Castrén]] (1830–1881) was a member of Runeberg's cultural circle.<ref>[http://www.kansallisbiografia.fi/kb/artikkeli/7399/ Suomen kansallisbiografia]  (National Biography of Finland)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://375humanistia.helsinki.fi/en/humanists/johan-ludvig-runeberg

==Poetry==
Many of his poems deal with life in rural Finland. The best known of these is {{Lang|sv|Bonden Paavo}}, (''Farmer Paavo'', {{Lang|fi|Saarijärven Paavo}} in Finnish), about a [[smallholding]] peasant farmer in the poor parish of [[Saarijärvi]] and his determination, [[sisu|''sisu'']] (guts) and unwavering faith in providence in the face of a harsh climate and years of bad harvests. Three times, a frosty night destroys his crops. Every time, he mixes double the amount of [[Phloem|bark]] into his [[bark bread]] to stave off [[starvation]] and works ever harder to dry off marsh into dryer land that would not be as exposed to the night frost. After the fourth year, Paavo finally gets a rich crop. As his wife exults, thanks God and tells Paavo to enjoy full bread made entirely out of grain, Paavo instructs his wife to mix bark into grain once more, because their neighbour's crop has been lost in a frost and he gives half of his crop to the needy neighbour.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.kansallisbiografia.fi/english/?id=2846|title=  Runeberg, Johan Ludvig (1804–1877)|publisher=Biografiakeskus|author= Matti Klinge, translated by Roderick Fletcher|access-date= 10 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://sydaby.eget.net/swe/jp_runeberg.htm|title=   Johan Ludvig Runeberg – National Poet of Finland|publisher= sydaby.eget.net|author=June Pelo |access-date= 15 April 2016}}</ref>

==Selected works==
Runeberg's main works included the idealist poem "{{Lang|sv|Älgskyttarna|italic=no}}" (Elk Hunters, 1832) and the epic {{Lang|sv|Kung Fjalar}} (King Fjalar, 1844). The heroic poem {{Lang|sv|Fänrik Ståls Sägner}} ([[The Tales of Ensign Stål]], {{Lang|fi|Vänrikki Stoolin tarinat}} in [[Finnish language|Finnish]]) written between 1848 and 1860 is considered the greatest Finnish [[epic poem]] outside the native [[Kalevala]] tradition and contains tales of the [[Finnish War]] of 1808–09 with [[Russia]]. In the war, [[Sweden]] ignominiously lost Finland, which became a [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Grand Duchy]] in the [[Russian Empire]]. The epic, which is composed episodically, emphasizes the common humanity of all sides in the conflict, while principally lauding the heroism of the Finns. The first poem {{Lang|sv|Vårt land}} (''Our Land'', ''[[Maamme]]'' in Finnish) became the [[Maamme|Finnish National Anthem]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.helsinki.fi/lehdet/uh/198a.html

Runeberg was selected as the main motif of the Finnish commemorative coin, the €10 [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Finland)#2004 coinage|Johan Ludvig Runeberg and Finnish Poetry commemorative coin]]. It was minted in 2004 celebrating the 200th anniversary of his birth. The obverse of the coin features a stylized portrait of Runeberg's face. The reverse features an 1831 font sample from the Swedish-language newspaper {{Lang|sv|Helsingfors Tidningar}}, since Runeberg wrote most of his work in Swedish.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.suomenrahapaja.fi/fin/j.l.-runeberg-ja-runous-10-bu/10720/dp|title= J.L.
