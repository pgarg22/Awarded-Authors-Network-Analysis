'''Sarah Daniels''' (born November 1956 in London [https://sites.google.com/site/strongvoiceproject/sarah-daniels]) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] dramatist.  She has been a prolific writer since her first professionally performed play, ''Ripen Our Darkness'', was given a production at the [[Royal Court Theatre|Royal Court]] in 1981.

==Career==
Daniels' playwriting career took off after she sent in a script to the Royal Court Theatre in London for reading and spent a year as the writer-in-residence of Sheffield University’s English department. Since the early 1980s her plays have appeared at other venues including the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]], the [[Battersea Arts Centre]], the [[Crucible Theatre|Crucible, Sheffield]] and [[Chicken Shed]]. She was the first living British playwright to have a play premiered at the National Theatre in London when ''Neaptide'' was performed there in 1986. She has also written episodes of the soap-operas  ''[[EastEnders]]'' and ''[[Holby City]]'', and the long-running BBC children's series ''[[Grange Hill]]''.

Daniels was involved in the "[[Video Nasties]]" censorship debate of the 1980s: in her 1983 play ''Masterpieces'', she mistakenly described the low-budget horror film ''[[Snuff (film)|Snuff]]'' (1976) as a real-life [[snuff film]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gilleman|first1=Luc|title=Drama and Pornography: Sarah Daniels's Masterpieces and Anthony Neilson's The Censor|journal=Journal of Dramatic Theory and Criticism|date=Fall 2010|volume=25|issue=1|pages=75–98|url=https://journals.ku.edu/jdtc/article/view/4102/3886|language=en|issn=0888-3203}}</ref>

Daniels is a popular and critically acclaimed writer and has had two collections of her plays published by [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]].

Daniels has also been a member of the board of directors for the [[Clean Break (theatre company)|Clean Break]] theatre company. Daniels' civil partner of many years, activist and schools inspector Claire Walton, died in 2009.

In June 2019, Daniels' dramatization of Jeremy Gavron's 2015 ''A Woman on the Edge of Time'', a memoir of his mother [[Hannah Gavron]], was broadcast as the ''[[15 Minute Drama]]'' on [[BBC Radio 4]].<ref name="BBC Drama">{{cite episode| title= A Woman on the Edge of Time| series= 15 Minute Drama | series-link= 15 Minute Drama | credits= Dramatized by: Sarah Daniels; Director:  Emma Harding | network= BBC| station= [[BBC Radio 4]]| url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m00061qp  | airdate= 10 June 2019| access-date= 14 June 2019 }}</ref>
