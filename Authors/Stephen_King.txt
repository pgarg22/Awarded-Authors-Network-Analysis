As a child, King apparently witnessed one of his friends being struck and killed by a train, though he has no memory of the event. His family told him that after leaving home to play with the boy, King returned speechlessly and seemingly in shock. Only later did the family learn of the friend's death. Some commentators have suggested that this event may have psychologically inspired some of King's darker works,<ref>{{cite book| last= Beahm| first= George| title= The Stephen King Story: A Literary Profile| publisher= Andrews and McMeel| year= 1991| isbn= 0836279891| url= https://archive.org/details/stephenkingstory00beah}}</ref> but King makes no mention of it in his memoir ''[[On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft|On Writing]]'' (2000). He related in detail his primary inspiration for writing horror fiction in his non-fiction ''[[Danse Macabre (book)|Danse Macabre]]'' (1981), in a chapter titled "An Annoying Autobiographical Pause". He compared his uncle's [[dowsing]] for water using the bough of an apple branch with the sudden realization of what he wanted to do for a living. That inspiration occurred while browsing through an attic with his elder brother, when King uncovered a paperback version of an [[H. P. Lovecraft]] collection of short stories he remembers as ''The Lurker in the Shadows'',<!-- "The Lurker in the Shadows" doesn't exist and King may mean "The Lurker at the Threshold", but as he says "Shadows" we qualify it by saying that's what he remembers it as.--> that had belonged to his father.

King attended Durham Elementary School and graduated from [[Lisbon Falls High School]] in [[Lisbon Falls, Maine]], in 1966.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Author |url=https://stephenking.com/the_author.html |website=StephenKing.com |access-date=September 9, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190816214429/https://stephenking.com/the_author.html |archive-date=August 16, 2019}}</ref> He displayed an early interest in horror as an avid reader of [[EC Comics|EC horror comics]], including ''[[Tales from the Crypt (comics)|Tales from the Crypt]]'', and he later paid tribute to the comics in his screenplay for ''[[Creepshow]]''. He began writing for fun while still in school, contributing articles to ''Dave's Rag'', the newspaper his brother published with a [[mimeograph machine]], and later began selling stories to his friends based on movies he had seen (he was forced to return the profits when discovered by teachers.) The first of his stories to be independently published was "[[I Was a Teenage Grave Robber]]", which was serialized over four issues (three published and one unpublished) of a [[fanzine]], ''Comics Review'', in 1965. That story was published the following year in a revised form as "In a Half-World of Terror" in another fanzine, ''Stories of Suspense'', edited by [[Marv Wolfman]].<ref>{{cite book| last=Wood | first=Rocky|title=Stephen King: Uncollected, Unpublished | publisher= Cemetery Dance Publications| location=Abingdon, Maryland |year=2006| page=199|isbn= 1-58767-130-1|display-authors=etal}}</ref> As a teen, King also won a [[Scholastic Art and Writing Awards|Scholastic Art and Writing Award]].<ref>{{cite press release| publisher= Scholastic Inc.| title= America's Most Creative Teens Named as National 2016 Scholastic Art & Writing Awards Recipients| url= http://mediaroom.scholastic.com/press-release/america-s-most-creative-teens-named-national-2016-scholastic-art-writing-awards-recipi| date= March 14, 2016| location= New York City| access-date= January 11, 2017| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170215014410/http://mediaroom.scholastic.com/press-release/america-s-most-creative-teens-named-national-2016-scholastic-art-writing-awards-recipi| archive-date= February 15, 2017| url-status= live}}</ref>

==Career==
===Beginnings===
[[File:Hampden Academy.jpg|thumb|In 1971, King worked as a teacher at [[Hampden Academy]]]]
King sold his first professional short story, "[[The Glass Floor]]", to ''Startling Mystery Stories'' in 1967.<ref name=OfficialBio/>

After graduating from the [[University of Maine]], King earned a certificate to teach high school but, unable to find a teaching post immediately, he initially supplemented his laboring wage by selling short stories to [[List of men's magazines|men's magazines]] such as ''[[Cavalier (magazine)|Cavalier]]''. Many of these early stories have been republished in the collection ''[[Night Shift (short story collection)|Night Shift]]''. The short story "The Raft" was published in ''Adam'', a men's magazine. After being arrested for stealing traffic cones (he was annoyed after one of the cones knocked his muffler loose), he was fined $250 for petty larceny but had no money to pay. However, a check then arrived for "The Raft" (then entitled "The Float"), and King cashed it to pay the fine.<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Klein|first=T.E.D.|date=June 1983|title=Cone fever . . .|url=https://archive.org/details/TwilightZoneJune83|journal=Rod Serling's the Twilight Zone Magazine|volume=3|issue=2|page=6}}</ref> In 1971, King was hired as a teacher at [[Hampden Academy]] in [[Hampden, Maine]]. He continued to contribute short stories to magazines and worked on ideas for novels.<ref name=OfficialBio/> During 1966–1970, he wrote a draft about his [[dystopian novel]] called ''[[The Long Walk]]''<ref>{{cite book|last=King|first=Stephen|title=Full Dark, No Stars|url=https://archive.org/details/fulldarknostars00king|url-access=registration|year=2010|chapter=Afterword|publisher=Scribner|isbn=9781439192566}}</ref> and the [[anti-war novel]] ''[[Sword in the Darkness]]'',<ref>{{cite book|last=Blue|first=Tyson|title=The Unseen King|publisher=Borgo Press|year=1989|isbn=1-55742-073-4}}</ref><ref>*{{cite book|last=Spignesi|first=Stephen|title=The Lost Work of Stephen King|publisher=Birch Lane Press|year=1998|isbn=1-55972-469-2}}</ref> but neither of the works was published at the time; only ''The Long Walk'' was later released in 1979.

===''Carrie'' and aftermath===
In 1973, King's novel ''[[Carrie (novel)|Carrie]]'' was accepted by publishing house [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]. ''Carrie'' was King's fourth novel,<ref>King, Stephen (2000) On Writing New York: Scribner. {{ISBN|978-1-43919-363-1}}, at p.77</ref> but it was the first to be published. It was written on a portable typewriter that belonged to his wife. The novel began as a short story intended for ''[[Cavalier (magazine)|Cavalier]]'' magazine, but King tossed the first three pages of his work in the garbage can.<ref>King (2000), p.78. Quote: "I did three single-spaced pages of a first draft, then crumpled them up in disgust and threw them away."</ref> Tabitha King fished the pages out of the garbage can and encouraged him to finish the story, saying that she would help him with the female perspective; he followed her advice and expanded it into a novel.<ref>King, Tabitha, Introduction to "Carrie" (Collector's Edition) Plume 1991</ref> King said, "I persisted because I was dry and had no better ideas… my considered opinion was that I had written the world's all-time loser."<ref name="brand">{{cite journal |last=King |first=Stephen |author-link=Stephen King |date=February 1980 |title=On Becoming a Brand Name |journal=Adelina Magazine |page=44}}</ref> According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''Carrie'' "is the story of Carrie White, a high-school student with latent—and then, as the novel progresses, developing—telekinetic powers.

===''The Dark Tower'' books===
{{Main|The Dark Tower (series)}}

In the late 1970s, King began what became a series of interconnected stories about a lone gunslinger, Roland, who pursues the "Man in Black" in an alternate-reality universe that is a cross between [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]] and the American [[Wild West]] as depicted by [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Sergio Leone]] in their [[spaghetti Western]]s. The first of these stories, ''[[The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger]]'', was initially published in five installments by ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction]]'' under the editorship of [[Edward L. Ferman]], from 1977 to 1981. ''The Gunslinger'' was continued as an eight-book epic series called ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]'', whose books King wrote and published infrequently over four decades.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

===<span id="Richard Bachman"></span>Pseudonyms===
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, King published a handful of short novels—''[[Rage (King novel)|Rage]]'' (1977), ''[[The Long Walk]]'' (1979), ''[[Roadwork]]'' (1981), ''[[The Running Man (King novel)|The Running Man]]'' (1982) and ''[[Thinner (novel)|Thinner]]'' (1984)—under the pseudonym [[Richard Bachman]]. The idea behind this was to test whether he could replicate his success again and to allay his fears that his popularity was an accident. An alternate explanation was that publishing standards at the time allowed only a single book a year.<ref name=kingbachman>{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenking.com/pages/FAQ/Stephen_King/whybachman.php |title=Stephen King FAQ: "Why did you write books as Richard Bachman?" |author=King, Stephen |access-date=December 13, 2006 |publisher=StephenKing.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115014750/http://www.stephenking.com/pages/FAQ/Stephen_King/whybachman.php |archive-date=November 15, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He picked up the name from the hard rock band [[Bachman-Turner Overdrive]], of which he is a fan.<ref>{{cite web |first=Steve |last=Newton |url=https://www.straight.com/article-193999/bto-founder-searched-stephen-king |title=Bachman-Turner Overdrive founder searched for Stephen King |website=Straight.com |date=January 13, 2009 |access-date=September 20, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118154751/http://www.straight.com/article-193999/bto-founder-searched-stephen-king |archive-date=January 18, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Richard Bachman was exposed as King's pseudonym by a persistent Washington, D.C. bookstore clerk, Steve Brown, who noticed similarities between the works and later located publisher's records at the [[Library of Congress]] that named King as the author of one of Bachman's novels.<ref>Brown, Steve.

In 2006, during a press conference in London, King declared that he had discovered another Bachman novel, titled ''[[Blaze (novel)|Blaze]]''. It was published on June 12, 2007. In fact, the original manuscript had been held at King's Alma mater, the University of Maine in [[Orono, Maine|Orono]], for many years and had been covered by numerous King experts.

King has used other pseudonyms. The short story "[[The Fifth Quarter (short story)|The Fifth Quarter]]" was published under the pseudonym John Swithen (the name of a character in the novel ''[[Carrie (novel)|Carrie]]''), by ''[[Cavalier (magazine)|Cavalier]]'' in April 1972.<ref>{{cite book|last=Beahm|first=George|title=Stephen King from A to Z: An Encyclopedia of His Life and Work|year=1998|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|isbn=978-0836269147|page=[https://archive.org/details/stephenkingfromt00beah/page/75 75]|url=https://archive.org/details/stephenkingfromt00beah/page/75}}</ref> The story was reprinted in King's collection ''[[Nightmares & Dreamscapes]]'' in 1993 under his own name.

The "children's book" ''[[Charlie the Choo-Choo (book)|Charlie the Choo-Choo: From the World of The Dark Tower]]'' was published in 2016 under the pseudonym Beryl Evans, who was portrayed by actress Allison Davies during a book signing at [[San Diego Comic-Con]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/07/22/charlie-choo-choo-stephen-king-dark-tower-comic-con|title='Charlie the Choo-Choo': 'The Dark Tower' fans seek Stephen King storybook that isn't real|date=July 22, 2016|access-date=August 11, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810013924/http://ew.com/article/2016/07/22/charlie-choo-choo-stephen-king-dark-tower-comic-con/|archive-date=August 10, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> and illustrated by Ned Dameron.

In 2019, he released the novel ''[[The Institute (novel)|The Institute]]''. In 2020, King released ''[[If It Bleeds]]'', a collection of four previously unpublished novellas.

==Collaborations==
===Writings===
King has written two novels with horror novelist [[Peter Straub]]: ''[[The Talisman (King and Straub novel)|The Talisman]]'' (1984) and a sequel, ''[[Black House (novel)|Black House]]'' (2001). King has indicated that he and Straub will likely write the third and concluding book in this series, the tale of Jack Sawyer, but has set no deadline for its completion.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

King produced an [[artist's book]] with designer [[Barbara Kruger]], ''[[My Pretty Pony]]'' (1989), published in a limited edition of 250 by the Library Fellows of the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]]. [[Alfred A. Knopf]] released it in a general trade edition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.moma.org/collection/object.php?object_id=11920 |title=The Collection &#124; Barbara Kruger.

''[[The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer: My Life at Rose Red]]'' (2001) was a paperback tie-in for the King-penned miniseries ''[[Rose Red (miniseries)|Rose Red]]'' (2002). Published under anonymous authorship, the book was written by Ridley Pearson. The novel is written in the form of a [[diary]] by Ellen Rimbauer, and annotated by the fictional professor of paranormal activity, Joyce Reardon. The novel also presents a fictional [[afterword]] by Ellen Rimbauer's grandson, Steven. Intended to be a promotional item rather than a stand-alone work, its popularity spawned a 2003 prequel television miniseries to ''Rose Red'', titled ''[[The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer (film)|The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer]]''. This spin-off is a rare occasion of another author being granted permission to write commercial work using characters and story elements invented by King. The novel tie-in idea was repeated on Stephen King's next project, the miniseries ''[[Kingdom Hospital]]''. [[Richard Dooling]], King's collaborator on ''Kingdom Hospital'' and writer of several episodes in the miniseries, published a fictional diary, ''The Journals of Eleanor Druse'', in 2004. Eleanor Druse is a key character in ''Kingdom Hospital'', much as Dr. Joyce Readon and Ellen Rimbauer are key characters in ''Rose Red.''{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

==Analysis==
===Writing style and approach===
[[File:Stephen King - 2011.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Stephen King in 2011]]
King's formula for learning to write well is: "Read and write four to six hours a day. If you cannot find the time for that, you can't expect to become a good writer." He sets out each day with a quota of 2000 words and will not stop writing until it is met. He also has a simple definition for talent in writing: "If you wrote something for which someone sent you a check, if you cashed the check and it didn't bounce, and if you then paid the light bill with the money, I consider you talented."<ref>''Everything You Need to Know About Writing Successfully—in Ten Minutes''</ref>

When asked why he writes, King responds: "The answer to that is fairly simple—there was nothing else I was made to do. I was made to write stories and I love to write stories. That's why I do it. I really can't imagine doing anything else and I can't imagine not doing what I do."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenking.com/pages/FAQ/Stephen_King/whywriter.php |title=Stephen King's official site |access-date=May 14, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509175239/http://www.stephenking.com/pages/FAQ/Stephen_King/whywriter.php |archive-date=May 9, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He is also often asked why he writes such terrifying stories and he answers with another question: "Why do you assume I have a choice?"<ref>{{Cite book| last =King | first =Stephen | title =Night Shift | publisher=Doubleday | year =1976 | location =xii | page =336 }}</ref> King usually begins the story creation process by imagining a "what if" scenario, such as what would happen if a [[Misery (novel)|writer is kidnapped by a sadistic nurse]] in Colorado.<ref name=JennaBlum6>Jenna Blum, 2013, ''The Modern Scholar'' published by Recorded Books, ''The Author at Work: The Art of Writing Fiction'', Disk 1, Track 11, {{ISBN|978-1-4703-8437-1}}</ref>

King often uses authors as characters, or includes mention of [[fictional book]]s in his stories, novellas and novels, such as Paul Sheldon, who is the main character in ''[[Misery (novel)|Misery]]'', adult [[Bill Denbrough]] in ''[[It (novel)|It]]'', Ben Mears in ''[['Salem's Lot]]'', and Jack Torrance in ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]''. He has extended this to breaking the [[fourth wall]] by including ''himself'' as a character in [[The Dark Tower (series)|''The Dark Tower'' series]] from ''[[The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla]]'' onwards. In September 2009 it was announced he would serve as a writer for ''[[Fangoria]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fangoria.com/home/news/1-latest-news/3978-stephen-king-writes-for-fangoria.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925002142/http://www.fangoria.com/home/news/1-latest-news/3978-stephen-king-writes-for-fangoria.html|url-status=dead|title=Stephen King writes for FANGORIA!|archive-date=September 25, 2009}}</ref>

===Influences===
King has called [[Richard Matheson]] "the author who influenced me most as a writer".<ref name="io9">{{cite web | url=http://io9.com/r-i-p-richard-matheson-author-of-i-am-legend-and-many-564036878 | title=R.I.P.

Other acknowledged influences include [[H. P. Lovecraft]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Houellebecq |first=Michel |title=H.P.

King's ''The Shining'' is immersed in [[Gothic literature|gothic]] influences, including "[[The Masque of the Red Death]]" by [[Edgar Allan Poe]] (which was directly influenced by the first gothic novel, [[Horace Walpole]]'s ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'').<ref name="Gothic influence"/> The Overlook Hotel acts as a replacement for the traditional gothic castle, and Jack Torrance is a tragic villain seeking redemption.<ref name="Gothic influence">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-30313775 "The Castle of Otranto: The creepy tale that launched gothic fiction"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180717063625/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-30313775 |date=July 17, 2018}}.

===Critical response===
Science fiction editors [[John Clute]] and [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Peter Nicholls]]<ref>Clute, John and Peter Nichols. ''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction''. New York: St. Martin's Griffin, 1993. {{ISBN|0-312-09618-6}}</ref> offer a largely favorable appraisal of King, noting his "pungent prose, sharp ear for dialogue, disarmingly laid-back, frank style, along with his passionately fierce denunciation of human stupidity and cruelty (especially to children) [all of which rank] him among the more distinguished 'popular' writers."

In his book ''The Philosophy of Horror'' (1990), [[Noël Carroll]] discusses King's work as an exemplar of modern horror fiction. Analyzing both the narrative structure of King's fiction and King's non-fiction ruminations on the art and craft of writing, Carroll writes that for King, "the horror story is always a contest between the normal and the abnormal such that the normal is reinstated and, therefore, affirmed."<ref>Carroll, Noël (1990) ''The Philosophy of Horror, or, Paradoxes of the Heart''. NY: Routledge, 0-415-90145-6</ref>

In his analysis of post–World War II horror fiction, ''The Modern Weird Tale'' (2001), critic [[S. T. Joshi]]<ref>Joshi, S.T, ''The Modern Weird Tale: A Critique of Horror Fiction'', McFarland & Company, 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-7864-0986-0}}</ref> devotes a chapter to King's work. Joshi argues that King's best-known works (his supernatural novels) are his worst, describing them as mostly bloated, illogical, maudlin and prone to ''[[deus ex machina]]'' endings. Despite these criticisms, Joshi argues that since ''[[Gerald's Game]]'' (1993), King has been tempering the worst of his writing faults, producing books that are leaner, more believable and generally better written.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

In 1996, King won an [[O. Henry Award]] for his short story "[[The Man in the Black Suit]]".<ref>[http://www.randomhouse.com/anchor/ohenry/winners/past.html#jump_k "Past Winners List"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110210064045/http://www.randomhouse.com/anchor/ohenry/winners/past.html#jump_k |date=February 10, 2011}}.

In his short story collection ''A Century of Great Suspense Stories'', editor [[Jeffery Deaver]] noted that King "singlehandedly made popular fiction grow up. While there were many good best-selling writers before him, King, more than anybody since John D. MacDonald, brought reality to genre novels. He has often remarked that ''[['Salem's Lot]]'' was "''[[Peyton Place (novel)|Peyton Place]]'' meets ''Dracula''. And so it was. The rich characterization, the careful and caring social eye, the interplay of story line and character development announced that writers could take worn themes such as vampirism and make them fresh again. Before King, many popular writers found their efforts to make their books serious blue-penciled by their editors. 'Stuff like that gets in the way of the story,' they were told. Well, it's stuff like that that has made King so popular, and helped free the popular name from the shackles of simple genre writing. He is a master of masters."<ref>{{cite book|title=A Century of Great Suspense Stories|editor-first=Jeffrey|editor-last=Deaver|page=[https://archive.org/details/centuryofgreatsu00deav/page/290 290]|publisher=Berkley Hardcover|date=2001|isbn=0-425-18192-8|url=https://archive.org/details/centuryofgreatsu00deav/page/290}}</ref>

In 2003, King was honored by the [[National Book Award]]s with a lifetime achievement award, the Medal of Distinguished Contribution to American Letters. Some in the literary community expressed disapproval of the award: [[Richard E. Snyder]], the former CEO of [[Simon & Schuster]], described King's work as "non-literature" and critic [[Harold Bloom]] denounced the choice:

<blockquote>The decision to give the National Book Foundation's annual award for "distinguished contribution" to Stephen King is extraordinary, another low in the shocking process of [[dumbing down]] our cultural life. I've described King in the past as a writer of [[penny dreadful]]s, but perhaps even that is too kind. He shares nothing with [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. What he is<!--not a mistake--> is an immensely inadequate writer on a sentence-by-sentence, paragraph-by-paragraph, book-by-book basis.<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2003/09/24/dumbing_down_american_readers/ | newspaper=[[Boston Globe]] | title=Dumbing down American readers | first=Harold | last=Bloom | date=September 24, 2003 | access-date=December 29, 2006 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060617015302/http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2003/09/24/dumbing_down_american_readers/ | archive-date=June 17, 2006 | url-status=live }}</ref></blockquote>

[[Orson Scott Card]] responded:

<blockquote>Let me assure you that King's work most definitely is literature, because it was written to be published and is read with admiration. What Snyder really means is that it is not the literature preferred by the academic-literary elite.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hatrack.com/osc/reviews/everything/2003-09-21.shtml |title=Yummi Bears, Lions, Boomtown, Mayer, and King – Uncle Orson Reviews Everything |publisher=Hatrack.com |access-date=September 12, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009183217/http://hatrack.com/osc/reviews/everything/2003-09-21.shtml |archive-date=October 9, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref></blockquote>

=== {{anchor|Car_accident_and_thoughts_of_retirement}}Car accident and aftermath ===
On June 19, 1999, at about 4:30&nbsp;p.m., King was walking on the shoulder of [[Maine State Route 5]], in [[Lovell, Maine]]. Driver Bryan Edwin Smith, distracted by an unrestrained dog moving in the back of his minivan, struck King, who landed in a depression in the ground about 14 feet (four meters) from the pavement of Route 5.<ref name="UKOnWriting" />{{rp|206}} Early reports at the time from Oxford County Sheriff deputy Matt Baker, claimed King was hit from behind and some witnesses said the driver was not speeding, reckless, or drinking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liljas-library.com/accident.html|title=King's accident|publisher=Lijia's Library|access-date=December 3, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050307182428/http://www.liljas-library.com/accident.html|archive-date=March 7, 2005}}</ref> However, Smith was later arrested and charged with [[Reckless driving#Maine|driving to endanger]] and aggravated assault. He pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of driving to endanger and was sentenced to six months in county jail (suspended), and had his driving license suspended for a year.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/oct/01/stephenking.fiction1 | title=The writer, the accident, and a lonely end | work=The Guardian | date=October 1, 2002 | access-date=March 11, 2020 | archive-date=October 18, 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201018165249/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/oct/01/stephenking.fiction1 | url-status=live }}</ref> In his book ''On Writing'', King states he was heading north, walking against the traffic. Shortly before the accident took place, a woman in a car, also northbound, passed King first and then the light-blue [[Dodge Ram van|Dodge van]]. The van was looping from one side of the road to the other, and the woman told her passenger she hoped "that guy in the van doesn't hit him."<ref name="UKOnWriting" />{{rp|206}}

King was conscious enough to give the deputy phone numbers to contact his family but was in considerable pain. He was transported to Northern Cumberland Hospital in Bridgton and then flown by air ambulance to Central Maine Medical Center (CMMC) in [[Lewiston, Maine|Lewiston]]. His injuries—a collapsed right lung, multiple fractures of his right leg, scalp laceration and a broken hip—kept him at CMMC until July 9. His leg bones were so shattered that doctors initially considered amputating his leg but stabilized the bones in the leg with an [[external fixator]].<ref>Rogak, Lisa.

King's lawyer and two others purchased Smith's van for $1,500, reportedly to prevent it from appearing on [[eBay]]. The van was later crushed at a junkyard, to King's disappointment, as he had fantasized about smashing it.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1124785 "Novelist Stephen King"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905100809/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1124785 |date=September 5, 2017}} ''Fresh Air''; [[NPR]] June 22, 2001</ref><ref>Dubner, Stephen J.
