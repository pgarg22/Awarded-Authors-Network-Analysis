'''Jon Silkin''' (2 December 1930 – 25 November 1997) was a British poet.

==Early life==
Jon Silkin was born in London, in a [[Jew]]ish immigrant family and named after Jon Forsyte in ''[[The Forsyte Saga]]'',<ref>H.C.G. Matthew, Brian Howard Harrison, (2004), ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: In Association with the British Academy'', (Oxford University Press)</ref> and attended [[Wycliffe College (Gloucestershire)|Wycliffe College]] and [[Dulwich College]]<ref>British Museum, Jenny Lewis, Arts Council of Great Britain, (1967), ''Poetry in the Making: Catalogue of an Exhibition of Poetry Manuscripts in the British Museum'', page 56, (Turret Books for the Arts Council of Great Britain and the British Museum)</ref> During the Second World War he was one of the children evacuated from London (in his case, to Wales); he remembered that he "roamed the countryside incessantly" while in Wales, collecting "fool's gold" and exploring old Roman mines.<ref>Jon Silkin, ''Contemporary Authors Autobiography Series'', Vol. 5. Gale., p. 250</ref> For a period of about six years in the 1950s, after [[National Service]], he supported himself by manual labour and other menial jobs. By 1956 he rented the top-floor flat at 10, Compayne Gardens, Hampstead, ({{Coord|51.5463| -0.1822}}), the house of [[Bernice Rubens]], who later won the Booker Prize, and her husband Rudolph Nassauer, also a published novelist, later. Silkin, in turn, sublet rooms to, among others, [[David Mercer (playwright)|David Mercer]], later a prolific TV and West End dramatist, and Malcolm Ross-Macdonald, then a diploma student at the Slade and later a novelist; his first novel, ''The Big Waves'' (Cape, 1962) is a ''[[roman à clef]]'' of life in that flat, in which Silkin features as Somes Arenstein. All three men lived by teaching English as a foreign language at the St Giles School of English in Oxford Street.

==Poetry==
He wrote a number of works on the [[war poetry]] of [[World War I]]. He was known also as editor of the literary magazine ''Stand'', which he founded in 1952, and which he continued to edit (with a hiatus from 1957 to 1960) until his death.

His first poetry collection, ''The Peaceable Kingdom'' was published in 1954. It contains his moving poem "Death of a Son":<ref>{{cite news|title=Obituary: Jon Silkin |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-jon-silkin-1286290.html |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219221145/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-jon-silkin-1286290.html |archivedate= 19 December 2013 |url-status=live |location=London |first=Rodney |last=Pybus |date=1 December 1997 }}</ref>  
<blockquote><poem>
...
He turned over on his side with his one year
Red as a wound
He turned over as if he could be sorry for this
And out of his eyes two great tears rolled, like stones, and he died.
</poem></blockquote>

The collection was followed by several more. ''The Lens Breakers'' was published by [[Sinclair Stevenson]] in 1992. He edited several anthologies and books of criticism, most notably on the poets of the [[First World War]]. He lectured and taught widely, both in [[UK|Britain]] and abroad (in among other places the United States, Israel, and Japan).

Silkin founded ''Stand'' in 1952 in London.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.people.vcu.edu/~dlatane/stand-maga/history.html|title = Stand Magazine -- A History}}</ref> He began an association with the [[University of Leeds]] in 1958, when he was awarded, as a mature student, a two-year [[Gregory Fellowship]], and where he read for a degree in English. ''Stand'' moved with him to Leeds, and the archives of ''Stand'' are now at the university.<ref name="Stand Magazine Archive">{{cite web|title=Stand Magazine Archive|url=https://library.leeds.ac.uk/special-collections-explore/20732|website=Special Collections|publisher=Leeds University Library|accessdate=16 March 2017}}</ref> In 1965, Northeast Arts offered funding, and he moved to [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], where he lived until his death.

He was working with [[Cargo Press]] on his collection ''[[Testament Without Breath]]'' at the time of his death in November 1997.
