'''Denys Corbet''' (22 May 1826 – 21 April 1909) was a [[Guernsey]] poet, [[Naïve art|naïve]] painter, and [[schoolmaster]], the second son of Pierre Corbet, a seafarer, and Susanne (''[[née]]'' de Beaucamp). He was born at La Turquie, Vale, Guernsey, [[Channel Islands]] and is thought to have lost his parents in childhood.

=="Last Poet"==
Corbet described himself as the ''Le Draïn Rimeux'' (The Last Poet). He is best known for his poems, notably the epic ''L'Touar de Guernesy'', a picaresque tour of the parishes of Guernsey, ''Les Feuilles de la Fôret'' (The Leaves of the Forest, 1871), and ''Les Chànts du drain rimeux, ou Pièces de poësie originale en guernesiais et en français'' (Songs of the Last Rhymer, or Original Pieces of Poetry in Dgèrnésiais and French, 1884).<ref>British Library Main Catalogue [http://explore.bl.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/search.do?vid=BLVU1 Retrieved 7 August 2016.]</ref> As editor of the French-language newspaper ''Le Bailliage'', he also wrote [[prose]] columns in Dgèrnésiais under the pen name Badlagoule (Chatterbox).{{cn|date=August 2016}}

The French scholar R. J. Lebarbenchon, in a 1988 tribute, described Corbet as "philanthrope, pacifiste, partisan du progrès, apôtre de l'instruction publique, il se classe aussi parmi les modernes et a foi en l'avenir" (philanthropist, pacifist, supporter of progress, apostle of public education, he ranks also among the moderns and has faith in the future).<ref name="ODNB"/>

==Centenary==
Today Denys Corbet is largely remembered as a naïve painter of rural life. The Canadian artist [[Christian Corbet]] is a collateral descendant.{{cn|date=August 2016}} A special exhibition to mark the centenary of Corbet's death was held on 30–31 May 2009 at the Forest Douzaine, Forest, Guernsey, where a portrait of Denys Corbet painted by Christian Corbet was unveiled by Hazel Cotgrove, a great-granddaughter of Denys's.{{cn|date=August 2016}}
