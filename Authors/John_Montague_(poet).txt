'''John Montague''' (28 February 1929 − 10 December 2016) was an Irish poet. Born in America, he was raised in Ireland. He published a number of volumes of poetry, two collections of short stories and two volumes of memoir. He was one of the best known Irish contemporary poets. In 1998 he became the first occupant of the Ireland Chair of Poetry<ref name="Ireland Chair Of Poetry John Montague">{{cite web|url=http://irelandchairofpoetry.org/j_montague.php |title=Poet Laureate |access-date=18 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131005020923/http://irelandchairofpoetry.org/j_montague.php |archive-date= 5 October 2013 }}</ref> (essentially Ireland's [[poet laureate]]). In 2010, he was made a [[Chevalier de la Legion d'honneur]], France's highest civil award.<ref name= final />

==Early life==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}
John Montague was born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]], on 28 February 1929. His father, James Montague, an Ulster [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]], from [[County Tyrone]], had gone to America in 1925 to join his brother John. Both were sons of John Montague, who had been a [[justice of the peace|JP]], combining his legal duties with being a schoolmaster, farmer, postmaster and director of several firms.

John continued as postmaster but James became involved in the turbulent [[Irish Republican]] scene in the years after 1916, particularly complicated in areas like Fermanagh and Tyrone, on the borders of the [[Partition of Ireland|newly divided island]].

Molly (Carney) Montague joined her husband James in America in 1928, with their two elder sons. John was born on Bushwick Avenue at St. Catherine's Hospital, and spent his earliest years playing with his brothers in the streets of Brooklyn, putting nickels on the trolley lines, playing on a tenement roof, seeing early [[Mickey Mouse]] movies.

===Return to Garvaghey===
Although the uncle John ran a [[speakeasy]], where he employed his brother James, life in New York was difficult during the [[Great Depression]], so the three boys were shipped back to Ireland in 1933, the two eldest to their maternal grandmother's house in Fintona, County Tyrone, where they had been born, but John was sent to his father's ancestral home at [[Garvaghey]], then maintained by two spinster aunts, Brigid and Freda, who welcomed the boy of four.

From New York to a farm on the edge of the Clogher Valley in County Tyrone was a significant step backwards in time. John did all the usual farming chores. He became a normal Ulster farm child, though haunted by the disparity between what the house in Garvaghey had been, in the days of his grandfather and namesake, and the reduced present. Montague reminisced about the gardens of his Ulster home in his poem, "Paths".<ref>{{cite news| first= Billy| last= Mills| url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/apr/03/poster-poems-pathways |title= Poster poems: Pathways| work= [[The Guardian]]| date= 3 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| first= John| last= Montague| url= http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poem/29521 |title= Paths by John Montague| publisher= Poetry Foundation| website= PoetryFoundation.org}}</ref>

John went first to Garvaghey School and then to Glencull, three miles away, where he was coached by a young and ardent master. Scholarships brought him to [[St. Patrick's Grammar School, Armagh|St. Patrick's College, Armagh]], the junior diocesan seminary and the place where his [[Jesuit]] uncle, Thomas Montague, had gone.

===Education===
John Montague studied at [[University College Dublin]] in 1946. He found an extraordinary contrast between the Ulster of the war years and post-war Dublin, where the atmosphere was introverted and melancholy. Stirred by the example of other student poets (including [[Thomas Kinsella]]) he began to publish his first poems in ''[[The Dublin Magazine]]'', ''[[Envoy, A Review of Literature and Art|Envoy]]'', and ''[[The Bell (magazine)|The Bell]]'', edited by [[Peadar O'Donnell]]. But the atmosphere in Dublin was still constrained and Montague left for [[Yale]] on a [[Fulbright Fellowship]] in 1953.

John had already met [[Saul Bellow]] at the Salzburg Seminar in American Studies and now he worked with [[Robert Penn Warren]] as well as auditing the classes of several Yale critics, like Rene Wellek and W. K. Wimsatt. He extended his sense of contemporary American literature, attending Indiana Summer School of Letters where he heard Richard Wilbur, Leslie Fiedler, and [[John Crowe Ransom]], who like the Irish poet [[Austin Clarke (poet)|Austin Clarke]], encouraged Montague, finding him a job at the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]] in 1954 and 1955.

From Iowa to [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], a year of graduate school convinced Montague that he should return to Ireland. He sailed back to France that summer, to marry his first wife, Madeleine,<ref>[http://www.independent.ie/unsorted/features/the-full-montague-509016.html The full Montague]. Independent.ie (24 June 2001). Retrieved on 2015-04-28.</ref> whom he had met in Iowa, where she was also on a Fulbright; they settled in Herbert Street, Dublin, a few doors down from [[Brendan Behan]]. Working by day at the [[Bord Fáilte|Irish Tourist Office]], Montague at last gathered his first book of poems, ''Poisoned Lands'' (1961).

That year he also moved to Paris, to a small studio a block away from [[Samuel Beckett]], with whom he slowly became on good drinking terms.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120308112546/http://ireland.poetryinternationalweb.org/piw_cms/cms/cms_module/index.php?obj_id=8073 John Montague]. Ireland – Poetry International Web</ref> There, he also met another neighbour, the French poet [[Claude Esteban]], with whom he became friends – Montague later translated into English and published some of his poems.<ref>Poems by [[Claude Esteban]] translated by John Montague: ''A Smile between the stones'', Agenda Editions (Mayfield, UK), 2005, and ''On the Last Heath'', in ''Poetry'' (Chicago, Oct.-Nov. 2000), pp. 78-83.</ref>

A regular rhythm of publication saw his first book of stories, ''Death of a Chieftain'' (1964) after which the musical group [[The Chieftains]] were named, his second book of poems, ''A Chosen Light'' (1967), ''Tides'' (1970), the latter both also published by Swallow in the U.S.

All during the 1960s, Montague continued to work on his long poem, ''[[The Rough Field]]'', a task that coincided with the outbreak of the [[Civil Rights]] Movement in Northern Ireland.

''A Patriotic Suite'' appeared in 1966, ''Hymn to the New Omagh Road'' and ''The Bread God'' in 1968, and ''A New Siege'', dedicated to [[Bernadette Devlin McAliskey|Bernadette Devlin]] which he read outside Armagh Jail in 1970. In 1972, the long poem was finally published by Dolmen/Oxford and Montague returned to Ireland, to live and teach in [[University College Cork]], at the request of his friend, the composer [[Seán Ó Riada]].{{fact|date=June 2021}} His students at UCC during the 1970s included a number of writers, sometimes collectively referred to as "the Cork poets", that included [[Gregory O'Donoghue]], [[Seán Dunne (poet)|Sean Dunne]], [[Thomas McCarthy (poet)|Thomas McCarthy]], [[William Wall (writer)|William Wall]], [[Maurice Riordan]], [[Gerry Murphy (poet)|Gerry Murphy]], [[Greg Delanty]] and [[Theo Dorgan]].<ref name="examiner2020">{{cite web | url = https://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/arid-30996571.html| publisher = Irish Examiner | website = irishexaminer.com | title = New book looks at Cork’s golden generation of poets | last = Sheridan| first = Colette | date = 20 April 2020 | accessdate = 20 June 2021 | quote = Theo Dorgan, Gerry Murphy, Greg Delanty, Maurice Riordan the late Gregory O'Donoghue [..] All were students of John Montague and Sean Lucey at the university [UCC] }}</ref> In a birthday tribute for his 80th, [[William Wall (writer)|William Wall]] wrote: "It would be impossible to overestimate his influence on the young writers who went to UCC ([[University College Cork]]) at that time."<ref>[http://homepage.eircom.net/~williamwall/williamwall/Ice_Moon_Blog/Entries/2009/2/28_Happy_Birthday_John_Montague.html Happy Birthday John Montague] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611043812/http://homepage.eircom.net/~williamwall/williamwall/Ice_Moon_Blog/Entries/2009/2/28_Happy_Birthday_John_Montague.html |date=11 June 2011 }}.

==Later years: 1974–2016==
Settled in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] with his second wife, Evelyn Robson,<ref name="ricorso.net">[http://www.ricorso.net/rx/az-data/authors/m/Montague_J/life.htm John Montague: Life, &c]. Ricorso.net. Retrieved on 28 April 2015.</ref> Montague published an anthology, ''[[Faber Book of Irish Verse|The Faber Book of Irish Verse]]'' (1974) with a book of lyrics, ''A Slow Dance'' (1975). Recognition was now beginning to come, with the award of the Irish American Cultural Institute in 1976, the first Marten Toonder Award in 1977, and in 1978, the Alice Hunt Bartlett Award for ''The Great Cloak'', "the best book of poetry in two years" according to the Poetry Society of Great Britain. A Guggenheim in 1979 and 1980 enabled Montague to complete his ''Selected Poems'' (1982) and his second long poem, ''The Dead Kingdom'' (1984) both co-published by Dolmen (Ireland), Oxford (England), Wake Forest University Press (US) and Exile Editions (Canada).

In 1987, Montague was awarded an honorary doctor of letters by the ''State University of New York'' at Buffalo. Governor [[Mario M. Cuomo]] presented Montague a citation in 1987 "for his outstanding literary achievements and his contributions to the people of New York." Montague served as distinguished writer-in-residence for the [[New York State Writers Institute]] during each spring semester, teaching workshops in fiction and poetry and a class in the English Department of the [[University of Albany]].{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

In 1995, Montague and his second wife, Evelyn, separated, and he formed a partnership with American student Elizabeth Wassell (later to be author of ''The Honey Plain'' (1997)).<ref name="ricorso.net"/> He has 2 daughters with Evelyn, Sibyl and Oonagh.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/books/montagues-still-on-fire-26524604.html|title= Montague's still on fire| website= Independent.ie |date=29 March 2009|access-date=28 April 2015}}</ref>

In 1998, Montague was named the first Irish professor of poetry, a three-year appointment to be divided among The Queen's University in Belfast, Trinity College Dublin, and University College Dublin.  He held this title from 1998 to 2001, when he was succeeded by Nuala Ní Dhomhnaill. In 2008, he published ''A Ball of Fire'', a collection of all his fiction including the short novella ''The Lost Notebook''.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.libertiespress.com/cartage.html?main_page=product_book_info&cpath=13&products_id=54&zenid=pqdbv4khe9dj8hgssr4bbutgl5| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110713204309/http://www.libertiespress.com/cartage.html?main_page=product_book_info&cpath=13&products_id=54&zenid=pqdbv4khe9dj8hgssr4bbutgl5 |title= A Ball of Fire Collected Stories| website= libertiespress.com| archive-date= July 13, 2011}}</ref>

==Style==
Montague's poems chart boyhood, schooldays, love and relationships. Family and personal history and Ireland's history are also prominent themes in his poetry.

Montague is noted for his vowel harmonies, his use of [[assonance]] and echo, and his handling of the line and line break. Montague believed that a poem appears with its own rhythm and that rhythm and line lengths should be based on living speech.
