He is regarded as the pioneer of modern [[Albanian literature]] and one of the most influential [[Albanian culture|Albanian cultural]] icons of the 19th century.<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of the Literary Cultures of East-Central Europe: Junctures and Disjunctures in the 19th and 20th Centuries|last=Elsie|first=Robert|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|year=2004|isbn=9789027234537|pages=291|chapter=The Hybrid Soil of the Balkans: A Topography of Albanian Literature|volume=2|author-link=Robert Elsie|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5pAwqsSyTlsC&pg=PA291}}</ref> 
 
Naim and his brothers [[Abdyl Frashëri|Abdyl]] and [[Sami Frashëri|Sami]] were born and raised in the village of [[Frashër]] at the southern slopes of the [[Tomorr Mountain]]s. He became acquainted with numerous cultures and languages such as [[Arabic]], [[Ancient Greek|Ancient]] and [[Modern Greek language|Modern Greek]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] and [[Persian language|Persian]].<ref name="Languages">{{cite web |author1=Robert Elsie |author-link1=Robert Elsie |title=Die Drei Frashëri-Brüder |url=http://www.elsie.de/pdf/articles/A2001DreiFrash.pdf|website=elsie.de|pages=23|language=de|quote=Hier lernte er Alt- und Neugriechisch, Französisch und Italienisch.

Upon the death of his father, he and his family settled to [[Ioannina]] where he earned initial inspiration for his future poetries written in the [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] and [[Romanticism|romantic]] style. After he suffered a severe lung infection, due to his congenital [[tuberculosis]], in [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], he joined his brother [[Abdyl Frashëri|Abdyl]] in the fight for national freedom and consciousness of the Albanian people during the [[Albanian Renaissance]] in which he later became the most distinguished representative of that period.<ref name="Elsie2005-70"/>

Frashëri's masterpieces explored themes such as [[freedom]], humanity, unity, [[Toleration|tolerance]] and [[revolution]]. His extant works include twenty two works composed of fifteen works written in [[Albanian language|Albanian]] as well as four in Turkish, two in Greek and one in Persian, accessible to an audience beyond Albania. He is the most representative writer of [[sufi poetry]] in Albanian, being under the influence of his uncle [[Dalip Frashëri]], he tried to mingle [[sufism]] with [[western philosophy]] in his poetical ideals.<ref name=":Osmani">{{Cite web|url=http://www.iemed.org/observatori/arees-danalisi/arxius-adjunts/qm-17-originals/qm17_Osmani.pdf|title=God in the Eagles' Country: The Bektashi Order|last=Osmani|first=Edlira|website=iemed.org|publisher=Quaderns de la Mediterrània 17, 2012|pages=113}}</ref><ref name="Norris">{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RGmzir-ITtUC&q=dalip+frasheri&pg=PA180|author=H.T.Norris|pages=76|title=Islam in the Balkans: Religion and Society Between Europe and the Arab World|location=Columbia, S.C|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|year=1993|isbn=9780872499775|oclc=28067651}}</ref> He had an extraordinarily profound impact on the Albanian literature and society during the 20th century most notably on [[Asdreni]], [[Gjergj Fishta]] and [[Lasgush Poradeci]], among many others.<ref name="Asdreni">{{cite book |author1=Robert Elsie |author-link1=Robert Elsie |title=Albanian Literature: A Short History |date=29 July 2005 |publisher=I.B.Tauris, 2005 |isbn=9781845110314 |pages=100–103 |language=en}}</ref><ref name="Lasgush Poradeci">{{cite book |author1=Robert Elsie |author-link1=Robert Elsie |title=Historical Dictionary of Albania |year=2010 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield, 2010 |isbn=9780810861886 |pages=362–363 |language=en}}</ref>
 
''[[Ti Shqipëri, më jep nder, më jep emrin Shqipëtar]]'', a memorable line in his poem ''O malet e Shqipërisë'', has been designated as the [[national motto]] of Albania. It speaks to unity, freedom and it embodies in its words a sense of pride towards country and people.

== Life ==
 
=== Family ===
[[File:Banesa e Vëllazërisë Frashëri 03.jpg|300px|thumb|The family house of Naim Frashëri in [[Frashër]].]]
Naim Frashëri was born on 25 May 1846 into a wealthy [[Albanians|Albanian]] family of religious belief affiliated with the [[Bektashi Order|Bektashi]] [[tariqa]] of Islam, in the village of [[Frashër]] in what was then part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and now [[Albania]]. He, [[Abdyl Frashëri|Abdyl]] and [[Sami Frashëri|Sami]] were one of eight children of Halid Frashëri (1797–1859), a landowner and military commander and Emine (1814-1861).<ref name="Gawrych13"/> Halid belonged to the Dakollari branch of the Frashëri family. They were descendants of Ajaz Bey from [[Gramsh, Elbasan|Gramsh]] who in 1650-60 was given the command of Frashër. Ajaz Bey's grandfather, Hamza Bey had lost his lands in [[Tomorrica]] in 1570 when he rebeled and was exiled but the family's fortunes changed with the rise of [[Köprülü Mehmed Pasha]] who intervened on their behalf and they were pardoned.{{sfn|Frashëri|2014|p=385}} Emine came from the family of [[Iljaz Bej Mirahori]] from the region around [[Korçë County|Korçë]] that traced its [[ancestry]] back to the 15th century.<ref name="Elsie2005-70"/>

=== Education ===

His religion paved the way for much of his future accomplishments.

In the [[Tekke of Frashër]], he received lessons in all the common subjects of his time especially in [[language]]s such as [[Arabic]], [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] and [[Persian language|Persian]]. As a member of a family which gave him a strong [[Bektashi]] upbringing, he spent a part of his time in a Bektashi tekke. After the death of their parents, the family moved to [[Ioannina]] in 1865. The eldest brother, Abdyl (b. 1839), became the family head at the age of 22 and started working as a merchant. That year Naim and Sami enrolled in the [[Zosimaia School|Zosimaia secondary school]].<ref name="Gawrych1326">{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|pp=13, 26.}}</ref> The education there provided Naim with the basics of a classical education along Western lines.<ref name="Gawrych13">{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=wPOtzk-unJgC&pg=PA13 13].}}</ref> Apart from languages he learned in the Zosiamaia (Ancient and Modern Greek, French and Italian), Naim took private lessons in Persian, Turkish and Arabic from two important local Bektashi.<ref name="Qosja2000">{{cite book|author=Qosja, Rexhep |title=Porosia e madhe: monografi mbi krijimtarinë e Naim Frashërit [The Great Instruction]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qM47MwAACAAJ|year=2000|pages=34–42|isbn=9789992713372}}</ref>

After he finished his studies in 1870, Frashëri worked for a few months at the press office in Istanbul (1870) but was forced to return to his home village because of tuberculosis. The climate of Frashër helped Naim and soon he started work in the Ottoman bureaucracy as a clerk in Berat and later in Saranda (1872–1877).<ref name="Shuteriqi1971">{{cite book|author=Dhimitër S.

===Politics===
In 1879, along with his brother Sami and 25 other Albanians, Naim Frashëri founded and was a member of the [[Society for the Publication of Albanian Writings]] in Istanbul that promoted Albanian language publications.<ref name="Skendi119">{{harvnb|Skendi|1967|p=119.}}</ref><ref name="Gawrych59">{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=59.}}</ref> Ottoman authorities forbid writing in Albanian in 1885 that resulted in publications being published abroad and Frashëri used his initials '''N.H.F.''' to bypass those restrictions for his works. Later on, Albanian schools were established im 1887 in Southeeastern Albania.<ref name="Skendi128">{{harvnb|Skendi|1967|p=128.}}</ref>

An Albanian magazine, ''[[Drita (magazine)|Drita]]'', appeared in 1884 under the editorship of [[Petro Poga]] and later [[Pandeli Sotiri]] with Naim Frashëri being a behind the scenes editor as it was not allowed by Ottoman authorities to write in Albanian at that time.<ref name="Skendi146"/><ref name="Gawrych88"/> Naim Frashëri and other Albanian writers like his brother Sami Frashëri would write using pseudonyms in Poga's publication.<ref name="Skendi146">{{harvnb|Skendi|1967|p=146.}}</ref><ref name="Gawrych88"/> Due to a lack of education material Naim Frashëri, his brother Sami and several other Albanians wrote textbooks in the Albanian language during the late 1880s for the [[Mësonjëtorja|Albanian school in Korçë]].<ref name="Gawrych88">{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=88.}}</ref> In a letter to [[Faik Konitza]] in 1887, Frashëri expressed sentiments regarding the precarious state of the Ottoman Empire that the best outcome for Albanians was a future annexation of all of Albania by [[Austria-Hungary]].<ref name="Skendi268">{{harvnb|Skendi|1967|p=268.}}</ref>

In 1900 Naim Frashëri died in Istanbul. During the 1950s the Turkish government allowed for his remains to be sent and reburied in Albania.<ref name="Gawrych200">{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=200.}}</ref>

"Oh mountains of Albania 
and you, oh trees so lofty,
Broad plains with all your flowers, 
day and night I contemplate you,
You highlands so exquisite, 
and you streams and rivers sparkling,
Oh peaks and promontories, 
and you slopes, cliffs, verdant forests,
Of the herds and flocks 
I'll sing out which you hold 
and which you nourish.
Oh you blessed, sacred places, 
you inspire and delight me!
[[Ti Shqipëri, më jep nder, më jep emrin Shqipëtar|You, Albania, give me honour, 
and you name me as Albanian]],
And my heart you have replenished 
both with ardour and desire.
Albania! Oh my mother! 
Though in exile I am longing,
My heart has ne'er forgotten 
all the love you've given to me ..."

With its literary stature and the broad range both stylistic and thematic of its content, Frashëri significantly contributed to the development of the modern [[Albanian language|Albanian]] [[literary language]]. The importance of his works lies less in his creative expression than in the [[social]] and [[political]] intention of his poetry and faith. His works were noted by the desire to the emergence of an [[independent Albania]]n unity that overcomes denominational and territorial differences, and by an optimistic belief in civilization and the political, [[economic]] and [[cultural]] rise of the [[Albanian people]].
 
In his poem ''Bagëti e Bujqësi'', Frashëri idyllically describes the natural and cultural beauty of Albania and the modest life of its people where nothing infringes on mystical euphoria and all conflicts find reconciliation and fascination.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Arshi Pipa |title=Letërsia Shqipe: Perspektiva Shoqërore Volume 3 of Trilogjia Albanika |year=2013 |isbn=9789928409096 |pages=97–100 |language=sq}}</ref>

[[File:Nail Frashëri statue.jpg|right|upright|thumb|A [[King Michael I Park|bust]] of Naim Frashëri in [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]].]]

The prime representative of [[Romanticism]] in [[Albanian literature]], Frashëri is considered by many to be the most distinguished [[Albanian poets|Albanian poet]] of the [[Albanian Renaissance]] whose [[poetry]] continued to have a tremendous influence on the literature and society of the [[Albanian people]] in the 20th century.<ref>{{Citation|last=Elsie|first=Robert|title=Albanian literature: a short history |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ox3Wx1Nl_2MC&pg=PA100|access-date=18 January 2011|year=2005|publisher=I.B.

After his death, Frashëri became a great source of inspiration and a guiding light for the Albanian writers and intellectuals of the 20th century amongst them [[Asdreni]], [[Gjergj Fishta]], [[Mitrush Kuteli]] and [[Lasgush Poradeci]].<ref name="Asdreni"/><ref name="Lasgush Poradeci"/> His great work such as ''Bagëti e Bujqësi'', ''Gjuha Jonë'' and ''Feja'' promoted national unity, consciousness, and tolerance in the breasts of his countrymen an enthusiasm for the culture and history of their ancestors.
