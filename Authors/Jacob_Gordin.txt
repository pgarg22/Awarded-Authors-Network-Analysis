'''Jacob Michailovitch Gordin''' ([[Yiddish]]: יעקװ מיכײַלאָװיטש גאָרדין; May 1, 1853 – June 11, 1909) was a [[Russia]]n-born [[United States|American]] playwright active in the early years of [[Yiddish theater]]. He is known for introducing [[Realism (theatre)|realism]] and [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalism]] into Yiddish theater.

''The Cambridge History of English and American Literature'' characterizes him as "the acknowledged reformer of the Yiddish stage."<ref name=Cambridge>"[http://www.bartleby.com/228/0852.html Jacob Gordin]." ''[[The Cambridge History of English and American Literature]]: An encyclopedia in eighteen volumes''. New&nbsp;York: G.&nbsp;P. Putnam's Sons, 1907-1921. Volume 18: Later National Literature, Part III. Chapter 31, Non-English Writings I (German, French, Yiddish), section 52. Online version by ''Bartleby.com''.</ref> At the time of his rise, professional Yiddish theater was still dominated by the spirit of the early (1886–1888) plays of its founder, [[Abraham Goldfaden]], which derived in no small measure from [[Purim]] plays, often spectacles more than dramas; Goldfaden's later works were generally [[operetta]]s on more serious subjects, perhaps edifying, but not naturalistic. Again quoting the ''Cambridge History'', after his 1892 arrival in [[New York City]], "Gordin took the Yiddish drama in America from the realm of the preposterous and put a living soul into it," bringing it up to the level of "realistic melodrama."<ref name=Cambridge/>

==Life and career==
Gordin was born in [[Myrhorod]], Ukraine, [[Russian Empire]], and received a liberal though irregular education at home.  He was recognized as a reformer and a  Russian writer. He had also been a farmer, a journalist, a shipyard worker in [[Odessa]], and, reportedly, an actor.

He migrated to [[New York City|New York]] in July 1891, and tried to make a living writing for Russian-language newspapers and the Yiddish [[socialism|socialist]] ''Arbayter Tsaytung'' (the precursor to the ''Forverts'', ''[[The Forward]]''), but his acquaintanceship with the noted Jewish actors [[Jacob Pavlovich Adler|Jacob Adler]] and [[Sigmund Mogulesko]] prompted him to try his hand at play-writing.

His first play, ''Siberia'', was based on a true story about a man sent [[Katorga|as a prisoner to Siberia]] and who escaped, lived out a normal life for many years, and was then exiled again. Although initially it met a rocky reception (as did his second play, ''Two Worlds''), it was a critical success. His third play ''The Pogrom in Russia'' was produced in January 1892 by the actor [[Boris Thomashefsky]]. In June 1892, Gordin signed a contract with [[Jacob Pavlovich Adler]], and later that year, for Adler and his troupe, he wrote ''Der yidisher kenig lir'' (''[[The Jewish King Lear]]''), loosely adapted from Shakespeare<ref>Kaplan, Beth (2007). ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/Finding_the_Jewish_Shakespeare.html?id=5VUOAAAAYAAJ Finding The Jewish Shakespeare: The Life and Legacy of Jacob Gordin]''. Syracuse: Syracuse University Press. {{ISBN|9780815608844}}. p. 57.</ref>  and the Russian writer [[Ivan Turgenev]]'s ''King Lear of the Steppes'', and set in 19th century Russia. It laid the foundation of his career as a Yiddish playwright. The play drew a new audience of Russian-Jewish intellectuals to the Yiddish theater and constituted a defining moment in Adler's career as well as Gordin's. It is widely seen as ushering in the first "Golden Age" of Yiddish theater in New York.<ref>[[Lulla Rosenfeld|Rosenfeld, Lulla]] (June 12, 1977). "The Yiddish Idol." ''[[New York Times Magazine]]''. p. 42.</ref>

To some extent he had to compromise his [[modernism|modernist]] vision with the theatrical conventions of the time. As in the plays of Goldfaden, [[Moses Horowitz|Moses Horowitz (Hurvitz)]], and [[Joseph Lateiner]], dancing and songs unrelated to the plot still occupied a prominent part in the play, but Gordin's plots were naturalistic and the characters were living persons. Under the influence of his plays, Jewish actors began to regard their profession as one which calls for study and an earnest attitude.

Gordin is noted more for bringing naturalism and realism into the Yiddish theater than as an intrinsically great dramatist. Again quoting the ''Cambridge History'', "With all the realism of his situations, with all the genuineness of his characters, he was rather a producer of plays for a particular theatrical troupe than a writer of drama. That his comic characters generally stand in organic relation to the play is one of his chief merits. Of his many pieces (about 70 or 80) only a score or so have been published."<ref name=Cambridge/> They single out as some of his best ''Mirele Efros'', ''Got, Mentsh un Tayvl'' (''God, Man, and Devil'', based on [[Goethe]]'s ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]''), and ''Der Umbakanter'' (''The Unknown'').
