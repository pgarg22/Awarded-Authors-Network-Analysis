'''Adrian Henri''' (10 April 1932 – 20 December 2000) was a British [[poet]] and painter<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slick.org/deathwatch/mailarchive/msg00151.html|agency=[[Reuters]]|title=Poet Adrian Henri dies in his beloved Liverpool|date=21 December 2000|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416095932/http://slick.org/deathwatch/mailarchive/msg00151.html|archive-date=16 April 2008}}</ref> best remembered as the founder of poetry-rock group the Liverpool Scene and as one of three poets in the best-selling anthology ''[[The Mersey Sound (book)|The Mersey Sound]]'', along with [[Brian Patten]] and [[Roger McGough]]. The trio of [[Liverpool poets]] came to prominence in that city's [[Beat music|Merseybeat]] ''[[zeitgeist]]'' of the 1960s and 1970s. He was described by [[Edward Lucie-Smith]] in ''[[British Poetry since 1945]]'' as the "theoretician" of the three. His characterisation of popular culture in verse helped to widen the audience for poetry among 1960s British youth. He was influenced by the French [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] school of poetry and [[surrealist]] art.

==Life and career==

Adrian Henri's grandfather was a seaman from [[Mauritius]] who settled in [[Birkenhead]], [[Cheshire]], where Henri was born. In 1938, at the age of six, he moved to [[Rhyl]].<ref name=wade>{{cite book|title=Gladsongs and Gatherings: Poetry and Its Social Context in Liverpool Since the 1960s|editor-first=Stephen|editor-last=Wade|chapter=Adrian Henri: Singer of Meat and Flowers|pages=73–81|first=David|last=Bateman|publisher=[[Liverpool University Press]]|date=1 March 2001|isbn=0-85323-727-1}}.</ref> He studied art at [[Newcastle University|Newcastle]] and for a short time taught art at [[Preston Catholic College]] before going on to lecture in art at both [[Manchester]] and Liverpool Colleges of Art. He was closely associated with other artists of the area and the era including the Pop artist [[Neville Weston]] and the conceptual artist [[Keith Arnatt]]. In 1972 he won a major prize for his painting ''Meat Painting II – In Memoriam Rene Magritte'' in the [[John Moores (merchant)|John Moores]] competition. He was president of the Merseyside Arts Association and Liverpool Academy of the Arts in the 1970s and was an honorary professor of the city's [[Liverpool John Moores University|John Moores University]]. Henri had a 10-year relationship with [[Carol Ann Duffy]], who later became [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom]]. The pair met when she was 16 and lived together until 1982.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stylist.co.uk/people/interviews-and-profiles/interview-carol-ann-duffy |title=INTERVIEW: CAROL-ANN DUFFY|work=Stylist|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007040121/http://www.stylist.co.uk/people/interviews-and-profiles/interview-carol-ann-duffy |archive-date=7 October 2011}}</ref> Henri married once, to Joyce; the couple later separated. He had no children. For the last 15 years of his life his partner was Catherine Marcangeli.<ref name = mike>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/dec/22/guardianobituaries.books|work=[[The Guardian]]|title=Obituary: Adrian Henri|first=Mike|last=Evans|date=22 December 2000}}</ref> His career spanned everything from artist and poet to teacher, rock-and-roll performer, playwright and librettist. He could name among his friends [[John Lennon]], [[George Melly]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Willy Russell]], [[John Willett]] and [[Paul McCartney]]. Unlike McGough and Patten, Henri turned his back on the trendier London scene, and chose to remain in Liverpool, saying there was nowhere he loved better.

His numerous publications include ''[[The Mersey Sound (book)|The Mersey Sound]]'' (Penguin, 1967), with McGough and Patten, a best-selling poetry anthology that brought all three of them to wider attention, ''Collected Poems, 1967–85'' ([[Allison & Busby]], 1986), ''Wish You Were Here'' ([[Jonathan Cape]], 1990) and ''Not Fade Away'' ([[Bloodaxe Books]], 1994). 

He was the leading light of a band, the Liverpool Scene, which released four LPs of poetry and music. Earlier, in 1955, he played washboard in the King's College, Newcastle, Skiffle Group. He was a firm believer in live poetry reading, and read his poetry at many and varied venues as well as holding poetry workshops at schools and colleges. One of his last major poetry readings was at the launch of ''The Argotist'' magazine in 1996.

In 1986 Henri became the first President of the National Acrylic Painters' Association, a post he held until 1991, after which he became its first Fellow and Patron until his death in 2000.

He died in Liverpool, aged 68, having never properly recovered from a stroke that he had suffered two years previously. The night before his death, [[Liverpool City Council]] conferred on him the Freedom of the City in recognition of his contribution to Liverpool's cultural scene.<ref name=mike/> He also received an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Liverpool]].

He described his early philosophy as "If you think you can do it and you want to do it—then do it."

In 2012 ''Adrian Henri: Total Artist'' was released. ''Total Artist'' concentrates on Henri's work from the 1960s and 1970s, as well as capturing some of the excitement and dynamics of the art scene in Britain during this time. Henri was at the centre of a distinctive yet highly connected counter-culture, providing an opportunity to consider his embrace of total art as a template for interdisciplinary art practice. Published by Occasional Papers, the Exhibition Research Centre, Liverpool John Moores University and Université Paris Diderot.

==The Liverpool Scene==
The Liverpool Scene was a poetry band, formed around 1967, which included Adrian Henri, [[Andy Roberts (musician)|Andy Roberts]], Mike Evans, [[Mike Hart (poet)|Mike Hart]] (ex [[Liverpool Roadrunners]]),<ref name=wade/> [[Percy Jones (musician)|Percy Jones]] and Brian Dodson. Four LPs were issued with Henri's poetry heavily featured. The first one was produced by Liverpool DJ [[John Peel]], who was then working on the pirate radio station [[Wonderful Radio London|Radio London]]. Despite his support, the album achieved little success: the following three were equally unsuccessful. Public performances by the band included a (financially unsuccessful) 1969 tour<ref name=wade/> when they opened for [[Led Zeppelin]]. Henri was described in performance as "bouncing thunderously and at risk to audience and fellow performers, the stage vibrating out of rhythm beneath him." The Liverpool Scene disbanded in April 1970.<ref name=wade/>

The albums were:
*''The Incredible New Liverpool Scene''
*''The Amazing Adventures Of''
*''Bread on the Night''
*''St. Adrian & Co., Broadway and 3rd''
*''Heirloon'' (rarities and outtakes)
There were at least three "best of" albums and two non-LP singles, "Love Is"/"The Woo-Woo" and "Son, Son"/"Baby".
