'''Keith Castellain Douglas''' (24 January 1920 – 9 June 1944) was an [[England|English]] [[poet]] and soldier noted for his war poetry during the [[World War II|Second World War]] and his wry memoir of the [[Western Desert campaign]], ''[[Alamein to Zem Zem]]''.<ref name=ZemZem>{{cite book|last=Douglas|first=Keith|title=Alamein to Zem Zem|year=2009|publisher=Faber & Faber|isbn=978-0571252961}}</ref> He was [[killed in action]] during the invasion of [[Normandy]].

==Poetry==
Douglas described his poetic style as "extrospective";<ref name=TK>{{cite journal|last=Kendall|first=Tim|title='I see men as trees suffering': The Vision of Keith Douglas|journal=Proceedings of the British Academy|year=2003|volume=117|pages=431–432|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> that is, he focused on external impressions rather than inner emotions. The result is a poetry which, according to his detractors, can be callous in the midst of war's atrocities. For others, Douglas's work is powerful and unsettling because its exact descriptions eschew egotism and shift the burden of emotion from the poet to the reader. His best poetry is generally considered to rank alongside the 20th century's finest soldier-poetry.

In his poem, "Desert Flowers" (1943), Douglas mentions World War I poet [[Isaac Rosenberg]], claiming that he is only repeating what Rosenberg has already written.<ref>{{cite book|last=Douglas|first=Keith|title=The Complete Poems|year=1987|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0192812319|page=102|editor=Desmond Graham|quote=Rosenberg I only repeat what you were saying.}}</ref>

==Early life==
Douglas was born in [[Tunbridge Wells]], [[Kent]], the son of Capt. Keith Sholto Douglas, [[Military Cross|MC]] (retired) and Marie Josephine Castellain.<ref name=DNB>{{cite web|last=Stallworthy|first=Jon|title=Douglas, Keith Castellain (1920–1944)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/37368|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004}}</ref> His mother became unwell and collapsed in 1924 of [[encephalitis lethargica]], never to fully recover. By 1926, the chicken farm business set up by his father had failed. Douglas was sent to [[Edgeborough School]], a [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory school]] in [[Guildford]], the same year. The family became increasingly poor, and his father had to leave home in early 1928 to seek better employment in [[Wales]]. The persistent ill-health of Marie led to the collapse of the marriage of his parents by the end of that year, and his father remarried in 1930. Douglas was deeply hurt by his father not communicating with him after 1928, and when Capt. Douglas did write at last in 1938, Keith did not agree to meet him. In one of his letters written in 1940 Douglas looked back on his childhood: "I lived alone during the most fluid and formative years of my life, and during that time I lived on my imagination, which was so powerful as to persuade me that the things I imagined would come true."

===Education===
Marie Douglas faced extreme financial distress, so much so that only the generosity of the Edgeborough headmaster Mr. James permitted Douglas to attend school in 1930–1931, his last year there. Douglas sat in 1931 for the entrance examination to [[Christ's Hospital]], where education was free and there was monetary assistance to cover all other costs. He was accepted, and joined Christ's Hospital, near [[Horsham]], in September 1931, studying there till 1938. It was at this school that his considerable poetic talent and artistic ability were recognised. So was his cavalier attitude to authority and property, which nearly led to expulsion in 1935 over a purloined training rifle. In surprising contrast, he excelled as a member of the school's [[Officers Training Corps]], particularly enjoying drill, although he was philosophically opposed to militarism.

===University===
After his bruising brush with authority in 1935, Douglas settled down to a less troubled and more productive period at school, during which he excelled both at studies and games, and at the end of which he won an [[Exhibition (scholarship)|open exhibition]] to [[Merton College, Oxford]], in 1938 to read [[History]] and [[English language|English]].<ref name="MCreg">{{cite book|editor1-last=Levens|editor1-first=R.G.C.|title=Merton College Register 1900-1964|date=1964|publisher=Basil Blackwell|location=Oxford|page=291}}</ref> The [[First World War]]-veteran and well-known poet [[Edmund Blunden]] was his tutor at Merton,<ref name=DNB /> and regarded his poetic talent highly. Blunden sent his poems to [[T. S. Eliot]], the doyen of English poetry, who found Douglas's verses 'impressive'. Douglas became the editor of ''[[Cherwell (newspaper)|Cherwell]]'', and one of the poets anthologised in the collection ''Eight Oxford Poets'' (1941),<ref name=8OP>{{cite book|title=Eight Oxford Poets|year=1941|publisher=George Routledge & Sons|location=London |editor=Michael Mayer |editor2=Sidney Keyes}}</ref> although by the time that volume appeared he was already in the army. He does not seem to have been acquainted with somewhat junior but contemporary Oxford poets such as [[Sidney Keyes]], [[Drummond Allison]], [[John Heath-Stubbs]] and [[Philip Larkin]], who would make names for themselves. At Oxford, he was good friends with [[J. C. Hall (poet)|J. C. Hall]]<ref>{{cite book |last1=Noel-Tod |first1=Jeremy |last2=Hamilton |first2=Ian |year=2013 |title=The Oxford Companion to Modern Poetry in English |location=[[Oxford]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=9780199640256 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XZKcAQAAQBAJ |page=239}}</ref> who became his literary executor.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.faber.co.uk/author/jc-hall/ |title=J.C. Hall - Authors - Faber & Faber |website=www.faber.co.uk}}</ref>

At Oxford, Douglas entered a relationship with a sophisticated [[China|Chinese]] student named Yingcheng, or Betty Sze, the daughter of a diplomat. Her own sentiments towards him were less intense, and she refused to marry him. Yingcheng remained the unrequited love of Douglas's life and the source of his best romantic verse, despite his involvements with other women later, most notably Milena Guiterrez Penya.

==Military service==

Within days of the declaration of war he reported to an army recruiting centre with the intention of joining a [[cavalry]] regiment, but like many others keen to serve he had to wait, and it was not until July 1940 that he started his training. After attending the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]], he was commissioned on 1 February 1941 into the [[2nd Derbyshire Yeomanry]]<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=3508230222 |supp=y| date=18 February 1941|page=1067}}</ref> at [[Ripon]]. He was posted to the Middle East in July 1941 and transferred to the [[Nottinghamshire (Sherwood Rangers) Yeomanry]]. Posted initially at [[Cairo]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], he found himself stuck at headquarters twenty miles behind [[El Alamein]] as a camouflage officer as the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] began. At dawn on 24 October 1942, the Regiment advanced, and suffered numerous casualties from enemy anti-tank guns. Chafing at inactivity, Douglas took off against orders on 27 October,<ref name=DNB /> drove to the Regimental HQ in a truck, and reported to the C.O., Colonel [[Edward Kellett (Conservative politician)|E. O. Kellett]], lying that he had been instructed to go to the front (luckily this escapade did not land him in serious trouble; in a reprise of 1935, Douglas got off with an apology). Desperately needing officer replacements, the Colonel posted him to A Squadron, and gave him the opportunity to take part as a fighting tanker in the Eighth Army's victorious sweep through [[North African Campaign|North Africa]], vividly recounted in his memoir ''Alamein to Zem Zem'', which was illustrated with his own drawings.

===Death===
Captain Douglas returned from North Africa to England in December 1943 and took part in the [[Normandy landings|D-Day]] invasion of [[Normandy]] on 6 June 1944. On 9 June Douglas's armoured unit was pinned down on high ground overlooking [[Tilly-sur-Seulles]]. Concerned by the lack of progress, Douglas dismounted his tank to undertake a personal reconnaissance during which he was killed by a German [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Render, Tootal |first1=David, Stuart |title=Tank Action:An Armoured Troop Commanders War 1944-5 |date=2016 |publisher=Hachette UK |location=United Kingdom |isbn=978-1-474-60329-4 |edition=First |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K_vcCgAAQBAJ&q=St+Pierre+death+of+keith+douglas&pg=PT70 |access-date=18 December 2019}}</ref> The [[Military chaplain|regimental chaplain]] Captain Leslie Skinner buried him by a hedge, close to where he had died on "forward slopes point 102".<ref>{{cite book|last=Beevor|first=Antony|title=D-Day: The Battle for Normandy|year=2009|publisher=Penguin UK|isbn=978-0141959269|page=238}}</ref> Shortly after the war his remains were reburied at [[Tilly-sur-Seulles War Cemetery]] (14&nbsp;km south of Bayeux) in plot 1, row E, grave number 2.<ref name="grave">{{cite web|title=DOUGLAS, KEITH CASTELLAIN|url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2218647/DOUGLAS,%20KEITH%20CASTELLAIN|work=Commonwealth War Graves Commission website|publisher=Commonwealth War Graves Commission|access-date=17 April 2013}}</ref>
