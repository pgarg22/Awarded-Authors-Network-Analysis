He is considered to be one of the finest [[Renaissance]] playwrights and prose writers of [[Croatian literature]].

== Life ==
Born into a large and well to do family (with 6 sisters and 5 brothers<ref name="Jugoslovenski književni leksikon">{{cite book |author= Živojin Boškov |editor = Živan Milisavac |date=1971 |title=Jugoslovenski književni leksikon |trans-title=Yugoslav Literary Lexicon |publisher=[[Matica srpska]] |language=sh |location= [[Novi Sad]] ([[Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina|SAP Vojvodina]], [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|SR Serbia]]) |page=106 }}</ref>) in Dubrovnik, Držić was trained and ordained as a priest &mdash; a calling very unsuitable for his rebel temperament. Marin's uncle was another famous author [[Džore Držić]]. Ordained in 1526, Držić was sent in 1538 to [[Siena]] in [[Tuscany]] to study the Church [[Canon Law]], where his academic results were average.<ref name="Jugoslovenski književni leksikon"/> Thanks to his extroverted and warm personality, he is said to have captured the hearts of his fellow students and professors, and was elected to the position of [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] of the [[University]]. Losing interest in his studies, Marin returned to the [[Dubrovnik Republic]] in 1543.

Here he became an acquaintance of Austrian adventurer Christoph Rogendorf, then at odds with [[Vienna]] court. After a brief sojourn in [[Vienna]], Držić came back to his native city. Other vagabond exploits followed: a connection with a group of Dubrovnik outlaws, a journey to [[Constantinople]] and a brief trip to [[Venice]]. After a career as an interpreter, scrivener and church musician, he even became a conspirator. Convinced that Dubrovnik was governed by a small circle of elitist aristocracy bent to tyranny, he tried to persuade in five letters (four of which survive) the powerful [[Medici]] family in [[Florence]] to help him overthrow the government in his home town; they did not respond.<ref name="Jugoslovenski književni leksikon"/> Marin died suddenly in [[Venice]] on 2 May 1567.<ref name="Jugoslovenski književni leksikon"/> He was buried in the Church of St. John and Paul.

== Works ==
Držić's works cover many fields: [[lyric poetry]], [[pastoral]]s, political letters and [[pamphlets]], and [[comedy|comedies]]. While his pastorals (''Tirena'', ''Venera i Adon'' and ''Plakir'') are still highly regarded as masterful examples of the genre, the pastoral has, as artistic form, virtually vanished from the scene.

However, his comedies are among the best in European [[Renaissance]] literature. As with other great comedy writers like [[Lope de Vega]], [[Ben Jonson]] or [[Molière]], Držić's comedies are full of exuberant life and vitality, celebrating love, liberty and sincerity and mocking avarice, egoism and petty tyrants &mdash; both in the family and in the state. His best-known comedies include:
* ''Pomet'' (1548 or 1553) - some historiographers argue that ''Pomet'' is indeed Marin's oldest play, his debut, while others disagree.  The fact that it's lost makes it harder to classify it.
* ''Novela od Stanca'' (1550)
* ''[[Dundo Maroje]]'' (1551 or 1556) - arguably Marin's most famous play. It was also played in some international theatres.
* ''Skup'' (1554) - thematically similar to [[Plautus]]' ''[[Aulularia]]'' and [[Molière|Molière's]] ''[[The Miser]]''

The gallery of young lovers, misers, cuckolds, adventurers, senile tyrants, painted with the gusto of buoyant idiom that exemplifies richness of Croatian in the Renaissance period has remained the pillar of [[South Slav|South Slavic]] high comedy theatre ever since.
