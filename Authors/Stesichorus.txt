'''Stesichorus''' ({{IPAc-en|s|t|ə|ˈ|s|ɪ|k|ə|r|ə|s}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Στησίχορος}}, ''Stēsichoros''; c. 630 – 555 BC) was a Greek [[Greek lyric|lyric poet]]. He is best known for telling epic stories in lyric metres<ref>Charles Segal, "Archaic Choral Lyric" in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and B. Knox (eds.), Cambridge University Press (1985), page 186</ref> but he is also famous for some ancient traditions about his life, such as his opposition to the tyrant [[Phalaris]], and the blindness he is said to have incurred and cured by composing verses first insulting and then flattering to [[Helen of Troy]].

He was ranked among the [[nine lyric poets]] esteemed by the scholars of [[Hellenistic]] [[Alexandria]] and yet his work attracted relatively little interest among ancient commentators,<ref>D.A. Campbell (ed.), ''Greek Lyric'' Vol 3, Loeb Classical Library (1991) page 5</ref> so that remarkably few fragments of his poetry now survive. As one scholar observed in 1967: "Time has dealt more harshly with Stesichorus than with any other major lyric poet."<ref>David Campbell, ''Greek Lyric Poetry'', Bristol Classical Press (1982), page 253, reprinted from 1967 Macmillan edition</ref> Recent discoveries, recorded on Egyptian papyrus (notably and controversially, the [[Lille Stesichorus]]),<ref name="autogenerated7">P.J. Parsons, "The Lille Stesichorus", ''Zeitschreift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik'' Vol. 26 (1977), pages 7–36</ref> have led to some improvements in our understanding of his work, confirming his role as a link between [[Homer]]'s epic narrative and the lyric narrative of poets like [[Pindar]].<ref>Charles Segal, "Archaic Choral Lyric" in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and B. Knox (eds.), Cambridge University Press (1985), page 187; Steve Reece, "Homeric Influence in Stesichorus' Nostoi," ''Bulletin of the American Society of Papyrologists'' 25 (1988) 1-8.</ref>

The following description of the birthplace of the monster [[Geryon]], preserved as a quote by the geographer [[Strabo]],<ref>Strabo 3.2.11 = Stesichorus S7 = ''PMG'' 184.</ref> is characteristic of the "descriptive fulness" of his style:<ref>Charles Segal, "Archaic Choral Lyric" in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and B. Knox (eds.), Cambridge University Press (1985), page 188</ref>

A nineteenth century translation imaginatively fills in the gaps while communicating something of the richness of the language:

Stesichorus exercised an important influence on the representation of myth in 6th century art<ref>C.M. Bowra, ''Greek Lyric Poetry'', Oxford University Press (1961), pages 119–26</ref> and on the development of Athenian dramatic poetry.<ref>Richard Jebb, ''Bacchylides: The poems and fragments''

==Biography==
Stesichorus was born in Metauros (modern [[Gioia Tauro]]) in [[Calabria]], Southern Italy<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/565868/Stesichorus|title=Stesichorus|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://writershistory.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=820&Itemid=32|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714184346/http://writershistory.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=820&Itemid=32|url-status=dead|archive-date=2014-07-14|title=Writers History - Stesichorus|work=writershistory.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calabria.nu/magna.htm#Like|title=Ooops!

A History of Ancient Greek Literature|work=forgottenbooks.com}}</ref> c. 630 BC and died in Katane (modern [[Catania]]) in [[Sicily]] in 555 BC. Some say that he came from Himera in Sicily, but that was due to him moving from Metauros to Himera later in life. When exiled from [[Pallantium]] in [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Arcadia]] he came to Katane ([[Catania]]) and when he died there was buried in front of the gate which is called Stesichorean after him. In date he was later than the lyric poet [[Alcman]], since he was born in the 37th [[Olympiad]] (632/28 BC). He died in the 56th Olympiad (556/2 BC). He had a brother Mamertinus who was an expert in geometry and a second brother Helianax, a law-giver. He was a lyric poet. His poems are in the Doric dialect and in 26 books. They say that he was blinded for writing abuse of [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] and recovered his sight after writing an encomium of Helen, the Palinode, as the result of a dream. He was called Stesichorus because he was the first to establish (''stesai'') a chorus of singers to the [[cithara]]; his name was originally Tisias.

===Chronology===
The specific dates given by the ''Suda'' for Stesichorus have been dismissed by one modern scholar as "specious precision"<ref>M.L.West, 'Stesichorus', ''The Classical Quarterly, New Series'' Vol.21, No.2 (Nov. 1971) page 302</ref> {{em dash}} its dates for the ''[[floruit]]'' of [[Alcman]] (the 27th Olympiad), the life of Stesichorus (37th–56th Olympiads) and the birth of [[Simonides]] (the 56th Olympiad) virtually lay these three poets end-to-end, a coincidence that seems to underscore a convenient division between old and new styles of poetry.<ref>Charles Segal, 'Archaic Choral Lyric' – P. Easterling and E. Kenney (eds), ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature'', Cambridge University Press (1985), page 186-7</ref> Nevertheless, the ''Suda'''s dates "fit reasonably well" with other indications of Stesichorus's life-span {{em dash}} for example, they are consistent with a claim elsewhere in ''Suda'' that the poet [[Sappho]] was his contemporary, along with [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]] and [[Pittacus]], and also with the claim, attested by other sources, that [[Phalaris]] was his contemporary.<ref>Campbell in ''Loeb'' page 3</ref> [[Aristotle]] quoted a speech the poet is supposed to have made to the people of Himera warning them against the tyrannical ambitions of Phalaris.<ref>Aristotle ''Rhet.'' 2.20.1393b, cited by David A.Campbell, ''Greek Lyric III: Stesichorus, Ibycus, Simonides and Others'', Loeb Classical Library (1991), page 39</ref> The Byzantine grammarian [[Tzetzes]] also listed him as a contemporary of the tyrant and yet made him a contemporary of the philosopher [[Pythagoras]] as well.<ref>Tzetzes ''Vit.Hes.'' 18, cited by David A.Campbell, ''Greek Lyric III: Stesichorus, Ibycus, Simonides and Others'', Loeb Classical Library (1991), page 33</ref> According to [[Lucian]], the poet lived to 85 years of age.<ref>Lucian ''Macr.'', cited by David A.Campbell, ''Greek Lyric III: Stesichorus, Ibycus, Simonides and Others'', Loeb Classical Library (1991), page 33</ref> [[Saint Jerome|Hieronymus]] declared that his poems became sweeter and more swan-like as he approached death,<ref>Hieronymus ''Epistles'' 52.3, David A.Campbell, ''Greek Lyric III: Stesichorus, Ibycus, Simonides and Others'', Loeb Classical Library (1991), page 33</ref> and [[Cicero]] knew of a bronzed statue representing him as a bent old man holding a book.<ref>Cicero ''Verr.'' 2.2.86, cited by David A.Campbell, ''Greek Lyric III: Stesichorus, Ibycus, Simonides and Others'', Loeb Classical Library (1991), page 45</ref> [[Eusebius]] dated his ''floruit'' in Olympiad 42.2 (611/10 BC) and his death in Olympiad 55.1 (560/59 BC).<ref>Eusebius ''Chron.'', cited by David A.Campbell, ''Greek Lyric III: Stesichorus, Ibycus, Simonides and Others'', Loeb Classical Library (1991), page 31</ref>

===Family===
The ''Suda'''s claim that [[Hesiod]] was the father of Stesichorus can be dismissed as "fantasy"<ref>Cambell, ''Loeb'' page 35</ref> yet it is also mentioned by [[Tzetzes]]<ref>Tzetzes ''Vit.Hes.'' 18, cited by Campbell, ''Loeb'' page 35</ref> and the Hesiodic [[scholiast]] Proclus<ref>Proclus ''Hes. Op.'' 271a, cited by Campbell in ''Loeb'' page 35</ref> (one of them however named the mother of Stesichorus via Hesiod as Ctimene and the other as Clymene). According to another tradition known to [[Cicero]], Stesichorus was the ''grandson'' of Hesiod<ref>Cicero ''De Rep. 2.20'', cited by Campbell in ''Loeb'' page 37</ref> yet even this verges on anachronism since Hesiod was composing verses around 700 BC.<ref>Jasper Griffin, "Greek Myth and Hesiod", J. Boardman, J. Griffin and O. Murray (eds), ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'', Oxford University Press (1986), page 88</ref> Stesichorus might be regarded as Hesiod's literary "heir" (his treatment of Helen in the Palinode, for example, may have owed much to Hesiod's ''[[Catalogue of Women]]'')<ref>Charles Segal, "Archaic Choral Lyric" in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Greek Literature'', Cambridge University Press (1985), page 191</ref> and maybe this was the source of confusion about a family relationship.<ref>Richard Lattimore translation, "Hesiod" Intro. pp. 5, The University of Michigan Press, 1959</ref> According to [[Stephanus of Byzantium]]<ref>Stephanus of Byzantium [[s.v.]] {{lang|grc|Μάταυρος}}, cited by Campbell in ''Loeb'' page 35</ref> and the philosopher [[Plato]]<ref>Plato ''Phaedrus'' 244a, cited by Campbell in ''Loeb'' page 37</ref> the poet's father was named Euphemus, but an inscription on a [[herm]] from [[Tivoli, Italy|Tivoli]] listed him as Euclides.<ref>[[Inscriptiones Graecae]] xiv 1213, cited by Campbell in ''Loeb'' page 37</ref> The poet's mathematically inclined brother was named Mamertinus by the ''Suda'' but a scholiast in a commentary on [[Euclid]] named him Mamercus.<ref>Proclus in ''Euclid Prolog. 2'', cited by Campbell in ''Loeb'' page 37</ref>

===Background===
Stesichorus's lyrical treatment of epic themes was well-suited to a western Greek audience, owing to the popularity of hero-cults in southern Italy and [[Magna Graeca]], as for example the cult of [[Philoctetes]] at [[Sybaris]], [[Diomedes]] at [[Thurii]] and the [[Atreidae]] at [[Taranto|Tarentum]].<ref>Richard Jebb, ''Bacchylides: The poems and fragments'' Cambridge Uni Press (1905), page 32</ref> It was also a sympathetic environment for his most famous poem, The Palinode, composed in praise of Helen, an important cult figure in the Doric diaspora.<ref name="autogenerated191">Charles Segal, 'Archaic Choral Lyric' – P. Easterling and E. Kenney (eds), ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature'', Cambridge University Press (1985), page 191</ref> On the other hand, the western Greeks were not very different from their eastern counterparts and his poetry cannot be regarded exclusively as a product of the Greek West .<ref>G.O.Hutchinson, ''Greek Lyric Poetry: a commentary on selected larger pieces'', Oxford University Press (2001), page 113</ref> His poetry reveals both [[Dorians|Doric]] and [[Ionians|Ionian]] influences and this is consistent with the ''Suda'''a claim that his birthplace was either Metauria or Himera, both of which were founded by colonists of mixed Ionian/Doric descent.<ref>Charles Segal, 'Archaic Choral Lyric' – P. Easterling and E. Kenney (eds), ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature'', Cambridge University Press (1985), page 186</ref> On the other hand, a Doric/Ionian flavour was fashionable among later poets {{em dash}} it is found in the 'choral' lyrics of the Ionian poets [[Simonides]] and [[Bacchylides]] {{em dash}} and it might have been fashionable even in Stesichorus's own day.<ref>G.O.Hutchinson, ''Greek Lyric Poetry: a commentary on selected larger pieces'', Oxford University press (2001), page 115</ref> His poetry included a description of the river Himera<ref>Vibius Sequester, ''de fluminibus fontibus'' etc, cited by Campbell in ''Loeb'' page 181</ref> as well as praise for the town named after it,<ref>Himerius ''Orationes'' 27.27, cited by Campbell in ''Loeb'' page 181</ref> and his poem ''[[Geryoneis]]'' included a description of Pallantium in Arcadia.<ref>Pausanias 8.3.2, cited by Campbell in ''Loeb'' page 89</ref> His possible exile from Arcadia is attributed by one modern scholar to rivalry between [[Tegea]] and [[Sparta]].<ref>W.G.Forrest, ''A History of Sparta 950–192 BC'', page 76, cited by Campbell in ''Loeb'' page 28, note 4</ref> Traditional accounts indicate that he was politically active in Magna Graeca. Aristotle mentions two public speeches by Stesichorus: one to the people of Himera, warning them against Phalaris, and another to the people of [[Locri]], warning them against presumption (possibly referring to their war against [[Rhegium]]).<ref>Aristotle ''Rhet.'' 2.21. 1394b-95a, cited by Campbell in ''Loeb'' page 39</ref> [[Philodemus]] believed that the poet once stood between two armies (which two, he doesn't say) and reconciled them with a song {{em dash}} but there is a similar story about [[Terpander]].<ref>Phildemus ''Mus.'' 1.30.31ss, cited by Campbell in ''Loeb'' page 41</ref> According to the 9th century scholar [[Photius]], the term ''eight all'' (used by gamblers at dice) derives from an expensive burial the poet received outside Catana, including a monument with eight pillars, eight steps and eight corners,<ref>Photius ''Lexicon'', cited by Campbell in ''Loeb'' page 45</ref> but the 3rd century grammarian [[Julius Pollux]] attributed the same term to an 'eight all ways' tomb given to the poet outside Himera.<ref>Pollux 9.100, cited by Campbell in ''Loeb'' page 43</ref>

===Career===
Many modern scholars don't accept the ''Suda'''s claim that Stesichorus was named for his innovations in [[choral poetry]] {{em dash}} there are good reasons to believe that his lyrical narratives were composed for solo performance (see [[Stesichorus#Works|Works]] below). Moreover the name wasn't unique {{em dash}} there seems to have been more than one poet of this name<ref name="autogenerated187">Charles Segal, 'Archaic Choral Lyric' – P. Easterling and E. Kenney (eds), ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature'', Cambridge University Press (1985), page 187</ref> (see [[Stesichorus#Spurious works|Spurious works]] below). The ''Suda'' in yet another entry refers to the fact, now verified by Papyrus fragments, that Stesichorus composed verses in units of three stanzas (strophe, antistrophe and epode), a format later followed by poets such as [[Bacchylides]] and [[Pindar]]. ''Suda'' claims this three-stanza format was popularly referred to as ''the three of Stesichorus'' in a proverbial saying rebuking cultural buffoons ("You don't even know the three of Stesichorus!"). According to one modern scholar, however, this saying could instead refer to the following three lines of his poem ''The Palinode'', addressed to Helen of Troy:<ref>note 2 to ''Suda'' T 943, Campbell in ''Loeb'' page 49</ref>
::::There is no truth in that story,
::::You didn't ride in the well-rowed galleys,
::::You didn't reach the walls of Troy.<ref>Plato ''Phaedr.'' 243a, cited by Campbell in ''Loeb'' page 93</ref>

Helen of Troy's bad character was a common theme among poets such as Sappho and Alcaeus<ref>Sappho 16.6–10 and Alcaeus B 10 ''PLF'', cited by Charles Segal, 'Archaic Choral Lyric' – P. Easterling and E. Kenney (eds), ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature'', Cambridge University Press (1985), page 191</ref> and, according to various ancient accounts, Stesichorus viewed her in the same light until she magically punished him with blindness for blaspheming her in one of his poems.<ref>Isocrates ''Hel.'' 64, cited by Campbell in ''Loeb'', page 93</ref> According to a colourful account recorded by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], she later sent an explanation to Stesichorus via a man from [[Crotone|Croton]], who was on a pilgrimage to White Island in the Black Sea (near the mouth of the Blue Danube), and it was in response to this that Stesichorus composed the Palinode,<ref>Pausanias 3.19.11–13, cited by Campbell in ''Loeb'', page 41 (Campbell's translation: "In the Black Sea off the mouths of the Danube there is an island called White Island...''note: Actually off the estuary of the Dnieper.''")</ref> absolving her of all blame for the Trojan War and thus restoring himself to full sight.

==Works==
The ancients associated the lyrical qualities of Stesichorus with the voice of the nightingale, as in this quote from the [[Palatine Anthology]]: "...at his birth, when he had just reached the light of day, a nightingale, travelling through the air from somewhere or other, perched unnoticed on his lips and struck up her clear song."<ref>''Anth.Pal.'' 2.125ss, cited by David Campbell, ''Loeb'', pages 59</ref> The account is repeated by [[Pliny the Elder]]<ref>Plin.''N.H.''10.82, cited by David Campbell, ''Loeb'', page 55</ref> but it was the epic qualities of his work that most impressed ancient commentators,<ref name="autogenerated187"/> though with some reservations on the part of [[Quintilian]]: 
{{Quotation|The greatness of Stesichorus' genius is shown among other things by his subject-matter: he sings of the most important wars and the most famous commanders and sustains on his lyre the weight of epic poetry. In both their actions and their speeches he gives due dignity to his characters, and if only he had shown restraint he could possibly have been regarded as a close rival of Homer; but he is redundant and diffuse, a fault to be sure but explained by the abundance of what he had to say. —Quintilian<ref>Quintilian ''Inst.''10.1.62, cited by David Cambell, ''Loeb'', pages 59</ref>}} 
In a similar vein, [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] commends Stesichorus for "...the magnificence of the settings of his subject matter; in them he has preserved the traits and reputations of his characters",<ref>Dion.Hal.''Imit.''2.421, cited by David Campbell, ''Loeb'', pages 55</ref> and [[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]] puts him in select company with [[Herodotus]], [[Archilochus]] and [[Plato]] as the 'most Homeric' of authors.<ref>Longinus ''de subl.''13.3, cited by David Campbell, ''Loeb'', pages 55</ref>

Modern scholars tend to accept the general thrust of the ancient comments – even the 'fault' noted by Quintilian gets endorsement: 'longwindedness', as one modern scholar calls it, citing, as proof of it, the interval of 400 lines separating Geryon's death from his eloquent anticipation of it.<ref>David A. Campbell, ''Greek Lyric III'', Loeb Classical Library (1991), page 4</ref> Similarly, "the repetitiveness and slackness of the style" of the recently discovered Lille papyrus has even been interpreted by one modern scholar as proof of Stesichorean authorship<ref>Charles Segal, 'Archaic Choral Lyric' – P. Easterling and E. Kenney (eds), ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature'', Cambridge University Press (1985), page 186, note 2</ref> – though others originally used it as an argument against.<ref name="autogenerated7"/> Possibly Stesichorus was even more Homeric than ancient commentators realized – they had assumed that he composed verses for performance by choirs (the triadic structure of the stanzas, comprising strophe, antistrophe and epode, is consistent with choreographed movement) but a poem such as the ''[[Geryoneis]]'' included some 1500 lines and it probably required about four hours to perform – longer than a chorus might reasonably be expected to dance.<ref>C.O.Pavese, ''Tradizione e generi poetici della Graecia arcaica'', Rome (1972), cited by C.Segal, ''The Cambridge History of Greek Literature'', page 187</ref> Moreover, the versatility of lyric meter is suited to solo performance with self-accompaniment on the lyre<ref>M.L.West, 'Stesichorus', ''Classical Quarterly'' 21 (1971) pages 302–14, cited by D.Campbell in ''Greek Lyric III'', page 5</ref> – which is how Homer himself delivered poetry. Whether or not it was a choral technique, the triadic structure of Stesichorean lyrics allowed for novel arrangements of dactylic meter – the dominant meter in his poems and also the defining meter of Homeric epic – thus allowing for Homeric phrasing to be adapted to new settings. However, Stesichorus did more than recast the form of epic poetry – works such as the ''Palinode'' were also a recasting of epic material: in that version of the Trojan War, the combatants fought over a phantom Helen while the real Helen either stayed home or went to Egypt (see a summary [[Stesichorus#The 26 books|below]]). The 'Lyric Age' of Greece was in part self-discovery and self-expression – as in the works of Alcaeus and Sappho – but a concern for heroic values and epic themes still endured:
{{Quotation|Stesichorus' [[Cithara|citharodic]] narrative points to the simultaneous coexistence of different literary genres and currents in an age of great artistic energy and experimentation. It is one of the exciting qualities of early Greek culture that forms continue to evolve, but the old traditions still remain strong as points of stability and proud community, unifying but not suffocating. —Charles Segal.<ref name="autogenerated200">Charles Segal, 'Archaic Choral Lyric' – P. Easterling and E. Kenney (eds), ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature'', Cambridge University Press (1985), page 200</ref>}}

===An 'Homeric' simile===
The Homeric qualities of Stesichorus' poetry are demonstrated in a fragment of his poem ''[[Geryoneis]]'' describing the death of the monster Geryon. A scholiast writing in a margin on Hesiod's ''[[Theogony]]'' noted that Stesichorus gave the monster wings, six hands and six feet, whereas Hesiod himself had only described it as 'three-headed'.<ref>Schol.Hes.''Theog.''287, cited by David Campbell, ''Loeb'', page 89</ref> yet Stesichorus adapted Homeric motifs to create a humanized portrait of the monster,<ref>Charles Segal, 'Archaic Choral Lyric' – P. Easterling and E. Kenney (eds), ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature'', Cambridge University Press (1985), page 190, 194–95</ref> whose death in battle mirrors the death of [[Gorgythion]] in Homer's ''Iliad'', translated here by [[Richmond Lattimore]]:
:::He bent drooping his head to one side, as a garden poppy
:::bends beneath the weight of its yield and the rains of springtime;" (''Iliad'' 8.306-8)<ref>''Iliad'' 8.306-8, translated by Richmond Lattimore, ''The Iliad of Homer'', University of Chicago Press (1951)</ref>
Homer here transforms Gorgythion's death in battle into a thing of beauty{{em dash}}the poppy has not wilted or died.<ref>Susanne Lindgren Wofford, ''The Choice of Achilles: The Ideology of Figure in the Epic''. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1992.</ref> Stesichorus adapted the simile to restore Death's ugliness while still retaining the poignancy of the moment:<ref>Charles Segal, 'Archaic Choral Lyric' – P. Easterling and E. Kenney (eds), ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature'', Cambridge University Press (1985), page 190</ref>
:::Then Geryon rested his neck to one side
::::As might a poppy when it mars
:::The tenderness of its body shedding
::::Suddenly all of its petals... (''Geryoneis'')<ref>''Geryoneis'', P.Oxy.2617 fr.5, cited by D.Campbell, ''Greek Lyric III'' page 76</ref>
The mutual self-reflection of the two passages is part of the novel aesthetic experience that Stesichorus here puts into play.<ref>Richard Garner, ''From Homer to Tragedy: the art of allusion in Greek poetry'', Routledge (1990), page 17</ref> The enduring freshness of his art, in spite of its epic traditions, is borne out by [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] in an anecdote about Socrates: happening to overhear, on the eve of his own execution, the rendition of a song of Stesichorus, the old philosopher asked to be taught it: "So that I may know something more when I depart from life."<ref>Amm.Marc.28.4.15, cited by D.Campbell, ''Greek Lyric III'' page 56</ref>

See [[Lille Stesichorus#The Queen's Speech|The Queen's Speech]] in the Lille fragment for more on Stesichorus's style.

===The 26 books===
His works, according to the Suda, were collected in 26 books but each of these was probably a long, narrative poem. The titles of more than half of them are recorded by ancient sources:<ref>David A. Campbell, ''Greek Lyric Poetry'', Bristol Classical Press (1982), page 254</ref>
*'''Helen''': This might have been the poem in which he portrayed Helen of Troy according to convention as a bad character.<ref name="autogenerated191"/> His interest in the Trojan epic cycle is evinced in a number of works.<ref>See M. Noussia-Fantuzzi in M. Fantuzzi and C. Tsagalis, eds., "The Epic Cycle and Its Ancient Reception," 2015; also P. J. Finglass and A. Kelly, eds. ''Stesichorus in Context'', 2015.</ref>
*'''Helen: Palinodes''': An introduction to a poem of [[Theocritus]] refers to "the first book of Stesichorus's ''Helen''",<ref>Argum.Theocr.18, cited by David Campbell, ''Loeb'', page 91</ref> indicating that there were at least two books under this title. Similarly, a commentary recorded on a papyrus, indicates there were two Palinodes, one censuring Homer, the other Hesiod for the false story that Helen went to Troy.<ref>P.Oxy.2506 fr.26col.i, cited by David Cambell, ''Loeb'', page 97</ref> [[Dio Chrysostom]] summarises two accounts of the Palinode, one in which Helen never sailed for Troy, and a second in which she ended up in Egypt<ref>Dio Chrysostom ''Or.''11.40s, cited by David Campbell, ''Loeb'', page 95</ref> – only her image arrived at Troy. It is not known if either of the two Palinodes was separate from the ''Helen'' book(s).<ref>Charles Segal, 'Archaic Choral Lyric' – P. Easterling and E.

*'''Sack of Troy''': Some scholars think the content of the poem can be deduced from a relief carved onto a monument near Rome, but this is contentious – see the section below [[Stesichorus#Tabula Iliaca|Tabula Iliaca]].
*'''Wooden Horse''': The title was recorded in a fragmentary form on a roll of papyrus: Στη...Ίππ.. ~ Ste(sichorus's Wooden) Hor(se). Possibly it was just an alternative title for ''Sack of Troy''.<ref>David Campbell, ''Loeb'', pages 109, 119</ref>
*'''Nostoi''' ('''The Returns'''): This dealt with the return of the Greek warriors from Troy.
*'''[[Geryoneis]]''': This relates the theft by [[Heracles]] of [[Geryon]]'s cattle. Many recently discovered fragments allow us a glimpse of the poet at work over the length of the entire poem.<ref name="autogenerated193">Charles Segal, 'Archaic Choral Lyric' – P. Easterling and E. Kenney (eds), ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature'', Cambridge University Press (1985), page 193</ref> It includes:
**''romantic geography'' – descriptions of the Sun's voyage in a golden cup under Ocean, of [[Eurytion]]'s homeland, the 'all-golden' [[Hesperides]], and of Pallanteum in [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Arcadia]], which possibly featured as the home of the [[Centaur]], Pholus;
**''poignant speeches'' based on Homeric models – a proud speech by Geryon to Heracles that echoes Sarpedon's speech to Glaucus,<ref>''Iliad'' 12.310-280</ref> and an exchange between Geryon and his mother [[Callirrhoe (Oceanid)|Callirhoe]] that echoes exchanges between [[Achilles]]-[[Thetis]]<ref>''Iliad'' 18</ref> and [[Hector]]-[[Hecuba]];<ref>''Iliad'' 22</ref>
**''heroic action'', again with Homeric colouring – a description of the dying Geryon that echoes the death of [[Gorgythion]].<ref>''Iliad'' 8.306-8.</ref>
*'''Cerberus''': The title is mentioned by [[Julius Pollux]] only because it included the Greek word for a purse but clearly it relates to Heracles's descent into [[Hades]] to fetch [[Cerberus]].<ref>Pollux 10.152, cited by David Campbell, ''Loeb'', page 121</ref>
*'''Cycnus''': A [[scholiast]] commenting on a poem by Pindar summarises the story: Heracles's final triumph over [[Cycnus]] after an initial defeat.<ref>Schol.A.Pind.10.19, cited by David Campbell, ''Loeb'', page 123</ref>
*'''Skylla''': The title is mentioned by a scholiast on [[Apollonius of Rhodes]] in a passing reference to [[Skylla]]'s parentage<ref>Schol.Ap.Rhod.4.825-31, cited by David Campbell, ''Loeb'', page 133</ref> and possibly it involved Heracles.<ref name="autogenerated193"/>
*'''Thebaid''', ''Seven Against Thebes''?: These two titles are conjectured by one modern scholar<ref>David Campbell, ''Loeb'', page 137</ref> as appropriate for the longest fragment attributed to Stesichorus – discovered in 1974 among the wrappings of a mummy of the 2nd century BC stored at the university of [[Lille]], generally known as ''The Lille Stesichorus''. It presents a speech by a Theban queen, possibly [[Jocasta]], and some scholars have denied attribution to Stesichorus on account of its "drab, repetitious flaccidity".<ref>Anne Burnett, "Jocasta in the West: The Lille Stesichorus", ''Classical Antiquity'' Vol.7, No.2 (Oct 1988) page 107</ref> But opinions are mixed and one scholar sees in it "...Stesichorus' full mastery of his technique, handling epic situations and characters with the flexibility and poignancy of lyric."<ref name="autogenerated200"/>
*'''Eriphyle''': The title is mentioned by [[Sextus Empiricus]] in relation to an imaginative account of [[Asclepius]] raising the dead at Thebes.<ref>Sextus Empiricus ''adv.mathem.'' 1.261, cited by David Campbell, ''Loeb'', page 97</ref> Evidently it concerns [[Eriphyle]]'s role in the Theban epic cycle but with an imaginative twist.
*'''Europa''': The title is mentioned by a scholiast on the [[Phoenissae]] of [[Euripides]] in relation to Stesichorus's imaginative variation on the traditional tale of [[Cadmus]], the brother of [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]], sowing dragon's teeth – Stesichorus presented [[Athena]] in that role.<ref>Schol.Eur.''Phoen.'' 670, cited by David Campbell, ''Loeb'', page 101</ref>
*'''Oresteia''': It came in two parts. The title is mentioned by a scholiast on ''[[Peace (play)|Peace]]'', a play by [[Aristophanes]], attributing some of the lyrics to a borrowing from Stesichorus's poem.<ref>Ar.''Pax'' 797ss, cited by David Campbell, ''Loeb'', page 127</ref> The 'second' ''Oresteia'' is mentioned in a scholiast's comment on [[Dionysius of Thrace]], according to which Stesichorus attributed the discovery of the Greek alphabet to [[Palamedes (mythology)|Palamedes]].<ref>Schola.Vat. in Dion.Thrac. ''Art.'' 6, cited by David Campbell, ''Loeb'', page 129</ref>
*'''Boar-hunters''': [[Athenaeus]] mentions the title when quoting a description of a boar nosing the earth and the poem evidently concerned [[Meleager]] and the [[Calydonian Boar]].<ref>Athen. 3.95d, cited by David Campbell, ''Loeb'', page 133</ref>
*'''Funeral Games of [[Pelias]]''': The title is recorded by [[Zenobius]],<ref>Zenobius vi 44, cited by David Campbell, ''Loeb'', page 63</ref> [[Athenaeus]]<ref>Athenaeus 4.172de, cited by David Campbell, ''Loeb'', page 63</ref> and [[Etymologicum Magnum]],<ref>''Et.Mag.'' 544.54, cited by David Campbell, ''Loeb'', page 61</ref> the last two of which also include a handful of quotes.

===Spurious works===
Some poems were wrongly attributed to Stesichorus by ancient sources, including [[Bucolic poetry|bucolic poems]] and some love songs such as ''Calyce'' and ''Rhadine''. It is possible that these are the works of another Stesichorus belonging to the fourth century, mentioned in the [[Marmor Parium]].<ref>''Marm.Par.'' Ep.50, cited by Charles Segal in 'Archaic Choral Lyric' page 192</ref>

==Tabula Iliaca==
[[Bovillae]], about twelve miles outside Rome, was the original site of a monument dating from the Augustan period and now located in the [[Capitoline Museum]]. The stone monument features scenes from the fall of Troy, depicted in low relief, and an inscription: {{lang|grc|Ιλίου Πέρσις κατα Στησίχορον}} ('Sack of Troy according to Stesichorus').<ref>[[Inscriptiones Graecae|I.G.14.1284]]</ref> Scholars are divided as to whether or not it accurately depicts incidents described by Stesichorus in his poem ''Sack of Troy''. There is, for example, a scene showing [[Aeneas]] and his father [[Anchises]] departing 'for [[wikt:Hesperia|Hesperia]]' with 'sacred objects', which might have more to do with the poetry of [[Virgil]] than with that of Stesichorus.<ref>[[Zahra Newby]], ''Art and Inscription in the Ancient World'', Cambridge University Press (2006), Introduction</ref><ref>David A.Campbell, ''Greek Lyric III'', Loeb Classical Library (1991), page 107</ref><ref>Charles Seagal, ''Archaic Choral Lyric'', 'The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature', Cambridge University Press (1985), page 196, note 1</ref>
