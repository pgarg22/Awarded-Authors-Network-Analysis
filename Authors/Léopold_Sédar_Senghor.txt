'''Léopold Sédar Senghor''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ɒ|ŋ|ˈ|ɡ|ɔr}}; {{IPA-fr|sɑ̃ɡɔʁ|lang}}; 9 October 1906 – 20 December 2001) was a [[Senegalese]] poet, politician and cultural theorist who, for two decades, served as the first [[president of Senegal]] (1960–80). Ideologically an [[African socialism|African socialist]], he was the major theoretician of [[Négritude]]. Senghor was also the founder of the [[Senegalese Democratic Bloc]] party. Senghor was the first African elected as a member of the ''[[Académie française]]''. He won the 1985 [[Nonino#Winners|International Nonino Prize]] in Italy. He is regarded by many as one of the most important African intellectuals of the 20th century.

==Early years: 1906–28==
Léopold Sédar Senghor was born on 9 October 1906 in the city of [[Joal]], some 110 kilometres south of [[Dakar]], capital of Senegal. His father, Basile Diogoye Senghor (pronounced: Basile Jogoy Senghor), was a businessman and merchant belonging to the [[bourgeois]] [[Serer people]].<ref name="ReferenceA">Bibliographie, Dakar, Bureau de documentation de la Présidence de la République, 1982 (2e édition), 158 pp.</ref><ref>Robert O. Collins, ''African History: Western African History'', p. 130.</ref><ref>Senegalaisement.com.</ref> Basile Senghor was said to be a wealthy person and owned thousands of cattle and vast lands, some of which were given to him by his cousin the king of [[Kingdom of Sine|Sine]]. Gnilane Ndiémé Bakhoum (1861–1948), Senghor's mother, the third wife of his father, a [[Muslim]] with [[Fula people|Fula]] origin who belonged to the Tabor tribe, was born near Djilor to a Christian family. She gave birth to six children, including two sons.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Senghor's birth certificate states that he was born on 9 October 1906; however, there is a discrepancy with his certificate of baptism, which states it occurred on 9 August 1906.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Washington Ba|first1=Sylvia|title=The Concept of Negritude in the Poetry of Leopold Sedar Senghor|date=8 March 2015|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-400-86713-4|page=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nk19BgAAQBAJ&pg=PA5}}</ref> His Serer middle name ''Sédar'' comes from the [[Serer language]], meaning "one that shall not be humiliated" or "the one you cannot humiliate".<ref>Université De La Vallée D'Aoste.

At the age of eight, Senghor began his studies in Senegal in the [[Ngasobil]] boarding-school of the Fathers of the Holy Spirit. In 1922 he entered a seminary in Dakar. After being told the religious life was not for him, he attended a secular institution. By then, he was already passionate about French literature. He won distinctions in French, Latin, Greek and Algebra. With his Baccalaureate completed, he was awarded a scholarship to continue his studies in France.<ref>Bryan Ryan.

=="Sixteen years of wandering": 1928–1944==
In 1928 Senghor sailed from Senegal for France, beginning, in his words, "sixteen years of wandering."<ref>Jonathan Peters. ''A Dance of Masks: Senghor, Achebe, Soyinka'', Three Continents Press, 1978. {{ISBN|0-914478-23-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-914478-23-2}}.</ref> Starting his post-secondary studies at the [[Sorbonne]], he quit and went on to the [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]] to finish his prep course for entrance to the ''[[École Normale Supérieure]]'', a ''[[grande école]]''. [[Paul Carey (politician)|Paul Cary]], [[Henri Queffélec]], [[Robert Verdier]] and [[Georges Pompidou]] were also studying at this elite institution. After failing the entrance exam, Senghor prepared for his grammar ''[[Agrégation in France|Agrégation]]''. He was granted his ''agrégation'' in 1935 after a failed first attempt.<ref>Janet G. Vaillant. ''Black, French, and African: a life of Léopold Sédar Senghor'', Harvard University Press, 1990. {{ISBN|0-674-07623-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-674-07623-5}}.</ref>

===Academic career===
Senghor graduated from the [[University of Paris]], where he received the Agrégation in French Grammar. Subsequently, he was designated professor at the universities of Tours and Paris, where he taught during the period 1935–45.<ref>''The World Book Encyclopedia'', Vol. 17, World Book, 2000. {{ISBN|0-7166-0100-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7166-0100-5}}.</ref>

Senghor started his teaching years at the lycée René-Descartes in [[Tours]]; he also taught at the lycée Marcelin-Berthelot in [[Saint-Maur-des-Fosses]] near Paris.<ref>Jacques Girault, Lecherbonnier Bernard, Université Paris-Nord. Center for Comparative Literary Studies and French. ''Leopold Sedar Senghor: Africanity – universality: 29–30 May 2000'', Harmattan, 2002. {{ISBN|2-7475-2676-3}}, {{ISBN|978-2-7475-2676-0}}.</ref> He also studied linguistics taught by [[Lilias Homburger]] at the ''[[École pratique des hautes études]]''. He studied with prominent social scientists such as [[Marcel Cohen]], [[Marcel Mauss]] and [[Paul Rivet]] (director of the [[Institut d'ethnologie de Paris]]). Senghor, along with other intellectuals of the African diaspora who had come to study in the colonial capital, coined the term and conceived the notion of "[[négritude]]", which was a response to the racism still prevalent in France. It turned the racial slur ''nègre'' into a positively connoted celebration of African culture and character. The idea of ''négritude'' informed not only Senghor's cultural criticism and literary work, but also became a guiding principle for his political thought in his career as a statesman.<ref>Michelle M. Wright. ''Becoming Black: Creating Identity in the African Diaspora'', Duke University Press, 2004. 0822332884, 9780822332886.</ref>

===Military service===
In 1939, Senghor was enrolled as a French army enlisted man (''2<sup>e</sup> Classe'') with the rank of private within the 59th Colonial Infantry division in spite of his higher education and of his 1932 acquisition of the French Citizenship. A year later in 1940, during the [[Battle of France|German invasion of France]], he was taken prisoner by the Germans in [[la Charité-sur-Loire]]. He was interned in different camps, and finally at Front Stalag 230, in [[Poitiers]]. Front Stalag 230 was reserved for colonial troops captured during the war. German soldiers wanted to execute him and the others the same day they were captured, but they escaped this fate by yelling ''Vive la France, vive l'Afrique noire!'' ("Long live France, long live Black Africa!") A French officer told the soldiers that executing the African prisoners would dishonour the [[Aryan race]] and the [[Wehrmacht|German Army]]. In total, Senghor spent two years in different prison camps, where he spent most of his time writing poems. In 1942 he was released for medical reasons.<ref name="Jamie Stokes 2009">Jamie Stokes. ''Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East'', Vol. 1. Infobase Publishing, 2009. {{ISBN|0-8160-7158-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8160-7158-6}}.</ref>

He resumed his teaching career while remaining involved in the [[French Resistance during World War II|resistance]] during the Nazi occupation.

==Political career: 1945–1982==

===Colonial France===
Once the war was over, Senghor was selected as Dean of the Linguistics Department with the ''[[École nationale de la France d'Outre-Mer]]'', a position he would hold until Senegal's independence in 1960.<ref>''Selected Poems of Leopold Sedar Senghor''. CUP Archive.</ref> While travelling on a research trip for his poetry, he met the local socialist leader, [[Lamine Guèye (politician)|Lamine Guèye]], who suggested that Senghor run for election as a member of the [[French National Assembly|Assemblée nationale française]]. Senghor accepted and became ''député'' for the riding of Sénégal-Mauritanie, when colonies were granted the right to be represented by elected individuals. They took different positions when the train conductors on the line Dakar-Niger went on strike. Guèye voted against the strike, arguing the movement would paralyse the colony, while Senghor supported the workers, which gained him great support among Senegalese.<ref>Jacques Louis Hymans. ''Léopold Sédar Senghor: an intellectual biography'', Edinburgh University Press, 1971. 0852241194, 9780852241196.</ref>

===Political changes===
In 1947, Senghor left the African Division of the [[French Section of the Workers International]] (SFIO), which had given enormous financial support to the social movement. With [[Mamadou Dia]], he founded the ''[[Senegalese Democratic Bloc|Bloc démocratique sénégalais]]'' (1948).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kras|first=Stefan|date=1999|title=Senghor's Rise to Power 1948–1951.

Re-elected deputy in 1951 as an independent overseas member, Senghor was appointed [[Secretary of State#France|state secretary]] to the council's president in [[Edgar Faure]]'s government from 1 March 1955 to 1 February 1956. He became mayor of the city of [[Thiès]], Senegal in November 1956 and then advisory minister in the [[Michel Debré]]'s government from 23 July 1959 to 19 May 1961. He was also a member of the commission responsible for drafting the [[Fifth French Republic|Fifth Republic]]'s constitution, general councillor for Senegal, member of the ''Grand Conseil de l'Afrique Occidentale Francaise'' and member for the parliamentary assembly of the [[European Council]].

In 1964 Senghor published the first volume of a series of five, titled ''Liberté''. The book contains a variety of speeches, essays and prefaces.<ref>Hugues Azèrad, Peter Collier, ''Twentieth-century French poetry: a critical anthology'', Cambridge University Press, 2010. {{ISBN|0-521-71398-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-71398-6}}.</ref>

===Senegal===
Senghor supported federalism for newly independent African states, a type of "French Commonwealth",<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Cooper|first=Frederick|date=2018-01-24|title=The Politics of Decolonization in French and British West Africa|url=https://oxfordre.com/africanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190277734.001.0001/acrefore-9780190277734-e-111|access-date=2021-04-27|website=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of African History|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190277734.013.111|isbn=9780190277734}}</ref> while retaining a degree of French involvement:

Since federalism was not favoured by the African countries, he decided to form, along with [[Modibo Keita]], the [[Mali Federation]] with former [[French Sudan]] (present-day [[Mali]]).<ref name=":0" /> Senghor was president of the Federal Assembly until its failure in 1960.<ref>Africa Bureau (London, England).

Afterwards, Senghor became the first President of the Republic of Senegal, elected on 5 September 1960. He is the author of the Senegalese [[Pincez Tous vos Koras, Frappez les Balafons|national anthem]]. The prime minister, [[Mamadou Dia]], was in charge of executing Senegal's long-term development plan, while Senghor was in charge of foreign relations. The two men quickly disagreed. In December 1962, Mamadou Dia was arrested under suspicion of fomenting a ''coup d'état''. He was held in prison for 12 years. Following this, Senghor created a presidential regime.<ref>Christof Heyns. ''Human Rights Law in Africa 1998'', Vol. 3 of Human Rights Law in Africa.

On 22 March 1967, Senghor survived an assassination attempt.<ref>Sheldon Gellar. ''Senegal: an African nation between Islam and the West'', Westview Press, 1995. 0813310202, 9780813310206</ref> The suspect, [[Moustapha Lô]], pointed his pistol towards the President after he had participated in the sermon of [[Tabaski]], but the gun [[Firearm malfunction|did not fire]]. Lô was sentenced to death for [[treason]] and executed on 15 June 1967, even though it remained unclear if he had actually wanted to kill Senghor.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.loffice.sn/Retour-sur-la-tentative-d.html | title = Retour sur la tentative d'assassinat de Senghor et le meurtre de Demba Diop en 1967&nbsp;: Quand la peine de mort était encore une réalité au Sénégal | first = Abdoulaye | last = Mbow | work = L'OFFice | language = fr | date = 30 April 2011 | access-date = 28 June 2011 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110708204749/http://www.loffice.sn/Retour-sur-la-tentative-d.html | archive-date = 8 July 2011 }}</ref>

Following an announcement at the beginning of December 1980,<ref>"President Leopold Senghor to Retire". ''Liberian Inaugural'' 3 December 1980: 8.</ref> Senghor resigned his position at the end of the year, before the end of his fifth term. [[Abdou Diouf]] replaced him as the head of the country. Under his presidency, Senegal adopted a multi-party system (limited to three: [[Socialist Party of Senegal|socialist]], [[Party of Independence and Labour|communist]] and [[Senegalese Democratic Party|liberal]]).<ref>Stephan Haggard, Steven Benjamin Webb, World Bank.

World Bank Publications, 1994. {{ISBN|0-19-520987-7}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-520987-7}}.</ref> He created a performing education system. Despite the end of official colonialism, the value of Senegalese currency continued to be fixed by France, the language of learning remained French, and Senghor ruled the country with French political advisors.

===Francophonie===
He supported the creation of [[la Francophonie]] and was elected vice-president of the High Council of the Francophonie.

In 1982, he was one of the founders of the Association France and developing countries whose objectives were to bring attention to the problems of developing countries, in the wake of the changes affecting the latter.<ref>[[Hakim Adi]], [[Marika Sherwood]], ''Pan-African History: Political Figures from Africa and the Diaspora Since 1787'', Routledge, 2003. {{ISBN|0-203-41780-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-203-41780-5}}.</ref>

==Académie française: 1983–2001==
He was elected a member of the [[Académie française]] on 2 June 1983, at the [[List of members of the Académie française#Seat 16|16th seat]] where he succeeded [[Antoine de Lévis Mirepoix]]. He was the first African to sit at the Académie.<ref name="Jamie Stokes 2009"/> The entrance ceremony in his honour took place on 29 March 1984, in presence of French President [[François Mitterrand]]. This was considered a further step towards greater openness in the Académie, after the previous election of a woman, [[Marguerite Yourcenar]].

In 1993, the last and fifth book of the ''Liberté'' series was published: ''Liberté 5: le dialogue des cultures.''

==Personal life and death==
Senghor's first marriage was to [[Ginette Éboué]] (1 March 1923 – 1992),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.francaislibres.net/liste/fiche.php?index=96112|title=Ginette Charlotte Andrée Yvonne Eboué épouse Senghor - les Français Libres}}</ref> daughter of [[Félix Éboué]].<ref name=telegraph>{{cite news|title=Léopold Senghor |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1365925/Leopold-Senghor.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=21 December 2001 |access-date=6 April 2012}}</ref> They married on 9 September 1946 and divorced in 1955. They had two sons, Francis in 1947 and Guy in 1948. His second wife, [[:fr:Colette_Senghor|Colette Hubert [fr]]] (20 November 1925 – 18 November 2019),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.france24.com/fr/20191128-le-s%C3%A9n%C3%A9gal-rend-hommage-%C3%A0-colette-senghor-%C3%A9pouse-et-muse-de-l-ancien-pr%C3%A9sident|title = Au Sénégal, dernier hommage à Colette Senghor, épouse et muse de l'ancien président|date = 28 November 2019}}</ref> who was from France, became Senegal's first [[First Lady]] upon independence in 1960. Senghor had three sons between his two marriages.<ref name=telegraph/>

[[File:Stamp of Moldova md068cvs.jpg|thumb|right|2006 Memorial stamp from [[Moldova]]]]
Senghor spent the last years of his life with his wife in [[Verson]], near the city of [[Caen]] in Normandy, where he died on 20 December 2001. His funeral was held on 29 December 2001 in [[Dakar]]. Officials attending the ceremony included [[Raymond Forni]], president of the [[French National Assembly|Assemblée nationale]] and [[Charles Josselin]], state secretary for the minister of foreign affairs, in charge of the Francophonie. [[Jacques Chirac]] (who said, upon hearing of Senghor's death: "Poetry has lost one of its masters, Senegal a statesman, Africa a visionary and France a friend")<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1725044.stm|title=Africa mourns Senegal's Senghor|date=22 December 2001|publisher=[[BBC News]]|access-date=13 August 2008}}</ref> and [[Lionel Jospin]], respectively [[president of the French Republic]] and the [[French prime minister|prime minister]], did not attend. Their failure to attend Senghor's funeral made waves as it was deemed a lack of acknowledgement for what the politician had been in his life. The analogy was made with the [[Senegalese Tirailleurs]] who, after having contributed to the liberation of France, had to wait more than forty years to receive an equal pension (in terms of buying power) to their French counterparts. The scholar [[Érik Orsenna]] wrote in the newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' an editorial entitled "J'ai honte" (I am ashamed).<ref>Erik Orsenna,[http://www.sangonet.com/FichPtsdevuesuite/HonteEOlss.html "J'ai honte"], ''Le Monde'', 4 January 2002.</ref>

==Legacy==
Although a socialist, Senghor avoided the [[Marxist]] and anti-Western ideology that had become popular in post-colonial Africa, favouring the maintenance of close ties with France and the western world.

Senghor's tenure as president was characterised by the development of [[African socialism]], which was created as an indigenous alternative to [[Marxism]], drawing heavily from the ''négritude'' philosophy. In developing this, he was assisted by [[Ousmane Tanor Dieng]]. On 31 December 1980, he retired in favour of his prime minister, [[Abdou Diouf]]. Politically, Senghor's stamp can also be identified today. With regards to Senegal in particular, his willful abdication of power to his successor, Abdou Diouf, led to Diouf's peaceful leave from office as well. Senegal's special relationship to France and economic legacy are more highly contested, but Senghor's impact on democracy remains nonetheless. Senghor managed to retain his identity as both a poet and a politician even throughout his busy careers as both, living by his philosophy of achieving equilibrium between competing forces. Whether it was France and Africa, poetics and politics, or other disparate parts of his identity, Senghor balanced the two.

Literarily, Senghor's influence on political thought and poetic form are wide reaching even through to our modern day. Senghor's poetry endures as the “record of an individual sensibility at a particular moment in history,” capturing the spirit of the Négritude movement at its peak, but also marks a definitive place in literary history.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vaillant |first1=Janet G |title=Homage to Léopold Sédar Senghor: 1906-2001 |journal= Research in African Literatures|date=2002 |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=17–24 |jstor=3820495 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3820495 |access-date=6 December 2020}}</ref> Senghor's thoughts were exceedingly radical for this time, arguing that Africans could only progress if they developed a culture distinct and separate from the colonial powers that oppressed them, pushing against popular thought at the time. Senghor was deeply influenced by poets from the US like Langston Hughes, and his work in turn resonates among today's young US population despite the generations that have passed.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vaillant |first1=Janet G. |title=Homage to Léopold Sédar Senghor: 1906-2001 |journal= Research in African Literatures|date=2002 |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=17–24 |jstor=3820495 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3820495 |access-date=6 December 2020}}</ref>

Seat number 16 of the Académie was vacant after the Senegalese poet's death. He was ultimately replaced by another former president, [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]].

==Honours and awards==
Senghor received several honours in the course of his life. He was made Grand-Croix of the [[Légion d'honneur]], Grand-Croix of the l'[[Ordre national du Mérite]], commander of arts and letters. He also received academic palms and the Grand-Croix of the l'Ordre du lion du Sénégal. His war exploits earned him the medal of Reconnaissance Franco-alliée 1939–1945 and the combattant cross 1939–1945. He was named honorary doctor of thirty-seven universities.

Senghor received the Commemorative Medal of the [[2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire|2500th Anniversary of the founding of the Persian Empire]] on 14 October 1971.<ref name="Grand State Banquet">{{cite web|url=http://badraie.com/guests.htm |title=Grand State Banquet |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305043732/http://badraie.com/guests.htm |archive-date=5 March 2016 }}</ref>

On 13 November 1978, he was created a Knight of the Collar of the [[Order of Isabella the Catholic]] of Spain. Members of the order at the rank of knight and above enjoy personal [[nobility]] and have the privilege of adding a golden heraldic mantle to their coats of arms.

The French Language International University in Alexandria was officially open in 1990 and was named after him.

In 1994 he was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award by the [[African Studies Association]]; however, there was controversy about whether he met the standard of contributing "a lifetime record of outstanding scholarship in African studies and service to the Africanist community."<ref>[http://www.africanstudies.org/?page=awards_distinguished "Distinguished Africanist Award 2009"] African Studies Association.</ref> [[Michael Mbabuike]], president of the New York African Studies Association (NYASA), said that the award also honours those who have worked "to make the world a better place for mankind."<ref>Bensaid, Alexandra, and Andrew Whitehead (1995), "Literature: Award to Senghor Triggers Debate" IPS-Inter Press Service, 18 April 1995, accessed via the commercial service Lexis/Nexis, 30 December 2008.</ref>

==Poetry==
[[File:Senghor Universita degli Studi di Genova (Jan. 18 1988).jpg|thumb|Senghor signing a copy of his ''Poèmes'', [[Universita degli Studi di Genova]] (18 January 1988).]]
His poetry was widely acclaimed, and in 1978 he was awarded the [[Prix mondial Cino Del Duca]].
His poem "A l'appel de la race de Saba", published in 1936, was inspired by the entry of Italian troops in Addis Ababa.
In 1948, Senghor compiled and edited a volume of Francophone poetry called ''Anthologie de la nouvelle poésie nègre et malgache'' for which [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] wrote an introduction, entitled "Orphée Noir" (Black Orpheus).

For his epitaph was a poem he had written, namely:

:''Quand je serai mort, mes amis, couchez-moi sous Joal-l'Ombreuse.''
:''Sur la colline au bord du Mamanguedy, près l'oreille du sanctuaire des Serpents.''
:''Mais entre le Lion couchez-moi et l'aïeule Tening-Ndyae.''
:''Quand je serai mort mes amis, couchez-moi sous Joal-la-Portugaise.''
:''Des pierres du Fort vous ferez ma tombe, et les canons garderont le silence.''
:''Deux lauriers roses-blanc et rose-embaumeront la Signare.''

:''When I'm dead, my friends, place me below Shadowy Joal,''
:''On the hill, by the bank of the Mamanguedy, near the ear of Serpents' Sanctuary.''
:''But place me between the Lion and ancestral Tening-Ndyae.''
:''When I'm dead, my friends, place me beneath Portuguese Joal.''
:''Of stones from the Fort build my tomb, and cannons will keep quiet.''
:''Two oleanders – white and pink – will perfume the Signare.''

==Négritude==
With [[Aimé Césaire]] and [[Léon Damas]], Senghor created the concept of ''[[Négritude]]'', an important intellectual movement that sought to assert and to valorise what they believed to be distinctive African characteristics, values, and aesthetics. One of these African characteristics that Senghor theorised was asserted when he wrote "the Negro has reactions that are more ''lived,'' in the sense that they are more direct and concrete expressions of the sensation and of the stimulus, and so of the object itself with all its original qualities and power." This was a reaction against the too strong dominance of French culture in the colonies, and against the perception that Africa did not have culture developed enough to stand alongside that of Europe. In that respect ''négritude'' owes significantly to the pioneering work of [[Leo Frobenius]].

Building upon historical research identifying ancient Egypt with black Africa, Senghor argued that sub-Saharan Africa and Europe are in fact part of the same cultural continuum, reaching from Egypt to classical Greece, through Rome to the European colonial powers of the modern age. [[Négritude]] was by no means—as it has in many quarters been perceived—an anti-white racism, but rather emphasised the importance of dialogue and exchange among different cultures (e.g., European, African, Arab, etc.).

A related concept later developed in [[Mobutu]]'s [[Zaire]] is that of ''[[Authenticité (Zaire)|authenticité]]'' or Authenticity.

=== Décalage ===
In colloquial French, the term décalage is used to describe jetlag, lag or a general discrepancy between two things. However, Senghor uses the term to describe the unevenness in the African Diaspora. The complete phrase he uses is "Il s'agit, en réalité, d'un simple décalage—dans le temps et dans l'espace", meaning that between Black Africans and African Americans there exists an inconsistency, both temporally and spatially. The time element points to the advancing or delaying of a schedule or agenda, while the space aspects designates the displacing and shifting of an object. The term points to a "a bias that refuses to pass over when one crosses the water". He asks, how can we expect any sort of solidarity or intimacy from two populations that diverged over 500 years ago?
