==Dutch East Indies literature==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Theeplukster Preanger TMnr 10011957.jpg|thumb|left|Tea plantation in the [[Preanger]] mountains, West Java, the area where Haasse's novel ''The Tea Lords'' is set and which she visited.]]

An important segment of her literary work consists of [[Dutch Indies literature]]. Her debut ''Oeroeg'' (1948), is set in the [[Dutch East Indies]], where Haasse was born and lived for most of the first 20 years of her life. Even more autobiographical texts and books about her life in the East Indies, includes books such as  The East Indies continued to play an important part in her work: ''Krassen op een rots'' (1970) and her last novel ''Sleuteloog'' (2002), which has the same theme as ''Oeroeg'': is a friendship between a Dutch colonial and an Indonesian child possible and can they really understand each other?

This ''Oeroeg'' was well received and often reprinted, but did experience some controversy due to the critical reception by the older author [[Tjalie Robinson]]. The [[Indo people|Indo (Eurasian)]] Tjalie Robinson pointed out why he did not find the characters in the story credible. Moreover, as Tjalie Robinson himself was still living in the Dutch East Indies at that time, hoping for and working towards fraternization between the Dutch and Indonesians his sharp criticism was directed against what he considered the defeatist nature of the book.<ref>[http://stichtingtongtong.nl/2011/09/hella-haasse-1918-2011/  Tong Tong Foundation memorial 2011]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>[http://siemboon.nl/indisch/indo-totok/geworteld-in-indie/  Siem Boon website.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425051256/http://siemboon.nl/indisch/indo-totok/geworteld-in-indie/ |date=25 April 2012 }}</ref>

The movie ''Oeroeg'' based on the book premiered in 1993.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hellahaassemuseum.nl/objects/169.html |title=Official Online Hella Haasse Museum. |access-date=6 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302110321/http://www.hellahaassemuseum.nl/objects/169.html |archive-date=2 March 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Her internationally acclaimed ''Heren van de Thee'' was translated as ''The Tea Lords'' in 2010. It is a colonial historical novel set in the Dutch East Indies of the 19th and 20th century, based on family archives of the heirs and relations of the tea plantation owners featuring in the book.<ref>Evans, Julian ''The Tea Lords by Hella S Haasse – review'' (The Guardian, Saturday 4 December 2010) See: [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/dec/04/tea-lords-hella-haasse-review  The Guardian and Observer Online Book Review].</ref>

==Awards==
Her great commercial success and critical acclaim is reflected in the numerous prizes she has been awarded over the years. She has won prizes for both her first novel in 1948 as well as her last novel in 2003. Prestigious awards for her entire oeuvre up to that time include the [[Constantijn Huygens Prize]] in 1981 and the [[P. C. Hooft Award]] in 1984. Various other prizes include the ‘’Annie Romein Prize’’and the ‘’Dirk Martens Prize’’. She has also won the ‘’Prize of the Public of the NS’’ twice and is the only author who has written the prestigious annual "[[Boekenweek]]geschenk" thrice, in 1948, 1959 and 1994 respectively.

==International recognition==
Haasse lived in France for many years (1981–1990), and much of her work has been translated into French. The '‘Académie Française’' awarded Haasse the ''Diplôme de médaille Argent'' in 1984. The next year she delivered a presentation on colonial literature at the [[University of Dakar]]. She was awarded the ''Officier dans l’Ordre de la [[Légion d'Honneur]]'' in 2000.

Haasse received an honorary literary doctorate from the [[University of Utrecht]] in 1988 and from the Belgian [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven|University of Leuven]] in 1995. In 1987 she had already been given an honorary membership of the Belgian Royal Literary Academy (Belgische Koninklijke Academie voor Nederlandse Taal- en Letterkunde (KANTL)) in [[Ghent|Gent]].

The Chilean Ministry of Education (‘El Ministerio de education de Chile') awarded her a prize for her “universal contribution to culture” in 1996.

In 1989 the city of Boston awarded her the 'Boston Certificate of Recognition', for her book ''[[In a Dark Wood Wandering]]'': “In recognition and appreciation of your outstanding contributions to the City of Boston and its residents.”

In 1992 Haasse attended the opening of the IKAPI 'International Book Fair' in [[Jakarta]]. It was the last time she would visit her birthplace, [[Java]], and the year her [[Dutch Indies literature]] masterpiece ''Heren van de Thee'' was published.
