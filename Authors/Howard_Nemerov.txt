==Biography==
Nemerov was born on March 1, 1920 in New York City;<ref>{{cite book |last1=Duncan |first1=Bowie (ed.) |title=The Critical Reception of Howard Nemerov |date=1971 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=9780810804005 |page=7}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Meinke |first1=Peter |title=Howard Nemerov |date=1968 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |isbn=9780816652174 |page=6}}</ref> his parents were David Nemerov and Gertrude Russek. The Nemerovs were a [[Russian Jewish]] couple who lived in New York City and owned [[Russeks]], a [[Fifth Avenue]] department store. His younger sisters were the photographer [[Diane Arbus]] and sculptor/painter Renee Nemerov Sparkia Brown.  The elder Nemerov's talents and interests extended to art connoisseurship, painting, [[philanthropy]], and photography &mdash; talents and interests undoubtedly influential upon his son. Young Howard was raised in a sophisticated New York City environment where he attended the Society for [[Ethical Culture Fieldston School|Ethical Culture's Fieldston School]]. Graduated in 1937 as an outstanding student and second string team football fullback, he commenced studies at Harvard University where, in 1940, he was Bowdoin Essayist and he received bachelor's degree at this university. Throughout [[World War II]], he served as a pilot, first in the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] and later the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]]. He married in 1944, and after the war, having earned the rank of first lieutenant, returned to New York with his wife to complete his first book.

Nemerov then began teaching, first at [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] and later at [[Bennington College]], [[Brandeis University]], and finally [[Washington University in St. Louis]], where he was [[Edward Mallinckrodt]] Distinguished University Professor of English and Distinguished Poet in Residence from 1969 until his death in 1991. In 1999, Washington University dedicated a dormitory, The Howard Nemerov House, to him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wustl.edu/community/visitors/tour/danforth/nemerov-house.html|title=Howard Nemerov House}}</ref> Nemerov's numerous collections of poetry include ''Trying Conclusions: New and Selected Poems, 1961-1991'' (University of Chicago Press, 1991); ''The Collected Poems of Howard Nemerov'' (1977), which won the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, and the Bollingen Prize; ''The Winter Lightning: Selected Poems'' (1968); ''Mirrors and Windows'' (1958); ''The Salt Garden'' (1955); and ''The Image and the Law'' (1947). His novels have also been commended; they include ''The Homecoming Game'' (1957), ''Federigo: Or the Power of Love'' (1954), and ''The Melodramatists'' (1949).

Nemerov received many awards and honors, among them fellowships from The [[Academy of American Poets]] and The [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]], a [[National Endowment for the Arts]] grant, the [[National Medal of Arts]], the [[Bollingen Prize]] for Poetry, the [[St. Louis Literary Award]] from the [[Saint Louis University]] Library Associates,<ref>[http://www.slu.edu/libraries/associates/award.html Website of St. Louis Literary Award]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://lib.slu.edu/about/associates/literary-award |title=Recipients of the Saint Louis Literary Award |author=Saint Louis University Library Associates |access-date=July 25, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160731082313/http://lib.slu.edu/about/associates/literary-award |archive-date=July 31, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and the first [[Aiken Taylor Award for Modern American Poetry]].<ref>{{cite news | author=Staff writers | title=Nemerov First Winner Of Taylor Poetry Prize| work=New York Times| date=18 January 1987 | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5D7173EF93BA25752C0A961948260| access-date=2009-01-19 }}</ref>

Nemerov served as poetry consultant to the Library of Congress in 1963 and 1964, as a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets beginning in 1976, and two terms as poet laureate of the United States from 1988 to 1990. In 1990 he was inducted into the [[St. Louis Walk of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stlouiswalkoffame.org/inductees/?view=achievement|title=St. Louis Walk of Fame Inductees|last=St. Louis Walk of Fame|publisher=stlouiswalkoffame.org|access-date=25 April 2013|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6E7tA66dm?url=http://www.stlouiswalkoffame.org/inductees/?view=achievement|archive-date=2 February 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Nemerov died of cancer in 1991 in [[University City, Missouri]]. The [[Howard Nemerov Sonnet Award]] was instituted in 1994 to honor him, and by 2008 about 3000 sonnets were entered annually in the associated competition.<ref name=Juster>{{cite journal |url=http://www.14by14.com/Issue6/SoYouWanttoWinaNemerov.html |title=So you want to win a Nemerov? |first=Mike |last=Juster |journal=14by14 |issue=6 |date=October 2008 |access-date=2009-03-25}}</ref>

== Poetry ==
Nemerov's work is formalist. He wrote almost exclusively in fixed forms and meter. While he is known for his meticulousness and refined technique, his work also has a reputation for being witty and playful. He is compared to [[John Hollander]] and [[Philip Larkin]].

"A Primer of the Daily Round" is his most frequently anthologized poem, and highly representative of Nemerov's poetic style. It is an archetypal Elizabethan sonnet, demonstrative of the prosodic creativity for which Nemerov is famous. Another widely appreciated poem is "The War in the Air," which draws on his wartime experience as a pilot.<ref>[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/177169 "'The War in the Air' By Howard Nemerov"]. Poetry Foundation.</ref>

Nemerov's "Because You Asked about the Line between Prose and Poetry" is frequently taught as an example of an [[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]] as it describes the nearly imperceptible change between rain and snow while still maintaining the formal poetic elements of rhyme and meter. A critical review by Mary Kinzie said of it: "the poem imperceptibly thickens itself out of the stream of prose."<ref>{{cite web|last=Kinzie|first=Mary|title=The Judge Is Rue|url=http://www.bookrags.com/criticism/howard-nemerov-crit2_33/|publisher=Poetry Magazine|access-date=16 July 2012}}</ref>

Nemerov also published a short story in the book ''Stories Selected from  the Unexpected'' by Bennett Cerf under the pseudonym Joseph Cross called "Exchange of Men". http://www.philsp.com/homeville/anth/s194.htm
