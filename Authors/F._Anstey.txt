'''Thomas Anstey Guthrie''' (8 August 1856 – 10 March 1934) was an English author (writing as '''F. Anstey'''), most noted for his comic novel ''[[Vice Versa (novel)|Vice Versa]]'' about a boarding-school boy and his father exchanging identities. His reputation was confirmed by ''The Tinted Venus'' and many humorous parodies in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine.

==Early life and family==

He was born in [[Kensington]], London, to [[Augusta Amherst Austen]], an organist and composer, and Thomas Anstey Guthrie. He was educated at [[King's College School]] and at [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]], and was called to the bar in 1880.<ref>{{acad|id=GTRY875TA|name=Guthrie, Thomas Anstey}}</ref>

Guthrie married and his younger brother was the physician [[Leonard Guthrie]] (1858–1918).<ref name="AIMs">[https://aim25.com/cgi-bin/vcdf/detail?coll_id=7179&inst_id=8&nv1=search&nv2= GUTHRIE, Leonard George (1858–1918).] AIM25.

==Writing career==
The popular success of his story ''[[Vice Versa (novel)|Vice Versa]]'' (1882) with its topsy turvy substitution of a father for his schoolboy son, at once made his reputation as a humorist of an original type. In 1883, he published a serious novel, ''The Giant's Robe'', which [[George Gissing]] described as 'very poor stuff'.<ref>Coustillas, Pierre ed. London and the Life of Literature in Late Victorian England: the Diary of George Gissing, Novelist. Brighton: Harvester Press, 1978, p.266.</ref> Anstey discovered (and again in 1889 with ''The Pariah'') that it was not as a serious novelist but as a humorist that the public insisted on regarding him. As such, his reputation was further confirmed by ''The Black Poodle'' (1884), ''The Tinted Venus'' (1885), ''A Fallen Idol'' (1886), and other works.

Guthrie became an important member of the staff of ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine, in which his ''[[voces populi]]'' and his humorous parodies of a reciter's stock-piece (''Burglar Bill, &c.'') represent his best work. In 1903, his successful farce ''[[The Man from Blankley's]]'' based on a story that originally appeared in ''Punch'', was first produced by [[Charles Hawtrey (actor, born 1858)|Sir Charles Hawtrey]] at the [[Prince of Wales Theatre]], in London; it starred Hawtrey, [[Arthur Playfair]] and [[Faith Compton Mackenzie|Faith Stone]]. After London, it played in New York, Washington DC, Detroit and Chicago.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mackenzie|first=Faith Compton|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/as-much-as-i-dare/oclc/59635156|title=As much as I dare.|publisher=Collins|year=1938|pages=150–153|language=en|oclc=59635156}}</ref> He wrote ''Only Toys'' (1903) and ''Salted Almonds'' (1906).<ref name=NIE>[[New International Encyclopedia]]</ref>

Many of Anstey's stories have been adapted into theatrical productions and motion pictures. 

''The Tinted Venus'' was adapted into a silent film, [[The Tinted Venus]], in 1921.

''The Tinted Venus'' was adapted by [[S. J. Perelman]], [[Ogden Nash]], and [[Kurt Weill]] into ''[[One Touch of Venus]]'' in 1943.  A 1948 film, [[One Touch of Venus (film)|One Touch of Venus]], was based on Guthrie's book and the musical.

''Vice Versa'' was [[Vice Versa (play)|adapted as a play]] in 1883 and has been filmed many times, usually transposed in setting and without any credit to the original book. Another of his novels, ''The Brass Bottle'', has also been filmed more than once, including ''[[The Brass Bottle (1964 film)|The Brass Bottle]]'' (1964). His ''[[Tourmalin's Time Cheques]]'' (1891) is one of the earliest stories featuring the science fiction [[Time travel in fiction|concept of intentional and frequent movement in time]], and probably the first to investigate the practical paradoxes such a concept would create.

Guthrie wrote an autobiography, under both his pen and true names, in 1936 entitled ''A Long Retrospect''.<ref>{{Internet Archive|id=in.ernet.dli.2015.78574|name=A Long Retrospect}}</ref>
