'''Tadeusz Borowski''' ({{IPA-pl|taˈdɛ.uʂ bɔˈrɔfskʲi}}; 12 November 1922 – 3 July 1951) was a Polish writer and [[journalist]]. His wartime poetry and stories dealing with his experiences as a prisoner at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] are recognized as classics of [[Polish literature]].

== Early life ==
Borowski was born in 1922 into the Polish community in [[Zhytomyr]], [[Ukrainian SSR]] (today [[Ukraine]]).<ref name=tad>{{cite book |title=A Study Guide for Tadeusz Borowski's "Silence" |publisher=Gale Cengage Learning |isbn=9781410388483 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lLVSDwAAQBAJ |access-date=26 July 2019}}</ref> In 1926, his father, whose bookstore had been [[nationalization|nationalized]] by the communists, was sent to a camp in the [[Gulag]] system in [[Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Russian Karelia]] because he had been a member of a Polish military organization during [[World War I]]. In 1930, Borowski's mother was [[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|deported to a settlement]] on the shores of the [[Yenisey]], in Siberia, during [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|Collectivization]]. During this time Tadeusz lived with his aunt.

Borowski and his family were targeted (as [[Poles]]) by the [[Soviet Union]] during [[Stalin's Great Terror]]. In 1932, the Borowskis were expatriated to Poland by the [[Red Cross|Polish Red Cross]] in an exchange for Communist prisoners. Impoverished, the family settled in [[Warsaw]].<ref name=tad />

== Experiences under Nazi occupation ==
{{see|Siege of Warsaw (1939)}}

Under Nazi occupation, Poles were forbidden to attend university or even secondary school. In 1940 Borowski finished his secondary schooling in Nazi-occupied Poland in an [[Underground education in Poland during World War II|underground]] ''lyceum''. He graduated from high school in 1940 amid the [[Roundup (history)|roundups]] of Jewish residents. He began his underground studies in [[Polish literature]] at [[Warsaw University]]. His classes met in secret at private homes. While attending university he met Maria Rundo, who would become the love of his life.<ref name=tad />

He also became involved with the leftist publication ''Droga''. ''Wherever the Earth'' (1942),  his anonymously self-published collection of poems, was distributed illegally. The poems have been described by modern scholars as "remarkable for their dark view of the earth as an enormous labor camp".

While a member of the educational underground in Warsaw, Borowski was engaged and living with Rundo. After Maria did not return home one night in February 1943, Borowski began to suspect that she had been arrested. Rather than staying away from any of their usual meeting places, though, he walked straight into the trap that was set by the [[Gestapo]] agents in the apartment of his and Maria's close friend. Borowski was 21 years old when he was imprisoned in [[Pawiak]] prison for two months before he was shipped to [[Auschwitz]] that April.<ref name=tad />

Forced into [[slave labor]] in extremely harsh conditions, Borowski later reflected on this experience in his writing. In particular, working on a railway ramp in Auschwitz-Birkenau, he witnessed arriving Jews being told to leave their personal property behind, and then being transferred directly from the trains to the gas chambers. While a prisoner at Auschwitz, Borowski caught [[pneumonia]]; afterwards, he was put to work in a [[Nazi human experimentation|Nazi medical experiment]] "hospital." He was able to maintain written and personal contact with his fiancée, who was also imprisoned in Auschwitz.<ref name=intro/>

In late 1944 Borowski was transported from Auschwitz to the Dautmergen subcamp of [[Natzweiler-Struthof]], and finally to [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]].<ref name=tad /> Dachau-Allach, where Borowski was imprisoned, was liberated by the Americans on 1 May 1945; after that Borowski found himself in a [[Displaced Persons camp|camp for displaced persons]] near [[Munich]].

==After the war==
He spent some time in [[Paris]], and then returned to Poland on 31 May 1946. His fiancée, who had survived the camps and emigrated to [[Sweden]], returned to Poland in late 1946, and they were married in December 1946.<ref name=intro/>

Borowski turned to prose after the war, believing that what he had to say could no longer be expressed in verse. His series of short stories about life in Auschwitz was published as ''Pożegnanie z Marią'' (''Farewell to Maria'', English title ''[[This Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen]]''). The main stories are written in the first person from the perspective of an Auschwitz inmate; they describe the morally numbing effect of everyday terror, with prisoners, trying to survive, often being indifferent or mean towards each other; the privileges of non-Jewish inmates like Borowski; and the absence of any heroism. Early on after its publication in Poland, the work was accused of being nihilistic, amoral and decadent.<ref name=intro/> His short story cycle ''World of Stone'' describes his time in displaced person camps in Germany.

Borowski's poem ''Silence'' was written in the aftermath of the [[Dachau liberation reprisals|liberation of Dachau]]. The poem is set in the newly liberated concentration camp and opens with imagery depicting a disgraced SS officer being dragged into an alley by a mob of prisoners who try to tear him apart with their bare hands. They return to the barracks and the scene is one of communal food preparation, prisoners noisily grinding [[grain]], slicing meat, mixing [[pancake]] batter and peeling potatoes in the narrow paths that wind between their bunk beds. They are playing cards and drinking hot soup when an American officer arrives. While expressing sympathy for the prisoners seeking vengeance against their captors, he urges restraint, and promises punishment under law. Some prisoners begin to debate where to kill the American officer, but the crowd begins to applaud the officer's promise of justice. When the American officer leaves the camp the prisoners return to the SS officer from the opening scene and trample him to death.<ref name=tad />

The Polish government considered the poem "amoral"<ref name=tad /> but Borowski found work as a journalist. He joined the Soviet-controlled [[Polish Workers' Party]] in 1948 and wrote political tracts as well. At first he believed that Communism was the only political force truly capable of preventing any future Auschwitz from happening. In 1950 he received the National Literary Prize, Second Degree.

In the summer of 1949 he was sent to work in the Press Section of the Polish Military Mission in [[Berlin]]. He returned to Warsaw a year later and entered into an extramarital affair with a young girl.<ref name=intro/>

Soon after a close friend of his (the same friend who had earlier been imprisoned by the Gestapo, and in whose apartment both Borowski and his fiancée had been arrested)<ref name=intro/> was imprisoned and tortured by the Communists. Borowski tried to intervene on his behalf and failed; he became completely disillusioned with the socialist regime.<ref name=tad />

==Death==
On July 3, 1951, at the age of 28, Borowski died by [[suicide]]<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/haslo/Borowski-Tadeusz;3879730.html|title=Borowski Tadeusz|work=Encyklopedia PWN|language=pl}}</ref> by breathing in gas from a gas stove. His wife had given birth to their daughter, [http://www.signandsight.com/features/1206.html Małgorzata], a few days prior to his death.<ref name=intro>{{cite book|contributor-last=Kott |contributor-first=Jan |contributor-link=Jan Kott |last=Borowski|first=Tadeusz|editor1-first=Barbara|editor1-last=Vedder|contribution=Introduction|title=This Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen|url=https://archive.org/details/thiswayforgaslad00bororich|url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/thiswayforgaslad00bororich/page/20 20] |access-date=August 28, 2009|year=1976|publisher=Penguin Classics|isbn=978-0-14-018624-6}}</ref>

"On 6 July 1951, the openly anti-militarist Borowski was buried, of all places, in the military section of Powązki National Cemetery in Warsaw to the strains of '[[The Internationale]]', and was posthumously awarded the highest honours. An obituary notice in ''Nowa Kultura'' was signed by 86 writers. Soon after, a special issue of this weekly newspaper appeared with contributions from the elite of Polish literature. Since then, countless texts, poem and articles by and about Borowski have been published, as well as many books in various languages and editions," writes Holocaust survivor [[Arno Lustiger|Arnold Lustiger]] in [http://www.signandsight.com/features/1206.html ''Die Welt''.]The book "This Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen" is now also published as part of 'Penguin Classics', further cementing Borowski's place amongst literary greats.
