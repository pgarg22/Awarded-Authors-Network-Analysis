'''Melanie Rawn''' (born 1954) is an American author of [[fantasy]] literature. She received a BA in history from [[Scripps College]] and worked as a teacher and editor before becoming a writer.

She has been nominated for a [[Locus Awards|Locus award]] on three occasions: in 1989 for ''Dragon Prince'' in the first novel category, in 1994 for ''Skybowl'' in the fantasy novel category, and again in 1995 for ''Ruins of Ambrai'' in the fantasy novel category. The third novel in the "Exiles" trilogy has now been "forthcoming" since the late 1990s due to the author suffering from clinical depression and moving on to other projects to facilitate her recovery.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rawn|first=Melanie|title=Spellbinder: A Love Story With Magical Interruptions|year=2007|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-7653-5436-5|pages=499â€“500}}</ref> Rawn gave an interview in 2014 with [[Kate Elliot]]'s blog where she announced that she intended to complete the trilogy after finishing the fifth book of the ''Glass Thorns'' series.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Kate Elliot|authorlink1=Kate Elliot|title=Update on Melanie Rawn's EXILES 3, The Captal's Tower|url=http://www.imakeupworlds.com/index.php/2014/07/update-on-melanie-rawns-exiles-3-the-captals-tower/|website=I Make Up Worlds|access-date=15 May 2018}}</ref>
