==Biography==
[[File:Photograph of Sara Teasdale as a young girl.jpg|thumb|left|Photograph of Sara Teasdale as a young girl]]

Sara Teasdale was born on August 8, 1884. She had poor health for much of her childhood, so she was home schooled until age 9. It was at age 10 that she was well enough to begin school. She started at Mary Institute in 1898, but switched to [[Hosmer Hall]] in 1899, graduating in 1903. The Teasdale family lived at 3668 Lindell Blvd. and then 38 Kingsbury Place in St. Louis, Missouri. Both homes were designed by Sara's mother. The house on Kingsbury Place had a private suite for Sara on the second floor. Guests entered through a separate entrance and were admitted by appointment. This suite is where Sara worked, slept, and often dined alone.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/LiterarySt.Louis|title=Literary St. Louis|publisher=Associates of St. Louis University Libraries, Inc. and Landmarks Association of St. Louis, Inc.|year=1969|location=St. Louis, Missouri}}</ref>

From 1904 to 1907, Teasdale was a member of [[The Potters (artists group)|The Potters]], led by [[Lillie Rose Ernst]], a group of female artists in their late teens and early twenties who published, from 1904 to 1907, ''The Potter's Wheel,'' a monthly artistic and literary magazine in St. Louis.<ref name="stlouislgbthistory">{{cite web|title=1900-1960s|url=http://www.stlouislgbthistory.com/timeline/1900-1960s.html|website=Saint Louis LGBT History Project|access-date=29 July 2017}}</ref>

Teasdale's first poem was published in [[William Marion Reedy]]'s ''[[Reedy's Mirror]]'', a local newspaper, in 1907. Her first collection of poems, ''Sonnets to Duse and Other Poems'', was published that same year.

Teasdale's second collection, ''Helen of Troy and Other Poems'', was published in 1911.<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Helen of Troy and Other Poems |year=1911}}</ref> It was well received by critics, who praised its lyrical mastery and romantic subject matter.

From 1911 to 1914 Teasdale was courted by several men, including the poet [[Vachel Lindsay]], who was truly in love with her but did not feel that he could provide enough money or stability to keep her satisfied. She chose to marry [[Ernst Filsinger]], a longtime admirer of her poetry, on December 19, 1914.

Teasdale's third poetry collection, ''Rivers to the Sea'', was published in 1915. It was and is a bestseller, being reprinted several times. In 1916 she and Filsinger moved to New York City, where they lived in an [[Upper West Side]] apartment on Central Park West.

In 1918 she won a [[Pulitzer Prize]] for her 1917 poetry collection ''Love Songs''. It was "made possible by a special grant from [[Poetry Society of America|The Poetry Society]]"; however, the sponsoring organization now lists it as the earliest [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]] (inaugurated 1922).<ref name=pulitzer>[http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat/Poetry "Poetry"]. The Pulitzer Prizes. Retrieved 2013-11-24.</ref>

Filsinger's constant business travel caused Teasdale much loneliness.<ref>Letters from Sara Teasdale to Mr. Braithwaite expressing her loneliness can be accessed at the Berg Collection.</ref> In 1929, she moved interstate for three months, thereby satisfying the criteria to gain a divorce. She did not wish to inform Filsinger, only doing so at her lawyers' insistence as the divorce was going through. Filsinger was shocked. After the divorce she moved only two blocks from her old home on Central Park West. She rekindled her friendship with Vachel Lindsay, who was now married with children.

In 1933, she died by suicide, overdosing on sleeping pills.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poemhunter.com/sara-teasdale/biography/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219025601/http://www.poemhunter.com/sara-teasdale/biography/|url-status=dead|archive-date=19 February 2015|title=Sara Teasdale (1884–1933)|access-date=22 April 2009}}</ref> Lindsay had died by suicide two years earlier. She is interred in [[Bellefontaine Cemetery]] in St. Louis.

== Teasdale's suicide and "I Shall Not Care" ==
A common [[urban legend]] surrounds Teasdale's suicide.  The poem "I Shall Not Care" was speculated to be her suicide note because of its depressing undertone.  The legend claims that her poem "I Shall Not Care" (which features themes of abandonment, bitterness, and contemplation of death) was penned as a suicide note to a former lover.<ref>[http://www.rarenewspapers.com/view/662442?imagelist=1 Rare Newspapers]</ref> However, the poem was actually first published in her 1915 collection ''Rivers to the Sea'', a full 18 years before her suicide:<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Rivers to the Sea |wslink=Rivers to the Sea (Collection) |year=1919 |publisher=MACMILLAN & CO}}</ref>

;I Shall Not Care
WHEN I am dead and over me bright April
::Shakes out her rain-drenched hair,
:Tho' you should lean above me broken-hearted,
:::I shall not care.

I shall have peace, as leafy trees are peaceful
:::When rain bends down the bough,
:And I shall be more silent and cold-hearted
:::Than you are now.
