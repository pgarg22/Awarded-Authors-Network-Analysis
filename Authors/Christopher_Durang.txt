'''Christopher Ferdinand Durang''' (born January 2, 1949) is an American [[playwright]] known for works of outrageous and often [[Theatre of the Absurd|absurd]] comedy. His work was especially popular in the 1980s, though his career seemed to get a second wind in the late 1990s.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} ''[[Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All For You]]'' was Durang's watershed play as it brought him to national prominence when it won him—at the age of 32—the Obie Award for Best Playwright (1980). His play, ''[[Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike]]'' won the [[Tony Award for Best Play]] in 2013. The production was directed by Nicholas Martin, and featured [[Sigourney Weaver]], [[David Hyde Pierce]], [[Kristine Nielsen]], [[Billy Magnussen]], [[Shalita Grant]] and [[Genevieve Angelson]].

He is co-director of the Lila Acheson Wallace American Playwrights Program at [[Juilliard]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Juilliard.

==Life==
Durang was born in [[Montclair, New Jersey]], the son of Patricia Elizabeth, a secretary, and architect [[Francis Ferdinand Durang, Jr.]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/34/Christopher-Durang.html|title=Christopher Durang Biography (1949-)|website=FilmReference.com|access-date=November 19, 2018}}</ref> He grew up in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey. He attended [[Catholic school]]s as a child, including the Our Lady of Peace School in [[New Providence, New Jersey|New Providence]] and [[Delbarton School]] in [[Morristown, New Jersey|Morristown]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Dunlap, LucyAnn|url=https://princetoninfo.com/a-play-that-asks-what-happens-after/|title=A Play That Asks, 'What Happens After?'|work=[[U.S. 1 (newspaper)|U.S. 1 Newspaper]]|date=August 17, 2005|access-date=November 19, 2018|quote=He wrote his first play at age eight.

He lives in [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania]], with his husband, actor and playwright John Augustine. They have been together since 1986<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/26/theater/newsandfeatures/christopher-durang-explores-the-afterlife-including-his-own.html|title=Christopher Durang Explores the Afterlife, Including His Own|author=Dinitia Smith|author-link=Dinitia Smith|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 26, 2005|access-date=November 19, 2018}}</ref> and were legally married in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Naila|first=Francis|date=2014-07-17|title=Erwinna playwright Durang takes the stage in his Tony-winning play|url=https://www.burlingtoncountytimes.com/article/20140717/LIFESTYLE/307179664|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210620015757/https://www.burlingtoncountytimes.com/article/20140717/LIFESTYLE/307179664|archive-date=2021-06-20|access-date=2021-06-20|website=[[Burlington County Times]]|language=en}}</ref>

==Work==
His work often deals critically with issues of [[child abuse]], [[Roman Catholic]] [[dogma]], culture, and [[homosexuality]]. Ben Brantley summarized key themes from Durang's plays in a review written in 1994: 1) narcissism; 2) fear or engagement with a danger-filled world; 3) the strangulating nature of family ties; 4) sexual disorientation and the tenuousness of individual identity;<ref>{{Cite news|last=Brantley|first=Ben|date=November 14, 1994|title=Durang Durang: Plays That Cast as Irreverent Eye Over Two Revered Playwrights.|work=New York Times}}</ref> to this list the abusive power of authority figures could be added.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Chirico|first=Miriam|title=The Theatre of Christopher Durang|publisher=Methuen Drama|year=2020|pages=12–13}}</ref>  While Durang's use of parody and his criticism of many social institutions might appear overly cynical at times, he states: 
<blockquote>...when I say everyone is crazy that means it's a very bad day where the amount of crazy people in the world has spread out to the entire universe and it doesn't seem possible to cope with anything... I think we're all neurotic. And I do think relationships are certainly difficult. Nonetheless, those lines in the play do get a laugh, so there's something. It’s not as despairing as it sounds, but I don't not believe it.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Gholson, Craig|title=Theater: Interview — Christopher Durang|journal=[[BOMB Magazine]]|volume=20|date=Summer 1987}}</ref></blockquote>

Much of Durang's style can be attributed to the aesthetic of black comedy, a humor style that offers a fatalistic view of life. Durang discusses the particular frame of mind that requires the viewer to distance himself from the horrific episode of human suffering and pain; he explains:<blockquote>I exaggerate awful things further, and then I present it in a way that is funny, and for those of us who find it funny, it has to do with a very clear suspension of disbelief. It is a play, after all, with acted characters; it allows us a distance we couldn’t have in reality.  To me this distance allows me to find some rather serious topics funny.</blockquote>Durang suggests that his form of humor requires a double-consciousness, an ability to register scenes of cruelty or pain, while simultaneously comprehending the humor.  He credits Arthur Kopit's “tragicfarce” ''Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mom’s Hung You in the Closet and I’m Feelin’ So Sad'' as an early influence on his creative vision, a black comedy in which a woman totes her dead husband's corpse on vacation with her.  Humor is one way of resolving conflict and anxiety, and black comedy goes a step further to relieve tension regarding subjects that are typically difficult to think about, such as death, family dysfunction, or torture.<ref name=":0" />

His plays have been performed nationwide, including on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and [[Off-Broadway]].<ref name="ibdb">{{cite web|url=https://www.ibdb.com/person.php?id=4832|title=Christopher Durang|publisher=Internet Broadway Database|access-date=November 19, 2018}}</ref> His works include those in the bibliography as well as a collection of one-act parodies meant to be performed in one evening entitled ''[[Durang/Durang]]'' that includes "Mrs. Sorken", "For Whom The Southern Belle Tolls" (a parody of ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]'' by [[Tennessee Williams]]), "A Stye of the Eye", "Nina in the Morning", "Wanda's Visit", and "Business Lunch at the Russian Tea Room".

Together with Marsha Norman, Durang directed The Lila Acheson Wallace American Playwrights Program at the [[Juilliard School]] from 1984 to 2016, teaching playwrights Joshua Harmon and Noah Haidle, as well as Pulitzer-Prize winning David Lindsay-Abaire, who succeeded Durang as co-director.

Durang has performed as an actor for both stage and screen. He first came to prominence in his [[Off-Broadway]] satirical review ''Das Lusitania Songspiel'', which he performed with friend and fellow Yale alum [[Sigourney Weaver]]. Later he co-starred in one of his own plays as Matt in ''The Marriage of Bette and Boo'', as well as Man in the original production of ''Laughing Wild''.
He is currently working on a new play, '' Turning Off The Morning News '', being produced at the [[McCarter Theater]] in Princeton, NJ.

===In film===
Durang has denounced the [[Robert Altman]] 1987 [[Beyond Therapy (film)|film adaptation]] of ''[[Beyond Therapy]]'', calling it "horrific." He accused Altman of totally rewriting the script "so that all psychology is thrown out the window, and the characters dash around acting crazy but with literally no behavioral logic underneath."<ref>Durang, Christopher (1995).
