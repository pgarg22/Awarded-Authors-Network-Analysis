'''Guillaume Apollinaire''' ({{IPA-fr|ɡijom apɔlinɛʁ|lang}}; 26 August 1880 – 9 November 1918) (born as  ''Wilhelm Albert Włodzimierz Apolinary de Wąż-Kostrowicki'') was a French [[French poetry|poet]], playwright, [[short story writer]], novelist, and [[art critic]] of Polish-Belarusian descent.

Apollinaire is considered one of the foremost poets of the early 20th century, as well as one of the most impassioned defenders of [[Cubism]] and a forefather of [[Surrealism]]. He is credited with coining the term "Cubism"<ref name="Daniel Robbins">[https://archive.org/stream/albertgleizes1881robb#page/n3/mode/2up Daniel Robbins, 1964, ''Albert Gleizes 1881 – 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition'', Published by The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, in collaboration with Musée National d'Art Moderne, Paris, Museum am Ostwall, Dortmund]</ref> in 1911 to describe the emerging [[art movement]], the term [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]] in 1912, and the term "Surrealism" in 1917 to describe the works of [[Erik Satie]]. He wrote poems without punctuation attempting to be resolutely modern in both form and subject.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Oxford illustrated encyclopedia|date=1985–1993|publisher=Oxford University Press |editor=Judge, Harry George |editor2=Toyne, Anthony |isbn=0-19-869129-7 |page=18 |oclc=11814265}}</ref>  Apollinaire wrote one of the earliest Surrealist literary works, the play ''[[The Breasts of Tiresias]]'' (1917), which became the basis for [[Francis Poulenc]]'s 1947 opera ''[[Les mamelles de Tirésias]]''.

Influenced by Symbolist poetry in his youth, he was admired during his lifetime by the young poets who later formed the nucleus of the Surrealist group ([[André Breton|Breton]], [[Louis Aragon|Aragon]], [[Philippe Soupault|Soupault]]). He revealed very early on an originality that freed him from any school of influence and made him one of the precursors of the literary revolution of the first half of the 20th century. His art is not based on any theory, but on a simple principle: the act of creating must come from the imagination, from intuition, because it must be as close as possible to life, to nature, to the environment, and to the human being.

Apollinaire was also active as a journalist and art critic for ''[[Le Matin (France)|Le Matin]]'', ''[[L'Intransigeant]]'', ''L'Esprit nouveau'', ''[[Mercure de France]]'', and ''Paris Journal''. In 1912 Apollinaire cofounded ''[[Les Soirées de Paris]]'', an artistic and literary magazine.

Two years after being wounded in [[World War I]], Apollinaire died during the [[Spanish flu]] pandemic of 1918 and was declared "Dead for France" (''Mort pour la France'') because of his commitment during the war.<ref name="Moore">[http://www.wiu.edu/Apollinaire/Biographie.htm Catherine Moore, Mark Moore, Guillaume Apollinaire official website, Biographie: Chronologie], Western Illinois University</ref>

Wilhelm Albert Włodzimierz Apolinary Kostrowicki was born in Rome, Italy, and was raised speaking French, Italian, and [[Polish language|Polish]].<ref name="starosti1">{{cite web|url=http://starosti.ru/address_article.php?address=11gio |title=Газетные "старости" (Архив) |publisher=Starosti.ru |date=9 January 1907 |access-date=6 December 2011}}</ref> He emigrated to France in his late teens and adopted the name Guillaume Apollinaire.  His mother, born Angelika Kostrowicka, was a Polish noblewoman born near [[Navahrudak]], [[Grodno Governorate]] (present-day [[Belarus]]). His maternal grandfather was a general in the [[Imperial Russia|Russian Imperial Army]] who was killed in the [[Crimean War]].  Apollinaire's father is unknown but may have been Francesco Costantino Camillo Flugi d'Aspermont (born 1835), a [[Graubünden]] aristocrat who disappeared early from Apollinaire's life.  Francesco Flugi von Aspermont was a nephew of Conradin Flugi d'Aspermont (1787–1874), a poet who wrote in ladin putèr (an official language dialect of Switzerland spoken in Engiadina ota), and perhaps also of the Minnesänger Oswald von Wolkenstein (born c. 1377, died 2 August 1445; see ''Les ancêtres Grisons du poète Guillaume Apollinaire'' at Généanet).

===Paris===
Apollinaire eventually moved from Rome to Paris in 1900<ref name="Baxter2009">{{cite book|author=John Baxter|title=Carnal Knowledge: Baxter's Concise Encyclopedia of Modern Sex|url=https://archive.org/details/carnalknowledgeb00baxt|url-access=registration|access-date=24 December 2011|date=10 February 2009|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-087434-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/carnalknowledgeb00baxt/page/13 13]}}</ref> and became one of the most popular members of the artistic community of Paris (both in [[Montmartre]] and [[Montparnasse]]).  His friends and collaborators in that period included [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henri Rousseau]], [[Gertrude Stein]], [[Max Jacob]], [[André Salmon]], [[André Breton]], [[André Derain]], [[Faik Konitza]], [[Blaise Cendrars]], [[Giuseppe Ungaretti]], [[Pierre Reverdy]], [[Alexandra Exter]], [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Erik Satie]], [[Ossip Zadkine]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] and [[Jean Metzinger]].  He became romantically involved with [[Marie Laurencin]], who is often identified as his muse. While there, he dabbled in [[anarchism]] and spoke out as a [[Dreyfus Affair|Dreyfusard]] in defense of Dreyfus's innocence.<ref name="Schumaher">[https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1349173282 Claude Schumacher, ''Alfred Jarry and Guillaume Apollinaire''], Modern Dramatists, Macmillan International Higher Education, 1984, pp. 4, 14, 23, 148, 168, {{ISBN|1349173282}}</ref>

Metzinger painted the first Cubist portrait of Apollinaire. In his ''Vie anecdotique'' (16 October 1911), the poet proudly writes: "I am honoured to be the first model of a Cubist painter, Jean Metzinger, for a portrait exhibited in 1910 at the Salon des Indépendants." It was not only the first Cubist portrait, according to Apollinaire, but it was also the first great portrait of the poet exhibited in public, prior to others by [[Louis Marcoussis]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Mikhail Larionov]] and Picasso.<ref>Jean Metzinger, 1910, [http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/jean-metzinger-portrait-de-guillaume-apollin-4911615-details.aspx?from=searchresults&intObjectID=4911615&sid=bf281115-cf70-463b-ad5c-c027467afb4c Portrait of Guillaume Apollinaire], Christie's Paris, 2007.</ref>

In 1911 he joined the Puteaux Group, a branch of the Cubist movement soon to be known as the [[Section d'Or]].  The opening address of the 1912 Salon de la Section d'Or—the most important pre-World War I Cubist exhibition—was given by Apollinaire.<ref name="La Section d'Or">[http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_s8JyxbYrSG0/TJZ4b_6VYNI/AAAAAAAABfo/5RCFXVta2yk/s1600/La+Section+d%27Or+numéro+spécial+9+octobre+1912+couv.jpg La Section d'Or], Numéro spécial, 9 Octobre 1912.</ref><ref name="The History and Chronology of Cubism">[http://www.serdar-hizli-art.com/art_history/abstract_art/history_and_chronology_of_cubism_page_5.htm The History and Chronology of Cubism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130314010756/http://www.serdar-hizli-art.com/art_history/abstract_art/history_and_chronology_of_cubism_page_5.htm |date=14 March 2013 }}, p. 5.</ref>

On 7 September 1911, police arrested and jailed him on suspicion of aiding and abetting the theft of the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' and a number of Egyptian statuettes from the [[Louvre]],<ref name="starosti1"/><ref>[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k564088b/f1.image "Un homme de lettres connu est arrêté comme recéleur"], ''Le Petit Parisien'', 9 September 1911 (in French).</ref> but released him a week later.

===Cubism===

Apollinaire wrote the preface for the first Cubist exposition outside of Paris; ''VIII Salon des Indépendants'', Brussels, 1911.<ref>[https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/efts/ARTFL/databases/bibliopolis/art/art.bib.html Préface, in Catalogue du 8<sup>e</sup> Salon annuel du Cercle d'art Les Indépendants], Musée moderne de Bruxelles, 10 June – 3 July 1911.</ref> In an open-handed preface to the catalogue of the Brussels Indépendants show, Apollinaire stated that these 'new painters' accepted the name of Cubists which has been given to them. He described Cubism as a new manifestation and high art [''manifestation nouvelle et très élevée de l'art''], not a system that constrains talent [''non-point un système contraignant les talents''], and the differences which characterize not only the talents but even the styles of these artists are an obvious proof of this.<ref name="Cooper">Douglas Cooper, 1971, [https://archive.org/details/cubistepoch00coop Douglas Cooper, ''The Cubist Epoch''], Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, N.Y., 1970, p. 97</ref><ref>Françoise Roberts-Jones, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fXjRc4yYNukC&pg=PA76&lpg=PA76&dq=%22manifestation+nouvelle+et++très+élevée+de+l'art,+mais+non+point+un+système+contraignant+les+talents%22&source=bl&ots=BJdY4mogXm&sig=Ngwbhu3RL_NuuX3M0BBZYqqS8C4&hl=en#v=onepage&q=%22manifestation%20nouvelle%20et%20%20très%20élevée%20de%20l'art%2C%20mais%20non%20point%20un%20système%20contraignant%20les%20talents%22&f=false Chronique d'un musée: Musée royal des beaux-arts de Belgique], Bruxelles.</ref> The artists involved with this new movement, according to Apollinaire, included [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Georges Braque]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Fernand Léger]], and [[Henri Le Fauconnier]].<ref name="Robbins, 1985">Daniel Robbins, 1985, ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism'', University of Iowa Museum of Art, Iowa City, J.

===Orphism===
The term [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]] was coined by Apollinaire at the Salon de la [[Section d'Or]] in 1912, referring to the works of [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[František Kupka]]. During his lecture at the Section d'Or exhibit Apollinaire presented three of Kupka's abstract works as perfect examples of ''pure painting'', as anti-figurative as music.<ref name="Peter Read" />

In ''[[The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations|Les Peintres Cubistes, Méditations Esthétiques]]'' (1913) Apollinaire described Orphism as "the art of painting new totalities with elements that the artist does not take from visual reality, but creates entirely by himself. [...] An Orphic painter's works should convey an ''untroubled [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] pleasure'', but at the same time a ''meaningful structure and sublime significance''. According to Apollinaire Orphism represented a move towards a completely new art-form, much as music was to literature.<ref name="MoMA">Hajo Düchting, [http://www.moma.org/collection/theme.php?theme_id=10142 ''Orphism''], MoMA, From Grove Art Online, 2009 Oxford University Press.</ref>

===Surrealism===
The term Surrealism was first used by Apollinaire concerning the ballet ''[[Parade (ballet)|Parade]]'' in 1917. The poet [[Arthur Rimbaud]] wanted to be a visionary, to perceive the hidden side of things within the realm of another reality. In continuity with Rimbaud, Apollinaire went in search of a hidden and mysterious reality. The term "surrealism" appeared for the first time in March 1917 (Chronologie de Dada et du surréalisme, 1917) in a letter by Apollinaire to [[Paul Dermée]]: "All things considered, I think in fact it is better to adopt surrealism than supernaturalism, which I first used" [''Tout bien examiné, je crois en effet qu'il vaut mieux adopter surréalisme que surnaturalisme que j'avais d'abord employé''].<ref>Jean-Paul Clébert, ''Dictionnaire du surréalisme'', A.T.P. & Le Seuil, Chamalières, p. 17, 1996.</ref>

He described ''Parade'' as "a kind of surrealism" (''une sorte de surréalisme'') when he wrote the program note the following week, thus coining the word three years before Surrealism emerged as an art movement in Paris.<ref>Hargrove, Nancy (1998). "The Great Parade: Cocteau, Picasso, Satie, Massine, Diaghilev—and T.S. Eliot". Journal for the Interdisciplinary Study of Literature 31 (1)</ref>

===World War I and death===
Apollinaire served as an infantry officer in [[World War I]] and, in 1916, received a serious shrapnel wound to the temple, from which he would never fully recover.<ref name="Baxter2009"/> He wrote ''[[The Breasts of Tiresias|Les Mamelles de Tirésias]]'' while recovering from this wound. During this period he coined the word "[[Surrealism]]" in the programme notes for [[Jean Cocteau]]'s and [[Erik Satie]]'s ballet ''[[Parade (ballet)|Parade]]'', first performed on 18 May 1917. He also published an artistic manifesto, ''L'Esprit nouveau et les poètes''. Apollinaire's status as a literary critic is most famous and influential in his recognition of the [[Marquis de Sade]], whose works were for a long time obscure, yet arising in popularity as an influence upon the [[Dadaism|Dada]] and Surrealist art movements going on in Montparnasse at the beginning of the twentieth century as, "The freest spirit that ever existed."

The war-weakened Apollinaire died at the age of 38 on 9 November 1918 of [[influenza]] during the [[Spanish flu]] pandemic of 1918 ravaging Europe at the time, two years after being wounded in [[World War I]].<ref name="Baxter2009" /> Due to his military service for the duration of the war, he was declared "Dead for France" (''Mort pour la France'') by the French government.<ref name="Moore" /> He was interred in the [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]], Paris.

==Works==
In 1900 he wrote his first novel ''Mirely, ou le petit trou pas cher'' (pornographic), which was eventually lost.<ref name="Baxter2009"/> Apollinaire's first collection of poetry was ''L'enchanteur pourrissant'' (1909), but ''[[Alcools]]'' (1913) established his reputation. The poems, influenced in part by the [[symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]]s, juxtapose the old and the new, combining traditional poetic forms with modern imagery. In 1913, Apollinaire published the essay ''[[The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations|Les Peintres Cubistes, Méditations Esthétiques]]'' on the [[Cubist]] painters, a movement which he helped to define. He also coined the term ''[[Orphism (art)|orphism]]'' to describe a tendency towards absolute abstraction in the paintings of [[Robert Delaunay]] and others.

In 1907 Apollinaire published the well-known [[erotic novel]], ''[[The Eleven Thousand Rods]]'' (''Les Onze Mille Verges'').<ref>Patrick J. Kearney, ''A History of Erotic Literature'', 1982, pp. 163–164</ref><ref>Karín Lesnik-Oberstein, ''The last taboo: women and body hair'', [[Manchester University Press]], 2006, {{ISBN|0-7190-7500-9}}, p.94</ref> Officially banned in France until 1970, various printings of it circulated widely for many years. Apollinaire never publicly acknowledged authorship of the novel. Another erotic novel attributed to him was ''The Exploits of a Young [[Don Juan]] (Les exploits d'un jeune Don Juan)'', in which the 15-year-old hero fathers three children with various members of his entourage, including his aunt.<ref>Neil Cornwell, ''The Absurd in Literature'', [[Manchester University Press]], 2006, {{ISBN|0-7190-7410-X}}, pp.86–87</ref><ref>Roger Shattuck, ''The Banquet Years: the arts in France, 1885–1918: Alfred Jarry, Henri Rousseau, Erik Satie, Guillaume Apollinaire'', [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], 1961, p. 268.</ref> Apollinaire's gift to Picasso of the original 1907 manuscript was one of the artist's most prized possessions.<ref>{{cite book|first=John |last=Golding| title=Visions of the Modern|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_d5wXeMFxA2IC | year=1994 |page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_d5wXeMFxA2IC/page/n106 109]| isbn=0520087925}}</ref> The book was made into a [[Exploits of a Young Don Juan|movie in 1987]].

Shortly after his death, Mercure de France published ''[[Calligrammes]]'', a collection of his [[concrete poetry]] (poetry in which typography and layout adds to the overall effect), and more orthodox, though still modernist poems informed by Apollinaire's experiences in the First World War and in which he often used the technique of automatic writing.

In his youth Apollinaire lived for a short while in [[Belgium]], mastering the [[Walloon language|Walloon]] dialect sufficiently to write poetry, some of which has survived.
