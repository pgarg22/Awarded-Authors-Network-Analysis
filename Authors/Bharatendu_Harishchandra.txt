'''Bharatendu Harishchandra''' (9 September 1850{{spaced ndash}}6 January 1885) was an Indian poet, writer and playwright. He was an author of several dramas, life sketches and travel accounts; he used new media such as reports, publications, letters to the editor, translations, and literary works to shape public opinion.<ref>Vasudha Dalmia, ''Poetics, Plays and Performances: The Politics of Modern Indian Theatre,'' New Delhi, Oxford University Press (2006)  {{ISBN|0-19-567473-1}}</ref><ref name="MetcalfMetcalf2002" />

Writing under the [[pen name]] "Rasa", Harishchandra represented the agonies of the people, the country's poverty, dependency, inhuman exploitation, the unrest of the middle class and the urge for the progress of the country. He was an influential [[Hindu]] "traditionalist", using [[Vaishnava]] devotionalism to define a coherent Hindu religion.<ref name="MetcalfMetcalf2002" />

Bharatendu Harishchandra is often considered the father of [[Hindi literature]] and [[Hindi theatre]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Diana Dimitrova|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FA9qAKpUtTIC&q=Hindi+theatre|title=Western tradition and naturalistic Hindi theatre|publisher=Peter Lang|year=2004|isbn=0-8204-6822-3|page=14|ref=Dm}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Sandria B.

== Biography ==
Born into the [[Agrawal]] caste in [[Banaras]], Bharatendu Harishchandra's father Gopal Chandra was a poet. His ancestors were landlords in Bengal.<ref name="Awadesh Pradhan 2009" /> His parents died when he was young but they seem to have had an influence on him. [[Acharya Shukla|Acharya Ramchandra Shukla]] has described how Bharatendu went to the [[Jagannath Temple (Puri)|Jagannath temple]] in Puri, Orissa with his family in 1865, when he was merely 15 years of age.<ref>Ramchandra Shukla, ''Hindi Sahitya ka Itihaas (History of Hindi Literature)'', 1928.</ref> During this trip he was influenced by the [[Bengal Renaissance]] and decided to bring the genres of social, historical, and [[Puranas|Puranic]] plays and novels into Hindi. This influence reflected in his Hindi translation of the Bengali drama ''[[Ramprasad Sen|Vidyasundar]],'' three years later, in 1868.

Harishchandra edited the magazines ''Kavi Vachan Sudha'', ''Harishchandra Magazine'', ''Harishchandra Patrika'' and ''Bal Vodhini.''<ref>{{cite book|author=Vasudha Dalmia|title=The nationalization of Hindu traditions : Bharatendu Harischandra and nineteenth-century Banaras|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1997|isbn=0-19-563961-8|location=Delhi; New York}}</ref>

He wrote under the pseudonym Girdhar Das. He was titled "Bharatendu" ("The moon of India") at a public meeting by scholars of [[Banaras|Kashi]] in 1880 in recognition of his services as a writer, patron, and moderniser. [[Ram Vilas Sharma]] refers to the "great literary awakening ushered in under Bharatendu's leadership" as the "second storey of the edifice of renascent Hindi", the first being the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]].<ref name="Awadesh Pradhan 2009">Awadesh Pradhan, ''The Spiritual and Cultural Ethos of Modern Hindi Literature'', Prabuddha Bharata, July 2009.</ref>

He was married and had one daughter.

== Hindu traditionalism ==
According to [[Barbara Metcalf|Barbara]] and [[Thomas R. Metcalf]], Bharatendu Harishchandra is considered an influential example of Hindu "traditionalist" in north India, typifying continuity with received tradition and self-conscious participation with the modern world. He was typical of those Indians who engaged with Western institutions and learning. He used new media, especially publications to shape public opinion. Harishchandra was also typical of revivalists of Hindi literature which were closely connected with Hindu revivalist movements. He "combined pleas for [the] use of [[Swadeshi]] articles with [[Hindi–Urdu controversy#Hindi and Urdu movements|demands for replacement of Urdu by Hindi]] in courts and a ban on [[cow slaughter]]".<ref name="Sarkar1983">{{cite book|author=Sumit Sarkar|title=Modern India, 1885–1947|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x1uBQgAACAAJ|date=1 January 1983|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-333-90425-1|page=70}}</ref> He used [[Vaishnava]] devotionalism to define a coherent [[Hindu]] religion, with a base in the Kashi Dharma Sabha, started in the 1860s by the [[Narayan dynasty#Rajas of Benares: .281770.E2.80.931939.29|Maharaja of Benares]] as a response to more radical Hindu reformist movements.

He also went to [[Delhi Durbar]] on behalf of [[Narayan dynasty|Maharaja of Benares]] asking for a legal ban on cow slaughter. He also drew a petition on the same later and according to Sahay ([1905] 1975: 84) had 60,000 signatories and was submitted to Lord lytton but no action was taken however this proved to be of lasting significance and he was given the title "Vir Vaishnava"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Dalmia|first=Vashudha|title=Bharatendu Harischandra And Nineteenth Century|year=1997|location=New Delhi|pages=370}}</ref>  

Harishchandra insisted on the value of image worship and interpreted [[Bhakti]] as devotion to a single god; this was in response to Orientalist and Christian critiques of Hinduism.<ref name="MetcalfMetcalf2002">{{cite book|author1=Barbara D. Metcalf|author2=Thomas R.

{{quote|
निज भाषा उन्नति अहै, सब उन्नति को मूल ।<br>
बिन निज भाषा-ज्ञान के, मिटत न हिय को सूल ।।

विविध कला शिक्षा अमित, ज्ञान अनेक प्रकार।<br>
सब देसन से लै करहू, भाषा माहि प्रचार ।।

Translation:<br>
Progress is made in one's own language (the mother tongue), as it the foundation of all progress.<br>
Without the knowledge of the mother tongue, there is no cure for the pain of heart.
Many arts and education infinite, knowledge of various kinds.<br> Should be taken from all countries, but be propagated in one's mother tongue.}}
