==Career==
His uncle was the famed meteorologist [[Sakuhei Fujiwara]] and his son is mathematician [[Masahiko Fujiwara]]. After retiring from the [[Japan Meteorological Agency]], he began writing professionally. Originally a [[meteorologist]], he wrote mainly on themes connected with mountains.

At least three of his documentary novels have been translated into English. {{Nihongo|''Death March on Mount Hakkōda''|八甲田山死の彷徨|Hakkōdasan shi no hōkō}} is based on [[Hakkōda Mountains incident|an incident in 1902]] in the [[Hakkōda Mountains]]. {{Nihongo|''Alaskan Tale''|アラスカ物語|Arasuka monogatari}} is about the adventures of Frank Yasuda.

{{Nihongo|''Phantom Immigrants''|密航船水安丸|Mikōsen Suianmaru|lit. "Stowaway-ship Suianmaru"; translated by David Sulz}} deals with the [[Meiji era]] entrepreneur, {{Nihongo|Jinzaburo Oikawa|及川 甚三郎|Oikawa Jinzaburō}} from northern [[Miyagi prefecture]], who went to Canada in 1896 to export [[salmon roe]] back to Japan. In 1906, he chartered the schooner ''Suianmaru'' to smuggle 82 fellow villagers out of Japan and into Canada. They were apprehended and arrested on [[Vancouver Island]] without passports but allowed to stay in Canada thanks to negotiations by {{Nihongo|Saburo Yoshie|吉江 三郎|Yoshie Saburō}} (aka Fred Yoshy) of the Japanese [[consulate]] in Vancouver.

His 1973 two-volume novel {{Nihongo|''Kokou no Hito''|孤高の人}} has been adapted into a manga series of the [[Kokou no Hito|same title]] in which he is credited as writer.
