== Work ==

=== Literary career ===

Imam's first book, ''Paravarti Drishya'' (Bengali: ''পরবর্তী দৃশ্য'': 1996) was a play in Bengali. It was published by [[Bangla Academy]] in Dhaka under its Young Writers Project programme. It was followed by 2 novellas,'' Elephant Road'' (Bengali: ''এলিফ্যান্ট রোড'': 1997) and ''Boidik'' (Bengali: ''বৈদিক'': 1999). Both ''Elephant Road'' and ''Boidik'', and his one-act play ''Nispriho Nishshoron'' (Bengali: ''নিস্পৃহ নিঃসরণ'': 1993), were first published in ''Uttaradhiker'' (Bengali: ''উত্তরাধিকার''), the Bangla Academy journal for creative writing. 11 years after the publication of ''Boidik'', Adorsho Publishers in Dhaka published his first poetry collection ''Amaar Rashtro Amaar Nagorik'' (Bengali: ''আমার রাষ্ট্র আমার নাগরিক'': 2010).  Imam also adapted 2 British plays for Bangladesh Television ([[Edward Bond]]'s ''Stone'' [''পাথর''] and [[John Osborne]]'s ''[[Look Back in Anger]]'' [''ক্ষোভ'']), which were starred by such popular actors as [[Enamul Haque (actor)|Enamul Haque]], [[Lucky Enam]], Shirin Bokul and Zamal Uddin Hussain and produced by BTV Director Faridur Rahman.

=== ''The Black Coat'' ===

Imam's first book in English, ''[[The Black Coat]]'', which is also his first novel, was published by Penguin Books India in 2013. A historical novel, it is based on Prime Minister [[Sheikh Mujib]]'s rule of [[Bangladesh]] from 1972 to mid-1975 when he was killed in a military coup. Sheikh Mujib is commonly regarded as Father of the Bengali Nation, but Imam depicts him as the country's first and the deadliest dictator. Imam condemns Bengali nationalists, followers of Mujib, and workers of his party, [[Bangladesh Awami League]], for distorting history to protect Mujib's legacy as a ruler from the attention of the new generation of Bangladesh. He criticises the Sheikh Mujib administration for letting one and a half million people starve to death during and after the [[Bangladesh famine of 1974]], which is at the heart of the story of ''The Black Coat''.

=== Reception ===

In the first major book review for ''Outlook India'', Indian author Indrajit Hazra called ''The Black Coat'' "an extraordinary book ... a fine work of fiction." In his review, entitled "Father And Sons, Or The Lie of the Land," Hazra added, "Very few novels examine a period in history so convincingly even as it turns away from the standard style of historical fiction. Imam does this in this hyper-realistic tale of fools, thugs, dangerous idealism and sanctified pretence, reminding us who have forgotten a secret function of the novel: to unsettle us, instead of just be moving."<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Hazra |first=Indrajit |date=3 June 2013 |title=Father And Sons, Or The Lie Of The Land |url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?285600 |magazine=Outlook}}</ref>

''Mint'', India's business newspaper, called the book "a powerful fictional revisiting of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s troubled legacy in Bangladesh." Reviewer Arunava Sinha went on to say, "Rich with political statements, this is a novel that achieves its intent in a remarkably creative and artistic manner."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sinha |first1=Arunava |title=Book Review: The Black Coat |url=http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/FHtvgL2Wgjnm0wjUvsEjCK/Book-Review--The-Black-Coat.html |website=www.livemint.com |language=en |date=8 June 2013}}</ref>

It was also reviewed by ''Deccan Herald'', ''Financial Express'', ''Daily Star'', ''Asian Review of Books'', ''Sunday Guardian'', ''Business Standard'' and ''Mail Today''. All the journals hugely praised the novel. ''Asian Review of Books'' wrote: “Neamat Imam’s first novel, ''The Black Coat'', is pure satire, written with such disarming earnestness that one might neglect to shake it down and dissect its numerous layers.”<ref>{{cite web |title=Asian Review of Books |url=http://www.asianreviewofbooks.com/new/?ID=1503#! |website=www.asianreviewofbooks.com}}</ref> ''Financial Express'' commented that it was "one of the best (novels) to come out of the subcontinent in the recent past.”<ref>Reality or Fiction? http://www.financialexpress.com/news/reality-or-fiction-/1144501</ref>

The book has also been criticised. In a major article in Bangla entitled "Blackmailing the Black Coat?", Imam was accused of stigmatising the name of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.[15] With this book Imam was conspiring to slay Sheikh Mujib once again, the review said. It believed that while elements of Bangladesh politics that are against the country's independence would use the book in their propaganda against Sheikh Mujib and the Awami League, those who support the liberation of the country would read it only to understand how ungrateful a Bengali writer could be to his nation. The article concluded that Imam didn't have any respect for Bangladesh's war of independence and its countless freedom fighters.
