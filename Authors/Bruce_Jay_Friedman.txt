'''Bruce Jay Friedman''' (April 26, 1930{{spnd}}June 3, 2020) was an American novelist, screenwriter, playwright, and actor. He was noted for his versatility of writing in both literature and pop culture.  He was also a trailblazer in the style of modern American [[Black comedy|black humor]].  The themes he wrote about reflected the major changes taking place in society during the 1960s and 1970s.  Many of his stories were inspired by the events of his personal life.

==Early life==
Friedman was born in [[New York City]] on April 26, 1930, and was raised in [[The Bronx]], together with his sister, Dollie.  His father, Irving, worked at a company selling women's apparel; his mother, Mollie (Liebowitz), was a regular theatergoer.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news|title=Bruce Jay Friedman, 90, Author With a Darkly Comic Worldview, Dies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/books/bruce-jay-friedman-90-author-with-a-darkly-comic-worldview-dies.html|first=Bruce|last=Weber|date=June 3, 2020|access-date=June 3, 2020|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>  His family was Jewish.<ref name=NYT/><ref name=TaubShatzky>{{cite book |last1=Taub|first1=Michael|last2=Shatzky|first2=Joel|title=Contemporary Jewish-American Novelists: A Bio-critical Sourcebook| url=https://archive.org/details/contemporaryjewi0000shat|url-access=registration|quote=Friedman.| year=1997| publisher=Greenwood|pages=[https://archive.org/details/contemporaryjewi0000shat/page/92 92]–96|isbn=978-0313294624}}</ref>  Friedman attended [[DeWitt Clinton High School]] before studying journalism at the [[University of Missouri]],<ref>Greenfield, Josh.

He subsequently joined the [[United States Air Force]] and wrote for the military publication ''Air Training''.<ref name=NYT/>  One of his commanding officers there made him a gift of ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'', ''[[Of Time and the River]]'', and ''[[From Here to Eternity (novel)|From Here to Eternity]]''.  After reading the books in approximately a single weekend, it spurred him on to become a writer.<ref name=AP>{{cite news|title='Splash,' 'Stern' writer Bruce Jay Friedman dead at 90|url=https://apnews.com/007e354f10b93b4aeb787000fa509fc1|first=Hillel|last=Italie|date=June 3, 2020|access-date=June 4, 2020|work=Associated Press}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Bruce Jay Friedman Dies: Oscar-Nominated Screenplay Writer, Author And Playwright Was 90|url=https://deadline.com/2020/06/bruce-jay-friedman-dies-oscar-nominated-writer-was-90-obituary-1202950788/|first=Bruce|last=Haring|date=June 3, 2020|access-date=June 6, 2020|magazine=Deadline}}</ref>

==Career==
After he finished his two-year stint in the military, Friedman went back to The Bronx.  He wrote his first short story titled "Wonderful Golden Rule Days", which he sold to ''[[The New Yorker]]''. He was later employed by [[Magazine Management Company]] in 1954, working for many of the era's famous [[List of men's magazines|men's magazines]].  Friedman ended up as an executive editor in charge of the magazines ''Men'' (not the [[Men (magazine)|present magazine]] of the same title), ''Male'', and ''Man's World''.<ref name=NYT/>

Friedman published ''Stern'', the first of his eight novels, in 1962.  This was followed shortly by ''A Mother’s Kisses'' (1964) and his first play, ''[[Scuba Duba]]'' (1967).  The success of these three works led to his being named "The Hottest Writer of the Year" by ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' in 1968.  He switched his focus to writing screenplays after the 1970s.  He wrote the script for ''[[Stir Crazy (film)|Stir Crazy]]'' in 1980, which wound up being the third-highest-grossing film in the U.S. that year.  Four years later, he composed the first draft of ''[[Splash (film)|Splash]]''.<ref name=NYT/>  It received an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]],<ref name=Schudel>{{cite news|title=Bruce Jay Friedman, novelist, playwright with an edge of 'black humor,' dies at 90|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/bruce-jay-friedman-novelist-playwright-with-an-edge-of-black-humor-dies-at-90/2020/06/04/bffd12c2-a667-11ea-bb20-ebf0921f3bbd_story.html|first=Matt|last=Schudel|date=June 4, 2020|access-date=June 6, 2020|newspaper=The Washington Post}}</ref> which Friedman shared with [[Brian Grazer]], [[Lowell Ganz]], and [[Babaloo Mandel]].<ref name=NYT/>

Friedman wrote several novels throughout the 1980s and 1990s that garnered "respectful reviews".<ref name=NYT/>  However, critics were of the opinion that they lacked the same level of inventiveness as his previous works.  In 1988, he appeared in [[Woody Allen]]'s film ''[[Another Woman]]''.  He would go on to feature in two other films directed by Allen during the following decade: ''[[Husbands and Wives]]'' (1992) and ''[[Celebrity (1998 film)|Celebrity]]'' (1998).<ref name=NYT/>  Friedman's collection of short fiction, ''Three Balconies'', appeared in September 2008, from Biblioasis, who also published his 2011 memoir ''Lucky Bruce''.<ref>"Biblioasis site for Lucky Bruce" {{cite web |url=http://www.biblioasis.com/bruce-jay-friedman/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=November 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016093933/http://www.biblioasis.com/bruce-jay-friedman |archive-date=October 16, 2011 }} Accessed November 5, 2011.</ref> A collection of four plays (''Scuba Duba'', ''Steambath'', ''Sardines'' and ''The Trial''{{--)}}, titled ''3.1 Plays'', was published in January 2012.<ref>"Leaping Lion Books Blog" [http://leapinglionbooks.wordpress.com/] Accessed November 5, 2011.</ref>

===Style===
Friedman was an early writer of modern American [[Black comedy|black humor]], together with his peers [[Joseph Heller]] (also a close friend of his), [[Stanley Elkin]], and [[Thomas Pynchon]].  The style was given this name in part because of the 1965 anthology by the same name that he edited.  When asked about the origin of the term by ''[[Newsday]]'' in 1995, he revealed, "I don’t really know if I invented [it]".<ref name=Schudel/>  He was described by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as a "deadpan prose stylist" who was a "savage social satirist".<ref name=NYT/>  The themes of his writings reflected the social cataclysm that took place during the 1960s and 1970s.  He utilized his experiences from that time to touch upon race and gender relations.  He also made use of other experiences from his personal life to base his writings on.  For instance, the crowded Brooklyn apartment setting in ''A Mother’s Kisses'' was similar to the three-room apartment in the Bronx where he was raised,<ref name=NYT/> while the main character's rejection by Columbia University mirrored his own failed attempt at applying to that institution.<ref name=Schudel/>  The plot of his short story "A Change of Plan", in which a man falls in love with another woman at the hotel pool during his honeymoon in [[Florida]], reflected how Friedman's own honeymoon unfolded in the aforementioned state.<ref name=NYT/>

Friedman was noted for his versatility of writing [[novel]]s, [[Short story|short stories]], [[Play (theatre)|plays]], in addition to being a [[screenwriter]] and magazine editor.<ref>{{cite news|title='Bruce Jay Friedman' interviewed by Derek Alger |url=https://www.pifmagazine.com/2004/10/bruce-jay-friedman/|first=Derek|last=Alger|issue=89|date=October 2004|access-date=June 7, 2020|magazine=Pif Magazine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200607105300/https://www.pifmagazine.com/2004/10/bruce-jay-friedman/|archive-date=June 7, 2020}}</ref>  He frequently discussed how conflicted he felt in composing screenplays for profit and for pleasure, as opposed to his "higher calling" of authoring novels.<ref name=NYT/>  He summed up his attitude towards the former as, "Take the money, scribble a bit, and enjoy the room service".<ref name=Schudel/>

==Personal life and death==
Friedman married his first wife, Ginger Howard, in 1954.<ref name=AP/>  Together, they had three sons: [[Josh Alan Friedman|Josh]], Kipp and [[Drew Friedman (cartoonist)|Drew]].<ref name=NYT/>  They divorced in 1978,<ref name=AP/> after their marriage "crumbled like an old [[graham cracker]]".<ref name="NYT Leland">{{cite news|title=Inside Bruce Jay Friedman's Pulp Arcadia|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/09/books/review/lucky-bruce-by-bruce-jay-friedman-book-review.html|first=John|last=Leland|date=October 7, 2011|access-date=June 3, 2020|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>  Five years later, he married Patricia O'Donohue.<ref name=AP/>  They remained married until his death, and had one daughter, Molly.<ref name=NYT/>

Friedman once got into a quarrel with fellow writer [[Norman Mailer]] at the latter's [[house party]].  It turned physical when Mailer [[headbutt]]ed him and Mailer's wife egged him on to "kill the bastard".<ref name=Schudel/>  Although Friedman eventually prevailed in the fistfight, he had to receive a [[Tetanus vaccine|tetanus shot]] after Mailer bit him in the neck.<ref name=Schudel/>

Friedman died on June 3, 2020, at his home in [[Brooklyn]].  He was 90, and had been suffering from [[Peripheral neuropathy|neuropathy]] in the years leading up to his death.<ref name=NYT/>  According to his wife, Patricia, he was hospitalized one month before his death due to an infection that was not related to [[COVID-19]].<ref name=Schudel/>
