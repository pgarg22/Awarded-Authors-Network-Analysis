'''Mei Yaochen''' ({{CJKV|t=梅堯臣|s=梅尧臣|p=Méi Yáochén|w='''Mei Yao-ch'en'''}}) (1002–1060) was a Chinese [[List of Chinese language poets|poet]] of the [[Song dynasty]]. He was one of the pioneers of the "new subjective" style of poetry which characterized Song [[poetry]].<ref name="Cihai">Cihai: Page 1306.</ref>

Mei Yaochen was born in [[Xuancheng]] in present-day [[Anhui Province]]. His [[style name]] was 'Sheng Yu' ({{lang|zh|圣俞}}).<ref name="Cihai"/> He passed the [[Imperial examination|jinshi]] exam in 1051 and had a career in the [[civil service]], but was unsuccessful.   He was a prolific poet, with around 3000 works extant; he was popularized as a poet by the younger [[Ouyang Xiu]].

Most of his works are in the ''[[Shi (poetry)|shi]]'' form, but they are much freer in content than those of the [[Tang dynasty]].   His response to the impossibility of surpassing the Tang poets was to make a virtue of his lack of ambition; his ideal was 平淡 (pingdan), or the pedestrian.   His early verses are often socio-critical, advocating reform along [[Neo-Confucian]] lines; later he turned to celebrations of ordinary life and verses mourning the deaths of his first wife and several of his children.
An example is his poem translated into English by [[Kenneth Rexroth]] as "An Excuse for Not Returning the Visit of a Friend."
