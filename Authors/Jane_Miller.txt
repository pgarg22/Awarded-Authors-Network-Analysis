==Reviews==
<blockquote>Poet Jane Miller collaborates with artist Beverly Pepper on a highly personal journey through the debris of the poet’s crumbling relationship, and her mother’s descent into illness. Beautifully rendered poems and short chapters of poetic prose combine with Pepper’s chalk and oil drawings to form an intimate and unique meditation on the nature of love, of heartache, of the many midnights we, each and every one of us, live through and carry with us through our lives.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.upne.com/0-9754990-6-8.html|title = Brandeis University Press}}</ref></blockquote>

<blockquote>A major accomplishment of Jane Miller’s Midnights is that she rescues middle-of-the-night ideas from worn-out truisms and offers them as the torturous realities they can be in experience.<ref>[http://galatearesurrection10.blogspot.com/2008/07/midnights-by-jane-miller-beverly-pepper.html ""''MIDNIGHTS'' by JANE MILLER & BEVERLY PEPPER", ''Galatea'', July 20, 2008]</ref></blockquote>

<blockquote>Jane Miller is hardly alone in demanding that the structures of her art reflect the compulsions of consciousness, but unlike poets who allow pallid abstraction to attenuate emotion and song, Miller, as late millennium supplicant, won't relinquish extravagance, seduction, rapture, as essential elements of a poem's brash presence. Her human figure, careening through its volatile relations, "charge card in hand," indebted and reverential, makes of shatter a kind of atomized coherence, a kinetic, compassionate form.<ref>[http://bostonreview.net/BR23.1/volkman.html "Memory at These Speeds: New and Selected Poems", ''Boston Review'', Karen Volkman, February/ March 1998]</ref></blockquote>
