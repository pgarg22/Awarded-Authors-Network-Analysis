{{nihongo|'''Akazome Emon'''|赤染衛門||extra=late 950s or early 960s – 1041 or later}} was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] ''[[waka (poetry)|waka]]'' poet and early historian who lived in the mid-[[Heian period]]. She is a member both of the {{nihongo|[[Thirty Six Elder Poetic Sages]]|中古三十六歌仙|Chūko Sanjūrokkasen}} and the {{nihongo|[[Thirty Six Female Poetic Sages]]|女房三十六歌仙|Nyōbō Sanjūrokkasen}}.

==Biography==
Akazome Emon's year of birth is unknown,{{sfnm|1a1=Saitō|1y=1986|1p=3}} but she was likely born between [[Tentoku|Tentoku 1]] (957) and [[Kōhō|Kōhō 1]] (964).{{sfnm|1a1=Saitō|1y=1986|1p=3}} She was officially the daughter of Akazome Tokimochi (赤染時用),{{sfnm|1a1=Saitō|1y=1986|1p=3}} but the late-[[Heian period|Heian]] karonsho (book of poetic [[criticism]]) ''{{illm|Fukuro-zōshi|ja|袋草紙}}'' records that her biological father was her mother's first husband, [[Taira no Kanemori]].{{sfnm|1a1=Saitō|1y=1986|1p=3}}

A poetic exchange between Emon and [[Fujiwara no Michitaka]], dating to around [[Ten'en|Ten'en 2]] (974) to [[Jōgen (Heian period)|Jōgen 2]] (977),{{sfnm|1a1=Saitō|1y=1986|1p=3}} when she was likely in her late teens, is the earliest dateable event in her life.{{sfnm|1a1=Saitō|1y=1986|1p=3}} At roughly this time, she went to serve in the household of [[Minamoto no Masanobu]],{{sfnm|1a1=Saitō|1y=1986|1p=3}} and for a long time thereafter she served his daughter [[Minamoto no Rinshi|Rinshi]] (<small>[[:ja:源倫子|ja]]</small>), the wife of [[Fujiwara no Michinaga]].{{sfnm|1a1=Saitō|1y=1986|1p=3}}

It was also around this time (Ten'en–Jōgen) that she married {{illm|Ōe no Masahira|ja|大江匡衡}},{{sfnm|1a1=Saitō|1y=1986|1p=3}} a [[Confucian]] scholar and poet of both ''waka'' and ''[[kanshi (poetry)|kanshi]]''.<!-- This description comes from a variety of articles on him at https://kotobank.jp/word/大江匡衡-39054 --> They had a son, {{illm|Ōe no Takachika|ja|大江挙周}},{{sfnm|1a1=Saitō|1y=1986|1p=3}} a daughter, [[Gō Jijū]] (江侍従),{{sfnm|1a1=Saitō|1y=1986|1p=3}} and one more daughter.{{sfnm|1a1=Saitō|1y=1986|1p=3}} The couple were considered to be {{nihongo|"lovebirds"|おしどり夫婦|oshidori fūfu}}.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

According to her personal ''waka'' collection, the ''[[Akazome Emon Shū]]'' (赤染衛門集), when Masahira was twice sent to serve in [[Owari Province]], she accompanied him both times.{{sfnm|1a1=Saitō|1y=1986|1p=3}} The collection also indicates that she worked to ensure her son's professional success at court{{sfnm|1a1=Saitō|1y=1986|1p=3}} and presenting poems as offerings to Sumiyoshi Shrine{{clarification needed|reason=Which one?|date=February 2018}} when he fell ill.{{sfnm|1a1=Saitō|1y=1986|1p=3}} The ''Fukuro-zōshi'' portrays her as gently supporting her husband when he was overwhelmed by his official duties.{{sfnm|1a1=Saitō|1y=1986|1p=3}}<!-- The source says "公任の上表文作成に苦渋する夫", but that's a little unclear, so this somewhat broader statement is safer pending consultation of a more specific source. --> These works present Emon as a good wife and wise mother (良妻賢母 ''ryōsai kenbo'').{{sfnm|1a1=Saitō|1y=1986|1p=3}} She also devoted much effort to her service as Rinshi's lady-in-waiting.{{sfnm|1a1=Saitō|1y=1986|1p=3}}

In [[Chōwa|Chōwa 1]] (1012), her husband died,{{sfnm|1a1=Saitō|1y=1986|1p=3}} and a few years later Emon became a [[bhikkuni|nun]].{{sfnm|1a1=Saitō|1y=1986|1p=3}} She apparently lived a long and tranquil life from this point,{{sfnm|1a1=Saitō|1y=1986|1p=3}} living to see the birth of her great grandson [[Ōe no Masafusa]] in [[Chōkyū|Chōkyū 2]] (1041).{{sfnm|1a1=Saitō|1y=1986|1p=3}}

Akazome Emon served [[Minamoto no Rinshi]] and [[Fujiwara no Shōshi]], respectively the wife and daughter of [[Fujiwara no Michinaga]], and she was present at the Imperial court at the same time as [[Izumi Shikibu]].  She was a contemporary of [[Murasaki Shikibu]], who praised her writing, and [[Sei Shōnagon]].

The year of her death is uncertain,{{sfnm|1a1=Saitō|1y=1986|1p=3}} but she probably lived until at least 1041.{{sfnm|1a1=Saitō|1y=1986|1p=3}}

== Poetry and other writings ==
Emon remained active in ''[[waka (poetry)|waka]]'' composition until late in life,{{sfnm|1a1=Saitō|1y=1986|1p=3}} contributing poems to ''[[uta-awase]]'' competitions on the sixteenth day of the fifth month of [[Chōgen|Chōgen 8]] (1035), the [[Kanpaku-Sadaijin-ke Uta-awase]] (関白左大臣家歌合),{{sfnm|1a1=Saitō|1y=1986|1p=3}} and 1041, the [[Kokiden no Nyōgo Uta-awase]] (弘徽殿女御歌合).{{sfnm|1a1=Saitō|1y=1986|1p=3}} She also contributed a [[screen poem]] (屏風歌 ''byōbu-uta'') to celebrate Rinshi's seventieth year, in 1033.{{sfnm|1a1=Saitō|1y=1986|1p=3}}

She left a [[kashū (poetry)|personal collection]], the ''[[Akazome Emon Shū]]'',{{sfnm|1a1=Saitō|1y=1986|1p=3}} and she is also believed to have been the writer of the first part of ''[[Eiga Monogatari]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Saitō|1y=1986|1p=3}} Her poetry was incorporated into [[court anthologies]] from the ''[[Shūi Wakashū]]'' on.{{sfnm|1a1=Saitō|1y=1986|1p=3}} She ranks fourth in the number of her poems that were included in the ''[[Goshūi Wakashū]]'',{{sfnm|1a1=Saitō|1y=1986|1p=3}} with a total of 32.{{sfnm|1a1=Saitō|1y=1986|1p=3}} More than 60 of her poems were included in the ''[[Kin'yō Wakashū]]'' and later court anthologies.{{sfnm|1a1=Saitō|1y=1986|1p=3}}

In her article on Emon, [[Hiroko Saitō]] called her poetic style unexceptional.
<!--
*Akazome Emon composed this poem upon learning that [[Ōe no Tamemoto]] was headed to the {{nihongo|Eastland|しかすが|shikasuga}}. This is a {{nihongo|poem of parting|離列(の)哥|wakare (no) uta}}; several official poetry anthologies followed the lead of [[Kokin Wakashū]] in having entire chapters devoted to such poems of parting. While the poem appears on the surface to be a trivial remark, she had no hope of Ōe no Tamemoto ever returning; thus this poem is an unsaid goodbye.
*:<span lang="ja">惜ともなき物ゆへにしかすがの&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;渡と聞けばたゞならぬ哉</span>
*:''woshimu tomo nakimono yuhe ni shikasuga no watari to kikeba tada naranu kana'' (classical [[kana]] orthography)
*:loosely: Though I have no reason for regret, upon hearing that you are headed to Shikasuga I am not completely indifferent.
*:([[Shūi Wakashū]] 6:316, written c. 985)
*This poem was composed on the anniversary of [[Ōe no Masahira]]'s death. This is a classic example of explicit seasonal reference, pioneered in the poems on seasons in the [[Kokin Wakashū]], that is typical of [[Heian period|Heian]] poetry.
*:<span lang="ja">こぞの春ちりにし花も咲きにけり&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哀れ別のかゝらましかば</span>
*:''kozo no haru chirinishi hana mo sakinikeri ahare wakare no kakaramashikaba'' (classical kana orthography)
*:loosely: The fallen blossoms of last spring are in bloom again. Oh if it were so with our painful parting!
*:([[Shika Wakashū]] 10:402)
