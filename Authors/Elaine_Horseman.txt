Elaine Hall was born in 1925 in [[Lichfield]], [[Staffordshire]]<ref name=SFFL/> to Harold Hall, a [[Vicar]] [[Choral]], and Olive E. Bowey.

Horseman, a [[Computer Applications|computer applications engineer]], with whom she moved to Bristol and had two sons: Stephen Thomas and Christopher Michael. She became qualified as a teacher at the [[University of Birmingham]] and worked as a [[Primary school|primary school teacher]] from 1944, before she gave up teaching in 1962 in order to write.

Of the second Hubbles or Boffins Club book, the American journal ''Kirkus Reviews'' complemented the easy transitions between fantasy and reality and observed that the children "keep up a steady banter often pleasantly silly, frequently affected, and always very British."<ref name=kirkus2/>
