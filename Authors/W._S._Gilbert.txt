'''Sir William Schwenck Gilbert'''{{refn|The name ''Gilbert'' is pronounced with a [[Hard and soft g#English|hard G]].|group= n}} (18 November 1836&nbsp;– 29 May 1911) was an English [[dramatist]], [[librettist]], poet and illustrator best known for his [[Gilbert and Sullivan|collaboration]] with composer [[Arthur Sullivan]], which produced fourteen [[comic opera]]s.<!--His and Sullivan's preferred term. The G&S Project [[WP:G&S]] uses this term for all of their works.--> The most famous of these include ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' and one of the most frequently performed works in the history of musical theatre, ''[[The Mikado]]''.<ref>Kenrick, John. [http://www.musicals101.com/gilbert3.htm ''G&S Story: Part III''], accessed 13 October 2006; and Powell, Jim. [http://www.libertystory.net/LSARTSGILBERT.htm ''William S. Gilbert's Wicked Wit for Liberty''] accessed 13 October 2006.</ref> The popularity of these works was supported for over a century by year-round performances of them, in Britain and abroad, by the repertory company that Gilbert, Sullivan and their producer [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] founded, the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]]. These [[Savoy opera]]s are still frequently performed in the English-speaking world and beyond.<ref>Bradley, Chapter 1 and ''passim''.</ref>

Gilbert's creative output included over 75 plays and [[libretto|libretti]], and numerous short stories, poems and lyrics, both comic and serious. After brief careers as a government clerk and a lawyer, Gilbert began to focus, in the 1860s, on writing light verse, including his ''[[Bab Ballads]]'', short stories, theatre reviews and illustrations, often for ''[[Fun (magazine)|Fun]]'' magazine. He also began to write [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]] and his first comic plays, developing a unique absurdist, inverted style that would later be known as his "topsy-turvy" style. He also developed a [[realism (arts)|realistic]] method of stage direction and a reputation as a strict theatre director. In the 1870s, Gilbert wrote 40 plays and libretti, including his [[German Reed Entertainments]], several blank-verse "fairy comedies", some serious plays, and his first five collaborations with Sullivan: ''[[Thespis (opera)|Thespis]]'', ''[[Trial by Jury]]'', ''[[The Sorcerer]]'', ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' and ''The Pirates of Penzance''. In the 1880s, Gilbert focused on the Savoy operas, including ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'', ''[[Iolanthe]]'', ''The Mikado'', ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' and ''[[The Gondoliers]]''.

In 1890, after this long and profitable creative partnership, Gilbert quarrelled with Sullivan and Carte concerning expenses at the Savoy Theatre; the dispute is referred to as the "carpet quarrel". Gilbert won the ensuing lawsuit, but the argument caused hurt feelings among the partnership. Although Gilbert and Sullivan were persuaded to collaborate on two last operas, they were not as successful as the previous ones. In later years, Gilbert wrote several plays, and a few operas with other collaborators. He retired, with his wife Lucy, and their ward, [[Nancy McIntosh]], to a country estate, [[Grim's Dyke]]. He was [[Knight bachelor|knighted]] in 1907. Gilbert died of a heart attack while attempting to rescue a young woman to whom he was giving a swimming lesson in the lake at his home.

Gilbert's plays inspired other dramatists, including [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]],<ref>Feingold, Michael, [http://www.villagevoice.com/arts/engaging-the-past-7140486 "Engaging the Past"], ''The Village Voice'', 4 May 2004</ref> and his comic operas with Sullivan inspired the later development of American [[musical theatre]], especially influencing Broadway librettists and lyricists. According to ''[[The Cambridge History of English and American Literature]]'', Gilbert's "lyrical facility and his mastery of metre raised the poetical quality of comic opera to a position that it had never reached before and has not reached since".<ref name=CambridgeHistory>[http://www.bartelby.net/223/0815.html ''The Cambridge History of English and American Literature''], Volume XIII, Chapter VIII, Section 15 (1907–21)</ref>

Gilbert was born at 17 [[Southampton Street, London|Southampton Street]], [[Strand, London|Strand]], London. His father, also named [[William Gilbert (author)|William]], was briefly a [[naval surgeon]], who later became a writer of novels and short stories, some of which his son illustrated. Gilbert's mother was the former Anne Mary Bye Morris (1812–1888), the daughter of Thomas Morris, an apothecary.<ref name=DNB>Stedman, Jane W.

They quarrelled increasingly, and following the break-up of their marriage in 1876, his relationships with them, especially his mother, became even more strained.<ref>Pearson, pp. 16–17</ref> Gilbert had three younger sisters, two of whom were born outside England because of the family's travels during these years: Jane Morris (b. 1838 in [[Milan]], Italy – 1906), who married Alfred Weigall, a miniatures painter; Mary Florence (b. 1843 in [[Boulogne]], France – 1911); and Anne Maude (1845–1932). The younger two never married.<ref>Ainger, family tree and pp. 15–19</ref><ref>Eden, David.

[[File:Gentle Alice Brown.jpg|thumb|left|One of Gilbert's illustrations for his [[Bab Ballads|Bab Ballad]] "Gentle Alice Brown"]]
As a child, Gilbert travelled to Italy in 1838 and then France for two years with his parents, who finally returned to settle in London in 1847. He was educated at [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]], France, from the age of seven (he later kept his diary in French so that the servants could not read it),<ref>Morrison, Robert, [http://www.gilbertandsullivanarchive.org/gilbert/plays/fallen_fairies/article.html "The Controversy Surrounding Gilbert's Last Opera"], The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 2 August 2011, accessed 21 July 2016</ref> then at Western Grammar School, [[Brompton, Kensington|Brompton]], London, and then at the [[Great Ealing School]], where he became head boy and wrote plays for school performances and painted scenery. He then attended [[King's College London]], graduating in 1856. He intended to take the examinations for a commission in the [[Royal Artillery]], but with the end of the [[Crimean War]], fewer recruits were needed, and the only commission available to Gilbert would have been in a [[line regiment]]. Instead he joined the [[Civil Service (United Kingdom)|Civil Service]]: he was an assistant clerk in the [[Privy Council Office (United Kingdom)|Privy Council]] Office for four years and hated it. In 1859, he joined the [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Militia]], a part-time volunteer force formed for the defence of Britain, which he served in until 1878 (in between writing and other work), reaching the rank of captain.<ref>Pearson, p. 16.</ref>{{refn|He first joined the 5th West Yorkshire Militia, and later the Royal Aberdeenshire Highlanders. On leaving the Militia, Gilbert received an honorary promotion to Major.<ref>Stedman (1996) p. 157 and Ainger, p. 154</ref>|group= n}} In 1863, he received a bequest of [[Pound sterling|£]]300 that he used to leave the civil service and take up a brief career as a [[barrister]] (he had already entered the [[Inner Temple]] as a student). His legal practice was not successful, averaging just five clients a year.<ref>Gilbert, W. S. ed. [[Peter Haining (author)|Peter Haining]] – Introduction</ref>

To supplement his income from 1861 on, Gilbert wrote a variety of stories, comic rants, grotesque illustrations, theatre reviews (many in the form of a parody of the play being reviewed),<ref>Stedman, Jane W. ''W. S. Gilbert's Theatrical Criticism''. London: The Society for Theatre Research, 2000. {{ISBN|0-85430-068-6}}</ref> and, under the pseudonym "Bab" (his childhood nickname), illustrated poems for several comic magazines, primarily ''[[Fun (magazine)|Fun]]'', started in 1861 by [[Henry James Byron|H. J. Byron]]. He published stories, articles, and reviews in papers such as ''[[The Cornhill Magazine]], London Society, Tinsley's Magazine'' and ''Temple Bar''. In addition, Gilbert was the London correspondent for ''L'Invalide Russe'' and a drama critic for the ''Illustrated London Times''. In the 1860s he also contributed to [[Tom Hood]]'s Christmas annuals, to ''Saturday Night'', the ''Comic News'' and the ''Savage Club Papers''. ''[[The Observer]]'' newspaper in 1870 sent him to France as a war correspondent reporting on the [[Franco-Prussian War]].<ref name=DNB/>

[[File:Gilberts1867.gif|upright|thumb|Gilbert and his wife, Lucy, in 1867]]
The poems, illustrated humorously by Gilbert, proved immensely popular and were reprinted in book form as the ''[[Bab Ballads]]''.<ref>Stedman (1996), pp. 26–29.</ref>{{refn|See also the introduction to Gilbert, W. S. (1908), ''The Bab Ballads,'' etc., which details the history of the collections it was drawn from.|group= n}} He would later return to many of these as source material for his plays and comic operas. Gilbert and his colleagues from ''Fun'', including [[Thomas William Robertson|Tom Robertson]], [[Tom Hood]], [[Clement Scott]] and [[F. C. Burnand]] (who defected to ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' in 1862) frequented the Arundel Club, the [[Savage Club]], and especially Evans's café, where they had a table in competition with the ''Punch'' 'Round table'.<ref>Stedman (1996), pp. 16–18.</ref>{{refn|See also Tom Robertson's play ''[[Society (play)|Society]]'', which fictionalised the evenings in Evans's café in one scene.<ref>Robertson, Tom. [https://archive.org/stream/societyandcastee00robeuoft/societyandcastee00robeuoft_djvu.txt ''Society''], Act 2, Scene 1</ref>|group= n}}

After a relationship in the mid-1860s with the novelist [[Annie Hall Cudlip|Annie Thomas]],<ref>Ainger, p. 52</ref> Gilbert married Lucy Agnes Turner (1847–1936), whom he called "Kitty", in 1867; she was 11 years his junior. He wrote many affectionate letters to her over the years. Gilbert and Lucy were socially active both in London and later at [[Grim's Dyke]], often holding dinner parties and being invited to others' homes for dinner, in contrast to the picture painted by fictionalisations such as the film ''[[Topsy-Turvy]]''. The Gilberts had no children, but they had many pets, including some exotic ones.<ref>Ainger, p. 148 and Stedman (1996), pp. 318–20. See also Bond, Jessie. [http://gsarchive.net/books/bond/016.html Reminiscences, Chapter 16] and McIntosh, Nancy. "The Late Sir W. S. Gilbert's Pets" in the ''W. S. Gilbert Society Journal'', Brian Jones, ed. Vol. 2 No. 18: Winter 2005 (reprinted from ''Country Life'', 3 June 1911), pp.&nbsp;548–56</ref>

===First plays===
Gilbert wrote and directed several plays at school, but his first professionally produced play was ''Uncle Baby'', which ran for seven weeks in the autumn of 1863.{{refn|David Eden (in ''Gilbert and Sullivan: The Creative Conflict'' 1986) and Andrew Crowther both speculate that the play was written in collaboration with Gilbert's father.<ref>Crowther (2011), p. 45</ref>|group= n}}

[[File:Pantomimes of 1866 - Hush-a-Bye Baby.png|thumb|left|250px|''Hush-a-Bye Baby, On the Tree Top'' – an 1866 [[pantomime]] by Gilbert and [[Charles Millward]]]]
In 1865–66, Gilbert collaborated with Charles Millward on several [[pantomime]]s, including one called ''Hush-a-Bye, Baby, On the Tree Top, or, Harlequin Fortunia, King Frog of Frog Island, and the Magic Toys of Lowther Arcade'' (1866).<ref>Stedman (1996), pp. 34–35.</ref> Gilbert's first solo success came a few days after ''Hush-a-Bye Baby'' premiered. His friend and mentor, Tom Robertson, was asked to write a pantomime but did not think he could do it in the two weeks available, and so he recommended Gilbert instead. Written and rushed to the stage in 10 days, ''[[Dulcamara, or the Little Duck and the Great Quack]]'', a [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] of [[Gaetano Donizetti]]'s ''[[L'elisir d'amore]]'', proved extremely popular. This led to a long series of further Gilbert opera burlesques, pantomimes and [[farce]]s, full of awful [[pun]]s (traditional in burlesques of the period),<ref name=LaViv>Gilbert, W. S. ''[[La Vivandière (Gilbert)|La Vivandière, or, True to the Corps!]]'' (a burlesque of Donizetti's ''[[The Daughter of the Regiment]]'')</ref> though showing, at times, signs of the satire that would later be a defining part of Gilbert's work.<ref name=CambridgeHistory/>{{refn|The full quote refers to ''[[Pygmalion and Galatea (play)|Pygmalion and Galatea]]'' and reads: "The satire is shrewd, but not profound; the young author is apt to sneer, and he has by no means learned to make the best use of his curiously logical fancy. That he occasionally degrades high and beautiful themes is not surprising. To do so had been the regular proceeding in burlesque, and the age almost expected it; but Gilbert's is not the then usual hearty cockney vulgarity."|group= n}} For instance:

{{cquote|That men were monkeys once – to that I bow;<br />''(looking at Lord Margate)'' I know one who's less man than monkey, now;<br />That monkeys once were men, peers, statesmen, flunkies –<br />That's rather hard on unoffending monkeys!<ref name=LaViv/>}}

This was followed by Gilbert's penultimate operatic parody, ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]'', a burlesque of [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]]'s opera, ''[[Robert le diable (opera)|Robert le diable]]'', which was part of a triple bill that opened the [[Gaiety Theatre, London]], in 1868. The piece was Gilbert's biggest success to date, running for over 100 nights and being frequently revived and played continuously in the provinces for three years thereafter.<ref>Stedman (1996), p. 62</ref>

<!-- The quote from The Pretty Druidess where Gilbert announces his leaving behind of these derivative works would be useful here. -->In Victorian theatre, "[to degrade] high and beautiful themes&nbsp;... had been the regular proceeding in burlesque, and the age almost expected it"<ref name=CambridgeHistory/> However, Gilbert's burlesques were considered unusually tasteful compared to the others on the London stage. [[Isaac Goldberg]] wrote that these pieces "reveal how a playwright may begin by making burlesque of opera and end by making opera of burlesque."<ref>Goldberg (1931), p. xvii</ref> Gilbert would depart even further from the burlesque style from about 1869 with plays containing original plots and fewer puns. His first full-length prose comedy was ''[[An Old Score]]'' (1869).<ref>

===German Reed entertainments and other plays of the early 1870s===
[[File:Ages Ago.png|thumb|''[[Ages Ago]]'', 1870]]
Theatre, at the time Gilbert began writing, had fallen into disrepute. Badly translated and adapted French [[operetta]]s and poorly written, prurient [[Victorian burlesque]]s dominated the London stage. As [[Jessie Bond]] vividly described it, "stilted tragedy and vulgar farce were all the would-be playgoer had to choose from, and the theatre had become a place of evil repute to the righteous British householder."<ref name=JessieBond>Bond, Jessie, [http://gsarchive.net/books/bond/intro.html ''Reminiscences'', Introduction.]</ref> Bond created the mezzo-soprano roles in most of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, and is here leading into a description of Gilbert's role reforming the Victorian theatre.<ref name=JessieBond/>

From 1869 to 1875, Gilbert joined with one of the leading figures in theatrical reform, [[Thomas German Reed]] (and his wife [[Priscilla Horton|Priscilla]]), whose [[German Reed Entertainment|Gallery of Illustration]] sought to regain some of theatre's lost respectability by offering family entertainments in London.<ref name=JessieBond/> So successful were they that by 1885 Gilbert stated that original British plays were appropriate for an innocent 15-year-old girl in the audience.{{refn|Gilbert gave a speech in 1885 at a dinner to benefit the Dramatic and Musical Sick Fund, which is reprinted in ''The Era'', 21 February 1885, p. 14, in which he said: "In&nbsp;... the dress circle on the rare occasion of the first performance of an original English play sits a young lady of fifteen.  She is a very charming girl – gentle, modest, sensitive – carefully educated and delicately nurtured&nbsp;... an excellent specimen of a well-bred young English gentlewoman; and it is with reference to its suitability to the eyes and ears of this young lady that the moral fitness of every original English play is gauged on the occasion of its production.  It must contain no allusions that cannot be fully and satisfactorily explained to this young lady; it must contain no incident, no dialogue, that can, by any chance, summon a blush to this young lady's innocent face.&nbsp;... I happen to know that, on no account whatever, would she be permitted to be present at a première of M. [[Victorien Sardou]] or M. [[Alexandre Dumas]].&nbsp;... the dramatists of France can only ring out threadbare variations of that dirty old theme – the cheated husband, the faithless wife, and the triumphant lover."|group= n}} Three months before the opening of Gilbert's last burlesque (''The Pretty Druidess''), the first of his pieces for the Gallery of Illustration, ''[[No Cards]]'', was produced. Gilbert created six [[German Reed Entertainment|musical entertainments]] for the German Reeds, some with music composed by Thomas German Reed.<ref name=PlayList>[http://gsarchive.net/gilbert/plays/plays_home.html List of Gilbert's Plays] at the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 26 May 2009</ref>

The environment of the German Reeds' intimate theatre allowed Gilbert quickly to develop a personal style and freedom to control all aspects of production, including set, costumes, direction and stage management.<ref>Crowther (2011), pp. 82–83</ref> These works were a success,<ref>Stedman (1996), pp. 69–80.</ref> with Gilbert's first big hit at the Gallery of Illustration, ''[[Ages Ago]]'', opening in 1869. ''Ages Ago'' was also the beginning of a collaboration with the composer [[Frederic Clay]] that would last seven years and produce four works.<ref name=CrowtherAgesAgo>Crowther, Andrew, [http://www.gilbertandsullivanarchive.org/gilbert/plays/ages_ago/crowther_analysis.html "''Ages Ago'' – Early Days"], The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 23 August 2011, accessed 21 July 2016</ref> It was at a rehearsal for ''Ages Ago'' that Clay formally introduced Gilbert to his friend, Arthur Sullivan.<ref name=CrowtherAgesAgo/>{{refn|This rehearsal was probably for a second run of ''Ages Ago'' in 1870.|group= n}}<ref>Crowther (2011), p. 84</ref> The Bab Ballads and Gilbert's many early musical works gave him much practice as a lyricist even before his collaboration with Sullivan.

[[File:The Happy Land - Illustrated London News, March 22, 1873.PNG|thumb|left|Scene from ''[[The Happy Land]]'', ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', 22 March 1873, illustrated by [[D. H. Friston]]]]
Many of the plot elements of the German Reed Entertainments (as well as some from his earlier plays and Bab Ballads) would be reused by Gilbert later in the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas. These elements include paintings coming to life (''Ages Ago'', used again in ''[[Ruddigore]]''), a deaf nursemaid binding a respectable man's son to a "pirate" instead of to a "pilot" by mistake (''[[Our Island Home]]'', 1870, reused in ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]''), and the forceful mature lady who is "an acquired taste" (''[[Eyes and No Eyes]]'', 1875, reused in ''[[The Mikado]]'').<ref>Smith, J. Donald, ''[http://gasdisc.oakapplepress.com/reed_operas.htm W. S. Gilbert's Operas for the German Reeds]''</ref> During this time, Gilbert perfected the 'topsy-turvy' style that he had been developing in his Bab Ballads, where the humour was derived by setting up a ridiculous premise and working out its logical consequences, however absurd.<ref>Crowther (2000), p. 35. See also Gilbert's play, ''[[Topsyturveydom]]''.</ref> [[Mike Leigh]] describes the "Gilbertian" style as follows: "With great fluidity and freedom, [Gilbert] continually challenges our natural expectations. First, within the framework of the story, he makes bizarre things happen, and turns the world on its head. Thus the Learned Judge marries the Plaintiff, the soldiers metamorphose into aesthetes, and so on, and nearly every opera is resolved by a deft moving of the goalposts&nbsp;... His genius is to fuse opposites with an imperceptible sleight of hand, to blend the surreal with the real, and the caricature with the natural. In other words, to tell a perfectly outrageous story in a completely deadpan way."<ref name = "MikeLeigh">Leigh, Mike. [http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,1938719,00.html "True anarchists"], ''The Guardian'', 3 November 2006</ref>

At the same time, Gilbert created several "fairy comedies" at the [[Haymarket Theatre]]. This series of plays was founded upon the idea of self-revelation by characters under the influence of some magic or some supernatural interference.<ref>[http://www.savoyoperas.org.uk/others/pygmalion.html "Miss Anderson as Galatea", ''The New-York Times'', 1883 January 23 32(9791): 5, col. 3 Amusements] Downloaded 15 October 2006.</ref> The first was ''[[The Palace of Truth]]'' (1870), based partly on a story by [[Madame de Genlis]]. In 1871, with ''[[Pygmalion and Galatea (play)|Pygmalion and Galatea]]'', one of seven plays that he produced that year, Gilbert scored his greatest hit to date. Together, these plays and their successors such as ''[[The Wicked World]]'' (1873), ''[[Sweethearts (play)|Sweethearts]]'' (1874), and ''[[Broken Hearts]]'' (1875), did for Gilbert on the dramatic stage what the German Reed entertainments had done for him on the musical stage: they established that his capabilities extended far beyond burlesque, won him artistic credentials, and demonstrated that he was a writer of wide range, as comfortable with human drama as with farcical humour. The success of these plays, especially ''Pygmalion and Galatea'', gave Gilbert a prestige that would be crucial to his later collaboration with as respected a musician as Sullivan.<ref name=Wren>Wren, p. 13.</ref>

| style="text-align: left;" | "It is absolutely essential to the success of this piece that it should be played with the most perfect earnestness and gravity throughout. There should be no exaggeration in costume, makeup or demeanour; and the characters, one and all, should appear to believe, throughout, in the perfect sincerity of their words and actions. Directly the actors show that they are conscious of the absurdity of their utterances the piece begins to drag."

During this period, Gilbert also pushed the boundaries of how far satire could go in the theatre. He collaborated with [[Gilbert Arthur à Beckett]] on ''[[The Happy Land]]'' (1873), a political satire (in part, a parody of his own ''The Wicked World''), which was briefly banned because of its unflattering caricatures of [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] and his ministers.<ref>Rees, Terence. "''The Happy Land'': its true and remarkable history" in ''W. S. Gilbert Society Journal'' vol. 1, no. 8 (1994), pp. 228–37</ref> Similarly, ''[[The Realm of Joy]]'' (1873) was set in the lobby of a theatre performing a scandalous play (implied to be the ''Happy Land''), with many jokes at the expense of the [[Lord Chamberlain]] (the "Lord High Disinfectant", as he's referred to in the play).<ref>Crowther, Andrew.

These works anticipated the 'problem plays' of [[George Bernard Shaw|Shaw]] and [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]].<ref name=CrowtherCharity>Crowther, Andrew.

===As director===
Once he became established, Gilbert was the stage director for his plays and operas and had strong opinions on how they should best be performed.<ref>Stedman (1996), p. 39</ref> He was strongly influenced by the innovations in "stagecraft", now called stage direction, by the playwrights [[James Planché]] and especially [[Thomas William Robertson|Tom Robertson]].<ref name=JessieBond/> Gilbert attended rehearsals directed by Robertson to learn this art first-hand from the older director, and he began to apply it in some of his earliest plays.<ref>Crowther (2011), p. 74</ref> He sought realism in acting, settings, costumes, and movement, if not in content of his plays (although he did write a romantic comedy in the "naturalist" style, as a tribute to Robertson, ''[[Sweethearts (play)|Sweethearts]]''). He shunned self-conscious interaction with the audience, and insisted on a style of portrayal in which characters were never aware of their own absurdity, but were coherent internal wholes.<ref>Cox-Ife, ''passim''. See also Gilbert, W. S., [http://gsarchive.net/gilbert/short_stories/stage_play.html "A Stage Play"] and Bond, Jessie, [http://gsarchive.net/books/bond/intro.html ''Reminiscences'', Introduction].</ref>

In Gilbert's 1874 burlesque, ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (Gilbert)|Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]]'', the character Hamlet, in his speech to the players, sums up Gilbert's theory of comic acting: "I hold that there is no such antick fellow as your bombastical hero who doth so earnestly spout forth his folly as to make his hearers believe that he is unconscious of all incongruity".<ref>Gilbert, W. S. ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (Gilbert)|Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]]'', Tableau III, 1874</ref> Robertson "introduced Gilbert both to the revolutionary notion of disciplined rehearsals and to mise-en-scène or unity of style in the whole presentation – direction, design, music, acting."<ref name = "MikeLeigh"/> Like Robertson, Gilbert demanded discipline in his actors.

==Collaboration with Sullivan==

===First collaborations amidst other works===
In 1871, John Hollingshead commissioned Gilbert to work with Sullivan on a holiday piece for Christmas, ''[[Thespis (opera)|Thespis, or The Gods Grown Old]]'', at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]]. ''Thespis'' outran five of its nine competitors for the 1871 holiday season, and its run was extended beyond the length of a normal run at the Gaiety,<ref>Walters, Michael.  "Thespis: a reply",  ''W. S. Gilbert Society Journal'', Vol. 4, part 3, Issue 29.  Summer 2011.</ref> However, nothing more came of it at that point, and Gilbert and Sullivan went their separate ways. Gilbert worked again with Clay on ''[[Happy Arcadia]]'' (1872), and with [[Alfred Cellier]] on ''[[Topsyturveydom]]'' (1874), as well as writing several farces, operetta libretti, [[extravaganza]]s, fairy comedies, adaptations from novels, translations from the French, and the dramas described above. Also in 1874, he published his last contribution for ''Fun'' magazine (''"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern"''), after a gap of three years, then resigned due to disapproval of the new owner's other publishing interests.<ref>Jones, John Bush, "W. S. Gilbert's Contributions to Fun, 1865–1874", published in the ''Bulletin of the New York Public Library'', vol 73 (April 1969), pp. 253–66</ref>

[[File:Thespis - Illustrated London News Jan 6 1872.png|thumb|left|Illustration of ''Thespis'' in ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', 6 January 1872]]
It would be nearly four years after ''Thespis'' was produced before the two men worked together again. In 1868, Gilbert had published a short comic sketch in ''Fun'' magazine titled "Trial by Jury: An Operetta". In 1873, Gilbert was asked by the theatrical manager, [[Carl Rosa]], to write a work for his planned 1874 season. Gilbert expanded ''Trial'' into a one-act libretto. However, Rosa's wife [[Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa]], a childhood friend of Gilbert's, died after an illness in 1874 and Rosa dropped the project.<ref>Stedman, p. 121</ref> Later in 1874 Gilbert offered the libretto to [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], but Carte could not use the piece at that time. By early 1875, Carte was managing the [[Royalty Theatre]], and he needed a short opera to play as an afterpiece to [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]]'s ''[[La Périchole]]''. He contacted Gilbert, asked about the piece, and suggested Sullivan to set the work. Sullivan was enthusiastic, and ''[[Trial by Jury]]'' was composed in a matter of weeks. The little piece was a runaway hit, outlasting the run of ''La Périchole'' and being revived at another theatre.<ref>Walbrook, H. M. (1922), [http://gsarchive.net/books/walbrook/chap3.html ''Gilbert and Sullivan Opera, a History and Comment'' (Chapter 3)].</ref>{{refn|Richard Traubner quotes Sullivan's recollection of Gilbert reading the libretto of ''Trial by Jury'' to him: "As soon as he had come to the last word he closed up the manuscript violently, apparently unconscious of the fact that he had achieved his purpose so far as I was concerned, in as much as I was screaming with laughter the whole time."<ref>Traubner, Richard. ''Operetta: A Theatrical History'', p. 153, Taylor & Francis (2003) {{ISBN|0-203-50902-1}}</ref>|group= n}}

Gilbert continued his quest to gain respect in and respectability for his profession. One thing that may have been holding dramatists back from respectability was that plays were not published in a form suitable for a "gentleman's library", as, at the time, they were generally cheaply and unattractively published for the use of actors rather than the home reader. To help rectify this, at least for himself, Gilbert arranged in late 1875 for publishers Chatto and Windus to print a volume of his plays in a format designed to appeal to the general reader, with an attractive binding and clear type, containing Gilbert's most respectable plays, including his most serious works, but mischievously capped off with ''Trial by Jury''.<ref>Gilbert (1875), ''passim''</ref>

[[File:W.S. Gilbert's burlesque comedy, Engaged.jpg|thumb|''[[Engaged (play)|Engaged]]'' (1877) is still produced.]]
After the success of ''Trial by Jury'', there were discussions towards reviving ''Thespis'', but Gilbert and Sullivan were not able to agree on terms with Carte and his backers. The score to ''Thespis'' was never published, and most of the music is now lost. It took some time for Carte to gather funds for another Gilbert and Sullivan opera, and in this gap Gilbert produced several works including ''[[Tom Cobb]]'' (1875), ''[[Eyes and No Eyes]]'' (1875, his last German Reed Entertainment), and ''[[Princess Toto]]'' (1876), his last and most ambitious work with Clay, a three-act comic opera with full orchestra, as opposed to the shorter works for much reduced accompaniment that came before. Gilbert also wrote two serious works during this time, ''[[Broken Hearts]]'' (1875) and ''[[Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith]]'' (1876).<ref name=PlayList/>

Also during this period, Gilbert wrote, ''[[Engaged (play)|Engaged]]'' (1877), which inspired [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]''. ''Engaged'' is a parody of romantic drama written in the "topsy-turvy" satiric style of many of Gilbert's Bab Ballads and the [[Savoy Opera]]s—with one character pledging his love, in the most poetic and romantic language, to every single woman in the play. The story portrays some "innocent" Scottish rustics making a living by throwing trains off the lines and then charging the passengers for services and, in parallel, romance being gladly thrown over in favour of monetary gain. A ''[[New York Times]]'' reviewer wrote in 1879, "Mr Gilbert, in his best work, has always shown a tendency to present improbabilities from a probable point of view, and in one sense, therefore, he can lay claim to originality; fortunately this merit in his case is supported by a really poetic imagination. In [''Engaged''] the author gives full swing to his humor, and the result, although exceedingly ephemeral, is a very amusing combination of characters – or caricatures – and mock-heroic incidents."<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1879/02/18/archives/dramtic-and-musical-park-theatre.html "Dramatic and Musical"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 18 February 1879, p. 5 {{subscription}}</ref> ''Engaged'' is still performed today, by both professional and amateur companies.<ref>Corry, John.

===Peak collaborative years===
{{main|Gilbert and Sullivan}}
[[File:The Princess - W. S. Gilbert.png|thumb|Gilbert reworked his 1870 farce, ''[[The Princess (play)|The Princess]]'', illustrated here, into ''[[Princess Ida]]'' (1884).]]
Carte finally assembled a syndicate in 1877 and formed the Comedy Opera Company to launch a series of original English comic operas, beginning with a third collaboration between Gilbert and Sullivan, ''[[The Sorcerer]]'', in November 1877. This work was a modest success,<ref>Ainger, pp. 147–52</ref> and ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' followed in May 1878. Despite a slow start, mainly due to a scorching summer, ''Pinafore'' became a red-hot favourite by autumn. After a dispute with Carte over the division of profits, the other Comedy Opera Company partners hired thugs to storm the theatre one night to steal the sets and costumes, intending to mount a rival production. The attempt was repelled by stagehands and others at the theatre loyal to Carte, and Carte continued as sole impresario of the newly renamed [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]].<ref>Bond, Jessie, [http://gsarchive.net/books/bond/004.html Chapter 4].</ref> Indeed, ''Pinafore'' was so successful that over a hundred unauthorised productions sprang up in America alone. Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte tried for many years to control the American performance copyrights over their operas, without success.<ref>Rosen, Zvi S. [https://ssrn.com/abstract=963540 "The Twilight of the Opera Pirates: A Prehistory of the Right of Public Performance for Musical Compositions"], accessed 26 May 2009</ref>

For the next decade, the [[Savoy opera|Savoy Operas]] (as the series came to be known, after the [[Savoy Theatre|theatre]] Carte later built to house them) were Gilbert's principal activity. The successful comic operas with Sullivan continued to appear every year or two, several of them being among the longest-running productions up to that point in the history of the musical stage.<ref name=beauty>[http://www.stagebeauty.net/th-frames.html?http&&&www.stagebeauty.net/th-longr.html List of longest running London shows through 1920].</ref>{{refn|''Pinafore'', ''Patience'' and ''The Mikado'' each held the position of second longest-running musical theatre production in history for a time (after adjusting Pinafore's initial run down to 571 performances), and ''The Gondoliers'' was not far behind.<ref name=beauty/>|group= n}} After ''Pinafore'' came ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' (1879), ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'' (1881), ''[[Iolanthe]]'' (1882), ''[[Princess Ida]]'' (1884, based on Gilbert's earlier farce, ''[[The Princess (play)|The Princess]]''), ''[[The Mikado]]'' (1885), ''[[Ruddigore]]'' (1887), ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' (1888) and ''[[The Gondoliers]]'' (1889). Gilbert not only directed and oversaw all aspects of production for these works, but he actually ''designed'' the costumes himself for ''Patience'', ''Iolanthe'', ''Princess Ida'', and ''Ruddigore''.<ref>[http://gsarchive.net/whowaswho/G/GilbertWS.htm  Profile of W.

During this time, Gilbert and Sullivan also collaborated on one other major work, the oratorio ''[[The Martyr of Antioch]]'', premiered at the Leeds music festival in October 1880. Gilbert arranged the original epic poem by [[Henry Hart Milman]] into a libretto suitable for the music, and it contains some original work. During this period, also, Gilbert occasionally wrote plays to be performed elsewhere–both serious dramas (for example ''[[The Ne'er-Do-Weel]]'', 1878; and [[Gretchen (play)|Gretchen]], 1879) and humorous works (for example ''[[Foggerty's Fairy]]'', 1881). However, he no longer needed to turn out multiple plays each year, as he had done before. Indeed, during the more than nine years that separated ''The Pirates of Penzance'' and ''The Gondoliers'', he wrote just three plays outside of the partnership with Sullivan.<ref name=PlayList/> Only one of these works, ''Comedy and Tragedy'', proved successful.<ref>''Foggerty's Fairy'': Crowther, Andrew.

With respect to ''[[Brantinghame Hall]]'', Stedman writes, "It was a failure, the worst failure of Gilbert's career."<ref>Stedman (1996), p. 254</ref>

In 1878, Gilbert realised a lifelong dream to play [[Harlequinade|Harlequin]], which he did at the Gaiety Theatre as part of an amateur charity production of ''[[The Forty Thieves]]'', partly written by himself. Gilbert trained for Harlequin's stylised dancing with his friend [[John D'Auban]], who had arranged the dances for some of his plays and would choreograph most of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas.<ref name=Timesobit>"Mr. D'Auban's 'Startrap' Jumps".

===Carpet quarrel and end of the collaboration===
Gilbert's working relationship with Sullivan sometimes became strained, especially during their later operas, partly because each man saw himself as subjugating his work to the other's, and partly due to their opposing personalities. Gilbert was often confrontational and notoriously thin-skinned, though given to acts of extraordinary kindness, while Sullivan eschewed conflict.<ref name=Carpet>Crowther, Andrew, [http://www.gilbertandsullivanarchive.org/articles/html/quarrel.html "The Carpet Quarrel Explained"], The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 28 June 1997, accessed 22 July 2016</ref> Gilbert imbued his libretti with "topsy-turvy" situations in which the social order was turned upside down. After a time, these subjects were often at odds with Sullivan's desire for realism and emotional content.<ref>See, e.g. Ainger, p. 288, or Wolfson, p. 3</ref> In addition, Gilbert's political satire often poked fun at those in the circles of privilege, while Sullivan was eager to socialise among the wealthy and titled people who would become his friends and patrons.<ref>See, e.g. Jacobs (1992); Crowther (2011); and Bond, Jessie. [http://gsarchive.net/books/bond/016.html Chapter 16], The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 22 July 2016.</ref>{{refn|Stedman notes some of Sullivan's cuts to Gondoliers to remove anti-[[monarchist]] sentiments.<ref>Stedman (1996), pp. 264–65</ref>|group= n}}

[[File:WSG by Holl.jpg|thumb|Portrait by [[Frank Holl]] (1886) in the [[National Portrait Gallery (United Kingdom)|National Portrait Gallery]], London, next to [[John Everett Millais|Millais]]' 1888 portrait of Sullivan]]
Throughout their collaboration, Gilbert and Sullivan disagreed several times over the choice of a subject. After both ''Princess Ida'' and ''Ruddigore'', which were less successful than the seven other operas from ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' to ''The Gondoliers'', Sullivan asked to leave the partnership, saying that he found Gilbert's plots repetitive and that the operas were not artistically satisfying to him. While the two artists worked out their differences, Carte kept the Savoy open with revivals of their earlier works. On each occasion, after a few months' pause, Gilbert responded with a libretto that met Sullivan's objections, and the partnership continued successfully.<ref name=Carpet/>

In April 1890, during the run of ''The Gondoliers'', however, Gilbert challenged Carte over the expenses of the production. Among other items to which Gilbert objected, Carte had charged the cost of a new carpet for the Savoy Theatre lobby to the partnership.<ref name=Ford>

''Limelight Magazine'', Haymarket Media Ltd., 8 June 2011
</ref> Gilbert believed that this was a maintenance expense that should be charged to Carte alone. Gilbert confronted Carte, who refused to reconsider the accounts. Gilbert stormed out and wrote to Sullivan that "I left him with the remark that it was a mistake to kick down the ladder by which he had risen".<ref name=Carpet/> [[Helen Carte]] wrote that Gilbert had addressed Carte "in a way that I should not have thought you would have used to an offending menial."<ref>Stedman, p. 270</ref> The scholar Andrew Crowther has commented:

<blockquote>After all, the carpet was only one of a number of disputed items, and the real issue lay not in the mere money value of these things, but in whether Carte could be trusted with the financial affairs of Gilbert and Sullivan. Gilbert contended that Carte had at best made a series of serious blunders in the accounts, and at worst deliberately attempted to swindle the others. It is not easy to settle the rights and wrongs of the issue at this distance, but it does seem fairly clear that there was something very wrong with the accounts at this time. Gilbert wrote to Sullivan on 28 May 1891, a year after the end of the "Quarrel", that Carte had admitted "an unintentional overcharge of nearly £1,000 in the electric lighting accounts alone."<ref name=Carpet/></blockquote>

Gilbert brought suit, and after ''The Gondoliers'' closed in 1891, he withdrew the performance rights to his libretti, vowing to write no more operas for the Savoy.<ref name=vowed>Shepherd, Marc. [http://gsarchive.net/grand_duke/html/index.html "Introduction: Historical Context"], ''The Grand Duke'', p. vii, New York: Oakapple Press, 2009.  Linked at ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'', accessed 7 July 2009.</ref> Gilbert next wrote ''[[The Mountebanks (opera)|The Mountebanks]]'' with [[Alfred Cellier]] and the flop ''[[Haste to the Wedding]]'' with [[George Grossmith]],<ref name=PlayList/> and Sullivan wrote ''[[Haddon Hall (opera)|Haddon Hall]]'' with [[Sydney Grundy]]. Gilbert eventually won the lawsuit and felt vindicated, but his actions and statements had been hurtful to his partners. Nevertheless, the partnership had been so profitable that, after the financial failure of the [[Royal English Opera House]], Carte and his wife sought to reunite the author and composer.<ref name=vowed/>

[[File:Utopia Limited Poster.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The Drawing Room Scene from ''[[Utopia, Limited]]'']]
In 1891, after many failed attempts at reconciliation by the pair, [[Chappell & Co.|Tom Chappell]], the music publisher responsible for printing the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, stepped in to mediate between two of his most profitable artists, and within two weeks had succeeded.<ref>Wolfson, p. 7.</ref> Two more operas resulted: ''[[Utopia, Limited]]'' (1893) and ''[[The Grand Duke]]'' (1896). Gilbert also offered a third libretto to Sullivan (''[[His Excellency (opera)|His Excellency]]'', 1894), but Gilbert's insistence on casting [[Nancy McIntosh]], his protégée from ''Utopia'', led to Sullivan's refusal.<ref>Wolfson, pp. 61–65.</ref> ''Utopia'', concerning an attempt to "anglicise" a south Pacific island kingdom, was only a modest success, and ''The Grand Duke'', in which a theatrical troupe, by means of a "statutory duel" and a conspiracy, takes political control of a grand duchy, was an outright failure. After that, the partnership ended for good.<ref>Wolfson, passim</ref> Sullivan continued to compose comic opera with other librettists but died four years later. In 1904, Gilbert would write, "...&nbsp;Savoy opera was snuffed out by the deplorable death of my distinguished collaborator, Sir Arthur Sullivan. When that event occurred, I saw no one with whom I felt that I could work with satisfaction and success, and so I discontinued to write ''libretti''."<ref>Letter to the Editor, ''The Times'', 12 March 1904; p. 9</ref>

Although Gilbert announced a retirement from the theatre after the short run of his last work with Sullivan, ''[[The Grand Duke]]'' (1896) and the poor reception of his 1897 play ''[[The Fortune Hunter]]'', he produced at least three more plays over the last dozen years of his life, including an unsuccessful opera, ''[[Fallen Fairies]]'' (1909), with [[Edward German]].<ref>Wolfson, pp. 102–03.</ref> Gilbert also continued to supervise the various revivals of his works by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, including its London Repertory seasons in 1906–09.<ref>Wolfson, p. 102.</ref> His last play, ''[[The Hooligan]]'', produced just four months before his death, is a study of a young condemned thug in a prison cell. Gilbert shows sympathy for his protagonist, the son of a thief who, brought up among thieves, kills his girlfriend. As in some earlier work, the playwright displays "his conviction that nurture rather than nature often accounted for criminal behaviour".<ref name=Bradley100>Bradley, Ian. [http://www.historytoday.com/ian-bradley/ws-gilbert-he-was-englishman "W. S. Gilbert: He was an Englishman"]. ''History Today'', Vol. 61, Issue 5, 2011</ref> The grim and powerful piece became one of Gilbert's most successful serious dramas, and experts conclude that, in those last months of Gilbert's life, he was developing a new style, a "mixture of irony, of social theme, and of grubby realism,"<ref>Stedman (1996), p. 343.</ref> to replace the old "Gilbertianism" of which he had grown weary.<ref>Crowther, Andrew.

Gilbert was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] on 15 July 1907 in recognition of his contributions to drama.<ref>Ainger, pp. 417–18</ref> Sullivan had been knighted for his contributions to music almost a quarter of a century earlier, in 1883. Gilbert was, however, the first British writer ever to receive a knighthood for his plays alone – earlier dramatist knights, such as Sir [[William Davenant]] and Sir [[John Vanbrugh]], were knighted for political and other services.<ref>Stedman (1996), p. 328.</ref>

On 29 May 1911, Gilbert was about to give a swimming lesson to two young women, Winifred Isabel Emery (1890–1972),<ref>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/76473?docPos=1 Biography] of [[David Gascoyne]], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', accessed 2 June 2011</ref><ref>[[Sidney Dark|Dark, Sidney]] and Rowland Grey.

==Personality==
Gilbert was known for being sometimes prickly. Aware of this general impression, he claimed that "If you give me your attention",<ref>Howarth, Paul and Feldman, A. [http://gsarchive.net/princess_ida/webop/pi_06.html "If you give me your attention"], Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 29 May 2011</ref> the [[misanthrope]]'s song from ''[[Princess Ida]]'', was a satiric self-reference, saying: "I thought it my duty to live up to my reputation."<ref name=Prickly>Grossmith, George. "Recollections of Sir W. S. Gilbert", ''The Bookman'', vol. 40, no. 238, July 1911, p. 162</ref> However, many people have defended him, often citing his generosity. Actress [[May Fortescue]] recalled, <blockquote>His kindness was extraordinary. On wet nights and when rehearsals were late and the last buses were gone, he would pay the cab-fares of the girls whether they were pretty or not, instead of letting them trudge home on foot&nbsp;... He was just as large-hearted when he was poor as when he was rich and successful. For money as money he cared less than nothing. Gilbert was no plaster saint, but he was an ideal friend.<ref>Dark and Grey, pp. 157–58</ref></blockquote>

[[File:Ws gilbert cartoon.png|thumb|upright|Caricature from ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', 1881]]
The journalist Frank M. Boyd wrote:

{{quote |I fancy that seldom was a man more generally given credit for a personality quite other than his own, than was the case with Sir W. S. Gilbert&nbsp;... Till one actually came to know the man, one shared the opinion held by so many, that he was a gruff, disagreeable person; but nothing could be less true of the really great humorist. He had rather a severe appearance&nbsp;... and like many other clever people, he had precious little use for fools of either sex, but he was at heart as kindly and lovable a man as you could wish to meet.<ref>Boyd, Frank M. [https://archive.org/stream/pelicanstalefift00boydrich/pelicanstalefift00boydrich_djvu.txt ''A Pelican's Tale, Fifty Years of London and Elsewhere''], p. 195, London: [[Herbert Jenkins Ltd]] (1919)</ref>}}

[[Jessie Bond]] wrote that Gilbert "was quick-tempered, often unreasonable, and he could not bear to be thwarted, but how anyone could call him unamiable I cannot understand."<ref>Bond, Jessie, [http://gsarchive.net/books/bond/016.html Chapter 16]</ref> [[George Grossmith]] wrote to ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' that, although Gilbert had been described as an autocrat at rehearsals, "That was really only his manner when he was playing the part of stage director at rehearsals. As a matter of fact, he was a generous, kind true gentleman, and I use the word in the purest and original sense."<ref name=GG1911>George Grossmith's tribute to Gilbert in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 7 June 1911</ref>

Aside from his occasional creative disagreements with, and eventual rift from, Sullivan, Gilbert's temper sometimes led to the loss of friendships. For instance, he quarrelled with his old associate [[C. H. Workman]], over the firing of Nancy McIntosh from the production of ''Fallen Fairies'', and with actress [[Henrietta Hodson]]. He also saw his friendship with theatre critic [[Clement Scott]] turn bitter. However, Gilbert could be extraordinarily kind. During Scott's final illness in 1904, for instance, Gilbert donated to a fund for him, visited nearly every day, and assisted Scott's wife,<ref>Scott, Mrs. Clement, ''Old Days in Bohemian London'' (c.1910). New York: Frederick A. Stokes Company. pp. 71–72</ref> despite having not been on friendly terms with him for the previous sixteen years.<ref>See Stedman (1996), pp. 254–56, 323–24</ref> Similarly, Gilbert had written several plays at the behest of comic actor [[Edward Askew Sothern|Ned Sothern]]. However, Sothern died before he could perform the last of these, ''Foggerty's Fairy''. Gilbert purchased the play back from his grateful widow.<ref>Ainger, pp. 193–94.</ref> According to one London society lady:

{{quote|[Gilbert]'s wit was innate, and his rapier-like retorts slipped out with instantaneous ease.  His mind was naturally fastidious and clean; he never asserted himself, never tried to make an effect.  He was great-hearted and most understanding, with an underlying poetry of fancy that made him the most delicious companion.  They spoke of his quick temper, but that was entirely free from malice or guile.  He was soft-hearted as a babe, but there was nothing of the hypocrite about him.  What he thought he said on the instant, and though by people of sensitive vanity this might on occasion be resented, to a sensitiveness of a finer kind it was an added link, binding one to a faithful, valued friend.<ref>''Anonymous'' 1871–1935, p. 238, London: John Murray (1936)</ref>}}

[[File:WSGilbert by Spy.jpg|thumb|upright|Gilbert by the cartoonist [[Leslie Ward|'Spy']], 1880s]]
As the writings about Gilbert by husband and wife [[Seymour Hicks]] and [[Ellaline Terriss]] (frequent guests at his home) vividly illustrate, Gilbert's relationships with women were generally more successful than his relationships with men.<ref>Hicks, Seymour and Terriss, Ellaline [http://gasdisc.oakapplepress.com/mdpemberton-wsg.htm ''Views of W. S. Gilbert''], reproduced at Gilbert and Sullivan Discography, accessed 22 July 2016</ref> According to Grossmith, Gilbert "was to those who knew him a courteous and amiable gentleman – a gentleman without veneer."<ref name=Prickly/> Grossmith and many others wrote of how Gilbert loved to amuse children:

{{quote|During my dangerous illness, Mr. Gilbert never failed a day to come up and enquire after me&nbsp;... and kept me in roars of laughter the whole time&nbsp;... But to see Gilbert at his best, is to see him at one of his juvenile parties. Though he has no children of his own, he loves them, and there is nothing he would not do to please them. I was never so astonished as when on one occasion he put off some of his own friends to come with Mrs. Gilbert to a juvenile party at my own house.<ref>Grossmith, p. 190</ref>}}

Gilbert's niece Mary Carter confirmed, "...&nbsp;he loved children very much and lost no opportunity of making them happy&nbsp;... [He was] the kindest and most human of uncles."<ref>Carter, Mary. Letter to the editor of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 6 January 1956</ref> Grossmith quoted Gilbert as saying, "[[Deer-stalking]] would be a very fine sport if only the deer had guns."<ref name=GG1911/>

==Legacy==
{{details|Cultural influence of Gilbert and Sullivan}}
In 1957, a review in ''The Times'' explained "the continued vitality of the Savoy operas" as follows:
{{quote|[T]hey were never really contemporary in their idiom&nbsp;... Gilbert and Sullivan's [world], from the first moment was obviously not the audience's world, [it was] an artificial world, with a neatly controlled and shapely precision which has not gone out of fashion – because it was never in fashion in the sense of using the fleeting conventions and ways of thought of contemporary human society&nbsp;... The neat articulation of incredibilities in Gilbert's plots is perfectly matched by his language&nbsp;... His dialogue, with its primly mocking formality, satisfies both the ear and the intelligence.  His verses show an unequalled and very delicate gift for creating a comic effect by the contrast between poetic form and prosaic thought and wording&nbsp;... How deliciously [his lines] prick the bubble of sentiment.  Gilbert had many imitators, but no equals, at this sort of thing&nbsp;... [Of] equal importance&nbsp;... Gilbert's lyrics almost invariably take on extra point and sparkle when set to Sullivan's music&nbsp;... The two men together remain endlessly and incomparably delightful&nbsp;... Light, and even trifling, though [the operas] may seem upon grave consideration, they yet have the shapeliness and elegance that can make a trifle into a work of art.<ref>"The Lasting Charm of Gilbert and Sullivan: Operas of an Artificial World", ''The Times'', 14 February 1957, p. 5</ref>}}

[[File:Gilbert-library.jpg|thumb|left|Gilbert in his library]]
Gilbert's legacy, aside from building the [[Garrick Theatre]] and writing the Savoy Operas and other works that are still being performed or in print nearly 150 years after their creation, is felt perhaps most strongly today through his influence on the American and British musical theatre. The innovations in content and form of the works that he and Sullivan developed, and in Gilbert's theories of acting and stage direction, directly influenced the development of the modern musical throughout the 20th century.<ref name=PeterDowns>Downs, Peter.

Gilbert's influence on the English language has also been marked, with well-known phrases such as "A policeman's lot is not a happy one", "[[short, sharp shock]]", "What never? Well, hardly ever!",<ref>[http://gsarchive.net/sullivan/interviews/lawrence.html Lawrence, Arthur H. "An illustrated interview with Sir Arthur Sullivan"], Part 3, from ''[[The Strand Magazine]]'', Vol. xiv, No.84 (December 1897)</ref> and "let the punishment fit the crime" arising from his pen.{{refn|The last phrase is a satiric take on [[Cicero]]'s ''De Legibus'', 106 B.C.<ref>Green, Edward.

Ian Bradley, in connection with the 100th anniversary of Gilbert's death in 2011 wrote:
{{quote|There has been much discussion about Gilbert's proper place in British literary and dramatic history. Was he essentially a writer of burlesque, a satirist, or, as some have argued, the forerunner of the [[theatre of the absurd]]?&nbsp;... Perhaps he stands most clearly in that distinctively English satirical tradition which stretches back to [[Jonathan Swift]].&nbsp;... Its leading exponents lampoon and send up the major institutions and public figures of the day, wielding the weapon of grave and temperate irony with devastating effect, while themselves remaining firmly within the Establishment and displaying a deep underlying affection for the objects of their often merciless attacks. It is a combination that remains a continuing enigma.<ref name=Bradley100/>}}
