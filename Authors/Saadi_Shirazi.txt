==Biography==
Saadi was born in [[Shiraz, Iran|Shiraz]], Iran, according to some, shortly after 1200, according to others sometime between 1213 and 1219.<ref>J.A. Boyle (1977), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/615851 "Review of: Morals Pointed and Tales Adorned: The Būstān of Sa'dī by Sa'dī, by G. M. Wickens"]. ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies'', University of London Vol. 40, No. 1. Boyle writes: "It is not clear on what authority Wickens states 'with reasonable confidence' that Sa'di was born ''c.'' 1200. In an article published as long ago as 1937, the late Abbas Eghbal demonstrated that the poet's birth must fall somewhere between 610/1213-14 and 615/1218-19. See the ''Sa'dī-nāma'' ed. Ḥabīb Yaghma'ī, Tehran 1316/1937-8, 627-45, (especially 640-10)."</ref> In the [[Gulistan (book)|Golestan]], composed in 1258, he says in lines evidently addressed to himself, "O you who have lived fifty years and are still asleep"; another piece of evidence is that in one of his ''qasida'' poems he writes that he left home for foreign lands when the Mongols came to his homeland Fars, an event which occurred in 1225.<ref>Katouzian, ''Sa'di'', p. 11</ref> Saadi was a [[Sunni]] Muslim.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YShKAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA194|title=Leadership through the Classics: Learning Management and Leadership from Ancient East and West Philosophy|year=2014|publisher=Springer|page=194|isbn=978-3-642-32445-1|access-date=2015-03-20}}</ref> According to [[Annemarie Schimmel]] the tendency of [[Shia]]<ref>[http://www.islamquest.ir/fa/archive/question/fa9076 Poems such as Saadi, Hazez, ...] islamquest.ir Retrieved 4 May 2020</ref><ref>[https://www.seratnews.com/fa/news/107268/ Sect of Hafez and Saadi] seratnews.com Retrieved 4 May 2020</ref><ref>[https://hawzah.net/fa/News/View/93261/ Dr.Velayati: Molavi/Hafez/Saadi were Shia] hawzah.net Retrieved 4 May 2020</ref> to associate with the [[Sunni]] poet became the norm after [[Twelver|Twelver Shiaism]] became the state religion of the [[Safavid Empire]].<ref>[[Annemarie Schimmel]], ''Deciphering the Signs of God'', 302 pp., SUNY Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-7914-1982-7}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-1982-3}} (see p.210)</ref>

Saadi Shirazi whose family were from religious scholars, missed his father when he was a child. Then he was under the guardianship of his maternal grandmother.<ref>[https://rasekhoon.net/article/show/185221/%D8%B4%DB%8C%D8%AE-%D9%85%D8%B5%D9%84%D8%AD-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%DB%8C%D9%86-%D8%B3%D8%B9%D8%AF%DB%8C-%D8%B4%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B2%DB%8C Muslih al-Dīn Saadi Shirazi] rasekhoon.net</ref> He narrates memories of going out with his father as a child during festivities.

After leaving Shiraz he enrolled at the [[Al-Nizamiyya of Baghdad|Nizamiyya]] University in [[Baghdad]], where he studied [[Islamic science]]s, [[law]], [[governance]], [[history]], [[Persian literature]], and [[Islamic theology]]; it appears that he had a scholarship to study there. In the Golestan, he tells us that he studied under the scholar Abu'l-Faraj ibn al-Jawzi (presumably the younger of two scholars of that name, who died in 1238).<ref name=Kat10>Katouzian, ''Sa'di'', p. 10.</ref>

In the Bustan and Golestan Saadi tells many colourful anecdotes of his travels, although some of these, such as his supposed visit to the remote eastern city of [[Kashgar]] in 1213, may be fictional.<ref>Katouzian, ''Sa'di'', pp. 10, 15.</ref> The unsettled conditions following the [[Mongol]] invasion of [[Khwarezm]] and Iran led him to wander for thirty years abroad through [[Anatolia]] (where he visited the Port of [[Adana]] and near [[Konya]] met [[Ghazi warriors|ghazi]] landlords), [[Syria]] (where he mentions the famine in [[Damascus]]), [[Egypt]] (where he describes its music, [[bazaar]]s, clerics and elites), and [[Iraq]] (where he visits the port of [[Basra]] and the [[Tigris]] river). In his writings he mentions the [[qadi]]s, [[mufti]]s of [[Al-Azhar]], the grand [[bazaar]], music and art. At [[Halab]], Saadi joins a group of [[Sufi]]s who had fought arduous battles against the [[Crusaders]]. Saadi was captured by [[Crusaders]] at [[Acre (Israel)|Acre]] where he spent seven years as a slave digging trenches outside its fortress. He was later released after the [[Mamluk]]s paid ransom for Muslim prisoners being held in Crusader dungeons.

Saadi visited [[Jerusalem]] and then set out on a pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/isl/bus/bus07.htm |title=The Bustan of Sadi: Chapter III. Concerning Love |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |access-date=2012-08-13}}</ref> It is believed that he may have also visited [[Oman]] and other lands in the south of the [[Arabian Peninsula]].

Because of the Mongol invasions he was forced to live in desolate areas and met caravans fearing for their lives on once-lively silk trade routes. Saadi lived in isolated refugee camps where he met bandits, Imams, men who formerly owned great wealth or commanded armies, intellectuals, and ordinary people. While Mongol and European sources (such as [[Marco Polo]]) gravitated to the potentates and courtly life of [[Ilkhanate]] rule, Saadi mingled with the ordinary survivors of the war-torn region. He sat in remote tea houses late into the night and exchanged views with merchants, farmers, preachers, wayfarers, thieves, and [[Sufi]] mendicants. For twenty years or more, he continued the same schedule of preaching, advising, and learning, honing his sermons to reflect the wisdom and foibles of his people. Saadi's works reflect upon the lives of ordinary Iranians suffering displacement, agony and conflict during the turbulent times of the Mongol invasion.
[[File:Sadi and the youth of kashgar Bukhara 1547.JPG|thumb|Saadi Shirazi is welcomed by a youth from [[Kashgar]] during a forum in [[Bukhara]].]]

Saadi mentions honey-gatherers in [[Iranian Azerbaijan|Azarbaijan]], fearful of Mongol plunder. He finally returns to Persia where he meets his childhood companions in [[Isfahan]] and other cities. At [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] Saadi befriends a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[Emir]] named Tughral. Saadi joins him and his men on their journey to [[Sindh]] where he meets Pir Puttur, a follower of the [[Persia]]n [[Sufi]] grand master Shaikh Usman Marvandvi (1117–1274).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fl6qYIcln8MC&q=Debal |title=Personal Observations on Sindh: The Manners and Customs of Its Inhabitants ... – Thomas Postans – Google Boeken |access-date=2012-08-13|last1=Postans |first1=Thomas |year=1843 |isbn=9788120617186 }}</ref>

He also refers in his writings about his travels with a Turkic Amir named Tughral in [[Sindh]] (Pakistan across the [[Indus]] and [[Thar Desert|Thar]]), India (especially [[Somnath]], where he encounters [[Brahmans]]), and [[Central Asia]] (where he meets the survivors of the Mongol invasion in Khwarezm). Tughral hires [[Hindu]] sentinels. Tughral later enters service of the wealthy [[Delhi Sultanate]], and Saadi is invited to [[Delhi]] and later visits the [[Vizier]] of Gujarat. During his stay in [[Gujarat]], Saadi learns more about the [[Hindus]] and visits the large temple of [[Somnath]], from which he flees due to an unpleasant encounter with the [[Brahmans]]. Katouzian calls this story "almost certainly fictitious".<ref>Katouzian, ''Saidi'', p. 16.</ref>

Saadi came back to Shiraz before 1257 CE / 655 AH (the year he finished composition of his  [[Bustan (book)|Bustan]]). Saadi mourned in his poetry the fall of [[Abbasid Caliphate]] and [[Baghdad]]'s destruction by Mongol invaders led by [[Hulagu]] in February 1258.

When he reappeared in his native Shiraz, he might have been in his late forties. Shiraz, under [[Atabak Abubakr ibn Sa'd ibn Zangi]] (1231–60), the [[Salghurids|Salghurid]] ruler of [[Fars Province|Fars]], was enjoying an era of relative tranquility. Saadi was not only welcomed to the city but was shown great respect by the ruler and held to be among the greats of the province. Some scholars believe that Saadi took his [[Pen name|nom de plume]] (in Persian ''takhallos'') from the name of Abubakr's son, Sa'd, to whom he dedicated the Golestan; however, Katouzian argues that it is likely that Saadi had already taken the name from Abubakr's father Sa'd ibn Zangi (d. 1226).<ref>Katouzian ''Sa'di'', p. 13.</ref> Some of Saadi's most famous panegyrics were composed as a gesture of gratitude in praise of the ruling house and placed at the beginning of his ''Bustan''. The remainder of Saadi's life seems to have been spent in Shiraz.

The traditional date for Saadi's death is between 1291 and 1294.<ref name=Kat10 />

==Works==
===Bustan and Gulistan===
{{Main|Bostan (book)|l1=Bustan|Gulistan of Sa'di|l2=Gulistan}}
[[File:Sadi1.jpg|thumb|The first page of ''[[Bostan (book)|Bustan]]'', from a [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] manuscript.]]
[[File:گلستان سعدی-1364.jpg|thumb|Gulistan Saadi (Calligraphy of Golestan Saadi in [[Nastaliq]] script)]]
Sa'di's best known works are ''Bustan'' (The Orchard) completed in 1257 and ''Gulistan'' (The Rose Garden) completed in 1258.<ref name=WDL2>{{cite web|title=Sa'di's "Gulistan"|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/6829/|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|access-date=25 December 2013}}</ref> ''Bustan'' is entirely in verse (epic metre). It consists of stories aptly illustrating the standard virtues recommended to Muslims (justice, liberality, modesty, contentment) and reflections on the behavior of dervishes and their ecstatic practices. ''Gulistan'' is mainly in prose and contains stories and personal anecdotes. The text is interspersed with a variety of short poems which contain aphorisms, advice, and humorous reflections, demonstrating Saadi's profound awareness of the absurdity of human existence. The fate of those who depend on the changeable moods of kings is contrasted with the freedom of the dervishes.<ref name=WDL2/>

Regarding the importance of [[profession]]s Saadi writes:<ref name="sacred-texts.com_2">{{cite web|url=https://www.sacred-texts.com/isl/gulistan.txt |title=The Gulistan of Sadi: Chapter VII. On The Effects Of Education, Story 2 |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |access-date=2020-07-19}}</ref>

:''O darlings of your fathers, learn the trade because property and riches of the world are not to be relied upon; also silver and gold are an occasion of danger because either a thief may steal them at once or the owner spend them gradually; but a profession is a living fountain and permanent wealth; and although a professional man may lose riches, it does not matter because a profession is itself wealth and wherever you go you will enjoy respect and sit on high places, whereas those who have no trade will glean crumbs and see hardships.''

Saadi is also remembered as a [[panegyrics|panegyrist]] and lyricist, the author of a number of odes portraying human experience, and also of particular odes such as the lament on the fall of [[Baghdad]] after the Mongol invasion in 1258. His lyrics are found in ''Ghazaliyat'' (Lyrics) and his odes in ''Qasa'id'' (Odes). He is also known for a number of works in Arabic.

In the ''Bustan'', Saadi writes of a man who relates his time in battle with the Mongols:<ref name="sacred-texts.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/isl/bus/bus09.htm |title=The Bustan of Sadi: Chapter V. Concerning Resignation |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |access-date=2012-08-13}}</ref>

<blockquote>
In Isfahan I had a friend who was warlike, spirited, and shrewd....after long I met him: "O tiger-seizer!" I exclaimed, "what has made thee decrepit like an old fox?"

He laughed and said: "Since the days of war against the Mongols, I have expelled the thoughts of fighting from my head. Then did I see the earth arrayed with spears like a forest of reeds. I raised like smoke the dust of conflict; but when Fortune does not favour, of what avail is fury? I am one who, in combat, could take with a spear a ring from the palm of the hand; but, as my star did not befriend me, they encircled me as with a ring. I seized the opportunity of flight, for only a fool strives with Fate. How could my helmet and cuirass aid me when my bright star favoured me not? When the key of victory is not in the hand, no one can break open the door of conquest with his arms.

The enemy were a pack of leopards, and as strong as elephants. The heads of the heroes were encased in iron, as were also the hoofs of the horses. We urged on our Arab steeds like a cloud, and when the two armies encountered each other thou wouldst have said they had struck the sky down to the earth. From the raining of arrows, that descended like hail, the storm of death arose in every corner. Not one of our troops came out of the battle but his cuirass was soaked with blood. Not that our swords were blunt—it was the vengeance of stars of ill fortune. Overpowered, we surrendered, like a fish which, though protected by scales, is caught by the hook in the bait. Since Fortune averted her face, useless was our shield against the arrows of Fate.
</blockquote>

===Other works===
In addition to the Bustan and Gulistan, Saadi also wrote four books of love poems ([[ghazal]]s), and number of longer mono-rhyme poems ([[qasida]]s) in both Persian and Arabic. There are also quatrains and short pieces, and some lesser works in prose and poetry.<ref>Katouzian, ''Sa'di'', pp. 25, 33-35.</ref> Together with [[Rumi]] and [[Hafez]], he is considered one of the three greatest ghazal-writers of Persian poetry.<ref>Katouzian ''Sa'di'', p. 33.</ref>

===''Bani Adam''===
{{main|Bani Adam}}
[[File:The Rose Garden - WDL.tiff|thumb|A copy of Saadi Shirazi's works by the [[Bosniak]] scholar [[Safvet beg Bašagić]] (1870–1934)]]
Saadi is well known for his aphorisms, the most famous of which, ''[[Bani Adam]]'', is part of the ''Gulistan''. In a delicate way it calls for breaking down all barriers between human beings:<ref>From ''Gulistan'' Saadi. chapter 1, story 10</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dibache.com/text.asp?cat=3&id=1338 |title=گلستان سعدی، باب اول، تصحیح محمدعلی فروغی |publisher=Dibache.com |access-date=2012-08-13}}</ref>

The original Persian text is as follows:<blockquote style="text-align:left">

The literal translation of the above is as follows:

<blockquote>
"The children of Adam are the members of each other,<br />
who are in their creation from the same essence.<br />
When day and age hurt one of these members,<br />
other members will be left (with) no serenity.<br />
If you are unsympathetic to the misery of others,<br />
it is not right that they should call you a human being."

The above version with ''yekdīgar'' "one another" is the usual one quoted in Iran (for example, in the well-known edition of [[Mohammad Ali Foroughi]], on the carpet installed in the United Nations building in New York in 2005,<ref>[https://ifpnews.com/exclusive/zarif-narrates-story-iranian-carpet-hung-uns-wall/ "Zarif Narrates Story of Iranian Carpet Hung up on UN’s Wall"].

The webpage appears to be no longer available.</ref> Some books, however, print a variation ''banī ādam a'zā-ye yek <u>peykar</u>-and'' ("The sons of Adam are members of one body"), and this version, which accords more closely with the [[hadith]] quoted below, is followed by most English translations.

The following translation is by H. Vahid Dastjerdi:<ref>[Vahid Dastjerdi, H. 2006, East of Sophia (Mashriq-e-Ma'rifat). Qom: Ansariyan.]</ref>
<blockquote>
''Adam's sons are body limbs, to say;''<br />
''For they're created of the same clay.''<br />
''Should one organ be troubled by pain,''<br />
''Others would suffer severe strain.''<br />
''Thou, careless of people's suffering,''<br />
''Deserve not the name, "human being".''
</blockquote>

This is a verse translation by Ali Salami:

<blockquote>
''Human beings are limbs of one body indeed;''<br />
''For, they’re created of the same soul and seed.''<br />
''When one limb is afflicted with pain,''<br />
''Other limbs will feel the bane.''<br />
''He who has no sympathy for human suffering,''<br />
''Is not worthy of being called a human being.''
</blockquote>

And by Richard Jeffrey Newman:<ref>[http://richardjnewman.com/my-books/selections-from-saadis-gulistan/ Selections from Saadi's Gulisan], translated by Richard Jeffrey Newman (Global Scholarly Publications 2004)</ref>

<blockquote>
''All men and women are to each other''<br />
''the limbs of a single body, each of us drawn''<br />
''from life’s shimmering essence, God’s perfect pearl;''<br />
''and when this life we share wounds one of us,''<br />
''all share the hurt as if it were our own.''<br />
''You, who will not feel another’s pain,''<br /> 
''you forfeit the right to be called human.''

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  said in Tehran: "[...] At the entrance of the United Nations there is a magnificent carpet – I think the largest carpet the United Nations has – that adorns the wall of the United Nations, a gift from the people of Iran.

''Bani Adam'' was used by the [[British people|British]] [[Band (rock and pop)|rock band]] [[Coldplay]] in their song {{lang|fa|بنی آدم}}, with the title Bani Adam written in Persian script. The song is featured on their 2019 album [[Everyday Life (Coldplay album)|Everyday Life]].

==Legacy and poetic style==
Saadi distinguished between the spiritual and the practical or mundane aspects of life. In his ''Bustan'', for example, spiritual Saadi uses the mundane world as a spring board to propel himself beyond the earthly realms. The images in ''Bustan'' are delicate in nature and soothing. In the ''Gulistan'', on the other hand, mundane Saadi lowers the spiritual to touch the heart of his fellow wayfarers. Here the images are graphic and, thanks to Saadi's dexterity, remain concrete in the reader's mind. Realistically, too, there is a ring of truth in the division. The Sheikh preaching in the [[Khanqah]] experiences a totally different world than the merchant passing through a town. The unique thing about Saadi is that he embodies both the Sufi Sheikh and the travelling merchant. They are, as he himself puts it, two almond kernels in the same shell.

Saadi's prose style, described as "simple but impossible to imitate" flows quite naturally and effortlessly. Its simplicity, however, is grounded in a semantic web consisting of [[synonymy]], [[homophony]], and [[oxymoron]] buttressed by internal [[rhythm]] and external [[rhyme]].

Chief among these works is [[Goethe]]'s ''West-Oestlicher Divan.'' [[Andre du Ryer]] was the first European to present Saadi to the West, by means of a partial [[French language|French]] translation of ''Gulistan'' in 1634. [[Adam Olearius]] followed soon with a complete translation of the ''Bustan'' and the ''Gulistan'' into [[German language|German]] in 1654.

In his Lectures on Aesthetics, [[Hegel]] wrote (on the Arts translated by Henry Paolucci, 2001, p.&nbsp;155–157):<blockquote>Pantheistic poetry has had, it must be said, a higher and freer development in the Islamic world, especially among the Persians ... The full flowering of Persian poetry comes at the height of its complete transformation in speech and national character, through Mohammedanism ... In later times, poetry of this order [Ferdowsi's epic poetry] had a sequel in love epics of extraordinary tenderness and sweetness; but there followed also a turn toward the didactic, where, with a rich experience of life, the far-traveled Saadi was master before it submerged itself in the depths of the pantheistic mysticism taught and recommended in the extraordinary tales and legendary narrations of the great Jalal-ed-Din Rumi.</blockquote>

[[Alexander Pushkin]], one of Russia's most celebrated poets, quotes Saadi in his work ''[[Eugene Onegin]]'', "as Saadi sang in earlier ages,
'some are far distant, some are dead'."<ref>Full text of [http://lib.ru/LITRA/PUSHKIN/ENGLISH/onegin_j.txt Eugene Onegin] is available here.</ref> ''Gulistan'' was an influence on the fables of [[Jean de La Fontaine]].<ref name=WDL2/> [[Benjamin Franklin]] in one of his works, DLXXXVIII ''A Parable on Persecution'', quotes one of [[Bustan (book)|Bustan]] of Saadi's parable, apparently without knowing the source.<ref>Yohannan, J. D.  ''Persian Poetry in England and America: A Two Hundred Year History ''. 1977. New York: Caravan Books. {{ISBN|978-0882060064}} pp. XXV-XXVI</ref> [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] was also interested in Sadi's writings, contributing to some translated editions himself. Emerson, who read Saadi only in translation, compared his writing to the [[Bible]] in terms of its wisdom and the beauty of its narrative.<ref>Milani, A. ''Lost Wisdom''. 2004. Washington. {{ISBN|0-934211-90-6}} p. 39</ref>

The French physicist [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot]]'s third given name is from Saadi's name. It was chosen by his father because of his great interest toward Saadi and his poems, [[Lazare Carnot]].

[[Voltaire]] was very thrilled with his works especially ''[[Gulistan (book)|Gulistan]]'', even he enjoyed being called "Saadi" in his friends' circle.
