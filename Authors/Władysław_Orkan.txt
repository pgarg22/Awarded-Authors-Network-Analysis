'''Władysław Orkan''' (27 November 1875 &ndash; 14 May 1930) (actually born as ''Franciszek Ksawery Smaciarz'', changed [[surname]] to Smreczyński, but primarily known under his [[pen name]], Orkan) was a [[Poles|Polish]] writer and poet from the [[Young Poland]] period. He is known as one of the greatest Polish writers from [[Podhale]] region and ''[[Gorals|Góral]]'' folk; the most famous of his works portray the common people from that region.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Wladyslaw-Orkan |title=Władysław Orkan |access-date=28 February 2020}}</ref>

==Biography==
Born in [[Poręba Wielka, Limanowa County]] as ''Franciszek Ksawery Smaciarz'', he attended the [[elementary school]] in [[Szczyrzyc]]. He started publishing while in the fourth grade; he also joined many extracurricular clubs and organization, including pro-Polish independence ones. Due to his involvement in such activities, his grades suffered, and he never passed the [[matura]] exam. He returned to Poręba village, and continued writing. He debuted in 1896 with a publication of a poem, patriotic poem ''Nad grobem matki'' and several satirical verses. In 1898 he published his first work, collection of short stories, ''Nowele''; that year he also changed his [[surname]] in to Smreczyński. He published more works soon thereafter: another collection short stories ''Nad urwiskiem'' in 1900, a novel ''Komornicy'' (1900), drama ''Postronni'' (1903), a verse volume ''Z tej smutnej ziemi'' (1903), novel ''W roztokach'' (1908) and others.

In early 1900s he started construction of a new house; the same building later became the [[Biographical Museum of Władysław Orkan]] (''Muzeum Biograficzne Władysława Orkana'' or ''Orkanówka'' for short). At that time he also married Maria Zwierzyńska and they had one child, Zofia. Maria died three years after giving birth, and Władysław Orkan, always troubled with finances, asked his sister to raise his daughter. He later married Bronisława Folejewska. During those years he also travelled to Italy, Switzerland, and Germany.

During the [[First World War]] he joined the [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish Legions]] (4th Regiment). For most of his life he stayed in Poręba village. In addition to writing, he was also an activist for the region, cofounder and member of [[Podhale Association]] (Tatras Highlanders Union, 1918) and supporter of peasants’ movement. After the war, he continued to write; particularly notable are lyrical poems constituting a cycle ''Pochwała życia'', the drama ''Widma'' (1917–1927), the novel ''Czantoria'' (1928–1929) and his articles and essays ''Listy ze wsi'' (1925–1927). He died in [[Kraków]]; shortly before he could collect the 1930 City of [[Warsaw]]’s Award for Literature. He is buried at the [[Rakowicki Cemetery]], but next year he was exhumed and moved to a [[Remembrance Cemetery at Pęksowy Brzyzek]], [[Zakopane]].

After his death, many regional organisations were set up under his name, to commemorate his contribution to the culture and prestige of the [[Podhale]] region.
