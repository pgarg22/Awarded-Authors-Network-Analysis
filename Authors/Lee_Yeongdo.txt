'''Lee Yeongdo''' ({{Korean|hangul=이영도|hanja=李英道}}; born 1972)<ref name = "dr" /> is a Korean novelist known for his work in [[fantasy (genre)|fantasy]] and science fiction genre. He is best known for his ''[[Dragon Raja]]'' series of fantasy novels which is also his debut work, serialised on an online forum from 1997 and published on its completion in 1998.<ref name="dr">{{cite book |title= Dragon Raja|last= Lee|first= Yeongdo|year= 1998|publisher= Golden Bough, Inc.|location= Seoul|isbn= 89-8273-052-4}}</ref>

At the time ''Dragon Raja'' was first published, Korean readership for fantasy genre(specifically its [[medievalist]] form) was considered unsubstantial and unaccounted for by press. But ''Dragon Raja'' has sold close to 2 million books in 4 languages.<ref name="dr abroad">{{cite news|publisher=The Dong-a Ilbo

This was a significant feat for the fantasy genre in Korea where the annual circulation of domestic literature and fiction titles as a whole, ranges between 12~20 million copies.<ref name="kr pub">{{cite web|url=http://www.kpa21.or.kr|title=Total circulation trend by subjects over the recent decade (New titles, 1998~2007)|date=July 2008|publisher=[[Korean Publishers Association]]|access-date=24 August 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208143301/http://www.kpa21.or.kr/|archive-date=8 February 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Dragon Raja's success has prompted a rapid growth of Korean fantasy and science fiction genre, and contributed to the growing acceptance of [[web fiction]], referred to as "Internet literature", both by the country's general public and literary world.

Lee is currently one of the best-selling fantasy writers in Korea.<ref name=hankook>{{cite news|publisher=Hankook Ilbo

==Background==

===Early life===
Lee was born in 1972 in [[Busan]], South Korea, the first child of two brothers.<ref name=twin1>{{cite web| url = http://twinpix.egloos.com/4002318| title =News: Signing and Tea with Lee Yeongdo – Report Pt.1| publisher= Where Wings Are Spread([[Korean language|Korean]]: 날개를 펴는 곳)| access-date =26 August 2011}}</ref> When Lee was 2 years old, his family moved to [[Masan]] in [[South Gyeongsang]] Province where he has lived since.<ref name = "birthplace" /> As a child he read heavily in various subjects.<ref name="fn">{{cite news|publisher=Financial News

He started writing seriously from 1993, but didn't think that he would be writing novels.<ref name="naver">{{cite news|publisher=Naver Book Today
|url=http://book.naver.com/bookdb/today_book.nhn?bid=63992|title=Interview with author Lee Yeongdo – Separating Writing and Writer|date=31 January 2009 | access-date=26 August 2011}}</ref>

===Beginnings of the "typer"===
Mid-1990s were when fantasy and science fiction literature was just being introduced to Korea. Lee remembered that "if you asked people what is fantasy, they would say 'Isn't that like western martial arts'" in a 2008 interview.<ref name="yonhap" /> He found the genre attractive and decided to try a story with it.<ref name="naver" /> It was also when various [[online service providers]] similar to [[CompuServe]] in United States (but different in its interface being text-only) were emerging. Lee joined one such provider, Hitel, to start posting on its [[Serial (literature)|Serial]] forum what would be the first chapters of ''Dragon Raja''.

Lee serialized ''Dragon Raja'' from October 1997 to April 1998, referring to himself as "typer" as he typed and didn't pen his work. The chapters quickly gained popularity and Lee's readers began waiting online for Lee to post the new ones. Lee usually posted his works well after midnight, and Lee's readers began calling themselves [[zombies]], and Lee the [[Necromancer]] summoning them online every night.<ref name="dr" />
Through its 6-month running, ''Dragon Raja'' accumulated 900,000 hits, and its publishing rights were soon taken by [[Golden Bough]], an [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] of Minumsa Publishing Group. Beginning in May 1998, the novel was published in 12 paperback volumes.<ref name="dr" />

In the midst of his debut success, Lee began typing his second novel ''[[Future Walker]]'', a sequel to ''Dragon Raja''. ''Future Walker'' was serialised on the same forum from October 1998 to June 1999, and published in August by Golden Bough in 7 paperback volumes.

Lee continued to use Hitel's serial forum for writing his novels such as ''[[Polaris Rhapsody]]'', ''[[The Bird That Drinks Tears]]'', ''[[The Bird That Drinks Blood]]'' and a few short stories. All of these stories were published upon completion (and deleted from the forum) or collected in later publications by Golden Bough, which remains Lee's publisher today.

This practice of online serialization and getting published based on its popularity (estimated by the work's view counts) surged in fantasy, science, [[romance fiction]] in Korea. Online forums dedicated to these genres opened in hundreds by 2000<ref>{{cite news|publisher=Korean Economics Daily|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhnmode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=102&oid=015&aid=0000000351|title=Click!

Outside the forum he published a short story ''Over the Horizon'' as an [[e-book]] in 2000, and wrote a series of children's stories for RedPen study books published by Kyowon Co. Ltd.

===After Hitel===
The popularization of [[HTTP]] and the [[Web browser]] caused the decline of Hitel and other commercial online services, and Lee's readership on the forum was greatly reduced. But Lee continued to use Hitel forum to 2005, completing ''The Bird That Drinks Blood,'' the last of his multi-volume novels as of July 2014.<ref name="ize">{{cite news|publisher=Yonhap News

After the forum was closed in 2007<ref name="hitel">{{cite web| url = http://user.paran.com/member/| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081202061705/http://user.paran.com/member/| url-status = dead| archive-date = 2 December 2008| title = Announcement of Hitel VT Service's Closure| access-date = 26 August 2011}}</ref> Lee said in an interview that he was searching for a place to serialize his work online, saying that "the realtime feedback from the readers is a big joy, and I miss that feeling."
But he found it difficult to find a replacement to the old text-only forum, which was "easier for [him] to access because [the forum]'s white text on blue limited one's expression to text, 
and it enabled [him] to show individuality purely through words." The web's increased sense of community and of the writer's presence thereby, made it more difficult for him. "I believe words and people are separate," Lee said, "some people may like a writing and want to find about the writer, but I don't."<ref name="yonhap">{{cite news|publisher=Yonhap News

Between 2005 and 2008 Lee wrote several short stories for science fiction magazines, including ''Regarding the Translation of KAIWAPANDOM'' which has been translated into English.<ref name="kaie">{{cite web

There were talks of publishing ''Dragon Raja'' in the United States in 2006, to which Lee's response was "I don't want to disgrace our country."<ref>

Lee's publisher Golden Bough has run an online community from 1999{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} where the publisher and Lee's fans discuss and actively participate in publication of Lee's current and upcoming works. There the publisher ran limited edition campaigns for ''Polaris Rhapsody'' in 2000 and for ''Dragon Raja'' 's 10-year anniversary in 2008. In 2011, a campaign for the new hardback edition for ''Future Walker'' has been announced.<ref name="cafe">{{cite web| url = http://cafe.naver.com/bloodbird/38431| title = Lee Yeongdo Official Publication Cafe| access-date =26 August 2011}}</ref> In 2015, a new hardback edition for ''Polaris Rhapsody'' was released.<ref name="pr hardcover">{{cite web| url = http://goldenbough.minumsa.com/book/1946/| title = Polarid Rhapsody (Hardcover Set)| access-date =18 February 2016}}</ref>

Officially, not much is known about Lee's life outside writing, other than that he helps out at his parent's persimmon farm in his spare time.<ref name="yonhap" />

== Writing (or Typing) ==
Since his debut with ''Dragon Raja'' Lee became known for his prolific writing, publishing 40 books including 6 novels in 7 years. When asked about his speed in writing, Lee said "it just gets written, and once started I can't contain it and sometimes write as much as [29 pages] a day"<ref name="donga1" /> but that "each line after line is hard still" nevertheless.<ref name="yonhap" />

He enjoys intellectual play in his works, constantly twisting words and philosophical concepts. Lee says "the way I like is, even if it becomes difficult, separating what can be separated."<ref name="naver" />

=== Korean fantasy genre ===
Lee is credited as one of the pioneers for [[fantasy literature]] in Korea and its growing acceptance by the literary world, due to the political and philosophical discourse and the huge scale of the created world in his works.<ref name="naver" /><ref name="study" /> His own response to this tends to stay non-opinionated.<ref name="naver" />

Lee is quoted to say that "fantasy is better when read as fantasy." He explains this in a [[Naver]] interview that "treating ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' as a shoddy [[allegory]] to reality and reading it as an example of [[Orientalism]] literature where [[Gandalf]] the 'White' crowns the returned [[Aragorn|king of the 'West']], would leave a lot of the novels to be missed. (If you admit such, almost outrageous logic, because humanity becomes extincts many times [[Kurt Vonnegut]] would be anti-humanism, sadly.)" He explained "fantasy is fantasy, and not the reality's narrow allegories or scary [[simulacra]]; it is neither reality in disguise nor does it expel the reality and take its place." Lee described reading fantasy as "going into fantasy to gain something, or to give something, and we simply return to the reality" giving [[Michael Ende]]'s ''[[The Neverending Story]]'' as a great example for this. Lee also says being "fantastic" has little to do with the quality of a fantasy work.<ref name="naver" />

=== Style and major themes ===

Lee plays on words and heavily uses [[defamiliarization]], often involving [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] conversations among characters. Philosophical discourse plays a major part in the plot of his novels.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Lee's play on words applies to characters' names as well. From ''Dragon Raja'' and ''Future Walker'' [[Karl Heltant]] has a sharp mind and a first name that is a Korean word for knife(칼 ''kal''), while [[Sanson Percival]]'s hands are strong in battle, or ''ssen son''(센 손). Two brothers in ''Polaris Rhapsody'' are named Sopala and Sosara, or Sellcow and Buycow, while another two in ''The Bird That Drinks Blood'' are named Saramal and Paramal, or Buyhorse and Sellhorse.

Lee examines and questions human nature, which affects the destiny of human race in his stories. In ''Dragon Raja'' series the human race is defined by its power and will to cause change. While other races like elves, dwarves and dragons are defined by their characteristics and strength, they are described to lack the ability to change as humans do. Thus human race is empowered to change the world (in human-centered ways) and to cause its time to go on. This power the humanity has over the world is explored in ''Future Walker''. In ''Polaris Rhapsody'' Lee incorporates the humanity's desire for revenge and for freedom in [[feudal]] conflicts and [[pirate]] wars. This conflict of revenge and freedom also involves Highmasters of [[Pandæmonium (Paradise Lost)|Pandamonium]], similar to [[Seven princes of Hell]], who cast a vote to decide the human race's destiny.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Lee's novels also investigate religion and politics. In ''Polaris Rhapsody'' a Church that is similar to Catholic Church in the [[Middle Ages]] coexists with the Highmasters who are heavily involved in the human warfare and politics.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Gods play an essential part in the people's life in ''The Bird That Drinks Tears.'' The novel's title means someone who would drink the tears of others; the ideal ruler who would take away the sorrows of the people.<ref name="digital" /> The concept of an ideal ruler, referred to as "the king(왕), commonly appears in Lee's works. In ''The Bird That Drinks Tears'' the human race is characterized by its search for the king,<ref name="kyunghyang">{{cite news|publisher=Kyunghyang Shinmun

The empire accomplishes peace and order, ruled over by a grand flying capital. The story is told by various characters in different groups, who have different purposes in relation to the empire and its absolute power over people.<ref name="han">{{cite news|publisher=The Hankyoreh
