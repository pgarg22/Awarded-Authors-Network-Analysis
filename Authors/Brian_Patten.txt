His famous works include: "Little Johnny's Confessions", "The irrelevant Song", "Vanishing Trick", "Emma's Doll", "Impossible Parents", amongst others.

==Career==
Patten was born in [[Bootle]], England, near the [[Liverpool]] docks.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Manning |first1=Craig |title=Hot off the bookshelf ... Brian Patten on his book of Upside Down Thinking |url=http://www.wirralglobe.co.uk/news/16273292.hot-off-the-bookshelf-brian-patten-on-his-book-of-upside-down-thinking/ |website=Wirral Globe |accessdate=29 July 2018 |language=en}}</ref> He attended Sefton Park School in the [[Smithdown Road, Liverpool|Smithdown Road]] area of Liverpool, where his early poetic writing was encouraged.<ref name="LiverpoolEcho2013" /> He left school at fifteen and began work for ''The Bootle Times'' writing a column on popular music.

Together with the other two [[Liverpool poets]], [[Roger McGough]] and [[Adrian Henri]], Patten published ''[[The Mersey Sound (anthology)|The Mersey Sound]]'' in 1967.  One of the best-selling poetry anthologies of modern times, ''The Mersey Sound'' aimed to make poetry accessible to a broader audience.  It has been described as ''the most significant anthology of the twentieth century''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Brian Patten - Literature |url=https://literature.britishcouncil.org/writer/brian-patten |website=literature.britishcouncil.org |publisher=The British Council |accessdate=29 July 2018 |language=en}}</ref>  Together with Henri and McGough, Patten was awarded the [[Freedom of the City]] of Liverpool in 2001.<ref>{{cite web |title=Recipients of the Honorary Freedom of the City of Liverpool - Liverpool Town Hall |url=https://www.liverpooltownhall.co.uk/recipients-honorary-freedom-city-liverpool/ |website=Liverpool Town Hall |accessdate=29 July 2018}}</ref>

Patten's first published volumes of poems were ''Little Johnny's Confession'' (1967) and ''Notes to the Hurrying Man'' (1969).  The later collections ''Storm Damage'' (1988) and ''Armada'' (1996) are more varied, the latter featuring a sequence of poems concerning the death of his mother and memories of his childhood. ''Armada'' is perhaps Patten's most mature and formal book, dispensing with much of the playfulness of former work. He has also written comic verse for children, notably ''Gargling With Jelly'' and ''Thawing Frozen Frogs''.

Patten's style is generally [[lyric poetry|lyrical]] and his subjects are primarily love and relationships. His 1981 collection ''Love Poems'' draws together his best work in this area from the previous sixteen years.  [[Charles Causley]] commented that he "reveals a sensibility profoundly aware of the ever-present possibility of the magical and the miraculous, as well as of the granite-hard realities. These are undiluted poems, beautifully calculated, informed - even in their darkest moments - with courage and hope."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Causley |first1=Charles |title=Twentieth-century Children's Writers |date=1978 |publisher=Macmillan International Higher Education |isbn=9781349036486 |pages=979–980 |edition=1st |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_DBdDwAAQBAJ |accessdate=29 July 2018 |language=en}}</ref>

Patten's poem ''So Many Different Lengths of Time'' has in recent times, become a popular poem recited at Funerals. Opening his poem with verse by [[Pablo Neruda]], Patten's poem argues that it is the act of remembrance which offers family members the best antidote to the anguish of loss. In tackling the subject of grief, Patten views poetry as performing an important social function: ‘Poetry helps us understand what we’ve forgotten to remember. It reminds us of things that are important to us when the world overtakes us emotionally.’<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://beyond.life/blog/the-poetry-of-remembrance-pablo-neruda-brian-patten/|title = The Poetry of Remembrance: Pablo Neruda & Brian Patten|date = 12 July 2017}}</ref>
