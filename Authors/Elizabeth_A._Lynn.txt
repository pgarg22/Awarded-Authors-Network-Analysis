==Body of work==

Elizabeth Lynn is an openly lesbian science fiction and fantasy writer who has written numerous works featuring positive gay protagonists.<ref name=Garber84>Garber & Paleo, "Elizabeth A. Lynn: Biographical note" p. 84</ref> Her ''[[Chronicles of Tornor]]'' novels  (1979–80), the first book of which, ''Watchtower'', won the [[World Fantasy Award]], were among the first [[fantasy]] novels to have gay relationships as an unremarkable part of the cultural background, and included explicit and sympathetic depictions of same-sex love.<ref>Garber & Paleo, "A different light" p. 83</ref> The other books in this series are ''The Dancers of Arun'' (1979); and ''Northern Girl'' (1980) – the last of which is of particular lesbian interest.<ref name=lynn/>

Lynn's early science fiction novels were similarly ground-breaking in their treatment of sexual themes.  In ''The Sardonyx Net'' (1981), one of the primary characters is a sexual sadist. Her SF novel ''A Different Light'' (1978) featured a same-sex relationship between two men.<ref>Garber & Paleo, "The Dancers of Arun" p. 83</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/l/elizabeth-a-lynn/ |title=Elizabeth A Lynn |publisher=Fantasticfiction.co.uk |access-date=2008-10-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.locusmag.com/1997/Issues/10/Lynn.html |title=Locus: Elizabeth A.

Lynn more recently began a new fantasy series, again featuring gay relationships: ''Dragon's Winter'' (1998) and ''Dragon's Treasure'' (2004).
