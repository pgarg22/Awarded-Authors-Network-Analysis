'''Dorothy Mae Ann Wordsworth''' (25 December 1771 – 25 January 1855) was an English author, poet, and diarist. She was the sister of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poet [[William Wordsworth]], and the two were close all their adult lives. Dorothy Wordsworth had no ambitions to be a public author, yet she left behind numerous letters, diary entries, topographical descriptions, poems, and other writings.

==Life==
She was born on Christmas Day in [[Cockermouth]], [[Cumberland]], in 1771. Despite the early death of her mother, Dorothy, William and their three brothers had a happy childhood. When in 1783 their father died and the children were sent to live with various relatives, Dorothy was sent alone to live with her aunt, Elizabeth Threlkeld, in [[Halifax, West Yorkshire]].<ref>MacLean, 7</ref> After she was able to be reunited with William, firstly at Racedown Lodge in Dorset in 1795 and afterwards (1797/98) at Alfoxden House in Somerset, they became inseparable companions. The pair lived in poverty at first, and would often beg for cast-off clothes from their friends.<ref name="Cav">Cavendish, Richard. "Death of Dorothy Wordsworth: January 25th, 1855". ''History Today'', Vol. 55, January 3000000</ref>

William wrote of her in his famous [[Lines Written a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey|Tintern Abbey]] poem:

{{poemquote|
Of this fair river; thou my dearest Friend,
My dear, dear Friend; and in thy voice I catch
The language of my former heart, and read
My former pleasures in the shooting lights
Of thy wild eyes ...
My dear, dear Sister!
}}

== Writing ==
Wordsworth was primarily a diarist, and she also wrote poetry though without much interest in becoming an established poet. "I should detest the idea of setting myself up as an author," she once wrote, "give Wm. the P
sure of it."<ref>De Selincourt, Ernest (ed.). "The Letters of William and Dorothy Wordsworth, vol. 2". Oxford, England: Clarendon Press, 1967. 454</ref> She almost published her travel account with William to Scotland in 1803 ''[[Recollections of a Tour Made in Scotland]]'', but a publisher was not found<ref>De Selincourt, vii</ref> and it would not be published until 1874.

She wrote a very early account of an ascent of [[Scafell Pike]] in 1818, climbing the mountain in the company of her friend Mary Barker, Miss Barker's maid, and two local people to act as guide and porter. Dorothy's work was used in 1822 by her brother William, unattributed, in his popular guide book to the [[Lake District]] – and this was then copied by [[Harriet Martineau]] in her equally successful guide<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/completeguidetoe1855mart#page/158/mode/2up Summit of Scawfell, pp. 158–159]</ref> (in its fourth edition by 1876), but with attribution, if only to William Wordsworth. The account was quoted in other guidebooks as well. Consequently, this story was very widely read by the many visitors to the Lake District over more than half of the 19th century.<ref>[http://www.pastpresented.ukart.com/eskdale/wordsworth1.htm Dorothy Wordsworth's ascent of Scafell Pike, 1818]</ref>
<!-- the remark about the lack of attribution by William of his sister's work is an important part of this paragraph. See also in this article the quote from the Grasmere Journal and its reminiscence of her brother's poem Daffodils-->

She never married, and after William married Mary Hutchinson in 1802, she continued to live with them. She was by now 31 and thought of herself as too old for marriage. In 1829 she fell seriously ill and was to remain an invalid for the remainder of her life. She died at eighty-three in 1855 near [[Ambleside]], having spent the past twenty years in, according to the biographer Richard Cavendish, "a deepening haze of senility".<ref name="Cav"/>

Her ''Grasmere Journal'' was published in 1897, edited by [[William Angus Knight]]. The journal eloquently described her day-to-day life in the Lake District, long walks she and her brother took through the countryside, and detailed portraits of literary lights of the early 19th century, including [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[Sir Walter Scott]], [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]] and [[Robert Southey]], a close friend who popularised the fairytale ''[[Goldilocks and the Three Bears]]''.

The ''Grasmere Journal'' and Wordsworth's other works revealed how vital she was to her brother's success. William relied on her detailed accounts of nature scenes and borrowed freely from her journals. For example;

{{Quote|I never saw daffodils so beautiful they grew among the mossy stones about & about them, some rested their heads upon these stones as on a pillow for weariness & the rest tossed & reeled & danced & seemed as if they verily laughed with the wind that blew upon them over the Lake, they looked so gay ever glancing ever changing|sign=Dorothy Wordsworth|source=''Grasmere Journal'' 15 April 1802<ref>[https://wordsworth.org.uk/dorothyjournal.html Dorothy's Journal. Wordsworth Trust]</ref>{{sfn|Wordsworth|1802}}}}

This passage is clearly brought to mind when reading William's 'Daffodils', where her brother, in this poem of two years later, describes what appears to be the shared experience in the journal as his own solitary observation. Her observations and descriptions have been considered to be as poetic if not more so than those of her brother.{{sfn|Ellacombe|1884|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=autIAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA76 Daffofils p. 76]}} In her time she was described as being one of the few writers who have lived who could have provided so vivid and picturesque a scene.{{sfn|LQR|1853|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SJTfAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA112 Memoirs of Wordsworth, Issue 183, January, p. 112]}}

== Critical reception ==
Dorothy Wordsworth's works came to light just as literary critics were beginning to re-examine [[Feminist literary criticism|women's role in literature]]. The success of the ''Grasmere Journal'' led to a renewed interest in Wordsworth,<ref>Polowetzky, Michael. "Prominent Sisters: Mary Lamb, Dorothy Wordsworth, and Sarah Disraeli". Westport CT: Greenwood, 1996. 66</ref> and several other journals and collections of her letters have since been published. Scholar Anne Mellor has identified Wordsworth as demonstrating a 'model of affiliation rather than a model of individual achievement',<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qZ5FAAAAQBAJ&q=Mellor+Dorothy+Wordsworth|title=Romanticism and Gender|last=Mellor|first=Anne K.|date=6 August 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136040306|language=en}}</ref><sup>:186</sup> more commonly associated with [[Romanticism]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Common Ground : Democracy and Collectivity in an Age of Individualism|last=Gilbert, Jeremy, 1971-|isbn=9781849649766|location=London|oclc=868914828}}</ref><sup>:32-33</sup>
