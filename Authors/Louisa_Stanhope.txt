'''Louisa Sidney Stanhope''' (fl. 1806–1827) was an English [[novelist]] of the early 19th century. She wrote mainly [[Historical romance|historical]] and [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] romances in profusion, counting as Britain's tenth most productive novelist in the 1800–1829 period.<ref>''The Cambridge Companion to Fiction in the Romantic Period'', ed. Richard Maxwell, Katie Trumpener, 2008, p. 17.</ref> Her didactic novels were aimed mainly at younger female readers.

==Delicacy and strength==
A scholar notes of ''The Age We Live In'' (1809) and ''Runnemede'' (1825) (and by implication of the others) that they are didactic novels aimed at younger female readers, for it was, in Stanhope's words, "requisite to pamper the insatiate palate of romance-readers; else would the page be cast aside, and the poor author stigmatized with dullness and insipidity." Her characters maintain a balance of feminine delicacy and strength of mind.<ref>Dawn Davis: "An Essay on the Work of Louisa Sidney Stanhope" [http://extra.shu.ac.uk/corvey/corinne/essay%20davis.html Retrieved 7 November 2012.]</ref>
