'''Philip Lamantia''' (October 23, 1927 – March 7, 2005) was an American [[poet]] and lecturer. His poems were often [[visionary]], ecstatic, terror-filled, and erotic, exploring the subconscious world of dreams and linking it to daily experiences, while sometimes incorporating typographical arrangements a la [[concrete poetry]]. He has posthumously been regarded as "the most visionary poet of the American [[postwar]] generation".<ref name="collectedpoems">{{Cite book

==Biography==
Lamantia was born in [[San Francisco]] to Sicilian immigrants, and was raised in the city's [[Excelsior District|Excelsior]] neighborhood. His poetry was first published in ''[[View (magazine)|View magazine]]'' in 1943, when he was fifteen, and in the final issue of the [[Surrealist]] magazine ''[[VVV (magazine)|VVV]]'' the following year. In 1944 he dropped out of [[Balboa High School (San Francisco)|Balboa High School]] to pursue poetry in [[New York City]].<ref name="HAMLIN">

He appeared in [[Maya Deren]]'s [[At Land]] (1944), a 15-minute silent experimental film.

Lamantia was one of the post World War II poets now sometimes referred to as the San Francisco Renaissance, and later became involved with the San Francisco [[Beat Generation]] poets and the [[Surrealist Movement in the United States]]. He was on the bill at San Francisco's [[Six Gallery reading|Six Gallery]] on October 7, 1955, when poet [[Allen Ginsberg]] read his poem ''[[Howl]]'' for the first time. At this event Lamantia chose to read the poems of John Hoffman, a friend who had recently died. Hoffman's poetry collection ''Journey to the End'' (which includes the poems that Lamantia read at the Six Gallery) was published by [[City Lights Bookstore]] in 2008, bound together with Lamantia's own ''Tau,'' a poem-cycle also dating from  the mid-fifties. ''Tau'' remained unpublished during Lamantia's lifetime.

Lamantia was also known for his journeys with [[Indigenous peoples|native peoples]] in the United States and Mexico in the 1950s, participating in the [[peyote]]-eating rituals of the [[Washoe people|Washo]] Indians of [[Nevada]] which often inspired his poems. In later life, he embraced Catholicism, the religion of his childhood, and wrote many poems on Catholic themes.

[[Nancy Peters]], his wife and literary editor, said of Lamantia, "He found in the narcotic night world a kind of modern counterpart to the Gothic castle -- a zone of peril to be symbolically or existentially crossed."
