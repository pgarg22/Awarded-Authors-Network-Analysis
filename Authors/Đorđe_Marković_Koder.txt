'''Đorđe Marković Koder''' ([[Cyrillic]]: Ђорђе Марковић Кодер) (1806 – April 30, 1891) was a [[Serbs|Serbian]] poet born in [[Austrian Empire]]. Misunderstood, largely forgotten and often considered a marginal figure in Serbian poetry, criticized for his cryptic style littered with incomprehensible words and obscure metaphors, Koder was nevertheless a unique phenomenon in the 19th century [[Serbian literature]], sometimes cited as the first Serbian [[modernism|modernist]].<ref name="Ž.

==Biography==

Đorđe Marković Koder was, by his own account, born in 1806 in the village of [[Vizić]] or Bingula, in [[Fruška gora]], present-day Serbia. Soon after that his family moved to [[Sremska Mitrovica]], where his father worked as a [[merchant]] and ran a [[general store]]. After finishing German elementary school in Mitrovica, Koder was sent to [[Szeged]], Hungary, where he finished [[Piarists|Piarist]] high school. In 1831 he graduated from the two-year [[Protestant]] law school, where he found a job as a [[fencing]] instructor with the army.

In 1837 Koder obtained a passport with the aim of going to [[Istanbul]], via [[Bucharest]] and [[Athens]]. However, as he didn't manage to raise the money for the journey, he was compelled to move to [[Trieste]], where his brother Jovan worked as an accountant for an American company.<ref name="Pismo Mariji Milutinović">Pismo Kodera Mariji Milutinović, 1837, Matica Srpska, Novi Sad, sign. 21718</ref> He lived in a poor suburb of Trieste, dedicating his time to writing and trying to procure a job. He corresponded with his relative Marija Popović-Punktatorka, the soon-to-be wife of [[Sima Milutinović Sarajlija]]. As he failed in the latter, in 1838 he moved back to [[Szeged]] and then [[Budapest]], where he attended university lectures in various disciplines, such as medicine, [[astronomy]] and [[aesthetics]]. At the same time he tried to learn and perfect multiple languages – English, French, Greek and [[Sanskrit]].

In 1839 Koder suddenly decided to move to [[Kragujevac]], Serbia, where he became a fencing and gymnastics instructor for Mihailo and Milan, the sons of prince [[Miloš Obrenović]]. He also worked as an interpreter for the prince. When Miloš Obrenović abdicated from power, in June 1839, Koder moved to [[Belgrade]], where he worked at odd jobs until he managed to open a fencing school in 1844. The funding for the school was provided by Jovan Ninić, a wealthy Serbian [[Patriotism|patriot]] from Belgrade.<ref name="Danica">Zagrebački list ''"Danica"'', broj 16, 20. april 1844, rubrika ''"Vesti iz Beograda"''</ref> One year later Koder returned to Szeged, then to [[Timișoara]], then back to Belgrade, where he found a house in the poor suburb of [[Palilula, Belgrade|Palilula]] and became friends with [[Jakov Ignjatović]], a famous Serbian novelist and prose writer, and writer Milan Savić. Both Savić and Ignjatović left vivid reminiscences of him in their respective memoirs.

In 1852, Serbian magazine ''Svetovid'', from Timișoara, published two Koder's poems: ''Grlica'' (Turtle Dove) and ''Leptir'' (Butterfly).<ref name="Svetovid">Časopis "Svetovid", broj 4, 12. jul 1852, Leptir Đ. M. Kodera</ref> In September 1858 he had almost completed his master poem, ''Romoranka'', for which he unsuccessfully tried to organize a public reading in Belgrade.<ref name="S. Vojinović">Pokušaj Đ. Markovića da u Beogradu 1858. godine pročita i objavi spev ''Romoranka'', Književne novine, LIII, 2000, No. 1007-1008</ref> In a Letter to his relative Marija Popović-Milutinović (better known as Punktatorka) we read that he is about to finish ''Romoranka'', about to write ''Tolkovka'' as an addition to it, and that he was about to write another book called ''Milogorka i Devesilje.''  Next month he got a permanent job as a fighting instructor in the Artillery School in Belgrade, and in 1859 he applied for Serbian [[citizenship]]. He continued his work on ''Romoranka'', and in 1860 published an advertisement calling for subscribers.<ref name="Srpske novine">Srpske novine, broj XXVII 4, 5. januar 1860</ref>

When a series of uprisings against the Ottoman government broke out in [[Montenegro]] and [[Herzegovina]] in 1861, Serbian government sent Đorđe Marković Koder as an emissary and a negotiator between warring sides, carrying letters on the behalf of the European Commission.<ref name="Građa za istoriju veze Crne Gore i Hercegovine od 1852">Građa za istoriju veze Crne Gore i Hercegovine od 1852, Zapisi, Knjiga XII, str. 120-121</ref> Marković's role in the negotiations remains unclear and the historical data are scarce.

In 1861. Koder moved to [[Novi Sad]], where he managed to publish a couple of his poems in the magazines ''Danica'' and ''Javor'', the latter edited by [[Jovan Jovanović Zmaj]].<ref>List "Javor", broj 22, 10. avgust 1862, Novi Sad</ref> His main poem, ''Romoranka'', which integrated and extended many of the motives exhibited in his previous poems, was finally published in September 1862.

Milka Grgurova, an actress from Novi Sad, left a vivid account of her visit to Koder's rented room, shown in by the poet's landlady as he was not at home at the time of the visit. Her account gives us an interesting insight into his lifestyle.

''"When we entered the room… The things that we saw! First we heard a piglet, that came right to us. It probably thought that its master, Koder, had come home. White rabbits, chicken, ducklings and whatnot! And all that crowd greeted us with much noise and affection. All that four-legged and feathery two-legged company lived in perfect harmony. What's more, the whole [[menagerie]] lived with Koder, in a single room furnished in a very original way. In one corner there was a bed, with straw mat covered by a thick blanket. By the window there was a simple merchant's chest, which he used as a writing desk, on top of which there was a whole mess of papers, books, goose quilts and an earthen [[inkstand]]. In the mess I could discern a book titled ''Romoranka'', which he later gave me as a gift, as well as some poems by [[Branko Radičević]]"'' .<ref name="Milka Grgurova">"Đorđe Marković Koder", Staniša Vojinović, Narodna knjiga, Beograd, 2005, str. 94</ref>

After publishing ''Romoranka'', Marković left Novi Sad for Istanbul, where he spent a couple of years working as an interpreter for various embassies. In 1867 he was back in Timosoara. A letter has been preserved, written to him by Dragiša Milutinović, to inform Koder that the book ''"A Grammar of the Persian Language"'' had been procured and sent to him, as he had requested.<ref name="Pismo1">Pismo, Rukopisno odeljenje Matice Srpske, sign. 35985, Novi Sad</ref> In February 1868 he undertook a long journey around Italy, after which he returned to Bucharest and then to Timișoara, where he continued studying [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]], planning to translate ''Romoranka'' to the latter.<ref name="Pismo2">Jedno neštampano pismo brata Đorđa Markovića Kodera Mariji Milutinović, Zbornik Matice srpske za KJ, 1985, knj. XXXIII, sv. 2, 441-442.</ref> In May 1872 he returned to Istanbul, where he got a job at the [[British embassy]]. As an interpreter for Arabic and Turkish, he went on a number of missions with the British embassy staff, including at least one journey to northern Africa.<ref name="Koder">"Đorđe Marković Koder", Staniša Vojinović, Narodna knjiga, Beograd, 2005</ref>

Some 16 years later, when most of his friends had believed he had been long dead, he suddenly returned to Novi Sad in 1888. Despite his age (82) he was in good health. He stayed with his friend Đoka Kamber, whom he informed that he had come to Novi Sad to die and be buried there.<ref name="Naše Doba">"Đoka Marković", Stevan Pavlović, list ''"Naše doba"'', broj 11, 19. februar 1888.</ref> In 1890 he lived in "Ubogi dom", a refuge for [[homelessness|homeless people]] in Novi Sad. There he surrounded himself with a number of cats and dogs, which he had befriended. He died on April 30, 1891.

==Work==

Đorđe Marković Koder was an active and relatively prolific writer, even though he only managed to publish one book, ''Romoranka'', containing his 10.000 verses long poem together with the author's notes and explanations. His four other long poems – ''San Matere Srbske, Devesilje, Mitologije and Iskoni'' – were collected and published in 1979 by Božo Vukadinović, in a book titled ''Spevovi''. He also wrote ''Slovar'', a dictionary aimed at expounding and clarifying the notions used in his poetry. It was published in 2005 by Narodna biblioteka "Vuk Karadžić".<ref name="Mitološki rečnik">Mitološki Rečnik, Đorđe Marković Koder, Narodna biblioteka "Vuk Karadžić", Kragujevac, 2005, {{ISBN|86-83007-18-9}}</ref>

In his attempt to explain and describe his vision of the world by means of poetry, Koder had to construct a number of notions and corresponding terms. Most of his terminology is based on [[Serbian language]], but derivatives of foreign words were also used, as well as a number of archaisms, compound nouns and words whose meaning can be inferred from the sound rather than the [[semantics]]. His dictionary contains most of his terminology, but many notions were explained using other incomprehensible constructs, obscure wording or recursive definitions. What's more, the dictionary does not follow [[alphabetical order]], which makes it even more complicated to comprehend. Some of the definitions in the dictionary were given in different languages, while some terms were explained by drawings and mathematical formulas.

Koder's personal [[mythology]] often features various species of plants and birds, as well as dreams, spirits, fairies and cosmical forces, whose complex interplay forms the very basis of our existence. Even though generally coherent and consistent in itself, his work is extremely hermetic and self-contained, almost impenetrable even to the most educated readers.

==Criticism==

When it was published, in 1862, ''Romoranka'' attracted some attention in Serbian literary circles in Novi Sad and Belgrade, but the main problem with it was that hardly anyone could understand what it was about. Even though Koder claimed to have used the words he learned from old women and peasants all around Serbia, it is possible that many of those words were actually invented by himself. ''Romoranka'' was described by Jovan Jovanović Zmaj as "incomprehensible, obscure and impossible to understand, despite the explanations that comprise one third of the book."<ref>List "Javor", broj 26, 15. septembar 1862, kolumna "Nek se zna", autor J. Jovanović Zmaj</ref>

[[Jovan Skerlić]], a prominent Serbian [[literary critic]] of the time, described Koder's ''Romoranka'' as "the most insane book of our romanticism, a blurry symbolic description of lives of birds and plants." Koder's "preposterous language" was, according to Skerlić, "a sickly original vocabulary", and his whole opus could only be described as "the jester's hat on the head of Serbian literature".<ref name="Jovan Skerlić">Jovan Skerlić, Omladina i njena književnost, Beograd, 1906, 416-418</ref>
