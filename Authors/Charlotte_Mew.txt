'''Charlotte Mary Mew''' (15 November 1869 – 24 March 1928) was an English poet whose work spans the eras of [[Victorian literature|Victorian]] poetry and [[Modernism]].

==Early life and education==
[[File:Charlotte Mew (Marchmont Association).jpg|thumb|right|The [[blue plaque]] at 30 [[Doughty Street]], where she was born{{r|Copus}}]]
Mew was born in [[Bloomsbury]], [[London]], the daughter of Anna Maria Kendall and the architect Frederick Mew, who designed [[Hampstead Town Hall]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol9/pp130-138|title=Hampstead: Local Government &#124; British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk}}</ref><ref>Warner, Val, ed. ''Collected Poems and Selected Prose of Charlotte Mews''. New York: Routledge, 2003, p. ix.</ref> The marriage produced seven children. Charlotte, nicknamed Lotti by her family, attended Gower Street School, where she was greatly influenced by the school's headmistress, [[Lucy Harrison]],<ref>Copus, Julia, ''This Rare Spirit: A Life of Charlotte Mew''. London: Faber, 2021, pp. 46–9.</ref> and attended lectures at [[University College London]].<ref>[[Dale Spender|Spender, Dale]], and Janet Todd, eds, ''British Women Writers: An Anthology from the Fourteenth Century to the Present''. New York: Bedrick Books, 1989, p. 695.</ref> Her father died in 1898 without making adequate provision for his family; two of her siblings suffered from [[mental illness]] and were committed to [[mental institution|institutions]],<ref>Copus, Julia, ''This Rare Spirit: A Life of Charlotte Mew''. London: Faber, 2021.</ref> and three others died in early childhood, leaving Charlotte, her mother, and her sister Anne. Charlotte and Anne made a pact never to marry for fear of passing on insanity to their children. (One author speculates that Charlotte was "almost certainly chastely [[lesbian]]".)<ref name="rice">{{Cite book |title=A New Matrix for Modernism: A Study of the Lives and Poetry of Charlotte Mew and Anna Wickham |first=Nelljean McConeghey |last=Rice |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-94140-7 |page=35 }}</ref> Mew had a strong sense of style: her friend and editor Alida Monro remembers her wearing distinctive red worsted stockings in the winter months, and she insisted on buying her black, button-up boots (in a tiny size 2) from Pinet's bootmakers in Mayfair; items left to different friends in her will (such as a 'small three drop diamond pendant' and a 'scarlet Chinese embroidered scarf') also suggest a keen interest in fashion.<ref>Copus, Julia, ''This Rare Spirit: A Life of Charlotte Mew''. London: Faber, 2021, p. 110.</ref> In later years, she often dressed in masculine attire, adopting the appearance of a dandy.<ref>Rice, p. 6.</ref>

==Writing career==

In 1894, Mew succeeded in getting a short story published in ''[[The Yellow Book]].''<ref>{{cite book|last=Mew |first=Charlotte M.|title=Passed|publisher=Elkin Mathews & John Lane|location=London|year=1894|series=The Yellow Book|volume=2|pages=121–41|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Yellow_Book/Volume_2/Passed}}</ref> Entitled ''Passed'' its inspiration derived from Mew's activities as a volunteer social worker and concerns a sex worker, who leads the narrator to a room where the sex worker's sister lies dead.  The narrator is profoundly shocked by the experience, but flees in the end to her comfortable life. Yet, she is later confronted by the woman again, accompanied by a man, and this causes the narrator to break down.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/charlotte-mew|title=Charlotte Mew|first=Poetry|last=Foundation|date=20 October 2020|website=Poetry Foundation}}</ref> Five years followed without any publications, but by the beginning of the 20th century she was contributing fiction with some regularity to magazines, including ''Temple Bar.''<ref>Fitzgerald, ''Charlotte Mew and Her Friends'' (New York, 1988), p. 66.</ref> She apparently wrote very little poetry until the 1910s. Her first collection, ''[[The Farmer's Bride]]'', was published in 1916 in chapbook format by the [[Poetry Bookshop]]; in the United States this collection was entitled ''Saturday Market'' and published in 1921 by [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan]]. It earned her the admiration of [[Sydney Cockerell]] and drew popular respect for her as a poet.<ref>Fitzgerald, ''Charlotte Mew and Her Friends'' (New York, 1988), p. 102.</ref>

Her poems are varied: some of them (such as "Madeleine in Church") are passionate discussions of faith and the possibility of belief in God; others are proto-[[modernism|modernist]] in form and atmosphere ("[[In Nunhead Cemetery]]"). She made experimental use of long, prose-like lines, and varieties of enjambment and indentation, which has been praised for its originality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2019/dec/23/poem-of-the-week-not-for-that-city-by-charlotte-mew|title=Poem of the week: Not for That City by Charlotte Mew|first=Carol|last=Rumens|date=23 December 2019|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>  Many of her poems are in the form of [[dramatic monologue]]s, and she often wrote from the point of view of a male persona ("[[The Farmer's Bride]]"). Two concern mental illness - "Ken" and "[[On the Asylum Road]]". Many of Mew's poems, including "Ken", "The Farmer's Bride", and "Saturday Market", are about outcast figures, expressing Mew's feelings of alienation from the community in which she lived.<ref>Fitzgerald, ''Charlotte Mew and Her Friends'' (New York, 1988), p. 139.</ref> Her poem "The Trees Are Down" is a poignant plea for ecological sensitivity and is singled out particularly in the anthology ''The Green Book of Poetry'' by [[Ivo Mosley]].

Mew gained the patronage of several literary figures, notably [[Thomas Hardy]], who called her the best woman poet of her day; [[Virginia Woolf]], who said she was "very good and interesting and quite unlike anyone else";<ref>Fitzgerald, ''Charlotte Mew and Her Friends'' (New York, 1988), p. 180.</ref> and [[Siegfried Sassoon]]. In 1923, she obtained a [[Civil List]] pension of £75 per year with the aid of Cockerell, Hardy, [[John Masefield]], and [[Walter de la Mare]].<ref>Rice, Nelljean McConeghey (2003). ''A New Matrix for Modernism: A Study of the Lives and Poetry of Charlotte Mew and Anna Wickham''. Routledge, p. 35.</ref> This helped ease her financial difficulties.

==Decline and death==

After the death of her sister from cancer in 1927, she descended into a deep depression and was admitted to a nursing home where she died by suicide<ref>{{cite web|last=Warner|first=Val|date=|title=Mary Magdalene and the Bride: The Work of Charlotte Mew|url=https://www.pnreview.co.uk/cgi-bin/scribe?item_id=4142|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=2 June 2009|website=}}</ref> <ref>[https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/charlotte-mew Poetry Foundation biography]</ref>from drinking [[Lysol]], a disinfectant.<ref>["https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/this-rare-spirit-life-charlotte-mew-julia-copus-review-andrew-motion/ Dreams that take my breath" By Andrew Motion] ''Times Literary Supplement'' 16 April 2021 </ref>
