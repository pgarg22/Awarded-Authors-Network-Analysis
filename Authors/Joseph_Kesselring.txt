'''Joseph Otto Kesselring''' (June 21 1900 <ref>1</ref> &ndash; November 5, 1967) was an American playwright who was best known for writing ''[[Arsenic and Old Lace (play)|Arsenic and Old Lace]]'', a hit on Broadway from 1939 to 1944 and in other countries as well.

==Biography==
He was born in New York City to Henry and Frances Kesselring. His father's parents were immigrants from Germany. His mother was an English Canadian.<ref>US Census 1920, New York Borough of Manhattan, enumeration district 913, Sheet 19A</ref>  Kesselring spent much of his life in and around the theater. In 1922, he began teaching vocal music and directed stage productions at [[Bethel College (Kansas)|Bethel College]], a [[Mennonite]] school in [[North Newton, Kansas|North Newton]], [[Kansas]]. After two years, Kesselring left teaching and returned to the stage, working for two years with an amateur theatrical group in [[Niagara, New York|Niagara]], [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref>[http://www.methactoncommunitytheater.org/ars_res.htm Dramaturgy: Notes from the Director] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513233410/http://www.methactoncommunitytheater.org/ars_res.htm |date=May 13, 2008 }}, Methacton Community Theater website. Retrieved February 19, 2010.</ref> He began working as a freelance [[playwright]] in 1933, completing 12 original plays, of which four were produced on Broadway: ''[[There's Wisdom in Women]]'' (1935), "Cross-Town" (1937), ''Arsenic and Old Lace'' (1939), and ''Four Twelves are 48'' (1951).  ''[[Arsenic and Old Lace (play)|Arsenic and Old Lace]]'' was his masterpiece. It ran for 1444 performances on Broadway and 1337 performances in London, and became a staple in high school and [[dinner theater]] circuits. [[Arsenic and Old Lace (film)|The 1944 movie adaptation]] was also a comedy hit.

''Arsenic and Old Lace'' appeared at a time of strong isolationist sentiment regarding European affairs, of the sort that was very strong where Kesselring went to college. The play suggested that the elite running America had a murderous heritage.<ref>{{cite book|author=Matthew C.

Kesselring was an Episcopalian who did not fit in well with the straight-laced college. He dropped out of college in 1924.<ref>See [http://mennonitelife.bethelks.edu/2013/05/another-look-joseph-kesselring-bethel-college-and-the-origins-of-arsenic-and-old-lace/  Keith L.
