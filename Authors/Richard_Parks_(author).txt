==Works==
Parks "started writing seriously about 1976,"<ref name="Hoover"/><ref name="RP"/> collecting thirty-five rejections before his first professional sale ("The Passing," published in ''[[Amazing Stories|Amazing/Fantastic]]'', v. 28, no. 1, July, 1981).<ref name="RP"/> His work since then has appeared in ''[[Asimov's Science Fiction]]'', ''[[Beneath Ceaseless Skies]]'', ''[[Fantasy Magazine]]'', ''[[Realms of Fantasy]]'', ''[[Tor.com]]'', ''[[Weird Tales]]'' and other periodicals, as well as various anthologies. Early in his career "[h]is most popular recurring character [was] Eli Mothersbaugh, a high-tech ghost hunter based in the sleepy—and oft haunted—imaginary town of Canemill, Mississippi."<ref name="Hoover"/> Many of his fantasies with contemporary settings also make use of Canemill, and its name has been adopted for Canemill Publishing, an imprint through which Parks has issued a number of his books. More recently he has found success with his historical fantasies featuring Yamada no Goji, a demon hunter of [[Heian period]] [[Japan]].

==Reception==
[[Parke Godwin]] called Parks's first collection, ''[[The Ogre's Wife|The Ogre's Wife: Fairy Tales For Grownups]]'' (2002), "one of the best SF/fantasy collections I've read in years" and wrote of its author that "[l]ike any fine writer [he] doesn't label easily, which makes him hell for lazy-minded pigeonholers, but his themes are consistent and clear. He uses fantasy to underscore reality: the nature of our humanity and the inescapability of what we are, the choices we make and the price we pay for each, right or wrong. ... [H]e can step imperceptibly from deadpan funny to deeply affecting truth with an utterly transparent style that has the reader racing down the page [and] has the rare ability to say profound things simply."<ref name="Godwin">Godwin, Parke. "THE OGRE'S WIFE: Ghosts, Gods, a Dragon, Assorted Legends and Things That Go Bump in the Heart: An Introduction." In ''The Ogre's Wife: Fairy Tales For Grownups'', Obscura Press, 2002.</ref>

[[Charles de Lint]] of ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction]]'' praised Parks' "remarkable storytelling" in a voice that is, "sometimes lyrical, sometimes hard-edged; sometimes in a voice that sounds as ancient as the first stories told around our early ancestors' campfires; sometimes in a voice so new that we have yet to hear it."<ref name="DeLintOgre">{{cite news|last1=deLint|first1=Charles|title=The Ogre's Wife and Other Fairy Tales for Grown-Ups|publisher=[[Fantasy & Science Fiction]]|date=August 2002|id={{ProQuest|219675409}}}}</ref>

==Recognition==
