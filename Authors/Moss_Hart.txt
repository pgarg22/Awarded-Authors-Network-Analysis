'''Moss Hart''' (October 24, 1904 – December 20, 1961) was an American playwright, librettist, and theatre director.

==Early years==
Hart was born in [[New York City]], the son of Lillian (Solomon) and Barnett Hart, a cigar maker.<ref>1910 United States Federal Census</ref><ref>1920 United States Federal Census</ref> He had a younger brother, Bernard.<ref>1930 United States Federal Census</ref> He grew up in relative poverty with his English-born [[Jewish]] immigrant parents in [[the Bronx]] and in [[Sea Gate, Brooklyn]].<ref>[http://www.enotes.com/you-cant/author-biography Moss Hart profile: the early years]</ref> He was the great-grandson of the Jewish bare-knuckle pugilist [[Barney Aaron]].

Early on he had a strong relationship with his Aunt Kate, with whom he later lost contact due to a falling out between her and his parents, and Kate's weakening mental state. She piqued his interest in the theater and took him to see performances often. Hart even went so far as to create an "alternate ending" to her life in his book ''[[Act One (book)|Act One]]''. He writes that she died while he was working on out-of-town tryouts for ''The Beloved Bandit.'' Later, <!--after resurrection?  Does someone care to make sense of this?--> Kate became eccentric and then disturbed, [[vandalism|vandalizing]] Hart's home, writing threatening letters and setting fires backstage during rehearsals for ''[[Jubilee (musical)|Jubilee]]''. But his relationship with her was formative. He learned that the theater made possible "the art of being somebody else … not a scrawny boy with bad teeth, a funny name … and a mother who was a distant drudge."<ref name=bach>{{cite book|last1=Bach|first1=Steven|author-link1=Steven Bach|title=Dazzler: The Life and Times of Moss Hart|publisher=Random House Inc|pages=1, 13, 268|year=2001|isbn=0-679-44154-9|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/b/bach-01dazzler.html|access-date=2008-05-28}}</ref>

==Career==
[[File:Kaufman-Hart-1937.jpg|thumb|left|[[George S. Kaufman]] and Moss Hart in 1937]]
After working several years as a director of amateur theatrical groups and an entertainment director at summer resorts, he scored his first Broadway hit with ''[[Once in a Lifetime (play)|Once in a Lifetime]]'' (1930), a farce about the arrival of the sound era in Hollywood. The play was written in collaboration with Broadway veteran [[George S. Kaufman]], who regularly wrote with others, notably [[Marc Connelly]] and [[Edna Ferber]]. (Kaufman also performed in the play's original Broadway cast in the role of a frustrated playwright hired by Hollywood.) During the next decade, Kaufman and Hart teamed on a string of successes, including ''[[You Can't Take It with You (play)|You Can't Take It with You]]'' (1936) and ''[[The Man Who Came to Dinner]]'' (1939). Though Kaufman had hits with others, Hart is generally conceded to be his most important collaborator.

''You Can't Take It With You'', the story of an eccentric family and how they live during the [[Great Depression|Depression]], won the 1937 Pulitzer Prize for drama. It is Hart's most-revived play. When director [[Frank Capra]] and writer [[Robert Riskin]] adapted it for the screen in 1938, the film won the Best Picture Oscar and Capra won for Best Director.

''The Man Who Came To Dinner'' is about the caustic Sheridan Whiteside who, after injuring himself slipping on ice, must stay in a [[Midwest]]ern family's house. The character was based on Kaufman and Hart's friend, critic [[Alexander Woollcott]]. Other characters in the play are based on [[Noël Coward]], [[Harpo Marx]] and [[Gertrude Lawrence]].

Throughout the 1930s, Hart worked both with and without Kaufman on several musicals and revues, including ''[[Face the Music (musical)|Face the Music]]'' (1932); ''[[As Thousands Cheer]]'' (1933), with songs by [[Irving Berlin]]; ''[[Jubilee (musical)]]'' (1935), with songs by [[Cole Porter]]; and ''[[I'd Rather Be Right]]'' (1937), with songs by [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Lorenz Hart]]. (Lorenz Hart and Moss Hart were not related.) 
After ''[[George Washington Slept Here]]'' (1940), Kaufman and Hart called it quits. Hart continued to write plays after parting with Kaufman, such as ''[[Christopher Blake (play)|Christopher Blake]]'' (1946) and ''Light Up the Sky'' (1948), as well as the book for the musical ''[[Lady In The Dark]]'' (1941), with songs by [[Kurt Weill]] and [[Ira Gershwin]]. However, he became best known during this period as a director. Among the Broadway hits he staged were ''[[Junior Miss]]'' (1941), ''[[Dear Ruth]]'' (1944) and ''[[Anniversary Waltz]]'' (1954).  By far his biggest hit was the musical ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' (1956), adapted from [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'', with book and lyrics by [[Alan Jay Lerner]] and music by [[Frederick Loewe]]. The show ran over six years and won a Tony Award for Best Musical. Hart picked up the Tony for Best Director.<ref>{{cite news |title=Internet Broadway Database|work=IBDB|author= IBDB.com|access-date=October 5, 2020| url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/my-fair-lady-2407}}</ref>
[[File:Moss Hart Arlene Francis Answer Yes or No 1950.JPG|thumb|Hart was the host of an early television game show, ''Answer Yes or No'', in 1950. [[Arlene Francis]] was one of the panelists.]]
Hart also wrote some screenplays, including ''[[Gentleman's Agreement]]'' (1947) – for which he received an Oscar nomination – ''[[Hans Christian Andersen (film)|Hans Christian Andersen]]'' (1952) and ''[[A Star Is Born (1954 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' (1954). He wrote a memoir, ''[[Act One (book)|Act One]]: An Autobiography by Moss Hart'', which was released in 1959. It was adapted to ''[[Act One (film)|film]]'' in 1963, with [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]] portraying Hart. The last show Hart directed was the [[Lerner and Loewe]] musical ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]'' (1960). During a troubled out-of-town tryout, Hart had a heart attack. The show opened before he fully recovered, but he and Lerner reworked it after the opening. That, along with huge pre-sales and a cast performance on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', helped ensure the expensive production was a hit. {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Guild presidency==
Hart was the tenth president of the [[Dramatists Guild of America]], from 1947 until 1956, when [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] became his successor.

==Personal life==
Hart married [[Kitty Carlisle]] on August 10, 1946; they had two children.<ref>{{cite book| last1=Brenner| first1=Marie| author-link1=Marie Brenner| title=Great Dames: What I Learned From Older Women| url=https://archive.org/details/greatdameswhatil00bren| url-access=registration| year=2000| publisher=Crown| location=New York| isbn=978-0609807095| pages=[https://archive.org/details/greatdameswhatil00bren/page/12 12–34]| chapter=Kitty Carlisle Hart}}</ref>

===Moss Hart and Kitty Carlisle Hart New Play Initiative===

Developed as an offshoot of the very successful New Play Initiative, of [[Burbank, California|Burbank's]] Grove Theater Center the Moss Hart and Kitty Carlisle Hart New Play Initiative (Hart NPI) expands the program to one of the few programs of its kind where a playwright will be guaranteed a production of his/her play in Los Angeles (Burbank), as well as an Off-Broadway Premiere at 59E59 Theaters in New York City.  The GTC New Play Initiative is the brainchild of producers Charles Johanson and Kevin Cochran (founders of Grove Theater Center) and its expansion to a truly bi-coastal program with the focus on the author and their vision for their work. The Hart NPI is under the leadership of Moss Hart's son Christopher Hart (artistic director), Kevin Cochran (producing artistic director) and Charles Johanson (executive director). In the first Hart NPI play cycle (2017-2018) there were 1,243 submissions from 44 states and 6 countries!.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.hartnpi.org/| title=home| website=The Hart NPI| access-date=2018-06-06| language=en-US}}</ref> The Hart NPI will select 16-21 semifinalists, which will then be narrowed down to eight finalists and the eight will be narrowed down to the winners: Four Bronze Hart NPI winners will have a reading of their play at 59E59 Theaters, two Silver Hart NPI winners will have a production of their play in Los Angeles (Burbank), CA at the GTC Burbank and the Gold Hart NPI winner will have an Off-Broadway premiere at 59E59 Theaters. Dr. Catherine Hart (Moss and Kitty's daughter, who also serves on the Board of Trustees of the Hart NPI) said that "Having a program like this in Moss & Kitty's name would have made them proud."
