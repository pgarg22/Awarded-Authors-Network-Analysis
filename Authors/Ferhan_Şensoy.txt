(literally "Did I Drive Me Crazy?") in 2003.<ref name="h2"/><ref name="h3"/>

==Career==
He experienced his first professional acting with "Grup Oyuncuları" in 1971. Between 1972 and 1975, he studied [[Theatre in education]] in France and Canada. He worked under [[Jérôme Savary]] and Andre-Louis Périnetti. He was awarded the title "Best Foreigner Playwright" in [[Montreal]], Canada in 1975 for his play ''Ce Fou de Gogol''. He directed and played in the musical ''Harem qui rit'' at Théâtre des Quatre Sous in Montreal.<ref name="cnnt1"/>

In1975, Şensoy returned Turkey, and joined the "Nisa Serezli-Tolga Aşkıner Theatre" as an actor. He wrote several [[sketch comedy|Sketch comedies]] for the [[Turkish Radio and Television Corporation]] and the "Cabaret Theatre Devekuşu" in 1976. He staged his cabaret ''Dedikodu Şov'' ("Gossip Show") at night club "Stardust" that was played by [[Adile Naşit]], [[Perran Kutman]],  Pakize Suda, Sevda Karaca and with music by İstanbul Gelişim Orchestra.

In the same year, he founded the theatre company "Anyamanya" with Mete İnselel. He directed and played in his own play ''[[Idi Amin|İdi Amin]] Avantadan Lavanta''.<ref name="cnnt1"/> 

==Theatre fire==
On 9 February 1987, the theatre building, in which Ferhan Şensoy staged the [[musical theatre|musical play]] ''Muzır Müzikal'' (literally "Mischievous Musical"), burnt down completely caused "officially" by short circuit fault.<ref name="r1"/> The play featured ironic criticisms of the fundamentalist segment in Turkey.<ref name="h4"/> 

The structure next to the [[Surp Agop Hospital|Surp Agop Armenian Hospital]]  at [[Elmadağ, Şişli]] in Istanbul was constructed mid 1950 upon the initiative of film producer [[Turgut Demirağ]] (1921–1987) and owned by the Hospital Foundation. Named "Theatre Şan", it had a large foyer, a hall with magnificent acoustic, luxurious lodges and a big stage measuring {{cvt|22|x|16|m}}. The venue was used as a movie thaetre and a music hall for concerts in the past.<ref name="r1"/>

In a television show in 2001, Şensoy alleged that the fire was set by religious fanatic police officers, who were assigned to protect him.<ref name="h4"/>

==Master of comedy==
Kel Hasan Efendi (1874-1925 or 1929), a master actor of comedy in the Turkish theatre during the final years of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman era]], was nicknamed "Hasan the Bald", and wore a headgear, a quilted [[ turban ]] ({{lang-tr|kavuk}}), on the stage. He played a character similar to "Kavuklu" (literally "the one wearing quilted turban") of the  [[theatre in the round]] ({{lang-tr|orta oyunu}}) at the end of the 1800s. After retirement, he handed over his "kavuk" to İsmail Hakkı Dümbüllü (1897-1973) as a symbol of the mastery of the traditional [[improvisational theatre]] ({{lang-tr|tuluat}}) and theatre in the round. The "kavuk" was handed over to [[Münir Özkul]] (1925-2018) in 1968, a master of comedy in the [[cinema of Turkey]]. Ferhan Şensoy received the "kavuk" in 1989, and wore it 27 years long until March 2016, when he passed it over to [[Rasim Öztekin]] (1959–2021).<ref name="c1"/>

In the words of Münir Özkul, the "kavuk" is a symbol of 600 years of a culture, an art of performance called "tuluat" (improvisation).<ref name="c1"/>

On 2 July 2021, Ferhan Şensoy was hospitalized due to [[internal bleeding]]. Some time ago, he had underwent an [[angioplasty]] surgery due to health problems. He was taken to hospital due to the complication that developed due following the surgery. After his treatment there, he was transferred to a private hospital for precautionary purposes.<ref name="c2"/> 

Şensoy died in the Medical Faculty Hospital of [[Istanbul University]] on 31 August 2021. He was interred at the [[Zincirlikuyu Cemetery]] after the memorial ceremonies held at Galatasaray High School and the Theatre Ses in [[Beyoğlu]] as well as the religious service at [[Teşvikiye Mosque]] on 2 September.<ref name="sc1"/>
