{{Short description|English nobleman title}}'''Earl of Dorset''' is a title that has been created at least four times in the [[Peerage of England]]. Some of its holders have at various times also held the rank of [[Marquess of Dorset|marquess]] and, from 1720, [[Duke of Dorset|duke]].

A possible first creation is not well documented. About 1070 [[Saint Osmund|Osmund]], or Osmer, is said to have been created earl of Dorset, but the authority is a very late one and Osmund described himself simply as bishop. [[William de Mohun of Dunster, 1st Earl of Somerset|William de Mohun]] appears as earl of Dorset or Somerset, these two shires being in early times united under a single [[sheriff]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=431}}

It was later created in 1411 for [[Thomas Beaufort, 1st Duke of Exeter|Thomas Beaufort]], who was later created [[Duke of Exeter]].  The peerages became extinct on his death. It was next created in 1441 for [[Edmund Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset|Edmund Beaufort]] who was later created first [[Marquess of Dorset]] (1442) then [[Duke of Somerset]] (1446).  These titles were forfeited by the second duke in 1464.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=431}}

The last creation was in 1604 for [[Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset|Thomas Sackville, 1st Baron Buckhurst]].  In 1720 the seventh earl was created [[Duke of Dorset]] in the [[Peerage of Great Britain]].  On the death of the fifth duke in 1843 the peerages became extinct.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=431}}
