CRITICAL RESPONSE TO ''JESUS HATES ME:''

Lemon has hit upon a genre as irreverent and at times as profane as rap, yet filled with pertinent issues and rebellious politics.--[https://variety.com/2006/legit/reviews/jesus-hates-me-1200518946/ ''Variety'']

[This] irreverent dramedy about the search for meaning may offend as often as it convulses.  Lemon's narrative is both wildly inappropriate and keenly idiomatic.  There's a compassionate point beneath its quirky corrosion.--[https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/02/review-jesus-ha.html ''Los Angeles Times'']

Lemon is a keen observer of human flaws and frailties, skillfully merging dozens of minute details to form a seriocomic mosaic.  Up close, much of it is pointedly funny.  From a distance, it's sickly-sad.--[https://www.ocregister.com/2009/02/06/jesus-hates-me-wrings-laughs-from-its-dramatic-core/ ''Orange County Regiser'']

Though ''Jesus Hates Me'' does have its occasional sweet moments, it’s the acidic ones that make it such a treat.--[http://stagescenela.com/2009/02/jesus-hates-me/ ''StageSceneLA'']

''Jesus Hates Me'' questions faith by confronting social taboos, everything from racism to blasphemy, fraud to adultery, suicide to incest — all through a lens of dark humor.--[https://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2016/apr/25/theater-jesus-hates-me-ion-theatre/ ''San Diego Reader'']

An exquisite comedy, featuring black lines of intriguing thought, with some of the funniest dialogue ever heard.  Lemon has done an amazing piece of work.--''Back Stage''

''Jesus Hates Me'' is a character study, a comedy, a dramatic statement, a fleeting discourse on religion, an exploration of belief, a brief treatise on predestination versus self-determination and a whole lot of fun.  It is alive as few plays are.--''Centerstage''  

This irreverent take on the search for meaning is hilarious, poignant, heartfelt, and a deeply vivid portrait of lives teetering on the edge of something big.--''KPBS Arts''

Lemon's comic touch is razor sharp.--''San Diego Union-Tribune''
