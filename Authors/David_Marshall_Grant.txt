His first screen role was in the 1979 film ''[[French Postcards]]''. He went on to appear in several more films, both on the big screen and television. In 1985, he co-starred with [[Kevin Costner]] in [[John Badham]]'s film on bicycle racing, ''[[American Flyers]]''. By this time, Grant was also working in episodic television and also had the role of [[Digger Barnes]] in the miniseries ''[[Dallas: The Early Years]]'' in 1986. In 1987 he played Sonny Binkley in the [[Matt Dillon]] film ''[[The Big Town (1987 film)|The Big Town]]''. In 1989, he portrayed the gay character Russell Weller on the television show ''[[thirtysomething (TV series)|thirtysomething]]''. Although he only appeared in four episodes between 1989 and 1990, the role brought him considerable recognition, particularly in [[Strangers (thirtysomething)|one groundbreaking episode]] that featured his character in bed with another male character – a scene that caused outcry among conservative sponsors at the time.

Grant went on to play roles in various television shows and movies, including ''[[Happy Birthday, Gemini]]'', ''[[Legs (film)|Legs]]'', ''[[Labor of Love (TV movie)|Labor of Love]]'', ''[[CSI: Miami]]'', ''[[Law & Order]]'', ''[[Criminal Minds]]'', and ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]''. In 2004, he played a gay husband in the remake of ''[[The Stepford Wives (2004 film)|The Stepford Wives]]'', and played the father of [[Anne Hathaway]]'s character in the 2006 film ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|The Devil Wears Prada]]''. His last appearance on television was in an episode of ''[[Party Down]]'' in May 2009.

On the stage, Grant is most notable for his portrayal of Joe Pitt in the first Broadway production of [[Tony Kushner]]'s ''[[Angels in America]]''. The role earned him a 1994 [[Tony Award]] nomination as Best Actor (Featured Role – Play).

In 1998, Grant began a career as a writer. His first play, ''Snakebit'', premiered at NYC's Grove Street Playhouse and subsequently transferred to the Century Theatre. The play was nominated for the 1999 [[Drama Desk Award]] for Outstanding Play and was also nominated for an [[Outer Critics Circle Award]]. His second play, ''Current Events'', was produced by [[Manhattan Theatre Club]] in 2000. His most recent play, ''[[Pen (play)|Pen]]'', opened in 2006 at [[Playwrights Horizons]]. Also in 2006, he began working for the ABC drama series ''[[Brothers & Sisters (2006 TV series)|Brothers & Sisters]]'' as a screenwriter, story editor and (as of season 2 in September 2007), a series producer. In October 2009, he was named 'Head Showrunner'. The show was co-produced by [[Ken Olin]], whom Grant had worked with on ''thirtysomething'' many years earlier. In 2012, he was a writer and producer on the NBC musical series ''[[Smash (U.S. TV series)|Smash]]''.

Grant is the great-great-grandson of the first couple to have their wedding featured in the famous wedding announcement section of the ''New York Times''.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/weddings/165-years-of-wedding-announcements/type/1851-1880?module=ConversationPieces&region=Body&action=click&pgtype=article|title=COMMITTED – 1851 – 1880|access-date=February 10, 2017}}</ref> He is also a distant cousin to [[Ulysses S.
