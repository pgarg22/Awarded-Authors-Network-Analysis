'''Samuel A. Taylor''' (June 13, 1912 &ndash; May 26, 2000) was an [[United States|American]] [[playwright]] and [[screenwriter]].

==Biography==

Born Samuel Albert Tanenbaum, in a [[Jewish]] family, in [[Chicago, Illinois]], Taylor made his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut as author of the play ''The Happy Time'' in 1950. He wrote the play ''[[Sabrina Fair]]'' (1953) and co-wrote [[Sabrina (1954 film)|its film adaptation]] released the following year. In 1955, he won a [[Golden Globe]] and was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for the screenplay. His early success brought him more work in [[Hollywood]], including the biographical film ''[[The Eddy Duchin Story]]'' (1956) and the [[Alfred Hitchcock]] classic ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958).
  
His film career faded after the initial box office failure of ''Vertigo'', though Hitchcock and Taylor remained frequent collaborators. He was often contracted to write drafts for Hitchcock's later films, such as ''[[Torn Curtain]]'' (1966), though Taylor's only other Hitchcock screenplay (apart from ''Vertigo'') was for ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'' (1969).

Taylor was nominated for his only [[Tony Award]] as co-producer of the musical play ''[[No Strings]]'' (1962), for which he also wrote the book. Other playwrighting credits include ''Avanti!'' (1968), which was later adapted for the Billy Wilder film [[Avanti!|released in 1972]], and ''[[Legend (play)|Legend]]'' (1976).

Taylor died of [[heart failure]] in [[Blue Hill, Maine]]. His credits are sometimes confused with those of novelist and screenwriter [[Samuel W. Taylor]].
