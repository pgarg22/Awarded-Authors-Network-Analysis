'''Hannah Adelle Weiner''' ([[née]] '''Finegold''') (November 4, 1928 – September 11, 1997) was an American [[poet]] who is often grouped with the ''[[Language poets]]'' because of the prominent place she assumed in the poetics of that group.

== Early life and writings ==
Weiner was born in [[Providence, Rhode Island]] and attended [[Classical High School]], until 1946, and then [[Radcliffe College]].<ref name="bernstein">{{cite web

Working in publishing and then in [[Bloomingdale's]] department store, she was married and then divorced after four years. Weiner started writing poetry in 1963 though her first [[chapbook]], ''The Magritte Poems'' after [[René Magritte]], was published in 1970. It is not indicative of her latter work, being "basically a New York School attempt to write verse in response to the paintings of René Magritte".<ref name="durgin">{{cite web

These included 'Hannah Weiner at Her Job', "a sort of open house hosted by her employer, A.H. Schreiber Co., Inc."<ref name="durgin"/> and 'Fashion Show Poetry Event' with Eduardo Costa, John Perreault, [[Andy Warhol]] and others in a  "collaborative and innovative enterprise that incorporated conceptual art, design, poetry and performance."<ref>{{cite web

== Mature work ==
In the early 1970s, Weiner began writing a series of journals that were partly the result of her experiments with [[Surrealist techniques|automatic]] writing and partly a result of her [[schizophrenia]]. Judith Goldman claims that politics and ethics were central to a mode of writing she developed and called  "clair-style," which used "words and phrases clairvoyantly seen" and that Weiner arrived at a method of composing that employed "these seen elements exclusively."<ref name="Goldman">{{cite web

  | accessdate = October 21, 2012}}</ref>  Goldman also provides the insight that "Weiner let no representation of herself circulate that did not take her status as a clairvoyant into account."<ref name="Goldman" />
She influenced a number of the [[language poets]] and was included in the ''In the American Tree'' anthology of Language poetry (edited by [[Ron Silliman]]). Beginning with ''Little Books/Indians'' (1980) and ''Spoke'' (1984) Weiner's work engaged with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] politics, particularly the [[American Indian Movement]] and the case of imprisoned activist [[Leonard Peltier]].<ref>{{cite conference

  | quote = From a thematic standpoint, Weiner's poetry shows that she remained an outspoken supporter of the aim movement: the work reminds its readers of the imprisonment of aim leaders Peltier and Russell Means (who was arrested, tried, and jailed a number of times, as well as shot by a Bureau of Indian Affairs policeman [Sayer 213]), and of the ongoing Indian struggles for religious freedom and economic and territorial parity.}}</ref>

Interest in Weiner continues into the 21st century with the recent publication of ''Hannah Weiner’s Open House'' (2007), "a representative selection spanning her decades of poetic output" <ref>[http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0702&L=poetics&D=1&O=D&P=58695 Poetics Archives SUNY Buffalo, Feb 2007].</ref> This volume was edited by Patrick F. Durgin, who provides an overview of Weiner's art:

{{cquote|Hannah Weiner’s influence extends from the 1960s New York avant-garde, where she was part of an unprecedented confluence of poets, performance and visual artists including [[Philip Glass]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Carolee Schneemann]], John Perrault, [[David Antin]], and [[Bernadette Mayer]]. Like fellow-traveler [[Jackson Mac Low]], she became an important part of the [[Language poetry]] of the 1970s and 1980s, and her influence can be seen today in the so-called "New Narrative" work stemming from the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. With other posthumous publications of late, her work is being discussed by scholars in feminist studies, poetics, and disability studies. But there does not yet exist a representative selection spanning her decades of poetic output. Hannah Weiner’s Open House aims to remedy this with previously uncollected (and mostly never-published) work, including performance texts, early [[New York School (art)|New York School]] influenced lyric poems, odes and remembrances to / of Mac Low and [[Ted Berrigan]], and later “clair-style” works.}}
