'''William Makepeace Thackeray''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|θ|æ|k|ər|i}}; 18 July 1811 – 24 December 1863) was a British [[novelist]], [[author]] and [[illustrator]]. He is known for his [[Satire|satirical]] works, particularly his 1848 novel ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]'', a panoramic portrait of British society, and the 1844 novel ''[[The Luck of Barry Lyndon]]'', which was [[Barry Lyndon|adapted for a 1975 film]] by [[Stanley Kubrick]].

==Biography==
Thackeray, an only child, was born in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]],<ref>Calcutta was the capital of the [[British Empire]] in [[British India|India]] at the time. Thackeray was born on the grounds of what is now the Armenian College & Philanthropic Academy, on the old Freeschool Street, now called Mirza Ghalib Street.</ref> [[British India]], where his father, Richmond Thackeray (1 September 1781 – 13 September 1815), was secretary to the Board of Revenue in the [[East India Company]]. His mother, Anne Becher (1792–1864), was the second daughter of Harriet Becher and John Harman Becher, who was also a secretary (writer) for the East India Company.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The inheritance of genius : a Thackeray family biography, 1798-1875|last=John.|first=Aplin|date=2010|publisher=Lutterworth Press|isbn=978-0718842109|location=Cambridge, U.K.|oclc=855607313}}</ref> His father was a grandson of [[Thomas Thackeray]] (1693–1760), headmaster of [[Harrow School]].<ref name=odnb>[https://doi.org/10.1093/odnb/9780192683120.013.27155 "THACKERAY, WILLIAM MAKEPEACE (1811–1863)"] in [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] online, {{subscription}}, accessed 4 May 2019</ref>

Richmond died in 1815, which caused Anne to send her son to England that same year, while she remained in India. The ship on which he travelled made a short stopover at [[Saint Helena]], where the imprisoned [[Napoleon]] was pointed out to him. Once in England he was educated at schools in [[Southampton]] and [[Chiswick]], and then at [[Charterhouse School]], where he became a close friend of [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]]. Thackeray disliked Charterhouse,<ref name="world and its people">{{cite book|last=Dunton|first=Larkin|title=The World and Its People|url=https://archive.org/details/worldanditspeop01duntgoog|publisher=Silver, Burdett|year=1896|page=[https://archive.org/details/worldanditspeop01duntgoog/page/n31 25]}}</ref> and parodied it in his fiction as "Slaughterhouse". Nevertheless, Thackeray was honoured in the Charterhouse Chapel with a monument after his death. Illness in his last year there, during which he reportedly grew to his full height of six-foot three, postponed his matriculation at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], until February 1829. {{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Never too keen on academic studies, Thackeray left Cambridge in 1830, but some of his earliest published writing appeared in two university periodicals, ''The Snob'' and ''The Gownsman''.<ref>{{acad|id=THKY826WM|name=Thackeray, William Makepeace}}</ref>

Thackeray then travelled for some time on the continent, visiting Paris and [[Weimar]], where he met [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]. He returned to England and began to study law at the [[Middle Temple]], but soon gave that up. On reaching the age of 21 he came into his inheritance from his father, but he squandered much of it on gambling and on funding two unsuccessful newspapers, ''The National Standard'' and ''The Constitutional'', for which he had hoped to write. He also lost a good part of his fortune in the collapse of two Indian banks. Forced to consider a profession to support himself, he turned first to art, which he studied in Paris, but did not pursue it, except in later years as the illustrator of some of his own novels and other writings.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Thackeray's years of semi-idleness ended after he married, on 20 August 1836, Isabella Gethin Shawe (1816–1894), second daughter of Isabella Creagh Shawe and Matthew Shawe, a colonel who had died after distinguished service, primarily in India. The Thackerays had three children, all girls: [[Anne Isabella Thackeray Ritchie|Anne Isabella]] (1837–1919), Jane (who died at eight months old) and [[Harriet Stephen|Harriet Marian]] (1840–1875), who married Sir [[Leslie Stephen]], editor, biographer and philosopher.

Thackeray now began "writing for his life", as he put it, turning to journalism in an effort to support his young family. He primarily worked for ''[[Fraser's Magazine]]'', a sharp-witted and sharp-tongued conservative publication for which he produced art criticism, short fictional sketches, and two longer fictional works, ''[[Catherine (Thackeray novel)|Catherine]]'' and ''[[The Luck of Barry Lyndon]]''. Between 1837 and 1840 he also reviewed books for ''[[The Times]]''.<ref>Gary Simons, "Thackeray's Contributions to the ''Times''", ''Victorian Periodicals Review'', 40:4 (2007, pp. 332–354</ref> He was also a regular contributor to ''[[The Morning Chronicle]]'' and ''The Foreign Quarterly Review''. Later, through his connection to the illustrator [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]], he began writing for the newly created magazine ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', in which he published ''The Snob Papers'', later collected as ''[[The Book of Snobs]]''. This work popularised the modern meaning of the word "snob".<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=2933542|last=Dabney|first=Ross H.|title=Review: ''The Book of Snob'' by William Makepeace Thackeray, John Sutherland|journal=Nineteenth-Century Fiction|volume=34|number=4|date=March 1980|pages=456–462, 455|doi=10.2307/2933542}}</ref> Thackeray was a regular contributor to ''Punch'' between 1843 and 1854.<ref name="historyireland.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.historyireland.com/18th-19th-century-history/punch-and-the-great-famine-by-peter-gray/|title=Punch and the Great Famine|date=2013-01-23|website=History Ireland|access-date=2019-07-17}}</ref>

[[File:Crowe-Thackeray 1845.jpg|thumb|left|Thackeray portrayed by [[Eyre Crowe (painter)|Eyre Crowe]], 1845]]
Tragedy struck in Thackeray's personal life as his wife, Isabella, succumbed to depression after the birth of their third child, in 1840. Finding that he could get no work done at home, he spent more and more time away until September 1840, when he realised how grave his wife's condition was. Struck by guilt, he set out with his wife to Ireland. During the crossing she threw herself from a water-closet into the sea, but she was pulled from the waters. They fled back home after a four-week battle with her mother. From November 1840 to February 1842 Isabella was in and out of professional care, as her condition waxed and waned.<ref name=odnb/>

She eventually deteriorated into a permanent state of detachment from reality. Thackeray desperately sought cures for her, but nothing worked, and she ended up in two different asylums in or near Paris until 1845, after which Thackeray took her back to England, where he installed her with a Mrs Bakewell at Camberwell. Isabella outlived her husband by 30 years, in the end being cared for by a family named Thompson in Leigh-on-Sea at Southend until her death in 1894.<ref>Ann Monsarrat, ''An Uneasy Victorian: Thackeray the Man, 1811–1863'', London: Cassell, 1980, pp. 121, 128, 134, 161; John Aplin, ''Memory and Legacy: A Thackeray Family Biography, 1876–1919'', Cambridge: Lutterworth, 2011, pp. 5, 136.</ref> After his wife's illness Thackeray became a ''de facto'' widower, never establishing another permanent relationship. He did pursue other women, however, in particular Mrs [[Jane Octavia Brookfield|Jane Brookfield]] and Sally Baxter. In 1851 Mr Brookfield barred Thackeray from further visits to or correspondence with Jane. Baxter, an American twenty years Thackeray's junior whom he met during a lecture tour in New York City in 1852, married another man in 1855.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

In the early 1840s Thackeray had some success with two travel books, ''The Paris Sketch Book'' and ''The Irish Sketch Book'', the latter marked by its hostility towards [[Irish Catholics]]. However, as the book appealed to [[anti-Irish sentiment]] in Britain at the time, Thackeray was given the job of being ''Punch''{{'}}s Irish expert, often under the [[pseudonym]] Hibernis Hibernior ("more Irish than the Irish").<ref name="historyireland.com"/> Thackeray became responsible for creating ''Punch''{{'}}s notoriously hostile and negative depictions of the Irish during the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Irish Famine]] of 1845 to 1851.<ref name="historyireland.com"/>

Thackeray achieved more recognition with his ''Snob Papers'' (serialised 1846/7, published in book form in 1848), but the work that really established his fame was the novel ''Vanity Fair'', which first appeared in serialised instalments beginning in January 1847. Even before ''Vanity Fair'' completed its serial run Thackeray had become a celebrity, sought after by the very lords and ladies whom he satirised. They hailed him as the equal of [[Charles Dickens]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Brander |first1=Laurence |title=Thackeray, William Makepeace |url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/32424936 |website=Ebscohost |publisher=Britannica Biographies |access-date=3 June 2019}}</ref>

[[File:Portrait of W. M. Thackeray (4672053).jpg|thumb|Portrait of Thackeray in his study, c.1860]]
He remained "at the top of the tree", as he put it, for the rest of his life, during which he produced several large novels, notably ''[[Pendennis]]'', ''[[The Newcomes]]'' and ''[[The History of Henry Esmond]]'', despite various illnesses, including a near-fatal one that struck him in 1849 in the middle of writing ''Pendennis''. He twice visited the United States on lecture tours during this period. Thackeray also gave lectures in London on the English humorists of the eighteenth century, and on the first four [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] monarchs. The latter series was published in book form as ''The Four Georges''.<ref name=odnb/>

In July 1857 Thackeray stood unsuccessfully as a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] for the city of Oxford in Parliament.<ref name=odnb /> Although not the most fiery agitator, Thackeray was always a decided liberal in his politics, and he promised to vote for the ballot in extension of the suffrage, and was ready to accept triennial parliaments.<ref name=odnb /> He was narrowly beaten by [[Edward Cardwell, 1st Viscount Cardwell|Cardwell]], who received 1,070 votes, as against 1,005 for Thackeray.<ref name=odnb />

In 1860 Thackeray became editor of the newly established ''[[Cornhill Magazine]]'',<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=klM8DwAAQBAJ&q=%22The+Cornhill+magazine%22+editor+thackeray&pg=PT289|title=W.M.Thackery and the Mediated Text: Writing for Periodicals in the Mid-Nineteenth Century|last=Pearson|first=Richard|date=2017-11-01|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781351774093|language=en}}</ref> but he was never comfortable in the role, preferring to contribute to the magazine as the writer of a column called "Roundabout Papers".{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Thackeray's health worsened during the 1850s and he was plagued by a recurring [[Urethral stricture|stricture of the urethra]] that laid him up for days at a time. He also felt that he had lost much of his creative impetus. He worsened matters by excessive eating and drinking, and avoiding exercise, though he enjoyed riding (he kept a horse). He has been described as "the greatest literary glutton who ever lived". His main activity apart from writing was "gutting and gorging".<ref>[http://www.newstatesman.com/vanity-fare Bee Wilson, "Vanity Fare", ''New Statesman'', 27 November 1998]. Retrieved 4 January 2014</ref> He could not break his addiction to spicy peppers, further ruining his digestion.

On 23 December 1863, after returning from dining out and before dressing for bed, he suffered a stroke. He was found dead in his bed the following morning. His death at the age of fifty-two was entirely unexpected, and shocked his family, his friends and the reading public. An estimated 7,000 people attended his funeral at [[Kensington Gardens]]. He was buried on 29 December at [[Kensal Green Cemetery]], and a memorial bust sculpted by [[Carlo Marochetti|Marochetti]] can be found in [[Westminster Abbey]].<ref name=odnb/>

Thackeray began as a satirist and parodist, writing works that displayed a sneaking fondness for roguish upstarts such as Becky Sharp in ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]'', and the title characters of ''[[The Memoirs of Barry Lyndon, Esq.|The Luck of Barry Lyndon]]'' and ''[[Catherine (Thackeray novel)|Catherine]]''. In his earliest works, written under such pseudonyms as Charles James Yellowplush, Michael Angelo Titmarsh and George Savage Fitz-Boodle, he tended towards savagery in his attacks on high society, military prowess, the institution of marriage and hypocrisy.

One of his earliest works, "Timbuctoo" (1829), contains a burlesque upon the subject set for the Cambridge Chancellor's Medal for English Verse (the contest was won by [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]] with "Timbuctoo"). Thackeray's writing career really began with a series of satirical sketches now usually known as ''The Yellowplush Papers'', which appeared in ''Fraser's Magazine'' beginning in 1837. These were adapted for [[BBC Radio 4]] in 2009, with [[Adam Buxton]] playing Charles Yellowplush.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.org.uk/guide/radio/the_yellowplush_papers/|title=The Yellowplush Papers|publisher=British Comedy Guide|access-date =9 February 2009}}</ref>

Between May 1839 and February 1840 ''Fraser's'' published the work sometimes considered Thackeray's first novel, ''[[Catherine (Thackeray novel)|Catherine]]''. Originally intended as a satire of the [[Newgate novel|Newgate]] school of crime fiction, it ended up being more of a [[picaresque novel|picaresque]] tale. He also began work, never finished, on the novel later published as ''[[A Shabby Genteel Story]]''.

[[File:Houghton EC85 T3255 848vb - Vanity Fair, title.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Title-page to ''Vanity Fair'', drawn by Thackeray, who furnished the illustrations for many of his own books]]
Along with ''The Luck of Barry Lyndon'', Thackeray is probably best known now for ''Vanity Fair''. Literary theorist Kornelije Kvas wrote that "the meteoric rise of the heroine of ''Vanity Fair'' Rebecca Sharp is a satirical presentation of the striving for profit, power and social recognition of the new middle class. Old and new members of the middle class strive to emulate the lifestyle of the higher class (noblemen and landowners), and thereby to increase their material possessions and to own luxury objects. In ''Vanity Fair'', one can observe a greater degree of violation of moral values among members of the new middle class, for the decline of morality is proportionate to the degree of closeness of the individual to the market and its laws."<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Boundaries of Realism in World Literature|last=Kvas|first=Kornelije|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2019|isbn=978-1-7936-0910-6|location=Lanham, Boulder, New York, London|pages=43}}</ref> In contrast, his large novels from the period after ''Vanity Fair'', which were once described by [[Henry James]] as examples of "loose baggy monsters", have largely faded from view, perhaps because they reflect a mellowing in Thackeray, who had become so successful with his satires on society that he seemed to lose his zest for attacking it. These later works include ''[[Pendennis]]'', a [[Bildungsroman]] depicting the [[coming of age]] of Arthur Pendennis, an alter ego of Thackeray, who also features as the narrator of two later novels, ''[[The Newcomes]]'' and ''[[The Adventures of Philip]]''. ''The Newcomes'' is noteworthy for its critical portrayal of the "marriage market", while ''Philip'' is known for its semi-autobiographical depiction of Thackeray's early life, in which he partially regains some of his early satirical power.

Also notable among the later novels is ''[[The History of Henry Esmond]]'', in which Thackeray tried to write a novel in the style of the eighteenth century, a period that held great appeal for him. About this novel, there have been found evident analogies—in the fundamental structure of the plot; in the psychological outlines of the main characters; in frequent episodes; and in the use of metaphors—to [[Ippolito Nievo]]'s ''Confessions of an Italian''. Nievo wrote his novel during his stay in Milan where, in the "Ambrosiana" library, ''The History of Henry Esmond'' was available, just published.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://leaslerca.retelinux.com/index_en.html|title=Lea Slerca|website=leaslerca.retelinux.com|access-date=2019-07-17}}</ref>

Not only ''Esmond'' but also ''Barry Lyndon'' and ''Catherine'' are set in that period, as is the sequel to ''Esmond'', ''[[The Virginians]]'', which is set partially in North America and includes George Washington as a character who nearly kills one of the protagonists in a duel.

===Parents===

Thackeray's father, Richmond Thackeray, was born at [[South Mimms]] and went to India in 1798 at age sixteen as a writer (civil servant) with the [[East India Company]]. Richmond's father's name was also William Makepeace Thackeray.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://coldnoon.com/magazine/news/travel-bulletin/william-makepeace-thackeray-traded-elephants-in-sylhet/|title=William Makepeace Thackeray Traded Elephants in Sylhet|date=28 May 2016}}</ref> Richmond fathered a daughter, Sarah Redfield, in 1804 with Charlotte Sophia Rudd, his possibly Eurasian mistress, and both mother and daughter were named in his will. Such liaisons were common among gentlemen of the East India Company, and it formed no bar to his later courting and marrying William's mother.<ref name="Menon">{{cite web|url=http://yet.typepad.com/round_dice/2006/03/william_makepea.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614010910/http://yet.typepad.com/round_dice/2006/03/william_makepea.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=14 June 2010|title=William Makepeace Thackeray: The Indian in the Closet|last=Menon|first=Anil|date=29 March 2006|work=Round Dice|access-date=3 December 2014}}</ref>

[[Image:Ann & Wm M'peace Thackeray,Madras age 2 by Chinnery.jpg|thumb|left|Anne Becher and William Makepeace Thackeray by [[George Chinnery]], c.&nbsp;1813]]
Thackeray's mother, Anne Becher (born 1792), was "one of the reigning beauties of the day" and a daughter of John Harmon Becher, Collector of the [[South 24 Parganas district]] (d. Calcutta, 1800), of an old Bengal civilian family "noted for the tenderness of its women". Anne Becher, her sister Harriet and their widowed mother, also Harriet, had been sent back to India by her authoritarian guardian grandmother, Ann Becher, in 1809 on the ''Earl Howe''. Anne's grandmother had told her that the man she loved, Henry Carmichael-Smyth, an ensign in the [[Bengal Engineers]] whom she met at an Assembly Ball in 1807 in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], had died, while he was told that Anne was no longer interested in him. Neither of these assertions was true. Though Carmichael-Smyth was from a distinguished Scottish military family, Anne's grandmother went to extreme lengths to prevent their marriage. Surviving family letters state that she wanted a better match for her granddaughter.<ref name="Alexander">{{cite web|url=http://www.henrycort.net/hrthack.htm|title=Ancestry of William Thackeray|last=Alexander|first=Eric|year=2007|work=Henry Cort Father of the Iron Trade|publisher=henrycort.net|access-date=10 February 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130221150842/http://www.henrycort.net/hrthack.htm|archive-date=21 February 2013}}</ref>

Anne's family's deception was unexpectedly revealed in 1812, when Richmond Thackeray unwittingly invited the supposedly dead Carmichael-Smyth to dinner. Five years later, after Richmond had died of a fever on 13 September 1815, Anne married Henry Carmichael-Smyth, on 13 March 1817. The couple moved to England in 1820, after having sent William off to school there more than three years earlier. The separation from his mother had a traumatic effect on the young Thackeray, which he discussed in his essay "On Letts's Diary" in ''The Roundabout Papers''.

[[File:Etching of William Makepeace Thackeray by George Barnett Smith.jpg|thumb|right|[[Etching]] of Thackeray, ca. 1867]]
During the Victorian era Thackeray was ranked second only to [[Charles Dickens]], but he is now much less widely read and is known almost exclusively for ''Vanity Fair'', which has become a fixture in university courses, and has been repeatedly adapted for the cinema and television.

In Thackeray's own day some commentators, such as [[Anthony Trollope]], ranked his ''History of Henry Esmond'' as his greatest work, perhaps because it expressed Victorian values of duty and earnestness, as did some of his other later novels. It is perhaps for this reason that they have not survived as well as ''Vanity Fair'', which satirises those values.

Thackeray saw himself as writing in the realistic tradition, and distinguished his work from the exaggerations and sentimentality of Dickens. Some later commentators have accepted this self-evaluation and seen him as a realist, but others note his inclination to use eighteenth-century narrative techniques, such as digressions and direct addresses to the reader, and argue that through them he frequently disrupts the illusion of reality. The school of [[Henry James]], with its emphasis on maintaining that illusion, marked a break with Thackeray's techniques.

Indian popular [[Marathi people|Marathi]] politician [[Bal Thackeray]]'s father [[Keshav Sitaram Thackeray]] was an admirer of William, the India-born British writer; Keshav later changed his surname from Panvelkar to "Thackeray".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-20389849 |title=The legacy of Bal Thackeray |author=Soutik Biswas |date=19 November 2012 |publisher=BBC }}</ref><ref name="Sree_ON_2012">{{cite web |url=http://www.oneindia.com/2012/11/18/why-bal-thackeray-had-an-english-surname-1100587.html |title=Why Bal Thackeray had an English surname |author=Sreekumar |publisher=One India |date=18 November 2012 }}</ref>
