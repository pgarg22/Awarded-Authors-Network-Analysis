'''Hermann Bahr''' ({{IPA-de|ˈhɛʁman ˈbaːɐ̯}}; 19 July 1863 – 15 January 1934) was an [[Austria]]n [[German literature|writer]], playwright, director, and critic.

==Biography==
Born and raised in [[Linz]],<ref>{{Cite web|date=January 16, 1934|title=Hermann Bahr, 70, Dramatist, is Dead|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1934/01/16/95026832.html?zoom=16.23|access-date=September 21, 2020|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|page=21|language=en}}</ref> Bahr studied in [[Vienna]], [[Graz]], [[Czernowitz]] and [[Berlin]], devoting special attention to [[philosophy]], [[political economy]], [[philology]] and [[law]]. During a prolonged stay in [[Paris]], he discovered his interest in literature and art. He began working as an art critic, first in Berlin, then in Vienna. In 1890 he became associate editor of ''Berliner Freie Bühne'' (''Berlin Free Stage''), and later became associate editor and critic of the ''Deutsche Zeitung'' (''German Newspaper''). In 1894 he began publication of ''Die Zeit'' (''The Times''), and was also editor of the ''Neue Wiener Tagblatt'' (''New Vienna Daily Flyer'') and the ''Oesterreichische Volkszeitung'' (''Austrian Popular Newspaper'').

In 1906–07, Bahr worked with [[Max Reinhardt (theatre director)|Max Reinhardt]] as a director at the German Theater ({{lang-de|Deutsches Theater}}) in [[Berlin]], and starting in 1918 he was a [[Dramaturg]] with the Vienna [[Burgtheater]].

Spokesman for the literary group [[Young Vienna]], Bahr was an active member of the Austrian avant-garde, producing both criticism and [[Impressionism (literature)|Impressionist]] plays. Bahr's association with the coffeehouse literati made him one of the main targets of [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]]'s satirical journal ''[[Die Fackel]]'' (''The Torch'') after Kraus's falling out with the group.

Bahr was the first critic to apply the label [[modernism]] to literary works, and was an early observer of [[Expressionism]]. His theoretical papers were important in the definition of new literary categories. His 40 plays and around 10 novels never reached the quality of his theoretical work. He died, aged 70, in [[Munich]].
