'''Andrzej Bursa''' (21 March 1932 – 15 November 1957) was a Polish poet and writer.

Born in [[Kraków]], he studied journalism, then [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] at [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Kraków]]. In 1954–1957 Bursa worked as a journalist and reporter for the Kraków newspaper ''[[Dziennik Polski]]''. Many of his contemporaries attributed his early death at the age of 25 to suicide, while the true cause of it was a congenital heart disease. He was buried at the [[Rakowicki Cemetery]].

Bursa published his first poem in 1954. A prolific writer, he published 37 poems and a short story in different magazines during his lifetime. He died of a heart attack in 1957. Shortly thereafter, his first poetry collection was published, an important event in Polish poetry. Presently, there is a poetry prize named after Bursa which many living Polish poets have won (e.g. [[Ewa Lipska]] and [[Stanisław Barańczak]]).
