'''Digby Augustus Stewart Mackworth Dolben''' (8 February 1848 – 28 June 1867) was an English [[poet]] who died young from drowning. He owes his poetic reputation to his cousin, [[Robert Bridges]], [[poet laureate]] from 1913 to 1930, who edited a partial edition of his verse, ''Poems'', in 1911.

He was born in [[Guernsey]], and brought up at [[Finedon Hall]] in [[Northamptonshire]].  His father, William Harcourt Isham Mackworth (1806—1872), a younger son of Sir Digby Mackworth, the [[Mackworth baronets|3rd Baronet]], took the additional surname Dolben after he married Frances, the heiress of Sir John English Dolben, the [[Dolben baronets|4th Baronet]].

He was educated at [[Cheam School]] and [[Eton College]], studying under the influential Master [[William Johnson Cory]] whose principles of pedagogy and collection of verses ''Ionica'' inspired his own poetry.<ref name="cohen81">{{cite book| title=The Poems and Letters of Digby Mackworth Dolben 1848–1867 | editor-first=Martin | editor-last=Cohen | year=1981 }}</ref> At Eton, his distant cousin Bridges was his senior and took him under his wing.

Dolben caused considerable scandal at school by his exhibitionist behaviour. He marked his romantic attachment to another pupil a year older than he was, [[Martin Gosselin|Martin Le Marchant Gosselin]], by writing love poetry.  He also defied his strict Protestant upbringing by joining  a [[High Church]] [[Puseyite]] group of pupils. He then claimed allegiance to the [[Order of St Benedict]], affecting a [[Religious habit|monk's habit]]. He was considering a conversion to [[Roman Catholicism]].<ref>Cohen (1981), p.171, quoting letter from Dolben to [[John Henry Newman]], dated 20 March 1867.</ref>

In 1865 on his seventeenth birthday, he was introduced by Bridges, by then an undergraduate at [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]], to [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]] who was at [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]]. According to the account given by his biographer Norman White, this encounter greatly perturbed Hopkins.

Hopkins's biographer [[Robert Bernard Martin]] asserts that Hopkins’s meeting with Dolben, "was, quite simply, the most momentous emotional event of [his] undergraduate years, probably of his entire life".<ref>''Gerard Manley Hopkins: A Very Private Life'', p. 80; see also Norman White, ''Hopkins: A Literary Biography'', p. 110.</ref>
{{quote|''Hopkins was completely taken with Dolben, who was nearly four years his junior, and his private journal for confessions the following year proves how absorbed he was in imperfectly suppressed erotic thoughts of him''<ref>Robert Bernard Martin, "Digby Augustus Stewart Dolben," ''[[Dictionary of National Biography|DNB]]''.</ref>}}

Hopkins kept up a correspondence with Dolben, wrote about him in his diary and composed two poems about the youth, "Where art thou friend" and "The Beginning of the End."<ref name="cohen81" /> Hopkins' High Anglican confessor seems to have forbidden him to have any contact with Dolben except by letter. Dolben's death greatly affected Hopkins, although his feeling for Dolben seems to have cooled  by that time.<ref name="cohen81" />

Dolben drowned in the [[River Welland]] when bathing with the ten-year-old  son of his tutor, Rev. C. E. Prichard, Rector of [[South Luffenham]]. He was aged 19 and preparing to go up to [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].

Bridges guaranteed Dolben's reputation with ''Three Friends: Memoirs of Digby Mackworth Dolben, Richard Watson Dixon, Henry Bradley'' (1932), as well as the careful editing of his poetry. Subsequently, ''The Poems and Letters of Digby Mackworth Dolben 1848–1867'' (1981) has given a less selective picture.<ref name="cohen81" />

Hopkins' infatuation for Dolben and Dolben's tragic death feature in [[Simon Edge]]'s novel ''The Hopkins Conundrum'' (2017).<ref>{{cite web|title=The Hopkins Conundrum|url=http://eye-books.com/books/the-hopkins-conundrum|publisher=Eye Books|accessdate=22 January 2017}}</ref>
