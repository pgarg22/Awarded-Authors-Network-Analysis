Lewis. In 1871, he translated [[Erckmann-Chatrian]]'s ''[[Le Juif Polonais]]'', giving it the name ''[[The Bells (play)|The Bells]]'', under which name it was produced by [[Henry Irving]] at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London]], 25 November 1871 and repeatedly thereafter.

''The Bells'' was Lewis' first play, and his only success.<ref name=Irving>Jones-Evans, Eric (editor), ''Henry Irving and the Bells: Irving's Personal Script of the Play''  [[Manchester University Press]] (1980) pgs 5-7</ref> Original plays from the pen of Lewis are: ''The Wandering Jew'' ([[Adelphi Theatre]], 14 April 1873); ''Give a Dog a Bad Name'' (ib. 18 November 1873); and ''The Foundlings'' ([[Sadler's Wells Theatre]], 8 October 1881). From February to December 1868 he and [[Alfred Thompson (librettist)|Alfred Thompson]] conducted a monthly review, ''The Mask'', which failed. In addition to the plays mentioned Lewis wrote a number of tales under the title ''A Peal of Merry Bells'' (1880).<ref name=DNB/>

Lewis never got used to the success of ''[[The Bells (play)|The Bells]]'', and although Irving did everything he could for him, Lewis became a man with a grievance, totally convinced that the success of ''The Bells'' was due to his adaptation rather than Irving's performance.<ref name=Irving/>

Lewis was found late one night seriously ill in [[Gray's Inn Road]] and was taken to the [[Royal Free Hospital]] where he died on 23 February 1890.<ref name=Irving/> He was buried at [[Kensal Green Cemetery]].<ref name=DNB/> In his will he left just Â£20 10s to his widow, Jane.<ref>[https://www.ancestry.co.uk/interactive/1904/31874_222844-00322?pid=2121310&backurl=https://search.ancestry.co.uk/cgi-bin/sse.dll?indiv%3D1%26dbid%3D1904%26h%3D2121310%26tid%3D%26pid%3D%26usePUB%3Dtrue%26_phsrc%3Ddjv1414%26_phstart%3DsuccessSource&treeid=&personid=&hintid=&usePUB=true&_phsrc=djv1414&_phstart=successSource&usePUBJs=true England & Wales, National Probate Calendar (Index of Wills and Administrations), 1858-1995 for Leopold David Lewis]  - [[Ancestry.com]] {{subscription}}</ref>
