'''Friedrich Rückert''' (16 May 1788 – 31 January 1866) was a [[Germany|German]] [[poet]], [[translation|translator]], and professor of [[Oriental languages]].

==Biography==
Rückert was born in [[Schweinfurt]] and was the eldest son of a lawyer. He was educated at the local ''[[gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]'' and at the universities of [[University of Würzburg|Würzburg]] and [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]]. From 1816 to 1817, he worked on the editorial staff of the ''Morgenblatt'' at [[Stuttgart]]. Nearly the whole of the year 1818 he spent in [[Rome]], and afterwards he lived for several years at [[Coburg]] (1820–1826). Rückert married Luise Wiethaus-Fischer there in 1821.<ref name="Guide"/>{{rp|113}} He was appointed a professor of Oriental languages at the [[University of Erlangen]] in 1826, and, in 1841, he was called to a similar position in [[Berlin]], where he was also made a [[privy councillor]]. In 1849 he resigned his professorship at Berlin, and went to live full-time in his ''Gut'' (estate) at Neuses (now a part of Coburg).

When Rückert began his literary career, Germany was engaged in her life-and-death struggle with [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]; and in his first volume, ''Deutsche Gedichte'' (''German Poems''), published in 1814 under the [[pseudonym]] '''Freimund Raimar''', he gave, particularly in the powerful ''Geharnischte Sonette'' (''Sonnets in Arms/Harsh Words''), vigorous expression to the prevailing sentiment of his countrymen. During 1815 to 1818 appeared ''Napoleon, eine politische Komödie in drei Stücken'' (''Napoleon, a Political Comedy in Three Parts'') of which only two parts were published; and in 1817 ''Der Kranz der Zeit'' (''The Wreath of Time'').

He issued a collection of poems, ''Östliche Rosen'' (''Eastern Roses''), in 1822; and from 1834 to 1838 his ''Gesammelte Gedichte'' (''Collected Poems'') were published in six volumes, a selection which has passed through many editions.

Rückert was master of thirty languages and made his mark chiefly as a translator of Oriental poetry and as a writer of poems conceived in the spirit of Oriental masters. Much attention was attracted by a translation of the ''[[Maqama]]t'' of [[Al-Hariri of Basra]] (''Hariris Makamen'') in 1826, ''Nal und Damajanti'', an Indian tale, in 1828, ''Rostem und Suhrab, eine Heldengeschichte'' (''Rostem and Suhrab, a Story of Heroes'') in 1830, and ''Hamasa, oder die ältesten arabischen Volkslieder'' (''Hamasa, or the Oldest Arabian Folk Songs'') in 1846.

Among his original writings dealing with Oriental subjects are:

*''Morgenländische Sagen und Geschichten'' (''Oriental Myths and Poems'') (1837)
*''Erbauliches und Beschauliches aus dem Morgenland'' (''Establishments and Contemplations from the Orient'') (1836–1838)
*''Brahmanische Erzählungen'' (''Brahmin Stories'') (1839).

The most elaborate of his works is ''Die Weisheit des Brahmanen'' (''The Wisdom of the [[Brahmin]]s''), published in six volumes from 1836 to 1839. The former and ''Liebesfrühling'' (''Spring of Love'') (1844), a cycle of love-songs, are the best known of all Rückert's productions.

From 1843 to 1845 he issued the dramas ''Saul und David'' (1843), ''Herodes der Große'' ("Herodes the Great") (1844), ''Kaiser Heinrich IV'' (1845) and ''Christofero Colombo'' (1845), all of which are considered greatly inferior to the work to which he owes his place in German literature. At the time of the [[Second War of Schleswig|Danish war in 1864]] he wrote ''Ein Dutzend Kampflieder für Schleswig-Holstein'' (''A Dozen Fight Songs for [[Schleswig-Holstein]]''), which, although published anonymously, made considerable impression on audiences.

Rückert died in 1866 in {{Interlanguage link multi|Neuses (Coburg)|de|3=Neuses bei Coburg|lt=Neuses}}, now part of [[Coburg]]. He is buried in the cemetery there.<ref name="Guide"/>{{rp|113}}

He continues to exert a strong influence on Oriental studies in Germany (c.f. [[Annemarie Schimmel]]).

Rückert's poetry was a powerful inspiration to composers and there are about 121 settings of his work – behind only [[Goethe]], [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]] and [[Rilke]] in this respect. Among the composers who set his poetry to music are [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], [[Robert Schumann|Robert]] and [[Clara Schumann]], [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] ([[Two Songs for Voice, Viola and Piano]], among others), [[Josef Rheinberger]], [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]] ([[song cycles]] ''[[Kindertotenlieder]]'', ''[[Rückert-Lieder]]''), [[Max Reger]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Zemlinsky]], [[Paul Hindemith|Hindemith]], [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]], [[Alban Berg|Berg]], [[Hugo Wolf]], [[Heinrich Kaspar Schmid]], and [[Jah Wobble]].

==Memorials==
[[File:Friedrich Rückert Monument.jpg|thumb|right|''Rückert Denkmal'' (monument) in Schweinfurt in 2014.]]
A monument to Rückert is situated at Marktplatz in [[Schweinfurt]]. The monument of Rückert, whose birth house stands at the southeast corner of the town hall, has stood in the central square of Schweinfurt since 1890. It was created by architect Friedrich Ritter von Thiersch and sculptor Wilhelm von Rühmann. Allegorical figures from his works – ''Geharnischte Sonette'' ("Withering Sonnets") and ''Weisheit des Brahmanen'' ("Wisdom of the Brahmans") – are situated at the feet of the bronze Rückert.

Rückert is also commemorated by a small museum in his home at Neuses (now in Friedrich-Rückert-Strasse) and a park, ''Rückertpark'' which also features a memorial bust.<ref name="Guide">{{cite book|last=Klüglein|first=Norbert|title=Coburg Stadt und Land (German)|publisher=Verkehrsverein Coburg|year=1991}}</ref>{{rp|113}} The museum in the Friedrich-Rückert-Straße houses over 1,000 dolls, including the grandmother of the world-famous "[[Barbie]]".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fewoco.de/index.php/puppenmuseum-coburg|title=Ferienwohnung Müller – Ihr Zuhause in Coburg – Puppenmuseum|website=www.fewoco.de|access-date=2019-08-17}}</ref>
