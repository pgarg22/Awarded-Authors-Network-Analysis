In 2013 he was awarded the [[Grand prix du théâtre (Académie française)|Grand prix du théâtre de l'Académie française]].

==Biography==
One of the most acclaimed theater writer/directors of the 20th century, Gatti was originally a member of the informal Left Bank group of filmmakers that included [[Alain Resnais]], [[Chris Marker]], [[Agnès Varda]], [[Henri Colpi]] and [[Jean Cayrol]], but because none of his films have been released on video in the US, he remains an elusive figure for many cinephiles. He appears in Resnais' ''[[Toute la mémoire du monde]]'' (1956) and in Marker's ''Immemory'' CD-Rom; he wrote ''China'' (1956) for Marker's ''Petite Planète'' collection and traveled with Marker in the making of ''[[Letter from Siberia]]'' (1957), which inspired his book ''Siberia — Zero + Infinity'' the following year.

According to his 1989 biographer, [[Dorothy Knowles (academic)|Dorothy Knowles]], Gatti was born in 1924 in a [[shantytown]] in [[Monaco]] to Auguste Rainier an Italian anarchist from [[Piedmont]], who escaped murder in a [[Chicago]] slaughterhouse because of his political activities and fled [[Benito Mussolini]]'s regime and to Letizia Lusona a maid.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lafosse|first1=Philippe|title=Eloge de la révolution|url=http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2001/02/LAFOSSE/1858|website=monde-diplomatique.fr|accessdate=24 October 2015}}</ref> During [[World War II]], Gatti joined a small [[French resistance]] [[Maquis (World War II)|maquis]]. Captured, tortured, and sentenced to a [[concentration camp]] in [[Hamburg]] where he was forced to work in a diving bell at the bottom of the [[Baltic Sea]], Gatti eventually escaped and joined a British [[Special Air Service]] [[special forces]] team. After the war, he worked as an award-winning journalist for many years until he traveled with Marker, published his first plays, and directed his first film, ''[[Enclosure (film)|Enclosure]]'' (''L'Enclos'', 1961).

L'Enclos was screened out of competition at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] but it was hailed by Truffaut, Resnais, Cocteau and others.

He was awarded the French [[Legion of Honour]] in 1999, the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] in 2004 and the Grand prix du théâtre from the [[Académie française]] in 2013.

He died on 6 April 2017.<ref>[http://www.lemonde.fr/disparitions/article/2017/04/06/mort-d-armand-gatti-figure-du-theatre-du-xxe-siecle_5106966_3382.html Mort d’Armand Gatti, figure du théâtre du XXe siècle] {{in lang|fr}}</ref>
