==Career==

===Writing===
[[File:Sam Shepard.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Shepard at age 21]]
Shepard moved to New York City in 1963 and found work as a busboy at the [[Village Gate]] nightclub. The following year, the Village Gate's head waiter, Ralph Cook, founded the experimental stage company [[Theatre Genesis|Theater Genesis]], housed at [[St. Mark's Church in-the-Bowery]] in Manhattan. Two of Shepard's earliest one-act plays, "The Rock Garden" and "Cowboys", debuted at Theater Genesis in October 1964. It was around this time that Steve Rogers adopted the professional name Sam Shepard.<ref name="Botting">{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/theatreofprotest0000bott |url-access=registration |title=The Theatre of Protest in America |publisher=Harden House |first=Gary |last=Botting |year=1972 |access-date=December 14, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730204911/http://www.thewittliffcollections.txstate.edu/research/a-z/shepard.html |archive-date=July 30, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In 1965, Shepard's [[one-act play]]s ''Dog'' and ''The Rocking Chair'' were produced at [[La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://catalog.lamama.org/index.php/Detail/Occurrence/Show/occurrence_id/147 |title=Production: 'Two One-Act Plays by Sam Shepard' (1965) |date=2015 |website=La MaMa Archives Digital Collections |access-date=August 29, 2018}}</ref> These were the first of many productions of Shepard's work at La MaMa during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.

Several of Shepard's early plays, including ''Red Cross'' (1966) and ''[[La Turista]]'' (1967), were directed by [[Jacques Levy]]. A patron of the [[Hotel Chelsea|Chelsea Hotel]] scene, he also contributed to [[Kenneth Tynan]]'s ''[[Oh! Calcutta!]]'' (1969) and drummed sporadically from 1967 through 1971 with the band [[The Holy Modal Rounders]], appearing on their albums ''[[Indian War Whoop]]'' (1967) and ''[[The Moray Eels Eat The Holy Modal Rounders]]'' (1968). After winning six [[Obie Award]]s between 1966 and 1968, Shepard emerged as a screenwriter with [[Robert Frank|Robert Frank's]] ''[[Me and My Brother (film)|Me and My Brother]]'' (1968) and [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s ''[[Zabriskie Point (film)|Zabriskie Point]]'' (1970).

''[[Cowboy Mouth (play)|Cowboy Mouth]]'', a collaboration with his then-lover [[Patti Smith]], was staged at [[The American Place Theatre]] in April 1971, providing early exposure for Smith, who became a well-known musician. The story and characters in ''Cowboy Mouth'' were inspired by Shepard and Smith's relationship. After opening night, he abandoned the production and fled to New England without a word to anyone involved.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~ma95/blackbrn/cmouth.html |title=Portrait of the Artist: Sam Shepard and the Anxiety of Identity |chapter=III.

Shortly thereafter, Shepard relocated with his wife and son to London. While in London, he immersed himself in the study of [[G.I. Gurdjieff]]'s [[Fourth Way]], a recurring preoccupation for much of his life. Returning to the United States in 1975, he moved to the 20-acre Flying Y Ranch in Mill Valley, California, where he raised a young colt named Drum and rode double with his young son on an [[appaloosa]] named Cody.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://newspaperarchive.com/san-rafael-daily-independent-journal-aug-19-1963-p-13/ |title=The Flying Y Ranch |date=August 19, 1963 |page=13 |newspaper=[[San Rafael Daily Independent Journal]] |quote=The Flying Y Ranch above Mill Valley is a popular place throughout the year with 4-H groups and Southern Marin Horsemen's Assn. members... |via=NewspaperARCHIVE.com |url-access=subscription}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mvhistory.org/history-of/history-of-homestead-valley/where-is-homestead-valley/ |title=Where is Homestead Valley? |first=Chuck |last=Oldenburg |date=July 2001 |website=Mill Valley Historical Society |access-date=August 16, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mvhistory.org/history-of/history-of-homestead-valley/4-h-valley-riders/ |title=4-H Valley Riders |first=Chuck |last=Oldenburg |date=August 2013 |website=Mill Valley Historical Society |access-date=August 16, 2018}}</ref><!-- <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.corporationwiki.com/California/Mill-Valley/flying-y-ranch-owners-association/41530436.aspx |title=Flying 'Y' Ranch Owners Association in Mill Valley CA - Company Profile |website=Corporation Wiki |access-date=August 16, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://patch.com/california/millvalley/then-and-now-flying-y-ranch-and-the-dipsea |title=Then and Now: Flying Y Ranch and the Dipsea |first=Tim |last=Amyx |date=June 21, 2011 |website=Patch.com |access-date=August 16, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.travelblog.org/North-America/United-States/blog-385663.html |title=A Horseback Ride With Ferlinghetti |first=Michael |last=Meteyer |date=March 29, 2009 |website=Travel Blog.org |access-date=August 16, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dipseabook.com/hike-dipsea.html |title=Dipsea - The Greatest Race, Centennial Edition by Barry Spitz |website=DipseaBook.com |access-date=August 16, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/marinij/obituary.aspx?n=lenard-walton&pid=184045112 |title=Obituary: Lenard Walton |date=February 7, 2017 |newspaper=[[Marin Independent Journal]] |access-date=August 16, 2018 |via=Legacy.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mvhistory.org/vignette-no-school-bus/ |title=No School Bus |date=February 19, 2015 |website=Mill Valley Historical Society |access-date=August 16, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.millvalleylibrary.net/historyroom/collections/items/show/110 |title=Lucretia Hanson Little History Room - Mill Valley Historical Society 2002 Spring Review |website=Mill Valley Library.net |access-date=August 16, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/name/sandy-young-obituary?pid=145404850 |title=Obituary: Sandy Young |date=September 17, 2010 |newspaper=[[East Bay Times]] |access-date=June 13, 2019 |via=Legacy.com}}</ref> --><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sam-shepard.com/jesseshepard.html |title=Jesse Mojo Shepard |website=Sam Shepard.com |access-date=August 16, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Sam-Shepard-s-kid-in-writing-game-Like-his-2668747.php |title=Sam Shepard's kid in writing game / Like his father's, Jesse's stories are filled with horses |first=Heidi |last=Benson |date=February 21, 2003 |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |access-date=August 16, 2018}}</ref> Shepard continued to write plays and served for a semester as Regents' Professor of Drama at the University of California, Davis.

Shepard accompanied [[Bob Dylan]] on the [[Rolling Thunder Revue]] of 1975 as the screenwriter for ''[[Renaldo and Clara]]'' that emerged from the tour. However, because much of the film was improvised, Shepard's work was seldom used. ''Rolling Thunder Logbook'', his diary of the tour, was published in 1978. A decade later, Dylan and Shepard co-wrote the 11-minute song "[[Brownsville Girl]]", included on Dylan's 1986 album ''[[Knocked Out Loaded]]'' and on later compilations.

In 1975, Shepard was named [[Artist-in-residence|playwright-in-residence]] at the [[Magic Theatre]] in San Francisco, where he created many of his notable works, including his [[Family Trilogy]]. One of the plays in the trilogy, ''[[Buried Child]]'' (1978), won the [[Pulitzer Prize]], and was nominated for five [[Tony Award]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/31/entertainment/sam-shepard-dies/index.html |title=Sam Shepard, playwright and actor, dead at 73 |last1=Chan |first1=Stella |last2=Thomas |first2=Megan |date=August 1, 2017 |work=CNN |access-date=June 13, 2019 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802032536/http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/31/entertainment/sam-shepard-dies/index.html |archive-date=August 2, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> This marked a major turning point in his career, heralding some of his best-known work, including ''[[True West (play)|True West]]'' (1980), ''[[Fool for Love (play)|Fool for Love]]'' (1983), and ''[[A Lie of the Mind]]'' (1985). A comic tale of reunion, in which a young man drops in on his grandfather's Illinois farmstead only to be greeted with indifference by his relations, ''Buried Child'' saw Shepard stake a claim to the psychological terrain of classic American theater.

In 2010, ''[[A Lie of the Mind]]'' was revived in New York at the same time as Shepard's new play ''Ages of the Moon'' opened there.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://theater.nytimes.com/2010/02/19/theater/reviews/19lie.html |title=Theater Review: Home Is Where the Soul Aches |first=Ben |last=Brantley |date=February 19, 2010 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=June 13, 2019 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225161908/http://theater.nytimes.com/2010/02/19/theater/reviews/19lie.html |archive-date=February 25, 2010 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> Reflecting on the two plays, Shepard said that the older play felt "awkward", adding, "All of the characters are in a fractured place, broken into pieces, and the pieces don't really fit together," while the newer play "is like a Porsche.

===Acting===
Shepard began his film acting career when cast in a major role as the land baron in [[Terrence Malick]]'s ''[[Days of Heaven]]'' (1978), opposite [[Richard Gere]] and [[Brooke Adams (actress)|Brooke Adams]].<ref name="bbc.com"/> This led to other important film roles, including that of Cal, [[Ellen Burstyn]]'s character's love interest in ''[[Resurrection (1980 film)|Resurrection]]'' (1980), and, most notably, Shepard's portrayal of [[Chuck Yeager]] in ''[[The Right Stuff (film)|The Right Stuff]]'' (1983). The latter performance earned Shepard an Academy Award nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]]. By 1986, ''[[Fool for Love (film)|Fool for Love]]'' was adapted by [[Robert Altman]] with Shepard in the lead role; ''A Lie of the Mind'' was being performed [[Off-Broadway]] (with [[Harvey Keitel]] and [[Geraldine Page]]); and Shepard was working steadily as a film actor.&nbsp;Together, these achievements put him on the cover of ''Newsweek''.

Over the years, Shepard taught extensively on playwriting and other aspects of theater. He gave classes and seminars at various theater workshops, festivals, and universities. Shepard was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] in 1986, and was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1986.<ref name="AAAS">{{cite web |url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterS.pdf |title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter S |website=[[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] |access-date=April 22, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730204911/http://www.thewittliffcollections.txstate.edu/research/a-z/shepard.html |archive-date=July 30, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> In 2000, Shepard demonstrated his gratitude to the Magic Theatre by staging ''[[The Late Henry Moss]]'' as a benefit for the theatre, in San Francisco. The cast included [[Nick Nolte]], [[Sean Penn]], [[Woody Harrelson]], and [[Cheech Marin]]. The limited, three-month run was sold out. In 2001, Shepard played General [[William F. Garrison]] in the film ''[[Black Hawk Down (film)|Black Hawk Down]]''. Although he was cast in a supporting role, Shepard enjoyed renewed interest in his talent for screen acting.

Shepard performed [[Spalding Gray]]'s final monologue ''Life Interrupted'' for the audiobook version, released in 2006. In 2007, Shepard contributed banjo to Patti Smith's cover of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s song "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]" on her album ''[[Twelve (Patti Smith album)|Twelve]]''. Although many artists had an influence on Shepard's work, one of the more significant was [[Joseph Chaikin]], a veteran of [[The Living Theatre]] and founder of [[The Open Theater]].<ref name="Botting" /> The two worked together on various projects, and Shepard has stated that Chaikin was a valuable mentor.

In 2011, Shepard starred in the film ''[[Blackthorn (film)|Blackthorn]]''. His final film appearance is ''[[Never Here]]'', which premiered in June 2017 but had been filmed in fall 2014.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.backstage.com/casting/you-were-never-here-50117/ |title=Feature Films: 'You Were Never Here' |date=November 2014 |magazine=[[Backstage (magazine)|Backstage]] |access-date=June 13, 2019 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802081105/https://www.backstage.com/casting/you-were-never-here-50117/ |archive-date=August 2, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> Shepard also appeared in the television series ''[[Bloodline (TV series)|Bloodline]]'' from 2014 to 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sam-shepard.com/bloodline.html |title=Bloodline |website=The Sam Shepard Web Site |access-date=June 13, 2019}}</ref>

===Directing===
At the beginning of his career, Shepard did not direct his own plays. His early plays had a number of different directors, but were most frequently directed by Ralph Cook, the founder of [[Theatre Genesis]]. Later, while living at the Flying Y Ranch, Shepard formed a successful playwright-director relationship with [[Robert Woodruff (director)|Robert Woodruff]], who directed the premiere of ''[[Buried Child]]'' (1982). During the 1970s, Shepard decided that his vision for his plays required him to direct them himself. He directed many of his own plays from that point onward. With only a few exceptions, he did not direct plays by other playwrights. He also directed two films but reportedly did not see film directing as a major interest.

==Personal life==
When Shepard first arrived in New York City, he roomed with Charlie Mingus, Jr., a friend from high school and the son of jazz musician [[Charles Mingus]]. He then lived with actress Joyce Aaron. From 1969 to 1984, he was married to actress [[O-Lan Jones]], with whom he had one son, Jesse Mojo Shepard (born 1970). From 1970 to 1971, Shepard was involved in an extramarital affair with musician [[Patti Smith]], who remained unaware of Shepard's identity as a multiple [[Obie Award]]-winning playwright until it was divulged to her by [[Jackie Curtis]]. Smith said "Me and his wife still even liked each other. I mean, it wasn't like committing adultery in the suburbs or something."<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.oceanstar.com/patti/bio/shepard2.htm |title=Mapplethorpe: A Biography |chapter=Patti Smith and Sam Shepard |last=Morrisroe |first=Patricia |date=1995 |via=Ocean Star}}</ref>

[[Joni Mitchell]] wrote two songs about her affairs with Shepard during Bob Dylan's [[Rolling Thunder Revue]] tour of 1975. In "[[Coyote (song)|Coyote]]" she recounts Shepard's seduction of Mitchell at a period while he was both married and having an extramarital affair with the tour manager Christine O’Dell with the lines “He’s got a woman at home, another woman down the hall, but he seems to want me anyway.” <ref>David Yaffe, Reckless Daughter - A Portrait of Joni Mitchell, p204, 2019, Sarah Crichton Books</ref>

Shepard met actress [[Jessica Lange]] on the set of the 1982 film ''[[Frances (film)|Frances]]'', in which they were both acting. He moved in with her in 1983, and they were together for 27 years; they separated in 2009.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/rep-jessica-lange-and-sam-shepard-have-separated-20111912 |title=Rep: Jessica Lange and Sam Shepard Have Separated |magazine=[[Us Weekly]] |first=Zach |last=Johnson |date=December 19, 2011 |access-date=May 22, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320235223/http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/rep-jessica-lange-and-sam-shepard-have-separated-20111912 |archive-date=March 20, 2012 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> They had two children, Hannah Jane Shepard (born 1986) and Samuel Walker Shepard (born 1987).
