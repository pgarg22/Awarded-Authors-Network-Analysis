'''Nestor Vasilievich Kukolnik''' ({{lang-ru|Нестор Васильевич Кукольник}}) (1809–1868) was a [[Russian Empire|Russian]] playwright and prose writer of [[Rusyns|Carpatho-Rusyn]] origin. Immensely popular during the early part of his career, his works were subsequently dismissed as sententious and sentimental. Today, he is best remembered for having contributed to the [[libretto]] of the first Russian opera, ''[[A Life for the Tsar]]'' by [[Mikhail Glinka]].  Glinka also set many of his lyrics to music.

==Family background==
Nestor Kukolnik was born on September 8, 1809 in the city of [[Saint Petersburg]] in the family of a professor lecturing at the Saint Petersburg Teacher's College. His father, [[Bazyli Wojciech Kukolnik]] belonged to the ethnic group of [[Rusyns]] (Ruthenians) and came from an old noble family. Graduate of [[Vienna University]], he lectured at [[Poland]]. In 1804, Bazyli Wojciech Kukolnik was invited to teach in Russia along with professors [[Ivan Orlay]] (Orlay János) and [[Mikhail Balugjanskij]]. Among his pupils were [[Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia]] and [[Nicholas I of Russia|Grand Duke Nikolai Pavlovich of Russia]], the future emperor Nikolai I of Russia; Czar [[Alexander I of Russia]] granted Vasily Kukolnik an estate in the [[Vilno]] Oblast and was Nestor Kukolnik's [[godparent|godfather]] at his baptism.

==Early life and studies==
Nestor studied at the [[Nizhyn]] Gymnasium of Higher Sciences (present-day [[Ukraine]]), founded earlier by Nestor's father. [[Nikolai Gogol]] studied at the same institution and they both played at the school theater. Kukolnik's literature activity started in gymnasium, where he wrote his first verses and dramas. After graduating from [[Nizhyn]] Gymnasium in 1829, he gave lessons at [[Vilnius Gymnasium]], and in 1831 moved with his brother Platon Kukolnik to [[Saint Petersburg]], where he served at the Ministry of Finance.

==Literary activity==
In 1833 Kukolnik's first play “Tortini” was published by [[Faddei Bulgarin]], soon followed by fantasy drama “Torcuato Tasso”, which resulted in his reputation as a legendary playwright in the capital. The turning point in his literary career came in 1834, after demonstration of patriotic drama "Ruka Vsevishnego Otechestvo Spasla" (The God's Hand Saved The Motherland), applauded by the Russian Emperor [[Nicolas I]] at the play's premiere. Inspired by this success, the writer produces historical play “Prince Mikhail Vasilievich Skopin-Shuysky”. In 1836 he founded The Gazette of Fine Arts (Khudozhestvennaia gazeta) which was published in [[Saint Petersburg]] until 1842 and wrote more than two hundred articles on art.

Kukolnik's oeuvre is diverse. He experimented with multiple genres and formats: novels, historical tales, criticism, poetry and even music. He was a friend of [[Mikhail Glinka]], who to set some of Kukolnik's verses (''Hesitation'', ''Skylark'', and ''Passing Song'', among others) to music. Dizzy from his success, he proclaimed that there were only three geniuses in Russia - himself as a writer, [[Mikhail Glinka]] as a composer, and [[Karl Briullov]] as a painter.

==Resignation and later life in Taganrog==
In 1857 Nestor Kukolnik resigned and settled in [[Taganrog]]. There he continued his literary activity, but the public work played the key role of his life in that period. Nestor Vasilievich did a lot of work for education of [[Taganrog]]'s society. It had an influence on the destiny of the city, making it into the centre of education in the South of Russia.

Nestor Kukolnik was the first to prove the need of university education in the [[Don Voisko Province]] and on [[Azov Sea]]. His offer to open a university in [[Taganrog]] was not successful, but later it proved to be an important foundation for opening the [[Novorossiya]] University in [[Odessa]] (1865). Kukolnik also proved necessity of local newspapers. It was one of the reasons to open newspaper-publishing houses not only in [[Taganrog]], but also in [[Odessa]] and [[Rostov on Don]]. Since 1865 Nestor Kukolnik led the workgroup that proved necessity of a railroad line from [[Kharkov]] to [[Taganrog]]. This work was a success and the Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]] approved the project in 1868. He also was the first to raise the issue of environmental protection of the [[Gulf of Taganrog]]. But the related project encountered strong resistance from regional leadership and was not realized. Nestor Vasilievich assisted in opening the county court in [[Taganrog]], open soon after his death in 1869.

Kukolnik died unexpectedly in Taganrog on December 8, 1868, when he and his wife were getting ready to go to the theatre. The writer was buried in Taganrog in his own estate.

In 1931 the remains of Nestor Kukolnik and his wife were defiled. Searching for jewelry, robbers opened the graves and threw away the remains. Unfortunately, it was not the only case of violation. In 1966 the city administration signed a decree and allowed the Public Joint-Stock Company “The Taganrog Boiler-Making Works “Krasny Kotelshchik” to build additional industrial areas on the territory of Kukolnik's estate.  All the works started two years later, in 1968. Bulldozers razed to the ground Kukolnik's house and mixed his grave with mud and debris. The remains of the great Russian writer have been lost forever.

In 2008 within the framework of the writer's 200th birth anniversary, one of the streets in Taganrog was named after Kukolnik.<ref>Решение Городской Думы города Таганрога №560 от 29.11.2007</ref>

==Trivia==

The word "kukolnik (кукольник)" is Russian for "puppeteer" or "puppet-maker".<ref>[http://slovari.yandex.ru/%D0%BA%D1%83%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA/%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B4/#lingvo/ Яндекс.Словари]</ref>

In Dostoyevsky's novel ''[[Demons (Dostoyevsky novel)|Demons]]'', the character of Varvara Petrovna Stavrogin uses Kukolnik (as portrayed in Briullov's portrait above) as the model for her idealized presentation of Stepan Verkhovensky.<ref>Dostoevsky, Fyodor.
