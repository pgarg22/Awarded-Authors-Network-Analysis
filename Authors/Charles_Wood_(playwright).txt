His work has been staged at the [[Royal National Theatre]] as well as at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] and in the theatres of the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]. He was elected a fellow of the [[Royal Society of Literature]] in 1984. Wood served in the [[17th/21st Lancers]] and military themes are found in many of his works.

==Biography==
Though he was born in the British Crown dependency of [[Guernsey]]&mdash;his parents were actors in a repertory company playing in Guernsey at the time&mdash;he left the island with his parents when he was still only an infant. His parents worked as actors in repertory and fit-ups (travelling theatrical groups) mainly in the north of England and [[Wales]] and had no fixed place of abode. His education was, until the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]], sporadic. The family settled in [[Chesterfield, Derbyshire|Chesterfield]], [[Derbyshire]], in 1939. The first house they rented was 1 Cromwell Road and the second was 20 Abercrombie Street. He attended [[St Mary's Catholic High School, Chesterfield|St Mary's Catholic Primary School]] from which he was awarded a Special Place at [[Brookfield Community School, Chesterfield|Chesterfield Grammar School]].

At the war's end, the family relocated to [[Kidderminster]] in Worcestershire where Charles Wood obtained a place at [[King Charles I School|King Charles I Grammar School]]. He was by now old enough to work in the theatre managed by his father Jack Wood. This was The Playhouse, later demolished. He worked as a stagehand and electrician and assistant to scenic artists in his spare time at weekends and every night. He also played small parts in the repertory company produced by his father. His mother Mae Harris was a leading actress in the company. In 1948, Wood gained entrance to [[Birmingham School of Art]] to study theatrical design and lithography.

Wood joined the [[British Army|Army]] in 1950, and served five years with the [[17th/21st Lancers]] and seven years on reserve. He was discharged with the rank of corporal, reduced to trooper on entering the Regular Army Reserve.

He married Valerie Newman, an actress, in 1954. She was working in repertory in a theatre at [[Worcester, England|Worcester]], the Theatre Royal, once the second oldest working theatre in the country.

On leaving the Army, Wood worked as an electronic wireman at [[British Aircraft Corporation|BAC]], [[Filton]] near Bristol. Later he worked as a scenic artist, layout artist, stage manager in England and [[Canada]]. He returned to Bristol with a job in the advertising department at the ''[[Bristol Post|Bristol Evening Post]]'' (at the same time [[Tom Stoppard]] was a journalist at the newspaper) until 1963 when he became a full-time writer.<ref>Dawn Fowler & [[John Lennard]] "On War: Charles Wood’s Military Conscience", in [[Mary Luckhurst]] (ed) ''Blackwell’s Companion to Modern British and Irish Drama'', 2006, Oxford & New York: Blackwell, pp. 341–57</ref>

==Writings==
Wood wrote his first play, ''Prisoner and Escort'', in 1959. It was a play for television which was first performed on radio, then on the stage and later on television. ''Cockade'' won the [[Evening Standard Theatre Awards#Most Promising Playwright|''Evening Standard'' Theatre Award]] for Most Promising New Writer in 1963.

Wood's work is known for its concern with British military life. In his preface to Wood's ''Plays One'', director [[Richard Eyre]] commented: "There is no contemporary writer who has chronicled the experience of modern war with so much authority, knowledge, compassion, wit and despair, and there is no contemporary writer who has received so little of his deserved public acclaim." Critics applauded his earliest plays such as ''Cockade'' (1963) for the details of military life, and his use of military argot and vernacular. He  explored many aspects of contemporary military life. ''Drill Pig'' (1964) was a black comedy about a young man who joins the army to escape his civilian life and his wife and her parents. ''Don't Make Me Laugh'' exposed military and civilian attitudes through the home life of a sergeant, his wife and their lodger. ''Death Or Glory Boy'' (1974) was a semi-autobiographical TV series about a grammar school boy joining the army.

His work also covered warfare during many different periods of British military history. Wood's plays have been described as "pro-soldier and anti-war".<ref>British TV Drama in the 1980s, ed George W. Brandt; Geoffrey Reeves, "Tumbledown and The Falklands Play p156</ref> He was concerned with the experiences of fighting soldiers rather than patriotism or heroism. ''Dingo'' (1967) was a black comedy attacking British myths and cliches about WWII. Wood wrote the script for the film of ''[[The Charge of the Light Brigade (1968 film)|The Charge Of The Light Brigade]]'' (1968) after [[John Osborne]] had been sued for plagiarising Cecil Woodham-Smith's ''The Reason Why''.<ref>John Heilpern, John Osborne: A Patriot for Us, p. 347</ref> ''H, Being Monologues at Front of Burning Cities'' (1969) was a historical pageant about Sir [[Henry Havelock]]'s military campaign during the Indian Mutiny of 1857. ''Jingo'' (1975) was about the fall of Singapore and the symbolic end of British dominance in East Asia. The television film ''[[Tumbledown]]'' (1988), directed by Richard Eyre, was the story of [[Robert Lawrence (British Army officer)|Robert Lawrence]] [[Military Cross|MC]], written  after many interviews with Robert Lawrence. (Lawrence later wrote his own version of his story called ''When the Fighting is Over''.) Wood wrote an episode of ''[[Kavanagh QC]]'' ("Mute of Malice", 1997) about an army chaplain traumatised by his experiences in Bosnia. He adapted numerous novels about war into film and television scripts including ''[[How I Won the War]]'' (1967) from a novel by [[Patrick Ryan (author and journalist)|Patrick Ryan]]; ''[[The Long Day's Dying]]'' (1968) from a novel by [[Alan White (novelist)|Alan White]]; ''[[A Breed of Heroes]]'' (1994) from a novel by [[Alan Judd]] about a young British officer in Belfast; and three episodes of ''[[Sharpe (TV series)|Sharpe]]''.

Many of his works have a semi-autobiographical element, employing his personal and professional life as a writer, working in theatre and movies. '' Last Summer By The Seaside'' (1964) was a documentary / ''cinema verite'' commentary about the English at play on the beach written and narrated by Charles Wood about his family on their annual holiday visit to his parents on the Isle of Wight. ''Fill the Stage With Happy Hours'' (1966) was a comedy about a run-down repertory theatre. ''A Bit of a Holiday'' (1969) which starred  George Cole as the writer Gordon Maple rewriting a historical screenplay in Rome was inspired by the filming of ''[[The Adventures of Gerard]]''.<ref>"Charles Wood: In and Out of Mufti." John Russell Taylor, ''Plays and Players'', 18 (1970)</ref> ''Veterans; or, Hair in the Gates of the Hellespont'' drew on the filming of ''The Charge of the Light Brigade'' with [[John Gielgud]] playing a character based on John Gielgud. ''Has "Washington" Legs?'' (1978) was written for America's bicentennial celebrations and was another comedy about film-making. ''A Bit Of An Adventure'' (1974) was about the life of writer Gordon Maple as played by [[George Cole (actor)|George Cole]]. Cole played George Maple again in two series of Wood's sitcom ''[[Don't Forget to Write!]]'' (1977 and 1979) about the frustrations of a writer's life. ''Across from the Garden of Allah'' (1985) was a comedy about an unsuccessful English screenwriter in Hollywood.
While Wood remained active in the theatre, a string of television dramas followed in the 1970s. The first of these was also perhaps the strangest: ''The Emergence of Anthony Purdy Esq, Farmer’s Labourer'' was an experimental piece starring Freddie Jones and Judy Matheson, about which little else is known, bar that it was made by Harlech, the ITV company for the South Wales and Western England region, and was ITV’s drama entry at the Monte Carlo TV festival. It was not widely networked, which is perhaps unsurprising in light of the comment by ''The Guardian''’s critic Nancy Banks-Smith that it was “completely incomprehensible to anyone east of Somerset”. 
Because Wood lived in Bristol as his writing career was starting, many of his early works were written about Bristol and also staged there. At that time other rising playwrights such as [[Peter Nichols (playwright)|Peter Nichols]] and [[Tom Stoppard]] lived there. ''Meals On Wheels'' (1965) was an experimental satire about provincial conservatism and repression which was to have been performed at the [[Bristol Old Vic]] but interference from Bristol Council meant it was rejected.<ref>Gambit interview, 1970</ref> ''Drums Along the Avon'' (1967) was a TV play about racial integration in Bristol which had to be broadcast with a disclaimer that "it is a fantasy and we devoutly hope that no one in Bristol will see it otherwise".<ref>Giving Offence, Stuart Wood, ''The Spectator'' 2 June 1967</ref> Wood had submitted ''Dingo'' to the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre Company]], but the Chamberlain's rejection of licence meant it could not be performed there, so Bristol Arts Centre staged the play under club membership conditions to circumvent censorship.

Wood had productive relationships with leading individuals in the British film and theatre industry. He worked numerous times with [[Richard Lester]]. Their first collaboration was on the film ''[[The Knack ...and How to Get It]]'' (1965) when the producer [[Oscar Lewenstein]] recommended Wood write the adaptation.<ref>Getting Away With It, Steven Soderbergh</ref> He worked again with Lester on the screenplay for ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'' (1965) and ''[[How I Won the War]]'' (1967), adapted from the [[Patrick Ryan (author and journalist)|Patrick Ryan]] novel and featuring some of the material from Wood’s play ''Dingo''. His other screenplays for Richard Lester were ''[[The Bed-Sitting Room (film)|The Bed Sitting Room]]'' (1969), from the [[Spike Milligan]] play, and ''[[Cuba (film)|Cuba]]'' (1969). Inspired by stories by [[Yuri Krotkov]], Wood wrote for Lester a script about the catastrophes suffered by a Russian actor who bears an uncanny resemblance to Stalin, but when financing fell through it was performed as ''Red Star'' by the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1984.<ref>Charles Wood, ''Plays 3'', p. 160</ref> Wood first worked with the director [[Richard Eyre]] when he directed the stage play ''Jingo'' (1975). Richard Eyre directed Wood’s television film ''[[Tumbledown]]'' (1988). Wood cowrote with Eyre the scripts for Eyre’s films '' [[Iris (2001 film)|Iris]]'' (2001) and ''[[The Other Man (2008 film)|The Other Man]]'' (2008). Wood wrote the screenplays for three films about composers directed by [[Tony Palmer]]: ''[[Wagner (film)|Wagner]]'' Channel 4 (1983); ''Puccini'' Channel 4 (1984); and ''[[England, My England]]'' Channel 4 ( 1995), completing John Osborne's screenplay about Purcell after it had been abandoned owing to Osborne's terminal illness.

Though Wood's plays are rarely revived, his play ''Jingo'' was produced by [[Primavera Productions|Primavera]] at the [[Finborough Theatre]] in March 2008, directed by [[Tom Littler]]. ''Jingo'', subtitled ''A Farce of War'', is set during the last days of British control of Singapore before the humiliating surrender to the Japanese. [[Susannah Harker]] played Gwendoline and [[Anthony Howell (actor)|Anthony Howell]] her ex-husband Ian.
