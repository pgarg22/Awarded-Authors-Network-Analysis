'''Bruce Andrews''' (April 1, 1948) is an [[United States poetry|American poet]] who is one of the key figures associated with the [[Language poets]] (or ''[[L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E (magazine)|L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E]]'' ''poets'', after the magazine that bears that name).

==Life and work==
Andrews was born in [[Chicago]] and studied international relations at [[Johns Hopkins University]] and political science at [[Harvard University|Harvard]]. His first book, ''Edge'', was published in 1973.

===Language poetry===
Together with [[Charles Bernstein]], he edited ''[[L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E (magazine)|L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E]]'' Magazine, which ran to 13 issues between 1978 and 1981 and (along with other magazines such as ''[[This (magazine)|This]]'', ''A Hundred Posters,'' ''Big Deal,'' ''Dog City,'' ''Hills,'' ''LÃ  Bas,'' ''Oculist Witnesses,'' ''QU,'' and ''Roof'') was one of the most important outlets for Language poetry. In 1984 he and Bernstein published most of the contents of the 13 issues in ''The L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E Book''.

Andrews rejects the classical notion of poetry as the 'direct treatment' of things in language, arguing that the only thing that can be so treated is language itself.

===Andrews and politics===
Andrews was a professor of political science at [[Fordham University]] from 1975 to 2013. He harshly criticized what he called the US government's policies of oppression and subversion.

Andrews appeared on the [[O'Reilly Factor]] in November 2006 after a Fordham student who interned on the program complained about Andrews' leftist views.

===Publications===
Andrews has published about forty books of poetry, either on his own or in collaboration with other writers, as well as a number of books of essays. His books include ''I Don't Have Any Paper So Shut Up (Or, Social Romanticism)'' (1992) and ''Ex Why Zee: Performance Texts, Collaborations with Sally Silvers, Word Maps, Bricolage & Improvisation'' (1995). ''Designated Heartbeat'' ([[Salt Publishing]], 2006; {{ISBN|1-84471-068-8}}) and  ''Swoon Noir'' (Chax Press, 2007; {{ISBN|978-0-925904-48-5}}) bring Andrews well into the 21st century.
