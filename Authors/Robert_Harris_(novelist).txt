}}
'''Robert Dennis Harris''' (born 7 March 1957) is an English [[novelist]] and former [[journalism|journalist]]. Although he began his career in journalism and [[non-fiction]], his fame rests upon his works of [[historical fiction]]. Beginning with the best-seller ''[[Fatherland (novel)|Fatherland]]'', Harris focused on events surrounding the [[Second World War]], followed by works set in [[Roman Empire|ancient Rome]]. His most recent works centre on contemporary history. Harris was educated at [[Selwyn College, Cambridge]], where he was president of the [[Cambridge Union]] and editor of the student newspaper ''[[Varsity (Cambridge)|Varsity]]''.

==Early life and education==
Robert Harris spent his childhood in a small rented house on a [[Nottingham]] [[council estate]]. His ambition to become a writer arose at an early age, from visits to the local printing plant where his father worked. Harris went to [[Belvoir High School]] in [[Bottesford, Leicestershire|Bottesford]], [[Leicestershire]],<ref name="ES">{{cite news|last1=Curtis|first1=Nick|title=Battle of the blokebusters: William Boyd v Robert Harris|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/battle-of-the-blokebusters-william-boyd-v-robert-harris-8823872.html|access-date=20 February 2018|work=Evening Standard|date=18 September 2013}}</ref> and then [[King Edward VII School (Melton Mowbray)|King Edward VII School]], [[Melton Mowbray]], where a hall was later named after him. There he wrote plays and edited the school magazine. Harris read English literature at [[Selwyn College, Cambridge]], where was elected president of the [[Cambridge Union]] and editor of ''[[Varsity (Cambridge)|Varsity]]'', the oldest [[student newspaper]] at [[Cambridge University]].

==Career==
===Early career===
After leaving [[Cambridge]], Harris joined the [[BBC]] and worked on news and current affairs programmes such as ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' and ''[[Newsnight]]''. In 1987, at age 30, he became political editor of the newspaper ''[[The Observer]]''. He later wrote regular columns for ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' and ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.

=== Non-fiction (1982–1990) ===
Harris's first book, ''A Higher Form of Killing'' (1982) with fellow BBC journalist [[Jeremy Paxman]], was a study of [[chemical warfare|chemical]] and [[biological warfare]]. Other [[non-fiction]] works followed: ''Gotcha! The Government, the Media and the Falklands Crisis'' (1983) covering the [[Falklands War]]; ''The Making of [[Neil Kinnock]]'' (1984); ''[[Selling Hitler]]'' (1986), an investigation of the [[Hitler Diaries]] scandal; and ''Good and Faithful Servant'' (1990), a study of [[Bernard Ingham]], [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s press secretary.

===Fiction===
{{Alternate history sidebar}}
;''Fatherland'' (1992)
Harris's bestselling first novel, the [[Alternate history|alternative-history]] ''[[Fatherland (novel)|Fatherland]]'', has as its setting a world where [[Nazi Germany]] won the Second World War. Publication enabled Harris to become a full-time novelist. [[Home Box Office (HBO)|HBO]] [[Fatherland (1994 film)|made a film]] based on the novel in 1994.

Harris stated that the proceeds from the book enabled him to buy a house in the country, where he still lives.

;''Enigma'' (1995)
His second novel ''[[Enigma (novel)|Enigma]]'' portrayed the breaking of the German [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] code during the Second World War at [[Cambridge University]] and [[Bletchley Park]]. It went on to become a major [[Enigma (2001 film)|film]], with [[Dougray Scott]] and [[Kate Winslet]] starring and with a screenplay by [[Tom Stoppard]].

;''Archangel'' (1998)
''[[Archangel (Robert Harris novel)|Archangel]]'' was another international best seller. It follows a British historian in contemporary Russia as he hunts for a secret notebook, believed to be [[Stalin]]'s diary. In 2005 the BBC made it into a mini-series starring [[Daniel Craig]].

;''Pompeii'' (2003)
In 2003 Harris turned his attention to [[ancient Rome]] with his acclaimed ''[[Pompeii (novel)|Pompeii]].'' The novel is about a [[Roman aqueduct]] engineer, working near the city of [[Pompeii]] just before the eruption of [[Vesuvius]] in 79 AD. As the aqueducts begin to malfunction, he investigates and realises the volcano is shifting the ground beneath and is near eruption. Meanwhile, he falls in love with the young daughter of a powerful local businessman who was illicitly dealing with his predecessor to divert municipal water for his own uses, and will do anything to keep that deal going.

;''Imperium'' (2006)
He followed this in 2006 with ''[[Imperium (Harris novel)|Imperium]]'', the first novel in a trilogy centered on the life of the great Roman orator [[Cicero]].

;''The Ghost'' (2007)
Harris was an early and enthusiastic supporter of [[Tony Blair]] (a personal acquaintance) and a donor to [[New Labour]], but the [[war in Iraq]] blunted his enthusiasm.<ref name="observer.com">[http://www.observer.com/2007/blair-snitch-project-thriller-pulps-britain-s-ex-prime-minister] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328044443/http://www.observer.com/2007/blair-snitch-project-thriller-pulps-britain-s-ex-prime-minister |date=28 March 2008 }}</ref> "We had our ups and downs, but we didn't really fall out until the invasion of Iraq, which made no sense to me," Harris has said.<ref>{{cite web|last=Harris |first=Robert |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15776253 |title=Robert Harris: 'The Ghost' of Tony Blair |publisher=NPR |access-date=2015-12-09}}</ref> 

In 2007, after Blair resigned, Harris dropped his other work to write ''[[The Ghost (novel)|The Ghost]]''. The title refers both to a professional [[ghostwriter]], whose lengthy memorandum forms the novel, and to his immediate predecessor who, as the action opens, has just drowned in gruesome and mysterious circumstances. The dead man has been ghosting the autobiography of a recently unseated British prime minister called Adam Lang, a thinly veiled version of Blair.<ref>{{cite news|author=Anthony Holden |url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/generalfiction/0,,2180093,00.html |title=Review: The Ghost by Robert Harris |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=2015-12-09}}</ref> The fictional counterpart of [[Cherie Blair]] is depicted as a sinister manipulator of her husband. Harris told ''[[The Guardian]]'' before publication: "The day this appears a [[writ]] might come through the door. But I would doubt it, knowing him."<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/sep/27/books.generalfiction | work=The Guardian | first=Aida | last=Edemariam | title=Aida Edemariam talks to author Robert Harris | date=27 September 2007 | location=London}}</ref>

Harris said in a U.S. [[National Public Radio]] interview that politicians like Lang and Blair, particularly when they have been in office for a long time, become divorced from everyday reality, read little and end up with a pretty limited overall outlook. When it comes to writing their memoirs, they therefore tend to have all the more need of a ghostwriter.

Harris hinted at a third, far less obvious, allusion hidden in the novel's title, and, more significantly, at a possible motive for having written the book in the first place. Blair, he said, had himself been ghostwriter, in effect, to President [[George W. Bush|Bush]] when giving public reasons for invading [[Iraq]]: he had argued the case better than had the President himself.<ref>National Public Radio interview, 31 October 2007.</ref>

The ''[[New York Observer]]'', headlining its otherwise hostile review ''The Blair Snitch Project'', commented that the book's "shock-horror revelation" was "so shocking it simply can't be true, though if it were it would certainly explain pretty much everything about the recent history of Great Britain."<ref name="observer.com" />

;''Lustrum'' (2009)
The second novel in the Cicero trilogy, ''[[Lustrum (novel)|Lustrum]]'', was published in October 2009. It was released in February 2010 in the US under the alternative title of ''Conspirata''.

;''The Fear Index'' (2011)
His novel ''[[The Fear Index]]'', focusing on the [[2010 Flash Crash]], was published by Hutchinson in September 2011. It follows an American expat hedge fund operator living in [[Geneva]] who activates a new system of computer algorithms that he names VIXAL-4, which is designed to operate faster than human beings, but which begins to become uncontrollable by its human operators.

;''An Officer and a Spy'' (2013)
''[[An Officer and a Spy]]'' is the story of French officer [[Georges Picquart]], a historical character, who is promoted in 1895 to run France's ''Statistical Section'', its secret intelligence division. He gradually realises that [[Alfred Dreyfus]] has been unjustly imprisoned for acts of espionage committed by another man who is still free and still spying for the Germans. He risks his career and his life to expose the truth.

;''Dictator'' (2015)
''[[Dictator (Harris novel)|Dictator]]'' is the long-promised conclusion to Harris's Cicero trilogy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://richardandjudy.whsmith.co.uk/bonus-content/authorqa/robertharrisanofficerandaspyauthorqa/ |title=Richard and Judy ask Robert Harris |publisher=W H Smith |access-date=22 April 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019070704/http://richardandjudy.whsmith.co.uk/bonus-content/authorqa/robertharrisanofficerandaspyauthorqa/ |archive-date=19 October 2014  }}</ref> It was published by Hutchinson on 8 October 2015.<ref name="amazon.co.uk">{{cite book|title=Dictator |author=Robert Harris |isbn=9780091752101 |year = 2015}}</ref>

===Work with Roman Polanski===
In 2007, Harris wrote a screenplay of his novel ''[[Pompeii (novel)|Pompeii]]'' for director [[Roman Polanski]]. Harris acknowledged in many interviews that the plot of his novel was inspired by Polanski's film ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'', and Polanski said it was precisely that similarity that had attracted him to ''Pompeii''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Beard |first=Matthew |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/polanski-to-bring-bestseller-on-last-days-of-pompeii-to-the-big-screen-434816.html |title=Polanski to bring best-seller on last days of Pompeii to the big screen &#124; News &#124; Culture |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=2007-02-03 |access-date=2015-12-09}}</ref> The film, to be produced by [[Summit Entertainment]], was announced at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 2007 as potentially the most expensive European film ever made, set to be shot in Spain. Media reports suggested Polanski wanted [[Orlando Bloom]] and [[Scarlett Johansson]] to play the two leads. The film was cancelled in September 2007 as a result of a looming actors' strike.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Dave McNary |author2=Alison James |author3=Dade Hayes |url=https://variety.com/2007/film/news/polanski-pulls-out-of-pompeii-2-1117971777/ |title=Polanski pulls out of 'Pompeii' |publisher=Variety |date=2007-09-11 |access-date=2015-12-09}}</ref>

Polanski and Harris then turned to Harris's bestseller, ''[[The Ghost (novel)|The Ghost]]''. They co-wrote a script and Polanski announced filming for early 2008, with [[Nicolas Cage]], [[Pierce Brosnan]], [[Tilda Swinton]] and [[Kim Cattrall]] starring. The film was then postponed by a year, with [[Ewan McGregor]] and [[Olivia Williams]] replacing Cage and Swinton.
The film, retitled ''[[The Ghost Writer (film)|The Ghost Writer]]'' in all territories except the UK, was shot in early 2009 in [[Berlin]] and on the island of [[Sylt]] in the [[North Sea]], which stood in for [[London]] and [[Martha's Vineyard]] respectively, owing to Polanski's inability to travel legally to those places. In spite of his incarceration, he oversaw post-production from his house arrest and the film premiered at the [[Berlin Film Festival]] in February 2010, with Polanski winning the [[Silver Bear for Best Director]] award. Harris and Polanski later shared a [[César Award]] for Best Adapted Screenplay.

Harris was inspired to write his novel ''[[An Officer and a Spy]]'' by Polanski's longtime interest in the [[Dreyfus affair]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Andrew Anthony |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/29/robert-harris-interview-officer-spy |title=Robert Harris: 'Whenever a crowd is running one way, I run the other' |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=2013-09-24 |access-date=2015-12-09}}</ref> He also wrote a screenplay based on the story, which Polanski was to direct in 2012.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/roman-polanski-dreyfus-affair-d-322555 | newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter | first=Pamela | last=McClintock | title=Roman Polanski to Direct Dreyfus Affair Drama 'D' | date=9 May 2012}}</ref> The screenplay was first titled ''D'', after the initial written on the secret file that secured Dreyfus' conviction. After many years of production difficulties, it started filming in November 2018 as ''J'accuse'', starring [[Jean Dujardin]] and co-starring [[Mathieu Amalric]] and [[Olivier Gourmet]]. It is produced by Alain Goldman and distributed by [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allocine.fr/article/fichearticle_gen_carticle=18675311.html|title=J'accuse : Jean Dujardin chez Roman Polanski pour son film sur l'affaire Dreyfus|last=AlloCine|website=AlloCiné}}</ref>

In June 2018 Harris reiterated his support for Polanski, and branded criticisms of Polanski's crimes as being a problem of culture and fashion "The culture has completely changed...And so the question is: "Do you then say, OK fine, I follow the culture.' Or do I say: 'Well, he hasn't done anything since then. He won the Oscar, he got a standing ovation in Los Angeles.' The zeitgeist has changed. Do you change with it? I don't know, to be honest with you. Morally, I don't see why I should change my position because the fashion has changed."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/robert-harris-roman-polanski-position-fashion-changed-marr-bbc-latest-a8414186.html|title=Robert Harris says he won't change position on Roman Polanski 'because the fashion has changed'|website=Independent.co.uk}}</ref>

===TV appearances and radio broadcasts===
Harris has appeared on the BBC satirical panel game ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'' in episode three of the first series in 1990, and in episode four of the second series a year later. In the first he appeared as a last-minute replacement for the politician [[Roy Hattersley]]. He made a third appearance on the programme on 12 October 2007, seventeen years, to the day, after his first appearance. Since the gap between his second and third appearance was nearly 16 years, Harris enjoyed the distinction of the longest gap between two successive appearances in the show's history until [[Eddie Izzard]] appeared on 22 April 2016,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b078dmkx|title=Episode 3, Series 51, Have I Got News for You – BBC One|website=BBC|access-date=6 May 2018}}</ref> just under 20 years after his last appearance on Episode 5 of Series 11 (17 May 1996).

On 2 December 2010, Harris appeared on the radio programme ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'', when he spoke about his childhood and his friendships with [[Tony Blair]] and [[Roman Polanski]].

Harris appeared on the American [[PBS]] show ''[[Charlie Rose (TV series)|Charlie Rose]]'' on 10 February 2012. Harris discussed his novel ''The Fear Index'' which he likened to a modern-day [[Gothic fiction|Gothic novel]] along the lines of [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]''. Harris also discussed the adaptation of his novel, ''The Ghost'' that came out as the movie, ''The Ghost Writer'' directed by Roman Polanski.<ref>[http://www.charlierose.com/guest/view/4771 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213202328/http://www.charlierose.com/guest/view/4771 |date=13 February 2012 }}</ref>

===Columnist===
Harris was a columnist for the ''[[Sunday Times]]'', but gave it up in 1997. He returned to journalism in 2001, writing for the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1339913/Robert-Harris-joins-Telegraph.html |title=Robert Harris joins |newspaper=[[Daily Telegraph]] |date=2001-09-08 |access-date=2015-12-09}}</ref> He was named "Columnist of the Year" at the 2003 [[British Press Awards]].<ref name="gazetteroll">[http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/hybrid.asp?typeCode=99&navcode=92# ]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616181807/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/hybrid.asp?typeCode=99&navcode=92 |date=16 June 2011 }}</ref>

== Personal life ==
Harris lives in a former vicarage in [[Kintbury]], near [[Hungerford]] in [[Berkshire]], with his wife Gill Hornby, herself a writer and sister of best-selling novelist [[Nick Hornby]]. They have four children. Harris contributed a short story, "PMQ", to Hornby's 2000 collection ''[[Speaking with the Angel]]''.

Formerly a donor to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], he renounced his support for the party after the appointment of ''Guardian'' journalist [[Seumas Milne]] as its communications director by leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/Jeremy_Corbyn/11951866/Exclusive-Jeremy-Corbyns-millionaire-spin-doctor-Seumas-Milne-sent-his-children-to-top-grammar-schools.html|title=Exclusive: Jeremy Corbyn's millionaire spin doctor Seumas Milne sent his children to top grammar schools|first=Gordon|last=Rayner|date=23 October 2015|access-date=6 May 2018|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref> He now supports the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/author-robert-harris-on-donald-trump-theresa-may-and-the-new-superelite-a3459361.html|title=Robert Harris on Donald Trump, Theresa May and the new super-elite}}</ref>
