'''Delferd Lynn Shores''' (born December 3, 1957) is an American film director and producer, television writer and producer, playwright and actor.

==Biography==
The first play Shores wrote was ''Cheatin''' which premiered in 1984 in Los Angeles at The MainStage Theatre.  His second play ''Daddy's Dyin': Who's Got the Will?'' saw a 1987 debut in Los Angeles at Theatre/Theater, running twenty-two months to critical acclaim. The comedic play was adapted for the [[1990 in film|1990]] film [[Daddy's Dyin': Who's Got the Will?|of the same title]].<ref name=NYT>{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|authorlink=Vincent Canby|first=Vincent|last=Canby|title=Daddy's Dyin': Who's Got the Will" (1990) Review/Film; Sibling Rivalries, Old and New|date=August 17, 1990|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C0CEFDE133EF934A2575BC0A966958260}}</ref> Shores wrote the screenplay and executive produced the feature.<ref>[http://www.delshores.net/html/about.php Delshores.net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121212213/http://www.delshores.net/html/about.php |date=2008-11-21 }}</ref>

Perhaps Shores' best known play is his fourth, ''Sordid Lives'', which debuted in 1996 in Los Angeles. The comedy centered on the Texan Ingram family and touched on [[LGBT]] themes. In [[1999 in film|1999]] Shores wrote and directed the screen version of ''[[Sordid Lives]]''. Eight years later Shores produced 12 [[prequel]] episodes of ''[[Sordid Lives: The Series]]'' which aired on American LGBT-interest cable channel [[Logo (TV channel)|Logo]] with a much-anticipated sequel, ''A Very Sordid Wedding'', premiering in 2016 with a mixture of the film and series cast, with [[Levi Kreis]], Emerson Collins, [[Katherine Bailess]], T. Ashanti Mozelle, [[Dale Dickey]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Alec Mapa]], and [[Carole Cook]] joining the cast.

In 2010, Shores debuted his play ''Yellow'' at the Coast Playhouse in West Hollywood. During that time, Shores lost his Hollywood Hills home to foreclosure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/theater/2010/06/11/dark-side-del-shores|title=The Dark Side of Del Shores|date=11 June 2010|website=Advocate.com}}</ref> The play was his most critically acclaimed play, winning Best Production of the Year and Best Original Play from the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle (LADCC).

Shores has two daughters, Caroline and Rebecca, from a previous marriage to Kelley Alexander.
