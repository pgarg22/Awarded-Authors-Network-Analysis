'''Takarai Kikaku''' ({{lang-ja|宝井其角}}; 1661–1707) also known as '''Enomoto Kikaku''', was a [[Japan]]ese [[haikai]] [[poet]] and among the most accomplished disciples of [[Matsuo Bashō]].<ref>''Eighteen Haiku by Kikaku, translated by Michael K. Bourdaghs'', in [http://www.nycbigcitylit.com/feb2004/contents/poetrybourdaghs.html Big City Lit, Feb 2004] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716125325/http://www.nycbigcitylit.com/feb2004/contents/poetrybourdaghs.html |date=2007-07-16 }}</ref><ref name=kato159>Katō, Shūichi and Sanderson, Don.

Kikaku set the tone for haikai from Basho  death until the time of [[Yosa Buson]] in the late 18th century;<ref name=kato159 /> and he also left an important historical document, describing Bashō's final days, and the immediate aftermath of his death, which has been translated into English.<ref>Takarai, Kikaku.

==Later influence==

In commemoration of the 300th anniversary of Kikaku's death, Nobuyuki Yuasa led an international bilingual (Japanese and English) [[renku]], or collaborative linked poem, which opened with the following [[hokku]] by Kikaku:<ref>Yuasa, Nobuyuki et al. ''Springtime in Edo''. Keisuisha, 2006. {{ISBN|4-87440-920-2}}, pp.3-9</ref>

:鐘ひとつ賣れぬ日はなし江戸の春

:Springtime in Edo,
:Not a day passes without
:A temple bell sold.

==Bashō's criticism==
*Kikaku wrote of coarser subjects than Bashō, and in this respect his poetry was closer to earlier haikai, as well as to [[senryu]],<ref>R H Blyth, ''A History of Haiku Vol I'' (1963) p. p. 132</ref> and his master is known to have denigrated Kikaku's 'flippant efforts'.

*Comparing Kikaku's paired haiku in 'The Rustic Haiku Contest', Bashō remarked of one that "these are artifices within a work of art; too much craft has been expended here".<ref>Makoto Ueda, ''Matsuo Bashō'' (1982) p. 153</ref>

*'''<nowiki>{{</nowiki>[[Template:Dubious|Dubious]]<nowiki>}}</nowiki>'''<br /> One day, Kikaku composed a haiku,
:''Red dragonfly / break off its wings / Sour cherry'' 
which Bashō changed to, 
:''Sour cherry / add wings to it / Red dragonfly''; 
thus saying that poetry should add life to life, not take life away from life.<ref>[http://www.midwestbookreview.com/rbw/oct_01.htm MBR: Reviewer's Bookwatch, October 2001<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.williammichaelian.com/conversation/conversation29.html The Conversation Continues - Page 28<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> '''<nowiki>{{</nowiki>[[Template:Dubious|Dubious]]<nowiki>}}</nowiki>'''
