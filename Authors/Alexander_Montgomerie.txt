[[File:Giambattista Basile.jpg|170px|right|thumb|Portrait of a courtier poet typical in Montgomerie's day]]

'''Alexander Montgomerie''' (c. 1550?&ndash;1598) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] courtier and poet, or [[makar]], born in [[Ayrshire]]. He was one of the principal members of the [[Castalian Band]], a circle of poets in the court of [[James I of England|James VI]] in the 1580s which included the king himself. Montgomerie was for a time in favour as one of the king's "favourites". He was a [[Catholic]] in a largely [[Protestant]] court and his involvement in political controversy led to his expulsion as an outlaw in the mid-1590s.

Montgomerie's poetry, much of which examines themes of [[love]], includes autobiographical sonnets and foreshadows the later [[metaphysical poets]] in [[England]]. He is sometimes, by tradition, given the epithet "Captain".

==Early life==

Montgomerie was a younger son of the Ayrshire [[laird]] Hugh Montgomerie of [[Hessilhead]] (d. 1558) and so was related to the [[Earl of Eglinton]],<ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Montgomerie, Alexander (1556?-1610?)|first=James |last=Cranstoun|volume=38}}</ref> and a distant relation of [[James VI of Scotland|James VI]].

Nothing is known for certain about his life before about 1580, but contemporary or near-contemporary accounts suggest that he was brought up as a member of the [[Church of Scotland]], spent some time in [[Argyll]] before leaving for the Continent, and was converted to Catholicism in Spain. He probably saw active service as a soldier for the Scottish forces in The Netherlands in the later 1570s, although there is no certain documentary evidence of this.

Montgomerie's arrival in Edinburgh may have been linked in some way to that of the king's Catholic, French-born kinsman [[Esmé Stewart, 1st Duke of Lennox|Esmé Stewart]], whose ascendancy at court coincides with the period of the poet's greatest prominence (1580–86).

==Works==

It is likely that his earliest surviving poems are ''The Navigation'' and the related ''Cartel of the Thre Ventrous Knichts'', which may well have been written for performance at court at Epiphany 1580. The ''Navigatioun'' involves the torchlit entrance at [[Holyrood Palace]] of a narrator and his companions, a "Turk, the More, and the Egyptien".<ref>David J. Parkinson, ''Alexander Montgomerie Poems'' (Scottish Text Society Edinburgh, 2000), pp. 90, 97.</ref> The court musicians were bought "mask claithis" comprising red and yellow taffeta with swords and daggers.<ref>Charles Thorpe McInnes, ''Accounts of the Treasurer, 1574-1580'', vol. 13 (Edinburgh, 1978), p. 301.</ref> Montgomerie's prologue alludes to the [[Magi]] and [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] to flatter James VI as the [[Polaris|Northern Star]]. James was also characterised as [[Solomon]]. The masque was followed by dancing.<ref>David J. Parkinson, ''Alexander Montgomerie Poems'', vol. 2 (Scottish Text Society Edinburgh, 2000), pp. 72-4, 78.</ref>

Montgomerie came to prominence as "laureled" leader of the Castalian Band, a circle of court poets headed by the King after being declared victor over a rival poet, [[Patrick Hume of Polwarth]], in a comically scurrilous [[flyting]], or poetic duel. The King, who was himself a practising member of the group, referred to Montgomerie as its 'maister poete'.

A number of Montgomerie's poems can be assigned to the first half of the 1580s, including sonnets, court songs, and the first, unfinished version of his longest work, the allegorical ''Cherrie and the Slae''. Like some other pieces, it may have been written (at least in part) by autumn 1584, for the 19-year-old king included a passage from it in his literary manifesto ''[[Some Reulis and Cautelis to be observit and eschewit in Scottis poesie]]'', published around September of that year.

==Courtier==

As early as 27 July 1583 Montgomerie was granted a pension by the king, drawn from the revenues of [[Glasgow Cathedral]]. His career had evidently survived the temporary imprisonment of James by a militant Protestant faction led by the [[Earl of Gowrie]], and the exile and death of Esmé Stewart, whom James had made [[Duke of Lennox]]. But there seems to have been a fundamental change in the culture of the court towards the end of 1585, when the king took personal control of the government, and in the summer of 1586 Montgomerie joined an enlarged Scottish contingent fighting for the [[Dutch Republic]] against the Spanish.

He stayed there for more than two years, serving at Zutphen at the same time as the unfortunate [[Sir Philip Sidney]], and eventually experiencing severe financial difficulties as a result of non-payment by the Dutch authorities. He eventually struck a deal with the States of Holland in February 1588, and was back in Scotland by the end of the year.

Life at court was now very different from what it had been before Montgomerie's departure, not least because of (justified) allegations of intrigue between leading Catholic aristocrats and the Spanish. On a more personal level, the poet's pension had been claimed by someone else during his absence, and a long legal struggle ended in defeat for Montgomerie in July 1593. This battle produced some of his most remarkable poetry, increasingly embittered sonnets encouraging, cajoling, and eventually attacking the judges and lawyers involved, and even the king himself. At the same time, he continued to write formal poems about life at court, while some undated songs and other verses may well also come from this period.

==Expulsion and death==

Mongomerie largely disappears from view after the collapse of his legal case, until he became involved, in late 1596 or early 1597, in a Catholic plot to seize the rocky outcrop of [[Ailsa Craig]], in the lower [[Firth of Clyde]], as support for a Spanish intervention in the [[Earl of Tyrone]]'s rebellion in Ireland. Led by Montgomerie's friend and fellow-poet [[Hugh Barclay of Ladyland]], this enterprise soon collapsed, Barclay being killed in the process, and on 14 July 1597 Montgomerie was declared an outlaw.

He may have planned to leave the country, perhaps to go to the Scottish Benedictine monastery in [[Würzburg]], but he was still in Scotland at the time of his death in August 1598. His death proved as controversial as much of his life, for the authorities of the [[Canongate Kirk]] in Edinburgh refused to allow him to be buried in the churchyard on the grounds of his Catholicism, only an intervention by the king himself forcing them to change their minds. Montgomerie's exact place of burial is unknown, but it must have been in the church or grounds of [[Holyrood Abbey]], which was then used by the Canongate congregation.

==Literary assessment==

Montgomerie's poetic output of over 100 pieces is mostly known from just one witness, the Ker manuscript, presented to [[Edinburgh University Library]] by the poet [[William Drummond of Hawthornden]]. It is possible that this was assembled from Montgomerie's papers soon after his death; it must, in any case, have been written soon afterwards.

The range of his work is extensive, from elegant court songs including ''Lyk as the dum [[Sunflower|Solsequium]]'' and ''Melancholie, grit deput of Dispair'' to the bitter, sometimes contorted word-play of the sonnets associated with the dispute over his pension, from witty pieces addressed to the king to the profound religious sensibility of ''A godly prayer'' and the extraordinary ''Come, my childrene dere''. Montgomerie is one of the finest of [[Middle Scots]] poets, and perhaps the greatest Scottish exponent of the [[sonnet]] form (although the twentieth-century poets [[Robert Garioch]] and [[Edwin Morgan (poet)|Edwin Morgan]] were also fine sonnetteers).

''The Cherrie and the Slae'', which he probably revised and completed shortly before his death, is an ambitious religious [[allegory]], employing a demanding, lyrical stanza form which suggests that it was intended for singing, despite its considerable length. His poetry reaches back to the earlier [[makar]]s, [[Robert Henryson|Henryson]], [[William Dunbar|Dunbar]] and [[Gavin Douglas|Doouglas]], but he also translates from [[Clément Marot]] and from [[Ronsard]], and some of his work invites comparison with [[Baroque]] writers such as [[Giambattista Marino|Marino]], [[Luis de Góngora|Góngora]], [[John Donne|Donne]] and [[George Herbert|Herbert]].
