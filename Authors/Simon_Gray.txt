==Biography==
Simon James Holliday Gray was born on 21 October 1936 on [[Hayling Island]], in [[Hampshire]], England to James Gray and his wife [[Barbara Holliday (athlete)|Barbara]] (née Holliday). His father, who later became a [[pathologist]], worked on the island as [[General practitioner|GP]].<ref name=TOLobit>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article4480324.ece|title=Simon Gray: Rakish and Versatile Playwright|work=[[The Times|The Times Online]], Obituaries|format=[[World Wide Web|Web]]|publisher=[[News Corporation (1980–2013)|News Corporation]]|date=8 September 2008|access-date=30 March 2009}}</ref> In 1939, during [[World War II]], when he was three years old, Simon and his elder brother Nigel were evacuated to [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada, to live in "a house where his grandfather and [his grandfather's] alcoholic wife were attended upon by a younger aunt"; in 1945, when he was nearly 10, he returned to England, where he was educated at [[Westminster School]], in London.<ref name=TOLobit/> In 1957, he received a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] from [[Dalhousie University]], [[Halifax Urban Area|Halifax, Nova Scotia]]; and, in 1961, another B.A. from [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].<ref name=TOLobit/><ref name=EB>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/242639/Simon-Gray|title=Simon Gray|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|format=[[World Wide Web|Web]]|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica|Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]|year=2009|access-date=7 April 2009}}</ref> In 1965, he was appointed a lecturer in English at [[Queen Mary, University of London|Queen Mary College]],  London.<ref name=Gardner/><ref name=TOLobit/>

He married his first wife, Beryl Kevern, in 1965; they had two children, a son, Benjamin, and a daughter, Lucy, and were divorced in 1997.<ref name=Weber/><ref name=TOLobit/> During their marriage, he had an eight-year affair with another [[Queen Mary, University of London|Queen Mary]] lecturer, Victoria Katherine Rothschild (b. 1953), a daughter of [[Victor Rothschild, 3rd Baron Rothschild|Sir Nathaniel Rothschild, 3rd Baron Rothschild]];<ref name=Barber/><ref name=Weber/><ref name=VKGNPG>{{cite web|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person.php?LinkID=mp94341|title=Victoria Katherine Gray (née Rothschild)|work=[[National Portrait Gallery (London)|National Portrait Gallery]]|format=[[World Wide Web|Web]]|publisher=npg.org.uk|access-date=6 April 2009|quote=Academic and lecturer; daughter of Sir Nathaniel Rothschild, 3rd Baron Rothschild.}}</ref> in 1997, after his divorce, they married, living together in west London, until his death.<ref name=Young1>{{cite web|author=Josa Young|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/josa-young/the-late-great-simon-gray_b_176306.html|title=The Late Great Simon Gray|format=[[World Wide Web|Web]]|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=25 March 2009|access-date=29 March 2009}}</ref>

In 2004 he was appointed [[Order of the British Empire|Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] for services to drama and literature.<ref name=TOLobit/>

Suffering from both lung cancer and [[prostate cancer]] and related ailments at the time of his death, he died of an [[abdominal aortic aneurysm]], on 7 August 2008, at the age of 71.<ref name=BillingtonSGobit/><ref name=Gardner/><ref name=Turner>{{cite news|author=Janice Turner|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article3801820.ece|title=Simon Gray Has Lung Cancer, But Won't Stop Smoking|work=[[The Times|Times Online]]|format=[[World Wide Web|Web]]|publisher=[[News Corporation (1980–2013)|News Corporation]]|date=24 April 2008|access-date=29 March 2009|quote=There is a burning inevitability, of course, that a habit begun aged 7, pursued tirelessly, heroically even, through past health horrors including [[aneurysm]]s and [[prostate cancer]], peaking at 65 fags a day, would get him in the end.}}</ref>

==Career==
When he was still in his 20s, he began his writing career as a novelist with ''Colmain'', published by [[Faber and Faber]] in 1963.<ref name=BC>{{cite web|url=http://www.contemporarywriters.com/authors/?p=auth5181C8790c9332BF8BiTW2C7EFEA |title=Simon Gray |work=Contemporary Writers |format=[[World Wide Web|Web]] |publisher=[[British Council]] |date=30 August 2007 |access-date=30 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071003035804/http://www.contemporarywriters.com/authors/?p=auth5181C8790c9332BF8BiTW2C7EFEA |archive-date=3 October 2007 }}</ref> His career in drama began when he adapted one of his own short stories, ''[[The Caramel Crisis]]'', for television. He subsequently wrote a number of plays for, amongst others, ''[[The Wednesday Play]]'' and ''[[Play for Today]]'' BBC anthology series, frequently in collaboration with the producer [[Kenith Trodd]].<ref name=Trodd>{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/T/htmlT/troddkenith/troddkenith.htm|title=Trodd, Kenith: British Producer|work=[[Museum of Broadcast Communications]]|format=[[World Wide Web|Web]]|publisher=museum.tv|access-date=29 March 2009}}</ref> Gray wrote 40 plays and screenplays for the stage, television, and film and eight volumes of memoirs based on his diaries.<ref name=BC/>

''[[Wise Child]]'', an adaptation of a TV play deemed too shocking for the small screen, was his first stage play. It starred [[Simon Ward]] and [[Alec Guinness]] and was produced by [[Michael Codron]] at [[Wyndham's Theatre]] in 1967. Subsequently, he wrote original plays for both radio and television and adaptations, including a TV adaptation of ''[[The Rector’s Daughter]]'', by [[F. M. Mayor]], and stage adaptations of ''[[Tartuffe]]'' and ''[[The Idiot (novel)|The Idiot]]''.  His original television screenplays include ''[[Running Late]]'', ''[[After Pilkington]]'', ''[[Unnatural Pursuits]]'', and ''[[A Month in the Country (film)|A Month in the Country]]''.  His 1971 play ''[[Butley (play)|Butley]]'', produced by Codron, began a long creative partnership with [[Harold Pinter]] as director of both the play and the film versions and continued the partnership with the actor [[Alan Bates]] begun with Gray's 1967 television play ''Death of a Teddy Bear''. In all Bates starred in 11 of Gray's works, while Pinter directed 10 separate productions of Gray's works for stage, film, and television, beginning with ''Butley''. The last one was a stage production of ''[[The Old Masters (play)|The Old Masters]]'', starring [[Peter Bowles]] and [[Edward Fox (actor)|Edward Fox]].<ref name=BC/><ref name=Rappaport>{{cite web|author=Karen Rappaport, comp.|url=http://alanbates.com/abarchive/tv/tv.html|title=The Alan Bates Archive: TV|format=[[World Wide Web|Web]]|access-date=29 March 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427082914/http://www.alanbates.com/abarchive/tv/tv.html|archive-date=27 April 2009|df=dmy-all}} (Converted to a memorial site after death of Alan Bates.)</ref><ref name=HPGray>{{cite web|url=http://www.haroldpinter.org/directing.shtml|title=Stage, TV and Film Productions Directed by Harold Pinter|work=HaroldPinter.org|publisher=[[Harold Pinter]]|date=2000–[2008]|format=[[World Wide Web|Web]]|access-date=29 March 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

As with ''[[Butley (play)|Butley]]'' (1971) and ''[[Otherwise Engaged]]'' (1975), whose London productions and films both starred Bates, and ''[[Quartermaine's Terms]]'' (1981), starring Fox, Gray "often returned to the subject of the lives and trials of educated intellectuals."<ref name=BC/>

He wrote many other successful stage plays, including ''[[The Common Pursuit]]'', ''[[The Late Middle Classes]]'', ''[[Hidden Laughter]]'', ''[[Japes (stage play)|Japes]]'', ''[[Close of Play]]'', ''[[The Rear Column]]'', and ''[[Little Nell (Simon Gray play)|Little Nell]]'', several of which he directed himself.

In 1984, at the suggestion of [[Robert McCrum]], [[Faber and Faber|Faber]] editor-in-chief at that time, he kept a diary of the London premiere of ''[[The Common Pursuit]]'' (directed by Pinter) at the [[Lyric Hammersmith]]), resulting in the first of his 8 volumes of theatre-related and personal memoirs, ''An Unnatural Pursuit'' ([[Faber and Faber|Faber]] 1985), and culminating in the critically acclaimed trilogy entitled ''The Smoking Diaries'' (Granta, 2004–2008).<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Ian Jack]] |title=In Memory of Simon Gray |url=http://www.granta.com/Magazine/Granta-103/In-Memory-of-Simon-Gray |publisher=[[Granta]] 103 (Autumn 2008) |access-date=5 February 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703041636/http://www.granta.com/Magazine/Granta-103/In-Memory-of-Simon-Gray |archive-date=3 July 2009 }}</ref>

Gray's play about [[George Blake]], ''[[Cell Mates (play)|Cell Mates]]'' (1995), starring [[Rik Mayall]], [[Stephen Fry]] and [[Simon Ward]], attracted media attention when [[Stephen Fry]] suffered a nervous breakdown and abruptly "fled to [[Bruges]]" after the third West End performance, thus leaving the show without its lead actor.<ref name=Gould/> Gray subsequently wrote his theatrical memoir ''Fat Chance'', providing a scathingly hilarious account of the episode.<ref name=FatChance>{{cite web|url=http://www.complete-review.com/reviews/grays/fchance.htm|title=Fat Chance|work=The Complete Review|format=[[World Wide Web|Web]]|publisher=The Complete Review, 2001–2006|access-date=29 March 2009}}</ref>

In August 2008, shortly before his death, he attracted further press attention with his criticism of the [[Royal National Theatre]]'s "cowardice" in dealing with the subject of radical [[Islamism|Islam]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Henry Deedes|title=Pandora: Gray Goes On the Attack over Hytner's 'easy liberalism'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/columnists/pandora/pandora-gray-goes-onthe-attackover-hytners-easyliberalism-880322.html|work=[[The Independent|Independent]]|format=[[World Wide Web|Web]]|publisher=[[Independent News & Media]]|date=30 July 2008|access-date=29 March 2009}}{{dead link|date=August 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

==Posthumous tributes and related developments==
Gray's final volume of diaries, ''Coda'', "so named because it rounds off the trilogy of 'Smoking Diaries' (The Smoking Diaries, The Year of the Jouncer and The Last Cigarette) … a meditation on death, or rather dying, an account of living on borrowed time," was published posthumously by Faber and Faber and ''[[Granta]]'' in November 2008.<ref name=Sale>{{cite web|author=Jonathan Sale|title=Coda, by Simon Gray: The Moving and Comic Final Memoir of a Writer at the Fag-end of His Life|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/coda-by-simon-gray-1034910.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201033847/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/coda-by-simon-gray-1034910.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=1 February 2012|work=[[The Independent]]|format=[[World Wide Web|Web]]|publisher=[[Independent News & Media]]|date=26 November 2008|access-date=29 March 2009}}</ref><ref name=GouldCoda>{{cite web|author=Tony Gould |url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/2577366/a-rich-harvest.thtml |title=Book Reviews: A Rich Harvest: CODA, Simon Gray |work=The Spectator Book Club |format=[[World Wide Web|Web]] |publisher=[[The Spectator]] ([[Press Holdings]]) |date=5 November 2008 |access-date=1 April 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605080558/http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/2577366/a-rich-harvest.thtml |archive-date=5 June 2011 }}</ref> From 8 to 12 December 2008, in five 15-minute episodes, actor [[Toby Stephens]] read from this "candid and darkly comic account of coming to terms with terminal cancer" for [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Book of the Week]]''.<ref name=BBCRadio4Coda>{{cite web|author=Simon Gray|url=http://search.bbc.co.uk/search?Search=Search&tab=tvradio&scope=all&uri=%2Fradio4%2Farts%2Fbook_week.shtml&q=Simon%20Gray%20Coda|title=Coda|work=Book of the Week|publisher=[[BBC Radio 4]]|date=8–12 Dec 2008|access-date=3 April 2009}}</ref>
