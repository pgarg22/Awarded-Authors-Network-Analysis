'''Edward Ravenscroft''' (c. 1654–1707) was an [[English people|English]] [[dramatist]] who belonged to an ancient [[Flintshire]] family.

He was entered at the [[Middle Temple]], but devoted his attention mainly to literature.<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Ravenscroft, Edward |volume=22|pages=927–930}}</ref> Among his pieces are: 
* ''[[The Citizen Turned Gentleman]]'' ([[Dorset Garden]], 1671, pr. 1675)
*''[[The Careless Lovers]]'' (Dorset Garden, 1673, pr. 1673), a comedy of intrigue
* ''[[The Wrangling Lovers]]'' (Dorset Garden, 1676)
*''[[Scaramouch a Philosopher]]'', ''[[Harlequin a Schoolboy]]'', ''[[Bravo a Merchant and Magician]]'' ([[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Theatre Royal]], 1677)
* ''[[King Edgar and Alfreda]]'' (Theatre Royal, 1677)
*''[[English Lawyer]]'' (Theatre Royal, 1678), an adaptation of [[Ignoramus (play)|George Ruggle]]'s [[Latin]] play of ''Ignoramus'', presented before [[James I of England|James I]] at [[Cambridge]] in March 1615;
*''[[The London Cuckolds]]'' (Dorset Garden, 1681, pr. 1683), which became a stock piece, but was struck out of the repertory by [[David Garrick]] in 1751
* ''[[Dame Dobson]]'' (1683)
*''[[Titus Andronicus, or, The rape of Lavinia]]'' acted at the Theatre Royall: a tragedy, alter'd from Mr. Shakespears works / by Mr. Edw. Ravens croft. 1686.
* ''[[The Canterbury Guests]]'' (Drury Lane, 1694)
*''[[The Italian Husband]]'' ([[Lincoln's Inn Fields]], 1697).
He wrote a total of twelve plays, in which he adapted freely from [[Molière]], [[William Shakespeare]] and others. He ventured to decry the heroic drama, and [[John Dryden]] retaliated by satirizing his ''Mamamouchi'', a foolish adaptation from Molière's ''[[Bourgeois Gentilhomme]]'' and ''[[Monsieur de Pourceaugnac]]'', in the prologue to the ''[[Assignation]]'' (Dryden, Works, ed. Scott, iv. 345 seq.)<ref name="EB1911"/>

Ravenscroft was the first critic to posit that Shakespeare's play [[Titus Andronicus]] was not originally written by him. In 1686 he  revived the play at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane Theatre]], which he entitled "Titus Andronicus, or the rape of Lavinia",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A59525.0001.001?view=toc|title = Titus Andronicus, or, the rape of Lavinia acted at the Theatre Royall : A tragedy, alter'd from Mr. Shakespears works / By Mr. Edw. Ravenscroft.}}</ref> he wrote in the address "to the Reader", "I have been told by some anciently conversant with the Stage, that it was not Originally his (Shakespeare's), but brought by a private Author to be Acted and he only gave some Master-touches to one or two of the Principal Parts or Characters; this I am apt to believe, because 'tis the most incorrect and indigested piece in all his Works, It seems rather a heap of Rubbish then a Structure." 
This position is now known as the "Ravenscroft tradition" within literary circles.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ARpRAAAAcAAJ&q=Ravenscroft+tradition&pg=PA47 |title = The Pictorial Edition of the Works of Shakspere: Doubtful plays &c|last1 = Shakespeare|first1 = William|year = 1839}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z50UAAAAQAAJ&q=Ravenscroft+tradition&pg=PP12 |title = Titus Andronicus Partly by William Shakspere: The First Quarto, 1600|last1 = Shakespeare|first1 = William|year = 1600}}</ref>
