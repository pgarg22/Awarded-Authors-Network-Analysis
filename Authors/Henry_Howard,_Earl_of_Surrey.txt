'''Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey'''  (1516/1517 – 19 January 1547), [[Order of the Garter|KG]], was an English nobleman, politician and poet. He was one of the founders of English [[Renaissance]] poetry and was the last known person executed at the instance of [[King Henry VIII]]. He was a first cousin of both Queen [[Anne Boleyn]] and Queen [[Catherine Howard]], second and fifth wives of King Henry VIII. His name is usually associated in literature with that of the poet [[Thomas Wyatt (poet)|Sir Thomas Wyatt]]. He was the son of [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|Thomas Howard]], Earl of Surrey, and when his father became Duke of Norfolk (1524) the son adopted the courtesy title of Earl of Surrey. Owing largely to the powerful position of his father, Howard took a prominent part in the court life of the time, and served as  a soldier both in France and Scotland. He was a man of reckless temper, which involved him in many quarrels, and finally brought upon him the wrath of the ageing and embittered Henry VIII. He was arrested, tried for treason and  beheaded on Tower Hill.

==Origins==
He was born in [[Hunsdon]], [[Hertfordshire]],<ref name=tpf>[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poets/detail/henry-howard "Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey", Poetry Foundation]</ref> the eldest son of [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk]], by his second wife [[Elizabeth Stafford, Duchess of Norfolk|Elizabeth Stafford]], a daughter of [[Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham]]. He was thus descended from King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] on his father's side and from King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] on his mother's side.

==Career==
He was brought-up at [[Windsor Castle]] with [[Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Richmond and Somerset]], the illegitimate son of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].  He became a close friend, and later a brother-in-law, of Fitzroy following the marriage of his sister to him.<ref name=Norton>The Norton Anthology of English Literature: Sixteenth/Early Seventeenth Century, Volume B, 2012, pg. 661</ref> Like his father and grandfather, he was a soldier, serving in Henry VIII's French wars as Lieutenant General of the King on Sea and Land.

He was repeatedly imprisoned for rash behaviour, on one occasion for striking a courtier; on another for wandering through the streets of London breaking the windows of houses whose occupants were asleep.<ref name=Norton/> He assumed the [[courtesy title]]  [[Earl of Surrey]] in 1524 when his grandfather died and his father became [[Duke of Norfolk]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1532 he accompanied  [[Anne Boleyn]] (his first cousin), King Henry VIII, and the Duke of Richmond to France, staying there for more than a year as a member of the entourage of King [[Francis I of France]]. 1536 was a notable year for Howard:  his first son was born, namely  [[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk|Thomas Howard]] (later 4th Duke of Norfolk), Anne Boleyn was executed on charges of [[adultery]] and treason, and the Duke of Richmond died at the age of 17 and was buried at [[Thetford Abbey]], one of the Howard seats. In 1536 Howard also served with his father in the suppression of the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]], a rebellion against the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Marriage and progeny==
[[File:Hans Holbein the Younger - Frances, Countess of Surrey RL 12214.jpg|thumb|Frances de Vere, by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], c.&nbsp;1535]]
He married [[Frances de Vere, Countess of Surrey|Frances de Vere]], a daughter of [[John de Vere, 15th Earl of Oxford]],<ref name=tpf/> (by his wife [[Elizabeth de Vere, Countess of Oxford|Elizabeth Trussell]]) by whom he had two sons and three daughters:
* [[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk]] (10 March 1536 – 2 June 1572), who married three times: (1) [[Mary FitzAlan]] (2) [[Margaret Audley, Duchess of Norfolk|Margaret Audley]] (3) [[Elizabeth Leyburne]].
* [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton]], who died unmarried.
* [[Jane Howard, Countess of Westmorland|Jane Howard]], who married [[Charles Neville, 6th Earl of Westmorland]].
* Margaret Howard, who married [[Henry Scrope, 9th Baron Scrope of Bolton]].
* Katherine Howard, who married [[Henry Berkeley, 7th Baron Berkeley]].

==Downfall==
[[File:Howard, Earle of Surrey, for which he was attainted.svg|left|thumb|upright|The arms for which Howard was attainted (Edward the Confessor's arms are in the fifth quarter with a label of three points plain Argent).<ref>Jessie Childs, ''Henry VIII's Last Victim: The Life and Times of Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey'' (New York: St. Martin's Press, 2007), plate 35.</ref>]]
The Howards had little regard for the "new men" who had risen to power at court, such as [[Thomas Cromwell]] and the [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Seymours]]. Howard was less circumspect than his father in concealing his disdain. The Howards had many enemies at court.<ref>Jessie Childs, ''Henry VIII's Last Victim: The Life and Times of Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey'' (New York: St. Martin’s Press, 2007).</ref> Howard himself branded Cromwell a 'foul churl' and [[William Paget, 1st Baron Paget|William Paget]] a 'mean creature' as well as arguing that 'These new erected men would by their wills leave no nobleman on life!'<ref>Jessie Childs, ''Henry VIII's Last Victim: The Life and Times of Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey'' (New York: St. Martin’s Press, 2007), p. 1.</ref>

Henry VIII, consumed by [[paranoia]] and increasing illness, became convinced that Howard had planned to usurp the crown from his son the future King [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]. Howard suggested that his sister [[Mary FitzRoy, Duchess of Richmond and Somerset]] (widow of Henry's illegitimate son Henry Fitzroy) should seduce the aged King, her father-in-law, and become his mistress, to "wield as much influence on him as [[Anne de Pisseleu d'Heilly|Madame d'Etampes]] doth about the [[Francis I of France|French King]]". The Duchess, outraged, said she would "cut her own throat" rather than "consent to such villainy".<ref>{{cite book|title=The Mistresses of Henry VIII |first=Kelly| last=Hart |edition=First |date=June 1, 2009 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/mistressesofhenr0000hart/page/194 194]–197 |publisher=The History Press |isbn=978-0-7524-4835-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/mistressesofhenr0000hart|url-access=registration }}</ref> She and her brother fell out, and she later laid testimony against Howard that helped lead to his trial and execution for treason. The matter came to a head when Howard [[Quartering (heraldry)|quartered]] the [[attributed arms]] of King [[Edward the Confessor]]. [[John Barlow (priest)|John Barlow]] had once called Howard "the most foolish proud boy that is in England" and, although the arms of Howard's ancestor [[Thomas Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk]], show that he was entitled to bear Edward the Confessor's arms, doing so was an act of pride.<ref>''The Heraldic Charge Against the Earl of Surrey'', Peter R. Moore, ''English Historical Review'', Volume CXVI, pages 557 to 583, (2001).</ref> In consequence, the King ordered Howard's imprisonment and that of his father, sentencing them to death on 13 January 1547. Howard was [[Decapitation|beheaded]] on 19 January 1547 on a charge of treasonably quartering the royal arms. His father escaped execution as the king died the day before that appointed for the beheading, but he remained imprisoned. Howard's son [[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk|Thomas Howard]], became heir to the Dukedom of Norfolk in place of his father, which title he inherited on the 3rd Duke's death in 1554.

==Burial==
[[File:Henry Howard Earl of Surrey.jpg|thumb|right|Howard's [[chest tomb]] in [[St Michael the Archangel, Framlingham|Framlingham Church]], Suffolk, displaying the arms of Howard and de Vere]]
He was buried in [[St Michael the Archangel, Framlingham|Framlingham Church]] in Suffolk, where survives his spectacular painted alabaster tomb.

==Literary activity and legacy==
He and his friend [[Thomas Wyatt (poet)|Sir Thomas Wyatt]] were the first English poets to write in the [[sonnet]] form that [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] later used, and Howard was the first English poet to publish [[blank verse]] (unrhymed [[iambic pentameter]]) in his translation of the second and fourth books of [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]''. 
Together, Wyatt and Howard, due to their excellent translations of [[Petrarch]]'s sonnets, are known as "Fathers of the English Sonnet". While Wyatt introduced the sonnet into English, it was Howard who gave them the rhyming meter and the division into quatrains that now characterises the sonnets variously named English, Elizabethan, or [[Sonnet#English (Shakespearean) sonnet|Shakespearean sonnets]].<ref>[http://shakespeare-navigators.com/romeo/Sonnet.html The Shakespearean Sonnet]</ref><ref>[http://www.sonnets.org/early.htm Sonnets]</ref>
