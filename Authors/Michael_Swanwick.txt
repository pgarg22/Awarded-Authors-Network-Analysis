'''Michael Swanwick''' is an American [[list of fantasy authors|fantasy]] and [[list of science fiction authors|science fiction author]] who began publishing in the early 1980s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.locusmag.com/2004/Issues/06Swanwick.html |title=Locus Online: Michael Swanwick interview excerpts |publisher=Locus Magazine |date=2004-05-27 |access-date=2010-03-31}}</ref>

==Writing career==
Swanwick's fiction writing began with short stories, starting in 1980 when he published "Ginungagap" in ''[[TriQuarterly]]'' and "The Feast of St. Janis" in ''New Dimensions 11''.  Both stories were nominees for the [[Nebula Award for Best Short Story]] in 1981.<ref>[http://www.crescentblues.com/6_6issue/int_swanwick.shtml The Periodic Prime of Michael Swanwick] (interview with Michael Swanwick) accessed 3 January 2014</ref>
His first novel was ''[[In the Drift]]'' (an [[Ace Science Fiction Specials|Ace Special]], 1985), a look at the results of a more catastrophic [[Three Mile Island]] incident, which expands on his earlier short story "Mummer's Kiss".  This was followed in 1987 by ''[[Vacuum Flowers]]'', an adventurous tour of an inhabited Solar System, where the people of Earth have been subsumed by a cybernetic mass-mind. Some characters’ bodies contain multiple personalities, which can be recorded and edited (or damaged) as if they were [[wetware (brain)|wetware]].

In the 1990s, Swanwick moved towards the intersection between [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]]. ''[[Stations of the Tide]]'' (1991) is the story of a bureaucrat's pursuit of a magician on a world soon to be altered by its 50-year tide swell; it is set far in the future, blurring the line between magic and technology. ''[[The Iron Dragon's Daughter]]'' (1993) is a fantasy set in a [[Fairyland]] based on modern America, with elves wearing Armani suits and dragons serving as jet fighters. The main character, a [[changeling]] stolen from the real world, struggles to survive a factory, a high school, and a university, all the while being manipulated by a dragon. In ''[[Jack Faust (novel)|Jack Faust]]'' (1997), a retelling of the [[Faust]] legend, the scholar does not gain magical power but modern scientific knowledge and, with which he begins the [[Industrial Revolution]] centuries early.

In the 2000s, Swanwick wrote several series of [[flash fiction]]s, beginning with ''[[Puck Aleshire's Abecedary]]'', a collection of 26 stories, each titled for a different letter of the alphabet. Other series included ''[[The Periodic Table of Science Fiction]]'', 118 stories each themed about a different chemical element. These were originally published in [[Sci Fiction]]. Later, ''The Infinite Matrix'' published ''The Sleep of Reason'', in which each story was based on one of [[Goya]]’s ''[[Los caprichos|caprichos]]''. In this period, he won several awards for short fiction; between 1999 and 2003, he had nine stories shortlisted for the [[Hugo Award for Best Short Story]], and won in 1999, 2000, and 2002.<ref>{{cite web |title=Conversations with a Dark God: An Interview With Michael Swanwick |url=http://www.sfsite.com/07b/ms132.htm |website=The SF Site |access-date=5 November 2021}}</ref>

He also continued to write novels. ''[[Bones of the Earth]]'' (2002) is a [[time travel|time-travel]] story involving [[dinosaur]]s. ''[[The Dragons of Babel]]'' (2008) is set in the same world as ''The Iron Dragon's Daughter'', although the setting and characters are different; ''The Iron Dragon’s Mother'' (2019) was a third volume in the series. He has written two novels featuring the [[posthuman]] rogues Darger and Surplus, who had already appeared in short stories: ''Dancing with Bears'' (2011) concerns their adventures in post-Utopian Russia, and in “Chasing the Phoenix” (2015) they travel to China. After Gardner Dozois’s death, Swanwick completed his unfinished novel ''City Under the Stars''.

His short fiction has been collected in ''[[Gravity's Angels]]'' (1991), ''[[Moon Dogs]]'' (2000), ''[[Tales of Old Earth]]'' (2000), ''[[Cigar-Box Faust and Other Miniatures]]'' (2003), ''[[The Dog Said Bow-Wow]]'' (2007), and ''[[The Best of Michael Swanwick]]'' (2008). A novella, ''Griffin's Egg'', was published in book form in 1991 and is also collected in ''Moon Dogs''. He has collaborated with other authors on several short works, including [[Gardner Dozois]] ("Ancestral Voices", "City of God", "Snow Job") and [[William Gibson]] ("[[Dogfight (short story)|Dogfight]]").

''Stations of the Tide'' won the [[Nebula Award|Nebula]] for [[Nebula Award for Best Novel|best novel]] in 1991, and several of his shorter works have won awards as well: the Theodore Sturgeon Memorial Award for "The Edge of the World" in 1989, the World Fantasy Award for "[[Radio Waves (novella)|Radio Waves]]" in 1996,<ref>{{cite web|author=World Fantasy Convention |year=2010 |title=Award Winners and Nominees |url=http://www.worldfantasy.org/awards/awardslist.html/ |access-date=4 Feb 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201074405/http://worldfantasy.org/awards/awardslist.html |archive-date=2010-12-01 }}</ref> and [[Hugo Award|Hugos]] for "[[The Very Pulse of the Machine]]" in 1999, "[[Scherzo with Tyrannosaur]]" in 2000, "[[The Dog Said Bow-Wow]]" in 2002, "[[Slow Life (novelette)|Slow Life]]" in 2003, and "Legions in Time" in 2004.

===Nonfiction writing===
Swanwick has written about the field as well. He published two long essays on the state of the science fiction ([[The User's Guide to the Postmoderns]], 1986) and fantasy ("In the Tradition...", 1994), the former of which was controversial for its categorization of new SF writers into "cyberpunk" and "literary humanist" camps. Both essays were collected together in ''[[The Postmodern Archipelago]]'' 1997. A book-length interview with Gardner Dozois, ''[[Being Gardner Dozois]]'', was published in 2001. He is a prolific contributor to the [[New York Review of Science Fiction]]. Swanwick wrote a monograph on [[James Branch Cabell]], "What Can Be Saved From the Wreckage?" which was published in 2007, and a short [[biography in literature|literary biography]] of [[Hope Mirrlees]], ''Hope-in-the-Mist'', which was published in 2009.

=== Television and Film ===
Swanwick's short story "Ice Age" from ''Tales of Old Earth'' was adapted for an episode of the first season of the Netflix series ''[[Love, Death & Robots|Love, Death + Robots]]'' (2019).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.netflix.com/title/80174608|title=Love, Death & Robots {{!}} Netflix Official Site|website=www.netflix.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-07}}</ref>[[File:Michael Swanwick 2007.jpg|thumb|At the [[Avram Davidson]] tribute, NYC, 2007]]

==Personal Life==
Swanwick thanks his wife, Marianne C. Porter, in all his books, referring to her as “the M. C. Porter Endowment for the Arts”.<ref>{{cite web |title=Don't Try to Make a Living Writing Short Stories |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/09/geeks-guide-michael-swanwick/ |website=wired.com |access-date=5 November 2021}}</ref>

He was a friend of [[Gardner Dozois]] and Susan Caspar for many years. From this friendship grew ''Being Gardner Dozois'' and several collaborations, including the novel ''City Under the Stars''.<ref>{{cite web |title=The City Under the Stars - Gardner Dozois' Last Book |url=https://floggingbabel.blogspot.com/2019/07/the-city-under-stars-gardner-dozois.html |website=Flogging Babel |access-date=5 November 2021}}</ref>
