'''Edwin Abbott Abbott''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FBA}} (20 December 1838&nbsp;– 12 October 1926)<ref>Thorne and Collocott 1984, p. 2.</ref> was an English [[schoolmaster]], [[theology|theologian]], and [[Anglican priest]], best known as the author of the [[novella]] ''[[Flatland]]'' (1884).

== Biography ==
Edwin Abbott Abbott was the eldest son of [[Edwin Abbott (educator)|Edwin Abbott]] (1808&ndash;1882), headmaster of the Philological School, [[Marylebone]], and his wife, Jane Abbott (1806&ndash;1882). His parents were first cousins.

He was born in London and educated at the [[City of London School]] and at [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]],<ref>{{cite book | last=[[Richard Malden|Malden]] | first=Richard (ed) | title= Crockford's Clerical Directory for 1920 (51st edn) | location= London | publisher= The Field Press| pages=1 | year=1920 }}</ref> where he took the highest honours of his class in [[classics]], [[mathematics]] and [[theology]], and became a [[fellow]] of his college. In particular, he was 1st [[Smith's Prize|Smith's prizeman]] in 1861.<ref>{{acad|id=ABT857EA|name=Abbott, Edwin Abbott}}</ref>{{efn|group=notes|name=venn-error|This seems to be an error by Venn: Colby's preface to Abbott's ''Flatland'' states that Abbott was 7th ''Senior Optime'', ''Senior Classic'' and 1st Chancellor's Medallist in 1861; William Steadman Aldis was 1st Smith's Prizeman in 1861.}} In 1862 he took orders. After holding masterships at [[King Edward's School, Birmingham]], he succeeded [[George Ferris Whidborne Mortimer|G. F. Mortimer]] as headmaster of the [[City of London School]] in 1865, at the early age of 26. There, he oversaw the education of future Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]]. Abbott was [[Hulsean Lectures|Hulsean lecturer]] in 1876.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Abbott, Edwin Abbott|volume=1|page=26}}</ref>

He retired in 1889, and devoted himself to literary and theological pursuits. Abbott's liberal inclinations in theology were prominent both in his educational views and in his books. His ''[[Shakespearian Grammar]]'' (1870) is a permanent contribution to English [[philology]]. In 1885, he published a life of [[Francis Bacon (philosopher)|Francis Bacon]]. His theological writings include three anonymously published religious romances – ''[[Philochristus]]'' (1878), where he tried to raise interest in [[Gospel]]s reading, ''[[Onesimus (book)|Onesimus]]'' (1882), and ''[[Silanus the Christian]]'' (1908).<ref name=EB1911/>

More weighty contributions are the anonymous theological discussion ''[[s:The Kernel and the Husk|The Kernel and the Husk]]'' (1886), ''Philomythus'' (1891), his book ''The Anglican Career of [[John Henry Newman|Cardinal Newman]]'' (1892), and his article "The Gospels" in the ninth edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', embodying a critical view which caused considerable stir in the English theological world. He also wrote ''St Thomas of Canterbury, his Death and Miracles'' (1898), ''Johannine Vocabulary'' (1905), ''Johannine Grammar'' (1906).<ref name=EB1911/>

Abbott also wrote educational text books, one being "Via Latina: A First Latin Book" which was published in 1880 and distributed around the world within the education system.

{{main article|Flatland}}
Abbott's best-known work is his 1884 novella ''Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions'' which describes a two-dimensional world and explores the nature of dimensions. It has often been categorized as [[science fiction]] although it could more precisely be called "mathematical fiction".

With the advent of modern science fiction from the 1950s to the present day, ''Flatland'' has seen a revival in popularity,<ref>Clute and Nicholls 1995, p. 1.</ref> especially among [[science fiction]] and [[cyberpunk]] fans.<ref name="Harper 2010">Harper 2010</ref> Many works have been inspired by the novella, including novel sequels and short films.<ref name="Harper 2010"/>
