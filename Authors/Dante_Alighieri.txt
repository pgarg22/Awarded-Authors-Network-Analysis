Dante is known for establishing the use of the [[vernacular]] in literature at a time when most poetry was written in [[Latin]], which was accessible only to the most educated readers. His ''[[De vulgari eloquentia]]'' (''On Eloquence in the Vernacular'') was one of the first scholarly defenses of the vernacular. His use of the [[Tuscan dialect]] for works such as ''[[La Vita Nuova|The New Life]]'' (1295) and ''Divine Comedy'' helped establish the modern-day standardized Italian language. His work set a precedent that important Italian writers such as [[Petrarch]] and [[Boccaccio]] would later follow.

Dante was instrumental in establishing the literature of Italy. His depictions of [[Hell]], [[Purgatory]] and [[Heaven]] provided inspiration for the larger body of [[Western art]] and literature.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haller |first=Elizabeth K. |editor-first=Lister M. |editor-last=Matheson |title=Icons of the Middle Ages: Rulers, Writers, Rebels, and Saints |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rETxD8KcnUIC&pg=PA244 |volume=1 |publisher=Greenwood |location=Santa Barbara, CA |date=2012 |page=244 |chapter=Dante Alighieri |isbn=978-0-313-34080-2}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Human accomplishment: the pursuit of excellence in the arts and sciences, 800 B.C. to 1950|last=Murray |first=Charles A.|date=2003|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-019247-1|edition=1st|location=New York|oclc=52047270|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/humanaccomplishm00murr}}</ref> He is cited as an influence on such English writers as [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], [[John Milton]] and [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]], among many others.

He is described as the "father" of the Italian language,<ref>{{cite book|title =The Cambridge Companion to Dante's 'Commedia'|editor1-first =Zygmunt G.|editor1-last =Barański|editor2-first =Simon|editor2-last =Gilson|publisher =Cambridge University Press|date =2018|page =108|isbn =9781108421294}}</ref> and in Italy he is often referred to as ''{{lang|it|il Sommo Poeta}}'' ("the Supreme Poet"). Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio are also called the {{lang|it|tre corone}} ("three crowns") of Italian literature.

==Early life==
Dante was born in [[Florence]], [[Republic of Florence]], in what is now Italy. The exact date of his birth is unknown, although it is generally believed to be around 1265. This can be deduced from [[Autobiographical|autobiographic]] [[allusion]]s in the ''[[Divine Comedy]].'' Its first section, the ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]],'' begins, ''"Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita"'' ("Midway upon the journey of our life"), implying that Dante was around 35 years old, since the average lifespan according to the Bible (Psalm 89:10<!-- do not change to Ps. 90; in the Vulgate, as specified, the chapter is 89 -->, Vulgate) is 70 years; and since his imaginary travel to the netherworld took place in 1300, he was most probably born around 1265. Some verses of the ''Paradiso'' section of the ''Divine Comedy'' also provide a possible clue that he was born under the sign of [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]]: "As I revolved with the eternal twins, I saw revealed, from hills to river outlets, the threshing-floor that makes us so ferocious" (XXII &nbsp;151–154). In 1265, the sun was in Gemini between approximately 11 May and 11 June ([[Julian calendar]]).<ref>His birth date is listed as "probably in the end of May" by Robert Hollander in "Dante" in ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]],'' volume &nbsp;4. According to [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], the poet said he was born in May. See "Alighieri, Dante" in the ''Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani.''</ref>

[[File:Dante-alighieri.jpg|thumb|''Dante Alighieri'', attributed to [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]], in the chapel of the [[Bargello]] palace in Florence. This oldest picture of Dante was painted just prior to his exile and has since been extensively restored.]]
[[File:Dante alighieri, Palazzo dei Giudici.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Portrait of Dante, from a fresco in the Palazzo dei Giudici, Florence]]

Dante claimed that his family descended from the ancient Romans (''Inferno'', XV, 76), but the earliest relative he could mention by name was [[Cacciaguida]] degli Elisei (''Paradiso'', XV, 135), born no earlier than about 1100. Dante's father, [[Alighiero di Bellincione]],<ref name=Trecc/> was a White [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph]] who suffered no reprisals after the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Ghibellines]] won the [[Battle of Montaperti]] in the middle of the 13th&nbsp;century. This suggests that Alighiero or his family may have enjoyed some protective prestige and status, although some suggest that the politically inactive Alighiero was of such low standing that he was not considered worth exiling.<ref>{{cite book |last=Santagata |first=Marco |date=2012 |title=Dante: Il romanzo della sua vita |location=Milan |publisher=Mondadori |page=21 |isbn=978-88-04-62026-6 }}</ref>

Dante's family was loyal to the Guelphs, a political alliance that supported the [[Papacy]] and that was involved in complex opposition to the Ghibellines, who were backed by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. The poet's mother was Bella, probably a member of the Abati family.<ref name=Trecc/> She died when Dante was not yet ten years old. His father Alighiero soon married again, to Lapa di Chiarissimo Cialuffi. It is uncertain whether he really married her, since widowers were socially limited in such matters, but she definitely bore him two children, Dante's half-brother Francesco and half-sister Tana (Gaetana).<ref name=Trecc>{{cite book|work=Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani|publisher=[[Enciclopedia Italiana]]|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/dante-alighieri_(Dizionario-Biografico)/|title=Alighieri, Dante|first=S.A|last=Chimenz|year=2014|bibcode=2014bea..book...56.|language=it|access-date=7 March 2016}}</ref>

Dante said he first met [[Beatrice Portinari]], daughter of [[Folco Portinari]], at age nine, and claimed to have fallen in love with her "[[Love at first sight|at first sight]]", apparently without even talking with her.<ref>{{cite book |title=Delphi Complete Works of Dante Alighieri |edition= Illustrated |volume=6 |author=Dante Alighieri |publisher= Delphi Classics |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-909496-19-4}}</ref> When he was 12, however, he was promised in marriage to [[Gemma Donati|Gemma di Manetto Donati]], daughter of Manetto Donati, member of the powerful Donati family.<ref name=Trecc/> Contracting marriages for children at such an early age was quite common and involved a formal ceremony, including contracts signed before a [[civil law notary|notary]].<ref name=Trecc/> Dante claimed to have seen Beatrice again frequently after he turned 18, exchanging greetings with her in the streets of Florence, though he never knew her well.<ref name=jmdent/>

Years after his marriage to Gemma, he claims to have met Beatrice again; he wrote several sonnets to Beatrice but never mentioned Gemma in any of his poems. He refers to other Donati relations, notably Forese and Piccarda, in his ''Divine Comedy.'' The exact date of his marriage is not known: the only certain information is that, before his exile in 1301, he had fathered three children with Gemma (Pietro, [[Jacopo Alighieri|Jacopo]] and Antonia).<ref name=Trecc/>

Dante fought with the Guelph cavalry at the [[Battle of Campaldino]] (11 June, 1289).<ref name="Davenport2005">{{cite book|last=Davenport|first=John|title=Dante: Poet, Author, and Proud Florentine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MWWKW15MjqMC&pg=PA53|year=2005|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0415-7|page=53|access-date=7 March 2016}}</ref> This victory brought about a reformation of the [[Republic of Florence|Florentine]] constitution. To take part in public life, one had to enroll in one of the city's many commercial or artisan guilds, so Dante entered the Physicians' and Apothecaries' Guild. In the following years, his name is occasionally recorded as speaking or voting in the various councils of the republic. A substantial portion of minutes from such meetings in the years 1298–1300 was lost, however, so the true extent of Dante's participation in the city's councils is uncertain.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

==Education and poetry==
[[File:DanteFresco.jpg|thumb|upright|Mural of Dante in the [[Uffizi]], Florence, by [[Andrea del Castagno]], c. 1450]]

Not much is known about Dante's education; he presumably studied at home or in a chapter school attached to a church or monastery in Florence. It is known that he studied [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] poetry and that he admired the compositions of the Bolognese poet [[Guido Guinizelli]]—in ''Purgatorio'' XXVI he characterized him as his "father"—at a time when the [[Sicilian School]] (''Scuola poetica Siciliana''), a cultural group from [[Sicily]], was becoming known in Tuscany. He also discovered  the [[Occitan|Provençal]] poetry of the [[troubadours]], such as [[Arnaut Daniel]], and the Latin writers of [[classical antiquity]], including [[Cicero]], [[Ovid]] and especially [[Virgil]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/dante-alighieri |title=Dante Alighieri |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=poets.org |publisher=Academy of American Poets |access-date=20 December 2019 }}</ref>

Dante's interactions with Beatrice set an example of so-called [[courtly love]], a phenomenon developed in French and Provençal poetry of prior centuries. Dante's experience of such love was typical, but his expression of it was unique. It was in the name of this love that Dante left his imprint on the ''[[dolce stil novo]]'' (''sweet new style,'' a term which Dante himself coined), and he would join other contemporary poets and writers in exploring never-before-emphasized aspects of love (''Amore''). Love for Beatrice (as [[Petrarch]] would express for Laura somewhat differently) would be his reason for poetry and for living, together with political passions. In many of his poems, she is depicted as semi-divine, watching over him constantly and providing spiritual instruction, sometimes harshly. When Beatrice died in 1290, Dante sought refuge in Latin literature.<ref>{{cite book |title= Names and Naming in Young Adult Literature |volume=27 |author= Alleen Pace Nilsen, Don L.F.

He next dedicated himself to philosophical studies at religious schools like the Dominican one in [[Santa Maria Novella]]. He took part in the disputes that the two principal [[mendicant order|mendicant]] orders ([[Franciscan]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]) publicly or indirectly held in Florence, the former explaining the doctrines of the mystics and of St. [[Bonaventure]], the latter expounding on the theories of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]].<ref name=jmdent>{{cite book |title= The Paradiso of Dante Alighieri |url= https://archive.org/details/paradisoofdantea00dantrich |author= Dante Alighieri |editor= Philip Henry Wicksteed, Herman Oelsner |edition= fifth |publisher= J.M. Dent and Company |year= 1904 |page= [https://archive.org/details/paradisoofdantea00dantrich/page/129 129]}}</ref>

At 18, Dante met [[Guido Cavalcanti]], [[Lapo Gianni]], [[Cino da Pistoia]] and, soon after, [[Brunetto Latini]]; together they became the leaders of the ''dolce stil novo.'' Brunetto later received special mention in the ''Divine Comedy'' (''Inferno'', XV, 28) for what he had taught Dante: ''Nor speaking less on that account I go With Ser Brunetto, and I ask who are his most known and most eminent companions.''<ref>{{cite book |title= Critical Companion to Dante |author= Jay Ruud |publisher= Infobase Publishing |year= 2008 |isbn= 978-1-4381-0841-4 |page= 138}}</ref> Some fifty poetical commentaries by Dante are known (the so-called ''[[The Rime|Rime]],'' rhymes), others being included in the later ''Vita Nuova'' and ''Convivio.''

==Florence and politics==

[[File:Dante Alighieri Florence Firenze JBU01.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Monument to Dante|Statue of Dante]] in the [[Piazza Santa Croce]] in Florence, [[Enrico Pazzi]], 1865]]
Dante, like most Florentines of his day, was embroiled in the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph–Ghibelline conflict]]. He fought in the [[Battle of Campaldino]] (11 June, 1289), with the Florentine Guelphs against [[Arezzo]] Ghibellines;<ref name="Davenport2005"/><ref name=DASM>{{cite web |title=Guelphs and Ghibellines |url=http://www.dantemass.org/html/guelphs-and-ghibellines.html |publisher=Dante Alighieri Society of Massachusetts |access-date=30 December 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151212042335/http://www.dantemass.org/html/guelphs-and-ghibellines.html |archive-date=12 December 2015 }}</ref> then in 1294 he was among the escorts of [[Charles Martel of Anjou]] (grandson of [[Charles&nbsp;I of Anjou]]) while he was in Florence. To further his political career, he became a pharmacist. He did not intend to practice as one, but a law issued in 1295 required nobles aspiring to public office to be enrolled in one of the Corporazioni delle Arti e dei Mestieri, so Dante obtained admission to the Apothecaries' Guild. This profession was not inappropriate, since at that time books were sold from apothecaries' shops. As a politician, he accomplished little but held various offices over some years in a city rife with political unrest.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

After defeating the Ghibellines, the Guelphs divided into two factions: the White Guelphs (''Guelfi Bianchi'')—Dante's party, led by Vieri dei Cerchi—and the Black Guelphs (''Guelfi Neri''), led by [[Corso Donati]]. Although the split was along family lines at first, ideological differences arose based on opposing views of the papal role in Florentine affairs. The Blacks supported the Pope and the Whites wanted more freedom from Rome. The Whites took power first and expelled the Blacks. In response, [[Pope Boniface VIII]] planned a military occupation of Florence. In 1301, [[Charles of Valois]], brother of King [[Philip IV of France]], was expected to visit Florence because the Pope had appointed him as peacemaker for [[Tuscany]]. But the city's government had treated the Pope's ambassadors badly a few weeks before, seeking independence from papal influence. It was believed that Charles had received other unofficial instructions, so the council sent a delegation that included Dante to Rome to ascertain the Pope's intentions.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

==Exile from Florence==
Pope Boniface quickly dismissed the other delegates and asked Dante alone to remain in Rome. At the same time (1 November, 1301), Charles of Valois entered Florence with the Black Guelphs, who in the next six days destroyed much of the city and killed many of their enemies. A new Black Guelph government was installed, and [[Cante dei Gabrielli]] da [[Gubbio]] was appointed ''[[podestà]]'' of the city. In March 1302, Dante, a White Guelph by affiliation, along with the [[Gherardini family]], was condemned to exile for two years and ordered to pay a large fine.<ref>[[Dino Compagni]], ''Cronica delle cose occorrenti ne' tempi suoi''</ref> Dante was accused of corruption and financial wrongdoing by the Black Guelphs for the time that Dante was serving as city prior (Florence's highest position) for two months in 1300.<ref>Robert Harrison, "Dante on Trial", ''NY Review of Books'', 19 February 2015, pp. 36–37</ref> The poet was still in Rome in 1302, as the Pope, who had backed the Black Guelphs, had "suggested" that Dante stay there. Florence under the Black Guelphs, therefore, considered Dante an absconder.<ref>Harrison, p. 36.</ref> 

Dante did not pay the fine, in part because he believed he was not guilty and in part because all his assets in Florence had been seized by the Black Guelphs. He was condemned to perpetual exile; if he had returned to Florence without paying the fine, he could have been burned at the stake. (In June 2008, nearly seven centuries after his death, the city council of Florence passed a motion rescinding Dante's sentence.)<ref>Malcolm Moore [https://web.archive.org/web/20080622172200/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/2145378/Dante%27s-infernal-crimes-forgiven.html "Dante's infernal crimes forgiven"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 17 June 2008.

[[File:Antonio Cotti - Dante a Verona.jpg|thumbnail|left|''Dante in Verona'', by Antonio Cotti]]

Dante took part in several attempts by the White Guelphs to regain power, but these failed due to treachery. Bitter at the treatment he received from his enemies, he grew disgusted with the infighting and ineffectiveness of his erstwhile allies and vowed to become a party of one. He went to [[Verona, Italy|Verona]] as a guest of [[Bartolomeo I della Scala]], then moved to [[Sarzana]] in Liguria. Later he is supposed to have lived in [[Lucca]] with a woman named Gentucca. She apparently made his stay comfortable (and he later gratefully mentioned her in ''Purgatorio'', XXIV, 37). Some speculative sources claim he visited [[Paris]] between 1308 and 1310, and other sources even less trustworthy say he went to [[Oxford]]: these claims, first made in [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]]'s book on Dante several decades after his death, seem inspired by readers who were impressed with the poet's wide learning and erudition. Evidently, Dante's command of philosophy and his literary interests deepened in exile and when he was no longer busy with the day-to-day business of Florentine domestic politics, and this is evidenced in his prose writings in this period. There is no real evidence that he ever left Italy. Dante's ''Immensa Dei dilectione testante'' to Henry VII of Luxembourg confirms his residence "beneath the springs of Arno, near Tuscany" in March 1311.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

In 1310, Holy Roman Emperor [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]] of [[Luxembourg]] marched into Italy at the head of 5,000 troops. Dante saw in him a new [[Charlemagne]] who would restore the office of the Holy Roman Emperor to its former glory and also retake Florence from the Black Guelphs. He wrote to Henry and several Italian princes, demanding that they destroy the Black Guelphs.<ref>Latham, Charles S.; Carpenter, George R. (1891). ''[https://archive.org/details/translationofdan00dant A Translation of Dante’s Eleven Letters]''. Boston: Houghton, Mifflin. pp. 269–282.</ref> Mixing religion and private concerns in his writings, he invoked the worst anger of God against his city and suggested several particular targets, who were also his personal enemies. It was during this time that he wrote ''[[De Monarchia]]'', proposing a [[universal monarchy]] under Henry VII.<ref>Carroll, John S. (1903). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=uAd8Kp0gmoUC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Exiles of Eternity: An Exposition of Dante's Inferno]''. London: Hodder and Stoughton. pp. xlviii–l.</ref>

At some point during his exile, he conceived of the ''Comedy'', but the date is uncertain. The work is much more assured and on a larger scale than anything he had written in Florence; it is likely he would have undertaken such a work only after he realized his political ambitions, which had been central to him up to his banishment, had been halted for some time, possibly forever. It is also noticeable that Beatrice has returned to his imagination with renewed force and with a wider meaning than in the ''Vita Nuova''; in ''Convivio'' (written c. 1304–07) he had declared that the memory of this youthful romance belonged to the past.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

An early indication that the poem was underway is a notice by Francesco da Barberino, tucked into his ''Documenti d'Amore'' (''Lessons of Love''), probably written in 1314 or early 1315. Francesco notes that Dante followed the ''[[Aeneid]]'' in a poem called "Comedy" and that the setting of this poem (or part of it) was the underworld; i.e., hell.<ref>See [http://www.bookrags.com/tandf/francesco-daccorso-tf/ Bookrags.com] and Tigerstedt, E.N. 1967, ''Dante; Tiden Mannen Verket'' (''Dante; The Age, the Man, the Work''), Bonniers, Stockholm, 1967. {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The brief note gives no incontestable indication that Barberino had seen or read even the ''Inferno'', or that this part had been published at the time, but it indicates composition was well underway and that the sketching of the poem might have begun some years before. (It has been suggested that a knowledge of Dante's work also underlies some of the illuminations in Francesco da Barberino's earlier ''Officiolum'' [c. 1305–08], a manuscript that came to light in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spolia.it/online/en/argomenti/letterature_romanze/filologia/2003/barberino.htm|title=L′''Officiolum'' ritrovato di Francesco da Barberino|author=Fabio M. Bertolo|year= 2003|work=Spolia&nbsp;– Journal of Medieval Studies|access-date=18 August 2012}}</ref>) It is known that the ''Inferno'' had been published by 1317; this is established by quoted lines interspersed in the margins of contemporary dated records from [[Bologna]], but there is no certainty as to whether the three parts of the poem were each published in full or, rather, a few cantos at a time. ''Paradiso'' seems to have been published posthumously.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

[[File:Monument to Dante (Verona).jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Dante Alighieri in Verona]]

In 1312 Henry assaulted Florence and defeated the Black Guelphs, but there is no evidence that Dante was involved. Some say he refused to participate in the attack on his city by a foreigner; others suggest that he had become unpopular with the White Guelphs, too, and that any trace of his passage had carefully been removed. Henry VII died (from a fever) in 1313 and with him any hope for Dante to see Florence again. He returned to Verona, where [[Cangrande I della Scala]] allowed him to live in certain security and, presumably, in a fair degree of prosperity. Cangrande was admitted to Dante's Paradise (''Paradiso'', XVII, 76).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Cangrande della Scala - "Da molte stelle mi vien questa luce" |trans-title=Cangrande della Scala - "This light comes to me from many stars" |author= |work=dantealighieri.tk |date= |access-date=1 February 2021 |url= https://www.dantealighieri.tk/paradiso/i-canti-di-cacciaguida/cangrande-della-scala/ |language=it  }}</ref>

In 1315, Florence was forced by [[Uguccione della Faggiuola]] (the military officer controlling the town) to grant an amnesty to those in exile, including Dante. But for this, Florence required public penance in addition to payment of a high fine. Dante refused, preferring to remain in exile. When Uguccione defeated Florence, Dante's death sentence was commuted to house arrest, on condition that he go to Florence to swear he would never enter the town again. He refused to go, and his death sentence was confirmed and extended to his sons. He still hoped late in life that he might be invited back to Florence on honorable terms.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

Dante's final days were spent in [[Ravenna]], where he had been invited to stay in the city in 1318 by its prince, [[Guido II da Polenta]]. Dante died in Ravenna on 14 September 1321, aged about 56, of [[quartan malaria]] contracted while returning from a diplomatic mission to the [[Republic of Venice]]. He was attended by his three children, and possibly by Gemma Donati, and by friends and admirers he had in the city.{{sfn|Raffa|2020|pp=23–24, 27, 28–30}} He was buried in Ravenna at the Church of San Pier Maggiore (later called [[Basilica of San Francesco, Ravenna|Basilica di San Francesco]]). [[Bernardo Bembo]], [[praetor]] of [[Venice]], erected [[Tomb of Dante|a tomb for him]] in 1483.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theflorentine.net/2017/04/10/dante-ravenna-florence-battle-of-bones/|title=Dante: the battle of the bones|date=10 April 2017|website=The Florentine}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.italymagazine.com/news/dantes-tomb |title=Italy Magazine, Dante's Tomb |website=italymagazine.com }}</ref>

In 1329, [[Bertrand du Pouget]], Cardinal and nephew of [[Pope John XXII]], classified Dante's ''Monarchia'' as heretical and sought to have his bones burned at the stake. [[Ostasio I da Polenta]] and Pino della Tosa, allies of Pouget, interceded to prevent the destruction of Dante's remains.{{sfn|Raffa|2020|p=38}}

Florence eventually came to regret having exiled Dante. The city made repeated requests for the return of his remains. The custodians of the body in Ravenna refused, at one point going so far as to conceal the bones in a false wall of the monastery. Florence built a tomb for Dante in 1829, in the [[Basilica di Santa Croce di Firenze|Basilica of Santa Croce]]. That [[cenotaph|tomb has been empty]] ever since, with Dante's body remaining in Ravenna. The front of his tomb in Florence reads ''Onorate l'altissimo poeta'' — which roughly translates as "Honor the most exalted poet" and is a quote from the fourth canto of the ''Inferno''.

In 1945, the [[Italian Social Republic|fascist government]] discussed bringing Dante’s remains to the [[Valtellina Redoubt]], the Alpine valley in which the regime intended to make its last stand against the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. The case was made that "the greatest symbol of Italianness" should be present at fascism's "heroic" end.{{sfn|Raffa|2020|pp=244-245}}

===Overview===
Most of Dante's literary work was composed after his exile in 1301. ''[[La Vita Nuova]]'' ("The New Life") is the only major work that predates it; it is a collection of lyric poems (sonnets and songs) with commentary in prose, ostensibly intended to be circulated in manuscript form, as was customary for such poems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.danteonline.it/english/opere.asp?idope=5&idlang=UK |title=New Life|publisher=Dante online|access-date=September 2, 2008}}</ref> It also contains, or constructs, the story of his love for [[Beatrice Portinari]], who later served as the ultimate symbol of salvation in the ''Comedy'', a function already indicated in the final pages of the ''Vita Nuova''. The work contains many of Dante's love poems in Tuscan, which was not unprecedented; the vernacular had been regularly used for lyric works before, during all the thirteenth century. However, Dante's commentary on his own work is also in the vernacular—both in the ''Vita Nuova'' and in the ''Convivio''—instead of the Latin that was almost universally used.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

The ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' describes Dante's journey through [[Divine Comedy#Inferno|Hell]] (''Inferno''), [[Divine Comedy#Purgatorio|Purgatory]] (''Purgatorio''), and [[9 spheres of heaven|Paradise]] (''Paradiso''); he is first guided by the Roman poet [[Virgil]] and then by [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]]. Of the books, ''Purgatorio'' is arguably the most lyrical of the three, referring to more contemporary poets and artists than ''Inferno''; ''Paradiso'' is the most heavily theological, and the one in which, many scholars have argued, the ''Divine Comedy'''s most beautiful and mystic passages appear (e.g., when Dante looks into the face of God: "all'alta fantasia qui mancò possa"—"at this high moment, ability failed my capacity to describe," ''Paradiso,'' XXXIII, 142).{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

With its seriousness of purpose, its literary stature and the range—both stylistic and thematic—of its content, the ''Comedy'' soon became a cornerstone in the evolution of Italian as an established literary language. Dante was more aware than most early Italian writers of the variety of Italian dialects and of the need to create a literature and a unified literary language beyond the limits of Latin writing at the time; in that sense, he is a forerunner of the [[Renaissance]], with its effort to create vernacular literature in competition with earlier classical writers. Dante's in-depth knowledge (within the limits of his time) of Roman antiquity, and his evident admiration for some aspects of pagan Rome, also point forward to the 15th century. Ironically, while he was widely honored in the centuries after his death, the ''Comedy'' slipped out of fashion among men of letters: too medieval, too rough and tragic, and not stylistically refined in the respects that the high and late Renaissance came to demand of literature.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

[[File:Dante Luca.jpg|thumb|Dante Alighieri, detail from [[Luca Signorelli]]'s fresco in the Chapel of San Brizio, [[Orvieto Cathedral]]]]

He wrote the ''Comedy'' in a language he called "Italian", in some sense an amalgamated literary language mostly based on the regional dialect of Tuscany, but with some elements of Latin and other regional dialects.<ref name="Britannica">{{Britannica|151164|Dante}}</ref> He deliberately aimed to reach a readership throughout Italy including laymen, clergymen and other poets. By creating a poem of epic structure and philosophic purpose, he established that the Italian language was suitable for the highest sort of expression. In French, Italian is sometimes nicknamed ''la langue de Dante''. Publishing in the vernacular language marked Dante as one of the first in [[Roman Catholic]] Western Europe (among others such as [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]) to break free from standards of publishing in only Latin (the language of [[liturgy]], history and scholarship in general, but often also of lyric poetry). This break set a precedent and allowed more literature to be published for a wider audience, setting the stage for greater levels of literacy in the future. However, unlike Boccaccio, [[John Milton|Milton]] or [[Ludovico Ariosto|Ariosto]], Dante did not really become an author read across Europe until the Romantic era. To the Romantics, Dante, like [[Homer]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], was a prime example of the "original genius" who set his own rules, created persons of overpowering stature and depth, and went far beyond any imitation of the patterns of earlier masters; and who, in turn, could not truly be imitated.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} Throughout the 19th century, Dante's reputation grew and solidified; and by 1865, the 600th anniversary of his birth, he had become established as one of the greatest literary icons of the Western world.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

New readers often wonder how such a serious work may be called a "comedy". [[Comedy#Etymology|In the classical sense]] the word ''comedy'' refers to works that reflect belief in an ordered universe, in which events tend toward not only a happy or amusing ending but one influenced by a Providential will that orders all things to an ultimate good. By this meaning of the word, as Dante himself allegedly wrote in a letter to [[Cangrande I della Scala]], the progression of the pilgrimage from Hell to Paradise is the paradigmatic expression of comedy, since the work begins with the pilgrim's moral confusion and ends with the vision of God.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dantesociety.org/publicationsdante-notes/epistle-cangrande-updated|title=Epistle to Cangrande Updated|website=www.dantesociety.org|access-date=2021-06-09}}</ref>
