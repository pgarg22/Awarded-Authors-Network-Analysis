'''Josiah Bancroft''' is a writer of [[fantasy]], known for his initially self-published debut novel ''Senlin Ascends'' (2013).

==Works==
''Senlin Ascends'' and its sequels, the ''Books of Babel'' series, deal with the adventures of the schoolteacher Thomas Senlin, who is separated from his wife Marya at the foot of the immense Tower of Babel, and spends the rest of the narrative searching for her. The novel was uncommonly successful for a self-published work, due in large part to notice gained during the 2016 [[Self-Published Fantasy Blog-Off|SPFBO]] competition, praise on social media from author [[Mark Lawrence (author)|Mark Lawrence]], and a positive review by Emily May, a popular reviewer on [[Goodreads]]. As a result, it was republished, together with the sequel ''Arm of the Sphinx'', by [[Orbit Books]] in 2018. The third book in the series, ''The Hod King'', came out in 2019. The finale of the series, ''The Fall of Babel'', was published in 2021. Bancroft's inspirations for the story are numerous and include ''[[Invisible Cities]]'' by [[Italo Calvino]], ''[[Midnight's Children]]'' by [[Salman Rushdie]], ''[[The Castle (novel)|The Castle]]'' by [[Franz Kafka]], and ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' by [[Douglas Adams]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/7yxaai/interview_josiah_bancroft_the_books_of_babel/|title=Interview, Josiah Bancroft, The Books of Babel|last=|first=|date=20 February 2018|website=Reddit|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=28 January 2020}}</ref> The Tower of Babel in the books is not intended to be the [[Tower of Babel|tower of biblical fame]]. Bancroft has explained that the setting is "more of an alternate universe than an alternate history. The Tower is not part of our timeline or this reality".<ref name=":0" /> Bancroft took the name Senlin from the 1920 poem "Morning Song of Senlin" by [[Conrad Aiken]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ajcd9d/hello_rfantasy_i_am_josiah_bancroft_author_of_the/|title=Josiah Bancroft AMA on Reddit Fantasy|last=|first=|date=24 January 2019|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=27 January 2020}}</ref> The cover art for the three published books was created by Ian Leino, a childhood friend of Bancroft.

''Senlin Ascends'' was well appreciated by critics. ''[[Publishers Weekly]]''{{'}}s starred review described the "brilliant debut fantasy" as "steampunk and epic, surreal and yet grounded in believable logistics".<ref>{{cite news |title=Fiction Book Review: Senlin Ascends by Josiah Bancroft|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-316-51791-1 |accessdate=23 November 2018 |work=Publishers Weekly |language=en}}</ref> ''[[Tor.com]]'' likewise praised the imaginative setting, and called the novel "incredibly creative in its conception and no less confident in its crafting".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Alexander |first1=Niall |title=Up, Up and Away: Senlin Ascends by Josiah Bancroft |url=https://www.tor.com/2018/01/17/book-reviews-senlin-ascends-by-josiah-bancroft/ |accessdate=23 November 2018 |work=Tor.com |date=17 January 2018}}</ref> [[The Washington Post|''The'' ''Washington Post'']] included it in its five best science fiction and fantasy novels of 2018, describing it as "a classic hero’s quest, elevated by creative world building and memorable characters".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Mason |first1=Everdeen |title=The 5 best science fiction and fantasy novels of 2018 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/the-5-best-science-fiction-and-fantasy-novels-of-2018/2018/11/13/14451af0-cbef-11e8-920f-dd52e1ae4570_story.html |accessdate=23 November 2018 |work=Washington Post |date=13 November 2018 |language=en}}</ref>  However, ''[[Strange Horizons]]'' wrote that "the fact that a woman’s sexuality is the root cause of the conflict (...) and that the woman is immediately removed from the narrative" are indicative of the novel's problems with the portrayal of women.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sutton-Morse |first1=Jonah |title=Senlin Ascends by Josiah Bancroft |url=http://strangehorizons.com/non-fiction/reviews/senlin-ascends-by-josiah-bancroft/ |accessdate=23 November 2018 |work=Strange Horizons |date=27 April 2018}}</ref>

The scope of Senlin's saga and the cast of characters expand in ''Arm of the Sphinx''. ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'''s starred review claimed that the second installment "not only matches but adds to the notable achievements of the first".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-316-51795-9|title=Fiction Book Review: Arm of the Sphinx by Josiah Bancroft|last=|first=|date=|website=Publishers Weekly|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=28 January 2020}}</ref> A review on [[Barnes & Noble]]'s Sci-Fi & Fantasy Blog compared Bancroft to "a master craftsman building a workshop around himself".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.barnesandnoble.com/blog/sci-fi-fantasy/arm-sphinx-continues-surreal-climb-tower-babel/|title=Arm of the Sphinx Continues a Surreal Climb Up the Tower of Babel|last=Hill|first=Nicole|date=13 March 2018|website=B&N Sci-Fi & Fantasy Blog|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=28 January 2020}}</ref>

In the third book, ''The Hod King'', Senlin carries out a mission for the enigmatic Sphinx while he and his friends continue the search for Marya. The [[Los Angeles Times]] praised the book as "an easy, joyful read; the author’s vibrant prose, simply incredible".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/books/la-ca-jc-the-hod-king-josiah-bancroft-review-20190118-story.html|title=In ‘The Hod King,’ a man goes on a mystical quest when his wife vanishes on their steampunkish honeymoon|last=Jones|first=Ant|date=22 January 2019|website=latimes.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=29 January 2020}}</ref>

''The Fall of Babel'', the final book in the series, was originally scheduled for release in 2020, but Bancroft asked his publisher for an extension because, among other reasons, he "suffered some setbacks with the draft, including the deletion of a hundred pages or so."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thebooksofbabel.com/blog-1|title=The State of Book Four|last=Bancroft|first=Josiah|date=3 November 2019|website=The Books of Babel|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=29 January 2020}}</ref>
