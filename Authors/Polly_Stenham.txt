'''Polly Stenham''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|MBE|FRSL}} (born 16 July 1986) is an English [[playwright]] known for her play ''[[That Face]]'', which she wrote when she was 19 years old.

==Background==
Stenham was born and raised in London, the eldest of two daughters of business tycoon and [[Royal College of Art]] chairman [[Cob Stenham|Anthony 'Cob' Stenham]], who raised Stenham and her younger sister after his divorce from their mother. She attributes her love of theatre to her father as he took her to various shows from a young age, including many at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] which would later stage her first play.

Stenham was privately educated at [[Wycombe Abbey]] boarding school for girls, and later at [[Rugby School]]. Before university she spent a [[gap year]] travelling and working for the [[Ambassador Theatre Group]] and the [[Arcola Theatre]], and during this time that she enrolled in the Royal Court Young Writers Programme and wrote her first play. She then enrolled at [[University College London]] where she began studying for a degree in English. At the age of 20 her father died, leaving her and her sister independently wealthy. They inherited her father's Highgate townhouse in [[The Grove, Highgate|The Grove]], which quickly became known as London's celebrity "party palace."<ref>{{citation

The play received praise from some reviewers, with [[Charles Spencer (journalist)|Charles Spencer]] of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' commenting:

<blockquote>This is one of the most astonishing debuts I have seen in more than 30 years of theatre reviewing. Its author, Polly Stenham, a graduate of the Royal Court's Young Writers Programme, is 20 now, just 19 when she wrote a play that sent me reeling into the night... In every respect this is a remarkable and unforgettable piece of theatre.<ref>{{citation
