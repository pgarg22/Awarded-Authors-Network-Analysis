==Biography==
[[File:Stanislaw Jerzy Lec Polish writer.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Portrait published in 1966]]
Son of the Baron Benon de Tusch-Letz and Adela Safrin, he was born on 6 March 1909 in [[Lviv|Lwów]] (then Lemberg, [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], now Lviv) to a Galician-Jewish [[nobilitation|nobilitated]] family.<ref name=szetl>Stanisław Jerzy Lec" (in English) on the Wirtualny Sztetl portal [http://www.sztetl.org.pl/m/en/people/82/ (read online).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924125312/http://www.sztetl.org.pl/m/en/people/82/ |date=2015-09-24 }}</ref><ref name="Miłosz1983-519"/> The family moved to [[Vienna]] at the onset of [[World War I|First World War]], and Lec received his early education there. After the war the family returned to Lviv (then Lwów in the [[Second Polish Republic]])  to continue his schooling at the Lemberg Evangelical School. In 1927 he matriculated at Lwów's [[University of Lviv|Jan Kazimierz University]] in Polish language and law.<ref name="Miłosz1983-519">{{cite book|author=Czesław Miłosz|title=The History of Polish Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R-MkT9vavwIC&pg=PA519|date=1 January 1983|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-04477-7|page=519}}</ref>

His literary debut was in 1929.<ref name=yivo/><ref name=szetl/> Much of his early work was lyric poetry appearing in left-wing and communist magazines.<ref name=yivo/><ref name=szetl/>  He collaborated with the communist “''Dziennik Popularny''" between 1933 and 1936.<ref name=szetl/> In 1935 he co-founded the satirical magazine ''[[Szpilki]]'' (Pins).<ref name=yivo/> A "literary cabaret" he founded in Lwów in collaboration with [[Leon Pasternak]] in 1936 was closed by the authorities after several performances.<ref name=szetl/> Nor did his law-abiding image improve after he took part in the Convention of Culture Workers, a radical congress initiated by the international communist movement [[Popular Front]] in the same year.<ref name=szetl/> Later that year he spent a few months in [[Romania]], afraid that his activism could lead to his arrest in Poland.<ref name=szetl/> He spent the next two years in [[Warsaw]], where he was involved with a number of other left-leaning publications.<ref name=szetl/>

Following the [[German invasion of Poland]] on 1 September 1939, Lec fled Warsaw, returning to his hometown, Lwów.<ref name=szetl/> Lec spent the years 1939{{ndash}}1941 there, while the city along with the rest of Polish [[Kresy|Eastern Borderlands]] was occupied by the [[Soviet Union]] after the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] on 17&nbsp;September 1939.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jacek Trznadel|title=Kolaboranci: Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński i grupa komunistycznych pisarzy we Lwowie, 1939{{ndash}}1941|location=[Komorów]|publisher=Fundacja Pomocy Antyk/Wydawnictwo Antyk|year=1998|page=280|isbn= 8387809012|language=pl}}</ref>  While in the Soviet Union, Lec joined in the literary life under the auspices of [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]] authorities. He contributed to the magazine “New Horizons”. His poems, satires, articles, and translations from Russian were published in ”Krasnoe Znamya” magazine. In 1940 he joined the [[Union of Soviet Writers]] of Ukraine and became a member of the editorial board of “The Literary Almanac” in Lwów. Through this and similar activities he became one of the most prolific pro-Soviet Polish writers, producing numerous works praising the Soviet regime,<ref name=szetl/><ref name="SnyderBrandon2014">{{cite book|author1=Timothy Snyder|author2=Ray Brandon|title=Stalin and Europe: Imitation and Domination, 1928-1953|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fZBtAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA145|date=30 May 2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-994557-3|page=145|quote=Although ost Polish authors... rarely if ever visited the club of the Soviet Writers Inion, socialist authors such as ...

==Works==
Lec's early works were primarily lyrical poetry. In his later years, he became known for aphorisms and [[epigram]]s.<ref name=yivo/> He was influenced by religious (Jewish and Christian) as well as European cultural traditions.<ref name=yivo/> In his works he often modernized ancient messages, while preserving their universality.<ref name=yivo/> His notable poems such as ''Notatnik polowy'' (Field Notebook; 1946), ''Rękopis Jerozolimski'' (The Jerusalem Manuscript; 1950–1952, reedited in 1956 and 1957), and ''Do Kaina i Abla'' (To Cain and Abel; 1961) had a theme of exploring the world through irony, melancholy, and nostalgia.<ref name=yivo/> His later works, usually very short (aphorisms), through techniques such as wordplay, paradox, nonsense, abstract humor, and didacticism convey philosophical thoughts through single phrases and sentences.<ref name=yivo/> Collections of Lec’s aphorisms and epigrams include ''Z tysiąca jednej fraszki'' (From a Thousand and One Trifles; 1959), ''Fraszkobranie ''(Gathering Trifles; 1967); and ''Myśli nieuczesane'' (Unkempt Thoughts; 1957, followed by sequels in 1964 and 1966).<ref name=yivo/>
