'''Publius Vergilius Maro''' ({{IPA-la|ˈpuːbliʊs wɛrˈɡɪliʊs ˈmaroː|classical}}; traditional dates 15 October 70{{snd}}21 September 19 BC),<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Peter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JKBIrIOR4PcC&pg=PA1|title=Reading Virgil: Aeneid I and II|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0521768665|pages=1, 4|language=en|access-date=23 November 2016}}</ref> usually called '''Virgil''' or '''Vergil''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|ɜːr|dʒ|ɪ|l}} {{respell|VUR|jil}}) in English, was an [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] poet of the [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan period]]. He composed three of the most famous poems in [[Latin literature]]: the ''[[Eclogues]]'' (or ''Bucolics''), the ''[[Georgics]]'', and the [[Epic poetry|epic]] ''[[Aeneid]]''. A number of minor poems, collected in the ''[[Appendix Vergiliana]]'', were attributed to him in ancient times, but modern scholars consider his authorship of these poems as dubious.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bunson|first1=Matthew|title=Encyclopedia of the Roman Empire|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1438110271|page=28|url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Encyclopedia_of_the_Roman_Empire/T5tic2VunRoC?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA28|access-date=15 July 2021|language=en|year=2014}}</ref>

Virgil's work has had wide and deep influence on [[Western literature]], most notably [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', in which Virgil appears as the author's guide through [[Hell]] and [[Purgatory]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ruud|first1=Jay|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hqc5tXPUjI0C&pg=PA376|title=Critical Companion to Dante|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2008|isbn=978-1438108414|page=376|language=en|access-date=23 November 2016}}</ref>

Virgil has been traditionally ranked as one of Rome's greatest poets. His ''Aeneid'' is also considered a [[national epic]] of ancient [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], a title held since composition.

==Life and works==

===Birth and biographical tradition===
Virgil's biographical tradition is thought to depend on a lost biography by the Roman poet [[Lucius Varius Rufus|Varius]]. This biography was incorporated into an account by the historian [[Suetonius]], as well as the later commentaries of [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]] and [[Aelius Donatus|Donatus]] (the two great commentators on Virgil's poetry). Although the commentaries record much factual information about Virgil, some of their evidence can be shown to rely on allegorizing and on inferences drawn from his poetry. For this reason, details regarding Virgil's life story are considered somewhat problematic.<ref name="Fowler, pg.1603">Fowler, Don. 1996. "Virgil (Publius Vergilius Maro)." In ''[[Oxford Classical Dictionary|The Oxford Classical Dictionary]]'' (3rd ed.). Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]].</ref>{{Rp|1602}}

According to these accounts, Publius Vergilius Maro was born in the village of [[Virgilio, Lombardy|Andes]], near [[Mantua]]<ref group="lower-roman">The [[epitaph]] on his tomb in [[Posillipo|Posilipo]] near [[Naples]] read ''Mantua me genuit; Calabri rapuere; tenet nunc Parthenope. Cecini pascua, rura, duces'' ("Mantua gave birth to me, the Calabrians took me, now Naples holds me; I sang of pastures [the Eclogues], country [the Georgics] and leaders [the Aeneid]").</ref> in [[Cisalpine Gaul]] ([[northern Italy]], added to [[Roman Italy|Italy proper]] during his lifetime).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gottwein.de/latine/map/it_cis01.jpg|title=Map of Cisalpine Gaul|website=gottwein.de|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528150009/http://www.gottwein.de/latine/map/it_cis01.jpg|archive-date=28 May 2008}}</ref> Analysis of his name has led some to believe that he descended from earlier Roman colonists. Modern speculation, however, ultimately is not supported by narrative evidence from either his own writings or his later biographers. [[Macrobius]] says that Virgil's father was of a humble background, though scholars generally believe that Virgil was from an [[Roman aristocracy#The ordo equester under Augustus|equestrian]] landowning family who could afford to give him an education. He attended schools in [[Cremona]], [[Mediolanum]], Rome, and [[Naples]]. After briefly considering a career in [[rhetoric]] and law, the young Virgil turned his talents to poetry.<ref>Damen, Mark.

According to [[Robert Seymour Conway]], the only ancient source which reports the actual distance between Andes and Mantua is a surviving fragment from the works of [[Marcus Valerius Probus]]. Probus flourished during the reign of [[Nero]] (AD 54–68).<ref name="Conway">[[Robert Seymour Conway|Conway, Robert Seymour]]. 1967. "[https://books.google.gr/books?id=pMi2i1K2leAC&pg=PA19&dq=gens+Vergilia&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=gens%20Vergilia&f=false Where Was Vergil's Farm]." ''Harvard Lectures on the Vergilian Age.'' Biblo & Tannen. {{ISBN|978-0819601827}}. pp. 14–41.

''The article was originally sourced from [https://web.archive.org/web/20000407072702/http://www.nupedia.com/ Nupedia] and is [[open content]].''</ref> Probus reports that Andes was located 30 [[Mile#Roman mile|Roman miles]] from Mantua. Conway translated this to a distance of about {{Convert|45|km|mi|abbr=|disp=or}}.<ref name="Conway"/>

Relatively little is known about the family of Virgil. His father reportedly belonged to [[gens]] Vergilia, and his mother belonged to gens [[Magia gens|Magia]].<ref name=" Conway"/> According to Conway, gens Vergilia is poorly attested in inscriptions from the entire [[Northern Italy]], where Mantua is located. Among thousands of surviving ancient inscriptions from this region, there are only 8 or 9 mentions of individuals called "Vergilius" (masculine) or "Vergilia" (feminine). Out of these mentions, three appear in inscriptions from [[Verona]], and one in an inscription from [[Calvisano]].<ref name="Conway"/>

Conway theorized that the inscription from Calvisano had to do with a kinswoman of Virgil. Calvisano is located 30 Roman miles from Mantua, and would fit with Probus' description of Andes.<ref name="Conway"/> The inscription, in this case, is a [[votive offering]] to the [[Matres and Matronae|Matronae]] (a group of deities) by a woman called Vergilia, asking the goddesses to deliver from danger another woman, called Munatia. Conway notes that the offering belongs to a common type for this era, where women made requests for deities to preserve the lives of female loved ones who were pregnant and were about to give birth. In most cases, the woman making the request was the mother of a woman who was pregnant or otherwise in danger. Though there is another inscription from Calvisano, where a woman asks the deities to preserve the life of her sister.<ref name="Conway"/> Munatia, the woman whom Vergilia wished to protect, was likely a close relative of Vergilia, possibly her daughter. The name "Munatia" indicates that this woman was a member of gens [[Munatia (gens)|Munatia]], and makes it likely that Vergilia married into this family.<ref name="Conway"/>

===Early works===
{{Main article| Appendix Vergiliana}}
According to the commentators, Virgil received his first education when he was five years old and he later went to [[Cremona]], [[Milan]], and finally [[Rome]] to study [[rhetoric]], [[medicine]], and [[astronomy]], which he soon abandoned for philosophy. From Virgil's admiring references to the [[neoteric]] writers [[Gaius Asinius Pollio (consul 40 BC)|Pollio]] and [[Helvius Cinna|Cinna]], it has been inferred that he was, for a time, associated with [[Catullus]]' neoteric circle. According to [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]], schoolmates considered Virgil extremely shy and reserved, and he was nicknamed "Parthenias" or "maiden" because of his social aloofness. Virgil also seems to have suffered bad health throughout his life and in some ways lived the life of an invalid. According to the ''[[Appendix Vergiliana#Catalepton ("Trifles")|Catalepton]]'', he began to write poetry while in the [[Epicurean]] school of [[Siro the Epicurean|Siro]] in Naples. A group of small works attributed to the youthful Virgil by the commentators survive collected under the title ''[[Appendix Vergiliana]]'', but are largely considered spurious by scholars. One, the ''Catalepton'', consists of fourteen short poems,<ref name="Fowler, pg.1603" />{{Rp|1602}} some of which may be Virgil's, and another, a short narrative poem titled the ''[[Appendix Vergiliana#Culex ("The Gnat")|Culex]]'' ("The Gnat"), was attributed to Virgil as early as the 1st century AD.

===The ''Eclogues''===
{{Main article| Eclogues}}
[[File:RomanVirgilFolio001rEclogues.jpg|thumb|Page from the beginning of the ''Eclogues'' in the 5th-century ''Vergilius Romanus'']]

The biographical tradition asserts that Virgil began the hexameter ''[[Eclogues]]'' (or ''Bucolics'') in 42 BC and it is thought that the collection was published around 39–38 BC, although this is controversial.<ref name="Fowler, pg.1603" />{{Rp|1602}} The ''Eclogues'' (from the Greek for "selections") are a group of ten poems roughly modeled on the [[bucolic]] (that is, "pastoral" or "rural") poetry  of the Hellenistic poet [[Theocritus]], which were written in [[Dactylic hexameter|dactylic hexameter]]. After defeating the army led by the [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|assassins]] of [[Julius Caesar]] in the [[Battle of Philippi]] (42 BC), [[Octavian]] tried to pay off his veterans with land expropriated from towns in northern Italy, which—according to tradition—included an estate near Mantua belonging to Virgil. The loss of Virgil's family farm and the attempt through poetic petitions to regain his property have traditionally been seen as his motives in the composition of the ''Eclogues''. This is now thought to be an unsupported inference from interpretations of the ''Eclogues''. In ''Eclogues'' 1 and 9, Virgil indeed dramatizes the contrasting feelings caused by the brutality of the land expropriations through pastoral idiom but offers no indisputable evidence of the supposed biographic incident. While some readers have identified the poet himself with various characters and their vicissitudes, whether gratitude by an old rustic to a new god (''Ecl''. 1), frustrated love by a rustic singer for a distant boy (his master's pet, ''Ecl''. 2), or a master singer's claim to have composed several eclogues (''Ecl''. 5), modern scholars largely reject such efforts to garner biographical details from works of fiction, preferring to interpret an author's characters and themes as illustrations of contemporary life and thought.
The ten ''Eclogues'' present traditional pastoral themes with a fresh perspective. Eclogues 1 and 9 address the land confiscations and their effects on the Italian countryside. 2 and 3 are pastoral and erotic, discussing both homosexual love (''Ecl''. 2) and attraction toward people of any gender (''Ecl''. 3). [[Eclogue 4|''Eclogue'' 4]], addressed to [[Asinius Pollio]], the so-called "Messianic Eclogue", uses the imagery of the golden age in connection with the birth of a child (who the child was meant to be has been subject to debate). 5 and 8 describe the myth of [[Daphnis]] in a song contest, 6, the cosmic and mythological song of [[Silenus]]; 7, a heated poetic contest, and 10 the sufferings of the contemporary elegiac poet [[Cornelius Gallus]]. Virgil is credited{{by whom|date=August 2011}} in the ''Eclogues'' with establishing [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadia]] as a poetic ideal that still resonates in Western literature and visual arts, and setting the stage for the development of Latin pastoral by [[Calpurnius Siculus]], [[Nemesianus]] and later writers.

===The ''Georgics''===
{{Main article| Georgics}}
Sometime after the publication of the ''Eclogues'' (probably before 37 BC),<ref name="Fowler, pg.1603"/>{{Rp|1603}} Virgil became part of the circle of [[Maecenas]], Octavian's capable ''agent d'affaires'' who sought to counter sympathy for Antony among the leading families by rallying Roman literary figures to Octavian's side. Virgil came to know many of the other leading literary figures of the time, including [[Horace]], in whose poetry he is often mentioned,<ref>[[Horace]], ''[[Satires (Horace)|Satires]]'' 1.5, 1.6; Horace, [[Odes (Horace)|''Odes'']] 1.3</ref> and [[Varius Rufus]], who later helped finish the ''Aeneid''.

[[File:Przygotowanie narzędzi rolniczych.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|Late 17th-century illustration of a passage from the ''Georgics'' by [[Jerzy Siemiginowski-Eleuter]]]]

At Maecenas' insistence (according to the tradition) Virgil spent the ensuing years (perhaps 37–29 BC) on the long didactic hexameter poem called the ''[[Georgics]]'' (from Greek, "On Working the Earth") which he dedicated to Maecenas. The ostensible theme of the ''Georgics'' is instruction in the methods of running a farm. In handling this theme, Virgil follows in the [[didactic]] ("how to") tradition of the Greek poet [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Works and Days]]'' and several works of the later Hellenistic poets. The four books of the ''Georgics'' focus respectively on raising crops and trees (1 and 2), livestock and horses (3), and beekeeping and the qualities of bees (4). Well-known passages include the beloved ''Laus Italiae'' of Book 2, the prologue description of the temple in Book 3, and the description of the plague at the end of Book 3. Book 4 concludes with a long mythological narrative, in the form of an ''[[epyllion]]'' which describes vividly the discovery of beekeeping by [[Aristaeus]] and the story of [[Orpheus]]' journey to the underworld. Ancient scholars, such as [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]], conjectured that the Aristaeus episode replaced, at the emperor's request, a long section in praise of Virgil's friend, the poet Gallus, who was disgraced by [[Augustus]], and who committed suicide in 26 BC.

The ''Georgics''{{'}} tone wavers between optimism and pessimism, sparking critical debate on the poet's intentions,<ref name="Fowler, pg.1603" />{{Rp|1605}} but the work lays the foundations for later didactic poetry. Virgil and Maecenas are said to have taken turns reading the ''Georgics'' to Octavian upon his return from defeating Antony and [[Cleopatra]] at the [[Battle of Actium]] in 31 BC.

===The ''Aeneid''===
{{Main article|Aeneid}}
[[File:Terracotta Aeneas MAN Naples 110338.jpg|thumb|left|A 1st-century terracotta expressing the ''[[pietas]]'' of Aeneas, who carries his aged father and leads his young son]]

The ''[[Aeneid]]'' is widely considered Virgil's finest work, and is regarded as one of the most important poems in the history of Western literature ([[T. S. Eliot]] referred to it as 'the classic of all Europe').<ref>[[T. S. Eliot|Eliot, T. S.]] 1944. [http://bracchiumforte.com/PDFs/tseliot.pdf ''What Is a Classic?'']. London: [[Faber & Faber]].</ref> The work (modelled after [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'') chronicles a refugee of the [[Trojan War]], named [[Aeneas]], as he struggles to fulfill his destiny. His intentions are to reach Italy, where his descendants [[Romulus and Remus]] are to found the city of Rome.

Virgil worked on the ''Aeneid'' during the last eleven years of his life (29–19 BC), commissioned, according to [[Propertius]], by [[Augustus]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Avery|first1=W. T.|year=1957|title=Augustus and the "Aeneid"|journal=The Classical Journal|volume=52|issue=5|pages=225–29}}</ref> The epic poem consists of 12 books in [[dactylic hexameter]] verse which describe the journey of [[Aeneas]], a warrior fleeing the sack of Troy, to Italy, his battle with the Italian prince Turnus, and the foundation of a city from which Rome would emerge. The ''Aeneid''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s first six books describe the journey of Aeneas from Troy to Rome. Virgil made use of several models in the composition of his epic;<ref name="Fowler, pg.1603" />{{Rp|1603}} Homer, the pre-eminent author of classical epic, is everywhere present, but Virgil also makes special use of the Latin poet [[Ennius]] and the Hellenistic poet [[Apollonius of Rhodes]] among the various other writers to which he alludes. Although the ''Aeneid'' casts itself firmly into the epic mode, it often seeks to expand the genre by including elements of other genres such as tragedy and aetiological poetry. Ancient commentators noted that Virgil seems to divide the ''Aeneid'' into two sections based on the poetry of Homer; the first six books were viewed as employing the ''[[Odyssey]]'' as a model while the last six were connected to the ''[[Iliad]]''.<ref>Jenkyns, p. 53</ref>

Book 1<ref group="lower-roman">For a succinct summary, see [http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~loxias/aeneid.htm Globalnet.co.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091218115544/http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~loxias/aeneid.htm |date=18 December 2009 }}</ref> (at the head of the Odyssean section) opens with a storm which [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], Aeneas' enemy throughout the poem, stirs up against the fleet. The storm drives the hero to the coast of [[Carthage]], which historically was Rome's deadliest foe. The queen, [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]], welcomes the ancestor of the Romans, and under the influence of the gods falls deeply in love with him. At a banquet in Book 2, Aeneas tells the story of the sack of [[Troy]], the death of his wife, and his escape, to the enthralled Carthaginians, while in Book 3 he recounts to them his wanderings over the Mediterranean in search of a suitable new home. [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]] in Book 4 recalls the lingering Aeneas to his duty to found a new city, and he slips away from Carthage, leaving Dido to commit suicide, cursing Aeneas and calling down revenge in symbolic anticipation of the fierce wars between Carthage and Rome. In Book 5, funeral games are celebrated for Aeneas' father [[Anchises]], who had died a year before. On reaching [[Cumae]], in Italy in Book 6, Aeneas consults the [[Cumaean Sibyl]], who conducts him through the [[Underworld]] where Aeneas meets the dead Anchises who reveals Rome's destiny to his son.

Book 7 (beginning the Iliadic half) opens with an address to the muse and recounts Aeneas' arrival in Italy and betrothal to [[Lavinia]], daughter of King [[Latinus]]. Lavinia had already been promised to [[Turnus]], the king of the [[Rutuli]]ans, who is roused to war by the [[Erinyes|Fury]] [[Allecto]], and [[Amata]] Lavinia's mother. In Book 8, Aeneas allies with [[Evander of Pallene|King Evander]], who occupies the future site of Rome, and is given new armor and a shield depicting Roman history. Book 9 records an assault by [[Nisus and Euryalus]] on the Rutulians; Book 10, the death of Evander's young son [[Pallas (son of Evander)|Pallas]]; and 11 the death of the Volscian warrior princess [[Camilla (mythology)|Camilla]] and the decision to settle the war with a duel between Aeneas and Turnus. The ''Aeneid'' ends in Book 12 with the taking of Latinus' city, the death of Amata, and Aeneas' defeat and killing of Turnus, whose pleas for mercy are spurned. The final book ends with the image of Turnus' soul lamenting as it flees to the underworld.

===Reception of the ''Aeneid''===
<!-- {{main|Reception of the Aeneid}} -->
[[File:Virgil Reading the Aeneid.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|''Virgil Reading the'' Aeneid ''to Augustus, Octavia, and Livia'' by [[Jean-Baptiste Wicar]], Art Institute of Chicago]]

Critics of the ''Aeneid'' focus on a variety of issues.<ref group="lower-roman">For a bibliography and summary see Fowler, pp. 1605–1606</ref> The tone of the poem as a whole is a particular matter of debate; some see the poem as ultimately pessimistic and politically subversive to the Augustan regime, while others view it as a celebration of the new imperial dynasty. Virgil makes use of the symbolism of the Augustan regime, and some scholars see strong associations between Augustus and Aeneas, the one as founder and the other as re-founder of Rome. A strong [[teleology]], or drive towards a climax, has been detected in the poem. The ''Aeneid'' is full of prophecies about the future of Rome, the deeds of Augustus, his ancestors, and famous Romans, and the [[Carthaginian Wars]]; the shield of Aeneas even depicts Augustus' victory at [[Battle of Actium|Actium]] against [[Mark Antony]] and [[Cleopatra VII]] in 31 BC. A further focus of study is the character of Aeneas. As the protagonist of the poem, Aeneas seems to waver constantly between his emotions and commitment to his prophetic duty to found Rome; critics note the breakdown of Aeneas' emotional control in the last sections of the poem where the "pious" and "righteous" Aeneas mercilessly slaughters Turnus.

The ''Aeneid'' appears to have been a great success. Virgil is said to have recited Books 2, 4, and 6 to Augustus;<ref name="Fowler, pg.1603" />{{Rp|1603}} and Book 6 apparently caused the emperor's sister [[Octavia the Younger|Octavia]] to faint. Although the truth of this claim is subject to scholarly skepticism, it has served as a basis for later art, such as [[Jean-Baptiste Wicar]]'s ''Virgil Reading the Aeneid''.

Unfortunately, some lines of the poem were left unfinished, and the whole was unedited, at Virgil's death in 19 BC.

===Virgil's death and editing of the ''Aeneid''===
According to the tradition, Virgil traveled to the [[senatorial province]] of [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]] in Greece in about 19 BC to revise the ''Aeneid''. After meeting Augustus in Athens and deciding to return home, Virgil caught a fever while visiting a town near [[Megara]]. After crossing to Italy by ship, weakened with disease, Virgil died in [[Brundisium]] harbor on 21 September 19 BC. Augustus ordered Virgil's literary executors, [[Lucius Varius Rufus]] and [[Plotius Tucca]], to disregard Virgil's own wish [[Book burning#Posthumous destruction of works|that the poem be burned]], instead ordering it to be published with as few editorial changes as possible.<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Virgil|volume=28|pages=111–116|last1=Sellar|first1=William Young |author-link1=William Young Sellar |last2=Glover|first2=Terrot Reaveley|author2-link=Terrot Reaveley Glover|last3=Bryant|first3=Margaret}}</ref>{{rp|112}} As a result, the text of the ''Aeneid'' that exists may contain faults which Virgil was planning to correct before publication. However, the only obvious imperfections are a few lines of verse that are metrically unfinished (i.e. not a complete line of [[dactylic hexameter]]). Some scholars have argued that Virgil deliberately left these metrically incomplete lines for dramatic effect.<ref>Miller, F. J. 1909. "Evidences of Incompleteness in the "Aeneid" of Vergil." ''[[The Classical Journal]]'' 4(11):341–55. {{JSTOR|3287376}}.</ref> Other alleged imperfections are subject to scholarly debate.

=== Antiquity ===
The works of Virgil almost from the moment of their publication revolutionized [[Latin poetry]]. The ''Eclogues'', ''Georgics'', and above all the ''Aeneid'' became standard texts in school curricula with which all educated Romans were familiar. Poets following Virgil often refer intertextually to his works to generate meaning in their own poetry. The Augustan poet [[Ovid]] parodies the opening lines of the ''Aeneid'' in ''[[Amores (Ovid)|Amores]]'' 1.1.1–2, and his summary of the Aeneas story in Book 14 of the ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', the so-called "mini-Aeneid", has been viewed as a particularly important example of post-Virgilian response to the epic genre. [[Lucan]]'s epic, the ''[[Pharsalia|Bellum Civile]]'', has been considered an anti-Virgilian epic, disposing of the divine mechanism, treating historical events, and diverging drastically from Virgilian epic practice. The Flavian poet [[Statius]] in his 12-book epic ''Thebaid'' engages closely with the poetry of Virgil; in his epilogue he advises his poem not to "rival the divine ''Aeneid'', but follow afar and ever venerate its footsteps."<ref>Theb.12.816–817</ref> In [[Silius Italicus]], Virgil finds one of his most ardent admirers. With almost every line of his epic ''[[Punica (poem)|Punica]]'', Silius references Virgil. Indeed, Silius is known to have bought Virgil's tomb and worshipped the poet.<ref>Pliny ''Ep''. 3.7.8</ref> Partially as a result of his so-called "Messianic" [[Eclogue 4|Fourth Eclogue]]{{snd}}widely interpreted later to have predicted the [[Nativity of Jesus|birth of Jesus Christ]]{{snd}}Virgil was in later antiquity imputed to have the magical abilities of a seer; the ''[[Sortes Vergilianae]]'', the process of using Virgil's poetry as a tool of divination, is found in the time of [[Hadrian]], and continued into the Middle Ages. In a similar vein Macrobius in the ''[[Macrobius#Saturnalia|Saturnalia]]'' credits the work of Virgil as the embodiment of human knowledge and experience, mirroring the Greek conception of Homer.<ref name="Fowler, pg.1603" />{{Rp|1603}}  Virgil also found commentators in antiquity. [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]], a commentator of the 4th century AD, based his work on the commentary of [[Aelius Donatus|Donatus]]. Servius' commentary provides us with a great deal of information about Virgil's life, sources, and references; however, many modern scholars find the variable quality of his work and the often simplistic interpretations frustrating.

=== Late antiquity ===
[[File:Vergil tomb inscription.jpg|alt=The verse inscription at Virgil's tomb.|thumb|The verse inscription at Virgil's tomb was supposedly composed by the poet himself: ''Mantua me genuit, Calabri rapuere, tenet nunc Parthenope. Cecini pascua, rura, duces.'' ("[[Mantua]] gave me life, the [[Salento|Calabrians]] took it away, [[Naples]] holds me now; I sang of pastures, farms, and commanders" [transl. [[Bernard Knox]]])]]
Even as the Western Roman Empire collapsed, literate men acknowledged that Virgil was a master poet – [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]], for example, confessing how he had wept at reading the death of Dido.<ref>K. W. Gransden, ''Virgil: The Aeneid'' (Cambridge 1990), p. 105.</ref> The best-known surviving manuscripts of Virgil's works include manuscripts from late antiquity such as the ''[[Vergilius Augusteus]]'', the ''[[Vergilius Vaticanus]]'' and the ''[[Vergilius Romanus]]''.

=== Middle Ages ===
[[Gregory of Tours]] read Virgil, whom he quotes in several places, along with some other Latin poets, though he cautions that "we ought not to relate their lying fables, lest we fall under sentence of eternal death".{{sfn|Gregory of Tours|1916|p=xiii}} In the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]], [[Alexander Neckham]] placed the "divine" ''Aeneid'' on his standard arts curriculum,<ref>[[Helen Waddell]], ''The Wandering Scholars'' (Fontana 1968), p. 19.</ref> and Dido became the romantic heroine of the age.<ref>Waddell, pp. 22–3.</ref> Monks like [[Maiolus of Cluny]] might repudiate what they called "the luxurious eloquence of Virgil",<ref>Waddell, p. 101.</ref> but they could not deny the power of his appeal.

[[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] made Virgil his guide in [[Hell]] and the greater part of [[Purgatory]] in the ''[[Divine Comedy]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Divine Comedy (The Inferno, The Purgatorio, and The Paradiso)|last=Alighieri|first=Dante|publisher=Berkley|year=2003|isbn=978-0451208637|location=New York}}</ref> Dante also mentions Virgil in ''[[De vulgari eloquentia]]'', along with [[Ovid]], [[Marcus Annaeus Lucanus|Lucan]] and [[Statius]], as one of the four ''regulati poetae'' (ii, vi, 7).

=== Renaissance and early modernity ===
The Renaissance saw a number of authors inspired to write epic in Virgil's wake: [[Edmund Spenser]] called himself the English Virgil; ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' was influenced by the example of the ''Aeneid''; and later artists influenced by Virgil include [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]] and [[Hermann Broch]].<ref>Gransden, pp. 108–111.</ref>

===Legends===
The legend of "Virgil in his basket" arose in the [[Middle Ages]], and is often seen in art and mentioned in literature as part of the [[Power of Women]] [[literary topos]], demonstrating the disruptive force of female attractiveness on men. In this story Virgil became enamored of a beautiful woman, sometimes described as the emperor's daughter or mistress and called Lucretia.  She played him along and agreed to an assignation at her house, which he was to sneak into at night by climbing into a large basket let down from a window.  When he did so he was hoisted only halfway up the wall and then left trapped there into the next day, exposed to public ridicule.  The story paralleled that of [[Tale of Phyllis and Aristotle|Phyllis riding Aristotle]].  Among other artists depicting the scene, [[Lucas van Leyden]] made a [[woodcut]] and later an [[engraving]].<ref>[[James Snyder (art historian)|Snyder, James]]. 1985. ''Northern Renaissance Art''. US: [[Abrams Books|Harry N. Abrams]], {{ISBN|0136235964}}. pp. 461–62.</ref>

In the Middle Ages, Virgil's reputation was such that it inspired legends associating him with magic and prophecy. From at least the 3rd century, Christian thinkers interpreted [[Eclogue 4|''Eclogue'' 4]], which describes the birth of a boy ushering in a golden age, as a prediction of [[Nativity of Jesus|Jesus' birth]]. In consequence, Virgil came to be seen on a similar level to the [[Bible prophecy|Hebrew prophets of the Bible]] as one who had heralded Christianity.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ziolkowski|first1=Jan M.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MpsPueOp8cUC|title=The Virgilian Tradition: The First Fifteen Hundred Years|last2=Putnam|first2=Michael C. J.|date=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300108224|pages=xxxiv-xxxv|access-date=11 November 2013}}</ref> Relatedly, ''[[The Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' argues that medieval legends about the [[golem]] may have been inspired by Virgilian legends about the poet's apocryphal power to bring inanimate objects to life.<ref>{{Jewish Encyclopedia |no-prescript=1 |title=Golem}}</ref>

Possibly as early as the second century AD, Virgil's works were seen as having magical properties and were used for [[divination]]. In what became known as the ''[[Sortes Vergilianae]]'' ('Virgilian Lots'), passages would be selected at random and interpreted to answer questions.<ref name=Ziolkowskixxxiv>{{cite book|last1=Ziolkowski|first1=Jan M.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MpsPueOp8cUC|title=The Virgilian Tradition: The First Fifteen Hundred Years|last2=Putnam|first2=Michael C. J.|date=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300108224|page=xxxiv|access-date=11 November 2013}}</ref> In the 12th century, starting around [[Naples]] but eventually spreading widely throughout Europe, a tradition developed in which Virgil was regarded as a great [[Magician (paranormal)|magician]]. Legends about Virgil and his magical powers remained popular for over two hundred years, arguably becoming as prominent as his writings themselves.<ref name=Ziolkowskixxxiv/> Virgil's legacy in medieval [[Wales]] was such that the Welsh version of his name, ''[[Fferyllt]]'' or ''Pheryllt'', became a generic term for magic-worker, and survives in the modern Welsh word for pharmacist, ''fferyllydd''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ziolkowski|first1=Jan M.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MpsPueOp8cUC|title=The Virgilian Tradition: The First Fifteen Hundred Years|last2=Putnam|first2=Michael C. J.|date=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300108224|pages=101–102|access-date=11 November 2013}}</ref>[[File:Parco della Grotta di Posillipo3.jpg|alt=Tomb of Virgil in Naples, Italy|thumb|[[Virgil's tomb|Tomb of Virgil]] in Naples, Italy]]

=== Virgil's tomb ===
The structure known as "[[Virgil's tomb]]" is found at the entrance of an ancient Roman tunnel (aka {{lang|it|grotta vecchia}}) in [[Piedigrotta]], a district {{Convert|3|km|mi|abbr=}} from the centre of [[Naples]], near the [[Mergellina]] harbor, on the road heading north along the coast to [[Pozzuoli]]. While Virgil was already the object of literary admiration and veneration before his death, in the Middle Ages his name became associated with miraculous powers, and for a couple of centuries his tomb was the destination of [[pilgrimage]]s and veneration.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_K0UJAAAAIAAJ| title=The Book of Days | publisher=W and R Chambers | author=Chambers, Robert | year=1832 | location=London | pages=366}}</ref>
== Spelling of name ==
By the fourth or fifth century AD the original spelling ''Vergilius'' had been changed to ''Virgilius'', and then the latter spelling spread to the modern European languages.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Comparetti|first1=Domenico|title=Vergil in the Middle Ages|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0691026787|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-6wGE9Ylmj4C&pg=PR7|access-date=23 November 2016|language=en|year=1997}}</ref> The later spelling persisted even though, as early as the 15th century, the classical scholar [[Poliziano]] had shown ''Vergilius'' to be the original spelling.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wilson-Okamura|first1=David Scott|title=Virgil in the Renaissance|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521198127|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WTaNUGscVhIC&pg=PA15|access-date=23 November 2016|language=en|year=2010}}</ref> Today, the [[Anglicisation|anglicizations]] ''Vergil'' and ''Virgil'' are both acceptable.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Winkler|first1=Anthony C.|last2=McCuen-Metherell|first2=Jo Ray|title=Writing the Research Paper: A Handbook|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1133169024|page=278|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PUMIAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA278|access-date=23 November 2016|language=en|year=2011}}</ref>

There is some speculation that the spelling ''Virgilius'' might have arisen due to a pun, since ''virg-'' carries an echo of the Latin word for 'wand' (''uirga''), Vergil being particularly associated with magic in the [[Middle Ages]]. There is also a possibility that ''virg-'' is meant to evoke the Latin ''virgo'' ('virgin'); this would be a reference to the [[Eclogue 4|fourth ''Eclogue'']], which has a history of Christian, and specifically [[Messianism|Messianic]], [[Christian interpretations of Virgil's Eclogue 4|interpretations]].<ref group="lower-roman">For more discussion on the spelling of Virgil's name, see Flickinger, R. C. 1930. "Vergil or Virgil?." ''[[The Classical Journal]]'' 25(9):658–60.</ref>
