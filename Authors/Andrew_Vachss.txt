== Writings ==
Andrew Vachss is the author of 33 novels and three collections of [[short story|short stories]], as well as poetry, plays, song [[lyrics]], and [[graphic novel]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vachss.com/trojan.html |title=Index of author's written works |publisher=Vachss.com |access-date=2014-09-16}}</ref>
As a novelist, he is perhaps best known for his [[Andrew Vachss#The Burke series|Burke series]] of hardboiled mysteries; ''Another Life''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vachss.com/av_novels/index_theburkeseries.html |title=Finale of Burke series |publisher=Vachss.com |date=2011-02-28 |access-date=2012-02-02}}</ref> constituted the finale to the series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vachss.com/anotherlife/index.html |title=US publication date of Another Life |publisher=Vachss.com |access-date=2012-02-02}}</ref>

After completing the Burke novels, Vachss began two new series. Vachss released the first novel in the Dell & Dolly trilogy, entitled ''Aftershock'', in 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://vachss.com/av_novels/aftershock.html|title = Aftershock by Andrew Vachss|access-date = 2014-09-16|website = THE ZERO|publisher = vachss.com}}</ref> The second novel, ''Shockwave'', was released in 2014,<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://vachss.com/av_novels/shockwave.html|title = Shockwave by Andrew Vachss|access-date = 2015-08-29|website = THE ZERO|publisher = vachss.com}}</ref> and ''Signwave'', the final book, was published in June 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://vachss.com/av_novels/signwave.html|title = Signwave by Andrew Vachss|access-date = 2015-08-29|website = THE ZERO|publisher = vachss.com}}</ref> Radically departing from Vachss' familiar urban settings, the trilogy focuses on Dell, a former soldier and assassin, and Dolly, a former nurse with [[Doctors Without Borders]] and the love of Dell's life. While living in the [[Pacific Northwest]], Dell and Dolly use their war-honed skills to maintain a "heads on stakes" barrier against the predators who use their everyday positions in the community as camouflage in order to attack the vulnerable.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://sonsofspade.blogspot.com/2014/07/aftershock-dell-by-andrew-vachss.html|title = Aftershock by Andrew Vachss, reviewed by Sons of Spade|access-date = 2015-08-29|website = Sons of Spade|date = 8 July 2014}}</ref>

The Cross series uses distinctive supernatural aspects to further explore Vachss' argument that society's failure to protect its children is the greatest threat to the human species. In 2012, Vachss' published ''Blackjack: A Cross Novel'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vachss.com/av_novels/blackjack.html |title=Blackjack: A Cross Novel |publisher=Vachss.com |access-date=2012-07-10}}</ref> featuring the mercenary Cross Crew, introduced in earlier Vachss short stories as Chicago's most-feared criminal gang. ''Urban Renewal'', the second novel in the Cross series, came out in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vachss.com/av_novels/urbanrenewal.html |title=Urban Renewal: A Cross Novel |publisher=Vachss.com |access-date=2015-08-29}}</ref> The third in the series, ''Drawing Dead'', was released in 2016.

In addition to the ''Aftershock'', ''Burke'', and ''Cross'' series, Vachss has written several stand-alone works. The first novel he published outside the Burke series was ''Shella.'' Released in 1993, ''Shella'' was the most polarizing of his works in terms of critical response.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vachss.com/av_novels/shella.html |title=Shella |publisher=Vachss.com |access-date=2015-08-30}}</ref>  Vachss often referred to ''Shella'' as his "beloved orphan"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vachss.com/av_interviews/case_2004.html |title=The World As They See It: Andrew Vachss |publisher=Vachss.com |access-date=2015-08-30}}</ref>  until the 2004 release of ''The Getaway Man'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vachss.com/getaway_man/index.html |title=The Getaway Man |publisher=Vachss.com |access-date=2015-08-30}}</ref> a tribute to the Gold Medal paperback originals of the 1960s. In 2005, Vachss released the epic ''Two Trains Running'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.twotrainsrunning.com |title=Two Trains Running |access-date=2015-08-30}}</ref> a novel which takes place entirely during a two-week span in 1959, a critical period in American history. In form, ''Two Trains Running'' presents as a work composed entirely of transcribed surveillance tapes,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vachss.com/av_interviews/cobrapost.html |title=Reinventing Vachss, by Adam Dunn |access-date=2015-08-30}}</ref> akin to a [[collage film]] constructed only of footage from a single source. His 2009 novel, ''Haiku'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vachss.com/haiku |title=Haiku |publisher=Vachss.com |access-date=2012-02-02}}</ref> focuses on the troubled lives of a band of homeless men in New York City, struggling to connect with and protect each other. In 2010, Vachss published two books: his novel ''The Weight'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vachss.com/av_novels/weight.html |title=The Weight |publisher=Vachss.com |access-date=2012-02-02}}</ref> is a noir romance involving a professional thief and a young widow in hiding. ''Heart Transplant'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vachss.com/av_novels/heart.html |title=Heart Transplant |publisher=Vachss.com |date=2010-10-19 |access-date=2012-02-02}}</ref> an illustrated novel in an experimental design, tells the story of an abused and bullied young boy who finds his inner strength with the help of an unexpected mentor.

Vachss has also written non-fiction, including numerous articles and essays on child protection<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vachss.com/av_dispatches.html |title=Articles and essays on child protection |publisher=Vachss.com |access-date=2012-02-02}}</ref> and a book on juvenile criminology.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2bwrr3dW8I |title=On designing prisons for violent youth, Andrew Vachss interview, 2009 |publisher=Youtube.com |access-date=2012-02-02}}</ref> His books have been translated into 20 languages, and his shorter works have appeared in many publications, including ''[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]'', ''[[Antaeus]]'', ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', ''[[Playboy]]'', and ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.twotrainsrunning.com/about-vachss.html |title=Magazines |publisher=Twotrainsrunning.com |access-date=2012-02-02}}</ref> Vachss' literary awards include the [[Grand Prix de Littérature Policière]] for ''[[Strega (novel)|Strega]]'' [as ''La Sorcière de Brooklyn'']; the [[Falcon Award]], Maltese Falcon Society of Japan, for ''Strega''; the [[Deutscher Krimi Preis]] for ''Flood'' [as ''Kata'']; and the [[Courmayeur Noir Film Festival|Raymond Chandler Award]] for his body of work.

Andrew Vachss is a member of [[PEN American Center|PEN]] and the [[Writers Guild of America]]. His autobiographical essay was added by invitation to ''Contemporary Authors'' in 2003.

=== Child protection ===
Many of Vachss' novels feature the shadowy, unlicensed [[private investigator|investigator]] [[Burke (character)|Burke]], an [[convict|ex-con]], [[criminal|career criminal]], and deeply conflicted character.  About his [[protagonist]], Vachss says:

{{quotation|If you look at Burke closely, you'll see the prototypical abused child: [[Hypervigilance|hypervigilant]], distrustful.  He's so committed to his family of choice—not his [[DNA]]-[[Family#Western kinship|biological family]], which [[torture]]d him, or the state which raised him, but the family that he chose—that homicide is a natural consequence of injuring any of that family. He's not a [[hit man]]. But he shares the same religion I do, which is [[revenge]].|Andrew Vachss, ''Horror Online'', May 1999.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.darkecho.com/darkecho/horroronline/vachss.html |title="Andrew Vachss: A Man Who Will Die Trying", by Paula Guran, ''Horror Online,'' May 1999 |publisher=Darkecho.com |access-date=2012-02-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213151250/http://www.darkecho.com/darkecho/horroronline/vachss.html |archive-date=2012-02-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref>}}

Vachss coined the phrase "''Children of the Secret''", which refers to abused children, of whatever age, who were victimized without ever experiencing justice, much less love and protection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vachss.com/av_interviews/buffalo_news_95.html |title=Children of the Secret |publisher=Vachss.com |date=1995-11-13 |access-date=2012-02-02}}</ref> In the Burke novels, some of these Children of the Secret have banded together as adults into what Vachss calls a "family of choice".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nop7SeuqzP0 |title=Andrew Vachss discusses his use of "family of choice", Family of Choice webcast, January 14, 2009 |publisher=Youtube.com |access-date=2012-02-02}}</ref> Their connection is not biological, and they form very loyal bonds. Most are career criminals; none allows the law to come before the duty to family.

Vachss originated the term "''Circle of Trust.''"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vachss.com/av_dispatches/circle.html |title=Abuse within the Circle of Trust |publisher=Vachss.com |date=2011 |access-date=2015-08-30}}</ref> which has since entered general circulation. Vachss coined the term to combat the mistaken over-emphasis on "stranger danger,"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vachss.com/av_interviews/c_moore.html |title=Andrew Vachss Doesn't Fight Fair: A Conversation with Clayton Moore |publisher=Vachss.com |date=2003-02-24 |access-date=2015-08-30}}</ref> a bias that prevents society from focusing on the most common way children are accessed for victimization:

{{quotation|The biggest threat to children is always inside their houses. The predator with the ski-mask who grabs the kid out of a van, while a real thing, is a tiny percentage of those who prey upon children. Most victimization of children is within the ''Circle of Trust'' — not necessarily a parent, but somebody who was let into that circle, who can be a counselor, or a coach, or someone at a day-care center. The biggest danger to children is that they're perceived as property, not human beings. | An Interview with Andrew Vachss, ''The AV Club'', November 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vachss.com/av_interviews/int_onion.html |title="An Interview with Andrew Vachss," by John Krewson |access-date=2015-08-30}}</ref>}}

Another term Vachss originated is "''Transcenders.''"

{{quotation|I believe that many people who were abused as children do themselves—and the entire struggle—a disservice when they refer to themselves as "survivors." A long time ago, I found myself in the middle of a war zone. I was not killed. Hence, I "survived." That was happenstance ... just plain luck, not due to any greatness of character or heroism on my part. But what about those raised in a POW camp called "childhood?" Some of those children not only lived through it, not only refused to imitate the oppressor (evil is a decision, not a destiny), but actually maintained sufficient empathy to care about the protection of other children once they themselves became adults and were "out of danger."
To me, such people are our greatest heroes. They represent the hope of our species, living proof that there is nothing bio–genetic about child abuse. I call them transcenders, because "surviving" (i.e., not dying from) child abuse is not the significant thing. It is when chance becomes choice that people distinguish themselves. Two little children are abused. Neither dies. One grows up and becomes a child abuser. The other becomes a child protector. One "passes it on." One "breaks the cycle." Should we call them both by the same name? Not in my book. (And not in my books, either.) <ref>{{cite web|url=http://vachss.com/transcender.html |title=Survivors and Transcenders}}</ref>}}

=== Dogs ===
Another important theme that pervades Vachss' work is his love of dogs, particularly breeds considered "dangerous," such as [[Doberman]] pinschers, [[rottweilers]], and especially [[American Pit Bull Terrier|pit bulls]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vachss.com/av_interviews/int_blur.html |title="A Conversation with Andrew Vachss," ''Blur Magazine,'' March 1997 |publisher=Vachss.com |access-date=2012-02-02}}</ref> Throughout his writings,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vachss.com/dogs/dog_stories/index.html |title=Dog stories |publisher=Vachss.com |access-date=2012-02-02}}</ref> Vachss asserts that with dogs, just as with humans, "you get what you raise."<ref>{{cite news|author =Ski apps |url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/columnists/ian-odoherty/goodbye-burke-hello-andrew-1606436.html |title="Goodbye Burke, Hello Andrew," ''The Independent,'' January 19, 2009 |publisher=Independent.ie |date= 2009-01-19|access-date=2012-02-02}}</ref>

{{quotation|"There's a very specific formula for creating a monster," Vachss says. "It starts with chronic, unrelenting abuse. There's got to be societal notification and then passing on. The child eventually believes that what's being done is societally sanctioned. And after a while, [[empathy]] – which we have to learn, we're not born with it – cracks and dies. He feels only his own pain. There's your predatory [[Psychopathy|sociopath]]."
That's why Vachss posed for a recent publicity photo cradling his pit bull puppy. "You know what pit bulls are capable of, right?" he asks, referring to the animal's notorious killer reputation. "But they're also capable of being the most wonderful, sweet pets in the world, depending on how you raise them. That's all our children."|"Unleashing the Criminal Mind," ''San Francisco Examiner'', July 12, 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vachss.com/av_articles/rtcl_sfex.html |title="Unleashing the Criminal Mind," ''San Francisco Examiner,'' July 12, 1990 |publisher=Vachss.com |date=1990-07-12 |access-date=2012-02-02}}</ref>}}

He is a passionate advocate against [[animal abuse]] such as [[Dog fighting in the United States|dog-fighting]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vachss.com/dogs/dog_stories/dead_game.html |title="Dead Game," by Andrew Vachss |publisher=Vachss.com |access-date=2015-08-29}}</ref> and against [[breed-specific legislation|breed-specific legislative bans]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vachss.com/media/righteous/ascione.html |title=Breed-specific legislation |publisher=Vachss.com |access-date=2012-02-02}}</ref> With fellow crime writer James Colbert, Vachss has trained dogs to serve as [[therapy dog]]s for abused children. The dogs have a calming effect on traumatized children. Vachss notes that using these particular breeds further increases the victims' feelings of security; their "dangerous" appearance, in combination with the extensive therapy training, makes them excellent protection against human threats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vachss.com/dogs/vachss_dog.html |title=Training assistance dogs for child protection proceedings |publisher=Vachss.com |date=1994-11-04 |access-date=2012-02-02}}</ref> During her time as chief prosecutor, Alice Vachss regularly brought one such trained dog, Sheba, to work with abused children being interviewed at the Special Victims Bureau.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vachss.com/dogs/av_dogs/sheba.html |title=Sheba, child protection assistance dog |publisher=Vachss.com |date=1989-11-12 |access-date=2012-02-02}}</ref>

== Personal life ==
When Vachss was 7 years old, an older boy swung a chain at his right eye. The resulting injuries damaged the eye muscles and resulted in his wearing an [[eyepatch]].<ref>Rahner, Mark [http://www.vachss.com/av_articles/seattle_times_2.html "Vachss' Work Emanates From His Own Cold Rage"] ''[[Seattle Times]]'' (October 15, 2000).

Vachss also has a small blue heart tattooed on his right hand.<ref>Dundas, Zach [http://www.vachss.com/av_articles/willametteweek.html "The Haunted World of Andrew Vachss"] ''[[Willamette Week]]'' (November 17, 1999).

Vachss' wife, Alice, was a sex crimes [[prosecutor]], and she later became Chief of the Special Victims Bureau in [[Queens]], New York. She is the author of the nonfiction book ''Sex Crimes: Ten Years on the Front Lines Prosecuting Rapists and Confronting Their Collaborators'', a [[The New York Times Notable Book of the Year|''New York Times'' Notable Book of the Year]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alicevachss.com |title=Alice Vachss website |publisher=Alicevachss.com |access-date=2012-02-02}}</ref> She has continued her work as Special Prosecutor for Sex Crimes in rural Oregon.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.alicevachss.com/sex-crimes.html|title=Sex Crimes: Then and Now|publisher=alicevachss.com |date=2016-05-01|access-date=2017-07-06}}</ref>
