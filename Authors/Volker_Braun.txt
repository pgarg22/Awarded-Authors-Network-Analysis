'''Volker Braun''' (born 7 May 1939 in [[Dresden]]) is a German writer. His works include ''Provokation für mich'' (''Provocation for me'') – a collection of poems written between 1959 and 1964 and published in 1965, a play, ''Die Kipper'' (''The Dumpers'') (1972; written 1962–1965), and ''Das ungezwungene Leben Kasts'' (''The Unrestrained Life of Kast'') (1972).

== Life ==
After completing his [[Abitur]], Volker Braun worked for a time in construction before going on to study philosophy at [[Leipzig]]. There he occupied himself with the contradictions and hopes of a socialist state. He joined the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED]] in 1960. Nevertheless, he was regarded as critical of the GDR state, and often succeeded in getting his prose and poetry published only through the application of tactical skill.

His work included poetry, plays, novels and short stories.

At first his writings reflected a critical enthusiasm for the building of socialism. From 1965 to 1967, Braun worked as artistic director at the [[Berliner Ensemble]] at the invitation of [[Helene Weigel]]. After the events of the [[Prague Spring]], he became increasingly critical of life and the possibility for reform under [[Socialism]]. After that, he came under more intense scrutiny of the [[Stasi]]. In 1972 Braun began work at the ''Deutsches Theater Berlin'' (German Theatre Berlin). In 1976 he was among those who signed the petition protesting the expatriation of Wolf Biermann.<ref>[http://www.gegen-diktatur.de/beispiel.php?beisp_id=437 ''Proteste von mehr als 90 DDR-Künstlern gegen die Ausbürgerung Wolf Biermanns''], auf: ''gegen-diktatur.de''</ref> From 1979 he was active again in the Berliner Ensemble. He received the [[Lessing Prize of East Germany]] in 1981. and the [[National Prize of East Germany]] in 1988.

In 1982 Braun left the Writers’ Union of the GDR. At that time his works described an increasingly depressing life in the GDR. The actors in his plays moved about with resignation in immovable settings. His ''Hinze-Kunze-Roman'', based on Diderot's ''Jacques le fataliste et son maître'', received approval for publication in 1985. When it appeared it was reviewed as “absurd” and “anarchistic” by the influential critic Annalise Loeffler.<ref>Anneliese Löffler: ''Wenn Inhalt und Form zur Farce gerinnen''. In: ''Neues Deutschland.'' 9. Oktober 1985, S. 4.</ref> Klaus Hoepke, then deputy minister for culture, was disciplined for having granted permission for its publication.<ref>Vgl.

Wiesbaden 1993; Wolfgang Emmerich: ''Kleine Literaturgeschichte der DDR''. Berlin 2000, S. 52.</ref>

In 1988, Braun received the National Prize of the GDR. During the "peaceful revolution" of 1989, he was a supporter of an independent "third way" for the GDR. He was among the first signatories of the appeal "Fuer unser Land."<ref>[http://www.hdg.de/lemo/html/dokumente/DieDeutscheEinheit_aufrufFuerUnserLand/index.html Aufruf vom 26. November 1989 „Für unser Land“ – vollständiger Text mit den Erstunterzeichnern]</ref> After reunification, he became critically engaged in analysing the reasons for the collapse of the GDR. In this connection, he undertook work with the west-Marxist journal, "[[Das Argument]]," edited by [[Wolfgang Fritz Haug]].

In 1986, Braun was awarded the [[Literature Prize of the City of Bremen|Bremer Literature Prize]]. In 1992 he received the [[Schiller Memorial Prize]]. He was awarded a stipend at the [[Villa Massimo]] and was a guest of the University of Wales in 1994. In 1996, he received the [[Deutschen Kritikerpreis]] (German Critic Prize), became a member of the [[Deutsche Akademie für Sprache und Dichtung]], the [[Sächsische Akademie der Künste]] (Saxon Academy of the Arts) and held the post of Poet-lecturer at the [[University of Heidelberg]]. He received the [[Erwin Strittmatter Prize]] in 1998 and the [[Georg Büchner Prize]] in 2000. From 1999 to 2000, he was the [[Brothers Grimm]]-professor at the [[University of Kassel]]. He would be elected Director of the Literature Section of the [[Academy of Arts, Berlin]] in 2006. In 2008, he received the 2007 [[ver.di-Literature Prize]] 2007 for his story, "Das Mittagsmahl" (Lunch).
