== Biography ==

Iwaszkiewicz was born in Kalnyk in [[Kiev Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]] (now [[Vinnytsia Oblast]], [[Ukraine]]). After the death of his father (an accountant), he and his mother lived in [[Warsaw]] in 1902–1904, and then moved back to Kiev Governorate. He graduated from a secondary school in [[Kiev]] in 1912 and enrolled at the Law Faculty of [[Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv|Kiev University]].

In 1914, he travelled in [[Sicily]] and [[North Africa]] with his friend and distant cousin [[Karol Szymanowski]], a composer for whose opera ''[[King Roger]]'' he later provided the libretto.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=[[The Boston Globe]]| access-date= March 11, 2015|date= January 31, 2015|url= https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/music/2015/01/31/glittering-operatic-rarity-king-roger-comes-bso/qywKTbfuoZIn8nNKfi6YtN/story.html | title = Glittering operatic rarity 'King Roger' comes to BSO |first=Jeffrey | last=Gantz}}</ref> After World War I, in October 1918 Iwaszkiewicz came to Warsaw, where he joined a group of young artists associated with the ''Pro Arte et Studio'' magazine. He had his public debut as a poet at the ''Pod Picadorem'' café on 29 November. With [[Julian Tuwim]] and [[Antoni Słonimski]], he founded the ''[[Skamander]]'' group of experimental poets in 1919.<ref name=RRo>Radosław Romaniuk (13 April 2015), [https://histmag.org/Jaroslaw-Iwaszkiewicz-i-poczatki-Skamandra-10892 Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz i początki Skamandra.] ('Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz and the beginnings of Skamander'), Histmag.org.

[[File:Witkacy-Portret Anny i Jarosława Iwaszkiewiczów.jpg|thumb|250px|Portrait of Iwaszkiewicz and his wife Anna by [[Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz]] (1922)]]

He was appointed to be secretary of [[Maciej Rataj]], [[Marshal of the Sejm|marshal]] of the ''[[Sejm]]'' of the [[Second Polish Republic]] and served in that capacity in 1923–1925.<ref name="culture.pl"/> Iwaszkiewicz worked for a magazine called ''Wiadomości Literackie'' ('The Literary News') in 1924–1939; he also published his works in numerous periodicals, including  ''Gazeta Polska'' (1934–1938) and ''Ateneum'' (1938–1939). He was secretary to the Society for the Encouragement of Fine Arts (''Towarzystwo Zachęty Sztuk Pięknych'') and from 1925 a member of the Polish [[PEN International|PEN Club]].<ref name="culture.pl"/> From 1927 with the Foreign Ministry, first appointed the head of the art promotion section of the Press Department and later sent as secretary of the Polish mission to [[Copenhagen]] (1932–1935) and [[Brussels]] (1935–1936).<ref name="culture.pl"/> He was a member of The Trade Union of Polish Writers (''Związek Zawodowy Literatów Polskich'', ZZLP) and in 1939 voted its vice-president.<ref name="culture.pl"/>

During World War II, Iwaszkiewicz participated in the [[Polish Underground State]]'s activities, working in the Department of Education, Science and Culture of the [[Government Delegation for Poland]].<ref name="culture.pl"/> He collaborated with Prof. [[Stanisław Lorentz]] in his efforts to protect and rescue Poland's works of art. Iwaszkiewicz and his wife Anna had extensive contacts within the Jewish-Polish [[intelligentsia]] circles and assisted their former neighbors, friends and acquaintances in a variety of ways during the [[History of Poland (1939–1945)|German occupation of Poland]]. Iwaszkiewicz family's ''Villa Stawisko'' residence served as a hiding place for many Jews and [[Poles]] who faced the threat of being arrested by [[Nazi Germany|Nazi Germans]], especially after the fall of the [[Warsaw Uprising]] in 1944. At one time, more than 40 people were sheltered in the mansion.<ref name="Sprawiedliwi"/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rp.pl/artykul/525046-Milosc-Iwaszkiewiczow-przetrwala-57-lat.html |title=Miłość Iwaszkiewiczów przetrwała 57 lat |trans-title=The love of the Iwaszkiewiczs lasted 57 years|date=20 August 2010|author=Jan Bończa-Szabłowski|publisher=[[Rzeczpospolita]]|access-date=2019-04-11}}</ref> During the war, ''Stawisko'' also functioned as a center of Polish underground literature and art.<ref name="culture.pl"/><ref name=TP/>

[[File:Podkowa Lesna 1.jpg|thumb|250px|''Villa Stawisko'' in [[Podkowa Leśna]] houses the Anna and Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz Museum]]

In 1945–1946, 1947–1949 and 1959–1980, Iwaszkiewicz served as head of the [[Polish Writers' Union]].<ref name="culture.pl"/> In 1945–1949 and 1955–1957 he was literary manager of the [[Polish Theatre in Warsaw]].<ref name="culture.pl"/> From March 1947 to December 1949, he published the ''Nowiny literackie'' ('Literary News') magazine. Beginning in 1956, for many years he was chief editor of the monthly ''Twórczość'' ('Creativity').<ref name="Milosz"/><ref name=Passent/> Vice-president of the Polish PEN Club in 1950–1965.<ref name="culture.pl"/>

Iwaszkiewicz was an organizer of the [[World Congress of Intellectuals in Defense of Peace]] held in [[Wrocław]] in 1948 and a delegate to the [[World Peace Council|World Peace Congress]] in 1950.<ref name="culture.pl"/>

He served as a [[Nonpartisanism|nonpartisan]] member of parliament from 1952 until his death in 1980.<ref name="culture.pl"/> In his last three terms, he was the Senior [[Marshal of the Sejm|Marshal of the ''Sejm'']]. Iwaszkiewicz wrote of his deeply [[socialism|socialist]] convictions, but was ambivalent and privately bitter about the political reality of the [[Polish People's Republic]], within which he officially functioned. Nevertheless, he was greatly impressed by the appreciation note that he received from [[Bolesław Bierut]] on the 40th anniversary of Iwaszkiewicz's literary career. In 1956, he was thrilled by the [[Polish October]] events. After a conversation with [[Edward Ochab]] in 1961, Iwaszkiewicz wrote: "They blame me for not having done anything as a member of the ''Sejm'', but then they want me to be a deputy again".<ref name=Passent/> He continued his lifelong habit of making many foreign trips.<ref name=TP/>

Iwaszkiewicz wrote novels and short stories, poems, dramatic works, essays and columns, and translations from [[French literature|French]], [[English literature|English]], [[Russian literature|Russian]] and [[Danish literature|Danish]] literatures. His major epic novel is ''Sława i Chwała'' ('Fame and Glory') – a panorama of life of Polish [[intelligentsia]] in the first half of the 20th century. In particular, he is highly regarded for his short stories, a genre he developed and modernized. Using changing forms and themes, throughout his career Iwaszkiewicz produced collections of poems of major significance. He wrote plays based on classical motifs and many miscellaneous pieces reflecting his interests and pursuits in areas such as music and theatre, travel, and popularization of culture.<ref name="culture.pl"/>

In 1936, Iwaszkiewicz won the Golden Laurel (Polish: ''Złoty Wawrzyn'') conferred by the [[Polish Academy of Literature]]. He was twice awarded the [[Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland]] (1946 and 1947) and also the [[Order of the Builders of People's Poland]] in 1954. In 1955, he became the recipient of the [[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic]] and the [[Medal of the 10th Anniversary of People's Poland]]. In 1970, he was awarded the [[Lenin Peace Prize]]. In 1974, [[Edward Gierek]] awarded him with the Grand Cross of the [[Order of Polonia Restituta]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.polskieradio.pl/8/195/Artykul/1057150,Jaroslaw-Iwaszkiewicz-%E2%80%93-120-lat-innego-zycia |title=Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz – 120 lat 'innego życia' |trans-title=Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz – 120 years of 'the other life'|publisher=[[Polskie Radio]]|access-date=2019-04-11}}</ref> He received honorary doctorates from the [[University of Warsaw]] in 1971 and the [[Jagiellonian University]] in 1979, as well as numerous other Polish, foreign and international awards and distinctions.<ref name="culture.pl"/> However, Iwaszkiewicz's works were removed in Poland from school recommended readings after the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse of the Soviet Bloc]]. They have since been regaining the recognition of their value and rank.<ref name=Passent>{{cite web|title=Podwójne życie pana Jarosława |trans-title=The double-life of Mr. Jarosław|url=https://www.tygodnikprzeglad.pl/podwojne-zycie-pana-jaroslawa/|publisher=Tygodnik [[Przegląd]]|access-date=24 January 2012|author=Daniel Passent|author-link=Daniel Passent|year=2010}}</ref>

[[Czesław Miłosz]] wrote the following: "Iwaszkiewicz is a great figure and nobody who deals with [[Polish literature]] can omit him. Even if some parts of his huge literary output are excluded, there is enough left, also as a testimony to the three epochs, to secure for him a place higher than that of any of his contemporaries". He concluded, "One is almost inclined to believe that some people are gripped by circumstances meant for them, and that for him the good fortunes, after his impoverished youth, began in the [[interwar period]], to endure also later". For Miłosz could not imagine Iwaszkiewicz as an ''émigré'' personality.<ref name=TP/>

Iwaszkiewicz died on 2 March 1980 and was buried on 5 March at the cemetery in [[Brwinów]] near Warsaw, according to his last wish in a miner's uniform.

==Personal life==

In 1922, Iwaszkiewicz married [[Anna Iwaszkiewicz|Anna Lilpop]] (1897–1979), a writer and translator and daughter of Stanisław Wilhelm Lilpop, a wealthy entrepreneur.<ref name="Newsweek Polska"/> The couple settled in [[Podkowa Leśna]] near Warsaw. In 1928, they moved to a newly built villa that Iwaszkiewicz named ''Stawisko''.<ref name="culture.pl"/> It currently houses a museum devoted to Iwaszkiewicz and his wife. They had two daughters: Maria (1924–2019) and Teresa (1928–2012).<ref name="Sprawiedliwi"/> Iwaszkiewicz was [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] and [[Homoeroticism|homoerotic]]; those themes are present in his poetry and prose works. In his diaries he describes himself as a "[[Homosexuality|homosexual]]"; however, in light of the current understanding of human [[sexual orientation]] and his biography, he can be characterized as a bisexual. Iwaszkiewicz experienced and described a particularly intense relationship with a younger man terminally ill with [[tuberculosis]]; it commenced when the writer was over sixty years old. His wife always "knew of all of his affections".<ref name="Newsweek Polska">{{cite news|url=https://www.newsweek.pl/kultura/milosc-iwaszkiewicza/lrxe55k |title=Miłość Iwaszkiewicza |trans-title=Iwaszkiewicz's love|publisher=[[Newsweek Polska]]|access-date=2019-04-11}}</ref>

In 2012, his great-granddaughter Ludwika Włodek wrote a best-selling biographical book about the life of her great-grandfather, titled ''Pra''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.znak.com.pl/ksiazka/pra-opowiesc-o-rodzinie-iwaszkiewiczow-opowiescpr-ludwika-wlodek-105320 |title=Pra.
