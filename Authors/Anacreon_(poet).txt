'''Anacreon''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|n|æ|k|r|i|ən}}; {{lang-grc-gre|[[wikt:Ἀνακρέων|Ἀνακρέων]] ὁ Τήϊος}}; {{circa|582|485}} BC)<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/22261/Anacreon "Anacreon"]. ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]''.</ref> was a [[Greece|Greek]] [[lyric poetry|lyric]] poet, notable for his drinking songs and erotic poems.  Later Greeks included him in the canonical list of [[Nine Lyric Poets]]. Anacreon wrote all of his poetry in the ancient [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] [[dialect]]. Like all early [[lyric poetry]], it was composed to be sung or recited to the accompaniment of music, usually the [[lyre]]. Anacreon's poetry touched on universal themes of love, infatuation, disappointment, revelry, parties, festivals and the observations of everyday people and life.

== Life ==
[[File:Anacreon - Project Gutenberg eText 12788.png|thumb|18th-century engraving after a bust of Anacreon]]

Anacreon was born in around 582 BC at [[Teos]], an [[Ionia]]n city on the coast of [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]]. The name and identity of his father is a matter of dispute, with different authorities naming four possibilities: Scythianus, Eumelus, Parthenius, or Aristocritus.

It is likely that Anacreon fled into exile with most of his fellow-townsmen who sailed to [[Thrace]] when their homeland was attacked by the Persians. There they founded a colony at [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]], rather than remaining behind to surrender their city to [[Harpagus]], one of [[Cyrus the Great]]'s generals. Cyrus was, at the time (545 BC), besieging the Greek cities of [[Asia Minor]]. Anacreon seems to have taken part in the fighting, in which, by his own admission, he did not distinguish himself.<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Anacreon|volume=1|pages=906-907}}</ref>

From Thrace he traveled to the court of [[Polycrates]] of Samos. He is said to have been a [[tutor]] of Polycrates; that he enjoyed the [[tyrant]]'s confidence is based on [[Herodotus]],<ref>iii.121</ref> who observes that the poet was sitting in the royal chamber when an audience was given to the Persian herald. In return for his favor and protection, Anacreon wrote many complimentary [[ode]]s about his patron. Like his fellow-lyric poet, [[Horace]], who was one of his great admirers, and in many respects a kindred spirit, Anacreon seems to have been made for the society of courts.<ref name="EB1911"/>

John Addison,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=3S8BAAAAMAAJ&pg=PP23&lpg=PP23&dq=Anacreon+five+talents&source=bl&ots=C3ZxB_HuFy&sig=uNlbEzzAkZ3_zLoxV1kwNBofeEU&hl=fr&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwip8aqskJnPAhXIVxoKHUxYAGkQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&q=Anacreon%20five%20talents&f=false Google Books]</ref> writing in 1735, relates a story told by [[Stobaeus]] about Anacreon. Having received a treasure of five gold [[Talent (measurement)|talent]]s from Polycrates, Anacreon could not sleep for two nights in a row. He then returned it to his patron, saying: "However considerable the sum might be, it's not an equal price for the trouble of keeping it."

On the death of Polycrates, [[Hipparchus (son of Peisistratos)|Hipparchus]], who was then in power at [[Athens]] and inherited the literary tastes of his father [[Peisistratus]], sent a special embassy to fetch the popular poet to Athens in a galley of fifty oars. In Athens he became acquainted with the poet [[Simonides of Ceos|Simonides]], and other members of the brilliant circle which had gathered around Hipparchus. When this circle was broken up by the assassination of Hipparchus, Anacreon seems to have returned to his native town of Teos, where, according to a metrical epitaph ascribed to his friend Simonides, he died and was buried.<ref name="EB1911"/>

According to others, before returning to Teos, he accompanied Simonides to the court of Echecrates, a [[Thessaly|Thessalian]] dynast of the house of the [[Aleuadae]]. [[Lucian]] mentions Anacreon amongst his instances of the longevity of eminent men, as having completed eighty-five years. If an anecdote given by [[Pliny the Elder]]<ref>''Nat. Hist.'' vii.7</ref> is correct, he was choked by a grape-stone, but the story has an air of mythical adaptation to the poet's habits, which makes it more likely to be [[apocrypha]]l.<ref name="EB1911"/>

For a long time, Anacreon was popular in Athens, where his statue was to be seen on the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]], together with that of his friend [[Xanthippus]], the father of [[Pericles]].<ref name="Pausanias, Attica xxv.1">Pausanias, ''Attica'' xxv.1</ref> On several coins from Teos he is represented holding a lyre in his hand, sometimes sitting, sometimes standing. A marble statue found in 1835 in the [[Sabines|Sabine]] district, and now in the [[Galleria Borghese]], is said to represent Anacreon.<ref name="EB1911"/>

==Poetry==

===Poetic form and style===
[[Image:Anacreon monte calvo.jpg|right|thumb|Anacreon depicted in the act of singing and playing his [[lyre]].]]
Anacreon wrote all of his poetry in the ancient Ionic [[dialect]]. Like all early [[lyric poetry]], it was composed to be sung or recited to the accompaniment of music, usually the [[lyre]]. Anacreon's verses were primarily in the form of [[monody]] rather than for a [[choir|chorus]].

In keeping with Greek poetic tradition, his poetry relied on the meter for its construction. Metrical poetry is a particularly rhythmic form, deriving its structure from patterns of phonetic features within and between the lines of verse. The phonetic patterning in Anacreon's poetry, like all the Greek poetry of the day, is found in the structured alternation of "long" and "short" syllables. The Ionic dialect also had a tonal aspect to it that lends a natural melodic quality to the recitation.  Anacreon's meters include the [[anacreonteus]].

The Greek language is particularly well suited to this metrical style of poetry but the sound of the verses does not easily transfer to English. As a consequence, translators have historically tended to substitute rhyme, stress rhythms, stanzaic patterning and other devices for the style of the originals, with the primary, sometimes only, connection to the Greek verses being the subject matter. More recent translators have tended to attempt a more spare translation which, though losing the sound of the originals, may be more true to their flavor. A sample of a translation in the English rhyming tradition is included below.

===Themes and subjects of Anacreon's poetry===
Anacreon's poetry touched on universal themes of love, infatuation, disappointment, revelry, parties, festivals, and observations of everyday people and life. It is the subject matter of Anacreon's poetry that helped to keep it familiar and enjoyable to generations of readers and listeners. His widespread popularity inspired countless imitators, which also kept his name alive.

Anacreon had a reputation as a composer of hymns, as well as of those [[bacchanalia]]n and amatory lyrics which are commonly associated with his name. Two short hymns to [[Artemis]] and [[Dionysus]], consisting of eight and eleven lines respectively, stand first amongst his few undisputed remains, as printed by recent editors. But hymns, especially when addressed to such deities as [[Aphrodite]], [[Eros]] and [[Dionysus]], are not so very unlike what we call "Anacreontic" poetry as to make the contrast of style as great as the word might seem to imply. The tone of Anacreon's lyric effusions has probably led to an unjust estimate, by both ancients and moderns, of the poet's personal character. The "triple worship" of the [[Muse]]s, Wine and Love, ascribed to him as his religion in an old Greek epigram,<ref>''Greek Anthology.'' iii.25, 51</ref> may have been as purely professional in the two last cases as in the first, and his private character on such points was probably neither much better nor worse than that of his contemporaries. [[Athenaeus]] remarks acutely that he seems at least to have been sober when he wrote. His character was an issue, because, according to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], his statue on the Acropolis of Athens depicts him as drunk.<ref name="Pausanias, Attica xxv.1"/> He himself strongly repudiates, as Horace does, the brutal characteristics of intoxication as fit only for [[barbarian]]s and [[Scythians]].<ref name="EB1911"/><ref>Fr. 64</ref>

Of the five books of lyrical pieces by Anacreon which the ''[[Suda]]'' and [[Athenaeus]] mention as extant in their time, only the merest fragments exist today, collected from the citations of later writers.<ref name="EB1911"/>

A collection of poems by numerous, anonymous imitators was long believed to be the works of Anacreon himself.  Known as the ''[[Anacreontea]]'', it was preserved in a 10th-century [[manuscript]] which also included the ''[[Palatine Anthology]]''. The poems themselves appear to have been composed over a long period of time, from the time of Alexander the Great until the time that paganism gave way in the Roman Empire.  They reflect the light-hearted elegance of much of Anacreon's genuine works although they were not written in the same Ionic Greek dialect that Anacreon used.  They also display literary references and styles more common to the time of their actual composition.

===A translated poem===
Typical of most efforts at translation, this 19th-century one by [[Walter Headlam]] takes the subject matter of Anacreon's verses and works them into a rhyming style typical of the English poetry written in Headlam's day. The subject of the poem still remains: Anacreon complaining that a young woman, whom he compares to a Thracian filly, does not recognize his amatory skills.
{{quote|<poem>
Ah tell me why you turn and fly,
My little Thracian filly shy?
            Why turn askance
            That cruel glance,
And think that such a dunce am I?

O I am blest with ample wit
To fix the bridle and the bit,
            And make thee bend
            Each turning-end
In harness all the course of it.

But now 'tis yet the meadow free
And frisking it with merry glee;
            The master yet
            Has not been met
To mount the car and manage thee.<ref>{{cite book |last=Headlam |first=Walter George |author-link=Walter Headlam |title=A Book of Greek Verse |date=1907 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=33 |url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgreekvers00head/page/32}}</ref></poem>}}
