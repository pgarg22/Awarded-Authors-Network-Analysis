==Early life==
Isabel Cheix was one of eight children born to [[Don (honorific)|Don]] Santiago Cheix and [[Doña]] María Amparo Martínez. Her father was a well-educated, wealthy mining engineer, who moved between Almería, Málaga and Seville. She was educated in [[Almería]], but moved at an early age to Seville, where she spent her life and where she wrote, at age nine, her first poem ''Al Lucero de la Mañana (To the Morning Star)''.<ref name="virtuallibrary"/> Her three short dramatic pieces called ''Violeta, Magdalena'' and ''La Tia Lechuza'' were written around 1896 but did not reach the stage during her lifetime.<ref name="mcnbios">{{Citation|url=http://www.mcnbiografias.com/app-bio/do/show?key=cheix-martinez-isabel|title=MCN Biographies|language=Spanish|work=Cheix Martínez, Isabel|accessdate=15 May 2012}}</ref>

When Cheix was 19 years old her mother died and she took upon herself the task of caring for her seven siblings, all younger than her. She had to suspend her literary activities and dedicate herself to the care of her family and home. She spent her life between domestic tasks and what she called her “childhood hobby”.<ref name="virtuallibrary"/> Five years later her father died. To earn money she started painting landscapes, a skill learned in her educative years, and she was able to sell these and maintain a reasonable lifestyle for the family.<ref name="virtuallibrary"/>

==Literary life==
She acquired prestige in Seville among the intellectuals of that time and was permitted to collaborate in journalistic work for ''La Semana Católica, Revista Compostelana, La Moda Elegante, Asta Regia'' ([[Jaén, Spain|Jaén]]), ''El Folletín'' (Málaga), and ''Sevilla Mariana.''<ref name="virtuallibrary"/> She wrote “I only understand happiness in the practice of virtue”.<ref name="mcnbios"/>

Cheix started publishing her poems in the local press in Málaga and took part in different literary competitions trying all kinds of genres. Lyric poetry was her preferred genre but this was combined with poems in newer themes of patriotism, often together with the condemnation of war and the deep desire for peace. She also carefully developed a religious theme and would be the only one of her generation to attempt the biographical genre, specifically, [[hagiography]].

The first work that she entered in a competition was ''El Caballero de Napoles,'' submitted to the Academia Bibliográfica Mariana in [[Lleida]] in 1868. It won first prize. This result encouraged her and she went on to win 9 more prizes and awards in that completion. Cheix also competed in the Academia Sevillana de Buenas Letras and won 5 times, she also won literary awards in [[Murcia]], Málaga, [[Vitoria-Gasteiz|Vitoria]] and [[Manila]] with various poems, articles and novels.<ref name = "virtuallibrary"/>

In 1882 Cheix entered a competition sponsored by the Escuela Normal de Buenas Letras in Seville, her theme was ''“Should women be educated?”.'' The article won a gold and pearl medal. In the same year she won another gold medal in a literary competition in [[Manila]] with an article about [[Teresa of Ávila|Saint Theresa]]. Cheix went on to develop her article into a book about the life of St Theresa called ''La Reformadora del Carmelo.''<ref name="virtuallibrary"/> She died in Seville, Spain, aged 60.
