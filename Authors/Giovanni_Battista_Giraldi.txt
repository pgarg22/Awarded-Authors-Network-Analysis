'''Giovanni Battista Giraldi''' (12 November<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=x0KZEYvVMOgC&pg=PT262&dq= ''The Bibliophile Dictionary: A Biographical Record of the Great Authors''], The Minerva Group, Inc., 2003: "Giraldi, Giovanni Battista"</ref> 1504 – 30 December 1573) was an Italian [[novelist]] and [[poet]]. He appended the nickname '''Cinthio''' to his name and is commonly referred to by that name (which is also rendered as '''Cynthius''', '''Cintio''' or, in Italian, '''Cinzio''').

==Biography==
Born at [[Ferrara]], he was educated at the university there, and in 1525 became its professor of [[natural philosophy]]. Twelve years afterwards, he succeeded [[Celio Calcagnini]] in the chair of [[belles-lettres]].

Between 1542 and 1560 he was a private secretary, first to [[Ercole II]] and afterwards to [[Alfonso II d'Este]]; but having, in connection with a literary quarrel, lost the favour of his patron, he moved to [[Mondovì]], where he remained as a teacher of literature until 1568. Subsequently, on the invitation of the senate of [[Milan]], he occupied the chair of [[rhetoric]] at [[Pavia]] until 1573, when, in search of health, he returned to Ferrara, where he later died.

Besides an [[Epic poetry|epic]] entitled ''Ercole'' (1557), in twenty-six [[canto]]s, Cinthio wrote nine [[tragedy|tragedies]], the best known of which, ''[[Orbecche]]'', was produced in 1541. The bloodthirsty nature of the play, and its style, are, in the opinion of many of its critics, almost redeemed by occasional bursts of genuine and impassioned poetry.

His literary work was ideologically influenced by the [[Catholic Reformation]]. In the theatrical works there appears a vein of experimentation that anticipates some typical elements of taste of the modern European theatre, for example the [[Elizabethan theatre]] and [[baroque]] styles, where psychological violence and horror are used in function and dramatic action structured in real time.

Among the prose works of Cinthio is the ''Hecatommithi'' or ''Gli Ecatommiti'', a collection of tales told somewhat after the manner of [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]], but still more closely resembling the novels of Cinthio's contemporary, [[Matteo Bandello]]. Something may be said in favour of their professed claim to represent a higher standard of morality. Originally published at [[Mondovì]] in 1565, they were frequently reprinted in Italy, while a French translation appeared in 1583 and one in Spanish, with 20 of the stories, in 1590. They have a peculiar interest to students of [[English literature]], for providing the plots of ''[[Measure for Measure]]'' and ''[[Othello]]''. That of the latter, which is to be found in the ''Hecatommithi'', was almost certainly read by [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] in the original Italian;<ref>Michael Neill, ed. ''Othello'' (Oxford University Press), 2006, p. 21–2.</ref> while that of the former is probably to be traced to [[George Whetstone]]'s ''Promos and Cassandra'' (1578), an adaptation of Cinthio's story, and to his ''Heptamerone'' (1582), which contains a direct English translation. It has also been noted that the story of [[Othello]] and ''Un Capitano Moro'' resemble the earlier tale of ''[[wikisource:The Tale of the Three Apples|The Tale of the Three Apples]]'', a story from ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''.<ref>{{citation|last=Young|first=John G., M.D.|title=Essay: What Is Creativity?|journal=Adventures in Creativity: Multimedia Magazine|volume=1|issue=2|url=http://www.adventuresincreativity.net/2mag1.html|access-date=2008-10-17|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820111333/http://www.adventuresincreativity.net/2mag1.html|archive-date=2008-08-20}}</ref> To Cinthio also must be attributed the plot of [[Beaumont and Fletcher]]'s ''Custom of the Country''.
