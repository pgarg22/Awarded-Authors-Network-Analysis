==Life and career==
{{More citations needed section|date=January 2017}}

===Early years===
Ferber was born August 15, 1885, in [[Kalamazoo, Michigan]], to a [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-born [[Jew]]ish storekeeper, Jacob Charles Ferber, and his [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]-born wife, Julia (Neumann) Ferber, who was of German Jewish descent.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kinQAwAAQBAJ&q=%22Her+father%2C+Jacob+Charles+Ferber%2C+was+a+Hungarian+Jew%2C+and+her+mother%2C%22&pg=PA191|title=Looking Backward: True Stories from Chicago's Jewish Past|isbn=9780897338271|last1=Roth|first1=Walter|date=August 2005}}</ref> She moved often due to her father's business failures, likely caused by his early blindness.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/ferber-edna|title=Edna Ferber {{!}} Jewish Women's Archive|website=jwa.org|access-date=February 15, 2019}}</ref> After living in [[Chicago, Illinois]], she moved to [[Ottumwa, Iowa]] with her parents and older sister, Fannie, where they resided for 7 years (age 5 to 12 for Ferber). In Ottumwa, Ferber and her family faced brutal [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]], including adult males verbally abusing, mocking and spitting on her every day when she brought lunch to her father, often mocking her in a [[Yiddish]] accent.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/edna-ferber|title=Edna Ferber|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org|access-date=September 27, 2019}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nndb.com/people/391/000073172/|title=Edna Ferber|website=www.nndb.com|access-date=September 27, 2019}}</ref> At the age of 12, Ferber and her family moved to [[Appleton, Wisconsin]], where she graduated from high school and briefly attended [[Lawrence University]].

===Career===
Initially going to study acting, Ferber abandoned these plans to help support her family at age 17. Forbidden to study elocution and on the spur of the moment, Ferber ended her higher education and dropped out of Lawrence, subsequently being hired at the ''[[The Post-Crescent|Appleton Daily Crescent]]'' and eventually the ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|Milwaukee Journal]].''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/ferber-edna|title=Edna Ferber {{!}} Jewish Women's Archive|website=jwa.org|access-date=March 10, 2020}}</ref> She covered the [[1920 Republican National Convention]] and [[1920 Democratic National Convention]] for the [[United Press International|United Press Association]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://americanliterature.com/author/edna-ferber|title=Edna Ferber|website=americanliterature.com|access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref> during her period as a reporter.

When Ferber was recovering from [[anemia]],<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/819/so-big|title=So Big|date=May 2, 2007|website=Tablet Magazine|language=en|access-date=September 27, 2019}}</ref> her first short stories were compiled and published along with her first novel, ''Dawn O'Hara, The Girl Who Laughed'', in 1911.

In 1925, she won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for her book ''[[So Big (novel)|So Big]]''. Ferber initially believed her draft of what would become ''So Big'' lacked a plot, glorified failure, and had a subtle theme that could easily be overlooked. When she sent the book to her usual publisher, [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], she was surprised to learn that he strongly enjoyed the novel. This was reflected by the several hundreds of thousands of copies of the novel sold to the public.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Smyth|first=J. E.|title=Edna Ferber's Hollywood: American fictions of gender, race, and history|date=2010|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=9780292719842|edition=1st|location=Austin|oclc=318870278}}</ref>  Following the award, the novel was made into a [[silent film]] starring [[Colleen Moore]] that [[So Big (1924 film)|same year]]. An early [[talkie]] movie remake followed in [[So Big (1932 film)|1932]], starring [[Barbara Stanwyck]] and [[George Brent]], with [[Bette Davis]] in a supporting role. A [[So Big (1953 film)|1953 version]] of ''So Big'' starring [[Jane Wyman]] is the most popular version to modern audiences.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}}

Riding the popularity of ''So Big'', Ferber's next novel, ''[[Show Boat (novel)|Show Boat]]'', was just as successful. Shortly after its release, composer [[Jerome Kern]] proposed turning it into a [[Show Boat|musical]]. Ferber was shocked, thinking it would be transformed into a typical light entertainment of the 1920s. It was not until Kern explained that he and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] wanted to create a different type of [[Musical theater|musical]] that Ferber granted him the rights and it premiered on [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] in 1927, and has been [[Revival (theatre)|revived]] 8 times.

Her 1952 novel, ''Giant'', became the basis of the 1956 movie, starring [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[James Dean]] and [[Rock Hudson]].

=== Death ===
Ferber died at her home in [[New York City]], of [[stomach cancer]],<ref>{{cite book|author=R. Baird Shuman|title=Great American Writers: Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YBIvc_e_YwwC&pg=PA503|year=2002|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-7240-7|pages=503}}</ref> at the age of 82. Ferber left her estate to her remaining female relatives, but gave the American government permission to spread her literary work to encourage and inspire future female authors.<ref name=":0" />

== Personal life ==
Ferber never married, had no children, and is not known to have engaged in a romance or sexual relationship.<ref>Ferber has been rumored to be a [[lesbian]] in several undocumented sources.
Professor John Unsworth makes an unsupported claim in John Sutherland (2007) ''Bestsellers: A Very Short Introduction'' Oxford University Press: 53. Haggerty and Zimmerman imply she was gay because of her visits to [[Provincetown]] in the early 20th century (Haggerty and Zimmerman (2000), ''Lesbian Histories and Cultures: An Encyclopedia'', Taylor and Francis, p. 610).
Porter (Porter, Darwin (2004) ''Katherine the Great'', Blood Moon Productions, Ltd, p. 204) comments in passing that Ferber was a lesbian, but offers no support. Burrough (Burrough, Brian (2010) ''The Big Rich: The Rise and Fall of the Greatest Texas Oil Fortunes'', Penguin) also remarks in passing that Ferber was gay, citing the biography written by Julie Goldsmith Gilbert (Ferber's great niece, see bibliography).  Gilbert, however, makes no mention of lesbian relationships.</ref>
In her early novel ''Dawn O'Hara'', the title character's aunt even remarks, "Being an old maid was a great deal like death by drowning – a really delightful sensation when you ceased struggling." Ferber did take a maternal interest in the career of her niece [[Janet Fox]], an actress who performed in the original Broadway casts of Ferber's plays ''[[Dinner at Eight (play)|Dinner at Eight]]'' (1932) and ''Stage Door'' (1936).

Ferber was known for being outspoken and having a quick wit. On one occasion, she led other Jewish guests in leaving a house party after learning the host was anti-Semitic.<ref name=":0" /> Once, after a man joked about how her suit made her resemble a man, she replied, "So does yours."<ref name=":1" />

The quality of her work was so high that many sexist literary critics believed a man to have written her narratives under a [[pseudonym]] of a woman.<ref name=":0" />

=== Importance of Jewish identity ===
Starting in 1922, Ferber began to visit Europe once or twice annually for thirteen or fourteen years.<ref name=":3">{{cite journal|last1=Shapiro|first1=Ann R.|date=2002|title=Edna Ferber, Jewish American Feminist|journal=Shofar|volume=20|issue=2|pages=52–60|doi=10.1353/sho.2001.0159|s2cid=143198251}}</ref> During this time and unlike most Americans, she became troubled by the rise of the [[Nazi Party]] and its spreading of the [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] prejudice she had faced in her childhood. She commented on this saying, "It was a fearful thing to see a continent - a civilization - crumbling before one's eyes. It was a rapid and seemingly inevitable process to which no one paid any particular attention."<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ferber|first=Edna|title=A Peculiar Treasure|publisher=Doubleday|year=1938|pages=267}}</ref> Her fears greatly influenced her work, which often featured themes of racial and cultural discrimination. Her 1938 autobiography, ''[[A Peculiar Treasure]]'', originally included a spiteful dedication to [[Adolf Hitler]] which stated: <blockquote>"To Adolf Hitler, who has made me a better Jew and a more understanding human being, as he has of millions of other Jews, this book is dedicated in loathing and contempt."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/ferber-edna|title=Edna Ferber {{!}} Jewish Women's Archive|website=jwa.org|access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref></blockquote>While this was changed by the time of the book's publication, it still alluded to the Nazi threat.<ref name=":3" /> She frequently mentions Jewish success in her book, alluding to and wanting to show not just that Jewish success, but Jews being able to utilize that and prevail.<ref name=":3" />

=== Algonquin Round Table ===
Ferber was a member of the [[Algonquin Round Table]], a group of wits who met for lunch every day at the [[Algonquin Hotel]] in New York. Ferber and another member of the Round Table, [[Alexander Woollcott]], were long-time enemies, their antipathy lasting until Woollcott's death in 1943, although [[Howard Teichmann]] states in his biography of Woollcott that their feud was due to a misunderstanding. According to Teichmann, Ferber once described Woollcott as "a New Jersey [[Nero]] who has mistaken his [[pinafore]] for a [[toga]]".

Ferber collaborated with Round Table member [[George S. Kaufman]] on several plays presented on Broadway: ''Minick'' (1924), ''[[The Royal Family (play)|The Royal Family]]'' (1927), ''[[Dinner at Eight (play)|Dinner At Eight]]'' (1932), ''[[The Land Is Bright]]'' (1941), ''[[Stage Door]]'' (1936), and ''Bravo!'' (1948).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bard.org/study-guides/about-the-playwright-the-royal-family|title=About the Playwright: The Royal Family – The Kaufman-Ferber Partnership|work=Utah Shakespeare Festival|publisher=The Professional Theater at Southern Utah University|access-date=February 8, 2017}}</ref>

===Political views===
In a poll carried out by the ''[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review of Literature]]'', asking American writers which presidential candidate they supported in the [[1940 United States presidential election|1940 election]], Ferber was among the writers who endorsed [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].<ref>''"Among those who have stated they will vote for President Roosevelt are Edna Ferber..."'' "Editorial: Presidential Poll", ''Saturday Review of Literature''. November 2, 1940 (p.8).</ref>

== Characteristics of works ==
Ferber's novels generally featured strong female [[protagonist]]s, along with a rich and diverse collection of supporting characters. She usually highlighted at least one strong secondary character who faced discrimination, ethnic or otherwise.

Ferber's works often concerned small subsets of American culture, and sometimes took place in exotic locations she had visited but was not intimately familiar with, like [[Texas]] or [[Alaska]]. She thus helped to highlight the diversity of American culture to those who did not have the opportunity to experience it. Some novels are set in places she hadn't visited.
