'''George Turberville''', or '''Turbervile''' (about 1540 – before 1597) was an [[England|English]] poet.

==Life==
He was the second son of Henry Turberville of [[Winterborne Whitechurch]], [[Dorset]],<ref>[https://archive.org/details/visitationofdors00harvuoft] The Visitation of Dorset 1565, page 41.</ref> and nephew of [[James Turberville]], Bishop of Exeter. The Turbervilles were an old Dorsetshire family, the inspiration for the d'Urbervilles of [[Thomas Hardy]]'s novel, ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Turberville became a scholar of [[Winchester College]] in 1554, and in 1561 was made a fellow of [[New College, Oxford]]. In 1562 he began to study law in [[London]], and gained a reputation, according to [[Anthony à Wood]], as a poet and man of affairs. He accompanied [[Thomas Randolph (diplomat)|Thomas Randolph]] on a special mission to [[Moscow]] to the court of [[Ivan the Terrible]] in 1568. Of his ''Poems describing the Places and Manners of the Country and People of Russia'' mentioned by Wood, only three metrical letters describing his adventures survive, and these were reprinted in ''Hakluyt's Voyages'' (1589).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

His ''Epitaphs, Epigrams, Songs and Sonnets'' appeared "newly corrected with additions" in 1567. In the same year he published translations of the ''Heroycall Epistles of [[Ovid]]'', and of the ''Eglogs of Mantuan'' (Gianbattista Spagnuoli, also known as [[Mantuanus]]), and in 1568 ''A Plaine Path to Perfect Vertue from [[Dominicus Mancinus]]''. ''The Book of Falconry or Hawking'' and ''the Noble Art of Venerie''<ref>[https://archive.org/details/turbervilesbook00turbgoog Archive.org]</ref> (printed together in 1575) are sometimes both assigned to Turberville though the second of these is a translation by [[George Gascoigne]] from the French work ''La Venerie'' (1561) by Jacques du Fouilloux.<ref>[http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~wulfric/rentexte/fouillou/fou_html.htm Chass.utoronto.ca]</ref> The title page of his ''Tragical Tales'' (1587), which are translations from [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]] and [[Matteo Bandello|Bandello]], says that the book was written at the time of the author's raging alcoholism and opiate abuse. Wood says he was living and in high esteem in 1594.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
