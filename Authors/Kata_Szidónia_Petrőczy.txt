'''Kata Szidónia Petrőczy''' (1659–1708) was a Hungarian writer and poet. She is regarded as the first female writer of the [[Baroque]] period in Hungary and its foremost representative of Baroque prose.

Kata Szidónia was the daughter of baron [[Stephen Petrőczy]] and Elisabeth Thököly and cousin of prince [[Imre Thököly]] of Transylvania. Her family was Protestant. After her father participated in 1670 in a rebellion against Habsburg, they lived in exile in Poland for a while. She married [[Petrovinai Pekry Lőrinc]] in 1681, and became the grandmother of writer [[Polixénia Daniel]] (1720–1776). The couple were deeply involved in the political life of Hungary and Transylvania. Her poems were published in 1874.
