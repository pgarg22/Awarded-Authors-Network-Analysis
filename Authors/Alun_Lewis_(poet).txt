== Life and work ==
Alun Lewis, was born on 1 July 1915 at [[Cwmaman]], near [[Aberdare]] in the [[Cynon Valley]] of the [[South Wales Coalfield]]s. His parents, Thomas John and Gwladys Lewis,<ref name=cwgc>[https://www.cwgc.org/find-records/find-war-dead/casualty-details/2086909/ALUN%20LEWIS/] CWGC casualty record.</ref> were school teachers at Llanwern; and he had a younger sister, Mair and two brothers. By the time he won a scholarship to attend [[Cowbridge Grammar School]], he was already interested in writing. He went on to study at [[Aberystwyth University]] and the [[University of Manchester]]. Although he was born in South Wales, he wrote in English only.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alun-Lewis|title=Alun Lewis &#124; Welsh poet|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=6 July 2020}}</ref>

Lewis was unsuccessful as a journalist and instead earned his living as a supply teacher. He met the poet [[Lynette Roberts]] (whose poem "Llanybri" is an invitation to him to visit her home), even though she was married to another poet, [[Keidrych Rhys]].  In 1939, Lewis met Gweno Meverid Ellis,<ref name=cwgc/> a teacher, whom he married on 5 July 1941.

After the outbreak of [[World War II|the Second World War]] Lewis first joined the [[British Army]]'s [[Royal Engineers]] as a Private because he was a [[pacifist]], but still wanted to fight [[fascism]]. However, he then inexplicably sought and gained a commission in an infantry battalion. In 1941 he collaborated with artists [[John Petts (artist)|John Petts]] and [[Brenda Chamberlain (artist)|Brenda Chamberlain]] on the "Caseg broadsheets". His first published book was the collection poetry ''Raider's Dawn and other poems'' (1942), which was followed up by a volume of short stories, ''The Last Inspection'' (1942). In 1942 he was sent to India with the 6th battalion [[South Wales Borderers]].<ref name=cwgc/>

Lewis' poems about his war experiences have been described as showing "his brooding over his army experiences and trying to catch and hold some vision that would illuminate its desolation with meaning" (see Ian Hamilton "Alun Lewis Selected Poetry and Prose)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ianhamilton.org/writing/anthologies.html|title=Ian Hamilton Website: Anthologies Edited by Ian Hamilton|website=ianhamilton.org|access-date=6 July 2020}}</ref>

Lewis died on 5 March 1944 during the [[Burma campaign]] against the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. He was found shot in the head, after shaving and washing, near the officers' latrines, with his revolver in his hand, and died from his wound six hours later. Despite it being a case of suicide, a court of inquiry charitably concluded that he had tripped and that the shooting was an accident.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/S/soldier_poets/biog_lewis.html |title= Alun Lewis|access-date=7 January 2008|publisher=Channel 4| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071221152832/http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/S/soldier_poets/biog_lewis.html| archive-date= 21 December 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> He is buried at [[Taukkyan War Cemetery]].<ref name=cwgc/>

His second book of poems, ''Ha! Ha! Among the Trumpets. Poems in Transit'', was published in 1945, and his ''Letters from India'' in 1946. Several collections of his poems, letters and stories have been published subsequently.
