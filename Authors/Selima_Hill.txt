==Critique==
Poet Fiona Sampson says of her work,
<blockquote>"Selima Hill's 1984 collection ''Saying Hello at the Station'' introduced arguably the most distinctive truth teller to emerge in British poetry since [[Sylvia Plath]]. In the quarter-century since that debut, her voice has deepened and strengthened as its subject matter has widened from bereavement and life in a psychiatric unit to more general difficulties with men, family relationships, and the business of living. The simultaneous publication of Hill's new collection ''The Hat'', and a ''Selected Poems, Gloria'', is the perfect moment to rediscover this inimitably exhilarating poet".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jul/12/saturdayreviewsfeatres.guardianreview25| title=Truth and dare| work=The Guardian| author=Fiona Sampson| date=12 July 2008 }}</ref></blockquote>
