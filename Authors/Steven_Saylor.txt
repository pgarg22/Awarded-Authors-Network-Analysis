'''Steven Saylor''' (born March 23, 1956) is an American author of historical novels. He is a graduate of the [[University of Texas at Austin]], where he studied history and [[classics]].

Saylor's best-known work is his ''[[Roma Sub Rosa]]''  [[historical mystery]] series, set in ancient Rome. The novels' hero is a detective named [[Gordianus the Finder]], active during the time of [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]], [[Cicero]], [[Julius Caesar]], and [[Cleopatra VII of Egypt|Cleopatra]]. Outside this crime novel series, Saylor has also written three epic-length historical novels about the city of Rome, ''[[Roma (2007 novel)|Roma]]'', ''[[Empire (Saylor novel)|Empire]]'', and  ''[[Dominus (Saylor novel)|Dominus]]''. His work has been published in 21 languages.

Saylor has also written two novels set in Texas. ''A Twist at the End'', featuring [[O. Henry]], is set in Austin in the 1880s and based on real-life serial murders and trials (the case of the so-called [[Servant Girl Annihilator]]). ''Have You Seen Dawn?'' is a contemporary thriller set in a fictional Texas town, Amethyst, based on Saylor's hometown, [[Goldthwaite, Texas]].

Saylor contributed autobiographical essays to three anthologies of gay writing edited by [[John Preston (author)|John Preston]], ''Hometowns'', ''A Member of the Family'', and ''Friends and Lovers'', and prior to his novel-writing career he published gay [[erotic fiction]] under the pen name '''Aaron Travis'''.

Saylor has lived with Richard Solomon since 1976; they registered as [[domestic partnership|domestic partners]] in San Francisco in 1991 and later dissolved that partnership in order to legally marry in October 2008. The couple split their time between properties in [[Berkeley, California]], and [[Austin, Texas]].<ref name="glbtq">{{cite web |last=Rapp |first=Linda |title=Saylor, Steven |website=[[glbtq.com]] |year=2005 |url=http://www.glbtqarchive.com/literature/saylor_s_L.pdf}}</ref>
