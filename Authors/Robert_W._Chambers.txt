'''Robert William Chambers''' (May 26, 1865 – December 16, 1933) was an American artist and fiction writer, best known for his book of short stories titled ''[[The King in Yellow]]'', published in 1895.

==Life==
Chambers was born in [[Brooklyn]], New York, to William P. Chambers (1827–1911), a corporate and bankruptcy lawyer, and Caroline Smith Boughton (1842–1913). His parents met when his mother was twelve years old and William P. was interning with her father, Joseph Boughton, a prominent corporate lawyer. Eventually the two formed the law firm of Chambers and Boughton which continued to prosper even after Joseph's death in 1861. Robert Chambers's great-grandfather, William Chambers (birth unknown), a lieutenant in the British [[Royal Navy]], was married to Amelia Saunders (1765–1822), a great granddaughter of [[Tobias Saunders]] of Westerly, Rhode Island. The couple moved from Westerly to Greenfield, Massachusetts and then to Galway, New York, where their son, also William Chambers (1798–1874), was born. The second William graduated from [[Union College]] at the age of 18, and then went to a college in Boston, where he studied medicine. Upon graduating, he and his wife, Eliza P. Allen (1793–1880), a direct descendant of [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]],<ref name=":0" /> the founder of Providence, Rhode Island, were among the first settlers of Broadalbin, New York. His brother was the architect [[Walter B. Chambers|Walter Boughton Chambers]].

Chambers was first educated at the [[Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute]], and then entered the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students' League]] at around the age of twenty, where the artist [[Charles Dana Gibson]] was a fellow student. Chambers studied in Paris at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] and the [[Académie Julian]] from 1886 to 1893, and his work was displayed at the [[Paris Salon|Salon]] as early as 1889. On his return to New York, he succeeded in selling his illustrations to ''Life'', ''[[Truth (magazine)|Truth]]'', and ''Vogue'' magazines. Then, for reasons unclear, he devoted his time to writing, producing his first novel, ''[[In the Quarter]]'', written in 1887 in Munich. His most famous, and perhaps most meritorious, effort is ''[[The King in Yellow]]'', a collection of Art Nouveau short stories published in 1895. This included several famous [[weird tale|weird]] short stories which are connected by the theme of a fictitious drama of the same title, which drives those who read it insane.<ref name="survey">[[Brian Stableford]], "The King in Yellow" in Frank N. Magill, ed. ''Survey of Modern Fantasy Literature'', Vol 2. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Salem Press, Inc., 1983. {{ISBN|0893564508}} (pp. 844–847).</ref> [[E. F. Bleiler]] described ''The King in Yellow'' as one of the most important works of American supernatural fiction.<ref>Quoted in "Chambers, Robert W(illiam)" by [[T.E.D. Klein]], in [[Jack Sullivan (literary scholar)|Jack Sullivan]]. ''The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural'', Penguin/Viking, New York. 1986 {{ISBN|0670809020}}, pp. 74-76</ref> It was also strongly admired by [[H. P. Lovecraft]] and his circle.

Chambers returned to the weird genre in his later short story collections ''[[The Maker of Moons]]'', ''[[The Mystery of Choice]]'' and ''[[The Tree of Heaven]]'', but none earned him as much success as ''The King in Yellow''. Some of Chambers's work contains elements of science fiction, such as ''In Search of the Unknown'' and ''Police!!!'', about a [[zoologist]] who encounters monsters.<ref>Bleiler, Everett Franklin and [[Richard Bleiler|Bleiler, Richard]]. ''Science-Fiction: The Early Years''. Kent State University Press, 1990. {{ISBN|0873384164}}. pp. 129-132.</ref>

Chambers's main work of historical fiction was a trilogy of novels set during the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. These novels were ''The Red Republic'' (1895, centring on the [[Paris Commune]]), ''Lorraine'' (1898), and ''Ashes of Empire'' (1898).<ref>Albert Boime, "Olin Levi Warner's Defense of the Paris Commune", ''Archives of American Art Journal'', Vol. 29, No. 3/4 (1989), (pp. 4, 13).</ref><ref name="jn">Nield, Jonathan (1925), ''A Guide to the Best Historical Novels and Tales''. G. P. Putnam's Sons, (pp. 91,114)</ref>  Chambers also wrote ''Cardigan'' (1901), a historical novel set at the outbreak of the [[American Revolution]].<ref name="jn" /> Chambers later turned to writing [[romance novel|romantic fiction]] to earn a living. According to some estimates, Chambers had one of the most successful literary careers of his period, his later novels selling well and a handful achieving best-seller status. Many of his works were also serialised in magazines.

His novel ''The Man They Hanged'' was about [[William Kidd|Captain Kidd]], and argued that Kidd was not a pirate but had been made a scapegoat by the British government.<ref name=":0" />

During World War I, Chambers wrote war adventure novels and war stories, some of which showed a strong return to his old weird style, such as "Marooned" in ''Barbarians'' (1917). After 1924 he devoted himself solely to writing historical fiction.

Chambers for several years made [[Broadalbin (village), New York|Broadalbin, New York]], his summer home. Some of his novels touch upon colonial life in Broadalbin and Johnstown.

On July 12, 1898, he married Elsa (Elsie) Vaughn Moller (1872–1939). They had a son, Robert Edward Stuart Chambers (1899–1955) (who sometimes used the name Robert Husted Chambers).

Robert W. Chambers died on December 16, 1933, after having undergone intestinal surgery three days earlier.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|title = Robert Chambers, Novelist, Is Dead|date = 17 December 1933|work = New York Times|page = 36}}</ref>

==Criticism and legacy==
[[H. P. Lovecraft]] said of Chambers in a letter to [[Clark Ashton Smith]]:

{{bquote|Chambers is like [[Rupert Hughes]] and a few other fallen Titans – equipped with the right brains and education but wholly out of the habit of using them.<ref>Lovecraft, ''Selected Letters'' vol. 2, ed. August Derleth and Donald Wandrei (Arkham House, 1968), p. 148.</ref>}}

Despite Chambers's effective later abandonment of the weird supernatural tale, these early works are all that remained in print through most of the twentieth century, thanks to Lovecraft's inclusion of them in the critical study "[[Supernatural Horror in Literature]]".

[[Frederic Taber Cooper]] commented:

{{bquote|So much of Mr Chambers's work exasperates, because we feel that he might so easily have made it better."<ref>Cooper, ''Some American Story Tellers'' (Henry Holt, 1911), p.81. Quoted in Joshi, ''The Evolution of the Weird Tale'', p.18.</ref>}}

Critical studies of Chambers's horror and fantasy work include Lee Weinstein's essay in ''Supernatural Fiction Writers'',<ref>Lee Weinstein, "Robert W. Chambers in, E.F. Bleiler, ed. ''Supernatural Fiction Writers''. New York: Scribner's, 1985. (pp.739–746). {{ISBN|0-684-17808-7}}</ref> Brian Stableford's essay in the 
''St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost and Gothic Writers''<ref>[[Brian Stableford]], "Chambers, Robert W(illiam)" in [[David Pringle]], ed., ''St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost & Gothic Writers'' (London: St. James Press, 1998) {{ISBN|1558622063}} (pp. 130–2).</ref> and a chapter in [[S.T. Joshi]]'s book ''The Evolution of the Weird Tale'' (2004).

Chambers's novel ''The Tracer of Lost Persons'' was adapted into a long-running (1937–54) radio crime drama, ''[[Mr. Keen, Tracer of Lost Persons]]'', by soap opera producers [[Frank Hummert|Frank]] and [[Anne Hummert]].<ref>{{cite book| last =Cox| first =Jim| author-link= Jim Cox (radio)| title = Mr. Keen, Tracer of Lost Persons: A Complete History and Episode Log of Radio's Most Durable Detective| publisher =McFarland & Company|date=May 2004| location =[[Jefferson, North Carolina]]| isbn=0-7864-1738-2}}</ref>

Chambers's ''[[The King in Yellow]]'' has inspired many modern authors, including [[Karl Edward Wagner]], [[Joseph S. Pulver]], [[Lin Carter]], [[James Blish]], [[Nic Pizzolatto]], [[Michael Cisco]], [[Stephen King]], Ann K. Schwader, [[Robert M. Price]], [[Galad Elflandsson]] and [[Charles Stross]].
