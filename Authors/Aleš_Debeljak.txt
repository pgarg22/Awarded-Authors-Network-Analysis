'''Aleš Debeljak''' (25 December 1961 – 28 January 2016), was a [[Slovenia]]n [[cultural critic]], poet, and [[essayist]].

==Biography==
Debeljak was born in the Slovenian capital [[Ljubljana]], then part of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], to a family with rural origins; he was the first of the family to attend university.<ref name=CBC>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/writersandcompany/ales-debeljak-interview-1.3043764 |title=Ales Debeljak Interview - Home &#124; Writers & Company with Eleanor Wachtel &#124; CBC Radio |website=Cbc.ca |date=2015-04-26 |access-date=2016-01-30}}</ref> 
In his youth he was the junior Slovenian champion in [[judo]], and got a silver medal at the Yugoslav championship.<ref name=delo>{{cite web|url=http://www.delo.si/sobotna/memento-ales-debeljak.html |title=Memento: Aleš Debeljak |website=Delo.si |date=2015-11-07 |access-date=2016-01-30}}</ref> He stopped his sport career after an injury.<ref name=CBC/>

He graduated from [[comparative literature]] at the [[University of Ljubljana]] in 1985.<ref name="ned.univie.ac.at">[http://www.ned.univie.ac.at/lic/autor.asp?paras=/lg;26/lt;26/aut_id;16531/link;3/id;4761/& ]{{dead link|date=January 2016}}</ref> He continued his studies in the [[United States]], obtaining a [[PhD]] in [[sociology of culture]] at [[Syracuse University]] in 1989.<ref name="ned.univie.ac.at"/> He was later a Senior [[Fulbright fellow]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. He also worked at the Institute for Advanced Studies [[Collegium Budapest]], the [[Civitella Ranieri Center]] and  the [[Bogliasco Liguria Study Center for the Arts and Humanities]].<ref>[http://www.drustvo-dsp.si/si/pisatelji/438/detail.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918034112/http://www.drustvo-dsp.si/si/pisatelji/438/detail.html |date=18 September 2010 }}</ref>

From the mid-1980s onwards, Debeljak took an active part in [[civil society]] movements.<ref>[http://www.slovenskapomlad.si/2?id=2663&highlight=aleš%20debeljak] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> He decided to come back to Slovenia at the time of the dissolution of Yugoslavia as, he said, he did not want to become a "Balkan-observer" from abroad, but rather wanted to take part directly in those moments.<ref name=CBC/>

As many others, he had come to accept the idea of Slovenian independence as a second-best option in lack of better alternatives, as every plan for reforming Yugoslavia while conceding more autonomy to Slovenia and Croatia had failed. He still retained and cherished his double identity as a Slovene and as a Yugoslav, and thought that independence had actually limited Slovenia's cultural references: "we lost our attachments to the people of the South, and at the same time we did not gain the same type of emotional attachment to Austria and to other European countries".<ref name=CBC/>

In 1991 he worked as interpreter for foreign media during the [[Ten-Day War]], and witnessed first-hand the Yugoslav-Slovene armed clashes at the Austrian border in [[Gornja Radgona]]. He described the experience as something that changed his point of view, as something that had been deemed impossible was actually taking place, "as if we were in a movie".<ref name=CBC/>

He was one of the co-editors of the critical alternative journal ''[[Nova revija (magazine)|Nova revija]]''. He also participated in the [[social liberal]] [[think tank]] [[Forum 21]], led by former [[President of Slovenia]] [[Milan Kučan]].
He was also, until his death, a professor of cultural studies at the Faculty for Social Studies of the [[University of Ljubljana]].

From 2001 he started the journal ''Sarajevo notebooks'', in order to re-establish communication and linkages between intellectuals and activists throughout former Yugoslavia, and create regional public forums of reconciliation.<ref name=CBC/>

He was married to the columnist, translator and American-Slovenian writer<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.delo.si/kultura/knjizevni-listi/slovenski-pisatelji-ki-pisejo-v-slovenscini-ali-pa-tudi-ne.html |title=Slovenski pisatelji, ki pišejo v slovenščini ali pa tudi ne |website=Delo.si |date=2012-01-24 |access-date=2016-01-30}}</ref> [[Erica Johnson Debeljak]], with whom he had three children. He died on 28 January 2016, when he was struck and killed by a truck.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Debeljak |first1=Erica Johnson |title=Pesnik + smrt = { } |url=https://www.delo.si/sobotna/pesnik-smrt.html |access-date=2 November 2018 |work=Delo |date=28 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://english.sta.si/2225584/eminent-slovenian-author-ales-debeljak-dies |title=STA: Eminent Slovenian author Aleš Debeljak dies |publisher=English.sta.si |access-date=2016-01-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vecer.com/clanek/201601296182480 |title=Večer: Umrl Aleš Debeljak |website=Vecer.com |access-date=2016-01-30}}</ref>

==Poetic works==
Debeljak began publishing poetry in his college years. He was spotted by the poet [[Veno Taufer]] who helped him in the literary scene.<ref name="ned.univie.ac.at"/> His first collection of poetry was  well received also by the poet [[Tomaž Šalamun]], who declared Debeljak as the best poet of the young generation of Slovene authors.<ref>Tomaž Šalamun, "Intervju z Alojzom Ihanom" in ''[[Sodobnost]]'', yr. 42, n. 8/9 (1994)</ref>

Debeljak's poetry is noted for its [[Melancholia (temperament)|melancholy]] and a new reaffirmation of [[traditional values]] such as family and God. An opponent to the everything-goes schools of modern thought, such as [[postmodernism]], Debeljak's work was informed by an "[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]" ideal of right and wrong, good and bad.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Debeljak was an extremely prolific writer.{{fact|date=March 2019}} In addition to poetry and cultural criticism, Debeljak also worked as a columnist for the most important newspaper in Slovenia, ''[[Delo (newspaper)|Delo]]''.{{fact|date=March 2019}} His works have been translated in many languages.{{fact|date=March 2019}}
