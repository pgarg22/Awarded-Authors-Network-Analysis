'''Alexander Scott''' (Scots: Sanderris Scott: 1520?{{snd}}1582/1583) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] Court [[poet]].<ref>Daiches, D. (1982), ''Literature and Gentility in Scotland'', The University Press, Edinburgh</ref> He is believed to have spent most of his time in or near [[Edinburgh]]. Thirty-six short poems are attributed to him, including ''[[Ane New Yeir Gift to Quene Mary]]'', ''[[The Rondel of Love]]'', and a satire, ''[[Justing at the Drum]]''. His poems are included in the [[Bannatyne Manuscript]] (1568) complied by [[George Bannatyne]]. According to an older view, "he has great variety of metre, and is graceful and musical, but his satirical pieces are often extremely coarse".<ref>{{cite SBDEL|wstitle=Scott, Alexander}}</ref>

According to the modern viewpoint of the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', "Because of its range, explicitness, and open-endedness, Scott's work has been described as ethically incoherent, but recent revisions of such essentialist readings have restored his multilayered texts as attractively complex poems, an appealing alternative to contemporary English poetry as anthologized in [[Tottel's Miscellany]] (1557)."<ref>{{cite ODNB|first=Theo van |last=Heijnsbergen |title=Scott, Alexander ({{circa|1520}}â€“1582/3) |year=2004 |id=24857}}</ref>
