'''Fernando António Nogueira Pessoa''' ({{IPA-pt|fɨɾˈnɐ̃du pɨˈsoɐ|lang}}; 13 June 1888 – 30 November 1935) was a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[poet]], [[writer]], [[literary critic]], [[translator]], [[publisher]] and [[philosopher]], described as one of the most significant literary figures of the 20th century and one of the greatest poets in the [[Portuguese language]]. He also wrote in and translated from English and French.

Pessoa was a prolific writer, and not only under his own name, for he created approximately seventy-five others, of which three stand out, Alberto Caeiro, [[Álvaro de Campos]] and Ricardo Reis. He did not call them ''pseudonyms'' because he felt that this did not capture their true independent intellectual life and instead called them [[Heteronym (literature)|''heteronyms'']]. These imaginary figures sometimes held unpopular or extreme views.

[[File:Fernando Pessoa Largo de São Carlos2035.JPG|thumb|200px|Pessoa's birthplace: a large flat at São Carlos Square, just in front of Lisbon's opera.]]
Pessoa was born in [[Lisbon]] on 13 June 1888. When Pessoa was five, his father, Joaquim de Seabra Pessôa, died of [[tuberculosis]] and on 2 January of the following year, his younger brother Jorge, aged one, also died.

After the second marriage of his mother, Maria Magdalena Pinheiro Nogueira, a [[proxy wedding]] to João Miguel dos Santos Rosa, Fernando sailed with his mother for [[South Africa]] in early 1896 to join his stepfather, a [[Portuguese Army|military]] officer appointed Portuguese [[Consul (representative)|consul]] in [[Durban]], capital of the former British [[Colony of Natal]]. In a letter dated 8 February 1918, Pessoa wrote:

[[File:FP triciclo.jpg|thumb|200px| Last year in Lisbon before moving to Durban, 1894, aged 6.]]

{{bquote 
|There is only one event in the past which has both the definiteness and the importance required for rectification by direction; this is my father's death, which took place on 13 July 1893. My mother's second marriage (which took place on 30 December 1895) is another date which I can give with preciseness and it is important for me, not in itself, but in one of its results – the circumstance that, my stepfather becoming Portuguese Consul in Durban (Natal), I was educated there, this English education being a factor of supreme importance in my life, and, whatever my fate be, indubitably shaping it.
The dates of the voyages related to the above event are (as nearly as possible):

1st. voyage to Africa – left Lisbon beginning January 1896.

Return – left Durban in the afternoon of 1st. August 1901.

2nd. voyage to Africa – left Lisbon about 20th. September 1902.

Return – left Durban about 20th. August 1905.<ref>Letter to ''British Journal of Astrology'', W. Foulsham & Co., 61, Fleet Street, London, E.C., 8 February 1918. In Pessoa, Fernando (1999). ''Correspondência 1905–1922'', ed. Manuela Parreira da Silva. Lisboa: Assírio & Alvim, p. 258, {{ISBN|978-85-7164-916-3}}.</ref>}}

The young Pessoa received his early education at St. Joseph Convent School, a [[Roman Catholic]] [[grammar school]] run by [[Irish people|Irish]] and [[French people|French]] nuns. He moved to the [[Durban High School]] in April 1899, becoming fluent in [[English language|English]] and developing an appreciation for [[English literature]]. During the [[Matriculation examination|Matriculation Examination]], held at the time by the University of the Cape of Good Hope (forerunner of the [[University of Cape Town]]), in November 1903, he was awarded the recently created [[Queen Victoria]] Memorial Prize for best paper in English. While preparing to enter university, he also attended the [[Durban Commercial High School]] during one year, taking night classes.

[[File:Pessoa 1898.jpg|thumb|200px|Pessoa in Durban, 1898, aged 10.]]

Meanwhile, Pessoa started writing short stories in English, some under the name of David Merrick, many of which he left unfinished.<ref name = "Zenith, Richard 2008">Zenith, Richard (2008), ''Fotobiografias Século XX: Fernando Pessoa'', Lisboa: Círculo de Leitores.</ref> At the age of sixteen, ''[[The Natal Mercury]]''<ref>[http://www.themercury.co.za/ ''The Natal Mercury'']</ref> (edition of 6 July 1904) published his poem "Hillier did first usurp the realms of rhyme...", under the name of C. R. Anon (anonymous), along with a brief introductory text: "I read with great amusement...". In December, ''The Durban High School Magazine'' published his essay "Macaulay".<ref>Monteiro, Maria da Encarnação (1961), ''Incidências Inglesas na Poesia de Fernando Pessoa, Coimbra:  author ed.''</ref> From February to June 1905, in the section "The Man in the Moon", ''[[The Natal Mercury]]'' also published at least four [[sonnet]]s by Fernando Pessoa: "Joseph Chamberlain", "To England I", "To England II" and "Liberty".<ref>Jennings, H. D. (1984), ''Os Dois Exilios'', Porto: Centro de Estudos Pessoanos</ref> His poems often carried humorous versions of [[Anonymity|Anon]] as the author's name. Pessoa started using [[pen names]] quite young. The first one, still in his childhood, was Chevalier de Pas, supposedly a [[French nobility|French noble]]. In addition to Charles Robert Anon and David Merrick, the young writer also signed up, among other pen names, as Horace James Faber, Alexander Search, and other meaningful names.

In the preface to ''[[The Book of Disquiet]]'', Pessoa wrote about himself:

{{bquote|Nothing had ever obliged him to do anything. He had spent his childhood alone. He never joined any group. He never pursued a course of study. He never belonged to a crowd. The circumstances of his life were marked by that strange but rather common phenomenon – perhaps, in fact, it’s true for all lives – of being tailored to the image and likeness of his instincts, which tended towards inertia and withdrawal.}}

[[File:Pessoa13.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Pessoa in 1901, aged 13.]]
The young Pessoa was described by a schoolfellow as follows:
{{bquote |I cannot tell you exactly how long I knew him, but the period during which I received most of my impressions of him was the whole of the year 1904 when we were at school together. How old he was at this time I don’t know, but judge him to have 15 or 16. [...]

He was pale and thin and appeared physically to be very imperfectly developed. He had a narrow and contracted chest and was inclined to stoop. He had a peculiar walk and some defect in his eyesight gave to his eyes also a peculiar appearance, the lids seemed to drop over the eyes. [...]

He was regarded as a brilliant clever boy as, in spite of the fact that he had not spoken English in his early years, he had learned it so rapidly and so well that he had a splendid style in that language. Although younger than his schoolfellows of the same class he appeared to have no difficulty in keeping up with and surpassing them in work. For one of his age, he thought much and deeply and in a letter to me once complained of "spiritual and material encumbrances of most especial adverseness". [...]

He took no part in athletic sports of any kind and I think his spare time was spent on reading. We generally considered that he worked far too much and that he would ruin his health by so doing.<ref>Clifford E. Geerdts, letter to ''Dr. Faustino Antunes'', 10 April 1907. In Pessoa, Fernando (2003). ''Escritos Autobiográficos, Automáticos e de Reflexão Pessoal'', ed. Richard Zenith. Lisboa: Assírio & Alvim, pp. 394–398.</ref>}}

Ten years after his arrival, he sailed for [[Lisbon]] by East through the [[Suez Canal]] on board the "Herzog", leaving Durban for good at the age of seventeen. This journey inspired the poems "Opiário" (dedicated to his friend, the poet and writer [[Mário de Sá-Carneiro]]) published on March 1915, in the literary journal ''[[Geração de Orpheu|Orpheu]]'' nr.1<ref>[https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23620 ''Orpheu'' nr.1]</ref> and "Ode Marítima" (dedicated to the futurist painter [[Guilherme de Santa-Rita|Santa-Rita]]) published in June 1915, in ''Orpheu'' nr.2<ref>{{citation | publisher = [[Project Gutenberg]] | url = https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23621 | title = Orpheu | issue = 2}}.</ref> by his [[heteronym (literature)|heteronym]] [[Álvaro de Campos]].

==Lisbon revisited==

[[File:Papel timbrado da Empresa Ibis 1.jpg|thumb|200px|"Ibis Enterprise", the first firm established by Pessoa, in 1909.]]

While his family remained in South Africa, Pessoa returned to Lisbon in 1905 to study diplomacy. After a period of illness, and two years of poor results, a [[student strike]] against the dictatorship of Prime Minister [[João Franco]] put an end to his formal studies. Pessoa became an autodidact, a devoted reader who spent a lot of time at the library. In August 1907, he started working as a practitioner at  R.G. Dun & Company, an American mercantile information agency (currently D&B, Dun & Bradstreet). His grandmother died in September and left him a small inheritance, which he spent on setting up his own publishing house, the "Empreza Ibis". The venture was not successful and closed down in 1910, but the name [[ibis]],<ref>Ibe name "ibis" has a very long literary tradition: the elegiac poem ''Ibis'' by [[Ovid]] was inspired in the lost poem of the same title by [[Callimachus]].</ref> the sacred bird of [[Ancient Egypt]] and inventor of the alphabet in [[Greek mythology]], would remain an important symbolic reference for him.

Pessoa returned to his uncompleted formal studies, complementing his British education with self-directed study of Portuguese culture. The pre-revolutionary atmosphere surrounding the assassination of King [[Carlos I of Portugal|Charles I]] and Crown Prince [[Luís Filipe, Prince Royal of Portugal|Luís Filipe]] in 1908, and the patriotic outburst resulting from the successful [[5 October 1910 revolution|republican revolution]] in 1910, influenced the development of the budding writer; as did his step-uncle, Henrique dos Santos Rosa, a poet and retired soldier, who introduced the young Pessoa to [[Portuguese poetry]], notably the romantics and [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolists]] of the 19th century.<ref>{{citation | language = pt | last = Zenith | first = Richard | year = 2008 | series = Fotobiografias do Século XX | title = Fernando Pessoa | place = Lisboa | publisher = Círculo de Leitores | page = 78}}.</ref>  In 1912, Fernando Pessoa entered the literary world with a critical essay, published in the cultural journal ''A Águia'', which triggered one of the most important literary debates in the Portuguese intellectual world of the 20th century: the polemic regarding a super-[[Camões]]. In 1915 a group of artists and poets, including Fernando Pessoa, [[Mário de Sá-Carneiro]] and [[Almada Negreiros]], created the literary magazine ''[[Geração de Orpheu|Orpheu]]'',<ref>{{citation | url = http://purl.pt/12089/2/ | language = pt | title = Orpheu | editor-first = António | editor-last = Ferro | place = Lisboa | date = Jan–Mar 1915 | publisher = Orpheu, Lda. | issue = 1–2}}.</ref> which introduced [[modernist]] literature to Portugal. Only two issues were published (Jan–Feb–Mar and Apr–May–Jun 1915), the third failed to appear due to funding difficulties. Lost for many years, this issue was finally recovered and published in 1984.<ref>{{citation | language = pt | title = Orpheu | editor-first = Arnaldo | editor-last = Saraiva | place = Lisboa | publisher = Edições Ática | issue = 3}}.</ref>  Among other writers and poets, ''[[Geração de Orpheu|Orpheu]]'' published Pessoa, orthonym, and the modernist [[Heteronym (literature)|heteronym]], [[Álvaro de Campos]].

Along with the artist Ruy Vaz, Pessoa also founded the art journal ''Athena'' (1924–25),<ref>{{citation | url = http://casafernandopessoa.cm-lisboa.pt/bdigital/0-28MN/2/0-28MN_item2/index.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130114073338/http://casafernandopessoa.cm-lisboa.pt/bdigital/0-28MN/2/0-28MN_item2/index.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2013-01-14 | language = pt | title = Athena | date = Oct 1924 – Feb 1925 | editor-first = Fernando Pessoa | editor-last = Ruy Vaz | place = Lisboa | publisher = Imprensa Libanio da Silva | issue = 1–5}}.</ref> in which he published verses under the  [[Heteronym (literature)|heteronyms]] Alberto Caeiro and Ricardo Reis. Along with his profession, as free-lance commercial translator, Fernando Pessoa undertook intense activity as a writer, literary critic and political analyst, contributing to the journals and newspapers ''A Águia'' (1912–13), ''A República'' (1913), ''Theatro'' (1913), ''A Renascença'' (1914), ''O Raio'' (1914), ''A Galera'' (1915), ''Orpheu'' (1915), ''O Jornal'' (1915), ''Eh Real!'' (1915), ''Exílio'' (1916), ''Centauro'' (1916), ''A Ideia Nacional'' (1916), ''Terra Nossa'' (1916), ''[[O Heraldo]]'' (1917), ''Portugal Futurista'' (1917), ''Acção'' (1919–20), ''Ressurreição'' (1920), ''Contemporânea'' (1922–26), ''Athena'' (1924–25), ''Diário de Lisboa'' (1924–35), ''Revista de Comércio e Contabilidade'' (1926), ''Sol'' (1926), ''O Imparcial'' (1927), ''Presença'' (1927–34), ''Revista Solução Editora'' (1929–1931), ''Notícias Ilustrado'' (1928–30), ''Girassol'' (1930), ''Revolução'' (1932), ''Descobrimento'' (1932), ''Fama'' (1932–33), ''Fradique'' (1934) and ''Sudoeste'' (1935).

==Pessoa the ''flâneur''==

[[File:Pessoabaixa.jpg|thumb|200px|Pessoa, [[flâneur|a ''flâneur'']] in the streets of Lisbon.]]

After his return to Portugal, when he was seventeen, Pessoa barely left his beloved city of Lisbon, which inspired the poems "Lisbon Revisited" (1923 and 1926), under the [[heteronym (literature)|heteronym]] [[Álvaro de Campos]]. From 1905 to 1920, when his family returned from [[Pretoria]] after the death of his stepfather, he lived in fifteen different locations in the city,<ref>Zenith, Richard (2008), ''Fotobiografias do Século XX: Fernando Pessoa''. Lisboa: Círculo de Leitores, pp. 194–195.</ref> moving from one rented room to another depending on his fluctuating finances and personal troubles.

Pessoa adopted the detached perspective of the [[flâneur]] ''Bernardo Soares'', one of his [[heteronym (literature)|heteronyms]].<ref>Guerreiro, Ricardina (2004), ''De Luto por Existir: a melancolia de Bernardo Soares à luz de Walter Benjamin''. Lisboa: Assírio & Alvim, p. 159.</ref> This character was supposedly an accountant, working for ''Vasques'', the boss of an office located in Douradores Street. ''Soares'' also supposedly lived in the same downtown street, a world that Pessoa knew quite well due to his long career as freelance correspondence translator. Indeed, from 1907 until his death in 1935, Pessoa worked in twenty-one firms located in Lisbon's downtown, sometimes in two or three of them simultaneously.<ref>Sousa, João Rui de (2010), ''Fernando Pessoa Empregado de Escritório'', 2nd ed. Lisboa: Assírio & Alvim.</ref> In ''[[The Book of Disquiet]]'', ''Bernardo Soares'' describes some of those typical places and its "atmosphere". In his daydream soliloquy he also wrote about Lisbon in the first half of the 20th century. ''Soares'' describes crowds in the streets, buildings, shops, traffic, river Tagus, the weather, and even its author, Fernando Pessoa:

[[File:Brasileira 1911.jpg|thumb|200px|Coffee house "[[A Brasileira]]", established in 1905, the year Pessoa returned to Lisbon.]]

{{bquote 
|Fairly tall and thin, he must have been about thirty years old. He hunched over terribly when sitting down but less so standing up, and he dressed with a carelessness that wasn’t entirely careless. In his pale, uninteresting face there was a look of suffering that didn’t add any interest, and it was difficult to say just what kind of suffering this look suggested. It seemed to suggest various kinds: hardships, anxieties, and the suffering born of the indifference that comes from having already suffered a lot.<ref>{{citation | last = Pessoa | first = Fernando | year = 2002 | title = The Book of Disquiet| place = London | publisher = Penguin Books | isbn =  978-0-14-118304-6}}.</ref>}}

A statue of Pessoa sitting at a table (below) can be seen outside [[A Brasileira]], one of the preferred places of young writers and artists of [[Geração de Orpheu|''Orpheu'''s group]] during the 1910s. This coffeehouse, in the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] district of [[Chiado]], is quite close to Pessoa's birthplace: 4, São Carlos Square (just in front of Lisbon's Opera House, where stands another statue of the writer),<ref>[http://www.saocarlos.pt/ Teatro Nacional de São Carlos], Lisbon's Opera House.</ref> one of the most elegant neighborhoods of Lisbon.<ref>{{citation | last = Dias | first = Marina Tavares | year = 2002 | title = Lisboa nos Passos de Pessoa: uma cidade revisitada através da vida e da obra do poeta |trans-title=Lisbon in Pessoa's footsteps: a Lisbon tour through the life and poetry of Fernando Pessoa | place = Lisboa | publisher = Quimera}}.</ref> Later on, Pessoa was a frequent customer at Martinho da Arcada, a centennial coffeehouse in Comercio Square, surrounded by ministries, almost an "office" for his private business and literary concerns, where he used to meet friends in the 1920s and 1930s.

In 1925, Pessoa wrote in English a guidebook to Lisbon but it remained unpublished until 1992.<ref>{{citation | url = http://www.livroshorizonte.pt/catalogo_detalhe.php?idLivro=895 | last = Pessoa | first = Fernando | title = Lisboa: o que o turista deve ver | language = pt, en | place = Lisboa | publisher = Livros Horizonte | edition = 3rd | year = 2006 | orig-year = 1992 | access-date = 18 July 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110816174444/http://www.livroshorizonte.pt/catalogo_detalhe.php?idLivro=895 | archive-date = 16 August 2011 | url-status = dead }}</ref><ref>{{citation | url = http://www.shearsman.com/pages/books/catalog/2008/pessoa_lisbon.html | last = Pessoa | first = Fernando | year = 2008 | title = Lisbon: what the tourist should see | place = Exeter, UK | publisher = Shearsman Books | access-date = 28 July 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110402025713/http://www.shearsman.com/pages/books/catalog/2008/pessoa_lisbon.html | archive-date = 2 April 2011 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}.</ref>

==Literature and occultism==
Pessoa translated a number of Portuguese books into English,<ref>Botto, António (2010), [https://books.google.com/books?id=5OLjUwbV34sC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Botto&hl=pt-PT&sa=X&ei=oZWQT42cG4LC0QWVy_jSAQ&ved=0CEsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=Botto&f=false ''The Songs of António Botto''] translated by Fernando Pessoa. Edited and with an introduction By Josiah Blackmore. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, {{ISBN|978-0-8166-7101-4}},</ref> and into Portuguese ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'' by [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]],<ref>Published in a serial in the Portuguese Journal ''Ilustração'', from 1 January 1926, without a reference to the translator, as usual.</ref> and the short stories "The Theory and the Hound", "The Roads We Take" and "Georgia's Ruling" by [[O. Henry]].<ref>''Athena'' nr. 3, December 1924, pp. 89–102 and nr. 5, February 1925, pp. 173–184.</ref> He has also translated into Portuguese the poetry "[[Godiva]]" by [[Alfred Tennyson]], "[[Lucy]]" by [[William Wordsworth]], "Catarina to Camoens" by [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]],<ref>Fernando Pessoa, ''Obra Poética'', Rio de Janeiro: José Aguilar Editora, 1965.</ref> "[[Barbara Frietchie]]" by [[John Greenleaf Whittier]],<ref>''A Biblioteca Internacional de Obras Célebres'', volumes VI pp. 2807-2809, VII pp. 3534-3535, XX pp. 10215‑10218.</ref> and "[[The Raven]]", "[[Annabel Lee]]" and "[[Ulalume]]" by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]<ref>''Athena'' nr. 1, October 1924, pp. 27–29 and nr. 4, January 1925, pp. 161–164.</ref> who, along with [[Walt Whitman]], strongly influenced him.

As a translator, Pessoa had his own method:

[[File:Pessoa medium.jpg|thumb|200px|Pessoa's alleged mediumship: <br/>Automatic writing sample.]]

{{bquote 
|A poem is an intellectualized impression, an idea made emotion, communicated by others by means of a rhythm. This rhythm is double in one, like the concave and convex aspects of the same arc: it is made up of a verbal or musical rhythm and of a visual or image rhythm which concurs inwardly with it. The translation of a poem should therefore conform absolutely (1) to the idea or emotion which constitutes the poem, (2) to the verbal rhythm in which that idea or emotion is expressed; it should conform relatively to the inner or visual rhythm, keeping to the images themselves when it can, but keeping always to the type of image.
It was on this criterion that I based my translation into Portuguese of Poe’s "Annabel Lee" and "Ulalume", which I translated, not because of their great intrinsic worth, but because they were a standing challenge to translators.<ref>{{citation | last = Pessoa | first = Fernando | year = 1967 | title = Páginas de Estética e de Teoria e Crítica Literárias| place = Lisbon | publisher = Ática }}.</ref>}}

In addition, Pessoa translated into Portuguese some books by the leading [[theosophists]] [[Helena Blavatsky]], [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]], [[Annie Besant]], and [[Mabel Collins]].<ref>

In 1912–14, while living with his aunt "Anica" and cousins,<ref>Ana Luísa Pinheiro Nogueira, his mother's sister was also his godmother, a widow with two children, Maria and Mário. She traveled to Switzerland in November 1914, with her daughter and son-in-law, recently married.</ref> Pessoa took part in "semi-spiritualist sessions" that were carried out at home, but he was considered a "delaying element" by the other members of the sessions. Pessoa's interest in [[spiritualism]] was truly awakened in the second half of 1915, while translating theosophist books. This was further deepened in the end of March 1916, when he suddenly started having experiences where he believed he became a [[Mediumship|medium]], having experimented with [[automatic writing]].<ref>{{citation | last = Pessoa | first = Fernando | year = 1999 | title = Correspondência 1905–1922 | place = Lisbon | publisher = Assírio & Alvim | isbn = 978-85-7164-916-3}}.</ref> On June 24, 1916, Pessoa wrote an impressive letter to his aunt and godmother,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://arquivopessoa.net/textos/531|title= Carta à Tia Anica - 24 Jun. 1916|author=Pessoa, Fernando |website= Arquivo Pessoa|publisher= MultiPessoa|access-date= 8 November 2020|language=pt }}</ref> then living in Switzerland with her daughter and son in law, in which he describes this "mystery case" that surprised him.<ref>{{citation | last = Pessoa | first = Fernando | year = 1999 | title = Correspondência 1905–1922 | place = Lisbon | publisher = Assírio & Alvim | isbn = 978-85-7164-916-3}}.</ref>

Besides automatic writing, Pessoa stated also that he had "astral" or "etherial visions" and was able to see "magnetic auras" similar to radiographic images. He felt "more curiosity than fear", but was respectful towards this phenomenon and asked secrecy, because "there is no advantage, but many disadvantages" in speaking about this. Mediumship exerted a strong influence in Pessoa's writings, who felt "sometimes suddenly being owned by something else" or having a "very curious sensation" in the right arm, which was "lifted into the air" without his will. Looking in the mirror, Pessoa saw several times what appeared to be the [[Heteronym (literature)|heteronyms]]: his "face fading out" and being replaced by the one of "a bearded man", or another one, four men in total.<ref>{{citation | last = Pessoa | first = Fernando | year = 1999 | title = Correspondência 1905–1922 | place = Lisbon | publisher = Assírio & Alvim | isbn = 978-85-7164-916-3}}.</ref>

[[File:Carta astral ricardo reis.jpg|thumb|200px|Astral chart of the [[Heteronym (literature)|heteronym]] ''Ricardo Reis'' by Fernando Pessoa.]]

Pessoa also developed a strong interest in [[astrology]], becoming a competent astrologer. He elaborated hundreds of horoscope, including well-known people such as [[William Shakespeare]], [[Lord Byron]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Chopin]], [[Robespierre]], [[Napoleon I]], [[Benito Mussolini]], [[Wilhelm II]], [[Leopold II of Belgium]], [[Victor Emmanuel III]], [[Alfonso XIII]], or the Kings [[Sebastian I of Portugal|Sebastian]] and [[Carlos I of Portugal|Charles]] of Portugal, and [[António de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]]. In 1915, he created the heteronym ''Raphael Baldaya'', an astrologer who planned to write "System of Astrology" and "Introduction to the Study of Occultism". Pessoa established the pricing of his astrological services from 500 to 5,000 [[Portuguese real|réis]] and made horoscopes of relatives, friends, customers, also of himself and astonishingly of the heteronyms and journals as ''Orpheu''.

Born on June 13, Pessoa was native of Gemini and had Scorpio as rising sign. The characters of the main heteronyms were inspired by the four astral elements: air, fire, water and earth. It means that Pessoa and his heteronyms altogether constituted the full principles of ancient knowledge. Those heteronyms were designed according to their [[horoscope]]s, all including [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], the planet of literature. Astrology was part of his everyday life and Pessoa kept that interest until his death, which he was able to predict with some accuracy.<ref>{{citation | last = Cardoso | first = Paulo | year = 2011 | title = Fernando Pessoa, cartas astrológicas | place = Lisbon | publisher = Bertrand editora | isbn = 978-972-25-2261-8}}.</ref>

As a [[mysticist]], Pessoa was an enthusiast of [[esotericism]], [[occultism]], [[hermetism]], [[numerology]] and [[alchemy]]. Along with spiritualism and astrology, he also paid attention to [[neopaganism]], [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|theosophy]], [[rosicrucianism]] and [[freemasonry]], which strongly influenced his literary work. He has declared himself a Pagan, in the sense of an "intellectual mystic of the sad race of the Neoplatonists from Alexandria" and a believer in "the Gods, their agency and their real and materially superior existence".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://multipessoa.net/labirinto/filosofia/17|title= Pessoa é solicitado para escrever um volume teórico de introdução ao Neopaganismo Português|author=Pessoa, Fernando |date= 1917|publisher= MultiPessoa|access-date= 13 February 2018|language=pt |quote=Eu sou um pagão decadente, do tempo do outono da Beleza; do sonolecer [?] da limpidez antiga, místico intelectual da raça triste dos neoplatónicos da Alexandria.

Como eles creio que acima de tudo, pessoa impassível, causa imóvel e convicta [?], paira o Destino, superior ao bem e ao mal, estranho à Beleza e à Fealdade, além da Verdade e da Mentira. Mas não creio que entre o Destino e os Deuses haja só o oceano turvo [...] o céu mudo da Noite eterna. Creio, como os neoplatónicos, no Intermediário Intelectual, Logos na linguagem dos filósofos, Cristo (depois) na mitologia cristã.}}</ref> His interest in occultism led Pessoa to correspond with [[Aleister Crowley]] and later helped him to elaborate a fake suicide, when Crowley visited Portugal in 1930.<ref>{{citation | url = http://www.nthposition.com/themagicalworldof.php | publisher = Nthposition | title = The magical world of Fernando Pessoa | access-date = 1 November 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170908112435/http://www.nthposition.com/themagicalworldof.php | archive-date = 8 September 2017 | url-status = dead }}.</ref> Pessoa translated Crowley's poem "Hymn To Pan"<ref>''Presença'' nr. 33 (July–October 1931).</ref> into Portuguese, and the catalogue of Pessoa's library shows that he possessed Crowley's books ''Magick in Theory and Practice'' and ''Confessions''.

Pessoa declared about secret societies:

{{bquote |I am also very interested in knowing whether a second edition is shortly to be expected of Athur Edward Waite’s ''The Secret Tradition in Freemasonery''. I see that, in a note on page 14 of his ''Emblematic Freemasonery'', published by you in 1925, he says, in respect of the earlier work: "A new and revised edition is in the forefront of my literary schemes." For all I know, you may already have issued such an edition; if so, I have missed the reference in ''The Times Literary Supplement''. Since I am writing on these subjects, I should like to put a question which perhaps you can reply to; but please do not do so if the reply involves any inconvenience. I believe ''The Occult Review'' was, or is, issued by yourselves; I have not seen any number for a long time. My question is in what issue of that publication – it was certainly a long while ago – an article was printed relating to the Roman Catholic Church as a Secret Society, or, alternatively, to a Secret Society within the Roman Catholic Church.<ref>Fernando Pessoa, letter to Rider & C., Paternoster Row, London, E.C.4., 20 October 1933.

Literary critic [[Martin Lüdke]] described Pessoa's philosophy as a kind of [[pandeism]], especially those writings under the [[heteronym (literature)|heteronym]] Alberto Caeiro.<ref>[[Martin Lüdke]], "Ein moderner Hüter der Dinge; Die Entdeckung des großen Portugiesen geht weiter: Fernando Pessoa hat in der Poesie Alberto Caeiros seinen Meister gesehen", ("A modern guardian of things; The discovery of the great Portuguese continues: Fernando Pessoa saw its master in the poetry of Alberto Caeiro"), ''[[Frankfurter Rundschau]]'', 18 August 2004. "Caeiro unterläuft die Unterscheidung zwischen dem Schein und dem, was etwa "Denkerge-danken" hinter ihm ausmachen wollen. Die Dinge, wie er sie sieht, sind als was sie scheinen. Sein Pan-Deismus basiert auf einer Ding-[[metaphysics|Metaphysik]], die in der modernen Dichtung des zwanzigsten Jahrhunderts noch Schule machen sollte." ''Translation'': "Caeiro interposes the distinction between the light and what "philosopher thoughts" want to constitute behind him. The things, as he sees them, are as they seem. His pandeism is based on a metaphysical thing, which should still become a school of thought under the modern seal of the twentieth century."</ref>

==Writing a lifetime==
[[File:Pessoacopo.jpg|thumb|200px|Pessoa in 1929, drinking a glass of wine in a tavern of Lisbon's downtown.]]

In his early years, Pessoa was influenced by major English classic poets such as [[Shakespeare]], [[John Milton|Milton]] and [[Alexander Pope|Pope]], or romantics like [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]], [[Lord Byron|Byron]], [[John Keats|Keats]], [[Wordsworth]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] and [[Tennyson]].<ref>{{citation | last = Zenith | first = Richard | year = 2008 | title = Fotobiografias do Século XX: Fernando Pessoa | place = Lisboa | publisher = Círculo de Leitores | pages = 40–41}}.</ref> After his return to Lisbon in 1905, Pessoa was influenced by French [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolists]] and [[decadentism|decadentists]] as [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Maurice Rollinat]], [[Stéphane Mallarmé]]; mainly by [[Portuguese poetry|Portuguese poets]] as [[Antero de Quental]], [[Gomes Leal]], [[Cesário Verde]], [[António Nobre]], [[Camilo Pessanha]] or [[Teixeira de Pascoaes]]. Later on, he was also influenced by [[modernism|modernists]] as [[W. B. Yeats]], [[James Joyce]], [[Ezra Pound]] and [[T. S. Eliot]], among many other writers.<ref name= "Zenith, Richard 2008"/>

During [[World War I]], Pessoa wrote to a number of British publishers, namely Constable & Co. Ltd. (currently [[Constable & Robinson]]), trying to arrange publication of his collection of English verse ''The Mad Fiddler'' (unpublished during his lifetime), but it was refused. However, in 1920, the prestigious literary journal ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenaeum]]'' included one of those poems.<ref>{{citation | last = Terlinden | first = Anne | year = 1990 | title = Fernando Pessoa, the bilingual Portuguese poet: A Critical Study of "The Mad Fidler" | place = Bruxelles | publisher = Facultés Universitaires Saint-Louis | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pofTVSteuaIC | isbn = 978-2-8028-0075-0}}.</ref> Since the attempt at British publication failed, in 1918 Pessoa published in Lisbon two slim volumes of English verse: ''[[Antinous]]''<ref>{{citation | url = http://purl.pt/13961/2/ | title = Antinous | publisher = at the Portuguese National Library}}f.</ref> and ''[[35 Sonnets]]'',<ref>[http://purl.pt/13963/2/ ''35 Sonnets''] at the Portuguese National Library.</ref> received by the British literary press without enthusiasm.<ref>''The Times Literary Supplement'', 19 September 1918. ''Athenaeum'', January 1919.</ref> Along with some friends, he founded another publishing house – Olisipo – which published in 1921 a further two English poetry volumes: ''English Poems I–II'' and ''English Poems III'' by Fernando Pessoa. In his publishing house, Pessoa issued also some books by his friends: ''A Invenção do Dia Claro'' (The invention of the clear day) by [[José de Almada Negreiros]], ''Canções'' (Songs) by [[António Botto]], and ''Sodoma Divinizada'' (Deified [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]]) by [[Raul Leal]] (Henoch).<ref>Pessoa translated into English the poetry book ''Songs'' by António Botto ([https://books.google.com/books?id=5OLjUwbV34sC&printsec=frontcover&dq=antonio+botto&hl=pt-PT&sa=X&ei=gd7FUIihK8jOhAefqICABA&ved=0CD0Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=antonio%20botto&f=false ''The Songs of António Botto, translated by Fernando Pessoa'']) and left unfinished the translation of ''The invention of the clear day'' by Almada Negreiros</ref> Olisipo closed down in 1923, following the scandal known as "Literatura de Sodoma" (Literature of Sodom), which Pessoa started with his paper "António Botto e o Ideal Estético em Portugal" (António Botto and the aesthetical ideal in Portugal), published in the journal ''Contemporanea''.<ref>[http://hemerotecadigital.cm-lisboa.pt/OBRAS/CONTEMPORANEA/Contemporanea.htm''Contemporanea''], May–July 1922, pp. 121–126.</ref>

In his lifetime, he published four books in English and one alone in Portuguese: ''Mensagem'' (Message). However, he left a lifetime of unpublished, unfinished or just sketchy work in a domed, wooden trunk (25,574<ref>Caption to photo 32, opposite page 115, in: Lisboa, E. and Taylor, L.

==The triumphant day==

{{bquote 
|[…] on 8 March 1914 – I found myself standing before a tall chest of drawers, took up a piece of paper, began to write, remaining upright all the while since I always stand when I can. I wrote thirty some poems in a row, all in a kind of ecstasy, the nature of which I shall never fathom. It was the triumphant day of my life, and I shall never have another like it. I began with a title, The Keeper of Sheep. And what followed was the appearance of someone within me to whom I promptly assigned the name of Alberto Caeiro. Please excuse the absurdity of what I am about to say, but there had appeared within me, then and there, my own master. It was my immediate sensation. So much so that, with those thirty odd poems written, I immediately took up another sheet of paper and wrote as well, in a row, the six poems that make up "Oblique Rain" by Fernando Pessoa. Immediately and totally... It was the return from Fernando Pessoa/Alberto Caeiro to Fernando Pessoa alone. Or better still, it was Fernando Pessoa’s reaction to his own inexistence as Alberto Caeiro.<ref>Fernando Pessoa, "Letter to Adolfo Casais Monteiro", January 13, 1935, tr. by George Monteiro,[https://www.brown.edu/Departments/Portuguese_Brazilian_Studies/ejph/pessoaplural/issues.html "Imaginary poets in a real world" in ''Pessoa Plural''] Issue 9, Spring 2016, p. 301.</ref>
}}
As the fake heteronym Coelho Pacheco, over a long period Pessoa's "triumphant day" was taken as real, however, it has been proved that this event was one more fiction created by Pessoa.<ref>Castro, Ivo, "O corpus de 'O Guardador de Rebanhos' depositado na Biblioteca Nacional", Separata da ''Revista da Biblioteca Nacional'', vol. 2, n.º 1, 1982, pp. 47-61.</ref>

==Heteronyms==
[[File:Lisboa-Pessoa-A Brasileira-1.jpg|thumb|200px|Pessoa's statue outside Lisbon's famous coffeehouse "[[A Brasileira]]".]]

Pessoa's earliest [[Heteronym (literature)|heteronym]], at the age of six, was '''Chevalier de Pas'''. Other childhood heteronyms included '''Dr. Pancrácio''' and '''David Merrick''', followed by '''Charles Robert Anon''', an English young man that became Pessoa's ''[[alter ego]]''. In 1905/7, when Pessoa was a student at the [[University of Lisbon]], '''Alexander Search''' took the place of Anon. The main reason for this was that, although Search is English, he was born in Lisbon as his author. But Search represents a transition heteronym that Pessoa used while searching to adapt to the Portuguese cultural reality. After the republican revolution, in 1910, and consequent patriotic atmosphere, Pessoa created another ''alter ego'', '''[[Álvaro de Campos]]''', supposedly a Portuguese naval engineer, born in [[Tavira]] and graduated in [[Glasgow]]. Translator and literary critic Richard Zenith notes that Pessoa eventually established at least seventy-two heteronyms.<ref>''The Book of Disquiet'', tr. Richard Zenith, Penguin classics, 2003.</ref> According to Pessoa himself, there are three main heteronyms: '''Alberto Caeiro''', '''Álvaro de Campos''' and '''Ricardo Reis'''. Pessoa's [[Heteronym (literature)|heteronyms]] differ from pen names, because they possess distinct biographies, temperaments, philosophies, appearances, writing styles and even signatures.<ref>Letter to Adolfo Casais Monteiro, 13 January 1935.</ref> Thus, [[Heteronym (literature)|heteronyms]] often disagree on various topics, argue and discuss with each other about literature, aesthetics, philosophy, etc.

Pessoa wrote on the heteronyms:
{{bquote |How do I write in the name of these three? Caeiro, through sheer and unexpected inspiration, without knowing or even suspecting that I’m going to write in his name. Ricardo Reis, after an abstract meditation, which suddenly takes concrete shape in an ode. Campos, when I feel a sudden impulse to write and don’t know what. (My semi-heteronym Bernardo Soares, who in many ways resembles Álvaro de Campos, always appears when I'm sleepy or drowsy, so that my qualities of inhibition and rational thought are suspended; his prose is an endless reverie. He’s a semi-heteronym because his personality, although not my own, doesn’t differ from my own but is a mere mutilation of it. He’s me without my rationalism and emotions. His prose is the same as mine, except for certain formal restraint that reason imposes on my own writing, and his Portuguese is exactly the same – whereas Caeiro writes bad Portuguese, Campos writes it reasonably well but with mistakes such as "me myself" instead of "I myself", etc.., and Reis writes better than I, but with a purism I find excessive...).<ref>"Letter to Adolfo Casais Monteiro", January 13, 1935, in Pessoa, Fernando (2003), ''The Book of Disquiet'', tr. Richard Zenith. London: Penguin classics, p. 474.</ref>}}

===Alberto Caeiro===

Alberto Caeiro was Pessoa's first great heteronym; it is summarized by Pessoa as follows: "He sees things with the eyes only, not with the mind. He does not let any thoughts arise when he looks at a flower... the only thing a stone tells him is that it has nothing at all to tell him... this way of looking at a stone may be described as the totally unpoetic way of looking at it. The stupendous fact about Caeiro is that out of this sentiment, or rather, absence of sentiment, he makes poetry."<ref>{{Cite book |title=Fernando Pessoa & Co. : selected poems|last1=Pessoa|first1=Fernando |date=1998|publisher=Grove Press|last2=Zenith |first2=Richard |isbn=0802116280|edition=1st |location=New York|pages=40|oclc=38055974}}</ref>

What this means, and what makes Caeiro such an original poet is the way he apprehends existence. He does not question anything whatsoever; he calmly accepts the world as it is. The recurrent themes to be found in nearly all of Caeiro's poems are wide-eyed childlike wonder at the infinite variety of nature, as noted by a critic. He is free of [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] entanglements. Central to his world-view is the idea that in the world around us, all is surface: things are precisely what they seem, there is no hidden meaning anywhere.

He manages thus to free himself from the anxieties that batter his peers; for Caeiro, things simply exist and we have no right to credit them with more than that. Caeiro attains happiness by not questioning, and by thus avoiding doubts and uncertainties. He apprehends reality solely through his eyes, through his senses. [[Octavio Paz]] called him the innocent poet. Paz made a shrewd remark on the heteronyms: In each are particles of negation or unreality. Reis believes in form, Campos in sensation, Pessoa in symbols. Caeiro doesn't believe in anything. He exists.<ref>Paz, Octavio (1983), "El Desconocido de Si Mismo: Fernando Pessoa", in ''Los Signos en Rotacion y Otros Ensayos'', Madrid: Alianza Editorial.</ref>

Poetry before Caeiro was essentially interpretative; what poets did was to offer an interpretation of their perceived surroundings; Caeiro does not do this. Instead, he attempts to communicate his senses, and his feelings, without any interpretation whatsoever.

Caeiro attempts to approach Nature from a qualitatively different mode of apprehension; that of simply perceiving (an approach akin to [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] approaches to philosophy). Poets before him would make use of intricate metaphors to describe what was before them; not so Caeiro: his self-appointed task is to bring these objects to the reader's attention, as directly and simply as possible. Caeiro sought a direct experience of the objects before him.

As such it is not surprising to find that Caeiro has been called an anti-intellectual, anti-Romantic, anti-subjectivist, anti-metaphysical...an anti-poet, by critics; Caeiro simply-is. He is in this sense very unlike his creator Fernando Pessoa: Pessoa was besieged by metaphysical uncertainties; these were, to a large extent, the cause of his unhappiness; not so Caeiro: his attitude is anti-metaphysical; he avoided uncertainties by adamantly clinging to a certainty: his belief that there is no meaning behind things. Things, for him, simply-are.

Caeiro represents a primal vision of reality, of things. He is the pagan incarnate. Indeed, Caeiro was not simply a pagan but paganism itself.<ref>Pessoa, Fernando, Notas Para Recordação do Meu Mestre Caeiro ''in Presença'' nr. 30, Jan.-Feb. 1930, Coimbra.</ref>

The critic Jane M. Sheets sees the insurgence of Caeiro — who was Pessoa's first major heteronym — as essential in founding the later poetic ''personae'': By means of this artless yet affirmative anti-poet, Caeiro, a short-lived but vital member of his coterie, Pessoa acquired the base of an experienced and universal poetic vision. After Caeiro's tenets had been established, the avowedly poetic voices of Campos, Reis and Pessoa himself spoke with greater assurance.<ref>Sheets, Jane M., Fernando Pessoa as Anti-Poet: Alberto Caeiro, ''in Bulletin of Hispanic Studies'', Vol. XLVI, Nr. 1, January 1969, pp. 39–47.</ref>

===Ricardo Reis===

[[File:Athena_Revista_de_Arte N.1 Outubro 1924.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Athena — Art Journal'' <br> (5 issues edited by Pessoa and Ruy Vaz in 1924-1925), published poetry by Pessoa, ''Ricardo Reis'', and ''Alberto Caeiro'', as well as essays by ''[[Álvaro de Campos]]''.]]

In a letter to William Bentley,<ref>This letter, to the director of the journal ''Portugal'', was written on 31 October 1924, to announce Pessoa's art journal ''Athena''.</ref>  Pessoa wrote that "a ''knowledge'' of the language would be indispensable, for instance, to appraise the 'Odes' of Ricardo Reis, whose Portuguese would draw upon him the blessing of [[António Vieira]], as his stile and diction that of [[Horace]] (he has been called, admirably I believe, 'a Greek Horace who writes in Portuguese')".<ref>Pessoa, Fernando (1999), ''Correspondência 1923–1935'', ed. Manuela Parreira da Silva. Lisboa: Assírio & Alvim, p.53, {{ISBN|972-37-0531-1}}.</ref>

Reis, both a character and a heteronym of Fernando Pessoa himself,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Marilyn Scarantino|title=Pessoa's Poetic Coterie: Three Heteronyms and an Orthonym|journal=Luso-Brazilian Review|date=1 January 1977|volume=14|issue=2|pages=254–262 |jstor=3513064}}</ref> sums up his philosophy of life in his own words, admonishing, "See life from a distance. Never question it. There's nothing it can tell you." Like Caeiro, whom he admires, Reis defers from questioning life. He is a modern pagan who urges one to seize the day and accept fate with tranquility. "Wise is the one who does not seek. The seeker will find in all things the abyss, and doubt in himself."<ref>{{cite web
|author1=Reis, Ricardo (pseud.)

|quote=Sábio deveras o que não procura, / Que, procurando, achara o abismo em tudo / E a dúvida em si mesmo.}}</ref> In this sense, Reis shares essential affinities with Caeiro.

Believing in the [[Greek mythology|Greek gods]], yet living in a Christian Europe, Reis feels that his spiritual life is limited and true happiness cannot be attained. This, added to his belief in Fate as a driving force for all that exists, as such disregarding freedom, leads to his [[epicureanism|epicureanist]] philosophy, which entails the avoidance of pain, defending that man should seek tranquility and calm above all else, avoiding emotional extremes.

Where Caeiro wrote freely and spontaneously, with joviality, of his basic, meaningless connection to the world, Reis writes in an austere, cerebral manner, with premeditated rhythm and structure and a particular attention to the correct use of the language when approaching his subjects of, as characterized by Richard Zenith, "the brevity of life, the vanity of wealth and struggle, the joy of simple pleasures, patience in time of trouble, and avoidance of extremes".

In his detached, intellectual approach, he is closer to Fernando Pessoa's constant rationalization, as such representing the orthonym's wish for measure and sobriety and a world free of troubles and respite, in stark contrast to Caeiro's spirit and style. As such, where Caeiro's predominant attitude is that of joviality, his sadness being accepted as natural ("My sadness is a comfort for it is natural and right."), Reis is marked by melancholy, saddened by the impermanence of all things.

Ricardo Reis is the main character of [[José Saramago]]'s 1986 novel ''[[The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis]]''.

===Álvaro de Campos===
{{Main|Álvaro de Campos}}

[[File:Portugal Futurista 1 1917.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Portugal Futurista'', the art journal that published ''Campos''' "Ultimatum" in 1917.]]

[[Álvaro de Campos]] manifests, in a way, as a hyperbolic version of Pessoa himself. Of the three heteronyms he is the one who feels most strongly, his motto being 'to feel everything in every way.' 'The best way to travel,' he wrote, 'is to feel.' As such, his poetry is the most emotionally intense and varied, constantly juggling two fundamental impulses: on the one hand a feverish desire to be and feel everything and everyone, declaring that 'in every corner of my soul stands an altar to a different god' (alluding to [[Walt Whitman]]'s desire to 'contain multitudes'), on the other, a wish for a state of isolation and a sense of nothingness.

As a result, his mood and principles varied between violent, dynamic exultation, as he fervently wishes to experience the entirety of the universe in himself, in all manners possible (a particularly distinctive trait in this state being his [[Futurism (art)|futuristic]] leanings, including the expression of great enthusiasm as to the meaning of city life and its components) and a state of nostalgic melancholy, where life is viewed as, essentially, empty.

One of the poet's constant preoccupations, as part of his dichotomous character, is that of identity: he does not know who he is, or rather, fails at achieving an ideal identity. Wanting to be everything, and inevitably failing, he despairs. Unlike Caeiro, who asks nothing of life, he asks too much. In his poetic meditation 'Tobacco Shop' he asks:

{{bquote|How should I know what I'll be, I who don't know what I am?<br>
To be what I think? But I think of being so many things!}}

==Summaries of selected works==

===''Message''===

[[File:1edicao Mensagem 1934.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Mensagem'', first edition, 1934.]]

''Mensagem'',<ref name="FPMessagemEdEF2016">{{cite book |author-last= Pessoa |author-first= Fernando |editor-last= Freitas |editor-first= Eduardo |year=2016 |language= pt 
|title= A Mensagem: Editado por Eduardo Filipe Freitas |publisher= CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform
|isbn= 978-1-535-19909-4}}</ref> written in Portuguese, is a symbolist epic made up of 44 short poems organized in three parts or Cycles:<ref>''Message'', Tr. by [[Jonathan Griffin]], Exeter: Shearsman Books, 2007.</ref>

The first, called "Brasão" (Coat-of-Arms), relates Portuguese historical protagonists to each of the fields and charges in the [[Coat of arms of Portugal|Portuguese coat of arms]]. The first two poems ("The castles" and "The escutcheons") draw inspiration from the material and spiritual natures of Portugal. Each of the remaining poems associates to each charge a historical personality. Ultimately they all lead to the [[Portuguese discoveries|Golden Age of Discovery]].

The second Part, called "Mar Português" (Portuguese Sea), references the country's Age of Portuguese Exploration and to [[Portuguese Empire|its seaborne Empire]] that ended with the death of [[Sebastian of Portugal|King Sebastian]] at [[Ksar el-Kebir|El-Ksar el Kebir]] (''Alcácer-Quibir'' in Portuguese) in 1578. Pessoa brings the reader to the present as if he had woken up from a dream of the past, to fall in a dream of the future: he sees King Sebastian returning and still bent on accomplishing a Universal Empire.

The third Cycle, called "O Encoberto" ("The Hidden One"), refers to Pessoa's vision of a future world of peace and the [[Fifth Empire]] (which, according to Pessoa, is spiritual and not material, because if it were material England would already have achieved it). After the Age of Force, (Vis), and Taedium (Otium) will come Science (understanding) through a reawakening of "The Hidden One", or "King Sebastian". The Hidden One represents the fulfillment of the destiny of mankind, designed by God since before Time, and the accomplishment of Portugal.

King Sebastian is very important, indeed he appears in all three parts of Mensagem. He represents the capacity of dreaming, and believing that it's possible to achieve dreams.

One of the most famous quotes from ''Mensagem'' is the first line from ''O Infante'' (belonging to the second Part), which is ''Deus quer, o homem sonha, a obra nasce'' (which translates roughly to "God wishes, man dreams, the work is born"). Another well-known quote from ''Mensagem'' is the first line from ''Ulysses'', "O mito é o nada que é tudo" (a possible translation is "The myth is the nothing that is all"). This poem refers to  [[Odysseus|Ulysses]], king of [[Ithaca]], as Lisbon's founder (recalling an ancient Greek myth).<ref>

===Literary essays===

[[File:A Aguia.JPG|thumb|right|200px|''A Águia — Organ of the Portuguese Renaissance'' — issue nr. 4, April 1912.]]

In 1912, Fernando Pessoa wrote a set of essays (later collected as ''The New Portuguese Poetry'') for the cultural journal ''A Águia'' (The Eagle), founded in [[Porto|Oporto]], in December 1910, and run by the republican association Renascença Portuguesa.<ref>Martins, Fernando Cabral (coord.) (2008). ''Dicionário de Fernando Pessoa e do Modernismo Português''. Alfragide: Editorial Caminho.</ref> In the first years of the [[Portuguese Republic]], this cultural association was started by republican intellectuals led by the writer and poet [[Teixeira de Pascoaes]], philosopher Leonardo Coimbra and historian Jaime Cortesão, aiming for the renewal of Portuguese culture through the aesthetic movement called Saudosismo.<ref>The Portuguese Republic was founded by the revolution of 5 October 1910, giving freedom of association and publishing.</ref> Pessoa contributed to the journal ''A Águia'' with a series of papers: 'The new Portuguese Poetry Sociologically Considered' (nr. 4), 'Relapsing...' (nr. 5) and 'The Psychological Aspect of the new Portuguese Poetry' (nrs. 9,11 and 12). These writings were strongly encomiastic to saudosist literature, namely the poetry of [[Teixeira de Pascoaes]] and [[Mário Beirão]]. The articles disclose Pessoa as a connoisseur of modern European literature and an expert of recent literary trends. On the other hand, he does not care much for a methodology of analysis or problems in the history of ideas. He states his confidence that Portugal would soon produce a great poet – a super-[[Camões]] – pledged to make an important contribution for European culture, and indeed, for humanity.<ref>Pessoa, Fernando (1993). ''Textos de Crítica e de Intervenção''. Lisboa: Edições Ática.</ref>

===Philosophical essays===
The philosophical notes of the young Pessoa, mostly written between 1905 and 1912, illustrate his debt to the history of [[Philosophy]] more through commentators than through a first-hand protracted reading of the Classics, ancient or modern.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The issues he engages with pertain to every philosophical discipline and concern a large profusion of concepts, creating a vast semantic spectrum in texts whose length varies between half a dozen lines and half a dozen pages and whose density of analysis is extremely variable; simple paraphrasis, expression of assumptions and original speculation.

Pessoa sorted the philosophical systems thus:

[[File:A Mensagem. Fernando Pessoa.jpg|thumb|300px|A passage from his famous poem "Mar Português" from ''Message'', in the city of [[Lagos, Portugal]].]]

# Relative Spiritualism and relative Materialism privilege "Spirit" or "Matter" as the main pole that organizes data around Experience.
# Absolute Spiritualist and Absolute Materialist "deny all objective reality to one of the elements of Experience".
# The materialistic [[Pantheism]] of [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] and the spiritualizing Pantheism of [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]], "admit that experience is a double manifestation of any thing that in its essence has no matter neither spirit".
# Considering both elements as an "illusory manifestation", of a transcendent and true and alone realities, there is [[Transcendentalism]], inclined into matter with [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], or into spirit, a position where [[Henri Bergson|Bergson]] could be emplaced.
# A terminal system "the limited and summit of metaphysics" would not radicalize – as poles of experience – one of the single categories: matter, relative, absolute, real, illusory, spirit. Instead, matching all categories, it takes contradiction as "the essence of the universe" and defends that "an affirmation is so more true insofar the more contradiction involves". The transcendent must be conceived beyond categories. There ''is one only and eternal example of it. It is that cathedral of thought -the philosophy of [[Hegel]].''
Such [[pantheist]] [[transcendentalism]] is used by Pessoa to define the project that "encompasses and exceeds all systems"; to characterize the new poetry of '''Saudosismo''' where the "typical contradiction of this system" occurs; to inquire of the particular social and political results of its adoption as the leading cultural paradigm; and, at last, he hints that metaphysics and religiosity strive "to find in everything a beyond".

November 18, 2013, at the Woodberry Poetry Room, Harvard University.<br />
As a part of our Omniglot Seminar series, Portuguese translator Richard Zenith read from his translations of Luís de Camões, Fernando Pessoa and Carlos Drummond de Andrade. He compared his experiences translating archaic vs. contemporary linguistic registers, highly formal poetry vs. free verse, and European vs. Brazilian Portuguese. And he discussed the unique challenge of translating (and researching a biography of) a poet such as Pessoa, with alter egos that wrote in radically different styles.

Richard Zenith presented a lecture on Fernando Pessoa, one of Portugal's most important literary figures of the 20th century and a towering figure in modernism.

In this poem, Pessoa creates an inner struggle that the speaker has with trying to figure out whether it was fate or free will that has determined how his life panned out. By making the whole poem essentially one, elongated metaphor, Pessoa is able to give multiple interpretations to his poem. In the titular first line of the first stanza, Pessoa states “I don’t know how many souls I have”. Automatically, Pessoa causes the speaker to question his morality and inner being. Line two of the first stanza has a literal translation of “each time changed.” When put in context, it becomes apparent that the speaker is referring to himself that changes so often. These two lines become the foundation for the rest of the poem, seeing as they set up a questioning within the speaker. The translations of these two lines are also crucial to fully grasp the meaning of the poem as a whole.
