'''Lasana M. Sekou''' (born 12 January 1959) is a [[poet]], short story writer, essayist, journalist, and [[publisher]] from the [[Caribbean]] island of [[Saint Martin (island)|Saint Martin]].

==Biography==
Lasana M. Sekou has authored over 20 books and is considered one of the prolific Caribbean poets of his generation. Dr. [[Armando Lampe]] writes that "he's considered the 'Walcott' of the Dutch Caribbean"<ref>Lampe, Armando. "Examen de libros por la aparición de Double Play." ''RMC'', 10 (2000), 233–240.</ref> because of his prolific output, the range of subject matter and unique [[literary]] styling, which often includes the use of Caribbean [[Creole language|Creole]] languages, [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] — sometimes in one poem.
