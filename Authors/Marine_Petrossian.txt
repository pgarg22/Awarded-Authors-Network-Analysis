'''Marine Petrossian''' (written also as  Mariné Petrossian, {{lang-hy|Մարինե Պետրոսյան}}; born 16 August 1960) is an [[Armenia]]n poet, essayist and columnist.

==Poet==
The start of Marine Petrossian’s literary career coincided with the ending of the [[Soviet Union]]. Her first book was published in [[Yerevan]] in 1993, just two years after [[Armenia]], formerly [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet Republic]], became independent.

The poems of this volume were translated into French by [[Vahe Godel]] and in 1995 French Editions Comp’Act published ''J’apporterai des pierres'' by Petrossian. Encouraged by success of the book (a favorable review, among others, was published in [[Le Monde]]<ref>Patrick Kéchichian, «Fleur épineuse». Le Monde des Livres, 22.09.1995</ref>) Editions Comp’Act soon published the second book of Marine Petrossian, ''Erevan'', 2003.

Since then, Petrossian has published another four volumes of poetry in Armenia.

In 2015, Argentinian publisher Audisea published ''Disparó el arma'' by Petrossian, comprising poems translated into Spanish by Alice Ter-Ghevondian. The presentation of the book took place at the [[National Library of the Argentine Republic|National Library of Argentina]] and well-known newspaper [[Página/12]] invited Petrossian to interview.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/espectaculos/4-36458-2015-08-25.html | title="La escritura puede ser un arma": La poeta Armenia Marine Petrossian presenta su libro Disparó el arma. Por Silvina Friera. Página/12, martes, 25 de agosto de 2015}}. Retrieved 11 November 2015</ref>

Petrossian has been writer-in-residence at [[Djerassi Artists Residency]], [[Woodside, California|Woodside]], California, as Artist Laureate of UNESCO-Aschberg bursaries (2005); at Q21, [[MuseumsQuartier]] [[Vienna]] (2013);  as well as at [[Omi International Arts Center]], [[New York City]] (2015).

Petrossian [[Self-translation|self-translates]] her poetry into English. Some of her self-translations can be found in Transcript – Europe's online review of international writing, as well as in ''Deviation, Anthology of Contemporary Armenian Literature'' {{ISBN|978-99941-2-188-5}}

==Essayist== 
Petrossian’s essay ''"Antipoetry, or When the Poet Does Not Seek an Alibi"'' <ref>''Անտիպոեզիա, կամ երբ բանաստեղծը չի փնտրում ալիբի'' (Antipoetry, or When the Poet Does not Seek an Alibi): Գրական թերթ, #10, 4 օգոստոս, 2000թ.</ref> has aroused intense discussions in [[Armenia]]n literary circles. In this essay, Petrossian speaks about "antipoetry"—poetry that does not look like poetry and challenges the prevailing notion of poetry—and asserts that it is the leading tendency in contemporary Armenian poetry.

Marine Petrossian is largely known in [[Armenia]] also as a columnist. In 2007-2009, a period of tense political developments before and after [[Armenian presidential election, 2008]], she led a weekly column in ''Haikakan jamanak'' (Armenian Times) daily, the main opposition newspaper. Her essays on political issues of the day had an unprecedently large readership and made her a public figure in Armenia: many TV programs invite her to comment on public issues.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGrvFXpoT0o | title=Debate on proposed changes to Constitution, Kentron TV, "Armenian Friday" program}} 18 September 2015.

Retrieved 11 November 2015</ref> These essays later were collected in her book ''Red Poster'' (2011). In 2007, Petrossian received "Tigran Hayrapetian" award for her essay "Why the War does not Come to an End".
