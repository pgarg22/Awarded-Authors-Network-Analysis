'''Fukuda Chiyo-ni''' ('''Kaga no Chiyo''') (福田 千代尼; 1703 - 2 October 1775) was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[poet]] of the [[Edo period]] and a [[Bhikkhunī|Buddhist nun]].<ref name="Donegan2010">{{cite book|author=Patricia Donegan|title=Haiku Mind: 108 Poems to Cultivate Awareness and Open Your Heart|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r4NofHvdOPcC&pg=PA186|year=2010|publisher=Shambhala Publications|isbn=978-0-8348-2235-1|pages=186}}</ref> She is widely regarded as one of the greatest poets of [[haiku]] (then called [[hokku]]). Some of Chiyo's best works include The Morning Glory, Putting up my hair, and Again the women.

Being one of the few women haiku poets in pre-modern [[Japanese literature]], Chiyo-ni has been seen an influential figure. Before her time, haiku by women were often dismissed and ignored. She began writing Haiku at seven and by age seventeen she had become very popular all over [[Tokugawa shogunate|Japan]] and she continued writing throughout her life. Influenced by the renowned poet [[Matsuo Bashō]] but emerging and as independent figure with a unique voice in her own right, Chiyo-ni dedication toward her career not only paved a way for her career but it also opened a path for other women to follow. Chiyo-ni is known as a "forerunner, who played the role of encouraging international cultural exchange".<ref name="city.hakusan.ishikawa.jp">{{cite web|url=http://haikukan.city.hakusan.ishikawa.jp/english/about/|title=About Chiyo-Jo Haiku Museum - Chiyo-Jo Haiku Museum|website=haikukan.city.hakusan.ishikawa.jp}}</ref>

She is perhaps best known for this haiku:

{{quote|<poem>''morning glory!

Today, the [[morning glory]] is a favorite flower for the people of her home town, because she left a number of poems on that flower.<ref name="auto1">Patricia Donegan and Yoshie Ishibashi.

==Biography==
Chiyo-ni was born in [[Matto, Ishikawa|Matto]], [[Kaga Province]] (now [[Hakusan, Ishikawa|Hakusan]], [[Ishikawa Prefecture]]), in February 1703, the eldest daughter of a [[Hanging scroll|scroll mounter]]. At an early age, Chiyo-ni was introduced to art and poetry, and she began writing haiku poetry at the age of seven. By the age of seventeen, she had become very popular all over Japan for her poetry.

Her poems, although mostly dealing with [[nature]], work for a unity of nature with humanity. Her own life was that of the [[haikai]] poets who made their lives and the world they lived in one with themselves, living a simple and humble life. She was able to make connections by being observant and carefully studying the unique things around her ordinary world and writing them down.<ref name="auto"/>

At age twelve, Chiyo-ni's studied under two haiku poets who had themselves apprenticed with the great poet [[Matsuo Bashō]], and many in her time saw her as one of Bashō's true heirs, both in her poetry and in her humble attitude of warm awareness toward the world and her simple living. She studied Basho's style of writing poems in her early years, although she did develop on her own as an independent figure with her own unique voice.<ref name="auto"/>

She was well aware of being considered Bashō's heir and on a portrait of Bashō she wrote in [[calligraphy]]:

{{quote|<poem>To listen, 
fine not to listen, fine too... 
nightingale<ref>trans. Lenore Mayhew</ref>
</poem>}}

She appears to say that while she did listen to him, she also did not copy him, "not to listen, fine too."

In around 1720 she married a servant of the Fukuoka family of [[Kanazawa]], and had one child with him, a son, who died in infancy. Her husband died of disease not long after in 1722. She valued her independence too much, and despite her loneliness, she did not remarry, so she returned home to her parents.

It may be that after her husband's death Chiyo-ni lived with and cared for her elderly parents and worked in the families scroll mounting business. She wrote:

{{quote|<poem>parents older than I 
are now my children 
the same cicadas<ref>trans. Jane Reichhold</ref>
</poem>}}

After her parents died, she adopted a married couple to carry on the family business and in 1754, at the age of fifty-two (by [[East Asian age reckoning]]), Chiyo-ni chose to become a [[Buddhist nun]]. "Not", she said, "in order to renounce the world, but as a way 'to teach her heart to be like the clear water which flows night and day."<ref>Jane Hirshfield</ref> Chiyo-ni shaved her head and started to live in a temple with other nuns and took the [[Dharma name|Buddhist name]] Soen. She continued her writing and lived the rest of her simple yet peaceful life in the manner of [[haikai]].<ref name="auto1"/>

In 1764, she was chosen to prepare the official gift for [[Maeda Shigemichi]], the [[daimyō]] of her [[Kaga Domain|region]], to the [[Joseon missions to Japan#1764|Korean Delegation]] led by civil minister [[Jo Eom]]. Chiyo-ni crafted and delivered 21 artworks based on her twenty-one haiku.<ref name="city.hakusan.ishikawa.jp"/>

Chiyo-ni died in 1775.
