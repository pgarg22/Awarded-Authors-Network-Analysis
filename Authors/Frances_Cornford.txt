'''Frances Crofts Cornford''' (née '''Darwin'''; 30 March 1886 – 19 August 1960) was an English poet; because of the similarity of her first name, her father's and her husband's, she was known to her family before her marriage as "FCD" and after her marriage as "FCC" and her husband [[Francis Cornford]] was known as "FMC". Her father Sir [[Francis Darwin]], a son of [[Charles Darwin]], yet another 'Francis', was known to their family as "Frank", or as "Uncle Frank".

==Life==
She was the daughter of the [[botanist]] [[Francis Darwin]] and [[Newnham College, Cambridge|Newnham College]] fellow [[Ellen Wordsworth Darwin|Ellen Wordsworth Crofts]] (1856-1903), and born into the [[Darwin—Wedgwood family]].  She was a granddaughter of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[natural history|naturalist]] [[Charles Darwin]].  Her older half-brother was the golf writer [[Bernard Darwin]].  She was brought up in Cambridge, among a dense social network of aunts, uncles, and cousins, and was educated privately.<ref name="odnb">{{Cite ODNB|id=32570|title=Cornford [née Darwin], Frances Crofts}}</ref><ref>''[[Period Piece]]'', a memoir by Frances Cornford's first cousin and close friend, [[Gwen Raverat]], sheds much light on Cornford's childhood.</ref>

In 1909, Frances Darwin married [[Francis Cornford]], a classicist and poet. They had five children:
* Helena Cornford (1913–1996); married [[Joseph L. Henderson]]<ref>Jeremy Pearce, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/04/us/04henderson.html?_r=0 "Joseph L. Henderson, 104; Expanded Jungian Methods"], ''The New York Times''.</ref> in 1934
*[[John Cornford]] (1915–1936), a poet and Communist who was killed in the Spanish Civil War
*[[Christopher Cornford]] (1917–1993), an artist and writer
* Hugh Wordsworth Cornford (1921–1997), medical doctor<ref>[http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC1112870/#__secid318364title Flora Bridge · Barrie Alfred Ernest Chapman · Amiya Kumar Chatterjee · Hugh Wordsworth Cornford... - Europe PMC Article - Europe PubMed Central<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
* Ruth Clare (1924–1992); married Cecil Hall Chapman, the son of [[Sydney Chapman (mathematician)|Sydney Chapman]] in 1947.<ref>Marriages ''[[The Times]]'', Friday, 11 April 1947; p. 1; Issue 50732; col A.</ref> She was the mother of [[Matthew Chapman (author)|Matthew Chapman]]

She is buried at the [[Ascension Parish Burial Ground, Cambridge|Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground]] in Cambridge,<ref>[[Mark Goldie]], ''A Guide to Churchill College, Cambridge'', pp. 62 and 63 (2009).</ref> where she is in the same grave as her father [[Sir Francis Darwin]]. Her mother [[Ellen Wordsworth Darwin]], née Crofts, is buried in St. Andrews Church's churchyard in [[Girton, Cambridgeshire|Girton]], [[Cambridgeshire]].

Her husband, Francis, was cremated at Cambridge Crematorium on 6 January 1943.

==Works==
Frances Cornford published several books of verse, including her debut (as "F.C.D"), ''The Holtbury Idyll'' (1908), ''Poems'' (1910), ''Spring Morning'' (1915), ''Autumn Midnight'' (1923), and ''Different Days'' (1928).  ''Mountains and Molehills'' (1935) was illustrated with woodcuts by her cousin [[Gwen Raverat]].

She wrote poems including "The Guitarist Tunes Up":

<blockquote><poem>
With what attentive courtesy he bent
Over his instrument;
Not as a lordly conqueror who could
Command both wire and wood,
But as a man with a loved woman might
Inquiring with delight
What slight essential things she had to say
Before they started, he and she, to play.
</poem></blockquote>

One of Frances Cornford's poems was a favourite of [[Philip Larkin]] and his lover Maeve Brennan. "All Souls' Night" uses the superstition that a dead lover will appear to a still faithful partner on that November date. Maeve, many years after Larkin's death, would re-read the poem on [[All Souls' Day|All Souls]]:<ref name="larkin">{{cite news|last1=Ezard|first1=John|title=Revealed: Larkin the tender lover|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/oct/15/johnezard|access-date=13 April 2018|work=The Guardian|date=15 October 1999|language=en}}</ref>

<blockquote><poem>
My love came back to me
Under the November tree
Shelterless and dim.
He put his hand upon my shoulder,
He did not think me strange or older,
Nor I him.
</poem></blockquote>

Although the myth enhances the poem - it can be read as the meeting of older, former lovers.

To a Fat Lady Seen from the Train
However, Cornford is possibly best remembered for her [[triolet]] poem "To a Fat Lady Seen from the Train" in ''Poems'' of 1910.<ref name=sage>{{cite book|editor1=Sage, Lorna|editor-link=Lorna Sage|editor2=Germaine Greer|editor2-link=Germaine Greer|editor3=Elaine Showalter |editor3-link=Elaine Showalter |title=The Cambridge Guide to Women's Writing in English|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521668132|page=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgeguidedt0000unse/page/153 153]|url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgeguidedt0000unse|url-access=registration|quote=To a Fat Lady Seen from the Train cornford best known.}}</ref>
<blockquote><poem>
O why do you walk through the fields in gloves,
Missing so much and so much?
O fat white woman whom nobody loves,
Why do you walk through the fields in gloves,
When the grass is soft as the breast of doves
And shivering-sweet to the touch?
O why do you walk through the fields in gloves,
Missing so much and so much?
</poem></blockquote>

To which [[G. K. Chesterton]] replied in "The Fat Lady Answers" in his ''Collected Poems'' of 1927:<ref name=ahlquist>{{cite web|last=Ahlquist|first=Dale|title=The Collected Poems II|url=http://www.chesterton.org/discover-chesterton/chesterton-101/lecture-51/|work=Chesterton 101 lecture series|publisher=American Chesterton Society|access-date=7 November 2013}}</ref>
<blockquote><poem>
Why do you rush through the field in trains,
Guessing so much and so much.
Why do you flash through the flowery meads,
Fat-head poet that nobody reads;
And why do you know such a frightful lot
About people in gloves as such?
...
</poem></blockquote>

Earlier, in 1910, [[A. E. Housman]] had written a parody in a private letter:<ref name=housman>{{cite book|last=Housman|first=A..E.|editor=Archie Burnett|isbn=9780198184966|title=The Letters of A. E. Housman|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=249|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KDn58Jqn94wC&q=shoots&pg=PA249|date=29 March 2007}}</ref>
<blockquote><poem>
O why do you walk through the fields in boots,
Missing so much and so much?
O fat white woman whom nobody shoots,
Why do you walk through the fields in boots,
When the grass is soft as the breast of coots ...
</poem></blockquote>

The first lines of this poem were spoken by a character in [[Agatha Christie]]'s 1939 novel ''[[Murder is Easy]]''. 
<!-- NB Only a few are privileged to have actually stroked the breasts of white doves, and the son of the poet's godson is one of them. (NB Did Houseman ever feel a coot's breast? Also, Chesterton was out by at least 1.) -->
