== Career ==

=== Acting career ===
Mortensen's first film role was in ''[[The Purple Rose of Cairo]]'' (1985), but his scenes were deleted from the final cut. His first onscreen appearance was playing an [[Amish]] farmer in [[Peter Weir]]'s ''[[Witness (1985 film)|Witness]]''. He was cast in ''Witness'' because the director thought he had the right face for the part of an Amish man. He had also been simultaneously cast for another role as a soldier in [[Shakespeare in the Park (New York City)|Shakespeare in the Park's]] production of ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', but he decided to choose acting in the film because he wanted to try something new. He credited that decision and the very positive experience on the film as the start of his film career.<ref name="dvdextra">{{cite AV media |people=Keith Clark and Jon Mefford |year=2005 |title=Witness |chapter=Between Two Worlds: The Making of ''Witness'' |medium=DVD |publisher=Paramount Pictures |oclc=949729643}}</ref> 

Also in 1985, he was cast in the role of Bragg on the TV series ''[[Search for Tomorrow]]''. Mortensen's 1987 performance in ''[[Bent (play)|Bent]]'' at the [[Coast Playhouse]], Los Angeles, won him a Dramalogue Critics' Award. The play, about homosexual prisoners in a [[concentration camp]],  was known for the leading performance by [[Ian McKellen]]. Mortensen later costarred with him in the film trilogy ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]''. In 1987, Mortensen guest starred as a police detective on the hit TV series ''[[Miami Vice]].''

During the 1990s, Mortensen appeared in supporting roles in a variety of films, including [[Jane Campion]]'s ''[[The Portrait of a Lady (film)|The Portrait of a Lady]]'', ''[[Young Guns II]]'', ''[[Prison (1988 film)|Prison]]'', ''[[Boiling Point (1993 film)|Boiling Point]]'', ''[[Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III]]'', [[Sean Penn]]'s ''[[The Indian Runner]]'', [[Danny Cannon]]'s ''[[The Young Americans (film)|The Young Americans]]'', [[Carl Colpaert]]'s ''The Crew'', which won the São Paulo Film Festival Audience Award, Brian de Palma's ''[[Carlito's Way]]'',  ''[[Crimson Tide (film)|Crimson Tide]]'', ''[[G.I. Jane]]'', ''[[Daylight (1996 film)|Daylight]]'', ''[[A Walk on the Moon]]'', ''American Yakuza'', Charles Robert Carner's remake ''Vanishing Point'', [[Philip Ridley]]'s films ''[[The Reflecting Skin]]'' and ''[[The Passion of Darkly Noon]]'', the remake films ''[[A Perfect Murder]]'' and [[Gus Van Sant]]'s ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (the 1998 remakes of two [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s movies ''[[Dial M for Murder]]'' and ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''), ''[[28 Days (film)|28 Days]]'', and ''[[The Prophecy]]'', with [[Christopher Walken]]. Of these roles, Mortensen was probably best known for playing Master Chief John Urgayle in ''[[G.I. Jane]]''.<ref>{{cite news |first=Stephen |last=Applebaum |title=Mortensen's battle scars |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2544149.stm |work=BBC News |date=December 5, 2002 |access-date=August 26, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040619150324/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2544149.stm |archive-date=June 19, 2004 |url-status=live}}</ref>

[[File:ViggoMortensen.jpg|thumb|upright|Mortensen at the premiere of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', December 1, 2003]]
Another major mainstream breakthrough came in 1999, when [[Peter Jackson]] cast him as [[Aragorn]] in [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]]. According to the Special Extended Edition DVD of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', Mortensen was a last-minute replacement for [[Stuart Townsend]], and would not have taken the part of Aragorn had it not been for his son's enthusiasm for the [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] novel. In ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]'' DVD extras, the film's swordmaster, [[Bob Anderson (fencer)|Bob Anderson]], described Mortensen as "the best swordsman I've ever trained." Mortensen often performed his own stunts, and even the injuries he sustained during several of them did not dampen his enthusiasm. At one point during shooting of ''The Two Towers'', Mortensen, [[Orlando Bloom]], and Brett Beattie (stunt double for [[John Rhys-Davies]]) all had painful injuries, and during a shoot of them, running in the mountains, [[Peter Jackson]] jokingly referred to the three as "the walking wounded."
Also, according to the Special Extended Edition DVD of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', Mortensen purchased the two horses, Uraeus and Kenny, whom he rode and bonded with over the duration of the films. He received critical acclaim for his portrayal of Aragorn, and was ranked No. 15 on a 2015 survey of "The 100 Greatest Movie Characters" conducted by ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]''.<ref>[https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/100-greatest-movie-characters/ "The 100 Greatest Movie Characters"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329121320/http://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/100-greatest-movie-characters/ |date=March 29, 2016 }}.

In 2004, Mortensen starred as [[Frank Hopkins]] in ''[[Hidalgo (film)|Hidalgo]]'', the story of an ex-army courier who travels to Arabia to compete with his horse, Hidalgo, in a dangerous desert race for a contest prize.

In 2005, Mortensen starred in [[David Cronenberg]]'s movie ''[[A History of Violence (film)|A History of Violence]]'' as a family man revealed to have had an unsavory previous career. He was nominated for a Satellite Award for Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture for this role. In the DVD extras for ''A History of Violence'', Cronenberg related that Mortensen is the only actor he had come across who would come back from weekends with his family with items he had bought to use as props on the set.

In 2006, he starred as Captain Diego Alatriste in the Spanish language film ''[[Alatriste]]'', based on the series of novels ''[[Captain Alatriste|The Adventures of Captain Alatriste]]'', written by the Spanish writer [[Arturo Pérez-Reverte]].

In September 2007, the film ''[[Eastern Promises]]'', directed by David Cronenberg, was released to critical acclaim for the film itself and for Mortensen's performance as a Russian gangster on the rise in London. His nude fight scene in a steam room was applauded by [[Roger Ebert]]: "Years from now, it will be referred to as a benchmark."<ref name="rogerebert">[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070913/REVIEWS/709130303/-1/EDITOR "Eastern Promises"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003110500/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20070913%2FREVIEWS%2F709130303%2F-1%2FEDITOR |date=October 3, 2012 }}.

=== Visual arts and discography ===
Mortensen is a painter and photographer. His paintings are frequently [[abstract art|abstract]] and often contain fragments of his poetry therein. His paintings have been featured in galleries worldwide, and many of the paintings of the artist he portrayed in ''[[A Perfect Murder]]'' are his own.

Mortensen experiments with his poetry and music by mixing the two art forms. He has collaborated with guitarist [[Buckethead]] on several albums, mostly released on his own label (Perceval Press) or TDRS Music. Viggo was first introduced to Buckethead's work while working on sounds for an educational CD on Greek mythology. The finished product included a guitar part by Buckethead, which caught Viggo's ear and led him to initiate contact with the guitarist. The collaboration grew from there.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://music.ign.com/articles/496/496645p1.html |title=Viggo & Buckethead", March 5, 2004, IGN Music |access-date=August 11, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724093429/http://music.ign.com/articles/496/496645p1.html |archive-date=July 24, 2008}}</ref>
