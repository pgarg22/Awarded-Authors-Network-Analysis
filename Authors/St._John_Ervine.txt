'''St John Greer Ervine''' (28 December 1883 – 24 January 1971) was an Irish biographer, novelist, critic, dramatist, and theatre manager.<ref name="ce">{{cite encyclopedia |first=Rebecca |last=Steinberger |title=Ervine, St. John |editor1-first=Gabrielle H |editor1-last=Cody |editor2-first=Evert |editor2-last=Sprinchorn |encyclopedia=The Columbia Encyclopedia of Modern Drama |location=New York |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2007 |page=247 |isbn=978-0-231-14032-4 }}</ref> He was the most prominent Ulster writer of the early twentieth century and a major Irish dramatist whose work influenced the plays of W.B. Yeats and Sean O'Casey.

==Biography==
Ervine was born as '''John Greer Irvine''' in [[Ballymacarrett]] in east Belfast, in the shadow of the shipyards, to deaf-mute parents. Every member of his family had been born in County Down for 300 years. His father, a printer, died soon after his birth and the family moved in with Ervine's grandmother who ran a small shop. Ervine became an insurance clerk in a Belfast office at the age of 17 and shortly after he moved to London.<ref name="Turnpike"/>

In London Ervine met [[George Bernard Shaw]] and began to write journalism as well as his first plays, adopting the name St John Ervine "as more fitting for his ambitions". His first full-length play, ''Mixed Marriage'', was produced by Dublin's [[Abbey Theatre]] in 1911. It had several runs as one of the Abbey's most profitable plays. W.B. Yeats praised Ervine's plays for depicting the real life experienced by the people of the north of Ireland as Synge's work had done for those of the west of Ireland.<ref name="Turnpike"/>

In June 1913, Ervine was standing beside [[Emily Davison]] at [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]] and witnessed her being fatally injured by [[King George V]]'s horse.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/suffragettes/8317.shtml|title=BBC - Archive - Suffragettes - Time to Remember - The 1913 Derby|work=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

In 1915 W.B. Yeats appointed Ervine as the Abbey's general manager.<ref>https://www.abbeytheatre.ie/archives/person_detail/14780/</ref> Ervine's tenure was a commercial success. The production of several successful comedies restored the theatre's finances. But Ervine's demands on the actors, combined with his outrage at the [[Easter Rising]] of 1916, led to open conflict. Ervine resigned from the Abbey in 1916 and enlisted in the [[Household Battalion]]. On 1 January 1917 he was commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant in the second reserve of the [[Royal Dublin Fusiliers]],<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=30249|supp=y|page=8782|date=24 August 1917}}</ref> and was transferred to a regular battalion on 1 August 1917.<ref>{{London Gazette|nolink=y|issue=30938|supp=4|page=11805|date=7 October 1918}}</ref> After being wounded in Flanders one of his legs had to be amputated. He was promoted to lieutenant on 1 February 1919 and relinquished his commission due to his wounds on 5 December 1919.<ref>{{London Gazette|nolink=y|issue=31772|supp=2|page=1665|date=9 February 1920}} Substituted for notice in {{London Gazette|nolink=y|issue=31673|supp=4|page=15402|date=4 December 1919}}</ref>

Through the 1920s and 1930s Ervine wrote drawing-room comedies that were box-office successes. Several had West End runs of up to two years, among them ''Anthony and Anna'' (1926) and ''[[The First Mrs. Fraser (play)|The First Mrs. Fraser]]'' (1929).<ref name="ce" /> In 1936 Ervine's ''Boyd's Shop'', "the play that defined Northern Irish drama for decades", was produced.<ref name="Turnpike"/> Arnold Bennett hailed him as a playwright "unequalled" in England, with plays that "combined great skill, fine ideals, and perfect sincerity with immense popular success".<ref name="Lothian">{{cite journal |last1=Lothian |first1=Alice |title=Plays and Novels of St. John Ervine |journal=The North American Review |date=May 1922 |volume=215 |issue=798 |page=645 |jstor=25121038 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/25121038 |access-date=21 October 2020}}</ref> From 1919 to 1939 Ervine was also a theatre reviewer for ''[[The Observer]]''.

Alongside his plays Ervine wrote a number of novels. Of these the most successful, ''The Wayward Man'' (1927), was reprinted in 1936 as one of [[Allen Lane]]'s first Penguin paperbacks (Penguin 32). He also produced several major biographies, including of the [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionist]] leaders [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|Craigavon]] and [[Edward Carson|Carson]], of [[William Booth]], of [[Oscar Wilde]] and of [[George Bernard Shaw]]. ''Bernard Shaw: His Life, Work, and Friends'' (1956) was awarded the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] in 1956.<ref>http://www.ed.ac.uk/events/james-tait-black/winners/biography</ref>

Explaining the determination of his character Robert "Darkie" Dunwoody in his novel, ''The Wayward Man'', to leave the city despite the ties that bind him, Ervine wrote "I have never met anyone who was not depressed by Belfast".<ref name="Craig">{{cite news |last1=Craig |first1=Patricia |title=St John Ervine's 'A Wayward Man': the rediscovery of a Northern Irish writer |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/st-john-ervine-s-a-wayward-man-the-rediscovery-of-a-northern-irish-writer-1.1949362 |access-date=21 October 2020 |work=The Irish Times |publisher=The Irish Times |date=6 October 2014}}</ref> [[Sean O'Faolain]] accounted Ervine "the only Belfast writer who has tried at all to bottle the 'realism' of the city". He suggested, however, that, "lacking poetry", Ervine "only succeeded in making it taste like reboiled mutton gone cold".<ref>{{cite book |last1=O'Faolain |first1=Sean |title=An Irish Journey |date=1940 |publisher=Browne & Nolan |location=Dublin |page=264}}</ref>

As "part of what might be called a programme for the reinstatement of certain neglected Northern Irish novelists", The Wayward Man was republished in 2014. [[Patricia Craig (writer)|Patricia Craig]] proposes that it is an exemplar of "a kind of Edwardian realism nurtured in the shade of [[Arnold Bennett]] and [[John Galsworthy]], and embodying a distinctive Ulster Protestant strain".<ref name="Craig" />

By the 1940s St John Ervine was Northern Ireland's leading writer but also a controversial figure with “a remarkable antipathy to southern Ireland".<ref name="Turnpike"/> He died in 1971.
