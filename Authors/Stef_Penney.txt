'''Stef Penney''' (born 1969 in Edinburgh) is a Scottish filmmaker and novelist.

She grew up in the Scottish capital and turned to film-making after a degree in Philosophy and Theology from [[Bristol University]]. She made three short films before studying Film and TV at [[Bournemouth College of Art]], and on graduation was selected for the [[Carlton Television]] New Writers Scheme. She has also written and directed two short films; a BBC 10 x 10 starring [[Anna Friel]] and a [[Film Council]] Digital Short in 2002 starring [[Lucy Russell (actress)|Lucy Russell]].<ref name=AuthorInfo>{{cite web|last=Penney|first=Stef|title=About the Author|url=http://www.stefpenney.com/about-the-author.html|publisher=stefpenney.com}}</ref>

She won the [[2006 Costa Book Awards]] and The Book-of-the-Month Club First Fiction Award with her [[debut novel]] ''[[The Tenderness of Wolves (novel)|The Tenderness of Wolves]],'' which is set in Canada in the 1860s. The novel starts with the discovery of the murder of a trapper, and then follows various events that occur as the murderer is sought. As Stef Penney suffered from [[agoraphobia]] at the time of writing this novel, she did all the research in the [[library|libraries]] of London and never visited Canada.<ref name=Independent>{{cite web|last=House|first=Christian|title=When among Roma, do as the Roma do Stef Penney reluctantly tells Christian House how she researched her gypsy thriller follow-up to 'The Tenderness of Wolves'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/when-among-roma-do-as-the-roma-do-2348779.html|work=The Independent|accessdate=20 October 2013|date=4 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/costa2006/story/0,,2009239,00.html|location=London|work=The Guardian|first=Stephen|last=Moss|title=Leave me alone|date=9 February 2007}}</ref>
