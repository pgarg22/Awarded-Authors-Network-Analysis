'''Joel Rosenberg''' (May 1, 1954 &ndash; June 2, 2011) was a [[Canadian American]] [[science fiction author|science fiction]] and [[fantasy authors|fantasy author]] best known for his long-running "[[Guardians of the Flame]]" series.  Rosenberg was also a gun rights activist. He is the oldest brother of ''[[The Miami Herald|Miami Herald]]'' reporter [[Carol Rosenberg]].

== Writing career ==
Rosenberg began publishing in 1978 with an [[op-ed]] piece in ''[[The New York Times]]'' favoring [[nuclear power]]. His stories appeared in ''[[Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine]]'', ''[[Amazing Stories|Amazing Science Fiction]]'', and TSR's ''[[Dragon (magazine)|The Dragon]]''. His novels have been published by Roc, Avon, Berkley, Tor and [[Baen Books]].

=== Fantasy ===
His first published fiction, "Like the Gentle Rains", appeared in ''[[Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine]]'' in 1982.  The following year, he published his first novel, ''The Sleeping Dragon'', which was the first in his long-running [[Guardians of the Flame]] series.  This series placed a group of college students into a [[fantasy]] setting similar to a [[role-playing game|role-playing world]].  Throughout the series' ten novels, Rosenberg traced these characters, their descendants, and the changes they made to society.  He showed no compunction about killing off popular characters.

The "Keepers of the Hidden Ways" trilogy similarly placed people from the real world into a fantasy setting, making heavy use of [[Norse mythology]].  A third fantasy series, consisting of the novels ''D'Shai'' (1991) and ''Hour of the Octopus'' (1994) (both lightly humorous mysteries), was set in an Asian-influenced fantasy world with very strict cultural standards and etiquette.

''Paladins'', the first in his "Mordred's Heirs" series, was published by Baen Books in September 2004; the second, ''Knight Moves'', was published in November 2006.  This series, an "alternate fantasy history", takes place in a world where [[Mordred]] defeated [[King Arthur]], establishing the [[Pendragon]] Dynasty.

=== Science fiction ===
In addition to fantasy, Rosenberg wrote a number of science fiction novels.  Although dealing with different characters, ''Ties of Blood and Silver'' (1984) and ''Emile and the Dutchman'' (1986) both take place in the same setting.  Two other books in this setting, ''Not for Glory'' (1988) and ''Hero'' (1990), focus on family members of the Metzadan Mercenary Corps from the [[Jew]]ish- (and others-) settled World of Metzada ([[Masada]]).

=== Mysteries ===
In the early years of the 21st century, Rosenberg turned his hand to mysteries, publishing ''Home Front'', the first of his "Sparky Hemingway" mysteries in 2003; the second, ''Family Matters'', was published in early 2004.

=== Themes and influences ===
Rosenberg's novels frequently featured the theme of [[liberty|freedom]], particularly in the Guardians of the Flame series, where the initial characters make it their life's goal to abolish [[slavery]] in their new world, and the [[right to arms|right to keep and bear arms]]. Other themes included protecting children at all costs, and the message that people can overcome hardships and abuse suffered as children.

His heroes also frequently find inspiration in the heroic figures of the [[Greek literature|Greek classics]] and of American [[folklore]] and [[History of the United States|history]].

== Gun rights advocate ==
Outside of science fiction, Rosenberg was best known as a [[handgun]] instructor, [[gun rights]] advocate, and author of a manual for people wanting to get a handgun carry permit in [[Minnesota]], ''Everything You Need to Know About (Legally) Carrying a Handgun in Minnesota'', and a similar book for [[Missouri]], ''Everything You Need to Know About (Legally) Carrying a Handgun in Missouri''.  His wife recounted that Rosenberg's experience with gun rights was inadvertent. In an interview following his death, she said a [[neo-Nazi]] threatened Rosenberg and his family via emails—specifically enough to describe his home—and Rosenberg decided to seek a permit to carry to protect himself.

<blockquote>Rosenberg once suspected that the threats might have something to do with his Metzada novels—"I do write about Jews in space with big guns." But to this day, he doesn't know anything about his stalker, except that he or she is violently anti-Semitic, and unlikely to win any spelling bees.<ref name="hello-arms" /></blockquote>

The legal back and forth between Rosenberg and the Minneapolis police department prompted him to push for a change in the law, from a "may issue" statute to a "shall issue" statute.

While his books of the [[Guardians of the Flame]] series have detailed descriptions of firearm technology, he began seriously dealing with self-defense issues after he thwarted a [[Burglary|break-in]] into his house with a [[.22 LR]] pistol he kept in his home.<ref name="hello-arms" />

=== Arrest for carrying a handgun ===
In November 2010, Rosenberg openly wore a holstered handgun when coming into the [[Minneapolis]] [[city hall]] for a meeting with a representative of the city's [[police chief]] after providing prior notification as required by state law. After arrival, he was told that a [[court order]] prohibited people from carrying a gun anywhere in the building, which houses family and small claims courtrooms on the third floor. He objected, citing [[Gun laws in the United States (by state)#Minnesota|the state gun laws]], and avoided arrest when he agreed to carry his gun (which the police had confiscated, emptied of ammunition, and returned to him) back to his car. He subsequently filed a complaint against the police sergeant, and posted a [[YouTube]] video displaying how many weapons can be concealed on one's body.<ref>{{YouTube|Kq85OgcZ0Co}}</ref>

In December 2010, he was charged with possession of a dangerous weapon in a courthouse, a [[felony]], and [[contempt of court]], a [[misdemeanor]], arrested, and jailed in lieu of $100,000 [[bail bond|bond]].<ref>[http://www.startribune.com/local/111568954.html?elr=KArksLckD8EQDUoaEyqyP4O:DW3ckUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aUvckD8EQDUT Lonetree, Anthony.

== Personal life and death ==
A native of Winnipeg, he grew up in [[Northwood, North Dakota]], and later moved with his parents and family to Connecticut.<ref name=AA>{{cite web |website=Mprnews.org|url=http://blogs.mprnews.org/cities/2011/06/joel-rosenberg-the-accidental-activist/|title=Joel Rosenberg, 'accidental activist'|author=Nelson, Tim |date=June 6, 2011}}</ref>  He had a Canadian mother and American father—he enjoyed dual Canadian and American citizenship.

He attended the University of Connecticut, where he met and married Felicia Herman. He studied to be a social worker and counselor, but took to writing after discussing the fantasy role-playing game ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'' with a friend. Rosenberg's occupations, before settling down to writing full-time, included truck driving, care work, bookkeeping, gambling, motel desk-clerking, and cooking. Hobbies included backgammon, poker, bridge, as well as cooking.

In an interview following his death, his wife recalled how he came to write his most famous novel series, ''The Guardians of the Flame'':

{{quote|He said, "Boy I'd really love to be in the world of my game." And Joel literally woke up in the middle of the night and said, "Like hell you would. This is what it would really be like." And that's how he got the inspiration for starting his best known series, the Guardian of the Flame, in which a group of college-aged gamers are transported to the world of their game and they didn't like it as much as they thought they would ... It was basically a million-word love letter to the industrial revolution.<ref name=AA/>}}

Herman said Rosenberg was a diabetic, but otherwise in good health. She said he suddenly collapsed and never really recovered, despite efforts to resuscitate him. Rosenberg died June 2, 2011, after a sudden [[respiratory depression]] caused a heart attack, brain damage and major organ failures.<ref>[[Steven H Silver|Silver, Steven H]].

His wife, Felicia G. Herman, posted on her blog, "In accordance with his wishes, he shared the gift of life through organ and tissue donation."<ref>[https://archive.today/20120720082100/http://fgherman.livejournal.com/41929.html Herman, Felicia G. "Joel Rosenberg - husband, father, mensch"], June 3, 2011</ref> He is survived by his children, Judith and Jimbo, and his wife Felicia.
