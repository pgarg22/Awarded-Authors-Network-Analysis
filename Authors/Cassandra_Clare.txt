Clare was born Judith Rumelt to American parents in [[Tehran]], Iran. She is the daughter of [[Richard Rumelt]], a business school professor and author.<ref name=Kaplan/> Her maternal grandfather was film producer [[Max Rosenberg]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/jun/22/guardianobituaries.film|title=Obituary: Max Rosenberg|last=Reed|first=Christopher|date=June 22, 2004|website=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=June 26, 2018}}</ref> Clare is Jewish, and has described her family as "not religious".<ref>{{cite web|last=Clare|first=Cassandara|title=The first chapter of City of Fallen Angels (and POV)|url=http://cassandraclare.livejournal.com/49925.html?thread=4033541#t4033541|date=February 27, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Kids' Q&A Cassandra Clare|url=http://www.powells.com/kidsqa/clare.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815055926/http://www.powells.com/kidsqa/clare.html|archive-date=August 15, 2012}}</ref>

As a child, Clare traveled frequently, spending time in Switzerland, England, and France. She returned to Los Angeles for high school, and from then on split her time between [[California]] and [[New York City]], where she worked at various entertainment magazines and tabloids, including ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ebookstore.sony.com/ebook/cassandra-claire/mortal-instruments-trilogy-sample-of-the-citys/_/R-400000000000000168871 |title=Author's bio at Sony.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005080729/http://ebookstore.sony.com/ebook/cassandra-claire/mortal-instruments-trilogy-sample-of-the-citys/_/R-400000000000000168871 |archive-date=October 5, 2011 }}</ref>

While living in Los Angeles, Clare began writing [[fan fiction]] using the name Cassandra Claire. ''The Draco Trilogy'', based on ''[[Harry Potter]]'', and ''The Very Secret Diaries'', based on ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', were popular.<ref name="timesonline">{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article782039.ece?token=null&offset=12&page=2|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120709050010/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article782039.ece?token=null&offset=12&page=2|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 9, 2012|title=The Times article on The Draco Trilogy}}</ref><ref name="lookingglassreview">{{cite web|url=http://lookingglassreview.com/html/cassandra_clare.html|title=Author's Bio at LookingGlassReview.com}}</ref> However, she deleted her fan fiction from the Internet shortly before her first novel, ''The City of Bones'', was published under the name Cassandra Clare.<ref name=WSJ-June-2012 />

She is also friends with author [[Holly Black]], and their books occasionally overlap, Clare mentioning characters from Black's novels and vice versa, such as Val and Luis from Black's ''Valiant''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cassandraclare.com/cms/faqs#valiant|title= Is that Val and Luis from Holly Black's Valiant in that scene in City of Bones where Jace and Clary are going downtown with the Silent Brother?|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411004931/http://www.cassandraclare.com/cms/faqs#valiant|archive-date=April 11, 2011}}</ref>

Clare is also credited by her publisher with creating the "''City of Fallen Angels'' treatment" where a tangible "letter" from one character to another is attached to the back of physical copies of a book. The goal is to spur print book sales.<ref name="Kaplan">{{cite news|last=Kaplan|first=David A.|title=A most unusual father-daughter professional pairing|url=http://features.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/2012/08/29/cassandra-clare-richard-rumelt/|newspaper=CNN Money|date=August 29, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830091743/http://features.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/2012/08/29/cassandra-clare-richard-rumelt/|archive-date=August 30, 2012}}</ref>

In 2016, [[The Guardian]] reported that Clare was being sued by [[Sherrilyn Kenyon]] for 'wilfully copying' her novels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/10/sherrilyn-kenyon-sues-cassandra-clare-for-wilfully-copying-her-novels|title = Sherrilyn Kenyon sues Cassandra Clare for 'wilfully copying' her novels|date = February 10, 2016}}</ref>

''City of Bones'' was released by [[Simon & Schuster]] in 2007 and is a contemporary fantasy story revolving around characters [[Clary Fray]], [[Jace Wayland]], and Simon Lewis, which became a ''[[The New York Times]]'' bestseller upon its release.
