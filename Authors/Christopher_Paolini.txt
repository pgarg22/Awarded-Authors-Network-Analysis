==Early life==
Paolini was born in Los Angeles, California, and raised in the area of [[Paradise Valley, Montana]]. His family members include his parents, Kenneth Paolini and Talita Paolini, and his younger sister, Angela Paolini. Home schooled for the duration of his education, Paolini graduated from high school at the age of 15 through a set of accredited [[correspondence course]]s from the [[American School of Correspondence]] in [[Lansing, Illinois]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2014/11/10/the-education-of-a-best-selling-teenage-author/?noredirect=on|title=The education of a best-selling teenage author|last=Strauss|first=Valerie|date=November 10, 2014|work=The Washington Post|access-date=20 February 2019}}</ref>

==Career==
Following his high school graduation, he started his work on what would become the novel ''[[Eragon]]'', the first of a four-book [[The Inheritance Cycle|series]] set in the mythical land of [[Alagaësia]].

In 2002, ''Eragon'' was published for the first time by Paolini International LLC, Paolini's parents' publishing company. To promote the book, Paolini toured over 135 schools and libraries, discussing reading and writing, all the while dressed in "a medieval costume of red shirt, billowy black pants, lace-up boots, and a jaunty black cap." He drew the cover art for the first edition of ''Eragon'', which featured [[List of Inheritance Cycle characters#Saphira|Saphira]]'s eye, along with the maps on the inside covers of his books.<ref>Paolini, C., ''Eragon'', Paolini International LLC, 2002.</ref>

In mid-2002, the stepson of author [[Carl Hiaasen]] found ''Eragon'' in a bookstore and loved it; this led to Hiaasen bringing it to the attention of his publisher, [[Alfred A. Knopf]].<ref name="guardian">{{cite news| last = Spring| first = Kit| title = Elf and efficiency (Interview)| work = Guardian Unlimited| date = January 25, 2004| url = http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/childrenandteens/story/0,,1130351,00.html| access-date = 2007-09-13}}</ref><ref>David Welch (September 29, 2005).

The second edition of ''Eragon'' was published by Knopf in August 2003. At the age of nineteen, Paolini became a [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times''-bestselling]] author.<ref>Liz Rosenberg (November 16, 2003).

In December 2006, [[Fox 2000]] released the [[Eragon (film)|film adaptation]] of ''Eragon'' in theaters around the world. It received mostly negative reviews from critics,<ref>[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/eragon "Eragon (2006)"]. [[Rotten Tomatoes]].

Paolini's essay "It All Began with Books" was included in the April 2005 anthology ''[[Guys Write for Guys Read]]''.

''[[Eldest]]'', the sequel to ''Eragon'', was released August 23, 2005. The third book in the cycle, ''[[Brisingr]]'', was released on September 20, 2008. Although ''The Inheritance Cycle'' was originally planned as a trilogy, a fourth book, ''[[Inheritance (Paolini novel)|Inheritance]]'', was released on November 8, 2011 in the US, Australia, New Zealand, the EU, and India, and was subsequently translated and published in fifty-three countries. ''The Inheritance Cycle'' has sold more than 35 million copies.

On December 31, 2018, ''[[The Fork, the Witch, and the Worm]]'', the first book in a series called ''Tales of Alagaësia'', was published and released to the public.

Paolini's new science fiction novel, ''[[To Sleep in a Sea of Stars]]'', was released on September 15, 2020, by [[Tor Books]]. He also plans to return to the world of Alagaësia with a fifth book when he finishes his science-fiction book.<ref>Paolini, Christopher (May 18, 2016).

==Influences==
Paolini's literary inspirations include the works of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] and [[E.R. Eddison]], as well as the [[epic poem]] ''[[Beowulf]]''.<ref name="guardian" /> Paolini has said that ''Eragon'' was "specifically inspired" by ''[[Jeremy Thatcher, Dragon Hatcher]]'', by [[Bruce Coville]].<ref name="QandA" /> Other literary influences include [[David Eddings]],<ref name="QandA" /> [[Andre Norton]],<ref name="QandA" /> [[Brian Jacques]],<ref name="QandA" /> [[Anne McCaffrey]],<ref name="QandA" /> [[Raymond E.

Nature influences much of Paolini's writing. In an interview with [[Philip Pullman]] and [[Tamora Pierce]], Paolini said that [[Paradise Valley, Montana]] is "one of the main sources" of his inspiration.

In the acknowledgments of ''[[Brisingr]]'', Paolini acknowledged the influence of Leon and Hiroko Kapp's ''The Craft of the Japanese Sword'' for his description of the forging of [[Eragon (character)|Eragon]]'s [[Brisingr|sword]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Paolini | first = Christopher

It wouldn't mean anything to you anyway."}}</ref>

The experience of homelearning was a powerful influence on Paolini’s literary development. The author wrote, “Eragon would not exist if I had gone to public school. Homeschooling gave me the opportunity to pursue my own interests, time to dream, and time to write. And I had freedoms the majority of today’s teens don’t have. I didn’t have to contend with peer pressure to conform to social fads. I could be myself. Without the frantic schedule kept by many teens, I had time to think, to daydream about adventures, to create the world of Alagaésia.”

Paolini adds, “Weekly trips to the library were part of our routine. My sister and I became voracious readers, leaving the library every week with our arms filled with teetering towers of books.”

“My parents read to my sister and me, usually in the evenings. That was how I was introduced to Jane Austen and Charles Dickens. Hearing those books read out loud helped give me a feel for the English language, as well as solidify my love for books.”

==Reception==
Paolini's books have sold very well and have topped the charts of ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[USA Today]]'', and ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' bestsellers lists.<ref>{{cite news|title=USA Today Best-Selling Books|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/best-selling/week/2011/46/|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|year=2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=The New York Times Best-Sellers: Children's Books|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/12/books/bestseller/bestchildren.html?_r=0|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 12, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Publishers Weekly Best-Sellers|newspaper=[[Publishers Weekly]]|date=November 28, 2011}}</ref>
