'''Elizabeth Bishop''' (February 8, 1911 – October 6, 1979) was an [[American people|American]] poet and short-story writer. She was [[Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress]] from 1949 to 1950, the [[Pulitzer Prize]] winner for Poetry in 1956,<ref name=pulitzer/> the [[National Book Award]] winner in 1970, and the recipient of the [[Neustadt International Prize for Literature]] in 1976.<ref name=nba1970/> Dwight Garner argued that she was perhaps "the most purely gifted poet of the 20th century."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/20/books/review/nobel-prize-literature-critics-discussion.html?ribbon-ad-idx=4&rref=books&module=Ribbon&version=context&region=Header&action=click&contentCollection=Books&pgtype=article|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature Takes This Year Off.

==Early life==
Elizabeth Bishop, an only child, was born in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], United States, to William Thomas and Gertrude May (Bulmer) Bishop. After her father, a successful builder, died when she was eight months old, Bishop's mother became mentally ill and was institutionalized in 1916 (Bishop would later write about the time of her mother's struggles in her short story "In the Village.")<ref Name="ParisR">[http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/3229/the-art-of-poetry-no-27-elizabeth-bishop "Elizabeth Bishop, The Art of Poetry No. 27"] Interview in ''Paris Review'' Summer 1981 No. 80</ref> Effectively orphaned during her very early childhood, she lived with her maternal grandparents on a farm in [[Great Village, Nova Scotia]], a period she also referred to in her writing. Bishop's mother remained in an asylum until her death in 1934, and the two were never reunited.<ref>{{cite web | title = Elizabeth Bishop | work = Worcester Area Writers | publisher = Worcester Polytechnic Institute | url = http://www.wpi.edu/Academics/Library/Archives/WAuthors/bishop/bio.html | access-date = April 25, 2008 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080905051140/http://www.wpi.edu/Academics/Library/Archives/WAuthors/bishop/bio.html | archive-date = September 5, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>

Later in childhood, Bishop's paternal family gained custody. She was removed from the care of her grandparents and moved in with her father's wealthier family in Worcester, Massachusetts. However, Bishop was unhappy there, and her separation from her maternal grandparents made her lonely. While she was living in Worcester, she developed chronic asthma, from which she suffered for the rest of her life.<ref Name="ParisR"/> Her time in Worcester is briefly chronicled in her poem "In The Waiting Room." In 1918, her grandparents, realizing that Bishop was unhappy living with them, sent her to live with her mother's oldest sister, Maude Bulmer Shepherdson, and her husband George. The Bishops paid Maude to house and educate their granddaughter. The Shepherdsons lived in a [[tenement]] in an impoverished [[Revere, Massachusetts]] neighborhood populated mostly by Irish and Italian immigrants. The family later moved to better circumstances in [[Saugus, Massachusetts|Cliftondale, Massachusetts]]. It was Bishop's aunt who introduced her to the works of Victorian poets, including [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]], [[Thomas Carlyle]], [[Robert Browning]], and [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]].<ref name=Millier>{{cite book|last=Millier|first=Brett C.|title=Elizabeth Bishop: Life and the Memory of It|year=1995|publisher=University of California Press|isbn= 9780520203457 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SWdngGZv3cYC&pg=PA29}}</ref>

Bishop was very ill as a child and, as a result, received very little formal schooling until she attended [[Saugus High School (Massachusetts)|Saugus High School]] for her freshman year. She was accepted to the [[Walnut Hill School]] in [[Natick, Massachusetts]] for her sophomore year but was behind on her [[vaccinations]] and not allowed to attend. Instead she spent the year at the North Shore Country Day School in [[Beverly, Massachusetts]].<ref name=Millier /> Bishop then boarded at the Walnut Hill School, where she studied music.<ref Name="ParisR"/> At the school her first poems were published by her friend Frani Blough in a student magazine.<ref>{{cite web| title = Elizabeth Bishop| publisher = Walnut Hill School| url = http://www.walnuthillarts.org/creative_writing/elizabeth_bishop.html| access-date = April 25, 2008| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080509144238/http://www.walnuthillarts.org/creative_writing/elizabeth_bishop.html| archive-date = May 9, 2008| df = mdy-all}}</ref> Then she entered [[Vassar College]] in Poughkeepsie, New York in the fall of 1929, shortly before the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|stock market crash]], planning to be a composer. She gave up music because of a terror of performance and switched to English where she took courses including 16th and 17th century literature and the novel.<ref Name="ParisR"/> Bishop published her work in her senior year in ''The Magazine'' (based in California).<ref Name="ParisR"/> In 1933, she co-founded ''Con Spirito'', a rebel [[literary magazine]] at Vassar, with writer [[Mary McCarthy (author)|Mary McCarthy]] (one year her senior), Margaret Miller, and the sisters Eunice and [[Eleanor Clark]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Elizabeth Bishop, American Poet | work = Elizabeth Bishop Society | publisher = Vassar College | url = http://projects.vassar.edu/bishop/ | access-date = April 25, 2008 }}</ref>  Bishop graduated from Vassar with a bachelor's degree in 1934.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/elizabeth-bishop|title=Elizabeth Bishop – Poet}}</ref>

==Influences==
[[Image:Great Village Elementary School.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Elementary school in [[Great Village, Nova Scotia]], where Bishop first attended school.]]
Bishop was greatly influenced by the poet [[Marianne Moore]],<ref>Kalstone, David. ''Becoming a Poet: Elizabeth Bishop with Marianne Moore and Robert Lowell.'' University of Michigan Press (2001): 4. In an early letter to Moore, Bishop wrote: "[W]hen I began to read your poetry at college I think it immediately opened up my eyes to the possibility of the subject-matter I could use and might never have thought of using if it hadn't been for you.—(I might not have written any poems at all, I suppose.) I think my approach is so much vaguer and less defined and certainly more old-fashioned—sometimes I'm amazed at people's comparing me to you when all I'm doing is some kind of blank verse—can't they ''see'' how different it is?  But they can't apparently."</ref> to whom she was introduced by a librarian at Vassar in 1934. Moore took a keen interest in Bishop's work and, at one point, Moore dissuaded Bishop from attending [[Cornell Medical School]], where the poet had briefly enrolled herself after moving to [[New York City]] following her Vassar graduation. Regarding Moore's influence on Bishop's writing, Bishop's friend and Vassar peer, the writer [[Mary McCarthy (author)|Mary McCarthy]] stated, "Certainly between Bishop and Marianne Moore there are resemblances: the sort of close microscopic inspection of certain parts of experience. [However,] I think there is something a bit too demure about Marianne Moore, and there's nothing demure about Elizabeth Bishop."<ref name="learner.org">Voices and Visions Series. ''Elizabeth Bishop'' Episode. New York Center for Visual History: New York, 1988.[http://www.learner.org/resources/series57.html?pop=yes&pid=590] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180217202739/http://www.learner.org/resources/series57.html?pop=yes&pid=590 |date=February 17, 2018 }}</ref> Moore helped Bishop first publish some of her poems in an anthology called ''Trial Balances'' in which established poets introduced the work of unknown, younger poets.<ref name="learner.org"/>

It was four years before Bishop addressed "Dear Miss Moore" as "Dear Marianne" and only then at the elder poet's invitation. The friendship between the two women, memorialized by an extensive correspondence,<ref>Bishop, Elizabeth. ''One Art; Letters''. New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux (1995) {{ISBN|9780374524456}}</ref> endured until Moore's death in 1972. Bishop's "At the Fishhouses" (1955) contains allusions on several levels to Moore's 1924 poem "A Grave."<ref>Stewart, Susan (2002) ''Poetry and the Fate of the Senses.'' University of Chicago Press 141, 357 fn.78 and fn.79).</ref>

She was introduced to [[Robert Lowell]] by [[Randall Jarrell]] in 1947, and they became great friends, mostly through their written correspondence, until Lowell's death in 1977. After his death, she wrote, "our friendship, [which was] often kept alive through years of separation only by letters, remained constant and affectionate, and I shall always be deeply grateful for it."<ref>Bishop, Elizabeth. ''Poems, Prose, and Letters''. New York: Library of America, 2008. 733.</ref> They also influenced each other's poetry. Lowell cited Bishop's influence on his poem "Skunk Hour" which he said, "[was] modeled on Miss Bishop's 'The Armadillo.'"<ref>Lowell, Robert (2003) ''Collected Poems'' New York: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, p1046.</ref> Also, his poem "The Scream" is "derived from...Bishop's story ''In the Village''."<ref>Lowell, Robert. (2003) ''Collected Poems'' New York: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux p326.</ref> "North Haven," one of the last poems she published during her lifetime, was written in memory of Lowell in 1978.

==Travels==
Bishop had an independent income from early adulthood, as a result of an inheritance from her deceased father, that did not run out until near the end of her life. This income allowed her to travel widely, though cheaply, without worrying about employment, and to live in many cities and countries which are described in her poems.<ref Name="ParisR"/><ref>[http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/7 "Elizabeth Bishop"], ''poets.org'', Retrieved April 25, 2008</ref> She wrote frequently about her love of travel in poems like "Questions of Travel" and "Over 2000 Illustrations and a Complete Concordance." She lived in France for several years in the mid-1930s with a friend from Vassar, [[Louise Crane]], who was a paper-manufacturing heiress.

[[File:Elizabeth Bishop House, Key West, FL.jpg|thumb|Elizabeth Bishop House, Key West, Florida]]
In 1938, the two of them purchased a house at 624 White Street in [[Key West, Florida]]. While living there Bishop made the acquaintance of [[Pauline Pfeiffer]] Hemingway, who had divorced [[Ernest Hemingway]] in 1940.

She later lived in an apartment at 611 Frances Street.

[[File:Second Empire architecture in Georgetown.jpg|thumb|200px|left|1312 & 1314 30th Street NW, (built 1868)]]
From 1949 to 1950, she was the Consultant in Poetry for the [[Library of Congress]], and lived at Bertha Looker's Boardinghouse, 1312 30th Street [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.]], in [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]].<ref>http://www.dcwriters.org/</ref>

Upon receiving a substantial ($2,500) traveling fellowship from [[Bryn Mawr College]] in 1951, Bishop set off to circumnavigate South America by boat. Arriving in [[Santos (São Paulo)|Santos]], [[Brazil]] in November of that year, Bishop expected to stay two weeks but stayed 15 years. She lived in [[Petrópolis]] with architect [[Lota de Macedo Soares|Lota (Maria Carlota) de Macedo Soares]], who was descended from a prominent and notable political family.<ref name="rarecommon">[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B05E1D81F3BF93AA35755C0A9649C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all  "The Love of Her Life,"] June 2002 ''[[The New York Times]]'' review of ''Rare and Commonplace Flowers: The Story of Elizabeth Bishop and Lota de Macedo Soares'' Retrieved April 25, 2008</ref> Although Bishop was not forthcoming about details of her romance with Soares, much of their relationship was documented in Bishop's extensive correspondence with [[Samuel Ashley Brown]].

During her time in Brazil, Bishop became increasingly interested in the literature of the country.<ref>Schwartz and Estess (1983) p. 236</ref> She was influenced by Brazilian poets, including [[João Cabral de Melo Neto]] and [[Carlos Drummond de Andrade]], and translated their work into English. Regarding Andrade, she said, "I didn't know him at all. He's supposed to be very shy. I'm supposed to be very shy. We've met once — on the sidewalk at night. We had just come out of the same restaurant, and he kissed my hand politely when we were introduced."<ref>Schwartz and Estess (1983) p329</ref> After Soares took her own life in 1967, Bishop spent more time in the United States.<ref>[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/elizabeth-bishop Poetry Foundation profile]</ref><ref>Oliveira, Carmen (2002) ''Rare and Commonplace Flowers: The Story of Elizabeth Bishop and Lota de Macedo Soares'' Rutgers University Press, {{ISBN|0-8135-3359-7}}</ref>

==Publication history and awards==
For a major American poet, Bishop published very sparingly. Her first book, ''North & South'', was first published in 1946 and won the Houghton Mifflin Prize for poetry. This book included important poems like "The Man-Moth" (which describes a dark and lonely fictional creature inspired by what Bishop noted was "[a] newspaper misprint for 'mammoth'") and "The Fish" (in which Bishop describes a caught fish in exacting detail). But she didn't publish a follow-up until nine years later. That volume, titled ''[[Poems: North & South—A Cold Spring]]'', first published in 1955, included her first book, plus the 18 new poems that constituted the new "Cold Spring" section. Bishop won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry|Pulitzer Prize]] for this book in 1956.

Then there was another long wait before her next volume, ''Questions of Travel'', in 1965. This book showed the influence that living in Brazil had had on Bishop's writing. It included poems in the book's first section that were explicitly about life in Brazil including "Arrival at Santos," "Manuelzinho," and "The Riverman." But in the second section of the volume Bishop also included pieces set in other locations like "In the Village" and "First Death in Nova Scotia", which take place in her native country. ''Questions of Travel'' was her first book to include one of her short stories (the aforementioned "In the Village").

Bishop's next major publication was ''The Complete Poems'' (1969), which included eight new poems and won a [[National Book Award for Poetry|National Book Award]]. The last new book of poems to appear in her lifetime, ''[[Geography III]]'' (1977), included frequently anthologized poems like "In the Waiting Room" and "One Art." This book led to Bishop being the first American and the first woman to be awarded the [[Neustadt International Prize for Literature]].<ref>[http://www.worldliteraturetoday.org/1976-neustadt-laureate-elizabeth-bishop#.UbL_ResjE7A Neustadt International Prize for Literature listing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303215506/http://www.worldliteraturetoday.org/1976-neustadt-laureate-elizabeth-bishop |date=March 3, 2014 }} Retrieved April 25, 2008</ref>

Bishop's ''The Complete Poems, 1927–1979'' was published posthumously in 1983. Other posthumous publications included ''The Collected Prose'' (1984; a compilation of her essays and short stories) and ''Edgar Allan Poe & the Juke-box: Uncollected Poems, Drafts, and Fragments'' (2006), whose publication aroused some controversy. [[Meghan O'Rourke]] notes in an article from ''Slate'' magazine, "It's no wonder ... that the recent publication of Bishop's hitherto uncollected poems, drafts, and fragments ... encountered fierce resistance, and some debate about the value of making this work available to the public. In an outraged piece for ''The New Republic'', [[Helen Vendler]] labeled the drafts 'maimed and stunted' and rebuked Farrar, Straus and Giroux for choosing to publish the volume."<ref>O'Rourke, Meghan. "[http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_highbrow/2006/06/casual_perfection.single.html Casual Perfection: Why did the publication of Elizabeth Bishop's drafts cause an uproar?]" ''Slate''. June 13, 2006.</ref>

==Literary style and identity==
Where some of her notable contemporaries like [[Robert Lowell]] and [[John Berryman]] made the intimate details of their personal lives an important part of their poetry, Bishop avoided this practice altogether.<ref name="Vendler">[http://media.nybooks.com/110308-vendler.mp3 Helen Vendler phone interview on Robert Lowell and Elizabeth Bishop] audio podcast from ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''. Accessed September 11, 2010</ref> In contrast to this [[confessional poetry|confessional]] style involving large amounts of self-exposure, Bishop's style of writing, though it sometimes involved sparse details from her personal life, was known for its highly detailed, objective, and distant point of view and for its reticence on the kinds of personal subject matter that the work of her contemporaries involved. She used discretion when writing about details and people from her own life. "In the Village," a piece about her childhood and mentally unstable mother, is written as a third-person narrative, and so the reader would only know of the story's autobiographical origins by knowing about Bishop's childhood.<ref>Bishop, Elizabeth. "In the Village." ''Questions of Travel''.</ref>

Bishop did not see herself as a "lesbian poet" or as a "female poet." Because she refused to have her work published in all-female poetry anthologies, other female poets involved with the women's movement thought she was hostile towards the movement. For instance, a student at Harvard who was close to Bishop in the 60s, [[Kathleen Spivack]], wrote in her memoir, "I think Bishop internalized the misogyny of the time. How could she not? ... Bishop had a very ambivalent relation to being a woman plus poet—plus lesbian—in the Boston/Cambridge/Harvard nexus ... Extremely vulnerable, sensitive, she hid much of her private life. She wanted nothing to do with anything that seemed to involve the women's movement. She internalized many of the male attitudes of the day toward women, who were supposed to be attractive, appealing to men, and not ask for equal pay or a job with benefits."<ref>Spivack, Kathleen. ''Robert Lowell and His Circle: Sylvia Plath, Anne Sexton, Elizabeth Bishop, Stanley Kunitz, and Others.'' Boston: Northeastern University Press, 2012.</ref> However, this was not how Bishop necessarily viewed herself. In an interview with ''[[The Paris Review]]'' from 1978, she said that, despite her insistence on being excluded from female poetry anthologies, she still considered herself to be "a strong feminist" but that she only wanted to be judged based on the quality of her writing and not on her gender or sexual orientation.<ref Name="ParisR"/><ref>Kalstone, David and Hemenway, Robert (2003) ''Becoming a Poet: Elizabeth Bishop with Marianne Moore and Robert Lowell.'' Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press</ref>

Although generally supportive of the "[[confessional poetry|confessional]]" style of her friend, Robert Lowell, she drew the line at his highly controversial book ''The Dolphin'' (1973), in which he used and altered private letters from his ex-wife, [[Elizabeth Hardwick (writer)|Elizabeth Hardwick]] (whom he divorced after 23 years of marriage), as material for his poems. In a letter to Lowell, dated March 21, 1972, Bishop strongly urged him against publishing the book: "One can use one's life as material [for poems]—one does anyway—but these letters—aren't you violating a trust? IF you were given permission—IF you hadn't changed them... etc. But ''art just isn't worth that much''."<ref>''Words in Air: the Complete Correspondence between Elizabeth Bishop and Robert Lowell''. Ed. Thomas Travisano and Saskia Hamilton. New York: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 2008.</ref>

==="In the Waiting Room"===
Bishop's "In the Waiting Room," written in 1976, addressed the chase for identity and individuality within a diverse society as a seven-year-old girl living in Worcester, Massachusetts during World War I.

==="First Death in Nova Scotia"===

Bishop's poem "First Death in Nova Scotia," first published in 1965, describes her first encounter with death when her cousin Arturo died. In this poem, her experience of that event is through a child's point of view. The poem highlights that although young and naive the child has some instinctive awareness of the severe impact of death. She combines reality and imagination, a technique also used in her poem "Sestina."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://staff.washington.edu/rmcnamar/383/bishop.html|title=Elizabeth Bishop: Sestina|last=Ruby|date=January 24, 2012|website=Elizabeth Bishop|access-date=March 9, 2018}}</ref>

=== "Sestina" ===
Bishop's poem "Sestina," also published in 1965, depicts a real-life experience. After her father's death when she was a baby and following her mother's nervous breakdown when she was five, Bishop's poem notes her experience after she has gone to live with relatives. The poem is about her living with the knowledge that she would not see her mother again. Bishop writes, "Time to plant tears, says the almanac. / The grandmother sings to the marvelous stove / and the child draws another inscrutable house."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://staff.washington.edu/rmcnamar/383/bishop.html|title=Sestina|last=McNamarra|first=Robert|website=staff.washington.edu|access-date=March 9, 2018}}</ref> The style of her poem, the [[sestina]], is a poetry style created by [[Arnaut Daniel]] in the 12th century, focused on the emphases of ending words in each line, giving the poem a sense of form and pattern. Bishop is widely known for her skill in the sestina format.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://owlcation.com/humanities/Analysis-of-Sestina-by-Elizabeth-Bishop|title=Analysis of Sestina by Elizabeth Bishop|work=Owlcation|access-date=March 9, 2018|language=en}}</ref>
