'''William James Carter Mayne'''<ref name=eccleshare/> (16 March 1928 – 24 March 2010) was an [[English people|English]] writer of [[children's fiction]]. ''The [[Oxford Companion]] to Children's Literature'' calls him one of the outstanding children's authors of the 20th century and [[The Times Literary Supplement]] reportedly called him "the most original good writer for young people in our time".<ref name=bennett/><ref name=watson/> In 2004, he was convicted of sexual abuse of young readers and received a jail sentence.<ref name="Wainwright">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/may/05/books.booksforchildrenandteenagers|title=Children's author jailed for sex attacks|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2010-02-21 | location=London | first=Martin | last=Wainwright | date=5 May 2004}}</ref>

==Life==
Mayne was born in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], the son of a doctor. He attended school until the age of 17 but "the only part of his education he valued" was five years at the [[choir school]] attached to [[Canterbury Cathedral]]; those experiences were the foundation for his Choir School series of four novels.<ref name=eccleshare/> The school was [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|evacuated during the Second World War]] from Kent to [[Cornwall]].<ref name=walker2000>Mayne, William (2000). ''A Year and a Day''. London: Walker Books. Page 4.</ref> 

He lived for most of his life in [[North Yorkshire]].

Mayne was found dead at his home in [[Thornton Rust]], [[North Yorkshire]], on the morning of 24 March 2010.<ref name=eccleshare/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.darlingtonandstocktontimes.co.uk/news/5081618.Shamed_author_found_dead/|title=Shamed author found dead|date=24 March 2010 |work=[[Darlington & Stockton Times]]|publisher=[[Newsquest]]|accessdate=2010-03-24}}</ref>

==Writer==

Mayne's first novel, ''Follow the Footprints'', was published in 1953. He wrote more than a hundred books, including the Choir School quartet, comprising ''A Swarm in May'', ''Choristers' Cake'', ''Cathedral Wednesday'' and ''Words and Music'' (1955–1963); and the Earthfasts trilogy, an unusual evocation of the [[King Arthur]] legend, comprising ''Earthfasts'', ''Cradlefasts'' and ''Candlefasts'' (1966–2000).

For ''[[A Grass Rope]]'' he won the 1957 [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] from the [[CILIP|Library Association]], recognising the year's best children's book by a [[British subject]].<ref name=medal1957/> He was also a commended runner up for the Medal five times – twice in competition with himself – for ''A Swarm in May'' (1955), ''Choristers' Cake'' (1956), ''Member for the Marsh'' (1956), ''Blue Boat'' (1957), and ''Ravensgill'' (1970).<ref name=ccsu/>{{efn |name=HC}}
Finally he won the 1993 ''[[Guardian Children's Fiction Prize]]'' for ''Low Tide'', a once-in-a-lifetime book award established in 1966, judged by a panel of British children's writers.<ref name=relaunch/>

''A Swarm in May'' was [[film adaptation|adapted as a feature film]] by the [[Children's Film Unit]] in 1983<ref>[http://www.timeout.com/london/film/a-swarm-in-may "A Swarm in May"], ''Time Out''. Retrieved 2013-03-30</ref> and a five-part television series of ''[[Earthfasts (TV series)|Earthfasts]]'' was broadcast by the [[BBC]] in 1994.<ref>[http://www.thechestnut.com/earth/earthfasts.htm ''Earthfasts'' at Little Gems] Retrieved 2013-03-30</ref>

After 1957, Mayne wrote mostly under his own name, but he also used the names Dynely James, Charles Molin, and Martin Cobalt.<ref name=eccleshare/><ref>"MAYNE, William (James Carter) 1928– (Martin Cobalt, Dynely James, Charles Molin)" in Scot Peacock, ''Contemporary Authors New Revision Series''  Vol. 100 (Gale, 2001), p. 301</ref>

The contemporary children's author [[Aidan Chambers]] calls Mayne "notoriously little read by children and much read by adults", essentially an observer and watcher.<ref name=chambers/>
''The Guardian'' Children's Book Editor [[Julia Eccleshare]] calls him "one of the most highly regarded writers" and influential although "sometimes thought of as inaccessible for his young readers".<ref name=eccleshare/> He once said, "All I am doing is looking at things now and showing them to myself when young."<ref name=eccleshare/>

==Conviction==
In 2004, Mayne was charged with eleven counts of indecent assaults of "young girl fans" aged between eight and sixteen. At trial one victim gave evidence of events some forty years in the past. According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', the [[prosecutor]] said Mayne had "treated young visitors as adults". He was described in the courtroom as "the greatest living writer of children's books in English". Mayne had pleaded guilty to the charges, but his solicitor said he had done so while under huge stress and would try to clear his name. On conviction, Mayne was imprisoned for two and a half years and was placed on the [[Sex Offenders Act 1997|sex offenders registry]] for life.<ref name="Wainwright"/> 

An obituary in ''The Guardian'' notes that "Mayne's books were largely deliberately removed from shelves from 2004 onwards", as a result of his conviction.<ref name=eccleshare/>

==Notes==
{{notelist |25em |notes=
{{efn |name=HC |1=
Today there are usually eight books on the Carnegie shortlist. 
According to CCSU, some runners up until 2002 were Commended (from 1954) or Highly Commended (from 1966), with the "High" distinction approximately annual in 1979. There were about 160 commendations of both kinds in 49 years including five for 1955, six each for 1956 and 1957 (two years Mayne was competing with himself), and three 1970 – including no high commendations.}}
