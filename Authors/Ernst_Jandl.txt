'''Ernst Jandl''' ({{IPA-de|jandl̩|lang}}; 1 August 1925 – 9 June 2000) was an Austrian writer, poet, and translator. He became known for his [[Experimental literature|experimental]] lyric, mainly [[Sound poetry|sound poems]] (''Sprechgedichte'') in the tradition of [[concrete poetry|concrete]] and [[visual poetry|visual]] poetic forms.

Influenced by [[Dada]] he started to write experimental poetry, first published in the journal ''Neue Wege'' ("New Ways") in 1952.

He was the life partner of [[Friederike Mayröcker]]. In 1973 he co-founded the [[Grazer Autorenversammlung]] in [[Graz]], became its vice president in 1975 and was its president from 1983 to 1987.

His poems are characterized by German language [[word play]], often at the level of single characters or phonemes.  For example, his famous [[univocalic]] poem "[[ottos mops]]" (in English, "otto's [[pug]]") uses only the vowel "o". Of course, poems like this cannot easily be translated into other languages.

Most of his poems are better heard than read.  His lectures were always known as very impressive events, because of the particular way he pronounced his poems. Poems like "schtzngrmm" ''(his version of the word "[[Defensive fighting position|Schützengraben]]" which describes the trenches of the [[World War I]])''  can be understood only if read correctly. It is an experimental poem in which he tells the sounds of war only with combinations of letters, which sound like gunfires or detonating missiles.<ref>[http://www.fen-net.de/christian.scholz/lecture/Jandl1.htm The poem schtzngrmm]</ref>

He translated [[Gertrude Stein]], [[Robert Creeley]]'s ''The Island'', and [[John Cage]]'s  ''Silence''.

Some other of his best-known poems are "[[Lichtung (poem)|lichtung]]" (also known as "lechts & rinks"{{sic}}, in English "light & reft") and "kneiernzuck".

An example of a short poem, written in English:<ref>"three wives", from Ernst Jandl, ''Stanzen'', 1992. {{ISBN|3-630-86784-7}}</ref>
