'''Count Albert Wass de Szentegyed et Czege''' (Hungarian ''gróf szentegyedi és czegei Wass Albert'', January 8,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0913628/|title=Albert Wass}}</ref> 1908 – February 17, 1998) was a Hungarian [[Nobility|nobleman]], forest engineer, [[Hungarian literature|novelist]], poet and member of the [[Wass de Czege]] family.

Wass was born in [[Válaszút]], [[Austria-Hungary]] (now [[Bonţida|Răscruci, Cluj County]], Romania) in 1908. In 1944 he fled from Hungary, and then joined the fleeing forces of the [[Third Reich]] and ended up in  [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], then emigrated to the U.S. After [[World War II]], he was condemned as a [[war criminal]] by the [[Romanian People's Tribunals]], however, United States authorities refused to extradite Wass to Romania claiming the lack of solid evidence.<ref name="wassalbert.eu">[http://www.wassalbert.eu/wasalbert/rola/Wass_Albert_ledontese_.pdf]</ref>

The works of Albert Wass first gained recognition within [[Hungarian literature]] from [[Transylvania]] in the 1940s. In 1944 he moved to Germany and later in 1952 to the United States, and lived there till his 1998 death in [[Astor Park, Florida]]. During the communist regime his books were banned both in Hungary and in Romania. Part of his works were published in Hungary after the change of political system in 1989, however, before this time, his works were unknown to the Hungarian public.

He is popular among the [[Hungarian minority in Romania]]<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.nlvk.hu/ass/3.pdf |title= Archived copy |access-date= 2010-08-25 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091229123107/http://www.nlvk.hu/ass/3.pdf |archive-date= 2009-12-29 |url-status= dead}}</ref> and has a growing popularity in Hungary. In 2005 in a public assessment (''[[Big Read (Hungarian)|Nagy Könyv]]''), he was found to be one of the most popular Hungarian authors: his book "''A funtineli boszorkány''" (''The Witch of Funtinel'') was named the 12th most popular book; two more books were named in the top 50 ranking, including the family saga "''Kard és kasza''" (''Sword and Scythe'').

== Family ==

The Wass family has traced its descent from the age of [[Árpád]], and is one of the oldest noble families in Transylvania.<ref>[http://www.familyhistory.ro/admin/data/file/20070521Wass.pdf Archives of Wass family in Cege] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408223534/http://www.familyhistory.ro/admin/data/file/20070521Wass.pdf |date=2008-04-08 }} Copies from Antal Valentiny, in András W.

His grandfather, Béla Wass, was a parliamentarian and Lord Lieutenant (főispán) of Szolnok-Doboka county.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ogyk.hu/e-konyvt/mpgy/alm/al897_01/377.htm |title=Magyar Országgyűlési Alamanach on the parliamentary sessions of 1897–1901 |access-date=2008-03-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041107222141/http://www.ogyk.hu/e-konyvt/mpgy/alm/al897_01/377.htm |archive-date=2004-11-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> His father was Count Endre Wass (1886–1975), his mother Baroness Ilona Bánffy de Losonc (1883–1960).

==Youth==
Albert Wass was born in ''Válaszút'' (today [[Răscruci, Cluj|Răscruci]]) at the Bánffy mansion of Válaszút, distinct from the nearby [[Bonţida Bánffy Castle|Bánffy castle of Bonchida]]. His parents divorced early, and he was mostly brought up by his grandfather, Béla Wass.<ref>Ernő Raffay – Mihály Takaró – Károly Vekov: Wass Albert igazsága [Truth of Albert Wass], Szabad Tér, 2004, {{ISBN|963-217-477-1}}</ref> He graduated from the [[Reformed Church]] Secondary School in [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]] on Farkas Street and subsequently earned a diploma of [[forestry]] from the Academy of Economics in [[Debrecen]], Hungary. He continued his studies of forestry and [[horticulture]] in [[Hohenheim]], Germany and [[Sorbonne]], [[Paris]], where he received additional diplomas. He returned to [[Transylvania]] in 1932, as his father fell ill. He had to attend obligatory military service in the [[Romanian Army]], and later settled to run the family estate in the [[Transylvanian Plain]].

His first wife was his cousin Baroness Éva Siemers (1914–1991) of [[Hamburg]]. "Due to pressure from my family, I had to marry my cousin in 1935 (...) this was the only way to avoid bankruptcy of the family lands", Wass wrote later.

He had six children (Vid, Csaba, Huba, Miklós, Géza, Endre); Csaba died at age three. [[Huba Wass de Czege]], born in 1941 in Kolozsvár (now Cluj-Napoca, Romania)<ref name="Kovacs"/> had a significant career in the [[U.S. Army]], achieving the rank of [[brigadier general]]. He is known as a principal designer of the "[[AirLand Battle]]" [[military doctrine]]<ref name="Huba Wass">[http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pubs/people.cfm?q=64 "Brigadier General (Ret.) Huba Wass de Czege"]</ref> and took part in the planning of [[Desert Storm]] against Iraq in 1991.

Wass started to write poems, short stories and articles. His first books were published in 1927 and 1929 in Cluj. In 1934, his novel ''Farkasverem'' (''Wolfpit'') was published by the Transylvanian Guild of Arts. In 1935, he was accepted member of the Transylvanian Guild of Arts, and at the same time he was the first young Transylvanian to be awarded the [[Baumgarten Prize]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

After the [[Second Vienna Award]] (30 August 1940), northern Transylvania was reassigned to Hungary, so in 1941, Wass was nominated as primary forest monitor in the Ministry of Agriculture for the area near Dés (now [[Dej]]).

==During World War II==
From May 1942 he took part in military training with the Hungarian [[Cavalry]] as a reserve officer, achieving rank of [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]]. In his memoirs, Wass claims to have become [[chief editor]] of ''[[Ellenzék]]'' in May 1943, as his boss was drafted into the army. He writes:

<blockquote>two soldiers of [[Gestapo]] entered the editorial, showing the order they have to monitor the newspaper. I simply left the building, and walked up the mountains. Two weeks later, my father sent me a message that the Germans are looking for me. To avoid conflict, General Veress, the commander of military troops in North Transylvania has given me a uniform, and as master sergeant he sent me to [[Reichskommissariat Ukraine|Ukraine]] with 9th Hungarian Cavalry, from which I returned only at Christmas.
</blockquote>

Wass became the [[aide-de-camp]] of General [[Lajos Veress]] in 1944. As the war was drawing to an end and the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] (and later Romanian) troops were drawing forward into Transylvania, as an officer, he did not wait for the occupation of North Transylvania, but on Easter 1945, crossed the border and chose [[emigration]].{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

==World War II sentence for war crimes==
In May 1946, both Albert Wass and his father, Endre Wass, were sentenced to death ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' by a Romanian tribunal for ordering the killing of Romanian peasants from [[Sucutard]] and [[Mureșenii de Câmpie]] and their possessions were confiscated,<ref name="Kovacs">

Romanian authorities tried several times to have him extradited to Romania, however in 1979, after several revisions, the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] refused the petition due to lack of evidence. This was confirmed even after the [[Wiesenthal Center]] denounced him, as he was among the people who were accused of killing Jews. After the analysis of the case, the U.S. dropped the charges against him. Wass continued to insist that he had nothing to do with the killings, and claimed he was the victim of a "[[Zionist]]-Romanian" conspiracy.<ref>{{cite news|title=Retired UF Professor May Face Deportation|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&dat=19790830&id=kI5PAAAAIBAJ&sjid=tQUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6824,9055032|access-date=7 February 2014|newspaper=Ocala Star-Banner (Associated Press)|date=30 August 1979}}</ref>

Albert Wass claimed several times that the secret police of Communist Romania, the [[Securitate]], was trying to assassinate him, but he was not able to prove it. In 1986, he shot a film on bullet marks allegedly resulting from an attempt to kill him, but no solid evidence was found to link it to the Securitate. The two perpetrators of that attempt have been captured by American police, but they were released on account of their Romanian diplomatic passport.

In 2008, his son, Andreas Wass, appealed to the Romanian courts to annul the sentence, but the Romanian courts found that no new evidence was presented and as such, the sentence was upheld.<ref>[http://www.monitorulcj.ro/cms/site/m_cj/news/wass_albert_nu_a_fost_reabilitat_35291.html "Wass Albert nu a fost reabilitat"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722113053/http://www.monitorulcj.ro/cms/site/m_cj/news/wass_albert_nu_a_fost_reabilitat_35291.html |date=2011-07-22 }}, March 11, 2008, ''Monitorul de Cluj''</ref>

== Emigration ==
First traveling to [[Sopron]], he then moved onward to Bleichbach and [[Hamburg]], Germany, and lived there till 1951, where the family of his first wife, Éva Siemers, had been living. He found a job as a nightwatchman at a construction site.

In 1951, Wass emigrated to the United States, together with four of his sons (Vid, [[Huba Wass de Czege|Huba]], Miklós, and Géza).<ref name="Kovacs" /> Due to pulmonary disease, his wife was unable to receive approval for emigration from the US administration and was subsequently left behind in Germany with their other son Endre. The couple later divorced.

In 1952, he married Elizabeth McClain (1905–1987) Elizabeth was the daughter of WG McClain and Florence McClain of Bellaire Ohio both respectively Irish and English immigrants. Elizabeth's family consisted of four children to three girls two boys Carolyn Rose Joseph and John we're her siblings she also had children from a previous relationship two girls and a boy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/130703992|title=Florance Elizabeth McClain (1905–1987) – Find A}}</ref>

Wass founded the American Hungarian Guild of Arts, managing its academic work and publishing activities, and editing its newsletter. He launched his own publishing house, the Danubian Press, which published not only books but English language magazines of the American Hungarian Guild of Arts, too. The Transylvanian Quarterly dealing with Transylvania and related issues, then the Hungarian Quarterly undertaking the general problems of the Hungarian nation became the most important anti-Bolshevik forum of Hungarian exiles.

On 20 August 1993 he was awarded the Commander's Cross of the [[Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary|Hungarian Order of Merit]] by president [[Árpád Göncz]] according to the proposal of prime minister [[József Antall]], received the next year from the Hungarian consul of Florida and [[Sándor Csoóri]] at his home.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.3szek.ro/load/cikk/87667/wass_albert_1908_januar_8%E2%80%931998_februar_17|title = Wass Albert (1908.

Wass's application for naturalization in Hungary was first refused by the government between 1994 and 1998, as his death sentence in Hungary{{dubious|Not a word about a HUNGARIAN trial and death sentence so far. What for?|date=May 2020}} had not been revoked, then impeded by a reply that the naturalization certificate of the 90-year-old author would have been valid for only a year from the date of issue.

Wass committed suicide on February 17, 1998, at age 90 in his [[Florida]] residence after a long struggle with a medical condition. His final wish was to have his remains placed in the garden of Kemény villa in [[Brâncoveneşti, Mureş|Brâncoveneşti]], [[Mureș County]], next to the tomb of author [[János Kemény (author)|János Kemény]].

==Citizenship and rehabilitation attempts==
[[File:A Kemény kastély kertje - Marosvécs (19).jpg|thumb|Rehabilitated]]
It was a long debate in the Hungarian press about the fact that Albert Wass has not received Hungarian citizenship, in spite of his several applications, the explanation given being that he had again became a Romanian citizen after the 1946 [[Paris Peace Conference, 1946|Paris Peace Conference]].

In 2007, Hungarian members of parliament [[István Simicskó]] ([[Christian Democratic People's Party (Hungary)|KDNP]], Christian Democrats) and [[Mihály Babák]] ([[Fidesz]], Young Democrats) have asked president [[László Sólyom]] to grant Albert Wass citizenship posthumously, but were replied that this is not possible for several reasons, for example, he had already received citizenship in 1997, so the writer has died as Hungarian, [http://index.hu/politika/belfold/wass4672/], however, the certificate of citizenship (but not the citizenship itself) was valid only for one year and he refused it as being offensive.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080526040935/http://www.euroastra.hu/node/6700 Habár a hegyeit nem, de magyar állapolgárságát megkaphatta:Wass Albert magyar állampolgárságának visszaállítása | EuroAstra Internet Magazin<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In recent years, some representatives of the [[Hungarian minority in Romania]] and his family attempted his rehabilitation. His son's request for a retrial of the case was rejected by the Romanian [[High Court of Cassation and Justice (Romania)|High Court of Cassation and Justice]] in 2007.<ref>{{in lang|ro}} {{cite news|author=George Roncea |title=Ambasada Ungară atacă la baionetă ziarul "Curentul" |url=http://www.curentul.ro/index.php/Actualitate/Ambasada-Ungara-ataca-la-baioneta-ziarul-Curentul.html |publisher=Curentul |location=Bucharest |date=2008-10-30 |access-date=2008-11-04 |language=ro |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223153817/http://www.curentul.ro/index.php/Actualitate/Ambasada-Ungara-ataca-la-baioneta-ziarul-Curentul.html |archive-date=2008-12-23 }}</ref>

His life has never been examined thoroughly in court, so as a consequence it is a predominant view among Romanians that Albert Wass is a criminal, responsible for the murdering of Romanians and Jews and his condemnation by the Tribunal is just. The rehabilitation attempts are seen as immoral particularly by relatives of those he was accused of murdering.<ref>{{in lang|ro}} {{cite news|author=Eduard Pascu |title=Scriitorul Albert Wass ramane condamnat la moarte si prin decizia Inaltei Curti |url=http://www.gardianul.ro/index.php?pag=nw&id=114363&catid=11&p=scriitorul-albert-wass-ramane-condamnat-la-moarte-si-prin-decizia-inaltei-curti.html |publisher=Gardianul |location=Bucharest |date=2008-05-22 |access-date=2009-06-21 |language=ro |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020070916/http://www.gardianul.ro/index.php?pag=nw |archive-date=2008-10-20 }}</ref>

On May 22, 2004, a statue was unveiled in [[Odorheiu Secuiesc]] bearing no name, only the Hungarian inscription "Vándor Székely" (Wandering Szekler). The sculpture was interpreted in the Romanian press as being of Albert Wass. Two  statues of Wass have been moved to the interior of the Hungarian churches in [[Reghin]] and [[Lunca Mureșului]].

Although Romanian law forbids the cult of those condemned for "offence against peace and mankind or promoting [[Fascism|fascist]], [[Racism|racist]] or [[xenophobia|xenophobe]] ideology",<ref>{{in lang|ro}} {{cite news|author=George Roncea |title=Statul maghiar, interpelat pentru susţinerea unui criminal de război |url=http://www.curentul.ro/index.php/Actualitate/Statul-maghiar-interpelat-pentru-sustinerea-unui-criminal-de-razboi.html |publisher=Curentul |location=Bucharest |date=2008-11-01 |access-date=2008-11-04 |language=ro |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223153843/http://www.curentul.ro/index.php/Actualitate/Statul-maghiar-interpelat-pentru-sustinerea-unui-criminal-de-razboi.html |archive-date=2008-12-23 }}</ref><ref>{{in lang|ro}} {{cite web|url=http://www.cdep.ro/proiecte/2005/100/80/3/leg_pl183_05.pdf|title=Law 107/2006|author=Romanian Parliament|author-link=Romanian Parliament|publisher=[[Romanian Parliament]]|access-date=2008-11-04|language=ro}}</ref> some Romanian localities predominantly inhabited by Hungarian ethnics still retain commemorative statues of Albert Wass.

In another trial, a person was charged because he put a statue in his own yard in [[Sovata]]. Finally he was released from the charge and the authorities were obligated to restore the statue to its original place.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://szekelyfold.ma/hirek/felmentettek-a-wass-albert-szobrot-allito-toth-ferencet|title = Felmentették a Wass Albert-szobrot állító Tóth Ferencet}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://erdely.ma/kozeletunk.php?id=202278&cim=felmentettek_a_wass_albert_szobrot_allito_toth_ferencet |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-06-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806192120/http://erdely.ma/kozeletunk.php?id=202278&cim=felmentettek_a_wass_albert_szobrot_allito_toth_ferencet |archive-date=2016-08-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Albert Wass also has commemorative statues in several localities in Hungary, where he is considered by some on the Right to be a hero and a victim of the regime.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

The representatives of the ruling Fidesz party and the radical nationalist [[Jobbik]] party together voted in early 2011 that several public squares be named after him in [[Budapest]].{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

== Novels, publications ==
In his 1939 work ''Farkasverem'' (''Wolfpit''), he described how the [[Treaty of Trianon|Trianon]] generation found their feet again: the unity of the presentation of social reality, the quest for meting out justice in history, together with ancient language, music, rhythm conquered the hearts of many readers in Hungary. In 1939, he was elected member of the Transylvanian Literary Society and the Kisfaludy Society. In 1940, he was awarded the Baumgarten Prize the second time.

In 1942, he received the [[Klebelsberg Award]] and in the same year on a memorable tour in Hungary he represented Transylvanian literature together with three of his peers. He was even elected member of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] as appreciation for his knowledge in forestry.

His writings were patriotic but did not exacerbate the tensions between the Romanian and Hungarian population during the recover of Northern Transylvania as a consequence of the [[Second Vienna Award]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

His fable ''A patkányok honfoglalása – Tanulságos mese fiatal magyaroknak'' ("The Conquest by the Rats – A Fable for Young Hungarians"), which tells how rats take over a house, because they are tolerated by the magnanimous landowner, is considered paradigmatic for [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] story-telling.<ref>Decision by ''Hungarian National Media and Infocommunications Authority (NMHH)'' from June 11th 2011 for fining ''Arlói Jóléti Szolgálat Közalapítvánnyal'' 25'000,- Ft because of transmission of said text  http://mediatanacs.hu/dokumentum/32837/1314625791m082820110622.pdf</ref><ref>''Symbolische Figuren'' ("Symbolic Figures"), essay by [[Krisztián Ungváry]], author of ''A Horthy-rendszer mérlege, Budapest 2013, in "Budapester Zeitung" from January 30th 2012:  […] after the Ghettoization of the Jews in Transylvania [Albert Wass] published an essay with the telling title ''The Conquest by the Rats''.
