'''Georg Philipp Friedrich Freiherr von Hardenberg''' (2 May 1772 – 25 March 1801), better known by his pen name '''Novalis''' ({{IPA-de|noˈvaːlɪs}}), was an 18th-century German aristocrat, poet, author, [[mysticism|mystic]] and philosopher of [[Early German Romanticism]].

Novalis was born into a minor aristocratic family in [[Electoral Saxony]]. He was the second of eleven children; his early household observed a strict [[Pietism|Pietist]] faith. He studied law at the [[University of Jena]], the [[University of Leipzig]],and the [[University of Wittenberg]]. While at Jena he published his first poem and befriended the playwright and poet [[Friedrich Schiller]]. In Leipzig, he met [[Friedrich Schlegel]], becoming lifetime friends. Novalis completed his law degree in 1794 at the age of 22. He then worked as a legal assistant in [[Tennstedt]] immediately after graduating. There, he met [[Sophie von Kühn]]. The following year Novalis and Sophie became secretly engaged. Sophie became severely ill soon after the engagement and died just after her 15th birthday. Sophie's early death had a life-long impact on Novalis and his writing. 

Novalis enrolled at the [[Technische Universität Bergakademie Freiberg|Mining Academy of Freiberg]] in 1797, where he studied a wide number of disciplines including electricity, medicine, chemistry, physics, mathematics, mineralogy, and natural philosophy. He also met many of the formative figures of Early Germanic Romanticism at this time, including [[Goethe]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Friedrich Schelling]], [[Jean Paul]], and [[August Wilhelm Schlegel|August Schlegel]].  After finishing his studies, Novalis served as a director of salt mines in [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]] and later in [[Thuringia]]. During this time, Novalis also wrote his major poetic and literary works, including ''[[Hymns to the Night]]'', which was published in Friedrich Schlegel's ''[[Athenaeum (German magazine)|Athenaeum]]''. In 1800, Novalis began showing signs of illness, which is thought have been either tuberculosisor [[cystic fibrosis]]. He died on 25 March 1801 at the age of 28.

Novalis's early reputation as a romantic poet was primarily based on his literary works, which were published by his friends Friedrich Schlegel and [[Ludwig Tieck]] shortly after his death, in 1802.  These works include the collection of poems, ''Hymns to the Night'' and ''Spiritual Hymns'', and his unfinished novels, ''Heinrich von Ofterdingen'' and ''The Novices at Sais''. Schlegel and Tieck published only a small sample of his philosophical and scientific writings.

The depth of Novalis's knowledge in fields like philosophy and natural science has only come to be more broadly appreciated with the more extensive publication of his notebooks in the twentieth century. These notebooks show that Novalis was not only well read in these disciplines, he also sought to integrate this knowledge with his art.  This goal can be seen in Novalis's use of the [[literary fragment|fragment]], an literary form that he developed in collaboration with Friedrich Schlegel. The fragment allowed him to synthesize poetry, philosophy, and science into a single art form that could be used to address a wide variety of topics. Just as Novalis's literary works have established his reputation as a poet, the notebooks and fragments have established his intellectual role in the formation of Early German Romanticism.

==Biography==
===Birth and early background===
[[File:Schloss Oberwiederstedt.jpg|thumb|left|[[:de:Schloss Oberwiederstedt|Oberwiederstedt castle]]]]
Novalis, who was baptized as Georg Philipp Friedrich [[Freiherr]] (Baron) von [[Hardenberg (surname)#Noble family|Hardenberg]], was born in 1772 at his family estate in the [[Electorate of Saxony]], the Schloss Oberwiederstedt, in the village of [[Wiederstedt]],<ref name=Just1805 />{{rp|{{plainlink|https://archive.org/details/novalishislifet00hopegoog/page/n32 24}} }} which is now located in the present-day town of [[Arnstein, Saxony-Anhalt|Arnstein]]. Hardenberg descended from ancient, [[Lower Saxony|Lower Saxon]] nobility. Novalis' father was Heinrich Ulrich Erasmus Freiherr (Baron) von Hardenberg (1738&ndash;1814), the estate owner and a salt-mine manager. His mother was Auguste Bernhardine (née von [[:de:Böltzig|Böltzig]]) (1749&ndash;1818), who was Heinrich's second wife. Novalis was the second of eleven children.<ref name= Hiebel1954/>{{rp|{{plainlink|https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5149/9781469657554_hiebel.5 5–7}} }} Although Novalis had an aristocratic pedigree, his family was not wealthy.<ref name="Kermode2009" />

Novalis's early education was strongly influenced by [[Pietism]]. His father was a member of the [[Moravian Church#Herrnhuter Brüdergemeine, 18th-century renewal|Herrnhuter Unity of Brethren]] branch of the [[Moravian Church]]<ref name=Pick1910/> and maintained a strict pietist household. Until the age of nine, he was taught by private tutors who were trained in pietist theology; subsequently, he attended a Herrnhut school in [[Neudietendorf]] for three years.<ref name= Hiebel1954/>{{rp|{{plainlink|https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5149/9781469657554_hiebel.5 6–7}} }}

[[File:Hardenberg-Ns-Wappen.png|thumb|upright=0.5|Coat-of-arms of the Hardenberg family]]
When he was twelve, Novalis was put under the charge of his uncle [[:File:Gottlob_Friedrich_Wilhelm_von_Hardenberg.jpg|Gotlob Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von Hardenberg]] (1728-1800), who lived at his rural estate in [[:File:Lucklum-gutspark-ansicht.JPG|Lucklum]].<ref name=Just1805 />{{rp|{{plainlink|https://archive.org/details/novalishislifet00hopegoog/page/n34 26}} }}  Novalis's uncle introduced him to the late [[Rococo]] world, where Novalis was exposed to [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] ideas as well as the contemporary literature of his time, including the works of the French [[Encyclopédistes|Encyclopedists]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]].<ref name= Hiebel1954/>{{rp| {{plainlink|https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5149/9781469657554_hiebel.6 8}} }} At seventeen, Novalis attended the [[Martin Luther]] [[gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in [[Eisleben]], near [[Weissenfels]] where his family had moved in 1785. At the gymnasium, he learned rhetoric and ancient literature.<ref name=Just1805 />{{rp|{{plainlink|https://archive.org/details/novalishislifet00hopegoog/page/n34 26}} }}

===Jena, Leipzig, Wittenberg: Legal Studies===
Between 1790 and 1794, Novalis went to university to study law. He first attended the [[University of Jena]]. While there, he studied [[Immanuel Kant]]'s philosophy under [[Karl Leonhard Reinhold|Karl Reinhold]],<ref name=Redfield2012/> and it was there that he first became acquainted with [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte's]] philosophy.<ref name= Just1805/>{{rp|{{plainlink|https://archive.org/details/novalishislifet00hopegoog/page/n35 27}} }} He also developed a close relationship with playwright and philosopher [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]]. Novalis attended Schiller's lectures on history<ref name="Hiebel1954" />{{rp|{{plainlink|https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5149/9781469657554_hiebel.7 11}} }} and tended to Schiller when he was suffering from a particularly severe flare-up of his chronic [[tuberculosis]].<ref name="Snell2012" /> In 1791, he published his first work, a poem dedicated to Schiller, "Klagen eines Jünglings" ("Lament of a Youth"), in the magazine ''[[Der Teutsche Merkur|Neue Teutsche Merkur]]'', an act that was partly responsible for Novalis's father withdrawing him from Jena and looking into another university where Novalis would attend more carefully to his studies.<ref name=Saul1982 /> In the following year, Novalis's younger brother, Erasmus enrolled at the [[University of Leipzig]], and Novalis went with him to continue his legal studies.  It was at this time that he met the literary critic [[Friedrich Schlegel]], the younger brother of August.<ref name="Hiebel1954" />{{rp|{{plainlink|https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5149/9781469657554_hiebel.8 13}} }} Friedrich became one of Novalis' closest lifetime friends.<ref name= vonHardenberg1802/> A year later, Novalis matriculated to the [[University of Wittenberg]] where he completed his law degree.<ref name= Kneller2003/>

===Tennstedt: Relationship with Sophie von Kühn===
After graduating from [[Wittenberg]],  Novalis moved to [[Bad Tennstedt|Tennstedt]] to work as an [[actuary]] for a district administrator,<ref name= Kneller2003/> Cölestin August Just, who became both his friend and biographer.<ref name=Just1805/>  While working for Just in 1795, Novalis met the 12-year-old [[Sophie von Kühn]], who at that time was considered old enough to receive suitors.<ref name=Donehower2007 />{{rp|{{plainlink|{{Google Books|id=UYpkY-G1f84C|page=17|plainurl=yes}} 17}}  }} He became infatuated with her on their first meeting, and the effect of this infatuation appeared to transform his personality.<ref name= Hiebel1954/>{{rp|{{plainlink|https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5149/9781469657554_hiebel.10 19}} }} In 1795, two days before Sophie turned thirteen they got secretly engaged. Later that year Sophie's parents gave their consent for the two to become engaged:<ref name= Tieck1815 />{{rp|{{plainlink|{{Google books|id=UYpkY-G1f84C|page=128|plainurl=yes}} 128 }} }} Novalis's brother Erasmus supported the couple, but the rest of Novalis's family resisted agreeing to the engagement due to Sophie's unclear aristocratic pedigree.<ref name = Donehower2007/>{{rp|{{plainlink|{{Google Books|id=UYpkY-G1f84C|page=25|plainurl=yes}} 25}} }}

[[File:Sophie von Kühn.jpg|thumb|[[Sophie von Kühn]]]]
Novalis remained intellectually active during his employment at Tennstedt.  It is possible that Novalis met Fichte, as well as the poet [[Friedrich Hölderlin]], in person while visiting Jena in 1795.<ref name=Gjesdal2020 /> Between 1795 and 1796, he created six sets of manuscripts, posthumously collected under the title ''Fichte Studies'', that primarily address Fichte's work but cover a range of philosophical topics.<ref name=Waibel2004/> Novalis continued his philosophical studies in 1797, writing notebooks responding to the works of Kant, [[François Hemsterhuis|Frans Hemsterhuis]], and [[Adam Karl August von Eschenmayer|Adolph Eschenmayer]].<ref name= Mason1967/>

Novalis's ongoing reflections upon Fichte's ideas, particularly those in the ''Wissenschaftslehre'' (''[[Foundations of the Science of Knowledge ]]'') formed part of the foundation for his later philosophical and literary works:<ref name=Newman1989 /> Novalis focused on Fichte's argument that the concept of identity assumes a tension between self (i.e., "I") and object (i.e., "not-I").<ref name=Seyhan1992/> Novalis's critique of Fichte arose from Novalis's literary commitments:<ref name="Laman2004" /> Novalis suggests that the tension between self and object that Fichte asserts is actually a tension between language and imagination.<ref name= Aldouri2019 /> Later, Novalis would take his critique further, suggesting that identity is not the separation of subject and object, but a dynamic process of equal partners in mutual communication. Novalis's viewpoint is summarized in his aphorism "Statt Nicht-Ich -- Du!" ("Instead of 'not-I', you").<ref name=Seyhan1992/>

In the final months of 1795, Sophie began to suffer declining health due to a liver tumor<ref name=Mason1961/> that was thought to be caused by tuberculosis.<ref name = Barroso2019 />  As a result, she underwent liver surgery in Jena, which was performed without anesthesia.<ref name = Donehower2007/>{{rp|{{plainlink|{{Google Books|id=UYpkY-G1f84C|page=24|plainurl=yes}} 24}} }}  In January 1797, Novalis was appointed [[auditor]] to the salt works at Weissenfels.  To earn a stable income for his intended marriage, he accepted the position and moved to Weissenfels to assume his duties. Sophie, on the other hand, stayed with her family.<ref name=Just1805/>{{rp|{{plainlink|https://archive.org/details/novalishislifet00hopegoog/page/n38 31}} }} Sophie once more became extremely ill, during which time Novalis's parents finally relented and agreed to the couple's engagement.  However, two days after her fifteenth birthday, Sophie died, while Novalis was still in Weissenfels.  Four months later, Novalis's brother Erasmus, who had been diagnosed with tuberculosis, also died.<ref name=Barroso2019/> The death of Sophie, as well as his younger brother, affected Novalis deeply. Their deaths catalyzed his more intensive commitment to poetic expression.<ref name = Donehower2007/>{{rp|{{plainlink|{{Google Books|id=UYpkY-G1f84C|page=1|plainurl=yes}} 1–2}} }} Sophie's death also became the central inspiration for one of the few works Novalis published in his lifetime, {{lang|de|Hymnen an die Nacht}} (''Hymns to the Night'').<ref name= Wessell1975/>

===Freiberg: The Mining Academy===
At the end of 1797, Novalis entered the [[Technische Universität Bergakademie Freiberg|Mining Academy of Freiberg]] in [[Saxony]] to become qualified as a member of the staff for the salt works at Weissenfels. His principle mentor at the academy was the geologist, [[Abraham Gottlob Werner|Abraham Werner]].<ref name=Just1805 />{{rp|{{plainlink|https://archive.org/details/novalishislifet00hopegoog/page/n41 49}} }} While at the academy, Novalis immersed himself in a wide range of studies, including electricity, galvanism, alchemy, medicine, chemistry, physics, mathematics, and natural philosophy.<ref name= Johnson1998 />  He was also able to expand his intellectual social circle.  On his way to Freiberg, he met [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Friedrich Schelling]], and they later went on an art tour of [[Dresden]] together. He visited [[Goethe]] and Friedrich Schlegel's older brother, August, in [[Weimar]] and met the writer [[Jean Paul]] in Leipzig.<ref name="Hiebel1954" />{{rp|{{plainlink|https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5149/9781469657554_hiebel.11 27}} }}

[[File:Novalisplaque.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Novalis house plaque, [[Freiberg, Saxony|Freiberg]]]]
In December 1798, Novalis became engaged for the second time. His fiancée was Julie von Charpentier, a daughter of Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Toussaint von Charpentier, the chair of mining studies at the University of Leipzig.<ref name=Just1805/>{{rp|{{plainlink|https://archive.org/details/novalishislifet00hopegoog/page/n48 41}} }} Unlike his relationship with Sophie, Novalis's affection for Julie developed more gradually. He initially saw his affection for Julie as a more "earthly" passion compared to his "heavenly" passion for Sophie, though he gradually softened this distinction with time. Eventually his feelings for Julie became the subject of some of his poetry, including the ''Spiritual Songs'' written in the last years of his life.<ref name="O'Brien1995" />  Novalis and Julie remained engaged until Novalis's death in 1801, and she tended him during his final illness.<ref name=Just1805/>{{rp|{{plainlink|https://archive.org/details/novalishislifet00hopegoog/page/n51 43}} }}

In Freiberg, he remained active with his literary work. It was at this time that he began a collection of notes for a project to unite the separate sciences into a universal whole.<ref name= Wood2007 /> In this collection, ''Das allgemeine Brouillon (Notes for a General Encyclopedia)'', Novalis began integrating his knowledge of natural science into his literary work.  This integration can be seen in an unfinished novel he composed during this time, ''Die Lehrlinge zu Sais'' (''The Novices at Sais''), which incorporated natural history from his studies as well as ideas from his Fichte studies into a meditation on poetry and love as keys to understanding nature.<ref name= Mahoney1992 />  More specifically, he began thinking about how to incorporate his recently acquired knowledge of mining to his philosophical and poetic worldview. In this respect, he shared a commonality with other German authors of the Romantic age by connecting his studies in the mining industry, which was undergoing then the first steps to industrialization, with his literary work.<ref name="Ziolkowski1992" />  This connection between his scientific interest in mining, philosophy and literature came to fruition later when he began composing his second unfinished novel, ''Heinrich von Ofterdingen''.<ref name=Erlin2014 />

[[File:Weissenfels Hardenberg Novalis.jpg|thumb|upright= 0.75|Novalis's grave in Weissenfels]]
Novalis also began to be noticed as a published author at this time. In 1798, Novalis's fragments appeared in the Schlegel brother's magazine, ''Athenaeum''. These works included {{lang|de|Blüthenstaub}} (''Pollen''), {{lang|de|Glauben und Liebe oder der König und die Königin}} (''Faith and Love or the King and the Queen''), and ''Blumen'' (''Flowers'').<ref name=Pick1910 /> The publication of ''Pollen'' saw the first appearance of his [[pen name]], "Novalis".  His choice of pen name was taken from his 12th-century ancestors who named themselves{{lang|la|de Novali}}, after their settlement [[Grossenrode]], which is called {{lang|la|magna Novalis}} in Latin.<ref name="Mahoney2004" /> {{lang|la|Novalis}} can also be interpreted as "one who cultivates new land", which connotes the metaphoric role that Novalis saw for himself.<ref name = Donehower2007/>{{rp|{{plainlink|{{Google Books|id=UYpkY-G1f84C|page=7|plainurl=yes}} 7}} }} This metaphoric sense of his pen name can be seen in the [[epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] of ''Pollen'', the first work he published as Novalis: "Friends, the soil is poor, we must scatter seed abundantly for even a moderate harvest".<ref name=Gelley1991b/>

===Weissenfels: The final years===
In early 1799, Novalis had completed his studies at Leipzig and returned to the management of salt mines in Weissenfels.<ref name= Hiebel1954/>{{rp|{{plainlink|https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5149/9781469657554_hiebel.12 29–30}} }} By December, he became an assessor of the salt mines and a director, and at the end of 1800, the 28-year-old Novalis was appointed an ''[[Amtmann]]'' for the [[Thuringia|district of Thuringia]],<ref name=Just1805/>{{rp|{{plainlink|https://archive.org/details/novalishislifet00hopegoog/page/n50 42}} }} a position comparable to a contemporary [[magistrate]].

While on a trip to Jena in the summer of 1799, Novalis met [[Ludwig Tieck]], who became one of his closest friends and greatest intellectual influences in the last two years of his life.<ref name= Hiebel1954/>{{rp|{{plainlink|https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5149/9781469657554_hiebel.13 30–34}} }} They became part of an informal social circle that formed around the Schlegel brothers, which has been come to be known as the [[Jena Romanticism|Jena Romantics]] or ''Frühromantiker'' ("early romantics").<ref name = Redding2009/> The interests of the Jena Romantics extended to philosophy as well as literature and aesthetics,<ref name="Rush2005" /> and has been considered as a philosophical movement in its own right.<ref name="Beiser2003" /> Under the influence of Tieck, Novalis studied the works of the seventeenth-century mystic, [[Jakob Böhme]], with whom he felt a strong affinity.<ref name="Mayer1993" /> He also became deeply engaged with the [[Platonism|Platonic]] [[aesthetics]] of Hemsterhuis,<ref name=Stoljar1997/> as well as the writings of the theologian and philosopher [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]].<ref name= Hiebel1954/>{{rp|{{plainlink|https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5149/9781469657554_hiebel.13 32}} }} Schleiermacher's work inspired Novalis to write his essay, ''Christenheit oder Europe'' (''Christianity or Europe''),<ref name=Smith2011/> a call to return Europe to a cultural and social unity whose interpretation continues to be a source of controversy.<ref name=Kleingeld2008 />  During this time, he also wrote his poems known as ''Geistliche Lieder'' (''Spiritual Songs'')<ref name=Pick1910 /> and began his novel ''Heinrich von Ofterdingen''.<ref name=Tieck1815 />

From August 1800, Novalis began to cough up blood. At the time, he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. However, recent research suggests that he may have suffered from [[cystic fibrosis]], a genetic disorder that may have been responsible for the early death of many of his siblings, including his brother Erasmus.<ref name = Barroso2019/> After a severe hemorrhage in November, he was temporarily moved to Dresden for medical reasons. In January, he requested to be with his parents in Weissenfels. He died there on 25 March 1801 at the age of twenty-eight.<ref name=Tieck1815 /> He was buried in Weissenfels's ''Alter Friedhof'' (''Old Cemetery'').

==Legacy==

===As romantic poet===
When he died, Novalis had only published  ''Pollen'', ''Faith and Love'',  ''Blumen'', and ''Hymns to the Night''. Most of Novalis's writings, including his novels and philosophical works, were neither completed nor published in his lifetime.  This problem continues to obscure a full appreciation of his work.<ref name=Wood2002/> His unfinished novels ''Heinrich von Ofterdingen'' and ''The Novices at Sais'' and numerous other poems and fragments were published posthumously by Ludwig Tieck and Friedrich Schlegel. However, their publication of Novalis's more philosophical fragments was disorganized and incomplete. A systematic and more comprehensive collection of Novalis's fragments from his notebooks was not available until the twentieth century.<ref name=Mason1961/>

During the nineteenth century, Novalis was primarily seen as a passionate love-struck poet who mourned the death of his beloved and yearned for the hereafter.<ref name=Haase1979/> He was known as the poet of the '' [[blue flower]]'', a symbol of romantic yearning from Novalis's unfinished Novel ''Heinrich von Ofterdingen'' that became an key emblem for German Romanticism.<ref name=Robles2020 /> His fellow Jena Romantics, such as Friedrich Schlegel, Tieck, and Schleiermacher, also describe him as a poet who dreamt of a spiritual world beyond this one.<ref name=Haussmann1912 />  Novalis's diagnosis of tuberculosis, which was known as the ''[[tuberculosis#Society and culture|white plague]]'', contributed to his romantic reputation.<ref name= Robles2020 /> Because Sophie von Kühn was also thought to have died from tuberculosis, Novalis became the poet of the blue flower who was reunited with his beloved through the death of the white plague.<ref name=Barroso2019 />

The image of Novalis as romantic poet became enormously popular. When Novalis's biography by his long-time friend August Cölestin Just was published in 1815, Just was criticized for misrepresenting Novalis's poetic nature because he had written that Novalis was also a hard-working mine inspector and magistrate.<ref name=Donehower2007/>  Even the literary critic [[Thomas Carlyle]], whose essay on Novalis played a major role in introducing him to the English-speaking world and took Novalis's philosophical relationship to Fichte and Kant seriously,<ref name=Harrold1930/> emphasized Novalis as a [[mysticism|mystic poet]] in the style of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]].<ref name=Carlyle1829/>  The author and theologian [[George MacDonald]], who translated Novalis's ''Hymns to the Night'' in 1897 into English,<ref name="MacDonald1897" /> also understood him as a mystic poet.<ref name="Partridge2014"/>

===As philosophical thinker===
In the twentieth century, Novalis's writings were more thoroughly and systematically collected than previously. The availability of these works provide further evidence that his interests went beyond poetry and novels and has led to a reassessment of Novalis's literary and intellectual goals.<ref name=Ziolkowski1996 />  He was  deeply read in science, law, philosophy, politics and [[political economy]] and left an abundance of notes on these topics. His early work displays his ease and familiarity with these diverse fields. His later works also include topics from his professional duties. In his notebooks, Novalis also reflected on the scientific, aesthetic, and philosophical significance of his interests. In his ''Notes for a Romantic Encyclopaedia'', he worked out connections between the different fields he studied as he sought to integrate them into a unified worldview.<ref name="Kneller2008" />

Novalis's philosophical writings are often grounded in nature. His works explore how personal freedom and creativity emerge in the affective understanding of the world and others. He suggests that this can only be accomplished if people are not estranged from the earth.<ref name="Nassar2013" />{{rp|{{plainlink|{{Google Books|Iw9JAgAAQBAJ|page=55|plainurl=yes}} 55}}}} In ''Pollen'', Novalis writes "We are on a mission: Our calling is the cultivation of the earth",<ref name=Gelley1991b/> arguing that human beings come to know themselves through experiencing and enlivening nature.<ref name="Nassar2013" />{{rp|{{plainlink|{{Google Books|Iw9JAgAAQBAJ|page=55|plainurl=yes}} 55}}}} Novalis's personal commitment to understanding one's self and the world through nature can be seen in Novalis's unfinished novel, ''Heinrich von Ofterdingen'', in which he uses his knowledge of natural science derived from his work overseeing salt mining to understand the human condition.<ref name=Erlin2014 /> Novalis's commitment to cultivating nature has even been considered as a potential source of insight for a deeper understanding of the environmental crisis.<ref name=Becker&Manstetten2004/>

==Magical idealism==
[[File:Philipp Otto Runge 001.jpg|thumb|[[Philipp Otto Runge]]'s ''Der kleine Morgen'' (''Little Morning'') (1808) was also inspired by Novalis's ideas.<ref name=GHDI2003 />]]
Novalis's personal worldview—informed by his education, philosophy, professional knowledge, and pietistic background—has become known as ''magical idealism'', a name derived from Novalis's reference in his 1798 notebooks to a type of literary prophet, the ''magischer Idealist'' (''magical idealist'').<ref name="Warnes2006" />  In this worldview, philosophy and poetry are united.<ref name=Wood2007/> Magical idealism is Novalis's synthesis of the  [[German idealism]] of Fichte and Schelling with the creative imagination.<ref name=Cahen-Maurel2019/> The goal of the creative imagination is to break down the barriers between language and world, as well as the subject and object.<ref name="Warnes2006" /> The ''magic'' is the enlivening of nature as it responds to our will.<ref name=Wood2007/>

Another element of Novalis's magical idealism is his concept of ''love''. In Novalis's view, love is a sense of relationship and sympathy between all beings in the world,<ref name=Cahen-Maurel2019/> which is considered both the basis of magic and its goal.<ref name=Wood2007/> From one perspective, Novalis's emphasis on the term ''magic'' represents a challenge to what he perceived as the [[disenchantment]] that came with modern rationalistic thinking.<ref name="Josephson-Storm2017" />{{rp|{{plainlink|{{Google books|id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ|page=88|plainurl=yes}} 88 }} }} From another perspective, however, Novalis's use of ''magic'' and ''love'' in his writing is a [[Performativity|performative act]] that enacts a key aspect of his philosophical and literary goals. These words are meant to startle readers into attentiveness, making them aware of his use of the arts, particularly poetry with its metaphor and symbolism, to explore and unify various understandings of nature in his all-embracing investigations.<ref name= Kneller2010/>

Magical idealism also addresses the idea of health.<ref name=Cahen-Maurel2019/> Novalis derived his theory of health from the Scottish physician [[John Brown (physician, born 1735)|John Brown]]'s [[Brunonian system of medicine]], which sees illness as a mismatch between sensory stimulation and internal state.<ref name=Warnes2009 /> Novalis extends this idea by suggesting that illness arises from a disharmony between the self and the world of nature.<ref name=Cahen-Maurel2019/> This understanding of health is immanent: the "magic" is not otherworldly, it is based on the body and mind's relationship to the environment.<ref name=Neubauer1971/> According to Novalis, health is maintained when we use our bodies as means to sensitively perceive the world rather than to control the world: the ideal is where the individual and the world interplay harmoniously.<ref name=Beiser2003/> It has been argued that there is an anxiety in Novalis's sense of magical idealism that denies actual touch, which leads inevitably  to death, and replaces it with an idea of "distant touch".<ref name="Krell1998" />

==Religious views==

Novalis's religious perspective remains a subject of debate. Novalis's early rearing in a Pietist household affected him through this life.<ref name=Just1805/>{{rp|{{plainlink|https://archive.org/details/novalishislifet00hopegoog/page/n32 25}} }} The impact of his religious background on his writings are particularly clear in his two major poetic works. ''Hymns to the Night'' contains many Christian symbols and themes.<ref name= Hiebel1954/>{{rp|{{plainlink|https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5149/9781469657554_hiebel.20 68–78}}}} And, Novalis's ''Spiritual Songs'', which were posthumously published in 1802 were incorporated into Lutheran hymnals; Novalis called the poems "Christian Songs", and they were intended to be published in the ''Athenaeum'' under the title ''Specimens From a New Devotional Hymn Book''.<ref name= Hiebel1954/>{{rp|{{plainlink|https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5149/9781469657554_hiebel.21 78}} }}  One of his final works, which was posthumously named ''Die Christenheit oder Europa'' (''Christianity or Europe'') when it was first published in full in 1826, has generated a great deal of controversy regarding Novalis's religious views.<ref name=Kleingeld2008/>  This essay, which Novalis himself had simply entitled ''Europa'', called for European unity in Novalis's time by poetically referencing a mythical Medieval golden age when Europe was unified under the Catholic Church.<ref name=Littlejohns2007/>

One view of Novalis's work is that it maintains a traditional Christian outlook. Novalis's brother Karl writes that during his final illness, Novalis would read the works of the theologians [[Nicolaus Zinzendorf]] and [[Johann Kaspar Lavater]], as well as the [[Bible]].<ref name=vonHardenberg1802 /> On the other hand, during the decades following Novalis's death, German intellectuals, such as the author [[Karl Hillebrand]] and the literary critic [[Hermann Theodor Hettner]] thought that Novalis was essentially a Catholic in his thinking.<ref name=Haussmann1912 /> In the twentieth century, this view of Novalis has sometimes led to negative assessments of his work.  ''Hymns to the Night'' has been described as an attempt by Novalis to use religion to avoid the challenges of modernity,<ref name=Monroe1983 /> and ''Christianity or Europe'' has been described variously as desperate prayer, a reactionary manifesto or a theocratic dream.<ref name=Kleingeld2008/>

Another view of Novalis's work is that it reflects a Christian mysticism.<ref name= Hiebel1954/>  After Novalis died, the Jena Romantics wrote of him as a seer who would bring forth a new gospel:<ref name=Haussmann1912 />  one who lived his life as one aiming toward the spiritual while looking at death as a means of overcoming human limitation<ref name=Wernaer1910/> in a revolutionary movement toward God.<ref name=Wessell1975/> In this more romantic view, Novalis was a visionary who saw contemporary Christianity as a stage to an even higher expression of religion<ref name=Willoughby1934/> where earthly love rises to a heavenly love<ref name= Toy1918 /> as death itself is defeated by that love.<ref name=Rehder1948 />  At the end of the nineteenth century, the playwright and poet [[Maurice Maeterlinck]] also described Novalis as a mystic. However, Maeterlinck acknowledged the impact of Novalis's intellectual interests on his religious views, describing Novalis as a "scientific mystic" and comparing him to the physicist and philosopher [[Blaise Pascal]].<ref name=Maeterlinck1912/>

More recently, Novalis's religious outlook has been analysed from the point of view of his philosophical and aesthetic commitments.<ref name= Beiser2002/> In this view, Novalis's religious thought was based on his attempts to reconcile Fichte's idealism, in which the sense of self arises in the distinction of subject and object, with [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s [[Philosophy of Baruch Spinoza|naturalistic philosophy]], in which all being is one substance. Novalis sought a single principle through which the division between ego and nature becomes mere appearance.<ref name= Beiser2002/>  As Novalis's philosophical thinking on religion developed, it became influenced by the Platonism of Hemsterhuis, as well as the [[Neoplatonism]] of [[Plotinus]]. Accordingly, Novalis aimed to synthesize naturalism and theism into a "religion of the visible cosmos".<ref name=Crowe2008 />  Novalis believed that individuals could obtain mystic insight, but religion can remain rational: God could be a Neoplatonic object of intellectual intuition and rational perception, the [[Logos#Neoplatonism|logos]] that structures the universe.<ref name=Beiser2002/> In Novalis's view, this vision of the logos is not merely intellectual, but moral too, as Novalis states "god is virtue itself".<ref name=Nassar2013/>{{rp|{{plainlink|{{Google Books|Iw9JAgAAQBAJ|page=78|plainurl=yes}} 78}}}} This vision includes Novalis's idea of love, in which self and nature united in a mutually supportive existence.<ref name="O'Meara2014"/> This understanding of Novalis's religious project is illustrated by a quote from one of his notes in his ''Fichte-Studien'' (''Fichte Studies''):  "Spinoza ascended as far as nature- Fichte to the 'I', or the person, I ascend to the thesis of God".<ref name=Crowe2008 />

According to this Neoplatonic reading of Novalis, his religious language can be understood using the "magic wand of analogy",<ref name=Dieckmann1955 /> a phrase Novalis used in ''Europe and Christianity'' to clarify how he meant to use history in that essay.<ref name= Novalis1799/>  This use of analogy was partly inspired by Schiller, who argued that analogy allows facts to be connected into a harmonious whole,<ref name= Cahen-Maurel2019 /> and by his relationship with Friedrich Schlegel, who sought to explore the revelations of religion through the union of philosophy and poetry.<ref name= Weltman1936 /> The "magic wand of analogy" allowed Novalis to use metaphor, analogy and symbolism to bring together the arts, science, and philosophy in his search for truth.<ref name=Kneller2010/>  This view of Novalis's writing suggests that his literary language must be read carefully. His metaphors and images- even in works like ''Hymns to the Night''- are not only mystical utterances,<ref name = Freeman2000 /> they also express philosophical arguments.<ref name= Gwee2011/> Read in this perspective, a work like Novalis's ''Christianity or Europe'' is not a call to return to a lost golden age.  Rather, it is an argument in poetic language, phrased in the mode of a myth,<ref name=Littlejohns2007 /> for a [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] vision of a unity<ref name = Kleingeld2008/> that brings together past and future, ideal and real, to engage the listener in an unfinished historical process.<ref name=Smith2011/>

===Poetry===
[[File:Novalis.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Posthumous [[Romanticism|Romantic]] portrait of Novalis from 1845 by [[Friedrich Eduard Eichens]] (based on Franz Gareis's 1799 painting)]]
Novalis is best known as a German Romantic poet.<ref name = Wood2007 /> His two sets of poems, ''[[Hymns to the Night]]'' and ''Spiritual Songs'' are considered his major lyrical achievements.<ref name=Mason1961 /> ''Hymns to the Night'' were begun in 1797 after the death of Sophie von Kühn. About eight months after they were completed, a revised edition of the poems was published in the ''Athenaeum''. The ''Spiritual Songs'', which were written in 1799, were posthumously published in 1802.  Novalis called the poems ''Christian Songs'', and they were intended to be entitled ''Specimens From a New Devotional Hymn Book''. After his death many of the poems were incorporated into Lutheran hymn-books.<ref name= Hiebel1954/>{{rp|{{plainlink|https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5149/9781469657554_hiebel.21 78–87}} }}  Novalis also wrote a number of other occasional poems, which can be found in his collected works.<ref name=Mason1961 /> Translations of poems into English include:

===Unfinished Novels===
Novalis wrote two unfinished novel fragments, ''Heinrich von Ofterdingen'' and ''Die Lehrlinge zu Sais (The Novices at Sais)'', both of which were published posthumously by Tieck and Schlegel in 1802. The novels both aim to describe a universal world harmony with the help of poetry. ''The Novices at Sais'' contains the fairy tale "Hyacinth and Rose Petal". ''[[Heinrich von Ofterdingen]]'' is the work in which Novalis introduced the image of the ''blue flower''. ''Heinrich von Ofterdingen'' was conceived as a response to Goethe's ''[[Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship]]'', a work that Novalis had read with enthusiasm but judged as being highly unpoetical.<ref name=Maeterlinck1912 /> He disliked Goethe making the economical victorious over the poetic in the narrative, so Novalis focused on making ''Heinrich von Ofterdingen'' triumphantly poetic.<ref name= Hahn2004 />  Both of Novalis's novels also reflect human experience through metaphors related to his studies in natural history from Freiburg.<ref name= Mahoney1992/> Translations of Novels into English include:

===Fragments===
Together with Friedrich Schlegel, Novalis developed the fragment as a literary artform in German. For Schlegel, the fragment served as a literary vehicle that mediated apparent oppositions.  Its model was the fragment from classical sculpture, whose part evoked the whole, or whose finitude evoked infinite possibility, via the imagination.<ref name= Tanehisa2009 />  The use of the fragment allowed Novalis to easily address any issue of intellectual life he wanted to address,<ref name=Stoljar1997 /> and it served as a means of expressing Schlegel's ideal of a universal "progressive universal poesy”, that fused "poetry and prose into an art that expressed the totality of both art and nature".<ref name="Schlegel1798" /> This genre particularly suited Novalis as it allowed him to express himself in a way that kept both philosophy and poetry in a continuous relationship.<ref name="Kneller2010" />   His first major use of the fragment as a literary form, ''Pollen'',  was published  in the ''Athenaeum'' in 1798.<ref name=Stoljar1997/> English translations include:
*''Pollen''

===Political writings===
During his lifetime, Novalis wrote two works on political themes, ''Faith and Love or the King and the Queen'' and his speech ''Europa'', which was posthumously named ''Christianity or Europe''.  In addition to their political focus, both works  share a common theme of poetically arguing for the importance of "faith and love" to achieve human and communal unification.<ref name=Kleingeld2008 />  Because these works poetically address political concerns, their meaning continues to be the subject of disagreement. Their interpretations have ranged from being seen as reactionary manifestos celebrating hierarchies to utopian dreams of human solidarity.<ref name=Rosellini2000 />

''Faith and Love or the King and the Queen'' was published in ''Yearbooks of the Prussian Monarchy'' in 1798 just after King [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Wilhelm Frederick III]] and his popular wife [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Louise]] ascended to the throne of Prussia.<ref name=Stoljar1997/>  In this work, Novalis addresses the king and queen, emphasizing their importance as role models for creating an enduring state of interconnectedness both on the individual and collective level.<ref name=MataladeMazza2009 /> Though a substantial portion of the essay was published, Frederick Wilhelm III censored the publication of additional installments as he felt it held the monarchy to impossibly high standards. The work is also notable in that Novalis extensively used the literary fragment to make his points.<ref name=Kleingeld2008 />

''Europa'' was written and originally delivered to a private group of friends in 1799. It was intended for the ''Athenaeum''; after it was presented, Schlegel decided not to publish it. It was not published in full until 1826.<ref name=Kleingeld2008 /> It is a poetical, cultural-historical speech with a focus on a political utopia with regard to the Middle Ages. In this text Novalis tries to develop a new Europe which is based on a new poetical Christendom which shall lead to unity and freedom. He got the inspiration for this text from a book written by Schleiermacher, ''Über die Religion'' (''[[On Religion]]''). The work was a response to the French Revolution and its implications for the French enlightenment, which Novalis saw as catastrophic. It anticipated, then, the growing German and Romantic critiques of the then-current enlightenment ideologies in the search for a new European spirituality and unity.<ref name= Hiebel1954/>{{rp|{{plainlink|https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5149/9781469657554_hiebel.22 87–98}} }} 
Below  are some available English translations, as well as two excerpts that illustrate how ''Europa'' has variously been interpreted.

===Collected works (in German)===
Novalis' works were originally issued in two volumes by his friends Ludwig Tieck and Friedrich Schlegel (2 vols. 1802; a third volume was added in 1846). Editions of Novalis' collected works have since been compiled by C. Meisner and [[Bruno Wille]] (1898), by [[Ernst Heilborn]] (3 vols., 1901), and by J. Minor (4 vols., 1907). ''Heinrich von Ofterdingen'' was published separately by J. Schmidt in 1876.  The most current version of Novalis's collected works is German-language, six-volume edition of Novalis works ''Historische-Kritische Ausgabe - Novalis Schriften'' (HKA) is edited by Richard Samuel, Hans-Joachim Mähl & Gerhard Schulz. It is published by [[Kohlhammer Verlag]], Stuttgart, 1960–2006.

The political philosopher [[Karl Marx]]'s metaphorical argument that religion was the [[opium of the people]] was prefigured by Novalis's statement in ''Pollen'' where he describes "[[Philistinism|philistines]]" with the following analogy, "Their so-called religion works just like an opiate: stimulating, sedating, stilling pain through innervation".<ref name="O'Brien1995" /> {{rp|{{plainlink|{{Google Books|id=p-eh94Z7opAC|page=154|plainurl=yes}} 145}}}}

The musical composer [[Richard Wagner]]'s libretto for the opera ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' contains strong allusions to Novalis' symbolic language,<ref name=Scott1998/> especially the dichotomy between the Night and the Day that animates his ''Hymns to the Night.''<ref name=Hutcheon&Hutcheon1999 />

The literary critic [[Walter Pater]] includes Novalis's quote, ''"Philosophiren ist dephlegmatisiren, vivificiren"'' ("to philosophize is to throw off apathy, to become revived")<ref name="Laman2004" /> in his conclusion to ''Studies in the History of the Renaissance''.

The [[Western esotericism|esotericist]] and philosopher [[Rudolf Steiner]] spoke in various lectures (now published) about Novalis and his influence on [[anthroposophy]].<ref name="Steiner1908" />

The literary critic, philosopher and photographer's [[Franz Roh]] term ''magischer Realismus'' that he coined in his 1925 book ''Nach-Expressionismus, Magischer Realismus: Probleme der neuesten europäischen Malerei'' (''Post-expressionism, Magic Realism: Problems in Recent European Painting'') may have been inspired by Novalis's term ''magischer Realist''.<ref name="Warnes2009" />

The 20th-century philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]] uses a Novalis fragment, "Philosophy is really homesickness, an urge to be at home everywhere" in the opening pages of ''The Fundamental Concepts of Metaphysics.''<ref name="Heidegger1929" />

The author [[Hermann Hesse]]'s writing was influenced by Novalis' poetry,<ref name=Mileck1983/> and  Hesse's last full-length novel ''Glasperlenspiel'' (''[[The Glass Bead Game]]'') contains a passage that appears to restate one of the fragments  in Novalis's ''Pollen''.<ref name=Ziolkowski1961/>

The artist and activist [[Joseph Beuys]]'s aphorism "Everyone is an artist" was inspired by Novalis,<ref name=Adamopoulos2015 /> who wrote  "Every person should be an artist" in ''Faith and Love or the King and the Queen''.

The author [[Jorge Luis Borges]] refers often to Novalis in his work.<ref name=Warnes2006/>

The [[krautrock]] band [[Novalis (band)|Novalis]] took their name from Novalis and used his poems for lyrics on their albums.

Novalis records, which are produced by AVC Audio Visual Communications AG, Switzerland, was named in tribute to Novalis's writings.

The avant-garde filmmaker [[Stan Brakhage]] made the short film [https://www.criterion.com/films/23953-by-brakhage-an-anthology-volume-two ''First Hymn to the Night – Novalis''] in 1994. The film, which visually incorporates the text of Novalis's poem, was issued on Blu-ray and DVD in an anthology of Brakhage's films by [[The Criterion Collection|Criterion Collection]].

The artist and animator Chris Powell created the award-winning animated film [https://chrisvpowell.carbonmade.com/projects/6546251 ''Novalis'']. The title character is a robot named after Novalis.

The composer, guitarist, and electronic music artist [[Erik Wøllo]] titled one of his songs "Novalis".
