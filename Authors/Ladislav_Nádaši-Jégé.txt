Dr '''Ján Ladislav Nádaši-Jégé''' (12 February 1866, in [[Dolný Kubín]] – 2 July 1940, in Dolný Kubín) was a [[Slovaks|Slovak]] writer, literary critic and doctor.

==Life==
He was born into a lawyer's family in Dolný Kubín, and studied in [[Kežmarok]], [[Ružomberok]], [[Gyöngyös]] and [[Levoča]]. After leaving exams in Levoča he started to study medicine in [[Prague]]. He planned to leave for [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] in the [[United States]], however, family problems changed his plans. He settled as a doctor in Dolný Kubín, where, with the exception of 1924–25, when he lived in [[Bratislava]], lived his almost whole life. Jégé died in 1940 due to [[heart attack]].

==Works==
He started writing during his studies in Prague. At that time, he was a member of the Detvan association, which supported his literary activities. Under pseudonym Ján Grob (from initials comes his pseudonym Jégé) he wrote several sketches and one novella. Most of his works, however, come from the 1930s and particularly 1920s, when he wrote his best works.
