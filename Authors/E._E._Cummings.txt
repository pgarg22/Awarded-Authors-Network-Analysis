'''Edward Estlin Cummings''' (October 14, 1894&nbsp;– September 3, 1962), often styled as '''e&nbsp;e&nbsp;cummings''',<ref name="chicago84" /> was an American poet, painter, essayist, author, and playwright. He wrote approximately 2,900 poems, two autobiographical novels, four plays, and several essays. He is often regarded as one of the most important American poets of the 20th century. Cummings is associated with [[Modernist literature|modernist]] [[Free verse|free-form poetry]]. Much of his work has idiosyncratic syntax and uses lower-case spellings for poetic expression.

==Life==

===Early years===
Edward Estlin Cummings was born on October 14, 1894, in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], to Edward Cummings and the former Rebecca Haswell Clarke, a well-known [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] couple in the city. His father was a professor at Harvard University who later became nationally known as the minister of South Congregational Church (Unitarian) in Boston, Massachusetts.<ref>Collins, Leo W. ''This is Our Church''. Boston, Massachusetts: Society of the First Church in Boston, 2005: 104.</ref> His mother, who loved to spend time with her children, played games with Cummings and his sister, Elizabeth. From an early age, Cummings's parents supported his creative gifts.<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/cummings/cummings_life.htm|title=E. E. Cummings' Life|work=english.illinois.edu|access-date=27 April 2016}}</ref> Cummings wrote poems and drew as a child, and he often played outdoors with the many other children who lived in his neighborhood. He grew up in the company of such family friends as the philosophers [[William James]] and [[Josiah Royce]]. Many of Cummings's summers were spent on [[Silver Lake (Madison, New Hampshire)|Silver Lake]] in [[Madison, New Hampshire]], where his father had built two houses along the eastern shore. The family ultimately purchased the nearby [[Joy Farm]] where Cummings had his primary summer residence.<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=wpkDRPueLiMC|title=E.E. Cummings: A Biography|first=Christopher|last=Sawyer-Lauçanno|date=January 1, 2004|publisher=Sourcebooks, Inc.|via=Google Books|isbn=9781570717758}}</ref>

He expressed [[transcendentalism|transcendental]] leanings his entire life. As he matured, Cummings moved to an [[I and Thou|"I, Thou"]] relationship with God. His journals are replete with references to ''"le bon Dieu"'', as well as prayers for inspiration in his poetry and artwork (such as "Bon Dieu! may i some day do something truly great. amen."). Cummings "also prayed for strength to be his essential self ('may I be I is the only prayer—not may I be great or good or beautiful or wise or strong'), and for relief of spirit in times of depression ('almighty God! I thank thee for my soul; & may I never die spiritually into a mere mind through disease of loneliness')".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/unitarians/cummings.html |title=E.

Cummings wanted to be a poet from childhood and wrote poetry daily from age 8 to 22, exploring assorted forms. He graduated from [[Harvard University]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree ''[[magna cum laude]]'' and [[Phi Beta Kappa]] in 1915 and received a [[Master of Arts]] degree from the university in 1916.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.notablebiographies.com/Co-Da/Cummings-E-E.html |title=E.

Upon graduating, he worked for a book dealer.<ref Name="PoetryF">{{cite web |url= http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/e-e-cummings |title=E. E. Cummings |date=November 21, 2016}}</ref>

===War years===
In 1917, with the First World War ongoing in Europe, Cummings enlisted in the [[AFS Intercultural Programs#WWI|Norton-Harjes Ambulance Corps]]. On the boat to France, he met [[William Slater Brown]] and they would become friends. Due to an administrative error, Cummings and Brown did not receive an assignment for five weeks, a period they spent exploring Paris. Cummings fell in love with the city, to which he would return throughout his life.<ref name="utexas">{{cite web |url= http://research.hrc.utexas.edu:8080/hrcxtf/view?docId=ead/00030.xml|title=E. E. Cummings: An Inventory of His Collection at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center|publisher=Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center |access-date=May 9, 2010}}</ref>

During their service in the ambulance corps, the two young writers sent letters home that drew the attention of the military censors. They were known to prefer the company of French soldiers over fellow ambulance drivers. The two openly expressed anti-war views; Cummings spoke of his lack of hatred for the Germans.<ref>Friedman, Norman "Cummings, E[dward] E[stlin]", in Steven Serafin, ''The Continuum Encyclopedia of American Literature'', 2003, Continuum, p. 244.</ref> On September 21, 1917, five months after starting his belated assignment, Cummings and William Slater Brown were arrested by the French military on suspicion of espionage and undesirable activities. They were held for three and a half months in a military detention camp at the ''[[La Ferté-Macé|Dépôt de Triage]]'', in [[La Ferté-Macé]], Orne, Normandy.<ref name="utexas" />

They were imprisoned with other detainees in a large room. Cummings's father failed to obtain his son's release through diplomatic channels, and in December 1917 he wrote a letter to President [[Woodrow Wilson]]. Cummings was released on December 19, 1917, and Brown was released two months later. Cummings used his prison experience as the basis for his novel, ''[[The Enormous Room]]'' (1922), about which [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] said, "Of all the work by young men who have sprung up since 1920 one book survives—''The Enormous Room'' by e e cummings&nbsp;... Those few who cause books to live have not been able to endure the thought of its mortality."<ref>Bloom, p. 1814.</ref><!-- Did F Scott Fitzgerald use upper- or lower-case for Cummings's name?  In a direct quote, it matters. -->

Cummings returned to the United States on New Year's Day 1918. Later in 1918 he was drafted into the army. He served a training deployment<ref>{{Cite web|title=ee Cummings Foundation|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/e-e-cummings|url-status=live}}</ref> in the [[12th Division (United States)|12th Division]] at [[Camp Devens|Camp Devens, Massachusetts]], until November 1918.<ref>Kennedy, p. 186.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://freepages.military.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~worldwarone/WWI/divisions.html#Twelfth|title=Data on U.S. Army Divisions during World War I, WWI, The Great War}}</ref>

===Post-war years===
Cummings returned to Paris in 1921 and lived there for two years before returning to New York. His collection ''Tulips and Chimneys'' was published in 1923 and his inventive use of grammar and syntax is evident. The book was heavily cut by his editor. ''XLI Poems'' was published in 1925. With these collections, Cummings made his reputation as an avant garde poet.<ref Name="PoetryF" />

During the rest of the 1920s and 1930s, Cummings returned to Paris a number of times, and traveled throughout Europe, meeting, among others, artist [[Pablo Picasso]]. In 1931 Cummings traveled to the [[Soviet Union]], recounting his experiences in ''[[Eimi (book)|Eimi]]'', published two years later. During these years Cummings also traveled to Northern Africa and [[Mexico]]. He worked as an essayist and portrait artist for ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine (1924–1927).

In 1926, Cummings's parents were in a car crash; only his mother survived, although she was severely injured. Cummings later described the crash in the following passage from his ''i: six nonlectures'' series given at Harvard (as part of the [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures]]) in 1952 and 1953:

{{quote|1=A locomotive cut the car in half, killing my father instantly. When two brakemen jumped from the halted train, they saw a woman standing – dazed but erect – beside a mangled machine; with blood spouting (as the older said to me) out of her head. One of her hands (the younger added) kept feeling her dress, as if trying to discover why it was wet. These men took my sixty-six-year old mother by the arms and tried to lead her toward a nearby farmhouse; but she threw them off, strode straight to my father's body, and directed a group of scared spectators to cover him. When this had been done (and only then) she let them lead her away.}}

His father's death had a profound effect on Cummings, who entered a new period in his artistic life. He began to focus on more important aspects of life in his poetry. He started this new period by paying homage to his father in the poem "my father moved through dooms of love".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~richie/poetry/html/aupoem114.html |title=My father moved through dooms of love |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20050315070117/http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~richie/poetry/html/aupoem114.html |archive-date=March 15, 2005 |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Gary |last=Lane |date=1976 |title=I Am: A Study of E.

In the 1930s Samuel Aiwaz Jacobs was Cummings's publisher; he had started the Golden Eagle Press after working as a typographer and publisher.

===Final years===
[[File:EECummingsGrave.jpg|thumb|right|Grave of E. E. Cummings]]

In 1952, his alma mater, [[Harvard University]], awarded Cummings an honorary seat as a guest professor. The [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures]] he gave in 1952 and 1955 were later collected as ''i: six nonlectures''.

Cummings spent the last decade of his life traveling, fulfilling speaking engagements, and spending time at his summer home, [[Joy Farm]], in [[Silver Lake, New Hampshire]]. He died of a stroke on September 3, 1962, at the age of 67 at Memorial Hospital in [[North Conway, New Hampshire]].<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1962/09/04/archives/ee-cummings-dies-of-stroke-poet-stood-for-stylistic-liberty-unusual.html|url-access=subscription|title=E.&nbsp;E.

==Personal life==

===Marriages===
[[File:EECummings pd4.jpg|thumb|upright|Sketched self-portrait circa 1920]]
Cummings was married briefly twice, first to Elaine Thayer, then to Anne Minnerly Barton. His longest relationship lasted more than three decades with Marion Morehouse.

In 2020, it was revealed that in 1917, before his first marriage, Cummings had shared several passionate love letters with a Parisian sex worker, Marie Louise Lallemand.<ref name="theguardian.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jul/19/revealed-how-a-parisian-sex-worker-stole-the-heart-of-poet-ee-cummings|title = Revealed: How a Parisian sex worker stole the heart of poet EE Cummings|date = July 19, 2020}}</ref> Despite Cummings's efforts, he was unable to find Lallemand upon his return to Paris after the front.<ref name="theguardian.com" />

Cummings's first marriage, to Elaine Orr, his cousin, began as a love affair in 1918 while she was still married to [[Scofield Thayer]], one of Cummings's friends from Harvard. During this time he wrote a good deal of his erotic poetry.<ref name="Kennedy">''Selected Poems'', Ed. Richard S. Kennedy, Liveright, 1994.</ref> After divorcing Thayer, Orr married Cummings on March 19, 1924. The couple had a daughter together out of wedlock. However, the couple separated after two months of marriage and divorced less than nine months later.

Cummings married his second wife Anne Minnerly Barton on May 1, 1929. They separated three years later in 1932. That same year, Minnerly obtained a [[Mexican divorce]]; it was not officially recognized in the United States until August 1934. Anne died in 1970 aged 72.

In 1934, after his separation from his second wife, Cummings met Marion Morehouse, a fashion model and photographer. Although it is not clear whether the two were ever formally married, Morehouse lived with Cummings until his death in 1962. She died on May 18, 1969,<ref>''Marion Morehouse Cummings, Poet's Widow, Top Model, Dies'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 19, 1969.</ref> while living at 4 [[Patchin Place]], [[Greenwich Village]], New York City, where Cummings had resided since September 1924.<ref>Sawyer-Lauçanno, p. 255.</ref>

===Political views===
According to his testimony in ''[[Eimi (book)|EIMI]]'', Cummings had little interest in politics until his trip to the Soviet Union in 1931.<ref name="Blumenkranz">Carla Blumenkranz, [http://www.poetryfoundation.org/article/180437 "The Enormous Poem: When E.E. Cummings Repunctuated Stalinism"]. Poetry Foundation. ''PoetryFoundation.org''.</ref> He subsequently shifted rightward on many political and social issues.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://college.cengage.com/english/lauter/heath/4e/students/author_pages/modern/cummings_ee.html|title=Heath Anthology of American Literature E.E. cummings – Author Page}}</ref> Despite his radical and [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] public image, he was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and later an ardent supporter of [[Joseph McCarthy]].<ref>Wetzsteon, Ross.

==Work==

===Poetry===
Despite Cummings's familiarity with [[avant-garde]] styles (likely affected by the ''[[Calligrammes]]'' of French poet [[Apollinaire]], according to a contemporary observation<ref>Taupin, Rene, ''The Influence of French Symbolism on Modern American Poetry 1927'' (Trans. William Pratt), AMS Inc, New York 1985  {{ISBN|0404615791}}</ref>), much of his work is quite traditional. Many of his poems are [[sonnet]]s, albeit often with a modern twist. He occasionally used the [[blues#Lyrics|blues]] form and [[acrostics]]. Cummings's poetry often deals with themes of love and nature, as well as the relationship of the individual to the masses and to the world. His poems are also often rife with satire.

While his poetic forms and themes share an affinity with the [[Romanticism|Romantic tradition]], Cummings's work universally shows a particular idiosyncrasy of [[syntax]], or way of arranging individual words into larger phrases and sentences. Many of his most striking poems do not involve any typographical or punctuation innovations at all, but purely syntactic ones.

<!---NB **The typography is Cummings' original setting**--->

As well as being influenced by notable [[Modernist literature|modernists]], including [[Gertrude Stein]] and [[Ezra Pound]], Cummings in his early work drew upon the [[Imagism|imagist]] experiments of [[Amy Lowell]]. Later, his visits to Paris exposed him to [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]], which he reflected in his work. He began to rely on symbolism and allegory, where he once had used simile and metaphor. In his later work, he rarely used comparisons that required objects that were not previously mentioned in the poem, choosing to use a symbol instead. Due to this, his later poetry is "frequently more lucid, more moving, and more profound than his earlier".<ref>Friedman, Norman. ''E. E. Cummings the Art of His Poetry''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins, 1967. p. 89.</ref> Cummings also liked to incorporate imagery of nature and death into much of his poetry.

While some of his poetry is [[free verse]] (with no concern for [[rhyme]] or [[meter (poetry)|meter]]), many have a recognizable sonnet structure of 14 lines, with an intricate rhyme scheme. A number of his poems feature a typographically exuberant style, with words, parts of words, or punctuation symbols scattered across the page, often making little sense until read aloud, at which point the meaning and emotion become clear. Cummings, who was also a painter, understood the importance of presentation, and used typography to "paint a picture" with some of his poems.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Iain |last=Landles |author-link=Iain Landles |date=2001 |title=An Analysis of Two Poems by E. E. Cummings |journal=SPRING, the Journal of the e. E. Cummings Society |volume=10 |pages=31–43}}</ref>

The seeds of Cummings's unconventional style appear well established even in his earliest work. At age six, he wrote to his father:<ref>''Selected letters of E. E. Cummings'', (1972) Edward Estlin Cummings, Frederick Wilcox Dupee, George Stade. University of Michigan p. 3 {{ISBN|978-0-233-95637-4}}</ref>

HE IS GOOD NOW, IT IS NOT GOOD TO SEE IT RAIN,<br />
FATHER DEAR IS, IT, DEAR, NO FATHER DEAR,<br />
LOVE, YOU DEAR,<br />
ESTLIN.</small>}}

Following his autobiographical novel, ''[[The Enormous Room]]'', Cummings's first published work was a collection of poems titled ''[[Tulips and Chimneys]]'' (1923). This work was the public's first encounter with his characteristically eccentric use of grammar and punctuation.

Some of Cummings's most famous poems do not involve much, if any, idiosyncratic typography or punctuation, but they still carry his unmistakable style, particularly in unusual and impressionistic word order.

{{Quote box |width=300px |align=right ||salign=right

 |source =From "[[anyone lived in a pretty how town]]" (1940)<ref>[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poem/11856 "anyone lived in a pretty how town" at the Poetry Foundation]</ref>}}

Cummings's works often do not follow the conventional rules that generate typical English sentences (for example, "they sowed their isn't"). In addition, a number of Cummings's poems feature, in part or in whole, intentional misspellings, and several incorporate phonetic spellings intended to represent particular dialects. Cummings also made use of inventive formations of compound words, as in his poem "in Just", which features words such as "mud-luscious", "puddle-wonderful", and "eddieandbill". This poem is part of a sequence of poems titled ''Chansons Innocentes'';<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15398 |title=''Chansons Innocentes'' |access-date=October 10, 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20051227115128/http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15398 |archive-date=December 27, 2005 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> it has many references comparing the "balloonman" to [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], the mythical creature that is half-goat and half-man. Literary critic [[R.P. Blackmur]] has commented that this use of language is "frequently unintelligible because [Cummings] disregards the historical accumulation of meaning in words in favour of merely private and personal associations".<ref>Friedman, Norman. ''E. E. Cummings the Art of His Poetry''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1967. pp. 61–62.</ref>

Fellow poet [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]], in her equivocal letter recommending Cummings for the [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] he was awarded in 1934, expressed her frustration at his opaque symbolism. "[I]f he prints and offers for sale poetry which he is quite content should be, after hours of sweating concentration, inexplicable from any point of view to a person as intelligent as myself, then he does so with a motive which is frivolous from the point of view of art, and should not be helped or encouraged by any serious person or group of persons... there is fine writing and powerful writing (as well as some of the most pompous nonsense I ever let slip to the floor with a wide yawn)... What I propose, then, is this: that you give Mr. Cummings enough rope. He may hang himself; or he may lasso a unicorn."<ref>Millay to Mr. Moe of the Guggenheim Foundation, March 1934. Quoted in Milford, Nancy (2001) ''Savage Beauty: The Life of Edna St. Vincent Millay'', Doubleday: New York, NY. p370.</ref>

Many of Cummings's poems are satirical and address social issues<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15404 |title=why must itself up every of a park |access-date=October 10, 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100813233241/http://poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15404 |archive-date=August 13, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> but have an equal or even stronger bias toward romanticism: time and again his poems celebrate love, sex, and the season of rebirth.<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15403 |title=anyone lived in a pretty how town |access-date=October 10, 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100726121247/http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15403 |archive-date=July 26, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Cummings also wrote children's books and novels. A notable example of his versatility is an introduction he wrote for a collection of the comic strip ''[[Krazy Kat]]''.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/43915279?seq=1] Olsen, Taimi. "Krazies...of indescribable beauty: George Herriman's ''Krazy Kat'' and E. E. Cummings”. ''Spring''. No. 14/15. October 2005. Published by: E.E. Cummings Society. Pp. 220-221.</ref>

===Controversy===
Cummings is known for controversial subject matter, as he wrote numerous erotic poems. He also sometimes included ethnic slurs in his writing. For instance, in his 1950 collection ''Xaipe: Seventy-One Poems'', Cummings published two poems containing words that caused outrage in some quarters.<ref>Friedman, Norman, and Harry Thornton Moore. ''E. E. Cummings the Growth of a Writer''. Carbondale: Southern Illinois UP, 1964. pp. 153–54.</ref>

Cummings biographer Catherine Reef notes of the controversy:<ref Name="Reef" />
{{quote|1=Friends begged Cummings to reconsider publishing these poems, and the book's editor pleaded with him to withdraw them, but he insisted that they stay. All the fuss perplexed him. The poems were commenting on prejudice, he pointed out, and not condoning it. He intended to show how derogatory words cause people to see others in terms of stereotypes rather than as individuals. "America (which turns Hungarian into 'hunky' & Irishman into 'mick' and Norwegian into 'square-head') is to blame for 'kike,'" he said.}}

[[William Carlos Williams]] spoke out in his defense.<ref Name="Reef">''E. E. Cummings'' (2006) by Catherine Reef, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, p. 115 {{ISBN|978-0-618-56849-9}}</ref>{{Clarify|reason=|date=April 2018}}

===Plays===
During his lifetime, Cummings published four plays. ''[[Him (Cummings play)|HIM]]'', a three-act play, was first produced in 1928 by the [[Provincetown Players]] in New York City. The production was directed by James Light. The play's main characters are "Him", a playwright, portrayed by [[William Johnstone (actor)|William Johnstone]], and "Me", his girlfriend, portrayed by [[Erin O'Brien-Moore]].

Cummings said of the unorthodox play:<ref>Kennedy, p. 295.</ref>

''Anthropos, or the Future of Art'' is a short, one-act play that Cummings contributed to the anthology ''Whither, Whither or After Sex, What? A Symposium to End Symposium''. The play consists of dialogue between Man, the main character, and three "infrahumans", or inferior beings. The word ''[[Greek language|anthropos]]'' is the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for "man", in the sense of "mankind".

''Tom, A Ballet'' is a ballet based on ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''. The ballet is detailed in a "synopsis" as well as descriptions of four "episodes", which were published by Cummings in 1935. It has never been performed.<ref>[http://www.gvsu.edu/english/cummings/Tom.html GVSU.edu The E. E. Cummings Society] {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20050423191607/http://www.gvsu.edu/english/cummings/Tom.html |date=April 23, 2005}}.</ref>

''[[Santa Claus: A Morality]]'' was probably Cummings's most successful play. It is an allegorical Christmas fantasy presented in one act of five scenes. The play was inspired by his daughter Nancy, with whom he was reunited in 1946. It was first published in the Harvard College magazine, ''Wake''. The play's main characters are Santa Claus, his family (Woman and Child), Death, and Mob. At the outset of the play, Santa Claus's family has disintegrated due to their lust for knowledge (Science). After a series of events, however, Santa Claus's faith in love and his rejection of the materialism and disappointment he associates with Science are reaffirmed, and he is reunited with Woman and Child.

===Name and capitalization===
Cummings's publishers and others have often echoed the unconventional [[orthography]] in his poetry by writing his name in lower case and without periods ([[full stop]]s).<ref name="friedman92" /> Cummings himself used both the lowercase and capitalized versions, though he most often signed his name with capitals.<ref name="friedman92">{{cite journal |last=Friedman |first= Norman |date=1992 |title=Not "e. e. cummings" |journal=Spring |volume=1 |pages=114–21 |url= http://faculty.gvsu.edu/websterm/cummings/caps.htm |access-date=December 13, 2005}}</ref>

The use of lower case for his initials was popularized in part by the title of some books, particularly in the 1960s, printing his name in lower case on the cover and spine. In the preface to ''E. E. Cummings: The Growth of a Writer'' by Norman Friedman, critic Harry T. Moore notes Cummings "had his name put legally into lower case, and in his later books the titles and his name were always in lower case".<ref>{{cite book |last=Friedman |first=Norman |title=E. E. Cummings: The Growth of a Writer |location=Carbondale |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press |date=1964 |isbn=0-8093-0978-5}}</ref> According to Cummings's widow, however, this is incorrect.<ref name="friedman92" /> She wrote to Friedman: "You should not have allowed H. Moore to make such a stupid & childish statement about Cummings & his signature." On February 27, 1951, Cummings wrote to his French translator D. Jon Grossman that he preferred the use of upper case for the particular edition they were working on.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Friedman |first=Norman |date=1995 |title=Not "e. e. cummings" Revisited |journal=Spring |volume=5 |pages=41–43 |url= http://faculty.gvsu.edu/websterm/cummings/caps2.html |access-date=May 12, 2007}}</ref> One Cummings scholar believes that on the rare occasions that Cummings signed his name in all lower case, he may have intended it as a gesture of humility, not as an indication that it was the preferred orthography for others to use.<ref name="friedman92" /> Additionally, the ''Chicago Manual of Style'', which prescribes favoring non-standard capitalization of names in accordance with the bearer's strongly stated preference, notes "E. E. Cummings can be safely capitalized; it was one of his publishers, not he himself, who lowercased his name."<ref name="chicago84">{{cite book |publisher=Chicago University Press|date=2010|title=Chicago Manual of Style|edition=16|section=Capitalization of Personal Names|page=388}}</ref>

==Adaptations==
In 1943, modern dancer and choreographer [[Jean Erdman]] presented "The Transformations of Medusa, Forever and Sunsmell" with a commissioned score by [[John Cage]] and a spoken text from the title poem by E. E. Cummings, sponsored by the [[Arts Club of Chicago]]. Erdman also choreographed "Twenty Poems" (1960), a cycle of E. E. Cummings's poems for eight dancers and one actor, with a commissioned score by [[Teiji Ito]]. It was performed in the round at the [[Circle in the Square Theatre]] in Greenwich Village.

Numerous composers have set Cummings's poems to music:
* In 1961, [[Pierre Boulez]] composed "Cummings ist der dichter" from poems by E. E. Cummings.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://brahms.ircam.fr/works/work/6957/|title=cummings ist der dichter, Pierre Boulez}}</ref>
* [[Aribert Reimann]] set Cummings to music in "Impression IV" (1961) for soprano and piano.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2743128|title=Impression IV : nach einem Gedicht von E.E.

* [[Morton Feldman]] (1926–1987) in 1951 composed "4 Songs to e.e. cummings" for soprano, piano and cello, using material from Cummings's "50 poems" of 1940: "!Blac", "Air", "(Sitting In A Tree-)" and "(Moan)".
* The Icelandic singer [[Björk]] used lines from Cummings's poem "I Will Wade Out" for the lyrics of "Sun in My Mouth" on her 2001 album ''[[Vespertine]]''. On her next album, ''[[Medúlla]]'' (2004), Björk used his poem "It May Not Always Be So" as the lyrics for the song "Sonnets/Unrealities XI".
* The American composer [[Eric Whitacre]] wrote a [[Eric Whitacre#SATB choral|cycle of works]] for choir titled ''The City and the Sea'', which consists of five poems by Cummings set to music. He also wrote music for “little tree” and “i carry your heart,” among others.
* Others who have composed settings for his poems include [[Dominic Argento]], [[William Bergsma]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Marc Blitzstein]], [[John Cage]], [[Romeo Cascarino]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Serge de Gastyne]], [[David Diamond (composer)|David Diamond]], [[John Woods Duke|John Duke]], [[Margaret Garwood]], [[Daron Hagen]], [[Michael Hedges]], [[Timothy Hoekman]], [[Richard Hundley]], [[Barbara Kolb]], [[Leonard Lehrman]], [[Robert Manno]], [[Salvatore Martirano]], [[William Mayer (composer)|William Mayer]], [[John Musto]], [[Paul Nordoff]], [[Tobias Picker]], [[Vincent Persichetti]], [[Ned Rorem]], [[Peter Schickele]], [[Elie Siegmeister]], [[Aki Takase]], [[Hugo Weisgall]], [[Dan Welcher]], and [[James Yannatos]], among many others.<ref name="lieder">{{citation |title=Author: E.
