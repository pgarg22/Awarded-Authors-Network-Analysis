==Biography==
Born in Paris, Simon attended primary school at [[Pétange]] in the south of Luxembourg. After matriculating from the ''Lycée de jeunes filles'' in [[Luxembourg City]] in 1940, she began to study medicine in [[Bonn]] but in 1942 was forced to work for the [[Reichsarbeitsdienst]] in [[Buckow]]. In 1943, she continued her studies in [[Tübingen]] before spending further periods of study in both Berlin and Paris. After graduating in tropical medicine in Paris, she spent a short period in the United States before taking up employment at the Dudelange Hospital in Luxembourg. Until 1995, she practised as a general practitioner in Pétange.<ref name=dal/>
