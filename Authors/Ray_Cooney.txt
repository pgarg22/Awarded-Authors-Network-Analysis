==Career==
Cooney began to act in 1946, appearing in many of the [[Whitehall farce]]s of [[Brian Rix]] throughout the 1950s and 1960s. It was during this time that he co-wrote his first play, ''One For The Pot''. With Tony Hilton, he co-wrote the screenplay for the British comedy film ''[[What a Carve Up! (film)|What a Carve Up!]]'' (1961), which features [[Sid James]] and [[Kenneth Connor]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmovie.com/movie/what-a-carve-up-v54049/cast-crew|title=What a Carve Up (1961) - Pat Jackson &#124; Cast and Crew &#124; AllMovie|via=www.allmovie.com}}</ref>

In 1968 and 1969, Cooney adapted [[Richard Gordon (English author)|Richard Gordon]]'s ''Doctor'' novels for BBC radio, as series starring [[Richard Briers]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2017/19/bbc.com/mediacentre/proginfo/2017/19/doctor-at-large/|title=Doctor At Large|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> He also took parts in them.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2018/33/bbc.com/mediacentre/proginfo/2018/33/doctor-in-the-house/|title=Doctor In The House|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

Cooney has also appeared on TV and in several films, including a film adaptation of his successful theatrical farce ''[[Not Now, Darling (film)|Not Now, Darling]]'' (1973), which he co-wrote with [[John Chapman (screenwriter)|John Chapman]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b74e3e2e2|title=Not Now Darling (1972)|website=BFI}}</ref>

In 1983, Cooney created the Theatre of Comedy Company and became its [[artistic director]]. During his tenure the company produced over twenty plays such as ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'' (starring [[Peter O'Toole]] and [[John Thaw]]), ''[[Loot (play)|Loot]]'' and ''[[Run for Your Wife (play)|Run For Your Wife]]''. He co-wrote a farce with his son [[Michael Cooney (screenwriter)|Michael]], ''Tom, Dick and Harry'' (1993). Cooney produced and directed the film ''[[Run For Your Wife (2012 film)|Run For Your Wife]]'' (2012), based on his own play.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.runforyourwife.co.uk/Run_For_Your_Wife/Run_For_Your_Wife.html |title=Run For Your Wife |publisher=Run For Your Wife |access-date=2011-12-31}}</ref>  The film however was not a success: it was savaged by critics and has been referred to as [[List of films considered the worst#2010s|one of the worst films of all time]].

Cooney's farces combine a traditional British bawdiness with structural complication, as characters leap to assumptions, are forced to pretend to be things that they are not, and often talk at cross-purposes. He is greatly admired in [[France]] where he is known as "Le Feydeau Anglais", ("The English Feydeau"), in reference to the French farceur [[Georges Feydeau]]. Many of his plays have been first produced, or revived, at the [[Théâtre de la Michodière]] in Paris.

In January 1975, Cooney was the subject of ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' when he was surprised by [[Eamonn Andrews]] at London's [[Savoy Hotel]]. In 2005, Cooney was made an Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]] in recognition of his services to drama.<ref>{{cite news |title=Dramatist Cooney becomes an OBE |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/essex/4135823.stm |work=BBC News |date=31 December 2004 |access-date=2009-02-03}}</ref>
