==Biography==
He was born in [[Geneva]]<ref>His father was Austin Stickney, A.B. Harvard 1852, professor of Latin at Trinity College, Hartford, and Harriet Champion Trumbull Stickney, of a Connecticut family descended from Gov. [[Jonathan Trumbull]] (obituary,''Harvard Graduates Magazine'', '''13''', 1904:242-44)</ref> and spent much of his early life in [[Europe]]. He attended [[Harvard University]] from 1891, when he became editor of the ''Harvard Monthly'' and a member of [[Signet Society]], to 1895, when he graduated magna cum laude.

He wrote there two dissertations, a Latin one on the Venetian humanist [[Ermolao Barbaro]], and the other on ''Les Sentences dans la Poésie Grecque d'Homère à Euripide''. The latter is openly indebted to ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'' and to Stickney's study of the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' under the tutelage of [[Sylvain Lévi]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/lessentencesdan00sticgoog/lessentencesdan00sticgoog_djvu.txt|title=Les sentences dans la poésie grecque d'Homère à Euripide|year=1903|publisher=Société nouvelle de librairie et d'édition}}</ref> Stickney's was the first American [[docteur ès lettres]].
