'''Francis Quarles''' (about 8 May 1592 – 8 September 1644) was an English poet most notable for his [[emblem book]] aptly entitled ''Emblems''.

==Early life==
Francis Quarles was born in [[Romford]], [[Essex]], and baptised there on 8 May 1592. His family had a long history of royal service. His great-grandfather, George Quarles, was Auditor to [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]], and his father, James Quarles, held places under [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] and [[James I of England|James I]], for which he was rewarded with an estate called Stewards in Romford.  His mother, Joan Dalton, was the daughter and heiress of Eldred Dalton of Mores Place, Hadham.  There were eight{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} children in the family; the eldest, [[Robert Quarles|Sir Robert Quarles]], was knighted by James I in 1608.

Francis Quarles was entered at [[Christ's College, Cambridge]], in 1608, and subsequently joined [[Lincoln's Inn]] to read for the bar.<ref>{{acad|id=QRLS608F|name=Quarles, Francis}}</ref> In 1613, when [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Princess Elizabeth]] married [[Frederick V of the Palatinate|Frederick V]] of the [[Electoral Palatinate]], Quarles was made her cupbearer and went with her to the continent, remaining in post for some years.

 |quote =<poem>
I love the earth - she is my Maker's creature,
She is my mother for she gave me birth.
She is my tender nurse - she gives me food.
But what is a creature, Lord, compared with Thee?
Or what is my mother or my nurse to me?

I love the air - her dainty sweets refresh 
My drooping soul and to new sweets invite me.
But what is the air or all the sweets that she
Can bless my soul withal, compared to Thee?

==Career==
Some time before 1629, Quarles was appointed as secretary to [[James Ussher]], [[Archbishop of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Archbishop of Armagh]] and primate of all Ireland.

About 1633, Quarles returned to England, and spent the next two years in the preparation of his ''Emblems''. In 1639 he was made city chronologer, a post in which [[Ben Jonson]] and [[Thomas Middleton]] had preceded him. At the outbreak of the [[English Civil War|Civil War]], he took the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] side, drawing up three pamphlets in 1644 in support of the king's cause. It is said that his house was searched and his papers destroyed by the Parliamentarians in consequence of these publications.

Quarles married Ursula Woodgate in 1618, by whom he had eighteen children. His son, [[John Quarles]] (1624–1665), was exiled to [[Flanders]] for his Royalist sympathies and was the author of ''Fons Lachrymarum'' (1648) and other poems.<ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Quarles, John|last=Thorn-Drury|first=George|authorlink=George Thorn-Drury|volume=47}}</ref>

The work by which Quarles is best known, the ''Emblems'', was originally published in 1634, with grotesque illustrations engraved by [[William Marshall (illustrator)|William Marshall]] and others. The forty-five prints in the last three books are borrowed from the designs by [[Boetius à Bolswert]] for the ''Pia Desideria'' (Antwerp, 1624) of [[Herman Hugo]]. Each "emblem" consists of a paraphrase from a passage of Scripture, expressed in ornate and metaphorical language, followed by passages from the [[Fathers of the Church|Christian]] Fathers, and concluding with an epigram of four lines.

The ''Emblems'' was immensely popular with readers, but the critics of the 17th and 18th centuries had no mercy on Quarles. [[John Suckling (poet)|Sir John Suckling]] in his ''Sessions of the Poets'' disrespectfully alluded to him as he "that makes God speak so big in's poetry." [[Alexander Pope|Pope]] in the ''Dunciad'' spoke of the Emblems, "Where the pictures for the page atone And Quarles is saved by beauties not his own."
