==Background==

Stewart was born in [[London]] in 1955. His family lived first in [[Muswell Hill]], North London and later in [[Morden]], South London, where he went to school.<ref name=FBR>{{Cite web|title=Paul Stewart and Chris Riddell Biography|url=http://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Paul-Stewart-and-Chris-Riddell/biography.html|publisher=Fantasy Book Review|access-date = 13 February 2010}}</ref> His favourite subject at school was English and he hated Mathematics.<ref name=Q&A>{{Cite web|title=Q&A|url=http://www.stewartandriddell.co.uk/q_and_a.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205050321/http://www.stewartandriddell.co.uk/about.php|archive-date=5 December 2013<!--2015-03-17-->|access-date=13 February 2010}}</ref> When Stewart left school, he went travelling, spending several months in Greece, where he took various jobs, including picking oranges and grapes, and whitewashing hotels.<ref name=Achuka >{{Cite web|title=Paul Stewart|publisher=Achuka|url=http://www.achuka.co.uk/archive/interviews/psint.php|access-date=10 February 2010}}</ref>

From 1974 to 1977, Stewart studied at the [[University of Lancaster]], majoring in English, (which included a Creative Writing unit) with a minor in Religious Education.<ref name= Writing>{{Citation| title = Paul Stewart| journal = Writing| issue = December 1998-January 1999 |page=59| date = December 1998}}</ref> On graduation, he went travelling again, before enrolling in 1978 to do an M.A. in [[Creative Writing]] with [[Angela Carter]] and [[Malcolm Bradbury]] at the [[University of East Anglia]].<ref name=Achuka/><ref name=Writing/> He went to Heidelberg, Germany in 1979 for three years, both as a teacher of English and as a student at [[Heidelberg University]], learning German. In 1982, he went to [[Sri Lanka]] 
to teach [[English as a foreign language]] returning to the UK a year later where he continued to teach (1983–90) before becoming a full-time writer.<ref name=Q&A/><ref name= JRank>{{Cite web|title=Paul Stewart (1955–) Biography – Personal, Addresses, Career, Honors Awards, Writings, Adaptations, Sidelights|url=http://biography.jrank.org/pages/1827/Stewart-Paul-1955.html|publisher= biography.jrank.org|access-date=13 February 2010}}</ref>

Stewart's first book to be published was ''The Thought Domain'' (1988) which was then followed by a number of other children's and young adult novels, chiefly in the thriller, horror and SF/Fantasy genres.<ref name=Achuka/> Stewart's only adult book to date, ''Trek'', was published in 1991.<ref name=JRank/>

==Literary influences==

Stewart's favourite books when a child were ''[[The Phantom Tollbooth]]'' by [[Norton Juster]], [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'', ''[[Rupert Bear]]'' Annuals, and the works of [[Alan Garner]], especially ''[[Elidor]]''. He also read a lot of [[science fiction]].<ref name=Q&A/>

Stewart started writing at a very young age. At the age of seven he was writing a series about a snail called Oliver and he started a sequel to ''The Phantom Tollbooth'' at ten. Some of the ideas from this early work were later developed and became the basis of ''The Thought Domain'' which was published in 1988.<ref name=JRank/>

==Collaboration with Chris Riddell==

[[File:Chris Riddell Feb 2010.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Chris Riddell, Illustrator, photo.| Riddell in 2010]]

Stewart first met [[Chris Riddell]] in 1993,<ref name=Q&A/> through having children at the same school.<ref name= DeathRay>{{Citation|title =Postcards from the Edge|journal=Death Ray|volume=18|issue=April/May 2009|pages=34–35|date=April 2009}}</ref> Riddell was looking for someone to write texts that he could illustrate. Stewart had already had a number of books published. Their first collaborative work were the ''Rabbit and Hedgehog'' books (published 1998–2003 by [[Andersen Press]]).<ref name=JRank/> The inspiration for The Edge Chronicles came from a map Riddell drew of an imaginary world in 1994 and then challenged Stewart to write about it.<ref name=Achuka/><ref name=Writing/> The first book in the sequence, ''Beyond the Deepwoods'', was commissioned by Transworld Publishers (now part of the [[Random House]] Group) on the basis of the map and the first four chapters. The book then took three years to write as Stewart and Riddell worked out both the plot and how best to work together.<ref name=Achuka/> Originally commissioned as a single book, Stewart and Riddell hoped that it might become a trilogy.<ref name=Q&A/> The series has now extended to fifteen full-length novels, five short stories, a book of maps and a now-defunct blog called ''Weird New Worlds''. The final book, ''The Descenders'', was released in 2019.

When writing together, Stewart and Riddell work on the development of plots and characters together, sometimes starting from a bit of writing, sometimes from an illustration on one of Riddell's sketchbooks.<ref name="Booktrust" /> They have long conversations over many days, during which the novels emerge.<ref name=Q&A/><ref name=DeathRay/>  They don't always agree and the debates can become quite heated but they have remained good friends.<ref name=Q&A/> Following these discussions, Stewart normally writes a first draft, which Riddell will edit or rewrite before Stewart produces a final draft.<ref name=Booktrust/>

As well as ''The Edge Chronicles'', Stewart and Riddell have also collaborated on a trilogy of shorter adventures, ''Freelance''; a quartet of younger books, ''The Far Flung Adventures'', the first of which, ''Fergus Crane'', won the [[Nestlé Smarties Book Prize]] (Gold Medal) in 2004;<ref name=Booktrust/> ''The Blobheads'' series (2000–2004); ''Muddle Earth'' (2003), and a further quartet, ''Barnaby Grimes'' (2007–2009). Their latest novel, ''Wyrmeweald'' trilogy, was published by Doubleday Children's Books in April 2010.
