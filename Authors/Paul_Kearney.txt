==Life==
Kearney was born in [[Ballymena]], Northern Ireland, in 1967. He studied [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]], [[Middle English]], and [[Old Norse]] at [[Oxford University]] before spending several years in both the United States and [[Denmark]] before returning to Northern Ireland. He currently lives and writes in [[County Down]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Paul Kearney books on Amazon|url=http://www.paulkearneyonline.com/biog.htm|publisher=www.paulkearneyonline.com|accessdate=28 July 2016}}</ref>

==Writings==
Kearney made his name with the stand-alone [[novel]]s ''The Way to Babylon'' (1992), ''A Different Kingdom'' (1993) and ''Riding the Unicorn'' (1994). All these novels had some common threads, most notably the use of a hero from our world who journeys into a fantastical one. Despite strong [[review]]s, these books had commercially disappointing sales,<ref>{{cite web|title=The SF Site: A Conversation With Paul Kearney|url=http://www.sfsite.com/08a/pk109.htm|publisher=www.sfsite.com|accessdate=28 July 2016}}</ref> and Kearney was asked to consider a more traditional fantasy epic. The outcome was the ''[[Monarchies of God]]'', which brought him a measure of success, and ran to five volumes.

After finishing the ''Monarchies'' series, Kearney embarked on a new series, ''[[The Sea Beggars]]'', which began with ''The Mark of Ran'' (2004) and tells the story of Rol Cortishane. It is based almost entirely around ocean-based [[adventure]]s. A second volume, ''This Forsaken Earth'', was published in July 2006. The series was expected to be four books long and the third had nearly been completed when the series was unexpectedly dropped by Bantam in May 2007. However, Kearney was quickly signed-up by publisher Solaris Books, who contracted him to write a new fantasy epic entitled ''The Ten Thousand'' and based loosely on the [[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]] of [[Xenophon]]. This book was published in August 2008. Solaris also re-issued the ''Monarchies of God'' series as a two-volume omnibus edition and intends to publish the finished ''Sea Beggars'' series as soon as Bantam give up the publishing rights. Kearney has also written a tie-in novel based on the ''[[Primeval (TV series)|Primeval]]'' TV series.

In 2009, after a hiatus brought about by Solaris' purchase by Rebellion Books, Kearney was contracted for two additional books set in the world of ''The Ten Thousand'' and the ''Monarchies'' omnibuses was scheduled for late 2010 publication.<ref name="Fantasy Book Review news"/>

In 2009 Kearney was longlisted for the inaugural David Gemmell Legend Award for Best Fantasy Novel.<ref>{{cite web|title=The final 2008 longlist for the David Gemmell Legends Award|url=http://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/blog/2009/01/01/the-final-2008-longlist-for-the-david-gemmell-legends-award/|publisher=Fantasy Book Review blog|accessdate=28 July 2016|date=1 January 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206214205/http://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/blog/2009/01/01/the-final-2008-longlist-for-the-david-gemmell-legends-award/|archivedate=6 February 2009}}</ref>
