'''John Colton''' (December 31, 1887 &ndash; December 26, 1946) was an American playwright and [[screenwriter]] born in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He spent the first 14 years of his life in [[Japan]] where his English father was a diplomat. After returning to the US he soon worked for a [[Minneapolis]] newspaper.

He is best remembered for adapting, with [[Clemence Randolph]], [[Somerset Maugham]]'s novella ''[[Rain (short story)|Rain]]'' into a  1922 smash hit play starring [[Jeanne Eagels]]. He wrote the original play, ''The Shanghai Gesture,'' produced on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1926. He excelled at writing plays dealing with Americans in far-off lands, an experience Colton knew firsthand from his early youth in Japan. With these huge successes Colton was lured to [[Hollywood]], primarily [[MGM]], where he wrote [[intertitle]]s for some [[silent films|silent]] films and scenarios for others. In the [[talkie|talking film]] era he wrote numerous screenplays. Three of his stage plays found motion picture production: ''[[Rain (1932 film)|Rain]]'' (1932); ''[[The Shanghai Gesture]]'' (1941); and, posthumously, ''[[Under Capricorn]]'' (1949).

His 1933 play ''Nine Pine Street'', written with [[Carleton Miles]], was based around the [[Lizzie Borden]] story. Lizzie Borden's character was changed to "Effie Holden", played by [[Lillian Gish]]. It ran for only 28 performances.<ref>{{Cite book|last=1932-|first=Lachman, Marvin|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/903807427|title=The villainous stage : crime plays on Broadway and in the West End|date=2014|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-9534-4|oclc=903807427}}</ref>
