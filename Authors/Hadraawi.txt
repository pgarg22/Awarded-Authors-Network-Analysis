==Biography==
Hadrawi was born in [[Burco]], situated in the [[Togdheer]] region of [[Somaliland]]. He hails from the [[Mohamed Abokor|Ahmed Farah]] sub-division of the [[Habar Jeclo]] clan of the [[Isaaq]].<ref>[http://myhero.com/go/hero.asp?hero=Hadraawi_06 HADRAWI (MOHAMED IBRAHIM WARSAME)]</ref> His family was poor and consisted of one girl and eight boys. In 1953, at the age of nine, he went to live with an uncle in the [[Yemen]]i port city of [[Aden]]. There, Warsame began attending a local school where he received the nickname "Hadrawi" (''Abu Hadra''), a [[pseudonym]] by which he is now popularly known. In 1963, he became a primary school teacher.

==Return to Somalia==
After Somalia gained independence, Hadrawi relocated from [[Aden]] to [[Mogadishu]], Somalia's capital, and began working for Radio Mogadiscio. In Mogadishu, he both attended and later taught at Lafoole (Afgooye) University. He also worked for the government's Department of Information.

In addition to love lyrics, he was a powerful commentator on the political situation and critic of the then military regime in Somalia. Imprisoned between 1973 and 1978.<ref name="McConnell" />

In 1973, Hadrawi wrote the poem ''Siinley'' and the play ''Tawaawac'' ("Lament"), both of which were critical of the military government that was then in power. For this dissent, he was subsequently arrested and imprisoned in Qansax Dheere until April 1978.

==Somali National Movement==
Following his release from prison in 1978, Hadrawi became the director of the [[arts]] division of the Academy of Science, Arts, and Literature in Somalia. when he joined the opposition [[Somali National Movement]] based in Ethiopia. He was a very powerful voice in the ensuing years of civil war and the repressive military regime, and continues to be a very important poet commenting on the predicament the Somalis face.<ref name="McConnell" />

Hadrawi relocated to [[Great Britain]] in 1991. During this period, he traveled frequently throughout [[Europe]] and [[North America]] to participate in [[folklore]] and [[poetry]] festivals.

In 1999, Hadrawi returned once more to his native Somaliland, this time settling in [[Hargeisa]]. The following year, the mayor of [[Chicago]] invited him to participate in the latter city's [[Millennium Festival]].

Hadrawi now lives in Burco, and has reportedly made the pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] ([[hajj]]).

==Contributions to popular music==
Besides volumes of poems and dozens of plays, Hadrawi has participated in numerous collaborations with popular vocal artists. His lyrical corpus includes:

*''Baladweyn'' - song performed by [[Hasan Adan Samatar]] in 1974
*''Saxarlaay ha Fududaan'' - sung by [[Mohamed Mooge Liibaan]]
*''Jacayl Dhiig ma Lagu Qoraa?'' - sung by [[Magool]], and later translated by Hanna Barket as "Is Love Written in Blood?" or "Do You Write Love in Blood?". Another translation of the song by the British linguist and [[Somali Studies]] doyen [[Martin Orwin]] is "Has Love Been Blood-written?".<ref>{{cite journal|title=Maxamed Ibraahim Warsame 'Hadraawi' |url=http://www.poetrymagazines.org.uk/magazine/record.asp?id=12338 | journal=Modern Poetry in Translation |issue=17 - 2001 |issn=0969-3572}}</ref>
