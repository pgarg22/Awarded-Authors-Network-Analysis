'''Peter Lamborn Wilson''' (born 1945) is an American [[anarchist]] author and poet, primarily known for his concept of [[Temporary Autonomous Zone]]s, short-lived spaces which elude formal structures of control.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Marcus|first=Ezra|date=2020-07-01|title=In the Autonomous Zones|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/style/autonomous-zone-anarchist-community.html|access-date=2021-08-29|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> During the 1970s, Wilson lived in the Middle East, where he explored mysticism and translated Persian texts. Starting from the 1980s he wrote (under the [[pen name]] of '''''Hakim Bey''''') numerous political writings, illustrating his theory of "ontological anarchy". His style of anarchism has drawn criticism for its emphasis on individualism and mysticism, as did some writings where he defended [[pederasty]].

==Life==
While undertaking a classics major at Columbia University, Wilson met [[Warren Tartaglia]], then introducing Islam to students as the leader of a group called the Noble Moors. Attracted by the philosophy, Wilson was initiated into the group, but later joined a group of breakaway members who founded the [[Moorish Orthodox Church of America|Moorish Orthodox Church]]. The Church maintained a presence at the [[League for Spiritual Discovery]], the group established by [[Timothy Leary]].

Appalled by the social and political climate, Wilson had also decided to leave America, and shortly after the [[assassination of Martin Luther King]], Jr., in 1968 he flew to Lebanon, eventually reaching India with the intention of studying [[Sufism]], but became fascinated by [[Tantra]], tracking down [[Ganesh Baba]]. He spent a month in a [[Kathmandu]] missionary hospital being treated for [[hepatitis]], and practised meditation techniques in a cave above the east bank of the [[Ganges]]. He also allegedly ingested significant quantities of cannabis.<ref name="Knight">Knight, Michael M. ''William S. Burroughs vs. The Qur'an'', Soft Skull Press, Berkley 2012, pp11-78</ref>

Wilson travelled on to Pakistan. There he lived in several places, mixing with princes, Sufis, and gutter dwellers, and moving from teahouses to opium dens. In [[Quetta]] he found "a total disregard of all government", with people reliant on family, clans or tribes, which appealed to him.<ref name="Knight" />

Wilson then moved to Iran. It was here that he developed his scholarship. He translated classical Persian texts with French scholar [[Henry Corbin]], and also worked as a journalist at the ''Tehran Journal''. In 1974, [[Farah Pahlavi|Farah Pahlavi Empress of Iran]] commissioned her personal secretary, scholar [[Hossein Nasr|Seyyed Hossein Nasr]], to establish the [[Imperial Iranian Academy of Philosophy]]. Nasr offered Wilson the position of director of its English language publications, and editorship of its journal ''Sophia Perennis''. This Wilson edited from 1975 until 1978.<ref name="Knight" />

Following the [[Iranian Revolution]] in 1979, Wilson lived in New York, sharing a brownstone townhouse with [[William Burroughs]], with whom he bonded over their shared interests. Burroughs acknowledged Wilson for providing material on [[Hassan-i Sabbah]] which he used for his novel ''[[The Western Lands]]''.<ref name="Knight" />

Wilson currently lives in upstate New York. A family trust fund enables him to live in a state he terms "independently poor".<ref name="Knight" /> He has been described as "a subcultural monument".<ref>Jarrett, Earnest ''Living Under Sick Machines: Peter Lamborn Wilson / Hakim Bey'', The Brooklyn Rail, 5 June 2014; http://www.brooklynrail.org/2014/06/art/hakim-bey-with-jarrett-earnest</ref>

==Hakim Bey==

Wilson took an interest in the 'zines' subculture flourishing in Manhattan in the early 1980s, 'zines' being tiny hand-made xeroxed magazines published in small quantities concerning whatever the publishers found compelling. "He began writing essays, ''communiqués'' as he liked to call them, under the pen name Hakim Bey, which he mailed to friends and publishers of the 'zines' he liked.... His mailouts were immediately popular, and regarded as copyright-free syndicated columns ready for anyone to paste into their xeroxed 'zines'..."<ref>Rabinowitz, Jacob ''Blame It On Blake: A Memoir of Dead Languages, Gender Vagrancy, Burroughs, Ginsberg, Corso & Carr'' (2019),{{ISBN|1095139053}}, pages 163-165</ref>

Wilson's occasional pen name of ''Hakim Bey'' is derived from il-Hakim, the alchemist-king, with 'Bey' a further nod to Moorish Science. Wilson's two personas, as himself and Bey, are facilitated by his publishers who provide separate author biographies even when both appear in the same publication.<ref>Knight, Michael M. ''William S. Burroughs vs. The Qur'an'', Soft Skull Press, Berkley 2012, p74</ref>

His ''Temporary Autonomous Zones'' work has been referenced in comparison to the "[[free party]]" or [[teknival]] scene of the [[rave]] subculture.<ref name="Maas2015">{{cite book|last=Maas|first=Sander van|title=Thresholds of Listening: Sound, Technics, Space|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U0eHCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA231|year=2015|publisher=Fordham University Press|isbn=978-0-8232-6439-1|page=231}}</ref> Wilson has been supportive of the rave connection, while remarking in an interview, "The ravers were among my biggest readers ... I wish they would rethink all this techno stuff — they didn't get that part of my writing."<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.brooklynrail.org/2004/07/express/an-anarchist-in-the-hudson-valley-br-pet | title=An Anarchist in the Hudson Valley | journal=Brooklyn Rail | date=July 2004}}</ref>

More recently, he has commented on the [[Occupy Movement]] in an interview with David Levi Strauss of ''[[The Brooklyn Rail]]'':

<blockquote>I was beginning to feel that there would never be another American uprising, that the energy was gone, and I have some reasons to think that might be true. I like to point out that the crime rate in America has been declining for a long time, and in my opinion it's because Americans don't even have enough gumption to commit crimes anymore: the creative aspect of crime has fallen into decay. As for the uprising that takes a principled stand against violence, hats off to them, I admire the idealism, but I don't think it's going to accomplish much.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Levi Strauss | first=David | title=In Conversation with Peter Lamborn Wilson | journal=The Brooklyn Rail | url=http://www.brooklynrail.org/2012/10/art/peter-lamborn-wilson-with-tyler-akers-rabia-ashfaque-carina-badalamenti-matthew-farina-jessica-holmes-candy-koh-naomi-lev-david-levi-strauss-sabrina-locks-tara-stickley-erin-sutphin-terrence-trouillot-and-david-willis | date=October 2012}}</ref></blockquote>

In another interview with David Levi Strauss and Christopher Bamford in ''The Brooklyn Rail'', Bey has discussed his views on what he calls "Green Hermeticism": 
<blockquote>We all agreed that there is not a sufficient spiritual focus for the environmental movement. And without a spiritual focus, a movement like this doesn't generate the kind of emotional energy that it needs to battle against global capitalism—that for which there is no other reality, according to most people. It should be a rallying call of the spirit for the environmental movement, or for as many parts of that movement as could be open to it.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Levi Strauss | first=David | title=Green Hermeticism: David Levi Strauss in conversation with Peter Lamborn Wilson and Christopher Bamford | journal=The Brooklyn Rail |date=January 2008 | url=http://brooklynrail.org/2007/12/art/green-hermeticism}}</ref></blockquote>

==Notable theories==

===Ontological anarchy===
In the compilation of essays called "Immediatism"<ref>''Immediatism'' by Hakim Bey. AK Press. 1994.</ref> Wilson explains his particular conception of anarchism and anarchy which he calls "ontological anarchy". In the same compilation he deals with his view of the relationships of individuals with the exterior world as perceived by the senses and a theory of liberation which he calls "immediatism".

===Temporary autonomous zones===
{{Main|Temporary Autonomous Zone}}

Wilson has written articles on three different types of what he calls temporary autonomous zones (TAZ). Regarding his concept of TAZ, he said in an interview the following: <blockquote>... the real genesis was my connection to the communal movement in America, my experiences in the 1960s in places like [[Timothy Leary]]'s commune in Millbrook ... Usually only the religious ones last longer than a generation—and usually at the expense of becoming quite authoritarian, and probably dismal and boring as well. I've noticed that the exciting ones tend to disappear, and as I began to further study this phenomenon, I found that they tend to disappear in a year or a year and a half.<ref>[http://www.e-flux.com/journal/in-conversation-with-hakim-bey/ Hans Ulrich Obrist. "In Conversation with Hakim Bey" at e-flux]</ref></blockquote>

In an article on obsessive love, Wilson posited a utopia based on generosity as well as obsession and wrote:

<blockquote>I have dreamed this (I remember it suddenly, as if it were literally a dream) — and it has taken on a tantalizing reality and filtered into my life—in certain Temporary Autonomous Zones—an "impossible" time and space ... and on this brief hint, all my theory is based.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hermetic.com/bey/obsessive-love.html|title=Obsessive Love — Hakim Bey|website=Hermetic Library|access-date=2016-08-26}}</ref></blockquote>

As such, it may be said that it is part of the eternal vision of an arcadia where desires are fulfilled without reference to the world, and the search for a means of realising it.

The concept of TAZ was presented in a long elaboration in the book ''TAZ: The Temporary Autonomous Zone, Ontological Anarchy, Poetic Terrorism''.<ref>Hakim Bey. ''TAZ: The Temporary Autonomous Zone, Ontological Anarchy, Poetic Terrorism.'' Autonomedia. August 1991</ref>

==Criticism and controversy==
[[Murray Bookchin]] included Wilson's work (as Bey) in what he called "[[lifestyle anarchism]]", which he criticized Wilson's writing for tendencies towards [[mysticism]], [[occultism]], and [[irrationalism]].<ref>Bookchin, Murray. ''Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism'' (1995). [[AK Press]]: [[Stirling]]. {{ISBN|978-1-873176-83-2}}. (pp. 20-26)</ref> Wilson did not respond publicly. [[Bob Black]] wrote a rejoinder to Bookchin in ''Anarchy after Leftism''.

Some writers have been troubled by Bey's endorsement of adults having sex with children.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/lifestyle/blogcritics/article/Book-Review-William-S-Burroughs-vs-The-Qur-an-3530181.php |title=Book Review: William S. Burroughs vs. The Qur'an by Michael Muhammad Knight |last=Marcus |first=Richard |date=2 May 2012 |website=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |publisher=[[Hearst (media)|Hearst Communications]] |access-date=14 March 2017}}</ref> [[Michael Muhammad Knight]], a novelist and former friend of Wilson, stated that "writing for NAMBLA amounts to activism in real life. As Hakim Bey, Peter creates a child molester's liberation theology and then publishes it for an audience of potential offenders"<ref name="Knight2012">{{cite book|author=Michael Knight|title=William S. Burroughs vs. The Qur'an|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f-Idml4Zg3oC&pg=PA85|date=17 April 2012|publisher=[[Soft Skull Press]]|isbn=978-1-59376-415-9|pages=85–86|quote=He doesn't know that I've read the NAMBLA poems or ''Crowstone'' or that I would have a problem with it. I'm not a liar yet, because at least I'm trying to work this out for myself. But it doesn't look good. I try to see it as Sufi allegory, a hidden parable somewhere in all the porn, like Ibn 'Arabi's poems about Nizam or Rumi's donkey-sex story. Does anyone accuse Rumi of bestiality? Apart from the ugly ''zahir'' meaning, the surface-level interpretation, there could be a secret ''batin'' meaning, and the boys aren't really boys but personifications of Divine Names. It almost settles things for me, but writing for NAMBLA amounts to activism in real life. As Hakim Bey, Peter creates a child molester's liberation theology and then publishes it for an audience of potential offenders. The historical settings that he uses for validation, whether Mediterranean pirates or medieval fringe Sufis, relate less to homosexuality than to prison rape: heterosexual males with physical and/or material power but no access to women, claiming whatever warm holes are available. What Hakim Bey calls "alternative sexuality" is in fact only old patriarchy–the man with the beard expressing his power through penetration. His supporters might dismiss "childhood" as a mere construction of the post-industrial age, but Hakim Bey forces me to consider that once in a while, I have to side with the awful modern world.}}</ref> and disavowed his former mentor.<ref name="Fiscella2009">{{cite book|last=Fiscella|first=Anthony|editor=Alexandre J.
