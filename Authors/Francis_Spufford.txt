It is influenced by science fiction, and uses many of its tools, but is not itself science fiction.

Spufford has also edited three anthologies: ''The Chatto Book of Cabbages and Kings'', 1989, about lists used as a literary device, ''The Chatto Book of the Devil'', 1993, and ''The Antarctic'', 2008.

In March 2019, it was reported that Spufford had written a novel, ''The Stone Table'', set in the universe of [[C. S. Lewis]]’s [[Narnia]] series, during the time between ''[[The Magician's Nephew]]'' and ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]''. Spufford distributed self-printed copies to friends. The novel was praised as a "seamless recreation of Lewis’s writing-style", and Spufford hoped to obtain permission from the C. S. Lewis estate to publish it commercially. In the absence of permission, the earliest publication date would be 2034, seventy years after Lewis’s death, when the copyright on the original books expires in the UK.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/19/francis-spufford-pens-unauthorised-narnia-novel |title=Francis Spufford pens unauthorised Narnia novel |work=[[The Guardian]] |author=Richard Lea |date=19 March 2019 |accessdate=21 March 2019}}</ref>
