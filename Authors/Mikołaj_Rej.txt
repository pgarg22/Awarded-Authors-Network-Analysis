'''Mikołaj Rej''' or '''Mikołaj Rey''' of [[Nagłowice]] (4 February 1505 – between 8 September/5 October 1569) was a Polish poet and [[prose]] writer of the emerging [[Renaissance in Poland]] as it succeeded the [[Middle Ages in Poland|Middle Ages]], as well as a politician and musician. He was the first Polish author to write exclusively in the [[Polish language]], and is considered (with [[Biernat of Lublin]] and [[Jan Kochanowski]]), to be one of the founders of [[Polish literature|Polish literary language and literature]].<ref name="polona.pl">[http://www.polona.pl/dlibra/collectiondescription2?dirids=22 Mikołaj Rej collection (with biography and body of works), ''National Digital Library'' (Cyfrowa Biblioteka Narodowa ''Polona''), 2006.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903123328/http://www.polona.pl/dlibra/collectiondescription2?dirids=22 |date=September 3, 2011 }} {{in lang|en}}</ref>

==Life==
Rej was born into a noble family (bearers of the [[Oksza coat of arms]]) at [[Zhuravno|Żurawno]], near [[Halicz]]. His father Stanisław, "a pious, honourable, and quiet man", had (with the help of a relative who was Archbishop of Lwów), moved to [[Kievan Rus'|Ruthenia]] from [[Nagłowice]], near [[Kraków]] at the invitation of archbishop Jan Wątróbka. His mother, Barbara Herburt, married Rej's father there as his second wife.<ref>The Paradoxes of Rej's Biography (pp. 215-237), Wiktor Weintraub, in Indiana Slavic Studies, vol. IV, Indiana University, 1967, p. 216</ref> Although young Rej received little formal education in [[Lwów]], and, at the age of 13 attended but one year at the [[Jagiellonian University|Kraków Academy]], he managed to educate himself by studying [[Latin literature]].<ref name="polona.pl"/>

In approximately 1524, Rej began his service at the court of voivode Andrzej Tęczyński in Sandomierz. There, he acquired most of his vast knowledge in the field of humanities. He returned to his family's town of Topola and married Zofia Kosnówna (Kościeniówna). In 1531 Rej moved to Kobyle, in the [[Chełm]] area, which had been bequeathed to his wife, and thereafter, he frequented the court of [[Hetman]] [[Mikołaj Sieniawski]]. In either 1541 or 1548, Rej converted to [[Calvinism]]. He took part in [[synod]]s and founded [[Protestant]] schools and communities on his lands.<ref name="polona.pl"/>
 
Rej took part in [[sejm]]s and thought his writing an important social mission. He was the first Polish writer to receive a substantial reward for his output. By the end of his life, he owned several villages and oversaw many. He received [[:uk:Темирівці|Temerowce]] from King [[Sigismund I the Old]], and [[Dziewięciele]] from King [[Sigismund II Augustus]] as a lifelong possession and two towns, one of them [[Rejowiec, Lublin Voivodeship|Rejowiec]], founded by Rej in 1547. Living during the [[Golden Liberty]] embraced by the [[Szlachta|Polish nobility]], tolerance characterized his oversight and this philosophy was carried on by his sons. Rej died at Rejowiec in 1569.

On the five-hundredth anniversary of his birth, Mikolaj Rej was described as a "father of Polish literature",<ref>Urban, Prof. dr hab. Waclaw, translated by Jagoda Urban-Klaehn and Nancy J. Maciolek, Polish-American Journal, 
August 2005 edition [http://culture.polishsite.us/articles/art343.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728085623/http://culture.polishsite.us/articles/art343.html |date=July 28, 2014 }}</ref> and it also was noted that his grandson, [[Andrzej Rej (diplomat)]], royal secretary and Calvinist, is Mikolaj's most prominent offspring. That grandson may be the subject of the 1637 painting by [[Rembrandt]], ''[[A Polish Nobleman]]'' (perhaps, painted while he was visiting Amsterdam during a trip as a Polish ambassador on a diplomatic mission to the courts of the Danish, the English, and the Dutch).<ref>Dunin-Borkowski, Jerzy Seweryn, ''Successful Families of Living Polish Genealogies'', Lviv, 1895</ref><ref>Radziwill, Boguslaw, ''Autobiography'', Introduction by Tadeusz Wasilewski, Warsaw, 1979.</ref>

In 1543 Rej debuted as a writer, under the pen name "Ambroży Korczbok Rożek," with his most famous book, ''A Brief Discussion among Three Persons: a Lord, a Commune Chief, and a Priest'' (''Krotka rozprawa między trzemi osobami, panem, woytem a plebanem'').<ref name="polona.pl-2">Rej, Mikołaj (1505–1569), [http://www.polona.pl/dlibra/doccontent2?id=43&from=pubstats  "Krotka rozprawa między trzemi osobami, panem, woytem a plebanem"], ''National Digital Library''; retrieved 28 September 2011.</ref>

Rej's works touch on a large array of matters. He authored [[prose]] works that described the ideal of the Polish [[szlachcic|nobleman]], criticized the [[Catholic Church]], and showed a genuine solicitude for his country. His [[prose]] [[syntax]] is strongly influenced by [[Latin]] style.

His [[meter (poetry)|poetic meter]] discloses a deliberate effort to impart to the [[medieval]] metrical model with which he was so familiar, a regularity that it lacked. Rej's works include:
* ''Krótka rozprawa między trzema osobami: Panem, Wójtem i Plebanem'' (A Brief Discussion among Three Persons: a Lord, a Commune Chief, and a Priest, 1543), written under the pen name, ''Ambroży Korczbok Rożek'' 
* ''Żywot Józefa'' (The Life of Joseph, 1545).
* ''Żywot Człowieka Poczciwego'' (The Life of the Honest Man) 
* ''Kupiec'' (The Merchant, 1549) 
* ''Zwierzyniec'' (The Bestiary, 1562) 
* ''Zwierciadło'' ([[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]]), incorporating the three-book prose ''Wizerunek własny żywota człowieka poczciwego'' (''The Image of a Good Man's Life'', 1567–68) 
* ''Rzecz pospolita albo Sejm pospolity'' (The Commonwealth, or the General Sejm)

"''A niechaj narodowie wżdy postronni znają,''<br> 
''iż Polacy nie gęsi, iż swój język mają.''"<br>

"Let it by all and sundry foreign nations be known<br>
that Poles speak not Anserine but a tongue of their own."<ref>From Rej's "''Do tego co czytał''" ("To What He Read," 1562). Rej, the first Polish author to write exclusively in the [[Polish language]], proposed that Poles break with the tradition, current in the [[Renaissance in Poland|Renaissance]], of writing in [[Latin]]—a language that reminded him of the [[:Wiktionary:gabble|gabbling]] of [[geese]]. It has been argued that Rej here uses "''gęsi''" not as a [[noun]] ("[[geese]]") but as an [[adjective]] ("[[Anserinae|anserine]]"); thus, rather than saying, "that Poles are no geese—they have a language of their own," as some have understood Rej's verse, he would be saying, "that Poles speak not [[Anserinae|Anserine]] [i.e., [[Latin]]] but a tongue of their own."</ref>

In commemoration of the five-hundredth anniversary of the birth of Mikołaj Rej, Poland's [[Sejm]] (parliament) declared 2005 to be ''the Year of Mikołaj Rej''. 

In 1994–97, Rej's descendant and namesake, [[Nicholas Andrew Rey]] (1938–2009), served as American Ambassador to [[Poland]].
