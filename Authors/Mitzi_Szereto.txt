==The Thelonious T. Bear Chronicles series==
Since 2012, Szereto has "co-authored" the [[cozy mystery]]/satire series with her "celebrity" teddy bear [[Teddy Tedaloo]]. The series follows the (mis)adventures of protagonist Thelonious T. Bear, a Mini-Cooper driving photojournalist bear from England who must co-exist in the human world. The novels are set in various locations around the world and feature a cast of quirky characters. The books include:
*''Rotten Peaches (The Thelonious T. Bear Chronicles)'' (2015), which takes place in the rural American South. An armed gang of "little people" wearing animal masks are on a bank-robbing spree, and Thelonious gets mistaken for one of the bandits.
*''Normal for Norfolk (The Thelonious T. Bear Chronicles)'' (2012), which is set in the Norfolk countryside in England. Village pub landlords are being murdered, and Thelonious keeps turning up in the vicinity of the crimes, attracting the attention of an incompetent detective chief inspector.
