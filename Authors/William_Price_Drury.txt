Lieutenant-Colonel '''William Price Drury''', [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (8 November 1861 – 21 January 1949) was a [[Royal Marine Light Infantry]] officer, novelist and playwright. He served as Mayor of [[Saltash]] from 1929 to 1931.

==Life==
Drury was educated at [[Brentwood School (England)|Brentwood School]], [[Essex]], and at [[Plymouth College]]. He was commissioned a [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]] in the [[Royal Marines Light Infantry]] on 1 September 1880 and promoted to [[Captain (BARM)|captain]] on 2 January 1890.<ref>Hart′s Army list, 1903</ref> During his Royal Marines career, he served on the [[China Station]] and with the [[Mediterranean Fleet (United Kingdom)|Mediterranean Fleet]]. He commanded the Royal Marines from [[HMS Camperdown (1885)|HMS ''Camperdown'']] and [[HMS Astraea (1893)|HMS ''Astraea'']], which landed in [[Crete]] after local Christians and British soldiers were massacred by Turkish [[Bashi-bazouk]] forces in 1898, and was promoted to [[Major (British Army and Royal Marines)|major]] on 12 December 1898.

He was appointed to the [[Naval Intelligence Department]] in March 1900,<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=27176 |date=23 March 1900|page=1967}}</ref> and served until he was placed on [[half-pay]] on 1 July 1902 due to medical unfitness.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=27465 |date=15 August 1902|page=5331|supp=}}</ref> He then resigned to pursue his literary career. At the outbreak of [[World War I]], he rejoined the Royal Marines and served as an [[intelligence officer]] at [[Plymouth]].<ref>''Who Was Who 1941–1952 Volume IV'', 1952, A & C Black.</ref>

Drury's mother-in-law was the romantic novelist [[Mrs. Pender Cudlip]].<ref>Sutherland, John, ''The Stanford Companion to Victorian Fiction'', 1989, Stanford University Press, p. 165.</ref> The actress [[Ruth Kettlewell]] was his niece.

==Work==
Drury was the author of a range of plays and novels, many with naval themes. Perhaps his best known play, ''The Flag Lieutenant'', was filmed three times: twice as a silent film – in 1919 by [[Percy Nash]] and in [[The Flag Lieutenant (1932 film)|1926]] by [[Maurice Elvey]], and then again with sound in 1932 by [[Henry Edwards (actor)|Henry Edwards]]. ''[[The Further Adventures of the Flag Lieutenant]]'' was also filmed in 1927, after the huge success of Elvey's adaptation.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0238652/ Internet Movie Database]</ref>

The preface of Drury's collection ''The Tadpole of an Archangel'' helped to popularise the expression ''[[Tell it to the Marines]].'' Drury attributed the phrase to [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], reporting that he had made the remark to [[Samuel Pepys]]. Drury later admitted this was a fabrication.<ref name=neversaid>{{Cite book |last=Boller, Jr. |first=Paul F.; George, John |title=They Never Said It: a Book of Fake Quotes, Misquotes, and Misleading Attributions |year=1990 |publisher=OUP |location=New York, NY [u.a.] |isbn=0195064690 |edition=1. issued as paperback. |page=103}}</ref>
Drury also wrote a poem entitled ''The Dead Marines'' in tribute to the Royal Marines, after the [[William IV of the United Kingdom|Duke of Clarence]] supposedly called empty alcohol bottles "Dead Marines".

The Royal Marines Barracks at [[Stonehouse, Plymouth]] have a Drury Room containing his desk and memorabilia. Many items from the Drury Room are now on display at Saltash Heritage Museum and Local History Centre.<ref>[http://www.saltash-heritage.co.uk/Issue29.php Saltash Heritage Newsletter #29.]</ref>
