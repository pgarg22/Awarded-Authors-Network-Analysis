'''Béroul''' was a [[Normans|Norman]] or [[Bretons|Breton]] poet of the 12th century. He wrote ''Tristan'', a [[Norman language]] version of the legend of [[Tristan and Iseult]] of which a certain number of fragments (approximately 3000 verses) have been preserved; it is the earliest representation of the so-called "vulgar" version of the legend (the "courtly" version being represented by fragments from [[Thomas of Britain]]'s poem). [[Eilhart von Oberge]] wrote a treatment of this version in [[German language|German]], and many of Béroul's episodes that do not appear in Thomas reappear in the [[Prose Tristan|Prose ''Tristan'']]. Beroul's poem survives in a single manuscript now in the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]] in Paris. This copy is poorly written  and there is a suggestion that part of the poem was written by a different scribe from the rest. The actual content of the poem also differs from the modern conception of what a narrative poem should be; the plot is disjointed and lacking in a flow of cause and effect, and the characters are poorly defined. Nevertheless, Fedrick proposes that this was common of literature in Beroul's time.<ref>Beroul ''The Romance of Tristan'', Introduction and translation by Alan S. Fedrick</ref>
