==Personal life==
Goodrich was born in Belleville, New Jersey, the daughter of Madeleine Christy (née Lloyd) and Henry Wickes Goodrich. The family moved to nearby Nutley, New Jersey when Goodrich was two. She attended [[Collegiate School (New Jersey)|Collegiate School]] in Passaic, New Jersey, and graduated from [[Vassar College]] in 1912, and attended the [[New York School of Social Work]] from 1912 to 1913.

==Career==
Not long after marrying Hackett, the couple settled in Hollywood in the late 1920s to write the screenplay for their stage success ''Up Pops the Devil'' for [[Paramount Pictures]]. In 1933, they signed a contract with [[MGM]] and remained with them until 1939. Among their early assignments was writing the screenplay for ''[[The Thin Man (film)|The Thin Man]]'' (1934). They were encouraged by director [[W.S. Van Dyke]] to use the writing of [[Dashiell Hammett]] as a basis only and to concentrate on providing witty exchanges for the principal characters, [[Nick and Nora Charles]] (played by [[William Powell]] and [[Myrna Loy]]). The resulting film was one of the major hits of the year, and the script was considered to show a modern relationship in a realistic manner for the first time.

The couple received [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Academy Award for Screenplay]] nominations for ''The Thin Man'', ''[[After the Thin Man]]'' (1936), ''[[Father of the Bride (1950 film)|Father of the Bride]]'' (1950) and ''[[Seven Brides for Seven Brothers]]'' (1955). They won [[Writers Guild of America]] awards for ''[[Easter Parade (film)|Easter Parade]]'' (1949), ''[[Father's Little Dividend]]'' (1951), ''Seven Brides for Seven Brothers'' (1954), and ''[[The Diary of Anne Frank (1959 film)|The Diary of Anne Frank]]'' (1959), as well as nominations for ''[[In the Good Old Summertime]]'' (1949), ''Father of the Bride'' (1950) and ''[[The Long, Long Trailer]]'' (1954). They also won a [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] for their play ''[[The Diary of Anne Frank (play)|The Diary of Anne Frank]]''. Some of their other films include: ''[[Another Thin Man]]'' (1939) and ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' (1946).

==Death==
Goodrich died from lung cancer on January 29, 1984 at the age of 93 in New York City.
