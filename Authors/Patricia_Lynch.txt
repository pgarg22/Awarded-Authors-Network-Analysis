==Writing==

The children meet a [[leprechaun]], a [[golden eagle]], the [[Salmon of Wisdom|Salmon of Knowledge]] and [[Fionn mac Cumhaill|Finn]] on their adventure. Some sequels followed.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} It was translated into Irish by [[Maighréad Nic Mhaicín]] as ''Asal fhear na móna'' in 1944.<ref name="Mhunghaile">{{cite book|last1=Ní Mhunghaile|first1=Lesa|title=[[Dictionary of Irish Biography]]|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|editor1-last=McGuire|editor1-first=James|location=Cambridge|chapter=Nic Mhaicín, Maighréad|editor2-last=Quinn|editor2-first=James}}</ref>

Another series of hers is the ''Brogeen'' series, a fantasy children's book series. Here Brogeen is the name of the main character in the book, a leprechaun who keeps running away from his home. It has been read on radio and released as a puppet theatre series on Irish TV.<ref>cf. [[Eugene Lambert]]</ref>

''The Bookshop on the Quay'' is her best-known non-fantasy book. It tells the story of Shane from the country who learns the trade of bookselling at The Four Masters Bookshop in Dublin. The book was read on ''[[Jackanory]]''.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1842462/ Patricia Lynch at the Internet Movie Database]</ref>

She is co-author of ''Lisheen at the Valley Farm and other stories''<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://deevy.nuim.ie/items/show/105 |title=The Teresa Deevy Archive |website=}}</ref> along with [[Teresa Deevy]] and Helen Staunton where she wrote ''Strange People'' a story about a little girl called Meg and her friends.

Lynch's literature, always morally simple, remains praised for its other-worldly depictions of life in the west of Ireland. Her protagonists often encounter characters from Irish folklore, and speak a [[Gaelicisation|Gaelicised]] English reminiscent of [[Lady Gregory]]'s Kiltartan.

[[Marcus Crouch]] in ''The Nesbit Tradition''<ref>Marcus Crouch, ''The Nesbit Tradition: The Children's Novel 1945–1970'' (1972) pp. 182–84.</ref> describes Lynch's work as "the richest and most heart-warming of family stories." He particularly mentions the fantasy ''The Grey Goose of Kilnevin'' and the "homely adventure" ''Fiddler's Quest''.

Her works had many different illustrators, including the renowned artists [[John Butler Yeats]] ''(The Turf-Cutter's Donkey)'' and [[Sean Keating]] ''(The Grey Goose of Kilnevin)''.
