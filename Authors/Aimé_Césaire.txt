His works have been translated into many languages.

==Student, educator and poet==

Aimé Césaire was born in [[Basse-Pointe]], [[Martinique]], [[France]], in 1913. His father was a tax inspector and his mother was a dressmaker. He was a lower class citizen but still learned to read and write.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Ferguson|first=James|date=2008-04-20|title=Obituary: Aimé Césaire|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/21/3|access-date=2020-11-10|website=the Guardian|language=en|quote=Césaire was born at Basse-Pointe, a small town on Martinique's north coast... His family was part of the island's small, black middle class, with his father employed as a tax inspector.}}</ref> His family moved to the capital of Martinique, [[Fort-de-France]], in order for Césaire to attend the only secondary school on the island, Lycée Schoelcher.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Micklin |first1=Anna T. |title=Aimé Cesaire (1913–2008)|url=https://blackpast.org/gah/cesaire-aime-1913-2008 |website=The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed |access-date=12 December 2018|date=2008-05-23 }}</ref> He considered himself of [[Igbo people|Igbo]] descent from [[Nigeria]], and considered his first name ''Aimé'' a retention of an Igbo name; though the name is of French origin, ultimately from the [[Old French]] word ''amée'', meaning beloved, its pronunciation is similar to the Igbo ''eme'', which forms the basis for many Igbo given names.<ref>{{cite news |last=Azuonye |first=Chukwuma |year=1990 |title=Igbo Names in the Nominal Roll of Amelié, An Early 19th Century Slave Ship from Martinique: Reconstructions, Interpretations and Inferences |publisher=University of Massachusetts Boston |page=1 |location=footnote |url=http://scholarworks.umb.edu/africana_faculty_pubs/8/ |access-date=26 March 2015}}</ref> Césaire traveled to [[Paris]] to attend the [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]] on an educational scholarship. In [[Paris]], he passed the entrance exam for the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in 1935 and created the literary review ''[[L'Étudiant noir]]'' (''The Black Student'') with [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]] and [[Léon Damas]]. Manifestos by these three students in its third number (May–June 1935)<ref>{{Cite web|title=letudiant-noir|url=https://letudiantnoir.webs.com/|access-date=2021-09-04|website=letudiant-noir}}</ref> initiated the [[Négritude]] movement later substantial in both pan-Africanist theory and the actual decolonization of the French Empire in Africa. (Cesaire represented Martinique in the French National Assembly for 48 years and Senghor was president for 20 years of independent Senegal.) Upon returning home to Martinique in 1936, Césaire began work on his long poem ''[[Cahier d'un retour au pays natal]] (Notebook of a Return to the Native Land)'', a vivid and powerful depiction of the ambiguities of Caribbean life and culture in the New World.

Césaire married fellow Martinican student [[Suzanne Césaire|Suzanne Roussi]] in 1937. Together they moved back to Martinique in 1939 with their young son. Césaire became a teacher at the Lycée Schoelcher in Fort-de-France, where he taught [[Frantz Fanon]], becoming a great influence for Fanon as both a mentor and contemporary. Césaire also served as an inspiration for, but did not teach, writer [[Édouard Glissant]].

==World War II==

The years of [[World War II]] were ones of great intellectual activity for the Césaires. In 1941, Aimé Césaire and Suzanne Roussi founded the literary review ''[[Tropiques]]'', with the help of other Martinican intellectuals such as [[René Ménil]] and Aristide Maugée, in order to challenge the cultural status quo and alienation that characterized Martinican identity at the time. Césaire's many run-ins with censorship did not deter him, however, from being an outspoken defendant of Martinican identity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brossard|first=Lise|date=2014|title=Que retenir de la revue Tropiques?|url=https://www.cairn.info/revue-la-revue-des-revues-2014-2-page-89.htm|journal=Journée d'Étude du CRILLASH|volume=52|pages=89–91|via=Cairn.info}}</ref> He also became close to French [[Surrealism|surrealist]] poet [[André Breton]], who spent time in Martinique during the war. (The two had met in 1940, and Breton later would champion Cesaire's work.)<ref name=pa20cfv>Auster, Paul (ed.), ''The Random House Book of Twentieth-Century French Poetry: with Translations by American and British Poets'', New York: Random House, 1982. {{ISBN|0-394-52197-8}}.</ref>

In 1947, his book-length poem ''[[Cahier d'un retour au pays natal]]'', which had first appeared in the Parisian periodical ''Volontés'' in 1939 after rejection by a French book publisher,<ref>"Aimé Césaire", in Donald E. Herdeck (ed.), ''Caribbean Writers: A Bio-Bibliographical-Critical Encyclopedia'', Washington, DC: Three Continents Press, 1979, p. 324.</ref> was published.<ref>"Commentary."

''Notebook of a Return to the Native Land'' (Middleton, CT: Wesleyan University Press, 2001), p. xiii.</ref> When asked by [[René Depestre|Rene Depestres]] about his writing style, Césaire replied by saying that "Surrealism provided me with what I had been confusedly searching for."<ref>[http://wallacethinksagain.blogspot.com/2007/11/aime-cesaire-on-surrealism.html "Aime Cesaire on surrealism"].

In 1945, with the support of the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF), Césaire was elected mayor of [[Fort-de-France]] and deputy to the [[French National Assembly]] for Martinique. He managed to get a law addressing departmentalization approved unanimously on 19 March 1946.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Viveros-Vigoya |first1=Mara |title=The political vitality and vital politics of Césaire's Discourse on Colonialism: A reading in light of contemporary racism |journal=The Sociological Review |date=2019 |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=476–491 |doi=10.1177/0038026119868654 |s2cid=203083086 |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0038026119868654 |access-date=6 December 2020}}</ref> While departmentalization was implemented in 1946, the status did not bring many meaningful changes to the people of Martinique.

Like many [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] intellectuals in 1930s and 1940s France, Césaire looked toward the [[Soviet Union]] as a source of progress, virtue, and human rights. He later grew disillusioned with the Soviet Union after the 1956 suppression of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian revolution]]. He announced his resignation from the PCF in a text entitled ''Lettre à [[Maurice Thorez]]'' (Letter to Maurice Thorez). In 1958 Césaire founded the [[Martinican Progressive Party|Parti Progressiste Martiniquais]]. With the Parti Progressiste Martiniquais, he dominated the island’s political scene for the last half of the century. Césaire declined to renew his mandate as deputy in the National Assembly in 1993, after a 47-year continuous term.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Viveros-Vigoya |first1=Mara |title=The political vitality and vital politics of Césaire's Discourse on Colonialism: A reading in light of contemporary racism |journal=The Sociological Review |date=2019 |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=476–491 |doi=10.1177/0038026119868654 |s2cid=203083086 |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0038026119868654 |access-date=6 December 2020}}</ref>

His writings during this period reflect his passion for civic and social engagement. He wrote ''[[Discourse on colonialism|Discours sur le colonialisme]]'' (''Discourse on Colonialism''), a denunciation of European colonial racism, decadence, and hypocrisy that was republished in the French review ''[[Présence Africaine]]'' in 1955 (English translation 1957). In 1960, he published ''[[Toussaint Louverture]]'', based on the life of the [[Haitian Revolution|Haitian revolutionary]]. In 1969, he published the first version of ''[[Une Tempête]]'', a radical adaptation of Shakespeare's play ''[[The Tempest (play)|The Tempest]]'' for a black audience.

Césaire served as [[President of the Regional Council of Martinique]] from 1983 to 1988. He retired from politics in 2001.

==Later life==
In 2006, he refused to meet the leader of the [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (UMP), [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], a probable contender at the time for the [[2007 presidential election]], because the UMP had voted for the 2005 [[French law on colonialism]]. This law required teachers and textbooks to "acknowledge and recognize in particular the positive role of the French presence abroad, especially in North Africa", a law considered by many as a eulogy to [[colonialism]] and French actions during the [[Algerian War]]. President [[Jacques Chirac]] finally had the controversial law repealed.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Lotem|first=Itay|date=25 January 2016|title=A decade after the riots, France has rewritten its colonial history|url=https://theconversation.com/amp/a-decade-after-the-riots-france-has-rewritten-its-colonial-history-50499|access-date=2020-10-24|website=theconversation.com}}</ref>

On 9 April 2008, Césaire had serious heart troubles and was admitted to Pierre Zobda Quitman hospital in Fort-de-France. He died on 17 April 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7352717.stm|title=Caribbean poet Cesaire dies at 94|access-date=17 April 2008|date=17 April 2008|publisher=BBC| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090218180506/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7352717.stm| archive-date=February 18, 2009| url-status= live}}</ref>

Césaire was accorded the honor of a [[state funeral]], held at the [[Stade de Dillon]] in Fort-de-France on 20 April. [[President of France|French President]] Nicolas Sarkozy was present but did not make a speech. The honor of making the funeral oration was left to his old friend [[Pierre Aliker]], who had served for many years as deputy mayor under Césaire.<ref>Le Temps des Tempetes, Nicolas Sarkozy, p. 411.</ref>

===Legacy===
Martinique's airport at [[Le Lamentin]] was renamed [[Martinique Aimé Césaire International Airport]] on 15 January 2007.
A national commemoration ceremony was held on 6 April 2011, as a plaque in Césaire's name was inaugurated in the [[Panthéon]] in [[Paris]].<ref>[http://legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000023720663 "Décret du 16 mars 2011 décidant d'un hommage de la Nation à Aimé Césaire au Panthéon"], ''[[Journal officiel de la République française|JORF]]'' No. 64, 17 March 2011, p. 4839, texte No. 37, [[Système NOR|NOR]]  MCCB1105232D, sur [[Légifrance]].</ref> He was also proclaimed as a national hero in Martinique.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Storey |first1=Thomas |title=Some Thoughts on Aimé Césaire: The Father of Négritude |url=https://theculturetrip.com/caribbean/martinique/articles/aim-c-saire-the-father-of-n-gritude/ |website=Culture Trip |access-date=6 December 2020}}</ref>

Poetically, Césaire's legacy is far-reaching in poetry both from his time and beyond. Most notably, his relation to Frantz Fanon, famed author of ''[[Black Skin, White Masks]]'', as mentor and inspiration is tangible. Fanon's personal testimony in ''Black Skin, White Masks'' explains the "liberating effect of Césaire’s word and action" that he felt in traversing the changing colonial landscape.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Irele |first1=Francis Abiola |title=The Poetic Legacy of Aimé Césaire |journal=French Politics, Culture & Society |date=2009 |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=81–97 |doi=10.3167/fpcs.2009.270310 |jstor=42843618 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/42843618 |access-date=6 December 2020}}</ref> More generally, Césaire's works conceptualized African unity and black culture in ways that allowed for the creation of black spaces where there previously were none, from the establishment of several literary journals to his reworking of Caliban's speech from Shakespeare's ''The Tempest''. Césaire’s works were foundational for postcolonial literature across France, its then colonies, and much of the Caribbean.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Storey |first1=Thomas |title=2016 |url=https://theculturetrip.com/caribbean/martinique/articles/aim-c-saire-the-father-of-n-gritude/ |website=Culture Trip |access-date=6 December 2020}}</ref>

====Discourse on Colonialism====
Césaire's "Discourse on Colonialism"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Césaire |first1=Aimé |title=Discourse on Colonialism |date=1972 |url=http://abahlali.org/files/_Discourse_on_Colonialism.pdf |access-date=11 December 2018}}</ref> challenges the narrative of the colonizer and the colonized. This text criticizes the hypocrisy of justifying [[colonization]] with the equation "Christianity=civilized, paganism=savagery" comparing white colonizers to "savages". Césaire writes that "no one colonizes innocently, that no one colonizes with impunity either" concluding that "a  nation which colonizes, that a civilization which justifies colonization - and therefore force - is already a sick civilization".  He condemns the colonizers, saying that though the men may not be inherently bad, the practice of colonization ruins them.

Césaire's text intertwines slavery, imperialism, capitalism, republicanism, and modernism, stating that they were linked together and influenced one another in undeniable ways. Importantly, all of those oppressive forces came together to hurt the colonized and empower the colonizer. This position was considered radical at the time.

Césaire continues to deconstruct the colonizer, and ultimately concludes that by colonizing those white men often lose touch with who they were, and become brutalized into hidden instincts that result in the rape, torture, and race hatred that they put onto the people they colonize.  He also examines the effects colonialism has on the colonized, stating that "colonization = 'thing-ification'", where because the colonizers are able to [[Other (philosophy)|"other"]] the colonized, they can justify the means by which they colonize.

The text also continuously references [[Nazism]], blaming the barbarism of colonialism and how whitewashed and accepted the tradition, for Hitler's rise to power. He says that Hitler lives within and is the demon of  "the very distinguished, very humanistic, very Christian bourgeois of the twentieth century." Particularly, Césaire argues that Nazism was not an exception or singular event in European history; rather, the natural progression of a civilization that justified colonization without "perceiving the dangers involved in proceeding towards savagery."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Viveros-Vigoya |first1=Mara |title=The political vitality and vital politics of Césaire's Discourse on Colonialism: A reading in light of contemporary racism |journal=The Sociological Review |date=2019 |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=476–491 |doi=10.1177/0038026119868654 |s2cid=203083086 |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0038026119868654 |access-date=6 December 2020}}</ref> Césaire's wishes for post-war Europe centered around decolonization, arguing that decolonization was the way forward for Europe out of "the binarism of capitalism/communism."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Viveros-Vigoya |first1=Mara |title=The political vitality and vital politics of Césaire's Discourse on Colonialism: A reading in light of contemporary racism |journal=The Sociological Review |date=2019 |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=476–491 |doi=10.1177/0038026119868654 |s2cid=203083086 |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0038026119868654 |access-date=6 December 2020}}</ref> Césaire believed that the only possible redemption for Europe’s dark path which had led to Nazism was through interactions with the "Third World". Decolonization offered an alternative to the dual negatives of capitalism and communism, employing pluralism as a way to usher in a new, more tolerant Europe. He was critical of neo-imperialism and US capitalism, and in many ways his fearful vision of the future has come to fruition today.{{POV-inline|date=September 2021}} Critiques of French universalism were also apparent in the text, particularly citing the issues that universalism caused for the departmentalization of Martinique of which Césaire was the main propagator. Departmentalization was an important goal for Césaire both in his texts and in his political career.{{Cn|date=September 2021}}

Césaire originally wrote his text in French in 1950, but later worked with Joan Pinkham to translate it to English. The translated version was published in 1972.{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}}
