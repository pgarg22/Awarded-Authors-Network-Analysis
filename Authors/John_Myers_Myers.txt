==Life==

Myers was born in [[Northport, Long Island]] on January 11, 1906, to John Caldwell Myers and Alice O'Neil McCorry Myers.<ref name=about/> He was named for his grandfather John Myers, "the extra Myers, sparing me a dynastic 'II' as per race horses, cars, and yachts."<ref name=about/> Myers grew up in various places in New York, including New Paltz and NYC. He has stated that he knew from the time he was seven years old that he wanted to be a writer. He attended Bard St. Stephens College and then Middlebury College, but was expelled from the latter for writing unflattering verse about the faculty. He later attended the [[University of New Mexico]] to study anthropology, but never completed a degree. After extensive travel through Europe and the United States, Myers worked for the ''[[New York World]]'' and ''San Antonio Evening News''. He was also an advertising copywriter. Myers served five years in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]<!--Armored Force--> during [[World War II]]. He and Charlotte Shanahan met while he was stationed at [[Fort Knox]] and they were married in 1943.<ref name=about/> They had two daughters, Anne Caldwell Myers and Celia Myers. In 1948, he moved to [[Tempe, Arizona]] to do research for ''The Last Chance'', and stayed there as he was by that time enamored of the West. While there he worked as editorial writer for the local newspaper.

As of 1984, J.M. and C.S. Myers lived "in the chaparal cock country north and east of [[Mesa, Arizona]], within visiting range of our two daughters". At [[Arizona State University]] he had taught writing, conducted a writers conference, and assembled Western Americana for ASU Libraries.<ref name=about/>

Myers died October 30, 1988.

==Literary career==
Myers published seventeen books, ranging from [[fantasy]] and [[historical fiction]] of the [[American Old West]] to [[epic poetry]] and histories of the West. His first book, ''The Harp and the Blade'' (1941), was a historical novel set in tenth-century France. Myers' best-known work is the literary fantasy novel ''[[Silverlock]]'', published in 1949, which was reprinted in 1966 by [[Ace Books]], with forewords and accolades from [[Poul Anderson]], [[Larry Niven]] and [[Jerry Pournelle]].<ref>''Silverlock'', John Myers Myers. Ace Books, 1966 (fifth printing), {{ISBN|0-441-76672-2}}</ref> The novel's settings and characters, other than the protagonist, are drawn entirely from numerous other works of literature, such as the ''[[Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Don Quixote]]''. His last book, ''The Moon's Fire-Eating Daughter'' (1981), was advertised as a sequel to ''Silverlock''. Myers' non-fiction works included a history of the Alamo, the first biography of [[Doc Holliday]], a study of the [[San Francisco Committee of Vigilance|vigilante movement in San Francisco]], and a well-researched biography of [[Hugh Glass]], an early American fur trapper and frontiersman.
