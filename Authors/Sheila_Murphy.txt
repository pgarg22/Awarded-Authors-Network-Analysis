She is the recipient of the Gertrude Stein Award for her book ''Letters to Unfinished J''. Green Integer Press. 2003. Murphy was awarded the Hay(na)ku Poetry Book Prize from Meritage Press (U.S.A.) and xPress(ed) (Finland) in 2017 for her book ''Reporting Live from You Know Where''. 2018. She currently lives in [[Phoenix, Arizona]].

She earned:

* M.A. degree (English Language and Literature, Michigan College Fellow) from The [[University of Michigan]]

Murphy co-founded and coordinated the [[Scottsdale Center for the Arts]] Poetry Series for twelve years.

Since 1986, the prose poem has been the form of choice for Murphy, who coined the term for a new kind of prose poem, the "American [[Haibun]]",<ref>[http://www.unf.edu/mudlark/mudlark08/murphy.html unf.edu]</ref> which is quite separate from the traditional [[Japanese poetry|Japanese]] form.
