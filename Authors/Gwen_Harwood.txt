'''Gwen Harwood''' [[Officer of the Order of Australia|AO]] (8 June 1920{{spaced ndash}}4 December 1995), née '''Gwendoline Nessie Foster''', was an Australian poet and [[libretto|librettist]]. Gwen Harwood is regarded as one of Australia's finest poets, publishing over 420 works, including 386 poems and 13 librettos.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Keane|first=Colleen|date=2013-02-11|title=Gwen Harwood, Selected Poems|url=https://www.smh.com.au/education/gwen-harwood-selected-poems-20130211-2e7lg.html|access-date=2021-05-20|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en}}</ref> She won numerous poetry awards and prizes, and one of Australia's most significant poetry prizes, the [[Gwen Harwood Poetry Prize]] is named for her.  Her work is commonly studied in schools and university courses.

Gwen Harwood was the mother of the author [[John Harwood (writer)|John Harwood]].

==Life==
Harwood was born on 8 June 1920 in [[Taringa, Queensland|Taringa]], a suburb of [[Brisbane]]. She attended [[Brisbane Girls' Grammar School]] and was an organist at All Saints' Church when she was young. She completed a music teacher's diploma, and also worked as a typist at the War Damage Commission from 1942. Early in her life, she developed an interest in literature, philosophy and music.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hoddinott|first=Alison|title=Harwood, Gwendoline Nessie (Gwen) (1920–1995)|url=https://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/harwood-gwendoline-nessie-gwen-22407|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|place=Canberra|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|access-date=2021-05-17}}</ref>

She married linguist Bill Harwood in September 1945, shortly after which they moved to Oyster Cove south of [[Hobart]] as he was appointed a lecturer at the [[University of Tasmania]]. Here she developed her lifelong interest in the work of philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] "which informs her entire opus".<ref name="Wilde 1994 p. 349">Wilde, Hooton and Andrews (1994) p. 349</ref>

Her father played piano, violin, guitar and the flute. Both Gwen and her brother were given piano lessons, and originally Gwen wanted to be a musician. Gwen's grandmother introduced her to poetry; this inspired her and became her lifelong calling and passion.

==Literary career==
Gwen Harwood had written poetry for many years, and her first poem was published in ''[[Meanjin]]'' in 1944, but her work did not start appearing regularly in journals and books until the 1960s.<ref name="Wilde 1994 p. 349"/> Her first book of poems, titled ''Poems'', was published in 1963, followed in 1968 by ''Poems Volume II''. Other books include ''The Lion's Bride'' (1981), ''Bone Scan'' (1988), and ''The Present Tense'' (1995). There are also several versions of a ''Selected Poems'', including one from [[Penguin Books|Penguin]] in 2001.

Harwood used a range of pseudonyms in her early work, such as ''Walter Lehmann'', ''W.W. Hagendoor'' (an [[anagram]] of her name), ''Francis Geyer'', ''Timothy (TF) Kline'', ''Miriam Stone'', and ''Alan Carvosso''.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Nelson|first=Camilla|title=Reclaim Her Name: why we should free Australia's female novelists from their male pseudonyms|url=http://theconversation.com/reclaim-her-name-why-we-should-free-australias-female-novelists-from-their-male-pseudonyms-144404|access-date=2021-06-01|website=The Conversation|language=en}}</ref>  Most of her poems submitted for publication under her own name were initially rejected. The editor of ''[[Meanjin]]'', [[Clem Christesen|C. B. Christesen]], once rejected a poem from Harwood but used an expression in it ("the freckled shade") as the title of one of his own poems.  In 1961 ''[[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin]]'' accepted a [[sonnet]] from her alter ego Walter Lehmann, but only after it was published was it brought to the attention of the editor, [[Donald Horne]], that the initial letters of each line formed the phrase "FUCK ALL EDITORS".<ref>{{Citation

She also wrote libretti for composers such as [[Larry Sitsky]], [[James Penberthy]], [[Don Kay (composer)|Don Kay]] and [[Ian Cugley]].<ref name="Wilde 1994 p. 349"/>

She corresponded over the years with several poet friends, including [[Vincent Buckley]], [[A. D. Hope]], [[Vivian Smith (poet)|Vivian Smith]], and [[Norman Talbot (poet)|Norman Talbot]], as well as family and other friends such as Tony Riddell, and two volumes of her letters have been published.

Her poetry has been used by many students who are completing the Higher School Certificate (HSC) in New South Wales, Australia, by Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE) students in Victoria, Australia, by the International Baccalaureate (IB) in Australia, and by Western Australian Certificate of Education (WACE) students in Western Australia, Australia.

==Literary themes and style==
Harwood's poetry has recurring themes of motherhood and the stifled role of women, particularly those of young mothers. Her poem "In the Park" established a certain feminist reputation but others of her poems treat motherhood in a more complex and nuanced way.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=The Best 100 Poems of Gwen Harwood {{!}} Review {{!}}|url=https://sydneyreviewofbooks.com/review/gwen-harwood-poems/|access-date=2021-06-01|website=Sydney Review of Books|language=en}}</ref> Music is another recurring motif. The Tasmanian landscape, and Aboriginal dispossession of that landscape, form another theme in much of her writing.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Harrex|first=Syd|date=1986|title=Island lyrics: Vivian smith, Gwen Harwood, and James McAuley|url=https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/informit.764543371624687|journal=Island Magazine|language=EN|volume=25-26|pages=67–73|via=Informit}}</ref> She also wrote series of poems with recurring characters, two of the most notorious being Professor Eisenbart and Kröte.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=STRAUSS|first=JENNIFER|date=1994|title=Playing in time: the poetry of Gwen Harwood|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41556562|journal=Critical Survey|volume=6|issue=1|pages=81–87|jstor=41556562|issn=0011-1570}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Edgar|first=Stephen|date=1986|title=An interview with Gwen Harwood|url=https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/informit.764580637567204|journal=Island Magazine|language=EN|volume=25-26|pages=74–76|via=Informit}}</ref> Many of her poems also include biblical references and religious allusions.<ref>{{Citation|last=Evans|first=Raymond|title=Disparate Visions: The Contested Homefront Worlds of Gwen Harwood, Faith Richmond and Judith Wright (1939–1945)|date=2017|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-50400-1_8|work=Claiming Space for Australian Women’s Writing|pages=141–161|editor-last=Das|editor-first=Devaleena|place=Cham|publisher=Springer International Publishing|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-50400-1_8|isbn=978-3-319-50400-1|access-date=2021-06-01|editor2-last=Dasgupta|editor2-first=Sanjukta}}</ref>
