It was produced in association with Market Road Films, the Labyrinth Theater Company and Project&.

''This Is Reading'' was conceived by Nottage, and co-created by an award-winning team of artists, including filmmaker [[Tony Gerber]], director Kate Whoriskey and Choreographer Rennie Harris.

====Film and television====
Nottage was a producer and writer for the first season of ''[[She's Gotta Have It (TV series)|She's Gotta Have It]]''.

==Themes==
''The Guardian'' noted: "Nottage's two decades of work has garnered praise for bringing challenging and often forgotten, stories onto the stage. ... ''Ruined'' explored the use of rape as a weapon against women in the Democratic Republic of Congo, while ''Intimate Apparel'' focused on a lonely black seamstress working in New York in 1905... Future areas the 51-year-old is keen to explore in her plays includes the American prison industrial complex, which is "destroying the lives of so many men of colour" but is barely talked about in the national conversation or on the stage. Yet Nottage also expressed disappointment that her work was constantly defined by both her own race and gender, unlike her white male counterparts."<ref>Ellis-Petersen, Hannah, [https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/feb/22/playwright-lynn-nottage-theatre-is-the-last-bastion-of-segregation "Playwright Lynn Nottage: theatre is the last bastion of segregation"], ''The Guardian'', February 22, 2016.</ref>
