'''Aleksander Głowacki''' (20 August 1847&nbsp;– 19 May 1912), better known by his [[pen name]] '''Bolesław Prus''' ({{IPA-pl|bɔˈlεswaf ˈprus|lang|Pl-Bolesław_Prus.ogg}}), was a Polish novelist, a leading figure in the history of [[Polish literature]] and [[History of philosophy in Poland#Positivism|philosophy]], as well as a distinctive voice in [[world literature]].<ref name="literature"/><ref name="undoubtedly"/>

As a 15-year-old, Aleksander Głowacki joined the Polish [[January Uprising|1863 Uprising]] against [[Imperial Russia]]. Shortly after his 16th birthday, he suffered severe battle injuries.  Five months later, he was imprisoned for his part in the Uprising.  These early experiences may have precipitated the [[panic disorder]] and [[agoraphobia]] that dogged him through life, and shaped his opposition to attempting to regain Poland's independence by force of arms.

In 1872, at the age of 25, in [[Warsaw]], he settled into a 40-year journalistic career that highlighted science, technology, education, and economic and cultural development.  These societal enterprises were essential to the endurance of a people who had in the 18th century been [[Partitions of Poland|partitioned out of political existence]] by Russia, Prussia and Austria. Głowacki took his [[pen name]] "''Prus''" from the appellation of his family's [[Prus coat of arms|coat-of-arms]].

As a sideline, he wrote [[short stories]].  Succeeding with these, he went on to employ a larger canvas; over the decade between 1884 and 1895, he completed four major [[novel]]s: ''[[The Outpost (Prus novel)|The Outpost]]'', ''[[The Doll (novel)|The Doll]]'', ''[[The New Woman]]'' and ''[[Pharaoh (Prus novel)|Pharaoh]]''.  ''The Doll'' depicts the romantic infatuation of a man of action who is frustrated by his country's backwardness.  ''Pharaoh'', Prus's only [[historical novel]], is a study of [[political power]] and of the fates of nations, set in [[ancient Egypt]] at the fall of the [[20th Dynasty]] and [[New Kingdom]].

[[File:Lublin Castle 5 Lublin 28.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Lublin Castle]], Prus's prison during [[January Uprising|1863–65 Uprising]]]]
Aleksander Głowacki was born 20 August 1847 in [[Hrubieszów]], now in southeastern Poland, very near the present-day border with [[Ukraine]].  The town was then in the Russian-controlled sector of partitioned Poland, known as the "[[Congress Poland|Congress Kingdom]]".  Aleksander was the younger son of Antoni Głowacki, an estate steward at the village of [[Żabcze]], in [[Hrubieszów County]], and Apolonia Głowacka ([[Given name#Name at birth|née]] Trembińska).<ref>Krystyna Tokarzówna, Stanisław Fita, ''Bolesław Prus, 1847–1912: Kalendarz życia i twórczości'' (Bolesław Prus, 1847–1912: a Calendar of His Life and Work), ed. Zygmunt Szweykowski, Warsaw, Państwowy Instytut Wydawniczy, 1969, p. 12.</ref>

In 1850, when the future ''Bolesław Prus'' was three years old, his mother died; the child was placed in the care of his maternal grandmother, Marcjanna Trembińska of [[Puławy]], and, four years later, in the care of his aunt, Domicela Olszewska of [[Lublin]]. In 1856 Prus was [[orphan]]ed by his father's death and, aged 9, began attending a Lublin primary school whose principal, Józef Skłodowski, grandfather of the future double [[Nobel laureate]] [[Maria Skłodowska-Curie]],<ref name="robert"/> administered canings (a customary mode of disciplining) to wayward pupils, including the spirited Aleksander.<ref>[[:pl:Monika Piątkowska|Monika Piątkowska]], ''Prus:  Śledztwo biograficzne'' (Prus:  A Biographical Investigation), [[Kraków]], [[Wydawnictwo Znak]], 2017, {{ISBN|978-83-240-4543-3}}, pp. 49–50.</ref>

In 1862, Prus's brother, Leon, a teacher thirteen years his senior, took him to [[Siedlce]], then to [[Kielce]].<ref name="Bolesław Prus"/>

Soon after the outbreak of the Polish [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprising]] against [[Imperial Russia]], 15-year-old Prus ran away from school to join the insurgents.<ref name="Pieścikowski, Edward p. 147">Pieścikowski, Edward, ''Bolesław Prus'', p. 147.</ref>  He may have been influenced by his brother Leon, one of the Uprising's leaders. Leon, during a June 1863 mission to Wilno (now [[Vilnius]]) in [[Lithuania]] for the Polish insurgent government, developed a debilitating mental illness that would end only with his death in 1907.<ref>Pieścikowski, Edward, ''Bolesław Prus'', p. 165.</ref>

On 1 September 1863, twelve days after his sixteenth birthday, Prus took part in a battle against Russian forces at a village called Białka, four kilometers south of [[Siedlce]]. He suffered [[contusion]]s to the neck and [[gunpowder]] injuries to his eyes, and was captured unconscious on the battlefield and taken to hospital in Siedlce.<ref name="tokarzówna"/> This experience may have caused his subsequent lifelong [[agoraphobia]].<ref name="Wspomnienia o Bolesławie Prusie (Reminiscences about Bolesław Prus)"/>
[[File:Bolesław Prus fotografia Konrada Brandla 1871.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Prus: [[Warsaw University]] student]] 
Five months later, in early February 1864, Prus was arrested and imprisoned at [[Lublin Castle]] for his role in the Uprising. In early April a military court sentenced him to forfeiture of his nobleman's status and resettlement on imperial lands.  On 30 April, however, the Lublin District military head credited Prus's time spent under arrest and, on account of the 16-year-old's youth, decided to place him in the custody of his uncle Klemens Olszewski.  On 7 May, Prus was released and entered the household of Katarzyna Trembińska, a relative and the mother of his future wife, Oktawia Trembińska.<ref name="krystyna"/>

Prus enrolled at a [[Lublin]] ''[[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]'' ([[secondary school]]), the still functioning prestigious [[:pl:I Liceum Ogólnokształcące im. Stanisława Staszica w Lublinie|Stanisław Staszic School]], founded in 1586. Graduating on 30 June 1866, at nineteen he matriculated in the [[University of Warsaw|Warsaw University]] Department of Mathematics and Physics.<ref name="Prus, 147"/>  In 1868, poverty forced him to break off his university studies.<ref name="Pieścikowski, Edward p. 147"/>

In 1869, he enrolled in the Forestry Department at the newly opened Agriculture and Forestry Institute in [[Puławy]], a historic town where he had spent some of his childhood and which, 15 years later, was the setting for his striking 1884 [[flash fiction|micro-story]], "[[Mold of the Earth]]", comparing [[human history]] with the mutual aggressions of blind, mindless colonies of molds that cover a boulder adjacent to the [[Temple of the Sibyl]]. In January 1870, after only three months at the Institute, Prus was expelled for his insufficient deference toward the martinet Russian-language instructor.<ref name="Prus, 147"/>

Henceforth he studied on his own while supporting himself mainly as a tutor.  As part of his program of self-education, he translated and summarized [[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''[[A System of Logic]]''.

In 1872, he embarked on a career as a newspaper [[columnist]], while working several months at the [[Evans, Lilpop and Rau]] Machine and Agricultural Implement Works in Warsaw.<ref name="cikowski"/> In 1873, Prus delivered two public lectures which illustrate the breadth of his scientific interests: "On the Structure of the Universe", and "[[Logology (science)#Discoveries and inventions|On Discoveries and Inventions]]."<ref name="cikowski1"/>

=== Columnist ===
[[File:Boleslaw Prus.jpg|thumb|Prus]]
As a newspaper [[columnist]], Prus commented on the achievements of scholars and scientists such as [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Charles Darwin]], [[Alexander Bain (philosopher)|Alexander Bain]], [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Henry Thomas Buckle]];<ref name="szweykowski"/> urged Poles to study science and technology and to develop industry and commerce;<ref name="ReferenceA">Krystyna Tokarzówna and Stanisław Fita, ''Bolesław Prus, 1847–1912: Kalendarz życia i twórczości'' (Bolesław Prus, 1847–1912: A Calendar of His Life and Work), ''passim.''</ref> encouraged the establishment of [[charitable organization|charitable institutions]] to benefit the underprivileged;<ref name="ReferenceA"/> described the fiction and nonfiction works of fellow writers such as [[H.G.

His "Weekly Chronicles" spanned forty years (they have since been reprinted in twenty volumes) and helped prepare the ground for the 20th-century blossoming of Polish [[Timeline of Polish science and technology|science]] and especially [[Polish School of Mathematics|mathematics]].{{efn|Prus was not alone in advocating the development of science and technology.  It was part of the spirit of the times.  The great Polish mathematician [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]] writes that in the period when Poland was under complete foreign rule (1795–1918) "It was a common belief that the cultivation of science and the growth of its potential would somehow guarantee the [survival] of the [Polish] nation."<ref name="A Half Century of Polish Mathematics:  Remembrances and Reflections"/>}} "Our national life," wrote Prus, "will take a normal course only when we have become a useful, indispensable element of civilization, when we have become able to give nothing for free and to demand nothing for free."<ref name="Bolesław Prus2"/> The social importance of science and technology recurred as a theme in his novels ''[[The Doll (novel)|The Doll]]'' (1889)<ref>[[Zygmunt Szweykowski]], ''Twórczość Bolesława Prusa'' (The Creative Writing of Bolesław Prus), pp. 170–71.</ref> and ''[[Pharaoh (Prus novel)|Pharaoh]]'' (1895).<ref>[[Christopher Kasparek]], "Prus' ''Pharaoh'': Primer on Power", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. XL, no. 3, 1995, p. 332.</ref>

Of contemporary thinkers, the one who most influenced Prus and other writers of the Polish "[[Positivism in Poland|Positivist]]" period (roughly 1864–1900) was [[Herbert Spencer]], the English [[sociologist]] who coined the phrase, "[[survival of the fittest]]." Prus called Spencer "the [[Aristotle]] of the 19th century" and wrote: "I grew up under the influence of Spencerian [[evolution]]ary [[philosophy]] and heeded its counsels, not those of [[Idealist]] or [[Auguste Comte|Comtean]] [[philosophy]]."<ref>[[Zygmunt Szweykowski]], ''Twórczość Bolesława Prusa'' (The Art of Bolesław Prus), p. 22.</ref> Prus interpreted "survival of the fittest," in the societal sphere, as involving not only competition but also cooperation; and he adopted Spencer's metaphor of [[Herbert Spencer#General influence|society as organism]].<ref>[[Zygmunt Szweykowski]], ''Twórczość Bolesława Prusa'' (The Art of Bolesław Prus), pp. 32–33.</ref>  He used this metaphor to striking effect in his 1884 [[flash fiction|micro-story]] "[[Mold of the Earth]]," and in the introduction to his 1895 [[historical novel]], ''[[Pharaoh (Prus novel)#Themes|Pharaoh]]''.<ref>[[Christopher Kasparek]], "Prus' ''Pharaoh'': the Creation of a Historical Novel", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', 1994, no. 1, p. 49.</ref>

After Prus began writing regular weekly newspaper columns, his finances stabilized, permitting him on 14 January 1875 to marry a [[List of coupled cousins|distant cousin]] on his mother's side, Oktawia Trembińska.  She was the daughter of Katarzyna Trembińska, in whose home he had lived, after release from prison, for two years from 1864 to 1866 while completing secondary school.<ref name="wspomnienia"/> The couple adopted a boy, Emil Trembiński (born 11 September 1886, the son of Prus's brother-in-law Michał Trembiński, who had died on 10 November 1888).<ref name="kalendarz"/>  Emil was the model for Rascal in chapter 48 of Prus's 1895 novel, ''[[Pharaoh (Prus novel)|Pharaoh]]''.<ref name="tokarzówna5"/> On 18 February 1904, aged seventeen, Emil fatally shot himself in the chest on the doorstep of an unrequited love.<ref name="tokarzówna6"/><ref name="stepdaughter"/>

It has been alleged that in 1906, aged 59, Prus had a son, Jan Bogusz Sacewicz.  The boy's mother was Alina Sacewicz, widow of Dr. Kazimierz Sacewicz, a socially conscious physician whom Prus had known at Nałęczów.  Dr. Sacewicz may have been the model for [[Stefan Żeromski]]'s Dr. Judym in the novel, ''Ludzie bezdomni'' (Homeless People)—a character resembling Dr. Stockman in [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s play, ''[[An Enemy of the People]]''.<ref name="futurological"/>  Prus, known for his affection for children, took a lively interest in little Jan, as attested by a prolific correspondence with Jan's mother (whom Prus attempted to interest in writing). Jan Sacewicz became one of Prus's major [[legatee]]s and an engineer, and died in a German camp after the suppression of the [[Warsaw Uprising]] of August–October 1944.<ref name="pauszer"/>
[[File:Herb Prus.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Prus coat of arms|Coat-of-arms]] that inspired the [[pen-name]] "Bolesław '''''Prus'''''"]]
Though Prus was a gifted writer, initially best known as a humorist, he early on thought little of his journalistic and literary work. Hence at the inception of his career in 1872, at the age of 25, he adopted for his newspaper columns and fiction the [[pen name]] "Prus" ("''[[Prus Coat of Arms|Prus I]]''" was his family [[coat-of-arms]]), reserving his actual name, Aleksander Głowacki, for "serious" writing.<ref name="Bolesław Prus7"/>

An 1878 incident illustrates the strong feelings that can be aroused in susceptible readers of newspaper columns. Prus had criticized the rowdy behavior of some Warsaw university students at a lecture about the poet [[Wincenty Pol]]. The students demanded that Prus retract what he had written.  He refused, and, on 26 March 1878, several of them surrounded him outside his home, where he had returned shortly before in the company (for his safety) of two fellow writers; one of the students, Jan Sawicki, slapped Prus's face.<ref name="tokarzówna8"/> Police were summoned, but Prus declined to press charges.<ref name="lorentowicz"/>  Seventeen years later, during his 1895 visit to [[Paris]], Prus's memory of the incident was still so painful that he may have refused (accounts vary) to meet with one of his assailants, [[Kazimierz Dłuski]], and his wife [[Bronisława Dłuska]] ([[Marie Skłodowska Curie]]'s sister who 19 years later, in 1914, scolded [[Joseph Conrad]] for writing his novels and stories in English, rather than in [[Polish language|Polish]] for the benefit of Polish culture<ref>[[Zdzisław Najder]], ''[[Joseph Conrad]]:  A Life'', 2007, p. 463.</ref>).<ref name="tokarzówna9"/>  These curiously interlinked incidents involving the Dłuskis and the two authors perhaps illustrate the contemporary intensity of aggrieved Polish national pride.

In 1882, on the recommendation of an earlier editor-in-chief, the prophet of [[Positivism in Poland|Polish Positivism]], [[Aleksander Świętochowski]], Prus succeeded to the editorship of the [[Warsaw]] daily ''Nowiny'' (News). The newspaper had been bought in June 1882 by financier [[Stanisław Kronenberg]].  Prus resolved, in the best [[Positivism in Poland|Positivist]] fashion, to make it "an observatory of societal facts"—an instrument for advancing the development of his country. After less than a year, however, ''Nowiny''—which had had a history of financial instability since changing in July 1878 from a Sunday paper to a daily—folded, and Prus resumed writing [[column (newspaper)|columns]].<ref name="kalendarz10"/><ref name="cikowski11">Pieścikowski, Edward, ''Bolesław Prus'', 152.</ref>  He continued working as a journalist to the end of his life, well after he had achieved success as an author of short stories and novels.<ref>Pieścikowski, Edward, ''Bolesław Prus'', p. 166.</ref>

In an 1884 newspaper column, published two decades before the Wright brothers flew, Prus anticipated that powered flight would not bring humanity closer to universal comity:  "Are there among flying creatures only doves, and no hawks?  Will tomorrow’s flying machine obey only the honest and the wise, and not fools and knaves?...  The expected societal changes may come down to a new form of chase and combat in which the man who is vanquished on high will fall and smash the skull of the peaceable man down below."<ref>Cited in [[Zygmunt Szweykowski]], ''Twórczość Bolesława Prusa'' (The Creative Writing of Bolesław Prus), 2nd ed., Warsaw, Państwowy Instytut Wydawniczy, 1972, p. 171.</ref>

In a January 1909 column, Prus discussed [[H.G. Wells]]'s 1901 book, ''[[Anticipations]]'', including Wells's prediction that by the year 2000, following the defeat of German [[imperialism]] "on land and at sea," there would be a [[European Union]] that would reach eastward to include the [[western Slavs]]—the [[Poland|Poles]], [[Czech Republic|Czechs]] and [[Slovakia|Slovaks]]. The latter peoples, along with the [[Hungary|Hungarians]] and six other countries, did in fact join the [[European Union]] in 2004.<ref name="A Futurological Note: Prus on H.G. Wells and the Year 2000"/>

=== Fiction ===
[[File:Prus na frontopisie pierwszego wydania Lalki.jpg|thumb|125px|Prus, by [[Józef Holewiński|Holewiński]]. [[Book frontispiece|Frontispiece]] to first book edition of  ''[[The Doll (novel)|The Doll]]'', 1890.]]

In time, Prus adopted the French Positivist critic [[Hippolyte Taine]]'s concept of the arts, including literature, as a second means, alongside the sciences, of studying reality,<ref name="szweykowski12"/><ref name="phenomenon"/> and he devoted more attention to his sideline of [[short story|short-story writer]]. Prus's stories, which met with great acclaim, owed much to the literary influence of Polish novelist [[Józef Ignacy Kraszewski]] and, among English-language writers, to [[Charles Dickens]] and [[Mark Twain]].<ref name="The History of Polish Literature"/> His fiction was also influenced by French writers [[Victor Hugo]], [[Gustave Flaubert]], [[Alphonse Daudet]] and [[Émile Zola]].<ref name="szweykowski13"/>

Prus wrote several dozen stories, originally published in newspapers and ranging in length from [[flash fiction|micro-story]] to [[novella]].  Characteristic of them are Prus's keen observation of everyday life and sense of humor, which he had early honed as a contributor to humor magazines.<ref name="szweykowski14"/> The prevalence of themes from everyday life is consistent with the Polish Positivist artistic program, which sought to portray the circumstances of the [[populace]] rather than those of the [[Romantic hero]]es of an earlier generation.  The literary period in which Prus wrote was ostensibly a [[prose|prosaic]] one, by contrast with the [[poetry]] of the Romantics; but Prus's prose is often a [[prose poetry|poetic prose]].  His stories also often contain elements of [[fantasy]] or whimsy.  A fair number originally appeared in [[New Year]]'s issues of newspapers.<ref>Tokarzówna, Krystyna; Stanisław Fita, ''Bolesław Prus, 1847–1912: Kalendarz życia i twórczości'', ''passim''.</ref>

Prus long eschewed writing [[historical fiction]], arguing that it must inevitably distort [[history]].  He criticized contemporary [[historical novel]]ists for their lapses in historical accuracy, including [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]]'s failure, in the military scenes in his ''[[The Trilogy|Trilogy]]'' portraying 17th-century Polish history, to describe the [[logistics]] of warfare.  It was only in 1888, when Prus was forty, that he wrote his first historical fiction, the stunning short story, "[[A Legend of Old Egypt]]."  This story, a few years later, served as a preliminary sketch for his only historical novel, ''[[Pharaoh (Prus novel)|Pharaoh]]'' (1895).<ref name="wspomnienia15"/><ref>Szweykowski, Zygmunt, ''"Geneza noweli 'Z legend dawnego Egiptu'"'' (The Genesis of the Short Story, "A Legend of Old Egypt"), in ''Nie tylko o Prusie: szkice'' (Not Only about Prus: Sketches), 1st ed., 1967, pp. 256–61.</ref>

Eventually Prus composed four [[novel]]s on what he had referred to in an 1884 letter as "great questions of our age":<ref name="cikowski16"/> ''[[The Outpost (Prus novel)|The Outpost]]'' (''Placówka'', 1886) on the Polish peasant; ''[[The Doll (novel)|The Doll]]'' (''Lalka'', 1889) on the [[aristocracy]] and [[townspeople]] and on [[Ideal (ethics)|idealists]] struggling to bring about [[social reform]]s; ''[[The New Woman (novel)|The New Woman]]'' (''Emancypantki'', 1893) on [[feminism|feminist]] concerns; and his only [[historical novel]], ''[[Pharaoh (Prus novel)|Pharaoh]]'' (''Faraon'', 1895), on mechanisms of [[political power]].  The work of greatest sweep and most universal appeal is ''Pharaoh''.<ref name="christopher"/>  Prus's novels, like his stories, were originally published in newspaper [[serial (literature)|serialization]].<ref>Szweykowski, Zygmunt, ''Twórczość Bolesława Prusa'', ''passim''.</ref>

After having sold ''Pharaoh'' to the publishing firm of Gebethner and Wolff, Prus embarked, on 16 May 1895, on a four-month journey abroad. He visited [[Berlin]], [[Dresden]], [[Karlovy Vary|Karlsbad]], [[Nuremberg]], [[Stuttgart]] and [[Rapperswil]]. At the latter Swiss town he stayed two months (July–August), nursing his [[agoraphobia]] and spending much time with his friends, the promising young writer [[Stefan Żeromski]] and his wife Oktawia. The couple sought Prus's help for the [[Polish Museum, Rapperswil#Żeromski and Prus|Polish National Museum]], housed in the Rapperswil Castle, where Żeromski was librarian.<ref name="Pieścikowski 157"/>

The final stage of Prus's journey took him to [[Paris]], where he was prevented by his agoraphobia from crossing the [[Seine River]] to visit the city's southern [[Rive Gauche|Left Bank]].<ref name="Pieścikowski 157"/> He was nevertheless pleased to find that his descriptions of Paris in ''The Doll'' had been on the mark (he had based them mainly on French-language publications).<ref name="wspomnienia17"/> From Paris, he hurried home to recuperate at [[Nałęczów]] from his journey, the last that he made abroad.<ref name="Bolesław Prus18"/>

=== Later years ===
[[File:Bolesław Prus (1897).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Portrait by [[Antoni Kamieński]], 1897, celebrating Prus's 25 years as journalist and fiction writer]]
Over the years, Prus lent his support to many charitable and social causes, but there was one event he came to rue for the broad criticism it brought him:  his participation in welcoming Russia's [[tsar]] during [[Nicholas II]]'s 1897 visit to Warsaw.<ref name="Bolesław Prus19"/>  As a rule, Prus did not affiliate himself with [[political parties]], as this might compromise his journalistic objectivity.  His associations, by design and temperament, were with individuals and select worthy causes rather than with large groups.<ref>Tokarzówna, Krystyna; Stanisław Fita; Zygmunt Szweykowski, ed.; ''Bolesław Prus, 1847–1912: Kalendarz życia i twórczości'' (Bolesław Prus, 1847–1912: a Calendar of His Life and Work), 1969, ''passim''.</ref>

The disastrous [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprising]] had persuaded Prus that society must advance through learning, work and commerce rather than through risky social upheavals. He departed from this stance, however, in 1905, when [[Imperial Russia]] experienced defeat in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] and Poles demanded autonomy and reforms. On 20 December 1905, in the first issue of a short-lived periodical, ''Młodość'' (Youth), he published an article, "''Oda do młodości''" ("Ode to Youth"), whose title harked back to an 1820 poem by [[Adam Mickiewicz]]. Prus wrote, in reference to his earlier position on revolution and strikes: "with the greatest pleasure, I admit it—I was wrong!"<ref name="tokarzówna20"/>
[[File:Bolesław Prus tomb.PNG|thumb|175px|Prus's tomb at Warsaw's [[Powązki Cemetery]], designed by his nephew, [[Stanisław Jackowski]]]]
In 1908, Prus serialized, in the Warsaw ''Tygodnik Ilustrowany'' (Illustrated Weekly), his novel ''Dzieci'' (Children), depicting the young revolutionaries, terrorists and anarchists of the day — an uncharacteristically humorless work. Three years later a final novel, ''Przemiany'' (Changes), was to have been, like ''[[The Doll (novel)|The Doll]]'', a panorama of society and its vital concerns. However, in 1911 and 1912, the novel had barely begun serialization in the ''Illustrated Weekly'' when its composition was cut short by Prus's death.<ref name="Bolesław Prus21"/>

Neither of the two late novels, ''Children'' or ''Changes'', is generally regarded as part of the essential Prus canon, and [[Czesław Miłosz]] has called ''Children'' one of Prus's weakest works.<ref name="The History of Polish Literature22"/>

Prus's last novel to meet with popular acclaim was ''[[Pharaoh (Prus novel)|Pharaoh]]'', completed in 1895.  Depicting the demise of [[ancient Egypt]]'s [[Twentieth Dynasty]] and [[New Kingdom]] three thousand years earlier, ''Pharaoh'' had also reflected Poland's loss of independence a century before in 1795<ref name="christopher23"/>—an independence whose post-[[World War I]] restoration Prus did not live to see.

On 19 May 1912, in his Warsaw apartment at 12 Wolf Street (''ulica Wilcza 12''), near [[Triple Cross Square]], his forty-year journalistic and literary career came to an end when the 64-year-old author died.<ref name="cikowski24"/>

The beloved [[agoraphobia|agoraphobic]] writer was mourned by the nation that he had striven, as soldier, thinker, and writer, to rescue from oblivion.<ref name="To samo ramię"/> Thousands attended his 22 May 1912 funeral service at [[St. Alexander's Church, Warsaw|St. Alexander's Church]] on nearby [[Triple Cross Square]] (''Plac Trzech Krzyży'') and his interment at [[Powązki Cemetery]].<ref name="reminiscences"/>

Prus's tomb was designed by his nephew, the noted sculptor [[Stanisław Jackowski]]. On three sides it bears, respectively, the novelist's name, ''Aleksander Głowacki'', his years of birth and death, and his [[pen name]], ''Bolesław Prus''.

[[File:Kazimierz Palace, Warsaw University 4.JPG|thumb|180px|1982 plaque on [[Warsaw University]]'s [[Kazimierz Palace]], commemorating 1866–68 student Bolesław Prus]]
On 3 December 1961, nearly half a century after Prus's death, a museum devoted to him was opened in the 18th-century Małachowski Palace at [[Nałęczów]], near [[Lublin]] in eastern Poland. Outside the palace is a sculpture of Prus seated on a bench.  Another statuary monument to Prus at Nałęczów, sculpted by Alina Ślesińska, was unveiled on 8 May 1966.<ref name="krystyna37"/>  It was at Nałęczów that Prus vacationed for thirty years from 1882 until his death, and that he met the young [[Stefan Żeromski]]. Prus stood witness at Żeromski's 1892 wedding and generously helped foster the younger man's literary career.<ref>Pieścikowski, Edward, ''Bolesław Prus'', pp. 152, 156.</ref>

While Prus espoused a [[positivist]] and [[Literary realism|realist]] outlook, much in his fiction shows qualities compatible with pre-[[January Uprising|1863-Uprising]] Polish [[Romantic literature]].  Indeed, he held the Polish [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poet [[Adam Mickiewicz]] in high regard.<ref name="szweykowski27"/> Prus's novels in turn, especially ''[[The Doll (novel)|The Doll]]'' and ''[[Pharaoh (Prus novel)|Pharaoh]]'', with their innovative composition techniques, blazed the way for the 20th-century Polish novel.<ref name="Bolesław Prus28"/>

Prus's novel ''[[The Doll (novel)|The Doll]]'', with its rich realistic detail and simple, functional language, was considered by [[Czesław Miłosz]] to be the great Polish novel.<ref name="The History of Polish Literature29"/>

[[Joseph Conrad]], during his 1914 visit to Poland just as [[World War I]] was breaking out, "delighted in his beloved Prus" and read everything by the ten-years-older, recently deceased author that he could get his hands on.<ref name="Conrad under Familial Eyes"/>  He pronounced ''[[The New Woman (novel)|The New Woman]]'' (the first novel by Prus that he read) "better than [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]]"—Dickens being a favorite author of Conrad's.<ref name="Conrad under Familial Eyes30"/> [[Czesław Miłosz|Miłosz]], however, thought ''[[The New Woman (novel)|The New Woman]]'' "as a whole... an artistic failure..."<ref name="The History of Polish Literature31"/> [[Zygmunt Szweykowski]] similarly faulted ''The New Woman'''s loose, tangential construction; but this, in his view, was partly redeemed by Prus's humor and by some superb episodes, while "The tragedy of Mrs. Latter and the picture of [the town of] Iksinów are among the peak achievements of [Polish] novel-writing."<ref name="szweykowski32"/>
 
''[[Pharaoh (Prus novel)|Pharaoh]]'', a study of [[political power]], became the favorite novel of Soviet dictator [[Joseph Stalin]], prefigured the fate of U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]], and continues to point analogies to more recent times.<ref name="Prus' ''Pharaoh'' and Curtin's Translation"/>  ''Pharaoh'' is often described as Prus's "best-composed novel"<ref name="redniowiecza"/>—indeed, "one of the best-composed [of all] Polish novels."<ref name="tyszkiewicz"/>  This was due in part to ''Pharaoh'' having been composed complete prior to newspaper serialization, rather than being written in installments just before printing, as was the case with Prus's earlier major novels.<ref>Pieścikowski, Edward, ''Bolesław Prus'', p. 157.</ref>

''The Doll'' and ''Pharaoh'' are available in English versions.<ref name="welsh"/> ''The Doll'' has been translated into twenty-eight languages, and ''Pharaoh'' into twenty. In addition, ''The Doll'' has been filmed several times,<ref>including [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064570/] ''[[The Doll (1968 film)|The Doll]]'', directed by [[Wojciech Jerzy Has]], 1968.</ref> and been produced as a 1977 [[television miniseries]],<ref>''[[:pl:Lalka (serial telewizyjny)|Lalka]]'', directed by [[:pl:Ryszard Ber|Ryszard Ber]], 1977.</ref> ''Pharaoh'' was adapted into a [[Pharaoh (film)|1966 feature film]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060401/] ''[[Pharaoh (film)|Pharaoh]]'' (Internet Movie Database).</ref>

Between 1897 and 1899 Prus [[Serial (literature)|serialized]] in the Warsaw ''Daily Courier'' (''Kurier Codzienny'') a [[monograph]] on ''[[Wikisource:The Most General Life Ideals|The Most General Life Ideals]]'' (''Najogólniejsze ideały życiowe''), which systematized ethical ideas that he had developed over his career regarding ''happiness'', ''utility'' and ''perfection'' in the lives of individuals and societies.<ref>[[Zygmunt Szweykowski]], ''Twórczość Bolesława Prusa'' (The Art of Bolesław Prus), pp. 295–97 and ''[[passim]]''.</ref> In it he returned to the society-organizing (i.e., political) interests that had been frustrated during his ''Nowiny'' editorship fifteen years earlier. A book edition appeared in 1901 (2nd, revised edition, 1905). This work, rooted in [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s [[Utilitarianism|Utilitarian philosophy]] and [[Herbert Spencer#General influence|Herbert Spencer's]] view of society-as-organism, retains interest especially for [[philosophy|philosophers]] and [[social science|social scientists]].<ref>Pieścikowski, Edward, ''Bolesław Prus'', pp. 138–39, 161, 163–64.</ref>

Another of Prus's learned projects remained incomplete at his death. He had sought, over his writing career, to develop a coherent theory of literary composition.  Notes of his from 1886 to 1912 were never put together into a finished book as he had intended.<ref name="melkowski"/>{{efn|In 1890 Prus wrote: "When I was starting out as a writer, I wrote in part instinctively, in part by inadvertent imitation. My productions were a collection of haphazard observations, put together no doubt against the backdrop of what I had read. Every beginning author does the same. To be sure, this kind of work was to me a great mortification. [...] Then I began asking older authors, and they told me that 'there are no rules, nor can there be any, for the art of novel-writing.' [...] Then [about 1880], brought to desperation, I set about trying to resolve for myself the question: 'Can literary art be reduced to general rules?' After several years of observing and thinking, the matter began to get clearer for me, and as early as August 1886 I set down my first notes [...] and, God willing, I hope to publish a scientific theory of literary art. I expect that it will contain some fairly new things."<ref name="Bolesław Prus41"/>}}  His precepts included the maxim, "[[Noun]]s, nouns and more nouns." Some particularly intriguing fragments describe Prus's [[combinatorial]] [[calculation]]s of the millions of potential "individual types" of human [[character structure|characters]], given a stated number of "individual [[Trait theory|traits]]."<ref name="melkowski34"/>

A curious [[comparative literature|comparative-literature]] aspect has been noted to Prus's career, which paralleled that of his American contemporary, [[Ambrose Bierce]] (1842–1914). Each was born and reared in a rural area and had a "Polish" connection (Bierce, born five years before Prus, was reared in [[Kosciusko County, Indiana]], and attended [[high school]] at the [[county seat]], [[Warsaw, Indiana]]). Each became a [[war]] [[Casualty (person)|casualty]] with [[combat]] [[head trauma]]—Prus in 1863 in the Polish [[January Uprising|1863–65 Uprising]]; Bierce in 1864 in the [[American Civil War]]. Each experienced false starts in other occupations, and at twenty-five became a journalist for the next forty years; failed to sustain a career as editor-in-chief; achieved celebrity as a short-story writer; lost a son in tragic circumstances (Prus, an adopted son; Bierce, both his sons); attained superb humorous effects by portraying human egoism (Prus especially in ''[[Pharaoh (Prus novel)|Pharaoh]]'', Bierce in ''[[The Devil's Dictionary]]''); was dogged from early adulthood by a health problem (Prus, [[agoraphobia]]; Bierce, [[asthma]]); and died within two years of the other (Prus in 1912; Bierce presumably in 1914). Prus, however, unlike Bierce, went on from short stories to write novels.<ref name="kasparek"/>

In Prus's lifetime and since, his contributions to Polish literature and culture have been memorialized without regard to the nature of the political system prevailing at the time.  His 50th birthday, in 1897, was marked by special newspaper issues celebrating his 25 years as a journalist and fiction writer, and a portrait of him was commissioned from artist [[Antoni Kamieński]].<ref name="Bolesław Prus35"/>

The town where Prus was born, [[Hrubieszów]], near the present Polish–[[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] border, is graced by an outdoor sculpture of him.

A 1982 plaque on [[Warsaw University]]'s administration building, the historic [[Kazimierz Palace#Warsaw University|Kazimierz Palace]], commemorates Prus's years at the University in 1866–68.  Across the street (''[[Krakowskie Przedmieście]]'') from the University, in [[Holy Cross Church, Warsaw|Holy Cross Church]], a 1936 plaque by Prus's nephew [[Stanisław Jackowski]], featuring Prus's profile, is dedicated to the memory of the "great writer and teacher of the nation."<ref name="reminiscences36"/>

On the front of Warsaw's present-day ''ulica Wilcza 12'', the site of Prus's last home, is a plaque commemorating the earlier, now-nonexistent building's most famous resident.  A few hundred meters from there, ''ulica Bolesława Prusa'' (Bolesław Prus Street) debouches into the southeast corner of Warsaw's [[Triple Cross Square]].  In this square stands St. Alexander's Church, where Prus's funeral was held.<ref name="Bolesław Prus38"/>

In 1937, plaques were installed at Warsaw's ''[[Krakowskie Przedmieście]]'' ''4'' and ''7'', where the two chief characters of Prus's novel ''[[The Doll (novel)|The Doll]]'', Stanisław Wokulski and Ignacy Rzecki, respectively, were deduced to have resided.<ref name="cikowski39"/>  On the same street, in a park adjacent to the [[Hotel Bristol, Warsaw|Hotel Bristol]], near the site of a newspaper for which Prus wrote, stands a twice-life-size statue of Prus, sculpted in 1977 by [[Anna Kamieńska-Łapińska]];<ref name="Bolesław Prus40"/> it is some 12 feet tall, on a minimal pedestal as befits an author who walked the same ground with his fellow men.

Consonant with Prus's interest in commerce and technology, a Polish Ocean Lines [[cargo ship|freighter]] has been named for him.<ref name="Bolesław Prus-2"/>

For 10 years, from 1975 to 1984, Poles honored Prus's memory with a 10-''[[złoty]]'' coin featuring his profile.  In 2012, to mark the 100th anniversary of his death, the Polish mint produced three coins with individual designs:  in gold, silver, and an aluminum-zinc alloy.<ref>{{cite web |title=Three Polish Coins Honor Boleslaw Prus |url=http://news.coinupdate.com/three-coins-honor-boleslaw-prus-1599/ |publisher=Coin Update News |access-date=21 September 2012}}</ref>

Prus's fiction and nonfiction writings continue relevant in our time.<ref>Witness articles such as [[Aleksander Kaczorowski]], ''"My z Wokulskiego"'' ("We [Descendants] of Wokulski) [protagonist of Prus's novel ''[[The Doll (novel)|The Doll]]'']" in ''Plus Minus'', the ''[[Rzeczpospolita (newspaper)|Rzeczpospolita]]'' (Republic) Weekly [Magazine], no. 33 (1016), Saturday-Sunday, 18–19 August 2012, pp. P8-P9.</ref>
