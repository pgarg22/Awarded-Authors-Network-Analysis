==Life==
Born in [[Budapest]] on 29 November 1948, Szirtes came to England as a refugee in 1956 aged 8. After a few days in an army camp followed by three months in an off-season boarding house on the Kent coast, along with other Hungarian refugees, his family moved to London, where he was brought up and went to school, then studied fine art in London and [[Leeds]].<ref Name="Official"/> Among his teachers at Leeds was the poet [[Martin Bell (poet)|Martin Bell]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/george-szirtes|title=George Szirtes : The Poetry Foundation|access-date=14 April 2014}}</ref>

His poems began appearing in national magazines in 1973, and his first book, ''The Slant Door'', was published in 1979. It won the [[Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize]] the following year.

He has won a variety of prizes for his work, most recently the 2004 [[T. S. Eliot Prize]], for his collection ''[[Reel (poetry collection)|Reel]]'',<ref name=farley>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/05/poetry.tseliotprizeforpoetry2004|first=Paul|last=Farley|date=4 February 2005|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=19 June 2019|title=A world of memory: Paul Farley salutes George Szirtes, a worthy winner of the 2004 TS Eliot prize with Reel}}</ref> and the Bess Hokin Prize in 2008 for poems in ''Poetry'' magazine. His translations from Hungarian poetry, fiction and drama have also won numerous awards. He has received an Honorary Fellowhsip from [[Goldsmiths College, University of London]] and an Honorary Doctorate from the [[University of East Anglia]]. He also won the Poetry and the People Award in [[Guangzhou]], China in 2016. In 2019 he was a contributor to ''A New Divan: A Lyrical Dialogue between East and West'' ([[Gingko Library]]).

Szirtes lives in [[Wymondham]], Norfolk, having retired from teaching at the [[University of East Anglia]] in 2013. He is married to the artist Clarissa Upchurch, with whom he ran The Starwheel Press and who has been responsible for most of his book jacket images.
