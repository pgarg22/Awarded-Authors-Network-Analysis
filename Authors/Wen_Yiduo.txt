'''Wen Yiduo''' (24 November 1899{{snd}}15 July 1946) was a Chinese [[poet]] and scholar known for his nationalistic poetry who was assassinated by the [[Kuomintang]].

{{anchor|Biography|History}}

==Life==
Wen was born '''Wén Jiāhuá''' ({{lang|zh-Hant|聞家驊}}) on 24 November 1899 in what is now [[Xishui County, Hubei|Xishui County]] in [[Hubei Province]]. After receiving a traditional Chinese [[Confucian]] education he went on to continue studying at [[Tsinghua University]].

In 1922, he traveled to the [[United States]] to study [[fine arts]] and [[literature]] at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]. It was during this time that his first collection of poetry, ''Hongzhu'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|紅燭}}, "Red Candle"), was published. In 1925, he traveled back to [[China]] and took a university teaching post. In 1928, his second collection, ''Sishui''  ({{lang|zh|死水}}, "Dead Water"), was published. In the same year he joined the [[Crescent Moon Society]] and wrote essays on poetry. He also began to publish the results of his classical [[Chinese literature]] research.

At the outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], he and many other intellectuals from northeastern China migrated  to [[Kunming]], [[Yunnan]].  There he was able to continue to teach, this time in the wartime [[National Southwestern Associated University]].  Wen stopped writing poetry in 1931 and became increasingly involved in social criticism.{{sfnp|Wang|2010|p=484}} He became politically active in 1944 in support of the [[China Democratic League]]. His outspoken nature led to his [[assassination]] by secret agents of the [[Kuomintang]] after eulogizing his friend [[Li Gongpu]]'s life at Li's funeral in 1946.{{sfnp|Li|1994|p=130}}

There is a monument to Wen at the [[Yunnan Normal University]] campus in [[Kunming]], as well as a large statue.  A small memorial to him, including a wall portrait painted from a famous picture of him smoking his pipe is found in a walkway by his former home (the site is now part of an elementary school) in the [[Green Lake (Kunming)|Green Lake]] area of Kunming. He and his wife, Gao Zhen, are buried at the [[Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery]] in Beijing.

==Poetry==
Wen's poetry is noted for its experimentation with classical Chinese rules and forms.  He modeled his poetry on that of the English poets [[John Keats]], [[Alfred Tennyson]], and [[Robert Browning]], and tried to "recapture the symbolism and ethos of premodern Chinese society".{{sfnp|Wang|2010|pp=483–84}}  The poems in his second collection, ''Dead Water'' (''Sǐshuǐ'' {{lang|zh|死水}}), have "a haunting musicality", and deal with the "heartrendingly heavy" subject of exposing social injustice and corruption.{{sfnp|Wang|2010|p=483}}

==Scholarship==
Wen was credited by [[David Hawkes (sinologist)|David Hawkes]] as the initiator of the cult of [[Qu Yuan]] as "China's first [[Chinese nationalism|patriotic]] poet",{{sfnp|Hawkes|1974|p=[https://books.google.com.tw/books?id=wvrnFgUnn-MC&pg=PA42 42]}} writing that, "although Qu Yuan did not write about the life of the people or voice their sufferings, he may truthfully be said to have acted as the leader of a people's revolution and to have struck a blow to avenge them. Qu Yuan is the only person in the whole of Chinese history who is fully entitled to be called 'the people's poet'."{{sfnp|Wen|1956}}
