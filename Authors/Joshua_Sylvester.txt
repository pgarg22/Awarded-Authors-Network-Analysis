'''Josuah Sylvester''' (1563 &ndash; 28 September 1618) was an [[England|English]] [[poet]].

==Biography==

Sylvester was the son of a [[Kent]]ish clothier.  In his tenth year he was sent to school at [[King Edward VI School, Southampton]], where he gained a knowledge of [[French language|French]].  After about three years at school, he appears to have been put to business, and in 1591 the title-page of his ''Yvry'' states that he was in the service of the [[Company of Merchant Adventurers of London|Merchant Adventurers' Company]].

He was for a short time a land steward, and in 1606 [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales]] gave him a small pension as a kind of court poet.  In 1613 he obtained a position as secretary to the Merchant Adventurers.  He was stationed at [[Middelburg, Zeeland|Middelburg]], in the Low Countries, where he died.

==Works==

He translated into English [[heroic couplet]]s the scriptural epic of [[Guillaume du Bartas]].

His ''Essay of the Second Week'' was published in 1598; and in 1604 ''The Divine Weeks of the World's Birth''.  The ornate style of the original offered no difficulty to Sylvester, who was himself a disciple of the [[Euphuist]]s and added many adornments of his own invention.  The ''Sepmaines'' of Du Bartas appealed most to his English and German co-religionists, and the translation was immensely popular.  It has often been suggested that [[John Milton]] owed something in the conception of ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' to Sylvester's translation.  His popularity ceased with the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], and [[John Dryden]] called his verse "abominable fustian."

His works were reprinted by [[A. B. Grosart]] (1880) in the ''Chertsey Worthies Library''. See also [[Charles Dunster]], ''Considerations on Milton's early Reading'' (1800).
