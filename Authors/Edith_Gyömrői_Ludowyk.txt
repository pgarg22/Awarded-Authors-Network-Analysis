==Early years==
Edit (Gelb) Gyömrői was born in [[Budapest]] to Mark Gelb (who changed his name to Gyömrői  in 1899), a furniture manufacturer, and Ilona Pfeifer.<ref name="theisland">[http://www.island.lk/2008/07/16/midweek7.html A Woman against the current: Edith Ludowyk Gyomori]. [[The Island Online]]</ref> She had a younger brother, Boris, and an older sister (by two years), Márta.<ref name="academia">[https://www.academia.edu/6949000/A_Woman_Against_the_Current._The_Life_Paths_of_Edit_Gy%C3%B6mr%C5%91i_Gelb_R%C3%A9nyi_Gl%C3%BCck_Ujv%C3%A1ri_Ludowyk_ A Woman Against the Current.

At her father's request, she began studying interior design, but later dropped out. In 1914, she married chemical engineer Ervin Renyi - with whom she had a son, Gábor, who would later die in a [[fascist]] [[labour camp]] - then divorced him in 1918. Through her uncle István Hollós,<ref>Edith Gyömröi (1896-1987), Psychoanalytikerinnen. Biografisches Lexikon [https://www.psychoanalytikerinnen.de/hungary_biographies.html#Gyoemroei]</ref><ref>[http://mek.oszk.hu/00300/00355/html Gyömrői Edit (Bp., 1896. szept. 8. – London, 1987. febr. 10.)]</ref> she began to learn about [[psychoanalysis]] and attended the 5th [[International Psychoanalytical Association|International Psychoanalytical Congress]] in [[Budapest]].

==Becoming a communist militant==
From 1918 onwards she participated in gatherings of the [[Sonntagskreis|Sunday Circle]], a group of left-wing intellectuals which included psychoanalyst [[René Spitz]]. In 1919, she worked for the Commissariat for Education during the short-lived [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]].

When the republic fell following the [[Hungarian–Romanian War|Romanian invasion]], she fled to [[Vienna]], where she supported herself by working at a parachute factory, and then as a sales assistant at a bookshop.  She knew the Hungarian writers [[Béla Balázs]], composer [[Hanns Eisler]], Czech writer [[Egon Kisch]] and [[Hermann Broch]] - who translated her poetry into German. Thereafter she was for short periods in [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Romania]]. After being expelled from Romania for her communism, she settled in Berlin in 1923, with her second husband Laszlo Tology (Gluck). She designed costumes for the films of [[Elisabeth Bergner]] at the Neumann Produktion film studio, translated, interpreted and took photographs. She also worked on the staff of the [[Rote Hilfe]] newspaper of the [[German Communist Party]] for a time. She studied psychoanalysis from 1924 onwards. After undertaking training analysis with [[Otto Fenichel]], she later practiced as an analyst.<ref>Endre Kiss, [http://www.pointernet.pds.hu/kissendre/judaisztika/20100228010400151000000810.html Edit Gyömrői and Hermann Broch].</ref>

She was the therapist of the Hungarian poet [[Attila József]], who wrote his most famous love poems to her.

When [[Hitler]] came to power in 1933, Gyömrői emigrated to Prague, due to her being [[jewish]], along with her political views, which were opposed to the Nazi party ideologies. The following year she returned to Budapest, where she joined the Hungarian Psychoanalytical Society.<ref name="theisland"/> Between 1936 and 1938, she held seminars and discussion evenings, for mothers and educators on practical educational issues.

==Moving to Sri Lanka==
In 1938, when [[Admiral Horthy]]'s fascist regime passed its first Anti-Jewish Law, she emigrated to Sri Lanka<ref>[http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2004/04/11/fea15.html Defining our modern cultural history: (VIII) Edith Ludowyk-Gyomroi] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050219061821/http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2004/04/11/fea15.html |date=2005-02-19 }}. [[Sunday Observer (Sri Lanka)|Sunday Observer]]</ref> with her third husband, journalist Laszlo Ujvári, who died in 1940. She met and married [[E. F. C. Ludowyk]], Professor of English at the [[University College, Colombo]]. She joined the Trotskyist  [[Lanka Sama Samaja Party]] and in 1947, together with [[Vivienne Goonewardena]] and several other women of the LSSP, the [[Bolshevik Samasamaja Party]] and the [[Communist Party of Sri Lanka|Communist Party]], she founded the [[Eksath Kantha Peramuna]] (United Women's Front), the first autonomous [[socialist]] women's association in the country. In 1948, she published an article in [[The Times of Ceylon]] titled “Feminism or Socialism?”.<ref name="academia"/>

In 1956, because the island's humid climate caused her problems, the couple moved to London. There, Gyömrői became a recognized psychoanalyst, and continued her practice until she was 80.<ref name="theisland"/>

After the death of her husband in 1986, she moved with her colleagues Anne-Marie and [[Joseph J. Sandler]]. She died on 11 February 1987.<ref name="theisland"/>
