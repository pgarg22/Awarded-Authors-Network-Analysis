'''Thomas Campion''' (sometimes '''Campian'''; 12 February 1567 – 1 March 1620) was born in [[London]], educated at [[Cambridge]], studied [[law]] in Gray's inn. He was an English composer, poet, and physician. He wrote over a hundred [[lute song]]s, [[masque]]s for dancing, and an authoritative technical treatise on music.

==Life==
Campion was born in London, the son of John Campion, a clerk of the [[Court of Chancery]], and Lucy (née Searle – daughter of Laurence Searle, one of the Queen's [[Serjeant-at-Arms|serjeants-at-arms]]). Upon the death of Campion's father in 1576, his mother married Augustine Steward, dying soon afterwards. His stepfather assumed charge of the boy and sent him, in 1581, to study at [[Peterhouse, Cambridge]] as a "gentleman pensioner"; he left the university after four years without taking a degree.<ref name="brittanica1911">{{Cite EB1911|noicon=1|wstitle=Campion, Thomas}}.</ref><ref>He is not listed in Venn, ''Alumni Cantabrigienses''.</ref> He later entered [[Gray's Inn]] to study law in 1586. However, he left in 1595 without having been [[Call to the bar|called to the bar]].

On 10 February 1605, he received his medical degree from the [[University of Caen]].<ref name="grove">Christopher R. Wilson. "Thomas Campion", ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove Music Online]]'', ed. L. Macy (accessed 4 March 2006), [http://www.grovemusic.com/ grovemusic.com] (subscription access).</ref>

Campion is thought to have lived in London, practising as a physician, until his death in March 1620 – possibly of the [[Bubonic plague|plague]].<ref>[http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/campbio.htm Life of Thomas Campion] (Luminarium: Anthology of English literature).</ref> He was apparently unmarried and had no children. He was buried the same day at [[St Dunstan-in-the-West]] in [[Fleet Street]].<ref name="brittanica1911" />

He was implicated in the murder of Sir [[Thomas Overbury]], but was eventually exonerated, as it was found that he had ''unwittingly'' delivered the bribe that had procured Overbury's death.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gx5229/is_2003/ai_n19152457/ Thomas Campion] (UXL encyclopedia of world biography, 2003).</ref>

==Poetry and songs==
[[File:Houghton STC 21332 - Book of Ayres.jpg|thumb|''A Book of Ayres'', 1601, with words by Campion and music by [[Philip Rosseter]]]]
The body of his works is considerable, the earliest known being a group of five anonymous poems included in the "Songs of Divers Noblemen and Gentlemen," appended to [[Thomas Newman (publisher)|Newman]]'s edition of Sir [[Philip Sidney]]'s ''[[Astrophel and Stella]]'', which appeared in 1591. In 1595, ''Poemata, a collection of Latin panegyrics, elegies and epigrams'' was published, winning him a considerable reputation. This was followed, in 1601, by a songbook, ''A Booke of Ayres,'' with words by himself and music composed by himself and [[Philip Rosseter]]. The following year he published his ''Observations in the Art of English Poesie,'' "against the vulgar and unartificial custom of riming," in favour of rhymeless verse on the model of classical [[Meter (poetry)|quantitative verse]]. Campion's theories on poetry were criticized by [[Samuel Daniel]] in "Defence of Rhyme" (1603).<ref name="brittanica1911" />

In 1607, he wrote and published a [[Lord Hay's Masque|masque]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20040803143748/http://www.shipbrook.com/jeff/bookshelf/details.html?bookid=37 Lord Hayes' Masque] (Godfrey's Bookshelf).</ref> for the occasion of the marriage of [[James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle|Lord Hayes]], and, in 1613, issued a volume of ''Songs of Mourning: Bewailing the Untimely Death of [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince Henry]],'' set to music by [[John Cooper (composer)|John Cooper]] (also known as Coperario). The same year he wrote and arranged three masques: ''[[Wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Frederick V of the Palatinate|The Lords' Masque]]'' for the marriage of [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Princess Elizabeth]]; an entertainment for the amusement of [[Anne of Denmark|Queen Anne]] at [[Caversham Park|Caversham House]]; and a third for the marriage of the [[Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset|Earl of Somerset]] to the infamous [[Frances Carr, Countess of Somerset|Frances Howard, Countess of Essex]]. If, moreover, as appears quite likely, his ''Two Bookes of Ayres''<ref>[http://www.luminarium.org/editions/camptwobookes.htm Two Books of Airs] (Luminarium.org).</ref> (both words and music written by himself) belongs also to this year, it was indeed his ''annus mirabilis.''<ref name="brittanica1911" />

In 1615, he published a book on [[counterpoint]], ''A New Way of Making Fowre Parts in Counterpoint By a Most Familiar and Infallible Rule'',<ref>Thomas Campion, Christopher R. Wilson, John Coperario. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=zpwow7AiM_oC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false A new way of making fowre parts in counterpoint]'' (Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2003).</ref> a technical treatise which was for many years the standard textbook on the subject. It was included, with annotations by [[Christopher Sympson]], in [[John Playford|Playford]]'s ''Brief Introduction to the Skill of Musick,'' and two editions appear to have been published by 1660.<ref name="brittanica1911" /><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=KrQTAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Brief Introduction to the Skill of Musick]</ref>

Some time in or after 1617 appeared his ''Third and Fourth Booke of Ayres''.<ref>[http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/campbib.htm Works of Thomas Campion] (Luminarium.org).</ref> In 1618 appeared the airs that were sung and played at [[Brougham Castle#The Clifford Dowagers|Brougham Castle]] on the occasion of the King's entertainment there, the music by George Mason and John Earsden, while the words were almost certainly by Campion. In 1619, he published his ''Epigrammatum Libri II. Umbra Elegiarum liber unus'', a reprint of his 1595 collection with considerable omissions, additions (in the form of another book of epigrams) and corrections.<ref name="brittanica1911" />

==Legacy==
[[File:Thomas Campion Signature.png|thumb|269x269px|Minutes of the examination of Thomas Campion on the 26th Oct. 16 15, prior to the arrest of Sir Thomas Monson for complicity in the Overbury murder.]]
Campion made a [[Oral will|nuncupative will]] on 1 March 1619/20 before 'divers credible witnesses': a memorandum was made that he did 'not longe before his death say that he did give all that he had unto Mr Phillip Rosseter, and wished that his estate had bin farre more', and Rosseter was sworn before Dr Edmund Pope to administer as principal legatee on 3 March 1619/20.<ref>London Metropolitan Archives and Guildhall Library Manuscripts Section, Ref. MS 9172/31, Will number 150.</ref>

While Campion had attained a considerable reputation in his own day, in the years that followed his death his works sank into complete oblivion. No doubt this was due to the nature of the media in which he mainly worked, the masque and the song-book. The masque was an amusement at any time too costly to be popular, and during the [[Commonwealth of England|commonwealth]] period it was practically extinguished. The vogue of the song-books was even more ephemeral, and, as in the case of the masque, the [[Puritan]] ascendancy, with its distaste for all secular music, effectively put an end to the [[Madrigal (music)|madrigal]]. Its loss involved that of many hundreds of dainty lyrics, including those of Campion, and it was due to the work of [[Arthur Henry Bullen|A. H. Bullen]] (see bibliography), who first published a collection of the poet's works in 1889, that his genius was recognised and his place among the foremost rank of [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] lyric poets restored.<ref name="brittanica1911" />

Early dictionary writers, such as [[Fétis]], saw Campion as a theorist.<ref name="fetis">François-Joseph Fétis, 'Campion' in: ''[https://archive.org/details/biographieuniver02ft Biographie universelle des musiciens et bibliographie générale de la musique, vol. 3]'' (2nd edition, Paris, 1867) p. 169.</ref> It was much later on that people began to see him as a composer. He was the writer of a poem, ''Cherry Ripe'', which is not the [[Cherry Ripe (song)|later famous poem of that title]] but has several similarities.

===In popular culture===
Repeated reference was made to Campion (1567-1620) in an October 2010 episode of the [[BBC TV]] series, ''[[James May's Man Lab]]'' ([[BBC2]]), where his works are used as the inspiration for a young man trying to serenade a female colleague.  This segment was referenced in the second and third series of the programme as well.

Occasional mention is made of Campion ("Campian") in the comic strip [[9 Chickweed Lane]] (i.e., 5 April 2004), referencing historical context for playing the lute.
