'''George Murnu''' ({{IPA-ro|ˈɟe̯orɟe ˈmurnu}}; [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]]: '''Ioryi al Murnu'''; 1 January 1868, [[Veria]], [[Salonica Vilayet]], [[Ottoman Empire]], now in [[Greece]] – 17 November 1957, [[Bucharest]]) was a [[Romania]]n university professor, archaeologist, historian, translator, and poet of [[Aromanians|Aromanian]] origin.

After attending the courses of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060101124750/http://www.vlachophiles.net/rom_schools.htm Romanian primary and secondary schools] in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] at [[Bitola]], he attended the [[University of Bucharest]]. In 1893, at age 25, Murnu was appointed professor at the [[University of Iaşi]] and shortly afterwards was awarded a [[scholarship]] by the Romanian State in order to complete his postgraduate studies in [[Munich]], and, after several years he returned to Romania after completing a [[doctorate]] in [[philology]]. A fruitful scholarly activity followed, culminating in Murnu becoming a chairman professor of archaeology at the University of Bucharest.

In 1909, he was appointed head of the National Archaeological Museum in Bucharest by the Ministry of Public Instruction and Religious Confessions.  He has translated an accomplished version of the ''[[Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Iliad]]'' into [[Romanian language|Romanian]]. He also wrote his own works of poetry (with [[bucolic]] themes), both in Romanian and in his native [[Aromanian language]].

Murnu was a sympathizer of the [[far right]] [[Iron Guard]], and was an intimate friend of the Aromanian [[separatism|secessionist]] politician, [[Alcibiades Diamandi]] who in 1917 participated in a failed effort to form an independent [[Principality of Pindus]] under the protection of Italy. After the end of [[World War II]], Murnu was not subject to legal investigation - probably due to his age and prestige.

He was elected a full [[list of members of the Romanian Academy|member of the Romanian Academy]]. Nowadays, a [https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=strada+george+murnu+mangalia&btnG=Google+Search&meta= street] in the Romanian [[Black Sea]] port of [[Mangalia]] bears his name.
