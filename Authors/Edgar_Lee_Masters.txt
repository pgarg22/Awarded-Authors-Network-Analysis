==Life and career==
Born in [[Garnett, Kansas]], to attorney Hardin Wallace Masters and Emma J. Dexter,<ref>[http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/m_r/masters/life.htm Profile], illinois.edu. Retrieved December 13, 2015.</ref> his father had briefly moved to set up a law practice, then soon moved back to his paternal grandparents' farm near [[Petersburg, Illinois|Petersburg]] in [[Menard County, Illinois]]. In 1880 they moved to [[Lewistown, Illinois]], where he attended high school and had his first publication in the ''[[Chicago Daily News]]''. The culture around Lewistown, in addition to the town's cemetery at [[Oak Hill Cemetery (Lewistown, Illinois)|Oak Hill]] and the nearby [[Spoon River]], were the inspirations for many of his works, most notably ''[[Spoon River Anthology]]'', his most famous and acclaimed work.<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/84/22.html Profile], bartleby.com. Retrieved December 13, 2015.</ref>

He attended Knox Academy in 1889–90, a now defunct preparatory program run by [[Knox College (Illinois)|Knox College]], but was forced to leave due to his family's inability to finance his education.<ref name=poets.org>{{cite web|url=http://www.poets.org/elmas|title=Edgar Lee Masters profile, ibid|publisher=Poets.org|access-date=10 September 2013}}</ref>
  
After working in his father's law office, he was [[Admission to the bar|admitted]] to the Illinois bar and moved to Chicago, where he established a law partnership in 1893 with the law firm of Kickham Scanlan. He married twice. In 1898 he married Helen M. Jenkins, the daughter of Robert Edwin Jenkins, a lawyer in Chicago, and had three children. During his law partnership with [[Clarence Darrow]] from 1903 to 1908, Masters defended the poor. In 1911 he started his own law firm, despite three years of unrest (1908–11) caused by extramarital affairs and an argument with Darrow. {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Two of his children followed him with literary careers. His daughter Marcia pursued poetry, while his son [[Hilary Masters]] became a novelist. Hilary and his half-brother Hardin wrote a memoir of their father.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jackmasters.net/mastelm.html|title=Jack Masters profile|publisher=Jackmasters.net|access-date=10 September 2013}}</ref>

Masters died in poverty at a nursing home on March 5, 1950, in [[Melrose Park, Pennsylvania]], age 81.<ref name=Ehrlich209>Ehrlich, Eugene and Gorton Carruth. ''The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1982: p. 206; {{ISBN|0-19-503186-5}}</ref> He is buried in Oakland cemetery in Petersburg, Illinois. His [[epitaph]] includes his poem, "To-morrow is My Birthday" from ''Toward the Gulf'' (1918):

<blockquote><poem>
"Good friends, let's to the fields ...
After a little walk, and by your pardon,
I think I'll sleep. There is no sweeter thing,
Nor fate more blessed than to sleep.

I am a dream out of a blessed sleep –
Let's walk, and hear the lark."
</poem></blockquote>

===Family history===
Edgar's father was Hardin Wallace Masters, whose father was Squire Davis Masters, whose father was Thomas Masters, whose father was Hillery Masters, the son of Robert Masters (born c. 1715, [[Prince George's County, Maryland]], the son of William W. Masters and wife Mary Veatch Masters). Edgar Lee Masters wrote in his autobiography, ''Across Spoon River'' (1936), that his ancestor Hillery Masters was the son of "Knotteley" Masters, but family genealogies show that Hillery and Notley Masters were, in fact, brothers.<ref>[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/45819884l The Masters Family], findagrave.com.

==Poetry==
{{more citations needed section|date=December 2015}}
Masters first published his early poems and essays under the pseudonym '''Dexter Wallace''' (after his mother's maiden name and his father's middle name) until the year 1903, when he joined the law firm of [[Clarence Darrow]]. Masters began developing as a notable American poet in 1914, when he began a series of poems (this time under the pseudonym Webster Ford) about his childhood experiences in Western Illinois, which appeared in ''[[Reedy's Mirror]]'', a St. Louis publication.

In 1915 the series was bound into a volume and re-titled ''[[Spoon River Anthology]]''. Years later, he wrote a memorable and invaluable account of the book's background and genesis, his working methods and influences, as well as its reception by the critics, favorable and hostile, in an autobiographical article notable for its human warmth and general interest.<ref>Edgar Lee Masters, "The Genesis of Spoon River", ''American Mercury'', v. 28, no. 109 (January 1933), pp. 38–55.</ref>

Although he never matched the success of his ''Spoon River Anthology'', he did publish several other volumes of poems including ''Book of Verses'' in 1898, ''Songs and Sonnets'' in 1910, ''The Great Valley'' in 1916, ''Song and Satires'' in 1916, ''The Open Sea'' in 1921, ''The New Spoon River'' in 1924, ''Lee'' in 1926, ''Jack Kelso'' in 1928, ''Lichee Nuts'' in 1930, ''Gettysburg, Manila, Acoma'' in 1930, ''Godbey,'' sequel to ''Jack Kelso'' in 1931, ''The Serpent in the Wilderness'' in 1933, ''Richmond'' in 1934, ''Invisible Landscapes'' in 1935, ''The Golden Fleece of California'' in 1936, ''Poems of People'' in 1936, ''The New World'' in 1937, and ''More People'' in 1939.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Two of his later volumes were published by the [[Decker Press]] after its founder, James Decker, asked Masters for permission to print his work; Masters agreed and ''Illinois Poems'' was published in 1941 and ''Along the Illinois'' was released in 1942.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hallwas|first=John|title=Western Illinois Heritage|publisher=Illinois Heritage Press|year=1983|isbn=978-9994715442|pages=187–189|chapter=Poetry and Murder: Prairie City's Decker Press}}</ref>
