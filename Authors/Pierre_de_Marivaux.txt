'''Pierre Carlet de Chamblain de Marivaux''' (4 February 1688 – 12 February 1763), commonly referred to as '''Marivaux''', was a French [[playwright]] and [[novelist]].

He is considered one of the most important French playwrights of the 18th century, writing numerous [[comedy|comedies]] for the [[Comédie-Française]] and the [[Comédie-Italienne]] of Paris. His most important works are ''[[Le Triomphe de l'amour]]'', ''[[Le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard]]'' and ''[[Les Fausses Confidences]]''. He also published a number of essays and two important but [[unfinished work|unfinished]] novels, ''[[La Vie de Marianne]]'' and ''[[Le Paysan parvenu]]''.<ref name=EB1911/>

==Life==
His father was a [[Normandy|Norman]] financier whose name from birth was Carlet, but who assumed the surname of Chamblain, and then that of Marivaux.  He brought up his family in [[Limoges]] and [[Riom]], in the province of [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]], where he directed the mint.<ref name=EB1911/>

Marivaux is said to have written his first play, the ''Père prudent et équitable'', when he was only eighteen, but it was not published until 1712, when he was twenty-four. However, the young Marivaux concentrated more on writing novels than plays. In the three years from 1713 to 1715 he produced three novels – ''Effets surprenants de la sympathie''; ''La Voiture embourbée'', and a book which had three titles – ''Pharsamon'', ''Les Folies romanesques'', and ''Le Don Quichotte moderne''. These books are very different from his later, more famous pieces: they are inspired by Spanish romances and the heroic novels of the preceding century, with a certain mixture of the marvelous.<ref name=EB1911/>

Then Marivaux's literary ardour took a new phase. He parodied [[Homer]] to serve the cause of [[Antoine Houdar de La Motte]], (1672–1731) an ingenious paradoxer; Marivaux had already done something similar for [[François Fénelon]], whose ''Telemachus'' he parodied and updated as ''Le Telemaque travesti'' (written in 1714 but not published until 1736). His friendship with [[Antoine Houdar de La Motte]] introduced him to the ''Mercure'', the chief newspaper of France, and he started writing articles for it in 1717.  His work was noted for its keen observation and literary skill. His work showed the first signs of "marivaudage," which now signifies the flirtatious bantering tone characteristic of Marivaux's dialogues.<ref name=EB1911/> In 1742 he became acquainted with the then unknown [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] helping him revise a play ''Narcissus'' though it wasn't produced till long afterwards.<ref>{{cite book|title=Jean-Jacques Rousseau: Restless Genius|author=Leo Damrosch|year=2007|publisher=Mariner Books}}</ref>

Marivaux is reputed to have been a witty conversationalist, with a somewhat contradictory personality. He was extremely good-natured, but fond of saying very severe things, unhesitating in his acceptance of favours (he drew a regular annuity from [[Claude Adrien Helvétius]]), but exceedingly touchy if he thought himself in any way slighted. At the same time, he was a great cultivator of sensibility and unsparingly criticized the rising ''philosophes''. Perhaps for this reason, [[Voltaire]] became his enemy and often disparaged him. Marivaux' friends included Helvétius, [[Claudine Guérin de Tencin]], [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle]] and even [[Madame de Pompadour]] (who allegedly provided him with a pension).  Marivaux had one daughter, who became a nun; the duke of Orleans, the regent's successor, furnished her with her dowry.<ref name=EB1911/>

==Literary career==

The early 1720s were very important for Marivaux; he wrote a comedy (now mostly lost) called ''L'Amour et la vérité'', another comedy, ''[[Arlequin poli par l'amour]]'', and an unsuccessful tragedy, ''Annibal'' (printed 1737).  In about 1721, he married a Mlle Martin, but she died shortly thereafter.  Meanwhile, he lost all of his inheritance money when he invested it in the [[Mississippi Company|Mississippi scheme]].  His pen now became almost his sole resource.<ref name=EB1911/>

Marivaux had a connection with both the fashionable theatres: ''Annibal'' had played at the Comédie Française and ''Arlequin poli'' at the Comédie Italienne. He also endeavoured to start a weekly newspaper, the ''Spectateur Français'', to which he was the sole contributor. But his irregular work ethic killed the paper after less than two years.  Thus, for nearly twenty years the theatre, especially the Comédie Italienne, was Marivaux's chief support. His plays were well received by the actors of the Comédie Française, but were rarely successful there.<ref name=EB1911/>

Marivaux wrote between 30 and 40 plays, the best of which are ''[[La Surprise de l'amour]]'' (1722), the ''Triomphe de Plutus'' (1728), ''Jeu de l'amour et du hasard'' (1730) ([[The Game of Love and Chance]]), ''Les Fausses confidences'' (1737), all produced at the Italian theatre, and ''Le Legs'' (1736), produced at the French.  At intervals, he returned to journalism: a [[periodical publication]] called ''L'Indigent philosophe'' appeared in 1727, and another called ''Le Cabinet du philosophe'' in 1734.  But the same causes which had proved fatal to the ''Spectateur'' prevented these later efforts from succeeding.<ref name=EB1911/>

In 1731 Marivaux published the first two parts of his great novel, ''Marianne''. The eleven parts appeared at intervals over the next eleven years, but the novel was never finished. In 1735 another novel, ''Le Paysan parvenu'', was begun, but this also was left unfinished.  Marivaux was elected a member of the [[Académie française]] in 1742.  For the next twenty years, he contributed occasionally to the ''Mercure'', wrote plays and reflections (which were seldom of much worth), and so forth. He died on 12 February 1763, aged seventy-five.<ref name=EB1911/>

==''Marivaudage''==
The so-called ''Marivaudage'' is the main point of importance about Marivaux's literary work, though the best of the comedies have great merits, and ''Marianne'' is an extremely important step in the development of the French novel. That, and ''Le Paysan parvenu'', have some connection to the work of [[Samuel Richardson]] and [[Henry Fielding]]. In general, Marivaux's subject matter is the so-called "metaphysic of love-making." As [[Prosper Jolyot de Crébillon|Claude Prosper Jolyot Crébillon]] said, Marivaux's characters not only tell each other and the reader everything they have thought, but everything that they would like to persuade themselves that they have thought.<ref name=EB1911/>

This style derives mainly from Fontenelle and the ''Précieuses'', though there are traces of it even in [[Jean de La Bruyère]]. It abuses metaphor somewhat, and delights to turn off a metaphor in an unexpected and bizarre fashion. Sometimes a familiar phrase is used where dignified language would be expected; sometimes the reverse.  Crébillon also described Marivaux's style as an introduction of words to each other, which have never made acquaintance and which think that they will not get on together (this phrase is itself rather Marivaux-esque). This kind of writing, of course, recurs at several periods of literature, especially at the end of the 19th century.  This fantastic embroidery of language has a certain charm, and suits the somewhat unreal gallantry and sensibility which it describes and exhibits. Marivaux possessed, moreover, both thought and observation, besides considerable command of pathos.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|wstitle=Marivaux, Pierre Carlet de Chamblain de|inline=1}}</ref>

Marivaux's play ''[[The Triumph of Love (play)|The Triumph of Love]]'' (1732) was filmed in English in 2001 as ''[[The Triumph of Love (2001 film)|The Triumph of Love]]'', starring [[Mira Sorvino]], [[Ben Kingsley]], and [[Fiona Shaw]].<ref>{{IMDb title|0253840|The Triumph of Love (2001)}}</ref> It is, so far, the only one of Marivaux's plays ever to be filmed in English. The film received modestly favourable reviews, but was not a [[box office]] success.

In the French film ''[[Games of Love and Chance|L'Esquive]]'' (2003), directed by [[Abdellatif Kechiche]], Arab-French adolescents in a Paris suburb prepare and perform Marivaux's play ''[[Le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard]]''.
