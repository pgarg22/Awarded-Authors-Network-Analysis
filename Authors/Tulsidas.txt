'''Tulsidas''' ({{IPA-hi|t̪ʊls̪iːd̪aːs̪}}; 1532<ref name="avinashray-tulsiprakash" />–1623), also known as '''Goswami Tulsidas''',<ref name="frommer"/> was a [[Ramanandi Sampradaya|Ramanandi]] [[Vaishnava]] [[Hindu]] saint and poet, renowned for his devotion to the deity [[Rama]]. He wrote several popular works in [[Sanskrit]] and [[Awadhi language|Awadhi]], but is best known as the author of the epic ''[[Ramacharitamanasa|<span lang="hi" dir="ltr">Ramcharitmanas</span>]]'', a retelling of the [[Sanskrit]] ''[[Ramayana]]'' based on [[Rama]]'s life in the vernacular [[Awadhi language|Awadhi]].

Tulsidas spent most of his life in the city of [[Varanasi]] and [[Ayodhya]].<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Prasad|2008|p=857}}, quoting Mata Prasad Gupta: Although he paid occasional visits to several places of pilgrimage associated with Rama, his permanent residence was in Kashi.</ref> The [[Tulsi Ghat]] on the [[Ganges River]] in [[Varanasi]] is named after him.<ref name="frommer">{{cite book| last1=de Bruyn | first1=Pippa | last2=Bain | first2=Dr. Keith | last3=Allardice | first3=David | last4=Joshi | first4=Shonar | title=Frommer's India | year=2010 | publisher=John Wiley and Sons | isbn=9780470602645 | location=Hoboken, New Jersey, United States of America | page=471}}</ref> He founded the [[Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple (Varanasi)|Sankatmochan Temple]] dedicated to Lord [[Hanuman]] in Varanasi, believed to stand at the place where he had the sight of the deity.<ref>{{cite book| last1=Callewaert | first1=Winand M. | last2=Schilder | first2=Robert | title=Banaras: Vision of a Living Ancient Tradition | year=2000 | publisher=Hemkunt Press | isbn=9788170103028 | location=New Delhi, India | page=90}}</ref> Tulsidas started the [[Ramlila]] plays, a folk-theatre adaption of the Ramayana.<ref name="handoo-ramlila">{{Harvnb|Handoo|1964|p=128}}: ... this book ... is also a drama, because Goswami Tulasidasa started his ''Ram Lila'' on the basis of this book, which even now is performed in the same manner everywhere.</ref>

Long before the airing of the main story concluded on 31 July 1988, the Ramayan had become the most popular program ever shown on Indian television, drawing an estimated one hundred million viewers and generating unprecedented advertising revenues.

==Transliteration and etymology==

The Sanskrit name of Tulsidas can be transliterated in two ways. Using the original Sanskrit, the name is written as ''Tulasīdāsa''. Using the [[Hunterian transliteration]] system, it is written as ''Tulsidas'' or ''Tulsīdās'' reflecting the vernacular pronunciation (since the written Indian languages maintain the vestigial letters that are no longer pronounced). The lost vowels are an aspect of the [[Schwa deletion in Indo-Aryan languages]] and can vary between regions. The name is a [[Sanskrit compounds|compound]] of two Sanskrit words: [[Ocimum tenuiflorum|Tulasī]], which is an Indian variety of the [[basil]] plant considered auspicious by [[Vaishnava]]s (devotees of god [[Vishnu]] and his [[avatar]]s like Rama),<ref>{{cite book|last=Flood|first=Gavin D.|title=The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2003|isbn=9780631215356|edition=Illustrated|location=Hoboken, New Jersey, United States of America|page=331|author-link=Gavin Flood}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Simoons | first=Frederick J. | title=Plants of life, plants of death | publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press | location=Madison, Wisconsin, United States of America | year=1998 | edition=1st | pages=7–40 | isbn=9780299159047}}</ref> and [[Dasa#Dasa.2C in Hinduism|Dāsa]], which means ''slave'' or ''servant'' and by extension, ''devotee''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Monier-Williams|first=Sir Monier|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zUezTfym7CAC&q=A+Sanskrit-English+dictionary:+etymologically+and+philologically+arranged+with+special+reference+to+cognate+Indo-European+languages|title=A Sanskrit-English dictionary: etymologically and philologically arranged with special reference to cognate Indo-European languages|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|year=2005|isbn=9788120831056|location=New Delhi, India|page=[https://books.google.co.in/books?id=zUezTfym7CAC&PA477&ved=2ahUKEwjkua-fy_ruAhW_4zgGHWZgCaUQ6AEwAHoECAYQAg 477]|author-link=Monier Monier-Williams|orig-year=1899}}</ref>

Tulsidas himself has given only a few facts and hints about events of his life in various works. Till late nineteenth century, the two widely known ancient sources on Tulsidas' life were the ''[[Bhaktamal]]'' composed by [[Nabha Dass|Nabhadas]] between 1583 and 1639, and a commentary on ''Bhaktamal'' titled ''Bhaktirasbodhini'' composed by Priyadas in 1712.<ref name="lutgengorf-tulsi">{{cite book| last=Lutgendorf | first=Philip | year=1994 | editor1-first=Winand M. | editor1-last=Callewaert | editor2-first=Rupert | editor2-last=Snell | title=According to Tradition: Hagiographical Writing in India | publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag | isbn=9783447035248 | location=Wiesbaden, Germany | pages=65–85 | chapter=The quest for the legendary Tulsidās}}</ref> Nabhadas was a contemporary of Tulsidas and wrote a six-line stanza on Tulsidas describing him as an incarnation of Valmiki. Priyadas' work was composed around a hundred years after the death of Tulsidas and had eleven additional stanzas, describing seven miracles or spiritual experiences from the life of Tulsidas.<ref name="lutgengorf-tulsi"/> During the 1920s, two more ancient biographies of Tulsidas were published based on old manuscripts – the ''Mula Gosain Charit'' composed by Veni Madhav Das in 1630 and the ''Gosain Charit'' composed by Dasanidas (also known as Bhavanidas) around 1770.<ref name="lutgengorf-tulsi"/> Veni Madhav Das was a disciple and contemporary of Tulsidas and his work gave a new date for Tulsidas' birth. The work by Bhavanidas presented more narratives in greater detail as compared to the work by Priyadas. In the 1950s a fifth ancient account was published based on an old manuscript, the ''Gautam Chandrika'' composed by Krishnadatta Misra of Varanasi in 1624.<ref name="lutgengorf-tulsi"/> Krishnadatta Misra's father was a close companion of Tulsidas. The accounts published later are not considered authentic by some modern scholars, whereas some other scholars have been unwilling to dismiss them. Together, these five works form a set of traditional biographies on which modern biographies of Tulsidas are based.<ref name="lutgengorf-tulsi"/>

===Incarnation of Valmiki===

He is believed by many to be a rebirth of [[Valmiki]].<ref name="jonesryan-tulsi"/> In the Hindu scripture ''[[Bhavishya Purana|Bhavishyottar Purana]]'', the god [[Shiva]] tells his wife [[Parvati]] how Valmiki, who got a boon from Hanuman to sing the glory of Rama in vernacular language, will incarnate in future in the [[Kali Yuga]] (the present and last [[Yuga]] or epoch within a cycle of four Yugas).<ref name="rambhadracharya-tulsi-birth">Rambhadracharya 2008, p. xxv.</ref>

</blockquote>

Nabhadas writes in his ''Bhaktamal'' (literally, ''the Garland of bhakt or devotee'') that Tulsidas was the re-incarnation of Valmiki in the [[Kali Yuga]].<ref name="lutgendorf-tulsi"/><ref>Growse 1914, p. v.</ref><ref name="Prasad 2008, p. xix">Prasad 2008, p. xix.</ref><ref name="lamb-p38">Lamb 2002, p. 38</ref> The [[Ramanandi]] sect believes that it was Valmiki himself who incarnated as Tulsidas in the Kali Yuga.<ref name="rambhadracharya-tulsi-birth"/>

According to a traditional account, Hanuman went to Valmiki numerous times to hear him sing the Ramayana, but Valmiki turned down the request saying that Hanuman being a monkey was unworthy of hearing the epic.<ref name="rambhadracharya-tulsi-birth"/> After the victory of Rama over [[Ravana]], [[Hanuman]] went to the Himalayas to continue his worship of Rama. There he scripted a play version of the Ramayana called ''Mahanataka'' or ''Hanuman Nataka'' engraved on the Himalayan rocks using his nails.<ref name="kapoor-mahanataka">{{cite book | year=2004 | title = A Dictionary of Hinduism: Including Its Mythology, Religion, History, Literature and Pantheon | editor-last=Kapoor | editor-first=Subodh | publisher=Genesis Publishing Pvt Ltd | location=New Delhi, India | isbn=9788177558746 | page=159}}</ref> When Valmiki saw the play written by Hanuman, he anticipated that the beauty of the ''Mahanataka'' would eclipse his own Ramayana. Hanuman was saddened at Valmiki's state of mind and, being a true [[bhakta]] without any desire for glory, Hanuman cast all the rocks into the ocean, some parts of which are believed to be available today as ''Hanuman Nataka''.<ref name="rambhadracharya-tulsi-birth"/><ref name="kapoor-mahanataka"/> After this, Valmiki was instructed by Hanuman to take birth as Tulsidas and compose the Ramayana in the vernacular.<ref name="rambhadracharya-tulsi-birth"/>

===Early life===

[[File:Tulsighat.jpg|thumb|Birthplace of Tulsidas]]

====Birth====
Tulsidas was born on [[Saptami]], the seventh day of [[Shukla Paksha]], the bright half of the lunar [[Hindu calendar]] month [[Shraavana]] (July–August).<ref name="lochtefeld"/><ref name="gp-rcm-tulsi-birth">Gita Press Publisher 2007, p. 25.</ref> Although as many as three places are mentioned as his birthplace, most scholars identify the place with Sookar Kshetra [[Soron]], District [[Kasganj district|Kasganj]] in [[Uttar Pradesh]], a village on the banks of the river [[Ganga]]. In 2012 Sukarkhet [[Soron]] was declared officially by the government of Uttar Pradesh as the birthplace of Tulsi Das.<ref name="avinashray-tulsiprakash" /><ref name="rambhadracharya-tulsi-birth"/><ref name="sivananda">{{cite web | url=http://www.divyajivan.org/articles/siva/tulsidas_article.htm | title=Goswami Tulsidas By Swami Sivananda | access-date=12 July 2011 | last=Sivananda | first=Swami | publisher=Sivananda Ashram, Ahmedabad}}</ref> His parents were Hulsi and Atmaram Dubey. Most sources identify him as a [[Saryupareen Brahmin]] of the [[Parashar]] ''[[Gotra]]'' (lineage), although some sources claim he was a [[Kanyakubja Brahmins|Kanyakubja]] or [[Sanadhya Brahmin]].<ref name="avinashray-tulsiprakash" /><ref name="rambhadracharya-tulsi-birth"/><ref name="sivananda"/>

There is difference of opinion among biographers regarding the year of birth of Tulsidas. Many sources rely on Veni Madhav Das' account in the ''Mula Gosain Charita'', which gives the year of Tulsidas' birth as [[Bikram Samwat|Vikrami Samvat]] 1554 (1497 CE).<ref name="ralhan-early">Ralhan 1997 pp. 187–194.</ref> These sources include Shivlal Pathak, popular editions of Ramcharitmanas (Gita Press, Naval Kishore Press and Venkateshvar Press), Edwin Greaves, [[Hanuman Prasad Poddar]], Ramanand Sarasvati, Ayodhyanath Sharma, [[Ramchandra Shukla]], Narayandas, and [[Rambhadracharya]].<ref name="avinashray-tulsiprakash" /><ref name="rambhadracharya-tulsi-birth"/> A second group of biographers led by Sant Tulsi Sahib of Hathras and [[George Abraham Grierson|Sir George Grierson]] give the year as Vikram 1568 (1511 CE).<ref name="avinashray-tulsiprakash" /><ref name="ralhan-early"/> These biographers include Ramkrishna Gopal Bhandarkar, Ramghulam Dwivedi, James Lochtefeld, [[Sivananda Saraswati|Swami Sivananda]] and others.<ref name="avinashray-tulsiprakash" /><ref name="lochtefeld"/><ref name="sivananda"/> The year 1497 appears in many current-day biographies in India and in popular culture. Biographers who disagree with this year argue that it makes the life span of Tulsidas equal 126 years, which in their opinion is ''unlikely if not impossible''. In contrast, Ramchandra Shukla says that an age of 126 is not impossible for a [[Mahatma]] (''great soul'') like Tulsidas. The [[Government of India]] and provincial governments celebrated the 500th birth anniversary of Tulsidas in the year 1997 CE, according to the year of Tulsidas' birth in popular culture.<ref name="avinashray-tulsiprakash" />

====Childhood====

Legend goes that Tulsidas was born after staying in the womb for twelve months, he had all thirty two teeth in his mouth at birth, his health and looks were like that of a five-year-old boy, and he did not cry at the time of his birth but uttered ''Rama'' instead.<ref name="sivananda"/><ref name="shukla-early">Shukla 2002, pp. 27–30.</ref><ref name="rambhadracharya-tulsi-early">Rambhadracharya 2008, pp. xxvi–xxix.</ref><ref name="gp-rcm-tulsi-early">Gita Press Publisher 2007, pp. 25–27.</ref><ref name="tripathi-early">Tripathi 2004, pp. 47–50.</ref> He was therefore named ''Rambola'' (literally, ''he who uttered Rama''), as Tulsidas himself states in ''[[Vinaya Patrika]]''.<ref name="vp76">Poddar 1997, pp. 112–113 (Stanza 76).</ref> As per the ''Mula Gosain Charita'', he was born under the ''Abhuktamūla'' constellation, which according to [[Jyotisha]] (Hindu astrology) causes immediate danger to the life of the father.<ref name="gp-rcm-tulsi-early"/><ref name="tripathi-early"/><ref name="pandey-tulsiearly">Pandey 2008, pp. 34–44.</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Bhat | first=M. Ramakrishna | title=Fundamentals of Astrology | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ | year=1988 | edition=3rd | page=52 | isbn=9788120802766 | location=New Delhi, India}}</ref> Due to the inauspicious events at the time of his birth, he was abandoned by his parents on the fourth night, sent away with Chuniya (some sources call her Muniya), a female servant of Hulsi.<ref name="ralhan-early"/><ref name="shukla-early"/><ref name="rambhadracharya-tulsi-early"/> In his works ''Kavitavali'' and ''Vinayapatrika'', Tulsidas attests to his parents abandoning him after birth due to an inauspicious astrological configuration.<ref name="lamb-p38">Lamb 2002, p. 38</ref><ref>Lutgendorf 1991, p. 6.</ref><ref>Indradevnarayan 1996, pp. 93–94, 101–102 (Quatrains 7.57, 7.73).</ref><ref>Poddar 1997, pp. 285–286, 337–338 (Stanzas 227, 275).</ref>

Chuniya took the child to her village of Haripur and looked after him for five and a half years after which she died.<ref name="shukla-early"/><ref name="tripathi-early"/><ref name="pandey-tulsiearly"/> Rambola was left to fend for himself as an impoverished orphan, and wandered from door to door begging for alms.<ref name="ralhan-early"/><ref name="tripathi-early"/> It is believed that the goddess Parvati assumed the form of a Brahmin woman and fed Rambola every day.<ref name="rambhadracharya-tulsi-early"/><ref name="gp-rcm-tulsi-early"/>

====Initiation from guru and learning====

At the age of six, Rambola was adopted by Narharidas, a Vaishnava ascetic of [[Ramananda]]'s monastic order who is believed to be the fourth disciple of Ramananda,<ref name="rambhadracharya-tulsi-early"/> or alternately, the disciple of Anantacharya.<ref name="tripathi-early"/><ref name="pandey-tulsiearly"/> Rambola was given the ''Virakta Diksha'' (Vairagi initiation) with the new name of Tulsidas.<ref name="shukla-early"/> Tulsidas narrates the dialogue that took place during the first meeting with his guru in a passage in the ''Vinayapatrika''.<ref name="ralhan-early"/><ref name="vp76"/> When he was seven years old, his [[Upanayana]] ("sacred thread ceremony") was performed by Narharidas on the fifth day of the bright half of the month of [[Magha (month)|Magha]] (January–February) at [[Ayodhya]], a pilgrimage-site related to Rama. Tulsidas started his learning at Ayodhya. After some time, Narharidas took him to a particular ''Varaha Kshetra'' [[Soron]] (a holy place with temple dedicated to [[Varaha]] – the boar avatar of Vishnu), where he first narrated the Ramayana to Tulsidas.<ref name="gp-rcm-tulsi-early"/> Tulsidas mentions this in the Ramcharitmanas.<ref>Rambhadracharya 2008, p. 80.</ref>

Most authors identify the Varaha Kshetra referred to by Tulsidas with the Sookarkshetra is the [[Soron]] Varaha Kshetra in modern-day [[Kasganj District|Kasganj]],<ref name="gp-rcm-tulsi-early"/> Tulsidas further mentions in the Ramcharitmanas that his guru repeatedly narrated the Ramayana to him, which led him to understand it somewhat.<ref name="rambhadracharya-tulsi-early"/>

Tulsidas later came to the sacred city of Varanasi and studied [[Vyākaraṇa|Sanskrit grammar]], four [[Veda]]s, six [[Vedanga]]s, Jyotisha and the six schools of [[Hindu philosophy]] over a period of 15–16 years from guru Shesha Sanatana who was based at the Pancaganga Ghat in Varanasi.<ref name="shukla-early"/> Shesha Sanatana was a friend of Narharidas and a renowned scholar on literature and philosophy.<ref name="shukla-early"/><ref name="tripathi-early"/><ref name="pandey-tulsiearly"/><ref name="ralhan-testament">Ralhan 1997 pp. 197–207.</ref>

====Marriage and renunciation====

There are two contrasting views regarding the marital status of Tulsidas. According to the ''Mula Gosain Charita'' and some other works, Tulsidas was married to Ratnavali on the thirteenth day of the bright half of the [[Jyeshta]] month (May–June) in Vikram 1583 (1526 CE).<ref name="gp-rcm-tulsi-early"/> Ratnavali was the daughter of Dinbandhu Pathak, a Brahmin of the [[Bharadwaja]] Gotra, who belonged to Mahewa village of [[Kaushambi district]].<ref name="shukla-early"/><ref name="pandey-marriage">Pandey 2008, pp. 44–49.</ref><ref name="tripathi-later">Tripathi 2004, pp. 51–55</ref> They had a son named ''Tarak'' who died as a toddler.<ref name="tripathi-later"/> Once when Tulsidas had gone to a Hanuman temple, Ratnavali went to her father's home with her brother. When Tulsidas came to know this, he swam across the Yamuna river in the night to meet his wife.<ref name="pandey-marriage"/> Ratnavali chided Tulsidas for this, and remarked that if Tulsidas was even half as devoted to God as he was to her body of flesh and blood, he would have been redeemed.<ref name="shukla-early"/><ref name="gp-rcm-tulsi-early"/><ref>Pandey 2008 p. 49: As per the Mula Gosain Charita, Ratnavali said, "हाड़ माँस की देह मम तापर जितनी प्रीति। तिसु आधी जो राम प्रति अवसि मिटिहिं भवभीति॥." Acharya Ramchandra Shukla gives a slightly different version as "अस्थि चर्म मय देह मम तामे जैसी प्रीति। तैसी जो श्री राम मँह होत न तो भवभीति॥""</ref> Tulsidas left her instantly and left for the holy city of [[Allahabad|Prayag]]. Here, he renounced the [[Grihastha]] (householder's life) stage and became a [[Sadhu]] (Hindu ascetic).<ref name="ralhan-early"/><ref name="pandey-marriage"/>

Some authors consider the marriage episode of Tulsidas to be a later interpolation and maintain among that he was a [[Brahmacharya|bachelor]].<ref name="tripathi-early"/> They include Rambhadracharya, who cite two verses in the ''Vinayapatrika'' and ''Hanuman Bahuka'' to mean that Tulsidas never married and was a Sadhu from childhood.<ref name="rambhadracharya-tulsi-early"/>

====Travels====
After renunciation, Tulsidas spent most of his time at Varanasi, Prayag, Ayodhya, and Chitrakuta but visited many other nearby and far-off places. He travelled across India to many places, studying different people, meeting saints and Sadhus and meditating.<ref name="ralhan-quest">Ralhan 1997, pp. 194–197.</ref> The ''Mula Gosain Charita'' gives an account of his travels to the [[Char Dham|four pilgrimages]] of Hindus ([[Badrinath]], [[Dwarka]], [[Puri]] and [[Rameshwaram]]) and the [[Himalayas]].<ref name="ralhan-quest"/><ref name="shukla-later">Shukla 2002, pp. 30–32.</ref> He visited the [[Lake Manasarovar|Manasarovar lake]] in current-day [[Tibet]], where tradition holds he had [[Darśana|Darshan]] (sight) of [[:hi:काकभुशुण्डि|Kakabhushundi]],<ref name="gp-rcm-tulsi-later">Gita Press Publisher 2007, pp. 27–29.</ref> the crow who is one of the four narrators in the Ramcharitmanas.<ref name="lutgendorf-narrators">Lutgendorf 1991, p. 25.</ref>

====Darshan of Hanuman====
Tulsidas hints at several places in his works, that he had met face to face with Hanuman and Rama.<ref name="ralhan-quest"/><ref>Pradas 2008, p. 878, quoting J. L. Brockington: ... for in his more personal ''Vinayapatrika'' Tulasi alludes to having visions of Rama.</ref> The detailed account of his meetings with Hanuman and Rama are given in the ''Bhaktirasbodhini'' of Priyadas.<ref name="lutgendorf-darshan">Lutgendorf 1991, pp. 49–50.</ref> According to Priyadas' account, Tulsidas used to visit the woods outside Varanasi for his morning ablutions with a water pot. On his return to the city, he used to offer the remaining water to a certain tree. This quenched the thirst of a [[Preta]] (a type of ghost believed to be ever thirsty for water), who appeared to Tulsidas and offered him a boon.<ref name="lutgendorf-darshan"/><ref name="growse-darshan">Growse 1914, p. ix.</ref> Tulsidas said he wished to see Rama with his eyes, to which the Preta responded that it was beyond him. However, the Preta said that he could guide Tulsidas to Hanuman, who could grant the boon Tulsidas asked for. The Preta told Tulsidas that Hanuman comes everyday disguised in the mean attire of a leper to listen to his Katha, he is the first to arrive and last to leave.<ref name="ralhan-quest"/><ref name="lutgendorf-darshan"/>

That evening Tulsidas noted that the first listener to arrive at his discourse was an old leper, who sat at the end of the gathering. After the Katha was over, Tulsidas quietly followed the leper to the woods. In the woods, at the spot where the [[Sankat Mochan Temple]] stands today,<ref name="ralhan-quest"/><ref name="rambhadracharya-tulsi-later">Rambhadracharya 2008, pp. xxix–xxxiv.</ref> Tulsidas firmly fell at the leper's feet, shouting "I know who you are" and "You cannot escape me".<ref name="ralhan-quest"/><ref name="lutgendorf-darshan"/><ref name="growse-darshan"/> At first the leper feigned ignorance but Tulsidas did not relent. Then the leper revealed his original form of Hanuman and blessed Tulsidas. When granted a boon, Tulsidas told Hanuman he wanted to see Rama face to face. Hanuman told him to go to Chitrakuta where he would see Rama with his own eyes.<ref name="ralhan-quest"/><ref name="gp-rcm-tulsi-later"/><ref name="lutgendorf-darshan"/><ref name="growse-darshan"/>

At the beginning of the Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas bows down to a particular Preta and asks for his grace (Ramcharitmanas, Doha 1.7). According to Rambhadracharya, this is the same Preta which led Tulsidas to Hanuman.<ref name="rambhadracharya-tulsi-later"/>

====Darshan of Rama====
As per Priyadas' account, Tulsidas followed the instruction of Hanumana and started living in an Ashram at [[Chitrakoot Dham (Karwi)#Ramghat|Ramghat]] in Chitrakuta. One day Tulsidas went to perform the [[Parikrama (religious practice)|Parikrama]] (circumambulation) of the [[Chitrakoot Dham (Karwi)#Kamadgiri|Kamadgiri]] mountain. He saw two princes, one dark and the other fair, dressed in green robes pass by mounted on horsebacks. Tulsidas was enraptured at the sight, however he could not recognise them and took his eyes off them. Later Hanuman asked Tulsidas if he saw Rama and his brother [[Lakshmana]] on horses. Tulsidas was disappointed and repentful. Hanuman assured Tulsidas that he would have the sight of Rama once again the next morning.<ref name="ralhan-quest"/><ref name="gp-rcm-tulsi-later"/><ref name="rambhadracharya-tulsi-later"/> Tulsidas recalls this incident in a song of the ''Gitavali'' and laments how "his eyes turned his own enemies" by staying fixed to the ground and how everything happened in a trice.<ref name="ralhan-quest"/>

On the next morning, Wednesday, the new-moon day of Magha, Vikram 1607 (1551 CE) or 1621 (1565 CE) as per some sources, Rama again appeared to Tulsidas, this time as a child. Tulsidas was making sandalwood paste when a child came and asked for a sandalwood [[Tilaka]] (a religious mark on the forehead). This time Hanuman gave a hint to Tulsidas and he had a full view of Rama. Tulsidas was so charmed that he forgot about the sandalwood. Rama took the sandalwood paste and put a Tilaka himself on his forehead and Tulsidas' forehead before disappearing. This famous incidence is described in the verse चित्रकूट के घाट पर हुई संतन की भीर तुलसीदास चन्दन घिसे तिलक देते रघुबीर.<ref name="ralhan-quest"/><ref name="shukla-later"/><ref name="gp-rcm-tulsi-later"/><ref name="rambhadracharya-tulsi-later"/>

In a verse in the ''Vinayapatrika'', Tulsidas alludes to a certain "miracle at Chitrakuta", and thanks Rama for what he did for him at Chitrakuta.<ref>Poddar 1997, pp. 338–339 (Stanza 276).</ref> Some biographers conclude that the deed of Rama at Chitrakuta referred to by Tulsidas is the Darshan of Rama.<ref name="ralhan-quest"/><ref name="rambhadracharya-tulsi-later"/>

====Darshan of Yajnavalkya and Bharadvaja====
In Vikram 1628 (1572 CE), Tulsidas left Chitrakuta for Prayag where he stayed during the ''Magha Mela'' (the annual fair in January). Six days after the Mela ended, he had the Darshan of the sages [[Yajnavalkya]] and [[Bharadwaja|Bharadvaja]] under a banyan tree.<ref name="gp-rcm-tulsi-later"/> In one of the four dialogues in the Ramcharitmanas, Yajnavalkya is the speaker and Bharadvaja the listener.<ref name="lutgendorf-narrators"/> Tulsidas describes the meeting between Yajnavalkya and Bharadvaja after a Magha Mela festival in the Ramcharitmanas, it is this meeting where Yajnavalkya narrates the Ramcharitmanas to Bharadvaja.<ref>Rambhadracharya 2008, pp. 48–49 (Ramcharitmanas 1.44.1–44.6)</ref>

====Attributed miracles====
[[File:A Prince Visits the Poet Tulsidas.jpg|thumb|A Mughal prince visits Tulsidas. Early 18th century Sisodia dynasty painting from Udaipur, Mewar.]]
Most stories about Tulsidas tend to be apocryphal, and have been carried forward by word of mouth. None of them were related by Tulsi himself, thus making it difficult to separate fact from lore and fiction. In Priyadas' biography, Tulsidas is attributed with the power of working miracles.<ref name="lutgendorf-tulsi"/><ref name="macfie-miracles">Macfie 2004, p. xxiv</ref> In one such miracle, he is believed to have brought back a dead Brahmin to life.<ref name="macfie-miracles"/><ref name="growse-miracle">Growse 1914, p. ix–x.</ref><ref name="jpm-miracle1">Mishra 2010, pp. 22–24.</ref><ref name="singh-miracle">Singh 2008, pp. 29–30.</ref> While the Brahmin was being taken for cremation, his widow bowed down to Tulsidas on the way who addressed her as ''Saubhagyavati'' (a woman whose husband is alive).<ref name="growse-miracle"/> The widow told Tulsidas her husband had just died, so his words could not be true.<ref name="jpm-miracle1"/> Tulsidas said that the word has passed his lips and so he would restore the dead man to life. He asked everybody present to close their eyes and uttered the name of lord ''Rama'', on doing which the dead Brahmin was raised back to life.<ref name="growse-miracle"/><ref name="jpm-miracle1"/>

Tulsidas was acclaimed in his lifetime to be a reincarnation of [[Valmiki]], the composer of the original Ramayana in Sanskrit.<ref>Lutgendorf 2007, p. 293.</ref> He is also considered to be the composer of the [[Hanuman Chalisa]], a popular devotional hymn dedicated to [[Hanuman]],the monkey god and divine devotee of lord Rama.<ref>Rambhadracharya 2008, p. 306.</ref>

In another miracle described by Priyadas, the [[Mughal emperors|Mughal]] Emperor [[Akbar]] summoned Tulsidas on hearing of his bringing back a dead man to life.<ref name="macfie-miracles"/><ref name="growse-miracle"/><ref name="jpm-miracle2">Mishra 2010, p. 28–32</ref><ref name="pinch-miracle">{{cite book| last=Pinch | first=William R. | title=Warrior ascetics and Indian empires | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge, United Kingdom | year=2006 | isbn=9780521851688 | page=218}}</ref> Tulsidas declined to go as he was too engrossed in creating his verses but he was later forcibly brought before the Akbar and was asked to perform a miracle, which Tulsidas declined by saying "It's a lie, all I know is Rama."

===Literary life===

[[File:Gosvami Tulsidas.jpg|thumb|Tulsidas composes one of his works. Statue at Sant Tulsidas Municipal Inter College, [[Soron]], [[Kasganj district|Kasganj]], India.]]

Tulsidas started composing poetry in Sanskrit in Varanasi on the Prahlada Ghat. Tradition holds that all the verses that he composed during the day, would get lost in the night. This happened daily for eight days. On the eighth night, Shiva – whose famous [[Kashi Vishwanath Temple]] is located in Varanasi – is believed to have ordered Tulsidas in a dream to compose poetry in the vernacular instead of Sanskrit. Tulsidas woke up and saw both Shiva and Parvati who blessed him. Shiva ordered Tulsidas to go to Ayodhya and compose poetry in Awadhi. Shiva also predicted that Tulsidas' poetry would fructify like the [[Sama Veda]].<ref name="gp-rcm-tulsi-poetry">Gita Press Publisher 2007, pp. 29–32.</ref> In the Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas hints at having the Darshan of Shiva and Parvati in both dream and awakened state.<ref>Rambhadracharya 2008, p. 66 (Ramcharitmanas 1.15).</ref>

Tulsidas is also credited with having composed a number of wise sayings and ''dohas'' containing lessons for life. A popular one among them is:

आवत ही हरसय नहीं, नैनन नहीं सनोह ।
तुलसी वहाँ न जाइये, चाहे कञ्चन बरसे मेर ॥ सिया पति राम चन्द्र जी की जय , जय जय बजरंगबली ।।
(Aawat hi harshe nahin, nainan nahin saneh. Tulsi tahan na jaiye, chahe kanchan barse megh. Lit. A place where people are not happy or welcoming when you come, where their eyes have no affection for you, Don't go there, even if a mountain of gold is showered.)

====Composition of ''Ramcharitmanas''====

In the year Vikram 1631 (1575 CE), Tulsidas started composing the Ramcharitmanas in Ayodhya on Sunday, [[Ramnavami]] day (ninth day of the bright half of the [[Chaitra]] month, which is the birthday of Rama). Tulsidas himself attests this date in the Ramcharitmanas.<ref>Rambhadracharya 2008, pp. 38–39: संबत सोरह सै एकतीसा। करउँ कथा हरि पद धरि शीसा॥ नौमी भौम बार मधु मासा। अवधपुरी यह चरित प्रकासा॥ जेहि दिन राम जनम श्रुति गावहिं। तीरथ सकल इहाँ चलि आवहिं॥ (Ramcharitmanas, 1.34.4–1.34.6)</ref> He composed the epic over two years, seven months and twenty-six days, and completed the work in Vikram 1633 (1577 CE) on the [[Vivaha Panchami]] day (fifth day of the bright half of the [[Agrahayana|Margashirsha]] month, which commenrates the wedding of Rama and his wife [[Sita]]).<ref name="tripathi-later"/><ref name="gp-rcm-tulsi-poetry"/>

Tulsidas came to Varanasi and recited the Ramcharitmanas to Shiva (Vishwanath) and Parvati ([[Annapoorna devi|Annapurna]]) at the Kashi Vishwanath Temple. A popular legend goes that the Brahmins of Varanasi, who were critical of Tulsidas for having rendered the Sanskrit Ramayana in the Awadhi, decided to test the worth of the work. A manuscript of the Ramcharitmanas was kept at the bottom of pile of Sanskrit scriptures in the sanctum sanctorum of the Vishvanath temple in the night, and the doors of the sanctum sanctorum were locked. In the morning when the doors were opened, the Ramcharitmanas was found at the top of the pile. The words ''Satyam Shivam Sundaram'' (Sanskrit: सत्यं शिवं सुन्दरम्, literally "truth, auspiciousness, beauty") were inscribed on the manuscript with the signature of Shiva. The words were also heard by the people present.<ref name="gp-rcm-tulsi-poetry"/><ref>Lutgendorf 1991, pp. 9–10</ref><ref>Lamb 2002, p. 39</ref>

Per traditional accounts, some Brahmins of Varanasi were still not satisfied, and sent two thieves to steal the manuscript.<ref name="gp-rcm-tulsi-poetry"/><ref name="macfie-theft">Macfie 2004, pp. xxiii–xxiv.</ref> The thieves tried to break into the Ashram of Tulsidas, but were confronted by two guards with bows and arrows, of dark and fair complexion.<ref name="gp-rcm-tulsi-poetry"/> The thieves had a change of heart and came to Tulsidas in the morning to ask who the two guards were.<ref name="macfie-theft"/> Believing that the two guards could be none other than Rama and Lakshmana, Tulsidas was aggrieved to know that they were guarding his home at night.<ref name="gp-rcm-tulsi-poetry"/> He sent the manuscript of Ramcharitmanas to his friend [[Todar Mal]], the finance minister of [[Akbar]], and donated all his money.<ref name="gp-rcm-tulsi-poetry"/> The thieves were reformed and became devotees of Rama.<ref name="macfie-theft"/>

====Last compositions====
Around Vikram 1664 (1607 CE), Tulsidas was afflicted by acute pain all over his body, especially in his arms. He then composed the ''Hanuman Bahuk'', where he describes his bodily pain and suffering in several stanzas.<ref name="pandey-tulsilater">Pandey 2008, pp. 51–58.</ref> He was relieved of his pain after this composition. Later he was also afflicted by ''Bartod'' boils (Hindi: बरतोड़, furuncles caused by pulling out of the hair), which may have been the cause of his death.<ref name="pandey-tulsilater"/>

The [[Vinaya Patrika|Vinaypatrika]] is considered as the last compositions of Tulsidas, believed to be written when Kali Yuga started troubling him.<ref name="gp-rcm-tulsi-poetry"/> In this work of 279 stanzas, he beseeches Rama to give him Bhakti ("devotion"), and to accept his petition. Tulsidas attests in the last stanza of ''Vinaypatrika'' that Rama himself signed the manuscript of the work.<ref>Poddar 1997, pp. 341–342 (Stanza 279): मुदित माथ नावत बनी तुलसी अनाथकी परी रघुनाथ हाथ सही है (Tulsidas bows his head with elation, the orphan has been redeemed, for the signature of Rama's hand has been made [on the Vinaypatrika]).</ref> The 45th stanza of the Vinaypatrika is sung as the evening [[Aarti]] by many Hindus.<ref>Poddar 1997, pp. 64–65.</ref>

===Death===
Tulsidas died at the age of 126 on 31 July 1623 (Shravan month of the year Vikram 1680) in [[Assi Ghat]] on the bank of the river [[Ganges|Ganga]]. Like the year of his birth, traditional accounts and biographers do not agree on the exact date of his death.<ref>Pandey 2008, pp. 58–60: संवत् सोरह सै असी असी गंग के तीर। श्रावण शुक्ला सत्तमी तुलसी तज्यो शरीर॥ quoting Mata Prasad Gupta, and also संवत् सोरह सै असी असी गंग के तीर। श्रावण श्यामा तीज शनि तुलसी तज्यो शरीर॥ quoting the Mula Gosain Charita.</ref><ref>Rambhadracharya 2008, p. xxxiv: संवत् सोरह सै असी असी गंग के तीर। श्रावण शुक्ला तीज शनि तुलसी तज्यो शरीर॥</ref>

==Works==
{{wikisourcelang|1|तुलसीदास|Tulsidas}}
{{Hindu philosophy}}

Twelve works are widely considered by biographers to be written by Tulsidas, six major works and six minor works.<ref name="lutgendorf-rcm"/> Based on the language of the works, they have been classified into two groups as follows–<ref name="pandey-works">Pandey 2008, pp. 54–58</ref>
# '''Awadhi works''' – Ramcharitmanas, Ramlala Nahachhu, Barvai Ramayan, Parvati Mangal, Janaki Mangal and Ramagya Prashna.
# '''[[Braj Bhasha|Braja]] works''' – Krishna Gitavali, Gitavali, Sahitya Ratna, Dohavali, Vairagya Sandipani and Vinaya Patrika.
Besides these twelve works, four more works are popularly believed to be composed by Tulsidas which include Hanuman Chalisa, Hanuman Ashtak, Hanuman Bahuk and Tulsi Satsai.<ref name="pandey-works"/>

Several manuscripts of the Ramcharitmanas are claimed to have been written down by Tulsidas himself. Grierson wrote in the late nineteenth century, two copies of the epic were said to have existed in the poet's own handwriting. One manuscript was kept at [[Rajapur, Uttar Pradesh|Rajapur]], of which only the ''Ayodhyakand'' is left now, which bears marks of water. A legend goes that the manuscript was stolen and thrown into Yamuna river when the thief was being pursued, and only the second book of the epic could be rescued.<ref name="prasad-sgg">Prasad 2008, p. 850, quoting George Grierson.</ref> Grierson wrote that the other copy was at Malihabad in [[Lucknow]] district, of which only one leaf was missing.<ref name="prasad-sgg"/> Another manuscript of the ''Ayodhyakanda'' claimed to be in the poet's own hand exists at Soron in Etah district, one of the places claimed to be Tulsidas' birthplace.

In the work, events take place in the city of Ayodhya, so it is considered to describe the Nahachhu before Upanayana, Vedarambha and Samavartana.<ref>Singh 2005, p. 44.</ref>
# ''Ramajna Prashna'' (रामाज्ञा प्रश्न), literally ''Querying the Will of Rama'', is an Awadhi work related to both Ramayana and [[Jyotisha]] (astrology).

# ''[[Hanuman Chalisa]]'' (हनुमान चालीसा), literally, ''Forty Verses to [[Hanuman]]'', is an Awadhi work of 40 Chaupais and two Dohas in obeisance to Hanuman. Popular belief holds the work to be authored by Tulsidas, and it contains his signature, though some authors do not think the work was written by him.<ref name="lutgen-hc">Lutgendorf 1991, p. 11.</ref> It is one of the most read short religious texts in northern India, and is recited by millions of Hindus on Tuesdays and Saturdays.<ref name="lutgen-hc"/> It is believed to have been uttered by Tulsidas in a state of [[Samadhi]] at the [[Kumbh Mela]] in [[Haridwar]].<ref name="pandey-works"/>
# ''Sankatmochan Hanumanashtak'' (संकटमोचन हनुमानाष्टक), literally ''Eight verses for Hanuman, the Remover of Afflictions'', is an Awadhi work of eight verses in the ''Mattagajendra'' metre, devoted to Hanuman.

<!-- Why is this needed if it is yet unpublished? Gita Press has published all of them.
The entire collection of compositions by Tulsi Das, consisting of 13 books, has been translated into English (as poems) by [[Binda Prasad Khattri]] (1898–1985). The work is, however, yet unpublished.

==Doctrine==
The philosophy and principles of Tulsidas are found across his works, and are especially outlined in the dialogue between Kakbhushundi and [[Garuda]] in the Uttar Kand of the Ramcharitmanas.<ref name="prasad-tulsi-principles">Prasad 2008, pp. xiii–xv.</ref> Tulsidas' doctrine has been described as an assimilation and reconciliation of the diverse tenets and cultures of Hinduism.<ref>Prasad 2008, p. xv: Probably the most marvellous thing about the life of Tulasidasa... is his capacity for assimilating diverse tenets, Vaishnava, Shaiva, Advaita, Sankhya, etc.</ref><ref>Prasad 2008, p. xx: ... the ''Ramacharitamanasa'' interprets the period allegorically and from the Vaishnavite angle of a poet who "attempted to reconcile the Advaita Vedanta point of view with the Ramaite teachings of Ramananda's disciples".</ref><ref>Dwivedi 2008, p. 99: उनका सारा काव्य समन्वय की विराट चेष्टा है। लोक और शास्त्र का समन्वय, गार्हस्थ्य और वैराग्य का समन्वय, भक्ति और ज्ञान का समन्वय, भाषा और संस्कृत का समन्वय, निर्गुण और सगुण का समन्वय, कथा और तत्त्व ज्ञान का समन्वय, ब्राह्मण और चांडाल का समन्वय, पांडित्य और अपांडित्य का समन्वय – रामचरितमानस शुरु से आखिर तक समन्वय का काव्य है।</ref> At the beginning of the Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas says that his work is in accordance with various scriptures – the [[Purana]]s, [[Veda]]s, [[Vedas#Upaveda|Upavedas]], [[Tantra]] and [[Smriti]].<ref>Rambhadracharya 2008, p. 3: नानापुराणनिगमागमसम्मतं ...</ref> Ram Chandra Shukla in his critical work ''Hindi Sahitya Ka Itihaas'' elaborates on Tulsidas' ''Lokmangal'' as the doctrine for social upliftment which made this great poet immortal and comparable to any other world littérateur.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

===Nirguna and Saguna Brahman===

[[File:Ramcharitmanas Verses - II.jpg|thumb|right|Verses from Ramcharitmanas equating the Saguna Brahman and Nirguna Brahman, at the entrance of a temple in [[Bhopal]].|250px]]
As per Tulsidas, the [[Nirguna Brahman]] (quality-less impersonal absolute) and [[Saguna Brahman]] (personal God with qualities) are one and the same. Both, Saguna (qualified Brahman) and Aguna (or Nirguna - unqualified Brahman) are Akath (unspeakable), Agaadh (unfathomable), Anaadi (without beginning, in existence since eternity) and Anupa (without parallel) (अगुन सगुन दुइ ब्रह्म सरूपा। अकथ अगाध अनादि अनूपा॥).<ref>Ramcharitmanas 1.23.1</ref> It is the devotion (Bhakti) of the devotee that forces the Nirguna Brahman which is quality-less, formless, invisible and unborn, to become Saguna Brahman with qualities. Tulsidas gives the example of water, snow and hail to explain this – the substance is the same in all three, but the same formless water solidifies to become hail or a mountain of snow – both of which have a form.<ref>Prasad 2008, pp. 84–85.</ref><ref>Rambhadracharya 2008, p. 149 (Ramcharitmanas 1.116.1–1.116.3): सगुनहि अगुनहि नहिं कछु भेदा। गावहिं मुनि पुरान बुध बेदा॥ अगुन अरूप अलख आज जोई। भगत प्रेम बश सगुन सो होई॥ जो गुन रहित सगुन सोइ कैसे। जल हिम उपल बिलग नहिं जैसे॥.</ref> Tulsidas also gives the simile of a lake – the Nirguna Brahman is like the lake with just water, while the Saguna Brahman is a lake resplendent with blooming lotuses.<ref>Prasad 2008, pp. 520–521.</ref><ref>Rambhadracharya 2008, p. 647 (Ramcharitmanas 4.17.2): फूले कमल सोह सर कैसे। निर्गुन ब्रह्म सगुन भए जैसे॥.</ref> In the Uttar Kand of Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas describes in detail a debate between Kakbhushundi and Lomasa about whether God is Nirguna (as argued by Lomasa adhering to monism) or Saguna (as argued by Kakbhushundi adhering to dualism). Kakbhushundi repeatedly refutes all the arguments of Lomasa, to the point when Lomasa becomes angry and curses Kakbhushundi to be a crow. Lomasa repents later when Kakbhushundi happily accepts the curse but refuses to give up the Bhakti of Rama, the Saguna Brahman.<ref>Prasad 2008, pp. 767–771.</ref><ref>Rambhadracharya 2008, pp. 943–948 (Ramcharitmanas 7.111.1–7.114.7)</ref> Though Tulsidas holds both aspects of God to be equal, he favours the qualified Saguna aspect and the devotees of the highest category in the Ramcharitmanas repeatedly ask for the qualified Saguna aspect of Rama to dwell in their mind.<ref>Dwivedi 2009, p. 132.</ref> Some authors contend from a few couplets in Ramcharitmanas and Vinay Patrika that Tulsidas has vigorously contradicted the denial of Avatar by [[Kabir]].<ref name="singh-tulsi-kabir">Singh 2008, pp. 200–201: उन्होंने उत्तेजित होकर कबीर के मत का ओजस्वी शब्दों में प्रतिकार किया ... कबीर का अवतार विरोधी कथन था ... तुलसी ने "आना" और "अंधा" शब्दों को लक्ष्य करके शिव से मुँहतोड़ उत्तर दिलाया ...</ref> In several of his works, Kabir had said that the actual ''Rama'' is not the son of [[Dasharatha]]. In the Balkand of Ramcharitmanas, Shiva tells Parvati – those who say that the Rama whom the Vedas sing of and whom the sages contemplate on is different from the Rama of Raghu's race are possessed by the devil of delusion and do not know the difference between truth and falsehood.<ref name="singh-tulsi-kabir"/><ref>Prasad 2008, p. 84.</ref> However, such allusions are based on interpretations of the text and do not hold much water when considered in the context of Ramcharitmanas. Tulsidas, in none of his works, has ever mentioned [[Kabir]].

===The name of Rama===

[[File:Ramcharitmanas Verses - III.jpg|thumb|right|Verses from Ramcharitmanas at the beginning of ''Nam-vandana'' (Extolling the name of Rama), at the Manas Mandir, Chitrakoot, India.|250px]]
At the beginning of the Ramcharitmanas, there is a section devoted to the veneration of the name of Rama.<ref>Rambhadracharya 2008, pp. 24–32.</ref> As per Tulsidas, repeating the name of Rama is the only means to attain God in the Kali age where the means suited for other ages like meditation, [[Karma]], and [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]] are ineffective.<ref>Rambhadracharya 2008, pp. 31–32 (Ramcharitmanas 1.27.3, 1.27.7): ध्यान प्रथम जुग मख बिधि दूजे। द्वापर परितोषत प्रभु पूजे॥ ... नहिं कलि करम न भगति बिबेकू। राम नाम अवलंबन एकू॥</ref> He says in Kavitavali that his own redemption is because of the power, glory and majesty of the name of Rama.<ref name="kavitavali-nama"/> In a couplet in the Gitavali, Tulsidas says that wishing for liberation without refuge in the name of Rama is like wishing to climb to the sky by holding on to the falling rain.<ref>Poddar 1996, p. 14 (Dohavali 20): राम नाम अवलंब बिनु परमारथ की आस। बरषत बारिद बूँद गहि चाहत चढ़न अकास॥</ref> In his view, the name of Rama is greater than both Nirguna and Saguna aspects of God – it controls both of them and is illuminates both like a bilingual interpreter.<ref>Rambhadracharya 2008, pp. 27–28 (Ramcharitmanas 1.21.8, 1.23.3): अगुन सगुन बिच नाम सुसाखी। उभय प्रबोधक चतुर दुभाखी॥ ... मोरे मत बड़ नाम दुहूँ ते। किए जेहिं जुग निज बस निज बूते॥</ref> In a verse in the Dohavali, Tulsidas says that the Nirguna Brahman resides in his heart, the Saguna Brahman resides in his eyes and the name of Rama resides on his tongue, as if a radiant gemstone is kept between the lower and upper halves of a golden casket.<ref>Poddar 1996, p. 10–11 (Dohavali 7): हियँ निर्गुन नयननि सगुन रसना राम सुनाम। मनहुँ पुरट संपुट लसत तुलसी ललित ललाम॥</ref> He holds that ''Rama'' is superior to all other names of God,<ref>Rambhadracharya 2008, pp. 623–624 (Ramcharitmanas 3.44.7–3.44): जद्यपि प्रभु के नाम अनेका। श्रुति कह अधिक एक तें एका॥ राम सकल नामन्ह ते अधिका। होउ नाथ अघ खग गन बधिका॥ राका रजनी भगति तव राम नाम सोइ सोम। अपर नाम उडगन बिमल बसहुँ भगत उर ब्योम॥ एवमस्तु मुनि सन कहेउ कृपासिंधु रघुनाथ। तब नारद मन हरष अति प्रभु पद नायउ माथ॥</ref> and argues that ''ra'' and ''ma'' being are the only two consonants that are written above all other consonants in the conjunct form in Sanskrit because they are the two sounds in the word ''Rama''.<ref>Rambhadracharya 2008, p. 26 (Ramcharitmanas 1.20): एक छत्र एक मुकुटमनि सब बरनन पर जोउ। तुलसी रघुबर नाम के बरन बिराजत दोउ॥</ref>

===Rama as Brahman===
At several places in Tulsidas' works, Rama is seen to be the higher than Vishnu and not as an [[avatar]] of Vishnu, which is the general portrayal of Rama.<ref>Prasad 2008, p. 875, quoting Frank Whaling: Theologically, Tulasidasa continues the process, begun in the ''Adhyatma [Ramayana]'', whereby Rama is seen to be higher than Vishnu. We see this in Tulasi's stress upon the Name of Rama; we see it also in Tulasi's assertions that Rama is Brahman whereas Vishnu is not. ... Tulasi uses the word Rama in the sense of God, ... The usual comparison has been between Rama and Christ, but perhaps an apter comparison is between Rama and the Christian God, for in terms of Ramology, Rama is equivalent to God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Bakker| first=Freek L. | isbn=9789004168619 | title = The challenge of the silver screen: an analysis of the cinematic portraits of Jesus, Rama, Buddha and Muhammad: Volume 1 of Studies in religion and the arts | edition=Illustrated | location=Leiden, The Netherlands | year=2009 | publisher=BRILL | page=123 | quote=It is clear that Rama transcends Vishnu in the Manas. He is ''Brahman'' and becomes God in any conceivable form ... It is significant that at the end of Tulsidas' work Rama does not return to his form as Vishnu but continues to rule over Ayodhya.}}</ref><ref name="ubs-tulsi">Singh 2005, p. 180</ref>

In the episode of the delusion of Sati in Ramcharitmanas, Sati sees many a Shiva, Brahma and Vishnu serving Rama and bowing at his feet.<ref>Prasad 2008, p. 45 (Ramcharitmanas 1.45.7–8).</ref> When [[Sraddhadeva Manu|Manu]] and [[Shatarupa]] perform penance, they crave to see that Supreme Lord "from a part of whose being emanate a number of Shivas, Brahmas and Vishnus."<ref name="prasad-manu-shatarupa">Prasad 2008, pp. 102–104.</ref> Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva come to them many times tempting them with a boon, but Manu and Shatarupa do not stop their penance. They are finally satisfied only by the appearance of Rama, on whose left side is Sita, from a part of whom are born "countless Lakshmis, Umas (Parvatis) and Brahmanis (Sarasvatis)."<ref name="prasad-manu-shatarupa"/> In the episode of marriage of Sita and Rama in Balkand, the trio of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva is present – Brahma is astounded as he finds nowhere anything that is his own handiwork, while Vishnu is enchanted with Lakhmi on seeing Rama.<ref>Prasad 2008, pp. 210, 212 (Ramcharitmanas 1.314.8, 1.317.3).</ref> In the [[Sundarkand]], Hanuman tells Ravana that Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva can create, preserve and destroy by the might of Rama.<ref>Prasad 2008, p. 549 (Ramcharitmanas 5.21.3).</ref> In the Lankakand, Tulsidas presents the universe as the cosmic form of Rama, in which Shiva is the consciousness, Brahma is the reason and Vishnu is his intelligence.<ref>Prasad 2008, p. 589 (Ramcharitmanas 6.15 Ka).</ref> As per Tulsidas, Rama is not only an avatar, but also the source of avatars – Krishna is also an Avatar of Rama.<ref>Singh 2008, p. 230: तुलसीदास द्वारा किया गया इतिवृत्त वर्णन तीन कथानायकों पर केन्द्रित है – राम, शिव और कृष्ण। ... राम अवतार मात्र नहीं हैं, वे अवतारी भी हैं। कृष्ण राम के ही अवतार हैं। अतः उनकी अवतार-लीला भी रूपांतर से राम की ही अवतार लीला है।</ref> Thus, Tulsidas clearly considers Rama as supreme brahman and not an avatar of [[Vishnu]].

In the opinion of Urvashi Soorati, the Rama of Tulsidas is an amalgamation of Vishnu who takes [[Dashavatara|avatars]], Vishnu in the abode of Ksheera Sagara, [[Brahman]] and the Para manifestation of the [[Pañcaratra|Pancharatra]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Soorati | first = Urvashi | title = कबीर: जीवन और दर्शन | location=Allahabad, India | language=hi | year=2008 | page=176 |trans-title=Kabir: Life and Philosophy | publisher=Lokbharti Publication | isbn=9788180312397 | quote=ऐसा प्रतीत होता है कि 'उपास्य ब्रह्म राम' अवतार ग्रहण करने वाले विष्णु, क्षीरशायी विष्णु, ब्रह्म और पांचरात्र के 'परविग्रह' – इन सबका समन्वित रूप है।}}</ref> Macfie concludes that Tulsidas makes a "double claim", i.e. Rama is an incarnation of both Vishnu and Brahman.<ref>Macfie 2004, p. 93: The poet's claim is that he is not only an incarnation of Vishnu, the second member of the Triad, but of Brahm, the uncreated, invisible, all-pervading Brahm, the Supreme Spirit of the universe, who has taken on himself a visible form.</ref><ref>Macfie 2004, ''Chapter IX: Rama, the incarnation of Vishnu, and of Brahm, the Supreme God'', pp. 93–160.</ref> In the words of Lutgendorf, Tulsidas' Rama is at once "Valmiki's exemplary prince, the cosmic Vishnu of Puranas, and the transcendent ''brahman'' of the Advaitins."<ref>Lutgendorf 1991, p. 10.</ref>

===Vedanta, World and Maya===

In the Sundarkand of Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas says that Rama is knowable by [[Vedanta]].<ref>Prasad 2008, p. 533.</ref><ref>Rambhadracharya 2008, p. 660</ref>

As per Tulsidas, Rama is the efficient and material cause (''Nimitta'' and ''Upadana'') of the world, which is real since Rama is real.<ref name="singh-jagat">Singh 2008, pp. 272–273.</ref> In several verses of the Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas says that the animate and inanimate world is a manifestation of Rama, and the universe is the cosmic form of Rama. Authors interpret these verses to mean that the world is real according to Tulsidas, in keeping with the [[Vishishtadvaita]] philosophy of [[Ramanuja]].<ref>Shukla 2002, pp. 50–51.</ref><ref>Prasad 2008, pp. 510, 588–589.</ref><ref>Rambhadracharya 2008, p. 632–633, 728–729.</ref> However, at some places in the Ramcharitmanas and Kavitavali, Tulsidas compares the world to a night or a dream and says it is ''Mithya'' (false or unreal). Some commentators interpret these verses to mean that in Tulsidas' opinion the world is unreal as per the ''Vivartavada'' doctrine of [[Adi Shankara]], while some others interpret them to mean that the world is transient yet real as per the ''Satkhyativada'' doctrine of Ramananda.<ref>Prasad 2008, pp. 82, 307, 500.</ref><ref>Rambhadracharya 2008, pp. 101, 377–378, 621.</ref> Uday Bhanu Singh concludes that in Tulsidas' view, the world is essentially the form of Rama and appears to be different from Rama due to [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]. Its visible form is transient, which is what Tulsidas means by ''Mithya''.<ref name="singh-jagat"/>

In the Vinayapatrika, Tulsidas says that the world in itself is neither true (''Satya''), nor false (''Asatya''), nor both true and false together (''Satyasatya'') – one who casts aside all these three illusions, knows oneself. This has been interpreted to mean that as per Tulsidas, the entire world is a [[Lila (Hinduism)|Lila]] of Rama.<ref>Poddar 1997, pp. 144–145 (Stanza 111).</ref> At the beginning of the Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas performs ''Samasti Vandana'' (obeisance to all beings) in which he bows down to the world also, saying it is "pervaded by" or "born out of" Sita and Rama.<ref>Lutgendorf 1991, p. xi.</ref><ref>Prasad 2008, p. 8.</ref><ref>Rambhadracharya 2008, p. 12.</ref> As per some verses in Ramcharitmanas and Vinaypatrika, when a [[Jiva]] (living being) knows the Self, ''Maya'' and Rama, it sees the world as being pervaded by Rama.<ref name="singh-jagat"/>

In the Balkand episode of the marriage of the princes of Ayodhya with the princesses of Mithila, Tulsidas presents a metaphor in which the four brides are compared with the four states of consciousness – the waking state (''Jagrat''), sleep with dreams (''Swapna''), dreamless sleep (''Sushupti'') and the fourth self-conscious state ([[Turiya]]). The four grooms are compared with the presiding divinity (''[[Vibhu]]'') of the four states – ''Vishva'', ''Taijasa'', ''Prajna'' and ''Brahman''. Tulsidas says as the four states of consciousness with their presiding divinities reside in the mind of a Jiva, so the four brides with their grooms are resplendent in the same pavilion.<ref>Prasad 2008, p. 221.</ref><ref>Rambhadracharya 2008, p. 275.</ref>

Tulsidas identifies Maya with Sita, the inseparable energy of Rama which takes avatar along with Rama.<ref name="singh-maya">Singh 2008, p. 272.</ref> In his view, Maya is of two types – Vidya and [[Avidya (Hinduism)|Avidya]]. ''Vidya Maya'' is the cause of creation and the liberation of Jiva. Avidya Maya is the cause of illusion and bondage of the Jiva. The entire world is under the control of Maya.<ref name="singh-maya"/> Maya is essentially the same but the two divisions are made for cognitive purposes, this view of Tulsidas is in accordance with [[Vaishnava]] teachers of Vedanta.<ref name="singh-maya"/>

===Views on other Hindu deities===

As per Tulsidas, there is no incompatibility between devotion to Rama and attachment to Shiva.<ref>Prasad 2008, p. 579 (Ramcharitmanas 6.2): Those who are devoted to Shankara and are hostile to me, and those who are opposed to Shiva but would fain be my servants, shall have their abode in the deepest hell for a full aeon.</ref><ref>Lutgendorf 1991, p. 48: I have noted that a major theme of Tulsi's epic is the compatibility of the worship of Ram/Vishnu with that of Shiva.</ref> Tulsidas equates the Guru as an incarnation of Shiva,<ref name="Prasad 2008, p. 1">Prasad 2008, p. 1</ref> and a considerable part of the Balkand of Ramcharitmanas is devoted to the narrative of Shiva including the abandonment of Sati, the penance of Parvati, the burning of Kamadeva and the marriage of Parvati and Shiva.<ref>Prasad 2008, pp. 40–77 (Ramcharitmanas 1.48–1.104).</ref> In addition, Tulsidas venerates the whole Hindu pantheon. The Ramcharitmanas begins with reverence of Ganesh, Sarasvati, Parvati, Shiva, the Guru, Valmiki and Hanuman.<ref name="Prasad 2008, p. 1"/> At the beginning of the Vinayapatrika, he bows to Ganesh, Surya, Shiva, Devi, Ganga, Yamuna, Varanasi and Chitrakoot, asking them for devotion towards Rama.<ref>Poddar 1997, pp. 1–24 (Stanzas 1–24).</ref>

===Bhakti===
The practical end of all his writings is to inculcate bhakti addressed to Rama as the greatest means of salvation and emancipation from the chain of births and deaths, a salvation which is as free and open to men of the lowest caste as to [[Brahmin]]s.{{sfn|Lyall|1911|p=369}}

==Critical reception==
[[File:Tulsidas stamp.jpg|thumb|right|One anna stamp issued by India Post on Tulsidas|150px]]
From his time, Tulsidas has been acclaimed by Indian and Western scholars alike for his poetry and his impact on the Hindu society. Tulsidas mentions in his work Kavitavali that he was considered a ''great sage'' in the world.<ref name="kavitavali-nama">Indradevnarayan 1996, pp. 100–101 (Quatrain 7.72): राम नाम को प्रभाउ पाउ महिमा प्रताप तुलसी सो जग मनियत महामुनि सों। (It is the power, glory and majesty of the name of Rama due to which the likes of Tulsidas are considered like great sages in the world).</ref> [[Madhusūdana Sarasvatī]], one of the most acclaimed philosophers of the [[Advaita Vedanta]] tradition based in Varanasi and the composer of ''Advaitasiddhi'', was a contemporary of Tulsidas. On reading the Ramcharitmanas, he was astonished and composed the following Sanskrit verse in praise of the epic and the composer.<ref name="rambhadracharya-tulsi-later"/><ref>Shukla 2002, p. 33.</ref>

The Hindi poet [[Mahadevi Verma]] said commenting on Tulsidas that in the turbulent Middle Ages, India got light from Tulsidas. She further went on to say that the Indian society as it exists today is an edifice built by Tulsidas, and the Rama as we know today is the Rama of Tulsidas.<ref>Pandey 2008, p. 11: इस सन्दर्भ में सुप्रसिद्ध कवयित्री महादेवी वर्मा का कथन द्रष्टव्य है – हमारा देश निराशा के गहन अन्धकार में साधक, साहित्यकारों से ही आलोक पाता रहा है। जब तलवारों का पानी उतर गया, शंखों क घोष विलीन हो गया, तब भी तुलसी के कमंडल का पानी नहीं सूखा ... आज भी जो समाज हमारे सामने है वह तुलसीदास का निर्माण है। हम पौराणिक राम को नहीं जानते, तुलसीदास के राम को जानते हैं।</ref>
