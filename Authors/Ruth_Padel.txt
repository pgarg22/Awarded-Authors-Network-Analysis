===Love, journeying, bereavement, creativity===

Padel's 1996 to 2004 collections, ''Fusewire, Rembrandt Would Have Loved You, Voodoo Shop'' and ''The Soho Leopard'', mixed passionate love lyric with wide adventuring across the globe,<ref>https://www.amazon.co.uk/Rembrandt-Would-Loved-Chatto-Poetry/dp/0701167157</ref> but also challenged the supremacy of the male gaze at women. ''Rembrandt Would Have Loved You'' offered the female gaze: "The poems tangle with the shadowy undergrowth of political correctness, feminism and sex."<ref>Maris, Kathryn, [http://poetrylondon.co.uk/curating-slatterns-painting-poetry-and-the-female-gaze-by-kathryn-maris/ "Curating Slatterns: painting, poetry and the female gaze"], ''Poetry London'', 1 June 2018.</ref> ''Emerald'', 2018, a meditation on the consoling nature of green, "guides us around the world, intense flights of geological and geographical fancy anchored to the bedrock of real emotion"; "a wild and generous imagination, a writer at the peak of her powers, a rich excavation of the truths and mysteries found in grief", but also an exploration of the relation between loss and creativity.<ref>http://ambitmagazine.co.uk/reviews/on-ruth-padels-emerald-chatto-windus-2018</ref><ref name=EmeraldPS /><ref>[https://poetrysociety.org.uk/publications-section/the-poetry-review/behind-the-poem/ruth-padel-on-clast/ "Ruth Padel on ‘Clast’: loss, art and creativity"], The Poetry Society.</ref>

==Non-fiction==

===Greek scholarship, Greek myth, rock 'n' roll===

Padel's non-fiction began with [[Princeton University Press]] studies of ancient Greek drama and the mind.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=More by Jasper Griffin |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1993/jun/24/ancient-hearts-on-fire/ |title=Ancient Hearts on Fire|magazine=The New York Review of Books |publisher=Nybooks.com |date=1993-06-24 |access-date=2010-09-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/1995/95.12.22.html |title=Bryn Mawr Classical Review 95.12.22 |publisher=Bmcr.brynmawr.edu |access-date=2010-09-10}}</ref>
''In and Out of the Mind: Greek Images of the Tragic Self'' explores the way Greek ideas of inwardness shaped European notions of the self. She used [[anthropology]] and [[psychoanalysis]] to support her thesis that male Greek culture spoke of the mind as mainly "female" and receptive rather than "male" and active.<ref name="didaskalia1"/> ''Whom Gods Destroy: Elements of Madness in Greek and Other Tragedy'' investigates madness in tragedy from the Greeks to [[Shakespeare]] and the moderns, parsing different views of madness in different societies.<ref name="didaskalia1"/> She presented the tragic hero as embodiment of the human mind, 'which lives catastrophe, suffers damage and endures.'<ref name="didaskalia1">{{cite web|url=http://www.didaskalia.net/issues/vol2no3/padel.html |title=Ancient Theater Today |publisher=Didaskalia |access-date=2010-09-10}}</ref>

Her 2000 study ''I'm A Man: Sex, Gods and Rock 'n' Roll'' argued that [[rock music]] began as a "wishing well of masculinity", which drew on mythic connections between male sexuality, aggression, anxiety, misogyny and violence which derived from [[Ancient Greece]].
