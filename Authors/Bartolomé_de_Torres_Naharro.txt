==Life==
After some years of soldiering and of captivity in [[Algiers]], Torres Naharro took [[Holy Orders|holy orders]], settled in [[Rome]] about 1511, and there devoted himself chiefly to writing plays. Though he alludes to the future pope, [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]], as his protector, he left Rome to enter the household of [[Fabrizio Colonna]] at [[Naples]] as a chaplain<ref>{{Cite CE1913|wstitle=Bartolomé de Torres Naharro}}</ref> where his works were printed under the title of ''Propaladia'' (1517). He is conjectured to have returned to his native place, and to have died there shortly after 1529.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

His ''Diálogo del nacimiento'' is written in unavowed, though obvious, imitation of other [[Leonese language]] writers as [[Juan del Encina]], but in his subsequent plays he shows a much larger conception of dramatic possibilities. He classifies his pieces as ''comedias á noticia'' and ''comedias á fantasía''; the former, of which the ''Soldatesca'' and ''Tinellaria'' are examples, present in dramatic form incidents within his personal experience; the latter, which include such plays as ''Serafina, Himenea, Calamita'' and ''Aquilana'', present imaginary episodes with adroitness and persuasiveness.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

According to an evaluation in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]]:
{{quote|Torres Naharro is much less dexterous in stagecraft than many inferior successors, his humour is rude and boisterous and his diction is unequal; but to a varied knowledge of human nature he adds knowledge of dramatic effect, and his rapid dialogue, his fearless realism and vivacious fancy prepared the way for the [[Romanticism|romantic]] drama in Spain.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} }}

Only one complete copy of the ''Propaladia'' is known to exist. This book was stolen from the [[Royal Danish Library]] in the seventies and was not seen again until it turned up at an auction at [[Christie's]] in 2003 where relatives of the original thief tried to sell it.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}
