'''George MacDonald Fraser''' {{postnom|country=GBR|OBE|FRSL}} (2 April 1925 – 2 January 2008) was a British author and screenwriter. He is best known for a series of works that featured the character [[Harry Paget Flashman|Flashman]].

==Biography==
Fraser was born to Scottish parents in [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], England, on 2 April 1925.<ref name="D Tel (2008)">{{cite news|title=Obituary of George MacDonald Fraser Author who brought new life to Flashman, the cad to end all cads|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=4 January 2008|location=London|page=27}}</ref> His father was a doctor and his mother a nurse.

Fraser was educated at [[Carlisle Grammar School]] and [[Glasgow Academy]];<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/01/03/db0304.xml | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109010859/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/01/03/db0304.xml | url-status=dead | archive-date=9 January 2008 | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=George MacDonald Fraser | date=3 January 2008}}</ref> he later described himself as a poor student due to "sheer laziness".<ref name="Schudel" /> This meant that he was unable to follow his father's wishes and study medicine.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/obituaries/George-MacDonald-Fraser-OBE.3640495.jp|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120731153856/http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/obituaries/George-MacDonald-Fraser-OBE.3640495.jp|url-status=dead|archive-date=31 July 2012|title=Obituary|date=4 January 2008|work=The Scotsman|access-date=19 June 2010}}</ref>

===War service===
In 1943, during World War II, Fraser enlisted in the [[Border Regiment]] and served in the [[Burma campaign]], as recounted in his memoir ''[[Quartered Safe Out Here]]'' (1993). After completing his Officer Cadet Training Unit (OCTU) course, Fraser was granted a commission into the [[Gordon Highlanders]]. He served with them in the Middle East and North Africa immediately after the war, notably in Tripoli. In 1947, Fraser decided against remaining with the army and took up his [[Demobilisation of the British Armed Forces after the Second World War|demobilisation]]. He wrote semi-autobiographical stories and anecdotes of his time with the Gordon Highlanders in the "McAuslan" series.

===Journalism===
After his discharge, Fraser returned to the United Kingdom. Through his father he got a job as a trainee reporter on the ''Carlisle Journal'' and married another journalist, Kathleen Hetherington.<ref name = "PS">{{cite news |first= Pat|last= Sheil |title=Harry Flashman finally buys it: George MacDonald Fraser (1925–2008) |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=4 January 2008 }}</ref> They travelled to Canada, working on newspapers there, before returning to Scotland. Starting in 1953, Fraser worked for many years as a journalist at the ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|Glasgow Herald]]'' newspaper,<ref name = "PS"/> where he was deputy editor from 1964 until 1969. He briefly held the title of acting editor.

===Novelist and screenwriter===
In 1966, Fraser got the idea to turn Flashman, a fictional coward and bully originally created by [[Thomas Hughes]] in ''[[Tom Brown's School Days]]'' (1857), into a hero, and he wrote a novel around the character's exploits. The book proved popular and sale of the film rights enabled Fraser to become a full-time writer. He moved to the [[Isle of Man]] where he could pay less tax.<ref name="tele">[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/what-to-read/captain-in-calico-george-macdonald-fraser-pirate-novel/ Toby Clements, "Flashman flies the Jolly Roger: George MacDonald Fraser's lost pirate novel" ''Daily Telegraph''8 August 2015]</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=FLASHMAN: JOHN O'CALLAGHAN interviews George MacDonald Fraser, creator of Harry Flashman|author=O'Callaghan, John|work=The Guardian|date=22 August 1970|page=6}}</ref>

There was a series of further Flashman novels, presented as packets of memoirs written by the nonagenarian Flashman looking back on his days as a hero of the British Army during the 19th century. The series is notable for the accuracy of its historical settings and praise it received from critics. For example, [[P. G. Wodehouse]] said of ''Flashman'', "If ever there was a time when I felt that '[[On First Looking into Chapman's Homer|watcher-of-the-skies-when-a-new-planet]]' stuff, it was when I read the first Flashman."<ref>{{cite news|last=Hitchens|first= Christopher|title=Farewell to Flashman; The singular creation of George MacDonald Fraser, 1925–2008 |access-date=5 June 2012|newspaper=[[The Weekly Standard]]|date=21 January 2008|author-link=Christopher Hitchens|location=Washington|url= http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/014/579jmzky.asp?p=1}}</ref>

The first ''Flashman'' sequel was ''[[Royal Flash]]''. It was published in 1970, the same year that Fraser published ''The General Danced at Dawn'', a series of short stories which fictionalised his post-war military experience as the adventures of "Dand" MacNeill in a Scottish Highland regiment.

The following year Fraser published a third Flashman, ''[[Flash for Freedom!]]'', as well as a non-fiction work, ''[[The Steel Bonnets]]'' (1971), a history of the Border Reivers of the Anglo-Scottish Border.

The film rights to ''Flashman'' were bought by [[Richard Lester]], who was unable to get the film funded but hired Fraser to write the screenplay for ''[[The Three Musketeers (1973 live-action film)|The Three Musketeers]]'' in Christmas 1972. This would be turned into two films, ''The Three Musketeers'' and ''[[The Four Musketeers (1974 film)|The Four Musketeers]]'', both popular at the box office, and it launched Fraser as a screenwriter.<ref>{{cite news|title=Lester's Back and the 'Musketeers' Have Got Him |author=Shivas, Mark|work=The New York Times |date=  5 August 1973|page= 105}}</ref>

Following ''[[Flashman at the Charge]]'' (1973), Fraser wrote the screenplay for the movie ''[[Royal Flash (film)|Royal Flash]]'' (1975), also directed by Richard Lester. It was not a success at the box office.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Stephen|last=Vagg|magazine=Diabolique|title=Trying to Make a Case for Royal Flash|date=18 May 2020|url=https://diaboliquemagazine.com/trying-to-make-a-case-for-royal-flash/?fbclid=IwAR0fLGRKHXLri_JE_-jlDjSjyGbWCmcD5gKSdWmUoZWDJ_MXRkytyB8MFuQ}}</ref>

There was another collection of Dand McNeill stories, ''McAuslan in the Rough'' (1974), then ''[[Flashman in the Great Game]]'' (1975) and ''[[Flashman's Lady]]'' (1977). He was hired to rewrite ''[[Crossed Swords (1977 film)|Crossed Swords]]'' (1977) and ''[[Force 10 from Navarone (film)|Force 10 from Navarone]]'' (1978). The latter was directed by [[Guy Hamilton]] who arranged for Fraser to do some work on the script for ''Superman'' (1978). He did some uncredited work on the film ''Ashanti'' and wrote an unused script for ''Tai Pan'' to star Steve McQueen. He also wrote a biopic of [[General Stilwell]] for [[Martin Ritt]] which was not filmed.<ref>{{cite news|title=AT THE MOVIES; by tom buckley; brad dourif's long association with 'ragtime.'. |date=7 November 1980|work=New York Times|id={{ProQuest|424015798}}}}</ref>

Fraser tried a more serious historical novel with ''[[Mr American]]'' (1980), although Flashman still appeared in it. ''[[Flashman and the Redskins]]'' (1982) was a traditional Flashman and ''[[The Pyrates]]'' (1983) was a comic novel about pirates. He was one of several writers who worked on the James Bond film ''[[Octopussy]]'' (1983). [[Richard Fleischer]] arranged for him to do work on the script for ''[[Red Sonja (1985 film)|Red Sonja]]'' (1985).

After ''[[Flashman and the Dragon]]'' (1985) he was reunited with Lester on ''[[The Return of the Musketeers]]'' (1988) then released a final volume of McAuslan stories, ''[[The Sheikh and the Dustbin]]'' (1988) and did another history, ''[[The Hollywood History of the World]]'' (1988). When that film book came out he was reportedly working on a science fiction film ''Colossus'' and adapting Conan Doyle's ''The Lost World'' for TV but neither project was filmed.<ref>{{cite news|author=LAWRENCE, V. G.|date=13 August 1988|title=Zipped kilts a rare faux pas in annals of hollywood history|work=The Globe and Mail|id={{ProQuest|385887616}}}}</ref>

Following ''[[Flashman and the Mountain of Light]]'' (1990), Fraser wrote a version of [[The Lone Ranger]] for [[John Landis]] which ended up not being filmed.<ref>{{cite news|author=Buck, J.|date=8 July 1990|title=HBO hoping to build success on a 'Dream'|work=Chicago Tribune|id={{ProQuest|282918118}}}}</ref> He did his memoirs of his experiences during World War II, ''[[Quartered Safe Out Here]]'' (1992).

He wrote a short novel about the [[Border Reivers]] of the 16th century, ''[[The Candlemass Road]]'' (1993), then ''[[Flashman and the Angel of the Lord]]'' (1994) and ''[[Black Ajax]]'' (1997), a novel about [[Tom Molineaux]], which featured Flashman's father as a support character.

''[[Flashman and the Tiger]]'' (1999) consisted of three different Flashman stories. ''[[The Light's on at Signpost]]'' (2002) was a second volume of memoirs, focusing on Fraser's adventures in Hollywood and his criticisms of modern-day Britain. The latter could also be found in ''[[Flashman on the March]]'' (2005), the final Flashman, and ''[[The Reavers]]'' (2007), a comic novel about the Border Reivers in the style of ''The Pyrates''.

Following his death a novel was discovered amongst his papers, ''[[Captain in Calico]]''. This was published in 2015.

==Honours==
Fraser was appointed [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the [[1999 Birthday Honours]] for services to literature.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=55513 |date=12 June 1999 |page=11 |supp=y}}</ref> A traditionalist, he was an Honorary Member of the [[British Weights and Measures Association]], which opposes compulsory conversion to the metric system.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bwmaonline.com/Hon%20members.htm|title=Patrons and Honorary members|work=British Weights and Measures Association|access-date=5 June 2012}}</ref>

==Family==
Fraser married Kathleen Hetherington in 1949. They had three children, Simon, [[Caro Fraser|Caroline]], and Nicholas. He had eight grandchildren. He survived a heart attack in 1999.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

Some of the stories were originally [[byline]]d "by Dand MacNeill", a play on the regimental motto BYDAND,<ref>An adjectival use of the [[Middle Scots]] present participle of ''bide'' [http://www.dsl.ac.uk/getent4.php?query=bydand&sset=1&fset=20&printset=20&searchtype=full&dregion=form&dtext=snd (SND: Bydand)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117183110/http://www.dsl.ac.uk/getent4.php?query=bydand&sset=1&fset=20&printset=20&searchtype=full&dregion=form&dtext=snd |date=17 January 2012 }}</ref> meaning standfast:
