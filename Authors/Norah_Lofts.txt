'''Norah Lofts''', ''n√©e'' '''Norah Ethel Robinson''', (27 August 1904{{spaced ndash}}10 September 1983) was a 20th-century [[best-selling]] British author. She also wrote under the [[pen name]]s '''Peter Curtis''' and '''Juliet Astley'''. She wrote more than fifty books specialising in [[historical fiction]], but she also wrote some mysteries and non-fiction and short stories. Many of her novels, including her Suffolk Trilogy, follow the history of  specific houses and their residents over several generations.

Norah Ethel Robinson was born in [[Shipdham]], [[Norfolk]] to Isaac Robinson and Ethel Garner, and grew up in [[Bury St Edmunds]] where was educated at Guildhall Feoffment Girls School and the [[County Upper School|County Grammar School for Girls]] in the town.

==Work==
Lofts chose to release her murder-mystery novels under the pen name Peter Curtis because she did not want the readers of her historic fiction to pick up a murder-mystery novel and expect classic Lofts historical fiction. However, the murders still show characteristic Lofts elements. Most of her historical novels fall into two general categories: [[biographical novel]]s about queens, among them [[Anne Boleyn]], [[Isabella I of Castile]], and [[Catherine of Aragon]]; and novels set in [[East Anglia]] centered around the fictitious town of Baildon (patterned largely on Bury St. Edmunds). Her creation of this fictitious area of England is reminiscent of [[Thomas Hardy]]'s creation of "[[Thomas Hardy's Wessex|Wessex]]"; and her use of recurring characters such that the protagonist of one novel appears as a secondary character in others is even more reminiscent of [[William Faulkner]]'s work set in "[[Yoknapatawpha County]]," Mississippi. Lofts' work set in East Anglia in the 1930s and 1940s shows great concern with the very poor in society and their inability to change their conditions. Her approach suggests an interest in the social reformism that became a feature of British post-war society.

She was not afraid to tackle potentially sensitive subjects; her version of the [[Nativity of Jesus]], with backstories of Mary, Joseph, the Magi, the shepherds - even the innkeeper - is rendered in ''How Far To Bethlehem?'' as is the ill-fated [[Donner Party]]  expedition in ''Road to Revelation'' (aka ''Winter Harvest'').

Several of her novels were turned into films. ''Jassy'' was filmed as ''[[Jassy (film)|Jassy]]'' (1947) starring [[Margaret Lockwood]] and [[Dennis Price]]. ''You're Best Alone'' was filmed as ''[[Guilt Is My Shadow]]'' (1950). ''The Devil's Own'' (also known as ''The Little Wax Doll'' and ''Catch As Catch Can'') was filmed as ''[[The Witches (1966 film)|The Witches]]'' (1966). The film ''[[7 Women]]'' (1966) was directed by John Ford and very loosely based on the story "Chinese Finale" by Norah Lofts.
Her books still have a devoted international readership, notably on the [[Goodreads]] website.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/195727.Norah_Lofts | title=Norah Lofts | publisher=Goodreads | accessdate=August 19, 2018}}</ref>

==Honours==
In the United States, she won a [[List of National Book Award winners#1935 to 1941|National Book Award]] for ''I Met a Gypsy'', voted by members of the [[American Booksellers Association]]. Specifically, her collection was "the 'forgotten book' of the year [1936] that least deserved to be forgotten" (subsequently termed the Bookseller Discovery). [[Alfred A. Knopf, Sr.|Alfred Knopf]] represented her at the ceremony.<ref name=nyt1937>
