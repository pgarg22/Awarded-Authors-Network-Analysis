'''Sir Henry Taylor''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|KCMG}} (18 October 1800 &ndash; 27 March 1886) was an English [[dramatist]] and poet, Colonial Office official, and man of letters.

==Early life==
Henry Taylor was born on 18 October 1800 in [[Bishop Middleham]]. He was the third son of George Taylor Snr and Eleanor Ashworth, who died when he was an infant.<ref name="DNB">{{cite DNB|wstitle=Taylor, Henry (1800-1886)}}</ref> His father remarried Jane Mills in 1818, and the family then moved to [[Witton-le-Wear]].<ref name="ODNB">{{ODNBweb|id=27030|title=Taylor, Henry|first=Mark|last=Reger}}</ref> George Taylor Snr's friend [[Charles Arbuthnot]] found vocational positions in London for Henry Taylor and his elder brother, George Taylor Jnr. In 1817, the pair along with their second brother, William, a medical student, went to London. Soon afterwards, all three siblings contracted [[typhus fever]], and both his brothers died within a fortnight.<ref name="DNB"/> 

Following this tragedy, Henry Taylor then accepted work in the Colonial administration of [[Barbados]].<ref name="ODNB" /> Taylor's place in Barbados was abolished in 1820, subsequent to which he returned to his father's house.

==At the Colonial Office==
Taylor obtained a clerkship in the [[Colonial Office]], where he subsequently worked from 1824 until 1872, through [[Sir Henry Holland, 1st Baronet|Henry Holland]]. In this position Taylor served under the permanent secretary [[Robert William Hay]].<ref name="DNB"/><ref>{{ODNBweb|id=58175|title=Hay, Robert William|first=John D.|last=Blackwell}}</ref> Taylor was appointed a Knight Commander of the [[Order of St Michael and St George]] (KCMG) in the [[1869 Birthday Honours]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=23512 |page=3750 |date=1 July 1869 }}</ref>

Hay's successors included [[James Stephen (civil servant)|James Stephen]], [[Herman Merivale]] and [[Frederic Rogers]]. Hay, Stephen, Taylor and [[James Spedding]], who also worked in the Office, each proposed reform.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gillian Sutherland|title=Studies in the Growth of Nineteenth-century Government|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6489AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA146|access-date=16 December 2012|year=1972|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|isbn=978-0-7100-7170-5|page=146}}</ref> During the 1830s, Taylor and Stephen endorsed the abolitionist contentions of [[Henry Grey, 3rd Earl Grey|Viscount Howick]], as a consequence of which Stephen replaced Hay.<ref>{{cite book|author=Galbrath, John S|title=Reluctant Empire: British Policy on the South African Frontier, 1834-1854|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w9TmJBYHWlAC&pg=PA12|access-date=16 December 2012|year=1963|publisher=University of California Press|pages=12–3|id=GGKEY:1HK80QN8SKK}}</ref>

Taylor died on 27 March 1886.<ref name="ODNB"/>

Taylor wrote Byronic poems and an article on [[Thomas Moore]], which in 1822 was accepted for the ''[[Quarterly Review]]'' by [[William Gifford]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Taylor | first = Henry | title = 654: Article 6.

His father George was a friend of [[William Wordsworth]]. In 1823, on a visit to the [[Lake District]], Henry Taylor made the acquaintance of [[Robert Southey]], and they became friends.<ref name="DNB"/> Jane Taylor had a first cousin, [[Isabella Fenwick]] (1783–1856), whom he introduced to the Wordsworth family. She became a close friend of Wordsworth in later life, as she had been of Taylor up to the time of his marriage.<ref>{{cite book|author1=William Wordsworth|author2=Jared R.

In his autobiography, Henry Taylor wrote, “There is a good deal of her mind in my writings. I wish there was more; and I wish that she had left her thoughts behind her in writings of her own.”<ref>{{Cite book|last=Taylor|first=Henry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gxdHAAAAYAAJ&q=autobiography+of+henry+taylor|title=Autobiography of Henry Taylor, Volume I|publisher=Longmans, Green|year=1885|location=London|pages=54}}</ref>

Taylor's work also brought him literary friends: the circle of [[Thomas Hyde Villiers]], and his colleague [[James Stephen (civil servant)|James Stephen]].<ref>{{ODNBweb|id=28303|title=Villiers, Thomas Hyde|first=H.

Taylor aspired to become the official biographer of Southey. The family row over Southey's second marriage, to [[Caroline Anne Bowles]], found him with the Wordsworths and others hostile to Bowles.<ref>{{cite book|author=Lynda Pratt|title=Robert Southey and the Contexts of English Romanticism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GfmepWeuW_kC&pg=PA224|access-date=16 December 2012|year=2006|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-3046-3|pages=223–4}}</ref> He did become Southey's [[literary executor]].<ref name="Seville1999">{{cite book|author=Catherine Seville|title=Literary Copyright Reform in Early Victorian England: The Framing of the 1842 Copyright Act|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_n4suaopVXsC&pg=PA182|access-date=16 December 2012|date=20 September 1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-62175-5|page=182}}</ref>

==Works==
In Witton, Taylor wrote ''The Cave of Ceada'' which was accepted for the ''[[Quarterly Review]]''.  Taylor wrote a number of plays, including ''Isaac Comnenus'' (1827),<ref>{{cite book | last = Taylor | first = Henry | title = Isaac Comnenus | url = https://archive.org/details/isaaccomnenusap00taylgoog | publisher = John Murray | location = London | year = 1827 | oclc = 707078180 }}</ref> ''and Philip van Artevelde'' (1834).<ref>{{cite book | last = Taylor | first = Henry | title = Philip van Artevelde | publisher = Boston, Ticknor and Fields | location = London | year = 1863 | oclc = 405182 }}</ref> This latter brought him fame and elicited comparisons with Shakespeare. In 1845 there followed a book of lyrical poems. His essay ''The Statesman'' (1836) caused some controversy, as a "supposedly" satirical view of how the civil service worked.<ref>{{cite book | last = Taylor | first = Henry |editor-last= Schaefer |editor-first= David Lewis|editor2-last= Schaefer |editor2-first= Roberta R.| title = The statesman | publisher = Praeger | location = Westport, Connecticut | year = 1992 | orig-year = 1836 | isbn = 9780275944032 }}</ref>

Taylor published his ''Autobiography'' in 1885, which contains portraits of Wordsworth, Southey, [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]] and [[Walter Scott]]. In it, on his own account, he gave [[Richard Whately]]'s opinion of him as a "resuscitated Bacon", who had better things to do than write verse (which could be left to women).<ref>* {{cite book | last = Taylor | first = Henry | title = Autobiography of Henry Taylor, 1800-1875, Volume 2: 1844-1875 | page = 66 | publisher = Longmans, Green | location = London | year = 1885 | oclc = 277228504 }} [https://archive.org/stream/autobiographyhe01taylgoog#page/n180/mode/2up archive.org.]</ref>

His poem ''Edwin the Fair''<ref>{{cite book | last = Taylor | first = Henry | title = Edwin the Fair | url = https://archive.org/details/edwinfairanhist04taylgoog | publisher = John Murray | location = London | year = 1842 | oclc = 4790134 }}</ref> depicted [[Charles Elliot]] as Earl Athulf.<ref>{{ODNBweb|id=8656|title=Elliot, Charles|first=Andrew|last=Lambert}}</ref> [[Thomas Frederick Elliot]], Charles's brother, was a Colonial Office colleague.<ref name="DNB"/>

==Literary reputation==
In his own time, Taylor was highly esteemed as a poet and dramatist.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Patmore|first1=Coventry|title=The Modern English Drama|journal=North British Review|date=1858|volume=29|pages=134–35}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=De Vere|first1=Aubrey|title=Mr. Henry Taylor's Late Plays and Minor Poems|journal=North British Review|date=1865|volume=43|pages=385–424}}</ref>  For example, J.G. Lockhart claimed that ''Philip Van Artevelde'' secured Taylor "a place among the real artists of his time",<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lockhart|first1=J.G.|title=Philip Van Artevelde|journal=Quarterly Review|date=1834|volume=51|page=391}}</ref> and, as late as 1868, J.H. Stirling ranked ''Philip'' higher than anything produced by [[Robert Browning]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Stirling|first1=J.H.|title=The Poetical Works of Robert Browning|journal=North British Review|date=1868|volume=49|page=387}}</ref>

Modern literary historians, however, tend to overlook Taylor's accomplishments in verse and drama and emphasize his importance as a literary critic, pointing out that he was a strong advocate for stylistic simplicity, subject matter rooted in common life, and intellectual discipline in poetic composition, placing special importance on clear and reasoned structure.<ref name="poston">{{cite journal|last1=Poston|first1=Lawrence|title=Wordsworth among the Victorians: The Case of Sir Henry Taylor|journal=Studies in Romanticism|date=1978|volume=17|issue=3|pages=293–305|doi=10.2307/25600139|jstor=25600139|url=http://www.austinlibrary.com:2138/stable/25600139?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=Sir&searchText=Henry&searchText=Taylor&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3DSir%2BHenry%2BTaylor%26amp%3Bacc%3Don%26amp%3Bwc%3Don%26amp%3Bfc%3Doff%26amp%3Bgroup%3Dnone&seq=6#page_scan_tab_contents|access-date=23 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=R.G.|title=Victorian Criticism of Poetry: The Minority Tradition|journal=Scrutiny|date=1951|volume=18|page=16}}</ref>

==Marriage and family==
Taylor married Hon. Theodosia Alice Spring Rice, daughter of [[Thomas Spring Rice, 1st Baron Monteagle of Brandon]], on 17 October 1839. They had five children, including the biographer [[Ida Alice Ashworth Taylor]].<ref name="ODNB"/><ref name="Wyatt1995"/>
