'''Kevin Andrews''' (1924–1989) was an American [[philhellenism|philhellene]], writer and [[archaeologist]].

==Early life and education==
Roy Kevin Andrews was born a U.S. citizen in [[Beijing|Peking]]. His mother was [[Yvette Borup Andrews]], but there is controversy over the name of his father. Yvette was married to [[Roy Chapman Andrews]] at the time of Kevin's birth, but the first man to visit her to see the newborn son was not Roy Chapman Andrews, but [[Harold St Clair (Chips) Smallwood]]. On the eve of Kevin's marriage, nearly 30 years later, Yvette announced to Kevin that Smallwood, and not Roy Chapman Andrews, was his father. This was to have a fundamental and shattering effect on Kevin who constantly and incessantly obsessed on his own identity.{{Citation needed|date=March 2021}}

His mother's ancestors included [[George A. Brandreth]], [[Aaron Ward (representative)|Aaron Ward]], and [[Elkanah Watson]], all prominent in New York business and politics. Kevin Andrews was schooled in [[England]] at [[Stowe School|Stowe]], where he learned [[Ancient Greek language|classical Greek]]. He served for three years as a private in the [[United States Army|US Army]] seeing action in [[Italy]]. After graduating from [[Harvard]] in 1947 he entered for a travelling fellowship in [[Athens]], and his future life in [[Greece]] was decided by chance when he was successful; as he said "the award ... was fortuitous since no one else applied for it, and is relevant only as the reason why I went to Greece in the first place."

==Arrival in Greece==
After a month spent on [[Paros]] helping Greek-American friends with the grape-harvest, Andrews arrived in the autumn of 1947 at the [[American School of Classical Studies at Athens]]. It was a time of [[civil war]], the rate of inflation was high and the Greek people were suffering extreme hardship. He was unfortunate and suffered from an "obscure nervous disorder", which turned out to be epilepsy, and spent much of his first winter in a miserable draughty room. Travel on the mainland was severely restricted; a permit was needed to travel more than a few miles from Athens. It could also be dangerous. A few days after the students had visited [[Mycenae]], [[Kenneth Matthews (writer)|Kenneth Matthews]], an English journalist, was kidnapped there. Some travelers were unlucky and [[George Polk]], a US reporter, was captured in the mountains and his body was washed up soon afterwards near [[Salonika]]. After a disappointing stay in Greece, Andrews was preparing to leave when he was offered a [[Fulbright Fellowship]] to stay and carry out a study of the castles and fortifications built by various invaders in the [[Peloponnese]]. This offered a field unresearched by others and the freedom to travel alone, and so he accepted with delight.<ref name=Andrews1959b>Andrews, Kevin, (1959), ''The Flight of Ikaros: a journey into Greece'', pp23-25.</ref>

==Traveler in the Peloponnese==
Andrews spent the long summers of 1948 to 1951 travelling around the Peloponnese, the winters writing up in Athens. His journeys and the people he met are described vividly in ''The Flight of Ikaros'' (published 1959, reissued 1969 and 1984), "one of the great and lasting books about Greece."<ref name=Fermor1959>Leigh Fermor, Patrick, in Andrews, Kevin, (1959), ''The Flight of Ikaros: a journey into Greece'' (Penguin edition), cover notes.</ref> As this overlapped with the [[Greek Civil War]] and its aftermath, it was a time of mistrust, particularly of foreigners (and especially of one making plans and notes in the hills), but he soon gained the trust of country people on both sides of the conflict. He became friends with a shepherd in the [[Geraneia]] (Γεράνεια) hills and become his child's ''koumbaros'' or member of the family and godfather. His time in Greece closed with an ascent of [[Mount Olympus]], described in the book, the first by a westerner since the outbreak of the civil war. The fruit of his work, ''Castles of the Morea'', was published in 1953 (reissued 2006).

He returned to the US only to feel an exile, after failing to get a job connected with US aid in Greece. Greece was in the process of reconstruction and the domestic politics were dominated by America, left-wing politics was banned and many activists were shot or placed in camps. During this period he met Nancy Thayer, [[E.E. Cummings]]'s daughter, who was married to Andrews's friend Willard Roosevelt at the time. Andrews married Nancy in 1954 and the next year moved to Europe with her first two children, eventually settling in Athens. The couple later had two children of their own, Ioanna and Alexis. In 1968, the couple separated, and she and her children moved to London because, according to Andrews's biographer Roger Jinkinson,<ref name="AmericanIkaros">[http://www.tales-from-a-greek-island.com/BLOGpage.cfm?blogno=6818903 Jinkinson, Roger - ''American Ikaros'' (biography)] (published 2010)</ref> "she did not want to live under the Junta nor have her children brought up in a police state"; she kept the name Nancy T. Andrews and hoped they could someday reconcile.<ref>Webster, Michael P., "[http://www.gvsu.edu/english/cummings/memorial14.pdf A Memorial: Nancy T. Andrews, Daughter of E. E. Cummings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609182244/http://www.gvsu.edu/english/cummings/memorial14.pdf |date=2011-06-09 }}," ''Spring'' 14-15 (2005-2006): 260-268.</ref>

==Later writing==
Back in Greece Kevin Andrews's next publication ''Athens'' was published in 1967. It was a counterblast against a westernized Greece which had been sanitized for the tourist. Protest had to be guarded and he waited until the departure of the [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974|Junta]] in 1974 before plain writing about political matters was possible. Writings in this period included an essay on [[Louis MacNeice]] and a lengthy autobiographical poem published in book form, called ''First Will and Testament''. In 1975 he [[relinquishment of United States nationality|relinquished his US citizenship]] and became nationalized as a Greek. ''Athens Alive'' followed in 1980, it is a book of writings about Athens from [[Ovid]] in AD 7 to [[Cavafy]] and [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]] in the 20th century.<ref name=Fermor1980>Leigh Fermor, Patrick, (1980), ''Interfering in Greece: review of Athens Alive'' in ''Words of Mercury'' pp. 234-245.</ref>

In 1988, Andrews met Elizabeth Boleman-Herring in Athens. In the late summer of 1989 they traveled to [[Kythira]], an island off the southern tip of the Peloponnese. On September 1, they walked to [[Cape Trachylos]] at the southern end of the island, Andrews started a swim to [[Avgo]] (Αυγό), a rocky island, the reputed birthplace of [[Aphrodite]]. He drowned and his body was recovered the next day.<ref>[http://www.sousveillance.org/journal/?p=83 Sousveillance Blog] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311135833/http://www.sousveillance.org/journal/?p=83 |date=2007-03-11 }} retrieved September 2006 (this URL is not stable).</ref>
