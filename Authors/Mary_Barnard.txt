Barnard was mentored via airmail from Italy by [[Ezra Pound]] after she sent him six poems, and was introduced to the likes of [[William Carlos Williams]] and [[Marianne Moore]].<ref name="poundenc">{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ttMlqGMYCsIC&pg=PA19|title=The Ezra Pound Encyclopedia|chapter=Barnard, Mary|page=19|last=George|first=Anita|isbn=9780313304484|year=2005}}</ref> This generated a lifetime of lengthy correspondence with the former in addition to comprehensive instruction on the art of poetry from Pound. Pound encouraged Barnard to use translations to hone her poetic abilities.<ref name="poundenc"/> Pound also encouraged Barnard to visit Europe, meet [[Hilda Doolittle|H.D.]] (which did not happen despite pressure from Pound), and generally witness the continental European scene.

She returned to Vancouver after fifteen years on the East Coast and continued to write, mostly original poetry and prose, until her death.{{sfn|Barnsley|2013|p=xvi}}
