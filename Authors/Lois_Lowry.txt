'''Lois Ann Lowry''' (née '''Hammersberg'''; March 20, 1937) is an American writer. She is the author of several books for children and young adults, including ''[[The Giver Quartet]],'' ''[[Number the Stars]]'', and ''[[Rabble Starkey]].'' She is known for writing about difficult subject matters, dystopias, and complex themes in works for young audiences.

Lowry has won two [[Newbery Medal]]s: for ''[[Number the Stars]]'' in 1990 and ''[[The Giver]]'' in 1994.  Her book ''[[Gooney Bird Greene]]'' won the 2002 Rhode Island Children's Book Award.

Many of her books have been challenged or even banned in some schools and libraries, including the first book of The Giver Quartet, [[The Giver|The Giver (1993)]] which is considered mandatory curriculum in some schools while being prohibited in others.

==Writing career==
[[File:Lois lowry 0001.jpg|thumbnail|left|Lois Lowry at an event for the [[The Giver (film)|film adaption of ''The Giver'']] in 2014]]

Lowry first began her career as a freelance journalist. In the 1970s, she submitted a short story to ''[[Redbook]]'' magazine, which was intended for adult audiences but written from a child's perspective.<ref name="pabook2021" /> An editor working at [[Houghton Mifflin]] then suggested to Lowry that she should write a children's book.<ref name="pabook2021" /> Lowry agreed and wrote her first book ''[[A Summer to Die]],'' which was later published by Houghton Mifflin in 1977 when she was 40 years old.<ref name="pabook2021" /> The book featured the theme of [[terminal illness]], which is based on Lowry's own experiences with her sister Helen.<ref name="pabook2021" />

Lowry continued to write about difficult topics in her next publication, ''[[Autumn Street]]'' (1979), which explores themes of coping with [[racism]], [[grief]], and [[fear]] at a young age.<ref name="pabook2021" /> The novel is told from the perspective of a young girl who is sent to live with her grandfather during [[World War II]], which is also based on her own experiences of having her father deployed during World War II. Of all the books she has published, ''Autumn Street'' is considered to be her most autobiographical.<ref name="pabook2021" /><ref name="Biography" />

In the same year of publishing ''Autumn Street'', Lowry also published her novel ''[[Anastasia Krupnik]]'', the first instalment in the Anastasia series.<ref name="Biography" /> The series, which touches on serious themes with a humorous approach,<ref name="pabook2021" /> continued through to 1995.

Lowry published ''[[Number the Stars]]'' in 1989, which book received multiple awards, including the 1990 [[Newbery Medal|Newbery medal]].<ref name="newbery" /> Lowry received another Newbery medal in 1994, for ''[[The Giver]]'' (1993).<ref name="newbery" /> After publishing ''[[The Giver]]'', she went on to publish another three companion novels which take place in the same universe: ''[[Gathering Blue]]'' (2000) and ''[[Messenger (novel)|Messenger]]'' (2004) and finally ''[[Son (novel)|Son]]'' (2012), which tied all three of the previous books together. Collectively, they are referred to as ''[[The Giver Quartet]]''.<ref name="Biography" /> The ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' described the quartet as "less a speculative fiction than a kind of guide for teaching children (and their parents, if they're listening carefully) how to be a good person."<ref name="koisNYT3oct2012" />

In early 2020, she released a book of poetry, called ''[[On the Horizon (Lowry book)|On the Horizon]]'', charting her childhood memories of life in Hawaii and Tokyo, and the lives lost during the attack on Pearl Harbor and the bombing of Hiroshima.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=The Giver: Interview with Lois Lowry|url=https://mythaxis.com/2020/08/01/the-giver-interview-with-lois-lowry/|url-status=live|website=Mythaxis Review}}</ref>

During the coronavirus epidemic in 2020, the American publishing company [[Scholastic Corporation]] asked Lowry to write a new introduction to ''Like the Willow Tree'', a story of a young girl living in Portland, Maine who was orphaned during the 1918 [[Spanish flu epidemic|Spanish Flu epidemic]].

===Critical reception and banning===
Throughout her works, Lowry has explored several complex issues including [[racism]], [[terminal illness]], [[murder]], [[the Holocaust]], and the questioning of [[authority]], among other challenging topics. Her writing on such matters has accumulated both praise and criticism.<ref name="hatcherCNN2000">{{Cite web|last=Hatcher|first=Thurston|date=26 September 2000|title=Book challenges drop, but librarians, writers remain wary|url=https://www.cnn.com/2000/books/news/09/26/banned.books/index.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210125121116/http://www.cnn.com/2000/books/news/09/26/banned.books/index.html|archive-date=January 25, 2021|access-date=2021-02-07|website=[[CNN]]}}</ref> The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' has said a theme running through all of her work is "the importance of human connections."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Isaacson|first=Noah|date=19 October 2003|title=Lois Lowry remains true to her readers|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2003-10-19-0310190122-story.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210207180112/https://www.chicagotribune.com/|archive-date=February 7, 2021|access-date=2021-02-07|website=[[Chicago Tribune]]|language=en-US}}</ref>

By 2000, eight of her books had been challenged in schools and libraries in the United States.<ref name="hatcherCNN2000" /> In particular, ''[[The Giver]]'' (the first novel in The Giver Quartet) received a diversity of reactions from [[American schools|schools in America]] after its release in 1993.

According to biographer Joel Chaston, Lowry's most critically acclaimed works are ''Rabble Starkey'', ''Number the Stars'', and ''The Giver''.<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|x}}

== Impact ==
Biographer Joel Chaston described her as "clearly one of the most important twentieth-century American writers for children".<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|ix}}

Robin Wasserman, a writer for [[The New York Times|''The'' ''New York Times'']], said "In many ways, Lowry invented the contemporary young adult dystopian novel", pointing out that in 1993 it was "unusual and unsettling" for children's literature to address topics of political oppression, euthanasia, suicide, or murder.<ref name="wassermanNYT11oct2012" />

== Awards ==
Lowry won the [[Newbery Medal]] in 1990 for her novel ''[[Number the Stars]]'', and again in 1994 for ''[[The Giver]]''.<ref name=newbery/> For ''[[Number the Stars]]'', Lowry has also received the [[National Jewish Book Award]] in 1990, in the Children's Literature category,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jewishbookcouncil.org/awards/national-jewish-book-awards/past-winners|title=Past Winners|website=Jewish Book Council|language=en|access-date=2020-01-19|archive-date=March 8, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200308182757/https://www.jewishbookcouncil.org/awards/national-jewish-book-awards/past-winners|url-status=live}}</ref> and the [[Dorothy Canfield Fisher Children's Book Award]] in 1991.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=2005-08-01|title=Newbury Award winner Lois Lowry to speak at Bates|url=https://www.bates.edu/news/2005/08/01/newbury-award/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601173855/https://www.bates.edu/news/2005/08/01/newbury-award/|archive-date=June 1, 2015|access-date=2021-02-07|website=News|language=en}}</ref>

The citation observed that "''The Giver'' was one of the most frequently challenged books from 1990 to 2000" — that is, the object of "a formal, written attempt to remove a book from a library or classroom." According to the panel chair, "The book has held a unique position in teen literature. Lowry's exceptional use of metaphors and subtle complexity make it a book that will be discussed, debated and challenged for years to come...a perfect teen read."<ref name=edwards/>

She's also won a [[Boston Globe–Horn Book Award|Boston Globe-Hornbook Award]], an [[Anne V. Zarrow Award for Young Readers' Literature|Anne V. Zarrow Award]], a [[Golden Kite Award]], and a Hope S. Dean Memorial Award.<ref name="pabook2021" />

== Notes ==
{{notelist |notes=
{{efn |name=giver |1=
With the release of ''[[Son (novel)|Son]]'' (2012), the ''Giver'' series has been redefined as a finished "quartet" of fantasy novels. While ''[[Gathering Blue]]'' (2000) and ''[[Messenger (novel)|Messenger]]'' (2004) were only loosely related companions to ''[[The Giver]]'' (1993), ''Son'' ties all three storylines together, with "heroes and fates colliding in a final, epic struggle."<br/>
