'''Mehmet Arif Onat Kutlar''' (25 January 1936 &ndash; 11 January 1995), also known as '''Onat Kutlar''', was a prominent [[Turkish people|Turkish]] writer and poet, founder of the Turkish Sinematek and one of the founders of the [[Istanbul International Film Festival]].

==Biography==
Onat Kutlar was born in [[Alanya]], [[Turkey]] in 1936. He was the grandson of Arif Pasha, an Ottoman governor of the [[Taif]] district and the son of Ali Riza Bey, a penal judge of the young Turkish Republic and later a farmer, and Meliha Hanim.

He grew up in the city of [[Gaziantep]]. He studied law at [[Istanbul University]] and philosophy in [[Paris]]. His book, ''Ishak'' (1959), composed of nine short stories, most of which are written from the point of view of a child and are often [[surrealist]]ic and [[mysticism|mystic]]al was the recipient of the 1960 "Turkish Language Association Short Story Award". According to the literary critic Fethi Naci, these represent a very early example of [[magical realism]] genre. In 1985, he was a member of the jury at the [[35th Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name="Berlinale 1985">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1985/04_jury_1985/04_Jury_1985.html |title=Berlinale: Juries |access-date=2011-01-08 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref> In 1994, he was awarded with [[L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] and in 1975 Cultural Medal of Poland for his work in the Turkish Sinematek.

He died on 11 January 1995 in [[Istanbul]] resulting from injuries sustained in bomb attack (carried out by the terror organization [[Kurdistan Workers' Party|PKK]]) which occurred on 30 December 1994 at The Marmara Hotel's cafeteria in [[Taksim Square|Taksim]]. He was laid to rest at the [[Aşiyan Asri Cemetery]].

Currently, the [[FIPRESCI|International Federation of Film Critics]] (FIPRESCI) Prize in the National Competition of the [[Istanbul International Film Festival]] is named after him to commemorate his contributions to the [[Turkish cinema]].
