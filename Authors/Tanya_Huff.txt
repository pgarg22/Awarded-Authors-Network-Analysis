==Biography==
Born in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], Huff was raised in [[Kingston, Ontario]]. Her first sale as a writer was to ''[[The Picton Gazette]]'' when she was ten.<ref name=tart>{{cite web|author=Dani Fletcher |url=http://www.sequentialtart.com/archive/jan01/huff.shtml |title=Tanya Huff – Blood and Valor (vol IV/iss 1/January 2001) |publisher=Sequential Tart |access-date=2012-11-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.challengingdestiny.com/interviews/huff.htm |title=Wizards, Vampires & a Cat: From the Imagination of Tanya Huff |publisher=Challengingdestiny.com |date=19 August 1998 |access-date=2012-11-30 |last1=Switzer |last2=Schellenberg |first1=David M. |first2=James}}</ref> They paid $10 for two of her poems. Huff joined the [[Canadian Naval Reserve]] in 1975 as a cook, ending her service in 1979. In 1982 she received a [[Bachelor of Applied Arts]] degree in [[Radio and Television Arts]] from [[Ryerson Polytechnical Institute]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]; she was in the same class as noted science-fiction writer [[Robert J. Sawyer]]; they collaborated on their final [[TV Studio Lab]] assignment, a short science-fiction show.

In the early 1980s she worked at [[Mr. Gameway's Ark]], a game store in [[Downtown Toronto]]. From 1984 to 1992 she worked at [[Bakka-Phoenix|Bakka]], North America's oldest surviving science fiction book store, in Toronto.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hanover|first=Terri|author2=T. S.

Her first professional sale was to [[George Scithers]], the editor of ''[[Amazing Stories]]'' in 1985, who bought her short story "[[Third Time Lucky (short story)|Third Time Lucky]]".<ref name=tart/> She was a member of the [[Bunch of Seven]] writing group. In 1992, after living for 13 years in downtown Toronto, she moved with her four large cats to rural Ontario, where she currently resides with her wife, fellow fantasy writer [[Fiona Patton]].<ref>[http://www.afterellen.com/people/2007/3/tanyahuff Keith, Christie.

Huff is one of the most prominent Canadian authors in the category of [[contemporary fantasy]], a subgenre pioneered by [[Charles de Lint]]. Many of the scenes in her stories are near places where she has lived or frequented in Toronto, Kingston, and elsewhere. This author frequently uses as character names the names of people in her circle of acquaintances. A prolific author, "she has written everything from horror to romantic fantasy to contemporary fantasy to humour to space opera."<ref>{{cite web|author=Gaylaxicon 2006 |title=Additional Author Guest |url=http://gaylaxicon.gaylacticnetwork.org/2006/Guests.php |access-date=22 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716082105/http://gaylaxicon.gaylacticnetwork.org/2006/Guests.php |archive-date=16 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
