He was also the author of "Song against Drunkenness, Lies and Miserliness" (as ''Cerdd yn Erbyn Medd-dod, Celwydd a Chybydd-dra''), published in a booklet of three ballads by H. Lloyd of Shrewsbury and listed in the ''Bibliography of Welsh Ballads'' (1909–1911) by [[John Humphreys Davies|J. H. Davies]]. Another recorded work of his is the elegy "Ffarwel Ned Puw" (Farewell Ned Pugh).<ref>{{Cite DWB |author=David Myrddin Lloyd |title=Sion Abel |id=s-ABEL-SIO-1700 |accessdate=8 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.e-gymraeg.org/baledi/index.aspx?t%u00f4n=Ffarwel+Ned+Puw |title=John Abel |website=Ysgol y Gymraeg, Prifysgol Bangor ac Ysgol y Gymraeg, Prifysgol Caerdydd (School of Welsh at Bangor University and the School of Welsh, Cardiff University) |language=Welsh |accessdate=4 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |author=Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion (London, England) |title=The Transactions of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4f4cAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA2-PA60 |year=1908 |publisher=The Society |page=60}}</ref>
