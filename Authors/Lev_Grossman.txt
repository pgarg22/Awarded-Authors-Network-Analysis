===Fiction===
Lev Grossman's first novel, ''Warp'', was published in 1997 after he moved to New York City.<ref name="homepage"/> ''Warp'' was about "the lyrical misadventures of an aimless 20-something in Boston who has trouble distinguishing between reality and ''Star Trek''."<ref name=":0" /> It received largely negative customer reviews on Amazon.com, and in response, Grossman submitted fake reviews to [[Amazon (bookstore)|Amazon]] using false names. He then recounted these actions in an essay titled "Terrors of the Amazon".<ref>Lev Grossman. [https://www.salon.com/1999/03/02/feature_222/ "Terrors of the Amazon]", [[Salon.com]], March 2, 1999</ref> His second novel, ''[[Codex (novel)|Codex]]'', was published in 2004 and became an international bestseller.<ref name="homepage"/> After ''Codex'', Grossman published the book that he is most well known for, ''[[The Magicians (Grossman novel)|The Magicians]]''.

In an article for ''[[The New York Times]]'' Grossman wrote: "I wrote fiction for 17 years before I found out I was a fantasy novelist. Up till then I always thought I was going to write literary fiction, like Jonathan Franzen or Zadie Smith or Jhumpa Lahiri. But I thought wrong. ... Fantasy is sometimes dismissed as childish, or escapist, but I take what I am doing very, very seriously.<ref>[http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/16/finding-my-voice-in-fantasy/ Finding My Voice in Fantasy] by Lev Grossman, ''The New York Times'', August 16, 2014</ref>

Grossman's bestseller ''[[The Magicians (Grossman novel)|The Magicians]]'' was published in hardcover in August 2009. The trade paperback edition was made available on May 25, 2010. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called it "Exuberant and inventive...Fresh and compelling...a great fairy tale."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/31/AR2009073103670.html |title=Post-Harry Potter, The Spell Is Cast |author=Keith Donohoe |date=August 1, 2009 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=August 1, 2010}}</ref> The book is a dark [[contemporary fantasy]] about Quentin Coldwater, an unusually gifted young man who obsesses over Fillory, the magical land of his favorite childhood books. Unexpectedly admitted to Brakebills, a secret, exclusive college of magic in upstate New York (an amalgam of [[Pollepel Island|Bannerman's Castle]] and [[Olana]]), Quentin receives an education in the craft of modern sorcery. After graduation, he and his friends discover that Fillory is real.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.powells.com/biblio?PID=29198&cgi=product&isbn=9780670020553|title=Used, New, and Out of Print Books - We Buy and Sell - Powell's Books|author=Carlo Rovelli}}</ref>

Michael Agger of ''The New York Times'' said the book "could crudely be labeled a Harry Potter for adults," injecting mature themes into fantasy literature.<ref>{{cite news|last=Agger|first=Michael|title=Abracadabra Angst|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/13/books/review/Agger-t.html|work=The New York Times|access-date=24 June 2011|date=September 13, 2009}}</ref> ''The Magicians'' won the 2010 Alex Award, given to ten adult books that are appealing to young adults, and the 2011 [[John W.

In August 2011, ''[[The Magician King]]'', the sequel to ''The Magicians'', was published, which returns readers to the magical land of Fillory, where Quentin and his friends are now kings and queens. ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]'' said ''The Magician King'' was "''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'' for devotees of alternative universes" and that "Grossman has created a rare, strange and scintillating novel."<ref>{{cite news|last=Keller|first=Julia|title=At Summer's End, Adventure|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-08-12/entertainment/ct-ae-0814-lit-life-20110812_1_lev-grossman-high-adventure-quentin|access-date=September 23, 2011|newspaper=The Chicago Tribune|date=August 12, 2011}}</ref> It was an Editor's Choice pick of ''The New York Times'', who called it "[A] serious, heartfelt novel [that] turns the machinery of fantasy inside out."<ref>{{cite news|last=Kois|first=Dan|title=Further Adventures of a Magician from Brooklyn|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/28/books/review/the-magician-king-by-lev-grossman-book-review.html?pagewanted=all|access-date=September 23, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 26, 2011}}</ref>  ''The Boston Globe'' said "''The Magician King'' is a rare achievement, a book that simultaneously criticizes and celebrates our deep desire for fantasy."<ref>{{cite news|last=Domestico|first=Anthony|title=A teen-turned-king finds his way in dark fantasy world|url=http://articles.boston.com/2011-08-09/ae/29868692_1_traditional-fantasy-lev-grossman-quentin-coldwater|access-date=September 23, 2011|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=August 9, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829041545/http://articles.boston.com/2011-08-09/ae/29868692_1_traditional-fantasy-lev-grossman-quentin-coldwater|archive-date=August 29, 2011}}</ref>
