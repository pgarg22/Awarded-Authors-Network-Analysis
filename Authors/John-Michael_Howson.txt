'''John-Michael Howson''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|OAM}} (born 8 August 1936) is an Australian writer, reporter and entertainer and Melbourne radio commentator. His involvement in the Australian entertainment scene as a writer, producer and performer spans more than 50 years.

==Early life==
Howson was born on 8 August 1936 in [[Elwood, Victoria]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0398274/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1 IMDb database 15 May 2014]</ref><ref name="MelbOpera">{{cite news|url=http://www.melbourneopera.com/content/john-michael-howson|title=John-Michael Howson|author=Staff Writer|date=2006|newspaper=Melbourne Opera|access-date=25 November 2013}}</ref> His parents separated when he was young and he moved to [[Western Australia]] with his mother and step-father (a former policeman and publican).<ref name="ABCTH">[http://www.abc.net.au/talkingheads/txt/s1641324.htm ''Talking Heads'', 2006, "John-Michael Howson" (ABC-TV)] (Access: 31 May 2012)</ref> He was educated at [[New Norcia#Colleges|St Ildephonsus College]], [[New Norcia]], where he was a [[boarding school|boarder]].

== Career ==
Howson began his media career as a cadet reporter on [[Mildura, Victoria|Mildura]]'s ''[[Sunraysia Daily]]''.<ref name="TalkingHeads">[http://www.theage.com.au/news/people/showman-to-the-stars/2005/07/08/1120704540657.html Showman to the stars] ''[[The Age]]'', 9 July 2005</ref> After moving to Melbourne he started writing sketches and songs for amateur and professional groups and subsequently moved to London. There he worked for a men's fashion magazine and covered fashion topics in London and Europe. He pursued his writing career with comedy scripts for live revues, stand up comedians and television including the top British show ''[[That Was The Week That Was]]''.<ref name="MelbOpera" /> In 1964, he was invited to write topical material for the fledgling Melbourne television station [[Ten Network#Origins|ATV-0]] and specifically for their new variety programme ''The Ray Taylor Show''.

He became primarily known in television for his involvement in the acclaimed ATV-0 children's fantasy television series ''[[Magic Circle Club|The Magic Circle Club]]'' (1965–67) in which he played Fee Fee Bear (his face never seen on camera due to the bear suit), and as Clown in the follow-up [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] show [[Adventure Island (TV series)|''Adventure Island'']],  (1967–72). Howson, with [[Godfrey Philipp]], was co-creator of both shows. Howson wrote the vast bulk of the scripts (five 30-minute shows per week) and the lyrics to the original songs used in them, the music usually composed by [[Bruce Rowland]]. Owing to Howson's intense workload, many of the ''Adventure Island'' scripts were written on a typewriter positioned behind the set. Howson also contributed scripts and sketches to [[Graham Kennedy|Graham Kennedy's]] ''[[In Melbourne Tonight]]'' and to ''[[The Mavis Bramston Show]]''. His 1965 ''Bramston'' "Flower arranging" sketch - in which a section of [[Constance Spry|Constance Spry's]] definitive text book on the subject is quoted verbatim in a lascivious manner by the Chief Censor ([[Gordon Chater]]) to hilarious and scandalous effect - created a national uproar and remains a television classic.

===Film and television acting===
In 1975, Howson appeared as an over-attentive bellboy in the Australian movie ''[[Alvin Rides Again]]''. In 1976, producer-director George Stamkoski filmed a documentary portrait of Howson entitled "Hollywood Hollywood" with a grant from the Australian Film Commission. Howson revealed the serious side of his acting skills in the 1976 ABC television adaptation of [[Frank Hardy|Frank Hardy's]] ''[[Power Without Glory]]''. He also briefly appeared in the 1978 film ''[[The ABC of Love and Sex: Australia Style]] also in the soft porn film Felicity, directed by John D Lamond.<ref>Felicity film credits</ref>''. During the 1980s, he starred in ''[[Houseboat Horror]]'', an Australian [[feature film]] shot to [[videotape]], and often included on lists of the [[worst movies ever made]].

===Theatrical productions===
In the late 1960s, Howson also turned his talents as a scriptwriter and lyricist to the creation of original Australian stage musicals, working in collaboration with local composers. Early examples included ''Razza-ma-tazz (and all that Jazz)'', which was set in Melbourne's pre-war [[Red-light district]], [[Little Lonsdale Street, Melbourne|Little Lonsdale Street]]. With a cast that included veteran stage actress [[Madeleine Orr]], the show was produced at the Southland Theatre in 1968. That same year, Howson collaborated with [[Peter Pinne]] and [[Don Battye]] on the musical ''It happened in Tanjablanka'', which was a spoof of Hollywood in the 1940s. In 1972, Howson wrote ''What's in a name'', a straight play on the subject of prejudice and intolerance in modern society, which was performed at St Paul's Cathedral in Melbourne.<ref>"Dick has done everything - even 'freedom' dance", ''The Age'', 26 April 1972, p 17.</ref>  The following year, he adapted the play ''[[Norman, Is That You?]]'' for Australian audiences, which had successful seasons in Melbourne and Sydney. The adaptation included a new title song, co-written by Howson with composer [[Peter Best (composer)|Peter Best]], which was recorded and released as a single by the show's star, [[Bobby Limb]].<ref>"Dancers bobbled, she says", ''The Age'', 20 March 1974, p 20.</ref>

The late 1990s saw Howson return to the creation of stage musicals, albeit this time in the form of [[jukebox musical]]s rather than entirely original shows with original music.  ''[[Shout! The Legend of The Wild One]]'', a stage musical about the life of singer [[Johnny O'Keefe]], was co-written by Howson with [[Melvyn Morrow]] and David Mitchell, and made its premiere in Melbourne in the early 2000s (decade). With the same team, Howson also co-wrote a musical about [[Dusty Springfield]] called ''[[Dusty - The Original Pop Diva]]'', which opened in Melbourne in 2006. In 2007, it was reported that Howson was collaborating on a new musical, ''Hotel Havana'', with composer Jason Sprague.<ref>Cockington, James. "Shell out for these beach beauties", ''The Age'', 16 May 2007.</ref>  Other original musicals Howson developed included ''Pyjamas in Paradise'',<ref>{{Cite web|title=Pyjamas in Paradise {{!}} David Spicer Productions|url=https://www.davidspicer.com.au/shows/pyjamas-paradise#:~:text=Before%20there%20was%20Schoolies,%20there,put%20Surfers%20on%20the%20map.|access-date=2021-01-05|website=www.davidspicer.com.au}}</ref> about teenage parties at [[Surfers Paradise]], [[Queensland]], and ''[[Dream Lover: The Bobby Darin Musical|Dream Lover]]'', a jukebox musical about [[Bobby Darin]].

===Reporter===
He is sometimes referred to as "John-Michael 'Hollywood' Howson" when filing showbiz news reports, a nickname first coined by [[Mike Walsh (TV host)|Mike Walsh]] when Howson began appearing on ''[[The Mike Walsh Show]]''. His reports continued when the show was replaced by ''[[Midday (Australian TV program)|The Midday Show with Ray Martin]]''. Howson became well known for his flamboyant, clever and catty commentary on the celebrity A-list. Determined to further his writing career, Howson moved to [[West Hollywood]] but remained a reporter for [[Ten Network|Network Ten's]] ''[[Good Morning Australia (1992–2005)|Good Morning Australia]]'' with [[Bert Newton]]. He also reported for [[3AW]] with [[Ernie Sigley]], and remained a 3AW regular until his dismissal over controversial comments in November 2017.

===Writer===
Howson's book ''I Found It At The Flickers'' was published by Horwitz Grahame Books in 1985. Howson has published two collections of horror stories - ''Once Upon a Nightmare: Ten Tales with a Twist'' (Pan Macmillan,  1998) and ''Deadly Dreams: Ten More Tales with Twist'' (Pan Macmillan, 2000). Howson wrote ''I Found it at the Flickers'' a 1985 autobiographical account of his growing up in Melbourne emphasising his love of the cinema.

===Radio panelist===
Howson was a regular panelist on 3AW's Sunday morning program, 'Sunday Morning'. During his appearances on 3AW, Howson has adopted vehemently anti-Muslim views, indicating that he would prefer not to talk to Muslims and referring to Muslims as "skilled propagandists".<ref name="Mediwatch: Veiled Censorship" /> The [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s [[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]] program did a segment outlining Howson's behaviour and views in May 2010.<ref name="Mediwatch: Veiled Censorship">{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s2901875.htm |title=Veiled Censorship |first=Paul |last=Barry |publisher=Media Watch |date=17 May 2010 |access-date=20 November 2013}}</ref>

In February 2011, Howson had an abusive on-air tantrum over the Seven network's treatment of Opposition Leader and future Prime Minister [[Tony Abbott]], in an interview with journalist [[Mark Riley (journalist)|Mark Riley]]. He verbally abused his radio 3AW co-presenter [[Nick McCallum]], who was also a Channel Seven reporter and hurled sexist insults at a female producer, Cushla Travers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/up-yours-darling-howson-slammed-over-radio-meltdown-20110214-1at0l.html|first=Thomas|last=Carmody| title='Up yours, darling': Howson slammed over radio meltdown|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|date=14 February 2011 |access-date=17 January 2018}}</ref>

In 2012, he called [[Julian Assange]]'s mother "a pig" and taunted her with a Nazi slogan, for which he apologised but was suspended for a month.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/radio-presenter-howson-suspended-for-nazi-gibe-20120820-24hmj.html|first=Broede|last=Carmody |title=Radio presenter Howson suspended for Nazi gibe| publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|date=20 August 2011 |access-date=21 November 2017}}</ref> In 2016, Howson used a derogatory term when discussing African gangs. He told the Herald Sun,"I don’t care if people think it was racist it was a name that came into my head". 3AW management issued a statement later that day, "3AW does not condone the use of a derogatory term by John-Michael Howson on the Sunday Morning program today".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.radioinfo.com.au/news/3aw%E2%80%99s-john-michael-howson-hot-water-over-racist-jibe|title='3AW's John-Michael Howson in hot water over racist jibe'|publisher=radioinfo|date=22 August 2016|access-date=17 January 2018}}</ref>

In November 2017, Howson went on a wild rant about "anti-coal nutjobs", suggesting climate change activists should kill themselves. He was forced to apologise later that day and meet management to discuss broadcasting codes and content.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/neil-mitchell-takes-fellow-3aw-broadcaster-to-task-over-garbage-comments-20171121-gzpkhi.html|title=Neil Mitchell takes fellow 3AW broadcaster to task over 'garbage' comments |first=Broede |last=Carmody |publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|date=21 November 2017|access-date=21 November 2017}}</ref> He was subsequently dismissed from [[3AW]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/johnmichael-howson-dumped-by-3aw-following-go-hang-yourself-antigreens-tirade-20171201-gzwt5p.html|title=Too much to bear: John-Michael Howson dumped by 3AW following 'go hang yourself' anti-Greens tirade|last=Quinn|first=Karl|date=2017-12-01|work=Canberra Times|access-date=2018-01-08|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Honours==
Howson was awarded an [[Order of Australia]] Medal in the 2009 Queen's Birthday Honours list "for service to the entertainment industry as a writer and performer".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?breif=true&page=1&search_type=simple |title=Medal of the Order of Australia |publisher=It's an Honour |access-date=2014-06-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305083246/http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?breif=true&page=1&search_type=simple |archive-date=5 March 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

==Personal life==
Howson lived in the Melbourne suburb of Balaclava for many years. He then moved to Los Angeles for 17 years and now holds dual US-Australian citizenship.

Following the success of ''Shout'' he relocated back to [[Melbourne, Australia]] in 2006<ref name="Raconteur">{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/raconteur-and-writer-of-many-roles-and-faces-20090607-bzu2.html |title=Raconteur and writer of many roles and faces |first=Farah |last=Farouque |newspaper=[[The Age]] |date=8 June 2009 |access-date=25 November 2013}}</ref> where he lives with his [[Guatemala]]n partner, Alfie, and their three dogs. In recent years, Howson  has been publicly open about his homosexuality, a subject about which he was previously very guarded, mainly due to his conservative Roman Catholic beliefs.<ref name="ABCTH" />

==Community service==

Howson is a patron of both the [[Melbourne Gay and Lesbian Chorus]] and of the [[St James the Great, St Kilda East|St James the Great]] annual [[Francis of Assisi|St Francis's Day]] Blessing of Animals.<ref>[http://stjamesthegreat.org.au/2011-11-30-12-14-37/annual-blessing-of-the-animals.html St James' Church website]; The Annual Blessing of Animals</ref>
