'''George Francis Abbott''' (June 25, 1887 – January 31, 1995) was an American theater producer and director, playwright, screenwriter, and film director and producer whose career spanned eight decades.<ref name=EB>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Abbott, George|edition=15th|year=2010|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|volume=I: A– Ak–Bayes|location=Chicago, Illinois|isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=[https://archive.org/details/newencyclopaedia2009ency/page/13 13]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/newencyclopaedia2009ency/page/13}}</ref>

==Early years==
Abbott was born in [[Forestville, New York]], to George Burwell Abbott (May 1858 [[Erie County, New York]] – February 4, 1942 [[Hamburg, New York]]) and Hannah May McLaury (1869 – June 20, 1940 [[Hamburg, New York]]). He later moved to the city of [[Salamanca, New York|Salamanca]], which twice elected his father mayor. In 1898, his family moved to [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]], where he attended [[List of defunct United States military academies|Kearney Military Academy]]. Within a few years, his family returned to New York, and he graduated from [[Hamburg (town), New York|Hamburg]] High School in 1907. Four years later, he obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from the [[University of Rochester]],<ref name=EB/><ref name=monitor>
Sweeney, Louise. [https://www.csmonitor.com/1983/0106/010636.html "Director George Abbott"] ''Christian Science Monitor'', January 6, 1983</ref> where he wrote his first play, ''Perfectly Harmless'', for the University Dramatic Club. Abbott then attended [[Harvard University]], to take a course in playwriting from [[George Pierce Baker]].<ref name=monitor/> Under Baker's tutelage, he wrote ''The Head of the Family'', which was performed at the Harvard Dramatic Club in 1912.<ref name="Masterworks Broadway">{{ cite web | url=http://www.masterworksbroadway.com/artist/george-abbott | title=George Abbott | author= Lucy E. Cross | publisher= [[Masterworks Broadway]] | access-date=October 20, 2013}}</ref> He then worked for a year as 
"author, gofer, and actor" at the [[Bijou Theatre (Boston)|Bijou Theatre]] in [[Boston]], where his play ''The Man in the Manhole'' won a contest.<ref name=monitor/>

==Career==
[[File:Abbott-Dunning-1928.jpg|thumb|left|George Abbott and [[Philip Dunning]] (1928)]]
Abbott started acting on Broadway in 1913, debuting in ''The Misleading Lady''.<ref name=EB/><ref name=pbs>[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/broadway/stars/george-abbott/ "George Abbott. The Stars"] pbs.com, accessed August 5, 2019</ref> While acting in several plays in New York City, he began to write; his first successful play was ''The Fall Guy'' (1925).<ref name=EB/><ref name=pbs/>

Abbott acquired a reputation as an astute "show doctor". He frequently was called upon to supervise changes when a show was having difficulties in tryouts or previews prior to its Broadway opening.<ref>[http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19950201&slug=2102421#_ga=2.194453357.1994519093.1565032862-868989305.1565032861 "Theater's `Mr. Abbott' Dies At 107"] ''Seattle Times'', February 1, 1995</ref> His first hit was ''[[Broadway (play)|Broadway]]'', written and directed in partnership with [[Philip Dunning]], whose play Abbott "rejiggered".<ref>{{cite web | author = Staff | url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/106449/page/1 |title=Theater: Director/Writer George Abbott, 1887&ndash;1995 |work=[[Newsweek]] |date=February 13, 1995 |access-date= August 28, 2013}}</ref> It opened on September 16, 1926, at the [[Broadhurst Theatre]] and ran for 603 performances. Other successes followed, and it was a rare year that did not have an Abbott production on Broadway.

He also worked in Hollywood as a film writer and director <ref name=latimes/> while continuing with his theater work.

Among those who worked with Abbott early in their careers are [[Desi Arnaz]], [[Gene Kelly]], [[June Havoc]], [[Betty Comden]], [[Adolph Green]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Jule Styne]], [[Stephen Sondheim]], [[Elaine Stritch]], [[John Kander]], [[Fred Ebb]], [[Carol Burnett]] and [[Liza Minnelli]].<ref name=latimes>Folkart, Burt.[https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-02-01-mn-26674-story.html "George Abbott; Legendary Broadway Producer, 107"] ''Los Angeles Times'', February 1, 1995</ref> He introduced the "fast-paced, tightly integrated style that influenced" performers and especially directors such as [[Jerome Robbins]], [[Bob Fosse]] and [[Hal Prince]].<ref name=pbs/>

==Autobiography ==
In 1963, he published his autobiography, ''Mister Abbott''.<ref name=EB/>

==Personal life==
Abbott was married to Edna Lewis from 1914 to her death in 1930; they had one child. Actress [[Mary Sinclair]] was his second wife. Their marriage lasted from 1946 until their 1951 divorce.<ref name=people>Arias, Ron (July 6, 1987). [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20096668,00.html Marking His First Century, George Abbott Once Again Brings Broadway to Broadway"]. ''[[People (magazine)|People]]''.  Vol. 28, No. 1.  Retrieved August 28, 2013.</ref> He had a long romance with actress [[Maureen Stapleton]]<ref name="Masterworks Broadway"/> from 1968 to 1978. She was 43 and he was 81 when they began their affair, then ten years later Abbott left her for a younger woman.<ref>Database (undated). [http://www.nndb.com/people/376/000032280/ "Maureen Stapleton"].  [[Notable Names Database]].</ref> His third wife was Joy Valderrama. They were married from 1983 until his death in 1995.<ref name=people/><ref name=berger/>

Abbott was a vigorous man who remained active past his 100th birthday by golfing and dancing. He died of a stroke on January 31, 1995, at his home on [[Sunset Island]] off [[Miami Beach]], Florida, at age 107. ''[[The New York Times]]'' obituary read, "Mrs. Abbott said that a week and a half before his death he was dictating revisions to the second act of ''Pajama Game'' with a revival in mind, in addition to working on a revival of ''Damn Yankees''. At the age of 106, he walked down the aisle on opening night of the ''Damn Yankees'' revival and received a standing ovation. He was heard saying to his companion, 'There must be somebody important here.'" Just thirteen days before his 107th birthday, Abbott made an appearance at the [[48th Tony Awards]], coming onstage with fellow ''Damn Yankees'' alumni [[Gwen Verdon]] and [[Jean Stapleton]] at the end of the opening number, a medley performed by the nominees for Best Revival of A Musical, which included ''Grease'', ''She Loves Me'', ''Carousel'', and his own ''Damn Yankees''.<ref name=berger>[[Marilyn Berger|Berger, Marilyn]] (February 2, 1995).

He was cremated at [[Woodlawn Park Cemetery]] in Miami and the ashes were taken by his wife.<ref>Resting Places: The Burial Places of 14,000 Famous Persons, by Scott Wilson</ref>

==Family==

In addition to his wife, who died in 2020 at 88, Abbott was survived by a sister, Isabel Juergens, who died a year later at the age of 102; two granddaughters, Amy Clark Davidson and Susan Clark Hansley; a grandson, George Clark, and six great-grandchildren.<ref name=berger/>

==Honors==
In 1965, the [[54th Street (Manhattan)|54th Street]] Theatre was rechristened the [[George Abbott Theater]] in his honor. The building was demolished in 1970.<ref name="Masterworks Broadway"/><ref>[https://www.ibdb.com/theatre/george-abbott-theatre-1123 "George Abbott Theater"] ibdb.com, accessed August 5, 2019</ref> New York City's [[George Abbott Way]], the section of West 45th Street northwest of [[Times Square]], is also named after him.

He received New York City's [[Handel Medallion]] in 1976, honorary doctorates from the Universities of [[University of Rochester|Rochester]] and [[University of Miami|Miami]], and the [[Kennedy Center Honors|Kennedy Center Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 1982.<ref name=berger /> He was also inducted into the Western New York Entertainment Hall of Fame<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buffaloah.com/a/main/646/hall/index.html|title=The Western New York Entertainment Hall of Fame|access-date=February 20, 2012}}</ref> and the [[American Theatre Hall of Fame]].
