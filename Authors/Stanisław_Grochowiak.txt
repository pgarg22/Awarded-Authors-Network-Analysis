'''Stanisław Antoni Grochowiak,''' pen-name "Kain" (24 January 1934 – 2 September 1976) was a [[Polish poet]] and [[dramatist]]. His is often classified as a representative of [[turpism]] ([[Polish language|Polish]]: [[:pl:Turpizm|turpizm]]), because of his interest in the physical, ugly and brutal, but he also exhibits strong tendencies toward formal, rhymed poetry, reaching on many occasions the ornamental grace of a [[baroque]] style.  Grochowiak was born in [[Leszno]] and died, aged 42, in [[Warsaw]].
