'''Susanne Antonetta''' is the pen name of '''Suzanne Paola''' (born 1956, in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]), an American poet and author who is most widely known for her book ''Body Toxic: An Environmental Memoir''.  In 2001, ''Body Toxic'' was named by the ''[[New York Times]]'' as a "Notable Book". An excerpt of "Body Toxic" was published as a stand-alone essay which was recognized as a "Notable Essay" in the 1998 [[Best American Essays|Best American Essays 1998]] anthology. She has published several prize-winning collections of poems, including ''Bardo'', a [[Brittingham Prize in Poetry]] winner, and the poetry books ''Petitioner'', ''Glass'', and most recently ''The Lives of The Saints''. She currently resides in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] with her husband and adopted son. She is widely published both in newspapers such as ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'', as well as in literary journals including ''Orion'', ''Brevity'', ''JuxtaProse Literary Magazine'', ''Seneca Review'', and ''[[Image (journal)|Image]]''. She is the current Editor-in-Chief of ''[[Bellingham Review]]''.

== Early life ==
Paola was raised among the [[New Jersey Pine Barrens]], which she later used as the setting for ''Body Toxic'', in one of the most [[natural environment|environmentally]] contaminated counties in the United States. Paola's memoir merges her personal and familial sagas with historical accounts, politics, and environmentalism.

== Career ==
Paola writes about how the poisoned landscape of her New Jersey childhood devastated her body, causing [[cardiac arrhythmia]], [[seizure]]s, severe allergies, and [[infertility|sterility]]. She recounts the story of the [[Radium Girls]], details aspects of the frequent [[nuclear material|nuclear]] and [[industrial waste]] debacles in New Jersey, and relates these events to her family and neighbors.

Paola's memoir disputes attribution of her afflictions to [[genetics|genetic]] vulnerability, [[random]] chance, or [[recreational drug use]]. Vignettes depicting colossal man-made environmental disasters are woven into her story, accenting the recurrent medical catastrophes she endured, including [[endometriosis]], rampant [[thyroid]] tumors, a quadruplet pregnancy (without [[fertility drug]]s) that ended in [[miscarriage]], numerous growths on her liver and ovarian cysts that necessarily had to be removed, alongside repeated bouts of [[Bipolar disorder|manic-depression]]. The latter condition was treated with [[psychotropic drug]]s, some of which are derived from the very same dye chemicals dumped, sometimes recklessly, into the environment of southern New Jersey.
