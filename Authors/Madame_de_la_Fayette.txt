'''Marie-Madeleine Pioche de La Vergne, comtesse de La Fayette''' ([[baptism|baptized]] 18 March 1634 – 25 May 1693), better known as '''Madame de La Fayette''', was a French writer; she authored ''[[La Princesse de Clèves]]'', France's first [[historical novel]] and one of the earliest [[novel]]s in literature.

== Life ==
Christened Marie-Madeleine Pioche de La Vergne, she was born in Paris to a family of minor but wealthy nobility. At 16, de la Vergne became the [[maid of honour]] to [[Anne of Austria|Queen Anne of Austria]] and began also to acquire a literary education from [[Gilles Ménage]], who gave her lessons in Italian and [[Latin]]. Ménage led her to join the fashionable [[Salon (gathering)|salons]] of [[Madame de Rambouillet]] and [[Madeleine de Scudéry]]. Her father, Marc Pioche de la Vergne, had died a year before, and the same year her mother married Renaud de Sévigné, uncle of [[Madame de Sévigné]], who remained her lifelong intimate friend.

In 1655, de la Vergne married François Motier, comte de La Fayette, a widowed nobleman some eighteen years her senior, with whom she had two sons. She accompanied him to country estates in [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]] and [[Bourbonnais]] although she made frequent trips back to Paris, where she began to mix with court society and formed her own successful salon. Her sister-in-law was [[Louise de La Fayette]] (1618–1665), [[favourite]] of [[Louis XIII of France]]. Some of her acquaintances included [[Henrietta Anne Stuart|Henrietta of England]], future Duchess of Orleans, who asked La Fayette to write her biography; [[Antoine Arnauld]]; and the leading French writers [[Jean Renaud de Segrais|Segrais]] and [[Pierre Daniel Huet|Huet]]. Earlier on, during the [[Fronde]], La Fayette had also befriended the [[Cardinal de Retz]] with whom her stepfather was associated.

Settling permanently in Paris in 1659, La Fayette published, anonymously, ''[[The Princess of Montpensier (novella)|La Princesse de Montpensier]]'' in 1662. From 1665 onwards she formed a close relationship with [[François de La Rochefoucauld (writer)|François de La Rochefoucauld]], author of ''Maximes'', who introduced her to many literary luminaries of the time, including [[Jean Racine|Racine]] and [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]]. 1669 saw the publication of the first volume of ''Zaïde'', a Hispano-Moorish [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] which was signed by Segrais but is almost certainly attributable to La Fayette. The second volume appeared in 1671. The title ran through reprints and translations mostly thanks to the preface Huet had offered.

La Fayette's most famous novel was ''[[La Princesse de Clèves]]'', first published anonymously in March 1678. An immense success, the work is often taken to be the first true French novel and a prototype of the early [[psychological novel]].

Her correspondence showed her as the acute diplomatic agent of [[Marie Jeanne Baptiste of Savoy-Nemours]], duchess of [[Savoy]], at the court of Louis XIV.

The death of La Rochefoucauld in 1680 and her husband in 1683 led La Fayette to lead a less active social life in her later years. Three works were published posthumously: ''La Comtesse de Tende'' (1718), ''Histoire d'Henriette d'Angleterre'' (1720), and ''Memoires de la Cour de France'' (1731).

== Family ==
Marie-Madeleine Pioche de La Vergne was the eldest daughter of Marc Pioche (–1649), Esquire to the King, Sieur de La Vergne and the tutor to [[Cardinal Richelieu]]'s nephew, [[Jean Armand de Maille-Breze]], and Isabella Pena (–1656) daughter of François Pena, physician of the King, and his wife, Michelle Coupe.

Her baptism took place March 18, 1634 in the [[Church of Saint-Sulpice, Paris|Church of Saint-Sulpice]]. Her godfather was [[Urbain de Maillé-Brézé]], [[Marshal of France]], and her godmother was [[Duchess of Aiguillon|Marie-Madelaine de Vignerot]], lady Combalet, later Duchess of Aiguillon, a niece of Richelieu. 

Her marriage took place in the [[Church of Saint-Sulpice, Paris|Church of Saint-Sulpice]].

She is buried in the [[Church of Saint-Sulpice, Paris|Church of Saint-Sulpice]].

Marie-Madeleine had two younger sisters:
* Eleonore-Armande, baptized 1635
* Isabelle Louise, born 1636

Her mother, Isabella Pena, remarried in 1650 to René Renaud de Sevigne (–1656), uncle of the [[Marquise de Sevigne]].

She married on February 15, 1655 to François Motier, comte de La Fayette (brother of [[Louise de La Fayette]]) (1616–1683). He held several lands in the Auvergne region such as de La Fayette, de Goutenoutouse, de Médat and de Forest. They had two sons:
* Louis de Lafayette (1658–1729), baptized March 7, 1658, [[commendatory abbot]] of [[Valmont Abbey|Notre-Dame de Valmont]];
* Armand Renaud de La Fayette (1659–1694), [[Brigadier|''Brigadier des armées'']], [[count]] and [[marquis]] de la  Fayette.
