'''Ali Ahmad Said Esber''' ({{Lang-ar|علي أحمد سعيد إسبر}}<small>, [[Levantine Arabic|North Levantine]]:</small> {{IPA-ar|ˈʕali ˈʔaħmad saˈʕiːd ˈʔesbeɾ}}; born 1 January 1930), also known by the [[pen name]] '''Adonis''' or '''Adunis''' ({{lang-ar|أدونيس}} {{IPA-ar|ʔadoːˈniːs}}), is a [[Syrian people|Syrian]] poet, essayist and translator. He led a modernist revolution in the second half of the 20th century, "exerting a seismic influence" on [[Arabic poetry]] comparable to [[T.S. Eliot]]'s in the anglophone world.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/jan/27/adonis-syrian-poet-life-in-writing|title=Adonis: a life in writing|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group|date=27 January 2012|access-date=27 January 2012|quote=...He led a modernist revolution in the second half of the 20th century, exerting a seismic influence on Arabic poetry comparable to TS Eliot's in the anglophone world}}</ref>

Adonis's publications include twenty volumes of poetry and thirteen of criticism. His dozen books of translation to Arabic include the poetry of [[Saint-John Perse]] and [[Yves Bonnefoy]], and the first complete Arabic translation of [[Ovid]]'s "[[Metamorphoses]]" (2002). His multi-volume anthology of Arabic poetry ("Dīwān ash-shi'r al-'arabī"), covering almost two millennia of verse, has been in print since its publication in 1964.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Born to a modest [[Alawites|Alawite]] farming family<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lexicorient.com/e.o/adonis.htm|title=Adonis|work=Lexicorient|access-date=5 November 2015|archive-date=6 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006070838/http://lexicorient.com/e.o/adonis.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref> in January 1930, Adonis hails from the village of [[al-Qassabin]] near the city of [[Latakia]] in western [[Syria]]. He was unable to afford formal schooling for most of his childhood, and his early education consisted of learning the [[Quran]] in the local [[kuttab]] (mosque-affiliated school) and memorizing classical Arabic poetry, to which his father had introduced him.

In 1944, despite the animosity of the village chief and his father's reluctance, the young poet managed to recite one of his poems before [[Shukri al-Quwatli]], the president of the newly-established Republic of Syria, who was on a visit to al-Qassabin. After admiring the boy's verses, al-Quwatli asked him if there were anything he needed help with. "I want to go to school," responded the young poet, and his wish was soon fulfilled in the form of a scholarship to the French lycée at [[Tartus]]. The school, the last French Lycée school in Syria at the time, was closed in 1945, and Adonis was transferred to other national schools before graduating in 1949. He was a good student, and managed to secure a government scholarship. In 1950 Adonis published his first collection of verse, ''Dalila'', as he joined the Syrian University (now [[Damascus University]]) to study law and philosophy, graduating in 1954 with a BA in philosophy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alowaisnet.org/en/winnersbio/abijjhjjhhcjgiacgf.aspx|title=BA in philosophy, Damascus University, 1954}}</ref> He later earned a doctoral degree in [[Arabic literature]] in 1973 from [[Saint Joseph University]].

While serving in the military in 1955–56, Adonis was imprisoned for his membership in the [[Syrian Social Nationalist Party]] (following the assassination of [[Adnan al-Malki]]), Led by [[Antoun Saadeh]], the SSNP had opposed European colonization of Greater Syria and its partition into smaller nations. The party advocated a secular, national (not strictly Arab) approach toward transforming Greater Syria into a progressive society governed by consensus and providing equal rights to all, regardless of ethnicity or sect.

===Name===
The name "[[Adonis]]" (pronounced ah-doh-NEES) was picked up by Adonis himself at age 17, after being rejected by a number of magazines under his real name, to "alert napping editors to his precocious talent and his pre-Islamic, pan-Mediterranean muses".<ref name="Adonis: a life in writing">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/jan/27/adonis-syrian-poet-life-in-writing|title=Adonis: a life in writing}}</ref>

===Personal life===
Adonis was married in 1956 to literary critic Khalida Said (née Saleh),<ref name="Adonis: a life in writing"/> who assisted in editing roles in both ''Shiʿr'' and ''Mawaqif''.
They have two daughters: Arwad, who is director of the House of World Cultures in Paris; and Ninar, an artist who moves between Paris and Beirut. Adonis has lived in [[Paris]], [[France]], since 1975.

In his book ''Identité Inachevée'' he expresses opposition to "religion as an institution imposed on the whole of society" but support of individual religious freedom. He describes himself as a "[[paganism|pagan]] [[mysticism|mystic]]", elaborating:

{{quote|text=Mysticism, to my sense, is founded on the following elements: firstly, that reality is comprehensive, boundless, unrestricted; it is both what is revealed and visible to us, and what is invisible and concealed. Secondly, that which is visible and revealed to us is not necessarily an actual expression of truth; it is perhaps an expression of a superficial, transitory, ephemeral aspect of truth.  To be able to truthfully express reality, one must also seek to see that which is concealed. Thirdly, truth is not ready-made, prefabricated. ...  We don't learn the truth from books! Truth is to be sought out, dug up, discovered. Consequently, the world is not finished business.  It is in constant flashes of revelation, creation, construction, and renewal of imageries, relationships, languages, words, and things.<ref>[http://fmwww.bc.edu/SL-R/salamehAntholSample.pdf The "Other" Middle East; An Anthology of Levantine Literature, in Search of Identity p. 26]</ref>}}In an interview at the occasion of the release of his new book Adoniada in France he stated that, in his view, religion and poetry were contradictory because "religion is an ideology, it is an answer whereas poetry remains always a question".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Trapenard|first=Augustin|title=L'Odyssée d'Adonis|url=https://www.franceinter.fr/emissions/boomerang/boomerang-09-mars-2021|url-status=live|access-date=2021-04-17|website=www.franceinter.fr|language=fr}}</ref>

===Beirut and Paris===
In 1956, Adonis fled Syria for [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]]. He joined a vibrant community of artists, writers, and exiles; Adonis settled abroad and has made his career largely in Lebanon and [[France]], where in 1957 he founded the magazine ''Majallat Shiʿr'' ("Poetry Magazine") that met with strong criticism as they published experimental poetry, and was arguably the most influential Arab literary journal ever<ref>Moreh, Shmuel. ''Modern Arabic Poetry 1800–1970: The Development of its Forms and Themes under the Influence of Western Literature''. Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1976: 278–280; 285; 288.</ref> ''Majallat Shiʿr'' ceased publication in 1964, and Adonis did not rejoin the ''Shiʿr'' editors when they resumed publication in 1967. In Lebanon, his intense nationalistic feelings, reflecting pan-Arabism focused on the Arab peoples as a nation, found their outlet in the Beirut newspaper ''[[Lisan al Hal|Lisan al-Hal]]'' and eventually in his founding of another literary periodical in 1968 titled ''Mawāqif'', in which he again published experimental poetry.<ref>Snir, Reuven. ''Mysticism and Poetry in Arabic Literature''. Orientalia Suecana XLIII-XLIV (1994–5) 165–175. V. Sufi Terms in the Service of Social Values, 171-3.</ref>

Adonis's poems continued to express his nationalistic views combined with his mystical outlook. With his use of [[Sufism|Sufi]] terms (the technical meanings of which were implied rather than explicit), Adonis became a leading exponent of the Neo-Sufi trend in modern Arabic poetry. This trend took hold in the 1970s.<ref>Butt, Aviva. "Adonis, Mysticism and the Neo-Sufi Trend" in ''Poets from a War Torn World''. SBPRA, 2012: pp. 2–7.</ref>

Adonis received a scholarship to study in Paris from 1960–61. From 1970–85 he was professor of Arabic literature at the Lebanese University. In 1976, he was a visiting professor at the University of Damascus. In 1980, he emigrated to [[Paris]] to escape the [[Lebanese Civil War]]. In 1980–81, he was professor of Arabic in Paris. From 1970 to 1985 he taught Arabic literature at the Lebanese University; he also has taught at the [[University of Damascus]], [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] (Paris III), and, in the United States, at Georgetown and Princeton universities. In 1985 he moved with his wife and two daughters to Paris, which has remained their primary residence.

While temporally in Syria, Adonis helped in editing the cultural supplement of the newspaper ''[[Al-Thawra (newspaper)|Al-Thawra]]'' but pro government writers clashed with his agenda and forced him to flee the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goetheprize.com/hot/2011-adonis-poet.html|title=but pro government writers clashed with his agenda and forced him to flee the country}}</ref>

==Editorship==
===''Majallat Shiʿr''===
Adonis joined ranks with Syro-Lebanese poet [[Yusuf al-Khal]] in editing ''Majallat Shiʿr'' (English: "Poetry Magazine"), a modernist [[Arabic poetry]] magazine, which Al-Khal established in 1957. His name appeared as editor from the magazine's fourth edition. By 1962 the magazine appeared with both Adonis and Al-Khal's names side by side as "Owners and Editors in Chief".<ref>{{cite news|first=Youssef M.|last=Ibrahim|url=http://www.alawan.org/%D8%A3%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%B3-%D9%8A%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%AF%D8%AB.html|title=Translation from Arabic to the line: by 1962 the magazine appeared with both Adonis and Al-Khal names side by side as "Owners and Editors in Chief"|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304034104/http://www.alawan.org/%D8%A3%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%B3-%D9%8A%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%AF%D8%AB.html|archive-date=2016-03-04}}</ref> While at ''Shiʿr'', Adonis played an important role in the evolution of free verse in Arabic. Adonis and al-Khal asserted that modern verse needed to go beyond the experimentation of "al-shiʿr al-hadith" (modern, or free, verse), which had appeared nearly two decades earlier.

Also responding to a growing mandate that poetry and literature be committed to the immediate political needs of the Arab nation and the masses, Adonis and ''Shiʿr'' energetically opposed the recruitment of poets and writers into propagandist efforts. In rejecting "al-ʾadab al-iltizām" ('politically committed literature'), Adonis was opposing the suppression of the individual's imagination and voice for the needs of the group. Poetry, he argued, must remain a realm in which language and ideas are examined, reshaped, and refined, in which the poet refuses to descend to the level of daily expediencies.

''Shiʿr'' was published for ten years and was arguably the most influential Arab literary journal ever;<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.yalebooks.com/yupbooks/excerpts/margellos_poetry_sampler2.pdf|title=Selected Poems by Adonis- Introduction}}</ref> it was recognized as the main platform and prime mover for the modernism movement in Arabic literature, it featured and helped bring to light poets such as [[Ounsi el-Hajj]], [[Saadi Yousef]] and many others.<ref name="www.jehat.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.jehat.com/Jehaat/ar/Mawasem/AmalNawar.htm|title=Translation from Arabic: Poetry Magazine and the lessons of modernism – مجلة "شعر" ودرس الحداثة|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150801231943/http://www.jehat.com/Jehaat/ar/Mawasem/AmalNawar.htm|archive-date=2015-08-01}}</ref>

===''Mawaqif''===
Adonis later started another poetry magazine, titled ''Mawaqif'' (English: "Positions"); the magazine was first published in 1968, considered a significant literary and cultural quarterly. Adonis wanted in Mawqaif to enlarge the focus of ''Shiʿr'' by addressing the politics and the illusions of the Arab nations after their defeat in the [[Six-Day War]], believing that literature by itself cannot achieve the renewal of society and that it should be related to a more comprehensive revolutionary movement of renovation on all levels.

A number of literary figures later joined and contributed to ''Mawaqif'', including [[Elias Khoury]], [[Hisham Sharabi]] and Palestinian poet [[Mahmoud Darwish]] among others.

Due to its revolutionary nature and free-thinking outlook, ''Mawaqif'' had to overcome some problems, including censorship by governments less open than Lebanon's, financial difficulties that its independent nature entailed, and the problems that came in the wake of the Lebanese War. However, in spite of these difficulties, it continued to be in print until 1994.<ref name="From 'Ali">Ahmad Sa'id to Adonis: A Study of Adonis's Controversial Position on Arab Cultural Heritage {{cite web|url= http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/ach/article/viewFile/6603/5189|title= A Study of Adonis's Controversial Position on Arab Cultural Heritage|access-date= 2015-06-08|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060058/http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/ach/article/viewFile/6603/5189|archive-date= 2016-03-04|url-status= dead}}</ref>

===''Al-Akhar''===
Adonis also founded and edited ''Al-Akhar'' (English: "The Other"), a magazine dedicated to publishing original content as well as numerous literary translations of contemporary essays on philosophy and Arabism.<ref>{{Cite web|title = أدونيس... عينه على "الآخر": في زمن التحوّلات والأسئلة المعلّقة|url = http://www.al-akhbar.com/node/15646|website = الأخبار|access-date = 2015-12-17}}</ref>  The magazine published myriad essays on contemporary Arab thought and interrogated the relationship between political and religious thought. It expressed concern with structural impediments to the spreading of progress and freedom in the Arab world, and included writers such as Ahmed Barqawi and Mustafa Safwan. The magazine was published in Beirut from 2011 to  2013.

The magazine contained essays and was published by the Syrian businessman [[Hares Youssef]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = حوار في فلسفة الاقتصاد ورؤى جديدة للمستقبل مع رجل يهزأ بالأنماط القائمة ويقول (الاقتصاد هو علم كيف لا يجب أن نعيش!!) الحارث يوسف: إذا لم يخلق الإنسان منظومة مالية جديدة و سليمة الأخلاق فلن يجد مخرجا من تخبطّه في أمواج بحر مصالحه الهائج...|url = http://www.syriandays.com/?page=show_det&select_page=72&id=37943|website = www.SyrianDays.com|access-date = 17 December 2015}}</ref>

}}

Published in 1961, this is Adonis's third book of poetry, "The Songs of Mihyar of Damascus" (or the Damascene in different translation) marked a definitive disruption of existing poetics and a new direction in poetic language. In a sequence of 141 mostly short lyrics arranged in seven sections (the first six sections begin with 'psalms' and the final section is a series of seven short elegies) the poet transposes an icon of the early eleventh century, Mihyar of Daylam (in Iran), to contemporary Damascus in a series, or vortex, of non-narrative 'fragments' that place character deep "in the machinery of language", and he wrenches lyric free of the 'I' while leaving individual choice intact. The whole book has been translated by [[Adnan Haydar (translator)|Adnan Haydar]] and Michael Beard as Mihyar of Damascus: His Songs (BOA Editions, NY 2008)

Some of the poems included in this collection:
* "Psalm"
* "Not a Star"
* "King Mihyar"
* "His Voice"
* "An Invitation to Death"
* "New Covenant"
* "The End of the Sky"
* "He Carries in His Eyes"
* "Voice"
* "The Wound"
And other poems.

}}

In 1970 Adonis published "A Time Between Ashes and Roses" as a volume consisting of two long poems 'An Introduction to the History of the Petty Kings' and 'This Is My Name' and in the 1972 edition augmented them with 'A Grave For New York.' These three astonishing poems, written out of the crises in Arabic society and culture following the disastrous 1967 Six-Day War and as a stunning decrepitude against intellectual aridity, opened out a new path for contemporary poetry. The whole book, in its augmented 1972 edition has a complete English translation by Shawkat M. Toorawa as A Time Between Ashes and Roses (Syracuse University Press 2004).

==="This Is My Name" (book)===
Written in 1969, the poem was first published in 1970 with only two long poems, then reissued two years later with an additional poem ("A Grave for New York"), in "A Time Between Ashes and Roses" collection of poems.

In the poem, Adonis, spurred by the Arabs' shock and bewilderment after the [[Six-Day War]], renders a claustrophobic yet seemingly infinite apocalypse. Adonis is hard at work undermining the social discourse that has turned catastrophe into a firmer bond with dogma and cynical defeatism throughout the Arab world. To mark this ubiquitous malaise, the poet attempts to find a language that matches it, and he fashions a vocal arrangement that swerves and beguiles.

The poem was the subject of wide study in the Arab literary community due to its mysterious rhythmic regime and its influence on the poetry movement in the 1960s and 70s after its publication.,<ref>[http://www.alittihad.ae/details.php?id=30800&y=2010&article=full (أدونيس.. اسمه لغم الحضارة – Translation from Arabic: Adonis .. his name is a culture mine]".

==="A Grave for New York" (poem)===
Also translated "The Funeral of New York", this poem was written after a trip to New York in 1971 during which Adonis participated in an international Poetry Forum. The poem was published by Actes Sud in 1986, nearly two decades before it appeared in English, and depicts the desolation of New York City as emblematic of empire, described as a violently anti-American,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1559&context=wwqr|title=The Funeral of New York is a violently anti-American long poem}}</ref> in the poem [[Walt Whitman]] the known American poet, as the champion of democracy, is taken to task, particularly in Section 9, which addresses Whitman directly.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1559&context=wwqr|title=Whitman and Lebanon 's Adonis- Roger Asselineau – Ed Folsom}}</ref>

|source= —Adonis, 1971<ref>Translation from french text: Tombeau pour New York published by Actes Sud in 1986</ref>
}}

Adonis wrote the poem in spring 1971 after a visit to the United States. Unlike his poem "The Desert", where Adonis presented the pain of war and siege without naming and anchoring the context, in this poem he refers explicitly to a multitude of historical figures and geographical locations. He pits poets against politicians, the righteous against the exploitative. The English translation of this long poem from Arabic skips some short passages of the original (indicated by ellipses), but the overall effect remains intact. The poem is made up of 10 sections, each denouncing New York City in a different way. It opens by presenting the beastly nature of the city and by satirizing the Statue of Liberty.

"A Grave for New York" is an obvious example of Adonis's larger project of reversing the Orientalist paradigm to re-claim what he terms 'eastern' values as positive.<ref>Michelle Hartman: A Grave for New York and New York 80: Formulating an Arab Identity through the Lens of New York, Institute of Islamic Studies, McGill University, Montreal, Canada</ref>

=== "Al-Kitab" (book)===
Arabic for "The Book", Adonis worked on this book, a three-volume epic that adds up to almost two thousand pages, from 1995 to 2003. In "Al-Kitab", the poet travels on land and through the history and politics of Arab societies, beginning immediately after the death of the prophet [[Muhammad]] and progressing through the ninth century, which he considers the most significant period of Arab history, an epoch to which he repeatedly alludes. Al-Kitab provides a large lyric-mural rather than an epic that attempts to render the political, cultural, and religious complexity of almost fifteen centuries of Arab civilization.
The book was translated to French by Houria Abdelouahed and published in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seuil.com/livre-9782021093308.htm|title=Le Livre II (al-Kitâb), Adonis, Littérature étrangère – Seuil|first=Editions|last=Seuil|work=Seuil.com|access-date=21 February 2017}}</ref>

==Literary criticism==

Adonis is often portrayed as entirely dismissive of the intellectual heritage of Arabic culture.<ref name=zaytoon>{{cite web|url=http://phdliterature.nd.edu/assets/133558/zaytoon_journal_2014_wajdi.pdf|title=Arabic Islamic Culture and the Challenge of Modernity: Adonis' Critique of Traditionalist Thought, Mohamed Wajdi Ben Hammed, University of Notre Dame|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525101128/http://phdliterature.nd.edu/assets/133558/zaytoon_journal_2014_wajdi.pdf|archive-date=2015-05-25}}</ref> Yet in al-Thābit wa-l-Mutaḥawwil (The Immutable and the Transformative), his emphasis on the plurality of Arabic heritage posits the richness of Arabic Islamic heritage and the deficiency of tradition as defined by imitation (taqlīd). He views culture as dynamic rather than immutable and transcendent, challenging the traditionalist homogenizing tendency within heritage.

In studying the Arabic cultural system, Adonis emphasizes that the concept of heritage construed as a unified repertoire based on a consistent cultural essence preconditions the rupture between this heritage and modernity.

Adonis's critique of [[Arab culture]] did not merely call for the adoption of Western values, paradigms, and lifestyles per Science, which has evolved greatly in Western societies, with its "intuitions and practical results," should be acknowledged as the "most revolutionary development in the history of mankind" argues Adonis. The truths that science offers "are not like those of philosophy or of the arts. They are truths which everyone must of necessity accept, because they are proven in theory and practice." But science is guided by dynamics that make it insufficient as an instrument for human fulfillment and meaning: science's reliance on transcending the past to achieve greater progress is not applicable to all facets of human activity. "What does progress mean in poetry?" asks Adonis. "Nothing." Progress in the scientific sense pursues the apprehension of phenomenon, seeking uniformity, predictability, and repeatability. As such, the idea of progress in science is "quite separate from artistic achievement." Poetry and the other arts seek a kind of progress that affirms difference, elation, movement, and variety in life.<ref name="Mounah Abdallah Khour">{{cite web |url=http://docplayer.net/4006297-Adonis-selected-poems.html|title="Adonis: Selected Poems" by Adonis; Translated by Khaled Mattawa Introduction, Mounah Abdallah Khour}}</ref>

==="The Static and the Dynamic" (book)===
{{quote box|align=right|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|
title=The Static and the Dynamic |
{{poemquote|
What we must criticize firstly is how we define heritage itself.
In addition to the vagueness of the concept, prevalent conformist thought defines
heritage as an essence or an origin to all subsequent cultural productions.
In my opinion, we must view heritage from the prism of cultural and
social struggles that formed the Arabs' history and, when we do, it
becomes erroneous to state that there is one Arabic heritage. Rather, there
is a specific cultural product related to a specific order in a specific period
of history. What we call heritage is nothing but a myriad of cultural and
historical products that are at times even antithetical}}

}}

In Arabic "Al-Thabit wa al-mutahawwil", the book full title is "The Static and the Dynamic: A Research into the Creative and the Imitative of Arabs", it was first published in 1973 till 1978 (still in print in Arabic, now in 8th edition) by Dar al-Saqi, the book is a four-volume study described in the under title as "a study of creativity and adheration in Arabs), Adonis started original writings on the project as a PhD dissertation while in [[Saint Joseph University]], in this study, still the subject of intellectual and literature controversy,<ref>[[:ar:الثابت والمتحول (كتاب)]]</ref> Adonis offers his analysis of Arabic literature, he theorizes that two main streams have operated within Arabic poetry, a conservative one and an innovative one. The history of Arabic poetry, he argues, has been that of the conservative vision of literature and society (al-thabit), quelling poetic experimentation and philosophical and religious ideas (al-mutahawil). Al-thabit, or static current, manifests itself in the triumph of naql (conveyance) over 'aql (original, independent thought); in the attempt to make literature a servant of religion; and in the reverence accorded to the past whereby language and poetics were essentially Quranic in their source and therefore not subject to change.

Adonis devoted much attention to the question of "the modern" in [[Arabic literature]] and society,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/666770/Al-Thabit-wa-al-mutahawwil|title=Encyclopædia Britannica- Al-Thābit wa al mutaḥawwil – Work by Adonis}}</ref> he surveyed the entire Arabic literary tradition and concludes that, like the literary works themselves, attitudes to and analyses of them must be subject to a continuing process of reevaluation. Yet what he actually sees occurring within the critical domain is mostly static and unmoving. The second concern, that of particularity (khuṣūṣiyyah), is a telling reflection of the realization among writers and critics throughout the Arabic-speaking world that the region they inhabited was both vast and variegated (with Europe to the north and west as a living example). Debate over this issue, while acknowledging notions of some sense of Arab unity, revealed the need for each nation and region to investigate the cultural demands of the present in more local and particular terms. A deeper knowledge of the relationship between the local present and its own unique version of the past promises to furnish a sense of identity and particularity that, when combined with similar entities from other Arabic-speaking regions, will illustrate the immensely rich and diverse tradition of which 21st-century litterateurs are the heirs.

==="An Introduction to Arab Poetics" (book)===
First published in January 1991, in this book, Adonis examines the oral tradition of the pre-Islamic poetry of Arabia and the relationship between Arabic poetry and the [[Quran]], and between poetry and thought. He also assesses the challenges of modernism and the impact of western culture on the Arab poetic tradition.

==Artwork==
Adonis started making images using calligraphy, color and figurative gestures around the year 2002,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/gallery/2012/feb/09/syria-poet-adunis-artworks|title=Syrian poet Adunis introduces his artworks – gallery – The Guardian Interview 2012}}</ref> in 2012 A major tribute to Adonis, including an exhibition of his drawings and a series of literary events was organized in The Mosaic Rooms in West London.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://mosaicrooms.org/event/a-tribute-to-Adunis|title=A Tribute To Adunis- The mosaic rooms}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

==Controversy==
===Expulsion from the Arab Writers' Union===
On 27 January 1995, Adonis was expelled from the [[Arab Writers Union]] for having met with Israelis at an [[UNESCO]] sponsored meeting in [[Granada]], [[Spain]], in 1993. His expulsion generated bitter debate among writers and artists across the Middle East. Two of Syria's leading writers, [[Saadallah Wannous]] and [[Hanna Mina]], resigned from the union in solidarity with Adonis.<ref>{{cite news|first=Youssef M.|last=Ibrahim|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/07/world/arabs-split-on-cultural-ties-to-israel.html|title=NYTimes: Arabs Split on Cultural Ties to Israel|work=The New York Times|date=7 March 1995}}</ref>

===Death threats===
A known critic of Islamic religious values and traditions, who describes himself as a non-religious person,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/WriterArticles/NewsContentP/18/122235/Books/Aboutus.aspx|title=Adonis: ISIS and Nusra didn't fall from the sky}}</ref> Adonis has previously received a number of death threats in consequence of his denouncement by the known Egyptian [[Salafi]] sheikh [[Mohamad Said Raslan]] who accused him of leaving his Muslim name (Ali) and taking a pagan name, in a circulated video<ref name=salafivideo>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edUMeDifY1c|title=They are the enemy so watch out from them (translation from Arabic)}}</ref> he accused him as well of being a warrior against [[Islam]] and demanded his books to be banned describing him as a thing and an [[infidel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhFv36FTNWM|title=This is the ignorant Adonis – Sheikh Mohamed Said Raslan (Translation from Arabic)}}</ref>

In May 2012, a statement issued on one of the [[Syrian opposition]]'s [[Facebook]] pages, supporters of the [[Syrian opposition]] argued that the literary icon deserved to die on three counts. First, he is Alawite. Second he is also opposed to the Muslim religion. Third, he criticizes the opposition and rejects foreign military intervention in Syria.<ref name="dailystar.com.lb">{{cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Culture/Books/2012/May-18/173770-intellectuals-blast-syrian-opposition-calls-for-adonis-death.ashx|title=Intellectuals blast Syrian opposition calls for Adonis' death}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.syriantelegraph.com/?p=12953|title=translation from Arabic to the title : a Syrian apposition group places Adonis on the "killing list" (Translation from Arabic)}}</ref>

===Call for book burning===
In 2013, Islamic scholar Abdelfetah Zeraoui Hamadache called for Adonis books to be burned<ref>Adonis: fatwa calling for burning my books in Algeria is shameful http://www.echoroukonline.com/ara/mobile/articles/189272.html{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>Les salafistes algériens du Front de la Sahwa en campagne contre "le parti de la France" http://www.huffpostmaghreb.com/2014/05/30/salafistes-algeriens-camp_n_5415386.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180921034417/http://www.huffpostmaghreb.com/2014/05/30/salafistes-algeriens-camp_n_5415386.html |date=2018-09-21 }}</ref> following a poem allegedly attributed to him, this came after the Salafi leader listened to the poem on social networks, he then issued a fatwa calling for burning Adonis' books in Algeria and in the Arab World.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://elhayat.net/article773.html|title=elhayat Article in Arabic titled (translation) "Hamadache judges Adonis as an infidel and calls for burning his books}}</ref>

The poem was later proven as counterfeit (the poem is very weak in linguistic structure and differ greatly from Adonis literary style) Adonis commented<ref>In a phone interview with "Echorouk Newspaper" published on 23 December 2013</ref>"I am sorry that I am discussing a counterfeiting at this level. I hope that the source of the so-called poem is published. This is a shame for an Islamic scholar, the Arabic language and the entire Arab poem heritage."

He added: "I am not sad about burning my books because this is an old phenomenon in our history. We are fighting to found a dialogue and a debate in a peaceful way. Founding differences in opinions is a wealth source. This counterfeiting humiliates Arabic."<ref>Adonis: fatwa calling for burning my books in Algeria is shameful http://www.echoroukonline.com/ara/articles/189272.html?print</ref>

===Arab Spring===
On 14 June 2011, amid the bloody crackdown on the Syrian uprising, Adonis wrote an open letter<ref>{{cite news|url=http://assafir.com/Article/241058|title=Adonis, "Open Letter to President Bashar al-Assad; Man, His Basic Rights and Freedoms, or the Abyss," As-Safir, Beirut, June 14, 2011}}</ref> to Syria's President [[Bashar al-Assad]] in the Lebanese newspaper [[As-Safir]]- "as a citizen" he stresses. Describing Syria as a brutal police state, he attacked the ruling [[Ba'ath Party]], called on the president to step down, and warned that "you cannot imprison an entire nation". He was nonetheless taken to task for addressing a tyrant as an elected president, and criticising the "violent tendencies" of some of his opponents.

{{quote|That's why I said I'm not like the revolutionaries" he says. "I'm with them, but I don't speak the same language. They're like school teachers telling you how to speak, and to repeat the same words. Whereas I left Syria in 1956 and I've been in conflict with it for more than 50 years. I've never met either Assad [Bashar or his father, Hafez]. I was among the first to criticise the Ba'ath Party, because I'm against an ideology based on a singleness of ideas.}}

Adonis said on the subject:

{{quote|What's really absurd is that the Arab opposition to dictators refuses any critique; it's a vicious circle. So someone who is against despotism in all its forms can't be either with the regime or with those who call themselves its opponents. The opposition is a regime avant la lettre." He adds: "In our tradition, unfortunately, everything is based on unity – the oneness of God, of politics, of the people. We can't ever arrive at democracy with this mentality, because democracy is based on understanding the other as different. You can't think you hold the truth, and that nobody else has it.}}

In August 2011, Adonis called in an interview in the Kuwaiti newspaper "Al Rai" for the [[Syrian President]] [[Bashar al-Assad]] to step down because of his role in the [[Syrian civil war]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.monstersandcritics.com/middleeast/news/article_1655371.php/Prominent-Syrian-poet-Adunis-calls-on-Assad-to-step-down|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120717114832/http://news.monstersandcritics.com/middleeast/news/article_1655371.php/Prominent-Syrian-poet-Adunis-calls-on-Assad-to-step-down|url-status=dead|archive-date=17 July 2012|title=Prominent Syrian poet Adunis calls on Assad to step down|work=Monsters and Critics|date=6 August 2011|access-date=6 August 2011}}</ref> He has also called upon the opposition to shun violence and engage in dialogue with the regime.<ref>[https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21580628-after-revolution-comes-slow-business-devising-machinery-change-long "Constitution-building: The long march"], "The Economist", 13 July 2013.</ref>

==Nobel Prize nomination==
A perennial contender for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], Adonis has been regularly nominated for the award since 1988.<ref name="McGrath"/> After winning Germany's major award the Goethe Prize in 2011, he emerged as a front runner to be awarded the Nobel Prize,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/27/adonis-nobel-prize-literature-favourite|title=Adonis declared Nobel prize for literature favourite|quote= After winning Germany's major award the Goethe prize earlier this year, Syrian poet Adonis has emerged as the frontrunner to be crowned Nobel literature laureate next month.}}</ref> but it was instead awarded to the Swedish poet [[Tomas Tranströmer]], with [[Peter Englund]], the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, commenting that there is no political dimension to the prize, and describing such a notion as "literature for dummies".<ref>{{cite news|first=Lorien|last=Kite|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/79136fb8-f046-11e0-96d2-00144feab49a.html|title=Sweden's 'buzzard' poet wins Nobel Prize|work=Financial Times|date=6 October 2011|access-date=6 October 2011|quote=Before Thursday's announcement, there had also been much speculation that the committee would choose to honor the Syrian poet Adonis in a gesture towards the Arab spring. Englund dismissed the notion that there was a political dimension to the prize; such an approach, he said, was "literature for dummies".}}</ref>

Adonis has helped to spread Tomas Tranströmer's fame in the Arab world, accompanying him on readings.<ref name="Al-Ahram">{{cite news|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/~/NewsContentP/18/23495/Books/Adonis-Transtromer-is-deeply-rooted-in-the-land-of.aspx|title=Adunis: Transtromer is deeply rooted in the land of poetry|work=[[Al-Ahram]]|date=6 October 2011|access-date=6 October 2011}}</ref> He also wrote an introduction to the first translation of Tranströmer's complete works into Arabic (published by Bedayat publishing house, translated by the Iraqi Kassem Hamady), stating that:

{{quote|Transtromer [''sic''] tries to present his human state in poetry, with poetry as the art revealing the situation. While his roots are deep into the land of poetry, with its classical, symbolic and rhythmic aspects, yet he cannot be classified as belonging to one school; he's one and many, allowing us to observe through his poetry the seen and unseen in one mix creating his poetry, as if its essence is that of the flower of the world.<ref name="Al-Ahram"/>}}

==Legacy and influence==
[[File:Adonis - Dayâ.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Dayâ as [[Wall poems in Leiden|wall poem in Leiden]] ]]
Adonis' poetry and criticism have been credited with "far-reaching influence on the development of Arab poetry," including the creation of "a new poetic language and rhythms, deeply rooted in classical poetry but employed to convey the predicament and responses of contemporary Arab society."<ref>Abdullah al-Udhari, trans., "Victims of a Map" [bilingual selection of poems by Mahmud Darwish, Samih al-Qasim, and Adonis] (London: Al Saqi, 1984), 87.</ref> According to Mirene Ghossein, "one of the main contributions of Adonis to contemporary Arabic poetry is liberty-a liberty with themes, a liberty with words themselves through the uniqueness of poetic vision."<ref>Mirene Ghossein, "Introduction" in Adonis, "The Blood of Adonis", translated from the Arabic by [[Samuel John Hazo]] (Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1971</ref>

Adonis is considered to have played a role in Arab modernism comparable to [[T. S. Eliot]]'s in English-language poetry.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/13/books/an-arab-poet-who-dares-to-differ.html|title=An Arab Poet Who Dares to Differ}}</ref> The literary and cultural critic [[Edward Said]], professor at [[Columbia University]], called him "today's most daring and provocative Arab poet". The poet [[Samuel John Hazo]], who translated Adonis's collection "The Pages of Day and Night," said, "There is Arabic poetry before Adonis, and there is Arabic poetry after Adonis."

In 2007, [[Arabian Business]] named Adonis No. 26 in its 100 most powerful Arabs 2007<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/100-most-powerful-arabs-2007-147830.html|title=100 most powerful Arabs 2007}}</ref> stating "Both as a poet and a theorist on poetry, and as a thinker with a radical vision of Arab culture, Adonis has exercised a powerful influence both on his contemporaries and on younger generations of Arab poets. His name has become synonymous with the Hadatha (modernism) which his poetry embodies. Critical works such as "Zamān al-shi'r" (1972) are landmarks in the history of literary criticism in the Arab world."

In 2017, the judges panel for the [[PEN/Nabokov Award]] cited "Through the force of his language, boldness of his innovation, and depth of his feeling, Ali Ahmad Said Esber, known as 'Adonis,' has helped make Arabic, one of the world's oldest poetic languages, vibrant and urgent. A visionary who has profound respect for the past, Adonis has articulated his cherished themes of identity, memory and exile in achingly beautiful verse, while his work as critic and translator makes him a living bridge between cultures. His great body of work is a reminder that any meaningful definition of literature in the 21st century must include contemporary Arabic poetry."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://pen.org/2017-pennabokov-award-achievement-international-literature/|title=2017 PEN/NABOKOV AWARD FOR ACHIEVEMENT IN INTERNATIONAL LITERATURE |work=pen.org |date=March 27, 2017 |access-date=March 27, 2017}}</ref>
