'''Maurice Baring''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OBE}} (27 April 1874 – 14 December 1945) was an English [[man of letters]], known as a dramatist, poet, novelist, translator and essayist, and also as a travel writer and war correspondent. During World War I, Baring served in the [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]] and [[Royal Air Force]].

==Life==
Baring was the eighth child, and fifth son, of [[Edward Charles Baring, 1st Baron Revelstoke|Edward Charles Baring]], first [[Baron Revelstoke]], of the [[Barings Bank|Baring]] banking family, and his wife Louisa Emily Charlotte Bulteel, granddaughter of the [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|second Earl Grey]]. Born in Mayfair,<ref>[http://entitycube.research.microsoft.com/p/maurice_baring.htm Maurice Baring] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120709214211/http://entitycube.research.microsoft.com/p/maurice_baring.htm |date=9 July 2012 }}</ref> he was educated at [[Eton College]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].<ref>{{acad|id=BRN893M|name=Baring, the Hon. Maurice}}</ref> After an abortive start of a diplomatic career, he travelled widely, particularly in Russia. He reported as an eye-witness of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] for the London ''[[Morning Post]]''.<ref>Mosley, Charles (2003). ''Burke's Peerage, Baronetage & Knightage'' (Vol. 3), p. 3324;<br />{{cite web |url=http://thepeerage.com/p14959.htm#i149582 |title=Major Hon.

At the start of [[World War I]] he joined the [[Royal Flying Corps]], where he served as assistant to [[David Henderson (British Army officer)|David Henderson]] and [[Hugh Trenchard, 1st Viscount Trenchard|Hugh Trenchard]] in France. Throughout the war he corresponded with Lady Juliet Duff, the widow of Sir Robin Duff, 2nd Baronet of Vaynol, who was killed on 16th October 1914 near Oostnieuwekirke while serving with the 2nd [[Life Guards (United Kingdom)|Life Guards]]. These letters were later published under the title of Dear Animated Bust: Letters to Lady Juliet Duff. In 1918, Baring served as a staff officer in the [[Royal Air Force]] and was appointed [[Order of the British Empire|Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] in the [[1918 Birthday Honours]]. In 1925 Baring received an honorary commission as a [[wing commander (rank)|wing commander]] in the Reserve of Air Force Officers. After his death, Trenchard wrote, "He was the most unselfish man I have ever met or am likely to meet. The Flying Corps owed to this man much more than they know or think."<ref name="Read">[[Piers Paul Read|Read, Piers Paul]] (2007). [http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/246306/whats-become-of-baring/ "What's become of Baring?"], ''The Spectator'', 10 October 2007. Reprinted in [https://web.archive.org/web/20110826002306/http://repository.shu.edu:8080/xmlui/handle/10420/103 ''Chesterton Review'', Spring-Summer 2008], pp. 309-311.</ref>

After the war he enjoyed a period of success as a dramatist, and began to write novels. He suffered from chronic illness during the last years of his life; for the final 15 years of his life he was debilitated by [[Parkinson's disease]].

He was widely known socially, to some of the [[Cambridge Apostles]], to [[The Coterie]], and to the literary group associating with [[G. K. Chesterton]] and [[Hilaire Belloc]] in particular.<ref>Pearce, Joseph. [http://www.catholicity.com/commentary/pearce/08500.html "Maurice Baring, In the Shadow of the Chesterbelloc,"] ''CatholiCity,'' 24 July 2010.</ref> He was staunch in his [[anti-intellectualism]] with respect to the arts, and a convinced [[practical joke]]r.

Previously an agnostic,<ref>Baring, Maurice (1910). [http://www.antiqbook.com/books/bookinfo.phtml?nr=1205450211&l=en&searchform= Letter dated 3 May 1910]</ref> he converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] in 1909, "the only action in my life which I am quite certain I have never regretted."<ref>Baring, Maurice (1922). ''The Puppet Show of Memory'', pp. 395-396.</ref> Speaking from personal experience, however, he once advised Belloc to "never, never, never talk theology or discuss the Church with those outside it. People simply do not understand what you are talking about and they merely (a) get angry and (b) come to the conclusion that one doesn't believe in the thing oneself and that one is simply doing it to annoy."<ref name="Read"/>

==Legacy==
Baring is remembered in verse in ''Belloc's Cautionary Verses:''

''Like many of the upper class''<br>
''He liked the sound of broken glass*''<br>
''* A line I stole with subtle daring''<br>
''From Wing-Commander Maurice Baring''

He once gave [[Virginia Woolf]] a copy of his book ''C''. She was not impressed, writing in her diary: "Second-rate art i.e. C., by Maurice Baring. Within its limits, it is not second rate, or there is nothing markedly so, at first go off. The limits are the proof of its non-existence. He can only do one thing; himself to wit; charming, clean, modest, sensitive Englishman. Outside that radius and it does not carry far nor illumine much, all is—as-it-should be—light, sure, proportioned, affecting even; told in so well-bred a manner that nothing is exaggerated, all related, proportioned. I could read this for ever, I said. L. said one would soon be sick to death of it".

The character, Horne Fisher, the protagonist of ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (book)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]'', a collection of detective stories by [[G.K. Chesterton]], "is generally thought to be based on Chesterton’s good friend, Maurice Baring." Although, while "Fisher fits Baring’s physical description, he is a respected member of the upper class, and he seems to know everybody and everything," the similarity ends there, Chesterton scholar, [[Dale Ahlquist]] notes: "By all accounts, the real Baring was a charming, affable gentleman who knew how to laugh and had no fear of making a fool of himself," while "Horne Fisher is distinctly lacking in both the charm and humour departments."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ahlquist |first1=Dale |title=Lecture 39: The Man Who Knew Too Much |url=https://www.chesterton.org/lecture-39/ |website=Chesterton.org |publisher=The American Chesterton Society |accessdate=15 June 2018}}</ref>
