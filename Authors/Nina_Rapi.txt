'''Nina Rapi''' ({{lang-el|Νίνα Ράπη}}) is a Greek award-winning playwright and short story writer. She has lived in London for many years but has recently returned to Greece and now lives in Athens.

== Style and themes ==
Rapi's writing focuses on power, desire and freedom. In an interview with ''The Scavenger'' she described her core themes in her latest trilogy of plays (''Angelstate''; ''Reasons to Hide''; ''Kiss the Shadow'') as being surveillance, censorship and power on the one hand, with intimacy, resistance and freedom on the other.<ref name=thescavenger>{{cite web|url=http://www.thescavenger.net/arts/interview-nina-rapi-082.html|title=Interview: Nina Rapi |website=Thescavenger.net|date=|access-date=4 February 2013}}</ref> In a more recent interview with Samuele Grassi, and regarding her aesthetic approach, she says: 'The place from which I write ''is'' very intimate and personal but the situations/dynamics, characters and stories I create are fictional and often intellectually worked out (the mental and the emotional are for me closely inter-linked.' & 'I do often use different media on stage, not only videos but live music and choreography...Text is of course primary.' <ref name="Nina Rapi/Samuele Grassi"/>  Lizbeth Goodman analysing ''Ithaka'', Rapi's first play, writes: 'It is this concept of transformative progressive freedom that provides the key to Nina Rapi's first play ''Ithaka'', a play that looks at the darker side of sexuality...' & '''Ithaka'' explores the concept that individuals are constantly subconsciously attracted to conflict and domination...Most important, ''Ithaka'' is a dark comedy – surreal in some aspects, bizzarely "realistic" in others. The tone of the piece is strikingly irreverent.' <ref>{{cite journal|last=Goodman|first=Lizbeth|title=Re-viewing Medusa|journal=Modern Drama|date=Spring 1996|volume=XXXIX|issue=1|url=http://www.utpjournals.com}}</ref> Samuele Grassi, analysing Rapi's more recent work (''Angelstate, Lovers, Tricky, Josie's Restrooms'') writes of 'Rapi's use of a multi-layered structure...focusing on freedom and/or desire as freedom.'<ref>{{cite book|last=Antosa|first=Silvia|title=Queer Crossings:theories, bodies, texts|year=2012|publisher=Mimesis|location=Italy|isbn=9788857509396|url=http://www.mimesisedizioni.it}}</ref>

== Plays ==
Nina Rapi's first play ''Ithaka'' was initially performed as a staged reading in 1989 at [[Riverside Studios]] by the Women's Theatre Workshop. Dimple Godiwala referring to Shadow, one of the key characters in the play, wrote: 'Shadow is where we begin to recognise the depths of sexuality (and otherness) we all possess...To invite an introspection which rests on the shadowed self we need to recognise that our sexualities, however they may have been moulded, are based on a certain opacity of self.' <ref>{{cite book|last=Godiwala|first=Dimple|title=Alternatives within the Mainstream II|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=9781847183064|url=http://www.c-s-p.org}}</ref>  The play went on to get published in ''Seven Plays by Women,'' Aurora Metro, winner of the Raymond Williams award, 1991;<ref>{{cite book|title=Seven Plays by Women|publisher=Aurora Metro|date=1991|isbn=0-9515877-1-4|url=http://aurorametro.com/newsite/products-page/play-collections/seven-plays-by-women-female-voices-fighting-lives/}}</ref> and to win Best Play Award at BITS Theatre Festival, Pirani, India, 1995.
