'''Octave Crémazie''' (April 16, 1827 – January 16, 1879) was a [[French Canadian]] poet and bookseller born in [[Quebec City]].<ref name="Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online">{{cite web|last=Robidoux|first=Réjean|title=Crémazie, Octave|url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=4923|work=Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online|publisher=University of Toronto/University of Laval|access-date=March 28, 2013}}</ref> Recognized both during and after his lifetime for his patriotic verse and his significant role in the cultural development of Quebec, Crémazie has been called "the father of French Canadian poetry."<ref name="Canadian Encyclopedia">{{cite encyclopedia|last=Condemine|first=Odette|title=Crémazie, Octave|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/octave-cremazie/ <!--Bot repaired link-->|encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=Historica Foundation|access-date=March 28, 2013}}</ref>

Octave was the youngest of the four surviving children of Jacques Crémazie and Marie-Anne Miville.<ref name="Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online" /> From 1836 to 1844, he was a student at the [[Seminary of Quebec]], where the priest John Holmes (American priest) introduced him to the works of the [[French romanticism#Romanticism|French Romantic writers]].<ref name="Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online" /> [[Alfred de Musset]], [[Alphonse de Lamartine]], and [[Victor Hugo]], in particular, had a profound influence on the future poet.<ref name="Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online" />

After finishing his studies at the Seminary of Quebec, Crémazie went into business with his brother Joseph, a bookseller.<ref name="Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online" /> Their shop in Quebec City, the ''J. et O. Crémazie'' bookstore,<ref name="Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online" /> was instrumental in the North American dissemination of works by many Romantic writers. It was also a meeting place for the members of what would become known as Quebec's literary movement of 1860.<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Canadian literature|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/91950/Canadian-literature/42337/The-literary-movement-of-1860|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online Academic Edition|access-date=March 28, 2013}}</ref>

While still in his early twenties, Crémazie helped found the [[Institut canadien de Québec|Institut canadien]], an organization devoted to the promotion of French Canadian culture.<ref name="Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online" /> He would later serve as the organization's president (from 1857 to 1858).<ref name="Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online" />

Crémazie's first published poems appeared in ''L'Ami de la religion et de la patrie'' (edited by his brother Jacques) and other Quebec City newspapers.<ref name="Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online" /> Recognition for his poetry grew throughout the 1850s. As [[Canadian Literature#French-Canadian literature|French-Canadian literature]] scholar Odette Condemine writes:

<blockquote>His nostalgic evocation of the happiness that preceded the Conquest and the miseries that followed roused his compatriots' fervour. "Le vieux soldat canadien" (1855) and "Le Drapeau de Carillon" (1858) were enthusiastically received and won Crémazie his title as "national bard."<ref name="Canadian Encyclopedia" /> </blockquote>

The longing for a glorious, vanished past and the sense of estrangement from France in Crémazie's work has prompted the critic Gilles Marcotte to describe it as a poetry of exile.<ref name="Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online" />

Despite the popularity of his bookstore, Octave Crémazie's extravagant taste for foreign commodities led to large debts and trouble with creditors.<ref name="Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online" /> By 1862, his financial situation had become so dire that he fled to France in secret, leaving the bookstore bankrupt.<ref name="Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online" /> He lived at different times in Paris, [[Bordeaux]], and [[Le Havre]] under the name of Jules Fontaine, poor and isolated despite having secured a modest job and the support of a few French friends.<ref name="Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online" />

Crémazie's poetic production stopped when he left Quebec.<ref name="Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online" /> The documents that survive from his later years include his ''Journal du siège de Paris'', a diary detailing the hardship that Parisians and Crémazie himself endured during the [[Siege of Paris (1870-1871)|siege of the capital]] in 1870 and 1871.<ref name="Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online" /> Many of his letters to close friends and family members also survive, including his correspondence with the priest [[Raymond Casgrain]],<ref name="Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online" /> to whom Crémazie often expressed his ideas about literature.

Octave Crémazie died in Le Havre on January 16, 1879.<ref name="Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online" />

''Œuvres complètes'', a volume of Crémazie's poems and letters edited by Raymond Casgrain, was published in 1882<ref name="Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online" /> by the Beauchemin bookstore<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/cihm_00332/page/n5/mode/2up|title=Œuvres complètes d'Octave Crémazie|publisher=Publiées sous le patronage de l'Institut canadien de Québec, Beauchemin et fils|year=1882|location=256 et 258, rue Saint-Paul. Montréal.|pages=[title page]}}</ref> in Montreal and the [[Institut canadien de Quebec|Institut canadien de Québec]]. The book included the following remarks: "In a word, the publishers wanted this book to stand as the most enduring monument that could be raised to the memory of the most patriotic, and indeed the most hapless, of our poets."{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/cihm_00332/page/n7/mode/2up|title=Œuvres complètes d'Octave Crémazie|publisher=Publiées sous le patronage de l'Institut canadien de Québec, Beauchemin et fils|year=1882|location=256 et 258, rue Saint-Paul, Montréal|pages=6}}</ref>

A statue depicting a French Canadian soldier stands in Montreal's [[Saint-Louis Square]] (Rue de Malines and Saint-Denis) with Crémazie's name across the top and the years 1827–1879 (his years of birth and death). Underneath the soldier are the words: ''Pour mon drapeau je viens ici mourir'' (literally: "For my flag I come here to die"). There is also a Montreal [[Crémazie (Montreal Metro)|metro station]] named for him on the [[Orange Line (Montreal Metro)|orange line]], located on the [[Crémazie Boulevard|boulevard]] likewise named in his honour.
