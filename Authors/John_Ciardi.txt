'''John Anthony Ciardi''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ɑːr|d|i}} {{respell|CHAR|dee}}; {{IPA-it|ˈtʃardi|lang}}; June 24, 1916 – March 30, 1986) was an American poet, [[translation|translator]], and [[etymologist]]. While primarily known as a poet and translator of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', he also wrote several volumes of children's poetry, pursued etymology, contributed to the ''[[Saturday Review (US magazine)|Saturday Review]]'' as a columnist and long-time poetry editor, directed the [[Bread Loaf Writers' Conference]] in [[Vermont]], and recorded commentaries for [[National Public Radio|National Public Radio]].

In 1959, Ciardi published a book on how to read, write, and teach poetry, ''How Does a Poem Mean?'', which has proven to be among the most-used books of its kind. At the peak of his popularity in the early 1960s, Ciardi also had a network television program on CBS, ''Accent''. Ciardi's impact on poetry is perhaps best measured through the younger poets whom he influenced as a teacher and as editor of the ''Saturday Review''.<ref name="hunter"/>

==Biography==
Ciardi was born at home in [[Boston]]'s [[North End, Boston, Massachusetts|North End]] in 1916.  His father, an Italian immigrant, died in an automobile accident in 1919, and he was raised by his Italian mother (who was illiterate) and his three older sisters. In 1921, his family moved to [[Medford, Massachusetts]], where he attended public schools.<ref name="NYTimes1"/> His family members saved enough money to send him to college{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}. He entered [[Bates College]] in [[Lewiston, Maine]], before transferring to [[Tufts University]] in Boston to study under poet [[John Holmes (poet)|John Holmes]].<ref name="NYTimes1"/> He graduated from Tufts in 1938, and the following year completed his MA at the [[University of Michigan]]. At Michigan he was awarded the [[Hopwood Award|Hopwood Prize]] for ''Homeward to America'',<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qhNYAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA182 |title = Quarterly Review: A Journal of University Perspectives|year = 1947}}</ref> a poetry collection which he submitted under the pseudonym "Thomas Aquinas".<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_HWNsvwhRWUC&pg=PA52 | title=John Ciardi: A Biography (p)| isbn=9781610752169| last1=Cifelli| first1=Edward M.| year=1997}}</ref>

Ciardi taught briefly at the [[University of Kansas City]] before joining the [[United States Army Air Forces]] in 1942, becoming a gunner on [[B-29 Superfortress|B-29s]] and flying some twenty missions over Japan before being transferred to desk duty in 1945.<ref name="LA1"/><ref name="NYTimes1"/>  He was discharged in October 1945 with the rank of Technical Sergeant and with both the [[Air Medal]] and [[Oak Leaf Cluster]].<ref name="NYTimes1"/> Ciardi's war diary, ''Saipan'', was published posthumously in 1988. After the war, Ciardi returned to UKC for the spring semester 1946, where he met and, on July 28, married Myra Judith Hostetter, a journalist and journalism instructor.<ref name="NYTimes1"/> Immediately after the wedding, the couple left for a third-floor apartment at Ciardi's Medford, Massachusetts home, which his mother and sisters had put together for the man of their family and his new bride.

John Ciardi was a longtime resident of [[Metuchen, New Jersey]].<ref name="NYTimes1">Boorstin, Robert O. [https://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F50717F83A5C0C718CDDAD0894DE484D81 " JOHN CIARDI, POET, ESSAYIST AND TRANSLATOR, 69"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 2, 1986. Accessed November 3, 2007. "Mr. Ciardi, who made his home in Metuchen, N.J., was 69 years old."</ref> He died on [[Easter|Easter Sunday]] in 1986 of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], but not before composing his own [[epitaph]]:<ref>{{cite web|title=John Ciardi Biography|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/john-ciardi|publisher=The Poetry Foundation|access-date=May 1, 2012}}</ref>

<poem>
:Here, time concurring (and it does);
:Lies Ciardi. If no kingdom come,
:A kingdom was. Such as it was
:This one beside it is a slum.
</poem>

==Literary career==
"After the war, Mr. Ciardi returned briefly to Kansas State, before being named instructor [in 1946], and later assistant professor, in the Briggs Copeland chair at [[Harvard University]], where he stayed until 1953."<ref name="NYTimes1"/> "While at Harvard, Mr. Ciardi began his long association with the [[Bread Loaf Writers Conference]] at [[Middlebury College]] in [[Vermont]], where he lectured on poetry for almost 30 years, half that time as director of the program."<ref name="NYTimes1"/>

Ciardi had published his first book of poems, ''Homeward to America'', in 1940, before the war, and his next book, ''Other Skies'', focusing on his wartime experiences, was published in 1947.  His third book, ''Live Another Day'', came out in 1949.  In 1950, Ciardi edited a poetry collection, ''Mid-Century American Poets'', which identified the best poets of the generation that had come into its own in the 1940s: [[Richard Wilbur]], [[Muriel Rukeyser]], [[John Frederick Nims]], [[Karl Shapiro]], [[Elizabeth Bishop]], [[Theodore Roethke]], [[Delmore Schwartz]], [[Randall Jarrell]], [[Robert Lowell]], Ciardi himself, and several others. Each poet selected several poems for inclusion, plus his or her comments on the poetic principles that guided the compositions, addressing especially the issue of the "unintelligibility" of modern poetry.

Ciardi had begun translating Dante for his classes at Harvard and continued with the work throughout his time there.  His translation of ''[[The Divine Comedy#Inferno|The Inferno]]'' was published in 1954. [[Dudley Fitts]], himself an important mid-century translator, said of Ciardi's version, "[H]ere is our Dante, Dante for the first time translated into virile, tense American verse; a work of enormous erudition which (like its original) never forgets to be poetry; a shining event in a bad age."<ref name="NYTimes1"/> [[Joan Acocella]] (née Ross), however, noted "The constant stretching for a heartier, more modern and American idiom not only vulgarizes; it also guarantees that wherever Dante expresses himself by implication rather than by direct statement, Ciardi will either miss or ignore the nuance."<ref>''The Cult of Language: A Study of Two Modern Translations of Dante.'' by Joan Ross Acocella. ''Modern Language Quarterly'' 1974 35(2):140–156; {{doi|10.1215/00182702-35-2-140}}. [http://mlq.dukejournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/35/2/140 dukejournals.org]</ref> The translation "is widely used at universities."<ref name="LA1"/> Ciardi's translation of ''[[The Divine Comedy#Purgatorio|The Purgatorio]]'' followed in 1961 and ''[[The Divine Comedy#Paradiso|The Paradiso]]'' in 1970. Ciardi's version of ''The Inferno'' was recorded and released by [[Folkways Records]] in 1954.  Two years later, Ciardi would have his work featured again on an album titled, ''As If: Poems, New and Selected, by John Ciardi.''

In 1953, Ciardi joined the English Department at [[Rutgers University]] in order to begin a writing program, but after eight successful years there, he resigned his professorship in 1961 in favor of several other more lucrative careers, especially fall and spring tours on the college lecture circuit, and to "devote himself fulltime to literary pursuits."<ref name="NYTimes1"/> (When he left Rutgers, he famously quipped that teaching was "planned poverty.") He was popular enough and interesting enough to warrant a pair of appearances in the early 1960s on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''. He was the poetry editor of the ''Saturday Review'' from 1956 to 1972. In 1962 Ciardi wrote an editorial critical of the government's efforts to censor [[Henry Miller]]'s ''[[Tropic of Cancer (novel)|Tropic of Cancer]]'', which the book's publisher [[Barney Rosset]], engaged in defense against legal action across the country, later acknowledged for its impact on public opinion, aiding the defense in the jury trials that followed.<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/1187/the-art-of-publishing-no-2-barney-rosset| title=Barney Rosset, The Art of Publishing No. 2| author= Ken Jordan| date=Winter 1997| journal=The Paris Review | volume=Winter 1997| issue=145}}</ref> He wrote the 1959 poetry textbook ''How Does a Poem Mean?''<ref name="LA1"/> Ciardi was a "fellow of the National Academy of Arts and Sciences and a member and former president of the National Institute of Arts and Letters."<ref name="LA1"/> He was one of the signers of the [[Humanist Manifesto II|Humanist Manifesto]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II |title=Humanist Manifesto II |publisher=American Humanist Association |access-date=October 7, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020110719/http://www.americanhumanist.org/humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II |archive-date=October 20, 2012 }}</ref>

For the last decade of his life, he reported on word histories on [[National Public Radio]]'s ''[[Morning Edition]]'', as an outgrowth of his series of books of etymologies, ''A Browser's Dictionary'' (1980), ''A Second Browser's Dictionary'' (1983) and ''Good Words to You'' (posthumously published in 1987). The weekly three-minute spot on etymology was called ''Word In Your Ear.''<ref name="LA1"/> He also taught at the [[University of Florida]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.english.ufl.edu/crw/ |title=Program in Creative Writing |publisher=English.ufl.edu |access-date=2014-07-27}}</ref>
 
Among 20th-century American men of letters, he maintained a notably high profile and level of popularity with the general public, as well as a reputation for considerable craftsmanship in his output. [[Burton Raffel]] summed up Ciardi's career: "Blessed with a fine voice, a ready wit, and a relentless honesty, Ciardi became in many ways an archetype of the existentially successful twentieth-century American poet, peripatetic, able to fit into and exploit chinks in the great American scheme of things, while never fitting in as either a recognized peg or hole."<ref name="hunter">{{cite book |last=Ciardi |first= John |volume= 129 |title= Introduction.

==Legacy==
Critic and poet [[Kenneth Rexroth]] described Ciardi as "... singularly unlike most American poets with their narrow lives and feuds. He is more like a very literate, gently appetitive, Italo-American airplane pilot, fond of deep simple things like his wife and kids, his friends and students, Dante's verse and good food and wine."<ref name="NYTimes1"/> "During his years at Bread Loaf and at the ''Saturday Review'', Ciardi established a reputation as a tough, sometimes harsh, critic."<ref name="NYTimes1"/> "His review of [[Anne Morrow Lindbergh]]'s 1956 book ''[[The Unicorn and Other Poems]]'' touched off what the ''Review's editor'', [[Norman Cousins]], described as ''the biggest storm of reader protest'' in the magazine's history."<ref name="NYTimes1"/> "Ciardi defended his stand, noting that it was ''the reviewer's duty to damn'' when warranted."<ref name="NYTimes1"/> In similar circumstances, Ciardi "described Robert Frost's 'Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening' as expressing the death wish of its speaker".<ref name=Encyclopedia>{{cite encyclopedia|title=John Ciardi 1916–1986|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of American Poetry: The Twentieth Century|publisher=Credo Reference}}</ref> [[May Sarton]], for example, accused Ciardi of "hat[ing her] guts and [of doing] everything he could to destroy [her]" in describing the difficulties faced by women poets.<ref>''First of all a poet; May Sarton; Renowned for her novels and journals, she treasures her poetry the most.'' Jack Thomas, Globe Staff. The Boston Globe. LIVING; Pg. 67. December 10, 1992.</ref>

Working for The ''Saturday Review'' while overseas, Ciardi sent Harold Norse's poem, "Victor Emmanuel Monument (Rome)", back to the U.S. to be published in the April 13, 1957 issue .<ref name=Cifelli>{{cite book|last=Cifelli|first=Edward M.|title=John Ciardi: A Biography|year=1997|publisher=University of Arkansas Press|location=Fayetteville|isbn=155728539X}}</ref>{{rp|p.223, 224}} The poem described Italian soldiers as flamboyant prostitutes.<ref name=Cifelli />{{rp|p.224}} In Ciardi's biography, Cifelli quotes several lines from the poem indicating that the soldiers were "all the brilliance of male panache", and "picking up extra cash from man and boy".<ref name=Cifelli />{{rp|p.224}} Ciardi was asked to leave by Italian officials by June 16.<ref name=Cifelli />{{rp|p.224}} Knowing that he could be arrested, he continued to write letters of apology to the government, asking for reprieve.<ref name=Cifelli />{{rp|p.224, 225}} Yet he refused to leave, as he was not scheduled to depart till later on in the summer.<ref name=Cifelli />{{rp|p.224, 225}}

Ciardi did not fare well in the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture of the late 1960s]] and 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} He had been a fresh, sometimes brash, voice for modern poetry, but as he approached his fiftieth birthday in 1966, he had become entrenched and his voice became bitter, sometimes bumptious. He urged his only remaining students, those at Bread Loaf for two weeks each August, to learn how to write within the tradition before abandoning it in favor of undisciplined, improvisational free verse.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Ciardi was unceremoniously fired from Bread Loaf in 1972, after serving seventeen years as director, and not having missed a single year on the poetry staff since 1947.

Over the past quarter century, John Ciardi has come to be regarded as a mid-level, mid-century formalist,{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} one who was replaced in literary history by the more daring and colorful [[Beat generation|Beat]], [[Confessionalism (poetry)|Confessional]], and [[Black Mountain poets]]. However, with revisionism chipping away at the reputations of the latter groups, and the emergence of [[Dana Gioia]] and the [[New Formalism|New Formalists]] in the late 20th century, Ciardi's type of mostly understated verse,{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} his work is much more culturally relevant than it once was.

In recognition of Ciardi's work, a John Ciardi Lifetime Achievement Award for Poetry is given annually to an Italian American poet for lifetime achievement in poetry.<ref>[http://www.pw.org/content/john_ciardi_lifetime_achievement_award ]{{dead link|date=July 2014}}</ref>

[[National Public Radio]] (NPR) continues to make Ciardi's commentaries available.  [[Etymology|Etymologies]] and commentary on words such as [[Daisy (disambiguation)|daisy]], [[demijohn]], [[Sprinkles|jimmies]], [[gerrymander]], [[glitch]], [[Military slang|snafu]], [[cretinism|cretin]], and [[baseball]], among others, are available from the archives of their website. NPR also began making his commentaries available as [[podcast]]s, starting in November 2005.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Awards==
"In 1956, Ciardi received the Prix de Rome from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In 1982, the National Council of Teachers of English awarded him its award for excellence in children's poetry."<ref name="LA1"/> He also won American Platform Association's Carl Sandburg Award in 1980.<ref>''NOTES ON PEOPLE; Wallace Heading Home to Alabama After Treatment.''
