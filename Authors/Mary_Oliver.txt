'''Mary Jane Oliver''' (September 10, 1935 – January 17, 2019) was an American [[poet]] who won the [[National Book Award]] and the [[Pulitzer Prize]]. Her work is inspired by nature, rather than the human world, stemming from her lifelong passion for solitary walks in the wild. It is characterised by a sincere wonderment at the impact of natural imagery, conveyed in unadorned language. In 2007, she was declared to be the country's best-selling poet.

==Early life==
Mary Oliver was born to Edward William and Helen M. (Vlasak) Oliver on September 10, 1935, in [[Maple Heights, Ohio]], a semi-rural suburb of [[Cleveland]].<ref Name="PoetryFound"/> Her father was a [[social studies]] teacher and an athletics coach in the Cleveland public schools. As a child, she spent a great deal of time outside where she enjoyed going on walks or reading. In an interview with the ''Christian Science Monitor'' in 1992, Oliver commented on growing up in Ohio, saying <blockquote>"It was pastoral, it was nice, it was an extended family. I don't know why I felt such an affinity with the natural world except that it was available to me, that's the first thing. It was right there. And for whatever reasons, I felt those first important connections, those first experiences being made with the natural world rather than with the social world."<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1992/1209/09161.html|last=Ratiner|first=Steve|date=December 9, 1992|title=Poet Mary Oliver: a Solitary Walk|journal=Christian Science Monitor|access-date=March 6, 2018}}</ref></blockquote> In 2011, in an interview with [[Maria Shriver]], Oliver described her family as dysfunctional, adding that though her childhood was very hard, writing helped her create her own world.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://www.oprah.com/entertainment/Maria-Shriver-Interviews-Poet-Mary-Oliver/3|title=Maria Shriver Interviews the Famously Private Poet Mary Oliver|work=Oprah.com|access-date=November 30, 2018|language=en-us}}</ref> Oliver revealed in the interview with Shriver that she had been sexually abused as a child and had experienced recurring nightmares.<ref name=":0" />

Oliver began writing poetry at the age of 14. She graduated from the local high school in Maple Heights. In the summer of 1951 at the age of 15 she attended the National Music Camp at [[Interlochen, Michigan]], now known as [[Interlochen Arts Camp]], where she was in the percussion section of the National High School Orchestra. At 17 she visited the home of the late Pulitzer Prize-winning poet [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]], in [[Austerlitz, New York|Austerlitz]], New York,<ref Name="PoetryFound">"[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poet.html?id=5130 Poetry Foundation Oliver biography]".

Retrieved September 7, 2010.</ref> where she then formed a friendship with the late poet's sister Norma. Oliver and Norma spent the next six to seven years at the estate organizing Edna St. Vincent Millay's papers.

Oliver studied at The [[Ohio State University]] and [[Vassar College]] in the mid-1950s, but did not receive a degree at either college.<ref  Name="PoetryFound"/>

==Career==

She worked at <nowiki>''Steepletop'', the estate of Edna St. Vincent Millay, as secretary to the poet'</nowiki>s sister.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Contemporary Authors|last=Stevenson|first=Mary Reif|publisher=Fredrick G. Ruffner Jr|year=1969|location=USA|pages=395}}</ref> Oliver's first collection of poems, ''No Voyage and Other Poems'', was published in 1963, when she was 28.<ref name="Beaconpress">Mary Oliver's bio at publisher Beacon Press (note that original link is dead; see version archived at https://web.archive.org/web/20090508075809/http://www.beacon.org/contributorinfo.cfm?ContribID=1299 ; retrieved October 19, 2015).</ref> During the early 1980s, Oliver taught at [[Case Western Reserve University]]. Her fifth collection of poetry, ''American Primitive'', won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for Poetry in 1984.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/01/17/arts/ap-us-obit-mary-oliver-.html|title=Pulitzer Prize-Winning Poet Mary Oliver Dies at 83|agency=Associated Press|date=January 17, 2019|work=The New York Times|access-date=January 17, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref Name="PoetryFound"/><ref name=pulitzer/> She was Poet In Residence at [[Bucknell University]] (1986) and Margaret Banister Writer in Residence at [[Sweet Briar College]] (1991), then moved to [[Bennington, Vermont]], where she held the Catharine Osgood Foster Chair for Distinguished Teaching at Bennington College until 2001.<ref Name="Beaconpress"/>

She won the Christopher Award and the [[L. L. Winship/PEN New England Award]] for her piece ''House of Light'' (1990), and ''New and Selected Poems'' (1992) won the [[National Book Award]].<ref name="PoetryFound" /><ref name="nba1992" /> Oliver's work turns towards nature for its inspiration and describes the sense of wonder it instilled in her. "When it's over," she says, "I want to say: all my life / I was a bride married to amazement. I was the bridegroom, taking the world into my arms." ("When Death Comes" from ''New and Selected Poems'' (1992).) Her collections ''Winter Hours: Prose, Prose Poems, and Poems'' (1999), ''Why I Wake Early'' (2004), and ''New and Selected Poems, Volume 2'' (2004) build the themes. The first and second parts of ''Leaf and the Cloud'' are featured in ''The Best American Poetry'' 1999 and 2000,<ref name="AAP" /> and her essays appear in ''Best American Essays'' 1996, 1998 and 2001.<ref name="Beaconpress" />

== Poetic identity ==
Mary Oliver's poetry is grounded in memories of [[Ohio]] and her adopted home of [[New England]], setting most of her poetry in and around Provincetown after she moved there in the 1960s.<ref name="Land" />  Influenced by both [[Walt Whitman|Whitman]] and [[Henry David Thoreau|Thoreau]], she is known for her clear and poignant observances of the natural world. In fact, according to the 1983 Chronology of American Literature, the "American Primitive," one of Oliver's collection of poems, "...presents a new kind of Romanticism that refuses to acknowledge boundaries between nature and the observing self."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://search-credoreference-com.lib.rockhurst.edu/content/entry/chronamlit/1983/0|title=The Chronology of American Literature|date=2004}}</ref> Her creativity was stirred by nature, and Oliver, an avid walker, often pursued inspiration on foot. Her poems are filled with imagery from her daily walks near her home:<ref name="Beaconpress" /> shore birds, water snakes, the phases of the moon and humpback whales. In ''Long life'' she says  "[I] go off to my woods, my ponds, my sun-filled harbor, no more than a blue comma on the map of the world but, to me, the emblem of everything."<ref name="Land" /> She commented in a rare interview "When things are going well, you know, the walk does not get rapid or get anywhere: I finally just stop, and write. That's a successful walk!" She said that she once found herself walking in the woods with no pen and later hid pencils in the trees so she would never be stuck in that place again.<ref name="Land" />  She often carried a 3-by-5-inch hand-sewn notebook for recording impressions and phrases.<ref name="Land" /> [[Maxine Kumin]] called Oliver "a patroller of wetlands in the same way that Thoreau was an inspector of snowstorms."<ref name="WRB">Kumin, Maxine. "Intimations of Mortality". ''Women's Review of Books'' 10: April 7, 1993, p. 16.</ref> Oliver stated that her favorite poets were [[Walt Whitman]], [[Rumi]], [[Hafez]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] and [[John Keats]].<ref name=":0" />

Oliver has also been compared to [[Emily Dickinson]], with whom she shared an affinity for solitude and inner monologues.  Her poetry combines dark introspection with joyous release.  Although she was criticized for writing poetry that assumes a close relationship between women and nature, she found that the self is only strengthened through an immersion with nature.<ref name="Graham">Graham, p. 352</ref> Oliver is also known for her unadorned language and accessible themes.<ref name="AAP">"[http://www.poets.org/moliv Oliver Biography]". Academy of American Poets. Retrieved September 12, 2012.</ref> The ''Harvard Review'' describes her work as an antidote to "inattention and the baroque conventions of our social and professional lives. She is a poet of wisdom and generosity whose vision allows us to look intimately at a world not of our making."<ref name="AAP" />

In 2007 ''[[The New York Times]]'' described her as "far and away, this country's best-selling poet."<ref name="Gardner2007">Garner, Dwight. (February 18, 2007.) "[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/18/books/review/18tbr.html?ref=paul_auster Inside the List]". ''New York Times''. Retrieved September 7, 2010.</ref>

==Personal life==
On a visit to Austerlitz in the late 1950s, Oliver met photographer [[Molly Malone Cook]], who would become her partner for over forty years.<ref name="Land" /> In ''Our World,'' a book of Cook's photos and journal excerpts Oliver compiled after Cook's death, Oliver writes, "I took one look [at Cook] and fell, hook and tumble." Cook was Oliver's literary agent. They made their home largely in [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]], where they lived until Cook's death in 2005, and where Oliver continued to live<ref name="AAP" /> until relocating to Florida.<ref>{{cite web|last=Tippett|first=Krista|date=5 February 2015|title=Mary Oliver — Listening to the World|url=http://www.onbeing.org/program/mary-oliver-listening-to-the-world/transcript/7271|access-date=6 September 2020|website=On Being}}</ref> Of Provincetown she recalled, "I too fell in love with the town, that marvelous convergence of land and water; Mediterranean light; fishermen who made their living by hard and difficult work from frighteningly small boats; and, both residents and sometime visitors, the many artists and writers.[...] M. and I decided to stay."<ref name="Land" />

Oliver valued her privacy and gave very few interviews, saying she preferred for her writing to speak for itself.<ref name="Beaconpress" />

== Death ==
In 2012, Oliver was diagnosed with [[lung cancer]], but was treated and given a "clean bill of health."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://onbeing.org/blog/mary-olivers-cancer-poem/|title=Mary Oliver's Cancer Poem|last=Helgeson|first=Mariah|date=16 February 2015|work=[[On Being]]|access-date=20 January 2019}}</ref> Oliver died of lymphoma on January 17, 2019, at the age of 83.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2019/01/17/577380646/beloved-poet-mary-oliver-who-believed-poetry-mustn-t-be-fancy-dies-at-83|title=Beloved Poet Mary Oliver Who Believed Poetry Mustn't Be Fancy Dies at 83|last=Neary|first=Lynn|date=17 January 2019|work=[[NPR]]|access-date=20 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/15/mary-oliver-obituary|title=Mary Oliver obituary|last=Parini|first=Jay|date=2019-02-15|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-02-18|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/mary-oliver|title=Mary Oliver|last=Foundation|first=Poetry|date=2019-05-07|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en|access-date=2019-05-08}}</ref>

== Critical reviews ==
Maxine Kumin describes Mary Oliver in the ''Women's Review of Books'' as an "indefatigable guide to the natural world, particularly to its lesser-known aspects."<ref name="WRB" /> Reviewing ''Dream Work'' for ''[[The Nation]]'', critic [[Alicia Ostriker]] numbered Oliver among America's finest poets: "visionary as [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]] [... she is] among the few American poets who can describe and transmit ecstasy, while retaining a practical awareness of the world as one of predators and prey."<ref name="PoetryFound" /> ''[[New York Times]]'' reviewer [[Bruce Bennetin]] stated that the Pulitzer Prize–winning collection ''American Primitive'', "insists on the primacy of the physical"<ref name="PoetryFound" /> while Holly Prado of ''Los Angeles Times Book Review'' noted that it "touches a vitality in the familiar that invests it with a fresh intensity."<ref name="PoetryFound" />

Vicki Graham suggests Oliver over-simplifies the affiliation of gender and nature: "Oliver's celebration of dissolution into the natural world troubles some critics: her poems flirt dangerously with romantic assumptions about the close association of women with nature that many theorists claim put the woman writer at risk."<ref name="Graham" />  In her article "The Language of Nature in the Poetry of Mary Oliver", Diane S. Bond echoes that "few feminists have wholeheartedly appreciated Oliver's work, and though some critics have read her poems as revolutionary reconstructions of the female subject, others remain skeptical that identification with nature can empower women."<ref>Bond, p. 1</ref> In ''The Harvard Gay & Lesbian Review'', Sue Russell notes that "Mary Oliver will never be a balladeer of contemporary lesbian life in the vein of [[Marilyn Hacker]], or an important political thinker like [[Adrienne Rich]]; but the fact that she chooses not to write from a similar political or narrative stance makes her all the more valuable to our collective culture."<ref>Russell, pp. 21–22.</ref>
