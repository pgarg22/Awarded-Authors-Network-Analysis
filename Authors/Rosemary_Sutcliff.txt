'''Rosemary Sutcliff''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CBE}} (14 December 1920 – 23 July 1992) was an English novelist best known for [[children's books]], especially [[historical fiction]] and retellings of myths and legends. Although she was primarily a children's author, some of her novels were specifically written for adults. In a 1986 interview she said, "I would claim that my books are for children of all ages, from nine to ninety."<ref name=taliesin/>

For her contribution as a children's writer Sutcliff was a runner-up for the [[Hans Christian Andersen Medal]] in 1974.<ref name=andersen/><ref name=ibby-nominee/>

==Biography==
Sutcliff was born 14 December 1920 to George Ernest Sutcliff and his wife Nessie Elizabeth, née Lawton, in [[East Clandon]], [[Surrey]].<ref name=degrummond/> She spent her childhood in [[Malta]] and various naval bases where her father, a [[Royal Navy]] officer, was stationed. She was affected by [[Juvenile idiopathic arthritis|Still's disease]] when she was very young, and used a wheelchair most of her life. Due to her chronic illness, Sutcliff spent most of her time with her mother from whom she learned many of the [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]] and [[Saxon]] [[legend]]s that she would later expand into works of historical fiction. Sutcliff's early schooling was constantly interrupted by moving house and her illness. She did not learn to read until she was nine years of age, and left school at age 14 to enter the [[Bideford Art School]], which she attended for three years, graduating from the General Art Course. Sutcliff then worked as a painter of [[Portrait miniature|miniatures]].
[[File:Treyford_Hill_South_Downs.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The [[South Downs]] near Sutcliff's long-time home in Sussex and the setting of several of her novels.]]
Inspired by the children's historical novels of [[Geoffrey Trease]], her first published book was ''The Chronicles of Robin Hood'' in 1950. In 1954, she published what remains her best-known work ''[[The Eagle of the Ninth]],'' part of a series on Roman Britain and its aftermath; they were not written as such or in sequential order but connected by the linking device of an emerald ring, passed down through generations of the same family. Between 1954 and 1958, Sutcliff's works ''The Eagle of the Ninth'', its sequel ''[[The Silver Branch (Sutcliff novel)|The Silver Branch]]'', ''[[Outcast (Sutcliff novel)|Outcast]]'' and ''[[Warrior Scarlet]]'' were runners-up in the annual [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]], given by the [[CILIP|Library Association]] to the year's best children's book by a [[British subject]]. She finally won the Medal for her third book in the ''Eagle'' series, ''[[The Lantern Bearers (Sutcliff novel)|The Lantern Bearers]]'' (1959).<ref name=medal1959/><ref name=ccsu/>{{efn |name=HC}} Where the first two books and one subsequent one were set in [[Roman Britain]], ''The Lantern Bearers'' immediately follows the [[end of Roman rule in Britain|withdrawal of the Roman Empire]], when the British people are threatened by remaining Germanic troops and by invaders.

Sutcliff was Carnegie runner-up again for her retelling of the [[Tristan and Iseult|Arthurian legend]] in ''[[Tristan and Iseult (novel)|Tristan and Iseult]]'', which in 1971 won the American [[Horn Book Award]]. In 1985, ''[[The Mark of the Horse Lord]]'' was the inaugural winner of the [[Phoenix Award]], created by the [[Children's Literature Association]] to recognise the best English-language children's book that did not win a major award when originally published twenty years earlier. It is named for the [[Phoenix (mythology)|mythical bird phoenix]], which is reborn from its ashes, to suggest the book's rise from obscurity.<ref name=phoenix/> ''The Shining Company'' won the same award in 2010.

Sutcliff lived for many years in [[Walberton]] near [[Arundel]], [[Sussex]]. In 1975, she was appointed an [[Order of the British Empire|Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] for services to children's literature, and later Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1992. She wrote incessantly throughout her life and was still doing so on the morning of her death in 1992.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.childlitassn.org/assets/docs/resources-2010_garner%201.pdf|website=www.childlitass.org |title=Sword Song as her "Swan Song": A Fitting Culmination of the Rosemary Sutcliff Legacy?|author=Barbara Carman Garner |publisher=Carleton University, Ottawa |access-date=29 May 2015 }}</ref> Sutcliff never married and had no children.
