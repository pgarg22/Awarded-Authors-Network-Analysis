'''Theofan Stilian Noli''', known as '''Fan Noli''' (6 January 1882 – 13 March 1965), was an [[Albanians|Albanian]] writer, scholar, diplomat, politician, historian, orator and founder of the [[Orthodox Church of Albania]], who served as [[List of Prime Ministers of Albania|Prime Minister]] and regent of [[Principality of Albania|Albania]] in 1924 during the [[June Revolution]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brisku|first=Adrian|date=2020|title=Renegotiating the Empire, Forging the Nation-State: The Albanian Case through the Political Economic Thought of Ismail Qemali, Fan Noli, and Luigj Gurakuqi, c. 1890–1920s|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/nationalities-papers/article/renegotiating-the-empire-forging-the-nationstate-the-albanian-case-through-the-political-economic-thought-of-ismail-qemali-fan-noli-and-luigj-gurakuqi-c-18901920s/E9D24BD6D209A847620DE7C0F21FE1D8|journal=Nationalities Papers|language=en|volume=48|issue=1|pages=158–174|doi=10.1017/nps.2018.52|s2cid=211344809|issn=0090-5992}}</ref>

Fan Noli is venerated in [[Albania]] as a champion of literature, history, theology, diplomacy, journalism, music and national unity. He played an important role in the consolidation of [[Albanian language|Albanian]] as the national [[Albanian language|language]] of [[Albania]] with numerous translations of world literature masterpieces.<ref name="Spahiu-Mjeku">{{harvnb|Spahiu|Mjeku|2009}}.</ref> He also wrote extensively in English: as a scholar and author of a series of publications on [[Skanderbeg]], [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], religious texts and translations.<ref name="Spahiu-Mjeku"/> He produced a translation of the [[New Testament]] in English, ''The New Testament of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ from the approved Greek text of the Church of Constantinople and the Church of Greece'', published in 1961.

Noli earned degrees at [[Harvard]]<ref name="Thernstrom"/> (1912), the [[New England Conservatory of Music]] (1938), and finally his Ph.D. from [[Boston University]] (1945).<ref>p. 175. William Paul. 2003. ''English Language Bible Translators''. Jefferson, NC & London: McFarland and Co.</ref><ref name="Skendi162"/> He was ordained a priest in 1908, establishing thereby the Albanian Church and elevating the Albanian language to ecclesiastic use. He briefly resided in Albania after the 1912 declaration of independence. After World War I, Noli led the diplomatic efforts for the reunification of Albania and received the support of US President [[Woodrow Wilson]]. Later he pursued a diplomatic-political career in Albania, successfully leading the Albanian bid for membership in the [[League of Nations]].

A respected figure who remained critical of corruption and injustice in the Albanian government, Fan Noli was asked to lead the 1924 June Revolution. He then served as prime minister until his revolutionary government was overthrown by [[Ahmet Zogu]]. He was exiled to Italy and permanently settled in the [[United States]] in the 1930s, acquiring US citizenship and agreeing to end his political involvement. He spent the rest of his life as an academician, religious leader, and writer.

==Background==

===Hudson Incident===
{{further|Hudson Incident}}

In Boston, some Albanian [[Christians]] were part of the [[Church of Greece|Greek Orthodox Church]], which was vehemently opposed to the Albanian nationalist cause. When a Greek Orthodox priest refused to perform the burial rites for Kristaq Dishnica, a member of the Orthodox Albanian community from [[Hudson, Massachusetts]], because of his nationalist activities, Noli and a group of Albanian nationalists in [[New England]] created the independent Albanian Orthodox Church.<ref name="Biernat1415">{{harvnb|Biernat|2014|pp=14–15}}.</ref><ref name="Skendi162"/> Noli, the new church's first clergyman, was [[ordained]] as a [[priest]] in 1908 by Archbishop [[Platon (Rozhdestvensky)]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Church]] in the United States under questionable circumstances.<ref name="Austin34">{{harvnb|Austin|2012|pp=3–4}}.</ref><ref name="Skendi162"/><ref name="Vickers61">{{harvnb|Vickers|2011|p=61}}.</ref> Through the creation of an independent church and Noli translating liturgy into Albanian, he hoped to diminish Greek influence in the church and counter Greek irredentism.<ref name="Austin4">{{harvnb|Austin|2012|p=4}}.

==Political and Religious activities==
{{Main|June Revolution}}
[[File:Fan Noli (i ri).jpg|thumb|200px|Portrait of a young Fan Noli.]]
In 1908, Noli began studying at Harvard, completing his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1912.<ref name="Austin4a"/> During April 1912 [[Vatra, the Pan-Albanian Federation of America|Vatra]] (Hearth) an [[Albanian Americans|Albanian American]] diaspora organisation was founded with Noli and [[Faik Konica]] serving as its leaders and advocating for Albanian sociopolitical self determination with the Ottoman Empire.<ref name="Skendi453">{{harvnb|Skendi|1967|p=453.}}</ref> He returned to Europe to promote Albanian independence, setting foot in Albania for the first time in 1913.<ref name="Austin4a"/> Noli returned to the United States during World War I, serving as head of the Vatra organization, which effectively made him leader of the Albanian diaspora.<ref name="Austin4a">{{harvnb|Austin|2012|p=4}}.</ref> His diplomatic efforts in the United States and [[Geneva]] won the support of President Woodrow Wilson for an independent Albania and, in 1920, earned the new national membership in the fledgling League of Nations.<ref name="Austin1820">{{harvnb|Austin|2012|pp=18, 20}}.</ref> Though Albania had already declared its independence in 1912, membership in the League of Nations provided the country with the international recognition it had failed to obtain until then.<ref name="Austin45">{{harvnb|Austin|2012|pp=4–5}}.</ref>

In 1921, Noli entered the Albanian parliament as a representative of the liberal pro-British "People's Party" ({{lang-sq|Partia e Popullit}}), the chief liberal movement in the country.<ref name="Austin32">{{harvnb|Austin|2012|p=32}}.</ref> The other parties were the conservative pro-Italian "Progressive Party" ({{lang-sq|Partia Përparimtare}}) founded by [[Mehdi Frashëri]] and led by Ahmet Zogu, and "Popular Party" ({{lang-sq|Partia Popullore}}) of [[Xhafer Ypi]]. The conservatives of Zogu would dominate the political scene.<ref>{{harvnb|Brisku|2013|loc=p. 75: "Two political groupings: the pro-British People's Party, headed by the colorful leader, Fan Noli, and the pro—Italian Progressive Party, led by Mehdi Frashéri, came to dominate the political scene."}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Bogdani|Loughlin|2009|loc=p. 122: "The first Albanian political parties, in the western meaning of the word, appeared in the early 1920s, the most prominent being: the Progressive Party led by Ahmet Zogu, the People's Party led by Fan Noli, and the Popular Party led by Xhafer Ypi."}}</ref> A [[Orthodox Congress, Albania|Congress of Berat]] in 1922 was convened to formally lay the foundations of an Albanian Orthodox Church which [[consecrated]] Fan Noli as [[Bishop]] of Korçë and primate of all Albania while the establishment of the church was seen as important for maintaining Albanian national unity.<ref name="Biernat1415"/><ref name="Austin3195">{{harvnb|Austin|2012|pp=31, 95}}.</ref>

==Downfall and exile==

[[File:Fan Noli 1939.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Bishop Fan Noli, founder of the [[Orthodox Autocephalous Church of Albania]] (1939).]]
Despite his efforts to reform the country, Noli's "Twenty Point Program" was unpopular, and his government was overthrown by groups loyal to Zogu on [[Christmas Eve]] of that year.<ref name="Austin59748082146150">{{harvnb|Austin|2012|pp=59–74, 80–82, 146–150}}.</ref>   Two weeks later, Zogu returned to Albania, and Noli fled to Italy under sentence of death.<ref name="Austin152155">{{harvnb|Austin|2012|pp=152–155}}.</ref>

Conscious of his fragile position, Zogu took drastic measures to consolidate his reassert in power. By the end of winter, two of the main leaders of the opposition, [[Bajram Curri]] and [[Luigj Gurakuqi]], were assassinated, while others were imprisoned. Noli founded the "National Revolutionary Committee" ({{lang-sq|Komiteti Nacional Revolucionar}}) also known as [[KONARE]] in [[Vienna]]. The committee published the periodical called "National Freedom" ({{lang-sq|Liria Kombëtare}}). Some of the early Albanian communists as [[Halim Xhelo]] or [[Riza Cerova]] would start their publishing activities here. The committee aimed in overthrowing Zogu and his cast and restoring democracy. Despite the efforts, the committee's access and influence in Albania would be limited. With the intervention of [[Kostandin Boshnjaku|Kosta Boshnjaku]], an old communist and [[KONARE]] member, the organization would receive unconditioned monetary support from the [[Comintern]]. Also Noli and Boshnjaku would make possible for exile members of the [[Committee for the National Defence of Kosovo]] (outlawed by Zogu) to get the same financial support.<ref>{{harvnb|Vllamasi|Verli|2000|loc="Një pjesë me rëndësi e emigrantëve, me inisiativën dhe ndërmjetësinë e Koço Boshnjakut, u muarrën vesh me "Cominternin", si grup, me emër "KONARE" (Komiteti Revolucionar Kombëtar), për t'u ndihmuar pa kusht gjatë aktivitetit të tyre nacional, ashtu siç janë ndihmuar edhe kombet e tjerë të vegjël, që ndodheshin nën zgjedhë të imperialistëve, për liri e për pavarësi. Përveç kësaj pjese, edhe emigrantët kosovarë irredentistë, të grupuar e të organizuar nën emrin "Komiteti i Kosovës", si grup, u ndihmuan edhe ata nga "Cominterni"."}}</ref>
 
In 1928, KONARE changed its name to "Committee of National Liberation" ({{lang-sq|Komiteti i Çlirimit Kombëtar}}). Meanwhile, in Albania, after three years of republican regime, the "National Council" declared Albania a [[Constitutional Monarchy]], and Ahmet Zogu became king.<ref>{{harvnb|Ersoy|Górny|Kechriotis|2010|p=155}}.</ref>
Noli moved back to the United States in 1932 and formed a republican opposition to Zogu, who had since proclaimed himself "King Zog I". Over the next years, he continued his education, studying and later teaching [[Byzantine music]], and continued developing and promoting the [[autocephalous]] Albanian Orthodox Church he had helped to found. While in exile, he briefly allied with King Zog, who fled Albania before the invading Italians in 1939, but was unable to set a firm anti-Axis, anti-Communist front.

After the war, Noli established some ties with the communist government of [[Enver Hoxha]], which seized power in 1944. He unsuccessfully urged the U.S. government to recognize the regime, but Hoxha's increasing persecution of all religions prevented Noli's church from maintaining ties with the Orthodox hierarchy in Albania. Despite the Hoxha regime's [[anticlericalism|anticlerical]] bent, Noli's ardent Albanian nationalism brought the bishop to the attention of the U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]. The FBI's Boston office kept the bishop under investigation for more than a decade with no final outcome to the probe.

In 1945, Fan S. Noli received a doctor's degree (Ph.D.) in history from [[Boston University]],<ref name="Skendi162">{{harvnb|Skendi|1967|p=162}}.</ref> writing a dissertation on [[Skanderbeg]].<ref name="Austin155">{{harvnb|Austin|2012|p=155}}.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/georgecastriotis00noli|title=George Castrioti Scanderbeg (1405-1468)|first=Fan Stylian|last=Noli|date=21 February 2018|access-date=21 February 2018|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> In the meantime, he also conducted research at Boston University Music Department, publishing a biography on [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]. He also composed a one-movement symphony called ''Scanderbeg'' in 1947. Toward the end of his life, Noli retired to [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]], where he died in 1965. The branch of the Albanian Orthodox Church that he had governed eventually became the [[Orthodox Church in America Albanian Archdiocese|Albanian Archdiocese]] of the [[Orthodox Church in America]].

[[File:AlbaniaP62-100Leke-1996-dab f.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Noli on a 1996 100 Lekë banknote.]]
Writing in his diary two days after Noli's death, Albanian leader Enver Hoxha gave his analysis of Noli's work:<ref>{{cite web|last=Hoxha|first=Enver|title=Ditar: 1965|url=http://enver-hoxha.net/content/content_shqip/librat/ditari_politik/ditar_7.htm|location=Tirana|publisher=8 Nëntori Publishing House|year=1989|pages=172–174}}</ref>
{{Quote|text=As we are informed, Fan S. Noli died from an operation done last week in which, because of his age, he did not survive. A cerebral hemorrhage caused a quick death. Noli was one of the prominent political and literary figures of the beginning of this century. The balance sheet of his life was positive&nbsp;... Fan Noli today enjoys a great popularity in our country, deserved as a literary translator and music critic. He was a prominent promoter of the Albanian language. His original works and translations, especially of [[Shakespeare]], of [[Omar Khayyám]] and [[Vicente Blasco Ibáñez|Blasco Ibáñez]], are immortal. But especially his anti-Zogist, anti-feudal elegies and poems are beautiful jewels that have inspired and will inspire our youth, especially in creativity. He was also respected as a realistic politician, as a revolutionary democrat in ideology and politics. [[Party of Labour of Albania|The Party]] has assessed the figure of Noli. As is deserved, we have had a patriotic duty to point out the really great merits of his in literature, the history of the arts, and his merits and weaknesses in politics. I think we will do our best in bringing his body to Albania, as this distinguished son of the people, the revolutionary patriot, deserves to bask in his homeland, which he loved and fought for his entire life.|sign=Enver Hoxha}}
