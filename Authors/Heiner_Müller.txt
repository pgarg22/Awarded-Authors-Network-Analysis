'''Heiner Müller''' ({{IPA-de|haɪnɐ mʏlɐ|lang}}; 9 January 1929 – 30 December 1995) was a German (formerly [[German Democratic Republic|East German]]) [[dramatist]], poet, writer, essayist and theatre director. His "enigmatic, fragmentary pieces" are a significant contribution to [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] drama and [[postdramatic theatre]].<ref name="gush">"With Beckett's death Müller becomes the theatre's greatest living poet." ''[[The Village Voice]]'', quoted on the backcover of Müller's ''Theatremachine'' (1995). The phrase "enigmatic and fragmentary pieces" comes from the article on Müller in ''The Cambridge Guide to Theatre'' (Banham 1995, 765). Among others, Elizabeth Wright assesses Müller's contribution to a postmodern drama in ''Postmodern Brecht'' (1989).</ref>

==Biography==
Müller was born in [[Eppendorf, Saxony]]. He joined the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] in 1946 which was in the course of the forced [[merger of the KPD and SPD]] subsumed into the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] (Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands, SED). He was soon expelled for lacking enthusiasm and failing to pay dues. In 1954 he became member of the German Writers' Association ([[Deutscher Schriftstellerverband]]). Müller became one of the most important dramatists of the [[German Democratic Republic]] and won the [[Heinrich Mann Prize]] in 1959 and the [[Kleist Prize]] in 1990.

His relationship with the East German state began to deteriorate, however, with his drama ''{{ill|Die Umsiedlerin|de|Die Umsiedlerin oder Das Leben auf dem Lande}}'' (''The Resettler Woman'') which was censored in 1961 after only one performance. Müller was expelled from the Writers' Association in the same year. The East German government remained wary of Müller in subsequent years, preventing the premiere of ''Der Bau'' (''Construction Site'') in 1965 and censoring his ''{{ill|Mauser (play)|lt=Mauser|de|Mauser (Drama)}}'' in the early 1970s. Yet despite these hardships, Müller's work began to gain popularity both in West Germany and internationally at this time. Many of his best-known plays from this period were premiered in the West: this includes ''Germania Death in Berlin'', which was first performed in 1978 at the [[Munich Kammerspiele]]. Heiner Müller himself directed a production of ''[[The Mission (play)|The Mission]]'' (''Der Auftrag'') in [[Bochum]] in 1982. In Paris, {{ill|Jean Jourdheuil|fr}} directed the world premiere of ''[[Die Hamletmaschine]]'' (''The Hamletmachine'') in 1979. English translations, first by Helen Fehervary and Marc Silberman, then by [[Carl Weber (theatre director)|Carl Weber]], introduced Müller to the English speaking world in the mid- and late 1970s; Müller's controversial play ''Mauser'' was first performed in 1975 in [[Austin, Texas]].<ref>The history of Müller's plays in production can be found in the ''Heiner Müller Handbuch'', edited by {{ill|Hans-Thies Lehmann|de}}.</ref>

On 17 November 1976, Müller signed together with eleven other writers and artists the petition against the expatriation of [[Wolf Biermann]]. Like several others of the signatories, Müller withdrew his signature on 25 November,<ref>"Die Ausbürgerung" by [[Wolf Biermann]], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', No. 45, 4 November 2001. pp. 60–78, Müller's withdrawal on p. 68</ref> according to Biermann on the condition that the [[Stasi]] would keep it secret.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/print-wams/article616970/Wolf-du-faehrst-im-Stasi-Stil-2.html |title="Wolf, du fährst im Stasi-Stil" (2)|author=Axel Brüggemann|work=[[Die Welt]] |date=11 November 2001 |access-date=4 April 2021}}</ref>

Due to his growing worldwide fame, Müller was able to regain acceptance in East Germany. He was admitted to the DDR [[Academy of Arts, Berlin]] in 1984 – only two years before he became a member of parallel West Berlin academy. Despite earlier honors, Müller was not readmitted to the East German Writers' Association until 1988, shortly before the end of the GDR. After the fall of the Wall, Müller became final president of the DDR Academy of the Arts from 1990 until its 1993 merger with the western academy.

In 1993 it was alleged that Müller worked from 1979 to 1990 as [[unofficial collaborator]] (an [[informant]]) under the code name "Heiner" for the East-German [[Stasi]].<ref name=taz>{{cite web|url=https://taz.de/!1634951/|title=Neue schwere Vorwürfe gegen Heiner Müller|author=ES|work=[[Die Tageszeitung]]|language=de|date=15 January 1993|access-date=4 April 2021}}</ref> Müller, who at the time was not a member of the [[East German Communist Party]] or the East German [[Deutscher Schriftstellerverband]], admitted that he had contact with Stasi officials, but never provided any material.<ref name=taz /><ref>[https://www.spiegel.de/kultur/vieles-ist-moeglich-a-3ff60e73-0002-0001-0000-000013679905 "Vieles ist möglich"], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', 17 January 1993</ref><ref>[https://www.hdg.de/lemo/biografie/heiner-mueller.html "Heiner Müller 1929–1995"], {{ill|Lebendiges Museum Online|de}} (in German)</ref>

In 1992, he was invited to join the directorate of the [[Berliner Ensemble]], [[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]]'s former company at the [[Theater am Schiffbauerdamm]], as one of its five members along with [[Peter Zadek]], [[Peter Palitzsch]], {{ill|Fritz Marquardt|de}} and {{ill|Matthias Langhoff|de}}. In 1995, shortly before his death, Müller was appointed as the theatre's sole artistic director.{{sfn|Weber|2001|pp=243–244}}

[[File:tombstone Heiner Mueller.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Heiner Müller's grave in Berlin]]
During the last five years of his life, Müller continued to live in Berlin and work all over Germany and Europe, mostly directing productions of his own works. He wrote few new dramatic texts in this time, though, like Brecht, he did produce much poetry in his final years. In the last half-decade of his life, Müller also worked towards transforming the interview into a literary genre. Müller died in Berlin of [[Head and neck cancer|throat cancer]] in 1995. Müller is buried at Berlin's [[Dorotheenstadt Cemetery]]. Müller's grave was designed by his last stage designer [[Mark Lammert]].

Among his better known works, other than those already mentioned, are ''Der Lohndrücker'' (''The Scab''), ''Wolokolamsker Chaussee'' (''Volokolamsk Highway'') Parts I–V, ''Verkommenes Ufer Medeamaterial Landschaft mit Argonauten'' (''Despoiled Shore Medea Material Landscape with Argonauts''), ''Philoktet'' (''Philoctetes''), ''Zement'' (''Cement''), ''Bildbeschreibung'' (''Description of a Picture'' aka ''Explosion of a memory'') and ''Quartett''.

Müller died at the age of 66 in a hospital in Berlin on December 30, 1995.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/03/nyregion/heiner-muller-the-playwright-and-social-critic-dies-at-66.html|title=Heiner Muller, the Playwright And Social Critic, Dies at 66|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Eric Pace|date=January 3, 1996}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Over a decade after his death, Müller continues to have an enormous influence on European playwriting, dramaturgy, and performance. In 1998, the journal [[New German Critique]] devoted a special issue to his work. He is the only playwright to have ever received such an honor.<ref name="thelocal.de">{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.de/opinion/20090109-16655.html |title=Happy birthday Heiner Müller – The Local |publisher=Thelocal.de |access-date=11 February 2014}}</ref> In 2009, one of Europe’s leading intellectual publishing houses, [[Suhrkamp]], issued the final three volumes in a twelve-volume edition of Müller's collected works.

Müller has also paved the way for a new generation of directors, playwrights, and [[dramaturgs]] who regard themselves as "samplers".<ref>"80 Years of Heiner Müller: No Drama on Earth" by Jürgen Berger, translated by Eileen Flügel, [[Goethe-Institut]], 2009. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422090207/http://www.goethe.de/kue/the/thm/idd/en4080155.htm |date=22 April 2009 }}</ref> Müller adopted Brecht's notion of ''Kopien'' (German for "copying"), the practice of regarding texts by others as material to be used, imitated, and rewritten. In regards to Brecht's own oeuvre, Müller stated "To use Brecht without criticizing him is treason."<ref name="thelocal.de"/> For Müller, the work of other writers and artists was not seen as private property; it was to be used as raw material for his own work. Thus, Müller's work in the theater marks the beginning of a tradition of densely poetic dramaturgy based in the logic of association, rather than linear "dramatic" narrative.

[[Jonathan Kalb]], theater critic for ''[[The New York Times]]'', describes Müller's legacy on theatre as replacing the "closed" didactical form of the Brechtian [[parable]] with "open" dramatic forms offering multiple meanings based, in Hans-Thies Lehmann's words, on a [[Surrealism|surreal]] "montage dramaturg ... in which the reality-level of characters and events vacillates hazily between life and dream and the stage becomes a hotbed of spirits and quotes outside any homogeneous notion of space and time."{{sfn|Kalb|2001|p=19}} In reference to Müller, [[Tony Kushner]] declared, "Write into the void, learn to embrace isolation, in which we may commence undistractedly our dreadful but all-important dialogue with the dead. Forget about love and turn your face to history."<ref>[[Tony Kushner]]'s foreword to ''A Heiner Müller Reader"</ref> With Müller's work, theater is a forum for examining history; it is "a dialogue with the dead".
