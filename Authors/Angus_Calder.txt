'''Angus Lindsay Ritchie Calder''' (5 February 1942 – 5 June 2008) was a Scottish writer, historian, and poet. Initially studying English literature, he became increasingly interested in [[political history]] and wrote a landmark study on Britain during the [[Second World War]] in 1969 entitled ''The People's War''. He subsequently wrote several other historical works but became increasingly interested in literature and poetry and worked primarily as a writer, though often holding a number of university teaching positions. A [[socialist]], he was a prominent Scottish [[public intellectual]] during the 1970s and 1980s.

==Early life==
Angus Calder was born in [[London]] on 5 February 1942 into a prominent [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] family from [[Scotland]].{{sfn|The Guardian|2008}} His father was [[Peter Ritchie Calder|Ritchie Calder]] (1906–1982), a noted [[socialist]] and [[pacifist]] who became famous for his work as a [[journalist]] and [[science writer]]. His siblings are [[Nigel Calder]], mathematician Allan Calder, educationist Isla Calder (1946–2000) and teacher Fiona Rudd (née Calder). His nephew is travel writer and journalist [[Simon Calder]].

Angus Calder read English literature at [[King's College, Cambridge]]. He gained a doctorate from the [[University of Sussex]] in 1968 on [[politics in the United Kingdom]] during [[World War II]], entitled "The Common Wealth Party, 1942–45" which studied the [[Common Wealth Party|political party of the same name]]. At the time, academic research into the conflict was rare as government papers were not available under the [[Thirty-year rule#United Kingdom|fifty-year rule]]. As a result Calder worked closely with [[Paul Addison]] (1943–2020), another historian with similar research interests.{{sfn|Addison|2010|p=300}} Together Addison and Calder made extensive use of the newly discovered archives of [[Mass-Observation]] to examine British public opinion. Calder was instrumental in creating the Mass-Observation Archive at Sussex in 1970, in collaboration with [[Asa Briggs]].{{sfn|Addison|2010|p=301}}

==''The People's War''==
Calder had been commissioned to write a general history of the [[United Kingdom home front during World War II|British Home Front]] by the publisher [[Jonathan Cape]] while still working on his PhD thesis. This led to ''The People's War'', first published in 1969. The work was academic in tone and ranged widely across the political and social history of the period. It was critical of enduring propaganda myths without being polemic, and was extremely successful. It has subsequently been described as "groundbreaking".{{sfn|Addison|2010|pp=301-2}}{{sfn|The Financial Times|2008}} As Addison summarised:

{{quote|In order to wage the war, Angus argued, the prewar ruling class had been compelled to mobilize the people. During the first half of the war they had effectively displaced their former rulers and taken charge of the war themselves. It became the People's War, a 'ferment of participatory democracy', exemplified by the way in which Londoners, acting in defiance of the government, had turned underground tube stations into deep shelters. During the second half of the war, however, the 'forces of wealth, bureaucracy and privilege' began to regroup and recover the authority they had lost.{{sfn|Addison|2010|p=302}} }}

''The People's War'' was well received and won the [[John Llewellyn Rhys Prize]], a [[literary award]].{{sfn|The Guardian|2008}} Though its thesis was not widely adopted in academia, it proved extremely influential as [[popular history]]. [[Richard Eyre]] said that he "could name about twenty works, films, television and theatre which have emerged essentially from Angus Calder's book".{{sfn|Addison|2010|p=303}} Among those who were said to have been influenced by the work were the playwright [[David Hare (playwright)|David Hare]] and future prime minister [[Gordon Brown]].{{sfn|The Financial Times|2008}} It remains in print.

Calder increasingly began to doubt his own thesis over the following decades. Many of his original conclusions were revised in his ''The Myth of the Blitz'' (1991). According to Addison, this reassessment was encouraged by Calder's revulsion with the [[jingoism|jingoistic nationalism]] which accompanied the [[Falklands War|Falklands War of 1982]] and [[Thatcherism]]. Both were partly inspired by the [[collective memory]] of the "People's War" which Calder had himself popularised.{{sfn|Addison|2010|p=303}}

==Literature and poetry==
Following his success with ''The People's War'', Calder increasingly returned to his interests in [[literature]] and poetry. In 1971, he moved to [[Edinburgh]] where he published ''Russia Discovered'', a survey of 19th-century Russian fiction in 1976, and, three years later, became staff tutor in Arts with the [[Open University]]. He subsequently taught all over the world, lecturing in literature at several African universities and serving from 1981 to 1987 as co-editor of the ''[[Journal of Commonwealth Literature]]''.<ref name=Independent>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/angus-calder-historian-critic-and-poet-whose-the-peoples-war-challenged-conventional-wisdom-on-wartime-britain-843573.html|title=Angus Calder: Historian, critic and poet whose 'The People's War' challenged conventional wisdom on wartime Britain|newspaper=The Independent|author=Ian Campbell|date=10 June 2008|access-date=17 September 2012}}</ref>

Calder became a ubiquitous figure on the [[Scottish literature|Scottish literary]] scene writing essays and articles, books on [[Byron]] and [[T. S. Eliot]], and working as editor of collections of poetry and prose. He also wrote introductions to new publications of such diverse works as ''[[Great Expectations]]'', [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[Old Mortality]]'', [[T. E. Lawrence]]'s ''[[Seven Pillars of Wisdom]]'', [[Evelyn Waugh]]'s ''[[Sword of Honour]]'' trilogy and [[James Boswell]]'s ''[[The Life of Samuel Johnson]]''.
In 1981 he published ''Revolutionary Empire'' (1981), a study of three centuries of imperial development by English speakers to the end of the 18th century. ''Revolving Culture: Notes from the Scottish Republic'' is a collection of essays on [[Scottish topics]] which expressed itself through the writings of such figures as [[Robert Burns]] and Scott and in gestures of ''[[realpolitik]]'' such as the repression of "[[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]]" during the [[French Revolution]]. In 1984 Calder helped to set up the [[Scottish Poetry Library]] in Edinburgh and served as its first convener. He also worked as an editor of [[Hugh MacDiarmid]]'s prose.<ref name="obit">{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/angus-calder-historian-author-and-poet-1-1172007|title=Angus Calder: Historian, author and poet|newspaper=The Scotsman|date=9 June 2008|access-date=17 September 2012}}</ref> Calder won the [[Eric Gregory Award]] for his poetry.

==Politics==
A nationalist and socialist, he moved from the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) to the [[Scottish Socialist Party]], and though he cherished the [[Scottish republican]] spirit, he sought to challenge some of the popular myths surrounding the country's sense of national identity. In ''Revolving Culture: Notes from a Scottish republic'' (1992) he described the development, during the early stages of the Union with England, of an "intellectual republic" forged by a combination of insularity and lack of English interest in Scottish affairs.<ref name="obit"/> In 1997 he edited ''Time to Kill — the Soldier's Experience of War in the West 1939–1945'' with [[Paul Addison]]; ''Scotlands of the Mind'' (2002); ''Disasters and Heroes: On War, Memory and Representation'' (2004); and ''Gods, Mongrels and Demons: 101 Brief but Essential Lives'' (2004), a collection of potted biographies of "creatures who have extended my sense of the potentialities, both comic and tragic, of human nature". He had always published verse and won a Gregory Award for his poetry in 1967. Questions of [[Scottish national identity]] assumed growing importance in the 1980s, and Calder became active in the debate. A distinctive "Scottish social ethos" informed the activities of prominent Scots in the years of Empire, when they had invested heavily in the concept of [[Britishness]], although he reportedly felt that the Scots had meddled much more overweeningly with the English sense of identity than the English ever did with the Scots. He was delighted to discover that the game of [[cricket]] had [[Cricket in Sri Lanka|been introduced to Sri Lanka]] by a Scot.<ref name="Telegraph Obit">{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/2119621/Angus-Calder.html | title=Obituaries: Angus Calder | work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] | date=June 12, 2008 | access-date=April 15, 2016}}</ref>

==Personal life==
His first wife was [[Jenni Calder|Jennifer Daiches]], daughter of Scottish literary critic [[David Daiches]], with whom Calder collaborated on a book about [[Sir Walter Scott]] in 1969.<ref name="unity"/> The Calders had two daughters, Rachel and Gowan, and a son, Gideon. His first marriage ended in 1982; he married Kate Kyle in 1986, with whom he had a son, Douglas, born in 1989. He took early retirement from the Open University in 1995.

==Death==
Calder died from [[lung cancer]] on 5 June 2008, aged 66.<ref name="unity">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/2119621/Angus-Calder.html|title=Angus Calder: Historian who challenged the popular conception of British national unity during the Second World War|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=12 June 2008|access-date=17 September 2012}}</ref>  In the closing weeks of his life, the poet [[Richard Berengarten]], together with his son Gideon Calder edited a [https://www.euppublishing.com/doi/pdfplus/10.3366/scot.2009.0058 collection of writing and sketches] for and about him, which appeared just after his death.
