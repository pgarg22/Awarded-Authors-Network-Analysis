==Trivia==

Tidhar is referenced in several works of fiction:

* In [[Adam Roberts (British writer)|Adam Roberts]]'s ''Jack Glass'' (2012), "Tidharian" is referred to as a futuristic spoken language. "It was English Dia was speaking, after all: not Potpourri or Tidharian or Pidgin-Martian."<ref>Roberts, Adam. Jack Glass. London: Gollancz 2012</ref>
* In [[Christopher Farnsworth]]'s ''Killfile'', the Mossad agent friend of the protagonist is named Tidhar after the author (though it is briefly mentioned he has a different first name). "I am on guard, because Tidhar is no one you want to mess with, even by accident." ... "Thanks to Tidhar, I'm piggybacking on Mossad tech." .... "I should tell Tidhar, if I ever see him again..."<ref>Farnsworth, Christopher. Killfile. NY: William Morrow, 2016</ref>
* In the [[Shimon Adaf]] short story "third_attribute", the protagonist visits Tidhar's childhood home as he contemplates writing a thesis on Tidhar's Hebrew poetry. "He wanders along the Kibbutz pathways, but doesn’t become any wiser. A battered copy of ''Remnants of God'', Tidhar’s only poetry book in Jewish [Jewish? He knew Jewish once!] held under his arm."<ref>Adaf, Shimon. "third_attribute", translated by Yaron Regev. In Tidhar and Adaf. Art and War. London: Repeater Books 2016</ref>
* In Nick Wood's ''Azanian Bridges'' (2016), Tidhar's ''Osama'' is mentioned as a banned book in the alternate history [[South Africa]] of the novel.<ref>Wood, Nick. Azanian Bridges. Alconbury Weston: Newcon Press 2016</ref>
* In [[Charlie Kaufman]]'s ''Antkind'' (2020), protagonist B. Rosenberger Rosenberg is portrayed as a former fan of Tidhar (along with [[Isaac Asimov]] and [[Harlan Ellison]]) turned against him. ""Yes," she screams, "Tidhar! You loved Tidhar!"" ... "I try to call after her, but I cannot. I cannot be a man who countenances Tidhar."<ref>Kaufman, Charlie. Antkind. NY: Random House, 2020</ref>
