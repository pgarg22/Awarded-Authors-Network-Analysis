Levin said in 2002, 
<blockquote>"I feel guilty that 'Rosemary's Baby' led to ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]],'' ''[[The Omen]].'' A whole generation has been exposed, has more belief in Satan. I don't believe in Satan. And I feel that the strong fundamentalism we have would not be as strong if there hadn't been so many of these books [...] Of course, I didn't send back any of the royalty checks."<ref name=NYT /></blockquote>

Other Levin novels that were adapted as films included ''[[The Stepford Wives]]'' in 1975,<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |title=The Stepford Wives (1975) Screen: 'Stepford Wives' Assays Suburbia's Detergent Set |author-link=Vincent Canby |first=Vincent |last=Canby|date=February 13, 1975 |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D01EFDC1E30E03ABC4B52DFB466838E669EDE}}</ref> again in 2004.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The New York Times |title=The Stepford Wives (2004) Film Review; Married To a Machine |first=A.

[[Stephen King]] has described Ira Levin as the "Swiss watchmaker" of suspense novels: "Every novel he has ever written has been a marvel of plotting.
