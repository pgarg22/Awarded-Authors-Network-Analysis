==Early life==

Aged 19, Morpurgo married [[Clare Morpurgo|Clare]], eldest daughter of Sir [[Allen Lane]], the founder of [[Penguin Books]], in 1963.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00tjrgz "Penguin, Puffin and the Paperback Revolution"].

==Farms for City Children==
{{Main|Farms for City Children}}
In 1976, Morpurgo and his wife Clare established the charity [[Farms for City Children]],<ref>{{EW charity|325120|Farms for City Children}}</ref> with the primary aim of providing children from inner city areas with experience of the countryside.<ref>{{YouTube|Ktl3_VFg6qo|AdventureBox Books Interview on Farms for Children}}</ref> The programme involves the children spending a week at a countryside farm, during which they take part in purposeful farmyard work.<ref>[http://www.farmsforcitychildren.co.uk Farms for City Children webpage], farms4citychildren.co.uk; accessed 14 October 2015.</ref><ref name=FT/> The charity's first president was the couple's close friend and neighbour, [[Ted Hughes]].<ref name=life>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jul/11/once-upon-life-michael-morpurgo-farms-city-children|title=Once upon a life: Michael Morpurgo|last=Morpurgo|first=Michael|date=2010-07-10|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-01-05|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

About 85,000 children have taken part in the scheme since it was set up, and the charity now has three farms in [[Wales]], [[Devon]], [[Gloucestershire]]. Morpurgo has referred to the charity as his greatest achievement in life.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/c6d4e7a6-133e-11e7-b0c1-37e417ee6c76|title=A Q&A with writer Michael Morpurgo|newspaper=Financial Times|date=2017-03-31|access-date=2020-01-05|last1=Lacey|first1=Hester}}</ref>

==Career==
===From teaching to writing novels===
It was not until he was teaching in Kent that Morpurgo discovered his vocation in life, of which he later said "I could see there was magic in it for them, and realized there was magic in it for me."<ref>{{Cite book|title=War Horse|last=Morpurgo|first=Michael|publisher=Scholastic Inc.|year=2010|isbn=9780545311854|chapter=An Interview with Michael Morpurgo|page=167}}</ref>

Morpurgo's writing career was inspired by [[Ted Hughes]]' ''Poetry in the Making'', [[Paul Gallico]]'s ''[[The Snow Goose: A Story of Dunkirk|The Snow Goose]]'' and [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]''.<ref name="guardian1">[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jun/12/michael.morpurgo "Michael Morpurgo,"] ''The Guardian'' (US). 22 July 2008, retrieved 17 April 2011.</ref> Hughes and another poet, [[Seán Rafferty]], were influential in his career, with Hughes becoming a friend, mentor and neighbour. Morpurgo credits Hughes and Rafferty with giving him the confidence to write ''War Horse'', his most successful work to date.<ref name=life/>
