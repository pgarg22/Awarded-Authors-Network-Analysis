Fussel first traversed into reading when she joined school, and was studious pupil, motivated by the fact that books were awarded as academic prizes. She began writing when one of her children had stopped reading, which initially took the form of a mother-son writing project, but eventually had to abandon it as she was told to ''"go write your own book"''.{{Clarify|reason=|date=March 2019}} 

Fussell works as a [[Programmer|computer programmer]] and is passionate about using technology to encourage reading and writing in children.
