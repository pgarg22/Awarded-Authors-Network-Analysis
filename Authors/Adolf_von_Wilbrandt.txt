'''Adolf von Wilbrandt''' (24 August 1837{{snd}}10 June 1911) was a German [[novelist]] and [[dramatist]].

==History==
Wilbrandt was born in [[Rostock]].  His father was a professor at the [[University of Rostock]]. He received early education in his native town, and then entered the university and engaged in the study of [[law]].<ref>See entry of [http://purl.uni-rostock.de/matrikel/200007158 Adolf Wilbrandt] in [[Rostock Matrikelportal]]</ref> He soon abandoned law in favour of [[philology]] and [[history]], and continued these studies in [[Berlin]] and [[Munich]]. After taking the degree of [[Doctor of Philosophy]], he joined the staff of the ''Süddeutsche Zeitung'' in Munich.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

He travelled abroad for a time and in 1871 he settled in [[Vienna]], where, two years later, he married the actress, [[Auguste Wilbrandt-Baudius|Auguste Baudius]]. In 1881, Wilbrandt was appointed director of the Hofburg theatre in succession to [[Franz von Dingelstedt]], an office he held until 1887. In this year he returned to his native town, and remained actively engaged in literary production.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Wilbrandt is distinguished both as a dramatist and novelist. His merits were acknowledged by the award of the [[Franz Grillparzer Prize]] on two occasions—in 1895 for the tragedy ''[[Gracchi|Gracchus]] der Volkstribun'', and in 1890 for his dramatic poem ''Der Meister von [[Palmyra]]'', while in 1878 he received the [[Schiller Prize]] for his dramatic productions.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
