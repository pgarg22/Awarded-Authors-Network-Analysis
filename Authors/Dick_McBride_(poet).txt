'''Richard William McBride''' (May 8, 1928 – August 28, 2012) was an American [[beat poet]], playwright and novelist. He worked at [[City Lights Bookstore|City Lights Booksellers & Publishers]] from 1954 to 1969.

==Life==

Born in [[Washington, Indiana]], McBride spent years traveling around [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Kentucky]] and [[Nebraska]] working in radio, before moving to [[San Francisco]], in the early 1950s.<ref name="Ref-1">McBride, D: ''Remembered America: poems by Dick McBride'' Rue Bella, 2004 {{ISBN|0-9536710-9-7}}</ref>

[[Kenneth Patchen]] introduced him to [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]], who offered him a job as store manager at the [[City Lights Bookstore]]. He worked at City Lights for 16 years<ref name="Ref-1"/> and became friends with [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]] and several other [[Beat Generation]] writers.<ref>McBride, D: ''Garden'' Annihilator Press, 1999.</ref>

In 1964, McBride moved to the United Kingdom for six months to help "bohemianize" [[Better Books]] in London for [[Tony Godwin]].<ref>McBride, D: ''Live at The Big Chill Festival'' Audio CD-R, 2006.</ref>

In 1967, City Lights moved their publishing operation to 1562 Grant Avenue, McBride ran this part of the business with his brother Bob McBride and Martin Broadley for several years.<ref name="Ref-2">Ferlinghetti, L. & Morgan, B., ''The Beat Generation in San Francisco: A Literary Tour'', City Lights Books, 2003, {{ISBN|0-87286-417-0}}</ref>

He returned to England in 1969, where he worked as the director of independent book distributors McBride Bros. and Broadley, selling books in England and to the Continent.<ref name="Ref-1"/>

In the summer of 1973, McBride and Bernard Stone hosted a "[[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July Party]]" for Allen Ginsberg at the [[Turret Bookshop]], London. Ginsberg’s ''[[The Fall of America: Poems of These States|Fall of America]]'' had been published earlier that year, and it seemed appropriate to hold a reading on the birthday of American Independence. The party is commemorated in his biography of Ginsberg, ''Cometh With Clouds'' (Cherry Valley Editions 1982).<ref name="Ref-3">McBride, D., ''Cometh With Clouds (Memory: Allen Ginsberg)'' Cherry Valley Editions, 1982, {{ISBN|0-916156-51-6}}</ref>

Then during the 1980s, McBride moved on to Australia. In 1988, he returned to the UK and settled in [[West Malvern]], Worcestershire.

In November 1996, he was a guest at the [[Conegliano]] Poetry Festival, where he read his poetry alongside [[Yevgeny Yevtushenko]], [[Andrey Voznesensky]] and [[Roger McGough]]. The festival was organised to honour City Lights and the Beats and to celebrate Allen Ginsberg's 70th birthday<ref>McBride D., "Allen Ginsberg and the blue rinse brigade" [http://urthona.com ''Urthona Art & Buddhism''] Issue 15, 2001.</ref>

In 2001 he collaborated with [http://celluloidband.com Celluloid] on the "Last Beat" project, a live and recorded performance project that received airplay on [[BBC Radio 3]]'s ''[[Late Junction]]''. A UK tour followed, including a performance at the Birmingham ArtsFest.<ref>[http://archive.redditchadvertiser.co.uk/2001/8/24/310489.html "Beat Goes On For Poet Dick"]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} [http://www.redditchadvertiser.co.uk/ ''Redditch Advertiser''], 24 August 2001.</ref>

In 2006 he headlined the "Words In Motion" stage at the [[The Big Chill (music festival)|Big Chill Festival]] at [[Eastnor Castle]].

In January, 2009 McBride appeared at "The British Beat" event as part of the "Back On the Road" exhibition at the [[Barber Institute of Fine Arts]], [[Birmingham]]. The exhibition featured the original manuscript scroll of [[Jack Kerouac]]'s ''[[On the Road]]''. The event was curated by Professor [http://www.uscanada.bham.ac.uk/staff/ellis.htm Dick Ellis], Head of American and Canadian Studies at [[University of Birmingham|Birmingham University]], and also featured readings by Jim Burns, [[Ian McMillan (poet)|Ian McMillan]], David Tipton and Camelia Ellias.

==Literary career==
McBride's first collection of poetry, ''Oranges'', was published in 1960 by Wilder Bentley at the Bread and Wine Press in San Francisco, California. It was illustrated with [[woodcut]]s by the artist and actor, [[Victor Wong (actor born 1927)|Victor Wong]]. The Bread and Wine Mission was started by Pierre Delattre and was home to [[Bob Kaufman]]'s magazine ''Beatitude''.<ref name="Ref-2"/>

''Ballads of Blood'' was published in 1961 by the Golden Mountain Press, San Francisco.

McBride's first book, ''Lonely the Autumn Bird: Two Novels'', was published by Alan Swallow in 1963. It consists of two short novels: the title novel ''Lonely the Autumn Bird'' and ''Tilt''.

In 1966, his second novel, ''Memoirs of a Natural-Born Expatriate'', was published by Alan Swallow. It tells the story of a man who (like the author) works at City Lights Bookstore.

In 1982, [[Charles Plymell]]'s [http://www.cherryvalleyeditions.com Cherry Valley Editions] published ''Cometh With Clouds'' a short biography of Allen Ginsberg. It contains a foreword by Lawrence Ferlinghetti.

''Jacqui – Love Poems'' was privately produced in 1994. The second edition was published by McBride's Books in 1997 and is dedicated to his second wife, Jacqui.

McBride's third novel, ''The Astonished I (Memories & Wet Dreams)'' was published by McBride's Books in 1995. It is a recollection of the authors time in San Francisco. It is dedicated to his friend Tim Prael and contains an introduction by Charles Plymell.

The first chapter of the book recalls a conversation with Jack Kerouac, who had phoned City Lights to talk to Ferlinghetti about publishing ''[[Visions of Cody]]''. A slightly different version of the first chapter was originally published in ''Transit'' and then ''The Beat Journals'', both published by Kevin Ring's ''[http://www.beatscene.net/ Beat Scene Press]''.

The second chapter of ''The Astonished I'' describes the first reading of "Thou Shalt Not Kill" (a lament for the death of [[Dylan Thomas]]) by [[Kenneth Rexroth]] at the Cellar in Green Street, San Francisco.<ref>McBride, D., ''The Astonished I: Memories and Wet Dreams'', McBride's Books, 1995, {{ISBN|0-9527136-0-8}}</ref>

His most recent collection of poetry, ''Remembered America: Poems by Dick McBride'', was published by Rue Bella in 2004.
