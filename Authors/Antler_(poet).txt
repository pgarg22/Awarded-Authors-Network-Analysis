== Writing style ==
Antler's work exhibits a punk sensibility, an unabashed sense of humor and a cutting satirical edge.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} His work reflects the influences of [[Walt Whitman]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], and the American traditions of [[transcendentalism]] and [[environmentalism]].<ref>"Re-arm America Vs. Re-Fellatio America", poem - published in "Van Gogh's Ear", French Connection Press, 2004.</ref> He celebrates the [[wilderness]], often comparing urban, industrial life unfavorably with natural phenomena. His frank, sometimes earthy poems frequently exhibit sexual and spiritual energy entwined with the wonder of the natural world.<ref>"Stands To Reason", poem - published in "Van Gogh's Ear", French Connection Press, 2004.</ref>
