==Early life==

He was born in [[Colchester]], [[Essex]], where he attended the [[Colchester Royal Grammar School|local grammar school]]. He served as an officer in the [[British Army]] in [[World War I]], having joined the [[Artists' Rifles]] in 1916, being awarded a [[Military Cross]].<ref name = PN>[http://www.poetrymagazines.org.uk/magazine/record.asp?id=1920 ''A Conversation with Edgell Rickword'']</ref> He was a published [[war poet]], and collected his early verse in ''Behind the Eyes'' (1921).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.english.emory.edu/LostPoets/Rickword.html|title = Trench Poets}}</ref>

On 4 January 1919, Rickword developed an illness that was diagnosed as a "general vascular invasion which had resulted in general septicaemia". His left eye was so badly infected that they thought it necessary to remove it to prevent the infection from spreading to the other eye.

He went up to the [[University of Oxford]] in 1919, staying only four terms reading French literature, and leaving when he married. Literary friends from this period included mainly other ex-soldiers: [[Anthony Bertram]], [[Edmund Blunden]], [[Vivian de Sola Pinto]], [[A. E. Coppard]], [[Louis Golding]], [[Robert Graves]], [[L. P. Hartley]], and [[Alan Porter]].<ref>Hobday, p. 44.</ref> His work appeared in the ''Oxford Poetry'' 1921 [[anthology]], with Blunden, Golding, Porter, Graves, [[Richard Hughes (writer)|Richard Hughes]], and [[Frank Prewett]].<ref>http://www.gnelson.demon.co.uk/oxpoetry/index/ir.html {{Bare URL inline|date=May 2021}}</ref>

==Critic==

He then took up literary work in London. He reviewed for [[The Times Literary Supplement|the ''Times Literary Supplement'']], which led to his celebrated review of [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Waste Land]]''. [[J. C. Squire]] published him in the ''London Mercury'', and [[Desmond MacCarthy]] as literary editor of the ''[[New Statesman]]'' gave him work.

He started the  ''[[Calendar of Modern Letters]]'' literary review, now highly regarded, in March 1925. It lasted until July 1927, assisted by [[Douglas Garman]] and then [[Bertram Higgins]], and contributions from his cousin [[C. H. Rickword]]. The ''Scrutinies'' books of collected pieces from it were a ''succes d'estime''; the purpose of the publication was a mass killing of the sacred cows of Edwardian literature ([[G. K. Chesterton]], [[John Galsworthy]], [[John Masefield]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[H. G. Wells]]).<ref>David Perkins, ''A History of Modern Poetry: From the 1890s to the High Modernist Mode'' (1976), p. 419.</ref> Its undoubted influence as a precursor of later criticism was very marked in the early days of ''[[Scrutiny (journal)|Scrutiny]]'', the magazine founded a few years later by [[F. R. Leavis]] and [[Q. D. Leavis]].<ref>[[Bernard Bergonzi]], ''The Calendar of Modern Letters'', The Yearbook of English Studies, Vol. 16, Literary Periodicals Special Number (1986), pp. 150–163.</ref> Rickword also wrote for that publication.

==Communist==

He joined the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] in 1934,<ref>Hobday, p. 153.</ref> and became increasingly active in political work during the period of the [[Spanish Civil War]]; while still writing poetry. He was friendly with [[Randall Swingler]], the 'official' poetry voice of the CPGB, and with [[Jack Lindsay (writer)|Jack Lindsay]], his only real rival as a theoretician. He was closely connected with the leading cultural figures on the hard Left, such as [[Mulk Raj Anand]], [[Ralph Fox]], [[Julius Lipton]], [[A. L. Morton]], [[Sylvia Townsend Warner]] and [[Alick West]]. When [[Lawrence & Wishart]] was created as the official CPGB publishing house, in 1936, Rickword became a director.<ref>Hobday, p. 168.</ref> It was through Rickword that Lawrence & Wishart published [[Nancy Cunard]]'s ''Negro: An Anthology'', though at her own expense.<ref>Anne Chisholm, ''Nancy Cunard: A Biography (1979), p. 277.</ref>

At that same period he was a co-founder of the ''[[Left Review]]'', which he edited. His associates included [[James Boswell (artist)|James Boswell]], who was the art editor; they had met around 1929.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jboswell.info/hogarth.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120908234303/http://www.jboswell.info/hogarth.html |archivedate=8 September 2012 }}</ref><ref>Andy Croft (editor). ''A Weapon in the Struggle'' (1998), p. 29.</ref> ''Left Review'' existed from 1934 to 1938, was set up by Rickword and Douglas Garman, had as writers both CPGB members and notable figures outside the party, and founded Marxist criticism in the UK.<ref>Laura Marcus, Peter Nicholls, ''The Cambridge History of Twentieth-century English Literature'' (2004), p. 387.</ref><ref>M. Keith Booker, ''Encyclopedia of Literature and Politics: Censorship, Revolution, and Writing'' (2005), p. 419.</ref>

Later he became Editor of ''Our Time'', the Communist review, from 1944 to 1947, working with [[Arnold Rattenbury]]<ref>http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article1906567.ece {{Bare URL inline|date=May 2021}}</ref> and [[David Holbrook]]. Rickword had an upbeat view at the time on the possibilities of popular culture and radical politics, and the circulation rose as he broadened the publication's scope from popular political poetry.<ref>Simon Featherstone, ''War Poetry: An Introductory Reader'' (1995), p. 46.</ref> The post-war clique around ''Our Time'', the Salisbury Group (named for a pub), included [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]], [[Charles Hobday]], Holbrook, Mervyn Jones, Lindsay, Rattenbury, [[Montagu Slater]], Swingler, [[E.

Thompson]]; and [[Doris Lessing]] joined it.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/charles-hobday-528464.html The Independent]{{dead link|date=August 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} {{Bare URL inline|date=May 2021}}</ref>
