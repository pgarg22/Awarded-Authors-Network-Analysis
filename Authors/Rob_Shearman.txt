'''Robert Charles Shearman''' (sometimes credited as '''Rob Shearman'''; 10 February 1970, Horsham, Sussex<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.findmypast.co.uk/search/results?collection=civil+births&sourcecategory=life+events+%28bmds%29&firstname=robert&lastname=shearman&yearofbirth=1970&yearofbirth_offset=0&sourcecountry=great+britain|title=Search Results for Civil Births in Birth, Marriage, Death & Parish Records &#124; findmypast.co.uk|website=findmypast.co.uk}}</ref>) is an English television, radio, stage play and short story writer. He is known for his [[World Fantasy Award]]-winning short stories, as well as his work for ''[[Doctor Who]]'', and his association with Jarvis & Ayres Productions ([[Martin Jarvis (actor)|Martin Jarvis]] and [[Rosalind Ayres]]) which has resulted in six plays for [[BBC Radio 4]], broadcast in the station's regular weekday ''[[Afternoon Play]]'' slot, and one classic serial.

==Education==
Shearman was educated at [[Reigate Grammar School]] (where he was a contemporary of [[David Walliams]]) and [[University of Exeter]]. During this time, he was regularly seen on stage at the University in various productions.

==Career==
An established theatrical playwright, Shearman has worked with [[Alan Ayckbourn]], had a play produced by [[Francis Ford Coppola]], and has received several international awards for his work in [[theatre]]. Award-winning plays include ''Fool to Yourself'', which premiered at the [[Stephen Joseph Theatre]] in 1997, and which won the inaugural Sophie Winter Memorial Trust Award, ''Easy Laughter'', (Sunday Times Playwriting Award), ''Coupling'', (World Drama Trust Award), ''Binary Dreamers'', (Guinness Award for Theatre Ingenuity, in association with the [[Royal National Theatre]]). In 1993 he was made resident dramatist at the [[Northcott Theatre]] in Exeter, the youngest playwright to be honoured by the Arts Council in this way, and for them he wrote a series of plays, including his controversial comic fable about God living in suburbia, ''Breaking Bread Together'', which later was revived in London. His association with his mentor, Alan Ayckbourn, has been particularly fruitful, with ''White Lies'', ''About Colin'', and ''Knights in Plastic Armour'' proving especially popular.

At this time Shearman was also encouraged to become a director for the theatre, largely reviving productions of his work abroad; in the 1990s he had a recurring engagement with the Teatro Agora in Rome, and, in 2007, the revival he directed of his comedy ''Shaw Cornered'', was the stand-out hit as international guest at the Old World Theatre Festival in Delhi. In 2010, Big Finish published seven of his better known stage plays as ''Caustic Comedies''.

His first television work was episodes of the 1950s-set rural drama ''[[Born and Bred]]'', broadcast on [[BBC One]].

Shearman also provided the initial script for the second series of the [[BBC 7]] programme ''[[The Chain Gang (radio series)|The Chain Gang]]'': ''Picture This''. The series was awarded a Bronze in the Sony Radio Academy Awards' "The Competition Award" category.<ref name="Sony">{{cite web|url=http://www.radioawards.org/winners/?category=The_Competition_Award&year=2008|title=Winners 2008: The Competition Award|work=Sony Radio Academy Awards|publisher=Zafer Associates|access-date=2008-06-01}}</ref> A further series of ''The Chain Gang'', this time called ''Paper, Scissors, Stone'', was a thirteen-part drama series, in which Shearman worked weekly from listeners' suggestions in shaping the story; this won a Silver at the Sony Radio Awards.
===Doctor Who===
His association with ''[[Doctor Who]]'' began with a play written for [[Bill & Ben Video|BBV]] Audios, ''Punchline'', in which [[Sylvester McCoy]] played the Dominie, a disguised version of the [[Seventh Doctor]]. This was penned under the pseudonym "Jeremy Leadbetter" (the name of a character from the popular BBC sitcom ''[[The Good Life (1975 TV series)|The Good Life]]'').  Several [[audio drama|audio plays]] for [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]] followed, ''The Holy Terror'', ''The Chimes of Midnight'' and ''Jubilee'' all winning best audio drama in the ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' polls of their respective years. He has also had ''Doctor Who'' short stories published - his most recent being a chapter in the BBC Books novel ''The Story of Martha'', which was released in December 2008.

Shearman wrote the television episode "[[Dalek (Doctor Who episode)|Dalek]]" for the 2005 series of ''[[Doctor Who]]'' produced by [[Russell T Davies]] for the [[BBC]]. This was, at Davies' request, a re-working of the themes introduced in Shearman's earlier Big Finish audio play ''[[Jubilee (Doctor Who audio)|Jubilee]]''. "Dalek" was nominated for the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form]] in 2006, and came in second in terms of votes for its category. Shearman provided an [[audio commentary (DVD)|audio commentary]] for the episode on the ''Doctor Who â€“ Complete First Series'' [[DVD]] box set.

In a 2021 interview, Shearman revealed he had been involved in development for [[Doctor Who (series 5)|Series 5]], but later departed. Head writer [[Steven Moffat]] kept up an open invitation to return, but Shearman declined, citing changes in his career and the higher profile of writers on the series.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qci0EnMonuI&t=3709s</ref>

===Prose writing===
His first book, a collection of short stories called ''Tiny Deaths'', was published by [[Comma Press]] in November 2007. It was shortlisted for the Edge Hill Short Story Prize<ref name="Edgehill">{{cite web|url=http://www.edgehill.ac.uk/english/CreativeWriting/NWShortStory.htm|title=Literature Prize Shortlist Announced|date=2008-05-22|publisher=Edge Hill University|access-date=2008-06-01 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080604065751/http://www.edgehill.ac.uk/english/CreativeWriting/NWShortStory.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2008-06-04}}</ref> and made the longlist for the Frank O'Connor International Short Story Award.<ref name="Guard1">{{cite news|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,,2278198,00.html|title= Self-published author takes competition to bestseller rivals|last=Irvine|first=Lindesay|date=6 May 2008|work=The Guardian|access-date=2008-06-01}}</ref> In November 2008, it was named Best Collection at the annual World Fantasy Awards.<ref name="CityLife1">{{cite news|url=http://www.citylife.co.uk/arts/news/11411_comma_press_scoops_fantasy_award|title=Comma Press scoops fantasy award|last=Popperwell|first=Katie|date=4 November 2008|work=CityLife|publisher=M.E.N. media|access-date=2008-11-17}}</ref> In 2009, one of the stories from the book, "No Looking Back", was selected by the National Library of Singapore for the Read! Singapore campaign, ensuring the story was published separately as a mini-book and distributed all over the country in English, Chinese, Malay and Tamil; the author was flown over to Singapore to give talks and interviews.

His second collection, ''Love Songs for the Shy and Cynical'', was published in late 2009. An odder, darker book than the first, it won the [[British Fantasy Award]], the Edge Hill Short Story Reader's Prize - making Shearman the first writer ever to be nominated twice for this award - and the [[Shirley Jackson Award]]. A special collector's edition contained "The Hidden Story"; a tale about letters found within books, each copy was handwritten by the author, and contained in envelopes within envelopes in a Russian doll effect.

In the same year, [[Mad Norwegian Press]] published ''Wanting to Believe,'' a book by Shearman that examines ''[[The X-Files]]'' and its spin-off series (''[[Millennium (TV series)|Millennium]]'' and ''[[The Lone Gunmen (TV series)|The Lone Gunmen]]'') in a critical fashion. Also in 2009, Shearman collaborated with comedian [[Toby Hadoke]] to watch and comment on every episode of ''Doctor Who'' from the programme's debut in 1963 to [[David Tennant]]'s final story.  The resulting discussions are being published by Mad Norwegian Press in three volumes as ''Running Through Corridors: Rob and Toby's Marathon Watch of Doctor Who''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://madnorwegian.com/262/books/running-through-corridors-rob-and-tobys-marathon-watch-of-doctor-who-vol-1-the-60s/ |title=Running Through Corridors: Rob and Toby's Marathon Watch of Doctor Who (Vol. 1: The 60s) |publisher=[[Mad Norwegian Press]]  |access-date=10 March 2011}}</ref> The first volume, covering the 1960s, was published in 2010; the second volume, covering the 1970s, was published in 2016.

His third collection, "half short stories, half novel", was published in June 2011, called ''Everyone's Just So So Special''.
==Analysis==
Shearman describes himself as a comedy writer, but it might be truer to call him an absurdist; most of his work, whatever the medium it is written for, is concerned with the effect on ordinary people when they're propelled into extraordinary or fantastical situations. His controversial early play, ''Easy Laughter'', purports to be a Christmas domestic comedy, but eventually reveals itself to be set in an [[alternate history]] where the season celebrates not only the birth of Jesus but the [[The Holocaust|successful extermination of the Jewish race]]. His WFA nominated short story, "Damned if You Don't", is at once a story about disillusioned marriage touching upon themes of what it means to be [[evil]], but also about a man who goes to [[Hell]] and falls in love with the talking ghost of Hitler's childhood pet dog, who he had unwillingly been made roommates with.
