Smith began making books out of taped paper towels when she was five years old.<ref name="Fantasticfiction site"/>  When she was 8, she started writing about another world, [[Sartorias-deles]], though she soon switched to making comic books of her stories, which she found to be easier.

However, some of the novels Smith first wrote as a teen, including ''[[Wren to the Rescue]]'', were sold after she learned to rewrite.<ref name="Smith FAQ"/>

In the years it took her to learn to rewrite, Smith "went to college, lived in Europe, came back to get [her] masters in History, worked in Hollywood, got married, started a family and became a teacher."<ref name="Smith FAQ"/> She received her degrees from the University of Southern California (B.A.) in 1973 and the University of California, Santa Barbara (M.A.) in 1977.<ref name="Contemporary Authors Online"/> In 2010 she became a member of [https://www.sherwoodsmith.net/2014/12/book-view-cafe/ Book View Cafe.]

====Sartorias-deles====
'''Sartorias-deles''' is the name of the fictitious world that is the setting for many of the books by Sherwood Smith. It is one of four inhabited planets in the [[Erhal]] [[planetary system|system]].<ref name="General Background">{{cite web |url=http://www.sherwoodsmith.net/SD/Concept.html |publisher=Official Sherwood Smith Site |title=Sartorias-deles: The Underlying Concept |access-date=2016-06-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140103030420/http://www.sherwoodsmith.net/SD/Concept.html |archive-date=January 3, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> According to Smith, humans first arrived on Sartorias-deles through world gates untold millennia ago. Occasionally, still more humans arrive.  However, in non-[[canon (fiction)|canon]] commentaries the author informs readers that most of the early human history on Sartorias-deles has been lost since the so-called Fall of Sartor approximately 4,000 years before the events of the books such as ''[[Senrid]]''.<ref name="General Background"/> Smith does indeed appear to intend these humans be portrayed as having been Terrans prior to their immigration to the Erhal system. For example, in numerous references throughout the stories, they appear to have brought with them several domesticated animal species, including cattle, horses, and dogs, as well as many foods such as [[coffee]], [[rice]], the [[tomato]],<ref name="Tomato">''Wren to the Rescue'', page 38, paragraph 7 (2004 Firebird edition)</ref> and concepts such as the [[week|seven-day week]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sherwoodsmith.net/SD/Inda.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-09-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140911112005/http://www.sherwoodsmith.net/SD/Inda.html |archive-date=September 11, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>
