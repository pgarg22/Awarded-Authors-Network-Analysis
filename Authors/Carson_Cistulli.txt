===Panic attacks===
In an essay about sports and aesthetics, "A Lengthy Meditation on Baseball and the Science of Happiness," Cistulli explained that part of his turn towards writing was a therapeutic response to [[anxiety attacks]]. Cistulli wrote that these attacks became so intense that he at times struggled to breathe: "During the fall of 2001, while living in Missoula, MT, I began experiencing some symptoms of generalized anxiety: occasional tightness or pain in the chest and limbs, invasive thoughts about death and illness [...] those symptoms persisted off and on into the next spring, at which time I developed a considerably less pleasant one (i.e., symptom): for long periods of time, and with no warning, I was unable to breathe involuntarily."<ref name="iamtryingtobreakyoureyes">[http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/index.php/i-am-trying-to-break-your-eyes-a-lengthy-meditation-on-baseball-and-the-science-of-happiness/ I am Trying to Break Your Eyes: A Lengthy Meditation on Baseball and the Science of Happiness] Retrieved November 25, 2010</ref>

Lisa Baker writes that "In a day and age when we are quick to consume the rigid definitions of relationships fed to us by those who wield power, Cistulli tutors us in language's malleability; a new comparison, an unexpected verb in a familiar phrase can force an entirely new perspectiveâ€”and perhaps one more
curious and more [[Generosity|generous]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.milton.edu/news/upload/magazine_fall07.pdf |title=Some Common Weaknesses Illustrated |accessdate=2010-12-01 |publisher=Milton Magazine |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218133542/http://milton.edu/news/upload/magazine_fall07.pdf |archivedate=December 18, 2010 |df=mdy }}</ref>
