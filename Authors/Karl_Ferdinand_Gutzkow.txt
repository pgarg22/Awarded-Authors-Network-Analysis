'''Karl Ferdinand Gutzkow''' ({{birth date|df=yes|1811|3|17}} in Berlin &ndash; {{death date|df=yes|1878|12|16}} in [[Sachsenhausen (Frankfurt am Main)|Sachsenhausen]]) was a German writer notable in the [[Young Germany]] movement of the mid-19th century.

==Life==
Gutzkow was born of an extremely poor family, not proletarian, but of the lowest and most menial branch of state employees.<ref name="americana">{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Gutzkow, Karl|year=1920}}</ref> His father held a clerkship in the war office in Berlin,<ref name="eb"/> and was pietistic and puritanical in his outlook and demands. Jacob Wittmer Hartmann speculates that Gutzkow's later agnosticism was probably a reaction against the excessive religiosity of his early surroundings.<ref name="americana"/> After completing his basic studies, beginning in 1829 Gutzkow studied theology and philosophy at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]],<ref name="eb"/> where his teachers included [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] and [[Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher|Schleiermacher]].<ref name="Sagarra">Sagarra, Eda (2000).

While still a student, he began his literary career by the publication in 1831 of a periodical entitled ''Forum der Journalliteratur''. This brought him to the notice of [[Wolfgang Menzel]], who invited him to Stuttgart to assist in the editorship of the ''Literaturblatt''. At the same time he continued his university studies at [[University of Jena|Jena]], [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]] and [[University of Munich|Munich]]. In 1832 he published ''Briefe eines Narren an eine Närrin'' anonymously in Hamburg; and in 1833 his novel ''Maha-Guru, Geschichte eines Gottes'', a fantastic and satirical romance set in Tibet, was issued in Stuttgart by the well known {{Interlanguage link multi|Cotta’sche Verlagsbuchhandlung|de|3=Cotta’sche Verlagsbuchhandlung|lt=Cotta}} publishing house. In 1835 he went to [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]], where he founded the ''Deutsche Revue''.<ref name="eb">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Gutzkow, Karl Ferdinand}}</ref> While Gutzkow started out as a collaborator of Wolfgang Menzel, he ended up his adversary.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Also in 1835, his novel ''Wally die Zweiflerin'' appeared.  News of the 1830 [[July Revolution]] at Paris had moved him deeply, and the general atmosphere of radicalism pervading Europe at that time, and perhaps more specifically a reading of the ''Life of Jesus'' by [[David Friedrich Strauss]], influenced Gutzkow in the composition of this first novel, which exalts the agnosticism and emancipated views of the heroine, Wally.<ref name="americana"/> The work was directed specially against the institution of marriage and the belief in revelation.<ref name="eb"/> The book incorporates many ideas that Gutzkow had recently absorbed from French writers, notably [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Henri de Saint-Simon]], particularly the latter's theory of the emancipation of the flesh.<ref name="americana"/>

Immediately after its publication, the writings of Gutzkow, together with those of [[Heinrich Heine]], [[Heinrich Laube]], [[Ludolf Wienbarg]] and [[Theodor Mundt]], were banned by the [[Bundesversammlung (German Confederation)|German Federal Assembly]] in December 1835.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} This is usually taken as the starting point of the school known as [[Young Germany]], literary reformers heralding the [[Revolutions of 1848 in Germany|democratic upheaval of 1848]].<ref name="nie">{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Gutzkow, Karl|year=1905}}</ref> Whatever interest Gutzkow's novel might have attracted from its own merits was enhanced by the action of the German federal diet, which condemned Gutzkow to three months' imprisonment, decreed the suppression of all he had written or might yet write, and prohibited him from exercising the functions of editor within the [[German confederation]].<ref name="eb"/>

During his term of imprisonment at [[Mannheim]], Gutzkow wrote his treatise ''Zur Philosophie der Geschichte'' (1836). On obtaining his freedom he returned to Frankfurt, whence he went in 1837 to Hamburg. Here he inaugurated a new epoch of his literary activity by bringing out his tragedy ''Richard Savage'' (1839), which immediately made the round of all the German theatres. Of his numerous other plays, the majority by c. 1910 were neglected; but a few had obtained an established place in the repertory of the German theatre, especially the comedies ''Zopf und Schwert'' (1844), ''Das Urbild des Tartüffe'' (1847), ''Der Königsleutnant'' (1849) and the blank verse tragedy, ''[[Uriel Acosta]]'' (1847). In 1847, Gutzkow went to [[Dresden]], where he succeeded [[Tieck]] as literary adviser to the court theatre. Meanwhile, he had not neglected the novel. ''Seraphine'' (1838) was followed by ''Blasedow und seine Söhne'', a satire on the educational theories of the time. Between 1850 and 1852 appeared ''Die Ritter vom Geiste'', which may be regarded as the starting point for the modern German [[social novel]]. ''Der Zauberer von Rom'' is a powerful study of [[Roman Catholic]] life in southern Germany.<ref name="eb"/>

After the success of ''Die Ritter vom Geiste'', Gutzkow founded a journal on the model of Dickens' ''[[Household Words]]'', entitled ''Unterhaltungen am häuslichen Herd'', which first appeared in 1852 and continued till 1862. In 1864 he had an epileptic fit, and his theatrical powers began to diminish. To this period belong the historical novels ''Hohenschwangau'' (1868) and ''Fritz Ellrodt'' (1872), ''Lebensbilder'' (1870–1872), consisting of autobiographic sketches, and ''Die Söhne Pestalozzis'' (1870), with a plot founded on the story of [[Kaspar Hauser]]. After another epileptic episode Gutzkow journeyed to Italy in 1873, taking up residence in the country near Heidelberg on his return before moving again to Frankfurt, where he died on 16 December 1878.<ref name="eb"/>

With his play ''[[Uriel Acosta#Gutzkow.27s Uriel Acosta|Uriel Acosta]]'', and other works, Gutzkow stood up for the [[emancipation of the Jews]]; this play would later become the first classic play to be translated into [[Yiddish]], and become a longtime standard of [[Yiddish theater]]. Gutzkow was never a revolutionary, and he became more conservative with age. He was one of the first Germans who tried to make a living by writing.<ref name="Sagarra"/> His strong controversial purpose obscured his artistic genius, but his work profoundly influenced the popular thought of c. 1910 Germany, and gives one of the best pictures we have of the intellectual life and the social struggle of his generation and nation.<ref name="nie"/>

==Adaptations==
His comedy in 5 acts ''Zopf und Schwert'' (1844) received two adaptations; in 1926 [[Aafa-Film]] made the movie ''[[Sword and Shield (film)|Sword and Shield]]'', and [[Edmund Nick]] used it for his [[operetta]] ''Über alles siegt die Liebe'' (''Love Conquers Everything'', 1940), [[libretto]] by {{Interlanguage link multi|Bruno Hardt-Warden|de}}.
