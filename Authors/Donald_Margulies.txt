Margulies said of ''Sight Unseen'', "It's about loss, like most of my plays, and about identity."<ref name=rizzo/> [[Ben Brantley]] noted themes in his works: "The central motifs in ''Brooklyn Boy'' have always been visible in Mr. Margulies's work, from the willed amnesia of the self-invented artist (''Sight Unseen'') to the hazy lines between fiction and reality (''Collected Stories''). And Eric's fractious, divided family, summoned in recollection in ''Brooklyn Boy,'' has been anticipated in ''The Loman Family Picnic'' and ''What's Wrong With This Picture?''<ref>Brantley, Ben.
