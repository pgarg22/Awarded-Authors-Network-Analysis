Raised in a French-speaking home in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], Kerouac “learned English at age six and spoke with a marked accent into his late teens.”<ref>{{cite book |last=Herlihy-Mera |first=Jeffrey |date=2018 |title=After American Studies: Rethinking the Legacies of Transnational Exceptionalism |url= https://www.academia.edu/34217614 |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |page=64 |isbn= 978-1-138-05405-9}}</ref> During [[World War II]], he served in the [[United States Merchant Marine]]; he completed [[The Sea Is My Brother|his first novel]] at the time, which was published over 40 years after his death. His first published book was ''[[The Town and the City]]'', and he achieved widespread fame and notoriety with his second, ''[[On the Road]]'', in 1957. It made him a beat icon, who published 12 more novels during his life and numerous poetry volumes.

Kerouac is recognized for his style of spontaneous prose. Thematically, his work covers topics such as his Catholic spirituality, jazz, travel, promiscuity, life in [[New York City]], [[Buddhism]], drugs and poverty. He became an underground celebrity and, with other Beats, a [[progenitor]] of the [[History of the hippie movement|hippie movement]], although he remained antagonistic toward some of its politically radical elements.<ref>{{citation|last=Martinez|first=Manuel Luis|title=Countering the Counterculture: Rereading Postwar American Dissent from Jack Kerouac to Tomás Rivera|page=26|year=2003|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-19284-6|quote=Kerouac appeared to have done an about-face, becoming extraordinarily reactionary and staunchly anticommunist, vocalizing his intense hatred of the 1960s counterculture ...}}; ''id''. at p. 29 ("Kerouac realized where his basic allegiance lay and vehemently disassociated himself from hippies and revolutionaries and deemed them unpatriotic subversives."); ''id''. at p. 30 ("Kerouac['s] ... attempt to play down any perceived responsibility on his part for the hippie generation, whose dangerous activism he found repellent and "delinquent."); ''id''. at p. 111 ("Kerouac saw the hippies as mindless, communistic, rude, unpatriotic and soulless."); {{citation|last1=Maher|first1=Paul|title=Kerouac: His Life and Work|page=469|year=2007|publisher=Taylor Trade Publications|isbn=9781589793668|quote=In the current political climate, Kerouac wrote, he had nowhere to turn, as he liked neither the hippies ... nor the upper-echelon ...|last2=Amram|first2=David}}</ref> He has a lasting legacy, greatly influencing many of the cultural icons of the 1960s, including [[Bob Dylan]], [[the Beatles]], and [[the Doors]].

In 1969, at age 47, Kerouac died from an abdominal hemorrhage caused by a lifetime of heavy drinking. Since then, his literary prestige has grown, and several previously unseen works have been published. 

==Biography==
===Early life and adolescence===
[[File:Jack Kerouac's birthplace, 9 Lupine Road, Lowell MA.jpg|thumb|Jack Kerouac's birthplace, 9 Lupine Road, 2nd floor, West Centralville, Lowell, Massachusetts|alt=]]
Jack Kerouac was born on March 12, 1922, in Lowell, Massachusetts, to French Canadian parents, Léo-Alcide Kéroack (1889–1946) and Gabrielle-Ange Lévesque (1895–1973).<ref>Ann Charters, Samuel Charters, ''Brother-Souls: John Clellon Holmes, Jack Kerouac, and the Beat Generation'', University Press of Mississippi, 2010, p. 113</ref>

There is some confusion surrounding his name, partly because of variations on the spelling of ''Kerouac'', and because of Kerouac's own statement of his name as ''Jean-Louis Lebris de Kerouac''. His reason for that statement seems to be linked to an old family legend that the Kerouacs had descended from Baron François Louis Alexandre Lebris de Kerouac. Kerouac's baptism certificate lists his name simply as ''Jean Louis Kirouac'', the most common spelling of the name in Quebec.<ref name="autogenerated1983">{{harvnb|Nicosia|1994}}</ref> Research has shown that Kerouac's roots were indeed in [[Brittany]], and he was descended from a middle-class merchant colonist, Urbain-François Le Bihan, Sieur de [[Lanmeur|Kervoac]], whose sons married French Canadians.<ref name="dagier ; Quéméner"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.genealogie.org/famille/kirouac/PlaquesCOMM_AN.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222185908/http://www.genealogie.org/famille/kirouac/PlaquesCOMM_AN.htm|title=genealogie.org|archive-date=February 22, 2012}}</ref>

Kerouac's father Leo had been born into a family of potato farmers in the village of [[Saint-Hubert-de-Rivière-du-Loup, Quebec]]. Jack also had various stories on the etymology of his surname, usually tracing it to Irish, [[Breton language|Breton]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]], or other [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] roots.

In one interview he claimed it was from the name of the Cornish language (''Kernewek''), and that the Kerouacs had fled from Cornwall to Brittany.<ref>[[Alan M Kent]], ''Celtic Cornwall: Nation, Tradition, Invention.'' Halsgrove, 2012</ref> Another version was that the Kerouacs had come to Cornwall from Ireland before the time of Christ and the name meant "language of the house".<ref>Michael J. Dittman, Jack Kerouac: A Biography, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004</ref> In still another interview he said it was an Irish word for "language of the water" and related to ''Kerwick''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Berrigan, Ted |author-link=Ted Berrigan |url=http://www.parisreview.com/media/4260_KEROUAC.pdf |title=The Art of Fiction No. 43: Jack Kerouac, pg. 49 |work=[[The Paris Review]] |year=1968 |access-date=May 14, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528025958/http://www.parisreview.com/media/4260_KEROUAC.pdf |archive-date=May 28, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Kerouac, derived from ''Kervoach'', is the name of a town in Brittany in [[Lanmeur]], near [[Morlaix]].<ref name="dagier ; Quéméner">{{harvnb|Dagier|2009}}</ref>
[[Image:Jack Kerouac's 3rd home, 34 Beaulieu.jpg|thumb|left|His third of several homes growing up in the West Centralville section of Lowell]]
Jack Kerouac later referred to 34 Beaulieu Street as "sad Beaulieu". The Kerouac family was living there in 1926 when Jack's older brother Gerard died of [[rheumatic fever]], aged nine. This deeply affected four-year-old Jack, who later said Gerard followed him in life as a guardian angel. This is the Gerard of Kerouac's novel ''[[Visions of Gerard]]''. He had one other sibling, an older sister named Caroline. Kerouac was referred to as Ti Jean or little John around the house during his childhood.<ref name="autogenerated1983"/>

Kerouac spoke French with his family and began learning English at school, around age six; he began speaking it confidently in his late teens.<ref>{{cite book |last=Herlihy-Mera |first=Jeffrey |title=After American Studies: Rethinking the Legacies of Transnational Exceptionalism |year=2018 |url= https://www.academia.edu/34217614 |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |page=64 |isbn= 978-1-138-05405-9}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Sandison|1999}}</ref> He was a serious child who was devoted to his mother, who played an important role in his life.

Some of Kerouac's poetry was written in French, and in letters written to friend [[Allen Ginsberg]] towards the end of his life, he expressed a desire to speak his parents' native tongue again. In 2016, a whole volume of previously unpublished works originally written in French by Kerouac was published as ''La vie est d'hommage''.<ref>{{cite news|work = Le Devoir | language = fr| url = https://www.ledevoir.com/lire/467010/l-autre-kerouac | access-date = April 13, 2019 | date= April 2, 2016 | title = L'autre Kerouac| first = Christian |last= Desmeules}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.editionsboreal.qc.ca/catalogue/livres/vie-est-hommage-2490.html|title=La vie est d'hommage|website=Éditions Boréal |access-date=April 26, 2016|language=fr}}</ref>

On May 17, 1928, while six years old, Kerouac had his first [[Confession (religion)|Confession]].<ref name="books.google.com">{{cite book |last=Amburn |first=Ellis |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bN0PJn6VCNIC |title=Subterranean Kerouac: The Hidden Life of Jack Kerouac |pages=13–14 |publisher=MacMillan |year=1999 |isbn=9780312206772 }}</ref> For [[penance]], he was told to say a [[rosary]], during which he heard God tell him that he had a good soul, that he would suffer in life and [[#Death|die in pain and horror]], but would in the end receive salvation.<ref name="books.google.com"/> This experience, along with his dying brother's vision of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] (as the nuns fawned over him, convinced he was a saint), combined with a later study of Buddhism and an ongoing commitment to Christ, solidified the worldview which informed his work.<ref name="books.google.com"/>

Kerouac once told [[Ted Berrigan]], in an interview for ''[[The Paris Review]]'', of an incident in the 1940s in which his mother and father were walking together in a Jewish neighborhood on the [[Lower East Side]] of New York. He recalled "a whole bunch of rabbis walking arm in arm&nbsp;... teedah- teedah – teedah&nbsp;... and they wouldn't part for this Christian man and his wife, so my father went POOM! and knocked a rabbi right in the gutter."<ref>{{harvnb|Miles|1998|p=8}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Berrigan|1968|p=14}}</ref> Leo, after the death of his child, also treated a priest with similar contempt, angrily throwing him out of the house despite his invitation from Gabrielle.<ref name="culturewars.com"/>

Kerouac was a capable athlete in football and wrestling. Kerouac's skills as running back in football for [[Lowell High School (Massachusetts)|Lowell High School]] earned him scholarship offers from Boston College, Notre Dame, and Columbia University. He spent a year at [[Horace Mann School]], where he befriended Seymour Wyse, an Englishman whom he later featured as a character, under the pseudonym 'Lionel Smart', in several of Kerouac's books. He also cites Wyse as the person who introduced him to the new styles of jazz, including Bop.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Moore |first1=Dave |title=Kerouac — "My really best friend…" an interview with Seymour Wyse by Dave Moore |url=https://www.emptymirrorbooks.com/beat/seymour-wyse-interview |website=www.emptymirrorbooks.com |access-date=23 March 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Seymour Wyse: friend of Jack Kerouac |url=http://kilburnwesthampstead.blogspot.com/2020/12/seymour-wyse-friend-of-jack-kerouac.html |website=www.kilburnwesthampstead.blogspot.com |access-date=23 March 2021}}</ref> After his year at Horace Mann Kerouac earned the requisite grades for entry to Columbia. Kerouac broke a leg playing football during his freshman season, and during an abbreviated second year he argued constantly with coach [[Lou Little]], who kept him benched. While at Columbia, Kerouac wrote several sports articles for the student newspaper, the ''[[Columbia Daily Spectator]]'', and joined the [[Phi Gamma Delta]] fraternity.<ref>{{cite web|title=Phi Gamma Delta|url=http://www.wikicu.com/Phi_Gamma_Delta|publisher=Wiki CU|access-date=July 19, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| title=The Beat Generation in New York: A Walking Tour of Jack Kerouac's City| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-nt1xVR4SrAC&pg=PA8 |publisher=City Lights Books| access-date=July 23, 2011| isbn=978-0872863255| year=1997}}</ref> He also studied at [[The New School]].<ref name=hpo>{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Joyce|title=How the 'Beat Generation' Got Away from Kerouac|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joycejohnson/how-the-beat-generation-g_b_1958500.html|work=HuffPost|date=November 11, 2012}}</ref>

===Early adulthood===
[[File:Jack Kerouac Naval Reserve Enlistment, 1943.png|thumb|Kerouac's Naval Reserve Enlistment photograph, 1943]]
When his football career at Columbia ended, Kerouac dropped out of the university. He continued to live for a time in New York's Upper West Side with his girlfriend and future first wife, [[Edie Parker]]. It was during this time that he first met the [[Beat Generation]] figures who shaped his legacy and became characters in many of his novels, such as [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Neal Cassady]], [[John Clellon Holmes]], [[Herbert Huncke]], [[Lucien Carr]], and [[William S. Burroughs]].

Kerouac was a United States Merchant Marine from July to October 1942 and served on the [[SS Dorchester]] before her maiden voyage.<ref name=loss>[https://www.kerouac.com/the-profundity-of-loss/ "The Profundity of Loss"], ''[[The Beat Museum]] website'', August 31, 2020. Retrieved December 2, 2021.</ref> A few months later, the SS Dorchester was sunk during a submarine attack while crossing the Atlantic, and several of his former shipmates were lost.<ref name=loss/> In 1943 he joined the [[United States Navy Reserve]]s. He served eight days of active duty with the Navy before arriving on the sick list. According to his medical report, Kerouac said he "asked for an aspirin for his headaches and they diagnosed me [[dementia praecox]] and sent me here." The medical examiner reported that Kerouac's military adjustment was poor, quoting Kerouac: "I just can't stand it; I like to be by myself." Two days later he was honorably discharged on the psychiatric grounds that he was of "indifferent character" with a diagnosis of "[[Schizoid personality disorder|schizoid personality]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0906052_jack_kerouac_1.html|title=Hit The Road, Jack|work=[[The Smoking Gun]]|date=September 5, 2005|access-date=April 29, 2008}}</ref>

While a Merchant Marine in 1942, Kerouac wrote his first novel, ''[[The Sea Is My Brother]]''. The book was published in 2011, 70 years after it was written and over 40 years after Kerouac's death. Kerouac described the work as being about "man's simple revolt from society as it is, with the inequalities, frustration, and self-inflicted agonies." He viewed the work as a failure, calling it a "crock as literature" and never actively seeking to publish it.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/25/kerouacs-lost-debut-novel-published |title=Kerouac's Lost Debut Novel Published |work=The Guardian |date= November 25, 2011|access-date=December 6, 2011 |location=London |first=Stephen |last=Bates}}</ref>

In 1944, Kerouac was arrested as a [[material witness]] in the murder of David Kammerer, who had been stalking Kerouac's friend [[Lucien Carr]] since Carr was a teenager in St. Louis. William Burroughs was also a native of St. Louis, and it was through Carr that Kerouac came to know both Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg. According to Carr, Kammerer's homosexual obsession turned aggressive, finally provoking Carr to stab him to death in self-defense. Carr dumped the body in the Hudson River. Afterwards, Carr sought help from Kerouac. Kerouac disposed of the murder weapon and buried Kammerer's eyeglasses. Carr, encouraged by Burroughs, turned himself in to the police. Kerouac and Burroughs were later arrested as material witnesses. Kerouac's father refused to pay his bail. Kerouac then agreed to marry [[Edie Parker]] if her parents would pay the bail. (Their marriage was annulled in 1948.)<ref>{{harvnb|Knight|1996|pp=78–79}}</ref> Kerouac and Burroughs collaborated on a novel about the Kammerer killing entitled ''[[And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks]]''. Though the book was not published during their lifetimes, an excerpt eventually appeared in ''Word Virus: The William S. Burroughs Reader'' (and as noted below, the novel was finally published late 2008). Kerouac also later wrote about the killing in his novel ''[[Vanity of Duluoz]]''.

Later, Kerouac lived with his parents in the [[Ozone Park, Queens|Ozone Park]] neighborhood of Queens, after they had also moved to New York. He wrote his first published novel, ''[[The Town and the City]]'', and began the famous ''[[On the Road]]'' around 1949 when living there.<ref>{{cite web|author=Fenton, Patrick |url=http://www.wordsareimportant.com/ozonepark.htm |title=The wizard of Ozone Park |work=Dharma Beat |year=1997 |access-date=May 27, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225101624/http://www.wordsareimportant.com/ozonepark.htm |archive-date=February 25, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> His friends jokingly called him "The Wizard of Ozone Park", alluding to [[Thomas Edison]]'s nickname, "the Wizard of Menlo Park", and to the film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.<ref>{{cite news|author=Kilgannon, Corey |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/10/nyregion/10ink.html|title=On the Road, the One Called Cross Bay Boulevard|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 10, 2005|access-date=April 29, 2008}}</ref>

===Early career: 1950–1957===
[[Image:Jacks house3.JPG|thumb|Jack Kerouac lived with his parents for a time above a corner drug store in Ozone Park (now a flower shop),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&safe=off&num=100&um=1&ie=UTF-8&q=%22LITTLE+SHOPPE+OF+FLOWERS%22+%22Ozone+Park%22+Queens+%22New+York%22&fb=1&split=1&gl=us&cid=0,0,6055163161404423961&ei=rL37SfO0BZmSswOXo731AQ&sa=X&oi=local_result&ct=image&resnum=1 |title=LITTLE SHOPPE OF FLOWERS" "Ozone Park" Queens "New York|publisher=Google Maps |date=January 1, 1970 |access-date=November 21, 2013}}</ref> while writing some of his earliest work.]]

''[[The Town and the City]]'' was published in 1950 under the name "John Kerouac" and, though it earned him a few respectable reviews, the book sold poorly. Heavily influenced by Kerouac's reading of [[Thomas Wolfe]], it reflects on the generational epic formula and the contrasts of small town life versus the multi-dimensional, and larger life of the city. The book was heavily edited by [[Robert Giroux]], with around 400 pages taken out.

[[File:Jack Kerouac House, New York City, NY.jpg|thumb|454 West 20th Street]]
For the next six years, Kerouac continued to write regularly. Building upon previous drafts tentatively titled "The Beat Generation" and "Gone on the Road," Kerouac completed what is now known as ''On the Road'' in April 1951, while living at 454 West 20th Street in Manhattan with his second wife, [[Joan Haverty Kerouac|Joan Haverty]].<ref name="epic">{{cite web|author=Wolf, Stephen|url=http://www.thevillager.com/villager_238/anepic.html|title=An epic journey through the life of Jack Kerouac|work=[[The Villager (Manhattan)|The Villager]]|date=November 21–27, 2007|access-date=May 14, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706005254/http://thevillager.com/villager_238/anepic.html|archive-date=July 6, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> The book was largely autobiographical and describes Kerouac's road-trip adventures across the United States and Mexico with [[Neal Cassady]] in the late 40s and early 50s, as well as his relationships with other Beat writers and friends. Although some of the novel is focused on driving, Kerouac did not have a driver's license and Cassady did most of the cross-country driving. He learned to drive aged 34, but never had a formal license.<ref>{{cite news |last=Briere |first=Rachel R. |url=https://www.lowellsun.com/2006/10/06/you-dont-know-jack-about-kerouac/ |title=You don't know Jack about Kerouac |work=[[The Sun (Lowell)]] |date=2006-10-06 |access-date=2020-07-27 }}</ref>

Kerouac completed the first version of the novel during a three-week extended session of spontaneous confessional prose. Kerouac wrote the final draft in 20 days, with Joan, his wife, supplying him with benzedrine, cigarettes, bowls of pea soup, and mugs of coffee to keep him going.<ref name="amburn">{{Cite book|author=Amburn, Ellis |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bN0PJn6VCNIC&pg=PA164|title=Subterranean Kerouac: the hidden life of Jack Kerouac|date=October 5, 1999|access-date=September 28, 2010|isbn=9780312206772}}</ref> Before beginning, Kerouac cut sheets of tracing paper<ref name="sante">{{cite news|author=Sante, Luc |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/19/books/review/Sante2-t-1.html|title=On the Road Again|work=The New York Times|date=August 19, 2007|access-date=May 10, 2008}}</ref> into long strips, wide enough for a typewriter, and taped them together into a {{convert|120|ft|m|adj=on}} long roll which he then fed into the machine. This allowed him to type continuously without the interruption of reloading pages. The resulting manuscript contained no chapter or paragraph breaks and was much more explicit than the version which was eventually published. Though "spontaneous," Kerouac had prepared long in advance before beginning to write.<ref name="allthings">{{cite web|author=Shea, Andrea |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=14112461|title=Jack Kerouac's Famous Scroll, 'On the Road' Again|publisher=[[National Public Radio|NPR]]|date=July 5, 2007|access-date=April 29, 2008}}</ref> In fact, according to his Columbia professor and mentor [[Mark Van Doren]], he had outlined much of the work in his journals over the several preceding years.

Though the work was completed quickly, Kerouac had a long and difficult time finding a publisher. Before ''On the Road'' was accepted by Viking Press, Kerouac got a job as a "railroad brakeman and fire lookout" (see [[Desolation Peak (Washington)]]) traveling between the East and West coasts of the United States to earn money, frequently finding rest and the quiet space necessary for writing at the home of his mother. While employed in this way he met and befriended Abe Green, a young freight train jumper who later introduced Kerouac to [[Herbert Huncke]], a Times Square street hustler and favorite of many Beat Generation writers. 

Publishers rejected ''On the Road'' because of its experimental writing style and its sexual content. Many editors were also uncomfortable with the idea of publishing a book that contained what were, for the era, graphic descriptions of drug use and homosexual behavior—a move that could result in obscenity charges being filed, a fate that later befell Burroughs' ''[[Naked Lunch]]'' and Ginsberg's ''[[Howl]]''.

According to Kerouac, ''On the Road'' "was really a story about two Catholic buddies roaming the country in search of God. And we found him. I found him in the sky, in Market Street San Francisco (those 2 visions), and Dean (Neal) had God sweating out of his forehead all the way.

And once he has found Him, the Godhood of God is forever Established and really must not be spoken about."<ref name="culturewars.com"/> According to his biographer, historian [[Douglas Brinkley]], ''On the Road'' has been misinterpreted as a tale of companions out looking for kicks, but the most important thing to comprehend is that Kerouac was an American Catholic author – for example, virtually every page of his diary bore a sketch of a crucifix, a prayer, or an appeal to Christ to be forgiven.<ref name="weekendedition">{{cite web|author=Vitale, Tom |url= https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=14112461|title= 'On the Road' at 50|publisher=[[National Public Radio|NPR]]|date=September 1, 2007|access-date=February 28, 2011}}</ref>

In the spring of 1951, while pregnant, Joan Haverty left and divorced Kerouac.<ref>{{harvnb|Knight|1996|pp=88}}</ref> In February 1952, she gave birth to Kerouac's only child, [[Jan Kerouac]], whom he acknowledged as his daughter after a blood test confirmed it nine years later.<ref>{{cite book|author=Dictionary of Literary Biography |url=http://www.bookrags.com/biography/jan-kerouac-dlb/|title=Jan Kerouac Biography|work=[[Dictionary of Literary Biography]]|access-date=May 10, 2008}}</ref> For the next several years Kerouac continued writing and traveling, taking long trips through the U.S. and Mexico. He often experienced episodes of heavy drinking and depression. During this period, he finished drafts of what became ten more novels, including ''[[The Subterraneans]]'', ''[[Doctor Sax]]'', ''[[Tristessa]]'', and ''[[Desolation Angels (novel)|Desolation Angels]]'', which chronicle many of the events of these years.

In 1953, he lived mostly in New York City, having a brief but passionate affair with an African-American woman. This woman was the basis for the character named "Mardou" in the novel ''The Subterraneans''. At the request of his editors, Kerouac changed the setting of the novel from New York to San Francisco.<ref>{{cite book | first=James | last=Campbell | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xq-AZZ-zXkcC&pg=PA142 | title=This is the Beat Generation: New York, San Francisco, Paris | publisher=University of California Press |date=November 2001 | pages=138–139, 142 | isbn=0-520-23033-7}}</ref>

In 1954, Kerouac discovered Dwight Goddard's ''A Buddhist Bible'' at the [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] Library, which marked the beginning of his study of Buddhism. Between 1955 and 1956, he lived on and off with his sister, whom he called "Nin," and her husband, Paul Blake, at their home outside of Rocky Mount, N.C. ("Testament, Va." in his works) where he meditated on, and studied, Buddhism.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsobserver.com/entertainment/books/article10358366.html|title=The Road to Rocky Mount|work=newsobserver|access-date=August 14, 2018|language=en}}</ref> He wrote ''Some of the Dharma'', an imaginative treatise on Buddhism, while living there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aceswebworld.com/kerouac8.html|title=Jack Kerouac: All Roads Lead to Rocky Mount by Daniel Barth (pg 8)|website=www.aceswebworld.com|access-date=August 14, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dharmabeat.com/someofdharma.html|title=DHARMA beat - A Jack Kerouac Website|website=www.dharmabeat.com|access-date=August 14, 2018}}</ref> However, Kerouac had earlier taken an interest in Eastern thought. In 1946 he read Heinrich Zimmer's ''Myths and Symbols in Indian Art and Civilization''. In 1955, Kerouac wrote a biography of [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha Gautama]], titled ''Wake Up: A Life of the Buddha'', which was unpublished during his lifetime, but eventually serialized in ''[[Tricycle: The Buddhist Review]]'', 1993–95. It was published by Viking in September 2008.<ref>{{Cite book|title=''Wake Up!'' on Amazon.com}}</ref>

[[Image:Jack Kerouac House - Orlando Florida.jpg|thumb|House in [[College Park (Orlando)|College Park]] in Orlando, Florida where Kerouac lived and wrote ''[[The Dharma Bums]]'']]

Kerouac found enemies on both sides of the political spectrum, the right disdaining his association with drugs and sexual libertinism and the left contemptuous of his anti-communism and Catholicism; characteristically, he watched the 1954 Senate [[Army–McCarthy hearings|McCarthy hearings]] smoking marijuana and rooting for the anti-communist crusader, Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]].<ref name="culturewars.com"/> In ''Desolation Angels'' he wrote, "when I went to Columbia all they tried to teach us was [[Karl Marx|Marx]], as if I cared" (considering Marxism, like [[Sigmund Freud|Freudianism]], to be an illusory tangent).<ref>{{cite book|last=Fisher|first=James Terence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q08cuo8-7ggC |title=The Catholic Counterculture in America, 1933–1962|pages=216, 237|publisher=UNC Press|year=2001|isbn=9780807849491}}</ref>

In 1957, after being rejected by several other publishers, ''On the Road'' was finally purchased by [[Viking Press]], which demanded major revisions prior to publication.<ref name="allthings"/> Many of the more sexually explicit passages were removed and, fearing [[Defamation|libel]] suits, pseudonyms were used for the book's "characters." These revisions have often led to criticisms of the alleged spontaneity of Kerouac's style.<ref name="sante"/>

===Later career: 1957–1969===
In July 1957, Kerouac moved to a small house at 1418½ Clouser Avenue in the [[College Park (Orlando)|College Park]] section of Orlando, Florida, to await the release of ''On the Road''. Weeks later, a review of the book by Gilbert Millstein appeared in ''The New York Times'' proclaiming Kerouac the voice of a new generation.<ref name="nytreview">

Burroughs and [[Gregory Corso]], among others, became a notorious representation of the Beat Generation. The term Beat Generation was invented by Kerouac during a conversation held with fellow novelist [[Herbert Huncke]]. Huncke used the term "beat" to describe a person with little money and few prospects.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jack-Kerouac|title=Jack Kerouac {{!}} Biography & Facts|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=September 12, 2017}}</ref> "I'm beat to my socks", he had said. Kerouac's fame came as an unmanageable surge that would ultimately be his undoing.

Kerouac's novel is often described as the defining work of the post-World War II Beat Generation and Kerouac came to be called "the king of the beat generation,"<ref name="King">

The success of ''On the Road'' brought Kerouac instant fame. His celebrity status brought publishers desiring unwanted manuscripts that were previously rejected before its publication.<ref name="beatmuseum.org"/> After nine months, he no longer felt safe in public. He was badly beaten by three men outside the [[San Remo Cafe]] at 189 [[Bleecker Street]] in New York City one night. [[Neal Cassady]], possibly as a result of his new notoriety as the central character of the book, was set up and arrested for selling marijuana.<ref>{{harvnb|Suiter|2002|p=237}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Berrigan|1968|pp=19–20}}</ref>

In response, Kerouac chronicled parts of his own experience with Buddhism, as well as some of his adventures with [[Gary Snyder]] and other San Francisco-area poets, in ''[[The Dharma Bums]]'', set in California and [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and published in 1958. It was written in Orlando between November 26<ref name="suiter">{{harvnb|Suiter|2002|p=229}}</ref> and December 7, 1957.<ref>{{harvnb|Suiter|2002|p=233}}</ref> To begin writing ''Dharma Bums'', Kerouac typed onto a ten-foot length of teleprinter paper, to avoid interrupting his flow for paper changes, as he had done six years previously for ''On the Road''.<ref name="suiter"/>

Kerouac was demoralized by criticism of ''Dharma Bums'' from such respected figures in the American field of Buddhism as Zen teachers [[Ruth Fuller Sasaki]] and [[Alan Watts]]. He wrote to Snyder, referring to a meeting with [[D.T. Suzuki]], that "even Suzuki was looking at me through slitted eyes as though I was a monstrous imposter." He passed up the opportunity to reunite with Snyder in California, and explained to [[Philip Whalen]] "I'd be ashamed to confront you and Gary now I've become so decadent and drunk and don't give a shit. I'm not a Buddhist any more."<ref>{{harvnb|Suiter|2002|pp=242–243}}</ref> In further reaction to their criticism, he quoted part of Abe Green's café recitation, ''Thrasonical Yawning in the Abattoir of the Soul'': "A gaping, rabid congregation, eager to bathe, are washed over by the Font of Euphoria, and bask like protozoans in the celebrated light."

Kerouac also wrote and narrated a beat movie titled ''[[Pull My Daisy]]'' (1959), directed by [[Robert Frank]] and [[Alfred Leslie]]. It starred poets [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Gregory Corso]], musician [[David Amram]] and painter [[Larry Rivers]] among others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.photoeye.com/magazine/reviews/2008/05_21_pull_my_daisy.cfm|title=Is Pull My Daisy Holy?|date=August 8, 2008|access-date=September 13, 2013|first=John|last=Cohen|publisher=photo-eye Magazine}}</ref> Originally to be called ''The Beat Generation'', the title was changed at the last moment when [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] released a [[The Beat Generation|film by the same name]] in July 1959 that sensationalized beatnik culture.

The television series ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]'' (1960–1964), featuring two untethered young men "on the road" in a [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvette]] seeking adventure and fueling their travels by apparently plentiful temporary jobs in the various U.S. locales framing the anthology-styled stories, gave the impression of being a commercially sanitized misappropriation of Kerouac's story model for ''On the Road''.<ref name="Southern Illinois University Press">{{cite book|last1=Mills|first1=Katie|title=The Road Story and the Rebel; Moving Through FIlm, Fiction and television|date=2006|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|location=IL, USA|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KsfXQbGmBKsC&pg=PA76 |access-date=July 25, 2017|isbn=9780809388172}}</ref> Even the leads, Buz and Todd, bore a resemblance to the dark, athletic Kerouac and the blonde Cassady/Moriarty, respectively. Kerouac felt he'd been conspicuously ripped off by ''Route 66'' creator [[Stirling Silliphant]] and sought to sue him, CBS, the [[Screen Gems]] TV production company, and sponsor Chevrolet, but was somehow counseled against proceeding with what looked like a very potent cause of action.<ref name="Southern Illinois University Press"/>

John Antonelli's 1985 documentary ''Kerouac, the Movie'' begins and ends with footage of Kerouac reading from ''On the Road'' and ''[[Visions of Cody]]'' on ''[[The Steve Allen Show]]'' in November 1959. Kerouac appears intelligent but shy. "Are you nervous?" asks [[Steve Allen]]. "Naw," says Kerouac, sweating and fidgeting.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LLpNKo09Xk| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211029/3LLpNKo09Xk| archive-date=2021-10-29|title=Jack Kerouac on The Steve Allen Plymouth Show (1959)|date=November 13, 2008|access-date=October 22, 2015}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

In 1965, he met the poet [[Youenn Gwernig]] who was a [[Breton American]] like him in New York, and they became friends. Gwernig used to translate his Breton language poems into English so that Kerouac could read and understand them : "Meeting with Jack Kerouac in 1965, for instance, was a decisive turn. Since he could not speak Breton he asked me: 'Would you not write some of your poems in English? I'd really like to read them ! ... ' So I wrote an Diri Dir – Stairs of Steel for him, and kept on doing so. That's why I often write my poems in Breton, French and English."<ref>''Un dornad plu'', Youenn Gwernig, Al Liamm, 1997, page 10.</ref>

During these years, Kerouac suffered the loss of his older sister to a heart attack in 1964 and his mother suffered a paralyzing stroke in 1966. In 1968, Neal Cassady also died while in Mexico.<ref>[[Douglas Brinkley|Brinkley, Douglas]], ed. ''Kerouac: Road Novels 1957–1960''. New York: The Library of America, 2007. pp. 844–45.</ref>

Despite the role which his literary work played in inspiring the counterculture movement of the 1960s, Kerouac was openly critical of it.<ref name=hippiehate /> Arguments over the movement, which Kerouac believed was only an excuse to be "spiteful," also resulted in him splitting with Ginsberg by 1968.<ref>Gore Vidal quotes Ginsberg speaking of Kerouac: "'You know around 1968, when we were all protesting the Vietnam War, Jack wrote me that the war was just an excuse for 'you Jews to be spiteful again.'"

Also in 1968, Kerouac last appeared on television, for ''[[Firing Line (TV series)|Firing Line]]'', produced and hosted by [[William F. Buckley Jr.]] (a friend of his from college). He talked about the [[counterculture of the 1960s]].<ref name=hippiehate>{{cite web |url=http://faculty.uml.edu/sgallagher/Buckley.html |title=Digital Beats : Jack Kerouac |publisher=Faculty.uml.edu |access-date=November 21, 2013 |archive-date=January 18, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118221702/http://faculty.uml.edu/sgallagher/Buckley.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Death===
On the morning of October 20, 1969, in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]], Kerouac was working on a book about his father's print shop. He suddenly felt nauseated and went to the bathroom, where he began to vomit blood. Kerouac was taken to [[St. Anthony's Hospital (St. Petersburg, Florida)|St. Anthony's Hospital]], suffering from an esophageal hemorrhage. He received several transfusions in an attempt to make up for the loss of blood, and doctors subsequently attempted surgery, but a damaged liver prevented his blood from clotting. He never regained consciousness after the operation, and died at the hospital at 5:15 the following morning, at the age of 47. His cause of death was listed as an internal hemorrhage (bleeding [[esophageal varices]]) caused by [[cirrhosis]], the result of longtime alcohol abuse.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/10/what-hollywood-gets-wrong-about-jack-kerouac-and-the-beat-generation/280612/|title=What Hollywood Gets Wrong About Jack Kerouac and the Beat Generation|last=Larson|first=Jordan|work=The Atlantic|access-date=September 12, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/sporting-scene/football-and-the-fall-of-jack-kerouac|title=Football and the Fall of Jack Kerouac|last=Scheffler|first=Ian|date=September 6, 2013|work=The New Yorker|access-date=September 12, 2017|issn=0028-792X}}</ref> A possible contributing factor was an untreated hernia he suffered in a bar fight several weeks earlier.<ref name="collegian">{{cite web| url=http://digitalnewspapers.libraries.psu.edu/Default/Skins/BasicArch/Client.asp?Skin=BasicArch&&AppName=2&enter=true&BaseHref=DCG/1969/10/22&EntityId=Ar00402| title=Author Kerouac Dies; Led 'Beat Generation'| work=[[The Daily Collegian]]| date=October 22, 1969| access-date=April 29, 2008| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921165902/http://digitalnewspapers.libraries.psu.edu/Default/Skins/BasicArch/Client.asp?Skin=BasicArch&&AppName=2&enter=true&BaseHref=DCG%2F1969%2F10%2F22&EntityId=Ar00402| archive-date=September 21, 2008| url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="NYTimes">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/31/nyregion/31kerouac.html | title=For Kerouac, Off the Road and Deep into the Bottle, a Rest Stop on the Long Island Shore | work=The New York Times | date=December 31, 2006 | access-date=December 23, 2008 | first=Corey | last=Kilgannon}}</ref><ref name="Free Articles Directory">{{cite web | url=http://articlime.com/article135145-investigating-death-jack-kerouac.html#comment-9250 | title=Investigating the Death of Jack Kerouac | date=May 13, 2011 | access-date=February 16, 2012 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221100012/http://articlime.com/article135145-investigating-death-jack-kerouac.html#comment-9250 | archive-date=February 21, 2013 }}</ref> He is buried at [[Edson Cemetery]] in Lowell, Massachusetts.<ref>Wilson, Scott.

==Style==
Kerouac is generally considered to be the father of the Beat movement, although he actively disliked such labels. Kerouac's method was heavily influenced by the prolific explosion of
jazz, especially the [[Bebop]] genre established by [[Charlie Parker]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Thelonious Monk]], and others. Later, Kerouac included ideas he developed from his [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] studies that began with [[Gary Snyder]]. He often referred to his style as "spontaneous prose."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hunt|first1=Tim|title=The textuality of soulwork : Jack Kerouac's quest for spontaneous prose|date=2014|isbn=978-0-472-07216-3}}</ref> Although Kerouac's prose was spontaneous and purportedly without edits, he primarily wrote autobiographical novels (or ''[[roman à clef]]'') based upon actual events from his life and the people with whom he interacted.

[[Image:The air was soft the stars so fine the promise of every cobbled alley so great by Jack Kerouac - Jack Kerouac Alley.jpg|thumb|''On the Road'' excerpt in the center of [[Jack Kerouac Alley]] ]]
Many of his books exemplified this spontaneous approach, including ''On the Road'', ''Visions of Cody'', ''Visions of Gerard'', ''Big Sur'', and ''The Subterraneans''. The central features of this writing method were the ideas of breath (borrowed from jazz and from Buddhist meditation breathing), improvising words over the inherent structures of mind and language, and limited revision. Connected with this idea of breath was the elimination of the [[Full stop|period]], substituting instead a long connecting dash. As such, the phrases occurring between dashes might resemble [[improvisation|improvisational jazz]] licks. When spoken, the words take on a certain musical rhythm and tempo.

Kerouac greatly admired and was influenced by Gary Snyder. ''[[The Dharma Bums]]'' contains accounts of a mountain climbing trip Kerouac took with Snyder, and includes excerpts of letters from Snyder.<ref>{{harvnb|Suiter| 2002|p=186}}</ref> While living with Snyder outside Mill Valley, California, in 1956, Kerouac worked on a book about him, which he considered calling ''Visions of Gary''.<ref>{{harvnb|Suiter| 2002|p=189}}</ref> (This eventually became ''Dharma Bums'', which Kerouac described as "mostly about [Snyder].")<ref>{{harvnb|Suiter| 2002|p=228}}</ref> That summer, Kerouac took a job as a [[fire lookout]] on [[Desolation Peak (Washington)|Desolation Peak]] in the [[North Cascades]] in Washington, after hearing Snyder's and Whalen's stories of working as fire spotters. Kerouac described the experience in ''Desolation Angels'' and later in ''The Dharma Bums''.

Kerouac would go on for hours, often drunk, to friends and strangers about his method. Allen Ginsberg, initially unimpressed, would later be one of his great proponents, and it was Kerouac's free-flowing prose method that inspired the composition of Ginsberg's poem ''[[Howl]]''. It was at about the time of ''The Subterraneans'' that he was encouraged by Ginsberg and others to formally explain his style. Of his expositions of the Spontaneous Prose method, the most concise was ''Belief and Technique for Modern Prose'', a list of 30 "essentials".

Some believed that at times Kerouac's writing technique did not produce lively or energetic prose. [[Truman Capote]] said of it, "That's not writing, it's typing".<ref>{{cite book | title = Conversations with Capote | first = Lawrence | last = Grobel | publisher = Da Capo Press | page = 32 | isbn = 0-306-80944-3 | year = 2000 }}</ref> According to [[Carolyn Cassady]] and others, he constantly rewrote and revised his work.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shea|first1=Andrea|title=Jack Kerouac's Famous Scroll, 'On the Road' Again|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=11709924|publisher=NPR|access-date=July 20, 2017}}</ref>

Although the body of Kerouac's work has been published in English, recent research has shown that, in addition to his poetry and letters to friends and family, he also wrote unpublished works of fiction in French. The existence of his two novels written in French, ''La nuit est ma femme'' and ''Sur le chemin'' was revealed to the general public in a series of articles published by journalist Gabriel Anctil, in the Montreal newspaper Le Devoir in 2007 and 2008.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.ledevoir.com/lire/155613/les-50-ans-d-on-the-road-kerouac-voulait-ecrire-en-francais | title=Kerouac voulait écrire en français}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.ledevoir.com/lire/156026/kerouac-le-francais-et-le-quebec | title=Kerouac, le français et le Québec}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.ledevoir.com/lire/203916/sur-le-chemin |title = Sur le chemin}}</ref> All these works, including ''La nuit est ma femme'', ''Sur le chemin'', and large sections of ''Maggie Cassidy'' (originally written in French), have now been published together in a volume entitled ''La vie est d'hommage'' (Boréal, 2016) edited by University of Pennsylvania professor Jean-Christophe Cloutier. In 1996, the ''Nouvelle Revue Française'' had already published excerpts and an article on "La nuit est ma femme", and scholar [[Paul Maher Jr.]], in his biography ''Kerouac: His Life and Work'''', ''''' discussed Sur le chemin's plot and characters. The novella, completed in five days in Mexico during December 1952, is a telling example of Kerouac's attempts at writing in his first language, a language he often called Canuck French.

Kerouac refers to this short novel in a letter addressed to Neal Cassady (who is commonly known as the inspiration for the character Dean Moriarty) dated January 10, 1953. The published novel runs over 110 pages, having been reconstituted from six distinct files in the Kerouac archive by Professor Cloutier. Set in 1935, mostly on the East Coast, it explores some of the recurring themes of Kerouac's literature by way of a spoken word narrative. Here, as with most of his French writings, Kerouac writes with little regard for grammar or spelling, often relying on phonetics in order to render an authentic reproduction of the French-Canadian vernacular. Even though this work has the same title as one of his best known English novels, it is the original French version of an incomplete translation that later became ''Old Bull in the Bowery'' (now published in ''The Unknown Kerouac'' from the Library of America).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loa.org/news-and-views/1107-forthcoming-from-library-of-america-summer-fall-2016|title=Forthcoming from Library of America: Summer–Fall 2016 {{!}} Library of America|website=www.loa.org|access-date=April 26, 2016}}</ref> ''The Unknown Kerouac,'' edited by Todd Tietchen, includes Cloutier's translation of ''La nuit est ma femme'' and the completed translation of ''Sur le Chemin'' under the title ''Old Bull in the Bowery''. ''La nuit est ma femme'' was written in early 1951 and completed a few days or weeks before he began the original English version of ''On the Road'', as many scholars, such as Paul Maher Jr., Joyce Johnson, Hassan Melehy, and Gabriel Anctil<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.ledevoir.com/lire/155613/les-50-ans-d-on-the-road-kerouac-voulait-ecrire-en-francais | title=Kerouac voulait écrire en français |language=fr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.ledevoir.com/lire/156026/kerouac-le-francais-et-le-quebec | title=Kerouac, le français et le Québec |language=fr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.ledevoir.com/lire/203916/sur-le-chemin |title = Sur le chemin |language=fr}}</ref> have pointed out.

=== Influences ===
Kerouac's early writing, particularly his first novel ''The Town and the City'', was more conventional, and bore the strong influence of [[Thomas Wolfe]]. The technique Kerouac developed that later made him famous was heavily influenced by jazz, especially [[Bebop]], and later, Buddhism, as well as the famous Joan Anderson letter written by Neal Cassady.<ref>{{cite book | last =Cassady | first =Neal | author-link =Neal Cassady | title =The First Third | publisher =Underground Press | year= 1964 | page =387 | oclc =42789161}}</ref> The [[Diamond Sutra]] was the most important Buddhist text for Kerouac, and "probably one of the three or four most influential things he ever read".<ref>{{harvnb|Suiter| 2002|p=191}}</ref> In 1955, he began an intensive study of this sutra, in a repeating weekly cycle, devoting one day to each of the six [[Pāramitā]]s, and the seventh to the concluding passage on [[Samādhi]].

An often overlooked<ref>''To Be An Irishman Too: Kerouac's Irish Connection'', p. 371, Studies: an Irish quarterly review, Volume 92, Talbot Press., 2003</ref> literary influence on Kerouac was [[James Joyce]], whose work he alludes to more than any other author.<ref name="findarticles.com">Begnal, Michael, [https://web.archive.org/web/20111203004051/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3362/is_2_77/ai_n28721379/ "I Dig Joyce": Jack Kerouac and Finnegans Wake], Philological Quarterly, Spring 1998</ref> Kerouac had high esteem for Joyce and he often used Joyce's stream-of-consciousness technique.<ref name="findarticles.com"/><ref name="Encyclopedia of Beat Literature">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yzVV1Hl1NvAC |title=Encyclopedia of Beat Literature |page=244 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |year=2007 |isbn=9781438109084 }}</ref> Regarding ''On the Road'', he wrote in a letter to Ginsberg, "I can tell you now as I look back on the flood of language.

== Legacy ==
Jack Kerouac and his literary works had a major impact on the popular rock music of the 1960s. Artists including [[Bob Dylan]], [[The Beatles]], [[Patti Smith]], [[Tom Waits]], [[Grateful Dead|The Grateful Dead]], and [[The Doors]] all credit Kerouac as a significant influence on their music and lifestyles. This is especially so with members of the band The Doors, [[Jim Morrison]] and Ray Manzarek who quote Jack Kerouac and his novel ''On the Road'' as one of the band's greatest influences.<ref>"Jack Kerouac Biography | Jack Kerouac." Jack Kerouac. UMass Lowell, 2014. Web. April 29, 2014.</ref> In his book ''Light My Fire: My Life with The Doors'', [[Ray Manzarek]] (keyboard player of The Doors) wrote "I suppose if Jack Kerouac had never written ''On the Road'', The Doors would never have existed." The [[alternative rock]] band [[10,000 Maniacs]] wrote a song bearing his name, "Hey Jack Kerouac" on their 1987 album ''[[In My Tribe]]''. The 2000 [[Barenaked Ladies]] song, "Baby Seat", from the album [[Maroon (Barenaked Ladies album)|Maroon]], references Kerouac.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://songmeanings.com/songs/view/5198/|title=Song Meanings|access-date=June 2, 2019}}</ref>
Kerouac's sensibility and rock ‘n' roll each evolved from African-American influences.

As the critic Juan Arabia has written in relation to Kerouac's work and rock 'n' roll: {{Quote | text = In order to vindicate the cultural, ideological and aesthetic advancement in Kerouac's work and its relevance–and the genesis of rock ‘n' roll–one must first understand the origins of jazz and its offshoots.
The first forms of jazz were formed in New Orleans from a melange of blues, work songs, marches, work songs, African and European music. Bop–the form of jazz that most influenced Kerouac–was created by [[African Americans|African-American musicians]] in New York basements between 1941 and 1945.
Bop arose as a reaction to the perception of musical theft perpetrated by white entertainers (e.g., [[Benny Goodman]] and his swing band) in an attempt to reclaim the cultural property of the black community which had informed every popular music genre.
There has always been an exchange of ideas and musical forms between black and white communities. For example, [[Elvis]] sings gospel and blues and white country songs and some black rock n' roll artists sing in a manner similar to Elvis or borrow elements from European music or folk. Rock n' roll borrows elements from blues, country-western, [[boogie]], and jazz.
This is the scenario that surrounds the dénouement of Kerouac's work. It's in 1948 that he finishes his first novel, The Town and the City; very soon after came the birth–and its explosion of popularity in the 1950s–of rock ‘n' roll.<ref>{{cite web | last1 = Arabia | first1 = Juan | title = Beatnik / Kerouac and Rock 'n Roll: Two essays by Juan Arabia | website = Empty Mirror | url = https://www.emptymirrorbooks.com/beat/beatnik | date = 23 October 2016 | access-date = 1 October 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20201001162750/https://www.emptymirrorbooks.com/beat/beatnik | archive-date = 1 October 2020 | url-status = live }}

In 1974, the [[Jack Kerouac School|Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics]] was opened in his honor by Allen Ginsberg and [[Anne Waldman]] at Naropa University, a private Buddhist university in Boulder, Colorado. The school offers a BA in Writing and Literature, MFAs in Writing & Poetics and Creative Writing, and a summer writing program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.naropa.edu/academics/graduate/writingpoetics/index.cfm|title=The Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics|publisher=[[Naropa University]]|access-date=May 10, 2008|archive-date=May 16, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516010125/http://www.naropa.edu/academics/graduate/writingpoetics/index.cfm|url-status=dead}}</ref>

From 1978 to 1992, Joy Walsh published 28 issues of a magazine devoted to Kerouac, ''[[Moody Street Irregulars]]''.

In the mid-1980s, Kerouac Park was placed in downtown [[Lowell, Massachusetts]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Marion|first=Paul|title=Atop an Underwood|publisher=[[Penguin Group]]|page=xxi|date=1999}}</ref>

A street, ''rue de Jack Kérouac'', is named after him in Quebec City, as well as in the hamlet of Kerouac, [[Lanmeur]], Brittany. An annual Kerouac festival was established in Lanmeur in 2010.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kerouac|url=http://www.lanmeur.fr/index.php/vivre-a-lanmeur/patrimoine/214-kerouac|access-date=April 17, 2017|publisher=Ville de Lanmeur|language=fr-fr}}</ref> In the 1980s, the city of San Francisco named a one-way street, [[Jack Kerouac Alley]], in his honor in [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]].

The character Hank in David Cronenberg's 1991 film ''[[Naked Lunch (film)|Naked Lunch]]'' is based on Kerouac.{{citation needed|date= February 2021}}

In 1997, the house on Clouser Avenue where ''[[The Dharma Bums]]'' was written was purchased by a newly formed non-profit group, [[The Jack Kerouac Writers in Residence Project of Orlando, Inc.]] This group provides opportunities for aspiring writers to live in the same house in which Kerouac was inspired, with room and board covered for three months. In 1998, the Chicago Tribune published a story by journalist [[Oscar J. Corral]] that described a simmering legal dispute between Kerouac's family and the executor of daughter Jan Kerouac's estate, Gerald Nicosia. The article, citing legal documents, showed that Kerouac's estate, worth $91 at the time of his death, was worth $10&nbsp;million in 1998.

In 2007, Kerouac was posthumously awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from the [[University of Massachusetts Lowell]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uml.edu/Media/PressReleases/Commencement_2007.html|title=UMass Lowell Honors Jack Kerouac, U.S. Rep.

In 2009, the movie ''One Fast Move or I'm Gone – Kerouac's Big Sur'' was released. It chronicles the time in Kerouac's life that led to his novel ''[[Big Sur (novel)|Big Sur]]'', with actors, writers, artists, and close friends giving their insight into the book. The movie also describes the people and places on which Kerouac based his characters and settings, including the cabin in Bixby Canyon. An album released to accompany the movie, "One Fast Move or I'm Gone", features Benjamin Gibbard ([[Death Cab for Cutie]]) and Jay Farrar ([[Son Volt]]) performing songs based on Kerouac's ''Big Sur''.

In 2010, during the first weekend of October, the 25th anniversary of the literary festival "Lowell Celebrates Kerouac" was held in Kerouac's birthplace of Lowell, Massachusetts. It featured walking tours, literary seminars, and musical performances focused on Kerouac's work and that of the Beat Generation.

In the 2010s, there was a surge in films based on the Beat Generation. Kerouac has been depicted in the films ''[[Howl (2010 film)|Howl]]'' and ''[[Kill Your Darlings (2013 film)|Kill Your Darlings]]''. A feature film version of ''[[On the Road (2012 film)|On the Road]]'' was released internationally in 2012, and was directed by [[Walter Salles]] and produced by [[Francis Ford Coppola]].

==Works==
{{Main|Jack Kerouac bibliography}}

===Poetry===
While he is best known for his novels, Kerouac is also noted for his poetry. Kerouac said that he wanted "to be considered as a jazz poet blowing a long blues in an afternoon jazz session on Sunday.".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/1016 |title=Jack Kerouac- Poets.org – Poetry, Poems, Bios & More |publisher=Poets.org |access-date=November 21, 2013}}</ref> Many of Kerouac's poems follow the style of his free-flowing, uninhibited prose, also incorporating elements of jazz and Buddhism. "Mexico City Blues," a collection of poems published in 1959, is made up of 242 choruses following the rhythms of jazz. In much of his poetry, to achieve a jazz-like rhythm, Kerouac made use of the long dash in place of a period. Several examples of this can be seen in "Mexico City Blues":

{{poemquote|
Everything
Is Ignorant of its own emptiness—
Anger
Doesnt like to be reminded of fits—|fragment from 113th Chorus<ref>{{cite book |last=Kerouac |first=Jack |date=1959 |title=Mexico City Blues (242 Choruses) |publisher=Grove Press |page=113 }}</ref>}}

Other well-known poems by Kerouac, such as "Bowery Blues," incorporate jazz rhythms with Buddhist themes of [[Saṃsāra]], the cycle of life and death, and [[Samadhi]], the concentration of composing the mind.<ref name="poemhunter.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/bowery-blues-2/ |title=Bowery Blues by Jack Kerouac |publisher=Poemhunter.com |date=May 4, 2012 |access-date=November 21, 2013}}</ref> Also, following the jazz / blues tradition, Kerouac's poetry features repetition and themes of the troubles and sense of loss experienced in life.

===Posthumous editions===
In 2007, to coincide with the 50th anniversary of ''On the Road''{{'s}} publishing, Viking issued two new editions: ''On the Road: The Original Scroll'' and ''On the Road: 50th Anniversary Edition''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.today.com/popculture/uncensored-road-be-published-wbna14045410|title=Uncensored 'On the Road' to be published|publisher=[[Today.com]]|date=July 26, 2006|access-date=April 29, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author1=Bignell, Paul|author2=Johnson, Andrew|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/on-the-road-uncensored-discovered-kerouac-cuts-459446.html|title=On the Road (uncensored).

The text is more sexually explicit than Viking allowed to be published in 1957, and also uses the real names of Kerouac's friends rather than the fictional names he later substituted. [[Indianapolis Colts]] owner [[Jim Irsay]] paid $2.43&nbsp;million for the original scroll and allowed an exhibition tour that concluded at the end of 2009. The other new issue, ''50th Anniversary Edition'', is a reissue of the 40th anniversary issue under an updated title.

The Kerouac/Burroughs manuscript ''[[And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks]]'' was published for the first time on November 1, 2008, by [[Grove Press]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/Entertainment/2008/03/02/new_kerouac-burroughs_book_due_out/2264/|title=New Kerouac-Burroughs book due out|work=[[United Press International]]|date=March 2, 2008|access-date=April 29, 2008}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Previously, a fragment of the manuscript had been published in the Burroughs compendium, ''Word Virus''.<ref name="virus">{{cite book | last =Burroughs | first =William | author-link =William S.

Les Éditions du Boréal, a Montreal-based publishing house, obtained rights from Kerouac's estate to publish a collection of works titled ''La vie est d'hommage'' (it was released in April 2016). It includes 16 previously unpublished works, in French, including a novella, ''Sur le chemin'', ''La nuit est ma femme,'' and large sections of ''Maggie Cassidy'' originally written in French. Both ''Sur le chemin'' and ''La nuit est ma femme'' have also been translated to English by Jean-Christophe Cloutier, in collaboration with Kerouac, and were published in 2016 by the Library of America in ''The Unknown Kerouac''.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/jack-kerouac-s-rare-french-novels-to-be-released-by-canadian-publishers-1.2953512 | title=Jack Kerouac's rare French novels to be released by Canadian publishers | date=February 11, 2015 | publisher=CBC/Radio-Canada | access-date=February 15, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/unpublished-jack-kerouac-writings-to-be-released-1.2230909 | title=Unpublished Jack Kerouac writings to be released | work=Relaxnews | date=February 11, 2015 | agency=CTV News | access-date=February 15, 2015}}</ref>
