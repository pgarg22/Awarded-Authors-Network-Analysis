'''Tom Scott''' (6 June 1918 &ndash; 7 August 1995) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] poet, editor, and prose writer. His writing is closely tied to the [[New Apocalypse]], the New Romantics, and the [[Scottish Renaissance]].

Scott was born in [[Glasgow]], Scotland. During [[World War II]] he served in the British Army in Britain and Nigeria. After the war he received an M.A. with Honours in English Literature and a PhD from the University of Edinburgh. His first poems were published in 1941. Scott received an Atlantic Award for Literature in 1950 and traveled in France, Italy, and Sicily. During his travels he became interested in literature in Scots, his own native language, which shaped the direction of his work for the rest of his life.

He settled in Edinburgh and in 1953 married Heather Fretwell. He died on 6 June 1995 at the age of 77.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-tom-scott-1596211.html|title=Obituary: Tom Scott|author=William Cookson|date=13 August 1995|work=[[The Independent]]}}</ref>
