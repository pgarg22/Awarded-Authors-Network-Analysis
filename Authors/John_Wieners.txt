'''John Joseph Wieners''' (January 6, 1934 – March 1, 2002) was an American poet.<ref>[http://jacketmagazine.com/21/wien-petro.html "The Hipster of Joy Street"] ''Jacket 21'', [[Pamela Petro]], February 2003</ref>

==Early life==
Born in [[Milton, Massachusetts]], Wieners attended St. Gregory Elementary School in [[Dorchester, Massachusetts]] and [[Boston College High School]]. From 1950 to 1954, he studied at [[Boston College]], where he earned his A.B. On September 11, 1954 he heard [[Charles Olson]] read at the [[Charles Street Meeting House]] on [[Beacon Hill, Boston, Massachusetts|Beacon Hill]] during [[Hurricane Edna]]. He decided to enroll at [[Black Mountain College]] where he studied under Olson and [[Robert Duncan (poet)|Robert Duncan]] from 1955 to 1956. In 1957 he took a job sweeping floors at a popular Beat hangout in North Beach, where he joined the artistic community in the city. There he became close to painter Robert LaVigne and the collage artist [[Wallace Berman]] who was involved in the [[Beat Generation|Beat Movement]]. He then worked as an actor and [[stage manager]] at the Poet's Theater in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], and began to edit ''Measure'', releasing three issues over the next several years.

From 1958 to 1960 Wieners lived in San Francisco and actively participated in the [[San Francisco Renaissance|San Francisco Poetry Renaissance]]. ''The Hotel Wentley Poems'' was published in 1958, when Wieners was twenty-four. Subsequently, he was a contributor to [[Donald Allen]]'s seminal [[New American Poetry]] anthology.

Wieners returned to Boston in 1960 and was committed to a [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] hospital. In 1961, he moved to New York City and worked as an assistant bookkeeper at Eighth Street Books from 1962–1963, living on the [[Lower East Side, Manhattan|Lower East Side]] with [[Herbert Huncke]]. He went back to Boston in 1963, employed as a subscriptions editor for [[Jordan Marsh]] department stores until 1965. Wieners' second book, ''Ace of Pentacles'', was published in 1964.

In 1965, after traveling with Olson to the [[Spoleto Festival]] and the [[Berkeley Poetry Conference]], he enrolled in the Graduate Program at [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|SUNY Buffalo]]. He worked as a teaching fellow under Olson, then as an endowed Chair of Poetics,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~bjackson/englishdept.htm | date = 1999-02-26 | last = Jackson| first = Bruce| title = Buffalo English: Literary Glory Days at UB. | publisher = Buffalo Beat | access-date = 2007-07-31}}</ref> staying until 1967, with ''Pressed Wafer'' coming out the same year. In 1968, he signed the "[[Writers and Editors War Tax Protest]]" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.<ref>"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest" January 30, 1968 ''New York Post''</ref> In the spring of 1969, Wieners was again institutionalized, and wrote ''Asylum Poems''.

''Nerves'' was released in 1970, containing work from 1966 to 1970. In the early 1970s, Wieners became active in education and publishing cooperatives, political action committees, and the gay liberation movement.<ref name=udel>{{cite web |url=http://www.lib.udel.edu/ud/spec/findaids/wieners.htm |title=John Wieners Papers |work=[[University of Delaware]] Special Collections Department |date=September 1999 |access-date=2007-06-11}}</ref> He also moved into an apartment at 44 Joy Street on Beacon Hill, where he lived for the next thirty years.

In 1975, ''Behind the State Capitol or Cincinnati Pike'' was published, a magnum opus of "Cinema decoupages; verses, abbreviated prose insights." For the next ten years, he published rarely and remained largely out of the public eye.  In 1985, he was a [[Guggenheim Fellow]].

==Later life==
[[Black Sparrow Press]] released two collections edited by Raymond Foye: ''Selected Poems: 1958-1984'' and ''Cultural Affairs in Boston'', in 1986 and 1988 respectively. A previously unpublished journal by Wieners came out in 1996, entitled ''The Journal of John Wieners is to be called 707 Scott Street for Billie Holliday 1959'', documenting his life in San Francisco around the time of ''The Hotel Wentley Poems''.

At the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] in 1999, Wieners gave one of his last public readings, celebrating an exhibit by the painter [[Francesco Clemente]]. A collaboration between the two, ''Broken Women'', was also published.

Wieners died on March 1, 2002 at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] in [[Boston]], having collapsed a few days previously after an evening attending a party with his friend and publisher Charley Shively.

== Works ==
Wieners was a [[Beat Generation|Beat]] poet, and his poems combine accounts of sexual and drug-related experimentations. Like most Beat writers, Wieners included improvised influences of [[jazz]] in the lyrical structure of his works.

As a Beat writer, he used his writings to express his opinions on certain issues. One of them involving poverty and the working class. His poem, ''Children of the Working Class'' expresses the horror of children working intense jobs in order to help out their families and how these jobs affect them. Wieners' poem can be compared to [[William Blake]]'s poem ''[[The Chimney Sweeper]]'', in which they both call out the horrors of child labor.

Though a Beat writer, he isn't well known. In regards to Wieners, [[Allen Ginsberg]] said, "Wieners, in a way, is one of the greatest poets around, or, certainly, the most Romantic, and doomed, poet around, compared to everyone else, and he's not well known."

==Legacy==
''Kidnap Notes Next'', a collection of poems and journal entries edited by Jim Dunn, was published posthumously in 2002.

''A Book of Prophecies'' was published in 2007 from [[Bootstrap Press]]. The manuscript was discovered in the [[Kent State University]] archive's collection by poet Michael Carr. It was a journal written by Wieners in 1971, and opens with a poem titled ''2007''.

His papers are held at the [[University of Delaware]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lib.udel.edu/ud/spec/findaids/wieners.htm|title = Manuscript and Archival Collection Finding Aids}}</ref>

In September 2015, [[City Lights Bookstore]] & Publishers released ''Stars Seen in Person: Selected Journals of John Wieners'', which offers selections from four of Wieners' previously unpublished journals written between 1955 and 1969. These journals capture a post-war bohemian world that no longer exists, seen through the prism of Wieners' sense of glamour.

In October 2015, [[Wave Books]] published ''Supplication'' which was touted, at the time of its publication, as the first comprehensive selection of Wieners' poetry to have been published in 15 years.<ref>http://criticalflame.org/a-queer-excess-the-supplication-of-john-wieners/ A Queer Excess: the Supplication of John Wieners | The Critical Flame</ref>
