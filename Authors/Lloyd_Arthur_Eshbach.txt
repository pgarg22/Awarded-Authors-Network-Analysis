== Biography ==

Born in [[Palm, Pennsylvania|Palm]], [[Pennsylvania]],<ref>Over My Shoulder: Reflections On A Science Fiction Era, by Lloyd Arthur Eshbach, 1983, Oswald Train:Publisher, pp 29-31</ref> Eshbach grew up in [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]] in the same state. He discovered science fiction at age 15 and began writing letters to the professional magazines, then started to write his own stories. The third story he wrote sold to ''Science Wonder Stories'' in 1929. While still writing his own stories and articles, he published two short-lived magazines during the early 1930s, ''Marvel Tales'' and ''The Galleon''. He initiated [[Fantasy Press]], a small press which published the work of authors such as [[E. E. Smith]], [[Jack Williamson]], [[Robert A. Heinlein]] and [[John W. Campbell, Jr.]]. Fantasy Press published a total of 46 titles in its lifetime, with two additional fantasy titles published under the subsidiary imprint, Polaris Press.<ref>Over My Shoulder: Reflections On A Science Fiction Era, by Lloyd Arthur Eshbach, 1983, Oswald Train:Publisher, pp 360-364</ref> Fantasy Press books were produced in limited print runs averaging 3,750 copies each, with between 250 and 500 copies of each title bearing a limited plate inserted after the title page that was numbered and autographed by the book's author. These constituted the first hardcover editions of many of these works, previously available only in used copies of magazines.

Eshbach was a church publisher from 1958 to 1962,<ref>Over My Shoulder: Reflections On A Science Fiction Era, by Lloyd Arthur Eshbach, 1983, Oswald Train:Publisher, pp 137, 218</ref> then he was a salesman for the [[Moody Bible Institute]] until retirement in 1975. Upon his retirement, he became a pastor in the [[Evangelical Congregational Church]] and served churches of that denomination in Pennsylvania in [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster County]], Reading, and [[Womelsdorf]].

Eshbach was a lifelong science fiction fan, and besides creating Fantasy Press he was instrumental in assisting others in the creation and operation of their own fan or specialty presses, including William Crawford of Fantasy Publishing and later F.P.C.I. (Eshbach bought Crawford his first set of type for his press)<ref>Over My Shoulder: Reflections On A Science Fiction Era, by Lloyd Arthur Eshbach, 1983, Oswald Train:Publisher, pp 62-69</ref> and Thomas Hadley, of first The Buffalo Book Company and later Hadley Publishing Company (both of Providence, RI),<ref>Over My Shoulder: Reflections On A Science Fiction Era, by Lloyd Arthur Eshbach, 1983, Oswald Train:Publisher, pp 110-114</ref> whom Eshbach instructed and assisted with marketing and sales of his books and organization of his mailing list (which list eventually became the basis for the formation of a sales base for his own Fantasy Press).

His memoirs, ''Over My Shoulder: Reflections on a Science Fiction Era'', were published in 1983; and his last novel, ''The Scroll of Lucifer'', in 1990. Other books included ''The Armlet of the Gods'', ''The Land Beyond the Gate'', ''The Sorceress of Scath'' and ''[[The Tyrant of Time]]''. He also edited ''[[Of Worlds Beyond|Of Worlds Beyond: The Science of Science Fiction Writing]]'' (Reading, PA: Fantasy, 1947), the first book-length work on science fiction writing from a professional point of view.

An active member of science fiction's [[First Fandom]], he was Guest of Honor at the 1949 [[World Science Fiction Convention]] and the 1995 [[World Fantasy Convention]].
