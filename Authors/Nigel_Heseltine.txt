'''Nigel Heseltine''' (3 July 1916<ref>[http://www.shelwin.com/e/Ancestry/Heseltine/Heseltine_tree/aqwg07.htm#354 Descendants of Edward Heleltine, shelwin.com]</ref> – 1995) was an [[Welsh literature in English|English]] author of travel books, [[short stories]], [[Play (theatre)|plays]], and [[poetry]], as well as an [[agronomy|agronomist]] for the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the [[United Nations]].

==Biography==
Heseltine was born in [[London]] in 1916, the son of composer Philip Heseltine, better known as [[Peter Warlock]], and Minnie Lucy Channing, an occasional model for [[Augustus John]], nicknamed "Puma".  In his memoir ''Capriol for Mother'', however, Heseltine claims that his mother was a Swiss woman, a friend of Juliette Huxley. He spent most of his childhood in Wales with Warlock's mother and Welsh stepfather at Cefyn Bryntalch and attended Shrewsbury School. This led to the misconception that Heseltine himself was Welsh.

In 1937 he travelled on foot across [[Albania]] and wrote of his experience in ''Scarred Background''. In 1938 he married Natalia Borisovna Galitzine or Galitzina, an aristocrat in [[Budapest]]. He married four more times.<ref>Amongst these relationships, though not married to her, Jean Stoney, divorced from [[Louis le Brocquy]] in 1948.</ref> During [[World War II]] he was in [[Dublin]], working as a [[playwright]] for the [[Olympia Theatre (Dublin)|Olympia Theatre]] company of [[Shelagh Richards]] (1903–1985).<ref>[http://www.ricorso.net/rx/az-data/authors/h/Heseltine_N/life.htm Nigel Heseltine<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In the 1950s he was based in Rome working as an agronomist for the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. During this time he travelled widely across Africa, eventually settling in Madagascar for twelve years, and then on [[Rodrigues]] as Resident Commissioner. Later he wrote several books about Africa, including ''From Libyan Sands to Chad'' (an account of crossing the [[Sahara]]) and ''Madagascar''.

Towards the end of his career he was employed by the [[Department of Aboriginal Affairs (Western Australia)|Department of Aboriginal Affairs]] of [[Western Australia]], travelling extensively in the [[Outback]]. He retired in Perth, where he died in 1995.
