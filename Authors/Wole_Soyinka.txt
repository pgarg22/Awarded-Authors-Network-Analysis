He went on to write plays that were produced in both countries, in theatres and on radio. He took an active role in [[Nigeria]]'s political history and its campaign for independence from [[Colonial Nigeria|British colonial rule]]. In 1965, he seized the Western Nigeria Broadcasting Service studio and broadcast a demand for the cancellation of the Western Nigeria Regional Elections.<ref name=Ousting /> In 1967, during the [[Nigerian Civil War]], he was arrested by the federal government of General [[Yakubu Gowon]] and put in solitary confinement for two years.<ref name="Vistas">Theresia de Vroom, [http://www.lmu.edu/Page43404.aspx "The Many Dimensions of Wole Soyinka"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605123527/http://www.lmu.edu/Page43404.aspx |date=5 June 2013 }}, ''Vistas'', Loyola Marymount University.

Soyinka has been a strong critic of successive Nigerian (and African at large) governments, especially the country's many military dictators, as well as other political tyrannies, including the [[Robert Mugabe|Mugabe]] regime in [[Zimbabwe]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Soyinka|first=Wole|date=2017|title=The Critic and Society: Barthes, Leftocracy, and Other Mythologies|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/afa.2017.0113|journal=African American Review|volume=50|issue=4|pages=635–648|doi=10.1353/afa.2017.0113|issn=1945-6182}}</ref> Much of his writing has been concerned with "the oppressive boot and the irrelevance of the colour of the foot that wears it".<ref name=Ousting>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/nov/02/theatre.artsfeatures|author=Maya Jaggi |author-link=Maya Jaggi|title= Ousting monsters|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|date=2 November 2002|access-date=4 October 2016}}</ref> During the regime of General [[Sani Abacha]] (1993–98), Soyinka escaped from Nigeria on a motorcycle via the "[[National Democratic Coalition (Nigeria)|NADECO]] Route."

He said: "With the turbulence that characterised year 2020, and as activities wind down, the mood has been repugnant and very negative. I don’t want to sound pessimistic but this is one of the most pessimistic years I have known in this nation and it wasn’t just because of [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]].

==Life and work==

A [[Royal descent#Africa|descendant of the rulers]] of [[Isara-Remo|Isara]], Soyinka was born the second of seven children, in the city of [[Abẹokuta]], [[Ogun State]], in [[Nigeria]], at that time a [[British Empire|British]] Dominion. His siblings were Atinuke "Tinu" Aina Soyinka, Femi Soyinka, Yeside Soyinka, Omofolabo "Folabo" Ajayi-Soyinka and Kayode Soyinka. His younger sister Folashade Soyinka died on her first birthday. His father, Samuel Ayodele Soyinka (whom he called S.A. or "Essay"), was an Anglican minister and the headmaster of St. Peters School in Abẹokuta. Having solid family connections, the elder Soyinka was a cousin of the Odemo, or King, of Isara-Remo [[Samuel Akinsanya]], a founding father of Nigeria. Soyinka's mother, [[Grace Eniola Soyinka|Grace Eniola Soyinka (née Jenkins-Harrison)]] (whom he dubbed the "Wild Christian"), owned a shop in the nearby market. She was a political activist within the women's movement in the local community. She was also [[Anglicanism|Anglican]]. As much of the community followed indigenous [[Yorùbá mythology|Yorùbá religious tradition]], Soyinka grew up in a religious [[atmosphere]] of [[syncretism]], with influences from both cultures. He was raised in a religious family, attending church services and singing in the choir from an early age; however, Soyinka himself became an [[Atheism|atheist]] later in life.<ref name=":1">{{cite web|title= Wole Soyinka Biography and Interview |website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url=https://www.achievement.org/achiever/wole-soyinka/#interview|date=3 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Climate of Fear: The Quest for Dignity in a Dehumanized World|year=2007|publisher=Random House LLC|isbn=9780307430823|page=119|author=Wole Soyinka|quote=I already had certain agnostic tendencies—which would later develop into outright atheistic convictions— so it was not that I believed in any kind of divine protection.}}</ref> His father's position enabled him to get electricity and radio at home. He writes extensively about his childhood in his memoir ''[[Aké: The Years of Childhood]]'' (1981).<ref>{{cite book|title=Ake: The Years of Childhood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G2kwaeBgPmUC|date=1981|access-date=14 March 2015|isbn=9780679725404|author=Wole Soyinka}}</ref>

His mother was one of the most prominent members of the influential [[Ransome-Kuti family]]: she was the granddaughter of [[Josiah Ransome-Kuti|Rev. Canon J. J. Ransome-Kuti]] as the only daughter of his first daughter Anne Lape Iyabode Ransome-Kuti, and was therefore a niece to Olusegun Azariah Ransome-Kuti, Oludotun Ransome-Kuti and niece in-law to [[Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti]]. Among Soyinka's first cousins once removed were the musician [[Fela Kuti]], the human rights activist [[Beko Ransome-Kuti]], politician [[Olikoye Ransome-Kuti]] and activist [[Yemisi Ransome-Kuti]].<ref>Maya Jaggi, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/may/28/hayfestival2007.hayfestival "The voice of conscience"], ''The Guardian'', 28 May 2007.</ref> His second cousins include musicians [[Femi Kuti]] and [[Seun Kuti]], and dancer [[Yeni Kuti]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/femi-kuti-made-kuti-global-citizen-live-lagos/|title=How Femi and Made Kuti Are Keeping the Activist Heritage of Their Family Alive|website=Global Citizen|author= Akindare Okunola|date=24 September 2021|access-date=28 September 2021}}</ref>

In 1940, after attending St. Peter's Primary School in Abeokuta, Soyinka went to [[Abeokuta Grammar School]], where he won several prizes for literary composition.<ref name name=Ezebuiro>{{Cite web|last=Ezebuiro|first=Peace|date=10 November 2015|title=Wole Soyinka – Biography, Wife, Children, Family, Quick Facts|url=https://answersafrica.com/a-comprehensive-biography-of-the-famous-nigerian-writer-wole-soyinka-2.html|access-date=10 September 2020|website=Answers Africa}}</ref> In 1946 he was accepted by [[Government College, Ibadan|Government College]] in [[Ibadan]], at that time one of Nigeria's elite secondary schools.<ref name name=Ezebuiro />
After finishing his course at Government College in 1952, he began studies at [[University College Ibadan]] (1952–54), affiliated with the [[University of London]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ui.edu.ng/History|title=History|publisher=University of Ibadan|access-date=28 September 2021}}</ref> He studied [[English literature]], [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[Western history]].

Later in 1954, Soyinka relocated to [[England]], where he continued his studies in English literature, under the supervision of his mentor [[G. Wilson Knight|Wilson Knight]] at the [[University of Leeds]] (1954–57).<ref>{{Cite web|title=Wole Soyinka {{!}} Biography, Plays, Books, & Facts|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Wole-Soyinka|access-date=10 September 2020|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref> He met numerous young, gifted British writers. Before defending his B.A., Soyinka began publishing and working as editor for a satirical magazine called ''The Eagle''; he wrote a column on academic life, in which he often criticised his university peers.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/159945|title=Popular Literature for an African Elite|first=Bernth|last= Lindfors|journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies|volume=12|issue= 3 |date=September 1974|pages= 471–486|publisher=Cambridge University Press|doi=10.1017/S0022278X00009745|jstor=159945}}</ref>

===Early career===
After graduating with an upper second-class degree, Soyinka remained in [[Leeds]] and began working on an MA.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Wole Soyinka|author=James Gibbs|publisher=Macmillan|year=1986|isbn=9780333305287|location=Basingstoke|page=3}}</ref> He intended to write new works combining European theatrical traditions with those of his Yorùbá cultural heritage. His first major play, ''The Swamp Dwellers'' (1958), was followed a year later by ''[[The Lion and the Jewel]]'', a comedy that attracted interest from several members of London's [[Royal Court Theatre]]. Encouraged, Soyinka moved to [[London]], where he worked as a play reader for the [[Royal Court Theatre]]. During the same period, both of his plays were performed in [[Ibadan]]. They dealt with the uneasy relationship between progress and tradition in [[Nigeria]].<ref>[http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/s/wole_soyinka/index.html "Wole Soyinka"], ''The New York Times'', 22 July 2009.</ref>

In 1957, his play ''The Invention'' was the first of his works to be produced at the Royal Court Theatre.<ref>{{Cite book|title=African Biography|publisher=Gale|year=1999|isbn=978-0-7876-2823-9|location=Detroit, MI|publication-date=2 December 2006|chapter=Wole Soyinka}}</ref> At that time his only published works were poems such as "The Immigrant" and "My Next Door Neighbour", which were published in the Nigerian magazine ''[[Black Orpheus (magazine)|Black Orpheus]]''.<ref>[http://www.bookrags.com/tandf/soyinka-wole-1-tf/ "Wole Soyinka"], ''Book Rags'' (n.d.)</ref> This was founded in 1957 by the German scholar [[Ulli Beier]], who had been teaching at the University of Ibadan since 1950.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8508079/Ulli-Beier.html "Ulli Beier"] (obituary), ''The Telegraph'', 12 May 2011. Retrieved 17 April 2012.</ref>

Soyinka received a [[Rockefeller Foundation|Rockefeller Research Fellowship]] from University College in Ibadan, his alma mater, for research on African theatre, and he returned to Nigeria. After its fifth issue (November 1959), Soyinka replaced [[Janheinz Jahn|Jahnheinz Jahn]] to become coeditor for the literary periodical ''Black Orpheus'' (its name derived from a 1948 essay by [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], "Orphée Noir", published as a preface to ''Anthologie de la nouvelle poésie nègre et malgache'', edited by [[Léopold Senghor]]).<ref name=":2">Peter Benson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5gIQK1isP6cC&lpg=PR1&dq=transition%20orpheus&pg=PA30#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Black Orpheus, Transition, and Modern Cultural Awakening in Africa''], University of California Press, 1986, p. 30. {{ISBN|9780520054189}}.</ref> He produced his new satire, ''The Trials of Brother Jero'' in the dining hall at Mellanby Hall of University College Ibadan, in April 1960.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/educational-magazines/trials-brother-jero|title=The Trials Of Brother Jero|website=Encyclopedia.com|author=Alan Jacobs|access-date=28 September 2021}}</ref> That year, his work ''A Dance of The Forest'', a biting criticism of Nigeria's political elites, won a contest that year as the official play for [[History of Nigeria#Independence|Nigerian Independence Day]]. On 1 October 1960, it premiered in [[Lagos]] as Nigeria celebrated its sovereignty. The play satirizes the fledgling nation by showing that the present is no more a golden age than was the past. Also in 1960, Soyinka established the "Nineteen-Sixty Masks", an amateur acting ensemble to which he devoted considerable time over the next few years.<ref name="Case Histories: PEN America" />

Soyinka wrote the first full-length play produced on Nigerian television. Entitled ''My Father's Burden'' and directed by Segun Olusola, the play was featured on the Western Nigeria Television (WNTV) on 6 August 1960.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.premiumtimesng.com/entertainment/146108-essential-soyinka-timeline-uzor-maxim-uzoatu.html|author=Uzor Maxim Uzoatu|title=The Essential Soyinka Timeline|work=Premium Times|date=5 October 2013|access-date=10 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abiyamo.com/wole-soyinka-nigerias-first-nobel-laureate/7/|title=WOLE SOYINKA, Nigeria's First Nobel Laureate|website=Abiyamo |date=13 July 2013|access-date=28 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219113420/http://www.abiyamo.com/wole-soyinka-nigerias-first-nobel-laureate/7/|archive-date=19 December 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Soyinka published works satirising the "[[Nigerian Civil War#Background|Emergency]]" in the [[Western Region, Nigeria|Western Region]] of Nigeria, as his Yorùbá homeland was increasingly occupied and controlled by the federal government. The political tensions arising from recent post-colonial independence eventually led to a [[Nigerian Civil War#Military coups|military coup]] and [[Nigerian Civil War|civil war]] (1967–70).<ref name=":1" />

With the Rockefeller grant, Soyinka bought a [[Land Rover]], and he began travelling throughout the country as a researcher with the Department of English Language of the University College in Ibadan. In an essay of the time, he criticised [[Leopold Senghor]]'s [[Négritude]] movement as a nostalgic and indiscriminate glorification of the black African past that ignores the potential benefits of modernisation. He is often quoted as having said, "A tiger doesn't proclaim his tigritude, he pounces." But in fact, Soyinka wrote in a 1960 essay for the ''Horn'': "the duiker will not paint 'duiker' on his beautiful back to proclaim his duikeritude; you'll know him by his elegant leap."<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Obiajuru Maduakor|date=1986|title=Soyinka as a Literary Critic|journal=Research in African Literatures|volume=17|issue=1|pages=1–38|jstor=3819421}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://jimsligh.wordpress.com/2013/08/05/tigritude/|title=Tigritude|date=5 August 2013|work=This Analog Life|access-date=9 October 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> In ''Death and the King Horsemen'' he states: "The elephant trails no tethering-rope; that king is not yet crowned who will peg an elephant."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/standard-entertainment/article/2000086475/soyinkas-grumpy-battles-to-defend-literary-legacy|title=Nobel Laureate Wole Soyinka’s grumpy battles to defend literary legacy|author=Zakayo Amayi |date=22 June 2013|access-date=28 September 2021}}</ref>

In December 1962, Soyinka's essay "Towards a True Theater" was published. He began teaching with the Department of English Language at [[Obafemi Awolowo University]] in [[Ifẹ]]. He discussed current affairs with "négrophiles," and on several occasions openly condemned government censorship. At the end of 1963, his first feature-length movie, ''Culture in Transition'', was released. In 1965 ''The Interpreters'', "a complex but also vividly documentary novel",<ref>Douglas Killam and Ruth Rowe (eds), ''The Companion to African Literature'', Oxford: James Currey/Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2000, p. 275.</ref> was published in London by [[André Deutsch]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/interpreters/oclc/1842667|title=The interpreters|website=WorldCat|access-date=28 September 2021}}</ref>

That December, together with scientists and men of theatre, Soyinka founded the Drama Association of Nigeria. In 1964 he also resigned his university post, as a protest against imposed pro-government behaviour by the authorities. A few months later, in 1965, he was arrested for the first time, charged with holding up a radio station at gunpoint (as described in his 2006 memoir ''You Must Set Forth at Dawn'')<ref>Margaret Busby, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/may/26/biography.wolesoyinka "Marvels of the holy hour"] (review of ''You Must Set Forth at Dawn''), ''The Guardian'', 26 May 2007.</ref> and replacing the tape of a recorded speech by the premier of Western Nigeria with a different tape containing accusations of election malpractice. Soyinka was released after a few months of confinement, as a result of protests by the international community of writers.

===Civil war and imprisonment===
After becoming Chair of Drama at the [[University of Ibadan]], Soyinka became more politically active. Following the [[Nigerian Civil War#Military coups|military coup]] of January 1966, he secretly and unofficially met with the military governor [[Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu]] in the [[Mid-Western Region, Nigeria|Southeastern]] town of [[Enugu]] (August 1967), to try to avert [[Nigerian Civil War|civil war]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} As a result, he had to go into hiding.

<!---Unclear detail and possible NPOV interpretation. Please source and clean up this section. {{Confusing|date=May 2012}} He returned to Ẹnugu area to meet with Victor Banjọ, a Yorùbá who was working with Biafra. Banjọ told Soyinka that Biafra wanted "national liberation" for the whole of Nigeria. Soyinka sought the support of Western Region military leaders; in particular, he delivered Banjo's message directly to [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Olusegun Obasanjo]], who had recently been appointed as commanding officer for the [[Western Region, Nigeria|Western Region]]. Four evenings after Soyinka returned to the West, Biafran forces invaded the Midwest region, an area that previously maintained ''de facto'' neutrality.

Following the occupation of the Midwest, Soyinka met Obasanjo face-to-face to relay the goals of the Biafrans. Ọbasanjọ had already decided to align with the Nigerian federation. Biafra's invasion of the Midwest resulted in retaliation by federal government forces, and civil war began. Ọbasanjọ disclosed his meeting with Soyinka to his superiors, who declared the writer a traitor and sent out search parties to arrest him. They imprisoned him until the end of the war.*--->
He was imprisoned for 22 months<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/africa/07/27/wole.soyinka/index.html "Wole Soyinka: Nigeria's Nobel Laureate"], ''African Voices'', CNN, 27 July 2009.</ref> as [[Nigerian Civil War|civil war]] ensued between the [[Federal government of Nigeria]] and the [[Biafra]]ns. Though refused materials such as books, pens, and paper, he still wrote a significant body of poems and notes criticising the Nigerian government while in prison.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Despite his imprisonment, his play ''The Lion and The Jewel'' was produced in [[Accra]], Ghana, in September 1967. In November that year, ''The Trials of Brother Jero'' and ''The Strong Breed'' were produced in the Greenwich Mews Theatre in New York City. Soyinka also published a collection of his poetry, ''Idanre and Other Poems'', which was inspired by his visit to the sanctuary of the Yorùbá deity [[Ogoun|Ogun]], whom he regards as his "companion" deity, kindred spirit, and protector.<ref name="ReferenceA">Wole Soyinka 2006, ''You Must Set Forth at Dawn'', p. 6.</ref>

In 1968, the [[Negro Ensemble Company]] in New York produced ''Kongi's Harvest''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} While still imprisoned, Soyinka translated from Yoruba a fantastical novel by his compatriot [[D. O. Fagunwa]], entitled ''[[The Forest of a Thousand Demons: A Hunter's Saga]]''.

===Release and literary production===
In October 1969, when the civil war came to an end, amnesty was proclaimed, and Soyinka and other political prisoners were freed.<ref name="Case Histories: PEN America">{{Cite web|last=America|first=P.

He wrote ''[[The Bacchae of Euripides]]'' (1969), a reworking of the [[Pentheus]] myth.<ref name="K&R">Killam and Rowe (eds), ''The Companion to African Literature'' (2000), p. 276.</ref> He soon published in London a book of poetry, ''Poems from Prison''. At the end of the year, he returned to his office as Chair of Drama at Ibadan.

In 1970, he produced the play ''Kongi's Harvest'', while simultaneously adapting it as a film of the same title. In June 1970, he finished another play, called ''Madmen and Specialists''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} Together with the group of 15 actors of Ibadan University Theatre Art Company, he went on a trip to the United States, to the [[Eugene O'Neill Memorial Theatre Center]] in [[Waterford, Connecticut|Waterford]], Connecticut, where his latest play premiered. It gave them all experience with theatrical production in another English-speaking country.

In 1971, his poetry collection ''A Shuttle in the Crypt'' was published. ''Madmen and Specialists'' was produced in Ibadan that year.<ref>Christopher J.

In April 1971, concerned about the political situation in Nigeria, Soyinka resigned from his duties at the University in Ibadan, and began years of voluntary exile.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} In July in Paris, excerpts from his well-known play ''The Dance of The Forests'' were performed.

In 1972, his novel ''[[Season of Anomy]]'' and his ''Collected Plays'' were both published by [[Oxford University Press]]. His powerful autobiographical work ''The Man Died'', a collection of notes from prison, was also published that year.<ref>[https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1986/soyinka/biographical/ "Wole Soyinka | Biographical"], The Nobel Prize, 1986.</ref> He was awarded an [[Honoris Causa]] doctorate by the University of Leeds in 1973.<ref>[https://lucas.leeds.ac.uk/article/honorary-degree/ "Honorary Degree"], Leeds ''African Studies Bulletin'' 19 (November 1973), pp. 1–2.

In 1974, his ''Collected Plays, Volume II'' was issued by Oxford University Press. In 1975 Soyinka was promoted to the position of editor for ''[[Transition Magazine|Transition]]'', a magazine based in the [[Ghanaian]] capital of [[Accra, Ghana|Accra]], where he moved for some time.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} He used his columns in ''Transition'' to criticise the "negrophiles" (for instance, his article "Neo-Tarzanism: The Poetics of Pseudo-Transition") and military regimes. He protested against the military junta of [[Idi Amin]] in Uganda. After the political turnover in Nigeria and the subversion of Gowon's military regime in 1975, Soyinka returned to his homeland and resumed his position as Chair of Comparative Literature at the [[University of Ife]].

In 1976, he published his poetry collection ''Ogun Abibiman'', as well as a collection of essays entitled ''Myth, Literature and the African World''.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1986|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1986/soyinka/facts/|access-date=29 September 2020|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US}}</ref> In these, Soyinka explores the genesis of mysticism in African theatre and, using examples from both European and African literature, compares and contrasts the cultures. He delivered a series of guest lectures at the [[Institute of African Studies]] at the [[University of Ghana]] in [[Legon]]. In October, the French version of ''The Dance of The Forests'' was performed in [[Dakar]], while in Ife, his play ''Death and The King's Horseman'' premièred.

In 1977, ''Opera Wọnyọsi'', his adaptation of [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'', was staged in Ibadan. In 1979 he both directed and acted in [[Jon Blair]] and [[Norman Felton|Norman Fenton]]'s drama ''The Biko Inquest'', a work based on the life of [[Steve Biko]], a South African student and human rights activist who was beaten to death by [[apartheid]] police forces.<ref name=Encyclopedia.com /> In 1981 Soyinka published his autobiographical work ''[[Aké: The Years of Childhood]]'', which won a 1983 [[Anisfield-Wolf Book Award]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.anisfield-wolf.org/winners/ake-the-years-of-childhood/|title=Winners: 1983 Nonfiction – Ake|website=Anisfield-Wolf Book Awards|access-date=9 April 2021}}</ref>

Soyinka founded another theatrical group called the Guerrilla Unit. Its goal was to work with local communities in analysing their problems and to express some of their grievances in dramatic sketches. In 1983 his play ''Requiem for a Futurologist'' had its first performance at the University of Ife. In July, one of his musical projects, the Unlimited Liability Company, issued a long-playing record entitled ''I Love My Country'', on which several prominent Nigerian musicians played songs composed by Soyinka. In 1984, he directed the film ''Blues for a Prodigal'', which was screened at the University of Ife.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/03064228508533902|title=Wole Soyinka's film banned|work=[[Index on Censorship]]|date=1985|page=41|via=[[SAGE Journals]]}}</ref> His ''A Play of Giants'' was produced the same year.

During the years 1975–84, Soyinka was more politically active. At the University of Ife, his administrative duties included the security of public roads. He criticized the corruption in the government of the democratically elected President [[Shehu Shagari]]. When he was replaced by the army general [[Muhammadu Buhari]], Soyinka was often at odds with the military. In 1984, a Nigerian court banned his 1972 book ''The Man Died: Prison Notes''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xkJdDwAAQBAJ&q=%22the+man+died%22+soyinka+banned+1984&pg=PA17|title=Wole Soyinka|author=Gibbs|publisher=Macmillan|year=1986|isbn=9781349182091|pages=16–17}}</ref> In 1985, his play ''Requiem for a Futurologist'' was published in London by [[Rex Collings]].<ref name=jrank />

He was described as one "who in a wide cultural perspective and with poetic overtones fashions the drama of existence". Reed Way Dasenbrock writes that the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Soyinka is "likely to prove quite controversial and thoroughly deserved". He also notes that "it is the first Nobel Prize awarded to an African writer or to any writer from the 'new literatures' in English that have emerged in the former colonies of the British Empire."<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/40142439?refreqid=excelsior%3Aa64a93673a83062fde5767d88740cce2|title=Wole Soyinka's Nobel Prize |journal=[[World Literature Today]] |first=Reed Way |last= Dasenbrock |volume=61 |issue=1 |date=January 1987}}</ref> His Nobel acceptance speech, "This Past Must Address Its Present", was devoted to South African freedom-fighter [[Nelson Mandela]]. Soyinka's speech was an outspoken criticism of [[apartheid]] and the politics of racial segregation imposed on the majority by the [[National Party (South Africa)|National]] South African government. In 1986, he received the Agip Prize for Literature.

In 1988, his collection of poems ''Mandela's Earth, and Other Poems'' was published, while in Nigeria another collection of essays entitled ''Art, Dialogue and Outrage: Essays on Literature and Culture'' appeared.
