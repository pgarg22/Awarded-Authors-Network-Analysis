Thomas was born in [[Swansea]], [[Wales]], in 1914. In 1931, when he was 16, Thomas, an undistinguished pupil, left school to become a reporter for the ''South Wales Daily Post'', only to leave under pressure 18 months later. Many of his works appeared in print while he was still a teenager. In 1934, the publication of "Light breaks where no sun shines" caught the attention of the literary world. While living in London, Thomas met [[Caitlin Thomas|Caitlin Macnamara]]. They married in 1937 and had three children: Llewelyn, Aeronwy and Colm.

Thomas came to be appreciated as a popular poet during his lifetime, though he found earning a living as a writer was difficult. He began augmenting his income with reading tours and radio broadcasts. His radio recordings for the [[BBC]] during the late 1940s brought him to the public's attention, and he was frequently used by the BBC as an accessible voice of the literary scene.

Thomas first travelled to the United States in the 1950s. His readings there brought him a degree of fame, while his erratic behaviour and drinking worsened. His time in the United States cemented his legend, however, and he went on to record to [[Gramophone record|vinyl]] such works as ''A Child's Christmas in Wales''. During his fourth trip to New York in 1953, Thomas became gravely ill and fell into a coma. He died on 9 November 1953 and his body was returned to Wales. On 25 November 1953, he was interred at St Martin's churchyard in Laugharne.

Although Thomas wrote exclusively in the English language, he has been acknowledged as one of the most important Welsh poets of the 20th century. He is noted for his original, rhythmic and ingenious use of words and imagery.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Ciabattari |first1=Jane |date=21 October 2014 |url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20141016-dylan-thomas-rock-n-roll-poet|title=Dylan Thomas: Rock 'n' roll poet |publisher=bbc.com |access-date=10 May 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Notes on the imagery of Dylan Thomas|first1=Richard|last1=Morton|date=1 January 1962|journal=English Studies|volume=43|issue=1–6|pages=155–164|doi=10.1080/00138386208597117 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EVIGMyDkaNQC&pg=PA18|title=A Reader's Guide to Dylan Thomas|first1=William York|last1=Tindall|date=1 September 1996|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=9780815604013|via=Google Books |access-date=10 May 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |title=Dylan Thomas and the "Biblical Rhythm" |author=Moynihan, William T. |year=1964 |journal=PMLA |volume=79 |issue=5 |pages=631–647 |doi=10.2307/461150 |jstor=461150 }}</ref> His position as one of the great modern poets has been much discussed, and he remains popular with the public.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.walesartsreview.org/longform-dylan-thomas-a-great-poet/|title=Dylan Thomas: a Great Poet?|first1=John Idris|last1=Jones|date=27 August 2012|website=Wales Arts Review |access-date=10 May 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://poets.org/poet/dylan-thomas |title=About Dylan Thomas: Academy of American Poets |website=poets.org |access-date=10 May 2020}}</ref>

==Life and career==

===Early time===
[[File:Dylan thomas birthplace.jpg|thumb|upright|left|5 Cwmdonkin Drive, [[Swansea]], the birthplace of Dylan Thomas|alt=On a hill street stands a two-storeyed semi-detached house with bay windows to the front and a sloped tiled roof with a chimney.]]

Dylan Thomas was born on 27 October 1914 in [[Swansea]], the son of Florence Hannah (''née'' Williams; 1882–1958), a [[seamstress]], and David John Thomas (1876–1952), a teacher. His father had a first-class honours degree in English from [[University College, Aberystwyth]] and ambitions to rise above his position teaching English literature at the local [[grammar school]].<ref>FitzGibbon (1965), p. 10–11.</ref> Thomas had one sibling, Nancy Marles (1906–1953), who was eight years his senior.<ref Name="ONDB">{{cite web |first1=Paul |last1= Ferris |authorlink=Paul Ferris (Welsh writer) |title=Thomas, Dylan Marlais (1914–1953) (subscription needed)| work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edition| publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/ |access-date=29 August 2017}}</ref> The children spoke only English, though their parents were bilingual in English and Welsh, and David Thomas gave Welsh lessons at home.

The red-brick semi-detached house at 5 Cwmdonkin Drive (in the respectable area of the [[Uplands, Swansea|Uplands]]),<ref>http://www.dylanthomasbirthplace.com</ref> in which Thomas was born and lived until he was 23, had been bought by his parents a few months before his birth.<ref Name="CUP"/> His childhood featured regular summer trips to the [[Llansteffan]] peninsula, a Welsh-speaking part of Carmarthenshire,{{refn |At the 1921 census, 95% of residents in the two parishes around Fernhill were Welsh-speakers.

Thomas had [[bronchitis]] and [[asthma]] in childhood and struggled with these throughout his life. He was indulged by his mother and enjoyed being mollycoddled, a trait he carried into adulthood, and he was skilful in gaining attention and sympathy.<ref name="Ferris1989p25">Ferris (1989), p. 25.</ref> 

Thomas's formal education began at Mrs Hole's [[dame school]], a private school on Mirador Crescent, a few streets away from his home.<ref>Ferris (1989), p. 35. And see Hardy, J. A. (1995) ''At Dame School with Dylan'', ''New Welsh Review'', Spring no.28</ref> He described his experience there in ''Reminiscences of Childhood'':
<blockquote>
Never was there such a dame school as ours, so firm and kind and smelling of galoshes, with the sweet and fumbled music of the piano lessons drifting down from upstairs to the lonely schoolroom, where only the sometimes tearful wicked sat over undone sums, or to repent a little crime&nbsp;– the pulling of a girl's hair during geography, the sly shin kick under the table during English literature.<ref> Broadcast on March 21 1945 and reproduced in Maud.

In his free time, he joined the amateur dramatic group at the [[Dylan Thomas Theatre|Little Theatre]] in [[Mumbles]], visited the cinema in Uplands, took walks along [[Swansea Bay]], and frequented Swansea's [[pub]]s, especially the Antelope and the Mermaid Hotels in Mumbles.<ref>{{cite book|title=Dylan Thomas: The Pubs|first1=Jeff|last1=Towns|year=2013|publisher=Y Lolfa|isbn=978-1-84771-693-4|pages=73–84}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Where+Dylan+Thomas+'communed+with+his+legendary+creatures'.-a0145458555|title=Where Dylan Thomas 'communed with his legendary creatures'|first1=Robin|last1=Turner|publisher=thefreelibrary.com|work=Western Mail|date=6 May 2006|access-date=27 July 2012}}</ref> In the [[Kardomah Café]], close to the newspaper office in Castle Street, he met his creative contemporaries, including his friend the poet [[Vernon Watkins]].

===1933–1939===
Thomas was a teenager when many of the poems for which he became famous were published: "[[And death shall have no dominion]]", "Before I Knocked" and "The Force That Through the Green Fuse Drives the Flower". "And death shall have no dominion" appeared in the ''[[New English Weekly]]'' in May 1933.<ref Name="ONDB"/> When "Light breaks where no sun shines" appeared in ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]'' in 1934, it caught the attention of three senior figures in literary London, [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Geoffrey Grigson]] and [[Stephen Spender]].<ref Name="CUP">{{cite book|title=Cambridge Book of English Verse, 1939–1975 |year=1976 |first1=Alan Norman |last1=Bold |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=60 |isbn=978-0-521-09840-3}}</ref><ref>Ferris (1989), p. 91</ref><ref>Ferris (1989), p. 102</ref> They contacted Thomas and his first poetry volume, ''18 Poems'', was published in December 1934.

In those days, Thomas used to frequent the cinema on Mondays with Tom Warner who, like Watkins, had recently suffered a [[nervous breakdown]]. After these trips, Warner would bring Thomas back for supper with his aunt. On one occasion, when she served him a boiled egg, she had to cut its top off for him, as Thomas did not know how to do this. This was because his mother had done it for him all his life, an example of her coddling him.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lycett|first1=Andrew|title=Dylan Thomas: A New Life|publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson|location=London|isbn=0-75381-787-X|page=120|year=2004}}</ref> Years later, his wife Caitlin would still have to prepare his eggs for him.<ref>{{cite web|title=Discover Dylan Thomas's Life: Mother|url=http://www.discoverdylanthomas.com/life#|website=Discover Dylan Thomas|access-date=20 August 2016|quote=Florence was fiercely proud of her son's achievements and was desperately keen to protect her son. This did have its disadvantages. A friend of Dylan's, Tom Warner describes Dylan's first trip to his house, "the first time Dylan came, we noticed that he was just sitting in rather a helpless way with his egg untouched, and by general gestures we realised he wanted someone to take the top off for him-he'd never done it himself". Years later, his wife Caitlin would remove the tops off his eggs and would prepare him sugared bread and milk cut neatly into squares when he was ill, just as mam would have done. Despite her overindulgence, she had a strong bond with her children.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Janes|first1=Hilly|title=The Three Lives of Dylan Thomas|date=2014|publisher=The Robson Press|isbn=978-1849546881}}</ref>

In all, he wrote half his poems while living at Cwmdonkin Drive before moving to London. It was the time that Thomas's reputation for heavy drinking developed.<ref Name="Reckless2"/><ref>{{cite book|first1=George| last1=Tremlett |title=Dylan Thomas: In the Mercy of His Means| location=London |publisher=Constable |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-09-472180-7}}</ref>

During the politically charged atmosphere of the 1930s, Thomas's sympathies were very much with the radical left, to the point of holding close links with the [[Communism|communists]], as well as decidedly pacifist and anti-fascist.<ref name="Ellis">{{cite book |last1=Jackson |first1=Paul |editor1-last=Ellis |editor1-first=Hannah |title=Dylan Thomas: A Centenary Celebration |date=2014 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |pages=90–101 |chapter=Dylan Thomas: the Anti-Fascist Propagandist}}</ref> He was a supporter of the left-wing [[No More War Movement]] and boasted about participating in demonstrations against the [[British Union of Fascists]].<ref name="Ellis" />

===Wartime, 1939–1945===
In 1939, a collection of 16 poems and seven of the 20 short stories published by Thomas in magazines since 1934, appeared as  ''The Map of Love''.<ref>Ferris (1989), p. 177</ref> Ten stories in his next book, ''Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog'' (1940), were based less on lavish fantasy than those in ''The Map of Love'' and more on real-life romances featuring himself in Wales.<ref Name="ONDB"/> Sales of both books were poor, resulting in Thomas living on meagre fees from writing and reviewing. At this time he borrowed heavily from friends and acquaintances.<ref>Ferris (1989), pp. 178–180</ref> Hounded by creditors, Thomas and his family left Laugharne in July 1940 and moved to the home of critic [[John Davenport (critic)|John Davenport]] in [[Marshfield, Gloucestershire]].{{refn|Davenport was, for many years, literary editor of ''[[The Observer]]'' newspaper.

At the outset of the [[Second World War]], Thomas was worried about conscription, and referred to his ailment as "an unreliable lung". Coughing sometimes confined him to bed, and he had a history of bringing up blood and mucus.<ref>Thomas, D. N.

In February 1941, [[Swansea Blitz|Swansea was bombed]] by the [[Luftwaffe]] in a "three nights' blitz". Castle Street was one of many streets that suffered badly; rows of shops, including the Kardomah Café, were destroyed.

In five film projects, between 1942 and 1945, the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] (MOI) commissioned Thomas to script a series of documentaries about both [[urban planning]] and wartime patriotism, all in partnership with director [[John Eldridge (director)|John Eldridge]]: ''[[Wales: Green Mountain, Black Mountain]]'', ''[[New Towns for Old]]'', ''[[Fuel for Battle]]'', ''Our Country'' and ''[[A City Reborn]].''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discoverdylanthomas.com/works/screenplays|title=Discover Dylan Thomas's screenplays}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dylanthomas.com/dylan/dylans-work/dylan-thomas-filmscripts/|title=Dylan Thomas - The Filmscripts}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2005300/|title=New Towns for Old|date=2 April 2007|via=IMDb}}</ref>

In July 1944, with the threat of [[V-1 flying bomb|German flying bombs]] on London, Thomas moved to the family cottage at Blaencwm near [[Llangain]], Carmarthenshire,<ref>Ferris (1989), p. 200</ref> where he resumed writing poetry, completing "Holy Spring" and "Vision and Prayer".<ref>Ferris (1989), p. 201</ref> 

In September that year, the Thomas family moved to [[New Quay]] in Cardiganshire (Ceredigion), where they rented Majoda, a wood and asbestos bungalow on the cliffs overlooking Cardigan Bay.

Although Thomas had previously written for the BBC, it was a minor and intermittent source of income. In 1943, he wrote and recorded a 15-minute talk titled "Reminiscences of Childhood" for the Welsh BBC. In December 1944, he recorded ''Quite Early One Morning'' (produced by [[Aneirin Talfan Davies]], again for the Welsh BBC) but when Davies offered it for national broadcast BBC London turned it down.<ref name="Ferris 1989 213"/> On 31 August 1945, the [[BBC Home Service]] broadcast ''Quite Early One Morning'' and, in the three years beginning in October 1945, Thomas made over a hundred broadcasts for the corporation.<ref>Read (1964), p. 115</ref> Thomas was employed not only for his poetry readings, but for discussions and critiques.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dylanthomas.com/dylan/dylans-work/dylan-thomas-broadcasts/|title=Dylan Thomas&nbsp;– The Broadcasts|publisher=dylanthomas.com|access-date=22 July 2014}}</ref><ref>FitzGibbon (1965), pp. 395–399</ref>

In the second half of 1945, Thomas began reading for the BBC Radio programme, ''Book of Verse'', broadcast weekly to the Far East.<ref>Ferris (1989), p. 218</ref> This provided Thomas with a regular income and brought him into contact with [[Louis MacNeice]], a congenial drinking companion whose advice Thomas cherished.<ref name="Read 1964, p. 116">Read (1964), p. 116</ref> On 29 September 1946, the BBC began transmitting the ''[[BBC Third Programme|Third Programme]]'', a high-culture network which provided opportunities for Thomas.<ref>Ferris (1989), pp. 219–220</ref> He appeared in the play ''Comus'' for the Third Programme, the day after the network launched, and his rich, sonorous voice led to character parts, including the lead in Aeschylus's ''[[Agamemnon (play)|Agamemnon]]'' and Satan in an adaptation of ''[[Paradise Lost]]''.<ref name="Read 1964, p. 116"/><ref>FitzGibbon (1965), pp. 396–397</ref> Thomas remained a popular guest on radio talk shows for the BBC, who regarded him as "useful should a younger generation poet be needed".<ref>Ferris (1989), p. 219</ref> He had an uneasy relationship with BBC management and a staff job was never an option, with drinking cited as the problem.<ref>Ferris (1989), p. 221</ref> Despite this, Thomas became a familiar radio voice and within Britain was "in every sense a celebrity".<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.questia.com/library/1G1-18167167/the-ambiguous-reversal-of-dylan-thomas-s-in-country|title=The Ambiguous Reversal of Dylan Thomas's "In Country Sleep."|first1=James J.|last1=Balakier|year=1996|journal=Papers on Language & Literature|volume=32|issue=1|pages=21|access-date=26 August 2017|archive-date=26 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626231832/http://www.questia.com/library/1G1-18167167/the-ambiguous-reversal-of-dylan-thomas-s-in-country|url-status=dead}}</ref>

By late September 1945, the Thomases had left Wales and were living with various friends in London.<ref>Ferris (1989), p. 216</ref> In December, they moved to Oxford to live in a summerhouse on the banks of the Cherwell. It belonged to the historian, A.J.P. Taylor. His wife, Margaret, would prove to be Thomas’ most committed patron.<ref> Ferris, P. (1999) p208</ref> 

The publication of ''[[Deaths and Entrances]]'' in February 1946 was a major turning point for Thomas. Poet and critic [[Walter J. Turner]] commented in ''[[The Spectator]]'', "This book alone, in my opinion, ranks him as a major poet".<ref>{{cite book|first1=W. J. |last1=Turner |publisher=[[The Spectator]]| title=The Spectator| volume=176 |year=1946}}</ref>

The following year, in April 1947, the Thomases travelled to Italy, after Thomas had been awarded a Society of Authors scholarship. They stayed first in villas near Rapallo and then Florence, before moving to a hotel in Rio Marina on the island of Elba.<ref> For interviews with those writers who knew Thomas in Italy, see Thomas, D, N. (2004) pp104-124</ref> On their return Thomas and family moved, in September 1947, into the Manor House in [[South Leigh]], just west of Oxford, found for him by Margaret Taylor. He continued with his work for the BBC, completed a number of film scripts and worked further on his ideas for ''Under Milk Wood''. <ref> [https://sites.google.com/site/dylanthomasandsouthleigh/home Dylan Thomas and South Leigh]</ref>

In March 1949, Thomas travelled to Prague. He had been invited by the Czech government to attend the inauguration of the Czechoslovak Writers’ Union. In her memoir, [[Jiřina Hauková]], who was Dylan's guide and interpreter, recalls that Dylan "narrated the first version of his radio play Under Milk Wood." She describes how he outlined the plot about a town that was declared insane, and then portrayed the predicament of the eccentric organist and the baker with two wives. <ref> J. Hauková (1996) Záblesky života, H & H:Jinočany</ref> 

A month later, in May 1949, Thomas and his family moved to his final home, the [[Dylan Thomas Boathouse|Boat House]] at Laugharne, purchased for him at a cost of £2,500 in April 1949 by Margaret Taylor.<ref>Ferris (1989), p.239</ref> Thomas acquired a garage a hundred yards from the house on a cliff ledge which he turned into his writing shed, and where he wrote several of his most acclaimed poems.<ref name="Writing shed">{{cite web|url=http://www.dylanthomasboathouse.com/english/boathouse/shed.html |title=The Writing Shed| access-date=25 July 2012|work=dylanthomasboathouse.com}}</ref> Just before moving into there, Thomas rented "Pelican House" opposite his regular drinking den, [[Brown's Hotel (Laugharne)|Brown's Hotel]], for his parents<ref>Ferris (1989), p. 240</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/nature/sites/walking/pages/sw_laugharne.shtml|title=Laugharne|access-date=27 July 2012|publisher=BBC}}</ref> who lived there from 1949 until 1953.

Thomas, C. (1986), p. 112</ref> In October, the Australian poet, [[Allen Curnow]], came to visit Thomas at the Boat House, who took him to his writing shed and "fished out a draft to show me of the unfinished ''Under Milk Wood''" that was, says Curnow, titled ''The Town That Was Mad''. <ref> Curnow, A.

===American tours, 1950–1953===
American poet [[John Malcolm Brinnin|John Brinnin]] invited Thomas to New York, where in 1950 they embarked on a lucrative three-month tour of arts centres and campuses.<ref>Ferris (1989), pp. 243–250</ref> The tour, which began in front of an audience of a thousand at the Kaufmann Auditorium of the Poetry Centre in New York, took in about 40 venues.<ref>Ferris (1989), p. 251</ref><ref>FitzGibbon (1965), pp. 403–406</ref><ref group="nb">FitzGibbon, in his 1965 biography, lists 39 venues visited in the first U.S. trip, compiled with the help of John Brinnin, but accepts that some locations may have been missed.</ref> During the tour, Thomas was invited to many parties and functions and on several occasions became drunk – going out of his way to shock people – and was a difficult guest.<ref>Ferris (1989), pp. 252–254</ref> Thomas drank before some of his readings, though it is argued he may have pretended to be more affected by it than he actually was.<ref>Ferris (1989), p. 255</ref> The writer [[Elizabeth Hardwick (writer)|Elizabeth Hardwick]] recalled how intoxicating a performer he was and how the tension would build before a performance: "Would he arrive only to break down on the stage? Would some dismaying scene take place at the faculty party? Would he be offensive, violent, obscene?"<ref Name="Reckless1"/> Caitlin said in her memoir, "Nobody ever needed encouragement less, and he was drowned in it."<ref Name="Reckless1"/>

On returning to Britain, Thomas began work on two further poems, "In the white giant's thigh", which he read on the ''Third Programme'' in September 1950, and the incomplete "In country heaven".<ref>Ferris (1989), pp. 279–280</ref> In October, Thomas sent a draft of the first 39 pages of the 'The Town That Was Mad' to the BBC.<ref>Ferris, P. (2000) ''Collected Letters'', p860</ref> The task of seeing this work through to production was assigned to the BBC's [[Douglas Cleverdon]], who had been responsible for casting Thomas in 'Paradise Lost'.<ref>Ferris (1989), p. 280</ref> Despite Cleverdon's urgings, the script slipped from Thomas's priorities and in early 1951 he took a trip to [[Iran]] to work on a film for the [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]]. The film was never made, with Thomas returning to Wales in February, though his time there allowed him to provide a few minutes of material for a BBC documentary, 'Persian Oil'.<ref>Ferris (1989), pp. 281–282</ref> Early that year, Thomas wrote two poems, which Thomas's principal biographer, Paul Ferris, describes as "unusually blunt"; the ribald "Lament" and an ode, in the form of a [[villanelle]], to his dying father "[[Do not go gentle into that good night]]".<ref>Ferris (1989), pp. 282–283</ref>

Despite a range of wealthy patrons, including Margaret Taylor, Princess Marguerite [[Caetani]] and Marged Howard-Stepney, Thomas was still in financial difficulty, and he wrote several begging letters to notable literary figures including the likes of [[T. S. Eliot]].<ref>Ferris (1989), p. 285</ref> Taylor was not keen on Thomas taking another trip to the United States, and thought that if he had a permanent address in London he would be able to gain steady work there.<ref>Ferris (1989), p. 287</ref> She bought a property, 54 Delancey Street, in [[Camden Town]], and in late 1951 Thomas and Caitlin lived in the basement flat.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://openplaques.org/plaques/592 | title= Dylan Thomas blue plaque in London | publisher= openplaques.org | access-date= 4 May 2013}}</ref> Thomas would describe the flat as his "London house of horror" and did not return there after his 1952 tour of America.<ref>{{cite book |title= Literary London: A Street by Street Exploration of the Capital's Literary Heritage |first1= Ed|last1= Glinert|isbn= 978-0-14-190159-6|publisher= Penguin|year= 2007}}</ref>

Thomas undertook a second tour of the United States in 1952, this time with Caitlin – after she had discovered he had been unfaithful on his earlier trip.<ref>Ferris (1989), pp.&nbsp;286–287, p. 296</ref> They drank heavily, and Thomas began to suffer with [[gout]] and [[Respiratory distress|lung problems]]. The second tour was the most intensive of the four, taking in 46 engagements.<ref>FitzGibbon (1965), pp. 403–410</ref> The trip also resulted in Thomas recording his first poetry to vinyl, which [[Caedmon Audio|Caedmon Records]] released in America later that year.<ref>Ferris (1989) p. 301</ref> One of his works recorded during this time, ''[[A Child's Christmas in Wales]]'', became his most popular prose work in America.<ref name="Ferris 1989, p. 214"/> The original 1952 recording of ''A Child's Christmas in Wales'' was a 2008 selection for the [[United States National Recording Registry]], stating that it is "credited with launching the [[audiobook]] industry in the United States".<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.loc.gov/rr/record/nrpb/registry/nrpb-2008reg.html |title= The National Recording Registry 2008 | access-date= 16 July 2012 | work= National Recording Preservation Board of the Library of Congress | publisher= The Library of Congress}}</ref>

In April 1953, Thomas returned alone for a third tour of America.<ref>Ferris (1989), p. 316</ref> He performed a "work in progress" version of ''Under Milk Wood'', solo, for the first time at [[Harvard University]] on 3 May.<ref>FitzGibbon (1965), p. 385</ref> A week later, the work was performed with a full cast at the Poetry Centre in New York. He met the deadline only after being locked in a room by Brinnin's assistant, Liz Reitell, and was still editing the script on the afternoon of the performance; its last lines were handed to the actors as they put on their makeup.<ref>Thomas, D. N. (2008), p. 33</ref><ref Name="Bold61"/>

During this penultimate tour, Thomas met the composer [[Stravinsky|Igor Stravinsky]] who had become an admirer after having been introduced to his poetry by [[W. H. Auden]]. They had discussions about collaborating on a "musical theatrical work" for which Thomas would provide the libretto on the theme of "the rediscovery of love and language in what might be left after the world after the bomb." The shock of Thomas's death later in the year moved Stravinsky to compose his ''In Memoriam Dylan Thomas'' for tenor, string quartet and four trombones. The  first performance in [[Los Angeles]] in 1954 was introduced with a tribute to Thomas from [[Aldous Huxley]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Craft |first1=Robert |author-link=Robert Craft |title=Stravinsky: Glimpses of a Life |location=London |publisher=Lime Tree |year=1992 |pages=52–60 |isbn=978-0413454614}}</ref>

Thomas spent the last nine or ten days of his third tour in New York mostly in the company of Reitell, with whom he had an affair.<ref name="Ferris1989p321">Ferris (1989), p. 321</ref> During this time, Thomas fractured his arm falling down a flight of stairs when drunk. Reitell's doctor, Milton Feltenstein, put his arm in plaster and treated him for gout and gastritis.<ref name="Ferris1989p321"/>

After returning home, Thomas worked on ''Under Milk Wood'' in Wales before sending the original manuscript to Douglas Cleverdon on 15 October 1953.

Thomas left Laugharne on 9 October 1953 on the first leg of his trip to America. He called on his mother, Florence, to say goodbye: "He always felt that he had to get out from this country because of his chest being so bad."<ref name="Thomas, D. N. 2008 p46">Thomas, D. N. (2008) p46</ref> Thomas had suffered from chest problems for most of his life, though they began in earnest soon after he moved in May 1949 to the Boat House at Laugharne – the "bronchial heronry", as he called it.<ref>Letter to Oscar Williams, October 8, 1952, in Ferris, 2000</ref> Within weeks of moving in, he visited a local doctor, who prescribed medicine for both his chest and throat.<ref>Thomas, D.

Whilst waiting in London before his flight in October 1953, Thomas stayed with the comedian Harry Locke and worked on ''Under Milk Wood''. Locke noted that Thomas was having trouble with his chest, "terrible" coughing fits that made him go purple in the face.<ref name="Thomas, D. N. 2008 p46"/> He was also using an inhaler to help his breathing. There were reports, too, that Thomas was also having blackouts. His visit to the BBC producer Philip Burton, a few days before he left for New York, was interrupted by a blackout. On his last night in London, he had another in the company of his fellow poet Louis MacNeice.<ref>Both the Burton and MacNeice blackouts are reported by Burton in Thomas, D. N. (2004) pp237-238.</ref>

Thomas arrived in New York on 20 October 1953 to undertake further performances of ''Under Milk Wood'', organised by John Brinnin, his American agent and Director of the Poetry Centre. Brinnin did not travel to New York but remained in [[Boston]] to write.<ref name="Fatal Neglect">{{cite web|url= http://www.freewebs.com/deathofdylanthomas/|title= Fatal Neglect: Who Killed Dylan Thomas?|first1= David N.|last1= Thomas|access-date= 31 July 2012|publisher= freewebs.com}}</ref> He handed responsibility to his assistant, Liz Reitell, who was keen to see Thomas for the first time since their three-week romance early in the year. She met Thomas at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|Idlewild Airport]] and was shocked at his appearance. He looked pale, delicate and shaky, not his usual robust self: "He was very ill when he got here."<ref name="Thomas, D. N. 2008 p57">Thomas, D. N. (2008) p57</ref> After being taken by Reitell to check in at the [[Hotel Chelsea|Chelsea Hotel]], Thomas took the first rehearsal of ''Under Milk Wood''. They then went to the [[White Horse Tavern (New York City)|White Horse Tavern]] in Greenwich Village, before returning to the Chelsea Hotel.<ref>Thomas, D. N. (2008)</ref>

The next day, Reitell invited him to her apartment, but he declined. They went sightseeing, but Thomas felt unwell and retired to his bed for the rest of the afternoon. Reitell gave him half a [[Grain (unit)|grain]] (32.4 milligrams) of [[phenobarbitone]] to help him sleep and spent the night at the hotel with him. Two days later, on 23 October, at the third rehearsal, Thomas said he was too ill to take part, but he struggled on, shivering and burning with fever, before collapsing on the stage.

The next day, 24 October, Reitell took Thomas to see her doctor, Milton Feltenstein, who administered cortisone injections and Thomas made it through the first performance that evening, but collapsed immediately afterwards.<ref>Thomas, D. N. (2008) p56</ref> "This circus out there," he told a friend who had come back-stage, "has taken the life out of me for now."<ref>Thomas, D. N. (2008), p60</ref> Reitell later said" that Feltenstein was "rather a wild doctor who thought injections would cure anything".<ref>Ferris (1989), pp. 336–337</ref>

At the next performance on 25 October, his fellow actors realised that Thomas was very ill: “He was desperately ill…we didn’t think that he would be able to do the last performance because he was so ill…Dylan literally couldn’t speak he was so ill…still my greatest memory of it is that he had no voice.” <ref>Thomas, D. N. Thomas (2008), p60-61</ref>

On the evening of 27 October, Thomas attended his 39th birthday party but felt unwell and returned to his hotel after an hour.<ref name="Ferris1989p332">Ferris (1989), p. 332</ref> The next day, he took part in ''Poetry and the Film'', a recorded symposium at [[Cinema 16]].

A turning point came on 2 November. [[Smog|Air pollution]] in New York had risen significantly and exacerbated chest illnesses such as Thomas had. By the end of the month, over 200 New Yorkers had died from the smog.<ref>See Greenberg et. al. (1962)</ref><ref name="Thomas, D. N. 2008 p57"/>

On 3&nbsp;November, Thomas spent most of the day in his room, entertaining various friends.<ref>Thomas, D.N. (2008) p73</ref> He went out in the evening to keep two drink appointments. After returning to the hotel, he went out again for a drink at 2&nbsp;am. After drinking at the White Horse,  Thomas returned to the Hotel Chelsea, declaring, "I've had eighteen straight whiskies. I think that's the record!"<ref>Brinnin, J. (1955) p274.</ref> The barman and the owner of the pub who served him later commented that Thomas could not have drunk more than half that amount.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3609199/Generosity-was-repaid-with-mockery-and-insults.html |date= 28 December 2003|title= Generosity was repaid with mockery and insults |newspaper= Daily Telegraph|access-date= 15 July 2012|first1= Lewis|last1= Jones}}</ref>

Todd thought he sounded "terrible". The poet, [[Harvey Breit]], was another to phone that morning. He thought that Thomas sounded "bad". Thomas' voice, recalled Breit, was "low and hoarse". He had wanted to say: "You sound as though from the tomb", but instead he told Thomas that he sounded like [[Louis Armstrong]].<ref>Thomas, D.N. (2008) p77</ref>

Later, Thomas went drinking with Reitell at the White Horse and, feeling sick again, returned to the hotel.<ref>Ferris (1989), p. 336</ref> Feltenstein came to see him three times that day, administering the cortisone secretant [[ACTH]] by injection and, on his third visit, half a grain (32.4 milligrams) of [[morphine sulphate]], which affected Thomas' breathing. Reitell became increasingly concerned and telephoned Feltenstein for advice. He suggested she get male assistance, so she called upon the painter Jack Heliker, who arrived before 11&nbsp;pm.<ref name="Todd"/> At midnight on 5 November, Thomas's breathing became more difficult and his face turned blue.<ref name="Todd"/> Reitell phoned Feltenstein who arrived at the hotel at about 1&nbsp;am, and called for an ambulance.<ref>Ferris (1989), p. 338</ref><ref group="nb">Ruthven Todd states in his letter dated 23 November that the police were called, who then called the ambulance, while Ferris in his 1989 biography writes that Feltenstein was summoned again and called the ambulance.

Thomas was admitted to the emergency ward at [[St. Vincent's Hospital (Manhattan)|St Vincent's Hospital]] at 1:58&nbsp;am.<ref>Thomas, D.N.

Caitlin flew to America the following day and was taken to the hospital, by which time a [[tracheotomy]] had been performed. Her reported first words were, "Is the bloody man dead yet?"<ref Name="BBC"/> She was allowed to see Thomas only for 40 minutes in the morning<ref>Thomas, D. N. (2008), p. 97</ref> but returned in the afternoon and, in a drunken rage, threatened to kill John Brinnin. When she became uncontrollable, she was put in a [[straitjacket]] and committed, by Feltenstein, to the River Crest private psychiatric detox clinic on Long Island.

It is now believed that Thomas had been suffering from [[bronchitis]], [[pneumonia]] and [[emphysema]] before his admission to St Vincent's. In their 2004 paper, ''Death by Neglect'', D. N. Thomas and Dr Simon Barton disclose that Thomas was found to have pneumonia when he was admitted to hospital in a coma. Doctors took three hours to restore his breathing, using artificial respiration and oxygen. Summarising their findings, they conclude: "The medical notes indicate that, on admission, Dylan's bronchial disease was found to be very extensive, affecting upper, mid and lower lung fields, both left and right."<ref>Thomas, D.N. (2004) pp252-284</ref> The forensic pathologist, Professor [[Bernard Knight]], concurs: "death was clearly due to a severe lung infection with extensive advanced bronchopneumonia...the severity of the chest infection, with greyish consolidated areas of well-established pneumonia, suggests that it had started before admission to hospital."<ref>Thomas, D.N. (2008) p107.</ref>

Thomas died at noon on 9&nbsp;November, having never recovered from his coma.<ref Name="BBC"/><ref Name="History"/>

===Aftermath===

Rumours circulated of a [[brain haemorrhage]], followed by competing reports of a mugging or even that Thomas had drunk himself to death.<ref Name="BBC"/> Later, speculation arose about drugs and [[diabetes]]. At the [[post-mortem]], the pathologist found three causes of death&nbsp;– [[pneumonia]], [[brain swelling]] and a [[Fatty liver disease|fatty liver]]. Despite the poet's heavy drinking, his liver showed no sign of [[cirrhosis]].<ref Name="History">{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/nov/27/books.booksnews |title= History has Dylan Thomas dying from drink.

The publication of John Brinnin's 1955 biography ''Dylan Thomas in America'' cemented Thomas's legacy as the "doomed poet"; Brinnin focuses on Thomas's last few years and paints a picture of him as a drunk and a philanderer.<ref name="Poetry Foundation">{{cite web|url= http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/dylan-thomas |title= Dylan Thomas: 1914–1953|work= Poetry Foundation|access-date= 21 July 2012}}</ref> Later biographies have criticised Brinnin's view, especially his coverage of Thomas's death. David Thomas in ''Fatal Neglect: Who Killed Dylan Thomas?'' claims that Brinnin, along with Reitell and Feltenstein, were culpable.<ref name="Fatal Neglect"/> FitzGibbon's 1965 biography ignores Thomas's heavy drinking and skims over his death, giving just two pages in his detailed book to Thomas's demise. Ferris in his 1989 biography includes Thomas's heavy drinking, but is more critical of those around him in his final days and does not draw the conclusion that he drank himself to death. Many{{quantify|date=January 2019}} sources have criticised Feltenstein's role and actions, especially his incorrect diagnosis of [[delirium tremens]] and the high dose of morphine he administered.<ref>{{cite episode |title= Dylan Thomas: From Grave to Cradle |series= Arena |air-date= 16 May 2009 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0078mv0|network= BBC |season= 13 |credits= Williams, Nigel (presenter)}} originally BBC2 2003, most recent re-broadcast on BBC4 10 October 2021</ref> Dr C. G. de Gutierrez-Mahoney, the doctor who treated Thomas while at St. Vincents, concluded that Feltenstein's failure to see that Thomas was gravely ill and have him admitted to hospital sooner "was even more culpable than his use of morphine".<ref>Ferris (1989), p. 337</ref>

Caitlin Thomas's autobiographies, ''Caitlin Thomas&nbsp;– Leftover Life to Kill'' (1957) and ''My Life with Dylan Thomas: Double Drink Story'' (1997), describe the effects of alcohol on the poet and on their relationship. "Ours was not only a love story, it was a drink story, because without alcohol it would never had got on its rocking feet", she wrote,<ref>Thomas, C. (1997), p. 1</ref> and "The bar was our altar."<ref>Thomas, C.

Thomas's verbal style played against strict verse forms, such as in the [[villanelle]] "Do not go gentle into that good night". His [[imagery|image]]s appear carefully ordered in a patterned sequence, and his major [[theme (narrative)|theme]] was the unity of all [[life]], the continuing process of life and [[death]] and new life that linked the generations.{{qn|date=August 2020}} Thomas saw biology as a magical transformation producing unity out of diversity, and in his poetry sought a poetic ritual to celebrate this unity. He saw men and women locked in cycles of growth, love, [[procreation]], new growth, death, and new life. Therefore, each image engenders its opposite. Thomas derived his closely woven, sometimes self-contradictory images from the [[Bible]], [[Welsh mythology|Welsh folklore]], preaching, and [[Sigmund Freud]].<ref>{{cite book|editor1-first= M.

Thomas's early poetry was noted{{by whom|date=August 2020}} for its verbal density, [[alliteration]], [[sprung rhythm]] and [[internal rhyme]], and some critics detected the influence of the English poet [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]].<ref name="WAEoW"/> This{{clarify|date=August 2020}} is attributed{{by whom|date=August 2020}} to Hopkins, who taught himself Welsh and who used sprung verse, bringing some features of Welsh poetic [[Metre (poetry)|metre]] into his work.<ref name="Ferris(1989)115">Ferris (1889), p. 115</ref> When [[Henry Treece]] wrote to Thomas comparing his style to that of Hopkins, Thomas wrote back denying any such influence.<ref name="Ferris(1989)115"/> Thomas greatly admired [[Thomas Hardy]], who is regarded{{by whom|date=August 2020}} as an influence.<ref name="WAEoW"/><ref name="Ferris(1989)259">Ferris (1889), pp.&nbsp;259–260</ref> When Thomas travelled in America, he recited some of Hardy's work in his readings.<ref name="Ferris(1989)259"/>

Other poets from whom critics believe Thomas drew influence include [[James Joyce]], [[Arthur Rimbaud]] and [[D. H. Lawrence]]. [[William York Tindall]], in his 1962 study, ''A Reader's Guide to Dylan Thomas'', finds comparison between Thomas's and Joyce's wordplay, while he notes the themes of rebirth and nature are common to the works of Lawrence and Thomas.<ref>{{cite book|title= A Reader's Guide to Dylan Thomas|first1= William York |last1= Tindall |author-link = William York Tindall |year= 1962|publisher= Syracuse University Press|location= New York|page= 14 |access-date= 26 July 2012 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=EVIGMyDkaNQC&q=%22dylan+Thomas%22+%22+d+h+lawrence%22&pg=PA14|isbn= 978-0-8156-0401-3}}</ref><ref group="nb">In reply to a student's questions in 1951, Thomas stated: "I do not think that Joyce has had any hand at all in my writing; certainly his ''Ulysses'' has not. On the other hand, I cannot deny on the shaping of some of my ''Portrait'' stories might owe something to Joyce's stories in the volume, ''Dubliners''. But then ''Dubliners'' was a pioneering work in the world of the short story, and no good storywriter since can have failed, in some way, however little, to have benefited by it." FitzGibbon (1965), p. 370</ref> Although Thomas described himself as the "Rimbaud of Cwmdonkin Drive", he stated that the phrase "Swansea's Rimbaud" was coined by poet [[Roy Campbell (poet)|Roy Campbell]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/dylanthomas-kunitz-3524|title= Review of Dylan Thomas: His Life & Work by John Ackerman|first1= Daniel|last1= Kunitz|access-date= 20 July 2012|date= September 1996}}</ref><ref>Ferris (1989), p. 186</ref><ref group="nb">In his notes to page 186, Ferris (1989) states that in a [[BBC Home Service]] programme aired in 1950, ''Poetic Licence'', in which Campbell and Thomas appeared, Thomas said "I won't forgive you for the Swansea's Rimbaud, because you called me that first Roy".</ref> Critics have explored the origins of Thomas's mythological pasts in his works such as "The Orchards", which Ann Elizabeth Mayer believes reflects the Welsh myths of the ''Mabinogion''.<ref name="UMW Chron"/><ref>{{cite book|title= Artists in Dylan Thomas's Prose Works: Adam Naming and Aesop Fabling|first1= Ann Elizabeth|last1= Mayer |year= 1995|publisher= McGill-Queens |page= 31|access-date= 26 July 2012 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=N89BWqRT0IYC&q=%22dylan+Thomas%22+%22welsh+myth%22&pg=PA31|isbn= 978-0-7735-1306-8}}</ref><ref group="nb">"The Orchard" makes reference to the 'Black Book of Llareggub'.

Thomas once confided that the poems which had most influenced him were ''Mother Goose'' rhymes which his parents taught him when he was a child:
<blockquote>
I should say I wanted to write poetry in the beginning because I had fallen in love with words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for myself I had come to love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance&nbsp;... I fell in love, that is the only expression I can think of, at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that I had discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.<ref>{{cite book |title= Dictionary of Poetic Terms |year= 2003| last1= Myers |first1= Jack |last2= Wukasch|first2= Don |publisher= University of North Texas Press, U.S. | isbn= 978-1-57441-166-9}}</ref>
</blockquote>

Thomas became an accomplished writer of [[prose poetry]], with collections such as ''Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog'' (1940) and ''Quite Early One Morning'' (1954) showing he was capable of writing moving short stories.<ref name="WAEoW"/> His first published prose work, ''After the Fair'', appeared in ''The New English Weekly'' on 15 March 1934.<ref>{{cite book|title= Gurdjieff and Orage: Brothers in Elysium|last1= Taylor|first1= Paul Beekman|isbn= 978-1-57863-128-5|year= 2001|publisher= Weiser Books|page= 193}}</ref> Jacob Korg believes that one can classify Thomas's fiction work into two main bodies: vigorous fantasies in a poetic style and, after 1939, more straightforward narratives.<ref name="Korg Prose">
Korg (1965), pp.&nbsp;154–182.

Not for the proud man apart
From the raging moon, I write
On these spindrift pages
Nor for the towering dead
With their nightingales and psalms
But for the lovers, their arms
Round the griefs of the ages,
Who pay no praise or wages
Nor heed my craft or art.

Thomas disliked being regarded as a provincial poet and decried any notion of 'Welshness' in his poetry.<ref name="Ferris(1989)115"/> When he wrote to [[Stephen Spender]] in 1952, thanking him for a review of his ''Collected Poems'', he added "Oh, & I forgot. I'm not influenced by Welsh bardic poetry. I can't read Welsh."<ref name="Ferris(1989)115"/> Despite this his work was rooted in the geography of Wales. Thomas acknowledged that he returned to Wales when he had difficulty writing, and John Ackerman argues that "His inspiration and imagination were rooted in his Welsh background".<ref name="forum">{{cite journal|title=Cultural policy and place promotion: Swansea and Dylan Thomas|first1=Helen|last1=Watkins|first2=David|last2=Herbert |date=2003|journal=Geoforum |volume=34 |issue=2003 |page=254}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Welsh Dylan: An Exhibition to Mark the Twentieth Anniversary of the Poet's Death|first1=John|last1=Ackerman|year=1973|publisher=Welsh Arts Council|location=Cardiff|page=27}}</ref> Caitlin Thomas wrote that he worked "in a fanatically narrow groove, although there was nothing narrow about the depth and understanding of his feelings. The groove of direct hereditary descent in the land of his birth, which he never in thought, and hardly in body, moved out of."<ref>Ferris (1989), p.176</ref>

Head of Programmes Wales at the BBC, [[Aneirin Talfan Davies]], who commissioned several of Thomas's early radio talks, believed that the poet's "whole attitude is that of the medieval bards." [[Kenneth O. Morgan]] counter-argues that it is a 'difficult enterprise' to find traces of ''[[cynghanedd]]'' (consonant harmony) or ''[[cerdd dafod]]'' (tongue-craft) in Thomas's poetry.<ref name="Morgan">{{cite book |last1=Morgan |first1=Kenneth O. |title=A Rebirth of a Nation |year=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |pages=[https://archive.org/details/wales18801980reb0000morg/page/263 263–265] |isbn=978-0-19-821760-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/wales18801980reb0000morg/page/263 }}</ref> Instead he believes his work, especially his earlier more autobiographical poems, are rooted in a changing country which echoes the Welshness of the past and the [[Anglicisation]] of the new industrial nation: "rural and urban, chapel-going and profane, Welsh and English, Unforgiving and deeply compassionate."<ref name="Morgan"/> Fellow poet and critic [[Glyn Jones (Welsh writer)|Glyn Jones]] believed that any traces of ''cynghanedd'' in Thomas's work were accidental, although he felt Thomas consciously employed one element of Welsh metrics; that of counting syllables per line instead of [[Foot (prosody)|feet]].{{refn|Jones notes that in Thomas's early work, such as ''Eighteen Poems'', the [[Iamb (foot)|iambic foot]] was the rhythmic basis of his line, while in his later work a count of syllables replaced a count of [[Accent (poetry)|accents]].<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|1968|pp=179–180}}</ref>|group="nb"}} [[Constantine Fitzgibbon]],who was his first in-depth biographer, wrote "No major English poet has ever been as Welsh as Dylan".<ref>FitzGibbon (1965), p. 19</ref>

Although Thomas had a deep connection with Wales, he disliked [[Welsh nationalism]]. He once wrote, "[[Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau|Land of my fathers]], and my fathers can keep it".<ref name="FitzGibbon 10">FitzGibbon (1965), p. 10</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2003/oct/25/unitedkingdom.guardiansaturdaytravelsection |title=To begin at the beginning&nbsp;... |date=25 October 2003|access-date=27 July 2012|first1=Nick|last1=Wroe|work=guardian.co.uk}}</ref> While often attributed to Thomas himself, this line actually comes from the character Owen Morgan-Vaughan, in the screenplay Thomas wrote for the 1948 British melodrama ''[[The Three Weird Sisters]]''. Robert Pocock, a friend from the BBC, recalled "I only once heard Dylan express an opinion on Welsh Nationalism. He used three words. Two of them were Welsh Nationalism."<ref name="FitzGibbon 10"/> Although not expressed as strongly, Glyn Jones believed that he and Thomas's friendship cooled in the later years as he had not 'rejected enough' of the elements that Thomas disliked&nbsp;– "Welsh nationalism and a sort of hill farm morality".<ref>Jones (1968), p. 198</ref> Apologetically, in a letter to [[Keidrych Rhys]], editor of the literary magazine ''[[Wales (magazine)|Wales]]'', Thomas's father wrote that he was "afraid Dylan isn't much of a Welshman".<ref name="FitzGibbon 10"/> Though FitzGibbon asserts that Thomas's negativity towards Welsh nationalism was fostered by his father's hostility towards the Welsh language.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1966/feb/03/dylan-thomas/?pagination=false|title=Dylan Thomas, in response |first1=Constantine|last1=FitzGibbon|publisher=nybooks.com|date=3 February 1966|access-date=28 July 2012}}</ref>

==Critical reception==
Thomas's work and stature as a poet have been much debated by critics and biographers since his death. Critical studies have been clouded by Thomas's personality and mythology, especially his drunken persona and death in New York. When [[Seamus Heaney]] gave an [[Oxford]] lecture on the poet he opened by addressing the assembly, "Dylan Thomas is now as much a case history as a chapter in the history of poetry", querying how 'Thomas the Poet' is one of his forgotten attributes.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=40548687|title=Dylan the Durable? On Dylan Thomas|first1=Seamus|last1=Heaney|year=1993|pages=66–85|journal=[[Salmagundi (magazine)|Salmagundi]]|publisher=jstor.org|issue=100}}</ref> [[David Holbrook]], who has written three books about Thomas, stated in his 1962 publication ''Llareggub Revisited'', "the strangest feature of Dylan Thomas's notoriety—not that he is bogus, but that attitudes to poetry attached themselves to him which not only threaten the prestige, effectiveness and accessibility to English poetry, but also destroyed his true voice and, at last, him."<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U0harY5GMjUC&q=%22Dylan+Thomas%22+criticism+holbrook&pg=PA233|title=Powers of Being: David Holbrook and his Work|year=1995|editor-first=Edwin|editor-last=Webb|chapter="The Petals of the Man": The Relationship of David Holbrooks Criticism to his Poetry|first1=John|last1=Ferns|page=234|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press |access-date=28 July 2012|isbn=978-0-8386-3529-2}}</ref> The [[Poetry Archive]] notes that "Dylan Thomas's detractors accuse him of being drunk on language as well as whiskey, but whilst there's no doubt that the sound of language is central to his style, he was also a disciplined writer who re-drafted obsessively".<ref name="Poetry Archive">{{cite web | title= About Dylan Thomas |url= http://www.poetryarchive.org/poet/dylan-thomas| author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->| website= [[Poetry Archive]] | access-date= 8 March 2016 }}</ref>

Many critics have argued that Thomas's work is too narrow and that he suffers from verbal extravagance.<ref name="Wroe 2003">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/nov/15/poetry.highereducation|title=An insult to the brain|first1=Nicholas|last1=Wroe|work=guardian.co.uk|access-date=27 July 2012|date=15 November 2003}}</ref> Those that have championed his work have found the criticism baffling. [[Robert Lowell]] wrote in 1947, "Nothing could be more wrongheaded than the English disputes about Dylan Thomas's greatness&nbsp;... He is a dazzling obscure writer who can be enjoyed without understanding."<ref name="LRB 04-03-04">{{cite journal|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v26/n05/adam-phillips/a-terrible-thing-thank-god|title=A Terrible Thing, Thank God|first1=Adam|last1=Philips|journal=London Review of Books|publisher=lrb.co.uk|access-date=27 July 2012|date=4 March 2004|volume=26|issue=5}}</ref> [[Kenneth Rexroth]] said, on reading ''Eighteen Poems'', "The reeling excitement of a poetry-intoxicated schoolboy smote the Philistine as hard a blow with one small book as [[Algernon Charles Swinburne|Swinburne]] had with ''Poems and Ballads''."<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Dylan Marlais Thomas| encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of World Biography|year=2004 |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |access-date=31 July 2012|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Dylan_Thomas.aspx}}</ref> [[Philip Larkin]] in a letter to [[Kingsley Amis]] in 1948, wrote that "no one can 'stick words into us like pins'...&nbsp;like he [Thomas] can", but followed that by stating that he "doesn't use his words to any advantage".<ref name="LRB 04-03-04"/> Amis was far harsher, finding little of merit in his work, and claiming that he was 'frothing at the mouth with piss.'<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v22/n11/ian-hamilton/sorry-to-go-on-like-this |title=Sorry to go on like this |first1=Ian|last1=Hamilton|journal=London Review of Books |publisher=lrb.co.uk|access-date=27 July 2012|date=1 June 2000|volume=22 |issue=11 }}</ref> In 1956, the publication of the anthology ''New Lines'' featuring works by the British collective [[The Movement (literature)|The Movement]], which included Amis and Larkin amongst its number, set out a vision of modern poetry that was damning towards the poets of the 1940s. Thomas's work in particular was criticised. David Lodge, writing about The Movement in 1981 stated "Dylan Thomas was made to stand for everything they detest, verbal obscurity, metaphysical pretentiousness, and romantic rhapsodizing".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lodge|first1=David|title=Working with Structuralism|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul Books.|year=1981|isbn=978-0-7100-0658-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/workingwithstruc0000lodg/page/9 9]|format=PDF|url=https://archive.org/details/workingwithstruc0000lodg/page/9}}</ref>

Despite criticism by sections of academia, Thomas's work has been embraced by readers more so than many of his contemporaries, and is one of the few modern poets whose name is recognised by the general public.<ref name="Wroe 2003"/> In 2009, over 18,000 votes were cast in a BBC poll to find the UK's favourite poet; Thomas was placed 10th.<ref name="BBC Poetry Season 2009">{{cite web | title= The Nation's Favourite Poet Result – TS Eliot is your winner! |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/poetryseason/vote_results.shtml| author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date= 8 October 2009| website= [[BBC Online]] | access-date=  8 March 2016 }}</ref> Several of his poems have passed into the cultural mainstream, and his work has been used by authors, musicians and film and television writers.<ref name="Wroe 2003"/> The BBC Radio programme, ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'', in which guests usually choose their favourite songs, has heard 50 participants select a Dylan Thomas recording.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/find-a-castaway?q=Dylan+Thomas&type=music| title=Desert Island Discs: Dylan Thomas |access-date=14 December 2014|publisher=BBC}}</ref> John Goodby states that this popularity with the reading public allows Thomas's work to be classed as vulgar and common.<ref name="Goodby Preface">Goodby (2013), pp.&nbsp;6–8</ref> He also cites that despite a brief period during the 1960s when Thomas was considered a cultural icon, that the poet has been marginalized in critical circles due to his exuberance, in both life and work, and his refusal to know his place. Goodby believes that Thomas has been mainly snubbed since the 1970s and has become "...&nbsp;an embarrassment to twentieth-century poetry criticism",<ref name="Goodby Preface"/> his work failing to fit standard narratives and thus being ignored rather than studied.<ref>Goodby (2013), p.15</ref>
