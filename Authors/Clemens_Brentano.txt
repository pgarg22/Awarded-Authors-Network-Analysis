'''Clemens Wenzeslaus Brentano''' (also '''Klemens'''; pseudonym: '''Clemens Maria Brentano''' {{IPAc-en|b|r|ɛ|n|ˈ|t|ɑː|n|oʊ}}; {{IPA-de|bʁɛnˈtaːno|lang}}; 9 September 1778 – 28 July 1842) was a German [[poet]] and [[novelist]], and a major figure of [[German Romanticism]]. He was the uncle, via his brother [[Christian Brentano|Christian]], of [[Franz Brentano|Franz]] and [[Lujo Brentano]].

==Biography==
[[File:Brentano, Clemens – Die Gründung Prags, 1852 – BEIC 4178621.jpg|thumb|''Die Gründung Prags'' (1852)]]

Clemens Brentano was born to Peter Anton Brentano and Maximiliane von La Roche,<ref>John F. Fetzer, ''Clemens Brentano'', Twayne Publishers, 1981, p. 11.</ref> a wealthy merchant family in Frankfurt on 9 September 1778.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=8GS8DWMLRYEC&pg=PA109 Crawford, Heidi. "Clemens Bretano", ''Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era, 1760-1850'', Christopher John Murray (ed.), p. 109, Routledge, 2013] {{ISBN|9781135455798}}</ref> His father's family was of [[Italy|Italian]] descent. His sister was writer [[Bettina von Arnim]], who, at a young age, lionised and corresponded with [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], and, in 1835, published the correspondence as ''Goethes Briefwechsel mit einem Kinde'' (Goethe's correspondence with a child). Clemens Brentano studied in [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] and [[Jena]], afterwards residing at [[Heidelberg]], [[Vienna]] and [[Berlin]]. He was close to [[Christoph Martin Wieland|Wieland]], [[Johann Gottfried von Herder|Herder]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich von Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]], [[Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]] and [[Ludwig Tieck|Tieck]].<ref name=remy>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02759a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Klemens Maria Brentano|work=newadvent.org}}</ref> 

From 1798 to 1800 Brentano lived in Jena, the first center of the romantic movement. In 1801, he moved to [[Göttingen]], and became a friend of [[Achim von Arnim]]. He married writer [[Sophie Mereau]] on 29 October 1803. In 1804, he moved to [[Heidelberg]] and worked with Arnim on ''[[Zeitungen für Einsiedler]]'' and ''[[Des Knaben Wunderhorn]]''. After his wife Sophie died in 1806 he married a second time in 1807 to Auguste Bussmann (whose half-sister, Marie de Flavigny, later by marriage the Countess [[Marie d'Agoult]], would become the companion of pianist and composer [[Franz Liszt]]). In the years between 1808 and 1818, Brentano lived mostly in [[Berlin]],<ref name=remy/> and from 1819 to 1824 in [[Dülmen]], [[Westphalia]]. 

In 1818, weary of his somewhat restless and unsettled life, he returned to the practice of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] faith and withdrew to the monastery of Dülmen, where he lived for some years in strict seclusion. He took on there the position of secretary to the Catholic visionary nun, the [[beatification|Blessed]] [[Anne Catherine Emmerich]].<ref name=remy/>

It was claimed that from 1802 until her death she bore the wounds of the [[Crown of Thorns]], and from 1812 the full [[stigmata]], a cross over her heart and the wound from the lance. Clemens Brentano made her acquaintance in 1818 and remained at the foot of the stigmatist's bed copying her dictation until 1824. When she died, he prepared an index of the visions and revelations from her journal, ''The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ'' (published 1833). One of these visions made known by Brentano later resulted in the actual identification of the real [[House of the Virgin Mary]] in [[Ephesus]] by Abbé Julien Gouyet, a French priest, during 1881. However, some posthumous investigations in 1923 and 1928 made it uncertain how much of the books he attributed to Emmerich were actually his own creation and the works were discarded for her [[beatification]] process.<ref name=America>{{cite web|author=Father John O' Malley |title=A Movie, a Mystic, a Spiritual Tradition |website=[[America (Jesuit magazine)|America]] |date=15 March 2004 |url=http://americamagazine.org/content/article.cfm?article_id=3481&comments=1 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005193623/http://americamagazine.org/content/article.cfm?article_id=3481&comments=1 |archive-date=2011-10-05 }}</ref><ref name=Anvil >Emmerich, Anne Catherine, and Clemens Brentano.

The latter part of his life he spent in [[Regensburg]], [[Frankfurt]] and [[Munich]], actively engaged in promoting the Catholic faith. Brentano assisted Ludwig Achim von Arnim, his brother-in-law, in the collection of folk-songs forming ''[[Des Knaben Wunderhorn]]'' (1805–1808), which [[Gustav Mahler]] drew upon for his song cycle. In 1835, Swiss painter [[Emilie Linder]], painted the famous portrait of him.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Conzemius|first=Victor|date=November 27, 2008|title=Linder, Emilie|url=https://hls-dhs-dss.ch/articles/009911/2008-11-27/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-04-02|website=Historisches Lexikon der Schweiz|language=de}}</ref> He died in [[Aschaffenburg]].

Brentano, whose early writings were published under the pseudonym Maria, belonged to the Heidelberg group of German [[romanticism|romantic]] writers, and his works are marked by excess of fantastic imagery and by abrupt, bizarre modes of expression. His first published writings were ''[[Satiren und poetische Spiele]]'' (Leipzig, 1800), a romance ''Godwi oder Das steinerne Bild der Mutter'' (2 vols., Frankfort, 1801), and a musical drama ''Die lustigen Musikanten'' (Frankfort, 1803). Of his dramas the best are ''Ponce de Leon'' (1804), ''Victoria und ihre Geschwister'' (Berlin, 1817) and ''Die Grundung Prags'' (Pesth, 1815).

On the whole his finest work is the collection of ''Romanzen vom Rosenkranz'' (published posthumously in 1852); his short stories, and more especially the charming ''[[Geschichte vom braven Kasperl und dem schönen Annerl]]'' (1817), which has been translated into English, were very popular.

Brentano's collected works, edited by his brother Christian, appeared at Frankfurt in 9 vols. (1851–1855). Selections have been edited by J. B. Diel (1873), M. Koch (1892), and J. Dohmke (1893). See J. B. Diel and [[William Kreiten]], ''Klemens Brentano'' (2 vols, 1877–1878), the introduction to Koch's edition, and R. Steig, ''A. von Arnim und K. Brentano'' (1894). 

In his honor the [[Clemens-Brentano-Preis|Clemens Brentano prize]] is awarded for German literature.

==Musical settings and cultural references==
[[Richard Strauss]] set six poems by Brentano in [[Sechs Lieder, Op. 68 (Strauss)|''Sechs Lieder'', Op. 68]], in 1918, which are also known as his Brentano Lieder.

Brentano's work is referenced in [[Thomas Mann]]'s novel ''[[Doctor Faustus (Thomas Mann novel)|Doctor Faustus]]''. A cycle of thirteen songs, based on Brentano's poems, is noted in Chapter XXI as one of the composer protagonist's most significant early works.
