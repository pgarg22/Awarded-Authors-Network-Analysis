'''Vernon Phillips Watkins''' (27 June 1906 – 8 October 1967) was a [[Wales|Welsh]] poet, translator and painter.<ref name="W">[https://biography.wales/article/s2-WATK-PHI-1906 Welsh Biography Online] Retrieved : 27 February 2011</ref> He was a close friend of fellow poet [[Dylan Thomas]],<ref name="W"/> who described him as "the most profound and greatly accomplished Welshman writing poems in English".

==Early life and studies==
Vernon Watkins was born in [[Maesteg]] in [[Glamorgan]], and brought up mainly in [[Swansea]].<ref name="W"/> His birth coincided with slight earth tremors; another baby born that night was christened John Earthquake Jones. His parents were William Watkins, a manager for [[Lloyds Bank]] in Wind Street, Swansea, and Sarah ("Sally"), daughter of James Phillips and Esther Thomas of Sarnau, [[Meidrim]]. James Phillips was a [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]], reputed to know most of the [[Bible translations into Welsh|Welsh Bible]] by heart. Sarah had a love of poetry and literature; her headmistress arranged for her to spend two years as a pupil-teacher in Germany. William Watkins and Sarah Phillips married in 1902, and had three children, Vernon, Marjorie, and Dorothy. The family lived at "Redclliffe", a large [[Victorian era|Victorian]] house about {{convert|4|mi}} from Swansea, at [[Caswell Bay]].

Watkins read fluently by the age of four, and at five announced that he would be a poet, although he did not wish to be published until after his death. He wrote poetry and read widely from eight or nine years of age and was especially fond of the works of [[John Keats]] and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]].<ref name="E">Evans</ref> He received his later education at a preparatory school in Sussex, [[Repton School]] in Derbyshire, and [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]].

In his early years at Repton, Watkins' quiet, gentle character provoked regular [[bullying]] from older boys, though in his last years he attained more popularity as he was able to show capacity in tennis and cricket. After he died, in 1968, the school wrote that he was "perhaps the best poet Repton has had".<sup>[[Repton School|[7]]]</sup> His headmaster at Repton was [[Geoffrey Fisher]], who became [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].<ref name="W" /> Despite his parents being [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformists]], Watkins' school experiences influenced him to join the [[Church of England]]. He read modern languages at Cambridge, but left before completing his degree.

==Career==

===Dylan Thomas and the Swansea Group===
He met [[Dylan Thomas]], who was to be a close friend, in 1935 when Watkins had returned to a job in a bank in Swansea. About once a week Thomas would come to Vernon's parents' house, situated on the very top of the cliffs of the Gower peninsula. Vernon was the only person from whom Thomas took advice when writing poetry and he was invariably the first to read his finished work. They remained lifelong friends, despite Thomas's failure, in the capacity of [[groomsman|best man]], to turn up to the wedding of Vernon and Gwen in 1944. Thomas used to laugh affectionately at his friend's gossamer-like personality and extreme sensibility. A story is told that one evening in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], during the war time blackout, they were walking along and Vernon tripped over something and fell to the ground. Thomas looked with a torch to see what the offending object was and to his delight all that they could find was a small, black feather (FitzGibbon 1966). Vernon was godfather to Thomas's son Llewelyn, the others being [[Richard Cyril Hughes|Richard Hughes]] and [[Augustus John]]. ''Letters to Vernon Watkins'' by Thomas was published in 1957.<ref name="W"/> The 1983 book ''Portrait of a Friend'' by Watkins' wife Gwen, ''née'' Davies, deals with the relationship.

Others in the Swansea Group known as the "[[The Kardomah Gang|Kardomah boys]]" were the composer [[Daniel Jones (composer)|Daniel Jenkyn Jones]], writer [[Charles Fisher (poet)|Charles Fisher]] and the artists [[Alfred Janes]] and Mervyn Levy. Vernon wrote the obituary for Dylan Thomas and when he died, [[Philip Larkin]] wrote his obituary.

===Bletchley Park and marriage===
Watkins met Gwen, who came from Harborne, [[Birmingham]], at [[Bletchley Park]], where he worked during the [[Second World War]] as a [[cryptography|cryptographer]], and she, as a member of the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force|WAAF]]. They were both engaged in breaking the [[Luftwaffe]] AuKa tactical codes in Block F (A). Gwen was at first billeted at [[Stony Stratford]] but later moved to RAF Church Green at Bletchley.<ref name="W"/><ref>{{Cite book |title=The Bletchley girls: War, Secrecy, Love and Loss - the women of Bletchley Park tell their story |last=Dunlop |first=Tessa |date = 8 January 2015|author-link=Tessa Dunlop |isbn=9781444795738 |location=London|oclc=907942861}}</ref> They were both [[Flight Sergeant]]s and were stationed at Bletchley from June 1942 until May 1945.

They were married at the church of [[St Bartholomew-the-Great]], in London on 2 October 1944. The couple had five children.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

==Poetry==
His ambitions were for his poetry; in critical terms they were not to be fulfilled. On the other hand, he became a major figure for the Anglo-Welsh poetry tradition, and his poems were included in major anthologies. During the war he was for a time associated with the [[New Apocalyptics]] group. With his first book ''Ballad of the Mari Llwyd'' (1941) accepted by [[Faber and Faber]], he had a publisher with a policy of sticking by their authors. In his case this may be considered to have had an adverse long-term effect on his reputation, in that it is generally thought that he over-published.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} Of the book, the publisher said:
<blockquote>
"Mr Vernon Watkins is a Welsh poet whose work hitherto has appeared only in periodicals and in recent anthologies. The only influence apparent upon his poetry is one he has thoroughly assimilated - that of [[W. B. Yeats]]. Otherwise his style differs radically from that of any of his older contemporaries, except for a racial quality which gives it something in common with that of Dylan Thomas. Mr Watkins is undoubtedly a poet with an uncommon sense of rhythm as well as of imagery."<ref>Watkins, V. (1941). ''The Ballad of the Mari Lwyd and other poems'', London: [[Faber and Faber]] (rear dust jacket)</ref>
</blockquote>

The [[British Library]] holds a manuscript draft of the poem with annotations by [[T. S. Eliot]], showing Eliot at work as editor and board member at the publishing house Faber - his "day job" since 1925.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/manuscript-draft-of-the-ballad-of-the-mari-lwyd-by-vernon-watkins|title=Manuscript draft of 'The Ballad of the Mari Lwyd' by Vernon Watkins, with annotations by T S Eliot|website=The British Library|access-date=2 May 2018}}</ref> The Library also holds the Watkins Papers which include autograph and typewritten poems chiefly from his seven published volumes, but also some unpublished poems.<ref>[http://searcharchives.bl.uk/IAMS_VU2:IAMS032-001959612 Watkins Papers], archives and manuscripts catalogue, the British Library. Retrieved 22 June 2020</ref> In 2016, another collection of Watkins's draft poems was acquired from the widow of Watkins. <ref>[http://searcharchives.bl.uk/IAMS_VU2:IAMS032-003354650 Autograph and typescript drafts of poems by Vernon Watkins], archives and manuscripts catalogue, the British Library. Retrieved 22 June 2020</ref>

Watkins wrote poetry for several hours every night and by way of contrast, Caitlin, Dylan Thomas's wife, could not recall her husband staying in even for one night during their whole married life. As well as Yeats Vernon was familiar with [[T. S. Eliot]] and Philip Larkin. He was awarded a [[University of Wales]] honorary Doctorate of Literature in 1966 after retiring from his job at the bank. He was being considered for [[Poet Laureate]] at the time of his death.<ref name="W"/>

::That July morning when the poet's widow
::Stayed here, at breakfast looking through the window
::We saw young rabbits leap, and in a pother
::Frisk, dance and scurry, dodging one another,
::Returning always to the selfsame corner
::Between low beech-trees and the grassy border.
::They scattered when my children running out
::Found a young Redpoll injured on the ground.
::This sacrifice had made the rabbits dance.
::It had fallen from the fuchsia bush or branch
::Of beech that shook down dewdrops on my head.
::I for a moment thought the brilliant red
::Of breast and crest had come from a hawk's wound,
::But found no blood. The heart beat faintly. Soon
::We had laid it in a box, propped upon silk.
::I touched the twig-like leg. White bread and milk
::We gave it, but the beak at once refused,
::After one drop, to drink, and the eyes closed.
::It woke when my warm hand, encircling, took it,
::Straining to perch; but whether claw was crooked
::Or the wing hurt, it could not fly or stand.
::We left it where life's ember might be fanned
::By sunlight through a window. It revived
::A little. But the warmth on which it lived
::Diminished then, in the late afternoon.
::It was so small, so quiet in my room,
::That when I turned to lift it from the sill
::And feel its weight upon my fingers, still
::I counted to awaken it, nor saw
::What breath had chilled the feathers, gripped the claw;
::Nor did the dainty bird with that red stain
::Seem dead at all, until I looked again.
:::Watkins, ''The Redpoll'', a later poem, never fully revised.

==Death and memorial==

[[File:Vernon Watkins memorial at Pennard church - geograph.org.uk - 1308796.jpg|thumb|Memorial plaque at St Mary's Church, [[Pennard]], [[Glamorgan]]]]

Watkins had developed a serious heart condition, which he made light of, insisting on playing his beloved tennis and squash with his usual vigour. He died on 8 October 1967, aged 61, playing tennis in [[Seattle]], where he had gone to teach a course on modern poetry at the [[University of Washington]].<ref name="W"/>

His body was returned to Britain, and was buried in the Gower, at St Mary's Church, [[Pennard]]. A small granite memorial to him stands at Hunt's Bay, Gower, on which are inscribed two lines from his poem "Taliesin in Gower": "I have been taught the script of stones, and I know the tongue of the wave."

A portrait of Watkins by his friend [[Alfred Janes]] may be seen in the [[Glynn Vivian Art Gallery]], Swansea. A group portrait of the Kardomah Boys by Jeff Phillips was unveiled at Tapestri Arts Centre in Swansea in June 2011. Featured in the painting are Vernon Watkins, John Pritchard, Dylan Thomas, Daniel Jones and Alfred Janes. The picture is based on a [[BBC]] ''[[Radio Times]]'' front cover from October 1949.

In March 2012, in the [[BBC Radio 3]] programme ''Swansea's Other Poet'', [[Rowan Williams|Dr Rowan Williams]], Archbishop of Canterbury, presented a portrait of Watkins. Williams regards Watkins as "one of the 20th century's most brilliant and distinctive yet unjustly neglected voices".<ref>{{cite web|first=Laura |last=Chamberlain |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/wales/posts/vernon_watkins_swanseas_other_poet |title=Blogs – Wales – Vernon Watkins, Swansea's Other Poet |publisher=BBC |access-date=20 May 2014}}</ref>

In October 2014 [[City and County of Swansea Council|Swansea Council]] unveiled a [[blue plaque]] for Watkins outside the building on the corner of St Helen's Road and Beach Street in the city, where he spent 38 years working for Lloyds Bank.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/dylan-thomas-pal-codebreaker-poet-8018052|title=Dylan Thomas' pal the codebreaker poet Vernon Watkins is remembered in his hometown Swansea|first=Robin|last=Turner|date=29 October 2014|access-date=14 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-29814234|title=Plaque honours Swansea's second poet, Vernon Watkins|date=29 October 2014|access-date=14 July 2017|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swansea.gov.uk/article/10216/Poet-and-codebreaker-honoured-with-blue-plaque|title=Swansea - Poet and codebreaker honoured with blue plaque|website=www.swansea.gov.uk|access-date=14 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141125234100/http://www.swansea.gov.uk/article/10216/Poet-and-codebreaker-honoured-with-blue-plaque|archive-date=25 November 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> On 3 November 2014 the "Poem of the Week" in ''[[The Guardian]]'' was Watkins' "Three Harps".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/03/poem-of-the-week-three-harps-vernon-watkins|title=Poem of the week: Three Harps by Vernon Watkins|first=Carol|last=Rumens|date=3 November 2014|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=14 July 2017}}</ref>

Most of Watkins's manuscripts are held by the [[National Library of Wales]], Aberystwyth.

His grandson, [[Marley Watkins]], has played football for [[Norwich City F.C.]] and for [[Bristol City F.C.]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40041499|title=Ethan Ampadu: Exeter City youngster included in Wales squad|date=25 May 2017|access-date=14 July 2017|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}
