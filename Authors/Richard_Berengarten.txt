'''Richard Berengarten''' (born 1943) is a British poet, translator and editor. Having lived in Italy, Greece, the US and the former Yugoslavia, his perspectives as a poet combine English, French, Mediterranean, Jewish, Slavic, American and Oriental influences. His subjects deal with historical and political material, with inner worlds, relationships and everyday life. His work is marked by its multicultural frames of reference, depth of themes, and variety of form.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://literature.britishcouncil.org/writer/richard-berengarten|title=Richard Berengarten|website=British Council Literature|publisher=British Council|access-date=16 March 2016}}</ref> In the 1970s, he founded and ran the international [[Cambridge Poetry Festival]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.shearsman.com/browse-poetry-books-by-author-Richard-Berengarten|title=About the Author: Richard Berengarten|website=Shearsman Books|publisher=Shearsman Books, Ltd|access-date=16 March 2016}}</ref> He has been an important presence in contemporary poetry for the past 40 years, and his work has been translated into more than 90 languages.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=http://www.shearsman.com/ws-shop/category/826-berengarten-richard/product/5513-norman-jope-et-al---the-companion-to-richard-berengarten|title=Norman Jope et al – The Companion to Richard Berengarten|website=Shearsman Books|publisher=Shearsman Books|access-date=18 March 2016|quote=Berengarten has been a crucial presence in contemporary poetry for over forty years – not only as poet but also as translator, critic and driving force behind the legendary Cambridge Poetry Festival – and his poetry has been translated into more than ninety languages.}}</ref>

==Life and work==
Richard Berengarten (also known as '''Richard Burns''') was born in London in 1943 of Jewish immigrant parents.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPpNqvU4xiI</ref> He was educated at [[Mill Hill School]], and went on to study English at [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]] (1961–64)<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=http://www.interlitq.org/staff/richard_berengarten/bio.php|title=Richard Berengarten|website=International Literary Quarterly|access-date=18 March 2016}}</ref> and Linguistics at [[University College London]] (1977–78).<ref name=":5" />

He has lived in Italy, Greece, the UK, the US and the former Yugoslavia, and worked extensively in the Czech Republic, Latvia, Macedonia, Poland, Slovenia and Russia.<ref name=":5" />

Richard Berengarten published his first story (under the name of Richard Burns) at the age of 16 in ''Transatlantic Review''. As a student, he wrote for ''Granta'' and co-founded the Oxbridge magazine ''Carcanet''. He worked in Padua and Venice, briefly as apprentice to the English poet Peter Russell. In Greece, he witnessed the military coup d'état and in response wrote ''The Easter Rising 1967''. Returning to Cambridge, he met Octavio Paz and, with Anthony Rudolf, co-edited ''An Octave for Octavio Paz (1972)''. In the same year, his first poetry collection, ''Double Flute'' won an Eric Gregory Award.<ref name=":0" />

His posts include: the British Council, Athens (1967); East London College (1968–69); Cambridgeshire College of Arts and Technology (1969–79); Arts Council resident writer, Victoria Centre for Adult Education (1979–81); Visiting Professor, Notre Dame University (1982); and British Council Lector, Belgrade (1987–91). He is an authority on creative writing for children and adults, and on writing skills for university students. He was Royal Literary Fund Fellow at Newnham College, Cambridge (2003–2005), Project Fellow (2005–2006), and is currently a Preceptor at Corpus Christi College,<ref name=":6">{{Cite web|url=https://contrappassomag.wordpress.com/2015/08/20/from-issue-8-poetry-by-richard-berengarten-%E6%9D%8E%E9%81%93/|title=Poetry by Richard Berengarten|last=theodorell|date=20 August 2015|website=Contrappasso Magazine: International Writing|access-date=18 March 2016}}</ref> a Bye-Fellow at Downing College<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dow.cam.ac.uk/index.php/people/fellows/109-byefellows|title=Bye-Fellows|website=Downing College Cambridge|publisher=Downing College Cambridge|access-date=16 March 2016}}</ref> and an Academic Associate at Pembroke College, Cambridge. He also teaches at Peterhouse and Wolfson College, Cambridge, a Fellow of the English Association,<ref name=":0" /> and poetry editor of the Jewish Quarterly.<ref name=":6" />

Berengarten has translated poetry, fiction and criticism from Croatian, French, Greek, Italian, Macedonian and Serbian.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":5" />

His poems and poetry books have been translated into over 85 languages<ref name=":0" /> (the poem ''Volta'', presented in issue 9/2009 of ''The International Literary Quarterly'' (London) – ''Richard Burns, Volta: A Multilingual Anthology'' – into 75.<ref>[http://interlitq.org/issue9/volta/job.php Richard Burns, Volta: A Multilingual Anthology]</ref> ''Crna Svetlost'' (''Black Light'') was published in Yugoslavia in 1984, ''Arbol'' (''Tree'') in Spain in 1986, and bilingual editions of ''Tree/Baum'' (1989) and ''Black Light/Schwarzes Licht'' (1996), both translated by [[Theo Breuer]], were published in Germany.

In 2004, Berengarten's first book of selected writings ''For the Living'' includes the award-winning poems 'The Rose of Sharon' (Keats Memorial Prize) and 'In Memory of George Seferis I' (Duncan Lawrie Prize).<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.shearsman.com/ws-shop/category/826-berengarten-richard/product/4315-richard-berengarten-for-the-living|title=Richard Berengarten – For the Living|website=Shearsman Books|publisher=Shearsman Books|access-date=18 March 2016}}</ref>

Berengarten's 'Balkan Trilogy': ''The Blue Butterfly'' (2006), ''In A Time of Drought'' (2006); and ''Under Balkan Light'' (2008) has won international recognition, the first receiving the Wingate Prize,<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.shearsman.com/ws-shop/category/826-berengarten-richard/product/4318-richard-berengarten-the-blue-butterfly|title=Richard Berengarten – The Blue Butterfly|website=Shearsman Books|publisher=Shearsman Books|access-date=18 March 2016}}</ref> and the second receiving the Morava International Poetry Prize.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=http://www.shearsman.com/ws-shop/category/826-berengarten-richard/product/4317-richard-berengarten-in-a-time-of-drought|title=Richard Berengarten – In a Time of Drought|website=Shearsman Books|publisher=Shearsman Books|access-date=18 March 2016}}</ref> The Blue Butterfly takes as its starting point, a Nazi massacre on 21 October 1941 in Kragujevac in the former Yugoslavia. Richard Berengarten visited the site and the memorial museum in 1985, when a blue butterfly landed on the forefinger of his writing hand. The resulting work is powerful, examining themes of revenge and forgiveness from the historical context to the present time. He was made an honorary citizen of Kragujevac in 2012,<ref name=":5" /> and the title poem is well known in the former Yugoslavia through the translation by Danilo Kiš and Ivan V. Lalic.<ref name=":2" />

Richard Berengarten's perspectives as a poet combine British, French, Mediterranean, Jewish, Slavic, American and Oriental influences. On his own work Berengarten says: "I would rather think of myself as a European poet who writes in English than as an 'English' poet."<ref name=":1" /><ref>See: Richard Burns, ''The Blue Butterfly''</ref><blockquote>There is no civilisation without poetry. A poet’s responsibilities are social as well as subjective, communal as well as individual. Poetry, if it is not to caricature or betray itself, needs to involve critical commitment to both the past and future history of ‘all humanity’, and all nature.<ref name=":0" /> </blockquote>
