"I still use the writing techniques he discussed, and constantly reference him and his instruction when I teach creative writing myself. . . His explanations led me directly to getting an agent, and subsequently, my first book deal."—Brandon Sanderson

"When I reached the end of this first volume and sawgrace arise from a devastating battlefield where too many great hearts lay dead, Farland had earned the tears that came to my eyes. It was not sentiment but epiphany."—Orson Scott Card

"He understands storytelling and writing on a freaky level. All of us feel like we owe a huge debt to him."—James Dashner
