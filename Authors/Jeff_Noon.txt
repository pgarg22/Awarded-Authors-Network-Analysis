'''Jeff Noon''' (born 1957 in [[Droylsden]], [[Lancashire]], England) is a British novelist, [[short story|short story writer]] and playwright whose works make use of [[word play]] and [[fantasy]]. Noon's [[speculative fiction]] books have ties to the works of writers such as [[Lewis Carroll]] and [[Jorge Luis Borges]]. Prior to his relocation in 2000 to [[Brighton]], Noon set most of his stories in some version of his native city of [[Manchester]].

==Novels==
Noon's first four novels, which share ongoing characters and settings, are commonly referred to as the 'Vurt series' (after the first novel).
Although the fictional chronology leads from ''Automated Alice'' to ''[[Nymphomation]]'' to ''Vurt'' to ''Pollen'', the books were originally published as ''[[Vurt]]'' (1993), ''[[Pollen (novel)|Pollen]]'' (1995), ''Automated Alice'' (1996), and ''[[Nymphomation]]'' (1997). (''Automated Alice'' connects the series to the fictional world of [[Lewis Carroll]]), serving as a 'trequel' {{sic}} to Carroll's ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' and ''Through the Looking-Glass'' )

===''Vurt'' (1993)===
{{Main|Vurt}}

''Vurt'' tells the story of Scribble and his "gang" the Stash Riders as they search for his missing sister Desdemona. ''Vurt'' refers to a drug/shared alternate reality that is accessed by sucking on colour-coded feathers. Through some (never explained) mechanism, the dreams, mythology, and imaginings of humanity achieved objective reality in the ''Vurt'' and became "real". The book won the 1994 [[Arthur C. Clarke Award]]. There is a Vurt film in the works, but as of the date of this writing, Jeff Noon has stated on his public website that "... all has gone silent at the moment. Don’t hold your breath."{{Citation needed|reason=Quotation without citation|date=November 2016}}

===''Pollen'' (1995)===
{{Main|Pollen (novel)}}

''Pollen'' is the sequel to ''Vurt'' and concerns the ongoing struggle between the real world and the ''{{not a typo|vurt|ual}}'' world. When concerning the "{{not a typo|vurt|ual}}" world, some references to [[Greek mythology]] are noticeable, including [[Persephone]] and [[Demeter]], the river [[Styx (mythology)|Styx]] and [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]], and [[Hades]] (portrayed by the character John Barleycorn).

===''Automated Alice'' (1996)===
{{Main|Automated Alice}}

Noon describes ''Automated Alice'' as a "trequel" - it is a companion piece of sorts to Lewis Carroll's books ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''. The novella follows Alice's journey to a future Manchester populated by Newmonians, Civil Serpents and a vanishing cat named Quark.

The people who suffer from ''{{not a typo|new|monia}}'' (pronounced the same as the real condition [[pneumonia]]), are hybrids of humans and other entities. They are mainly hybrids of animals and humans, but also of other random items such as kitchen sinks and pianos.

The ''civil serpents'' (a play-on-words of the job 'civil servant') are trying to control everything that happens in the future, and try to stop randomness. The 'Supreme Serpent' is the controller of the serpents, and hints at the fact that he is [[Satan]] himself.
The writing style of Noon is very similar to that of [[Lewis Carroll]], who Noon constantly refers back to during the novel. The narrative is full of Alice mis-hearing words, most notably ''worm'' instead of ''wurm'', and ''pneumonia'' instead of ''{{not a typo|new|monia}}''.

There are also references to popular musical figures, with two notable characters. Firstly, James Marshall Hentrails, a sculpture made of rubbish, and who contains the insides (entrails) of a hen. This character is obviously a reference to [[Jimi Hendrix]]. The character also sings a song while playing the guitar. The song is titled 'Little Miss Bonkers', a reference to 'Little Miss Strange' by Hendrix.{{Original research inline|date=August 2010}}

Secondly, the character of Long Distance Davis, who Alice meets in a police cell, is a reference to jazz musician and trumpet player [[Miles Davis]].

===''Nymphomation'' (1997)===
{{Main|Nymphomation}}

''Nymphomation'' is the prequel to ''Vurt''. ''Nymphomation'' primarily tells the story of a lottery in Manchester involving dominos and a group attempting to crack the secrets of that lottery, but it also sets the background for much of the mythology found in the previous three books.

===''Pixel Juice'' (1998)===
Pixel Juice is a collection of fifty short stories.

===''Needle in the Groove'' (2000)===
{{Main|Needle in the Groove}}

''Needle in the Groove'' follows Elliot Hill, a bass player and ex-junkie trudging the pub-rock circuit, who is invited to join a new band: fusing DJ artistry, voice and rhythm section, the group's hypnotic groove creation is augmented by a startling new recording technology. The band seems bound for success - until one of them vanishes. Elliot's subsequent search draws him into a secret history of music that stretches back forty years and into his own past.
Jeff Noon and [[David Toop]] also released a CD, ''Needle in the Groove: if music were a drug, where would it take you'', on Sulphur Records in the same year.

===''Cobralingus'' (2001)===
''Cobralingus'' sits apart from Noon's other published works. It is part anthology of poems and part instructional textbook for Noon's style of poetry. In it, he details his regimented methods for the creation of poetic text by a style of word play which lends its name to the title. Also included are various exemplars of this style.

The Engine begins with Noon using an existing text and then applying different 'filter gates' that edit the text into something new. Examples of these gates include 'enhance' which creates elements of beauty in the text, and 'ghost edit'; this kills the text and calls up a ghost to haunt the text.

The ''Codex'' edition of the book was illustrated by [[Daniel Allington]] and has an introduction by [[Michael Bracewell (writer)|Michael Bracewell]], explaining the ''Cobralingus Engine''.

===''Falling out of Cars '' (2002)===
''Falling out of Cars'' is a road novel set in a near-future world where information-based civilization is falling apart. It follows the journey of Marlene, Henderson, and Peacock as they drive around England on a mission to gather fragments of a mirror that may be at the heart of the world's affliction. ''Falling out of Cars'' is the record Marlene keeps - or tries to keep - of her quest to flee from her past. Despite her daily dose of Lucidity, Marlene is gradually succumbing to the malady, and it gets harder and harder to distinguish dream from reality, hallucinations from events.

===''217 Babel Street'' (2008)===

''217 Babel Street'' was a collaborative project between four authors, [[Susanna Jones]], [[Alison MacLeod]], [[William Shaw (writer)|William Shaw]] and Noon. Only published online, this collection of short stories is set in a fictional British apartment building and features stories about the lives of each inhabitant, to which each author contributed. No longer available online.

===''Channel SK1N'' (2012)===

''Channel SK1N'' follows popstar Nola Blue on a journey of transformation as she begins to pick up signals on her skin. It was published as a [[Digital rights management|DRM]]-free ebook.
