'''George Payne Rainsford James''' (9 August 1799&nbsp;– 9 June 1860), was an English novelist and historical writer, the son of a physician in London. He was for many years British Consul at various places in the United States and on the Continent. He held the honorary office of British [[Historiographer Royal (England)|Historiographer Royal]] during the last years of [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV's]] reign.

==Early life==
George Payne Rainsford James was born in St George Street, [[Hanover Square, London]] in 1799. His father was a physician who had served in the navy and was in America during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], serving with [[Benedict Arnold]] in the [[Battle of Groton Heights]].<ref name="Joline">At the Library Table, Adrian Hoffman Joline, Richard Badger, Boston, 1910.</ref>

George attended the school of the Reverend William Carmalt in [[Putney]]. He developed a love of languages, including Greek, Latin, [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. He also studied medicine as a young man, but his inclinations led him in a different direction. He wanted to go into the navy, but his father was against it, due to his own naval experiences, finally allowing him to join the army. George served for a short time in the army as a lieutenant during the [[Hundred Days]], and was wounded in a small action following [[The Battle of Waterloo]]. He travelled extensively, visiting France and Spain soon after the abdication of [[Napoleon]]. These early travels gave him the idea for his novel ''Morley Ernstein''.<ref name="Joline"/>

==Career==

In 1825 he wrote his first, and probably his best known novel ''Richelieu: A Tale of France'', which was not published until 1829. After reading ''Richelieu'', which had been given to him by a friend, and after receiving a letter from James, [[Walter Scott]] advised him to take up literature as a profession. He was also given encouragement by [[Washington Irving]].<ref name="Joline"/>

In 1828 he married Frances Thomas, the daughter of [[Honoratus Leigh Thomas]], an important physician. After their marriage they lived in France, Italy, and Scotland. They had two children. His wife survived him by 31 years, dying in [[Wisconsin]] in 1891.<ref name="Joline"/>

He was appointed ''[[Historiographer Royal]]'' during the last years of William IV's reign, and published several official pamphlets. During this period he lived with his wife at Oxford Cottage in [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Marlow]]. 

In 1842 he lived at [[Walmer]] and was frequently a guest of the [[Duke of Wellington]] at [[Walmer Castle]]. In 1845 he went to Germany, partly for recreation and partly to gather material for his writings. On his return to England he lived for some time in [[Farnham, Surrey]].<ref name="Joline"/>

In July 1850 he left England and travelled to New York, where he rented [[Charles Astor Bristed]]'s house at [[Hell Gate]]. In 1851 he took a house at [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts]], where he later bought property and made some efforts at farming. In 1852 he was appointed British [[Consul (representative)|Consul]] at [[Norfolk, Virginia]]. In 1856 the Consulate was moved to [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]. His novels ''Ticonderoga'' and ''The Old Dominion'', written at this time, were set in the United States. In 1858 he was transferred to [[Venice]], Italy, partly due to failing health, where he was appointed Consul General. In April 1860, he became seriously ill. He died in June 1860 from a [[Apoplexy|stroke]]. He was buried in the cemetery at [[Isola di San Michele]]. The epitaph on his grave stone was written by his friend [[Walter Savage Landor]].<ref name="Joline"/> The epitaph reads:<blockquote>"George Payne Rainsford James.<br>British Consul General in the Adriatic.<br>Died in Venice on the 9th day of June, 1860.<br>His merits as a writer are known wherever the English language is, and as a man they rest on the hearts of many.<br>A few friends have erected this humble and perishable monument."</blockquote>

At an early age he began to write romances, and continued his production with such industry that his works reach to 100 volumes. For 30 years hardly a year went by that he failed to turn out at least one novel, and usually two or more, most of them "three-deckers" (three-volume). Describing himself as a follower of Sir Walter Scott, he may have produced more sheer verbiage than his mentor, chiefly historical fiction (61 titles in 158 volumes). This excessive production was fatal to his permanent reputation; but his books had considerable immediate popularity. Their titles are:
