==Early life==
Sackville was born on 24 January 1643,<ref>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/24442? Sackville, Charles, sixth earl of Dorset and first earl of Middlesex (1643–1706), poet and politician  by Harold Love.] ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]''. Retrieved 23 December 2016. {{subscription required}}</ref> son of [[Richard Sackville, 5th Earl of Dorset]] (1622–1677). His mother was the former [[Frances Sackville, Countess of Dorset|Lady Frances Cranfield]], sister and heiress of the [[Lionel Cranfield, 3rd Earl of Middlesex|3rd Earl of Middlesex]], to whose estates he succeeded in 1674, being created '''Baron Cranfield''', of Cranfield in the County of Middlesex, and '''Earl of Middlesex''' in 1675. He succeeded to his father's estates and title in August 1677. He was educated privately, and spent some time abroad with a private tutor, returning to England shortly before the [[English Restoration|Restoration]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=433}}

During King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]'s first Parliament, Sackville sat for [[East Grinstead (UK Parliament constituency)|East Grinstead]] in [[Sussex]]. He had no taste for politics, however, but won a reputation at [[Whitehall]] as a courtier and a wit.

He bore his share in the excesses for which Sir [[Charles Sedley]] and [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester|Lord Rochester]] were notorious. In 1662, Sackville and his brother Edward, with three other gentlemen, were indicted for the robbery and murder of a tanner named Hoppy. The defence was that they were in pursuit of thieves, and mistook Hoppy for a highwayman. They appear to have been acquitted, for when, in 1663, Sedley was tried for a gross breach of public decency in [[Covent Garden]], Sackville, who had been one of the offenders, was (according to [[Samuel Pepys]]) asked by the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]] "whether he had so soon forgot his deliverance at that time, and that it would have more become him to have been at his prayers begging God's forgiveness than now running into such courses again."{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=433}}<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=lSc0KQTD_eQC&pg=PA124&lpg=PA124&dq=%22calling+him+sirrah%22&source=bl&ots=3fvfNHW604&sig=0z4zAXehhD4o5MdVFLFvzhIXoMk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=scn-TtyuKYWg8gPwxJnMAQ&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22calling%20him%20sirrah%22&f=false Pepys' Diary, p124]</ref>

Something in his character made his follies less obnoxious to the citizens than those of the other [[Rake (character)|rake]]s, for he was never altogether unpopular, and Rochester is said to have told Charles II that "he did not know how it was, my Lord Dorset might do anything, yet was never to blame". In 1665 he volunteered to serve under the [[James II of England|Duke of York]] in the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]]. His famous song, "To All You Ladies Now at Land", was written, according to Prior, on the night before the victory gained over foggy [[Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam|Opdam]] off [[Harwich]] (3 June 1665). [[Samuel Johnson]], with the remark that seldom any splendid story is wholly true, said that the [[Earl of Orrery]] had told him it was only retouched on that occasion.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=433}}

In 1667, Pepys lamented that Sackville had lured [[Nell Gwyn]] away from the theatre, and that with Sedley the two kept merry house at [[Epsom]]. Next year the king was paying court to Gwyn, and her Charles the Second, as she called him ([[Charles Hart (17th-century actor)|Charles Hart]], a former lover, being her Charles the First), was sent on a "sleeveless errand" into France to be out of the way.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=433}} In 1678 he narrowly escaped death at the hands of the deranged [[Philip Herbert, 7th Earl of Pembroke|Earl of Pembroke]], with whom he was engaged in a lawsuit.<ref>Kenyon, J.P.

His gaiety and wit secured the continued favour of Charles II, but did not especially recommend him to [[James II of England|James II]], who could not, moreover, forgive Dorset's [[Parody|lampoon]]s on his mistress, [[Catherine Sedley, Countess of Dorchester]]. On James's accession, therefore, he retired from court. Sackville concurred in the invitation to [[William III of England|William of Orange]], who made him a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Counsellor]], [[Lord Chamberlain]] (1689), and [[Order of the Garter|Knight of the Garter]] (1692). During William's absences between 1695 and 1698, Sackville was one of the Lords Justices of the Realm.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=433–434}} In 1699 he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Persons&dsqPos=0&dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27sackville%27%29 |title=Library and Archive catalogue |publisher=Royal Society |accessdate=2012-02-28}}{{dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>

He was a generous patron of men of letters. When [[John Dryden]] was dismissed from the [[Poet laureate|laureate]]ship, he made him an equivalent pension from his own purse. [[Matthew Prior]], in dedicating his ''Poems on Several Occasions'' (1709) to Dorset's son, affirms that his opinion was consulted by [[Edmund Waller]]; that the [[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]] deferred the publication of his ''[[The Rehearsal (play)|Rehearsal]]'' until he was assured that Dorset would not rehearse upon him again; and that [[Samuel Butler (Hudibras)|Samuel Butler]] and [[William Wycherley]] both owed their first recognition to him. Prior's praise of Dorset is no doubt extravagant, but when his youthful follies were over he appears to have developed sterling qualities, and although the poems he has left are very few, none of them are devoid of merit. Dryden's ''Essay on Satire'' and the dedication of the ''[[Essay of Dramatick Poesie]]'' are addressed to him. [[Horace Walpole, 4th Earl of Orford|Walpole]] (''Catalogue of Noble Authors'', iv.) says that he had as much [[wit]] as his first master, or his contemporaries Buckingham and Rochester, without the royal want of feeling, the duke's want of principles or the earl's want of thought; and [[William Congreve (playwright)|Congreve]] reported of him when he was dying that he slabbered more wit than other people had in their best health.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=434}}

==Marriages==
[[File:Lionel and Mary Sackville.jpg|thumb|Charles Sackville had two children with his second wife, [[Mary Compton]]: [[Lionel Cranfield Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset|Lionel]] (right) and Mary (left)]]

Sackville was three times married; he married his first wife [[Mary, Countess of Falmouth|Mary Bagot]], widow of [[Charles Berkeley, 1st Earl of Falmouth|Charles Berkeley, Earl of Falmouth]] and daughter of Hervey Bagot and Dorothy Arden, in June 1674. He married his second wife, [[Mary Compton]], daughter of [[James Compton, 3rd Earl of Northampton]] and Hon. Mary Noel, on 7 March 1685; they had two children together, [[Lionel Cranfield Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset]] and Mary Sackville (1689–1705). He fathered two illegitimate daughters, one named Mary Sackville (died 26 June 1714), and the other with actress Alice Lee, named Anne Lee Sackville (1667–1738). He died at [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] in 1706.

==Works==
The fourth act of ''Pompey the Great'', a tragedy translated out of French by certain persons of honor, is by Dorset. The satires for which Pope classed him with the masters in that kind seem to have been short lampoons, with the exception of ''A faithful catalogue of our most eminent ninnies'' (reprinted in ''Bibliotheca Curiosa'', ed. Goldsmid, 1885). ''The Works of the Earls of Rochester, Roscommon and Dorset, the Dukes of Devonshire, Buckinghamshire, &c., with Memoirs of their Lives'' (1731) is catalogued (No. 20841) by [[H. G. Bohn]] in 1841. His poems are included in Anderson's and other collections of the British poets.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=434}}

==Portrayal in film==
Sackville is portrayed by [[Johnny Vegas]] as the invariable companion of fellow author and wit [[George Etherege]] ([[Tom Hollander]]) in the 2004 film ''[[The Libertine (2004 film)|The Libertine]]'', an adaptation of [[Stephen Jeffreys]]' play of the same name, which depicts the [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester|Earl of Rochester]] and the orbit of the "[[Merry Gang]]".
