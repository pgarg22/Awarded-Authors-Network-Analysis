==Career==
After graduating from [[Columbia University]] with B.A. and M.A. degrees in 1970, he moved to Paris, France, where he earned a living translating French literature. Since returning to the United States in 1974, he has published poems, essays, and novels, as well as translations of French writers such as [[Stéphane Mallarmé]] and [[Joseph Joubert]].

[[File:Paul Auster, Salman Rushdie and Shimon Peres.jpg|thumb|Auster greeting Israeli President [[Shimon Peres]] with [[Salman Rushdie]] and [[Caro Llewellyn]] in 2008]]
Following his acclaimed debut work, a memoir titled ''[[The Invention of Solitude]]'', Auster gained renown for a series of three loosely connected stories published collectively as ''[[The New York Trilogy]]''. Although these books allude to the detective genre they are not conventional detective stories organized around a mystery and a series of clues. Rather, he uses the detective form to address [[existentialism|existential]] questions of identity, space, language, and literature creating his own distinctively [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] (and critique of postmodernist) form in the process. According to Auster, "...the ''Trilogy'' grows directly out of ''The Invention of Solitude''."<ref>Mallia, Joseph. "[http://bombsite.com/issues/23/articles/1062 "Paul Auster"], "[[BOMB Magazine]]", Spring, 1988.</ref>

The search for identity and personal meaning has permeated Auster's later publications, many of which concentrate heavily on the role of coincidence and random events (''[[The Music of Chance]]'') or increasingly, the relationships between people and their peers and environment (''[[The Book of Illusions]]'', ''[[Moon Palace]]''). Auster's heroes often find themselves obliged to work as part of someone else's inscrutable and larger-than-life schemes. In 1995, Auster wrote and co-directed the films ''[[Smoke (film)|Smoke]]'' (which won him the [[Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay]]) and ''[[Blue in the Face]]''. Auster's more recent works, from ''[[Oracle Night]]'' (2003) to ''4 3 2 1'' (2017), have also met with critical acclaim.

He was on the [[PEN American Center]] Board of Trustees from 2004 to 2009,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Board of Trustees: 2004–2005 {{!}} PEN American Center|url = http://www.pen.org/board-trustees-2004-2005|website = www.pen.org|date = August 28, 2012|access-date = 15 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Board of Trustees: 2008–2009 {{!}} PEN American Center|url = http://www.pen.org/board-trustees-2008-2009|website = www.pen.org|date = August 28, 2012|access-date = 15 January 2016}}</ref> and Vice President during 2005 to 2007.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Board of Trustees: 2005–2006 {{!}} PEN American Center|url = http://www.pen.org/board-trustees-2005-2006|website = www.pen.org|date = August 28, 2012|access-date = 15 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Board of Trustees: 2006–2007 {{!}} PEN American Center|url = http://www.pen.org/board-trustees-2006-2007|website = www.pen.org|date = August 28, 2012|access-date = 15 January 2016}}</ref>

In 2012, Auster said in an interview that he would not visit [[Turkey]], in protest of its treatment of journalists. The Turkish Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] replied: "As if we need you! Who cares if you come or not?"<ref>{{cite web|author=Associated Press in Ankara |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/01/turkish-pm-paul-auster-human-rights |title=Turkish PM criticizes US writer Paul Auster over human rights comments, Guardian, 01.02.2012 |work=The Guardian |date=March 27, 2013 |access-date=20 April 2013}}</ref> Auster responded: "According to the latest numbers gathered by International PEN, there are nearly one hundred writers imprisoned in Turkey, not to speak of independent publishers such as [[Ragıp Zarakolu]], whose case is being closely watched by PEN Centers around the world".<ref>{{cite web|last=Itzkoff |first=Dave |url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/01/paul-auster-responds-after-turkish-prime-minister-calls-him-an-ignorant-man/ |title=Paul Auster Responds After Turkish Prime Minister Calls Him 'an Ignorant Man', The New York Times, 01.02.2012 |date=February 2012 |location=Turkey |publisher=Artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com |access-date=20 April 2013}}</ref>

Auster's most recent book, ''A Life in Words,'' was published in October 2017 by [[Seven Stories Press]]. It brings together three years of conversations with the Danish scholar I.B. Siegumfeldt about each one of his works, both fiction and non-fiction. It is a primary source for understanding Auster's approach to his work.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/539868/a-life-in-words-by-paul-auster-in-conversation-with-i-b-siegumfeldt/9781609807771/ |title=A Life in Words by Paul Auster in Conversation with I B Siegumfeldt |publisher=Penguin Random House |access-date=5 June 2017}}</ref>

===Themes===
Much of the early scholarship about Auster's work saw links between it and the theories of such French writers as [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Jacques Derrida]], and others. Auster himself has denied these influences and has asserted in print that "I've read only one short essay by Lacan, the 'Purloined Letter,' in the ''Yale French Studies'' issue on poststructuralism—all the way back in 1966."<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Life in Words|last=Auster|first=Paul|publisher=Seven Stories Press|year=2017|pages=xv}}</ref>  Other scholars have seen influences in Auster's work of the American transcendentalists of the nineteenth century, as exemplified by [[Henry David Thoreau]] and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]. The transcendentalists believed that the symbolic order of civilization has separated us from the natural order of the world, and that by moving into nature, as Thoreau did, as he described in ''[[Walden]]'', it would be possible to return to this natural order.

[[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Samuel Beckett]], and [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] have also had a strong influence on Auster's writing. Auster has specifically referred to characters from Poe and Hawthorne in his novels, for example [[William Wilson (short story)|William Wilson]] in ''City of Glass'' or Hawthorne's [[Fanshawe (novel)|Fanshawe]] in ''The Locked Room'', both from ''[[The New York Trilogy]]''.

==Reception==
"Over the past twenty-five years," opined [[Michael Dirda]] in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' in 2008, "Paul Auster has established one of the most distinctive niches in contemporary literature."<ref>{{Cite magazine |title=Spellbound |last=Dirda |first=Michael |magazine=The New York Review of Books |date=4 December 2008 |access-date=12 November 2019 |url= https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2008/12/04/spellbound/ }}</ref> Dirda also has extolled his loaded virtues in ''[[The Washington Post]]'':

<blockquote>Ever since ''City of Glass'', the first volume of his ''New York Trilogy'', Auster has perfected a limpid, confessional style, then used it to set disoriented heroes in a seemingly familiar world gradually suffused with mounting uneasiness, vague menace and possible hallucination. His plots – drawing on elements from suspense stories, existential récit, and autobiography – keep readers turning the pages, but sometimes end by leaving them uncertain about what they've just been through.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Strange things begin to happen when a writer buys a new notebook|last=Dirda |first=Michael |work=The Washington Post |date=21 December 2003 |access-date=12 November 2019 |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/entertainment/books/2003/12/21/strange-things-begin-to-happen-when-a-writer-buys-a-new-notebook/00362b46-362a-499c-a1df-7b9db455846c/ }}</ref></blockquote>

Writing about Auster's most recent novel, ''4 3 2 1'', ''Booklist'' critic Donna Seaman remarked:<blockquote>Auster has been turning readers' heads for three decades, bending the conventions of storytelling, blurring the line between fiction and autobiography, infusing novels with literary and cinematic allusions, and calling attention to the art of storytelling itself, not with cool, intellectual remove, but rather with wonder, gratitude, daring, and sly humor. ... Auster's fiction is rife with cosmic riddles and rich in emotional complexity.  He now presents his most capacious, demanding, eventful, suspenseful, erotic, structurally audacious, funny, and soulful novel to date. ... Auster is conducting a grand experiment, not only in storytelling, but also in the endless nature-versus-nurture debate, the perpetual dance between inheritance and free will, intention and chance, dreams and fate.  This elaborate investigation into the big what-if is also a mesmerizing dramatization of the multitude of clashing selves we each harbor within. ... A paean to youth, desire, books, creativity, and unpredictability, it is a four-faceted bildungsroman and an ars poetica, in which Auster elucidates his devotion to literature and art.  He writes, 'To combine the strange with the familiar: that was what Ferguson aspired to, to observe the world as closely as the most dedicated realist and yet to create a way of seeing the world through a different, slightly distorting lens.' Auster achieves this and much more in his virtuoso, magnanimous, and ravishing opus.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.booklistonline.com/4-3-2-1-Auster-Paul/pid=8436919?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1|title=Booklist review: 4 3 2 1 by Paul Auster|last=Seaman|first=Donna|date=November 15, 2016|website=Booklist}}</ref></blockquote>

The English critic [[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]], however, offered Auster little praise:

<blockquote>Clichés, borrowed language, bourgeois bêtises are intricately bound up with modern and postmodern literature. For Flaubert, the cliché and the received idea are beasts to be toyed with and then slain. "Madame Bovary" actually italicizes examples of foolish or sentimental phrasing. Charles Bovary's conversation is likened to a pavement, over which many people have walked; twentieth-century literature, violently conscious of mass culture, extends this idea of the self as a kind of borrowed tissue, full of other people's germs. Among modern and postmodern writers, Beckett, Nabokov, Richard Yates, Thomas Bernhard, Muriel Spark, Don DeLillo, Martin Amis, and David Foster Wallace have all employed and impaled cliché in their work. Paul Auster is probably America's best-known postmodern novelist; his "New York Trilogy" must have been read by thousands who do not usually read avant-garde fiction. Auster clearly shares this engagement with mediation and borrowedness—hence, his cinematic plots and rather bogus dialogue—and yet he does nothing with cliché except use it.  This is bewildering, on its face, but then Auster is a peculiar kind of postmodernist. Or is he a postmodernist at all? Eighty per cent of a typical Auster novel proceeds in a manner indistinguishable from American realism; the remaining twenty per cent does a kind of postmodern surgery on the eighty per cent, often casting doubt on the veracity of the plot. Nashe, in "The Music of Chance" (1990), sounds as if he had sprung from a Raymond Carver story (although Carver would have written more interesting prose) ... One reads Auster's novels very fast, because they are lucidly written, because the grammar of the prose is the grammar of the most familiar realism (the kind that is, in fact, comfortingly artificial), and because the plots, full of sneaky turns and surprises and violent irruptions, have what the Times once called "all the suspense and pace of a bestselling thriller." There are no semantic obstacles, lexical difficulties, or syntactical challenges. The books fairly hum along. The reason Auster is not a realist writer, of course, is that his larger narrative games are anti-realist or surrealist.</blockquote>

Wood also bemoaned Auster's 'b-movie dialogue', 'absurdity', 'shallow skepticism', 'fake realism' and 'balsa-wood backstories'.

==Personal life==
Auster was married to the writer [[Lydia Davis]].

Auster and his second wife, writer [[Siri Hustvedt]] (the daughter of professor and scholar [[Lloyd Hustvedt]]), were married in 1981, and they live in [[Brooklyn]].<ref name=JPost/> Together they have one daughter, [[Sophie Auster]].<ref>Denes, Melissa (February 3, 2006).

In 2009, Auster signed a petition in support of film director [[Roman Polanski]], calling for his release after Polanski was arrested in Switzerland in relation to his [[Roman Polanski sexual abuse case|1977 charge]] for drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://laregledujeu.org/2009/11/10/479/signez-la-petition-pour-roman-polanski/ |title=Signez la pétition pour Roman Polanski ! |date=November 10, 2009 |website=La Règle du jeu |language=fr |access-date=August 29, 2021 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/AytVq |archive-date=August 29, 2021}}</ref>

* Austrian composer [[Olga Neuwirth]]'s composition '' ... ce qui arrive ... '' (2004) combines the recorded voice of Paul Auster with ensemble music and live electronics by Markus Noisternig and Thomas Musil (Institute of Electronic Music and Acoustics (IEM)). Paul Auster is heard reading from his books ''Hand to Mouth'' and ''The Red Notebook'', either as straight recitation, integrated with other sounds as if in a radio play, or passed through an electronically realized string resonator so that the low tones interact with those of a string ensemble. A film by Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster runs throughout the work featuring the cabaret artist and actress Georgette Dee.
* In 2005 his daughter, [[Sophie Auster|Sophie]], recorded an album of songs in both French and English, entitled ''Sophie Auster'', with the band [[One Ring Zero]]. The lyrics of three of the songs (in English) are by Paul Auster; and he also provided for the accompanying booklet translations of several French poems which form the lyrics of other songs on the album.
* Paul Auster's voice may be heard on the 2005 album entitled ''We Must Be Losing It'' by [[The Farangs]]. The two tracks are entitled "Obituary in the Present Tense" and "Between the Lines".
* On the 2006 album ''[[As Smart as We Are]]'' by New York band [[One Ring Zero]], Auster wrote the lyrics for the song "Natty Man Blues" based on Cincinnati poet [[Norman Finkelstein (poet)|Norman Finkelstein]].
* In 2006 Paul Auster directed the film ''[[The Inner Life of Martin Frost]]'', based on an original screenplay by him. It was shot in [[Lisbon]] and [[Azenhas do Mar]] and starred [[David Thewlis]], [[Iréne Jacob]], and [[Michael Imperioli]] as well as Auster's daughter Sophie. Auster provided the narration, albeit [[Closing credits|uncredited]]. The film premiered at the [[European Film Market]], as part of the 2007 [[Berlinale]] in Berlin, Germany on February 10, 2007, and opened in New York City on September 7 of the same year.
* The lyrics of [[Fionn Regan]]'s 2006 song ''Put A Penny in the Slot'' mention Auster and his novella ''[[Timbuktu (novella)|Timbuktu]]''.
* In the 2008 Russian film ''Плюс один'' (Plus One), the main character is in the process of translating one of Auster's books.
* In the 2008 novel ''[[To the End of the Land]]'' by [[David Grossman]], the bedroom bookshelf of the central IDF soldier character Ofer is described as prominently displaying several Auster titles.
* In the 2009 documentary ''[[Act of God (film)|Act of God]]'', Auster is interviewed on his experience of watching another boy struck and killed by lightning when he was 14.
* In the 2011 documentary on [[Charlotte Rampling]] ''The Look'', Auster meditates on beauty with Charlotte Rampling on his moored tug boat on the Hudson river.
*Pedro Almodovar's 2019 movie, "Pain and Glory" ("Dolor y Gloria"), is in many ways an homage to the works of Paul Auster.  While Salvador is in his heroin induced stupor, Alberto logs on to his computer.  As the camera pans across the desktop screen, we see an icon entitled "Paul Auster."  The narrative structure and arc of the film, with its many coincidences (Federico stumbling on to the performance of the play; the discovery, many years later, of Eduardo's painting), are a visual depiction of an Auster novel.
