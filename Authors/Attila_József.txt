Attila József was born in [[Ferencváros]], a poor district of [[Budapest]], in 1905 to Áron József, a soap factory worker of [[Székelys|Székely]] and Romanian origin from [[Banat]], and Borbála Pőcze, a Hungarian peasant girl with [[Cumans|Cuman]] ancestry;<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2gBjAAAAMAAJ&q=Cuman|title=Attila József: "Can you take on this awesome life?"|last1=Kabdebó|first1=Thomas|last2=Kabdebó|first2=Tamás|date=18 May 1997|publisher=Argumentum|isbn=9781897922026|via=Google Books}}</ref> he had two elder sisters, Eta and Jolán. When József was three years old, he was sent to live with foster parents after his father abandoned the family and his mother became ill. At the time of his birth, Attila was not a well known name; because of this, his foster parents called him Pista, a nickname for the Hungarian version of Stephen.<ref name=Garai>{{cite book|last=Garai|first=Laszlo|title=Reconsidering Identity Economics: Human Well-Being and Governance|date=2017|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|isbn=978-1-137-52560-4|page=8}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://poets.org/poet/attila-jozsef|title=About Attila József {{!}} Academy of American Poets|last=Poets|first=Academy of American|website=poets.org|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref><ref name=":1" />

From ages seven to fourteen, József returned to living with his mother until she died of cancer in 1919, aged only 43.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> While also attending school, he worked many odd jobs and was a self-described [[Street children|street urchin]]. After the death of his mother, the teenage József was looked after by his brother-in-law, Ödön Makai, who was relatively wealthy and could pay for his education in a good secondary school.<ref name=":1" />

In 1924, József entered [[Franz Joseph University]] to study [[Hungarian literature|Hungarian]] and [[French literature]], with the intention of becoming a secondary school teacher. He was expelled from the university, deemed unfit to be a teacher, after he wrote the provocative and revolutionary poem, ''Tiszta szívvel'' ("With clear heart" or "With all my heart"). With his manuscripts, he traveled to [[Vienna]] in 1925 where he made a living by selling newspapers and cleaning dormitories, and then to Paris for the following two years, where he studied at the [[Sorbonne]]. During this period he read [[Hegel]] and [[Karl Marx]], whose call for revolution appealed to him as well as the work of [[François Villon]], the famous poet and thief from the 15th-century. Financially, József was supported by the little money he earned by publishing his poems as well as by his patron, Lajos Hatvany. He returned to Hungary and studied at Pest University for a year. József then worked for the Foreign Trade Institute as a French correspondent and, later, was the editor of the literary journal ''Szép Szó'' (''Beautiful Word''.)<ref name=":1" />

A supporter of the working class, József joined the illegal [[Hungarian Communist Party|Communist Party of Hungary]] (KMP) in 1930.<ref name=":0" /> His 1931 work ''Döntsd a tőkét'' (''Blow down the block/capital'') was confiscated by the public prosecutor. József's later essay "Literature and Socialism" (''Irodalom és szocializmus'') led to indictment. In 1936, he was expelled from the Hungarian Communist Party due to his independence and interest in [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]].<ref name=":1" />

Beginning in childhood, József began showing signs of mental illness and was treated by psychiatrists for depression and [[schizophrenia]]. In adulthood, he was sent by the state to a [[sanatorium]] and was diagnosed with "[[Neurasthenia|neurasthenia gravis]]."<ref name=":1" />  Modern scholars believe that he likely had [[borderline personality disorder]].<ref name="Meszaros">{{cite book|last=Meszaros|first=Judit|title=Ferenczi and Beyond|date=2014|publisher=Karnac Books|isbn=978-1-78220-000-0|page=80}}</ref> He never married and only had a small number of affairs, but frequently fell in love with the women who were treating him.{{fact|date=May 2021}}

József died on 3 December 1937, aged 32, in [[Balatonszárszó]]. At the time, he was staying at the house of his sister and brother-in-law. He was killed while crawling through railway tracks where he was crushed by a starting train. There is a memorial to him not far from the location where he died. The most widely accepted view is that he committed suicide, which he had previously attempted, but some experts say that his death was by accident.<ref>{{cite web

József published his first volume of poetry ''A szépség koldusa'' (''Beauty's beggar'') in 1922; at the time of publishing, he was seventeen and still in school.

In 1925, József published his second collection of poems, ''Nem én kiáltok'' (''It's not me who shouts''). József's works were praised by such internationally known Hungarian researchers and critics as [[Béla Balázs]] and [[György Lukács]]. In 1927, several French magazines published József's poems.

József's third collection of poems, ''Nincsen apám se anyám'' (1929) (''I have neither father nor mother''), showed the influence of French [[surrealism]] and Hungarian poets [[Endre Ady]], [[Gyula Juhász (poet)|Gyula Juhász]] and [[Lajos Kassák]].

In the 1930s, József turned his focus from a search for beauty to the plight of the working class and reflected his interest in Communism.<ref name=":0" /> In 1932, ''Külvárosi éj'' (''Night in the outskirts''), a mature collection of poems, was published. His most famous love poem, ''Óda'' ("Ode"), from 1933, took the reader for a journey around and inside the body of the beloved woman.

József's last two books were ''Medvetánc'' (''Bear dance'') and ''Nagyon fáj'' (''It hurts very much''), published in 1934 and 1936 respectively. With these works he gained wide critical attention. Ideologically, he had started to advocate humane socialism and alliance with all democratic forces. It was Attila József who first formulated the ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|ars poetica]]'' of [[Poetic transrealism|transrealism]] in his 1937 poem ''Welcome to Thomas Mann''.<ref>{{cite web
