==Biography==
Keith Waterhouse was born in [[Hunslet]], [[County Borough of Leeds|Leeds]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], England. He performed two years of [[national service]] in the [[Royal Air Force]].

His credits, many with lifelong friend and collaborator [[Willis Hall]], include [[satire]]s such as ''[[That Was The Week That Was]]'', ''[[BBC-3 (TV series)|BBC-3]]'' and ''[[The Frost Report]]'' during the 1960s; the book for the 1975 musical ''[[The Card (musical)|The Card]]'';  ''[[Budgie (TV series)|Budgie]]''; ''[[Worzel Gummidge (TV series)|Worzel Gummidge]]''; and ''[[Andy Capp (TV series)|Andy Capp]]'' (an adaptation of the [[comic strip]]).

His 1959 book ''[[Billy Liar]]'' was subsequently filmed by [[John Schlesinger]] with [[Tom Courtenay]] as Billy. It was nominated in six categories of the 1964 [[BAFTA]] awards, including Best Screenplay, and was nominated for the Golden Lion at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in 1963; in the early 1970s the sitcom ''[[Billy Liar (TV series)|Billy Liar]]'' based on the character was quite popular and ran to 25 episodes.

Waterhouse's first screenplay was the film ''[[Whistle Down the Wind (film)|Whistle Down the Wind]]'' (1961). Without receiving screen credit, Waterhouse and Hall extensively rewrote the original script for [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Torn Curtain]]'' (1966). Waterhouse wrote the comic play, ''[[Jeffrey Bernard is Unwell]]'' (1989; [[Old Vic]] premiere, 1999), based on the louche life of London journalist [[Jeffrey Bernard]].

His career began at the ''[[Yorkshire Evening Post]]'' and he also wrote regularly for ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', and latterly for the ''[[Daily Mail]]''. He initially joined the ''Mirror'' as a reporter in 1952, before he became a playwright and novelist; during his initial stint, he campaigned against the colour bar in post-war Britain,<ref>"Black, blind hate", ''Daily Mirror'', 15 March 1954, page 7, and "The shame of a Jim Crow city", ''Daily Mirror'', 16 March 1954, also page 7</ref> the abuses committed in the name of the [[British Empire]] in [[Kenya]]<ref>"The newspaper with a blind eye", ''Daily Mirror'', 7 September 1955, page 2</ref> and the British government's selling of weapons to various [[Middle East]]ern countries.<ref>"A very, very nasty smell indeed", ''Daily Mirror'', 31 December 1955, page 1</ref>  Subsequently, he returned as a columnist, initially in the ''Mirror Magazine'', moving to the main newspaper on 22 June 1970,<ref name=DailyMirrorKeithWaterhouseColumn>{{cite web|title=Daily Mirror|url=http://www.ukpressonline.co.uk/ukpressonline/database/search/preview.jsp?fileName=DMir_1970_06_22_001|website=UKpressOnline|access-date=25 March 2015}}</ref> on Mondays, and extending to Thursdays from 16 July 1970. Extracts from the columns were published in the books ''Mondays, Thursdays'' and ''Rhubarb, Rhubarb and Other Noises''.<ref name=JrankKeithWaterhouse>{{cite web|title=Biography|url=http://biography.jrank.org/pages/4815/Waterhouse-Keith-Spencer.html|website=Jrank Biography|access-date=25 March 2015}}</ref>

His extended style book for the ''Daily Mirror'', ''Waterhouse on Newspaper Style'',<ref>http://www.mantex.co.uk/reviews/water.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103230404/http://www.mantex.co.uk/reviews/water.htm |date=3 January 2009 }} A review and history of the book can be found here</ref> is regarded as a classic textbook for modern journalism. This was followed by a pocket book on English usage intended for a wider audience entitled ''English Our English (And How To Sing It)''. He moved from the ''Mirror'' to the ''Mail'' in 1986 out of his objection to the ''Mirror'''s ownership by [[Robert Maxwell]], and remained at the ''Mail'' until shortly before his death.

He fought long crusades to highlight what he perceived to be a decline in the standards of modern English; for example, he founded the Association for the Abolition of the [[Greengrocers' apostrophe|Aberrant Apostrophe]], whose members attempt to stem the tide of such solecisms as "potatoe's" and "pound's of apple's and orange's" in greengrocers' shops.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/data/gb1239-457/457/1/44|title=Association for the Abolition of the Aberrant Apostrophe (AAAA) - Correspondence - Papers of Keith Waterhouse (1929-2009), novelist and columnist |work= Archives Hub|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/4261922/The-apostrophes-use.html|title=The apostrophe's use|date=7 May 2001|access-date=13 April 2020|work=The Telegraph}}</ref>

In February 2004, he was voted Britain's most admired contemporary columnist by the ''[[British Journalism Review]]''.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

On 4 September 2009, a statement released by his family announced that Waterhouse had died quietly in his sleep at his home in London. He was 80.<ref name=death/>
