'''Hans Peter Wilhelm Arp''' (16 September 1886 – 7 June 1966), better known as '''Jean Arp''' in English, was a German-French sculptor, painter, and poet. He was known as a [[Dada]]ist and an [[Abstract art|abstract artist]].

==Early life==
Arp was born in [[Straßburg]] (now Strasbourg), the son of a French mother and a German father, during the period following the [[Franco-Prussian War]] when the area was known as [[Alsace-Lorraine]] (''Elsass-Lothringen'' in German) after France had ceded it to Germany in 1871. Following the return of Alsace to France at the end of World War I, French law determined that his name become "Jean". Arp would continue referring to himself as "Hans" when he spoke German.<ref name="Robertson">{{Cite book|title=Arp: Painter, Poet, Sculptor|last=Robertson|first=Eric|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2006|location=New Haven}}</ref>

==Career==
In 1904, after leaving the [[École des Arts et Métiers]] in Straßburg, he went to Paris where he published his poetry for the first time. From 1905 to 1907, he studied at [[Weimar Saxon-Grand Ducal Art School|Kunstschule]] in [[Weimar, Germany|Weimar]], Germany, and in 1908 went back to Paris, where he attended the [[Académie Julian]]. Arp was a founder-member of the Moderne Bund in Lucerne, participating in their exhibitions from 1911 to 1913.<ref name="Jean Arp">[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A11&page_number=1&template_id=6&sort_order=1&section_id=T004220 Jean Arp] [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York</ref>

In 1912 he went to Munich and called on [[Wassily Kandinsky]], the influential Russian painter and art theorist. Arp was encouraged by him in his researches and exhibited with the [[Der Blaue Reiter]] group.<ref name=NYTRussell>{{cite web|last1=Russell|first1=John|title=Jean Arp – A Pioneer Worthy of Honor|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/10/arts/art-view-jean-arp-a-pioneer-worthy-of-honor.html|work=The New York Times|date=10 August 1986}}</ref> Later that year, he took part in a major exhibition in Zürich, along with [[Henri Matisse]], [[Robert Delaunay]] and Kandinsky.<ref name=NYTRussell/> In Berlin in 1913, he was taken up by [[Herwarth Walden]], the dealer and magazine editor who was at that time one of the most powerful figures in the European avant-garde.<ref name=NYTRussell/>

In 1915 he moved to Switzerland to take advantage of Swiss neutrality. Arp later told the story of how, when he was notified to report to the German consulate in Zurich,<ref name=Richter>[[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]]", quoted in ''Dada XYZ'', 1948; archived in ''the Dada Painters & Poets: Anthology'' (2nd edition, 1981), edited by Robert Motherwell</ref> he pretended to be mentally ill in order to avoid being drafted into the German Army: after [[sign of the cross|crossing himself]] whenever he saw a portrait of [[Paul von Hindenburg]],<ref name=NYTRussell/> Arp was given paperwork on which he was told to write his date of birth on the first blank line. Accordingly, he wrote "16/9/87"; he then wrote "16/9/87" on every other line as well,<ref name=Richter/> then drew one final line beneath them and, "without worrying too much about accuracy", calculated their sum.<ref name=BretonAnthology>"[https://books.google.ca/books?id=8C8hBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT199&lpg=PT199&dq=arp+%22the+accuracy+of+his+addition%22&source=bl&ots=iVKQq5lz8e&sig=GR6Rxb1-JcRJIAeWnb44Gn2OTHk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi08v_FpfDfAhUMmeAKHUxKBuAQ6AEwAHoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&q=arp%20%22the%20accuracy%20of%20his%20addition%22&f=false Hans Arp]", by [[André Breton]], in ''[[Anthology of Black Humor]]''; originally published 1940</ref> [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], describing this story, noted that "they [the German authorities] believed him."<ref name=Richter/>

It was at an exhibition that year where he first met the artist [[Sophie Taeuber]] who was to become his collaborator in the production of works of art and a significant influence on his artistic style and working method.<ref>Carolyn Lanchner, ''Sophie Taeuber-Arp'' (New York: Museum of Modern Art, 1981) 9f</ref> They married on 20 October 1922.<ref>Carolyn Lanchner, ''Sophie Taeuber-Arp'' (New York: Museum of Modern Art, 1981) 20</ref>

In 1916 [[Hugo Ball]] opened the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich)|Cabaret Voltaire]], which was to become the centre of Dada activities in Zurich for a group that included Arp, [[Marcel Janco]], [[Tristan Tzara]], and others.<ref>[https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/artist/jean-arp Jean Arp, Guggenheim Museum]</ref> In 1920, as Hans Arp, along with [[Max Ernst]] and the social activist [[Johannes Theodor Baargeld|Alfred Grünwald]], he set up the Cologne [[Dada]] group. In 1925 his work also appeared in the first exhibition of the [[Surrealist]] group at the Galérie Pierre in Paris.<ref name="Robertson" />

In 1926 Arp moved to the Paris suburb of [[Meudon]]. In 1931 he broke with the Surrealist movement to found [[Abstraction-Création]], working with the Paris-based group Abstraction-Création and the periodical, ''Transition''. Beginning in the 1930s the artist expanded his efforts from collage and bas-relief to include bronze and stone sculptures.<ref>[[Michael Kimmelman]] (4 May 1990), [https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/04/arts/review-art-the-power-of-whimsy-jean-arp-s-later-work.html The Power of Whimsy: Jean Arp's Later Work] ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref> He produced several small works made of multiple elements that the viewer could pick up, separate, and rearrange into new configurations.<ref>[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/259 Jean Arp, ''Head and Shell (Tête et coquille)'' (ca. 1933)] [[Solomon R.

Throughout the 1930s and until the end of his life, he wrote and published essays and poetry. In 1942 he fled from his home in [[Meudon]] to escape German occupation and lived in [[Zürich]] until the war ended.
 
Arp visited New York City in 1949 for a solo exhibition at the Buchholz Gallery. In 1950 he was invited to execute a relief for the [[Harvard University]] Graduate Center in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] and would also be commissioned to do a mural at the [[UNESCO]] building in Paris. Arthur and Madeleine Lewja, of [[Galerie Chalette]], who had known Arp in Europe, became his gallery representatives in New York in the late 1950s, and were instrumental in establishing his reputation on the American side of the Atlantic.<ref>[https://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/galerie-chalette-records-6103/series-2 ''Galerie Chalette records, 1916–1999: Artist's Files, 1916–1996,'' Archives of American Art, The Smithsonian, Washington, DC]</ref>

Arp and his first wife, the artist [[Sophie Taeuber-Arp]], became French nationals in 1926.<ref name="Jean Arp"/> In the 1930s they bought a piece of land in [[Clamart]] and built a house at the edge of a forest. Influenced by the [[Bauhaus]], [[Le Corbusier]] and [[Charlotte Perriand]], Taeuber designed it.<ref name=Glimpses>Saskia De Rothschild (14 February 2013), [http://rendezvous.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/glimpses-of-jean-arps-world/ Glimpses of Jean Arp’s World] ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref> She died in [[Zürich]] in 1943 from accidental carbon monoxide poisoning.

==Legacy==
There are three Arp foundations in Europe: The Fondation Arp in Clamart preserves the atelier where Arp lived and worked for most of his life; about 2,000 visitors tour the house each year. The Fondazione Marguerite Arp-Hagenbach in [[Locarno, Switzerland]], was founded by Arp's second wife, Marguerite Arp-Hagenbach.<ref name=Glimpses/> A foundation dedicated to Arp, named Stiftung Hans Arp und Sophie Taeuber-Arp e.V., was established in 1977 by the dealer Johannes Wasmuth in consultation with Marguerite Arp-Hagenbach and owns the largest collection of works by Arp and holds the copyright of all his works. It has research centre and office in Berlin, and an office in Rolandseck, Germany.<ref>Gareth Harris (12 September 2012), [http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/Shake-up-at-Arp-foundation/27183 Shake up at Arp foundation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920000924/http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/Shake-up-at-Arp-foundation/27183 |date=20 September 2012 }} ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.</ref>
