'''Patricia Ann Jellicoe''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|OBE}}  (15 July 1927 – 31 August 2017) was a British playwright, theatre director and actress. Although her work covered many areas of theatre and film, she is best known for "pushing the envelope" of the stage play, devising new forms which challenge and delight unconventional audiences.  As a result, her dramatic career is, in many ways, unique in the twentieth century.<ref name="who1">JELLICOE, (Patricia) Ann, (Mrs Roger Mayne)', Who's Who 2011, A & C Black, 2011; online edn, Oxford University Press, Dec 2010 ; Who's Who 2016, A & C Black, 2016</ref>

==Biography==
Jellicoe was born in [[Middlesbrough]], Yorkshire in England in 1927 and from [[childhood]] showed an interest and an [[aptitude]] for the theatre.<ref name="ODNB">{{cite ODNB |doi=10.1093/odnb/9780198614128.013.90000380274 |title=Jellicoe, (Patricia) Ann (1927–2017) |year=2021 |last1=Croall |first1=Jonathan Croall|isbn=9780198614128}}</ref> She attended [[Polam Hall School]] and [[Queen Margaret's School, York]] and studied performing arts at the [[Central School of Speech and Drama]]. This was followed by experience in repertory and fringe theatre.<ref name="who1"/>

In 1949, she was commissioned to undertake an investigative study into the relationship between acting and theatre architecture; the finding of this study led her to the [[Open stage]]. Jellicoe established a Sunday Theatre Club (Cockpit Theatre Club) where she produced and directed a number of plays exploring the possibilities of this form of Open stage theatre, including a one-act of her own.<ref name="who1"/>

Thereafter, Jellicoe used many of her plays to further explore her innovative ideas on theatre. In 1956, ''[[The Observer]]'' established a playwright's competition to find new talent. Jellicoe submitted  ''The Sport of My Mad Mother'', which won a prize in the competition.<ref name="bl1">Kate Dorney. Interview with Jellicoe, deposited at British Library.</ref> In writing this play Jellicoe applied many of the ideas she had learnt in her early years at Central School. The play was subsequently staged by the [[Royal Court Theatre]] and directed by [[George Devine]] and Jellicoe. Although originally a commercial failure, the play was later performed internationally in many languages.  Set in a [[Cockney]] neighbourhood of London, it combines realism, mysticism, music, dance, and ritual to create a powerful, feminist myth about modern civilisation. Jellicoe revised the original 1958 version in 1962 to create a better play.<ref name="who1"/>

The play's title derives from a Hindu religious saying: "All creation is the sport of my mad mother Kali" (a Hindu goddess). However, as most Londoners know, "the sport of me mad mother" is also a [[Cockney]] expression implying something highly unusual.<ref name="who1"/>

Jellicoe's best known play is ''The Knack'' first performed at the Royal Court in 1962. A major hit, the play was later adapted [[The Knack …and How to Get It|into a film version]] which won the [[Palme d'Or]] at [[Cannes]].<ref name="imdb1">Internet Movie Data Base Listing. IMDB.com</ref> Directed by [[Richard Lester]]; the film's cast included [[Michael Crawford]] and [[Rita Tushingham]].<ref name="imdb1"/> In it a group of young, London adults clash and commiserate about how to get "the knack" with the opposite sex. Jellicoe has also written plays for children.<ref name="bl1"/>

One of Jellicoe's most interesting works is a brief essay entitled, "Some Unconscious Influences in the Theatre."  In a space of about thirty pages, she devises a number of complex yet common-sense theories which account for the reasons why audiences react to stage and screen as they do.

===The Colway Theatre Trust===
In 1978, Jellicoe set up the Colway Theatre Trust to explore the concept of Community Plays: pioneering work which she continued to develop over the next ten years. Jon Oram became artistic director of Colway Theatre in 1985 – now called Claque Theatre.<ref name="who1"/>

Colway Theatre Trust are the founders of the Community Play genre. A community play as practised by Colway is the result of no less than 18 months work. They are original plays written for and about a specific community. The writer generally works with a community research team. Plays are traditionally performed in a promenade style where the audience and cast share the same space with action happening on stages around the edge of that space and in the body of the standing audience. In 2000, Colway Theatre relocated to Kent in South East England and changed its name to Claque. The company is of international standing, run by Jon Oram who has written, produced or directed over 40 productions.

In 1962, Jellicoe married the photographer [[Roger Mayne]].<ref name="who1"/> They moved to [[Lyme Regis]] in Dorset in 1975, and lived at Colway Manor (hence the name of the Colway Theatre Trust). After Mayne died in 2014, Jellicoe moved to [[West Bay, Dorset|West Bay]] in Dorset.<ref name="who1"/> Jellicoe herself died at the end of August 2017.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Coveney|first1=Michael|last2=Edgar|first2=David|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/sep/01/ann-jellicoe-obituary|title=Ann Jellicoe obituary|work=The Guardian|date=1 September 2017|accessdate=1 September 2017}}</ref>
