'''Rafael Sabatini''' (29 April 1875 – 13 February 1950) was an [[Italian people|Italian]]-[[English people|English]] [[writer of novels|writer]] of [[romance novel|romance]] and [[adventure novel|adventure]] novels.<ref name=ODNB>{{Cite ODNB|id=37926|title=Sabatini, Rafael}}</ref>

He is best known for his worldwide [[bestseller]]s: ''[[The Sea Hawk]]'' (1915), ''[[Scaramouche (novel)|Scaramouche]]'' (1921), [[Captain Blood (novel)|''Captain Blood'' (a.k.a. ''Captain Blood: His Odyssey'')]] (1922), and ''[[Bellarion the Fortunate]]'' (1926).

In all, Sabatini produced 34 novels, eight short story collections, six non-fiction books, numerous uncollected short stories, and several plays.

== Biography ==
Rafael Sabatini was born in [[Iesi]], Italy, to an English mother, Anna Trafford, and Italian father, Vincenzo Sabatini. His parents were opera singers who then became teachers.<ref name=ODNB />

At a young age, Sabatini was exposed to many languages, living with his grandfather in England, attending school in [[Portugal]], and, as a teenager, in [[Switzerland]]. By the time he was 17, when he returned to England to live permanently, he had become proficient in five languages. He quickly added a sixth language – English – to his linguistic collection.  He consciously chose to write in his adopted language, because, he said, "all the best stories are written in English".<ref name= swashbucklers>{{cite book|title=The Last of the Great Swashbucklers: A Bio-Bibliography of Rafael Sabatini |first1=Jesse F.|last1=Knight|first2= Stephen |last2=Darley|year=2010|publisher=Oak Knoll |location=New Castle, [[Delaware|DE]] |ISBN=978-1-58456279-5}}</ref>

After a brief stint in the business world, Sabatini went to work as a writer. He wrote short stories in the 1890s, and his first novel came out in 1902. In 1905, he married Ruth Goad Dixon, the daughter of a [[Liverpool]] merchant. It took Sabatini roughly a quarter of a century of hard work before he attained success with ''[[Scaramouche (novel)|Scaramouche]]'' in 1921. The novel, an historical romance set during the [[French Revolution]], became an international [[bestseller]]. It was followed by the equally successful ''[[Captain Blood (novel)|Captain Blood]]'' (1922). All of his earlier books were rushed into reprints, the most popular of which was ''[[The Sea Hawk]]'' (1915). Sabatini was a prolific writer; he produced a new book approximately every year and maintained a great deal of popularity with the reading public through the decades that followed.<ref name=ODNB/>

Several of his novels were adapted into films during the [[silent era]],{{which|date=August 2015}} and the first three of these books were made into notable films in the [[sound era]]: ''[[The Sea Hawk (1940 film)|The Sea Hawk]]'' in 1940, ''[[Scaramouche (1952 film)|Scaramouche]]'' in 1952, and ''[[Captain Blood (1935 film)|Captain Blood]]'' in 1935. His third novel ''[[Bardelys the Magnificent]]'' was made into a famous 1926 "lost" [[Bardelys the Magnificent (1926 film)|film of the same title]], directed by [[King Vidor]], starring [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]], and long viewable only in a fragment excerpted in Vidor's silent comedy ''[[Show People]]'' (1928). A few intact reels have recently been discovered in Europe. The fully restored version premièred on [[Turner Classic Movies|TCM]] on 11 January 2010.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Two silent adaptations of Sabatini novels which do survive intact are [[Rex Ingram (director)|Rex Ingram]]'s ''[[Scaramouche (1923 film)|Scaramouche]]'' (1923) starring [[Ramón Novarro]], and ''[[The Sea Hawk (1924 film)|The Sea Hawk]]'' (1924) directed by [[Frank Lloyd]] and starring [[Milton Sills]]. The 1940 film ''The Sea Hawk'', with [[Errol Flynn]], is not a remake but a wholly new story which just used the title.{{citation needed |date= August 2015}} A silent version of ''[[Captain Blood (1924 film)|Captain Blood]]'' (1924), starring [[J. Warren Kerrigan]], is partly lost, surviving only in an incomplete copy in the [[Library of Congress]]. ''[[The Black Swan (film)|The Black Swan]]'' (1942) was filmed starring [[Tyrone Power]] and [[Maureen O'Hara]].

== Personal life ==
Sabatini's only son, Rafael-Angelo (nicknamed Binkie), was killed in a car crash on 1 April 1927. In 1931, Sabatini and his wife Ruth divorced. Later that year he moved from London to [[Clifford, Herefordshire]], near [[Hay-on-Wye]]. In 1935, he married the sculptor Christine Dixon ({{nee}} Wood), his former sister-in-law. They suffered further tragedy when Christine's son, Lancelot Steele Dixon, was killed in a flying accident on the day he received his [[RAF]] wings in 1940;<ref>[https://www.cwgc.org/find-records/find-war-dead/casualty-details/2965273/LANCELOT%20STEELE%20DIXON/] CWGC Casualty record Lancelot Steele Dixon</ref> he flew his aeroplane over his family's house, but the plane went out of control and crashed in flames right before the observers' eyes.<ref name=ODNB/>

By the 1940s, illness forced Sabatini to slow his prolific method of composition, though he did write several works during that time.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Sabatini died in Switzerland 13 February 1950. He was buried in [[Adelboden]], Switzerland. On his headstone his wife had written, "He was born with a gift of laughter and a sense that the world was mad", the first line of ''[[Scaramouche (novel)|Scaramouche]]''.<ref name="ChaffeeCrick2014">{{cite book|author1=Judith Chaffee|author2=Oliver Crick|title=The Routledge Companion to Commedia Dell'Arte|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BUGLBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA102|date=20 November 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-61337-4|page=102}}</ref>
