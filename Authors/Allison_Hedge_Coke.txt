'''Allison Adelle Hedge Coke''' is an American poet and editor. Her debut book, ''Dog Road Woman'', won the [[American Book Award]] and was the first finalist of the Paterson Poetry Prize and Diane DeCora Award. Since then, she has written five more books and edited eight anthologies. She is known for addressing issues of culture, prejudice, rights, the environment, peace, violence, abuse, and labor in her poetry and other creative works.<ref name="saltpublishing2" />

==Early life and education==
Coke was born in Amarillo, Texas, to a family she claims were of French-Canadian, Alsatian, English, Irish, Welsh, Portuguese, [[Cherokee]], [[Wyandot people|Huron]], and [[Muscogee]] descent. She self-identifies as Native American despite not being enrolled in any Native tribe, and claims that her paternal grandfather Vaughn "refused tribal enrollment for himself and his children" to protest the "diabolical Dawe's Act".<ref>{{cite book |last=Coke |first=Allison Adele Hedge |author-link= |date=2004 |title=Rock, Ghost, Willow, Deer: A Story of Survival |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Rock_Ghost_Willow_Deer/yc0FdKUQ-hoC?hl=en&gbpv=0 |location=Lincoln, Nebraska |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |page=5 |isbn=9780803215276}}</ref> Hedge Coke had a very non-traditional childhood educational experience, dropping out of high school to work in the crop fields to provide for herself. She then completed her GED at age 16 where she shortly after began taking community education classes at North Carolina State University, studying photography, traditional arts, and writing. Hedge Coke studied performance, directing and tech at Estelle Harmon's Actors Workshop, and went on to earn an AFAW in creative writing from the Institute for American Indian Arts (IAIA summer exchange fellow at Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics Summer Writing Program), and an MFA in poetry from Vermont College.<ref name="Harball 2018">{{cite web|last=Harball|first=Elizabeth|date=January 16, 2018|title=Allison Adelle Hedge Coke|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/allison-adelle-hedge-coke|access-date=January 16, 2018|publisher=[[Poetry Foundation]]}}</ref>

==Career==
She held a [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] Distinguished Visiting Professor/Writer appointment for [[Hartwick College]] (2004). She is an original and emeritus fellow of the Black Earth Institute Think-Tank, a [[MacDowell Colony for the Arts]] Fellow, a [[Hawthorden Castle]] Fellow, a [[Soul Mountain Retreat|Soul Mountain Fellow]], a [[Weymouth Center for the Arts and Humanities]] Fellow, a [[Lannan Foundation]] residency fellow, and a current [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln]] Center for Great Plains Studies Fellow (flagship campus). She served as the Distinguished Paul W. Reynolds and Clarice Kingston Reynolds Endowed Chair in English, and as an Associate Professor of Poetry & Creative Writing in the English Department of the [[University of Nebraska at Kearney]] (2007–2012) and University of Nebraska low-residency MFA program (2007–current).

She was visiting Artist of the [[University of Central Oklahoma]] (2012–2014), and a Distinguished Writer in Residence at the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://english.hawaii.edu/visiting-writers/|title=Visiting Writers and Distinguished Writers in Residence – Department of English, University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa}}</ref> (2014).

She has directed the annual Literary Sandhill Crane Retreat, in conjunction with her studies in migration patterning influence on flyway communities, since 2007.

==Poetry==
Hedge Coke's work ''Blood Run'', a free verse poetry collection of 66 poems, was inspired by the traditions of the Native American [[Mound Builders]] and their earthworks. ''Blood Run'' revives the history of the sites giving profound voice to humans, animals, plants and structures, also with political-ecological hope for the future to preserve ancient spiritual places.<ref name="saltpublishing" /> The poems show a mathematical patterning based on the numbers four, three and seven and on the sequence of the first 24.[[prime number|primes]].<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[American Literature (journal)|American Literature]] |url=http://americanliterature.dukejournals.org/content/82/4/807.abstract |title=Serpentine Figures, Sinuous Relations: Thematic Geometry in Allison Hedge Coke's Blood Run |first=Chadwick |last=Allen |doi=10.1215/00029831-2010-046 |year=2010 |volume=82|issue=4 |pages=807–834}}</ref> In Hedge Coke's ''Streaming'', the poem, ''America I sing you back'' was born not out of anger but concern for what she saw happening in the United States 12 years ago, alarmed by the greediness of politicians to take natural resources from the land. ''America I sing you back'' can be interpreted as an alternate view to the identity of America, following in the footsteps of Walt Whitman's poem, ''I Hear America Singing'' and Langston Hughes, ''I too''.<ref name="saltpublishing" />
