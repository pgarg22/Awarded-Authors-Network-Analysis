He began his career writing material for television in the 1950s, working alongside [[Mel Brooks]], [[Carl Reiner]], [[Larry Gelbart]], and [[Neil Simon]]. He also published several books featuring short stories and wrote humor pieces for ''[[The New Yorker]]''. In the early 1960s, he performed as a stand-up comedian in [[Greenwich Village]] alongside [[Lenny Bruce]], [[Elaine May]], [[Mike Nichols]], and [[Joan Rivers]].

By the mid-1960s, Allen was writing and directing films, first specializing in [[slapstick]] comedies such as ''[[Take the Money and Run]]'' (1969), ''[[Bananas (film)|Bananas]]'' (1971), ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'' (1973), and ''[[Love and Death]]'' (1975), before moving into dramatic material influenced by [[European art cinema]] during the late 1970s with ''[[Interiors]]'' (1978), ''[[Manhattan (1979 film)|Manhattan]]'' (1979), and ''[[Stardust Memories]]'' (1980), and alternating between comedies and dramas to the present.

His film ''[[Annie Hall]]'' (1977), a romantic comedy featuring Allen and his frequent collaborator [[Diane Keaton]], won four Academy Awards, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Keaton. Critics have called his work from the 1980s his most developed period. Those films include ''[[Zelig]]'' (1983), ''[[Broadway Danny Rose]]'' (1984), ''[[The Purple Rose of Cairo]]'' (1985), ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'' (1986), ''[[Radio Days]]'' (1987), ''[[Another Woman (1988 film)|Another Woman]]'' (1988), and ''[[Crimes and Misdemeanors]]'' (1989). In the 21st century, many of Allen's films have been set and shot in Europe, including ''[[Match Point]]'' (2005), ''[[Vicky Cristina Barcelona]]'' (2008), and ''[[Midnight in Paris]]'' (2011). Allen returned to America gaining acclaim for ''[[Blue Jasmine]]'' (2013) and ''[[Cafe Society (2016 film)|Cafe Society]]'' (2016).

In 1979, Allen began a professional and personal relationship with actress [[Mia Farrow]], and over a decade-long period they collaborated on 13 films. They separated after Allen began a relationship with Mia's and [[Andre Previn]]'s adopted daughter [[Soon-Yi Previn]].

== Career ==

=== Comedy writer ===
[[File:Woody Allen - Kup.JPG|thumb|Allen in the 1960s]]
Allen began writing short jokes when he was 15,<ref name=Kelley /> and the following year began sending them to various Broadway writers to see if they'd be interested in buying any.{{rp|539}} One of those writers was [[Abe Burrows]], coauthor of ''[[Guys and Dolls]]'', who wrote, "Wow! His stuff was dazzling." Burrows then wrote Allen letters of introduction to [[Sid Caesar]], [[Phil Silvers]], and [[Peter Lind Hayes]], who immediately sent Allen a check for just the jokes Burrows included as samples.<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|541}}

As a result of the jokes Allen mailed to various writers, he was invited, then age 19, to join the NBC Writer's Development Program in 1955, followed by a job on ''The NBC Comedy Hour'' in Los Angeles. He was later hired as a full-time writer for humorist [[Herb Shriner]], initially earning $25 a week.<ref name="timemag" /> He began writing scripts for ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', ''[[Tonight Starring Steve Allen|The Tonight Show]]'', specials for Sid Caesar post-''[[Caesar's Hour]]'' (1954–1957), and other television shows.<ref name="Lax Bio" />{{sup|p.111}} By the time he was working for Caesar, he was earning $1,500 a week. He worked alongside [[Mel Brooks]], [[Carl Reiner]], [[Larry Gelbart]], and [[Neil Simon]]. He also worked with [[Danny Simon]], whom Allen credits for helping form his writing style.<ref name="timemag" /><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/27/AR2005072702568_pf.html |title=TV Comedy Writer Danny Simon Dies |work=[[The Washington Post]] |first=Adam |last=Bernstein |access-date=January 17, 2008}}</ref> In 1962 alone he estimated that he wrote twenty thousand jokes for various comics.<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|533}} Allen also wrote for the ''[[Candid Camera]]'' television show, and appeared in some episodes.<ref name="O'Connor">{{cite news |last1=O'Connor |first1=John J. |title='Candid Camera' Marks 40 Years with a Special |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/17/arts/tv-reviews-candid-camera-marks-40-years-with-a-special.html |website=The New York Times |access-date=November 14, 2018 |date=February 17, 1987}}</ref>

He wrote jokes for the [[Buddy Hackett]] sitcom ''[[Stanley (1956 TV series)|Stanley]]'' and for ''[[The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom]],'' and in 1958 he co-wrote a few Sid Caesar specials with [[Larry Gelbart]].<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|542}} After writing for many of television's leading comedians and comedy shows, Allen was gaining a reputation as a "genius", composer [[Mary Rodgers]] said. When given an assignment for a show he would leave and come back the next day with "reams of paper", according to producer [[Max Liebman]].<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|542}} Similarly, after he wrote for [[Bob Hope]], Hope called him "half a genius".<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|542}}

His daily writing routine could last as long as 15 hours, and he could focus and write anywhere necessary. [[Dick Cavett]] was amazed at Allen's capacity to write: "He can go to a typewriter after breakfast and sit there until the sun sets and his head is pounding, interrupting work only for coffee and a brief walk, and then spend the whole evening working."<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|551}} When Allen wrote for other comedians, they would use eight out of ten of his jokes. When he began performing as a stand-up, he was much more selective, typically using only one out of ten jokes. He estimated that to prepare for a 30-minute show, he spent six months of intensive writing.<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|551}} He enjoyed writing, however, despite the work: "Nothing makes me happier than to tear open a ream of paper. And I can't wait to fill it! I love to do it."<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|551}}

Allen started writing short stories and cartoon captions for magazines such as ''[[The New Yorker]]''; he was inspired by the tradition of ''New Yorker'' humorists [[S. J. Perelman]], [[George S. Kaufman]], [[Robert Benchley]], and [[Max Shulman]], whose material he modernized.<ref>[[Daniele Luttazzi]], preface to the Italian translation of Allen's trilogy ''Complete prose'', {{ISBN|978-88-452-3307-4}} p. 7.</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C346426__422878%2C00.html |title=Deconstructing Woody|first=Ty|last=Burr| magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|access-date=May 19, 2017 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819085531/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C346426__422878%2C00.html |archive-date=August 19, 2007}}</ref><ref name="appreciate">{{cite news |last1=Allen |first1=Woody |title=I Appreciate George S.

=== Stand-up comedian ===
From 1960 to 1969 Allen performed as a comedian to supplement his comedy writing. He worked in various places around [[Greenwich Village]], including [[The Bitter End]] and [[Cafe Au Go Go]], alongside such contemporaries as [[Lenny Bruce]], the team of [[Mike Nichols]] and [[Elaine May]], [[Joan Rivers]], [[George Carlin]], [[Richard Pryor]], [[Dick Cavett]], [[Bill Cosby]] and [[Mort Sahl]] (his personal favorite), as well as such other artists of the day as [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Barbra Streisand]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/19/nyregion/19rose.html|title= Singing a Sad Song for Their Piano Bar|newspaper= [[The New York Times]]|date= July 19, 2007|access-date= October 25, 2020|last1= Ramirez|first1= Anthony}}</ref> Comedy historian [[Gerald Nachman (journalist)|Gerald Nachman]] writes that Allen, while not the first to do standup, eventually had greater impact than all the others in the 1960s, and redefined standup comedy: "He helped turn it into biting, brutally honest satirical commentary on the cultural and psychological tenor of the times."<ref name="Nachman">{{cite book |last1=Nachman |first1=Gerland |title=Seriously Funny: The Rebel Comedians of the 1950s and 1960s |url=https://archive.org/details/seriouslyfunnyre00nach |url-access=registration |date=2003 |publisher=Pantheon |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-375-41030-7 |page=525}}</ref>

After Allen was taken under the wing of his new manager, [[Jack Rollins (producer)|Jack Rollins]], who had recently discovered Nichols and May, Rollins suggested he perform his written jokes as a stand-up. Allen was resistant at first, but after seeing [[Mort Sahl]] on stage, he felt safer to give it a try: "I'd never had the nerve to talk about it before. Then [[Mort Sahl]] came along with a whole new style of humor, opening up vistas for people like me."<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|545}} Allen made his professional stage debut at the [[The Blue Angel (New York nightclub)|Blue Angel]] nightclub in [[Manhattan]] in October 1960, where comedian [[Shelley Berman]] introduced him as a young television writer who would perform his own material.<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|545}}

His early stand-up shows with his different style of humor were not always well received or understood by his audiences. Unlike other comedians, Allen spoke to his audiences in a gentle and conversational style, often appearing to be searching for words, although he was well rehearsed. He acted "normal", dressed casually, and made no attempt to project a stage "personality". And he did not improvise: "I put very little premium on improvisation," he told [[Studs Terkel]].<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|532}} His jokes were created from life experiences, and typically presented with a dead serious demeanor that made them funnier: "I don't think my family liked me. They put a live teddy bear in my crib."<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|533}}

The subjects of his jokes were rarely topical, political or socially relevant. Unlike Bruce and Sahl, he did not discuss current events such as [[Civil rights movement|civil rights]], [[women's rights]], the [[Cold War]], or [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]. And although he was described as a "classic nebbish", he did not tell the standard Jewish jokes of the period.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bh.org.il/blog-items/stars-of-david-10-jewish-hollywood-icons/|title=Let There Be Laughter – Jewish Humor Around the World|date=February 6, 2017|publisher=Beit Hatfutsot}}</ref> Comedy screenwriter [[Larry Gelbart]] compared Allen's style to Elaine May's: "He just styled himself completely after her".<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|546}} Like [[Nichols and May]], he often made fun of intellectuals.

Cavett, who was among the minority to quickly appreciate Allen's style, recalls seeing the Blue Angel audience mostly ignore Allen's [[monologue]]: "I recognized immediately that there was no young comedian in the country in the same class with him for sheer brilliance of jokes, and I resented the fact that the audience was too dumb to realize what they were getting."<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|550}} It was his subdued stage presence that eventually became one of Allen's strongest traits, Nachman argues: "The utter absence of showbiz veneer and shtick was the best shtick any comedian had ever devised. This uneasy onstage naturalness became a trademark."<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|530}} When the media finally noticed, writers like ''The New York Times''{{'}}s [[Arthur Gelb]] described Allen's nebbish quality as "[[Charlie Chaplin|Chaplinesque]]" and "refreshing".

Allen developed an anxious, nervous, and intellectual persona for his stand-up act, a successful move that secured regular gigs for him in nightclubs and on television. He brought innovation to the comedy monologue genre and his stand-up comedy is considered influential.<ref name="LuttazziScanzi2002">{{cite magazine | title=''Man on the moon'', interview with comedian Daniele Luttazzi | first=Andrea |last= Scanzi | magazine = Il mucchio selvaggio | year= 2002 | language= it }}</ref> Allen first appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' on November 1, 1963, and over nine years his guest appearances included 17 in the host's chair.

In 1979, Allen paid tribute to one of his comedy idols, [[Bob Hope]], at the [[Film at Lincoln Center|Film Society at Lincoln Center]], creating a special for the event titled "My Favorite Comedian" that included clips from Hope's films, selected and narrated by Allen.

=== Playwright ===
[[File:Woody Allen - Sam.JPG|thumb|left|Allen with the Broadway cast of ''Play It Again, Sam'' (1969)]]
In 1966 Allen wrote the play ''[[Don't Drink the Water (play)|Don't Drink the Water]]''. The play starred [[Lou Jacobi]], [[Kay Medford]], [[Anita Gillette]] and Allen's future movie co-star [[Tony Roberts (actor)|Tony Roberts]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Don't Drink the Water – Broadway Play – Original|url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/don't-drink-the-water-3347|publisher=[[Internet Broadway Database]]|access-date=July 18, 2016}}</ref> A [[Don't Drink the Water (1969 film)|film adaptation of the play]], directed by Howard Morris, was released in 1969, starring [[Jackie Gleason]]. Because he was not particularly happy with that version, in 1994 Allen directed and starred in a [[Don't Drink the Water (1994 film)|second version]] for television, with [[Michael J.

The next play Allen wrote for Broadway was ''[[Play It Again, Sam (play)|Play It Again, Sam]]'', in which he also starred. The play opened on February 12, 1969, and ran for 453 performances. It featured [[Diane Keaton]] and Roberts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Play It Again, Sam – Broadway Play – Original|url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/play-it-again-sam-2849|publisher=[[Internet Broadway Database]]|access-date=July 18, 2016}}</ref> The play was significant to Keaton's budding career, and she has said she was in "awe" of Allen even before auditioning for her role, which was the first time she met him.<ref name="O'Grady">{{cite magazine |last1=O'Grady |first1=Megan |title=Diane Keaton: The Big Picture |url=https://www.vogue.com/article/diane-keaton-the-big-picture |magazine= [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]] |access-date=November 14, 2018 |date=October 19, 2011}}</ref> In a 2013 interview Keaton said that she "fell in love with him right away", adding, "I wanted to be his girlfriend so I did something about it."<ref name=Keaton>[http://www.netquake.net/2013/06/actress-diane-keaton-talks-about-woody-allen-her-career-and-personal-life/ "Actress Diane Keaton Talks About Woody Allen, Her Career and Personal Life"], ''Netquake'', June 2, 2013 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821202143/http://www.netquake.net/2013/06/actress-diane-keaton-talks-about-woody-allen-her-career-and-personal-life/ |date=August 21, 2016 }}</ref> After co-starring alongside Allen in the subsequent [[Play It Again, Sam (film)|film version of ''Play It Again, Sam'']], she later co-starred in ''Sleeper'', ''Love and Death'', ''Annie Hall'', ''Interiors'' and ''Manhattan''.

In 1981 Allen's play ''[[The Floating Light Bulb]]'', starring [[Danny Aiello]] and [[Bea Arthur]], premiered on Broadway and ran for 65 performances.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Floating Light Bulb – Broadway Play – Original|url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/the-floating-light-bulb-4112|publisher=[[Internet Broadway Database]]|access-date=July 18, 2016}}</ref> While receiving mixed reviews, it gave autobiographical insight into Allen's childhood, specifically his fascination with magic tricks. The play, set in 1945, is a semi-autobiographical tale of a lower-middle-class family in Brooklyn. ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' critic Frank Rich gave the play a mild review, writing, "there are a few laughs, a few well-wrought characters, and, in Act II, a beautifully written scene that leads to a moving final curtain".<ref name="nytimes.com">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/28/theater/stage-light-bulb-by-woody-allen.html?pagewanted= |title = Stage: 'Light Bulb,' by Woody Allen|newspaper = The New York Times|date = April 28, 1981|last1 = Rich|first1 = Frank}}</ref> Rich also compared the play to Tennessee Williams's work.<ref name="nytimes.com"/>

=== Early films ===
Allen's first movie was the [[Charles K. Feldman]] production ''[[What's New, Pussycat?]]'' (1965), for which he wrote the screenplay. He was disappointed with the final product, which inspired him to direct every film he wrote thereafter except ''[[Play It Again, Sam (film)|Play It Again, Sam]]''.<ref name="PBSdocumentary" /> Allen's first directorial effort was ''[[What's Up, Tiger Lily?]]'' (1966, co-written with [[Mickey Rose]]), in which an existing Japanese spy movie—''[[Kokusai himitsu keisatsu: Kagi no kagi]]'' (1965), "International Secret Police: Key of Keys"—was redubbed in English by Allen and friends with fresh new, comic dialogue. In 1967 Allen played Jimmy Bond in the 007 spoof ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]''.

In 1969 Allen directed, starred in, and co-wrote (with Mickey Rose) ''[[Take the Money and Run]]'', which he considers his true film directorial debut. The film received positive reviews; critic [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "Allen has made a movie that is, in effect, a feature-length, two-reel comedy—something very special and eccentric and funny."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1969/08/19/archives/by-and-with-woody-allen-take-the-money-and-run.html|title= By and With Woody Allen: 'Take the Money and Run'|newspaper= The New York Times|date= August 19, 1969|access-date= September 14, 2020|last1= Canby|first1= Vincent}}</ref> Allen later signed a deal with [[United Artists]] to produce several films.

===1970s===
During the 1970s Allen directed films that were later known as his "early, funny" work. These include ''[[Bananas (film)|Bananas]]'' (1971, co-written with Rose), ''[[Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) (film)|Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)]]'' (1972), ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'' (1973), and ''[[Love and Death]]'' (1975).<ref name="PBSdocumentary" /> ''Sleeper'' was the first of four screenplays co-written by Allen and [[Marshall Brickman]].<ref name="Liebenson">{{cite magazine |last1=Liebenson |first1=Donald |title=The Annie Hall That Might Have Been: Inside Woody Allen's Anhedonia |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/04/annie-hall-40th-anniversary-woody-allen-carol-kane-marshall-brickman |magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|access-date=November 14, 2018 |date=April 20, 2017}}</ref><ref name="partners">{{cite book|last1=Stevens|first1=Matt |last2=Johnson|first2=Claudia |title=Script Partners: How to Succeed at Co-Writing for Film & TV: How to Succeed at Co-Writing for Film & TV|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LvbdCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA37|date=March 31, 2016|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-317-41792-7|pages=37–}}</ref>

In 1972 Allen wrote and starred in the film version of ''[[Play It Again, Sam (film)|Play It Again, Sam]]'', directed by [[Herbert Ross]] and co-starring Diane Keaton. In 1976 he starred as cashier Howard Prince in ''[[The Front]],'' directed by [[Martin Ritt]]. ''The Front'' was a humorous and poignant account of Hollywood [[blacklist]]ing during the 1950s; Ritt, screenwriter [[Walter Bernstein]], and three of Allen's cast-mates, [[Zero Mostel|Samuel "Zero" Mostel]], [[Herschel Bernardi]], and [[Lloyd Gough]], had themselves been blacklisted.

Then came two of Allen's most popular films: ''[[Annie Hall]]'' and ''[[Manhattan (film)|Manhattan]]''. ''Annie Hall'' (1977) won four [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress in a Leading Role]] for [[Diane Keaton]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Woody Allen. ''Annie Hall'' set the standard for modern romantic comedy and ignited a fashion trend with the clothes Keaton wore in the film. In an interview with journalist [[Katie Couric]], Keaton did not deny that Allen wrote the part for her and about her.<ref name=Couric>{{YouTube|blGicJHQZdo|"Annie Hall Interview with Diane Keaton by Katie Couric"}}, video interview, 2 min.</ref> The film is ranked 35th on the ''[[American Film Institute]]''{{'s}} "100 Best Movies" and fourth on the AFI list of the "100 Best Comedies."

In 1979, Allen directed ''[[Manhattan (1979 film)|Manhattan]]'', a black-and-white romantic comedy often viewed as an homage to New York City. The film features iconic scenes filmed in New York City, including an opening montage of scenes around the city, and Allen and Keaton's silhouette on a bench by the [[Queensboro Bridge]]. As in many Allen films, the main protagonists are upper-middle class writers and academics. ''Manhattan'' focuses on the complicated relationship between middle-aged Isaac Davis (Allen) and 17-year-old Tracy ([[Mariel Hemingway]]), and co-stars Diane Keaton and [[Meryl Streep]]. It was a box office and critical hit, and received two [[Academy Award]] nominations, for Hemingway for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] and for Allen's screenplay.

Keaton, who has made eight movies with Allen, has said, "He just has a mind like nobody else. He's bold. He's got a lot of strength, a lot of courage in terms of his work. And that is what it takes to do something really unique. Along with a genius imagination."<ref name=Couric />

=== 1980s ===
In 1980, on ''[[Sneak Previews]]'', [[Siskel and Ebert]] called Allen and [[Mel Brooks]] "the two most successful comedy directors in the world today&nbsp;... America's two funniest filmmakers."<ref name="siskelebert">{{cite episode| title=Take 2: Who's Funnier: Mel Brooks or Woody Allen?|series=Sneak Previews|credits=Siskel, Gene; Ebert, Roger |network=PBS|location=Chicago |airdate=May 1, 1980|season=4}}</ref> [[Pauline Kael]] wrote of Allen that "his comic character is enormously appealing to people partly because he's the smart, urban guy who at the same time is intelligent, is vulnerable, and somehow by his intelligence, he triumphs". Allen's films in the 1980s, even the comedies, became somber with philosophical undertones, influenced by European directors, especially [[Ingmar Bergman]] and [[Federico Fellini]]. ''[[Stardust Memories]]'' was based on ''[[8½]]'', which it parodies, and ''[[Wild Strawberries (film)|Wild Strawberries]]''. ''[[A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy]]'' was adapted from ''[[Smiles of a Summer Night]]''. In ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'', part of the film's structure and background is borrowed from ''[[Fanny and Alexander]]''. [[Federico Fellini|Fellini's]] ''[[Amarcord]]'' inspired ''[[Radio Days]]''. ''[[September (1987 film)|September]]'' resembles Bergman's ''[[Autumn Sonata]]''. ''[[Another Woman (1988 film)|Another Woman]]'' and ''[[Crimes and Misdemeanors]]'' have elements reminiscent of ''[[Wild Strawberries (film)|Wild Strawberries]].''<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wilmington|first1=Michael|title=Commentary: Woody Allen Keeps the Faith: 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' tears down the wall between his serious and comic sides |page=2|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1989-10-22/entertainment/ca-984_1_woody-allen-movie/2|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=April 13, 2016|date=October 22, 1989|archive-date=November 24, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151124014539/https://articles.latimes.com/1989-10-22/entertainment/ca-984_1_woody-allen-movie/2|url-status=live}}</ref>

''Stardust Memories'' (1980) features Sandy Bates, a successful filmmaker played by Allen, who expresses resentment and scorn for his fans.

''A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy'' (1982) was the first movie Allen made starring [[Mia Farrow]], who stepped into [[Diane Keaton]]'s role when Keaton was shooting ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Morgan|first1=David|title=The films of Woody Allen|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/the-films-of-woody-allen/19/|publisher=[[CBS News]]|access-date=April 13, 2016}}</ref> He next directed ''[[Zelig]]'', in which he starred as a man who has the ability to transform his appearance to that of the people surrounding him.<ref name="continues">{{cite news |last1=Canby |first1=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby|title=Woody Allen Continues to Refine His Cinematic Art |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/17/movies/woody-allen-continues-to-refine-his-cinematic-art.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=November 14, 2018 |date=July 17, 1983}}</ref>

Allen has combined tragic and comic elements in such films as ''Hannah and Her Sisters'' (1986) and ''Crimes and Misdemeanors'' (1989), in which he tells two stories that connect at the end. He also made three films about show business: ''[[Broadway Danny Rose]]'', in which he plays a down-on-his-luck New York show business agent, ''[[The Purple Rose of Cairo]]'', set during the [[Great Depression]], in which a movie character comes to life to romance an unhappy housewife, and ''[[Radio Days]]'', a film about his childhood in Brooklyn and the importance of the radio. The film co-starred Farrow in a part Allen wrote specifically for her.<ref name=Allen1 /> ''The Purple Rose of Cairo'' was named by ''Time'' as one of the 100 best films of all time.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Corliss|first1=Richard|title=Best Movies of All Time |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2005/02/12/all-time-100-movies/slide/the-purple-rose-of-cairo-1985/|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|access-date=April 13, 2016|date=January 15, 2010 }}</ref> Allen called it one of his three best films with ''Stardust Memories'' and ''[[Match Point]]''.<ref name=premiere-interview>{{cite web|url=http://www.premiere.com/article.asp?section_id=6&article_id=2539&page_number=1&print_page=y|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060317120401/http://www.premiere.com/article.asp?section_id=6&article_id=2539&page_number=1&print_page=y |archive-date=March 17, 2006 |title=Woody Allen Speaks! |author=Matloff, Jason |work=Premiere|access-date=December 1, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> By "best" he said he meant they came closest to his vision. In 1989 Allen and directors [[Francis Ford Coppola]] and [[Martin Scorsese]] made ''[[New York Stories]]'', an [[anthology film]] about New Yorkers. Allen's short, ''[[New York Stories|Oedipus Wrecks]]'', is about a neurotic lawyer and his critical mother. Film critic [[Vincent Canby]] of ''The New York Times'' praised the segment as a "priceless contribution" to the film.<ref name="wrecks">{{cite news |last1=Canby |first1=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby|title=Anthologies Can Be A Bargain |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/12/movies/film-view-anthologies-can-be-a-bargain.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=November 14, 2018 |date=March 12, 1989}}</ref>

=== 1990s ===
Allen's 1991 film ''[[Shadows and Fog]]'' is a black-and-white homage to the [[German Expressionism|German expressionists]] and features the music of [[Kurt Weill]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dowd |first1=A.A. |title=Woody does German Expressionism in Shadows and Fog |url=https://www.avclub.com/article/woody-does-german-expressionism-in-ishadows-and-fo-100754 |website=[[The A.V. Club]] |access-date=April 3, 2016|date=July 26, 2013}}</ref> Allen then made his critically acclaimed comedy-drama ''[[Husbands and Wives]]'' (1992), which received two Oscar nominations: Best Supporting Actress for [[Judy Davis]] and Best Original Screenplay for Allen. ''[[Manhattan Murder Mystery]]'' (1993) combined suspense with dark comedy and marked the return of [[Diane Keaton]], [[Alan Alda]] and [[Anjelica Huston]].

He returned to lighter fare such as the showbiz comedy involving mobsters ''[[Bullets Over Broadway]]'' (1994), which earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Director, followed by a musical, ''[[Everyone Says I Love You]]'' (1996). The singing and dancing scenes in ''Everyone Says I Love You'' are similar to musicals starring [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Ginger Rogers]]. The comedy ''[[Mighty Aphrodite]]'' (1995), in which Greek drama plays a large role, won an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for [[Mira Sorvino]]. Allen's 1999 jazz-based comedy-drama ''[[Sweet and Lowdown]]'' was nominated for two Academy Awards, for [[Sean Penn]] (Best Actor) and [[Samantha Morton]] (Best Supporting Actress). In contrast to these lighter movies, Allen veered into darker satire toward the end of the decade with ''[[Deconstructing Harry]]'' (1997) and ''[[Celebrity (1998 film)|Celebrity]]'' (1998).

During this decade Allen also starred in the television film ''[[The Sunshine Boys (1996 film)|The Sunshine Boys]]'' (1995), based on the [[Neil Simon]] [[The Sunshine Boys|play of the same name]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Evans |first1=Greg |title=Review: 'The Sunshine Boys' |url=https://variety.com/1997/tv/reviews/the-sunshine-boys-4-1200452126/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=April 3, 2016 |date=December 21, 1997}}</ref>

Allen made one sitcom "appearance" via telephone on the show ''[[Just Shoot Me!]]'' in a 1997 episode, "My Dinner with Woody", that paid tribute to several of his films. He provided the voice of Z in [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]]' first animated film, ''[[Antz]]'' (1998), which featured many actors he had worked with; Allen's character was similar to his earlier roles.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Clinton |first1=Paul |title=Review: Woody Allen still Woody in 'Antz'|url=http://edition.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Movies/9810/02/review.antz/|publisher=CNN|access-date=April 3, 2016|date=October 2, 1998}}</ref>

=== 2000s ===
''[[Small Time Crooks]]'' (2000) was Allen's first film with the [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] studio and represented a change in direction: he began giving more interviews and made an attempt to return to his slapstick roots. The film is similar to the 1942 film ''Larceny, Inc.'' (from a play by S.J. Perelman).<ref name=TCM>[[Robert Osborne]] of [[Turner Classic Movies]] on June 15, 2006</ref> Allen never commented on whether this was deliberate or if his film was in any way inspired by it. ''Small Time Crooks'' was a relative financial success, grossing over $17&nbsp;million domestically, but Allen's next four films foundered at the box office, including Allen's most costly film, ''[[The Curse of the Jade Scorpion]]'' (with a budget of $26&nbsp;million). ''[[Hollywood Ending]]'', ''[[Anything Else]]'', and ''[[Melinda and Melinda]]'' have "rotten" ratings on film-review website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and each earned less than $4&nbsp;million domestically.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/p/woody_allen |title=Woody Allen – Rotten Tomatoes Celebrity Profile |access-date=January 17, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625200602/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/p/woody_allen/ |archive-date=June 25, 2007 }}</ref> Some critics claimed that Allen's early 2000s films were subpar and expressed concern that his best years were behind him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.qwipster.net/melindamelinda.htm |title=Melinda and Melinda review (2004) Woody Allen – Qwipster's Movie Reviews |access-date=January 17, 2008}}</ref> Others were less harsh; reviewing the little-liked ''Melinda and Melinda'', [[Roger Ebert]] wrote, "I cannot escape the suspicion that if Woody had never made a previous film, if each new one was Woody's Sundance debut, it would get a better reception. His reputation is not a dead shark but an albatross, which with admirable economy Allen has arranged for the critics to carry around their own necks."<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LtJgv-f-nl8C&pg=PA451 |title=Roger Ebert's Movie Yearbook 2007|date= November 1, 2006 |access-date=January 9, 2011 |isbn=978-0-7407-6157-7 |last1=Ebert |first1=Roger }}</ref>

[[File:Woody Allen (2006).jpeg|thumb|left|upright|Allen in 2006]]

''[[Match Point]]'' (2005) was one of Allen's most successful films of the decade, garnering positive reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/match-point|title=Match Point Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |access-date=December 30, 2011}}</ref> Set in London, it starred [[Jonathan Rhys Meyers]] and [[Scarlett Johansson]]. It is markedly darker than Allen's first four films with DreamWorks SKG. In ''Match Point'' Allen shifts focus from the intellectual upper class of New York to the moneyed upper class of London. The film earned more than $23&nbsp;million domestically (more than any of his films in nearly 20 years) and over $62&nbsp;million in international box office sales.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?view=Director&id=woodallen.html |title=Box Office Mojo – People Index |access-date=January 17, 2008}}</ref> It earned Allen his first Academy Award nomination since 1998, for Best Writing&nbsp;– Original Screenplay, with directing and writing nominations at the Golden Globes, his first Globe nominations since 1987. In a 2006 interview with ''[[Premiere Magazine]]'' he said it was the best film he had ever made.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Matloff |first=Jason |date=February 2006 |title=Woody Allen's European Vacation |magazine=[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]] |volume=19 |issue=5 |pages=98–101 |quote=I think it turned out to be the best film I've ever made. |url=http://jasonmatloff.com/selected-articles/woody-allens-european-vacation/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303210547/http://jasonmatloff.com/selected-articles/woody-allens-european-vacation/|archive-date=March 3, 2016}}</ref>

Allen reached an agreement to film ''[[Vicky Cristina Barcelona]]'' in [[Avilés]], Barcelona, and [[Oviedo]], Spain, where shooting started on July 9, 2007. The movie featured [[Scarlett Johansson]], [[Javier Bardem]], [[Rebecca Hall]] and [[Penélope Cruz]].<ref name="Friedman">{{cite web |last1=Friedman |first1=Roger |title=Woody Allen's Next Star: Penelope Cruz |url=https://www.foxnews.com/story/woody-allens-next-star-penelope-cruz |website=Fox News |access-date=November 14, 2018 |date=March 25, 2015}}</ref><ref name="Hopewell">{{cite web |last1=Hopewell |first1=John |title=Spain woos Woody |url=https://variety.com/2006/film/markets-festivals/spain-woos-woody-1117935397/ |website=Variety |access-date=November 14, 2018 |date=January 3, 2006}}</ref> The film premiered at the [[2008 Cannes Film Festival]] to rapturous reviews, and became a box office success. ''Vicky Cristina Barcelona'' won [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy]] at the Golden Globe awards. Cruz received the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]].

"In the United States things have changed a lot, and it's hard to make good small films now," Allen said in a 2004 interview. "The avaricious studios couldn't care less about good films—if they get a good film they're twice as happy but money-making films are their goal. They only want these $100 million pictures that make $500 million."<ref name="Garfield">{{cite web |last1=Garfield |first1=Simon |title=Why I Love London |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/aug/08/features.review |website=The Guardian |access-date=November 14, 2018 |language=en |date=August 8, 2004}}</ref>

Allen was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2001.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|access-date=April 15, 2011}}</ref>

While best known for his films, Allen has enjoyed a successful career in theatre, starting as early as 1960, when he wrote sketches for the revue ''[[From A to Z]]''. His first great success was ''[[Don't Drink the Water (play)|Don't Drink the Water]]'', which opened in 1968, and ran for 598 performances for almost two years on Broadway. His success continued with ''[[Play It Again, Sam (play)|Play It Again, Sam]]'', which opened in 1969, starring Allen and [[Diane Keaton]]. The show played for 453 performances and was nominated for three [[Tony Awards]], although none of the nominations were for Allen's writing or acting.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Broadway League |url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=2849 |title=Internet Broadway Database: Play It Again, Sam Production Credits |publisher=Ibdb |date=March 14, 1970 |access-date=March 9, 2010}}</ref>

In the 1970s Allen wrote a number of one-act plays, most notably ''[[God (play)|God]]'' and ''[[Death (play)|Death]]'', which were published in his 1975 collection ''[[Without Feathers]]''. In 1981 Allen's play ''[[The Floating Light Bulb]]'' opened on Broadway. It was a critical success and a commercial flop. Despite two [[Tony Award]] nominations, a Tony win for the acting of [[Brian Backer]] (who won the 1981 [[Theater World Award]] and a [[Drama Desk Award]] for his work), the play only ran for 62 performances.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Broadway League |url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=4112 |title=Internet Broadway Database: The Floating Light Bulb Production Credits |publisher=Ibdb.com |access-date=March 9, 2010}}</ref> After a long hiatus from the stage, Allen returned to the theatre in 1995 with the one-act ''Central Park West'', an installment in an evening of theatre, ''Death Defying Acts'', that also included new work by [[David Mamet]] and [[Elaine May]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mamet.eserver.org/review/1995/death.html |title=Death Defying Acts and No One Shall Be Immune – David Mamet Society |publisher=Mamet.eserver.org |access-date=March 9, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100224171536/http://mamet.eserver.org/review/1995/death.html |archive-date=February 24, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In his 2020 autobiography ''[[Apropos of Nothing]]'' Allen praised [[Elia Kazan]]'s ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'' (1951): {{quote|the movie of ''Streetcar'' is for me total artistic perfection... It's the most perfect confluence of script, performance, and direction I’ve ever seen. I agree with [[Richard Schickel]], who calls the play perfect. The characters are so perfectly written, every nuance, every instinct, every line of dialogue is the best choice of all those available in the known universe. All the performances are sensational. [[Vivien Leigh]] is incomparable, more real and vivid than real people I know. And [[Marlon Brando]] was a living poem. He was an actor who came on the scene and changed the history of acting. The magic, the setting, New Orleans, the French Quarter, the rainy humid afternoons, the poker night. Artistic genius, no holds barred.}}

== Film activism and preservation ==
{{main|The Film Foundation}}

In 1987, Allen joined [[Ginger Rogers]], [[Sydney Pollack]], and [[Miloš Forman]] at a [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary committee]] hearing in Washington, D.C., where they each gave testimony against [[Ted Turner]]'s and other companies' colorizing films without the artists' consent.<ref name="Film Stars Protest Coloring">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/13/movies/film-stars-protest-coloring.html|title= Film Stars Protest Coloring|newspaper= [[The New York Times]]|date= May 13, 1987|access-date= May 20, 2020|last1= Dowd|first1= Maureen}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?56772-1/colorization-black-white-movies|title= Colorization of Black-and-White Movies|website= [[C-Span]]|access-date= May 20, 2020}}</ref> Only one senator, [[Patrick Leahy]], was present for the testimony. Allen testified:
{{quote|If directors had their way, we would not let our films be tampered with in any way—broken up for commercial or shortened or colorized. But we've fought the other things without much success, and now colorization—because it's so horrible and preposterous and more acutely noticeable by audiences—is the straw that broke the camel's back...The presumption that colorizers are doing him [the director] a favor and bettering his movie is a transparent attempt to justify the mutilation of art for a few extra dollars.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1987/08/13/true-colors/|title= True Colors|website= [[New York Review of Books]]|access-date= May 20, 2020|last1= Allen|first1= Woody}}</ref>}}

Allen also spoke about his decisions to make films in black and white, such as ''[[Manhattan (1979 film)|Manhattan]]'', ''[[Stardust Memories]]'', ''[[Broadway Danny Rose]]'', and ''[[Zelig]]''. Film director [[John Huston]] appeared in a pre-taped video, and Rogers read a statement by [[Jimmy Stewart]] criticizing the colorization of his film ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]''.<ref name="Film Stars Protest Coloring" />

In 1990, Allen and [[Martin Scorsese]] created [[The Film Foundation]], a nonprofit [[film preservation]] organization that collaborates with film studios to restore prints of old or damaged films. Allen sat on the foundation's original board of directors alongside [[Robert Altman]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Stanley Kubrick]], [[George Lucas]], [[Sydney Pollack]], [[Robert Redford]], and [[Steven Spielberg]].<ref>Cruickshank, Douglas.

== Personal life ==
Allen has been married three times: to Harlene Rosen from 1956 to 1959, [[Louise Lasser]] from 1966 to 1970, and [[Soon-Yi Previn]] since 1997. He also had a 12-year relationship with actress [[Mia Farrow]] and relationships with [[Stacey Nelkin]] and [[Diane Keaton]].

=== Early marriages and relationships ===
In 1956, Allen married Harlene Rosen. He was 20 and she was 17. The marriage lasted until 1959.<ref name="timemag-3">{{cite news|title=Woody Allen: Rabbit Running|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,877848-3,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501134517/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,877848-3,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 1, 2008 |work=Time |page=3 |date=July 3, 1972 |access-date=August 4, 2009}}</ref> Rosen, whom Allen called "the Dread Mrs. Allen" in his standup act, sued him for [[defamation]] as a result of comments he made during a television appearance shortly after their divorce. In his mid-1960s album ''Standup Comic'', Allen said that Rosen had sued him because of a joke he made in an interview. Rosen had been [[Rape|sexually assaulted]] outside her apartment. According to Allen, the newspapers reported that she had been "violated". In the interview, Allen said, "Knowing my ex-wife, it probably wasn't a [[moving violation]]." In an interview on ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'', Allen repeated his comments and said he had been sued for "$1&nbsp;million".<ref name="CavettTube">{{cite web|title=Dick & Woody discuss particle physics|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xq5Nh2UqCc#t=309|access-date=November 18, 2013}}</ref>

In 1966, Allen married [[Louise Lasser]]. They divorced in 1970. Lasser provided voice dubbing in Allen's ''[[What's Up, Tiger Lily?]]'' and appeared in three of his other films: ''[[Take the Money and Run]]'', ''[[Bananas (film)|Bananas]]'', and ''[[Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) (film)|Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)]]''. She also appeared briefly in ''[[Stardust Memories]]''.

According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[Manhattan (1979 film)|Manhattan]]'' was based on Allen's romantic relationship with actress [[Stacey Nelkin]].<ref name="Nelkin">{{cite web|title=Stacey Nelkin|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-hween-teen-nelkin-photo.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521124823/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-hween-teen-nelkin-photo.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 21, 2014|access-date=September 3, 2018|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref> Her bit part in ''[[Annie Hall]]'' ended up on the [[cutting room floor]], and their relationship, never publicly acknowledged by Allen, reportedly began when she was 17 and a student at [[Stuyvesant High School]] in New York.<ref name="Fox1996">{{cite book|last1=Fox|first1=Julian|url=https://archive.org/details/woodymoviesfromm0000foxj/page/111|title=Woody: Movies from Manhattan|date=1996|publisher=Overlook Press|isbn=978-0879516925|location=Woodstock, New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/woodymoviesfromm0000foxj/page/111 111–112]}}</ref><ref name="Bailey2001">{{cite book|last1=Bailey|first1=Peter J.|title=The Reluctant Film Art of Woody Allen|date=2001|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=978-0813190419|page=61}}</ref><ref>[[John Baxter (author)|Baxter]], pp. 226, 248, 249, 250, 253, 273–74, 385, 416.</ref> In December 2018 ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' interviewed Babi Christina Engelhardt, who said she had an eight-year affair with Allen that began in 1976 when she was 17 years old (they met when she was 16), and that she believes the character of Tracy in ''Manhattan'' is a composite of any number of Allen's presumed other real-life young paramours from that period, not necessarily Nelkin or Engelhardt.

=== Diane Keaton ===
In 1969, Allen cast [[Diane Keaton]] in his Broadway show ''[[Play It Again, Sam (film)|Play It Again, Sam]].'' During the run she and Allen became romantically involved. Although they broke up after a year, she continued to star in his films, including ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'' as a futuristic poet and ''[[Love and Death]]'' as a composite character based on the novels of [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky]]. ''[[Annie Hall]]'' was very important in Allen's and Keaton's careers. It is said that the role was written for her, as Keaton's birth name was Diane Hall. She then starred in ''[[Interiors]]'' as a poet, followed by ''[[Manhattan (1979 film)|Manhattan]]''. In 1987, she had a cameo as a nightclub singer in ''[[Radio Days]]'', and she was chosen to replace [[Mia Farrow]] in ''[[Manhattan Murder Mystery]]'' after Allen and Farrow began having problems with their relationship. In total Keaton has starred in eight of Allen's films.

In an August 1992 interview with ''[[Time Magazine]]'' Allen said, "I am not Soon-Yi's father or stepfather", adding, "I've never even lived with Mia.
