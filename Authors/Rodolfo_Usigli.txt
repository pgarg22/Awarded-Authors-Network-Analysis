==Biography==
Usigli was born to an [[Italy|Italian]] father and a [[Poland|Polish]] mother in [[Mexico City]]. In his early childhood, he enjoyed many plays that his parents took him to. His father aspired him to go to music school, and Usigli spent a year in the [[Conservatorio Nacional de Música (Mexico)|National Conservatory of Music]] before deciding that his real passion was theater. He studied drama at the [[Yale School of Drama]] from 1935-1936 on a [[Rockefeller Foundation|Rockefeller]] scholarship, later becoming a professor and diplomat. It was during his time as a diplomat in 1945 that he met [[George Bernard Shaw]] in [[London]].<ref name="Rodolfo Usigli and George Bernard Shaw">{{cite web|title=Rodolfo Usigli and George Bernard Shaw Finding Aid|url=http://spec.lib.miamioh.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Usigli-Shaw-Finding-Aid-Revised-7-15-11.pdf|access-date=20 February 2014}}</ref> After returning to Mexico from the U.S., he established the Midnight Theater and also became a member of the literary circle that formed around the journal Contemporary.<ref name="Rodolfo Usigli">{{cite web|title=Rodolfo Usigli|url=http://www.biografiasyvidas.com/biografia/u/usigli.htm|publisher=Biographies & Lives|access-date=12 March 2013}}</ref>  During the 1930s, he directed [[radio drama]]s.

== Theatre ==
Usigli’s theater focuses largely the history of Mexico and satirizing his contemporary Mexican society,<ref name=":2" />{{Rp|3811}} and how the Mexican middle classes were betrayed, politically and socially, by the Mexican revolution.<ref name=":3" />{{Rp|307}} His plays reflect a sense of the hypocrisies of life after the revolution, both criticizing society and offering models to emulate.<ref name=":2" />{{Rp|3811}} He called for a national theater movement that would reflect the truth of the Mexican experience and express the Mexican spirit.<ref name=":2" />{{Rp|3811}}<ref name=":3" />{{Rp|308}}

He is perhaps best known for his 1938 play ''[[El gesticulador]] (The Imposter)'', which critiqued social issues ravaging Mexico, such as misuse of power that the bureaucracy had got from the Revolution of 1910. The play was [[censorship|censored]] by the Mexican government banned, raising Usigli's reputation.<ref name="Rodolfo Usigli" />

In 1942 Usigli published another work of scathing quality. In ''Family Dinner at Home''' his intended target were the apex strata of the Mexican social structure. Usigli experimented with [[crime fiction]] in the novel, ''Ensayo de un crimen'' (''Rehearsal for a Crime''), which in 1955 was adapted into a film, [[The Criminal Life of Archibaldo de la Cruz]], by [[Luis Buñuel]]. Usigli also wrote several essays on history, art and theater. He was also an [[occasional poetry|occasional poet]], writing modest but interesting poems.<ref name="Rodolfo Usigli"/>

The award-winning Usigli believed the objective of theatre was to tell the truth about society.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} He was known for his strong representation of women in plays.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Layera|first=Ramón|date=2006|title=Rodolfo Usigli Centennial: An Interdisciplinary Commemoration|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/content/crossref/journals/latin_american_theatre_review/v040/40.1.layera01.html|journal=Latin American Theatre Review|language=en|volume=40|issue=1|pages=179–182|doi=10.1353/ltr.2006.0046|issn=2161-0576}}</ref>{{Rp|181–182}}

Usigli designed strong female characters in several of his plays. Two of Usigli's protégées, [[Rosario Castellanos]] and [[Luisa Josefina Hernández]], became important female voices on the Mexican stage. He was also a strong influence on his pupil [[Jorge Ibargüengoitia]] and on [[Josefina Niggli]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}
