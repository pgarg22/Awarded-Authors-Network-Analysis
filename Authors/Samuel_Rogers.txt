'''Samuel Rogers''' (30 July 1763 – 18 December 1855) was an [[English poetry|English poet]], during his lifetime one of the most celebrated, although his fame has long since been eclipsed by his [[Romanticism|Romantic]] colleagues and friends [[Wordsworth]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] and [[Byron]]. His recollections of these and other friends such as [[Charles James Fox]] are key sources for information about London artistic and literary life, with which he was intimate, and which he used his wealth to support.  He made his money as a banker and was also a discriminating art collector.

==Early life and family==
Rogers was born at [[Newington Green]], then a village north of [[Islington]], and now in [[Inner London]]. His father, [[Thomas Rogers (MP)|Thomas Rogers]], a banker and briefly [[Coventry (UK Parliament constituency)|MP for Coventry]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mitchell, Hughes and Clarke |title=Miscellanea genealogica et heraldica |date=1877 |page=259 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dkzma4LvHMQC&pg=PA260|access-date=27 August 2018}}</ref> was the son of a [[Stourbridge]] glass manufacturer, who was also a merchant in [[Cheapside]]. Thomas married Mary, the only daughter of his father's partner, Daniel Radford, becoming himself a partner shortly afterwards. On his mother's side Samuel Rogers was connected with the well-known Welsh Dissenting clergymen [[Philip Henry (clergyman)|Philip Henry]] and [[Matthew Henry|his son Matthew]], was brought up in [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformist]] circles, and became a long-standing member of the [[Newington Green Unitarian Church|Unitarian congregation at Newington Green]], then led by the remarkable Dr [[Richard Price]]. He was educated in [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] and [[Stoke Newington]].

Two nephews, orphaned young and for whom he assumed responsibility, were [[Samuel Sharpe (scholar)|Samuel Sharpe]], the [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]] and [[Bible translations|translator of the Bible]], and [[Daniel Sharpe|his younger brother Daniel]], the early geologist.

==The young man==
Samuel Rogers wished to enter the [[English Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] ministry, but his father persuaded him to join the banking business in [[Cornhill, London|Cornhill]]. In long holidays, necessitated by delicate health, Rogers became interested in [[English literature]], particularly the work of [[Samuel Johnson]], [[Thomas Gray]] and [[Oliver Goldsmith]]. He learned Gray's poems by heart, and his family wealth allowed him to leisure to try writing poetry himself.  He began with contributions to the ''[[Gentleman's Magazine]]'', and in 1786 he published a volume containing some imitations of Goldsmith and an "Ode to Superstition" in the style of Gray.

In 1788 his elder brother Thomas died, and Samuel's business responsibilities were increased. In the next year he paid a visit to Scotland, where he met [[Adam Smith]], [[Henry Mackenzie]], [[Hester Thrale]] and others. In 1791 he was in Paris, and enjoyed the [[Orleans Collection]] of art at the [[Palais Royal]], many of the treasures of which were later to pass into his possession. With Gray as his model, Rogers took great pains in polishing his verses, and six years elapsed after the publication of his first volume before he printed his elaborate poem on ''The Pleasures of Memory'' (1792) – regarded by some as the last embodiment of the poetic diction of the 18th century. The theory of elevating and refining familiar themes by abstract treatment and lofty imagery is taken to extremes. In this art of "raising a subject", as the 18th century phrase was, the ''Pleasures of Memory'' is much more perfect than [[Thomas Campbell (poet)|Thomas Campbell]]'s ''Pleasures of Hope'', published a few years later in imitation. [[George Gordon Byron, Lord Byron|Byron]] said of it, "There is not a vulgar line in the poem."

==Middle life and friendships==
In 1793 his father's death gave Rogers the principal share in the banking house in Cornhill, and a considerable income. He left [[Newington Green]] and established himself in [[Chambers (law)|chambers in the Temple]]. Within his intimate circle at this time were his best friend, Richard Sharp ([[Conversation Sharp]]), and the artists [[John Flaxman]], [[John Opie]], [[Martin Archer Shee|Martin Shee]] and [[John Henry Fuseli]]. He also made the acquaintance of [[Charles James Fox]], with whom he visited the galleries in Paris in 1802, and whose friendship introduced him to [[Holland House, London|Holland House]]. In 1803 he moved to 22 [[St James's Place]], where for fifty years he entertained all the celebrities of London. Flaxman and [[Charles Alfred Stothard]] had a share in the decoration of the house, which Rogers virtually rebuilt, and proceeded to fill with works of art. His collections at his death realised £50,000.

In the mid-nineteenth century, social breakfasts were in vogue in London. Rogers hosted social breakfasts with guests such as [[Thomas Macaulay]], [[Henry Hallam]], [[Sydney Smith]], [[George Howard, 7th Earl of Carlisle]], [[Philip Stanhope, 5th Earl Stanhope]], [[Nassau Senior]], [[Charles Greville (diarist)|Charles Greville]], [[Henry Hart Milman]], [[Anthony Panizzi]], [[George Cornewall Lewis]], and [[Sylvain Van de Weyer]].<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Macaulay, Thomas Babington Macaulay, Baron}}</ref> An invitation to one of Rogers's breakfasts was a formal entry into literary society, and his dinners were even more select. His social success was due less to his literary position than to his powers as a conversationalist, his educated taste in all matters of art, and no doubt to his sarcastic and bitter wit, for which he excused himself by saying that he had such a small voice that no one listened if he said pleasant things. "He certainly had the kindest heart and unkindest tongue of any one I ever knew," said [[Fanny Kemble]]. He helped the poet [[Robert Bloomfield]], he reconciled [[Thomas Moore]] with [[Francis Jeffrey, Lord Jeffrey|Francis Jeffrey]] and with Byron, and he relieved [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Sheridan]]'s difficulties in the last days of his life. Moore, who refused help from all his friends, and would only owe debts to his publishers, found it possible to accept help from Rogers. He procured a pension for [[Henry Francis Cary|HF Cary]], the translator of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], and obtained [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] his sinecure as distributor of stamps. [[John Mitford (clergyman)|John Mitford]], while maintaining his country livings, rented permanent lodgings in Sloane Street, where he enjoyed "the most perfect intimacy with Samuel Rogers for more than twenty years".<ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=John Mitford (1781&ndash;1859)}}</ref>

Rogers was in effect a literary dictator in England. He made his reputation by ''The Pleasures of Memory'' when [[William Cowper]]'s fame was still in the making. He became the friend of Wordsworth, [[Walter Scott]] and Byron, and lived long enough to give an opinion as to the fitness of [[Alfred Tennyson]] for the post of [[Poet Laureate]]. [[Alexander Dyce]], from the time of his first introduction to Rogers, was in the habit of writing down the anecdotes with which his conversation abounded. In 1856 he arranged and published selections as ''Recollections of the Table-Talk of Samuel Rogers'', to which is added ''Porsoniana''. Rogers himself kept a notebook in which he entered impressions of the conversation of many of his distinguished friends—Fox, [[Edmund Burke]], [[Henry Grattan]], [[Richard Porson]], [[John Horne Tooke]], [[Talleyrand]], [[Lord Erskine]], Scott, Lord Grenville and the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]. They were published by his nephew William Sharpe in 1859 as ''Recollections by Samuel Rogers''; ''Reminiscences and Table-Talk of Samuel Rogers, Banker, poet, and Patron of the Arts, 1763–1855'' (1903), by GH Powell, is an amalgamation of these two authorities.

Rogers held various honorary positions: he was one of the trustees of the [[National Gallery]]; and he served on a commission to inquire into the management of the [[British Museum]], and on another for the rebuilding of the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]]. He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in November 1796.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Persons&dsqPos=9&dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27rogers%27%29|title= Library and Archives Catalogue|publisher= The Royal Society|access-date= 8 October 2010}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

==Later life==
[[File:Samuel Rogers b1763.jpg|thumb|A photograph of Samuel Rogers]]
His literary production remained slow. ''An Epistle to a Friend'' (the above-mentioned [[Conversation Sharp]]), published in 1798, describes Rogers's ideal of a happy life. This was followed by ''The Voyage of Columbus'' (1810), and by ''Jacqueline'' (1814), a [[narrative poem]], written in the [[Time signature|four-accent measure]] of the newer writers, and published in the same volume with Byron's ''Lara''. His reflective poem on ''Human Life'' (1819), on which he had been engaged for twelve years, is written in his earlier manner.

In 1814 Rogers made a tour on the Continent with his sister Sarah. He travelled through Switzerland to Italy, keeping a full diary of events and impressions, and had made his way to [[Naples]] when the news of [[Napoleon]]'s escape from [[Elba]] obliged him to hurry home. Seven years later he returned to Italy, paying a visit to Byron and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]] at [[Pisa]]. Out of the earlier of these tours arose his last and longest work, ''Italy''. The first part was published anonymously in 1822; the second, with his name attached, in 1828. It was at first a failure, but Rogers was determined to make it a success. He enlarged and revised the poem, and commissioned illustrations from [[J.M.W. Turner]], [[Thomas Stothard]] and [[Samuel Prout]]. These were engraved on steel in the sumptuous edition of 1830. The book then proved a great success, and Rogers followed it up with an equally sumptuous edition of his ''Poems'' (1834). In 1850, on Wordsworth's death, Rogers was asked to succeed him as [[poet laureate]], but declined the honour on account of his age. For the last five years of his life he was confined to his chair in consequence of a fall in the street. He died in London at 92, a remarkable age for the time, and is buried in the family tomb in the churchyard of [[Hornsey (parish)|St Mary's Church]], [[Hornsey]] High Street, [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey]].<ref>{{NHLE|num=1244865 |desc=Monument to Samuel Rodgers and family in north east corner of St Marys Churchyard |accessdate=25 May 2009}}</ref>
