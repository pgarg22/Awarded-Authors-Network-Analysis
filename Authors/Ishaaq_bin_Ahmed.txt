Sheikh Ishaaq purportedly traveled from the [[Arabian peninsula]] to [[Somaliland]] in the 12th or 13th century, where he is supposed to have married into the Somali [[Dir (clan)|Dir clan]]. He is said to have settled in what is today the [[Erigavo District]], and to have established his capital at [[Maydh]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=Ioan|author1-link=Ioan Lewis|date=1960|title=The Somali Conquest of the Horn of Africa|journal=Journal of African History|volume=1|issue=2|pages=213–230|doi=10.1017/S0021853700001808|jstor=180241|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/180241}} p. 219.</ref> The stories surrounding Sheikh Ishaaq have played an important role in establishing and reinforcing the Arab and Muslim identity of the Isaaq clan.<ref name="Lewis1994" />

== Migrations ==

The traditional [[hagiology|hagiologies]] of the Isaaq clan describe how Sheikh Isaaq first made a series of travels through [[Arabia]], before sailing to the ancient Somali port of [[Zeila]] and continuing his travels through Somaliland and some regions of [[Ethiopia]], finally settling in [[Maydh]].<ref name="Lewis1994">{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Ioan M.|author1-link=Ioan Lewis|date=1994|title=Blood and Bone: The Call of Kinship in Somali Society|location=Lawrencewill, NJ|publisher=The Red Sea Press|isbn=0-932415-93-8|pages=103–104|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9fAjtruUXjEC}}</ref> These stories, as detailed below, are more akin to myths than to history, although they do probably reflect a historical settlement of Arab immigrants in medieval Somaliland.<ref name="Lewis1994"/>

=== Early life ===

After the death of Sheikh Ishaaq's grandfather he went on a series of migrations in order to study further and [[Dawah|preach Islam]]. He first preached in Mecca and then travelled to [[Egypt]], and hence to [[Eritrea]] and Zeila.<ref name=":5">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/dierk-lange-ancient-kingdoms-of-west-africa-1|title=Dierk Lange Ancient Kingdoms Of West Africa 1}}</ref> He then later settled in the area of Saba' in modern-day [[Yemen]] where he married the sister of the king of the Al Haqar clan.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|last=نور|first=مكتبة|title=تحميل كتاب تحفة المشتاق لنسب السيد إسحاق لعبدالرحمن دبة pdf|url=https://www.noor-book.com/كتاب-تحفه-المشتاق-لنسب-السيد-اسحاق-لعبدالرحمن-دبه-pdf|access-date=2021-08-08|website=www.noor-book.com|language=ar}}</ref> She bore him two sons; Dir'an and Shareef, whose descendants are the Al Dir'an and Al-Ashraf clans respectively.<ref name=":3" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=Reer Shiekh Isaxaaq|url=https://qabaayil.webs.com/reershiekhisaxaaq.htm|access-date=2021-08-09|website=Hoyga Qabaayilka Reer Sheekh Isaxaaq}}</ref> Sheikh Ishaaq later settled in the [[Al Jawf Governorate|Al-Jawf]] region in northern Yemen where he married once again and had a son, Mansur, who is the forefather of the Al Mansur clan in the Al-Jawf region.

=== Arrival in the Horn of Africa ===
Sheikh Ishaaq then continued his journey and migrated to [[Zeila]], [[Somaliland]] and finally [[Harar]] in [[Ethiopia]].<ref name=":4">{{Cite book|last=الاسحاقي الصومالي|first=عبدالرحمن|title=كتاب تحفة المشتاق لنسب السيد اسحاق}}</ref> Several accounts indicate [[Yusuf bin Ahmad al-Kawneyn|Shaykh Yusuf al Kownayn]] and Sheikh Isaaq were known to be contemporaries in Zeila and in contact at the same time.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lewis|first=I.

<blockquote>Since, however, Aw Barkhadle’s precise connection with the rulers of Ifat is not widely known, he appears as an isolated figure, and in comparison with the million or so spears of the Isaaq lineage, a saint deprived of known issue. The striking difference between these two saints is explained in a popular legend, according to which, when Sheikh Isaaq and Aw Barkhadle met, the latter prophesised that Isaaq would be blessed by God with many children. He, however, would not have descendants, but Isaaq’s issue would pay him respect and ''siyaaro'' (voluntary offerings). So it is, one is told, that every year the Isaaq clansmen gather at Aw Barkhadle’s shrine to make offerings in his name.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lewis |first1=I.

After studying and proselytizing in Harar he then undertook the pilgrimage to Mecca, came back to Somaliland and went along the shore eastward to the coastal town of Maydh in eastern [[Somaliland]], where he converted the pagan peoples to Islam.<ref name=":5" /> He later settled in the town aged 60,<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=يحيى|first=بن نصر الله الهرري|title=مناقب الشيخ أبادر- متحف الشريف عبد الله في هرر}}</ref> where he married two women; one of the [[Dir (clan)|Magaadle Dir]] tribe called Magaado, and a [[Harari people|Harari]] woman called Xiis Xaniifa, the daughter of a Harari emir, with descendants belonging to the ''Habar Magaadle'' or ''Habar Habusheed'' branches respectively.<ref name=":5" /><ref name="Lewis3">I.M.

== Lineage ==
Most Arabic hagiologies are in agreement when it comes to the alleged lineage of Sheikh Ishaaq, tracing his lineage to [[Ali|Ali bin Abi Talib]], the cousin and son-in-law of the Islamic [[Muhammad|prophet Muhammad]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|last=Gori|first=Alessandro|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/55104439|title=Studi sulla letteratura agiografica islamica somala in lingua araba|date=2003|publisher=Dipartimento di linguistica, Università di Firenze|isbn=88-901340-0-3|location=Firenze|pages=72|oclc=55104439}}</ref> However, according to I.M Lewis, the long [[genealogy]] which members of the Isaaq clan trace their lineage through, given the preponderance of names belonging to early Islamic Arabia (i.e., the time of the prophet [[Muhammad]]) rather than to medieval Somali-Arab culture, is very unlikely to be genuine.<ref name="Lewis1994" /> I.M Lewis further elaborates that the genealogy is apparently 'Arabicized' with the goal of enhancing the prestige of the Isaaq among the many ethnic groups in modern and contemporary Somalia.<ref name="Lewis1994" />

The lineage attributed to Sheikh Ishaaq by two Arabic hagiologies, and which is covered by Alessandro Gori in ''Studi sulla letteratura agiografica islamica somala in lingua araba'', is the following;<ref name=":2" />

''Ash-Shaykh Ishaaq bin Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Husayn bin Ali bin Muhammad bin Hamza al-Muttahar bin Abdallah bin Ayyub bin Qasim bin Ahmad bin Ali bin Isa bin Yahya bin Muhammad al-Taqi bin [[Hasan al-Askari]] bin [[Ali al-Hadi]] bin [[Muhammad al-Jawad]] bin [[Ali al-Ridha]] bin [[Musa al-Kadhim]] bin [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]] bin [[Muhammad al-Baqir]] bin [[Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin|Ali Zayn Al-Abidin]] bin [[Hussein|Husayn]] bin [[Ali|Ali bin Abi Talib]]''.<ref name=":2" />

In the Isaaq clan-family, component clans are divided into two uterine divisions, as shown in the genealogy. The first division is between those lineages descended from sons of Sheikh Ishaaq by a [[Harari people|Harari]] woman – the Habr Habusheed – and those descended from sons of Sheikh Ishaaq by a [[Somali people|Somali]] woman of the Magaadle sub-clan of the [[Dir (clan)|Dir]] – the Habr Magaadle. Indeed, most of the largest clans of the clan-family are in fact uterine alliances hence the matronymic "Habr" which in archaic [[Somali language|Somali]] means "mother".<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=I.

There is clear agreement on the clan and sub-clan structures that has not changed for a long time. The oldest recorded genealogy of a Somali in Western literature was by Sir Richard Burton in the mid–19th century regarding his Isaaq (Habr Yunis) host and the governor of [[Zeila]], [[Sharmarke Ali Saleh]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Burton.

== Legacy ==
According to genealogical books and Somali tradition, the Isaaq clan was founded in the 13th or 14th century with the arrival Sheikh Ishaaq from [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]] in [[Maydh]].<ref name="McGown"/><ref name="Lewis">I.M. Lewis, ''A Modern History of the Somali'', fourth edition (Oxford: James Currey, 2002), p. 22</ref> He settled in the coastal town of [[Maydh]] in modern-day northeastern [[Somaliland]], where he married into the local Magaadle clan.<ref name="Lewis3"/>

There are also numerous existing [[Isaaq#Historical publications|hagiologies]] in Arabic which describe Sheikh Ishaaq's travels, works and overall life in modern Somaliland, as well as his movements in Arabia before his arrival.<ref name="RolandAnthony">Roland Anthony Oliver, J. D. Fage, ''Journal of African history, Volume 3'' (Cambridge University Press.: 1962), p.45</ref> Besides historical sources, one of the more recent printed biographies of Sheikh Ishaaq is the ''Amjaad'' of Sheikh Husseen bin Ahmed Darwiish al-Isaaqi as-Soomaali, which was printed in [[Aden]] in 1955.<ref name="Lewis4">I. M. Lewis, ''A pastoral democracy: a study of pastoralism and politics among the Northern Somali of the Horn of Africa'', (LIT Verlag Münster: 1999), p.131.</ref>

His descendants would later on form two powerful sultanates that would later on dominate the northern coastline of the [[Horn of Africa]] during the early modern era; the [[Isaaq Sultanate|Isaaq]] sultanate and the [[Habr Yunis Sultanate|Habr Yunis]] sultanate.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Taariikhda Beerta Suldaan Cabdilaahi ee Hargeysa {{!}} Somalidiasporanews.com|url=http://www.qurbejoog.com/taariikhda-beerta-suldaan-cabdilaahi-ee-hargeysa/|access-date=2021-01-09|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Genealogies of the Somal|date=1896|publisher=Eyre and Spottiswoode (London)|language=english}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Taariikhda Saldanada Reer Guuleed Ee Somaliland.Abwaan:Ibraahim-rashiid Cismaan Guure (aboor). {{!}} Togdheer News Network|url=http://togdheernews.com/articles/31/05/2016/taariikhda-saldanada-reer-guuleed-ee-somaliland-abwaanibraahim-rashiid-cismaan-guure-aboor/|access-date=2021-08-09|language=en-US}}</ref>

As part of the modern attempts to 'Arabicize' the genealogy of the Isaaq, Sheikh Isaaq's lineage has been traced by hagiologists to [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]], the cousin and son-in-law of the prophet Muhammad. This lineage is likely false, and mainly serves to stress the Muslim background of Somali culture.<ref name="Lewis1994"/>

=== Tomb ===
Sheikh Ishaaq's tomb is in [[Maydh]], and is the scene of frequent pilgrimages.<ref name="RolandAnthony" /> Sheikh Ishaaq's ''[[mawlid]]'' (birthday) is also celebrated every Thursday with a public reading of his ''manaaqib'' (a collection of glorious deeds).<ref name="Lewis3" /> His [[Ziyarat|siyaara]] or pilgrimage is performed annually both within Somaliland and in the diaspora particularly in the Middle East among Isaaq expatriates. The tomb was kept by the family of Somali artist [[Abdullahi Qarshe]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hassan|first=Mohamed-Rashid|date=2008-11-04|title=Interview with the late Abdullahi Qarshe (1994) at the Residence of Obliqe Carton in Djibouti|url=https://digitalcommons.macalester.edu/bildhaan/vol2/iss1/5|journal=Bildhaan: An International Journal of Somali Studies|volume=2|issue=1|pages=65|issn=1528-6258}}</ref>
