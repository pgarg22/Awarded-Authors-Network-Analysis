'''William Manhire''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|CNZM}} (born 27 December 1946) is a New Zealand poet, short story writer, [[emeritus]] professor, and New Zealand's inaugural [[New Zealand Poet Laureate|Poet Laureate]] (1997–1998). He founded New Zealand's first creative writing course at [[Victoria University of Wellington]] in 1975, and has been a strong promoter of New Zealand literature and poetry throughout his career. Many of New Zealand's leading writers graduated from his course.<ref name="ANZL">{{cite web |title=Bill Manhire |url=https://www.anzliterature.com/member/bill-manhire/ |website=Academy of New Zealand Literature |access-date=18 March 2021}}</ref> He has received many notable awards including a [[Prime Minister's Award for Literary Achievement]] in 2007 and an [[Arts Foundation of New Zealand#Icon Award|Arts Foundation Icon Award]] in 2018. 

The ''Oxford Companion to New Zealand Literature'' (2006) states that he is "recognised as among the two or three finest New Zealand poets of his generation",<ref name="OCNZL">{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Jackson |first1=MacDonald P. |editor1-last=Robinson |editor1-first=Roger |editor2-last=Wattie |editor2-first=Nelson |encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to New Zealand Literature |title=Manhire, Bill |url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195583489.001.0001/acref-9780195583489-e-754 |access-date=18 March 2021 |date=2006 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-1917-3519-6 |oclc=865265749 |doi=10.1093/acref/9780195583489.001.0001}}</ref> and literary critic [[Peter Simpson (writer)|Peter Simpson]] has observed that Manhire has "probably done more to widen the audience for poetry in New Zealand than any other individual".<ref name="Simpson">{{cite news |last1=Simpson |first1=Peter |title=Bill Manhire: 121 New Zealand poems |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/embill-manhireem-121-new-zealand-poems/M6NQNANKSHA22TYPFOKIWW5VBM/ |access-date=20 March 2021 |work=New Zealand Herald |date=9 July 2005}}</ref>

==Early life==
Manhire was born in [[Invercargill]]. His mother was from Scotland with a degree in science, and his father was a publican; they had met and married during World War II, and his mother sailed to New Zealand on a ship of [[war brides]] on Valentine's Day in 1946.<ref name="Sharp">{{cite web |last1=Sharp |first1=Iain |title=An Interview with Bill Manhire |url=http://www.nzepc.auckland.ac.nz/authors/manhire/sharp.asp |website=New Zealand Electronic Poetry Centre |access-date=19 March 2021 |date=1992}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Bill Manhire |url=https://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/poet/bill-manhire/ |website=Scottish Poetry Library |access-date=5 April 2021}}</ref> In his memoir ''Under the Influence'' (2003), he described growing up in different small town South Island pubs.<ref name="Lancashire">{{cite news |last1=Lancashire |first1=Rebecca |title=The accidental poet |url=https://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/books/the-accidental-poet-20080223-ge6rcj.html |access-date=19 March 2021 |work=The Age |date=23 February 2008}}</ref> He attended [[Otago Boys' High School]], and later the [[University of Otago]] in [[Dunedin]] where he received his B.A. in 1967, his M.A. (with honours) in 1968, and his M.Litt. in 1970. He went on to study Norse [[sagas]] at [[University College London]] (1970–73, M.Phil).<ref>"Bill Manhire", ''Contemporary Poets'', 7th ed. St. James Press, 2001</ref><ref name="OCTCPE">{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Sharp |first1=Iain |editor1-last=Hamilton |editor1-first=Ian |encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to Twentieth-Century Poetry in English |title=Manhire, Bill |url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780192800428.001.0001/acref-9780192800428-e-748 |access-date=20 March 2021 |date=2003 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-1917-2758-0}}</ref> 

As a young writer, Manhire sent some poetry to [[Charles Brasch]]; of this work, Manhire later said, "I can't remember the exact contents, but I think they had lines like 'I stalk the streets of the midnight city' and were full of soiled sheets and neon and terrible things like that". He said he was "enormously encouraged" by Brasch's response, which encouraged him to keep trying and to take himself seriously as a writer. Other writers Manhire met in Dunedin included [[Iain Lonie]], [[Trevor Reeves]] and [[James K. Baxter]].<ref name="Sharp"/>

==Career==
In the 1960s, while still an undergraduate at the University of Otago, Manhire had his first poems published in New Zealand journals,<ref name="OCTCPE"/> including notably the journal ''[[Landfall (journal)|Landfall]]'', then edited by [[Robin Dudding]].<ref name="Sharp"/> While studying in London in the early 1970s he had poems published in British magazines.<ref name="OCTCPE"/> His first book was a poem, ''Malady'', published in 1970. It consisted of just four words ("malady", "melody" and "my lady") arranged in patterns on the page, accompanied by drawings by artist [[Ralph Hotere]], who had met Manhire in Dunedin while he was the [[Frances Hodgkins Fellowship|Frances Hodgkins Fellow]].<ref name="Sharp"/><ref name="OCTCPE"/> Manhire's second book, ''The Elaboration'' (1972), was also a collaboration with Hotere, and was published by [[Charles Brasch]] and [[Janet Paul]].<ref name="Sharp"/> Around this time, and while living in London, Manhire and fellow poet [[Kevin Cunningham (writer)|Kevin Cunningham]] set up the Amphedesma Press to publish their own and their friends' work, including poetry books by [[Ian Wedde]] and [[Bob Orr (poet)|Bob Orr]].<ref name="Sharp"/><ref name="Wizard">{{cite news |last1=Dudding |first1=Adam |title=Bill Manhire: Wizard of odes |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/culture/7716845/Bill-Manhire-Wizard-of-odes |access-date=20 March 2021 |work=Dominion Post |date=23 September 2012}}</ref>

In 1973, after returning to New Zealand, Manhire began lecturing in the English department of [[Victoria University of Wellington]], where he founded New Zealand's first creative writing course in 1975.<ref name="OCNZL"/><ref name="OCTCPE"/><ref name="IIML">{{cite web |title=Our history: History of the International Institute of Modern Letters |url=https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/modernletters/about/history |website=Victoria University of Wellington |access-date=20 March 2021}}</ref> His creative writing course, which he taught for more than 25 years, had a major influence on New Zealand literature, with many well-known New Zealand writers having graduated, including [[Elizabeth Knox]], [[Barbara Anderson (writer)|Barbara Anderson]] and [[Jenny Bornholdt]].<ref name="OCNZL"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Graduates online: International Institute of Modern Letters |url=https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/modernletters/our-students/grad-writing |website=Victoria University of Wellington |access-date=20 March 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Cook |first1=Megan |last2=Wilton |first2=Caren |title=Writers – Story: Arts education and training |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/arts-education-and-training/page-4 |website=Te Ara – The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |access-date=20 March 2021}}</ref> ''Mutes & Earthquakes'' (1997) was an anthology of works by his former students; the introduction by Manhire begins with two pieces of advice: "1. Write what you know, and / 2. Write what you don't know".<ref name="OCNZL"/> From 2001 to 2013 he was the inaugural and founding director of the International Institute of Modern Letters, which offers an MA and Ph.D in creative writing, as well as a range of specialised undergraduate workshops.<ref name="IIML"/> Students of the Institute have included [[Eleanor Catton]], [[Catherine Chidgey]] and [[Hinemoana Baker]]. In 2016 the Institute's building was named the Bill Manhire House in recognition of his contribution to the university and to New Zealand literature.<ref name="IIML"/> His successor [[Damien Wilkins (writer)|Damien Wilkins]] said on the occasion that Manhire's name "is synonymous with creative writing at Victoria".<ref>{{cite web |title=Bill Manhire House |url=https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/news/2016/04/bill-manhire-house |website=Victoria University of Wellington |access-date=20 March 2021 |date=26 April 2016}}</ref>

Manhire has published a number of poetry collections, including notably his ''Collected Poems'' (2001). His poetry is known for word-play, experimentation and his ironic and whimsical sense of humour.<ref name="OCNZL"/><ref name="OCTCPE"/> Critic [[Iain Sharp]] writes that Manhire's reputation "rests on a solid, seriously intentioned body of work, notable for its oblique lyricism and sense of wonder at the strangeness of both life and language".<ref name="OCTCPE"/> After his fifth book of poetry, ''Good Looks'' (1982), Manhire for a time switched to writing prose, publishing ''The Brain of Katherine Mansfield'' (1988), a book in the style of the ''[[Choose Your Own Adventure]]'' series with illustrations by [[Gregory O'Brien]], and ''The New Land'' (1990), a collection of satirical short stories.<ref name="OCTCPE"/> In 1986 he wrote a critical study of fellow New Zealand writer [[Maurice Gee]].<ref name="OCNZL"/>

In 1998, Manhire went to [[Antarctica]] for several weeks with poet [[Chris Orsman]] and painter [[Nigel Brown]], as part of the [[Artists to Antarctica]] programme run by [[Antarctica New Zealand]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Antarctic Arts Fellows under the Artists to Antarctica Programme and Invited Artists Programme|url=https://www.antarcticanz.govt.nz/uploads/images/Antarctic-Arts-Fellows-under-the-Artists-to-Antarctica-Programme-and-Invited-Artists-Programme.pdf|url-status=live|access-date=6 March 2021|website=Antarctic New Zealand}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Interview: Bill Manhire |url=https://www.flash-frontier.com/2018/12/31/interview-bill-manhire/ |website=Flash Frontier |access-date=20 March 2021 |date=31 December 2018}}</ref> The experience inspired a number of poems which formed the basis of his collection ''What to Call Your Child'' (1999), as well as a subsequent anthology of writing about Antarctica called ''The Wide White Page: Writers Imagine Antarctica'' (2004) which he edited and introduced.<ref name="Carcanet">{{cite web |title=Bill Manhire – Biography |url=https://www.carcanet.co.uk/cgi-bin/indexer?owner_id=453 |website=Carcanet Press |access-date=20 March 2021}}</ref> For the 25th anniversary of the [[Air New Zealand Flight 901|Erebus air disaster]] in 2004, Manhire wrote the poem "Erebus Voices", which was read by [[Edmund Hillary|Sir Edmund Hillary]] at the commemorative service at [[Scott Base]], [[Antarctica]].<ref>{{cite web |title='Erebus voices' |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/document/6711/erebus-voices |website=Te Ara – The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |access-date=20 March 2021}}</ref>

Throughout his career Manhire has been a significant promoter of New Zealand poetry and other local writing, acting as editor of several compilations of New Zealand works, including ''NZ Listener Short Stories'' (1977), ''Some Other Country: New Zealand's Best Short Stories'' (with his wife [[Marion McLeod]], 1984, with updated editions published in 1992, 1997 and 2007) and ''Six by Six: Short Stories by New Zealand's Best Writers'' (1989).<ref name="OCNZL"/> His collection of New Zealand poetry, ''100 New Zealand Poems'' (1993), proved particularly popular, and was subsequently expanded to become ''121 New Zealand Poems'' (2005).<ref name="Simpson"/> He was a founding publisher of the online [[Best New Zealand Poems series]], which began in 2000.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Best of Best New Zealand Poems |url=https://vup.victoria.ac.nz/the-best-of-best-new-zealand-poems/ |website=Victoria University Press |access-date=20 March 2021}}</ref> For many years he presented a poetry segment on the [[Kim Hill (broadcaster)|Kim Hill]] Show on [[Radio New Zealand]].<ref name="About">{{cite web |title=About our Founding Director |url=https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/modernletters/about/history/about-our-founding-director |website=Victoria University of Wellingon |access-date=20 March 2021}}</ref> To mark his 60th birthday in 2006, Victoria University Press and ''[[Sport (New Zealand magazine)|Sport]]'' published the limited edition ''Manhire at 60: A Book for Bill''. The book featured essays, poems, stories and other written work from over 40 writers who had been inspired by Manhire.<ref>{{cite web |title=Manhire at 60: A Book For Bill |url=https://vup.victoria.ac.nz/manhire-at-60-a-book-for-bill/ |website=Victoria University Press |access-date=5 April 2021}}</ref><ref name="Read NZ">{{cite web |title=Manhire, Bill |url=https://www.read-nz.org/writer/manhire-bill/ |website=Read NZ Te Pou Muramura |access-date=5 April 2021}}</ref>
