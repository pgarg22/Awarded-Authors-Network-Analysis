==Career==
===Writing===
She has written novels set in several different historical periods, though primarily the [[Tudor period]] and the 16th century. Reading a number of novels set in the 17th century led her to write the best-selling Lacey trilogy ''[[Wideacre]]'', which is a story about the love of land and [[incest]], ''The Favoured Child'' and ''Meridon''. This was followed by ''The Wise Woman''. ''A Respectable Trade'', a novel of the slave trade in England, set in 18th-century [[Bristol]], was adapted by Gregory for a four-part drama series for BBC television. Gregory's script was nominated for a [[BAFTA]], won an award from the Committee for Racial Equality, and the film was shown worldwide.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Two novels about a gardening family are set during the [[English Civil War]]: ''Earthly Joys'' and ''Virgin Earth'', while she has in addition written contemporary fiction – ''Perfectly Correct'', ''Mrs Hartley and the Growth Centre'', ''The Little House'' and ''Zelda's Cut''. She has also written for children.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Some of her novels have won awards and have been adapted into television dramas. The most successful of her novels has been ''[[The Other Boleyn Girl]],'' published in 2001 and adapted for BBC television in 2003 with [[Natascha McElhone]], [[Jodhi May]] and [[Jared Harris]]. In the year of its publication, ''The Other Boleyn Girl'' also won the [[Romantic Novel of the Year]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/romanticnoveloftheyear|title=Romantic novel of the year - Books|website=[[TheGuardian.com]]}}</ref> and it has subsequently spawned sequels – ''[[The Queen's Fool]],'' ''[[The Virgin's Lover]],'' ''[[The Constant Princess]],'' ''[[The Boleyn Inheritance]],'' and ''[[The Other Queen]]''. [[Miramax]] bought the film rights to ''The Other Boleyn Girl'' and released a [[The Other Boleyn Girl (2008 film)|film of the same name]] in February 2008.

Gregory has also published a series of books about the [[Plantagenets]], the ruling houses that preceded the [[Tudors]], and the [[Wars of the Roses]]. Her first book ''[[The White Queen (novel)|The White Queen]]'', published in 2009, centres on the life of [[Elizabeth Woodville]] the wife of [[Edward IV]]. ''[[The Red Queen (Gregory novel)|The Red Queen]]'', published in 2010, is about [[Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby|Margaret Beaufort]] the mother of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] and grandmother to [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. ''[[The Lady of the Rivers]]'' (2011), is the life of [[Jacquetta of Luxembourg]], mother of Elizabeth Woodville. ''[[The Kingmaker's Daughter]]'', published in 2012, is about [[Anne Neville]], the wife of [[Richard III]], and ''[[The White Princess]]'' (2013) centres on the life of [[Elizabeth of York]], wife of Henry VII and the mother of Henry VIII. The latest work is the 2017 novel ''[[The Last Tudor]]''. The 2013 [[BBC One]] television series ''[[The White Queen (TV series)|The White Queen]]'' is a 10-part adaptation of Gregory's novels ''The White Queen'', ''The Red Queen'' and ''The Kingmaker's Daughter'' (2012).<ref name="BBC White Queen">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2012/white-queen.html |title=BBC – Media Centre: ''The White Queen'', a new ten-part drama for BBC One |website=BBC.co.uk |date=31 August 2012 |access-date=6 October 2014}}</ref>

In 2013, Helen Brown of ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' wrote that "Gregory has made an impressive career out of breathing passionate, independent life into the historical noblewomen whose personalities had previously lain flat on family trees, remembered only as diplomatic currency and brood mares."<ref name="Telegraph White Princess">{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/10209224/The-White-Princess-by-Philippa-Gregory-review.html |title=''The White Princess'' by Philippa Gregory: Review |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |first=Helen|last=Brown |date=1 August 2013 |access-date=7 October 2014}}</ref> She added, "Gregory’s historical fiction has always been entertainingly speculative (those tempted to sneer should note that she’s never claimed otherwise) and comes with lashings of romantic licence."<ref name="Telegraph White Princess" />

In 2011 she contributed a short story "Why Holly Berries are as Red as Roses" to an anthology supporting [[Woodland Trust|the Woodland Trust]]. The anthology, ''Why Willows Weep'' has so far helped The Woodland Trust plant approximately 50,000 trees.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Chevalier|first1=Tracy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gaDFjwEACAAJ|title=Why Willows Weep: Contemporary Tales from the Woods|last2=Anam|first2=Tahmima|last3=Mabey|first3=Richard|last4=Billington|first4=Rachel|last5=McCann|first5=Maria|last6=Blacker|first6=Terence|last7=Morrison|first7=Blake|last8=Mosse|first8=Kate|last9=Craig|first9=Amanda|date=July 2016|publisher=IndieBooks|isbn=978-1-908041-32-6|language=en}}</ref>

====Criticism====
Gregory has said that her "commitment to historical accuracy" is a hallmark of her writing.<ref name="Gregory Bio"/> This is disputed by historians. Historian [[David Starkey]], appearing alongside Gregory in a documentary about [[Anne Boleyn]], described her work as "good [[Mills & Boon|Mills and Boon]]",<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10049866/David-Starkey-it-is-ludicrous-to-suggest-that-historical-novelists-have-authority.html|title=Serena Davies, "David Starkey: it is 'ludicrous' to suggest that historical novelists have authority|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=11 May 2013}}</ref> adding that: "We really should stop taking historical novelists seriously as historians. The idea that they have authority is ludicrous."<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10049866/David-Starkey-it-is-ludicrous-to-suggest-that-historical-novelists-have-authority.html David Starkey: it is 'ludicrous' to suggest that historical novelists have authority"], ''The Telegraph'', 11 May 2013. Accessed 12 September 2013</ref> [[Susan Bordo]] criticised Gregory's claims to historical accuracy as "self-deceptive and self-promoting chutzpah", and notes that it is not so much the many inaccuracies in her work as "Gregory's insistence on her meticulous adherence to history that most aggravates the scholars."<ref>{{cite book|last=Bordo|first=Susan|title=The Creation of Anne Boleyn: A New Look at England's Most Notorious Queen|year=2013|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|pages=226–227}}</ref>

In her novel ''[[The Other Boleyn Girl]]'', her portrayal of Henry VIII's second wife [[Anne Boleyn]] drew criticism.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/apr/30/arttheft.arts | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Thieves breach Boleyn castle defences | first=Angelique | last=Chrisafis | date=30 April 2003 | access-date=21 September 2012}}</ref><ref name="Tunzelmann">{{cite web | last = von Tunzelmann| first = Alex | title = The Other Boleyn Girl: Hollyoaks in fancy dress | work = The Guardian | date = 6 August 2008 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/aug/07/1 | access-date = 31 May 2013 }}RO</ref> The novel depicts Anne as cold and ruthless, as well as heavily implying that the accusations that she committed adultery and incest with her brother were true, despite it being widely accepted that she was innocent of the charges.<ref>Ives, E. W. (2004) ''The Life and Death of Anne Boleyn'' {{ISBN|1-4051-3463-1}}</ref> Novelist [[Robin Maxwell (author)|Robin Maxwell]] refused on principle to write a blurb for this book, describing its characterisation of Anne as "vicious, unsupportable".<ref>{{cite book|last=Bordo|first=Susan|title=The Creation of Anne Boleyn: A New Look at England's Most Notorious Queen|year=2013|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|pages=219–220}}</ref>

She is a frequent contributor to magazines and newspapers, with short stories, features and reviews. She is also a frequent broadcaster and a regular contestant on ''[[Round Britain Quiz]]'' for [[BBC Radio 4]] and the Tudor expert for [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[Time Team]]''. She won the 29 December 2008 edition of ''[[Celebrity Mastermind]]'' on BBC1, taking Elizabeth Woodville as her specialist subject.

==Philanthropy==
{{BLP sources section|date=July 2017}}
Gregory runs a small charity building wells in school gardens in [[The Gambia]].<ref>{{EW charity|1117507|Gardens for The Gambia}}</ref> Gardens for The Gambia was established in 1993 when Gregory was in The Gambia, researching for her book ''A Respectable Trade''.

Since then the charity has dug almost 200 low technology, low budget and therefore easily maintained wells, which are on-stream and providing water to irrigate school and community gardens to provide meals for the poorest children and harvest a cash crop to buy school equipment, seeds and tools.

In addition to wells, the charity has piloted a successful bee-keeping scheme, funded feeding programmes and educational workshops in batik and pottery and is working with larger donors to install mechanical boreholes in some remote areas of the country where the water table is not accessible by digging alone.

Philippa Gregory is a patron of [[The UK Chagos Support Association]],<ref name="Gregory Bio"/> which supports the [[Chagos islanders]] in their legal disputes with the British government. The people of Chagos were relocated by the British government when  the archipelago in the [[Indian Ocean]] was cleared in the 1960s and 1970s to make way for an important [[Diego Garcia#Camp Justice|U.S. airbase]]. Gregory often speaks about the Chagossians' situation and lobbies the government to take action.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Personal life==
{{BLP sources section|date=July 2017}}
Gregory wrote her first novel ''Wideacre'' while completing her doctorate<ref name="Gregory Bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.philippagregory.com/biography|title=Biography: Philippa Gregory|publisher=PhilippaGregory.com|access-date=7 July 2017}}</ref> and lived during that time in a cottage on the [[Pennine Way]] with her first husband Peter Chislett, editor of the ''[[Hartlepool Mail]]'', and their baby daughter, Victoria. They divorced before the book was published.

Following the success of ''Wideacre'' and the publication of ''The Favoured Child'', she moved south to near [[Midhurst]], West Sussex, where the ''Wideacre'' trilogy was set. Here Gregory married Paul Carter, her second husband there, with whom she has a son, named Adam. She divorced for a second time.

After the break-up of her second marriage, she met and married Anthony Mason, whom she had first met during her time in [[Hartlepool]].

Gregory now lives on a {{convert|100|acre|km2|adj=on}} farm in the [[North York Moors National Park]], with her husband, children and stepchildren (six in all). Her interests include riding, walking, skiing, and gardening.
