'''Franz Xaver Kroetz''' ({{IPA-de|fʁant͡s ˈksaː.vɐ kʁœt͡s|lang|De-Franz Xaver Kroetz.ogg}}; born 25 February 1946 in [[Munich]]) is a [[List of German-language authors|German author]], playwright,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://theater.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=9F0CE3DF1538F933A05751C1A964948260|title=THE STAGE: MONODRAMA BY KROETZ|last=Gussow|first=Mel|date=30 December 1982|work=New York Times |access-date=4 March 2011}}</ref> actor<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bild.de/BILD/regional/muenchen/leute/2011/02/25/franz-xaver-kroetz/65-baby-schimmerlos-ist-ab-heute-rentner.html|title=Schauspieler und Autor Franz Xaver Kroetz feiert auf Teneriffa seinen 65.|last=Ranft|first=Wolfgang|date=25 February 2011|work=[[Bild]]|language=de|access-date=4 March 2011}}</ref> and film director. He achieved great success beginning in the early 1970s. ''Persistent'', ''[[Stallerhof|Farmyard]]'', and ''Request Concert'', all written in 1971, are some of the works conventionally associated with Kroetz.

Kroetz is part of a generation of playwrights who modified the critical folk-piece, emphasizing in his works of the early 1970s the underside of West Germany's affluence through [[realism (theatre)|realistic]] portrayals of the lives of the poor. He later began writing for television, which led to a wider audience. His more analytical, [[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]]-influenced plays were generally not well-received, though ''Upper Austria'' (1972) and ''The Nest'' (1974) achieved critical and commercial success. Some later works of [[social realism]] like ''Through the Leaves'' (1976) and ''Tom Fool'' (1978) are also highly regarded.

Kroetz's plays have been translated and performed internationally. [[Simon Stephens]] argued in 2016, "Kroetz was identifying how poverty can give rise to brutality, to cynicism, despair and fear. His plays are as resonant now as they’ve ever been."<ref name="FT" />

==Life==
Kroetz did poorly in high school. He attended an acting school in Munich and the [[Max-Reinhardt-Seminar]] in Vienna. He worked as a day-laborer. In the late 1960s, when he was unable to enter mainstream theater, he was active in the alternative theater scene in Munich, and also wrote and acted in works of the ''Bauerntheater'' (peasant [[Farce|farces]] with figures who act out stock situations).<ref name=McGowan1996>{{Cite journal|last=McGowan|first=Moray|date=1996|title="Die Stadt ist der Metzger": The Crisis of Bavarian Peasant Identity in Franz Xaver Kroetz's "Bauern sterben"|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1431711|journal=German Studies Review|volume=19|issue=1|pages=29–40|doi=10.2307/1431711|issn=0149-7952}}</ref> He became a member of the German Communist Party ([[German Communist Party|DKP]]) in 1972,<ref name=McGowan1996/> leaving in May 1980<ref name=Cocalis>{{Cite journal|last=COCALIS|first=SUSAN L.|date=1981|title=‹MITLEID› AND ‹ENGAGEMENT›: Compassion and/or Political Commitment in the Dramatic Works of Franz Xaver Kroetz|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/23979776|journal=Colloquia Germanica|volume=14|issue=3|pages=203–219|issn=0010-1338}}</ref> when it had negligible political influence in West Germany.<ref name=Hoffmeister>{{Cite journal|last=Kroetz|first=Franz Xaver|last2=Hoffmeister|first2=Donna L.|date=1980|title="Ich kann nur schreiben, von dem, was ich sehe, nicht von dem, was ich sehen möchte."

He was affiliated with [[Suhrkamp-Verlag]] until 1974, with his radical politics being problematic for the publisher. Kroetz admitted in a 1978 interview to being a somewhat combative person.<ref name=Hoffmeister/> Michael Toteborg wrote in 1978 that the best-known of the early plays are ''Wildwechsel'' (''Game Crossing'' or ''Jailbait'', 1968), ''Mannersache'' (''Men's Business'', 1970), and ''Farmyard''. He said that in ''Munich Child'' "Kroetz [gives] a convincing political dimension to the private experiences of his characters."<ref name="Toteborg">{{Cite journal|last=Toteborg|first=Michael|last2=Denlinger|first2=Ardon|date=1978|title=Franz Xaver Kroetz: The Realistic Folkplay|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3245359|journal=Performing Arts Journal|volume=2|issue=3|pages=17–25|doi=10.2307/3245359|issn=0735-8393}}</ref> His plays in the 1970s portrayed people who had been rendered speechless by their own social misery. He has named [[Marieluise Fleißer]] as a major influence on his early writing,<ref name="Hoffmeister" /> as well as [[Ödön von Horváth]]. He became famous when in 1971 the premiere of his plays ''Heimarbeit'' (translated as "House-work" or "Houseworker") and ''Hartnäckig'' (''Persistent'') were disrupted by [[neo-fascism|neo-fascists]].<ref name="MarkBrown">{{Cite web|last=Brown|first=Mark|date=2007-03-17|title=Tom Fool captures the dynamics of life under capitalism|url=https://socialistworker.co.uk/art/10701/Tom%20Fool%20captures%20the%20dynamics%20of%20life%20under%20capitalism|url-status=live|access-date=2021-06-10|website=Socialist Worker (Britain)}}</ref> ''Houseworker'' caused controversy for containing explicit scenes.<ref name="FT">{{Cite news|last=Trueman|first=Matt|date=2016-10-24|title=Franz Xaver Kroetz: tales of everyday earthquakes|url=https://www.ft.com/content/1d50d3a4-95e7-11e6-a1dc-bdf38d484582|url-status=live|access-date=2021-05-15|newspaper=Financial Times}}</ref>

His later plays contain less violence and sexuality, and are more influenced by [[Bertolt Brecht]].<ref name=Cocalis/> ''Oberösterreich'' (''Upper Austria'', 1972) and ''Das Nest'' (''The Nest'', 1974) garnered popular and critical acclaim.<ref name="Cocalis" /> The former marked a shift from portraying (in Kroetz's words) the "milieu of the extreme" to portraying average people who lack pent-up frutrations and communicate more effectively. Donna L. Hoffmeister wrote that the work "was presented, according to my count, by forty different theaters between 1974 and 1976 and the play Das Nest (1974) by about twenty theaters in the 1976/77 season".<ref name="Hoffmeister" /> In ''The Nest'', the protagonist is a truck driver. His boss orders him to dump toxic waste into a lake, thus soiling his "nest."

After the early plays, he tried writing works for television because he wanted to reach a wider audience, and his move to TV had this effect, with ''Maria Magdalena'' viewed by five to 15 million. The contemporary television fare cautioned through comedy against activism by workers, and Kroetz wished to refunction televisual ''Volkstheater'' for progressive aims. His works for television have been described as "metacritiques of the television industry" that thematize its detrimental impact on viewers.<ref name="Decker">{{Cite journal|last=Decker|first=Craig|date=1991|title="... und den Kasten zusammenhauen": Televisual Questions and the Dramas of Franz Xaver Kroetz|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/407302|journal=The German Quarterly|volume=64|issue=1|pages=25–32|doi=10.2307/407302|issn=0016-8831}}</ref> ''Das Nest'' was first produced for television in 1976, and aired in West Germany in 1979. ''Upper Austria'' was first broadcast in 1973.<ref name="Decker" /> The broadcaster ZDF postponed ''Upper Austria'' for months due to its politics. Kroetz moved into social realism with ''Through the Leaves'' (1976) and ''Tom Fool'' (1978),<ref name="FT" /> the latter of which was a success. He considers ''Upper Austria'', ''The Nest'', and ''Tom Fool'' to form a [[trilogy]].<ref name=Kreuzer>{{Cite journal|last=Kreuzer|first=Helmut|date=1981|title=Review of Franz Xaver Kroetz.

He wrote a [[libretto]] based on his play ''[[Stallerhof]]'' (1971) for an opera of the same name which [[Gerd Kühr]] composed in 1987/88. It was premiered at the first [[Munich Biennale]] in 1988. The play was staged at the [[Burgtheater]] in 2010 by David Bösch.<ref>Georg Petermichl: [http://www.nachtkritik.de/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=5022&catid=80 Fantasievolle Pirouetten] nachtkritik.de 10 December 2010 {{in lang|de}}</ref>

In her book ''Franz Xaver Kroetz: The Construction of a Political Aesthetic'', Michelle Mattson of the [[Columbia University]] summarizes:<ref name=Mattson>{{Cite book|last=Mattson|first=Michelle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P_izAAAAIAAJ&newbks=0&printsec=frontcover&dq=franz+xaver+kroetz&q=franz+xaver+kroetz&hl=en|title=Franz Xaver Kroetz: The Construction of a Political Aesthetic|date=1996-07-01|publisher=Berg Publishers|isbn=978-1-85973-079-9|language=en}}</ref> <blockquote>Franz Xaver Kroetz – banana-cutter, hospital orderly, fledgling actor and, more significantly, Germany's most popular contemporary dramatist of the seventies and early eighties. This study, which situates Kroetz's aesthetics in a political context, focuses on four plays that mark crisis points in his development of a political aesthetic.</blockquote>

Kroetz wrote for the television series [[Tatort]], ''Spiel mit Karten'' in 1980 and ''Wolf im Schafspelz'' in 2002. He is also known for his role as the gossip columnist 'Baby' Schimmerlos (roughly 'Baby Clueless') in the television series ''[[Kir Royal – Aus dem Leben eines Klatschreporters|Kir Royal]]''. His income from acting made writing without financial worries possible.<ref name="Merkur">Michael Schleicher: [http://www.merkur-online.de/nachrichten/kultur/franz-xaver-kroetz-altern-massaker-1134807.html Franz Xaver Kroetz: "Altern ist ein Massaker"] Interview, [[Münchner Merkur]] 22 February 2011 {{in lang|de}}</ref>

From 1992 to 2005, Kroetz was married to the actress [[Marie-Theres Relin]]. They have three children. As of 2011, Kroetz lived in the [[Chiemgau]] and on [[Tenerife]].<ref name="Merkur" />

Some of Kroetz's plays have also been translated into French and performed in France.<ref name="Merkur" />

==Style==
According to Holmberg, critics "refer to Mr. Kroetz's plays as constituting a drama of the inarticulate. The hallmark of his style is to draw characters unable to find the half-word they need to express sorrow or rage."<ref name=Holmberg/> The early plays of Kroetz also end violently. Mel Gussow describes Kroetz as reliant on words rather than images, and quotes the playwright as having been disturbed by the "garrulity" of most theater of the same time.<ref name="Gussow">{{Cite news|last=Gussow|first=Mel|date=1981-03-17|title=THEATER: 'REQUEST CONCERT,' A WOMAN ALONE, AT INTERART|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/17/theater/theater-request-concert-a-woman-alone-at-interart.html|access-date=2021-06-09|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Kroetz has also argued, "A dramatist must be tough on his characters. Sentimentality is a trap, and it's tempting because audiences love sentimental plays."<ref name="Holmberg" /> The extreme naturalism of ''Request Concert'' has led to retrospective comparisons of it with [[Chantal Akerman]]'s film ''[[Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles]]'' (1975),<ref name="Vincentelli">{{Cite news|last=Vincentelli|first=Elisabeth|date=2016-10-27|title=Review: ‘Request Concert,’ an Eleanor Rigby, at Least in Spirit|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/28/theater/request-concert-review.html|access-date=2021-06-09|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> and also with [[Marsha Norman]]'s ''[['night, Mother]]'' (1983).<ref name=PDYoung>{{Cite web|last=Young|first=Paul David|date=2016-11-05|title=Home Alone, With a Few Pills: Franz Xaver Kroetz's 'Request Concert'|url=https://hyperallergic.com/335523/home-alone-with-a-few-pills-franz-xaver-kroetzs-request-concert/|access-date=2021-06-09|website=Hyperallergic|language=en-US}}</ref> Gautam Dasgupta has compared him to [[David Storey]] and [[Rainer W.

Susan L. Cocalis writes that early on Kroetz does not give readers a way to "locate the events on stage in a hypothetical framework and thus gain some distance to the action. He does not even bother to supply any discernible criteria for identifying the good and the evil, for in these plays a just order of the universe [...] simply does not exist." She also sees Kroetz as implying that the material interests of the family unit determine the code of [[normativity|normative]] sexuality.<ref name=Cocalis/>

These plays have been described as impacting audiences primarily through compassion, and after 1972 he moved to a more analytical form of political drama about broader economic issues. Kroetz has referred to the early works as "descriptive realism" and the later works as "analytic realism" or "engaged realism". ''Sterntaler'' and ''Heimat'' include film clips of workplaces, and socially critical songs by workers.<ref name=Cocalis/> According to Craig Decker, Kroetz in his television works dramatizes how TV can constrain viewer consciousness; the playwright hopes to create people who break away from commercial culture and act as citizens rather than consumers.<ref name="Decker" /> Gérard Thiériot divided his mainstream work into three phases: up to 1972, 1972-1980, and 1980 onward. ''The Nest'' has been called a [[morality play]], and different from most of the works in the second phase.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McGowan|first=Moray|date=1989|title=Review of Franz Xaver Kroetz et le nouveau théâtre populaire, Gérard Thiériot|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3732529|journal=The Modern Language Review|volume=84|issue=3|pages=809–810|doi=10.2307/3732529|issn=0026-7937}}</ref> Rolf-Peter Carl, in ''Franz Xaver Kroetz'' (1978), divides his works into those before 1972, an "experimental" phase (1972–73), and those since 1974.<ref name=Kreuzer/>

In a 1996 article about ''Bauern sterben'' (1985), Moray McGowan wrote that Bavaria's Catholicism, obstinate conservatism and distrust of modernization were emphasized as elements of Kroetz's work in the early 1970s, but that the contribution of his Bavarian identity to certain tensions in his work later became ignored.<ref name=McGowan1996/>

== Reception ==

=== Early works ===
Michael Toteborg wrote that while Kroetz writes controversial content for serious purposes and "never wanted to [[Class discrimination|raise himself above the characters interacting on the stage]] [...] the question concerning the aesthetic and political worth of Kroetz's dramatic productions is debatable".<ref name="Toteborg" /> Carl accused the playwright of theoretical banalities but also defends the earlier works against the playwright's later indictments. He praised ''[[Stallerhof|Farmyard]] ''as capable of stirring audiences to social involvement, but criticized ''Men's Business'' for its ending and ''Munich Child'' for its "demagogy".<ref name="Kreuzer" /> Henry J. Schmidt, reviewing Carl's book on Kroetz, criticized Carl for discussing the political effectiveness of ''Men's Business'' without recourse to audience response, however, and described the ending of ''Men's Business'' as "one of Kroetz's most effective scenes".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=Henry J.|date=1980|title=Review of Franz Xaver Kroetz|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2906730|journal=MLN|volume=95|issue=3|pages=746|doi=10.2307/2906730|issn=0026-7910|via=JSTOR}}</ref>

In a review of ''Farmyard and Four Plays'' (which contains ''Farmyard'', ''Request Concert'', ''Michi's Blood'', ''Men's Business'', and the ''Men's Business'' revision ''A Man, A Dictionary''<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kroetz|first=Franz Xaver|url=https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/657055|title=Farmyard, & four other plays|date=1976|publisher=Urizen Books : [distributed by E. P. Dutton]|isbn=978-0-916354-12-1|location=New York}}</ref>), Dasgupta billed the playwright's works as "lyrical, scathing, humane dramas".<ref name=Dasgupta/> Jeanette R.

=== ''Request Concert'' (1971) ===
[[Mel Gussow]] reviewed ''Request Concert'' positively in 1981, saying that because of the "clearsighted dramatic vision of Mr. Kroetz [...] the mundane is transformed into something close to hypnotic. [...] Through an accumulation of details and objects, we arrive at a point of complete empathy with the woman".<ref name=Gussow/> In a 1986 performance starring Salome Jens, Dan Sullivan of ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that "one becomes absorbed in the woman’s little tasks and the meticulous way she goes about them. [...] Kroetz may not have meant to leave a loophole [with the ending], but it only enriches his play."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Sullivan|first=Dan|date=1986-01-08|title=STAGE REVIEW : A DRAMA FROM THE SOUL IN 'REQUEST CONCERT'|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-01-08-ca-759-story.html|url-status=live|access-date=2021-06-09|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US}}</ref> [[Katie Mitchell]] has called it a "difficult, beautiful play".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Connolly|first=Kate|date=2009-05-08|title=Berlin blues: Katie Mitchell makes her German debut|url=http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/may/08/katie-mitchell-wunschkonzert-berlin|url-status=live|access-date=2021-06-09|website=The Guardian|language=en}}</ref> A writer noted in [[The Herald (Glasgow)|''The Herald'']] that in 2011 the play continued to enjoy a level of attention uncommon for works by German writers of Kroetz's generation.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2011-08-10|title=Intimate, silent slice of a lonely life cut short|url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/life_style/arts_ents/13033875.intimate-silent-slice-lonely-life-cut-short/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-06-09|newspaper=The Herald|language=en}}</ref>

Reviewing a 2016 [[Brooklyn Academy of Music|BAM Fisher]] performance, [[Elisabeth Vincentelli]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said ''Request Concert'' (partly because of Danuta Stenka's performance) remains a work of "heart-wrenching power [...] Partly this has to do with the resilience of loneliness and boredom in our lives, despite our access to so-called social media."<ref name="Vincentelli" /> Reviewing the same performance, Paul David Young wrote, "Though she does not vocalize, Frau Rasch speaks on behalf of those voiceless souls in contemporary society who feel lost, purposeless, alone and unconnected. It is a political and very human voice."<ref name="PDYoung" /> In a chapter of ''The Schaubühne Berlin under Thomas Ostermeier'', [[Marvin Carlson]] referred to it as "powerful".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Carlson|first=Marvin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oVAEEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA60|title=The Schaubühne Berlin under Thomas Ostermeier: Reinventing Realism|date=2020-11-12|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-350-16582-3|editor-last=Boenisch|editor-first=Peter M.|pages=60|language=en|chapter=Socialist Realism, Capitalist Realism, Ostermeier Realism}}</ref>

=== Brecht-influenced works ===
Cocalis claimed that by 1972 Kroetz had drawn some criticism for being too repetitive or too apolitical. Works like ''Lienz – Gateway to the Dolomites'' (1972), ''Maria Magdalena'' (1972), ''Sterntaler ''(1974), ''Heimat ''(1975), and ''Agnes Bernauer'' (1976) were neither critically nor commercially successful. In ''Maria Magdalena'' Kroetz in her view struggles with his own formal idiom, and the Brechtian elements of ''Sterntaler'' and ''Heimat'' make them less powerful than previous works, akin to melodrama or soap opera. Critics of ''Agnes Bernauer'' found the heroine unconvincing and the socio-economics oversimplified.<ref name=Cocalis/>

=== ''The Nest'' (1974) ===
''[[The Guardian]]''<nowiki/>'s Susannah Clapp expressed a lukewarm view of ''The Nest'', describing some scenes as moving but arguing, "There is uplift at the end but the unremitting intensity takes its toll on the pace. Detail is a double-edged sword. Some of the most striking episodes stretch the patience most: there is a long sequence when a suicide attempt gradually turns to farce."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Clapp|first=Susannah|date=2016-11-06|title=The Nest review – an unflinching tale of poverty|url=http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/nov/06/the-nest-young-vic-london-review-franz-xaver-kroetz-pj-harvey|url-status=live|access-date=2021-06-09|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en}}</ref> In a 2001 review of [[Alexander Gelman]]'s ''A Man with Connections'', about a man who is viewed by his wife as responsible for an industrial accident that harmed their son, [[Lyn Gardner]] argued that Kroetz handles a similar scenario better in ''The Nest''.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Gardner|first=Lyn|date=2001-01-13|title=Theatre: A Man with Connections|url=http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2001/jan/13/theatre.artsfeatures|url-status=live|access-date=2021-06-10|website=The Guardian|language=en}}</ref> In 2016, however, she said ''The Nest'' has didactic impulses and "now looks a little simplistic and old-fashioned" despite a topical environmental message.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Gardner|first=Lyn|date=2016-11-01|title=The Nest review – Conor McPherson gives 70s fable a fresh coat of despair|url=http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/nov/01/the-nest-review-franz-xaver-kroetz-conor-mcpherson|url-status=live|access-date=2021-06-09|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en}}</ref>

=== ''Through the Leaves'' (1976) ===
Barry V. Daniels lauded ''Through the Leaves'' as thematically "far beyond the specific naturalism of Antoine. When the generally middle class, educated audience confronts the essential matter of the play – its profound humanness – the barrier between them and the lower class characters breaks down".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Daniels|first=Barry V.|date=1984|title=Review of Through the Leaves|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3206747|journal=Theatre Journal|volume=36|issue=4|pages=537|doi=10.2307/3206747|issn=0192-2882|via=JSTOR}}</ref> Reviewing a 1987 performance of ''Through the Leaves'' at the Dallas Theater Center, Jeannie M. Woods praised the play's psychological insight, calling it "a profoundly disturbing play [...] Her Pollyanna attitude seems to flourish on Otto's abuse and on his inability to express his affection. [...] The harsh reality is tempered both by the warmth of Martha and by grotesque comedy."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Woods|first=Jeannie M.|date=1988|title=Review of Through the Leaves|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3207662|journal=Theatre Journal|volume=40|issue=2|pages=263–264|doi=10.2307/3207662|issn=0192-2882|via=JSTOR}}</ref> Frank Rich of ''The New York Times'' wrote in 1984 that the play "is not pleasant, but it sticks like a splinter in the mind." He said that even certain impediments of the production he had attended (like Downey's English translation being relocated in Queens) did not "mute the jarring strains of [Kroetz's] genuinely disturbing theatrical voice."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Rich|first=Frank|date=1984-04-06|title=STAGE: 'THROUGH THE LEAVES'|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/06/theater/stage-through-the-leaves.html|access-date=2021-06-10|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

In 2003, ''The Guardian''{{'}}s Michael Billington gave a Southwark Playhouse performance four out of five stars and wrote, "What makes Kroetz an exceptional dramatist is that he links behaviour to economics." He also argued, "Without a hint of patronage or condescension, Kroetz shows how both characters are victims of circumstance."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Billington|first=Michael|date=2003-01-11|title=Through the Leaves, Southwark Playhouse, London|url=http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2003/jan/11/theatre.artsfeatures1|url-status=live|access-date=2021-06-10|website=The Guardian|language=en}}</ref> Gardner called it "a gripping but gruelling dissection of a relationship that flounders on mismatched desire, conditioned responses and the utter failure of language [...] one of his best plays".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Gardner|first=Lyn|last2=Cook|first2=Mark|date=2009-11-14|title=This week's theatre previews|url=http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/nov/14/theatre-previews-through-the-leaves|url-status=live|access-date=2021-06-10|website=The Guardian|language=en}}</ref>

=== ''Tom Fool'' (1978) ===
Mark Brown praised the playwright as understanding the 'double burden' of class and gender carried by working class women, and added that "arguably his best writing is reserved for Otto’s solitary musings on his position [...] The great beauty of ''Tom Fool'' is that it manages to address the politics of capitalism without a hint of polemic. Kroetz relies upon the emotional dynamics and powerful poetry that are the hallmark of great theatre".<ref name=MarkBrown/> ''The Guardian''<nowiki/>'s Mark Fisher gave a 2006 performance three out of five stars, praising the performances but arguing, "By showing not only the explosions but also the mundane business of clearing up, the play has a fragmented rhythm".<ref>{{Cite news|date=2006-11-07|title=Tom Fool, Citizens, Glasgow|url=http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2006/nov/07/theatre2|access-date=2021-06-10|newspaper=the Guardian|language=en}}</ref> Gardner gave a positive review to a 2007 performance, arguing that Kroetz is able to make mundane events "hypnotic"; she claimed that the majority of the play is "like watching an unstable building sway and fall in agonising slow motion."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Gardner|first=Lyn|date=2007-04-04|title=Theatre review: Tom Fool / Bush, London|url=http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2007/apr/04/theatre|url-status=live|access-date=2021-06-09|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en}}</ref> ''Tom Fool'' was described as "superb" in ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|title=There's more Brecht than Bouncers in the plays of John Godber|language=en|newspaper=The Herald|url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/life_style/arts_ents/13095510.brecht-bouncers-plays-john-godber/|access-date=2021-06-09}}</ref>

=== 1980s and beyond ===
According to Dominic Dromgoole, Kroetz was for some "the guiding light of the 1980s. For others, he was the most mind-bogglingly boring playwright history had ever thrown up."<ref name=FT/> Arthur Holmberg of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote in 1984 that "literary critics rank him as one of the most important of Europe's young playwrights."<ref name=Holmberg>{{Cite news|last=Holmberg|first=Arthur|date=1984-10-07|title=HIS PLAYS SEEK 'THE REALITY OF THE MIND'|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/07/arts/his-plays-seek-the-reality-of-the-mind.html|access-date=2021-06-09|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>
