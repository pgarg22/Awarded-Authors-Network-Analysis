'''Pier Giorgio Di Cicco''' (July 5, 1949 - December 22, 2019) was an [[Italy|Italian]]-[[Canadians|Canadian]] [[poet]].<ref>[[Jacob Scheier]], [https://nowtoronto.com/news/in-memoriam-pier-giorgio-di-cicco/ "In memoriam: Pier Giorgio Di Cicco, 1949-2019"]. ''[[Now (newspaper)|Now]]'', January 1, 2020.</ref> In 2005 he became the second [[Poet Laureate of Toronto]].

Born in [[Arezzo]], [[Italy]], his family immigrated to Canada in 1952. Di Cicco was brought up in several [[North America]]n cities, among them [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], Montreal, Quebec and [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]. In the early 1970s he attended the [[University of Toronto]].  While working part-time as a bartender at the university, he began to publish poems in little magazines. He has since written 13 books of poetry and in 1978 edited a volume of verse by Italian-Canadian poets, ''Roman Candles'' which became a seminal volume for the birth of Italian-Canadian literature.

His poems, consisting of deep images in [[stanza]]s of free verse -  with lines consisting of irregular numbers of [[syllable]]s and (hypothetical) feet - often referred to di Cicco's immigrant and Italian-family experiences. In books like ''Flying Deeper Into the Century'' (1982) and ''The Tough Romance'' (1979) he communicated a modern, sensitive awareness of the  confusing welter of 20th-century life. Di Cicco's unmetrical but imagistic lines flowed on, often with cumulative power, to release their tension at the end of their stanzas.

Di Cicco gradually felt called to a [[Catholic]] religious life. Reducing his output of verse, he spent a period in an [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] [[monastery]] north of Toronto. Di Cicco then undertook religious studies and became a friar with a parish in [[Brampton]], Ontario. In the 1990s he resumed writing and publishing poems, producing a selected volume and several others. In 2005, he was chosen Poet Laureate of Toronto; he published a poem weekly in ''[[The Toronto Star]]'' Sunday newspaper. In 2004-5 he taught at the University of Toronto. The writer and critic Joseph Pivato edited, ''Pier Giorgio Di Cicco: Essays on His Works'' (2011), an important analysis of his poetry.

His latest book (2018) is entitled ''Wishipedia''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Di Cicco |first1=Pier Giorgio |title=Wishipedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mF5LtAEACAAJ |publisher=Mansfield Press |accessdate=12 June 2018 |language=en |date=May 2018|isbn=9781771261722 }}</ref>
