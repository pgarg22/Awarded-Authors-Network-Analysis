'''Tytus Czyżewski''' (28 December 1880 in [[Przyszowa]] – 5 May 1945 in [[Kraków]]) was a [[Poland|Polish]] painter, art theoretician, [[Futurism (art)|Futurist]] [[poet]], [[playwright]], member of the Polish Formists, and [[Colorist]].

==Biography==
In 1902 he studied at the [[Academy of Fine Arts in Krakow]] in the painting studios of [[Józef Mehoffer]] and [[Leon Wyczółkowski]]. Czyżewski travelled to [[Paris]] and learned from the artistic trends there. He began exhibiting in 1906. Czyżewski painting style was highly influenced by [[Cézanne]] and [[El Greco]], whose work he admired until his death.

In 1917, with the brothers [[Zbigniew Pronaszko|Zbigniew]] and [[Andrzej Pronaszko]], he organized in Kraków an exhibition of Polish Expressionist works. The group later became known as the ''Polish Formists''. Until the break-up of the Formists in 1922, he was the primary artist and theoretician behind the movement as well as the joint editor of the periodical ''Formiści''. He was also co-founder of the Polish Futurist clubs, and published Futurist-inspired "visual poetry." Czyżewski brief flirted with [[Surrealism]] and spent the rest of his life as a [[Colorist]].
