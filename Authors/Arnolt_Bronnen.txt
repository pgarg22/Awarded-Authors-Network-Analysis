'''Arnolt Bronnen''' (19 August 1895 – 12 October 1959) was an [[Austria]]n [[playwright]] and [[Theatre director|director]].

==Life and career==
Bronnen was born in [[Vienna]], Austria. The son of the Austrian-Jewish writer [[Ferdinand Bronner]] and his Christian wife Martha Bronner.<ref>''The Menorah Journal'' 19 (1930) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZpUWAQAAIAAJ&q=%22Arnolt+Bronnen%22+jewish+father&dq=%22Arnolt+Bronnen%22+jewish+father&hl=en&redir_esc=y 170].</ref> Bronnen's most famous play is the [[Expressionism (theatre)|Expressionist]] drama ''[[Parricide (play)|Parricide]]'' (''Vatermord'', 1922); its première production is notable, among other things, for being that from which Bronnen's friend, the young [[Bertolt Brecht]] in an early stage of his directing career, withdrew, after being taken to hospital with malnutrition and the actors of the cast, led by [[Heinrich George]], walked out on him.<ref name="willett">Willett and Manheim (1970, viii) and Thomson (1994, 26).</ref> According to ''The Cambridge Guide to Theatre'', the "erotic, anti-[[bourgeois]], black expressionism" of the play "caused a sensation" when it was eventually performed.

Bronnen also wrote ''[[Birth of Youth]]'' (''Geburt der Jugend'', 1922) and ''[[Die Excesse]]'' (1923).<ref name="cgt">Banham (1998, 132).</ref> After having collaborated on film treatments and various theatrical projects together, in 1923 Bronnen and Brecht co-directed a condensed version of ''Pastor Ephraim Magnus'' (a [[Nihilism|nihilistic]], Expressionist play, according to ''The Cambridge Guide'', "stuffed with [[Perversion|perversities]] and [[Sadism and masochism|sado-masochistic]] [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]]") by [[Hans Henny Jahnn]].<ref name="cgtsacks">Banham (1998, 553), Sacks (1994, xviii), and Willett and Manheim (1970, viii).</ref> Later in his life he wrote [[reportage plays]].<ref name="cgt"/>

Bronnen signed the [[Gelöbnis treuester Gefolgschaft]], a "vow of most faithful allegiance" to [[Adolf Hitler]] in 1933,<ref name=letters>[https://books.google.com/books?id=7iC7BGIcvTQC&pg=PA367 88 "writers"], from ''Letters of Heinrich and Thomas Mann, 1900-1949'', Weimar and Now: German Cultural Criticism 12, University of California Press 1998, {{ISBN|0-520-07278-2}}, pp.&nbsp;367&ndash;68.</ref> and was program director for the public TV station [[Fernsehsender Paul Nipkow]], but after the [[Second World War]] he became a [[communist]].<ref name="cgt" />

Bronnen died of heart failure in [[East Berlin]] and is buried in the [[Dorotheenstadt cemetery]].<ref>Taylor (1980, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=vuiIUZKUCeOziQLv34G4BQ&id=wHUaAAAAYAAJ&dq=Taylor%2C+Literature+and+Society+in+Germany&q=alongside+Heinrich+Mann#search_anchor 65]).</ref>
