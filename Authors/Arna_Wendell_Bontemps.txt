==Early life==
Bontemps was born in [[Alexandria, Louisiana]], into a [[Louisiana Creole]] family. His ancestors included free people of color and French colonists. His father was a contractor and sometimes would take his son to construction sites. As the boy got older, his father would take him along to  speak-easies at night that featured [[jazz]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Arna Bontemps facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about Arna Bontemps|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/people/literature-and-arts/american-literature-biographies/arna-bontemps|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en}}</ref> His mother, Maria Carolina Pembroke, was a schoolteacher.<ref Name="Fleming">Robert E.

When Bontemps was three years old, his family moved to [[Los Angeles, California]] in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] of blacks out of the [[Southern United States|South]] and into cities of the North, [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and West. They settled in what became known as the [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]] district. After attending public schools, Bontemps attended [[Pacific Union College]] in [[Angwin, California|Angwin]], California, where he graduated in 1923. He majored in English and minored in history, and he was also a member of the [[Omega Psi Phi]] fraternity.

==Career==
Following his graduation, Bontemps met and befriended the author [[Wallace Thurman]], of  ''[[Fire!!]]'' magazine in his job at Los Angeles Post Office. Bontemps later traveled to [[New York City]], where he settled and became part of the Harlem Renaissance.

In August 1924, at the age of 22, Bontemps published his first poem, "Hope" (originally called "A Record of the Darker Races"), in ''[[The Crisis]]'', official magazine of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).<ref>Original publication is not part of the digitized archival available on Google Books. However, it is credited in the reprint edition: [https://books.google.com/books?id=zkIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA25&dq=%22Hope%22+by+Arna+Bontemps&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiX8PW1u4jaAhUI2oMKHQaNAxIQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=%22Hope%22%20by%20Arna%20Bontemps&f=false "Hope"], ''The Crisis'', September–October 2002, p. 25.</ref> He depicted hope as an "empty bark"<ref>{{cite web|title=Arna Bontemps Museum|url=https://cenlamar.com/2010/07/27/arna-bontemps-museum/|website=CenLamar|date=28 July 2010}}</ref> drifting meaninglessly with no purpose, referring to his confusion about his career. Bontemps, along with many other West Coast intellectuals, traveled to [[New York City|New York]] during the [[Harlem Renaissance]].<ref Name="Fleming"/>

After graduation, he moved to New York in 1924 to teach at the [[Harlem Academy]] (present-day Northeastern Academy) in New York City. While he was teaching, Bontemps continued to publish poetry. In both 1926 and 1927, he received the Alexander Pushkin Prize of ''[[Opportunity: A Journal of Negro Life|Opportunity]]'', an academic journal published by the [[National Urban League]]. In 1926 he won the ''Crisis'' Poetry Prize.<ref Name="Fleming"/>

In New York, Bontemps met other writers who became lifelong friends, including [[Countee Cullen]], [[Langston Hughes]], [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], [[Zora Neale Hurston]], [[James Weldon Johnson]], [[Claude McKay]] and [[Jean Toomer]].<ref Name="Fleming"/> [[Langston Hughes|Hughes]] became a role model, collaborator, and dear friend to Bontemps.<ref>Jones, Jacqueline C. "Arna Bontemps," in Emmanuel S. Nelson (ed.), ''African American Authors, 1745–1945: A Bio-Bibliographical Critical Sourcebook'', Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2000, pp. 36–43.</ref>

In 1926 Bontemps married [[Alberta Johnson]], with whom he had six children. From oldest to youngest they are: Joan, Paul, Poppy, Camille, Connie and Alex. In 1931, he left New York and his teaching position at the [[Harlem Academy]] as the [[Depression era|Great Depression]] deepened. He and his family moved to [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]], [[Alabama]], where he had a teaching position at the Oakwood Junior College for three years.<ref Name="Fleming"/>

In the early 1930s, Bontemps began to publish fiction, in addition to more poetry.<ref Name="Fleming"/> He received a considerable amount of attention for his first novel, ''God Sends Sunday'' (1931). This novel explored the story of an African-American jockey named Little Augie who easily earns money and carelessly squanders it. Little Augie ends up wandering through the black sporting world when his luck as a jockey eventually runs out. Bontemps was praised for his poetic style, his re-creation of the black language and his distinguishing characters throughout this novel. However, despite the abundant amount of praise, [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] viewed it as "sordid" and equated it with other "decadent" novels of the Harlem Renaissance. Later in his career, Bontemps collaborated with [[Countee Cullen]] to create a dramatic adaption of the novel. Together in 1946 they published this adaption as ''[[St. Louis Woman]]''.<ref Name="Fleming"/>

Bontemps also began to write several children's books. In 1932, he collaborated with [[Langston Hughes]] and wrote ''Popo and Fifina''. This story followed the lives of siblings Popo and Fifina, in an easy to understand introduction to [[Haitian people|Haitian]] life for children. Bontemps continued writing children's novels and published ''You Can't Pet a Possum'' (1934), which followed a story of a boy and his pet dog living in a rural part of Alabama.<ref Name="Fleming"/>

During the early 1930s, African-American writers and intellectuals were not welcomed in Northern Alabama. Just thirty miles from [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]] in [[Decatur, Alabama|Decatur]], the [[Scottsboro Boys|Scottsboro boys]] were being tried in court. During this time, Bontemps had many friends visit and stay with him while they came to Alabama to protest this trial. The school administration was worried about his many out-of-state visitors. In later years, Bontemps said that the administration at Oakwood Junior College had demanded he burn many of his private books to demonstrate that he had given up radical politics. Bontemps refused to do so. He resigned from his teaching position and returned with his family to California in 1934. <ref Name="Fleming"/>

In 1936 Bontemps published what is considered as some of his best work, ''Black Thunder''. This novel recounts the tale of a rebellion that took place in 1800 near [[Richmond, Virginia]] led by [[Gabriel Prosser]], an uneducated field worker and coachman. It shares Prosser's attempted plan to conduct a slave army to raid an armory in Richmond, and once armed with weapons, defend themselves against any assailants. A fellow slave betrayed Prosser, causing the rebellion to be shut down. Prosser was captured by whites and lynched. In Bontemps' version, whites were compelled to admit that slaves were humans who had possibilities of a promising life.<ref Name="Fleming"/>

''Black Thunder'' received many extraordinary reviews by both African-American and mainstream journals, for example, the ''Saturday Review of Literature''. Despite these rave reviews, Bontemps did not earn enough from sales of the novel to support his family in Chicago, where he had moved shortly before he published the novel. He briefly taught in Chicago at the Shiloh Academy but did not stay long, leaving for a job with the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] Illinois Writers' Project (IWP). The WPA had writers working on histories of states and major cities.  The Illinois Project was one of the most successful state projects employing a number of noted writers, who in addition to the project work also had time to work on their own writings.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Federal Writers' Project |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Chicago |publisher=Chicago History Museum and Northwestern University |url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/443.html |last=Rotella |first=Carlo}}</ref>  Bontemps, in addition to other work for the IWP, oversaw such writers as [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], [[Margaret Walker]], [[Katherine Dunham]], [[Fenton Johnson (poet)|Fenton Johnson]], [[Frank Yerby]], Richard Durham, Kitty Chapelle, and Robert Lucas, to produce a massive collection of writings on the "Negro in Illinois".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Illinois Writers Project: "Negro in Illinois" Digital Collection |url=https://www.chipublib.org/illinois-writers-project-negro-in-illinois-digital-collection/ |access-date=2021-08-13 |website=Chicago Public Library |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://illinois.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.5406/illinois/9780252037696.001.0001/upso-9780252037696 |title=The Negro in Illinois: The WPA Papers |publisher=University of Illinois Press |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-252-09495-8 |editor-last=Dolinar |editor-first=Brian  |language=en-US |doi=10.5406/illinois/9780252037696.001.0001}}</ref>

In 1938, following the publication of children's book ''[[Sad-Faced Boy]]'' (1937), Bontemps was granted a Rosenwald fellowship to work on his novel, ''Drums at Dusk'' (1939). This was based on [[Toussaint L’Ouverture]]'s slave rebellion in [[Saint-Domingue]] (which became the independent republic of Haiti). This book was more widely recognized than his other novels. Some critics viewed the plot as overdramatic, while others commended its characterizations.<ref Name="Fleming"/>

Bontemps struggled to make enough from his books to support his family. However, more important, he gained little acknowledgement for his work despite being a prolific writer. This caused him to become discouraged as an African-American writer of this time. He started to believe that it was futile for him to attempt to address his writing to his own generation, so he chose to focus his serious writing on younger and more progressive audiences. Bontemps met [[Jack Conroy]] on the Illinois Writers’ Project, and in collaboration they wrote ''The Fast Sooner Hound'' (1942). This was a children's story about a hound dog, Sooner, who races and outruns trains. Embarrassed about this, the roadmaster puts him against the fastest train, the Cannon Ball.<ref Name="Fleming"/>

Bontemps returned to graduate school and earned a master's degree in library science from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1943. He was appointed as head librarian at [[Fisk University]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. During his time there, he developed important collections and archives of African-American literature and culture, namely the Langston Hughes Renaissance Collection. Bontemps was initiated as a member of the Zeta Rho chapter of [[Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia]] fraternity at Fisk in 1954. He served at Fisk until 1964 and would continue to return occasionally.<ref Name="Fleming"/>

==Later years==
After retiring from Fisk University in 1966, Bontemps worked at the [[University of Illinois Chicago Circle Campus|University of Illinois (Chicago Circle)]]. He later moved to [[Yale University]], where he served as curator of the [[James Weldon Johnson]] Collection.<ref>Drew, Bernard A. (ed.), "Arna Bontemps", ''100 Most Popular African American Authors: Biographical Sketches and Bibliographies'', Westport, CT: Libraries Unlimited, 2007, pp. 33–36. Popular Authors Series.</ref>

During this time, Bontemps published numerous novels varying in genre. ''Slappy Hooper'' (1946), and ''Sam Patch'' (1951) were two children's books that he co wrote with [[Jack Conroy]]. Individually he published ''Lonesome Boy'' (1955) and ''Mr. Kelso’s Lion'' (1970), two other children's books. Simultaneously he was writing pieces targeted for teenagers, including biographies on [[George Washington Carver]], [[Frederick Douglass]] and [[Booker T. Washington]]. His other pieces of this time were ''Golden Slippers'' (1941), ''[[Story of the Negro]]'' (1948), ''Chariot in the Sky'' (1951) and ''Famous Negro Athletes'' (1964) (Fleming). Critics highly praised his ''Story of the Negro'', which received the [[Jane Addams Children's Book Award]] and was a [[Newbery Honor]] Book.

Bontemps worked with [[Langston Hughes]] on pieces geared toward adults. They co-edited ''The Poetry of the Negro'' (1949) – described by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as "a stimulating cross-section of the imaginative writing of the Negro" that demonstrates "talent to the point where one questions the necessity (other than for its social evidence) of the specialization of 'Negro' in the title"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1949/01/30/archives/two-rewarding-volumes-of-verse-oneway-ticket-by-langston-hughes.html|title=Two Rewarding Volumes of Verse; ONE-WAY TICKET.

Bontemps collaborated with [[Jack Conroy|Conroy]] and wrote a history of the migration of African-Americans in the United States called ''They Seek a City'' (1945). They later revised and published it as ''Anyplace But Here'' (1966). Bontemps also wrote ''100 Years of Negro Freedom'' (1961) and edited ''Great Slave Narratives'' (1969) and ''The Harlem Renaissance Remembered'' (1972). In addition he was also able to edit ''American Negro Poetry'' (1963), which was a popular anthology. He compiled his poetry in ''Personals'' (1963) and also wrote an introduction for a previous novel, ''Black Thunder'', when it was republished in 1968.<ref Name="Fleming"/>

Bontemps died aged 71 on June 4, 1973, at his home in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], from a [[Myocardial infarction|myocardial infarction (heart attack)]], while working on his collection of short fiction in ''The Old South'' (1973).<ref Name="Fleming"/>

Bontemps is buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Nashville, Tennessee.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=pv&GRid=7115834&PIpi=405826|title=Arna Wendell Bontemps (1902 - 1973) - Find A Grave Photos|website=www.findagrave.com|access-date=2017-02-24}}</ref>

Through his librarianship and bibliographic work, Bontemps became a leading figure in establishing African-American literature as a legitimate object of study and preservation.<ref Name="Fleming" /> His work as a poet, novelist, children's writer, editor, librarian and historian helped shape modern African-American literature, but it also had a tremendous influence on African-American culture.<ref Name="Fleming"/>
