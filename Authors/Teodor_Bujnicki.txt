'''Teodor Bujnicki''' (December 13, 1907 – November 27, 1944) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[poet]], and member of the literary group ''Żagary''.

During [[World War II]], Bujnicki was condemned for "collaboration with Soviet occupants" in [[Vilnius]] after [[Lithuania]]'s incorporation into the [[USSR]]. The reason for this was that he published several critical articles about the Polish pre-war authorities and the [[Sanation]] regime as the editor of a Polish-language Soviet journal. For this, Bujnicki was sentenced to death ''in absentia'' for [[treason]] by the [[Polish Underground State]] in Vilnius in 1942. However, he avoided execution, as he fled from Vilnius and hid by living with relatives in [[Panevėžys]] and [[Palanga]], during [[Nazi Germany]]'s occupation of Lithuania.

The cultural director of the [[Union of Polish Patriots]], Bujnicki returned to Vilnius continued working as the editor of the journal after the city was retaken by the [[Red Army]] in 1944. As the sentence from 1942 was never changed nor appealed, he was shot and mortally wounded by [[Waldemar Butkiewicz]], a soldier of the Polish [[Home Army]], on November 27, 1944 in Vilnius.
