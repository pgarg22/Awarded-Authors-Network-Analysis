'''Howard Browne''' (April 15, 1908 &ndash; October 28, 1999) was an American [[science fiction]] editor and [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] writer.  He also wrote for several television series and films.  Some of his work appeared over the [[pseudonym]]s John Evans, Alexander Blade, Lawrence Chandler, Ivar Jorgensen, and Lee Francis.

==Biography==
Beginning in 1942, Browne worked as managing editor for [[Ziff Davis]] publications on ''[[Amazing Stories]]'' and ''[[Fantastic Adventures]]'', both under [[Raymond A. Palmer]]'s editorship.  When Palmer left the magazines in 1949, Browne took over in January 1950.  Browne ended the publication of [[Richard Shaver]]'s [[Shaver Mystery]] and oversaw the change in ''Amazing'' from a [[pulp magazine]] to a digest.  He left the magazines in 1956 to move to [[Hollywood]].

In Hollywood, Browne wrote for television shows including ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' ("[[List of Maverick episodes|The Seventh Hand]]" with [[James Garner]] and [[Diane Brewster]] among nine other episodes), ''[[Ben Casey]]'', and ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]''.  His last credit was for the film ''[[Capone (1975 film)|Capone]]'' (1975), starring [[Ben Gazzara]].

Browne's novel ''Thin Air'' was twice adapted for television.  In 1975 it was used as the basis for a first-season episode of ''[[The Rockford Files]]'' titled "Sleight of Hand."  In 1982 it was the basis for a second-season episode of ''[[Simon & Simon]]'' of the same name as the novel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0115006/|title=Howard Browne|website=IMDb}}</ref>
