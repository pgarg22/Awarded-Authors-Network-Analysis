'''Scott Oden''' (born June 24, 1967) is an American writer best known for his [[historical novel]]s set in [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Ancient Greece]].  His work imitates the styles and themes of the 1930s pulps, most notably the historical fiction and fantasy of Texan author [[Robert E. Howard]].

==Biography==
Oden was born in [[Columbus, Indiana]] in 1967.  He graduated from Albert P. Brewer High School in 1985 and attended John C. Calhoun State Community College in [[Decatur, Alabama]], where he studied English and History.  Oden began writing at the age of 14, and his first published work was a role-playing game called "Rogue Warrior" in 1986—only memorable, Oden says, for the artwork supplied by a teen-aged [[Cully Hamner]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://guyslitwire.blogspot.com/2010/12/interview-with-scott-oden.html|title=Guys Lit Wire: Interview with Scott Oden|date=December 14, 2010}}</ref>

Oden's breakthrough novel was 2005's ''[[Men of Bronze]]''.  It was followed in 2006 by ''[[Memnon (novel)|Memnon]]'' and in 2010 with ''[[The Lion of Cairo]]'', which mixed pulp-style action and sorcery with Crusader politics in [[Fatimid Egypt]].

Oden returned in June 2017 with his critically acclaimed “Orc novel”, ''A Gathering of Ravens'' — the first in a projected trilogy of stand-alone novels featuring the savage orc Grimnir. The second book, ''Twilight of the Gods'', appeared in February 2020.

==Influences==
Oden identifies his writing influences as [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[H. P. Lovecraft]], [[Robert E. Howard]], [[Mary Renault]], [[Harold Lamb]], [[Karl Edward Wagner]], and [[Steven Pressfield]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-12-22|title=INTERVIEW: Scott Oden Brings Fantasy, History To Life|url=https://www.paintmonkslibrary.com/2019/12/22/interview-scott-oden-brings-fantasy-history-to-vivid-life/|access-date=2021-09-29|website=Paint Monk's Library|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-02-18|title=Q&A: Scott Oden, Author of 'Twilight of the Gods'|url=https://www.thenerddaily.com/scott-oden-author-interview/|access-date=2021-09-29|website=The Nerd Daily|language=en-AU}}</ref>
