'''Ronald Stuart Thomas''' (29 March 1913 – 25 September 2000), published as '''R. S. Thomas''', was a [[Wales|Welsh]] poet and [[Church in Wales|Anglican]] priest noted for nationalism, spirituality and dislike of the [[anglicisation]] of Wales. [[John Betjeman]], introducing ''Song at the Year's Turning'' (1955), the first collection of Thomas's poetry from a major publisher, predicted that Thomas would be remembered long after he himself was forgotten. M. Wynn Thomas said: "He was the [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] of Wales because he was such a troubler of the Welsh conscience. He was one of the major English language and European poets of the 20th century."<ref>{{Cite web |author=John Ezard and Geoff Gibbs |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/sep/27/books.booksnews |title=Wales loses its most sustained lyric voice |work=The Guardian |date=27 September 2000 |access-date=15 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/arts-culture-news/authors-notes-m-wynn-thomas-7319653 |title=Author's Notes: M Wynn Thomas on RS Thomas in Wales Book of Year book |publisher=Wales Online |date=16 June 2014 |access-date=15 March 2015}}</ref>

==Life==
R. S. Thomas was born in [[Cardiff]] as the only child of Margaret (née Davies) and Thomas Hubert Thomas.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://biography.wales/article/s12-THOM-STU-1913 |title=THOMAS, RONALD STUART (1913-2000), poet and clergyman |author=M. Wynn Thomas |website= [[Dictionary of Welsh Biography]] |access-date=26 August 2021}}</ref> The family moved to [[Holyhead]] in 1918 because of his father's work in the [[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|Merchant Navy]]. He was awarded a bursary in 1932 to study at the [[Bangor University|University College of North Wales]], where he read [[Latin]]. In 1936, after he completed his theological training at [[St Michael's College, Llandaff]], he was ordained as a priest in the Anglican [[Church in Wales]]. From 1936 to 1940 he was the curate of [[Chirk]], Denbighshire, where he met his future wife, [[Mildred Eldridge|Mildred "Elsi" Eldridge]], an English artist. He subsequently became curate-in charge of [[Willington Worthenbury|Tallarn Green]], [[Flintshire]], as part of his duties as curate of [[Hanmer, Wales|Hanmer]].

In Hanmer he was an assistant to the Rev. Thomas Meredith-Morris, grandfather of the writer [[Lorna Sage]], a fact later described by [[Byron Rogers (author)|Byron Rogers]] as a "crossing of paths of two of Wales's strangest clergymen". Whilst Sage devotes a great deal of her autobiography ''Bad Blood'' to her late relative, she does not mention Thomas, who was in any case in Hanmer before Sage was born. However, her memoir gives some insight into the strange environment in which Thomas worked as a young priest.<ref>[[Lorna Sage]] (2001), ''Bad Blood'', Fourth Estate.</ref> Thomas never wrote much about his curacies and nothing is known of the relationship between him and Meredith-Morris.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Rogers |first=Byron |authorlink=Byron Rogers (author) |year=2006 |title=The Man Who Went into the West: The Life of R.

Thomas and Eldridge were married in 1940 and remained together until her death in 1991. Their son, (Andreas) Gwydion, was born on 29 August 1945 and died on 15 September 2016.<ref>''The Man Who Went Into The West'', Byron Rogers, p. 154.</ref> Gwydion often spoke about his difficult upbringing with a family living in near poverty, while he was sent to a number of traumatic boarding schools.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/bbc-huw-thomas/gwydion-thomas/365725817110966/ |title=Gwydion Thomas |website=www.facebook.com |access-date=2 September 2017}}</ref> The Thomas family lived on a tiny income and lacked the comforts of modern life, largely through their own choice. One of the few household amenities the family ever owned, a vacuum cleaner, was rejected because Thomas decided it was too noisy.<ref name=dalrymple>Theodore Dalrymple, [http://www.city-journal.org/html/rev2006-11-06td.html "A Man Out of Time: A life of poet R. S. Thomas entertains and illumines"], a review of ''The Man Who Went into the West: The Life of R. S. Thomas'', by [[Byron Rogers (author)|Byron Rogers]], in ''[[City Journal (New York)|City Journal]]'', 6 November 2006. Retrieved 30 December 2006.</ref>

From 1942 to 1954 Thomas was rector of [[St Michael's Church, Manafon]], near [[Welshpool]] in rural [[Montgomeryshire]]. During his time there he began to study Welsh and published his first three volumes of poetry, ''The Stones of the Field'' (1946), ''An Acre of Land'' (1952) and ''The Minister'' (1953). Thomas's poetry achieved a breakthrough with the publication in 1955 of his fourth book, ''Song at the Year's Turning'', in effect a collected edition of his first three volumes. This was critically well received and opened with an introduction by Betjeman. His position was also helped by winning the [[Royal Society of Literature]]'s Heinemann Award.

Thomas learnt the Welsh language from the age of 30,<ref name=dalrymple/> – too late in life, he said, to be able to write poetry in it. The 1960s saw him working in a predominantly Welsh-speaking community and he later wrote two prose works in Welsh, ''Neb'' (''Nobody''), an ironic and revealing autobiography written in the third person, and ''Blwyddyn yn Llŷn'' (''A Year in Llŷn''). In 1964 he won the [[Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry]]. From 1967 to 1978 he was vicar of [[Church of St Hywyn, Aberdaron|St Hywyn's Church]] (built 1137) in [[Aberdaron]] at the western tip of the [[Llŷn Peninsula]].

Thomas retired as a clergyman in 1978. He and his wife moved to [[Y Rhiw]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.st-hywyn.org.uk/rsthomas.htm |title="R S Thomas" at st-hywyn.org.uk |access-date=2 September 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503120156/http://www.st-hywyn.org.uk/rsthomas.htm |archive-date=3 May 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> into "a tiny, unheated cottage in one of the most beautiful parts of Wales, where, however, the temperature sometimes dipped below freezing," according to [[Theodore Dalrymple]].<ref name=dalrymple/> Free from church constraints, he was able to become more political and active in campaigns that were important to him. He became a fierce advocate of [[Welsh nationalism]], although he never supported [[Plaid Cymru]], as it recognised the [[Houses of Parliament|English Parliament]] and so in his view fell short in its opposition to England.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/sep/27/guardianobituaries.books?INTCMP=SRCH |title=R S Thomas |first=Byron |last=Rogers |authorlink=Byron Rogers (author) |date=26 September 2000 |access-date=2 September 2017 |via=The Guardian}}</ref>

Thomas was nominated for the 1996 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/r-s-thomas-nominated-for-nobel-prize-1590561.html |title=R S Thomas nominated for Nobel prize |date=9 July 1995 |access-date=2 September 2017}}</ref> the winner of which was [[Wislawa Szymborska]].

Thomas died on 25 September 2000 aged 87, at his home in Pentrefelin near [[Criccieth]], survived by his second wife, Elizabeth Vernon.<ref name="auto"/> He had been ill with a heart condition and treated at [[Ysbyty Gwynedd]] in [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]] until two weeks before he died.<ref name=guardian/><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/942723.stm |title=BBC News – WALES – RS Thomas – Wales's outspoken poet |website=news.bbc.co.uk |access-date=2 September 2017}}</ref> A memorial event celebrating his life and poetry was held at [[Westminster Abbey]] with readings from Heaney, [[Andrew Motion]], [[Gillian Clarke]] and [[John Burnside (writer)|John Burnside]]. Thomas's ashes are buried near the door of St John's Church, [[Porthmadog]], Gwynedd.

==Beliefs and contribution to spirituality==
===Religious views===
Thomas's son, Gwydion, a resident of [[Thailand]], recalls his father's sermons, in which he would "drone on" to absurd lengths about the evil of refrigerators, washing machines, televisions and other modern devices. Thomas preached that they were all part of the temptation of scrambling after gadgets rather than attending to more spiritual needs. "It was the Machine, you see," Gwydion explained to a biographer. "This to a congregation that didn't have any of these things and were longing for them."<ref name=dalrymple/> Although he may have taken some ideas to extreme lengths, Theodore Dalrymple wrote, Thomas "was raising a deep and unanswered question: What is life for? Is it simply to consume more and more, and divert ourselves with ever more elaborate entertainments and gadgetry? What will this do to our souls?"<ref name=dalrymple/> He had a reputation, which perhaps he cultivated, of being not always charitable and sometimes awkward and taciturn. Some critics have interpreted photographs of him as indicating he was "formidable, bad-tempered, and apparently humourless."<ref name=dalrymple/>

In terms of religion, although he sometimes appeared to lack charity and patience, Thomas served as a Church in Wales parish priest all his working life. His training at [[St Michael's College, Llandaff]], placed him somewhat in the [[Oxford Movement|Tractarian Tradition]], though he does not seem to have been more than central in his position as regards the conduct of services.<ref>J. Wintle, 1997, ''Furious Interiors: Wales, RS Thomas and God'', London: Flamingo.</ref> Although a fervent Welsh nationalist, he appears to have preferred the 1662 [[Book of Common Prayer]] of the [[Church of England]] (even in Welsh translation) over the 1966 order for the Holy Eucharist which the Church in Wales produced for itself and which came into use during his final year at [[Eglwys Fach]]. In one of his autobiographical books, he asserted that in retirement he could no longer bring himself to go to [[Holy Communion]] on account of the changes, although one of his successors at Aberdaron indicated that Thomas always retained the bishop's permission to officiate and occasionally did so at [[Llanfaelrhys]], when no one else could be found.<ref>R. S. Thomas (1997), '' Autobiographies'', (translated by Damian Walford Davies), London: Orion.</ref> His prime objection to the revised services was that since the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962–65) – which also had liturgical repercussions within Anglicanism – he could not bear to see the priest facing the people when in reality he should be leading the people towards God from the traditional east-facing position. "It is to God that the mystery belongs," he wrote pointedly, "and woe to man when he interferes with that mystery. As T. S. Eliot says: 'Humankind cannot bear very much reality.'"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/nov/15/ts-eliot-festival-donmar-jeanette-winterson |title=Jeanette Winterson on the consoling power of poetry as a TS Eliot festival opens in London |first=Jeanette |last=Winterson |author-link=Jeanette Winterson |date=15 November 2008 |via=www.theguardian.com |access-date=19 May 2020}}</ref>

Thomas seems early on to have become interested in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] (an interest he did not pursue beyond some interfaith study) and over time he appears to have had some sympathy with the theological explorations of the one-time [[Bishop of Woolwich]] [[John Robinson (bishop of Woolwich)|John A. T. Robinson]] in his 1963 ''Honest to God'', on one occasion going as far as to describe the [[Resurrection of Christ]] as a "metaphor". In a letter to a theological student in 1993 he denied he held similar views to the non-realist Cambridge theologian and philosopher [[Don Cupitt]]. "I believe in revelation," Thomas wrote, "and therefore one cannot describe all one's insights as entirely human."{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Above all, his main influence appears to have been the philosopher [[Kierkegaard]] – and his "leap of faith" – although he also appears to have concerned himself with the limitations of religious language in an era becoming progressively more post-Christian in the face of science and philosophy. Yet for all his explorations, his sermons and practice as a priest do not seem to have been heterodox,<ref>B. Rogers (2006), ''The Man who Went into the West: the Life of R. S. Thomas'', London: Aurum</ref> even if in retirement he was to write to his long-term friend, the poet [[Raymond Garlick]],<ref>R. S. Thomas (2009), ''Letters to Raymond Garlick'', Llandyssul: [[Gomer Press|Gomer]].</ref> to give him "the address of a retired Christian".

As a priest, it seems that Thomas did not believe he was there to promote his own views, but those of the church he served, and for all his vaunted crabbiness, he seems to have been well enough regarded by parishioners, though biographies offer notable exceptions. He has been credited by some as a capable listener and counsellor at a time when such things were not common among the clergy, and to have been a devoted visitor to the sick. However, his tendency to remoteness led one of his successors to say that she had, as parish priest of Aberdaron, to "do a lot of healing". Nonetheless, his influence as a poet had a considerable impact on spirituality, to the extent that on the centenary of his birth, [[Archbishop of Wales]], [[Barry Morgan (bishop)|Barry Morgan]], who had known the poet personally, paid tribute to him:
<blockquote>
R. S. Thomas continues to articulate through his poetry questions that are inscribed on the heart of most Christian pilgrims in their search for meaning and truth. We search for God and feel Him near at hand, only then to blink and find Him gone. This poetry persuades us that we are not alone in this experience of faith – the poet has been there before us.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-22494073 |title=RS Thomas centenary celebrated by Bangor Cathedral service |publisher=BBC |date=11 May 2013 |access-date=15 March 2015}}</ref>
</blockquote>

==Other views==
Thomas believed in what he called "the true Wales of my imagination", a Welsh-speaking aboriginal community in tune with the natural world.<ref>R. S. Thomas (1997), edited and translated by Jason Walford Davies. ''Autobiographies''. London: J. M. Dent, p. 10, cited in Tony Brown. [https://books.google.co.uk/books?redir_esc=y&id=X3NlAAAAMAAJ&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=%22true+wales+of+my+imagination%22 ''R. S. Thomas'']. [[University of Wales Press]], 2006.</ref> He viewed western (specifically English) materialism and greed, represented in the poetry by his mythical "Machine", as the destroyers of community. He could tolerate neither the English who bought up Wales and in his view stripped it of its wild and essential nature, nor the Welsh whom he saw as all too eager to kowtow to English money and influence.<ref>Tony Brown, ''R. S. Thomas''. [[University of Wales Press]], 2006.</ref>

Thomas was an ardent supporter of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] (CND) and described himself as a [[Pacifism|pacifist]], but also supported the nationalist ''[[Meibion Glyndŵr]]'' fire bombings of English-owned holiday cottages in rural Wales. On this subject he said in 1998, "What is one death against the death of the whole Welsh nation?"<ref name=guardian>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/sep/27/books.booksnews |title=Wales loses its most sustained lyric voice |first1=John |last1=Ezard |first2=Geoff |last2=Gibbs|date=27 September 2000 |via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> He was also active in wildlife preservation and worked with the [[RSPB]] and Welsh volunteer organisations for the preservation of the [[red kite]]. He resigned his RSPB membership over their plans to introduce non-native kites to Wales.

'''Evans'''
Evans? Yes, many a time
I came down his bare flight
Of stairs into the gaunt kitchen
With its wood fire, where crickets sang
Accompaniment to the black kettle's
Whine, and so into the cold
Dark to smother in the thick tide
Of night that drifted about the walls
Of his stark farm on the hill ridge.

It was not the dark filling my eyes
And mouth appalled me; not even the drip
Of rain like blood from the one tree
Weather-tortured. It was the dark
Silting the veins of that sick man
I left stranded upon the vast
And lonely shore of his bleak bed.
</poem>|source = "Evans" from ''Poetry for Supper'' (1958)}}

Almost all of Thomas's work concerns the Welsh landscape and the Welsh people, themes with both political and spiritual subtext. His views on the position of the Welsh people, as a conquered people are never far below the surface. As a cleric, his religious views are also present in his works. His earlier works focus on the personal stories of his parishioners, the farm labourers and working men and their wives, challenging the cosy view of the traditional pastoral poem with harsh and vivid descriptions of rural lives. The beauty of the landscape, although ever-present, is never suggested as a compensation for the low pay or monotonous conditions of farm work. This direct view of "country life" comes as a challenge to many English writers writing on similar subjects and challenging the more pastoral works of contemporary poets such as [[Dylan Thomas]].

Thomas's later works were of a more [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] nature, more experimental in their style and focusing more overtly on his spirituality. ''Laboratories of the Spirit'' (1975) gives, in its title, a hint at this development and also reveals Thomas's increasing experiments with scientific metaphor. He described this shift as an investigation into the "adult geometry of the mind". Fearing that poetry was becoming a dying art, inaccessible to those who most needed it, "he attempted to make spiritually minded poems relevant within, and relevant to, a science-minded, post-industrial world," to represent that world both in form and in content even as he rejected its machinations.<ref>Daniel Westover, ''R. S. Thomas: A Stylistic Biography''. [[University of Wales Press]], 2011.</ref>

Despite his nationalism Thomas could be hard on his fellow countrymen. Often his works read more as a criticism of Welshness than a celebration. He said there is a "lack of love for human beings" in his poetry. Other critics have been less harsh. [[Al Alvarez]] said, "He was wonderful, very pure, very bitter, but the bitterness was beautifully and very sparely rendered. He was completely authoritative, a very, very fine poet, completely off on his own, out of the loop but a real individual. It's not about being a major or minor poet. It's about getting a work absolutely right by your own standards and he did that wonderfully well."<ref name=guardian/>

Thomas's final works commonly sold 20,000 copies in Britain alone.<ref name=dalrymple/>
