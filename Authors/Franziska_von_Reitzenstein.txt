'''Franziska Freifrau'''{{efn|{{German title Freiherr}}}} '''von Reitzenstein''' (née von Nyss;<ref>[http://www.zeno.org/Pataky-1898/A/Reitzenstein,+Franziska+Freifrau+v. ''Reitzenstein, Franziska Freifrau v.''] (German), Lexikon deutscher Frauen der Feder.</ref> alias '''"Franz von Nemmersdorf"'''; September 19, 1834 – June 4, 1896) was a [[German People|German]] novelist.

==Biography==
Von Reitzenstein was born the daughter of a judicial counselor (Oberappellations-Gerichtsrat) in Castle Härdenstein in [[Swabia]]. She was well educated and moved in aristocratic and noble circles. In 1849 she married the royal Bavarian [[Rittmeister]] [[Freiherr]] von Reitzenstein. After her husband died in 1853, she travelled to several places of Italy and was inspired to write by [[Karl Gutzkow]]. She randomized her male pen name "Franz" in a topographical, statistical lexicon, whereas Nemmersdorf was the former name of a settlement in [[East Prussia]], today [[Mayakovskoye]].

Under her pen name she wrote novels in particular, also some with historical themes. Later she followed in [[Paolo Mantegazza]]'s footsteps and dedicated her work ''Kampf der Geschlechter'' to him, which dealt with the relations between women and men and of the question of women's rights. She wrote also for journals and newspapers, amongst them the "[[Allgemeine Zeitung]]" in [[Augsburg]], the "Münchener Zeitung" (literally: [[Munich]]'s newspaper) as well as the appending "Unterhaltungsblatt" (entertainment paper), also [[Ernst Keil|Keil]]'s „Die Gartenlaube“ and several papers in [[Vienna]]. Von Reitzenstein owned a house in Munich, where she lived with her cats, which was why she was called "cat baroness" by her neighbors<ref>[http://de.wikisource.org/wiki/ADB:Reitzenstein,_Franziska_Freifrau_von ADB (de)]</ref> She is buried in the [[Alter Südfriedhof|Old Southern Cemetery]] in Munich. Her grave tomb was designed by [[Friedrich von Thiersch]].
