'''Thomas Parnell''' (11 September 1679 – 24 October 1718)<ref>"Clogher clergy and parishes : being an account of the clergy of the Church of Ireland in the Diocese of Clogher, from the earliest period, with historical notices of the several parishes, churches, etc" Leslie, J.B. pp44/5: Enniskille; R. H. Ritchie; 1929</ref> was an Anglo-Irish poet and clergyman who was a friend of both [[Alexander Pope]] and [[Jonathan Swift]].

He was born in [[Dublin]], the son of Thomas Parnell (died 1685) of Maryborough, Queen's County (now [[Portlaoise]], [[County Laois]]), a prosperous landowner who had been a loyal supporter of  [[Oliver Cromwell]] during the [[English Civil War]] and moved from  [[Congleton]],  [[Cheshire]] to Ireland after the [[Restoration of Charles II]]. His mother was Anne Grice of Kilosty,  [[County Tipperary]]: she also owned property in [[County Armagh]], which she left to Thomas at her death in 1709. Thomas was educated at [[Trinity College, Dublin]] and collated as [[Archdeacon of Clogher]] in 1705.<ref name=AIF>{{cite web| url = http://www.irishmidlandsancestry.com/content/family_history/families/anglo_irish1.htm| title = Anglo-Irish Families| publisher = Irish Midlands Ancestry| accessdate = 10 October 2013| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110713060800/http://www.irishmidlandsancestry.com/content/family_history/families/anglo_irish1.htm| archivedate = 13 July 2011}}</ref> In the  last years  of  the  reign of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne of England]] he was a popular  preacher, but  her death  put an  end  to  his hope of career advancement. He married Anne (Nancy) Minchin, daughter of  Thomas 
Minchin,  who  died  in 1712, and had three  children, two of  whom  died young. The third child, a girl, is said to have reached a great age. The marriage was a  very happy one, and it has been said that Thomas never recovered from Nancy's early death.

He  spent much of his time in London, where he participated with Pope, Swift and others in the [[Scriblerus Club]], contributing to ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'' and aiding Pope in his translation of [[The Iliad]]. He was also one of the so-called "[[Graveyard poets]]": his 'A Night-Piece on Death,' widely considered the first "Graveyard School" poem, was published posthumously in ''Poems on Several Occasions'', collected and edited by [[Alexander Pope]] and is thought by some scholars to have been published in December 1721 (although dated in 1722 on its title page, the year accepted by ''The Concise Oxford Chronology of English Literature'';<ref name=cocel>Cox, Michael, editor, ''The Concise Oxford Chronology of English Literature'', Oxford University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-19-860634-6}}</ref> see [[1721 in poetry]], [[1722 in poetry]]). It is said of his poetry, "it was in keeping with his character, easy and pleasing, enunciating the common places with felicity and grace."<ref>Gilfillan, George , dissertation in ''The Poetical Works of Johnson, Parnell, Gray and Smollett'' 1855, kindle ebook 1855  ASIN B004TQHGGE</ref>

He was  a very  heavy  drinker, especially  after  his wife's early 
death, and drinking undermined his health. He died in [[Chester]] in 1718 on his way home to Ireland. His wife and two sons having died, his Laois estate passed to his brother [[John Parnell (1680–1727)|John]], a judge and MP in the [[Irish House of Commons]] and the ancestor of [[Charles Stewart Parnell]].<ref name = AIF/>

[[Oliver Goldsmith]] wrote a biography of Parnell<ref>Goldsmith, Oliver ''The Life of Thomas Parnell'' {{ISBN|978-1-171-10588-6}}</ref> which often accompanied later editions of Parnell's works. Poet [[Azizunnessa Khatun]] translated one of Parnell's works into the [[Bengali language]] under the title ''Udasīn Kabbo'' in 1884.<ref name="KA">{{cite Banglapedia|author=Amin, Nurul|article=Khatun, Azizunnesa}}</ref>

An example of his poetry is the opening stanza of his poem ''The Hermit'':<ref>The [[:s:Gesta Romanorum Vol. I (1871)/Of the Cunning of the Devil and of the secret Judgments of God#endnote068|full text]] of this poetic fable is available on Wikisource following an earlier version of the fable in [[Gesta Romanorum]].</ref><poem>Far in the wild, unknown to public view,
From youth to age a revered hermit grew.
The moss his bed, the cave his humble cell,
His food the fruits, his drink the crystal well.
Remote from man with God he passed his days
Prayer all his business, all his pleasure, praise. </poem>
