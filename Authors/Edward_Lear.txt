He also composed and published twelve musical settings of Tennyson's poetry.

==Biography==

===Early years===
[[File:Edward Lear drawing.jpg|thumb|upright|Lear by [[Wilhelm Marstrand]]]]
Lear was born into a middle-class family at [[Holloway, London|Holloway]], North London, the penultimate of 21 children (and youngest to survive) of Ann Clark Skerrett and Jeremiah Lear, a stockbroker formerly working for the family sugar refining business.<ref>{{cite web|author=James Williams (University of Cambridge) |url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&UID=2659 |title=Literary Encyclopedia &#124; Edward Lear |publisher=Litencyc.com |date=20 July 2004 |access-date=28 January 2014}}</ref><ref>Edward Lear, Ina Rae Hark, Twayne Publishers, 1982, pg 2</ref> He was raised by his eldest sister, also named Ann, 21 years his senior. Jeremiah Lear ended up defaulting to the London Stock Exchange in the economic upheaval following the Napoleonic Wars;<ref>''Pictures at an Exhibition: Selected Essays on Art and Art Therapy'', ed. Andrea Gilroy and Tessa Dalley, Routledge, 1989, pg 66</ref> owing to the family's now more limited finances, Lear and his sister were required to leave the family home, Bowmans Lodge, and live together when he was aged four. Ann doted on Edward and continued to act as a mother for him until her death, when he was almost 50 years of age.<ref>Jackson, Holbrook (ed). ''The Complete Nonsense of Edward Lear''. Dover Publications, 1951. Page xii.</ref>

Lear suffered from lifelong health afflictions. From the age of six he suffered frequent ''grand mal'' [[epileptic seizure]]s, [[bronchitis]], [[asthma]] and, during later life, partial blindness. Lear experienced his first seizure at a fair near Highgate with his father. The event scared and embarrassed him. Lear felt lifelong guilt and shame for his epileptic condition. His adult diaries indicate that he always sensed the onset of a seizure in time to remove himself from public view. When Lear was about seven years old he began to show signs of depression, possibly due to the instability of his childhood. He suffered from periods of severe [[melancholia]] which he referred to as "the Morbids".<ref>{{cite book |title=The Complete Verse and Other Nonsense |url=https://archive.org/details/completeverseoth00lear |url-access=limited |last=Lear |first=Edward |year=2002 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=New York |isbn=0-14-200227-5 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/completeverseoth00lear/page/19 19]–20}}</ref>

===Artist===
[[File:Masada (or Sebbeh) on the Dead Sea, Edward Lear, 1858.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Masada]] on the [[Dead Sea]]'', Edward Lear, 1858]]
Lear was already drawing "for bread and cheese" by the time he was aged 16 and soon developed into a serious "ornithological draughtsman" employed by the [[Zoological Society of London|Zoological Society]] and then from 1832 to 1836 by the [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]], who kept a private menagerie at his estate, [[Knowsley Hall]]. He was the first major bird artist to draw birds from real live birds, instead of skins. Lear's first publication, published when he was 19 years old, was ''[[Illustrations of the Family of Psittacidae, or Parrots]]'' in 1830.<ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Lear, Edward |first=Charles William|last=Sutton|volume=32}}</ref> One of the greatest ornithological artists of his era, he taught [[Elizabeth Gould (illustrator)|Elizabeth Gould]] whilst also contributing to [[John Gould]]'s works and was compared by some to the naturalist [[John James Audubon]]. After his eyesight deteriorated too much to work with such precision on the fine drawings and etchings of plates used in lithography, he turned to landscape painting and travel.<ref>Roger F. Pastier & John Farrand, Jr., ''Masterpieces of Bird Art, 700 Years of Ornithological Illustration'', pp. 122–123, Abbeville Press, New York, 1991, {{ISBN|1-55859-134-6}}</ref>

Among other travels, he visited [[Greece]] and [[Egypt]] during 1848–49, and toured India during 1873–75, including a brief detour to [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]]. While travelling he produced large quantities of coloured [[wash (visual arts)|wash]] drawings in a distinctive style, which he converted later in his studio into oil and [[watercolour]] paintings, as well as prints for his books.<ref>Andrew Wilton & Anne Lyles, ''The Great Age of British Watercolours (1750–1880)'', p. 318, 1993, Prestel, {{ISBN|3-7913-1254-5}}</ref> His landscape style often shows views with strong sunlight, with intense contrasts of colour.<ref>Hofer, Philip. 1967. ''Edward Lear as a landscape draughtsman.'' Cambridge: Mass., Belknap Press of Harvard University Press.</ref>

Between 1878 and 1883, Lear spent his summers on [[Monte Generoso]], a mountain on the border between the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] canton of [[Ticino]] and the Italian region of [[Lombardy]]. His [[oil painting]] ''The Plains of Lombardy from Monte Generoso'' is in the [[Ashmolean Museum]] in [[Oxford]].<ref name=swac>{{cite book |title=Switzerland Without A Car |year=2013 |publisher=[[Bradt Travel Guides]] |location=Chalfont St. Peter |edition=5th |isbn=978-1-84162-447-1 |pages=336–7 |first=Anthony |last=Lambert}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/the-plains-of-lombardy-from-monte-generoso-142266 |title= The Plains of Lombardy from Monte Generoso |work=[[Art UK]] |access-date=27 June 2014}}</ref>

Throughout his life, he continued to paint seriously. He had a lifelong ambition to illustrate [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]]'s poems; near the end of his life, a volume with a small number of illustrations was published.

=== ''Illustrated Excursions in Italy'' (1842–46) ===
[[File:Edward Lear - Temple of Venus and Rome, Rome - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[Temple of Venus and Roma]], Rome]]
[[File:Castello di Celano 02.jpg|thumb|Engraving of [[Celano]]]]
In 1842, Lear began a journey into the [[Italian peninsula]], travelling through the [[Lazio]], [[Rome]], [[Abruzzo]], [[Molise]], [[Apulia]], [[Basilicata]], [[Calabria]], and [[Sicily]]. In personal notes, together with drawings, Lear gathered his impressions on the Italian way of life, folk traditions, and the beauty of the ancient monuments. Of particular interest to Lear was the [[Abruzzo]], which he visited in 1843, through the [[Marsica]] (Celano, Avezzano, [[Alba Fucens]], Trasacco) and the plateau of Cinque Miglia ([[Castel di Sangro]] and Alfedena), by an old sheep track of the shepherds.

Lear drew a sketch of the medieval village of Albe with Mount Sirente, and described the medieval village of Celano, with the castle of Piccolomini dominating the vast plain of Lago Fucino, which was drained a few years later to promote agricultural development. At Castel di Sangro, Lear described the winter stillness of the mountains and the beautiful basilica.

===Composer and musician===
[[File:Lear 1887.jpg|thumb|250px|upright|Lear in 1887, a year before his death. His arm was bent as he was holding his cat, [[Foss (cat)|Foss]], who leapt away.]]
Lear primarily played the piano, but he also played the accordion, flute, and small guitar.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lodge |first1=Sara |title=Inventing Edward Lear |date=2019 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-98905-4 |page=22 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6yuBDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA22 |language=en}}</ref> He composed music for many Romantic and Victorian poems, but was known mostly for his many musical settings of Tennyson's poetry. He published four settings in 1853, five in 1859, and three in 1860. Lear's were the only musical settings that Tennyson approved of. Lear also composed music for many of his nonsense songs, including "The Owl and the Pussy-cat," but only two of the scores have survived, the music for "The Courtship of the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bò" and "The Pelican Chorus". While he never played professionally, he did perform his own nonsense songs and his settings of others' poetry at countless social gatherings, sometimes adding his own lyrics (as with the song "The Nervous Family"), and sometimes replacing serious lyrics with nursery rhymes.<ref>Noakes, Vivien. ''Edward Lear: The Life of a Wanderer'', Revised Edition, pp. 99–100, 2004, {{ISBN|9780750937443}}</ref>

===Relationships===
Lear's most fervent and painful friendship was with Franklin Lushington. He met the young barrister in Malta in 1849 and then toured southern Greece with him. Lear developed an infatuation for him that Lushington did not wholly reciprocate. Although they remained friends for almost forty years, until Lear's death, the disparity of their feelings constantly tormented Lear. Indeed, Lear's attempts at male companionship were not always successful; the very intensity of Lear's affections may have doomed these relationships.<ref>Susan Chitty, That Singular Person Called Lear, Atheneum, 1989</ref>

The closest he came to marriage was two proposals, both to the same woman 46 years his junior, which were not accepted. For companions, he relied instead on friends and correspondents, and especially, during later life, on his Albanian [[Souliotes|Souliote]] chef, Giorgis, a faithful friend and, as Lear complained, a thoroughly unsatisfactory chef.<ref>Levi, Peter.  ''Edward Lear, a Biography.''</ref> Another trusted companion in San Remo was his cat, [[Foss (cat)|Foss]], who died in 1887 and was buried with some ceremony in a garden at Villa Tennyson.

===San Remo and death===
Lear travelled widely throughout his life and eventually settled in [[Sanremo|San Remo]], on his beloved Mediterranean coast in the 1870s at a villa he named "Villa Tennyson."

Lear was known to introduce himself with a long pseudonym: "Mr Abebika kratoponoko Prizzikalo Kattefello Ablegorabalus Ableborinto phashyph" or "Chakonoton the Cozovex Dossi Fossi Sini Tomentilla Coronilla Polentilla
Battledore & Shuttlecock Derry down Derry Dumps", which he based on ''[[Aldiborontiphoskyphorniostikos]]''.<ref name="Pendlebury">{{cite web|url=http://eprints.ru.ac.za/1292/1/ReadingNonsense.pdf|title=Reading Nonsense: A Journey through the writing of Edward Lear|last=Pendlebury|first=Kathleen Sarah|date=November 2007|work=A thesis submitted in fulfilment of the Requirements for the degree of MASTERS OF ARTS of RHODES UNIVERSITY|publisher=RHODES UNIVERSITY|pages=20–21|access-date=14 February 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718173749/http://eprints.ru.ac.za/1292/1/ReadingNonsense.pdf|archive-date=18 July 2011}}</ref>
[[File:Lear epitaph.jpg|thumb|Lear's grave in [[San Remo, Italy]] where he is buried alongside Giorgio Cocali, ''"A Christian Albanian of Suli"'',  ''"He was for 39 years the faithful servant and friend of Edward Lear"''.]]
After a long decline in his health, Lear died at his villa in 1888 of [[heart disease]], from which he had suffered since at least 1870. Lear's funeral was described as a sad, lonely affair by the wife of Dr. Hassall, Lear's physician, none of Lear's many lifelong friends being able to attend.<ref>Strachie, Lady Constance Braham. ''Later Letters of Edward Lear: Author of "The Book of Nonsense."'' 1911: Duffield and Company. P. 332</ref>

Lear is buried in the Cemetery Foce in San Remo.  On his headstone are inscribed these lines about Mount Tomohrit (in Albania) from Tennyson's poem ''To E.L. [Edward Lear], On His Travels in Greece'':
{{poemquote|
{{spaces|30}}all things fair.
With such a pencil, such a pen.
You shadow'd forth to distant men,
I read and felt that I was there.<ref>{{cite ODNB|title=Lear, Edward (1812–1888)|id=16247|first=Vivien|last=Noakes}}</ref>}}

The centenary of his death was marked in Britain with a set of Royal Mail stamps in 1988 and an exhibition at the [[Royal Academy]]. Lear's birthplace area is now marked with a plaque at Bowman's Mews, Islington, in London, and his bicentenary during 2012 was celebrated with a variety of events, exhibitions and lectures in venues across the world including an International Owl and Pussycat Day on his birth anniversary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://teachingnonsenseinschools.wordpress.com |title=International Owl & Pussycat Day, 12 May &#124; Just another WordPress.com site |publisher=Teachingnonsenseinschools.wordpress.com |access-date=16 January 2012}}</ref>

[[File:Howatke by Edward Lear 1867.jpg|thumb|left|''Howatke'', by Edward Lear, 1867]]
In 1846, Lear published ''[[:s:The Book of Nonsense|A Book of Nonsense]],'' a volume of limericks which went through three editions and helped popularise the form and the genre of [[literary nonsense]]. In 1871, he published ''Nonsense Songs, Stories, Botany and Alphabets'', which included the nonsense song, ''[[The Owl and the Pussycat]],'' which he wrote for the children of his patron [[Edward Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby]]. Many other works followed.

Lear's nonsense books were quite popular during his lifetime, but a rumour developed that "Edward Lear" was merely a pseudonym, and the books' true author was the man to whom Lear had dedicated the works, his patron the Earl of Derby. Promoters of this rumour offered as evidence that both men were named Edward, and that "Lear" is an [[anagram]] of "Earl".<ref>{{cite book|last=Lear|first=Edward|title=More Nonsense Pictures, Rhymes, Botany, etc.|year=1894|chapter=Introduction|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13650/13650-h/13650-h.htm#introduction3}}</ref>
[[File:The falls of the Kalama Albania 1851 by Edward Lear 1812-1888.jpg|thumb|''The falls of the Kalama'', [[Albania]] 1851]]
Lear's nonsense works are distinguished by a facility of verbal invention and a poet's delight in the sounds of words, both real and imaginary. A stuffed [[rhinoceros]] becomes a "diaphanous doorscraper." A "blue Boss-Woss" plunges into "a perpendicular, spicular, orbicular, quadrangular, circular depth of soft mud." His heroes are Quangle-Wangles, Pobbles, and Jumblies. One of his most famous verbal inventions, the phrase "[[runcible]] spoon," occurs in the closing lines of ''[[The Owl and the Pussycat]],'' and is now found in many English dictionaries:
{{poemquote|
They dined on [[Ground meat|mince]] and slices of [[quince]],
    Which they ate with a [[runcible]] spoon;
And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand
    They danced by the light of the moon,
                The moon,
                The moon,
    They danced by the light of the moon.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lear |first=Edward |author-link=Edward Lear |editor-last=Strachey |editor-first=Constance Braham, Lady |title=The Complete Nonsense Book |date=1912 |publisher=Duffield & Company |location=New York |oclc=1042550888 |url=https://archive.org/details/completenonsense01lear |pages=[https://archive.org/details/completenonsense01lear/page/125 125]-127}}</ref>
|source=lines 27–33}}

Though known for his [[neologisms]], Lear used a number of other devices in his works in order to defy [[Schema (psychology)|reader expectations]]. For example, "Cold Are the Crabs"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ingeb.org/songs/coldaret.html |title=Cold Are the Crabs |publisher=Ingeb.org |access-date=16 January 2012}}</ref> conforms to the [[sonnet]] tradition until its dramatically foreshortened last line.

[[Image:1862ca-a-book-of-nonsense--edward-lear-001.jpg|thumb|''A Book of Nonsense'' (c. 1875 James Miller edition) by Edward Lear]]
Today, limericks are invariably typeset as five lines. Lear's limericks, however, were published in a variety of formats; it appears that Lear wrote them in manuscript in as many lines as there was room for beneath the picture. For the first three editions, most are typeset as, respectively, two, five, and three lines. The cover of one edition<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nonsenselit.org/Lear/BoN/index.html |title=Edward Lear, A Book of Nonsense |publisher=Nonsenselit.org |access-date=16 January 2012}}</ref> bears an entire limerick typeset in two lines:
{{poemquote|
There was an Old Derry down Derry, who loved to see little folks merry;
So he made them a Book, and with laughter they shook, at the fun of that Derry down Derry!}}

In Lear's limericks, the first and last lines usually end with the same word rather than rhyming. For the most part they are truly nonsensical and devoid of any punch line or point. They are completely free of the [[off-color humour|bawdiness]] with which the verse form is now associated. A typical thematic element is the presence of a callous and critical "they." An example of a typical Lear limerick:
{{poemquote|
There was an Old Man of [[Aosta|Aôsta]]
Who possessed a large Cow, but he lost her;
But they said, "Don't you see she has run up a tree,
You invidious Old Man of Aôsta?"<ref>{{cite book |last=Lear |first=Edward |author-link=Edward Lear |editor-last=Strachey |editor-first=Constance Braham, Lady |title=The Complete Nonsense Book |date=1912 |publisher=Duffield & Company |location=New York |oclc=1042550888 |url=https://archive.org/details/completenonsense01lear |page=[https://archive.org/details/completenonsense01lear/page/108 108]}}</ref>}}

Lear's self-description in verse, ''How Pleasant to know Mr. Lear,'' ends with this [[stanza]], a reference to his own mortality:
{{poemquote|
He reads, but he cannot speak, Spanish,
    He cannot abide ginger-beer:
Ere the days of his pilgrimage vanish,
    How pleasant to know Mr. Lear!<ref>{{cite book |last=Lear |first=Edward |author-link=Edward Lear |editor-last=Strachey |editor-first=Constance Braham, Lady |title=The Complete Nonsense Book |date=1912 |publisher=Duffield & Company |location=New York |oclc=1042550888 |url=https://archive.org/details/completenonsense01lear |pages=[https://archive.org/details/completenonsense01lear/page/420 420]-421}}</ref>
|source=Stanza 8 (lines 29–32)}}

Five of Lear's limericks from the ''Book of Nonsense'', in the 1946 Italian translation by [[Carlo Izzo]], were set to music for choir a cappella by [[Goffredo Petrassi]] in 1952.
