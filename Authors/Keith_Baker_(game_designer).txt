Steve Haske, for ''[[Inverse (website)|Inverse]]'', wrote: "Last year, the bandâ€™s [[Chris Funk]] got in touch with Portland-based Twogether Studios, in order to bring ''Illimat'' into the real world via a Kickstarter campaign. With game designer Keith Baker (co-founder of Twogether), the two designed a relatively simple game played with cards, a few tokens, and a rotating box â€” the Illimat itself, that changes the 'seasons' of the gameplay â€” so appropriate to The Decemberistsâ€™s old-world aesthetic that it has a fascinating sense of authenticity".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/23178-illimat-card-game-decemberists-keith-baker|title='Illimat' Feels Like a Lost Relic of Old World Europe|last=Haske|first=Steve|website=Inverse|language=en|access-date=2019-11-19}}</ref>
