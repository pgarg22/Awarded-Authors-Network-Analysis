His poetic style combines simplicity and elegance in exploring themes of love, eroticism, feminism, religion, and [[Arab nationalism]]. Qabbani is one of the most revered contemporary poets in the [[Arab world]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-nizar-qabbani-1161210.html|work=[[The Independent]]|date=5 May 1998|title=Obituary: Nizar Qabbani|first=Adel |last=Darwish}}</ref><ref>"Nizar Qabbani: From Romance to Exile”, Muhamed Al Khalil, 2005, A dissertation submitted to the faculty of the Department of Near Eastern Studies in partial ulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in the Graduate College of the University of Arizona, USA.</ref> and is considered to be Syria's [[National Poet]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Nizar Qabbani|url=https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195390155/obo-9780195390155-0272.xml|access-date=2021-06-30|website=obo|language=en}}</ref>

==Biography==

===Early life===
[[File:Nizar Kabbani - 1935.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Qabbani as a youth.]]

Nizar Qabbani was born in the Syrian capital of [[Damascus]] to a middle class merchant family. His mother, ''Faiza Akbik'', is of Turkish descent. Qabbani was raised in ''Mi'thnah Al-Shahm'', one of the neighborhoods of Old Damascus and studied at the National Scientific College School in [[Damascus]] between 1930 and 1941.<ref name=AUB>{{cite web | url =http://ddc.aub.edu.lb/projects/cames/interviews/qabbani/html/english-biography.html | title =Biographical notes on Nizar Qabbani | access-date =23 June 2007 | publisher =[[American University of Beirut]] | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20181214122643/http://ddc.aub.edu.lb/projects/cames/interviews/qabbani/html/english-biography.html | archive-date =14 December 2018 | url-status =dead }}</ref> The school was owned and run by his father's friend, Ahmad Munif al-Aidi. He later studied law at [[Damascus University]], which was called Syrian University until 1958. He graduated with a [[LLB|bachelor's degree in law]] in 1945.<ref name=AUB/>

While a student in college he wrote his first collection of poems entitled ''The Brunette Told Me'', which he published in 1942.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Loya|first=Arieh|date=1975|title=Poetry as a Social Document: The Social Position of the Arab Woman as Reflected in the Poetry of Nizar Qabbani|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/162754|journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies|volume=6|issue=4|pages=481–494|doi=10.1017/S0020743800025381|jstor=162754|hdl=2152/24105|issn=0020-7438|hdl-access=free}}</ref> It was a collection of romantic verses that made several startling references to a woman's body, sending shock waves throughout the conservative society in Damascus.<ref name=AUB/> To make it more acceptable, Qabbani showed it to [[Munir al-Ajlani]], the minister of education who was also a friend of his father and a leading nationalist leader in Syria. Ajlani liked the poems and endorsed them by writing the [[preface]] for Nizar's first book.

[[File:Nizar Kabbani - 1944.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Qabbani as a law student in Damascus, 1944.]]

===Diplomatic career===
After graduating from law school, Qabbani worked for the Syrian Foreign Ministry, serving as Consul or cultural attaché in several capital cities, including [[Beirut]], [[Cairo]], [[Istanbul]], Madrid, and London. In 1959, when the [[United Arab Republic]] was formed, Qabbani was appointed Vice-Secretary of the UAR for its embassies in China. He wrote extensively during these years and his poems from China were some of his finest. He continued to work in diplomacy until he tendered his resignation in 1966. By that time, he had established a publishing house in Beirut, which carried his name.

== Poetic influences ==
When Qabbani was 15, his sister, who was 25 at the time, committed suicide because she refused to marry a man she did not love.<ref name=poemhunter>{{cite web | url =http://www.poemhunter.com/nizar-qabbani/biography/ | title =Nizar Qabbani| access-date =23 June 2007 | publisher =PoemHunter.com}}</ref> During her funeral he decided to fight the social conditions he saw as causing her death. When asked whether he was a revolutionary, the poet answered: “Love in the Arab world is like a prisoner, and I want to set (it) free. I want to free the Arab soul, sense and body with my poetry. The relationships between men and women in our society are not healthy.” He is known as one of the most [[feminism|feminist]] and progressive intellectuals of his time.<ref name=poemhunter/>

The city of [[Damascus]] remained a powerful [[muse]] in his poetry, most notably in the ''Jasmine Scent of Damascus''.<ref name=poemhunter/> The 1967 [[Six-Day War]] also influenced his poetry and his lament for the Arab cause.<ref name=poemhunter/><ref name=CNNdeath/> The defeat marked a qualitative shift in Qabbani's work – from erotic love poems to poems with overt political themes of rejectionism and resistance.<ref name=poemhunter/> For instance, his poem ''Marginal Notes on the Book of Defeat'', a stinging self-criticism of Arab inferiority, drew anger from both the right and left sides of the Arab political dialogue.

== Personal life ==
[[File:Nizar Kabbani - 1948.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Qabbani with his family, his parents and brothers.]]

===Family===
Qabbani had two sisters, Wisal and Haifa; he also had three brothers: Mu'taz, Rashid, and Sabah. The latter, [[Sabah Qabbani]], was the most famous after Nizar, becoming director of Syrian radio and TV in 1960 and Syria's ambassador to the United States in the 1980s.

Nizar Qabbani's father, Tawfiq Qabbani, was Syrian while his mother was of Turkish descent. His father had a chocolate factory; he also helped support fighters resisting the [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon]] and was imprisoned many times for his views, greatly affecting the upbringing of Nizar into a revolutionary in his own right. Qabbani's grandfather, [[Abu Khalil Qabbani]], was one of the leading innovators in [[Arabic literature|Arab dramatic literature]].

The family name, Qabbani, is derived from Qabban ({{lang-ar|قبان}}) which means [[Steelyard balance]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.almaany.com/ar/dict/ar-ar/%D9%82%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%86/ |script-title=ar:تعريف و معنى قبان في معجم المعاني الجامع – معجم عربي عربي|work=almaany|language=ar}}</ref>

===Marriages===
Nizar Qabbani married twice in his life. His first wife was his cousin Zahra Aqbiq; together they had a daughter, Hadba, and a son, Tawfiq. Tawfiq died due to a heart attack when he was 22 years old when he was in London. Qabbani eulogized his son in the famous poem ''To the Legendary Damascene, Prince Tawfiq Qabbani''. Zahra Aqbiq died in 2007. His daughter Hadba,<ref name="wordpress.com">{{cite web |url=http://fenshop.wordpress.com/2009/04/06/testing/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=29 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530055338/http://fenshop.wordpress.com/2009/04/06/testing/ |archive-date=30 May 2009 }}</ref> born in 1947, was married twice, and lived in London until her death in April 2009.<ref name="wordpress.com"/>

His second marriage was to an [[Iraqis|Iraqi woman]] named Balqis al-Rawi, a schoolteacher he met at a poetry recital in [[Baghdad]]; she was killed in the [[1981 Iraqi embassy bombing]] in [[Beirut]] during the [[Lebanese Civil War]] on 15 December 1981.<ref name=AUB/><ref name=poemhunter/> Her death had a severe psychological effect on Qabbani; he expressed his grief in his famous poem ''Balqis'', blaming the entire Arab world for her death. Together they had a son, Omar, and a daughter, Zainab. After the death of Balqis, Qabbani did not marry again.

==Late life and death==
After the death of Balqis, Qabbani left Beirut. He was moving between [[Geneva]] and Paris, eventually settling in London, where he spent the last 15 years of his life.<ref name=poemhunter/> Qabbani continued to write poems and raise controversies and arguments. Notable controversial poems from this period in his life include ''When Will They Announce the Death of Arabs?'' and ''Runners''.

In 1997, Nizar Qabbani suffered from poor health and briefly recovered from his sickness in late 1997.<ref name=Arnews>{{cite web | url =http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/971215/1997121521.html | title =Qabbani Recovered from Sickness, Gratitude Message to Syrians | access-date =23 June 2007 | date =15 December 1997 | publisher =Arabic News | url-status =dead | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070930211755/http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/971215/1997121521.html | archive-date =30 September 2007 | df =dmy-all }}</ref> A few months later, at the age of 75, Nizar Qabbani died in London on 30 April 1998 of a heart attack.<ref name=CNNdeath>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/books/news/9804/30/qabbani.obit/ |title=Nizar Qabbani, Major Arab Literary Figure, Dies |access-date=23 June 2007 |date=30 April 1998 |publisher=CNN |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050525190025/http://www.cnn.com/books/news/9804/30/qabbani.obit/ |archive-date=25 May 2005 }}</ref> In his will, which he wrote in his hospital bed in London, Nizar Qabbani wrote that he wished to be buried in Damascus, which he described in his [[Will and testament|will]] as "the womb that taught me poetry, taught me creativity and granted me the alphabet of Jasmine."<ref name=Arnewsdeath>{{cite web | url =http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/980504/1998050402.html | title =Nizar Qabbani: Pioneer of Modern Arab Poetry | access-date =23 June 2007 | date =4 May 1998 | publisher =Arabic News | url-status =dead | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070930200955/http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/980504/1998050402.html | archive-date =30 September 2007 | df =dmy-all }}</ref> Nizar Qabbani was buried in Damascus four days later in [[Bab al-Saghir]].<ref name=Arnewsdeath/> Qabbani was mourned by Arabs all over the world, with news broadcasts highlighting his illustrious literary career.<ref name=Arnewsdeath/>
