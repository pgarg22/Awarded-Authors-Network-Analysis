{{nihongo|'''Nishiyama Sōin'''|西山 宗因|extra=born '''Nishiyama Toyoichi''' (西山 豊一) March 28, 1605 in [[Higo Province]], Japan &ndash; May 5, 1682 in [[Kyoto]]}} was a ''[[Renku|haikai-no-renga]]'' poet of the early [[Tokugawa period]]. 

[[R H Blyth]] called Sōin "one of the Fathers of Haiku".<ref>R H Blyth, ''A History of Haiku Vol I'' (1963) p. 82</ref>

==Influence and importance==
Sōin founded the [[Danrin school]] of haikai poetry, which aimed to move away from the serious 'bookishness' popular in Japanese poetry at the time and become more in touch with the common people, infusing a spirit of greater freedom into their poetry. Their poems explored the [[Ukiyo|floating world]] of popular urban amusements in a fully colloquial style.<ref>Nobuyuki Yuasa trans., ''The Narrow Road to the Deep North'' (1983) p. 17-8</ref>

Sōin's [[Renku|haikai]] (comical [[renga]]) became the transition between the light and clever haikai of [[Matsunaga Teitoku]] and the more serious and aesthetic renku of [[Matsuo Bashō]].<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nishiyama-Soin Soin]</ref>

===Disciples===
Among the most important members of his school were Ichū, a versatile figure who also painted and wrote [[Waka (poetry)|waka]], and [[Saikaku]].<ref>L Zolbrod, ''Haiku Painting'' (1982) p. 7</ref>
