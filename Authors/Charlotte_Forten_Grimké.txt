'''Charlotte Louise Bridges Forten Grimké''' (August 17, 1837 – July 23, 1914) was an [[African-American|African American]] [[abolitionism in the United States|anti-slavery activist]], [[poet]], and [[educator]]. She grew up in a prominent abolitionist family in [[Philadelphia]]. She taught school for years, including during the Civil War, to [[freedmen]] in [[South Carolina]]. Later in life she married [[Francis James Grimké]], a [[Presbyterian]] minister who led a major church in [[Washington, DC]], for decades. He was a nephew of the abolitionist [[Grimké sisters]] and was active in civil rights.

Her diaries written before the end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] have been published in numerous editions in the 20th century and are significant as a rare record of the life of a free black woman in the [[wiktionary:antebellum|antebellum]] North.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=PBS Online: Only A Teacher: Schoolhouse Pioneers, Charlotte Forten|url=https://www.pbs.org/onlyateacher/charlotte.html|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2021-02-01|website=PBS, KQED}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Forten, known as "Lottie," was born on August 17, 1837, in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], to Mary Virginia Wood (1815 – 1840) and Robert Bridges Forten (1813 – 1864).<ref name=":1" />

=== Paternal family lineage ===
Her father Robert Forten and his brother-in-law [[Robert Purvis]] were [[abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] and members of the Philadelphia Vigilance Committee, an anti-slavery network that rendered assistance to escaped [[slaves]]. Her paternal grandfather, the wealthy sailmaker [[James Forten]] Sr., was an early [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] in Philadelphia.<ref name="Julie Winch 2002">Julie Winch, ''A Gentleman of Color: The Life of James Forten'', New York: Oxford University Press, 2002, 279–80.</ref>

Her paternal aunts –  [[Margaretta Forten]], [[Sarah Louisa Forten Purvis]], and [[Harriet Forten Purvis]] – and her paternal grandmother, [[Charlotte Vandine Forten]], were all founding members of the [[Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society]].

=== Maternal family lineage ===
While the Fortens were free northern blacks, Charlotte's mother, Mary Virginia Wood, had been born into slavery in the south. She was the daughter of wealthy planter James Cathcart Johnston<ref name="maillard" /><ref>Martha M. Smith, [http://ncpedia.org/biography/johnston-james-cathcart "Johnston, James Cathcart"], NCpedia, 1988.</ref> of [[Hayes Plantation]], Edenton, North Carolina, and the granddaughter of Governor [[Samuel Johnston]] of North Carolina.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Robbins|first1=Hollis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QqdEDAAAQBAJ|title=The Portable Nineteenth-Century African American Women Writers|last2=Gates|first2=Henry Louis|date=2017-07-25|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-14-313067-3|location=|pages=129|language=en}}</ref>

Charlotte's maternal grandmother, Edith "Edy" Wood (1795 – 1846) was the slave of Captain James Wood, owner of the Eagle Inn and Tavern in [[Hertford, North Carolina|Hertford]], [[Perquimans County, North Carolina|Perquimans County]], [[North Carolina]].<ref name="Julie Winch 2002" /><ref name="maillard" /> Edy Wood and the wealthy planter James Cathcart Johnston carried on a longstanding relationship and had four daughters: Mary Virginia, Caroline (1827 – 1836), Louisa (1828 – 1836), and Annie E. (1831 – 1879).<ref name="maillard" /><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=Maillard|first=Mary|date=|title=Mary Virginia Wood (Forten) (1815-1840)|url=https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/mary-virginia-wood-forten-1815-1840/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2021-02-01|website=Black Past|language=en-US}}</ref>

Johnston emancipated Edy and their children in 1832 and settled them in Philadelphia in 1833<ref name=":1" /> where they rented a Pine Street home for two years from [[Sarah Allen (missionary)|Sarah Allen]], widow of [[Richard Allen (bishop)|Richard Allen]] of Philadelphia's [[Mother Bethel A.M.E. Church]].<ref name="maillard" /> From 1835 through 1836, Edy Wood and her children boarded with Elizabeth Willson, mother of Joseph Willson, author of ''Sketches of Black Upper Class Life in Antebellum Philadelphia''.<ref name="maillard" />

=== Woods–Forten marriage and family life ===
After Mary Virginia Wood's 1836 marriage to Robert B. Forten, her mother Edy joined the Forten household and paid board to her son-in-law.<ref name="maillard">Mary Maillard, "'Faithfully Drawn from Real Life:' Autobiographical Elements in Frank J. Webb's The Garies and Their Friends," ''Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography'' 137.3 (2013): 265–271.</ref> When Mary died of [[tuberculosis]] in 1840, Edy continued to care for her grandchild Charlotte alongside Charlotte's young aunt, Annie Wood, who was only six years older. Upon Edy Wood's death in 1846, Charlotte was raised by various members of the Forten-Purvis family, while her aunt Annie moved to the [[Cassey House]], where she was adopted by Amy Matilda Cassey.<ref name="maillard" /><ref>Janine Black, [http://www.blackpast.org/aah/cassey-amy-matilda-williams-1808-1856 "Cassey, Amy Matilda Williams 1808–1856"], ''BlackPast''.</ref>

In 1854, Forten joined the household of Amy Matilda Cassey and her second husband, [[Charles Lenox Remond]], in [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], [[Massachusetts]], where she attended the Higginson Grammar School, a private academy for young women.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=2007-04-19|title=Charlotte Forten, Women In Education: Teacher Of Emancipated Slaves|url=https://www.womenhistoryblog.com/2007/04/charlotte-forten.html|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2021-02-01|website=History of American Women|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=2005-03-06|title=Charlotte Forten Grimke biography|url=http://www.lkwdpl.org/wihohio/grim-cha.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050306212200/http://www.lkwdpl.org/wihohio/grim-cha.htm|archive-date=2005-03-06|access-date=2021-02-01|website=Women in History}}</ref> She was the only non-white student in a class of 200.<ref name=":2" /> The school offered classes in history, geography, drawing, and cartography, with special emphasis placed on critical thinking skills.

==Activism==
Forten became a member of the Salem Female Anti-Slavery Society, where she was involved in [[coalition]] building and fund-raising. She proved to be influential as an activist and leader on civil rights.

Forten occasionally spoke to public groups on abolitionist issues. In addition, she arranged for lectures by prominent speakers and writers, including [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and Senator [[Charles Sumner]]. Forten was acquainted with many other anti-slavery proponents, including [[William Lloyd Garrison]], editor of ''[[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|The Liberator]],'' and the orators and activists [[Wendell Phillips]], [[Maria Weston Chapman]] and [[William Wells Brown]].

In 1892, Forten, [[Helen Appo Cook]], Ida B. Bailey, [[Anna J. Cooper|Anna Julia Cooper]], [[Mary Jane Patterson]], [[Mary Church Terrell]], and Evelyn Shaw formed the [[Colored Women's League]] in Washington, D.C.  The goals of the service-oriented club were to promote unity, social progress, and the best interests of the African American community.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=Jessie Carney |title=Notable Black American women. |date=1992 |publisher=Gale Research Inc. |page=123 |edition=v1 |language=English |chapter=Josephine Beall Bruce|oclc=34106990 }}</ref> In 1896, Forten assisted in starting the [[National Association of Colored Women's Clubs|National Association of Colored Women]].<ref name=":0" /> Forten stayed active in activist circles until her death.<ref name=":0" />

==Teaching career==
In 1856, finances forced Forten to take a teaching position at Epes Grammar School in Salem.<ref name=":4" /> She was well received as a teacher but returned to Philadelphia after two years due to [[tuberculosis]]. At this point, Forten began writing poetry, much of which was activist in theme.<ref>[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/charlotte-l-forten-grimkae Bio: "Charlotte L. Forten Grimke"], Poetry Foundation</ref> Her poetry was published in ''The Liberator'' and ''Anglo African'' magazines.

During the American Civil War, Forten was the first black teacher to join the mission to the South Carolina Sea Islands known as the [[Port Royal Experiment]]. The Union allowed Northerners to set up schools to begin teaching freedmen who remained on the islands, which had been devoted to large plantations for cotton and rice.

Forten was the first African American to teach at the Penn School (now the Penn Center) on St. Helena's Island, South Carolina. The school was initially founded to teach enslaved African-American children and eventually African-American children freed during the U.S. Civil War. The Union forces divided the land, giving freedmen families plots to work independently. Forten worked with many freedmen and their children on [[Saint Helena Island (South Carolina)|St. Helena Island]]. During this time, she resided at [[Seaside Plantation]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Seaside Plantation, Beaufort County (S.C. Sec. Rd. 77, St. Helena Island)|url=http://www.nationalregister.sc.gov/beaufort/S10817707027/index.htm|work=National Register Properties in South Carolina|publisher=South Carolina Department of Archives and History|access-date=25 February 2014}}</ref> She chronicled this time in her essays, entitled "Life on the Sea Islands," which were published in ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' in the May and June issues of 1864.<ref>Charlotte Forten, [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1864/05/life-on-the-sea-islands/308758/ "Life on the Sea Islands: A young black woman describes her experience teaching freed slaves during the Civil War"], ''Atlantic Monthly'', Vol. 13, No. 79, May 1864.</ref> Forten struck up a deep friendship with [[Robert Gould Shaw]], the Commander of the all-black [[54th Massachusetts Regiment]] during the Sea Islands Campaign. She was present when the 54th stormed Fort Wagner on the night of July 18, 1863. Shaw was killed in the battle, and Forten volunteered as a nurse to the surviving members of the 54th.

Following the war in the late 1860s, she worked for the [[U.S. Treasury Department]] in [[Washington, DC]], recruiting teachers. In 1872, Forten taught at Paul Laurence Dunbar High School. One year later, she became a clerk in the Treasury Department.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/people/charlotte-forten-grimke.htm|title=Charlotte Forten Grimké (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov|language=en|access-date=2019-04-13}}</ref>

==Marriage and family==
[[File:Lottie Grimke.jpg|thumb|Charlotte L. Forten Grimké, 1870s]]
In December 1878, Forten married [[Presbyterian]] minister [[Francis James Grimké|Francis J. Grimké]], pastor of the prominent Fifteenth Street Presbyterian Church in [[Washington, D.C.]], a major African-American congregation.<ref name=":3" /> He was a [[mixed-race]] nephew of white abolitionists [[Grimké sisters|Sarah and Angelina Grimké]] of South Carolina. Francis and his brother [[Archibald Grimké]] were the sons of Henry Grimké and Nancy Weston (a woman of color). At the time of their marriage, Forten was 41 years old and Grimké was 28.

On January 1, 1880, Charlotte and Francis' daughter Theodora Cornelia Grimké was born, but the child died less than five months later.

Charlotte Forten Grimké assisted her husband in his ministry, helping create important networks in the community, including providing charity and education. Many church members were leaders in the African-American community in the capital. She organized a women's missionary group and focused on "racial uplift" efforts.

When Francis' brother Archibald Grimke was appointed as U.S. consul in the [[Dominican Republic]] (1894–98), Francis and Charlotte cared for his daughter [[Angelina Weld Grimké]], who lived with them in the capital. Angelina Grimké later became an author in her own right.

Details of Charlotte Forten Grimké's health and travels during the 1880s and 1890s are documented in the recently discovered letters of Louisa M. Jacobs, daughter of fugitive-slave-narrative author [[Harriet Ann Jacobs]].<ref name="Maillard2017">{{cite book|author=Mary Maillard|title=Whispers of Cruel Wrongs: The Correspondence of Louisa Jacobs and Her Circle, 1879–1911|url=https://uwpress.wisc.edu/books/5550.htm|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|date= 2017|isbn=978-0-299-31180-3}}</ref>

==Writings==
Charlotte Forten Grimké's last literary effort was in response to ''The Evangelist'' editorial, "Relations of Blacks and Whites: Is There a Color Line in New England?" It asserted that blacks were not discriminated against in [[New England]] society.  Forten Grimké responded that black Americans achieved success over extraordinary social odds, and they simply wanted fair and respectful treatment.<ref>Ray Billington, ed., ''The Journal of Charlotte Forten: A Free Negro in the Slave Era'', New York: Norton, 1981.</ref>

Charlotte Forten Grimké was a regular journal writer until she returned north after teaching in South Carolina. After her return, her entries were less frequent, although she wrote about her daughter's death and her busy life with her husband. Her journals are a rare example of documents detailing the life of a free black female in the antebellum North.<ref name=":3" /><ref name="ReferenceA"/>

In her diary on December 14, 1862, Forten made a reference to "[[Depression (mood)|the blues]]" as a sad or depressed state of mind. She was teaching in South Carolina at the time and wrote that she came home from a church service "with the blues" because she "felt very lonesome and pitied myself." She soon got over her sadness and later noted certain songs, including one called ''Poor Rosy'', that were popular among the slaves. Forten admitted that she could not describe the manner of singing but she did write that the songs "can't be sung without a full heart and a troubled spirit." Those conditions inspired countless blues songs and could be described as the essence of blues singing.<ref>Paul Oliver (1969), ''The Story of the Blues'', London: Barrie & Rockliff, p. 8.</ref>
