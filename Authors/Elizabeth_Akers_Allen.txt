'''Elizabeth Akers Allen''' ([[pen name]], '''Florence Percy'''; October 9, 1832 – August 7, 1911), was an American poet and journalist. Her early poems appeared over the signature of "Florence Percy", and many of them were first published in the ''Portland Transcript''. She came to [[Portland, Maine|Portland]], [[Maine]] in 1855, and a volume of her fugitive poems appeared in that city just before her marriage to [[Benjamin Paul Akers|Paul Akers]], the sculptor, whom she accompanied to Italy, and buried there. For several years, she was on the editorial staff of the ''Portland Advertiser''. She wrote for most of the leading magazines, and several editions of her collected poems were published. She later resided in [[Ridgewood, New Jersey]] for several years.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=yAcTAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA161 "Elizabeth Akers Allen"] in ''The Magazine of Poetry, Volume 6'', p. 161. Accessed November 17, 2017. "After making their home in Ridgewood, N. J., for several years, she has recently removed to New York, and is engaged in literary work."</ref>{{sfn|Griffith|1888|p=74}}

==Early life==
Elizabeth Anne Chase was born in 1832 in [[Strong, Maine|Strong]], Maine.<ref name=britannica/>{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=18}} Her mother died when she was an infant,{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=18}} and her father moved the family to [[Farmington, Maine|Farmington]], where she attended [[Farmington Academy]].<ref name=britannica/>

Her earliest poems are said to have been published when she was between 12 and 15 years old, under the pen name "Florence Percy".<ref name=britannica/>{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=18}}{{sfn|Leonard|Marquis|1908|p=17}}

==Career==
In 1855, using her pen name, she published her first book of poetry, ''Forest Buds from the Woods of Maine''.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=18}} She started contributing poems to the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' in 1858.<ref name=britannica/> In 1866, she published her second collection, ''Poems'', under the name of "Elizabeth Akers".{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=18}} All subsequent volumes were published under the name "Elizabeth Akers Allen".

For much of her career, Allen earned her living partly as a journalist. The success of her first book allowed her to travel in Europe in 1859–60.<ref name=britannica/>{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=18}} While in Europe she served as a correspondent for the ''Portland Transcript'' and the ''Boston Evening Gazette''.<ref name=britannica/>  In 1874, she moved to Portland, Maine, where she spent seven years as the literary editor of the ''Daily Advertiser.''<ref name=britannica/> She was a member of the professional women's club [[Sorosis]], which had many writer members.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=18}}

Allen is best known for the first couplet of her sentimental poem "Rock Me to Sleep, Mother" (1859), which was written during her European sojourn and first published in the <!--not the better known magazine of the same name; do not link--> ''Saturday Evening Post'' of [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. Though it is not considered her finest work, it was very popular during the [[American Civil War]]<ref name=britannica/> and quoted in the (unpublished) manuscript [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[The Mysterious Stranger|No. 44, The Mysterious Stranger]]''. For some years, Allen was forced to dispute its authorship with a number of claimants after the poem was set to music by [[Ernest Leslie]] and became a hit song.<ref name=britannica/><ref name=stoddard/><ref name=Twain>{{cite book|title=Mark Twain: The Gilded Age and Other Novels|publisher=The Library of America|page=[https://archive.org/details/gildedagelaterno0000twai/page/1053 1053]|date=2002|isbn=1-931082-10-3|url=https://archive.org/details/gildedagelaterno0000twai/page/1053}}</ref> The first couplet runs:
<blockquote>
Backward, turn backward, O time, in thy flight;<br />
Make me a child again, just for to-night.
</blockquote>

Composer [[Kate Lucy Ward]] also set Allen's poem ''Do Not Look Long at Life's Sorrow'' to music.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rUtGAQAAMAAJ&q=kate+lucy+ward+composer&pg=PA85|title=The Musical Times|date=1871|publisher=Novello|language=en}}</ref>
