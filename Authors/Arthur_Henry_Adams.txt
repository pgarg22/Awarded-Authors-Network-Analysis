'''Arthur Henry Adams''' (6 June 1872 – 4 March 1936) was a journalist and author. He started his career in New Zealand, though he spent most of it in Australia, and for a short time lived in China and London.

==Biography==

Arthur Adams was born in [[Lawrence, New Zealand]], and educated at the [[University of Otago]], where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts and began studying law. He then abandoned law to become a journalist in [[Wellington]], where he began contributing poetry to ''[[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin]]'', a Sydney periodical. He moved to Sydney in 1898, and took up a position as private secretary and literary advisor to [[James Cassius Williamson|J.C. Williamson]], a noted theatrical manager.<ref>{{cite book |editor=Wilde, William |title=Australian Poets and Their Works |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1996 }}</ref><ref name=amer>{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Adams, Arthur H.|year=1920}}</ref>

In 1900 Adams travelled to China to cover the [[Boxer Rebellion]] as a journalist for ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and several New Zealand papers. He would later return to New Zealand before moving to London in 1902, where he published several works including ''The Nazarene'' (1902) and ''London Streets'', a collection of poems (1906).<ref name=amer/> Adams returned to Australia in 1906, he took over from [[A. G. Stephens]] as editor of the ''Bulletin's'' Red Page until 1909.

In addition to his poetry, Adams wrote both plays and novels. His most successful play was ''Mrs. Pretty and the Premier'', which was produced in 1914 by the [[Melbourne Repertory Theatre]].

Adams died on 4 March 1936 in Sydney. He had married Lily Paton in 1908. She and two daughters and a son survived him.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Miller, E.
