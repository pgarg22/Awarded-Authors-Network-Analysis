==Early life==
David Hare was born and raised – first in a flat, then in a semi-detached house – in [[St Leonards-on-Sea]], [[Hastings]], [[Sussex]]<!-- Sussex was not divided into East and West until 1974 -->, the son of Agnes Cockburn (née Gilmour) and Clifford Theodore Rippon Hare, a passenger ship's [[purser]] in the Merchant Navy.<ref>The Blue Touch Paper: A Memoir, David Hare, Faber and Faber, 2015</ref> The Hare family claimed descent from the Earls of Bristol.<ref>The Blue Touch Paper: A Memoir, David Hare, Faber and Faber, 2015</ref><ref>The International Who's Who, 1991-1992, Europa Publishing, p. 660</ref><ref>About Hare: The Playwright and the Work, Richard Boon, Faber, 2003</ref><ref>Hersh Zeifman, ''David Hare a Casebook'', (London: Routledge, 1994), {{ISBN|0-8240-2579-2}}, p. xix.</ref> Hare was educated at [[Lancing College]], an [[independent school]] in Sussex, and at [[Jesus College, Cambridge]]. While at Cambridge, he was the Hiring Manager on the [[Cambridge University Amateur Dramatic Club]] Committee in 1968.<ref>ADC Theatre, Cambridge Archives</ref>

==Life and career==
Hare worked with the [[Portable Theatre Company]] from 1968 to 1971. His first play, ''[[Slag (play)|Slag]]'', was produced in 1970, the same year in which he married his first wife, Margaret Matheson; the couple had three children and divorced in 1980. He was Resident Dramatist at the [[Royal Court Theatre]], London, from 1970 to 1971, and in 1973 became resident dramatist at the [[Nottingham Playhouse]]. He co-founded the [[Joint Stock Theatre Company]] with [[David Aukin]] and [[Max Stafford-Clark]] in 1975. Hare's play ''[[Plenty (play)|Plenty]]'' was produced at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] in 1978, followed by ''A Map of the World'' in 1983, and ''[[Pravda (play)|Pravda]]'' in 1985, co-written with [[Howard Brenton]].

Hare became the Associate Director of the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] in 1984, and has since seen many of his plays produced, such as his trilogy of plays about major British institutions ''[[Racing Demon (play)|Racing Demon]]'', ''[[Murmuring Judges]]'', and ''[[The Absence of War]]''. He has also directed many other plays aside from his own works, such as ''The Pleasure Principle'' by [[Snoo Wilson]], ''[[Weapons of Happiness]]'' by Howard Brenton, and ''[[King Lear]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] for the National Theatre. He is also the author of a collection of lectures on the arts and politics called ''Obedience, Struggle, and Revolt'' (2005).<ref>[http://www.contemporarywriters.com/authors/?p=auth253 David Hare<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001174915/http://www.contemporarywriters.com/authors/?p=auth253 |date=1 October 2007 }}</ref>

Hare founded a film company called Greenpoint Films in 1982, and has written screenplays such as ''Plenty'', ''Wetherby'', ''Strapless'', and ''Paris by Night''. In December 2011, it was announced that his monologue ''[[Wall (play)|Wall]]'' about the [[Israeli West Bank barrier]] was being adapted by [[Cam Christiansen]] as a live-action/animated documentary by the [[National Film Board of Canada]];<ref name=Vlessing>{{cite news|last=Vlessing|first=Etan|title=National Film Board of Canada to Animate Israel's West Bank Barrier For Theatrical Doc|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/national-film-board-canada-animate-273705|access-date=14 December 2011|newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=14 December 2011}}</ref> originally slated for completed in 2014, ''[[Wall (2017 film)|Wall]]'' premiered at the [[Calgary International Film Festival]] in 2017.<ref>Eric Volmers, [https://calgaryherald.com/entertainment/movies/cam-christiansen-david-hare-and-the-nfb-break-down-barriers-with-animated-essay-wall "Cam Christiansen, David Hare and the NFB break down barriers with animated 'essay' Wall"]. ''[[Calgary Herald]]'', September 15, 2017.</ref> Aside from films he has also written teleplays such as, for the BBC,  ''[[Licking Hitler]]'' (1978), and, for Thames Television, ''[[Saigon: Year of the Cat]]'' (1983). In November 2012, [[The New School for Drama]] selected Hare as temporary [[Artist-in-residence]] in which he met with student playwrights about his experience in varying mediums.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newschool.edu/drama/artist-in-residence/ |title=The New School for Drama Names Sir David Hare Artist-In-Residence }}</ref>

His career is examined in the Reputations strand on ''TheatreVoice''.<ref>Assessments (2008) by Michael Billington, Richard Boon, Richard Eyre, Charles Spencer and Dominic Cavendish; [http://www.theatrevoice.com/a7-assets/uploads/audio/harecutONE.mp3 ]</ref> He is particularly well known for incisive commentary on the problems of public institutions. [[Raymond Williams]] once said, sardonically, that the public services are largely managed by the nation's "upper servants". Hare addresses this group, providing an analysis of the workings of the institutions: he is, he has said, interested in the struggle to make procedures work better - right now - not in waiting until some revolution, somehow, sometime, comes about to raze the current system altogether, to replace it with perfection.<ref>C. Sullivan, "The Present: Hare and Shrinking Government Provision", in ''Literature in the Public Service: Sublime Bureaucracy'' (2013), ch. 4.</ref>

In 1993, he sold his archive to the [[Harry Ransom Center]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://norman.hrc.utexas.edu/fasearch/findingaid.cfm?eadid=00052|title=David Hare: An Inventory of His Papers at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center|website=norman.hrc.utexas.edu|access-date=2017-03-15}}</ref> The archive consists of typescript drafts, notes, rehearsal scripts, schedules, production notes, correspondence, theatre programs, resumes, photographs, and published texts associated with Hare's plays, teleplays, screenplays, and essays, as well as foreign-language translations of Hare's works; works by other authors; personal correspondence; minutes of meetings; and Hare's English papers from [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]]. Additions were made in 1996 and 2014.

Hare's awards include the [[John Llewellyn Rhys Prize]] (1975), [[BAFTA]] Award (1979), the [[New York Drama Critics Circle Award]] (1983), the [[Berlin Film Festival]] Golden Bear (1985), the [[Olivier Award]] (1990), and the London Theatre Critics' Award (1990). In 1997, he was a member of the jury at the [[47th Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name="Berlinale 1997">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1997/04_jury_1997/04_Jury_1997.html |title=Berlinale: 1997 Juries |access-date=2012-01-07 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref> He was knighted in 1998.

He is married to the French fashion designer [[Nicole Farhi]]. In 2020, he contracted [[COVID-19]], an experience reflected in his monologue ''[[Beat the Devil (play)|Beat the Devil]]''.<ref>{{cite news|first=Arifa|last=Akbar|title=Beat the Devil review – righteous rage of David Hare's corona nightmare|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/aug/30/beat-the-devil-review-bridge-theatre-london-david-hare-ralph-fiennes|work=[[The Observer]]|location=London|date=2020-08-30|access-date=2020-09-08}}</ref>
