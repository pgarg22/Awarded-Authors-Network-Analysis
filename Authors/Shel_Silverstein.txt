==Early life==
Sheldon Allan Silverstein was born into a Jewish family in [[Chicago]] on September 25, 1930.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/short-takes/dancing-shel-silverstein |title=Dancing to Shel Silverstein |newspaper=The New York Jewish Week |date=April 28, 2014 |access-date=December 15, 2015 |author=Ted Merwin}}</ref> He grew up in the [[Logan Square, Chicago|Logan Square]] neighborhood of Chicago, where he attended [[Theodore Roosevelt High School (Chicago)|Roosevelt High School]]. He then attended the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]], from which he was expelled. He enrolled in the [[Chicago Academy of Fine Arts]], which he was attending when he was drafted into the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]; he served in Japan and Korea.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stripes.com/news/from-the-archives-shel-silverstein-stars-and-stripes-cartoonist-1.263594|title=From the archives: Shel Silverstein, Stars and Stripes cartoonist|website=Stripes.com|access-date=June 15, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://offonatangent.tumblr.com/post/9279976269/shel-silverstein-stars-stripes-interview-1968|title=Shel Silverstein Stars & Stripes Interview, 1968|website=Offonatangent.tumblr.com|access-date=June 15, 2021}}</ref>

==Career==
===Cartoons===
[[File:Shelaroundworld07.jpg|left|thumb|160px|Silverstein's ''[[Playboy]]'' travelogues, collected in 2007]]
Silverstein began drawing at age seven by tracing the works of [[Al Capp]].<ref>Studs Terkel interview, WFMT, December 12, 1963.</ref> He told ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'': "When I was a kid—12 to 14, I'd much rather have been a good baseball player or a hit with the girls, but I couldn't play ball. I couldn't dance. Luckily, the girls didn't want me. Not much I could do about that. So I started to draw and to write. I was also lucky that I didn't have anybody to copy, be impressed by. I had developed my own style; I was creating before I knew there was a [[James Thurber|Thurber]], a [[Robert Benchley|Benchley]], a [[George Price (New Yorker cartoonist)|Price]] and a [[Saul Steinberg|Steinberg]]. I never saw their work 'til I was around 30. By the time I got to where I was attracting girls, I was already into work, and it was more important to me. Not that I wouldn't rather make love, but the work has become a habit."<ref name="pw">Mercier, Jean F. "Shel Silverstein", ''Publishers Weekly'', February 24, 1975.</ref>

He was first published in the ''Roosevelt Torch,'' a student newspaper at Roosevelt University, where he studied English after leaving the Art Institute. During his time in the military, his cartoons were published in ''[[Pacific Stars and Stripes]]'', where he had originally been assigned to do layouts and [[paste-up]]. His first book ''Take Ten'', a compilation of his military ''Take Ten'' cartoon series, was published by ''Pacific Stars and Stripes'' in 1955. He later said his time in college was a waste and would have been better spent traveling around the world meeting people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.super-childrens-books.com/shel-silverstein-biography.html|title=Shel Silverstein Biography|publisher=Super Children's Books|access-date=June 10, 2012}}</ref>

After returning to Chicago, Silverstein began submitting cartoons to magazines while also selling hot dogs at Chicago ballparks. His cartoons began appearing in ''Look'', ''Sports Illustrated'' and ''This Week''.<ref name="legacy">{{cite web |url=http://www.legacyrecordings.com/Shel-Silverstein.aspx |title=Shel Silverstein's Music (Legacy Recordings) |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310192155/http://www.legacyrecordings.com/Shel-Silverstein.aspx |archive-date=March 10, 2009 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

Mass-market paperback readers across America were introduced to Silverstein in 1956 when ''Take Ten'' was reprinted by [[Ballantine Books]] as ''Grab Your Socks!'' The edition included a foreword by [[Bill Mauldin]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

In 1957, Silverstein became one of the leading cartoonists in ''[[Playboy]]'', which sent him around the world to create an illustrated travel journal with reports from far-flung locales. During the 1950s and 1960s, he produced 23 installments called "Shel Silverstein Visits..." as a feature for ''Playboy''. Employing a sketchbook format with typewriter-styled captions, he documented his own experiences at such locations as a New Jersey [[naturist community]], the [[Chicago White Sox]] training camp, San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury, Fire Island, Mexico, London, Paris, Spain and Africa. In a Swiss village, he drew himself complaining, "I'll give them 15 more minutes, and if nobody yodels, I'm going back to the hotel." These illustrated travel essays were collected by the publisher Fireside in ''Playboy's Silverstein Around the World,'' published in 2007 with a foreword by [[Hugh Hefner]] and an introduction by music journalist Mitch Myers.<ref name="tim">{{cite web|url=http://shelsilverstein.tripod.com/DrHook/dh110972.html |title=Cahill, Tim.

In a similar vein were his illustrations for [[John Sack|John Sack's]] ''[[Report from Practically Nowhere]]'' (1959), a collection of humorous travel vignettes previously appearing in ''Playboy'' and other magazines.<ref>{{cite book|author=Sack, John |author-link=John Sack |year=1959 |title=Report from Practically Nowhere |publisher=Curtis Publishing Company |location=New York |title-link=Report from Practically Nowhere }}</ref>

===="Now here's my plan..."====
[[File:Nowplansilverstein.jpg|thumb|160px|"Now here's my plan...", Silverstein's best known cartoon of the 1950s, became the title of his 1960 cartoon collection]]
  
A cartoon he made during the 1950s was featured on the cover of his next cartoon collection, titled ''Now Here's My Plan: A Book of Futilities'', which was published by [[Simon & Schuster]] in 1960. Silverstein biographer Lisa Rogak wrote:
<blockquote>The cartoon on the cover that provides the book's title would turn out to be one of his most famous and often-cited cartoons. In the cartoon, two prisoners are chained to the wall of a prison cell. Both their hands and feet are shackled. One says to the other, "Now here's my plan." Silverstein was both fascinated and distressed by the amount of analysis and commentary that almost immediately began to swirl around the cartoon. "A lot of people said it was a very pessimistic cartoon, which I don't think it is at all," he said. "There's a lot of hope even in a hopeless situation. They analyze it and question it. I did this cartoon because I had an idea about a funny situation about two guys."<ref name=rogak/></blockquote>
Silverstein's cartoons appeared in issues of ''Playboy'' from 1957 through the mid-1970s, and one of his ''Playboy'' features was expanded into ''[[Uncle Shelby's ABZ Book]]'' (Simon & Schuster, 1961), his first book of new, original material for adults. Because it was unclear whether some of the material was intended for adults or children, the 1985 reprint had a conspicuous cover label.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

===Music===
[[File:Grabsocks56.jpg|thumb|160px|left|[[Ballantine Books]] published Silverstein's 1956 collection of cartoons from ''[[Pacific Stars and Stripes]]'', foreword by [[Bill Mauldin]]]]
Silverstein studied briefly at [[Chicago College of Performing Arts]] at Roosevelt University. His musical output included a large catalog of songs; a number of them were hits for other artists, most notably the rock group [[Dr. Hook & The Medicine Show]].<ref name="tim"/> He wrote [[Tompall Glaser|Tompall Glaser's]] highest-charting solo single "Put Another Log on the Fire", "[[One's on the Way]]" and "[[Hey Loretta]]" (both hits for [[Loretta Lynn]], in 1971 and 1973 respectively), and "[[25 Minutes to Go]]", sung by [[Johnny Cash]], about a man on [[Death Row]] with each line counting down one minute closer. Silverstein also wrote Cash's biggest hit, "[[A Boy Named Sue]]" as well as "[[The Unicorn (song)|The Unicorn]]", first recorded by Silverstein  in 1962 but better known in its version by [[The Irish Rovers]]. Other songs co-written by Silverstein include "The Taker" written with [[Kris Kristofferson]] and recorded by [[Waylon Jennings]], and a sequel to "A Boy Named Sue" titled "Father of a Boy Named Sue", which is less known, but he performed the song on television on ''[[The Johnny Cash Show (TV series)|The Johnny Cash Show]]''. He also penned a lesser known song titled "F**k 'em."<ref name="Thomas 2013">{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2013/10/my_shel_silverstein_biography_can_t_quote_shel_silverstein_why.single.html|title=My Shel Silverstein biography can't quote Shel Silverstein.

He wrote the lyrics and music for most of the [[Dr. Hook & the Medicine Show]] songs on their first few albums, including "[[The Cover of Rolling Stone|The Cover of 'Rolling Stone']]", "Freakin' at the Freakers' Ball," "[[Sylvia's Mother]]", "The Things I Didn't Say" and "Don't Give a Dose to the One You Love Most".<ref name=tim/> He wrote many of the songs performed by [[Bobby Bare]], including "Rosalie's Good Eats Café", "[[The Mermaid (Shel Silverstein song)|The Mermaid]]", "The Winner", "Warm and Free", and "Tequila Sheila". He co-wrote with [[Baxter Taylor]] "[[Marie Laveau (song)|Marie Laveau]]", for which the songwriters received a 1975 BMI Award.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} The third album by [[Tompall Glaser]] contained eight songs by Silverstein and three by Silverstein and others.

Silverstein's "[[The Ballad of Lucy Jordan]]", first recorded by Dr. Hook in 1975, was re-recorded by [[Marianne Faithfull]] (1979), [[Belinda Carlisle]] (1996), and Bobby Bare (2005) and later featured in the films ''[[Montenegro (film)|Montenegro]]'' and ''[[Thelma & Louise]]''. "Queen of the Silver Dollar" was first recorded by Dr. Hook on their 1972 album ''[[Sloppy Seconds (album)|Sloppy Seconds]]'', and later by [[Doyle Holly]] (on his 1973 album ''[[Doyle Holly (album)|Doyle Holly]]''), [[Barbi Benton]] (on her 1974 album ''Barbi Doll''), [[Emmylou Harris]] (on her 1975 album ''[[Pieces of the Sky]]'') and [[Dave & Sugar]] (on their 1976 album ''Dave & Sugar'').{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Silverstein composed original music for several films and displayed a musical versatility in these projects, playing guitar, piano, saxophone and [[trombone]]. He wrote "In the Hills of Shiloh", a poignant song about the aftermath of the American Civil War, recorded by [[The New Christy Minstrels]], [[Judy Collins]], Bobby Bare, and others. The soundtrack of the 1970 film ''[[Ned Kelly (1970 film)|Ned Kelly]]'' features Silverstein songs performed by [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], and others.<ref name="legacy"/> He also co-wrote with Waylon the song 'A Long Time Ago'.

In addition, Silverstein wrote "[[Hey Nelly Nelly]]," a 1960s-era folk song recorded by [[Judy Collins]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pollock|first1=Bruce|title=By the Time We Got to Woodstock: The Great Rock 'n' Roll Revolution of 1969|date=2009|publisher=Backbeat Books|page=232}}</ref>

Silverstein had a popular following on [[Dr. Demento|Dr. Demento's]] radio show. Among his better-known comedy songs were "Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout (Would Not Take the Garbage Out)", "The Smoke-Off" (a tale of a contest to determine who could roll—or smoke—marijuana joints faster), "I Got Stoned and I Missed It" and "Stacy Brown Got Two." He wrote "The Father of a Boy Named Sue", in which he tells the story from the original song from the father's point of view, and the 1962 song "[[Boa Constrictor (song)|Boa Constrictor]]", sung by a person who is being swallowed by a snake (recorded by the folk group [[Peter, Paul, and Mary]]) as well as recorded by [[Johnny Cash]] for his 1966 album ''[[Everybody Loves a Nut]]''.

One of the latter musical projects Silverstein completed in his lifetime was ''[[Old Dogs]]'', a 1998 album with songs about getting old, all of which Silverstein wrote or co-wrote.<ref name="olddogsallmusic">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p352588|pure_url=yes}} |title=The Old Dogs biography |access-date=2008-06-30 |last=Ankeny |first=Jason |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref>

A longtime friend of singer-songwriter Pat Dailey, Silverstein collaborated with him on the posthumously released ''Underwater Land'' album (2002). It contains 17 children's songs written and produced by Silverstein and sung by Dailey (with Silverstein joining him on a few tracks). The album features art by Silverstein.<ref>{{cite web|last=Silverstein|first=Shel|date=June 1, 2009|title=Underwater Land|publisher=Olympia Records|url=http://www.underwaterland.com|access-date=April 23, 2017}}</ref>

He was a friend of Chicago songwriter [[Steve Goodman]], for whom he wrote the final verse of "What Have You Done For Me Lately?" (refusing a songwriting credit for his contribution). Goodman also recorded Silverstein's "Three-Legged Man", as did [[Ray Stevens]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

In 2010, Bobby Bare and his son Bobby Bare Jr produced a CD called ''Twistable, Turnable Man: A Musical Tribute to the Songs of Shel Silverstein'' which was released on Sugar Hill Records.

A production of ''An Adult Evening of Shel Silverstein'' was produced by a Hofstra University theater group named The Spectrum Players, founded by [[Francis Ford Coppola]] in 1959. The production used a "victorian sailors on shore leave watching a play" aesthetic and used live [[rag-time]] and a character of an emcee not in the script to transition between pieces. The production was directed by Richard Traub of Chicago and starred several of Hofstra's most promising young actors: Nick Pacifico, Amanda Mac, Mike Quattrone, Ross Greenberg, Chelsea Lando, Allie Rightmeyer, and Paolo Perez as the MC.<ref name="AlexBack">{{cite web |title=Alexandra Rightmayer |url=https://www.backstage.com/u/AlexandraRightmeyer/ |website=backstage |publisher=Backstage |access-date=July 24, 2019}}</ref>

==Views on his own writing==
[[Ursula Nordstrom]], Silverstein's editor at Harper & Row, encouraged Silverstein to write children's poetry. Silverstein said that he had never studied the poetry of others and had therefore developed his own quirky style, laid back and conversational, occasionally employing profanity and slang. In an interview with ''Publishers Weekly'' in 1975, he was asked how he came to do children's books:

<blockquote>"I didn't," Shel said, "I never planned to write or draw for kids. It was [[Tomi Ungerer]], a friend of mine, who insisted—practically dragged me, kicking and screaming, into Ursula Nordstrom's office. And she convinced me that Tomi was right; I could do children's books." The relationship between Ursula Nordstrom and Shel Silverstein is mutually rewarding. He considers her a superb editor who knows when to leave an author-illustrator alone. Asked if he would change something he had produced on an editor's say-so, he answered with a flat "No." But he added: "Oh, I will take a suggestion for revision. I do eliminate certain things when I'm writing for children if I think only an adult will get the idea. Then I drop it, or save it. But editors messing with content? No." Had he been surprised by the astronomical record of ''[[The Giving Tree]]'', his biggest seller to date and one of the most successful children's books in years? Another emphatic no. "What I do is good," he said. "I wouldn't let it out if I didn't think it was." But ''The Giving Tree'', which has been selling steadily since it appeared almost 10 years ago and has been translated into French, is not his own favorite among his books. "I like ''Uncle Shelby's ABZ'', ''A Giraffe and a Half'', and ''Lafcadio, the Lion Who Shot Back''—I think I like that one the most."<ref name=pw/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n79-45309 |title=WorldCat |publisher=WorldCat |access-date=February 27, 2013}}</ref></blockquote>

[[Otto Penzler]], in his crime anthology ''Murder for Revenge'' (1998), commented on Silverstein's versatility:

{{quote|The phrase "Renaissance man" tends to get overused these days, but apply it to Shel Silverstein and it practically begins to seem inadequate. Not only has he produced with seeming ease country music hits and popular songs, but he's been equally successful at turning his hand to poetry, short stories, plays, and children's books. Moreover, his whimsically hip fables, beloved by readers of all ages, have made him a stalwart of bestseller lists. ''A Light in the Attic'', most remarkably, showed the kind of staying power on the ''New York Times'' chart—two years, to be precise—that most of the biggest names (John Grisham, Stephen King and Michael Crichton) have never equaled with their blockbusters. His unmistakable illustrative style is another crucial element to his appeal. Just as no writer sounds like Shel, no other artist's vision is as delightfully, sophisticatingly cockeyed. One can only marvel that he makes the time to respond so kindly to his friends' requests. In the following work, let's be glad he did. Drawing on his characteristic passion for list making, he shows how the deed is not just in the wish but in the sublimation.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}}}

This anthology was the second in a series, which also included ''Murder for Love'' (1996) and ''Murder and Obsession'' (1999). All three anthologies included Silverstein contributions. He did not really care to conform to any sort of norm, but he did want to leave his mark for others to be inspired by, as he told ''Publishers Weekly'':

<blockquote>I would hope that people, no matter what age, would find something to identify with in my books, pick up one and experience a personal sense of discovery. That's great. I think that if you're a creative person, you should just go about your business, do your work and not care about how it's received. I never read reviews because if you believe the good ones you have to believe the bad ones too. Not that I don't care about success. I do, but only because it lets me do what I want. I was always prepared for success but that means that I have to be prepared for failure too. I have an ego, I have ideas, I want to be articulate, to communicate but in my own way. People who say they create only for themselves and don't care if they are published... I hate to hear talk like that. If it's good, it's too good not to share. That's the way I feel about my work. So I'll keep on communicating, but only my way. Lots of things I won't do. I won't go on television because who am I talking to? [[Johnny Carson]]? The camera? Twenty million people I can't see? Uh-uh. And I won't give any more interviews.<ref name="pw"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2013/10/my_shel_silverstein_biography_can_t_quote_shel_silverstein_why.html |title=My Shel Silverstein biography can't quote Shel Silverstein.

Silverstein believed that written works needed to be read on paper—the correct paper for the particular work. He usually would not allow his poems and stories to be published unless he could choose the type, size, shape, color, and quality of the paper. Being a book collector, he took seriously the feel of the paper, the look of the book, the fonts, and the binding. Most of his books did not have paperback editions because he did not want his work to be diminished in any way. Silverstein's estate continues to control copyright permissions on his work and has blocked the quotations of that work in at least one biographical treatment.<ref name="Thomas 2013"/>
