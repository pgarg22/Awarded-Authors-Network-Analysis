'''Margaret Moore Kennedy''' (23 April 1896 – 31 July 1967) was an English novelist and playwright. Her most successful work, as a novel and as a play, was ''[[The Constant Nymph (novel)|The Constant Nymph]]''. She was a productive writer and several of her works were filmed. Three of her novels were reprinted in 2011.

==Family and education==
Margaret Kennedy was born in [[Hyde Park Gate]], London, the eldest of the four children of Charles Moore Kennedy (1857–1934), a barrister, and his wife Ellinor Edith Marwood (1861–1928). The novelist [[Joyce Cary]] was a cousin on her father's side.

She attended [[Cheltenham Ladies' College]], where she began writing, and then went up to [[Somerville College, Oxford]], in 1915 to read History. Other literary contemporaries at Somerville College included [[Winifred Holtby]], [[Vera Brittain]], [[Hilda Stewart Reid|Hilda Reid]], [[Naomi Mitchison]] and [[Sylvia Thompson]]. She also became close friends with the Welsh author [[Flora Forster]]. Her first publication was a history book, ''A Century of Revolution'' (1922). Kennedy was married on 20 June 1925 to the barrister David Davies (1889–1964), who later became a county-court judge and a national insurance commissioner. He was knighted in 1952. They had a son and two daughters, one of whom was the novelist Julia Birley,<ref>ODNB entry. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/34281?docPos=4 Retrieved 23 March 2011.

The novelist [[Serena Mackesy]] is her granddaughter. Kennedy died at Flora Forsters's house at [[Adderbury]], [[Oxfordshire]] on 31 July 1967.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://bestsellers.lib.virginia.edu/submissions/57 |title=Kennedy, Margaret: The Constant Nymph |author=Katisha Kersey |publisher=[[University of Virginia#Libraries |University of Virginia Library]] |access-date=19 August 2020}}</ref>

==Novels and plays==
Kennedy is best appreciated today for her second novel, ''[[The Constant Nymph (novel)|The Constant Nymph]]'', which she adapted into a highly successful [[West End theatre|West End play]] that opened at the [[Noël Coward Theatre|New Theatre]], with [[Noël Coward]] and [[Edna Best]] in September 1926. Coward was replaced by [[John Gielgud]] during the run.<ref>ODNB entry. A French translation entitled ''Tessa'' by [[Jean Giraudoux]] appeared in 1924: [https://blacklight.mse.jhu.edu/demo/?q=%22Kennedy%2C+Margaret%2C+1896-1967%22&search_field=author Retrieved 24 March 2011l.]</ref> It was also successfully filmed in [[The Constant Nymph (1928 film)|1928]] by [[Adrian Brunel]] and [[Alma Reville]], directed by Brunel and [[Basil Dean]], and starring [[Ivor Novello]], [[Mabel Poulton]] and [[Benita Hume]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Constant Nymph (1928) |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0018791/ |publisher=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=23 March 2011}}</ref> and again in [[The Constant Nymph (1933 film)|1933]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Constant Nymph (1933) |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0024998/ |publisher=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=23 March 2011}}</ref> 1938 (for television),<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Constant Nymph (1938) |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0259259/ |publisher=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=23 March 2011}}</ref> and [[The Constant Nymph (1943 film)|1943]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Constant Nymph (1943) |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035751/ |publisher=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=23 March 2011}}</ref>

Kennedy's first novel was ''The Ladies of Lyndon'' (1923). Among later successes were ''The Fool of the Family'' (1930), a sequel to ''The Constant Nymph'', and the [[psychological novel]] ''A Long Time Ago'' (1932). ''The Midas Touch'' (1938) was a ''Daily Mail'' book of the month, ''The Feast'' (1950) a [[Book of the Month Club|Literary Guild]] choice in the United States, and ''Troy Chimneys''  (1953) winner of the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]]. The darkly humorous ''The Heroes of Clone'' (1957) drew on her experience as a screenplay writer. She also published a biography of [[Jane Austen]] and a study of the art of fiction, ''Outlaws on Parnassus''.

Kennedy followed the stage success of ''The Constant Nymph'' (adapted in conjunction with Basil Dean) with three more co-written plays. The most successful was ''[[Escape Me Never (play)|Escape Me Never]]'' (1934), adapting ''The Fool of the Family'', which was also filmed twice.<ref>ODNB entry. IMDB: [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0026320/] (1935); [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039357/ Retrieved 24 March 2011.] (1947).</ref>

Of her postwar novels, ''The Feast'' (1950) introduces the disaster first and the characters who may or may not have perished in it afterwards, as in [[Thornton Wilder]]'s [[The Bridge of San Luis Rey]]. The seaside hotel annihilated by the collapse of the cliff is replete with dysfunctional characters of all ages and sizes, so providing a fine balance of suspense, sympathy and even humour. Still, it works on other levels too. Her novelist granddaughter [[Serena Mackesy]] has called it "one of the cleverest bits of metaphor-working ever."<ref>Mackesy's website: [http://www.serenamackesy.com/about.htm Retrieved 2 April 2011.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027020020/http://www.serenamackesy.com/about.htm |date=27 October 2011}}</ref> It was recently reprinted, as were ''Lucy Carmichael'' (1951) and ''The Midas Touch''.<ref>As ''The Feast'' (London: Faber, 2011). {{ISBN|978-0-571-27810-7}}; ''Lucy Carmichael'' (London: Faber, 2011) {{ISBN|978-0-571-27799-5}}; ''The Midas Touch'' (London: Faber, 2011). {{ISBN|978-0-571-27526-7}}.</ref> Her final novel, ''Not in the Calendar: The Story of a Friendship'', involves a friendship between a daughter of a wealthy family and the [[deaf]] daughter of one of their servants.

Kennedy's family donated her papers and correspondence to [[Somerville College Library]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.some.ox.ac.uk/library-it/special-collections/special-collections/ |website=some.ox.ac.uk |title=Special Collections |access-date=28 August 2018}}</ref>
