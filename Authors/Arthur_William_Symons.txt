'''Arthur William Symons''' (28 February 1865{{snd}}22 January 1945) was a British poet, critic and [[magazine editor]].

==Life==
Born in [[Milford Haven]], [[Wales]], to [[Cornwall|Cornish]] parents, Symons was educated privately, spending much of his time in France and Italy. In 1884–1886, he edited four of [[Bernard Quaritch]]'s ''Shakespeare Quarto Facsimiles'', and in 1888–1889 seven plays of the ''"[[Henry Irving]]" [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]''. He became a member of the staff of the ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenaeum]]'' in 1891, and of the ''[[Saturday Review (London)|Saturday Review]]'' in 1894,<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Symons, Arthur|volume=26|page=287}}</ref> but his major editorial feat was his work with the short-lived ''[[The Savoy (periodical)|Savoy]]''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

His first volume of verse, ''Days and Nights'' (1889), consisted of dramatic monologues. His later verse is influenced by a close study of modern French writers, of [[Charles Baudelaire]], and especially of [[Paul Verlaine]]. He reflects French tendencies both in the subject-matter and style of his poems, in their eroticism and their vividness of description.<ref name="EB1911"/> Symons contributed poems and essays to ''[[The Yellow Book]]'', including an important piece which was later expanded into ''[[The Symbolist Movement in Literature]],'' which would have a major influence on [[William Butler Yeats]] and [[T. S. Eliot]]. From late 1895 through 1896 he edited, along with [[Aubrey Beardsley]] and [[Leonard Smithers]], ''[[The Savoy (periodical)|The Savoy]]'', a literary magazine which published both art and literature. Noteworthy contributors included Yeats, [[George Bernard Shaw]], and [[Joseph Conrad]]. Symons was also a member of the [[Rhymer's Club]] founded by Yeats in 1890.<ref>Wainwright, Jeffrey, Poets on Poets, Carcarnet Press Ltd, Manchester, 1997 {{ISBN|1857543394}}</ref>

In 1892, ''The Minister's Call'', Symons's first play, was produced by the [[Independent Theatre Society]]&nbsp;– a private club&nbsp;– to avoid censorship by the [[Lord Chamberlain's Office]].<ref>[http://homepages.nildram.co.uk/~simmers/symchron.htm ''Arthur Symons: 1865–1945{{snd}}A Chronology''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008114528/http://homepages.nildram.co.uk/~simmers/symchron.htm |date=8 October 2016 }}.

In 1902, Symons made a selection from his earlier verse, published as ''Poems''. He translated from the Italian of [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]] ''The Dead City'' (1900) and ''The Child of Pleasure'' (1898), and from the French of [[Émile Verhaeren]] ''The Dawn'' (1898). To ''The Poems of [[Ernest Dowson]]'' (1905) he prefixed an essay on the deceased poet, who was a kind of English Verlaine and had many attractions for Symons.<ref name="EB1911"/> In 1909 Symons suffered a [[psychosis|psychotic]] breakdown, and published very little new work for a period of more than twenty years.  His ''Confessions: A Study in Pathology'' (1930) has a moving description of his breakdown and treatment.

In 1918, ''[[Vanity Fair (US magazine 1913–36)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine published Symons' Baudelarian essay, "The Gateway to an Artificial Paradise: The Effects of [[Hashish]] and [[Opium]] Compared." On one occasion between 1889 and 1895, [[John Addington Symonds]], [[Ernest Dowson]], and "some of Symons’ lady friends from the ballet all tried hashish during an afternoon tea given by Symons in his rooms at Fountain Court."<ref>Munro, John M., "Arthur Symons", Twayne Publishers, New York, 1969</ref>
