==Early life and education==
Follett was born on 5 June 1949 in [[Cardiff]], Wales. He was the first child of Martin Follett, a tax inspector, and Lavinia (Veenie) Follett, who went on to have two more children, Hannah and James.<ref name="wnyc">{{cite web |url=http://www.wnyc.org/shows/mam/episodes/2003/12/07 |title=Ken Follett |publisher=[[WNYC]] |date=7 December 2003 |access-date=2009-01-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201190456/http://www.wnyc.org/shows/mam/episodes/2003/12/07 |archive-date=1 December 2008}}</ref><ref name="follettbio">{{cite web |url=http://www.ken-follett.com/biography/earlyyears.html |title=The early years ... |access-date=2009-01-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124213605/http://ken-follett.com/biography/earlyyears.html |archive-date=24 January 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Barred from watching films and television by his [[Plymouth Brethren]] parents, he developed an early interest in reading but remained an indifferent student until he entered his teens.<ref name="wnyc"/><ref name="follettbio"/> His family moved to London when he was ten years old, and he began applying himself to his studies at [[Harrow Weald]] Grammar School and [[Poole]] Technical College.

He won admission in 1967 to [[University College London]], where he studied philosophy and became involved in centre-left politics. He married Mary, in 1968, and their son Emanuele was born in the same year. After graduation in the autumn of 1970, Follett took a three-month post-graduate course in journalism and went to work as a trainee reporter in Cardiff on the ''[[South Wales Echo]]''. In 1973 a daughter, Marie-Claire, was born.

==Career==
After three years in Cardiff, he returned to London as a general-assignment reporter for the ''[[Evening News (London)|Evening News]]''. Finding the work unchallenging, he eventually left journalism for publishing and became, by the late 1970s, deputy managing director of the small London publisher Everest Books.<ref name="wnyc"/> He began writing fiction during evenings and weekends as a hobby. Later, he said, he began writing books when he needed extra money to fix his car, and the publishers' advance a fellow journalist had been paid for a thriller was the sum required for the repairs.<ref name="New York Times">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/22/arts/television/22follett.html?ref=arts |work=The New York Times |title=No Money to Fix Your Car?

===Further successes===
Success came gradually at first, but the 1978 publication of ''[[Eye of the Needle (novel)|Eye of the Needle]]'', which became an international bestseller and sold over 10 million copies, made him both wealthy and internationally famous.<ref>{{cite web |title=Follett, Ken {{!}} List Of Writers |url=http://www.literaturewales.org/writers-of-wales/i/130139/desc/follett-ken/ |website=www.literaturewales.org |access-date=2016-01-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413154558/http://www.literaturewales.org/writers-of-wales/i/130139/desc/follett-ken/ |archive-date=13 April 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Each of Follett's subsequent novels has become a best-seller, ranking high on the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]]; a number have been adapted for the screen. As of January 2018, he had published 44 books.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fantastic |first1=Fiction |title=Ken Follett |url=https://www.fantasticfiction.com/f/ken-follett/ |website=www.fantasticfiction.com |access-date=2 February 2018}}</ref> The first five best sellers were spy thrillers: ''Eye of the Needle'' (1978), ''[[Triple (novel)|Triple]]'' (1979), ''[[The Key to Rebecca ]]''(1980), ''[[The Man from St. Petersburg]]'' (1982) and ''[[Lie Down with Lions]]'' (1986). ''[[On Wings of Eagles]]'' (1983) was the true story of how two of [[Ross Perot]]'s employees were rescued from Iran during the revolution of 1979.

The next three novels, ''[[Night Over Water]]'' (1991), ''[[A Dangerous Fortune]]'' (1993) and ''[[A Place Called Freedom]]'' (1995) were more historical than thriller, but he returned to the thriller genre with ''[[The Third Twin]]'' (1996) which in the ''[[Publishing Trends]]'' annual survey of international fiction best-sellers for 1997 was ranked no. 2 worldwide, after [[John Grisham]]'s ''[[The Partner (Grisham novel)|The Partner]]''. His next work, ''[[The Hammer of Eden]]'' (1998), was another contemporary suspense story followed by a [[Cold War]] thriller, ''[[Code to Zero]]'' (2000).

Follett returned to the [[Second World War]] era with his next two novels, ''[[Jackdaws (novel)|Jackdaws]]'' (2001), a thriller about a group of women parachuted into France to destroy a vital telephone exchange – which won the [[Corine Literature Prize]] for 2003 – and ''[[Hornet Flight]]'' (2002), about a daring young [[Denmark|Danish]] couple who escape to Britain from occupied Denmark in a rebuilt [[de Havilland Hornet Moth|Hornet Moth]] biplane with vital information about German radar. ''[[Whiteout (Follett novel)|Whiteout]]'' (2004) is a contemporary thriller about the theft of a deadly virus from a research lab.

===Kingsbridge series===
Follett surprised his readers with his first non-spy thriller, ''[[The Pillars of the Earth]]'' (1989), a novel about building a [[cathedral]] in a small English village during [[the Anarchy]] in the 12th century. The novel was highly successful, received positive reviews and was on the ''New York Times'' Best Seller list for 18 weeks. It topped best-seller lists in Canada, Britain and Italy, and was on the German best-seller list for six years. It has sold 26 million copies so far.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://boingboing.net/2017/08/18/interview-with-ken-follet-abou.html | title = Interview with Ken Follett about forthcoming 3rd book in Kingsbridge series: A Column of Fire | first = Mark | last = Frauenfelder | date = August 18, 2017 | work = Boing Boing | access-date = September 4, 2017}}</ref> On 16 August 2017, it was [[The Pillars of the Earth (video game)|published as a computer game adaptation]] by German developer and publisher [[Daedalic Entertainment]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://ken-follett.com/news/ | title = The Pillars of the Earth video game is out now | date = September 2017 | work = Ken Follett | access-date = September 4, 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170904104536/https://ken-follett.com/news/ | archive-date = September 4, 2017}}</ref>

It focuses on the destinies of a handful of people as their lives are devastated by the [[Black Death]], the plague that swept Europe from the middle of the 14th century.

The next novel in the series, ''[[A Column of Fire]]'',<ref name=Follet-ACoF>{{cite web | url = https://ken-follett.com/books/a-column-of-fire/ | title = A Column of Fire | date = n.d. | work = Ken Follett | access-date = November 3, 2020}}</ref> was published in September 2017.<ref name=Follet-ACoF /> Beginning in 1558, the story follows the romance between Ned Willard and Margery Fitzgerald over half a century. It commences at a time when Europe turns against [[Elizabethan England]], and the queen finds herself beset by plots to dethrone her.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/ken-follett/the-kingsbridge-novels-series | title = The Kingsbridge Novels | access-date = September 4, 2017 | work = PAN MACMILLAN | publisher = Pan Macmillan | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181216032445/https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/ken-follett/series/the-kingsbridge-novels/2839a3b6-13a6-468e-ec24-08d5ec285051 | archive-date = December 16, 2018}}</ref>

A fourth novel, ''[[The Evening and the Morning]]'' (2020), is a prequel to ''The Pillars of the Earth''. Set in the decade around 1000 AD – in the so-called [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] – the story "concerns the gradual creation of the town of Kingsbridge and of the many people — priests, nobles, peasants, the enslaved — who played significant roles."<ref name=WaPo-Sheehan>{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/ken-folletts-pillars-of-the-earth-prequel-is-just-as-transporting--and-lengthy--as-his-famous-epic/2020/09/21/0a0a18d8-f6c2-11ea-a275-1a2c2d36e1f1_story.html | title = Ken Follett's 'Pillars of the Earth' prequel is just as transporting — and lengthy — as his famous epic | first = Bill | last = Sheehan | date = September 21, 2020 | work = The Washington Post | access-date = November 3, 2020}}</ref> As such, the book provides "a solid underpinning to the later installments of the Kingsbridge series."<ref name=WaPo-Sheehan />

The series has been described as being "as comprehensive an account of the building of a civilization — with its laws, structures, customs and beliefs — as you are likely to encounter anywhere in popular fiction."<ref name=WaPo-Sheehan />

===Century trilogy===
Follett's novels, ''[[Fall of Giants]]'', ''[[Winter of the World]]'' and ''[[Edge of Eternity (novel)|Edge of Eternity]]'', make up the Century Trilogy. ''Fall of Giants'' (2010) followed the fates of five interrelated families – American, German, Russian, English and Welsh – as they moved through the world-shaking dramas of the [[First World War]], the [[Russian Revolution]] and the struggle for women's [[suffrage]]. ''Fall of Giants'', published simultaneously in 14 countries, was internationally popular and topped several best-seller lists.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ken-follett.com/downloads/biography/Ken_Follett_biography_en_1209.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-12-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202174553/http://ken-follett.com/downloads/biography/Ken_Follett_biography_en_1209.pdf |archive-date=2 February 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

''Winter of the World'' (2012) picks up where the first book left off, as its five interrelated families enter a time of enormous social, political, and economic turmoil, beginning with the rise of the [[Third Reich]], through the [[Spanish Civil War]] and the great dramas of World War II, to the explosions of the American and Soviet atom bombs and the beginning of the long Cold War.

The final novel in the 'Century' trilogy, ''Edge of Eternity'', which follows those families through the events of the second half of the 20th century, was published on 16 September 2014. Like the previous two books, it chronicles the lives of five families through the Cold War and civil-rights movements.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://svetlanalasrado.wordpress.com/2014/09/23/follett-tweaks-beststeller-formula/ |title=Follett tweaks beststeller formula |last=svetlanalasrado |date=23 September 2014 }}</ref>

A major element of the first two volumes, ''Fall of Giants'' and ''Winter of the World'', is the increasing political assertiveness of the British working class and the rise of the [[British Labour Party]] - exemplified by the Williams Family, Welsh coal miners, of which several viewpoint characters end up as Members of the British Parliament and one of becomes a cabinet minister in [[Clement Attlee]]'s post-WWII Labour government. However, the theme of British politics is nearly absent from the third part ''Edge of Eternity'', which concentrates on the Cold War on the one hand and the US Civil Rights Movement on the other; for example, though the novel continues until 1989, it makes no reference at all to the rise of [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 1979.

==Adaptations==
Follett has had a number of novels made into films and television mini series: ''Eye of the Needle'' was made into an [[Eye of the Needle (film)|acclaimed film]], starring Donald Sutherland, and six novels have been made into television mini-series: ''The Key to Rebecca'', ''Lie Down with Lions'', ''[[On Wings of Eagles (miniseries)|On Wings of Eagles]]'' (1986), ''The Third Twin'' – the rights for which were sold to CBS for $US1,400,000, a record price at the time – and ''[[The Pillars of the Earth (miniseries)|The Pillars of the Earth]]'' (2010) and ''[[World Without End (miniseries)|World Without End]]'' (2012).

A video game adaptation titled ''[[Ken Follett's The Pillars of the Earth]]'', developed and published by German studio Daedalic Entertainment, was released in three parts from 2017 to 2018.

Follett had cameo roles as the valet in ''The Third Twin'' and later as a merchant in ''The Pillars of the Earth''. In 2016, ''A Dangerous Fortune'' was also adapted.1{{cn|date=June 2021}}
