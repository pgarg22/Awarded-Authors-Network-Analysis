==Proposed serials of “''Doctor Who''” ==
'''Knight Fall'''

In May 1987, Aaronovitch submitted “Knight Fall” to the ''Doctor Who'' production office for [[Doctor Who (season 25)|Season 25]]. The story concerned privatization.<ref name=":0">''A brief history of “Doctor Who” stories-The Lost Stories-Patrick Sullivan, Shannon''</ref> Script editor [[Andrew Cartmel]] liked the story ideas, but felt that the script was inappropriate for the series and had too many supporting characters.<ref name=":0" /> Aaronovitch would write ''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]]'' as the story opener of Season 25.

'''Transit'''

After failing to feature Aaronovitch's “''Knight Fall''” storyline to production, Aaronovitch submitted a story in June 1987, entitled as “''Transit''”. The story would see the Doctor and Ace in the future, land in a metro station, and discover transportation portals that could lead any body throughout the Solar System, but one of the portals leads a gate way to hell.<ref name=":0" /> Even though it is unexplainable to how Aaronovitch's scripts of “''Transit''” never came to fruition, he would adapt the story as a book for ''[[Virgin New Adventures]]'' series in December 1992.<ref name=":0" />

'''Bad Destination'''

During Summer of 1988, Aaronovitch submitted a three-part adventure story for ''Doctor Who’s'' 27th Season (which never came to fruition), and was called ”Bad Destination”. The story would feature The Doctor seeing Ace as a captain of a hospital spaceship which is being under attack by the Metatraxi.<ref name=":1">''“Doctor Who: Endgame”- DVD documentary of [[Survival (Doctor Who)|“Doctor Who: Survival”]]- retrieved August 2007''</ref> The story, however, was abandoned when, in September 1989, the BBC cancelled ''Doctor Who'' after its [[Doctor Who (season 26)|26 Season]], due to declining audiences.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> In July 2011, [[Big Finish Productions]] released the story as [[Earth Aid]], by Aaronovitch and Cartmel.<ref name=":0" />
