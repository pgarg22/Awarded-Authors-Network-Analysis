__NOTOC__[[File:Philip_OConnor_1947.jpg|thumb|right|O'Connor in 1947]]'''Philip Marie Constant Bancroft O'Connor''' (8 September 1916 â€“ 29 May 1998) was a British writer and [[surrealist]] poet, who also painted. He was one of the 'Wheatsheaf writers' of 1930s [[Fitzrovia]] (who took their name from a pub). 

In his ''Memoirs of a Public Baby'' (1958, [[Faber and Faber]]) O'Connor wrote about his early life, which was "shrouded in a good deal of mystery and make-believe".<ref>Quentin and Philip: A Double Portrait, Andrew Barrow, Pan Books</ref> According to O'Connor, his father, Bernard, was an Oxford-educated surgeon of sophisticated tastes, descended from the last High King of Ireland; he allegedly died early in the First World War whilst serving in the Navy. Notwithstanding O'Connor's account, "neither the Admiralty, Oxford University nor the various doctors' registers are able to authenticate" what he wrote. His mother considered his father "riff-raff" and "a cad". She was Winifred Xavier Rodyke-Thompson, of an Irish Roman Catholic family; she claimed her grandfather had been born into the Spring Rice family headed by [[Baron Monteagle of Brandon]], later changing his name. During O'Connor's childhood, his mother founded the Somerset Cigarette Agency and secured a government contract to produce inferior cigarettes for supply to soldiers.<ref>Quentin and Philip: A Double Portrait, Andrew Barrow, Pan Books</ref>

''Memoirs of a Public Baby'' was followed by ''The Lower View'' (1960), ''Living in Croesor'' (1962) and ''Vagrancy'' (1963). He was a heavy drinker and (at the very least) massively eccentric, living a mainly parasitic life. In his own words, he "bathed in life and dried myself on the typewriter".

In 1963, O'Connor interviewed an acquaintance, [[Quentin Crisp]], for the [[BBC Third Programme]]. A publisher who happened to hear the broadcast was impressed by Crisp's performance, and as an indirect result of O'Connor's interview, Crisp ended up writing ''[[The Naked Civil Servant (book)|The Naked Civil Servant]]''.<ref name="peculiarly">Andrew Barrow, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20100302171005/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/3308535/A-peculiarly-outrageous-act-to-follow.html A peculiarly outrageous act to follow]", ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 11 September 2002, retrieved by the Wayback Machine on 2 March 2010.</ref>

He fathered "an unknown number of attractive and intelligent children", including Philip, Max, Sarah, Peter, John, Allaye, Patric, and Rachel, the eight children referenced in his obituary in ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref>52 McGs- The Best Obituaries from legendary New York Times writer Robert McG.
