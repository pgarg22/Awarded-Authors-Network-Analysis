'''Zona Gale''', also known by her married name, '''Zona Gale Breese''' (August 26, 1874 – December 27, 1938), was an American novelist, short story writer, and playwright. She became the first woman to win the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] in 1921. The close relationship she had with her parents set the tone for her writing and her personal life. Her books based upon her home town were found to be charming and had an intimate sense of realism, in which she captures the underlying feelings and motivations of her characters. All of her works were written under her maiden name, Zona Gale.

She became a single parent when she adopted a girl. Her parents died in 1923 and 1929. After her parents died, she became interested in mysticism, which changed her writing style, to the chagrin of the critics who had enjoyed her previous work. She was unmarried until she was in her fifties, when she married a childhood friend who was a widower. She supported political and social causes, like women's rights, pacifism, and education.

==Early life and education==
Gale was born on August 26, 1874 in [[Portage, Wisconsin]] to Charles Franklin and Eliza Beers Gale.<ref name="Champion" /><ref name="Death claims" /> She was very close to her parents, who were the inspiration for the "charming elderly couple" in her book ''The Loves of Pelleas and Etare''.<ref name="Champion">{{Cite book |last=Champion |first=Laurie |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qltu-Bw0hcUC&pg=PA119 |title=American Women Writers, 1900-1945: A Bio-bibliographical Critical Sourcebook |last2=Nelson |first2=Emmanuel Sampath |date=2000 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-313-30943-4 |pages=119, 121 |language=en}}</ref> She began writing and illustrating stories at the age of 7.<ref name="Death claims" /> Her first story was printed in pencil, because she did not know how to write yet, and the manilla pages were bound into a book that was held together by a ribbon.<ref name="Joy" />

Gale submitted a short story, "Bob", to the ''[[Milwaukee Evening Wisconsin]]'' when she was sixteen, and was paid $3 for the story.<ref name="Joy">{{Cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46712530/zona-gales-first-story-brought-3/ |title=Zona Gale's First Story Brought $3 -- And Joy |date=December 28, 1938 |work=Wisconsin State Journal |access-date=March 14, 2020 |pages=2}}</ref>{{efn|Gale received notification and the check for $3 at college.

She received a master's degree in Library Science in 1899 and another master's degree in 1901.<ref name="Essay contest" /> While a student, her poems were published in university publications.<ref name="Essay contest" /> She received an honorary degree from the University of Wisconsin in 1929.<ref name="Essay contest" />

==Career==
After college, Gale wrote for ''Milwaukee Evening Wisconsin''. She got the job by showing up at the city editor's desk each day. After two weeks, the city editor asked her to write a story about a flower show. After a total of six weeks, she was given a job on the paper.<ref name="Joy" /> In 1896, she worked for the ''[[Milwaukee Journal]].''<ref name="Essay contest" /> She went to New York City in 1901 and applied to get on every paper in the city. To get a job, she prepared a list of story ideas relevant for that day for the ''[[New York World]]'' and persisted until she got two assignments, and then a job.<ref name="Joy" />

{{quote|text=All of this was so largely sheer adventure and pioneering that none of it now seems to me to have been either will or purpose, but sheer delight.|author=Zona Gale<ref name="Joy" />}}

Hired as a secretary to [[Edmund Clarence Stedman]], she met people from his literary circle, including [[Ridgely Torrence]], with whom she would have a relationship, and [[Richard Le Gallienne]].<ref name="Essay contest" /> She returned to her hometown in 1903 and saw it in a new light that changed her direction as a writer. She found that her "old world was full of new possibilities."<ref name=wiscHist /> She returned to Portage permanently in 1904, where she wrote her stories full-time.<ref name="Champion" /><ref name=wiscHist >{{cite web|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/topics/gale/ |title=Zona Gale |publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423060505/https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/topics/gale/ |archive-date=April 23, 2014|access-date=March 14, 2020}}</ref>

She published ''Romance Island'', her first novel, in 1906, and began the popular "Friendship Village" series of stories which were thought to be based upon Portage,<ref name="Champion" /><ref name=wiscHist /> although Gale stated that Friendship Village was not based upon any one town, but typical of a small town.<ref name="Death claims" /> She won first prize, worth $2,000, in 1910 for "The Ancient Dawn" in the short fiction contest by the ''Delineator''.<ref name="Essay contest" /> In 1920, she published the novel ''[[Miss Lulu Bett (novel)|Miss Lulu Bett]]'', which depicts life in the Midwestern United States after spending time at [[Bonnie Oaks Historic District|Bonnie Oaks]].<ref name=wiscHist /> Her novel, appreciated for its realism, was compared to the works of [[Sinclair Lewis]] and [[Theodore Dreiser]].<ref name="Champion" /> She adapted it as a play, which was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] in 1921.<ref name=wiscHist /> For the time, she had a rare skill in the way she wrote about common daily experiences of ordinary people in a small town.<ref name=wiscHist /> Her early works were considered sentimental, but also, like [[Jane Austen]]'s work, in touch with the deeper meanings of her character's expressions during tea-table banter. Frederick Tabor Cooper said, "We bask for a few hours in that human exhilarating sunshine that radiates straight from the heart of people who are real and true and big of soul."<ref name="Champion" />

''Preface to Love'', published in 1926 was based on a new-found mysticism that grew after the death of her mother in 1923 and her father in 1929. The main character mistakes his inner wisdom and mysticism for madness. She published essays based upon mysticism.<ref name=wiscHist /> In these works, people's problems could be solved through a kind of [[Transcendentalism|transcendentalist enlightenment]].<ref name=wiscHist /> Critics, who did not enjoy her book and essays, viewed her work unfavorably from that point forward, even when she tried to return to realism.<ref name=wiscHist />

She wrote a book about a friend, [[Frank Augustus Miller]], the founder of the [[The Mission Inn Hotel & Spa|Mission Inn Hotel]], after his death in 1935. The biography, titled ''Frank Miller of Mission Inn'', was published in 1938.<ref name="Simonson" /> Throughout her career, she wrote under her maiden name, Zona Gale.<ref name="Death claims" />

==Political and suffrage efforts==

La Follette Jr.|Robert Jr.]] and [[Philip La Follette|Philip]].<ref name=wiscHist /><ref name="obit" /> She spoke for them at events and on the radio when they were campaigning for office.<ref name="obit" />

She was an active member of the [[National Woman's Party]], and she lobbied extensively for the 1921 [[Wisconsin Equal Rights Law]].<ref name=wiscHist /> In the same year, she attended the founding meeting (in New York) of the [[Lucy Stone League]] and became a member of its executive committee.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stannard|first=Una |year= 1977 |title=Mrs Man|publisher=Germainbooks|page=192}}{{ISBN|0-914142-02-X}}</ref> Her activism on behalf of women was her way to help solve "a problem she returned to repeatedly in her novels: women's frustration at their lack of opportunities."<ref name=wiscHist />

She became a pacifist during [[World War I]].<ref name="Essay contest" /> She was a director of the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]]. She also criticized the inclusion of military training in college curriculums. She was on the executive committee of the American Union Against Militarism and a member of the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]] and the Women's Peace Society.<ref name="Obit continued" />

She later became a regent of the university and became embroiled in the ouster of the president, Dr. [[Glenn Frank]].
