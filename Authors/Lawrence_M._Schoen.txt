==Biography==

Schoen was born in [[Chicago, Illinois]], but his family moved to Southern California when he was 18 months old, and he grew up in [[Culver City]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.lawrencemschoen.com/press-kit/|title=Press Kit|date=2011-10-12|work=Lawrence M. Schoen|access-date=2018-02-02|language=en-US}}</ref>

In 1983, he graduated with B.S. in [[psycholinguistics]] from [[California State University, Northridge]], having designed his own major, and then moved on to [[Kansas State University]] where he earned his M.S. and Ph.D. in [[psychology]]. In graduate school, Schoen's research focused on cognitive psychology and psycholinguistics.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.lawrencemschoen.com/press-kit/|title=Press Kit|date=2011-10-12|work=Lawrence M. Schoen|access-date=2018-02-02|language=en-US}}</ref>

Doctorate in hand, he spent the next ten years in academia as an assistant professor at [[New College of Florida]], [[Lake Forest College]] in Illinois, and [[Chestnut Hill College]] in Pennsylvania. He then moved to the private sector and served for about 17 years as the director of research and analytics for a medical center which provides mental health and addiction treatment service works throughout Philadelphia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.addictionpro.com/article/study-will-test-unusual-creative-format-empower-outpatients |title=Study will test unusual but creative format to empower outpatients |accessdate=2015-03-19}}</ref>

In August of 2019, Schoen was diagnosed with multiple myeloma and began treatment. The following January he underwent an autologous bone marrow transplant and entered a new regimen of chemotherapy. As of February 2021 he was in remission.

Schoen lives in [[Blue Bell, Pennsylvania]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.lawrencemschoen.com/press-kit/|title=Press Kit|date=2011-10-12|work=Lawrence M. Schoen|access-date=2018-02-02|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Author==
Schoen attended the 1998 session of [[James Gunn (author)|James Gunn]]'s two-week Writers' Workshop in Science Fiction on the campus of the [[University of Kansas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.news.ku.edu/1998/98N/JuneNews/June23/klingon.html |title=Speaker to Talk on Klingon: Sci-Fi Language Star |accessdate=2014-09-14}}</ref> In 2010, he participated in [[Walter Jon Williams]]' two-week master class, the Taos Toolbox.

He has been nominated for the [[Astounding Award for Best New Writer]], the [[Hugo Award for Best Short Story]], the [[Nebula Award for Best Novella]] three times,<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.locusmag.com/News/2013/02/2012-nebula-awards-nominees-announced/ |title=Locus Online News » 2012 Nebula Awards Nominees Announced |publisher=Locusmag.com |date=2013-02-20 |accessdate=2013-10-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.locusmag.com/News/2014/02/2013-nebula-awards-nominees-announced-2/ |title=Locus Online News » 2013 Nebula Awards Nominees Announced |publisher=Locusmag.com |date=2014-02-20 |accessdate=2014-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.locusmag.com/News/2015/02/2014-nebula-awards-ballot/ |title=Locus Online News » 2014 Nebula Awards Ballot Announced |publisher=Locusmag.com |date=2015-02-20 |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref> as well as receiving nominations for both the [[Nebula Award for Best Novel]]<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.locusmag.com/News/2016/02/2015-nebula-awards-ballot/ |title=Locus Online News » 2015 Nebula Awards Ballot |publisher=Locusmag.com |date=2016-02-21 |accessdate=2016-02-21}}</ref> and the  [[Cóyotl Award for Best Novel]].<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://coyotlawards.org/2016/04/01/final-ballot-for-2015/ |title=The Furry Writers' Guild » Final Ballot for 2015! |publisher=coyotlawards.org |date=2016-04-02 |accessdate=2016-04-02}}</ref>

Some of his more notable works as an author include the ''Amazing Conroy'' series of science fiction stories and novels, the first of which appeared in 2001,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Reviews: Absolute Magnitude, #16, Summer 2001|url=http://tangentonline.com/print--quarterly-reviewsmenu-261/absolute-magnitude-reviewsmenu-65/264-absolute-magnitude-16-summer-2001 |journal=Tangent |date=2001-06-12 |first=James S.|last=Reichert|accessdate=2013-10-21}}</ref> about a space-traveling stage hypnotist and his alien companion animal (a "buffalito") that can consume anything and farts oxygen. Among these, the short story "Yesterday's Taste"<ref>{{cite journal|title=Yesterday's Taste|publisher=Aeon Press|journal=Transtories|date=October 2011|URL=https://www.amazon.com/Transtories-Colin-Harvey-ebook/dp/B0080B6LJA/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1426305038&sr=1-1&keywords=transtories}}</ref> and the novellas ''Barry's Tale'' (2012),<ref>{{cite book|publisher=Hadley Rille Books|date=2012|title=Barry's Tale|author=Schoen, Lawrence M.}}</ref> ''Trial of the Century'' (2013),<ref>{{cite book|publisher=World Jumping|date=2013|author=Schoen, Lawrence M.|title=Trial of the Century}}</ref> and ''Calendrical Regression'' (2015)<ref>{{cite book|title=Calendrical Regression |author=Schoen, Lawrence M.| publisher= NobleFusion Press |date=January 26, 2015|asin= B00STWXR3I}}</ref> have received award nominations.

Schoen appeared at Book Expo America in May 2015, where he was presented as one of four authors described by Tor Books as the next generation of science fiction and fantasy, based on his novel ''Barsk: The Elephants' Graveyard'',  anthropomorphic SF that explores prophecy, intolerance, political betrayal, and a drug that lets one talk to the dead.

From 2015 to 2018, he was part of the staff at Orson Scott Card's ''InterGalactic Medicine Show'' as Reprint Editor, replacing Darrell Schweitzer as the magazine's interviewer.

==Klingonist==

Schoen founded the [[Klingon Language Institute]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Gorman |first=James |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,978143-2,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910021925/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,978143-2,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 10, 2008 |title=Klingon: The Final Frontier |publisher=TIME |date=1993-04-05 |accessdate=2013-10-21}}</ref> and has published Klingon translations of [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays ''[[Hamlet]]'' (''[[The Klingon Hamlet]]'', {{ISBN|978-0671035785}}) and ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' ({{ISBN|978-1587155017}}), as well as the ''[[Gilgamesh|Epic of Gilgamesh]] ''({{ISBN|978-1587153389}}) and the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'' ({{ISBN|978-0964434523}}). In the realm of Klingon nonfiction, Schoen edited and published ''The Grammarian's Desk'' (978-0964434530), a collection of essays written by Captain Krankor ([[Klingon Language Institute#Rich Yampell|Rich Yampell]]). He also served as the editor of <code>''[[HolQeD]]''</code> (ISSN 1061-2327), the quarterly journal of the KLI, for the entirety of its 13-year run. He was featured in Director [[Alexandre O. Philippe]]'s documentary about the Klingon Language Institute, ''[[Earthlings: Ugly Bags of Mostly Water]]'' (2004).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0476986/?ref_=nm_flmg_slf_1 |title=Earthlings: Ugly Bags of Mostly Water - IMDb |publisher=Us.imdb.com |date=2009-05-01 |accessdate=2014-09-06}}</ref> In 2011, he produced a daily Klingon language [[podcast]] called <code>''DaHjaj Hol''</code>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lawrencemschoen.com/category/podcasts/ |title=Lawrence M. Schoen &#124; Archive &#124; Podcasts |publisher=Lawrencemschoen.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-21}}</ref> (See [[Klingon Language Institute#Publications]].)

==Small press publisher==

Schoen is the publisher and chief editor for [[Paper Golem]], a speculative fiction small press started in November, 2006.  The first book it published was ''Prime Codex'', an anthology of previously published stories by members of the [[Codex Writers Group]], of which Schoen is a founding member.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.codexwriters.com/links.asp |title=Codex Writers' Group: Links |publisher=Codexwriters.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-21}}</ref> Paper Golem is Schoen's vehicle for "paying it forward," and focuses on two mains tracks: publishing single author collections by relatively new authors (e.g., [[Cat Rambo]] in 2009, Eric James Stone in 2011), and the ''Alembical'' series, which produces anthologies of original novellas ([[J. Kathleen Cheney]]'s novella "Iron Shoes", from ''Alembical 2'', received a nomination for the Nebula Award).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/02/nebula-award-nominations-announced |title=Nebula Award Nominations Announced! |publisher=Tor.com |date=2011-02-22 |accessdate=2013-10-21}}</ref>

==Hypnotist==

In 2013, Schoen took a page from one of his fictional creations and became certified as a hypnotherapist by the International Association of Professional Conversational Hypnotists (IAPCH), with the intention of developing materials to aid other writers grappling with problems common to their field (e.g., writer's block).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://file770.com/?p=29398|title=Lawrence Schoen on Linguistics, Hypnosis and Cuisine — With a Side of Buffalitos|date=2016-06-09|work=File 770|access-date=2018-02-02|language=en-US}}</ref>
