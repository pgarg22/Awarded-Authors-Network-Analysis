'''Hugo Maurice Julien Claus''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈɦyɣoː ˈklʌu̯s}}; 5 April 1929 – 19 March 2008) was a leading [[Belgian literature|Belgian]] author who published under his own name as well as various pseudonyms. Claus' literary contributions spanned the genres of drama, the novel, and poetry; he also left a legacy as a painter and film director. He wrote primarily in Dutch, although he also wrote some poetry in English. He won the 2000 [[Nonino#Winners|International Nonino Prize]] in Italy.

His death by [[euthanasia]], which is legal in Belgium, led to considerable controversy.

==Life==
Hugo Claus was born on 5 April 1929 at Sint-Janshospitaal in [[Bruges]], [[Belgium]].<ref name = "Een virtuoze alleskunner">[http://www.trouw.nl/achtergrond/deverdieping/article1798837.ece/Een_virtuoze_alleskunner.html "Een virtuoze alleskunner"] (19 March 2008). ''De Verdieping''. Retrieved 18 June 2010. {{in lang|nl}}</ref> He was the eldest of four sons born to Jozef Claus and Germaine Vanderlinden. Jozef worked as a printer but was also fond of theatre.<ref name = "J. M. Coetzee, Guardian 2007"/>

Hugo was educated at a [[boarding school]] led by [[nun]]s in [[Aalbeke]] and experienced the [[German occupation of Belgium during World War II]]. The experience was formative, and would later be adapted by Claus into his semi-autobiographical ''[[The Sorrow of Belgium]]'' (1983). Many of Claus' teachers were [[Flemish Movement|Flemish nationalists]] who were sympathetic to [[fascism]], and Claus joined the pro-German youth wing of the [[Flemish National Union]]. His father was also briefly detained after the [[Liberation of Belgium|Liberation]] for [[collaboration with the Axis Powers|collaborationism]].<ref name = "J. M. Coetzee, Guardian 2007">[[J. M.

Claus' prominence in literary circles and his debut as a novelist came in 1950, with the publication of his ''De Metsiers'' at age twenty-one. His first published poems had in fact been printed by his father as early as 1947.<ref name = "Ono Bloom, De Verdieping, 2008">Bloom, Ono (20 March 2008).

From February 1953 until the beginning of 1955, Hugo Claus lived in Italy where his girlfriend {{ill|Elly Overzier|nl}} (born in 1928) acted in a few films. They were married on 26 May 1955, and had a son, Thomas, on 7 October 1963. In the early 1970s, he had an affair with actress [[Sylvia Kristel]], who was 23 years younger, with whom he had a son, Arthur, in 1975. They lived in the [[Raamgracht]] 5–7 building in Amsterdam. The relationship ended in 1977, when she left him for actor [[Ian McShane]].<ref name="BBC">{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7308618.stm | work=BBC News | title=Author Claus dies by euthanasia | date=21 March 2008}}</ref>

He was a "contrarian", of "anarchist spirit".{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Journalist Guy Duplat recalls that Claus had organized in [[Knokke]] the election of a "Miss Knokke Festival", which was a typical beauty contest, except for the Claus ruling that the members of the all-male jury would have to be naked.<ref name="Revue"/>

===Literary career===

Hugo Claus was considered to be one of the most important contemporary Belgian authors.<ref>[http://www.rtbf.be/info/societe/ARTICLE_168325 Radio-Television Belge RTBF (French)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080320120924/http://www.rtbf.be/info/societe/ARTICLE_168325 |date=20 March 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ledevoir.com/2008/03/20/181368.html|title=Le Devoir}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.la-croix.com/|title=La Croix – Actualité à la Une en France, en Europe et dans le Monde|website=La Croix}}</ref> Claus published the novel ''Schola Nostra'' (1971) under the pseudonym Dorothea Van Male. He also used the pseudonyms Jan Hyoens and Thea Streiner. The 1962 ''De verwondering'' (''The Astonishment'') and the 1983 ''Het verdriet van België'' (''[[The Sorrow of Belgium]]'') rank among Claus' most significant works as a novelist.<ref name = "Hugo Brems 2001">Brems, Hugo (2007). "Claus, Hugo (1929–)". In Bernard A. Cook (Ed.), ''Europe Since 1945: An Encyclopedia'', Volume 1 (pp. 204–205). London: Taylor & Francis. {{ISBN|0-8153-1336-5}}.</ref> Lee views ''Het verdriet van België'' as a postmodern critique of national identity.<ref>Lee, M. (2002). National Identity and Its Construction: The Codification of Flemish Identity Illustrated through ''Het verdriet van België'' by Hugo Claus. ''Dutch Crossing: A Journal of Low Countries Studies'', 26(2), 212–232.</ref>

Most prolific in literary endeavors as a dramatist, Claus wrote 35 original pieces and 31 translations from English, Greek, Latin, French and Spanish plays and novels. His dramatic sketch ''Masscheroen'' was first staged at [[Knokke Casino]] and featured an all-nude cast: three naked men were given the task of portraying the Christian [[Holy Trinity]] of [[God the father]], [[God the son]], and the [[Holy Spirit]]; the work also made light of the [[Holy Virgin]], a Belgian [[saint]], and the [[Three Wise Men]].<ref name = "Willinger Introduction 2007">Willinger, David (2007). "Introduction". In Hugo Claus, ''The Sacrament and Other Plays of Forbidden Love'' (pp. 11–80). Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania: Susquehanna University Press. {{ISBN|978-1-57591-110-6}}</ref> Attacked as [[blasphemy|blasphemous]] and deleterious to the public's moral well-being, the light-hearted play's performance triggered a notable legal case in which Claus was prosecuted: convicted on charges of public indecency, Claus was ordered to pay a ten-thousand-[[Belgian franc]] fine and serve a four-month prison sentence.<ref name = "Een virtuoze alleskunner"/><ref name = "J. M. Coetzee, Guardian 2007"/><ref name="Willinger Introduction 2007"/> The prison term was reduced to a [[suspended sentence]] after a public outcry.<ref name = "J. M. Coetzee, Guardian 2007"/>

Claus also wrote the script of a [[satire|satirical]] comic strip, "De Avonturen van Belgman" ("The Adventures of Belgian Man") in 1967, which spoofed the Belgian bi-lingual troubles. The strip itself was drawn by artist ''Hugoké'' (Hugo de Kempeneer).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bluesonline.weebly.com/de-avonturen-van-belgman.html|title=De avonturen van Belgman|website=Blues Online}}</ref>

Hugo Claus' name had been put forward many times for the [[Nobel Prize in literature]], on which he would casually comment "this prize money would suit me fine".<ref name="Revue">[http://blogrtbf.typepad.com/matin_premiere/2008/03/2003---revue-de.html Revue de la presse belge (French)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420155214/http://blogrtbf.typepad.com/matin_premiere/2008/03/2003---revue-de.html |date=20 April 2008 }}</ref>

===Painting and film===
As a painter, Claus was a participant in the CoBrA art movement from 1950. He had developed friendships with some of its members, and illustrated a book by [[Pierre Alechinsky]] in 1949.<ref name="jaski">{{cite web |url=http://www.jaski.nl/CoBrAKunstenaars/HugoClaus/tabid/188/Default.aspx |title=Hugo Claus |publisher=Jaski Art Gallery |access-date=12 February 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206125235/http://www.jaski.nl/CoBrAKunstenaars/HugoClaus/tabid/188/Default.aspx |archivedate=6 February 2007}}</ref> He collaborated with key figures in the movement including [[Karel Appel]] and [[Guillaume Cornelis van Beverloo|Corneille]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.researchportal.be/en/project/hugo-claus-s-position-as-poet-painter-in-flemish-dutch-experimentalism-1947-1955--(UA_4543)/ |title=Hugo Claus's position as poet-painter in Flemish/Dutch experimentalism (1947–1955) |publisher=University of Antwerp |access-date=12 February 2009}}</ref> and participated in some exhibitions.<ref name="jaski" /> He later used his experiences of this time in his book ''Een zachte vernieling'' (''Mild Destruction'').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nlpvf.nl/book/book2.php?Book=657 |title=Hugo Claus: Mild Destruction (Een zachte vernieling) |publisher=NLPVF – Foundation for the Production and Translation of Dutch Literature |access-date=12 February 2009}}</ref>

Claus directed seven films between 1964 and 2001. His film ''[[The Sacrament (1989 film)|Het sacrament]]'' was screened in the [[Un Certain Regard]] section at the [[1990 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name="festival-cannes.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/193/year/1990.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The Sacrament |access-date=7 August 2009 |work=festival-cannes.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004074037/http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/193/year/1990.html |archivedate=4 October 2012}}</ref>

===Death===
Claus suffered from [[Alzheimer's]] disease and requested his life to be terminated through [[euthanasia]], a legal procedure in Belgium, at the Middelheim Hospital in [[Antwerp]] on 19 March 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf19032008_071|title=Hugo Claus overleden|last=svh|website=De Standaard}}</ref>

[[Bert Anciaux]], then Flemish Minister of Culture,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vlaanderen.be/nl/vlaamse-regering/regeringen-peeters|title=Regeringen Peeters|date=10 September 2014|work=Vlaanderen.be|access-date=3 March 2018|language=nl-BE}}</ref> stated "I knew him well enough to know that he wanted to depart with pride and dignity."<ref>[http://tf1.lci.fr/infos/culture/livres/0,,3782747,00-hugo-claus-ets-mort-belges-sont-chagrin-.html LCI (French)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321010954/http://tf1.lci.fr/infos/culture/livres/0,,3782747,00-hugo-claus-ets-mort-belges-sont-chagrin-.html |date=21 March 2008 }}</ref> Former Belgian Prime Minister [[Guy Verhofstadt]] said that he imagined the onset of Alzheimer's must have been "inevitable and unbearable torture". "I can live with the fact that he decided thus," he said, "because he left us as a great glowing [[star]], right on time, just before he would have collapsed into a [[Stellar black hole]]."<ref name="BBC"/>

His death by euthanasia has received criticism from the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the Belgian Alzheimer League.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alzheimerliga.be/|title=Welkom – Alzheimer Liga vzw|website=www.alzheimerliga.be}}</ref> The [[Roman Catholic Church]] criticized the media coverage; Belgian Cardinal [[Godfried Danneels]] referred to Claus' euthanasia in his Easter Homily.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.standaard.be/cnt/7q1pp3tn|title=Kardinaal Danneels: 'de dood omzeilen is geen heldendaad'|website=De Standaard}}</ref> The Belgian Alzheimer League respects Claus' decision, but believes the media coverage of his death neglects other options for Alzheimer's patients.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
