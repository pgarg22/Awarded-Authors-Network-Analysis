=== Scripts ===
Ann has written and directed two stage plays for Yorkshire Women’s Theatre, one play for [[BBC Radio 4]] and is currently working with a director on a short film script based on one of her poems. 

Ann also co-wrote the script for the 'Genie' exhibition at the [[Magna Science Adventure Centre]] that was piloted in late 2006.

''"Oh great one, to restore my power, tell me what I am like. I will ask questions so that you can tell my story [. . .] Every idea is a good idea, however simple or odd or rushed, because it is yours."''

Children access the 'genie spirit' inside the exhibits using a  'magic mirror' (a tablet PC). The children interact with the genie, and produce poems that become 'memory stories' for the genie.

== Reviews ==

'''In Praise of Men and Other People'''<br />
"Ann Sansom's new collection is a welcome return for a quietly authoritative, resiliently gritty poet whose debut collection. Romance, won her many admirers. These are poems that overturn readers' expectations. They often present human dramas in which people are seen as acting out their versions of themselves in their own fictions. They are set in curiously deracinated urban landscapes, homing in on chance encounters and missed connections, and balanced by a brisk authenticity and affectionate generosity."<br /> 
''[[Times Literary Supplement]]''

'''Romance'''<br />
"Ann Sansom’s naturally accomplished and instinctively organised poems come as a breath of fresh air … There is a maturity to her work, a sureness of hand associated with only the most established poets, but there is a freshness too, and a bareknuckle confidence that seems to sing of the author’s realisation of poetry as a first language and a mother tongue."<br />
''[[Simon Armitage]]''

'''Opening the Ice'''<br />
"A clear sense of narrative illuminated by accurate observation . . . with a sharp edge of personal involvement, of love and love lost that gives her poems an intimate feel. Warm, direct and delicately phrased."<br />
''David Harmer''
