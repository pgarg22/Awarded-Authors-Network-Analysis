'''Jean Daurat''' ([[Occitan]]: '''Joan Dorat'''; [[Latin]]: '''Auratus''') (3 April 1508{{snd}}1 November 1588) was a [[French people|French]] [[poet]], [[scholar]] and a member of a group known as ''[[La Pléiade|The Pléiade]]''.

==Early life==
He was born '''Joan Dinemandy''' in [[Limoges]] and was a member of a noble family. After studying at the College of Limoges, he came to [[Paris]] to be presented to King [[Francis I of France]], who made him tutor to his pages. He rapidly gained an immense reputation as a [[classical scholar]].<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Daurat, Jean|volume=7|page=851}}</ref>

==Career==
As a private tutor in the house of [[Lazare de Baif]], he had [[Jean-Antoine de Baif]] for his pupil. His son, Louis, showed great precocity and at the age of ten, translated into French verse one of his father's Latin pieces.  His poems were published with his father's.<ref name="EB1911"/>

Daurat became director of the Collège de Coqueret, where he had among his pupils [[Antoine de Baif]], [[Pierre de Ronsard]], [[Remy Belleau]], and [[Pontus de Tyard]]. [[Joachim du Bellay]] was added by Ronsard to this group, and these five young poets, under the direction of Daurat, formed a society for the reformation of the [[French language]] and literature. They increased their number to seven by the initiation of the dramatist [[Étienne Jodelle]], and thereupon they named themselves ''La Pléiade'', in emulation of the seven Greek poets of [[Alexandria]]. The election of Daurat as their leader proved his personal influence, and the value his pupils set on the learning to which he introduced them, but as a writer of French verse he is the least important of the seven. Meanwhile, he collected around him a sort of Academy, and encouraged the students in a passionate study of Greek and Latin poetry. He himself wrote incessantly in both those languages, and was styled "the modern [[Pindar]]". His influence extended beyond the bounds of his own country, and he was famous as a scholar in [[England]], [[Italy]], and [[Germany]].<ref name="EB1911"/>

In 1556 he was appointed professor of Greek at the [[Collège de France|Collège Royal]].  In 1567, he resigned the post in favour of his nephew, Nicolas Goulu. King [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]] gave him the title of ''poeta regius'' ("the king's poet"). His prolific output was the wonder of his time; he is said to have composed more than 15,000 Greek and Latin verses. The best of these he published at Paris in 1586. He died at Paris, having survived all his illustrious pupils of the ''Pléiade'', except Pontus de Tyard. The ''Œuvres poétiques'' in the vernacular of Jean Daurat were edited in 1875 with biographical notice and bibliography by [[Charles Marty-Laveaux]] in his ''Pléiade française''.<ref name="EB1911"/>

Daurat has been credited with the development of the [[claque]] in the French theatre, in which professional applauders are paid to ensure the success of (or in other cases, booed to ensure the failure of) certain plays, playwrights, and actors.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Scholarship==

Daurat is described by [[Eduard Fraenkel]] as "the true initiator of the study of Greek poetry in France". His pupils, including [[Joseph Justus Scaliger]], were responsible for circulating the numerous textual conjectures made by Daurat, especially in Aeschylus' ''Agamemnon'', which Daurat himself left unpublished.<ref>E. Fraenkel, ''Aeschylus: Agamemnon'', volume 1, pp. 34–35.</ref>
