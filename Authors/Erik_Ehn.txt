It premiered at the Roy and Edna Disney/CalArts Theater ([[REDCAT]]) in April 2005.

His play ''Maria Kizito'' is based on the 1994 [[genocide in Rwanda]] and is the result of his research in that Central [[Africa]]n country. Its premiere launched [[Atlanta]]'s 7 Stages 2004â€“05 season. Ehn's work includes ''The Saint Plays'', an ongoing cycle of plays loosely based on the lives of the [[saint]]s and biblical characters. Other plays include ''Book of Tink'', ''Heavenly Shades of Night are Falling,'' ''No Time Like the Present'', ''Wolf at the Door'', ''Tailings'', ''Beginner'', ''Ideas of Good and Evil'', ''13 Christs'' and an [[literary adaptation|adaptation]] of [[William Faulkner]]'s ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]''.

His dramas have been produced in [[San Francisco]], [[Seattle]], [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[New York City]], [[San Diego]], [[Baltimore]], and [[Chicago]]. In 2004, he served as [[dramaturge]] on ''Peach Blossom Fan'' - the inaugural production by CalArts Center for New Theater at REDCAT.

Ehn's ''Soulographie: Our Genocides'', a series of 17 plays, was presented as a two-day marathon at [[La MaMa]] in 2012. Together the plays examine the relationship of 20th century America to [[genocide in the United States]], Central America, and East Africa. About half of the plays in the cycle incorporated puppetry.<ref>{{cite web|last=Coelho|first=Courtney|title=Ehn Takes Soulographie: Our Genocides to New York City|url=http://news.brown.edu/pressreleases/2012/09/soulographie|accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref> Although most of the plays in the cycle had previously been performed individually, the production presented them together for the first time.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gates|first=Anita|title=Plenty of Voices, Heard as One, Telling Stories Without Wavering|url=http://theater.nytimes.com/2012/11/15/theater/reviews/soulographie-our-genocides-at-la-mama.html|publisher=NY Times|accessdate=10 March 2013|date=14 November 2012}}</ref>
