'''Adam Stanisław Naruszewicz''' ({{lang-lt|Adomas Naruševičius}}; 20 October 1733 – 8 July 1796) was a [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish-Lithuanian]] nobleman, poet, historian, dramatist, translator, publicist, [[Jesuit]] and Roman Catholic bishop.

Born in an impoverished aristocratic family, he went on to become a close advisor to the Polish king [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]], a titular [[Bishop of Smolensk]] (1775–1788 as [[coadjutor bishop]]  and 1788–1790 as full [[diocesan bishop]]) and [[bishop of Łuck]] (1790–1796), and a member of the government of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] through his seat in the [[Permanent Council]] (1781–1786). 

He has been described as one of the most significant writers of the [[Enlightenment in Poland|Polish Enlightenment]], as well as one of the first modern Polish historians, responsible for popularizing the term "[[Piast dynasty]]" for describing the first dynasty of Poland.

Naruszewicz was a prolific writer (in both Polish and Latin), beginning his literary career in the late 1740s, with his first work debuting publicly in 1756.<ref name="NaruszewiczWolska2005" />{{Rp|7-8}} He wrote odes, idylls, satires, fairy tales, epigrams, and rococo poems; many of those were praising King Poniatowski, although those [[panegyric]] works are rarely considered his best.<ref name="NaruszewiczWolska2005" />{{Rp|6, 12}} He also was active as a publisher and as a translator of Latin and French works into Polish—he translated works of authors such as [[Anacreon]], [[Horace]], [[Tacitus]], as well as modern Latin-writing authors such as Pole [[Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski]] and Swiss [[Salomon Gessner]].<ref name="NaruszewiczWolska2005" />{{Rp|6}} 

In his later life, he moved away from writing fiction, focusing on historical research, culminating in the seven volumes of ''{{ill|Historia narodu polskiego|pl|Historia narodu polskiego}}'' (''History of the Polish Nation''), mostly written in the years 1776–1779 and published in the subsequent decade. He also compiled documents, known as ''{{ill|Teki Naruszewicza|pl|Teki Naruszewicza}}'' (''Naruszewicz's Folders''), unpublished during his life, that later became a valuable archive to future historians.<ref name="NaruszewiczWolska2005" />{{Rp|7}} <ref name=":0" />{{Rp|559}} His other works in the realm of history including a monography on [[Hetmans of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|hetman]] [[Jan Karol Chodkiewicz]] (published in 1781) and over 130 shorter biographies of other notable individuals.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|557}} Finally, his works also included political pamphlets in support of Poniatowski's faction.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|557}}

== Significance ==
He has been described as "one of the most significant poets of the Polish Enlightenment",<ref name="NaruszewiczWolska2005">{{cite book|author1=Adam Naruszewicz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i-bGwgEACAAJ|title=Poezje zebrane|author2=Barbara Wolska|publisher=Instytut Badań Literackich|year=2005|isbn=978-83-89348-56-2|language=Polish}}</ref>{{Rp|7}} and the most significant poet associated with the Poniatowski's political faction.<ref name="NaruszewiczWolska2005" />{{Rp|6}} He has been described as the leading Polish literary figure of the early Enlightenment, before that position was taken over by [[Ignacy Krasicki]].<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|560}} His literary work has been described as fitting in the spirit of [[Age of Enlightenment|The Enlightenment]], although formally—through their form and language—still displaying many similarities to the styles of the previous era (baroque, classicism, sentimentalism and roccoco). Naruszewicz has been credited with initiating a number of changes in the style of Polish literature, and being one of the Polish originators of the novelty of the Enlightenment ideas expressed in poetry. His works have inspired a number of following writers.<ref name="NaruszewiczWolska2005" />{{Rp|8}}<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|556}}
