'''Renée Gertrude Taylor''' {{postnominals|country=NZL|ONZM|size=85%}} (born 1929), known mononymously as '''Renée''',<ref name="The Dominion">{{cite news|last1=Pollard|first1=Suzanne|title=Renee digs deeper than history books|work=The Dominion|date=17 April 1986}}</ref> is a New Zealand feminist writer and playwright. Renée is of [[Māori people|Māori]] ([[Ngāti Kahungunu]]), Irish, English, and Scottish ancestry, and has described herself as a "lesbian feminist with socialist working-class ideals".<ref name=nzbc>{{cite web |url=http://www.bookcouncil.org.nz/writers/renee.html |title=Renee |publisher=New Zealand Book Council |access-date=9 November 2009}}</ref> She wrote her first play, ''Setting the Table'', in 1981. Many of her plays have been published, with extracts included in ''Intimate Acts'', a collection of lesbian plays published by Brito and Lair, New York.<ref>{{cite book|title=Intimate Acts: Eight Contemporary Lesbian Plays|date=1997|publisher=Brito & Lair|isbn=0964623013}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Renée was born in [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]], New Zealand. She attended Greenmeadows School in [[Hawke's Bay]].

<blockquote>I liked school. I got a lot of approval there. Except when it came to sport. I was uninterested. I preferred to read...My interest in theatre started at school. They used to have a concert every year. The first half would be items by individuals or groups and the second half would be a play. I was in two or three plays and I loved it. I loved being someone else even if it was only for a short time.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Dominion|date=9 July 1985}}</ref></blockquote>

Renée left school at the age of 12 to work in the local woollen mills and then a printing factory.<ref>{{cite book|title=Song of the Shirt|date=1993|publisher=McIndoe Publishers|location=Dunedin, New Zealand|isbn=0868681342|url=http://nlnzcat.natlib.govt.nz/vwebv/holdingsInfo?searchId=10230&recCount=25&recPointer=1&bibId=58649}}</ref>

In 1979, Renée completed a Bachelor of Arts at [[University of Auckland|Auckland University]]. Completed over ten years, much of her B.A. was gained through extramural study from [[Massey University]].

==Career==
Renée is a pioneering figure for women in the New Zealand theatre landscape. Fellow New Zealand playwright, [[Lorae Parry]], has said:

<blockquote>Renée opened the stage door and strode in, announcing her arrival and standing centre stage. She opened the door with a bang, not with a whimper and many of us followed. It was time. Someone needed to do it. Renée had the guts.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parry|first1=Lorae|title=Meat and Potatoes|journal=Playmarket News|date=Autumn 2005|issue=35|page=6}}</ref></blockquote>

Renée began writing short stories, reviews and humorous columns for newspapers when her three children were young. She also began acting in the Napier Repertory Theatre. For twenty years she directed plays for a number of theatrical groups and schools in the Hawke's Bay area.

Renee's attendance at the United Women's Convention in Wellington in 1975 was an important experience. The convention enabled her to recognise that "...a lot of the things I thought and felt resentful about were things other women thought and felt too."<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=Sandi|date=April 1982|title=Writing The Wrongs|journal=Broadsheet|page=33}}</ref> A feminist perspective became an important part of her theatre work and writing from that point onwards.

In 1979, Renée relocated to Auckland to complete her B.A. at the [[University of Auckland]]. During this time, she worked as a cleaner at Auckland's Theatre Corporate. Six years later, she returned to Theatre Corporate as Playwright in Residence. Following her graduation, Renée worked at a secondary school teaching English and Drama. Renée began writing her first play ''Setting The Table'' on New Year's Day in 1981, the first draft of which was completed in five days. In a 1982 interview with New Zealand feminist magazine ''[[Broadsheet (magazine)|Broadsheet]]'', Renée said she “wanted to write a play that showed women as intelligent, {{sic|humo|urous|nolink=y}} and strong. I wanted to write a play with very good parts for women — that also put forward some political themes.”<ref>{{cite web|url=https://broadsheet.auckland.ac.nz/document/1982_(Nos._96-105)/No._98_(April_1982)?action=null|title=Document viewer - Broadsheet|website=broadsheet.auckland.ac.nz|access-date=2018-06-22}}</ref>

Renée went on to many write plays which feature women in leading roles and humanise working-class people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playmarket.org.nz/playwrights/ren%C3%A9e|title=Renée|website=Playmarket|access-date=25 June 2018}}</ref>

Renée was invited to attend the First International Women Playwrights Conference in New York in October 1988.<ref>{{cite news|title=Renee invited to US meeting|work=The Evening Post|date=30 October 1987}}</ref> She was one of three keynote speakers. She also attended the Pacific Writers Conference in London and took part of in a reading tour of Britain and Europe.

Renée has been described as "one of the 'first wave' of waahine playwrights"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Te-Puea Hansen|first1=Mei-Lin|title=Aroha's Granddaughters: Representations of Maaori Women in Maaori Drama and Theatre 1980 – 2000|journal=Thesis|year=2005|url=https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/handle/2292/1420}}</ref> whose representation of female characters showed the complexity of Māori women's lives and more accurately represented their varied life experiences.

Of her background, Renée has said:

<blockquote>My upbringing and conditioning is largely European, but I have an instinctive love of Māori ritual. Even though I don't understand the language, I feel at home. But I also feel that because of my upbringing, I'll always be an outsider in both worlds. It's got a lot to do with class, too – my roots are rural. Sometimes I feel alienated from the European world, and sometimes from the Māori world; because I sometimes feel inadequate in both of them.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hall|first1=Sandi|work=New Zealand Times|date=22 December 1995}}</ref></blockquote>

Renée chose to use only her first name as her professional name "simply because it was the name her mother gave her, and the only one she really felt was hers." Of this decision she has said, "I didn't realise I was making a political statement but that's how it is seen, I think."<ref name="The Dominion"/>

Some of Renée's best known plays form a trilogy, beginning with ''[[Wednesday to Come]]'' (1984) which shows the effect on a family of the 1930s [[Great Depression]] in New Zealand. The characters in ''Wednesday to Come'' include three generations of women in one family. ''[[Pass It On (play)|Pass It On]]'' (1986) follows the two children in ''Wednesday to Come'' now that they have grown up and married. It celebrates the role of working-class women in the [[1951 New Zealand waterfront dispute]]. ''Jeannie Once'' (1991), is a prequel to ''Wednesday to Come'' in that it focusses on the past of ''Wednesday to Come'''s Granna and her life as a seamstress in Victorian [[Dunedin]]. One of the characters in ''Jeannie Once'' is a Māori servant, Martha, who ends up being committed to an asylum. ''Jeannie Once'' features elements of [[Music Hall]].

In October 2017, Renée published a memoir entitled ''These Two Hands'', published by [[Mākaro Press]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://makaropress.co.nz/makaro-books-2/these-two-hands-a-memoir-by-renee/|title=These Two Hands: a memoir by Renée {{!}} Mākaro Press|website=makaropress.co.nz|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-22}}</ref>
