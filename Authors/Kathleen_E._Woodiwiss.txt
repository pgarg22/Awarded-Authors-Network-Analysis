'''Kathleen E. Woodiwiss''' (born '''Kathleen Erin Hogg''', June 3, 1939 – July 6, 2007), was an American novelist. She pioneered the [[historical romance]] genre with the 1972 publication of her novel ''[[The Flame and the Flower]]''.

==Early life ==
She was born Kathleen Erin Hogg in [[Alexandria, Louisiana]], the youngest of eight children of Charles Wingrove Hogg, a disabled [[World War I]] veteran, and his wife, Gladys, née Coker.<ref name="strike"/> As a child, she relished creating her own stories, and by age six, was telling herself stories at night to help fall asleep.<ref name="breu"/><ref name="weiss">{{cite web|last=Weiss |first=Angela |title=Interview with Kathleen E. Woodiwiss |publisher=Bertelsmann Club |date=October 2000 |url=http://www.die-buecherecke.de/woodiwis.HTM |accessdate=2007-05-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070406011725/http://www.die-buecherecke.de/woodiwis.HTM |archivedate=2007-04-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Her father died suddenly when Woodiwiss was only 12, leaving her to be raised by her mother and older sisters. Woodiwiss would later remark that, "every single one of us had minds of our own even then; I was no exception. I suppose that carried over into my creations of heroines who weren't weak-willed."<ref name="weiss"/>

==Career==
At age 16, she met [[U.S. Air Force]] [[Second Lieutenant]] Ross Eugene Woodiwiss at a dance.<ref name="breu"/> They married the following year, on July 20, 1956.<ref name="strike"/> She attended school locally and graduated in 1957. Her husband's military career led them to live in Japan, where she worked part-time as a fashion model for an American-owned modeling agency.  After over three years in Japan, the family moved to [[Topeka, Kansas]] and then settled in Minnesota.<ref name="strike"/> During these years, she attempted to write a novel several times, but each time stopped in frustration at the slow pace of writing in longhand. After buying her husband an electric [[typewriter]] as a Christmas present, she appropriated the machine to begin her novel in earnest.<ref name="weiss"/>

Her debut novel, ''[[The Flame and the Flower]]'', was rejected by agents and hardcover publishers as being too long at 600 pages. Rather than follow the advice of the rejection letters and rewrite the novel, Woodiwiss instead submitted it to paperback publishers. The first publisher on her list, Avon, quickly purchased the novel. Editor Nancy Coffey provided a $1500 advance and arranged for an initial 500,000 print run.<ref name="breu"/> ''The Flame and the Flower'' was revolutionary, featuring an epic historical romance with a strong heroine and actual sex scenes. This novel, published in 1972, sold over 2.3 million copies in its first four years of publication and is credited with spawning the modern [[romance novel|romance]] genre, becoming the first romance novel "to [follow] the principals into the bedroom."<ref name="athitakis">{{citation | last = Athitakis | first = Mark | title = A Romance Glossary | newspaper = SF Weekly | date = July 25, 2001 | url =http://www.sfweekly.com/2001-07-25/news/a-romance-glossary/ | accessdate = 2007-04-23}}</ref><ref name="zaitchik">{{citation|last=Zaitchik |first=Alexander |title=The Romance Writers of America convention is just super |newspaper=New York Press |date=July 22, 2003 |url=http://www.nypress.com/16/30/news&columns/feature.cfm |accessdate=2007-04-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823214946/http://www.nypress.com/16/30/news%26columns/feature.cfm |archivedate=August 23, 2007 }}</ref><ref name="time">{{citation | last =Darrach | first = Brad | title = Rosemary's Babies | newspaper = Time Magazine | date = January 17, 1977 | url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,918604,00.html | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070930101445/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,918604,00.html | url-status =dead | archive-date =September 30, 2007 | accessdate = 2007-05-28 }}</ref> The success of this novel prompted a new style of writing [[romance novel|romance]], concentrating primarily on historical fiction tracking the [[monogamous]] relationships between helpless heroines and the heroes who rescued them, even if they had been the ones to place them in danger.<ref name="whitepamela">{{citation|last=White |first=Pamela |title=Romancing Society |newspaper=Boulder Weekly |date=August 15, 2002 |url=http://www.boulderweekly.com/archive/081502/coverstory.html |accessdate=2007-04-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904133155/http://www.boulderweekly.com/archive/081502/coverstory.html |archivedate=September 4, 2007 }}</ref>  The romance novels which followed in her example featured longer plots, more controversial situations and characters, and more intimate and steamy sex scenes.<ref name="dukes">{{cite web | last = Dukes | first = Jessica | title = Kathleen E.

Woodiwiss had a direct impact on the career of fellow novelist [[LaVyrle Spencer]]. Soon after finding her own success, Woodiwiss read a manuscript written by Spencer, who had yet to earn a publishing contract. Woodiwiss promptly mailed Spencer's novel to her own editor at [[Avon Books|Avon]]. The editor purchased the novel, ''The Fulfillment'', beginning Spencer's career.<ref name="thurston">{{cite book|last=Thurston|first=Carol|title=The Romance Revolution|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana and Chicago|year=1987|isbn=0-252-01442-1|pages=178–179}}</ref> In addition, many modern romance novelists cite Woodiwiss as their inspiration. [[Julia Quinn]] remarked that "Woodiwiss made women want to read. She gave them an alternative to Westerns and hard-boiled police procedurals. When I was growing up, I saw my mother and grandmother reading and enjoying romances, and when I was old enough to read them myself, I felt as if I had been admitted into a special sisterhood of reading women."<ref name="dukes"/><ref name="avon1997">{{cite web | title = Love Notes | publisher = Avon Books | date = November 1997 | url =http://www.kathleenewoodiwiss.com/time/items/petals_river01.asp | accessdate = 2007-05-28 }}</ref>

Woodiwiss published twelve [[best-seller|best-selling]] romance novels, with over thirty-six million copies in print.<ref name="strike"/> Woodiwiss was known for the quality of her novels rather than the quantity of works she published. She often took four to five years to write a single novel. In some cases, Woodiwiss attributed the lag in publication time to personal and health issues, while in others she confessed to having suffered [[Occupational burnout|burnout]] and needing a rest to recover her interest in writing.<ref name="weiss"/>

All of her novels were historical romances set in varied backgrounds, including the American Civil War, 18th-century England, or Saxony in the time of [[William the Conqueror]].<ref name="breu"/>  The heroines of the novels are strong-willed young women with "a spark of life and determination."<ref name="weiss"/>  Woodiwiss describes her novels as "fairy tales.  They are an escape for the reader, like an [[Errol Flynn]] movie."<ref name="breu">{{citation | last =Breu | first = Giovanna | title = Romance Writer Kathleen Woodiwiss was Passionate about Horses - And Happy Endings | newspaper = [[People Magazine]]  | date = February 7, 1983 | url =http://www.kathleenewoodiwiss.com/time/items/rose_winter07.asp  | accessdate = 2007-05-28 }}</ref>

==Later life==
Woodiwiss was an avid equestrienne who at one time lived in a large house on {{convert|55|acre|m2}} in [[Minnesota]]. After her husband's death in 1996, she moved back to [[Louisiana]]. She died in a hospital in [[Princeton, Minnesota]], aged 68, from [[cancer]].<ref name="death">{{cite web | title = Kathleen E.

She was survived by two sons, Sean and Heath, their wives, and numerous grandchildren. A third son, Dorren, predeceased her.<ref name="strike">{{cite web|title=Kathleen E.

==Reception==
[[Laura Kinsale]] in her essay "The Androgynous Reader" in ''Dangerous Men and Adventurous Women'' cites the heroine of ''Shanna'' as proof that the average romance reader is not identifying with the heroine, but rather as a placeholder for themselves to be with the hero, for a "sillier and more wrongheaded heroine than Shanna would be difficult to imagine...Feminists need not tremble for the reader--she does not identify with, admire, or internalize the characteristics of either a stupidly submissive or an irksomely independent heroine. The reader thinks about what she would have done in the heroine's place.<ref>{{cite book | title=Dangerous Men and Adventurous Women: Romance Writers on the Appeal of the Romance
