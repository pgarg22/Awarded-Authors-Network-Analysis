Kurz's collections of poems, ''Gedichte'' (1836) and ''Dichtungen'' (1839), were less successful than his historical novels, ''[[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]]'s Heimatjahre'' (1843) and ''Der Sonnenwirt'' (1854), and his excellent translations from English, Italian and Spanish. He also published a successful modern German version of [[Gottfried von Strassburg]]'s ''[[Tristan and Iseult]]'' (1844). His collected works were published in ten volumes (Stuttgart, 1874).

His daughter, [[Isolde Kurz]], was also a poet.
