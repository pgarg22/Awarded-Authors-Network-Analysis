=== Controversy about ''Some Kids I Taught and What They Taught Me'' ===
<!-- Some of this would be better placed in an article for the book itself, if such an article is created -->
In August 2021, Clanchy announced that she would rewrite her book ''Some Kids I Taught and What They Taught Me'' after passages from it were criticised online for their depictions of ethnic minority, autistic and working class children, including use of terms described by some as "dehumanising", "racist", "anti-Black", and "[[antisemitism|antisemitic]]".<ref name="Rajesh Guardian">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/aug/13/pointing-out-racism-in-books-is-not-an-attack-kate-clanchy |title=Pointing out racism in books is not an ‘attack’ – it’s a call for industry reform |last=Rajesh |first=Monisha |author-link=Monisha Rajesh |date=13 August 2021 |work=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=14 August 2021}}</ref> Detractors included fellow writers [[Dara McAnulty]], [[Monisha Rajesh]], [[Sunny Singh (writer)|Sunny Singh]] and [[Chimene Suleyman]]. Clanchy was defended by Philip Pullman and Amanda Craig.

Clanchy had initially claimed, incorrectly, that the extracts concerned were "all made up", then argued that the quotes, which she herself described as "racist",<ref name="Rajesh Guardian"/><ref>{{Cite tweet |last=Clanchy |first=Kate |user=KateClanchy1 |number=142113282515628032 |date=30 July 2021 |title=Sorry to whinge but - on @goodreads , someone made up a racist quote and said it was in my book. Other reviewers picked it up and repeated it.  I've flagged the reviews many times but it does no good. Today I got my first email threat based on it. Is there anything I can do? |access-date=30 August 2021 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210730154958/https://twitter.com/KateClanchy1/status/142113282515628032  |archive-date=30 July 2021 }}</ref> had been taken out of context.<ref name="Campbell Guardian"/> Clanchy Later issued a statement apologising for "overreacting" to the critiques and stating that she "got many things wrong, and welcome[d] the chance to write better, more lovingly".<ref name="Campbell Guardian"/><ref name="Rajesh Guardian"/>
