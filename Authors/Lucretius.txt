'''Titus Lucretius Carus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|aɪ|t|ə|s|_|l|uː|ˈ|k|r|iː|ʃ|ə|s}} {{respell|TY|təs|_|loo|KREE|shəs}}, {{IPA-la|ˈtɪtʊs lʊˈkreːtɪ.ʊs ˈkaːrʊs|lang}}; {{circa}} 99&nbsp;– c. 55 BC) was a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Roman literature|poet]] and [[Ancient Roman philosophy|philosopher]]. His only known work is the philosophical poem ''[[De rerum natura]]'', a [[didactic]] work about the tenets and philosophy of [[Epicureanism]], and which usually is translated into English as ''On the Nature of Things''. Lucretius has been credited with originating the concept of the [[three-age system]] that was formalised in 1836 by [[Christian Jürgensen Thomsen|C. J. Thomsen]].

Very little is known about Lucretius's life; the only certainty is that he was either a friend or [[Patronage in ancient Rome|client]] of [[Gaius Memmius (poet)|Gaius Memmius]], to whom the poem was addressed and dedicated.{{sfnp | Melville | Fowler | 2008 | p=xii }}

''De rerum natura'' was a considerable influence on the [[Augustan poetry|Augustan poets]], particularly [[Virgil]] (in his ''[[Aeneid]]'' and ''[[Georgics]]'', and to a lesser extent on the ''[[Eclogues]]'') and [[Horace]].<ref>Reckford, K. J. ''Some studies in Horace's odes on love''</ref> The work was almost lost during the [[Middle Ages]], but was rediscovered in 1417 in a monastery in Germany{{sfnp|Greenblatt|2009|p=44 }} by [[Poggio Bracciolini]] and it played an important role both in the development of [[atomism]] (Lucretius was an important influence on [[Pierre Gassendi]])<ref>

Lucretius's scientific poem ''On the Nature of Things'' {{nowrap|(c. 60 BC)}} has a remarkable description of [[Brownian motion]] of dust particles in verses 113–140 from Book II. He uses this as a proof of the existence of atoms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0131%3Abook%3D2%3Acard%3D80|title=Lucretius, De Rerum Natura (Lucr. 2.80)|accessdate=2021-11-18|date=1916|editor=William Ellery Leonard}}</ref>

Virtually nothing is known about the life of Lucretius, and there is insufficient basis for a confident assertion of the dates of Lucretius's birth or death in other sources. Another, yet briefer, note is found in the ''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]'' of Donatus's pupil, [[Jerome]]. Writing four centuries after Lucretius's death, he enters under the 171st [[Olympiad]]: "Titus Lucretius the poet is born."<ref name=chronicon>[[Jerome]], ''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]''.</ref> If Jerome is accurate about Lucretius's age (43) when Lucretius died (discussed below), then it may be concluded he was born in 99 or 98 BC.{{sfnp | Bailey | 1947 | pp=1–3}}{{sfnp | Smith | 1992 | pp=x–xi }} Less specific estimates place the birth of Lucretius in the 90s BC and his death in the 50s BC,{{sfnp | Kenney | 1971 | p=6 }}{{sfnp | Costa | 1984 | p=ix }} in agreement with the poem's many allusions to the tumultuous state of political affairs in [[Rome]] and its [[Roman civil wars|civil strife]].

Lucretius probably was a member of the aristocratic ''[[Lucretia gens|gens Lucretia]]'', and his work shows an intimate knowledge of the luxurious lifestyle in Rome.{{sfnp | Melville | Fowler | 2008 | loc=Foreword }} Lucretius's love of the countryside invites speculation that he inhabited family-owned rural estates, as did many wealthy Roman families, and he certainly was expensively educated with a mastery of Latin, Greek, literature, and philosophy.{{sfnp | Melville | Fowler | 2008 | loc=Foreword }}

A brief biographical note is found in [[Aelius Donatus]]'s ''Life of Virgil'', which seems to be derived from an earlier work by [[Suetonius]].{{sfnp | Horsfall | 2000 | p=3 }} The note reads: "The first years of his life Virgil spent in Cremona until the assumption of his ''[[toga virilis]]'' on his 17th birthday (when the same two men held the [[Roman consul|consulate]] as when he was born), and it so happened that on the very same day Lucretius the poet passed away." However, although Lucretius certainly lived and died around the time that Virgil and Cicero [[fl.|flourished]], the information in this particular testimony is internally inconsistent: if Virgil was born in 70 BC, his 17th birthday would be in 53. The two consuls of 70 BC, [[Pompey]] and [[Marcus Licinius Crassus|Crassus]], stood together as consuls again in 55, not 53. Another yet briefer note is found in the ''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]'' of Donatus's pupil, [[Jerome]]. Writing four centuries after Lucretius's death, Jerome contends in the aforementioned ''Chronicon'' that Lucretius "was driven mad by a love [[potion]], and when, during the intervals of his insanity, he had written a number of books, which were later emended by Cicero, he killed himself by his own hand in the 44th year of his life."<ref name=chronicon/> The claim that he was driven mad by a love potion, although defended by such scholars as Reale and Catan,{{sfnp | Reale | Catan | 1980 | p=414 }} is often dismissed as the result of historical confusion,{{sfnp | Melville | Fowler | 2008 | p=xii }} or anti-Epicurean bias.{{sfnp | Smith | 2011 | p=vii }} In some accounts the administration of the toxic aphrodisiac is attributed to his wife [[Lucilia (wife of Lucretius)|Lucilia]]. Regardless, Jerome's image of Lucretius as a lovesick, mad poet continued to have significant influence on modern scholarship until quite recently, although it now is accepted that such a report is inaccurate.{{sfnp | Gale | 2007 | p=2 }}

His poem ''De rerum natura'' (usually translated as "On the Nature of Things" or "On the Nature of the Universe") transmits the ideas of [[Epicureanism]], which includes [[atomism]] and [[cosmology]]. Lucretius was the first writer known to introduce Roman readers to Epicurean philosophy.{{sfnp | Gale | 2007 | p=35 }} The poem, written in some 7,400 [[dactylic hexameter]]s, is divided into six untitled books, and explores Epicurean physics through richly poetic language and metaphors. Lucretius presents the principles of atomism, the nature of the mind and soul, explanations of sensation and thought, the development of the world and its phenomena, and explains a variety of celestial and terrestrial phenomena. The universe described in the poem operates according to these physical principles, guided by ''fortuna'', "chance", and not the divine intervention of the [[Religion in ancient Rome|traditional Roman deities]]<ref>In particular, ''De rerum natura'' 5.107 (''fortuna gubernans'', "guiding chance" or "fortune at the helm"): see Monica R. Gale, ''Myth and Poetry in Lucretius'' (Cambridge University Press, 1994, 1996 reprint), pp. 213, 223–224 [https://books.google.com/books?id=gf8k02Iud74C&dq=fortuna+lucretius+epicurean+OR+epicureanism+OR+epicurus&q=%22there+is+no+divine+providence%22#v=snippet&q=%22there%20is%20no%20divine%20providence%22&f=false online] and ''Lucretius'' (Oxford University Press, 2007), p. 238 [https://books.google.com/books?id=mHadLr3QVUMC&pg=PA238&dq=%22the+necessity+of+its+process+through+its+physics%22&hl=en&ei=QcpWTPH1FtGknQfk7-GPBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q&f=false online.]</ref> and the religious explanations of the natural world.

Within this work, Lucretius makes reference to the cultural and technological development of humans in his use of available materials, tools, and weapons through prehistory to Lucretius's own time. He specifies the earliest weapons as hands, nails, and teeth. These were followed by stones, branches, and, once humans could kindle and control it, fire. He then refers to "tough iron" and copper in that order, but goes on to say that copper was the primary means of tilling the soil and the basis of weaponry until, "by slow degrees", the iron sword became predominant (it still was in his day) and "the bronze sickle fell into disrepute" as iron ploughs were introduced.<ref name=DRNV1200>{{cite book |last=Lucretius |author-link=Lucretius |title=De rerum natura, Book V, around Line 1200 ff. }}</ref> He had earlier envisaged a pre-technological, pre-literary kind of human whose life was lived "in the fashion of wild beasts roaming at large".<ref name=DRNV940>{{cite book |last=Lucretius |author-link=Lucretius |title=De rerum natura, Book V, around line 940 ff. }}</ref> From this beginning, he theorised, there followed the development in turn of crude huts, use and kindling of fire, clothing, language, family, and city-states. He believed that smelting of metal, and perhaps too, the firing of pottery, was discovered by accident: for example, the result of a forest fire. He does specify, however, that the use of copper followed the use of stones and branches and preceded the use of iron.<ref name=DRNV940/>
 
Lucretius seems to equate copper with [[bronze]], an alloy of copper and tin that has much greater resilience than copper; both copper and bronze were superseded by iron during his millennium (1000 BC to 1 BC). He may have considered bronze to be a stronger variety of copper and not necessarily a wholly individual material. Lucretius is believed to be the first to put forward a theory of the successive uses of first wood and stone, then copper and bronze, and finally iron. Although his theory lay dormant for many centuries, it was revived in the nineteenth century and he has been credited with originating the concept of the [[three-age system]] that was formalised from 1834 by [[Christian Jürgensen Thomsen|C. J. Thomsen]].<ref>Barnes, pp. 27–28.</ref>

===Reception===
In a letter by [[Cicero]] to his brother [[Quintus Tullius Cicero|Quintus]] in February 54 BC, Cicero said: "The poems of Lucretius are as you write: they exhibit many flashes of genius, and yet show great mastership."{{sfnp | Cicero | loc=2.9 }} In the work of another author in late Republican Rome, [[Virgil]] writes in the second book of his ''Georgics'', apparently referring to Lucretius,{{sfnp | Smith | 1975 | loc = intro }}  "Happy is he who has discovered the causes of things and has cast beneath his feet{{efn|name=subiecit pedibus}} all fears, unavoidable fate, and the din of the devouring Underworld."{{sfnp | Virgil | loc=2.490 }}

==Natural philosophy==

An early thinker in what grew to become the study of [[evolution]], Lucretius believed nature experiments endlessly across the aeons, and the organisms that adapt best to their environment have the best chance of surviving. Living organisms survived because of the commensurate relationship between their strength, speed, or intellect and the external dynamics of their environment. Prior to [[Charles Darwin]]'s 1859 publication of [[On the Origin of Species|''The Origin of the Species'']], the natural philosophy of Lucretius typified one of the foremost non-[[Teleology|teleological]] and mechanistic accounts of the creation and evolution of life.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Campbell|first=Gordon|title=Lucretius on Creation and Evolution: A Commentary on De rerum natura 5.772-1104|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=0199263965|location=Oxford/New York|pages=3-6}}</ref> In contrast to modern thought on the subject, he did not believe that new species evolved from previously existing ones and denied that modern animals, which dwell on land, derived from marine ancestors. Lucretius challenged the assumption that humans are necessarily superior to animals, noting that mammalian mothers in the wild recognize and nurture their offspring as do human mothers.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

Despite his advocacy of [[empiricism]] and his many correct conjectures about atomism and the nature of the physical world, Lucretius concludes his first book stressing the absurdity of the (by then well-established) [[spherical Earth]] theory.<ref name="Hannam-Aeon">{{cite web |last=Hannam |first=James |title=Atoms and flat-earth ethics |url=https://aeon.co/essays/lucretius-the-flat-earth-and-the-malaise-of-modern-science |website=Aeon |access-date=8 May 2019 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20190429101743/https://aeon.co/essays/lucretius-the-flat-earth-and-the-malaise-of-modern-science |archive-date=29 April 2019 |date=29 April 2019}}</ref>

While [[Epicurus]] left open the possibility for [[free will]] by arguing for the [[Brownian motion|uncertainty of the paths of atoms]], Lucretius viewed the soul or mind as emerging from arrangements of distinct particles.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gillispie |first=Charles Coulston |author-link=Charles Coulston Gillispie |title=The Edge of Objectivity: An Essay in the History of Scientific Ideas |year=1960 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-02350-6 |page=[https://archive.org/details/edgeofobjectivit00char/page/98 98] |url=https://archive.org/details/edgeofobjectivit00char/page/98 }}</ref>
