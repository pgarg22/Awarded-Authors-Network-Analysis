==Early life and education==
Born in [[Madrid]] on 22 October 1898, Alonso studied [[Law]], [[Philosophy]] and [[Literature]] before undertaking research at Madrid's Centro de Estudios Históricos. An enthusiastic participant in the cultural and literary life at the famous [[Residencia de estudiantes]] (which at this time counted among its residents [[Federico García Lorca]], [[Luis Buñuel]] and [[Salvador Dalí]], amongst others), Alonso also wrote for the literary magazines ''Revista de Occidente'' ('Western Review') and ''Los Cuatro Vientos'' ('The Four Winds').

==Academic career==
Alonso was to become an academic of great renown: he taught Spanish language and literature at several foreign universities, including the [[University of Oxford]] and took up a chair at the [[University of Valencia]] between 1933 and 1939 before moving to the [[Complutense University of Madrid|University of Madrid]]. He was elected to the [[Real Academia Española]] in 1945 and served as its director between 1968 and 1982, when he was named director emeritus.

==Literary career==
Alonso's literary career can essentially be split into two convenient blocks. As a poet his early work (such as 1921's ''Poemas puros; Poemillas de la ciudad'' and 1925's ''El viento y el verso'') is widely considered inferior to that of his fellow poets in the Generation of '27, and he himself acknowledged his limitations by referring to himself as a 'poeta de rachas' or 'part-time poet'. His mature work, however, particularly ''Hijos de la ira'' ('Children of Wrath', 1944, 2nd ed. 1946), is recognised as fundamental in the literature of the post-[[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]] years.

Alonso's later poetry is also full of agnostic anguish&mdash;of a man in search of god, yet fearful of the implications were this God not to exist.

As a literary critic Alonso's impact was substantial; in particular he is credited with revolutionizing the study of Spanish [[Baroque]] poetry, particularly the work of [[Luis de Góngora|Góngora]], and his critical work was praised for its intellectual rigour. Highlights include ''Poesía de San Juan de la Cruz'' (1942), ''Poesía española: Ensayo de métodos y límites estilísticos'' (1950) and ''Estudios y ensayos gongorinos'' (1955).

==Awards==
In 1978 Alonso was awarded the [[Premio Cervantes]], the Spanish literary world's highest honour.
