'''Roger Joseph Zelazny''' (May 13, 1937&nbsp;– June 14, 1995)<ref>{{cite news|work=[[The Independent]]|title=Obituary: Roger Zelazny|author=David Pringle|date=21 June 1995 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-roger-zelazny-1587694.html}}</ref> was an American poet and writer of [[fantasy]] and [[science fiction]] short stories and novels, best known for ''[[The Chronicles of Amber]]''.  He won the [[Nebula Award]] three times (out of 14 nominations) and the [[Hugo Award]] six times (also out of 14 nominations), including two Hugos for novels:  the serialized novel ''[[...And Call Me Conrad]]'' (1965), subsequently published under the title ''[[This Immortal]]'' (1966) and then the novel ''[[Lord of Light]]'' (1967).<ref name=SFAwards/>

==Biography==
Roger Joseph Zelazny was born in [[Euclid, Ohio]], the only child of Polish immigrant Joseph Frank Żelazny and [[Irish-American]] Josephine Flora Sweet. In high school, he became the editor of the school newspaper and joined the Creative Writing Club.<ref name="Roger Zelazny 2009" />  In the fall of 1955, he began attending [[Case Western Reserve University|Western Reserve University]] and graduated with a B.A. in English in 1959.<ref name="Roger Zelazny 2009" />  He was accepted to [[Columbia University]] in New York and specialized in Elizabethan and Jacobean drama, graduating with an M.A. in 1962.<ref name="Roger Zelazny 2009" />  His M.A. thesis was entitled ''Two traditions and [[Cyril Tourneur]]: an examination of morality and humor comedy conventions in [[The Revenger's Tragedy]].''

Between 1962 and 1969 he worked for the U.S. [[Social Security Administration]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], and then in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], spending his evenings writing science fiction.<ref name="Roger Zelazny 2009" /><ref name=AndCall />   He deliberately progressed from short-shorts to novelettes to novellas and finally to novel-length works by 1965.<ref name="Roger Zelazny 2009" />  On May 1, 1969, he quit to become a full-time writer, and thereafter concentrated on writing novels in order to maintain his income.<ref name=AndCall /> During this period, he was an active and vocal member of the Baltimore Science Fiction Society, whose members included writers [[Jack Chalker]] and [[Joe Haldeman|Joe]] and [[Jack Haldeman]] among others.

His first fanzine appearance was part one of the story "Conditional Benefit" (''Thurban 1'' #3, 1953) and his first professional publication and sale was the fantasy short story "Mr. Fuller's Revolt" (''Literary Calvalcade'', 1954).<ref name="Roger Zelazny 2009" />  As a professional writer, his debut works were the simultaneous publication of "Passion Play" (''Amazing'', August 1962) and "Horseman!" (''Fantastic'', August 1962).<ref name="Roger Zelazny 2009" />  "Passion Play" was written and sold first.<ref name="Roger Zelazny 2009" />  His first story to attract major attention was "[[A Rose for Ecclesiastes]]", published in ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction|The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction]]'', with cover art by [[Hannes Bok]].

Roger Zelazny was also a member of the [[Swordsmen and Sorcerers' Guild of America]] (SAGA), a loose-knit group of [[heroic fantasy]] authors founded in the 1960s, some of whose works were anthologized in [[Lin Carter]]'s ''[[Flashing Swords!]]'' anthologies.

Zelazny died in 1995, aged 58, of kidney failure secondary to colorectal cancer.<ref name="AndCall_a">"...And Call Me Roger": The Literary Life of Roger Zelazny, Part 6, by Christopher S. Kovacs. In: ''The Collected Stories of Roger Zelazny, Volume 6: The Road to Amber'', NESFA Press, 2009.</ref>

==Personal life==

Zelazny was married twice, first to Sharon Steberl in 1964 (divorced, no children), and then to Judith Alene Callahan in 1966. Prior to this he was engaged to folk singer [[Hedy West]] for six months from 1961 to 1962.<ref name="Roger Zelazny 2009">"...And Call Me Roger": The Literary Life of Roger Zelazny, Part 1, by Christopher S. Kovacs. In: ''The Collected Stories of Roger Zelazny, Volume 1: Threshold'', NESFA Press, 2009.</ref> Roger and Judith had two sons, Devin and [[Trent Zelazny|Trent]] (an author of [[crime fiction]]) and a daughter, Shannon. At the time of his death, Roger and Judith were separated and he was living with author [[Jane Lindskold]].<ref name=AndCall_a />

Raised as a [[Catholic]] by his parents,<ref name="Roger Zelazny 2009"/> Zelazny later declared himself a lapsed Catholic and remained that way for the rest of his life.<ref name="AndCall">"{{'}}...And Call Me Roger': The Literary Life of Roger Zelazny", Part 3, by Christopher S. Kovacs. In: ''The Collected Stories of Roger Zelazny, Volume 3: This Mortal Mountain'', NESFA Press, 2009.</ref> "I did have a strong Catholic background, but I am not a Catholic. Somewhere in the past, I believe I answered in the affirmative once for strange and complicated reasons. But I am not a member of any organized religion."<ref name="AndCall" />

Zelazny died in Santa Fe on June 16, 1995 of kidney failure associated with cancer. He was a twenty-year resident of Santa Fe then.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1995/06/16/science-fiction-luminary-roger-zelazny-dies-at-58 Zelazny obituary] at the [[Washington Post]], June 1995</ref>

==Themes==
In his stories, Roger Zelazny frequently portrayed characters from [[myth]], depicted in the modern or a future world. Zelazny included many anachronisms, such as cigarette-smoking and references to modern drama, in his work. His crisp, minimalistic dialogue also seems to be somewhat influenced by the style of wisecracking [[hardboiled]] crime authors, such as [[Raymond Chandler]] or [[Dashiell Hammett]]. The tension between the ancient and the modern, [[Surrealism|surreal]] and familiar was what drove most of his work.

A very frequent motif in Zelazny's work is [[immortality]] or [[Apotheosis|people who (have) become]] [[Deity|gods]] (as well as gods who have turned into people). The mythological traditions his fiction borrowed from include:

* [[Chinese mythology]], in ''[[Lord Demon]]'' (with Jane Lindskold)
* [[Egyptian mythology]], in ''[[Creatures of Light and Darkness]]''
* [[Greek mythology]], in ''[[This Immortal|...And Call Me Conrad]]''
* [[Hindu mythology]], in ''[[Lord of Light]]''
* [[Navajo mythology]], in ''[[Eye of Cat]]''
* [[Norse mythology]], in ''[[The Mask of Loki]]''
* [[Psychoanalysis]], [[King Arthur|Arthurian mythos]], [[Norse mythology]] and [[Kabbalah]], in ''[[The Dream Master]]''

Additionally, elements from [[Norse mythology|Norse]], [[Japanese mythology|Japanese]] and [[Irish mythology]], [[Arthurian legend]], and real [[history]] appear in ''[[The Chronicles of Amber]]''. ''[[A Night in the Lonesome October]]'' involves the [[Cthulhu Mythos]] in a similar vein.

Aside from working with mythological themes, the most common recurring motif of Zelazny's is the "absent father" (or father-figure). Again, this occurs most notably in the [[The Chronicles of Amber|Amber]] novels: in the first Amber series, the protagonist Corwin searches for his lost, god-like father [[Oberon]]; while in [[Chronicles of Amber#The Merlin Cycle|the second series]], which focuses on Corwin's son Merlin (not to be confused with the Arthurian [[Merlin]]), it is Corwin himself who is strangely missing. This somewhat [[Freud]]ian theme runs through almost every Zelazny novel to a smaller or larger degree. ''[[Roadmarks]]'', ''[[Doorways in the Sand]]'', ''[[Changeling (novel)|Changeling]]'', ''[[Madwand]]'', ''[[A Dark Traveling]]''; the short stories "Dismal Light", "Godson", "The Keys to December"; and the ''Alien Speedway'' series all feature main characters who are either searching for or have lost their fathers. Zelazny's father, Joseph, died unexpectedly in 1962 and never knew his son's successes as a writer; this event may have triggered Zelazny's unconscious and frequent use of the absent father motif.<ref>"...And Call Me Roger": The Literary Life of Roger Zelazny, Part 5, by Christopher S. Kovacs. In: ''The Collected Stories of Roger Zelazny, Volume 5: Nine Black Doves'', NESFA Press, 2009.</ref>

Two other personal characteristics that influenced his fiction were his expertise in [[martial arts]] and his addiction to tobacco. Zelazny became expert with the [[épée]] in college, and thus began a lifelong study of several different martial arts, including [[judo]], [[aikido]] (which he later taught as well, having gained a black belt), [[t'ai chi ch'uan|t'ai chi]], and [[Baguazhang|pa kua]]. In turn, many of his characters ably and knowledgeably use similar skills whilst dispatching their opponents. Zelazny was also a passionate cigarette and pipe [[smoking|smoker]] (until he quit in the early '80s), so much so, that he made many of his protagonists heavy smokers as well. However, he quit in order to improve his cardiovascular fitness for the martial arts; once he had quit, characters in his later novels and short stories stopped smoking too.<ref name="AndCall" />

Another characteristic of Zelazny's writing is that many of his protagonists had sufficient familiarity with other languages to be able to quote French, German, Italian or [[Latin]] aphorisms when the occasion seemed appropriate (or even inappropriate), although Zelazny himself did not speak any of those languages.

He also often [[Experimental literature|experimented with form]] in his stories. The novel ''[[Doorways in the Sand]]'' practices a flashback technique in which most chapters open with a scene, typically involving peril, not implied by the end of the previous chapter. Once the scene is established, the narrator backtracks to the events leading up to it, then follows through to the end of the chapter, whereupon the next chapter jumps ahead to another dramatic ''non-sequitur''.

In ''[[Roadmarks]]'', a novel about a road system that links all possible times, places and histories, the chapters that feature the protagonist are all titled "One". Other chapters, titled "Two", feature secondary characters, including original characters, [[pulp hero]]es, and real historical characters. The "One" storyline is fairly linear, whereas the "Two" storyline jumps around in time and sequence. After finishing the manuscript, Zelazny shuffled the "Two" chapters randomly among the "One" chapters in order to emphasize their non-linear nature relative to the storyline.<ref name="AndCall_b">"...And Call Me Roger": The Literary Life of Roger Zelazny, Part 4, by Christopher S. Kovacs. In: ''The Collected Stories of Roger Zelazny, Volume 4: Last Exit to Babylon'', NESFA Press, 2009.</ref>

''[[Creatures of Light and Darkness]]'', featuring characters in the personae of Egyptian gods, uses a narrative voice entirely in the [[present tense]]; the final chapter is structured as a [[play (theatre)|play]], and several chapters take the form of long poems.

Zelazny also tended to write a short fragment, not intended for publication, as a kind of backstory for a major character, as a way of giving that character a life independent of the particular novel being worked on. At least one "fragment" was published, the short story ''Dismal Light'', originally a backstory for ''[[Isle of the Dead (Zelazny novel)|Isle of the Dead]]''{{'}}s Francis Sandow. Sandow himself figures little in ''Dismal Light'', the main character being his son, who is delaying his escape from an unstable star system in order to force his distant father to come in and ask him personally. While ''Isle of the Dead'' has Sandow living a life of irresponsible luxury as an escape from his personal demons, "Dismal Light" anchors his character as one who will face up to his responsibilities, however reluctantly.

Another common stylistic approach in his novels is the use of ''mixed genres'', whereby elements of each are combined freely and interchangeably. ''[[Jack of Shadows]]'' and ''[[Changeling (novel)|Changeling]]'', for example, revolve around the tensions between the two worlds of magic and technology. ''[[Lord of Light]]'', perhaps one of his most famous works, is written in the classic style of a mythic fantasy, while it is established early in the book that the story itself takes place on a [[Space colonization|colonized planet]].<ref>"...And Call Me Roger"": The Literary Life of Roger Zelazny, Part 2, by Christopher S. Kovacs. In: ''The Collected Stories of Roger Zelazny, Volume 2: Power & Light'', NESFA Press, 2009.</ref>

Many of Zelazny's works explore variations upon the idea that if there exists an infinite number of worlds, then every world that can be imagined must exist, somewhere. Powerful beings in many of his stories have the ability to travel to worlds that possess precisely the characteristics which that being wishes to experience.  (Zelazny characters with this ability include Thoth in ''[[Creatures of Light and Darkness]]'', who teleports to these worlds; those with the royal blood of either Amber or Chaos in ''[[The Chronicles of Amber]]'', who "move through shadows" to reach these worlds; the guardian families of ''[[A Dark Traveling]]'', who move between realities using high-tech devices; and Red Dorakeen in ''[[Roadmarks]]'', who reaches these worlds by driving along a magical highway.)  Many of these same characters wonder whether they are creating these special places anew, or are merely finding places which already exist (very much like "[[the problem of universals]]" in classical [[metaphysics]]). Usually each character who ponders this ultimately decides that the question is purely academic and therefore unanswerable.

==Legacy==
Zelazny's stories inspired other authors in his generation including [[Samuel R. Delany]], whose novel ''[[Nova (novel)|Nova]]'' and many of his short stories were written "partly in response to Zelazny’s eruption into the field."<ref name="tor.com">"[http://www.tor.com/2012/11/11/something-else-like-roger-zelazny/ Something Else Like ... Roger Zelazny]" by Jo Walton, [[Tor.com]], November 11, 2012.</ref> In 1967 [[Algis Budrys]] listed Zelazny, Delany, [[J. G. Ballard]], and [[Brian W. Aldiss]] as "an earthshaking new kind of" writers, and leaders of the [[New Wave (science fiction)|New Wave]].<ref name="budrys196710">{{Cite magazine

==Awards==
Zelazny won at least 16 awards for particular works of fiction: six [[Hugo Awards]], three [[Nebula Awards]], two [[Locus Award]]s, one [[Prix Tour-Apollo Award]], two [[Seiun Award]]s, and two [[Balrog Award]]s – very often Zelazny's works competed with each other for the same award.<ref name=SFAwards/>
