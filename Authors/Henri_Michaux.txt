'''Henri Michaux''' ({{IPA-fr|miʃo|lang}}; 24 May 1899 – 19 October 1984) was a Belgian-born French poet, writer and painter. Michaux is best known for his poetry and prose, especially his texts chronicling his [[Psychoactive drug|psychedelic]] experiments with [[LSD]] and [[mescaline]] which include ''Miserable Miracle'' and ''The Major Ordeals of the Mind and the Countless Minor Ones'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/aug/10/featuresreviews.guardianreview18|title=Journeys into the Abyss|first=Octavio|last=Paz|date=9 August 2002|work=The Guardian|access-date=20 November 2016|archive-date=21 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161121044645/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/aug/10/featuresreviews.guardianreview18|url-status=live}}</ref> as well as his idiosyncratic [[Travel literature|travelogues]] and books of [[art criticism]].

==Biography==
===Travels===
In 1930 and 1931, Michaux visited Japan, China and India. The result of this trip was the book ''A Barbarian in Asia''.<ref>[https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/henri-michaux/a-barbarian-in-asia/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190226172904/https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/henri-michaux/a-barbarian-in-asia/ |date=26 February 2019 }} {{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/henri-michaux/a-barbarian-in-asia/|title=A Barbarian in Asia|access-date=2019-02-26|archive-date=26 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190226172904/https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/henri-michaux/a-barbarian-in-asia/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>[https://www.ndbooks.com/book/a-barbarian-in-asia/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190226111409/https://www.ndbooks.com/book/a-barbarian-in-asia/ |date=26 February 2019 }} {{cite web|url=https://www.ndbooks.com/book/a-barbarian-in-asia/|title=A Barbarian in Asia|date=31 May 2016|access-date=2019-02-26|archive-date=26 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190226111409/https://www.ndbooks.com/book/a-barbarian-in-asia/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1949/06/05/110059297.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211106220601/https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1949/06/05/110059297.html |date=6 November 2021 }} {{cite web|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1949/06/05/110059297.html|title=The World of Michaux|access-date=2019-02-26|archive-date=6 November 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211106220601/https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1949/06/05/110059297.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Asian culture became one of his biggest influences. The philosophy of Buddhism and calligraphy later became principal subjects of many of his poems and inspired many of his drawings. He also visited [[Ecuador]] and published a travelogue book of the same name.<ref>[http://www.nupress.northwestern.edu/content/ecuador] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190226172757/http://www.nupress.northwestern.edu/content/ecuador |date=26 February 2019 }} {{cite web | url=http://www.nupress.northwestern.edu/content/ecuador | title=Ecuador | access-date=2019-02-26 | archive-date=26 February 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190226172757/http://www.nupress.northwestern.edu/content/ecuador | url-status=live }}</ref> His travels across the Americas finished in Brazil in 1939, and he stayed there for two years.

Michaux is also known for his stories about Plume – "a peaceful man" – perhaps the most unenterprising hero in the history of literature, and his many misfortunes. In 1955 he became a citizen of France,<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Henri-Michaux] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190226111539/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Henri-Michaux |date=26 February 2019 }} {{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Henri-Michaux |title=Henri Michaux, French painter and poet |access-date=26 February 2019 |archive-date=26 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190226111539/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Henri-Michaux |url-status=live }}</ref> and he lived the rest of his life there along with his family. He became a mutual friend of Romanian pessimist philosopher and French citizen [[Emil Cioran]] around the same time.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MulQs9V7o_M |title=Emil Cioran - A Century of Writers (1999) {{!}} Türkçe Altyazılı - YouTube<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=28 October 2021 |archive-date=28 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211028063856/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MulQs9V7o_M |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1965 he won the [[grand prix national des Lettres]], which he refused to accept.

===Visual arts===
Michaux was an idiosyncratic visual artist, associated with the [[Tachiste]] movement in the 1940s and 50s. His work often makes use of dense, suggestively gestural strokes that incorporates elements of calligraphy, [[asemic writing]], and [[abstract expressionism]]. The [[Musée National d'Art Moderne|Museum of Modern Art]] in Paris and the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] in New York both had major shows of his work in 1978.
