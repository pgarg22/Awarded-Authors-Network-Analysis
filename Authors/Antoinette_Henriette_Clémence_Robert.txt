==Biography==
Mlle Robert was born in [[Mâcon]] in December 1797. She was a strong student with a penchant for history.<ref name="scrapbook">{{Cite book |year=1907 |title=The Scrap Book, Volume II: September, 1906 to February, 1907 |location=New York |publisher=The Frank A. Munsey Company |page=151 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9kVSAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA150 |access-date=11 January 2014}}</ref> Her first published work was ''Cri de joie d’une Française sur la naissance de SAR Mgr le duc de Bordeaux'' (Mme Ve Porthmann 1820). Her father was a deputy judge in Mâcon. When he died in 1830, the year of the [[July Revolution]], she moved to Paris for the society of other women writers, and to reunite with her older brother (esteemed clockmaker Henri Robert).<ref name="Vapereau">{{cite book |editor-last = Vapereau |editor-first = Louis Gustave |editor-link = Louis Gustave Vapereau |title = Dictionnaire universel des contemporains |trans-title=Universal Dictionary of Contemporaries |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=F_0-AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA1523 |access-date = 11 January 2014 |volume = 2 (L–Z) |year = 1858 |publisher = [[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette Livre]] |location  = Paris |language = fr |oclc = 229946820 |pages = 1552–3}}</ref> In her early days in Paris, she worked in a library. In 1845 she retired to the quiet of [[Abbaye-aux-Bois]], a Catholic convent that also let rooms to women of high social standing; soon, however, she returned to her career.<ref name="scrapbook"/><ref name="Vapereau"/> Her stay there coincided with a major literary [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] hosted by her friends [[François-René de Chateaubriand]] and [[Juliette Récamier]], in Mlle Récamier's quarters at the abbey. Clémence Robert died in Paris in 1872, five days before her 75th birthday.

While contemporary novelists drifted toward [[escapist fiction]], her historical novels revisited themes of socialism and ''[[républicanisme]]''. Her views were shaped in part by the work of anti-Catholic socialist [[Eugène Sue]] (1804–1857).<ref name="Olivier-Martin"/><ref name="scrapbook"/><ref>{{Cite book |last=Cowen |first=David |editor-last=Unwin |editor-first=Timothy |title=The Cambridge Companion to the French Novel: From 1800 to the Present |chapter=Popular Fiction in the Nineteenth Century |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mIq99LRgKw8C&pg=PA80 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=80 |isbn=9780521499149 |oclc=36084649 |access-date=11 January 2014|date=1997-10-28 }}</ref>

With Camille Leynadier, she compiled and edited the [[memoir]]s of [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], which they presented as a biography, dramatised in parts. Her most famous short story was "Baron de Trenck", which relates an adventure of the Prussian officer [[Friedrich von der Trenck]], and was inspired by his widely published autobiography.
