'''Leon Marcus Uris''' (August 3, 1924 – June 21, 2003) was an American author of historical fiction who wrote many bestselling books including ''[[Exodus (Uris novel)|Exodus]]'' (published in 1958) and ''[[Trinity (novel)|Trinity]]'' (published in 1976).<ref>"Author Leon Uris Dies at 78", ''The Elyria (Ohio) Chronicle Telegram'', June 25, 
2003, p. A8.</ref>

==Life and career==
Uris was born in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], the son of [[Jewish American]] parents Wolf William and Anna (née Blumberg) Uris. His father, a [[Polish Jews|Polish]]-born immigrant, was a [[wallpaper|paperhanger]], then a storekeeper. His mother was first-generation [[Russian American]].<ref>Congressional Record, p. 16911</ref> William spent a year in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] after [[World War I]] before entering the United States. He derived his last name from Yerushalmi, meaning "man of [[Jerusalem]]". (His brother Aron, Leon's uncle, took the name Yerushalmi.) "He was basically a failure", Uris later said of his father. "I think his personality was formed by the harsh realities of being a [[Russian Jews|Jew in]] [[Russian Empire|Czarist Russia]]. I think failure formed his character, made him bitter."<ref name="AP">{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20030624/ai_n11400762|title=Leon Uris, author of 'Exodus', novel of founding of Israel, and other|access-date=August 11, 2010 |publisher=Deseret News|author=Hillel Italie AP national|format=news|date=June 2003}}</ref>

At age six, Uris reportedly wrote an operetta inspired by the death of his dog. He attended schools in [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], [[Virginia]], and Baltimore, but never graduated from high school, and failed English three times. When he was 17 and in his senior year of high school, the Japanese attacked [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] and he enlisted in the [[United States Marine Corps]]. He served in the [[Pacific War|South Pacific]] with the [[2nd Battalion, 6th Marine Regiment|2nd Battalion, 6th Marines]], where he was stationed in New Zealand, and fought as a radioman in combat on [[Guadalcanal]] and [[Tarawa Atoll|Tarawa]]<ref name="NYTBio">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/section/movies|title=Movies|access-date=February 10, 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> from 1942 through 1944. He was sent to the US after suffering from [[dengue fever]], [[malaria]] and a recurrence of [[asthma]] that made him miss the devastation of his battalion at [[Saipan]], which was featured in ''[[Battle Cry (Leon Uris novel)|Battle Cry]]''.<ref>Nadel, Ira B. ''Leon Uris: Life of a Best Seller'' University of Texas Press, September 24, 2010</ref> While recuperating from [[malaria]] in San Francisco, he met Betty Beck, a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] sergeant; they married in 1945.

Released from service he worked for a newspaper, and wrote in his spare time. ''[[Esquire Magazine|Esquire]]'' magazine bought an article in 1950, and he began to devote himself to writing more seriously. Drawing on his experiences in Guadalcanal and Tarawa, he produced the best-selling ''Battle Cry'', a novel depicting the toughness and courage of U.S. Marines in the Pacific. He then went to [[Warner Brothers]] in Hollywood helping to write the [[Battle Cry (film)|eponymous movie]] which was extremely popular with the public, but not the critics.<ref name="NYTBio"/> He went on to write ''[[The Angry Hills]]'', a novel set in war-time [[Greece]].

His best-known work may be ''[[Exodus (Uris novel)|Exodus]]'', which was published in 1958. Most sources indicate that Uris, motivated by an intense interest in Israel, financed his research for the novel by selling the film rights in advance to [[MGM]] and by writing newspaper articles about the [[Suez Crisis|Sinai campaign]],<ref>[http://www.ncsj.org/AuxPages/062503NYTimes_Uris.shtml ''Leon Uris,  78, Who Wrote Sweeping Novels Like ''"Exodus,"'' Dies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100101155202/http://www.ncsj.org/AuxPages/062503NYTimes_Uris.shtml |date=January 1, 2010 }} [[New York Times]] – June 25, 2003</ref><ref name="Fujiwara">{{cite book|title=The World and Its Double: The Life and Work of Otto Preminger|page=255|author=Chris Fujiwara|isbn=978-0-86547-995-1|year=2009 |publisher=Faber & Faber}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=lM-8-isjOYgC&pg=PA255&dq=Leon+Uris+-inauthor:%22Leon+Uris%22&lr=&as_brr=3&ei=tTs0S8HpPJOElQTRiaDMAQ&cd=34#v=onepage&q=Leon%20Uris%20-inauthor%3A%22Leon%20Uris%22&f=false]</ref><ref name="Erens">{{cite book|title=The Jew in American Cinema|page=217|author=Patricia Erens|publisher=Indiana University Press, 1988|isbn=978-0-86547-995-1|date=March 3, 2009}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=-v2Di_5ShGMC&pg=PA217&dq=Leon+Uris+-inauthor:%22Leon+Uris%22&lr=&as_brr=3&ei=okA0S8r7Fo3uzQSC19nKAQ&cd=55#v=onepage&q=Leon%20Uris%20-inauthor%3A%22Leon%20Uris%22&f=false]</ref> which is said to have involved two years of research, and thousands of interviews.<ref name="Shatzky">{{cite book|title=Contemporary Jewish-American Novelists: A Bio-Critical Sourcebook|url=https://archive.org/details/contemporaryjewi00shat|url-access=limited|page=[https://archive.org/details/contemporaryjewi00shat/page/n472 440]|author=Joel Shatzky|author2=Michael Taub |isbn=0-313-29462-3|year=1994|publisher=Greenwood Press}}</ref> It was a worldwide best-seller, translated into a dozen languages, and was made into a [[Exodus (1960 film)|feature film]] in 1960, starring [[Paul Newman]], directed by [[Otto Preminger]], as well as into a short-lived Broadway musical, ''Ari'', in 1971, for which Uris wrote the book and lyrics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=3579 |title=Ari |work=Internet Broadway Database |access-date=December 1, 2018}}</ref>

Two typewritten Russian translations were circulated as samizdat – illegal, hand-copied works that were passed secretly from hand to hand – and the story was retold orally in the prison camps, with the oral version eventually being written in a notebook which was passed from one generation of prisoners to the next.<ref>Beckerman, Gal, When They Come for Us We'll Be Gone, pp. 27-29</ref>

According to [[Jack Shaheen]], Americans were largely apathetic about Israel in the 1950s, so the eminent public relations consultant Edward Gottlieb was called on "to create a more sympathetic attitude" toward the newly established state, and sent Leon Uris to Israel to write ''Exodus'', a novel peopled with heroic Israelis and sleazy, brutal Arabs, some of whom are linked with ex-Nazis, to introduce readers to the Arab–Israel conflict.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w4htAAAAMAAJ|title=Fifty years of Israel|last=Neff|first=Donald|date=June 1998|publisher=American Educational Trust|isbn=9780937165089|pages=19|quote=In the early 1950s, an American public relations man, Edward Gottlieb, seeking to improve Israel's image in the United States, hit upon the idea of hiring a writer to go to Israel and write an heroic novel about the new country. The writer was Leon Uris, and his novel, Exodus, became a huge best-seller. Moreover, the highly romanticized novel later became a movie starring Paul Newman. It was a box office smash hit.}}</ref> However, this account of ''Exodus'''s creation has been disputed, and the story may have been invented by a PLO spokesperson.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/martinkramer/files/exodus_conspiracy.pdf |title=The War on Error: Israel, Islam, and the Middle East; The Exodus Conspiracy |last=Kramer |first=Martin |year=2016 |publisher=Routledge |location=New Brunswick, NJ |pages=245–252 |format=pdf |isbn=978-1412864992}}</ref>

Uris's 1967 novel ''[[Topaz (novel)|Topaz]]'' was [[Topaz (1969 film)|adapted for the screen]] and directed by [[Alfred Hitchcock]] in 1969.<ref name="Ransom">{{cite web|url=http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/ransomedition/2003/fall/exodus.html|title=Leon Uris's Exodus|access-date=January 16, 2010|publisher=Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas at Austin|work=Fall 2003 Newsletter, Obituary|first=Travis |last=Willmann |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501003708/http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/ransomedition/2003/fall/exodus.html|archive-date=May 1, 2009}}</ref> His subsequent works included ''[[Mila 18]]'', about the [[Warsaw ghetto]] uprising; ''[[Armageddon: A Novel of Berlin]]'', a chronicle which ends with the lifting of the Berlin Blockade in 1949; ''[[Trinity (novel)|Trinity]]'', about [[History of Ireland (1801-1922)|Irish nationalism]], and the sequel, ''[[Redemption (Uris novel)|Redemption]]'', covering the early 20th century and [[World War I]].

''[[QB VII]]'', about the role of a Polish doctor in a German [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]], is a dramatic four-part courtroom novel published in 1970, highlighting the events leading to a libel trial in the United Kingdom. It is loosely based on a court case for defamation (''[[Dering v Uris]]'') that arose from Uris's earlier best-selling novel ''[[Exodus (Uris novel)|Exodus]]'', and was Uris's second consecutive #1 [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller]]. ''[[The Haj (novel)|The Haj]]'' was set in the history of the Middle East. He also wrote the screenplays for ''[[Battle Cry (film)|Battle Cry]]'' and ''[[Gunfight at the O.K.
