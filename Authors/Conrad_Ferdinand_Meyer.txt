'''Conrad Ferdinand Meyer''' (11 October 1825 – 28 November 1898) was a Swiss [[poet]] and [[historical novel]]ist,<ref name=Collier's/> a master of [[literary realism]] who is mainly remembered for stirring narrative ballads like "Die Füße im Feuer" (The Feet in the Fire).

Meyer was born in [[Zurich (city)|Zürich]]. He was of [[patricianship|patrician]] descent. His father, who died early, was a statesman and historian, while his mother was a highly cultured woman. Throughout his childhood two traits were observed that later characterized the man and the poet: he had a most scrupulous regard for neatness and cleanliness, and he lived and experienced more deeply in memory than in the immediate present.<ref name=Burns/> He suffered from bouts of mental illness, sometimes requiring hospitalization; his mother, similarly but more severely afflicted, killed herself.

Having finished the [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]], he took up the study of law, but history and the humanities were of greater interest to him.<ref name=Burns/> He went for considerable periods to [[Lausanne]], [[Geneva]], [[Paris]], and [[Italy]], where he interested himself in historical research. The two historians who influenced Meyer particularly were [[Louis Vulliemin]] at Lausanne and [[Jacob Burckhardt]] at [[Basel]], whose book on the ''Culture of the Renaissance'' stimulated his imagination and interest. From his travels in France and Italy (1857) Meyer derived much inspiration for the settings and characters of his historical novels.<ref name=Americana/> In 1875, he settled at [[Kilchberg, Zurich|Kilchberg]], above Zürich.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|wstitle=Meyer, Konrad Ferdinand|inline=1}}</ref>

Meyer found his calling only late in life; for many years, being practically bilingual, he wavered between French and German. The [[Franco-Prussian War]] brought the final decision. In Meyer's novels, a great crisis often releases latent energies and precipitates a catastrophe. In the same manner, his own life which before the war had been one of dreaming and experimenting, was stirred to the very depths by the events of 1870. Meyer identified himself with the German cause, and as a manifesto of his sympathies published the little epic ''Hutten's Last Days'' in 1871.<ref name=Americana/> After that his works appeared in rapid succession.<ref name=Burns/>

In 1880, he received an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Zurich]]. He died in his home in [[Kilchberg, Zurich|Kilchberg]] on 28 November 1898.<ref name=Burns/>

==Works==
His works were collected into eight volumes in 1912.

===Novels===
The periods of the [[Renaissance]] and [[Counter Reformation]] furnished the subjects for most of his novels. Most of his plots spring from the deeper conflict between freedom and fate and culminate in a dramatic crisis in which the hero, in the face of a great temptation, loses his moral freedom and is forced to fulfill the higher law of destiny.<ref name=Americana/>

===Legacy===

It is as a master of narrative [[ballads]], often on historical themes, that Meyer is mostly remembered. His fiction also typically focuses on key historical moments from the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Reformation]] and [[Counter-Reformation]].

Meyer's lyric verse is almost entirely the product of his later years.<ref name=Burns>Friedrich Burns, ed., [https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8565 ''A Book of German Lyrics''] (Project Gutenberg). {{PD-notice}}</ref> He frequently celebrated human handiwork, especially works of art. [[Rome]] and the monumental work of [[Michelangelo]] were among decisive experiences in his life.
