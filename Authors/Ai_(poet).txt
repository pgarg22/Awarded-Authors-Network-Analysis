== Early life ==
Ai, who described herself as 1/2 [[Japanese people|Japanese]], 1/8 [[Choctaw]]-[[Chickasaw]], 1/4 [[African Americans|Black]], 1/16 [[Irish people|Irish]], Southern [[Cheyenne]], and [[Comanche]], was born in [[Albany, Texas]],<ref name=CAO /><ref name=CWP /><ref name=CP /><ref name=NYT /><ref name="auto">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/28/books/28ai.html|title=Ai, an Unflinching Poetic Channel of Hard Lives, Dies at 62|last=Fox|first=Margalit|date=2010-03-27|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-03-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://poetrycenter.arizona.edu/exhibits/poet-ai.shtml |title=University of Arizona Poetry Center |website=poetrycenter.arizona.edu |access-date=2016-03-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116181446/http://poetrycenter.arizona.edu/exhibits/poet-ai.shtml |archivedate=2016-01-16 }}</ref> in 1947, and grew up in [[Tucson, Arizona]]. She spent time also in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and San Francisco, living with her mother and second stepfather, Sutton Haynes. In 1959, a couple of years after her mother's divorce from Hayes, they moved back to Tucson, Arizona, where she completed high school and attended college at the University of Arizona, where she majored in English and Oriental Studies with a concentration in Japanese and a minor in Creative Writing, to which she would fully commit toward the end of her degree.<ref name="awpwriter.org">{{Cite web|url=https://www.awpwriter.org/magazine_media/writers_chronicle_view/2547/an_interview_with_ai|title=AWP: Writer's Chronicle Features Archive|website=www.awpwriter.org|access-date=2016-03-21}}</ref> Before starting college, one night during dinner with her mother and third stepfather, Ai learned her biological father was Japanese. Known as Florence Hayes throughout her childhood and undergrad years, it was not until graduate school, when Ai was going to switch her last name back to Anthony, that her mother finally told her more details about her past, learning that she had an affair with a Japanese man, Michael Ogawa, after meeting him at a streetcar stop. Learning of the affair had led Ai's first stepfather, whose last name was "Anthony," to beat her mother until family intervened and she was taken to Texas, where her stepfather eventually followed after Ai's birth. Because her mother was still legally married to Anthony at the time, his last name was put on Ai's birth certificate.<ref name="The Pedestal Magazine Links">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thepedestalmagazine.com/gallery.php?item=738 |title=The Pedestal Magazine > Links |website=www.thepedestalmagazine.com |access-date=2016-03-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304190540/http://www.thepedestalmagazine.com/gallery.php?item=738 |archivedate=2016-03-04 }}</ref>

The poverty Ai experienced during her childhood affected her and her writing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/ai/kearney.htm|title=Ai Interviewed by Lawrence Kearney and Michael Cuddihy|website=www.english.illinois.edu|access-date=2016-03-21}}</ref> Ai credits her first writing experience to an assignment in her Catholic school English class to write a letter from the perspective of a martyr. Two years after that experience, she began actively writing at the age of 14.<ref name="awpwriter.org"/> History had been one of her many interests since high school.<ref name="The Pedestal Magazine Links"/>

== Career ==
From 1969 to 1971, Ai attended the University of California at Irvine's M.F.A program where she worked under the likes of [[Charles Wright (poet)|Charles Wright]] and [[Donald Justice]].<ref name="awpwriter.org"/><ref name="The Pedestal Magazine Links"/> She is the author of ''No Surrender'', (2010), which was published after her death, ''Dread'' (W. W. Norton & Co., 2003); ''Vice'' (1999), which won the National Book Award;<ref name=nba1999/> ''Greed'' (1993); ''Fate'' (1991); ''Sin'' (1986), which won an American Book Award from the Before Columbus Foundation; ''Killing Floor'' (1979), which was the 1978 [[Lamont Poetry Selection]] of the [[Academy of American Poets]]; and ''Cruelty'' (1973).

She also received awards from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]], the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], the Bunting Fellowship Program at [[Radcliffe College]] and from various universities.

== Literary views/interviews ==
{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2020}}
Ai Ogawa considered herself as "simply a writer" rather than a spokesperson for any particular group.<ref>"Ai," ''American Poetry Observed'', edited by Joe David Bellamy.  University of Illinois Press: Urbana, 1984, pp. 1–8; quoted statement is on page 5.</ref> About her own poetry in an interview with Lawrence Kearney and Michael Cuddihy in 1978, she emphasized that there are no "confessional" or autobiographical elements in her work. However, in an interview with Okla Elliott in 2003 after the publication of ''Dread'', she stated that some of the poems and characters in that book are "fictionalized versions" of her family history and that her multi-racial background and interest in history has had a strong influence on her work in this particular collection.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.thepedestalmagazine.com/gallery.php?item=738|title=The Pedestal Magazine > Links|website=archive.thepedestalmagazine.com}}</ref>

In a 1999 interview, Ai was asked about the topics she uses in her writings, such as child abuse, necrophilia, and murder. When asked by interviewer Elizabeth Farnsworth why she chooses to write on these topics, Ai replied that “it’s really the characters, because [she] write[s] monologues” (Farnsworth).<ref>Farnsworth, Elizabeth. A 1999 PBS Interview with Ai. Modern American Poetry, 24 March 2015, 
https://www.modernamericanpoetry.org/content/1999-pbs-interview-ai. Accessed 02 Nov. 2019.
</ref> She also spoke about her choice of characters that “there’s a lot more to talk about with the scoundrels” (Farnsworth).

In that same interview,  Farnsworth commented on the fact that even though Ai's poetry is written in first person, she is “almost always someone else” (Farnsworth). Ai also told Farnsworth that her “first poetry teacher said that when you wrote in the first person, that your work was often stronger” (Farnsworth). Throughout her writing career, Ai eventually realized that her “poems that were written in the first person were the strongest” (Farnsworth). She also told Farnsworth that she considers herself an “actor” and that is how she is able to successfully write as other characters.

Farnsworth asked Ai about her poem about Jimmy Hoffa- “Jimmy Hoffa’s Odyssey.” Ai told Farnsworth that she got the idea from watching a The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. Carson had told a joke that inspired Ai to write the poem. After she decided to write the poem, she found a biography on Hoffa and studied it before writing the piece. Ai said that she often reads biographies before writing a poem on an historical figure.

While her work often contains sex, violence, and other controversial subjects, she told Kearney and Cuddihy during that 1978 interview that she did not view her use of them as gratuitous. Concerning the poems in her first collection, ''Cruelty'', she said: "I wanted people to see how they treated each other and themselves." She noted that the difference between the poems in ''Cruelty'' and those in ''Killing Floor'' is that they deal with her character's whole life rather than a single episode. She described her purpose for writing as "trying to integrate [her] life emotionally and spiritually."<ref name="english.illinois.edu"/>

When Ai was asked why she thought her work was so “edgy and dark”, Ai stated that “violence is an integral part of American culture” (Farnsworth). She tries to deal with that in her writing, which is something she said she has been working on her whole life. She said that “she was not able to deal with violence in [her] work” early in her writing career, and that was something she intentionally set out to do.

About contemporary American poetry and her own risk-taking in her work she said: "Perhaps there's a fear of revealing too much emotion in American poetry, despite the go-ahead of a sort from confessional poetry. At any rate, I think that that is my goal—I mean I never want to say 'I have plenty of heart,' but I want to be able to say whatever I feel without fear or embarrassment."<ref name="english.illinois.edu"/>

== Name change ==
In 1973, she legally changed her last name to Ogawa and her middle name to "Ai" (愛), which translates to "love" in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], a pen name she had been using since 1969.<ref name="The Pedestal Magazine Links"/>

== Death ==
Ai was checked into the hospital on March 17, 2010, for [[pneumonia]]. Three days later, Ai died on March 20, 2010, at age 62, in [[Stillwater, Oklahoma]],<ref name="auto"/> from complications of stage 4 [[breast cancer]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://haydensferryreview.com/haydensferryreview/2010/03/remembering-poet-ai.html|title=Contributor Spotlight: Carolyne Wright Remembers Poet Ai|website=Hayden's Ferry Review|access-date=2016-03-21}}</ref><ref name="auto"/>
