'''Václav Kliment Klicpera''' (23 November 1792 &ndash; 15 September 1859) was a [[Czechoslovakia|Czech]] [[playwright]], author, and poet. He was one of the first presenters of Czech [[drama]], and was especially influential in the foundation of [[comedy|comedic]] [[Theatre of the Czech Republic|Czech theatre]].

Klicpera was born in [[Chlumec nad Cidlinou]]. After graduating from a [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] (a European secondary school) in 1813, he moved to [[Prague]].  There he studied [[philosophy]] in 1816 and [[medicine]] in 1818. In June 1819 he was made a professor at a gymnasium in [[Hradec Králové]]. In 1850 he became [[schoolmaster]] of a [[Prague]] gymnasium.

He was skilled in writing [[chivalric]] plays and patriotically-themed historical dramas that became the foundation of modern Czech drama. He is also recognized for his [[farce]]s (in Czech ''frašky''), in the Plautine tradition. He also wrote historical romance stories, plays from his own era, and plays with [[fairy tale]] motifs. Klicpera supported the advancement of Czech theatre through the publication of plays in the ''Klicpera's theatre'' edition.

He died in Prague and is buried in the city's [[Olšany Cemetery]].
