Referred to as "[[elf]]s" by some humans, they refer to themselves as "human." The Dragaeran Empire controls a region that is "enclouded" by a perpetual overcast that blocks the sun from view.

Vlad Taltos is one of the human minority (known by Dragaerans as "Easterners"), which exists as a lower class in the Empire. Vlad also practices the human art of witchcraft; "[[táltos]]" is Hungarian for a kind of supernatural person in folklore.  Though human, he is a citizen of the Empire because his social-climbing father bought a title in one of the less reputable of the 17 Dragaeran Great Houses. The only Great House that sells memberships this way is, not coincidentally, also the one that maintains a criminal organization.  Vlad proves surprisingly successful in this organization.  Despite being a human and a criminal, he has a number of high-ranking Dragaeran friends and often gets caught up in important events.

Brust has written 15 published novels in the series, which is proposed to run to nineteen novels&nbsp;– one named for each of the Great Houses, one named for Vlad himself (''[[Taltos (Steven Brust novel)|Taltos]]''), and a final novel which Brust has said will be titled ''The Final Contract''{{Citation needed|reason=Only reference I can find is on a fan page (http://www.panix.com/~alexx/future.txt) referencing an article that is no longer available.|date=July 2019}}.  The first three novels resemble private-eye [[detective fiction|detective stories]], perhaps the closest being [[Robert B. Parker]]'s [[Spenser (fictional detective)|Spenser series]].  The later novels are more varied than the first three.  Though they read like fantasy, there are science-fictional explanations for some things.

Brust has also written another series set in Dragaera, the ''[[Khaavren Romances]]'', set centuries before Vlad's time.  Since Dragaerans live for thousands of years, many characters appear in both series.  It is partly an homage to [[Alexandre Dumas père]]'s novels about [[The Three Musketeers]], and is five volumes long, following the pattern of Dumas' series.  The books are presented as historical novels written by Paarfi of Roundwood, a Dragaeran roughly contemporary with Vlad.  Paarfi's old-fashioned, elaborate, and highly verbose writing is explicitly based on Dumas', though with a dialogue style that is, at times, based on [[Tom Stoppard]]'s wordgames in ''[[Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead]]'' (according to Pamela Dean's introduction to ''Five Hundred Years After'').
''[[The Baron of Magister Valley]]'', an additional Paarfi novel, is modeled after Dumas's ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]''.

The two series are finally brought together in the thirteenth novel in the Vlad series, ''Tiassa'', which can also be viewed as the sixth novel in the Khaavren series. ''Tiassa'' comprises what are in effect three related novellas, each told in a different style and connected by a common theme. The first section reads like the first three novels in the series, with first-person narration by Vlad but including Khaavren's son, Piro; the second section has a different viewpoint character in each of its chapters; and the third section is narrated by Paarfi in the style of the earlier ''Khaavren Romances'', with Khaavren as the viewpoint character and interacting with Vlad.

===Short stories===
Most of Brust's short stories are set in [[shared universe]]s.  These include [[Emma Bull]]'s and [[Will Shetterly]]'s ''[[Liavek]]'', [[Robert Asprin]]'s ''[[Thieves' World]]'', [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[Sandman (Vertigo)|Sandman]]'' and [[Terri Windling]]'s ''[[The Borderland Series|Borderland Series]]''.

===Style and literary theory===
Brust was a founding member of a Minnesota-based writers' group called [[The Scribblies]], which included [[Emma Bull]], [[Pamela Dean]], [[Will Shetterly]], Nate Bucklin, [[Kara Dalkey]], and [[Patricia Wrede]]. He also was a founding member of the [[Pre-Joycean Fellowship]].

He has rejected a distinction between science fiction and fantasy, stating that no belief in such a distinction can withstand an encounter with the writing of [[Roger Zelazny]].<ref name="brust20160229">{{Cite web |last=Brust |first=Steven |date=February 29, 2016 |title=No belief in a distinction between science fiction and fantasy can withstand an encounter with Zelazny. #justsaying |url=https://twitter.com/StevenBrust/status/704353038060752896 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309164141/https://twitter.com/StevenBrust/status/704353038060752896 |archive-date=March 9, 2016 |website=Steven Brust on Twitter |publisher=Twitter.com}}</ref>

==== Writing style ====
There is a certain amount of variation in the writing style amongst the Taltos novels, as well as between Brust's various series. Brust uses a different narrative approach in almost every novel in the Taltos series. Some of these approaches are more purely stylistic and have minor effects on the actual story-telling; some are profound and involve the point of view of characters whom the reader never expected to get to know so well.

Further, as the writing of the Taltos novels has spanned over three decades, they have been influenced by events in Brust's own life. A fascination with the Mafia&nbsp;– subsequently brought into a somewhat shocking perspective by the murder of a friend&nbsp;– profoundly influenced his storylines, as did the breakup of his marriage. The events and arguments of his books, especially ''Teckla'', are acknowledged by Brust to be influenced by his lifelong interest in Marxist theory and practice. Brust's parents were activists in the Workers League, the predecessor to the [[Socialist Equality Party (United States)|Socialist Equality Party]], and he continues to identify as a "[[Trotskyist]] sympathizer," linking to the SEP-affiliated [[World Socialist Web Site]] on his personal website.<ref name="SHInterview">{{Cite web |last=Olson |first=Chris |date=February 3, 2003 |title=Interview: Steven Brust |url=http://www.strangehorizons.com/2003/20030203/brust.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008045518/http://www.strangehorizons.com/2003/20030203/brust.shtml |archive-date=October 8, 2013 |access-date=December 29, 2012 |publisher=Strange Horizons }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Brust |first=Steven |date=August 30, 2012 |title=About |url=http://dreamcafe.com/about/ |website=Dream Cafe}}</ref> He endorsed the SEP's presidential candidates in the 2016 US elections.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Author Steven Brust replies to petition of writers against Trump |url=http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2016/05/30/brus-m30.html}}</ref>

==== Literary theory ====
In contrast to contemporary academic studies in literature, Brust has put forward what he called "The Cool Stuff Theory of Literature":

<blockquote>All literature consists of whatever the writer thinks is cool. The reader will like the book to the degree that he agrees with the writer about what's cool. And that works all the way from the external trappings to the level of metaphor, subtext, and the way one uses words. In other words, I happen not to think that full-plate armor and great big honking greatswords are cool. I don't like 'em. I like cloaks and rapiers. So I write stories with a lot of cloaks and rapiers in 'em, 'cause that's cool. Guys who like military hardware, who think advanced military hardware is cool, are not gonna jump all over my books, because they have other ideas about what's cool.<ref name=walton/></blockquote>

Brust elaborated, "The novel should be understood as a structure built to accommodate the greatest possible amount of cool stuff."<ref name="SHInterview" />

==== Motifs ====
The character Devera, usually a cute brown-eyed girl of about nine, appears as a [[motif (literature)|motif]] in all of Brust's novels.  In the Dragaeran books, her name is Devera. She is the (future) daughter of another character and seems to be able to appear anywhere in time and space. In Brust's non-Dragaeran books her appearances are usually brief and not always obvious.

== Musical recordings and performances ==
Brust is a singer-songwriter and drummer who has recorded a solo album, and who has played in the Minneapolis-based [[folk rock]] band [[Cats Laughing]], and with the Albany Free Traders,<ref>[http://gerisullivan.livejournal.com/84142.html "A short visual trip down musical memory lane" (Albany Free Traders publicity flyer)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211160153/http://gerisullivan.livejournal.com/84142.html |date=February 11, 2007 }}. Geri Sullivan blog.  February 1, 2007.  Retrieved December 29, 2012.</ref> and Morrigan.

Brust also co-wrote two songs on the 1994 album ''[[Antler Dance]]'' by the band [[Boiled in Lead]] (BiL), as well as many of the songs on BiL's 1995 multimedia CD ''Songs from The Gypsy''.

===Cats Laughing===
{{main|Cats Laughing}} Cats Laughing released two albums with Brust as the drummer, in 1988 and 1990. Brust also contributed as a songwriter and vocalist. The 1990 album ''Another Way to Travel'' features cover art that depicts the band members and a vehicle known as the Catmobile, the band vehicle for Cats Laughing. The car, owned by Brust, was a Cadillac ambulance, painted yellow, light blue, and dark blue, with murals.

On April 3, 2015, Brust performed as part of Cats Laughing in a reunion concert at the [[Minicon]] 50 science fiction convention in Bloomington, Minnesota.<ref name="minicon50">{{Cite web |title=Minicon 50 – The Gold Edition |url=http://mnstf.org/minicon50/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141116043417/http://mnstf.org/minicon50/ |archive-date=November 16, 2014}}</ref><ref name="beyondcons">{{Cite web |title=A Long Time Gone |url=http://beyondconventions.com/cats.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141116042213/http://beyondconventions.com/cats.html |archive-date=November 16, 2014 |access-date=November 15, 2014 |website=Beyond Conventions}}</ref> In March 2016, Cats Laughing released a double CD of their 2015 reunion, ''A Long Time Gone'', as well as a DVD by the same title with documentary concert footage.

===Solo===
{{main|A Rose for Iconoclastes}}
''[[A Rose for Iconoclastes]]'', a [[folk music|folk]] (or [[folk pop]]) album released in 1993, is Brust's only solo album.<ref name="rose-cd">{{Cite AV media |url=http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/stevenbrust |title=A Rose for Iconoclastes |last=Brust |first=Steven |type=CD |publisher=Beer & Pizza, Inc.

}} The 1995 enhanced CD ''[[Songs from The Gypsy (Boiled in Lead album)|Songs from The Gypsy]]'', by the band [[Boiled in Lead]], featured songs written by Brust and [[Adam Stemple]], as well as the full text of Brust's novel ''[[The Gypsy (novel)|The Gypsy]].''<ref name="SHInterview" />

[[AllMusic]] reviewer Steven McDonald called ''Songs from The Gypsy'' "an example of Brust's serious songwriting working well."<ref name="AM1">{{AllMusic |class=album |id=mw0000908823|label=''A Rose for Iconoclastes'' review |first=Steven |last=McDonald|access-date=April 2, 2014}}</ref>

Conversely, a critical review by [[AllMusic]]'s Roch Parisien emphasized that "''Songs from The Gypsy'' represents a failure of multimedia integration. As an audio CD, the disc serves up ten songs, ranging from acoustic trad to bluesy rockers, that ironically form a less cohesive whole than previous Boiled in Lead releases. The better numbers (like the title track) incorporate Celtic rock with Hungarian, Middle Eastern, and other interesting worldbeat influences."<ref name="AM2" /> Parisien found the album's integration with the novel unsuccessful, in that the novel's 17 chapters were presented as "scrollable text only, which also intersperse some 80 song lyric excerpts that you can play from hot buttons. Annoyingly, you must flip back to the main menu index to move from one chapter to the next."<ref name="AM2" /> Parisien concluded, "Despite Brust's engrossingly poetic, impressionist story inspired by Hungarian folk tales and revolving around three Gypsy brothers, the project does not overcome the primary limitation of bringing literature to the computer screen, that being that the computer offers an inhospitable environment for viewing literature-length text."<ref name="AM2" /> The review, written in 1995, predated a wave of popular [[e-book reader]]s that began to emerge about ten years later.

===Other performances===
Brust has performed dramatically in several [[Shockwave Radio Theater]] productions, notably ''Closing Ceremonies (aka The Fall of the House of Usherette)'' and ''PBS Liavek''.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Annotation of Shockwave Silver |url=http://www.romm.org/silver.html |access-date=July 12, 2016 |publisher=Dave Romm}}</ref>
