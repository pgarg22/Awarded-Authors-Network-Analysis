'''Jamila Gavin''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FRSL}} (born 9 August 1941) is a British writer born in [[Mussoorie]] in the [[United Provinces (1937–50)|United Provinces]] of India, in the present-day state of [[Uttarakhand]] in the [[Western Himalayas]].<!--Brit Council and walker-alex jointly--> She is known mainly for [[children's books]], including several with Indian contexts.

==Life==
Gavin was born on 9 August 1941 in Mussoorie in the foothills of the Himalayas. Her Indian father and English mother had met as teachers in [[Iran]].<ref name=egmont/> She learned to describe herself as "half and half". She says online that from her mixed background "I inherited two rich cultures which ran side by side throughout my life, and which always made me feel I belonged to both countries."

Gavin first visited England when she was six and settled there when she was 11. As an adult she worked in the music department of the [[BBC]] before becoming a writer. She wrote her first book, ''The Magic Orange Tree and Other Stories'', in 1979. After her first child was born, she became aware that there were few children's books reflecting the experience of multi-racial children. She has also written books reflecting her childhood in India, particularly her Surya trilogy.

Gavin is a patron of the [[Shakespeare Schools Festival]], a charity that allows schoolchildren across the UK to perform Shakespeare in professional theatres.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.shakespeareschools.org/about-us/patrons |title=Shakespeare Schools Foundation Patrons |website=Shakespeare Schools Foundation |publisher=[[Shakespeare Schools Foundation]] |access-date=July 12, 2021}}</ref>

Gavin settled in [[Stroud]], [[Gloucestershire]] before 1990 and was still living there in 2012.<ref name=walker-alex/> In 2016, she became one of the founders of the Stroud Book Festival,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.stroudfestival.org/word.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=8 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180506070910/http://stroudfestival.org/word.html |archive-date=6 May 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref> together with Cindy Jefferies.<ref>[[Cindy Jefferies]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=May 2017}}<ref>[http://www.gloucestershirelive.co.uk/big-interview-jamila-gavin-writer-and-director-of-stroud-s-first-ever-book-festival/story-29816176-detail/story.html]{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>

==Writer==
The Surya trilogy – ''The Wheel of Surya'' (1992), ''The Eye of the Horse'' (1994) and ''The Track of the Wind'' (1997) – is a [[family saga]] that follows two generations of Indian [[Sikh]]s and shows the impact of the [[British Empire]] and the [[Partition of India]] on their lives. All three books made [[Guardian Children's Fiction Prize]] shortlists; ''The Wheel of Surya'' was special runner-up.<!-- source is Extlink British Council -->
