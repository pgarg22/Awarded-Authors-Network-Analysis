'''Ezra Weston Loomis Pound''' (30 October 1885&nbsp;– 1 November 1972) was an [[expatriate]] American [[poet]] and [[critic]], a major figure in the early [[modernist poetry]] movement, and a [[Fascism|fascist]] collaborator in Italy during [[World War II]]. His works include ''[[Ripostes]]'' (1912), ''[[Hugh Selwyn Mauberley]]'' (1920), and his 800-page [[Epic poetry|epic poem]], ''[[The Cantos]]'' (c.&nbsp;1917–1962).<ref>Stoicheff (1995), 6; Beach (2003), 32. The first cantos were published in 1917, and the final complete canto was first published in 1962.</ref>

Pound's contribution to poetry began in the early 20th century with his role in developing [[Imagism]], a movement stressing precision and economy of language. Working in London as foreign editor of several American literary magazines, he helped discover and shape the work of contemporaries such as [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], and [[James Joyce]]. He was responsible for the 1914 serialization of Joyce's ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'', the 1915 publication of Eliot's "[[The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock]]", and the serialization from 1918 of Joyce's ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''. Hemingway wrote in 1932 that, for poets born in the late 19th or early 20th century, not to be influenced by Pound would be "like passing through a great blizzard and not feeling its cold."{{efn|name=Hemingway1932|On 21 November 1932 Hemingway wrote ("Statement on Ezra Pound", ''The Cantos of Ezra Pound: Some Testimonies'', New York: Farrar & Rinehart, 1933): "Any poet born in this century or in the last ten years of the preceding century who can honestly say that he has not been influenced by or learned greatly from the work of Ezra Pound deserves to be pitied rather than rebuked. It is as if a prose writer born in that time should not have learned from or been influenced by James Joyce or that a traveller should pass through a great blizzard and not have felt its cold or a sandstorm and not have felt the sand and the wind. The best of Pound's writing—and it is in the CANTOS—will last as long as there is any literature."<ref name="Hemingway2006pp24–25">Hemingway (2006), 24–25</ref>}}

Angered by the carnage of [[World War I]], Pound blamed the war on [[finance capitalism]], which he called "[[usury]]".<ref name=Preda2005bp90>Preda (2005b), 90</ref> He moved to Italy in 1924 and through the 1930s and 1940s promoted an economic theory known as [[social credit]], wrote for publications owned by the British fascist Sir [[Oswald Mosley]], embraced [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Italian Fascism|fascism]], and expressed support for [[Adolf Hitler]]. During World War II and the [[Holocaust in Italy]], he made hundreds of paid [[Ezra Pound's radio broadcasts, 1941–1945|radio broadcasts for the Italian government]], including in [[German-occupied Italy]], attacking the United States, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], Great Britain, international finance, munitions makers and mongers, and [[Jew]]s, among others, as causes, abettors and prolongers of the world war, as a result of which he was arrested in 1945 by American forces in Italy on charges of [[treason]]. He spent months in a U.S. military camp in [[Pisa]], including three weeks in an outdoor steel cage. Deemed unfit to stand trial, he was incarcerated in [[St. Elizabeths Hospital|St. Elizabeths]] psychiatric hospital in Washington, D.C., for over 12 years.

While in custody in Italy, Pound began work on sections of ''The Cantos'' that were published as ''[[The Pisan Cantos]]'' (1948), for which he was awarded the [[Bollingen Prize|Bollingen Prize for Poetry]] in 1949 by the [[Library of Congress]], causing enormous controversy. After a campaign by his fellow writers, he was released from St. Elizabeths in 1958 and lived in Italy until his death in 1972. His economic and political views have ensured that his life and work remain controversial.

Both sides of Pound's family emigrated from England in the 17th century. On his father's side, the immigrant ancestor was John Pound, a [[Quaker]] who arrived from England around 1650.<ref name=Moody2007pxiii/> Ezra's paternal grandmother, [[Loomis Homestead|Susan Angevine Loomis]],<ref>Wilhelm (1985a), 14; Wilhelm (1985b), 380; Kavka (1991), 145–146</ref> married Thaddeus Coleman Pound.<ref name=":0"/> On his mother's side, Pound was descended from [[William Wadsworth (patriarch)|William Wadsworth]], a [[Puritanism|Puritan]] who emigrated to [[Boston]] on the ''[[English ship Lion (1557)|Lion]]'' in 1632. Captain Joseph Wadsworth helped to write the [[Connecticut constitution]].<ref>Tytell (1987), 11</ref> The Wadsworths married into the Westons of New York; Harding Weston and Mary Parker were Pound's maternal grandparents.<ref name=Moody2007pxiii>Moody (2007), xiii</ref> After serving in the military, Harding remained unemployed, so his brother Ezra Weston and Ezra's wife, Frances Amelia Wessells Freer (Aunt Frank), helped to look after Isabel, Pound's mother.<ref>Cockram (2005), 238; for Aunt Frank's name, Wallace (2010), 205</ref>

===Early education===

Isabel Pound was unhappy in Hailey and took Ezra with her to New York in 1887 when he was 18 months old.<ref>Cockram (2005), 239; Moody (2007), 4</ref> Her husband followed and found a job as an [[Metallurgical assay|assayer]] at the [[Philadelphia Mint]].

===University===
[[File:Hilda Doolittle, 1921 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|alt=photograph|[[Hilda Doolittle]], c.&nbsp;1921]]

In 1901 Pound was admitted, aged 15, to the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s College of Liberal Arts.<ref>Moody (2007), 14; Carpenter (1988), 35</ref> Years later he said his aim was to avoid drill at the military academy.<ref>[https://archive.today/20130416003348/http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/4598/the-art-of-poetry-no-5-ezra-pound Hall (1962)]</ref> His one distinction in first year was in geometry,<ref>Carpenter (1988), 37</ref> but otherwise his grades were mostly poor, including in Latin, his major; he achieved a B in English composition and a pass in English literature.<ref>Moody (2007), 15–16</ref> In his second year he switched from the degree course to "non-degree special student status", he said "to avoid irrelevant subjects".<ref>Moody (2007), 14, 15</ref>{{efn|In "How I Began", ''[[T. P. O'Connor|T.P.'s Weekly]]'' (6 June 1913), Pound wrote: "I resolved that at thirty I would know more about poetry than any man living, that I would know the dynamic content from the shell, that I would know what was accounted poetry everywhere, what part of poetry was 'indestructible', what part could ''not be lost'' by translation and—scarcely less important—what effects were obtainable in ''one'' language only and were utterly incapable of being translated.{{pb}}"In this search I learned more or less of nine languages, I read Oriental stuff in translations, I fought every University regulation and every professor who tried to make me learn anything except this, or who bothered me with 'requirements for degrees'."<ref>Pound (1974), 24–25</ref>}} He was not elected to a [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] at Penn, but it seemed not to bother him.<ref>Carpenter (1988), 39</ref>

His parents and Aunt Frank took him on another three-month European tour in 1902, and the following year he transferred to [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] in Clinton, New York, possibly because of his grades.<ref name=Moody2007p20>Moody (2007), 20</ref> Again he was not invited to join a fraternity, but this time he had hoped to do so, according to letters home, because he wanted to live in a [[fraternity house]], and by April 1904 he regarded the move as a mistake.<ref>Carpenter (1988), 47</ref> Signed up for the Latin–Scientific course, he appears to have avoided some classes; his transcript is short of credits.<ref name=Moody2007p20/> He studied the [[Provençal dialect]] and read [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] and [[Anglo-Saxon poetry]], including ''[[Beowulf]]'' and ''[[The Seafarer (poem)|The Seafarer]]''.<ref>Moody (2007), 21, 23–24</ref>

After graduating from Hamilton in 1905 with a PhB, he returned to Penn, where he fell in love with Hilda Doolittle, then at [[Bryn Mawr College]], and hand-bound 25 of his poems for her, calling it ''Hilda's Book''. (Doolittle became a poet herself, renamed [[H.D.]] by Pound.)<ref>Doolittle (1979), 67–68; Tytell (1987), 24–27</ref> After receiving his MA in [[Romance languages]] in 1906, he registered to write a PhD thesis on the [[Gracioso|jester]]s in [[Lope de Vega]]'s plays; a two-year Harrison fellowship covered his tuition and a $500 grant, with which he sailed again to Europe.<ref>Moody (2007), 19, 28; Tytell (1987), 30; for the announcement of a fellowship to Ezra Weston Pound, see "Old Penn gives out honor list". ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'', 10 June 1906, 2</ref> He spent three weeks in Madrid in various libraries, including in the [[Royal Palace of Madrid#Royal Library|Royal Library]]. On 31 May 1906 he was standing outside the palace during the [[Morral affair|attempted assassination]] of [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|King Alfonso]] and left the city for fear of being mistaken for an anarchist.<ref>Moody (2007), 28</ref> After Spain he visited Paris and London, returning to the United States in July 1906.<ref>Moody (2007), 29</ref> His first essay, "Raphaelite Latin", was published in the ''Book News Monthly'' that September.<ref>"September Magazines".

From September 1907 Pound taught French and Spanish at [[Wabash College]],<ref>"Professor Pound goes to Wabash". ''The Indianapolis News'', 9 August 1907, 11.</ref> a [[Presbyterian]] college with 345 students in [[Crawfordsville, Indiana]],<ref>Carpenter (1988), 71–73; Moody (2007), 56</ref> which he called "the [[Inferno (Dante)#Sixth Circle (Heresy)|sixth circle of hell]]".<ref>Moody (2007), 59</ref> One former student remembered him as a breath of fresh air; another said he was "exhibitionist, egotistic, self-centered and self-indulgent".<ref>Carpenter (1988), 74</ref>

==London (1908–1914)==
===''A Lume Spento''===
Pound arrived in [[Gibraltar]] on 23 March 1908, where he earned $15 a day working as a guide for an American family there and in Spain.<ref>Carpenter (1988), 88; Moody (2007), 62</ref> After stops in Seville, Grenada, and Genoa, by the end of April he was in [[Venice]], living over a bakery near the San Vio bridge.<ref>Carpenter (1988), 89; Moody (2007), 63; for the bakery, Tytell (1987), 36</ref> In the summer he decided to self-publish his first collection of 44 poems in the 72-page ''[[A Lume Spento]]'' ("With Tapers Quenched"), 150 copies of which were printed in July 1908.<ref>Witemeyer (2005a), 185; Moody (2007), 66</ref> The title is from the third canto of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Purgatorio]]'', alluding to the death of [[Manfred, King of Sicily]].

In "Canto LXXVI" (part of ''[[The Pisan Cantos]]''), he records that he considered throwing the proofs into the [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]], abandoning the book and poetry altogether: "by the soap-smooth stone posts where San Vio / meets with il Canal Grande / between Salviati and the house that was of Don Carlos / shd/I chuck the lot into the tide-water? / [[Galley proof|le bozze]] "A Lume Spento"/ / and by the column of Todero / shd/I shift to the other side / or wait 24 hours".<ref>Pound (1947), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27537713?seq=10 65]; Pound (1996), 480; Pound (2003b), 38, lines 259–263; Terrell (1993), 398</ref>

===Move to London===
[[File:48 Langham Street, London W1.jpg|thumb|alt=photograph|48 Langham Street, [[Fitzrovia]], London W1]]
In August 1908 Pound moved to London, carrying 60 copies of ''A Lume Spento''.<ref>Baumann (1984), 357</ref> English poets such as [[Maurice Hewlett]], [[Rudyard Kipling]], and [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]] had made a particular kind of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] verse—stirring, pompous, and propagandistic—popular. According to modernist scholar James Knapp, Pound rejected the idea of poetry as "versified moral essay"; he wanted to focus on the individual experience, the concrete rather than the abstract.<ref>Knapp (1979), 25–27</ref>

Pound at first stayed in a boarding house at 8 Duchess Street, near the [[British Museum Reading Room]]; he had met the landlady during his travels in Europe in 1906.<ref>Wilhelm (1990), 3</ref> He soon moved to [[Islington]] (cheaper at [[£sd|12s 6d]] a week [[Room and board|board and lodging]]), but his father sent him £4 and he was able to move back into central London, to 48 Langham Street, near [[Great Titchfield Street]].<ref>Wilhelm (1990), 4</ref> The house sat across an alley from the Yorkshire Grey pub, which made an appearance in "Canto LXXX" (''The Pisan Cantos''), "concerning the landlady's ''doings'' / with a lodger unnamed / az waz near Gt Tichfield St. next door to the pub".<ref>Pound (2003b), 80, lines 334–336; Wilhelm (1990), 4</ref>

Pound persuaded the bookseller [[Charles Elkin Mathews|Elkin Mathews]] on [[Vigo Street]] to display ''A Lume Spento'', and in an unsigned article on 26 November 1908, Pound reviewed it himself in the ''[[Evening Standard]]'': "The unseizable magic of poetry is in this queer paper book; and words are no good in describing it."<ref>Tytell (1987), 38–39; for the ''Evening Standard'', Erkkila (2011), 3</ref> The following month he self-published a second collection, ''[[A Quinzaine for this Yule]]''.<ref>Witemeyer (2005b), 249</ref> It was his first book to have commercial success, and Elkin Matthews had another 100 copies printed.<ref name=Baumann1984p358/> In January and February 1909, after the death of [[John Churton Collins]] left a vacancy, Pound lectured for an hour a week in the evenings on "The Development of Literature in Southern Europe" at the [[University of Westminster|Regent Street Polytechnic]].<ref>Wilhelm (1990), 5–11; Baumann (1984), 360</ref>{{efn|Pound's advertised lectures were:

*18 February: "Latin Lyrists of the Renaissance".
*25 February: "Books and Their Makers during the Middle Ages".<ref>Slatin (1955), 76</ref>}} Mornings might be spent in the British Museum Reading Room, followed by lunch at the [[Vienna Café]] on [[Oxford Street]], where Pound first met [[Wyndham Lewis]] in 1910.<ref>Wilhelm (1990), 7</ref> "There were mysterious figures / that emerged from recondite recesses / and ate at the WIENER CAFÉ".<ref>Pound (2003), Canto 80, 84; Kenner (1971), 236</ref> [[Ford Madox Ford]] described Pound as "approach[ing] with the step of a dancer, making passes with a cane at an imaginary opponent":

<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;">
He would wear trousers made of green billiard cloth, a pink coat, a blue shirt, a tie hand-painted by a Japanese friend, an immense sombrero, a flaming beard cut to a point, and a single, large blue earring."<ref>Ford (1931), 370; Moody (2007), 113</ref></blockquote>

===Meeting Dorothy Shakespear, ''Personae''===
[[File:DorothyPound.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|alt=photograph|Pound married [[Dorothy Shakespear]] in 1914.]]

At a literary [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] in 1909, Pound met the novelist [[Olivia Shakespear]]<ref>Carpenter (1988), 103</ref> and later at the Shakespears' home at 12 Brunswick Gardens, Kensington, was introduced to her daughter, [[Dorothy Shakespear|Dorothy]], who became Pound's wife in 1914.<ref>Carpenter (1988), 103; Wilhelm (1990), 13–14</ref> The critic [[Iris Barry]] described her as "carrying herself delicately with the air, always, of a young Victorian lady out skating, and a profile as clear and lovely as that of a porcelain Kuan-yin".<ref>Crunden (1993), [http://books.google.com/books?id=qzC_Qehx_NAC&pg=PA272 272]</ref> "Listen to it—Ezra! Ezra!—And a third time—Ezra!", Dorothy wrote in her diary on 16 February 1909.<ref>Pound and Litz (1984), 3</ref>

Pound mixed with the cream of London's literary circle, including [[Maurice Hewlett]], [[Laurence Binyon]], [[Frederic Manning]], [[Ernest Rhys]], [[May Sinclair]], [[Ellen Terry]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Hilaire Belloc]], [[T. E. Hulme]], and [[F. S. Flint]].<ref>Tytell (1987), 42–45</ref> Through the Shakespears, he was introduced to the poet [[W. B. Yeats]], Olivia Shakespear's former lover. He had already sent Yeats a copy of ''A Lume Spento'', and Yeats had apparently found it "charming".<ref>Tytell (1987), 46</ref> Pound wrote to [[William Carlos Williams]] on 3 February 1909: "Am by way of falling into the crowd that does things here. London, deah old Lundon, is the place for poesy."<ref>Pound (1971), 7</ref> According to [[Richard Aldington]], London found Pound amusing. The newspapers interviewed him,<ref>Aldington (1941), 105.</ref> and he was mentioned in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine, which on 23 June 1909 described "Mr. Ezekiel Ton" as "the most remarkable thing in poetry since [[Robert Browning]]&nbsp;... [blending] the imagery of the unfettered West, the vocabulary of [[Wardour Street]], and the sinister abandon of Borgiac Italy".<ref>[https://archive.org/details/punchvol136a137lemouoft ''Punch'', 23 June 1909], 449; Nadel (2010), 159</ref>

[[Hilda Doolittle]] arrived in London from Philadelphia in May 1911 with the poet Frances Gregg and Gregg's mother; when they returned in September, Doolittle stayed on.

1. Direct treatment of the "thing" whether subjective or objective.

2. To use absolutely no word that does not contribute to the presentation.

</blockquote>

''Poetry'' published Pound's "A Few Don'ts by an Imagist" in March 1913. Superfluous words, particularly adjectives, should be avoided, as well as expressions like "dim lands of peace". He wrote: "It dulls the image. It mixes an abstraction with the concrete. It comes from the writer's not realizing that the natural object is always the ''adequate'' symbol." Poets should "go in fear of abstractions".<ref>[https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?volume=1&issue=6&page=29 Pound (1913)], 201</ref> He wanted Imagisme "to stand for hard light, clear edges", he wrote later to [[Amy Lowell]].<ref>Thacker (2018), 5</ref>

An example of Imagist poetry is Pound's "[[In a Station of the Metro]]", published in ''Poetry'' in April 1913 and inspired by an experience on the [[Paris Métro|Paris Underground]]. "I got out of a train at, I think, [[Concorde (Paris Métro)|La Concorde]]," he wrote in "How I began" in ''[[T. P. O'Connor|T. P.'s Weekly]]'' on 6 June 1913, "and in the jostle I saw a beautiful face, and then, turning suddenly, another and another, and then a beautiful child's face, and then another beautiful face. All that day I tried to find words for what this made me feel.&nbsp;... I could get nothing but spots of colour."

===James Joyce, Pound's unpopularity===
[[File:Revolutionary Joyce Better Contrast.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|alt=photograph|[[James Joyce]], c. 1918]]
In the summer of 1913 Pound became literary editor of ''[[The Egoist]]'', a journal founded by the [[suffragette]] [[Dora Marsden]].<ref>Monk (2005), 94</ref> At the suggestion of [[W. B. Yeats]], Pound encouraged [[James Joyce]] in December of that year to submit his work.<ref>Pound (1970), 17–18; Carpenter (1988), 224</ref> The previous month Yeats, whose eyesight was failing, had rented Stone Cottage in [[Coleman's Hatch]], Sussex, inviting Pound to accompany him as his secretary, and it was during this visit that Yeats introduced Pound to Joyce's ''[[Chamber Music (poetry collection)|Chamber Music]]'' and his "I hear an Army Charging Upon the Land".<ref name=Carpenter1988p225>Carpenter (1988), 225; Moody (2007), 240</ref> This was the first of three winters Pound and Yeats spent at Stone Cottage, including two with Dorothy after she and Ezra married in 1914.<ref>Moody (2007), 240; Longenbach (1988); also see Longenbach (1990).</ref> "Canto LXXXIII" records a visit: "so that I recalled the noise in the chimney / as it were the wind in the chimney / but was in reality [[W. B. Yeats|Uncle William]] / downstairs composing / that had made a great Peeeeacock / in the proide ov his oiye."<ref>Pound (1996), 553–554; Borstein (2001), 26</ref>{{efn|[[W. B. Yeats]], "The Peacock": "What's riches to him / That has made a great peacock / With the pride of his eye?"}}

In his reply to Pound, Joyce gave permission to use "I hear an Army" and enclosed ''[[Dubliners]]'' and the first chapter of his novel ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]''.<ref name=Carpenter1988p225/> Pound wrote to Joyce that the novel was "damn fine stuff".<ref>Pound (1970), 24</ref> [[Harriet Shaw Weaver]] accepted it for ''The Egoist'', which serialized it from 2 February 1914, despite the printers objecting to words like "fart" and "ballocks", and fearing prosecution over [[Stephen Dedalus]]'s thoughts about prostitutes. On the basis of the serialization, the publisher that had rejected ''Dubliners'' reconsidered. Joyce wrote to Yeats: "I can never thank you enough for having brought me into relation with your friend Ezra Pound who is indeed a miracle worker."<ref>Carpenter (1988), 226–227</ref>

Around this time, Pound's articles in the ''New Age'' began to make him unpopular, to the alarm of Orage.<ref>Moody (2007), 209</ref> [[Samuel Putnam]] knew Pound in Paris in the 1920s and described him as stubborn, contrary, cantankerous, bossy, touchy, and "devoid of humor"; he was "an American small-towner", in Putnam's view. His attitude caused him trouble in both London and Paris.<ref>Putnam (1947), 150, 152</ref> English women, with their "preponderantly derivative" minds, were inferior to American women who had minds of their own, he wrote in the ''New Age''. The English sense of what was right was based on respect for property, not morality. "[P]erched on the rotten shell of a crumbling empire", London had lost its energy. England's best authors—[[Joseph Conrad|Conrad]], [[William Henry Hudson|Hudson]], [[Henry James|James]], and Yeats—were not English. English writers and critics were ignorant, he wrote in 1913.<ref>Moody (2007), 209, 210–211</ref>

===Marriage===
Ezra and Dorothy were married on 20 April 1914 at [[St Mary Abbots]] in Kensington,<ref>"Marriages of the Week". ''The Times''. Issue 40502, 20 April 1914, 11.</ref> the Shakespears' parish church, despite opposition from her parents, who worried about Ezra's income. His concession to marry in church had helped. Dorothy's annual income was £50, with another £150 from her family,<ref name=Moody2007pp246-249/> and Ezra's was £200.<ref>Tytell (1987), 74</ref> Her father, Henry Hope Shakespear, had him prepare a financial statement in 1911, which showed that his main source of income was his father.<ref>Wilhelm (1990), 81</ref> After the wedding the couple moved into an apartment with no bathroom at 5 Holland Place Chambers, Kensington, next door to the newly wed H.D. and Aldington.<ref name=Moody2007pp246-249>Moody (2007), 246–249</ref> This arrangement did not last. H.D. had been alarmed to find Ezra looking for a place to live outside the apartment building the day before his wedding. Once Dorothy and Ezra had moved into the building, Ezra would arrive unannounced at H.D.'s to discuss his writing, a habit that upset her, in part because his writing touched on private aspects of their relationship. She and Aldington decided to move several miles away to [[Hampstead]].<ref>Doyle (2016), 32–33; some details in Doolittle (1979), 5; for Pound arriving at the apartment unannounced, Doyle, 332, n.&nbsp;27, cites "H.D. to Amy Lowell, 23 November 1914 (Harvard)".</ref>

===''Des Imagistes'', dispute with Amy Lowell===
[[File:Ezra Pound by Wyndham Lewis, 1919.jpeg|thumb|left|Pound by [[Wyndham Lewis]], 1919. The portrait is lost.]]

The appearance of ''[[Des Imagistes|Des Imagistes, An Anthology]]'' (1914), edited by Pound, "confirmed the importance" of ''Imagisme'', according to [[Ira Nadel]].<ref name=Nadel2001p2>Nadel (2001), 2</ref> Published in the American magazine ''[[The Glebe]]'' in February 1914 and the following month as a book, it was the first of five Imagist anthologies and the only one to contain work by Pound.<ref>Thacker (2018), 3</ref> It included ten poems by [[Richard Aldington]], seven by [[H. D.]], followed by [[F. S. Flint]], [[Skipwith Cannell]], [[Amy Lowell]], [[William Carlos Williams]], [[James Joyce]] ("I Hear an Army", not an example of Imagism), six by Pound, then [[Ford Madox Ford|Ford Madox Hueffer]] (as he was known as the time), [[Allen Upward]] and [[John Cournos]].<ref>Pound (1914), 5–6; for Joyce, see Thacker (2018), 5–6</ref>

Shortly after its publication, an advertisement for [[Wyndham Lewis]]'s new magazine, ''[[Blast (magazine)|Blast]]'' promised it would cover "Cubism, Futurism, Imagisme and all Vital Forms of Modern Art"; in the end, ''Blast'' was published only twice, in 1914 and 1915. Pound extended ''Imagisme'' to art, naming it [[Vorticism]].{{efn|Pound (1914): "The image is a radiant node or cluster&nbsp;... a VORTEX, from which, and through which, and into which, ideas are constantly rushing."<ref name=Moody2007p230>Moody (2007), 230, 256</ref> "All experience rushes into this vortex," he wrote in ''Blast'' in June 1914. "All the energized past&nbsp;... RACE, RACE-MEMORY, instinct charging the PLACID, NON-ENERGIZED FUTURE."<ref>Pound (June 1914), 153</ref>}} In June 1914 ''The Times'' announced Lewis's new Rebel Arts Centre for Vorticist art at 38 [[Great Ormond Street]].<ref>"'Vorticist' Art". ''The Times''. 13 June 1914. Issue 40549, 5.</ref>

The New England poet [[Amy Lowell]], who was to win the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]] in 1926, was apparently unhappy that only one of her poems had appeared in ''Des Imagistes''. She arrived in London in July 1914 to attend two dinners at the Dieudonné restaurant in Ryder Street, the first to celebrate the publication of ''Blast'' and the second, on 17 July, the publication of ''Des Imagistes''. At the second, Ford Madox Hueffer announced that he had been an Imagiste long before Lowell and Pound, and that he doubted their qualifications; only Aldington and H.D. could lay claim to the title, in his view. During the subsequent row, Pound left the table and returned with a tin bathtub on his head, suggesting it as a symbol of what he called ''Les Nagistes'', a school created by Lowell's poem "In a Garden", which ends with "Night, and the water, and you in your whiteness, bathing!" Apparently his behavior helped Lowell win people over to her point of view, as did her offer to fund future work.<ref>Doyle (2016), 31–32; Moody (2007), 225; for the line, Lowell (1955), 74</ref>

H.D. and Aldington were moving away from Pound's understanding of ''Imagisme'' anyway, as he aligned himself with Lewis's ideas.<ref>Aldington (1941), 139; Moody (2007), 223</ref> Lowell agreed to finance an annual anthology of ''Imagiste'' poets, but she insisted on democracy; according to Aldington, she "proposed a [[Boston Tea Party]] for Ezra" and an end to his despotic rule.<ref>Aldington (1941), 139; Thacker (2018), 6</ref> Upset at Lowell, Pound began to call ''Imagisme'' "Amygism";<ref>Moody (2007), 223</ref> he declared the movement dead and asked the group not to call themselves ''Imagistes''. Not accepting that it was Pound's invention, they refused and Anglicized the term.<ref>Moody (2007), 224; Thacker (2018), 2, 5–6</ref>

On 22 September 1914 [[T. S. Eliot]] traveled from [[Merton College, Oxford]], with an introduction from [[Conrad Aiken]], to have Pound read Eliot's unpublished "[[The Love Song of J.

Pound's ''[[Cathay (poetry collection)|Cathay]]'', published in April 1915, contains 25 examples of [[Classical Chinese poetry]] that Pound translated into English based on the notes of the [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]] [[Ernest Fenollosa]]. Fenollosa's widow, [[Sidney McCall|Mary McNeill Fenollosa]], had given Pound her husband's notes in 1913,<ref>Moody (2007), 239</ref> after Laurence Binyon introduced them.<ref>Qian (2000), 105</ref> [[Michael J.

Pound's translations from Old English, Latin, Italian, French and Chinese were highly disputed. According to Alexander, they made him more unpopular in some circles than the treason charge.<ref name=Alexander1979p62>Alexander (1979), 62</ref> [[Robert Graves]] wrote in 1955: "[Pound] knew little Latin, yet he translated Propertius; and less Greek, but he translated Alcaeus; and still less Anglo-Saxon, yet he translated ''The Seafarer''. I once asked [[Arthur Waley]] how much Chinese Pound knew; Waley shook his head despondently."<ref>Graves (1955), 138</ref>

Pound was devastated when [[Henri Gaudier-Brzeska]], from whom he had commissioned a [[:File:Hieratic Head of Ezra Pound 01 (brightened).jpg|sculpture of himself]] two years earlier, was killed in the trenches in June 1915. In response, he published ''Gaudier-Brzeska: A Memoir'' (1916), writing "A great spirit has been among us, and a great artist has gone."<ref>Pound (1916), 3; Redman (1991), 27</ref> Two months before he died, Gaudier-Brzeska had written to Pound to say that he kept ''Cathay'' in his pocket "to put courage in my fellows".<ref>Pound (1916), 76; Tytell (1987), 123</ref>

==="Three Cantos", resignation from ''Poetry''===
After the publication of ''Cathay'', Pound mentioned that he was working on a long poem. He described it in September 1915 as a "cryselephantine poem of immeasurable length which will occupy me for the next four decades unless it becomes a bore".<ref>Pound to Milton Bronner, an American reporter, cited in Moody (2007), 306.</ref> In February 1916, when Pound was 30, the poet [[Carl Sandburg]] paid tribute to him in ''Poetry'' magazine. Pound "stains darkly and touches softly", he wrote:

<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;">
All talk on modern poetry, by people who know, ends with dragging in Ezra Pound somewhere. He may be named only to be cursed as wanton and mocker, poseur, trifler and vagrant.

The point is, he will be mentioned.&nbsp;...{{pb}}In the cool and purple meantime, Pound goes ahead producing new poems having the slogan, "Guts and Efficiency," emblazoned above his daily program of work.

A suspicion arose in June 1918 that Pound himself had written an article in ''The Egoist'' praising his own work, and it was clear from the response that he had acquired enemies. The poet [[F. S. Flint]] told ''The Egoist''{{'s}} editor that "we are all tired of Mr. Pound". British literary circles were "tired of his antics" and of him "puffing and swelling himself and his friends", Flint wrote. "His work has deteriorated from book to book; his manners have become more and more offensive; and we wish he would go back to America."<ref>Crunden (1993), 271</ref>

The March 1919 issue of ''Poetry'' published Pound's ''Poems from the Propertius Series'',<ref>Pound (1919)</ref> which appeared to be a translation of the Latin poet [[Sextus Propertius]].{{efn|In his next poetry collection in 1921, Pound renamed it ''Homage to Sextus Propertius'' in response to the criticism.}} Harriet Monroe, editor of ''Poetry'', published a letter in April 1919 from a professor of Latin, [[William Gardner Hale|W. G. Hale]], who found "about three-score errors" in the text; he said Pound was "incredibly ignorant of Latin", that "much of what he makes his author say is unintelligible", and that "If Mr. Pound were a professor of Latin, there would be nothing left for him but suicide" (adding "I do not counsel this").<ref>[https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?contentId=59167 Hale (1919)], 52, 55; Kenner (1973), 286; Moody (2007), 353</ref> Pound replied to Monroe: "Cat-piss and porcupines!! The thing is no more a translation than my 'Altaforte' is a translation, or than [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Fitzgerald]]'s [[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|Omar]] is a translation."

He strove to resuscitate the dead art
Of poetry; to maintain "the sublime"
In the old sense. Wrong from the start—

No hardly, but, seeing he had been born
In a half savage country, out of date;
Bent resolutely on wringing lilies from the acorn;
[[Capaneus]]; trout for factitious bait;

By 1919 Pound felt there was no reason to stay in England. He had become "violently hostile" to England, according to [[Richard Aldington]],<ref name=":3">Aldington (1941), 217</ref> feeling he was being "frozen out of everything" except the ''New Age'',<ref>Moody (2007), 399</ref> and concluding that the British were insensitive to "mental agility in any and every form".<ref>Moody (2007), 402</ref> He had "muffed his chances of becoming literary director of London—to which he undoubtedly aspired," Aldington wrote in 1941, "by his own enormous conceit, folly, and bad manners."<ref name=":3"/>

Published by [[John Rodker]]'s The Ovid Press in June 1920,<ref>Moody (2017), 378, note 2</ref> Pound's poem ''Hugh Selwyn Mauberley'' marked his farewell to London, and by December the Pounds were subletting their apartment and preparing to move to France.<ref>Moody (2007), 387, 409</ref> Consisting of 18 short parts, ''Mauberley'' describes a poet whose life has become sterile and meaningless. It begins with a satirical analysis of the London literary scene before turning to social criticism, economics, and the war. Here the word ''[[usury]]'' first appears in his work. Just as Eliot denied he was Prufrock, Pound denied he was Mauberley.<ref>Adams (2005), 150</ref> In 1932 the critic [[F. R. Leavis]], then director of studies in English at [[Downing College, Cambridge]], called ''Mauberley'' "great poetry, at once traditional and original. Mr. Pound's standing as a poet rests on it, and rests securely".<ref>Leavis (1942), 150</ref>

On 13 January 1921 Orage wrote in the ''New Age'': "Mr. Pound has shaken the dust of London from his feet with not too emphatic a gesture of disgust, but, at least, without gratitude to this country.&nbsp;... [He] has been an exhilarating influence for culture in England; he has left his mark upon more than one of the arts, upon literature, music, poetry and sculpture; and quite a number of men and movements owe their initiation to his self-sacrificing stimulus&nbsp;..."<ref name=Orage1921/>

<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;">With all this, however, Mr. Pound, like so many others who have striven for advancement of intelligence and culture in England, has made more enemies than friends, and far more powerful enemies than friends. Much of the Press has been deliberately closed by cabal to him; his books have for some time been ignored or written down; and he himself has been compelled to live on much less than would support a navvy.

Pound's collection ''Poems 1918–1921'' was published in New York by Boni and Liveright in 1921.

Eliot wrote in 1946: "I should like to think that the manuscript, with the suppressed passages, had disappeared irrecoverably; yet, on the other hand, I should wish the blue pencilling on it to be preserved as irrefutable evidence of Pound's critical genius."<ref>[https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?volume=68&issue=6&page=34 Eliot (1946)], 330</ref> His dedication in ''The Waste Land'' was "For Ezra Pound / ''il miglior fabbro''" (the "better craftsman"), from Canto 26 of Dante's ''[[Purgatorio]]''.<ref>Bornstein (2001), 34</ref>

With the rest of his time he tries to advance the fortunes, both material and artistic, of his friends. He defends them when they are attacked, he gets them into magazines and out of jail. He loans them money. He sells their pictures. He arranges concerts for them. He writes articles about them. He introduces them to wealthy women. He gets publishers to take their books. He sits up all night with them when they claim to be dying and he witnesses their wills. He advances them hospital expenses and dissuades them from suicide.

<!--Pound published "Cantos XVII–XIX" in the winter edition of ''This Quarter'' that year.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}-->Against Hemingway's positive view of Pound, Richard Aldington told Amy Lowell that year that Pound had been almost forgotten in England: "as the rest of us go up, he goes down", he wrote.<ref>Nadel (2007), 14</ref> In the U.S., Pound won the $2,000 ''[[The Dial|Dial]]'' poetry award in 1927<ref>Marsh (2011), 103</ref> for his translation of the [[Confucian classic]] ''[[Great Learning]]''.<ref>Moody (2014), xiv</ref> Using the prize money, he launched his own literary magazine, ''The Exile'', in March, but only four issues appeared.

===Antisemitism, social credit===
{{further|Economic antisemitism}}
{{Antisemitism}}
Pound's [[antisemitism]] can be traced to at least 1910, when he wrote in ''Patria Mia'', his essays for the ''New Age'': "The Jew alone can retain his detestable qualities, despite climatic conditions." The sentence was removed from the 1950 edition.<ref name=Surrette1999p242>Surrette (1999), 242</ref> In 1922 he apparently disliked that so many Jews were contributing to ''[[The Dial]]'',<ref>Julius (1995), 182, citing Corrigan (1977), 466, and note 17, 479; Corrigan cites a letter from Pound to [[Jeanne Robert Foster]], 2 February 1922, Houghton Library, Harvard University.</ref> and in 1939, when he read his poetry at [[Harvard]], he was said to have included antisemitic poems in the program because he believed there were [[Jews]] in the audience.<ref>Tytell (1987), 268–269</ref>{{efn|In 1939, according to [[Samuel Putnam]], Pound refused to enter [[Frances Steloff]]'s [[Gotham Book Mart]] in New York because she was Jewish, even though she had helped to sell his work. Writing in 1947, Putnam said he heard this directly from Steloff.<ref>Putnam (1947), 158.</ref> According to Carpenter, this did not happen. He says that Steloff called it "an absolute falsehood".<ref>Carpenter (1988), 561</ref>}}

A friend of Pound's, the writer Lina Caico, wrote to him in March 1937 asking him to use his musical contacts to help a German-Jewish pianist in Berlin who did not have enough money to live on because of the [[Nuremberg Laws]]. Normally willing to help fellow artists, Pound replied (at length): "You hit a nice sore spot&nbsp;... Let her try Rothschild and some of the bastards who are murdering 10 million anglo saxons in England."<ref>Moody (2014), 242–243; Redman (1991), 177</ref> He nevertheless denied being an antisemite; he said he liked [[Spinoza]], [[Montaigne]], and [[Alexander del Mar]]. "What I am driving at", he wrote to [[Jackson Mac Low]], "is that some kike might manage to pin an antisem label on me IF he neglected the mass of my writing."<ref>Julius (1995), 184–185</ref>{{efn|Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library (2012): "Reading Pound's correspondence, researchers can delve in to his relationships with, and influence on, younger poets. Such is the case with Pound's letters to poet, composer, and performance artist Jackson Mac Low. In addition to discussing literature and politics, Pound defends himself from charges of anti-Semitism with the inflammatory remark that 'some kike might manage to pin an antisem lable on me IF he neglected the mass of my writing.'"<ref>[https://beinecke.library.yale.edu/article/ezra-pound-new-acquisitions "Ezra Pound–New Acquisitions"]. Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library, 7 November 2012.</ref>}}

Pound came to believe that World War I had been caused by finance capitalism, which he called "usury",<ref name=Preda2005bp90/> and that the Jews had been to blame. He believed the solution lay in [[C. H. Douglas]]'s idea of [[social credit]].<ref name=Preda2005ap87>Preda (2005a), 87</ref> Pound several times used the term ''Leihkapital'' (loan capital), equating it with Jews.<ref>Casillo (1988), 193; Feldman (2013), 52</ref> Hitler had used the same term in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' (1926).<ref>Feldman (2013), 52</ref>{{efn|''[[Mein Kampf]]'' was translated into English in full in 1939, but in 1931 [[Chatto and Windus]] published the book ''Hitler'', by Pound's friend [[Wyndham Lewis]], with translated fragments of ''Mein Kampf''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=W09KAAAAIAAJ Lewis (1931)]; Kimpel and Eaves (1983), 49; Feldman (2013), 52</ref> Lewis later turned against fascism.<ref name=Hitchens2008/>}} "Your enemy is Das Leihkapital," Pound wrote in a 1942 radio script aimed at the UK, "international, wandering Loan Capital. Your enemy is not Germany, your enemy is money on loan. And it would be better to be infected with typhus&nbsp;... than to be infected with this blindness which prevents you from understanding HOW you are undermined&nbsp;... The big Jew is so bound up with this Leihkapital that no one is able to unscramble that omelet."<ref>Doob (1978), 59</ref> The argument ran that without "usury" and Jews, there would be no class conflict.<ref>Casillo (1988), 193</ref>

In addition to presenting his economic ideas in hundreds of articles and in ''The Cantos'', Pound wrote over 1,000 letters a year throughout the 1930s.<ref name=Tytell1987p254>Tytell (1987), 254; Julius (1995), 183</ref> From 1932 he wrote 180 articles  for ''The New English Weekly'', a social-credit journal founded by A. R. Orage, and 60 for ''Il Mare'', a Rapallo newspaper.<ref>Tytell (1987), 227</ref> He wrote to [[Bill Bird]] that the press in Paris was controlled by the [[Comité des forges]]. He also came under the influence of [[Charles Maurras]], who led the far-right ''[[Action Française]]''.<ref>Tytell (1987), 228</ref> From around 1932 he began using a dating system that counted [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[March on Rome]] in October 1922 as year zero.<ref name=Wilhelm1994p70>Wilhelm (1994), 70–71</ref>

===Meeting Mussolini===

[[File:Benito Mussolini 1922.jpeg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|[[Benito Mussolini]] in 1922]]

In December 1932 Pound requested a meeting with [[Mussolini]] after being hired to work on a film script about [[Italian fascism]]. He had asked to see him before—Olga Rudge had played privately for Mussolini on 19 February 1927—but this time he was given an audience.<ref>Moody (2014), 129–130</ref> They met on 30 January 1933 at the [[Palazzo Venezia]] in Rome, the day Hitler was appointed [[Chancellor of Germany]].<ref>Moody (2014), 136–137</ref>

When Pound handed Mussolini a copy of ''A Draft of XXX Cantos'', Mussolini reportedly said of a passage Pound highlighted that it was not English. Pound said: "No, it's my idea of the way a continental Jew would speak English", to which Mussolini replied "How entertaining" (''divertente'').<ref name=Moody2014p137>Moody (2014), 137</ref> Pound also tried to discuss an 18-point draft of his economic theories.<ref name=Moody2014p137/> (Daniel Swift writes that this story has been "told and retold, and in each version, the details shift".)<ref>Swift (2017), 216</ref> Pound recorded the meeting in "Canto XLI".<ref>Pound (1996), 202; Redman (1991), 95</ref> "XI of our era"—1933, 11 years after the March on Rome—is an example of his new dating system.<ref name=Wilhelm1994p70/>

Pound wrote to C.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Douglas that he had "never met anyone who seemed to ''get'' my ideas so quickly as the boss".<ref name=Tytell1987p230>Tytell (1987), 230</ref> The meeting left him feeling that he had become a person of influence, Redman writes, someone who had been consulted by a head of state.<ref>Redman (1991), 98</ref> When he returned to Rapallo, he was greeted at the station by the town band.<ref name=Moody2014p137/>

Immediately after the meeting he began writing ''The ABC of Economics'' and ''[[Jefferson and/or Mussolini|Jefferson and/or Mussolini: L'Idea Statale Fascism as I Have Seen It]]'' (1935). The latter was ready by the end of February,<ref>Redman (2001), 101, 256; Moody (2014), 137</ref> although he had trouble finding a publisher. In 1942 he told Italy's Royal Finance Office that he had written the book for propaganda purposes in Italy's interests.<ref>Feldman (2013), 115</ref> He also wrote articles praising Mussolini and fascism for T.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Eliot's ''[[The Criterion]]'' in July 1933, the ''[[New York World Telegram]]'' in November 1933, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' on 9 April 1934,<ref>Feldman (2013), 19</ref> and in 65 articles for the ''British-Italian Bulletin'', published by the Italian Embassy in London.<ref>Feldman (2013), 53, 115</ref>

Pound's antisemitism deepened with the introduction in Italy of the [[Italian racial laws|racial laws]] in 1938,{{efn|[[Tim Redman]] (2001): "Pound's antisemitism, which had been sporadically in evidence since the publication of 'Patria Mia' in 1912, grew in virulence along with that of the Italian regime. With the passage of the racial laws in 1938, the onset of the Second World War in 1939, and the foundation of the Salo Republic, Pound's antisemitic outbursts grew in viciousness and frequency until the end of the war, when public awareness of the Holocaust forced a realization of the horrific consequences of hateful speech."<ref>Redman (2001), 258</ref>}} preceded by the publication in July that year of the [[Manifesto of Race]]. Numerous restrictions were introduced against Jews, who were required to register. Foreign Jews were stripped of their Italian citizenship, and on 18 September 1938 Mussolini declared [[Judaism]] "an irreconcilable enemy of fascism".<ref>Sarfatti (2006), 138–139</ref>

Pound arrived back in Washington, D.C. on 18 November 1945, two days before the start of the [[Nuremberg trials]].<ref>Tytell (1987), 284</ref> Lt. Col. P. V.

[[James Laughlin]] of [[New Directions Publishing|New Directions]] had Cantos LXXIV–LXXXIV, known as ''The Pisan Cantos'', ready for publication in 1946 and gave Pound an advance copy,<ref>Tytell (1987), 293</ref> but Laughlin held back, waiting for the right time to publish. A group of Pound's friends—T.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Eliot, E.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;Cummings, [[W. H. Auden]], Allen Tate, and [[Joseph Cornell]]—met Laughlin in June 1948 to discuss how to get Pound released. They planned to have him awarded the first [[Bollingen Prize]], a new national poetry award with $1,000 prize money donated by the [[Mellon family]].<ref name=Tytell302>Tytell (1987), 302</ref>

The awards committee consisted of 15 fellows of the [[Library of Congress]], including several of Pound's supporters, such as Eliot, Tate, Conrad Aiken, [[Katherine Anne Porter]], and [[Theodore Spencer]].{{efn|The Associated Press reported the list of judges as [[Conrad Aiken]], [[W.

Javits]] demanded an investigation into the awards committee. It was the last time the Library of Congress administered the prize.<ref name=Tytell303/>

===Diagnosis===
During a case conference at St. Elizabeths on 28 January 1946, six psychiatrists had concluded that Pound suffered from [[psychopathic personality disorder]] but was not [[Psychosis|psychotic]]. Present during the meeting, he decided to lie on the floor while the psychiatrists interviewed him.<ref>Torrey (1992), 202–204</ref> In 1952 the American Psychiatric Association published its first ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM-1), and St. Elizabeths began diagnosing patients according to its definitions. In July 1953 a psychiatrist added to Pound's notes that he probably suffered from [[narcissistic personality disorder]]. The main feature of Pound's personality, he wrote, was his "profound, incredible, over-weaning ''(sic)'' narcissism". A [[personality disorder]], unlike conditions that give rise to psychosis, is not regarded as a [[mental illness]], and the diagnosis would have made Pound fit to stand trial. On 31 May 1955, at the request of the hospital's superintendent Winfred Overholser, the diagnosis was changed to "psychotic disorder, undifferentiated", which is classified as mental illness.<ref>Torrey (1992), 248–249</ref> In 1966, after his release from St. Elizabeths, Pound was diagnosed with [[bipolar disorder]].<ref name=Rossi2008pp145-146/>

===Mullins and Kasper===
While in St. Elizabeths, Pound would often decline to talk to psychiatrists with names he deemed Jewish (he called psychiatrists "kikiatrists"),<ref>Cohassey (2014), 142</ref> and he apparently told [[Charles Olson]]: "I was a Zionist in Italy, but now I'm for pogroms, after what I've experienced in here (SLiz)."<ref>Olson (1991), 93</ref> He advised visitors to read the ''[[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', and he referred to any visitor he happened not to like as Jewish.<ref>Tytell (1987), 303–304</ref> In November 1953 he wrote to [[Olivia Rossetti Agresti]] that Hitler was "bit by dirty Jew mania for World Domination, as yu used to point out/ this WORST of German diseases was got from yr/ idiolized and filthy biblical bastards. Adolf clear on the baccilus of kikism/ that is on nearly all the other poisons.[sic] but failed to get a vaccine against that."<ref>Tryphonopoulous and Surette (1998), 131–132; Kimpel and Eaves (1983), 50</ref>

Pound struck up a friendship with [[Eustace Mullins]], apparently associated with the Aryan League of America and author of the 1961 biography ''This Difficult Individual, Ezra Pound''.<ref>Tytell (1987), 304; Wilhelm (1994), 286, 306</ref> Even more damaging was his friendship with [[John Kasper]], a [[Ku Klux Klan]] member who, after ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (a 1954 U.S. Supreme Court decision mandating racial desegregation in public schools), set up a [[Citizens' Council]] chapter, the Seaboard White Citizens' Council in Washington.<ref>Tytell (1987), 306; Barnhisel (1998), 283; Marsh (2015), 93</ref> Members had to be white, supportive of racial segregation, and believers in the divinity of Jesus.<ref>Marsh (2015), 135–136</ref> Kasper wrote to Pound after admiring him at university, and the two became friends.<ref name=":1">Tytell (1987), 306</ref> In 1953 Kasper opened a far-right bookstore, "Make it New", at 169 [[Bleecker Street]], [[Greenwich Village]],<ref>Swift (2017), 198</ref> that displayed Pound's work in the window.<ref>Tytell (1987), 307; Hickman (2005), 127</ref> With Pound's cooperation, he and another Pound admirer, T. David Horton, set up Square Dollar Series, a publishing imprint that reprinted Pound's books and others he approved of.<ref>Tytell (1987), 307; Barnhisel (1998), 276ff; Moody (2015), 295</ref>

It became increasingly clear that Pound was schooling Kasper in the latter's pro-segregation activism.<ref>Tytell (1987), 308</ref> In January and February 1957 the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' ran a series of articles on their relationship, after which the FBI began photographing Pound's visitors.<ref>Barnhisel (1998), 287–288; Moody (2017), 378</ref> One article alleged that some of Kasper's pamphlets had, as [[John Tytell]] put it, "a distinctly Poundian ring" to them.<ref>Tytell (1987), 306; {{cite news |last1=Bird |first1=Robert S. |title=Pound's Ideology Permeates Kasper Speeches, Writing |work=The Nashville Banner |agency=New York Herald Tribune News Service |date=31 January 1957 |page=3}}</ref>{{efn|For example, one flier was modeled on the 1914 ''[[Blast (magazine)|Blast]]'' manifesto: "JAIL [[NAACP]], alien, unclean, unchristian / BLAST irrelevant ungodly LEADERS".<ref name=":1"/>}} Kasper was jailed in 1956 over a speech he made in Clinton, Tennessee,<ref>Tytell (1987), 308; [https://www.nytimes.com/1957/06/02/archives/jail-term-upheld-for-bias-leader-kasper-foe-of-integration-loses.html "Jail term upheld for bias leader"].

They RELY ON YOUR PLAYING IT."<ref>Carpenter (1988), 829; Marsh (2015), 229</ref>

===''New Times'' articles===
Between late 1955 and early 1957,<ref>Stock (1970), 442–443</ref> Pound wrote at least 80 unsigned or pseudonymous articles—"often ugly", Swift notes—for the ''New Times'' of Melbourne, a newspaper connected to the [[Douglas Credit Party|social-credit]] movement. Noel Stock, one of Pound's correspondents and early biographers, worked for the paper and published Pound's articles there.<ref>Swift (2017), 27, 199; Stock (1970), xiii, 443</ref> A 24-year-old radio reporter at the time, Stock first wrote to Pound in hospital after reading ''The Pisan Cantos''.<ref name=Carpenter1988p815>Carpenter (1988), 815</ref>

In the ''New Times'' in April 1956, Pound wrote: "Our Victorian forebears would have been greatly scandalized at the idea that one might not be free to study inherited racial characteristics," and "Some races are retentive, mainly of the least desirable bits of their barbaric past." There was a "Jewish-Communist plot", which he compared to syphilis. Equality was dismissed as "anti-biological nonsense".<ref name=Swift2017p200/> "There were no gas ovens in Italy", he wrote in April 1956; a month later he referred to the "fuss about Hitler".<ref>Swift (2017), 218</ref> On 10 August 1956: "It is perfectly well known that the fuss about 'de-segregation' in the United States has been started by Jews." Instead, America needed "race pride".<ref name=Swift2017p200>Swift (2017), 200</ref> Using pseudonyms, he sent his articles directly to Stock, so that the newspaper's editor may not have realized they had all been written by Pound. Stock sent Pound copies of the published articles, which he would distribute to his followers.<ref>Stock (1970), 443</ref> He contributed similar material to other publications, including ''Edge'',<ref>Swift (2017), 199</ref> which Stock founded in October 1956.<ref>Stock (1970), xiii, 443</ref> Stock called ''Edge'' the magazine of the "international Poundian underground".<ref name=Carpenter1988p815/>

===Release===

Pound's friends continued to try to get him out of St. Elizabeths. In 1948, in an effort to present his radio broadcasts as harmless, Olga Rudge self-published six of them (on cultural topics only) as ''[[If This Be Treason]]''.<ref>Carpenter (1988), 786; Gill (2005), 155</ref> She visited him twice, in 1952 and 1955, but could not convince him to be more assertive about his release.<ref name=Tytell1987p305>Tytell (1987), 305</ref> In 1950 she had written to Hemingway to complain that Pound's friends had not done enough. Hemingway and Rudge did not like each other.<ref name=Cohassey2014p147>Cohassey (2014), 147</ref> He told Dorothy in 1951 that "the person who makes least sense&nbsp;...in all this is Olga Rudge".<ref>Baker (2003), 742</ref> In what John Cohassey called a "controlled, teeth-gritting response", Hemingway replied to Rudge that he would pardon Pound if he could, but that Pound had "made the rather serious mistake of being a traitor to his country, and temporarily he must lie in the bed he made". He ended by saying "To be even more blunt, I have always loved Dorothy, and still do."<ref name=Cohassey2014p147/>

Four years later, shortly after he won the [[List of Nobel laureates in Literature|Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1954, Hemingway told [[Time magazine|''Time'' magazine]] ..."I believe this would be a good year to release poets."<ref>"Books: An American Storyteller". ''Time'' magazine, 13 December 1954, [http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,935439-6,00.html 6/11]</ref> The poet [[Archibald MacLeish]] asked him in June 1957 to write a letter on Pound's behalf. Hemingway believed Pound would not stop making inappropriate statements and friendships, but he signed MacLeish's letter anyway and pledged $1,500 to be handed to Pound upon his release.<ref>Reynolds (2000), 305</ref> In an interview for the ''Paris Review'' in early 1958, Hemingway said that Pound should be released and Kasper jailed.<ref>Plimpton (1958)</ref>

Several publications began campaigning in 1957. ''[[Le Figaro]]'' published an appeal titled "The Lunatic at St Elizabeths". ''The New Republic'', ''Esquire'', and ''The Nation'' followed suit. ''The Nation'' argued that Pound was a "sick and vicious old man", but that he had rights.<ref>Tytell (1987), 322</ref> In 1958 MacLeish hired [[Thurman Arnold]], a prestigious lawyer who ended up charging no fee, to file a motion to dismiss the 1945 indictment. Overholser, the hospital's superintendent, supported the application with an affidavit stating Pound was permanently and incurably insane, and that confinement served no therapeutic purpose.<ref>Tytell (1987), 325; Lewis (1958)</ref> The motion was heard on 18 April 1958 by Chief Judge [[Bolitha Laws]], who had committed Pound to St. Elizabeths in 1945. The Justice Department did not oppose the motion,<ref>Tytell (1987), 325–326</ref> and Pound was discharged on 7 May.<ref name=Swift2017p27>Swift (2017), 27</ref>

Those close to him thought he was suffering from dementia, and in mid-1960 he spent time in a clinic when his weight dropped. He picked up again, but by early 1961 he had a urinary tract infection.

In 1966 he was admitted to the [[University of Genoa|Genoa School of Medicine]]'s psychiatric hospital for an evaluation after prostate surgery.

===Meeting Ginsberg, Reck, and Russell===
[[File:Allen Ginsberg.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=photograph|[[Allen Ginsberg]], 1978]]
In the restaurant of the Pensione Cici in Venice in 1967,<ref name=Reck1986/> Pound told [[Allen Ginsberg]], Michael Reck, and [[Peter Russell (poet)|Peter Russell]] that his poems were "a lot of double talk" and made no sense, and that his writing was "a mess", "stupid and ignorant all the way through". Reck wrote about the meeting in ''[[Evergreen Review]]'' the following year. "At seventy I realized that instead of being a lunatic, I was a moron," Pound reportedly said. He "looked very morose" and barely spoke: "There is nothing harder than conversing with Pound nowadays," Reck wrote.<ref>Reck (1968), 28–29, 84.</ref>

Pound offered a carefully worded rejection of his antisemitism, according to Reck. When Ginsberg reassured Pound that he had "shown us the way", he is said to have replied: "Any good I've done has been spoiled by bad intentions—the preoccupation with irrelevant and stupid things." Reck continued: "Then very slowly, with emphasis, surely conscious of Ginsberg's being Jewish: 'But the worst mistake I made was that stupid, suburban prejudice of anti-Semitism.'"<ref>Reck (1968), 29; Carpenter (1988), 898–899</ref>{{efn|In 1988 [[Christopher Ricks]] took issue with Pound's use of the word ''mistake'', which he wrote was "scarcely commensurate with the political and spiritual monstrosity" of Pound's antisemitism.<ref>Ricks (1988), 54</ref> [[Anthony Julius]] argued in 1995 that Pound's use of the term ''suburban'' was the result of "an arrogance that broods on the descent from an ideal of greatness rather than on the injury which that descent did to others".<ref>Julius (1995), 185.</ref>}}

===Death===
[[File:Gravesite of Ezra Pound & Olga Rudge.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|alt=photograph|left|The graves of Pound and Olga Rudge on the [[Isola di San Michele]]]]

Shortly before his death in 1972, an [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] committee, which included his publisher James Laughlin, proposed that Pound be awarded the [[Emerson-Thoreau Medal]]. After a storm of protest, the academy's council opposed it by 13 to 9.<ref>Tytell (1987), 337–338; Carpenter (1988), 908</ref> In the foreword of a Faber & Faber volume of his prose, he wrote in July: "In sentences referring to groups or races 'they' should be used with great care. re USURY: / I was out of focus, taking a symptom for a cause. / The cause is AVARICE."<ref>Carpenter (1988), 909</ref>

On his 87th birthday, on 30 October 1972, he was too weak to leave his bedroom. The next night he was admitted to the San Giovanni e Paolo Civil Hospital in Venice, where he died in his sleep on 1 November of "sudden [[intestinal blockage|blockage of the intestine]]".<ref>Carpenter (1988), 910</ref> Alerted by telegram, Dorothy Pound, who was living in a care home near Cambridge, England, requested a Protestant funeral in Venice. Telegrams were sent via American embassies in Rome and London, and the consulate in Milan, but Rudge would not change the plans she had already made for the morning of 3 November. Omar Pound flew to Venice as soon as he could, with Peter du Sautoy of Faber & Faber, but he arrived too late.<ref>Moody (2015), 487–488; Swift (2017), 244</ref> Four [[gondoliers]] dressed in black rowed Pound's body to Venice's municipal cemetery, [[Isola di San Michele]], where after a Protestant service he was buried, near [[Sergei Diaghilev|Diaghilev]] and [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]], with other non-Italian Christians.<ref>Tytell (1987), 339; Carpenter (1988), 911; Cohassey (2014), 162; [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1972/11/02/79477128.pdf "Ezra Pound Dies in Venice at Age of 87"].

After the Bollingen Prize in 1949, Pound's friends made every effort to rehabilitate him.<ref>Barnhisel (1998), 273–274; Erkkila (2011), xlvii</ref> James Laughlin's [[New Directions Publishing]] published his ''Selected Poems'', with an introduction by Eliot, and a censored selection of ''The Cantos''. [[Ralph Fletcher Seymour]] published ''Patria Mia'' (written around 1912) to show that Pound was an American patriot.<ref name=Erkila2011pxlvii/> In advertisements, magazine articles, and critical introductions, Pound's friends and publishers attributed his antisemitism and fascism to mental illness.<ref>Barnhisel (1998), 273–274</ref>

Literary scholar Betsy Erkkila writes that no one was more important to Pound's rehabilitation than [[Hugh Kenner]],<ref name=Erkkila2001pxlviii>Erkkila (2011), xlviii</ref> who was introduced to Pound by [[Marshall McLuhan]] in St. Elizabeths in May 1948, when Kenner was 25.<ref>Tremblay (1998), 110–111</ref> Kenner's ''The Poetry of Ezra Pound'' (1951) adopted a [[New Criticism|New Critical]] approach, where all that mattered was the work itself.<ref>Erkkila (2011), xliii</ref>

New Directions and [[Faber & Faber]] published ''Ezra Pound: Translations'' in 1953, introduced by Kenner, and the following year ''Literary Essays of Ezra Pound'', introduced by Eliot.<ref name=Erkila2011pxlvii>Erkkila (2011), xlvii</ref> The first PhD dissertation on Pound was completed in 1948, and by 1970 there were around ten a year.

He included in this approach Caroll F. Terrell's ''Paideuma: A Journal Devoted to Ezra Pound Scholarship'',<ref name=Surette2005>Surette and Tryphonopoulos (2005)</ref> founded in 1972 and edited by Kenner and [[Eva Hesse]],<ref name=Erkkila2001pxlviii/>{{efn|From 2001 ''Paideuma'' began publishing material about modernist poetry in general, not only Pound.<ref>Erkkila (2011), lvi–lvii</ref>}} and Terrell's two-volume ''A Companion to the Cantos of Ezra Pound'' (1980–1984).<ref name=Surette2005/> In 1971 Terrell founded the [[National Poetry Foundation]] to focus on Pound, and organized conferences on Pound in 1975, 1980, 1985, and 1990.<ref name=Terrellobit>[https://obituaries.bowdoin.edu/carroll-franklin-terrell-38/ "Carroll Franklin Terrell '38"]. ''Bowdowin'' magazine, undated.</ref>

Following [[Eustace Mullins]]' biography, ''This Difficult Individual, Ezra Pound'' (1961), was ''Life of Ezra Pound'' (1970) by Noel Stock. A former reporter, Stock was one of the publishers of Pound's newspaper articles in the 1950s, including his antisemitism.<ref>Nadel (2010), 162; Swift (2017), 199</ref> Ronald Bush's ''The Genesis of Ezra Pound's Cantos'' (1976) became the first critical study of ''The Cantos''.<ref name=Nadel2001p12>Nadel (2001), 12</ref> Several significant biographies appeared in the 1980s: J. J. Wilhelm's three-volume work (1985–1994), beginning with ''The American Roots of Ezra Pound''; [[John Tytell]]'s ''Ezra Pound: The Solitary Volcano'' (1987); and [[Humphrey Carpenter]]'s 1005-page ''A Serious Character'' (1988). A. David Moody's three-volume ''Ezra Pound: Poet'' (2007–2015) combines biography with literary criticism.<ref name=Nadel2010bp162>Nadel (2010), 162–165</ref>

Studies that examine Pound's relationships with the [[Far-right politics|far right]] include Robert Casillo's ''The Genealogy of Demons'' (1988); [[Tim Redman]]'s ''Ezra Pound and Italian Fascism'' (1999); Leon Surette's ''Pound in Purgatory'' (1999);<ref>Coats (2009), 81</ref> [[Matthew Feldman (historian)|Matthew Feldman]]'s ''Ezra Pound's Fascist Propaganda, 1935–45'' (2013); and Alec Marsh's ''John Kasper and Ezra Pound'' (2015).

 |source= — Closing lines of ''[[The Cantos]]''<ref name=Pound1996p817/>}}
Much of Pound's legacy lies in his advancement of some of the best-known modernist writers of the early 20th century, particularly between 1910 and 1925.<ref name=Menand2008>[https://archive.today/20141003035358/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/06/09/the-pound-error Menand (2008)]; [https://archive.today/20190903045718/https://www.nytimes.com/1972/11/02/archives/ezra-pound-a-man-of-contradictions.html Montgomery (1972)]</ref> In addition to Eliot, Joyce, Lewis, Frost, Williams, Hemingway, H.D., Aldington, and Aiken, he befriended and helped Cummings, Bunting, Ford, [[Marianne Moore]], [[Louis Zukofsky]], [[Jacob Epstein]], [[Margaret C. Anderson|Margaret Anderson]], [[George Oppen]], and [[Charles Olson]].<ref>Bornstein (2001), 22–23; [https://archive.today/20141003035358/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/06/09/the-pound-error Menand (2008)]</ref>

[[File:Hieratic Head of Ezra Pound 01 (brightened).jpg|thumb|upright|Ezra Pound in marble by [[Henri Gaudier-Brzeska]] (1914)]]

Beyond this, his legacy is mixed. He was a strong lyricist with an "ear" for words;<ref>Ingham (2001), 236–237</ref> his ''Times'' obituary said he had a "faultless sense of [[cadence]]".<ref name=LondonTimesobit/> According to [[Ira Nadel]], he "overturned poetic meter, literary style, and the state of the long poem". Nadel cited the importance of Pound's editing of ''The Waste Land'', the publication of ''Ulysses'', and his role in developing of Imagism.<ref name=Nadel2005pix>Nadel (2005), ix</ref> Hugh Witemeyer argued that Imagism was "probably the most important single movement" in 20th-century English-language poetry, because it affected all the leading poets of Pound's generation and the two generations after him.<ref>Witemeyer (2001), 48</ref> According to [[Hugh Kenner]] in 1951, although no great contemporary writer was less read than Pound, there was no one who could "over and over again appeal more surely, through sheer beauty of language" to people who would otherwise rather talk about poets than read them.<ref>Kenner (1951), 16</ref>

Against this, [[Robert Conquest]] argued in 1979 that critics were responsible for having promoted Pound despite his "minimal talent", which was "grossly exaggerated".<ref>Conquest (1979), 236</ref> "This is an accusation less against the fantastic arrogance of Pound", he wrote, "than against the narrow-minded obscurantism of the departments of English and the critical establishment who have set up a system of apologetics which the slyest Jesuit of the seventeenth century would have baulked at."<ref>Conquest (1979), 243</ref> According to [[Samuel Putnam]], those who respected Pound's poetry were less likely to respect his prose or work as a critic.<ref>Putnam (1947), 141</ref>

The outrage over his collaboration with the [[Axis powers]] was so deep that it dominated the discussion. "A greater calamity cannot befall the art", [[Arthur Miller]] wrote in December 1945, "than that Ezra Pound, the Mussolini mouthpiece, should be welcomed back as an arbiter of American letters&nbsp;..."<ref>Bigsby (2009), 252</ref> Over the decades, according to Redman, critics argued that Pound was not really a poet or not really a fascist, or that he was a fascist but his poetry is not fascistic, or that there was an evil Pound and a good Pound.<ref>Redman (1991), 2–3</ref> The American poet [[Elizabeth Bishop]], 1956 [[Pulitzer Prize in Poetry|Pulitzer Prize]] winner and one of his hospital visitors—Pound called her "Liz Bish"—reflected the ambivalence in her poem "[[Visits to St. Elizabeths]]" (1957).<ref>Moody (2015), 251; Swift (2017), 14–15</ref> "This is the time / of the tragic man / that lies in the house of Bedlam." As the poem progresses, the tragic man, never named, becomes the talkative man; the honored man; the old, brave man; the cranky man; the cruel man; the busy man; the tedious man; the poet, the man; and, finally, the wretched man.<ref>[https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/53008/visits-to-st-elizabeths Bishop (1957)]</ref>
