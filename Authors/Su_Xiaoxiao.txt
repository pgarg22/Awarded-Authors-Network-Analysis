'''Su Xiaoxiao''' ({{zh|c=|s=|t=蘇小小}}) (c.479{{sfn|Berg|2013|p=143}} – c.501),<ref name="tomb">Death year based on year of entombment: [http://www.sidestep.com/travel-guides/text/asia/china/shanghai?destId=FR717&narrativeId=FR0717033879 Exploring Hangzou], Solitary Island</ref> also known as Su Xiaojun and sometimes by the appellation "Little Su", was a famous [[China|Chinese]] [[yiji|courtesan]] and [[List of Chinese language poets|poet]] from Qiantang City (now [[Hangzhou]], [[Zhejiang|Zhejiang Province]]) in the [[Southern Qi Dynasty]].{{sfn|Berg|2013|p=143}} She had a sister named Su Pannu.{{sfn|Barnstone|Ping|2010|p=84}}

== Life and career ==
Well known for her intellectual talent and great beauty, Su Xiaoxiao pursued the values of love, beauty and humanity, as reflected in her writing and in popular stories. There are many stories attached to the life of Su Xiaoxiao, with no way of knowing the historical accuracy of any single story.  One such story has her meeting a young scholar travelling in a state of dire poverty, hoping to reach the capital to sit the official examinations. She gave the scholar several nuggets of silver from her purse, but sadly he never returned to her after completing the examinations.  In any event, it seems that she did not wish to be a man's wife or mistress, preferring to share her beauty with the common people while showing a certain contempt for the wealthy.

In her late teens, Su Xiaoxiao developed a terminal illness, during which she took the view that heaven was giving her the special opportunity to leave a legacy of beauty in her memory through her death at a young age. She died at a mere 19 years of age.{{sfn|Berg|2013|p=143}} For more than a thousand years, her tomb was situated at the Xilin Bridge beside her beloved [[West Lake]].

Su Xiaoxiao's life and poetry provided much inspiration for later Chinese writers and artists. She was the romantic heroine of [[Tang dynasty]] poets [[Bai Juyi]], [[Li He]], [[Wen Tingyun]], and [[Ming dynasty]] writer [[Zhang Dai]], also the heroine of the story "Romantic Trails of Xilin" in ''Fine Stories of the West Lake''.{{sfn|Berg|2013|pp=143-146}} A woodcut of unknown provenance was used to illustrate porcelain objects<ref>{{cite web |title=Figure 6 |url=http://www.georgiasouthern.edu/~batchelo/figure6.htm |publisher=[[Georgia Southern University]] |access-date=15 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312085949/http://www.georgiasouthern.edu/~batchelo/figure6.htm |archive-date=12 March 2007}}</ref> during the [[Ming dynasty]] and early [[Qing dynasty]]. The woodcut was based on the short story "Dreaming of Qiantang", which told of the scholar Sima Yu, who, while visiting Hangzhou, wrote a poem about a dream he had in which Su Xiaoxiao was brought by three gusts of wind to come and sing at his window. Su was also a frequent figure for portrayal in Chinese theater.

Su Xiaoxiao's tomb was destroyed during the [[Cultural Revolution]], but it was rebuilt in 2004, complete with a brand new pavilion decorated with twelve poetry posts handwritten by famous calligraphers. The current tomb is empty.<ref>{{Cite web|last=网易|date=2021-05-29|title=杭州西湖苏小小墓里，真的埋着绝代佳人苏小小吗？|url=https://www.163.com/dy/article/GB49TTGQ05238DGE.html|access-date=2021-11-10|website=www.163.com}}</ref> Su Xiaoxiao's tomb is now again a major tourist site in Hangzhou. Since the pavilion the tomb is hosted under is named Mucaiting, which could be misread phonetically as Mocaiting (touch for wealth), many tourist walk by would purposefully touch or throw coins on the tomb for hope of wealth and prosperity.<ref>{{Cite web|title=慕才亭成了“摸财亭”(图)_新闻中心_新浪网|url=http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2004-10-04/17253834237s.shtml|access-date=2021-11-10|website=news.sina.com.cn}}</ref> Su Xiaoxiao is also the heroine of TV series ''Loving Courtesan Su Xiaoxiao''.
