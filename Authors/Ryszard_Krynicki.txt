'''Ryszard Krynicki''' (born 28 June 1943) is a [[Poles|Polish]] [[poet]] and [[translator]], member of the Polish "New Wave" Movement. He is regarded as one of the most prominent [[post-war]] [[contemporary literature|contemporary]] [[List of Polish-language poets|Polish poets]]. In 2015, he was awarded the [[Zbigniew Herbert International Literary Award]] as a recognition for his poetry works.

== Life and works ==
He was born on 28 June 1943 in [[St. Valentin]], [[Austria]]. After [[World War II]], he moved to Poland, where he graduated from [[Marie Curie]] High School No. 2 in [[Gorzów Wielkopolski]]. He further studied [[Polish philology]] at the [[Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań|Adam Mickiewicz University]] in [[Poznań]].  He made his literary debut in 1964 in Poznań's literary club ''Od nowa'', where he publicly read out one of his untitled poems. His first poem was published in 1966 (''Wczasowstąpienie'') in a literary magazine ''Pomorze''. In 1968, he wrote ''Pęd pogoni, pęd ucieczki'' ("The Impulse to Pursue, the Impulse to Flee"), which one year later appeared in his first book of poetry ''Akt urodzenia'' ("The Birth Certificate"). He also published articles in an emigration [[Weekly newspaper|weekly]] ''Wiadomości'' ("The News").<ref>{{cite news|url=https://teatrnn.pl/leksykon/artykuly/ryszard-krynicki-ur-1943/ |title=Ryszard Krynicki (ur. 1943) |access-date=2017-11-25}}</ref>

In the 1970s and 1980s, he was actively involved in the opposition movement against communist authorities of the [[Polish People's Republic]]. In 1971–1973 he worked at the editorial office of the [[Kraków]]-based ''Student'' magazine where he met many prominent members of the generation of the Polish ''New Wave'' (1968–1976) including [[Adam Zagajewski]] and [[Stanisław Barańczak]]. He was the signatory of [[Letter of 59]], which was a reaction of Polish [[intellectual]]s against the undemocratic changes in the [[Constitution of the Polish People's Republic]]. As a direct consequence of this, his works were officially banned between 1976–1980. He collaborated with [[Workers' Defense Committee]] and in the period of 1977–1981, he published articles in ''Zapis'' magazine. In 1980, he took part in a [[hunger strike]] in [[St. Christopher]]'s Church in [[Podkowa Leśna]] as an act of solidarity with the detained [[political dissident]]s Dariusz Kobzdej and [[Mirosław Chojecki]]. He published numerous texts and articles in opposition magazines such as ''Solidarności Wielkopolski'' ("Greater Poland Solidarity"), ''Obserwator Wielkopolski'' ("Greater Poland's Observer") and ''Bez Debitu'' ("Without Debit"). He also published his works in ''Zeszyty Literackie'' ("Literary Notebooks"). In 1988, he co-founded ''wydawnictwo a5'' [[publishing house]] in [[Poznań]], which specialized in the publication of poetry books. Since 1991, he has been running a publishing company together with his wife Krystyna. Nowadays, Krynicki is seen as one of the foremost representatives of contemporary Polish poetry alongside [[Adam Zagajewski]] and [[Ewa Lipska]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wordswithoutborders.org/contributor/ryszard-krynicki |title=Ryszard Krynicki Words Without Borders |access-date=2017-11-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bookinstitute.pl/autorzy-detal,literatura-polska,3076,krynicki-ryszard.html |title=Ryszard Krynicki |access-date=2017-11-25}}</ref> In 2015, he became a member of the [[Polish Academy of Learning]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://pau.krakow.pl/Rocznik_PAU/2015_2016/Rocznik_2015_2016.pdf |title=ROCZNIK POLSKIEJ AKADEMII UMIEJĘTNOŚCI ROK 2015/2016 |access-date=2017-11-25}}</ref>

== Themes ==
His early poems contain a wealth of [[rhetoric device|poetic devices]] and evoke gloomy imagery which presents reality as "a nightmare of chaos, emptiness and nothingness". The all-pervasive feeling of oppression and hostility characteristic of his works in this period can be interpreted in political, ethical and metaphysical aspects. Krynicki's approach to poetry at that time "concentrated on language in order to discern the falsehoods perpetrated in language by the [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] ideology. The goal was to escape from the lies of communist new-speak". His later works represent a radical shift from complex, Baroque poems to short, simple, miniature poems that evolved from "an imperative of internal self-perfection, cleansing the world of falsehood, and refusing to submit to various concepts of nothingness". Their aim was to inspire the reader to contemplate the world and to encourage empathy.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://culture.pl/en/artist/ryszard-krynicki |title=Ryszard Krynicki |access-date=2017-11-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bookinstitute.pl/autorzy-detal,literatura-polska,3076,krynicki-ryszard.html|title=Ryszard Krynicki |access-date=2017-11-25}}</ref>
