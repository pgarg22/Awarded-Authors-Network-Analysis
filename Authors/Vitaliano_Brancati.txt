==Biography==
Born in [[Pachino]], [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]],  Brancati studied in [[University of Catania|Catania]], where he graduated in letters and where he spent the most part of his life.<ref name=bio>{{cite news|last1=Alberto Rossi|title=La morte di Vitaliano Brancati|issue=230|newspaper=[[La Stampa]]|date=1954-09-26|page=3}}</ref> While he started writing at young age and at 25 years old he was already the author of six books, which were largely influenced by [[Italian Fascism|fascist ideals]] and which were later rejected by the same Brancati, critics tend to set the starting point of his career in 1935, when he released the collection of short stories ''In search of a cause''.<ref name="bio"/> Brancati got his first and probably major success in 1941, with the novel ''[[Don Giovanni in Sicilia (novel)|Don Giovanni in Sicilia]]'', a vibrant and humorous portrait of the Sicilian temperament.<ref name="bio"/>

In 1944 he wrote the novel ''Gli anni perduti'' ("The Lost Years"), a bold satire of [[Benito Mussolini]]'s megalomania, and in 1946 ''Vecchio con gli stivali'' ("Old Man in Boots"), a satirical short story inspired by the vicissitudes of the Italian fascism which won the Vendemmia Award and which was adapted into a successful film, ''[[Difficult Years]]'' by [[Luigi Zampa]].<ref name="bio"/> In 1950 he won the [[Bagutta Prize]] with one another well-known novel, ''Il bell'Antonio'' ("The Handsome Antonio").<ref name="bio"/>
