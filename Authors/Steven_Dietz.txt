People Really Like Hitchcock? |work=The L Magazine|date=September 21, 2010 }}</ref>  Dietz's plays have been produced internationally in over twenty countries, and translated into a dozen languages.

His work as a director has been seen Off-Broadway (Westside Arts), at major regional theaters (Actor's Theatre of Louisville, Seattle Repertory Theatre, ACT Theatre - Seattle, Northlight Theatre - Chicago, Denver Center Theatre Company), as well as at the Sundance Institute and the Playwrights' Center - Minneapolis.  Dietz taught in the MFA Playwriting and Directing programs at the University of Texas at Austin from 2006-2018,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.americantheatre.org/2018/07/24/steven-dietz-to-leave-full-time-faculty-position-at-ut-austin/|title=Steven Dietz to Leave Full-Time Faculty Position at UT Austin|first=American Theatre|last=Editors|date=July 24, 2018|website=AMERICAN THEATRE|accessdate=December 27, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://theatredance.utexas.edu/people/dietz-steven|title=Steven Dietz &#124; Department of Theatre and Dance - The University of Texas at Austin|website=College of Fine Arts - University of Texas at Austin|accessdate=June 18, 2019}}</ref> and continues to conduct master classes in playwriting, story-making and collaboration around the United States.  He also teaches nationally as a Dramatists' Guild "Traveling Master."

==Life and career==
Born and raised in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], Dietz graduated in 1980 with a B.A. in Theatre Arts from the [[University of Northern Colorado]],<ref>Michael Kuchwara. "Dietz's Plays Pop Up Everywhere, but Only Occasionally on Broadway." (Baton Rouge LA) The Advocate, September 5, 2004, p. M9.</ref> after which he moved to [[Minneapolis]] and began his career as a director of new plays at [[The Playwrights' Center]] and other local theaters.  During these years he also formed a small theatre company (Quicksilver Stage) and began to write plays of his own.  A commission from [[ACT Theatre]] to write "God's Country" brought him to [[Seattle, Washington]] in 1988, and he lived and worked in Seattle from 1991 to 2006.  In 2006 he accepted a professorship at the [[University of Texas at Austin]].  Since 2006, he and his family have divided their time between Austin and Seattle.

He is the recipient of the [[International PEN|PEN]] U.S.A. Award in Drama (for [[Lonely Planet (play)|Lonely Planet]], perhaps his most widely performed work);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theaterjones.com/ntx/reviews/20190206154636/2019-02-07/Amphibian-Stage-Productions/Lonely-Planet|title=Review: Lonely Planet &#124; Amphibian Stage Productions|first=Jan|last=Farrington|date=February 7, 2019|website=TheaterJones.com|accessdate=June 18, 2019}}</ref> the Kennedy Center Fund for New American Plays Award (''Fiction'' and ''Still Life With Iris''); the Lila Wallace/[[Reader's Digest]] Award (''The Rememberer''); the [[Yomiuri Shimbun]] Award for his adaptation of [[Shusaku Endo]]'s Silence; and the 2007 [[Edgar Allan Poe Award]] for Best Mystery for his adaptation of [[William Gillette]]'s and [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s 1899 play ''Sherlock Holmes: The Final Adventure''.   Dietz is also a two-time finalist for the prestigious Steinberg New Play Award (for "Last of the Boys" and "Becky's New Car"), given by the American Theatre Critics Association.  He was awarded the 2016 Steinberg New Play Award Citation for "Bloomsday."

Dietz's plays range from the political ("Last of the Boys", "God's Country", "Halcyon Days", "Lonely Planet") to the comedic ("Becky's New Car", "More Fun than Bowling", "Over the Moon"). Many of them, (e.g. "Trust", "Private Eyes", "Fiction", "Rancho Mirage") have as a central theme the effects of personal betrayal and deception.  A recent obsession of Dietz's seems to be the return of the "thriller" to the contemporary theatre canon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://catf.org/on-clover-road-by-steven-dietz/|title=On Clover Road by Steven Dietz|accessdate=December 27, 2019}}</ref> Examples include the conspiracy thriller, "Yankee Tavern";  the classic single-set thriller, "On Clover Road";  the intimate thriller, "The Shimmering";   and the psychological thriller, "How a Boy Falls."  The majority of the plays are published (in acting editions) by either Dramatists Play Service (New York), or Samuel French, Inc., (New York).  An anthology of Dietz's work for young audiences was published by UT Press in 2015.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://utpress.utexas.edu/books/jennings-steven-dietz|title=Steven Dietz Four Plays for Family Audiences Plays by Steven Dietz; edited by Coleman A. Jennings, including comments by Linda Hartzell and Susan Mickey, foreword by Kim Peter Kovac|date=February 22, 2015|accessdate=June 18, 2019|via=utpress.utexas.edu}}</ref>  Many of the short plays are also anthologized.

Dietz's work as a director has been seen at many of America's leading regional theatres. He has directed premiere productions of new plays at [[Actors Theatre of Louisville]]'s [[Humana Festival]], [[Seattle Repertory Theatre]], Denver Center Theatre Company, Northlight Theatre (Chicago), [[ACT Theatre]] (Seattle), [[San Jose Repertory Theatre]], [[City Theatre (Pittsburgh)|City Theatre]] (Pittsburgh), Westside Arts (Off-Broadway), and the [[Sundance Institute]], among many others. He was a resident director for ten years at the Playwrights' Center in Minneapolis, where he also served as Artistic Director of Midwest PlayLabs.

Dietz's articles on new play development—most first seen in American Theatre Magazine<ref>(1) "Doom Eager: Writing What We Need to Know", (2) "Developed to Death", (3) "An Audience Manifesto" American Theatre9.n9(Jan 1993):9(1).Expanded , and (4) "A Modest Proposal: On Training Directors for the New Century."
