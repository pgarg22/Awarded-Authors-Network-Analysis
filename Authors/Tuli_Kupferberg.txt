==Biography==
Naphtali Kupferberg was born into a [[Judaism|Jewish]], [[Yiddish Language|Yiddish-speaking]] household in New York City.<ref>Vox Table Podcast, Fed. 22, 2010. [http://www.tabletmag.com/podcasts/26071/fugging-around/ Fugging Around - by Vox Tablet > Tablet Magazine - A New Read on Jewish Life]</ref> A ''[[cum laude]]'' graduate of [[Brooklyn College]] in 1944, Kupferberg founded the magazine ''Birth'' in 1958.<ref>{{cite news |first=Ben |last=Sisario |title=Rock 'n' Roll Dissidents, Fearless for 4 Decades |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03E6DE173CF936A25754C0A9659C8B63 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=2003-07-15 |access-date=2007-10-08 }}</ref>

Kupferberg reportedly appears in Ginsberg's poem ''[[Howl]]'' as the person "who jumped off the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] and walked away unknown and forgotten into the ghostly daze of [[Chinatown]] soup alleyways & firetrucks, not even one free beer." The incident in question actually occurred on the [[Manhattan Bridge]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Stephen |last=Holden |title=POP/JAZZ; The Fugs Look Back to 1967's 'Summer of Love' |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DE153FF932A1575BC0A961948260  |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=1987-08-21 |access-date=2007-10-08 |quote=. . . Tuli Kupferberg, the poet and cartoonist whom Mr. Ginsberg remembered in ''Howl'' as the person who jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge and survived. (Mr. Ginsberg said the other day that the incident actually took place on the Manhattan Bridge in 1945.) }}</ref> [[Allen Ginsberg|Ginsberg]]'s description in ''Howl'' uses [[poetic license]]. Kupferberg did jump from the Manhattan Bridge in 1944, after which he was picked up by a passing tugboat and taken to [[Gouverneur Health|Gouverneur Hospital]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://forward.com/schmooze/129369/what-the-hell-was-that-remembering-tuli-kupferbe/|title='What The Hell Was That?': Remembering Tuli Kupferberg|website=The Forward|access-date=24 September 2021}}</ref> Severely injured, he had broken the  [[transverse process]] of his spine and spent time in a body cast.<ref>''Mojo'', October 2010, Michael Simmons, Tuli Kupferberg featured obit.</ref>

In 1964, Kupferberg formed the satirical rock group [[the Fugs]] with poet [[Ed Sanders]].<ref>{{cite news |first=John |last=Strausbaugh |title=The Old Fug |url=http://www.nypress.com/print.cfm?content_id=2721&author_id=2 |work=New York Press |date=2000-09-20 |access-date=2007-10-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070611174453/http://www.nypress.com/print.cfm?content_id=2721&author_id=2 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-11}}</ref>

An anti-police-brutality skit from his Revolting Theatre appeared in the 1971 [[Richard Pryor]] underground film ''[[Dynamite Chicken]]''. In 1972, Kupferberg played the role of [[God]] in the Canadian experimental film ''[[Voulez-vous coucher avec God?]]''.

Kupferberg suffered a stroke in April 2009 at his home in New York City, which left him severely visually impaired and in need of regular nursing care. After treatment for a number of days at a New York hospital, followed by convalescence at a nursing home, he recuperated at home.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://exclaim.ca/music/article/fugs_founder_tuli_kupferberg_dies_at_86 |title=Fugs Founder Tuli Kupferberg Dies at 86|website=Exclaim.ca |access-date=2017-01-13 |date=2010-07-12 }}</ref>
