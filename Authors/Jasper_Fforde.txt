He is known mainly for his ''[[Thursday Next]]'' novels, but has published two books in the loosely connected ''[[The Big Over Easy|Nursery Crime]]'' series and the first books of two other independent series: ''[[The Last Dragonslayer]]'' and ''[[Shades of Grey 1: The Road to High Saffron|Shades of Grey]]''. Fforde's books abound in literary [[allusions]] and wordplay, tightly scripted plots and playfulness with the conventional, traditional genres. They usually contain elements of [[metafiction]], [[parody]], and [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]].

Fforde was born in London on 11 January 1961, the son of [[John Standish Fforde]], the [[Chief Cashier#Chief Cashiers of The Bank of England|24th Chief Cashier]] for the [[Bank of England]].<ref name=PW>{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/authors/interviews/article/54325-q-a-with-jasper-fforde.html |title=Q & A with Jasper Fforde |first=Sue |last=Corbett |date=11 October 2012 |magazine=[[Publishers Weekly]] |access-date=26 June 2020 |archive-date=26 June 2020 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200626212339/https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/authors/interviews/article/54325-q-a-with-jasper-fforde.html |url-status=live}}</ref> He is a grandson of a Polish political adviser, [[Joseph Retinger]], and a great-grandson of the journalist [[E.
