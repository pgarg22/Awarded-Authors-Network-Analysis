'''Ahmet Haşim''' (also written as '''Ahmed Hâşim'''; <span dir="ltr">1884?&nbsp;– 4 June 1933) was an influential [[Turkish people|Turkish]] poet of the early 20th century.

==Biography==
Ahmed Hâşim was born in [[Baghdad]], probably in the year 1884. His father was the provincial governor of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[sanjak]] of Fizan. Around 1893, Ahmed went to [[Istanbul]] with his father, following the death of his mother. In 1906, having graduated from the ''Mekteb-i Sultanî'' (now [[Galatasaray High School]]), he began work in the ''Reji'', the state tobacco monopoly, and was registered at [[Istanbul University]]'s school of law. Between 1908 and 1910, Hâşim worked as a French language teacher in the city of [[İzmir]] and as an officer in the Office of Public Debts (''Düyun-u Umumiye''). He was [[Conscription|conscripted]] in the [[World War I|First World War]], serving mostly in [[Anatolia]]; following the war, he returned to Istanbul and worked in the [[Türkiye Cumhuriyeti Merkez Bankası|Ottoman Bank]]. After the foundation of the [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]], Hâşim worked as a teacher of aesthetics in the Academy of Fine Arts and as a French language teacher at Istanbul University. For many years, he also wrote [[essay]]s for the newspapers ''[[Akşam]]'' and ''[[İkdam]]''.

Ahmed Hâşim died on 4 June 1933, and was laid to rest at the [[Eyüp Cemetery]].

==Works==
Ahmed Hâşim's first poems were published in ''Mecmua-i Edebiye'' (مجموعه ادبيه; "Literary Periodical") between 1900 and 1912. At this time, he was a member of the movement known as ''[[Turkish literature#The Dawn of the Future movement|Fecr-i Âtî]]'' (ﻓﺠﺮ ﺁﺕﯽ), or "Dawn of the Future". Later, he would publish together with other poets in the periodical ''Dergâh'' (درگاه). In 1921, at around this time, he published his first book of poetry, ''Göl Saatleri'' (گول ساعتلرى; "''Hours of the Lake''"). His second book of poetry, ''Piyâle'' (پياله; "''The Wine Cup''"), would follow in 1926.

Hâşim's early poetry was very much in the [[Parnassian poets|Parnassian]] and [[Decadence|Decadent]] vein of the poets Tevfik Fikret (1867–1915) and Cenab Şahâbeddin (1870–1934), early influences who were a part of the ''[[Turkish literature#The "New Literature" movement|Edebiyyât-ı Cedîde]]'' (ادبيات جدیده; "New Literature") movement. Hâşim's later poetry, however—collected in ''Göl Saatleri'' and ''Piyâle''—evidences more of a [[Symbolism (arts)|French Symbolist]] influence, particularly that of [[Henri de Régnier]], whom Hâşim greatly admired. This late poetry can—to a certain extent—be seen to adhere to the ''Fecr-i Âtî'' movement's variation of the [[Art for art's sake|Symbolist motto]]: "''Sanat şahsî ve muhteremdir''" (صنعت ﺵﺨﺼﯽ و محترمدر; "Art is personal and revered"). In line with this motto, and with the Symbolist movement in general, much of his poetry was more indirect than direct, using thick imagery so as to create a strong sensory impression, as in the opening lines of his famous poem from the book ''Piyâle'', "Merdiven" ("Stairway"):

:آغير، آغير چيقه جقسْك بو مرديونلردن
:أتکلرکده کونش رنکى بر ييغين ياپراق
:..و بر زمان باقاجقسك سمايه آغلايه رق

:،صولر صاراردى ... يوزك پرده پرد صولقده
:..قزيل هوالرى سيرايت که آقشام اولقده

:''Ağır, ağır çıkacaksın bu merdivenlerden,''
:''Eteklerinde güneş rengi bir yığın yaprak,''
:''Ve bir zaman bakacaksın semâya ağlayarak..''

:''Sular sarardı.. yüzün perde perde solmakta,''
:''Kızıl havaları seyret ki akşam olmakta...''<ref>''Bütün Kitapları'', 36</ref>

:Slowly you will ascend these stairs,
:A bundle of sun-colored leaves on your skirts
:Then a moment you will look, weeping, at the skies...

:The waters yellow.. as your face pales bit by bit,
:Watch the reddened air for the evening sets in

This poem also shows one of the [[Trope (linguistics)|tropes]] that Hâşim shares with the Symbolists; namely, he uses carefully selected natural images to express the emotional state of the poem's [[persona]]. Many of Hâşim's later poems, especially those collected in ''Piyâle'', use this technique in a very brief and evocative fashion, showing the influence not only of Symbolism, but also of the [[haiku]] poetry that Hâşim was reading at the time.

Ahmet Haşim founded a literary magazine, ''[[Dergâh]]'', in 1921 together with another significant figure [[Yahya Kemal]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Adem Can|title=Dergâh’tan Büyük Doğu’ya ilk dönem Cumhuriyet Devri poetika muhitlerinde şiiri tarif denemeleri|journal=Turkish Studies|date=2011|volume=6|issue=1|page=864|doi=10.7827/TurkishStudies.1768|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.7827/TurkishStudies.1768|doi-access=free}}</ref>
