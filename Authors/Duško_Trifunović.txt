'''Duško Trifunović''' ({{lang-sr|Душко Трифуновић}}, 13 September 1933 – 28 January 2006) was a Yugoslav writer, poet and television author.

==Life==
Born in the small village of [[Sijekovac]] near [[Brod, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosanski Brod]] (then part of the [[Vrbas Banovina]], [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]) to father Vaso and illiterate mother Petra, Trifunović didn't have much formal schooling since he started working in a factory during his early teens. Working as a [[Locksmithing|locksmith]] affixing train wagon doors, he eventually moved to [[Sarajevo]] in 1957 at the age of 24 to continue the same line of work. Parallel to his factory work, he also secretly wrote poetry and once in Sarajevo finally got a chance to pursue it in earnest. He published his first book in 1958, and over the next 48 years wrote 84 poetry books, four novels, and several dramas.

He also wrote over 300 song lyrics, most notably for [[Bijelo dugme]] (nation-wide hits "[[Ne gledaj me tako i ne ljubi me više]]" "[[Šta bi dao da si na mom mjestu]]", "Doživjeti stotu", "Pristao sam biću sve što hoće", and "Ima neka tajna veza", as well as other tracks like "Glavni junak jedne knjige" and "Ništa mudro"), [[Indexi]] (hit "I pad je let"), [[Zdravko Čolić]] (hit "Glavo luda"), [[Vajta]] (hit "Zlatna ribica"), [[Jadranka Stojaković]], [[Neda Ukraden]], and [[Željko Joksimović]] ("Ima nešto u tom što me nećeš").

Trifunović also authored several children's books and created several children programs for [[Televizija Sarajevo]], the most prominent being ''Šta djeca znaju o zavičaju'' (''What children know about the homeland'').

Since 1992, he divided his time between [[Novi Sad]] and [[Sremski Karlovci]] in Serbia, working on [[Radio Television Novi Sad]] (RTNS) until retirement. He received Branko's award, City of Sarajevo April 6 Award, Federal and many other acknowledgments.

He died on 28 January 2006 in Novi Sad (at the time [[Serbia and Montenegro]]) at the age of 72,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.klix.ba/magazin/kultura/preminuo-pjesnik-dusko-trifunovic/060128011|title=Preminuo pjesnik Duško Trifunović|date=28 January 2006|access-date=15 May 2020|language=bs|publisher=Klix.ba}}</ref> and was interred at the Čerat Cemetery in Sremski Karlovci where he had lived during the last years of his life.
