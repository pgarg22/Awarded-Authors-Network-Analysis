'''Hugo Laurenz August Hofmann von Hofmannsthal''' ({{IPA-de|ˈhuːɡo fɔn ˈhoːfmanstaːl|lang}}; 1 February 1874 – 15 July 1929) was an Austrian [[novelist]], [[libretto|librettist]], [[Poetry|poet]], [[Playwright|dramatist]], narrator, and [[essay]]ist.

==Early life==
[[File:H. von Hofmannsthal2.jpg|thumb|The house where Hofmannsthal was born, at Salesianergasse&nbsp;12, [[Landstraße]], Vienna&nbsp;3{{sfn|Volke|1967|p=10}}]]
Hofmannsthal was born in [[Landstraße]], Vienna, the son of an upper-class Christian Austrian mother, Anna Maria Josefa Fohleutner (1852–1904), and a Christian Austrian–Italian bank manager, Hugo August Peter Hofmann, Edler von Hofmannsthal (1841–1915).

His great-grandfather, [[Isaak Löw Hofmann, Edler von Hofmannsthal]], from whom his family inherited the noble title "[[Edler]] von Hofmannsthal", was a Jewish tobacco farmer ennobled by the Austrian emperor.

He was schooled in Vienna at [[Akademisches Gymnasium]], where he studied the works of [[Ovid]], later a major influence on his work.<ref name="Olive2019">{{cite journal|last1=Olive|first1=Peter|title=Reinventing the barbarian: Electra, sibling incest, and twentieth-century Hellenism|journal=Classical Receptions Journal|volume=11|issue=4|year=2019|page=414|issn=1759-5142|doi=10.1093/crj/clz012}}</ref> He began to write poems and plays from an early age. Some of his early works were written under pseudonyms, such as ''Loris Melikow'' and ''Theophil Morren'', because he was not allowed to publish as a student. He met the German poet [[Stefan George]] at the age of seventeen and had several poems published in George's journal, ''Blätter für die Kunst''. He studied [[law]] and later [[philology]] in Vienna but decided to devote himself to writing upon graduating in 1901. Along with [[Peter Altenberg]] and [[Arthur Schnitzler]], he was a member of the [[Avant-garde|avant garde]] group [[Young Vienna]] (''Jung–Wien'').

==Career==
In 1900 Hofmannsthal met the [[composer]] [[Richard Strauss]] for the first time. He later wrote [[libretto|libretti]] for several of his [[opera]]s, including ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'' (1909), ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'' (1911), the plot of which he developed together with [[Harry Graf Kessler]], ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos]]'' (1912, rev. 1916), ''[[Die Frau ohne Schatten]]'' (1919), ''[[Die ägyptische Helena]]'' (1928), and ''[[Arabella]]'' (1929, but first performed 1933).

In 1911 he adapted the 15th century English [[morality play]] ''[[Everyman (play)|Everyman]]'' as ''[[Jedermann (play)|Jedermann]]'', and Einar Nilson wrote the music for it. The play later became a staple at the [[Salzburg Festival]].

During [[World War I]] Hofmannsthal held a government post. He wrote speeches and articles supporting the war effort, and emphasizing the cultural tradition of [[Austria-Hungary]]. The end of the war spelled the end of the [[Habsburg monarchy]] in Austria; this was a blow from which the patriotic and conservative-minded Hofmannsthal never fully recovered.

Nevertheless, the years after the war were very productive ones for Hofmannsthal; he continued with his earlier literary projects, almost without a break. He wrote several new libretti for Richard Strauss operas. In 1920, Hofmannsthal, along with [[Max Reinhardt]], founded the Salzburg Festival.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://archive.salzburgerfestspiele.at/en/history| title = The History of the Salzburg Festival| accessdate = October 26, 2021| website = salzburgerfestspiele.at}}</ref> His later plays revealed a growing interest in [[religion|religious]], particularly [[Roman Catholicism in Austria|Roman Catholic]], themes. Among his writings was a screenplay for [[Der Rosenkavalier (1926 film)|a film version]] of ''Der Rosenkavalier'' (1925) directed by [[Robert Wiene]].

==Personal life==
In 1901 he married Gertrud "Gerty" Schlesinger, the daughter of a Viennese Jewish banker. Gerty converted to Christianity before their marriage, and they settled in [[Rodaun]] (now part of [[Liesing]]), not far from [[Vienna]], and had three children:

* Christiane von Hofmannsthal (1902–1987), who married German [[Indology|indologist]] [[Heinrich Zimmer]] in early 1929. Zimmer taught at [[University of Greifswald]], [[Heidelberg University]], and [[Balliol College, Oxford]]. After they moved to [[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle]], he became a visiting lecturer at [[Columbia University]]. 
* Franz von Hofmannsthal (1903–1929), who committed suicide on 13 July 1929.
* Raimund von Hofmannsthal (1906–1974), who married [[Ava Alice Muriel Astor]], daughter of [[John Jacob Astor IV]] and [[Ava Lowle Willing]] in 1933.<ref>{{cite news |title=Astor Heiress Wed Quietly in Jersey.

Two days after his elder son committed suicide, shortly after attending Franz's funeral, Hugo himself died of a stroke at Rodaun. He was buried wearing the habit of a [[Third Order of Saint Francis|Franciscan tertiary]], as he had requested.

==Thought==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2021}}
On 18 October 1902 Hofmannsthal published a fictive letter in the Berlin Daily, ''Der Tag'' (''The Day'') titled simply [[The Lord Chandos Letter|"Ein Brief" ("A Letter")]]. It was purportedly written in 1603 by Philip, Lord Chandos to [[Francis Bacon]]. In this letter Chandos says that he has stopped writing because he has "lost completely the ability to think or to speak of anything coherently"; he has given up on the possibility of language to describe the world. This letter reflects the growing distrust of and dissatisfaction with language that so characterizes the Modern era, and Chandos's dissolving personality is not only individual but societal.

Growing up the son of a wealthy merchant who was well connected with the major artists of the time, Hofmannsthal was raised in what [[Carl Emil Schorske|Carl Schorske]] refers to as "the temple of art". This perfect setting for aesthetic isolation allowed Hofmannsthal the unique perspective of the privileged artist, but also allowed him to see that art had become a flattened documenting of humanity, which took our instincts and desires and framed them for viewing without acquiring any of the living, passionate elements. Because of this realization, Hofmannsthal’s idea of the role of the artist began to take shape as someone who created works that would inspire or inflame the instinct, rather than merely preserving it in a creative form. He also began to think that the artist should not be someone isolated and left to his art, but rather a man of the world, immersed in both politics and art.

Hofmannsthal saw in English culture the ideal setting for the artist. This was because the English simultaneously admired [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Admiral Nelson]] and [[John Milton]], both war heroes and poets, while still maintaining a solid national identity. "In [Hofmannsthal’s] view, the division between artist (writer) and man of action (politician, explorer, soldier) does not exist in England. Britain provides her subjects with a common base of energy which functions as equilibrium, a force lacking in fragmented Germany" (Weiss). This singular and yet pragmatic identity must have appealed to Hofmannsthal to a certain degree due to the large scale fragmentation of Austria at the time, which was witnessing the birth of radical nationalism and anti-Semitism, a nation in which the progressive artist and the progressive politician were growing more different and hostile to each other by the day.

== Influence ==
The [[Austria]]n author [[Stefan Zweig]] wrote in his memoirs ''[[The World of Yesterday]]'' (1942) on Hofmannsthal's early accomplishments and their influence on Zweig's generation:
{{Quote|The appearance of the young Hofmannsthal is and remains notable as one of the greatest miracles of accomplishment early in life; in world literature, except for [[John Keats|Keats]] and [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]], I know no other youthful example of a similar impeccability in the mastering of language, no such breadth of spiritual buoyancy, nothing more permeated with poetic substance even in the most casual lines, than in this magnificent genius, who already in his sixteenth and seventeenth year had inscribed himself in the eternal annals of the German language with unextinguishable verses and prose which today has still not been surpassed. His sudden beginning and simultaneous completion was a phenomenon that hardly occurs more than once in a generation.|Stefan Zweig|''[[Die Welt von Gestern]]'', Frankfurt am Main 1986, 63–64}}
