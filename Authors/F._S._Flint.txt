'''Frank Stuart Flint''' (19 December 1885 – 28 February 1960) was an English poet and translator who was a prominent member of the [[Imagist]] group. [[Ford Madox Ford]] called him "one of the greatest men and one of the beautiful spirits of the country".<ref>Hughes.Glenn.''Imagism and the Imagists'',Stanford University Press (1931) ASIN: B000SND146</ref>

==Life and career==
Flint was a British poet and poetry reviewer with an unusual gift for language. A self-educated man<ref>Pondrom, Cryrena, ''The Road from Paris, French Influence on English Poetry 1900-1920'' Cambridge University Press 1974 {{ISBN|9780521131193}}</ref> born in [[Islington]], London, Flint left school at 13 and worked in various capacities before beginning his long and distinguished career in the Civil Service in 1904.<ref>Obituary , Frank S. Flint, 'Imagist Poet', ''The Times'', 29 February 1960</ref> He published a book on [[French poetry|French poets]] , starting in [[1908 in literature|1908]] and by 1910, his intensive private study had gained him recognition as one of Britain's most highly informed authorities on modern French poetry. His first collection of poems, ''In the Net of the Stars'' (1909), consisted mainly of conventional love lyrics.

Flint is mostly known for his participation in the "School of Images" with [[Ezra Pound]] and [[T. E. Hulme]] in [[1909 in literature|1909]], of which he gave an account in the "Poetry Review" in 1909,<ref>''Verse Chronicle'' ,article, ''The Criterion'' in 1932</ref>  and which was to serve as the theoretical basis for the later Imagist movement ([[1913 in literature|1913]]). His subsequent association with [[Ezra Pound]] and [[T. E. Hulme]], together with his deepening knowledge of innovative French poetic techniques, radically affected his poetry's development.

Glenn Hughes reports Flint 'claiming  to  inventing the open verse form  'unrimed [[Cadence (poetry)|cadence]]', by cutting away all personal emotion, where symbolism  was barely suggested, but instead shortened and hardened, and where meter was supplanted by cadence'.
Hughes explaining Flint's form is best understood 'by comparing  his poem ' A Swan Song'(Published in 1909 and later by Pound in  1914 in  'Des Imagistes') and, his later 'cadenced ' version thereof, ' The Swan', a poem so devoid of superfluities  and  cliches,  to achieve that perfect chiseled beauty which is the essence of classical art' <ref>Hughes, Glenn, ''Imagism and the Imagists'' Stanford University Press, 1931</ref>

In 1916 Flint was described as having ' the gift of artistic courage clothed in beauty which will help build the poetry of the future'.<ref>Michelson, Max Review of 'Cadences' , Poetry Vol 8, no 5 August 1916</ref> Flint himself, considered his 'cadenced' form to be a reversion to the real tradition of the English poetry of [[Cynewulf]] in the 'Riddle, The Nightingale'<ref>Flint F.S, Preface,  'Otherworld, Cadences' Poetry Bookshop London 1920</ref>

Earlier Flint had published  a series of articles on contemporary French poets ([[1912 in literature|1912]]) that much influenced his contemporaries. In 1914 he was included by Pound in [[Des Imagistes]]. He entered into a short-lived dispute with Pound as to each one's relative contribution to the Imagist movement.

During the 1930s Flint was among a number of poets who moved away from poetry and towards economics, working for the Statistics Division of the Ministry of Labour <ref>[[C. H. Sisson|Sisson C. H.]] (1981) [1971]. ''English Poetry 1900–1950: An Assessment''. London: Methuen. {{ISBN|0-416-32100-3}}</ref> writing that "[t]he proper study of mankind is, for the time being, economics".<ref>[C K Stead, 'Pound, Yeats, Eliot and the Modernist Movement', p.&nbsp;212]</ref> Flint would go on to publish an article entitled ''The Plain Man and Economics'' in ''The Criterion'' in 1937. He became a leading spokesman for Imagism and exemplified its methods in the concentration and clarity displayed by much of the work in Cadences (1915). ''Otherworld'', his third and last collection, was published in 1920, its lengthy title poem responding to the desolation of the First World War in its meditations on more viable modes of existence. For some years after he ceased publishing poetry, Flint continued to contribute influential articles to the ''Times Literary Supplement'' and ''The Criterion''. He was also a prolific translator of prose works and poetry by French, German, and classical authors.

With the exception of some short works arising from his activities as a civil servant, he ceased writing for publication entirely in the early 1930s.
