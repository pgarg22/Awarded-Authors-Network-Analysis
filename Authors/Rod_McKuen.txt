'''Rodney Marvin McKuen''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|k|j|uː|ə|n}}; April 29, 1933 – January 29, 2015) was an American poet, singer-songwriter, and actor. He was one of the best-selling poets in the United States during the late 1960s. Throughout his career, McKuen produced a wide range of recordings, which included popular music, spoken word poetry, film soundtracks and classical music. He earned two [[Academy Award]] nominations and one [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer]] nomination for his music compositions. McKuen's translations and adaptations of the songs of [[Jacques Brel]] were instrumental in bringing the Belgian songwriter to prominence in the English-speaking world. His poetry deals with themes of love, the natural world and spirituality. McKuen's songs sold over 100 million recordings worldwide, and 60 million books of his poetry were sold as well.<ref name="wsj"/>

==Early years==
McKuen was born on April 29, 1933,<ref>{{Cite web| last = Schudel| first = Matt| title = Rod McKuen, popular poet, singer and songwriter who was a '60s bard, dies at 81 | work = The Washington Post (Online)| accessdate = 2021-09-01| date = 2015| url = http://www.proquest.com/docview/1649939336/citation/100D7D89D5964009PQ/5}}</ref> in a Salvation Army hostel in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[California]].<ref name=independent/> He never knew his biological father, who had left his mother.<ref name="nytimes-obit"/> Sexually and physically abused by relatives,<ref name=theguardian>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/01/rod-mckuen|title= Rod McKuen obituary |author= Michael Carlson| work=[[The Guardian]] |access-date= February 5, 2016|date=February 1, 2015}}</ref> raised by his mother and stepfather, who was a violent alcoholic, McKuen ran away from home at the age of 11. He drifted along the West Coast, supporting himself as a ranch hand, surveyor, railroad worker, lumberjack, rodeo cowboy, stuntman, and radio disc jockey, always sending money home to his mother.<ref name="allmusic-bio"/>

To compensate for his lack of formal education, McKuen began keeping a journal, which resulted in his first poetry and song lyrics. After dropping out of [[Oakland Technical High School]] prior to graduating in 1951,<ref>{{cite web|title=Rod McKuen, Class of 1951|url=http://oaklandtech.com/staff/centennial/2015/03/14/rod-mckuen-51/|website=School Historical Archive|date=March 14, 2015|access-date=25 February 2016}}</ref> McKuen worked as a newspaper columnist and propaganda script writer during the [[Korean War]]. He settled in San Francisco, where he read his poetry in clubs alongside Beat poets like [[Jack Kerouac]] and [[Allen Ginsberg]].<ref name="nytimes-obit"/>  He began performing as a folk singer at the famed [[The Purple Onion|Purple Onion]]. Over time, he began incorporating his own songs into his act. He was signed to [[Decca Records]] and released several pop albums in the late 1950s. McKuen also appeared as an actor in ''[[Rock, Pretty Baby]]'' (1956), ''[[Summer Love (1958 film)|Summer Love]]'' (1958), and the western ''[[Wild Heritage]]'' (1958). He also sang with [[Lionel Hampton|Lionel Hampton's band]]. In 1959, McKuen moved to New York City to compose and conduct music for the TV show ''[[CBS Television Workshop|The CBS Workshop]]''.<ref name="allmusic-bio"/>  McKuen appeared on ''[[To Tell The Truth]]'' on June 18, 1962 as a decoy contestant and described himself as "a published poet and a twist singer."<ref>{{cite web|title=Rod McKuen|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0572106/?ref_=nv_sr_1/|website=imdb.com|access-date=14 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=To Tell The Truth |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5QTF4AER3g|website=CBS |access-date=25 April 2020}}</ref>

==Discovering Jacques Brel==
In the early 1960s, McKuen moved to France, where he first met the Belgian singer-songwriter and [[chanson]] singer [[Jacques Brel]]. McKuen began to translate the work of this composer into English, which led to the song "[[If You Go Away]]" – an international pop-standard – based on Brel's "[[Ne me quitte pas]]". McKuen translated Brel's song "[[Le Moribond]]" loosely into "[[Seasons in the Sun]]", and British folkbeat group [[The Fortunes]] charted with the song in the Netherlands in 1969. In 1974, singer [[Terry Jacks]] turned McKuen's "[[Seasons in the Sun]]", into a best-selling pop hit, and also charted with a cover of "If You Go Away." McKuen also translated songs by other French songwriters, including [[Georges Moustaki]], [[Gilbert Bécaud]], [[Pierre Delanoé]], [[Michel Sardou]], and others.<ref name="allmusic-bio"/>

In 1978, after hearing of Brel's death, McKuen was quoted as saying, "As friends and as musical collaborators we had traveled, toured and written – together and apart – the events of our lives as if they were songs, and I guess they were. When news of Jacques' death came I stayed locked in my bedroom and drank for a week. That kind of self-pity was something he wouldn't have approved of, but all I could do was replay our songs (our children) and ruminate over our unfinished life together."<ref name="rm-flightplan"/>

==Poetry==
In the late 1960s, McKuen began to publish books of poetry, earning a substantial following among young people with collections like ''Stanyan Street & Other Sorrows'' (1966), ''Listen to the Warm'' (1967), and ''Lonesome Cities'' (1968). His ''Lonesome Cities'' album of readings won a Grammy for Best Spoken Word Recording in 1968.<ref name="allmusic-bio"/> McKuen's poems were translated into eleven languages and his books sold over 1 million copies in 1968 alone.<ref name="hoffmann"/> McKuen said that his most romantic poetry was influenced by American poet [[Walter Benton (poet)|Walter Benton]]'s two books of poems.<ref name="rm-flightplan"/> McKuen sold over 60 million books worldwide, according to the Associated Press.<ref name="wsj"/>

==Songwriting==
McKuen wrote over 1,500 songs, which have accounted for the sale of over 100 million records worldwide according to the Associated Press.<ref name="wsj"/> His songs have been performed by such diverse artists as [[Robert Goulet]], [[Glenn Yarbrough]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Perry Como]], [[Petula Clark]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[The Boston Pops]], [[Chet Baker]], [[Jimmie Rodgers (pop singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Pete Fountain]], [[Andy Williams]], the [[Kingston Trio]], [[Percy Faith]], the [[London Philharmonic]], [[Nana Mouskouri]], [[Dusty Springfield]], [[Johnny Mathis]], [[Al Hirt]], [[Greta Keller]], [[Gene Ween|Aaron Freeman]], and [[Frank Sinatra]].<ref name="nytimes-obit"/><ref name="new-yorker-greenman"/><ref name="billboard-caulfield"/>

In 1959, McKuen released his first novelty single with [[Bob McFadden]], under the pseudonym Dor on the Brunswick label, called "The Mummy". The McKuen-written song reached No. 39 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot 100|pop chart]].<ref name="Whitburn 2013 556">{{cite book|first=Joel|last=Whitburn|year=2013|title=Top Pop Singles 1955-2012|edition=14th|publisher=Record Research Inc.|location=Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin|isbn= 978-0-89820-205-2|page=556}}</ref> In 1961, he had a hit single titled "Oliver Twist". He co-wrote it along with [[Gladys Shelley]] and the Spiral label-issued single reached No. 76 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot 100|pop chart]].<ref name="Whitburn 2013 560">{{cite book|first=Joel|last=Whitburn|year=2013|title=Top Pop Singles 1955-2012|edition=14th|publisher=Record Research Inc.|location=Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin|isbn= 978-0-89820-205-2|page=560}}</ref>  His hoarse and throaty singing voice on these and other recordings was a result of McKuen straining his vocal cords in 1961, due to too many promotional appearances.<ref name=independent>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/rod-mckuen-poet-songwriter-and-distinctively-voiced-singer-who-was-nominated-for-an-oscar-and-worked-with-jacques-brel-and-frank-sinatra-10014815.html|title=Rod McKuen: Poet, songwriter and distinctively voiced singer who was nominated for an Oscar and worked with Jacques Brel and Frank Sinatra|date=January 30, 2015|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref>

He collaborated with numerous composers, including [[Henry Mancini]], [[John Williams]], and [[Anita Kerr]]. His symphonies, concertos, and other orchestral works have been performed by orchestras around the globe. His work as a composer in the film industry garnered him two [[Academy Award]] nominations for ''[[The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (film)|The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie]]'' (1969) and ''[[A Boy Named Charlie Brown]]'' (1969),<ref name="billboard-caulfield"/> and his other film scores have included ''[[Joanna (1968 film)|Joanna]]'' (1968), ''[[Me, Natalie]]'' (1969), ''[[Scandalous John]]'' (1971), ''[[The Borrowers (1973 film)|The Borrowers]]'' (1973) and ''[[Emily (1976 film)|Emily]]'' (1976). McKuen's contribution to ''A Boy Named Charlie Brown'', the first feature-length animation based on [[Charles M. Schulz]]'s comic strip, ''[[Peanuts]]'', also included singing the title song.  McKuen also earned a mention in the ''Peanuts'' strip dated October 3, 1969, in which [[Sally Brown]] expresses her frustration that she was sent to the principal's office for an outburst in art class, opining that [[Pablo Picasso]] and Rod McKuen surely must have had trouble drawing cows' legs when they were young.

In 1967, McKuen began collaborating with arranger [[Anita Kerr]] and the San Sebastian Strings for a series of albums featuring McKuen's poetry recited over Kerr's [[beautiful music|mood music]], including ''The Sea'' (1967), ''The Earth'' (1967), ''The Sky'' (1968), ''Home to the Sea'' (1969), ''For Lovers'' (1969), and ''The Soft Sea'' (1970). [[Jesse Pearson (actor)|Jesse Pearson]] was the narrator of ''The Sea'' and its follow-ups ''Home to the Sea'' and ''The Soft Sea'', while most other albums in the series had McKuen narrating. In 1969, [[Frank Sinatra]] commissioned an entire album of poems and songs by McKuen; arranged by [[Don Costa]], it was released under the title ''[[A Man Alone (album)|A Man Alone: The Words and Music of Rod McKuen]]''. The album featured the song "Love's Been Good to Me", which became one of McKuen's best-known songs.<ref name="allmusic-bio"/>

McKuen performed solo in a half-hour special broadcast by [[NBC]] on May 10, 1969. The program, billed as McKuen's "first television special", featured the songs "The Loner", "The World I Used to Know", "The Complete Madame Butterfly", "I've Been to Town", "Kaleidoscope", "Stanyan Street", "Lonesome Cities", "Listen to the Warm", "Trashy", and "Merci Beaucoup". It was produced by [[Lee Mendelson]], producer of the ''[[Peanuts]]'' specials, and directed by [[Marty Pasetta]]. [[James Trittipo]] designed a set that was "evocative of waterfront pilings" and [[Arthur Greenslade]] conducted the orchestra.<ref name="tvguide"/> In 1971, he hosted a series, ''The Rod McKuen Show'', on BBC television in the UK.<ref>[http://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/obituaries/13200016.Rod_McKuen/ ''Herald Scotland'' obituary, 3 February 2015]. Accessed 11 August 2015</ref>

McKuen's Academy Award-nominated composition "[[Jean (song)|Jean]]", sung by [[Oliver (singer)|Oliver]], reached No.1 in 1969 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] chart and stayed there for four weeks.<ref name="whitburn">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Top Adult Songs 1961-2006|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2007|isbn= 978-0-89820-169-7}}</ref> In 1971, his song "I Think of You" was a major hit for [[Perry Como]]. Other popular McKuen compositions included "The World I Used to Know", "Rock Gently", "Doesn't Anybody Know My Name", "The Importance of the Rose", "Without a Worry in the World", and "Soldiers Who Want to Be Heroes".<ref name="allmusic-bio"/>

In 1971, McKuen became popular in the Netherlands, where the singles "Soldiers Who Want to Be Heroes" and "Without a Worry in the World" reached number one in the charts, as did the album ''Greatest Hits, Vol. 3''. All three discs earned him [[gold record]]s; in 1971 he was voted the Netherlands' most popular entertainer by [[Radio Veronica]]'s audience.<ref>Rod McKuen in Concert Brochure, 1972, Cheval/Stanyan Company, Hollywood</ref>

During the 1970s, McKuen began composing larger-scale orchestral compositions, writing a series of concertos, suites, symphonies, and chamber pieces for orchestra.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thegayalmanac.com/2018/04/born-today-in-1933-poet-singer.html|title=Born Today in 1933, Poet, Singer-Songwrier Rod McKuen|access-date=2019-08-29}}</ref> His piece ''The City: A Suite for Narrator & Orchestra'' was nominated for the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in Music.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/01/rod-mckuen|title=Rod McKuen obituary|last=Carlson|first=Michael|date=2015-02-01|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-06-06|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> He continued publishing a steady stream of poetry books throughout the decade.<ref name=":0" /> In 1977, he published ''Finding My Father'', a chronicle of his search for information on his biological father.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/rod-mckuen|title=Rod McKuen|last=Foundation|first=Poetry|date=2019-06-06|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en|access-date=2019-06-06}}</ref> The book and its publicity helped make such information more readily available to adopted children.<ref name=":0" /> He also continued to record, releasing albums such as ''New Ballads'' (1970), ''Pastorale'' (1971), and the country-rock outing ''McKuen Country'' (1976).<ref name="allmusic-bio"/>

McKuen continued to perform concerts around the world and appeared regularly at New York's [[Carnegie Hall]] throughout the 1970s, making sporadic appearances as recently as the early 2000s.

==Later years==
In 1973, at forty, McKuen radically changed his outward appearance: he no longer bleached his hair and he grew a beard.

McKuen retired from live performances in 1981. The following year, he was diagnosed with clinical depression, which he battled for much of the next decade. He continued to write poetry, however, and made appearances as a voice-over actor in ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' and the TV series ''[[The Critic]]''.<ref name="allmusic-bio"/>

2001 saw the publication of McKuen's ''A Safe Place to Land'', which contains 160 pages of new poetry. For 10 years he gave an annual birthday concert at [[Carnegie Hall]] or the [[Lincoln Center]]. He released the double CD ''The Platinum Collection'' and was remastering all of his [[RCA]] and [[Warner Bros.]] recordings for release as CD boxed sets. In addition to his artistic pursuits he was the Executive President of the [[American Guild of Variety Artists]] (AGVA), a post he held longer than any other man or woman elected to the position.

McKuen lived in [[Beverly Hills, California]] with his partner Edward, whom he called his "brother", and four cats in a large rambling Spanish house built in 1928, which housed one of the world's largest private record collections.<ref name="rm-bio"/> He died of respiratory arrest, a result of pneumonia, at a hospital in Beverly Hills, California, on January 29, 2015.<ref name="nytimes-obit"/>

==LGBT activism==

McKuen refused to identify as [[homosexuality|gay]], [[heterosexuality|straight]], or [[bisexuality|bisexual]], but once explained his sexuality saying, "I can't imagine choosing one sex over the other, that's just too limiting. I can't even honestly say I have a preference."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rodmckuen.org/flights/280604.htm|title=Rod McKuen - Flight Plan|website=www.rodmckuen.org|access-date=2016-10-13}}</ref> He was active in the [[LGBT]] rights movement, and as early as the 1950s, was a key member of the San Francisco chapter of the [[Mattachine Society]], one of the nation's earliest LGBT advocacy organizations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Timeline: Milestones in the American Gay Rights Movement|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/timeline/stonewall/|website=PBP:American Experience|access-date=21 November 2016}}</ref>  The cover of McKuen's 1977 album ''Slide... Easy In'' featured a photo of a man's arm gripping a handful of [[vegetable shortening]]; the can was a pastiche of [[Crisco]] – then widely used by gay men as a sexual lubricant – with the label instead reading "Disco".  That same year, McKuen spoke out against singer [[Anita Bryant]] and her "[[Save Our Children]]" campaign to repeal an anti-discrimination ordinance in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], tagging Bryant with the nickname "Ginny Orangeseed", and also including a song on ''Slide... Easy In'' titled "Don't Drink the Orange Juice", referencing Bryant's fame as commercial pitchwoman for the Florida Citrus Commission. He often gave benefit performances to aid LGBT rights organizations and to fund [[AIDS]] research.<ref>[http://notchesblog.com/2015/02/19/not-by-my-definition-remembering-rod-mckuens-queer-life-and-times/ Straight After Death: Misremembering the Queer Life and Times of Rod McKuen], Notches.  Retrieved 24 June 2016.</ref>

==Criticism==
Despite his popular appeal, McKuen's work was never taken seriously by critics or academics. Michael Baers observed in Gale Research's ''St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture'' that "through the years his books have drawn uniformly unkind reviews. In fact, criticism of his poetry is uniformly vituperative ..."<ref>{{Citation | first = Michael | last = Baers | contribution = Rod McKuen | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_bio/ai_2419200821/?tag=content;col1 | title = Find articles}}.</ref>

Frank W. Hoffmann, in ''Arts and Entertainment Fads'', described McKuen's poetry as "tailor-made for the 1960s ... poetry with a verse that drawled in country cadences from one shapeless line to the next, carrying the rusticated innocence of a Carl Sandburg thickened by the treacle of a man who preferred to prettify the world before he described it".<ref name="hoffmann"/>

Philosopher and social critic [[Robert C. Solomon]] described McKuen's poetry as "sweet [[kitsch]],"<ref>{{cite book |title=In Defense of Sentimentality |url=https://archive.org/details/indefenseofsenti0000solo |url-access=registration |last=Solomon |first=Robert C. | year=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA | isbn = 0-19-514550-X |page= [https://archive.org/details/indefenseofsenti0000solo/page/236 236]}}</ref> and, at the height of his popularity in 1969, ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine called him "the King of Kitsch."<ref>{{Citation | title = King of Kitsch | newspaper = Newsweek | date = November 4, 1968 | pages = 111, 114}}.</ref>

Writer and literary critic [[Nora Ephron]] said, "[F]or the most part, McKuen's poems are superficial and platitudinous and frequently silly." [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry|Pulitzer Prize]]-winning [[United States Poet Laureate|US Poet Laureate]] [[Karl Shapiro]] said, "It is irrelevant to speak of McKuen as a poet."<ref>{{cite book |title=Wallflower at the Orgy |last=Ephron |first=Nora | year=2007 |publisher=Bantam | isbn=978-0-553-38505-2 |page= 181}}</ref>

In a ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' interview with McKuen in 2001 as he was "testing the waters" for a [[Comeback (publicity)|comeback]] tour, Pulitzer Prize-winning culture critic [[Julia Keller]] claimed that "Millions more have loathed him [...] finding his work so schmaltzy and smarmy that it makes the pronouncements of [[Kathie Lee Gifford]] sound like [[Susan Sontag]]," and that his work "drives many people crazy. They find it silly and mawkish, the kind of gooey schmaltz that wouldn't pass muster in a freshman creative-writing class" while stating that "The masses ate him up with a spoon, while highbrow literary critics roasted him on a spit." She noted that the third concert on his tour had already been canceled because of sluggish ticket sales.<ref name=keller1>{{cite news|title=Where Had You Gone, Rod Mckuen? |last=Keller |first=Julia |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-03-06/features/0103060005_1_modern-times-concerts-susan-sontag |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=March 6, 2001 |access-date=2011-12-17 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/640cMBeaw?url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-03-06/features/0103060005_1_modern-times-concerts-susan-sontag |archive-date=December 17, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In May 2019, Backbeat Books published ''A Voice of the Warm: The Life of Rod McKuen'' by Barry Alfonso. This was the first in-depth biography of McKuen. In his introduction to the book, singer and music historian [[Michael Feinstein]] wrote that McKuen's life and work held a significant place in pop culture: "[McKuen] knew how to create something that made a reader or listener say, 'That’s me.' Like Gershwin’s, his work is a document of the time in which it was created. But what he did also transcends that time and still speaks fundamentally to the things that matter to people: romance, relationships, the human condition. Those things don’t change. He used the vernacular of his time to reach the widest audience. But at its essence, his work is still valid and, I think, timeless."<ref>{{cite book |title=A Voice of the Warm: The Life of Rod McKuen |last=Alfonso |first=Barry |year=2019 |publisher=Backbeat | isbn=978-1617137099 |pages= x-xi}}.</ref>
