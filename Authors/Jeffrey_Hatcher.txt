He also co-wrote the stage adaptation of ''[[Tuesdays with Morrie]]'' with author [[Mitch Albom]], and ''[[Three Viewings]]'', a comedy consisting of three monologues - each of which takes place in a funeral home.  He wrote the screenplay ''[[Casanova (2005 film)|Casanova]]'' for director [[Lasse Hallström]], as well as the screenplay for ''[[The Duchess (film)|The Duchess]]'' (2008).<ref name=UCReporter>"Psychological Thriller" ''[[The Union City Reporter]]''; April 11, 2010; Page 13.</ref>  He has also written for the Peter Falk TV series ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'' and E!

==Career==

His many award-winning original plays have been performed on Broadway, Off-Broadway, and regionally across the US and abroad.  Some of his plays include ''Three Viewings'', ''Scotland Road'', ''A Picasso'', ''Neddy'', ''Korczak's Children'', ''Mercy of a Storm'', ''Work Song:  Three Views of Frank Lloyd Wright '' (with [[Eric Simonson]]), and ''Lucky Duck'' (with Bill Russell and Henry Kreiger). Hatcher wrote the book for the Broadway musical ''Never Gonna Dance'' and the musical, ''ELLA.''

Hatcher adapted [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s novella, ''[[The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'', into a play in which actors play multiple roles, and [[Mr. Hyde]] is played by four actors, one of whom is female. The adaptation, which has been called "hipper, more erotic, and theatrically intense...definitely not your grandfather's 'Jekyll and Hyde'", was nominated by the Mystery Writers of America for an [[Edgar Award]] for Best Play.<ref name=UCReporter/>

Hatcher is a member and/or alumnus of The Playwrights' Center, The Dramatists Guild of America, Writers Guild of America and New Dramatists.
