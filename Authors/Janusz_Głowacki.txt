==Biography==
Janusz Andrzej Głowacki was born into an [[intelligentsia]] family on 13 September 1938 in [[Poznań]]. He was the son of Helena Głowacka (née Helena Rudzka, d. 1991), a [[literary editor]], sister of Polish [[character actor]], [[Kazimierz Rudzki]]; and Jerzy Głowacki, a [[crime fiction]] novelist.

Głowacki appeared in two plays produced by the Students' Satirical Theatre during his high school years and was interested in serious theater, which led to his enrollment to the [[Aleksander Zelwerowicz National Academy of Dramatic Art in Warsaw]]. He attended Academy, but by his own account had problems adjusting to the college, and dropped out. He later attended the [[University of Warsaw]], where he studied both [[history]] and [[Polish philology]] and eventually earned a Master of Arts in the latter in 1961.

He began his literary career by publishing his collections of [[short story|short stories]] depicting the cultural and social reality of the 1960s and 1970s in Poland, such as ''The Nonsense Spinner'' (1968) and ''The New La-ba-da Dance'' (1970). His works achieved great popularity and made him famous, thanks especially to his satirical portrayal of social phenomena in regularly published articles.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://culture.pl/en/artist/janusz-glowacki |title=Janusz Głowacki|access-date=28 August 2017}}</ref>

He wrote the screenplay for [[Andrzej Wajda]]'s ''[[Polowanie na muchy]]'' (1969) (''Hunting Flies'') and co-wrote the screenplay of the popular Polish movie ''[[Rejs]]'' (''The Cruise''), released in 1970.<ref name="wp"/> The 2001 film ''[[Mechanical Suite]]'' is based on his short story ''Brothers''. Głowacki co-wrote screenplay for ''[[Cold War (2018 film)|Cold War]]'', which was selected to compete for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2018 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name="select">{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/infos-communiques/communique/articles/the-2018-official-selection|title=The 2018 Official Selection|work=Cannes|accessdate=12 April 2018}}</ref><ref name="Variety">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/cannes-lineup-includes-new-films-from-spike-lee-jean-luc-godard-1202751300/|title=Cannes Lineup Includes New Films From Spike Lee, Jean-Luc Godard|work=Variety|accessdate=12 April 2018}}</ref>

In 1981 he emigrated to [[New York City]] in the wake of the imposition of [[martial law in Poland]] by its Communist government. There, he was nominated for the [[Helen Hayes Awards Resident Production|Charles MacArthur Award for Outstanding New Play]] for ''Antigone in New York'' (1994).<ref name="helenHayes1994">{{Citation

Głowacki taught creative writing at [[Columbia University]] and [[Bennington College]]. Additionally he worked as the visiting playwright at [[New York Public Theater]], [[Mark Taper Forum]] and [[Atlantic Center for the Arts]].

On August 19, 2017, Głowacki died unexpectedly during his holidays in [[Egypt]].
