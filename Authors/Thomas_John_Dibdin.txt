'''Thomas John Dibdin''' (21 March 1771 &ndash; 16 September 1841) was an [[England|English]] [[dramatist]] and songwriter.

==Life==
Dibdin was the son of [[Charles Dibdin]], a songwriter and theatre manager, and of "Mrs Davenet", an actress whose real name was [[Harriett Pitt]].<ref>[http://www.nmm.ac.uk/researchers/collections/by-type/archive-and-library/item-of-the-month/previous/the-english-fleet-in-1342 The English Fleet], National Maritime Museum, retrieved 8 February 2015</ref> He was introduced to the stage at five years old, in his godfather David Garrick’s pageant of ‘’Jubilee of Shakespeare’’. Mrs Siddons was The Venus and the Young Tom Cupid.<ref>{{cite news|title=Thomas Dibdin|newspaper=Stamford Mercury|date=24 September 1841}}</ref> He was apprenticed to his maternal uncle, a [[London]] upholsterer, and later to William Rawlins, afterwards [[sheriff of London]]. He summoned his second master unsuccessfully for rough treatment; and after a few years of service he ran away to join a company of country players. From 1789 to 1795 he played all sorts of parts; he worked as a scene painter at [[Liverpool]] in 1791; and during this period he composed more than 1,000 songs.

His first work as a dramatist was ''Something New'', followed by ''The Mad Guardian'' in 1795. He returned to [[London]] in 1795, having married two years before; and in the winter of 1798-99 ''The Jew and the Doctor'' was produced at [[Theatre Royal, Covent Garden]]. From this time he contributed a very large number of [[comedy|comedies]], [[opera]]s, [[farce]]s, etc., to the public entertainment, including (in 1802) the comic opera ''[[Family Quarrels]]''. Some of these brought immense popularity to the writer and immense profits to the theatres. It is stated that the [[pantomime]] of ''Mother Goose'' (1807) produced more than £20,000 for the management at Covent Garden theatre, and the ''High-mettled Racer'', adapted as a pantomime from his father's play, £18,000 at Astley's.

Dibdin was [[Prompter (theatre)|prompter]] and pantomime writer at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] until 1816, when he took over the [[Surrey Theatre]]. This venture proved disastrous, and he became bankrupt. After this, he was manager of the [[Haymarket Theatre]], but without his old success, and his last years were passed in comparative poverty. In 1827 he published two volumes of ''Reminiscences''; and at the time of his death he was preparing an edition of his father's sea songs, for which a small sum was allowed him weekly by the [[Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty|Lords of the Admiralty]]. Of his own songs, "The Oak Table" and "The Snug Little Island" were popular at the time. He died leaving a widow (second wife) and young family.

[[Charles Dickens]] quotes from Dibdin's patriotic song "The Snug Little Island" in ''[[Little Dorrit]]'':
<blockquote>
Daddy Neptune one day to Freedom did say,<br>
"If ever I lived upon dry land.<br>
The spot I should hit on would be little Britain!"<br>
Says Freedom, "Why that's my own island!"<br>
Oh, it's a snug little island!<br>
A right little, tight little island,<br>
Search the globe round, none can be found<br>
So happy as this little island.<br>
</blockquote>
The song was published posthumously in 1841 in the Addenda (containing songs of T. Dibdin) to ''Songs of the Late Charles Dibdin'', a collection arranged by Thomas Dibdin with sketches by [[George Cruikshank]].<ref>Dibdin, Charles and Dibdin, T, ''Songs of the Late Charles Dibdin:with a Memoir, ''London, Henry G. Bohn, 1850, p. 228</ref> A copy was found in Dickens's library after his death.<ref>Philpotts, Trey. ''The Companion to Little Dorrit''. Helm Information Ltd., 2003, p. 96.</ref>
