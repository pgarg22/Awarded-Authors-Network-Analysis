'''Christian Dietrich Grabbe''' (11 December 1801 &ndash; 12 September 1836) was a German [[Playwright|dramatist]] of the ''[[Vormärz]]'' era. He wrote many historical plays conceiving a disillusioned and pessimistic world view, with some shrill scenes. [[Heinrich Heine]] saw him as one of Germany's foremost dramatists, calling him "a drunken [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]" and [[Sigmund Freud]] described Grabbe as "an original and rather peculiar poet."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lob |first1=Ladislaus |editor1-last=Konzett |editor1-first=Matthias |title=Encyclopedia of German Literature. |date=2015 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1135941222 |pages=362–3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5uE4CQAAQBAJ&q=%22a+drunken+Shakespeare%22+Grabbe |accessdate=12 November 2019}}</ref>

==Life==
Born in [[Detmold]],<ref name=TRGG>{{cite book|title=The Rough Guide to Germany|date=July 5, 2012|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9781409359265|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dXu1iwyJzm0C&pg=PT1442 }}</ref>  the son of a prison officer, he began to write plays in the age of sixteen, while attending the ''[[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]]''. A scholarship awarded by Princess [[Princess Pauline of Anhalt-Bernburg|Pauline]] enabled him to study law at the universities of [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]] and [[Humboldt University|Berlin]], where he became acquainted with Heinrich Heine. After graduating in 1823, he unsuccessfully applied as a theatre director.

Grabbe returned to Detmold, he passed the final ''[[Staatsexamen]]'' and tried to find an employment as a legal officer, though also to no avail. Finally in 1826 he was appointed to act as a [[military justice|military legal]] advisor, initially without remuneration. From 1831 he increasingly suffered from alcoholism. After his fiancée turned away from him, he married his beloved Louise Christina Clostermeier in 1833, but the marriage quickly turned out to be unhappy. The next year Grabbe quit and left Detmold for [[Frankfurt]], where he also fell out with his publisher.

He proceeded to [[Düsseldorf]], where he temporarily worked at the [[Altes Theater (Düsseldorf)|Altes Theater]] with [[Karl Leberecht Immermann]]. Grabbe returned to Detmold in 1836 as a broken man, his wife filed for divorce. He died from [[General paresis of the insane|general paresis]] in the same year.

==Legacy==
With [[Georg Büchner]], Grabbe was one of the principal German dramatists of his time. His debut ''Herzog Theodor von Gothland'' overtaxed contemporary critics by its all-pervasive [[nihilism]]. Influenced by Shakespeare and the ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' movement, his plays were very ambitious, with crowd scenes and rapid scene changes that challenged the technical capacity of the theaters of the time. He resolved the strict forms of the [[Classical unities|classical]] drama in a loose series of scenes that were a precursor of the [[Literary realism|realist]] drama. His plays ''Napoleon oder Die hundert Tage'' or ''Hannibal'' reveal a realistic, heterogeneous concept of history.

After his death, he was at first forgotten, but his work was rediscovered by the [[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalist]] and [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] dramatists. He was honored by the [[Nazis]] as a great national poet, based on occasional [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] statements (particularly in ''[[Aschenbrödel]]''), and on his nationalistic portrayal of German history, like ''Die Hermannsschlacht'' on the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]]. In the 1930s, numerous streets were named after him.

The city of Detmold awards the Christian-Dietrich-Grabbe Prize for new dramatic literature since 1994 in association with the ''Grabbe-Gesellschaft'' [[literary society]] and the ''Landesverband Lippe'' municipal association.
