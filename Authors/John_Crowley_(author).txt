'''John Crowley''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|aʊ|l|i}} (born December 1, 1942) is an American author of [[fantasy]], [[science fiction]] and [[historical fiction]]. He has also written [[essay]]s. Crowley studied at [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]] and has a second career as a documentary film writer.

Crowley is best known as the author of ''[[Little, Big]]'' (1981), a work which received [[World Fantasy Award]] for Best Novel and has been called "a neglected masterpiece" by [[Harold Bloom]],<ref>{{cite web |date=December 3, 2008 |first=Alexander |last=Nazaryan |title=Susan Orlean, David Remnick, Ethan Hawke, and Others Pick Their Favorite Obscure Books |publisher=[[Village Voice]] |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2008-12-03/books/susan-orlean-david-remnick-ethan-hawke-and-others-pick-their-favorite-obscure-books/}}</ref> and his [[Ægypt|''Ægypt'' series]] of novels which revolve around the same themes of [[Hermeticism]], memory, families and religion. Some of his nonfiction writing has appeared bimonthly in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' in the form of his "Easy Chair" column, which ended in 2016.

== Biography ==
John Crowley was born in [[Presque Isle, Maine]], in 1942; his father was then an officer in the US Army Air Corps. He grew up in Vermont, northeastern Kentucky and (for the longest stretch) Indiana, where he went to high school and college. He moved to New York City after college to make movies, and did find work in documentary films, an occupation he still pursues. He published his first novel (''The Deep'') in 1975, and his twelfth (''Ka: Dar Oakley in the Ruin of Ymr'') in 2017. Since 1993 he has taught creative writing at [[Yale University]].<ref name=yale/> In 1992 he received the Award in Literature from the [[American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters]].

His first published novels were science fiction: ''[[The Deep (John Crowley)|The Deep]]'' (1975) and ''[[Beasts (John Crowley)|Beasts]]'' (1976). ''[[Engine Summer]]'' (1979) was nominated for the 1980 [[National Book Award|American Book Award]]<!-- National Book Awards were called "American" for several years from 1980, but must not be confused with [[American Book Awards]]--> in a [[List of winners of the National Book Award#Miscellaneous 1980 to 1985|one-year category Science Fiction]];<ref name=nba1980>

it appears in [[David Pringle]]'s ''[[Science Fiction: The 100 Best Novels]]''.  In 1981 came ''[[Little, Big]]'', covered in Pringle's sequel, ''[[Modern Fantasy: The 100 Best Novels]]''.

In 1987 Crowley embarked on an ambitious four-volume novel, ''[[Ægypt]]'', comprising ''[[The Solitudes (novel)|The Solitudes]]'' (originally published as ''[[The Solitudes (novel)|Ægypt]]''), ''[[Love & Sleep]]'',  ''[[Dæmonomania]],'' and ''[[Endless Things]]'', published in May 2007. This series and ''Little, Big'' were cited when Crowley received the prestigious [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] Award for Literature.

He is also the recipient of an [[Ingram Merrill Foundation]] grant. [[James Merrill]], the organization's founder, greatly loved ''Little, Big'',<ref>{{cite book |last=Bloom |first=Harold |author-link=Harold Bloom |editor1-last=Turner |editor1-first=Alice K. |editor2-last=Andre-Driussi |editor2-first=Michael |title=Snake's-Hands: The Fiction of John Crowley |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JsaIP2n6xvgC |year=2003 |publisher=Cosmos Books |location=[Canton, OH] |isbn=1-58715-509-5 |page=10 |chapter=Preface to ''Snake's-Hands'' |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JsaIP2n6xvgC&pg=PA9}}</ref> and was [[blurb]]ed praising Crowley on the first edition of ''[[Love & Sleep]]''. His recent novels are ''The Translator'', recipient of the Premio Flaiano (Italy); ''Lord Byron’s Novel: The Evening Land'', which contains an entire imaginary novel by the poet; and the aforementioned ''[[Four Freedoms (novel)|Four Freedoms]]'', about workers at an Oklahoma defense plant during World War II. A novella, ''The Girlhood of Shakespeare's Heroines'', appeared in 2002.  A museum-quality 25th anniversary edition of ''Little, Big'', featuring the art of [[Peter Milton]] and a critical introduction by Harold Bloom, is in preparation.

Crowley's short fiction is collected in three volumes: ''Novelty'' (containing the World Fantasy Award-winning novella ''[[Great Work of Time]]''), ''Antiquities'', and ''Novelties & Souvenirs'', an omnibus volume containing nearly all his short fiction through its publication in 2004. A collection of essays and reviews entitled ''In Other Words'' was published in early 2007.

Most of the ideas he has for books occur about ten years before he actually starts working on the books.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSWZ1lakcNY&t=150s John Crowley Interview]</ref>

In 1989 Crowley and his wife Laurie Block founded [[Straight Ahead Pictures]] to produce media (film, video, radio and internet) on American history and culture. Crowley has written scripts for short films and documentaries, many historical documentaries for public television; his work has received numerous awards and has been shown at the New York Film Festival, the [[Berlin Film Festival]], and many others. His scripts include ''The World of Tomorrow'' (on the 1939 [[World's Fair]]), ''No Place to Hide'' (on the bomb shelter obsession), ''The Hindenburg'' (for HBO), and ''FIT: Episodes in the History of the Body'' (American [[physical fitness|fitness]] practices and beliefs over the decades; with Laurie Block).<ref name=yale>[http://english.yale.edu/faculty-staff/john-crowley "John Crowley: Senior Lecturer in English, Creative Writing"] (faculty profile). Yale University: English. Retrieved 2012-03-14.</ref>

Crowley's correspondence with literary critic Harold Bloom, and their mutual appreciation, led in 1993 to Crowley taking up a post at [[Yale University]], where he teaches courses in [[Utopian fiction]], fiction writing, and screenplay writing.  Bloom claimed on Contentville.com that ''Little, Big'' ranks among the five best novels by a living writer, and included ''Little, Big'', ''Ægypt'' (''The Solitudes''), and ''Love & Sleep'' in his canon of literature (in the appendix to ''The Western Canon'', 1994). In his Preface to ''Snake's-Hands'', Bloom identifies Crowley as his "favorite contemporary writer", and the ''Ægypt'' series as his "favorite romance...after ''Little, Big''".

Crowley has also taught at the [[Clarion West Writers Workshop|Clarion West Writers' Workshop]] held annually in Seattle, Washington.
