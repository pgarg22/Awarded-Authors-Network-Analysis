From 1988 to 1998, Jolly worked in [[New York City]] as a stunt performer and special effects artist, garnering over 160 credits and doubling numerous actors including [[Adrien Brody]], [[Norman Reedus]] and [[Freddie Prinze, Jr.]]

He is a member of the Alliance of Los Angeles Playwrights, the [[WGAw]] Caucus and the [[Dramatists Guild]], and is represented by Brant Rose Agency.

==Writing style==
Jolly writes comedies and realist dramas, but often with heightened language and characters that are self-aware. His dramas sometimes verge into dark territory and even physical violence, but always with an underlying sense of optimism. His characters struggle with the human condition, but frequently use humor to deal with personal problems and their inability to understand or handle their own emotions. This gives Jolly's work an uneasy blend of humor and pathos, where laughter is used to mask deep conflicts. The lightning fast turns from one to the other present an exciting challenge for many actors and directors, and also make monologues from Jolly's plays a favorite at auditions and [[International Thespian Festival]] competitions. He has a reputation as a writer of strong roles for women, and many of his plays involve female-centric story lines (''A Gulag Mouse, Trash, Past Curfew'') or gender reversals where roles traditionally thought of as male are written as female. (''Long Joan Silver'')
