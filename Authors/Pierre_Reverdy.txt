'''Pierre Reverdy''' ({{IPA-fr|ʁəvɛʁdi|lang}}; 13 September 1889 – 17 June 1960) was a French poet whose works were inspired by and subsequently proceeded to influence the provocative art movements of the day, [[Surrealism]], [[Dadaism]] and [[Cubism]]. The loneliness and spiritual apprehension that ran through his poetry appealed to the Surrealist credo. He, though, remained independent of the prevailing "-isms", searching for something beyond their definitions. His writing matured into a mystical mission seeking, as he wrote: "the sublime simplicity of reality."<ref>Retrieved from: www.poetryfoundation.org</ref>

== Early life ==
The son of a winegrower,<ref>Vaughan, Hal, "Sleeping With The Enemy, Coco Chanel's Secret War, Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 24</ref> Reverdy was born in [[Occitania (administrative region)|Occitanie]] (southern  France), in the region of [[Narbonne]], and grew up near the [[Montagne Noire]]. The Reverdy ancestors were stonemasons and sculptors associated with work commissioned for churches. The extant facts of his childhood and early years are few and obscured. Some source material indicates that at the time of Reverdy’s birth, his mother was a married woman whose husband was at the time living in [[Argentina]]. Further, it is believed that Reverdy’s father and mother were not able to marry each other until 1897.<ref>http://www.kickacan.com/pierre{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} reverdy, retrieved August 2, 2012</ref> His father schooled him at home, teaching him to read and write.

== Paris ==
[[File:Pierre Reverdy - Feuille ouverte.jpg|thumb|''Feuille ouverte'' ([[Wall poems in Leiden|wall poem in Leiden]])]]
Reverdy arrived in Paris in October 1910, devoting his early years there to his writing.  It was in Paris, at the artistic enclave centered around the [[Bateau-Lavoir]] in [[Montmartre]] that he met [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Max Jacob]], [[Louis Aragon]], [[André Breton]], [[Philippe Soupault]] and [[Tristan Tzara]]. All would come to admire and champion Reverdy’s poetry.<ref>Vaughan, Hal, "Sleeping With The Enemy, Coco Chanel's Secret War, Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 24</ref> Reverdy published a small volume of poetry in 1915. A second compilation of his work brought out in 1924, ''Les épaves du ciel'', brought him greater recognition. The poems were short, fragmentary, the words an evocation of sharp visuals: the volume was the literary equivalent of the [[Plastic arts]] as practiced by Cubist painters and sculptors.<ref>http://www.poetryfoundation.org, retrieved August 2, 2012</ref> In the first [[Surrealist Manifesto]], André Breton hailed Reverdy as "the greatest poet of the time." Louis Aragon said that for Breton, Soupault, Éluard and himself, Reverdy was "our immediate elder, the exemplary poet."<ref>Reverdy, Pierre, "Selected Poems," Bloodaxe Books, title page</ref> In 1917, together with Max Jacob, Vicente Huidobro and Guillaume Apollinaire, Reverdy founded the influential journal ''Nord-Sud '' ("North-South") which contained many Dadaist and Surrealist contributions. Sixteen issues of ''Nord-Sud'' were published, from 15 March 1917 to 15 October 1918. It is believed Reverdy took his inspiration for the title of his periodical from the subway line, the [[Paris Métro]], which in 1910 instituted a route running from Montmartre to [[Montparnasse]]; it was Reverdy's intention to unite the vitality of these two distinctive city districts.<ref>http://www.killacan.com/pierre{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} reverdy, retrieved August 2, 2012</ref>

By nature, Reverdy was a somber man, whose strong spiritual inclinations led him over time to distance himself from the frenetic world of bohemian Paris. In 1926, in a ritualistic act signifying the renunciation of the material world, he burned many of his manuscripts in front of an assembly of friends. He converted to [[Catholicism]] and retreated with his wife, Henriette, to a small house located in proximity to a [[Benedictine]] abbey at [[Solesmes Abbey|Solesmes]].  Excluding intermittent periods when he visited Paris, Solesmes was his home for the next thirty years where he lived a "quasi-monastic life."<ref>Vaughan, Hal, "Sleeping With The Enemy, Coco Chanel's Secret War, Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 24<</ref>

== Retreat into seclusion  ==
During this time in Solesmes, Reverdy wrote several collections including ''Sources du vent'', ''Ferraille'' and ''Le Chant des morts''. Besides this, Reverdy published two volumes containing critical matter (reflections on literature mingled with aphorisms) entitled ''En vrac'' and ''Le livre de mon bord''.  During the WWII German occupation of France, Reverdy became a partisan in the resistance movement. At the liberation of Paris from Nazi rule, his group of [[French Resistance]] fighters were responsible for the capture and arrest of French traitor and German espionage agent Baron Louis de Vaufreland.<ref>Vaughan, Hal, "Sleeping With The Enemy, Coco Chanel's Secret War, Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 53</ref>

== Personal life ==
One of Reverdy’s most enduring and profound relationships was with the couturier [[Coco Chanel]]. The intense period of their romantic liaison lasted from 1921-1926. Yet after the fire of this initial involvement cooled, they still maintained a deep bond and great friendship, which would continue for some forty years.<ref>Vaughan, Hal, "Sleeping With The Enemy, Coco Chanel's Secret War, Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 23</ref> He had always been both appalled and intrigued by the wealth and excess that comprised Chanel’s social circle. Reverdy had become enamored with American [[jazz]], which had just become a popular craze in Paris, a type of nightlife for which Chanel expressed contempt.<ref>Vaughan, Hal, "Sleeping With The Enemy, Coco Chanel's Secret War, Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 53</ref> Chanel, however, was a necessary catalyst for his poetic output. She bolstered his confidence, supported his creative ability and further helped assuage his financial instability by secretly buying his manuscripts through his publisher.<ref>Vaughan, Hal, "Sleeping With The Enemy, Coco Chanel's Secret War, Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 24</ref>

It is postulated that the legendary maxims attributed to Chanel and published in periodicals were crafted under the mentorship of Reverdy—a collaborative effort. "A review of her correspondence reveals a complete contradiction between the clumsiness of Chanel the letter writer and the talent of Chanel as a composer of maxims…After correcting the handful of aphorisms that Chanel wrote about her métier, Reverdy added to this collection of 'Chanelisms' a series of thoughts of a more general nature, some touching on life and taste, others on allure and love."<ref>Charles-Roux, Edmonde, "Chanel and her World," Hachette-Vendome, 1981, p. 328, {{ISBN|9780865651593}}</ref>

Purportedly, Reverdy was not fully aware of the extent of Chanel’s wartime collaboration with the [[Nazis]]. However, as he subscribed to a belief that women were the weaker, more vulnerable sex, he rationalized that Chanel had been manipulated by men who convinced her to champion German interests. Further, as a staunch Catholic, Reverdy was able to absolve Chanel of her transgressions. Indeed, so strong was his tie to her that in 1960, sensing his death was imminent, he wrote a poem to the woman whom he had loved for the past forty years.<ref>Vaughan, Hal, "Sleeping With The Enemy, Coco Chanel's Secret War, Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 222</ref>

''Dear Coco, here it is''<br />
''The best of my hand'' <br />
''And the best of me''<br />
''I offer it thus to you''<br />
''With my heart''<br />
''With my hand''<br />
''Before heading toward''<br />
''The dark road’s end''<br />
''If condemned''<br />
''If pardoned''<br />
''Know you are loved''

== Death ==
Reverdy died in 1960 at [[Solesmes Abbey|Solesmes]].

== Praise ==
<blockquote>
A glass of papaya juice<br>
and back to work. My heart is in my<br>
pocket, it is Poems by Pierre Reverdy.<br>
—'''[[Frank O'Hara]]''', "A Step Away From Them"<ref>[http://www.americanpoems.com/poets/Frank-OHara/4568 A Step Away From Them - A poem by Frank O'Hara - American Poems<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
"Reverdy's strange landscapes, which combine an intense inwardness with a proliferation of sensual data, bear in them the signs of a continual search for an impossible totality. Almost mystical in their effect, his poems are nevertheless anchored in the minutiae of the everyday world; in their quiet, at times monotone music, the poet seems to evaporate, to vanish into the haunted country he has created. The result is at once beautiful and disquieting as if Reverdy had emptied the space of the poem in order to let the reader inhabit it" —'''[[Paul Auster]]'''<ref>[http://www.bloodaxebooks.com/titlepage.asp?isbn=1852241543 Bloodaxe Books: Title Page > Pierre Reverdy: Selected Poems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527200900/http://www.bloodaxebooks.com/titlepage.asp?isbn=1852241543 |date=2011-05-27 }}</ref>
