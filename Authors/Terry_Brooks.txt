[[File:Terry Brooks by Gage Skidmore.jpg|left|thumb|Brooks at a book signing at the 2017 [[Phoenix Comicon]]]]
Brooks had been a writer since high school, writing mainly in the genres of [[science fiction]], western, fiction, and [[Non-fiction writing|non-fiction]].<ref name="Terry Brooks' Bio"/> One day, in his early college life, he was given a copy of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', which inspired him to write in one genre.<ref name="Terry Brooks' Bio"/> While Tolkien inspired the genre, Brooks stated during his TEDxRainier talk "Why I Write about Elves",<ref name="Why I Write about Elves">{{cite web|last1=Brooks|first1=Terry|title=Why I Write about Elves|url=http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/Why-I-Write-about-Elves-Terry-B|website=tedxtalks.ted.com|access-date=December 14, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019000949/http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/Why-I-Write-about-Elves-Terry-B|archive-date=October 19, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> as well as at the Charlotte Literary Festival that he credits the inspiration of his style of writing to [[William Faulkner]]'s works.<ref name="Why I Write about Elves"/> With this inspiration, he then made his debut in 1977 with ''[[The Sword of Shannara]]''.<ref name="Terry Brooks' Bio"/>

After finishing two sequels to ''The Sword of Shannara'', Brooks moved on to the series which would become known as the ''[[Magic Kingdom of Landover|Landover]]'' novels.<ref name="Terry Brooks' Bio"/> Brooks then wrote a four-book series titled ''[[The Heritage of Shannara]]''.<ref name="Terry Brooks' Bio"/> For the next fourteen years, he wrote more ''Landover'' books, then went on to write ''The Word and Void'' trilogy.  Continuing the ''[[Shannara]]'' series, Brooks wrote the prequel to ''The Sword of Shannara'', titled ''[[First King of Shannara]]''.  He then wrote two series, ''[[The Voyage of the Jerle Shannara]]'' and ''[[High Druid of Shannara]]'' and finished a third, ''[[Genesis of Shannara]]'', a trilogy bridging his ''Word and Void'' and ''Shannara'' series.  The sixth book in the ''Landover'' series, ''[[A Princess of Landover]]'', was released in August 2009. 
Returning to Shannara, a duology, ''[[Legends of Shannara]]'', taking place after the events of ''[[Genesis of Shannara]]'', was written next. The first book, entitled ''[[Bearers of the Black Staff]]'', was released in August 2010 and the second, ''[[The Measure of the Magic]]'', was released in August 2011.
He next completed a trilogy entitled ''[[The Dark Legacy of Shannara]]''. The three books are; ''[[Wards of Faerie]]'' (Feb 2013), ''[[Bloodfire Quest]]'' (June 2013), and ''Witch Wraith'' (Dec 2013). He followed this with the trilogy ''Defenders of Shannara'', which include ''The High Druid's Blade'' (July 2014), ''The Darkling Child'' (June 2015), and ''The Sorcerer's Daughter'' (May 24, 2016).
According to his website, he is currently working on the final and concluding tetralogy of the Shannara series known as ''[[The Fall of Shannara]]''. The first book in the tetralogy is ''[[The Black Elfstone]]'' and was released on June 13, 2017. The second book in the series is ''[[The Skaar Invasion ]]'' released on June 19, 2018. The third book in the series is ''[[The Stiehl Assassin]]'' published on May 28, 2019. The fourth and final book in the tetralogy is ''[[The Last Druid]]'', published on October 20, 2020.

A television series based on the Shannara works, entitled ''[[The Shannara Chronicles]]'', began showing on MTV in January 2016. The show starts with the second book of the original series, ''Elfstones'', as there are strong female roles which did not appear in the first book.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/07/terry-brooks-mtv-is-doing-the-shannara-chronicles.html|title=Terry Brooks: MTV is Doing The Shannara Chronicles Right|website=pastemagazine.com|access-date=May 9, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828103526/https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/07/terry-brooks-mtv-is-doing-the-shannara-chronicles.html|archive-date=August 28, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The second season aired in 2017 on [[Spike TV]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2870369/shannara-chronicles-renewed/|title=MTV Renews The Shannara Chronicles For Second Season|website=mtv.com|access-date=May 9, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106054106/http://www.mtv.com/news/2870369/shannara-chronicles-renewed/|archive-date=November 6, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> On January 16, 2018, it was announced that the series had been cancelled after two seasons.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Petski |first1=Denise |title='The Shannara Chronicles' Canceled After Two Seasons |url=https://deadline.com/2018/01/the-shannara-chronicles-canceled-after-two-seasons-spike-mtv-paramount-network-1202244383/ |website=Deadline |access-date=January 17, 2018 |date=January 17, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117033103/http://deadline.com/2018/01/the-shannara-chronicles-canceled-after-two-seasons-spike-mtv-paramount-network-1202244383/ |archive-date=January 17, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Producers later announced that the series is being shopped to other networks.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Andreeva |first1=Nellie |title='The Shannara Chronicles' Shopped To Other Networks For Season 3 |url=https://deadline.com/2018/01/the-shannara-chronicles-shopped-other-networks-season-3-1202244442/ |website=Deadline |access-date=January 17, 2018 |date=January 17, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117064831/http://deadline.com/2018/01/the-shannara-chronicles-shopped-other-networks-season-3-1202244442/ |archive-date=January 17, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

==Novels versus short stories==
After writing "[[Indomitable (short story)|Indomitable]]", a short story constituting an epilogue to ''[[The Wishsong of Shannara]]'', Terry Brooks declared:

{{quote|I find it much harder to write short stories than long fiction. I feel cramped by the lack of space and the dictates of the form. There is considerable difference in long and short fiction disciplines, and I am not good with the latter. I hope not to have to do many more of them, but you never know. I must have written "Indomitable" anywhere from four to five times, each effort different. Give me a five hundred page sprawl as an assignment any day.<ref name="Writing Q&A">{{cite web | last = Brooks | first = Terry | title = Ask Terry Q&A - Writing | date = 1999–2008 | url = http://www.terrybrooks.net/askterry/writing.html | archive-url = https://archive.today/20120914051957/http://www.terrybrooks.net/askterry/writing.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2012-09-14 | access-date = 2008-09-14 }}</ref>}}
