Mark Blankenship wrote in his review for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'': "Although he apes the themes of everything from ''1984'' to ''Series 7,'' a film about a murderous reality show, Hopkins delivers his dogmatism with heavy-handed arrogance."<ref name="Blankenship" /> A production was presented at the PushPush theater in Decatur, Georgia in 2008,<ref name="Holman_2008">{{cite news |last1=Holman |first1=Curt |title=Theater Review - screwmachine/eyecandy at PushPush Theater |url=https://creativeloafing.com/content-181088-theater-review---screwmachine-eyecandy-at-pushpush |accessdate=10 November 2019 |work=Creative Loafing |date=December 10, 2008}}</ref> and it was performed at the San Francisco Fringe Festival in 2017.<ref name="Janiak_2017">{{cite news |last1=Janiak |first1=Lily |title=A case for the Fringe Festival as central |url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/performance/article/A-case-for-the-Fringe-Festival-as-central-12192223.php |accessdate=10 November 2019 |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=September 12, 2017}}</ref>
