===Later plays===
Following his initial success, Barnes wrote a series of plays offering apocalyptic visions of various periods in history:
* ''[[Leonardo's Last Supper]]'' (1969) portrayed [[Leonardo da Vinci]] as prematurely declared dead, with his subsequent "resurrection" in a filthy charnel-house.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dramaonlinelibrary.com/plays/leonardos-last-supper-iid-125730|title=Leonardo's Last Supper – Drama Online|website=www.dramaonlinelibrary.com}}</ref>
* ''The Bewitched'' (1974), which he produced with the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]], showed the Spanish state attempting to produce an heir for [[Charles II of Spain|Carlos II]], whom Barnes portrayed as being an impotent imbecile.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dramaonlinelibrary.com/playwrights/peter-barnes-iid-12381|title=Barnes, Peter – Drama Online|website=www.dramaonlinelibrary.com}}</ref>
* ''[[Laughter!]]'' (1978) was his most controversial work, a double-bill that jumped from the reign of [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan the Terrible]] to a satire based on the tedious bureaucracy required to sustain [[Auschwitz concentration camp]].<ref name=guardian/>
* ''[[Red Noses]]'' (1985) depicts a sprightly priest, originally played by [[Antony Sher]], who travelled around the [[Bubonic plague|plague]]-affected villages of 14th-century France with a band of fools, known as God's Zanies, offering holy assistance.<ref name=variety>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2004/scene/people-news/peter-barnes-1117907348/|title=Peter Barnes|first1=Matt|last1=Wolf|date=5 July 2004}}</ref> It was for this play that Barnes won his [[Laurence Olivier Award|Olivier award]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://officiallondontheatre.com/olivier-awards/winners/olivier-winners-1985/|title=Olivier Winners 1985|website=Olivier Awards}}</ref>
