==Life==
His father was Luca Del Tura, a shoemaker from [[Arezzo]] in [[Tuscany]], Italy, who abandoned his family to join the militia. The father later returned to Arezzo, finally dying in poverty at the age of 85, unforgiven by his son, who never acknowledged the paternal name, taking ''Aretino'' (that is 'Arretine, from Arezzo') as a surname.

His mother was Margherita, known as Tita, Bonci. Either before or after the abandonment (we do not know which), she entered into a lasting relationship with a local noble, Luigi Bacci, who supported Tita, Pietro and his two sisters and brought up Pietro as part of his own family.<ref name=treccani>{{Citation

Aretino spent a formative decade in Perugia, before being sent, highly recommended, to Rome. There [[Agostino Chigi]], the rich banker and patron of [[Raphael]], took him under his wing.

When [[Hanno (elephant)|Hanno the elephant]], pet of [[Pope Leo X]], died in 1516, Aretino penned a satirical pamphlet entitled "The Last Will and Testament of the Elephant Hanno". The fictitious will cleverly mocked the leading political and religious figures of Rome at the time, including Pope Leo X himself. The pamphlet was such a success that it started Aretino's career and established him as a famous satirist, ultimately known as "the Scourge of Princes".

Aretino prospered, living from hand to mouth as a hanger-on in the literate circle of his patron, sharpening his satirical talents on the gossip of politics and the [[Roman Curia|Papal Curia]], and turning the coarse Roman [[pasquinade]] into a rapier weapon of satire, until his sixteen ribald ''Sonetti Lussuriosi'' (Lust Sonnets) written to accompany [[Giulio Romano]]'s exquisitely beautiful but utterly pornographic series of drawings engraved by [[Marcantonio Raimondi]] under the title ''[[I Modi]]'' finally caused such outrage that he had to temporarily flee Rome.

After Leo's death in 1521, his patron was [[Cardinal Giulio de' Medici]], whose competitors for the papal throne felt the sting of Aretino's scurrilous lash. The installation of the Dutch pope [[Adrian VI]] ("la tedesca tigna" in Pietro's words) instead encouraged Aretino to seek new patrons away from Rome, mainly with [[Federico II Gonzaga]] in [[Mantua]], and with the [[condottieri|condottiero]] [[Giovanni dalle Bande Nere|Giovanni de' Medici]] ("Giovanni delle Bande Nere"). The election of his old Medici patron as [[Pope Clement VII]] sent him briefly back to Rome, but death threats and an attempted assassination from one of the victims of his pen, [[Giovanni Giberti|Bishop Giovanni Giberti]], in July 1525,<ref>A member "of Giberti's household, Achille della Volta, attacked Aretino in the street at two o'clock in the morning (1525), stabbed him twice in the chest, and so severely in the right hand that two fingers had to be cut off." Will Durant, ''The Renaissance: [[The Story of Civilization]]'', vol.  5, ch. XXII (1953)[https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Renaissance/XvWpHsfKVoMC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=pietro+aretino+fingers+cut+off&pg=PT543&printsec=frontcover]</ref> set him wandering through northern Italy in the service of various noblemen, distinguished by his wit, audacity and brilliant and facile talents, until he settled permanently in 1527, in [[Venice]], ''the'' anti-Papal city of Italy, "seat of all vices", Aretino noted with gusto.

[[Image:Pietro Aretino, por Tiziano.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Portrait of Pietro Aretino]]'', by [[Titian]], 1545 ([[Palazzo Pitti]])]]

He was a lover of men, having declared himself "a sodomite" since birth. In a letter to Giovanni de' Medici written in 1524 Aretino enclosed a satirical poem saying that due to a sudden aberration he had "fallen in love with a female cook and temporarily switched from boys to girls..." (''My Dear Boy'').<ref>In ''Titian's Pietro Aretino'' (The Frick Collection, 2020, p. 27), Xavier Salomon writes that Aretino's "sexual excesses [were] directed in equal measure toward women and men.... The young targets of his interests became known as the 'Aretine' and the 'Aretini' (the Aretino girls and the Aretino boys)."</ref>  In his comedy ''Il marescalco'', the lead man is overjoyed to discover that the woman he has been forced to marry is really a page boy in disguise. While at court in Mantua he developed a crush on a young man called Bianchino, and annoyed Duke Federico with a request to plead with the boy on the writer's behalf.<ref>Sheila Hale, ''Titian: His Life'' (HarperCollins, 2012), p. 241.</ref>

Safe in Venice, Aretino became a blackmailer, extorting money from men who had sought his guidance in vice. He "kept all that was famous in Italy in a kind of state of siege",<ref>{{cite book |last1=Burckhardt |first1=Jacob |title=The Civilization Of The Renaissance in Italy |date=1878 |publisher=Vienna Phaidon Press |location=University of Toronto - Robarts Library |page=[https://archive.org/details/civilizationofre00burc/page/86 86] |url=https://archive.org/details/civilizationofre00burc |access-date=28 February 2019}}</ref> in [[Jakob Burckhardt]]'s estimation. [[Francis I of France]] and [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] pensioned him at the same time, each hoping for some damage to the reputation of the other. "The rest of his relations with the great is mere beggary and vulgar extortion", according to Burckhardt. Addison states that "he laid half Europe under contribution".<ref>[http://www2.scc.rutgers.edu/spectator/text/march1711/no23.html Spectator 203], March 27, 1711.</ref>

Aretino is said to have died of suffocation from "[[Death from laughter|laughing too much]]".<ref>{{cite book|last=Waterfield|first=Gordon, ed. |title=First Footsteps in East Africa'', by [[Richard F. Burton]]''|location=New York|publisher=Praeger Publishers|year=1966|page=59, footnote}}</ref> The more mundane truth may be that he died from a stroke or heart attack.<ref>Xavier Salomon, ''Titian's Pietro Aretino'' (2020), p.&nbsp;58.</ref>

==Writings==

{{quote|His literary talent, his clear and sparkling style, his varied observation of men and things, would have made him a considerable writer under any circumstances, destitute as he was of the power of conceiving a genuine work of art, such as a true dramatic comedy; and to the coarsest as well as the most refined malice he added a grotesque wit so brilliant that in some cases it does not fall short of that of Rabelais.|[[Jacob Burckhardt]], ''[[The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy]]'', 1855.}}

Apart from both sacred and profane texts—a satire of high-flown [[Renaissance]] [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] [[dialogue]]s is set in a [[brothel]] — and comedies such as ''La cortigiana'' and ''La talenta'', Aretino is remembered above all for his letters, full of literary flattery that could turn to [[blackmail]]. They circulated widely in manuscript and he collected them and published them at intervals winning as many enemies as it did fame, and earned him the dangerous nickname [[Ludovico Ariosto|Ariosto]] gave him: ''flagello dei principi'' ("scourge of princes"). The first English translations of some of Aretino's racier material have been coming onto the market recently.

''La cortigiana'' is a brilliant parody of [[Baldassare Castiglione|Castiglione]]'s ''[[The Book of the Courtier|Il Cortegiano]]'', and features the adventures of a Sienese gentleman, Messer Maco, who travels to Rome to become a [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]. He would also like to win himself a mistress, but when he falls in love with a girl he sees in a window, he realizes that only as a courtier would he be able to win her. In mockery of Castiglione's advice on how to become the perfect courtier, a charlatan proceeds to teach Messer Maco how to behave as a courtier: he must learn how to deceive and flatter, and sit hours in front of the mirror.

==Portrayals by Artists==

Aretino was a close friend of [[Titian]]'s,<ref>"The relationship between the writer and the painter became particularly close over the almost thirty years Aretino spent in Venice." Xavier Salomon, ''Titian's Pietro Aretino'' (2020), p. 38. Aretino became "the closest companion of Titian's life, his most sensitive critic, as well as his adviser, agent, publicist, debt collector, scribe, and hanger-on." Sheila Hale, ''Titian: His Life'' (2012), p. 229.</ref> who painted his [[portrait painting|portrait]] three times: a 1527 portrait in the [[Kunstmuseum Basel]],<ref>[http://sammlungonline.kunstmuseumbasel.ch/eMuseumPlus?service=direct/1/ResultDetailView/result.inline.list.t1.collection_list.$TspTitleLink.link&sp=13&sp=Sartist&sp=SfilterDefinition&sp=0&sp=1&sp=1&sp=SdetailView&sp=23&sp=Sdetail&sp=0&sp=T&sp=0&sp=SdetailList&sp=0&sp=F&sp=Scollection&sp=l274]. In ''Apollo'' magazine (20 September 2019), Frick curator Xavier Salomon makes the case that the portrait in Kunstmuseum Basel is the 1527 portrait of Aretino that Titian painted for the Marquis of Mantua, Frederico Gonzaga.[https://www.apollo-magazine.com/an-important-work-by-titian-has-been-hiding-in-plain-sight/] Subsequently, the museum attributed it to Titian.</ref> a 1537 portrait in the [[Frick Collection]],<ref>[https://collections.frick.org/objects/263/pietro-aretino;jsessionid=ED1281363A37168148B4BA6DDF169192?ctx=87fe45d9-e4cf-4e45-b8be-88d5cda414e7&idx=1]</ref> and a 1545 [[portrait of Pietro Aretino|portrait in the Pitti Palace]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uffizi.it/en/artworks/portrait-of-pietro-aretino|title = Portrait of Pietro Aretino painted by Titian in 1545 &#124; Artworks &#124; Uffizi Galleries}}</ref> Luba Freedman cites a fourth portrait, from "not later than 1535," but [[Xavier F. Salomon]], chief curator at the [[Frick Collection]], writes that "there is no evidence that it ever existed."<ref>In ''Titian's Portraits Through Aretino's Lens'' (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1995), p. 36, Freedman writes: "The four recorded portraits of Aretino by Titian were painted for (1) the Marquis of Mantua, Federico Gonzaga, in 1527; (2) the Cardinal Ippolito de' Medici, not later than 1535 (the year he was poisoned); (3) the Venetian publisher Francesco Marcolini, most probably in 1537; (4) the Duke of Florence, Cosimo I de’ Medici, in 1545." In ''Titian's Pietro Aretino'' (2020), p. 45, however, Xavier Salomon writes that "there is no evidence that it [the portrait for Cardinal Ippolito de' Medici] ever existed."</ref> Titian also portrayed Aretino as [[Pontius Pilate]] in his painting "Ecce Homo,"<ref>Ecce Homo [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tiziano_Vecellio,_called_Titian_-_Ecce_Homo_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg] Not to be confused with [[Ecce Homo (Titian)]].</ref> in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]], [[Vienna]],<ref>Sheila Hale, ''Titian: His Life'' (2012), p. 433; Luba Freedman, ''Titian's Portraits Through Aretino's Lens,'' p. 36. (Freedman refers to the painting as "Pilate Presents Jesus Christ Before the People.")</ref> "as a nameless soldier in the crowd" in "[[Alfonso d'Avalos Addressing his Troops]]," in the [[Prado]], [[Madrid]],<ref>Luba Freedman, ''Titian's Portraits Through Aretino's Lens'', p. 36, which refers to the painting as "Allocution of Alfonso d'Avalos, Marchese del Vasto."</ref> and next to a self-portrait in "[[La Gloria (Titian)|La Gloria]]," also in the Prado.<ref>At the Museo del Prado website, under "Collection," the discussion of "La Gloria" states, "On a lower level are two elderly bearded men identified as Pietro Aretino and Titian himself in profile."[https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/art-work/the-glory/66149817-6f88-4e5f-a09a-81f63a84d145] However, Xavier Salomon writes, "[O]ften in art history things get repeated over and over again and become 'facts'. There is no reason for Aretino to be in Titian’s Gloria and the man usually identified as Aretino barely looks like him. I am absolutely convinced it is not him."
</ref> Clement VII made Aretino a [[Knights Hospitaller|Knight of Rhodes]], and [[Julius III]] named him a Knight of St. Peter, but the chain he wears for his 1545 portrait may have merely been jewelry. In his strictly-for-publication letters to patrons Aretino would often add a verbal portrait to Titian's painted one.

Titian was far from the only artist who portrayed Aretino. "Probably no other celebrity of the [[cinquecento]] had his image reproduced so often and in so many media: paintings, frescoes, sculptures, prints, medals.... At various stages of his life Aretino was also portrayed by [[Sebastiano del Piombo]], [[Alessandro Moretto]], [[Francesco de' Rossi|Francesco Salviati]], [[Jacopo Tintoretto]], and [[Giorgio Vasari]]. His portrait was engraved by [[Marcantonio Raimondi]] and [[Giovanni Jacopo Caraglio]]. His likeness was reproduced on medals by [[Leone Leoni]], Francesco Segala, [[Alfonso Lombardi]], and [[Alessandro Vittoria]] and his image was sculpted by [[Jacopo Sansovino]] and [[Danese Cattaneo]]."<ref>Luba Freedman, ''Titian's Portraits Through Aretino's Lens'', p. 35.</ref>

==The Last Judgment==

In November 1545, Aretino wrote an open letter to Michelangelo criticizing the nudity in ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgment]]''. His dialogues ''La Nanna'', Aretino wrote, "demonstrate the superiority of my reserve to your indiscretion, seeing that I, while handling themes lascivious and immodest, use language comely and decorous, speak in terms beyond reproach and inoffensive to chaste ears. You, on the contrary, presenting so awful a subject, exhibit saints and angels, these without earthly decency, and those without celestial honors…. Your art would be at home in some voluptuous [[bagnio]], certainly not in the highest chapel in the world…. I do not write this out of any resentment for the things I begged of you. In truth, if you had sent me what you promised, you would only have been doing what you ought to have desired most eagerly to do in your own interest…."<ref>John Addington Symonds, ''The Life of Michelangelo Buonarroti'' (The Modern Library, Random House, 1927), pp. 334, 335 (originally published by John C. Nimmo, 1893).</ref> [[John Addington Symonds]] writes, "Aretino’s real object was to wheedle some priceless sketch or drawing out of the great master. This appears from a second letter written by him on the 20th of January 1538."<ref>John Addington Symonds, ''The Life of Michelangelo Buonarroti'' (The Modern Library, Random House, 1927), p.&nbsp;332.</ref>
[[File:Anonimo, medaglia di pietro aretino, 1525-75 ca. (bargello).jpg|thumb|Anonymous joke medal of Aretino with phalluses, before 1575]]

Symonds describes Michelangelo’s answer to Aretino’s November 1545 letter: "Under the form of elaborate compliment it conceals the scorn he must have conceived for Aretino and his insolent advice. Yet he knew how dangerous the man could be, and felt obliged to humour him."<ref>John Addington Symonds, ''The Life of Michelangelo Buonarroti'' (The Modern Library, Random House, 1927), p.&nbsp;332.</ref> In Michelangelo’s ''The Last Judgment'', completed in 1541, he had painted Saint Bartholomew displaying his own flayed skin. "[T]he sagging flayed skin … many scholars believe depicts Michelangelo’s own features. Interestingly, the face of Saint Bartholomew [who is holding the skin] is similar to the face of Pietro Aretino, one of Michelangelo’s chief persecutors."<ref>James A. Connor, ''The Last Judgment: Michelangelo and the Death of the Renaissance'' (Palgrave MacMillan, 2009), p.&nbsp;140.</ref> Bernadine Barnes writes that "no sixteenth-century critic noticed [that the flayed skin represents Michelangelo]. Nor did any contemporary critic notice the portrait of Pietro Aretino in the fresco.... [V]iewers of our own time have often seen him as St Bartholomew, who brandishes a knife in one hand and holds the skin with the semblance of Michelangelo's face in the other. However, Aretino's criticism [of Michelangelo] was not written until 1545, four years after the fresco was completed. Even Aretino's good friend Vasari did not recognize him."<ref>Bernadine Barnes, ''Michelangelo and the Viewer in His Times'' (Reaktion Books, 2017), p.&nbsp;141.</ref>

==Legacy==

Aretino is frequently mentioned in English works of the Elizabethan and later periods and differently appreciated, in comments ranging from "It was one of the wittiest knaves that ever God made" of [[Thomas Nashe|Nashe]] (''[[The Unfortunate Traveller]]'') to "that notorious ribald of Arezzo" of [[John Milton|Milton]] (''[[Areopagitica]]'').<ref>The Oxford Companion to English Literature, 6th edition, ed. [[Margaret Drabble]] (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2000), p.&nbsp;39.</ref>

The English traveller [[Sir John Reresby, 2nd Baronet|Sir John Reresby]] visited "the obscene profane poet" Aretino's grave in the church of [[San Luca, Venice]], in the mid-1650s. He relates that the following epitaph had been removed by the [[Inquisition|inquisitors]]: "''Qui jace Aretin, poeta Tusco, qui dice mal d'ogni uno fuora di Dio; scusandosi dicendo, Io no'l cognosco."'' This he translates as "Here Aretin, the Tuscan poet, lies, who all the world abused but God, and why? he said he knew him not."<ref>Albert Ivatt, M. A., ed., ''The Memoir and Travels of Sir John Reresby, Bart.'' (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner, 1904), p.&nbsp;60.</ref>

However, the epitaph, in [[hendecasyllable]]s a maiore, was a sarcastic one, attributed to Catholic Bishop [[Paolo Giovio]], composed when Aretino was still alive:<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=7WX8bTsz0NcC&dq=%22Di%20tutti%20disse%20mal%20fuorch%C3%A9%20di%20Cristo%22&pg=PA188#v=onepage&q=%22Di%20tutti%20disse%20mal%20fuorch%C3%A9%20di%20Cristo%22&f=false Francesco Domenico Guerrazzi], ''Scritti'', Le Monnier, 1848, p.&nbsp;188).</ref>
<blockquote lang="it"><poem>
''Qui giace l'Aretin, poeta tosco:''
''Di tutti disse mal fuorché di Cristo,''
''Scusandosi col dir: non lo conosco''.
</poem></blockquote>

In 2007, the composer [[Michael Nyman]] set some of Aretino's ''Sonetti lussuriosi'' to music under the title ''[[8 Lust Songs: I Sonetti Lussuriosi|8 Lust Songs]]''. Once again, Aretino's texts proved controversial:  at a 2008 performance at [[Cadogan Hall]], London, the printed programs were withdrawn following allegations of obscenity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicalsource.com/db_control/db_news.php?id=993 |title=Classical Music News: The Classical Source News: Michael Nyman Festival Controversy: Classical Music News |publisher=Classicalsource.com |date=9 June 2008 |access-date=26 December 2011}}</ref>
