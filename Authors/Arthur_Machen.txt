'''Arthur Machen''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|æ|k|ən}}; 3 March 1863 – 15 December 1947) was the pen-name of '''Arthur Llewellyn Jones''', a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] author and [[mysticism|mystic]] of the 1890s and early 20th century. He is best known for his influential [[supernatural fiction|supernatural]], [[fantasy fiction|fantasy]], and [[horror fiction]]. His [[novella]] ''[[The Great God Pan]]'' (1890; 1894) has garnered a reputation as a classic of horror, with [[Stephen King]] describing it as "Maybe the best [horror story] in the English language."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://stephenking.com/news/message-from-stephen-msg11.html |title=Self-Interview |author=Stephen King |date=4 September 2008 |work=StephenKing.com |access-date=11 February 2021}}</ref> He is also well known for  "The Bowmen", a short story that was widely read as fact, creating the [[legend]] of the [[Angels of Mons]].

==Biography==

===Early years===
[[File:Caerleon-Arthur Machen's birthplace.JPG|thumb|left|220px|Arthur Machen's birthplace at The Square, High Street, [[Caerleon]]]]
Machen was born Arthur Llewelyn Jones in [[Caerleon]], [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]]. The house of his birth, opposite the Olde Bull Inn in The Square at Caerleon, is adjacent to the Priory Hotel and is today marked with a commemorative [[blue plaque]]. The beautiful landscape of Monmouthshire (which he usually referred to by the name of the medieval Welsh kingdom, [[Kingdom of Gwent|Gwent]]), with its associations of [[Celt]]ic, [[Wales in the Roman Era|Roman]], and [[medieval]] history, made a powerful impression on him, and his love of it is at the heart of many of his works.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

[[File:The Old Rectory, Llanddewi Fach - geograph.org.uk - 1706021.jpg|thumb|220px|The Rectory, Llanddewi Fach—Machen's childhood home]]
Machen was descended from a long line of clergymen, the family having originated in [[Carmarthenshire]].<ref name=net/> In 1864, when Machen was two, his father John Edward Jones, became vicar of the parish of [[Llanddewi Fach]] with [[Llandegveth]], about five miles north of Caerleon, and Machen was brought up at the rectory there.<ref name=Gwent>Hando, F.J., (1944) ''The Pleasant Land of Gwent'' – Chapter Nine, Arthur Machen, R. H. Johns, Newport.</ref> Jones had adopted his wife's maiden name, Machen, to inherit a legacy, legally becoming "Jones-Machen"; his son was baptised under that name and later used a shortened version of his full name, Arthur Machen, as a [[pen name]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Local historian and folklorist [[Fred Hando]] traces Machen's interest in the occult to a volume of ''[[Household Words]]'' in his father's rectory library, in which he read, at the age of eight, an entrancing article on [[alchemy]]. Hando recounts Machen's other early reading:
<blockquote>
He bought De Quincey's ''[[Confessions of an English Opium Eater]]'' at Pontypool Road Railway Station, ''[[The Arabian Nights]]'' at Hereford Railway Station, and borrowed ''[[Don Quixote]]'' from Mrs. Gwyn, of Llanfrechfa Rectory. In his father's library he found also the ''[[Waverley Novels]]'', a three-volume edition of the ''Glossary of Gothic Architecture'', and an early volume of [[Tennyson]].<ref name=Gwent/>
</blockquote>

At the age of eleven, Machen boarded at [[Hereford Cathedral School]], where he received an excellent classical education. Family poverty ruled out attendance at university, and Machen was sent to London, where he sat exams to attend medical school but failed to get in. Machen, however, showed literary promise, publishing in 1881 a long poem "Eleusinia" on the subject of the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]]. Returning to London, he lived in relative poverty, attempting to work as a journalist, as a publisher's clerk, and as a children's tutor while writing in the evening and going on long rambling walks across London. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In 1884 he published his second work, the pastiche ''The Anatomy of Tobacco'', and secured work with the publisher and bookseller [[George Redway]] as a cataloguer and magazine editor. This led to further work as a translator from French, translating the ''[[Heptameron]]'' of [[Marguerite de Navarre]], ''Le Moyen de Parvenir'' (''Fantastic Tales'') of [[Béroalde de Verville]], and the ''[[Histoire de ma vie|Memoirs]]'' of [[Giacomo Casanova|Casanova]]. Machen's translations in a spirited English style became standard ones for many years. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In 1887, the year his father died,<ref name=net>{{cite web|url=http://www.caerleon.net/history/machen/text/page5.html|title=Arthur Machen|publisher=caerleon.net|access-date=26 January 2017}}</ref> Machen married Amelia (Amy) Hogg, an unconventional music teacher with a passion for the theatre, who had literary friends in London's [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] circles. Hogg had introduced Machen to the writer and occultist [[A. E. Waite]], who was to become one of Machen's closest friends. Machen also made the acquaintance of other literary figures, such as [[M. P. Shiel]] and [[Edgar Jepson]]. Soon after his marriage, Machen began to receive a series of legacies from Scottish relatives that allowed him to gradually devote more time to writing.<ref name="machensoc.demon.co.uk">[http://www.machensoc.demon.co.uk/machbiog.html Biography at the ''Friends of Arthur Machen'' website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820152903/http://www.machensoc.demon.co.uk/machbiog.html |date=20 August 2007 }}</ref>

===Literary decadence in the 1890s===

Around 1890 Machen began to publish in literary magazines, writing stories influenced by the works of [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], some of which used [[gothic horror|gothic]] or [[fantasy|fantastic]] themes. This led to his first major success, ''[[The Great God Pan]]''. It was published in 1894 by [[John Lane (publisher)|John Lane]] in the noted Keynotes Series, which was part of the growing [[aesthetic movement]] of the time. Machen's story was widely denounced for its sexual and horrific content and consequently sold well, going into a second edition.

Machen next produced ''[[The Three Impostors]]'', a novel composed of a number of interwoven tales, in 1895. The novel and the stories within it were eventually to be regarded as among Machen's best works. However, following the scandal surrounding [[Oscar Wilde]] later that year, Machen's association with works of decadent horror made it difficult for him to find a publisher for new works. Thus, though he would write some of his greatest works over the next few years, some were published much later. These included ''[[The Hill of Dreams]]'', ''Hieroglyphics'', ''A Fragment of Life'', the story "[[The White People]]", and the stories which make up ''Ornaments in Jade''.<ref name="machensoc.demon.co.uk"/><ref>

===Tragedy and acting: 1899–1910===
In 1899, Machen's wife Amy died of cancer after a long period of illness. This had a devastating effect on Machen. He only gradually recovered from his loss over the next year, partially through his close friendship with [[Arthur Edward Waite|A. E. Waite]]. It was through Waite's influence that Machen joined at this time the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], though Machen's interest in the organization was not lasting or very deep.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shadowplayzine.com/Articles/hermetic_horrors.htm |title=Hermetic Horrors: Weird Fiction Writers and the Golden Dawn |author=Leigh Blackmore |year=1985 |work=Shadowplay |access-date=25 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091109074626/http://shadowplayzine.com/Articles/hermetic_horrors.htm |archive-date=9 November 2009 }}</ref>

[[File:House of Souls 1906.jpg|thumb|200px|''The House of Souls'' (London: Grant Richards, 1906), with cover designs by [[Sidney Sime]]]]
Machen's recovery was further helped by his sudden change of career, becoming an actor in 1901 and a member of [[Frank Benson (actor)|Frank Benson]]'s company of travelling players, a profession which took him round the country.

This led in 1903 to a second marriage, to Dorothie Purefoy Hudleston, which brought Machen much happiness. Machen managed to find a publisher in 1902 for his earlier written work ''Hieroglyphics'', an analysis of the nature of literature, which concluded that true literature must convey "ecstasy". In 1906 Machen's literary career began once more to flourish as the book ''The House of Souls'' collected his most notable works of the nineties and brought them to a new audience. He also published a satirical work, ''Dr Stiggins: His Views and Principles'', generally considered one of his weakest works.<ref>"''Dr Stiggins'' was not read in his day and is unreadable in ours" S.T. Joshi, ''The Weird Tale'' (University of Texas Press 1990), p. 17</ref>

Machen also was at this time investigating [[Celtic Christianity]], the [[Holy Grail]] and [[King Arthur]]. Publishing his views in [[Lord Alfred Douglas]]'s ''The Academy'', for which he wrote regularly, Machen concluded that the legends of the Grail actually were based on dim recollections of the rites of the Celtic Church. These ideas also featured strongly in the novel ''The Secret Glory'' which he wrote at this time, marking the first use in fiction of the idea of the Grail's surviving into modern times in some form, an idea much utilised ever since, as by [[Charles Williams (UK writer)|Charles Williams]] (''War in Heaven''), [[Dan Brown]] (''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'') and [[George Lucas]] (''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]''). In 1907, ''[[The Hill of Dreams]]'', generally considered Machen's masterpiece, was finally published, though it was not recognized much at the time.<ref name="machensoc.demon.co.uk"/>

The next few years saw Machen continue with acting in various companies and with journalistic work, but he was finding it increasingly hard to earn a living and his legacies were long exhausted. Machen was also attending literary gatherings such as the New Bohemians and the [[Square Club (writers)|Square Club]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Simkin |first1=John |title=Arthur Machen |url=http://spartacus-educational.com/FWWmachenA.htm |website=Spartacus Educational |access-date=15 July 2018}}</ref>

===Journalism and the Great War: 1910–1921===
Finally Machen accepted a full-time journalist's job at [[Alfred Harmsworth]]'s ''[[Evening News (London)|Evening News]]'' in 1910. In February 1912 his son Hilary was born, followed by a daughter Janet in 1917. The coming of war in 1914 saw Machen return to public prominence for the first time in twenty years due to the publication of "The Bowmen" and the subsequent publicity surrounding the "[[Angels of Mons]]" episode. He published a series of stories capitalizing on this success, most of which were morale-boosting propaganda, but the most notable, "The Great Return" (1915) and the novella ''The Terror'' (1917), were more accomplished. He also published a series of autobiographical articles during the war, later reprinted in book form as ''Far Off Things''. During the war years Machen also met and championed the work of a fellow Welshman, [[Caradoc Evans]].<ref name="machensoc.demon.co.uk"/>

In general, though, Machen thoroughly disliked work at the newspaper, and it was only the need to earn money for his family which kept him at it. The money came in useful, allowing him to move in 1919 to a bigger house with a garden, in [[St John's Wood]], which became a noted location for literary gatherings attended by friends such as the painter [[Augustus John]], [[D. B. Wyndham Lewis]], and [[Jerome K. Jerome]]. Machen's dismissal from the ''Evening News'' in 1921 came as a relief in one sense, though it caused financial problems. Machen, however, was recognized as a great [[Fleet Street]] character by his contemporaries, and he remained in demand as an essay writer for much of the twenties.

===The Machen boom of the 1920s===
[[File:Secret Glory 1922.jpg|thumb|180px|Cover of the U.S. edition of ''The Secret Glory'' (New York: Knopf, 1922), one of the series of Machen's works published by [[Alfred A. Knopf]] in the 1920s]]
The year 1922 saw a revival in Machen's literary fortunes. ''The Secret Glory'', considered by some to be Machen's final masterpiece,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/oct/30/featuresreviews.guardianreview24|title=Pan's people|first=Richard|last=Stanley|date=29 October 2004|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=26 January 2017}}</ref> was finally published, as was his autobiography ''Far Off Things'', and new editions of Machen's Casanova, ''The House of Souls'' and ''The Hill of Dreams'' all came out. Machen's works had now found a new audience and publishers in America, and a series of requests for republications of books started to come in. [[Vincent Starrett]], [[James Branch Cabell]], and [[Carl Van Vechten]] were American Machen devotees who helped in this process.<ref name="machensoc.demon.co.uk"/>

Another sign of his rising fortunes was the publication in 1923 of a collected edition of his works (the "Caerleon Edition") and a bibliography. That year also saw the publication of a recently completed second volume of autobiography, ''Things Near and Far''—the third and final volume, ''The London Adventure'', being published in 1924. Machen's earlier works suddenly started becoming much-sought-after collectors' items at this time, a position they have held ever since. In 1924 he issued a collection of bad reviews of his own work, with very little commentary, under the title ''Precious Balms''. In this period of prosperity Machen's home saw many visitors and social gatherings, and Machen made new friends, such as [[Oliver Stonor]].

===Final years: 1926–1947===

By 1926 the boom in republication was mostly over, and Machen's income dropped. He continued republishing earlier works in collected editions, as well as writing essays and articles for various magazines and newspapers and contributing forewords and introductions to both his own works and those of other writers—such as the Monmouthshire historian [[Fred Hando]]'s ''The Pleasant Land of Gwent'' (1944)—but produced little new fiction. In 1927, he became a manuscript reader for the publisher [[Ernest Benn]], which brought in a much-needed regular income until 1933.

In 1929, Machen and his family moved away from London to [[Amersham]] in Buckinghamshire, but they still faced financial hardship. He received some recognition for his literary work when he received a Civil List pension of £100 per annum in 1932, but the loss of work from Benn's a year later made things difficult once more. A few more collections of Machen's shorter works were published in the thirties, partially as a result of the championing of Machen by [[John Gawsworth]], who also began work on a biography of Machen that was only published in 2005 thanks to the Friends of Arthur Machen.<ref name="machensoc.demon.co.uk"/>

Machen's financial difficulties were only finally ended by the literary appeal launched in 1943 for his eightieth birthday. The initial names on the appeal show the general recognition of Machen's stature as a distinguished man of letters, as they included [[Max Beerbohm]], [[T. S. Eliot]], [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]], [[Walter de la Mare]], [[Algernon Blackwood]], and [[John Masefield]]. The success of the appeal allowed Machen to live the last few years of his life, until 1947, in relative comfort.

==Views==
===Spiritual===
From the beginning of his literary career, Machen espoused a [[Mysticism|mystical]] belief that the humdrum ordinary world hid a more mysterious and strange world beyond. His gothic and [[decadent]] works of the 1890s concluded that the lifting of this veil could lead to madness, sex, or death, and usually a combination of all three. Machen's later works became somewhat less obviously full of gothic trappings, but for him investigations into mysteries invariably resulted in life-changing transformation and sacrifice. Machen loved the medieval world view because he felt it manifested deep spirituality alongside a rambunctious earthiness.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}

Machen was a great enthusiast for literature that expressed the "rapture, beauty, adoration, wonder, awe, mystery, sense of the unknown, desire for the unknown" that he summed up in the word ''ecstasy''.<ref>Arthur Machen, ''Hieroglyphics'' (London: Grant Richards, 1902), p. 11.</ref> His main passions were for writers and writing he felt achieved this, an idiosyncratic list which included the ''[[Mabinogion]]'' and other [[Romance (heroic literature)|medieval romances]], [[François Rabelais]], [[Miguel de Cervantes]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[Samuel Johnson]], [[Thomas de Quincey]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], and [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]. Those writers who failed to achieve this, or far worse did not even attempt it, received short shrift from Machen.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}

Machen's strong opposition to a materialistic viewpoint is obvious in many of his works, marking him as part of [[neo-romanticism]]. He was deeply suspicious of [[science]], [[materialism]], [[commerce]], and Puritanism, all of which were anathema to Machen's [[Conservatism|conservative]], [[bohemianism|bohemian]], [[mystical]], and ritualistic temperament. Machen's virulent satirical streak against things he disliked has been regarded as a weakness in his work, and rather dating, especially when it comes to the fore in works such as ''Dr Stiggins''. Similarly, some of his propagandistic [[First World War]] stories also have little appeal to a modern audience.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}

Machen, brought up as the son of a [[Church of England]] clergyman, always held Christian beliefs, though accompanied by a fascination with sensual [[mysticism]]; his interests in [[paganism]] and the [[occult]] were especially prominent in his earliest works. Machen was well read on such matters as [[alchemy]], the [[kabbalah]], and [[Hermeticism]], and these occult interests formed part of his close friendship with [[Arthur Edward Waite|A. E. Waite]]. Machen, however, was always very down-to-earth, requiring substantial proof that a [[supernatural]] event had occurred, and was thus highly sceptical of [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualism]]. Unlike many of his contemporaries, such as Oscar Wilde and Alfred Douglas, his disapproval of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and his admiration for the medieval world and its [[Roman Catholic]] ritualism did not fully tempt him away from [[Anglicanism]]—though he never fitted comfortably into the Victorian [[Anglo-Catholic]] world.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}

The death of his first wife led him to a spiritual crossroads, and he experienced a series of mystical events. After his experimentation with the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], the orthodox ritual of the Church became ever more important to him, gradually defining his position as a [[High Church]] Anglican who was able to incorporate elements from his own mystical experiences, [[Celtic Christianity]], and readings in literature and legend into his thinking.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}

===Political===
In politics, Machen was reactionary. He stated in response to a 1937 questionnaire on the [[Spanish Civil War]] in the ''[[Left Review]]'', "Mr. Arthur Machen presents his compliments and begs to inform that he is, and always has been, entirely for [[Francisco Franco|General Franco]]."<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Auden|first1=W.

== Legacy and influence ==
Machen's literary significance is substantial; his stories have been translated into many languages and reprinted in short story anthologies countless times. In the sixties, a paperback reprint in the [[Ballantine Adult Fantasy series]] brought him to the notice of a new generation. More recently, the [[small press]] has continued to keep Machen's work in print. In 2010, to mark the 150 years since Machen's birth, two volumes of Machen's work were republished in the prestigious [[Parthian Books#Library of Wales|Library of Wales]] series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/9473709.Tracing_the_life_of_Caerleon_mystic__Arthur_Machen/|title=Tracing the life of Caerleon mystic, Arthur Machen|publisher=southwalesargus.co.uk|access-date=26 January 2017}}</ref>

Literary critics such as [[Wesley D. Sweetser]] and [[S. T. Joshi]] see Machen's works as a significant part of the late Victorian revival of the [[gothic novel]] and the decadent movement of the 1890s, bearing direct comparison to the themes found in contemporary works like Robert Louis Stevenson's ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'', [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'', and Oscar Wilde's ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]''. At the time authors like Wilde, [[William Butler Yeats]], and [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] were all admirers of Machen's works. He is also usually noted in the better studies of [[Anglo-Welsh literature]]. The French writer [[Paul-Jean Toulet]] translated Machen's ''[[The Great God Pan]]'' into French and visited Machen in London. [[Charles Williams (British writer)|Charles Williams]] was also a devotee of Machen's work, which inspired Williams' own fiction.<ref>[[Glen Cavaliero]], ''Charles Williams: Poet of Theology'' (London, Macmillan, 1983) p. 55.</ref>

Historian of fantastic literature [[Brian Stableford]] has suggested that Machen "was the first writer of authentically modern horror stories, and his best works must still be reckoned among the finest products of the genre".<ref name="bs">"Machen, Arthur (Llewellyn)", by Brian Stableford in [[David Pringle]] (ed), ''St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost and Gothic Writers''. London : St. James Press, 1998, {{ISBN|1558622063}} (pp. 382–84).</ref>

===Genre fiction===
Machen's popularity in 1920s America has been noted, and his work was an influence on the development of the pulp horror found in magazines like ''[[Weird Tales]]'' and on such notable fantasy writers as [[James Branch Cabell]], [[Clark Ashton Smith]], [[Robert E. Howard]],<ref>Rusty Burke notes that Howard's early story "The Little People" is "clearly influenced by Arthur Machen's 'The Shining Pyramid'" (Rusty Burke, "Notes on Miscellanea" in Robert E. Howard, ''Bran Mak Morn: The Last King ''. New York: Del Rey/Ballantine, p. 193. {{ISBN|978-0-345-46154-4}}).</ref> [[Frank Belknap Long]] (who wrote a tribute to Machen in verse, "On Reading Arthur Machen"),<ref>Long's poem is republished in Lovecraft's ''Supernatural Horror in Literature''.

C. Vivian|E. Charles Vivian]].<ref>"Vivian, E(velyn) C(harles)", by [[Jack Adrian]] in the ''St. James Guide To Fantasy Writers'', edited by David Pringle. St. James Press, 1996, pp. 577–80 {{ISBN|1-55862-205-5}}</ref>

His significance was recognized by [[H. P. Lovecraft]], who in his essay "[[Supernatural Horror in Literature]]" named Machen as one of the four "modern masters" of supernatural horror (with [[Algernon Blackwood]], [[Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron Dunsany|Lord Dunsany]], and [[M. R. James]]). Machen's influence on Lovecraft's own work was substantial. Lovecraft's reading of Machen in the early 1920s led him away from his earlier Dunsanian writing towards the development of what became the [[Cthulhu Mythos]]. Machen's use of a contemporary Welsh or London background in which sinister ancient horrors lurk and are capable of interbreeding with modern people obviously helped inspire Lovecraft's similar use of a New England background. Machen's story "[[The White People]]" includes references to curious unknown rites and beings, an idea Lovecraft uses frequently in the mythos.

Lovecraft pays tribute to the influence by directly incorporating some of Machen's creations and references, such as [[Nodens (Cthulhu Mythos)|Nodens]] and [[Aklo]], into his Cthulhu Mythos and using similar plotlines, most notably seen by a comparison of "[[The Dunwich Horror]]" to ''[[The Great God Pan]]'' and of "[[The Whisperer in Darkness]]" to "[[The Novel of the Black Seal]]". Other Lovecraft tales with a debt or reference to Machen include "[[The Call of Cthulhu]]", "[[The Festival (short story)|The Festival]]", "[[Cool Air]]", "[[The Descendant (short story)|The Descendant]]", and "[[The Colour Out of Space]]".{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

His intense, atmospheric stories of horror and the supernatural have been read and enjoyed by many modern horror and fantasy writers, influencing directly [[Peter Straub]], [[Stephen King]], [[Ramsey Campbell]], [[Karl Edward Wagner]],<ref>Benjamin Szumskyj, ''Black Prometheus: A Critical Study of Karl Edward Wagner'', Gothic Press, 2007 (p. 21)<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed, if any --></ref> "[[Sarban (author)|Sarban]]" (John William Wall),<ref>[[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Peter Nicholls]],"Sarban", in ''Supernatural Fiction Writers'' edited by E.

===Wider literary influence===
Machen's influence is not limited to genre fiction, however. [[Jorge Luis Borges]] recognized Machen as a great writer, and through him Machen has had an influence on [[magic realism]]. He was also a major influence on [[Paul Bowles]] and [[Javier Marías]], the latter of whom dedicated a subplot of his 1989 novel ''All Souls'' to collecting the works of Machen and his circle of peers. He was one of the most significant figures in the life of the [[Poet Laureate]] Sir [[John Betjeman]], who attributed to Machen his conversion to High Church Anglicanism, an important part of his philosophy and poetry. [[Sylvia Townsend Warner]] (a niece of Machen's second wife, Purefoy) admired Machen and was influenced by him,<ref name="Gwilym Games 2007"/> as is his great-granddaughter, the contemporary artist [[Tessa Farmer]].<ref>{{cite journal |year=2007 |title=In Conversation With Tessa Farmer |journal=Antennae |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=16–24 |url=http://www.antennae.org.uk/ANTENNAE%20ISSUE%203%20V1.doc.pdf |access-date=2007-10-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228011524/http://www.antennae.org.uk/ANTENNAE%20ISSUE%203%20V1.doc.pdf |archive-date=28 February 2008 }}</ref>

Machen was also a pioneer in [[psychogeography]], due to his interest in the interconnection between landscape and the mind. His strange wanderings in Wales and London recorded in his beautiful prose make him of great interest to writers on this subject, especially those focusing on London, such as [[Iain Sinclair]] and [[Peter Ackroyd]]. [[Alan Moore]] wrote an exploration of Machen's mystical experiences in his work ''[[A Disease of Language|Snakes and Ladders]]''. [[Aleister Crowley]] loved Machen's works, feeling they contained "Magickal" truth, and put them on the reading list for his students, though Machen, who never met him, detested Crowley. Other occultists, such as [[Kenneth Grant]], also find Machen an inspiration. Far closer to Machen's personal mystical world view was his effect on his friend [[Evelyn Underhill]], who reflected some of Machen's thinking in her highly influential book ''Mysticism''.

One chapter of the French best-seller ''[[The Morning of the Magicians]]'', by L. Pauwels and J. Berger (1960), deals extensively with Machen's thought and works. Machen's approach to reality is described as an example of the "fantastic realism" which the book is dedicated to.

In music, the composer [[John Ireland (composer)|John Ireland]] found Machen's works to be a life-changing experience that directly influenced much of his composition. [[Mark E. Smith]] of [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]] also found Machen an inspiration. Likewise, [[Current 93]] have drawn on the mystical and occult leanings of Machen, with songs such as "The Inmost Light", which shares its title with Machen's story. Some artists on the [[Ghost Box Music]] label like [[Belbury Poly]] and [[The Focus Group]] draw heavily on Machen. It is an interest also shared by film directors like Mexican [[Rogelio A. González]] who made a successful version of "The Islington Mystery" as ''[[El Esqueleto de la señora Morales]]'' (1960), adapted by [[Luis Alcoriza]], a frequent collaborator in [[Luis Buñuel]]'s classic films. This interest in Machen's works among filmmakers is also shared by [[Guillermo del Toro]] and [[Richard Stanley (film director)|Richard Stanley]]. Other notable figures with an enthusiasm for Machen have included [[Brocard Sewell]], [[Barry Humphries]], [[Stewart Lee]] and [[Rowan Williams]], Archbishop of Canterbury.<ref name="Gwilym Games 2007"/>

An Arthur Machen Society was established in 1948 in the United States and survived until the 1960s. It was followed by the Arthur Machen Society based in the UK, in 1986, which in turn was replaced by the current literary society, The Friends of Arthur Machen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arthurmachen.org.uk/|title=Friends of Arthur Machen Website homepage: Horror Fantastic and Supernatural Fiction|publisher=arthurmachen.org.uk|access-date=27 September 2014}}</ref>

The Friends of Arthur Machen (FoAM) is a non-profit international [[literary society]] founded in 1998 dedicated to supporting interest in Arthur Machen and his work, and to aid research. It publishes two journals: ''Faunus'', which reprints rare Machen articles and criticism of his work, and ''Machenalia''. It fosters interest not only in Machen but in events in which he played a key part, such as the [[Angels of Mons]] affair, and organises [[psychogeography|psychogeographic]] excursions.

Prominent members include [[Javier Marías]], [[Stewart Lee]] and [[R.B. Russell]] of [[Tartarus Press]]. The society was nominated for a [[World Fantasy Special Award: Non-Professional]] in 2006.
