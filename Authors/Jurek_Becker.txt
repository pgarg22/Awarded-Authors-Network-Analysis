'''Jurek Becker''' ({{IPA-de|ˈjuː.ʁɛk ˈbɛ.kɐ|lang|De-Jurek Becker.ogg}}, probably 30 September 1937 – 14 March 1997) was a Polish-born German writer, screenwriter and [[East Germany|East German]] dissident. His most famous novel is ''[[Jacob the Liar]]'', which has been made into two films. He lived in [[Łódź]] during [[World War II]] for about two years and survived the [[Holocaust]].

==Childhood==
Jurek Becker was born, probably, in 1937. His birth date is not entirely clear because his father gave a birth date that was intended to protect the child from deportation. After the war Becker was claimed by a father, but Jurek was never sure if he was his real father,<ref name=SanderGilman>{{cite web|url=http://www.new-books-in-german.com/featur28.htm|title=A Rare Bird Sander Gilman on writing the biography of Jurek Becker|author=Sander Gilman|date=2002|access-date=October 5, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040515142803/http://www.new-books-in-german.com/featur28.htm|archive-date=May 15, 2004|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and who said he no longer remembered Jurek's correct birth date. It is probable that Jurek Becker was some years younger than is generally reckoned.

He lived in the [[Łódź Ghetto]] as a child. When he was five, he was sent to the [[Ravensbrück concentration camp]] and later to [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]]. His mother was murdered in the [[Holocaust]], but his father survived; father and son were reunited after the war and settled together in [[East Berlin]].

==Career==
After completing his national service in the East German army in the 1950s, during which time he became firm friends with the actor [[Manfred Krug]], Becker studied philosophy in [[East Berlin]] but was expelled for expressing non-conformist views. In the 1960s he wrote film scripts, one of which, ''Jakob der Lügner'' ("Jacob the Liar"), he turned into a novel when the film production was halted. It was [[Jacob the Liar (1975 film)|made into a film]] by the East German film company [[DEFA]] in 1974, and in 1975 became the only East German film ever to be nominated for an [[Academy Award]] (in the foreign-language film category), though it did not win. A [[Jakob the Liar|1998 remake]], starring [[Robin Williams]] in the title role, had limited success.

By the mid-1970s differences of opinion with the [[East Germany|GDR]] authorities were becoming apparent, and Becker was one of the original twelve signatories of the petition against the expulsion of writer and singer [[Wolf Biermann]] in November 1976. In 1977 he moved from East to [[West Berlin]], though somewhat unusually he retained his East German citizenship. He continued to publish novels and short stories, some on Jewish themes, others not.

Becker died in 1997 of [[colon cancer]] that was diagnosed in December 1995.
