'''John Boynton Priestley''', [[Order of Merit|OM]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|r|iː|s|t|l|i}}; 13 September 1894 – 14 August 1984) was an English novelist, playwright, screenwriter, broadcaster and social commentator.<ref>{{Cite web|title=J B Priestley|url=https://www.bl.uk/people/j-b-priestley|access-date=13 May 2021|website=The British Library}}</ref>

His [[Yorkshire]] background is reflected in much of his fiction, notably in ''[[The Good Companions]]'' (1929), which first brought him to wide public notice. Many of his plays are structured around a [[time slip]], and he went on to develop a new theory of time, with different dimensions that link past, present and future.

In 1940, he broadcast a series of short [[propaganda]] radio talks that were credited with strengthening civilian morale during the [[Battle of Britain]]. In the following years, his left-wing beliefs brought him into conflict with the government and influenced the development of the [[Welfare state in the United Kingdom|welfare state]].

== Early life ==
Priestley was born on 13 September 1894 at 34 Mannheim Road, [[Manningham, Bradford|Manningham]], which he described as an "extremely respectable" suburb of [[Bradford]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Cook|first=Judith|author-link=Judith Cook|title=Priestley|year=1997|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=London|isbn=0-7475-3508-6|page=5|chapter=Beginnings and Childhood}}</ref> His father Jonathan Priestley (1868–1924) was a headmaster. His mother Emma (''née'' Holt; 1865–1896) died when he was just two years old, and his father remarried four years later.<ref name="konkle">Lincoln Konkle, ''J. B. Priestley'', in British Playwrights, 1880–1956: A Research and Production Sourcebook, by William W. Demastes, Katherine E. Kelly; [[Greenwood Publishing Group|Greenwood Press]], 1996</ref> Priestley was educated at [[Belle Vue Boys' School|Belle Vue Grammar School]], which he left at 16 to work as a junior clerk at Helm & Co., a wool firm in the [[Swan Arcade, Bradford|Swan Arcade]]. During his years at Helm & Co. (1910–1914), he started writing at night and had articles published in local and London newspapers. He was to draw on memories of Bradford in many of the works he wrote after he had moved south, including ''[[Bright Day]]'' and ''[[When We Are Married]]''. As an old man, he deplored the destruction by developers of [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] buildings in Bradford such as the Swan Arcade, where he had his first job.

Priestley served in the British army during the [[First World War]], volunteering for the [[Duke of Wellington's Regiment]] on 7 September 1914, and being posted to the 10th Battalion in France as a Lance-Corporal on 26 August 1915. He was badly wounded in June 1916, when he was buried alive by a trench mortar. He spent many months in military hospitals and convalescent establishments, and on 26 January 1918 was commissioned as an officer in the [[Devonshire Regiment]] and posted back to France late summer 1918. As he describes in his literary reminiscences, ''Margin Released'', he suffered from the effects of poison gas, and then supervised German prisoners of war, before being demobilised in early 1919.

After his military service, Priestley received a university education at [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=16 August 2019|title=JB Priestley, grand old grumbler, dies at 89 – archive, 16 August 1984|url=http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/16/jb-priestley-grand-old-grumbler-dies-1984|access-date=13 May 2021|website=The Guardian|language=en}}</ref> By the age of 30, he had established a reputation as an essayist and critic. His novel ''[[Benighted (novel)|Benighted]]'' (1927) was adapted into the [[James Whale]] film ''[[The Old Dark House (1932 film)|The Old Dark House]]'' (1932); the novel has been published under the film's name in the United States.

== Career ==
Priestley's first major success came with a novel, ''[[The Good Companions]]'' (1929), which earned him the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for fiction and made him a national figure. His next novel, ''[[Angel Pavement]]'' (1930), further established him as a successful novelist. However, some critics were less than complimentary about his work, and Priestley threatened legal action against [[Graham Greene]] for what he took to be a defamatory portrait of him in the novel ''[[Stamboul Train]]'' (1932).

In 1934 he published the travelogue ''[[English Journey]]'', an account of what he saw and heard while travelling through the country in the depths of the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Great Depression]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Marr | first=Andrew | author-link=Andrew Marr | title=A History of Modern Britain | year=2008 | page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofmodernb0000marr/page/ xxii] | publisher=Macmillan | isbn=978-0-330-43983-1 | url=https://archive.org/details/historyofmodernb0000marr/page/ }}</ref>

Priestley is today seen as having a prejudice against the Irish,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/irish-butt-of-english-racism-for-more-than-eight-centuries-1342976.html|title=Irish butt of English racism for more than eight centuries|date=23 October 2011}}</ref><ref name="Fagge2011">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lNpNtZAB0yoC&pg=PA29|title=The Vision of J.B.

I should be interested to hear a speech and read a book or two on the subject of what Ireland has done to England... if we do have an [[Irish Republic]] as our neighbour, and it is found possible to return her exiled citizens, what a grand clearance there will be in all the western ports, from the Clyde to Cardiff, what a fine exit of ignorance and dirt and drunkenness and disease."<ref>J. B. Priestley, ''English Journey'' (London: William Heinemann, 1934), pp. 248-9</ref>

He moved into a new genre and became equally well known as a [[dramatist]]. ''[[Dangerous Corner]]'' (1932) was the first of many plays that would enthral West End theatre audiences. His best-known play is ''[[An Inspector Calls]]'' (1945). His plays are more varied in tone than the novels, several being influenced by [[J. W. Dunne]]'s theory of time, which plays a part in the plots of ''Dangerous Corner'' (1932) and ''[[Time and the Conways]]''.

In 1940, Priestley wrote an essay for ''[[Horizon (magazine)|Horizon]]'' magazine, where he criticised [[George Bernard Shaw]] for his support of [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]: "Shaw presumes that his friend Stalin has everything under control. Well, Stalin may have made special arrangements to see that Shaw comes to no harm, but the rest of us in Western Europe do not feel quite so sure of our fate, especially those of us who do not share Shaw's curious admiration for dictators."<ref>J. B. Priestley, "The War – And After", in ''Horizon'', January 1940. Reprinted in Andrew Sinclair, ''War Decade: An Anthology of the 1940s'', Hamish Hamilton, 1989. {{ISBN|0241125677}} (p. 19).</ref>

During the [[Second World War]], he was a regular broadcaster on the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]]. The ''Postscript'', broadcast on Sunday night through 1940 and again in 1941, drew peak audiences of 16 million; only [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] was more popular with listeners. [[Graham Greene]] wrote that Priestley "became in the months after Dunkirk a leader second only in importance to Mr Churchill. And he gave us what our other leaders have always failed to give us – an ideology."<ref>Cited in {{cite book<!-- {{sfn|Addison|2011|p=}} --> |title=The Road To 1945: British Politics and the Second World War |last=Addison |first=Paul |publisher=Random House |year=2011|isbn=978-1-4464-2421-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C2hit1s8B04C&q=priestley}}</ref> But his talks were cancelled.<ref>{{cite book|title=Revisiting the Welfare State |series=Introducing Social Policy |last=Page |first=Robert M. |publisher=McGraw-Hill Education (UK) |year=2007 |page=10 |isbn=978-0-335-23498-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Os5EBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA10}}</ref> It was thought that this was the effect of complaints from Churchill that they were too left-wing; however, in 2015 Priestley's son said in a talk on the latest book being published about his father's life that it was in fact Churchill's Cabinet that brought about the cancellation by supplying negative reports on the broadcasts to Churchill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cheltenhamfestivals.com/whats_on/event_detail.html?id=2545 |title=? |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915121708/http://cheltenhamfestivals.com/whats_on/event_detail.html?id=2545 |archive-date=15 September 2008 }}</ref><ref name="biography">{{cite news|title=Priestley war letters published |publisher= BBC News website |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7655113.stm |access-date=10 June 2008 | date=6 October 2008}}</ref>

Priestley chaired the [[1941 Committee]], and in 1942 he was a co-founder of the socialist [[Common Wealth Party]]. The political content of his broadcasts and his hopes of a new and different Britain after the war influenced the politics of the period and helped the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] gain its landslide victory in the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]]. Priestley himself, however, was distrustful of the state and dogma, though he did stand for the [[Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge University]] constituency in 1945.

Priestley's name was on [[Orwell's list]], a list of people which George Orwell prepared in March 1949 for the [[Information Research Department]] (IRD), a propaganda unit set up at the [[Foreign Office]] by the Labour government. Orwell considered or suspected these people to have pro-communist leanings and therefore to be unsuitable to write for the IRD.<ref>{{cite news|title=Blair's babe Did love turn Orwell into a government stooge? |first=John |last=Ezard |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=21 June 2003 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jun/21/books.artsandhumanities |access-date=30 December 2008}}</ref>

He was a founding member of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] in 1958.

In 1960, Priestley published ''Literature and Western Man'', a 500-page survey of [[Western literature]] in all its genres from the second half of the 15th&nbsp;century to the present (the last author discussed is [[Thomas Wolfe]]).

His interest in the problem of time led him to publish an extended essay in 1964 under the title of ''Man and Time'' (Aldus published this as a companion to [[Carl Jung]]'s ''[[Man and His Symbols]]''). In this book he explored in depth various theories and beliefs about time as well as his own research and unique conclusions, including an analysis of the phenomenon of [[precognitive dreams|precognitive dreaming]], based in part on a broad sampling of experiences gathered from the British public, who responded enthusiastically to a televised appeal he made while being interviewed in 1963 on the BBC programme, ''[[Monitor (BBC TV)|Monitor]]''.

[[File:NMM Priestley 01.jpg|thumb|right|Statue outside the National Media Museum]]
The [[University of Bradford]] awarded Priestley the title of honorary [[Doctor of Letters]] in 1970, and he was awarded the [[Freedom of the City]] of Bradford in 1973. His connections with the city were also marked by the naming of the J. B. Priestley Library at the University of Bradford, which he officially opened in 1975,<ref>[http://www.bradford.ac.uk/library/special-collections/collections/j-b-priestley-archive/ J. B.

== Personal life ==
Priestley had a deep love for classical music, especially [[chamber music]]. This love is reflected in a number of Priestley's works, notably his own favourite novel ''Bright Day'' (Heinemann, 1946). His book ''Trumpets Over the Sea'' is subtitled "a rambling and egotistical account of the London Symphony Orchestra's engagement at Daytona Beach, Florida, in July–August 1967".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fagge|first1=Roger|title=The Vision of J.B. Priestley|date=2011|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4411-6379-0|page=Note 9 to Chapter 6|no-pp=yes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_z5o6hPsNLsC&q=Priestley+Trumpets&pg=PT120}}</ref>
 
In 1941 he played an important part in organising and supporting a fund-raising campaign on behalf of the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]], which was struggling to establish itself as a self-governing body after the withdrawal of Sir [[Thomas Beecham]]. In 1949 the opera ''[[The Olympians]]'' by [[Arthur Bliss]], to a libretto by Priestley, was premiered.

Priestley snubbed the chance to become a [[life peer]] in 1965 and also declined appointment as a [[Companion of Honour]] in 1969.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Individuals, now deceased, who refused honours between 1951 and 1999|publisher=[[Cabinet Office]]|date=25 January 2012|url=https://update.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files/resources/document2012-01-24-075439.pdf|access-date=27 January 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120404180350/https%3A//update.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files/resources/document2012%2D01%2D24%2D075439.pdf|archive-date=4 April 2012}}</ref> But he did become a member of the [[Order of Merit]] in 1977. He also served as a British delegate to [[UNESCO]] conferences.

=== Marriages ===
[[File:In The Grove, Highgate - geograph.org.uk - 1834159.jpg|thumb|[[The Grove, Highgate|3 The Grove]]]]
Priestley was married three times. He also had a number of affairs, including a serious relationship with the actress [[Peggy Ashcroft]]. Writing in 1972, Priestley described himself as 'lusty' and as one who has 'enjoyed the physical relations with the sexes … without the feelings of guilt which seems to disturb some of my distinguished colleagues'.<ref name=":0">{{cite ODNB|title=Priestley, John Boynton (1894–1984), writer {{!}} Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/31565|year=2004}}</ref>

In 1921, Priestley married Emily "Pat" Tempest, a music-loving Bradford librarian. Two daughters were born, Barbara (later known as the architect Barbara Wykeham<ref>{{cite news|title= Barbara Wykeham |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1521646/Barbara-Wykeham.html |access-date=15 August 2018}}</ref>) in 1923 and Sylvia (a designer known as [[Sylvia Goaman]] following her marriage to [[Michael Goaman]]<ref>{{cite news|title= Sylvia Goaman |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1527258/Sylvia-Goaman.html |access-date=15 August 2018}}</ref>) in 1924, but in 1925 his wife died of cancer.<ref>[http://unitedagents.co.uk/jb-priestley-estate JB Priestley (estate)]. Unitedagents.co.uk. Retrieved 2 May 2012.</ref>

In September 1926, Priestley married Jane Wyndham-Lewis (ex-wife of the one-time '[[Beachcomber (pen name)|Beachcomber]]' columnist [[D. B. Wyndham-Lewis]], no relation to the artist [[Wyndham Lewis]]); they had two daughters (including music therapist [[Mary Priestley]], conceived while Jane was still married to D. B. Wyndham-Lewis) and one son, the film editor [[Tom Priestley]].<ref name=":0" /> During the [[World War II|Second World War]], Jane ran several residential nurseries for evacuated mothers and their children, many of whom had come from poor districts.<ref>Women's Group on Public Welfare. ''The Neglected Child and His Family''. Oxford University Press: London, 1948, p. x.</ref> For much of their married life they lived in [[Highgate]] at 3 [[The Grove, Highgate|The Grove]], formerly the home of the poet [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Richardson |first1=John |title=Highgate: Its history since the Fifteeenth Century |date=1983 |publisher=Eyre and Spottiswoode |isbn=0-9503656-4-5}}</ref>

In 1953, Priestley was divorced by his second wife, and then married the archaeologist and writer [[Jacquetta Hawkes]], with whom he collaborated on the play ''Dragon's Mouth''.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|title= Biography |publisher= J.

=== Death ===
Priestley died of [[pneumonia]] on 14 August 1984. {{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

His ashes were buried in [[Hubberholme]] Churchyard at the head of [[Wharfedale]] in Yorkshire.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yorkshire-dales.com/hubberholme-church.html|title=Hubberholme Church|website=www.yorkshire-dales.com|access-date=22 April 2020}}</ref> The exact location of his ashes has never been made public and was only known to the three people present. A plaque in the church just states that his ashes are buried 'nearby'. Three photographs exist, showing the ashes being interred, and were taken by Dr. Brian Hoyle Thompson who, along with his wife, were two of the three people present. The brass plate on the box containing the ashes reads J. B. Priestley and can be seen clearly in one of the pictures.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}

== Archive ==
Priestley began placing his papers at the [[Harry Ransom Center]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in 1960, with additions being made throughout his lifetime. The Center has continued to add to the collection through gifts and purchases when possible. The collection currently amounts to roughly 23 boxes, and includes original manuscripts for many of his works and an extensive series of correspondence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://norman.hrc.utexas.edu/fasearch/findingAid.cfm?eadid=01211|title=J.
