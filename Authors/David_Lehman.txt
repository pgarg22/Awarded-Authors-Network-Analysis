==Career==
Born in New York City, David Lehman grew up the son of European Holocaust refugees in Manhattan's northernmost neighborhood of Inwood. He attended [[Stuyvesant High School]] and [[Columbia University]],<ref>{{Cite web|date=Summer 2015|title=Bookshelf|url=https://www.college.columbia.edu/cct/archive/summer15/bookshelf|url-status=live|access-date=August 8, 2021|website=Columbia College Today}}</ref> and [[Cambridge University]] in England on a [[Kellett Fellowship]]. On his return to New York, he received a Ph.D. in English from Columbia, where he was [[Lionel Trilling]]'s research assistant. Lehman's poem "The Presidential Years" appeared in ''[[The Paris Review]]'' No. 43 (Summer 1968) while he was a Columbia undergraduate. The poem was awarded Columbia's Van Rensselaer Poetry Prize in 1967. In 1970 he was named a Woodrow Wilson Fellow and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.

Lehman taught at Brooklyn College, where he shared an office with John Ashbery, for a year. For four years starting in 1976, he was an assistant professor of English at Hamilton College, teaching courses in literature and creative writing and chairing the college's lecture committee, bringing prominent speakers to campus. In 1980 he received a post-doctoral fellowship from the Society for the Humanities at Cornell University. He then left academe and became a freelance writer. He wrote numerous book reviews and articles for Newsweek and contributed to such other publications as the New York Times Magazine, the Washington Post Book World, the Los Angeles Times, the Boston Globe, Newsday, the Chicago Tribune, and the Philadelphia Inquirer. He became a contributing editor of Columbia College Today in 1982 and of Partisan Review in 1986. In 1987 he joined the board of the National Book Critics Circle and was named vice president in charge of programs and events. In 1988 he founded "The Best American Poetry" annual anthology series. ''The Perfect Murder'' (1989) and '' Signs of the Times: Deconstruction and the Fall of Paul de Man'' (1991) were his first nonfiction books.

Lehman's books of poetry include ''Playlist'' (2019), ''Poems in the Manner Of'' (2017), ''New and Selected Poems'' (2013), ''Yeshiva Boys'' (2009), ''When a Woman Loves a Man'' (2005), ''The Evening Sun'' (2002), ''The Daily Mirror'' (2000), and ''Valentine Place'' (1996), all published by Scribner.

He is the author of nine nonfiction books, including, most recently, "One Hundred Autobiographies: A Memoir" (2019), "Sinatra's Century: One Hundred Notes on the Man and His World (2015), and "The State of the Art: A Chronicle of American Poetry, 1988-2014" (2015).

In an interview published in ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]'' Magazine, Lehman discusses the artistry of the great lyricists: “The best song lyrics seem to me so artful, so brilliant, so warm and humorous, with both passion and wit, that my admiration is matched only by my envy ... these lyricists needed to work within boundaries, to get complicated emotions across and fit the lyrics to the music, and to the mood thereof. That takes genius.”<ref>[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/Jewish-Songwriters-American-Songs.html?c=y&page=2 Jewish Songwriters, American Songs], October 7, 2009, Smithsonian.com.</ref>

Lehman's other books of criticism include ''The Last Avant-Garde: The Making of the New York School of Poets'' (Doubleday, 1998), which was named a "Book to Remember 1999" by the [[New York Public Library]]; ''The Big Question'' (1995); ''The Line Forms Here'' (1992) and ''Signs of the Times: Deconstruction and the Fall of [[Paul de Man]]'' (1991). His study of detective novels, ''The Perfect Murder'' (1989), was nominated for an [[Edgar Award]] from the [[Mystery Writers of America]]. A new edition of ''The Perfect Murder'' appeared in 2000.  In October 2015, he published ''[[Sinatra]]'s Century: One Hundred Notes on the Man and His World,'' which Geoffrey O'Brien in "[[The New York Review of Books]]" praised as an "engaging, playful, deeply personal, and elegantly concise tribute."<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/02/11/frank-sinatra-his-way/|title = His Way|last1 = O'Brien|first1 = Geoffrey}}</ref>

Lehman made his living primarily as a journalist and free-lance writer for fifteen years. His by-line appeared  frequently in ''[[Newsweek]]'' in the 1980s and he has continued writing for general-interest magazines and newspapers, among them ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]'', ''[[the Washington Post]]'', ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', ''The Academy of American Poets'', ''[[National Public Radio]]'',<ref>"Poetic Perfection: Three Favorite Poems of 2011," NPR, January 2, 2012.</ref> ''Salon'',<ref>"A Poetry-Free Presidency," Salon.com, January 19, 2001.</ref> ''Slate'',<ref>[http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/classic_poems/2013/01/david_lehman_on_why_thomas_gray_s_ode_on_a_distant_prospect_of_eton_college.html "Where Ignorance is Bliss, Tis Folly To Be Wise"], ''Slate Magazine'', January 22, 2013.</ref> ''Smithsonian'', and ''[[Art in America]]''. He has been a contributing editor at ''[[The American Scholar]]'',<ref>[http://theamericanscholar.org/why_i_love_you/#.UfKsk81_-0Q "Why I Love You"]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''The American Scholar''.</ref> since 2009. From May 2014 until September 2019, he acted as quiz master for the weekly column ''Next Line, Please'', a public poetry-writing contest. The first project was a crowd-sourced sonnet, "Monday," which was completed in August 2014. There followed a haiku, a tanka, an anagram based on Ralph Waldo Emerson's middle name, a couplet (which grew into a "sonnet ghazal"), and a "shortest story" competition. Lehman devises the puzzles — or prompts — and judges the results.<ref>[http://theamericanscholar.org/daily-scholar/next-line-please/ "Next Line, Please"], ''The American Scholar''.</ref> Lehman now writes a monthly column on movies for "The American Scholar".

[[The Library of Congress]] commissioned an essay from Lehman, “Peace and War in American Poetry,” and posted it online in April 2013.<ref>[https://www.loc.gov/poetry/poetry-of-america/essays/essay-davidlehman.html "Peace and War in American Poetry"], [[Library of Congress]], April 2013.</ref> In 2013, Lehman wrote the introduction to ''The Collected Poems of [[Joseph Ceravolo]]''.<ref>[http://www.upne.com/0819573414.html ''The Collected Poems of Joseph Ceravolo''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130924111639/http://www.upne.com/0819573414.html |date=September 24, 2013 }}, Wesleyan Press, 2013.</ref>  He had previously written introductory essays to books by [[A. R. Ammons]],<ref>[http://www.poets.org/printmedia.php/prmMedialD/15766 "Archie: A profile of A. R. Ammons".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110185741/http://www.poets.org/printmedia.php/prmMedialD/15766 |date=November 10, 2013 }}</ref> [[Kenneth Koch]], [[Philip Larkin]], [[Alfred Leslie]], [[Fairfield Porter]], [[Karl Shapiro]], and [[Mark Van Doren]].

In 1994 Lehman succeeded Donald Hall as the general editor of the [[University of Michigan Press]]’s ''Poets on Poetry'' series, a position he held for twelve years. In 1997 he teamed with [[Star Black]] in creating and directing the famed [[KGB (bar)|KGB Bar]] Monday-night poetry series in New York City’s [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]]. Lehman and Black co-edited ''The KGB Bar Book of Poems'' (HarperCollins, 2000). They directed the reading series until 2003.

Lehman taught in the graduate writing program of the [[New School]] in New York City since the program's inception in 1996 and served as poetry coordinator from 2003 to 2018. In an interview with [[Tom Disch]] in the ''[[Cortland Review]]'', Lehman addresses his great variety of poetic styles: "I write in a lot of different styles and forms on the theory that the poems all sound like me in the end, so why not make them as different from one another as possible, at least in outward appearance? If you write a new poem every day, you will probably have by the end of the year, if you’re me, an acrostic, an abecedarium, a sonnet or two, a couple of prose poems, poems that have arbitrary restrictions, such as the one I did that has only two words per line."<ref>[http://www.cortlandreview.com/features/99/09/index.html Tom Disch talks with David Lehman], ''The Courtland Review''.</ref>

Lehman has been awarded fellowships from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation]], the [[Ingram Merrill Foundation]], and the NEA, and received an award in literature from the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] and a [[Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Writer's Award]]. The Lila Wallace grant enabled Lehman to organize and host a series of poetry readings and school visitations in collaboration with the Community School of Music and Art in Ithaca, New York. The visiting poets were Mark Strand and Donald Hall (1992), Charles Simic, Jorie Graham, and A. R. Ammons (1993), and Louise Gluck, Kenneth Koch, and John Ashbery (1994).<ref name=poets/><ref name=best>[http://www.bestamericanpoetry.com/pages/lehman.html David Lehman] at bestamericanpoetry.com.</ref>

Lehman has lectured widely in the United States and abroad. He divides his time between [[Ithaca, New York]], and [[New York City]].  He is married to Stacey Harwood.
