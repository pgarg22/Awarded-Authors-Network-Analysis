'''Arthur Holitscher''' (22 August 1869 – 14 October 1941) was a Hungarian [[playwright]], [[novelist]], [[essay]]ist and writer on traveling. 

Born into an upper middle-class Jewish merchant family in [[Pest, Hungary]], he began his career working for a bank for six years.

His career as a writer began in Germany in the mid-1890s.

==Political involvement with Soviet Russia==
In September 1917, Holitscher attended the [[Third Zimmerwald Conference]] held in [[Stockholm]] in the capacity of a correspondent for the Viennese paper ''[[Die_Presse#History_and_profile|Neuen Freien Presse]]''.<ref name="DB">{{cite web |last1=Biographie |first1=Deutsche |title=Holitscher, Arthur |url=https://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz33450.html |website=www.deutsche-biographie.de |publisher=Deutsche Biographie |language=de}}</ref> He was also involved with the pacifist organisation [[Bund Neues Vaterland]] (New Fatherland Confederation) and was active as a socialist.<ref name="DB"/>
In September 1919 Holitscher was invited to meet with [[Karl Radek]] at [[Moabit|Moabit prison]] to discuss joining a commission to visit Russia. The proposed commission consisted of experts in agriculture, industry, a former Secretary of State as a specialist in administration, a representative of the Radical Workers of Berlin, and the Chief of Police of a large Swiss city. The German authorities were prepared to sanction this, however they decided to send Radek back to Russia in January 1920 and the proposed commission was shelved. Nevertheless, Holitscher was to take a trip to Russia separately departing for three months in September 1920.<ref name="DM2">{{cite book |last1=Holitscher |first1=Arthur |title=Drei Monate in Sowjet-Rußland von Arthur Holitscher|date=1921 |publisher=S.
