'''John Ford''' (1586{{spaced ndash}}c. 1639) was an English playwright and poet of the [[Literature in English#Jacobean literature|Jacobean]] and [[Literature in English#Caroline and Cromwellian literature|Caroline]] eras born in [[Ilsington]] in Devon, England.<ref>{{ cite EB1911|wstitle=Ford, John|volume=10 |pages=641–643}}</ref> His plays deal mainly with the conflict between passion and conscience. Although remembered primarily as a playwright, he also wrote a number of poems on themes of love and morality.

==Origins==
John Ford was [[baptism|baptised]] 17 April 1586 at Ilsington Church, Devon. He was the second son of Thomas Ford (1556–1610) of [[Bagtor]] in the parish of [[Ilsington]], and his wife Elizabeth Popham (died 1629) of the [[John Popham (judge)|Popham family]] of [[Huntworth]] in Somerset.<ref>Vivian, Lt.Col.

[[John Prince (biographer)|Prince]] supposes them to have been descended from the Fords, of Fordmore, in Moreton Hampsted, settled there as early as the 12th century; the heiress of that family married Charles, of Tavistock. The Fords, of Chagford, settled there in consequence of a marriage with the heiress of Hill. John, the fourth in descent, who was of Ashburton, married the heiress of Holwell, by whom he had a daughter and heiress married to St. Clere. The son of a second marriage continued the family. John Ford, of Bagtor, married the heiress of Drake, of Spratshays, in Littleham, and was father of Sir Henry Ford, of [[Nutwell]], who was chief secretary for Ireland, under Arthur Capel, Earl of Essex, and was buried at Woodbury, in 1684: he left a son Charles, supposed to have died in his minority, and three daughters, married to Drake, (ancestor of George Drake, Esq., of Ipplepen,) Holwill, and Egerton. John, second son of John Ford above mentioned, continued the line at Ashburton; Mr. John Ford, who died in 1677, is supposed to have been the last of the branch: there was another younger branch at Totnes.

==Life and work==
Ford left home to study in London, although more specific details are unclear—a sixteen-year-old John Ford of Devon was admitted to [[Exeter College, Oxford]], on 26 March 1601, but this was when the dramatist had not yet reached his sixteenth birthday. He joined an institution that was a prestigious law school but also a centre of literary and dramatic activity—the [[Middle Temple]]. A prominent junior member in 1601 was the playwright [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]]. (It is unknown whether Ford ever actually studied law while a resident of the Middle Temple, or whether he was strictly a gentleman boarder, which was a common arrangement at the time).

It was not until 1606 that Ford wrote his first works for publication. In the spring of that year he was expelled from Middle Temple, due to his financial problems, and ''Fame's Memorial'' and ''Honour Triumphant'' soon followed. Both works are clear bids for [[patronage]]: ''Fame's Memorial'' is an [[elegy]] of 1169 lines on the recently deceased [[Charles Blount, 1st Earl of Devonshire]],<ref>[https://www.dartmoorresource.org.uk/performance/theatre/a-study-of-john-ford/ "John Ford and Dartmoor, A Study of John Ford"], Mark Beeson, 1998.</ref><ref>Stavig, pp. 3–19.</ref> while ''Honour Triumphant'' is a prose pamphlet, a verbal fantasia written in connection with the jousts planned for the summer 1606 visit of King [[Christian IV of Denmark]].<ref>Stavig, pp. 3–19.</ref> It is unknown whether either of these brought any financial remuneration to Ford; yet by June 1608 he had enough money to be readmitted to the Middle Temple.

Prior to the start of his career as a playwright, Ford wrote other non-dramatic literary works—the long religious poem ''Christ's Bloody Sweat'' (1613), and two prose essays published as pamphlets, ''The Golden Mean'' (1613) and ''A Line of Life'' (1620).<ref>Stavig, pp. 20–35.</ref> After 1620 he began active dramatic writing, first as a collaborator with more experienced playwrights—primarily [[Thomas Dekker (poet)|Thomas Dekker]], but also [[John Webster]] and [[William Rowley]]—and by the later 1620s as a solo artist.

Ford is best known for the tragedy ''[['Tis Pity She's a Whore]]'' (1633), a family drama with a plot line of [[incest]]. The play's title has often been changed in new productions, sometimes being referred to as simply ''Giovanni and Annabella''—the play's leading, incestuous brother-and-sister characters; in a nineteenth-century work it is coyly called ''The Brother and Sister''.<ref>William Francis Collier, ''A History of English Literature in a Series of Biographical Sketches,'' London, T. Nelson, 1871; p. 170.</ref> Shocking as the play is, it is still widely regarded as a classic piece of English drama. It has been adapted to film at least twice: ''[[My Sister, My Love (film)|My Sister, My Love]]'' (Sweden, 1966) and '''Tis Pity She's a Whore'' (Belgium, 1978).

He was a major playwright during the reign of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. His plays deal with conflicts between individual passion and [[conscience]] and the laws and morals of society at large;<ref>[https://englishverse.com/poets/ford_john EnglishVerse.com: John Ford]. Accessed July 2020.</ref> Ford had a strong interest in abnormal psychology that is expressed through his dramas. His plays often show the influence of [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]]'s ''[[The Anatomy of Melancholy]]''. While virtually nothing is known of Ford's personal life, one reference suggests that his interest in [[clinical depression|melancholia]] may have been more than merely intellectual. The volume ''Choice Drollery'' (1656) asserts that

::Deep in a dump alone John Ford was gat,
::With folded arms and melancholy hat.<ref>Halliday, p. 172.</ref>

==The canon of Ford's plays==
Ford began his dramatic career in a way common in the period, by contributing to plays co-authored with more established dramatists.  Six such plays survive:
*''[[The Laws of Candy]]'' (1620; printed 1647), with Philip Massinger;
*''[[The Witch of Edmonton]]''  (1621; printed 1658), with Thomas Dekker and William Rowley;
*''The Welsh Ambassador''  (1623; printed 1920), with Dekker;
*''[[The Spanish Gypsy]]'' (licensed 9 July 1623; printed 1653), with Dekker, Thomas Middleton, and Rowley;
*''[[The Sun's Darling]]'' (licensed 3 March 1624; revised 1638–39; printed 1656), with Dekker; 
*''[[The Fair Maid of the Inn]]'' (1626; printed 1647), with Massinger, John Webster, and John Fletcher.

The attributions of several of these plays to their various authors were often debated or regarded as uncertain.   Such questions were placed beyond reasonable doubt in 2017 with the publication of Volume II of ''The Collected Works of John Ford'', ed. Brian Vickers, which contains 300 pages of evidence and discussion clearly identifying each of the above authors' contributions to those six plays. Darren Freebury-Jones has proposed that Ford was responsible for completing ''The Noble Gentleman'' after John Fletcher died in 1625.'''<ref name="John Fletcher’s Collaborator on The Noble Gentleman">{{cite journal|last1=Freebury-Jones|first1=Darren|date=8 March 2021|title=John Fletcher’s Collaborator on The Noble Gentleman|url=https://ojs.utlib.ee/index.php/smp/article/view/smp.2020.7.2.03|journal=Studia Metrica et Poetica|volume=7|issue=2|pages=43–60|access-date=8 March 2021}}</ref>'''

After 1626 Ford made the transition to sole author and wrote a further eight surviving plays:
*''[[The Queen (play)|The Queen]]'' (1627; printed 1653)
*''[[The Lover's Melancholy]]'' (licensed 24 November 1628; printed 1629)
*''[[The Broken Heart]]'' (1629; printed 1633)
*''[['Tis Pity She's a Whore]]'' (1631; printed 1633)
*''[[Love's Sacrifice]]'' (1632; printed 1633)
*[[Perkin Warbeck (play)|''Perkin Warbeck'']] (1633; printed 1634)
*''[[The Fancies Chaste and Noble]]'' (1636; printed 1638)
*''[[The Lady's Trial]]''  (licensed 3 May 1638; printed 1639)

As is typical for pre-Restoration playwrights, a significant portion of Ford's output has not survived. Lost plays by Ford include ''The Royal Combat'' and ''Beauty in a Trance'', plus more collaborations with Dekker: ''The London Merchant, The Bristol Merchant, The Fairy Knight,''<ref>Critics regard the Ford/Dekker ''Fairy Knight'' as distinct from the [[The Fairy Knight|extant manuscript play of the same name]].</ref> and ''[[Keep the Widow Waking]],'' the last also with William Rowley and John Webster.

In 1940, critic [[Alfred Harbage]] argued that Sir [[Robert Howard (playwright)|Robert Howard]]'s play ''[[The Great Favourite]], or The Duke of Lerma'' is an adaptation of a lost play by Ford. Harbage noted that many previous critics had judged the play suspiciously good, too good for Howard; and Harbage pointed to a range of resemblances between the play and Ford's work.<ref>Harbage, pp. 299–304.</ref> The case, however, relies solely upon internal evidence and subjective judgements.
