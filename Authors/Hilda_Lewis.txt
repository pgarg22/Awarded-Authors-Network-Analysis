Most of her works were historical novels, some of which, such as ''I Am Mary Tudor'' (1972), received critical attention. Her young adult historical novel ''[[The Gentle Falcon]]'', was adapted for television.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4796914/ ''The Gentle Falcon''] at [[IMDb]]</ref>

She also wrote a noted [[children's book]], ''The Ship that Flew'' (1939) which concerns [[Norse mythology]] and [[time travel]].

The 1946 novel ''The Day is Ours'' about a young deaf girl was the basis of the film ''[[Mandy (1952 film)|Mandy]]''. The novel in turn was inspired by the work of her husband Professor M. Michael Lewis who was a specialist in the education of the deaf at the [[University of Nottingham]].<ref>{{cite web
