'''Ausiàs March''' (<small>Catalan and</small> {{IPA-va|awziˈaz ˈmaɾk}}; 1400{{snd}}March 3, 1459) was a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Valencian language|Valencian]] [[poet]] and [[knight]] from [[Gandia]], [[Valencian Community|Valencia]]. He is considered one of the most important poets of the "Golden Century" (''Segle d'or'') of [[Catalan literature|Catalan/Valencian literature]].

==Biography==
Not much is known of March's life. He was born in approximately 1400 to a Valencian noble family. His father, [[Pere March]], was himself a poet and served at the court of the younger brother of King [[Alfonso IV of Aragon|Alfonso IV]], Peter. His uncle, [[Jaume March II]], was also a poet. March was one of the two children of Pere's second wife, Lionor of Ripoll; he had a younger sister, Peirona.<ref name="Bio@Iluisvives.com">{{cite web | url=http://www.lluisvives.com/bib_autor/ausiasmarch//include/pausiasmarch_autor.jsp | title=Ausiàs March – L'autor | publisher=Iluisvives.com | access-date=19 March 2014 | language=ca}}</ref>

In 1413, the still-young March became head of his family—part of the Valencian petty nobility—upon the death of his father. From a very young age he took part in the expeditions that King [[Alfons V of Aragon|Alfons el Magnànim]] carried out in the Mediterranean. After returning from these expeditions in 1427, he settled in [[Gandia]]. After his return, he would never again leave the region where he was born. March was twice married: first to Isabel Martorell (sister of the writer [[Joanot Martorell]]), and later to Joana Escorna.

In 1450, he moved from Gandia to [[Valencia]]. It was there that he died on March 3, 1459. While March himself was buried in his family's chapel at the [[Valencia Cathedral]], his two wives and family are buried in the [[Monastery of Sant Jeroni de Cotalba]].<ref>[[Las Provincias]].

Inheriting an easy fortune from his father, Pere March—the treasurer to the [[Duke of Gandia]]—and enjoying the powerful patronage of [[Charles of Viana]], prince of [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], March was able to devote himself to poetical composition. He was an undisguised follower of [[Petrarch]], carrying the imitation to such a point that he addressed his ''Cants d'amor'' (love songs) to a lady whom he professed to have seen first in church on [[Good Friday]].<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=March, Auzias|volume=17|page=688}}</ref> So far as the difference of language allows, he reproduced the rhythmical cadences of his model, but this should be qualified as the medieval tradition of ''locus communis'' requested this following. This is something Petrarch himself did and it need not to be stressed.<ref>For a thorough treatment of ''imitatio'', see Thomas M. Greene's ''The Light in Troy''</ref> March is a very original and idiosyncratic poet. In the ''Cants de mort'' (death hymns) he touches a note of brooding sentiment peculiar to himself.<ref name="EB1911"/> It can be said that he developed Petrarch's rhetoric and used it for more inner psychological meditations, as other major poets like [[Luís de Camões|Camões]] and [[Shakespeare]] would.

March was one of the first poets to use the local vernacular, [[Valencian language|Valencian]], instead of the [[troubadour]] language, [[Occitan]]. 
His poems are marked by obscurity, a sometimes monotonous morbidity, and a conflicting battle between desire and morality, achieved at its apex in the great ''Cant Spiritual''. 
He was fully entitled to the supremacy which he enjoyed among his contemporaries, and the success of his innovation no doubt encouraged [[Juan Boscán Almogáver|Boscán]] to introduce the Italian metres into [[Names given to the Spanish language|Castilian]].
His verses were transmitted in manuscript tradition until its first print edition in Valencian in 1543, but they had already become known through the Spanish translation in 1539.<ref name="EB1911"/>

March's poetry has been set to music by [[Raimon]], [[Joan Brudieu]] and other composers.<ref>Four settings by Brudieu: Fantasiant, Amor a mi descobre. Si fos Amor substança rahonable. Lir entre carts, lo meu voler se tempra. Plena de seny, donau-me una crosta. on CD accompanying book, Magraner, Charles.
