'''Donald Robert Perry Marquis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɑr|k|w|ɪ|s}} {{respell|MAR|kwis}}; July 29, 1878 – December 29, 1937) was an American [[humorist]], [[journalist]], and author. He was variously a [[novelist]], poet, newspaper [[columnist]], and [[playwright]]. He is remembered best for creating the characters [[Archy and Mehitabel]], supposed authors of humorous verse. During his lifetime he was equally famous for creating another fictitious character, "the Old Soak," who was the subject of two books, a hit Broadway play (1922–23), a silent movie (1926) and a talkie (1937).

==Life==
Marquis was born and grew up in [[Walnut, Illinois]]. His brother David died in 1892 at the age of 20; his father James died in 1897. After graduating from Walnut High School in 1894, he attended Knox Academy, a now-defunct preparatory program run by [[Knox College (Illinois)|Knox College]], in 1896, but left after three months. From 1902 to 1907 he served on the editorial board of the ''[[Atlanta]] [[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|Journal]]'' where he wrote many editorials during the heated gubernatorial election between his publisher [[Hoke Smith]] and future [[Pulitzer Prize]] winner, [[Clark Howell]] (Smith was the victor).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atlhistory.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=80&Itemid=1|title=ATLhistory}}</ref>

In 1909, Marquis married Reina Melcher, with whom he had a son, Robert (1915–1921) and a daughter, Barbara (1918–1931). Reina died on December 2, 1923.

Three years later Marquis married the actress Marjorie Potts Vonnegut, whose first husband, actor [[Walter Vonnegut]], was a cousin of American author, playwright and satirist [[Kurt Vonnegut Jr.]] She died in her sleep on October 25, 1936.

Marquis died of a stroke in [[New York City]], after suffering three other strokes that partly disabled him.

On August 23, 1943, the United States Navy christened a [[Liberty ship]], the {{USS|Don Marquis|IX-215}}, in his memory.

==Career==
Marquis began work for the New York newspaper ''[[New York Evening Sun|The Evening Sun]]'' in 1912 and edited for the next eleven years a daily column, "The Sun Dial". During 1922 he left ''The Evening Sun'' (shortened to [[The Sun (New York)|The Sun]] in 1920) for the ''New York Tribune'' (renamed the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' in 1924), where his daily column, "The Tower" (later "The Lantern") was a great success. He regularly contributed columns and short stories to the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'', ''[[Collier's Weekly|Collier's]]'' and ''American'' magazines and also appeared in ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]]'', ''[[Scribner's Magazine|Scribner's]]'', ''Golden Book'', and ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]''.

Marquis's best-known creation was Archy, a fictional [[cockroach]] (developed as a character during 1916) who had been a [[free verse|free-verse]] poet in a previous life, and who supposedly left poems on Marquis's typewriter by jumping on the keys. Archy usually typed only lower-case letters, without punctuation, because he could not operate the shift key. His verses were a type of social satire, and were used by Marquis in his newspaper columns titled "archy and mehitabel"; mehitabel was an alley cat, occasional companion of archy and the subject of some of archy's verses. The archy and mehitabel pieces were illustrated by cartoonist [[George Herriman]], better known to posterity as the author of the newspaper comic [[Krazy Kat]]. Other characters developed by Marquis included [[Don Marquis Pete the Pup|Pete the Pup]], Clarence the ghost, and an egomaniacal toad named Warty Bliggins.

Marquis was the author of about 35 books. He co-wrote (or contributed posthumously) to the films ''The Sports Pages'', ''Shinbone Alley'', ''The Good Old Soak'' and ''[[Skippy (1931 movie)|Skippy]]''. The 1926 film ''[[The Cruise of the Jasper B]]'' was supposedly based on his 1916 novel of the same name, although the plots have little in common.
