'''Colin Henry Hazlewood''' (1823– 31 May 1875) was an [[England|English]] [[playwright]].

Hazlewood became a low comedian on the [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]], [[York]] and western circuits. In 1850, he wrote and produced at the City of London Theatre a farce entitled ''Who's the Victim?'' which was received with favour, and he commenced writing stories for the penny weekly publications. In 1851, he was engaged at the [[Surrey Theatre]], appearing as Bob Blackberry in ''The Rover's Bride'', and was next engaged by Nelson Lee and Johnson for the City of London Theatre as a low comedian. Here he remained ten years, producing numerous dramas, farces and burlesques, among his successes being ''The Bonnet Builders' Tea Party'' at the [[Royal Strand Theatre]]; ''Jenny Foster, the Sailor's Child'' and ''Jessie Vere, or the Return of the Wanderer'', two dramas each in two acts, produced in 1854 and 1856 at the [[Britannia Theatre|Britannia Saloon]], where they had long runs; and ''Waiting for the Verdict'', first given at the [[Norton Folgate|City of London Theatre]].

Hazlewood wrote mainly for the Britannia and Pavilion Theatres, and is said to have been paid at the rate of about fifty shillings an act, with something extra for a very successful piece. He was the most prolific contributor of plays to the Britannia and his sources ranged from recently published novels and serialisations in such journals as ''The Family'', ''The Herald'' and ''Bow Bells'' to juvenile literature, popular paintings and newspaper reports.<ref>G.
