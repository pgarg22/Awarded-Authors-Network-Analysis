''[[Gideon the Ninth]]'', Muir's first novel and the first book of the Locked Tomb series, was published in 2019. It was awarded the 2020 [[Locus Award for Best First Novel]] and the 2020 [[Crawford Award]], presented annually by the International Association for the Fantastic in the Arts. It was nominated for the [[Nebula Award for Best Novel]] and the [[Hugo Award for Best Novel]]. It finished third in the [[Goodreads#Goodreads Choice Awards|Goodreads Choice Awards for best science fiction]] in 2019.<ref>{{cite web| title=Best Science Fiction |publisher=Goodreads | url=https://www.goodreads.com/choiceawards/best-science-fiction-books-2019 |access-date=2020-01-01}}</ref> The front cover blurb by [[Charles Stross]] describes the story as "Lesbian necromancers explore a haunted gothic palace in space!".<ref name=Vox>{{cite web|publisher=Vox| author-first=Constance |author-last=Grady | title=Gideon the Ninth is about lesbian necromancers in space.

She has a genius for sliding her voice seamlessly from Lovecraftian gothic mode into a slangy contemporary mode without ever undercutting one or the other for cheap comedy. Instead, the contemporary mode makes the cast of characters feel familiar and recognizable, the Lovecraftian horror makes the world feel expansive and terrifying, and the slippage between both powers the book forward."<ref name=Vox/> Jason Sheehan said: "Gideon the Ninth is too funny to be horror, too gooey to be science fiction, has too many spaceships and autodoors to be fantasy, and has far more bloody dismemberings than your average parlor romance. It is altogether its own thing — brilliantly original, messy and weird straight through."<ref>{{cite web|title=Smart, Snarky 'Gideon The Ninth' Swears Her Way Through The Stars |url=https://www.npr.org/2019/09/09/755170550/smart-snarky-gideon-the-ninth-swears-her-way-through-the-stars|publisher=NPR|date=2019-09-09|access-date=2020-01-01| author-first=Jason | author-last=Sheehan}}</ref>
