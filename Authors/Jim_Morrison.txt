'''James Douglas Morrison''' (December 8, 1943 – July 3, 1971) was an American singer, poet and songwriter who was the [[lead vocalist]] of the [[Rock music|rock]] band [[the Doors]]. Due to his wild personality, poetic lyrics, distinctive voice, unpredictable and erratic performances, and the dramatic circumstances surrounding his life and early death, Morrison is regarded by music critics and fans as one of the most iconic and influential frontmen in rock history. Since his death, his fame has endured as one of popular culture's most rebellious and oft-displayed icons, representing the [[generation gap]] and youth [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]].<ref name="Huey">{{cite web

Together with pianist [[Ray Manzarek]], Morrison co-founded the Doors in 1965 in [[Venice, California]]. The group spent two years in obscurity until shooting to prominence with their number-one single in the United States, "[[Light My Fire]]", taken from their [[The Doors (album)|self-titled debut album]]. Morrison recorded a total of six studio albums with the Doors, all of which sold well and received critical acclaim. Morrison was well known for improvising [[spoken word]] poetry passages while the band played live.  Manzarek said Morrison "embodied [[hippie]] counterculture rebellion".<ref>{{cite web |last=Knopper |first=Steve|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-11-09/entertainment/ct-ott-1111-ray-manzarek-20111110_1_jim-morrison-doors-robby-krieger|title=Ray Manzarek's Doors |website=[[ChicagoTribune.com]] |date=November 9, 2011|access-date=April 16, 2014}}</ref>

== Biography ==
=== 1943–1961: Early years ===
Morrison was born in late 1943 in [[Melbourne, Florida]], to Clara Virginia (née Clarke) and [[Lieutenant (junior grade)|Lt.(j.g.)]] [[George Stephen Morrison]], a future [[Rear admiral (United States)|rear admiral]] in the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ivbc.free.fr/AA-Histoire-9999-99-96.htm|title=Soft Parade 6571|website=Ivbc.free.fr|access-date=April 16, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004213850/http://ivbc.free.fr/AA-Histoire-9999-99-96.htm|archive-date=October 4, 2013}}</ref> His&nbsp;ancestors were Scottish, Irish, and English.<ref>[http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biography_story/1930:2450/1/Jim_Morrison.htm Dead Famous: Jim Morrison] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827015646/http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biography_story/1930%3A2450/1/Jim_Morrison.htm |date=August 27, 2008 |website=[[The Biography Channel]] |accessdate= December 2, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2003-09-01-riding-the-storm-again-without-morrison|title=Riding the Storm Again – without Morrison &#124; News &#124; Mail & Guardian|website=Mg.co.za|date=September 1, 2003|access-date=April 16, 2014}}</ref> Admiral Morrison commanded U.S. naval forces during the [[Gulf of Tonkin incident]] in August 1964, which provided the pretext for the [[Vietnam War#American ground war|U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War]] in 1965. Morrison had a younger sister, Anne Robin (born 1947 in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]), and a younger brother, Andrew Lee Morrison (born 1948 in [[Los Altos, California]]).<ref>{{cite web

In 1947, when he was three to four years old, Morrison allegedly witnessed a car accident in the desert, during which a truck overturned and some [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] were lying injured at the side of the road. He referred to this incident in the Doors' song "[[Peace Frog]]" on their 1970 album ''[[Morrison Hotel]]'', as well as in the spoken word performances "Dawn's Highway" and "Ghost Song" on the posthumous 1978 album ''[[An American Prayer]]''. Morrison believed this incident to be the most formative event of his life,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Davis|first=Stephen|title=Jim Morrison: Life, Death, Legend|publisher=[[Ebury Press]]|year=2004|page=8|quote=It was the first time I discovered death, he recounted many years later, as the tape rolled in a darkened West Hollywood Recording studio.|isbn=978-0-09-190042-7}}</ref> and made repeated references to it in the imagery in his songs, poems, and interviews.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fans push to preserve Jim Morrison's New Mexico home

His family does not recall this traffic incident happening in the way he told it. According to the Morrison biography ''[[No One Here Gets Out Alive]]'', Morrison's family did drive past a car accident on an [[Indian reservation]] when he was a child, and he was very upset by it.<ref name="Hopkins" /> The book ''The Doors'', written by the surviving members of the Doors, explains how different Morrison's account of the incident was from that of his father. This book quotes his father as saying, "We went by several Indians. It did make an impression on him [the young James]. He always thought about that crying Indian."<ref>{{cite book |first1=the |last1=Doors |author-link1=The Doors |last2=Fong-Torres |first2=Ben |author-link2=Ben Fong-Torres |title=The Doors |publisher=Hyperion |date=October 25, 2006 |isbn=978-1-4013-0303-7}}</ref> This is contrasted sharply with Morrison's tale of "Indians scattered all over the highway, bleeding to death." In the same book, his sister is quoted as saying, "He enjoyed telling that story and exaggerating it. He said he saw a dead Indian by the side of the road, and I don't even know if that's true."<ref name=gaar>{{cite book|last1=Gaar|first1=Gillian G.|title=The Doors: The Illustrated History|date=2015|publisher=Voyageur Press|location=Minneapolis (US)|isbn=978-1-62788-705-2|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GzLCCAAAQBAJ}}</ref>

Raised a [[Military brat (U.S. subculture)|military brat]], Morrison spent part of his childhood in San Diego, completed third grade in [[Northern Virginia|northern]] [[Virginia]] at [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]] Elementary School, and attended Charles H. Flato Elementary School in [[Kingsville, Texas]], while his father was stationed at [[Naval Air Station Kingsville|NAS Kingsville]] in 1952. He continued at St. John's Methodist School in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], and then Longfellow School Sixth Grade Graduation Program from San Diego.<ref name=wrank>{{cite web|last1=Wranker|first1=Ralph|title=The King's Highway Jim Morrison in Kingsville, Texas|url=http://www.taliesyn.com/ralph/morrison.htm|website=Taliesyn.com|access-date=December 1, 2015}}</ref>

In 1957, Morrison attended [[Alameda High School]] in [[Alameda, California]], for his freshman and first semester of his sophomore year.<ref>{{Cite web

=== 1961–1963: Literary influences ===
A voracious reader from an early age, Morrison was particularly inspired by the writings of several philosophers and poets. He was influenced by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], whose views on aesthetics, morality, and the [[Apollonian and Dionysian]] duality would appear in his conversation, poetry and songs. Some of his formative influences were [[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Parallel Lives]]'' and the works of the French [[Symbolist]] poet [[Arthur Rimbaud]], whose style would later influence the form of Morrison's short prose poems. He was also influenced by [[William S. Burroughs]], [[Jack Kerouac]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Louis-Ferdinand Céline]], [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]], [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Vladimir Nabokov]], [[Molière]], [[Franz Kafka]], [[Albert Camus]], [[Honoré de Balzac]] and [[Jean Cocteau]], along with most of the French [[existentialism|existentialist]] philosophers.<ref name=gaar /><ref name=More>{{cite web|last1=More|first1=Thomas|title=The Verse of the Lizard King: An Analysis Of Jim Morrison's Work|url=http://www.returnofkings.com/21445/the-verse-of-the-lizard-king-an-analysis-of-jim-morrisons-work|website=Return of Kings|access-date=December 1, 2015|date=December 3, 2013}}</ref>

His senior year English teacher said, "Jim read as much and probably more than any student in class, but everything he read was so offbeat I had another teacher (who was going to the [[Library of Congress]]) check to see if the books Jim was reporting on actually existed. I suspected he was making them up, as they were English books on sixteenth- and seventeenth-century [[demonology]]. I'd never heard of them, but they existed, and I'm convinced from the paper he wrote that he read them, and the Library of Congress would've been the only source."<ref name="Hopkins" />

Morrison went to live with his paternal grandparents in [[Clearwater, Florida]], and attended  [[St. Petersburg College|St. Petersburg Junior College]]. In 1962, he transferred to [[Florida State University]] (FSU) in [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]], and appeared in a school recruitment film.<ref name="fsufilm">{{cite web|title=Florida State University: Toward a Greater University|url=http://floridamemory.com/items/show/232390|access-date=September 18, 2011}}</ref> While at FSU, Morrison was arrested for disturbing the peace while drunk at  a home [[1963 Florida State Seminoles football team|football]] game on September 28, [[1963 Florida State Seminoles football team|1963]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/jim-morrison-arrest-history/|title=Jim Morrison Arrest History|work=Ultimate Classic Rock|date= August 4, 2015|first=Ted |last=Asregadoo}}</ref>

=== 1964–1965: College experience in Los Angeles ===
In January 1964, Morrison moved to Los Angeles to attend the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA). Seven months later<!--on August 2, 1964-->, [[George Stephen Morrison|his father]] commanded a carrier division of the U.S. fleet during the [[Gulf of Tonkin Incident]].  At&nbsp;UCLA, Morrison enrolled in [[Jack Hirschman]]'s class on [[Antonin Artaud]] in the Comparative Literature program within the UCLA English Department. Artaud's brand of [[surrealist]] theatre had a profound impact on Morrison's dark poetic sensibility of cinematic theatricality.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lauerman|first1=Connie|title=Artaud: The 'Madman' Who Changed Theater|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-02-15/features/9602150259_1_antonin-artaud-paris-goodman-theatre|access-date=December 1, 2015|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=February 15, 1996}}</ref>

During these years, while living in Venice Beach, he befriended writers at the ''[[Los Angeles Free Press]]'', for which he advocated until his death in&nbsp;1971. He&nbsp;conducted a lengthy and in-depth interview with Bob Chorush and Andy Kent, both working for the ''Free Press'' at the time (approximately December 6–8, 1970), and was planning on visiting the headquarters of the busy newspaper shortly before leaving for&nbsp;Paris.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Melissa Ursula Dawn Goldsmith|title=Criticism lighting his fire: perspectives on Jim Morrison from the Los Angeles Free Press, Down Beat, and the Miami Herald|url=http://digitalcommons.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3871&context=gradschool_theses|publisher=lsu.edu|access-date=July 11, 2017|format=PDF}}</ref>

=== 1965–1971: The Doors ===
{{Main|The Doors}}
[[File:Doors electra publicity photo.JPG|thumb|A promotional photo of the Doors in late 1966]]
In the middle of 1965, after graduating with a [[bachelor's degree]] from the UCLA film school, Morrison led a [[bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle in Venice Beach. Living on the rooftop of a building inhabited by his old UCLA cinematography friend, Dennis Jacobs, he wrote the lyrics of many of the early songs the Doors would later perform live and record on albums, such as "[[Moonlight Drive]]" and "[[Hello, I Love You]]". According to [[Ray Manzarek]], he lived on canned beans and LSD for several months.<ref name=NPRRay/>

Morrison and fellow UCLA student Ray Manzarek were the first two members of the Doors, forming the group during that summer.<ref name=NPRRay>{{Cite news|last=Rogers|first=Brent|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/05/24/185827139/remembering-ray-manzarek-keyboardist-for-the-doors|title=Remembering Ray Manzarek, Keyboardist For The Doors|work=NPR.org|access-date=June 11, 2018|language=en}}</ref> They had met months earlier as cinematography students. Manzarek narrated the story that he was lying on the beach at Venice one day, where he accidentally encountered Morrison.<ref name=NPRRay /> He was impressed with Morrison's poetic lyrics, claiming that they were "rock group" material. Subsequently, guitarist [[Robby Krieger]] and drummer [[John Densmore]] joined. Krieger auditioned at Densmore's recommendation and was then added to the lineup. All three musicians shared a common interest in the [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]]'s meditation practices at the time, attending scheduled classes, but Morrison was not involved in these series of classes.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bollinger|first1=Michael J.|title=Jim Morrison's Search for God|date=2012|publisher=Trafford Publishing|isbn=978-1-4669-1101-7|page=41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rPppwQ8qj2IC|language=en}}</ref>

Morrison was inspired to name the band after the title of [[Aldous Huxley]]'s book ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'' (a reference to the unlocking of doors of perception through [[psychedelic drug]] use). Huxley's own concept was based on a quotation from [[William Blake]]'s ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'', in which Blake wrote: "If the doors of perception were cleansed everything would appear to man as it is, infinite."<ref>{{cite AV media |title=[[When You're Strange]] |date=January 2009 |people=The Doors |type=Documentary |publisher=[[Rhino Entertainment]]}}</ref>

Although Morrison was known as the lyricist of the group, Krieger also made lyrical contributions, writing or co-writing some of the group's biggest hits, including "[[Light My Fire]]", "[[Love Me Two Times]]", "[[Love Her Madly]]" and "[[Touch Me (The Doors song)|Touch Me]]".<ref>{{cite web|last=Getlen|first=Larry|title=Opportunity Knocked So The Doors Kicked It Down|url=http://www.bankrate.com/brm/news/investing/20030616a1.asp|access-date=August 24, 2008}}</ref> On the other hand, Morrison, who did not write most songs using an instrument, would come up with vocal melodies for his own lyrics, with the other band members contributing chords and rhythm.<ref name=classicalbums>{{cite AV media |people=[[The Doors]] |title=Classic Albums: The Doors |title-link=Classic Albums |year=2008 |publisher=[[Eagle Rock Entertainment]] |medium=DVD |time=20:05}}</ref>  Morrison did not play an instrument live (except for [[maracas]] and [[tambourine]] for most shows, and [[harmonica]] on a few occasions) or in the studio (excluding maracas, tambourine, [[handclaps]], and [[whistling]]).

In November 1966, Morrison and the Doors produced a promotional film for "[[Break On Through (To the Other Side)]]", which was their first single release. The film featured the four members of the group playing the song on a darkened set with alternating views and close-ups of the performers while Morrison lip-synched the lyrics. Morrison and the Doors continued to make short music films, including "[[The Unknown Soldier (song)|The Unknown Soldier]]",<ref>{{cite web

This was a far cry from the Doors opening for [[Simon and Garfunkel]] or playing at a high school as they did in Connecticut that same year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/1967-08-12/hot-100|title=Billboard.com – Hot 100 – Week of August 12, 1967|work=Billboard|access-date=September 18, 2011}}</ref> Later, the Doors appeared on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', a popular Sunday night variety series that had introduced [[the Beatles]] and [[Elvis Presley]] to the United States. [[Ed Sullivan]] requested two songs from the Doors for the show, "[[People Are Strange]]" and "Light My Fire".<ref name="The Doors">{{cite web|url=http://www.edsullivan.com/artists/the-doors|title=The Doors|website=The Ed Sullivan Show |publisher=(SOFA Entertainment)|access-date=November 24, 2010}}</ref><ref name="Hogan 1994 30">{{cite book |first=Peter K. |last=Hogan |year=1994 |title=The Complete Guide To the Music of the Doors |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QDbS4d7nu_4C |publisher=Music Sales Group |page=30 |isbn=978-0-7119-3527-3}}</ref> Sullivan's censors insisted that the Doors change the lyrics of the song "Light My Fire" from "Girl we couldn't get much higher" to "Girl we couldn't get much better" for the television viewers; this was reportedly due to what was perceived as a reference to drugs in the original lyrics. After giving assurances of compliance to the producer in the dressing room, the band agreed and proceeded to sing the song with the original lyrics. Sullivan was not happy and he refused to shake hands with Morrison or any other band member after their performance. Sullivan had a show producer tell the band that they would never appear on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' again. Morrison reportedly said to the producer, in a defiant tone, "Hey man. We just ''did'' the Sullivan Show!"<ref name="The Doors" /><ref name="Hogan 1994 30" />

By the release of their second album, ''[[Strange Days (Doors album)|Strange Days]]'', the Doors had become one of the most popular rock bands in the United States. Their blend of [[blues]] and dark [[psychedelic rock]] included a number of original songs and distinctive cover versions, such as their rendition of "[[Alabama Song]]", from [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Kurt Weill]]'s opera, ''[[Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny]]''.<ref>{{cite book |first=Christian |last=Matijas-Mecca |year=2020 |title=Listen to Psychedelic Rock! Exploring a Musical Genre |page=76 |publisher=Hardcover |isbn=978-1440861970}}</ref> The band also performed a number of extended concept works, including the songs "[[The End (The Doors song)|The End]]", "[[When the Music's Over]]", and "[[Celebration of the Lizard]]". In late Summer 1967, photographer [[Joel Brodsky]] took a series of [[Photography#Black-and-white|black-and-white]] photos of Morrison, in a photo shoot known as "The Young Lion" photo session. These photographs are considered among the most iconic images of Jim Morrison and are frequently used as covers for compilation albums, books, and other memorabilia of the Doors and Morrison.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/music/story/2007/04/02/joel-brodsky.html|title=Album photographer Joel Brodsky dies – Arts & Entertainment|date=April 2, 2007|publisher=CBC News|access-date=September 18, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sunjournal.com/node/630550|title=Photographer Brodsky dies|date=April 1, 2007|newspaper=Sun Journal|access-date=September 18, 2011}}</ref> In late 1967 at a concert in [[New Haven]], [[Connecticut]], he was arrested on stage, an incident that further added to his mystique and emphasized his rebellious image.<ref name=3otbkd>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RfYgAAAAIBAJ&pg=3382%2C1557736 |work=The Day |location=(New London, Connecticut) |title=Doors' chief, 3 others booked |date=December 11, 1967 |page=19}}</ref> Morrison was the first rock artist to be arrested onstage during a live performance.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=James Riordan |title=Break On Through: The Life and Death of Jim Morrison |last2=Jerry Prochnicky |publisher=Quill |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-688-11915-7 |page=20 |author-link=James Riordan}}</ref>

In 1968, the Doors released their third studio album, ''[[Waiting for the Sun]]''. The band performed on July 5 at the Hollywood Bowl; this performance became famous with the DVD: ''Live at the Hollywood Bowl''. It's also this year that the band played, for the first time, in Europe. Their fourth album, ''[[The Soft Parade]]'', was released in 1969. It was the first album where the individual band members were given credit on the inner sleeve for the songs they had written. Previously, each song on their albums had been credited simply to "The Doors".<ref>{{cite book |first=Christian |last=Matijas-Mecca |year=2020 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=knTtDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA80 |title=Listen to Psychedelic Rock!

On September 6 and 7, 1968, the Doors played four performances at the [[Roundhouse (venue)|Roundhouse]], London, England with [[Jefferson Airplane]] which was filmed by Granada for a television documentary ''[[The Doors Are Open]]'' directed by John Sheppard. Around this time, Morrison—who had long been a heavy drinker—started showing up for recording sessions visibly inebriated.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cinquemani|first1=Sal|title=The Doors: A Retro Perspective|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/features/article/the-doors-a-retro-perspective|website=Slant Magazine|access-date=July 11, 2017|date=March 1, 2007}}</ref> He was also frequently appearing in live performances and studio recordings late or stoned.<ref>{{cite book |first=John |last=Anthony Moretta |year=2017 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CpX4DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA317 |title=The Hippies: A 1960s History |page=317 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0786499496}}</ref>

By early 1969, the formerly svelte singer had gained weight, grown a beard and begun dressing more casually — abandoning the leather pants and concho belts for slacks, jeans, and T-shirts. During a concert on March 1 at the [[Dinner Key Auditorium]] in Miami, Morrison attempted to spark a riot in the audience, in part by screaming "You wanna see my cock?" and other obscenities. Three days later, six [[arrest warrant|warrants]] for his arrest were issued by the [[Miami-Dade Police Department|Dade County Police department]] for [[indecent exposure]], among other accusations.<ref name="FSU arrest">{{cite news|last=Yanez|first=Luisa|title=Flashback: The Doors' Jim Morrison stage antics, arrest, trial|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/article1937284.html|newspaper=Miami Herald|access-date=July 11, 2017|date=December 9, 2010}}</ref><ref name="Burks_12/10/2010">{{cite magazine|last=Burks|first=John|title=Jim Morrison's Indecency Arrest: Rolling Stone's Original Coverage|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=December 10, 2010|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/jim-morrison-s-indecency-arrest-rolling-stone-s-original-coverage-20101210|access-date=February 19, 2017|quote=[He] became the object of six arrest warrants, including one for a felony charge of 'Lewd and lascivious behavior in public by exposing his private parts and by simulating masturbation and oral copulation."<br /> The five other warrants are for misdemeanor charges on two counts of indecent exposure, two counts of open public profanity and one of public drunkenness.'}}</ref>

Following ''[[The Soft Parade]]'', the Doors released ''[[Morrison Hotel]]''. After a lengthy break, the group reconvened in October 1970 to record their final album with Morrison, titled ''[[L.A.

They instead instilled discipline and levied punishment by the military tradition known as "[[dressing down]]". This consisted of yelling at and berating the children until they were reduced to tears and acknowledged their failings.<ref name="Hopkins" /> Once Morrison graduated from UCLA, he broke off most contact with his family. By the time Morrison's music ascended to the top of the charts (in 1967) he had not been in communication with his family for more than a year and falsely claimed that his parents and siblings were dead (or claiming, as it has been widely misreported, that he was an only child).<ref name="final24">{{cite episode |series=[[Final 24]] |title=Jim Morrison |year=2007 |place=Canada |publisher=[[Global Television Network]]}}</ref>

This misinformation was published as part of the materials distributed with the Doors' [[The Doors (album)|self-titled debut album]]. Admiral Morrison was not supportive of his son's career choice in music. One day, an acquaintance brought over a record thought to have Jim on the cover. The record was the Doors' self-titled debut. The young man played the record for Morrison's father and family. Upon hearing the record, Morrison's father wrote him a letter telling him "to give up any idea of singing or any connection with a music group because of what I consider to be a complete lack of talent in this direction."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idafan.com/cleveland_plain_dealer-exhbit-preview.html|title=Love Them Two Times|access-date=May 18, 2010|last=Soeder|first=John|date=May 20, 2007|work=Plain Dealer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613025902/http://www.idafan.com/cleveland_plain_dealer-exhbit-preview.html|archive-date=June 13, 2011}}</ref> In a letter to the Florida Probation and Parole Commission District Office dated October 2, 1970, Morrison's father acknowledged the breakdown in family communications as the result of an argument over his assessment of his son's musical talents.

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Pamela Courson&Jim Morrison.jpeg|right|thumb|250px|Morrison with girlfriend Pamela Courson, 1969.]] -->
Morrison was sought after by many as a photographer's model, confidante, romantic partner and sexual conquest.

One of Morrison's early significant relationships was with Mary Werbelow, whom he met on the beach in Florida, when they were teenagers in 1962. In a 2005 interview with the ''St. Petersburg Times'', she said Morrison spoke to her before a photo shoot for the Doors' fourth album and told her the first three albums were about her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2005/09/25/Doors/Mary_and_Jim_to_the_e.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051107032218/http://www.sptimes.com/2005/09/25/Doors/Mary_and_Jim_to_the_e.shtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 7, 2005|title=Doors: Mary and Jim to the end|work=Sptimes.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/jim-morrison/press/z-machine-starts-production-on-documentary-film-before-the-end-jim-morrison-comes-age|title=Z-machine Starts Production on Documentary Film, Before The End: Jim Morrison Comes Age|work=Contactmusic.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://madameask.com/2014/10/06/interview-with-paul-ferrara-doors-photographer/|title=Interview with Paul Ferrara, Doors photographer|work=madameask.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160810232101/https://madameask.com/2014/10/06/interview-with-paul-ferrara-doors-photographer/|archive-date=August 10, 2016}}</ref><ref name="Weidman194">{{cite book|author=Rich Weidman|title=The Doors FAQ: All That's Left to Know About the Kings of Acid Rock|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HjPcWkEPSR8C&q=jim+morrison+mary+werbelow&pg=PT194|date=October 1, 2011|publisher=Backbeat Books|isbn=978-1-61713-110-3|page=194}}</ref>

Courson was buried by her family as Pamela Susan Morrison, after Jim Morrison's death, despite the two having never been married. After Courson's death in 1974 her parents petitioned the court for inheritance of Morrison's estate. The [[probate]] court in California decided that she and Morrison had once had what qualified as a [[common-law marriage]], despite neither having applied for such status, and the common-law marriage not being recognized in California. Morrison's will at the time of his death named Courson as the sole heir.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truetrust.com/Famous_Wills_and_Trusts/Jim_Morrison_Will.pdf|title=Last Will and Testament of Jim Morrison|website=Truetrust.com\accessdate=2016-08-27}}</ref>

Morrison dedicated his published poetry books ''The Lords and New Creatures'' and the lost writings ''Wilderness'' to her. A number of writers have speculated that songs like "[[Love Street]]", "Orange County Suite" and "Queen of the Highway", among other songs, may have been written about her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.92kqrs.com/2017/02/14/ode-to-a-deep-love/|title=Ode to a Deep Love|work=92KQRS.com – KQRS-FM|access-date=April 16, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517103635/http://www.92kqrs.com/2017/02/14/ode-to-a-deep-love/|archive-date=May 17, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="Weidman210">{{cite book|first=Rich |last=Weidman|title=The Doors FAQ: All That's Left to Know About the Kings of Acid Rock|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HjPcWkEPSR8C&q=songs+about+pamela+courson&pg=PT210|date=October 1, 2011|publisher=Backbeat Books|isbn=978-1-61713-110-3|page=210}}</ref> Though the relationship was "tumultuous" much of the time, and both also had relationships with others, they always maintained a unique and ongoing connection with one another, right up until the end.<ref name=RiordanRel21 /><ref name=Wonderland>{{cite book|first=Danny|last=Sugerman|title=Wonderland Avenue: Tales of Glamour and Excess|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|location=New York City|date=1995|isbn=0-316-77354-9}}</ref>

The couple had been friends, and then in a long-distance relationship, since meeting at a private interview for ''[[Jazz & Pop]]'' magazine in January 1969. The handfasting ceremony is described in ''No One Here Gets Out Alive'' as a "blending of souls on a karmic and cosmic plane". Morrison was also still seeing Pamela Courson when he was in Los Angeles, and later moved to Paris for the summer where Courson had acquired an apartment.

While he was still at school, his family moved to [[New Mexico]] where he got to see some of the places and artifacts important to the [[American Southwest]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous]] cultures.

His interpretation and imagination of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] ceremonies and peoples (which, based on his readings, he referred to by the anthropological term "[[shaman]]s") influenced his stage routine, notably in seeking trance states and vision through dancing to the point of exhaustion.<ref>{{cite web

Morrison's vocal influences included [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Frank Sinatra]], which can be heard in his baritone [[Crooner|crooning]] style on several of the Doors' songs. In the 1981 documentary ''The Doors: A Tribute to Jim Morrison'', producer [[Paul Rothchild]] relates his first impression of Morrison as being a "Rock and Roll Bing Crosby". Sound engineer, [[Bruce Botnick]], has recalled that when he first met the Doors in [[Sunset Sound Studios]], Botnick showed them the [[condenser microphone]], which Morrison would then use when recording his vocals for their debut album. Morrison was particularly excited about this microphone (the [[Neumann U47|Telefunken U47]]) as it was the same model that Frank Sinatra had used for some of his recording sessions.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=[[The Doors]] |title=Classic Albums: The Doors |year=2008 |publisher=Eagle Rock Entertainment |medium=DVD |time=18:02}}</ref> Sugerman has written that Morrison, as a teenager, was such a fan of Elvis Presley that he demanded silence when Elvis was on the radio, but that Sinatra was Morrison's favorite singer.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/6027/32782/33583|title=100 Greatest Singers: Jim Morrison|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=April 16, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207052622/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/6027/32782/33583|archive-date=December 7, 2010}}</ref> According to record producer [[David Anderle]], Morrison considered [[Brian Wilson]] "his favorite musician" and [[the Beach Boys]]' 1967 LP ''[[Wild Honey (album)|Wild Honey]]'' "one of his favorite albums. ... he really got into it."<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Anderle |first1=David |last2=Williams |first2=Paul |author-link1=David Anderle|author-link2=Paul Williams (journalist)|title=Brian: Part Three |magazine=[[Crawdaddy!]] |date=1968}}</ref>

[[Wallace Fowlie]], professor emeritus of [[French literature]] at [[Duke University]], wrote ''Rimbaud and Jim Morrison'', subtitled ''"The Rebel as Poet&nbsp;– A Memoir"''. In this, he recounts his surprise at receiving a fan letter from Morrison who, in 1968, thanked him for his latest translation of [[Arthur Rimbaud]]'s verse into English. "I don't read French easily", he wrote, "...your book travels around with me." Fowlie went on to give lectures on numerous campuses comparing the lives, philosophies, and poetry of Morrison and Rimbaud. The book ''The Doors'' by the remaining Doors quotes Morrison's close friend Frank Lisciandro as saying that too many people took a remark of Morrison's that he was interested in revolt, disorder, and chaos "to mean that he was an anarchist, a revolutionary, or, worse yet, a [[nihilism|nihilist]]. Hardly anyone noticed that Jim was paraphrasing Rimbaud and the [[surrealism|Surrealist]] poets".<ref>{{cite book|author1=Ben Fong-Torres|author-link1=Ben Fong-Torres|title=The Doors|date=2006|publisher=Hyperion|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4013-0303-7|page=104|edition=1st}}</ref>

== Poetry and film ==
Morrison began writing in earnest during his adolescence. At UCLA he studied the related fields of theater, film, and [[cinematography]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Notable Actors – UCLA School of Theater, Film and television|url=http://www.tft.ucla.edu/alumni/notable-actors/|access-date=December 3, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713125858/http://www.tft.ucla.edu/alumni/notable-actors/ |archive-date=July 13, 2010}}</ref> He self-published two volumes of his poetry in 1969, titled ''The Lords / Notes on Vision'' and ''The New Creatures''. ''The Lords'' consists primarily of brief descriptions of places, people, events and Morrison's thoughts on cinema. ''The New Creatures'' verses are more poetic in structure, feel and appearance. These two books were later combined into a single volume titled ''The Lords and The New Creatures''. These were the only writings published during Morrison's lifetime. Morrison befriended [[Beat generation|Beat poet]] [[Michael McClure]], who wrote the [[afterword]] for [[Jerry Hopkins (author)|Jerry Hopkins]]' biography of Morrison, ''[[No One Here Gets Out Alive]]''. McClure and Morrison reportedly collaborated on a number of unmade film projects, including a film version of McClure's infamous play ''The Beard'', in which Morrison would have played [[Billy the Kid]].<ref>{{cite web|last=McClure|first=Michael|title=Michael McClure Recalls an Old Friend|url=http://archives.waiting-forthe-sun.net/Pages/Players/Personal/mcclure_recalls.html|access-date=September 9, 2008}}</ref>

The first was in March 1969 in Los Angeles and the second was on December 8, 1970. The latter recording session was attended by Morrison's personal friends and included a variety of sketch pieces. Some of the segments from the 1969 session were issued on the [[bootleg recording|bootleg]] album ''[[The Lost Paris Tapes]]'' and were later used as part of the Doors' ''[[An American Prayer]]'' album, released in 1978.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=Far Out staff |date=March 13, 2021 |title=Jim Morrison's last known recordings |url=https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/doors-jim-morrison-last-ever-recording/amp |magazine=Far Out |access-date=November 10, 2021}}</ref>

Morrison financed the venture and formed his own production company in order to maintain complete control of the project. [[Paul Ferrara]], [[Frank Lisciandro]], and Babe Hill assisted with the project. Morrison played the main character, a hitchhiker turned killer/car thief.

The concluding [[stanza]]s of this poem convey disappointment for someone with whom he had had an intimate relationship and contain a further [[invocation]] of ''[[HWY: An American Pastoral#Billy|Billy]]'' the killer/Hitchhiker, a common character in Morrison's body of work. "This is my poem for you, Great flowing funky flower'd beast, Great perfumed wreck of hell...Someone new in your knickers & who would that be?

Kilmer learned over 20 of Doors' songs to achieve Morrison's role.<ref>{{cite web |first=Kevin |last=Burwick |url=https://movieweb.com/amp/the-doors-movie-1991-val-kilmer-rehearsal-video-jim-morrison/ |title=Val Kilmer Shares Rare Doors Movie Rehearsal Video |website= [[MovieWeb]] |date=June 14, 2017 |access-date=April 12, 2021}}</ref> While the film was inspired by many real events and individuals, the film's depiction of Morrison was heavily criticized by many people who knew Morrison personally, including [[Patricia Kennealy]] and the other Doors members.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://zoraburden.weebly.com/patricia-kennealy-morrison.html |title=Patricia Kennealy Morrison |website=Zora Burden |access-date=April 12, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Broeske |first=P |date=March 10, 1991 |title=Stormy Rider |newspaper=[[Sunday Herald]]}}</ref> Former Doors keyboardist Ray Manzarek said about the film's portrayal, "It was ridiculous{{nbsp}}...

[[David Crosby]] on an album by [[CPR (band)|CPR]] wrote and recorded a song about the movie with the lyric: "And I have seen that movie – and it wasn't like that."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Morrison-lyrics-David-Crosby/D9CF2701F7AE98FA48257011000CFC9C|title=David Crosby – Morrison Lyrics|publisher=Sing365.com|date=June 23, 1998|access-date=April 16, 2014}}</ref> In general, the movie received underwhelming to poor reviews, which largely focused on the many inaccuracies and problems with the narrative. However, Val Kilmer received some praise for his performance, with some members of the Doors reportedly saying that at times they couldn't distinguish whether it was Kilmer or Morrison singing on some of the sequences.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Riordan |first=James |date=September 1996 |title=Stone: A Biography of Oliver Stone |location=New York |publisher=Aurum Pres |isbn=1-85410-444-6 |page=314}}</ref> Overall, the group members (excluding Manzarek) praised Kilmer's interpretation.<ref>{{cite web |last=Patch |first=Nick |url=http://www.680news.com/entertainment/article/72578--doors-guitarist-krieger-says-new-documentary-shows-the-real-jim-morrison |title=Krieger Interview |publisher=[[The Canadian Press]] |date=April 12, 2021}}</ref> Regardless of the widespread acclaim surrounding Kilmer's performance, he did not claim any award.<ref name="Clash" />
