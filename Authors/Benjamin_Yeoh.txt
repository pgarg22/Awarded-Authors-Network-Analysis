==Plays==

=== Lemon Love (2001) ===

'''''Lemon Love''''' is a revenge love story that involved a mystical older couple guiding and berating a younger couple in their stormy relationship.<ref>https://www.standard.co.uk/culture/theatre/a-fruitless-experience-7434661.html</ref>  Directed by [[Elizabeth Freestone]].

=== Lost in Peru (2003) ===

'''''Lost in Peru''''', was his second full length piece, first performed at the Camden People’s Theatre, London (2003). It was [[Arts Council of England]] funded.

The play dealt with torture and interwove personal tragedies with those on a larger scale particularly '[[forced disappearance|the disappeared]]' in [[Latin America]]. The UK newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'' suggested that 'while Yeoh and director Sarah Levinsky should get praise for trying to push the boundaries of form and style, both probably need reminding that there is no point in innovations and performance styles whose tricksiness threaten to bore the audience to death.'[https://www.theguardian.com/arts/critic/review/0,1169,936670,00.html]

=== Yellow Gentlemen (2006) ===

A reading of his third play called '''''Yellow Men''''', at the time (2004), was performed at the Soho Theatre and was produced by [[Yellow Earth Theatre]]. It also received Arts Council funding.

'''''Yellow Men''''' was renamed '''''Yellow Gentlemen''''' [https://web.archive.org/web/20090106183241/http://yellowgentlemen.com/] and performed at the Oval House Theatre in February - March, 2006. Time Out applauded "...the vertiginous sense of possibility and regret present in Yeoh’s intelligent script."

=== Patent Breaking Life Saving (2006) ===

'''''Patent Breaking Life Saving''''', directed by [[Jessica Dromgoole]] was broadcast by [[BBC World Service]] in December 2006. It starred Danny Sapani and [[Tanya Moodie]]. The play was about an African President who hits his head and starts giving out medicines for free.

=== The Places In Between (2007) (adaptation) ===

The story is about Rory Stewart, who walks across [[Afghanistan]] just after the fall of the [[Taliban]].<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007747g BBC – Afternoon Play – ''The Places In Between'']</ref><ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/tv_and_radio/story/0,,2013479,00.html ''Radio Pick of the Day'', The Guardian, 15 February 2007]</ref>

=== Nakamitsu (2007) ===

'''Nakamitsu''' won the international Gate Theatre Translation Award and was performed 24 May - 16 June 2007. It is a version of a Japanese [[Noh]] play.

The UK newspaper, the ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' said of Nakamitsu: ‘''Small but exquisitely formed, Benjamin Yeoh's new version of a 14th-century Japanese Noh play is fusion theatre, borrowing from east as well as west. It is both strange and familiar, accessible and remote, restrained and yet somehow full-blown.''’ [http://arts.guardian.co.uk/theatre/drama/reviews/story/0,,2095742,00.html]

=== House of Cards (2012 - 14) ===

Yeoh wrote the recorded dialogue for Coney's [http://coneyhq.org/2012/01/14/the-kensington-palace-commission/] interactive re-imagining of Kensington Palace's State apartments, called House of Cards. [https://web.archive.org/web/20141019112017/http://www.hrp.org.uk/KensingtonPalace/stories/palacehighlights/liveperformance]

=== Thinking Bigly: A Guide to Saving the World (2019 - 2021) ===

Yeoh co-wrote, with David Finnigan, and performed Thinking Bigly, a performance-lecture at Theatre Deli, London. <ref>https://stagedoorapp.com/theatre-deli-broadgate/thinking-bigly-a-guide-to-saving-the-world-12206/?p=12206</ref> and on-line versions. On reviewing, Laura Kressly wrote "Their lecture-performance amalgamates these three topics into an engaging, informative and interactive presentation that gives a wide-angle view on what we can do to save the planet."  <ref>https://theplaysthethinguk.com/2020/04/01/thinking-bigly-online/</ref>

* Yeoh has also had work on [[BBC Radio 3]] (The Inventor of Fireworks performed by [[David Yip]] on 22 January 2004) [https://www.bbc.co.uk/london/yourlondon/unitedcolours/roots/chinese_new_year2.shtml] and several readings of other works.
