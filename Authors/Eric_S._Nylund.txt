He holds a [[Bachelor's in Science|B.Sc.]] in [[chemistry]] from the University of California, Santa Barbara and an [[Master's degree|M.Sc.]] in [[chemical physics]] from the University of California, San Diego.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/delrey/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780345451323|title=Halo: The Fall of Reach|publisher=[[Del Rey Books]]|access-date=2008-04-14}}</ref> He lives in [[North Bend, Washington]] with his wife, Syne, and his son, Kai Nylund.

Nylund is the author of three novels set in the [[Halo (series)|Halo]] universe: ''[[Halo: The Fall of Reach]]'', ''[[Halo: First Strike]]'', and ''[[Halo: Ghosts of Onyx]]'', as well as a short story in ''[[Halo: Evolutions]]'' and the graphic novel ''[[Halo Wars#Release|Halo Wars: Genesis]]''. He is employed as a writer for [[Microsoft Game Studios]]. His duties include the development of [[Bible (writing)|story bibles]] and other such [[Back-story|fictional assets]], the preparation of materials for [[marketing]], and coordination with [[Microsoft]] localization, legal, and geopolitical departments.

In the 1990s he was hired by Microsoft to help rewrite and edit portions of Microsoft's multi-media encyclopedia. Since then, he has written several novels based on Microsoft-published games, including the aforementioned Halo novels, and ''[[Crimson Skies]]'', which was written collaboratively with Eric S. Trautmann.

Nylund has written many original novels as well, including ''Signal to Noise'', ''A Signal Shattered'' and ''Dry Water''.

He has recently finished ''All That Lives Must Die'', the sequel to ''Mortal Coils''. ''Mortal Coils'' and ''All That Lives Must Die'' are books 1 and 2 in a proposed 5 book series. Publisher [[Tor Books]] has yet to officially purchase the next novel ''What Fools These Mortals'', which is currently being written by Nylund. As of July 2013, no word has been publicly given on the status of the Mortal Coils series.
