'''John Edward Masefield''' {{Postnominals|country=UK|OM}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|eɪ|s|ˌ|f|iː|l|d|,_|ˈ|m|eɪ|z|-}}; 1 June 1878 – 12 May 1967) was an English poet and writer, and [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]] from 1930 until 1967. Among his best known works are the children's novels ''[[The Midnight Folk]]'' and ''[[The Box of Delights]]'', and the poems ''[[The Everlasting Mercy]]'' and "[[Sea-Fever]]".

==Biography==

===Early life===
Masefield was born in [[Ledbury]] in Herefordshire, to George Masefield, a solicitor, and his wife Caroline. His mother died giving birth to his sister when Masefield was six and he went to live with his aunt. His father died soon afterwards, following a mental breakdown.<ref>[http://www.jrank.org/literature/pages/9694/John-%28Edward%29-Masefield.html Masefield Biography]</ref> After an unhappy education at the [[Warwick School|King's School]] in [[Warwick]] (now known as Warwick School), where he was a boarder between 1888 and 1891, he left to board {{HMS|Conway|school ship|6}}, both to train for a life at sea and to break his addiction to reading, of which his aunt thought little. He spent several years aboard this ship, and found that he could spend much of his time reading and writing. It was aboard the ''Conway'' that Masefield's love of story-telling grew. While he was on the ship he listened to the stories told about sea lore, continued to read, and decided that he was to become a writer and story-teller himself. Masefield gives an account of life aboard the ''Conway'' in his book ''New Chum''.

 |quote  =<poem>
I must go down to the seas again, to the lonely sea and the sky,
And all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by,
And the wheel's kick and the wind's song and the white sail's shaking,
And a grey mist on the sea's face and a grey dawn breaking.

I must down to the seas again, for the call of the running tide
Is a wild call and a clear call that may not be denied;
And all I ask is a windy day with the white clouds flying,
And the flung spray and the blown spume, and the sea-gulls crying.

</poem>|source =From "Sea-Fever", in ''Salt-Water Ballads'' (1902)<ref>[https://archive.org/details/saltwaterballads00maserich ''Salt-Water Ballads'' (1902) at the Internet Archive]</ref>}}

In 1894 Masefield boarded the ''Gilcruix'', destined for Chile. This first voyage brought him the experience of sea sickness, but his record of his experiences while sailing through extreme weather shows his delight in seeing flying fish, porpoises and birds. He was awed by the beauty of nature, including a rare sighting of a [[lunar rainbow|nocturnal rainbow]], on this voyage. On reaching Chile he suffered from sunstroke and was hospitalised. He eventually returned home to England as a passenger aboard a steamship.

In 1895 Masefield returned to sea on a [[Iron-hulled sailing ship|windjammer]] destined for New York City. However, the urge to become a writer and the hopelessness of life as a sailor overtook him, and in New York he jumped ship and travelled throughout the countryside. For several months he lived as a vagrant, drifting between odd jobs, before he returned to New York City and found work as a barkeeper's assistant. Some time around Christmas 1895 he read the December edition of ''[[Truth (magazine)|Truth]]'', a New York periodical, which contained the poem "The Piper of Arll" by [[Duncan Campbell Scott]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.canadianpoetry.ca/confederation/DCScott/labour_and_the_angel.htm#piper |title=The Piper of Arll |access-date=30 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723151738/http://www.canadianpoetry.ca/confederation/DCScott/labour_and_the_angel.htm#piper |archive-date=23 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Ten years later Masefield wrote to Scott to tell him what reading that poem had meant to him:

{{quote|I had never (till that time) cared very much for poetry, but your poem impressed me deeply, and set me on fire. Since then poetry has been the one deep influence in my life, and to my love of poetry I owe all my friends, and the position I now hold.<ref>John Coldwell Adams, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20110723151750/http://www.canadianpoetry.ca/confederation/John%20Coldwell%20Adams/Confederation%20Voices/chapter%205.html Duncan Campbell Scott] ", ''Confederation Voices'', Canadian Poetry, 30 March 2011.</ref>}}

Dipping through the Tropics by the palm-green shores,
With a cargo of diamonds,

Butting through the Channel in the mad March days,

Firewood, ironware, and cheap tin trays.

</poem>|source =From "Cargoes", in ''Ballads'' (1903)<ref>[https://archive.org/details/ballads00maserich ''Ballads'' (1903) at the Internet Archive]</ref>}}

For the next two years Masefield was employed at the huge Alexander Smith carpet factory in Yonkers, New York, where long hours were expected and conditions were far from ideal. He purchased up to 20 books a week, and devoured both modern and classical literature. His interests at this time were diverse, and his reading included works by [[George du Maurier]], [[Alexandre Dumas, père|Dumas]], [[Thomas Browne]], [[William Hazlitt|Hazlitt]], [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]], [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]], and [[Robert Louis Stevenson|R. L. Stevenson]]. [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] also became very important to him during this time, as well as [[John Keats|Keats]] and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]]. Masefield returned home to England in 1897<ref>Stapleton, M; ''The Cambridge Guide to English Literature'', Cambridge University Press, 1983, p571</ref> as a passenger aboard a steamship.

When Masefield was 23 he met his future wife, Constance de la Cherois Crommelin (6 February 1867{{snd}}18 February 1960, [[Rockport, County Antrim|Rockport]], [[County Antrim]], [[Northern Ireland]]), who was 35 and of Huguenot descent and they married 23 June 1903 St. Mary, [[Bryanston Square]]. Educated in classics and [[English Literature]], and a mathematics teacher, Constance was a good match for him, despite the difference in their ages.  The couple had two children, Judith, born Isabel Judith, 28 April 1904, London died Sussex, 1 March 1988, and Lewis Crommelin, born London in 1910, killed in action, Africa, 29 May 1942.<ref>[http://ies.sas.ac.uk/cmps/Projects/Masefield/Society/jms2.htm John Masefield Society, A Biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513040102/http://ies.sas.ac.uk/cmps/Projects/Masefield/Society/jms2.htm |date=13 May 2007 }}</ref>

In 1902 Masefield was put in charge of the fine art section of the Arts and Industrial Exhibition in Wolverhampton. By then his poems were being published in periodicals and his first collection of verse, ''Salt-Water Ballads'', was published that year. It included the poem "Sea-Fever".  Masefield then wrote two novels, ''Captain Margaret'' (1908) and ''Multitude and Solitude'' (1909).  In 1911, after a long period of writing no poems, he composed ''[[The Everlasting Mercy]]'', the first of his [[Narrative poetry|narrative poems]], and within the next year had produced two more, "The Widow in the Bye Street" and "Dauber".  As a result, he became widely known to the public and was praised by the critics. In 1912 he was awarded the annual Edmond de Polignac Prize.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.publishingcentral.com/masefield/biography.html |title=Self-published Blog on Masefield Biog |access-date=21 March 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060423162114/http://www.publishingcentral.com/masefield/biography.html |archive-date=23 April 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

[[File:JohnMasefield1912.jpg|thumbnail|1912]]

===From the First World War to appointment as Poet Laureate===
When the First World War began in 1914 Masefield was old enough to be exempted from military service, but he joined the staff of a British hospital for French soldiers, the [[Hôpital Temporaire d'Arc-en-Barrois]] in Haute-Marne,  serving briefly in 1915 as a hospital orderly. He later published an account of his experiences.  At about this time Masefield moved his country retreat from Buckinghamshire to Lollingdon Farm in [[Cholsey]], Berkshire, a setting that inspired a number of poems and sonnets under the title ''Lollingdon Downs'', and which his family used until 1917.

After returning home Masefield was invited to the United States on a three-month lecture tour.  Although his primary purpose was to lecture on English literature, he also intended to collect information on the mood and views of Americans regarding the war in Europe.  When he returned to England he submitted a report to the [[British Foreign Office]] and suggested that he should be allowed to write a book about the failure of the Allied effort in the [[Battle of Gallipoli|Dardanelles]] that might be used in the United States to counter German propaganda there. The resulting work, ''[[Gallipoli (book by John Masefield)|Gallipoli]]'', was a success. Masefield then met the head of [[Directorate of Military Intelligence (United Kingdom)|British Military Intelligence]] in France and was asked to write an account of the [[Battle of the Somme]].  Although Masefield had grand ideas for his book, he was denied access to official records and what was intended to be the preface was published as ''The Old Front Line'', a description of the geography of the Somme area.

In 1918 Masefield returned to America on his second lecture tour, spending much of his time speaking and lecturing to American soldiers waiting to be sent to Europe.  These speaking engagements were very successful. On one occasion a battalion of [[African-American history#World War I|black]] soldiers danced and sang for him after his lecture.  During this tour he matured as a public speaker and realised his ability to touch the emotions of his audience with his style of speaking, learning to speak publicly from his own heart rather than from dry scripted speeches.  Towards the end of his visit both [[Yale]] and [[Harvard]] Universities conferred honorary doctorates of letters on him.

Masefield entered the 1920s as an accomplished and respected writer. His family was able to settle on [[Boar's Hill]], a somewhat rural setting not far from [[Oxford]], where Masefield took up [[beekeeping]], goat-herding and poultry-keeping. He continued to meet with success: the first edition of his ''Collected Poems'' (1923) sold about 80,000 copies. A narrative poem, ''Reynard The Fox'' (1920), has been critically compared with works by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], not necessarily to Masefield's credit.<ref>{{cite book | last = Murry | first = J.

After ''King Cole'', Masefield turned away from long poems and back to novels. Between 1924 and 1939 he published 12 novels, which vary from stories of the sea (''The Bird of Dawning'', ''Victorious Troy'') to social novels about modern England (''The Hawbucks'', ''The Square Peg''), and from tales of an imaginary land in Central America (''Sard Harker'', ''Odtaa'') to fantasies for children (''The Midnight Folk'', ''The Box of Delights''). In this same period he wrote a large number of dramatic pieces. Most of these were based on Christian themes, and Masefield, to his amazement, encountered a ban on the performance of plays on biblical subjects that went back to the Reformation and had been revived a generation earlier to prevent production of Oscar Wilde's Salome. However, a compromise was reached and in 1928 his "The Coming of Christ" was the first play to be performed in an English cathedral since the Middle Ages.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.publishingcentral.com/masefield/biography.html |title=Self-published Blog on Masefield Biog – middle life  |access-date=21 March 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060423162114/http://www.publishingcentral.com/masefield/biography.html |archive-date=23 April 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Encouraging the speaking of verse===

In 1921 Masefield gave the British Academy's Shakespeare Lecture<ref>{{cite web|title=Shakespeare Lectures|website=The British Academy|url=https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/events/lectures/listings/shakespeare-lectures/}}</ref> and received an honorary doctorate of literature from the University of Oxford. In 1923 he organised [[Oxford Recitations]], an annual contest whose purpose was "to discover good speakers of verse and to encourage 'the beautiful speaking of poetry'." Given the numbers of contest applicants, the event's promotion of natural speech in poetical recitations, and the number of people learning how to listen to poetry, Oxford Recitations was generally deemed a success. Masefield was similarly a founding member, in 1924, of the [[Scottish Association for the Speaking of Verse]]. He later came to question whether the Oxford events should continue as a contest, considering that they might better be run as a festival. However, in 1929, after he broke with the competitive element, Oxford Recitations came to an end. The Scottish Association for the Speaking of Verse, on the other hand, continued to develop through the influence of associated figures such as [[Marion Angus]] and [[Hugh MacDiarmid]] and exists today as the [[Poetry Association of Scotland]].

===Later years and death===
In 1930, on the death of [[Robert Bridges]], a new [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]] was needed. On the recommendation of the Prime Minister, [[Ramsay MacDonald]], [[George V|King George V]] appointed Masefield, who remained in the post until his death in 1967. The only person to hold the office for a longer period was [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]]. On his appointment ''[[The Times]]'' wrote of him: "his poetry could touch to beauty the plain speech of everyday life".<ref>''The Times'', 1930.</ref> Masefield took his appointment seriously and produced a large quantity of poems for royal occasions, which were sent to ''The Times'' for publication. Masefield's modesty was shown by his inclusion of a stamped and self-addressed envelope with each submission so that the poem could be returned if it was found unacceptable. Later he was commissioned to write a poem to be set to music by the [[Master of the King's Musick]], Sir [[Edward Elgar]], and performed at the unveiling of the [[Alexandra of Denmark|Queen Alexandra]] Memorial by the King on 8 June 1932. This was the ode [[Queen Alexandra's Memorial Ode|"So many true Princesses who have gone"]].

{{Quote box |width=330px |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right
 |quote  =<poem>
'''"Sonnet"'''
Is there a great green commonwealth of Thought
Which ranks the yearly pageant, and decides
How Summer's royal progress shall be wrought,
By secret stir which in each plant abides?
Does rocking daffodil consent that she,
The snowdrop of wet winters, shall be first?
Does spotted cowslip with the grass agree
To hold her pride before the rattle burst?
And in the hedge what quick agreement goes,
When hawthorn blossoms redden to decay,
That Summer's pride shall come, the Summer's rose,
Before the flower be on the bramble spray?
Or is it, as with us, unresting strife,
And each consent a lucky gasp for life?

</poem>|source ="Sonnet", in ''The Story of a Round-House'' (1915)}}

After his appointment Masefield was awarded the [[Order of Merit]] by King George V and many honorary degrees from British universities. In 1937 he was elected President of the [[Society of Authors]]. Masefield encouraged the continued development of English literature and poetry, and began the annual awarding of the [[Royal Medals for Poetry]] for a first or second published edition of poems by a poet under the age of 35.  Additionally, his speaking engagements called him further away, often on much longer tours, yet he still produced significant amounts of work in a wide variety of genres. To those he had already used he now added autobiography, producing ''New Chum'', ''In the Mill'', and ''So Long to Learn''.

It was not until he was about 70 that Masefield slowed his pace, mainly due to illness.  In 1960 Constance died aged 93, after a long illness. Although her death was heartrending, he had spent a tiring year watching the woman he loved die. He continued his duties as Poet Laureate. ''In Glad Thanksgiving'', his last book, was published when he was 88 years old.

In late 1966 Masefield developed gangrene in his ankle. This spread to his leg and he died of the infection on 12 May 1967. In accordance with his stated wishes, he was cremated and his ashes were placed in [[Poets' Corner]] in [[Westminster Abbey]]. However, the following verse by Masefield was discovered later, addressed to his "Heirs, Administrators, and Assigns":

{{quote|<poem>
Let no religious rite be done or read
In any place for me when I am dead,
But burn my body into ash, and scatter
The ash in secret into running water,
Or on the windy down, and let none see;
And then thank God that there's an end of me.

</poem>}}

The Masefield Centre at [[Warwick School]], which Masefield attended, and [[John Masefield High School]] in Ledbury, Herefordshire, have been named in his honour. In 1977 [[Folkways Records]] released an album of readings of some of his poems, including some read by Masefield himself.<ref>[http://www.folkways.si.edu/albumdetails.aspx?itemid=1739 ''John Masefield Reads His Poetry'']</ref>

==Song settings==
In addition to the commission for [[Queen Alexandra's Memorial Ode]] with music by Elgar, many of Masefield's short poems were set as [[art song]]s by British composers of the time.<ref>For a list of settings, see: [http://www.lieder.net/lieder/m/masefield/ 'John Masefield'] at ''The Lied, Art Song, and Choral Texts Archive'', www.recmusic.org.

==Humour==

[[E.V. Knox]] wrote a parody of "The Everlasting Mercy" called "The Everlasting Percy" about various forms of misbehaviour on the railway. It contains such thoughts as:

When I was young I was so wicked,

I used to ride without a ticket,

And travelled underneath the seat

Down in the dust of people's feet....

I have a flapper on the carrier.

Some day I'm going to marry her.
