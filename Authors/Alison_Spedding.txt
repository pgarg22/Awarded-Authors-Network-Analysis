'''Alison Louise Spedding''' (born 22 January 1962 - Belper, England) is a British [[anthropology|anthropologist]] and fantasy author.

Spedding studied [[archaeology]] and [[anthropology]] and later philosophy at [[King's College, Cambridge]], receiving her BA degree in 1982. She received a PhD from the [[London School of Economics]] in 1989. She wrote a trilogy of fantasy novels, set approximately in the time of [[Alexander the Great]]. In the novels, Alexander dies, and the female protagonist, ''Aleizon Ailix Ayndra'', goes on to fulfil Alexander's destiny.

In 1989, Spedding moved to [[Bolivia]] and lectured at [[San Andres University]] in [[La Paz]]. While there she published the academic work ''Wachu Wachu. Cultivo de coca e identidad en los Yungas de la Paz'' (1994) and Kausachun-Coca (2004). She is the author of three novels in Spanish: ''Manuel y Fortunato. Una picaresca andina'' (1997), ''El viento de la cordillera'' (2001), and the sci-fi, anarcho-feminist novel ''De cuando en cuando Saturnina'' (2004). She is also the author of a book of short stories, ''El tiempo, la distancia, otros amantes'' (1994) and the play ''Un gato en el tejar,'' the latter published under the pseudonym Alicia Céspedes Ballet. In Bolivia she became an outspoken critic of the government's policy of cracking down on peasant [[coca]] farmers. In May 1998 her La Paz flat was raided and she was arrested on drugs charges, and sentenced to ten years in prison. Academics widely considered the arrest was politically motivated and campaigned for her release. She was released in 2000 on payment of a surety.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/oct/04/bolivia|title=Bolivia bails Briton jailed on drug charge|last=Bellos|first=Alex|date=2000-10-04|website=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-05-30}}</ref>
