== Biography ==
Hannibal Hamlin Garland was born on a farm near [[West Salem, Wisconsin]], on September 14, 1860, the second of four children of Richard Garland of [[Maine]] and Charlotte Isabelle McClintock.<ref>McCullough, Joseph B. ''Hamlin Garland''. Twayne Publishers, Inc. (1978): 13.</ref> The boy was named after [[Hannibal Hamlin]], the vice-president under [[Abraham Lincoln]].<ref>Newlin, Keith. ''Hamlin Garland: A Life''. [[University of Nebraska]] Press (2008): 12. {{ISBN|978-0-8032-3347-8}}</ref> He lived on various Midwestern farms throughout his young life, but settled in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], in 1884 to pursue a career in writing.

He read diligently in the [[Boston Public Library]].<ref name=eb>{{Cite EB1922|wstitle=Garland, Hamlin}}</ref> There he became enamored with the ideas of [[Henry George]], and his Single Tax Movement.<ref name="Garland1998">{{cite book |last=Garland |first=Hamlin |title=Selected Letters of Hamlin Garland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2wNNcxHMLWwC&pg=PA325|year=1998|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=0-8032-2160-6|page=325}}</ref> George's ideas came to influence a number of his works, such as ''[[Main-Travelled Roads]]'' (1891),  ''Prairie Folks'' (1892), and his novel ''[[Jason Edwards: An Average Man|Jason Edwards]]'' (1892).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/nye-russel_hamlin-garland-and-henry-george-1943.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-01-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203135043/http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/nye-russel_hamlin-garland-and-henry-george-1943.html |archive-date=2014-02-03 }}</ref>

''Main-Travelled Roads'' was his first major success. It was a collection of short stories inspired by his days on the farm. He serialized a biography of [[Ulysses S. Grant]] in ''[[McClure's Magazine]]'' before publishing it as a book in 1898. The same year, Garland traveled to the [[Yukon]] to witness the [[Klondike Gold Rush]], which inspired ''The Trail of the Gold Seekers'' (1899). He lived on a farm between [[Osage, Iowa|Osage]], and [[St. Ansgar, Iowa]] for quite some time. Many of his writings are based on this era of his life.

In 1893,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://chicagoscots.net/Great%20Scots/Garland,%20Hamlin.htm | title = Hamlin Garland, 1860-1940 | work = Scottish American History Club | first = Wayne | last = Rethford | date = n.d. | publisher = Illinois Saint Andrew Society | access-date = August 9, 2020}}</ref> Hamlin moved to Chicago, where he lived at 6427 South Greenwood Avenue in the [[Woodlawn, Chicago|Woodlawn]] neighborhood. He is considered "a significant figure in the Chicago Literary Movement" and "one of Chicago's most important authors".<ref name=MoccasinRanchPark /> Moccasin Ranch Park, located near address, is named in his honor.<ref name=MoccasinRanchPark>{{cite web | url = https://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/parks-facilities/moccasin-ranch-park-0 | title = Moccasin Ranch Park | work = The Official Website of the Chicago Park District | publisher = Chicago Park District | access-date = August 9, 2020}}</ref>

In Illinois, Garland married [[Zulime Taft]], the sister of sculptor [[Lorado Taft]], and began working as a teacher and a lecturer.<ref>Charles Rounds (ed.). ''[http://www.library.wisc.edu/etext/wireader/WER0051-1.html Wisconsin Authors and Their Works] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426120105/http://www.library.wisc.edu/etext/WIReader/WER0051-1.html |date=2014-04-26 }}''. Madison, Wis.: Parker Educational, 1918.</ref>

A prolific writer, Garland continued to publish novels, short fiction, and essays. In 1917, he published his autobiography, ''A Son of the Middle Border''. The book's success prompted a sequel, ''A Daughter of the Middle Border'', for which Garland won the 1922 [[Pulitzer Prize]] for Biography. After two more volumes, Garland began a second series of memoirs based on his diary. Garland naturally became quite well known during his lifetime and had many friends in literary circles.<ref>See, ''e.g.'', his association with [[Frank Lebby Stanton#Notes|Frank Lebby Stanton]].</ref> He was made a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] in 1918.<ref name=eb/>

After moving to [[Hollywood, California]], in 1929, he devoted his remaining years to investigating [[parapsychology|psychic phenomena]], an enthusiasm he first undertook in 1891. In his final book, ''The Mystery of the Buried Crosses'' (1939), he tried to defend such phenomena and prove the legitimacy of psychic mediums.

A friend, [[Lee Shippey]], columnist for the ''Los Angeles Times,'' recalled Garland's regular system of writing:

<blockquote>. . . he got up at half past five, brewed a pot of coffee and made toast on an electric gadget in his study and was at work by six. At nine o'clock he was through with work for the day. Then he breakfasted, read the morning paper and attended to his personal mail. . . . After luncheon he and Mrs. Garland would take a long drive . . . . Sometimes they would drop in on [[Will Rogers]], [[Will Durant]], [[Robert Benchley]] or even on me, for their range of friends was very wide. . . . After dinner they would go to a show if an exceptionally good one were in town, otherwise one of their daughters would read aloud.<ref>Lee Shippey, ''Luckiest Man Alive,'' Los Angeles: Westernlore Press (1959), pages 178, 179</ref></blockquote>

Garland died at age 79, at his home in Hollywood<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archives.usc.edu/repositories/3/resources/198 |title=Hamlin Garland and the University of Southern California |work=The Hamlin Garland Collection |publisher=University of Southern California Libraries, Special Collections Department |access-date=June 7, 2010 }}</ref> on March 4, 1940. A memorial service was held three days later near his home in [[Glendale, California]].<ref>Newlin, Keith. ''Hamlin Garland: A Life''. [[University of Nebraska]] Press (2008): 2. {{ISBN|978-0-8032-3347-8}}</ref> His ashes were buried in Neshonoc Cemetery in West Salem, Wisconsin, on March 14; his poem "The Cry of the Age" was read by Reverend John B. Fritz.<ref>Newlin, Keith. ''Hamlin Garland: A Life''. [[University of Nebraska]] Press (2008): 1. {{ISBN|978-0-8032-3347-8}}</ref>

The [[Hamlin Garland House]] in West Salem was designated as a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1971.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1061&ResourceType=Building|title=Hamlin Garland House|access-date=2008-01-02|work=National Historic Landmark summary listing|publisher=National Park Service|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403221920/http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1061&ResourceType=Building|archive-date=2009-04-03|df=}}</ref>
