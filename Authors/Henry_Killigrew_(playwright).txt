==Life==
Killigrew was born in [[Hanworth]] on 11 February 1613, the fifth and youngest son of [[Robert Killigrew]] and his wife [[Mary Woodhouse]]. He was the brother of the dramatist [[Thomas Killigrew]] and of [[Elizabeth Killigrew, Viscountess Shannon]], mistress of the future [[Charles II of England|Charles II]].

He was educated at Cripplegate, London and at [[Christ Church, Oxford]], graduating [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] 1632, [[Master of Arts (Oxford, Cambridge, and Dublin)|M.A.]] 1638, [[Doctor of Divinity|D.D.]] 1642.<ref>{{cite book|last=Foster|first=Joseph|authorlink=Joseph Foster (genealogist)|title=Alumni Oxonienses: Killigrew, Henry|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/alumni-oxon/1500-1714/pp837-867|access-date=5 September 2019|year=1891}}</ref>

He served as a chaplain in [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s army during the [[English Civil War]] and was chaplain to James, Duke of York (the future [[James II of England|James II]]) during his time in exile.  He was also appointed almoner to James, Duke of York.<ref name="HK">{{cite web |title=KILLIGREW, Henry (c.1652-1712), of St. Julians, nr.

He served as a canon of [[Westminster Abbey]] in 1642 and from 1660 to his death<ref name="Family">{{cite web |title=Killigrew Family |url=https://www.westminster-abbey.org/abbey-commemorations/commemorations/killigrew-family |website=Westminster Abbey |access-date=12 April 2021}}</ref> and as rector of [[St Helen's Church, Wheathampstead|Wheathampstead]].<ref name="DNB">{{cite DNB|wstitle=Killigrew, Henry (1613-1700)|first=George Atherton|last=Aitken |authorlink=George Atherton Aitken|volume=31}}</ref>

In 1663, Henry Killigrew was appointed [[Master of the Savoy]]. According to some writers the final ruin of the Savoy Hospital was due to Killigrew's "improvidence, greed, and other bad qualities".<ref>{{cite book|last=Loftie|first=William John|date=1878|title=Memorials of the Savoy|pages=[https://archive.org/details/memorialsofsavoy00loftuoft/page/110 110]–114|place=London|publisher=Macmillan and Co|url=https://archive.org/details/memorialsofsavoy00loftuoft|access-date=4 September 2019}}</ref> A bill was passed in 1697 abolishing its privileges of sanctuary. The hospital was leased out in tenements, and the master appropriated the profits; among the leases granted was one (1699) to Henry Killigrew, the patentee of [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane Theatre]], for his lodgings in the Savoy, at a rent of 1 shilling per year for forty years.<ref name="DNB"/> A commission appointed by [[William III of England|William III]] reported that the relief of the poor (the hospital's intended purpose) was being utterly neglected.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Page|editor-first=William|date=1909|title=The Hospital of the Savoy|pages=546–549|series=A History of the County of London|volume=1|place=London|publisher=Victoria County History|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=35379|access-date=10 September 2019}}</ref> In 1702, shortly after Killigrew's death, the hospital was dissolved.

A juvenile play of his, ''The Conspiracy'', was printed surreptitiously in 1638, and in an authenticated version in 1653 as ''Pallantus and Eudora''.
