His second collection, ''How Now!''

Moore has no designs on the reader. The vignettes are presented in an almost forensic fashion, it is up to us to fill in the missing emotion, blanked by alcohol, repression, conformity."<ref>O'Loughlin, Michael (2011), [[Poetry Ireland Review]] 103, {{ISBN|1-902121-41-4}}</ref> Two of Moore's poems were included in the Dublin Poetry and Places Anthology "If Ever You Go" <ref>http://www.dedaluspress.com/p/if_ever_you_go_a_map_of_dublin_in_poetry_and_song {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407192225/http://www.dedaluspress.com/p/if_ever_you_go_a_map_of_dublin_in_poetry_and_song |date=2014-04-07 }}  {{ISBN|978 19 06614874}}</ref>
