'''Daniel Naborowski''' (1573–1640) was a [[Polish Baroque]] poet.

Daniel Naborowski was born in [[Kraków]].<ref>[http://culture.pl/pl/tworca/daniel-naborowski Daniel Naborowski's biography at Culture.pl]</ref> Like many Polish noblemen of the time, he was a Calvinist by faith. His education took place not only in Cracow, but also at [[Wittenberg]] (1590–1593) and [[Basle]] (1593–1595).<ref>[http://culture.pl/pl/tworca/daniel-naborowski Daniel Naborowski's biography at Culture.pl]</ref> In Basle he studied medicine, in [[Orléans]] he studied law, and from [[Galileo]] in [[Padua]] he learned military engineering. Once he returned to the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], he joined the court of [[magnate]] [[Janusz Radziwiłł (1579–1620)|Janusz Radziwiłł]],<ref>[http://www.staropolska.pl/barok/D_Naborowski/biogram.html Dariusz Rott, Daniel Naborowski at Staropolska.pl]</ref> where he was his secretary and physician. He was also magnate's diplomatic envoy, and often traveled abroad. After Janusz death, he moved to the court of his relative [[Krzysztof Radziwiłł]].<ref>[http://www.staropolska.pl/barok/D_Naborowski/biogram.html Dariusz Rott, Daniel Naborowski at Staropolska.pl]</ref>

He died in [[Vilna]], where near the end of his life, he was appointed the city's judge.<ref>[http://culture.pl/pl/tworca/daniel-naborowski Daniel Naborowski's biography at Culture.pl]</ref>

Although some of his works were published in the 17th century (like ''On the eyes of the English princess who was married to Frederick, the pfaltzgrave of Rhein, elected the king of Bohemia'', published in 1621), the majority of his poems were published only in 1961. Besides poems, Naborowski was a translator, and wrote letters, epitaphs, trifles and laments, mostly praising the country's peaceful life in the spirit of [[sarmatism]]. He translated three sonnets by Petrarch.<ref>See: Daniel Naborowski, Poezje wybrane. Wyboru dokonał i opracował Krzysztof Karasek, Ludowa Spółdzielnia Wydawnicza, Warszawa 1980, p. 127-129.</ref> He used in these poems [[Polish alexandrine]] instead of hendecasyllable, starting thus long tradition of writing sonnets in 13(7+5) metre.
