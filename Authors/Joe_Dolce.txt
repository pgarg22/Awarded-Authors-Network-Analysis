==Biography==
Dolce was born in 1947, the eldest of three children, to Italian-American parents, in [[Painesville, Ohio]], graduating from [[Thomas W. Harvey High School]] in 1965. During his senior year, he played the lead role of Mascarille in [[Molière]]'s "Les Précieuses Ridicules" for a production staged by the French Club of [[Lake Erie College]], which was his first time on stage, acting and singing an impromptu song he created from the script. The play was well received and his performance was noted by director Jake Rufli, who later invited him to be part of his production of [[Jean Anouilh]]'s "Eurydice".

His co-star in "Les Précieuses Ridicules" was a sophomore, on a creative writing scholarship, at [[Lake Erie College]], [[Carol Dunlop]], who introduced him to folk music, [[poetry]] and the writings of [[William Faulkner]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]]. Dunlop later married the [[Argentine]] novelist [[Julio Cortázar]]. Dolce attended [[Ohio University]], majoring in [[Architecture]], from 1965 to 1967, before deciding to become a professional [[musician]].

==Musical and theatrical career==
While attending college at [[Ohio University]], in [[Athens, Ohio]], he formed various bands including '''Headstone Circus''',<ref name="McF"/> with [[Jonathan Edwards (musician)|Jonathan Edwards]] who subsequently went on as a solo artist to have a charting hit song in the US ("[[Sunshine (Jonathan Edwards song)|Sunshine]]"). Edwards subsequently recorded five Dolce songs including, "Athens County", "Rollin' Along", "King of Hearts", "The Ballad of Upsy Daisy" and "My Home Ain't in the Hall of Fame", the latter song becoming an alt country classic, also recorded by [[Robert Earl Keen]], [[Rosalie Sorrels]], JD Crowe & the New South, and many others.

==Move to Australia==
Dolce relocated to [[Melbourne]], Australia in 1978 and his first single there was "Boat People"—a [[protest song]] on the poor treatment of Vietnamese refugees—which was translated into Vietnamese and donated to the fledgling Vietnamese community starting to form in Melbourne.  His one-man show, Joe Dolce Music Theatre, [[Musical theatre|performed]] in cabarets and pubs with various line-ups, including his longtime partner, [[Lin Van Hek]].

=="Shaddap You Face"==
In July 1980, he recorded the self-penned "[[Shaddap You Face]]",<ref name="APRA Shaddap"/> for the Full Moon Records label, at Mike Brady's new studios in [[West Melbourne, Victoria|West Melbourne]].<ref name="McF"/><ref name="Jeff"/> When in Ohio, Dolce would sometimes visit his Italian grandparents and extended family—they used the phrases "What's the matter, you?" and "Eh, shaddap", which Dolce adapted and used in the song.<ref name="Jeff"/> He wrote the song about Italians living in Australia and first performed it at Marijuana House, Brunswick Street, [[Fitzroy, Victoria|Fitzroy]] in 1979.<ref name="Jeff"/> Dolce paid [[Australian dollar|A$]]500 for the recording and spent $1000 on the music video clip, which was created by Melbourne filmmaker, [[Chris Lofven]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}
