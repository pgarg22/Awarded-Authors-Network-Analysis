'''Henry Kirke White''' (21 March 1785 – 19 October 1806) was an [[England|English]] [[poet]]. He died at the young age of 21.

==Life==
White was born in [[Nottingham]], the son of a butcher, a trade for which he was himself intended. However, he was greatly attracted to book-learning. By age seven, he was giving reading lessons (unbeknownst to the rest of the family, being offered after the household were abed) to a family servant.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kacirk, Jeffrey|title=Forgotten English|location=New York|publisher=William Morrow & Co|year=1997|isbn=0-688-15018-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/forgottenenglish00kaci}}</ref> After being briefly apprenticed to a stocking-weaver, he was articled to a lawyer, [[George Coldham]]. While in this position, he excelled in studying [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]].<ref>Kacirk 1997.</ref> When his health deteriorated due to tuberculosis, his employers gave him leave of absence for a month. He chose to live in [[Wilford]] at the crossroads, opposite Wilford House between 1804 and 1805. He drew inspiration for much of his poetry from Wilford and the surrounding area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thorotonsociety.org.uk/publications/articles/kirkewhite.htm|title = The Thoroton Society of Nottinghamshire > Henry Kirke White}}</ref>[[File:Wilford Church.jpg|300px|thumb|right|St Wilfrid's Church and Gazebo, Illustrated London News, 7 July 1888]]

He wrote many of his poems in the gazebo which stands in the grounds of [[St Wilfrid's Church, Wilford]]. Here he wrote:-

{{quote|<poem>
Here would I wish to sleep, this is the spot
Which I have long marked out to lay my bones in.
Tired out and wearied with the riotous world, 
Beneath this yew would I be sepulchred.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thorotonsociety.org.uk/publications/articles/kirkewhite.htm|title = The Thoroton Society of Nottinghamshire > Henry Kirke White}}</ref></poem>}}

Seeing the results of White's diligent studies and his deteriorating health, his master offered to release him from his contract if he had sufficient means to go to college. He received encouragement from [[Capel Lofft]], the friend of [[Robert Bloomfield]], and published in 1803, aged 17,''Clifton Grove, a Sketch in Verse, with other Poems'', dedicated to [[Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire]]. One of the better known ones was ‘The Fair Maid of Clifton’ and another was ‘Clifton Grove’ in which were the controversial lines:-

{{quote|<poem>
Or, where the town’s blue turrets dimly rise,
And manufacture taints the ambient skies,
The pale mechanic leaves the lab’ring loom,
The air-pent hold, the pestilential room,
And rushes out, impatient to begin
The stated course of customary sin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thorotonsociety.org.uk/publications/articles/kirkewhite.htm|title = The Thoroton Society of Nottinghamshire > Henry Kirke White}}</ref></poem>}}

The book was violently attacked in the ''Monthly Review'' (February 1804), but White was rewarded with a kind letter from [[Robert Southey]].

Through the efforts of his friends, he was able to enter [[St John's College, Cambridge]],<ref>{{acad|id=WHT804HK|name=White, Henry Kirke}}</ref><ref>''His fondest hopes were realized. In October 1805, he went to Cambridge where, by unexampled industry, he speedily attained distinction...'' (Robert Chambers, ''Book of Days'' [1864])</ref> having spent a year beforehand with a private tutor, the Rev. Lorenzo Grainger, at [[Winteringham]], Lincolnshire. Close application to study induced a serious illness, [[tuberculosis|consumption]] was the disease, according to Sir Harris Nicholas's memoir, to which he ultimately became a victim, and to which White made many allusions in his poems and letters.<ref>Memoir by Sir Harris Nicolas in The Poetical Works and Remains of Henry Kirke White, G Routledge, London 1835</ref> [[File:Plaque marking the birthplace of Henry Kirke White.jpg|140px|thumb|right|Plaque marking Kirke White's Birthplace]]Fears were also entertained for his sanity, but he went into residence at [[Cambridge]], with a view to taking holy orders, in the autumn of 1805. The strain of continuous study quickly worsened his already deteriorating health resulting in his death.<ref>''But he had long overtaxed his strength. At the end of one short year ... exhausted nature sank beneath incessant toil and anxiety'' (Chambers 1864).</ref>

He was buried in the church of [[All Saints Church, Cambridge|All Saints' Jewry]], Cambridge, which stood opposite the gates of St John's College, but has since been demolished. The genuine piety of his religious verses secured a place in popular hymnology for some of his hymns, in particular the still popular ''O Lord, another day is flown''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=tLwYAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA698&lpg=PA698&dq=O+lord+another+day+has+flown+hymn&source=bl&ots=TMpi-5thf5&sig=LwM7YAErZsg_zeDSyZdIVnFHg5A&hl=en&sa=X&ei=s5TbUu_LA9DwhQeC34DwBA&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=O%20lord%20another%20day%20has%20flown%20hymn&f=false google.co.uk/books]</ref> Much of his fame was due to sympathy inspired by his early death; but [[Lord Byron]] agreed with Southey about the young man's promise. [[Robert Southey]] said of him: "...he could not rest satisfied till he had formed his principles upon the basis of [[Christianity]]."<ref>Prefatory Note, ''The Poetical Works and Remains'' Routledge, London 1835</ref>

A metal plaque can be seen in [[Nottingham Council House|Exchange Arcade, Cheapside]] in Nottingham, on the site of Kirke White's birthplace. Originally a Holbrook plaque was erected on the actual dwelling but was removed when that was demolished prior to the erection of the Council House.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thorotonsociety.org.uk/publications/articles/kirkewhite.htm|title = The Thoroton Society of Nottinghamshire > Henry Kirke White}}</ref>

[[St Wilfrid's Church, Wilford]] contains two memorials. One is a marble plaque inside the nave, the second is a memorial stained glass window, c1870, by O'Connor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://southwellchurches.nottingham.ac.uk/wilford-st-wilfrid/hlisting.php|title = Wilford St Wilfrid - Official Listing Description}}</ref>

==Literary legacy==
His ''Remains'', with his letters (which along with White's poems contain many allusions to himself that they may almost be considered an autobiography<ref>Memoir by [[Nicholas Harris Nicolas|Sir Harris Nicolas]] in ''The Poetical Works and Remains of Henry Kirke White'',  G Routledge, London 1835</ref>) and an account of his life, were edited (5 vols., 1807–1822) by Robert Southey.<ref>''The Poetical Works and Remains of Henry Kirke White'',  G Routledge, London 1835</ref> See prefatory notices by [[Nicholas Harris Nicolas|Sir Harris Nicolas]] to his ''Poetical Works'' (new ed., 1866) in the [[Aldine Press]] ''British poets''; by Harry Kirke Swann in the volume of selections (1897) in the ''Canterbury Poets''; and by [[John Drinkwater (playwright)|John Drinkwater]] to the edition in the "Muses' Library." See also John Thomas Godfrey and J. Ward, ''The Homes and Haunts of Henry Kirke White'' (1908). [[Lord Byron]] said of White in a tributary eulogy 'while life was in its spring, thy young muse just waved her joyous wing'.<ref>Tributary Verse, The Poetical Works of Henry Kirke White, Pickering, London 1855</ref> White's  complete works were published in 1923.<ref>''The Complete Works of Henry Kirke White'', 1923 edition  Nabu Press, London {{ISBN|9781172255078}}</ref>
