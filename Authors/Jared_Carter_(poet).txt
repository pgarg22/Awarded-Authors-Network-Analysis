'''Jared Carter''' (born January 10, 1939) is an [[United States|American]] poet and editor.

==Life==
Carter was born in a small Midwestern town that is noted for having been the birthplace of [[Wendell Willkie]], the Republican presidential candidate in 1940. Carter grew up in the shadow of this liberal Republican dark horse who lost the election to the incumbent Roosevelt, but who supported the president in calls for preparedness while storm clouds were gathering over Europe. 

Carter lettered in three sports in high school and still holds his school's record for the [[400 meter dash]]. Following graduation in 1956, he attended [[Yale]] and, in later years, [[Goddard College]]. At Yale he majored in English literature; at Goddard, American history.

After military service and travel abroad in the 1960s, he made his home in [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]], where he has lived since 1969. He worked for many years as an editor and interior designer of textbooks and scholarly works, first with the [[Bobbs-Merrill Company]] and later in association with [[Hackett Publishing Company]].

He is a fifth-generation Hoosier, descended from anti-slavery North Carolinians and Virginians who migrated to Indiana in the decades following its establishment in 1816 as the nineteenth state. Several of his poems include details taken from the letters, journals, and family stories of his predecessors.
 
Among forebears on his mother's side was Elias Baxter Decker, of [[Tipton County, Indiana]], who fought at [[Tullahoma Campaign|Tullahoma]], [[Battle of Chickamauga|Chickamauga]], and [[Battle of Missionary Ridge|Missionary Ridge]], and who served with the [[75th Indiana Infantry Regiment]] in the army led by [[William Tecumseh Sherman]], on its [[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]] from Atlanta to Savannah and points north, in 1864-65.

During the Second World War, Carter's father, Robert A. Carter, served with the [[Seabees]]  from 1943 to 1945, and took part in the construction of airstrips for B-29s on the Island of [[Tinian]] in the [[Marianas]].  Carter's father-in-law, David P. Haston, was a technician with a [[B-17]] flight wing in the Pacific during that conflict, serving from 1941 to 1945.  For his participation in the [[Battle of Midway]] he was awarded three bronze stars.

On his father's side, Carter is a grand-nephew of the American artist Glen Cooper Henshaw.

==Poetry==
Carter writes in [[free verse]] and in traditional forms. Much of his early work is set in "Mississinewa County", an imaginary place that includes the actual [[Mississinewa River]], a tributary of the [[Wabash River]]. In recent years, as he has published increasingly on the web, his poetry has ranged farther afield.

His poems have appeared in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[The Nation]]'', ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]],'' and other journals in the U.S. and abroad. His work has been anthologized in ''Twentieth-Century American Poetry,''<ref>New York: McGraw-Hill, 2003. Compiled by Dana Gioia, David Mason, and Meg Schoerke.  {{ISBN|978-0-07-240019-9}}.</ref> ''Contemporary American Poetry,'' <ref>New York: Penguin Academics Series, 2005. Compiled by R. S. Gwynn and April Lindner.  {{ISBN|978-0-321-18282-1}}.</ref> ''Writing Poems,''<ref>New York: Longman, 2004.

Edited by Edward Byrne. {{ISBN|978-1-931-24786-3}}.</ref>

His first collection, ''Work, for the Night Is Coming'' (1981), won the [[List of winners of the Walt Whitman Award|Walt Whitman Award]]. His second, ''After the Rain'' (1993), was given the [[Poets' Prize]]. He has received two literary fellowships from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://arts.endow.gov/pub/NEA_lit.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916053135/http://arts.endow.gov/pub/NEA_lit.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-16 }}</ref> a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]],<ref>https://www.gf.org/fellows/all-fellows/jared-carter/</ref> and the Indiana Governor's Arts Award.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/arts/2520.htm|title=Arts: Governor's Arts Awards - Past Recipients|website=www.in.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-13}}</ref>
