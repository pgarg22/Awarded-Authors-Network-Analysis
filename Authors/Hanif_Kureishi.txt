'''Hanif Kureishi''', [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (born 5 December 1954) is a British playwright, screenwriter, filmmaker and novelist of Pakistani and English descent.<ref Name=Times/> In 2008, ''[[The Times]]'' included Kureishi in its list of The 50 greatest [[British literature|British writers]] since 1945.<ref>[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article3127837.ece The 50 greatest British writers since 1945]. 5 January 2008. ''[[The Times]]''. Retrieved 20 February 2010.</ref>

==Early life==
Kureishi was born in [[Bromley]], South London to a Pakistani father, Rafiushan (Shanoo) Kureishi, and an English mother, Audrey Buss.<ref Name=Times/><ref Name=McCrum /><ref name=Ballou>[[Emily Ballou]], [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/features/whims-of-the-father/story-e6frg8h6-1111118058817 "Whims of the father"], ''The Australian'', 15 November 2008.</ref> His father was from a wealthy [[Madras]] family, most of whose members moved to Pakistan after the [[Partition of British India]] in 1947. Rafiushan came to the UK in 1950<ref>{{cite web|last1=Creative media|first1=Five on a bike|title=Interview - Hanif Kureishi in conversation with Kenan Malik|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixQDEJ7CocE|website=youtube.com|publisher=You Tube|access-date=19 December 2014}}</ref> to study law but due to financial reasons he worked at the Pakistani embassy instead.<ref name=Ballou /> Here he met his wife-to-be, Buss. He wanted to be a writer but his ambitions were frustrated.<ref Name=McCrum /> The couple were married, the family settled in Bromley where Kureishi was born. In an interview, Kureishi notes:<blockquote>My [paternal] grandfather, an army doctor, was a colonel in the [[Indian Army|Indian army]]. Big family. [[Domestic worker|Servants]]. [[Tennis court]]. [[Cricket]]. Everything. My father went to the Cathedral School that [[Salman Rushdie]] went to. Later, in Pakistan, my family were close to the [[Bhutto family|Bhuttos]]. My uncle [[Omar Kureishi|Omar]] was a newspaper columnist and the manager of the Pakistan cricket team...My grandfather, the colonel, was terrifying. A hard-living, [[Alcoholism|hard-drinking]] gambler. [[Womanizing|Womanising]]. Around him it was like ''[[The Godfather]]''. They drank and they gossiped. The women would come and go.<ref Name=McCrum /></blockquote>

Hanif Kureishi attended Bromley Technical High School and studied for A-levels at Bromley College of Technology.<ref Name=college>[http://hanifkureishi.co.uk/the-author/ Official website]; accessed 14 January 2016.</ref> While at this college, he was elected as student union president (1972) and some of the characters from his semi-autobiographical work ''The Buddha of Suburbia'' are from this period. He went on to spend a year studying philosophy at [[Lancaster University]], then withdrew.<ref Name=college/> Later he attended [[King's College London]] and earned a degree in philosophy.<ref Name=college/>

==Career==
Kureishi started his career in the 1970s as a pornography writer,<ref>''The New York Times'', 10 August 2008.</ref><ref>Interview with Hanif Kureishi, ''The Book Show'', Episode 18, Sky Arts.</ref> under the pseudonyms Antonia French<ref>{{cite web |url=https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/postcolonialstudies/2014/06/11/kureishi-hanif/ |title= Kureishi, Hanif |first= Surbhi |last= Sharma |date=July 2012  |editor=Postcolonial Studies Website of English Department |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406134205/https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/postcolonialstudies/2014/06/11/kureishi-hanif/ |archive-date=6 April 2015 |url-status=live |access-date=6 April 2015 }}</ref> and Karim.<ref>Nahem Yousaf. ''Hanif Kureishi's The Buddha of Suburbia: a reader's guide'', p. 8.</ref> He went on to write plays for the [[Hampstead Theatre]], [[Soho Theatre|Soho Poly]], and by the age of 18, was with the [[Royal Court Theatre|Royal Court]].<ref Name=McCrum /> He wrote ''[[My Beautiful Laundrette]]'' in 1985, a screenplay about a gay Pakistani-British boy growing up in 1980s London for a film directed by [[Stephen Frears]]. The screenplay, especially the racial discrimination experienced, contained elements from Hanif's experiences as the only Pakistani student in his class at school. It won the New York City Film Critics Best Screenplay Award and an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]. He also wrote the screenplay for ''[[Sammy and Rosie Get Laid]]'' (1987). His book ''[[The Buddha of Suburbia (novel)|The Buddha of Suburbia]]'' (1990) won the [[Whitbread Book Awards|Whitbread Award]] for the best first novel and was made into [[The Buddha of Suburbia (TV serial)|a BBC television series]] with [[The Buddha of Suburbia (soundtrack)|a soundtrack]] by [[David Bowie]]. 1991 saw the release of the feature film titled ''[[London Kills Me]]'', written and directed by Kureishi.

His novel ''[[Intimacy (novel)|Intimacy]]'' (1998) revolved around the story of a man leaving his wife and two young sons after feeling physically and emotionally rejected by his wife. This created some controversy as Kureishi recently had left his own partner (the editor and producer Tracey Scoffield) and two young sons; it was assumed to be at least semi-autobiographical. In 2000/2001, the novel was adapted into the film ''[[Intimacy (2001 film)|Intimacy]]'' by [[Patrice Chéreau]], which won two Bears at the [[Berlin Film Festival]]: a [[Golden Bear]] for Best Film and a [[Silver Bear for Best Actress]] ([[Kerry Fox]]). It was controversial for its explicit sex scenes. The book was translated into Persian by [[Niki Karimi]] in 2005.

Kureishi's drama ''[[The Mother (2003 film)|The Mother]]'' was adapted to a movie by [[Roger Michell]], which won a joint First Prize in the [[Director’s Fortnight]] section at [[Cannes Film Festival]]. It showed a cross-generational relationship with changed roles: a 70-year-old English lady and grandmother (played by [[Anne Reid]]) who seduces her daughter's boyfriend (played by [[Daniel Craig]]), a 30-year-old craftsman. Explicit sex scenes were shown in realistic drawings only, thus avoiding censorship. He wrote the 2006 screenplay ''[[Venus (2006 film)|Venus]]'', and for his performance in this movie, Peter O'Toole received Oscar, BAFTA, Screen Actors Guild, Broadcast Film Critics Association and Golden Globe nominations in the best actor category.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

A novel titled ''Something to Tell You'' was published in 2008. His 1995 novel ''The Black Album'', adapted for the theatre, was performed at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] in July and August 2009. In May 2011, he was awarded the second Asia House Literature Award on the closing night of the Asia House Literary Festival where he discussed his ''Collected Essays'' (Faber).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.diplomatmagazine.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=434&Itemid= |title=Asia House|first=April |last=Gow |work=Diplomat Magazine |access-date=6 June 2013}}</ref>

Kureishi has written non-fiction, including autobiography. As noted by Cathy Galvin in ''The Telegraph'': "But at the core of his life, as described in his memoir ''My Ear at His Heart'' is Kureishi’s relationship with his father, Rafiushan, who died in 1991."<ref>Cathy Galvin, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/9722077/Hanif-Kureishi-the-pariah-of-suburbia.html "Hanif Kureishi: the pariah of suburbia"], ''The Telegraph'', 13 December 2012.</ref>

==Personal life==
Kureishi has twin boys (from his relationship with film producer Tracey Scoffield<ref>{{cite news|first1=Katie|last1=Law|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/hanif-kureishi-i-had-to-write-about-the-theft-it-was-all-that-was-left-to-me-10295457.html |title=I had to write about the theft — it was all that was left to me| newspaper=The London Evening Standard|date=3 June 2015}}</ref>) and a younger son. Kureishi currently lives in West London.<ref Name=McCrum>[[Robert McCrum]], [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/19/hanif-kureishi-interview-last-word "Hanif Kureishi interview: 'Every 10 years you become someone else'"], ''The Observer'', 19 January 2014.</ref><ref Name=college/> He was appointed [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in the [[New Year Honours 2008|2008 New Year Honours]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cccb.org/en/participants/file/hanif-kureishi/229475|title=Hanif Kureishi|website=[[Centre de Cultura Contemporània de Barcelona]]|access-date=2018-09-16}}</ref> In 2013, Kureishi lost his life savings, intended to cover "the ups and downs of being a writer", in a suspected fraud.<ref>{{cite news|first1=Miles|last1=Brignall|first2=Rupert|last2=Jones|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/may/03/hanif-kureishi-victim-suspected-fraud|title=Author Hanif Kureishi loses life savings to suspected fraud|newspaper=The Guardian|date=3 May 2013}}</ref> Although he acknowledges his father's Pakistani roots (originating in [[Madras]], in British India, present-day Chennai, India), he rarely visits Pakistan. Upon a 2012 visit sponsored by the [[British Council]], he acknowledged that it was his first trip to Pakistan in 20 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/9722077/Hanif-Kureishi-the-pariah-of-suburbia.html|title=Hanif Kureishi: the pariah of suburbia|first=Cathy|last=Galvin|date=13 December 2012|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref>

Kureishi's family have accused him of exploiting them with thinly disguised references in his work; Kureishi has denied the claims. His sister Yasmin has accused him of selling her family "down the line". She wrote, in a letter to ''[[The Guardian]]'', that if her family's history had to become public, she would not stand by and let it be "fabricated for the entertainment of the public or for Hanif's profit".<ref Name=McCrum /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pw.org/content/author039s_sister_writes_next_chapter_kureishi_family_feud |title=Author's Sister Writes Next Chapter in Kureishi Family Feud |publisher= Poets & Writers |date=11 March 2008 |access-date=6 June 2013}}</ref> She says that his description of her family's working-class roots are fictitious. Their grandfather was not "cloth cap working class", their mother never worked in a shoe factory, and their father, she says, was not a bitter old man. Yasmin takes issues with her brother for his thinly disguised autobiographical references in his first novel ''The Buddha of Suburbia'' as well as for the image of his own past that he portrays in newspaper interviews. She wrote: "My father was angry when ''The Buddha of Suburbia'' came out as he felt that Hanif had robbed him of his dignity, and he didn't speak to Hanif for about a year."<ref Name=McCrum /> Kureishi and his father did not speak for many months during the controversy.<ref Name=McCrum /> There was further furor with the publication of ''Intimacy'' as the story was assumed to be autobiographical.<ref Name=McCrum /><ref Name=college/>

In 2013, Kureishi was appointed as a professor in the creative writing department at [[Kingston University]] in London, where he was a writer in residence.<ref Name=Times>[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/people/qa-with-hanif-kureishi/2008915.article "Q&A with Hanif Kureishi"], ''The Times Higher Educational Supplement'', 14 November 2013.</ref> However, at [[Bath Literature Festival|''The Independent'' Bath Literature Festival]], 2 March 2014, he stated that creative writing courses were a "waste of time" and commented that 99.9% of his students were talentless.<ref>''The Independent'', 3 March 2014.</ref> In 2014, the [[British Library]] announced that it would be acquiring the archive of Kureishi's documents spanning 40 years of his writing life. The body of work will include diaries, notebooks and drafts.<ref>[http://www.bl.uk/whatson/events/event156434.html "Hanif Kureishi – My Beautiful Film Career"], British Library, 2014.</ref>

Major influences on Kureishi's writing include [[P.G. Wodehouse]] and [[Philip Roth]].<ref Name=McCrum /> Kureishi's uncle was the writer, columnist and Pakistani cricket commentator and team manager [[Omar Kureishi]].<ref>Andreas Athanasiades, [http://euroacademia.eu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Andreas_Athanasiades_Re-imagining_Identity-Revisiting_Hanif_Kureishis_My_Beautiful_Laundrette.pdf "Re-imagining Identity: Revisiting Hanif Kureishi’s ''My Beautiful Laundrette''"], University of Cyprus.</ref> The poet [[Maki Kureishi]] was his aunt.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=elm3N0mPP6AC&q=Maki%20Kureishi&pg=PA27| title=Hanif Kureishi| author=B.
