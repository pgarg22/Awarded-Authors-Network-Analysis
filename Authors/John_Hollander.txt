==Life==

Hollander resided in [[Woodbridge, Connecticut]], where he served as a judge for several high-school recitation contests, and said he enjoyed working with students on their poetry and teaching it.   With his ex-wife, [[Anne Hollander|Anne Loesser]] (daughter of pianist [[Arthur Loesser]];<ref>{{cite web|author=Benjamin Ivry |url=http://forward.com/articles/15078/praising-sacred-places-richard-howard-s-jewish-/ |title=Praising Sacred Places: Richard Howard's Jewish Roots - Culture – |website=Forward.com |date=February 3, 2009 |access-date=March 6, 2016}}</ref> married 1953–77), he was the father of writer [[Martha Hollander]] and uncle of the songwriter [[Sam Hollander]]. He married Natalie Charkow in 1981.

Hollander died at [[Branford, Connecticut]], on August 17, 2013, at the age of 83.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/19/books/john-hollander-poet-known-for-his-range-dies-at-83.html?pagewanted=all|title=John Hollander, Poet at Ease With Intellectualism and Wit, Dies at 83|first=William|last= Grimes|date=August 18, 2013|work=The New York Times}}</ref>

==Poetic career==
Hollander stressed the importance of hearing poems out loud: 'A good poem satisfies the ear. It creates a story or picture that grabs you, informs you and entertains you'.<ref name=cwbnyt210>Boynton, Cynthia Wolfe, "Venerable Poet's Words To a Pop Music Beat", ''The New York Times'', Connecticut and the Region section, February 10, 2008, p. 6.</ref> The poet needs to be aware of the "sound of sense; the music of speech".<ref>Essay: "The Poem in the Ear", ''Vision and Resonance: Two senses of Poetic Form'' (1975).</ref> To Hollander, verse was a kind of music in words, and he spoke eloquently about their connection with the human voice.<ref name="Yezzi, David 2013"/>

Also known for his translations from [[Yiddish]].
Hollander usually wrote his poems on a computer, but if inspiration struck him, he offered that, "I've been known to start poems on napkins and scraps of paper, too."<ref name=cwbnyt210/>

Hollander was also considered to have technical poetic powers without equal,<ref>Howard Richard, ''Alone in America: Essays on the art of poetry in U.S.since 1950'', 1969.</ref> as exampled by his "Powers of Thirteen" poem, an extended sequence of 169 (13x13) unrhymed 13-line [[stanza]]s with 13 syllables in each line.<ref>Breslin, Paul, Review of ''Powers of Thirteen'', ''Poetry'', vol. 145, no. 3, December 1984.</ref> These constraints liberated rather than inhibited Hollander's imagination, giving a fusion of [[metaphor]]s that enabled Hollander to conceive this work as "a perpetual calendar".<ref>Lehman, David - article in ''Newsweek'', January 23, 1984.</ref> Hollander also composed poems as "graphematic" [[emblem]]s (''Type of Shapes'', 1969) and epistolary poems (exampled in ''Reflections on Espionage'', 1976),<ref>Hollander, John - interview by email with Paul Devlin March/April 2003.</ref> and, as a critic (in ''Vision and Resonance: Two Senses of Poetic Form'', 1975), offered telling insights into the relationship between words and music and sound in poetry, and in metrical experimentation,<ref>Attridge, Dennis, Review of ''Vision and Resonance: Two senses of Poetic Form'', ''MLR'', vol. 72, no. 3, July 1973.</ref> and 'the lack of a theory of graphic [[Metre (poetry)|prosody]]'.<ref>Rothman, David, "Verse, Prose speech, Counting and the Problem of Graphic Order", ''Versification'', vol. 1, no. 1, March 21, 1997.</ref>

Hollander influenced poets Todd LaRoche and [[Karl Kirchwey]], who both studied under Hollander at [[Yale College|Yale]]. Hollander taught him that it was possible to build a life around the task of writing poetry.<ref name=twsOctBeqqq>{{cite news

}}</ref> Kirchwey recalled Hollander's passion:<ref name=twsOctBeqqq/>
'Since he is a poet himself ... he conveyed a passion for that knowledge as a source of current inspiration.'

Hollander also served in the following positions, among others: member of the board, [[Wesleyan University Press]] (1959–62); editorial assistant for poetry, ''[[Partisan Review]]'' (1959–65) and a contributing editor, of ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' (1969–71).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bookrags.com/tandf/hollander-john-tf/ |title=John Hollander|access-date=March 3, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629172527/http://www.bookrags.com/tandf/hollander-john-tf/ |archive-date=June 29, 2011 }}</ref> and also commenced his other role as a poetry critic.<ref>Hollander, John, Review "Stanley Cavell and the claim of Reason", ''Critical Inquiry'', vol. 6, no. 4, U of C P, Summer 1980.</ref>

Hollander's poetry has been set to music by [[Milton Babbitt]], [[Elliott Carter]], and others;<ref>''Readings in Contemporary Poetry'', December 1995</ref> in 2007 he collaborated with the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], allowing them use of his poem "An Old Fashioned Song" to create the song "[[Long Road out of Eden|No More Walks in the Wood]]".<ref>[[Sam Hollander]], "The Lives they Lived", ''New York Times Magazine'', December 21, 2013.</ref>
