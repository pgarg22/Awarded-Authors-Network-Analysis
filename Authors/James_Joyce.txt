'''James Augustine Aloysius Joyce''' (2 February 1882 – 13 January 1941) was an Irish novelist, short story writer, poet and literary critic. He contributed to the [[Modernism|modernist]] [[avant-garde]] movement and is regarded as one of the most influential and important writers of the 20th century. Joyce's novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1922) is a landmark in which the episodes of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' are paralleled in a variety of literary styles, most famously [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]]. Other well-known works are the short-story collection ''[[Dubliners]]'' (1914) and the novels ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'' (1916) and ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' (1939). His other writings include three books of poetry, a play, letters and occasional journalism. 

Joyce was born in [[Dublin]] into a middle-class family. A brilliant student, he attended the Jesuit [[Clongowes Wood College]] in County Kildare, then, briefly, the Christian Brothers-run [[O'Connell School]]. Despite the chaotic family life imposed by his father's unpredictable finances, he excelled at the Jesuit [[Belvedere College]] and graduated at [[University College Dublin|University College]] in Dublin in 1902. In 1904, he met his future wife [[Nora Barnacle]] and they moved to mainland Europe. He briefly worked in [[Pula|Pola]] and then moved to [[Trieste]] in [[Austria-Hungary]], working as an English instructor. Except for an eight-month stay in Rome working as a correspondence clerk and three visits to Dublin, Joyce resided there until 1915. In Trieste, he published his book of poems ''Chamber Music'' and his short story collection ''Dubliners'', and he began serially publishing ''The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man'' in the English magazine ''[[The Egoist]]''. During most of World War I, Joyce lived in [[Zürich]], Switzerland and worked on ''Ulysses''. After the war, he briefly returned to Trieste and then moved to Paris in 1920, which became his primary residence until 1940. 

''Ulysses'' was first published in Paris in 1922, but its publication in England and the United States was prohibited because of its perceived obscenity. Copies were smuggled into both countries and pirated versions were printed until the mid-1930s, when publication finally became legal. Joyce started his next major work, ''Finnegans Wake'', in 1923, publishing it sixteen years later in 1939. Between these years, Joyce travelled widely. He and Nora were married in a civil ceremony in London in 1930. He made a number of trips to Switzerland, frequently seeking treatment for his increasingly severe eye problems and psychological help for his daughter, [[Lucia Joyce|Lucia]]. When France was occupied by Germany during World War II, Joyce moved back to Zürich in 1940. He died there in 1941 after surgery for a perforated ulcer, less than one month before his 59th birthday.

''Ulysses'' ranks high in lists of great books of literature, and the academic literature analysing his work is extensive and ongoing. Many writers, film-makers and other artists have been influenced by his stylistic innovations, such as his meticulous attention to detail, use of [[interior monologue]], [[word play|wordplay]], and the radical transformation of traditional plot and character development. Though most of his adult life was spent abroad, his fictional universe centres on Dublin and is largely populated by characters who closely resemble family members, enemies and friends from his time there. ''Ulysses'' in particular is set in the streets and alleyways of the city. Joyce is quoted as saying, "For myself, I always write about Dublin, because if I can get to the heart of Dublin I can get to the heart of all the cities of the world. In the particular is contained the universal."{{sfn|Ellmann|1982|p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce0000ellm_n2o5/page/505 505]|ps=: Cited from {{cite book|title=From an Old Waterford House|last=Power|first=Arthur|date=n.d.|location=London|pages=63–64|ref=none}} }}

Joyce was born on 2 February 1882 at 41 Brighton Square, [[Rathgar]], [[Dublin]], Ireland,{{sfn|Bowker|2012|p= [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycenewbio0000bowk/page/19 19]}} to [[John Stanislaus Joyce]] and Mary Jane "May" ({{nee}} Murray). He was the eldest of ten surviving siblings.

Joyce's paternal grandfather, James Augustine, married Ellen O'Connell, daughter of John O'Connell, a Cork alderman who owned a drapery business and other properties in [[Cork City]]. Ellen's family claimed kinship with the political leader [[Daniel O'Connell]], who had helped secure the [[Catholic emancipation]] for the Irish in 1829.{{sfn|Jackson|Costello|1998|p=[https://archive.org/details/johnstanislausjo00jack/page/20 20]}} The Joyce family's purported ancestor, [[Seán Mór Seoighe]] was a stonemason from [[Connemara]].{{sfn|Jackson|Costello|1998|pp=[https://archive.org/details/johnstanislausjo00jack/page/6 6–7]}}

Joyce's father was appointed rate collector by [[Dublin Corporation]] in 1887. The family then moved to the fashionable small town of [[Bray, County Wicklow|Bray]],{{convert|12|mi|km}} from Dublin. Joyce was attacked by a dog around this time, leading to his lifelong [[cynophobia|fear of dogs]].{{sfnm|Beach|1959|1p=[https://archive.org/details/shakespearecompa00beac/page/37 37]|Joyce|1958|2p= [https://archive.org/details/mybrotherskeeper00joyc/page/4 4]}}{{efn|Joyce's fear of dogs may have been exaggerated.{{sfn|Spielberg|1964|pp=[https://www.jstor.org/stable/25486441?seq=1 42–44]}} }} He later developed a [[astraphobia|fear of thunderstorms]],{{sfnm|Beach|1959|1p= [https://archive.org/details/shakespearecompa00beac/page/43 43]|Gorman|1939|2p= [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce00gorm/page/328 328]|Joyce|1958|3p= [https://archive.org/details/mybrotherskeeper00joyc/page/18 18]}} which he acquired through a superstitious aunt who had described them as a sign of God's wrath.{{sfnm|Bowker|2012|1p= [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycenewbio0000bowk/page/25 25]|Costello|1992|2pp= [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyceyearso0000cost_l4b7/page/63 63–64]}}{{efn| According to Irish artist Arthur Power, Joyce, who sometimes took his children and Power on a ride, once ordered the driver to turn home when a storm broke out.

In 1891, nine-year-old Joyce wrote the poem "Et Tu, Healy" on the death of [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] that his father printed and distributed to friends.{{sfnm|Bowker|2012|1p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycenewbio0000bowk/page/38 38]|Ellmann|1982|2p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce0000ellm_n2o5/page/33 33]|Joyce|1958|3pp=[https://archive.org/details/mybrotherskeeper00joyc/page/44 44–45]}} The poem expressed the sentiments of the elder Joyce,{{sfnm|1a1=Ellmann|1y=1982|1p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce0000ellm_n2o5/page/33 33]|2a1=Jackson|2a2=Costello|2y=1998|2p=[https://archive.org/details/johnstanislausjo00jack/page/170 170]}} who was angry at Parnell's apparent betrayal by the [[Catholic Church in Ireland#Politics|Irish Catholic Church]], the [[Irish Parliamentary Party#Zenith eclipse|Irish Parliamentary Party]], and the [[Liberal Party (UK)#Ireland and Home Rule|British Liberal Party]] that resulted in a collaborative failure to secure [[Irish Home Rule movement|Irish Home Rule]] in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]].{{sfn|McCaffrey|2006|pp= [https://archive.org/details/insearchofirelan0000mcca/page/198 198–199]}} This sense of betrayal, particularly by the church, left a lasting impression that Joyce expressed in his life and art.{{sfn|McCaffrey|2006|p= [https://archive.org/details/insearchofirelan0000mcca/page/200 200]}} 

In the same year, Joyce's family began to slide into poverty, worsened by his father's drinking and financial mismanagement.{{sfnm|1a1=Ellmann|1y=1982|1p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce0000ellm_n2o5/page/34 34–35]|2a1=Jackson|2a2=Costello|2y=1998|2pp=[https://archive.org/details/johnstanislausjo00jack/page/172 172–173]}} John Joyce's name was published in ''[[Stubbs' Gazette]]'', a blacklist of debtors and bankrupts, in November 1891, and he was temporarily suspended from work.{{sfnm|1a1=Bowker|1y=2012|1p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycenewbio0000bowk/page/38 38]|2a1=Jackson|2a2=Costello|2y=1998|2p=[https://archive.org/details/johnstanislausjo00jack/page/173 173]}} In January 1893, he was dismissed with a reduced pension.{{sfnm|1a1=Ellmann|1y=1982|1p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce0000ellm_n2o5/page/34 34]|2a1=Jackson|2a2=Costello|2y=1998|2p=[https://archive.org/details/johnstanislausjo00jack/page/176 176]}} 

Joyce began his education in 1888 at [[Clongowes Wood College]], a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] boarding school near [[Clane]], County Kildare, but had to leave in 1892 when his father could no longer pay the fees. He studied at home and briefly attended the [[O'Connell School|Christian Brothers O'Connell School]] on North Richmond Street, Dublin. Joyce's father then had a chance meeting with the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest [[John Conmee]], who knew the family. Conmee arranged for Joyce and his brother [[Stanislaus Joyce|Stanislaus]] to attend the Jesuits' Dublin school, [[Belvedere College]], without fees starting in 1893.{{sfn|Ellmann|1982|p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce0000ellm_n2o5/page/35 35]}} In 1895, Joyce, now aged 13, was elected by his peers to join the [[Sodality of Our Lady]].{{sfnm|Costello|1992|1p= [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyceyearso0000cost_l4b7/page/132 132]|McCourt|1999a|2p= [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycepassio0000mcco/page/22 22]}} Joyce spent five years at Belvedere, his intellectual formation guided by the principles of Jesuit education laid down in the ''[[Ratio Studiorum]]'' (''Plan of Studies'').{{sfn|Sullivan|1958|pp= [https://archive.org/details/joyceamongjesuit00sull/page/9 9–10]}} He displayed his writing talent by winning first place for English composition in his final two years{{sfn|Sullivan|1958|p= [https://archive.org/details/joyceamongjesuit00sull/page/105 105]}} before graduating in 1898.{{sfn|Manglaviti|2000|p= [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25474127?seq=2 215]}}

Joyce kept writing despite all these changes. He completed 24 chapters of ''Stephen Hero''{{sfn|Ellmann1982|p= [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce0000ellm_n2o5/page/207 207]}} and all but the final story of ''Dubliners''.{{sfn|Groden|1984|pp= [https://archive.org/details/companiontojoyce00etat/page/80 80–81]}} But he was unable to get ''Dubliners'' in press. Though the London publisher [[Grant Richards (publisher)|Grant Richards]] had contracted with Joyce to publish it, the printers were unwilling to print passages they found controversial because English law could hold them liable if they were brought to court for indecent language.{{sfnm|Bowker|2012|p= [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycenewbio0000bowk/page/152 152]|Hutton|2003|2pp= [https://www.jstor.org/stable/24295682?seq=4 498–500]}} Richards and Joyce went back and forth trying to find a solution where the book could avoid legal liability while preserving Joyce's sense of artistic integrity. As they continued to negotiate, Richards began to scrutinise the stories more carefully. He became concerned that the book might damage his publishing house's reputation and eventually backed down from his agreement.{{sfn|Hutton|2003|p= [https://www.jstor.org/stable/24295682?seq=9 503]}}

Roberts had the printed sheets destroyed, though Joyce was able to obtain a copy of the proof sheets.{{efn|It was in the midst of these frustrations with Richards in 1911 that Joyce was alleged to have thrown the manuscript of the first three chapters of ''A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man'' into a stove fire, only to have it rescued by Eileen.{{sfn|Bowker|2012|p= [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycenewbio0000bowk/page/197 197]}} }} When Joyce returned to Trieste, he wrote an invective against Roberts, "Gas from a Burner".{{sfn|Joyce|1959|pp=[https://archive.org/details/criticalwritings00joyc/page/242 242–245]|ps=: "Gas from a Burner"}} He never went to Dublin again.{{sfn|Bowker|2012|pp= [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycenewbio0000bowk/page/204 204–205]}}

====Publication of ''Dubliners'' and ''A Portrait'' ====
Joyce's fortunes changed for the better 1913 when Richards agreed to publish ''Dubliners''. It was issued on 15 June 1914,{{sfn|Bowker|2012|p= [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycenewbio0000bowk/page/212 212]}} eight and a half years since Joyce had first submitted it to him.{{sfn|Hutton|2003|pp= [https://www.jstor.org/stable/24295682 495–496]}} Around the same time, he found an unexpected advocate in [[Ezra Pound]], who was living in London.{{efn|The literary critic [[Mary Colum]], who was personally well-acquainted with Joyce, reports him as saying: "Pound took me out of the gutter."{{sfn|Colum|1947|p= [https://archive.org/details/LifeAndTheDream/page/n395 383]}} }} On the advice of Yeats,{{sfn|Gibson|2006|p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce00gibs/page/93 93]}} Pound wrote to Joyce asking if he could include a poem from ''Chamber Music'', "I Hear an Army Charging upon the Land" in the journal ''[[Des Imagistes]]''. They struck up a correspondence that lasted until the late 1930s. Pound became Joyce's promoter, helping ensure that Joyce's works were both published and publicized.{{sfnm|Kelly|1993|1p= [https://www.jstor.org/stable/26635100 21]|Walkiewicz|1982|2p= [https://www.jstor.org/stable/24725366?seq=2 512]}}

After Pound persuaded [[Dora Marsden]] to [[Serial (literature)|serially]] publish ''A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man'' in the London literary magazine ''[[The Egoist]]'',{{sfn|Bowker|2012|p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycenewbio0000bowk/page/211]}} Joyce's pace of writing increased. He completed ''A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man'' by 1914;{{sfn|Gabler|1974|p =[https://www.jstor.org/stable/40371587 1]}} resumed ''Exiles'', completing it in 1915;{{sfn|Brivic|1968|p= [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25486737 29]}} started the novelette [[Giacomo Joyce]], which he eventually abandoned;{{sfnm|Bowker|2012|1p = [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycenewbio0000bowk/page/214 214]|McCourt|2000|2pp= [https://archive.org/details/yearsofbloomjame0000mcco/page/196 196–197]}} and began drafting ''Ulysses''.{{sfnm|Bowker|2012|1p= [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycenewbio0000bowk/page/217 217]|Ellmann|1982|2p= [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce0000ellm_n2o5/page/389 389]|McCourt|2000|3p=[https://archive.org/details/yearsofbloomjame0000mcco/page/246 246]}} 

In August 1914, World War I broke out. Although Joyce and Stanislaus were subjects of the United Kingdom, which was now at war with Austria-Hungary, they remained in Trieste. Even when Stanislaus, who had publicly expressed his sympathy for the Triestine irredentists, was interned at the beginning of January 1915, Joyce chose to stay. In May 1915, Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary,{{sfn|Spoo|1986|p= [https://www.jstor.org/stable/441379?&seq=2 137]}} and less than a month later Joyce took his family to Zürich in neutral Switzerland.{{sfnm|Beja|1992|1p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycelitera0000beja/page/71 71]|McCourt|2000|2pp= [https://archive.org/details/yearsofbloomjame0000mcco/page/245 245–247]}}

==1915–1920: Zürich and Trieste==
===Zürich===
[[File:Zurich, Switzerland (26459893447).jpg|thumb|Zürich, Switzerland where Joyce lived 1915–1919]]
Joyce arrived in Zürich as a double exile: he was an Irishman with a British passport and a Triestine on parole from Austria-Hungary.{{sfn|Stanzel|2001|pp= [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25477813?&seq=4 364–365]}} To get to Switzerland, he had to promise the Austro-Hungarian officials that he would not help the Allies during the war, and he and his family had to leave almost all of their possessions in Trieste.{{sfnm|Bowker|2012|1p= [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycenewbio0000bowk/page/217 217]|Ellmann|1982|2p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce0000ellm_n2o5/page/386 386]|Gibson|2006|3pp=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce00gibs/page/106 106], [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce00gibs/page/116 116] }} During the war, he was kept under surveillance by both the English and Austro-Hungarian secret service.{{sfn|Stanzel|2001|p= [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25477813?&seq=5 365]}}

Joyce's first concern was earning a living. One of Nora's relatives sent them a small sum to cover the first few months. Pound and Yeats worked with the British government to provide a stipend from the [[Royal Literary Fund]] in 1915 and a grant from the British [[Civil list#United Kingdom|civil list]] the following year.{{sfnm|Fischer|2021|1p=[{{Google Books|id=-IETEAAAQBAJ|pg=PA15|plainurl=yes}} 15]|McCourt|1999a|2p= [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycepassio0000mcco/page/76 76]}} Eventually, Joyce received large regular sums from the editor [[Harriet Shaw Weaver]], who operated ''The Egoist'', and the psychotherapist [[Edith Rockefeller McCormick]], who lived in Zürich studying under [[Carl Jung]].{{sfnm|Beja|1992|1pp=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycelitera0000beja/page/75 75–76]|McCourt|1999a|2p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycepassio0000mcco/page/82 82]}} Weaver financially supported Joyce throughout the entirety of his life and even paid for his funeral.{{sfn|Gibson|2006|p= [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce00gibs/page/132 132]}} Between 1917 and the beginning of 1919, Joyce was financially secure and lived quite well;{{sfn|McCourt|1999a|p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycepassio0000mcco/page/82 82]}} the family sometimes stayed in Locarno in the Italian-speaking region of Switzerland.{{sfn|Bowker|2012|pp= [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycenewbio0000bowk/page/234 234], [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycenewbio0000bowk/page/238 238]}} But health problems remained a constant issue. During their time in Zürich, both Joyce and Nora suffered illnesses that were diagnosed as "nervous breakdowns"{{sfnm|Bowker|2012|1p= [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycenewbio0000bowk/page/228 228]|Grandt|2003|2p=[https://www.jstor.org/stable/26285204 78]|Maddox|1989|3p=[https://archive.org/details/nora00bren/page/141 141]}} and he had to undergo many eye surgeries.{{sfnm|Beja|1992|1p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycelitera0000beja/page/78 78]|Gorman|1939|2p= [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce00gorm/page/232 232]}}

====''Ulysses''====
During the war, Zürich was the centre of a vibrant expatriate community. Joyce's regular evening hangout was the Cafe Pfauen,{{sfnm|Gorman|1939|1p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce00gorm/page/233 233]|Maddox|1989|2p= [https://archive.org/details/nora00bren/page/142 142]|Borach|1931|3p=[https://www.jstor.org/stable/371650?seq=1 325]}} where he got to know a number of the artists living in the city at the time, including the sculptor [[August Suter (sculptor)|August Suter]]{{sfn|Suter|1926|p=[https://archive.org/details/portraitsofartis0000unse_p0n8/page/61 61]}} and the painter [[Frank Budgen]].{{sfnm|Budgen|1934|1pp=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycemaking00budg/page/9 9–15]|Gorman|1939|2p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce00gorm/page/233 233]}} He often used the time spent with them as material for ''Ulysses''.{{sfn|Potts|1979|p= [https://archive.org/details/portraitsofartis0000unse_p0n8/page/59 59]}} He made the acquaintance of the writer [[Stefan Zweig]],{{sfnm|Ellmann|1982|1p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce0000ellm_n2o5/page/603 603]|Zweig|1941|2p= [https://archive.org/details/worldofyesterday00zwei/page/275 275]}} who organised the premiere of ''Exiles'' in Munich in August 1919.{{sfn|Nadel|1989|p=[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3831378?seq=11 151]}} He became aware of [[Dada]], which was coming into its own at the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich)|Cabaret Voltaire]].{{sfn|Nadel|2008|p= [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30244390?&seq=5 485]}}{{efn|In 1920, Joyce wrote that the Irish press reported him as the founder of Dada.{{sfn|Joyce|1966b|p= [https://archive.org/details/letterofjamesjoy03joyc/page/22 22]|ps=: Letter to Stanislaus Joyce, 14 September 1920}} }} He may have even met the [[Marxism|Marxist]] theoretician and revolutionary [[Vladimir Lenin]] at the Cafe Odeon,{{sfnm|Ellmann|1982|1p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce0000ellm_n2o5/page/409 409]|Gibson|2006|2p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce00gibs/page/116 116]}} a place they both frequented.{{sfn|McCourt|1999a|p= [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycepassio0000mcco/page/74 74]}}

Joyce kept up his interest in music. He met [[Ferruccio Busoni]],{{sfnm|1a1=Ellmann|1y=1982|1p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce0000ellm_n2o5/page/409 409]|2a1=Hodgart|2a2=Bauerle|2y=1997|2p= [https://archive.org/details/joycesgrandopero0006hodg/page/54 55]}} staged music with [[Otto Luening]], and learned music theory from [[Philipp Jarnach]].{{sfn|Grandt|2003|p= [https://www.jstor.org/stable/26285204?&seq=2 75]}} Much of what Joyce learned about musical notation and counterpoint found its way into ''Ulysses'', particularly the "Sirens" section.{{sfnm|Grandt|2003|1p= [https://www.jstor.org/stable/26285204?&seq=4 77]|Luening|1980|2p= [https://archive.org/details/odysseyofamerica0000luen/page/197 197]}} 

Joyce avoided public discussion of the war's politics and maintained a strict neutrality.{{sfnm|Gibson|2006|1pp =[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce00gibs/page/107 107–108]|Gorman|1939|2pp= [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce00gorm/page/233 233], [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce00gorm/page/240 240–241]|Manganiello|1980|3p= [https://archive.org/details/joycespolitics0000mang/page/162 162]}} He made few comments about the 1916 [[Easter Rising]] in Ireland; although he was sympathetic to the Irish independence movement,{{sfnm|Gorman|1939|p = [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce00gorm/page/234 234]}} he disagreed with its violence.{{sfnm|Beja|1992|1p= [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycelitera0000beja/page/71 71]|Manganiello|1980|2pp= [https://archive.org/details/joycespolitics0000mang/page/162 162–163]}}{{efn|Budgen wrote: "Joyce, if asked, what he did during the Great War, could reply: 'I wrote Ulysses.'"{{sfn|Budgen|1934|p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycemaking00budg/page/190 190]}} }} He stayed intently focused on ''Ulysses''{{sfn|McCourt|1999a|pp= [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycepassio0000mcco/page/73 73–74]}}
and the ongoing struggle to get his work published. Some of the serial instalments of "The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man" in ''The Egoist'' had been censored by the printers, but the entire novel was published by [[B. W. Huebsch]] in 1916.{{sfn|Beja|1992|p= [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycelitera0000beja/page/60 60]}} In 1918, Pound got a commitment from [[Margaret Caroline Anderson]], the owner and editor of the New York-based literary magazine ''[[The Little Review]]'', to publish ''Ulysses'' serially.{{sfnm|Bowker|2012|1p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycenewbio0000bowk/page/241 241]|Gibson|2006|2p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce00gibs/page/132 132]}}

====The English Players====

[[File:Pfauen.jpg|thumb|The Pfauen in Zürich. Joyce's preferred hangout was the cafe, which used to be on the right corner.

Cafe used to be right of theatre]]

Joyce co-founded an acting company, the English Players, and became its business manager. The company was pitched to the British government as a contribution to the war effort,{{sfn|Gibson|2006|p= [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce00gibs/page/110 111]}} and mainly staged works by Irish playwrights, such as [[Oscar Wilde]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], and John Millington Synge.{{sfn|McCourt|1999a|p= [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycepassio0000mcco/page/78 78]}} For Synge's ''Riders to the Sea'', Nora played a principle role and Joyce sang offstage,{{sfn|Beja|1992|p =[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycelitera0000beja/page/72 73]}} which he did again when [[Robert Browning]]'s ''[[In a Balcony]]'' was staged. He hoped the company would eventually stage his play, ''Exiles'',{{sfnm|Maddox|1989|1p= [https://archive.org/details/nora00bren/page/154 154]|McCourt|1999a|2p= [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycepassio0000mcco/page/78 78]}} but his participation in the English Players declined in the wake of the [[Spanish flu|Great Influenza epidemic]] of 1918, though the company continued until 1920.{{sfn|Gorman|1939|p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce00gorm/page/260 261]}}

Joyce's work with the English Players involved him in a lawsuit. [[Henry Wilfred Carr]], a wounded war veteran and British consul, accused Joyce of underpaying him for his role in ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]''. Carr sued for compensation; Joyce countersued for libel. When the cases were settled in 1919, Joyce won the compensation case but lost the one for libel.{{sfnm|Beja|1992|1pp=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycelitera0000beja/page/72 72–73]|Gibson|2006|2pp=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce00gibs/page/112 112–113]|Rushing|2000|3pp =[https://www.jstor.org/stable/25477748 371–372]}} The incident ended up creating acrimony between the British consulate and Joyce for the rest of his time in Zürich.{{sfnm|Bowker|2012|1p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycenewbio0000bowk/page/254 254]|Gibson|2006|2pp=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce00gibs/page/113 113–114]}}

===Third stay in Trieste===
By 1919, Joyce was in financial straits again. McCormick stopped paying her stipend, partly because he refused to submit to psychoanalysis from Jung,{{sfnm|Beja|1992|1p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycelitera0000beja/page/75 75]|Bowker|2012|2p= [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycenewbio0000bowk/page/267 257]|Gorman|1939|3p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce00gorm/page/264 264]}} and Zürich had become expensive to live in after the war. Furthermore, he was becoming isolated as the city's emigres returned home. In October 1919, Joyce's family moved back to Trieste, but it had changed. The Austro-Hungarian empire had ceased to exist, and Trieste was now an Italian city in post-war recovery.{{sfn|McCourt|1999a|p= [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycepassio0000mcco/page/85 85]}} Eight months after his return, Joyce went to [[Sirmione]], Italy, to meet Pound, who made arrangements for him to move to Paris.{{sfnm|Bowker|2012|p= [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycenewbio0000bowk/page/273 273], [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycenewbio0000bowk/page/275]|Gibson|2006|2p =[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce00gibs/page/132 132]}} Joyce and his family packed their belongings and headed for Paris in June 1920.{{sfn|Gorman|1939|p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce00gorm/page/270 270]}}

==1920–1941: Paris and Zürich==

====Publication of ''Ulysses''====
Joyce finished writing ''Ulysses'' near the end of 1921, but had difficulties getting it published. With financial backing from the lawyer [[John Quinn (collector)|John Quinn]],{{sfn|Rainey|1996|p=[https://www.jstor.org/stable/25473767?seq=5 535]}}{{efn|Quinn was an early supporter of Joyce's work in the United States.

====''Finnegans Wake''====

In 1926, [[Eugene Jolas|Eugene]] and [[Maria Jolas|Maria]] Jolas serialised the novel in their magazine, ''[[transition (literary journal)|transition]]''.

Joyce's health problems afflicted him throughout his Paris years. He had over a dozen eye operations,{{sfnm|Beja|1992|1p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycelitera0000beja/page/78 78]|Bowker|2012|2p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycenewbio0000bowk/page/400 400]|Davies|1982|3p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyceportra1982davi/page/334 334]|Ellmann|1982|4p= [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce0000ellm_n2o5/page/622 622]}} but his vision severely declined.{{sfn|Gibson|2006|pp= [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce00gibs/page/151 151–152]}} By 1930, he was practically blind in the left eye and his right eye functioned poorly.{{sfn|Birmingham|2014|p= [https://archive.org/details/mostdangerousboo0000birm_n8r5/page/256 256]}} He even had all of his teeth removed because of problems related to his eyes.{{sfnm|Beja|1992|1p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycelitera0000beja/page/78 78]|Bowker|2012|2p= [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycenewbio0000bowk/page/320 320]}} 

At one point, Joyce became worried that he could not finish ''Finnegans Wake'', asking the Irish author [[James Stephens (author)|James Stephens]] to complete it if something should happen.{{sfnm|Beja|1992|1p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycelitera0000beja/page/9 93]|Bowker|2012|2p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycenewbio0000bowk/page/364 364]|Gibson|2006|3p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce00gibs/page/149 149]}} His financial problems were ongoing.

====Marriage in London====
[[File:43. Adolf Hoffmeister, James Joyce, 1966.jpg|Drawing of Joyce by [[Adolf Hoffmeister]]|thumb|left|upright=.75]]
In 1930, Joyce began thinking of establishing a residence in London once more,{{sfnm|Ellmann|1982|1p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce0000ellm_n2o5/page/622 622]|Maddox|1989|2p=[https://archive.org/details/nora00bren/page/255 255]}} primarily to assure that Giorgio, who had just married Helen Fleischmann, would have his inheritance secured under British Law.{{sfnm|Bowker|2011|1p=[https://www.jstor.org/stable/24598884?&seq7 673]|Ellmann|1982|2p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce0000ellm_n2o5/page/622 622]}} Joyce moved to London, obtained a long-term lease on a flat, registered on the electoral role, and became liable for jury service. After living together for twenty-seven years, Joyce and Nora got married at the Registry Office in Kensington on 4 July 1931.{{sfnm|Bowker|2012|1p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycenewbio0000bowk/page/419 419]|Loukopoulou|2011|2p=[https://www.jstor.org/stable/24598885?&seq=5 687]}} Joyce stayed in London for at least six months to establish his residency, but abandoned his flat and returned to Paris later in the year when Lucia showed signs of mental illness. He planned to return, but never did and later became disaffected with England.{{sfnm|Bowker|2011|1pp=[https://www.jstor.org/stable/24598884?seq=9 675-675]}} 

In later years, Joyce lived in Paris but frequently travelled to Switzerland for eye surgery{{efn|He still retained his sense of humor and appreciation of music during these difficult times. For example, Joyce heard the composer [[Othmar Schoeck]]'s Song Cycle based on the poems of [[Gottfried Keller]], {{lang|de|Lebendig begraben}} [''Buried Alive''] while visiting Zürich in 1935. Afterwards, he went to Schoeck's house unannounced and dressed as a tramp to introduce himself to him. Afterwards he obtained [[Gottfried Keller]]'s poems and began to translate them.{{sfnm|Ellmann|1982|1p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce0000ellm_n2o5/page/669 669]|Gerber|2010|2p=[https://www.jstor.org/stable/23048756?&seq=2 479]}} }} or for treatment for Lucia,{{sfn|Fischer|2021|pp=[{{Google books|id=-IETEAAAQBAJ|2021|pg=PA22|plainurl=yes}} 22]–[{{Google books|id=-IETEAAAQBAJ|2021|pg=PA23|plainurl=yes}} 23]}} who was diagnosed with schizophrenia.{{sfn|Beja|1992|p= [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycelitera0000beja/page/115 115]}} Lucia was analysed by Carl Jung, who had previously written that ''Ulysess'' was similar to schizophrenic writing.{{sfnm|Jung|1952|1pp= [https://archive.org/details/spiritinmanartli0015jung/page/116 116–117]| Shloss|2005|2p=[https://archive.org/details/luciajoycetodanc0000shlo_d2b8/page/278 278]}}{{efn|Jung also states: "It would never occur to me to class ''Ulysses'' as a product of schizophrenia{{nbsp}}...

===Final return to Zürich===
In the late 1930s, Joyce became increasingly concerned about the rise of fascism and antisemitism.{{sfn|Beja|1992|p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycelitera0000beja/page/122 122]}} As early as 1938, Joyce was involved in helping a number Jews escape Nazi persecution.{{sfnm|Bowker|2012|1p= [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycenewbio0000bowk/page/500 500]|Nadel|1986|2pp=[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1396219?seq=8 306–308]}} After the [[Armistice with France (Second Compiègne)| defeat of France]] in World War II, Joyce and his family fled from [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|Nazi occupation]], returning to Zürich a final time.{{sfn|Gibson|2006|pp=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce00gibs/page/155 155–156]}}

==Death==

]]
On 11 January 1941, Joyce underwent surgery in Zürich for a [[perforated ulcer|perforated duodenal ulcer]]. He fell into a coma the following day. He awoke at 2&nbsp;am on 13 January 1941, and asked a nurse to call his wife and son. They were en route when he died 15&nbsp;minutes later, less than a month before his 59th birthday.{{sfn|Ellmann|1982|pp=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce0000ellm_n2o5/page/740 740–741]}}

His body was buried in the [[Fluntern Cemetery]] in Zürich. Swiss tenor [[Max Meili]] sang "Addio terra, addio cielo" from [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]]'s ''[[L'Orfeo]]'' at the burial service.{{sfn|Ellmann|1982|p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce0000ellm_n2o5/page/743 743]}} Although two senior Irish diplomats were in Switzerland at the time, neither attended Joyce's funeral, and the Irish government later declined Nora's offer to permit the repatriation of Joyce's remains. He had been a subject of the United Kingdom all his life and only the British consul attended the funeral. When [[Joseph Walshe]], secretary at the Department of External Affairs in Dublin, was informed of Joyce's death by Frank Cremins, ''[[chargé d'affaires]]'' at [[Bern]], Walshe responded, "Please wire details of Joyce's death. If possible find out did he die a Catholic? Express sympathy with Mrs Joyce and explain inability to attend funeral."{{sfn|Jordan|2018}} Buried originally in an ordinary grave, Joyce was moved in 1966 to a more prominent "honour grave", with a seated portrait statue by American artist [[Milton Hebald]] nearby. Nora, whom he had married in 1931, survived him by 10 years. She is buried by his side, as is their son Giorgio, who died in 1976.{{sfn|Jordan|2018}}

In October 2019, a motion was put to [[Dublin City Council]] to plan and budget for the costs of the exhumations and reburials of Joyce and his family somewhere in Dublin, subject to his family's wishes.{{sfn|Horgan-Jones|2019}} The proposal immediately became controversial, with the ''[[Irish Times]]'' commenting: "{{nbsp}}... it is hard not to suspect that there is a calculating, even mercantile, aspect to contemporary Ireland's relationship to its great writers, whom we are often more keen to 'celebrate', and if possible monetise, than read".{{sfn|The Irish Times|2019}}

A number of Catholic critics suggest that Joyce never fully abandoned his faith,{{sfnm|Noon|1957|1pp= [https://archive.org/details/joyceaquinas0000noon/page/14 14–15]|Strong|1949|2pp= [https://archive.org/details/sacredriverappro0000stro/page/11 11–12]}} wrestling with it in his writings and becoming increasingly reconciled with it.{{sfnm|Boyle|1978|1pp= [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycespauli0000boyl/page/n13 x–xi]| Strong|1949|2pp =[https://archive.org/details/sacredriverappro0000stro/page/158 158–161]}} They argue that ''Ulysses'' and ''Finnegans Wake'' are expressions of a Catholic sensibility,{{sfn|Segall|1993|p=[https://archive.org/details/joyceinamericacu00sega/page/140 140]}} insisting that the critical views of religion expressed by Stephen, the protagonist of ''A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man'' and ''Ulysses'', does not represent the views of Joyce the author.{{sfn|Segall|1993|p=[https://archive.org/details/joyceinamericacu00sega/page/160 160]}} 

Joyce's attitude toward Catholicism has been described as an enigma in which there are two Joyces: a modern one who resisted Catholic tradition and another who maintained his allegiance to it.{{sfn|Gibson|2006|p= [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce00gibs/page/41 41]}} It has alternatively been described as a [[dialectic]] that is both affirming and denying. For example, Stephen Dedalus's statement in ''A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man'' "{{lang|lt|[[non-serviam]]}} (I will not serve)"{{sfn|Joyce|1916b|p= [https://archive.org/details/portraitofartist00joycrich/page/134 134]}} is qualified — "I will not serve ''that which I no longer believe''",{{sfn|Joyce|1916b|p= [https://archive.org/details/portraitofartist00joycrich/page/291 291]}} and that the ''non-serviam'' will always be balanced by Stephen's "I am{{nbsp}}... [a] servant too"{{sfn|Joyce|1922|p=[https://archive.org/details/ulysses00joyc_1/page/11 11]}} and the "yes" of [[Molly Bloom#Soliloquy|Molly Bloom's final soliloquy]]{{sfn|Joyce|1922|p=[https://archive.org/details/ulysses00joyc_1/page/732 732]}} in ''Ulysses''.{{sfn|Hughs|1992|p= [{{Google books|id=t8tKQcfn_QEC|pg=PA122|plainurl=yes}} 122]}} 
Some critics have suggested that Joyce's apparent apostasy was less a denial of faith than a transmutation,{{sfnm|Ellmann|1982|1pp=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce0000ellm_n2o5/page/65 65–66]|Jung|1952|2p= [https://archive.org/details/spiritinmanartli0015jung/page/120 120]|ps=:cf., an earlier translation of Jung's statement ({{harvnb|Jung|1949|p= [https://www.google.com/books/edition/Ulysses/iCl1yAEACAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=pious%20Catholic 10]}}, also quoted in {{harvnb|Noon|1957|p= [https://archive.org/details/joyceaquinas0000noon/page/14 15]}}) }} a criticism of the Church's adverse impact on spiritual life and personal development.{{sfn|Morse|1959|pp= [https://archive.org/details/sympatheticalien0000mors/page/3 3], [https://archive.org/details/sympatheticalien0000mors/page/16 16]}} He has been compared to the medieval {{lang|la|[[episcopi vagantes]]}} [wandering bishops], who left their discipline but not their cultural heritage of thought.{{sfn|Eco|1982|p=[https://archive.org/details/aestheticsofchao0000ecou/page/4 4]}}

Joyce's own responses to questions about his faith were often ambiguous. For example, during an interview after the completion of ''Ulysses'', Joyce was asked "When did you leave the Catholic Church". He answered, "That's for the Church to say."{{sfn|Davison|1998|p= [{{Google books|id=s_eXYzdEmxcC|pg=PA78|plainurl=yes}} 78]}}

''Dubliners'' is a collection of 15 short stories first published in 1914,{{sfn|Osteen|1995b|pp=[https://web.archive.org/web/20210922214926/https://markosteen.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/Osteen-Shoppers-Guide-to-Dubliners.pdf 483–484]}} that form a naturalistic depiction of Irish middle-class life in and around the city in the early 20th century. The tales were written when Irish nationalism and the search for national identity was at its peak. Joyce holds up a mirror to that identity as a first step in the spiritual liberation of Ireland.{{sfnm|Gibson|2006|1p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce00gibs/page/73 73]|1ps=|Joyce|1957|2p=[https://archive.org/details/letters00joyc/page/62 62–63]|2ps=: Letter to Grant Richards, 23 June 1906}}{{efn|Svevo writes: "What is fundamental in Joyce can be found entire in them [''Dubliners''].{{sfn|Svevo|1927|p= [https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce0000svev/page/n27 20]}} }} The stories centre on Joyce's idea of an epiphany: a moment when a character experiences a life-changing self-understanding or illumination. Many of the characters in ''Dubliners'' later appear in minor roles in Joyce's novel ''Ulysses''.{{sfn|Groden|n.d.}} The initial stories are narrated by child protagonists. Later stories deal with the lives and concerns of progressively older people. This aligns with Joyce's tripartite division of the collection into childhood, adolescence, and maturity.{{sfnm|Walzl|1977|p=[https://www.jstor.org/stable/25476081 408]|ps=:cf., {{harvnb|Halper|1979|pp=[https://www.jstor.org/stable/25476225?&seq=4 476–477]}}}}

===''A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man''===
{{Main|A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man}}
''A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man'', published in 1916, is a shortened rewrite of the abandoned novel ''Stephen Hero''. It is a ''[[Künstlerroman]]'', a kind of [[Bildungsroman|coming-of-age novel]] depicting the childhood and adolescence of the protagonist [[Stephen Dedalus]] and his gradual growth into artistic self-consciousness.{{sfn|Rando|2016|p= [https://digitalcommons.trinity.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1074&context=eng_faculty 47]}} It functions both as an autobiographical fiction of the author and a biography of the fictional protagonist.{{sfn|Riquelme|1983|p= [https://www.google.com/books/edition/Teller_and_Tale_in_Joyce_s_Fiction/ckO8AAAAIAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=autobiography 51]}} Some hints of the techniques Joyce frequently employed in later works, such as [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]], [[interior monologue]], and references to a character's psychic reality rather than to his external surroundings are evident throughout this novel.{{sfn|Spender|1970|p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycecritic0000demi/page/749 749]}}

===''Exiles'' and poetry===
{{Main|Chamber Music (poetry collection)|Pomes Penyeach}}

Despite early interest in the theatre, Joyce published only one play, ''[[Exiles (play)|Exiles]]'', begun shortly after the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 and published in 1918. A study of a husband-and-wife relationship, the play looks back to ''The Dead'' (the final story in ''Dubliners'') and forward to ''Ulysses'', which Joyce began around the time of the play's composition.{{sfn|Clark|1968|p= [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25486739 69]}}

He published three books of poetry.{{sfn|CI|n.d.}} The first full-length collection was ''[[Chamber Music (poetry collection)|Chamber Music]]'' (1907), which consisted of 36 short lyrics. It led to his inclusion in the ''[[Imagism|Imagist Anthology]]'', edited by Ezra Pound, a champion of Joyce's work. Other poetry Joyce published in his lifetime includes "Gas from a Burner" (1912), ''[[Pomes Penyeach]]'' (1927), and "Ecce Puer" (written in 1932 to mark the birth of his grandson and the recent death of his father). These were published by the [[Black Sun Press]] in ''Collected Poems'' (1936).{{sfn|Doyle|1965|p= [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25486486 90]}}

===''Ulysses''===

[[File:Ulysses22.jpg|thumb|First edition of ''Ulysses'' published by Shakespeare & Company, 1922|alt=alt=Worn out blue book cover saying 'Ulysses', at top and 'by James Joyce' at the bottom]]
The action of the ''Ulysses'' starts on 16 June 1904 at 8{{nbsp}}am and ends sometime after 2{{nbsp}}am the following morning. Much of it occurs inside the minds of the characters, who are portrayed through techniques such as interior monologue, dialogue, and soliloquy. The novel consists of 18 episodes, each covering roughly one hour of the day using a unique literary style.{{sfn|Kimpel|1975|pp=[https://www.jstor.org/stable/45108722 283–285]}} Joyce structured each chapter to refer to a individual episode in Homer's Odyssey, as well as a specific colour, a particular art or science, and a bodily organ.{{efn| This structure was not part of the original conception of ''Ulysses'',{{sfnm|Fludernik|1986|1p= [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25476719?seq=12 184]|Groden|2007|2p = [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25571018?seq=7 223]|Litz|1964|3p= [https://archive.org/details/artofjamesjoycem0000litz/page/34 34]}} but by 1921, Joyce was circulating two versions of this structure, known as the [[Linati schema for Ulysses|Linati schema]] and [[Gilbert schema for Ulysses|Gilbert schema]].{{sfn|Emerson|2017|p= [https://www.jstor.org/stable/26798610?seq=16 55]}} }} ''Ulysses'' sets the characters and incidents of [[Homer]]'s [[Odyssey]] in 1904 Dublin, representing [[Odysseus]] (Ulysses), [[Penelope]], and [[Telemachus]] in the characters of Leopold Bloom, his wife [[Molly Bloom]], and Stephen Dedalus. It uses humor,{{sfn|Kimpel|1975|pp=[https://www.jstor.org/stable/45108722?&seq=29 311–313]}} including parody, satire and comedy, to contrast the novel's characters with their Homeric models. Joyce played down the mythic correspondences by eliminating the chapter titles{{sfnm|Attridge|1997|1p=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgecompani0000unse_s3a6/page/27 27]|Dettmar|1992|2p=[https://archive.org/details/rereadingnewbac00dett/page/284 285]}} so the work could be read independently of its Homeric structure.{{sfnm|Attridge|1997|1p=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgecompani0000unse_s3a6/page/27 27]|Dettmar|1992|2p=[https://archive.org/details/rereadingnewbac00dett/page/284 285]|Wykes|1968|3p=[https://www.jstor.org/stable/40753991?seq=5 305]}} 

''Ulysses'' can be read as a study of Dublin in 1904, exploring various aspects of the city's life, dwelling on its squalor and monotony. Joyce claimed that if Dublin were to be destroyed in some catastrophe, it could be rebuilt using his work as a model.{{sfn|Budgen|1934|pp=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoycemaking00budg/page/67 67–68]}} To achieve this sense of detail, he relied on his memory, what he heard other people remember, and his readings to create a sense of fastidious detail.{{sfn|Ellmann|1982|pp=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyce0000ellm_n2o5/page/363 363–366]}} Joyce regularly used the 1904 edition of ''[[Thom's Directory]]''—a work that listed the owners and tenants of every residential and commercial property in the city—to ensure his descriptions were accurate.{{sfn|Hegglund|2003|pp=[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3176000?seq=3 168–167]}} This combination of kaleidoscopic writing, reliance on a formal schema to structure the narrative, and an exquisite attention to detail represents one of the book's major contributions to the development of 20th-century modernist literature.{{sfn|Sherry|2004|p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyceulysse0000sher/page/102 102]}}

===''Finnegans Wake''===
{{Main|Finnegans Wake}}

''Finnegans Wake'' is an experimental novel that pushes stream of consciousness{{sfnm|Kumar|1957|1p=[https://www.jstor.org/stable/434978 30]|Thompson|1964|2p=[https://www.jstor.org/stable/27540957?seq=3 80]}} and literary allusions{{sfn|Atherton|1960|p=[https://archive.org/details/booksatwake0000unse/page/22 22–23]}} to their extremes. Although the work can be read from beginning to end, Joyce's writing transforms traditional ideas of plot and character development through his wordplay, allowing the book to be read nonlinearly. Much of the word play stems from the work being written in a peculiar and obscure English, based mainly on [[portmanteau| complex multilevel puns]]. This approach is similar to, but far more extensive than, that used by [[Lewis Carroll]] in ''[[Jabberwocky]]''{{sfn|Attridge|2007|pp=[https://archive.org/details/howtoreadjoyce0000attr/page/85 85–86]}} and draws on a wide range of languages.{{sfn|Schotter|2010|p=[https://www.jstor.org/stable/41429838?seq=1 89]}} The associative nature of its language has led to it being interpreted as the story of a dream.{{sfn|Attridge|2013|p=[https://www.jstor.org/stable/24598778 195-197]}}{{efn|{{harvnb|Attridge|2013}} also critiques interpreting ''Finnegans Wake'' as a dream narrative.}}

Joyce's work still has a profound influence on contemporary culture.{{sfn|Attridge|1997|p=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgecompani0000unse_s3a6/page/n19 1]}}{{efn| See {{harvnb|TMO|n.d.}} and {{harvnb|Nastasi|2014}} for examples of various authors' responses to Joyce.}} ''Ulysses'' is a model for fiction writers, particularly its explorations in the power of language.{{sfn|Sherry|2004|p=[https://archive.org/details/jamesjoyceulysse0000sher/page/102 102]}} Its emphasis on the details of everyday life have opened up new possibilities of expression for authors, painters and film-makers.{{sfn|Attridge|1997|p=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgecompani0000unse_s3a6/page/1 1]}} It retains its prestige among readers, often ranking high on 'Great Book' lists.{{sfn|Mullin|2014}} Joyce's innovations extend beyond English literature: his writing has been an inspiration for Latin American writers,{{sfn|Levitt|2006|pp=[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3831743?seq=6 390–391]}} and ''Finnegans Wake'' has become one of the key texts for French [[post-structuralism]].{{sfnm|Attridge|2007|1p=[https://archive.org/details/howtoreadjoyce0000attr/page/4 4]|Chun|2015|2p=[https://www.jstor.org/stable/43737511?seq=5 75]|Lernout|1992|3p=[https://archive.org/details/frenchjoyce0000lern_s2e6/page/19 19]}} It also provided the name for the ''[[quark]]'', one of the [[elementary particle]]s proposed by physicist [[Murray Gell-Mann]].{{sfn|Gell-Mann|1994|p=[https://archive.org/details/quarkjaguar00gell/page/180 180]}}{{efn|''Quark'' comes from the phrase in ''Finnegans Wake'', "Three Quarks for Muster Mark".{{sfn|Joyce|1939|p =[https://web.archive.org/web/20110608025211/http://www.trentu.ca/faculty/jjoyce/fw-383.htm 383]}} Gell-Mann states that "the number three fitted perfectly with the way quarks occur in nature".{{sfn|Gell-Mann|1994|p=[https://archive.org/details/quarkjaguar00gell/page/180 180]}} }} 

The open-ended form of Joyce's novels keep them open to constant reinterpretation.{{sfn|Attridge|1997|p=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgecompani0000unse_s3a6/page/3 3]}} They inspire an increasingly global community of literary critics. Joyce studies—based on a relatively small canon of three novels, a small short story collection, one play, and two small books of poems—have generated over 15,000 articles, monographs, theses, translations and editions.{{sfn|Latham|2009|p=[{{Google books|id=0ddvLGKDz4QC|pg=PA148|plainurl=yes}} 148]}} 

In popular culture, the work and life of Joyce is celebrated annually on 16 June, known as Bloomsday, in Dublin and in an increasing number of cities worldwide.{{sfn|Murphy|2014}}

===Museums and study centres===
The [[National Library of Ireland]] holds a large collection of Joycean material including manuscripts and notebooks, much of it available online.{{sfn|Killeen|2012}} A joint venture between the library and University College Dublin, the [[Museum of Literature Ireland]] (branded MoLI in homage to Molly Bloom),{{sfn|Harnett|2019}} the majority of whose exhibits are about Joyce and his work, has both a small permanent Joyce-related collection, and borrows from its parent institutions; its displays include "Copy No. 1" of Ulysses.{{sfn|MoLI|n.d.}} Dedicated centres in Dublin include the [[James Joyce Centre]] in [[North Great George's Street]], the [[James Joyce Tower and Museum]] in [[Sandycove]] (the Martello tower where Joyce once lived, and the setting for the opening scene in Ulysses), and the [[Dublin Writers Museum]].{{sfn|Biggers|2015 |pp=[https://www.google.com/books/edition/British_Author_House_Museums_and_Other_M/rjCSCgAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=displays+trinity+college+dublin+writers+museum+university+college+library&pg=PA220&printsec=frontcover 215–221]}}
