== Critical Reception ==
Reviews of Messenger's works have been mixed. [[Kirkus Reviews|Kirkus]] found ''[[Keeper of the Lost Cities]]'' to be “wholesome shading to bland,” but with “exotic creatures and locales, plus an agreeable cast” and described ''Exile'' as a "cumbersome coming of age tale".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/shannon-messenger/keeper-lost-cities/|title=KEEPER OF THE LOST CITIES by Shannon Messenger|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/shannon-messenger/exile-messenger/|title=EXILE by Shannon Messenger|language=en}}</ref>

The [[Publishers Weekly]] review of ''Let the Sky Fall'' did not like the story's pacing and said that the “novel works best when Messenger’s characters are left to explore her vividly imagined world of wind, rather than just talk about it.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/9781442450417|title=Children's Book Review: Let the Sky Fall by Shannon Messenger|website=www.publishersweekly.com|access-date=2019-01-01}}</ref> Kirkus was more positive, stating that "Characterization elevates this romance over similar offerings in a crowded genre".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/shannon-messenger/let-sky-fall/|title=LET THE SKY FALL by Shannon Messenger|language=en}}</ref> Kirkus remained positive about ''Let the Storm Break''',''''' writing, “Witty, romantic and filled with personality — after the slow start.”<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/shannon-messenger/let-storm-break/|title=LET THE STORM BREAK by Shannon Messenger|language=en}}</ref>
