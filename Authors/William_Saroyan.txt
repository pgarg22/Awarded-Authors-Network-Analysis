'''William Saroyan'''<ref>{{lang-hy|Վիլեամ Սարոյեան in [[classical Armenian orthography|classical orthography]] and Վիլյամ Սարոյան in [[reformed Armenian orthography|reformed orthography]]}}</ref> ({{IPAc-en|s|ə|ˈ|r|ɔɪ|ə|n}}; August 31, 1908 – May 18, 1981) was an Armenian-American novelist, playwright, and short story writer. He was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] in 1940, and in 1943 won the [[Academy Award for Best Story]] for the film [[The Human Comedy (film)|''The Human Comedy'']]. When the studio rejected his original 240-page treatment, he turned it into a novel, ''[[The Human Comedy (novel)|The Human Comedy]].'' Saroyan is regarded as one of the greatest writers of the 20th century. 

Saroyan wrote extensively about the [[Armenian Americans|Armenian]] immigrant life in California. Many of his stories and plays are set in his native [[Fresno, California|Fresno]].<ref>{{cite news|title=William Saroyan Is Dead At 72; Wrote 'The Time of Your Life'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/19/obituaries/william-saroyan-is-dead-at-72-wrote-the-time-of-your-life.html|access-date=February 1, 2014|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 19, 1981}}</ref> Some of his best-known works are ''[[The Time of Your Life]]'', ''[[My Name Is Aram]]'' and '' [[My Heart's in the Highlands (play)|My Heart's in the Highlands]]''.

He has been described in a [[Dickinson College]] news release as "one of the most prominent literary figures of the mid-20th century"<ref>{{cite web|title=One-Man Show Tells Pulitzer-Prize Winning Author's Story|url=http://www2.dickinson.edu/news/arshow.cfm?226|publisher=[[Dickinson College]]|access-date=December 26, 2013|date=September 2, 2001}}</ref> and by [[Stephen Fry]] as "one of the most underrated writers of the [20th] century." Fry suggests that "he takes his place naturally alongside [[Hemingway]], [[Steinbeck]] and [[William Faulkner|Faulkner]]".<ref>[https://www.parajanov.com/saroyan 2013 Parajanov-Vartanov Institute Awards]</ref> Kurt Vonnegut has said that Saroyan was "the first and still the greatest of all the American minimalists.”<ref>[https://www.parajanov.com/saroyan Quotes by Stephen Fry, Kurt Vonnegut, Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams]</ref>

==Biography==
[[File:Saroyan.jpg|thumb|Saroyan as a youth]]

===Early years===
William Saroyan was born on August 31, 1908, in [[Fresno, California]], to Armenak and Takuhi Saroyan, [[Armenians|Armenian]] immigrants from [[Bitlis]], [[Ottoman Empire]]. His father came to New York in 1905 and started preaching in [[Armenian Apostolic church]]es.{{sfn|Hamalian|1987|p=23}}

At the age of three, after his father's death, Saroyan, along with his brother and sister, was placed in an orphanage in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], California. He later went on to describe his experience in the orphanage in his writings. Five years later, the family reunited in Fresno, where his mother, Takuhi, had already secured work at a cannery. He continued his education on his own, supporting himself with jobs, such as working as an office manager for the San Francisco Telegraph Company.

Saroyan decided to become a writer after his mother showed him some of his father's writings. A few of his early short articles were published in ''[[Overland Monthly]]''. His first stories appeared in the 1930s. Among these was "The Broken Wheel", written under the name Sirak Goryan and published in the Armenian journal ''[[Hairenik]]'' in 1933. Many of Saroyan's stories were based on his childhood experiences among the Armenian-American fruit growers of the [[San Joaquin Valley]] or dealt with the rootlessness of the immigrant. The short story collection ''My Name is Aram'' (1940), an international bestseller, was about a young boy and the colorful characters of his immigrant family. It has been translated into many languages.

===Career===
As a writer, Saroyan made his breakthrough in ''[[Story (magazine)|Story]]'' magazine with  "[[The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze (short story collection)|The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze]]" (1934), the title taken from the nineteenth-century [[The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze (song)|song of the same title]]. The protagonist — a young, starving writer who tries to survive in a Depression-ridden society — resembles the penniless writer in [[Knut Hamsun]]'s 1890 novel ''[[Hunger (Hamsun novel)|Hunger]]'', but lacks the anger and nihilism of Hamsun's narrator. 
{{quote|Through the air on the flying trapeze, his mind hummed. Amusing it was, astoundingly funny. A trapeze to God, or to nothing, a flying trapeze to some sort of eternity; he prayed objectively for strength to make the flight with grace.}}

The story was republished in a [[The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze (short stories)|collection]] whose royalties enabled Saroyan to travel to Europe and Armenia, where he learned to love the taste of Russian cigarettes, once observing, "You may tend to get cancer from the thing that makes you want to smoke so much, not from the smoking itself" (from ''Not Dying'', 1963). His advice to a young writer was: "Try to learn to breathe deeply; really to taste food when you eat, and when you sleep really to sleep. Try as much as possible to be wholly alive with all your might, and when you laugh, laugh like hell." Saroyan endeavored to create a prose style full of zest for life and seemingly impressionistic, that came to be called "Saroyanesque".

Saroyan's stories celebrated optimism in the midst of the trials and tribulations of the [[Great Depression|Depression]]. He worked rapidly, hardly editing his text, and drinking and gambling away much of his earnings. 
{{quote|I am an estranged man, said the liar: estranged from myself, from my family, my fellow man, my country, my world, my time, and my culture. I am not estranged from God, although I am a disbeliever in everything about God excepting God indefinable, inside all and careless of all.|from ''Here Comes There Goes You Know Who'', 1961}}

[[File:William Saroyan.jpg|thumb|Saroyan in 1940]] 
Saroyan published essays and memoirs, in which he depicted the people he had met on travels in the Soviet Union and Europe, such as the playwright [[George Bernard Shaw]], the Finnish composer [[Jean Sibelius]], and [[Charlie Chaplin]]. In 1952, Saroyan published ''The Bicycle Rider in Beverly Hills'', the first of several volumes of [[memoir]]s. Several other works were drawn from his own experiences, although his approach to autobiographical fact contained a fair bit of [[poetic license]]. Drawn from such deeply personal sources, Saroyan's plays often disregarded the convention that conflict is essential to drama. ''My Heart's in the Highlands'' (1939), his first play, a comedy about a young boy and his Armenian family, was produced at the Guild Theatre in New York. He is probably best remembered for his play ''[[The Time of Your Life]]'' (1939), set in a waterfront saloon in San Francisco. It won a [[Pulitzer Prize]], which Saroyan refused on the grounds that commerce should not judge the arts; he did accept the [[New York Drama Critics' Circle]] award. The play was adapted into a [[The Time of Your Life (film)|1948 film]] starring [[James Cagney]].

Before the war, Saroyan had worked on the screenplay of [[Golden Boy (1939 film)|''Golden Boy'']] (1939), based on [[Clifford Odets]]'s [[Golden Boy (play)|play]], but he never had much success in Hollywood. A second screenplay, ''[[The Human Comedy (film)|The Human Comedy]]'' (1943) is set in the fictional California town of Ithaca in the [[San Joaquin Valley]] (based on Saroyan's memories of [[Fresno]], California), where young [[telegraph]] messenger Homer bears witness to the sorrows and joys of life during [[World War II]].
{{quote|"Mrs. Sandoval," Homer said swiftly, "your son is dead. Maybe it's a mistake. Maybe it wasn't your son. Maybe it was somebody else. The telegram says it was Juan Domingo. But maybe the telegram is wrong ... |from ''The Human Comedy''}}

Having hired Saroyan to write the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] screenplay, [[Louis B. Mayer]] balked at its length, but Saroyan would not compromise and was removed from directing the project. He then turned the script into a novel, publishing it just prior to the release of the film, for which he won the 1943 [[Academy Award for Best Story]]. The novel is often credited as the source for the movie, when in fact the reverse is true. The novel was itself the basis for a [[The Human Comedy (musical)|1983 musical of the same name]]. After his disappointment with the ''[[The Human Comedy (film)|Human Comedy]]'' film project, he never permitted Hollywood screen adaptations of any of his novels, despite his often dire financial straits.

[[File:Saroyan Portrait2ab.jpg|thumb|Autographed portrait of Saroyan]]
Saroyan served in the [[United States Army]] during [[World War II]] and was stationed in [[Astoria, Queens]], spending much of his time at the Lombardy Hotel in Manhattan, far from Army personnel. In 1942, he was posted to London as part of a film unit. He narrowly avoided a [[court martial]] when his novel, ''The Adventures of Wesley Jackson'', was seen as advocating [[pacifism]]. Interest in Saroyan's novels declined after the war, when he was criticized for sentimentality. Freedom, brotherly love, and universal benevolence were for him basic values, but critics considered his [[idealism]] as out of step with the times. He still wrote prolifically, so that one of his readers could ask "How could you write so much good stuff and still write such bad stuff?" In the novellas ''The Assyrian and other stories'' (1950) and in ''The Laughing Matter'' (1953), Saroyan mixed [[allegory|allegorical]] elements within a realistic novel. The plays ''Sam Ego's House'' (1949) and ''The Slaughter of the Innocents'' (1958) were not as successful as his prewar plays. Many of Saroyan's later plays, such as ''The Paris Comedy'' (1960), ''The London Comedy'' (1960), and ''[[Settled Out of Court (play)|Settled Out of Court]]'' (1960), premiered in Europe. Manuscripts of a number of unperformed plays are now at [[Stanford University]] with his other papers.

When [[Ernest Hemingway]] learned that Saroyan had made fun of the controversial non-fiction work ''[[Death in the Afternoon]]'', Hemingway responded: "We've seen them come and go — good ones too,  better ones than you, Mr. Saroyan."

Saroyan also painted.<ref name="anitashapolskygallery.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.anitashapolskygallery.com/saroyan.html|title=William Saroyan|work=Anita Shapolsky Gallery NYC}}</ref> He said: "I made drawings before I learned how to write.

===Personal life===
Saroyan had a correspondence with writer [[Sanora Babb]] that began in 1932 and ended in 1941, that grew into an unrequited love affair on Saroyan's part.<ref name=Balakian>{{cite book|last=Balakian|first=Nona|title=The World of William Saroyan|year=1998|publisher=Bucknell University Press|location=Lewisburg, [Pa.]|isbn=978-0-8387-5368-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/worldofwilliamsa00bala/page/273 273]–275|url=https://archive.org/details/worldofwilliamsa00bala|url-access=registration|edition=2. print.|quote=I have never stopped thinking of you as somebody rare and extraordinary and fine and wonderful and truly beautiful.}}</ref>

In 1943, Saroyan married actress [[Carol Grace]] (1924–2003; also known as Carol Marcus), with whom he had two children: [[Aram Saroyan|Aram]], who became an author and published a book about his father, and [[Lucy Saroyan|Lucy]], who became an actress.<ref>{{cite book | last=Saroyan | first=Aram  | title=Last Rites: The Death of William Saroyan | edition=First | location=New York | publisher=William Morrow & Co | year=1982 | isbn=978-0-688-01262-5}}</ref> By the late 1940s, Saroyan's drinking and gambling took a toll on his marriage, and in 1949, upon returning from an extended European trip, he filed for divorce. They remarried in 1951 and divorced again in 1952 with Marcus later claiming in her autobiography, ''Among the Porcupines: A Memoir'',<ref>{{cite book | last=Matthau | first=Carol | title=Among the Porcupines: A Memoir | edition=First | location=New York | publisher=Turtle Bay Books | year=1992 | isbn=0-394-58266-7 | url=https://archive.org/details/amongporcupinesm00matt }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last=Witchel | first=Alex | title=The Real Holly Golightly | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE0DE143AF93AA25754C0A964958260  | work=The New York Times | date=July 19, 1992 | access-date=December 15, 2008}}</ref> that Saroyan was abusive.

Saroyan died in Fresno, of [[prostate cancer]] at the age of 72. Half of his ashes were buried in California and the remainder in Armenia at the [[Komitas Pantheon]] near fellow artists such as composer [[Aram Khachaturian]], painter [[Martiros Saryan]], and film director [[Sergei Parajanov]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parajanov.com/saroyan.html|title=saroyan|date=February 9, 2017}}</ref>
