==Early life==
[[File:Nazim Hikmet Bahriye.jpg|thumb|left|Nâzım Hikmet in 1917, at the age of 15]]
Ran was born on 15 January 1902, in Selânik (Salonica), where his father was serving as an Ottoman government official.<ref name=Britannica/><ref name=NazimHikmet/> He attended the Taşmektep Primary School in the [[Göztepe, Istanbul|Göztepe]] district of Istanbul and later enrolled in the junior high school section of the prestigious [[Galatasaray High School]] in the [[Beyoğlu]] district, where he began to learn French; however, in 1913, he was transferred to the Numune Mektebi in the [[Nişantaşı]] district. In 1918, he graduated from the [[Naval High School (Turkey)|Ottoman Naval School]] on [[Heybeliada]], one of the [[Princes' Islands]] located in the [[Sea of Marmara]]. His school days coincided with a period of political upheaval, during which the Ottoman government entered the First World War, allying itself with Germany. For a brief period he was assigned as a naval officer to the [[Ottoman Navy|Ottoman]] [[cruiser]] ''[[Ottoman cruiser Hamidiye|Hamidiye]]''; however in 1919 he became seriously ill and, not being able to fully recover, was exempted from naval service in 1920.

In 1921, together with his friends [[Vâlâ Nureddin]] (Vâ-Nû), [[Yusuf Ziya Ortaç]] and [[Faruk Nafiz Çamlıbel]], he went to [[İnebolu]] in [[Anatolia]] in order to join the [[Turkish War of Independence]]; from there he (together with Vâlâ Nûreddin) walked to [[Ankara]], where the Turkish liberation movement was headquartered. In Ankara they were introduced to [[Mustafa Kemal Pasha]] ([[Atatürk]]) who wanted the two friends to write a poem that would invite and inspire Turkish volunteers in Istanbul and elsewhere to join their struggle. This poem was much appreciated, and Muhittin Bey (Birgen) decided to appoint them as teachers to the Sultani (high-college) in [[Bolu]], rather than sending them to the front as soldiers. However, their [[communism|communist]] views were not appreciated by the conservative officials in Bolu, and so the two decided to go to [[Batumi]] in the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic]] to witness the results of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], arriving there on 30 September 1921. In July 1922, the two friends went to [[Moscow]], where Ran studied Economics and Sociology at the [[Communist University of the Toilers of the East]] in the early 1920s. There, he was influenced by the artistic experiments of [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]] and [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]], as well as the ideological vision of [[Lenin]].<ref name=goksu/> 

==Style and achievements==
Despite writing his first poems in syllabic meter, Nazım Hikmet distinguished himself from the "syllabic poets" in concept. With the development of his poetic conception, the narrow forms of [[syllabic verse]] became too limiting for his style and he set out to seek new forms for his poems.

He was influenced by the young Soviet poets who advocated [[futurism (art)|Futurism]]. On his return to Turkey, he became the charismatic leader of the Turkish [[avant-garde]], producing streams of innovative poems, plays and film scripts.<ref name=goksu /> In Moscow in 1922, breaking the boundaries of syllabic meter, he changed his form and began writing in [[free verse]], which harmonized with the rich vocal properties of the [[Turkish language]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Blasing|first=Mutlu Konuk|date=2010|title=Nazim Hikmet and Ezra Pound: "To Confess Wrong without Losing Rightness"|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2979/jml.2010.33.2.1|journal=Journal of Modern Literature|volume=33|issue=2|pages=8|doi=10.2979/jml.2010.33.2.1|jstor=10.2979/jml.2010.33.2.1|s2cid=162349806|issn=0022-281X}}</ref>

He has been compared by Turkish and non-Turkish men of letters to such figures as [[Federico García Lorca]], [[Louis Aragon]], [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], [[Faiz Ahmed Faiz]] and [[Pablo Neruda]]. Although Ran's work bears a resemblance to these poets and owes them occasional debts of form and stylistic device, his literary personality is unique in terms of the synthesis he made of iconoclasm and lyricism, of ideology and poetic diction.<ref name=christie/>{{rp|19}}

Many of his poems have been set to music by the Turkish composer [[Zülfü Livaneli]] and [[Cem Karaca]]. A part of his work has been translated into Greek by [[Yiannis Ritsos]], and some of these translations have been arranged by the Greek composers [[Manos Loizos]] and [[Thanos Mikroutsikos]].

Because of his political views his works were banned in Turkey from 1938 to 1965.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/text/poetrys-place-history-banned-books|title=Poetry's Place in the History of Banned Books|last=mphillips|date=22 September 2015|website=Poetry's Place in the History of Banned Books|language=en|access-date=30 January 2019}}</ref>

==Later life and legacy==
Ran's imprisonment in the 1940s became a ''[[cause célèbre]]'' among intellectuals worldwide; a 1949 committee that included [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Paul Robeson]], and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] campaigned for his release.<ref name="kb">{{Cite web|url=http://www.kultur.gov.tr/EN/Genel/BelgeGoster.aspx?17A16AE30572D313A781CAA92714FCE08F59EC4393613791 |publisher=Ministry of Culture |title=Nazım Hikmet |access-date=7 February 2010 }}</ref>

On 8 April 1950, Ran began a hunger strike in protest against the Turkish parliament's failure to include an amnesty law in its agenda before it closed for the upcoming general election. He was then transferred from the prison in [[Bursa]], first to the infirmary of [[Sultanahmet Jail]] in [[Istanbul]], and later to [[Paşakapısı Prison]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nazimhikmetran.com/english/pages/biyografi5.html |publisher=Nazım Hikmet Ran |title=Life Story -5 |access-date=7 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006042859/http://www.nazimhikmetran.com/english/pages/biyografi5.html |archive-date=6 October 2008  }}</ref> Seriously ill, Ran suspended his strike on 23 April, the [[National Sovereignty and Children's Day]]. His doctor's request to treat him in hospital for three months was refused by officials. So, as his imprisonment status had not changed, he resumed his hunger strike on the morning of 2 May.<ref name="kb"/>

Ran's hunger strike caused a stir throughout the country. Petitions were signed and a magazine named after him was published. His mother, Celile, began a hunger strike on 9 May, followed by renowned Turkish poets [[Orhan Veli]], [[Melih Cevdet]] and [[Oktay Rıfat]] the next day. In light of the new political situation after the [[1950 Turkish general election]], held on 14 May, the strike was ended five days later, on 19 May, Turkey's [[Commemoration of Atatürk, Youth and Sports Day]], he was finally released through a general amnesty law enacted by the new government.<ref name="kb"/>

On 22 November 1950, the [[World Council of Peace]] announced that Nazım Hikmet Ran was among the recipients of the [[International Peace Prize]], along with Pablo Picasso, Paul Robeson, [[Wanda Jakubowska]] and [[Pablo Neruda]].<ref name="kb"/>

Later on, Ran escaped from Turkey to [[Romania]] on a ship via the [[Black Sea]], and from there moved to the [[USSR]]. Because in the Soviet bloc the only recognized Turkish minority existed in communist Bulgaria, the poet's books were immediately brought out in this country, both in Turkish originals<ref>Nazim Hikmet. 1951.

When the [[EOKA]] struggle broke out in [[Cyprus]], Ran believed that the population of Cyprus would be able to live together peacefully, and called on the Turkish minority to support the [[Greek Cypriot]]s' demand for an end to British rule and Union with Greece ([[Enosis]]).<ref>Greek newspaper ''[[I Avgi]]'', 17 January 1955 and ''Phileleftheros'', 31 March 2007:
<blockquote>
Ran sent a message to the Turks of Cyprus emphasizing that Cyprus was always Greek. [...] (The Turkish Cypriots) must support the Greek Cypriots' struggle for liberation from British imperialism. [...] Only when the British imperialists leave the island will its Turkish residents be truly free. [...] Those who encourage Turks to oppose Greeks actually only support the interest of the foreign ruler.

Persecuted for decades by the Republic of Turkey during the [[Cold War]] for his communist views, Ran died of a heart attack in Moscow on 3 June 1963 at 6.30 am while picking up a morning newspaper at the door of his summer house in [[Peredelkino]], far away from his beloved homeland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~sibel/poetry/nazim_hikmet.html|title=Nazim Hikmet|access-date=22 December 2016}}</ref> He is buried in Moscow's famous [[Novodevichy Cemetery]], where his imposing tombstone is still today a place of pilgrimage for Turks and many others from around the world. His final wish, never carried out, was to be buried under a plane-tree ([[platanus]]) in any village cemetery in [[Anatolia]].

Despite his persecution by the Turkish state, Nâzım Hikmet has always been revered by the Turkish nation. His poems depicting the people of the countryside, villages, towns and cities of his homeland (''Memleketimden İnsan Manzaraları'', i.e. ''Human Landscapes from my Country''), as well as the [[Turkish War of Independence]] (''Kurtuluş Savaşı Destanı'', i.e. ''The Epic of the War of Independence''), and the [[Turkish revolutionaries]] (''Kuvâyi Milliye'', i.e. ''Force of the Nation'') are considered among the greatest [[patriotic]] literary works of Turkey.

Following his death, the Kremlin ordered the publication of the poet's first-ever Turkish-language collected works in communist Bulgaria, where at that time a large and still recognized Turkish national minority existed. The eight volumes of these collected works, ''Bütün eserleri'', appeared at [[Sofia]] between 1967 and 1972, that is, in the very last years of the existence of the Turkish minority educational and publishing system in Bulgaria.<ref>Nâzım Hikmet. 1967-1972.

==Patronage==
During the 1940s, as he was serving his sentence at Bursa Prison, he used to paint. There, he met a young inmate named [[İbrahim Balaban]]. Ran discovered Balaban's talent in drawing, gave all his paint and brushes to him, and encouraged him to continue with painting. Ran influenced the peasant, and educated him, who had finished only a three-grade village school, in forming his own ideas in the fields of philosophy, sociology, economics and politics. Ran admired Balaban much, and referred to him in a letter to the novelist [[Kemal Tahir]] as "his peasant painter" ({{lang-tr|Köylü ressam}}). Their contact remained also after they were released from the prison.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.todayszaman.com/news-232270-ibrahim-balaban-celebrates-six-decades-of-art-in-latest-exhibition.html |newspaper=[[Today's Zaman]] |title=İbrahim Balaban celebrates six decades of art in latest exhibition |date=13 January 2011 |access-date=2 May 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503153133/http://www.todayszaman.com/news-232270-ibrahim-balaban-celebrates-six-decades-of-art-in-latest-exhibition.html |archive-date=3 May 2014  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://timeoutbursa.blogspot.com.tr/2012/04/sair-baba-nazimin-koylu-ressami-ibrahim.html |publisher=Time Out Bursa |title=Bursa: Tarihin İçinde Zamanın Ötesinde - Şair Baba Nazım'ın Köylü Ressamı: İbrahim Babaan |date=8 April 2012 |author=Genç, Türkan |language=tr |access-date=2 May 2014}}</ref>

Ran's poem ''Kız Çocuğu'' (''The Girl Child'') conveys a plea for peace from a seven-year-old girl, ten years after she has perished in the [[atomic bomb]] attack at [[Hiroshima]]. It has achieved popularity as an anti-war message and has been performed as a song by a number of singers and musicians both in [[Turkey]] and worldwide; it is also known in English by various other titles, including ''I Come and Stand at Every Door'', ''I Unseen'' and ''Hiroshima Girl''.<ref name=albany.edu>{{cite web|url=http://www.albany.edu/talkinghistory/arch-recent.html|title=Talking History|access-date=22 December 2016}}</ref>

*[[Thanos Mikroutsikos]], in the album ''Politika tragoudia'' (Political songs, 1975) composed a series of Hikmet's poems, adapted in Greek by the poet [[Yiannis Ritsos]].<ref>http://www.stixoi.info/stixoi.php?info=Albums&act=details&album_id=2635</ref>
*[[Manos Loizos]] composed settings of some of Ran's poems, adapted in Greek by [[Yiannis Ritsos]]. They are included in the 1983 disc ''Grammata stin agapimeni'' (Letters to the beloved one).

*The usual tune is a non-traditional melody composed by Jim Waters in 1954 to fit the lyrics of Child 113 ballad ''[[The Great Silkie of Sule Skerry]]'', which was recorded by American folksinger [[Joan Baez]] as ''Silkie'' on her second album [[Joan Baez, Vol. 2]] in 1961.
*According to American activist [[folk musician]] [[Pete Seeger]], Jeanette Turner did a loose English "singable translation" of the poem under a different title, ''I Come And Stand At Every Door'', and sent a note to Seeger asking "Do you think you could make a tune for it?" in the late 1950s. After a week of trial and failure, this English translation was used by Seeger in 1962 with an adaptation of "an extraordinary melody put together by a [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] student James Waters, who had put a new tune to a mystical ballad ''The Great Silkie'' which he couldn't get out of his head, without permission." Seeger wrote in ''[[Where Have All the Flowers Gone]]'': "It was wrong of me. I should have gotten his permission. But it worked. The Byrds made a good recording of it, electric guitars and all."<ref name=Seeger>Seeger describes the story behind his version of the song in his Where Have All the Flowers Gone: A Singer's Stories, Songs, Seeds, Robberies (A Musical Autobiography) (1993): "In the late '50s I got a letter: 'Dear Pete Seeger: I've made what I think is a singable translation of a poem by the Turkish poet, Nazim Hikmet. Do you think you could make a tune for it? (Signed), Jeanette Turner.' I tried for a week. Failed. Meanwhile, I couldn't get out of my head an extraordinary melody put together by a Massachusetts Institute of Technology student who had put a new tune to a mystical ballad The Great Silkie from the Shetland Islands north of Scotland. Without his permission I used his melody for Hikmet's words. It was wrong of me. I should have gotten his permission. But it worked. The Byrds made a good recording of it, electric guitars and all." http://www.albany.edu/talkinghistory/arch-recent.html</ref> Seeger also used the track in his 1999 compilation album ''[[Pete Seeger#Selected discography|Headlines & Footnotes: A Collection Of Topical Songs]]''. Seeger sang the song on 9 August 2013, the 68th anniversary of the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Nagasaki atomic bombing]], on a [[Democracy Now!]] interview.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pete Seeger Marks 68th Anniversary of Hiroshima Bombing By Singing... |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9qzZ0-qkac |work=YouTube |access-date=20 September 2013 |date=9 August 2013}}</ref>

*[[The Byrds]]; the American rock band used the translation on their third album ''[[Fifth Dimension (album)|Fifth Dimension]]'' in 1966.
*[[Roger McGuinn]] of the Byrds later recorded the song with its original lyrics as part of his [[Folk Den]] project.
*[[The Misunderstood]] used the translation, changing the title to 'I Unseen', on a 1969 UK Fontana single, later included in the 1997 anthology album ''[[The Misunderstood discography#Before the Dream Faded|Before The Dream Faded]]'' with their own tune.
*[[Paul Robeson]] recorded the song as "The Little Dead Girl" with another translation.

The song was later covered by
*[[Ivo Watts-Russell]]'s [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]], [[This Mortal Coil]] on their 1991 album ''[[Blood (This Mortal Coil album)|Blood]]'' with vocals of [[Louise Rutkowski]], Deirdre Rutkowski with Tim Freeman and [[1983–1991 (album)|1983–1991]]
*[[The Fall (band)|The Fall]] on their 1997 album ''[[Levitate (The Fall album)|Levitate]]'', albeit omitting the last verse and wrongly attributing writing credits to anon/J Nagle. ''I Come and Stand at Your Door'' listed as "Anon/Nagle", which is an interpretation of the song ''I Come and Stand at Every Door''. "Jap Kid" is an instrumental version of this track.
*[[Silent Stream Of Godless Elegy]], a [[Moravia]]n [[folk metal]] band, on their album ''[[Behind the Shadows]]'' in 1998.

;Japanese
In 2005, famous [[Amami Ōshima]] singer [[Chitose Hajime]] collaborated with [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]] by translating ''Kız Çocuğu'' into Japanese, retitling it  ''[[:tr:s:Shinda Onna-no-ko|Shinda Onna no Ko]]'' [死んだ女の子] "A dead girl"). It was performed live at the [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial|Atomic Bomb Dome]] in Hiroshima on the eve of the 60th Anniversary (5 August 2005) of [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].
