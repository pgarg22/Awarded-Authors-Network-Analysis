'''Caroline Elizabeth Sarah Norton, Lady Stirling-Maxwell''' (''née'' '''Sheridan'''; 22 March 1808 – 15 June 1877) was an active English social reformer and author.<ref name="Perkin26-28">Perkin, pp. 26–28.</ref> She left her husband in 1836, who sued her close friend [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]], then the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] Prime Minister, for [[criminal conversation]] (adultery). The jury threw out the claim, but she failed to gain a divorce and was denied access to her three sons. Norton's campaigning led to the passage of the [[Custody of Infants Act 1839]], the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1857]] and the [[Married Women's Property Act 1870]]. She modelled for the fresco of ''Justice'' in the [[House of Lords]] by [[Daniel Maclise]], who chose her as a famous victim of injustice.

The combined beauty and accomplishments of the Sheridan sisters led to their being collectively referred to as the [[Charities|Three "Graces"]].<ref>Kemble, p. 173.</ref> The eldest, [[Helen Blackwood, Baroness Dufferin and Claneboye|Helen]], was a songwriter who married [[Price Blackwood, 4th Baron Dufferin and Claneboye|Price Blackwood]], the 4th [[Baron Dufferin and Claneboye]]. Through her Norton became the aunt of [[Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava]], later the third [[Governor General of Canada]] and eighth [[Viceroy of India]]. Her younger sister, [[Georgiana Seymour, Duchess of Somerset|Georgiana]], seen as the prettiest, later married [[Edward Seymour, 12th Duke of Somerset]].

In 1827, she married [[George Chapple Norton]], barrister, M.P. for [[Guildford (UK Parliament constituency)|Guildford]], and the younger brother of [[Fletcher Norton, 3rd Baron Grantley|Lord Grantley]].<ref name="Perkin26-28"/><ref name="Scott-Kilvert, p. 614">Scott-Kilvert, p. 614.</ref> George was a jealous and possessive husband given to violent fits of drunkenness. The union quickly proved unhappy due to his mental and physical abuse.<ref name="Strauss, p. 141"/><ref name="Caine, p. 67">Caine, p. 67.</ref> To make matters worse, George was unsuccessful as a barrister and the couple fought bitterly over money.<ref name="Woodham220">Woodham-Smith, p. 220.</ref>

During her early married years, Norton used her beauty, wit and political ties to set herself up as a major society hostess.<ref name="Mitchell219-221"/><ref name="Woodham220"/> Her unorthodox behaviour and candid conversation raised many eyebrows in 19th-century English high society; she made enemies and admirers in almost equal measure.<ref name="Mitchell219-221"/> Among her friends were such literary and political luminaries as [[Samuel Rogers]], [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton|Edward Bulwer-Lytton]], [[Edward John Trelawny|Edward Trelawny]], [[Abraham Hayward]], [[Mary Shelley]], [[Fanny Kemble]], [[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Benjamin Disraeli]], the future King [[Leopold I of Belgium]] and [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire]].<ref name="Scott-Kilvert, p. 614"/><ref>Perkin, p. 85.</ref><ref>Perkins, pp. 19, 26, 48, 84 and 178.</ref> She also claimed in later life to have taken part in the [[Tolpuddle_Martyrs#Transportation,_pardon,_return|Tolpuddle Martyrs protest march]] in 1834.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Fraser |first1=Antonia |title=The case of the married woman : Caroline Norton : a 19th century heroine who wanted justice for women |date=2021 |publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson |location=London |isbn=9781474610926 |pages=42 |edition=1st}}</ref>

Despite his jealousy and pride, George encouraged his wife to use her ties to advance his career. It was through her influence that in 1831 he was made a Metropolitan Police Magistrate.<ref name="Woodham220-221">Woodham-Smith, pp. 220–221.</ref> During those years, Norton turned to prose and poetry as means of releasing her inner emotions and earning money.

==Separation and Melbourne scandal==
In 1836, Norton left her husband.<ref name="Perkin26-28"/><ref name="Mitchell221-223">Mitchell, pp. 221–223.</ref> She managed to subsist on her earnings as an author, but George claimed these as his, arguing this successfully in court.<ref name="Perkin26-28"/><ref name="Yalom186">Yalom, p. 186.</ref> Paid nothing by her husband, her earnings confiscated, Norton used the law to her own advantage.<ref name="Perkin28-72">Perkin, pp. 28 and 72–73.</ref> Running up bills in her husband's name, she told the creditors when they came to collect, that if they wished to be paid, they could sue her husband.<ref name="Perkin28-72"/>

Not long after their separation, George abducted their sons, hiding them with relatives in Scotland and later in [[Yorkshire]], refusing to tell Caroline their whereabouts.<ref name="Caine, p. 67"/><ref name="Stone178"/><ref name="Kertzer, pp. 125–126">Kertzer, pp. 125–126.</ref><ref>Perkin, pp. 26–28 and 96.</ref> George accused Caroline of involvement in an ongoing affair with a close friend, [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]], then [[British Whig Party|Whig]] Prime Minister.<ref name="Caine, p. 67"/><ref name="Mitchell221-223"/> Initially, George demanded £10,000 from Melbourne, but Melbourne refused to be blackmailed and George instead took the Prime Minister to court.<ref name="Perkin26-28"/><ref name="Mitchell219-221"/>

Lord Melbourne wrote to [[Henry Vassall-Fox, 3rd Baron Holland|Lord Holland]], "The fact is [George] is a stupid brute, and she had not temper nor dissimulation enough to enable her to manage him."<ref name="Mitchell221-223"/> Despite this admission, hoping to avert an even worse scandal, he pleaded with Caroline to return to George, insisting that "a woman should never part from her husband whilst she can remain with him."<ref name="Mitchell221-223"/> Lord Melbourne relented a few days later, stating that he understood her decision to leave:

<blockquote>This conduct upon his part seems perfectly unaccountable...You know that I have always counselled you to bear everything and remain to the last. I thought it for the best. I am afraid it is no longer possible. Open breaches of this kind are always to be lamented, but you have the consolation that you have done your utmost to stave this extremity off as long as possible.<ref>Perkins, pp. 83–84.</ref></blockquote>

At the end of a nine-day trial, the jury threw out George's claim, siding with Melbourne,<ref>Mitchell, pp. 223–224.</ref> but the publicity almost brought down the government.<ref>Mitchell, pp. 221–224, 226 and 228.</ref> The scandal eventually died, but not before Norton's reputation was ruined and her friendship with Melbourne destroyed.<ref>Mitchell, pp. 223–224, 226 and 228.</ref><ref>Caine, p. 68.</ref> George continued to keep Caroline from seeing her three sons and blocked her from receiving a divorce.<ref name="Perkin26-28"/> Uner English law in 1836, children were the legal property of their father and there was little Norton could do to regain custody.<ref name="Yalom186"/>

==Political activity==
[[File:Caroline Norton by Frank Stone.jpg|thumb|Caroline Norton, detail of a portrait by [[Frank Stone (painter)|Frank Stone]], c. 1845]]
Norton soon faced an additional tragedy; the death of her youngest son, William, in 1842.<ref name="Woodham220-221"/><ref name="Perkins166">Perkins, p. 166.</ref> The child, out riding alone, fell from his horse and was injured.<ref name="Caine, p. 67"/> According to Norton, the child's wounds were minor, but they were not properly treated and blood-poisoning set in.<ref name="Perkins166"/> George, realising that the child was near death, sent for Caroline. Unfortunately, William died before she arrived in Scotland.<ref name="Woodham220-221"/><ref>Perkins, p. 167.</ref> Caroline blamed George for the child's death, accusing him of neglect.<ref name="Woodham220-221"/> After William's death, George allowed Caroline to visit their sons, but he retained full custody and all of her visits were supervised.<ref name="Caine, p. 67"/>

Due to her dismal domestic situation, Norton became deeply involved in the passage of laws promoting social justice, especially those granting rights to married and divorced women.<ref name="Perkin26-28"/><ref name="Strauss, p. 141"/><ref name="Yalom186"/><ref name="Kertzer, pp. 125–126"/> Her poems "A Voice from the Factories" (1836) and "The Child of the Islands" (1845) centred on her political views.

When Parliament debated divorce reform in 1855, Norton submitted to members a detailed account of her own marriage, and described the difficulties faced by women as the result of existing laws.
<blockquote>An English wife may not leave her husband's house. Not only can he sue her for restitution of "conjugal rights," but he has a right to enter the house of any friend or relation with whom she may take refuge...and carry her away by force...

If her husband take proceedings for a divorce, she is not, in the first instance, allowed to defend herself...She is not represented by attorney, nor permitted to be considered a party to the suit between him and her supposed lover, for "damages."

If an English wife be guilty of infidelity, her husband can divorce her so as to marry again; but she cannot divorce the husband, a vinculo, however profligate he may be....

Those dear children, the loss of whose pattering steps and sweet occasional voices made the silence of [my] new home intolerable as the anguish of death...what I suffered respecting those children, God knows ... under the evil law which suffered any man, for vengeance or for interest, to take baby children from the mother.<ref name="Stone178">Stone, p. 178</ref><ref>Yalom, pp. 186–187.</ref>
</blockquote>

Mainly through Norton's intense campaigning,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wroath |first=John |title=Until They Are Seven, The Origins of Women's Legal Rights |year=1998 |publisher=Waterside Press |isbn=1-872-870-57-0 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/untiltheyareseve00wroa}}</ref> which included a letter to Queen Victoria,<ref>{{Citation |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/norton_caroline.shtml|title=Caroline Norton (1808–1877) |publisher=BBC |access-date=23 August 2017}}</ref> Parliament passed the [[Custody of Infants Act 1839]], the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1857]] and the [[Married Women's Property Act 1870]],<ref name="Stone178"/><ref name="Kertzer, pp. 125–126"/> which she worked on with the suffragette activist [[Barbara Bodichon]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://spartacus-educational.com/Wbodichon.htm |title=Barbara Bodichon |website=Spartacus Educational |language=en |access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref> One recent biographer, [[Diane Atkinson]], notes that unlike in 1839 and 1857, Norton played no part in campaigning for the 1870 Act.<ref name="Atkinson415">Atkinson, p. 415.</ref> Under the Custody of Children Act, legally separated or divorced wives, provided they were not found guilty of criminal conversation, were granted the custody of their children up to the age of seven, and periodic access thereafter. The Act applied in England, Wales and Ireland only. While Norton could have hoped for custody of her youngest son, and access to her older sons who were seven and ten when the Act was passed into law, her husband insisted that they stay in Scotland.

The Act gave married women, for the first time, a right to their children. However, because women needed to petition in the Court of Chancery, in practice few women had the financial means to exert their rights.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Atkinson |first=Diane |title=The Criminal Conversation of Mrs Norton |year=2012 |publisher=Random House |page=[https://archive.org/details/criminalconversa0000atki/page/274 274] |isbn=9781848093010 |url=https://archive.org/details/criminalconversa0000atki/page/274}}</ref> The Matrimonial Causes Act reformed the law on divorce, among others making divorce more affordable, and established a model of marriage based on contract. The Married Women's Property Act 1870 allowed married women to inherit property and take court action on their own behalf. The Act granted married women in the UK, for the first time, a separate legal identity from their husband.<ref name="Yalom186"/><ref>Perkin, p. 27.</ref>

In 1849 [[Daniel Maclise]] finished his fresco of ''Justice'' in the [[House of Lords]], for which Norton had modelled. He chose her as one seen by many as a famous victim of injustice.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/victorian-literature-and-culture/article/abs/transfigurations-of-caroline-norton/81DDB9B379BB89496D3142DE49F2F27F |first=Kieran |last=Dolin |title=The Transfigurations of Caroline Norton |date=22 September 2002 |journal=Victorian Literature and Culture |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=503–527 |via=Cambridge University Press |doi=10.1017/S1060150302302079h|s2cid=59424668 }}</ref> Norton's old friend Lord Melbourne opposed the reforms she fought for.<ref name="Mitchell226">Mitchell, p. 226.</ref> He was scolded for his opposition by [[Queen Victoria]]; the Queen wrote that he defended his actions, stating: "I don't think you should give a woman too much right... there should not be two conflicting powers... a man ought to have the right in a family."<ref name="Mitchell226"/>

While Norton fought to extend women's legal rights, she eschewed further social activism and had no interest in the 19th-century women's movement on issues such as [[women's suffrage]].<ref>Caine, pp. 57, 66 and 68.</ref> In fact, in an article published in ''[[The Times]]'' in 1838, she countered a claim that she was a "radical": "The natural position of woman is inferiority to man. Amen! That is a thing of God's appointing, not of man's devising. I believe it sincerely, as part of my religion. I never pretended to the wild and ridiculous doctrine of equality."<ref>Stone, p. 263.</ref>

==Later life==
Norton is said to have had a five-year affair with a prominent [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician [[Sidney Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Lea|Sidney Herbert]] in the early 1840s, but Herbert married another woman in 1846.<ref name="Woodham221">Woodham-Smith, p. 221</ref> In middle age, she befriended the author [[George Meredith]].<ref>Mitchell, p. 220.</ref> She served as the inspiration for Diana Warwick, the intelligent, fiery-tempered heroine of Meredith's novel ''[[Diana of the Crossways]]'', published in 1885.<ref name="Woodham221"/> Norton finally became free with George's death in 1875. She married an old friend, the Scottish historical writer and politician [[William Stirling-Maxwell|Sir W. Stirling Maxwell]] in March 1877. Norton died in London three months later.<ref name="Barron5">Barron, p. 5.</ref><ref>Perkins, p. 296.</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=7NRRIK2XgiFA5pusiDn0TA&scan=1 |title=Index entry |accessdate=30 March 2014 |work=FreeBMD |publisher=ONS}}</ref>

==Family and descendants==
Norton's eldest son, Fletcher Norton, died of [[tuberculosis]] in Paris at the age of 30. She was devastated by the loss.<ref>Perkins, p. 265.</ref>

In 1854, her remaining son, Thomas Brinsley Norton, married a young Italian, Maria Chiara Elisa Federigo, whom he met in [[Naples]].<ref name="Perkins253">Perkins, p. 253.</ref> Thomas also suffered from poor health, and spent much of his life as an invalid, reliant upon his mother for financial assistance.<ref name="Perkins253"/> Despite this, he lived long enough to succeed his uncle as 4th Baron Grantley of Markenfield.<ref name="Barron5"/> Lord Grantley also predeceased his mother, dying in 1877.

His son, [[John Norton, 5th Baron Grantley|John]], inherited the title and estates.<ref>MacColl pp. 239 and 342</ref> The 5th Lord Grantley was a [[numismatist]], and a Fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]], the [[Royal Numismatic Society]] and the [[British Numismatic Society]]. He assembled a large collection of coins and grew orchids. Caroline Norton's grandson caused a scandal in 1879 by running off with another man's wife, the former Katharine McVickar, daughter of a wealthy American stockbroker.<ref>MacColl, pp. 239–240 and 342.</ref> The jilted husband was the 5th Lord Grantley's older cousin, Major Charles Grantley Campbell Norton.<ref>MacColl, p. 239.</ref> Katharine's marriage to Charles was annulled, and Katharine and John were married that November, five days before the birth of their first child.<ref>MacColl, p. 342.</ref> Despite her scandalous introduction to British society, Katharine went on to become a successful London hostess.<ref>MacColl, p. 240.</ref>

==Commemoration==
In April 2021 [[English Heritage]] announced that Norton was one of six women to be honoured that year with a [[blue plaque]] marking her central London home for over 30 years.<ref>{{Cite web |title=English Heritage announces six more blue plaques to women for 2021 |url=https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/about-us/search-news/six-new-blue-plaques/ |access-date=2021-04-05 |website=English Heritage}}</ref> It was unveiled on 3 Chesterfield Street, Mayfair by [[Antonia Fraser]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-04-29 |title=Blue plaque honours Caroline Norton, 'unsung hero of women's rights' |url=http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/apr/29/blue-plaque-honours-caroline-norton-unsung-hero-of-womens-rights |access-date=2021-05-20 |website=The Guardian |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Cope |first=Rebecca |title=Lady Antonia Fraser unveils blue plaque to Caroline Norton, 19th century women's rights campaigner |url=https://www.tatler.com/article/caroline-norton-blue-plaque |access-date=2021-05-20 |website=Tatler |language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Caroline Norton {{!}} Campaigner for women’s rights {{!}} English Heritage {{!}} Blue Plaques |url=https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/blue-plaques/caroline-norton |access-date=2021-05-20 |website=English Heritage}}</ref>
