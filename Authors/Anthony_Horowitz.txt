Horowitz was born in [[Stanmore]], [[Middlesex]], into a [[Jewish]] family, and in his early years lived an [[upper middle class]] lifestyle.<ref name="horosons">{{cite web|author=Purdon, Fiona|date=14 November 2008|title=Anthony Horowitz has lost his role models for Alex Rider|url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,24641071-7642,00.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20121230170325/http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,24641071-7642,00.html|archive-date=30 December 2012|access-date=6 December 2008|work=[[The Courier-Mail]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anthonyhorowitz.com/about/ |title=Anthony Horowitz – About Anthony |access-date=6 December 2008 |author=Horowitz, Anthony |publisher=AnthonyHorowitz.com| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081216080906/http://www.anthonyhorowitz.com/about/| archive-date= 16 December 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref name="jewishexpotent">{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishexponent.com/article/10950/ |title=Horowitz ...

Horowitz started writing at the age of 8 or 9 and he instantly "knew" he would be a professional writer. This was because he was an underachiever in school and was not physically fit, and found his escape in books and telling stories. In a 2006 interview Horowitz stated "I was quite certain, from my earliest memory, that I would be a professional writer and nothing but."<ref>{{Cite web|title=An Interview With Anthony Horowitz {{!}} Scholastic|url=http://www.scholastic.com/teachers/articles/teaching-content/interview-anthony-horowitz/|access-date=2020-06-17|website=www.scholastic.com}}</ref>

At age 13 he went to [[Rugby School]], a [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]] in [[Rugby, Warwickshire]]. Horowitz's mother introduced him to ''Frankenstein'' and ''Dracula''. She also gave him a human skull for his 13th birthday. Horowitz said in an interview that it reminds him to get to the end of each story since he will soon look like the skull.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/22/my-writing-day-anthony-horowitz|title=Anthony Horowitz: 'I don't have breakfast.

In at least one interview, Horowitz claims to believe that [[H. P. Lovecraft]] based his fictional ''[[Necronomicon]]'' on a real text, and to have read some of that text.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scholastic.com/teachers/articles/teaching-content/anthony-horowitz-q/ |title=Anthony Horowitz Q & A: ''Did you make up the Old Ones?'' |publisher=.scholastic.com |access-date=10 June 2012}}</ref>

Horowitz's father was associated with some of the politicians in the "circle" of prime minister [[Harold Wilson]], including [[Eric Miller (businessman)|Eric Miller]].<ref>{{cite interview | last= Horowitz |first= Anthony |title=Loose Ends |publisher=BBC Radio 4 |date= 23 March 2013 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01rft4c| access-date = 23 March 2013 }}</ref> Facing bankruptcy, he moved his assets into [[Swiss bank|Swiss numbered bank accounts]]. He died from [[cancer]] when Horowitz was 22, and the family was never able to track down the missing money despite years of trying.<ref name="jewishexpotent"/>

Horowitz now lives in Central London with his wife Jill Green, whom he married in [[Hong Kong]] on 15 April 1988. Green produced ''Foyle's War'', the series Horowitz wrote for [[ITV Network|ITV]]. They have two sons. He credits his family with much of his success in writing, as he says they help him with ideas and research. He is a patron of family support charity, Home-Start in Suffolk and child protection charity [[Kidscape]].<ref>[http://www.kidscape.org.uk/info/staffpatronlist.asp Kidscape Staff, Trustees, Patrons, Volunteers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524030923/http://www.kidscape.org.uk/info/staffpatronlist.asp |date=24 May 2011 }}, [http://www.kidscape.org.uk/ Kidscape], UK.</ref>

Politically, he considers himself to be "vaguely conservative".<ref>{{cite tweet |last=Horowitz |first=Anthony |author-link=Anthony Horowitz |user=AnthonyHorowitz |number=447073029278150656 |date=21 March 2014 |title=@griffsimon Not sure I support any of them but vaguely conservative, I suppose. |language=en |access-date=4 January 2021}}</ref> Ahead of the [[2010 United Kingdom general election]], Horowitz stated he would vote for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in response to the then policies of the governing Labour Party but "with little enthusiasm."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/anthony-horowitz-labour-has-done-all-it-can-to-demonise-our-children-1921044.html|title=Anthony Horowitz: 'Labour has done all it can to demonise our|date=23 October 2011}}</ref> In 2017, Horowitz expressed criticism of the notion of [[cultural appropriation]] after a publisher had allegedly tried to dissuade him from creating a black character as a central figure in one of his novels, and supported fellow author [[Lionel Shriver]]'s critiques on the same issue. He also criticised the social phenomenon of [[cancel culture]] and "mobbing" of figures for expressing different opinions, stating "There is a rigidity in the way we have begun to think and speak. If we step outside certain lines on certain issues, we find not just people disagreeing, but disagreeing to the extent of death threats. When somebody says something untoward in the press, and I am not saying this about myself, people don’t just say that was a stupid thing to say. They say, ''Lose your job.''

==Writing career==

=== 1979–1991: Early work ===

Anthony Horowitz's first book, ''[[The Sinister Secret of Frederick K Bower]]'', was a humorous adventure for children that was published in 1979<ref>Anthony Horowitz. ''The Sinister Secret of Frederick K. Bower'' (London: Arlington Books, 1979)</ref> and later reissued as ''Enter Frederick K Bower'' in 1985. In 1981 his second novel, ''Misha, the Magician and the Mysterious Amulet'' was published and he moved to Paris to write his third book.<ref>Anthony Horowitz. ''Misha, the Magician and the Mysterious Amulet'' (London: Arlington Books, 1981)</ref> In 1983 the first of the ''Pentagram'' series, ''The Devil's Door-Bell'', was released. This story saw Martin Hopkins battling an ancient evil that threatened the whole world. Only three of four remaining stories in the series were ever written: ''[[The Night of the Scorpion]]'' (1984), ''The Silver Citadel'' (1986) and ''Day of the Dragon'' (1986). In 1985, he released ''Myths and Legends'', a collection of retold tales from around the world.

In between writing these novels, Horowitz turned his attention to legendary characters, working with [[Richard Carpenter (screenwriter)|Richard Carpenter]] on the ''[[Robin of Sherwood]]'' television series, writing five episodes of the third season. He also novelised three of Carpenter's episodes as a children's book under the title ''Robin Sherwood: The Hooded Man'' (1986). In addition, he created ''[[Crossbow (TV series)|Crossbow]]'' (1987), a half-hour action adventure series loosely based on [[William Tell]]. This era in Horowitz's career also saw ''Adventurer'' (1987), a thriller about a convict stuck on a prisoner ship with his sworn enemy, and ''[[Starting Out (UK TV series)|Starting Out]]'' (1990), a collection of screenplays by the author himself, published.

In 1988, ''[[Groosham Grange]]'' was published. Its central character is a thirteen-year-old "witch", David Eliot, gifted as the [[seventh son of a seventh son]]. This book went on to win the 1989 [[Lancashire Children's Book of the Year|Lancashire Children's Book of the Year Award]].<ref name="cboty">{{cite web|title=Lancashire Children's Book of the Year|url=http://www.lancashire.gov.uk/libraries/services/children/cboty/cbotyhistory.asp|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626205848/http://www.lancashire.gov.uk/libraries/services/children/cboty/cbotyhistory.asp|archive-date=26 June 2007}}</ref> Some similarities were made between this book and J. K. Rowling’s newer ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series, but Horowitz did not choose to take action because of this.<ref>{{Cite web|title=YOZONE : Anthony Horowitz sur la Yozone - (Cyberespace de l'imaginaire|url=http://www.yozone.fr/spip.php?article2813|access-date=2021-06-07|website=www.yozone.fr}}</ref> 

Despite this, the most major release of Horowitz's early career was ''[[The Falcon's Malteser]]'' (1986). This book was the first in the successful ''[[The Diamond Brothers|Diamond Brothers]]'' series, and was filmed for television in 1989 as ''[[Just Ask for Diamond]]'', with an all-star cast that included [[Bill Paterson (actor)|Bill Paterson]], [[Jimmy Nail]], [[Roy Kinnear]], [[Susannah York]], [[Michael Robbins]] and [[Patricia Hodge]], and featured Colin Dale and [[Dursley McLinden]] as Nick and Tim Diamond respectively. It was followed in 1987 with ''[[Public Enemy Number Two]]'', and by ''South by South East'' in 1991.

=== 1992–1999 ===

Horowitz wrote many stand-alone novels in the 1990s. His 1994 novel ''Granny,'' a comedy thriller about an evil grandmother, was Horowitz's first book in three years, and it was the first of three books for an audience similar to that of ''Groosham Grange''. The second of these was ''The Switch'', a body swap story, first published in 1996. The third was 1997's ''[[The Devil and His Boy]]'', which is set in the [[Elizabethan era]] and explores the rumour of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s secret son.

In 1999, ''[[Return to Groosham Grange|The Unholy Grail]]'' was published as a sequel to ''Groosham Grange''. It was later renamed ''Return to Groosham Grange'' in 2003, possibly to help young readers understand the connection between the two books. In 2021, Horowitz revealed to a fan on [[Twitter]] that he had plans to write a third book, but was dissuaded after the success of the ''Harry Potter'' series''.''<ref>{{Cite web|title=https://twitter.com/anthonyhorowitz/status/1393624307876704256|url=https://twitter.com/anthonyhorowitz/status/1393624307876704256|access-date=2021-05-15|website=Twitter|language=en}}</ref> In the same year, Horowitz publishing a collection of several short horror stories aimed for children and young adults, entitled ''[[Horowitz Horror]]'' (1999). This was an opportunity for Horowitz to further explore a darker side of his writing.

Sometime before the [[new millennium]], Horowitz attempted to reach out to an adult audience with a novel called ''Poisoned Pen.'' The novel is based around Martin Holland, who is a childhood friend of a 21st century incarnation of William Shakespeare. In the novel, William Shakespeare is reimagined as a Hollywood screenwriter who is murdered in a set of circumstances that Martin Holland finds rather odd, despite attempts from a [[Los Angeles]] detective to dissuade him. The novel follows Martin’s attempts to solve the ever-growing mystery through a series of rather unusual circumstances and a number of people who seem rather glad that Shakespeare was murdered. The novel has never been published in the UK or even in English, but copies in Spanish and Dutch have been released (retitled as ''El asesinato de Shakespeare'' and ''William S.'' respectively).<ref>{{Cite web|title=https://twitter.com/anthonyhorowitz/status/1400677048117497862|url=https://twitter.com/anthonyhorowitz/status/1400677048117497862|access-date=2021-06-07|website=Twitter|language=en}}</ref> As of June 2021, there are no plans to get the novel republished.

=== 2000–present ===

Horowitz began his most famous and successful series in the new millennium with the [[Alex Rider]] novels. These books are about a 14-year-old boy becoming a [[spy]], a member of the British Secret Service branch MI6. As of 2021, there are eleven books where Alex Rider is the protagonist, and another connected to the Alex Rider series: ''[[Stormbreaker (novel)|Stormbreaker]]'' (2000), ''[[Point Blanc]]'' (2001), ''[[Skeleton Key (novel)|Skeleton Key]]'' (2002), ''[[Eagle Strike]]'' (2003), ''[[Scorpia (novel)|Scorpia]]'' (2004) ''[[Ark Angel]]'' (2005), ''[[Snakehead (novel)|Snakehead]]'' (2007), ''[[Crocodile Tears (novel)|Crocodile Tears]]'' (2009), ''[[Scorpia Rising]]'' (2011), plus ''[[Russian Roulette (novel)|Russian Roulette]]'' (2013).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://anthonyhorowitz.com/newscentre/alexrider/february-nightrise-walker-books-and-snakehead/26/ |title=News – Nightrise, Walker Books and Snakehead |website=anthonyhorowitz.com |access-date=10 June 2012}}</ref> Horowitz had stated that ''Scorpia Rising'' was to be the last book in the Alex Rider series prior to writing ''Russian Roulette'' about the life of [[Yassen Gregorovich]],<ref>[http://anthonyhorowitz.com/newscentre/category/alexrider/) ''Scorpia Rising'']{{dead link|date=May 2014}} Horowitz official site</ref> but he has returned to the series with ''Never Say Die'' (2017) and ''Nightshade'' (2020) and is in the midst of writing a new Alex Rider novel that is due to be published sometime in 2022.

In 2003, Horowitz also wrote three novellas featuring the Diamond Brothers: ''The Blurred Man'', ''[[The French Confection]]'' and ''[[I Know What You Did Last Wednesday]]'', which were republished together as ''[[Three of Diamonds]]'' in 2004. The author information page in early editions of ''[[Alex Rider#Scorpia|Scorpia]]'' and the introduction to ''[[Three of Diamonds]]'' claimed that Horowitz had travelled to Australia to research a new Diamond Brothers book, entitled ''Radius of the Lost Shark''. This claim was further backed up when a new Diamond Brothers novella entitled ''The Greek who Stole Christmas!'' was released in 2007, where it is hinted at the end that ''Radius of the Lost Shark'' may turn out to be the eighth book in the series.<ref>[http://www.redhouse.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/product_10151_18251_95165_100_17604_17604_category_ The Greek Who Stole Christmas] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109134950/http://www.redhouse.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/product_10151_18251_95165_100_17604_17604_category_ |date=9 November 2007 }} by Anthony Horowitz, [http://www.redhouse.co.uk/ Red House Books] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303125221/http://www.redhouse.co.uk/ |date=3 March 2012 }}, UK.</ref> However, the next novel in the series is instead called ''Where Seagulls Dare'', and is unrelated to the Australian-based adventure that was previously announced. Horowitz published the first six chapters unedited on his website throughout 2020, and intends for the full, edited novel to be published in 2022, with all profits going to support the [[National Health Service|NHS]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-04-26|title=WHERE SEAGULLS DARE - Diamond Brothers - Read the first Chapter Now! {{!}} News|url=https://anthonyhorowitz.com/news/story/where-seagulls-dare-diamond-brothers-read-the-first-chapter-now|access-date=2021-04-13|website=Anthony Horowitz|language=en}}</ref>

Horowitz also published two sequels to his short horror story collection; ''[[More Horowitz Horror]]'' (2000) and ''More Bloody Horowitz'' (2009). Many of the stories in ''Horowitz Horror'' and ''More Horowitz Horror'' were later repackaged in twos or threes as the ''Pocket Horowitz'' series, while ''More Bloody Horowitz'' was later reissued as ''Scared to Death''. One of the short stories in ''More Bloody Horowitz'' is notable for serving as Horowitz’s opportunity to get even with fellow author [[Darren O'Shaughnessy]], more commonly known as Darren Shan. In 2008, the pair had gotten into a joke dispute over O'Shaughnessy’s use of Horowitz’s name for an objectionable character (Antoine Horwitzer) in [[Wolf Island (novel)|''Wolf Island'']].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Wolf Island - Darren Shan - Author|url=https://darrenshan.com/books/details/Wolf_Island|access-date=2021-05-13|website=darrenshan.com}}</ref> In retaliation, Horowitz chose to plot a gruesome literary revenge in the short story ''The Man Who Killed Darren Shan.''<ref>{{Cite web|date=2008-10-28|title=NECROPOLIS, NEW YORK AND A QUESTION: SHOULD I SUE DARREN SHAN? {{!}} News|url=https://anthonyhorowitz.com/news/story/necropolis-new-york-and-a-question-should-i-sue-darren-shan/73|access-date=2021-05-13|website=Anthony Horowitz|language=en}}</ref>

In 2004, Horowitz again branched out to an adult audience with ''[[The Killing Joke (novel)|The Killing Joke]]'', a comedy about a man who tries to track a joke to its source with disastrous consequences. The book was not very successful, and in August 2005, Horowitz returned to young adult fiction by releasing a book called ''[[Raven's Gate]]'' which began a second successful series entitled ''[[The Power of Five]]'' (''The Gatekeepers'' in the United States). Based heavily on one of his earlier novels entitled ''The Devil's Door-Bell'', each of the first four entries of ''The Power of Five'' subsequently ended up being a rewritten and expanded version of their respective counterpart from the ''Pentagram'' series. The second book in the series, ''[[Evil Star (novel)|Evil Star]]'' (based on ''The Night of the Scorpion'')'','' was released in April 2006. The third in the series is called ''[[Nightrise]]'' (based on ''The Silver Citadel''), and was released on 2 April 2007. The fourth book ''[[Necropolis (2008 novel)|Necropolis]]'' (based on ''Day of the Dragon'') was released in October 2008. The fifth and final book, the only one not based on an earlier ''Pentagram'' novel, was released in October 2012 and is named ''[[Oblivion (Power of Five)|Oblivion]]''. Horowitz describes this series as "Alex Rider with devils and witches".<ref name="ahorowitz2">{{cite web|title=News - January 2005|url=http://www.anthonyhorowitz.com/news/archive/jan2005.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060323022301/http://www.anthonyhorowitz.com/news/archive/jan2005.html|archive-date=23 March 2006|website=anthonyhorowitz.com}}</ref>

Having previously spoken about the book in 2005, the book was initially described as being about "a whodunit writer who is murdered while he's writing his latest whodunit".<ref name="orionbooks">{{cite web |title=Anthony Horowitz, author of The Killing Joke, answers our questions |url=http://www.orionbooks.co.uk/QandA.aspx?id=10964&catID=0 |publisher=Orion Publishing Group |access-date=12 October 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927012039/http://www.orionbooks.co.uk/QandA.aspx?id=10964&catID=0 |archive-date=27 September 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Horowitz finally expected to finish it in late 2015,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/after-penning-sherlock-holmes-novel-moriarty-anthony-horowitz-is-set-to-tackle-james-bond-9799095.html|title=First Sherlock, now Bond: Why Anthony Horowitz is on a roll|date=16 October 2014|work=independent.co.uk}}</ref> and it was finally published in October 2016.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Orion Publishing Group |title=Author of MORIARTY and TRIGGER MORTIS, Anthony Horowitz offers up a whodunit like no other in this fiendishly clever new novel |url=https://www.orionbooks.co.uk/books/detail.page?isbn=9781409158363 |access-date=10 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312072907/https://www.orionbooks.co.uk/books/detail.page?isbn=9781409158363 |archive-date=12 March 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  A follow-up novel, ''Moonflower Murders'', was released in 2020. A third and final novel in the series is expected to be released as well.

Horowitz was appointed [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the [[2014 New Year Honours]] for services to literature.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=60728 |supp=y|page=12|date=31 December 2013}}</ref>

=== Writing for television and film ===
Horowitz began writing for television in the 1980s, contributing to the children's anthology series ''[[Dramarama (television)|Dramarama]]'', and also writing for the popular fantasy series ''[[Robin of Sherwood]]''. His association with murder mysteries began with the adaptation of several [[Hercule Poirot]] stories for [[ITV Network|ITV]]'s popular ''[[Agatha Christie's Poirot]]'' series during the 1990s.

Often his work has a comic edge, such as with the comic murder anthology ''[[Murder Most Horrid]]'' (BBC Two, 1991) and the comedy-drama ''The Last Englishman'' (1995), starring [[Jim Broadbent]]. From 1997, he wrote the majority of the episodes in the early series of ''[[Midsomer Murders]]''. In 2001, he created a drama anthology series of his own for the BBC, ''Murder in Mind'', an occasional series which deals with a different set of characters and a different murder every one-hour episode.

He is also less-favourably known for the creation of two short-lived and sometimes derided [[science fiction on television|science-fiction shows]], ''[[Crime Traveller]]'' (1997) for BBC One and ''The Vanishing Man'' (pilot 1996, series 1998) for [[ITV Network|ITV]]. While ''Crime Traveller'' received favourable viewing figures it was not renewed for a second season, which Horowitz accounts to temporary personnel transitioning within the BBC. In 2002, the detective series ''[[Foyle's War]] ''launched, set during the [[Second World War]].

He devised the 2009 ITV crime drama ''[[Collision (TV series)|Collision]]'' and co-wrote the screenplay with [[Michael A. Walker]].

Horowitz is the writer of a feature film screenplay, ''[[The Gathering (2003 film)|The Gathering]]'', which was released in 2003 and starred [[Christina Ricci]]. He wrote the screenplay for Alex Rider's first major motion picture, ''[[Stormbreaker (film)|Stormbreaker]]''.

Horowitz is adapting his novel ''The Magpie Murders'' into a television miniseries, to air on [[BritBox]] in the UK and on the [[PBS]] series ''Masterpiece [[Mystery!]]'' in the US.<ref name= "magpietv">{{cite news |last=Halleman |first=Caroline |url= https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/arts-and-culture/a33404686/magpie-murders-pbs-show/ |title=Anthony Horowitz's bestselling novel is being adapted for Masterpiece PBS. |work=[[Town & Country (magazine)|Town & Country]] |date=23 July 2020|access-date=6 August 2020}}</ref>
