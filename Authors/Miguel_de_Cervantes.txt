Much of his life was spent in poverty and obscurity, while the bulk of his surviving work was produced in the three years preceding his death, when he was supported by the [[Count of Lemos]] and did not have to work. Despite this, his influence and literary contribution are reflected by the fact that Spanish is often referred to as "the language of Cervantes".<ref>{{cite web|title=La lengua de Cervantes |language=es |url=http://www.cepc.es/rap/Publicaciones/Revistas/2/REP_031-032_288.pdf |publisher=Ministerio de la Presidencia de España |access-date=14 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003083955/http://www.cepc.es/rap/Publicaciones/Revistas/2/REP_031-032_288.pdf |archive-date=3 October 2008 }}</ref>

[[File: An Incident in the story of Don Quixote, by Robert Hillingford.jpg|thumb|''An incident in the story of'' Don Quixote (1870), by English painter [[Robert Hillingford]], depicts a scene from Cervantes's ''magnum opus''.]]

In 1569, Cervantes was forced to leave Spain and moved to Rome, where he worked in the household of a [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinal]]. In 1570, he enlisted in a [[Spanish Marine Infantry|Spanish Navy infantry]] regiment, and was badly wounded at the [[Battle of Lepanto]] in October 1571. He served as a soldier until 1575, when he was captured by [[Barbary pirates]]; after five years in captivity, he was ransomed, and returned to [[Madrid]].

His first significant novel, titled ''[[La Galatea]]'', was published in 1585, but he continued to work as a purchasing agent, then later a government [[Farm (revenue leasing)|tax collector]]. Part One of ''Don Quixote'' was published in 1605, Part Two in 1615. Other works include the 12 ''[[Novelas ejemplares]]'' (''Exemplary Novels''); a long poem, the ''[[Viaje del Parnaso]]'' (''Journey to Parnassus''); and ''Ocho comedias y ocho entremeses'' (''Eight Plays and Eight [[Interlude]]s''). ''[[Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda]]'' (''The Travails of Persiles and Sigismunda''), was published posthumously in 1616.

==Biography==
[[File:Alcalá de Henares (RPS 08-11-2014) Plaza de Cervantes.png|thumb|''Santa María la Mayor'', in [[Alcalá de Henares]], where Cervantes was reputedly baptised; the square in front is named ''Plaza Cervantes'']]
Despite his subsequent renown, much of Cervantes's life is uncertain, including his name, background and what he looked like. Although he signed himself ''Cerbantes'', his printers used ''Cervantes'', which became the common form. In later life, Cervantes used ''Saavedra'', the name of a distant relative, rather than the more usual ''Cortinas'', after his mother.{{sfn|Garcés|2002|p=189}} But historian [[Luce López-Baralt]], claimed that it comes from the word «shaibedraa» that in crippled Arabic dialect is ''single-handed'', his nickname during his captivity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.es/cultura/cultural/abci-luce-lopez-baralt-ante-quijote-y-san-juan-cruz-siento-vertigo-asomarme-abismo-sin-201611170144_noticia.html|title=Luce López-Baralt: "Ante el 'Quijote' y San Juan de la Cruz siento el vértigo de asomarme a un abismo sin fin"|date=17 November 2016|website=abc}}</ref>

Another area of dispute is his religious background. It has been suggested that not only Cervantes's father but also his mother may have been [[New Christians]].{{sfn|Byron|1978|p=32}}{{sfn|Lokos|2016|p=116}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/miguel-de-cervantes-saavedra|title=Miguel De Cervantes Saavedra|author= Encyclopaedia Judaica|date=2008|website=jewishvirtuallibrary}}</ref> According to Anthony Cascardi "While the family might have had some claim to nobility they often found themselves in financial straits. Moreover, they were almost certainly of converso origin, that is, converts to Catholicism of Jewish ancestry. In the Spain of Cervantes' days, this meant living under clouds of official suspicion and social mistrust, with far more limited opportunities than were enjoyed by members of the ‘Old Christian’ caste."<ref>{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Cervantes|author=Anthony J. Cascardi|publisher=Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK|date= 2008|page= 4}}</ref>

It is generally accepted Miguel de Cervantes was born around 29 September 1547, in [[Alcalá de Henares]]. He was the second son of [[barber-surgeon]] Rodrigo de Cervantes and his wife, Leonor de Cortinas ({{circa|1520–1593}}).{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=35}} Rodrigo came from [[Córdoba, Andalusia]], where his father Juan de Cervantes was an influential lawyer.

No authenticated portrait of the author is known to exist. The one most often associated with Cervantes is attributed to [[Juan de Jáuregui]], but both names were added at a later date.{{sfn|Byron|1978 |p=131}} The [[El Greco]] painting in the [[Museo del Prado]], known as ''[[Retrato de un caballero desconocido]]'', or ''Portrait of an Unknown Gentleman'', is cited as 'possibly' depicting Cervantes, but there is no evidence for this.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/online-gallery/on-line-gallery/obra/a-nobleman-2/ |title=Portrait of a Gentleman |work=[[Museo del Prado]] |access-date=25 June 2013 |publisher=[[Ministerio de Cultura y Deporte]], [[Gobierno de España]] |language=es}}</ref> The portrait by [[Luis de Madrazo]], at the [[Biblioteca Nacional de España]], was painted in 1859, based on his imagination.<ref>{{cite web |language=es |url=http://www.fnmt.es/index.php?cha=collector&scha=14&page=548&spage=552 |title=Programa Europa – Cervantes |access-date=25 June 2013 |work=[[Fábrica Nacional de Moneda y Timbre]] |year=2013 |publisher=Real Casa de la Moneda |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130629094408/http://www.fnmt.es/index.php?cha=collector&scha=14&page=548&spage=552 |archive-date=29 June 2013}}</ref> The image that appears on [[Spanish euro coins]] of €0.10, €0.20, and €0.50 is based on a bust, created in 1905.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/euro/cash/national/spain_en.htm |title=Euro notes and coins: national sides |work=[[European Commission]] |access-date=25 June 2013 |date=8 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207105016/http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/euro/cash/national/spain_en.htm |archive-date=7 February 2010}}</ref>

===1547 to 1566: Early years===

Rodrigo was frequently in debt, or searching for work, and moved constantly. Leonor came from [[Arganda del Rey]], and died in October 1593, at the age of 73; surviving legal documents indicate she had seven children, could read and write, and was a resourceful individual with an eye for business. When Rodrigo was imprisoned for debt from October 1553 to April 1554, she supported the family on her own.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=34}}

Cervantes's siblings were Andrés (born 1543), Andrea (born 1544), Luisa (born 1546), Rodrigo (born 1550), Magdalena (born 1554) and Juan. They lived in Córdoba until 1556, when his grandfather died. For reasons that are unclear, Rodrigo did not benefit from his will and the family disappears until 1564 when he filed a lawsuit in [[Seville]].{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=36}}

Seville was then in the midst of an economic boom, and Rodrigo managed rented accommodation for his elder brother Andres, who was a junior magistrate. It is assumed Cervantes attended the Jesuit college in Seville, where one of the teachers was Jesuit playwright Pedro Pablo Acevedo, who moved there in 1561 from Córdoba.{{sfn|Egginton|2016|p=23}} However, legal records show his father got into debt once more, and in 1566, the family moved to [[Madrid]].{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=40–41}}

===1566 to 1580: Military service and captivity===
[[File:Madrid - Monumento a Miguel de Cervantes (35231601834).jpg|thumb|left|Monument of Cervantes erected in 1929, [[Madrid]].]]
In the 19th century, a biographer discovered an arrest warrant for a Miguel de Cervantes, dated 15 September 1569, who was charged with wounding Antonio de Sigura in a duel.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=48}} Although disputed at the time, largely on the grounds such behaviour was unworthy of so great an author, it is now accepted as the most likely reason for Cervantes leaving Madrid.{{sfn|Lokos|2016|p=118}}

He eventually made his way to Rome, where he found a position in the household of Giulio Acquaviva, an Italian bishop who spent 1568 to 1569 in Madrid, and was appointed [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]] in 1570.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=50}} When the 1570 to 1573 [[Ottoman–Venetian War (1570–1573)|Ottoman–Venetian War]] began, Spain formed part of the [[Holy League (1571)|Holy League]], a coalition formed to support the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian Republic]]. Possibly seeing an opportunity to have his arrest warrant rescinded, Cervantes went to [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], then part of the [[Crown of Aragon]].{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=52}}
[[File:Nafpaktos evlahos.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Statue of Miguel de Cervantes at the harbour of [[Naupactus]] (Lepanto)]]
The military commander in Naples was Alvaro de Sande, a friend of the family, who gave Cervantes a commission under the [[Álvaro de Bazán, 1st Marquess of Santa Cruz|Marquis de Santa Cruz]]. At some point, he was joined in Naples by his younger brother Rodrigo.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=52}} In September 1571, Cervantes sailed on board the ''Marquesa'', part of the Holy League fleet under Don [[John of Austria]], illegitimate half brother of [[Philip II of Spain|Phillip II of Spain]]; on 7 October, they defeated the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] fleet at the [[Battle of Lepanto]].{{sfn|Davis|1999|p=199}}
[[File:Cervantes en Lepanto.jpg|thumb|upright|Artist's rendition of Cervantes at the battle of Lepanto, by [[Augusto Ferrer-Dalmau]].]]
According to his own account, although suffering from malaria, Cervantes was given command of a 12-man [[skiff]], a small boat used for assaulting enemy galleys. The ''Marquesa'' lost 40 dead, and 120 wounded, including Cervantes, who received three separate wounds, two in the chest, and another that rendered his left arm useless. His actions at Lepanto were a source of pride to the end of his life,{{efn|In the Preface to Volume 2 of ''Don Quixote'', he writes ''the loss of my hand (came about) on the grandest occasion the past or present has seen, or the future can hope to see. If my wounds have no beauty to the beholder's eye, they are, at least, honorable in the estimation of those who know where they were received.''{{sfn|Cervantes|1615|p=20}}}} while Don John approved no less than four separate pay increases for him.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=58}}

In ''[[Viaje del Parnaso|Journey to Parnassus]]'', published two years before his death in 1616, Cervantes claimed to have "lost the movement of the left hand for the glory of the right".{{sfn|Ma|2017|p=99}} As with much else, the extent of his disability is unclear, the only source being Cervantes himself, while commentators cite his habitual tendency to praise himself.{{efn|per Según Nicolás Marín; "No hay ocasión en que Cervantes no se elogie, bien que excusándose por salir de los límites de su natural modestia; tantas veces ocurre esto que no es posible verla nunca ni creer en ella"}} {{sfn|Eisenberg|1996|pp=32–53}} However, they were serious enough to earn him six months in hospital at [[Messina]], Sicily.{{sfn|Fitzmaurice-Kelly|1892|p=33}}

Although he returned to service in July 1572, records show his chest wounds were still not completely healed in February 1573.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=60}} Based mainly in Naples, he joined expeditions to [[Corfu]] and [[Pylos|Navarino]], and took part in the 1573 occupation of [[Tunis]] and [[La Goulette]], which were [[Conquest of Tunis (1574)|recaptured]] by the Ottomans in 1574.{{sfn|Garcés|2002|pp=191–192, 220}} Despite Lepanto, the war overall was an Ottoman victory, and the loss of Tunis a military disaster for Spain. Cervantes returned to [[Palermo]], where he was paid off by the [[Duke of Sessa]], who gave him letters of commendation.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=63}}

In early September 1575, Cervantes and Rodrigo left Naples on the [[galley]] ''Sol''; as they approached [[Barcelona]] on 26 September, their ship was captured by [[Ottoman corsairs]], and the brothers taken to [[Algiers]], to be sold as [[Slavery in the Ottoman Empire|slaves]], or – as was the case of Cervantes and his brother – held for ransom, if this would be more lucrative than their sale as slaves.{{sfn|Fitzmaurice-Kelly|1892|p=41}} Rodrigo was ransomed in 1577, but his family could not afford the fee for Cervantes, who was forced to remain.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=65–68, 78}} Turkish historian Rasih Nuri İleri found evidence suggesting Cervantes worked on the construction of the [[Kılıç Ali Pasha Complex]], which means he spent at least part of his captivity in [[Istanbul]].<ref name="dergi">{{Citation| last= Eren| first= Güleren| title= The Heritage of A Sailor| magazine= Beyoğlu|issue=3|pages=59–64| date=June 2006}}</ref><ref name="kitap">{{cite book|last = Bayrak|first = M.

By 1580, Spain was occupied with integrating [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]], and suppressing the [[Dutch Revolt]], while the Ottomans were at [[Ottoman–Safavid War (1578–1590)|war with Persia]]; the two sides agreed a truce, leading to an improvement of relations.{{sfn|Glete|2001|p=84}} After almost five years, and four escape attempts, in 1580 Cervantes was set free by the [[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarians]], a religious charity that specialised in ransoming [[Barbary slave trade|Christian captives]], and returned to Madrid.{{sfn|Parker|Parker|2009|p=?}}

===1580 to 1616: Later life and death===
[[File:Miguel de Cervantes at the National Library.jpg|thumb|left|"The pen is the language of the soul; as the concepts that in it are generated, such will be its writings."{{spaced ndash}} Statue of Cervantes, outside the [[Biblioteca Nacional de España]] (National Library of Spain).]]
While Cervantes was in captivity, both Don John and the Duke of Sessa died, depriving him of two potential patrons, while the Spanish economy was in dire straits. This made finding employment difficult; other than a period in 1581 to 1582, when he was employed as an intelligence agent in North Africa, little is known of his movements prior to 1584.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=100–101}}

In April of that year, Cervantes visited [[Esquivias]], to help arrange the affairs of his recently deceased friend and minor poet, Pedro Lainez. Here he met Catalina de Salazar y Palacios ({{circa|1566 – 1626}}), eldest daughter of the widowed Catalina de Palacios; her husband died leaving only debts, but the elder Catalina owned some land of her own. This may be why in December 1584, Cervantes married her daughter, then between 15 and 18 years old.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=115–116}} The first use of the name ''Cervantes Saavedra'' appears in 1586, on documents related to his marriage.{{sfn|Garcés|2002|p=189}}

Shortly before this, his illegitimate daughter Isabel was born in November. Her mother, Ana Franca, was the wife of a Madrid inn keeper; they apparently concealed it from her husband, but Cervantes acknowledged paternity.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=113}} When Ana Franca died in 1598, he asked his sister Magdalena to take care of her.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=206}}
[[File:Trinitmad.jpg|thumb|upright|Cervantes was buried at the [[Convento de las Monjas Trinitarias Descalzas|Convent of the Barefoot Trinitarians]] in Madrid.]]
In 1587, Cervantes was appointed as a government purchasing agent, then became a tax collector in 1592. They were also subject to price fluctuations, which could go either way; he was briefly jailed several times for 'irregularities', but quickly released. Several applications for positions in [[New Spain|Spanish America]] were rejected, although modern critics note images of the colonies appear in his work.{{sfn|Ma|2017|p=99}}

From 1596 to 1600, he lived primarily in Seville, then returned to Madrid in 1606, where he remained for the rest of his life.{{sfn|Close|2008|p=12}} In later years, he received some financial support from the [[Pedro Fernández de Castro y Andrade|Count of Lemos]], although he was excluded from the retinue Lemos took to Naples when appointed [[List of viceroys of Naples|Viceroy]] in 1608.{{sfn|Ma|2017|p=99}} In July 1613, he joined the [[Secular Franciscan Order|Third Order Franciscans]], then a common way for Catholics to gain spiritual merit.{{sfn|Fitzmaurice-Kelly|1892|p=179}} It is generally accepted Cervantes died on 22 April 1616 (NS; the [[Gregorian calendar]] had superseded the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] in 1582 in Spain and some other countries); the symptoms described, including intense thirst, correspond to [[diabetes]], then untreatable.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=264}}

In accordance with his will, Cervantes was buried in the [[Convent of the Barefoot Trinitarians]], in central Madrid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/Ca-Ch/Cervantes-Miguel-de.html |title=Miguel de Cervantes Biography – life, family, children, name, story, death, history, wife, son, book |publisher=Notablebiographies.com |access-date=3 February 2012}}</ref> His remains went missing when moved during rebuilding work at the convent in 1673, and in 2014, historian [[Fernando de Prado]] launched a project to rediscover them.<ref>{{cite web|author=Giles Tremlett in Madrid |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jul/25/cervantes-bones-madrid-convent-search |title=Madrid begins search for bones of Don Quixote author Miguel de Cervantes &#124; Books |work=The Guardian |date=25 July 2011 |access-date=18 March 2014}}</ref>

==Literary career and legacy==
[[File:Don Quijote Illustration by Gustave Dore VII.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Illustration from ''Don Quijote'' by [[Gustave Doré]], with the windmill scene]]
Cervantes claimed to have written over 20 plays, such as ''El trato de Argel'', based on his experiences in captivity. Such works were extremely short-lived, and even [[Lope de Vega]], the best-known playwright of the day, could not live on their proceeds.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=112}} In 1585, he published ''La Galatea'', a conventional [[pastoral]] romance that received little contemporary notice; despite promising to write a sequel, he never did so.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=110–111}}

Aside from these, and some poems, by 1605, Cervantes had not been published for 20 years. In ''Don Quixote'', he challenged a form of literature that had been a favourite for more than a century, explicitly stating his purpose was to undermine 'vain and empty' [[chivalric romance]]s.{{sfn|Close|2008|p=39}} His portrayal of real life, and use of everyday speech in a literary context was considered innovative, and proved instantly popular. First published in January 1605, Don Quixote and Sancho Panza featured in masquerades held to celebrate the birth of [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] on 8 April.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=206}}
[[File:Don Quijote illustrated by Gustav Dore V.jpg|thumb|upright|right|An illustration from ''Don Quijote'', by Gustave Doré]]
He finally achieved a degree of financial security, while its popularity led to demands for a sequel. In the foreword to his 1613 work, ''Novelas ejemplares'', dedicated to his patron, the Count of Lemos, Cervantes promises to produce one, but was pre-empted by an unauthorised version published in 1614, published under the name [[Alonso Fernández de Avellaneda]]. It is possible this delay was deliberate, to ensure support from his publisher and reading public; Cervantes finally produced the second part of ''Don Quixote'' in 1615.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=234–235}}

The two parts of ''Don Quixote'' are different in focus, but similar in their clarity of prose, and realism; the first was more comic, and had greater popular appeal.{{sfn|Mitsuo|Cullen|2006|pp=148–152}} The second part is often considered more sophisticated and complex, with a greater depth of characterisation and philosophical insight.{{sfn|Putnam|1976|p=14}}

In addition to this, he produced a series of works between 1613 and his death in 1616. They include a collection of tales titled ''Exemplary Novels''. This was followed by ''Viaje del Parnaso'', or ''Eight Comedies and Eight New Interludes'', and ''[[Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda]]'', completed just before his death, and published posthumously in January 1617.

He was rediscovered by English writers in the mid-18th century; literary editor [[John Bowle (writer)|John Bowle]] argued Cervantes was as significant as any of the Greek and Roman authors then popular, and published an annotated edition in 1781. Now viewed as a significant work, at the time it proved a failure.{{sfn|Truman|2003|pp=9–31}} However, ''Don Quixote'' has been translated into all major languages, in 700 editions. Mexican author [[Carlos Fuentes]] suggested Cervantes and his contemporary [[William Shakespeare]] form part of a narrative tradition, which includes [[Homer]], [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], [[Daniel Defoe|Defoe]], [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]], [[Honoré de Balzac|Balzac]], and [[James Joyce|Joyce]].{{sfn|Fuentes|1988|p=69–70}}

[[Sigmund Freud]] claimed he learnt Spanish to read Cervantes in the original; he particularly admired ''[[The Dialogue of the Dogs]]'' (''El coloquio de los perros''), from ''Exemplary Tales''. Two dogs, Cipión and Berganza, share their stories; as one talks, the other listens, occasionally making comments. From 1871 to 1881, Freud and his close friend, Eduard Silberstein, wrote letters to each other, using the pennames Cipión and Berganza.{{sfn |Riley |1994|pp=13–14}}

Cervantes influenced the popular musical play of 1965, ''[[Man of La Mancha]]''. The musical the song included "The Impossible Dream", which captured Cervantes' philosophy.

Generally considered a mediocre poet, few of his poems survive; some appear in ''[[La Galatea]]'', while he also wrote ''Dos Canciones à la Armada Invencible''.

His [[sonnets]] are considered his best work, particularly ''Al Túmulo del Rey Felipe en Sevilla'', ''Canto de Calíope'' and ''Epístola a Mateo Vázquez''. ''[[Viaje del Parnaso]]'', or ''Journey to Parnassus'', is his most ambitious verse work, an [[allegory]] that consists largely of reviews of contemporary poets.

He published a number of dramatic works, including ten extant full-length plays:
* ''Trato de Argel''; based on his own experiences, deals with the life of Christian slaves in Algiers;
* ''[[La Numancia]]''; intended as a patriotic work, dramatization of the long and brutal siege of [[Numantia]], by [[Scipio Aemilianus]], completing the transformation of the [[Iberian peninsula]] into the Roman province [[Hispania]], or España.
