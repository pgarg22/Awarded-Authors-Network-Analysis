'''Peter V. Brett''' (born February 8, 1973) is an American fantasy novelist. He is the author of the ''Demon Cycle'', whose first volume was published in the UK by [[Harper Collins|HarperCollins's]] Voyager imprint in 2008 as ''[[The Painted Man]]'' and in the US by [[Del Rey Books]] as ''The Warded Man''.

==Early life==
Peter Brett studied English Literature and Art History at the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|University at Buffalo]], graduating in 1995, after which he spent more than ten years working in the pharmaceutical publication field before writing full-time. He developed an interest in fantasy from an early age.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Career==
Brett wrote his 2008 novel ''[[The Painted Man]]'' (''The Warded Man'' in the US) and much of his second novel on his HP [[iPaq]] 6515 while on the New York City subway.<ref name="telegrapharticle">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/7598842/Commuter-who-wrote-fantasy-novel-on-his-phone-on-verge-of-multi-million-dollar-movie-deal.html| title=Commuter who wrote fantasy novel on his phone on verge of multi-million dollar movie deal|accessdate=2010-04-19 | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Nick | last=Allen | date=April 18, 2010}}</ref>

The novel takes place on a formerly advanced civilization world that has now been reduced to a dark age by the attacks of demons known as Corelings. These are powerful beings with magical abilities and differing elemental natures, and each night they emerge from the planet's core to feed on humans, who must take care to be indoors before dark. Against this backdrop the three main characters Arlen, Leesha, and Rojer, pass into maturity and begin individual quests to bring an end to the terror. The book and its sequels have been translated into twenty three languages, including German, French, Greek, Japanese, Russian, Polish, Czech, Spanish, Portuguese, Indonesian, Chinese, Dutch, Korean, Estonian, Turkish, Italian, Serbian, Bulgarian, Hungarian, Romanian, Brazilian and Danish.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.petervbrett.com/news/|title = Peter V Brett :: News}}</ref>

In ''[[The Desert Spear]]'' two men are claimed by their own followers to be humanity's prophesied Deliverer. One is Arlen Bales, formerly of a small hamlet who, after many hard lessons, has become the Warded Man (so called because he has covered himself in demon-warding runes). Another contender is a desert warrior, a former friend and betrayer of Arlen, who carries a mystical spear (stolen from Arlen) and heads a vast army intent on a holy war against the demons and anyone else who stands in the way.<ref name="blogdesertspearupdateii">{{cite web|url=http://www.petervbrett.com/2009/05/02/desert-spear-update-ii|authorlink = Peter V Brett | title=Author's Blog - Peephole In My Skull: Desert Spear Update, II| date = May 2, 2009 |accessdate=2010-04-25}}</ref>
