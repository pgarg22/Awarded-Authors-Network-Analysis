'''W. David Hancock''' is an [[United States|American]] [[playwright]], best known for his plays ''The Race of the Ark Tattoo'' and ''The Convention of Cartography.'' He is a two-time [[Obie Award|Obie]] winner for his works with the Foundry Theatre. His experimental, nonlinear work is known for blurring boundaries between artifice and reality, often through unconventional theatrical spaces and an object-centric dramaturgy. As the critic Elinor Fuchs writes, in Hancock’s work, “…we encounter mystery and authenticity at another level entirely.”<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Fuchs|first=Elinor|date=1999|title=False Memory Syndrome: The Memory Theater of W.

== Career ==
Hancock’s play ''The Convention of Cartography'' was the premiere production of the Foundry Theatre in 1994. Set in a traveling art museum for a deceased artist named Mike, the play won Hancock his first Obie for Playwriting. Hancock went on to be the most produced playwright at the Foundry Theatre.<ref>{{Cite web|date=1994-09-18|title=The Convention of Cartography|url=http://thefoundrytheatre.org/1994/09/18/the-convention-of-cartography/|access-date=2020-07-28|website=The Foundry Theatre|language=en-US}}</ref> His second Foundry Theatre production, in 1995, was ''Deviant Draft'', about an asylum of criminally insane women performing ''The Tempest''.<ref>{{Cite web|date=1995-07-18|title=Deviant Craft|url=http://thefoundrytheatre.org/1995/07/18/deviant-craft/|access-date=2020-07-28|website=The Foundry Theatre|language=en-US}}</ref> ''Deviant Craft'' was a [[The Village Voice|Village Voice]] Choice three weeks in a row.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Wetzsteon|first=Ross|date=1998|title=Voice Choices|work=The Village Voice|url=http://thefoundrytheatre.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/deviant-craft-village-voice-choices.pdf}}</ref> In 1998, the Foundry produced Hancock’s ''The Race of the Ark Tattoo.'' One of his most acclaimed works, ''The Race of the Ark Tattoo'' takes place inside a working flea market run by Mr. P. Foster, who is selling the artifacts of his deceased foster father, Mr. Homer Phinney. The play won Hancock his second Obie, and subsequently toured nationally and internationally.<ref>{{Cite web|date=1998-06-17|title=The Race of the Ark Tattoo|url=http://thefoundrytheatre.org/1998/06/17/the-race-of-the-ark-tattoo/|access-date=2020-07-28|website=The Foundry Theatre|language=en-US}}</ref>

In 2002, Hancock wrote ''The Incubus Archives,'' presented by the Rude Mechanicals and [[Hyde Park Theatre]] in 2002. Reviewing ''The Incubus Archives,'' the [[The Austin Chronicle|Austin Chronicle]] praised Hancock’s construction of, “…a dreamscape -- in which subjects seem to bubble from the darkness of the subconscious…”<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Faires|first1=Robert|last2=Fri.|last3=Oct. 18|last4=2002|title=The Incubus Archives|url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/arts/2002-10-18/106188/|access-date=2020-07-28|website=www.austinchronicle.com|language=en-US}}</ref> In 2011, Clubbed Thumb presented his play ''Our Lot'', written in collaboration with Kristin Newbom, as part of their annual Summerworks festival.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Our Lot {{!}} clubbed thumb|url=https://www.clubbedthumb.org/the-plays/the-plays-2011/our-lot/|access-date=2020-07-28|website=www.clubbedthumb.org}}</ref>

Hancock’s play ''Master'' was produced by the Foundry Theatre in 2017.

== Critical Reception ==
The critic Elinor Fuchs has described Hancock’s work as a, “theater of objects… a memory theater built as a fire wall against the loss of the past.”<ref name=":0" /> While placing Hancock’s plays in conversation with other postmodern artists such as [[Richard Foreman]] and the [[The Wooster Group|Wooster Group]], she also considers Hancock to be pulling on the tradition of the Renaissance memory theater. His work, in her analysis, has a metaphysical scope created by its simultaneous veneer of authenticity and obvious fictionality.<ref name=":0" /> In discussing his work with the Foundry, Alisa Solomon notes that Hancock’s productions created a, “heightened, exquisite artifice,”<ref>{{Cite book|last=Solomon|first=Alisa|title=A Moment on the Clock of the World|publisher=Haymarket Books|year=2019|isbn=9781642590852|pages=24|chapter=Inventing the World: A Quarter-Century of Foundry Plays}}</ref> in line with the Foundry’s goal to create its own theatrical worlds, rather than mimic the real world.

His work has influenced a wide range of writers, including [[Heidi Schreck]] (''[[What the Constitution Means to Me]]''),<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-09-11|title=Heidi Schreck on What the Constitution Means to Me (meaning her, and maybe you too)|url=http://www.theintervalny.com/interviews/2018/09/heidi-schreck-on-what-the-constitution-means-to-me-meaning-her-and-maybe-you-too/|access-date=2020-07-28|website=The Interval|language=en-US}}</ref> and Peggy Stafford.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Szymkowicz|first=Adam|date=2010-12-09|title=Adam Szymkowicz: I Interview Playwrights Part 292: Peggy Stafford|url=http://aszym.blogspot.com/2010/12/i-interview-playwrights-part-292-peggy.html|access-date=2020-07-28|website=Adam Szymkowicz}}</ref>
