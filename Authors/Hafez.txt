Hafez was born in [[Shiraz]], [[Iran]]. Despite his profound effect on Persian life and culture and his enduring popularity and influence, few details of his life are known.

==Legends==
[[File:Divan, collected works, by Hafez, calligraphy by Enayatollah al-Shirazi, Iran, late 16th century AD, ink, watercolour, gold on paper - Aga Khan Museum - Toronto, Canada - DSC06699.jpg|thumb|Divan, late 16th century]]
[[File:Thr muze art islam 17.jpg|thumb|left|Divan of Hafez, with a [[Persian miniature]] at left and [[ghazal]]s in [[nastaliq]] at right. Signed by Shah Qasem, 1617. [[National Museum of Iran]], [[Tehran]], [[Persia]].]]

Many semi-miraculous mythical tales were woven around Hafez after his death. It is said that by listening to his father's recitations, Hafez had accomplished the task of learning the [[Quran]] by heart at an early age (that is [[Hafiz (Qur'an)|the meaning of the word ''Hafez'']]). At the same time, he is said to have known by heart the works of [[Rumi]] ([[Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Balkhi]]), [[Saadi (poet)|Saadi]], [[Attar Neyshapuri|Farid ud-Din]], and [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]].

According to one tradition, before meeting his self-chosen [[Sufi]] master [[Hajji Zayn al-Attar]], Hafez had been working in a bakery, delivering bread to a wealthy quarter of the town. There, he first saw Shakh-e Nabat, a woman of great beauty, to whom some of his poems are addressed. Ravished by her beauty but knowing that his love for her would [[Unrequited love|not be requited]], he allegedly held his first mystic vigil in his desire to realize this union. Still, he encountered a being of surpassing beauty who identified himself as an [[angel]], and his further attempts at union became mystic; a pursuit of spiritual union with the divine. A Western parallel is that of [[Dante]] and [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]].

At 60, he is said to have begun a ''[[Chilla-nashini]]'', a 40-day-and-night vigil by sitting in a circle that he had drawn for himself. On the 40th day, he once again met with Zayn al-Attar on what is known to be their fortieth anniversary and was offered a cup of [[Shirazi wine|wine]]. It was there where he is said to have attained "Cosmic Consciousness". He hints at this episode in one of his verses in which he advises the reader to attain "clarity of wine" by letting it "sit for 40 days".

In one tale, [[Tamerlane]] (Timur) angrily summoned Hafez to account for one of his verses:
{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
<poem>
'agar 'ān Tork-e Šīrāzī * be dast ārad del-ē mā-rā
be khāl-ē Hendu-yaš baxšam * Samarqand ō Boxārā-rā</poem>

{{col-break}}
<poem>
If that Shirazi Turk accepts my heart in their hand,
for their Indian mole I will give Samarkand and Bukhara.</poem>
{{col-end}}

[[Samarkand]] was Tamerlane's capital and [[Bokhara]] was the kingdom's finest city. "With the blows of my lustrous sword", Timur complained, "I have subjugated most of the habitable globe... to embellish Samarkand and Bokhara, the seats of my government; and you would sell them for the black mole of some girl in Shiraz!"

Hafez, the tale goes, bowed deeply and replied, "Alas, O Prince, it is this prodigality which is the cause of the misery in which you find me". So surprised and pleased was Timur with this response that he dismissed Hafez with handsome gifts.<ref name="Gray"/>

===Intellectual and artistic legacy===
Hafez was acclaimed throughout the [[Islamic world]] during his lifetime, with other [[Lists of Persian poets|Persian poets]] imitating his work, and offers of patronage from [[Baghdad]] to [[India]].<ref name=Gray/>

His work was first translated into English in 1771 by [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]]. It would leave a mark on such Western writers as [[Thoreau]], [[Goethe]], [[W. B. Yeats]], in his prose anthology book of essays, ''Discoveries'',<ref>[https://archive.org/details/discoveriesvolum00yeatrich/mode/2up Discoveries]</ref> as well as gaining a positive reception within West Bengal, in India, among some of the most prolific religious leaders and poets in this province, [[Debendranath Tagore]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]]'s father, who knew  [[Persian language|Persian]] and used to recite from Hafez's Divans and in this line, Gurudev himself, who, during his visit to Persia in 1932, also made a homage visit to Hafez's tomb in [[Shiraz]]<ref>[https://archive.org/details/autobiographyofm00thakuoft/mode/2up The autobiography of Maharshi Devendranath Tagore]</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/details/RABINDRANATHTAGORE_201807/mode/2up?

There is no definitive version of his collected works (or ''Dīvān''); editions vary from 573 to 994 poems. Only since the 1940s has a sustained scholarly attempt (by [[Mas'ud Farzad]], [[Qasim Ghani]] and others in [[Iran]]) been made to authenticate his work and to remove errors introduced by later [[copyist]]s and censors. However, the reliability of such work has been questioned,<ref>Michael Hillmann in ''Rahnema-ye Ketab'', 13 (1971), "Kusheshha-ye Jadid dar Shenakht-e Divan-e Sahih-e Hafez"</ref> and in the words of Hāfez scholar [[Iraj Bashiri]], "there remains little hope from there (i.e.: Iran) for an authenticated diwan".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.angelfire.com/rnb/bashiri/Hafiz/Hafiz.html |title=Hafiz' Shirazi Turk: A Structuralist's Point of View |access-date=2013-08-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301031207/http://www.angelfire.com/rnb/bashiri/Hafiz/Hafiz.html |archive-date=2014-03-01 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Many Iranians use Divan of Hafez for [[Bibliomancy|fortune telling]].<ref>[[Massoud Khalili#September 9, 2001]] Massoud Khalili speaking to BBC correspondent Lyse Doucet</ref> Iranian families usually have a Divan of Hafez in their house, and when they get together during the [[Nowruz]] or [[Yaldā]] holidays, they open the Divan to a random page and read the poem on it, which they believe to be an indication of things that will happen in the future.<ref>[[:fa:حافظ]]</ref>

===In Iranian music===
Many [[List of Iranian composers|Iranian composers]] have composed [[Musical composition|pieces]] inspired by or based upon Hafez's poems. Among Iranian singers, [[Mohsen Namjoo]] composed music and vocals on several poems such as ''Zolf'', ''Del Miravad'', ''Nameh'', and others. [[Hayedeh]] performed the song "Padeshah-e Khooban", with music by [[Farid Zoland]].  [[Mohammad-Reza Shajarian]] performed the song "Del Miravad Ze Dastam", with music by [[Parviz Meshkatian]]. The Ottoman composer [[Buhurizade Mustafa Itri]] composed his magnum opus Neva Kâr based upon one of Hafez's poems. The Polish composer [[Karol Szymanowski]] composed [[The Love Songs of Hafiz]] based upon a German translation of Hafez poems.

===In Afghan music===
Many Afghan singers, including [[Ahmad Zahir]] and [[Sarban (singer)|Sarban]], have composed songs such as "Ay Padeshah-e Khooban", "Gar-Zulfe Parayshanat".{{citation needed|date=September 2020}}

==Interpretation==
[[File:Hafez statute at Tehran's Hafez street.jpg|thumb|upright|Hafez's statue in a street with his name in [[Tehran]]]]
The question of whether his work is to be interpreted literally, mystically, or both has been a source of contention among western scholars.<ref>Schroeder, Eric, "The Wild Deer Mathnavi" in ''The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'', Vol. 11, No. 2, Special Issue on Oriental Art and Aesthetics (December 1952), p.118</ref> On the one hand, some of his early readers such as [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]] saw in him a conventional lyricist similar to European love poets such as [[Petrarch]].<ref>[[William Jones (philologist)|Jones, William]] (1772) "Preface" in ''Poems, Consisting Chiefly of Translations from the Asiatick Tongues'' p. iv</ref> Others scholars such as [[Henry Wilberforce Clarke]] saw him as purely a poet of didactic, ecstatic [[mysticism]] in the manner of [[Rumi]], a view that a minority of twentieth century critics and literary historians have come to challenge.<ref>Dick Davis: Hafez Faces of Love and the Poets of Shiraz, introduction</ref> [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] rejected the Sufistic view of wine in Hafez's poems.<ref>{{cite web |title=EMERSON, RALPH WALDO – Encyclopaedia Iranica |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/emerson |website=www.iranicaonline.org |access-date=26 April 2020}}</ref>

This confusion stems from the fact that, early in Persian literary history, the poetic vocabulary was usurped by mystics, who believed that the ineffable could be better approached in poetry than in prose. In composing poems of mystic content, they imbued every word and image with mystical undertones, causing mysticism and lyricism to converge into a single tradition. As a result, no fourteenth-century Persian poet could write a [[Lyric poetry|lyrical poem]] without having a flavor of mysticism forced on it by the poetic vocabulary itself.<ref>Thackston, Wheeler: ''A Millennium of Classical Persian Poetry'', Ibex Publishers Inc. 1994, p.&nbsp;ix in "Introduction"</ref><ref>Davis, Dick, "On Not Translating Hafez" in the ''[[New England Review]]'' 25:1-2 [2004]: 310-18</ref> While some poets, such as [[Ubayd Zakani]], attempted to distance themselves from this fused mystical-lyrical tradition by writing [[satire]]s, Hafez embraced the fusion and thrived on it. [[Wheeler Thackston]] has said of this that Hafez "sang a rare blend of human and mystic love so balanced... that it is impossible to separate one from the other".<ref>[[Wheeler Thackston|Thackston, Wheeler]], ''A Millennium of Classical Persian Poetry'', Ibex Publishers Inc.' 1994, p.64</ref>

For reasons such as that, the history of the translation of Hāfez is fraught with complications, and few translations into western languages have been wholly successful.

One of the figurative gestures for which he is most famous (and which is among the most difficult to translate) is ''[[īhām]]'' or artful [[pun]]ning. Thus, a word such as ''gowhar'', which could mean both "essence, truth" and "pearl", would take on ''both'' meanings at once as in a phrase such as "a pearl/essential truth outside the shell of superficial existence".

Hafez often took advantage of the aforementioned lack of distinction between lyrical, mystical, and [[panegyric]] writing by using highly intellectualized, elaborate [[metaphor]]s and images to suggest multiple possible meanings. For example, a [[couplet]] from one of Hafez's poems reads:{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}<!--whose translation? Source?-->
{{poemquote|Last night, from the cypress branch, the nightingale sang,
In Old Persian tones, the lesson of spiritual stations.}}

The [[cypress]] tree is a symbol both of the beloved and of a regal presence; the [[Common nightingale|nightingale]] and birdsong evoke the traditional setting for human love. The "lessons of spiritual stations" suggest, obviously, a mystical undertone as well (though the word for "spiritual" could also be translated as "intrinsically meaningful"). Therefore, the words could signify at once a prince addressing his devoted followers, a lover courting a beloved, and the reception of spiritual wisdom.<ref name=":1">Meisami, Julie Scott.

== Satire, religion, and politics  ==
[[File:Hafis-Goethe-Denkmal in Weimar.jpg|thumb|Hafez-Goethe monument in [[Weimar]], Germany]]
Though Hafez is well known for his poetry, he is less commonly recognized for his intellectual and political contributions.<ref>[http://www.hawzah.net/fa/magazine/magart/3282/4773/39121# Hafez, singing love Mahmood Soree, Golbarg magazine, mehr 1382, number 43]</ref> A defining feature of Hafez' poetry is its [[irony|ironic tone]] and the theme of hypocrisy, widely believed to be a critique of the religious and ruling establishments of the time.<ref name="views">{{cite book |last1=Yavari |first1=Neguin |last2=Potter |first2=Lawrence G. |last3=Oppenheim |first3=Jean-Marc Ran |title=Views from the Edge: Essays in Honor of Richard W.

In this period, Hafez and other notable early satirists, such as [[Ubayd Zakani]], produced a body of work that has since become a template for the use of satire as a political device. Many of his critiques are believed to be targeted at the rule of [[Mubariz al-Din Muhammad]], specifically, towards the disintegration of important public and private institutions.<ref name="views"/><ref name="aftabir"/><ref name="tebyan1">{{cite web|url=http://adab.tebyan.net/newindex.aspx?pid=4202&Keyword=طنز+حافظ|title=مائده جان رسید ( بخش سوم)}}</ref>

His work, particularly his imaginative references to [[monasteries]], [[convents]], Shahneh, and [[muhtasib]], ignored the religious [[taboo]]s of his period, and he found humor in some of his society's religious doctrines.<ref name="aftabir"/><ref name="tebyan1"/> Employing humor polemically has since become a common practice in Iranian public discourse and satire is now perhaps the [[de facto]] language of Iranian social commentary.<ref name="aftabir"/>

== Divan-e-Hafez ==
[[The Divān of Hafez|Divan Hafez]] is a book containing all the remaining poems of Hafez. Most of these poems are in Persian and the most crucial part of this Divan is [[Ghazal|ghazals]]. There are poems in other poetic formats such as piece, ode, [[Masnavi]] and [[quatrain]] in this Divan.

There is no evidence that most of Hafez's poems were destroyed. In addition, Hafez was very famous during his lifetime; Therefore, the small number of poetry in the court indicates that he was not a prolific poet.

Hafez's Divan was probably compiled for the first time by Mohammad Glendam after his death. Of course, some unconfirmed reports indicate that Hafez published his court in 770 AH. that is, edited more than twenty years before his death.<ref name=":1" />

== Death and the tomb ==
The year of Hafez's death is 791 AH. Hafez was buried in the prayer hall of Shiraz called [[Tomb of Hafez|hafezieh]]. In 855 AH, after the conquest of Shiraz by Abolghasem Babar Teymouri, they built a tomb under the command of his minister, Maulana Mohammad Mamaei.<ref name=":0" />
