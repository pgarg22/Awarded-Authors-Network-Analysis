==Biography==

===Personal life===
Her father was Edwin Dennis Howard, a soldier in the U.S. Army, stationed in Germany, where she was born. The family moved about a great deal when she was young. Her father always dreamed of retiring to Hawaii and after he died in 1964, Lindsey and her mother settled there to honor him.<ref name="ib">{{cite web|url=http://www.iblist.com/author870.htm|title=Author Information: Johanna Lindsey|work=iblist.com|accessdate=2007-06-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930210038/http://www.iblist.com/author870.htm|archive-date=2007-09-30|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1970, when she was still in school, she married Ralph Bruce Lindsey, becoming a young housewife. The marriage continued, the couple residing in Hawaii and producing three children; Alfred, Joseph and Garret, who already have made her a grandmother. After her husband's death, Lindsey moved to Maine and did not remarry. She died on October 27, 2019 at the age of 67 from lung cancer.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/22/obituaries/johanna-lindsey-dead.html|title=Johanna Lindsey, Best-Selling Romance Novelist, Dies at 67|work=The New York Times|date=22 Dec 2019}}</ref>

===Writing career===
Lindsey wrote her first book, ''Captive Bride'', in 1977 "on a whim".<ref name="ib"/> The book was a success, as have been the forty-nine novels that followed. As of 2006 more than fifty-eight million copies of her books have been sold worldwide, and her work has been translated into twelve languages.

==Style and reception==
{{More citations needed section|date=December 2019}}

Owing to their diversity of settings Lindsey's work covers a number of romance subgenres, including medieval, [[Regency romance|Regency]], western, Viking, and even science fiction. Her most popular books are a series of Regency sagas about the fictional Malory family ([[:Image:Malory Family Tree Johanna Lindsey.png|see Family Tree]]).


The covers of Lindsey's novels have been parodied,<ref>http://smartbitchestrashybooks.com/2007/08/cover_makeovers/</ref> fitting in as they do with a trend in romance publishing to use gaudy painted designs that feature a muscular male model (i.e. [[Fabio Lanzoni|Fabio]]) with his chest exposed, towering above or otherwise dominating floridly dressed women.
