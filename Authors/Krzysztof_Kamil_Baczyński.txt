Baczyński was born in [[Warsaw]] into the family of renowned literary critic and soldier of the [[Polish Legions in World War I]], [[Stanislaw Baczynski|Stanisław Baczyński]] and school teacher Stefania Zieleńczyk. His mother was a zealous [[Catholicism|Catholic]] but with [[Jew]]ish roots, and as such was treated by the Germans as Jewish. His uncle, Dr. Adam Zieleńczyk, escaped from the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] and was killed by Germans in 1943.<ref>Magdalena Grochowska [http://polish-jewish-heritage.org/Pol/Aug_04_Wezwani-GWgdalena_Grochowska.htm Wezwani by umrzeć], ''[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]'', 6 August 2004</ref>

Baczynski was baptized on 7 September 1922 in Warsaw. As a child, he suffered from asthma, his heart was very weak and he was in constant threat of [[tuberculosis]]. In 1933, he began education at [[Gimnazjum i Liceum im. Stefana Batorego (Warsaw, Poland)|Gimnazjum i Liceum im. Stefana Batorego]], he graduated in May 1939. In his class there were future heroes of the [[Szare Szeregi]] - [[Jan Bytnar]] (''Rudy'') and [[Tadeusz Zawadzki]] (''Zośka''). Baczynski debuted as a poet some time in 1938 in ''Strzała'' - a magazine published by the Organization of [[Socialism|Socialist]] Youth ''Spartakus'', to which he belonged himself. After graduation, he wished to continue his education at Warsaw's Academy of Fine Arts, but the outbreak of [[World War II]] ended these plans.

During the German and Soviet (until 1941) occupation of Poland, he continued to work with the left-wing underground press, most notably with the "Płomienie" (''Flames'') and "Droga" (''Way'') magazines. At the same time he was a student of [[Polish language]] at the secret underground [[Warsaw University]] and the [[Armia Krajowa]]'s "[[Agricola (school)|Agricola]]" [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]] School. He took up several jobs, and in 1943 joined [[Batalion Zośka]], after which he gave up studies, committing himself to the Polish resistance activities. In his apartment, he hid several pieces of weaponry, including [[submachine gun]]s and grenades.

On 6 July 1942 he married [[Barbara Drapczyńska]], a university colleague. The marriage resulted in a set of erotica written by Baczyński, reputedly one of the most notable in the Polish language. Shortly before the [[Warsaw Uprising]] Baczyński gave a copy of all his poems to one of his friends, to hide in [[Żoliborz]]. Because of that, they survived the war.

As a member of [[Scouting]] Assault Groups (''[[Związek Harcerstwa Polskiego|Harcerskie]] Grupy Szturmowe''), Baczyński took part in many sabotage actions throughout the occupation. One of them was derailment of a German military train in August 1944, which resulted in a 26-hour delay of traffic on the strategic connection Warsaw-[[Białystok]].

After the [[Warsaw Uprising]] broke out, he joined the "[[Batalion Parasol|Parasol]]" battalion. He was [[killed in action]] by a German [[sniper]] at approximately 4pm on 4 August 1944 in the Blanka Palace in the [[Warsaw Old Town]]. He is buried in the [[Powązki Military Cemetery]], together with his pregnant wife, who was killed on 1 September 1944. He was [[posthumous award|posthumously]] awarded the [[Armia Krajowa Cross]] and in 1947 the [[Medal for Warsaw 1939-1945]] ([[:pl:Medal za Warszawę 1939–1945|pl]]).

In his poems and short novels, Baczyński demonstrated both [[romanticism|romantic]] traditions and [[catastrophism|catastrophism.]] His poems depict the brutality of war, and suggest that love is the only force that can effectively defend a human being against it. His talent was highly appreciated by his contemporaries, [[Stanisław Pigon]], upon hearing news of Baczynski joining the Szare Szeregi, said to [[Kazimierz Wyka]]: ''We belong to a nation, whose fate is to shoot at the enemy with diamonds''.
