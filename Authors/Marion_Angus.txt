'''Marion Emily Angus''' (1865–1946) was a Scottish poet who wrote in the [[Scots language|Scots vernacular]] or Braid Scots, defined by some as a dialect of English and others as a closely related language. Her prose writings are mainly in standard English. She is seen as a forerunner of a [[Scottish renaissance]] in inter-war poetry – her verse marks a departure from the [[Lallans]] tradition of [[Robert Burns]] towards that of [[Hugh MacDiarmid]], [[Violet Jacob]] and others.<ref name="ODNB">ODNB entry: [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/59069 Retrieved 8 December 2011.

==Life==
Born on 27 March 1865 in [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]], England, Marion Angus was the third of the six children of Mary Jessie, née Watson, and Henry Angus (1833–1902), a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] minister from North-East Scotland. Her grandfather on her mother's side was William Watson, sheriff-substitute of Aberdeen from 1829 to 1866, who in 1841 founded there the first [[industrial school]] for street children. Her father graduated from [[Marischal College]] in the same city and was ordained in Sunderland in 1859. He became minister of Erskine United Free Church, [[Arbroath]], in 1876. He retired from the ministry in 1900.<ref name="ODNB"/>

The Angus family left Sunderland for Arbroath in February 1876, when Marion was almost eleven.<ref>Introduction to ''The Singin Lass. Selected Works...'', p. 13.</ref> She was educated at [[Arbroath High School]],<ref>The Wee Web: [https://web.archive.org/web/20120315052127/http://www.theweeweb.co.uk/public/author_profile.php?id=1529 Retrieved 9 December 2011.]</ref> but did not follow her brothers into higher education.<ref>Introduction to ''The Singin Lass. Selected Works...'', p. 16.</ref> However, she may well have been to France, as she spoke the language fluently and made several references to France in her prose writings.<ref>Introduction to ''The Singin Lass. Selected Works...'', p. 19.</ref> She also visited Switzerland and left an account of it.<ref>''Round about Geneva'', 1899.</ref>

Marion wrote fictionalized diaries anonymously for a newspaper, the ''Arbroath Guide''. Entitled ''The Diary of Arthur Ogilvie'' (1897–1898) and ''Christabel's Diary'' (1899), they were also published in book form, but no copies of the former have survived. These have been taken to shed indirect light on Angus's life in early adulthood, which included abundant family and church work, and exercise in the form of walking and cycling.<ref>Introduction to ''The Singin Lass. Selected Works...'', pp. 18–21 and 44; doctoral dissertation by Aimée Y. Chalmers, p. 2. [http://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/bitstream/10023/1846/7/AYChalmersPhDThesisPart1.pdf Retrieved 9 December 2011.]</ref>

After the death of their father, Marion and her sister Emily ran a private school at their mother's house in [[Cults, Aberdeenshire|Cults]], outside Aberdeen, but this was given up after the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]], during which Marion worked in an army canteen. She and her sister returned to Aberdeen in 1921. However, Emily became mentally ill in April 1930 and was admitted to the Glasgow Royal Asylum, [[Gartnavel Royal Hospital|Gartnavel]]. Marion moved to various places around [[Glasgow]] to be near the institution where her sister was. She continued to publish poetry and gave occasional lectures, but her finances deteriorated and she became subject to [[Depression (mood)|depression]].<ref>Introduction to ''The Singin Lass. Selected Works...'', pp. 32–34.</ref> A fellow Scots poet, [[Nan Shepherd]], became a close friend in this period.

The only surviving body of Marion Angus's correspondence consists of letters to Marie Campbell Ireland, a friend she made in about 1930. A selection of these has been published.<ref>Introduction to ''The Singin Lass. Selected Works...'', pp. 113–123.</ref> They and other letters betray a vein of disrespect and impatience with conventional society: "I don't know," she wrote to Ireland in about 1930, "that I care particularly for what is usually called 'cultivated people'. I found a more delicate and refined sympathy in my charwoman in Aberdeen than I did in any of my educated acquaintance."<ref>Papers of Mairi Campbell Ireland, National Library of Scotland, MS 19328 folio 71. Quoted in ''Voices from their Ain Countrie...'', p. 4.</ref> The unconventional side of her is recalled in an article by a friend that appeared after her death: "She was nothing if not original.... Even when her wit was mordant, she had a capacious and most generous heart."<ref>P. W. L.: Miss Marion Angus: An Appreciation. ''Arbroath Guide'', 31 August 1946, p. 6. Quoted in ''Voices from their Ain Countrie...'', p. 5.</ref>

Marion Angus returned to Arbroath in 1945 to be looked after by an erstwhile family servant, Williamina Sturrock Matthews. She died there on 18 August 1946.<ref name="ODNB"/> Her ashes were scattered on the sands of Elliot Links.<ref>Scottish Poetry Library site.

==Poetry==
The first important published work by Marion Angus was a biography of her grandfather: ''Sheriff Watson of Aberdeen: the Story of his Life and his Work for the Young'' (1913). She did not begin to write poetry until after 1918. Her first volume, written in Scots, was ''The Lilt'', which came out about the same time as MacDiarmid's first experiments in the ''[[Dunfermline Press]]''. The first stanza of the title poem establishes Angus's "voice" as a poet.

<poem>{{lang|sco|Jean Gordon is weaving a' her lane
Twinin the threid wi a thocht o her ain,
Hearin the tune o the bairns at play
That they're singin among them ilka day;
And saftly, saftly ower the hill
Comes the sma, sma rain.}}</poem>

Five other volumes of verse followed: ''The Tinker's Road and other Verses'' (1924), ''Sun and Candlelight'' (1927), ''The Singin' Lass'' (1929), ''The Turn of Day'' (1931), and ''Lost Country and other Verses'' (1937). Her work was influenced by the [[Border ballad|Scottish ballad]] tradition and by early Scots poets such as [[Robert Henryson]] and [[William Dunbar]], rather than by Burns. She associated in the pre-war [[Scottish Renaissance]] initially with revivalists like [[Violet Jacob]], [[Alexander Gray (poet)|Alexander Gray]] and [[Lewis Spence]],<ref>Scottish renaissance (2000). In ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English''. Retrieved from [http://www.credoreference.com/entry/cupliteng/scottish_renaissance 17 December 2011.]</ref> and then with MacDiarmid and his cultural efforts in the 1920s and 1930s, through inclusion of her work in ''Scottish Chapbook'' and ''Northern Numbers''. She also did radio work at that time.<ref name="ODNB"/>

MacDiarmid voiced qualified approval of Angus's poetry in polemics for the ''[[Association for Scottish Literary Studies|Scottish Literary Journal]]'' in 1925 and 1926. Angus herself spoke of her ambitions and limitations as a poet in an address in the 1920s to the [[Scottish Association for the Speaking of Verse]]: "I would fain give voice to Scotland's great adventure of the soul."<ref>Association of Scottish Literary Studies: [http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/scotlit/asls/Spirit_of_Place.html Retrieved 8 December 2011.]</ref> However, [[Helen Cruickshank]] notes in a memoir that Angus did not think highly of MacDiarmid as a poet or approve of his experiments in [[Lallans#Synthetic Scots|Synthetic Scots]]. Nonetheless, they moved in the same direction, going back beyond Burns to earlier, mainly Eastern Scots ballad and folk-song traditions. As Cruikshank put it, "She was steeped in the knowledge and lore of the Ballads, until they seemed part of her life. Lost love, unquiet spirits, barley-breid and elder-wine: they are the very stuff of the Ballads."<ref>Scottish Poetry Library site.</ref>

The scholar Katherine Gordon saw steady development in her work through the 1920s and 1930s: "The understated lyricism of ''The Lilt and Other Verses'' becomes, by the late 1920s, distinctly stronger and more emotionally potent in ''Sun and Candlelight'' and ''The Singin' Lass''."<ref>''Voices from their Ain Countrie...'', p. 9.</ref> Her interest in the supernatural in literature emerged early: "One poem which, when I was a child, made my flesh creep and filled me with a tearful pity" was 'The Brownie of Blednoch' by [[William Nicholson (poet)|William Nicholson]] (1782–1849).<ref>Marion Angus: Scottish Poetry Old and New. In: ''The Scottish Association for the Speaking of Verse...'' (Edinburgh: Constable, 1928), pp. 18–29. Quoted in ''Voices from their Ain Countrie...'', p. 6. See [http://literaryballadarchive.com/PDF/Nicholson_1_Brownie.pdf Retrieved 16 April 2012.]</ref>

As Colin Milton wrote, "Marion Angus is a poet of the social and psychological margins: her poems hint and suggest rather than state, often conveying repressed or unreturned feelings and liminal states." Her exploration of the experience of women contrasts with "the mainly male-dominated poetry of the 'Renaissance' movement."<ref name="ODNB"/> Typical of the telling simplicity of her earlier work is this stanza from "Mary's Sang", which appeared in ''The Tinker's Road'':

<poem>''My beloved sall ha'e this he'rt tae break,
''Reid, reid wine and the barley cake;
''A he'rt tae break, an' a mou' tae kiss,
''Tho' he be nae mine, as I am his.''</poem>

==Posthumous interest==
Angus's ''Selected Poems'' edited by [[Maurice Lindsay]] with a memoir by Helen Cruickshank appeared in 1950. Two more selections ensued in 2006. The editor of one, Aimée Chalmers, described in Braid Scots her discovery of Marion Angus: "A wee bookie poems bi Marion Angus (1865–1946) fell frae a library shelf, as if bi magic glamourie, at my feet. Her Scots tung heezed up ma hert. Her weirdfu, ghaistly verse, an her sparkie wit on the natur o time dirled ma heid. 'A thoosand years o clood and flame/An a' thing's the same and aye the same.' Whaun I read what some tattie scone had said aboot her: 'no life could be less conspicuous', I was scunnert. I did some delvin for masell, then wrote doon the richt wey o daen (the start o a selection o her work). That wasnae eneuch: I kent hoo she thocht aboot things frae whit she wrote and wantit mair o her spirit tae come though. Sae I traivelled her 'Tinker's Road' wi her, for some five years. Gey chancie, spookie things happened (whiles gied me the cauld creeps), but in the end I 'won ower the tap'."<ref>26 Treasures [http://26treasures.tumblr.com/post/7114482285/lizziaes-post-by-aimee-chalmers Retrieved 9 December 2011.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426041854/http://26treasures.tumblr.com/post/7114482285/lizziaes-post-by-aimee-chalmers

Commenting on the sparseness of the information about Angus's life, Chalmers warns against extrapolating it from her poetry: "The pity is that rather than recognising her skill at transforming the particular into the universal, critics have sometimes allowed conjecture about her private life to stereotype and define the poet, thereby influencing their evaluation of her work."<ref>Quoted on the Scottish Poetry Library site.</ref>

Verse by Marion Angus has appeared in many anthologies, including ''Living Scottish Poets'' (Benn, [1931]), ''Oor Mither Tongue: An Anthology of Scots Vernacular Verse'' (Paisley: Alexander Gardner, 1937), ''Poets' Quair: An Anthology for Scottish Schools'' (Edinburgh: Oliver & Boyd, 1950), and more recently ''The [[Faber and Faber|Faber]] Book of Twentieth-Century Scottish Poetry'' (London, 1992), ''The Poetry of Scotland, Gaelic, Scots and English'' (Edinburgh, 1995), and ''Modern Scottish Women Poets'' (Edinburgh, 2003). Her most frequently anthologized poem is about [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], "Alas, Poor Queen", written partly in standard English.<ref>Tudor History site: [http://tudorhistory.org/poetry/alas.html Retrieved 8 December 2011.]</ref>
