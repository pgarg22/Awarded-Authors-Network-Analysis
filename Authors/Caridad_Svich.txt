This volume seeks to recontextualize Lorca's experimental work for a new audience now that 100 years have passed since the poet's birth, and allows directors, actors, and academics to rediscover the lesser-known plays of Lorca's commedia-influenced period as well as reaquaint themselves with his little-performed classic As Five Years Pass"--P.
