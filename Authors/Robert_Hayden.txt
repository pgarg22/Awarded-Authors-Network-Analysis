'''Robert Hayden''' (August 4, 1913{{sndash}}February 25, 1980) was an American [[poet]], [[essayist]], and [[educator]]. He served as [[Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress]] from 1976 to 1978, a role today known as US Poet Laureate.<ref>{{cite web | title=Poet Laureate Timeline: 1971-1980 | url=https://www.loc.gov/poetry/laureate-1971-1980.html | publisher=Library of Congress | year=2008 | access-date=December 19, 2008}}</ref> He was the first African-American writer to hold the office.

==Biography==
Robert Hayden was born Asa Bundy Sheffey in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], to Ruth and Asa Sheffey, who separated before his birth. He was taken in by a foster family next door, Sue Ellen Westerfield and William Hayden, and grew up in a Detroit ghetto nicknamed "[[Black Bottom, Detroit|Paradise Valley]]".<ref name=norton>{{cite book | last1=Ramazani | first1=Jahan | last2=Ellmann | first2=Richard | last3=O'Clair | first3=Robert | title=The Norton Anthology of Modern and Contemporary Poetry | edition=Third | volume=vol.2 | isbn=0-393-97792-7 |location=New York | publisher=W.W. Norton | year=2003}}</ref> The Haydens' perpetually contentious marriage, coupled with Ruth Sheffey's competition for her son's affections, made for a traumatic childhood. Witnessing fights and suffering beatings, Hayden lived in a house fraught with "chronic anger", the effects of which would stay with him throughout his life. On top of that, his severe visual problems prevented him from participating in activities such as sports in which nearly everyone else was involved. His childhood traumas resulted in debilitating bouts of [[Clinical depression|depression]] that he later called "my dark nights of the soul".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://brownvboard.org/content/my-dark-nights-soul-poet-robert-hayden|title=My Dark Nights of Soul - Poet Robert Hayden {{!}} Brown Foundation|website=brownvboard.org|access-date=August 4, 2019}}</ref>

Because he was [[nearsighted]] and slight of stature, he was often ostracized by his peers. In response, Hayden read voraciously, developing both an ear and an eye for transformative qualities in literature. He attended [[Detroit City College]] later called Wayne State University with a major in Spanish and minor in English, and left in 1936 during the [[Great Depression]], one credit short of finishing his degree, to go to work for the Works Progress Administration [[Federal Writers' Project]], where he researched black history and folk culture.<ref name=Buck04>{{cite book | last=Buck | first=Christopher  | chapter=Chapter 4: Robert Hayden | title=Oxford Encyclopedia of American Literature | volume=vol. 2 | pages=177–181 | location=New York | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2004 | isbn=0-19-516725-2 | chapter-url=http://bahai-library.com/buck_robert_hayden}}</ref>

Leaving the Federal Writers' Project in 1938, Hayden married Erma Morris in 1940<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/104280772/erma-inez-hayden|title=Erma Hayden memorial|website=[[Find a Grave]]}}</ref> and published his first volume, ''Heart-Shape in the Dust'' (1940). He enrolled at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1941 and won a [[Hopwood Award]] there. Raised as a [[Baptist]], he followed his wife into the [[Baháʼí Faith]] during the early 1940s,<ref name=Buck04/><ref name=Ebony78>{{cite news|author = Harriet Jackson Scarupa|title =Robert Hayden 'Poet Laureate'| magazine = Ebony|issn = 0012-9011|volume = 33|issue = 3|pages =78–80, 82|date =January 1978|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=1LeBkQ_NQNEC&pg=PA78| access-date = December 24, 2014}}</ref> and raised a daughter, Maia, in the religion. Hayden became one of the best-known Baháʼí poets. Erma Hayden was a pianist and composer and served as supervisor of music for Nashville public schools.<ref name=Ebony78/>

In pursuit of a master's degree, Hayden studied under [[W. H. Auden]], who directed his attention to issues of poetic form, technique, and artistic discipline. Auden's influence may be seen in the "technical pith of Hayden's verse".<ref name=norton/> After finishing his degree in 1942, then teaching several years at Michigan, Hayden went to [[Fisk University]] in 1946, where he remained for twenty-three years, returning to Michigan in 1969 to complete his teaching career.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.myblackhistory.net/Robert_Hayden.htm|title=Robert Hayden: African American Writer|website=www.myblackhistory.net|access-date=August 4, 2019}}</ref> Concurrent with his teaching responsibilities at Fisk, he served as poet-in-residence at [[Indiana State University]] in 1967 and visiting poet at the [[University of Washington]] in 1969, the [[University of Connecticut]] in 1971, [[Denison University|Dennison University]] in 1972, and [[Connecticut College]] in 1974.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Buck|first=Christopher|date=2004|title=Hayden, Robert|url=https://oxfordaasc.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195301731.001.0001/acref-9780195301731-e-51187|url-access=subscription|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=February 3, 2021|website=Oxford African American Studies Center|language=en|doi=10.1093/acref/9780195301731.013.51187|doi-broken-date=31 October 2021}}</ref>

As a supporter of his religion's teaching of the [[Baháʼí Faith and the unity of humanity|unity of humanity]], Hayden could never embrace Black separatism.<ref name=Williams87>{{cite book|author=Pontheolla T. Williams|title=Robert Hayden: A Critical Analysis of His Poetry|url=https://archive.org/details/roberthaydencrit0000will|url-access=registration|year=1987|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-01289-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/roberthaydencrit0000will/page/26 26]–27, 66, 154, 162}}</ref> Thus the title poem of ''Words in the Mourning Time'' ends in a stirring plea in the name of all humanity: 
<blockquote>Reclaim now, now renew the vision of<br>
a human world where godliness<br>
is possible and man<br>
is neither gook nigger honkey wop or kike<br>
but man

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;permitted to be man.<ref name=Ebony78/></blockquote>

He died in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], on February 25, 1980, aged 66.<ref name="Poets">{{Cite web|url=https://poets.org/poet/robert-hayden|title=About Robert Hayden {{!}} Academy of American Poets|last=Poets|first=Academy of American|website=poets.org|access-date=August 4, 2019}}</ref>

In 2012 the U.S. Postal Service issued a pane of stamps featuring ten great Twentieth Century American Poets, including Hayden.<ref>[http://www.beyondtheperf.com/stamp-releases/twentieth-century-poets Beyondtheperf.com],</ref>

==Career==
By the 1960s and the rise of the [[Black Arts Movement]], when a more youthful era of African-American artists composed politically and emotionally charged protest poetry overwhelmingly coordinated to a black audience, Hayden's philosophy about the function of poetry and the way he characterized himself as an author were settled. His refusal to revamp himself as indicated by the pictures of the 1960s earned him feedback from a few scholars and analysts. Hayden stayed consistent with his idea of poetry as an artistic frame instead of a polemical demonstration and to his conviction that poetry ought to, in addition to other things, address the qualities shared by mankind, including social injustice. Hayden's beliefs about the relationship of the artist to his poems likewise had impact in his refusal to compose emotionally determined protest sonnets. Hayden's practice was to make separation between the speaker and the movement of the poem.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ir.lib.uwo.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2746&context=etd|title=Feeling With Imagination: Sympathy and Postwar American Poetry|last=De Jong|first=Timothy A.|publisher=Western University|date=2013}}</ref>

The impact of Euro-American innovation on Hayden's poetry and also his continuous assertions that he needed to be viewed as an "American poet" as opposed to a "black poet" prompted much feedback of him as an abstract "Uncle Tom" by African-American critics during the 1960s. However, African-American history, contemporary black figures, for example, [[Malcolm X]], and African-American communities, especially Hayden's native Paradise Valley, were the subjects of a significant number of his poems.<ref name="Poets"/>

On April 7, 1966, Hayden's'' Ballad of Remembrance'' was awarded, by unanimous vote, the Grand Prize for Poetry at the first [[World Festival of Negro Arts]] in Dakar, Senegal.<ref name="Buck04" /> The festival had more than ten thousand people from thirty-seven nations in attendance. However, on April 22, 1966, Hayden was denounced at a [[Fisk University]] conference of black writers by a group of young protest poets led by [[Melvin Tolson]] for refusing to identify himself as a black poet.<ref name="Buck04" />

Hayden was elected to the American Academy of Poets in 1975. His most famous poem is "[[Those Winter Sundays]]",<ref name=Buck04/><ref name=Williams87/> which deals with the memory of fatherly love and loneliness. It ranks among the most anthologized American poems of the twentieth century. He declined the position later called [[United States Poet Laureate]] previously, accepted the appointment for 1976{{ndash}}1977 during [[United States Bicentennial|America's Bicentennial]], and again in 1977–1978 though his health was failing then. He was awarded successive honorary degrees by [[Brown University]] (1976) and Fisk, (1978). In 1977 he was interviewed for television in Los Angeles on ''At One With'' by Keith Berwick.<ref name=Goldstein01>{{cite book|author1=Laurence Goldstein|author2=Robert Chrisman|title=Robert Hayden: Essays on the Poetry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RhH52O53aAIC&pg=PA23|year=2001|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=0-472-11233-3|pages=23, 106}}</ref> In January 1980 Hayden was among those gathered to be honored by President [[Jimmy Carter]] and his wife at a [[White House]] reception celebrating American poetry.<ref>{{cite news|title =Carters host poets|newspaper =Santa Cruz Sentinel|location =Santa Cruz, California|page =22|date =January 4, 1980|url =https://www.newspapers.com/clip/1461680/bahai_robert_hayden_at_white_house/|access-date = December 24, 2014 }}</ref> He served for a decade as an editor of the Baháʼí journal ''World Order''.<ref>{{cite news|title =Poets, writers honor Robert Hayden|newspaper =Baháʼí News|pages =8–9|date =April 1990|url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=12&page=723|access-date = December 24, 2014 }}</ref>

Other famed poems include "The Whipping" (which is about a small boy being severely punished for some undetermined offense), "[[Middle Passage (poem)|Middle Passage]]" (inspired by the events surrounding the ''[[United States v. The Amistad]]'' affair), "Runagate, Runagate", and "[[Frederick Douglass]]".<ref name="Williams87" />

Robert Hayden has often been praised for his work crafting of poems, the unique perspectives in his work, his exact language, and his absolute command of traditional poetic techniques and structures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://0-africanamerican2.abc-clio.com.sultan.tnstate.edu/Search/Display/1396452?terms=robert+hayden|title=Millennium Web Catalog|website=0-africanamerican2.abc-clio.com.sultan.tnstate.edu|access-date=March 25, 2016}}</ref> Hayden is also known as a nature poet and is included in the anthology "''Black Nature: Four Centuries of African American Nature Poetry".'' His poem, "A Plague of Starling," is one of the more famous of his nature-based poems.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Dungy|first=Camille T., ed|url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Black_Nature/WGJ68ddciIEC?hl=en&gbpv=0|title=Black nature: Four centuries of African American nature poetry.|publisher=University of Georgia Press|year=2009|location=Athens, Georgia|pages=128|language=English}}</ref>

Hayden's influences included [[Elinor Wylie]], [[Countee Cullen]], [[Paul Laurence Dunbar]], [[Langston Hughes]], [[Arna Bontemps]], [[Keats|John Keats]], [[W. H. Auden]] and [[Yeats|W. B. Yeats]]. His work often addressed the plight of African Americans, usually using his former home of Paradise Valley slum as a backdrop, as he does in the poem "Heart-Shape in the Dust". He made ready use of black [[vernacular]] and folk speech, and he wrote political poetry as well, including a sequence on the [[Vietnam War]].

On the first poem of the sequence, he said: "I was trying to convey the idea that the horrors of the war became a kind of presence, and they were with you in the most personal and intimate activity, having your meals and so on. Everything was touched by the horror and the brutality and criminality of war. I feel that's one of the best of the poems."<ref name=Goldstein01/>
