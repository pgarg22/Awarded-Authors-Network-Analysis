She joined the Council of the [[Royal Society of Literature]] in 2007.

==Early life==
Born in [[Bootle]], [[Lancashire]], England, Feinstein grew up in [[Leicester]].<ref name=Carcanet /> Her father had left school at 12 and had little time for books, but he was a great storyteller. He ran a small factory making wooden furniture through the 1930s. She wrote, "An inner certainty of being loved and valued went a long way to create my own sense of resilience in later years spent in a world that felt altogether alien. I never altogether lost my childhood sense of being fortunate."<ref Name="Couzyn114">Couzyn (1985), p. 114.</ref>

Feinstein was sent to [[Regent College, Leicester|Wyggeston Grammar School for Girls]] by her mother, "a school as good as Leicester could provide". She wrote poems from the age of 8, which were published in the school magazine. At the end of the war Feinstein's sense of childhood security was shattered by the revelations of the Nazi [[extermination camps]]. She noted, "In that year I became [[Jewish]] for the first time."<ref Name="Couzyn114"/> A recent critic commented: "Alive to her family origins in the [[Russian-Jewish]] diaspora, she developed a close affinity with the Russian poets of this and the last century."<ref name="Schmidt, p. 856">Michael Schmidt: ''Lives of the Poets'', London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 2007, p. 856.</ref>

Feinstein excelled at school work from then on. After [[Newnham College, Cambridge]], she read for the [[bar (law)|bar]], worked at [[Hockerill Anglo-European College|Hockerill Training College]], and then as a university lecturer at the [[University of Essex]] (1967–1970), appointed by [[Donald Davie]].<ref name="Schmidt, p. 856"/>

==Literary career==
Feinstein married and had three sons with her husband, Arnold Feinstein. As she resumed writing she "came to life again", keeping journals, enjoying the process of reading and writing poetry, composing pieces to help her make sense of experience.<ref Name="Couzyn115">Couzyn (1985), p. 115.</ref> She commented that she wanted "plain propositions, lines that came singing out of poems with a perfection of phrasing like lines of music."<ref Name="Couzyn115"/> She was inspired by the poetry of [[Marina Tsvetayeva]] to translate some of her poetry. These poems were published by Oxford University Press and Penguin Books in 1971. She received three translation awards from the [[Arts Council]].<ref Name="Couzyn115"/>

After 1980, when she was made a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Literature]], she became a full-time writer. In 1990, she received a [[Cholmondeley Award]] for Poetry and an Honorary D.Litt. from the [[University of Leicester]].<ref name="BCLit"/> She visited Russia occasionally to research her books and visit friends, who included [[Yevgeny Yevtushenko]].<ref name=Carcanet /> Her writings included 14 novels, many radio plays, television dramas, and five biographies, including ''[[A Captive Lion]]: the Life of Marina Tsvetaeva'' (1987) and ''Pushkin'' (1998). ''[[Ted Hughes]]: The Life of a Poet'' (2001) was shortlisted for the biennial Marsh Biography Prize.<ref>[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article4032558.ece Interview with Elaine Feinstein] in ''The Times''.</ref> Her biography of [[Anna Akhmatova]], ''Anna of all the Russias'', appeared in 2005 and was translated into twelve European languages, including Russian.<ref>[http://www.elainefeinstein.com/ Feinstein biography.]</ref>

Her first novel, ''The Circle'' (1970), written under Tsvetayeva's influence,<ref Name="Couzyn115"/> is "a study of a marriage, mostly through the wife's mind."<ref name="Feminist" >Virginia Blain, Patricia Clements and Isobel Grundy: ''The Feminist Companion to Literature in English. Women Writers from the Middle Ages to the Present'' ([[Batsford Books|Batsford]]: London, 1990), p. 361.</ref> Several novels concern her Jewish roots: ''The Survivors'' (1982), spans the generations before and after the Holocaust, while ''The Border'' (1984) tells of an old woman in [[Sydney]] and her "painful, mysterious... escape from Vienna with her husband in 1939".<ref name="Feminist"/>

Feinstein's poetry was influenced by [[Black Mountain poets]], and by [[Objectivist poets|Objectivists]]. [[Charles Olson]] sent her his "famous letter defining breath '[[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]]'".<ref name="Schmidt, p. 856"/> Feinstein travelled extensively, to read her work at festivals abroad, and as Writer in Residence for the British Council, first in Singapore, and then in [[Tromsø]], Norway. She was a [[Rockefeller Foundation]] Fellow at [[Bellagio (Italian region)|Bellagio]] in 1998; her poems were widely anthologised. Her ''Collected Poems and Translations'' (2002) was a [[Poetry Book Society]] Special Commendation, and she was appointed to the Council of the Royal Society of Literature in 2007. She served as a judge for the Gregory Awards, the Independent Foreign Fiction Award, the Costa Poetry Prize and the Rossica Award for Literature translated from Russian, and in 1995 was chairman of the judges for the [[T. S. Eliot Prize]].<ref name=Carcanet>[http://www.carcanet.co.uk/cgi-bin/indexer?owner_id=219 Elaine Feinstein page], Carcanet Press.</ref> Feinstein participated in the 22nd Aldeburgh Poetry Festival in November 2010 and continued to give readings in various countries.<ref>A podcast of her interview with Robert Seatter is available at [http://www.thepoetrytrust.org/poetry-channel/ The Poetry Trust].</ref>
