==Biography==
Judith Wright was born in [[Armidale, New South Wales]]. The eldest child of [[Phillip Wright]] and his first wife, Ethel, she spent most of her formative years in [[Brisbane]] and [[Sydney]].<ref name="Cornwell2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2000/aug2000/wrig-a31.shtml|title=Australian poet Judith Wright (1915–2000): An appreciation|last=Cornwell|first=Tony|date=31 August 2000|publisher=[[World Socialist Web Site]]|access-date=11 February 2007}}</ref> Wright was of [[Cornish people|Cornish]] ancestry.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yTKFBXfCI1QC&q=bob+hawke+cornwall&pg=PA234|title=The Australian people: an encyclopedia of the nation, its people and their origins|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-521-80789-0|author=James Jupp}}</ref> After the early death of her mother, she lived with her aunt and then boarded at [[New England Girls' School]] after her father's remarriage in 1929. After graduating, Wright studied Philosophy, English, Psychology and History at the [[University of Sydney]].<ref name="Cornwell2" /><ref name="heywood2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.womenaustralia.info/biogs/AWE0114b.htm|title=Wright, Judith Arundell (1915–2000)|last=Heywood|first=Anne|date=11 September 2001|publisher=[[Australian Women's Archives Project]]|access-date=11 February 2007}}</ref> At the beginning of [[World War II]], she returned to her father's station to help during the shortage of labour caused by the war.

Wright's first book of poetry, ''The Moving Image'', was published in 1946 while she was working at the [[University of Queensland]] as a research officer. Then, she had also worked with [[Clem Christesen]] on the literary magazine ''[[Meanjin]],'' the first edition of which was published in late 1947.<ref name="heywood2" /> In 1950 she moved to [[Mount Tamborine, Queensland]], with the novelist and abstract philosopher Jack McKinney. Their daughter Meredith was born in the same year. They married in 1962, but Jack was to live only until 1966.<ref>{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A150293b.htm|title=McKinney, Jack Philip (1891–1966)|last=Wright|first=Judith|year=2000|dictionary=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]|access-date=11 February 2007}}</ref>

In 1966, she published ''The Nature of Love'', her first collection of short stories, through Sun Press, Melbourne. Set mainly in Queensland, they include 'The Ant-lion', 'The Vineyard Woman', 'Eighty Acres', 'The Dugong', 'The Weeping Fig' and 'The Nature of Love', all first published in The Bulletin. Wright was nominated for the 1967 [[Nobel Prize for Literature]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Forteckning over forslag till 1967 ars Nobelpris i litteratur|url=http://www.svenskaakademien.se/sites/default/files/forslagslista_1967.pdf|website=Swedish Academy (Svenska akademien)|access-date=13 January 2018}}</ref>

With [[David Fleay]], [[Kathleen McArthur]] and [[Brian Clouston]], Wright was a founding member and, from 1964 to 1976, President, of the [[Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland]]. She was the second Australian to receive the [[Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry]], in 1991.<ref name="heywood2" />

She was involved in the [[Poets Union]].<ref name=slnswpu>{{cite web | title=Poets Union of New South Wales - records, 1977-2000| website=[[State Library of New South Wales]]| url=http://archival.sl.nsw.gov.au/Details/archive/110312144 | access-date=19 February 2021}}</ref>

For the last three decades of her life, she lived near the New South Wales town of [[Braidwood, New South Wales|Braidwood]].<ref>[http://www.twofiresfestival.com/twofires/judith/ The Two Fires Festival] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224060559/http://www.twofiresfestival.com/twofires/judith/ |date=24 December 2008 }}</ref> She moved to the Braidwood area to be closer to [[H.

==Poet and critic==
Judith Wright was the author of several collections of poetry, including ''The Moving Image'', ''Woman to Man'', ''The Gateway'', ''The Two Fires'', ''Birds'', ''The Other Half'', ''Magpies'', ''Shadow'', ''Hunting Snake,'' among others.

Her work is noted for a keen focus on the Australian environment, which began to gain prominence in Australian art in the years following World War II. She deals with the relationship between settlers, Indigenous Australians and the bush, among other themes. Wright's aesthetic centres on the relationship between mankind and the environment, which she views as the catalyst for poetic creation. Her images characteristically draw from the Australian flora and fauna, yet contain a mythic substrata that probes at the poetic process, limitations of language, and the correspondence between inner existence and objective reality.

Her poems have been translated into several languages, including [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Russian language|Russian]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://historyandphilosophyinqueensland.com/queensland-thinkers/intellectuals-and-thinkers/the-dozen/judith-wright/|title=Judith Wright|last=Buch|first=Neville|website=History and Philosophy in Queensland|access-date=2 February 2018}}</ref> Along with [[Brendan Kennelly]], she is the most featured poet in ''The Green Book of Poetry'', a large [[Ecopoetry]] anthology by [[Ivo Mosley]] (Frontier Publishing 1993), which was published by Harper San Francisco in 1996 as ''Earth Poems: Poems from Around the World to Honor the Earth''.

===''Birds''===
In 2003, the National Library of [[Australia]] published an expanded edition of Wright's collection titled ''Birds''.<ref name = "McKinney7">McKinney (2004) p.&nbsp;7</ref> Most of these poems were written in the 1950s when she was living on [[Tamborine Mountain]] in southeast [[Queensland]]. Meredith McKinney, Wright's daughter, writes that they were written at "a precious and dearly-won time of warmth and bounty to counterbalance at last what felt, in contrast, the chilly dearth and difficulty of her earlier years".<ref name = "McKinney89">McKinney (2004) pp.&nbsp;8–9</ref> McKinney goes on to say that "many of these poems have a newly relaxed, almost conversational tone and rhythm, an often humorous ease and an intimacy of voice that surely reflects the new intimacies and joys of her life".<ref name = "McKinney9">McKinney (2004) p.&nbsp;9</ref> Despite the joy reflected in the poems, however, they also acknowledge "the experiences of cruelty, pain and death that are inseparable from the lives of birds as of humans ... and [turn] a sorrowing a clear-sighted gaze on the terrible damage we have done and continue to do to our world, even as we love it".<ref name = "McKinney9"/>

==Environmentalism and social activism==
Wright was well known for her campaigning in support of the conservation of the [[Great Barrier Reef]] and [[Fraser Island]]. With some friends, she helped found one of the earliest nature conservation movements.<ref name = "McKinney9"/>

Wright was also an impassioned advocate for the [[Aboriginal land rights]] movement. [[Thomas Shapcott|Tom Shapcott]], reviewing ''With Love and Fury'', her posthumous collection of selected letters published in 2007, comments that her letter on this topic to the Australian Prime Minister [[John Howard]] was "almost brutal in its scorn".<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/news/book-reviews/with-love-and-fury-selected-letters-of-judith-wright/2007/03/09/1173166968695.html Tom Shapcott, Book Review, "With Love and Fury: selected letters of Judith Wright", ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 10 March 2007]</ref> Shortly before her death, she attended a march in [[Canberra]] for reconciliation between non-indigenous Australians and the Aboriginal people.<ref name="litweb.net"/>

==Recognition==
[[File:Judith Wright Centre of Contemporary Art.jpg|thumb|The Judith Wright Arts Centre in Fortitude Valley, Australia]]
In June 2006 the [[Australian Electoral Commission]] (AEC) announced that the new federal electorate in [[Queensland]], which was to be created at the [[2007 Australian federal election|2007 federal election]], would be named Wright in honor of her accomplishments as a "poet and in the areas of arts, conservation and indigenous affairs in Queensland and Australia".<ref>{{Cite web

Under the 2009 redistribution of Queensland, a [[Division of Wright|new seat]] in southeast Queensland was created and named in Wright's honour; it was first contested in [[2010 Australian federal election|2010]].

The [[Judith Wright Arts Centre]] in [[Fortitude Valley]], Brisbane is named after her.

On 2 January 2008, it was announced that a future suburb in the district of [[Molonglo Valley]], [[Canberra]] would be named "Wright". There is a street in the Canberra suburb of [[Franklin, Australian Capital Territory|Franklin]] named after her, as well. Another of the Molonglo Valley suburbs was named after Wright's lover, "Nugget" Coombs.<ref>[http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/local/news/general/suburbs-named-in-new-district/419088.aspx Canberra Times, 3 January 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201034339/http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/local/news/general/suburbs-named-in-new-district/419088.aspx |date= 1 February 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Planning and Sustainable Development Directorate|date=|title=Molonglo Valley planning|url=https://www.planning.act.gov.au/planning-our-city/planning-studies/molonglo-valley|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2021-01-15|website=www.planning.act.gov.au|language=en}}</ref>
