'''Evelyn Ward Everett-Green''' (17 November 1856 in London – 23 April 1932 in Funchal) was an English novelist who started with improving, pious stories for children, moved on to historical fiction for older girls, and then turned to adult romantic fiction.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |url=https://stellabooks.com/article/evelyn-everettgreen |title=Evelyn Everett-Green {{!}} Articles: Stella & Rose's Books |website=stellabooks.com |access-date=2019-02-19}}</ref> She wrote about 350 books, more than 200 of them under her own name, and others using the pseudonyms '''H. F. E.''', '''Cecil Adair''', '''E. Ward''' and '''Evelyn Dare'''.

==Early life and work==
Evelyn was born at 7 Upper [[Gower Street, London]]. Her mother was a historian, [[Mary Anne Everett Green]] (née Wood), and her father, George Pycock Green, a portrait and landscape painter. The family were [[Methodism|Methodists]]. She was the second of the family's three surviving daughters and had an older brother.<ref name=":1">{{Cite ODNB |id=58974 |title=Green, Evelyn Ward Everett (1856–1932), writer |first=Hilary |last=Clare |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-58974 |access-date=2019-02-19}}</ref> She was baptised at [[Great Queen Street]] Wesleyan Methodist Chapel on 22 February 1857 as Eveline, but changed her name to Evelyn in later life. Like the rest of her family, she added Everett to her surname in honour of George Green's friend the [[Wesleyanism|Wesleyan]] historian [[James Everett (writer)|James Everett]].<ref name=":1"/><ref name=":0"/>

From earliest childhood, Evelyn invented stories to tell her sisters. She was educated at home until the age of 12, then at [[Gower Street, London|Gower Street Preparatory School]], where she wrote a historical tale about [[Lady Jane Grey]]. Next came a year at [[Bedford College, London]] on a Reid scholarship (1872–1873),<ref name="Feminist">Virginia Blain, Patricia Clements and Isobel Grundy: ''The Feminist Companion to Literature in English. Women Writers from the Middle Ages to the Present Day'' (London: Batsford, 1990), p. 349.</ref><ref name=":0"/> during which she wrote ''Tom's Tempest Victory'', her first novel. She continued to write while studying at the [[London Academy of Music]]. She also worked as a nurse in a London hospital for two years.<ref name="Feminist"/> Her brother's death in 1876 ended plans to go to [[India]] with him. She occupied herself with good works, including [[Sunday School]] teaching and nursing, and later hospital nursing.

==Writing career==
In 1880 ''Tom Tempest's Victory'' became her first published work, under the pseudonym H. F. E.<ref name=":1"/> Though it was soon followed by other works, she found writing at home difficult and town winters unhealthy for her. In 1881 she was still living in Gower Street with her family, but in 1883 she moved outside [[London]] with Catherine Mainwaring Sladen. In the 1890s and early 1900s they had homes in [[Albury, Surrey]].<ref>Class: ''RG11''; Piece: ''188''; Folio: ''10A''; Page: ''16''; GSU roll: ''1341042.''

Kew, Surrey, England: The National Archives of the UK (TNA): Public Record Office (PRO), 1891.</ref>

While in Albury, Everett-Green wrote numerous historical novels and somewhat fewer moral tales for the [[Religious Tract Society]]. Her novel about [[Joan of Arc]] entitled ''Called of Her Country'' (1903), later republished as ''A Heroine of France'', presents Joan as a feminine "Angelic Maid" in white armour, whose inspiring adventures were undertaken in a dutiful spirit. Many of her works have been dismissed by critics as apologies for an oppressive order. The girls' historical romance genre is viewed by such critics as a validation of "traditional", restrictive, domestic-oriented versions of femininity by showing they had long-established historical precedents.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal |last=Skelding |first=Hilary |date=2001-03-01 |title=Redefining the angel in the house: evelyn everett-green and the historical novel for girls |journal=Women's Writing |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=119–138 |doi= 10.1080/09699080100200170|pmid=20196240 |issn=0969-9082}}</ref>

Much of Everett-Green's fiction and non-fiction was meant for girls, but she also wrote boys' adventure stories such as ''A Gordon Highlander'' (1901). Many of her books followed values and themes learnt during her Methodist upbringing. These are clearest in her books targeting children in general. She soon turned to novels for slightly older girls, the genre she is best remembered for. They generally followed development in a household from childhood to adulthood. Careers for women were mentioned without disapproval, but the endings invariably featured marriage for the female heroines.<ref name=":1"/> Contemporary critics, such as one from the ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' said the works were written with "obvious good intention", but the "day of the weepy, fainting, blue-eyed... heroine has vanished."<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://login.flagship.luc.edu/login?qurl=http%3a%2f%2fsearch.proquest.com%2f%3faccountid%3d12163 |title=Flagship: Login |website=login.flagship.luc.edu |access-date=2019-02-20}}</ref> Between 1890 and 1909 she wrote about 50 historical tales before moving to Madeira.

Thereafter she wrote romantic novels for adults, often under the pseudonym '''Cecil Adair'''. According to a modern critic, "Family sagas or romances with a historical adventure setting were her speciality."<ref name="Feminist"/> Contemporary readers enjoyed these for their chaste sensationalism and they had considerable success.<ref name=":1"/> She occasionally collaborated with fellow authors Louisa Bedford and Emma and Beatrice Marshall.<ref name=":1"/>

Evelyn's works were some of the most popular of her generation. She was one of the bestselling authors with her publisher, Stanley Paul.<ref name=":0"/> However, while popular enough to bring in adequate income, they lack real distinction and are now generally read for the light they shed on social backgrounds.<ref name=":1"/>

==Later life and death==
In the 1911 census, Everett-Green, with several servants, is recorded as still living at Albury with Catherine, as "joint heads" of the household.<ref>Class: ''RG14''; Piece: ''3058''; Schedule Number: ''96.'' Ancestry.com. ''1911 England Census'' [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., 2011. ''Census Returns of England and Wales, 1911''. Kew, Surrey, England: The National Archives of the UK (TNA), 1911.</ref> In that year, however, Evelyn and Catherine moved abroad and eventually settled in Quinta Pico de São João, [[Madeira]]. However, during the First World War they both lived at Battramsley near Lymington, Hampshire.<ref name=":1"/> She and Catherine remained there, financially independent and unmarried.<ref name=":0"/> Dominic James has suggested their partnership may have been a romantic one, in line with the same-sex relationship Everett-Green outlined in ''Fast friends; or, David and Jonathan'' (1882), which was published under a pseudonym.<ref>Dominic James, ''Visions of Queer Martyrdom.'' University of Chicago Press, p. 165.</ref>

Evelyn returned to England each year to visit her sister Gertrude and do business with her publishers. She became an active member of the Anglican community in Madeira and was buried in the British Cemetery. There is a memorial plaque on the interior south wall of the English Holy Trinity Church, Funchal.<ref>British Cemetery and Holy Trinity Church archives, Funchal, Madeira</ref><ref name=":1"/> She left a fortune of £5,657. 9s 3d, with the classical scholar [[A. S. F. Gow]] administering her will.<ref>Ancestry.com. ''England & Wales, National Probate Calendar (Index of Wills and Administrations), 1858–1995''[database on-line].

==Later reception==
An extract from ''The Mistress of Lydgate Priory'' (1885): "For a time I was afraid of her, with that fear that is not unwholesome in the young and has a fascination of its own. I liked to see her come into my room, and was sorry when she left. I liked to watch her from my window as she paced in her stately way to and fro upon the terrace.... My grandmother was herself a reserved and silent woman; moreover, she was imbued with a sound and practical common sense that I have never seen equalled, and which gave her a power and discernment rarely to be met with. Every one came to her for advice, as it seemed to me; and seldom did they go away without having received just such counsel as they most needed. The confidence she inspired was something marvellous, as was the deep and true veneration with which all regarded her."<ref>{{Citation |last=Warren |first=Michelle R. |chapter=Lydgate, Lovelich, and London Letters |date=2008 |pages=113–138 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan US |isbn=9781349537365 |doi=10.1057/9780230610293_7 |title=Lydgate Matters}}</ref>

The figure represented in this extract exemplifies the recurring theme of a stern and authoritative matriarch seen in the eyes of an adoring and respectful young woman. This theme has led critics to accuse Everett-Green of apologizing for an oppressive order.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Bolderson |first=Helen |date=April 1994 |title=Christopher Ham and Michael Hill, The Policy Process in the Modern Capitalist State, Harvester Wheatsheaf, Hemel Hempstead, second edition 1993. 210 pp. paper £10.95.

The idea of girls' literature enforcing traditional forms of femininity comes from later commentators such as E. J. Salmon. This has led to a perception that all literature of this kind was reactionary and conservative.<ref name=":2"/>

Hillary Skelding has argued that Everett-Green's historical works maintain a high degree of historical accuracy, due to her mother's background as a historian and other female historians of the era. Some of her narratives focus on the unexceptional, everyday women of history who often acknowledge such domestic authority. She depicts in her fictional mothers and wives greater shrewdness and cleverness than her male counterparts did.<ref name=":2"/> Conversely, Kimberley Reynolds has noted that some such characters are powerful only within the domestic sphere and do not change the conventional patriarchal order. In effect, she only offers the illusion of female empowerment by limiting it to the domestic sphere.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Girls Only? |last=Reynolds |first=Kimberley |pages=125}}</ref>
