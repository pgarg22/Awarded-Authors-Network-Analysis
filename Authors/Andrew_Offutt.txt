'''Andrew Jefferson Offutt V''' (August 16, 1934 – April 30, 2013)<ref name="locobit"/> was an American [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]], and [[erotic literature|erotic fiction]] author.<ref name="locobit"/> He wrote as Andrew J. Offutt, A. J. Offutt, and Andy Offutt. His normal byline, andrew j. offutt, has all his name in lower-case letters. His [[erotica]] appeared under seventeen different pseudonyms, principally '''John Cleve''', '''John Denis''', '''Jeff Morehead''', and '''Turk Winter'''.<ref name="MD">{{Cite news|title = My Dad, the Pornographer|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/08/magazine/my-dad-the-pornographer.html|newspaper = [[The New York Times]]|date = 2015-02-05|access-date = 2016-02-03|issn = 0362-4331|first = Chris|last = Offutt}}</ref><ref name="Trussel">[http://www.trussel.com/books/pseud_o.htm].</ref>  He is the father of novelist [[Chris Offutt]] and professor [[Jeff Offutt]].

''[[The Sword of Skelos]]'' (1979), one of Offutt's contributions to the [[Conan The Barbarian]] saga, included a short, facetious biographical note: "Andrew J. Offutt is the recently 'tired and re-tired', as he puts it, president of the [[Science Fiction Writers of America]]. He loves [[heroic fantasy]] though at 6' 1" he is built for speed, not combat. Kentuckian  Offutt has a number of other books in and out of print, and has been a helpless fan of [[Robert E. Howard]] since birth. Now he calls himself the [[Steve Garvey]] among writers; 'Surely it's every boy's dream to grow up—but not too much—and get to write about Conan". Offutt researches with gusto, both in and out of books, having—briefly and painfully, he says—worn [[chainmail]] and helm and wielded sword. He is also tired of aged, bald, ugly, sexless mages and squeaky females in heroic fantasy".'

==Life and family==
Offutt was born in a log cabin near Taylorsville, [[Kentucky]]. He was married for more than 50 years to Jodie McCabe Offutt of Lexington, Kentucky. They had four children: writer [[Chris Offutt]]; [[Jeff Offutt]], Professor of Software Engineering at George Mason University; Scotty Hyde, copy editor for the ''Park City Daily News'' in Bowling Green, Kentucky; and Melissa Offutt, a sales executive for Sprint in San Diego. Offutt also had five grandchildren, Sam, Steffi, James, Joyce, and Andrew.

==Career in speculative fiction==
[[File:If 195412.jpg|thumb|right|Offutt's first story, "And Gone Tomorrow, appeared in the December 1954 issue of ''If''.]]
Offutt began publishing in 1954 with the story "And Gone Tomorrow" in the magazine ''[[If magazine|If]]''.  Despite this early sale, he did not consider his professional life to have begun until he sold the story "Blacksword" to ''[[Galaxy Magazine|Galaxy]]'' in 1959. His first true science fiction novel was ''Evil Is Live Spelled Backwards'' in 1970. Offutt disliked the title of this book, calling it "embarrassingly amateur".

Offutt wrote numerous novels and short stories, including several in the "[[Thieves World]]" series edited by [[Robert Lynn Asprin]] and [[Lynn Abbey]], which feature his best known character, the thief, Hanse, also known as [[List of Thieves World Characters#Shadowspawn|Shadowspawn]] (and, later, Chance).  His "Iron Lords" series, likewise, was popular. Offutt also wrote two series of books based on characters by [[Robert E. Howard]]. There was a series on Howard's best known character, [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]], and another one on the less known [[Tigers of the Sea|Cormac mac Art]]—an Irish Viking active in [[King Arthur]]'s time. In fact, Offutt wrote about him far more extensively than did Howard himself.

As "John Cleve", Offutt also wrote the 19-book [[erotic]] [[science fiction]] series "Spaceways", over half of which were collaborations.

As an editor Offutt produced a series of five anthologies entitled ''Swords Against Darkness'', which included the first professional sale by [[Charles de Lint]]. From 1976 to 1978 he served as president of the [[Science Fiction Writers of America]] (SFWA).

==Career in erotica==
Offutt wrote at least 420 pornographic/erotic works under seventeen different pen-names and house-names, including Opal Andrews, "Anonymous," Joe Brown, John Cleve, Camille Colben, Jack Cory, Jeremy Crebb, P. N. Dedeaux,<ref name="amazon.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/P.-N.-Dedeaux/e/B001K8LFD2/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_2?qid=1458793230&sr=8-2|title=P. N. Dedeaux}}</ref> John Denis, Jeff Douglas, Farrah Fawkes, Baxter Giles, Alan Marshall, Jeff Morehead, J. (John) X. Williams, Turk Winter, and Jeff Woodson.<ref name="MD"/><ref name="Trussel"/> The first was ''Bondage Babes'', published under the name Alan Marshall by Greenleaf in 1968; the first appearance of his principal pen name, John Cleve, was on ''Slave of the Sudan'' in 1969.<ref name="MD"/>

According to his son Chris Offutt he came to regard Cleve as more a separate persona than a pen name, and his other aliases as Cleve's pen names, not his own. As "Cleve" he published more than 130 works of erotica before the market for erotica dried up about 1985; afterwards, turning to self-publishing, he issued 260 more as Turk Winter (an early "Cleve" pen name) over the next twenty-five years. Thirty more remained unpublished at the time of his death. So prolific was Offutt in this area that in summing up his writing career his son Chris wrote that he "came to understand that my father had passed as a science-fiction writer while actually pursuing a 50-year career as a pornographer."<ref name="MD"/>
