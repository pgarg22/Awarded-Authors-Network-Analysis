==Life==
George Lillo was born in [[Moorfields]], or [[Moorgate]], in the City of London.<ref name=dnb>Steffensen, James L., [https://doi.org/10.1093/ref:odnb/16657 "Lillo, George (1691/1693–1739)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, May 2008, accessed 9 December 2011 ("You do not currently have access to this article"; [https://web.archive.org/web/20150924163038/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/16657 Archived site])</ref> He became a partner in his father's goldsmith's and jewellery business.<ref name=dictionary/>

===Early stage works===
Lillo wrote at least eight plays between 1730 and his death in 1739. His first work in the theatre was the [[ballad opera]] ''[[Sylvia (opera)|Sylvia, or The Country Burial]]'' in 1730. He wrote it in order to reproduce the success of [[John Gay]]'s ''[[The Beggar’s Opera]]'', but Lillo's play received mixed reviews and only showed for three nights at [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]], in November 1730, and for a one-night revival at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] in March 1738, reduced to two acts.<ref name=dnb/>

The following year, Lillo wrote his most famous play, ''[[The London Merchant]], or The History of George Barnwell'' (1731), which is considered one of the most popular and frequently produced plays of the 18th century.<ref name=dnb/> In October 1731 it was presented by royal command in the presence of [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] and [[Caroline of Ansbach|Queen Caroline]].<ref name=dnb/> It was in the genre that came to be called [[melodrama]].<ref>"Theatre-Royal, Covent-Garden", ''[[The Times]]'' 26 September 1818, p. 2</ref> In ''The London Merchant,'' the subject is an apprentice who is seduced by Sarah Millwood, a "lady of pleasure," and then struggles to atone for his indiscretion throughout the remainder of the play, with little success. Lillo shows how "evil breeds evil," and Barnwell's initial dalliance eventually leads him to rob his master and murder his uncle in an attempt to secure the money needed to save Millwood's ostensibly endangered reputation. Her seduction, however, is simply a ruse to exploit his naïveté, so her reputation is never actually in danger.<ref name="Gainor, p">Gainor, p. ?.</ref> Lillo redefined the subject of dramatic tragedy and demonstrated that middle and lower class citizens were worthy of tragic downfalls.<ref name=Hynes/><ref name=Cole/> The 17th century ballad about a murder in Shropshire was the historical foundation for the play. Lillo dedicates the play to [[Sir John Eyles, 2nd Baronet|Sir John Eyles]], a prominent member of the merchant class in London, in a letter before the text and plot begins. Lillo's domestic tragedy reflects a turning of the theatre away from the court and toward the town.<ref name="Gainor, p"/> [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]] introduced "the affecting tragedy of George Barnwell" into his novel ''[[Great Expectations]]''.<ref>The melodrama is purchased by Mr. Wopsle for sixpence and read in full that evening to Mr. Pumblechook and Pip, to the latter's annoyance. See Charles Dickens: ''Great Expectations'' (Richmond, Surrey: Oneworld Classics, 2007 [1861]), Ch. 15, p. 106 {{ISBN|1847490042}}</ref> It was dismissed as a "nauseous sermon" by [[Charles Lamb]], though much admired by Lillo's contemporaries [[Samuel Richardson]] and [[Colley Cibber]], who acted in the original production of the play.

Lillo revived the genre of play referred to as [[domestic tragedy]] (or [[bourgeois tragedy]]).<ref name=Faller>Faller, L. (2004). Introduction to ''The London Merchant''. In J. D. Canfield, ''The Broadview Anthology of Restoration and Eighteenth Century Drama: Concise Edition'' (p. 847). Peterborough, Ontario: Broadview Press.</ref> Even though the [[Jacobean drama|Jacobean stage]] had flirted with merchant and artisan plays in the past (with, for example, [[Thomas Dekker (poet)|Thomas Dekker]] and [[Thomas Heywood]]), ''The London Merchant'' was a significant change in theatre, and in tragedy in particular.<ref name=Hynes/> Instead of dealing with heroes from classical literature or the Bible, presented with spectacle and grand stage effects, his subjects concerned everyday people, such as his audience, the theater-going middle classes, and his tragedies were conducted on the intimate scale of households, rather than kingdoms.<ref name=Hynes>Hynes, Peter.

Lillo was concerned that plays be morally correct and in keeping with Christian values.<ref name="Gainor, p"/><ref>Olaniyan, Tejumola.

===Later years===
Later in the decade, Lillo wrote ''[[Fatal Curiosity]]'' (1737) and ''[[Marina (play)|Marina]]'' (1738).<ref name=works>{{cite book |last=Lillo |first=George |title=The Works of Mr. George Lillo, With Some Accounts of His Life |year=1775 |publisher=London, T. Davies}}</ref> He based ''Marina'' on the play ''Pericles'' by [[William Shakespeare]].<ref name=dnb/> His last play, ''[[Elmerick|Elmerick, or Justice Triumphant]],'' was performed posthumously in 1740.<ref name=works/><ref>"George Lillo." English Drama: Restoration and Eighteenth Century, 1660-1789. Richard Bevis. London and New York: Longman, 1988. 314.</ref> Lillo adapted the anonymous Elizabethan play ''[[Arden of Feversham]]'', which was posthumously performed, first in 1759. It was based on the life of [[Alice Arden]].<ref name=works/>

In his own day, his later plays, other than ''Merchant'', were only moderate successes, and after his death old style tragedies and comedies continued to dominate the stage.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} All of Lillo's plays were produced in London, and only three of them produced any profit.<ref name=dictionary/>

Lillo died at age 48, in 1739, in [[Rotherhithe]], London.<ref name=dnb/>
