The announcement of two parallel marches by parties in opposition gave rise to speculation that a coalition between PTI and PAT was possible.  The chiefs of the two parties never clearly stipulated a formal coalition; but an informal agreement to support each other was achieved.<ref name="Dunyan">{{cite web|url=http://dunyanews.tv/index.php/en/Pakistan/232131-I-meant-people-should-kill-me-Imran-Khan-if-retra|title=I meant people should kill me, Imran Khan if retracted from mission: Qadri|work=dunyanews.tv}}</ref><ref name="Dawn">

===Fatwa on Terrorism===
{{Main|Fatwa on Terrorism}}

The ''[[Fatwa on Terrorism|Fatwa on Terrorism and Suicide Bombings]]'' is a 600-page (Urdu version), 512-page (English version) is an Islamic decree by Qadri which demonstrates from the Quran and Sunnah that terrorism and suicide bombings are unjust and evil, and thus un-Islamic. It was published in London as a book.<ref>

</ref> This [[fatwa]] is a direct refutation of the ideology of [[al-Qaeda]] and the [[Taliban]]. It is one of the most extensive Islamic anti-terrorism rulings, an "absolute" condemnation of terrorism without "any excuses or pretexts" which goes further than ever and declares that terrorism is [[Kafir|kufr]] under [[Sharia|Islamic law]].<ref>

</ref> The launch was organised by [[Minhaj-ul-Quran UK]]. Qadri said during the launch that "Terrorism is terrorism, violence is violence and it has no place in Islamic teaching and no justification can be provided for it, or any kind of excuses or ifs or buts."

The fatwa received widespread media attention and was positively covered by the international press.<ref>

Before it had been released, [[Douglas Murray (author)|Douglas Murray]] described the Fatwa on Terrorism, in an article in the ''[[Evening Standard]]'', as "potentially important", although he said "A single-fatwa will not change the level of denial and self criticism inherent in so much of modern Islam".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23810140-is-this-a-triumph-for-the-islamic-peacemakers.do|title=Is this a triumph for the Islamic peacemakers?|work=The Evening Standard|access-date=1 February 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122104015/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23810140-is-this-a-triumph-for-the-islamic-peacemakers.do|archive-date=22 January 2012}}</ref>

The 512-page English book version of the fatwa, ''Fatwa on Terrorism and Suicide Bombings'', (London: Minhaj-ul-Quran, 2011. {{ISBN|978-0-9551888-9-3}}) has a foreword by [[John Esposito]] and an introduction by [[Joel Hayward]], both of whom share Qadri's scholarly assessment that, regardless of any intention, the evil of terrorism remains evil and must be exposed, opposed and condemned. It also has a certification from the Islamic Research Council of [[Al-Azhar University|Al-Azhar]], Egypt issued on 9 January 2011. 

The ''Fatwa on Terrorism and Suicide Bombings'' has been officially endorsed by [[Al-Azhar University]] in Cairo, Egypt. In January 2011, the fatwa was discussed at the [[World Economic Forum]] Annual Meeting 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weforum.org/sessions/summary/reality-terrorism|title=The Reality of Terrorism|work=The Reality of Terrorism – World Economic Forum|access-date=1 February 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202011617/http://www.weforum.org/sessions/summary/reality-terrorism|archive-date=2 February 2015}}</ref> In June 2011, Pope Benedict XVI received a copy of the fatwa from representatives of Minhaj Interfaith Relations. The Pope reportedly appreciated that it promoted peace, harmony and interfaith dialogue.<ref>

According to one newspaper pundit, the legal-theological opinion by Qadri in his fatwa on terrorism creates an impression that there is a consensus in Islam on the [[Khawarij]].<ref>
