The television show was a critical and financial success for HBO, running seven seasons, from 2008 through 2014.<ref name=NYTimes /> A number of her books have been bestsellers and this series was translated into multiple languages and published across the globe. 

Harris was born and raised in a small town in the [[Mississippi River Delta]] area of the United States. She now lives in [[Texas]] with her husband; they have three grown children and grandchildren.<ref name=BIO/> She began writing from an early age, and changed from playwriting in college to writing and publishing mysteries, including several long series featuring recurring characters.

==Life and career==
Harris was born and grew up in [[Tunica, Mississippi]], in the Mississippi Delta. In her early work she wrote poems about ghosts and teenage angst. She began writing plays while attending [[Rhodes College]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. Her most recent mysteries have been in the [[urban fantasy]] genre. 

After publishing two stand-alone mysteries, Harris began the lighthearted ''[[Aurora Teagarden]]'' books with ''Real Murders,'' nominated as a Best Novel 1990 for the [[Agatha Award]]s. Harris wrote several books in the series before the mid-1990s, when she began branching out into other works.<ref name=NYTimes>Deborah Solomon, "Questions for Charlene Harris: Once Bitten: The writer talks about her 10th vampire novel and the hit TV series it inspired," ''[[New York Times Magazine]]'', May 2, 2010, p. 18.</ref> She did not resume the series until 1999, with the exception of one short story in a ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' anthology titled "Murder, They Wrote".

In 1996, Harris published the first in the ''Shakespeare'' series, featuring cleaning lady detective Lily Bard, set in rural [[Arkansas]]. At the time, a ''New York Times'' interview with Harris noted that she "live[d] in small-town Arkansas".<ref name=NYTimes /> The fifth book in the series, ''Shakespeare's Counselor,'' was published in fall 2001, followed by the short story "Dead Giveaway", published in the ''[[Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine|Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine]]'' in December 2001. Harris has said she is finished with that series. 

Next Harris created ''[[The Southern Vampire Mysteries]]'' series, about a telepathic waitress named [[Sookie Stackhouse]] who works in a [[Northern Louisiana]] bar.<ref name=NYTimes /> The first book, ''Dead Until Dark'', won the [[Anthony Award]] for Best Paperback Mystery in 2001. Each book follows Sookie as she tries to solve mysteries involving [[vampire]]s, [[werewolf|werewolves]], and other supernatural creatures.<ref name=NYTimes /> The series has been published in [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Japan]], [[Spain]], [[Greece]], [[Germany]], [[the Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Argentina]], [[Poland]], [[Serbia]], [[Brazil]], [[Great Britain]], [[Ireland]], [[Mexico]], [[Norway]], [[Finland]], [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], [[Lithuania]], [[Hungary]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Portugal]], [[Iceland]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Romania]], [[Estonia]], and [[Israel]].
