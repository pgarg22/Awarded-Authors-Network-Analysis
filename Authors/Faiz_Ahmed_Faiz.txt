Later in his life, while giving an interview with the [[List of newspapers in Pakistan|local newspaper]], Faiz was asked by the interviewer as if he was a communist. He replied with characteristic nonchalance: "No. I am not, a communist is a person who is a card carrying member of the Communist party ever made. The party is banned in our country.

===Rawalpindi plot and exile===
{{Main|Rawalpindi conspiracy}}

The [[Liaquat Ali Khan]]'s government failure to capture [[Indian occupied Kashmir|Indian-administered Kashmir]] had frustrated the military leaders of the [[Pakistan Armed Forces]] in 1948, including Jinnah.

Although the [[East Pakistan Communist Party (Marxist–Leninist)|East Pakistan Communist Party]] had ultimate success in [[East Pakistan|East-Pakistan]] after staging the [[Bengali Language Movement|mass protest]] to recognise [[Bengali language]] as national language.

After Jinnah founded it, the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] was struggling to survive in [[West Pakistan|West-Pakistan]]. Therefore, Prime minister Liaquat Ali Khan imposed extreme restrictions and applied tremendous pressure on the communist party that ensured it was not properly allowed to function openly as a political party. The conspiracy had been planned by left-wing military officer and [[Chief of General Staff (Pakistan)|Chief of General Staff]] [[Major-General]] [[Akbar Khan (Pakistani general)|Akbar Khan]]. On 23 February 1951, a secret meeting was held at General Akbar's home, attended by other communist officers and communist party members, including Marxist Sajjad Zaheer and communist Faiz.<ref name="The Dawn Newspapers, 2011">{{cite news|last=Zafar Ullah Poshni|title=My Jail Mate|url=http://www.dawn.com/2011/02/15/my-jail-mate.html|access-date=3 June 2016|newspaper=The Dawn Newspapers, 2011|date=15 February 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220121418/http://www.dawn.com/2011/02/15/my-jail-mate.html|archive-date=20 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> General Akbar assured Faiz and Zaheer that the communist party would be allowed to function as a legitimate political party like any other party and to take part in the elections.<ref name="The Dawn Newspapers, 2011"/> But, according to communist Zafar Poshni who maintained, in 2011, that "no agreement was reached, the plan was disapproved, the communists weren't ready to accept General's words and the participants dispersed without meeting again".<ref name="The Dawn Newspapers, 2011"/> However the next morning, the plot was foiled when one of the communist officer defected to the [[ISI (Pakistan)|''ISI'']] revealing the motives behind the plot.

===Translations===
Faiz Ahmad Faiz's poetry has been translated into many languages, including English and Russian. A Balochi poet, [[Mir Gul Khan Nasir]], who was also a friend of Faiz Ahmad Faiz, translated his book ''Sar-e-Wadi-e-Seena'' into [[Balochi language|Balochi]] with the title ''Seenai Keechag aa''. [[Mir Gul Khan Naseer|Gul Khan]]'s translation was written while he was in jail during [[Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto]]'s regime for opposing the government's policies. It was only published in 1980, after [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] toppled Bhutto's government and freed all the political prisoners of his (Bhutto's) regime. [[Victor Kiernan]], British Marxist historian translated Faiz Ahmed Faiz's works into English, and several other translations of whole or part of his work into English have also been made by others;<ref>Omer Tarin, ''Faiz Ahmad Faiz: The Living Verse and its English Translators'', in ''Punjab Journal of the Humanities'', Lahore, Pakistan, Vol 3, 2008, pp. 21–23</ref> a transliteration in Punjabi was made by Mohinder Singh.{{cn|date=November 2021}}
