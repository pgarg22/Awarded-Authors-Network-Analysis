'''John Roman Baker''' is a British poet, playwright and novelist.

== Theatre ==
His first play 'Limitations' launched the first season of the Gay Sweatshop Theatre company.<ref>[http://www.knittingcircle.org.uk/gaysweatshop.html Gay Sweatshop] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029073932/http://www.knittingcircle.org.uk/gaysweatshop.html |date=29 October 2007 }}; Gay Knitting circle; retrieved on 22 November 2007</ref> In 1989, his play 'Crying Celibate Tears' was presented at the Sussex Aids Centre<ref>[http://gay.brighton.co.uk/services.asp Gay Brighton and Hove Services] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028132555/http://gay.brighton.co.uk/services.asp |date=28 October 2007 }}</ref>) within the context of the Brighton Festival. This 'festival within a festival' staged at the Sussex Aids Centre also included work by [[Philip Core]], Peter Burton and Neil Bartlett. 'Crying Celibate Tears' received critical acclaim from the Brighton press, The Guardian and Plays and Players and was the launching pad for [[Aputheatre|Aids Positive Underground Theatre]], the company founded by Baker as a positive cultural response.

In June 1992, Michael Arditti, wrote in [[Plays International & Europe|Plays International]] that: "...in England too the theatrical response [to AIDS] has been maturing ... and has come of age with John Roman Baker's "Crying Celibate Tears Trilogy" ... The keynotes of Mr Baker's writing are already in evidence; a barbed wit, an utter lack of sentimentality and a refusal to shy away from unpalatable truths ... the one horror which is happily absent being political correctness. ... In short, this is the real world: a humorous, harrowing, heartening world, and one which remains engrossing for the entire six hours of its length. ... Seen as a whole, the Trilogy is an overwhelming experience."

His work has been produced in many countries. From 1990–1996 the [[Brighton Festival|Brighton]] and [[Edinburgh Festival]]s often saw the first performances of his new plays. In 1990, his play ''The Ice Pick'' won the "Zap" Award for best theatre at the Brighton Festival jointly with the Satirikon theatre of Moscow.<ref>[http://aputheatre.com/poster12.htm Aputheatre.com Punter Magazine Review June/July 1990]</ref> He was the first dramatist to adapt the work of American artist [[David Wojnarowicz]] for the stage.

He moved to [[Amsterdam]], the Netherlands in 1997,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wilkinsonhouse.com/books/new-book-the-vicious-age-sexuality-transgression-and-redemption-in-amsterdam/|title=NEW BOOK: The Vicious Age – Sexuality, Transgression and Redemption in Amsterdam|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-17}}</ref> where he continued the work of Aputheatre until 2008.  During this period the focus of his work was mainly focused on the personal and social effects of pan-European migration following the collapse of communism.

In 1999 he updated and reworked 'The Ice Pick' for 2 characters under the title 'Heroes'. 'Heroes' was toured by Aputheatre around the Netherlands before being performed in Warsaw as part of the 1st Polish Gay Pride festival. 'The Prostitution Plays' was premiered for Warsaw Gay Pride in 2000 and in 2001 his play 'Sexually Speaking 1+1' was presented in Kiev, Ukraine.

Following its Amsterdam premiere, his play 'Prisoners of Sex' was translated into Italian by Antonio Serrano as 'Prigionieri del Sesso' and has been performed in Milan and Rome.<ref>[http://www.gay.it/channel/cultura/23544/Prigionieri-del-sesso.html Gay.it review];</ref><ref>[http://www.queerblog.it/post/7838/liberi-amori-possibili-iv-rassegna-di-teatro-omosessuale-a-milano Queerblog.it];</ref><ref>[http://www.gay.tv/articolo/houseboy-calciatori-gay-e-sessodipendenti-per-il-week-end/16525/ Gay.tv];</ref>

Short plays from 'Remainers, Apologies Not Included' were rejected by Cast Iron Theatre for an unrehearsed reading in December 2019. Among the two short plays submitted were LGBTQ scenarios which included responses to homelessness, and ostensibly straight men cruising each other on Brighton Palace Pier.

== Personal life ==
John Roman Baker spent his childhood and much of his adolescence in [[Brighton]], England. At the age of 19 he moved to Paris, where for several years he worked at the [[University of London Institute in Paris|British Institute]]. His poetry was encouraged by the then director of the [[University of London Institute in Paris|British Institute]], [[Francis Scarfe]]. Later, in 1974 a volume of his poetry "Poèmes à Tristan" was published in French by [[Gérard Oberlé]], translated by Françoise du Chaxel, and with an introduction by Jeanne Fayard.<ref>[http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb35149642t Bibliothèque nationale de France]; retrieved on 16 January 2017</ref> He has always considered himself foremost a poet and a vein of poetry continues in his plays and novels.

In 1970 he moved from Paris back to Brighton. His poetic novel 'The Dark Antagonist' was published by the Unicorn Bookshop, Brighton in 1973.<ref>The Male Homosexual in Literature: a bibliography, Ian Young, Scarecrow Press Inc. Metuchen, N. J. (1975)</ref>

Unwelcome notoriety was achieved when in 1976 he appeared with Tony Whitehead (later to become the first chairperson of the [[Terence Higgins Trust]]<ref>[http://www.tht.org.uk/aboutus/ourtimeline/1990s/ THT: About Us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060624104314/http://www.tht.org.uk/aboutus/ourtimeline/1990s/ |date=24 June 2006 }}; retrieved on 22 November 2007</ref>) in a Southern Television program<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKIA8Udsi0o Southern Report: Coming Out (Feb 1976)];</ref> about Gay Rights. They were pictured together kissing as one of them met the other off a train at [[Brighton station]]. As a result of this, Whitehead was immediately fired by his employer [[British Home Stores]]. A national outcry galvanised the gay rights movement led by [[Campaign for Homosexual Equality|CHE (The Campaign for Homosexual Equality)]] and [[Gay Liberation Front|GLF (Gay Liberation Front)]].

In 1997 he left Brighton for [[Amsterdam]], where he was given the freedom to create and present new work at the theatre in the former COC Amsterdam building on Rozenstraat until its closure in 2007.

In 2014 he returned to England and now lives and works again in Brighton from where he has created a series of modern historical gay fiction 'The Nick & Greg Books'. The books chart the lives of two gay teenagers, Nick & Greg, who meet as teens in Brighton in the late 1950s. The books chart their lives and relationships from the 1950s to the 1970s. The books chronicle not only the massive social changes that occur, but also key literary and cultural influences. A further book 'Greg at the Station' will be a coda to the series.

In August 2018 and November 2019 he attended the Salon du Livre Gay (Gay Book Fair) in Paris to present 'The Nick & Greg Books' and launch the fourth book in the series 'Greg in Paris' as well as the limited edition hardcover 'Le Far West'.<ref>{{Cite book|last=ROMAN BAKER, JOHN.|title=LE FAR WEST.|date=2019|publisher=WILKINSON HOUSE LTD|isbn=978-1-899713-58-5|location=[S.l.]|oclc=1128199988}}</ref>

In June 2020 a new novel entitled '2020' was published. The book, written immediately before the Covid-19 lockdowns began in France and the United Kingdom, presents two characters, Alex and Paul, seeking to defy the coming crisis.

Politically, he is against [[Libertarian conservatism]], and philosophically he is against [[Stoicism]].
