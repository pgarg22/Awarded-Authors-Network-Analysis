==Background==
Carola Mary Anima Oman was born on 11 May 1897 in [[Oxford]], the second of three children of the military historian Sir [[Charles Oman]] (1860–1946) of [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls]] and his wife Mary (1866–1950), daughter of General Robert Maclagan of the [[Royal Engineers]]. She described a rather sumptuous and sociable childhood in a final book illustrated with photographs: ''An Oxford Childhood''.<ref>London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1976. {{ISBN|0340212659}}</ref>

As a child, Oman wrote several plays that were performed by friends. Another early interest was photography.<ref>''An Oxford Childhood'', passim.</ref> She was sent in 1906 to Miss Batty's, later [[Wychwood School]] in [[Oxford]].<ref>[[Josephine Ransom]], ''Schools of Tomorrow in England'' (London: Bell, 1919).

Carola Oman worked as a [[Voluntary Aid Detachment|VAD]] in England and then in France in 1918–1919: soon after her 1919 discharge, she met Gerald Foy Ray Lenanton (1896–1952), a soldier returning from France who would join his family business as a timber broker. After marrying Lenanton on 26 April 1922, Oman became Lady Lenanton when her husband was knighted in 1946 for his World War II service as director of home timber production. The couple, who remained childless, lived from 1928 at Bride Hall, a [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]] mansion in [[Ayot St Lawrence]], Hertfordshire. In 1965, Oman produced ''Ayot Rectory – A Family Memoir'', about the Sneade family, who had lived in the village from 1780 to 1858.<ref name="ODNB"/><ref>Bookseller's description [http://www.borisbooks.co.uk/ap_carola_oman.html Retrieved 1 August 2012.]</ref> Oman has been quoted as speaking warmly of fellow villager [[George Bernard Shaw]], who had been the Lenantons' first caller at Bride Hall in 1928.<ref>An extract from ''Shaw the Villager...'' by Allan Chapelow (New York: Macmillan, 1962): [https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d=6018875 Retrieved 8 July 2012.]</ref><ref name="Young Edwardians"/> Gerald Lenanton died in 1952 after a period of incapacitation from a stroke.<ref name="Young Edwardians">{{Cite news |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=25 November 1976 |title=Guardian Women: the Young Edwardians |first=Diana |last=Norman |page=11}}</ref>

The novelist [[Georgette Heyer]] was a lifelong friend, who even took the time to compile a 16-page index for Oman's ''Britain against Napoleon'', published in 1942 by [[Faber and Faber|Faber]].<ref>''The Indexer'' 17/1 (April 1990).

Carola Oman's writing career of more than half a century yielded over 30 books of fiction, history and biography for adults and children. Her first publication, a book of verse entitled ''The Menin Road and Other Poems'' (1919), drew on her war work as a probationary [[Voluntary Aid Detachment|VAD]] nurse in Oxford, Dorset, London and France in 1918–1919. She was subsequently included in the 1931 edition of ''The Bookman Treasury of Living Poets'', edited by [[Arthur St. John Adcock]]. However, Oman largely abandoned poetry for the genre of [[historical fiction]]. Her 1924 debut novel ''The Road Royal'' focused on [[Mary Queen of Scots]].<ref name="Georgette Heyer">{{Cite book |first=Jennifer |last=Kloester |title=Georgette Heyer |year=2011 |publisher=Random House |location=London |isbn=978-1402241369 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/georgetteheyersr00kloe_0}}</ref> It was followed by ''[[Princess Amelia of Great Britain|Princess Amelia]]'' (1924),<ref>''The Age'' 27 December 1924, "Recent Fiction" p. 6.</ref>''King Heart'' (on [[James IV of Scotland]]/ 1926),<ref>''The Age'' 27 February 1926, "Recent Fiction" p. 46.</ref> ''Crouchback'' (on the [[Wars of the Roses]]/ 1929),<ref>''Ottawa Citizen'' 21 December 1929, "Current Literature & the Arts" p. 24.</ref>''Major Grant'' ([[Colquhoun Grant (British intelligence officer)|Colquhoun Grant]]/ 1931),<ref>''Sydney Morning Herald'' 24 July 1931, "Novels of the Day" p. 4.</ref> ''The Empress'' (on [[Empress Matilda]]/ 1932),<ref>''Sydney Morning Herald'' 30 December 1932 "Novels of the Day" p. 3.</ref>''The Best of His Family'' (on Shakespeare, 1933),<ref>''The Bookman'' October 1933, Review by Graham Sutton pp. 54–55.</ref> and  ''Over the Water'' (on [[Charles Edward Stuart|Bonnie Prince Charlie]]/ 1935).<ref>''The Observer'' 31 March 1935, "Seven Period Pieces" by Mary Crosbie p. 7.</ref> Oman also had two novels published under the pseudonym C. Lenanton, though her identity was an open secret: ''Miss Barrett's Elopement'' (1929) focusing on [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]]<ref>{{Cite book |first=Michael |last=Lackey |title=Biofiction Histories Mutations & Forms |year=2017 |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon Oxon |isbn=978-1138220393}}</ref> and ''Fair Stood the Wind'' (1930), an early venture of hers into the genre of contemporary fiction.<ref name="Georgette Heyer"/>

While Oman's historical novels were well received, she would herself later speak of them as "very bad" <ref name="Young Edwardians"/> and from the mid-1930s channelled her interest into the past, writing biographies, beginning with ''[[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]]'' (1936), followed by one of [[Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia|Elizabeth of Bohemia]]: ''The Winter Queen'' (1938). However, Oman produced several historical novels for younger readers, notably ''[[Robin Hood]]: Prince of Outlaws'' (1937), cited as "one of the most influential of the juvenile literary publications",<ref>{{Cite book |first=Jim |last=Bradbury |title=Robin Hood; the real story of the English Outlaw |year=2012 |publisher=Amberley Publishing |location=Stroud, Gloucs. |isbn=978-1848681859}}</ref> which remained continuously in print for at least 40 years.<ref name="Young Edwardians"/> Oman's first novel for younger readers: ''Ferry the Fearless'' (focusing on the [[Third Crusade]]), had been published in 1936. Her later output in that genre included ''[[Alfred the Great|Alfred, King of the English]]'' (1939) and ''Baltic Spy'' (1940) (focusing on [[James Robertson (monk)|James Robertson]]).<ref name="Cambridge"/><ref>Amazon listings [https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=ntt_athr_dp_sr_1?_encoding=UTF8&field-author=Carola%20Oman&ie=UTF8&search-alias=books&sort=relevancerank#/ref=sr_pg_1?rh=n%3A283155%2Cp_27%3ACarola+Oman&sort=relevancerank&ie=UTF8&qid=1341747124 Retrieved 8 July 2012.]</ref> Oman also wrote two more contemporary novels for adults – her last: ''Nothing to Report'' (1941)<ref>''The Guardian'' 31 January 1941, "Four Novels" by J.

Oman's signature work was a 1946 biography of [[Horatio Nelson]] that drew on a wealth of material unavailable to [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]], author of the hitherto definitive biography of Nelson, published in 1897. Oman notably gained access to the papers of Lady Nelson assembled by the founder of the [[Monmouth Museum|Nelson Museum, Monmouth]].<ref name="Cambridge"/><ref name="ODNB"/> ''Nelson: a Biography'' won for Oman the ''[[Sunday Times]]'' Prize for English Literature,<ref name="Young Edwardians"/>

Oman's 1953 biography of the [[Peninsular War]] general ''[[John Moore (British army officer)|Sir John Moore]]'' was awarded the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]].<ref>All Poetry site.
