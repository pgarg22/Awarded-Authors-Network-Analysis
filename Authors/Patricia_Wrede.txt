==Books==

===Lyra===
These books are all stand alone stories that are loosely connoted and share a common setting on a world named '''Lyra'''. They are listed here in order of publication. 
# ''Shadow Magic'' (1982)
# ''Daughter of Witches'' (1983)
# ''The Harp of Imach Thyssel'' (1985)
# ''Caught in Crystal'' (1987)
# ''The Raven Ring'' (1994)
* ''Shadows over Lyra'' (omnibus edition including the first three ''Lyra'' novels published) (1997) (Illustrated by [[Anne Yvonne Gilbert]])

The actual chronological order of the books is ''Caught in Crystal'', ''The Raven Ring'', ''Shadow Magic'', ''Daughter of Witches'', and ''The Harp of Imach Thyssel''. The last three are set in the same time period but different nations while the first two are spaced widely apart chronologically and happen well before the events of the last three. A timeline and short world history at the end of ''Shadows over Lyra'' ties everything together and answers a lot of questions.

The omnibus edition of ''Shadow Magic'' is a revised one; the writing is significantly different from that in the original, and reflects her greater experience as a writer. It seems that Wrede rewrote the story for the omnibus, but this is not actually noted anywhere in the book itself.

===The [[Enchanted Forest Chronicles]]===
This series features Princess Cimorene, as she becomes a dragon's princess, rescues said dragon, falls in love, and ultimately saves the [[enchanted forest]]. It is usually marketed for young adults. The fourth book (told from the perspective of Cimorene's son, Daystar) was written and published first, but is considered to properly go last in the series. The 1995 edition of ''[[Talking to Dragons]]'' is significantly different from the original 1985 edition, mostly to make it more consistent with the story in the other books.

# ''[[Dealing with Dragons]]'' (1990)
# ''[[Searching for Dragons]]'' (1991)
# ''[[Calling on Dragons]]'' (1993)
# ''[[Talking to Dragons]]'' (1985, revised 1995)

===Cecelia and Kate===
''with '''[[Caroline Stevermer]]'''''

The authors tell these stories from the [[Grammatical person|first-person]] perspectives of cousins Kate and Cecelia (and, in the third book, two additional characters), who recount their adventures in magic and polite society. These works are unusual in modern fiction in being [[epistolary novel]]s, written using the style of the [[letter game]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Patricia C. Wrede |url=http://enchantedinkpot.livejournal.com/18779.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190427075336/https://enchantedinkpot.livejournal.com/18779.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 April 2019 |website=The Enchanted Inkpot |access-date=27 February 2016 }}</ref>

# ''Sorcery and Cecelia or The Enchanted Chocolate Pot: Being the Correspondence of Two Young Ladies of Quality Regarding Various Magical Scandals in London and the Country'' (1988, reprinted 2003)
# ''The Grand Tour or The Purloined Coronation Regalia: Being a Revelation of Matters of High Confidentiality and Greatest Importance, Including Extracts from the Intimate Diary of a Noblewoman and the Sworn Testimony of a Lady of Quality'' (2004)
# ''The Mislaid Magician or Ten Years After: Being the Private Correspondence Between Two Prominent Families Regarding a Scandal Touching the Highest Levels of Government and the Security of the Realm'' (2006)

* ''Magic Below Stairs'' (2010) was written by Caroline Stevermer alone, and is set in the same universe after ''The Grand Tour'', but before ''The Mislaid Magician''. It follows the character Frederick Lincoln as a child in the house of the Schofields.

- The first two books in this series (''Sorcery and Cecelia'' and ''The Grand Tour'') were published in an omnibus edition, ''Magicians of Quality'', in 2005.

====Plot====
At the beginning of the first book, Katherine Talgarth ("Kate") and her beautiful younger sister Georgina have been taken by their Aunt Charlotte Rushton from Rushton (in [[Essex]]) to [[London]] to experience part of the [[London season|Season]]. Kate's parents, George Talgarth and Celia Rushton, have both died at least five years before. Kate's favorite cousin, Cecelia Rushton ("Cecy"), has been left at home with her brother Oliver and their father, the [[antiquarian]] Arthur Rushton, at Rushton Manor. Oliver and Cecy's mother died when Cecy was quite young. Their father's other unmarried sister, Aunt Elizabeth Rushton, lives with them at Rushton Manor.

===Magic and Malice===
"Mairelon" is a gentleman wizard with unusual talents, and Kim is his streetwise protégée. Together, they foil plots and generally get into trouble. From a reference to the date being thirty years since the [[Reign of Terror|Terror]], the novels take place about 1823, during the [[Regency era]] in its broader sense; however, the author has personally stated that the events of ''Magician's Ward'' take place in 1818.
# ''Mairelon the Magician'' (1991)
# ''Magician's Ward'' (1997)
The two novels have also been published in omnibus editions: in hardcover as ''Magic & Malice'' (1999), and as trade paperback as ''A Matter of Magic''  (2010).

===Frontier Magic===
A trilogy narrated by Eff Rothmer, the "thirteenth child" of the opening book title. Book One covers her childhood, from the age of five (when her parents move west to the edge of the expanding [[American frontier]]) to shortly after her eighteenth birthday. Books Two and Three deal with an adult Eff's work as an explorer, scientist, and magician beyond the edge of the frontier.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wrede|first1=Patricia|title=Frontier Magic|url=http://pcwrede.com/books/frontier-magic/|website=Patricia C. Wrede: Six Impossible Things|access-date=2015-04-12}}</ref>

# ''Thirteenth Child'' (2009)
# ''Across the Great Barrier'' (2011)
# ''The Far West'' (2012)

===Others===
* ''The Seven Towers'' (1984)
* ''Snow White and Rose Red'' (1989)
* ''[[Book of Enchantments]]'' (1996)
* ''Star Wars, Episode I – The Phantom Menace'' (Jr. Novelization) (1999)
* ''Star Wars, Episode II – Attack of the Clones'' (Jr. Novelization) (2002)
* ''Star Wars, Episode III – Revenge of the Sith'' (Jr. Novelization) (2005)
''The Seven Towers'' is a stand-alone fantasy novel.

''Snow White and Rose Red'' is a [[fairytale fantasy]], being a retelling of [[Grimm Brothers|the Brothers Grimm]] fairy tale "[[Snow White and Rose Red]]" (not "[[Snow White]]") set in Elizabethan England, and including elements of the [[Thomas the Rhymer]] ballad as well.
