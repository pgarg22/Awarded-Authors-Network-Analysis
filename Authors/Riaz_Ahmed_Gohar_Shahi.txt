==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Shahi was born on 25 November 1941 in the village of [[Dhok Gohar Shah]] in the district of [[Rawalpindi]] of [[British India]]. He is a fifth generation descendant of the [[Sufi]] Baba Gohar Ali Shah.

At the age of twenty, when he was the owner of F.Q. Steel Industries, Shahi began to search for [[spirituality]]. Eventually he became disillusioned in this search and returned to work. Shahi then married and had three children.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Religion of God|last=Gohar Shahi|first=Riaz Ahmed|year=2000|publisher=Balboa Press|location=United States|isbn=978-1-45254-908-8|pages=71 |access-date=13 July 2013|url=http://bookstore.balboapress.com/Products/SKU-000528516/the-religion-of-god-divine-love.aspx}}</ref>

In 1975, he went to [[Sehwan Sharif]] for self-mortification; he spent a period of three years in the mountains of Sehwan Sharif and the forest of Laal Bagh in self-purification, "for the sake of God's love".<ref>{{cite book|title=The Religion of God|last=Gohar Shahi|first=Riaz Ahmed|year=2000|publisher=Balboa Press|location=United States|isbn=978-1-45254-908-8|pages=xi |access-date=1 July 2012|url=http://bookstore.balboapress.com/Products/SKU-000528516/the-religion-of-god-divine-love.aspx}}</ref>

===Legal persecution and exile===
He and many of his followers<ref name="thepersecution">{{cite web|url=http://www.thepersecution.org/ussdcirf/usirf2001.html|title=Int'l Religious Freedom Report – May 2001|publisher=The Persecution.org|date=1 May 2001|access-date=9 March 2010}}</ref> have been convicted under Islamic [[blasphemy]] laws<ref name="moon">{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/weekly/cowas/20020210.htm |title=The Man in the Moon |author=Ardeshir Cowasjee |publisher=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn newspaper]] |date=10 February 2002 |access-date=13 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023234052/http://www.dawn.com/weekly/cowas/20020210.htm |archive-date=23 October 2010 |author-link=Ardeshir Cowasjee }}</ref> by an antiterrorist court in [[Sindh]].<ref name="hrrpt">{{cite web|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2000/sa/710.htm| title=Country Reports on Human Rights Practices by United States of America|publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]]|date=23 February 2003|access-date=7 March 2010}}</ref> After he fled to [[England]], Shahi was convicted ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'',<ref name="thepersecution"/><ref name="hrrpt"/> receiving sentences that totaled approximately 59 years.<ref name="moon"/>

===Disappearance===
Shahi was reported to have disappeared in 2001, in [[London]]; afterwards, sightings of him were reported around the world of people claiming to have met and received spiritual guidance from him.<ref name="SL2012">{{cite web|url=http://www.thesundayleader.lk/2012/01/01/spreading-divine-love-messiah-foundation-international/|title=Spreading Divine Love Messiah Foundation International|publisher=Sunday Leader|date=1 January 2012|access-date=1 January 2012}}</ref>

In February 2002, prior to any decision on appeals filed with the [[High Court of Sindh]], [[Ardeshir Cowasjee]] claimed in an article he wrote for the Pakistani newspaper ''[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]'', that unnamed people who identified themselves to him as office-bearers of the All-Faith Spiritual Movement told him that Gohar Shahi died abroad, but this report was unconfirmed.<ref name=moon/>

There have been rumours of him dying, with some sources reporting that he died in 2001 and others saying he died in 2003. According to the ''Pakistani Press Foundation'' Shahi died in 2001.<ref name="UNHCR"/> An article from 2006 in the ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'' reports that Shahi died in 2003,<ref name="UNHCR"/> and a 2009 article in ''[[Your Local Guardian]]'' also says that he was reported to have died in 2003.<ref name="YLG1"/> However, none of these reports have been confirmed, as there is no body.

On the other hand, the Indian news agency PTI reported in 2008 that Shahi was based in the United Kingdom after being convicted of blasphemy by the High Court of Sindh.<ref name="UNHCR"/> This view is supported by the ''Indian Express'' which reported in 2008 that Shahi had fled to the United Kingdom and was presently based there.<ref name="IndianExpress">{{Citation|title=HC stays deportation of 67 Pakistani nationals|newspaper=The Indian Express|location=New Delhi|date=19 November 2008|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/hc-stays-deportation-of-67-pakistani-nationa/387834/|access-date=9 October 2009}}</ref> ''Zee News'' also supported this claim.<ref name="Zee">{{Cite news|title=Delhi HC seeks response from Centre on Pakistan nationals' plea|newspaper=Zee News|author=Bureau Report|location=New Delhi|date=17 December 2008|url=http://www.zeenews.com/states/2008-12-17/491805news.html|access-date=7 May 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130217024858/http://www.zeenews.com/states/2008-12-17/491805news.html|archive-date=17 February 2013}}</ref> The Hindustan Times has reported that he is "serving a life term".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/67-Pakistanis-in-Tihar-who-don-t-want-to-return-home/Article1-354375.aspx|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130125063742/http://www.hindustantimes.com/67-Pakistanis-in-Tihar-who-don-t-want-to-return-home/Article1-354375.aspx|url-status=dead|archive-date=25 January 2013|title=67 Pakistanis in Tihar who don't want to return home|work=Hindustan Times|date=27 November 2008|author=Abhishek Sharan|access-date=25 April 2010}}</ref> The ''Sunday Leader'' in Sri Lanka stated that Shahi disappeared in 2001 and sightings of him were thereafter reported around the world.<ref name="SL2012"/>

Of the two factions of Shahi's followers, the ''Anjuman Serfaroshan-e-Islam'' had asserted that Shahi died, and built a tomb for him at the Markazi Aastana in [[Kotri]], where devotees performed [[pilgrimage]].<ref name="moon"/> 
The MFI, in contrast, declares that he merely disappeared.<ref name="YLG1">{{cite news|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/local/topstories/4645892.Croydon_religious_leader_faces_life_in_Pakistani_jail_for_his_beliefs|title=Croydon religious leader faces life in Pakistani jail for his beliefs|work=Your Local Guardian|date=30 September 2009|access-date=6 March 2010|first=Kirsty|last=Whalley}}</ref>

=== Claims and criticism ===
Claims made by Shahi and his followers have been strongly opposed by orthodox Islamic theologians in [[Pakistan]] and abroad.<ref name="moon"/> Shahi has been accused of claiming the status of [[prophet]] but denied such accusations.<ref name="DAWN"/><ref name="moon"/> His teachings have been condemned by Muslim religious leaders and the Pakistani government.<ref name="Daily Times">{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_8-7-2004_pg7_43|title=Pakistan's Supreme Court upholds ban on a Shahi disciple's book|publisher=[[Daily Times (Pakistan)|The Daily Times]]|date=8 July 2004|access-date=13 July 2013}}</ref><ref name="AsiaToday">{{Citation | newspaper = Asia Today | title = Chai with...His Holiness Younus AlGohar of Messiah Foundation International | date = September 2014 | url = https://asiatodayaz.com/newspapers/2014/October_2014.pdf | access-date = 7 October 2014 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141010125013/https://asiatodayaz.com/newspapers/2014/October_2014.pdf | archive-date = 10 October 2014 }}</ref>

Shahi also predicts that the world would end in the year 2026 due to a comet heading towards earth.<ref name="jobshire"/><ref name="Guardian"/><ref name="independent"/> He claims the comet will be the cause of "total destruction" though mentions that "in order to intimidate [mankind]...God plans destruction on a small scale".<ref>{{cite book|title=The Religion of God|last=Gohar Shahi|first=Riaz Ahmed|year=2000|publisher=Balboa Press|location=United States|isbn=978-1-45254-908-8|pages=36 |access-date=13 July 2013|url=http://bookstore.balboapress.com/Products/SKU-000528516/the-religion-of-god-divine-love.aspx}}</ref>

Many attempts were made on the lives of Shahi and [[Younus AlGohar]] including a [[petrol bomb]] thrown into AlGohar's residence in [[Manchester]], where Shahi stayed when he toured the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Religion of God|last=Gohar Shahi|first=Riaz Ahmed|year=2000|publisher=Balboa Press|location=United States|isbn=978-1-45254-908-8|pages=xi |access-date=13 July 2013|url=http://bookstore.balboapress.com/Products/SKU-000528516/the-religion-of-god-divine-love.aspx}}</ref><ref name="Attempts">{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/athens/acropolis/2717/page3.html|title=Who is Holiness|publisher=via Yahoo Geocities|access-date=9 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011123051444/http://www.geocities.com/athens/acropolis/2717/page3.html|archive-date=23 November 2001}}</ref> A man attempted to attack him with a [[hand grenade]] during a discourse at his home in [[Kotri]], [[Pakistan]].<ref name="Attempts"/> A bounty was put on his head in Pakistan.<ref name="Attempts"/>

The alleged images induced greater legal and religious opposition.<ref name="10 held for raising slogans in favour of Gohar Shahi"/> Shahi has also supported this claim, saying that God had revealed the images of Shahi on the [[Moon]] and various locations, for which Shahi himself was not responsible, and if questions should be raised, they should be raised to God.<ref name="GSInterview"/> Messiah Foundation International asserts the alleged images to be signs from God, pointing to Shahi being the awaited [[Mahdi|Mehdi]]; they quote religious texts<ref name="SI">{{Citation|title= 'We are spiritually connected to the Awaited Ones'-Messiah Foundation Intl|place = Colombo, Sri Lanka|pages=4|year=2010}}</ref> as well as sayings from the likes of [[Nostradamus]],<ref name="manonmoon">{{Cite web| title = The Man on the Moon that Nostradamus Prophesized| url = http://www.themanonthemoon.com/| access-date=18 March 2010}}</ref> and [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]] to support it.

Journalists in [[Pakistan]] asked Shahi,
<blockquote>"Many believe that you are the Mehdi, and God has revealed signs unto them which say that you are the Mehdi, but you do not officially announce that you are the Mehdi. Why?" Shahi gestured towards himself and answered, "Does Imam Mehdi not know the law of Pakistan? He knows that the law of Pakistan declares that 'whosoever claims to be the Mehdi, put him in jail'. I have given the signs of his [Mehdi's] characteristics, which the Mehdi knows and none other. Now, it is up to people to recognise him and believe him".<ref name="GSInterview">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1OFtIKneQI|title=Gohar Shahi interview with Scholars|publisher=via YouTube|access-date=13 March 2010}}</ref></blockquote>

On 18 November 1997, after appearing in court before Justice Rasheed A. Razvi of Sindh High Court Hyderabad Circuit, Shahi said, "The only justification to be Hazrat Imam Mehdi is the mark on [one's] back which can prove his existence".<ref name="DAWN">{{cite news| title=Gohar Shahi, chief of Anjuman-e-Sarferoshan-e-Islam|newspaper=Karachi News|date=18 November 1997|agency=DAWN|location=Karachi}}</ref>

Of the groups following Shahi, Messiah Foundation International claims that Shahi is the awaited Mehdi, Messiah, and Kalki Avatar while ''Anjuman Serfaroshan-e-Islam'' did not. According to MFI's website, Shahi is the Awaited Messiah, but they deny the notion that Shahi is another form of Jesus and claim that Jesus has also returned to support the Mehdi.<ref>{{cite web| title = About Imam Mehdi| url = http://www.goharshahi.us/about/ |  access-date = 13 July 2013}}</ref>
