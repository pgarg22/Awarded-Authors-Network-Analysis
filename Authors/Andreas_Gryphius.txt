'''Andreas Gryphius'''  ({{lang-de|Andreas Greif}}; 2 October 1616{{snd}}16 July 1664) was a German poet and playwright. With his eloquent sonnets, which contains "The Suffering, Frailty of Life and the World", he is considered one of the most important poets of the German baroque. He was one of the first improvers of German language and poetry.

Gryphius was born and raised in Glogau ([[Głogów]]), [[Duchy of Głogów]], [[Habsburg Silesia|Silesia]]. At the age of 33, he married Rosina Deutschländer, with whom he had six children, Christian, Constantin, Anna Rosine, Theodor, Maria Elisabeth, and Daniel.

==Life==

===Early life===
Andreas Gryphius was the son of Paullus Gryphius, a respected [[clergy]]man and a Lutheran archdeacon of Glogau, originally from [[Uthleben]] and Paullus' third wife,{{sfn|Zedler|Ludovici|1735|p=1159}} Anna (née Eberhardin),{{sfn|Budde|1730|p=668}} who was 32 years younger than her husband, the daughter of a businessman from [[Wschowa|Fraustadt]], the councilor Jonas Deutschländer the Elder (died in 1661) and Anna Sachse.{{sfn|Spahr|1996|pp=131–144}} He was born in Großglogau ([[Głogów]]). The family name was originally "Greif" and had been [[Latin]]ised to "Gryphius" by Andreas' paternal great-grandfather (Peter Greif von Heringen).<ref>Monath, Wolfgang (1966). "[https://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz24414.html#ndbcontent Gryphius, Andreas]" {{in lang|de}}, in: ''Neue Deutsche Biographie''. Vol. 7. Berlin: Duncker&nbsp;&amp; Humblot. p.&nbsp;242–246; here: p.&nbsp;242. Online version retrieved 2017-05-28. The entry begins with information about Gryphius's family in abbreviated form: "V[ater] Paul (1560–1621) ... (E[nkel] d[es] Pastors Peter in Heringen, der seinen Namen Greif latinisierte)" [''English translation'': "father Paul (1560–1621) ... (grandson of Pastor Peter in Heringen, who Latinized his name, which was 'Greif')"].</ref> Left early an orphan and driven from his native town by the troubles of the [[Thirty Years' War]], he received his schooling in various places, but notably at Freistadt (Polish: [[Wschowa]]), where he enjoyed an excellent classical education.<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Gryphius, Andreas|volume=12|pages=642–643}}</ref>

==Career in poetry==
In 1634 he went to [[History of Gdańsk|Danzig]] (Polish:[[Gdańsk]]) where he met professors [[Peter Crüger]] and [[Johann Mochinger]] at the Danzig Gymnasium, who introduced Gryphius to the new German language poetry. Crüger had for years close contacts to [[Martin Opitz]], who became known as 'father of German poetry'. Greatly influenced by Crüger, he is the only one Gryphius dedicated poems to. Gryphius wrote Latin language poetry, German poems and sonnets.

The same year that Gryphius arrived, the printer [[Andreas Hünefeld]] published [[Martin Opitz]]'s ''Buch von der deutschen Poeterey'' (Book of German Poetry). The same publisher printed Opitz's translation ''Tetrastichen des Pibrac'' (Tetrasticha of Pibrac, or four verse) and ''Antigone''. Among Gryphius' benefactors  was the city's secretary [[Michael Borck]], who wrote a German version of the life of Jesus Christ. Borck's illustrated book is still at the [[Biblioteka Gdańska PAN|Gdańsk library]]. Coming from war riddled Silesia, taking refuge at the big international harbor and a [[Poland|Polish]] city, greatly stimulated Gryphius. In 1635 he published his second epos of ''[[Herodes (epic poem)|Herodes]]'', ''Dei Vindicis Impetus et Herodis Interitus''. He dedicated this to the city state council.

In 1636, while still in Danzig, he published the ''Parnassus renovatus'' in praise of his mentor and patron, the eminent [[jurist]] [[Georg Schönborner]] (1579–1637).{{sfn|Bach|2014|p=148}} Later the same year Gryphius became the tutor of Schönborner's two sons, on Schönborner's estate near Freystadt, in Silesia (today, [[Kożuchów]], Poland).<ref name="NDB-242">Monath (1966), p. 242.</ref> A highly educated scholar, Schönborner held various government administrative posts and by that time had been honored by [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Ferdinand II]] with the title of [[Imperial Count Palatine]] (Hofpfalzgraf).<ref name="Palm-ADB">Palm, Hermann (1879). "[https://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz24414.html#adbcontent  Gryphius, Andreas]" {{in lang|de}}, in: ''Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie''. Vol. 10. Leipzig: Duncker&nbsp;&amp; Humblot. p.&nbsp;73–82; here: pp. 74–75. Online version retrieved 2017-05-28.</ref> On 30&nbsp;November 1637, Schönborner recognized Gryphius's poetic talent by bestowing upon him the title of ''poeta laureatus'' and master of [[philosophy]], as well as a patent of nobility (of which Gryphius, however, never made use).<ref name="Palm-ADB"/><ref>Monath (1966), pp.&nbsp;242–243.</ref> Schönborner died less than a month later, on 23&nbsp;December 1637.<ref>Palm (1879), p.&nbsp;75.</ref>

While staying with Schönborner, Gryphius completed his first collection of poems, ''Sonnete'' ("Sonnets"), which was published in 1637 by Wigand Funck in Lissa (today [[Leszno]], Poland), and is also known as the ''Lissaer Sonettbuch'', after the town.{{sfn|Spahr|1996|pp=131, 135-136}} The collection of 31 [[sonnet]]s includes some of his best known poems, such as "Vanitas vanitatum, et omnia vanitas", later titled "Es ist alles eitel" (All is vanity), about the effects of war and the transitoriness of human life; "Menschliches Elende" (Human misery); and "Trawrklage des verwüsteten Deutschlandes" (Lament of devastated Germany).{{sfn|Spahr|1996|pp=135-136}}

In 1632, he had witnessed the pillaging and burning of the Silesian town of [[Kożuchów|Freystadt]] by Swedish troops, and immortalized the event in his poem ''Fewrige Freystadt''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} Also in 1637 he went to continue his studies at [[Leiden]], where he remained for six years, both hearing and delivering lectures. Here he fell under the influence of the great Dutch dramatists, [[Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft]] and [[Joost van den Vondel]], who largely determined the character of his later dramatic works.<ref name="EB1911"/>

In 1635 with the ''Prager Frieden'' ([[Peace of Prague (1635)|Peace of Prague]]), the [[Habsburg]]s took control over in Silesia again and persecuted Protestants and closed their churches. In 1638 Paul Gryphius, the brother of Andreas, received a position as Superindendant at [[Krosno Odrzańskie|Crossen an der Oder]] (Krosno Odrzańskie) in [[Brandenburg]] from the Elector [[Georg Wilhelm of Brandenburg]]. Paul was for several years banned from Silesia for of being a Protestant, and Andreas dedicated and sent him several poems for the start of his new position.

==Travel and dramatic work==
After travelling in [[France]], [[Italy]] and South [[Germany]], Gryphius settled in 1647 at [[Fraustadt]], where he began his dramatic work, and in 1650 was appointed syndic of [[Glogów|Glogau]], a post he held until his death. A short time previously he had been admitted under the title of ''The Immortal'' into the [[Fruitbearing Society|Fruchtbringende Gesellschaft]] ("Fruitbearing Society"), a literary society, founded in 1617 by Ludwig, prince of [[Anhalt-Köthen]] on the model of the Italian academies.<ref name="EB1911"/>

Gryphius grew up during the [[Thirty Years' War]] and witnessed the destruction of large parts of Germany, which had lasting effects for centuries. Not yet an adult himself, he saw the child of a benefactor (Crüger) die, and prepared another (Schönborner) for his approaching death.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} It is therefore not surprising that some morbid disposition, and his melancholy temperament, fostered by the misfortunes of his childhood is largely reflected in his lyrics, of which the most famous are the ''Kirchhofsgedanken'' ("Cemetery thoughts", 1656). His best works are his comedies, one of which, ''Absurda Comica, oder Herr Peter Squentz'' (1663), is evidently based on the comic episode of [[Pyramus]] and [[Thisbe]] in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''. ''Die geliebte Dornrose'' (1660), written in a Silesian dialect, contains many touches of natural simplicity and grace, and ranks high among the comparatively small number of German dramas of the 17th century. ''Horribilicribrifax'' (1663), founded on the ''[[Miles Gloriosus (play)|Miles Gloriosus]]'' of [[Plautus]], is a rather labored attack on pedantry. Besides these three comedies, Gryphius wrote five tragedies. In all of them the tendency is to become wild and bombastic, but he had the merit of at least attempting to work out artistically conceived plans, and there are occasional flashes both of passion and of imagination. His models seem to have been [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and [[Vondel]]. In ''Carolus Stuardus'' (1657) he dramatised events of his own day, namely the death of King [[Charles I of England]]; his other tragedies are ''Leo Armenius'' (1650); ''[[Catharina von Georgien]]'' (1657), ''Cardenio und Celinde'' (1657) and ''Papinianus'' (1659). No German dramatic writer before him had risen to so high a level, nor had he worthy successors until about the middle of the 18th century.<ref name="EB1911"/>
