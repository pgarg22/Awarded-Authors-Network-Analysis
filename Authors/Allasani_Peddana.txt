He wrote the first major Prabandha, a form of fictional poetry in [[Telugu literature|Telugu]], and for this reason, he is revered as ''Andhra Kavita Pitamahudu'' (''the grand father of Telugu poetry''). It is believed that he was also a minister in the king's court and is hence sometimes referred as ''Peddanaamaatyudu'' ([[Sandhi]]: Peddana + Amaatyudu = Peddana, the minister). He dedicated his works to king [[Krishnadevarayalu]].

===Lores===
* The emperor himself lifted and bore the weight of the palanquin in which Peddana was seated.
* He was bestowed with Kanakabhishekam by the king.
* He was the only poet who had the privilege of mounting the royal elephants.
*On the demise of  Sri KrishnaDevaRayalu the poet Peddana expressed his profound sorrows telling that " Atti Krishna Rayala thoti divikegaleka brathiki yundithi jeevatchavambu naguchu "
Meaning I became a living dead by not going to heaven along with Sri Krishna Deva Raya .

==Works==
His famous work was ''Swaarochisha Manu Sambhavam'' (also known as ''Manu Charitramu''). This work is the development of an episode in [[Markandeya]] Puranam relating to the birth of Svarochishamanu, who
is one of the fourteen [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]]s. Pravarudu is a pious [[Brahmin]] youth who goes to [[Himalayas]] for sight seeing. In Himalayas [[Varudhini]], a [[Gandharva]] girl falls in love with him, but Pravara rejects her love as he is already married. Knowing this a [[Gandharva]] youth who was earlier rejected by Varudhini assumes the form of Pravara and succeeds to win her love. To them is born Svarochi, the father of SvArochishamanu.<ref>{{cite book| first = Raju | last = P.T |author2=Rao | title = A Telugu Literature | location = India | publisher = Onal Book House }}</ref>

Some of his other famous works such as ''Harikathaasaaramu'' are untraceable now.
*The Great king Krishna Devarayalu ornamented Peddana's leg with a big golden bangle/bracelet called " GANDA PENDERAM " as a mark of excellent poetry
