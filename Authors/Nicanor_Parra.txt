'''Nicanor Segundo Parra Sandoval''' (5 September 1914 – 23 January 2018) was a Chilean poet and physicist. He was considered one of the most influential Chilean poets of the Spanish language in the 20th century, often compared with [[Pablo Neruda]]. Parra described himself as an "[[Anti-poetry|anti-poet]]," due to his distaste for standard poetic pomp and function; after recitations he would exclaim ''"Me retracto de todo lo dicho"'' ("I take back everything I said").

Parra, the son of a schoolteacher, was born in 1914 in [[San Fabián de Alico]], near [[Chillán]], in Chile.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nicanor Parra un antipoeta, matemático y físico|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/812957.html|work=EL UNIVERSAL|publisher=EL UNIVERSAL, Compañía Periodística Nacional|access-date=21 June 2012|language=es|date=1 December 2011}}</ref> He came from the artistically prolific [[Parra family]] of performers, musicians, artists, and writers. His sister, [[Violeta Parra]], was a folk singer, as was his brother [[Roberto Parra Sandoval]].

In 1933, he entered the [[Teacher education|Instituto Pedagógico]] of the [[Universidad de Chile (university)|University of Chile]], where he qualified as a teacher of mathematics and physics in 1938, one year after the publication of his first book, ''Cancionero sin Nombre''. After teaching in Chilean secondary schools, in 1943 he enrolled in [[Brown University]] in the United States to study physics. In 1948, he attended [[Oxford University]] to study cosmology.<ref>[http://www.quepasa.cl/articulo/6_425_9.html Los desconocidos años de Nicanor en Oxford], ''Qué Pasa'' (in Spanish), 5 August 2009</ref> He returned to Chile as a professor at the Universidad de Chile in 1952. Parra served as a professor of [[theoretical physics]] at the University of Chile from 1952 to 1991, and was a visiting professor at Louisiana State University, New York University, and Yale University.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.loc.gov/catbird/2018/01/literary-treasures-chilean-poet-nicanor-parra-reading-from-his-work/|title=Literary Treasures: Chilean Poet Nicanor Parra Reading from his Work {{!}} From the Catbird Seat: Poetry & Literature at the Library of Congress|last=Holmes|first=Anne|date=2018-01-23|website=blogs.loc.gov|access-date=2019-05-25}}</ref> He read his poetry in England, France, Russia, Mexico, Cuba, and the United States. He published dozens of books.

His collection ''Poemas y Antipoemas'' (1954) is a classic of Latin American literature, one of the most influential Spanish poetry collections of the twentieth century. It is cited as an inspiration by American Beat writers such as [[Allen Ginsberg]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/story/2011/12/01/cervantes-prize-nicanor-parra.html | work=CBC News | title=Chilean poet Nicanor Parra wins Cervantes Prize | date=1 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Nicanor Parra Havana 1965|url=http://www.allenginsberg.org/index.php?page=nicanor-para-havana-1965|work=Allen Ginsberg Project|publisher=Allen Ginsberg Project|access-date=21 June 2012}}</ref>
