In 2008, Sanderson started a podcast with author [[Dan Wells (author)|Dan Wells]] and cartoonist [[Howard Tayler]] called ''[[Writing Excuses]]'', involving topics about creating genre writing and [[webcomic]]s.

==Life and career==
===Early life and education===
Brandon Sanderson was born on December 19, 1975, in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]].<ref name="writertopia"/><ref name="mormon"/>  He was the eldest of four children. Sanderson became a passionate reader of [[high fantasy]] novels while a teenager, and he made several early attempts at writing his own stories.<ref name="About"/> After graduating from high school in 1994, he went to [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU) as a [[biochemistry]] major.  He took a two-year leave of absence from 1995 to 1997 to serve as a volunteer [[Missionaries (LDS Church)|missionary]] for the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] and was assigned to serve in [[South Korea]].<ref name="About"/>

After completing his missionary service, Sanderson returned to BYU and changed his [[major (academic)|major]] to [[English literature]]. While an undergraduate, Sanderson took a job as a [[night auditor]] at a local hotel in [[Provo, Utah]], as it allowed him to write while working.<ref name="About"/> One of Sanderson's roommates at BYU was [[Ken Jennings]], who nearly ten years later became famous during his 74-game win streak on the American game show ''[[Jeopardy!]]''.<ref name="ken jennings"/> Sanderson graduated with a [[B.A.]] in English in 2000, then continued on as a graduate student at BYU, receiving an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in English with an emphasis in [[creative writing]] in 2004.<ref name="masters"/> While at BYU, Sanderson was on the staff of ''[[Leading Edge (fiction magazine)|Leading Edge]]'', a semi-professional [[speculative fiction]] magazine published by the university, and served as its editor-in-chief for one year.

In 2006, Sanderson married Emily Bushman, a fellow English major and teacher,<ref name="July2006"/> who later became his business manager.<ref name="About"/> They have three sons and reside in [[American Fork, Utah]].<ref name="newsletter february 2010"/> They have a pet scarlet macaw called Magellan.

===Early writing career===
[[File:Brandon Sanderson with a German copy of Elantris.jpg|thumb|right|353px|Sanderson in 2007]]
Sanderson wrote consistently throughout his undergraduate and graduate studies, and by 2003 he had written twelve novels, though no publisher had accepted any of them for publication.<ref name="sanderson history as a writer"/> While in the middle of a graduate program at BYU, [[Tor Books]] editor Moshe Feder contacted him to say that he wanted to acquire one of his books. Sanderson had submitted the manuscript of his sixth novel,<ref name="elantris acquisition"/> ''[[Elantris]]'', a year and a half earlier.<ref name="About"/> ''Elantris'' was published by [[Tor Books]] on April 21, 2005, to generally positive reviews.<ref name="Elantris review by Orson Scott Card"/><ref name="Review blurbs on Sanderson's site"/> This was followed in 2006 by ''[[Mistborn: The Final Empire]]'', the first book in his [[Mistborn series|''Mistborn'']] fantasy trilogy, in which "allomancers"—people with the ability to 'burn' metals and alloys after ingesting them—gain enhanced senses and control over powerful supernatural forces.

He published the second book of the ''Mistborn'' series ''[[Mistborn: The Well of Ascension|The Well of Ascension]]'' in 2007. Later that year, Sanderson published the children's novel ''[[Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians]]'', about a boy named Alcatraz with a talent for breaking things. Alcatraz confronts a group of evil librarians who are bent on taking over the world. The first of his "[[Hard and soft magic systems#Sanderson's Laws of Magic|laws of magic]]" were first published in 2007, with the second and third published in 2012 and 2013 (respectively).<ref name="first law"/><ref name="second law"/><ref name="third law"/> In 2008, the third and final book in the Mistborn trilogy was published, titled ''[[Mistborn: The Hero of Ages|The Hero of Ages]]'', as well as the second book in the Alcatraz series, titled ''[[Alcatraz Versus the Scrivener's Bones]]''. That same year, he started the [[podcast]] ''[[Writing Excuses]]'' with [[Howard Tayler]] and [[Dan Wells (author)|Dan Wells]].<ref name="writing excuses about"/>

===Wheel of Time===
Sanderson became better known in late 2007 when [[Harriet McDougal]], the wife and editor of author [[Robert Jordan]], chose Sanderson to complete the final books in Jordan's epic fantasy series ''[[The Wheel of Time]]'' after Jordan's death. McDougal asked him to finish the series after being deeply impressed by his first ''[[Mistborn series|Mistborn]]'' novel, ''[[The Final Empire]]''.<ref name="dragonmount interview 2007"/> [[Tor Books]] made the announcement on December 7, 2007.<ref name="tor-jordan"/> After reviewing what was necessary to complete the series, Sanderson and Tor announced on March 30, 2009, that a final three books would be published instead of just one. The first of these, ''[[The Gathering Storm (novel)|The Gathering Storm]]'', was published on October 27, 2009, and reached the number-one spot on the ''New York Times'' bestseller list for hardcover fiction.<ref name="nytbest-gathering-storm"/><ref name="Sanders-Sooner"/> ''[[Towers of Midnight]]'', the second-to-last ''[[Wheel of Time]]'' book, was published just over a year after ''[[The Gathering Storm (novel)|The Gathering Storm]]'' on November 2, 2010, debuting at number one on the bestseller list.<ref name="nyt2010-11-21"/> In early 2013, the series was completed with the publication of ''[[A Memory of Light]]''.

===After the Wheel of Time===

In 2009, Tor Books published ''[[Warbreaker]]'', which originally appeared serially on Sanderson's website while he was writing the novel from 2006 to 2009. In the same year, the third ''Alcatraz'' book was published, titled ''[[Alcatraz Versus the Knights of Crystallia]]''. In 2010, Sanderson published ''[[The Way of Kings]],'' the first of a planned ten-book series called ''[[The Stormlight Archive]]''. It achieved the number seven slot on the ''New York Times'' hardcover fiction bestseller list.<ref name="way of kings 1"/> The fourth Alcatraz novel, ''[[Alcatraz Versus the Shattered Lens]]'', followed soon after.

In October 2011, he finished a novella e-book, ''[[Infinity Blade: Awakening]]'', based on the [[Action role-playing game|action role-playing]], [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] [[video game]] ''[[Infinity Blade]]'', developed by [[Chair Entertainment]] and [[Epic Games]].<ref name="infinity"/> In November 2011, he published a sequel to the ''Mistborn'' trilogy, ''[[Mistborn: The Alloy of Law]]''. It was originally planned as a standalone novel set about 300 years after the original trilogy, but it was later expanded into a four-book series. It debuted at number seven on the ''New York Times'' bestseller list.

On August 31, 2012, Sanderson published a science fiction novella entitled ''[[Legion (novella)|Legion]],'' followed by another short work titled ''[[The Emperor's Soul]]''. In 2013, Sanderson published two new young adult series.

Nine months later, Sanderson published ''[[Mistborn: Shadows of Self]]'' as a direct sequel to ''The Alloy of Law''. On November 16, 2015, Sanderson's agency (JABberwocky Literary Agency) announced that Sanderson officially sold over 7 million copies worldwide.<ref name="awful agent 7 million"/>

On January 26, 2016, ''[[Mistborn: The Bands of Mourning]]'' was published as the sequel to ''Shadows of Self''. On February 16, 2016, the third and final book of the [[Reckoners]] trilogy, titled ''[[The Reckoners#Calamity|Calamity]]'', was published.

The series is planned as a trilogy.<ref name="white sands"/> The graphic novels are based on an original manuscript by Sanderson.<ref name="white sands - may 2014"/> On September 6, 2016, the fifth ''Alcatraz'' book was published, called ''[[Alcatraz Versus the Dark Talent]]''.

On November 22, 2016, an anthology of Cosmere short stories and novellas was published, titled ''[[Arcanum Unbounded: A Cosmere Collection]]''.

In March 2021, Brandon Sanderson announced a "Weekly Update" in his Youtube channel which will give updates on his current projects every week. On May 26, Brandon Sanderson revealed the title and cover for "Cytonic", the third book of his Skyward series, which was published on November 23, 2021.

In June 2021, Sanderson started a new podcast called 'Intentionally Blank', with friend and fellow science fiction author [[Dan Wells (author)|Dan Wells]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSH_xM-KC3Zv3L2dLcX3WmtbQsfB8YSSw|title=Intentionally Blank Podcast - Brandon Sanderson on Youtube|website=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>

==Cosmere==
The cosmere is the name of the universe in which ''[[Elantris]]'', ''[[Mistborn]]'', ''[[Warbreaker]]'', ''[[The Stormlight Archive]]'', ''[[White Sand (graphic novel)|White Sand]]'', and stories contained in ''[[Arcanum Unbounded: The Cosmere Collection]]'' are all set. This idea came from Sanderson's desire to create an epic-length series without requiring readers to buy a ridiculous number of books. Because of that, he hides connections to his other works within each book, creating a "hidden epic".<ref>{{cite web|first=Brandon|last=Sanderson|title=How/When Did You Come Up With The Idea Of The Cosmere?|url=https://faq.brandonsanderson.com/knowledge-base/how-when-did-you-come-up-with-the-idea-of-the-cosmere/|access-date=September 23, 2020|website=brandonsanderson.com|date=October 20, 2018}}</ref> He has estimated that the cosmere sequence could conclude with at least 40 books.<ref name="reddit state of the sanderson 2016"/>

The story of the cosmere is about a mysterious being called Adonalsium, who existed on a world known as Yolen. Adonalsium was killed by a group of sixteen conspirators, causing its power to shatter into sixteen different Shards, each of which bears immense power.<ref name="Adonalsium"/> The sixteen people then took these Shards and traveled to new worlds, populating them with different [[Magic system|systems of magic]]. In one case, the Shards ''Ruin'' and ''Preservation'' worked together to actually create a planet and its people (Scadrial, as featured in ''[[Mistborn]]'').

Each Shard has an Intent, such as ''Ambition'' or ''Honor'', and a Vessel's personality is changed over time to bring them more in-line with their Intent. ''Odium'' has killed{{mdash}}or Splintered{{mdash}}several shards. On Sel, he splintered ''Devotion'' and ''Dominion'', accidentally creating the Dor, from which Seons and Skaze have emerged. On Roshar, ''Odium'' splintered ''Honor'', and brought about the Everstorm and the True Desolation. He has also Splintered ''Ambition'', in the Threnody system. A man named Hoid is seen or mentioned in most Cosmere books. He travels the so-called Shardworlds, using the people of those worlds to further an unknown agenda.<ref name="thewertzone 2012"/>

Sanderson's three laws of magic are creative writing guidelines that can be used to create magic systems for fantasy stories.
