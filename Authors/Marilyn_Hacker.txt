== Early life and education ==
Hacker was born and raised in [[Bronx]], [[New York (state)|New York]], the only child of Jewish immigrant parents. Her father was a management consultant and her mother a teacher.<ref name="gale">{{cite web |website=Encyclopedia.com |title=Hacker, Marilyn 1942- |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/educational-magazines/hacker-marilyn-1942 |publisher=Gale |date=2009}}</ref> Hacker attended the [[Bronx High School of Science]], where she met her future husband [[Samuel R. Delany]], who would become a well-known [[science-fiction]] writer. She enrolled at [[New York University]] at the age of fifteen (B.A., 1964). Three years later, Hacker and Delany traveled from New York to [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]] and were married. In ''The Motion of Light in Water'', Delany said they married in Detroit because of age-of-consent laws and because he was African-American and she was Caucasian: "there were only two states in the union where we could legally wed. The closest one was Michigan."<ref name="delany">{{cite book |last = Delany

== Career ==

Hacker's first publication was in [[Cornell University]]'s ''Epoch''.<ref name="campo">{{cite web |last1=Campo |first1=Rafael |author-link=Rafael Campo (poet) |website=Ploughshares |title=About Marilyn Hacker: A Profile |url=https://www.pshares.org/issues/spring-1996/about-marilyn-hacker-profile}}</ref> After moving to London in 1970, she found an audience through the pages of ''[[The London Magazine]]'' and ''[[Ambit (magazine)|Ambit]]''.<ref name="pa" /> She and her husband edited the magazine ''Quark: A Quarterly of Speculative Fiction'' (4 issues; 1970–71). <!--She also performed in a series of U.S. State Department-sponsored readings at British universities with the influential rock band [[Eggs Over Easy]].--> Early recognition came for her when [[Richard Howard]], then editor of the ''[[New American Review]]'', accepted three of Hacker's poems for publication.<ref name="pa" />

In 1974, when she was thirty-one, ''Presentation Piece'' was published by The Viking Press. The book was a [[Lamont Poetry Selection]] of the Academy of American Poets and won the annual [[National Book Award for Poetry]].<ref name=nba1975/> ''Winter Numbers'', which details the loss of many of her friends to [[AIDS]] and her own struggle with [[breast cancer]], garnered a [[Lambda Literary Award]] and ''[[The Nation]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize]].<ref name="campo" />  Her ''Selected Poems 1965-1990'' received the 1996 [[Poets' Prize]], and ''Squares and Courtyards'' won the 2001 [[Audre Lorde Award]].<ref name="gale" /> She received an Award in Literature from the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] in 2004.<ref name="pa" />

Hacker often employs strict poetic forms in her poetry: for example, in ''Love, Death, and the Changing of the Seasons'', which is a [[verse novel]] in [[sonnet]]s. She is also recognized as a master of "French forms" such as the [[Rondeau (forme fixe)|rondeau]] and [[villanelle]].<ref name="exalt">{{cite book |last1=Finch |first1=Annie |author-link=Annie Finch |last2=Varnes |first2=Kathrine |title=An Exaltation of Forms: Contemporary Poets Celebrate the Diversity of Their Art |publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]] |date=2002 |isbn=9780472067251 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/exaltationofform00finc/page/288 288]–289 |url=https://archive.org/details/exaltationofform00finc|url-access=registration }}</ref>

In 1990 she became the first full-time editor of the [[Kenyon Review]], a position she held until 1994. She was noted for "broaden[ing] the quarterly's scope to include more minority and marginalized viewpoints."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kenyonreview.org/about/history/ |title=A Brief History of the Kenyon Review |publisher=The Kenyon Review |access-date=2013-08-15}}</ref>

Hacker lives in New York and Paris and has retired from teaching at the [[City College of New York]] and the [[CUNY Graduate Center]].<ref name="gale" />

Though not a character, a poem of Hacker's is reprinted in ''[[Heavenly Breakfast]],'' Delany's memoir of a [[Greenwich Village]] commune in 1967; in Delany's autobiography, ''[[The Motion of Light in Water]]'';<ref name="delany" /> and her prose and incidents about her appear in his journals, ''The Journals of Samuel R. Delany: In Search of Silence'', Volume 1, 1957–1969, edited by Kenneth R. James (Wesleyan University Press, 2017).

Hacker was a judge for the 2012 [[Hippocrates Prize for Poetry and Medicine]]. In 2013, she was inducted into the [[New York Writers Hall of Fame]]. In 2014, she published a collaboration with a Palestinian-American poet, [[Deema Shehabi]], written in the style of a Japanese [[renga]], a form of alternating call and answer. The book, ''Diaspo/renga: a collaboration in alternating renga'' explores the emotional journey of living in exile.<ref name="Diaspo/Renga">{{cite web|title=Diaspo/Renga|url=http://hollandparkpress.co.uk/book_detail.php?book_id=40|website=Holland Park Press|publisher=Holland Park Press|access-date=19 April 2015|location=London}}</ref>

Juster]] states that "there is no poet writing in English with a better claim for the Nobel Prize in Literature than Marilyn Hacker."<ref name="larb">{{cite web |last1=Juster |first1=A.
