'''Ernst Toller''' (1 December 1893 – 22 May 1939) was a [[German people|German]] author, playwright, left-wing politician and revolutionary, known for his [[Expressionism (theatre)|Expressionist]] plays. He served in 1919 for six days as President of the short-lived [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]], after which he became the head of its army. He was imprisoned for five years for his part in the armed resistance by the Bavarian Soviet Republic to the central government in [[Berlin]]. While in prison Toller wrote several plays that gained him international renown. They were performed in [[London]] and [[New York City|New York]] as well as in [[Berlin]].

In 1933 Toller was exiled from Germany after the [[Nazis]] came to power. He did a lecture tour in 1936&ndash;1937 in the United States and Canada, settling in California for a while before going to New York. He joined other exiles there. He committed [[suicide]] in May 1939.

In 2000, several of his plays were published in an English translation.

== Life and career ==
Toller was born in 1893 into a [[Jewish]] family in [[Szamocin|Samotschin]], Germany (now [[Szamocin]], Poland). He was the son of Ida (Kohn) and Max Toller, a pharmacist. His parents ran a general store.<ref name="ossarp2">{{Cite book |last=Ossar |first=M. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jAr6iCh4_HAC&pg=PA2 |title=Anarchism in the Dramas of Ernst Toller: The Realm of Necessity and the Realm of Freedom |last2=Paul Avrich Collection ([[Library of Congress]]) |publisher=State University of New York Press |year=1980 |isbn=978-0-87395-393-1 |page=2 |access-date=6 September 2020}}</ref> He had a sister and brother. They grew up speaking Yiddish and German, and he later became fluent in English.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}

At the outbreak of [[World War I]], he volunteered for the German Army. After serving for 13 months on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]],<ref name="Britannica">{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Ernst Toller |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/598659/Ernst-Toller |access-date=17 Feb 2012}}</ref> he suffered a complete physical and psychological collapse. His first drama, ''Transformation'' (''Die Wandlung'', 1919), was wrought from his wartime experiences.

Together with leading [[anarchists]], such as [[B. Traven]] and [[Gustav Landauer]], and Toller's party, the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (USPD), Toller was involved in the short-lived 1919 [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]]. The communists are against the founding of a communist republic at this point.<ref>Volker Weidermann, Dreamers, p.141</ref> He served as president from 6 April to 12 April.<ref name=Britannica/> Communists agitated against Toller and his councils and sent speakers into soldiers barracks to announce that the Council Republic did not deserve to be defended.<ref>Volker Weidermann, Dreamers, p. 150</ref> He issued numerous decrees, the press was socialised, the mining industry was socialised, and the eight-hour working day made legally binding. He decreed that citizens could withdraw only 100 marks per day from the banks, and issued reassurance to the workers that these measures were directed against the major capitalists who were attempting to take money abroad. A decree was made against exorbitant rents.<ref>Volker Weidermann, Dreamers, p. 152</ref>  His government members were not always well-chosen. For instance, the Foreign Affairs Deputy Dr. [[Franz Lipp]] (who had been admitted several times to psychiatric hospitals) informed [[Vladimir Lenin]] via cable that the ousted former Minister-President, [[Johannes Hoffmann (SPD)|Johannes Hoffmann]], had fled to [[Bamberg]] and taken the key to the ministry toilet with him.  On Palm Sunday, April 1919, the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] seized power, with [[Eugen Leviné]] as their leader.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Jeffrey S.

The noted authors [[Max Weber]] and [[Thomas Mann]] testified on Toller's behalf when he was tried for his part in the revolution. He was sentenced to five years in prison and served his sentence in the prisons of [[Stadelheim Prison|Stadelheim]], Neuburg, [[Eichstätt]]. From February 1920 until his release, he was in the fortress of [[Niederschönenfeld]], where he spent 149 days in [[solitary confinement]] and 24 days on [[hunger strike]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Dove |first=Richard |url=https://archive.org/details/hewasgermanbiogr0000dove |title=He Was a German: A Biography of Ernst Toller |publisher=Libris |year=1990 |isbn=1870352858 |location=London |url-access=registration}}</ref>

His time in prison was productive; he completed work on ''Transformation'', which premiered in Berlin under the direction of [[Karlheinz Martin]] in September 1919. At the time of this work's 100th performance, the Bavarian government offered Toller a pardon. He refused it out of solidarity with other [[political prisoner]]s. Toller continued writing in prison, completing some of what would be his most celebrated works, including the dramas ''Masses Man'' (''Masse Mensch''), ''The Machine Breakers'' (''Die Maschinenstürmer''), ''Hinkemann, the German'' (''Der Deutsche Hinkemann''), and many poems. These works established him as an important German expressionist playwright, and they used symbols derived from the First World War and its aftermath in his society.{{citation needed|date=September 2020}}

Not until after his release from prison in July 1925 was Toller able to see any of his plays performed. In 1925, the most famous of his later dramas, ''[[Hoppla, We're Alive!]]'' (''Hoppla, wir Leben!''), directed by [[Erwin Piscator]], premiered in Berlin. It tells of a  revolutionary discharged from a mental hospital after eight years, who discovers that his former comrades have grown complacent and compromised within the system they once opposed. In despair, he kills himself.<ref>Pearlman, Alan Raphael, ed. and trans. 2000. ''Plays One: Transformation, Masses Man, Hoppla, We're Alive!.'' By Ernst Toller. Absolute Classics series.

==Exile, death and legacy ==
In 1933, after the [[Nazi]] rise to power, Toller was exiled from Germany because of his work; the Nazis did not like [[modernist]] arts of any form. His citizenship was nullified by the Nazi government later that year. He travelled to London with 16-year-old [[Christiane Grautoff]]; they married in London in 1935, the same year he participated as co-director in the Manchester production of his play ''Rake Out the Fires'' (''Feuer aus den Kesseln'').{{citation needed|date=September 2020}}

In 1936 and 1937, Toller went on a lecture tour of the United States and Canada, settling in [[California]]. Fluent in English, he wrote screenplays but could not get them produced. In 1936 he moved to New York City, where he joined a group of artists and writers in exile, including [[Klaus Mann]], [[Erika Mann]] (at one time married to the poet [[W.H. Auden]], who was also in the US), and [[Therese Giehse]]. He earned some money from journalism.{{citation needed|date=September 2020}}

Two of his early plays were produced in New York in this period: ''The Machine Wreckers'' (1922), whose opening night in 1937 he attended, and ''No More Peace'', produced in 1937 by the [[Federal Theatre Project]] and presented in New York City in 1938. Their sense of immediacy was gone: the first play was related to the First World War and its aftermath, and the second an earlier period of the rise of the Nazis. Their style was outmoded for New York, and the poor reception added to Toller's discouragement.<ref name="bauland">[https://books.google.com/books?id=wb_JWr4XSdsC&pg=PA112&lpg=PA112&dq=Bloody+Laughter+by+Toller&source=bl&ots=fz99o2nQiD&sig=2AcLYtR2W33cz9FpevOBeR2LmvM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=YlgzUrPEB4aLqQHQyYDAAg&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Bloody%20Laughter%20by%20Toller&f=false Peter Bauland, ''The Hooded Eagle: Modern German Drama on the New York Stage''], Syracuse University Press, 1968, pp. 112-114</ref>

Suffering from [[depression (mood)|depression]], separated from his wife and struggling with financial woes (he had given all his money to [[Spanish Civil War]] refugees), Toller committed [[suicide]] on 22 May 1939.<ref name="ossarp8">{{Cite book |last=Ossar |first=M. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jAr6iCh4_HAC&pg=PA2 |title=Anarchism in the Dramas of Ernst Toller: The Realm of Necessity and the Realm of Freedom |last2=Paul Avrich Collection ([[Library of Congress]]) |publisher=State University of New York Press |year=1980 |isbn=978-0-87395-393-1 |page=8 |access-date=6 September 2020}}</ref> He hanged himself in his room<ref name=Britannica /> at the [[Mayflower Hotel (New York)|Mayflower Hotel]],<ref>{{Cite web |last=Fisher |first=Oscar |date=August 1939 |title=The Suicide of Ernst Toller |url=http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/ni/vol05/no08/fischer.htm |access-date=22 April 2009 |website=New International, Vol. 5, No. 8}}</ref> after laying out on his hotel desk "photos of Spanish children who had been killed by fascist bombs".<ref>Jean-Michel Palmier, Weimar in Exile, pg 360</ref>

The English author [[Robert Payne (author)|Robert Payne]], who knew Toller in Spain and in Paris, later wrote in his diary that Toller had said shortly before his death:<ref>Robert Payne, "Diary entry for May 23, 1942", ''Forever China'' (Chungking Diaries), New York: Dodd, Mead, 1945</ref><blockquote> "If ever you read that I committed suicide, I beg you not to believe it."  Payne continued: "He hanged himself with the silk cord of his nightgown in a hotel in New York two years ago. This is what the newspapers said at the time, but I continue to believe that he was murdered".</blockquote>

[[W. H. Auden]]'s poem "In Memory of Ernst Toller" was published in ''[[Another Time (book)|Another Time]]'' (1940).
