'''Susanna Gregory''' is the pseudonym of Elizabeth Cruwys, a [[Cambridge]] academic who was previously a coroner's officer. She writes [[detective fiction]], and is noted for her series of [[historical mystery|mediaeval mysteries]] featuring Matthew Bartholomew, a teacher of medicine and investigator of murders in 14th-century Cambridge.

== Works==
Her books may have some aspects in common with the [[Ellis Peters]] ''[[The Cadfael Chronicles|Cadfael]]'' series, the mediaeval adventures of two men, a highly intelligent physician and a Benedictine monk who is senior proctor of [[Cambridge University]]. Matthew Bartholomew's activities as a healer, including examination of corpses, embroil him in a series of  mysterious crimes, both secular and monastic, and he reluctantly assumes the role of an amateur sleuth. Skeptical of superstition, he is somewhat ahead of his time, and much accurate historical detail is woven into the adventures. But there any resemblance to the comparatively warm-hearted Cadfael series ends: the tone and subject matter of the Gregory novels is far darker and does not shrink from portraying the harsh realities of life in the [[Middle Ages]]. The first in the series, ''A Plague on Both Your Houses'' (1996) is set against the ravages of the [[Black Death]] and subsequent novels take much of their subject matter from the attempts of society to recover from this disaster.

These novels bear the marks of much detailed research into medieval conditions - many of the supporting characters have names taken from the documentation of the time, referenced at the end of each book - and bring vividly to life the all-pervading squalor of living conditions in England during the Middle Ages. The deep-rooted and pervasive practice of traditional leechcraft as it contrasts with the dawning science of [[evidence-based medicine]] is a common bone of contention between Matthew and the students he teaches at Michaelhouse College (now part of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]), whilst the conflict between the students of [[Cambridge]] and the townsfolk continually threatens to escalate into violence.

Another series of books, set just after the Restoration of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], features Thomas Chaloner, detective and former spy. This series began with ''A Conspiracy of Violence'' published in January 2006.

Gregory's short story "To Dispose of an Abbot" was published in the 1998 anthology ''[[Past Poisons|Past Poisons: An Ellis Peters Memorial Anthology of Historical Crime]]''.
