==Biography==

Adam Dalton was born in [[Croydon, England]] on a dark and stormy night{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}. He was educated at [[Whitgift School]] and the [[University of Warwick]], where he completed a BA in English and American Literature and an MA in English Literature.<ref>{{cite web|title=A J Dalton Profile|url=http://metaphysicalfantasy.wordpress.com/a-j-dalton-2/a-j-dalton/}}</ref>

Dalton moved into English language teaching, working in a variety of countries between 1996 and 2005. He then took a managerial position in [[Manchester, England]], with the British Council, the UK's international organisation for cultural relations, a registered charity. While working there, he self-published the Flesh & Bone series: ''Necromancer's Gambit'' (2008), ''Necromancer's Betrayal'' (2009), and ''Necromancer's Fall'' (2010)''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gollancz - Exclusive Interview with AJ Dalton |url=http://www.gollancz.co.uk/2012/05/exclusive-interview-with-aj-dalton/ |access-date=13 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703105336/https://www.gollancz.co.uk/2012/05/exclusive-interview-with-aj-dalton/ |archive-date=3 July 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  ''In late 2011, he signed a deal with Gollancz for ''Empire of the Saviours'' and a further two volumes, namely ''Gateway of the Saviours'' and ''Tithe of the Saviours''. In 2015, he published ''The Book of Orm'' with Kristell Ink, a collection of fantasy stories based on Scandinavian mythology. He followed that collection with ''The Book of Angels'' in 2016 and'' The Book of Dragons'' in 2017.

Dalton's academic study of fantasy and its subgenres was completed in 2018, when he completed a PhD with the [[University of Huddersfield]]. That academic work, his earlier publications and website (2008) have seen him recognised as the creator and lead author of the fantasy sub-genre known as 'metaphysical fantasy'{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}.
