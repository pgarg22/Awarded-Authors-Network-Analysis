He is principally known for his role as lyricist, [[performance poet]] and lead vocalist of the [[space rock]] band [[Hawkwind]].<ref name="ankeny">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/robert-calvert-mn0000233637/biography |title= Artist Biography by Jason Ankeny |website=[[AllMusic]] |first=Jason |last=Ankeny |access-date=14 July 2019}}</ref>

==Early life==
Calvert was born in [[Pretoria]], South Africa, and moved with his parents to England when he was two.<ref name="LarkinGE">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1992|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-939-0|page=396/7}}</ref> He attended school in London and [[Margate]]. Having finished school he joined the [[Air Training Corps]], in which he became a corporal and played [[trumpet]] for the 438 Squadron band.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spirit-of-metal.com/membre_groupe/membre_groupe-nom-Robert_Calvert-id-14818-l-en.html |title=Robert Calvert (Hawkwind)- Musician Profile |website=Spirit-of-metal.com |access-date=2014-07-18}}</ref> He then went on to college in [[Canterbury]]. After leaving college, and having been denied his childhood dream of becoming a [[fighter pilot]], he slowly acquainted himself with the UK's bohemian scene. Calvert began his career in earnest by writing poetry.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Robert Calvert|url=https://moviefit.me/persons/1260265-robert-calvert|access-date=2021-11-29|website=Moviefit|language=en}}</ref>

==Career==
In 1967 he formed the [[street theatre]] group  'Street Dada Nihilismus'.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Bailes|first=Kathy|date=2018-05-11|title=Hawkwind and why their Dreamland gig is a homecoming (of sorts)|url=https://theisleofthanetnews.com/2018/05/11/hawkwind-and-why-their-dreamland-gig-is-a-homecoming-of-sorts/|access-date=2021-11-29|website=The Isle Of Thanet News|language=en-GB}}</ref>

At the end of the 1960s, he returned to London and joined the city's flourishing [[psychedelic subculture]]. He soon became one of its most active members; joining, amongst other activities, ''[[Frendz]]'', one of the leading [[underground magazine]]s of the time. During that time he acquainted himself with [[New Wave science fiction]] writers. Acclaimed author [[Michael Moorcock]], winner of several science fiction literary awards and publisher of the influential ''[[New Worlds (magazine)|New Worlds]]'' magazine, became a lifelong friend. Calvert's poems were published in ''New Worlds'' and other magazines. Although he was influenced by the New Wave, Calvert developed a distinct style of his own. His ability to change fluently between poetry, music and theatre allowed him to develop into a [[multimedia artist]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Banks|first=Joe|date=2021-08-13|title=Robert Calvert: the genius who played with fire|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/robert-calvert-the-genius-who-played-with-fire|access-date=2021-11-29|website=loudersound|language=en}}</ref>

===Hawkwind===
After becoming acquainted with [[Dave Brock]], Calvert joined [[Hawkwind]] as a lyricist, performance poet and occasional lead vocalist in 1971.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Following a two-year absence, he rejoined as the band's principal lead vocalist in 1975 before leaving once again in 1979. Calvert co-wrote Hawkwind's hit single "[[Silver Machine]]", which reached No. 3 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Although [[Lemmy]] sings on the single version, this is an overdub of a live recording taken at the Roundhouse in London with Calvert on vocals.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> "They tried everyone else singing it except me", Lemmy later said.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Saga of Hawkwind|first= Carol|last= Clerk|year= 2004|publisher= Omnibus Press| ISBN=1-84449-101-3}}</ref> Calvert also directed the ''[[Space Ritual]]'' tour, which is widely perceived as the band's artistic zenith.

During periods away from Hawkwind duties, Calvert worked on his solo career; his solo creative output included albums, stage plays, poetry, and a novel. His first solo album, ''[[Captain Lockheed and the Starfighters]]'', was released in 1974.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> The record is a concept album, an amalgam of music and theatre focused around the [[Lockheed bribery scandals]]. In 1975, he won the [[Capital Radio]] poetry competition with his poem "Circle Line". In 1975, musician and producer [[Brian Eno]] produced and played on Calvert's second solo album, ''[[Lucky Leif and the Longships]]'',<ref name="LarkinGE"/> a [[concept album]] which looked at the history of the US and the [[Norse colonization of the Americas|Vikings, who crossed the Atlantic to reach America before Columbus]]. In 1977, Hawkwind performed "[[Quark, Strangeness and Charm]]" on [[Marc Bolan]]'s TV series, ''[[Marc (TV series)|Marc]]''.

As well as Michael Moorcock and Brian Eno, Calvert's collaborators included [[Arthur Brown (musician)|Arthur Brown]], [[Steve Peregrin Took]], [[Jim Capaldi]], [[Steve Pond]], [[Inner City Unit]], [[Vivian Stanshall]], [[Nektar]], [[John Greaves (musician)|John Greaves]], Adrian Wagner, [[Amon Düül II]] and, posthumously, [[Spirits Burning]], [[Dave Brock]], and Krankschaft.

Calvert suffered from [[bipolar disorder]], which often caused a fractious relationship with his fellow musicians. At one point he was [[sectioned]] under the [[Mental Health Act]]. Despite his sometimes debilitating mental health, he remained a fiercely creative, driven and multi-talented artist.<ref name=":0" />

==Personal life==
In 1966, according to the Sussex History Forum, he married Paulyn J.Morrell, in Thanet.

==Death==
Aged 43, Calvert died of a heart attack in 1988 in [[Ramsgate]], England,<ref name="LarkinGE"/><ref name="Dead"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Robert Calvert - a biography |url=http://www.aural-innovations.com/robertcalvert/calvertbio/calvertbio.htm |publisher=Aural Innovations |access-date=31 May 2015}}</ref> and was buried in Minster Cemetery at [[Minster-in-Thanet]]. His gravestone is engraved with the line "Love's not Time's fool", from [[William Shakespeare]]'s [[Sonnet 116]]. One of his three children, Daren, (1967–85), is buried with him, and is described on the gravestone as an "Adventurer".
