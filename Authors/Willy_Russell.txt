On leaving school, aged 15, he became a ladies' hairdresser, eventually running his own salon, until the age of 20 when he decided to go back to college. This led to his qualifying as a teacher.

Russell (with musical collaborator Bob Eaton) realised a long-held ambition to develop ''[[Our Day Out]]'' further and after extensive rewriting, and recomposing created ''[[Our Day Out (musical)|Our Day Out – The Musical]]''. This modern musical retelling retains all the characters and plot of the original but with the action brought forward to today with a new score and lyrics to reflect this twenty first century setting. The musical was produced in 2010 at the [[Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool]].<ref>Roberts, John.
