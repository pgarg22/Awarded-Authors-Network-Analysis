'''Walter Kennedy''' (ca. 1455 – c.1508), younger brother of John Kennedy, 2nd Lord Kennedy of [[Dunure]]. [[Clan Kennedy]]. He was '''parson of Douglas''' who acquired Glentig in 1504 from John Wallace, and married Christian Hynd.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Book of Wallace |first=Charles |last=Rogers |publisher=Grampian Club |location=Edinburgh |volume=1 |date=1889 |page=154 |url=https://archive.org/stream/bookwallace00clubgoog#page/n179/mode/1up}}</ref>

Kennedy was born into the Scottish [[Clan Kennedy]], a principal aristocratic family in [[Dunure]], [[South Ayrshire]]. This was part of the [[Galloway]] [[Gàidhealtachd]], a strong [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]]-speaking area of the Scottish Lowlands. He was almost certain to have been a native speaker of the language.<ref name=meixv>{{harvnb|Meier|2008|p=xv}}</ref> Educated at the [[University of Glasgow]], he graduated in 1476, then obtained an [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|MA]] in 1478.<ref name=meixv/>

As great-grandson of [[Robert III of Scotland|Robert III]]<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tasioulas |first1=Jacqueline |title=The Makars: The Poems of Henryson, Dunbar, and Douglas |date=1999 |publisher=Canongate Books |location=Edinburgh |isbn=978-0862418205 |page=789}}</ref> and nephew of [[James Kennedy (bishop)|James Kennedy]], [[bishop of St Andrews]],<ref name=meixv/> Kennedy would have been very well-connected in the royal court. He possessed estates in both [[Carrick, Scotland|Carrick]] and [[Galloway]] and is known to have held ecclesiastical posts such as [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of [[Douglas, South Lanarkshire|Douglas]] and [[Canon (priest)|canon]] of [[Glasgow Cathedral]] although records show that his right to hold at least one of his posts was contested by the [[Holy See]] in Rome.{{sfn|Meier|2008|p=xvii}}

==Poems of Walter Kennedy==

Walter was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[makar]] associated with the renaissance court of [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]], perhaps best known as the defendant against [[William Dunbar]] in ''[[The Flyting of Dumbar and Kennedie]]'', but his surviving works clearly show him to have been an accomplished "master" in many genres.{{sfn|Meier|2008|p=ix}} It is likely that a significant body of poetry by him has been lost.

His most impressive surviving poem is ''[[The Passioun]]''.

Although Kennedy's surviving works are written in [[Middle Scots]] he may also have composed in [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]]. In the ''Flyting'', for instance, Dunbar makes big play of Kennedy's [[Carrick, Scotland|Carrick]] roots (albeit in the rankly insulting terms that are part of the genre) and strongly associates him with ''Erschry'', which meant in other words the [[bard]]ic tradition. By this time, the term ''[[Goidelic languages|Irish]]'' in Scotland signified Gaelic generally:

:Sic eloquence as thay in Erschry use,
:In sic is sett thy thraward appetyte.
:Thow hes full littill feill of fair indyte.
:I tak on me, ane pair of Lowthiane hippis
:Sall fairar [[Northumbrian language|Inglis]] mak and mair perfyte
:Than thow can blabbar with thy Carrik lippis.

:''Such eloquence as they in Irishry [Gaeldom] use''
:''Is what defines your perverse taste.''
:''You have very small aptitude for good verse-making.''
:''I'll wager, a pair of [[Lothian]] hips''
:''Shall fairer English [Lowland Scots] make and more polished''
:''Than thou can blabber with thy [[Carrick, Scotland|Carrick]] lips.''

Kennedy also appears at the end of Dunbar's ''[[Lament for the Makaris]]'' (c.1505) where he is described as being close to death (''in poynt of dede'') though there is no evidence that he died at this date.{{sfn|Meier|2008|p=xvii}}{{efn|Meier posits the possibility that Kennedy may have lived until 1518, the year in which one of his sons is on record as succeeding to some of his estates.{{harvnb|Meier|2008|p=xvii}}}}

Only six works by Walter Kennedy are extant, including his contribution to the ''Flyting'', but taken together these amount to a not insignificant 2443 lines of verse. Kennedy's longest poem is ''The Passioun of Crist'', a courtly and successful depiction of the story of [[Christ]] from the [[Nativity of Jesus|nativity]] to the [[Ascension of Jesus|ascension]] and a significant yet neglected work altogether different in form, register and subject from the ''Flyting'', his second longest work.<ref name=meixv/>

There are four other works, all much shorter but still highly various in genre:

*''An aigit man, twys {{sic|fou|rty|hide=y}} yeiris''
*''At Matyne hour, in myddis of the nycht''
*''Ane Ballat of Our Lady''
*''Leif luve, my luve, na langar it lyk''

Walter Kennedy was an acclaimed poet in his lifetime. Both [[Gavin Douglas]] and Sir [[David Lyndsay]] paid tribute to him as a fellow makar in their works.

==Influence==
The twentieth-century poet [[William Neill (poet)|William Neill]], interested in Kennedy's [[South Ayrshire]] roots and his possible role as a Gaelic speaker in the Scottish court, has incorporated tributes to the makar into his own writing. One example is the Gaelic poem ''[[Chuma Bhaltair Cinneide]]'' (''In Memory of Walter Kennedy'')<ref>{{cite book |last1=Neill |first1=William |author1-link=William Neill (poet) |title=Selected poems, 1969-1992 |date=1994 |publisher=Canongate Press |location=Edinburgh |isbn=9780862414764 |pages=80–81}} The translation is by the poet.</ref> which opens:

{{cquote|

''I saw Walter Kennedy''<br>
''walking through the apple of my eye''<br>
''under the shadow of the Black Vault,''<br>
''at the time of sunset,''<br>
''and the gravel under his feet''<br>
''on the grey beach of [[Dunure]]...''}}
