'''Christopher Fry''' (18 December 1907 – 30 June 2005) was an English [[poet]] and [[playwright]]. He is best known for his verse dramas, especially ''[[The Lady's Not for Burning]]'', which made him a major force in theatre in the 1940s and 1950s.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Fry was born as '''Arthur Hammond Harris''' in [[Bristol]], the son of Charles John Harris, a master builder who retired early to work full-time as a licensed [[Lay Reader]] in the [[Church of England]], and his wife Emma Marguerite Fry Hammond Harris.<ref name=nyt>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/05/theater/05fry.html |title=Christopher Fry, British Playwright in Verse, Dies at 97 |last=Nightingale |first=Benedict |work=The New York Times |date=5 July 2005 |access-date=10 June 2013}}</ref> While still young, he took his mother's maiden name because, on very tenuous grounds, he believed her to be related to the 19th-century [[Quaker]] prison reformer [[Elizabeth Fry]].<ref name=nyt /><ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article540139.ece The Times obituary]</ref> He adopted Elizabeth Fry's faith, and became a Quaker.

After attending [[Bedford Modern School]], where he wrote amateur plays,<ref name=nyt /> he became a schoolteacher, working at the Bedford [[Friedrich Fröbel|Froebel]] Kindergarten and [[Hazelwood School]] in [[Limpsfield]], [[Surrey]].

In the 1920s, he met the writer [[Robert Gittings]], who became a lifelong friend.<ref>Tolley, G., ''Gittings, Robert William Victor (1911–1992)'' in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|ODNB]]'' [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/51049 online] (subscription required), accessed 10 August 2008</ref>

===Career===
Fry gave up his school career in 1932 to found the [[Tunbridge Wells]] Repertory Players, which he ran for three years, directing and starring in the English premiere of [[George Bernard Shaw]]’s ''[[A Village Wooing]]'' in 1934. As a curtain-raiser, he put on a revised version of a show he wrote when he was a schoolboy called ''The Peregrines''. He also wrote the music for ''[[She Shall Have Music]]'' in 1935.

His play about Dr. [[Thomas John Barnardo]], the founder of children's homes, toured in a fund-raising amateur production in 1935 and 1936, including [[Deborah Kerr]] in its cast.

His professional career began to take off when he was commissioned by the vicar of [[Steyning]], [[West Sussex]], to write a play celebrating the local saint, [[Cuthman of Steyning]], which became ''The Boy With A Cart'' in 1938. It would be put on professionally in 1950 with the young [[Richard Burton]] in his first starring role.

[[Tewkesbury Abbey]] commissioned his next play, ''The Tower'', written in 1939, which was seen by the poet [[T. S. Eliot]], who became a friend and is often cited as an influence.<ref name=nyt/> In 1939 Fry also became artistic director of [[Oxford Playhouse]].

A [[pacifist]], he was a [[conscientious objector]] during [[World War II]], and served in the [[Non-Combatant Corps]]; for part of the time he cleaned London's sewers.<ref name=nyt/>

After the War, he wrote a comedy, ''[[A Phoenix Too Frequent]]'', which was produced at the [[Mercury Theatre, Notting Hill Gate]],and revived at the [[Arts Theatre]] London, in 1946, starring [[Paul Scofield]], [[Hermione Hannen]], and [[Joan White]]. The show is a comedy that is based upon [[Petronius]]'s tale of the [[Ephesus|Ephesian]] widow, the false heroics of [[Dynamene]]'s mourning of her husband in his tomb, and her reawakening to the joy of life by a handsome officer who enters the tomb to rest on a course of duty.

''The Firstborn'' was produced at the Oxford Playhouse in 1948. The plot is that of Egypt in the throes of a threatening conflict between master and slave, with [[Moses]] denouncing his privileges as an Egyptian-reared soldier and finding new responsibility as a leader of his people.  The play was produced by actress [[Katharine Cornell]] and featured two songs specially written for the play by [[Leonard Bernstein]].

In 1948 he wrote a commission for the [[Canterbury]] Festival, ''Thor, With Angels''.

===Major works===
Fry was then commissioned to write a play by [[Alec Clunes]], manager of the [[Arts Theatre]] in London. The result, ''[[The Lady's Not for Burning]]'', was first performed there in 1948, directed by the actor [[Jack Hawkins]]. Due to its success, it transferred to the West End for a nine-month run, starring [[John Gielgud]] and featuring [[Richard Burton]] and [[Claire Bloom]] among the cast. It was presented on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1950, again with Burton. The play marked a revival in popularity for poetic drama, most notably espoused by [[T. S. Eliot|T.S. Eliot]]. It is the most performed of all his plays and inspired British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] to declaim, "You turn if you want to — the lady’s not for turning," at the Conservative Party conference in 1980.<ref>Mrs Thatcher quotation in The Penguin Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Quotations, edited by JM and MJ Cohen, (Viking, 1993)</ref>

In 1950, Fry adapted a translation of [[Jean Anouilh]]’s ''[[Invitation to the Castle]]'' as ''[[Ring Round the Moon]]'' for director [[Peter Brook]]. He also wrote ''[[Venus Observed]]'', which was produced at the [[St James's Theatre]] by [[Laurence Olivier]]. ''[[A Sleep of Prisoners]]'' followed in 1951, first performed at St Thomas' church in [[Regent Street]], London, in 1951 and later touring with [[Denholm Elliott]] and [[Stanley Baker]].

''[[The Dark is Light Enough (play)|The Dark is Light Enough]]'', a winter play starring [[Katharine Cornell]] and  [[Edith Evans]] in 1954, was third in a quartet of "seasonal" plays, featured incidental music written by [[Leonard Bernstein]].<ref>Mosel, ''Leading Lady:  The World and Theatre of Katharine Cornell''</ref> The production also featured [[Tyrone Power]], [[Lorne Greene]] and [[Marian Winters]].  [[Christopher Plummer]] had an understudy role that he wrote about in his memoir. This play followed the springtime of ''The Lady’s Not For Burning'' and the autumnal ''Venus Observed''. The quartet was completed in 1970 with ''A Yard Of Sun'', representing summer.

His next plays were translations from French dramatists: ''The Lark'', an adaptation of [[Jean Anouilh]]’s '' [[The Lark (play)|L'Alouette]]'' ("The Lark"), in 1955; ''[[The Trojan War Will Not Take Place|Tiger At The Gates]]'', based on [[Jean Giraudoux]]’s ''[[La guerre de Troie n'aura pas lieu]]'', also in 1955; ''[[Duel of Angels]]'', adapted from Giraudoux's ''Pour Lucrèce'', in 1960; and ''[[Judith (Giraudoux)|Judith]]'', also by Giraudoux, in 1962.

Although Fry lived until 2005, his poetic style of drama began to fall out of fashion with the advent of the [[Angry Young Men]] of British theatre in the mid-1950s. Despite working mainly for the cinema in the 1960s, he continued to write plays, including ''Curtmantle'' for the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] in 1962, and ''A Yard of Sun'' – the fourth in his seasonal quartet – at the [[Nottingham Playhouse]] in 1970.

''Curtmantle''{{'}}s (1962) plot deals with [[Henry II of England]] and his conflict with [[Thomas Becket]]. ''A Yard of Sun'' (1970) is set just after World War II at the time of the famous annual horse race [[Palio di Siena]] in the streets of [[Siena]].

After the success of his post-war plays Fry bought Trebinshwn, a fine [[Regency architecture|Regency]] house in [[Breconshire]]. When living there he used to walk over the hill behind the house, the Allt, to [[Llansantffraed]] church, where the 17th-century poet [[Henry Vaughan]] is buried,<ref>C. Fry, Death is a Kind of Love</ref> and Vaughan's poetry was a strong influence on him.

During the next ten years, he concentrated on further translations, including [[Henrik Ibsen]]’s ''[[Peer Gynt]]'' and [[Edmond Rostand]]’s ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' which were produced at the [[Chichester Festival Theatre]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.roguesandvagabonds.co.uk/cgi-bin/newslist.pl?bid=10157&num=6&coinc=0 |title=Article on theatre history website Rogues and Vagabonds |access-date=9 February 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116151820/http://www.roguesandvagabonds.co.uk/cgi-bin/newslist.pl?bid=10157&num=6&coinc=0 |archive-date=16 January 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 1986, he wrote ''One Thing More'', a play about the 7th century Northumbrian monk [[Cædmon]] who was suddenly given the gift of composing song;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/one-thing-more-or-caedmon-construed/oclc/19518731&referer=brief_results|title=One thing more, or, Caedmon construed|first=Christopher|last=Fry|date=31 October 1987|publisher=Dramatists Play Service|via=Open WorldCat}}</ref> it was first performed at [[Whitby Abbey]] by the Next Stage Company directed by Joan White and then broadcast on the [[BBC]], with further productions in [[London]] and [[Oxford]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O1/O11/O117/O1173/O11736/O1173674/|title=Document &#124; Fry, Christopher &#124; V&A Explore The Collections|first=Victoria and Albert|last=Museum|website=Victoria and Albert Museum: Explore the Collections}}</ref>

His last play, ''A Ringing Of Bells'', was commissioned by his old school, [[Bedford Modern School]], and performed there in 2000. The following year, a new production was performed at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]].

In later life Fry lived in the village of [[East Dean, West Sussex|East Dean]] in [[West Sussex]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://lib.rochester.edu/camelot/intrvws/fry.htm |title=Interview with Christopher Fry |access-date=29 September 2007|date =16 May 1989 |archive-date=30 May 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530125845/http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/intrvws/fry.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref> and died, from natural causes, in [[Chichester]] in 2005.{{fact|date=July 2021}}His wife, Phyllis, whom he married in 1936, died in 1987. He was survived by their son, Tam.

===Revivals===
Revivals of his plays include a staged reading of ''The Lady's Not For Burning'' at the National Theatre in 2001 as one of the 100 best plays of the 20th century, with actors [[Alex Jennings]], [[Prunella Scales]] and [[Samuel West]]. West went on to produce ''The Lady’s Not For Burning'' at [[Chichester Festival Theatre]]'s [[Minerva Theatre, Chichester|Minerva Theatre]] in 2002 with Nancy Carroll and Benjamin Whitrow. In 2007, it was performed in a new production at the [[Finborough Theatre]], London.

''Ring Round The Moon'' was revived at the Theatre Royal Haymarket 1967-68. starring [[John Standing]] and [[Angela Thorne]]. In 2008, it was revived again, directed by [[Sean Mathias]], once again starring [[Angela Thorne]], graduating from the role of young Diana to the wheelchair-using Madame Desmortes. Other cast members included [[JJ Feild]], [[Joanna David]], [[Belinda Lang]], [[John Ramm]] and [[Leigh Lawson]].<ref>Stage review of the [[Playhouse Theatre]] 2008 revival of ''Ring Round the Moon''  [http://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/review.php/19894/ring-round-the-moon]</ref>
