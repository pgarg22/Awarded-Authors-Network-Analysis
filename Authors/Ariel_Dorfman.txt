==Background and education==
Dorfman was born in [[Buenos Aires]] on May 6, 1942, the son of Adolf Dorfman, who was born in [[Odessa]] (then [[Russian Empire]]) to a well-to-do Jewish family,<ref>{{cite book |last=Dorfman |first=Ariel |date=1998 |title=Heading South, Looking North: A Bilingual Journey |location=New York |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780374168629/page/18 18] |isbn=0374168628 |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780374168629/page/18 }}</ref> and became a prominent Argentine professor of economics and the author of ''Historia de la Industria Argentina'', and Fanny Zelicovich Dorfman, who was born in [[Chișinău|Kishinev]] of [[Bessarabia]]n Jewish descent.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.thevillager.com/villager_138/arieldorfmansbedroom.html |title= Ariel Dorfman's Bedroom War |publisher= by Jerry Tallmer for thevillager.com |date= December 27, 2005 |access-date= July 17, 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160303175446/http://thevillager.com/villager_138/arieldorfmansbedroom.html |archive-date= March 3, 2016 |url-status= dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.progressive.org/mag_intv_dorfman |title= Ariel Dorfman Interview |publisher= by Danny Postel for [[The Progressive]] |date= December 13, 1998}}</ref> Shortly after his birth, they moved to the United States and then, in 1954, moved to [[Chile]].<ref>{{in lang|es}} [http://www.gacemail.com.ar/Detalle.asp?NotaID=10101 El largo exilio de Ariel Dorfman] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706081626/http://www.gacemail.com.ar/Detalle.asp?NotaID=10101 |date=July 6, 2011 }}</ref>  He attended and later worked as a professor at the [[University of Chile]], marrying Angélica Malinarich in 1966 and becoming a Chilean citizen in 1967.  From 1968 to 1969, he attended graduate school at the [[University of California at Berkeley]] and then returned to Chile.

Since the [[restoration of democracy in Chile]], in 1990, he and his wife Angélica have divided their time between [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] and the United States.

==Career==
From 1970 to 1973, Dorfman served as a cultural adviser to President [[Salvador Allende]]. During this time he wrote, with Armand Mattelart, a critique of [[North America]]n [[cultural imperialism]], ''[[How to Read Donald Duck]]''. Dorfman was supposed to work on the night shift at the [[La Moneda]] presidential palace the night before the Pinochet coup, but he had swapped his shift with his friend Claudio Jimeno, not knowing what was to come. Forced to leave Chile in 1973, after the coup by General [[Augusto Pinochet]] leading to [[Death of Salvador Allende|Allende's suicide]] at the Presidential Palace on 11 September 1973, Dorfman went on to live in [[Paris]], [[Amsterdam]], and [[Washington, D.C.]]  Since 1985 he has taught at [[Duke University]], where he is currently Walter Hines Page Research Professor of Literature and Professor of [[Latin American Studies]].

Dorfman was a member of the [[Group of 88]], a group of signatories of a controversial advertisement in [[The Chronicle (Duke University)|''The Chronicle'']], Duke's student newspaper<ref name="Ad">{{cite web |url=http://www.duke.edu/web/africanameric/listening.pdf |title=What Does a Social Disaster Sound Like? |publisher=African & African American Studies Department, Duke University |access-date=May 19, 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825054233/http://www.duke.edu/web/africanameric/listening.pdf |archive-date=August 25, 2006 }}</ref><ref name="Supporters">{{cite web |url=http://www.duke.edu/web/africanameric/supporters.pdf |title=List of Supporters |publisher=African & African American Studies Department, Duke University |access-date=November 16, 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060415004657/http://www.duke.edu/web/africanameric/supporters.pdf |archive-date=April 15, 2006 }}</ref> during the [[Duke lacrosse case]].

Dorfman details his life of exile and bi-cultural living in his memoir, ''Heading South, Looking North'', which has been acclaimed by [[Elie Wiesel]], [[Nadine Gordimer]], [[Thomas Keneally]] and others.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

In 2020 he wrote in the Los Angeles Times: “Fifty years ago today, on the night of Sept. 4, 1970, I was dancing, along with a multitude of others, in the streets of Santiago de Chile. We were celebrating the election of Salvador Allende, the first democratically elected socialist leader in the world. President Allende’s victory had historical significance beyond Chile. Before then, political revolutions had been violent, imposed by force of arms. Allende and his left-wing coalition used peaceful means, proclaiming it unnecessary to repress one’s adversaries to achieve social justice. Radical change could happen within the confines and promises of a democracy. I have often fantasized about how different the world would be if Allende had not been overthrown, three years later, in a bloody coup. I wonder where humanity would be if his peaceful revolution had been allowed to run its course and become a template for other countries.”<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dorfman |first1=Ariel |title=I danced in the streets after Allende's victory in Chile 50 years ago.

==Literary work==
[[File:Ariel Dorfman (1463213435) (cropped).jpg|thumb|Dorfman in 2007]]
Dorfman's work often deals with the horrors of tyranny and, in later works, the trials of exile. In an interview in ''[[BOMB Magazine]]'', Dorfman said, "I'm constantly trying to figure out how you can be true to an experience which in fact very few people in the world would understand, such as having most of your friends disappear or be tortured, and at the same time finding a way of telling that story so other people in other places can read their own lives into that." His most famous play, ''[[Death and the Maiden (play)|Death and the Maiden]]'', describes the encounter of a former torture victim with the man she believed tortured her; it was made into a [[Death and the Maiden (film)|film in 1994]] by [[Roman Polanski]] starring [[Sigourney Weaver]] and [[Ben Kingsley]]. Dorfman identified "the stark, painful Chilean transition to democracy" as ''Death and the Maiden'''s central theme.<ref name=Berman>Berman, Jenifer. [http://bombsite.com/issues/50/articles/1833 "Ariel Dorfman"]. ''[[BOMB Magazine]]''. Winter 1995. Retrieved 25 July 2011.</ref> The play received a 20th anniversary revival in the 2011–2012 season at the [[Harold Pinter Theatre]] in London's West End, directed by [[Jeremy Herrin]] and starring [[Thandie Newton]], [[Tom Goodman-Hill]], and [[Anthony Calf]].  The story was adapted in 2020 into a second English-language film, ''[[The Secrets We Keep]]'', directed by [[Yuval Adler]], screenplay by Adler and Ryan Covington, and starring [[Noomi Rapace]], [[Joel Kinnaman]], and [[Chris Messina]].

His thesis on [[Absurdism|the absurd]] in plays of [[Harold Pinter]] was published in Spanish as ''El absurdo entre cuatro paredes: el teatro de Harold Pinter'' ''(The absurd within four walls: the theater of Harold Pinter)'' by Editorial Universitaria, in [[Santiago, Chile]], in 1968 (124 pages).<ref name=WorldCat>Ariel Dorfman, ''[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1400001?referer=di&ht=edition El absurdo entre cuatro paredes: el teatro de Harold Pinter]''.

A critic of Pinochet, he has written extensively about the General's extradition case for the Spanish newspaper ''[[El País]]'' and other publications, and in the book ''Exorcising Terror: The Incredible Unending Trial of Gen. Augusto Pinochet.'' Rather than distinguishing between politics and art, Dorfman believes "that one’s writing is deeply political," and, at its best, "engages the major dilemmas...of the community."<ref name=Berman/>

Dorfman's works have been translated into more than 40 languages and performed in over 100 countries. Besides poetry, essays and novels— ''Hard Rain'', winner of the Sudamericana Award; ''Widows''; ''The Last Song of Manuel Sendero''; ''Mascara''; ''Konfidenz''; ''The Nanny and the Iceberg'', and Blake's ''Therapy''—he has written short stories, including ''My House Is on Fire'', and general nonfiction including ''The Empire’s Old Clothes: What the [[Lone Ranger]], [[Babar the Elephant|Babar]], and Other Innocent Heroes Do to Our Minds''. He has won various international awards, including two [[Kennedy Center]] Theater Awards. In 1996, with his son, Rodrigo, he received an award for best television drama in Britain for ''Prisoners in Time.'' His poems, collected in ''Last Waltz in Santiago'' and ''In Case of Fire in a Foreign Land'', have been turned into a half-hour fictional film, ''Deadline,'' featuring the voices of [[Emma Thompson]], [[Bono]], [[Harold Pinter]], and others.

Dorfman's [[human rights]] play, ''Speak Truth to Power: Voices from Beyond the Dark''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.speaktruth.org/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-08-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828221511/http://www.speaktruth.org/ |archive-date=2008-08-28}}</ref> (based on interviews with human rights defenders conducted by [[Kerry Kennedy Cuomo]]), premiered at the Kennedy Center in [[Washington, D.C.]], in 2000, and subsequently aired on [[PBS]] as part of its ''[[Great Performances]]'' series. The play starred [[Kevin Kline]], [[Sigourney Weaver]], [[Alec Baldwin]], and [[John Malkovich]], among others, and was directed by [[Gregory Mosher|Greg Mosher]]. It has gone on to numerous performances around the world, including a run in [[New York City]]. On May 3, 2010, a "Speak Truth to Power" benefit for survivors of the [[2010 Chilean earthquake]] was put on by [[New York's Public Theater]], directed by [[David Esbjornson]], and featuring an all-star cast of [[Elias Koteas]], [[Marcia Gay Harden]], [[Alfred Molina]], [[Julianne Moore]], [[Viggo Mortensen]], [[Gloria Reuben]], [[Paul Sorvino]], [[Meryl Streep]], [[Stanley Tucci]], and [[Debra Winger]].

Dorfman's play ''The Other Side'' had its world premiere at the [[New National Theatre]] in [[Tokyo]] in 2004 and opened [[off-Broadway]] at the [[Manhattan Theater Club]] in 2005.  Other recent plays include ''Purgatorio'' at the [[Seattle Rep]] in 2005 and at the [[Arcola Theatre]] in London in 2008; ''Picasso’s Closet,'' a counterfactual history in which the [[Nazis]] murder [[Picasso]], had its premiere at [[Theater J]] in Washington, D.C. in 2006.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/29/AR2006062900740.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Dorfman Limns a Tangle of Ethics in 'Picasso' | first=John | last=Barry | date=2006-06-30 | access-date=2010-04-25}}</ref>

He is also the subject of a feature-length documentary, ''[[A Promise to the Dead: The Exile Journey of Ariel Dorfman]]'', based on his memoir ''Heading South, Looking North'' and directed by [[Peter Raymont]]. The film had its world premiere at the [[2007 Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 8, 2007. In November 2007, the film was named by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] as one of 15 films on its documentary feature Oscar shortlist. The list was narrowed to five films on January 22, 2008,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i587be3b0ca27043557eff60b69803664 |title=Shortlist for docu Oscar unveiled |access-date=2007-12-21 |date=2007-11-20 |publisher=The Hollywood Reporter |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705063437/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i587be3b0ca27043557eff60b69803664 |archive-date=2008-07-05 |url-status=live}}</ref> and ''A Promise to the Dead'' was not among the five Oscar-nominated documentaries.

His latest works include the [[Lowell Thomas Award]]-winning travel book, ''Desert Memories''; a collection of essays, ''Other Septembers, Many Americas''; a novel he wrote with his youngest son, [[Joaquin Dorfman|Joaquín]], ''Burning City''; ''Americanos: Los Pasos de Murieta''; and a new volume of memoirs, ''Feeding on Dreams: Confessions of an Unrepentant Exile''. In 2007, his musical, ''Dancing Shadows'', opened in [[Seoul]], Korea. This collaboration with [[Eric Woolfson]], the principal composer for the [[Alan Parsons Project]], won five Korean “Tony” awards. In 2011, his play "Purgatorio" has its Spanish language premiere at the [[Teatro Español in Madrid]], starring [[Viggo Mortensen]] and [[Carme Elias]].

Dorfman currently has several film projects in development with his sons, [[Rodrigo Dorfman|Rodrigo]] and [[Joaquin Dorfman]], including a screen adaptation of his novel, ''Blake’s Therapy''.

Dorfman also writes regularly for such publications as ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[The Guardian]]'' (where he has a featured [[blog]]), ''[[Le Monde]]'' and ''[[L'Unità]]''.

He is a member of L'Académie Universelle des Cultures, in [[Paris]], and the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].
