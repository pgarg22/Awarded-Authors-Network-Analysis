'''Gene Rodman Wolfe''' (May 7, 1931 – April 14, 2019) was an American [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] writer. He was noted for his dense, allusive prose as well as the strong influence of his [[Catholic]] faith. He was a prolific [[short story]] writer and novelist, and won many literary awards.<ref name=SFAwards/> Wolfe has been called "the [[Herman Melville|Melville]] of science fiction",<ref name=new-yorker-2015/><ref name=SFE/> and was honored as a [[Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award|Grand Master]] by the [[Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America]].<ref name=guardian-2012/>

Wolfe is best known for his ''[[The Book of the New Sun|Book of the New Sun]]'' series (four volumes, 1980–1983), the first part of his "Solar Cycle".<ref name="isfdb-cycle"/> In 1998, ''[[Locus (magazine)|Locus]]'' magazine ranked it the third-best fantasy novel published before 1990 based on a poll of subscribers that considered it and several other series as single entries.{{efn|name=alltime|group=notes|1=''Locus'' subscribers voted only two [[Middle-earth]] novels by [[J.

Wolfe lived in [[Barrington, Illinois]], a suburb of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], with his wife Rosemary, where they raised four children. Wolfe also has three granddaughters.

==Literary works==
Wolfe's first published book was the [[paperback original]] novel ''Operation Ares'' ([[Berkley Books|Berkley Medallion]], 1970).<ref name=isfdb/> He first received critical attention for ''The Fifth Head of Cerberus'' ([[Scribner's]], 1972), which examines "colonial mentality within an orthodox science fiction framework".<ref name=jrank/> It was published in German and French-language editions within the decade.<ref name=isfdb/>

His best-known and most highly regarded work is the multi-volume novel ''[[The Book of the New Sun]]''. Set in a bleak, distant future influenced by [[Jack Vance]]'s ''[[Dying Earth]]'' series, the story details the life of [[Severian]], a journeyman torturer, exiled from his guild for showing compassion to one of the condemned. The novel is composed of the volumes ''The Shadow of the Torturer'' (1980), ''The Claw of the Conciliator'' (1981; winner of the [[Nebula Award]] for [[Nebula Award for Best Novel|Best Novel]]), ''The Sword of the Lictor'' (1982), and ''The Citadel of the Autarch'' (1983). A coda, ''[[The Urth of the New Sun]]'' (1987), wraps up some loose ends but is generally considered a separate work. Several of Wolfe's essays about writing the ''Book of the New Sun'' series were published in ''[[The Castle of the Otter]]'' (1982; the title refers to a misprint of the fourth book's title in ''[[Locus (magazine)|Locus]]'' magazine).

In 1984, Wolfe retired from his engineering position and was then able to devote more time to his writing. In the 1990s, Wolfe published two more works in the same universe as ''The Book of the New Sun''. The first, ''[[The Book of the Long Sun]]'', consists of the novels ''Nightside the Long Sun'' (1993), ''Lake of the Long Sun'' (1994), ''Caldé of the Long Sun'' (1994), and ''Exodus From the Long Sun'' (1996). These books follow the priest of a small parish as he becomes wrapped up in political intrigue and revolution in his city-state. Wolfe then wrote a sequel, ''[[The Book of the Short Sun]]'', composed of ''On Blue's Waters'' (1999), ''In Green's Jungles'' (2000), and ''Return to the Whorl'' (2001), dealing with colonists who have arrived on the sister planets Blue and Green. The four ''Sun'' works (''The Book of the New Sun'', ''The Urth of the New Sun'', ''The Book of the Long Sun'', and ''The Book of the Short Sun'') are often referred to collectively as the "Solar Cycle".

Wolfe also wrote many stand-alone books. His first novel, ''[[Operation Ares]]'', was published by Berkley Books in 1970 and was unsuccessful. He subsequently wrote two novels held in particularly high esteem, ''[[Peace (novel)|Peace]]'' and ''[[The Fifth Head of Cerberus]]''. The first is the seemingly-rambling narrative of Alden Dennis Weer, a man of many secrets who reviews his life under mysterious circumstances. ''The Fifth Head of Cerberus'' is either a collection of three novellas or a novel in three parts, dealing with colonialism, memory, and the nature of personal identity. The first story, which gives the book its name, was nominated for the [[Nebula Award for Best Novella]].

==Style==

Wolfe's writing frequently relies on the first-person perspectives of [[unreliable narrator]]s. He said: "Real people really are unreliable narrators all the time, even if they try to be reliable narrators."<ref name="PersonInterview"/>  The causes for the unreliability of his characters vary. Some are naive, as in ''Pandora by Holly Hollander'' or ''The Knight''; others are not particularly intelligent<ref>''Shadows of the New Sun'', p. 112 – "I wanted to present a protagonist who isn't very intelligent.  Green isn't."</ref> (''There Are Doors''); Severian, from ''The Book of the New Sun'', is not always truthful; and Latro of the ''Soldier'' series suffers from recurrent amnesia.

Wolfe wrote in a letter, "My definition of a great story has nothing to do with 'a varied and interesting background.' It is: ''One that can be read with pleasure by a cultivated reader and reread with increasing pleasure.''"<ref>"From a Chain letter to George R. R. Martin and Greg Benford", 10 July 1982; as published in Gene Wolfe, ''Castle of Days'' (1992) [italics in source]</ref> In that spirit, Wolfe also left subtle hints and [[Lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]] that may never be explicitly referred to in the text. For example, a backyard full of [[morning glories]] is an intentional foreshadowing of events in ''Free Live Free'', but is apparent only to a reader with a horticultural background, and a [[story within a story|story-within-the-story]] provides a clue to understanding ''Peace''.

Wolfe's language can also be a subject of confusion for the new reader. In the appendix to ''The Shadow of the Torturer,'' he says:

<blockquote>In rendering this book—originally composed in a tongue that has not achieved existence—into English, I might easily have saved myself a great deal of labor by having recourse to invented terms; in no case have I done so. Thus in many instances I have been forced to replace yet undiscovered concepts by their closest twentieth-century equivalents. Such words as ''peltast'', ''androgyn'', and ''exultant'' are substitutions of this kind, and are intended to be suggestive rather than definitive.<ref>{{cite book | last = Wolfe | first = Gene | title = Shadow & Claw | publisher = [[Tor Books]] | isbn = 978-0-312-89017-9 | page = [https://archive.org/details/shadowclaw0000wolf/page/211 211] | year = 1994 | url = https://archive.org/details/shadowclaw0000wolf/page/211 }}</ref></blockquote>

This character of the fictional "translator" of his novel provides a certain insight into Wolfe's writing: all of his terms—''[[fuligin]]'', ''[[Wikt:carnifex|carnifex]]'', ''[[thaumaturge]]'', and so on—are real words.

==Reception==
Although he was not a best-selling author, Wolfe is highly regarded by critics{{efn|Such as [[John Clute]], who writes: "Though neither the most popular nor the most influential author in the sf field, Gene Wolfe is today quite possibly the most important. The inherent stature of his work is deeply impressive and he wears the fictional worlds of sf like a coat of many colors."<ref name=SFE/><!-- quoted in http://thegravelpit.wordpress.com/2007/12/14/reflections-on-gene-wolfes-shadow-and-claw-anthology/ -->}} and fellow writers. He was often considered to be not only one of the greatest science fiction authors, but one of the best American writers regardless of genre. In 2003, award-winning science fiction author [[Michael Swanwick]] said: "Gene Wolfe is the greatest writer in the English language alive today. Let me repeat that: Gene Wolfe is the greatest writer in the English language alive today! I mean it. [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] was a better stylist, [[Herman Melville|Melville]] was more important to American letters, and [[Charles Dickens]] had a defter hand at creating characters. But among living writers, there is nobody who can even approach Gene Wolfe for brilliance of prose, clarity of thought, and depth in meaning."<ref name="SwanwickInterview">{{cite web|url=http://www.themodernword.com/features/interview_swanwick.html |title=Michael Swanwick interview |publisher=Themodernword.com |date=2003-09-26 |access-date=2013-12-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207152110/http://themodernword.com/features/interview_swanwick.html |archive-date=2013-12-07 }}</ref>

Among others, writers [[Neil Gaiman]] and [[Patrick O'Leary (writer)|Patrick O'Leary]] have credited Wolfe for inspiration. O'Leary has said: "Forget 'Speculative Fiction.' Gene Wolfe is the best writer alive. Period. And as Wolfe once said, 'All novels are fantasies. Some are more honest about it.' No comparison. Nobody – I mean nobody – comes close to what this artist does."<ref name="OLearyInterview">{{cite web|url=http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/nonfiction/intpol.htm |title=Interview with Patrick O'Leary |publisher=Infinityplus.co.uk |date=2000-11-11 |access-date=2013-12-30}}</ref> O'Leary also wrote an extensive essay concerning the nature of Wolfe's artistry, entitled "If Ever A Wiz There Was",<ref name=wiz>{{Cite web |url=http://web.mac.com/paddybon/Site/a_tribute_to_Gene_Wolfe.html |title="If Ever A Wiz There Was" |access-date=June 13, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616151502/http://web.mac.com/paddybon/Site/a_tribute_to_Gene_Wolfe.html |archive-date=June 16, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> originally published in his collection ''Other Voices, Other Doors''. [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] is frequently quoted on the jackets of Wolfe's books as having said "Wolfe is our Melville."

Critic and science fiction writer [[Harlan Ellison]], reviewing ''[[The Shadow of the Torturer]]'', wrote: "Gene Wolfe is engaged in the holy chore of writing every other author under the table. He is no less than one of the finest, most original writers in the world today. His work is singular, hypnotizing, startlingly above comparison. ''The Shadow of the Torturer'' breaks new ground in American literature and, as the first novel of a tetralogy, casts a fierce light on what will certainly be a lodestone landmark, his most stunning work to date. It is often said, but never more surely than this time: This book is not to be missed at peril of one's intellectual enrichment."<ref>[http://www.apocalypsebooks.com/books/urth-book-new-sun-shadow-torturer/]</ref>

Wolfe's fans regard him with considerable dedication, and one Internet mailing list<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.urth.net/|title=URTH: Discussion of the works of Gene Wolfe|website=www.urth.net|access-date=2019-04-15}}</ref> (URTH, begun in November 1996) dedicated to his works has amassed over ten years and thousands of pages of discussion and explication. Similarly, much analysis and exegesis has been published in fanzine and small-press form (e.g. ''Lexicon Urthus'' {{ISBN|0-9642795-9-2}}).

When asked the "Most overrated" and "Most underrated" authors, [[Thomas M. Disch]] identified [[Isaac Asimov]] and Gene Wolfe, respectively, writing: "...all too many have already gone into a decline after carrying home some trophies. The one exception is Gene Wolfe...Between 1980 and 1982 he published ''The Book of the New Sun'', a tetralogy of couth, intelligence, and suavity that is also written in [[VistaVision]] with [[Dolby Laboratories|Dolby Sound]]. Imagine a ''[[Star Wars]]''–style [[space opera]] penned by [[G. K. Chesterton]] in the throes of a religious conversion. Wolfe has continued in full diapason ever since, and a crossover success is long overdue."<ref>From an article first published in ''American Heritage'' May–June 1999. Pg 211 of ''Overrated/underrated: 100 experts topple the icons and champion the slighted'', ed. by the editors of [[American Heritage (magazine)|''American Heritage'']] magazine. 2001, {{ISBN|1-57912-163-2}}, 256 pages, hardcover.</ref>

Early in his writing career, Wolfe exchanged correspondence with [[J. R. R. Tolkien]].<ref>''The Annotated Hobbit'', 2002 revised and expanded edition, p. 146 n.9; see also Wolfe's [http://home.clara.net/andywrobertson/wolfemountains.html "The Best Introduction To The Mountains"] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20040113063643/http%3A//home.clara.net/andywrobertson/wolfemountains.html |date=2004-01-13 }}</ref>
