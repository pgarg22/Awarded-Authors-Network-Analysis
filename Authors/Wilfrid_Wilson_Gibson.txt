Gibson was born in [[Hexham]], [[Northumberland]], and left the north for London in 1914 after his mother died. He had been publishing poems in magazines since 1895, and his first collections in book form were published by [[Elkin Mathews]] in 1902. His collections of verse plays and dramatic poems ''The Stonefolds'' and ''On The Threshold'' were published by the Samurai Press (of [[Cranleigh]]) in 1907, followed next year by the book of poems, ''The Web of Life''.<ref>'"Young men who knew that the age demanded something new in poetry were impressed by the austerity of his little 'working class' plays". (Joy Grant, ''Harold Monro & the Poetry Bookshop'' (1966), p. 19. Whistler p. 281 remarks on the ''colloquial, homespun realism'' that at first was admired in Gibson.</ref>

Despite his residence in London, and later in [[Gloucestershire]], many of Gibson's poems both then and later, have Northumberland settings: ''Hexham's Market Cross''; ''Hareshaw''; and ''The Kielder Stone''. Others deal with poverty and passion amid wild Northumbrian landscapes. Still others are devoted to fishermen, industrial workers and miners, often alluding to local ballads and the rich folk-song heritage of the [[North East England|North East]].

It was in London that he met both [[Edward Marsh (polymath)|Edward Marsh]] and [[Rupert Brooke]], becoming a close friend and later Brooke's [[literary executor]] (with [[Lascelles Abercrombie]] and [[Walter de la Mare]]).<ref>Gibson met de la Mare, and quite a number of other poets, through Marsh (Theresa Whistler, ''Imagination of the Heart: The Life of Walter de la Mare'' (1993), p. 205 and 208) in 1912. ''It was with de la Mare that Gibson was to make the closest friendship. Gentle and unlucky, he himself best fitted Brooke's description of those good-hearted and simple and nice poets he wanted to protect.''</ref> This was at the period when the first ''[[Georgian Poetry]]'' anthology was being hatched. Gibson was one of the insiders.<ref>Paul Delany, ''The Neo-Pagans'' (1987), p. 199, writes of a business lunch 19 September 1912 at Marsh's flat, with Gibson, [[John Drinkwater (playwright)|John Drinkwater]], [[Harold Monro]] and [[Arundel del Re]].</ref>

During the early part of his writing life, Wilfrid Wilson Gibson wrote poems that featured the "macabre." One such poem is ''[[Flannan Isle]]'', based on [[Flannan Isles#Mystery of 1900|a real life mystery]].

Gibson was one of the founders of the [[Dymock poets]], a community of writers who settled briefly, before the outbreak of the Great War, in the village of [[Dymock]], in north Gloucestershire.<ref>[http://www.royalforestofdean.info/famous-people.shtml Famous People of Herefordshire, Monmouthshire and Royal Forest of Dean at royalforestofdean.info]</ref>

There are indications that he wrote prose as well. For instance, he wrote and argued beautifully about the merit of verse at the time of World War II.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gibson|first=Wilfrid|date=1940-10-01|url=https://academic.oup.com/english/article/3/15/109/460457|journal=English: Journal of the English Association|language=en|volume=3|issue=15|pages=109–111|doi=10.1093/english/3.15.109|issn=0013-8215|title=Only Time Will Tell: An Indeterminate Meditation}}</ref> He wrote a piece of criticism on ''Italian Nationalism and English Letters'' by Harry W. Rudman regarding the contributions made by Italian exiles in England to English literature, which were in the form of poetry by and large.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gibson|first=Wilfrid|date=1940-10-01|title=Italian Nationalism and English Letters|url=https://academic.oup.com/english/article/3/15/142-a/460545|journal=English: Journal of the English Association|language=en|volume=3|issue=15|pages=142–a–142|doi=10.1093/english/3.15.142-a|issn=0013-8215}}</ref> He also wrote criticism on ''The Burning Oracle: Studies in the Poetry of Action'' by G. Wilson Knight, wherein he commends the fact that Knight sees the creative energy of living writers not only in the creation of artworks but also in the creation of life itself.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gibson|first=Wilfred|date=1940-03-01|title=The Burning Oracle: Studies in the Poetry of Action|url=https://academic.oup.com/english/article/3/13/35/438811|journal=English: Journal of the English Association|language=en|volume=3|issue=13|pages=35–36|doi=10.1093/english/3.13.35|issn=0013-8215}}</ref>

==Death and reputation==
Gibson died on 26 May 1962, in [[Virginia Water]], [[Surrey]].<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eKNK1YwHcQ4C&pg=PA461 | title=Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of Literature| year=1995| isbn=9780877790426}}</ref>

His reputation was eclipsed somewhat by the [[Ezra Pound]]-[[T. S. Eliot]] school of [[Modernist poetry]];<ref>[http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&UID=4980 The ''Literary Encyclopedia''] states that his reputation plummeted. Whistler p. 282 has ''Gibson's was the saddest fate of all the Georgians. Once acclaimed as the leader of an exciting new movement, , when that movement came into derision the critics found in him the epitome of its vices.</ref><ref>[[Arthur Clutton-Brock]] (TLS, 24 February 1927, ''Five Modern Poets'') considers Gibson alongside Eliot, [[George William Russell|AE]], [[Herbert Read]] and [[James Stephens (author)|James Stephens]] (pp 113-114). It is concluded there that "Mr Gibson's poetry... has its own specific qualities and is, in its essentials unique". In 1942 Philip Tomlinson refers to Gibson as "this distinguished poet" (TLS 31 January 1942 p. 57).</ref> his work remained popular.
