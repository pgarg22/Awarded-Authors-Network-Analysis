Barker came to prominence in the mid-1980s with a series of [[short stories]], the ''[[Books of Blood]]'', which established him as a leading horror writer. He has since written many novels and other works, and his fiction has been adapted into films, notably the ''[[Hellraiser (franchise)|Hellraiser]]'' series, the first installment of which he also wrote and directed, and the ''[[Candyman (film series)|Candyman]]'' series. Barker also serves as an [[executive producer]] on the film ''[[Gods and Monsters (film)|Gods and Monsters]]'', which won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]].

Barker's paintings and illustrations have been featured in galleries in the United States as well as within his own books. He has created original characters and series for comic books, and some of his more popular horror stories have been featured in ongoing comics series.

==Early life==
Barker was born in [[Liverpool]], the son of Joan Ruby (née Revill), a painter and school welfare officer, and Leonard Barker, a personnel director for an industrial relations firm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/98/Clive-Barker.html|title=Clive Barker Biography|publisher=Filmreference.com|access-date=30 October 2014}}</ref><ref>[https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800022056/bio]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604003038/http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800022056/bio |date=4 June 2011 }}</ref> He was educated at [[Dovedale Primary School]], [[Calderstones School|Quarry Bank High School]] and the [[University of Liverpool]], where he studied English and philosophy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/whats-on/arts-culture-news/clive-barker-returns-heres-eight-9289121|title=As Clive Barker returns here's eight other Merseyside sci fi, fantasy and horror writers who have thrilled readers worldwide|author=Jamie Bowman|date=19 May 2015|work=liverpoolecho}}</ref>

When he was three years old, Barker witnessed the French skydiver [[Léo Valentin]] plummet to his death during a performance at an air show in Liverpool. Barker would later allude to Valentin in many of his stories.<ref>{{cite book|title=Birdmen, Batmen, and Skyflyers: Wingsuits and the Pioneers Who Flew in Them, Fell in Them, and Perfected Them|first=Michael|last=Abrams|pages=[https://archive.org/details/birdmenbatmensky00abra/page/131 131–132]|publisher=[[Harmony Books]]|location=[[New York City|New York]]|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4000-5491-6|url=https://archive.org/details/birdmenbatmensky00abra/page/131}}</ref>

== Theatrical work ==
Barker's involvement in live theatre began while still in school with productions of ''Voodoo'' and ''Inferno'' in 1967. He collaborated on six plays with ''Theatre of the Imagination'' in 1974 and two more that he was the sole writer of, ''A Clowns' Sodom'' and ''Day of the Dog,'' for ''The Mute Pantomime Theatre'' in 1976 and 1977.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.clivebarker.info/playsindex.html|title=The Official Clive Barker Website - Revelations - Theatre|website=www.clivebarker.info|access-date=12 November 2019}}</ref>

He co-founded the avant-garde theatrical troupe ''The Dog Company'' in 1978 with former school friends and up and coming actors, many of which would go on to become key collaborators in Barker's film work. [[Doug Bradley]] would take on the iconic role of Pinhead in the ''[[Hellraiser (franchise)|Hellraiser]]'' series while Peter Atkins would write the scripts for the first three [[Hellraiser (franchise)|Hellraiser]] sequels.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w4I2DwAAQBAJ&q=dog+company+members&pg=PA196|title=Horror Literature through History: An Encyclopedia of the Stories that Speak to Our Deepest Fears [2 volumes]|last=Cardin|first=Matt|date=21 September 2017|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781440842023|language=en}}</ref> Over the next five years Barker would write nine plays, often serving as director, including some of his most well-known stage productions, ''The History of The Devil'', ''Frankenstein in Love'', and ''The Secret Life of Cartoons''.<ref name=":0" />

From 1982 to 1983, he also created three plays, including ''Crazyface'', for the Cockpit Youth Theatre.<ref name=":0" />

His theatrical work would come to a close as he shifted focus to writing the ''[[Books of Blood]]''.

==Writing career==
Barker is an author of [[horror fiction|horror]] and [[fantasy fiction|fantasy]]. He began writing horror early in his career, mostly in the form of short stories (collected in ''[[Books of Blood]]'' 1–6) and the [[Faustian]] novel ''[[The Damnation Game (novel)|The Damnation Game]]'' (1985). Later he moved toward modern-day [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]] and [[urban fantasy]] with horror elements in ''[[Weaveworld]]'' (1987), ''[[The Great and Secret Show]]'' (1989), the world-spanning ''[[Imajica]]'' (1991), and ''[[Sacrament (novel)|Sacrament]]'' (1996).

When ''Books of Blood'' was first published in the United States in paperback, [[Stephen King]] was quoted on the book covers: "I have seen the future of horror and his name is Clive Barker."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clivebarker.info/newsstephenking.html|title=The Official Clive Barker Resource : Revelations - News Stephen King Award - Speech|publisher=Clivebarker.info|access-date=30 October 2014}}</ref> As influences on his writing, Barker lists [[Herman Melville]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Ray Bradbury]], [[William S.

He is the writer of the best-selling ''[[Abarat]]'' series.

Barker said in a December 2008 online interview (published in March 2009) that he had polyps in his throat which were so severe that a doctor told him he was taking in ten percent of the air he was supposed to have been getting. He has had two surgeries to remove them and believes his resultant voice is an improvement over how it was prior to the surgeries. He said he did not have cancer and has given up [[cigar]]s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.strangehorizons.com/2009/20090316/snyder-a.shtml|title=Art and the Artist: An Interview with Clive Barker|work=Strange Horizons|date=March 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103095110/http://strangehorizons.com/2009/20090316/snyder-a.shtml|archive-date=3 January 2010}}</ref>

In 2012, Barker went into a coma for several days after having contracted [[toxic shock syndrome]], triggered by a visit to the dentist which unloaded a spillage of poisonous bacteria into his bloodstream, almost claiming his life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/2012/02/07/clive-barker-toxic-shock/|title=Clive Barker recovering from 'near fatal' case of toxic shock syndrome|website=Entertainment Weekly|language=en|access-date=24 August 2019}}</ref> Realising he might have just a short time left to live, he decided to put his personal concerns about the world and society into the upcoming novel ''Deep Hill'', which he then thought could be his final book.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.clivebarker.info/intsrevel33.html|title=The Official Clive Barker Website - Revelations Interview 33|website=www.clivebarker.info}}</ref>

===Relationships===
While appearing on the radio call-in show ''[[Loveline]]'' on 20 August 1996, Barker stated that during his teens he had several relationships with older women, but came to identify himself as homosexual by 18 or 19 years old.<ref>{{cite episode | url = http://podcastone.com/Classic-Loveline?showAllEpisodes=true |title=Clive Barker | series = Classic Loveline | station = KROQ-FM | location = Los Angeles, California, United States | airdate = 20 August 1996 | number = 233 |access-date=23 August 2014}}</ref> His relationship with John Gregson lasted from 1975 until 1986.

==Film work==

Barker wrote the screenplays for ''[[Underworld (1985 film)|Underworld]]'' (1985) and ''[[Rawhead Rex (film)|Rawhead Rex]]'' (1986), both directed by [[George Pavlou]]. Displeased by how his material was handled, he moved to directing with ''[[Hellraiser]]'' (1987), based on his novella ''[[The Hellbound Heart]]''. After his film ''[[Nightbreed]]'' (1990) flopped, Barker returned to write and direct ''[[Lord of Illusions]]'' (1995). The short story "[[The Forbidden (short story)|The Forbidden]]", from Barker's ''Books of Blood'', provided the basis for the 1992 film ''[[Candyman (1992 film)|Candyman]]'' and its three sequels. He had been working on a series of film adaptations of his ''[[The Books of Abarat|The Abarat Quintet]]'' books under [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|The Walt Disney Company]]'s management,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/clive-barker-goes-disney/|title=Clive Barker goes Disney|last=Green|first=Willow|date=16 April 2000|website=EmpireOnline}}</ref> but due to creative differences, the project was cancelled.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thedisneyblog.com/2006/09/11/clive_barker_an/|title=Clive Barker and Disney part ways|date=11 September 2006|website=TheDisneyBlog}}</ref>
