'''Eino Leino''' (born '''Armas Einar Leopold Lönnbohm'''; 6 July 1878 – 10 January 1926) was a Finnish [[poet]] and [[journalist]] who is considered one of the pioneers of [[Finnish poetry]] and a [[national poet]] of [[Finland]]. His poems combine modern and Finnish folk elements. Much of his work is in the style of the ''[[Kalevala]]'' and folk songs in general. Nature, love, and despair are frequent themes in Leino's work.  He is beloved and widely read in Finland today.

Leino's birthday on 6 July was named [[Eino Leino Day]] (''Eino Leinon päivä'') as well as day of Finnish poetry and summer in 1992, and it is an established [[Flag flying days in Finland|Finnish flag day]].<ref name="KB"/>

==Early life==
Eino Leino was baptized as '''Armas Einar Leopold Lönnbohm''' in [[Paltamo]] as the seventh and youngest son in a family of ten children. Leino's father had changed his name from ''Antti Mustonen'' to ''Anders Lönnbohm'' to improve his chances of marrying his future upper-class wife, Anna Emilia Kyrenius.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Paltaniemen monitaitoisen patriarkan, Eino Leinon isän elämänvaiheet|url=https://agricolaverkko.fi/review/paltaniemen-monitaitoisen-patriarkan-eino-leinon-isan-elamanvaiheet/|access-date=25 February 2021|language=fi}}</ref> Eino's older brother Kasimir Leino was an important cultural figure in Finland. He was a poet, critic, and theatre director. Eino and Kasimir Leino founded a literature journal together in 1898.<ref name="KB"/>

Leino published his first poem at the age of 12 and a collection of poems, ''Maaliskuun lauluja'', at 18.<ref name="KB">{{cite web |url= https://kansallisbiografia.fi/english/person/2833 |title=Leino, Eino (1878–1926) |last1=Nevala |first1=Maria-Liisa |website=Kansallisbiografia – The National Biography of Finland |publisher=Biografiakeskus, Suomalaisen Kirjallisuuden Seura |access-date=16 January 2016 }}</ref>

Leino's parents died while he was still in school. He started school in [[Kajaani]] and continued in [[Oulu]] and [[Hämeenlinna]], where he boarded with relatives. After graduating from the Hämeenlinna secondary school, Leino started studying at the University of Helsinki.<ref name="KB"/>

==Writing career==
[[File:Pekka-Halonen,Eino-Leino-19-v.jpg|thumb|upright|Young Leino by [[Pekka Halonen]] in 1897]]
Early in his career Eino Leino was much loved and praised by the critics. He joined literary and newspaper circles and became a member of the Young Finnish circle. Among Leino's friends were the artist [[Pekka Halonen]] and [[Otto Manninen]], who gained fame as a poet and translator.<ref name="Eino Leino">{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/eleino.htm |title=Eino Leino |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305170013/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/eleino.htm |archive-date=5 March 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

As early as November 1917, Eino Leino had annoyedly warned in the ''Sunnuntai'' magazine that the country was "on the brink of [[civil war]]," and fiercely criticized the [[Socialist]]s as they set out to "pursue their cause with civil blood and the stings of a foreign conqueror" (No. 40-41 / 1917). The political situation, which escalated into the [[Finnish Civil War]], was a bitter experience for Leino, who had always written for tolerance and also appreciated the [[labor movement]] from which he had good friends. Leino experienced the events of the spring of 1918 in the [[Red Guards (Finland)|Red]]-conquered [[Helsinki]], and he described his experiences in the report novel ''The Conquest of Helsinki'' (1918). He greeted the German [[Baltic Sea Division]], which had invaded southern Finland and conquered Helsinki, as a liberator. But on the other hand, Leino later drove a general amnesty for Red Side line men and women in prisons<ref>''Suomen työmies'', November 3, 1920.</ref> and demanded the abolition of the [[death penalty]].<ref>''Työn valta'', October 29, 1918.</ref> In April 1918, Leino's six-part series of articles called "For the Finnish Workers" was published in the [[Social Democratic]] magazine ''Työn valta'' ("Power of Labor"), in which he, as an impartial writer belonging to the "civilized [[poverty]]", strongly appealed for peace and mutual understanding. “Social democracy would no longer have a future in Finland unless it was able to internalize the "eternal ideals" of [[Legitimacy (criminal law)|legitimacy]], [[democracy]] and [[civil liberty]],” he wrote.<ref>The article series "For the Finnish Workers" has been republished in Part XVI of Leino's Collected Works.</ref>

After the Finnish Civil War, Leino's idealistic faith for national unity collapsed, and his influence as a journalist and polemicist weakened. He was granted a State writer's pension in 1918 at the age of forty. Although publishing prolifically, he had financial problems and his health deteriorated.  "Life is always a struggle with eternal forces," Leino said in a letter in 1925 to his friend [[Bertel Gripenberg]].<ref name="Eino Leino"/>

[[File:Helkavirsiä.jpg|thumb|upright|Cover of ''Helkavirsiä'' by Pekka Halonen, 1903]]

Leino published over 70 books of poems and stories. The most famous of these are the two poem collections ''Helkavirsiä'' (1903 and 1916), in which he extensively uses [[Finnish mythology]] and [[Finnish folklore|folklore]].<ref name="Eino Leino"/>

In addition to writing poetry, Eino Leino wrote in newspapers about theatre and culture in general, and translated works of important writers such as Runeberg and Goethe.<ref name="KB"/>  He  was the first person in Finland to translate [[Dante]]'s [[Divine Comedy]] into Finnish.<ref name="Eino Leino"/>

In the summer of 1921, Leino traveled to [[Estonia]] for a written tour organized by the Finnish-Estonian friends Aino and [[Gustav Suits]]. With his poetry evenings, presentations and celebrations in [[Tartu]] and [[Tallinn]], the trip became a success, and Eino Leino was received everywhere as a significant poet.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://estofilia.finland.ee/2018/01/eino-leino.html | title = Eino Leino | work = Estofilia | location = Tallinn | date = 2018 | publisher = Suomen suurlähetystö | access-date = 6 July 2021 }}</ref> After his trip to Estonia, he signed his third marriage to bank clerk Hanna Laitinen. The desperate attempt to gain support and security ended almost immediately in the separation of the spouses.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://hannumakela.com/webpage/id/13.html | title = Eino Leinon elämä | first = Hannu | last = Mäkelä | access-date = 6 July 2021 | language = fi}}</ref> In 1921, Leino applied for exemption from [[Finnish nationality law|Finnish citizenship]]. He wrote letters to President [[K. J. Ståhlberg]] and Estonian Head of State [[Konstantin Päts]] asking to become an Estonian citizen. Leino was tired of the lack of [[Grant (money)|scholarships]] and the criticism he received.<ref name="yle">{{cite web|url=https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9705080|title=Tätä et tiennyt Eino Leinosta: rakkausfriikki halusi virolaiseksi ja kuoli syfilikseen|work=[[YLE]]|access-date = 6 July 2021 | language = fi}}</ref>

Leino was married three times and had one daughter, Helka. He died in 1926 at the age of 47 and later he was buried at the [[Hietaniemi Cemetery]] in Helsinki.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hietaniemen hautausmaa– merkittäviä vainajia|url=https://www.helsinginseurakunnat.fi/material/attachments/hautausmaat/hietaniemi/w8GZkM0y7/Hietaniemen_merkittavia_vainajia.pdf |publisher= Kirkko Helsingissä |access-date= 30 November 2017}}</ref> Already at that time as a famous man, he was buried at the expense of the state, and the funeral was attended by President [[L. K. Relander]] and other statesmen of the country.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.kainuuneinoleinoseura.fi/eino-leino-kronologia/ | title = Eino Leino kronologia | publisher = The Eino Leino Society of Kainuu | access-date = 6 July 2021 | language = fi}}</ref>

The most detailed biography of Leino was written in 1930s by his lover  and colleague [[L. Onerva]]. In the dramatic story Onerva is also writing about her own life.<ref name="KB"/>

There is no absolute certainty about the cause of Eino Leino's death. In the work of the writer [[Hannu Mäkelä (writer)|Hannu Mäkelä]], ''Mestari'', the cause of Leino's death is described as advanced [[spinal cord disease]] and [[calcification]] of [[blood vessel]]s, which is why blood had leaked into the brain. It is said that it had previously confused Leino's abdominal functions. According to Mäkelä, the cause of death was determined by both Dr. Wasastjerna and Dr. Lindén.<ref>{{cite web | url =https://www.kirjastot.fi/kysy/eino-leinon-kuoleman-syy | title = Eino Leinon kuoleman syy? | work = Kirjasto | access-date = 6 July 2021 | language = fi}}</ref> On the other hand, the cause of Leino's death has also been suggested to be [[syphilis]] by Leino's personal doctor Väinö Lindén on the basis of L. Onerva's biographical margin.<ref name="yle"/><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.aamulehti.fi/kulttuuri/arvoitus-ratkesi-panu-rajala-paljastaa-uudessa-kirjassaan-runoilija-eino-leinon-karun-kuolinsyyn-24423034 | title = Arvoitus ratkesi: Panu Rajala paljastaa uudessa kirjassaan runoilija Eino Leinon karun kuolinsyyn | work = [[Aamulehti]] | access-date = 6 July 2021 | language = fi}}</ref>

== Literary style and importance ==
[[File:Eino-Leino-1978.jpg|thumb|upright|The 1978 postage stamp decipting Eino Leino]]
Leino is held to be the first and most important shaper of national romanticism in Finnish literature.<ref name="HUM"/> Actually, Leino coined the term ''national neoromantism'' by himself to characterize the works by talents of young Finland such as composer [[Jean Sibelius]], painter [[Akseli Gallen-Kallela]] and architect [[Eliel Saarinen]].<ref name="PRINCE">Greene R. et al (eds.): ''The Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics'', p. 489. Princeton University Press, 2012. {{ISBN|9780691154916}}.</ref>

Leino's style developed during his 35 years long career. In his early works, including his most famous collection Helkavirsiä (1903) influence of the national epic [[Kalevala]] is visible.<ref name="HUM">{{cite web |url=http://375humanistia.helsinki.fi/en/eino-leino/eight-times-state-prizewinner |title=Eight times state prizewinner |last1=Sjöblom |first1=Tomas |website=375 humanists |publisher=Helsinki University |access-date=5 May 2016 }}</ref>

[[File:Leinon muistolaatta.jpg|thumb|upright|A memorial plaque in [[Rome]] on the banks of the [[Tiber]] on the wall of the building where Leino lived when he translated [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divina Commedia]]''.]]
In the middle of his career Leino translated classics of world literature to Finnish. At the same time he wrote his own works in several genres: poetry, plays, essays, reviews and other pieces of journalism. His work encompasses a wide emotional range, anything from profound love to misanthropy and biting criticism.<ref name="HUM"/>

In his last years, after struggles in his personal life, Leino returned to the national romantic themes of his youth.<ref name="HUM"/>
