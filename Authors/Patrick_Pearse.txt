'''Patrick Henry Pearse''' (also known as '''Pádraig''' or '''Pádraic Pearse'''; {{lang-ga|Pádraig Anraí Mac Piarais}}; 10 November 1879 – 3 May 1916) was an Irish teacher, [[barrister]], [[Irish poetry|poet]], writer, [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]], [[Irish republicanism|republican]] political activist and revolutionary who was one of the leaders of the [[Easter Rising]] in 1916. Following his execution along with fifteen others, Pearse came to be seen by many as the embodiment of the rebellion.

Pearse soon became involved in the [[Gaelic revival]]. In 1896, at the age of 16, he joined the [[Gaelic League]] (''Conradh na Gaeilge''), and in 1903, at the age of 23, he became editor of its newspaper ''[[An Claidheamh Soluis]]'' ("''The Sword of Light''").<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.minerva.mic.ul.ie//vol1/pearse.html |title=Flanagan, Frank M., "Patrick H.

In 1900, Pearse was awarded a B.A. in Modern Languages (Irish, English and French) by the [[Royal University of Ireland]], for which he had studied for two years privately and for one at [[University College Dublin]]. In the same year, he was enrolled as a [[Barrister-at-Law]] at the [[King's Inns]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucc.ie/celt/pearse.html|title=CELT: Chronology of Patrick Pearse, also known as Pádraig Pearse (Pádraig Mac Piarais)|website=ucc.ie|access-date=9 November 2008|archive-date=11 May 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511144732/http://www.ucc.ie/celt/pearse.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Pearse was called to the bar in 1901.

The appeal was heard before the [[Court of King's Bench (England)|Court of King's Bench]] in Dublin. It was Pearse's first and only court appearance as a barrister. The case was lost but it became a symbol of the struggle for Irish independence. In his 27 June 1905 ''[[An Claidheamh Soluis]]'' column, Pearse wrote of the decision, "...it was in effect decided that Irish is a foreign language on the same level with Yiddish."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://giveitsomesparkle.wordpress.com/2011/09/09/padraig-pearse-the-cart-and-an-old-song-book/|title=Padraig Pearse, the cart and an old song book|date=9 September 2011|website=Sparkle|access-date=10 April 2016|archive-date=6 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906041307/https://giveitsomesparkle.wordpress.com/2011/09/09/padraig-pearse-the-cart-and-an-old-song-book/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=McGill|first=P.J.|year=1966|title=Pearse Defends Niall Mac Giolla Bhride in Court of King's Bench, Dublin|journal=Donegal Annual|volume=1966|pages=83–85 (from 27 June 1905 article written by Patrick Pearse)|via=Google Books}}</ref>

==St Enda's==

[[File:Pearse Brother's Museum - St. Enda's Park.jpg|thumb|[[St. Enda's School|St. Enda's]], now the Pearse Museum ]]
As a cultural nationalist educated by the [[Irish Christian Brothers]], like his younger brother Willie, Pearse believed that language was intrinsic to the identity of a nation. The Irish school system, he believed, raised Ireland's youth to be good [[England|Englishmen]] or obedient Irishmen, and an alternative was needed. Thus for him and other language revivalists saving the [[Irish language]] from extinction was a cultural priority of the utmost importance. The key to saving the language, he felt, would be a sympathetic education system. To show the way he started his own bilingual school for boys, [[St. Enda's School]] (Scoil Éanna) in Cullenswood House in [[Ranelagh]], a suburb of [[County Dublin]], in 1908.<ref name="nli">{{Cite web|url = http://www.nli.ie/1916/pdf/4.4.pdf|title = Patrick Pearse|work = The 1916 Rising: Personalities and Perspectives|year = 2006|publisher = National Library of Ireland|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060519214523/http://www.nli.ie/1916/pdf/4.4.pdf|archive-date = 19 May 2006|df = dmy-all}}</ref> The pupils were taught in both Irish and English. Cullenswood House is now the home of a [[Gaelscoil]], Lios na nÓg.  With the aid of [[Thomas MacDonagh]], Pearse's younger brother [[Willie Pearse]], their mother and both Margaret and Mary Brigid Pearse, along with other (often transient) academics, it soon proved a successful experiment. Pearse did all he planned, and even took students on field trips to the [[Gaeltacht]] in the West of Ireland.

Pearse's restless idealism led him in search of an even more idyllic home for his school. He found it in The Hermitage in [[Rathfarnham]], County Dublin, now home to the [[Pearse Museum]]. In 1910 Pearse wrote that the Hermitage was an "ideal" location due to the aesthetics of the grounds and that if he could secure it, "the school would be on a level with" the more established schools of the day such as "[[Clongowes Wood College]] and [[Castleknock College]]".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UA3fbLv1EQoC&q=patrick+pearse+clongowes&pg=PA288|title=The Pedagogy of Protest: The Educational Thought and Work of Patrick H.

He strove continually to keep ahead of his debts while doing his best to maintain the school. In February 1914, he went on a fund-raising trip to the United States, where he met [[John Devoy]] and [[Joseph McGarrity]], both of whom were impressed by his fervour and supported him in raising sufficient money to secure the continued existence of the school.

==The Volunteers and Home Rule==
In April 1912 [[John Redmond]] leader of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]], which held the balance of power in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] committed the government of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] to introducing an [[Irish Home Rule Bill]].  Pearse gave the Bill a qualified welcome. He was one of four speakers, including Redmond, [[Joseph Devlin]] MP, leader of the Northern Nationalists, and [[Eoin MacNeill]] a prominent Gaelic Leaguer, who addressed a large Home Rule Rally in Dublin at the end of March 1912.  Speaking in Irish, Pearse said he thought that "a good measure can be gained if we have enough courage", but he warned, "Let the English understand that if we are again betrayed, there shall be red war throughout Ireland."<ref>Ruth Dudley Edwards, ''Patrick Pearse: The Triumph of Failure,'' (1977) p. 159</ref>

In November 1913 Pearse was invited to the inaugural meeting of the [[Irish Volunteers]]—formed in reaction to the creation of the [[Ulster Volunteers]]—whose aim was "to secure and maintain the rights and liberties common to the whole people of Ireland".<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Foy|first1=Michael|last2=Barton|first2=Brian|title=The Easter Rising|publisher=Sutton Publishing|year=2004|pages=[https://archive.org/details/easterrising0000foym/page/7 7–8]|isbn=0-7509-3433-6|url=https://archive.org/details/easterrising0000foym/page/7}}</ref> In an article entitled "The Coming Revolution" (November 1913) Pearse wrote: 
{{quote|As to what your work as an Irish Nationalist is to be, I cannot conjecture; I know what mine is to be, and would have you know yours and buckle yourselves to it. And it may be (nay, it is) that your and mine will lead us to a common meeting-place, and that on a certain day we shall stand together, with many more beside us, ready for a greater adventure than any of us has yet had, a trial and a triumph to be endured and achieved in common.<ref name="Seán Cronin 1966, pg.15">Seán Cronin, Our Own Red Blood, Irish Freedom Press, New York, 1966, pg.15</ref>
}}

The Home Rule Bill just failed to pass the [[House of Lords]], but the Lords' diminished power under the [[Parliament Act 1911]] meant that the Bill could only be delayed, not stopped. It was placed on the statute books with [[Royal Assent]] in September 1914, but its implementation was suspended for the duration of the First World War.

John Redmond feared that his "national authority" might be circumvented by the Volunteers and decided to try to take control of the new movement. Despite opposition from the Irish Republican Brotherhood, the Volunteer Executive agreed to share leadership with Redmond and a joint committee was set up. Pearse was opposed to this and was to write:<ref name="Seán Cronin 1966, pg.15"/>

{{quote|The leaders in Ireland have nearly always left the people at the critical moment; they have sometimes sold them. The former Volunteer movement was abandoned by its leaders; [[Daniel O'Connell|O'Connell]] recoiled before the cannon at [[Daniel O'Connell#Campaign for repeal of the Union|Clontarf]]; twice the hour of the Irish revolution struck during [[Young Ireland]] days and twice it struck in vain, for [[Thomas Francis Meagher|Meagher]] hesitated in [[Waterford]], [[Charles Gavan Duffy|Duffy]] and [[Thomas D'Arcy McGee|McGee]] hesitated in Dublin. [[James Stephens (Fenian)|Stephens]] refused to [[James Stephens (Fenian)#Arrest and suppression|give the word in '65]]; he never came in '66 or '67. I do not blame these men; you or I might have done the same. It is a terrible responsibility to be cast on a man, that of bidding the cannon speak and the [[grapeshot]] pour.<ref name="Seán Cronin 1966, pg.15"/>}}

The Volunteers split, one of the issues being support for the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] and British war effort. A majority followed Redmond into the [[National Volunteers]] in the belief that this would ensure Home Rule on their return. Pearse, exhilarated by the dramatic events of the European war, wrote in an article in December 1915:

{{quote|It is patriotism that stirs the people. Belgium defending her soil is heroic, and so is Turkey   . . . . . . <br>It is good for the world that such things should be done. The old heart of the earth needed to be warmed with the red wine of the battlefields.<br> Such august homage was never before offered to God as this, the homage of millions of lives given gladly for love of country.<ref>"Peace and the Gael", in Patrick H.

By 1915 he was on the IRB's Supreme Council, and its secret Military Council, the core group that began planning for a rising while war raged on the European [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].

On 1 August 1915 Pearse gave a [[Ireland unfree shall never be at peace|graveside oration]] at the funeral of the [[Fenian]] [[Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa]]. He was the first republican to be filmed giving an oration.<ref>{{Cite book |title=16 Lives: Patrick Pearse |page=121}}</ref> It closed with the words:

{{quote|Our foes are strong and wise and wary; but, strong and wise and wary as they are, they cannot undo the miracles of God who ripens in the hearts of young men the seeds sown by the young men of a former generation. And the seeds sown by the young men of '65 and [[Fenian Rising (1867)|'67]] are coming to their miraculous ripening today. Rulers and Defenders of the Realm had need to be wary if they would guard against such processes. Life springs from death; and from the graves of patriot men and women spring living nations. The Defenders of this Realm have worked well in secret and in the open. They think that they have pacified Ireland. They think that they have purchased half of us and intimidated the other half. They think that they have foreseen everything, think that they have provided against everything; but, the fools, the fools, the fools! – They have left us our Fenian dead, and while Ireland holds these graves, Ireland unfree shall never be at peace.

==Easter Rising and death==
{{Main|Easter Rising}}
It was Pearse who, on behalf of the IRB shortly before Easter in 1916, issued the orders to all Volunteer units throughout the country for three days of manoeuvres beginning on Easter Sunday, which was the signal for a general uprising. When [[Eoin MacNeill]], the Chief of Staff of the Volunteers, learned what was being planned without the promised arms from Germany, he countermanded the orders via newspaper, causing the IRB to issue a last-minute order to go through with the plan the following day, greatly limiting the numbers who turned out for the rising.

When the [[Easter Rising]] eventually began on Easter Monday, 24 April 1916, it was Pearse who read the [[Proclamation of the Irish Republic]] from outside the [[General Post Office (Dublin)|General Post Office]], the headquarters of the Rising. Pearse was the person most responsible for drafting the Proclamation, and he was chosen as President of the Republic.<ref>{{cite web|title=Patrick Pearse|url=http://www.rte.ie/centuryireland/index.php/articles/patrick-pearse|website=Century Ireland|publisher=[[RTÉ]]/[[Boston College]]|access-date=1 March 2017|archive-date=2 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302112451/http://www.rte.ie/centuryireland/index.php/articles/patrick-pearse|url-status=live}}</ref> After six days of fighting, heavy civilian casualties and great destruction of property, Pearse issued the order to surrender.

Pearse and fourteen other leaders, including his brother Willie, were [[court-martial]]led and [[execution by firing squad|executed by firing squad]]. [[Tom Clarke (Irish republican)|Thomas Clarke]], [[Thomas MacDonagh]] and Pearse himself were the first of the rebels to be executed, on the morning of 3 May 1916. Pearse was 36 years old at the time of his death. [[Roger Casement]], who had tried unsuccessfully to recruit an insurgent force among Irish-born prisoners of war from the [[16th (Irish) Division|Irish Brigade]] in Germany, was hanged in London the following August.

[[John Maxwell (general)|Sir John Maxwell]], the General Officer commanding the British forces in Ireland, sent a telegram to [[H. H. Asquith]], then Prime Minister, advising him not to return the bodies of the Pearse brothers to their family, saying, "Irish sentimentality will turn these graves into martyrs' shrines to which annual processions will be made, which would cause constant irritation in this country.<ref name="P.H.

==Writings==
[[File:statue padraig pearse.jpg|thumb|upright|Bust of Pearse in [[Tralee]], County Kerry]]
Pearse wrote stories and poems in both Irish and English. His best-known English poems include "The Mother", "The Fool", "[[The Rebel (poem)|The Rebel]]" and "The Wayfarer".<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Mercier Companion to Irish literature |author=Seán McMahon and Jo O'Donoghue |year=1998 |publisher=[[Mercier Press]] |location=Cork |isbn=1-85635-216-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/merciercompanion00mcma/page/183 183] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/merciercompanion00mcma/page/183 }}</ref> He also wrote several [[allegorical]] plays in the [[Irish language]], including ''The King'', ''The Master'', and ''The Singer''.

He also wrote many essays on politics and language, notably "The Coming Revolution" and "Ghosts".

Pearse is closely associated with his rendering of the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] song, "[[Oró Sé do Bheatha 'Bhaile]]", for which he composed republican lyrics.

According to poet [[Louis de Paor]], Patrick Pearse was "the most perceptive [[literary critic|critic]] and most accomplished poet," of the early [[Gaelic revival]] providing "a sophisticated model for a new literature in Irish that would reestablish a living connection with the pre-colonial Gaelic past while resuming its relationship with contemporary Europe, bypassing the monolithic influence of English."<ref>[[Louis De Paor]] (2016), ''Leabhar na hAthghabhála: Poems of Repossession: Irish-English Bilingual Edition'', [[Bloodaxe Books]]. Page 20.</ref>

==Reputation==
Largely as a result of a series of political pamphlets that Pearse wrote in the months leading up to the Rising, he soon became recognised as the main voice of the Rising.{{Citation needed|date=August 2021}} In the middle decades of the 20th century, Pearse was idolised by [[Irish nationalist]]s as the supreme idealist of their cause.{{Citation needed|date=August 2021}} With the outbreak of conflict in [[Northern Ireland]] in 1969, Pearse's legacy was used by the [[Provisional IRA]].

Pearse's ideas have been seen by Sean Farrell Moran as belonging to the context of European cultural history as a part of a rejection of [[reason]] by European social thinkers.<ref>Sean Farrell Moran, "Patrick Pearse and the European Revolt Against Reason," Journal of the History of Ideas, 1989, 4.</ref> Additionally, his place within Catholicism, where his orthodoxy was challenged in the early 1970s,<ref>Francis J. Shaw, S.J., "The Canon of Irish History—A Challenge," in Studies, 61, 242, 115–53</ref> has been addressed to suggest that Pearse's theological foundations for his political ideas share in a long-existing tradition in western Christianity.<ref>Moran, "Patrick Pearse and Patriotic Soteriology" in The Irish Terrorism Experience, eds. Yonah Alexander and Alan O'Day, 1991, 9–29</ref>

Former [[Taoiseach]] [[Bertie Ahern]] described Pearse as one of his heroes and displayed a picture of Pearse over his desk in the [[Department of the Taoiseach]].<ref>Bertie Ahern, interviewed about Pearse on [[RTÉ]], 9 April 2006.</ref>

Pearse's mother [[Margaret Pearse]] served as a [[Teachta Dála|TD]] in [[Dáil Éireann]] in the 1920s. His sister [[Margaret Mary Pearse]] also served as a TD and [[Seanad Éireann|Senator]].

In a 2006 book, psychiatrists [[Michael Fitzgerald (psychiatrist)|Michael Fitzgerald]] and Antoinette Walker speculated that Pearse had [[Asperger syndrome]].<ref name="Fitzgerald and Walker">{{Cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/rebel-pearse-was-no-gay-blade-but-had-autistic-temperment-26410577.html |title=Rebel Pearse was no gay blade but had autistic temperment &#91;sic&#93; |last=Collins |first=Liam |date=9 April 2006 |access-date=28 January 2019 |archive-date=16 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181116112137/https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/rebel-pearse-was-no-gay-blade-but-had-autistic-temperment-26410577.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Pearse's apparent "sexual immaturity", and some of his behaviour, has been the subject of comment since the 1970s by historians such as [[Ruth Dudley Edwards]], T.

Pearse; Fanatic Heart |medium=television documentary |time=42:23 |location=Dublin |publisher=[[RTÉ]]}}</ref>

In almost all of Pearse's portraits he struck a sideways pose, concealing his left side. This was to hide a [[strabismus]] or squint in his left eye, which he felt was an embarrassing condition.<ref>John Spain, [http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/pearses-heroic-sideways-pose-he-did-it-to-hide-embarrassing-squint-29524364.html "Pearse's heroic sideways pose?

Cullenswood House, the Pearse family home in Ranelagh where Pádraic first founded St Enda's, today houses a primary ''Gaelscoil'' (school for education through the Irish language) called Lios na nÓg, part of a community-based effort to revive the Irish language. [[Crumlin, Dublin|Crumlin]] (Dublin) has the Pearse College of Further Education, and there was formerly an Irish language summer school in [[Gaoth Dobhair]] called Colaiste an Phiarsaigh. In [[Rosmuc]] there is an Irish-medium vocational school, Gairmscoil na bPiarsach. The main lecture hall at the Cadet School in Ireland is named after P.H. Pearse.  In September 2014, Gaelcholáiste an Phiarsaigh, a new Irish language medium secondary school, opened its doors for the first time in the former Loreto Abbey buildings, just 1&nbsp;km from the Pearse Museum in St Endas Park, Rathfarnham.
