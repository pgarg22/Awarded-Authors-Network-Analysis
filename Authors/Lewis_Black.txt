Every college he applied to except Georgetown rejected him, but by that point he had decided he did not want to go there, so he attended the [[University of Maryland, College Park]] for one year before transferring to the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]. There, he studied playwriting and was a brother of [[Pi Lambda Phi]] International [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] and a member of Student Congress.<ref>{{cite news|title=Arts – Back in Black|first=Nick |last=Parker |date=February 7, 2002 |newspaper=[[Daily Tar Heel]]|location=University of North Carolina |url=http://www.dailytarheel.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2002/02/07/3c6289dbc0b6c?in_archive=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030220174555/http://www.dailytarheel.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2002/02/07/3c6289dbc0b6c?in_archive=1 |archive-date=2003-02-20}}</ref> After graduating in 1970, he returned to Washington, where he worked at the [[Appalachian Regional Commission]], wrote plays, and performed stand-up comedy at the [[Brickskeller]] in [[Dupont Circle]].<ref name= rage/>

Black's career began in theater as a playwright; however, he has stated that he was always doing stand-up "on the side."<ref>{{Citation|title=LEWIS BLACK describes life on the road, groupies, and The Daily Show's humble beginnings|url=https://open.spotify.com/episode/61J7JNIxpckXqXujEWhoM3|language=en|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref> He served as the playwright-in-residence and associate artistic director of Steve Olsen's [[West Bank Cafe Downstairs Theatre Bar]] in [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] in New York City, where he collaborated with composer and lyricist [[Rusty Magee]] and artistic director Rand Foerster on hundreds of one-act plays from 1981 to 1989. Also with Rusty Magee, Black wrote the musical ''The Czar of Rock and Roll'', which premiered at Houston's [[Alley Theatre]] in 1990. Black's stand-up comedy began as an opening act for the plays; he was also the [[Master of Ceremonies|master of ceremonies]]. After a management change at the theater, Black left and began working as a comedian, as well as finding bit parts in television and films.

==Comedic style==
Black lists his comedic influences as [[George Carlin]], [[Lenny Bruce]], [[Richard Pryor]], [[Lily Tomlin]], [[Bob Newhart]] and [[Shelley Berman]].<ref name="Gillette1">{{cite web|url=http://origin.avclub.com/content/node/49217 |title=Interview: Lewis Black |publisher=[[The Onion]] |work=[[The A.V.

==Career==
===Stand-up comedy===
In 1998, Black starred in his first comedy special on the series ''[[Comedy Central Presents]].'' He starred in two additional episodes of the series in 2000 and 2002. He starred in another special for the network in 2002, titled ''Taxed Beyond Belief''. In 2004 and 2005, Black hosted the [[Stupidity (film)#Marketing and related works|World Stupidity Awards]] ceremony at Montreal's [[Just for Laughs]] comedy festival. In 2004, he had an [[HBO]] stand-up special titled ''[[Black on Broadway]].'' Black hosted [[Comedy Central]]'s ''Last Laugh '07'', which aired on December 2, 2007 along with [[Dave Attell]] and [[D.L. Hughley]].

In 2006, Black performed at the [[Warner Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|Warner Theatre]] in Washington, D.C. for an [[HBO]] special, ''Red, White, and Screwed''. It aired in June and a DVD was released in October. When explaining his choice of venue, Black said that "some asshole" was paid to count the number of times the word "fuck" was said in his previous HBO special, ''Black On Broadway'', and that the original location, the [[Kennedy Center]], wanted him to cut back on its use. Black was told the number was 42, when actually it was approximately 78.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Black received a 2007 Grammy award for "Best Comedy Album" for his album ''[[The Carnegie Hall Performance]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/Grammy_Awards/49th_show/list.aspx#20 |title=Grammy Awards |publisher=Grammy.com |date=September 30, 2006 |access-date=2010-11-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20061220160454/http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/49th_Show/list.aspx |archive-date=December 20, 2006 }}</ref> He hosted the [[Comedy Central]] television series ''[[The Root of All Evil (TV show)|The Root of All Evil]]'' in 2008. The show pitted two people or pop-culture topics against each other as a panel of comedians argued, in the style of a court trial, which is more evil, e.g., "[[Paris Hilton]] vs. [[Dick Cheney]]" and "Internet Porn vs. YouTube". After hearing arguments from both sides, Black, acting as judge, made the final decision as to which is more evil.<ref>[http://tv.ign.com/articles/825/825095p1.html "Comedy Central Gets Angry With Lewis Black"].

[[Comedy Central]]'s "Stand-Up Month" in 2008 featured specials originally presented on [[HBO]] by Black, along with programs featuring [[Dane Cook]] and [[Chris Rock]].  That year, as part of [[Comedy Central]]'s "Stand-Up Month", Black's routine finished at #5 on "Stand-Up Showdown 2008", a viewer-based countdown of the top Comedy Central Presents routine. In 2009, Black filmed two shows at the [[The Fillmore Detroit|Fillmore Theater in Detroit]], Michigan. These were the basis for the concert film ''Stark Raving Black'', which appeared in theaters for a limited time in October, and was released on video the next year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lewisblack.com/news.aspx |title=News |publisher=Lewisblack.com |access-date=2010-11-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031162146/http://lewisblack.com/news.aspx |archive-date=2010-10-31 }}</ref> At the end of 2009, Black returned to the History Channel to host ''Surviving the Holidays with Lewis Black'', in which he discussed the year-end pressures of Thanksgiving, Channukah, Christmas, and New Year's.

===Film and television career===
[[File:Black, Lewis (USGov).jpg|thumb|Black in 2007 at "Stand Up for Heroes"]]
Black appeared in episode 25 "Aria" (1991) of ''Law and Order'' as porn director Franklin Frome, ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' episode "Obscene" (2004) as a [[shock jock]],  and in ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'' episode "[[The Jiminy Conjecture]]" (2009) as Professor Crawley, an [[entomology|entomologist]]. He also released his autobiography, ''[[Nothing's Sacred (book)|Nothing's Sacred]]'', in 2005. Since November 9, 2005, Black has been making appearances in small segments on ''[[The Weather Channel (United States)|The Weather Channel]].'' In December 2005, he appeared in an animated holiday special ''[[The Happy Elf]]'', as the voice of the extremely tightly wound elf, Norbert.

In the film ''[[Accepted]]'', a film about high school graduates who create a college when they fail to get accepted into any, he played Dean Ben Lewis of the school "South Harmon Institute of Technology". He also appeared in the 2006 films ''[[Man of the Year (2006 film)|Man of the Year]]'' and ''[[Unaccompanied Minors]]''. Black hosted [[Comedy Central]]'s ''Last Laugh '06'', which aired on December 10, 2006.

Black was also the voice of "Manobrain" during the third season of the Cartoon Network series ''[[Duck Dodgers (TV series)|Duck Dodgers]]''. He was the inventor of a diet pill which was stolen while he was in college. He blamed the theft on his college friend Dr. I. Q. Hi, not realizing that the actual thief was Duck Dodgers. The theft set Manobrain on the path of evil.

Black provided the voice of the Deadly Duplicator in four episodes of the [[Adult Swim]] show ''[[Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law]]'' and in the [[Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law (video game)|video game based on the show]].

Black provided the voice of [[oxpecker]] Ted in the ''[[My Gym Partner's a Monkey]]'' episode, "Hornbill and Ted's Bogus Journey". The character is portrayed in the same fashion as his comedy shows, though without profanity. In addition, the bird's clothes, looks, and mannerisms resemble his. He also voiced Mr. E/Ricky Owens in ''[[Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated]]'' and for ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 TV series)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' played a middle-aged man named Vic who is kidnapped by the Krang and mutated into a spider-like monster called "Spider-Bytez" by Michelangelo. He also voiced Anger in the [[Pixar]] film ''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]''. He also guest starred as the voice of [[Santa Claus]] in the ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' episode, "Goons on the Moon."

===Tours===
On June 18, 2007, he sat in with [[Southern rock]]/[[Jam band]] [[Gov't Mule]] at the 6th annual [[Bonnaroo]] music festival, where he had performed earlier that weekend, for what was to be a quick joke. A member of the audience threw a bottle at Black, which [[bottling (concert abuse)|struck him]]. Black was upset and he encouraged the audience to boo the heckler before leaving the stage in disgust, while shouting obscenities at the heckler. This act was seen in an episode of ''[[Lewis Black's Root of All Evil]]'' titled "YouTube vs. [[Pornography|Porn]]".

On June 29, 2007, Black gave a benefit show at [[Springbrook High School]], his alma mater, in the school's auditorium for 1,100 alumni, faculty, and students. He performed in his usual style, stopping at points to remark how good it felt to use that language on that particular stage. At the end of the show he was given a Springbrook football jersey, and cursed at one teacher for giving him a B and causing him not to graduate first in his class.

In mid-December 2007, Black went with [[Robin Williams]], [[Kid Rock]], [[Lance Armstrong]] and [[Rachel Smith]], Miss USA 2007, on a [[United Service Organizations]] trip to support the troops in [[Iraq]] and [[Kuwait]]. The last show was on 22 December at the U.S Naval Station in Rota, Spain. In 2008, Black went on tour to promote his book ''Me of Little Faith''.<ref>Eberhart, John Mark (May 29, 2008).

Beginning in January 2010, Black embarked on a new tour called "In God We Rust".{{fact|date=January 2020}}

== Legal issues ==
In 2000, Black and fellow comedian [[Jim Norton (comedian)|Jim Norton]] were arrested for their involvement with "The Naked Teen Voyeur Bus",<ref>Trunk, Russell A. [http://www.annecarlini.com/ex_interviews.php?id=587 "Lewis Black: The Carnegie Hall Performance"] ([[Anne Carlini]]) website.</ref> a specially designed bus with [[acrylic glass]] walls containing numerous 18- and 19-year-old topless women. This bus was driven around [[Manhattan]] while reports about it were broadcast on the ''[[Opie and Anthony]]'' radio show.<ref name=":0" /> The radio station management did not inform the O&A show that the bus's route was also the route that President Clinton was using that day. Twenty-eight hours after their arrest, Black and Norton were released. Black appeared on ''[[The Daily Show]]'' the following night where he stated he was exercising his constitutional rights. He then joked that the location of this particular right was unclear, but that it was "between 'all men are created equal' and 'don't shit where you eat.'{{-"}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cc.com/video-clips/ajvhzw/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-back-in-black---jail-time|title=Back in Black – Jail Time |format=video |date=December 6, 2000| publisher=The Daily Show}}</ref>
