Ferenc Istvan Dénes Gyula Békássy was born to Istvan Békássy and Emma Bezeredj in the family mansion at [[Zsennye]] in [[Vas County]], western Hungary. He and his five siblings were sent to [[Bedales School]] for a progressive English education.<ref>Kenneth McRobbie, "Under the Sign of the pendulum: Childhood Experience as Determining Revolutionary Consciousness. Ilona Duczynska Polanyi", ''Canadian Journal of History'', Autumn 2006</ref>

After six years at Bedales, in 1911 he entered [[King's College, Cambridge]] as a [[Pensioner#Other uses|pensioner]] to read History. At [[Cambridge University]] his friends included [[James Strachey]], [[E. L. Grant Watson]], and especially [[John Maynard Keynes]], who went to stay with him in Hungary during the summer of 1913. He was elected a member of the [[Cambridge Apostles]], the semi-secret debating club.<ref>[[William C. Lubenow]], ''The Cambridge Apostles, 1820–1914''</ref> He and [[Rupert Brooke]] courted the same woman, [[Noël Olivier]], whom Békássy had known from Bedales.<ref name=Hung>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hungarianquarterly.com/no199/12.shtml |title=''Hungarian Quarterly''; Vol. LI, No. 199, Autumn 2010 |access-date=17 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712231603/http://www.hungarianquarterly.com/no199/12.shtml |archive-date=12 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

He wrote poetry in both [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and in English. Some of his English poems appeared in a Cambridge anthology in 1913. The Hungarian poems were only published posthumously.<ref name=Hung/>

He served in a [[Hussar]] unit and four days after arriving on the Eastern Front, he was [[killed in action]] against the Russians in [[Bukovina]] on 22 June 1915.<ref>Michael Copp, ''Cambridge Poets of the Great War: An Anthology'', p. 236</ref> His body was brought back to the family estate for burial.<ref>[http://www.bdmk.hu/emlekhelyek/Emlekhelyek_html/Zsennye.htm "Zsennye" (in Hungarian)]</ref>

[[File:BekassyF at Kings.jpg|thumb|right|Memorial cut into the stonework of [[King's College Chapel, Cambridge]]]]

In a side chapel at [[King's College Chapel, Cambridge|King's College Chapel]] there is a plaque commemorating members of the college killed serving in the Great War, including Rupert Brooke. Carved into the stone of another wall there is a single name, that of Békássy. Keynes had asked the college to include him among those commemorated but another of the Fellows of King's, who had lost a son in the war, objected to the name of someone who had died fighting the Allies being listed with the other fallen.<ref name=Hung/>

A collection of his poems in English, edited by [[F. L. Lucas]], was published in 1925 by [[Leonard Woolf|Leonard]] and [[Virginia Woolf]]'s [[Hogarth Press]].<ref>John H. Willis, ''Leonard and Virginia Woolf as Publishers: The Hogarth Press, 1917–41'', p. 141</ref>
