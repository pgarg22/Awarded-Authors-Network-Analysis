== Early life ==
Boone was born in the [[Bedford–Stuyvesant, Brooklyn|Bedford–Stuyvesant]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]] to Elliott W. Boone Sr., a [[United States Postal Service]] employee, and Thelma Boone (née Strothers).<ref name=NYTimes-FootMessengerProfile-2009 /><ref name=NYDailyNews-AsphaltWarrior-2010>{{cite news|last1=DeJohn|first1=Irving|title=Messenger of literary hope Courier delivers streetwise memoir|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/messenger-literary-hope-article-1.466502|work=[[New York Daily News]]|date=27 July 2010}}</ref>

Boone graduated from [[Andrew Jackson High School (Queens)|Andrew Jackson High School]] in the [[Cambria Heights, Queens|Cambria Heights]] neighborhood of [[Queens]] in [[New York City]]. In high school, Boone was on the track team and basketball team.<ref name=NYPost-AsphaltWarrior-2011 />

Boone attended [[LaGuardia Community College]]. He graduated from [[Los Angeles City College]] with a degree in business administration.

== Career ==
Boone started writing poetry in his first year at [[LaGuardia Community College]]. He worked as a sports reporter for [[York College, City University of New York|York College]]'s ''Pandora Box'' and [[Los Angeles City College]]'s ''Los Angeles Collegian'' newspapers.

The first book he ever wrote was for the Yale Series of Younger Poet Contest. He did not win but the contest inspired him to write more books.

In 1990, Boone began working as a New York City [[Courier|foot messenger]] for Rapid Messenger Service. Working as a messenger, delivering and picking up packages either by foot or by bike, was a common occupation for many former high school track stars at that time. Boone is classified as a "metro" messenger, which means he delivers and picks up packages by foot using the [[New York City]] [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA)]] service. Metro is short for MTA. Boone became known for being one of the fastest foot messengers in New York City.<ref name=NYDailyNews-OnTheSubway-2007>{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Lynsey|title=His message is delivered - in a new book|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/message-delivered-new-book-article-1.227135|work=[[New York Daily News]]|date=2 October 2007}}</ref>

While working as a foot messenger and riding the subway on the jobs that are typically less than an hour, Boone writes poetry that is influenced by his travels and encounters with people.<ref name=NYDailyNews-OnTheSubway-2007 /><ref name=Metro-AsphaltWarrior-2011>{{cite news|last1=Bowen|first1=Alison|title=60 seconds with ... the Delivery Man|url=http://www.metro.us/local/60-seconds-with-the-delivery-man/tmWkcC---28KMsGfckfpNs/|work=Metro|date=29 March 2011}}</ref>

Boone started to become known as a fast courier and talented poet, performing poetry at many New York City events. That eventually led him to produce his first book of poems, ''Looking For Myself'', which was published in 1996. By that time he had left Rapid Messenger Service in 1994.

In addition in the 1990s he was also be a sales representative for the ''Quarterly Black Review of Books'' and later a marketing representative for the [[Harlem Book Fair]], a division of ''QBR''. In 2000, he again went back into messenger work, but this time he would document his experiences in books and videos.

Since 2000 in his 12 years as a messenger, he has been reported upon in the media and made the cover of ''Courier Magazine'', with the front headline: "Nobody knows The Gritty Streets of NYC better than Kurt Boone."<ref name=CourierMag-FootSoldier-2010>{{cite news|last1=Brennan|first1=Vincent|title=Foot Soldier: Nobody Knows the Gritty Streets of NYC Better Than Kurt Boone|url=http://www.couriermagazine.com/Content.asp?CID=133&offset=6|work=Courier Magazine|date=July–August 2010}}</ref>

Feature stories about Boone have been published in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[New York Daily News]]'', ''[[New York Post]]'' and ''[[Metro New York]]''. Boone's writing work has also led to opportunities in film and video. He appears in ''Verse: A Murder Mystery'' (2011), ''Career Courier: The Labor Of Love'' (2011) and produced ''The Messenger Poet Show'' (2011), a web television series.

In total, Boone worked at Rapid Messenger Service, Excel Messenger Service, Kangaroo Courier and Mobile Messenger Service – all based in New York City.

Boone's four books of poetry are a loose collection that he calls his messenger poetry series, which documents stories about messengers in verse form, in poetry.<ref name=CourierStreet-MessengersNYC-2015>{{cite news|last1=Boone|first1=Kurt (moderator)|title=Messengers and New York City: A Roundtable Discussion|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubYzpRJfkoI|publisher=Courier Street Films|date=18 April 2015|location=Book Culture, New York City|format=Video}}</ref>

Boone's 2016 book, ''Subway Beats: Celebrating New York City Buskers,'' features over 250 musicians in approximately 30 subway stations. It took him over three years to compile and complete the book, which he documented on an online blog.<ref name=SpectrumNews-SubwayBeats-2016>{{cite news|last1=Martinez|first1=Jose|title=In Transit 11/4/16|url=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/in-transit/2016/11/5/in-transit-11-4-16.html|work=[[Spectrum News]]|date=4 November 2016|format=Video|quote=Interview starts at 6:00}}</ref><ref name=SubwayBeats-Blog-2016>{{cite news|last1=Boone|first1=Kurt|title=Subway Beats|url=https://subwaybeats.com/|work=Subway Beats (blog)|date=2016}}</ref>
