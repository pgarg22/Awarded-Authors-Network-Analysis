[[Pope Pius II]] wrote that Pannonius was of Slavonian origin (''de origine Slavonica''). His biographer and friend [[Vespasiano da Bisticci]] said that he was of Slavic nationality. According to Ronsano of Palermo, he was from Dalmatia (''di natione Dalmata''). M. Franičević, in citing Ronsano, notes that many Italians saw all “Croats” as Dalmatians. Ludovik Tuberon Crijević, writing of Pannonius, says that he was born a Slav (''genere itidem Sclavenum'') in that part of interior Dalmatia that lies between the Sava and Drava rivers.{{sfn|V. A.

Pannonius was brought up by his mother; in 1447 his uncle sent him to Italy for a [[Renaissance Humanism|humanist]] schooling. He attended the School of [[Guarino da Verona]] at [[Ferrara]], where the pupils were educated in Latin and Greek authors under the guidance of a noted teacher of the [[Italian Renaissance]]. The boy was considered the brightest pupil of his generation by both his teachers and fellow-students. He wrote poetry according to the rules of classical prosody; he was around thirteen when he wrote his first epigrams. His higher education was completed at the [[University of Padua]] in canon law.<ref name="Jugoslovenski književni leksikon">{{cite book |author=Milorad Živančević |editor = Živan Milisavac |date=1971 |title=Jugoslovenski književni leksikon |trans-title=Yugoslav Literary Lexicon |publisher=[[Matica srpska]] |language=sh |location= [[Novi Sad]] ([[Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina|SAP Vojvodina]], [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|SR Serbia]]) |page=70 }}</ref> After making an educational tour of Rome, he returned to Hungary in 1458, the year of [[Matthias Corvinus|Matthias's]] accession to the throne.

For a time, he worked at the Royal Chancery, and soon was appointed as the [[Bishop of Pécs]] and later Vice-Chancellor of the country. Janus Pannonius was an influential intellectual in the kingdom; he kept his connections with some of the leading philosophers of his time. He also collected a significant library of humanist works (probably dispersed in 1526).<ref name=staikos2012>{{Citation |isbn = 9781584561828 |publication-place = New Castle, DE |publisher= Oak Knoll Press |year= 2012 |title = History of the Library in Western Civilization: From Petrarch to Michelangelo |author = Konstantinos Staikos }}</ref>
