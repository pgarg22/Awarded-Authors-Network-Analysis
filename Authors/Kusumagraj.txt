==Early life and education==
Kusumagraj (विष्णु वामन शिरवाडकर / कुसुमाग्रज) was born शिरवाडे वणी shirwade vani Nashik into a [[Deshastha Brahmin]] family <ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AsU7R69gqDIC|title=The Illustrated Weekly of India, Volume 95|publisher=Bennett, Coleman & Company, Limited, at the Times of India Press|page=31|year=1974|quote=Marathi literature is strewn with Deshastha writers.

Banhatti, V. K. Gokak and Mugali all belong to this community.}}</ref> on 27 February 1912 in [[Nashik ] as Gajanan Ranganath Shirwadkar. He even published some of his poetry under this name in 1930s. Upon being adopted somewhat late in life in 1930s, his name was changed to Vishnu Waman Shirwadkar. He later adopted the sobriquet 'Kusumagraj'. He pursued his primary education in Pimpalgaon and high school education in the New English School of  Nashik, which is now called [[Rungta High School|J.S. Rungtha High School]] of Nashik. He passed matriculation from [[Mumbai University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kusumagraj.org/kusumagraj/parichay.php |title=Welcome to kusumagraj Pratishthan&nbsp;— Web Site of Kusumagraj / Vishnu Vaman Shirwadkar |website=Kusumagraj.org |access-date=2016-02-27}}</ref> In 1944, he married Manorama (née : Gangubai Sonawani) ; she died in 1972).<ref name="kusumagraj1">{{cite web|url=http://www.kusumagraj.org/kusumagraj/jivanpat.php |title=Welcome to kusumagraj Pratishthan&nbsp;— Web Site of Kusumagraj / Vishnu Vaman Shirwadkar |website=Kusumagraj.org |access-date=2016-02-27}}</ref>
He was associated with Rajaram College, Kolhapur. Noted critic Keshav Rangnath Shirwadkar (1926-2018) was his younger brother. <ref>https://maharashtratimes.com/maharashtra/nashik-north-maharashtra-news/nashik/k-r-shirwadkar-passed-away-brother-of-kusumagraj/articleshow/63467219.cms</ref>

==Career==
While Shirwadkar was at the H. P. T. College in [[Nashik]],<ref name="cafenasik1">{{cite web|url=http://www.cafenasik.com/entertainment-and-recreation/news/12020675-hpt-college-to-host-smaranrang.html |title=12020675-HPT College to Host 'Smaranrang' &#124; News |website=Cafenasik.com |date=2012-02-18 |access-date=2016-02-27}}</ref> his poems were published in the ''Ratnakar '' (रत्नाकर) magazine.<ref>[http://www.kusumagraj.org/kusumagraj/parichay.phphttp://www.kusumagraj.org/kusumagraj/jivanpat.php]{{dead link|date=February 2016}}</ref> In 1932, at the age of 20, Shirwadkar participated in a [[satyagraha]] to support the demand for allowing the entry of  the [[Dalit|untouchables]] in the [[Kalaram Temple]] at [[Nashik]].<ref name="kusumagraj1"/>

In 1933, Shirwadkar established the ''Dhruv Mandal'' (ध्रुव मंडळ ) and started writing in a newspaper called ''Nava Manu'' (नवा मनू). In the same year, his first collection of poems, ''Jeevanlahari'' (जीवन लहरी), was published.<ref name="kusumagraj1"/> In 1934, Shirwadkar obtained a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in Marathi and English languages, from the H. P. T. College in [[Nashik]].<ref name="cafenasik1"/>

Shirwadkar joined Godavari Cinetone Ltd. in 1936 and wrote the [[screenplay]] for the movie ''Sati Sulochana'' (सती सुलोचना). He also acted in the movie as Lord [[Lakshmana]].<ref>[http://www.nashik.com/dadasaheb-phalkehttp://www.kusumagraj.org/kusumagraj/jivanpat.php] {{dead link|date=February 2016}}</ref> However, the film failed to be a success.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nashik.com/dadasaheb-phalke |title=Dadasaheb Phalke&nbsp;— Nashik.com&nbsp;— A complete guide of Nashik city |website=Nashik.com |date=1913-05-03 |access-date=2016-02-27}}</ref>

He later worked as a journalist. He wrote in periodicals such as ''Saptahik Prabha'' (साप्ताहिक प्रभा), ''Dainik Prabhat'' (दैनिक प्रभात), ''Saarathi'' (सारथी), ''Dhanurdari'' (धनुर्धारी), and ''Navayug'' (नवयुग).  1942 was a turning point in the career of Kusumagraj, as the father-figure of Marathi literature, [[Vishnu Sakharam Khandekar]], published Kusumgraj's compilation of poetry, ''Vishakha'' (विशाखा) at his own expense, and in his preface describing Kusumagraj as a poet of humanity, wrote, "His words manifest the social discontent but retain the optimistic conviction that the old world was giving way to a new one."<ref name="ie"/> Its publication coincided with the [[Quit India Movement]], and carried the message of freedom and stood against slavery, and soon its words became popular with young men and women; in time it was to become his lasting legacy to Indian literature.<ref>{{cite book|last=Das|first=Sisir Kumar |title=History of Indian Literature: .1911–1956, struggle for freedom : triumph and tragedy (Volume 1) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sqBjpV9OzcsC&q=Kusumagraj&pg=PA58|year=1995|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=81-7201-798-7|page=90}}</ref>

After 1943, he started adapting the plays by literary giants like [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Moliere]], [[Maurice Maeterlinck]] and [[Shakespeare]], especially his tragedies, and which played an important role in boosting Marathi theatre of the period. This continued into the 1970s when his masterpiece ''Natsamrat'' , styled after Shakespeare's play [[King Lear]] , was first staged in 1970, with [[Sriram Lagoo]] as the lead.<ref name="ie"/> In 1946, he wrote his first novel ''Vaishnav'' (वैष्णव) and his first play ''Doorche Dive'' (दूरचे दिवे).<ref name="kusumagraj1"/> From 1946 to 1948, he also edited a weekly called ''Swadesh'' (स्वदेश).<ref name="kusumagraj1"/>

While temperamentally he ranged from reclusive to exclusive, he had a keen social sense and championed the cause of the downtrodden without involving himself in ground level activities. In 1950, he founded the Lokahitawādi Mandal (लोकहितवादी; organisation for social good) in Nashik which is still in existence. He also edited certain academic textbooks for school students.<ref name="kusumagraj1"/>

However, Kusumagraj's main claim to fame was as a poet and writer. In 1954, he adapted [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'' as ''Rajmukut'' (राजमुकुट), 'The Royal Crown' to Marathi. It starred Nanasaheb Phatak and [[Durga Khote]] ([[Lady Macbeth]]). He also adapted ''[[Othello]]'' in 1960.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://internetshakespeare.uvic.ca/Library/Criticism/shakespearein/india6.html |title=Shakespeare in India (6) :: Internet Shakespeare Editions |website=Internetshakespeare.uvic.ca |date=2006-06-07 |access-date=2016-02-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303185732/http://internetshakespeare.uvic.ca/Library/Criticism/shakespearein/india6.html |archive-date=3 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He also worked as a lyricist in [[Marathi cinema]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geetmanjusha.com/marathi/lyricswriter/49.html |title=कुसुमाग्रज - Kusumagraj&nbsp;— Marathi Lyricist Lyricswriter |website=Geetmanjusha.com |access-date=2016-02-27}}</ref>

His work reflected the changing social milieu, from being the reflection of national uprising during Indian freedom struggle and in the post-independence era it got steeped into rising social-consciousness amongst Marathi writers, which marked the advent of modern [[Dalit literature]].<ref name="ie">{{cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie/daily/19990313/iex13048.html|title=A master craftsman|last=Gohkale|first=Madhav|date=13 March 1999|work=Indian Express}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Shirwadkar was also an active participant in the [[Samyukta Maharashtra Movement]].<ref name="kusumagraj1"/>

In Marathi literature, Ajram created literary works. Or. It has come to light that many times more literature has been neglected than the published literature of Shirwadkar and Kusumagraj. 
While this neglected literature was in the city, neither the rulers nor the establishment established in the name of Kusumagraj wanted to take notice of it. Kusumagraj wrote extensively in all genres of Marathi literature. It includes all types of stories, poems, plays, one-act plays, children's literature.
Vs. Or. Before writing under the name Shirwadkar, Kusumagraj also wrote extensively under the name of Gajanan Ranganath Shirwadkar of Purvashram. However, only the literature published in the form of his book came before the public. Literary genres like essays, personifications, travelogues, children's poems written by him are still neglected and uncollected. In this literature 189 poems, 13 children's poems are ignored
