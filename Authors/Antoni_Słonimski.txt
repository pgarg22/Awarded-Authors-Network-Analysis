'''Antoni Słonimski''' (15 November 1895 – 4 July 1976) was a Polish poet, artist, journalist, playwright and [[prose]] writer, president of the [[Polish Writers' Union|Union of Polish Writers]] in 1956–1959 during the [[Polish October]], known for his devotion to social justice.

Słonimski was the grandson of [[Hayyim Selig Slonimski]], the founder of "[[ha-Tsefirah]]"- the first Hebrew weekly with an emphasis on the sciences. His father, an ophthalmologist, converted to Christianity when he married a Catholic woman. Słonimski was born in [[Warsaw]] and baptized and raised as a Christian.<ref name="Alfabet">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s0FFvzuC5hcC&pg=PA321&dq=%22Antony+Polonsky%22+%22Contemporary+Jewish+Writing+in+Poland%22+Slonimski#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Contemporary Jewish writing in Poland: an anthology | publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]] | year=2001 | accessdate=11 July 2011 | author=Antony Polonsky, Monika Adamczyk-Garbowska | page=321 | quote=Source: "Alfabet wspomnień" by Antoni Słonimski (memoir), [[Państwowy Instytut Wydawniczy|PIW]], 1975 | isbn=0-8032-3721-9}}</ref> Słonimski studied at the [[Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw]]. In 1919 he co-founded the ''[[Skamander]]'' group of experimental poets with [[Julian Tuwim]] and [[Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz]]. In 1924 he travelled to Palestine and Brasil and in 1932 to the Soviet Union.

Słonimski spent the [[World War II|war years]] in exile in England and France, returning to Poland in 1951. He worked as contributor to popular periodicals: ''Nowa Kultura'' (1950–1962), ''Szpilki'' (1953–73) and ''Przegląd Kulturalny''. He was an active anti-Stalinist and supporter of liberalization. In 1964 he was one of the signatories and the main author of the so-called [[Letter of 34]] to Prime Minister [[Józef Cyrankiewicz]] regarding freedom of culture. Słonimski died on 4 July 1976 in a car accident in Warsaw.
