While serving as Poet Laureate, Carolyn started the ''"Poetry Book Giveaway Project"'' and added the ''"Poets Spotlight"''<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.carolynforonda.com/archive.htm |title=''"Poet's Spotlight"'' at www.CarolynForonda.com |access-date=2011-06-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708122213/http://www.carolynforonda.com/archive.htm |archive-date=2011-07-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref> to her webpage highlighting one poet from the Commonwealth each month, in addition to traveling widely to promote poetry in every corner of Virginia.

Carolyn is an abstract colorist painter, and her paintings have been featured in solo exhibitions throughout northern, central, and eastern Virginia.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Carolyn Kreiter-Foronda was born in Central Virginia in 1946. She spent her youth in [[Crewe, Virginia|Crewe]], [[Pulaski, Virginia|Pulaski]], and [[Sandston, Virginia]]. As a young child, Carolyn avidly read poetry and wrote her first poem prior to entering elementary school. Encouraged by her parents, who were both educators, to hone her creative skills, she devoted hours to writing poetry and fiction. Her parents also influenced her decision to become an English and creative writing teacher. Her mother, Lucille Kreiter, was her teacher in fifth and sixth grades.  Her father, Victor Kreiter, Sr., was her high school principal at [[Highland Springs, Virginia|Highland Springs]] High School.  While attending high school, she developed an interest in journalism and became a staff member of the school newspaper, [[Highland Fling]]. She also served as a Youth Page correspondent for the ''[[Richmond News Leader]]'', the city's afternoon daily newspaper. She was inducted into [[Quill and Scroll]], [[National Honor Society]], and the [[Beta Club]]. She also belonged to the [[Interclub Council]] and [[Future Teachers of America]]. During her sophomore year she received a [[Citizenship Award]], and as a senior she was awarded a [[Future Teachers of America Scholarship]] and the [[Dr. Joseph Haven Hoge Memorial Scholarship]] for university study. Her parents encouraged her to attend Mary Washington College (now the [[University of Mary Washington]]), the women's division of the [[University of Virginia]].

A member of [[Hoofprints]], Carolyn won several first-place awards in horse shows and was selected a Reserve Champion, Intermediate Level, in the 1967 Spring Horse Show. During her senior year she served as President of the [[Student Education Association]] and as Vice-President of the [[Student Virginia Education Association]]. In 1969 she graduated with a B.A. in English ([[Mortar Board]]).  In 2008 she was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa ([[Kappa of Virginia]]) as an alumni member.

===Career and higher education===
In August 1969, Carolyn started her teaching career at [[West Springfield High School (Virginia)|West Springfield High School]] in [[Springfield, Virginia]]. While teaching full-time, she received a Master of Arts, a Master in Education, and a Ph.D. degree from [[George Mason University]], where she studied creative writing under the award-winning poets, [[Peter Klappert]] and [[Ai (poet)|Ai]].  In 1983, she was awarded the first doctorate presented by the school. She won a [[Scholarship and Service Award]] and a Letter of Recognition for Quality Research from the [[Virginia Educational Research Association]] for her dissertation, ''Gathering Light: A Poet's Approach to Poetry Analysis''. In 2007, she was named Alumna of the Year by both the University of Mary Washington and George Mason University.

===Retirement===

'''Educational''' - After retiring from a 31-year career in education, Carolyn developed a statewide poetry-in-the-schools program at the request of the [[Poetry Society of Virginia]] to promote poetry at all instructional levels (K-University). She co-edited with Edward W. Lull an instructional guide, entitled ''Four Virginia Poets Laureate: A Teaching Guide'' and secured grant funding to place copies of this book in various educational settings and libraries. She also led an effort through the Poetry Society of Virginia to fund an endowed poetry prize for deserving creative writing students at Virginia colleges and universities. To date, the College Prize, under the auspices of the Academy of American Poets, has been established at the [[College of William and Mary]], the [[University of Mary Washington]], [[Old Dominion University]], the [[University of Richmond]], and [[Virginia Tech]].

After being appointed Poet Laureate in July 2006, Carolyn launched a ''Poetry Book Giveaway Project''. [[White Pine Press]], [[University of Arkansas Press]], and the Poetry Society of Virginia have contributed books, poetry DVDs, and CDs to this effort. Carolyn has distributed these educational materials to universities and high schools throughout Virginia. She set up a ''Poet's Spotlight Page'' on her website (www.carolynforonda.com) to highlight the work of poets who have a strong Virginia connection. She devoted countless hours on the road giving poetry readings and workshops throughout the state. During her term as Poet Laureate, the [[Virginia State Board of Education]] honored her efforts with a [[Resolution of Appreciation]] for her recognition as Poet Laureate and for “her sustained leadership and devotion to promoting the writing and reading of poetry among Virginia's young people and to raising the study of the Arts to the highest level.”

'''Artistic''' - Carolyn also works as an abstract artist. She studied art for 17 years in northern Virginia under the award-winning painter, [[Irene Wood-Montgomery]]. Her paintings and sculpture have been exhibited in galleries, educational settings, and nursing homes throughout the state of Virginia. Carolyn is an [[abstract colorist]], whose preferred medium is [[acrylic paint|acrylic]]. Influenced by the non-representational style of [[Jackson Pollock]] and by the Washington, D.C. color field painter, [[Sam Gilliam]], Carolyn experiments with color effects to evoke an emotional response from the viewer. Inspired by the late work of [[Henri Matisse]], Carolyn creates textured cut-outs to achieve a representational effect.

===Personal life===
Carolyn and her husband reside in the River Country region of Virginia, where they have established a [[Backyard Wildlife Habitat]], certified by the [[National Wildlife Federation]]. During their leisure time, they enjoy kayaking, Latin dancing and American-style ballroom dancing.

==Published works==
Carolyn has written poetry, a teaching guide, news articles, book chapters, a booklet; and her work was included in the 2009 [[Rappahannock River|Rappahannock]] Art League Calendar which features 11 poems from ''River Country''.
