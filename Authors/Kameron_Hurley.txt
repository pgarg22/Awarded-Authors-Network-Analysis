Her first novel trilogy, the ''Bel Dame Apocrypha'', is what Hurley called "bugpunk": set on a far-future desert planet whose technology is based on insects and whose matriarchal, Islam-inspired cultures are locked in perpetual war. Her second trilogy, the ''Worldbreaker Saga'', is [[grimdark]] [[epic fantasy]] that aims to subvert the genre's tropes such as the [[hero's journey]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Moher|first1=Aidan|title=50,000 Shades of Grey: The Mirror Empire by Kameron Hurley|url=http://aidanmoher.com/blog/review/2015/02/50000-shades-grey/|access-date=5 May 2015|work=A Dribble of Ink|date=4 February 2015}}</ref> She has also published a standalone [[space opera]] novel, ''The Stars are Legion''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Saga Press to Publish Kameron Hurley's Standalone Space Opera The Stars Are Legion|url=http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/12/saga-press-kameron-hurley-the-stars-are-legion|access-date=5 May 2015|work=[[Tor.com]]|date=15 December 2015}}</ref>
