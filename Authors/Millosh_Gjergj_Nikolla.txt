'''Millosh Gjergj Nikolla''' ({{IPA-sq|miˈɫoʃ ɟɛˈrɟ niˈkoɫa}}; 13 October 1911{{snds}}26 August 1938), commonly known by the [[acronym]] [[pen name]] '''Migjeni''', was an [[Albanian people|Albanian]] poet and writer, considered one of the most important of the 20th century. After his death, he was recognized as one of the main influential writers of interwar [[Albanian literature]].

Migjeni is considered to have shifted from [[revolutionary]] [[romanticism]] to [[Critical realism (philosophy of perception)|critical realism]] during his lifetime. He wrote about the poverty of the years he lived in, with writings such as "Give Us This Day Our Daily Bread", "The Killing Beauty", "Forbidden Apple", "The Corn Legend", "Would You Like Some Charcoal?" etc., severely conveyed the indifference of the wealthy classes to the suffering of the people.

The proliferation of his creativity gained a special momentum after [[World War II]], when the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|communist regime]] took over the full publication of works, which in the 1930s had been partially unpublished.

== Biography ==
His surname derived from his grandfather Nikolla, who hailed from the region of [[Upper Reka]] from where he moved to Shkodër in the late 19th century where he practiced the trade of a bricklayer and later married Stake Milani from [[Kuči]], Montenegro, with whom he had two sons: Gjergj (Migjeni's father) and Kristo.{{sfn|Demo|2011}}{{sfn|Luarasi|Luarasi|2003|p=?}}

His grandfather was one of the signatories of the congress [[Orthodox Congress, Albania|for the establishment]] of the [[Orthodox Church of Albania]] in 1922. His mother Sofia Kokoshi{{sfn|Polet|2002|p=710}} (d. 1916), a native of [[Kavajë]],<ref>[https://m.gazetaexpress.com/mobile/arte/tre-shoke-migjeni-pano-e-driteroi-50064/?archive=1 Tre "shokë": Migjeni, Pano e Dritëroi]</ref> was educated at the [[Catholic seminary of Scutari]], run by Italian nuns.{{sfn|Luarasi|Luarasi|2003|p=?}} His maternal uncle Jovan Kokoshi taught at the Orthodox seminary in Bitola.<ref>[http://www.mapo.al/2014/10/tre-shoke-migjeni-pano-e-dritero Tre "shokë": Migjeni, Pano e Dritëroi]</ref> Milosh had a brother that died in infancy, and four sisters: Lenka, Jovanka, Cvetka and Olga.{{sfn|Demo|2011}}

Migjeni was born on 13 October 1911 in the town of [[Shkodër]] at the southeastern coast of [[Lake of Shkodër]].{{sfn|Elsie|2005|p=138}}{{sfn|Pipa|1978|p=134}}

=== Teaching, publishing and deteriorating health ===

On 23 April 1933, he was appointed teacher at a school in the village of Vrakë or<ref name="Admiralty1920">{{cite book|author=Great Britain. Admiralty|title=A Handbook of Serbia, Montenegro, Albania and Adjacent Parts of Greece|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3KVBAAAAYAAJ|year=1920|publisher=H.M.

It was during this period that he also began writing prose sketches and verses.<ref name="Elsie2005-132"/>

In May 1934 his first short prose piece, ''Sokrat i vuejtun apo derr i kënaqun'' (Suffering Socrates or a satisfied pig), was published in the periodical ''Illyria'', under his new pen name ''Migjeni'', an acronym of Millosh Gjergj Nikolla. Soon though, in the summer of 1935, the twenty-three-year-old Migjeni fell seriously ill with tuberculosis, which he had contracted earlier. He journeyed to [[Athens]], [[Greece]] in July of that year in hope of obtaining treatment for the disease which was endemic on the marshy coastal plains of Albania at the time but returned to Shkodra a month later with no improvement in his condition. In the autumn of 1935, he transferred for a year to a school in Shkodra itself and, again in the periodical Illyria, began publishing his first epoch-making poems.

In a letter of 12 January 1936 written to translator [[Skënder Luarasi]] (1900–1982) in [[Tirana]], Migjeni announced, "I am about to send my songs to press. Since, while you were here, you promised that you would take charge of speaking to some publisher, 'Gutemberg' for instance, I would now like to remind you of this promise, informing you that I am ready." Two days later, Migjeni received the transfer he had earlier requested to the mountain village of [[Pukë|Puka]] and on 18 April 1936 began his activities as the headmaster of the run-down school there.

The clear mountain air did him some good, but the poverty and misery of the [[mountain people]] in and around Puka were even more overwhelming than that which he had experienced among the inhabitants of the coastal plain. Many of the children came to school barefoot and hungry, and teaching was interrupted for long periods because of outbreaks of contagious diseases, such as [[measles]] and [[mumps]]. After eighteen difficult months in the mountains, the consumptive poet was obliged to put an end to his career as a teacher and as a writer, and to seek medical treatment in [[Turin]] in Northern Italy where his sister Ollga was studying mathematics. He set out from Shkodra on 20 December 1937 and arrived in Turin before Christmas Day. There he had hoped, after recovery, to register and study at the Faculty of Arts. The breakthrough in the treatment of tuberculosis, however, was to come a decade too late for Migjeni. After five months at San Luigi Sanatorium near Turin, Migjeni was transferred to the Waldensian hospital in [[Torre Pellice]] where he died on 26 August 1938. His demise at the age of twenty-six was a tragic loss for the modern Albanian letters.

The author had chosen the nom-de-plume Mi-Gje-Ni, an acronym formed by the first two letters each of his first name, patronymic and last name.

=== Poetry ===

[[File:Shkoder 035.JPG|thumb|upright|right|A bust of Migjeni in front of the [[Shkodër|Migjeni Theatre]] in [[Shkodër]].]]

His slender volume of verse (thirty-five poems) entitled ''Vargjet e Lira'' ("Free Verse") was printed by ''Gutenberg Press'' Publisher in [[Tirana]] in 1936, but was banned by government censorship. The second edition, published in 1944, was missing two old poems ''Parathanja e parathanjeve'' ("Preface of prefaces") and ''Blasfemi'' ("Blasphemy") that were deemed offensive, but it did include eight new ones. The main theme of Migjeni was misery and suffering, a reflection of the life he saw and lived.

Migjeni made a promising start as a [[prose]] writer. He is the author of about twenty-four short prose [[sketch (literature)|sketches]] which he published in periodicals for the most part between the spring of 1933 and the spring of 1938.

He possessed all the prerequisites for being a great poet. He had an inquisitive mind. Though his verse production was no more voluminous than his prose, his success in the field of poetry was no less than spectacular in Albania at the time.

The main [[Theme (literature)|theme]] of ''Free verse'', as with Migjeni's prose, is misery and [[suffering]]. It is a poetry of acute social awareness and despair. Previous generations of poets had sung the beauties of the Albanian mountains and the sacred traditions of the nation, whereas Migjeni now opened his eyes to the harsh realities of life, to the appalling level of misery, disease, and poverty he discovered all around him. He was a poet of despair who saw no way out, who cherished no hope that anything but death could put an end to suffering. ''"I suffer from the child whose father cannot buy him a toy. I suffer from a young man who burns with unslaked sexual desire. I suffer from the middle-aged man drowning in the apathy of life. I suffer from the old man who trembles at the prospect of death. I suffer from the peasant struggling with the soil. I suffer from the worker crushed by iron. I suffer from the sick suffering from all the diseases of the world... I suffer with man."'' Typical of the suffering and of the futility of human endeavor for Migjeni is ''Rezignata'' ("Resignation"), a poem in the longest cycle of the collection, ''Kangët e mjerimit'' ("Songs of poverty"). Here the poet paints a grim portrait of our earthly existence: somber nights, tears, smoke, thorns and mud. Rarely does a breath of fresh air or a vision of nature seep through the gloom. When nature does occur in the verse of Migjeni, then, of course, it is autumn.

[[File:Migjeni theatre.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Migjeni Theatre]] in [[Shkodër]].]]

If there is no [[hope]], there are at least suffocated desires and wishes. Some poems, such as ''Të birtë e shekullit të ri'' ("The sons of the new age"), ''Zgjimi'' ("Awakening"), ''Kanga e rinis'' ("Song of youth") and ''Kanga e të burgosunit'' ("The prisoner's song"), are assertively declamatory in a left-wing [[revolutionary]] manner. Here we discover Migjeni as a precursor of socialist verse or rather, in fact, as the zenith of genuine socialist verse in Albanian [[Letter (message)|letters]], long before the so-called liberation and [[History of Albania|socialist period]] from 1944 to 1990. Migjeni was, nonetheless, not a socialist or revolutionary poet in the political sense, despite the indignation and the occasional clenched fist he shows us. For this, he lacked the [[optimism]] as well as any sense of political commitment and activity. He was a product of the 1930s, an age in which Albanian intellectuals, including Migjeni, were particularly fascinated by the West and in which, in Western Europe itself, the rival ideologies of communism and fascism were colliding for the first time in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Migjeni was not entirely uninfluenced by the nascent philosophy of the right either. In ''Të lindet njeriu'' ("May the man be born") and particularly, in the ''Nietzschean dithyramb Trajtat e Mbinjeriut'' ("The shape of the Superman"), a strangled, crushed will transforms itself into "ardent desire for a new genius," for the [[Superman]] to come. To a [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] friend, [[André Stefi]], who had warned him that the communists would not forgive for such poems, Migjeni replied, ''"My work has a combative character, but for practical reasons, and taking into account our particular conditions, I must maneuver in disguise. I cannot explain these things to the [communist] groups, they must understand them for themselves. The publication of my works is dictated by the necessities of the social situation through which we are passing. As for myself, I consider my work to be a contribution to the union of the groups. André, my work will be achieved if I manage to live a little longer."''

[[File:Migjeni monument in Pukë, Albania.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A monument of Migjeni in [[Pukë]].]]

Part of the 'establishment' which he felt was oblivious to the sufferings of humanity was the [[Christian clergy|Church]]. Migjeni's religious education and his training for the Orthodox priesthood seem to have been entirely counterproductive, for he cherished neither an attachment to religion nor any particularly fond sentiments for the organized Church. God for Migjeni was a giant with granite fists crushing the will of man. Evidence of the repulsion he felt towards God and the Church are to be found in the two poems missing from the 1944 edition, ''Parathania e parathanieve'' ("Preface of prefaces") with its cry of desperation ''"God! Where are you?"'', and ''Blasfemi'' ("Blasphemy").

In ''Kanga skandaloze'' ("Scandalous song"), Migjeni expresses a [[morbid]] attraction to a pale nun and at the same time his defiance and rejection of her world. This poem is one which helps throw some light not only on Migjeni's attitude to religion but also on one of the least studied aspects in the life of the poet, his repressed sexuality.

[[Eroticism]] has certainly never been a prominent feature of Albanian literature at any period and one would be hard-pressed to name any Albanian author who has expressed his intimate impulses and desires in verse or prose. Migjenis verse and his prose abound with the figures of women, many of them unhappy prostitutes, for whom Migjeni betrays both pity and open sexual interest. It is the tearful eyes and the red lips which catch his attention; the rest of the body is rarely described. Passion and rapturous desire are ubiquitous in his verse, but equally present is the specter of physical intimacy portrayed in terms of disgust and sorrow. It is but one of the many bestial faces of misery described in the 105-line ''Poema e mjerimit'' ("The poem of the misery").

== Legacy ==

Though Migjeni did not publish a single book during his lifetime, his works, which circulated privately and in the press of the period, were an immediate success. Migjeni paved the way for modern literature in Albania and other Albanian speaking territories. This literature was, however, soon to be nipped in the bud. Indeed, the very year of the publication of ''Free Verse'' saw the victory of [[Stalinism]] in Albania and the proclamation of the People's Republic.

Many have speculated as to what contribution Migjeni might have made to Albanian letters had he managed to live longer. The question remains highly hypothetical, for this individualist voice of genuine social protest would no doubt have suffered the same fate as most Albanian writers of talent in the late 1940s, i.e. internment, imprisonment or execution. His early demise has at least preserved the writer for us undefiled.

The fact that Migjeni did perish so young makes it difficult to provide a critical assessment of his work. Though generally admired, Migjeni is not without critics. Some have been disappointed by his prose, nor is the range of his verse sufficient to allow us to acclaim him as a universal poet.
