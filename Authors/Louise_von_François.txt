François educated herself by reading the works of  [[Adolf Müllner]] and [[Fanny Tarnow]]. Her fathered died when she was young and her mother remarried multiple times. François' uncle took custody of her in Potsdam, where her writing career began.

Penniless, François moved back to live with her mother and step-father in Weissenfels where she stayed until her death.
