==Life==
Born in [[Aomori Prefecture]], he started writing in 1982 for ''SF Izumu'' magazine. Afterwards he collaborated on a number of published works. In 1988 he published his first novel, ''Summer Road'' (Natsukaidô-Samârôdo), followed by various other fantasy books, often set in large cities or characterized by a surreal streak.

Hayami also worked on a number of novelizations of [[science fiction]] or [[Horror fiction|horror]] [[manga]] and [[anime]]. In the latter field, his work on the tie-ins for the anime series ''[[Vampire Princess Miyu]]'' became so popular that the original characters and situations were in later entries of the series modified to account for his personal additions to the canon.
