'''Edward John Moreton Drax Plunkett, 18th Baron of Dunsany''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ʌ|n|ˈ|s|eɪ|n|i}}; 24 July 1878 – 25 October 1957, usually '''Lord Dunsany''') was an [[Anglo-Irish]] writer and dramatist. Over 90 volumes of short stories, novels, essays, poems and plays appeared in his lifetime,<ref name="Biblio">Lanham, Maryland, USA, 1993: Rowman & Littlefield; Joshi, S.T. and Schweitzer, Darrell; Lor7d Dunsany: A Comprehensive Bibliography (Studies in Supernatural Literature series).</ref>{{rp|29 (I.A.92)}} and material continues to appear since. Early work gave him a name in the 1910s as a great writer of the English-speaking world. Best known today are the 1924 fantasy novel, ''[[The King of Elfland's Daughter]]'', and his first book, ''[[The Gods of Pegāna]]'', which brings tales about a fictional pantheon. Many critics feel his early work in particular laid important grounds for the fantasy genre. 

Born in London as heir to one of the oldest Irish peerages, and raised there and in Kent, he later lived mainly at Ireland's possibly longest inhabited home, [[Dunsany Castle]] near [[Tara, Ireland|Tara]]. He worked with [[W. B. Yeats]] and [[Lady Gregory]], and supported the Abbey Theatre and a number of fellow writers.  He was a chess and pistol champion of Ireland, and travelled and [[fox hunting|hunted]]. He devised an asymmetrical version called [[Dunsany's chess]]. In later life he was awarded an honorary doctorate from [[Trinity College, Dublin]].  He retired to Shoreham, Kent in 1947.  In 1957 he took ill when visiting Ireland and died in Dublin of [[appendicitis]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Edward Plunkett (''Dunsany''), known to his family as "Eddie," was the first son of [[John William Plunkett, 17th Baron of Dunsany]] (1853–1899), and his wife, Ernle Elizabeth Louisa Maria Grosvenor [[Ernle]]-Erle-Drax, née Ernle Elizabeth Louisa Maria Grosvenor Burton (1855–1916).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.geni.com/people/Edward-Plunkett-18th-Baron-of-Dunsany/6000000000629554702 |title=Edward John Moreton Drax Plunkett, 18th Baron of Dunsany |website=geni_family_tree |access-date=12 July 2017}}</ref>

From a historically wealthy and famous family, Lord Dunsany was related to many well-known Irish figures. He was a kinsman of the [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] Saint [[Oliver Plunkett]], the martyred [[Archbishop of Armagh (Roman Catholic)|Archbishop of Armagh]] whose ring and [[crosier|crozier]] head are still held by the Dunsany family. He was also related to the prominent Anglo-Irish unionist and later nationalist / [[Irish Home Rule|Home Rule]] politician [[Sir Horace Plunkett]] and [[George Noble Plunkett|George Count Plunkett]], [[Papal Count]] and Republican politician, father of [[Joseph Plunkett]], executed for his part in the 1916 Rising.

His mother was a cousin of [[Sir Richard Burton]], and he inherited from her considerable height, being 6'4". The Countess of Fingall, wife of Dunsany's cousin, the [[Earl of Fingall]], wrote a best-selling account of the life of the aristocracy in Ireland in the late 19th century and early 20th century called ''Seventy Years Young''.

Plunkett's only grown sibling, a younger brother, from whom he was estranged from about 1916, for reasons not fully clear but connected to his mother's will, was the noted British naval officer [[Reginald Drax|Sir Reginald Drax]]. Another younger brother died in infancy.

Edward Plunkett grew up at the family properties, notably Dunstall Priory in [[Shoreham, Kent|Shoreham]], Kent, and [[Dunsany Castle]] in County Meath, but also family homes such as in London. His schooling was at [[Cheam School|Cheam]], [[Eton College]] and the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]], which he entered in 1896.

===Title and marriage===
The title passed to him at his father's death in 1899 at a fairly young age. The young Lord Dunsany returned to [[Dunsany Castle]] after war duty, in 1901. In that year he was also confirmed as an elector for the [[Representative Peers]] for Ireland in the [[House of Lords]].

In 1903, he met Lady Beatrice Child Villiers (1880–1970), youngest daughter of [[Victor Child Villiers, 7th Earl of Jersey|The 7th Earl of Jersey]] (head of the Jersey banking family), who was then living at [[Osterley Park]]. They married in 1904. Their one child, Randal, was born in 1906. Beatrice was supportive of Dunsany's interests and helped him by typing his manuscripts, with selecting work for his collections, including the 1954 retrospective short story collection, and overseeing his literary heritage after his death.

The Dunsanys were socially active in [[Dublin]] and London and travelled between homes in Meath, London and [[Kent]], other than during [[World War I|the First]] and [[World War II|Second world wars]] and the [[Irish War of Independence]]. Dunsany circulated with many literary figures of the time. To many of these in Ireland he was first introduced by his uncle, the co-operative pioneer [[Sir Horace Plunkett]], who also helped to manage his estate and investments for a time. He was friendly, for example, with [[George William Russell]], [[Oliver St. John Gogarty]], and for a time, [[William Butler Yeats|W. B. Yeats]]. He also socialised at times with [[George Bernard Shaw]] and [[H. G. Wells]], and was a friend of [[Rudyard Kipling]].

In 1910 Dunsany commissioned a two-storey extension to Dunsany Castle, with a billiard room, bedrooms and other facilities. The billiard room includes the crests of all the Lords Dunsany up to the 18th.

===Military experience===
[[File:Edward Plunkett Lord Dunsany.jpg|thumb|upright|Dunsany as Captain, [[Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers]], in the First World War]]
Dunsany served as a second lieutenant in the [[Coldstream Guards]] in the [[Second Boer War]]. Volunteering in the First World War and appointed Captain in the [[Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers]], he was stationed for a time at [[Ebrington Barracks]] in Derry. Hearing while on leave of disturbances in Dublin during the [[Easter Rising]] of 1916, he drove in to offer help and was wounded by a bullet lodged in his skull.<ref>Leonard R. N. Ashley, "Plunkett, Edward John Moreton Drax, eighteenth Baron Dunsany (1878–1957)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2006 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35547, accessed 26 November 2014]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.irelandseye.com/aarticles/history/people/writers/dunsany.shtm |title=Edward Plunkett, Lord Dunsany |website=irelandseye.com |access-date=12 July 2017}}</ref> After recovery at Jervis Street Hospital and what was then the King George V Hospital (now [[St. Bricin's Military Hospital]]), he returned to duty. His military belt was lost in the episode and later used at the burial of [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]]. Having been refused forward positioning in 1916 and listed as valuable as a trainer, he served in the later war stages in the trenches and in the final period writing propaganda material for the War Office with MI7b(1). There is a book at Dunsany Castle with wartime photographs, on which lost members of his command are marked.

During the [[Irish War of Independence]], Dunsany was charged with violating the [[Restoration of Order in Ireland Act 1920|Restoration of Order in Ireland Regulations]], tried by court-martial on 4 February 1921, convicted, and sentenced to pay a fine of 25 pounds or serve three months in prison without labour. The Crown Forces had searched [[Dunsany Castle and Demesne|Dunsany Castle]] and had found two double-barrelled shotguns, two rook rifles, four [[Flare gun|Very pistols]], an automatic pistol and a large quantity of pistol ammunition, along with shotgun and rifle ammunition.<ref>[https://search.findmypast.co.uk/record/browse?id=ire%2fwo35%2f134%2f00225 ''search.findmypast.co.uk''] (subscription needed).</ref>

During the [[Second World War]], Dunsany signed up for the [[Irish Army Reserve]] and the [[British Home Guard]], the two countries' local defence forces, and was especially active in [[Shoreham, Kent]], the English village bombed most during the [[Battle of Britain]].

===Literary life===
[[File:LordDinNY 1919 41yo B.jpg|thumb|left|Lord Dunsany, New York, 1919]]
Dunsany's fame arose chiefly from his prolific writings. He was involved in the [[Irish Literary Revival]]. Supporting the Revival, Dunsany was a major donor to the [[Abbey Theatre]] and he moved in Irish literary circles. He was well acquainted with [[W. B. Yeats]] (who rarely acted as editor but gathered and published a Dunsany selection), [[Lady Gregory]], [[Percy French]], "AE" Russell, Oliver St John Gogarty, [[Padraic Colum]] (with whom he jointly wrote a play) and others. He befriended and supported [[Francis Ledwidge]], to whom he gave the use of his library,<ref>''A Dictionary of Irish History since 1800'', D. J. Hickey & J. E. Doherty, Gill & MacMillan (1980)</ref> and [[Mary Lavin]].

Dunsany made his first literary tour to the United States in 1919 and further such visits up to the 1950s, in the early years mostly to the eastern seaboard and later, notably, to California.

Dunsany's own work and contribution to the Irish literary heritage were recognised with an honorary degree from [[Trinity College, Dublin]].{{Clear}}

===Early 1940s===
In 1940, Dunsany was appointed Byron Professor of English in [[Athens University]], Greece. Having reached Athens by a circuitous route, he was so successful that he was offered a post as Professor of English in [[Istanbul]]. However, he had to be evacuated due to the [[German invasion of Greece]] in April 1941, returning home by an even more complex route, his travels forming a basis for a long poem published in book form (''A Journey, in 5 cantos: The Battle of Britain, The Battle of Greece, The Battle of the Mediterranean, Battles Long Ago, The Battle of the Atlantic'', special edition January 1944). [[Olivia Manning]]'s character Lord Pinkrose in her [[novel sequence]] the ''[[Fortunes of War (novel series)|Fortunes of War]]'' was a mocking portrait of Dunsany in that period.<ref>{{Harvnb |Cooper |1989 |p=159}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb |Braybrooke |Braybrooke |2004 |p=110}}</ref>

===Later life===
In 1947, Dunsany transferred his Meath estate in trust to his son and heir and settled in Kent at his [[Shoreham, Kent|Shoreham]] house, Dunstall Priory, not far from the home of [[Rudyard Kipling]]. He visited Ireland only occasionally thereafter, and engaged actively in life in Shoreham and London. He also began a new series of visits to the United States, notably California, as recounted in Hazel Littlefield-Smith's biographical ''Dunsany, King of Dreams''.

===Death===
In 1957, Lord Dunsany became ill while eating with the [[Earl of Fingall|Earl]] and Countess of Fingall at Dunsany, in what proved to be an attack of [[appendicitis]], and died in hospital in Dublin at the age of 79. He had directed to be buried in the churchyard of the ancient church of St Peter and St Paul, Shoreham, Kent, in memory of shared wartimes. His funeral was attended by a wide range of family (including the Pakenhams, Jerseys and Fingals) and Shoreham figures, and representatives of his old regiment and various bodies in which he had taken an interest. A memorial service was held at [[Kilmessan]] in Meath with a reading of "[[Crossing the Bar]]", which was noted as coinciding with a passing flock of geese.

Lady Beatrice survived Lord Dunsany, living on mainly at Shoreham, overseeing his literary legacy until her death in 1970, while their son Randal succeeded him in the barony and was in turn succeeded by his grandson, the artist Edward Plunkett, to whom literary rights passed directly.

===Interests===
Aside from his literary work, Dunsany was a keen [[chess]] player, setting chess puzzles for journals such as ''[[The Times]]'' of London, playing [[José Raúl Capablanca]] to a draw in a [[simultaneous exhibition]], and inventing [[Dunsany's Chess]], an asymmetrical [[chess variant]] notable for not involving any [[fairy pieces]], unlike the many variants that require the player to learn unconventional piece movements. He was president of both the [[Irish Chess Union]] and the Kent County Chess Association for some years and of Sevenoaks Chess Club for 54 years.

Dunsany was a keen horseman and hunter, for many years hosting the hounds of a local hunt and hunting in parts of Africa. He was at one time the [[pistol]]-shooting champion of Ireland. Dunsany also campaigned for animal rights, being known especially for his opposition to the [[docking (dog)|"docking"]] of dogs' tails, and presided over the West Kent branch of the [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|RSPCA]] in his later years. He enjoyed [[cricket]], provided the local cricket ground situated near Dunsany Crossroads, and later played for and presided at Shoreham Cricket Club in Kent. He was a supporter of [[Scouting]] for many years, serving as President of the [[Sevenoaks]] district [[Boy Scouts Association]]. He also supported an amateur drama group, the Shoreham Players.

Dunsany provided support for the [[British Legion]] in both Ireland and Kent, including grounds in [[Trim, County Meath|Trim]] and poetry for the Irish branch's annual memorial service on a number of occasions.

==Writings==
Dunsany was a prolific writer of short stories, novels, plays, poetry, essays and autobiography. He published over 90 books in his lifetime, not including individual plays. Books have continued to appear, with more than 120 having issued by 2017. Dunsany's works have been published in many languages.

===Early career===
The then Edward Plunkett began his literary career in the late 1890s with published verses such as "Rhymes from a Suburb" and "The Spirit of the Bog", but he made a lasting impression in 1905. Writing as Lord Dunsany he produced the well-received collection ''[[The Gods of Pegāna]].''<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Edward-John-Moreton-Drax-Plunkett-18th-Baron-of-Dunsany |title=Edward John Moreton Drax Plunkett, 18th baron of Dunsany {{!}} Irish dramatist |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=12 July 2017}}</ref>

====Early fantasy====
Dunsany's most notable fantasy short stories appeared in collections from 1905 to 1919, before fantasy had been recognised as a distinct genre. He paid for the publication of the first collection, ''The Gods of Pegāna,'' earning a commission on sales. This he never again had to do.<ref>[[L. Sprague de Camp]], ''[[Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers]]: The Makers of Heroic Fantasy,'' p 53 {{ISBN|0-87054-076-9}}.</ref>

The stories in his first two books, and perhaps the beginning of his third, were set in an invented world, Pegāna, with its own gods, history and geography. Starting with this, Dunsany's name is linked to that of [[Sidney Sime]], his chosen artist, who illustrated much of his work, notably up to 1922.<ref>L. Sprague de Camp, ''Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers: The Makers of Heroic Fantasy,'' p. 54–55 {{ISBN|0-87054-076-9}}.</ref>

====Style====
Dunsany's style varied significantly throughout his writing career. Prominent Dunsany scholar [[S. T. Joshi]] has described these shifts as Dunsany moving on after he felt he had exhausted the potential of a style or medium. From the naïve fantasy of his earliest writings, through his early short-story work in 1904–1908, he turned to the self-conscious fantasy of ''The Book of Wonder'' in 1912, in which he almost seems to be parodying his lofty early style.

Each of his collections varies in mood; ''[[A Dreamer's Tales]]'' varies from the wistfulness of "Blagdaross" to the horrors of "Poor Old Bill" and "Where the Tides Ebb and Flow" to the social satire of "The Day of the Poll." The opening paragraph of "[[The Hoard of the Gibbelins]]" from ''[[The Book of Wonder]],'' (1912) gives a good indication of both the tone and tenor of Dunsany's style at the time:

:The Gibbelins eat, as is well known, nothing less good than man. Their evil tower is joined to Terra Cognita, to the lands we know, by a bridge. Their hoard is beyond reason; avarice has no use for it; they have a separate cellar for emeralds and a separate cellar for sapphires; they have filled a hole with gold and dig it up when they need it. And the only use that is known for their ridiculous wealth is to attract to their larder a continual supply of food. In times of famine they have even been known to scatter rubies abroad, a little trail of them to some city of Man, and sure enough their larders would soon be full again.

===Drama===
After ''[[The Book of Wonder]],'' Dunsany began to write plays – many of which were even more successful at the time than his early story collections – while continuing to write short stories. He carried on writing plays for the theatre into the 1930s, including the famous ''If'', and also some radio productions.<ref>[[Martin Gardner]], "Lord Dunsany" in ''Supernatural Fiction Writers: Fantasy and Horror'' (1985) edited by [[E. F. Bleiler]].Scribner's, New York, pp. 471–478. {{ISBN|0-684-17808-7}}</ref>

Although many of Dunsany's plays were successfully staged in his lifetime, he also wrote "chamber plays" or [[closet dramas]], intended only to be read privately (as if they were stories) or performed on the radio.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Some of these chamber or radio plays involve supernatural events – a character appearing out of thin air or vanishing in full view of the audience, without an explanation of how the effect is to be staged, a matter of no importance, as Dunsany did not intend them to be performed live and visibly.

===Middle period===
After a successful US lecture tour in 1919–1920, his reputation now related principally to his plays. He temporarily reduced his output of short stories, concentrating on plays, novels and poetry for a time. His poetry, now little seen, was for a time so popular that it is recited by the lead character of [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]'s ''[[This Side of Paradise]]''. His sonnet ''A Dirge of Victory'' was the only poem included in the Armistice Day edition of the [[Times of London]].

Launching another phase of his work, Dunsany's first novel, ''[[Don Rodriguez: Chronicles of Shadow Valley]]'' appeared in 1922. It is set in "a Romantic Spain that never was" and follows the adventures of a young nobleman, Don Rodriguez, and his servant in their search for a castle for Rodriguez. It has been argued that Dunsany's inexperience with the novel form shows in the episodic nature of ''Don Rodriguez.'' In 1924, Dunsany published his second novel, ''[[The King of Elfland's Daughter]],'' a return to his early style of writing. This is seen by many to be Dunsany's finest novel and a classic of fantasy writing. In his next novel, ''[[The Charwoman's Shadow]],'' Dunsany returned to the Spanish milieu and the light style of ''Don Rodriguez,'' to which it is related.

Despite his frequent shifts of style and medium, Dunsany's thematic concerns remained essentially the same. Many of his later novels had an explicitly Irish theme, from the semi-autobiographical ''[[The Curse of the Wise Woman]]'' to ''His Fellow Men.''

Among his best-known characters was [[Joseph Jorkens]], an obese middle-aged raconteur who frequented the fictional Billiards Club in London and would tell fantastic stories if anyone bought him a large whiskey and soda. From his tales it was clear that Jorkens had travelled to all seven continents, was extremely resourceful and well-versed in world cultures, but always came up short on becoming rich and famous. The ''Jorkens'' books, which sold well, were among the first of a type that would become popular in fantasy and science fiction writing: highly improbable "club tales" told at a gentleman's club or bar.

Some saw Dunsany's writing habits as peculiar. Lady Beatrice said, "He always sat on a crumpled old hat while composing his tales." (The hat was eventually stolen by a visitor to Dunsany Castle.) Dunsany almost never rewrote anything; everything he published was a first draft.<ref>[[Darrell Schweitzer]],''Pathways to Elfland: The Writings of Lord Dunsany'' (1989) Owlswick Press, {{ISBN|0-913896-16-0}}.</ref> Much of his work was written with a quill pen he made himself; Lady Beatrice was usually the first to see the writings and would help to type them. It has been said that Lord Dunsany sometimes conceived stories while hunting and would return to the Castle and draw in his family and servants to re-enact his visions before he set them on paper.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

===Translations===
Dunsany's work was translated from early on into languages that include Spanish, French, Japanese, German, Italian, Dutch, Russian, Czech and Turkish – his uncle, Horace Plunkett, suggested 14 languages by the 1920s.<ref>Horace Curzon Plunkett's Diaries, transcribed by Kate Targett (Reading Room, National Library of Ireland.</ref>

Everyone is talking about Dunsany now."

==Memberships, awards and honours==
Lord Dunsany was a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Literature]], a member and at one point President of the Authors' Society, and likewise President of the Shakespeare Reading Society from 1938 until his death in 1957, when he was succeeded by [[John Gielgud|Sir John Gielgud]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.shakespearereadingsociety.co.uk/history/ |title=The Shakespeare Reading Society – History |last=shakespeare |website=shakespearereadingsociety.co.uk |access-date=25 January 2019}}</ref>

Dunsany was also a Fellow of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] and an honorary member of the Institut Historique et Heraldique de France. He was initially an Associate Member of the Irish Academy of Letters, founded by Yeats and others, and later a full member. At one of their meetings, after 1922, he asked Seán Ó Faoláin, who was presiding, "Do we not toast the King?" Ó Faoláin replied that there was only one toast: to the Nation; but after it was given and O'Faolain had called for coffee, he saw Dunsany, standing quietly among the bustle, raise his glass discreetly, and whisper "God bless him."<ref>O'Faolain, ''Vive Moi!'', pp. 350 ''n'', 353</ref>

''The Curse of the Wise Woman'' received the Harmsworth Literary Award in Ireland.

Dunsany received an honorary doctorate, D.Litt., from [[Trinity College, Dublin]], in 1940. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize by Irish PEN, but lost to [[Bertrand Russell]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/literature/nomination.php?action=show&showid=1127 |title=Nomination Database – Literature |website=www.nobelprize.org}}</ref>

==Bibliography==
{{Main|List of works by Lord Dunsany}}

==Influences==
*Dunsany studied Greek and Latin, particularly [[Greek drama]] and [[Herodotus]], the "Father of History". Dunsany wrote in a letter: "When I learned Greek at Cheam and heard of other gods a great pity came on me for those beautiful marble people that had become forsaken and this mood has never quite left me."[http://www.yankeeclassic.com/miskatonic/dliterature/authors/dunsany/bio/dunsany.htm 1]
*The [[King James Version of the Bible|King James Bible]]: In a letter to [[Frank Harris]], Dunsany wrote: "When I went to Cheam School I was given a lot of the Bible to read. This turned my thoughts eastward. For years no style seemed to me natural but that of the Bible and I feared that I never would become a writer when I saw that other people did not use it."
*The Library of Dunsany Castle had a wide-ranging collection dating back centuries and comprising many classic works, from early encyclopaedias through parliamentary records, Greek and Latin works to Victorian illustrated books.
*He was affected by the [[fairy tales]] of the [[Brothers Grimm]] and [[Hans Christian Andersen]], and by the work of [[Edgar Allan Poe]].<ref>[[S.T. Joshi]], ''Lord Dunsany: Master of the Anglo-Irish imagination'' Greenwood Publishing Group, 1995, p. 2.</ref>
*[[Hiberno-English|Irish]] speech patterns were an influence.
*''The Darling of the Gods'', a stage play written by [[David Belasco]] and [[John Luther Long]], was first performed 1902–1903. It presents a fantastical, imaginary version of Japan that powerfully affected Dunsany and may be a template for his own imaginary kingdoms.
*[[Algernon Charles Swinburne]], who wrote the line "Time and the Gods are at strife" in his 1866 poem "[[Hymn to Proserpine]]": Dunsany later realised this was his unconscious influence for the title ''Time and the Gods''.
*The heroic romances of [[William Morris]], set in imaginary lands of the author's creation affected him, such as ''[[The Well at the World's End]]''.<ref>[[David Pringle]], ''The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', London, Carlton, 1998, p. 36.</ref>
*Dunsany's 1922 novel ''Don Rodriguez: Chronicles of Shadow Valley'' seems to draw openly on [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]]' ''[[Don Quixote]] de la Mancha'' (1605 and 1615).
*Dunsany named his play ''The Seventh Symphony'', collected in ''Plays for Earth and Air'' [1937], after [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's 7th Symphony]], which was one of Dunsany's favourite works of music.<ref>''Lord Dunsany: Master of the Anglo-Irish Imagination, p. 152.</ref> One of the last ''Jorkens'' stories returns to this theme, referring to [[Symphony No. 10 (Beethoven/Cooper)|Beethoven's ''Tenth Symphony'']].

==Writers associated with Dunsany==
*[[Francis Ledwidge]] wrote to Dunsany in 1912 asking for help in getting his poetry published. After a delay due to a hunting trip in Africa, Dunsany invited him to his home and they met and corresponded regularly thereafter. Dunsany was so impressed that he helped with publication and with introductions to literary society. Dunsany, trying to discourage Ledwidge from joining the army when the First World War broke out, offered him financial support. Ledwidge, however, joined up and found himself for a time in the same unit as Dunsany, who helped with publication of his first collection, ''Songs of the Fields'' – a critical success on its release in 1915. Ledwidge kept in contact with Dunsany through the war, sending him poems. He was killed at the [[Battle of Passchendaele]] in 1917, even as his second collection of poetry, also selected by Dunsany, circulated. Dunsany later arranged for a third collection to appear, and later still a first ''Collected Edition''. Some unpublished Ledwidge poetry and drama, given or sent to Dunsany, is still held at the Castle.
*[[Mary Lavin]] who received support and encouragement from Dunsany over many years.
*[[William Butler Yeats]], although he rarely acted as such, selected and edited a collection of Dunsany's work in 1912.
*[[Judith Blunt-Lytton, 16th Baroness Wentworth|Lady Wentworth]], a poet writing in a classical style, received support from Dunsany.

==Writers influenced by Dunsany==
*[[H. P. Lovecraft]] was much impressed by Dunsany after seeing him on a speaking tour of the United States. His "[[Dream Cycle]]" stories, his dark pseudo-history of how the universe came to be, and his god [[Azathoth]] all clearly show Dunsany's influence. He once wrote: "There are my '[[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]]' pieces and my 'Dunsany' pieces – but alas – where are my Lovecraft pieces?"<ref>Letter to Elizabeth Toldridge, 8 March 1929, quoted in ''Lovecraft: A Look Behind the Cthulhu Mythos''.</ref>
*[[Robert E. Howard]] placed Dunsany in a list of his favourite poets in a 1932 letter to Lovecraft.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rehupa.com/bookshelf_d.htm |title=REH Bookshelf - D |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512152338/http://www.rehupa.com/bookshelf_d.htm |archive-date=12 May 2011 |access-date=14 May 2010}} REH Bookshelf Website.</ref> Lovecraft also wrote a poem about Dunsany.
*[[Clark Ashton Smith]] was familiar with Dunsany's work, which had some influence on his fantasy stories.<ref>L. Sprague de Camp, ''Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers: The Makers of Heroic Fantasy'', p 212 {{ISBN|0-87054-076-9}}.</ref>
*[[J. R. R. Tolkien]], according to [[John D. Rateliff]]'s report,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=books%2Fmain%2Fclassicsdunsany%2F |title=classicsdunsany Internet Archive Wayback Machine |website=www.wizards.com |date=2 January 2005}}</ref> presented [[Clyde S. Kilby]] with a copy of ''[[The Book of Wonder]]'' as a preparation for his auxiliary role in compiling and developing ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' in the 1960's.<ref>"When American Clyde Kilby arrived in Oxford in the summer of 1966 to offer Tolkien "editorial assistance" in finishing The Silmarillion, one of the first things Tolkien did was hand him a copy of Dunsany's The Book of Wonder and tell him to read it before starting work on Tolkien's own story."</ref> Tolkien's letters and divulged notes made allusions to two stories found in the volume, "[[Chu-Bu and Sheemish]]" and "The Distressing Tale of Thangobrind the Jeweller."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.conan.com/invboard/index.php?s=22017f3d5eb8ff9a904f5f53d49c1b36&showtopic=1201&st=60&p=66377&#entry66377C |title=Archived copy |access-date=13 January 2011 |archive-date=18 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718135454/http://www.conan.com/invboard/index.php?s=22017f3d5eb8ff9a904f5f53d49c1b36&showtopic=1201&st=60&p=66377&#entry66377C |url-status=dead}}</ref> Dale J. Nelson has argued in ''[[Tolkien Studies]] 01'' that Tolkien may have been inspired by another of ''The Book of Wonder'' tales, "[[The Hoard of the Gibbelins]]," while writing a poem, "[[The Mewlips]]", included in ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Nelson |first=Dale |date=21 December 2004 |title=Possible Echoes of Blackwood and Dunsany in Tolkien's Fantasy |journal=Tolkien Studies |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/176072 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=177–181 |doi=10.1353/tks.2004.0013 |via=Project MUSE|doi-access=free}}</ref>
*[[Guillermo del Toro]], Mexican film-maker, cited Dunsany as an influence;{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} He dedicated his book ''The Hollow Ones'' to him among other "old-school horror/fantasy writers".<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Romney |first1=Jonathan |title=Guillermo del Toro: 'I could tweet 20 times a day – I'm very careful not to' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/13/guillermo-del-toro-i-could-tweet-20-times-a-day-hollow-ones-nightmare-alley |website=The Observer |date=13 September 2020}}</ref>
*[[Neil Gaiman]] expressed admiration for Dunsany and wrote an introduction to a collection of his stories. Some commentators have seen links between ''[[The King of Elfland's Daughter]]'' and Gaiman's ''Stardust'' ([[Stardust (Gaiman novel)|book]] and [[Stardust (2007 film)|film]]). This is seemingly supported by a comment of Gaiman's quoted in ''[[The Neil Gaiman Reader]]''.
*[[Jorge Luis Borges]] included Dunsany's short story "The Idle City" in ''[[The Book of Fantasy|Antología de la Literatura Fantástica]]'' (1940, revised 1976), a collection Borges selected and provided forewords to. He also, in his essay "Kafka and His Precursors," included Dunsany's story "Carcassonne" as one text that presaged or paralleled Kafka's themes.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://cafeirreal.alicewhittenburg.com/fborges.htm |title=Cafe Irreal: Fiction: Borges |website=cafeirreal.alicewhittenburg.com}}</ref>
*[[Donald Wandrei]], in a 7 February 1927 letter to [[H. P. Lovecraft]], listed Dunsany's ''The King of Elfland's Daughter'' among his collection of "weird books" that Wandrei had read.<ref>S.T. Joshi and David E. Schultz, ''Mysteries of Time and Spirit: The Letters of H. P. Lovecraft and Donald Wandrei''. Night Shade Books, San Francisco, {{ISBN|1892389495}} (p.26).</ref>
*[[Talbot Mundy]] much admired Dunsany's "plays and fantasy", according to his biographer, Brian Taves.<ref>''Talbot Mundy, Philosopher of Adventure'' by Brian Taves, McFarland, 2006, p. 253.</ref>
*[[Cyril M. Kornbluth]], an avid Dunsany reader as a young man, mentions him in a short fantasy story, "Mr. Packer Goes to Hell" (1941).<ref>Mark Rich, ''C. M. Kornbluth: The Life and Works of a Science Fiction Visionary'', Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2010, pp. 98 and 189. {{ISBN|978-0-7864-4393-2}}</ref>
*[[Arthur C. Clarke]] enjoyed Dunsany's work and corresponded with him between 1944 and 1956. The letters are collected in ''Arthur C. Clarke & Lord Dunsany: A Correspondence''. Clarke also edited and allowed the use of an early essay as an introduction to a volume of ''The Collected Jorkens''. The essay acknowledges the link between [[Jorkens]] and ''[[Tales from the White Hart]]''. Clarke states that any reader who sees a link between the two works will *not* be hearing from his solicitors.
*[[Manly Wade Wellman]] esteemed Dunsany's fiction.<ref>"I admire and constantly reread [[M. R. James]], Dunsany and [[Lafcadio Hearn|Hearn]]....": Wellman interviewed in [[Jeffrey M. Elliot]], ''Fantasy Voices: Interviews with American Fantasy Writers''. Borgo Press, San Bernardino. 1982, p. 10. {{ISBN|0-89370-146-7}}</ref>
*[[Margaret St. Clair]] was an admirer of Dunsany's work. Her story "The Man Who Sold Rope to the Gnoles" (1951) is a sequel to Dunsany's "How Nuth Would Have Practised His Art Upon the Gnoles".<ref>[[Darrell Schweitzer]], ''Pathways to Elfland'', Owlswick Press, 1989, p. 19.</ref>
*[[Evangeline Walton]] stated in an interview that Dunsany inspired her to write fantasy.<ref>Kenneth J. Zahorski and Robert H. Boyer, ''Lloyd Alexander, Evangeline Walton Ensley, Kenneth Morris: A Primary and Secondary Bibliography'', G. K. Hall, 1981, p. 116.</ref>

*[[Ursula K. Le Guin]], in an essay on style in fantasy, "From Elfland to Poughkeepsie", wrily called Dunsany the "First Terrible Fate that Awaiteth Unwary Beginners in Fantasy", alluding to a common practice among young writers at the time to attempt to write in Lord Dunsany's style.<ref>Ursula K. Le Guin, "From Elfland to Poughkeepsie", pp. 78–79 ''The Language of the Night'' {{ISBN|0-425-05205-2}}</ref>

==Curator and studies==
In the late 1990s, a curator, J. W. (Joe) Doyle, was appointed by the estate to work at Dunsany Castle, in part to locate and organise the author's manuscripts, typescripts and other materials. Doyle found several works known to exist but thought to be "lost": the plays "[[The Ginger Cat and Other Lost Plays|The Ginger Cat]]" and "The Murderers," some [[Jorkens]] stories, and the novel ''[[The Pleasures of a Futuroscope]]'' (later published by [[Hippocampus Press]]). He also found hitherto unknown works, including ''[[The Last Book of Jorkens]]'', to whose first edition he wrote an introduction, and an unnamed 1956 short story collection, published as part of ''The Ghost in the Corner and other stories'' in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dunsany.net/18th_Works.htm |title=Lord Dunsany – works |website=Dunsany family official site |access-date=20 February 2018 |archive-date=30 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181130122149/http://www.dunsany.net/18th_Works.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref> Doyle was still working as curator in 2020. Some uncollected works, previously published in magazines, and some unpublished works have been selected in consultation with them and published in chapbooks by a US press.<ref name="Pegana_Press">{{Cite web |title=Lord Dunsany (limited edition works) |url=https://peganapress.com/lord-dunsany |website=Pegana Press |access-date=12 July 2020}}</ref>

Fans and scholars [[S. T. Joshi]] and [[Darrell Schweitzer]] worked on the Dunsany œuvre for over twenty years, gathering stories, essays and reference material, for a joint initial bibliography and separate scholarly studies of Dunsany's work. Their updated bibliography appeared in 2013.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}} Joshi edited ''The Collected Jorkens'' and ''The Ginger Cat and other lost plays'' and co-edited ''The Ghost in the Corner and other stories''<ref name=Ghost_coll/> using materials unearthed by the Dunsany curator.

In the late 2000s a PhD researcher, Tania Scott from the [[University of Glasgow]], worked on Dunsany for some time and spoke at literary and other conventions; her thesis was published in 2011, entitled ''Locating Ireland in the fantastic fiction of Lord Dunsany''.<ref name="Scott_thesis_2011">{{Cite book |last1=Scott |first1=Tania |title=Locating Ireland in the fantastic fiction of Lord Dunsany |date=2011 |publisher=Glasgow University |location=Glasgow, Scotland |url=http://theses.gla.ac.uk/2630/ |access-date=30 June 2021}}</ref> A Swedish fan, Martin Andersson, was also active in research and publication in the mid-2010s.<ref name=Ghost_coll>{{Cite web |url=https://www.hippocampuspress.com/mythos-and-other-authors/fiction/the-ghost-in-the-corner-and-other-stories-by-lord-dunsany |title=The Ghost in the Corner and Other Stories by Lord Dunsany |date=25 February 2017 |publisher=Hippocampus Press |access-date=12 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.contemporaryrhyme.com/3_1_contributors.html |title=Vol. 3 No. 1 Winter 2006 – Contributors |year=2006 |publisher=contemporaryrhyme.com |access-date=12 April 2018}}</ref>

===Documentary===
An hour-long documentary, ''Shooting for the Butler'', was released by Auteur TV and Justified Films in 2014, directed by Digby Rumsey. With footage from Dunsany and Shoreham, it included interviews with the author's great-grandson, the estate's curator, author [[Liz Williams]], scholar S. T. Joshi, a local who knew the writer personally, and the head of the Irish Chess Union, among others.<ref name="Docu_rvw_2014">{{Cite journal |last1=Andersson |first1=Martin |editor1-last=Showers |editor1-first=Brian |title=Review: Shooting for the Butler |journal=The Green Book: Writings on Irish Gothic, Supernatural and Fantastic Literature |date=1 May 2015 |volume=5 |pages=70–73 |publisher=Swan River Press |location=Dublin, Ireland}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Dunsany's literary rights passed to a will trust first managed by Beatrice, Lady Dunsany, and are currently handled by Curtis Brown of London and partner firms worldwide. (Some past US deals, for example, have been listed by Locus Magazine as by SCG.){{citation needed|date=July 2020}} A few Dunsany works are protected for longer than normal copyright periods in some territories, notably most of the contents of the ''Last Book of Jorkens'',<ref name="LstBkCpyrtPg">{{Cite book |last1=Dunsany |first1=Lord |title=The Last Book of Jorkens |date=2002 |publisher=Night Shade Books |location=San Francisco, CA and Portland, OR |page=Copyright |edition=1st}}</ref> and some short stories published on the Dunsany website or elsewhere by the family in the early 2000s.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

Dunsany's primary home, over 820 years old, can be visited at certain times. Tours usually include the Library, but not the tower room where he often liked to work. His other home, Dunstall Priory, was sold to an admirer, [[Grey Ruthven, 2nd Earl of Gowrie|Grey Gowrie]], later head of the Arts Council of the UK, and then passed to other owners. The family still owns farm and downland in the area and a Tudor cottage in Shoreham village.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Anglo-Irish lords of the manor cling on to their big estates |url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/anglo-irish-lords-of-the-manor-cling-on-to-their-big-estates-35074914.html|access-date=2021-10-23 |website=independent |language=en}}</ref> The grave of Dunsany and his wife can be seen in the church graveyard there. (Most previous barons are buried in the grounds of Dunsany Castle.){{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

Dunsany's manuscripts are collected in the family archive, including some specially bound volumes of some of his works. Scholarly access is possible through the curator.
