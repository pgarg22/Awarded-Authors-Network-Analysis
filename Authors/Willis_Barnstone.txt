== Family ==
Barnstone details autobiographical memories in his memoirs and poetry. As a child, Willis and his family lived on Riverside Drive in [[New York City]]. He went to the [[World Series]] with his father to see [[Lou Gehrig]] and [[Babe Ruth]] play. In spring 1939, Joe (an [[elevator operator]] in his apartment building) took him upstairs to Ruth's apartment on the 18th floor. He was in his Boy Scout uniform. A newspaperman handed him a pile of baseball diplomas which the Babe would give out the next day at the [[1939 World's Fair]] to raise money for poor school kids. The picture appeared on the front page of the Sunday edition of the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]''.]

Barnstone's daughter and son are also poets, translators, and scholars [[Aliki Barnstone]] and [[Tony Barnstone.]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=Willis Barnstone|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/willis-barnstone|last=Foundation|first=Poetry|date=2020-04-30|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en|access-date=2020-04-30}}</ref>

==Career==

=== Teaching Positions ===
Willis Barnstone's first teaching position was instructor in English and French at the [[Anavryta Classical Lyceum]] in Greece, 1949–50, a private school in the forest of Anavryta north of Athens, attended by prince Constantine, the later ill-fated king of Greece, who was then nine years old. In 1951 he worked as a translator of French art texts for Les Éditions Skira in Geneva, Switzerland. He taught at [[Wesleyan University]], was O'Connor Professor of Greek at [[Colgate University]], and is Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Comparative Literature and Spanish at [[Indiana University]] where he has been a member of East Asian Languages & Culture, and the Institute for Biblical and Literary Studies. He started Film Studies and courses in International Popular Songs and Lyrics and Asian and Western Poetry at Indiana.

=== Anthologies of Women's Literature and World Literature From Antiquity to Now ===
Barnstone co-edited sweeping literary anthologies from antiquity to modern day, with his children Aliki Barnstone and Tony Barnstone. The 1980 anthology ''A Book of Women Poets from Antiquity to Now'' opens with the [[Sumerian language]] poet [[Enheduanna]] (2300b) and features women poets from each continent and literary epoch until 1980; later editions of the anthology end with a section on contemporary American poets, including [[Audre Lorde|Audrey Lorde]], [[Lucille Clifton]], [[Joy Harjo]], [[June Jordan]], [[Brenda Hillman|Brenda HIllman]], and [[Leslie Scalapino]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Barnstone|first=Willis|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:ypXojo0SbEAJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=a+book+of+women+poets+from+antiquity+&hl=en&as_sdt=0,33|title=A Book of Women Poets from Antiquity to Now: Selections from the World Over|last2=Barnstone|first2=Aliki|publisher=Schocken|year=1992}}</ref>

The 2003 anthology ''[[Literatures of Latin America (anthology)|Literatures of Latin America]]''<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|last=Barnstone|first=Willis|title=Literatures of Latin America|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2003|isbn=9780130613608|location=Princeton}}</ref> traces the history and evolution of literature in Latin America and the Caribbean.

Barnstone also edited ''[[Artes Hispánicas/Hispanic Arts]]'', a bilingual journal he founded on Spanish and Portuguese art, literature, and music (published biannually by Macmillan Books and Indiana University). Two of its issues were published simultaneously as books: ''The Selected Poems of [[Jorge Luis Borges]]'', guest editor [[Norman Thomas di Giovanni]], and ''Concrete Poetry: A World View'', guest editor [[Mary Ellen Solt]]. In 1959 he was commissioned by [[Eric Bentley]] for the ''Tulane Drama Review'' to do a verse translation of ''La fianza satisfecha'', an obscure, powerful play by the [[Golden Age]] Spanish playwright [[Lope de Vega]]; his translation, ''The Outrageous Saint'', was later adapted by [[John Osborne]] for his ''[[A Bond Honoured]]'' (1966). In 1964 the [[BBC Third Programme]] Radio commissioned him to translate for broadcast [[Pablo Neruda]]'s only play, the surreal verse drama ''Fulgor y muerte de [[Joaquin Murieta]]'' (''Radiance and Death of Joaquin Murieta''), which was also published in [[Modern International Drama]], 1976.

=== Translations of The Restored New Testament ===
Barnstone's biblical work is ''[[The Restored New Testament]], Including The Gnostic Gospels of Thomas, Mary, and Judas''. In this annotated translation and commentary, he restores the Latin, Greek, Aramaic, and Hebrew names to their original form. For Pilate, Andrew, Jesus and James, one reads Pilatus, Andreas, Yeshua, and Yaakov.  To reveal the poetry of the [[New Testament]], in the [[gospels]] he lineates Jesus's words as verse and renders [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] and the [[Letter (message)|Letters]] of [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] into blank verse. In his introduction he calls [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] ([[Apocalypse]]) the great epic poem of the [[New Testament]]. The ''[[Library Journal]]'' in its 7/15/09 issue wrote, "In an achievement remarkable by almost any standard, and surely one of the events of the year in publishing, renowned poet and scholar Barnstone has created a new and lavish translation—almost transformation—of the canonical and noncanonical books associated with the New Testament. In part a continuation of his work in ''The New Covenant, Commonly Called the New Testament'' (2002) and ''The Other Bible'' (2005), and in many ways the completion of the pioneering efforts of other modern translators like [[Robert Alter]], [[Reynolds Price]], and [[Richmond Lattimore]],... The high bar Barnstone has set for himself is the creation of an English-language Scripture that will move poets much as the 1611 [[King James Version]] moved [[John Milton|Milton]] and [[William Blake|Blake]]. Only time will tell if Barnstone has achieved his goal, but his work is fascinating, invigorating, and often beautiful."

==With Borges==

[[Jorge Luis Borges]] had already [[blindness|lost his sight]] in 1968 when Barnstone met him backstage at the 92nd Street Poetry Center in [[New York City|New York]] after a poetry reading he had arranged for the Argentine poet. This resulted in a long-standing literary friendship and partnership that lasted for most of their lives. In 1975–76 in [[Buenos Aires]] he collaborated with Borges on a translation of his sonnets into English. In his poem "A Blind Man", the viewpoint character (a blind Borges) looks at an infinite mirror:

<poem>
:::I do not know what face looks back at me
:::When I look at the mirrored face, nor know
:::What aged man conspires in the glow
:::Of the glass, silent and with tired fury.
:::Slow in my shadow, with my hand I explore
:::My invisible features. A sparkling ray
:::Reaches me. Glimmers of your hair are gray
:::And some are even gold. I've lost no more
:::Than just the useless surfaces of things.
:::This consolation is of great import,
:::A comfort had by Milton. I resort
:::To letters and the rose––my wonderings.
:::I think if I could see my face I'd soon
:::Know who I am on this fare afternoon.
</poem>

After returning to the United States, they went together to the universities of Indiana, Harvard, Columbia, and Chicago to give talks (charlas) that appear in ''Borges at Eighty: Conversations'' (1982). In his memoir biography of Borges, Barnstone describes the genesis of a short story that would appear posthumously. One morning at dawn he went to poet's apartment. From there to the airport to fly to the Andean city of Córdoba:

<blockquote>"These were days of the Dirty War with bombs exploding off all over the city. When I arrived, Borges was wide awake, tremendously excited. He told me his dream.  'I wasn't wakened by my usual nightmare, but by a bomb, a few buildings away. So I remembered the dream and knew it would be a story. I was tramping through downtown London, looking for a bed-and-breakfast place. Above a chemist's shop I found a shabbily respectable place and took a room.  <br />The owner, a tall, ugly, intense man had me alone and said, "I have been looking for you." <br /> His glare paralyzed me but in the hour of my dream I could see him perfectly well. 
<br /> You can't get what I don't have," I said defiantly.
<br /> "I'm not here to steal. I'm here to make you the happiest man in the world. I have just acquired Shakespeare's memory."
<br /> I took his bundle of papers, read one gloriously lucent page clearly from an unknown play, picked up the phone and wired Buenos Aires for my savings, cleaning out my miserly lifetime account. I heard the bomb and woke. By then I could not remember a word of the burning text of Shakespeare's memory. The words in gold on velum were there, in beautiful script but intelligible. I came out of my Shakespeare business quick, clean, and empty handed. Except for the story."
<br />''With Borges on an Ordinary Evening in Buenos Aires'' (Bloomington/London: Indiana University Press,1993), 70. </blockquote>

<br />In 1996 Barnstone published a sequence of 501 sonnets, including this poem on Adam and Eve who live the first morning of the globe:

<blockquote>:::THE GOOD BEASTS
:::On the first morning of the moon, in land
:::under the birds of Ur before the flood
:::dirties the memory of a couple banned
:::from apples and the fatal fire of blood,
:::Adam and Eve walk in the ghetto park,
:::circling a tree. They do not know the way
:::to make their bodies shiver I the spark
:::of fusion, cannot read or talk, and they
:::know night and noon, but not the enduring night
:::of nights that has no noon. Adam and Eve,
:::good beasts, living the morning of the globe,
:::are blind, like us, to apocalypse. They probe
:::the sun, deathray on the red tree. Its light
:::rages illiterate, until they leave.</blockquote>

Borges commented: "Four of the best things in America are Walt Whitman's ''Leaves'', Herman Melville's ''Whales'', the sonnets of Barnstone's ''The Secret Reader:  501 Sonnets'', and my daily corn flakes--that rough poetry of morning."
