==Career==
After graduation Watten returned to the San Francisco Bay area. He continued to publish ''This'' on his own and became involved in the early stages of [[language poetry]] which was developing there.<ref name="Zeller2015">{{cite web |last=Zeller |first=Corey |title=A Quick Interview with Rae Armantrout |url=https://ampersandreview.com/2015/12/a-quick-interview-with-rae-armantrout/ |publisher=The Ampersand Review |date=13 December 2015| access-date=20 December 2019}}</ref> In 1976 he and friends founded a reading series at the Grand Piano coffeehouse in San Francisco which ran through 1979.

As outlined in a report in ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', over the years Watten's behavior, allegedly short-tempered and hostile, had made many students and faculty uncomfortable. In the spring semester of 2019 several graduate students filed new complaints. Unhappy with the response, they set up a blog to collect accounts of his behavior toward students and faculty. In May the Wayne State administration hired an independent investigator.<ref name=Nguyen2019>{{cite news |last=Nguyen |first=Terry |title='I Was Sick to My Stomach': A Scholar's Bullying Reputation Goes Under the Microscope |url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/I-Was-Sick-to-My/246413 |url-access=subscription |newspaper=Chronicle of Higher Education |volume=65 |issue=34 |pages=A26–A27 |date=21 June 2019}}</ref> In November the university informed Watten that he was banned from teaching and his office would be moved to another building. Watten's faculty union, the [[American Association of University Professors]] (AAUP), filed a grievance citing lack of required due process and requesting that the restrictions be withdrawn.<ref name="Zahneis2019">{{cite news |last=Zahneis |first=Meghan |title=This Professor Was Accused of Bullying Grad Students.

==Selected publications==
Watten edited ''[[This (magazine)|This]]'', one of the central little magazines of the ''Language'' movement, and co-edited [[Poetics Journal]], one of its theoretical venues. In 1986, he returned to UC Berkeley, earning his PhD in English in 1996. His published work includes ''Bad History'' (1998) and ''Frame (1971–1990)'' which appeared in 1997. ''Frame'' brings together six previously published works of poetry from two decades: ''Opera—Works'' ; ''Decay'' ; ''1–10'' ; ''Plasma/Paralleles/"X"'' ;                                                                                                                                                                                 ''Complete Thought'' and ''Conduit'' &ndash; along with two previously uncollected texts &ndash; ''City Fields'' and ''Frame''. Two of his books &ndash; ''Progress'' (1985) and ''Under Erasure'' (1991) &ndash;  were republished with a new preface, as ''Progress'' | ''Under Erasure'' (2004).

Watten is co-author, with [[Michael Davidson (poet)|Michael Davidson]], [[Lyn Hejinian]], and [[Ron Silliman]], of ''Leningrad: American Writers in the Soviet Union'' (1991). He has published three volumes of literary and cultural criticism, ''Total Syntax'' (1985);''The Constructivist Moment: From Material Text to Cultural Poetics'' (2003);  and ''Questions of Poetics: Language Writing and Consequences'' (2016). Watten earned his [[PhD]] at the [[University of California at Berkeley]] in 1995. His dissertation was entitled: ''Horizon Shift: Progress and Negativity in American Modernism''. In 2007, Martin Richet translated into French ''Plasma / Parallèles / «X»'', a volume that joins together three long poems which originally appeared in a chapbook by Tuumba Press in 1979.<ref>[http://www.lequartanier.com/catalogue/plasma.htm Le Quartanier éditeur & revue]</ref>

Watten is also co-author, with [[Tom Mandel (poet)|Tom Mandel]], [[Lyn Hejinian]], [[Ron Silliman]], [[Kit Robinson]], [[Carla Harryman]], [[Rae Armantrout]], [[Ted Pearson]], [[Steve Benson (poet)|Steve Benson]], and [[Bob Perelman]]  of ''The Grand Piano: An Experiment in Collective Autobiography.''

The project takes its name from a coffeehouse at 1607 Haight Street, where from 1976-79 the authors curated a reading and performance series. The project began in 1998; it was constructed via online collaboration, using Web-based software and an email listserv.
