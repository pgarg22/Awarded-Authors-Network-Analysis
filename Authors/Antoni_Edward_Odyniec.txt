'''Antoni Edward Odyniec''' (25 January 1804 – 15 January 1885) was a [[Polish Romanticism|Polish Romantic]]-era poet who penned the celebrated "Song of the [[Filaret Association|Filarete]]s".

Said to be an imitator of his friend [[Adam Mickiewicz]], Odyniec made his mark as a [[translation|translator]] of works by writers, including [[Walter Scott]], [[Byron]], [[Friedrich Schiller]] and [[Pushkin]]. He was also an organizer of the literary scene and author of colourful [[memoir]]s that described the [[private sphere|private lives]] of writers, especially Mickiewicz.<ref>"Odyniec, Antoni Edward," ''[[Encyklopedia Polski]]'', pp. 456–57.</ref>

==Life==
Odyniec was born in Giejstuny, Oszmiana County, now in [[Belarus]], in 1804.

Odyniec was an alumnus of [[Wilno University]], where he was a member of the [[Filaret Association]] and a defendant, along with Mickiewicz and others, in the 1824 trial of Association members.<ref>''Encyklopedia powszechna PWN'', vol. 3, p. 349 (hereinafter "PWN").</ref>

In 1825 he published his first collection of short works and lived in Warsaw. In 1829–30 he accompanied his fellow poet and ex-''Filaret'' [[Adam Mickiewicz]] on a tour of Germany, Italy and Switzerland, recounted in somewhat embroidered ''Listy z podróży'' (Travel Letters).<ref>''Listy z podróży'' (Travel Letters), 4 vols., 1875–78. PWN.</ref>

In 1831 Odyniec settled in [[Dresden]], in [[Saxony]], where he translated works by [[Walter Scott]], [[Byron]] and [[Thomas Moore]]. He also co-edited a "Library of Polish Classics," and wrote for ''Przyjaciel Ludu'' (The Friend of the People), published in [[Leszno]].

In 1837 he returned to Wilno (Vilnius), where he edited Gluksberg's ''Encyklopedia Powszechna'' (Universal Encyclopedia) and, in 1840–63, ''Kurier Wileński'' (The Wilno Courier).

In 1866 Odyniec returned to Warsaw, where he edited ''Kurier Warszawski'' (The Warsaw Courier) and published in ''Kronika Rodzinna'' (The Family Chronicle) his ''Travel Letters'' and ''Remembrances of the Past, As Told to Deotyma''.
He died in Warsaw in 1885.

He penned ballads, songs and legends, published in ''Poezje'' (Poems, 2 vols., 1825–26); dramatic works, including ''[[Barbara Radziwiłłówna]]'' (1858); translations of works by [[Gottfried August Bürger]], [[Byron]], [[Walter Scott]] (3 vols., 1838–44); and ''Wspomnienia z przeszłości opowiadane Deotymie'' (Remembrances of the Past, As Told to Deotyma, 1884).<ref>PWN.</ref>
