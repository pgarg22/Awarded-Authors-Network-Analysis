'''Frederic William Farrar''' (Bombay, 7 August 1831 – [[Canterbury]], 22 March 1903) was a cleric of the [[Church of England]] ([[Anglican]]), schoolteacher and author. He was a pallbearer at the funeral of [[Charles Darwin]] in 1882. He was a member of the [[Cambridge Apostles]] secret society.  He was the Archdeacon of Westminster from 1883 to 1894, and Dean of Canterbury Cathedral from 1895 until his death in 1903.

==Biography==
Farrar was born in [[Bombay]], India, and educated at [[King William's College]] on the [[Isle of Man]], [[King's College London]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].<ref>{{acad|id=FRR849FW|name=Farrar, Frederic William}}</ref> At Cambridge he won the [[Chancellor's Gold Medal]] for poetry in 1852.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Complete Collection of the English Poems which Have Obtained the Chancellor's Gold Medal in the University of Cambridge|publisher=W. Metcalfe|location=Cambridge|url=https://archive.org/details/acompletecollec00cambgoog|author=University of Cambridge|format=PDF|year=1859|access-date=1 October 2008}}</ref> He was for some years a master at [[Harrow School]] and, from 1871 to 1876, the headmaster of [[Marlborough College]].

Farrar spent much of his career associated with [[Westminster Abbey]]. He was successively a [[Dean and Chapter of Westminster#List of canons|canon there]], rector of [[St Margaret's, Westminster|St Margaret's]] (the church next door), [[archdeacon]] of the Abbey. He later served as [[Dean of Canterbury]];<ref>[[Crockford's Clerical Directory]] 1898 p403: London, Horace Cox, 1898</ref> and [[In ordinary#Royal Household|chaplain in ordinary]], i.e. attached to the [[Royal Household]].<ref>[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn92070553/1901-05-02/ed-1/seq-3/ A Famous Churchman], in the ''Red River Prospector'', published 2 May 1901; retrieved 17 May 2014</ref> He was an eloquent preacher and a voluminous author, his writings including [[school story|stories of school life]], such as ''[[Eric, or, Little by Little]]'' and ''St. Winifred's'' about life in a boys' boarding school in late Victorian England, and two historical romances.

Farrar was a classics scholar and a [[comparative philology|comparative philologist]], who applied [[Charles Darwin]]'s ideas of branching descent to the relationships between languages, engaging in a protracted debate with the anti-Darwinian linguist [[Max Müller]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Alter|first=Stephen G.|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|title=Darwinism and the Linguistic Image: Language, Race, and Natural Theology in the Nineteenth Century|year=1991|place=Baltimore and London}}</ref> While Farrar was never convinced by the evidence for evolution in biology, he had no theological objections to the idea and urged that it be considered on purely scientific grounds.<ref name="Farrar 1902">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/lifefredericwil00farrgoog|last=Farrar|first=Reginald|title=The life of Frederic William Farrar, D.D., F.R.S., etc., sometime dean of Canterbury|year=1902|publisher=T.Y. Crowell|place=New York}}</ref> On Darwin's nomination, Farrar was elected to the [[Royal Society]] in 1866 for his philological work. When Darwin died in 1882, Farrar helped get the church's permission for him to be buried in Westminster Abbey and preached the sermon at his funeral.<ref name="Farrar 1902"/>

Farrar's religious writings included ''Life of Christ'' (1874), which had great popularity, and ''Life of St. Paul'' (1879). He also contributed two volumes to the commentary series [[Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges|The Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges]], on the Gospel according to St. Luke, and on the Epistle to the Hebrews. His works were translated into many languages, especially ''Life of Christ''.

Farrar believed that some could be saved after death.<ref name=":0" /><ref>''The Eternal Fate of Unbelievers, Part II'', "[http://www.angelfire.com/ca4/cor/hell2.htm The Witness of Church History (2): The Modern Period]", excerpted and adapted from ''Hell on Trial: The Case for Eternal Punishment'' by Robert A. Peterson (Phillipsburg, N.J.: Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing), 1995, Extract by Garry J. Moes.</ref> He originated the term "[[abominable fancy]]" for the longstanding Christian idea that the eternal punishment of the damned would entertain the saved.<ref>The Decline of Hell: Seventeenth-Century Discussions of Eternal Torment. Walker DP. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1964</ref> Farrar published ''Eternal Hope'' in 1878 and ''Mercy and Judgment'' in 1881, both of which defend his position on hell at length.<ref name=":0">F. W. Farrar. ''[http://www.tentmaker.org/books/mercyandjudgment/mercy_and_judgment_ch1.html Mercy and Judgment]''. 1881.</ref><ref name=":1" />

Farrar was accused of [[Universal reconciliation|universalism]], but he denies this belief with great certainty. In 1877 Farrar in an introduction to five sermons he wrote, in the preface he attacks the idea that he holds to universalism. He also dismisses any accusation from those who would say otherwise. He says, "I dare not lay down any dogma of Universalism, partly because it is impossible for us to estimate the hardening effect obstinate persistence in evil, and the power of the human will to resist the love of God."<ref name=":1">"Eternal Hope" by Rev. Frederic W. Farrar,(New York:E.P. Dutton & Company, 1878), xvi and xxi.</ref>

In April 1882, he was one of ten pallbearers at the funeral of [[Charles Darwin]] in Westminster Abbey; the others were: The Duke of Devonshire, The Duke of Argyll, The Earl of Derby, Mr. J. Russell Lowell, Mr. W. Spottiswoode, Sir Joseph Hooker, Mr. A. R. Wallace, Professor Huxley, and Sir John Lubbock.<ref name="dnb"/><ref>The Funeral of Mr Darwin, ''[[The Times]]'', 27 April 1882.
