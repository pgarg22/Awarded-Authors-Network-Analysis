==Early life==
Aidoo was born on 23 March 1942 in [[Saltpond]] in the [[Central Region, Ghana|Central Region of Ghana]]. Some sources including Megan Behrent, Brown University, and Africa Who's Who have stated that she was born on 31 March 1940.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ama Ata Aidoo: BiographicalIntroduction|url=http://www.postcolonialweb.org/africa/ghana/aidoo/aidoobio.html|access-date=2019-05-09|website=www.postcolonialweb.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=UWECHUE|first=RAPH|title=Africa Who's Who|publisher=Africa Books Limited|year=1996|isbn=9780798303446|location=LONDON|pages=80–81}}</ref>

She was raised in a [[Fante people|Fante]] royal household, the daughter of Nana Yaw Fama, chief of [[Abeadzi Kyiakor]], and Maame Abasema.<ref>[https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9780203058558/chapters/10.4324/9780203058558-4 "AMA ATA AIDOO (1942-)"], ''Postcolonial African Writers'', Routledge, 1998.</ref> She grew up at a time of resurgent British neocolonialism that was taking place in her homeland. Her grandfather was murdered by neocolonialists, which brought her father's attention to the importance of educating the children and families of the village on the history and events of the era. This led him to open up the first school in their village and influenced Aidoo to attend the Wesley Girls Highschool where she first decided she wanted to be a writer.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Her Story {{!}} BBC World Service|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/arts/features/womenwriters/aidoo_life.shtml|access-date=2020-12-12|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>
