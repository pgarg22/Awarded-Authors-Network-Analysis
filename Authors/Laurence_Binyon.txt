'''Robert Laurence Binyon,''' [[Companion of Honour|CH]] (10 August 1869 – 10 March 1943) was an English poet, dramatist and art scholar. Born in [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]], England, his parents were Frederick Binyon, a clergyman, and Mary Dockray. He studied at [[St Paul's School, London]] and at [[Trinity College, Oxford]], where he won the [[Newdigate Prize]] for poetry in 1891. He worked for the [[British Museum]] from 1893 until his retirement in 1933. In 1904 he married the historian Cicely Margaret Powell, with whom he had three daughters, including the artist [[Nicolete Gray]].

Moved by the casualties of the  [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] in 1914, Binyon wrote his most famous work "[[For the Fallen]]", which is often recited at [[Remembrance Sunday]] services in the UK, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. In 1915, he volunteered as a hospital orderly in France and afterwards worked in England, helping to take care of the wounded of the [[Battle of Verdun]]. He wrote about these experiences in ''For Dauntless France''. After the war, he continued his career at the British Museum, writing numerous books on art.

He was appointed Norton Professor of Poetry at [[Harvard University]] in 1933. Between 1933 and his death in 1943, he  published his translation of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]''. His war poetry includes a poem about the London [[The Blitz|Blitz]], "The Burning of the Leaves", regarded by many as his masterpiece.

==Early life==
Laurence Binyon was born in [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]], [[Lancashire]], England. His parents were Frederick Binyon, a clergyman of the Church of England, and Mary Dockray. Mary's father, Robert Benson Dockray, was a main engineer of the [[London and Birmingham Railway]]. His forebears were Quakers.<ref name="dictionary">[http://arthistorians.info/binyonl Binyon, (Robert) Laurence]. arthistorians.info. Retrieved on 19 July 2016.</ref>

Binyon studied at [[St Paul's School, London]]. Then he read [[Classics]] (''[[Honour Moderations]]'') at [[Trinity College, Oxford]], where he won the [[Newdigate Prize]] for poetry in 1891.

Immediately after graduating in 1893, Binyon started working for the Department of Printed Books of the [[British Museum]], writing [[Exhibition catalogue|catalogues]] for the museum and art [[monographs]] for himself. In 1895 his first book, ''Dutch Etchers of the Seventeenth Century'', was published. In that same year, Binyon moved into the Museum's Department of Prints and Drawings, under [[Campbell Dodgson]].<ref name="dictionary" /> In 1909, Binyon became its Assistant Keeper, and in 1913, he was made the Keeper of the new Sub-Department of Oriental Prints and Drawings. Around then, he played a crucial role in the formation of Modernism in London by introducing young [[Imagism|Imagist poets]] such as [[Ezra Pound]], [[Richard Aldington]] and [[H.D.]] to East Asian visual art and literature.<ref>Arrowsmith, Rupert Richard. [https://books.google.com/books?id=MIBNXScRj3QC&lpg=PP1&dq=modernism%20and%20the%20museum&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Modernism and the Museum: Asian, African and Pacific Art and the London Avant Garde''].

In 1904 he married historian Cicely Margaret Powell, and the couple had three daughters. During those years, Binyon belonged to a [[social circle|circle]] of artists, as a regular patron of the [[Vienna Café]] in [[Oxford Street]]. His fellow intellectuals there were Ezra Pound, Sir [[William Rothenstein]], [[Walter Sickert]], [[Charles Ricketts]], [[Lucien Pissarro]] and [[Edmund Dulac]].<ref name="dictionary" />

Binyon's reputation before the [[First World War]] was such that on the death of the [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]] [[Alfred Austin]] in 1913, Binyon was among the names mentioned in the press as his likely successor (others named included [[Thomas Hardy]], [[John Masefield]] and [[Rudyard Kipling]], but the post went to [[Robert Bridges]]).

=="For the Fallen"==
{{wikisource|For the Fallen}}
{{main|For the Fallen}}
Moved by the opening of what was then called the Great War and the already-high number of casualties of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]], Binyon wrote his "For the Fallen" in 1914, with its "[[Ode of Remembrance]]" (the third and fourth or simply the fourth stanza of the poem). At the time, he was visiting the cliffs on the north [[Cornwall]] coast, either at [[Polzeath]] or at [[Portreath]]. (There is a plaque at each site to commemorate the event, but Binyon himself mentioned [[Polzeath]] in a 1939 interview. The confusion may be related to Porteath Farm being near Polzeath.) The piece was published by ''[[The Times]]'' in September, when public feeling was affected by the recent [[First Battle of the Marne|Battle of the Marne]].

Today Binyon's most famous poem, "For the Fallen", is often recited at British [[Remembrance Sunday]] services; is an integral part of [[Anzac Day]] services in Australia and New Zealand and of 11 November Remembrance Day services in Canada.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ode of Remembrance |publisher=Fifth Battalion The [[Royal Australian Regiment]] Official Website |url=http://5rar.asn.au/ode.htm |access-date=12 June 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313110108/http://5rar.asn.au/ode.htm  |archive-date=13 March 2007 |url-status=dead }} "Titled; For the Fallen, the ode first appeared in [[The Times]] on 21 September 1914. It has now become known in Australia as the Ode of Remembrance: the verse in bold above is read at dawn services and other ANZAC tributes."</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-24/history-of-the-anzac-day-ode-or-remembrance/7353860|title=Anzac Day: The Ode of Remembrance is taken from the Laurence Binyon poem For The Fallen|last=McLoughlin|first=Chris|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=24 April 2016|access-date=23 November 2018|archive-date=23 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181123112427/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-24/history-of-the-anzac-day-ode-or-remembrance/7353860}}</ref> The "Ode of Remembrance" has thus been claimed as a tribute to all casualties of war, regardless of nation.

:''They went with songs to the battle, they were young.''
:''Straight of limb, true of eyes, steady and aglow.''
:''They were staunch to the end against odds uncounted,''
:''They fell with their faces to the foe.''

:''They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old:''
:''Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.''<!-- "Condemn" is in fact the correct word. See the below for more. -->
:''At the going down of the sun and in the morning,''
:''We will remember them.''

:''They mingle not with their laughing comrades again;''
:''They sit no more at familiar tables of home;''
:''They have no lot in our labour of the day-time;''
:''They sleep beyond England's foam''

(This "Ode to Remembrance" comprises the central three stanzas of the seven-stanza poem "For the Fallen", being preceded, and followed, by two additional stanzas. The Ode itself, as used in remembrance services, is more usually only the central stanza of the three shown above. The full poem may be found [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Times/1914/Arts/For_the_Fallen here].)

Three of Binyon's poems, including "For the Fallen", were set by Sir [[Edward Elgar]] in his last major orchestra/choral work, ''[[The Spirit of England]]''.<ref>Stout, Janis. [https://search.proquest.com/docview/1032615 "'This Dreadful Winnowing-Fan': Rhetoric of War in Edward Elgar's ''The Spirit of England''"], ''Choral Journal'', 44.9, April 2004, pp. 9–19 {{subscription}}</ref>
 
In 1915, despite being too old to enlist in the armed forces, Binyon volunteered at a British hospital for French soldiers, [[Hôpital Temporaire d'Arc-en-Barrois]], [[Haute-Marne]], France, working briefly as a hospital orderly. He returned in the summer of 1916 and took care of soldiers taken in from the [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]] battlefield. He wrote about his experiences in ''For Dauntless France'' (1918) and his poems, "Fetching the Wounded" and "The Distant Guns", were inspired by his hospital service in [[Arc-en-Barrois]].

''Artists Rifles'', a CD audiobook published in 2004, includes a reading of "For the Fallen" by Binyon himself. The recording itself is undated and appeared on a 78 rpm disc issued in Japan. Other Great War poets heard on the CD include [[Siegfried Sassoon]], [[Edmund Blunden]], [[Robert Graves]], [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]] and [[Edgell Rickword]].<ref>[http://www.ltmrecordings.com/artistsriflesaudioCD.html Artists Rifles (1914–18)].

==Later life==
After the war, he returned to the [[British Museum]] and wrote numerous books on art, in particular on [[William Blake]], [[Persian art]], and [[Japanese art]]. His work on ancient Japanese and Chinese cultures offered strongly-contextualised examples that inspired, among others, the poets [[Ezra Pound]] and [[W. B. Yeats]]. Binyon's work on Blake and his followers kept alive the then nearly-forgotten memory of the work of [[Samuel Palmer]]. Binyon's duality of interests continued the traditional interest of British visionary [[Romanticism]] in the rich strangeness of Mediterranean and Oriental cultures.

[[File:Portrait of Laurence Binyon.jpg|thumb|220px|Laurence Binyon]]
In 1931, his two-volume ''Collected Poems'' appeared. In 1932, Binyon rose to be the Keeper of the Prints and Drawings Department, but in 1933, he retired from the British Museum.<ref name="dictionary" /> He went to live in the country at Westridge Green, near [[Streatley, Berkshire]], where his daughters also came to live during the [[Second World War]], and he continued to write poetry.

In 1933–1934, Binyon was appointed [[Charles Eliot Norton|Norton]] Professor of Poetry at [[Harvard University]]. He delivered a series of lectures on ''The Spirit of Man in Asian Art'', which were published in 1935. Binyon continued his academic work. In May 1939, he gave the prestigious [[Romanes Lecture]] in [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] on ''Art and Freedom'', and in 1940, he was appointed the [[Lord Byron|Byron]] Professor of English Literature at [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens|University of Athens]].  He worked there until he was forced to leave, narrowly escaping the [[Battle of Greece|German invasion of Greece]] in April 1941 .<ref name="dictionary" /> He was succeeded by [[Lord Dunsany]], who held the chair in 1940–1941.

Binyon had been friends with Pound since around 1909, and in the 1930s, the two became especially close; Pound affectionately called him "BinBin" and assisted Binyon with his translation of Dante. Another protégé was [[Arthur Waley]], whom Binyon employed at the British Museum.

Between 1933 and 1943, Binyon published his acclaimed translation<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1985/feb/14/shall-we-dante/|title=Shall We Dante?|last=Brandeis|first=Irma|author2=D. S. Carne-Ross |date=14 February 1985|work=[[The New York Review of Books]]|access-date=23 December 2014}}</ref> of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' in an English version of ''[[terza rima]]'', made with some editorial assistance by [[Ezra Pound]]. He dedicated twenty years to his translation and finished it shortly before his death.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ed. Milano|first=Paolo|title=The portable Dante|year=1977|publisher=Penguin|location=Harmondsworth|isbn=0-14-015032-3|pages=xxxii|edition=Rev.|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/portabledante00dant}}</ref> Its readership was dramatically increased when Paolo Milano selected it for "The Portable Dante" in Viking's Portable Library series. Binyon significantly revised his translation of all three parts for the project,<ref>{{cite book|last=Ed. Milano|first=Paolo|title=The portable Dante|year=1978|publisher=Penguin|location=Harmondsworth|isbn=0-14-015032-3|pages=xliii|edition=Rev.|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/portabledante00dant}}</ref> and the volume went through three major editions and eight printings (while other volumes in the same series went out of print) before it was replaced by the [[Mark Musa]] translation in 1981.

During the Second World War, Binyon continued to write poetry including a long poem about the [[London Blitz]], "The Burning of the Leaves", which is regarded by many as his masterpiece. In 2016, [[Paul O'Prey]] edited a new selection of his poems, ''Poems of Two Wars'', which brought together the poems written during both wars, with an introductory essay on Binyon's work that makes the case for his later poetry to be considered as his best.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Poems of Two Wars|last=Binyon|first=Laurence|publisher=Dare-Gale Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0-9933311-1-4|location=London}}</ref>

At his death, Binyon was working on a major three-part [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] trilogy, the first part of which was published after his death as ''The Madness of [[Merlin (wizard)|Merlin]]'' (1947).

He died in Dunedin Nursing Home, Bath Road, [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], on 10 March 1943, aged 73, after an operation. A funeral service was held at Trinity College Chapel, Oxford, on 13 March 1943.

There is a [[slate]] memorial in St Mary's Church, in [[Aldworth]], [[Berkshire]], where Binyon's ashes were scattered. On 11 November 1985, Binyon was among 16 Great War poets commemorated on a slate stone unveiled in [[Westminster Abbey]]'s [[Poets' Corner]].<ref>[http://net.lib.byu.edu/english/wwi/poets/poets.html Poets of the Great War]. Net.lib.byu.edu. Retrieved on 19 July 2016.</ref> The inscription on the stone quotes a fellow Great War poet, [[Wilfred Owen]]. It reads: "My subject is War, and the pity of War. The Poetry is in the pity".<ref>[http://net.lib.byu.edu/english/wwi/poets/Preface.html Preface]. ''The Poems of Wilfred Owen''. Jon Stallworthy (ed.). – Hogarth original definitive papeback ed.

==Family==
His three daughters (Helen, Margaret and [[Nicolete Gray|Nicolete]]) became artists. [[Helen Binyon]] (1904–1979) studied with [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]] and [[Eric Ravilious]], illustrating many books for the [[Oxford University Press]], and was also a marionettist. She later taught puppetry and published ''Puppetry Today'' (1966) and ''Professional Puppetry in England'' (1973). Margaret Binyon wrote children's books, which were illustrated by Helen. Nicolete, as [[Nicolete Gray]], was a distinguished [[calligraphy|calligrapher]] and art scholar.<ref>{{cite ODNB|first=John |last=Hatcher|title=Binyon, (Robert) Laurence (1869–1943)|id=31890}}</ref>
