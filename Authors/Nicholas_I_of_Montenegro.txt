'''Nikola I Petrović-Njegoš''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Никола I Петровић-Његош}}; {{OldStyleDate|7 October|1841|25 September}} – 1 March 1921) was the ruler of [[Montenegro]] from 1860 to 1918, reigning as [[Principality of Montenegro|prince]] from 1860 to 1910 and as the country's first and only [[Kingdom of Montenegro|king]] from 1910 to 1918.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Nikola was born in the village of [[Njeguši]], the home of the reigning [[House of Petrović]]. His father, [[Mirko Petrović-Njegoš]], a celebrated Montenegrin warrior, was elder brother to [[Danilo I, Prince of Montenegro|Danilo I of Montenegro]], who left no male offspring. After 1696, when the dignity of [[vladika]], or prince-bishop, became hereditary in the Petrović family, the sovereign power had descended from uncle to nephew, the vladikas belonging to the order of the black [[clergy]] (i.e., [[monastic]] clergy) who are forbidden to marry. A change was introduced by Danilo I, who declined the episcopal office, married and declared the principality hereditary in the direct male line. Mirko Petrović-Njegoš having renounced his claim to the throne, his son was nominated heir-presumptive, and the old system of succession was thus incidentally continued.

Prince Nikola, who had been trained from infancy in martial and athletic exercises, spent a portion of his early boyhood in [[Trieste]] at the household of the Kustic family, to which his aunt, the princess Darinka, wife of Danilo II, belonged. The princess was an ardent [[francophile]], and at her suggestion, the young heir-presumptive of the vladikas was sent to the [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]] in [[Paris]]. Unlike his contemporary, [[Milan I of Serbia|King Milan of Serbia]], Prince Nikola was little influenced in his tastes and habits by his Parisian education; the young highlander, whose keen patriotism, capability for leadership and poetic talents early displayed themselves, showed no inclination for the pleasures of the French capital, and eagerly looked forward to returning to his native land.

Nikola was a member of the "[[United Serbian Youth]]" (Уједињена омладина српска) during its existence (1866–1871).<ref>Matica srpska (Novi Sad, Serbia) Zbornik za istoriju, Volume 2, Odeljenje za društvene nauke, Matica srpska, 1970, p. 191: "У том смислу занимљиви су прилози: Николе Петровића, Историјско лес- то, улога и значај Уједин>ене омладине ..."</ref><ref>Jelena Danilović: Sto godina Opšteg imovinskog zakonika za Crnu Goru, Arhiv za pravne i društvene nauke, 1–2, 2006, str. 233</ref> After the organization was prohibited in the [[Principality of Serbia]] and [[Austro-Hungary]], the "[[Association for Serb Liberation and Unification]]" (Дружина за ослобођење и уједињење српско) was established by Nikola, [[Marko Miljanov|Marko Popović]], Simo Popović, [[Mašo Vrbica]], [[Vasa Pelagić]], and more, in Cetinje (1871).<ref>Миодраг Јовичић, Лексикон уставности Србије 1804–1918</ref><ref>Istorijski institut SR Crne Gore u Titogradu 1990, Istoriski zapisi, Volume 63, Istorijski institut u Titogradu, pp. 40–41</ref><ref>Мартиновић, Нико С.

Nicholas I of Montenegro was also reflected in literature. His most significant works are the Serb patriotic song "[[Onamo, 'namo!]]" (There, over there!), and the drama "Empress of the Balkan".<ref name=GC>[[Glas Crnogorca]], October 19, 1999: [[Jovan Markuš]]: [http://www.njegos.org/heritage/himne.htm Двије црногорске химне]</ref>

===Prince of Montenegro===
[[File:Nicholas I of Montenegro, 1909.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Prince Nicholas in 1909.]]
While still in Paris, Nikola succeeded his assassinated uncle Danilo I as prince (13 August 1860). At age 19, in [[Cetinje]], on 8 November 1860, he married [[Milena of Montenegro|Milena]], 13 years old, daughter of a [[Vojvoda]] named [[Petar Vukotić]] and wife Jelena Vojvodić.

In the period of peace which followed Nikola carried out a series of military, administrative and educational reforms. The country was embroiled in a series of wars with the [[Ottoman Empire]] between 1862 and 1878. In 1867 he met the emperor [[Napoleon III]] at Paris, and in 1868 he undertook a journey to Russia, where he received an affectionate welcome from the [[tsar]], [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]. He afterwards visited the courts of [[Berlin]] and [[Vienna]]. His efforts to enlist the sympathies of the Russian imperial family produced important results for Montenegro; considerable subsidies were granted by the tsar and tsaritsa for educational and other purposes, and supplies of arms and ammunition were sent to [[Cetinje]]. In 1871 Prince Dolgorukov arrived at Montenegro on a special mission from the tsar, and distributed large sums of money among the people. In 1869 Prince Nikola, whose authority was now firmly established, succeeded in preventing the impetuous highlanders from aiding the Krivosians in their revolt against the [[Austria]]n government; similarly in 1897 he checked the martial excitement caused by the outbreak of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War]].

[[File:Kralj i kraljica u krugu sire familije.jpg|thumb|right|250px|King Nicholas I with his wife, sons, daughters, grandchildren and sons- and daughters-in-law in 1910.]]
In 1876 Nikola declared war against Turkey; his military reputation was enhanced by the ensuing campaign, and still more by [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878) | that of 1877/78]], during which he captured [[Nikšić]], [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]] and [[Ulcinj]]. The war resulted in a considerable extension of the Montenegrin frontier and the acquisition of a seaboard on the [[Adriatic]]. Nikola justified the war as a revenge for the [[Battle of Kosovo]] (1389). In 1876 he sent a message to the Montenegrins in [[Herzegovina]]:
:''Under [[Murad I]] the [[Serbian Empire]] was [[Fall of the Serbian Empire|destroyed]], under [[Murad V]] it has to rise again. This is my wish and wish of all of us as well as the wish of almighty God''.

The [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878 recognised the independence of Montenegro, and in the succeeding decades Montenegro enjoyed considerable prosperity and stability.  Education, communications and the army expanded greatly (the latter with support from [[Imperial Russia]]). In 1883 Prince Nikola visited the [[sultan]], with whom he subsequently maintained the most cordial relations; in 1896 he celebrated the bicentenary of the Petrović dynasty, and in the same year he attended the coronation of [[Nicholas II]]; in May 1898 he visited [[Queen Victoria]] at [[Windsor Castle]].

}}

In 1900 Nikola took the style of ''[[Royal Highness]]''.

According to Bolati, the Montenegrin court was not grieving that much over the [[May Coup (Serbia)|murder of King Alexander Obrenović]], as they saw him as an enemy of Montenegro and obstacle to the unification of Serb Lands. "Although it wasn't said openly, it was thought that the Petrović dynasty would achieve [the unification]. All procedures of King Nikola shows that he himself believed that".<ref name="Živojinović1988">{{cite book|author=Dragoljub R. Živojinović|title=Petar I Karađorđević: U otadžbini, 1903–1914. godine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LekJAQAAIAAJ|year=1988|publisher=Beogradskĭ izdavačko-grafički zavod|page=25|isbn=9788613003243}}</ref>

[[File:Nicholas-I-of-Montenegro-1913.jpg|thumb|left|230px|King Nicholas I triumphantly enters [[Shkodra]] in April 1913, after [[Siege of Scutari (1912–1913)|the siege]].]]

He gave Montenegro its first [[constitution]] in 1905 following pressure from a population eager for more freedom. He also introduced west-European style [[press freedom]] and [[criminal law]] codes. In 1906, he introduced Montenegrin [[currency]], the [[Montenegrin perper|perper]]. On 28 August 1910, during the celebration of his jubilee, he assumed the title of [[King of Montenegro|king]], in accordance with a petition from the [[Deliberative assembly|Skupština]]. 
He was at the same time gazetted [[field-marshal]] in the [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian army]], an honor never previously conferred on any foreigner except [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|the Duke of Wellington]].  When the [[Balkan Wars]] broke out in 1912 King Nikola was one of the most enthusiastic of the allies. He wanted to drive the Ottomans completely out of Europe. He defied the [[Concert of Europe]] and captured [[Shkodër|Scutari]] despite the fact that they blockaded the whole coast of Montenegro. Again in the [[World War I|Great War]] which began in 1914 he was the first to go to Serbia's aid to repel the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] forces from the [[Balkans|Balkan Peninsula]].

In January 1916, after the defeat of Serbia, Montenegro was also [[Montenegrin Campaign (World War I)|conquered by Austria-Hungary]], and the King fled to Italy and then to France. The government transferred its operations to [[Bordeaux]]. After the end of the [[World War I|First World War]], a [[Podgorica Assembly|meeting in Podgorica]] voted to depose Nikola and annex Montenegro to Serbia.  A few months later, Serbia (including Montenegro) merged with the former South Slav territories of Austria-Hungary to form the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], which was renamed [[Yugoslavia]] in 1929. Nikola went into exile in [[France]] in 1918, but continued to claim the throne until his death in [[Antibes]] three years later. He was buried in Italy. In 1989, the remains of Nikola, his queen Milena, and two of their twelve children were re-buried in Montenegro.

Gatsby duly presents the medal for his guest to examine which reads on the legend ''Montenegro, Nicolas Rex'' and on its reverse: ''Major Jay Gatsby - For Valour Extraordinary''.<ref name="Fiction">{{cite book |last=Fitzgerald |first=F.
