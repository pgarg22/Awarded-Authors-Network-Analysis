==Critical Writing==
Hofmann has a reputation for writing negative review essays. [[Philip Oltermann]] remarks on the "savagery" with which Hofmann "can wield a hatchet", stating (with reference to Hofmann's dislike for [[Stefan Zweig]]) that: "Like a Soho drunk stumbling into the National Portrait Gallery in search of a good scrap, Hofmann has battered posthumous reputations with the same glee as those of the living."<ref>{{cite web| title =English is basically a trap| date =9 April 2016| url =https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/09/books-interview-michael-hofmann-anglo-german-poet-critic-translator}}</ref>
