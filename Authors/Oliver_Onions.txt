He was married to the novelist [[Berta Ruck]].

==Personal life==
George Oliver Onions was born on 13 November 1873 in [[Bradford]], Yorkshire, England, to George Frederick Onions, a bank cashier (born 1847, London, England) and Emily Alice Fearnley (born 1850, Scholes, Yorkshire, England).<ref>England Census 1881</ref>&nbsp; He studied art for three years in London at the National Arts Training Schools (now the [[Royal College of Art]]).&nbsp; In the book ''Twentieth Century Authors'', Onions described his interests as [[wikt:motoring|motoring]] and science; he was also an amateur boxer as a young man.<ref name="k&h"/>

In 1909, Onions married the writer [[Berta Ruck]] (1878–1978) and they had two sons: Arthur (born 1912) and William (born 1913).<ref name="k&h"/> In 1918, he legally changed his name to George Oliver, but continued to publish under the name Oliver Onions.

He died on 9 April 1961 in [[Aberystwyth]], Wales.

==Writing career==
[[File:Oliver Onions 001.jpg|thumb|Oliver Onions ca. 1915]]
Originally trained as a [[commercial artist]], he worked as a designer of posters and books and as a magazine illustrator during the [[Boer War]]. Encouraged by the American writer [[Gelett Burgess]], Onions began writing fiction.<ref name="k&h"/> The first editions of his novels were published with dust jackets bearing full-colour illustrations painted by Onions himself.<ref name="k&h"/>

''Poor Man's Tapestry'' (1946) and its prequel, ''Arras of Youth'' (1949) are about the adventures of a juggler, Robert Gandelyn, in the 14th century.<ref name="bm">"Recent Fiction by "B.M"" (Review of ''Arras of Youth''), ''The Irish Times'', 23 July 1949.</ref> ''The Story of Ragged Robyn'' (1945) focuses on the adventures of the titular stonemason at the end of the 17th century.<ref>F.

Onions wrote several collections focusing on [[ghost story|ghost stories]] and other [[weird fiction]]. The best known of these collections is ''Widdershins'' (1911).<ref>"Another author of weird fiction associated with the Edwardian period is Oliver Onions (1873–1961), an erstwhile illustrator who began writing for the periodicals in the 1890s, publishing his first novel in 1900." James Machin, ''Weird Fiction in Britain, 1880-1939''. Cham, Switzerland: Palgrave Macmillan, 2018 {{ISBN|9783319905266}}, p. 85.</ref><ref name="kn">[[Keith Neilson]], "Collected Ghost Stories of Oliver Onions, The" in [[Frank N. Magill]], ed. ''Survey of Modern Fantasy Literature'', Vol 1. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Salem Press, Inc., 1983. (pp.294–299). {{ISBN|0-89356-450-8}}</ref><ref name="nd">[[Norman Donaldson]], "Oliver Onions", in E. F. Bleiler, ed. ''Supernatural Fiction Writers''. New York: Scribner's, 1985. pp. 505–512 {{ISBN|0684178087}}.</ref> It includes the novella "[[The Beckoning Fair One]]", widely placed among the best in the genre of [[horror fiction]], especially [[psychological horror]].<ref name=kn/> On the surface, it is a conventional haunted house story: an unsuccessful writer moves into rooms in an otherwise empty house, in the hope that isolation will help his failing creativity. His sensitivity and imagination are enhanced by his seclusion, but his art, his only friend and his sanity are all destroyed in the process. The story can be read as narrating the gradual possession of the protagonist by a mysterious and possessive feminine spirit, or as a realistic description of a [[psychotic]] outbreak culminating in [[catatonia]] and murder, told from the psychotic subject's point of view. The precise description of the slow disintegration of the protagonist's mind is terrifying in either case.

A theme that "The Beckoning Fair One" shares with others of Onions's stories is a connection between creativity and insanity; here the artist is in danger of withdrawing from the world altogether and losing himself in his creation.<ref name="nd"/> Another noted story from ''Widdershins'' is "Rooum", about an engineer pursued by a mysterious entity.<ref name="nd"/><ref name="ma">[[Mike Ashley (writer)|Mike Ashley]], "Oliver Onions:The Man at the Edge" in [[Darrell Schweitzer]], ed. ''Discovering Classic Horror Fiction I'', Starmont House, pp. 120–126. {{ISBN|1-55742-084-X}}</ref> Other ghost stories such as "The Cigarette Case", "The Rosewood Door" and "The Rope in the Rafters" involve time and identity shifts.<ref name="ma2">Mike Ashley, "Onions,Oliver ", [[S. T. Joshi]] and Dziemianowicz, ed. ''Supernatural Literature of the World: an encyclopedia''. Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0313327742}}, pp. 874–875).</ref>

The title novella of ''The Painted Face'' (1929) concerns a Greek girl's [[reincarnation]] of an ancient spirit; [[Mike Ashley (writer)|Mike Ashley]] describes it as "one of the finest works in the genre".<ref name=ma/> The collection also contains "The Master of the House", a story involving a [[werewolf]] and [[black magic]].<ref name="nd"/>

A long supernatural horror novel is ''The Hand of Kornelius Voyt'', about an isolated boy who falls under the [[psychic]] influence of a mysterious man.<ref name="ma2"/> Onions was awarded the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for his 1946 novel ''Poor Man's Tapestry''.<ref name="k&h"/>

==Reception and influence==
Onions' work has largely been well received. [[Gahan Wilson]] ranked him as "one of the best, if not the best, ghost story writers working in the English language. ... Mr. Onions did as much as anyone to move phantoms and other haunts from dark, Gothic dungeons to the very room in which you presently sit."<ref>"Books", ''[[F&SF]]'', May 1973, pp. 75–76.</ref> Discussing ghost stories, [[Algernon Blackwood]] described "The Beckoning Fair One" as "the most horrible and beautiful ever written on those lines".<ref name=ma /> [[J. B. Priestley]] described ''Widdershins'' as a "book of fine creepy stories".<ref>J. B. Priestley, ''The Edwardians'', Harper and Row, 1970, p. 129.</ref> Fellow ghost story writer [[A. M. Burrage]] said of Onions' work, "There is some hair-raising stuff in ''Widdershins''", and added "there is great literary excellence in this book, besides satisfaction for the mere seeker after thrills."<ref>A. M. Burrage, "The Supernatural in Fiction", ''The Home Magazine'', October 1921. Reprinted in Burrage, ''Someone in the Room: Strange Tales Old and New'', ed. Jack Adrian. Ashcroft, B.C. : [[Ash-Tree Press]], 1997 {{ISBN|9781899562381}}.</ref> [[Robert Aickman]] named "The Beckoning Fair One" as "one of the (possibly) six great masterpieces in the field".<ref name=ma/> [[E. F. Bleiler]] lauded ''Widdershins'' as "a landmark book in the history of supernatural fiction".<ref>E. F. Bleiler, ''The Guide to Supernatural Fiction'', Kent State University Press, 1983, p. 392.</ref> [[Clemence Dane]] stated of Onions, "His books have a lasting attraction for a reader who enjoys using his brains and his imagination."<ref name="k&h"/> An ''Irish Times'' review of ''Arras of Youth'' stated, "Mr. Onions writes limpid and often beautiful prose."<ref name="bm"/> [[Martin Seymour-Smith]] described Onions's ''Whom God Hath Sundered'' trilogy as a neglected classic: "''In Accordance with the Evidence'' is the masterpiece of the three, but the other sequels in no way disgrace it."<ref>Martin Seymour-Smith, "Forgotten Classic". ''Scotland on Sunday'', 22 February 1998, p. 26.)</ref> Neil Wilson calls Onions' supernatural works "notable for their depth of psychological insight, elegant writing and sophisticated plots". Wilson notes that
<blockquote>'The Beckoning Fair One' (1911) is regarded by many as one of the greatest English tales of the supernatural but has overshadowed Onions' other work in the genre which some consider of equal, if not greater, importance. In fact, the majority of the author's supernatural fiction is of an extremely high standard and is notable for its originality, subtlety and careful characterizations which lift it well above the average.<ref>Neil Wilson, ''Shadows in the Attic: A Guide to British supernatural fiction, 1820–1950'' British Library, London, 2000. {{ISBN|0712310746}}, p. 298.</ref></blockquote>

On the other hand, [[H. P. Lovecraft|H.P. Lovecraft's]] assessment of Onions' work was negative; in a 1936 letter to [[J. Vernon Shea]], Lovecraft stated, "I have Onions' ''Ghosts in Daylight''. ... I didn't care much for the various tales."<ref>[[S. T. Joshi]] (2002) ''Lovecraft's Library: A Catalogue'', p. 108, Hippocampus Press {{ISBN|0967321573}}.</ref>

[[Karl Edward Wagner]]'s short story, "In the Pines" (1973) pays homage to Onions's "The Beckoning Fair One".<ref>"The tale is a retelling of sorts of Oliver Onions' classic ghost story 'The Beckoning Fair One' (which Wagner references in his story) and it shows how well Wagner understood the mechanics of the horror tale." Stefan Dziemianowicz, [http://www.locusmag.com/Reviews/2012/05/stefan-dziemianowicz-reviews-karl-edward-wagner/ Review of ''Where the Summer Ends'' and ''Walk on the Wild Side'' by Karl Edward Wagner]. Locus Magazine, 13 May 2012. Retrieved 24 December 2012.</ref> "The Beckoning Fair One" was also the inspiration for a 1968 Italian/French horror film called ''[[A Quiet Place in the Country]]''. [[Russell Hoban]] alludes to Onions' work in his books ''Her Name Was Lola'' and ''Amaryllis Night and Day''.<ref>"He also references Gothic writers who have influenced him, such as [[Margaret Oliphant]] and Oliver Onions". Review of ''Her Name Was Lola'' by Russell Hoban. ''[[The Times]]'', 8 November 2003, p. 14.</ref>
