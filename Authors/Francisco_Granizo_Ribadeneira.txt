'''Francisco Granizo Ribadeneira''' (1925–2009) was an [[Ecuadorian]] poet born in [[Quito]] on November 8, 1925 and died on January 21, 2009. For some, he was considered a model for Ecuadorian ''religious lyrical poetry;'' <ref>Rodríguez Castelo, H. (1979), Lírica ecuatoriana contemporánea, Bogotá: Círculo de Lectores.</ref> his work surpasses an exact classification and in more than one occasion, it has been categorized as "intense poetry", a middle ground between [[eroticism]], [[mysticism]] , and [[existentialism]].<ref>Calvopina, J. (2008), La coincidencia imposible: análisis narratológico de la novela La piscina, del escritor quiteño Francisco Granizo Ribadeneira, Quito: PUCE</ref>

Of him, the critic [[Hernán Rodríguez Castelo]]: says, "I think that in a selection of the best Ecuadorian poets of this century, if there were ten or less, you couldn't miss Granizo. An exemplary and sustained lyrical trajectory, increasingly deeper and higher, has left him as the highest place within the slope of the current Ecuadorian lyrical poetry."<ref>Rodríguez Castelo, H. (1979), Lírica ecuatoriana contemporánea, Bogotá: Círculo de Lectores.(p.268)</ref>

Granizo studied in San Gabriel High School and afterwards he continued his studies with a major in [[Law]] at the [[Central University of Ecuador]]. As a university student, he won the gold medal in a poetic competition in [[Riobamba]]. He was a renowned diplomat and he became the alternate representative before the OEA and responsible for business in [[Venezuela]] and [[Chile]]. Additionally, he worked as a professor in the Central University and directed the radio station of the [[Ecuadorian Cultural House]].

He has published several books of poems ''By the Short Dust'' (1948), ''The Rock'' (1958), ''Nothing more than the verb'' (1969), ''Death and pursuit of death'' (1978), ''Sonets of total love and other poems'' (1990) and ''The Sound of your steps'' (2005); additionally to the novel ''The Pool'' (2002) and the dramatic poem ''Fedro'' (2005).<ref>Carvajal, I.
