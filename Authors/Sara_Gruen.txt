Gruen is an animal lover; both her first novel, ''Riding Lessons'', and her second novel, ''Flying Changes'', involve horses. Gruen's third book, the 1930s circus drama ''[[Water for Elephants]]'', was initially turned down by her publisher at the time, Avon Books; as a result, Gruen found another publisher, [[Workman Publishing Company#Algonquin Books|Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill]].<ref name="nytimes">{{Cite news |last=Rich |first=Notoko |date=2007-07-11 |title=Big Time for a Novel Set Under the Big Top |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/11/books/11elep.html?_r=1&8dpc&oref=slogin |url-status=live |url-access=registration |access-date=2007-12-23 |archive-url=http://archive.today/2013.01.30-161518/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/11/books/11elep.html?_r=2&8dpc&oref=slogin& |archive-date=30 January 2013}}</ref> It went on to become a [[New York Times]] bestseller and is now available in 45 languages and as a 2011 [[Water for Elephants (film)|film adaptation]] starring [[Reese Witherspoon]], [[Christoph Waltz]], and [[Robert Pattinson]].<ref name="officialsite" /> Her fourth novel, ''[[Ape House]]'', centers around the [[Bonobo]] ape<ref name="officialsite" /> and was sold to Spiegel & Grau on the basis of a 12-page summary.<ref name="nytimes" /> ''Ape House'' is published by [[Two Roads Books]].

==Involvement with the Charles Murdoch case==
In June 2015, Gruen received a letter from Charles Murdoch, an inmate at a California prison.<ref name="Kahler2021">{{Cite news |last=Kahler |first=Abbott |date=24 March 2021 |title=How Sara Gruen Lost Her Life |publisher=New York Magazine |url=https://www.vulture.com/article/sara-gruen-charles-murdoch.html |url-status=live |access-date=24 March 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210329153714/https://www.vulture.com/article/sara-gruen-charles-murdoch.html |archive-date=29 March 2021}}</ref> Murdoch is serving a life sentence without parole for murder. His letter praised ''Water for Elephants'' and also described the circumstances of his case. He told Gruen that former chief justice [[Alex Kozinski]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] “described my (wrongful) conviction as ‘a truly spectacular [[miscarriage of justice]].’”<ref>Murdoch v. Castro, 609 F.3d 983, 1009 (9th Cir. 2010)</ref> Murdoch's conviction was upheld by the [[California Courts of Appeal|California Court of Appeal]] despite Kozinski's doubts that he had received a fair trial. Gruen began to correspond with Murdoch and took up the cause of attempting to overturn his conviction, believing Murdoch's prosecution to have depended on a coerced confession by witness Dino Dinardo. She hired attorneys and investigators at her own expense, including former [[Los Angeles district attorney|Los Angeles District Attorney's]] Office prosecutor [[Robin Sax]],<ref name="Kahler2021" /> eventually spending more than half a million dollars on her fight to free Murdoch.{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}} Despite her efforts, Murdoch remains incarcerated, waiting for a response from the Los Angeles County’s Conviction Review Unit.<ref name="Kahler2021" />

In Gruen's own words, the effort to exonerate Murdoch has left her "absolutely broke", as she borrowed money against her home, and "seriously ill", with her writing work "years past deadline". Fearful of threats to her life, real or imagined, she left her home in spring 2018 and moved repeatedly to avoid being tracked, though she eventually returned to Asheville.<ref name="Kahler2021" />

==Personal life==
Gruen lives in [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]], [[North Carolina]] with her husband, the youngest of her three<ref name="Kahler2021" /> sons,<ref name="writersdigest">{{Cite news |last=Rosenfeld |first=Jordan |date=2008-04-22 |title=The WD Interview: Sara Gruen |publisher=Writers Digest |url=http://www.writersdigest.com/article/sara-gruen/ |url-status=live |access-date=2011-04-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201001160114/https://www.writersdigest.com/literary-fiction-by-writing-genre/sara-gruen |archive-date=1 October 2020}}</ref> and numerous pets, including horses Tia and Fancy.<ref name="Kahler2021" />
