'''Royce Thomas Carlisle Ryton''' (16 September 1924 &ndash; 14 April 2009<ref>[http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/24126/playwright-royce-ryton-dies-aged-84 "Playwright Royce Ryton dies aged 84"], ''The Stage'', 16 April 2009</ref>) was an [[England|English]] [[playwright]]. He was educated at Lancing College. During the war he served in the Royal Navy; afterward, he went to train as an actor at the [[Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art]]. As an actor, he played in many repertory theatres, including Bromley, Minehead, and [[Connaught Theatre|Worthing]]. He also toured extensively. Over the years he worked less as an actor so he could concentrate on his writing. Initially, he had some success with comedies (which were particularly well received in Germany), but later he became fascinated with the interaction of the private and public lives of royalty and politicians.

He was married to Morar Kennedy (sister of [[Ludovic Kennedy]]) from 1954 until his death, aged 84; they have a daughter, Charlotte. Morar has a son, Roderick Orr-Ewing, from her first marriage.

With ''Crown Matrimonial'' (1972), Ryton achieved an historical first â€” the serious portrayal of a living member of the Royal Family ([[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]]) on the stage. It is about the [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|Abdication crisis]] of 1936. The play was Ryton's most successful work and has been performed on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and the [[London West End]]. In the West End, the central portrayals of [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] and [[Edward VIII]] were played by [[Wendy Hiller]] and [[Peter Barkworth]].<ref>Michael Coveney [https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/apr/18/obituary-royce-ryton Obituary: Royce Ryton], ''The Guardian'', 18 April 2009</ref> Most recently Queen Mary was played by [[Patricia Routledge]].

Ryton continued his 'Royal-theme' in 1981 with the comedy (co-written with [[Ray Cooney]]), ''[[Her Royal Highness..? (play)|Her Royal Highness]]'', about a double having to stand-in for [[Lady Diana Spencer]] when she loses her nerve and disappears, one week before the [[Wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer|Royal Wedding]]. It ran successfully at the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]] in London's [[West End theatre|West End]] from 1981 to 1982.
