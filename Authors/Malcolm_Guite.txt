'''Ayodeji Malcolm Guite''' ({{IPAc-en|g|aɪ|t}}; born 12 November 1957) is an English poet, singer-songwriter, [[Anglican priest]], and academic. Born in Nigeria to British [[expatriate]] parents, Guite earned degrees from [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[Durham University|Durham]] universities. His research interests include the intersection of religion and the arts, and the examination of the works of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[C. S. Lewis]], [[Owen Barfield]], and British poets such as [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]. He was a [[Bye-Fellow]] and [[chaplain]] of [[Girton College, Cambridge]] and associate chaplain of [[St Edward King and Martyr, Cambridge|St Edward King and Martyr]] in Cambridge. On several occasions, he has taught as visiting faculty at several colleges and universities in England and [[North America]].

Guite is the author of five books of poetry, including two [[chapbook]]s and three full-length [[List of poetry collections|collections]], as well as several books on Christian faith and theology. Guite has a decisively simple, formalist style in poems, many of which are [[sonnet]]s, and he stated that his aim is to "be profound without ceasing to be beautiful".<ref name="DarlingInterview" /> Guite performs as a singer and guitarist fronting the Cambridgeshire-based blues, rhythm and blues, and rock band "Mystery Train".<ref name="MysteryTrain">[http://www.mysterytrain.org.uk/ Mystery Train] (official website).

== Early life and education ==
Guite was born on 12 November 1957 in [[Ibadan]], [[Oyo State]], in Nigeria. At birth, he was given the first name ''Ayodeji'' which is a [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] tribal name meaning "the second joy".<ref name="DarlingInterview">Nathaniel Darling, [http://www.tcs.cam.ac.uk/interviews/0032210-interview-reverend-dr-malcolm-guite-girton.html Interview: Reverend Dr Malcolm Guite, Girton], ''The Cambridge Student'' (25 April 2014). Retrieved 20 July 2015.</ref><ref name="SmithInterview">Lancia E. Smith, [https://lanciaesmith.com/interview-series-with-malcolm-guite-part-1/ Interview Series with Malcolm Guite, Part 1], ''Cultivating The Good, The True, & the Beautiful'' (1 May 2012). Retrieved 19 July 2015.</ref> According to Guite, the name was suggested to his mother by the Yoruba nurse who attended to her through a difficult [[childbirth]] and whom Guite states probably saved both his and his mother's life.<ref name="SmithInterview" /> His parents were British expatriates living in Nigeria where his father was a [[Methodist]] [[lay preacher]] who travelled around the country evangelising. His father also taught as lecturer in [[Classics]] at the [[University of Ibadan]].<ref name="SmithInterview" /> According to Guite, after ten years in Nigeria, his father "ever the wanderer, went and got a job in Canada, where we then moved".<ref name="DarlingInterview" />

Although his family had settled in Canada, his parents thought he was losing his British identity and decided to enrol him in boarding school in England where he spent his teenage years.<ref name="DarlingInterview" /> He attended the [[Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School]] in [[Elstree]], [[Hertfordshire]]. He would describe the boarding school experience as terrible, an "atmosphere of guilt, oppression and general alienation" where he strayed from his childhood Christian faith.<ref name="SmithInterview" /> In its place, Guite embraced a "rational scientific materialism" coloured by [[B.F. Skinner]]'s [[behaviourism]] and the [[existentialism]] of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Samuel Beckett]].<ref name="SmithInterview" />

During these years, Guite states that he was not sure whether he belonged in England or in Canada, having questions about how he identified himself. In the end, however, he decided that he belonged in England after winning a scholarship to [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]] to read English and after discovering "[[real ale]]"—something he says "they don't have properly in Canada at all".<ref name="DarlingInterview" /> Guite adds that after these two events he "fell in love with Cambridge, and I've never quite escaped its gravitational pull".<ref name="DarlingInterview" /> Guite returned gradually to his Christian faith, first under the influence of beauty in the poetry of [[John Keats]] and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] and visits to historical sites that had deep religious significance—[[Rome]], Glen Colmcille, and Scotland's [[Iona]].<ref name="SmithInterview" /> After delving into the works of Keats and Shelley, Guite decided to begin writing poetry.<ref name="SmithInterview" /> In his final year of undergraduate study, Guite states that he had a religious experience writing a literary paper analysing the [[Psalms]] that he likened to a [[Religious conversion|conversion experience]].<ref name="SmithInterview" /> He chose to be confirmed in the [[Church of England]] shortly after.<ref name="SmithInterview" />

Guite graduated from Cambridge with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (BA)—later automatically upgraded to [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]] (MA (Cantab))—in [[English Literature]] in 1980.<ref name="GirtonBio">Girton College, University of Cambridge, [http://www.girton.cam.ac.uk/guite-revd-malcolm Malcolm Guite, Chaplain] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706063840/http://www.girton.cam.ac.uk/guite-revd-malcolm |date=6 July 2015 }} (faculty page). Retrieved 19 July 2015.</ref> After graduating, Guite taught for several years as a secondary school teacher before deciding to seek a doctoral degree, and obtained his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD) from [[Durham University]] degree in 1993.<ref name="GirtonBio" /> His doctoral [[dissertation]] focused on "the centrality of memory as a theme in the sermons and meditations of [[Lancelot Andrewes]] and [[John Donne]] and to explore the extent of their influence on the treatment of memory in [[T.S. Eliot]]{{'}}s poetry".<ref name="GuitePhDdiss">Ayodeji Malcolm Guite, ''[http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/1705/ The art of memory and the art of salvation : a study with reference to the works of Lancelot Andrewes, John Donne and T.S.Elliot]'' (sic) (Durham theses, Durham University, 1993), quote from "Abstract".</ref> While researching the topic of his dissertation, in considering the struggles of John Donne with a similar question in the early seventeenth-century, Guite began to wonder if God was calling him too to be a priest.<ref name="SmithInterview" />

== Career ==
Guite was ordained as a priest in the [[Church of England]] in 1991.<ref>Crockford'Clerical Directory</ref> As a deacon he was first assigned to a [[parish]] on "the [[Oxmoor, Huntingdon|Oxmoor]] estate in [[Huntingdon]]".<ref name="DarlingInterview" /><ref name="EvansInterview">Jules Evans, [http://www.philosophyforlife.org/malcolm-guite-on-poetry-as-a-door-into-the-dark/ Malcolm Guite on poetry as a door into the dark] at ''Philosophy for Life and Other Dangerous Situations''. Retrieved 20 July 2015.</ref> He described this period as not having much time for writing sonnets, saying: "being a priest and a poet feels a very natural combination now. It didn’t at first".<ref name="DarlingInterview" />  He put poetry aside for seven years, "in order to concentrate on and learn deeply my priestly vocation, and life in my parishes was totally absorbing and demanding so it felt right to let the other fields lie fallow".<ref name="SmithInterviewP2">Lancia E.

Guite teaches in the pastoral theology graduate programme at the [[Cambridge Theological Federation]] where he frequently advises "clergy who are returning to academia to do a dissertation to reflect on their often amazing parish experiences". Since 2003 has been chaplain and Bye-Fellow of [[Girton College, Cambridge]].<ref name="GirtonBio" /> Guite also lectures regularly in the United States and Canada, including visiting positions at [[Duke University]] [[Duke Divinity School|Divinity School]] and [[Regent College]].<ref name="GirtonBio" /><ref>Regent College, [http://www.regent-college.edu/faculty/part-time-and-visiting/malcolm-guite Faculty 02/Part-time and visiting: Malcolm Guite, Chaplain and teacher, University of Cambridge].

Tolkien]] and British poets.<ref name="GirtonBio" /> Since October 2014, Guite has been a visiting [[research fellow]] at [[St John's College, Durham|St John's College]], at Durham University.<ref>St Johns College, Durham, [https://www.dur.ac.uk/st-johns.college/research/fellows/malcolmguite/ Research: Fellows: Malcolm Guite].

<poem>
How hard to hear the things I think I know,
To peel aside the thin familiar film
That wraps and seals your secret just below:
An undiscovered good, a hidden realm,
A kingdom of reversal, where the poor
Are rich in blessing and the tragic rich
Still struggle, trapped in trappings at the door
They never opened, Life just out of reach...

Guite's poetry has been characterised as modern-day metaphysical poems and psalms.<ref name="UNCGHeavensTroubadour">University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Weatherspoon Art Museum, [http://weatherspoon.uncg.edu/eventcalendar/show/?title=503-heavens-troubadour-an-evening-of-poetry-and-song-with-malcolm-guite- "Heaven's Troubadour: An Evening of Poetry and Song with Malcolm Guite, Sep 11, 6:30pm-8pm"] (September 2014). Retrieved 8 August 2015.</ref> Guite's poetry tends to conform to traditional forms, especially the [[sonnet]], and employs both [[rhyme]] and [[Metre (poetry)|metre]]. The former [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Rowan Williams]], remarked that Guite "knows exactly how to use the sonnet form to powerful effect" and that his poems "offer deep resources for prayer and meditation to the reader".<ref name="MGWilliamsLindop">Malcolm Guite, quoting Rowan Williams and Grevel Lindop, in [https://malcolmguite.wordpress.com/2012/11/23/kind-words-from-rowan-williams/ "Kind Words From Rowan Williams"] at Malcolm Guite (blog), 23 November 2012.

Note: Both quotes appear as blurbs on the cover of Guite's ''Sounding the Seasons'' (Canterbury Press Norwich, 2012).</ref><ref name="Sarum">Sebastian Snook, [http://www.sarum.ac.uk/poetry-reading-and-book-launch-with-malcolm-guite "Poetry Reading and Book Launch with Malcolm Guite"], Sarum College, 19 December 2014. Retrieved 8 August 2015.</ref> Concerning Guite's collection ''Sounding the Seasons'', poet and literary critic [[Grevel Lindop]] remarked: "using the sonnet form with absolute naturalness as he traces the year and its festivals, he offers the reader—whether Christian or not—profound and beautiful utterance which is patterned but also refreshingly spontaneous".<ref name="MGWilliamsLindop" /><ref name="Sarum" /> Guite has stated that his aim is to "be profound without ceasing to be beautiful".<ref name="DarlingInterview" /> Further he has argued that a poet can discuss emotions like sorrow without having to lose form, and specifically that the goal of his style contrasts a lot of modern poetry which he states tends to be "quite difficult, jagged and rebarbative; a lot of modern poetry deliberately eschews form or beauty, and is almost deliberately trying to put the reader off."<ref name="DarlingInterview" /> Citing these difficulties, Guite recounted that his entry into poetry was aided by engaging the lyrics of singer-songwriters [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Leonard Cohen]].<ref name="DarlingInterview" />

[[Houston Baptist University]] professor Holly Ordway writes that "Guite helps us see clearly and deeply how poetry allows us to know truth in a different but complementary way to propositional, rational argument" in her review of ''Faith, Hope, and Poetry: Theology and the Poetic Imagination''.<ref>Holly Ordway, [http://www.hieropraxis.com/faith-hope-and-poetry-malcolm-guite/ "Faith, Hope and Poetry by Malcolm Guite: Book Review"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304093153/http://www.hieropraxis.com/faith-hope-and-poetry-malcolm-guite/ |date=4 March 2016 }}, heiropraxis.com, 1 July 2011. Retrieved 8 August 2015.</ref> In a review of Guite's collection ''The Singing Bowl'', Kevin Belmonte, a ''[[Huffington Post]]'' contributor who has written biographies of [[William Wilberforce]] and [[G. K. Chesterton]], describes Guite as a "questing poet" whose poems "point to places of possibility—in everything—from the commonplace to the transcendent" and explore "what it means to persist in the presence of a God who hears and knows us in time of trouble".<ref>Kevin Belmonte, [http://www.hieropraxis.com/many-splendored-things-a-review-of-the-singing-bowl-by-malcolm-guite/ "Many-Splendored Things: a Review of The Singing Bowl by Malcolm Guite"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924030041/http://www.hieropraxis.com/many-splendored-things-a-review-of-the-singing-bowl-by-malcolm-guite/ |date=24 September 2015 }}, heiropraxis.com, 4 December 2013.

Guite has commented in interviews that he has been influenced by the works of poets [[Seamus Heaney]], [[T. S. Eliot]], and [[George Herbert]], and that he holds Herbert's poem "Bitter-Sweet" dearly. In discussing the impact Herbert's poem has on his views, he said "what I see Herbert saying in that poem is that we take our passions, and sometimes our faults and our brokenness and our stains, and we let God [[Annealing (glass)|anneal]] his story. So there's some point in which we become a window of grace".<ref name="DukeMGenshrined">Duke Divinity School, [http://www.faithandleadership.com/qa/malcolm-guite-church-poetry-enshrined-the-heart Malcolm Guite: Church with poetry enshrined at the heart], ''Faith & Leadership'' (20 July 2009).

I'm the same person in all three."<ref name="DukeMGenshrined" /> On 11 September 2014, Guite headlined a poetry reading as part of an art exhibition at the [[University of North Carolina at Greensboro]]{{'}}s [[Weatherspoon Art Museum]]. In the promotional materials for the event, organizers asked—describing the poet—"What would happen if John Donne or George Herbert journeyed to Middle Earth by way of San Francisco, took musical cues from Jerry Garcia and fashion tips from Bilbo Baggins, and rode back on a Harley?"<ref name="UNCGHeavensTroubadour" />
