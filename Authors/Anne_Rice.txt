She is best known for her series of novels ''[[The Vampire Chronicles]]''. Books from ''The Vampire Chronicles'' were the subject of two film adaptations—''[[Interview with the Vampire (film)|Interview with the Vampire]]'' (1994) and ''[[Queen of the Damned (film)|Queen of the Damned]]'' (2002).

Born in [[New Orleans]], Rice spent much of her early life there before moving to Texas, and later to [[San Francisco]]. She was raised in an observant [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] family but became an [[agnostic]] as a young adult. She began her professional writing career with the publication of ''[[Interview with the Vampire]]'' in 1976, while living in California, and began writing sequels to the novel in the 1980s. In the mid-2000s, following a publicized return to Catholicism, Rice published the novels ''[[Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt]]'' and ''[[Christ the Lord: The Road to Cana]]'', fictionalized accounts of certain incidents in the life of [[Jesus]]. Several years later she distanced herself from organized Christianity, citing disagreement with the Church's stances on social issues but pledging that faith in God remained "central to [her] life." However, she now considers herself a [[secular humanist]].<ref name="Secular Humanist">{{cite web|last=Rice|first=Anne|title=Anne Rice|url=https://www.facebook.com/annericefanpage/posts/10151623323420452|publisher=Facebook.com|access-date=April 26, 2014|date=April 14, 2013|quote=What do the words, "secular humanism," mean to you?

In addition to her vampire novels, Rice has authored books such as ''[[The Feast of All Saints (novel)|The Feast of All Saints]]'' (adapted for television in 2001) and ''[[Servant of the Bones]]'', which formed the basis of a 2011 [[comic book]] miniseries. Several books from ''The Vampire Chronicles'' have been adapted as comics and manga by various publishers. Rice has also authored erotic fiction under the pen names Anne Rampling and A.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;Roquelaure, including ''[[Exit to Eden]]'', which was later adapted into a [[Exit to Eden (film)|1994 film]].

==Early life==

===New Orleans and Texas===
Born in [[New Orleans]], Rice is the second of four daughters of parents of [[Irish American|Irish]] [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] descent, Howard O'Brien and Katherine "Kay" Allen O'Brien.<ref name="Telegraph">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/donotmigrate/3562792/Anne-Rice-interview-with-the-vampire-writer.html|title=Anne Rice: interview with the vampire writer|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=November 2, 2008|access-date=September 11, 2010|first=Stuart|last=Husband|location=London|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171213042527/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/donotmigrate/3562792/Anne-Rice-interview-with-the-vampire-writer.html|archive-date=December 13, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Her father, a Naval veteran of World War II and lifelong resident of New Orleans, worked as a Personnel Executive for the [[U.S. Postal Service]],<ref name="Father Obit" /> and authored one novel, ''The Impulsive Imp'', which was published posthumously.<ref name="Imp review">{{cite web|title=THE IMPULSIVE IMP by Howard O'Brien|url=http://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/indie/howard-obrien/the-impulsive-imp/#review|publisher=Kirkus Reviews|access-date=June 10, 2012}}</ref><ref name="Chamber Imp">{{cite web|last=Rice|first=Anne|title=The Impulsive Imp|url=http://www.annerice.com/Chamber-Imp.html|publisher=Anne Rice|work=AnneRice.com|access-date=June 10, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716185217/http://www.annerice.com/Chamber-Imp.html|archive-date=July 16, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Her older sister, [[Alice Borchardt]], later became a noted author of [[fantasy]] and [[horror fiction]].

Rice spent most of her youth in New Orleans, which forms the backdrop against which many of her works are set. She and her family lived in the rented home of her maternal grandmother, Alice Allen, known as "Mamma Allen," at 2301 St. Charles Avenue in the [[Irish Channel, New Orleans|Irish Channel]], which Rice says was widely considered a "Catholic Ghetto".<ref name=Busted>{{cite web|last=McGarvey|first=Bill|title=Busted: Anne Rice|date=November 22, 2005|url=http://www.bustedhalo.com/features/busted-anne-rice/2|publisher=Busted Halo|access-date=June 10, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722014053/http://bustedhalo.com/features/busted-anne-rice/2|archive-date=July 22, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="Frommer's">{{cite web|title=Special-Interest Sightseeing: Anne Rice's New Orleans|url=http://www.frommers.com/destinations/neworleans/0020020185.html|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|access-date=June 19, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110322032212/http://www.frommers.com/destinations/neworleans/0020020185.html|archive-date=March 22, 2011|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Allen, who began working as a domestic shortly after separating from her alcoholic husband, was an important early influence in Rice's life, keeping the family and household together as Rice's mother sank deeper into alcoholism. Allen died in 1949, but the O'Briens remained in her home until 1956, when they moved to 2524 St. Charles Avenue, a former rectory, convent, and school owned by the parish, to be closer to both the church and support for Katherine's addiction.<ref>Ramsland 1991, pp. 34–35</ref> As a young child, Rice studied at St. Alphonsus School, a Catholic institution previously attended by her father.<ref name="Busted" />

About her unusual given name, Rice said:

{{blockquote|Well, my birth name is Howard Allen because apparently my mother thought it was a good idea to name me Howard. My father's name was Howard, she wanted to name me after Howard, and she thought it was a very interesting thing to do. She was a bit of a [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]], a bit of mad woman, a bit of a genius, and a great deal of a great teacher. And she had the idea that naming a woman Howard was going to give that woman an unusual advantage in the world.<ref name=Answered>{{cite web|last=Rice |first=Anne |title=You Asked, Anne Answered |url=http://www.annerice.com/ques_per.htm#howard |publisher=Kith and Kin, LLC. |work=AnneRice.com |access-date=June 15, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19981205061038/http://www.annerice.com/ques_per.htm |archive-date=December 5, 1998 }}</ref>}}

However, according to the authorized biography ''Prism of the Night'', by [[Katherine Ramsland]], Rice's father was the source of his daughter's birth name: "Thinking back to the days when his own name had been associated with girls, and perhaps in an effort to give it away, Howard named the little girl Howard Allen Frances O'Brien."<ref>Ramsland 1991. p. 10</ref> Rice became "Anne" on her first day of school, when a nun asked her what her name was. She told the nun "Anne," which she considered a pretty name. Her mother, who was with her, let it go without correcting her, knowing how self-conscious her daughter was of her real name. From that day on, everyone she knew addressed her as "Anne",<ref>{{YouTube|OhzKP9SxSLQ|Interview "Called Out Of Darkness: Part 1: An Anne Rice Memoir" ''annerice.com channel,'' September 19, 2008}}</ref><ref name="Chamber Bio">{{cite web|last=Rice|first=Anne|title=Biography|url=http://www.annerice.com/Chamber-Biography.html|work=AnneRice.com|publisher=Anne Rice|access-date=June 22, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223061622/http://annerice.com/Chamber-Biography.html|archive-date=February 23, 2011|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and her name was legally changed in 1947.<ref name="Bowman" /> Rice was confirmed in the Catholic Church when she was twelve years old and took the full name Howard Allen Frances Alphonsus Liguori O'Brien,{{Clarify|reason=Wasn't she already legally Anne by that point, as implied by the previous sentence?|date=January 2020}} adding the names of a saint and of an aunt, who was a nun. "I was honored to have my aunt's name," she said, "but it was my burden and joy as a child to have strange names."<ref>Ramsland 1991, pp. 28, 44</ref>

Rice described St. Joseph's as "something out of [[Jane Eyre]] ... a dilapidated, awful, medieval type of place. I really hated it and wanted to leave.

===San Francisco and Berkeley===
Graduating from Richardson High in 1959, Rice completed her freshman year at [[Texas Woman's University]] in [[Denton, Texas|Denton]] and transferred to [[University of North Texas|North Texas State College]] for her sophomore year, but dropped out when she ran out of money and was unable to find employment.<ref>Ramsland 1991, pp. 66–67</ref> Soon after, she moved to [[San Francisco]] and stayed with the family of a friend until she found work as an insurance claims processor. She persuaded her former roommate from Texas Woman's University, Ginny Mathis, to join her, and they found an apartment in the [[Haight-Ashbury]] district. Mathis acquired a job at the same insurance company as Rice. Soon after, they began taking night courses at [[University of San Francisco]], an all-male [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] school that allowed women to take night courses. For Easter vacation Anne returned home to Texas, rekindling her relationship with Stan Rice. After her return to San Francisco, Stan Rice came for a week-long visit during summer break. He returned to Texas, Rice moved back in with the Percys, and Mathis left San Francisco in August to enroll in a nursing program in Oklahoma. Some time later, Anne received a special delivery letter from Stan Rice asking her to marry him. They married on October 14, 1961, in [[Denton, Texas]], soon after she turned twenty years old, and when he was just weeks from his nineteenth birthday.<ref>Ramsland 1991, pp.67–77</ref>

The Rices moved back to San Francisco in 1962, experiencing the birth of the [[Hippie]] movement firsthand as they lived in the soon-to-be fabled Haight-Ashbury district, [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], and later the [[The Castro, San Francisco|Castro District]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0723351/bio|title=Anne Rice|website=IMDb|access-date=2017-08-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180725215202/https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0723351/bio|archive-date=July 25, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> "I'm a totally conservative person," she later told ''[[The New York Times]]'', "In the middle of [[Haight-Ashbury]] in the 1960s, I was typing away while everybody was dropping acid and smoking grass.

===''Interview with the Vampire''===
In 1973, while still grieving the loss of her daughter (1966–1972), Rice took a previously written short story and [[Fix-up|turned it into]] her first novel, the bestselling ''[[Interview with the Vampire]]''. She based her vampires on [[Gloria Holden]]'s character in ''[[Dracula's Daughter]]'': "It established to me what vampires were—these elegant, tragic, sensitive people. I was really just going with that feeling when writing ''Interview With the Vampire''. I didn't do a lot of research."<ref name="Daily Beast">{{cite news|last=Stern|first=Marlow|title=Anne Rice on Sparkly Vampires, 'Twilight,' 'True Blood,' and Werewolves|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/11/23/anne-rice-on-sparkly-vampires-twilight-true-blood-and-werewolves.html|work=Book Beast|publisher=The Newsweek/Daily Beast Company LLC|date=November 23, 2011|access-date=August 7, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725055318/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/11/23/anne-rice-on-sparkly-vampires-twilight-true-blood-and-werewolves.html|archive-date=July 25, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> After completing the novel and following many rejections from publishers, Rice developed [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD). She became obsessed with germs, thinking that she contaminated everything she touched, engaged in frequent and obsessive hand washing and obsessively checked locks on windows and doors. Of this period, Rice says, "What you see when you're in that state is every single flaw in our hygiene and you can't control it and you go crazy."<ref>Ramsland 1991, pp. 157–158</ref>

In August 1974, after a year of therapy for her OCD, Rice attended the [[Squaw Valley Writer's Conference]] at [[Squaw Valley, Placer County, California|Squaw Valley]], conducted by writer [[Ray Nelson (author)|Ray Nelson]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Mackay|first=Kathleen|title=The Anne Rice Reader|date=February 11, 1997|publisher=Ballantine Books|isbn=978-0345402677|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/annericereader00kath|editor=Ramsland, Katherine|editor-link=Katherine Ramsland|access-date=April 26, 2014|chapter-format=Paperback|chapter=A Literary Friendship: Life Is Not A Footrace|quote='I remember what you were wearing,' Anne said recently, recalling our first meeting in August 1974.

In October 1974, Seidel sold the publishing rights to ''Interview with the Vampire'' to [[Alfred A. Knopf]] for a $12,000 advance of the hardcover rights, at a time when most new authors were receiving $2,000 advances.<ref>Ramsland 1991, pp. 159–160</ref> ''Interview with the Vampire'' was published in May 1976. In 1977, the Rices traveled to both Europe and Egypt for the first time.<ref name="Bio Channel" />

===Other works===
Following the publication of ''Interview with the Vampire'', while living in California, Rice wrote two historical novels, ''[[The Feast of All Saints (novel)|The Feast of All Saints]]'' and ''[[Cry to Heaven]]'', along with [[The Sleeping Beauty Trilogy|three erotic novels]] (''[[The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty]]'', ''[[Beauty's Punishment]]'', and ''[[Beauty's Release]]'') under the pseudonym A. N. Roquelaure, and two more under the pseudonym Anne Rampling (''[[Exit to Eden]]'' and ''[[Belinda (Anne Rice novel)|Belinda]]''). Rice then returned to the vampire genre with ''[[The Vampire Lestat]]'' and ''[[The Queen of the Damned]]'', her bestselling sequels to ''Interview with the Vampire''.

Shortly after her June 1988 return to New Orleans, Rice penned ''[[The Witching Hour (novel)|The Witching Hour]]'' as an expression of her joy at coming home. Rice also continued her popular ''[[Vampire Chronicles]]'' series, which later grew to encompass ten novels, and followed up on ''The Witching Hour'' with ''[[Lasher]]'' and ''[[Taltos (Rice novel)|Taltos]]'', completing the ''[[Lives of the Mayfair Witches]]'' trilogy. She also published ''[[Violin (novel)|Violin]]'', a tale of a ghostly haunting, in 1997.<ref name="Ramsland312-317">Ramsland 1991, pp. 312–317</ref>

Rice calls ''Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt'', published in 2005, the beginning of a series chronicling the life of [[Jesus]]. The second volume, ''[[Christ the Lord: The Road to Cana]]'', was published in March 2008. The third book in the series, ''Christ the Lord: Kingdom of Heaven'', has been postponed.

After moving to [[Rancho Mirage, California]], in December 2005, Rice wrote ''Christ the Lord: The Road to Cana'', ''[[Angel Time]]'', and ''[[Of Love and Evil]]'' (the latter two being the first two books in her ''Songs of the Seraphim'' series), in addition to her memoir, ''Called Out of Darkness: A Spiritual Confession''.

On March 9, 2014, Rice announced on her son Christopher's radio show, "The Dinner Party with Christopher Rice and Eric Shaw Quinn", that she had completed another book in the ''Vampire Chronicles'', titled, ''[[Prince Lestat]]'',<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/84069/prince-lestat-book/ |title=Prince Lestat (Book) |date=January 5, 2015 |access-date=January 5, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106020710/http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/84069/prince-lestat-book/ |archive-date=January 6, 2015 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> a "true sequel" to ''Queen of the Damned''.

==Reception and analysis==
Following its debut in 1976, ''[[Interview with the Vampire]]'' received many negative reviews from critics, causing Rice to retreat temporarily from the supernatural genre.<ref name="Ferraro" /> When ''[[The Vampire Lestat]]'' debuted in 1985, reaction—both from critics and from readers—was more positive, and the first [[hardcover]] edition of the book sold 75,000 copies.<ref name="Ferraro" /> Upon its publication in 1988, ''[[The Queen of the Damned]]'' was given an initial hardcover printing of 405,000 copies.<ref name="Ferraro" /> The novel was a main selection of the [[Literary Guild|Literary Guild of America]] for 1988,<ref name=Hunter>{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Jeffrey W.|title=Contemporary Literary Criticism|volume=128|date=2000|publisher=Gale Cengage|isbn=0787632031}}</ref> and reached the #1 spot on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]], staying on the list for more than four months.<ref name="Ferraro" />

Rice's novels are popular among many members of the [[LGBT+]] community, some of whom have perceived her vampire characters as [[Allegory|allegorical]] symbols of isolation and social alienation.<ref name="Ferraro" /> Similarly, a reviewer writing for ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' observed that the vampires of her novels represent "the walking alienated, those of us who, by choice or not, dwell on the fringe."<ref name="Day 2002, p. 43">Day 2002, p. 43</ref> On the subject, Rice herself commented, "From the beginning, I've had gay fans, and gay readers who felt that my works involved a sustained gay allegory ... I didn't set out to do that, but that was what they perceived. So even when Christopher was a little baby, I had gay readers and gay friends and knew gay people, and lived in the Castro district of San Francisco, which was a gay neighborhood."<ref name=NPR />

Rice's writings have also been identified as having had a major impact on later developments within the genre of [[Vampire literature|vampire fiction]].<ref name="Day 2002, p. 43"/> "Rice turns vampire conventions inside out," writes Susan Ferraro of ''The New York Times''. "Because Rice identifies with the vampire instead of the victim (reversing the usual focus), the horror for the reader springs from the realization of the monster within the self. Moreover, Rice's vampires are loquacious philosophers who spend much of eternity debating the nature of good and evil."<ref name="Ferraro"/>

In addition, Rice's writing style has been heavily analyzed.<ref name="Hunter" /> Ferraro, in a statement typical of many reviewers, describes her prose as "florid, both lurid and lyrical, and full of sensuous detail". However, others have criticized Rice's writing style as both verbose and overly philosophical.<ref name="Hunter"/> Author William Patrick Day comments that her writing is often "long, convoluted, and imprecise".<ref>Day 2002, p. 45</ref>

''[[The New York Times]]'' critic [[Michiko Kakutani]] wrote that "Anne Rice has what might best be described as a Gothic imagination crossed with a campy taste for the decadent and the bizarre."<ref name="Kakutani">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/19/books/books-of-the-times-vampire-for-out-times.html|title=Books of the Times; Vampire for Out Times|first=Michiko|last=Kakutani|author-link=Michiko Kakutani|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 19, 1985|access-date=May 20, 2020|page=16|url-access=limited|archive-date=October 15, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201015235431/https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/19/books/books-of-the-times-vampire-for-out-times.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Personal life==

===Back to New Orleans and Catholicism===
In June 1988, following the success of ''The Vampire Lestat'' and with ''The Queen of the Damned'' about to be published, the Rices purchased a second home in New Orleans, the Brevard-Rice House, built in 1857 for Albert Hamilton Brevard. Stan took a leave of absence from his teaching, and together they moved to New Orleans. Within months, they decided to make it their permanent home.<ref name="Ramsland312-317"/>

Rice returned to the Catholic Church in 1998 after decades of [[atheism]]. On December 14, 1998, she fell into a coma, later determined to be caused by [[diabetic ketoacidosis]] (DKA), and nearly died.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/DrJohnson/story?id=127735|work=ABC|title=Anne Rice Says Diabetes Nearly Killed Her|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date=June 26, 2004|access-date=January 21, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202011939/http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/DrJohnson/story?id=127735|archive-date=February 2, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> She was later diagnosed with [[Diabetes mellitus type 1]], and is now insulin-dependent.<ref>[http://www.annerice.com/msg020199.htm Anne Rice telephone message to fans about diabetic coma] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926220443/http://www.annerice.com/msg020199.htm |date=September 26, 2011 }} ''annerice.com,'' February 1, 1999.</ref><ref>Burke, Anne.

In October 2005, while promoting her book, ''[[Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt]]'', she announced in ''Newsweek'' that she would now use her life and talent of writing to glorify her belief in God, but did not renounce her earlier works.

In the Author's Note from ''Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt'', Rice states:

<blockquote>I had experienced an old-fashioned, strict Roman Catholic childhood in the 1940s and 1950s ... we attended daily Mass and Communion in an enormous and magnificently decorated church.... Stained-glass windows, the Latin Mass, the detailed answers to complex questions on good and evil—these things were imprinted on my soul forever....

I left this church at age 18.... I wanted to know what was happening, why so many seemingly good people didn't believe in any organized religion yet cared passionately about their behavior and value of their lives.... I broke with the church.... I wrote many novels that without my being aware that they reflected my quest for meaning in a world without God.<ref>Rice, Anne (2008). ''Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt: A Novel'' (trade paperback) New York: Ballantine Books. pp. 323–325. {{ISBN|978-0-345-49273-9}}.</ref></blockquote>

In her memoir ''Called Out of Darkness: A Spiritual Confession'', Rice also states:

<blockquote>In the moment of surrender, I let go of all the theological or social questions which had kept me from [God] for countless years. I simply let them go. There was the sense, profound and wordless, that if He knew everything I did not have to know everything, and that, in seeking to know everything, I'd been, all of my life, missing the entire point. No social paradox, no historic disaster, no hideous record of injustice or misery should keep me from Him. No question of Scriptural integrity, no torment over the fate of this or that atheist or gay friend, no worry for those condemned and ostracized by my church or any other church should stand between me and Him. The reason? It was magnificently simple: He knew how or why everything happened; He knew the disposition of every single soul. He wasn't going to let anything happen by accident! Nobody was going to go to Hell by mistake.<ref>Rice, Anne (2005). ''Called Out of Darkness: A Spiritual Confession''. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. p. 183. {{ISBN|978-0-307-26827-3}}.</ref></blockquote>

===Distancing from Christianity===
On July 28, 2010, Rice publicly announced her disdain for the current state of [[Christianity]] on her Facebook page, stating, "Today I quit being a Christian.... I remain committed to Christ as always but not to being 'Christian' or to being part of Christianity.

''Earth Angels'' was an NBC presentation pilot that wasn't picked up as a series. The pilot was filmed in Toronto in 2001.
