'''Hans Christian Andersen''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|n|d|ər|s|ən}}, {{IPA-da|ˈhænˀs ˈkʰʁestjæn ˈɑnɐsn̩|lang|Da-Hans_Christian_Andersen.ogg}}; 2 April 1805&nbsp;– 4 August 1875) was a Danish author. Although a prolific writer of plays, [[travelogue (literature)|travelogue]]s, novels, and poems, he is best remembered for his [[fairy tales]].

Andersen's fairy tales, consisting of 156 stories across nine volumes<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://andersen.sdu.dk/vaerk/register/eventyr_e.html|title=Hans Christian Andersen : Fairy tales|website=andersen.sdu.dk}}</ref> and translated into more than 125 languages,<ref name=cphpost>{{cite news|last=Wenande |first=Christian |title=Unknown Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale discovered |url=http://cphpost.dk/news/international/unknown-hans-christian-andersen-fairy-tale-discovered |access-date=15 December 2012 |newspaper=The Copenhagen Post |date=13 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121214223500/http://cphpost.dk/news/international/unknown-hans-christian-andersen-fairy-tale-discovered |archive-date=14 December 2012 }}</ref> have become culturally embedded in the West's [[collective consciousness]], readily accessible to children, but presenting lessons of virtue and resilience in the face of adversity for mature readers as well.<ref name="Wullschläger 2002">{{harvnb|Wullschläger|2002}}</ref> His most famous fairy tales include "[[The Emperor's New Clothes]]," "[[The Little Mermaid]]," "[[The Nightingale (fairy tale)|The Nightingale]]," "[[The Steadfast Tin Soldier]]", "[[The Red Shoes (fairy tale)|The Red Shoes]]", "[[The Princess and the Pea]]," "[[The Snow Queen]]," "[[The Ugly Duckling]]," "[[The Little Match Girl]]," and "[[Thumbelina]]."

==Early life==

{{Quote box |width=25em |quote="It doesn't matter about being born in a duckyard, as long as you are hatched from a swan's egg"|source="[[The Ugly Duckling]]"}}
Hans Christian Andersen was born in [[Odense]], Denmark on 2 April 1805. He had a stepsister named Karen.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://andersen.sdu.dk/liv/biografi/familie_e.html|website=SDU Hans Christian Andersen Centret|title=Life|access-date=June 10, 2021}}</ref> His father, also named Hans, considered himself related to nobility (his paternal grandmother had told his father that their family had belonged to a higher social class,<ref name="Rossel 1996 6">{{harvnb|Rossel|1996|p=6}}</ref> but investigations have disproved these stories).<ref name="Rossel 1996 6"/><ref>{{cite web |last=Askgaard |first=Ejnar Stig |title=The Lineage of Hans Christian Andersen |publisher=Odense City Museums |url=http://museum.odense.dk/knowledge/knowledge-hans-christian-andersen/publications-on-hca-/the-lineage-of-hca.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504132508/http://www.museum.odense.dk/knowledge/knowledge-hans-christian-andersen/publications-on-hca-/the-lineage-of-hca.aspx |archive-date=4 May 2012}}</ref> Although it has been challenged<ref name="Rossel 1996 6"/>, a persistent speculation suggests that Andersen was an illegitimate son of King [[Christian VIII of Denmark|Christian VIII]].  Danish historian Jens Jørgensen supported this idea in his book ''H.C. Andersen, en sand myte'' [a true myth]<ref>H.C. Andersen, en sand myte, Hovedland (January 1, 1987)</ref>.

Hans Christian Andersen was baptised on 15 April 1805 in [[Saint Hans Church]] (St John's Church) in [[Odense]], Denmark. His certificate of birth was not drafted until November 1823, according to which six Godparents were present at the baptising ceremony: Madam Sille Marie Breineberg, Maiden Friederiche Pommer, shoemaker Peder Waltersdorff, journeyman carpenter Anders Jørgensen, Hospital portner Nicolas Gomard, and Royal Hatter Jens Henrichsen Dorch.

Andersen's father, who had received an elementary school education, introduced his son to literature, reading to him the ''[[Arabian Nights]]''.<ref name=Rossel>{{harvnb|Rossel|1996|p=7}}</ref> Andersen's mother, Anne Marie Andersdatter, was an illiterate washerwoman. Following her husband's death in 1816, she remarried in 1818.<ref name=Rossel /> Andersen was sent to a local school for poor children where he received a basic education and had to support himself, working as an [[apprentice]] to a weaver and, later, to a tailor. At fourteen, he moved to [[Copenhagen]] to seek employment as an actor. Having an excellent soprano voice, he was accepted into the [[Royal Danish Theatre]], but his voice soon changed. A colleague at the theatre told him that he considered Andersen a poet. Taking the suggestion seriously, Andersen began to focus on writing.

[[File:H.C. Andersens Barndomshjemmet2.JPG|thumb|left|Andersen's childhood home in Odense]]
[[Jonas Collin]], director of the Royal Danish Theatre, held great affection for Andersen and sent him to a [[grammar school]] in [[Slagelse]], persuading [[Frederick VI of Denmark|King Frederick VI]] to pay part of the youth's education.<ref>[http://www.danishnet.com/info.php/cultural/hans-christian-andersen-281.html Hans Christian Andersen - Childhood and Education]. Danishnet.</ref> Andersen had by then published his first story, "The Ghost at Palnatoke's Grave" (1822). Though not a stellar pupil, he also attended school at [[Helsingør|Elsinore]] until 1827.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hcandersen-homepage.dk/?page_id=3257 |title=H.C. Andersens skolegang i Helsingør Latinskole |publisher=Hcandersen-homepage.dk |access-date=2 April 2010}}</ref>

He later said that his years at this school were the darkest and most bitter years of his life. At one particular school, he lived at his schoolmaster's home. There he was abused and was told that it was done in order "to improve his character". He later said that the dogs had discouraged him from writing, which then resulted in a depression.{{sfn|Wullschläger|2002|p=56}}

==Career==
[[File:Hans Christian Andersen - The Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep - silhouette.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Paper chimney sweep [[Scherenschnitte|cut]] by Andersen]]

===Early work===
A very early fairy tale by Andersen, "[[The Tallow Candle]]" ({{lang-da|Tællelyset}}), was discovered in a Danish archive in October 2012. The story, written in the 1820s, is about a candle that did not feel appreciated. It was written while Andersen was still in school and dedicated to one of his benefactors. The story remained in that family's possession until it turned up among other family papers in a local archive.<ref>{{cite web|title=Local historian finds Hans Christian Andersen's first fairy tale|url=http://politiken.dk/newsinenglish/ECE1841147/local-historian-finds-hans-christian-andersens-first-fairy-tale/|publisher=Politiken.dk|access-date=2 June 2013}}</ref>

In 1829, Andersen enjoyed considerable success with the short story "A Journey on Foot from Holmen's Canal to the East Point of Amager." Its protagonist meets characters ranging from [[Saint Peter]] to a talking cat. Andersen followed this success with a theatrical piece, ''Love on St. Nicholas Church Tower'', and a short volume of poems. He made little progress in writing and publishing immediately following the issue of these poems but he did receive a small travel grant from the king in 1833. This enabled him to set out on the first of many journeys throughout Europe. At [[Canton of Jura|Jura]], near [[Le Locle]], Switzerland, Andersen wrote the story "Agnete and the Merman". The same year he spent an evening in the Italian seaside village of [[Sestri Levante]], the place which inspired the title of "The Bay of Fables".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://andersenfestival.it |title=Andersen Festival, Sestri Levante|publisher=Andersen Festival|access-date=2 June 2013}}</ref> He arrived in [[Rome]] in October 1834. Andersen's travels in Italy were reflected in his first novel, a fictionalized autobiography titled ''[[The Improvisatore]]'' ({{lang|da|Improvisatoren}}), published in 1835 to instant acclaim.<ref name="Murray2013">{{cite book|author=Christopher John Murray|title=Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era, 1760-1850|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8GS8DWMLRYEC&pg=PA20|date=13 May 2013|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=978-1-135-45579-8|page=20}}</ref><ref name="Sjåvik2006">{{cite book|author=Jan Sjåvik|title=Historical Dictionary of Scandinavian Literature and Theater|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tCBpiKsi7a0C&pg=RA1-PA8|date=19 April 2006|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-6501-3|page=20}}</ref>

===Fairy Tales===
'''''Fairy Tales Told for Children. First Collection.''''' ([[Danish language|Danish]]: ''Eventyr, fortalt for Børn. Første Samling.'') is a collection of nine [[fairy tales]] by Hans Christian Andersen. The tales were published in a series of three installments by C. A. Reitzel in [[Copenhagen, Denmark]] between May 1835 and April 1837, and represent Andersen's first venture into the fairy tale genre.

The first installment of sixty-one unbound pages was published 8 May 1835 and contained "[[The Tinderbox]]", "[[Little Claus and Big Claus]]", "[[The Princess and the Pea]]" and "Little Ida's Flowers". The first three tales were based on folktales Andersen had heard in his childhood while the last tale was completely Andersen's creation and created for Ida Thiele, the daughter of Andersen's early benefactor, the folklorist [[Just Mathias Thiele]]. Reitzel paid Andersen thirty rixdollars for the manuscript, and the booklet was priced at twenty-four shillings.<ref name="WullschlagerP150">{{Harvnb|Wullschläger|2002|p=150}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Frank|2005|p=13}}</ref>

The second booklet was published on 16 December 1835 and contained "[[Thumbelina]]", "The Naughty Boy" and "The Traveling Companion". "Thumbelina" was completely Andersen's creation although inspired by "[[Tom Thumb]]" and other stories of miniature people. "The Naughty Boy" was based on a poem by [[Anacreon]] about [[Cupid]], and "The Traveling Companion" was a ghost story Andersen had experimented with in the year 1830.<ref name="WullschlagerP150" />

The third booklet contained "[[The Little Mermaid]]" and "[[The Emperor's New Clothes]]", and it was published on 7 April 1837. "The Little Mermaid" was completely Andersen's creation though influenced by [[Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué|De la Motte Fouqué]]'s "Undine" (1811) and the lore about mermaids. This tale established Andersen's international reputation.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wullschläger|2002|p=174}}</ref> The only other tale in the third booklet was "The Emperor's New Clothes", which was based on a medieval Spanish story with Arab and Jewish sources. On the eve of the third installment's publication, Andersen revised the conclusion of his story, (the Emperor simply walks in procession) to its now-familiar finale of a child calling out, "The Emperor is not wearing any clothes!"<ref>{{Harvnb|Wullschläger|2002|p=176}}</ref>

Danish reviews of the first two booklets first appeared in 1836 and were not enthusiastic. The critics disliked the chatty, informal style and immorality that flew in the face of their expectations. Children's literature was meant to educate rather than to amuse. The critics discouraged Andersen from pursuing this type of style. Andersen believed that he was working against the critics' preconceived notions about fairy tales, and he temporarily returned to novel-writing. The critics' reaction was so severe that Andersen waited a full year before publishing his third installment.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wullschläger|2002|pp=150,165}}</ref>

The nine tales from the three booklets were combined and then published in one volume and sold at seventy-two shillings. A title page, a table of contents, and a preface by Andersen were published in this volume.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wullschläger|2002|p=178}}</ref>

In 1868 [[Horace Scudder]], the editor of ''[[Riverside Magazine For Young People]]'', offered Andersen $500 for a dozen new stories. Sixteen of Andersen’s stories were published in the American magazine, and ten of them appeared there before they were printed in Denmark.<ref>Rossel, Sven Hakon, ''Hans Christian Anderson, Writer and Citizen of the World'', Rodopi, 1996</ref>

===Travelogues===
In 1851 he published ''In Sweden'', a volume of travel sketches. The publication received wide acclaim. A keen traveler, Andersen published several other long [[travel literature|travelogues]]: ''Shadow Pictures of a Journey to the Harz, Swiss Saxony, etc. etc. in the Summer of 1831'', ''A Poet's Bazaar'', ''In Spain'' and ''A Visit to Portugal in 1866''. (The last describes his visit with his [[Portugal|Portuguese]] friends Jorge and José O'Neill, who were his friends in the mid-1820s while he was living in Copenhagen.) In his travelogues, Andersen took heed of some of the contemporary conventions related to travel writing but he always developed the style to suit his own purpose. Each of his travelogues combines documentary and descriptive accounts of his experiences, adding additional philosophical passages on topics such as what it is to be an author, general immortality, and the nature of fiction in literary travel reports. Some of the travelogues, such as ''In Sweden'', even contain fairy-tales.

In the 1840s, Andersen's attention again returned to the theatre stage, but with little success. He had better luck with the publication of the ''Picture-Book without Pictures'' (1840). A second series of fairy tales was started in 1838 and a third series in 1845. Andersen was now celebrated throughout Europe although his native Denmark still showed some resistance to his pretensions.

Between 1845 and 1864, H. C. Andersen lived at [[Nyhavn 67]], Copenhagen, where a memorial plaque is placed on a building.<ref name="Official Tourism Site of Copenhagen">{{cite web |url=http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/content/press/press_information/hans_christian_andersen/in_the_footsteps_of_andersen |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725103354/http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/content/press/press_information/hans_christian_andersen/in_the_footsteps_of_andersen |url-status=dead |archive-date=25 July 2008 |title=Official Tourism Site of Copenhagen |publisher=Visitcopenhagen.com |access-date=2 April 2010 }}</ref>

The works of Hans Andersen became known throughout the world. Rising from a poor social class, the works made him into an acclaimed author. Royal families of the world were patrons of the writings including the monarchy of Denmark, the [[House of Glücksburg|House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg]]. An unexpected invitation from [[Christian IX of Denmark|King Christian IX]] to the royal palace would not only entrench the Andersen folklore in Danish royalty but would [[The Snow Queen (1957 film)#Context and history|inexplicably be transmitted to the Romanov dynasty in Russia]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Кудряшов|first=Константин|date=25 November 2017|title=Дагмар — принцесса на русской горошине.

==Personal life==

===Søren Kierkegaard===
In ‘Andersen as a Novelist’, [[Søren Kierkegaard]] remarks that Andersen is characterized as, “...a possibility of a personality, wrapped up in such a web of arbitrary moods and moving through an elegiac duo-decimal scale [i.e., a [[chromatic scale]]. Proceeding by semitones, and therefore including sharps as well as flats, such a scale is associated more with lament or elegy than is an ordinary [[diatonic scale]]] of almost echoless, dying tones just as easily roused as subdued, who, in order to become a personality, needs a strong life-development.”

===Meetings with Charles Dickens===
In June 1847, Andersen paid his first visit to England and he enjoyed a triumphal social success during this summer. The [[Marguerite Gardiner, Countess of Blessington|Countess of Blessington]] invited him to her parties where intellectual people would meet, and it was at one of such parties where he met [[Charles Dickens]] for the first time. They shook hands and walked to the veranda, which Andersen wrote about in his diary: "We were on the veranda, and I was so happy to see and speak to England's now-living writer whom I do love the most."<ref name="dickens">{{cite web|url=http://www.hcandersen-homepage.dk/?page_id=3704 |title=H.C. Andersen og Charles Dickens 1857 |publisher=Hcandersen-homepage.dk |access-date=16 January 2015}}</ref>

The two authors respected each other's work and as writers, they shared something important in common: depictions of the poor and the underclass who often had difficult lives affected both by the [[Industrial Revolution]] and by abject poverty. In the [[Victorian era]] there was a growing sympathy for children and an idealization of the innocence of childhood.

Ten years later, Andersen visited England again, primarily to meet Dickens. He extended the planned brief visit to Dickens' home at [[Gads Hill Place]] into a five-week stay, much to the distress of Dickens' family. After Andersen was told to leave, Dickens gradually stopped all correspondence between them, this to the great disappointment and confusion of Andersen, who had quite enjoyed the visit and could never understand why his letters went unanswered.<ref name="dickens"/>

There is a sharp division in opinion over Andersen's physical fulfillment in the sexual sphere. The Hans Christian Andersen Center of [[University of Southern Denmark]] and biographer Jackie Wullschlager hold contradictory views.<ref>http://hcandersen.org/en/research-and-knowledge/</ref>

Wullschlager’s biography maintains he was possibly lovers with Danish dancer [[Harald Scharff]]<ref name="Scharff">{{cite web|url=http://www.andersen.sdu.dk/liv/tidstavle/vis_e.html?date=1862-00-00 |title=The Life of Hans Christian Andersen.

In contrast to Wullschlager's assertions are Klara Bom and Anya Aarenstrup from the H. C. Andersen Centre of [[University of Southern Denmark]]. They state "it is correct to point to the very ambivalent (and also very traumatic) elements in Andersen's emotional life concerning the sexual sphere, but it is decidedly just as wrong to describe him as homosexual and maintain that he had physical relationships with men. He did not. Indeed, that would have been entirely contrary to his moral and religious ideas, aspects that are quite outside the field of vision of Wullschlager and her like."<ref>Hans Christian Andersen Center, [http://www.andersen.sdu.dk/rundtom/faq/index_e.html?emne=homo Hans Christian Andersen – FAQ]</ref>

Andersen also fell in love with unattainable women, and many of his stories are interpreted as references.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hastings|first=Waller|title=Hans Christian Andersen|url=http://www.northern.edu/hastingw/hcandersen.htm|publisher=Northern State University|access-date=15 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123053333/http://www.northern.edu/hastingw/hcandersen.htm|archive-date=23 November 2007|date=4 April 2003}}</ref> At one point, he wrote in his diary: "Almighty God, thee only have I; thou steerest my fate, I must give myself up to thee!

A small pouch containing a long letter from Voigt was found on Andersen's chest when he died several decades after he first fell in love with her, and after, he presumably fell in love with others. Other disappointments in love included Sophie Ørsted, the daughter of the physicist [[Hans Christian Ørsted]], and Louise Collin, the youngest daughter of his benefactor Jonas Collin. One of his stories, "[[The Nightingale (fairy tale)|The Nightingale]]", was written as an expression of his passion for [[Jenny Lind]] and became the inspiration for her nickname, the "Swedish Nightingale".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://altomhistorie.dk/artikler/h-c-andersen-og-jenny-lind/|title=H.C. Andersen og Jenny Lind|date=2 July 2014}}</ref> Andersen was often shy around women and had extreme difficulty in proposing to Lind. When Lind was boarding a train to go to an opera concert, Andersen gave Lind a letter of proposal. Her feelings towards him were not the same; she saw him as a brother, writing to him in 1844: "farewell&nbsp;... God bless and protect my brother is the sincere wish of his affectionate sister, Jenny".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hcandersen-homepage.dk/?page_id=22484 |title=H.C.

[[File:Hans Christian Andersen Grave.jpg|thumb|upright|Andersen's refreshed gravestone at [[Assistens Cemetery (Copenhagen)|Assistens Cemetery]] in the [[Nørrebro]] district of Copenhagen.]]
In early 1872, at age 67, Andersen fell out of his bed and was severely hurt; he never fully recovered from the resultant injuries. Soon afterward, he started to show signs of liver cancer.<ref name="Bryant">Bryant, Mark: ''Private Lives'', 2001, p. 12.</ref>

He died on 4 August 1875, in a house called ''[[Rolighed (Østerbro)|Rolighed]]'' (literally: calmness), near Copenhagen, the home of his close friends, the banker Moritz Melchior and his wife.<ref name="Bryant"/> Shortly before his death, Andersen had consulted a composer about the music for his funeral, saying: "Most of the people who will walk after me will be children, so make the beat keep time with little steps."<ref name="Bryant"/>

His body was interred in the [[Assistens Cemetery (Copenhagen)|Assistens Kirkegård]] in the [[Nørrebro]] area of [[Copenhagen]], in the family plot of the Collins. However, in 1914 the stone was moved to another cemetery (today known as ''"Frederiksbergs ældre kirkegaard"''), where younger Collin family members were buried. For a period, his, Edvard Collin's and Henriette Collin's graves were unmarked. A second stone has been erected, marking H.C. Andersen's grave, now without any mention of the Collin couple, but all three still share the same plot.<ref>in Danish, http://www.hcandersen-homepage.dk/?page_id=6226</ref>

At the time of his death, Andersen was internationally revered, and the Danish Government paid him an annual stipend as a "national treasure".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/writer/hans-christian-andersen|title=Hans Christian Andersen|website=Biography}}</ref>
