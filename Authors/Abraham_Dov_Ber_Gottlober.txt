'''Avrom Ber Gotlober''' ({{Lang-yi|אברהם־בּער גאָטלאָבּער}}; January 14, 1811, [[Starokostiantyniv|Starokonstantinov]], [[Volhynian Governorate|Volhynia]] – April 12, 1899, [[Białystok]]), also known by the [[pen name]]s '''Abag''' ({{Lang-he|אב״ג}}) and '''Mahalalel''' ({{Lang-he|מַהֲלַלְאֵל}}), was a [[Russian Empire|Russian]] [[Haskalah|Maskilic]] writer, poet, playwright, historian, journalist and educator. His first collection was published in 1835.

== Biography ==
Avrom Ber Gotlober was born to a [[Jews|Jewish]] family in [[Starokostiantyniv|Starokonstantinov]], where he received a traditional [[Jewish education]]. His father was a ''[[hazzan|ḥazzan]]'' who sympathized with the [[Reform Judaism|progressive movement]]. At the age of fourteen Gotlober married the daughter of a wealthy [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasid]] in [[Chernihiv|Chernigov]], and settled there. When his inclination for secular knowledge became known, his father-in-law, on the advice of a Hasidic rabbi, caused the young couple to be divorced. After a failed second marriage, in 1830, he married for the third time and settled in [[Kremenets|Kremenetz]], where he formed a lasting acquaintance with [[Isaac Baer Levinsohn]].

Gotlober traveled and taught from 1836 to 1851, when he went to [[Zhytomyr|Zhitomir]] and passed the teachers' examinations at the rabbinical school. After teaching for three years at a government school for Jewish boys in [[Kamianets-Podilskyi|Kamenetz-Podolsk]], he was transferred to a similar position in his native city, where he remained for about eleven years. Among Gotlober's students were [[Mendele Mocher Sforim]], [[Sholom Aleichem]], and [[Abraham Goldfaden]].{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

In 1865 he became a teacher in the rabbinical school in Zhitomir, and remained there until it was closed by the government in 1873. He then settled in [[Dubno]] with his son-in-law, who was the official rabbi of that town. Thence he removed to [[Kaunas|Kovno]], and subsequently to [[Białystok]], where the aged poet, who in later years had become blind, ended his days in poverty and neglect.

==Work==
Gottlober was a prolific writer and one of the foremost of [[modern Hebrew]] poets. The first collection of his poems, which was entitled ''Pirḥe ha-Aviv'', appeared in ''Yozefov'' in 1836. A second collection, entitled ''Ha-Nitzanim'' (Vilna, 1850), was followed by ''Anaf Etz Avot,'' three poems, on the death of [[Nicholas I of Russia]], on the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|peace of 1856]], and on the [[Coronation of the Russian monarch|coronation]] of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], respectively (Vilna, 1858). Soon afterward he visited Austria, where he published ''Shir ha-Shirim'', a translation of a Passover sermon delivered by [[Adolf Jellinek]] (Lemberg, 1861), and ''Mi-Mitzrayim'', a translation of [[Ludwig August von Frankl]]'s account of his travels in the [[Middle East]], with an appendix by [[Max Letteris]] (Vienna, 1862).

Gottlober's next important work was the ''Bikoret le-Toledot ha-Kara'im'', a critical investigation of the history of the [[Karaite Judaism|Karaites]], with notes by [[Abraham Firkovich]] (Vilna, 1865). In the same year were published his ''Yerushalayim'', a translation of [[Moses Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]'s ''[[Jerusalem (Mendelssohn)|Jerusalem]]'', with an introduction, and his allegorical drama ''Tif'eret li-Bene Binah'' (Zhitomir, 1867), modeled after [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]]'s ''La-Yesharim Tehillah''. 

His ''Iggeret Tza'ar Ba'ale Ḥayyim'' (Zhitomir, 1868) is a polemic against {{ill|Abraham Uri Kovner|he|אברהם אורי קובנר}}'s critical work "Ḥeker Dabar." Gottlober's ''Toledot ha-Kabbalah veha-Ḥasidut'' (Zhitomir, 1869), which purports to be a history of [[Kabbalah]] and of Hasidism, is only a diatribe against Kabbalah in which the history of Ḥasidism is scarcely mentioned. He also wrote several short Hebrew novels, and translated [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]'s ''[[Nathan the Wise]]'', to which he added a biography of the author (Vienna, 1874).

Gottlober was the founder and editor of the Hebrew monthly ''Ha-Boker Or'', to which some of the best contemporary writers contributed poems, articles, and stories. It had an interrupted existence of about seven years, first appearing in [[Lviv|Lemberg]] (1876-1879) and then in [[Warsaw]] (1880–81), in which place also the last five numbers were issued in 1885–86. His most important contribution to this magazine was undoubtedly his [[autobiography]] ''Zikronot mi-Yeme Ne'urai'', containing much material for the culture-history of the Jews of Russia, which was reprinted in book form at Warsaw, 1880–81. The last collection of his poems is entitled ''Kol Shire Mahalalel'', 3 vols., Warsaw, 1890.
