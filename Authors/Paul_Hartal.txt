'''Paul Hartal''' (born 1936) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] painter and poet, born in [[Szeged]], [[Hungary]].  He has created the term "Lyrical Conceptualism" to characterize his style in both painting and poetry.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.poeticmind.co.uk/interviews-1/portals-of-the-mind-and-the-soul/ |title=Interview with Paul (paragraph 20) |access-date=2012-03-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327043513/http://www.poeticmind.co.uk/interviews-1/portals-of-the-mind-and-the-soul/ |archive-date=2012-03-27 |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Biographical information ==

Hartal emigrated to [[Israel]] in 1957 and on to [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] in 1973.  He earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] in 1964, an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] from [[Concordia University (Quebec)|Concordia University]] in 1977, and a [[Ph.D.]] in Education and Art from [[Columbia Pacific University]], San Rafael, California in 1986.  In 1987 Hartal founded the Centre for Art, Science, and Technology in Montreal, which he directs.

Hartal paints in an [[Expressionism|expressionistic]] style with additional elements such as photographs.

:"Lyrical Conceptualism does not impose any formal limitations on the artist's freedom. It merely suggests. Instead of competition it advocates cooperation. In our post-industrial society, science and technology determine our lifestyle. Consequently, art must concern itself with science and technology. However, science and technology should not be our masters but our servants" (1975).

Hartal exhibited his paintings internationally, including galleries and museums in Paris, New York, Seoul, Budapest and Montreal. In 1978 he showed his work at the Musee du Luxembourg in the French capital and his painting, Flowers for Cezanne won the Prix de Paris. As a writer, Hartal has authored books of poetry, nonfiction, as well as the illustrated novel, ''The Kidnapping of the Painter Miro'', which has also been published in Mandarin Chinese translation ({{ISBN|978-957-05-2977-7}}).

== Lyco art: Hartal's art theory ==

''Lyco art'', or ''lyrical conceptualism'', is a term coined by Hartal.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.federationofpoets.com/featurepaulhartal.htm |title=Canadian Federation of Poets: Featured poet - Paul Hartal |access-date=2006-11-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215611/http://www.federationofpoets.com/featurepaulhartal.htm |archive-date=2016-03-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 1975, Hartal published ''A Manifesto on Lyrical Conceptualism'',<ref>Hartal, Paul. ''The Brush and the Compass: The Interface Dynamics of Art and Science''. Lanham, MD: University Press of America, 1988, p. V.</ref><ref>Exler, Elizabeth. “Paul Hartal: A Manifesto on Lyrical Conceptualism.” ''Manhattan Arts''. November–December 1992, p. 14.</ref> introducing Lycoism as a new art idea on the "periodic table of art." In this work, Hartal proposes a [[theory]] of [[art]] which runs contrary to what he claims is the traditional belief, that [[Lateralization of brain function|emotion and intellect are at odds with each other]].

In ''Mazes for the Mind'', Clifford Pickover draws attention to Hartal's view that we need the [[imagination]], the [[insight]], and the [[Reason|lateral reasoning faculty]], as well as human [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], which are excluded from the rigid [[scientific method|methodology of science]] but are intrinsic to art: "The present human condition calls for the rise of a new, inclusive form of [[culture]] in which art should play a most prominent role."<ref>[[Clifford A. Pickover]] (1992). ''Mazes for the Mind''. New York: St. Martin's Press. pp. 277-79.</ref>

The [[art critic]] Balint Szombathy notes that lyrical conceptualism encapsulates no less a fusion of polarities than the term-amalgams of lyrical expressionism, or [[lyrical abstraction]]. It is possible to characterize these diametrically opposed [[Juxtaposition (literary)|juxtaposition]]s, he says, as attempts to equalize incompatible elements for the sake of synthesis.

However, in introducing the notion of Lycoism, Hartal did not intend to form a new post-conceptualist splinter-trend; instead, his intention was the creation of a new [[philosophy of art]] in which the tearing down of the boundaries between art and science, the interlacement of the intuitive and the exact, and incorporation of the lyrical and the geometrical play a central role.<ref>Szombathy, Balint. "A lirai konceptualizmus muveszete: Paul Hartal elmeleti-gyakorlati torekvesei." ''Uj Forras''. April 1991, No. 4.</ref>

==Concepts and ideals of Lyco art==
Lyco art identifies the meaning of art with its life-serving purpose. Concerning itself with cultural transformation and the [[human condition]], it seeks to expand the boundaries of [[aesthetics]].<ref>Hartal, Paul. "The songs of the double helix: symmetry and lyrical conceptualism." ''Symmetry 2000 Part 2''. ed. Hargittai, I. and T.C. Laurent. London: Portland Press, 2002, pp. 503-518.</ref>

Lyco art creates a conscious bridge between the impulsive, intuitional, and planned elements of the creative process,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.poeticmind.co.uk/2_Questions/Interview_Paul_Hartal.shtm |title=Interview with Paul Hartal (Poetic Mind, 2008, paragraph 20.) |access-date=2008-07-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207071353/http://www.poeticmind.co.uk/2_Questions/Interview_Paul_Hartal.shtm |archive-date=2008-12-07 |url-status=live }}</ref> thereby moving along the whole continuum of formative energies. This creative process represents the interaction of emotion and intellect, wherein the passion of logic and the logic of passion are inexorably interwoven through the voyage of aesthetic [[consciousness]].

In applying theory to practice in [[design]] and [[painting]], Lycoism finds its expression in coded [[color]]s and [[form (visual art)|form]]s. Accordingly, warm [[hue]]s and amorphous [[shapes]] might correspond to emotion and the irrational, while [[Color theory|cold colors]] and [[List of geometric shapes|geometric forms]] might express the rational and the logical.

In addition, since [[science]] and [[technology]] impact so much of modern lifestyle during [[Information Age|the electronic age]], Lycoism views the relationship of art, science, and technology as a pivotal concern. Lycoism refuses to polarize science and art; instead, it seeks to unify [[aesthetics]] and [[ethics]] in works which involve the use of science and technology by the artist in the creation of beauty.

In accordance with these premises, Hartal formed The Centre for Art, Science and Technology in Montreal during the 1980s. The Centre has implemented a variety of interdisciplinary projects exploring the connections between several branches of arts and sciences, including [[painting]], [[poetry]], [[music]], [[architecture]], [[communication]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[mathematics]], [[cosmology]], and [[space exploration]].<ref>Costa, Barbara. "Dell' 'aeropittura' futurista alla 'Space Art'." ''Epiphaneia/2''. Universita degli studi di Salerno, March 1997, pp. 38-42.</ref><ref>Hartal, Paul. "Homage to a Blue Planet: Aeronautical and Astronomical Artworks."

V.25.2, 1992, pp. 211–215.</ref>
