'''Mimi Khalvati''' (born 28 April 1944) is an Iranian-born [[United Kingdom|British]] poet.

==Life and career==
She was born in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]] on 28 April 1944.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://literature.britishcouncil.org/writer/mimi-khalvati|title=British Council Writers Directory|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> She grew up on the [[Isle of Wight]] and was educated in [[Switzerland]] at the [[University of Neuchâtel]], and in [[London]] at the [[Drama Centre]] and the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]].

She then worked as a theatre director in Tehran, translating from English into [[Persian language|Persian]] and devising new plays, as well as co-founding the Theatre in Exile group.

She now lives in [[London Borough of Hackney]], and is a Visiting Lecturer at [[Goldsmiths College]] and a director of the London Poetry School.

Khalvati was 47 when her first book was published in 1991.<ref>Schmidt, Michael: ''Lives of the Poets'', p. 858. Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2007.</ref> Its title, ''In White Ink'', derives from the work of [[Hélène Cixous]] who claimed that women in the past have written "in white ink". Michael Schmidt observes that Khalvati is "formally a most resourceful poet".<ref>Schmidt, Michael: ''Lives of the Poets'', p. 859.</ref>

Khalvati is the founder of The Poetry School, running poetry workshops and courses in London, and is co-editor of the school's first two anthologies of new writing: ''Tying the Song'' and ''Entering The Tapestry''. She is also tutor at the [[Arvon Foundation]], and has taught creative writing at universities and colleges in the [[United States]] of America and Britain.

==Quotes==
* "There is some poetry in the universe, in the world we live in. What poets do is to first be alive to it, and awake and receptive to it, and in love with it – I think it has a lot to do with love – and then have the wherewithal to translate that poetry that’s out there into poems, so, for me it’s an act of listening and of translating into heard and written language."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ditsomokos.com/2016/08/03/the-weather-wheel-an-interview-with-mimi-khalvati/|title="The Weather Wheel": An interview with Mimi Khalvati|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>
