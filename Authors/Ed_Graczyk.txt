The legend of the late actor [[James Dean]], and the closure of [[Variety store#North America|five-and-dime]] stores in this place, lent their influences to the play's development.<ref name=review-mag/>  Graczyk went on to say:

{{cquote|''Jimmy Dean'' can only be described as the result of my own observations and frustrations with progress that ignores a past; the lack of personalization and pride and the recurring need of people to build facades to conceal the truths of their lives. It is the facade that makes abnormal people seem normal and the sad people seem happy. A personal observation which I feel makes the people I write about, colorful, theatrical, but most of all, honest.<ref name=slu>{{Cite web|url=http://www.slu.edu/theatre/jimmyplaywright.html|title=''Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean'': The Playwright|accessdate=2010-05-15|publisher=[[Saint Louis University]] (slu.edu)}}</ref>}}
