===Yuvak Hindi Journal===
''Yuvak'', an illustrated Hindi monthly magazine, was launched in January 1929 by Rambriksh Benipuri, a distinguished Hindi writer, critic, poet, journalist and freedom fighter.<ref name="Srivastava 2015"/> He was assisted by [[Ganga Sharan Singh (Sinha)]], Ambica Kant Sinha and Jagdish Narayan in its publication.<ref name="Srivastava 2015"/> Devoted to 'strength, courage and culture', Yuvak was edited, printed and published by Rambriksh Benipuri from the Patna Yuvak Ashram.<ref name="Srivastava 2015"/> It was printed at the Searchlight Press.<ref name="Srivastava 2015"/> Yuvak was the official organ of the ''Patna Yuvak Sangh'' founded in 1927 by Manindra Narayan Roy, a journalist of ''The Searchlight''.<ref name="Srivastava 2015"/>

''Yuvak'' made Benipuri an eyesore of the colonial British government as its mission was to secure Swaraj for India promoting armed revolution and overthrowing the British regime.<ref name="Srivastava 2015"/> Its writings had a clear impact of Marxism as its contributors were political elites, avowed nationalists and Marxist revolutionaries.<ref name="Srivastava 2015"/>

===As a Playwright===
Ramvriksha Benipuri stands in a class apart as a playwright.<ref name="Datta 1976">{{cite book

 | publisher = Kashi Prasad Jayaswal Research Institute, Patna
 | edition = 1976

===Short stories===
In most of Ramvriksha Benipuri's short stories pictures of rural life of north Bihar, specially that of Muzaffarpur district have been vividly presented.<ref name="Datta 1976"/> His ''Mati ki Mooraten'', though not a story book in strict sense of the term, actually presents persons of flesh and blood, each throbbing with life, on a rural canvas.<ref name="Datta 1976"/>

===Style and influence===
Benipuri wrote mostly big stories and essays. His dramas covered mostly ancient events. For example, ''Amipure'' depicts the life of the famous courtesan [[Ambapali|Ambipure]] who adopted and converted to [[Buddhism]] after meeting [[Gautam Buddha|Buddha]]. Likewise ''Netradaan'' (that is, Gift of Eyes), another drama, is based on a historical legend involving [[Ashoka]] and his son Kunal.

He was also a distinguished playwright.<ref name="Rai 1995"/>

A stanza from one of his famous poems, ''"Shahido – tumhari yaad me"'' goes like this:
{{quote|"Hey, the Martyrs of August Revolution,

We shall forever keep the flag high

For which thy hath given the lives;

We shall always esteem the path of martyrdom

Sanctified by the blood of the supreme sacrifice."|}}<ref>{{cite book

{{quote|''When I recall Non-Cooperation era of 1921, the image of a storm confronts my eyes. From the time I became aware, I have witnessed numerous movements, however, I can assert that no other movement upturned the foundations of Indian society to the extent that the Non-Cooperation movement did. from the most humble huts to the high places, from villages to cities, everywhere there was a ferment, a loud echo.''|}}
