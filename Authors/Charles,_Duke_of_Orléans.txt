'''Charles of Orléans''' (24 November 1394 – 5 January 1465) was [[Duke of Orléans]] from 1407, following the murder of his father, [[Louis I, Duke of Orléans]]. He was also [[Duke of Valois]], Count of [[Beaumont-sur-Oise]] and of [[Blois]], [[Lord of Coucy]], and the inheritor of [[Asti]] in Italy via his mother [[Valentina Visconti, Duchess of Orléans|Valentina Visconti]].

He is now remembered as an accomplished [[Medieval French literature|medieval poet]], owing to the more than five hundred extant poems he produced, written in both French and English, during his 25 years spent as a prisoner of war and after his return to France.

== Accession ==
Charles was born in Paris, the son of [[Louis I, Duke of Orléans]] and Valentina Visconti, daughter of [[Gian Galeazzo Visconti]], [[Duke of Milan]].{{sfn|Goodrich|1967|p=11}}  He acceded to the [[duchy]] at the age of thirteen after his father had been [[Assassination of Louis I, Duke of Orléans|assassinated]] on the orders of [[John the Fearless|John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy]].{{sfn|Vaughan|2002|p=44–46}} Charles was expected to carry on his father's leadership against the [[Burgundian (party)|Burgundian]]s, a French faction which supported the [[Duke of Burgundy]]. The latter was never punished for his role in Louis' assassination, and Charles had to watch as his grief-stricken mother Valentina Visconti succumbed to illness not long afterwards. At her deathbed, Charles and the other boys of the family were made to swear the traditional oath of vengeance for their father's murder.

During the early years of his reign as duke, the orphaned Charles was heavily influenced by the guidance of his father-in-law, [[Bernard VII, Count of Armagnac]], for which reason Charles' faction came to be known as the [[Armagnac (party)|Armagnac]]s.

== Imprisonment ==
After war with the [[Kingdom of England]] was renewed in 1415, Charles was one of the many French noblemen at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] on 25 October 1415. He was discovered unwounded but trapped under a pile of corpses. He was taken prisoner by the English, and spent the next twenty-four years as their hostage.  After his capture, his entire library was moved by [[Yolande of Aragon]] to [[Saumur]], to prevent it from falling into enemy hands.

He was held at various locations, moved from one castle to another in England, including the [[Tower of London]], and [[Pontefract Castle]] – the castle where England's young King [[Richard II]], cousin once removed of the then incumbent English King [[Henry V of England|Henry V]], had been imprisoned and died 15 years earlier at the age of 33.

The conditions of his confinement were not strict; he was allowed to live more or less in the manner to which he had become accustomed, like so many other captured nobles. However, he was not offered release in exchange for a ransom, since the English King Henry V had left instructions forbidding any release: Charles was the natural head of the Armagnac faction and in the line of succession to the French throne, and was therefore deemed too important to be returned to circulation.

== Poetry ==
It was during these twenty-four years that Charles would write most of his poetry, including melancholy works which seem to be commenting on the captivity itself, such as ''En la forêt de longue attente''. 

The majority of his output consists of two books, one in French and the other in English, in the ''ballade'' and ''rondeau'' fixed forms. Though once controversial, it is now abundantly clear that Charles wrote the English poems which he left behind when he was released in 1440.{{sfn|Fox|1965|p=433-462}} Unfortunately, his acceptance in the English canon has been slow. [[Anne Coldiron|A. E. B. Coldiron]] has argued that the problem relates to his "approach to the erotic, his use of puns, wordplay, and rhetorical devices, his formal complexity and experimentation, his stance or voice: all these place him well outside the fifteenth-century literary milieu in which he found himself in England.{{sfn|Coldiron|2000|p=11}}

One of his poems, ''[[Is she not passing fair?]]'', was translated by [[Louisa Stuart Costello]] and set to music by [[Edward Elgar]]. [[Claude Debussy]] set three of his poems to music in his ''[[Trois Chansons (Debussy)|Trois Chansons de Charles d'Orléans]]'', [[List of compositions by Claude Debussy by Lesure numbers|L.92]], for unaccompanied mixed choir.  [[Reynaldo Hahn]] set six of them : ''Les Fourriers d'été, Comment se peut-il faire ainsi, Un loyal cœur (Chansons et Madrigaux - 1907) ; Quand je fus pris au pavillon, Je me mets en votre mercy, Gardez le trait de la fenêtre (Rondels - 1899).''

== Freedom ==
Finally freed in 1440 by the efforts of his former enemies, [[Philip the Good]] and [[Isabella of Portugal, Duchess of Burgundy|Isabella of Portugal]], the Duke and Duchess of Burgundy, he set foot on French soil again after 25 years, by now a middle aged man at 46 and "speaking better English than French," according to the English chronicler [[Raphael Holinshed]]. Philip the Good had made it a condition that the murder of Charles' father Louis of Orleans by Philip's own father, [[John the Fearless]], would not be avenged (John himself had been assassinated in 1419.)

Charles agreed to this condition prior to his release.{{sfn|Goldstone|2013|pp=225–226}} Meeting the Duchess of Burgundy after disembarking, the gallant Charles said: "M'Lady, I make myself your prisoner." At the celebration of his third marriage, with Marie of Cleves, he was created a [[Knight of the Golden Fleece]]. His subsequent return to [[Orléans]] was marked by a splendid celebration organised by the citizens.

He made an unsuccessful attempt to press his claims to Asti in Italy, before settling down as a celebrated patron of the arts. He died at [[Amboise]] in his 71st year.

==Marriage and children==

Charles married three times. His first wife [[Isabella of Valois]] (daughter of [[Charles VI of France]] and widow of [[Richard II of England]]), whom he married in [[Compiègne]] in 1406, died in childbirth.{{sfn|Goodrich|1967|p=11}} Their daughter, [[Joan of Valois, Duchess of Alençon|Joan]] married [[John II of Alençon]] in 1424 in Blois.{{sfn|Goodrich|1967|p=112}}

Afterwards, he married [[Bonne of Armagnac]],{{sfn|Goodrich|1967|p=11}} the daughter of [[Bernard VII, Count of Armagnac]], in 1410. Bonne died before he returned from captivity. The couple had no mutual children.

On his return to France in 1440, Charles married [[Marie of Cleves]]{{sfn|Goodrich|1967|p=11}} in [[Saint-Omer]] (daughter of [[Adolph I, Duke of Cleves]]) and had three children:
*[[Marie of Orléans (1457-1493)|Marie of Orléans]] (19 December 1457 – 1493, [[Mazères, Ariège|Mazères]]). Married [[John of Foix, Viscount of Narbonne|Jean of Foix]] in 1483.
*[[Louis XII of France]] (1462–1515)
* [[Anne of Orléans, Abbess of Fontevraud|Anne of Orléans]] (1464–1491, [[Poitiers]]), Abbess of [[Fontevrault]] and [[Holy Cross Abbey]] Poitiers.

* The critically acclaimed historical novel ''Het Woud der Verwachting / Le Forêt de Longue Attente'' (1949) by [[Hella Haasse]] (translated into English in 1989 under the title ''[[In a Dark Wood Wandering]]'') gives a sympathetic description of the life of Charles, Duke of Orléans.
