'''Edmund Josef von Horváth''' (9 December 1901, [[Sušak, Rijeka]], Austria-Hungary – 1 June 1938, Paris France) was an Austro-Hungarian playwright and novelist who wrote in the German language, and went by the name of ''nom de guerre'' '''Ödön von Horváth'''.

==Early life and education==
Ödön von Horváth was the eldest son of an Austro-Hungarian diplomat of Hungarian origin from [[Slavonia]], Edmund (Ödön) Josef Horvát, and Maria Lulu Hermine (Prehnal) Horvát, who was from an Austro-Hungarian military family.

From 1908, Ödön attended elementary school in Budapest, and later attended the ''[[Francis II Rákóczi|Rákóczi]]anum'', where his education was in the Hungarian language. In 1909, his father was ennobled and assigned to Munich, unaccompanied. In 1913, Horváth attended secondary school in [[Pressburg]] and Vienna, where he learned German as a second language, and earned the ''[[Matura]]'' (secondary school diploma) then reunited with his parents at Murnau am Staffelsee; from 1919, Horváth studied at the [[Ludwig Maximilians University]], in Munich.

==Later life and death==
He started writing as a student, from 1920. Quitting university without a degree in early 1922, he moved to Berlin. Later, he lived in Salzburg and Murnau am Staffelsee in Upper Bavaria. In 1931, he was awarded, along with [[Erik Reger]], the [[Kleist Prize]]. In 1933, at the beginning of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime in Germany, he relocated to Vienna.

Following Austria's [[Anschluss]] with Germany in 1938, Horváth emigrated to Paris.

Ödön von Horváth was hit by a falling branch from a tree and killed during a thunderstorm on the [[Champs-Élysées]] in Paris, opposite the ''[[Théâtre Marigny]]'', in June 1938. Ironically, only a few days earlier, von Horváth had said to a friend: "I am not so afraid of the Nazis...There are worse things one can be afraid of, namely things one is afraid of without knowing why. For instance, I am afraid of streets. Roads can be hostile to one, can destroy one. Streets scare me." And a few years earlier, von Horváth had written poetry about lightning: "Yes, thunder, that it can do. And bolt and storm. Terror and destruction."<ref>Hildebrand D. Horvath.

Ödön von Horváth was buried in [[Saint-Ouen, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Ouen]] cemetery in northern Paris.  In 1988, on the 50th anniversary of his death, his remains were transferred to Vienna and reinterred at the [[Heiligenstädter Friedhof]].

==Literary themes==
[[File:OdonHorvathGrave.JPG|thumb|Ödön von Horváth's family tombstone in Vienna]]
Important topics in Horváth's works were popular culture, politics and history. He especially tried to warn of the dawn of [[fascism]] and its dangers.  Among Horváth's more enduringly popular works, ''{{ill|Jugend ohne Gott|de}}'' (''Youth Without God'') describes the youth in [[Nazi Germany]] from a disgruntled teacher's point of view, who initially is an opportunist, but is helpless against the racist and militaristic [[Nazi propaganda]] that de-humanizes his pupils.

The title of his novel ''Ein Kind unserer Zeit'' (''[[A Child of Our Time]]'') was used in English by [[Michael Tippett]] for his [[oratorio]] (1939–1941), composed during World War II.

*"Nothing conveys the feeling of infinity as much as stupidity does." (Motto of ''Geschichten aus dem Wienerwald'')
*"Eigentlich bin ich ganz anders, nur komme ich so selten dazu." "Actually what I'm really like is very different. I just so rarely find time for it." (From ''Zur schönen Aussicht'')
*Ödön von Horváth was once walking in the [[Bavarian Alps]] when he discovered the skeleton of a long dead man with his knapsack still intact. Von Horváth opened the knapsack and found a postcard reading "Having a wonderful time". Asked by friends what he did with it, von Horváth replied "I posted it".
*"If you ask me what is my native country, I answer: I was born in [[Free State of Fiume|Fiume]], grew up in Belgrade, Budapest, Pressburg [Bratislava], Vienna and Munich, and I have a Hungarian passport, but I have no [[fatherland]]. I am a very typical mix of old Austria-Hungary: at once [[Hungarian people|Magyar]], [[Croatians|Croatian]], [[Germans|German]] and [[Czech people|Czech]]; my country is [[Hungary]]; my mother tongue is German."

==In popular culture==
*[[Christopher Hampton]]'s play ''[[Tales from Hollywood]]'' (1984, adapted for television in 1992) portrays a fictional Horváth. He survives the falling branch and moves to the United States, where expatriate German authors such as [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Heinrich Mann]] write for the motion picture industry.
*[[Danilo Kiš]]'s short story "The Man Without a Country", published in the 1994 collection ''The Lute and The Scars'', fictionalizes the death of von Horváth.
*[[Duncan Macmillan (playwright)|Duncan Macmillan]] adapted von Horváth’s ''[[Don Juan Comes Back From The War]]'' for the [[National Theatre Studio]] and [[Finborough Theatre]] in 2012.
