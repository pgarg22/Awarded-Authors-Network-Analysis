'''Dahlia Ravikovitch''' ({{lang-he|דליה רביקוביץ'}}; November 17, 1936 – August 21, 2005) was an [[Israel]]i poet, translator, and peace activist.

==Biography==
Ravikovitch was born in [[Ramat Gan]] on November 27, 1936. She learned to read and write at the age of three. Her father, Levi, was a [[Jews|Jewish]] engineer originally from Russia who arrived in [[Mandatory Palestine]] from China. Her mother, Michal, was a teacher who came from a religious household. When Dahlia was six, her father was run over and killed by a drunken driver. She moved to Kibbutz [[Geva]] with her mother but did not fit into the collectivist mentality and at 13 moved to a foster home in [[Haifa]], the first of several foster homes.<ref name=joffe>{{Cite news

}}</ref> It was in those formative years in Haifa that she wrote her very first poem, "Painting", which contrasted the blue of the seaside landscape to the yellow and grey of her inner world.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gold|first=Nili Scharf|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NUUzDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Haifa: City of Steps|date=2017-10-03|publisher=Brandeis University Press|isbn=978-1-5126-0119-0|language=en}}</ref>

Ravikovitch married at 18, but divorced after 3 months. Her subsequent marriages also ended in divorce. She has one son, Ido Kalir.<ref name="haaretz.com">Maya Sela (September 13, 2010) [https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/culture/1.5112345 "A living souvenir"], ''[[Haaretz]]''</ref> After completing her service in the [[Israel Defense Forces]], she studied at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. She worked as a journalist and high school teacher. She translated works of [[WB Yeats]], [[TS Eliot]] and [[Edgar Allan Poe]], and the book ''[[Mary Poppins (novel)|Mary Poppins]]'' into Hebrew.<ref name=joffe/> Ravikovitch was active in the [[Peace movement#Israel|Israeli peace movement]]. From her home in central [[Tel Aviv]] she collaborated with artists, musicians and public figures seeking peace, equality and social justice.

During the last years of her life, she suffered from severe bouts of depression.<ref name="haaretz.com"/> On August 21, 2005, Ravikovitch was found dead in her apartment. Initial reports speculated the cause of death to be [[suicide]], but the [[autopsy]] determined the cause to be sudden [[heart]] irregularities.

==Literary career==
Ravikovitch's first poems appeared in the [[Hebrew language]] poetry journal ''Orlogin'' (Hourglass), edited by [[Avraham Shlonsky]], and it was Shlonsky who encouraged her to pursue writing as a career. Her first book of poetry, ''The Love of an Orange'', published in 1959, established her as one of Israel's leading young native-born poets.<ref>''[[The Modern Hebrew Poem Itself]]'' (2003) {{ISBN|0-8143-2485-1}}</ref>

Her earlier poetry shows her command of formal technique without sacrificing the sensitivity of her always distinct voice. Although never totally abandoning traditional poetic devices, she developed a more prosaic style in the latter decades of her work. Her popular poem published in 1987, "The End of a Fall" (also called "The Reason for Falling") is from this period. Like many of Ravikovitch's poems, it may strike the reader as, at once, poignant, metaphysical, disturbing, and even political: "If a man falls from a plane in the middle of the night / only God can lift him up...".<ref>[http://www.ivrit.org/html/literary/born_to_dream.htm Born to Dream] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070415230210/http://www.ivrit.org/html/literary/born_to_dream.htm |date=2007-04-15 }} on Ivrit.org.</ref> In her book ''Haifa: City of Steps'' literary critic [[Nili Rachel Scharf Gold|Nili Gold]] has argued that Haifa and its landscape are crucial to understanding Ravikovitch's early poetry, most notably "Painting" and "Day Unto Day Uttereth Speech".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gold|first=Nili Scharf|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NUUzDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Haifa: City of Steps|date=2017-10-03|publisher=Brandeis University Press|isbn=978-1-5126-0119-0|language=en}}</ref> Gold has also argued against the popular interpretation of Ravikovitch's poem "Hovering at a Low Altitude" as a political poem, instead contending that it should be understood as a personal, lyrical one.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mintz|first=Alan L.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CLpPpspvmvIC&q=Nili+Gold#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Reading Hebrew Literature: Critical Discussions of Six Modern Texts|last2=Mintz|first2=Author Alan|date=2003|publisher=UPNE|isbn=978-1-58465-200-7|language=en}}</ref>

In all, Ravikovitch published ten volumes of poetry in her native Hebrew. In addition to poetry, she contributed prose works (including three collections of short stories) and children's literature, and translated poetry into Hebrew. Many of her poems were set to music. Her best known poem is ''Booba Memukenet'' ({{lang-en|Clockwork Doll}}).<ref>[http://www.thedrunkenboat.com/ravikovitch.htm Rabikovitch] on the Drunken Boat.</ref>

Her poems are taught in schools and universities. Scholars at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in Philadelphia sponsored a "Memorial in Piano, Poetry, and Song" in her honor on March 21, 2006; one of the performers at this event was the late Moroccan poet and performer, [[Fatema Chebchoub]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sas.upenn.edu/mec/events/2006/march/dahlia-ravikovitch-memorial-piano-poetry-and-song|title=Dahlia Ravikovitch: A Memorial in Piano, Poetry, and Song|last=Middle East Center, University of Pennsylvania|date=March 21, 2006|access-date=April 24, 2019}}</ref> Several of Ravikovitch's poems were turned into popular songs. Her poetry has been translated into 23 languages.<ref>[http://www.ithl.org.il/author_info.asp?id=209 Dahlia Ravikovitch, Institute for the Translation of Hebrew Literature] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716143031/http://www.ithl.org.il/author_info.asp?id=209 |date=2006-07-16 }}</ref>
