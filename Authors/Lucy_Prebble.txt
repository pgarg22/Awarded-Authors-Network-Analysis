Prebble's first play, ''[[The Sugar Syndrome]]'' was performed at the Royal Court in 2003 <ref name=Loveridge>Loveridge, Lizzie.

Her next theatre project ''[[Enron (play)|ENRON]]'', was based on the financial scandal and collapse of the American energy corporation of the same name. It was produced by theatre company Headlong at the Chichester Festival Theatre in 2009, under the direction of Rupert Goold.
