Her poetry books have been translated into Swedish, German and Spanish. Individual poems have been translated into more than twenty other languages.

=== Writing perspective ===
Although Forché is sometimes described as a political poet, she considers herself a poet who is politically engaged. After the publication of her second book, ''The Country Between Us'', which included poems describing what she had personally experienced in El Salvador at the beginning of the [[Salvadoran Civil War]], she responded to controversy concerning whether or not her work had become “political,” by researching and writing about poetry written in the aftermath of extremity in the 20th century. She proposed that such works not be read as narrowly “political” but rather as “poetry of witness." Her own aesthetic is more one of rendered experienced and at times of mysticism rather than one of ideology or agitprop. 

Forché is particularly interested in the effect of political trauma on the poet's use of language. The anthology ''Against Forgetting'' was intended to collect the work of poets who had endured the impress of extremity during the 20th century, whether through their engagements or force of circumstance. These experiences included warfare, military occupation, imprisonment, torture, forced exile, censorship, and house arrest.  The anthology, composed of the work of one hundred and forty-five poets writing in English and translated from over thirty languages, begins with the Armenian Genocide and ends with the uprising of the pro-Democracy movement at Tiananmen Square. Although she was not guided in her selections by the political or ideological persuasions of the poets, Forché believes the sharing of painful experience to be radicalizing, returning the poet to an emphasis on community rather than the individual ego. In this she was influenced by [[Terrence des Pres]], [[Hannah Arendt]], [[Martin Buber]], [[Simone Weil]] and [[Emmanuel Levinas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/forche/life.htm |title=Carolyn Forché's Life and Career |publisher=University of Illinois |work=Modern American Poetry |access-date=2013-09-24}}</ref>

Forché is also influenced by her [[Slovak people|Slovak]] family background, particularly the life story of her grandmother, an immigrant whose family included a woman resistance fighter imprisoned during the Nazi occupation of former Czechoslovakia. Forché was raised [[Roman Catholic]] and religious themes are frequent in her work.
