==Biography==
Dąbrowska was born Maria Szumska in [[Russów]] near [[Kalisz]], [[Congress Poland]], under [[Russian Partition|Tsarist military control]].<ref name="Tomasik" /> Her parents belonged to the impoverished [[landed gentry]] ([[Polish landed gentry|ziemiaństwo]]). Maria suffered from [[esotropia]], giving her a "cross-eyed" appearance. She studied sociology, philosophy, and natural sciences in [[Lausanne]] and [[Brussels]], and settled in [[Warsaw]] in 1917. Interested in both literature and politics, she devoted herself to help those born into poverty. In the [[Second Polish Republic|interwar period]], Dąbrowska worked temporarily in the Polish Ministry of Agriculture while venturing more and more into newspaper reporting and public life. In 1927 she became more involved in writing about [[human rights]]. In her novels, [[Play (theatre)|plays]] and newspaper articles she analyzed the psychological consequences of hardship and life's traumas in the world of ordinary people.

Maria married Marian Dąbrowski, who died suddenly when she was 36. Her second long-term partner was the 19-years-older Stanisław Stempowski, with whom she lived in a common-law marriage until the outbreak of [[World War II]].<ref name="Tomasik" /> During the [[History of Poland (1939–1945)|occupation of Poland]], she stayed in Warsaw and supported the cultural life of the Polish underground. At about that time, she met [[Anna Kowalska]] and Jerzy Kowalski, a literary couple. They formed a [[ménage à trois]], and Maria had a child by Jerzy in 1946, but he died suddenly in 1948. The two women stayed together in a relationship for the next 20 years, although Maria tried to get Anna married off again. Dąbrowska was awarded the [[Order of Polonia Restituta]] during the [[History of Poland (1945–1989)#Stalinist era (1948–56)|Stalinist period]]. In 1964 she was one of the signatories of the so-called '''''[[Letter of 34]]''''' to Prime Minister [[Józef Cyrankiewicz]], regarding freedom of culture. She died in 1965 at the age of 75, at the clinic in Warsaw.<ref name="Tomasik" />
