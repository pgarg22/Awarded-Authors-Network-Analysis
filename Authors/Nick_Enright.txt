'''Nicholas Paul Enright''' [[Member of the Order of Australia|AM]] (22 December 1950 – 30 March 2003) was an Australian dramatist, playwright and theatre director.

==Early life==
Enright was born on 22 December 1950{{citation needed|date=June 2021}} to a prosperous professional Catholic family in [[East Maitland, New South Wales|East Maitland]], [[New South Wales]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article130553150 |title=State Of Play |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |volume=70 |issue=21,952 |location=Australian Capital Territory, Australia |date=25 May 1995 |access-date=19 March 2016 |page=27 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> He was drama captain of [[St Ignatius' College, Riverview]] in [[Sydney]] in 1964, where, like [[Gerard Windsor]] and [[Justin Fleming]], he was taught by [[Melvyn Morrow]]. At that school, he won the 1sts Debating Premiership in both 1966 and 1967. It was expected{{by whom|date=June 2021}} that he would follow the law.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

During 1971 and 1972 Enright was a member of Sydney's [[Genesian Theatre]], performing in ''[[A Doll's House]]'' and ''[[Uncle Vanya]]'', and directing ''[[London Assurance]]''. Enright earned a BA from [[Sydney University]] in 1972.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

==Career==
He worked as a [[gofer]] for Sydney's [[Nimrod Theatre]] before being appointed a trainee director at the [[Melbourne Theatre Company]]. He won an [[Australia Council]] Fellowship to study directing at [[New York University]], graduating in 1977. On his return to Australia, he joined the [[State Theatre Company of South Australia]] as actor and director, later becoming Associate Director. He was Head of Acting at the [[National Institute of Dramatic Art|NIDA]] in 1983 and 1984.

He was encouraged to write plays while at NYU by one of his teachers, the playwright [[Israel Horovitz]]. His many plays include: ''Good Works'', ''[[Blackrock (play)|Blackrock]]'', ''Daylight Saving'', ''Mongrels'' (about the relation between Australian playwrights [[Jim McNeil]] and [[Peter Kenna]], the latter a friend), ''The Female Factory'', ''A Man with Five Children'', ''On the Wallaby'', and ''A Poor Student'', many of them published by [[Currency Press]]. His plays – which include French and Italian translations and adaptations –  have been performed by all major Australian theatre companies, including [[Sydney Theatre Company]], [[Company B (theatre)|Company B]], the [[Opera Australia|Australian Opera]] (as it then was), [[Melbourne Theatre Company]], [[Queensland Theatre Company]], [[State Theatre Company of South Australia]], the [[Ensemble Theatre]], [[Malthouse Theatre, Melbourne|Playbox]], [[La Boite Theatre]], and the [[Australian Theatre for Young People]]. His one-act theatre-in-education play ''A Property of the Clan'' was developed into the full-length play, and later film, ''[[Blackrock (film)|Blackrock]]'' (1997).

He wrote the book and lyrics to a number of musical works: three musicals with [[Terence Clarke (composer)|Terence Clarke]] – ''[[The Venetian Twins (musical comedy)|The Venetian Twins]]''; ''[[Variations (musical)|Variations]]'' (Winner, [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards|NSW Premier's Literary Play Award]], 1983); and ''[[Summer Rain (musical)|Summer Rain]]'' (commissioned for a graduating class at NIDA) -, and others with [[Alan John]] (''Orlando Rourke''), [[David King (composer)|David King]] (''The Betrothed'', ''The Voyage of Mary Bryant'', ''The Good Fight''), and [[Max Lambert]] (''[[Miracle City]]''); and an opera with [[Graham Dudley]] (''The Snow Queen''). He wrote the book of the original version of ''[[The Boy from Oz]]'', from the biography of the same name written by Stephen McLean which was produced by [[Ben Gannon (producer)|Ben Gannon]] with great success around Australia, and, after his death, in New York.

His adaptation, with [[Justin Monjo]], of [[Tim Winton]]'s ''[[Cloudstreet]]'' enjoyed huge critical and box-office success at the [[Sydney Festival|Sydney]] and [[Perth Festival]]s (whose co-production it was), on tour of Australia, at the Festival of Dublin, and in London.  He wrote for ABC Radio, including ''Watching over Israel'' (1990 [[AWGIE Awards|AWGIE]] winner, Best Radio Play). His non-dramatic work includes a book for children, ''The Maitland and Morpeth String Quartet'' (illustrated by [[Victoria Roberts (cartoonist)|Victoria Roberts]]), a set of verses for ''The Carnival of the Animals'', and occasional verse. He edited ''[[Holding the Man]]'', a memoir by his former [[National Institute of Dramatic Art|NIDA]] student, [[Timothy Conigrave]], and, following Conigrave's death, saw it to publication by [[Penguin Books]].

==Personal life==
Although he was openly gay, he never found his longed-for committed relationship.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/04/01/1048962754801.html David Marr, "Adored member of stage's family"], ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 2 April 2003; Retrieved 16 April 2013</ref>

After 15 years in remission, [[melanoma]] recurred; he died of cancer on 30 March 2003, at age 52. Three years after his death, ''[[Happy Feet]]'' was dedicated to his memory.

==Awards==
Enright was co-nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for his screenplay of ''[[Lorenzo's Oil]]'' (1992), co-written with its director [[George Miller (director)|George Miller]].

He received the [[Major AWGIE Award]] from the [[Australian Writers Guild]] four times, for the play ''[[Daylight Saving (play)|Daylight Saving]]'' (1990), the play ''A Property of the Clan'' (1993), the film screenplay  ''[[Blackrock (film)|Blackrock]]'' (1997) and the stage adaptation of ''Cloudstreet'' (1999, with Justin Monjo).

He received the inaugural Play Award at the [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards]] in 1983 with composer [[Terence Clarke (composer)|Terence Clarke]] for the musical ''[[Variations (musical)|Variations]]''.  This award is now named the Nick Enright Prize for Playwriting.

He won a [[Helpmann Award for Best New Australian Work]] in 2001 for the musical ''[[The Boy from Oz]]'', and was nominated in the same category the following year for ''A Man with Five Children''.

His many other awards include those from the [[Sidney Myer Performing Arts Awards]] (1998 Individual Winner) and the [[Green Room Awards]].

He had been appointed an [[Adjunct Professor]] in the School of Drama at the [[Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts]]; after his death, one of his former WAAPA students, [[Eddie Perfect]], wrote an [[elegy|elegiac]] song about him ('Someone like that').

==Honours==
In June 2004 his appointment as a Member of the [[Order of Australia]] was posthumously announced, although it was deemed effective from 14 November 2002.<ref name=gazette>[http://www.gg.gov.au/sites/default/files/files/honours/QB04.pdf Commonwealth of Australia Gazette No S 167, 14 June 2004] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403153620/http://gg.gov.au/sites/default/files/files/honours/QB04.pdf |date=3 April 2015 }}.
