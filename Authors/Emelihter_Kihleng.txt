==Biography==
Born in [[Guam]], she obtained a  [[master's degree]] in [[creative writing]] at the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa|University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa]] in 2003, and subsequently taught [[English as a second or foreign language|English as a second language]] at the [[College of Micronesia]] in Pohnpei. She later received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[Pacific studies]] from the [[Victoria University of Wellington]] in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pacificleaders.com/emelihter-kihleng-ph-d/|title=EMELIHTER KIHLENG, PH.D}}</ref> Her [[thesis|PhD Thesis]] was titled "Menginpehn Lien Pohnpei: a poetic ethnography of urohs (Pohnpeian skirts)".<ref>{{cite thesis|last=Kihleng|first=Emelihter|type=PhD|date=2015|title=Menginpehn Lien Pohnpei: a poetic ethnography of urohs (Pohnpeian skirts)|publisher=Victoria University of Wellington|hdl = 10063/4574}}</ref>

In May 2008, she published her first collection of poems, ''My Urohs''.<ref>Emelihter Kihleng, ''My Urohs'', 2008, Kahuaomanoa Press (Hawaiʻi), {{ISBN|0-9793788-3-4}}</ref> [[Samoa|Samoan]] writer [[Albert Wendt]] described her poetry as "refreshingly innovative and compelling, a new way of seeing ourselves in our islands, an important and influential addition to our literature" – meaning [[Pacific Islander]] literature.<ref>[http://www.honors.hawaii.edu/alumni/news.html "Alumni news"]{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa</ref> <!---file not found---->[[Kiribati|I-Kiribati]] poet [[Teresia Teaiwa]] described it as "[[ethnography|ethnographic]] poetry", "lush with the languages and imagery of Pohnpei and Micronesia", "an exciting new contribution to Pacific literature". Sāmoan writer [[Sia Figiel]] described her poetry as "disturbing and haunting, illuminating and tender", "woven from the violent threads of [[postcolonialism]], laced with patches of Island humour", "a powerful addition to Pacific Literature". [[United States|American]] poet [[Mark Nowak]] also praised her work.<ref>''My Urohs'', back cover</ref>

Kihleng explained that the ''urohs'' is "the quintessential dress of a Pohnpeian woman as a symbol of Pohnpeian women and Pohnpeian culture. I chose to title the collection ''My Urohs'' [...] because [...] the essence of the collection as a whole [is] colorful, tragic, beautiful, colonized and indigenous all at the same time".<ref name="doi.gov"/>

In February 2009, Kihleng and [[University of Guam]] professor of English Dr. Evelyn Flores announced their intention to publish the first ever anthology of [[Micronesia]]n literature, calling for contributions from writers from Guam, [[Palau]], the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], [[Nauru]], [[Kiribati]], the [[Marshall Islands]], and the [[Federated States of Micronesia]].<ref>[http://www.saipantribune.com/newsstory.aspx?cat=1&newsID=89828 "Planned Micronesian anthology calls for submissions"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214005417/http://www.saipantribune.com/newsstory.aspx?cat=1&newsID=89828 |date=2012-02-14 }}, ''Saipan Tribune'', April 30, 2009</ref> Kihleng noted that, while [[Polynesia]] and [[Melanesia]] had made a notable impact on Pacific literature, Micronesia still appeared to be "invisible".<ref>[http://guam.mvarietynews.com/index.php?view=article&id=4591%3Aseeking-micronesian-literary-writers&option=com_content&Itemid=2 "Seeking Micronesian literary writers"], ''Marianas Variety'', February 18, 2009</ref>

According to the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, "[m]uch of her work is about Pohnpeian identity and diaspora".<ref>[http://www2.hawaii.edu/~gharada/litevents.html "Local Literary Events Fall 2008"], University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa</ref> The [[Office of Insular Affairs]], a branch of the United States government's Department of the Interior, describes her as "one of the most gifted young writers in the Pacific".<ref name="doi.gov"/>

As of 2008, Kihleng lives in Guam, and, according to the United States government, is "working at the University of Guam's Violence Against Women Prevention Program".<ref name="doi.gov"/>
