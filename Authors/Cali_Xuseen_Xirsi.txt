There is no one consistent English translation of his name. Alternative spellings include Cabdulqaadir or Cabdilqaadir Xirsi.

==Early life and education==
Yamyam was born in the city of [[Dhuusa Mareeb]], [[Galgadud]] Region. Yamyam’s mother was Canoof Ibraahim. He was the youngest child of 6 and the only son to his mother as his other siblings had a different mother. 

Yamyam started attending [[Madrasa]] at age four  and he finished studying the [[Quran]] by age eight. He attended the Somali School of Natural Sciences. He moved to the north-west of the country to pursue further education and graduated from [[Mogadishu University]], producing hıs first work when he was 18 years old.  


He was Muslim, following the predominant religion in Somalia.

==Career==
He is famous both for his extensive study on [[peat bog]]s in the [[East Africa]] region and for his many poems and plays.

===New Playwrights with New Somali Orthography===
With the new [[Somali alphabet]] or orthography in 1972, Yamyam  became member of a minority Somali poets who pen down his works as opposed to poets producing volumes of poems in the traditional Somali oral literature.

Yamyam was recognized as an influential Somali poet and [[playwright]] whose creative output did not wane following the state's collapse and subsequent civil war which continued for a decade and a half. He lived in [[Mogadishu]] and continued to write poems and articles for Somali websites and newsletters on the misfortunes befallen on Somalia which was one of [[Africa]]'s strongest countries during post-colonial era.

==Awards==

===First Poetry Competition in Hargaisa===
Yamyam was the recipient of the first academic style Somali Poetry Competition held in [[Hargaisa]] in 1972.
On Somali National Patriotic Programme Series, a 12 part series which aired on June 2013, Aamin Media Limited, placed Yamyam at Episode #8, right next to Abdullahi Suldan Tima Ade, another great Somali poet.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.aaminmedialimited.com/about/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-06-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304131416/http://www.aaminmedialimited.com/about/# |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The program profiles 12 great patriots and military persons who lived from mid 1400 to contemporary Somali heroes.

Yamyam, as most other gifted entertainers, used his poetic talents to highlight the misfortunes that befell on his fellow Somalis as the result of the civil war and the ensuing chaos. He had a sense of humour that attracted both the young and old across Somali society.

Suldan Tima Cade's patriotic poems throughout the 1950 to 1970s were extended by Yamyam who continued the patriot legacy with new interpretations of social and politics aspects in Somali life and adding his footprints on Somali Literature from the early 1970s until his death in 2005.

==Moving to Mogadishu==
After winning first of its kind poetry competition in Hargeisa in 1972, Yamyam moved to Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia. He immediately found a job at the newly created National Folklore, Arts, Culture, Literature, which had such important cultural centers such as Somali National Theatre.

At his tenure at [[SNAC]] center in Mogadishu, he wrote many poems, plays and other literary pieces. He worked for several government ministries and contributed to on air radio programs such as [[Radio Mogadishu]] and [[Radio Hargeysa|Radio Hargaisa]] and higher learning institutions, primarily, [[Somali National University]] at [[Gaheyr]] and [[Lafoole]].

==Poetry and Public Services==
Some of his more famous poems are ''Gabay ammaan ah'' (A poem of praise), ''Kowda Maajo: Hambalyo 1975'' (The First of May: Congratulations 1975), "Hees" (A hees poem), and ''Ma riyaa ma run baa'' (Is it a dream? Is it reality?).<ref name="first"/> Two of his poems appeared in the magazines ''Sahan'' (Reconnaissance)  and ''Horseed'' (Vanguard), although most of them still reached the public in oral form. Cali often wrote on social topics. One of his poems, for instance, was a commentary on the political situation of the [[Somali people]] in the late 1950s, and another, written in 1962, was a protest against the import of foreign cars when the mass of the people were still living in poverty.<ref>Tyloch, p.371–2</ref>

===Researcher and Contributor at SNAC===
Yamyam was engaged in the Somali National [[folklore]] and poetry circles for nearly four decades. At the height of the Somali [[Military Revolution]], Yamyam wrote poems directly accusing the government of attempting to create new social programs while much needed social programs lay in abandonment. One such poem was ' Digo rogasho' which he wrote in October 1984.
In the early 1970s he went to the capital, Mogadishu, where he joined Waaberi (literally Dawn), a troupe of singers, dancers and playwrights. His genius at writing [[lyrics]] and poems was soon recognized by his contemporaries and his songs were performed on Radio Mogadishu.

===Influencing Somali Society and Politics===
Abdulkadir Yamyam co-authored with Ahmed Farah Ali Idaajaa for a popular play (primarily in verse) called ''Dabkuu Shiday Darwiishkii'' (The Fire that the Dervish Lit) about the anti-colonial resistance waged by the [[Dervish State|Somali Dervishes]] under the leadership of Sayid [[Mohamed Abdulle Hassan]] from 1900 to 1920.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://scansom.com/index.php?manufacturers_id=61|title=Abdulqadir Hirsi "Yamyam and A, Scansom Publisher|website=scansom.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-03}}</ref><ref name="lit">{{cite book|last=Tyloch|first=edited by B.W. Andrzejewski, S. Pilaszewicz, W.|title=Literatures in African languages : theoretical issues and sample surveys|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-12625-0|pages=372|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gfH2A6AhZ7wC&q=%22the+fire+which+the+dervish+lit%22&pg=PA372}}</ref><ref name="guard"/>

Farah Idaja wrote, that, Yamyam's play, about [[Somali Dervishes]], Fire that the [[Dervish]] Lit, "Dabdkuu Shiday Darwiishkii" where the play's first scene depicts imagined scenes from European powers' conference in Barlin during 1884-1885 Africa colonial divisions.  Although, Yamyam was a patriot, he often reflected [[Europe]]an colonial past wrongdoings from 1884 [[Africa divisions]] to the 1894 "Tripartite Accord" from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]], [[Italy]] and [[Ethiopia]].

His poetry reflected radicalism and dislike for the misuse of power and misappropriation of public funds of the toppled regime in Somalia in the 1970s and 1980s. Mind you, Yamyam was only four uncles removed to President [[Siad Barre]] and he was not easy on him- this came to light when later during the civil war he remained in Mogadishu despite his closeness to the overthrown president.

===Civil War Years and Arta Peace Conference===
Before he moved this August to the US to rejoin his family, who had settled there after the civil war in Somalia, Yam Yam (varyıng spellıng) lived in Mogadishu. Unfazed by the lawlessness. Throughout the 1990s decades at the heıght of two-decade long Somali civil war, he did not align himself with any of the tribal factions in Somalia. He felt a moral obligation to promote peace in his troubled country.

At the [[Attempts at reconciliation in Somalia (1991–2004)#2000 Somalia National Peace Conference|Somalia National Peace Conference]] held in 2000, YamYam described the national of Somalia as "in ruins" and said he no longer celebrated national holidays.<ref>{{cite news|title=In-depth: Somali National Peace Conference|url=http://www.irinnews.org/IndepthMain.aspx?reportid=72039&indepthid=54|access-date=23 December 2011|newspaper=IRIN|date=10 July 2000|agency=UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs}}</ref>

Yamyam is survived by his wife, four sons and two daughters. Rage, the eldest son of Yamyam is ın his own right a poet. He was one of the main entertainers of the 2007 annual Somali Community gathering honoring youngsters who achieve great academic success.
Unlike most [[Somali poets]], Yamyam penned down all his literary work starting from early on before he won the first academically conducted [[poetry]] competition held in Hargaisa.

"I am Somali"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://shafisaid.wordpress.com/2007/11/13/i-am-somali/|title=I am Somali|date=2007-11-13|work=Incoherent Thoughts...|access-date=2018-01-03|language=en-US}}</ref>

In print material, the poet's name has varying spellings for his nickname, Yamyam or Yam Yam. Many people believe Yamyam was a long ago deceased poet at the time of ''Hooyaaleey'' style Somali poetry during the mid eighteenth century at time of Raage Ugaas and others because of in-depth content which he is unique for in his field as a great poet coupled with the academic work which he penned down, for example, his first play co-authoring with [[Ahmed Farah Ali 'Idaja']], using the newly created Somali [[orthography]].

Ordinarily, Somali poets produce volumes of oral literature full of [[tribal feud]] but Yam Yam was an academic type, thus he refrained from using poetry and plays to "side with any of opposing sides"<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/|title=IRIN|website=IRIN|access-date=2018-01-03}}</ref> although he remained in Mogadishu throughout the 1990s when Mogadishu was the epicenter of the Somali civil war. In 2001, Yam Yam moved to Nairobi, Kenya to settling in [[Nairobi]].

While contributing to volumes of poems and dozens of plays for a span of nearly forty years, Yamyam is credited with numerous contributions and collaborations during the height of the [[civil war in Somalia]] from 1991 to his death in Columbus Ohio in 2005. Yamyam was greatly appreciated at his appearances at the year-long [[Somali National Peace Conference]] better known as ''Arta Peace Conference'', held in Arta, [[Djibouti]].

Yamyam grew up in Hargaisa but he remained in Mogadishu for much of his working life including a decade and a half, a period when the Somali civil war years were at climax. When it came to show his patriotism, Yamyam gave hours of poetry entertainment and a dose of reality for the year-long ''Arta Somali Peace Conference''.

During the Arta Peace Conference, on the occasion of June 26 Northern Somalia [[Independence Day]], He reminded every Somali that, he no longer celebrated independence days as Somalia "lay in ruins",<ref name="auto"/> since the choas and lawlessness in the capital Mogadishu.

==Later life==
Abdulkadir Hersi Siyad, better known by his nickname Yamyam, died in a car accident in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Ohio]], [[United States]] aged 60.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/dec/19/obituaries.mainsection|title=Obituary: Abdulkadir Hersi|last=Ahmad|first=Liban|date=2005-12-19|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=2018-01-03|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>
