'''John Edward McKenzie Lucie-Smith''' (born 27 February 1933), known as '''Edward Lucie-Smith''', is a  Jamaican-born English writer, poet, art critic, curator and broadcaster.  He has been highly prolific in these fields, writing or editing over a hundred books, his subjects gradually shifting around the late 1960s from mostly literature to mostly art.

==Biography==
Lucie-Smith was born in [[Kingston, Jamaica]], the son of Mary Frances (née Lushington) and John Dudley Lucie-Smith. He moved to the United Kingdom in 1946.<ref name="edwardlucie-smith.info">Biography [http://www.edwardlucie-smith.info/biography.htm Retrieved 4 October 2018.]</ref> He was educated at [[The King's School, Canterbury]], and, after a little time in [[Paris]], he read History at [[Merton College, Oxford]] from 1951 to 1954.<ref name=MCreg>{{cite book|editor1-last=Levens|editor1-first=R.G.C.|title=Merton College Register 1900-1964|date=1964|publisher=Basil Blackwell|location=Oxford|page=426}}</ref>

After serving in the [[Royal Air Force]] as an Education Officer and working as a copywriter,<ref name=MCreg /> he became a full-time writer (as well as anthologist and photographer). He succeeded [[Philip Hobsbaum]] in organising [[The Group (literature)|The Group]], a London-centred poets' group.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/apr/23/peter-porter-obituary|title=Peter Porter obituary|last=Potts|first=Robert|date=23 April 2010|work=The Guardian|access-date=7 February 2011}}</ref>

At the beginning of the 1980s he conducted several series of interviews, ''Conversations with Artists'', for [[BBC Radio 3]]. He was a contributor to ''[[The London Magazine]]'', in which he wrote art reviews, and wrote regularly for the independent magazine ''[[ArtReview]]'' from the 1960s until the 2000s. A prolific writer, he has written more than one hundred books in total on a variety of subjects, chiefly art history as well as biographies and poetry.<ref name="edwardlucie-smith.info"/>

In addition he has curated a number of art exhibitions, including three [[Peter Moores (businessman)|Peter Moores]] projects at the [[Walker Art Gallery]] in [[Liverpool]]; the New British Painting (1988–90) and two retrospectives at the [[New Orleans Museum of Art]]. He is a curator of the [[Bermondsey]] Project Space.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lucie-Smith|first1=Edward|title=Edward Lucie-Smith: Uncollected Writings|date=2012|publisher=Cv publications|isbn=978-1908419460|page=115|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ionulgp4Un8C&q=%22Edward+Lucie-Smith%22+biography&pg=PA115|access-date=14 July 2014}}</ref>

In recent years Edward Lucie-Smith has been promoting drawings attributed to Francis Bacon owned by Italian journalist Cristiano Lovatelli Ravarino. However, Christie's, Sotheby's and the Francis Bacon Estate have not authenticated these works known as the 'Francis Bacon Italian Drawings'. Martin Harrison, the editor of the Francis Bacon: Catalogue Raisonné, does not include 'The Francis Bacon Italian Drawings' and does not see the hand of Bacon in these drawings.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

His uncle [[Euan Lucie-Smith]] was one of the first mixed-heritage infantry officers in a regular British Army regiment, and the first killed in World War I.<ref name="Sanderson">{{cite news |last1=Sanderson |first1=Ginny |title=First black British officer of First World War was Eastbourne student |url=https://www.eastbourneherald.co.uk/news/people/first-black-british-officer-first-world-war-was-eastbourne-student-3011999 |access-date=16 November 2020 |work=www.eastbourneherald.co.uk |date=22 October 2020 }}</ref>
