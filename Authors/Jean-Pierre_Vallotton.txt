What critics have said about
Jean-Pierre Vallotton's poetry:
"With neither complaint nor joy – uncompromising words." 
(Constuire)
"A perfect and elegant writing that softly sings about love."
(Arpa)
"His poetry book traces a need for deep communion, for
transcendental essence, the light of which is a symbol closest
to the absolute."
(Rétro-Viseur)
"Profusion and sobriety converge in this pursuit of a learned
language of poetry."
(Le Courrier de l ’Escaut)
"Here is poetry, vibrantly so. the divine breathe of
inspiration transcends anguish, and opens to new life."
(Lettres et Cultures de Langue Française)
"Poetry opening to all horizons, to duration, and essentially
to what is presence."
(Le Journal des Poètes)
"More than the macroscopic of the surreal, Jean-Pierre Vallotton explores
the microscopic of hyperreality. In fact, if there is one single element in
this complex poetry that stands out, it is precisely the absence of
anything obvious. Yet his idiosyncratic poetic structure never disrupts its
symbolic density. Behind the irregularity of forms, there is recurrence,
tempo, permanency of pursuit. Where other poets of his generation
developed strategies of deconstruction, Vallotton invented a brave new
mosaic with the parameters left behind by traditionalism, modernism
and postmodernism. If William Wordsworth, Oscar Wilde, T.S. Eliot
are considered decadent, then so is Jean-Pierre Vallotton a decadent,
however, the sort of decadent that will be viewed as being great in years
to come: ''the space between us is a path of magnificence, and here the
faintest of our ''footsteps draws forth a flower''. His neo-baroque poetry
stands at the crossroads of whatever styles, forms, and contents
led to this spot; and it is with the pernicious artefacts found here that
Jean-Pierre Vallotton invents the unknown structures that will welcome
the birds of paradise of tomorrow." (Antonio D’Alfonso, in Wings Folded in Cracks)
