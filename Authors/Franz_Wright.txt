{{short description|American poet}}
'''Franz Wright''' (March 18, 1953 – May 14, 2015) was an American poet. He and his father [[James Wright (poet)|James Wright]] are the only parent/child pair to have won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in the same category.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poet.html?id=7562|title=Franz Wright|work=poetryfoundation.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-franz-wright-pulitzer-prize-poet-dies-20150515-story.html|title=Franz Wright, Pulitzer Prize-winning poet, dies at 62|author=Los Angeles Times|date=15 May 2015|work=latimes.com}}</ref>

==Life and career==
Wright was born in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. He graduated from [[Oberlin College]] in 1977.

''Wheeling Motel'' (Knopf, 2009), had selections put to music for the record ''Readings from Wheeling Motel''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/readings-from-wheeling-motel/id329451909|title=iTunes - Music - Readings from Wheeling Motel by Franz Wright|work=iTunes}}</ref>  Wright wrote the lyrics to and performs the [[Clem Snide]] song "Encounter at 3AM" on the album ''Hungry Bird'' (2009). Wright's most recent books include ''Kindertotenwald'' (Knopf, 2011), a collection of sixty-five prose poems concluding with  a love poem to his wife, written while Wright had terminal lung cancer. The poem  won ''Poetry'' magazine's premier annual literary prize for best work published in the magazine during 2011. The prose poem collection was followed in 2012 by ''Buson: Haiku,'' a collection of translations of 30 haiku by the Japanese poet [[Yosa Buson]], published in a limited edition of a few hundred copies by Tavern Books.

In 2013, Wright's primary publisher, Knopf in New York, brought out another full length collection of verse and prose poems, ''F'', which was begun in the ICU of a Boston hospital after excision of part of a lung. ''F'' was the most positively received of any of Wright's work. Writing in the ''Huffington Post'', Anis Shivani placed it among the best books of poetry yet produced by an American, and called Wright "our greatest contemporary poet."

In 2013, Wright recorded 15 prose poems from ''Kindertotenwald'' for inclusion in a series of improvisational concerts performed in European venues, arranged by [[David Sylvian]], [[Stephan Mathieu]] and [[Christian Fennesz]].<ref name="The Kilowatt Hour">{{cite web |last=Sylvian |first=David |title=Franz Wright |url=http://www.davidsylvian.com/theresalight/franz_wright.html |website=The Kilowatt Hour|publisher=davidsylvian.com|access-date=17 July 2014}}</ref>

Prior to his death, Wright completed his final manuscript, entitled "Axe in Blossom," which is forthcoming from Knopf.

Wright has been anthologised in works such as ''The Best of the Best American Poetry'' as well as [[Czeslaw Milosz]]'s anthology ''A Book of Luminous Things''<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z0onVhP_F1MC&q=Franz+Wright&pg=PA138|title=The Best American Poetry 2008|work=google.com|isbn=9781416579663|last1=Wright|first1=Charles|last2=Lehman|first2=David|date=16 September 2008}}</ref> ''Bearing the Mystery: Twenty Years of Image'',<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=eRbu97k2kpEC&pg=PA404&dq=Franz+Wright&lr=&ei=-iX9S6rBD4nazQSvqYH4Ag&cd=13#v=onepage&q=Franz%20Wright&f=false "Language as Sacrament in the New Testament"] Editor Gregory Wolfe, Wm.

===Death===
Wright died of lung cancer at his home in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]] on May 14, 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.sfgate.com/bookmarks/2015/05/15/franz-wright-pulitzer-prize-winning-poet-dead-at-age-62/ |title=Franz Wright, Pulitzer Prize-winning poet, dead at age 62 |last=McMurtrie |first=John |date=May 15, 2015 |publisher=[[SFGate]] |access-date=May 17, 2015}}</ref>

==Criticism==
Writing in the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'', [[Helen Vendler]] said "Wright's scale of experience, like [[John Berryman|Berryman's]], runs from the homicidal to the ecstatic... [His poems'] best forms of originality [are] deftness in patterning, startling metaphors, starkness of speech, compression of both pain and joy, and a stoic self-possession with the agonies and penalties of existence."<ref name="vendler">{{cite journal |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2007/oct/11/from-the-homicidal-to-the-ecstatic/ |title=From the Homicidal to the Ecstatic |journal=New York Review of Books |date=October 11, 2007 |first=Helen |last=Vendler |access-date=May 17, 2015}}</ref> Novelist [[Denis Johnson]] has said Wright's poems "are like tiny jewels shaped by blunt, ruined fingers--miraculous gifts."{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} The ''[[Boston Review]]'' has called Wright's poetry "among the most honest, haunting, and human being written today."<ref>[http://bostonreview.net/BR26.2/paquin.html ''Boston Review'']</ref> Poet and critic Ernest Hilbert wrote for [[Random House]]'s magazine ''Bold Type'' that "Wright oscillates between direct and evasive dictions, between the barroom floor and the arts club podium, from aphoristic aside to icily poetic abstraction."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/boldtype/0101/wright/essay.html|title=Penguin Random House|work=PenguinRandomhouse.com}}</ref> ''Walking to Martha's Vineyard'' (2003) in particular, was well received. According to ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', the collection features "[h]eartfelt but often cryptic poems...fans will find Wright's self-diagnostics moving throughout."<ref>[http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-375-41518-0 "WALKING TO MARTHA'S VINEYARD"] ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' September 1, 2003</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted that Wright promises, and can deliver, great depths of feeling, while observing that Wright depends very much on our sense of his tone, and on our belief not just that he means what he says but that he has said something new...[on this score] ''Walking to Martha's Vineyard'' sometimes succeeds."<ref>{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B06EFDB173CF932A15751C1A9659C8B63 | work=The New York Times | title=Long Nights, Short Years | first=Stephen | last=Burt | date=December 21, 2003}}</ref>

Poet [[Jordan Davis (poet)|Jordan Davis]], writing for ''The Constant Critic'', suggested that Wright's collection was so accomplished it would have to be kept "out of the reach of impulse kleptomaniacs." Added Davis, "deader than deadpan, any particular Wright poem may not seem like much, until, that is, you read a few of them. Once the context kicks in, you may find yourself trying to track down every word he's written."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.constantcritic.com/archive.cgi?rev=Jordan_Davis&name=Walking%20to%20Martha's%20Vineyard |title=''Constant Critic'' review |access-date=2007-08-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814130213/http://www.constantcritic.com/archive.cgi?rev=Jordan_Davis&name=Walking%20to%20Martha's%20Vineyard |archive-date=2007-08-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Some critics were less welcoming. According to ''[[New Criterion]]'' critic [[William Logan (poet)|William Logan]], with whom Wright would later publicly feud, "[t]his poet is surprisingly vague about the specifics of his torment (most of his poems are shouts and curses in the dark). He was cruelly affected by the divorce of his parents, though perhaps after forty years there should be a statute of limitation... 'The Only Animal,' the most accomplished poem in the book, collapses into the same kitschy sanctimoniousness that puts nodding Jesus dolls on car dashboards."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/Stouthearted-men-1481|title=Stouthearted men by William Logan - The New Criterion|work=newcriterion.com}}</ref> "Wright offers the crude, unprocessed sewage of suffering", he comments. "He has drunk harder and drugged harder than any dozen poets in our health-conscious age, and paid the penalty in hospitals and mental wards."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/From--ldquo-stinko-rdquo--to-Devo-4347|title=From "stinko" to Devo by William Logan - The New Criterion|work=newcriterion.com}}</ref>

The critical reception of Wright's 2011 collection, ''Kindertotenwald'' (Knopf), has been positive on the whole. Writing in the ''Washington Independent Book Review'', [[Grace Cavalieri]] speaks of the book as a departure from Wright's best known poems. "The prose poems are intriguing thought patterns that show poetry as mental process... This is original material, and if a great poet cannot continue to be original, then he is really not all that great... In this text there is a joyfulness that energizes and makes us feel the writing as a purposeful surge. It is a life force. This is a good indicator of literary art... Memory and the past, mortality, longing, childhood, time, space, geography and loneliness, are all the poet's playthings. In these conversations with himself, Franz Wright shows how the mind works with his feelings and his brain's agility in its struggle with the heart."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonindependentreviewofbooks.com/?s=%22show+poetry+as+mental+process%22|title=Washington Independent Review of Books|work=washingtonindependentreviewofbooks.com}}</ref>

Cultural critic for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''  Julia Keller says that ''Kindertotenwald'' is  "ultimately about joy and grace and the possibility of redemption, about coming out whole on the other side of emotional catastrophe."<ref Name="Keller"/> "This collection, like all of Wright's book, combines familiar, colloquial phrases--the daily lingo you hear everywhere--with the sudden sharpness of a phrase you've never heard anywhere, but that sounds just as familiar, just as inevitable. These pieces are written in closely packed prose, like miniature short stories, but they have a fierce lilting beauty that marks them as poetry. Reading 'Kindertotenwald' is like walking through a plate-glass window on purpose. There is--predictably--pain, but once you've made it a few steps past the threshold, you realize it wasn't glass after all, only air, and that the shattering sound you heard was your own heart breaking. Healing, though, is possible. "Soon, soon," the poet writes in "Nude With Handgun and Rosary," "between one instant and the next, you will be well."<ref Name="Keller">{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/books/ct-ent-0922-wright-lynch-review-20110921,0,3451472.column|title=The Sin-Eater: A Breviary by Thomas Lynch and Kindertotenwald by Franz Wright - Chicago Tribune|author=Chicago Tribune|date=21 September 2011|work=chicagotribune.com}}</ref>
