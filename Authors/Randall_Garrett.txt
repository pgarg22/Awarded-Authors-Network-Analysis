'''Gordon Randall Phillip David Garrett'''<ref name=EncyclopediaOfFantasy1997> [http://sf-encyclopedia.uk/fe.php?nm=garrett_randall Garrett, Randall] in ''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]''; edited by [[John Clute]] and [[John Grant (science fiction writer)|John Grant]]; published 1997</ref> (December 16, 1927 – December 31, 1987) was an American [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] author. He was a contributor to ''[[Astounding]]'' and other science fiction magazines of the 1950s and 1960s. He instructed [[Robert Silverberg]] in the techniques of selling large quantities of action-adventure science fiction, and collaborated with him on two novels about men from Earth disrupting a peaceful agrarian civilization on an alien planet.

==Biography and writing career==
[[File:Randall Garrett - Unwise Child - book cover.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''Unwise Child'' by Garrett]]
Garrett is best known for the [[Lord Darcy (fiction)|Lord Darcy]] books — the novel ''[[Too Many Magicians]]'' and two short story collections — set in an [[alternate history (fiction)|alternate world]] where a joint Anglo-French empire still led by a [[Plantagenet]] dynasty has survived into the twentieth century and where magic works and has been scientifically codified. The Darcy books are rich in jokes, puns, and references (particularly to works of [[detective fiction|detective]] and [[spy fiction]]: Lord Darcy is modeled on [[Sherlock Holmes]]), elements often appearing in the shorter works about the detective. [[Michael Kurland]] wrote two additional Lord Darcy novels.

Garrett wrote under a variety of [[pseudonym]]s including: David Gordon, John Gordon, Darrel T. Langart (an [[anagram]] of his name), Alexander Blade, Richard Greer, Ivar Jorgensen, Clyde Mitchell, Leonard G. Spencer, S. M. Tenneshaw, Gerald Vance. He was also a founding member of the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]], as "Randall of Hightower" (a pun on "garret"). The short novel ''Brain Twister'', written by Garrett with author [[Laurence Janifer]] (using the joint pseudonym [[Mark Phillips (author)|Mark Phillips]]), was nominated for the [[Hugo Award for Best Novel]] in 1960.

An inveterate punster (defining a pun as "the odor given off by a decaying mind"), he was a favorite guest at science fiction conventions and friend to many fans, especially in Southern California.  According to various anecdotes in a tribute volume, Garrett was cherished by his friends, who often repeated anecdotes of his behavior, but horrified many women, to whom he routinely introduced himself with obscene propositions.<ref name="Best">'Robert Silverberg, ed., 'The Best of Randall Garrett'', 1982 Pocket Books {{ISBN|0-671-83574-2}}</ref>  He introduced himself to [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]] with the Latin sentence "Coito ergo sum,"<ref name="IROSF">{{cite web|date=September 2009|title=The Clown Prince of Science Fiction: Inside the Wild and Undisciplined Mind Of Randall Garrett|first=Mark|last=Cole|url=http://www.irosf.com/q/zine/article/10578|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180324014006/http://www.irosf.com/q/zine/article/10578|archive-date=2018-03-24|website=Internet Review of Science Fiction}}</ref>([[sic]]) which she didn't understand until it was explained to her some time later as an obscenity, and at another time to a pregnant [[Anne McCaffrey]] with "sly innuendoes" which horrified her.  [[Philip José Farmer]] recounted an anecdote where Garrett was punched by his then-wife for having a pair of someone else's lace underpants in his pocket, and later ran naked through a hotel after being caught having sex with another woman in the wrong room.<ref name=PJFarmer>"The Man Who Came For Christmas", by [[Philip José Farmer]], in ''The Best of Randall Garrett'' (pp. 7 - 9); edited by [[Robert Silverberg]]; published 1982 by [[Timescape Books]]</ref>  [[Frank Herbert]] said "You could follow his movements around this [[Society for Creative Anachronism|creative Anachronists']] picnic by the squeals of the women whose bottoms he had just pinched."  [[Isaac Asimov]] referred to Garrett's offending [[Judith Merril]] enough, she emptied an ashtray over his and Garrett's heads.<ref name="Best"/>

Garrett was married to fellow author [[Vicki Ann Heydron]] who largely wrote the ''Gandalara Cycle'' fantasy series credited to both spouses.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Davis Nicoll |first1=James |title=Fighting Erasure: Women SF Writers of the 1970s, Part III |url=https://www.tor.com/2018/03/14/fighting-erasure-women-sf-writers-of-the-1970s-part-iii// |access-date=28 April 2020 |work=[[Tor.com]] |date=28 April 2020}}</ref>

In 1999, Randall Garrett was posthumously awarded the [[Sidewise Award for Alternate History]] Special Achievement Award for the Lord Darcy series. He was also ordained in the [[Old Catholic Church]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20000818091835/http://www.adherents.com/lit/sf_christian_edman.html Adherents.com]</ref><ref name="IROSF"/> [[Glen Cook]]'s private detective character [[Garrett P.I.]] is named in honor of Garrett.<ref>[http://www.oreillynet.com/xml/newsletters/040808-xml-news.html Understanding XML: Reinventing wheels] at [[O'Reilly Media]]; published April 8, 2008; retrieved November 16, 2012</ref>

==Health==
In the summer of 1979,<ref name="Best"/> Garrett contracted a viral infection which led to  [[meningitis]],<ref name=EncyclopediaOfFantasy1997/> and/or [[encephalitis]].<ref name=AnalogObit/>
<!-- WHAT ABOUT THE COMA you might ask. No. Sorry. My bad. Check the talk page for explanation. That's why I've gone to the trouble of not just citing the sources, but explaining in the text where the info comes from.-->

In ''The Best of Randall Garrett'', a combined anthology and [[festschrift]] which was published in January of 1982, editor Robert Silverberg (a personal friend of Garrett's) stated that although the infection "for a time threatened [Garrett's] life and for a much longer time has made it impossible for him to work", Garrett was "fighting his way back to full recovery" <ref name="Best"/> — and, indeed, when [[Algis Budrys]] reviewed the anthology in the August 1982 issue of ''[[the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction]]'', he stated that he had been told that "when last seen, Garrett was seated at a dinner table, cheerfully ignoring the assembled company and attempting to remember the words to a dirty song";<ref name=F&SF>"Books", review column by [[Algis Budrys]], in ''[[the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction]]''; August 1982; p 23</ref> however, in October 1982, [[Dave Langford]] reported that the [[Hugo Award]] ceremony at [[40th World Science Fiction Convention|that year's Worldcon]] had included an announcement that Garrett "had permanently lost his memory".<ref name=Ansible>[https://news.ansible.uk/a29.html Ansible #29], October 1982; by [[Dave Langford]]; retrieved June 21, 2020</ref> By 1986, the "about the authors" text in the novel ''The River Wall'', credited to Garrett and Vicki Ann Heydron, described Garrett as having suffered "serious and permanent injury",<ref name=RiverWall>''The River Wall'', by Randall Garrett and Vicki Ann Heydron; published 1986 by [[Bantam Spectra]]</ref> and in 2011, Langford and [[Brian M. Stableford]]'s entry on Garrett in ''[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]'' summarized him as having been "hospitalized from 1981 until his death" in 1987.<ref name=TEoSF2011>[http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/garrett_randall Garrett, Randall], by [[Dave Langford]] and [[Brian M.

It was actually written by Jack Bennett and originally published under the title "Ben Ali the Egyptian".<ref name="egyptian">{{cite journal|author1=Jack Bennett|title=Ben Ali the Egyptian|journal=St. Nicholas Magazine|date=July 1893|pages=696 et seq.|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00065513/00257/59}}</ref> Parts of "Ben Ali the Egyptian" ''were'' quoted in Garrett's short story "The Foreign Hand Tie."
