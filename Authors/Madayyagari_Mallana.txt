'''Mallana''' (15th century) was a [[Telugu language|Telugu]] [[poet]] and one of the ''[[Astadiggajas]]'' (literally means eight elephants) in the [[noble court|court]] of the [[monarch|king]] [[Krishnadevaraya]].

==Biography==
He said that his birthplace was part of [[Rayalaseema]] (means land ruled by Rayas, [[Vijayanagara]] kings) in his works. He accompanied Krishnadevaraya in his military travels. He dedicated his work to Nadendla Appana (popularly known as Appaji), the governor of [[Kondavidu]] and nephew of a Minister called Saluava Timmana in the [[Vijayanagara Empire]].

==Works==
His popular work is ''Rajasekara Charitram'' on the military and romantic conquests of Rajasekara, a king of [[Avanti (India)|Avanti]].

== Style ==
Like other poets of Prabhanda (fiction) period, his story seems completely original and there is no [[Sanskrit]] equivalent to it.  Compared to his contemporaries, he is restrained in presenting romance.
