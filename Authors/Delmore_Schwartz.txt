'''Delmore Schwartz''' (December 8, 1913 – July 11, 1966)  was an American [[poet]] and [[short story]] writer.

==Early life==
Schwartz was born in 1913 in [[Brooklyn, New York]], where he also grew up. His parents, Harry and Rose, both [[Romanian Jews]], separated when Schwartz was nine, and their divorce had a profound effect on him. He had a younger brother, Kenneth.<ref>1930 United States Federal Census</ref> In 1930, Schwartz's father suddenly died at the age of 49. Though Harry had accumulated a good deal of wealth from his dealings in the real estate business, Delmore inherited only a small amount of that money as the result of the shady dealings of the executor of Harry's estate. According to Schwartz's biographer, [[James Atlas]], "Delmore continued to hope that he would eventually receive his legacy [even] as late as 1946."<ref name="Atlas, James 1977">{{cite book |first=James |last=Atlas |title=Delmore Schwartz: The Life of An American Poet |location=New York |publisher=Farrar, Straus, Giroux |year=1977 |page=[https://archive.org/details/delmoreschwartzl00atla/page/32 32] |isbn=978-0374137618 |url=https://archive.org/details/delmoreschwartzl00atla/page/32 }}</ref>

Schwartz spent time at [[Columbia University]] and the [[University of Wisconsin]] before graduating with a [[B.A.]] from [[New York University]] in 1935. He then did some graduate work in philosophy at [[Harvard University]], where he studied with the philosopher [[Alfred North Whitehead]], but left and returned to New York without receiving a degree.<ref name="Atlas, James 1977"/>

In 1937, he married Gertrude Buckman, a book reviewer for ''Partisan Review'', whom he divorced after six years.

==Career in writing==
Soon thereafter, he made his parents' disastrous marriage the subject of his most famous short story, "[[In Dreams Begin Responsibilities]]", which was published in 1937 in the first issue of ''[[Partisan Review]]''.<ref>{{cite book |first2=Irving |last2=Howe |chapter=Foreword |first1=Delmore |last1=Schwartz |title=In Dreams Begin Responsibilities and Other Stories |url=https://archive.org/details/indreamsbeginres00schw |url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=New Directions |year=1978 |page=vii |isbn=978-0811206808}}</ref> This story and other short stories and poems became his first book, also titled ''In Dreams Begin Responsibilities'', published in 1938 when Schwartz was only 25 years old. The book was well received, and made him a well-known figure in New York intellectual circles. His work received praise from some of the most respected people in literature, including [[T. S. Eliot]], [[William Carlos Williams]], and [[Ezra Pound]], and Schwartz was considered one of the most gifted and promising young writers of his generation.<ref>[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/features/audioitem/2504?id=2504&page=2 Poetry Foundation Podcast]</ref> According to James Atlas, [[Allen Tate]] responded to the book by stating that "[Schwartz's] poetic style marked 'the first real innovation we've had since [[T.S. Eliot|Eliot]] and [[Ezra Pound|Pound]].'"<ref>{{cite book |first2=James |last2=Atlas |first1=Delmore |last1=Schwartz |chapter=Introduction |title=In Dreams Begin Responsibilities and Other Stories |url=https://archive.org/details/indreamsbeginres00schw |url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=New Directions |year=1978 |isbn=978-0811206808}}</ref>

For the next couple of decades, he continued to publish stories, poems, plays, and essays, and edited the ''Partisan Review'' from 1943 to 1955, as well as ''[[The New Republic]]''. Schwartz was deeply upset when his epic poem, ''Genesis'', which he published in 1943 and hoped would stand alongside other Modernist epics like ''[[The Waste Land]]'' and ''[[The Cantos]]'' as a masterpiece, received a negative critical response.<ref name="Atlas, James 1977"/> Later, in 1948, he married the novelist, Elizabeth Pollet. This relationship also ended in divorce.

In 1959, he became the youngest-ever recipient of the [[Bollingen Prize]], awarded for a collection of poetry he published that year, ''Summer Knowledge: New and Selected Poems''. His poetry differed from his stories in that it was less autobiographical and more philosophical. His verse also became increasingly abstract in his later years. He taught creative writing at six universities, including [[Syracuse University|Syracuse]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], and [[Kenyon College]].

A manifold honey to smear his face,   
Clumsy and lumbering here and there,   
The central ton of every place,   
The hungry beating brutish one   
In love with candy, anger, and sleep,   
Crazy factotum, dishevelling all,   
Climbs the building, kicks the football,   
Boxes his brother in the hate-ridden city.</poem>

In addition to being known as a gifted writer, Schwartz was considered a great conversationalist and spent much time entertaining friends at the [[White Horse Tavern (New York City)|White Horse Tavern]] in New York City.

Much of Schwartz's work is notable for its  philosophical and deeply meditative nature, and the literary critic, R.W. Flint, wrote that Schwartz's stories were "the definitive portrait of the Jewish middle class in New York during [[the Depression]]."<ref>R. W. Flint, "The Stories of Delmore Schwartz", ''Commentary'', April 1962.</ref> In particular, Schwartz emphasized the large divide that existed between his generation (which came of age during the Depression) and his parents' generation (who had often come to the United States as first-generation immigrants and whose idealistic view of America differed greatly from his own). In another take on Schwartz's fiction, Morris Dickstein wrote that "Schwartz’s best stories are either poker-faced satirical takes on the bohemians and outright failures of his generation, as in 'The World Is a Wedding' and 'New Year’s Eve,' or chronicles of the distressed lives of his parents’ generation, for whom the promise of American life has not panned out."<ref>{{cite journal |last=Dickstein |first=Morris |title=Growing Pains: Delmore Schwartz, Forgotten Genius |journal=Tablet Magazine |date=11 August 2011 |access-date=May 15, 2014 |url=http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/74715/growing-pains}}</ref>

A selection of his short stories was published posthumously in 1978 under the title ''In Dreams Begin Responsibilities and Other Stories'' and was edited by [[James Atlas]] who had written a biography of Schwartz, ''Delmore Schwartz: The Life of An American Poet'', two years earlier. Later, another collection of Schwartz's work, ''Screeno: Stories & Poems'', was published in 2004. This collection contained fewer stories than ''In Dreams Begin Responsibilities and Other Stories'' but it also included a selection of some of Schwartz's best-known poems like "The Heavy Bear Who Goes With Me" and "In The Naked Bed, In Plato's Cave". ''Screeno'' also featured an introduction by the fiction writer and essayist, [[Cynthia Ozick]].

==Death==
Schwartz was unable to repeat or build on his early successes later in life as a result of alcoholism and mental illness, and his last years were spent in seclusion at the [[Hotel Chelsea|Chelsea Hotel]] in New York. In fact, Schwartz was so isolated from the rest of the world that when he died in his hotel room on July 11, 1966, at age 52, of a heart attack, two days passed before his body was identified at the morgue.<ref name="Atlas, James 1977"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-heavy-bear-on-delmore-schwartz|title=The Heavy Bear: On Delmore Schwartz}}</ref>

Schwartz was interred at [[Cedar Park Cemetery, Emerson, New Jersey|Cedar Park Cemetery]], in [[Emerson, New Jersey]].<ref name=nyt1>{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Strauss |title= Sometimes the Grave Is a Fine and Public Place |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/28/nyregion/sometimes-the-grave-is-a-fine-and-public-place.html |newspaper=New York Times |date=March 28, 2004}}</ref>

==Tributes==

One of the earliest tributes to Schwartz came from Schwartz's friend, fellow poet [[Robert Lowell]], who published the poem "To Delmore Schwartz" in 1959 (while Schwartz was still alive) in the book ''[[Life Studies]]''. In it, Lowell reminisces about the time that the two poets lived together in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1946, writing that they were "underseas fellows, nobly mad, / we talked away our friends."<ref>Robert Lowell, ''Collected Poems''. New York: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 2003.</ref>

Schwartz's former student at Syracuse University, [[Lou Reed]], was the singer and principal songwriter for the band the [[Velvet Underground]]. Wanting to dedicate a song to Schwartz on their debut album, ''[[The Velvet Underground and Nico]]'', Reed chose "[[European Son]]" as it had the fewest lyrics; rock and roll lyrics were something Schwartz abhorred.<ref name="33 1/3">{{cite book |last=Harvard |first=Joe |title=''The Velvet Underground & Nico'' |orig-year=2004 |series=[[33⅓]] |year=2007 |publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]] |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-8264-1550-9 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/velvetundergroun00harv/page/132 132 / 136] |url=https://archive.org/details/velvetundergroun00harv/page/132 }}</ref> The song was recorded in April 1966, three months before Schwartz's death, but was not released until March 1967. According to musicologist [[Richard Witts]], the song "reads like little more than a song of loathing" toward Schwartz, who refused to see Reed while living at the Chelsea Hotel.<ref>{{cite book|last=Witts|first=Richard|author-link=Richard Witts|year=2006|title=The Velvet Underground|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|isbn=0253218322|page=63}}</ref> The first pressing of ''The Velvet Underground & Nico'' referred to the song as "European Son (to Delmore Schwartz)".<ref>{{cite book |editor= Clinton Heylin |title= All Yesterday's Parties: The Velvet Underground in Print 1966-1971 |edition= first |year= 2005 |publisher= [[Da Capo Press]] |location= [[United States]] |isbn= 0-306-81477-3 |pages= [https://archive.org/details/allyesterdayspar00heyl/page/200 200, 251] |url= https://archive.org/details/allyesterdayspar00heyl/page/200 }}</ref>

Lou Reed's 1982 solo album ''[[The Blue Mask]]'' includes his second Schwartz homage with the song "My House". A more direct tribute to Schwartz than the Velvet Underground's "European Son", the lyrics of "My House" are about Reed's relationship with Schwartz. In the song, Reed writes that Schwartz "was the first great man that I ever met".<ref>Reed, Lou. "My House." ''The Blue Mask''. RCA: 1982.</ref>

In the June 2012 issue of ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'' magazine, Lou Reed published a short prose tribute to Schwartz entitled "O Delmore How I Miss You."<ref>[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/article/244148 Reed, Lou. "O Delmore How I Miss You." Poetry: June 2012]</ref> In the piece, Reed quotes and references a number of Schwartz's short stories and poems including "In Dreams Begin Responsibilities," "The World is a Wedding," and "The Heavy Bear Who Goes With Me." "O Delmore How I Miss You" was re-published as the preface to the New Directions 2012 reissue of Schwartz's posthumously published story collection ''In Dreams Begin Responsibilities and Other Stories''.<ref>Marmer, Jake.

Another musician to pay tribute to Schwartz is [[Bono]], the lead singer of the Irish rock band [[U2]], who was inspired by the poet's work when writing the lyrics of U2's "[[Acrobat (U2 song)|Acrobat]]". The song, from the band's 1991 album ''[[Achtung Baby]]'', is dedicated to the poet and in its final verse is quoted the title of his book ''In Dreams Begin Responsibilities''.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Rock and Roll Should Be This Big! |url=http://www.atu2.com/news/rock-and-roll-should-be-this-big.html |journal=[[NME]] |first=Stuart |last=Bailie |date=13 June 1992|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305030428/http://www.atu2.com/news/rock-and-roll-should-be-this-big.html |archive-date=2016-03-05 }}</ref><ref>U2 (1991).

In 1968, Schwartz's friend and peer, fellow poet [[John Berryman]], dedicated his book ''[[The Dream Songs|His Toy, His Dream, His Rest]]'' "to the sacred memory of Delmore Schwartz," including 12 elegiac poems about Schwartz in the book. In "Dream Song #149," Berryman wrote of Schwartz, <blockquote> In the brightness of his promise,<br/>unstained, I saw him thro' the mist of the actual<br/>blazing with insight, warm with gossip<br/>thro' all our [[Harvard]] years<br/>when both of us were just becoming known<br/>I got him out of a police-station once, in Washington, the world is [[tref]]<br/>and grief too astray for tears.<ref>John Berryman, "Dream Song #149" in ''His Toy, His Dream, His Rest''. New York: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 1968.</ref> </blockquote>

The most ambitious literary tribute to Schwartz came in 1975, when [[Saul Bellow]], a one-time protégé of Schwartz, published his Pulitzer Prize-winning novel ''[[Humboldt's Gift]]'' which was based on his relationship with Schwartz. Although the character of Von Humboldt Fleischer is Bellow's portrait of Schwartz during Schwartz's declining years, the book is actually a testament to Schwartz's lasting artistic influence on Bellow. Although he is a genius, the Fleischer/Schwartz character struggles financially and has trouble finding a secure university teaching position. He becomes increasingly paranoid and jealous of the success of the main character, Charlie Citrine (who is based upon Bellow himself), becoming isolated and descending into alcoholism and madness.

[[Charles Bukowski]] wrote a biographical poem about Schwartz, published in his posthumous ''Open All Night''.  He characterized Schwartz's writing:

<blockquote>
his criticism was brilliant in its rancor and decisiveness;<br/>
he was really more of a bitch than a bard-<br/>
his poetry too fawning and delicate.<br/>
as a critic he was a good surgeon,<br/>
as a poet he was stalled in a kind of stale whimsy.<br/><ref>Charles Bukowski, "in dreams begin responsibilities." Collected in ''Open All Night'', Ecco Press, New York, 2002.</ref></blockquote>

In 1996, [[Donald Margulies]] wrote the play ''[[Collected Stories (play)|Collected Stories]],'' in which an aging writer and teacher reveals to a young student that she once had a great affair in her youth with Schwartz in [[Greenwich Village]]  while Schwartz was in declining health from alcoholism and mental illness. The student then controversially uses the affair revelation as the basis for a successful novel. The play was produced twice off-Broadway and once on Broadway.<ref>[http://theater.nytimes.com/2010/04/29/theater/reviews/29collected.html ''New York Times'' review of ''Collected Stories'']</ref>

In John A. McDermott's poetry collection, ''The Idea of God in Tennessee'', he includes a poem written for and referencing Schwartz, titled ''The Poet's Body, Unclaimed in the Manhattan Morgue''. The poem makes mention of Schwartz's writing, daily habits, and death.

A play by Romulus Linney about Schwartz's friendship with Milton Klonsky, Schwartz's protege and friend and a writer of nonfiction, was presented at Ensemble Theater Company in New York City in November and December 2005, and at The Redhouse Theatre in Syracuse, NY, during its 2004/05 season.
