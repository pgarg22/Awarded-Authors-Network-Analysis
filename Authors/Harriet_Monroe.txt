'''Harriet Monroe''' (December 23, 1860 – September 26, 1936) was an American editor, scholar, literary critic, poet, and patron of the arts.  She was the founding publisher and long-time editor of ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'' magazine, first published in 1912.  As a supporter of the poets [[Wallace Stevens]], [[Ezra Pound]], [[H. D.]], [[T. S. Eliot]], [[William Carlos Williams]], [[Carl Sandburg]], [[Max Michelson]] and others, Monroe played an important role in the development of modern poetry. Her correspondence with early twentieth century poets provides a wealth of information on their thoughts and motives.

==Biography==
[[File:Poetry cover1.jpg|thumb]]
Monroe was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]].  She read at an early age; her father had a large library that provided refuge from domestic discord.<ref name=poetryfoundation>{{cite web|title=Harriet Monroe: 1860–1936|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/harriet-monroe|publisher=Poetry Foundation|access-date=22 June 2012}}</ref>  In her autobiography, ''[[A Poet's Life: Seventy Years in a Changing World]]'', published two years after her death, Monroe recalls: "I started in early with Shakespeare, Byron, Shelley, with Dickens and Thackeray; and always the book-lined library gave me a friendly assurance of companionship with lively and interesting people, gave me friends of the spirit to ease my loneliness."<ref name=poetslife>{{cite book|last=Monroe|first=Harriet|title=A Poet's Life: Seventy Years in a Changing World|year=1938|publisher=Macmillan|location=New York}}</ref>

==Career==
Monroe graduated from the [[Georgetown Visitation Preparatory School|Visitation Academy]] of [[Georgetown, D.C.]], in 1879. She was later recognized as a very talented author for her age. Her prose piece published in 1899 in the [[Atlantic Monthly]], The ''Grand Canyon of the Colorado'',<ref>''The Grand Canyon Reader'' by Eugene Reader, {{ISBN|9780520270794}}</ref>  was considered better poetry than her most notable poem,<ref>Lovett, Robert Morrs, Review of [[''A Poet's Life: Seventy Years in a Changing World'']] Poetry Vol 52 no 1 April 1, 1938</ref> ''I love my life''.<ref>Love Song no 254''  ''The New Poetry Anthology'', 1957 [http://www.bartleby.com/265/254.html Love Song 254 ]</ref>

Driven by fears of posthumous anonymity, she proclaimed after graduation her determination to become "great and famous" as a poet or playwright. In the ''[[Dictionary of Literary Biography]]'', Judith Paterson quoted her as saying, "I cannot remember when to die without leaving some memorable record did not seem to me a calamity too terrible to be borne."<ref name=paterson>{{cite book|last=Paterson|first=Judith|title="Harriet Monroe," in Dictionary of Literary Biography: American Magazine Journalists, 1900-1960|year=1990|publisher=Gale|location=Detroit|isbn=0810345714|pages=[https://archive.org/details/americanmagazine00samg/page/226 226–234]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/americanmagazine00samg/page/226}}</ref>  She afterward devoted herself to literary work. Monroe in her biography said, 'I have sense of consecration that made me think I would prefer art to life'.<ref>Monroe, Harriet, ''A Poet's Life: Seventy Years in a Changing World'', Macmillan And Co,  New York, 1938</ref>

Though ''[[The Century Magazine|Century]]'' magazine published her poem, "With a Copy of Shelley," in 1889, she became disillusioned by the limited earnings available for poets, saying: "The minor painter or sculptor was honored with large annual awards in our greatest cities, while the minor poet was a joke of the paragraphers, subject to the popular prejudice that his art thrived best on starvation in a garret."<ref name=paterson /> She became a freelance correspondent to the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', and was commissioned to write a commemorative ode for the 400th anniversary of Columbus's discovery of America.<ref name=poetryfoundation />
 
Her financial hardships were alleviated after she sued the [[New York World]] for publishing the Colombian ode poem without her consent and she was awarded $5,000 in a settlement.<ref name=poetryfoundation />
With help from publisher [[Hobart Chatfield-Taylor]], Monroe convinced one hundred prominent Chicago business leaders to sponsor the magazine ''Poetry'' by each committing to fifty dollars for a five-year subscription. The $5,000, coupled with her own settlement, was enough to launch the magazine on September 23, 1912, while upholding its promise to contributors of adequate payment for all published work.<ref name=poetryfoundation /> Monroe was editor for its first two years without salary, while simultaneously working as an art critic for the ''Chicago Tribune''. By 1914, the magazine work became too much for her to accomplish while working other jobs, so she resigned from the ''Tribune'' and accepted a salary of fifty dollars per month from the magazine. For more than ten years she maintained herself on this stipend, raising it to one hundred dollars per month in 1925.<ref name=poetryfoundation />  Her extensive papers and correspondence as editor of ''Poetry'' magazine, illuminate the authorial process and the birth of modern poetry.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Poetry Magazine Exhibition - The University of Chicago Library |url=https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/collex/exhibits/poetry-magazine-gallery-voices/ |access-date=2021-09-02 |website=www.lib.uchicago.edu}}</ref>

[[Don Share]], who became editor of ''Poetry'' in 2013, writes that Monroe seemed to have a "sixth sense" about the poetry she published.  Monroe, herself, wrote and preferred poems rooted in 19th century tradition, but in her magazine, "that countervailing sixth sense allowed her to make literary history. She invented a box, you could say — and promptly set to work thinking outside it. Her magazine was, therefore, like she was: unpredictable, difficult, and infuriating,"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/article/246540#article|title=To Our Readers|author=Don Share|date=October 1, 2013|website=Poetry Foundation|access-date=8 October 2017}}</ref> but she never wavered in her assessment of progressive American culture as a democratic triumph.<ref>Schultze, Robin G, 'Legacy' Vol 21, no 1 2004</ref>

She continued editing the magazine until she died in [[Arequipa]], [[Peru]], at age 75, while on her way to climb [[Machu Picchu]]. The high altitudes reportedly triggered a [[cerebral hemorrhage]], which caused her death.<ref name=pfoundation>{{cite web|title=History - Poetry Magazine|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/history.html|publisher=Poetry Foundation|access-date=22 June 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127050859/http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/history.html|archive-date=27 January 2012}}</ref>

Monroe was a member of the [[Eagle's Nest Art Colony]] in [[Ogle County, Illinois]], and is mentioned in [[Erik Larson (author)|Erik Larson]]'s ''[[The Devil in the White City]]''.  In 2011, Monroe was inducted into the Chicago Literary Hall of Fame.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://chicagoliteraryhof.org/inductees/profile/harriet-monroe |title=Harriet Monroe |date=2011 |website=Chicago Literary Hall of Fame |language=en |access-date=2017-10-08}}</ref>
