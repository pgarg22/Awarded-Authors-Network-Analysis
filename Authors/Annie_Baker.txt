==Style==
''[[Time Out New York]]'' wrote in 2008 that Baker "creates normal individuals coping with everyday issues in their small-town lives," and that her play ''[[Body Awareness]]'' "marks the arrival of a new playwright who would seem to fit the quirky bill, but aims for sincerity instead. Even though there's goofiness aplenty in her work, [she] sticks to straightforward narrative and simple dialogue. The writing isn't superficially clever, it's smart."<ref>{{cite news| last=Cooper|first= Amanda| url = http://www.timeout.com/newyork/articles/theater/29926/lets-get-physical |title=Let's Get Physical| work=[[Time Out New York]]| date=May 28, 2008}}</ref> ''[[The New Yorker]]'' said Baker "wants life onstage to be so vivid, natural, and emotionally precise that it bleeds into the audience’s visceral experience of time and space.

Baker’s works are not for those who want easy, A-leads-to-B plots, and spoon-fed meanings...
