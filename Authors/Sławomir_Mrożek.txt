'''Sławomir Mrożek''' (29 June 1930 – 15 August 2013) was a [[Poles|Polish]] dramatist, writer and [[cartoonist]]. 

Mrożek joined the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] during the reign of [[Stalinism]] in the [[People's Republic of Poland]], and made a living as a political journalist. He began writing plays in the late 1950s. His theatrical works belong to the genre of [[absurdist fiction]], intended to shock the audience with non-realistic elements, political and historic references, distortion, and [[parody]].<ref name="britannica.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/395602/Slawomir-Mrozek|title= Sławomir Mrożek, from theEncyclopædia Britannica|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}</ref>

In 1963 he emigrated to Italy and France, then further to [[Mexico]]. In 1996 he returned to [[Poland]] and settled in [[Kraków]]. In 2008 he moved back to France.<ref name="culture.pl">Krystyna Dąbrowska, [https://culture.pl/en/artist/slawomir-mrozek Sławomir Mrożek.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121229165159/http://www.culture.pl/web/english/resources-visual-arts-full-page/-/eo_event_asset_publisher/eAN5/content/slawomir-mrozek |date=29 December 2012}} Culture.pl, September 2009.</ref> He died in [[Nice]] at the age of 83.<ref name="Mrozek_nie_zyje">{{cite news |url=http://wyborcza.pl/1,75478,14443110,Slawomir_Mrozek_nie_zyje.html |title=Sławomir Mrożek nie żyje |newspaper=[[Gazeta Wyborcza]] |date=15 August 2013 |access-date=15 August 2013 |author=Staff writer |language=pl}}</ref>

==Postwar period==
Mrożek's family lived in [[Kraków]] during World War II. He finished high school in 1949 and in 1950 debuted as a political [[hack-writer]] on ''[[Przekrój]]''. In 1952 he moved into the government-run Writer's House ([[Polish Writers' Union|ZLP]] headquarters with the restricted canteen).<ref name="readingmalopolska">{{cite web |url=http://readingmalopolska.pl/en/miasta-w-szlakach,31,krakow,481.chtm |title=Sławomir Mrożek trail |publisher=Literacka Małopolska |work=Malopolska Regional Operational Programme ERDF |year=2013 |access-date=5 March 2013 |quote=Legend with collection of links.

He participated in the defamation of Catholic priests from Kraków, three of whom were condemned to death by the Communist government in February 1953 after being groundlessly accused of treason (see the [[Stalinist show trial of the Kraków Curia]]).

His first wife, Maria Obremba, died in 1969. In 1987 he married Susana Osorio-Mrozek, a Mexican woman. In 1996, he relocated back to Poland and settled in Kraków.

Not a religious person by any means, on 17 September 2013 he was buried at the St. Peter and Paul Church in Kraków.

==Literary career==
[[File:Ilustration by Daniel Mróz 1957.png|thumb|200px|Daniel Mróz illustration for Mrożek's 1957 book ''Słoń'' (The Elephant)]] 
Mrożek's first play, ''[[The Police (play)|The Police]]'', was published in 1958. His first full-length play, ''[[Tango (play)|Tango]]'' (1965) written about [[totalitarianism]] in the style of [[Theatre of the Absurd]], made him, according to Krystyna Dąbrowska, one of the most recognizable Polish contemporary dramatists in the world.<ref name="culture.pl" /> It became also Mrożek's most successful play, according to [[Britannica]], produced in many Western countries.<ref name="britannica.com" /> In 1975 his second popular play ''Emigranci'' (The Émigrés),<ref name="e-teatr.pl">August Grodzicki, [http://www.e-teatr.pl/pl/artykuly/111842.html  "Bardzo polska tragikomedia."] ''Życie Warszawy'' nr 5; 7 Jan 1976</ref> a bitter and ironic portrait of two Polish emigrants in Paris, was produced by director [[Andrzej Wajda]] at the ''Teatr Stary'' in Kraków.<ref>[http://polinst.hu/en/node/4523  Sławomir Mrożek literary evening in the Polish Institute], 27 February 2007, ''Lengyel Intézet'', Budapest.</ref> Mrożek traveled to France, England, Italy, Yugoslavia and other European countries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/mrozek.htm |title=Sławomir Mrożek |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824093548/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/mrozek.htm |archive-date=24 August 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref> After the [[Martial law in Poland|military crackdown of 1981]] Mrożek wrote the only play he ever regretted writing, called ''Alfa'', about the imprisoned [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] leader [[Lech Wałęsa]] who became [[President of Poland]] after the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse of the Soviet empire]].

Niemczyńska |language=pl}}</ref> After the introduction of [[martial law in Poland]], productions of Alfa were banned, along with two of Mrożek's other plays, The Ambassador and [[Vatzlav]].<ref name="culture.pl-mrozek"/> The later play, in [[Gdańsk]], in the city known as the birth and home to [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)]] and its leader [[Lech Walesa]], Theater Wybrzeze courageously premiered "[[Vatzlav]]". These were the times that the country had food shortages, curfews and a police hour. Many actors were interned including actor Jerzy Kiszkis who played the title role of "[[Vatzlav]]". A [[Gdańsk]] born actress, activist and [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] [[History of Solidarity|''Solidarność'' (Solidarity)]]supporter [[Beata Pozniak]], was asked to play Justine, a character that symbolized [[justice]]. [[Censorship]] in theaters were enforced. It was noted that in this 1982 Gdańsk production, the censor stopped Mrozek's play not allowing many gestures made by actors on stage, including Justine's father wearing a beard, because he reminded her too much of [[Karl Marx]]. (Reference: https://www.huffpost.com/entry/world-theatre-day_b_9548710) It was not without reason that Mrozek's plays were often classified as absurd, since the times that everyone lived in were often referred to as absurd.
