==Life==
Kambar was born in [[Therazhundur, Thanjavur district]] and brought up in the household of a wealthy farmer named Sadaiyepa Vallal in [[Thiruvennainallur|Vennai Nellur]] in [[Tamil Nadu]].<ref>India's Communities by Kumar Suresh Singh, Anthropological Survey of India – Ethnology – 1992 – 4146 pages</ref>{{full citation needed|date=May 2019}} The [[Legendary early Chola kings|Chola king]]—having heard of this talented bard—summoned him to his court and honoured him with the title ''Kavi Chakravarty'' (''The Emperor of Poets'').<ref name="The Cyclopaedia of India and of Eastern and Southern Asia"/>{{full citation needed|date=May 2019}}

Kambar flourished in [[Therazhundur]], a village in the culturally rich [[Nagapattinam District]] in the modern state of Tamil Nadu in South India.

Kambar is generally dated after the [[vaishnavite]] philosopher, [[Ramanuja]], as the poet refers to the latter in his work, the Sadagopar Andhadhi.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian Or South-Indian Family of Languages|year=1875|url=https://archive.org/details/comparativegramm00caldrich|author=Robert Caldwell|publisher=Trübner, 1875|page=[https://archive.org/details/comparativegramm00caldrich/page/136 136]}}</ref>

Kamban was a great scholar of both [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]—two of India's oldest and richest languages in terms of literary works. In a scholarly biography, ''Kavichakravarty Kamban'', [[Mahavidwan R. Raghava Iyengar]] wrote in detail about Kambar.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

Kambar spent his last days in [[Nattarasankottai]] (known for Kannathal temple) near to [[Sivagangai]] town and his tomb is situated there. It is said that Kambar after having differences with the Chola king, left the Chola kingdom and moved from place to place. When he reached at Nattarasankottai, he was very thirsty and asked water in one house at Nattarasankottai. He was offered buttermilk in return and he became very happy and decided to stay there itself and spent his last days there. He lived there till his death. There is tomb in Nattarasankottai and every year a celebration called ''Kamban vizha'' is conducted at this place to felicitate Kambar.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

The original version of ''Ramayana'' was written by [[Valmiki]]. It is an epic of 24,000 verses which depicts the journey of [[Rama]], a prince of [[Ayodhya]] who belonged to [[Raghuvamsa (dynasty)|Raghuvamsa]] (Solar dynasty). In [[Hinduism]], Rama is the seventh [[Avatar|incarnation]] of Lord [[Vishnu]], one of the [[Trimurti]] (the Hindu holy trinity which includes [[Brahma (god)|Brahma]] and [[Shiva]]).

''Kamba Ramayana'' is not a verbal translation of the Sanskrit epic by Valmiki, but a retelling of the story of Lord Rama.<ref name="Rays and Ways of Indian Culture"/>{{full citation needed|date=May 2019}}

Legend has it that the entire episode was written in one night by Lord [[Ganesha|Ganesh]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Ganesha is said{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} to have written the poems that Kambar dictated to him during the night, as Kambar procrastinated the work till the day before the deadline set by the King.

''Kamba Ramayana'' was first delivered in [[Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple, Srirangam]] at the court hall (Kambar Arangetra Mandapam) near Thaayar sannithi.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

Legend says that when contemporaries objected to ''Hiranyavadaipadalam'' ("Story of [[Hiranyakasipu]]", which occurs as [[Vibhishana]] telling Ravana while warning against his false sense of invincibility), Kamban read it in front of the [[Narasimha]] Swami temple in Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple. The Swami applauded by laughing out aloud from his Sanctum Sanctora (Mettu Narasimhar Sannidhi), and this was taken as proof of approval.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

==Kambar's praise==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}
{{Hindu scriptures}}
Many Tamil poets, statesmen, kings, and common people have praised Kambar for his ''Kambaramayanam'', which has more than 10,000 songs and 45,000 lines, forming one of the greatest of Tamil epics.

A common word of praise attributed to Kambar is that even the mill in his house would sing ("Kambar veettuk kattuththariyum kavipadum"; "கம்பர் வீட்டுக் கட்டுத்தறியும் 
கவி பாடும்"). He is considered special in singing poems under "Viruthapa".

"Kamba Sutram" (கம்ப சூத்திரம்) is a phrase used by Tamil people in their day-to-day activity. It was originally "Kamba Chithiram", denoting Kamban's art. However, over a period of time, it came to be rendered as "Kamba Sutram". The phrase is used just like "rocket science", which clearly denotes that skills of Kambar in writing poem with viruthapa is as difficult as "rocket science".
