Staveley's debut trilogy, ''The Chronicles of the Unhewn Throne'' (2014–2016), follows the three children of an assassinated emperor – the monk Kaden, the special forces soldier Valyn and the politician Adare – as they attempt to unravel the conspiracy gripping their continent-spanning empire.

===''Skullsworn''===
The first of a projected series of standalone novels about secondary characters in the ''Chronicles'', Staveley's 2017 novel ''Skullsworn'' is set several years prior to the events of the trilogy. It sees the apprentice assassin Pyrre returning to her home city where she is to kill seven people – including one whom she loves – in order to become a priestess of the god of death.

Reviewing ''Skullsworn'' at ''Tor.com'', Laura M. Hughes described its setting, the swampy river delta city of Dombâng, as the novel's "show-stealer" antagonist, and appreciated Staveley's "more confident, assured" narrative voice.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hughes|first1=Laura M.|title=Deadly Peril Done Right: Brian Staveley’s Skullsworn|url=http://www.tor.com/2017/04/28/book-reviews-brian-staveley-skullsworn/|work=Tor.com|date=28 April 2017}}</ref> ''Kirkus Reviews'' described it as "a pleasantly grim and emotionally complex ''divertissement''",<ref>{{cite news|title=SKULLSWORN by Brian Staveley|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/brian-staveley/skullsworn/|accessdate=25 June 2017|work=Kirkus Reviews|date=21 February 2017|language=en-us}}</ref> and ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' noted the "remarkably intimate" novel's "visceral action scenes and memorable characters".<ref>{{cite news|title=Fiction Book Review: Skullsworn by Brian Staveley|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-7653-8987-9|accessdate=25 June 2017|work=PublishersWeekly.com|date=27 February 2017|language=en}}</ref>
