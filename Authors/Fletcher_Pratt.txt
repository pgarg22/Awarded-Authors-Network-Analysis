'''Murray Fletcher Pratt''' (25 April 1897 – 10 June 1956) was an [[American people|American]] [[List of science fiction authors|writer]] of history, [[science fiction]], and [[fantasy]]. He is best known for his works on [[naval history]] and the [[American Civil War]] and for fiction written with [[L. Sprague de Camp]].

== Life and work ==
[[File:BSI-Pratt-Morley-Stout-1944.jpg|300px|left|thumb|Fletcher Pratt (left) with fellow [[The Baker Street Irregulars|Baker Street Irregulars]] [[Christopher Morley]] and [[Rex Stout]] (1944)]]
According to de Camp, Pratt was born near [[Tonawanda (town), New York|Tonawanda, New York]]. The son of Robert M. and Alice Horton Pratt, he attended public schools in Buffalo and graduated from high school in 1915 at the [[Springville-Griffith Institute Central School District|Griffith Institute]] in [[Springville, New York]], where his father operated a trucking delivery service between Springville and Buffalo.<ref>"Graduation Class of Forty Members", ''Springville Journal'', June 24, 1915, p.8.</ref><ref>"Lt. Commander Robert H. Pratt Dies", ''Springville Journal'', June 6, 1957, p.6.</ref>

Following high school he attended [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges|Hobart College]] in Geneva, New York for one year. In February 1916 the Associated Press reported that he had been arrested for burglary in Geneva after a series of midnight cash drawer robberies that allegedly netted him less than $25. He was reported to have told police that his father did not supply him with enough funds to survive at Hobart.<ref>"Accuse Springville Youth of Robbing Newspaper", ''Buffalo Courier'', Feb. 22, 1916, p.9. The Associated Press mistakenly identified Pratt as Murray S. Pratt, which was copied by every newspaper that covered the story.</ref> On February 23 the ''Buffalo Enquirer'' reported: "Pratt's father came on from Springville yesterday and it was practically decided to send the youth to the [[Willard Asylum for the Chronic Insane|State Hospital for the Insane at Willard]], pending an investigation of his case by the grand jury. It is thought that he may be mentally unsound."<ref>"May Send Hobart Collegian Away", ''Buffalo Enquirer'', Feb. 23, 1916, p.6.</ref>

In May 1918 the ''Washington Star'' reported that the staff at the camp library at the Army's Camp Meade in Maryland had been strengthened by the addition of "Murray F. Pratt, who recently came here from the Buffalo, N.Y., Public Library".<ref>"8,000 More Acres Planned For Meade", ''Washington Evening Star'', May 2, 1918, p.17.</ref>

After a stint at the ''[[Buffalo Courier-Express]]'' he settled in New York City in 1920 and worked for a [[Staten Island]] newspaper before turning to freelance writing in 1923.<ref>"Fletcher Pratt, Noted Author, Dies at 59", ''Atlantic Highlands Journal'', June 15, 1956, p. 2.</ref> In 1926, he married [[Inga Stephens Pratt Clark|Inga Stephens]], an artist.<ref> [https://books.google.com/books?id=5VyAhcR2LrUC&pg=PR4 Preface by David Madden to ''A Short History of the Civil War: Ordeal by Fire'' by Fletcher Pratt].</ref> According to de Camp she was his second wife. In the late 1920s he began selling stories to [[pulp magazines]], primarily the science fiction magazines published by [[Hugo Gernsback]]. Many of these stories were either written with a collaborator or were translations from French and German sources. 

When a fire gutted his apartment in the early 1930s, according to de Camp's memoir, he used the insurance money to study at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] for a year. After his return from France he was a staff writer for ''American Detective'', a true crime magazine, and  began writing histories. His short history of the Civil War, ''Ordeal by Fire'', was published to critical acclaim in 1935 and became a bestseller.

[[File:Amazing stories 192805.jpg|thumb|right|Pratt's's novelette "The Octopus Cycle" was the cover story in the May 1928 ''[[Amazing Stories]]'']]
Starting in the summer of 1937 Pratt became a regular at the annual [[Bread Loaf Writers' Conference]] in Vermont for the next 18 years, eventually becoming their Dean of Nonfiction. 

During World War II Pratt was a military analyst for the ''[[New York Post]]'' and for [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine (whose obituary described him as "bearded, gnome-like" and listed "raising [[marmosets]]" among his hobbies),<ref>"[https://web.archive.org/web/20081214102035/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,862257,00.html "Milestones"], ''Time'', June 18, 1956</ref> and later was a regular reviewer of historical nonfiction and fantasy and science fiction for the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]''.

Following World War II the Pratts came into possession of a rambling 31-room Victorian mansion on a high bluff  overlooking the Atlantic Ocean at Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, purchased by Inga Stephens Pratt's wealthy mother for use as a summer place. Whimsically dubbed The Ipsy-Wipsy Institute, the house became a watering hole for Fletcher's literary friends at an unending succession of marathon weekend house parties. A number of writers moved into the mansion's many bedrooms and spent entire summers there. Frequent guests and residents at Ipsy-Wipsy included [[William Lindsay Gresham]], [[John Ciardi]], [[William Sloane (author)|William Sloane]], [[Basil Davenport]], [[Lester del Rey]], [[Ted Sturgeon]], Esther Carlson, [[Fred Pohl]], [[John Drury Clark|John D. 
Clark]], [[Willy Ley]], [[Judith Merrill]], [[Eugenie Clark]], [[L. Sprague de Camp]], and many others. [[Laurence Manning]], Pratt's old writing partner from the 1930s, purchased part of the property and moved in next door. The Pratts simultaneously maintained a large apartment in Midtown Manhattan near Central Park, where they hosted meetings of the [[Hydra Club]].

Pratt was the inventor of a set of rules for naval [[wargaming]], which he created before the [[Second World War]]. This was known as the [http://www.wargaming.co/recreation/details/fpnaval.htm "Fletcher Pratt Naval War Game"] and it involved dozens of tiny wooden ships, built on a scale of one inch to 50 feet. These were spread over the floor of Pratt's apartment and their strengths were calculated via a complex mathematical formula. Noted author and artist [[Jack Coggins]] was a frequent participant in Pratt's Navy Game, and de Camp met him through his wargaming group.<ref>For further details about the game, including much previously unpublished material, see the Fletcher Pratt Naval Wargame, published in 2011 by the History of Wargaming Project www.wargaming.co</ref>

Pratt established the literary dining club known as the [[Trap Door Spiders]] in 1944. The name is a reference to the exclusive habits of the trapdoor spider, which when it enters its burrow pulls the hatch shut behind it. The club was later fictionalized as the [[Black Widowers]] in a series of [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] stories by [[Isaac Asimov]]. Pratt himself was fictionalized in one story, "To the Barest", as the Widowers’ founder, Ralph Ottur.

He was also a charter member of [[Civil War Round Table|The Civil War Round Table of New York]], organized in 1951, and served as its president from 1953-1954. In 1956, after his death, the Round Table's board of directors established the Fletcher Pratt Award in his honor, which is presented every May to the author or editor of the best non-fiction book on the Civil War published during the preceding calendar year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cwrtnyc.org/fletcher-pratt-award.html |title=The Fletcher Pratt Award |publisher=[[Civil War Round Table]] |access-date=December 27, 2017}}</ref>

Aside from his historical writings, Pratt is best known for his fantasy collaborations with de Camp, the most famous of which is the humorous [[Harold Shea]] series, eventually published in full as ''[[The Complete Compleat Enchanter]]'' (1989, {{ISBN|0-671-69809-5}}). His solo fantasy novels ''[[The Well of the Unicorn]]'' and ''[[The Blue Star (novel)|The Blue Star]]'' are also highly regarded. Pratt's story "Dr. Grimshaw's Sanitarium" was adapted for radio drama by George Lefferts, and broadcast twice: first on ''[[Dimension X (radio program)|Dimension X]]'' ([[List_of_Dimension_X_episodes|September 22, 1950]]) and then on [[X Minus One]] ([[List_of_X_Minus_One_episodes|July 14, 1955]]). 

Pratt wrote in a markedly identifiable prose style, reminiscent of the style of [[Bernard DeVoto]]. One of his books is dedicated "To Benny DeVoto, who taught me to write."

Several of Pratt's books were illustrated by [[Inga Stephens Pratt Clark|Inga Stephens Pratt]], his wife.
