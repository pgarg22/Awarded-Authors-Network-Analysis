==Children's fiction==
Lively first achieved success with [[children's fiction]]. Her first book, ''Astercote'', was published by [[Heinemann (publisher)|Heinemann]] in 1970. It is a [[low fantasy]] novel set in a [[Cotswolds]] village and the neighbouring woodland site of a medieval village wiped out by [[Plague (disease)|Plague]].<ref name=Dame>{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Penelope-Lively |title=Dame Penelope Lively |publisher=britannica.com |access-date=10 January 2018}}</ref>

Lively published more than twenty books for children, achieving particular recognition with ''[[The Ghost of Thomas Kempe]]'' and ''[[A Stitch in Time (Lively novel)|A Stitch in Time]]''.<ref name=Dame/> For the former she won the 1973 [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] from the [[CILIP|Library Association]], recognising the year's best children's book by a [[British subject]].<ref name=medal1973/> For the latter she won the [[1976 Whitbread Awards|1976 Whitbread Children's Book Award]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.costabookawards.com/downloads/PastWinners.pdf |title=Costa Book Awards |date=2009-12-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229131124/http://www.costabookawards.com/downloads/PastWinners.pdf |archive-date=2009-12-29 |access-date=2019-06-26}}</ref> The three novels feature local history, roughly 600, 300, and 100 years past, in ways that approach [[time travel|time slip]] but do not posit travel to the past.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/penelope-lively-11/a-stitch-in-time-4/|title=A STITCH IN TIME by Penelope Lively {{!}} Kirkus Reviews|language=en}}</ref>

==Adult works==
Lively's first novel for adults, ''[[The Road to Lichfield]]'', was published in 1977 and made the shortlist for the [[Booker Prize]].<ref>[http://themanbookerprize.com/fiction/1977 The Man Booker Prize -fiction, 1977: The Shortlist: '...Peter Smart’s Confessions/ Great Granny Webster/ Shadows on our Skin/ The Road to Lichfield/ Quartet in Autumn'] at themanbookerprize.com, Accessed 15 April 2018</ref> She repeated the feat in 1984 with ''[[According to Mark]]'', and won the 1987 prize for ''[[Moon Tiger]]'', which tells the story of a woman's tempestuous life as she lies dying in a hospital bed. As with all of Lively's fiction, ''Moon Tiger'' is marked by a close attention to the power of memory, the impact of the past upon the present, and the tensions between "official" and personal histories. She explored the same themes more explicitly in her nonfiction works, including ''A House Unlocked'' (2001) and ''Oleander, Jacaranda: A Childhood Perceived'' (1994), a memoir of her Egyptian childhood. Her latest nonfiction work ''Ammonites & Leaping Fish: A Life in Time'', (latterly known as ''Dancing Fish and Ammonites: A Memoir'')<ref>[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18114275-dancing-fish-and-ammonites Dancing Fish and Ammonites: A Memoir] ''first published October 10th 2013; Original Title: Ammonites and Leaping Fish: A Life in Time'' at goodreads.com, Accessed 24 April 2018</ref> was published in 2013.

Beside novels and short stories, Lively has also written radio and television scripts, presented a radio programme, and contributed reviews and articles to various newspapers and journals.
