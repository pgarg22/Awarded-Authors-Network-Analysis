'''János Mattis-Teutsch''' or '''Máttis-Teutsch''', '''Mátis-Teutsch''' ({{IPA-all|ˈjaːnoʃ ˈmɒtːiʃ ˈtʰɔʏ̯t͡ʃ}}; the most common [[Hungarian language|Hungarian-language]] versions of his name, all of which have also been spelled without the hyphen; his first name has been rendered as ''Hans'' or ''Johannes'' in [[German language|German]] and ''Ioan'' in [[Romanian language|Romanian]]; 13 August 1884 &ndash; 17 March 1960) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] painter, sculptor, graphic artist, art critic, and poet. Best known for his ''[[Seelenblumen]]'' ("Soulflowers") cycle of paintings, he was an important contributor to the development of [[modern art]] and [[avant-garde]] trends inside Romania (where he spent the larger part of his life). He was the grandfather of the artist [[Waldemar Mattis-Teutsch]].

==Biography==
He was born in the [[Transylvania]]n city of [[Braşov|Brassó]] (Braşov), then part of the [[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen|Kingdom of Hungary]] within [[Austria-Hungary]], now part of Romania. He was the son of János Mátis, an [[Hungarian minority in Romania|ethnic Hungarian]] of [[Székelys|Székely]] origins, and his wife, the [[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxon]] Josefin Schneider.<ref>Mansbach; Murádin</ref> After Mátis died during his son's early years, Josefin married the Saxon Friedrich Teutsch, who adopted János.<ref name="Murádin">Murádin</ref> He completed primary school in Hungarian, and then attended the German-language Honterus Secondary School; between 1901 and 1903, he studied sculpture at the National Hungarian Royal School for Applied Arts in [[Budapest]], and then left for [[Munich]], where he attended the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich|Royal Academy of Fine Arts]], and [[Paris]] — during the period, Mattis-Teutsch appears to have moved from [[Art nouveau]] to [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]] and [[Fauvism|Fauvist]] themes, and eventually embraced ''[[Die Brücke]]'' and ''[[Der Blaue Reiter]]'' ideas.<ref>Franzke; Majoros; Murádin</ref>
He was also famous for his ''CHEEZBERGA'' painting.

Soon after his return from France in 1908, Mattis-Teutsch began teaching at the State Woodwork School, and replaced [[János Kupcsay]] as professor ("scholar master") in 1910.<ref name="Murádin"/> He married Gisella Borsos in 1909 (their wedding caused scandal, since she had broken off her engagement to someone else).<ref name="Murádin"/> A member of the artists' group known as the ''[[Sebastian Hann]] Verein'', keeping close contacts with local artists such as [[Friedrich Miess]], [[Gusztáv Kollár]], [[Gyula Tutschek]], [[Hermann Morres]], [[Fritz Kimmel]], and [[Hans Eder (Transylvanian Saxon artist)|Hans Eder]], he exhibited his first sculptures during a joint show in [[Pest (city)|Pest]] (1910), and then in a [[Gyula Vastagh]]-organized exhibit in his native town (1914).<ref>Grigorescu, p.128, 441; Murádin</ref>

He became an acquaintance of [[Lajos Kassák]], and published [[linocut]] drawings in the modern art magazine ''MA'' (''Tájkép fával'' – "Landscape with a Tree", 1917; ''Kompozíció két alakkal'' – "Composition with Two Figures", 1919),<ref>Grigorescu, p.441; Majoros; Mansbach; Passuth; Vida</ref> as well as contributing to the joint exhibits the latter organized, before being showcased in [[Vienna]] and establishing connections with [[Herwarth Walden]] and his [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] group around ''[[Der Sturm]]'' — eventually, he adopted the style, continuing to be directly influenced by the [[abstract art]] of [[Wassily Kandinsky]] and [[Kazimir Malevich]], and moving towards a non-figurative outlook.<ref>Drăguţ ''et al.'', p.260; Grigorescu, p.373, 389, 440, 441; Majoros; Murádin; Passuth; Vida</ref> His success was contrasted by an emotional crisis caused by the death of his wife in 1916; he remarried with Marie Conrad, an [[Austrians|Austrian]] woman, in 1919.<ref>Murádin; Vida</ref>

Present in [[Budapest]] at the time of the [[Aster Revolution]], Mattis-Teutsch probably witnessed first hand the establishment of the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]]; despite conflicting accounts and his [[Socialism|socialist]] creed, it seems that he was not involved in the pro-[[Bolshevik]] movement.<ref name="Murádin"/> He remained a committed [[anti-Fascism|anti-Fascist]], and later spoke out against the influence of [[Nazism]] inside the Transylvanian Saxon community (''see [[German Party (Romania)]]'').<ref name="Murádin"/>

He was present in Transylvania by mid-1919, and organized several exhibitions; as the region became part of the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Kingdom]] and, for a while, his teaching position was being reconsidered by the new authorities, he planned to relocate to Germany, before deciding to remain present in Romanian artistic life, and to regularly participate in art shows in [[Bucharest]] and throughout Transylvania.<ref name="Murádin"/> Active inside the ''[[Contimporanul]]'' group in Bucharest (with [[Victor Brauner]], [[M. H. Maxy]], and [[Marcel Janco]]) and with ''Das Ziel'' in Braşov,<ref>Grigorescu, p.389; Mansbach; Passuth; Vida</ref> Mattis-Teutsch was immediately hailed by modernist critics (including [[Nicolae Tonitza]], [[Otto Bratskoven]], [[Sigmund Maur]], [[Lucian Blaga]], [[Károly Kós]], [[Eugen Jebeleanu]], and [[Ernő Ligeti]]).<ref>Grigorescu, p.442; Murádin; Vida</ref> His works were presented at the 1924 international exhibition organized by ''Contimporanul'', alongside those of [[Kurt Schwitters]], [[Paul Klee]], [[Constantin Brâncuși]] (whom Mattis-Teutsch had already met in person),<ref>Franzke</ref> [[Hans Arp]], Janco, Brauner, and Maxy.

Later on, he returned to figurative art, an interest which he fused with his socialist beliefs in an attempt to create a socially-aware art (as defined by his ''Kunstideologie'', "Ideology of Painting", a magazine he edited in Braşov).<ref>Franzke; Majoros; Mansbach; Murádin</ref> After the ''Contimporanul'' moment, he joined the editorial staff of ''Integral'', and defined his new style, considered to be close to [[Surrealism]], as "constructive [[Realism (arts)|realism]]".<ref>Drăguţ ''et al.'', p.259-260; Grigorescu, p.440; Passuth</ref> Although he was among the painters who spent summers in [[Baia Mare]] (''see [[Baia Mare School]]''), Mattis-Teutsch never adapted his themes to the [[landscape art]] encouraged by the group, and remained mainly interested in social themes.<ref name="Murádin"/>

The 1933 death of his daughter and political factors caused him to cease work until the 1940s.<ref name="Majoros">Majoros</ref>  At the end of [[World War II]], with the onset of the [[Soviet occupation of Romania|Soviet occupation]] and, eventually, the establishment of the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]], his earlier work was subject to [[propaganda]] attacks while he attempted to adapt to the themes of [[Socialist realism]],<ref name="Murádin"/> creating portraits of [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Stakhanovite]] scenes featuring bricklayers and miners.<ref name="Majoros"/>
