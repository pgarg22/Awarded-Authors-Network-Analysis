'''Peter Robinson''' (born 18 February 1953, full name: Peter John Edgley Robinson) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[poet]] born in [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]], [[Lancashire]].

==Life and career==
Born in Hope Hospital, Salford, Lancashire, the first son of an Anglican curate and geography teacher, Peter Robinson spent his first three years in Pendlebury and Davyhulme. Taken to Litherland in 1956, he grew up, with the exception of five years spent in Wigan (1962-1967), in poor urban parishes of north and south [[Liverpool]]. Robinson graduated from the [[University of York]] in 1974. In the 1970s he edited the poetry magazine [http://jacketmagazine.com/20/pbi.html ''Perfect Bound'']. He helped organize several international [[Cambridge Poetry Festival]]s between 1977 and 1985, and was festival coordinator in 1979. He was awarded a doctorate from the University of Cambridge in 1981 for a thesis on the poetry of [[Donald Davie]], [[Roy Fisher]] and [[Charles Tomlinson]]. Among the most decisive events for his creative life, a sexual assault in Italy upon his girlfriend in 1975 — which he witnessed at gunpoint — formed the material for some of the poems in ''This Other Life'' (1988) and provided the plot outline for a novel called ''September in the Rain'' published in September 2016.

During the 1980s he was one of the organisers of the exhibition [[Pound's Artists|''Pound's Artists: Ezra Pound and the Visual Arts in London, Paris and Italy'']] at [[Kettle's Yard]] and the [[Tate Gallery]], co-edited the magazine [[Numbers (magazine)|''Numbers'']]<ref>

After teaching for the [[University of Wales, Aberystwyth]], and at the [[University of Cambridge]], he held various posts in [[Japan]]. His most extended employment, from 1991 to 2005, was teaching [[English Literature]] and [[English language|English]] as a second language at [[Tohoku University]] in [[Sendai, Miyagi|Sendai]]. He underwent a successful brain tumour operation in 1993 while his first marriage was failing. He remarried in 1995 to an educationalist and now has two daughters, Giulia and Matilde. In 2007 he returned to the UK to take up a post as Professor of English and American literature at the [[University of Reading]]. There he founded Creative Writing at Reading and collaborated in its development into a full joint degree programme with English Literature and a number of other arts subjects. He leads research on poetry and poetics, has organised a centenary conference on the work of the poet [[Bernard Spencer]] (1909–1963), instigated the publication of an annual creative arts anthology, and helped found the Reading Poetry Festival (2013-17). He is poetry editor for [[Two Rivers Press]] and literary executor for the estates of the poets [[Roy Fisher]] (1930–2017) and [[Mairi MacInnes]] (1925–2017).    

A regular contributor of book reviews and literary criticism to poetry magazines, academic journals, and newspapers, Peter Robinson has presented and discussed his work in many parts of the world, giving talks and readings in Chicago, Los Angeles and New York (USA), Hiroshima, Kobe, Kyoto, Tokyo, Sendai and elsewhere in Japan, Sofia (Bulgaria), Kristiansand (Norway), Prague (Czech Republic), Vienna (Austria), Milan, Parma, and Massa Marittima (Italy), Paris (France), Heidelberg (Germany), Nikšić (Montenegro), Elche and Moguer (Spain), Dublin and Limerick (Eire), and all over the United Kingdom. He has also taken part in a number of programmes on BBC Radio Berkshire, Cambridgeshire, Bristol, and Merseyside,  as well as on BBC Radio Three.

==Critical reception==

Peter Robinson's earliest published poetry was fortunate to receive numerous notices, including one in which the poet and novelist [[James Lasdun]] observed that ‘he ''is'' a poet, and one with a sensibility which, if attuned only to a somewhat limited range of experience, is unusually refined’ in ''Siting Fires'' 1 (1983). The best of these early reviews was Eric Griffiths’ in ''PN Review'' 35 (1983), which described Robinson as ‘in my judgement, the finest poet of his generation’. The publication of ''This Other Life'' (1988) brought his work to the attention of the national press for the first time with Martin Dodsworth in the ''Guardian'' (Friday 13 May 1988) describing the book as ‘grave and deliberated…beautiful and mysterious too’, Rachel Billington's singling it out in the ''Financial Times'' (20 Feb 1988), and its being named a ‘Book of the Year’ in the ''Sunday Telegraph'' (4 Dec 1988). Stephen Romer described it as ‘love poetry of an exemplary kind’ in the ''Times Literary Supplement'' (19 Aug 1988) and John Kerrigan found in it ‘a miracle of balance’ in the ''London Review of Books'' (13 Oct 1988).

Highlights of the subsequent decade were provided by [[John Ashbery]]’s characterizing his poetry, along with that of other younger writers, as ‘curiously strong’ in ''PN Review'' (1993), while  Peter Swaab, again in the ''TLS'' (4 Sept 1998) noted its ‘staying power’.  James Keery published the first attempt to articulate this evolving oeuvre's underlying themes in [http://www.carcanet.co.uk/cgi-bin/scribe?showdoc=342;doctype=review ‘Marred in a way you recognize’ in ''PN Review''] 126 (Mar-April 1999), and the first appreciation in a critical study came with Sumie Okada's ‘A Sense of Being Misplaced’, ''Western Writers in Japan''  (Basingstoke: Macmillan, 1999). Robinson's many years working in that country made it difficult for him to maintain a profile in the British poetry scene, but his work continued to receive attention, and the publication of his ''Selected Poems'' (2003) prompted a number of reviews including a welcome by Patrick McGuinness in the ''Poetry Review'' (Winter 2005), a review in ''The Japan Times'' (20 Oct 2003) by David Burleigh, and one in Romanian by [https://web.archive.org/web/20111006063925/http://www.sisif.ro/cartea%20de%20sub%20nas/524/Poezia-lui-Peter-Robinson-din-Selected-Poems:-1976-2001.html Catalin Ghita].

His current critical standing was underlined by the publication in 2007 of ''The Salt Companion to Peter Robinson'', a collection of fourteen essays with a bibliography (1976–2006), edited by Adam Piette and Katy Price. The volume includes a preface by [[Roy Fisher]] in which he observes: ‘Thus the life-events don’t provide the driving force of the poems; rather they make up the terrain, a varied surface across which the poet travels, living his life but always exercising a strong disposition to make poems from somewhere close to everyday events. It’s as if he carries a listening device, alert for the moments when the tectonic plates of mental experience slide quietly one beneath another to create paradoxes and complexities that call for poems to be made. These are not the ordinary urgencies of autobiography, but they are the urgencies of new creations’ (p.&nbsp;22).

More recent responses to Robinson's work are Ben Hickman's in [http://jacketmagazine.com/35/r-robinson-rb-hickman.shtml ''Jacket''], and Tom Phillips’ in [http://toddswift.blogspot.com/2008/04/guest-review-phillips-on-robinson.html ''Eyewear''], while Ian Brinton features his observations on the art in ''Contemporary Poetry: Poets and Poetry since 1990'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009). Reviewing ''The Returning Sky'' (a Poetry Book Society Recommendation for the Spring quarter) in the Autumn 2012 issue of ''Poetry Review'' (102/3), Todd Swift described its author as 'a major English poet.' His ''Collected Poems 1976-2016'' appeared in February 2017 and was noticed in such reviews as those by Ian Pople in [http://www.themanchesterreview.co.uk/?p=7508 ''The Manchester Review''] and Will May in [http://poeticsresearch.com/article/will-may-reviews-peter-robinsons-collected-poems/ ''Journal of Poetics Research'']. Individual poems by Peter Robinson have been translated into Brazilian Portuguese, Bulgarian, Dutch, German, Italian, Japanese, Macedonian, Romanian, and Spanish.

Alongside his poetry, Peter Robinson's ancillary activities have also received widespread critical attention. The translations of [[Vittorio Sereni]], made in collaboration with Marcus Perryman, were described by [[Charles Tomlinson]] in ''The Independent'' (1990) as 'versions that possess an uncanny accuracy, true to the fragmented, self-communing, smouldering and combustible humanity of Sereni's work'. Choosing ''The Great Friend and Other Translated Poems'' (2002) as a Poetry Book Society Recommended Translation, [[Douglas Dunn]] wrote that 'the range is eclectic without being scattered confusingly across too many languages and cultures. For me at least, much of this work is new' while Glyn Pursglove, reviewing the book in ''Acumen'', found that Robinson's 'attempted fidelity is not allowed to distort his own use of English and English verse and there is a great deal to admire and enjoy here. Indeed, one could wish the book a good deal longer.' John Welle called the translations of [[Luciano Erba]] (2007) 'marvellously attuned ... accurate, carefully crafted, and in harmony with the idiom and spirit of the originals.' They were awarded the 2008 [[John Florio Prize]].

Peter Robinson's literary criticism began to gain national attention when [[Donald Davie]] reviewed ''In the Circumstances: About Poems and Poets'' (1992) in the ''London Review of Books'' noting that 'Robinson deserves every credit for forcing his way into the thickets.' ''Poetry, Poets, Readers: Making Things Happen'' (2002) was welcomed by Andrea Brady in ''Poetry Review'' when she remarked that 'The conviction, pleasures and gratitude of committed reading are evident in this affirmation of the poetic contract between readers and writers.'Angela Leighton summed up his critical contribution in her review for the ''Times Literary Supplement'' of ''Twentieth Century Poetry: Selves and Situations'' (2005) when she wrote that 'Robinson has been a generous promoter of contemporary poetry for decades, and this collection of essays bears witness to his dedication and energy. He writes with an unformulaic enthusiasm, moving easily from biographical, political and poetic context to the nitty-gritty of close reading, while also striking an easy, readable tone'. Five years later, in the same journal, Justin Quinn found that ''Poetry & Translation: The Art of the Impossible'' (2010) was 'Vigorously and wittily argued ... an excellent and provocative contribution to a complex debate.'

More recently, Robinson has been able to make visible a greater range of his writings, publishing a selection of his aphorisms called ''Spirits of the Stair'' in 2009, ''Foreigners, Drunks and Babies: Eleven Stories'' in 2013, a collection of prose poetry and memoirs called ''The Draft Will'' (2015) and his first novel, ''September in the Rain'' in 2016. His fiction, especially, has been warmly received, with David Cooke writing in ''The London Magazine'' that the collection of short stories is 'an impressive body of work that deserves to gain a wider readership', while Paula Byrne wrote that '''September in the Rain'' is a novel of extraordinary beauty and courage', Jonathan Coe found in it 'a kind of redemption thanks to the tone or rueful, quizzical honesty', and Giles Foden saw it as 'a triumph of style, its sentences being assayed with a poet's feeling for the weight of each word.' In an early review, Ian Brinton described it on his ''Tears in the Fence'' blog for 29 August 2016 as 'a stunningly moving novel'. [https://tearsinthefence.com/blog/]

In October 2021, the publication of ''Peter Robinson: A Portrait of his Work'' edited by Tom Phillips and with chapters on many aspects of his writings by Ian Brinton, Peter Carpenter, Tony Crowley, Martin Dodsworth, Andrew Houwen, Miki Iwata, James Peake, Piers Pennington, Adam Piette, Elaine Randell, Anna Saroldi, Matthew Sperling and Alison Stone, with an up-to-date Bibliography by Derek Slade serves to illustrate the international range and depth of this British poet's interests and sympathies.
