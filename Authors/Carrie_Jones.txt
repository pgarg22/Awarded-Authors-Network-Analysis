==Career==
Jones's 2007 debut novel,<ref>{{cite news|title=''Tips on Having a Gay (ex) Boyfriend'' |work=fluxnow.com |access-date=January 20, 2010 |url=http://www.fluxnow.com/book_detail.php?ean=9780738710501 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513175446/http://www.fluxnow.com/book_detail.php?ean=9780738710501 |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 13, 2007 }}</ref> ''Tips on Having a Gay (ex) Boyfriend'', introduces a girl named Belle, whose longtime boyfriend Dylan eventually informs her that he is gay. The revelation leaves Belle torn between her resentment toward Dylan's secrecy, and her concern as he adjusts to his new identity in their town. Jones has labeled it a story of "self-discovery and understanding and all the different kinds of love out there."<ref name=cynsations/> The novel was based in part on an experience that Jones had during high school.<ref name=interviewone>{{cite news|title=Oh. My. Carlisle.

You can feel proud of him. You can feel sad that he was afraid to tell the truth for so long. You can feel used sometimes. You can feel angry sometimes, but eventually, lots of the time you still love him. You still care about him. You want the best for him. In ''Tips'' I really wanted those positive feelings to eventually come out."<ref name=interviewone/>

While reviewing the novel, Dana Rudolph of ''Bay Windows'' called it a story of "personal discovery," for both Dylan and Belle.<ref name=bwindows>{{cite news |first=Dana |last=Rudolph |title=Book Review: ''Tips on Having a Gay (ex) Boyfriend'' |work=baywindows.com |date=July 12, 2007 |access-date=January 20, 2010 |url=http://www.mombian.com/2007/07/13/book-review-tips-on-having-a-gay-ex-boyfriend/}}</ref> Rudolph also stated that the book "explores the broader ramifications of homophobia and closetedness without resorting to stereotypes."

===Writing approach===
During a 2009 interview, Jones was asked about the appeal of the young-adult genre, and how the lines between fantasy and the real world blurred in her writing. Her response was as follows:

{{Cquote|For me, so many of the themes in young-adult novels just hit home a lot more. The quest for identity and trying to find your place in the world. And in a way that really conveys into fantasy as well, because so often our characters are suddenly thrust into this world they know nothing about and everything has shifted and everything has changed. And that's so much like being thrust into adulthood, or thrust into high school, or thrust into so many things that we get thrust into as people in our journeys.

I think that for me part of the temptation of writing fantasy is because I want so badly to find some of that magic that we saw as children when we saw the world. And there's also this great element of escape in it—in not just the act of reading but in the act of writing it—where we can kind of leave this world and incorporate some ''aspects'' of it. Like my character really cares about Amnesty International and human rights, and that's this incredibly important thing that goes on in our contemporary world. But then you can convey it and leave those restraints, and kind of expand upon it and, it seems, by using the archetypes that are so often used in fantasy, just kind of broaden it, and make it so much bigger, and so much more epic and important.<ref>{{cite news |first=Diana |last=Gill |title=YA and Urban Fantasy—Crossing Generations and Genres |work=The Beyond |date=January 8, 2009 |access-date=January 20, 2010 |url=http://www.blogtalkradio.com/thebeyond/2009/01/08/ya-and-urban-fantasy-crossing-generations-and-genres}}</ref>}}
