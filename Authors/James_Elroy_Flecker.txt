'''James Elroy Flecker''' (5 November 1884 – 3 January 1915) was a British novelist and playwright. As a poet, he was most influenced by the [[Parnassian poets]].

==Biography==
Herman Elroy Flecker was born on 5 November 1884 in [[Lewisham]], [[London]], to William Herman Flecker (d. 1941), headmaster of [[Dean Close School]], Cheltenham, and his wife Sarah.<ref>Charles Williams: The Third Inkling, Grevel Lindop, Oxford University Press, 2015, p. 380</ref> His much younger brother was the educationalist Henry Lael Oswald Flecker (1896–1958), who became Headmaster of [[Christ's Hospital]].<ref>{{cite web |url = https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/henry-lael-oswald-flecker-18961958-headmaster-of-christs-hospital-69784 |title = Henry Lael Oswald Flecker (1896–1958), Headmaster of Christ's Hospital |publisher = Art UK |access-date = 22 March 2019 }}</ref>

Flecker later chose to use the first name "James", either because he disliked the name "Herman" or to avoid confusion with his father. "Roy", as his family called him, was educated at Dean Close School, then at [[Uppingham School]]. He subsequently studied at [[Trinity College, Oxford]], and at [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]]. While at Oxford he was greatly influenced by the last flowering of the [[Aesthetic movement]] there under [[John Addington Symonds]], and became a close friend of the classicist and art historian [[John Beazley]].<ref name="DoAH Bio">{{cite web|title=Beazley, J[ohn] D[avidson], Sir|url=http://arthistorians.info/beazleyj

From 1910 Flecker worked in the consular service in the [[Eastern Mediterranean]]. On a ship to [[Athens]] he met Helle Skiadaressi,<ref name="Walker">Walker, Heather.  ''Roses and Rain'' (2006). Melrose Books. {{ISBN|1-905226-06-3}}</ref> and in 1911 he married her.

Flecker died on 3 January 1915, of [[tuberculosis]], in [[Davos]], [[Switzerland]] but was buried in [[Bouncer's Lane Cemetery, Cheltenham|Cheltenham]]. His death at the age of thirty was described at the time as "unquestionably the greatest premature loss that English literature has suffered since the death of [[John Keats|Keats]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://classiclit.about.com/cs/profileswriters/p/aa_jeflecker.htm |title=James Elroy Flecker, About.com |publisher=Classiclit.about.com |date=3 January 1915 |access-date=23 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621165127/http://classiclit.about.com/cs/profileswriters/p/aa_jeflecker.htm |archive-date=21 June 2015  }}</ref>

==Works and influence==
The excerpt from Flecker's verse drama ''Hassan  ... The Golden Journey to Samarkand'' inscribed on the clock tower of the barracks of the British Army's 22 [[Special Air Service]] regiment in [[Hereford]] provides an enduring testimony to Flecker's work:

{{quote|We are the Pilgrims, master; we shall go<br>Always a little further; it may be<br>Beyond that last blue mountain barred with snow<br>Across that angry or that glimmering sea.<ref>
The same extract appears on the UK SAS Memorial in Herefordshire ({{cite news|last=Popham |first=Peter |date=30 May 1996 |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-sas-confronts-its-enemy-within-1349761.html |title=SAS confronts its enemy within|newspaper=[[The Independent]]}})
</ref>}}

The same inscription also appears on the [[NZSAS]] monument at Rennie Lines in the [[Papakura Military Camp]] in New Zealand, and at the [[Indian Army]]'s [[Indian Special Forces Training School (SFTS)|Special Forces Training School]] in [[Nahan]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], India.<ref>{{cite web|last=Staff |date=15 September 2009 |url=http://www.army.mil.nz/at-a-glance/news/army-news/402/tsftitsas.htm |title=The Selected Few – Training in the SAS |publisher=[New Zealand Army] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918151107/http://army.mil.nz/at-a-glance/news/army-news/402/tsftitsas.htm |archive-date=18 September 2010 }}

A character in the second volume of [[Anthony Powell]]'s [[novel sequence]], ''[[A Dance to the Music of Time]]'', is said to be "fond of intoning" the lines ''For lust of knowing what we should not know / We take the Golden Road to Samarkand'', without an attribution to Flecker. (This is in fact a misquotation, the original reads "...what should not be known").

[[Saki]]'s short story "A Defensive Diamond" (in ''[[Beasts and Super-Beasts]]'', 1914) references "The Golden Journey to Samarkand".

[[Agatha Christie]] quotes Flecker several times, especially in her final novel, ''[[Postern of Fate]]'' (1973).

[[Jorge Luis Borges]] quotes a quatrain from Flecker's poem "To a Poet a Thousand Years Hence" in his essay "Note on [[Walt Whitman]]" (available in the collection ''Other Inquisitions, 1937–1952''):

{{quote|O friend unseen, unborn, unknown,<br>Student of our sweet English tongue,<br>Read out my words at night, alone:<br>I was a poet, I was young.}}

[[Nevil Shute]] quotes from ''Hassan'' in ''[[Marazan]]'' (1926), his first published novel, and in the headings of many of the chapters in his 1951 novel [[Round the Bend (novel)|''Round the Bend'']].

The Pilgrims' Song from ''Hassan'' and its setting by Delius play a pivotal role at the beginning of [[Elizabeth Goudge]]'s novel ''The Castle on the Hill'' (1942).<ref>Elizabeth Goudge, ''The Castle on the Hill'', Chapters I.i, II.i</ref>

[[Diana Rigg]] quotes an amended stanza (not the original)  from ''Hassan'' in the 1969 film ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'' as she looks out of the window of Piz Gloria at the sun rising over the Swiss alps:

{{quote|Thy dawn, O Master of the World, thy dawn;<br>For thee the sunlight creeps across the lawn,<br>For thee the ships are drawn down to the waves,<br>For thee the markets throng with myriad slaves,<br>For thee the hammer on the anvil rings,<br>For thee the poet of beguilement sings.}}

The original in Flecker's play is more romantic, and makes clear that the Caliph is being addressed, not the Almighty:
{{quote|Thy dawn O Master of the world, thy dawn;<br>The hour the lilies open on the lawn,<br>The hour the grey wings pass beyond the mountains,<br>The hour of silence, when we hear the fountains,<br>The hour that dreams are brighter and winds colder,<br>The hour that young love wakes on a white shoulder,<br>O Master of the world, the Persian Dawn.<br><br>That hour, O Master, shall be bright for thee:<br>Thy merchants chase the morning down the sea,<br>The braves who fight thy war unsheathe the sabre,<br>The slaves who work thy mines are lashed to labour,<br>For thee the waggons of the world are drawn  – <br>The ebony of night, the red of dawn!}}In ''[[Flashman at the Charge]]'' (1973), author [[George MacDonald Fraser]] concludes a final scene with a [[decasyllable]] [[quatrain]] [[pastiche]] in Flecker’s style.  Following many misadventures suffered by the book’s picaresque hero Harry Flashman, brother-in-arms rebel leader [[Yakub Beg]] waxes poetic and evokes the mystique of middle Asia with its concomitant voyage of self-discovery and friendships hard won by reciting:

{{quote|To learn the age-old lesson day by day:<br>It is not in the bright arrival planned,<br>But in the dreams men dream along the way,<br>They find the Golden Road to Samarkand.}}

Flecker's poem "The Bridge of Fire" features in [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[The Sandman (DC Comics Modern Age)|Sandman]]'' series, in the volume ''[[The Sandman: The Wake|The Wake]]'', and ''The Golden Journey to Samarkand'' is quoted in the volume ''[[The Sandman: World's End|World's End]]''.

In [[Vikram Seth]]'s "[[A Suitable Boy]]<ref>Vikram Seth, ''A Suitable Boy'', chapter 1.16</ref>" the young English Literature lecturer Dr Pran Kapoor attempts to reduce colonial influence in the syllabus and suggests removing Flecker (to make room for [[James Joyce]]). Professor Mishra disagrees and quotes from "The Gates of Damascus"

{{quote|Pass not beneath,O Caravan, or pass not singing. Have you heard<br>That silence where the birds are dead yet something pipeth like a bird.<ref>https://allpoetry.com/The-Gates-of-Damascus|title=The Gates of Damascus by James Elroy Flecker|access-date=2021-05-19</ref>}}
