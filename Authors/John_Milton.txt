'''John Milton''' (9 December 1608{{spaced ndash}}8 November 1674) was an English poet and intellectual who served as a civil servant for the [[Commonwealth of England]] under its Council of State and later under [[Oliver Cromwell]]. He wrote at a time of religious flux and political upheaval, and is best known for his [[epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (1667). Written in [[blank verse]], Paradise Lost is widely considered to be one of the greatest works of English literature.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Rogers|first=John|title=Paradise Lost, Book I|website=[[YouTube]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H62G9yIN5Wk&list=PL2103FD9F9D0615B7&index=9| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211030/H62G9yIN5Wk| archive-date=2021-10-30|url-status=live}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

Writing in English, [[Latin]], and Italian, he achieved international renown within his lifetime; his celebrated ''[[Areopagitica]]'' (1644), written in condemnation of [[Prior restraint|pre-publication censorship]], is among history's most influential and impassioned defences of [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of the press]]. His desire for freedom extended into his style: he introduced new words (coined from Latin and Ancient Greek) to the English language, and was the first modern writer to employ unrhymed verse outside of the theatre or translations.

[[William Hayley]]'s 1796 biography called him the "greatest English author",<ref>McCalman 2001 p. 605.</ref> and he remains generally regarded "as one of the pre-eminent writers in the English language",<ref>''Contemporary Literary Criticism''. [http://www.enotes.com/literary-criticism/milton-john "Milton, John – Introduction"].</ref> though critical reception has oscillated in the centuries since his death (often on account of his [[republicanism]]). [[Samuel Johnson]] praised ''Paradise Lost'' as "a poem which ... with respect to design may claim the first place, and with respect to performance, the second, among the productions of the human mind", though he (a [[Tory]]) described Milton's politics as those of an "acrimonious and surly republican".<ref name=Works>{{cite book|last=Murphy|first=Arthur|title=The Works of Samuel Johnson, LL.

==Biography==
The phases of Milton's life parallel the major historical and political divisions in [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] Britain. Milton studied, travelled, wrote poetry mostly for private circulation, and launched a career as pamphleteer and publicist under the increasingly personal rule of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and its breakdown into constitutional confusion and war. The shift in accepted attitudes in government placed him in public office under the [[Commonwealth of England]], from being thought dangerously radical and heretical, and he even acted as an official spokesman in certain of his publications. The [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of 1660 deprived Milton, now completely blind, of his public platform, but this period saw him complete most of his major works of poetry.

Milton's views developed from his very extensive reading, as well as travel and experience, from his student days of the 1620s to the [[English Civil War]].<ref>Masson 1859 pp. v–vi.</ref> By the time of his death in 1674, Milton was impoverished and on the margins of English intellectual life, yet famous throughout Europe and unrepentant for his political choices.

===Early life===
{{Main|Early life of John Milton}}
[[File:John Milton plaque Bread Street London.jpg|thumb|left|Blue plaque in Bread Street, London, where Milton was born]]

John Milton was born in [[Bread Street]], London, on 9 December 1608, the son of composer [[John Milton (composer)|John Milton]] and his wife Sarah Jeffrey. The senior John Milton (1562–1647) moved to London around 1583 after being disinherited by his devout Catholic father Richard "the Ranger" Milton for embracing Protestantism.<ref name=":3" /> In London, the senior John Milton married Sarah Jeffrey (1572–1637) and found lasting financial success as a [[scrivener]].<ref name=Forsyth16>{{cite book |last=Forsyth |first=Neil |title=John Milton A Biography |edition=1st |year=2008 |publisher=[[Lion Hudson]] |location=Wilkinson House, Jordan Hill Road, Oxford OX2 8DR, England |isbn=978-0-7459-5310-6 |page=[https://archive.org/details/johnmiltonbiogra0000fors/page/16 16] |chapter=St. Paul's |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/johnmiltonbiogra0000fors/page/16 }}</ref> He lived in and worked from a house on Bread Street, where the [[Mermaid Tavern]] was located in [[Cheapside]]. The elder Milton was noted for his skill as a musical composer, and this talent left his son with a lifelong appreciation for music and friendships with musicians such as [[Henry Lawes]].<ref>Lewalski 2003 p. 3.</ref>

Milton's father's prosperity provided his eldest son with a private tutor, [[Thomas Young (1587–1655)|Thomas Young]], a Scottish Presbyterian with an M.A. from the [[University of St. Andrews]]. Research suggests that Young's influence served as the poet's introduction to religious radicalism.<ref>Skerpan-Wheeler, Elizabeth. "John Milton." British Rhetoricians and Logicians, 1500–1660: Second Series. Ed. Edward A. Malone. Detroit: Gale, 2003. Dictionary of Literary Biography Vol. 281. Literature Resource Center.</ref> After Young's tutorship, Milton attended [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]] in London. There he began the study of Latin and Greek, and the classical languages left an imprint on both his poetry and prose in English (he also wrote in Latin and Italian).

[[File:John Milton portrait.jpg|thumb|John Milton at age 10 by [[Cornelis Janssens van Ceulen]]. In [[Milton's Cottage]], [[Chalfont St Giles]].]]

Milton's first datable compositions are two psalms done at age 15 at [[Long Bennington]]. One contemporary source is the ''[[Brief Lives]]'' of [[John Aubrey]], an uneven compilation including first-hand reports. In the work, Aubrey quotes Christopher, Milton's younger brother: "When he was young, he studied very hard and sat up very late, commonly till twelve or one o'clock at night". Aubrey adds, "His complexion exceeding faire—he was so faire that they called him the Lady of Christ's College."<ref name=OLD>Dick 1962 pp. 270–75.</ref>

In 1625, Milton began attending [[Christ's College, Cambridge]]. He graduated with a B.A. in 1629,<ref>{{acad|id=MLTN624J|name=Milton, John}}</ref> ranking fourth of 24&nbsp;honours graduates that year in the University of Cambridge.<ref>Hunter 1980 p. 99.</ref> Preparing to become an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] priest, Milton stayed on and obtained his [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts degree]] on 3 July 1632.

Milton may have been [[rustication (academia)|rusticated]] (suspended) in his first year for quarrelling with his tutor, Bishop [[William Chappell (bishop)|William Chappell]]. He was certainly at home in London in the Lent Term 1626; there he wrote his ''Elegia Prima'', a first Latin [[elegy]], to Charles Diodati, a friend from St Paul's. Based on remarks of [[John Aubrey]], Chappell "whipt" Milton.<ref name=OLD/> This story is now disputed, though certainly Milton disliked Chappell.<ref>Wedgwood 1961 p. 178.</ref> Historian [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] cautiously notes that Milton was "apparently" rusticated, and that the differences between Chappell and Milton may have been either religious or personal.<ref>Hill 1977 p. 34.</ref> It is also possible that, like [[Isaac Newton]] four decades later, Milton was sent home because of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]], by which Cambridge was badly affected in 1625. In 1626, Milton's tutor was [[Nathaniel Tovey]].

At Cambridge, Milton was on good terms with [[Edward King (British poet)|Edward King]], for whom he later wrote "[[Lycidas]]". He also befriended Anglo-American dissident and theologian [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]]. Milton tutored Williams in Hebrew in exchange for lessons in Dutch.<ref>Pfeiffer 1955 pp. 363–73.</ref>{{Better source needed|date=June 2021|reason=Pfeiffer does not cite his source}} Despite developing a reputation for poetic skill and general erudition, Milton experienced alienation from his peers and university life as a whole. Having once watched his fellow students attempting comedy upon the college stage, he later observed 'they thought themselves gallant men, and I thought them fools'.<ref>Milton 1959 pp. 887–88.</ref>

Milton was disdainful of the university curriculum, which consisted of stilted formal debates conducted in Latin on abstruse topics. His own corpus is not devoid of humour, notably his sixth [[wikt:prolusion|prolusion]] and his epitaphs on the death of [[Thomas Hobson]]. While at Cambridge, he wrote a number of his well-known shorter English poems, among them "On the Morning of Christ's Nativity", his "Epitaph on the admirable Dramaticke Poet, W. Shakespeare" (his first poem to appear in print), ''[[L'Allegro]]'', and ''[[Il Penseroso]]''.

|quote=It appears in all his writings that he had the usual concomitant of great abilities, a lofty and steady confidence in himself, perhaps not without some contempt of others; for scarcely any man ever wrote so much, and praised so few. Of his praise he was very frugal; as he set its value high, and considered his mention of a name as a security against the waste of time, and a certain preservative from oblivion.<ref>Johnson 1826 Vol. I. p. 64.</ref>
|source=– [[Samuel Johnson]], ''[[Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets]]''
}}

Upon receiving his M.A. in 1632, Milton retired to [[Hammersmith]], his father's new home since the previous year. He also lived at [[Horton, Berkshire|Horton]], Berkshire, from 1635 and undertook six years of self-directed private study. Hill argues that this was not retreat into a rural idyll; Hammersmith was then a "suburban village" falling into the orbit of London, and even Horton was becoming deforested and suffered from the plague.<ref>Hill 1977 p. 38.</ref> He read both ancient and modern works of theology, philosophy, history, politics, literature, and science in preparation for a prospective poetical career. Milton's intellectual development can be charted via entries in his [[commonplace book]] (like a scrapbook), now in the [[British Library]]. As a result of such intensive study, Milton is considered to be among the most learned of all English poets. In addition to his years of private study, Milton had command of Latin, Greek, Hebrew, French, Spanish, and Italian from his school and undergraduate days; he also added Old English to his linguistic repertoire in the 1650s while researching his ''History of Britain'', and probably acquired proficiency in Dutch soon after.<ref>Lewalski 2003 p. 103.</ref>

[[File:John Milton plaque Berkyn Manor Farm Horton.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Commemorative blue plaque 'John Milton lived here 1632–1638' at Berkyn Manor Farm, [[Horton, Berkshire]]]]

Milton continued to write poetry during this period of study; his ''[[Arcades (Milton)|Arcades]]'' and ''[[Comus (John Milton)|Comus]]'' were both commissioned for [[masques]] composed for noble patrons, connections of the Egerton family, and performed in 1632 and 1634 respectively. ''Comus'' argues for the virtuousness of [[temperance (virtue)|temperance]] and [[chastity]].  He contributed his [[pastoral]] [[elegy]] ''[[Lycidas]]'' to a memorial collection for one of his fellow-students at Cambridge.  Drafts of these poems are preserved in Milton's poetry notebook, known as the Trinity Manuscript because it is now kept at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], Cambridge.

In May 1638, Milton embarked upon a tour of France and Italy that lasted until July or August 1639.<ref>Chaney 1985 and 2000.</ref> His travels supplemented his study with new and direct experience of artistic and religious traditions, especially Roman Catholicism. He met famous theorists and intellectuals of the time, and was able to display his poetic skills. For specific details of what happened within Milton's "[[grand tour]]", there appears to be just one [[primary source]]: Milton's own ''[[Defensio Secunda]]''. There are other records, including some letters and some references in his other prose tracts, but the bulk of the information about the tour comes from a work that, according to [[Barbara Lewalski]], "was not intended as autobiography but as rhetoric, designed to emphasise his sterling reputation with the learned of Europe."<ref>Lewalski 2003 pp. 87–88.</ref>

He first went to [[Calais]] and then on to Paris, riding horseback, with a letter from diplomat [[Henry Wotton]] to ambassador [[John Scudamore (ambassador)|John Scudamore]]. Through Scudamore, Milton met [[Hugo Grotius]], a Dutch law philosopher, playwright, and poet. Milton left France soon after this meeting. He travelled south from [[Nice, France|Nice]] to [[Genoa]], and then to [[Livorno]] and [[Pisa]]. He reached Florence in July 1638. While there, Milton enjoyed many of the sites and structures of the city. His candour of manner and erudite neo-Latin poetry earned him friends in Florentine intellectual circles, and he met the astronomer [[Galileo]] who was under [[house arrest]] at [[Arcetri]], as well as others.<ref>Lewalski 2003 pp. 88–94.</ref> Milton probably visited the Florentine Academy and the [[Accademia della Crusca]] along with smaller academies in the area, including the Apatisti and the [[Svogliati]].

{{quote box |width=40% |quote=In [Florence], which I have always admired above all others because of the elegance, not just of its tongue, but also of its wit, I lingered for about two months. There I at once became the friend of many gentlemen eminent in rank and learning, whose private academies I frequented—a Florentine institution which deserves great praise not only for promoting humane studies but also for encouraging friendly intercourse.<ref>Milton 1959 Vol. IV part I. pp. 615–17.</ref> |source=– Milton's account of Florence in ''Defensio Secunda''}}

He left Florence in September to continue to Rome. With the connections from Florence, Milton was able to have easy access to Rome's intellectual society. His poetic abilities impressed those like Giovanni Salzilli, who praised Milton within an epigram. In late October, Milton attended a dinner given by the [[English College, Rome]], despite his dislike for the [[Society of Jesus]], meeting English Catholics who were also guests—theologian [[Henry Holden]] and the poet [[Patrick Cary]].<ref>Chaney 1985 and 2000 and Lewalski p. 96.</ref> He also attended musical events, including oratorios, operas, and melodramas. Milton left for [[Naples]] toward the end of November, where he stayed only for a month because of the Spanish control.<ref>Chaney 1985 p. 244–51 and Chaney 2000 p. 313.</ref> During that time, he was introduced to Giovanni Battista Manso, patron to both [[Torquato Tasso]] and to [[Giambattista Marino]].<ref>Lewalski 2003 pp. 94–98.</ref>

Originally, Milton wanted to leave Naples in order to travel to [[Sicily]] and then on to Greece, but he returned to England during the summer of 1639 because of what he claimed in ''Defensio Secunda''<ref>Lewalski 2003 p. 98.</ref> were "sad tidings of civil war in England."<ref>Milton 1959 Vol. IV part I pp. 618–19.</ref> Matters became more complicated when Milton received word that his childhood friend Diodati had died. Milton in fact stayed another seven months on the continent, and spent time at [[Geneva]] with Diodati's uncle after he returned to Rome. In ''Defensio Secunda'', Milton proclaimed that he was warned against a return to Rome because of his frankness about religion, but he stayed in the city for two months and was able to experience [[Carnival]] and meet [[Lukas Holste]], a Vatican librarian who guided Milton through its collection. He was introduced to Cardinal [[Francesco Barberini (1597–1679)|Francesco Barberini]] who invited Milton to an opera hosted by the Cardinal. Around March, Milton travelled once again to Florence, staying there for two months, attending further meetings of the academies, and spending time with friends. After leaving Florence, he travelled through Lucca, Bologna, and Ferrara before coming to [[Venice]]. In Venice, Milton was exposed to a model of Republicanism, later important in his political writings, but he soon found another model when he travelled to Geneva. From Switzerland, Milton travelled to Paris and then to Calais before finally arriving back in England in either July or August 1639.<ref>Lewalski 2003 pp. 99–109.</ref>

===Civil war, prose tracts, and marriage===
{{Main|Milton's antiprelatical tracts}}
[[File:Areopagitica bridwell.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Title page of the 1644 edition of ''[[Areopagitica]]'']]

On returning to England where the [[Bishops' Wars]] presaged further armed conflict, Milton began to write prose [[tract (literature)|tracts]] against [[episcopacy]], in the service of the [[Puritan]] and [[Long Parliament|Parliamentary]] cause. Milton's first foray into polemics was ''Of Reformation touching Church Discipline in England'' (1641), followed by ''Of Prelatical Episcopacy'', the two defences of [[Smectymnuus]] (a group of Presbyterian divines named from their initials; the "TY" belonged to Milton's old tutor Thomas Young), and ''[[The Reason of Church-Government Urged against Prelaty]]''. He vigorously attacked the High-church party of the Church of England and their leader [[William Laud]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], with frequent passages of real eloquence lighting up the rough controversial style of the period, and deploying a wide knowledge of church history.

He was supported by his father's investments, but Milton became a private schoolmaster at this time, educating his nephews and other children of the well-to-do. This experience and discussions with educational reformer [[Samuel Hartlib]] led him to write his short tract ''[[Of Education]]'' in 1644, urging a reform of the national universities.

In June 1642, Milton paid a visit to the manor house at [[Forest Hill, Oxfordshire]], and returned with 16-year-old bride Mary Powell.<ref name="ODNB Milton">{{cite ODNB|first=Gordon|last=Campbell|title=Milton, John (1608–1674)|volume=1|year=2004|edition=Online|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18800|access-date=25 October 2013|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/18800}} </ref><ref>Lobel 1957 pp. 122–34.</ref> Mary found life difficult with the severe 35-year-old schoolmaster and pamphleteer, and she returned to her family a month later. She did not return until 1645, partly because of the outbreak of the [[First English Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name="ODNB Milton"/>

In the meantime, her desertion prompted Milton to publish [[Milton's divorce tracts|a series of pamphlets]] over the next three years arguing for the legality and morality of divorce. ([[Anna Beer]], one of Milton's most recent biographers, points to a lack of evidence and the dangers of cynicism in urging that it was not necessarily the case that the private life so animated the public polemicising.) In 1643, Milton had a brush with the authorities over these writings, in parallel with [[Hezekiah Woodward]], who had more trouble.<ref>Lewalski 2003 pp. 181–82, 600.</ref> It was the hostile response accorded the divorce tracts that spurred Milton to write ''[[Areopagitica|Areopagitica; A speech of Mr. John Milton for the Liberty of Unlicenc'd Printing, to the Parlament of England]]'', his celebrated attack on pre-printing censorship.  In ''Areopagitica'', Milton aligns himself with the [[Roundhead|parliamentary cause]], and he also begins to synthesize the ideal of neo-Roman liberty with that of Christian liberty.<ref>Ann Hughes, 'Milton, Areopagitica, and the Parliamentary Cause', ''The Oxford Handbook of Milton'', ed. Nicholas McDowell and Nigel Smith, Oxford University Press, 2009</ref><ref>Blair Hoxby, 'Areopagitica and Liberty', ''The Oxford Handbook of Milton'', ed. Nicholas McDowell and Nigel Smith, Oxford University Press, 2009</ref>

===Secretary for Foreign Tongues===
With the parliamentary victory in the Civil War, Milton used his pen in defence of the republican principles represented by the Commonwealth. ''[[The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates]]'' (1649) defended the right of the people to hold their rulers to account, and implicitly sanctioned the [[regicide]]; Milton's political reputation got him appointed Secretary for Foreign Tongues by the Council of State in March 1649. His main job description was to compose the English Republic's foreign correspondence in [[New Latin|Latin]] and other languages, but he also was called upon to produce propaganda for the regime and to serve as a censor.<ref>C. Sullivan, 'Milton and the Beginning of Civil Service', in ''Literature in the Public Service'' (2013), Ch. 2.</ref>

[[File:19 York Street, Westminster (1848).jpg|thumb|The back of no 19 York Street (1848). In 1651, Milton moved into a "pretty garden-house" in [[Petty France, Westminster]]. He lived there until the Restoration. Later it became No. 19 York Street, belonged to [[Jeremy Bentham]], was occupied successively by [[James Mill]] and [[William Hazlitt]], and finally was demolished in 1877.<ref>{{cite DNB |first=Leslie |last=Stephen |title=Milton, John (1608-1674)|volume=38|p=32}}</ref>]]

In October 1649, he published ''[[Eikonoklastes]]'', an explicit defence of the regicide, in response to the ''[[Eikon Basilike]]'', a phenomenal best-seller popularly attributed to Charles I that portrayed the King as an innocent Christian [[martyr]]. Milton tried to break this powerful image of Charles I (the literal translation of Eikonoklastes is 'the image breaker'). A month later, however, the exiled [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and his party published the defence of monarchy ''Defensio Regia pro Carolo Primo'', written by leading humanist [[Claudius Salmasius]]. By January of the following year, Milton was ordered to write a defence of the English people by the [[English Council of State|Council of State]]. Milton worked more slowly than usual, given the European audience and the English Republic's desire to establish diplomatic and cultural legitimacy, as he drew on the learning marshalled by his years of study to compose a riposte.

On 24 February 1652, Milton published his Latin defence of the English people ''[[Defensio pro Populo Anglicano]]'', also known as the ''First Defence''. Milton's pure Latin prose and evident learning exemplified in the ''First Defence'' quickly made him a European reputation, and the work ran to numerous editions.<ref>von Maltzahn 1999 p. 239.</ref> He addressed his ''Sonnet 16'' to 'The Lord Generall Cromwell in May 1652' beginning  "Cromwell, our chief of men...", although it was not published until 1654.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=POOLEY|first=ROGER|date=1993|title=The poets' Cromwell|journal=Critical Survey|volume=5|issue=3|pages=223–234|jstor=41555744}}</ref>

In 1654, Milton completed the second defence of the English nation ''Defensio secunda'' in response to an anonymous Royalist tract ''"Regii Sanguinis Clamor ad Coelum Adversus Parricidas Anglicanos"'' [The Cry of the Royal Blood to Heaven  Against the English Parricides], a work that made many personal attacks on Milton.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cOoXuk5wEbQC&q=Regii+sanguinis+clam+royalist|title=The Milton Encyclopedia|last=Corns|first=Thomas N.|date=2012|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300094442|pages=216}}</ref> The second defence praised [[Oliver Cromwell]], now Lord Protector, while exhorting him to remain true to the principles of the Revolution. [[Alexander Morus]], to whom Milton wrongly attributed the ''Clamor'' (in fact by [[Peter du Moulin]]), published an attack on Milton, in response to which Milton published the autobiographical ''Defensio pro se'' in 1655. Milton held the appointment of Secretary for Foreign Tongues to the Commonwealth Council of State until 1660, although after he had become totally blind, most of the work was done by his deputies, [[Georg Rudolph Wecklein]], then [[Philip Meadows (died 1718)|Philip Meadows]], and from 1657 by the poet [[Andrew Marvell]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/milton-appointed-latin-secretary|title=Milton appointed Latin Secretary {{!}} History Today|website=www.historytoday.com|access-date=3 August 2018}}</ref>

By 1652, Milton had become totally blind;<ref>John Leonard, in the introduction to "Paradise Lost", Penguin Classics page ix  2000</ref> the cause of his blindness is debated but bilateral [[retinal detachment]] or [[glaucoma]] are most likely.<ref name=pmid18168884>{{cite journal|last=Sorsby|first=A.|title=On The Nature of Milton's Blindness|journal=British Journal of Ophthalmology|year=1930|volume=14|issue=7|pages=339–54|pmid=18168884|pmc=511199|doi=10.1136/bjo.14.7.339}}</ref> His blindness forced him to dictate his [[Verse (poetry)|verse]] and prose to [[Amanuensis|amanuenses]] who copied them out for him; one of these was Andrew Marvell. One of his best-known sonnets, ''[[When I Consider How My Light is Spent]]'', titled by a later editor, [[John Newton]], "''On His Blindness''", is presumed to date from this period.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shawcross|first=John T.|title=The Poet in the Poem: John Milton's Presence in "Paradise Lost"|date=1986|journal=CEA Critic|volume=48/49|pages=32–55|jstor=44378181}}</ref>

===The Restoration===
[[File:John Milton 1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Engraving]] by [[William Faithorne]], 1670]]
Cromwell's death in 1658 caused the English Republic to collapse into feuding military and political factions. Milton, however, stubbornly clung to the beliefs that had originally inspired him to write for the Commonwealth. In 1659, he published ''[[A Treatise of Civil Power]]'', attacking the concept of a state-dominated church (the position known as [[Erastianism]]), as well as ''Considerations touching the likeliest means to remove hirelings'', denouncing corrupt practises in church governance. As the Republic disintegrated, Milton wrote several proposals to retain a non-monarchical government against the wishes of parliament, soldiers, and the people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.christs.cam.ac.uk/john-milton/miltons-works|title=Milton's Works|date=3 February 2017|website=Milton's Works|publisher=Christ's College Cambridge}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lewalski|first=Barbara Kiefer|year=1959|title=Milton: Political Beliefs and Polemical Methods, 1659–60|jstor=460581|journal=PMLA|volume=74|issue=3|pages=191–202|doi=10.2307/460581}}</ref>

*''A Letter to a Friend, Concerning the Ruptures of the Commonwealth'', written in October 1659, was a response to [[John Lambert (general)|General Lambert]]'s recent dissolution of the [[Rump Parliament]].
*''Proposals of certain expedients for the preventing of a civil war now feared'', written in November 1659.
*''[[The Ready and Easy Way to Establishing a Free Commonwealth]]'', in two editions, responded to [[George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle|General Monck]]'s march towards London to restore the [[Long Parliament]] (which led to the restoration of the monarchy). The work is an impassioned, bitter, and futile [[jeremiad]] damning the English people for backsliding from the cause of [[liberty]] and advocating the establishment of an authoritarian rule by an [[oligarchy]] set up by unelected parliament.

Upon the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] in May 1660, Milton, fearing for his life, went into hiding, while a [[Warrant (law)|warrant]] was issued for his arrest and his writings were burnt. He re-emerged after [[Indemnity and Oblivion Act|a general pardon]] was issued, but was nevertheless arrested and briefly imprisoned before influential friends intervened, such as Marvell, now an MP. Milton married for a third and final time on 24 February 1663, marrying Elizabeth (Betty) Minshull, aged 24, a native of [[Wistaston]], Cheshire. He spent the remaining decade of his life living quietly in London, only retiring to a cottage during the [[Great Plague of London]]—[[Milton's Cottage]] in [[Chalfont St. Giles]], his only extant home.

During this period, Milton published several minor prose works, such as the grammar textbook ''Art of Logic'' and a ''History of Britain''. His only explicitly political tracts were the 1672 ''Of True Religion'', arguing for [[toleration]] (except for Catholics), and a translation of a Polish tract advocating an elective monarchy. Both these works were referred to in the [[Exclusion Bill|Exclusion]] debate, the attempt to exclude the heir presumptive from the throne of England—[[James, Duke of York]]—because he was Roman Catholic. That debate preoccupied politics in the 1670s and 1680s and precipitated the formation of the [[British Whig Party|Whig party]] and the [[Glorious Revolution]].

===Family===
Milton and his first wife Mary Powell (1625–1652) had four children:<ref>Dates in this section are taken from John Milton's autograph memoranda in his Bible, in the British Library, [[call number]] Add MS 32310.</ref>
*Anne (born 29 July 1646)
*Mary (born 25 October 1648)
*John (16 March 1651 – June 1652)
*Deborah (2 May 1652 – 10 August 1727<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Monthly Mirror: Reflecting Men and Manners|publisher=Harding & Wright|year=1810|location=Edinburgh|pages=49|via=Google Books}}</ref>)

Mary Powell died on 5 May 1652 from complications following Deborah's birth. Milton's daughters survived to adulthood, but he always had a strained relationship with them.

On 12 November 1656, Milton was married to Katherine Woodcock at [[St Margaret's, Westminster]].<ref>'Milton, John', in ''Journal of the Society of Arts'', 8 November 1867, p. 755</ref> She died on 3 February 1658, less than four months after giving birth to her daughter Katherine, who also died.

Milton married for a third time on 24 February 1663 to Elizabeth Mynshull or Minshull (1638–1728), the niece of Thomas Mynshull, a wealthy apothecary and philanthropist in [[Manchester]]. The marriage took place at [[St Mary Aldermary]] in the City of London. Despite a 31-year age gap, the marriage seemed happy, according to [[John Aubrey]], and lasted more than 12 years until Milton's death. (A plaque on the wall of Mynshull's House in Manchester describes Elizabeth as Milton's "3rd and Best wife".) Samuel Johnson, however, claims that Mynshull was "a domestic companion and attendant" and that Milton's nephew [[Edward Phillips]] relates that Mynshull "oppressed his children in his lifetime, and cheated them at his death".<ref>Johnson 1826 Vol. I 86.</ref>

His nephews, [[Edward Phillips|Edward]] and [[John Phillips (author)|John Phillips]] (sons of Milton's sister Anne), were educated by Milton and became writers themselves. John acted as a secretary, and Edward was Milton's first biographer.

==Poetry==
Milton's poetry was slow to see the light of day, at least under his name. His first published poem was "On Shakespeare" (1630), anonymously included in the [[Second Folio]] edition of [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays in 1632. An annotated copy of the [[First Folio]] has been suggested to contain marginal notes by Milton.<ref>Flood, Alison,  ''[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/16/when-milton-met-shakespeare-poets-notes-on-bard-appear-to-have-been-found? When Milton met Shakespeare: poet's notes on Bard appear to have been found ]'', The Guardian, 16 September 2019</ref> Milton collected his work in ''[[1645 Poems]]'' in the midst of the excitement attending the possibility of establishing a new English government. The anonymous edition of ''Comus'' was published in 1637, and the publication of ''Lycidas'' in 1638 in ''Justa Edouardo King Naufrago'' was signed J. M. Otherwise. The 1645 collection was the only poetry of his to see print until ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' appeared in 1667.

===''Paradise Lost''===
{{Main|Paradise Lost}}
[[File:Milton diktiert seinen Töchtern das »Paradise Lost« (Eugène Ferdinand Victor Delacroix).jpg|thumb|''Milton Dictates the Lost Paradise to His Three Daughters'', ca. 1826, by [[Eugène Delacroix]] ]]

Milton's ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', the [[blank-verse]] [[epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', was composed by the blind and impoverished Milton from 1658 to 1664 (first edition), with small but significant revisions published in 1674 (second edition). As a blind poet, Milton dictated his verse to a series of aides in his employ. It has been argued that the poem reflects his personal despair at the failure of the [[English Civil War|Revolution]] yet affirms an ultimate optimism in human potential. Some literary critics have argued that Milton encoded many references to his unyielding support for the "[[Good Old Cause]]".<ref>Hill 1977.</ref>

On 27 April 1667,<ref name=Lindenbaum1995>{{cite journal|last=Lindenbaum|first=Peter|year=1995|title=Authors and Publishers in the Late Seventeenth Century: New Evidence on their Relations|journal=The Library|publisher=Oxford University Press|volume=s6-17|issue=3|pages=250–69|issn=0024-2160|doi=10.1093/library/s6-17.3.250}}</ref> Milton sold the publication rights for ''Paradise Lost'' to publisher [[Samuel Simmons]] for £5 (equivalent to approximately £770 in 2015 purchasing power),<ref>[http://www.measuringworth.com/ppoweruk/ ''MeasuringWorth'', 2010, "Purchasing Power of British Pounds from 1264 to Present".

Milton followed up the publication ''Paradise Lost'' with its sequel ''[[Paradise Regained]]'', which was published alongside the tragedy ''[[Samson Agonistes]]'' in 1671. Both of these works also reflect Milton's post-Restoration political situation. Just before his death in 1674, Milton supervised a second edition of ''Paradise Lost'', accompanied by an explanation of "why the poem rhymes not", and prefatory verses by [[Andrew Marvell]]. In 1673, Milton republished his ''1645 Poems'', as well as a collection of his letters and the Latin [[prolusion]]s from his Cambridge days.

==Views==
An unfinished religious manifesto, ''[[De Doctrina Christiana (Milton)|De doctrina christiana]]'', probably written by Milton, lays out many of his heterodox theological views, and was not discovered and published until 1823. Milton's key beliefs were idiosyncratic, not those of an identifiable group or faction, and often they go well beyond the orthodoxy of the time. Their tone, however, stemmed from the Puritan emphasis on the centrality and inviolability of conscience.<ref>See, for instance, Barker, Arthur. ''Milton and the Puritan Dilemma, 1641–1660''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1942: 338 and ''passim''; Wolfe, Don M. ''Milton in the Puritan Revolution''. New York: T. Nelson and Sons, 1941: 19.</ref> He was his own man, but he was anticipated by [[Henry Robinson (writer)|Henry Robinson]] in ''Areopagitica''.{{clarify|Areopagitica was written by Milton, not Robinson|date=April 2016}}

===Philosophy===
While Milton's beliefs are generally considered to be consistent with Protestant Christianity, Stephen Fallon argues that by the late 1650s, Milton may have at least toyed with the idea of [[monism]] or animist materialism, the notion that a single material substance which is "animate, self-active, and free" composes everything in the universe: from stones and trees and bodies to minds, souls, angels, and God.<ref>Stephen Fallon, ''Milton Among the Philosophers'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1991), p. 81.</ref>  Fallon claims that Milton devised this position to avoid the [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|mind-body dualism]] of [[Plato]] and [[René Descartes|Descartes]] as well as the [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] [[determinism]] of [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]]. According to Fallon, Milton's monism is most notably reflected in ''Paradise Lost'' when he has angels eat (5.433–39){{clarify|date=May 2012}} and apparently engage in sexual intercourse (8.622–29){{clarify|date=May 2012}} and the ''De Doctrina'', where he denies the dual natures of man and argues for a theory of Creation [[Ex nihilo|''ex Deo'']].

===Political thought===
{{Main|John Milton's politics}}Milton was a "passionately individual Christian Humanist poet."<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=A Critical History of English Literature, Vol. I|last=Daiches|first=David|publisher=Seeker & Warburg|year=1960|location=London|pages=457}}</ref> He appears on the pages of seventeenth century English Puritanism, an age characterized as "the world turned upside down."<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World Turned Upside Down: Radical Ideas During the English Revolution|last=Hill|first=Christopher|publisher=Penguin|year=1984|isbn=9780140137323|location=London}}</ref> He was a Puritan and yet was unwilling to surrender conscience to party positions on public policy. Thus, Milton's political thought, driven by competing convictions, a Reformed faith and a Humanist spirit, led to enigmatic outcomes.<blockquote>Milton’s apparently contradictory stance on the vital problems of his age, arose from religious contestations, to the questions of the divine rights of kings. In both the cases, he seems in control, taking stock of the situation arising from the polarization of the English society on religious and political lines. He fought with the Puritans against the Cavaliers i.e. the King’s party, and helped win the day. But the very same constitutional and republican polity, when tried to curtail freedom of speech, Milton, given his humanistic zeal, wrote ''Areopagitica'' . . .<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Khan|first=Abdul Hamid|date=July–September 2016|title=The Conflict of Puritanism in Milton: An Analysis|url=http://www.qurtuba.edu.pk/thedialogue/The%20Dialogue/11_3/Dialogue_July_September2016_346-357.pdf|journal=The Dialogue|volume=XI|pages=355–356|via=Qurtuba University}}</ref></blockquote>[[File:Areopagitica 1644bw gobeirne.png|thumb|upright|Title page of John Milton's 1644 edition of ''[[Areopagitica]]'']]

Milton's political thought may be best categorized according to respective periods in his life and times. The years 1641–42 were dedicated to church politics and the struggle against episcopacy. After his divorce writings, ''Areopagitica'', and a gap, he wrote in 1649–54 in the aftermath of the [[execution of Charles I]], and in polemic justification of the regicide and the existing Parliamentarian regime. Then in 1659–60 he foresaw the Restoration, and wrote to head it off.<ref>Blair Worden, ''Literature and Politics in Cromwellian England: John Milton, Andrew Marvell and Marchamont Nedham'' (2007), p. 154.</ref>

Milton's own beliefs were in some cases unpopular, particularly his commitment to [[republicanism]]. In coming centuries, Milton would be claimed as an early apostle of liberalism.<ref>''Milton and Republicanism'', ed. David Armitage, Armand Himy, and Quentin Skinner (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995).</ref> According to James Tully:

{{quote|... with [[John Locke|Locke]] as with Milton, republican and [[Social contract|contraction]] conceptions of political freedom join hands in common opposition to the disengaged and passive subjection offered by [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutists]] such as [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]] and [[Robert Filmer]].<ref>James Tully, ''An Approach to Political Philosophy: Locke in Contexts'' (1993), p. 301.</ref>}}

A friend and ally in the pamphlet wars was [[Marchamont Nedham]]. [[Austin Woolrych]] considers that although they were quite close, there is "little real affinity, beyond a broad republicanism", between their approaches.<ref>[[Austin Woolrych]], ''Commonwealth to Protectorate'' (1982), p. 34.</ref> [[Blair Worden]] remarks that both Milton and Nedham, with others such as [[Andrew Marvell]] and [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], would have taken their problem with the [[Rump Parliament]] to be not the republic itself, but the fact that it was not a proper republic.<ref>Worden p. 149.</ref> Woolrych speaks of "the gulf between Milton's vision of the Commonwealth's future and the reality".<ref>Austin Woolrych, ''Commonwealth to Protectorate'' (1982), p. 101.</ref> In the early version of his ''[[History of Britain (John Milton)|History of Britain]]'', begun in 1649, Milton was already writing off the members of the [[Long Parliament]] as incorrigible.<ref>[[G. E. Aylmer]] (editor), ''The Interregnum: The Quest for Settlement 1646–1660'' (1972), p. 17.</ref>

He praised [[Oliver Cromwell]] as the Protectorate was set up; though subsequently he had major reservations. When Cromwell seemed to be backsliding as a revolutionary, after a couple of years in power, Milton moved closer to the position of [[Henry Vane the Younger|Sir Henry Vane]], to whom he wrote a sonnet in 1652.<ref>Christopher Hill, ''God's Englishman'' (1972 edition), p. 200.</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=To S r Henry Vane the younger. – The Poetical Works of John Milton}}</ref> The group of disaffected republicans included, besides Vane, [[John Bradshaw (judge)|John Bradshaw]], [[John Hutchinson (Colonel)|John Hutchinson]], [[Edmund Ludlow]], [[Henry Marten (regicide)|Henry Marten]], [[Robert Overton]], [[Edward Sexby]] and [[John Streater]]; but not Marvell, who remained with Cromwell's party.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/milton_quarterly/v034/34.1creaser.html#FOOT36 |title=John W.

As [[Richard Cromwell]] fell from power, he envisaged a step towards a freer republic or "free commonwealth", writing in the hope of this outcome in early 1660. Milton had argued for an awkward position, in the ''[[The Ready and Easy Way to Establish a Free Commonwealth|Ready and Easy Way]]'', because he wanted to invoke the [[Good Old Cause]] and gain the support of the republicans, but without offering a democratic solution of any kind.<ref>Blair Worden, ''Literature and Politics in Cromwellian England: John Milton, Andrew Marvell and Marchamont Nedham'' (2007), Ch. 14, ''Milton and the Good Old Cause''.</ref> His proposal, backed by reference (amongst other reasons) to the [[oligarchical]] Dutch and Venetian constitutions, was for a council with perpetual membership. This attitude cut right across the grain of popular opinion of the time, which swung decisively behind the restoration of the Stuart monarchy that took place later in the year.<ref>Austin Woolrych, Last Quest for Settlement 1657–1660, p. 202, in G. E. Aylmer (editor), The Interregnum: The Quest for Settlement 1646–1660 (1972), p. 17.</ref> Milton, an associate of and advocate on behalf of the regicides, was silenced on political matters as Charles II returned.

===Theology===
{{Main|John Milton's religion}}
Milton was neither a clergyman nor a theologian; however, theology, and particularly English Calvinism, formed the palette on which John Milton created his greatest thoughts.  John Milton wrestled with the great doctrines of the Church amidst the theological crosswinds of his age. The great poet was undoubtedly Reformed (though his grandfather, Richard "the Ranger" Milton had been Roman Catholic).<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|title=The Arms of the Family: The Significance of John Milton's Relatives and Associates|last=Shawcross|first=John T.|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|year=2004|isbn=978-0813122915|location=Lexington|pages=7}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite book|title=In the Days of Milton|url=https://archive.org/details/indaysofmilton00tudo|last=Jenks|first=Tudor|publisher=A.S. Barnes & Company|year=1905|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/indaysofmilton00tudo/page/35 35]–36}}</ref> However, Milton's Calvinism had to find expression in a broad-spirited Humanism. Like many [[Renaissance]] artists before him, Milton attempted to integrate Christian theology with classical modes. In his early poems, the poet narrator expresses a tension between vice and virtue, the latter invariably related to Protestantism. In ''Comus'', Milton may make ironic use of the [[Charles I of England|Caroline]] court [[masque]] by elevating notions of purity and virtue over the conventions of court revelry and superstition. In his later poems, Milton's theological concerns become more explicit.

His use of biblical citation was wide-ranging; Harris Fletcher, standing at the beginning of the intensification of the study of the use of scripture in Milton's work (poetry and prose, in all languages Milton mastered), notes that typically Milton clipped and adapted biblical quotations to suit the purpose, giving precise chapter and verse only in texts for a more specialized readership. As for the plenitude of Milton's quotations from scripture, Fletcher comments, "For this work, I have in all actually collated about twenty-five hundred of the five to ten thousand direct Biblical quotations which appear therein".<ref name=harris/> Milton's customary English Bible was the [[King James Version#Authorized Version|Authorized King James]].<ref>{{cite journal|first=E. C.|last=Baldwin|title=The Authorized Version's Influence Upon Milton's Diction|journal=[[Modern Language Notes]]|volume=xxxvi|issue=6|pages=376–7|doi=10.2307/2914990|jstor=2914990|year=1921}}</ref> When citing and writing in other languages, he usually employed the Latin translation by [[Immanuel Tremellius]], though "he was equipped to read the Bible in Latin, in Greek, and in Hebrew, including the Targumim or Aramaic paraphrases of the Old Testament, and the Syriac version of the New, together with the available commentaries of those several versions".<ref name=harris>{{cite journal|title=Milton's Use of Biblical Quotations|first=-Harris|last=Fletcher|jstor=27703025|journal=[[The Journal of English and Germanic Philology]]|volume=26|issue=2|year=1927|pages=145–165}}</ref>

Milton embraced many heterodox Christian theological views. He has been accused of rejecting the [[Trinity]], believing instead that the Son was subordinate to the Father, a position known as [[Arianism]]; and his sympathy or curiosity was probably engaged by [[Socinianism]]: in August 1650 he licensed for publication by [[William Dugard]] the ''[[Racovian Catechism]]'', based on a non-trinitarian creed.<ref>Lewalski, ''Life of Milton'', p. 253.</ref><ref>William Bridges Hunter, ''A Milton Encyclopedia'' (1980), Vol. VIII, p. 13.</ref> Milton's alleged Arianism, like much of his theology, is still subject of debate and controversy. [[Rufus Wilmot Griswold]] argued that "In none of his great works is there a passage from which it can be inferred that he was an Arian; and in the very last of his writings he declares that "the doctrine of the Trinity is a plain doctrine in Scripture."<ref>John Milton, The Prose Works of John Milton: With a Biographical Introduction by Rufus Wilmot Griswold. In Two Volumes (Philadelphia: John W. Moore, 1847). Vol. 1. [[wikisource:The Prose Works of John Milton/Biographical introduction|The Prose Works of John Milton, Biographical introduction]]</ref> In ''Areopagitica,'' Milton classified Arians and Socinians as "errorists" and "schismatics" alongside [[Arminians]] and [[Anabaptists]].<ref>W.F.

In his 1641 treatise, ''[[Of Reformation]]'', Milton expressed his dislike for Catholicism and episcopacy, presenting Rome as a modern [[Babylon]], and bishops as Egyptian taskmasters. These analogies conform to Milton's puritanical preference for [[Old Testament]] imagery. He knew at least four commentaries on ''Genesis'': those of [[John Calvin]], [[Paulus Fagius]], [[David Pareus]] and [[Andreus Rivetus]].<ref>Arnold Williams, ''Renaissance Commentaries on "Genesis" and Some Elements of the Theology of Paradise Lost'', PMLA, Vol. 56, No. 1 (Mar. 1941), pp. 151–64.</ref>

Through the [[Interregnum (1649–1660)|Interregnum]], Milton often presents England, rescued from the trappings of a worldly monarchy, as an [[elect]] nation akin to the Old Testament [[Israel]], and shows its leader, [[Oliver Cromwell]], as a latter-day [[Moses]]. These views were bound up in Protestant views of the [[Millennialism|Millennium]], which some sects, such as the [[Fifth Monarchists]] predicted would arrive in England. Milton, however, would later criticise the "worldly" millenarian views of these and others, and expressed orthodox ideas on the prophecy of the [[Four Empires]].<ref>Walter S. H. Lim, ''John Milton, Radical Politics, and Biblical Republicanism'' (2006), p. 141.</ref>

The Restoration of the Stuart monarchy in 1660 began a new phase in Milton's work. In ''Paradise Lost'', ''[[Paradise Regained]]'' and ''[[Samson Agonistes]]'', Milton mourns the end of the godly [[English Commonwealth|Commonwealth]]. The [[Garden of Eden]] may allegorically reflect Milton's view of England's recent [[The Fall of Man|Fall from Grace]], while [[Samson]]'s blindness and captivity—mirroring Milton's own lost sight—may be a metaphor for England's blind acceptance of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] as king.
Illustrated by ''Paradise Lost'' is [[Soul sleep|mortalism]], the belief that the soul lies dormant after the body dies.<ref>John Rogers, ''The Matter of Revolution'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1998), p. xi.</ref>

Despite the Restoration of the monarchy, Milton did not lose his personal faith; ''Samson'' shows how the loss of national [[salvation]] did not necessarily preclude the salvation of the individual, while ''Paradise Regained'' expresses Milton's continuing belief in the promise of Christian salvation through Jesus Christ.

Though he maintained his personal faith in spite of the defeats suffered by his cause, the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' recounted how he had been alienated from the Church of England by Archbishop William Laud, and then moved similarly from the [[Dissenters]] by their denunciation of religious tolerance in England.

{{quote|Milton had come to stand apart from all sects, though apparently finding the [[Quakers]] most congenial. He never went to any religious services in his later years. When a servant brought back accounts of sermons from [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]] meetings, Milton became so sarcastic that the man at last gave up his place.}}Writing of the enigmatic and often conflicting views of Milton in the Puritan age, David Daiches wrote convincingly,<blockquote>"Christian and Humanist, Protestant, patriot and heir of the golden ages of Greece and Rome, he faced what appeared to him to be the birth-pangs of a new and regenerate England with high excitement and idealistic optimism.”<ref name=":0" /></blockquote>A fair theological summary may be: that John Milton was a Puritan, though his tendency to press further for liberty of conscience, sometimes out of conviction and often out of mere intellectual curiosity, made the great man, at least, a vital if not uncomfortable ally in the broader Puritan movement.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" />

===Religious toleration===
Milton called in the ''[[Areopagitica]]'' for "the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience, above all liberties" to the conflicting Protestant denominations.<ref>Hill, C. Milton and the English Revolution.  Faber & Faber. 1977.  pp. 155–57</ref> According to American historian William Hunter, "Milton argued for [[disestablishment]] as the only effective way of achieving broad [[Religious toleration|toleration]]. Rather than force a man's conscience, government should recognise the persuasive force of the gospel."<ref>Hunter, William Bridges. ''A Milton Encyclopedia, Volume 8'' (East Brunswick, NJ: Associated University Presses, 1980). pp. 71, 72. {{ISBN|0-8387-1841-8}}.</ref>

===Divorce===
{{Main|Milton's divorce tracts}}

Milton wrote ''The Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce'' in 1643, at the beginning of the English Civil War. In August of that year, he presented his thoughts to the [[Westminster Assembly of Divines]], which had been created by the [[Long Parliament]] to bring greater reform to the Church of England. The Assembly convened on 1 July against the will of King Charles I.

Milton's thinking on divorce caused him considerable trouble with the authorities. An orthodox Presbyterian view of the time was that Milton's views on divorce constituted a one-man [[heresy]]:

{{quote|The fervently Presbyterian [[Thomas Edwards (heresiographer)|Edwards]] had included Milton's divorce tracts in his list in ''[[Gangraena]]'' of heretical publications that threatened the religious and moral fabric of the nation; Milton responded by mocking him as "shallow Edwards" in the satirical sonnet "On the New Forcers of Conscience under the Long Parliament", usually dated to the latter half of 1646.<ref>[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/119394388/PDFSTART (PDF) Nicholas McDowell, ''Family Politics; Or, How John Phillips Read His Uncle's Satirical Sonnets'', Milton Quarterly Vol. 42 Issue 1, pp. 1–21. Published online: 17 April 2008.]{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>}}

Even here, though, his originality is qualified: [[Thomas Gataker]] had already identified "mutual solace" as a principal goal in marriage.<ref>[[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]], ''Milton and the English Revolution'' (1977), p. 127.</ref> Milton abandoned his campaign to legitimise divorce after 1645, but he expressed support for [[polygamy]] in the ''[[De Doctrina Christiana (Milton)|De Doctrina Christiana]]'', the theological treatise that provides the clearest evidence for his views.<ref>John Milton, ''The Christian Doctrine'' in ''Complete Poems and Major Prose'', ed.

Milton wrote during a period when thoughts about divorce were anything but simplistic; rather, there was active debate among thinkers and intellectuals at the time. However, Milton's basic approval of divorce within strict parameters set by the biblical witness was typical of many influential Christian intellectuals, particularly the Westminster divines. Milton addressed the Assembly on the matter of divorce in August 1643,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~milton/reading_room/ddd/book_1/notes.shtml |title=Archived copy |access-date=10 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704170506/http://www.dartmouth.edu/~milton/reading_room/ddd/book_1/notes.shtml |archive-date= 4 July 2013 }}</ref> at a moment when the Assembly was beginning to form its opinion on the matter. In the Doctrine & Discipline of Divorce, Milton argued that divorce was a private matter, not a legal or ecclesiastical one. Neither the Assembly nor Parliament condemned Milton or his ideas. In fact, when the Westminster Assembly wrote the Westminster Confession of Faith they allowed for divorce ('Of Marriage and Divorce,' Chapter 24, Section 5) in cases of infidelity or abandonment. Thus, the Christian community, at least a majority within the 'Puritan' sub-set, approved of Milton's views.

Nevertheless, reaction among Puritans to Milton's views on divorce was mixed. [[Herbert Palmer (Puritan)|Herbert Palmer]], a member of the [[Westminster Assembly]], condemned Milton in the strongest possible language:

{{quote|If any plead Conscience ... for divorce for other causes than Christ and His Apostles mention; Of which a wicked booke is abroad and uncensured, though deserving to be burnt, whose Author, hath been so impudent as to set his Name to it, and dedicate it to your selves ... will you grant a Toleration for all this?|The Glasse of God's Providence Towards His Faithfull Ones, 1644, p. 54.<ref>Ernest Sirluck, "Introduction", Complete Prose Works of John Milton, New Haven: Yale U. Press, 1959, II, 103</ref>}}

Palmer expressed his disapproval in a sermon addressed to the Westminster Assembly. The Scottish commissioner Robert Baillie described Palmer's sermon as one "of the most Scottish and free sermons that ever I heard any where."<ref>Baillie, Letters and Journals, Edinburgh, 1841, II, 220.</ref>

===History===
History was particularly important for the political class of the period, and Lewalski considers that Milton "more than most illustrates" a remark of [[Thomas Hobbes]] on the weight placed at the time on the classical Latin historical writers [[Tacitus]], [[Livy]], [[Sallust]] and [[Cicero]], and their republican attitudes.<ref>Lewalski, ''Life of Milton'', p. 199.</ref> Milton himself wrote that "Worthy deeds are not often destitute of worthy relaters", in Book II of his ''History of Britain''. A sense of history mattered greatly to him:<ref>Nicholas Von Maltzahn, ''Milton's History of Britain: republican historiography in the English Revolution'', Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1991</ref>

{{quote|The course of human history, the immediate impact of the civil disorders, and his own traumatic personal life, are all regarded by Milton as typical of the predicament he describes as "the misery that has bin since Adam".<ref>Timothy Kenyon, ''Utopian Communism and Political Thought in Early Modern England'' (1989), p. 34.</ref>}}

==Legacy and influence==
Once ''Paradise Lost'' was published, Milton's stature as epic poet was immediately recognised. He cast a formidable shadow over English poetry in the 18th and 19th centuries; he was often judged equal or superior to all other English poets, including [[Shakespeare]]. Very early on, though, he was championed by [[Whig (British political faction)|Whigs]], and decried by [[Tories]]: with the regicide [[Edmund Ludlow]] he was claimed as an early Whig,<ref>[[Kevin Sharpe (historian)|Kevin Sharpe]], ''Remapping Early Modern England: The Culture of Seventeenth-century Politics'' (2000), p. 7.</ref> while the High Tory Anglican minister [[Luke Milbourne]] lumped Milton in with other "Agents of Darkness" such as [[John Knox]], [[George Buchanan]], [[Richard Baxter]], [[Algernon Sidney]] and [[John Locke]].<ref>[[J. P. Kenyon]], ''Revolution Principles'' (1977), p. 77.</ref> The political ideas of Milton, Locke, Sidney, and [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]] strongly influenced the [[Radical Whigs]], whose ideology in turn was central to the [[American Revolution]].<ref>[[Robert Middlekauff]] (2005), ''The Great Cause: The American Revolution, 1763–1789'', Revised and Expanded Edition, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-531588-2}}, pp. 51, 136ff</ref> Modern scholars of Milton's life, politics, and work are known as Miltonists: "his work is the subject of a very large amount of academic scholarship".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vqronline.org/world-milton-scholarship|title=The World of Milton Scholarship|work=Virginia Quarterly Review|last=Zagorin|first=Perez|year=2002|access-date=11 May 2016}}</ref>

In 2008, John Milton Passage, a short passage by Bread Street into St Mary-le-Bow Churchyard in London, was unveiled.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Forsyth|first=Neil|title=John Milton: A Biography|publisher=Lion Books|year=2008|isbn=978-0745953106|pages=15}}</ref>

===Early reception of the poetry===
[[File:MiltonPoeticalWorksNewton1752-61.jpg|thumb|Title page of a 1752–1761 edition of "The Poetical Works of John Milton with Notes of Various Authors by Thomas Newton" printed by J. & R. Tonson in the Strand]]

[[John Dryden]], an early enthusiast, in 1677 began the trend of describing Milton as the poet of the [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_7014/is_1_16/ai_n28450154/pg_5 |title=Audience and human nature in the poetry of Milton and Dryden/Milton ve Dryden'in siirlerinde izleyici ve insan dogasi – Interactions – Find Articles at BNET |via=Find Articles |access-date=9 December 2008 |first=Hasan A. |last=Al-Zubi |year=2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124090835/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_7014/is_1_16/ai_n28450154/pg_5/ |archive-date=24 January 2011 }}</ref> Dryden's ''The State of Innocence and the Fall of Man: an Opera'' (1677) is evidence of an immediate cultural influence. In 1695, [[Patrick Hume (editor)|Patrick Hume]] became the first editor of ''Paradise Lost'', providing an extensive apparatus of annotation and commentary, particularly chasing down allusions.<ref>Joseph M. Levine, ''The Battle of the Books: History and Literature in the Augustan Age'' (1994), p. 247.</ref>

In 1732, the classical scholar [[Richard Bentley]] offered a corrected version of ''Paradise Lost''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://JackLynch.net/Texts/Bentley/ |title=Online text of one book |publisher=Andromeda.rutgers.edu |access-date=4 January 2010}}</ref> Bentley was considered presumptuous, and was attacked in the following year by [[Zachary Pearce]]. [[Christopher Ricks]] judges that, as critic, Bentley was both acute and wrong-headed, and "incorrigibly eccentric"; [[William Empson]] also finds Pearce to be more sympathetic to Bentley's underlying line of thought than is warranted.<ref>[[Christopher Ricks]], ''Milton's Grand Style'' (1963), pp. 9, 14, 57.</ref><ref>William Empson, ''Some Versions of Pastoral'' (1974 edition), p. 147.</ref>

There was an early, partial translation of ''Paradise Lost'' into German by [[Theodore Haak]], and based on that a standard verse translation by Ernest Gottlieb von Berge. A subsequent prose translation by [[Johann Jakob Bodmer]] was very popular; it influenced Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock. The German-language Milton tradition returned to England in the person of the artist [[Henry Fuseli]].

Many Enlightenment thinkers of the 18th century revered and commented on Milton's poetry and non-poetical works. In addition to John Dryden, among them were [[Alexander Pope]], [[Joseph Addison]], [[Thomas Newton]], and [[Samuel Johnson]]. For example, in ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'',<ref>Nos 267, 273, 279, 285, 291, 297, 303, 309, 315, 321, 327, 333, 339, 345, 351, 357, 363, and 369.</ref> Joseph Addison wrote extensive notes, annotations, and interpretations of certain passages of ''Paradise Lost''. [[Jonathan Richardson (painter)|Jonathan Richardson, senior]], and Jonathan Richardson, the younger, co-wrote a book of criticism.<ref>''Explanatory Notes and Remarks on Milton's Paradise Lost'' (1734).</ref> In 1749, Thomas Newton published an extensive edition of Milton's poetical works with annotations provided by himself, Dryden, Pope, Addison, the Richardsons (father and son) and others. Newton's edition of Milton was a culmination of the honour bestowed upon Milton by early Enlightenment thinkers; it may also have been prompted by Richard Bentley's infamous edition, described above. Samuel Johnson wrote numerous essays on ''Paradise Lost'', and Milton was included in his ''[[Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets]]'' (1779–1781). In ''[[The Age of Louis XIV]]'', [[Voltaire]] said "Milton remains the glory and the wonder (''l'admiration'') of England."<ref>Voltaire, ''Le Siecle de Louis XIV 2,'' Paris: Garnier-Flammarion, 1966, p.66.</ref>

===Blake===
[[File:Milton a Poem copy D 1818 Library of Congress object 1.jpg|thumb|[[Frontispiece (book)|Frontispiece]] to ''[[Milton: A Poem in Two Books]]'']]

[[William Blake]] considered Milton the major English poet. Blake placed [[Edmund Spenser]] as Milton's precursor, and saw himself as Milton's poetical son.<ref>[[S. Foster Damon]], ''A Blake Dictionary'' (1973), p. 274.</ref> In his ''[[Milton: A Poem in Two Books]]'', Blake uses Milton as a character.

===Romantic theory===
[[Edmund Burke]] was a theorist of the [[sublime (literary)|sublime]], and he regarded Milton's description of Hell as exemplary of sublimity as an [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] concept. For Burke, it was to set alongside mountain-tops, a storm at sea, and [[infinity]].<ref>Bill Beckley, ''Sticky Sublime'' (2001), p. 63.</ref> In ''The Beautiful and the Sublime'', he wrote: "No person seems better to have understood the secret of heightening, or of setting terrible things, if I may use the expression, in their strongest light, by the force of a judicious obscurity than Milton."<ref>Part II, Section I: [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/b/burke/edmund/sublime/part2.html Adelaide.edu.au] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026004530/http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/b/burke/edmund/sublime/part2.html |date=26 October 2008 }}.</ref>

The [[Romanticism|Romantic poets]] valued his exploration of [[blank verse]], but for the most part rejected his religiosity. [[William Wordsworth]] began his sonnet "London, 1802" with "Milton! thou should'st be living at this hour"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/106/213.html |title=Francis T. Palgrave, ed. (1824–1897). The Golden Treasury. 1875 |publisher=Bartleby.com |access-date=4 January 2010}}</ref> and modelled ''[[The Prelude]]'', his own blank verse epic, on ''Paradise Lost''. [[John Keats]] found the yoke of Milton's style uncongenial;<ref>Thomas N. Corns, ''A Companion to Milton'' (2003), p. 474.</ref> he exclaimed that "Miltonic verse cannot be written but in an artful or rather artist's humour."<ref name=Leader>Leader, Zachary. "Revision and Romantic Authorship". Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999. 298. {{ISBN|0-19-818634-7}}.</ref> Keats felt that ''Paradise Lost'' was a "beautiful and grand curiosity", but his own unfinished attempt at epic poetry, ''[[Hyperion (poem)|Hyperion]]'', was unsatisfactory to the author because, amongst other things, it had too many "Miltonic inversions".<ref name=Leader/> In ''[[The Madwoman in the Attic]]'', [[Sandra Gilbert]] and [[Susan Gubar]] note that [[Mary Shelley]]'s novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' is, in the view of many critics, "one of the key 'Romantic' readings of ''Paradise Lost''."<ref>Cited from the original in J. Paul Hunter (editor), ''Frankenstein'' by Mary Shelley (1996), p. 225.</ref>

===Later legacy===
The Victorian age witnessed a continuation of Milton's influence, [[George Eliot]]<ref>Nardo, Anna K. ''George Eliot's Dialogue with Milton''.</ref> and [[Thomas Hardy]] being particularly inspired by Milton's poetry and biography. Hostile 20th-century criticism by [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Ezra Pound]] did not reduce Milton's stature.<ref>[[Göran Printz-Påhlson|Printz-Påhlson, Göran]]. ''Letters of Blood and Other Works in English''. [https://books.google.com/books?id=fwKQDp8aLyMC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false] pp. 10–14</ref> [[F. R. Leavis]], in ''The Common Pursuit'', responded to the points made by Eliot, in particular the claim that "the study of Milton could be of no help: it was only a hindrance", by arguing, "As if it were a matter of deciding ''not'' to study Milton! The problem, rather, was to escape from an influence that was so difficult to escape from because it was unrecognized, belonging, as it did, to the climate of the habitual and 'natural'."<ref>Leavis, F. R. ''The Common Pursuit''. https://books.google.com/books?id=9Yl1ax4_hukC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false</ref> [[Harold Bloom]], in ''[[The Anxiety of Influence]]'', wrote that "Milton is the central problem in any theory and history of poetic influence in English [...]".<ref>[[Harold Bloom]], ''The Anxiety of Influence: A theory of poetry'' (1997), p. 33.</ref>

Milton's ''[[Areopagitica]]'' is still cited as relevant to the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/ideasv42/blasi4.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214064554/http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/ideasv42/blasi4.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 December 2007 |title=Milton's Areopagitica and the Modern First Amendment by Vincent Blasi |publisher=Nationalhumanitiescenter.org |access-date=4 January 2010 }}</ref> A quotation from ''Areopagitica''—"A good book is the precious lifeblood of a master spirit, embalmed and treasured up on purpose to a life beyond life"—is displayed in many public libraries, including the [[New York Public Library]].

The title of [[Philip Pullman]]'s ''[[His Dark Materials]]'' trilogy is derived from a quotation, "His dark materials to create more worlds", line 915 of Book II in ''Paradise Lost''. Pullman was concerned to produce a version of Milton's poem accessible to teenagers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christs.cam.ac.uk/darknessvisible/imitation.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201090937/http://www.christs.cam.ac.uk/darknessvisible/imitation.html |url-status=dead |archive-date= 1 February 2008 |title=Imitating Milton: The Legacy of Paradise Lost |publisher=University of Cambridge |access-date=4 January 2010 }}</ref> and has spoken of Milton as "our greatest public poet".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_stories/2007/071217a.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112053907/http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_stories/2007/071217a.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=12 January 2009 |title=Philip Pullman opens Bodleian Milton exhibition|publisher=University of Oxford |access-date=4 January 2010 }}</ref>

Titles of a number of other well-known literary works are also derived from Milton's writings.  Examples include [[Thomas Wolfe]]'s ''[[Look Homeward, Angel]]'', [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Eyeless in Gaza (novel)|Eyeless in Gaza]]'', [[Arthur Koestler]]'s ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'', and [[William Golding]]'s ''[[Darkness Visible (novel)|Darkness Visible]]''.<ref>Rosen, J. "Return to Paradise". ''The New Yorker'', 2 June 2008, pp. 72–6.</ref>

T. S. Eliot believed that "of no other poet is it so difficult to consider the poetry simply as poetry, without our theological and political dispositions... making unlawful entry".<ref>Eliot 1947 p. 63.</ref>

===Literary legacy===

Milton's use of [[blank verse]], in addition to his stylistic innovations (such as grandiloquence of voice and vision, peculiar diction and phraseology) influenced later poets. At the time, poetic blank verse was considered distinct from its use in verse drama, and ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' was taken as a unique examplar.<ref>Saintsbury 1908 ii. 443.</ref> Said [[Isaac Watts]] in 1734, "Mr. Milton is esteemed the parent and author of blank verse among us".<ref>Watts 1810 iv. 619.</ref> "Miltonic verse" might be synonymous for a century with blank verse as poetry, a new poetic terrain independent from both the drama and the [[heroic couplet]].

Lack of rhyme was sometimes taken as Milton's defining innovation. He himself considered the rhymeless quality of ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' to be an extension of his own personal liberty:

{{quote|This neglect then of Rhime&nbsp;... is to be esteem'd an example set, the first in English, of ancient liberty recover'd to heroic Poem from the troublesom and modern bondage of Rimeing.<ref>Milton 1668 xi.</ref>}}

This pursuit of freedom was largely a reaction against conservative values entrenched within the rigid heroic couplet.<ref>Gordon 2008 p. 234.</ref> Within a dominant culture that stressed elegance and finish, he granted primacy to freedom, breadth and imaginative suggestiveness, eventually developed into the romantic vision of sublime terror. Reaction to Milton's poetic worldview included, grudgingly, acknowledgement that of poet's resemblance to classical writers (Greek and Roman poetry being unrhymed). Blank verse came to be a recognised medium for religious works and for translations of the classics. Unrhymed lyrics like [[William Collins (poet)|Collins]]' ''[[Ode to Evening]]'' (in the meter of Milton's translation of [[Horace]]'s ''[[Ode to Pyrrha]]'') were not uncommon after 1740.<ref>Dexter 1922 p. 46.</ref>

A second aspect of Milton's blank verse was the use of unconventional rhythm:

{{quote|His blank-verse paragraph, and his audacious and victorious attempt to combine blank and rhymed verse with paragraphic effect in Lycidas, lay down indestructible models and patterns of English verse-rhythm, as distinguished from the narrower and more strait-laced forms of English metre.<ref>Saintsbury 1908 ii. 457.</ref>}}

Before Milton, "the sense of regular rhythm&nbsp;... had been knocked into the English head so securely that it was part of their nature".<ref>Saintsbury 1916 p. 101.</ref> The "Heroick measure", according to [[Samuel Johnson]], "is pure&nbsp;... when the accent rests upon every second syllable through the whole line&nbsp;... The repetition of this sound or percussion at equal times, is the most complete harmony of which a single verse is capable".<ref>Johnson 1751 no. 86.</ref> [[Caesura]]l pauses, most agreed, were best placed at the middle and the end of the line. In order to support this symmetry, lines were most often octo- or deca-syllabic, with no [[enjambed]] endings. To this schema Milton introduced modifications, which included [[hypermetric]]al [[syllable]]s (trisyllabic [[Foot (prosody)|feet]]), [[inversion (prosody)|inversion]] or slighting of [[stress (linguistics)|stresses]], and the shifting of pauses to all parts of the line.<ref>Dexter 1922 p. 57.</ref> Milton deemed these features to be reflective of "the transcendental union of order and freedom".<ref>Saintsbury 1908 ii. 458–59.</ref> Admirers remained hesitant to adopt such departures from traditional metrical schemes: "The English&nbsp;... had been writing separate lines for so long that they could not rid themselves of the habit".<ref>Dexter 1922 p. 59.</ref> Isaac Watts preferred his lines distinct from each other, as did [[Oliver Goldsmith]], [[Henry Pemberton]], and [[Scott of Amwell]], whose general opinion it was that Milton's frequent omission of the initial unaccented foot was "displeasing to a nice ear".<ref>Saintsbury 1916 p. 114.</ref> It was not until the late 18th century that poets (beginning with [[Thomas Gray|Gray]]) began to appreciate "the composition of Milton's harmony&nbsp;... how he loved to vary his pauses, his measures, and his feet, which gives that enchanting air of freedom and wilderness to his versification".<ref>Gray 1748 ''Observations on English Metre''.</ref> By the 20th century, American poet and critic John Hollander would go so far as to say that Milton "was able, by plying that most remarkable instrument of English meter ... to invent a new mode of image-making in English poetry."<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/visionresonancet0000holl/page/116|title=Vision and resonance : two senses of poetic form|last=Hollander|first=John|date=1975|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-501898-2|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/visionresonancet0000holl/page/116 116]|oclc=1530446}}</ref>

Milton's pursuit of liberty extended into his vocabulary as well. It included many Latinate [[neologism]]s, as well as obsolete words already dropped from popular usage so completely that their meanings were no longer understood. In 1740, [[Francis Peck]] identified some examples of Milton's "old" words (now popular).<ref>They included "self-same", "hue", "minstrelsy", "murky", "carol", and "chaunt". Among Milton's naturalized Latin words were "humid", "orient", "hostil", "facil", "fervid", "jubilant", "ire", "bland", "reluctant", "palpable", "fragil", and "ornate". Peck 1740 pp. 110–11.</ref> The "Miltonian dialect", as it was called, was emulated by later poets; Pope used the diction of ''Paradise Lost'' in his [[Homer]] translation, while the lyric poetry of Gray and Collins was frequently criticised for their use of "obsolete words out of Spenser and Milton".<ref>Scott 1785 63.</ref> The language of [[James Thomson (poet)|Thomson]]'s finest poems (e.g. ''[[The Seasons (Thomson poem)|The Seasons]]'', ''[[The Castle of Indolence]]'') was self-consciously modelled after the Miltonian dialect, with the same tone and sensibilities as ''Paradise Lost''. Following to Milton, English poetry from Pope to [[John Keats]] exhibited a steadily increasing attention to the connotative, the imaginative and poetic, value of words.<ref>Saintsbury 1908 ii. 468.</ref>

===Musical settings===

Milton's [[ode]] ''At a solemn Musick'' was set for choir and orchestra as ''[[Blest Pair of Sirens]]'' by [[Hubert Parry]] (1848–1918), and Milton's poem ''On the Morning of Christ's Nativity'' was set as a large-scale choral work by [[Cyril Rootham]] (1875–1938). Milton also wrote the hymn [[Let us with a gladsome mind]], a versification of Psalm 136. His 'L'Allegro' and 'Il Penseroso', with additional material, were magnificently set by Handel (1740).
