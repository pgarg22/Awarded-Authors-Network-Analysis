It imagines the writing of Lemprière's dictionary as tied to the founding of the [[British East India Company]] and the [[Siege of La Rochelle]] generations before; it also visits the [[Austro-Turkish War (1787–1791)|Austro-Turkish War]].

Norfolk based his second novel, ''The Pope's Rhinoceros'', on the story of an actual animal; see [[Dürer's Rhinoceros]]. Themes in the work  include the lost city of [[Vineta]] in the Baltic, the sack of [[Prato]], and the [[Benin bronzes|Benin bronze]]-making culture on the [[Niger River|river Niger]].

The third novel, ''In the Shape of a Boar'', juxtaposes the flight of a [[Bukovina]] Jew in World War II with the legend of [[Atalanta]] in [[Calydon]].
