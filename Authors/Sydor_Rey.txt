'''Sydor Rey''' born Izydor Reiss (6 September 1908 – 15 November 1979) was a [[Polish literature|Polish]] poet and novelist. During [[Polish culture in the Interbellum|the Interbellum]] he worked in the [[Korczak's orphanages|Jewish orphanage]] of [[Janusz Korczak]] in [[Warsaw]].<ref>Cf. The ''Interia Encyklopedia'' [http://encyklopedia.interia.pl/haslo?hid=99565&kid=77 online.]</ref> He dedicated his short story ''[[#Księga rozbitków installments|Anioł-Stróż]]'' ("Guardian Angel"; 1957), part of his book ''[[#Novels|Księga rozbitków]]'', to the memory of Janusz Korczak.<ref>Sydor Rey, ''Guardian Angel: A Story'', tr. N.&nbsp;Guterman, ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'', vol.&nbsp;67, No.&nbsp;2, February 1979, p.&nbsp;58: [http://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/guardian-angel/ see online.] The story won the acclaim of readers: cf. Jan Leszcza, "Pochwała" (A Commendation), letter to the editor, ''Wiadomości: tygodnik'' (London), vol.&nbsp;12, No.&nbsp;2 (615), 12 January 1958, p.&nbsp;4.</ref> A bisexual author, Sydor Rey did not frequently tackle gay subjects in his writings.<ref name="Shulim" />

==Life in interwar Poland==
Sydor Rey was born in [[Wojniłów]] (now Voinyliv, Ukraine). He studied law and political science at the [[Lvov University]] and at [[Warsaw University]].  As a writer, Rey debuted in 1929.  He was a member of the literary collective (''zespół literacki'') ''Przedmieście'' in Warsaw.<ref>Jerzy Kwiatkowski, ''Literatura Dwudziestolecia'', [[Warsaw]], Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe (Instytut Badań Literackich Polskiej Akademii Nauk), 1990, p.&nbsp;31.  {{ISBN|8301099283}}.</ref> The first issue of the group's [[literary magazine|literary journal]] indicated that the association was established on the initiative of Helena Boguszewska (1886{{ndash}}1978) and Jerzy Kornacki (1908{{ndash}}1981) in June{{ndash}}July 1933, with [[Bruno Schulz]], [[Adolf Rudnicki]], and [[Zofia Nałkowska|Zofja Nałkowska]] among the invited founder members.  Rudnicki had resigned from membership before the publication of their magazine in 1934, while [[Halina Krahelska]] and Sydor Rey were inducted as new members.<ref name="organ">[[Halina Krahelska]], "Przedmowa" (Foreword); in: ''Przedmieście'', ed. H.&nbsp;Boguszewska & J.&nbsp;Kornacki, [[Warsaw]], Towarzystwo Wydawnicze Rój, 1934, p.&nbsp;v.  See also [[:pl:Zespół Literacki Przedmieście|Zespół Literacki Przedmieście]].</ref>

The group's name (''przedmieście'', ''[[Polish language|Pol.]]'' "[[faubourg]]") has been explained as referring both to the group's programmatic preoccupation with the marginalized aspects of the culture and social life in the [[Second Polish Republic]], and to the connotation of "outpost" – hence by extension ''[[avant-garde]]''.<ref name="organ" /> The volume carried Sydor Rey's short story ''Królestwo Boże'' ("The Kingdom of God"), a fictional narrative of a visit to a privately owned factory by a friend of the proprietors. The visit becomes an occasion for remarkably detailed observations on the [[work conditions]] of the employees and their [[Industrial relations|relations with the management]], the government (represented by an industrial inspector), and the outside world.<ref>Sydor Rey, ''Królestwo Boże''; in: ''Przedmieście'', ed. H.&nbsp;Boguszewska & J.&nbsp;Kornacki, [[Warsaw]], Towarzystwo Wydawnicze Rój, 1934, pp.&nbsp;158{{ndash}}177.</ref>

===First novel ''Kropiwniki''===
Sydor Rey's first novel ''Kropiwniki'' was published in 1937.<ref>Sydor Rey, ''Kropiwniki: powieść'', Warsaw, Nakładem Księgarni F.&nbsp;Hoesicka, 1937. (393&nbsp;pp.)</ref>  The title of the novel, ''Kropiwniki'', refers to the Polish provincial locality of Kropiwniki in the [[Volhynia]] (96 kilometres to the north of the Polish town of [[Włodzimierz Wołyński]]; since 1945 within the territory of the [[Ukrainian SSR]]), whose name the author uses as a [[code name|cryptonym]] for his native [[Wojniłów]], an ancient township founded in 1552 by the charter issued by [[Sigismund II Augustus]].<ref>Cf. Ludwik Dziedzicki, in: ''[[Geographical Dictionary of the Kingdom of Poland|The Geographical Dictionary of the Kingdom of Poland]]'', vol.&nbsp;13, p.&nbsp;754, col.&nbsp;2, ''[[s.v.]]'' [[Wojniłów]] [http://dir.icm.edu.pl/pl/Slownik_geograficzny/Tom_XIII/754 (see online).]</ref> Its real identity thus concealed, the place serves as a canvas on which the author paints the history of three generations of inhabitants from various social classes and religious communities of Polish society, including [[Poles]], [[Jews]], and [[Ukrainians]], representatives of the [[szlachta]] but also peasants, merchants, and artisans, thereby presenting an allegory on Polish society as a whole.<ref name="CzS">[Anonymous], "Na ekranie, scenie i wśród książek: Sidor Rey – ''Kropiwniki''" (On the Screen, On the Stage, and Among the Books: Sidor [''[[sic]]''] Rey {{mdash}} ''Kropiwniki''), ''Czasopismo Skarbowe'' (Warsaw), vol.&nbsp;12, No.&nbsp;14, 15 July 1937, p.&nbsp;3.</ref> Each of these various social groups, further subdivided in the book into additional subgroups and subtypes, espouses different and often conflicting sets of beliefs concerning social and political matters, whose beliefs moreover further mutate from generation to generation.<ref name="CzS" /> While the author parades a plethora of various types of characters on his stage, from the szlachta individuals affecting a grand aristocratic manner, through lordlings enlightened by foreign studies enough to be able to fraternize with the working classes, to well-to-do Jewish businessmen, he devotes most space to the radicalizing poverty of the township and the impenetrable ignorance of the peasant masses of the surrounding villages, succeeding to depict this broad gallery of human types in particularly vivid brush strokes of great directness.<ref name="CzS" /> Owing however to the well-nigh unmanageable breadth of the scope of his project, it has been observed by contemporary critics that the social doctrine on occasion takes precedence in his writing over art.<ref name="CzS" /> The author [[Jerzy Andrzejewski]] (1909{{ndash}}1983) in [[literary magazine]] ''Prosto z mostu'',<ref>Cf. [[Ignacy Fik]], ''20 lat literatury polskiej (1918{{ndash}}1938)'', Kraków, Spółdzielnia Wydawnicza Czytelnik, 1939, p.&nbsp;58.</ref> was even less kind, having seen in ''Kropiwniki'' an expression of the alleged Communist stance of an author squandering his talent in a doctrinaire enterprise of quixotic futility.<ref>[[Jerzy Andrzejewski]], "Nowe powieści: Sydor Rey, ''Kropiwniki''" (New Novels: Sydor Rey, ''Kropiwniki''), ''Prosto z mostu'' (Warsaw), vol.&nbsp;3, No.&nbsp;2 (110), 10 January 1937, p.&nbsp;7.</ref>  [[Witold Gombrowicz]] too wrote a detailed and perhaps most considerate analysis of ''Kropiwniki'', arguing that it is the literary debuts that are more interesting, for all their inchoate form, than an author's later works which, though benefiting from the writer's more crystallized pattern of thought, in general tend to say little that is essentially new.<ref>[[Witold Gombrowicz]], "Proletariacka huśtawka" (A Proletarian See-saw); in ''Czytelnicy i krytycy: proza, reportaże, krytyka literacka, eseje, przedmowy'', ed. W.&nbsp;Bolecki, [[Cracow]], Wydawnictwo Literackie, 2004, p.&nbsp;220.  {{ISBN|8308033954}}.</ref>

Rey also translated from the [[Yiddish]] into [[Polish language|Polish]] the [[biographical novel]] on [[Karl Marx]], ''Karl Marks (bay zayn shvel): byografisher montazsh-roman'' by the Polish writer [[Moisheh Grosman]] (1904{{ndash}}1961).<ref>[[Moisheh Grosman|M.

Biographer Eugenia Prokop-Janiec of [[Jagiellonian University]] asserts that it was ultimately the pervasive [[antisemitism]] of the Polish society in the 1930s that forced the writers and poets like Sydor Rey and [[Henryka Łazowertówna]] (1909{{ndash}}1942), who never otherwise identified themselves as Jewish while working in the [[Polish language]], to align themselves with the Jewish community for the first time.<ref>Eugenia Prokop-Janiec, ''Polish{{ndash}}Jewish Literature in the Interwar Years'', tr. A.&nbsp;Shenitzer, [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse (New York)]], Syracuse University Press, 2003, pp.&nbsp;94{{ndash}}95. {{ISBN|0815629842}}.</ref> Sydor Rey's [[Vignette (literature)|vignette]] entitled ''Spacer'' ("A Walk") deals with the thorny subject of [[race relations]] in a [[homoerotic]] context.  It is a short text about a male couple who, taking a stroll in a public park, attract the attention of a gathering crowd not for being gay but for being of different races: the bystanders are not hostile to both characters as a couple, but in each case only to one of them – selected according to the particular bystander's ''own'' racial allegiance: the Gentiles in the crowd of onlookers are hostile to the man who looks Jewish, for they believe him to be somehow exploitative of his companion; the Jews in the crowd on the other hand are hostile to the Gentile believing him to be about to cause harm to his Jewish companion to whom they consequently feel obliged to offer assistance.  Both men offer explanations to a policeman who arrives on the scene to institute ''ad hoc'' inquiry of his own into the commingling of the couple.  The story is an [[allegory]] on the impossibility of normal relations between the races on a private level without public or official harassment, even as relations between (or within) the sexes are tolerated.<ref>Sydor Rey, ''Spacer'' ("A Walk"), ''[[Nowy Głos]]'' (a [[daily newspaper|daily]] Jewish newspaper of [[Warsaw]]), vol.&nbsp;2, No.&nbsp;155, 5 June 1938, p.&nbsp;7.</ref> A bisexual author, Sydor Rey did not frequently tackle gay subjects in his writings.<ref name="Shulim">Cf. Sydor Rey, ''Shulim: A Story'', ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'', vol.&nbsp;29, No.&nbsp;4, April 1960, p.&nbsp;324 [http://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/shulima-story/ (see online).]</ref> His epigram "Na plaży" (On the Beach) is one of the exceptions.<ref>Sydor Rey, "Na plaży" (On the Beach); in ''[[id.]]'', ''Własnymi słowami'', London, Poets' & Painters' Press, 1967, p.&nbsp;49.</ref>

Rey was one of the signatories of the [[open letter]] of the Polish writers against the bloody pacification by the Polish police of the workers' protests against the [[Sanacja]] régime in March 1936.<ref>"Protest pisarzy warszawskich" (Protest of the Writers of Warsaw), ''Kamena: miesięcznik literacki'' ([[Chełm|Chełm Lubelski]]), vol.&nbsp;3, Nos.&nbsp;8{{ndash}}9 (28{{ndash}}29), April{{ndash}}May 1936, back cover.</ref>

==Emigration==
On the eve of the [[Second World War]], in the spring of 1939 Sydor Rey emigrated from Warsaw to New York City, where he subsequently operated a [[second-hand bookshop]].<ref>Bio on the Onet.pl WIEM reference portal (see [http://portalwiedzy.onet.pl/21339,,,,rey_sydor,haslo.html online.)]</ref> His wife and daughter left behind in Poland perished in [[Cracow]] during the [[Holocaust]].<ref>[[Zofia Kozarynowa]], "O ''Księdze rozbitków''", ''Wiadomości: tygodnik'' (London), vol.&nbsp;14, No.&nbsp;48 (713), 29 November 1959, p.&nbsp;4.</ref>  During his American period his writings appeared frequently in the Polish-language [[weekly newspaper]] ''Wiadomości: tygodnik'' ("The News: A Weekly") published in London, and in other [[émigré]] periodicals (while ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' and the ''[[Transatlantic Review (1959)|Transatlantic Review]]'' published translations in the United States). In his reply to a survey of Polish writers living in exile conducted by the ''Wiadomości'' of London in 1958, nearly twenty years after his departure from Poland, Rey revealed that every writer creatively active in exile is ''spiritually present'', in the act of creation, in his native land.<ref name="WTPoll">"Pisarze emigracyjni a literatura krajowa: ankieta ''Wiadomości''" ([[Émigré]] Writers ''vis-à-vis'' the Literature of the Home Country: A ''Wiadomości'' Poll), ''Wiadomości: tygodnik'' (London), vol.&nbsp;13, No.&nbsp;33 (646), 17 August 1958, p.&nbsp;4.</ref>  Hence there are in reality no "émigré writers" and no "émigré literatures".<ref name="WTPoll" />  He appended his literary testament with the following codicil.
<blockquote>
If I, after well-nigh twenty years spent in the United States, have never thought for a moment of adopting English as my creative medium, it is because spiritually I continue to reside in my [[Second Polish Republic|Homeland]].  The split involved here at times invests the written word of an author in exile with a terrifying beauty, which flows from his undaunted vision.  But at the same time this split can, in the long run, lead to the degeneration of the creative faculty {{mdash}} the most glaring case in point being that of the giant of Polish literature, [[Adam Mickiewicz]].  (...) [This happens] when a writer ceases to use the written word in the service of Beauty, as a building block in the project of constructing his own immaterial world, and starts using it as a magic charm invoked for the sake of transforming his immaterial world into a material one.<ref name="WTPoll" />
</blockquote>

And Rey clearly remained devoted to the Polish language for life, in the sort of intricate way of an impeccable stylist, as evidenced in his corrections of the minutiae in the prose of other writers or in the praise he generously showered on the dextrous use of the language in other cases, even of those who might not have been professional writers.<ref>Sydor Rey, "Przyjemniejszy szmer" (A Still More Captivating Murmur), letter to the editor, ''Wiadomości: tygodnik'' (London), vol.&nbsp;14, No.&nbsp;32 (697), 9 August 1959, p.&nbsp;6.  Sydor Rey, "Pisarze nie zawodowi" (Non-professional Writers), letter to the editor, ''Wiadomości: tygodnik'' (London), vol.&nbsp;14, No.&nbsp;46 (711), 15 November 1959, p.&nbsp;6.  Cf. Sydor Rey, "Para Mistrzów" (Two Masters), letter to the editor, ''Wiadomości: tygodnik'' (London), vol.&nbsp;16, No.&nbsp;20 (789), 14 May 1961, p.&nbsp;6.</ref> He was listed by the ''Wiadomości'' of London among the Polish writers in exile who ought to be members of the Polish Academy of Literature were such an institution to be established (or rather [[Polish Academy of Literature|revived]]).<ref>"Rozstrzygnięcie plebiscytu czytelników ''Wiadomości'': kogo wybraliśmy do złożonej z 15 pisarzy emigracyjnej Akademii Literatury Polskiej gdyby taka Akademia powstała" (The Results of ''Wiadomości'' Readers' Plebiscite: Whom to Appoint to the 15-member Polish Academy of Literature in exile were such an Academy to be Established), ''Wiadomości: tygodnik'' (London), vol.&nbsp;14, No.&nbsp;41 (706), 11 October 1959, p.&nbsp;1.</ref>  There is no evidence, on the other hand, that in the United States Rey found anything like a substitute for the land of his youth; in a poem entitled "Miasto na Long Island" (A City on Long Island) published in 1960 he speaks of a "city flat and straight like a cadaver", with street names invoking "[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] that have been exterminated, running streams that have been filled in, hills that have been levelled down, and forests that have been felled": what use to me this cemetery? he asks.  "Don't you know that I was born in a land where a [[Pegasus|white-winged horse]] would bend down to peer into my crib?"<ref>Sydor Rey, "Miasto na Long Island" (A City on Long Island), ''Wiadomości: tygodnik'' (London), vol.&nbsp;15, No.&nbsp;23 (740), 5 June 1960, p.&nbsp;1.  Subsequently published in: ''[[id.]]'', ''Własnymi słowami'', London, Poets' & Painters' Press, 1967, p.&nbsp;86.</ref> In the poem "Banita" (The Banished One; 1961) Rey speaks of himself as a person deprived of speech, on account of his being "a poet without a land".<ref>Sydor Rey, "Banita" (The Banished One), ''Wiadomości: tygodnik'' (London), vol.&nbsp;16, No.&nbsp;52/53 (821/822), 24{{ndash}}31 December 1961, p.&nbsp;3.</ref>

==Publishing from abroad==
During his exile in the United States he also chose to publish his books {{mdash}} ''Księga rozbitków'' ("The Book of the Shipwrecked"; first edition, 1959)<ref>Sydor Rey, ''Księga rozbitków'', [[Warsaw]], Czytelnik, 1959. (227&nbsp;pp.)</ref> and ''Kropiwniki'' (second edition, 1962)<ref>Sydor Rey, ''Kropiwniki'', 2nd&nbsp;ed., [[Cracow]], Wydawnictwo Literackie, 1962. (253&nbsp;pp.) There is a 140-page difference in the number of pages between this second edition and the first edition of 1937, which ran to 393 pages: it is unclear whether this difference is due to a difference in typesetting styles or to an abridgement of the text (and if the latter should be the case, whether this would have been done by the Author or through an intervention of the censor).</ref> {{mdash}} in the then [[People's Republic of Poland|Communist-controlled Poland]], where their publication would have been subject to (and has received) the advance approval of the [[Censorship in the People's Republic of Poland|censors]].  He also granted an interview to the [[Polish Radio]] in 1963, apparently on a visit to Warsaw (see [[#Recordings|Recordings]]).{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

''Księga rozbitków'' ("The Book of the Shipwrecked") is a collection of eighteen short stories that are, cumulatively, a psychological memoir of an author guilt-stricken for having passed the [[Holocaust]] in the physical safety of New York while being spiritually connected to the event as closely as or perhaps in some cases more closely than some of the victims, making the work something of a cross between a novel and a psychodrama ''cum'' a Gestalt therapy.<ref>Gerald Popiel, "The Memories of an Amputee", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol.&nbsp;7, No.&nbsp;2, Spring 1962, p.&nbsp;105.</ref>

Sydor Rey's novel ''Ludzie miejscowi'' ("The Folk of the Place") was published in installments in the ''Wiadomości'' of London between 1962 and 1966 (see [[#Ludzie miejscowi installments|Works]]).  While his writings in prose were praised for their astute psychological shadowing of characters and deep insights into the human condition, his poetry did not appeal to everyone.  [[Marian Pankowski]], reviewing his collection of poetry ''[[#Poetry monographs|Własnymi słowami]]'' ("In My Own Words"; 1967), refused to apply the label of "poetry" to his verses, arguing that the colloquial and sometimes crude turn of phrase favoured by the author put his epigrams beyond the pale of art, while the consistent unsublimated directness of expression made it impossible to interpret this style as a literary conceit.<ref>[[Marian Pankowski]], "Rzeczywistość nieokrzesana, czyli o wierszach Sydora Reya" (Uncouth Reality, or About the Verses of Sydor Rey), ''Wiadomości: tygodnik'' (London), vol.&nbsp;23, No.&nbsp;39 (1174), 29 September 1968, p.&nbsp;4.</ref>  Rey countered that the criticisms presented by Pankowski were illustrated by tendentiously selected quotations that did not constitute a representative sample and had been taken out of context, and that the overall method of extrapolating judgement of the whole ''oeuvre'' from bits and pieces was absurd, "rather like presenting an audience with the bottom sliver of [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne's]] ''[[The Bathers (Cézanne)|Bathing Women]]'' {{mdash}} the figures cut off at the ankle {{mdash}} and averring this fragment to possess 'some characteristics of Cézanne's painting style', only to dispatch the artist ''[[in toto]]'' with the dictum that 'the rest of his output is much in the same manner'".<ref>Sydor Rey, "W obronie własnej" (In Self-defence), letter to the editor, ''Wiadomości: tygodnik'' (London), vol.&nbsp;23, No.&nbsp;45 (1180), 10 November 1968, p.&nbsp;6.</ref>  Since Rey did not publish essays, his philosophical ideas found expression in his fiction, both in prose and in verse.  Poems that deal directly or (sometimes) veiledly with the principal tenets of the Judaeo-Christian religious doctrine {{mdash}} such as "[[#Selected poetry in periodicals|Bajka]]" (Fairy Tale),<ref>Sydor Rey, "Bajka" (Fairy Tale) ''Wiadomości: tygodnik'' (London), vol.&nbsp;15, No.&nbsp;51/52 (768/769), 18{{ndash}}25 December 1960, p.&nbsp;4.  Subsequently published in: ''[[id.]]'', ''Własnymi słowami'', London, Poets' & Painters' Press, 1967, p.&nbsp;7.</ref> "[[#Selected poetry in periodicals|Ojcze nasz]]" (Our Father),<ref>Sydor Rey, "Ojcze nasz" (Our Father), ''Wiadomości: tygodnik'' (London), vol.&nbsp;16, No.&nbsp;52/53 (821/822), 24{{ndash}}31 December 1961, p.&nbsp;3.  Subsequently published in: ''[[id.]]'', ''Własnymi słowami'', London, Poets' & Painters' Press, 1967, p.&nbsp;8.</ref> or "[[#Selected poetry in periodicals|Raz kozie śmierć]]" (Once a Death Befell a Goat) which quotes (in Hebrew) one of the [[Seven Last Words from the Cross|Seven Last Words]] in the scornful context of a [[Pastoral#Pastoral poetry|pastoral ditty]]<ref>Sydor Rey, "Raz kozie śmierć" (Once a Death Befell a Goat), ''Wiadomości: tygodnik'' (London), vol.&nbsp;12, No.&nbsp;4 (1086), 22 January 1967, p.&nbsp;6.  Subsequently published in: ''[[id.]]'', ''Własnymi słowami'', London, Poets' & Painters' Press, 1967, p.&nbsp;35.</ref> {{mdash}} may offend religious sensibilities, expressive as they are of his deep agnosticism and his radical questioning of the [[truth value]] of that doctrine.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

As a literary critic, Sydor Rey believed that [[Boris Pasternak]]'s novel ''[[Doctor Zhivago (novel)|Doctor Zhivago]]'' was deeply indebted to [[Hemingway]]'s ''[[A Farewell to Arms|A&nbsp;Farewell to Arms]]'', notwithstanding the fact of Hemingway's having been "thick-skinned and effect-driven" as opposed to Pasternak's qualities of fragile intelligence and delicacy.<ref>Sydor Rey, "Pasternak i Hemingway" (Pasternak and Hemingway), letter to the editor, ''Wiadomości: tygodnik'' (London), vol.&nbsp;14, No.&nbsp;9 (674), 1 March 1959, p.&nbsp;6.</ref>  He was an admirer of the works of [[Thornton Wilder]], to whom he dedicated a poem (entitled "[[#Selected poetry in periodicals|Festyn]]" {{mdash}} "A Village Fair"; translated in ''[[The Daily Orange]]'' in 1966 as "Picnic"), acknowledging his indebtedness in the writing of ''[[#Novels|Księga rozbitków]]'' to the style of Wilder's play ''[[Our Town]]''.<ref>[Anonymous], "Kronika: Sydor Rey w zbiorach Syracuse University" (Chronicle: Sydor Rey among the Holdings of the Syracuse University Library), ''Wiadomości: tygodnik'' (London), vol.&nbsp;21, No.&nbsp;21 (1051), 22 May 1966, p.&nbsp;6.</ref>

His collected papers dating from the period between 1940 and 1969 {{mdash}} The Sydor Rey Papers {{mdash}} are preserved in the Special Collections Research Center of the [[Syracuse University Library]] in [[Syracuse, New York]], having been donated to the institution by the Author in 1966.<ref>The Sydor Rey Papers, [[Syracuse University Library]] in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse (New York)]].
