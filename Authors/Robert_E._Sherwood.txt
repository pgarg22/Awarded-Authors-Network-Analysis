'''Robert Emmet Sherwood''' (April 4, 1896 – November 14, 1955) was an American playwright and screenwriter.

==Early life and family==
Born in 1896 in New Rochelle, New York, Robert was a son of Arthur Murray Sherwood, a rich stockbroker, and his wife, the former [[Rosina Emmet Sherwood|Rosina Emmet]], a highly accomplished illustrator and portrait painter known as Rosina E. Sherwood.<ref name="enotes">{{cite web |title=Robert E. Sherwood Biography - eNotes.com |url=https://www.enotes.com/topics/robert-e-sherwood |website=eNotes |access-date=12 January 2019 |language=en}}</ref> His paternal grandmother was [[Mary Elizabeth Wilson Sherwood]], the author and social leader. He was a great-great-grandson of the former [[New York State Attorney General]] [[Thomas Addis Emmet]] and a great-grandnephew of the Irish nationalist [[Robert Emmet]], who was executed for high treason after leading the [[Irish rebellion of 1803]], one of a series of attempts to dislodge [[British rule in Ireland]], in 1803. His relatives also included three other notable American portrait artists: his aunts, [[Lydia Field Emmet]] and [[Jane Emmet de Glehn]], and his first cousin, once removed, [[Ellen Emmet Rand]].
Sherwood was educated at [[Fay School]],<ref name="google">{{cite book|title=Complete Biographical Encyclopedia of Pulitzer Prize Winners 1917 - 2000: Journalists, writers and composers on their way to the coveted awards|author=Fischer, H.D.|date=2002|publisher=De Gruyter|isbn=9783110955743|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ylDePPge4nQC|page=221|access-date=2015-05-15}}</ref> [[Milton Academy]] and then [[Harvard University]].

He fought with the [[Canadian Black Watch#The Great War|Royal Highlanders of Canada, CEF]] in Europe during World War I and was wounded. After his return to the United States, he began working as a movie critic for magazines, including ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' and ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''.<ref name="filmreference">{{cite web |title=Robert E. Sherwood - Writer - Films as Writer:, Publications |url=http://www.filmreference.com/Writers-and-Production-Artists-Sh-Sy/Sherwood-Robert-E.html |website=www.filmreference.com}}</ref> Sherwood's career as a critic in the 1920s is discussed in the 2009 documentary ''[[For the Love of Movies: The Story of American Film Criticism]]''. In this film ''Time'' critic [[Richard Schickel]] discusses, among other topics, how Sherwood was the first New York critic invited to Hollywood by cross-country train to meet the stars and directors.

==Writing career==
Sherwood was one of the original members of the [[Algonquin Round Table]]. He was close friends with [[Dorothy Parker]] and [[Robert Benchley]], who were on the staff of ''Vanity Fair'' with Sherwood when the Round Table began meeting in 1919. Author [[Edna Ferber]] was also a good friend. Sherwood stood {{convert|6|ft|8|in}} tall. Dorothy Parker, who was {{convert|5|ft|4|in}}, once commented that when she, Sherwood, and Robert Benchley ({{convert|6|ft}}) walked down the street together, they resembled "a walking pipe organ." When asked at a party how long he had known Sherwood, Benchley stood on a chair, raised his hand to the ceiling, and said "I knew Bob Sherwood back when he was only this tall."<ref>Wallace, D. ''Capital of the World: A Portrait of New York City in the Roaring Twenties''. Lyons Press (2011), p. 175. {{ISBN|0762770104}}.</ref>

In 1949, comedian [[Groucho Marx]] also commented about Sherwood's height during a filmed radio broadcast of the quiz show ''[[You Bet Your Life]]''.  Groucho, who hosted the popular series, interviewed in one episode American football player Howard Scala, a member of the NFL's [[Green Bay Packers]].  Impressed by Scala's own considerable height, Marx shared the following anecdote with the show's audience:{{quote|Reminds me of Bob Sherwood, the playwright, he's an old friend of mine; and he's six-foot-five and very thin.  I said to him one day 'Bob, what do you say to people when they ask you how the weather is up there?' He said 'I spit in their eye and tell ‘em it's raining.'<ref>[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=50ZaXJst18k "You Bet Your Life #49-13 Unaired test film (Secret word 'Name', never aired on TV)"], episode of ''You Bet Your Life'' originally broadcast on CBS Radio on December 28, 1949.  Full episode available for viewing on [[YouTube]], a subsidiary of [[Alphabet, Inc.]], Mountain View, California. Retrieved August 18, 2017.</ref><ref>Groucho Marx in his anecdote understated Sherwood's true height, which more reliable sources cite was between six feet seven inches and six feet eight inches.</ref>}}

Sherwood's first Broadway play, ''[[The Road to Rome]]'' (1927), a comedy concerning [[Hannibal|Hannibal's]] botched invasion of Rome, introduced one of his favorite [[Theme (literature)|themes]]: the futility of war. Many of his later dramatic works employed variations of this theme, including ''[[Idiot's Delight (play)|Idiot's Delight]]'' (1936), which won Sherwood the first of four [[Pulitzer Prize]]s. According to legend, he once admitted to the gossip columnist [[Lucius Beebe]]: “The trouble with me is that I start with a big message and end up with nothing but good entertainment.”<ref>{{cite book|last=Meserve|first =Walter J.|title =Robert E.

Sherwood was actively engaged with the advocacy for writers' rights within the theatre world. From 1937 to 1939, Sherwood served as the seventh president of the [[Dramatists Guild of America]].

Sherwood's Broadway success soon attracted the attention of Hollywood; he began writing for movies in 1926. While some of his work went uncredited, his films included many adaptations of his plays. He also collaborated with [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]] in writing the screenplay for ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' (1940).

With Europe in the midst of World War II, Sherwood set aside his anti-war stance to support the fight against the [[Third Reich]]. ''[[There Shall Be No Night]]'', his 1940 play about the Soviet Union's invasion of Finland, was produced by the Playwright's Company that he co-founded, and it starred [[Alfred Lunt]], [[Lynn Fontanne]], and [[Montgomery Clift]]. [[Katharine Cornell]] produced and starred in a 1957 TV adaptation on TV.<ref name="paleycenter">{{cite web|url=http://www.paleycenter.org/collection/item/?q=Katharine+Cornell&f=people&c=tv&advanced=1&p=1&item=T78:0158|title=The Paley Center for Media|publisher=paleycenter.org|access-date=2015-05-15}}</ref> Sherwood publicly ridiculed isolationist [[Charles Lindbergh]] as a "[[Nazi]] with a Nazi's Olympian contempt for all democratic processes".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1940/12/12/91592328.html|title=Calls Lindbergh 'a Nazi'|website=timesmachine.nytimes.com|access-date=Jan 10, 2020}}</ref>

During this period Sherwood also served as a speechwriter for President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. He recounted the experience in his book ''Roosevelt and Hopkins: An Intimate History'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/rooseveltandhopk006306mbp|title=ROOSEVELT AND HOPKINS AN INTIMATE HISTORY|date=Jan 10, 1948|publisher=THE UNIVERSAL LIBRARY|access-date=Jan 10, 2020|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> which won the 1949 [[Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography]] and a 1949 [[Bancroft Prize]].<ref>Alonso, HH. ''Robert E. Sherwood: The Playwright in Peace and War''. Univ. of Mass. Press (2007), pp. 88-91. {{ISBN|978-1-55849-619-4}}</ref> Sherwood is credited with originating the phrase that eventually evolved to "arsenal of democracy", a frequent catchphrase in Roosevelt's wartime speeches. Sherwood was quoted on May 12, 1940 by ''The New York Times''" "This country is already, in effect, an arsenal for the democratic Allies."<ref name=NYT>Gould, Jack (May 12, 1940). The Broadway Stage Has Its First War Play. ''The New York Times''. Quoting Robert Emmet Sherwood, "this country is already, in effect, an arsenal for the democratic Allies."</ref>

The 1946 film, which explores changes in the lives of three soldiers after they return home from war, earned Sherwood an [[Academy Award]] for Best Screenplay.<ref>Alonso (2007), p.143.</ref>

==Death and legacy==
Sherwood died of a heart attack in New York City in 1955. A production of ''Small War on Murray Hill'', his final work, debuted on Broadway at the [[Ethel Barrymore Theatre]] on January 3, 1957.<ref>[http://www.playbill.com/production/small-war-on-murray-hill-ethel-barrymore-theatre-vault-0000004382 ''Small War on Murray Hill''] by Robert E.
