'''Neşāṭī''' (نشاطى) <span dir="ltr">(?–1674)</span> was the [[pen name]] ([[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]: ﻡﺨﻠﺺ ''maḫla<u>s</u>'') of an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] poet. He was a [[Sufism|Sufi]], or [[Islam]]ic [[Mysticism|mystic]], of the [[Mevlevi Order]], and his poetry is often considered exemplary of the "Indian style" (سبك هندی ''sebk-i hindî'') of [[Ottoman poetry]], a movement which flourished beginning in the 17th century.

==Life==
{{History of Turkish literature}}
Though one source<ref>{{harvp|Dede|n.d.}}</ref> claims that Neşâtî's real name was Süleymân (سليمان), the majority of sources give his name as Ahmed (أحمد). He was born in [[Edirne]], in the region of [[Thrace]]. It is not known exactly when he was born, though it is speculated<ref>{{harvp|Andrews|Black|Kalpaklı|2006|p=252}}</ref> that it was around the year 1600, on the evidence of a poem commemorating the winter of 1621–22, in which year the [[Bosphorus]] strait in [[Istanbul]] was known to be covered with ice:

:ن نقش كوستره آیا مشاعبيز سرما
:كه همچو آيينه يغ بسته اولدى صفحه آب

:''Ne naḳş göstere āyā müşa`biz-i sermā''
:''Ki hemçü āyīne yaḫ-beste oldu <u>s</u>afḥa-yi āb''<ref>{{harvp|Andrews|Black|Kalpaklı|2006|p=297}}</ref>

:Oh what designs might the magician of cold
::display?
:Like a mirror, the page of the water
::is bound in ice<ref>{{harvp|Andrews|Black|Kalpaklı|2006|p=133}}</ref>

Neşâtî first become affiliated with the Mevlevi order as a [[Apprenticeship|disciple]] of the ''[[Sheikh#The Shaykh of Sufism|shaykh]]'' Ağazâde Mehmed Dede, first in [[Gallipoli|Gelibolu]] in Thrace and then in [[Beşiktaş]] in Istanbul.<ref>{{harvp|Andrews|Black|Kalpaklı|2006|p=252}}</ref> After Ağazâde Mehmed Dede's death, Neşâtî went to [[Konya]] in central [[Anatolia]], where he served for a time at the tomb of [[Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi]]—the founder of the Mevlevi order—before finally returning, around the year 1670, to Edirne as the ''shaykh'' of the Murâdiyye [[Khanqah|Mevlevîhâne]] there. He died in 1674, and was buried in the courtyard of the Murâdiyye [[Mosque]].<ref>{{harvp|Şentürk|1999|p=555}}</ref>

==Work==
Neşâtî was not as prolific as many other Ottoman poets, but is nonetheless considered to be among the masters of the ''[[Ghazal|gazel]]'' form of poetry.<ref>{{harvp|Cengiz|1983|p=535}}</ref> He was strongly influenced by, and a great admirer of, the [[Persian literature|Persian]] poet `Urfī of [[Shiraz, Iran|Shîraz]] (d. 1591), about whom he wrote a treatise, the ''Şerḥ-i Müşkilāt-i `Urfī'' (شرح مشكلات عورفى "Explanation of the Difficulties of `Urfî"). It was primarily through the influence of `Urfî, among other Persian poets, that Neşâtî's poetry took on certain aspects of the so-called "Indian style", which was characterized by extravagant [[conceit]]s; a complex, [[Persian language|Persian]]-derived [[syntax]]; and a high level of [[Ambiguity|lexical]] and [[syntactic ambiguity]].<ref>{{harvp|Andrews|Black|Kalpaklı|2006|p=147}}</ref> An example is the following ''beyit'', or [[couplet]], from one of Neşâtî's most famous ''gazel''s:

:كه خامه كبی شکوه طراز غم عاشقز
:كه ناله كبی خامه شکواده نهانز

:''Geh ḫāme gibi şekve-ṭırāz-ı ġam-ı `āşkız''
:''Geh nāle gibi ḫāme-yi şekvāda nihānız''<ref>{{harvp|Cengiz|1983|p=544}}</ref>

:Sometimes we are like the reed pen that illuminates
::the plaints of love
:Sometimes like the lament hidden in the pen
::as it writes<ref>{{harvp|Andrews|Black|Kalpaklı|2006|p=131}}</ref>

The image used in the second line makes use of a [[Pun|double meaning]]—known in Ottoman Turkish as ''tevriyye'' (توريه)—of the word ''nāle'' (ناله): it can mean not only "lament" or "moan", but can also refer to a "[[reed pen]]", and specifically to the sound made by such a pen as it moves across the page in the act of writing.

Despite his [[word play]], however, Neşâtî was also a poet of high—if sometimes restrained—emotion, as present-day Turkish poet [[İlhan Berk]] points out in a short essay:

<blockquote>Above all, Neşâtî was a master of expression, a man of great precision and sensitivity. Not a shouter, hidden, quiet, sparkling, genuine. In his poems, one is always struck with a great and profound sensation. More importantly, despite his being a Mevlevî poet ... he does not attempt to appear learned or to pretend to wisdom, but prefers in his poems to behave like a person, pure and simple. And like all great poets, he is humble.{{efn|''Her şeyden önce, büyük bir söyleyiş ustası, büyük bir duyarlık adamıdır Neşâtî. Bağırmayan, gizli, sessiz, parıltılı, özgün. Hep büyük, derin bir duyarlık vurur şiirlerinden. Daha önemlisi, Mevlevî bir şair olmasına karşın ... bilge görünmeye, bilgelik taslamaya yanaşmaz, şiirlerinde sade bir insan gibi davranmayı yeğler. Bütün büyük şairler gibi de alçakgönüllüdür.''<ref>{{harvp|Berk|1999|p=245}}</ref>}}</blockquote>

The honest and undisguised expression of emotion that Berk's appreciation hints at can be seen, for example, in the opening couplets to one of Neşâtî's most often [[Anthology|anthologized]] ''gazel''s:

:كتدك اما كه قودك حسرت ايله جانى بله
:استه مم سنسز اولن صحبت يارانى بله

:باغه سنسز واره مم چشممه آتش کورينور
:كل خندانى دكل سرو خرامانى بله

:''Gitdiñ ammā ki ḳoduñ ḥasret ile cānı bile''
:''İstemem sensiz olān ṣoḥbet-i yārānı bile''

:''Baġa sensiz vāramam çeşmime āteş görünür''
:''Gül-i ḫandānı degil serv-i ḫırāmānı bile''<ref>{{harvp|Cengiz|1983|p=546}}</ref>

:You're gone—I'm alone in the company
::of longing
:I no longer want sweet talk with friends
::if you're not there

:I dare not go to the garden without you
:The laughing rose seems red as fire,
::the swaying cypress a pointed flame<ref>{{harvp|Andrews|Black|Kalpaklı|2006|p=132}}</ref>
