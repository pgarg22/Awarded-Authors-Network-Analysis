The series takes place in the world of the shattered Therin Throne Empire and its successor states. It follows the life of the young professional thief and con artist Locke Lamora, over a period of some fifteen to twenty years. Lynch has stated that there will be a sequel series set twenty years after with new protagonists, which will also be seven books long.

The world described has a society and technology roughly similar to that of the historical 16th or 17th century, but with several crucial differences: the world is littered with "Elderglass", an unbreakable material left behind by mysterious beings known as "Eldren"; firearms have not been discovered, the crossbow being the most advanced offensive weapon known; magic exists, virtually monopolized by the secretive and malevolent Bondsmagi; the practice of alchemy offers some devices far beyond 17th century levels, such as alchemical lights which are the equivalent of electric ones. Though the society depicted is far from egalitarian, and there is an enormous gap between rich and poor, it does have very considerable [[gender equality]]. Similar to present-day Western society—and very different from historical 17th century societies—women in this world can and do have jobs and careers, on both the bottom and the top of society. Within a few chapters of ''[[Red Seas Under Red Skies]]'' the (male) protagonists encounter female dock workers, female carpenters, female assassins, female captains of both naval and pirate ships, and women in various other positions.

Lynch has described each novel of the series as "[covering] what you might call a different general situation" in which "the same characters getting into trouble but the backdrop changes."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Arts-Entertainment/Scott-Lynch-Audiobook/B01N47VK2Y|title=Scott Lynch: Audible Sessions: FREE Exclusive Interview|date=30 November 2016|website=Audible}}</ref>

===''Queen of the Iron Sands''===
In August 2009 Lynch began to publish the online novel ''Queen of the Iron Sands'',<ref>{{cite web|last=Lynch|first=Scott|title=Queen of the Iron Sands|url=http://www.scottlynch.us/ironsands.html|work=Scott Lynch, Keyboard Jockey|access-date=18 September 2012}}</ref> a [[planetary romance]], in the style of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]' [[Barsoom]] novels. The story concerns female aviator and ex-[[Women Airforce Service Pilots|WASP]] who is transported to a fantastic [[Mars]]. Chapters were scheduled to be released weekly. The serialization ran until September 2009 and picked up in June 2010 and halted again in September 2012.
