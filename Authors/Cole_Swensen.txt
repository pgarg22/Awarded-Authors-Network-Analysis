'''Cole Swensen''' (born [[1955 in poetry|1955]], in [[Kentfield, California]]) is an [[American poet]], translator, editor, copywriter, and professor. Swensen was awarded a 2006 [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] and is the author of more than ten poetry collections and as many translations of works from the French.  She received her B.A. and M.A. from [[San Francisco State University]] and a Ph.D. in [[Comparative Literature]] from the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], and served as the Director of the Creative Writing Program at the [[University of Denver]]. She taught at the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]] at the [[University of Iowa]] until 2012 when she joined the faculty of [[Brown University]]'s Literary Arts Program.

Her work is considered Postmodern and post-[[Language poetry|Language]] school, though she maintains close ties with many of the original authors from that group (such as [[Lyn Hejinian]], [[Carla Harryman]], [[Barrett Watten]], [[Charles Bernstein]],) as well as poets from all over the US and Europe. Her work is hybrid in nature, sometimes called ''lyric-Language poetry'' emerging from a strong background in the poetic and visual art traditions of both the US and France and adding to them her own vision.

In the US, Cole Swensen's ninth collection of poetry, ''Goest'' (Alice James Books, 2004) was a finalist for the [[National Book Award]].<ref>http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2004_cswensen.htm {{Bare URL inline|date=November 2021}}</ref> Earlier works have been awarded a [[National Poetry Series]] selection, Sun & Moon's ''New American Writing Award'', the Iowa Poetry Prize via [[University of Iowa Press]], the San Francisco State Poetry Center Book Award, and two [[Pushcart Prize|Pushcart]] Prizes.
Her translation of Jean Frémon's The ''Island of the Dead'' won the 2004 [[International PEN|PEN]] USA Literary Award for Translation. She has also received grants from the Association Beaumarchais and the French Bureau du Livre.

==Sidelights==
In France, Swensen has participated in readings and collaborative translation projects with such organizations as the Royaumont Foundation at the beautiful L'abbaye de Royaumont, [[Columbia University]]’s Reed Hall, the maison des écrivains et de la littérature <ref>http://www.maison-des-ecrivains.asso.fr/</ref> in Paris, Double Change <ref>http://www.doublechange.com/</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.doublechange.com/blog/readings/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005005021/http://www.doublechange.com/blog/readings/index.html |archivedate=2007-10-05 }}</ref> and Ivy Writers Paris.<ref>http://www.ivywritersparis.blogspot.com/</ref> Her life-long commitment to translation is a testament to her belief in the international exchange of words and language, and in the importance of radical and traditional poetries for contemporary society.

She is member of the [[Academy of American Poets]], and a contributing editor for the periodicals ''American Letters & Commentary'' and for ''Shiny,'' and for many years was the translation editor for the online contemporary poetry and poetics review ''How2''.<ref>http://www.asu.edu/pipercwcenter/how2journal/</ref>

She divides her time between Paris and Providence, RI, where she is on the permanent faculty of [[Brown University]]'s Literary Arts Program. She is also the founder and editor of La Presse, a small press dedicated to the translation and publication in English of contemporary French poetry (such as by [[Claude Royet-Journoud]] or Marie Borel).
