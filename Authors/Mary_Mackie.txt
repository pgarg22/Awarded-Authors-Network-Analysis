Later, she joined the Local WRAF and worked in the Accounts section at RAF Waddington, where she met her future husband. 

Early in her marriage to RAF Sgt Christopher Mackie, Mary and her family spent some time stationed at RAF Gatow, in Berlin (a city then still divided by the Wall), and later in [[West Germany]], where she wrote her first full-length novel. She was first published in 1971. Chris retired from the RAF as a warrant officer and they settled into civilian life near Lincoln.

Mary Mackie now lives at [[Heacham]] near [[Hunstanton]] on the [[Norfolk]] coast of England. Her husband had been evacuated there during the Second World War, at the age of 10, and they returned to the village in 1990. The couple had two sons and there are now four grandchildren.

==Work==
Mary Mackie's books ''Cobwebs and [[Cream tea|Cream Teas]]'' (1990), ''[[Dry Rot]] and Daffodils'' (1994) and ''Frogspawn and Floor Polish'' (2003) are light-hearted accounts of life in the North Norfolk [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] property [[Felbrigg Hall]], where her husband was houseman (administrator) for seven years up to 1990.<ref>Hachette site.</ref>

Another non-fiction book of hers that attracted notice was ''The Prince's Thorn'' (2008), about Louisa Mary Cresswell (1830–1916), whose autobiographical ''Eighteen Years on [[Sandringham House|Sandringham]] Estate'' by "The Lady Farmer" (1887)<ref>British Library Catalogue entry: [http://explore.bl.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/display.do?tabs=moreTab&ct=display&fn=search&doc=BLL01003244719&indx=1&recIds=BLL01003244719&recIdxs=0&elementId=0&renderMode=poppedOut&displayMode=full&frbrVersion=&dscnt=1&scp.scps=scope%3A%28BLCONTENT%29&frbg=&tab=local_tab&dstmp=1392722243099&srt=rank&mode=Basic&vl(488279563UI0)=any&dum=true&tb=t&vl(freeText0)=Cresswell%20Sandringham%20Estate&vid=BLVU1 Retrieved 18 February 2014.] Cresswell had already written two non-controversial pamphlets: ''Norfolk and the Squires, Clergy, Farmers and Labourers, etc.'' (1875) and ''How the Farming in Great Britain Can Be Made to Pay'' (2nd e. 1881). An earlier account of the scandal was by David Skene Duff: ''Whisper Louise. Edward VII and Mrs Cresswell'' (1974).</ref> was bitterly critical of [[Edward VII|Edward, Prince of Wales]] and his circle.<ref>Publisher's site. [https://pegasuspublishers.com/authors/mary-mackie Retrieved 25 June 2018.]</ref> However, Mary Mackie's new researches, including two days spent working in the Royal Archive at Windsor, proved that there was a different side to this story.

Having written a commissioned history of [[Princess Mary's Royal Air Force Nursing Service]] entitled ''Sky Wards'' (2001 revised edition ''Wards in the Sky'', 2014), Mary Mackie wrote a short illustrated book for the Highlanders' Museum in [[Ardersier]], Scotland, entitled ''Hunstanton's Highland Heroes''.<ref>''Hunstanton's Highland Heroes: West Norfolk 1915'' ([[King's Lynn]]: Morningside Publishers, 2018. {{ISBN|0-95759-782-7}}.</ref> It tells how soldiers of the [[Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders]] were headquartered in Hunstanton while training for active service in 1915.<ref>The Highlanders' Museum [http://www.thehighlandersmuseum.com/store/hunstantons-highland-heroes/ Retrieved 7 September 2018]</ref><ref>Bookseller's details [https://picclick.co.uk/LOVAT-SCOUTS-HUNSTANTONS-HIGHLAND-HEROES-by-Mary-323421402370.html Retrieved 7 September 2018.]</ref>

Mackie's historical novel ''The People of the Horse'' (1987), about Queen [[Boudica|Boudicca]] of the [[Iceni]], was translated into Czech and Hungarian. Three more, set in Victorian Norfolk, were ''Sandringham Rose'' (1992), ''A Child of Secrets'' (1993) and ''The Clouded Land'' (1994).<ref name="Author's books">.[http://www.stillscribbling.co.uk/books/books.html Retrieved 18 August 2014.]</ref>
