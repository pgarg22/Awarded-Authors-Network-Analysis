'''Brendan Francis Aidan Behan'''<ref>Brendan Behan: A Life, Michael O'Sullivan, pg 23</ref> (christened '''Francis Behan''')<ref>Brendan Behan: A Life, Michael O'Sullivan, pg xi</ref> ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|iː|ə|n}} {{respell|BEE|ən}}; {{lang-ga|Breandán Ó Beacháin}}; 9 February 1923 – 20 March 1964) was an Irish poet, short story writer, novelist and [[playwright]] who wrote in both English and Irish. He was named by Irish Central as one of the greatest Irish writers of all time.<ref>{{Cite web|title = From James Joyce to Oscar Wilde, top ten Irish novelists in history|url = http://www.irishcentral.com/roots/our-top-ten-irish-novelists-of-all-time-126080063-237787691.html|website = IrishCentral.com|access-date = 2015-10-27|archive-date = 17 August 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160817004358/http://www.irishcentral.com/roots/our-top-ten-irish-novelists-of-all-time-126080063-237787691.html|url-status = live}}</ref>

An [[Irish republican]] and a [[Volunteer (Irish republican)|volunteer]] in the [[Irish Republican Army (1922–1969)|Irish Republican Army]], Behan was born in [[Dublin]] into a staunchly republican family becoming a member of the IRA's youth organisation [[Fianna Éireann]] at the age of fourteen. There was also a strong emphasis on [[Irish history]] and [[Culture of Ireland|culture]] in the home, which meant he was steeped in literature and patriotic ballads from an early age. Behan eventually joined the IRA at sixteen, which led to his serving time in a [[borstal]] youth prison in the United Kingdom and he was also imprisoned in [[Irish Free State|Ireland]]. During this time, he took it upon himself to study and he became a fluent speaker of the [[Irish language]]. Subsequently released from prison as part of a general amnesty given by the [[Fianna Fáil]] government in 1946, Behan moved between homes in Dublin, [[County Kerry|Kerry]] and [[Connemara]], and also resided in [[Paris]] for a time.

In 1954, Behan's first play ''[[The Quare Fellow]]'', was produced in [[Dublin]]. It was well received; however, it was the 1956 production at [[Joan Littlewood]]'s [[Theatre Workshop]] in Stratford, London, that gained Behan a wider reputation. This was helped by a famous drunken interview on [[BBC]] television with [[Malcolm Muggeridge]]. In 1958, Behan's play in the Irish language ''[[The Hostage (play)|An Giall]]'' had its debut at Dublin's [[Damer Hall|Damer Theatre]]. Later, ''The Hostage'', Behan's English-language adaptation of ''An Giall'', met with great success internationally. Behan's [[autobiographical novel]], ''[[Borstal Boy]]'', was published the same year and became a worldwide best-seller.

By the early 1960s, Behan reached the peak of his fame. He spent increasing amounts of time in [[New York City]], famously declaring, "To [[United States of America|America]], my new found land: The man that hates you hates the human race."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/1103068129|title=NYC – Chelsea – Hotel Chelsea – James Schuyler, Brendan Behan|website=Flickr|language=en-us|access-date=2017-05-25|archive-date=11 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170511233035/https://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/1103068129/|url-status=live}}</ref> By this point, Behan began spending time with people including [[Harpo Marx]] and [[Arthur Miller]] and was followed by a young [[Bob Dylan]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/brendan-s-tragic-voyage-behan-in-the-usa-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-most-famous-irishman-in-new-york-1.1796949|title=Brendan's tragic voyage: Behan in the USA: The Rise and Fall of the Most Famous Irishman in New York|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2017-05-25|language=en-US|archive-date=1 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101165747/http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/brendan-s-tragic-voyage-behan-in-the-usa-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-most-famous-irishman-in-new-york-1.1796949|url-status=live}}</ref> However, this newfound fame did nothing to aid his health or his work, with his alcoholism and diabetes medical conditions continuing to deteriorate: ''Brendan Behan's New York'' and ''Confessions of an Irish Rebel'' received little praise. He briefly attempted to combat this by a dry stretch while staying at Chelsea Hotel in New York, and in 1961 was admitted to Sunnyside Private Hospital,<ref>{{Cite news|date=March 28, 1961|title=Behan enters alcoholics clinic for treatment|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref> an institution for the treatment of alcoholism in [[Toronto]], but he once again turned back to alcohol and relapsed back into active alcoholism.

They lived in a house on Russell Street near [[Mountjoy Square]] owned by his grandmother, Christine English, who owned a number of properties in the area. Brendan's father [[Stephen Behan]], a house painter who had been active in the [[Irish War of Independence]], read classic literature to the children at bedtime from sources including the works of [[Émile Zola|Zola]], [[John Galsworthy|Galsworthy]] and [[Guy de Maupassant|Maupassant]]; his mother, [[Kathleen Behan|Kathleen]], took them on literary tours of the city. She remained politically active all her life and was a personal friend of the Irish republican [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]]. Brendan Behan wrote a lament to Collins, ''The Laughing Boy'', at the age of thirteen. The title was from the affectionate nickname Mrs Behan gave to Collins. Kathleen published her autobiography, ''Mother of All The Behans'', a collaboration with her son Brian, in 1984.

A biographer, [[Ulick O'Connor]], recounts that one day, at age eight, Brendan was returning home with his granny and a crony from a drinking session. A passer-by remarked, "Oh, my! Isn't it terrible ma'am to see such a beautiful child deformed?" "How dare you," said his granny. "He's not deformed, he's just drunk!"

Behan left school at 13 to follow in his father's footsteps as a house painter.<ref name=ODNB/>

==IRA activities==
In 1937, the Behan family moved to a newly-built local council housing scheme in Kildare Road, [[Kimmage]], then seen by Dubliners as the countryside – Stephen muttered that the working classes were being sent "To Hell or to Kimmage" a parody of [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s demand that the Irish be sent "To Hell or to Connacht". Behan became a member of [[Fianna Éireann]], the youth organisation of the [[Irish Republican Army (1922-1969)|Anti-Treaty IRA]]. He published his first poems and prose in the organisation's magazine, ''Fianna: the Voice of Young Ireland''. In 1931 he also became the youngest contributor to be published in ''The Irish Press'' with his poem ''Reply of Young Boy to Pro-English verses''.

At 16, Behan joined the IRA and embarked on an unauthorised solo mission to England to set off a bomb at the [[Liverpool]] docks. He was arrested by British law enforcement and found in possession of [[explosive material|explosives]]. As Behan was only 16 at the time of his arrest, British prosecutors tried to convince him to testify against his IRA superiors and offered in return to relocate him under a new name to Canada or another faraway colony of the [[British Empire]].

Refusing to be turned, Behan was sentenced to three years in a [[borstal]] ([[HM Prison Hollesley Bay|Hollesley Bay]],<ref>

He wrote about the experience in the memoir ''[[Borstal Boy]]''.

In 1942, during the [[World War II|wartime]] [[The Emergency (Ireland)|state of emergency]] declared by Irish [[Taoiseach]] [[Eamonn De Valera]], Behan was arrested by the [[Garda Síochána]] and put on trial for [[conspiracy to murder]] and the [[attempted murder]] of two Garda Detectives, which the IRA had planned for during a Dublin commemoration ceremony for [[Theobald Wolfe Tone]]. Behan was found guilty and sentenced to 14 years of imprisonment. 

He was first incarcerated in [[Mountjoy Prison]] in Dublin and then interned both with other IRA men and with [[Allies (World War II)|Allied]] and [[Luftwaffe|German airmen]] at the [[Curragh Camp]] in [[County Kildare]]. He later related his experiences there in his memoir ''Confessions of an Irish Rebel''. Released under a general [[amnesty]] for IRA prisoners and internees in 1946, Behan's active IRA career was largely over by the age of 23. Aside from a short prison sentence in 1947 for trying to break an imprisoned IRA man out of prison in [[Manchester]], Behan effectively left the organisation but remained friends with [[Cathal Goulding]].<ref>''A tribute to The Lost People of [[Arlington House UK|Arlington House]]'', [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]], London 2004</ref>

==Writer==
Behan's prison experiences were central to his future writing career. In Mountjoy he wrote his first play, ''The Landlady'' and also began to write short stories and other prose. It was a literary magazine called ''[[Envoy, A Review of Literature and Art|Envoy]]'' (A Review of Literature and Art), founded by [[John Ryan (Dublin artist)|John Ryan]], that first published Behan's short stories and his first poem. Some of his early work was also published in ''[[The Bell (magazine)|The Bell]],'' the leading Irish literary magazine of the time. He learned Irish in prison and, after his release in 1946, he spent some time in the [[Gaeltacht]] areas of [[County Galway|Galway]] and [[County Kerry|Kerry]], where he started writing poetry in Irish.

During this period he was employed by the [[Commissioners of Irish Lights]],<ref>{{Cite web|last=McConville|first=Marie Louise|date=2017-10-04|title=Funeral of 'kind' lighthouse keeper who struck up friendship with Brendan Behan|url=http://www.irishnews.com/news/2017/10/04/news/mourners-gather-for-funeral-of-kind-retired-lighthouse-keeper-in-killough-co-down-1153003/|access-date=2021-03-29|website=The Irish News|language=en|archive-date=4 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171004041236/http://www.irishnews.com/news/2017/10/04/news/mourners-gather-for-funeral-of-kind-retired-lighthouse-keeper-in-killough-co-down-1153003/|url-status=live}}</ref> where one lighthouse keeper, recommending his dismissal,  described him as “the worst specimen” he had met in 30 years of service, adding that he showed "careless indifference" and "no respect for property".<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-06-05|title=St John's Point Lighthouse (and Brendan Behan)|url=http://www.coastal.ie/land/ireland-buildings/st-johns-point-lighthouse-and-brendan-behan/|access-date=2021-03-29|website=COASTAL|language=en-US|archive-date=14 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200814024856/http://www.coastal.ie/land/ireland-buildings/st-johns-point-lighthouse-and-brendan-behan/|url-status=live}}</ref> 

He left Ireland and all its perceived social pressures to live in Paris in the early 1950s. There, he felt he could lose himself and release the artist within. Although he still drank heavily, he managed to earn a living, supposedly by writing pornography.{{Citation needed|date=March 2021}} He returned to Dublin and began to write seriously, and to be published in serious papers such as ''[[The Irish Times]]'', for which he wrote In 1953, drawing on his extensive knowledge of criminal activity in Dublin and Paris, he wrote a serial, that was later published as ''The Scarperer''. 

Throughout the rest of his writing career, he would rise at seven in the morning and work until noon, when the pubs opened. He began to write for radio, and his play ''The Leaving Party'' was broadcast. Literary Ireland in the 1950s was a place where people drank. Behan cultivated a reputation as carouser-in-chief and swayed shoulder-to-shoulder with other literati of the day who used the pub McDaid's as their base: [[Brian O'Nolan|Flann O'Brien]], [[Patrick Kavanagh]], [[Patrick Swift]], [[Anthony Cronin]], [[John Jordan (poet)|John Jordan]], [[J. P. Donleavy]] and artist [[Desmond MacNamara]] whose bust of Behan is on display at the National Writers Museum. Behan fell out with the spiky Kavanagh, who reportedly would visibly shudder at the mention of Behan's name and who referred to him as "evil incarnate".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/drama/3670838/Brendan-at-the-Chelsea-less-large-than-life.html |title=Brendan at the Chelsea: less large than life |first=Dominic |last=Cavendish |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=31 January 2008 |quote=It hints at Behan's bisexuality without getting explicit and never paints him, as Patrick Kavanaugh (sic) once described him, as "evil incarnate". |access-date=3 April 2018 |archive-date=5 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181105223321/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/drama/3670838/Brendan-at-the-Chelsea-less-large-than-life.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Behan's fortunes changed in 1954, with the appearance of his play ''[[The Quare Fellow]]''. Originally called ''The Twisting of Another Rope'' and influenced by his time spent in jail, it chronicles the vicissitudes of prison life leading up to the execution of "The quare fellow", a character who is never seen. The prison dialogue is vivid and laced with satire but reveals to the reader the human detritus that surrounds capital punishment. Produced in the [[Pike Theatre]], in Dublin, the play ran for six months. In May 1956, ''The Quare Fellow'' opened in the [[Theatre Royal Stratford East]], in a production by [[Joan Littlewood]]'s [[Theatre Workshop]]. Subsequently, it transferred to the West End. Behan generated immense publicity for ''The Quare Fellow'' as a result of a drunken appearance on the [[Malcolm Muggeridge]] TV show. The English, relatively unaccustomed to public drunkenness in authors, took him to their hearts. A fellow guest on the show, Irish-American actor [[Jackie Gleason]], reportedly said about the incident: "It wasn't an act of God, but an act of Guinness!" Behan and Gleason went on to forge a friendship. Behan loved the story of how, walking along the street in London shortly after this episode, a [[Cockney]] approached him and exclaimed that he understood every word he had said—drunk or not—but had not a clue what "that bugger Muggeridge was on about!" While addled, Brendan would clamber on stage and recite the play's signature song, ''The Auld Triangle''. The transfer of the play to Broadway provided Behan with international recognition. Rumours still abound that Littlewood contributed much of the text of ''The Quare Fellow'' and led to the saying, "[[Dylan Thomas]] wrote ''[[Under Milk Wood]]'', Brendan Behan wrote under Littlewood". Littlewood remained a supporter, visiting him in Dublin in 1960.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/august-4th-1960-1.589413|title=August 4th, 1960|newspaper=The Irish Times|access-date=2 July 2020|archive-date=25 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325163351/http://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/august-4th-1960-1.589413|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1958, his Irish-language play ''An Giall'' (''[[The Hostage (play)|The Hostage]]'') opened in the Damer Theatre, Dublin. Reminiscent of Frank O'Connor's ''[[Guests of the Nation]]'', it portrays the detention in a teeming Dublin house in the late 1950s of a British [[conscript]] soldier, seized by the IRA as a [[hostage]] pending the scheduled execution in Northern Ireland of an imprisoned IRA volunteer. The hostage falls in love with an Irish [[convent]] girl, Teresa, working as a maid in the house. Their innocent world of love is incongruous among their surroundings since the house also serves as a [[brothel]]. In the end, the hostage dies accidentally during a bungled police raid, revealing the human cost of war, a universal suffering. The subsequent English-language version ''The Hostage'' (1958), reflecting Behan's own translation from the Irish but also much influenced by Joan Littlewood during a troubled collaboration with Behan, is a bawdy, slapstick play that adds a number of flamboyantly gay characters and bears only a limited resemblance to the original version.

His autobiographical novel ''[[Borstal Boy]]'' followed in 1958. In the vivid [[memoir]] of his time in St Andrews House, Hollesley Bay Colony Borstal, near Woodbridge, Suffolk, England. (The site of St Andrews House is now a Category D men's prison and Young Offenders Institution). An original voice in Irish literature boomed out from its pages. The language is both acerbic and delicate, the portrayal of inmates and "screws" cerebral. For a Republican, though, it is not a vitriolic attack on Britain; it delineates Behan's move away from violence. In one account, an inmate strives to entice Behan into chanting political slogans with him. Behan curses and damns him in his mind, hoping that he would cease his rantings-hardly the sign of a troublesome prisoner. By the end, the idealistic boy rebel emerges as a realistic young man, who recognises the truth: violence, especially political violence, is futile. The 1950s literary critic [[Kenneth Tynan]] said: "If the English hoard words like misers... Behan sends them out on a spree, ribald, flushed, and spoiling for a fight." He was now established as one of the leading Irish writers of his generation.

Behan revered the memory of Father [[Willie Doyle|William Doyle]], a Dublin [[Roman Catholic priest|priest]] of the [[Society of Jesus]], who served as [[military chaplain]] to the [[Royal Dublin Fusiliers]] as they fought in the trenches of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. Father Doyle was [[killed in action]] while running to the aid of wounded soldiers from his regiment during the [[Battle of Passchendaele]] in 1917. Behan expressed his affection for Father Doyle's memory in the memoir ''[[Borstal Boy]]''. [[Alfred O'Rahilly]]'s 1920 biography of the fallen chaplain was one of Behan's favorite books.<ref>Patrick Kenny (2017), ''To Raise the Fallen: A Selection of the War Letters, Prayers, and Spiritual Writings of Fr. Willie Doyle, S.J.'', [[Ignatius Press]], page 32.</ref>

==Personal life==
Behan married horticultural illustrator for ''[[The Irish Times]]'' [[Beatrice Behan|Beatrice ffrench Salkeld]], daughter of the painter [[Cecil Ffrench Salkeld|Cecil ffrench Salkeld]], in February 1955. (Naturally, Dublin wits nicknamed the family the ffrench Behans.) A daughter, Blanaid, was born in 1963, shortly before Behan's death.<ref name=ODNB/> 

==Decline and death==
[[Image:Grave of Brendan Behan.jpg|160px|thumb|Grave of Brendan Behan by Clíodhna Cussen, Glasnevin, Dublin. A bronze likeness of Brendan's face was stolen from the vacant opening.]]
Behan found fame difficult. He had long been a heavy drinker (describing himself, on one occasion, as "a drinker with a writing problem" and claiming "I only drink on two occasions—when I'm thirsty and when I'm not") and developed [[diabetes]] in the early 1950s but this was not diagnosed until 1956.<ref name=ODNB/> As his fame grew, so too did his alcohol addiction. This combination resulted in a series of famously drunken public appearances, on both stage and television. Behan's favourite drink was champagne and sherry.

The public wanted the witty, iconoclastic, genial "broth of a boy", and he gave that to them in abundance, once exclaiming: "There's no bad publicity except an obituary." His health suffered, with [[diabetic coma]]s and [[seizure]]s occurring regularly. The public who once extended their arms now closed ranks against him; publicans flung him from their premises. His books, ''Brendan Behan's Island'', ''Brendan Behan's New York'' and ''Confessions of an Irish Rebel'', published in 1962 and 1964, were dictated into a tape recorder because he was no longer able to write or type for long enough to be able to finish them.<ref>Jeffs, Rae, ''Brendan Behan, Man and Showman'' (1966)</ref>

Behan died on 20 March 1964 after collapsing at the Harbour Lights bar (now the Harbour Bar) in Echlin Street, Dublin. He was transferred to the [[Meath Hospital]] in central Dublin, where he died, aged 41. At his funeral he was given a full IRA guard of honour, which escorted his coffin.

==In popular culture==

Behan is frequently mentioned in works of popular culture. His work has been a significant influence in the writings of [[Shane MacGowan]], and he is the subject of ''Streams of Whiskey'', a song by [[The Pogues]]. The Pogues' ''[[Thousands Are Sailing]]'' features the lyric ''and in Brendan Behan's footsteps / I danced up and down the street''. Behan is also referenced in [[Damien Dempsey]]'s 'Jar Song'. Behan's version of the third verse of ''[[The Internationale]]'', from ''[[Borstal Boy]]'' was reproduced on the [[Long Playing|LP]] sleeve of [[Dexys Midnight Runners]]'s debut album, ''[[Searching for the Young Soul Rebels]]''.

Australian singer songwriter [[Paul Kelly (Australian musician)|Paul Kelly]] wrote ''Laughing Boy'' as tribute to Behan, and it was covered by [[Weddings, Parties, Anything]] on their ''[[Roaring Days]]'' album. 
The [[Mighty Mighty Bosstones]] 2000 album ''[[Pay Attention]]'' features the song ''All Things Considered'', which contains the lyrics ''Most of what he tells us no one's verified / He swears he was there the day that Brendan Behan died''.

Chicago-based band [[The Tossers]] wrote the song ''Breandan Ó Beacháin'', released on their 2008 album ''On A Fine Spring Evening''. Shortly after Behan's death a student, Fred Geis, wrote the song ''Lament for Brendan Behan'' and passed it on to the [[Clancy Brothers]], who sang it on their album ''[[Recorded Live in Ireland]]'' the same year. This song, which calls "bold Brendan" Ireland's "sweet angry singer", was later covered by the Australian trio The [[Doug Anthony All Stars]], better known as a comedy band, on their album ''Blue''. ''Brendan'' is Seamus Robinson's song-tribute to Behan. Behan's prison song ''[[The Auld Triangle]]'' (which featured in his play ''The Quare Fellow'' —this term being prison slang for a prisoner condemned to be hanged), has become a standard and has been recorded on numerous occasions by folk musicians as well as popular bands such as [[The Pogues]], [[The Dubliners]], the [[Dropkick Murphys]] and The [[Doug Anthony All Stars]]. Behan is also referenced in the opening line of [[the Mountain Goats]] song ''Commandante'', where the narrator proclaims that he will "drink more whiskey than Brendan Behan".

Behan's two poems from his work ''The Hostage'', ''On the eighteenth day of November'' and ''The Laughing Boy'' were translated into Swedish and recorded by [[Ann Sofi Nilsson]] on the album ''När kommer dagen''. The same poems were translated in 1966 to Greek and recorded by [[Maria Farantouri]] on the album ''Ένας όμηρος'' (''The hostage'') by [[Mikis Theodorakis]].

A pub named after Behan is located in the historically Irish [[Jamaica Plain]] section of [[Boston]], Massachusetts. A bronze sculpture of the writer stands outside the Palace Bar on Dublin's Fleet Street.<ref>Nihill, Cian. [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/1006/1224305331078.html "Palace of inspiration: Sculptures of writers unveiled"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006165507/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/1006/1224305331078.html |date=6 October 2011 }}, ''The Irish Times'', 6 October 2011.</ref>

According to J.P. Donleavy's ''History of The Ginger Man'', Behan was instrumental in bringing Donleavy in contact with M. Girodios of Olympia Press (Paris) to help Donleavy's first novel, ''[[The Ginger Man]]'', be published despite its having been ostracised by the world literature community for its "filth" and "obscenity".

In the season 4 ''[[Mad Men]]'' episode ''Blowing Smoke', which premiered on 10 October 2010, Midge Daniels introduces Don to her playwright husband, Perry, and says, "When we met, I said he looked like Brendan Behan."

In May 2011, ''Brendan at the Chelsea'', written by Behan's niece [[Janet Behan]], was the first play performed in the Naughton Studio at the new [[Lyric Theatre (Belfast)|Lyric Theatre]] in Belfast. The production tells the story of Behan's residence at New York's [[Hotel Chelsea]] in 1963. It was a critical success and is being revived for a tour to Theatre Row in New York in September 2013 before returning to the Lyric in October 2013.

[[Morrissey]]'s 2014 song ''Mountjoy'' references the writer: ''Brendan Behan's laughter rings / For what he had or hadn’t done / For he knew then as I know now / That for each and every one of us / We all lose / Rich or poor, / We all lose / Rich or poor, they all lose''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mountjoy Lyrics |url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/mountjoy-lyrics-morrissey.html |website=Metrolyrics.com |access-date=30 July 2014 |archive-date=10 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810160701/http://www.metrolyrics.com/mountjoy-lyrics-morrissey.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Kirkpatrick |first1=Marion |title=Morrissey's 'World Peace is None of Your Business': What the Critics are Saying |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/morrissey-world-peace-your-business-718749 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=30 July 2014 |archive-date=8 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808044243/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/morrissey-world-peace-your-business-718749 |url-status=live }}</ref>
