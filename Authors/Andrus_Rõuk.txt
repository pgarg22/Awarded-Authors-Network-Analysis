'''Andrus Rõuk''' (born 28 September 1957, in [[Tallinn]]) is an [[Estonia]]n artist and poet.

In 1981, in the 9th number of the literary journal ''[[Looming (journal)|Looming]]'' his poem "Silmades taevas ja meri" ("In the eyes sky and sea") appeared. It is an [[acrostic]]: the first letters of the verses read  "SINIMUSTVALGE" ("blue-black-white"), the colours of the national [[flag of Estonia]] (at a time when Estonia was occupied and the use of national flag was forbidden; the [[flag of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic]] was mostly red with some blue and white). For this he was excluded from the Estonian State Institute of Arts (currently [[Estonian Academy of Arts]]).<ref>[[Teet Kallas]]. "Sinimustvalge sügis 1981".
