'''Alan Bradley''' (born 1938) is a Canadian mystery writer known for his ''Flavia de Luce'' series, which began with the acclaimed ''[[The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie]]''.

==Early life and engineering career==

Bradley was born in 1938 in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada.  He was brought up with two older sisters in the small town of [[Cobourg, Ontario]].  His mother raised the children alone after Bradley's father left the family when he was a toddler.<ref name="globeandmail">Morrow, Fiona, "At 70, a novelist is born", ''The Globe and Mail'', February 14, 2009, pg. R1. [[Factiva]] (subscription required). Retrieved 24 July 2012.</ref> Bradley learned to read at an early age, partly because he was a sickly child who spent a lot of time in bed.<ref name="abebooks">{{cite web|url=http://www.abebooks.com/books/authors-corner/alan-bradley.shtml|title=Alan Bradley Interview|publisher=AbeBooks|accessdate=2012-04-04}}</ref> However, Bradley confesses to having been a "very bad student",<ref name="globeandmail"/> particularly in high school,<ref name="abebooks"/> spending his free time reading in the local cemetery because he felt he didn't fit in.

After completing his education, Bradley worked in Cobourg as a radio and television engineer, designing and building electronic systems. He then worked briefly for Ryerson Polytechnical Institute in Toronto (now [[Ryerson University]]), before moving to [[Saskatoon]] to take a job at the [[University of Saskatchewan]] in 1969. There he helped develop a broadcasting studio, where he worked as Director of Television Engineering for 25 years. He took an early retirement from the university in 1994 to become a full-time writer.<ref name="globeandmail"/>

==Writing career==

Bradley wrote several short stories that were read on [[CBC Radio]] and published in literary magazines. Following his early retirement from the University of Saskatchewan in 1994, Bradley and his wife Shirley moved to [[Kelowna, British Columbia]], for her work, while Bradley focused on writing. He wrote multiple screenplays over the course of nine years. Then, during the [[2003 Okanagan Mountain Park Fire]], many homes neighboring Bradley's were destroyed, although his was spared from the fire. The experience inspired him to do something different, and he began focusing on memoirs instead of screenplays.<ref name="globeandmail"/> He wrote a non-fiction book called ''Ms Holmes of Baker Street'' and a memoir called ''The Shoebox Bible''.<ref name="abebooks"/>

Bradley's wife was listening to CBC Radio as [[Louise Penny]], a Canadian mystery author, discussed the Debut [[Crime Writers' Association|Dagger]] fiction competition, run by the U.K. [[Crime Writers' Association]] and sponsored by the [[Orion Publishing Group]] in Britain. The competition requires that entrants submit the first chapter and a synopsis of a murder mystery. Bradley's wife encouraged him to write something new about the "girl on the camp stool", a minor character who had emerged in the novel Bradley was working on. In early 2007, Bradley entered the Dagger contest by submitting fifteen pages about the "girl on the camp stool" character, now named Flavia de Luce. These pages, which took only a few days to write and several weeks of polishing, would become the basis of ''[[The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie]]''.<ref name="globeandmail"/> Bradley set the book in England despite having never visited it.<ref name="abebooks"/> In June 2007, two judges from the contest contacted Bradley's agent in Canada to express interest in publishing the proposed book; they also inadvertently informed him that Bradley was the winner of the competition.  A bidding war ensued, and on June 27, 2007, Bradley sold Orion the rights for three books in Britain. Within several days, [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] had purchased the Canadian rights and [[Bantam Books]] the U.S. rights. At age 69, Bradley left North America for the first time when he went to London to pick up the Dagger award on July 5, 2007.

Upon his return to Canada after the award ceremony, Bradley took a few weeks off, and then spent seven months turning the submitted fifteen pages into a full-length novel. ''The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie'' was published in the UK in January 2009 and in Canada in February 2009.<ref name="globeandmail"/> The book has since developed into a series of novels about young Flavia de Luce solving various crimes in a 1950s village. The second installment (''The Weed That Strings the Hangman's Bag'') was published in March 2010,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books-and-media/review-the-weed-that-strings-the-hangmans-bag-by-alan-bradley/article4313098/ |title= A delightfully deadly child sleuth|author= H.J.
