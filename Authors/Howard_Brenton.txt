'''Howard John Brenton''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature|FRSL]] (born 13 December 1942) is an English playwright and screenwriter. While little-known in the United States, he is celebrated in his home country and often ranked alongside contemporaries such as [[Edward Bond]], [[Caryl Churchill]], and [[David Hare (playwright)|David Hare]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Kauffmann|first=Stanley|date=2006-04-23|title=Howard Brenton: A British Firebrand, Lost in Translation|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/23/theater/howard-brenton-a-british-firebrand-lost-in-translation.html|access-date=2020-07-02|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

==Early years==
Brenton was born in [[Portsmouth]], [[Hampshire]], son of policeman (later Methodist minister) Donald Henry Brenton and his wife Rose Lilian (née Lewis). He was educated at [[Chichester High School For Boys]] and read English Literature at [[St Catharine's College, Cambridge]]. In 1964 he was awarded the [[Chancellor's Gold Medal]] for Poetry.<ref name=ADC>ADC Theatre Archives, Cambridge.</ref> While at Cambridge he wrote a play, ''Ladder of Fools'' which was performed at the [[ADC Theatre]] as a double bill with "Hello-Goodbye Sebastian" by [[John Grillo]] in April 1965, and at the [[Oxford Playhouse]] in June of that year. It was described by Eric Shorter of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' as "Actable, gripping, murky and moody: how often can you say that of the average new play tried out in London, let alone of an undergraduate's work..."<ref name=ADC /> Brenton's one-act play, ''It's My Criminal'', was performed at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] (1966).

==Career==
In 1968 he joined the [[Brighton Combination]] as a writer and actor, and in 1969 joined [[Portable Theatre Company|Portable Theatre]] (founded by [[David Hare (dramatist)|David Hare]] and [[Tony Bicat]]), for whom he wrote ''[[Christie in Love]]'', staged in the Royal Court's Theatre Upstairs (1969) and ''Fruit'' (1970). He is also the author of ''Winter, Daddykins'' (1966), ''Revenge'' for the Royal Court Theatre Upstairs; and the triple-bill ''Heads'', ''Gum & Goo'' and ''The Education of Skinny Spew'' (1969). These were followed by ''Wesley'' (1970); ''Scott of the Antarctic'' and ''A Sky-blue Life'' (1971); ''Hitler Dances'', ''How Beautiful With Badges'', and an adaptation of ''[[Measure for Measure]]'' (1972).

In 1973 Brenton and David Hare were jointly commissioned by [[Richard Eyre]] to write a "big" play for [[Nottingham Playhouse]]. "The result was ''Brassneck'', which offered an exhilaratingly panoramic satire on England from 1945 to the present, depicting the meteoric ups and downs of a self-seeking Midlands family...from singing the Red Flag in 1945 to acting as a conduit for the Oriental drug market in the decadent Seventies." – [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]] (2007).<ref name=Billington>Michael Billington, ''State of the Nation: British Theatre since 1945'', Faber (2007) {{ISBN|978-0-571-21034-3}}</ref>  ''Brassneck'' was followed a year later by Brenton's ''[[The Churchill Play]]'', again staged by Richard Eyre at the Nottingham Playhouse (1974), another 'state of the nation play' about the growing conflict between security and liberty, opening with the image of a dead [[Winston Churchill]] rising from his catafalque in Westminster Hall. Brenton's play "offered an imaginative vision of a future in which basic human [[freedom]]s would be curtailed by the state. As so often, a dramatist saw things that others did not".<ref name=Billington />

Brenton's next major success was ''[[Weapons of Happiness]]'', about a strike in a south London factory, commissioned by the National Theatre for its new Lyttelton Theatre and the first commissioned play to be performed at its South Bank home.<ref>Biographical sketch on back of ''Plays for the Poor Theatre'' by Howard Brenton, [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]], 1983 reprint {{ISBN|978-0-413-47080-5}}</ref> Staged by Hare in July 1976, it won the ''Evening Standard'' award for Best Play.

He gained notoriety for his play ''[[The Romans in Britain]]'', first staged at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] in October 1980, which drew parallels between the Roman invasion of Britain in 54BC and the British military presence in Northern Ireland.  But the politics of his play were ignored. Instead a display of moral outrage focused on a scene of attempted anal rape of a Druid priest (played by [[Greg Hicks]]), caught bathing by a Roman centurion (Peter Sproule). This resulted in a private prosecution by [[Mary Whitehouse]] against the play's director, [[Michael Bogdanov]]. But Whitehouse's prosecution was withdrawn by her own legal team when it became obvious that it would not succeed.

The theme of Brenton's 1985 political comedy ''Pravda'', a collaboration with David Hare who also directed, was described by [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]] in ''[[The Guardian]]'' of 3 May 1985 as "the rapacious absorption of chunks of the British press by a tough South African entrepreneur, Lambert Le Roux....superbly embodied by [[Anthony Hopkins]] who utters every sentence with precise Afrikaans over-articulation as if the rest of the world are idiots." The target of the satire was generally accepted to be the Australian international newspaper proprietor [[Rupert Murdoch]] and his [[News International]] empire, but the play's main question mark was about the dangers for society and the state of monopolistic media ownership.

Brenton was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature]] in 2017.<ref>Onwuemezi, Natasha, [http://www.thebookseller.com/news/syal-and-mcdermid-named-new-rsl-fellows-564396 "Rankin, McDermid and Levy named new RSL fellows"], ''[[The Bookseller]]'', 7 June 2017.</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://rsliterature.org/fellows/current-fellows/ | title=Current RSL Fellows | publisher=Royal Society of Literature | access-date=11 June 2017}}</ref>

==Personal life==
He married Jane Margaret Fry in 1970. They have two sons.<ref>Liz Hoggard, "Stage Left", ''The Observer'', 9 October 2005.</ref>
