'''Miroslav Krleža''' ({{IPA-sh|mǐrɔ̝slav̞ kř̩le̞ʒa|pron}}; 7 July 1893 – 29 December 1981) was a Yugoslav and Croatian writer who is widely considered to be the greatest [[Croatian literature|Croatian writer]] of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lzmk.hr/en/miroslav-krleza/494-miroslav-krleza | title=Miroslav Krleža (1893–1981) | work=lzmk.hr | publisher=[[Miroslav Krleža Institute of Lexicography]] | access-date=13 December 2015 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222110123/http://www.lzmk.hr/en/miroslav-krleza/494-miroslav-krleza | archive-date=22 December 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nsk.hr/en/8th-miroslav-krleza-festival/ | title=8th Miroslav Krleža Festival | publisher=[[National and University Library in Zagreb]] | date=18 June 2019 | quote=...undoubtedly the greatest Croatian writer of the 20th century and one of the greatest Croatian writers of all time}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | editor1-first=Aviel |editor1-last=Roshwald |editor2-first=Richard |editor2-last=Stites | title=European Culture in the Great War| publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=2002 | page=201 | quote=By the end of the [First World War], Krleža had established himself as the leading figure of twentieth-century Croatian literature, a position he was never to relinquish.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | editor1-first=Tomáš |editor1-last=Bubík |editor2-first=Atko |editor2-last=Remmel |editor3-first=David |editor3-last=Václavík | title=Freethought and Atheism in Central and Eastern Europe| publisher=Routledge | year=2020 | quote=The greatest literary and cultural figure of the time was Miroslav Krleža, who achieved an enormous literary opus that included the most important texts of 20th-century Croatian literature.}}</ref> He wrote notable works in all the literary genres, including poetry (''[[Ballads of Petrica Kerempuh]]'', 1936), theater (''[[Messrs.

Krleža dominated the cultural life of Croatia and Yugoslavia for half a century.<ref name=Larousse /> A "Communist of his own making",<ref name=Jackson /> he had been severely criticized in [[Communism|Communist]] circles in the 1930s for his refusal to submit to the tenets of [[socialist realism]]. After the [[Second World War]], he held various cultural posts in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Socialist Yugoslavia]], and was most notably the editor of the [[Miroslav Krleža Institute of Lexicography|Yugoslav Lexicographical Institute]] and a constant advisor on cultural affairs to [[Josip Broz Tito|President Tito]]. After the break with [[Stalin]], it was his speech at the 1952 Congress of Yugoslav Writers that signaled a new era of comparative freedom in [[Yugoslav literature (disambiguation)|Yugoslav literature]].<ref>Wachtel, p. 177.</ref>

==Biography==
Miroslav Krleža was born in [[Zagreb]]. He enrolled in a preparatory military school in [[Pécs]], modern-day [[Hungary]]. At that time, Pécs and Zagreb were within the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. Subsequently, he attended the Ludoviceum military academy at [[Budapest]]. He defected to [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] but was dismissed as a suspected spy. Upon his return to Croatia, he was demoted in the [[Austro-Hungarian army]] and sent as a common soldier to the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern front]] in [[World War I]]. In the post-World War I period Krleža established himself both as a major [[Modernism|Modernist]] writer and politically controversial figure in Yugoslavia, a newly created country which encompassed South Slavic lands of the former [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]] and the kingdoms of Serbia and [[Montenegro]].

Krleža was the driving force behind leftist literary and political reviews ''Plamen'' (The Flame) (1919), ''Književna republika'' (Literary Republic)  (1923–1927), ''Danas'' (Today) (1934) and ''Pečat'' (Seal) (1939–1940). He was a member of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] from 1918, expelled in 1939 because of his unorthodox views on art, his defense of artistic freedom against [[Socialist realism#In other states|Socialist realist]] doctrine, and his unwillingness to give open support to the [[Great Purge]], after the long polemic now known as "the Conflict on the Literary Left", pursued by Krleža with virtually every important writer in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, in the period between the two World Wars. The Party commissar sent to mediate between Krleža and other leftist and party journals was [[Josip Broz Tito]].

After the establishment of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] puppet [[Independent State of Croatia]] under [[Ante Pavelić]], Krleža refused to join the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisans]] now headed by Tito.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Following a brief period of social stigmatization after 1945 – during which he nevertheless became a very influential vice-president of the Yugoslav Academy of Science and Arts in Zagreb, while Croatia's principal state publishing house, Nakladni zavod Hrvatske, published his collected works – Krleža was eventually rehabilitated. Supported by Tito, in 1950 Krleža founded the Yugoslav Institute for Lexicography, holding the position as its head until his death. The institute would be posthumously named after him, and is now called the [[Miroslav Krleža Institute of Lexicography]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lzmk.hr/en/from-the-history-of-the-institute | title=From the History of the Institute | date=27 June 2011 | work=lzmk.hr | publisher=[[Miroslav Krleža Institute of Lexicography]] | access-date=13 December 2015 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222101659/http://www.lzmk.hr/en/from-the-history-of-the-institute | archive-date=22 December 2015 }}</ref>

From 1950 on, Krleža led a life of the high-profile writer and intellectual, often closely connected to Tito.  He also briefly held the post of president of the Yugoslav writers' union between 1958 and 1961. In 1962 he received the [[NIN Award]] for the novel ''Zastave'',<ref>{{cite web | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219224832/http://www.b92.net/kultura/knjige/vesti.php?yyyy=2009&mm=01&nav_id=340604 | url=http://www.b92.net/kultura/knjige/vesti.php?yyyy=2009&mm=01&nav_id=340604 | title=Dobitnik NIN-ove nagrade | language=sr | work=b92.net | date=22 January 2009 | archive-date=19 February 2015}}</ref> and in 1968 the [[Herder Prize]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Following the deaths of Tito in May 1980, and Bela Krleža in April 1981, Krleža spent most of his last years of his life in ill health. He was awarded the [[Laureate Of The International Botev Prize]] in 1981. He died in his villa Gvozd in Zagreb, on 29 December 1981 and was given a state funeral in Zagreb on 4 January 1982.<ref>[http://www.mgz.hr/hr/zbirke/memorijalni-prostor-miroslav-i-bela-krleza,2.html Death of Miroslav Krleža] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222203156/http://www.mgz.hr/hr/zbirke/memorijalni-prostor-miroslav-i-bela-krleza%2C2.html |date=2011-12-22 }}, mgz.hr; accessed 19 June 2015.</ref>

==Works==
[[File:Stevan Kragujevic, Tito i Miroslav Krleza, Narodno pozoriste, 100 predstava Fedra.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Krleža with President [[Josip Broz Tito]]]]
Krleža's formative influences include Scandinavian drama, French [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] and Austrian and German [[expressionism]] and modernism, with key authors like [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]], [[August Strindberg|Strindberg]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]], [[Rilke]], and [[Marcel Proust|Proust]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Krleža's opus can be divided into the following categories:

===Poetry===
Although Krleža's lyric poetry is held in high regard, by common critical consensus his greatest poetic work is ''[[Ballads of Petrica Kerempuh|Balade Petrice Kerempuha]]'' (''Ballads of Petrica Kerempuh''), spanning more than five centuries and centred on the figure of plebeian prophet "Petrica Kerempuh", a Croatian [[Till Eulenspiegel]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Novels===
Krleža's novelistic oeuvre consists of four works: ''[[Povratak Filipa Latinovicza]]'' (''[[The Return of Philip Latinowicz]]''), ''Na rubu pameti'' (''On the Edge of Reason''), ''[[Banket u Blitvi]]'' (''[[The Banquet in Blitva]]'') and ''Zastave'' (The Banners). The first one is a novel about an artist, a novel written before Sartre's ''Nausea''. ''On the Edge of Reason'' and ''The Banquet in Blitva'' are essentially political-satires about ideas (the latter located in an imaginary [[Baltic country]] and called a political poem), saturated with the atmosphere of all-pervasive [[totalitarianism]], while ''The Banners'' has rightly been dubbed a "Croatian ''[[War and Peace]]''". It is a multi-volume panoramic view of Croatian (and Central European) society before, during, and after World War I, revolving around the prototypical theme of fathers and sons in conflict. All Krleža's novels except the last one, ''Zastave'' (''The Banners''), have been translated into English.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Short stories and novellas===
The most notable collection of Krleža's short stories is the anti-war book ''[[Hrvatski bog Mars]]'' (''[[Croatian God Mars]]''), on the fates of Croatian soldiers sent to the slaughterhouse of World War I battlefields.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Plays===
Krleža's main artistic interest was centered on drama. He began with experimental expressionist plays like ''Adam i Eva'' and ''Michelangelo Buonarroti'', dealing with defining passions of heroic figures, but eventually opted for more conventional [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalist]] plays. The best known is ''[[Gospoda Glembajevi]]'' (The Glembays), a cycle dealing with the decay of a bourgeois family. ''Golgota'' is another play, political in nature.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Diaries and memoirs===
Krleža's memoirs and diaries (especially ''Davni dani'' (Olden days) and ''Djetinjstvo u Agramu'' (Childhood in Zagreb)) are fascinating documents of growing and expanding self-awareness grappling with the world outside and mutable inner self. Other masterpieces, like ''Dnevnici'' (Diaries) and posthumously published ''Zapisi iz Tržiča'' (Notes from [[Tržič]]) chronicle multifarious impressions (aesthetic, political, literary, social, personal, philosophical) that an inquisitive consciousness has recorded during an era lasting more than half a century.
