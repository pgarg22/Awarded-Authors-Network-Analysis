Okorafor was born in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] in 1974 to [[Igbo (people)|Igbo]] Nigerian parents, who travelled to America in 1969<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/okorafor_nnedi|title=Authors : Okorafor, Nnedi : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|website=www.sf-encyclopedia.com}}</ref> to go to school but could not return to Nigeria because of the [[Nigerian Civil War]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theroot.com/nnedi-okorafor-is-putting-africans-at-the-center-of-sci-1790862186|title=Nnedi Okorafor Is Putting Africans at the Center of Science Fiction and Fantasy|last=Wabuke|first=Hope|work=The Root|access-date=February 23, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> 

During her years attending [[Homewood-Flossmoor High School]] in Flossmoor, IL, Okorafor was a nationally known tennis and track star,<ref name="UB">{{Cite web|url=https://www.buffalo.edu/ubnow/spotlight/profiles-host.host.html/content/shared/university/news/ub-reporter-articles/stories/2016/01/profile_okorafor.detail.html|title=The speculative fiction of UB faculty member Nnedi Okorafor|website=University at Buffalo|access-date=March 4, 2018}}</ref> and excelled in math and the sciences. Due to her interest in insects, she desired to be an entomologist.<ref name="NYTimes" />

She was diagnosed with [[scoliosis]] at the age of 13, a condition that worsened as she grew older. At age 19, she underwent [[spinal fusion]] surgery to straighten and fuse her spine; a rare complication led to Okorafor becoming paralyzed from the waist down.<ref name="UB" />

Okorafor turned to write small stories in the margins of a science-fiction book that she had. It was the first time she had ever written anything creatively. That summer, with intense physical therapy, Okorafor regained her ability to walk, but she was unable to continue her athletic career, using a cane to walk. At the suggestion of a close friend, she took a creative writing class that spring semester and was writing her first novel by the semester's end.<ref name="ChiTrib-2019-05-23">{{cite news

== Influences and themes ==
Okorafor's novels and stories reflect both her West African heritage and her American life. Rather than identifying as Nigerian-American, Okorafor refers to herself as "Naijamerican" and explains the importance of her dual heritage during a 2016 NPR interview: <blockquote>That's very much a part of my identity, and it's also very much a reason why I think I ended up writing science fiction and fantasy because I live on these borders – and these borders that allow me to see from multiple perspectives and kind of take things in and then kind of process certain ideas and certain stories in a very unique way. And that has led me to write this strange fiction that I write, which really isn't that strange if you really look at it through a sort of skewed lens.<ref name="NPR">{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/08/20/490771640/hugo-nominee-nnedi-okorafor-breaks-down-her-sci-fi-writing|title=Hugo Nominee Nnedi Okorafor: 'I Love Stories – And So I Write Them'|work=NPR.org|access-date=November 15, 2017|language=en}}</ref>  </blockquote>Okorafor noticed how the fantasy and science fiction genre contain little diversity, and that was her motivation for writing books of these genres set in Africa. She wanted to include more people of color and create stories with Africa as the setting because so few stories were set there. She wrote her first story as a college sophomore and made the setting of her story Nigeria.<ref name=":1" /> Her stories place black girls in important roles that are usually given to white characters.<ref name="NYTimes" /> Okorafor cites [[Nigeria]] as "her muse" as she is heavily influenced by Nigerian [[folklore]] and its rich mythology and mysticism.<ref name="NYTimes">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/books/ya-fantasy-diverse-akata-warrior.html|title=Nnedi Okorafor and the Fantasy Genre She Is Helping Redefine|last=Alter|first=Alexandra|date=October 6, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 15, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

[[Gary K. Wolfe]] wrote of her work: "Okorafor's genius has been to find the iconic images and traditions of African culture, mostly Nigerian and often [[Igbo people|Igbo]], and tweak them just enough to become a seamless part of her vocabulary of fantastika."<ref>[http://www.locusmag.com/Reviews/2013/12/gary-k-wolfe-reviews-nnedi-okorafor-2/ "Gary K. Wolfe reviews Nnedi Okorafor"], Locus Online, December 22, 2013.</ref>

Her work often looks at "weighty social issues: racial and gender inequality, political violence, the destruction of the environment, genocide and corruption" through "the framework of fantasy."<ref name="NYTimes" />

Okorafor shares that while the themes of her stories are often multi-layered they are always grounded in "stories of the women and girls around me and also within myself."<ref name="NPR" />

Okorafor asserts that her work and parental responsibility relate to each other because "writing and being a mother are a part of me, so they are mixed together and balance each other out."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://strangehorizons.com/non-fiction/articles/the-people-could-fly-an-interview-with-nnedi-okorafor/|first=Ibi|last=Aanu Zoboi|title=The People Could Fly: An Interview with Nnedi Okorafor|date=May 17, 2010|work=Strange Horizons|access-date=February 25, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>

As of 2019, Okorafor began strongly rejecting the term "afrofuturism" as a label for her work and [[Africanfuturism|coined the terms africanfuturism and africanjujuism]] to describe her works. In October 2019, she published an essay titled "Defining Africanfuturism" that defines both terms in detail.<ref name="2019blog">{{Cite web|last=Okorafor|first=Nnedi|title=Africanfuturism Defined|url=https://nnedi.blogspot.com/2019/10/africanfuturism-defined.html|date=October 11, 2019|work=[[Blogspot]]|access-date=February 11, 2021|archive-url=https://archive.today/9k8P3|archive-date=February 11, 2021|url-status=live}}</ref>

== World Fantasy Award ==
Shortly after winning the [[World Fantasy Award]] in 2011, Okorafor published an essay "Lovecraft's racism & The World Fantasy Award statuette, with comments from [[China Miéville]]", in which she reflected upon her conflicting emotions on winning an award in the shape of a large silver bust of [[H. P. Lovecraft]]. Okorafor would later voice her support for [[Daniel José Older]]'s 2014 petition<ref name=Schnelbach>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tor.com/2014/08/20/should-the-world-fantasy-award-be-changed/|title=Should the World Fantasy Award be Changed?|first=Leah|last= Schnelbach|date=August 20, 2014|work=Tor.com|access-date=February 26, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> to replace the Lovecraft bust with one of [[Octavia E. Butler|Octavia Butler]]. In this piece, she acknowledges both the literary legacy of Lovecraft and his continued influence in the contemporary world of science fiction:<blockquote>Do I want "The Howard" (the nickname for the World Fantasy Award statuette. Lovecraft's full name is "Howard Phillips Lovecraft") replaced with the head of some other great writer? Maybe. Maybe it's about that time. Maybe not. What I know I want is to face the history of this leg of literature rather than put it aside or bury it. If this is how some of the great minds of speculative fiction felt, then let's deal with that ... as opposed to never mention it or explain it away.<ref name=Schnelbach /></blockquote>
