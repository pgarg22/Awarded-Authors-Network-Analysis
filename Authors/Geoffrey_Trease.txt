'''(Robert) Geoffrey Trease''' [[FRSL]] (11 August 1909 – 27 January 1998) was a prolific British writer who published 113 books, mainly for children, between 1934 and 1997, starting with ''[[Bows Against the Barons]]'' and ending with ''Cloak for a Spy'' in 1997. His work has been translated into 20 languages. His grandfather was a historian, and was one of the main influences on his work.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} He is best known for the children's novel ''[[Cue for Treason]]'' (1940).

Trease's children's [[historical novels]] reflect his insistence on historically correct backgrounds, which he meticulously researched. His ground-breaking study ''Tales Out of School'' (1949) pioneered the idea that children's literature should be a serious subject for study and debate.<ref name="oxford">[[Humphrey Carpenter]] and Mari Prichard, ''The Oxford Companion to Children's Literature'' Oxford University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|978-0-19-860228-6}} (pp. 541–2).</ref>  When he began his career, his radical viewpoint was a change from the conventional and often [[jingoistic]] tone of most children's literature of the time, and he was one of the first authors who deliberately set out to appeal to both boys and girls and to feature strong leading characters of both sexes.

==Life and work==
Trease was born in [[Nottingham]] in 1909, third and youngest son of George Trease (1873–1932), a wine merchant, and his wife Florence Dale (1874–1955), a doctor's daughter. He won a scholarship to [[Nottingham High School]], where he wrote stories, poems, and a three-act play; awarded a [[Classics]] scholarship to [[Oxford University]], he found his tutors dull and after a year, left university without a degree and moved to London.<ref name="Trease, Geoffrey Robert">{{cite ODNB |last1=Townsend |first1=John Rowe |title=Trease, Geoffrey Robert |date=2009 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/69281 }}</ref> Intent on becoming a writer, he also worked with slum children and joined a left-wing group called the "Promethean Society" whose members included [[Hugh Gordon Porteus]] and [[Desmond Hawkins]].<ref>Desmond Hawkins, ''When I was: a memoir of the years between the wars''
Macmillan, 1989 {{ISBN|0333489683}} (pp. 73–4)</ref><ref>The Promethean Society's key influences included [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]], [[H. G. Wells|Wells]] and [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]]. Trease noted wryly: "We did not worry unduly about reconciling the contradictions". Carpenter and Pritchard, (p. 541).</ref>

Trease described his own childhood reading as "a diet of classist and racist historical adventure" but in 1933, he came across a translation of a Russian book titled ''Moscow has a Plan'', in which a Soviet author dramatised the [[First five-year plan]] for young readers. Inspired by this, in 1934 Trease wrote ''[[Bows Against the Barons]]'', a left-wing update of Robin Hood that showcased a radical approach to historical literature for young people.<ref name="Trease, Geoffrey Robert"/> This included the use of modern English, rather than linguistic mannerisms, strong male and female characters, often from less privileged levels of society and meticulous attention to detail.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Clark |first1=Ann Christine |title=Historical Fiction for Children and Young People: changing fashions, changing forms, changing representations in British writing 1934–2014 |date=2015 |publisher=PHD Thesis for Newcastle University |pages=40–41 |url=https://theses.ncl.ac.uk/dspace/bitstream/10443/3215/1/Clark,%20A.C.%202016.pdf|accessdate=23 September 2018}}</ref> An enduring belief in equality and fairness is a theme in many of his books, as are links between the historical settings of his novels and contemporary issues.

''Bows Against the Barons'' was translated into Russian and sold immensely well there; his next work, ''Comrades for the Charter'' was less successful but ''[[Cue for Treason]]'' in 1940 proved enduringly popular and remains his best known work. His subjects cover a wide range of historical periods, such as ''[[The Crown of Violet]]'', set in [[Ancient Greece]], ''The Red Towers of Granada'', [[Middle Ages]], ''The Hills of Varna'', [[Renaissance|Renaissance Europe]], ''Cue for Treason'' and ''Cloak for a Spy'', [[Elizabethan England]], ''Fire on the Wind'' and ''Popinjay Stairs'', [[English Restoration|Restoration London]], ''Thunder of Valmy'', [[French Revolution]],  ''The White Nights of St Petersburg'', the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] and ''Tomorrow Is a Stranger'', [[World War II]].<ref name="oxford" />

Trease also wrote modern [[school stories]], including the five Black Banner novels set in the [[Lake District]], the first being ''[[No Boats on Bannermere]]''), as well as a number of adult novels, history, plays for radio and television, and biographies. He authored a guide aimed at teaching [[creative writing]] to young adults, ''The Young Writer: A Practical Handbook''.<ref name="oxford" /> He wrote three books of [[autobiography]]: ''A Whiff of Burnt Boats'' (1971), ''Laughter at the Door'' (1974), and in the last year of his life, the final part, ''Farewell the Hills''. This was written for his family and friends, and published privately after his death.

Trease was an acknowledged influence on author [[Hester Burton]] and inspired others, including [[Rosemary Sutcliff]] and [[Leon Garfield]]. While in some ways they outpaced him, he continued to write and published 113 books before "calling it a day" at the age of 88 because of illness.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Clark |first1=Ann Christine |title=Historical Fiction for Children and Young People: changing fashions, changing forms, changing representations in British writing 1934–2014 |date=2015 |publisher=PHD Thesis for Newcastle University |pages=40–41 |url=https://theses.ncl.ac.uk/dspace/bitstream/10443/3215/1/Clark,%20A.C.%202016.pdf|accessdate=23 September 2018}}</ref> Many were translated for foreign markets, including Asia and Europe. In the United States he won the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' Book Award for the Children's Spring Festival 1966 for ''This is Your Century''.

He married Marian Boyer (1906–1989) in 1933 and they spent most of their marriage in [[Colwall]], near [[The Downs School (Herefordshire)|The Downs School]], [[Great Malvern]]. They had one daughter, Jocelyne, and moved to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] to be closer to her, shortly before Marian's death.<ref name="Trease, Geoffrey Robert"/>
