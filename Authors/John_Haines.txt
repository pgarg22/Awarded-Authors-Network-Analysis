Haines was twice the recipient of a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]].  He was appointed the Poet Laureate of Alaska in 1969.<ref>{{cite web |title=Alaska – State Poet Laureate |work=The Library of Congress |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/main/poets/alaska.html |accessdate=2011-03-05}}</ref> A collection of critical essays about his poetry, ''The Wilderness of Vision'', was published in 1998.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Wilderness of Vision: On the Poetry of John Haines |editor1-last=Walzer |editor1-first=Kevin |editor2-last=Bezner |editor2-first=Kevin |publisher=Story Line Press |date=May 1996 |isbn=978-1-885266-22-4 }}</ref> Haines taught graduate-level and honors English classes at the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]]. John A. Murray also conducted a lengthy interview with John Haines in The Bloomsbury Review, July–August 2004. There are discussions of John Haines in Murray's book ''Abbey in America:  A Philosopher's Legacy in a New Century'' (University of New Mexico Press, Jun 15, 2015) in the essay 'The Age of Abbey' and the Afterword.

Haines believed a good poem illuminates for a moment the context which existed before the poem. He had a distinctive voice, a phrasal rhythm, and writing was intensely personal. Haines used direct speech that was plain, suggestive, and memorable metaphors. Haines talked about the harshness of the climate and the relationship between the hunter and the hunted.<ref name=":0" /> Some of Haines’s poetry suggests readers look past the trivial aspects of the physical world and imagine a dreamlike journey. He dissolves temporal boundaries of the natural world, without losing his awareness of the importance of understanding contemporary history, associate’s Dreamtime with elemental activities such as hunting and traveling over the land, showing the continuity of such experience, and its vitality and importance in affirming longstanding human habits of relating to the natural world. Haines' poetry and prose are about his experiences in Alaska and his experiences enlarges our sense of the “pastness if things” while simultaneously rendering the present in sharp detail.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Knott|first=John|date=2006|title=The Dreamtime of John Haines|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44086491|journal=Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment|volume=13|issue=1|pages=147–165|doi=10.1093/isle/13.1.147|jstor=44086491|issn=1076-0962}}</ref>

Haines’ first book, ''Winter News'' used the imagery of death, silence, the relationship between the hunter and the hunted that centers around death. His focus was on the Alaska interior and his dreams and visions. He believed in the human spirit that is existential which is concerned with the here and now. Haines' poems that were published in 1966 showcased his thoughts towards an existential spirit. The rhythm and positioning or spacing of lines Haines’ in the 48 poems if ''Winter News'' contained no more than 4-stresses. 27 of the poems have a 2-stresses rhythm, fourteen are essentially 3-stress, and seven of the poems are almost evenly divided between two and three stresses per line.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kevin.|first=Bezner|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/633872887|title=The wilderness of vision: on the poetry of John Haines|date=1996|publisher=Story Line Press|isbn=1-885266-22-7|oclc=633872887}}</ref> 

In ''The Stone Harp,'' Haines wrote against the background of the Vietnam War. In “Rain Country,” he evokes experiences of thirty years before defined by intimacy with the natural world. The “In the Forest Without Leave,” Haines juxtaposes surreal imagines devastated by future catastrophe to others that suggest the restoration of a simpler and satisfying way of being in the world regulated by natural rhythms.<ref name=":1" />
