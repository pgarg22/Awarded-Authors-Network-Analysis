'''Roger Martin du Gard''' ({{IPA-fr|dy gaʁ|lang}}; 23 March 1881 – 22 August 1958) was a French novelist, winner of the 1937 [[Nobel Prize for Literature]].

==Biography==
Trained as a paleographer and archivist, he brought to his works a spirit of objectivity and a scrupulous regard for detail, and because of his concern with documentation and the relationship of social reality to individual development, his fiction has been linked with the [[Literary realism|realist]] and [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalist]] traditions of the 19th century. His sympathy for the humanist [[socialism]] and pacifism of [[Jean Jaurès]] is evident in his work.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jouejati |first1=R. |title=The Quest for Total Peace: The Political Thought of Roger Martin Du Gard |date=2005 |publisher=Routledge |pages=92–93}}</ref>

He is best known for ''[[The Thibaults]]'', a multi-volume ''[[roman fleuve]]'' which follows the fortunes of two brothers, Antoine and Jacques Thibault, from their upbringing in a prosperous Catholic bourgeois family to the end of the [[World War I]]. Six parts of the novel were published between 1922 and 1929. After abandoning a seventh volume in manuscript, he published two more volumes in 1936 and 1940. Written under the shadow of the darkening international situation in Europe in the 1930s, these last parts, which together are longer than the previous six combined, focus on the political and historical situation leading up to the outbreak of the First World War and bring the story to 1918.

Martin du Gard wrote several other novels, including ''Jean Barois'', which was set against the historical context of the [[Dreyfus Affair]]. During [[World War II]], he resided in [[Nice]], where he prepared a novel ''(Souvenirs du lieutenant-colonel de Maumort)'' which remained unfinished at his death.  It was posthumously published in 1983. His other works include plays and a memoir of [[André Gide]], a longtime friend.

Roger Martin du Gard died in 1958 and was buried in the Cimiez Monastery Cemetery in [[Cimiez]], a suburb of the city of [[Nice, France]].
