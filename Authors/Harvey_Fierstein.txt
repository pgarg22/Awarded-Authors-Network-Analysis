==Early life and education==
Fierstein was born in [[Bensonhurst, Brooklyn]], New York City, the son of Jacqueline Harriet ({{née}} Gilbert), a school librarian, and Irving Fierstein, a [[handkerchief]] manufacturer.<ref>{{cite news| title=Harvey Fierstein Biography| url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/68/Harvey-Fierstein.html| work=filmreference | year=2008| access-date=2008-06-11}}</ref> He was raised Jewish, but later rejected the faith and became an [[atheist]].<ref name="Harvey Fierstein">{{cite news| quote="I mean, I don't believe in God, I don't believe in heaven or hell, but I pray three or four times a day."| last=McKinley| first =Jesse| title =Fierstein As Tevye: Sounds Crazy, No?| pages=2–5| newspaper=[[The New York Times]]| date=2005-01-02| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/02/theater/newsandfeatures/02mcki.html}}</ref>

Fierstein attended [[High School of Art and Design]] and received a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|BFA]] from the [[Pratt Institute]] in 1973. He began working in the theater as a founding member of The Gallery Players of Park Slope before being cast in [[Andy Warhol]]'s only play, ''[[Andy Warhol's Pork|Pork]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Harvey Fierstein|url=https://www.concordtheatricals.com/a/1710/harvey-fierstein|access-date=2021-01-26|website=Concord Theatricals}}</ref>

Fierstein's signature gravelly voice is a result of an overdeveloped [[vestibular fold]] in his vocal cords, essentially giving him a "double voice" when he speaks. Prior to puberty, Fierstein was a [[soprano]] in a professional boys' choir.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/harvey-fierstein-no-longer-an-activist/| work=CBS News| title=Harvey Fierstein: No longer an activist| first=Richard| last=Schlesinger| date=June 9, 2013| access-date=April 10, 2018}}</ref>
