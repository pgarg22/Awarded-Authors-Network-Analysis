'''Charlotte Mary Yonge''' (1823–1901) was an English novelist, who wrote in the service of the church. Her abundant books helped to spread the influence of the [[Oxford Movement]] and show her keen interest in matters of public health and sanitation. Her work is mostly out of print.

==Life==
Charlotte Mary Yonge was born in [[Otterbourne]], Hampshire, England, on 11 August 1823 to William Yonge and Fanny Yonge, ''née'' Bargus.{{sfn |Hayter |1996 |p=vii}} She was educated at home by her father, studying Latin, Greek, French, [[Euclid]], and algebra.{{sfn |Coleridge |1903 |pp=107–108}} Her father's lessons could be harsh:
<blockquote>
He required a diligence and accuracy that were utterly alien to me. He thundered at me so that nobody could bear to hear it, and often reduced me to tears, but his approbation was so delightful that it was a delicious stimulus.... I believe, in spite of all breezes over my innate slovenliness, it would have broken our hearts to leave off working together. And we went on till I was some years past twenty.{{sfn |Coleridge |1903 |p=108}}
</blockquote>

Yonge's devotion to her father was lifelong and her relations with him seem to have set the standard for all other relations, including marriage.{{sfn |Sturrock |1995 |pp=17–18}} His "approbation was throughout life my bliss; his anger my misery for the time."<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb |Sturrock |1995 |p=17}}.</ref>

Yonge was born into a religious family. Devoted to the High Church, she was much influenced by [[John Keble]], Vicar of [[Hursley]] from 1835, a near neighbour and one of the leaders of the [[Oxford Movement]]. Yonge was herself sometimes referred to as "the novelist of the Oxford Movement",{{sfn |Dennis |1992}} as her work frequently reflects values and concerns of [[Anglo-Catholicism]]. She remained in Otterbourne all her life and taught for 71 years in the village [[Sunday school]].{{sfn |Cross |1957 |p=1484}} Her house, ''Elderfield'', became a Grade 2 listed building in 1984.

In 1868 a new parish was formed to the south of Yonge's home village of Otterbourne. This was to contain the villages of Eastley and Barton. Yonge donated £500 towards the [[parish church]] and was asked to choose which of the two villages the parish should be named after. She chose Eastley, but decided that it should be spelt ''[[Eastleigh]]'' as she perceived this as being more modern.<ref name="lambert">{{Cite web |last=Lambert |first=Tim |title=A Brief History of Eastleigh |url=http://www.localhistories.org/eastleigh.html |website=A World History Encyclopedia |access-date=7 September 2008}}</ref>

Yonge died in her home town of Otterbourne on 24 May 1901. Her obituary in ''[[The Times]]'' stated,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Charlotte Yonge: Her Life and Context |url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/c.e.schultze/context/obituary.html |publisher=Charlotte Mary Yonge Fellowship |access-date=16 December 2017}}</ref>
<blockquote>
Her friends, and especially her poorer neighbours, knew both the strength and the winning charm of her character. Thus the late Archbishop Benson noted in his diary her "odd majesty and kindliness, which are very strong."

But it is of course as a writer that Miss Yonge will be remembered. She had an inventive mind and a ready pen, and a bare list of the books written or edited by her would probably occupy nearly a whole column of ''The Times''. She wrote chiefly for young people, especially young girls, and her books are the result not only of a strong ethical purpose, but also of her firm devotion to the High Church view of Christian doctrine and practice.
</blockquote>

==Literary career==
Yonge began writing in 1848 and published in her long life about 160 works, chiefly novels.{{sfn |Cross |1957 |p=1484}} Her first commercial success, ''[[The Heir of Redclyffe]]'' (1853), provided the funding to put the schooner ''[[Southern Cross (Melanesian Mission ship series)|Southern Cross]]'' into service on behalf of [[George Augustus Selwyn|George Selwyn]]. Similar charitable works were done with the profits from later novels. Yonge was also a founder and editor for 40 years of ''[[Monthly Packet|The Monthly Packet]]'', a magazine founded in 1851, with a varied readership, but targeted at British Anglican girls, though in later years it turned to a somewhat wider readership).<ref name=gos/>

[[File:Picture of Charlotte Mary Yonge.jpg|thumb|Charlotte Mary Yonge later in life]]
Among her other well-known works are ''Heartsease'', and ''The Daisy Chain''. ''A Book of Golden Deeds'' is a collection of true stories of courage and self-sacrifice. Other titles were ''Cameos from English History'', ''Life of [[John Coleridge Patteson]]: Missionary Bishop of the Melanesian Islands'', and ''[[Hannah More]]''. Her ''History of Christian Names'' was described as "the first serious attempt at tackling the subject" and as the standard work on names in the preface to the first edition of Withycombe's ''The Oxford Dictionary of English Christian Names'' (1944).

Around 1859 Yonge created a literary group of younger girl cousins, to write essays and gain advice from Yonge on their writing. Together they created a private magazine, ''The Barnacle'', which continued until about 1871. This was valuable as they may have belonged to the last generation of girls educated at home.<ref name="NelsonVallone2010">{{Cite book |author1=Claudia Nelson |author2=Lynne Vallone |title=The Girl's Own: Cultural Histories of the Anglo-American Girl, 1830-1915 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HYleSwnEuRQC&pg=PA77 |date=1 June 2010 |publisher=University of Georgia Press |isbn=978-0-8203-3695-4 |pages=72–79}}</ref> Her goddaughter, [[Alice Mary Coleridge]], contributed as "Gurgoyle" to the first issue, drawing the covers and contributing translations, articles and verses.<ref name=gos/>

Yonge's personal example and influence on her goddaughter Alice Mary Coleridge were formative in her zeal for women's education, leading indirectly to the foundation of [[Abbots Bromley School for Girls]].<ref name=gos>Chancellor, V. (2004-09-23). Coleridge, Alice Mary (1846–1907), promoter of girls' schools. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Retrieved 22 December 2017.

After Yonge's death, her friend, assistant and collaborator, [[Christabel Coleridge]], published the biographical ''Charlotte Mary Yonge: her Life and Letters'' (1903).

==Reputation==
Yonge's work was widely read and respected in the 19th century. Among her admirers were [[Lewis Carroll]], [[George Eliot]], [[William Ewart Gladstone]], [[Charles Kingsley]], [[Christina Rossetti]], [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]], and [[Anthony Trollope]].{{sfn |Hayter |1996 |p=1}} [[William Morris]] and [[Edward Burne-Jones]] read ''[[The Heir of Redclyffe]]'' aloud to each other while undergraduates at Oxford University and "took [the hero, Guy Morville's] medieval tastes and chivalric ideals as presiding elements in the formation of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]]."{{sfn |Hayter |1996 |p=2}} Yonge's work was compared favourably with that of Trollope, [[Jane Austen]], [[Honoré de Balzac]], [[Gustave Flaubert]], and [[Émile Zola]].{{sfn |Hayter |1996 |p=2}}

[[John Marriott (British politician)|Sir John Arthur Ransome Marriott]] called her:
<blockquote>
... not only a prolific novelist, but a serious student of history, especially in its personal aspects. Having dealt in ''The Constable's Tower'' with Hubert de Burgh, with his famous defence of Dover Castle against Prince Louis of France (1213), and his still more famous victory at sea off Sandwich, and with Edward I as a crusader (''The Prince and the Page''), Miss Yonge drew on the ''Vie de Bertrand du Guesclin'' as well as on Froissart for her fascinating tale ''The Lances of Lynwood''. With characteristic modesty she expressed the hope that her sketch might "serve as an inducement to some young readers to make acquaintance with the delectable old Canon (Froissart) for themselves." The wise, of all ages, will fulfil her hope.{{sfn |Marriott |1940 |p=68}}
</blockquote>

So popular were her works that
<blockquote>
A [[midshipman]] was able to supply from memory a missing page in his ship's copy of ''The Daisy Chain''. An officer in the Guards, asked in a game of "Confessions" what his prime object in life was, answered that it was to make himself like Guy Morville, hero of ''The Heir of Redclyffe''.{{sfn |Hayter |1996 |pp=1–2}}
</blockquote>

[[C. S. Lewis]] thought highly of her, at one point bracketing her evocations of domestic life with those of [[Homer]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]].{{sfn |Lewis |1949 |p=31}} [[Abraham Kuyper]], who read ''The Heir of Redclyffe'' on the recommendation of his fiancé, Johanna Schaay, found it a moving experience. The novel was "next to the [[Bible]] in its meaning for my life."{{sfn |Kuyper |1998 |p=51}}

However, according to the critic Catherine Sandbach-Dahlström, Yonge's work has been "constantly be-devilled" by a "tendency to confuse the moral quality of [her] view of life with the quality of her literary expression".{{sfn |Sandbach-Dahlström |1984 |p=3}}

Her novels such as ''The Daisy Chain'', ''The Young Stepmother'', ''The Trial'', and ''The Three Brides'' encompass Victorian problems of urban pollution, sanitary reform, and epidemics of cholera and typhoid. She urged social, economic and medical reform of dirt-ridden Victorian cities. The dualism found in her writings, writes Alethea Hayter, "serves to illustrate the triumphs and mistakes of reforming zeal, to contrast selfish irresponsibility with courageous philanthropy, to balance tradition against progress."<ref>Alethea Hayter, "The Sanitary Idea and a Victorian Novelist", ''History Today'' (1969) 19 12, pp. 840–847.</ref>

Yonge's work has been sparely studied, with the possible exception of ''The Heir of Redclyffe''.{{sfn |Sandbach-Dahlström |1984 |p=8}}

[[Graham Greene]] used [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraphs]] from ''The Little Duke'' for each chapter of his 1943 novel [[The Ministry of Fear]]. In Chapter 1, the protagonist Arthur Rowe buys a copy of the book at a fête for sixpence.

In 2015 a sculpture by [[Vivien Mallock]] was installed outside [[Eastleigh railway station]],<ref>{{Cite book |last=Calcutt |first=Joanne |url=https://www.eastleigh.gov.uk/media/2274/publicartstratv4.pdf |title=Public Art Strategy 2015-2019 |publisher=Eastleigh Borough Council |year=2015 |pages=33, 81 & 93}}</ref> as a tribute to Yonge for having effectively named the town. It shows her at the age of about 45, when she named Eastleigh parish. It shows her sitting on a bench with a book on her lap, with space for members of the public to sit alongside her.
