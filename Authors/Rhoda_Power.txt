'''Rhoda Dolores Le Poer Power''' (29 May 1890 in [[Altrincham]], [[Cheshire]] – 9 March 1957 in London), was a pioneer English broadcaster and children's writer. The highly regarded set of stories that make up ''Redcap Runs Away'' (1952) are set in the Middle Ages and told by a runaway minstrel boy.

==Life and career==
The daughter of Philip Ernest Le Poer Power (born 1860), a stockbroker, and Mabel Grindley, née Clegg (1866–1903), Rhoda Power and her sisters [[Eileen Power|Eileen]] (1889–1940), who became a historian, and [[Beryl Power|Beryl]] (1891–1974), who joined the civil service,<ref>{{Cite ODNB|title=Power, Beryl Millicent Le Poer (1891–1974), civil servant|url=https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-45653|access-date=2020-12-01|year = 2004|language=en|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/45653|isbn = 978-0-19-861412-8}}</ref> were raised by their maternal grandfather and three aunts, after their father was convicted of fraud in 1891 and he went to prison for five years.

Rhoda Power attended [[Oxford High School (Oxford)|Oxford High School]], run by the [[Girls' Day School Trust|Girls' Public Day School Trust]]. She then read modern languages, economics and political economy at [[St. Andrews University]] in Scotland (1911–1913).<ref name="Girton" >Girton College Archive, Cambridge, UK, Personal Papers of Rhoda Power, GCPP Power, R.

After a year in the United States, Power worked as a freelance journalist in several European countries. In 1917, she became governess to the daughter of a business family in [[Rostov-on-Don]], Russia, where she became caught up in the [[October Revolution]]. An illness she caught there may have triggered the progressive deafness from which she began to suffer.

Power started to write history books for children in the 1920s, with her sister Eileen and later independently. In 1927 she began a career as a broadcaster with the [[BBC]]. She moved with the school broadcasting department to [[Bristol]] in 1939 and worked there for the rest of her life, apart from a year spent travelling in the Americas in 1946–1947. In 1950 she was awarded an [[Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire|MBE]] for her work.<ref name="Girton" />

==''Redcap Runs Away''==
Power's book of stories ''Redcap Runs Away'', illustrated by [[C. Walter Hodges]], has become a children's classic, although one in danger of being forgotten today.<ref>For Penelope Wilcock, a fellow historical novelist for children, it is one of her two favourite books in the genre: "Redcap Runs Away by Rhoda Power, first published in 1952: and Peter Abelard by Helen Waddell, first published in 1933 and still-–still!-–available both used and new..." [http://www.novelpastimes.com/2008/01/interview-with-penelope-wilcock.html Retrieved 25 February 2016.]</ref> It tells the story of a 10-year-old boy who takes up with a band of [[minstrels]] in the 14th century. As an anonymous reviewer in the [[Melbourne]] newspaper ''[[The Age]]'' put it in 1957, Redcap's adventures make "a peg on which to hang the stories the people used to hear in the market places and inns 600 years ago.... Miss Power has collected them from authentic sources and they still make very good reading."<ref>''The Age'', Melbourne, 7 June 1957, p. 12. Junior Age: Let's Read Some Fancy-Dress Books!</ref>

The book joined the prominent UK [[List of early Puffin Story Books|Puffin Story Books]] list in that year, as a selection of [[Eleanor Graham]], the senior series editor. Writing in the Puffin fan magazine ''Junior Bookshelf'' for 1952–1953, Graham wrote, "I have only praise and the highest praise" for the book, which "stands head and shoulders above its contemporaries." It was "a story which, if I am not mistaken, will set a new standard for us in children's stories."

The delineation of the characters and plot drew upon Rhoda's experience in schools' broadcasting, in which her forte was the dramatization of history for younger listeners. Her grasp of the social history of medieval England owes much to her older sister, the historian Eileen Power, who before her early death in 1940 had collaborated with Rhoda in preparing scripts for broadcasting on the BBC. Among these had been a story about life in a medieval village, told from the standpoint of Simon, a serf who had fled from a nearby manor. This story may have suggested the framework for ''Redcap Runs Away''.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} However, English literary concern with minstrelsy has been continual since the [[Romanticism|Romantic period]]: poems such as Sir [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[The Lay of the Last Minstrel]]'' (1805) and [[John Clare]]'s ''The Village Minstrel'' (1821), and novels like [[Helen Craik]]'s ''Henry of Northumberland'' (1800), [[Sydney Owenson]]'s ''The Novice of St. Dominick'' (a girl flees disguised as a minstrel, 1805), and more recently, [[Christabel Rose Coleridge]]'s ''Minstrel Dick'' (a boy minstrel becomes a courtier, 1891) and [[Howard Spring]]'s ''Darkie and Co.'' (a boy runs away from an unhappy home to join a travelling show, 1932).

The inclusion of so many minstrel stories in ''Redcap'' adds to the book's authenticity, but not all US critics at the time viewed this favourably. Commenting on the 1954 US edition, ''The Bulletin of the Children's Book Center'' wrote that "because of the many stories which have been included (one to each chapter) the plot moves slowly, and reading is further hampered by the extremely poor format, with its small type, crowded lines, and poor paper."<ref>Vol. VII/10, June 1954, p. 89.
