'''Seán O'Casey''' ({{lang-ga|Seán Ó Cathasaigh}} {{IPA-ga|ˈʃaːn̪ˠ oː ˈkahəsˠiː|}}; born '''John Casey'''; 30 March 1880 – 18 September 1964) was an Irish dramatist and memoirist. A committed socialist, he was the first Irish playwright of note to write about the [[Dublin]] working classes.

== Early life ==
O'Casey was born at 85 Upper [[Dorset Street, Dublin|Dorset Street]], [[Dublin]], as John Casey, the son of Michael Casey, a mercantile clerk (who worked for the [[Irish Church Missions]]), and Susan Archer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://civilrecords.irishgenealogy.ie/churchrecords/details-civil/0e7d4c0983945|title=General Registrar's Office|website=IrishGenealogy.ie|access-date=30 March 2017}}</ref> His parents were Protestants and he was a member of the [[Church of Ireland]], baptised on 28 July 1880 in St. Mary's parish,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://churchrecords.irishgenealogy.ie/churchrecords/details/e30bb50146016|title=Church records|website=IrishGenealogy.ie|access-date=30 March 2017}}</ref> confirmed at [[Church of Ireland Parish of Clontarf|St John the Baptist Church]] in [[Clontarf, Dublin|Clontarf]],<ref name="centenaryessays">

There is a church called 'Saint Burnupus' in his play ''[[Red Roses For Me]]''.

O'Casey's father died <!-- A source is needed for this: "as the result of a spinal injury" --> when Seán was just six years of age, leaving a family of thirteen.<ref name="centenaryessays"/> The family lived a peripatetic life thereafter, moving from house to house around north Dublin. As a child, he suffered from poor eyesight, which interfered somewhat with his early education, but O'Casey taught himself to read and write by the age of thirteen.

He left school at fourteen and worked at a variety of jobs, including a nine-year period as a railwayman on the [[Great Northern Railway (Ireland)|GNR]]. O'Casey worked in [[Eason & Son|Eason's]] for a short while, in the newspaper distribution business, but was sacked for not taking off his cap when collecting his wage packet.<ref>LM Cullen, Eason and Son, A History.<!-- Additional information is needed for this ref. --></ref>

From the early 1890s, O'Casey and his elder brother, Archie, put on performances of plays by [[Dion Boucicault]] and [[William Shakespeare]] in the family home. He also got a small part in Boucicault's ''The Shaughraun'' in the [[Mechanics' Theatre]], which stood on what was to be the site of the [[Abbey Theatre]].

== Politics ==
As his interest in the [[Irish nationalist]] cause grew, O'Casey joined the [[Gaelic League]] in 1906 and learned the [[Irish language]]. At this time, he Gaelicised his name from John Casey to Seán Ó Cathasaigh. He also learned to play the [[Uilleann pipes]] and was a founder and secretary of the [[St. Laurence O'Toole Pipe Band]]. He joined the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Christopher|title=Seán O'Casey: writer at work : a biography |publisher=Gill & Macmillan Ltd|year=2004|pages=66|isbn=978-0-7171-2750-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oozbw4RuwocC&q=%22it+would+not+be+too+much+to+say+John+Casey+became+a+fanatic+for+all+things+Irish%22&pg=PA66|access-date=29 October 2011}}</ref> and became involved in the [[Irish Transport and General Workers Union]], which had been established by [[Jim Larkin]] to represent the interests of the unskilled labourers who inhabited the Dublin tenements. He participated in the [[Dublin Lockout]] but was blacklisted and could not find steady work for some time.

In March 1914, he became General Secretary of Larkin's [[Irish Citizen Army]], which would soon be run by [[James Connolly]]. On 24 July 1914 he resigned from the ICA, after his proposal to deny dual membership to both the ICA and the [[Irish Volunteers]] was rejected.

One of his first satirical ballads, "The Grand Oul' Dame Britannia", was published in ''The Workers' Republic'' on 15 January 1916 under his penname An Gall Fada.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Christopher|title=Sean O'Casey: Writer at Work : a Biography|date=2004|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press-MQUP|page=106}}</ref>

== After Easter Rising ==
[[File:Portrait of Seán O'Casey .PNG|left|thumb|portrait by Augustus John, 1926 ]]
In 1917, his friend [[Thomas Ashe]] died in a hunger strike and it inspired him to write. He wrote two laments: one in verse and a longer one in prose.<ref name="Ayling 1982">{{cite book|last=Ayling|first=Ronald|title=Modern British Dramatists, 1900–1945.|year=1982|publisher=Gale|location=[[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]|isbn=978-0-8103-0937-1|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/modernbritishdra10iogr}}</ref> Ballads authored around this time by O'Casey featured in the two editions of ''Songs of the Wren'', published in 1918; these included "The Man from the Daily Mail", which, along with "The Grand Oul' Dame Britannia", became [[Irish rebel music]] staples. A common theme was opposition to Irish conscription into the British Army during the [[First World War]].

He spent the next five years writing plays. In 1918, when both his sister and mother died (in January and September, respectively), the St Laurence O'Toole National Club commissioned him to write the play ''The Frost in the Flower''. He had been in the St Laurence O'Toole Pipe Band and played on the [[hurling]] team.  The club declined to put the play on out of fear that its satirical treatment of several parishioners would cause resentment.  O'Casey then submitted the play to the Abbey Theatre, which also rejected it but encouraged him to continue writing.  Eventually, O'Casey expanded the play to three acts and retitled it ''The Harvest Festival''.

== Abbey Theatre ==
[[Image:SeanOCaseyHouse.jpg|thumb|No. 422 [[R101 road (Ireland)|North Circular Road]], the house where O'Casey wrote the Dublin trilogy]]
O'Casey's first accepted play, ''[[The Shadow of a Gunman]]'', was performed at the [[Abbey Theatre]] in 1923. This was the beginning of a relationship that was to be fruitful for both theatre and dramatist but which ended in some bitterness.

The play deals with the impact of revolutionary politics on Dublin's slums and their inhabitants, and is understood to be set in [[Mountjoy Square]], where he lived during the 1916 [[Easter Rising]]. It was followed by ''[[Juno and the Paycock]]'' (1924) and ''[[The Plough and the Stars]]'' (1926). The former deals with the effect of the [[Irish Civil War]] on the working class poor of the city, while the latter is set in Dublin in 1916 around the [[Easter Rising]]. Both plays deal realistically with the rhetoric and dangers of Irish patriotism, with tenement life, self-deception, and survival; they are tragi-comedies in which violent death throws into relief the blustering masculine bravado of characters such as Jack Boyle and Joxer Daly in ''Juno and the Paycock'' and the heroic resilience of Juno herself or of Bessie Burgess in ''The Plough and the Stars''.<ref>''The Oxford Companion to English Literature, 6th Edition''. Edited by Margaret Drabble, Oxford University Press, 2000 Pp 734</ref> ''Juno and the Paycock'' became [[Juno and the Paycock (film)|a film]] directed by [[Alfred Hitchcock]].

''The Plough and the Stars'' was not well received by the Abbey audience and resulted in scenes reminiscent of the riots that greeted [[John Millington Synge|J. M. Synge]]'s ''[[The Playboy of the Western World]]'' in 1907. There was a riot reported on the fourth night of the show. His depiction of sex and religion even offended some of the actors, who refused to speak their lines. The full-scale riot occurred partly because the play was thought to be an attack on the men in the rising and partly in protest in opposition to the animated appearance of a prostitute in Act 2.<ref>{{cite book |title=Contemporary Authors Online|url=https://archive.org/details/contemporaryauth0209unse|url-access=registration|year=2003 |publisher=Gale|location=[[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]] |isbn=978-0-7876-3995-2}}</ref> [[William Butler Yeats|W. B. Yeats]] got onto the stage and roared at the audience: "You have disgraced yourselves again."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hogan |first1=Robert |last2=Burnham |first2=Richard |title=The Years of O'Casey, 1921-1926: A Documentary History |date=1992 |publisher=University of Delaware Press |location=Newark |isbn=978-0874134216 |page=281 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZGUux-s69UoC&pg=PA281 |access-date=18 August 2018}}</ref> The takings of the play were substantial compared with the previous week. O'Casey gave up his job and became a full-time writer.

After the incident, even though the play was well liked by most of the Abbey goers, [[Liam O'Flaherty]], [[Austin Clarke (poet)|Austin Clarke]] and [[F. R. Higgins]] launched an attack against it in the press. O'Casey believed it was an attack on Yeats, that they were using O'Casey's play to berate Yeats.

In 1952 he appeared in a play by Irish playwright [[Teresa Deevy]] called "The Wild Goose"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://deevy.nuim.ie/items/show/342|title=The Wild Goose|work=The Teresa Deevy Archive|access-date=14 July 2016}}</ref> in which he played the part of Father Ryan. O'Casey was involved in numerous productions with the Abbey; these can be found in the Abbey Archives.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.abbeytheatre.ie/archives/person_detail/12870|title=O'Casey, Sean (I)|work=The Abbey Theatre Archive|access-date=14 July 2016}}</ref>

== England ==
While in London to receive the Hawthornden Prize and supervise the West End production of ''Juno and the Paycock'', O'Casey fell in love with Eileen Carey. The couple were married in 1927 and remained in London until 1938,<ref>Krause, David ''Sean O'Casey and his world'', London: Thames & Hudson, 1976</ref> when they moved to [[Totnes]].

In 1928, W. B. Yeats rejected O'Casey's fourth play, ''[[The Silver Tassie (play)|The Silver Tassie]]'' for the Abbey. It was an attack on imperialist wars and the suffering they cause. The Abbey refused to perform it. The premier production was funded by [[Charles B. Cochran]], who took only eighteen months to put it on stage. It was put up at the [[Apollo Theatre]] but lasted for only twenty-six performances. It was directed by [[Raymond Massey]], starred [[Charles Laughton]] and with an Act II set design by [[Augustus John]]. [[George Bernard Shaw]] and [[Augusta, Lady Gregory|Lady Gregory]] had a favourable opinion of the show.

[[Denis Johnston]], who knew O'Casey and spent time with him in London in the 1920s, is certain that the Abbey was right not to stage ''The Silver Tassie''. “Its expressionist second act was at that time far beyond the scope of the Abbey Theatre."<ref>[[Denis Johnston]] "Sean O'Casey in the Twenties". In O hAodha, Micheal (ed). ''The O'Casey Enigma''. Dublin: Mercier Press, 1980, p. 31.</ref> A year later Johnston’s own ''The Old Lady Says “No!"'' was similarly rejected, for the same reason. Nevertheless O’Casey’s resentment over this persisted for many years.

[[File:Sean O'Casey by Reginald Gray.jpg|thumb|Study of Seán O'Casey by Dublin artist [[Reginald Gray (artist)|Reginald Gray]], for the ''New York Times'' (1966)]]
The plays O'Casey wrote after this included the darkly allegorical ''Within the Gates'' (1934), which is set within the gates of a busy city park based on London's [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]]. Although it was highly controversial, [[Eugene O'Neill]] responded positively to it. The play was originally going to be a film script for [[Alfred Hitchcock]]. O'Casey's widow described it in her memoirs, ''Sean'' (1971):<blockquote>"Originally he had imagined it as a film in which everything, from flower-beds to uniforms, would be stylised. Beginning at dawn and ending at midnight, to the soft chime of [[Big Ben]] in the distance, it would be 'geometrical and emotional, the emotions of the living characters to be shown against their own patterns and the patterns of the Park.' Having got so far, he wrote to Alfred Hitchcock, and when Hitchcock and his wife dined with us Sean explained his ideas to an apparently responsive hearer. Hitchcock and he talked excitedly. They parted on the same terms, with the prospect of another immediate meeting, and Sean never heard again."<ref name="Ayling 1982"/></blockquote>

The play was unsuccessful in Northern Ireland and was not produced in the south until 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dublinlyric.ie/pp_Within_the_Gates.html|title=Within the Gates|publisher=Dublin Lyric Theatre}}</ref> In the autumn of 1934, O'Casey went to the United States to visit the New York City production of ''Within the Gates'', which he admired greatly. It was directed by actor [[Melvyn Douglas]] and starred [[Lillian Gish]]. This is when he befriended [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[Sherwood Anderson]] and [[George Jean Nathan]].<ref name="Ayling 1982"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://lilliangish1893.com/within-the-gates-1934/|title=Within The Gates 1934|date=8 September 2018|publisher=LillianGish1893}}</ref>

''The Star Turns Red'' (1940) is a four-act political allegory in which the [[Star of Bethlehem]] turns red. The story follows Big Red (who was based on O'Casey's friend, [[James Larkin]]) who is a trade-union leader. The union takes over the unnamed country despite the ruthless efforts of the Saffron Shirts, a fascist organisation openly supported by the Roman Catholic hierarchy of the country. It was staged by [[Unity Theatre, London|Unity Theatre]] in London during 1940 (later, in 1978 by the Abbey in Dublin).

''Purple Dust'' (1943) follows two wealthy, materialistic English stockbrokers who buy an ancient Irish mansion and attempt to restore it with their wrong notions of [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor]] customs and taste. They try to impose upon a community with vastly different customs and lifestyles that are much closer to ancient Gaelic ways and are against such false values.[[File:Sean O'Casey childhood home.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Sean O' Casey home.|Seán O'Casey's childhood home. Upper Dorset Street, Dublin.]]

The Englishmen set their opposing standards against those represented by the men employed to renovate the house. In the resulting confrontation the English are satirised and in the end disappointed when a symbolic storm destroys their dream of resettling the old into the present. The hint that is enforced by the conclusion is that the little heap of purple dust that remains will be swept away by the rising winds of change, like the residue of pompous imperialism that abides in Ireland. The show has been compared to Shaw's [[John Bull's Other Island]], which was one of O'Casey's favourites, but aside from a few similarities, there are no real grounds for comparison.<ref name="Ayling 1982"/>

He also penned ''[[Red Roses for Me (play)|Red Roses for Me]]'' (1943), which saw him move away from his early style in favour of more [[expressionism|expressionistic]] means and overtly socialist content to his writing. It went up at Dublin's [[Olympia Theatre, Dublin|Olympia Theatre]] (which was the first one produced in Ireland in seventeen years). It would move on to London in 1946, where O'Casey himself was able to see it. This was the first show of his own he saw since ''Within The Gates'' in 1934.<ref name="Ayling 1982"/>

''Oak Leaves and Lavender'' (1945) is a propaganda play commemorating the [[Battle of Britain]] and [[UK|Britain's]] heroism in the anti-Nazi crusade and it takes place in a manor with shadowy 18th-century figures commenting on the present.<ref name="Ayling 1982"/>

These plays have never had the same critical or popular success as the early trilogy. After the Second World War he wrote ''[[Cock-a-Doodle Dandy]]'' (1949), which is perhaps his most beautiful and exciting work. From ''The Bishop's Bonfire'' (1955) O'Casey's late plays are studies on the common life in Ireland, "Irish microcosmos", like ''The Drums of Father Ned'' (1958).

His play ''The Drums of Father Ned'' was supposed to go up at the 1958 [[Dublin Theatre Festival]], but the [[Archbishop of Dublin (Roman Catholic)|Catholic Archbishop of Dublin]], [[John Charles McQuaid]], refused to give his blessing (it has been assumed because works of both [[James Joyce]] and O'Casey were in the festival). After Joyce's play was quietly dropped, massive changes were required for ''The Drums of Father Ned'', a devious way to get O'Casey to drop. After this, [[Samuel Beckett]] withdrew his [[mime]] piece in protest.<ref name="Ayling 1982"/>

== Later life ==
[[File:Innisfallen Parade, Dublin.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Seán O'Casey home.|No. 9 Innisfallen Parade, Dublin. Seán O'Casey lived here from 1882 to 1888.]]
In 1959, O'Casey gave his blessing to a musical adaptation of ''Juno and the Paycock'' by American composer [[Marc Blitzstein]]. The musical, retitled ''[[Juno (musical)|Juno]]'', was a commercial failure, closing after only 16 [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] performances. It was also panned by some critics as being too "dark" to be an appropriate musical, a genre then almost invariably associated with light comedy. However, the music, which survives in a cast album made before the show opened, has since been regarded as some of Blitzstein's best work. Although endorsed by the then 79-year-old O'Casey, he did not contribute to the production or even see it during its brief run. Despite general agreement on the brilliance of the underlying material, the musical has defied all efforts to mount any successful [[revival (play)|revival]].

Also in 1959, [[George Devine]] produced ''[[Cock-a-Doodle Dandy]]'' at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] and it was also successful at the [[Edinburgh International Festival]] and had a West End run.

His eightieth birthday occurred in 1960, and to celebrate, David Krause and Robert Hogan wrote full-length studies. The [[Mermaid Theatre]] in London launched the "O'Casey Festival" in 1962, which in turn made more theatre establishments put on his works, mostly in Britain and Germany.<ref name="Ayling 1982"/> It is in the late years that O'Casey put his creative energy into his six-volume ''Autobiography.''

On 18 September 1964 at the age of 84, O'Casey died of a heart attack, in [[Torquay]], [[Devon]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0330.html Seán O'Casey, Irish Playwright, Is Dead at 84, New York Times]</ref> He was cremated at the [[Golders Green Crematorium]].

In 1965, his autobiography ''Mirror in My House'' (the umbrella title under which the six autobiographies he published from 1939 to 1956 were republished, in two large volumes, in 1956) was turned into a film based on his life called ''[[Young Cassidy]]''. The film was directed by [[Jack Cardiff]] (and [[John Ford]]) featuring [[Rod Taylor]] (as O'Casey), [[Flora Robson]], [[Maggie Smith]], [[Julie Christie]], [[Edith Evans]] and [[Michael Redgrave]].

== Personal life ==
O'Casey was married to Irish actress Eileen Carey Reynolds (1903–1995)<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-eileen-ocasey-1615166.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=John | last=Calder | title=OBITUARY: Eileen O'Casey | date=11 April 1995}}</ref> from 1927 to his death. The couple had three children: two sons, [[Breon O'Casey|Breon]] and Níall (who died in 1957 of [[leukaemia]]), and a daughter, Shivaun.<ref name="Ayling 1982"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://irishamerica.com/2010/10/a-lasting-legacy-sean-ocasey-and-the-abbey-theater/|title=A Lasting Legacy: Sean O'Casey and the Abbey Theater|first=Kara |last=Rota |date=October 2010}}</ref>

== Archival collection ==
In 2005, [[David H. Greene]] donated a collection of letters he received from O'Casey from 1944 to 1962 to the [[Fales Library]] at [[New York University]].  Also in the collection are two letters written by Eileen O'Casey and one letter addressed to Catherine Greene, David Greene's spouse.

O'Casey's papers are held in the [[New York Public Library]], the [[Cornell University Library]], the [[University of California, Los Angeles Library System]], the [[Senate House Library#Senate House Library|University of London Library]], the [[National Library of Ireland]], [[Colby College]], [[Boston College]] and the [[Fales Library]].
