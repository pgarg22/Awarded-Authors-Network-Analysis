'''Dorothy, Lady Dunnett''' {{post-nominals|OBE}} (née Halliday, 25 August 1923 &ndash; 9 November 2001) was a Scottish novelist best known for her [[historical fiction]]. Dunnett is most famous for her six novel series set during the 16th century, which concern the fictitious adventurer [[Francis Crawford of Lymond]]. This was followed by the eight novel prequel series ''[[The House of Niccolò]]''. Her other work include a novel concerning the historical [[Macbeth I of Scotland|Macbeth]] called ''King Hereafter'' (1982), and a series of mystery novels centered upon [[Johnson Johnson]], a portrait painter and spy.

==Life and work==
Dunnett was educated at [[James Gillespie's High School|James Gillespie's High School for Girls]] in [[Edinburgh]]. She started her career as a press officer in the civil service, where she met her husband.

A leading light in the Scottish arts world and a [[renaissance woman]], she was a professional portrait painter and exhibited at the [[Royal Scottish Academy]] on many occasions. She had portraits commissioned by a number of prominent public figures in Scotland. She had a keen interest in opera, was a trustee of the [[National Library of Scotland]], a board member of the [[Edinburgh International Book Festival]], a trustee of the [[Edinburgh castle#Scottish National War Memorial|Scottish National War Memorial]], and a [[non-executive director]] of Scottish Television. In 1992 she was awarded an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] for her services to literature. Writing in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', [[Alexander Fiske-Harrison]] reviewed her final novel in 2000, ''Gemini'', and through that her entire oeuvre of historical fiction: "Although Dunnett’s writing style is not the neutral prose of genre fiction and it can be opaque and hard to read, especially in the early works, at times, this works with the almost melodramatic content to produce a powerful, operatic mixture... It is neither as a literary novelist nor as a historian, but as a writer of historical fiction that Dorothy Dunnett deserves recognition... The publication of Gemini completes an ambitious literary circle."<ref>[[Alexander Fiske-Harrison|Fiske-Harrison, Alexander]] [https://fiskeharrison.wordpress.com/2014/11/28/the-tls-review-of-lymond/ 'Connected By Blood'], ''The Times Literary Supplement''. 11 August 2000</ref>

In 2001 she founded the [[Dorothy Dunnett Society]] to promote interest in the historical periods about which she wrote and communication between her readers.  Dorothy Dunnett's archive was left to the [[National Library of Scotland]] and articles from it appear in ''Whispering Gallery'', the magazine of the Dorothy Dunnett Society.

Dorothy Dunnett was married in 1946 to [[Alastair Dunnett|Sir Alastair Dunnett]], editor of ''[[The Scotsman]]'' newspaper, and appears in his autobiography, ''Among Friends'', 1984.  By virtue of his knighthood in 1995, she became Lady Dunnett.  She died in [[Edinburgh]], and was survived by her sons Ninian and Mungo Dunnett.

==Historical fiction==

===''Lymond Chronicles''===
The manuscript for the first book in the ''[[Lymond Chronicles]]'', ''The Game of Kings'', was rejected by five British publishers before being published by U.S. publisher [[G. P. Putnam's Sons|Putnam]] in 1961. It was written in response to her husband's suggestion that she write something herself, when she complained of having run out of reading material.

The ''Lymond Chronicles'' is a series of six novels, set in mid-sixteenth-century Europe and the Mediterranean, which follows the life and career of a Scottish nobleman, [[Francis Crawford of Lymond]], from 1547 through 1558. Meticulously researched, the series takes place in a wide variety of locations, including France, the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Malta]], England, Scotland and Russia.  In addition to a compelling cast of original characters, the novels feature many historical figures, often in important roles.

===''The House of Niccolò''===
''[[The House of Niccolò]]'' is a series of eight historical novels set in the late-fifteenth-century European Renaissance. The protagonist of the series is [[Nicholas de Fleury]] (Niccolò, Nicholas van der Poele, or Claes), a talented boy of uncertain birth who rises to the heights of European merchant banking and international political intrigue. The series shares most of the locations in Dunnett's earlier series, the ''[[Lymond Chronicles]]'', but it extends much further geographically to take in the important urban centres of [[Bruges]], [[Venice]], [[Florence]], [[Geneva]], and the [[Hanseatic League]]; [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], [[Flanders]], and Poland; [[Iceland]]; the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and [[Madeira]]; the Black Sea cities of [[Trabzon|Trebizond]] and [[Caffa]]; [[Persia]]; the Mediterranean islands of [[Cyprus]] and [[Rhodes]]; [[Egypt]] and the [[Sinai Peninsula]]; and [[West Africa]] and the city of [[Timbuktu]].  Nicholas's progress is intertwined with such historical characters as [[Anselm Adornes]], [[James III of Scotland]] and [[James II of Cyprus]].

As with the ''Lymond Chronicles'', the series features a number of historical persons, many as important characters. Both the historical and fictional characters are, however, taken from a wider variety of occupations and social classes than in the ''Lymond Chronicles''.  There are significant differences in narrative approach and writing style between the series, reflecting in part the very different personal journey taken by the central character in each.

===''King Hereafter''===
''[[King Hereafter]]'' (1982), her long novel set in Orkney and Scotland in the years just before the invasion of England by William the Conqueror, was in Dorothy Dunnett's eyes her masterpiece.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Books |url=http://dunnettcentral.org/dorothy/books |website=The Dorothy Dunnett Society |access-date=24 June 2018}}</ref>  It is about an Earl of Orkney uniting the people of Alba (Scotland) and becoming its king, and is based on the author's premise that the central character [[Thorfinn Sigurdsson, Earl of Orkney|Thorfinn, Earl of Orkney]] and the historical [[Macbeth of Scotland|Macbeth]], Scottish King, were one and the same person (Thorfinn is his birth name and Macbeth his baptismal name).

===''The Dorothy Dunnett Companion'' and ''Companion II''===
Dunnett assisted in the compilation of ''The Dorothy Dunnett Companion'' (1994) and ''The Dorothy Dunnett Companion II'' (2002), which were written by Elspeth Morrison. These books provide background information to historical characters and events featured in the ''Lymond Chronicles'' and ''The House of Niccolò'', as well as explanations of classical allusions and literary and other quotations used in the two series, notes to sources of these citations, and many maps. The second volume, which was written after the Niccolò series was completed,contains a bibliography of many of the hundreds of primary and secondary sources Dunnett used in her historical research. Dunnett contributed more to the second volume than the first and wrote many of the entries.

==The Johnson Johnson series==
{{main|Johnson Johnson}}
This series of mystery thrillers was written over a long period, starting when she was writing the Lymond Chronicles. The final entry was published prior to the first House of Niccolò book.

==Other works==
==="The Proving Climb"===
A contemporary short story, "The Proving Climb", set on the Scottish Isle of St. Kilda, was published in the 1973 anthology ''Scottish Short Stories'' (Scottish Arts Council, published by Collins, {{ISBN|0-00-221851-8}}).  It was republished by the Dorothy Dunnett Society and distributed to its members in 2008 with issue 100 of ''Whispering Gallery''.

===''The Lymond Poetry''===
''The Lymond Poetry'', contains her versions and translations of some of the poems that appeared in ''The Lymond Chronicles''.  This was finalised after her death by Elspeth Morrison and edited by Richenda Todd ({{ISBN|978-0141012445}} published in 2003 by Penguin).

===''The Scottish Highlands''===
In collaboration with her husband, Alastair Dunnett, she wrote the text for the photography book ''The Scottish Highlands'' (Photographs: David Patterson), published in 1988.

==Adaptations==
In December 2016, it was announced that the rights to the ''Lymond Chronicles'' had been obtained by [[Mammoth Screen]] with a view to making a TV series.<ref name="dowell">{{cite news |last1=Dowell |first1=Ben |title=Poldark producers line up new heroic historical drama The Lymond Chronicles |url=https://www.radiotimes.com/tv/drama/poldark-producers-line-up-new-heroic-historical-drama-the-lymond-chronicles/ |access-date=31 May 2021 |work=Radio Times |date=22 December 2016 |language=en}}</ref>

===Memorial===
On 22 April 2006, a memorial stone to Lady Dunnett was laid by her grandchildren, Hal and Bella Dunnett, alongside those for [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], [[Robert Burns]] and [[Sir Walter Scott]] in the [[Makars' Court]] in [[Lady Stair's Close]] on the [[Royal Mile]] in Edinburgh.  The Lord Provost of Edinburgh was in attendance, and gave a speech, as did the Edinburgh Makar ([[Valerie Gillies]]), and the [[Ross Herald]] (Charles Burnett).  The initiative to lay the stone, and the main funding for it, came from the members of the Dorothy Dunnett Society.  The Stone contains Dorothy Dunnett's name, her coat of arms, and a brief quote from one of her books "Where are the links of the chain ... joining us to the past".

===Edinburgh home===
Dunnett's long-term home at 87 Colinton Road, Edinburgh was at an [[Edwardian era]] semi-detached villa in the [[Merchiston]] area, designed by [[Edward Calvert (architect)|Edward Calvert]].
