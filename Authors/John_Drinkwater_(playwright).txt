'''John Drinkwater''' (1 June 1882 – 25 March 1937) was an [[England|English]] [[poet]] and [[dramatist]].

==Life and career==
Drinkwater was born in [[Leytonstone]], [[Essex]], (now [[Greater London]]), to actor/author Albert Edwin Drinkwater (1851–1923) and Annie Beck (''née'' Brown), and worked as an insurance clerk. In the period immediately before the [[World War I|First World War]] he was one of the [[Dymock poets|group of poets]] associated with the [[Gloucestershire]] village of [[Dymock]], along with [[Rupert Brooke]] and others. 

In 1918 he had his first major success with his play ''[[Abraham Lincoln (play)|Abraham Lincoln]]''. He followed it with others in a similar vein, including ''Mary Stuart'' and ''Oliver Cromwell''. In 1924, his Lincoln play was adapted for a two-reel [[short film]] made by [[Lee de Forest]] and [[J. Searle Dawley]] featuring [[Frank McGlynn Sr.]] as Lincoln, and made in de Forest's [[Phonofilm]] sound-on-film process.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/2064/Lee-de-Forest-and-Phonofilm-Virtual-Broadway.html |title=Lee de Forest and Phonofilm at Virtual Broadway website |access-date=27 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820125817/http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/2064/Lee-de-Forest-and-Phonofilm-Virtual-Broadway.html |archive-date=20 August 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

He had published poetry since ''The Death of Leander'' in 1906; the first volume of his ''Collected Poems'' was published in 1923. He also compiled anthologies and wrote literary criticism (e.g. ''Swinburne: an estimate'' (1913)), and later became manager of [[Birmingham Repertory Theatre]].

He was married to [[Daisy Kennedy]], the ex-wife of [[Benno Moiseiwitsch]], with whom he had a daughter named Penny. 

John Drinkwater made recordings in [[Columbia Records]]' International Educational Society Lecture series. They include Lecture 10 – a lecture on ''The Speaking of Verse'' (Four 78rpm sides, Cat no. D 40018-40019), and Lecture 70 ''John Drinkwater reading his own poems'' (Four 78rpm sides, Cat no. D 40140-40141).<ref>''Catalogue of Columbia Records, Up to and including Supplement no. 252'' (Columbia Graphophone Company, London September 1933), pp. 371, 374.</ref>
