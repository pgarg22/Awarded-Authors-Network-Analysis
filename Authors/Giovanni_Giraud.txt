Count '''Giovanni Giraud''' (1776–1834), [[Italy|Italian]] [[dramatist]], of French origin, was born at [[Rome]], and showed a precocious passion for the [[theatre]]. His first play, ''L'Honestà non si vince'', was successfully produced in 1798. He took part in [[politics]] as an active supporter of [[Pope Pius VI]], but was mainly occupied with the production of his plays. In 1809 he became director-general of the Italian theatres. Giraud's comedies, the best of which are ''Gelosie per equivoco'' (1807) and ''L'Ajo nell'imbarazzo'' (1824), were bright and amusing on the stage, but of no particular literary quality. His collected comedies were published in 1823 and his ''Teatro domestico'' in 1825. He died at Naples in 1834.
