'''Jonathan Coe''' {{post-nominals|list=[[FRSL]]}} ({{IPAc-en|k|oʊ}}; born 19 August 1961) is an English novelist and writer. His work has an underlying preoccupation with political issues, although this serious engagement is often expressed comically in the form of [[satire]]. For example, ''[[What a Carve Up! (novel)|What a Carve Up!]]'' (1994) reworks the plot of an old 1960s spoof horror [[What a Carve Up! (film)|film of the same name]].  It is set within the "carve up" of the UK's resources that was carried out by [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] governments of the 1980s.

==Early life and education==
Coe was born in [[Bromsgrove]], Worcestershire, on 19 August 1961 to Roger and Janet (née Kay) Coe.<ref name=Debretts2005>{{cite book|title=Debrett's People of Today 2005|edition=18th|isbn=1-870520-10-6|publisher=[[Debrett's]]|page=329}}</ref>  He studied at [[King Edward's School, Birmingham]], and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].<ref name=Debretts2005/>  He taught at the [[University of Warwick]], where he completed an MA and [[PhD]] in English Literature.<ref name=Debretts2005/>

==Career==
Coe has long been interested in both music and literature.  In the mid-1980s he played with a band (The Peer Group) and tried to get a recording of his music. He also wrote songs and played keyboards for a short-lived [[feminist]] cabaret group, Wanda and the Willy Warmers.<ref>{{cite news|last=Laity|first=Paul|title=Jonathan Coe: A Life in Writing|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/may/29/life-writing-jonathan-coe|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=29 May 2010}}</ref>

He published his first novel, ''The Accidental Woman'', in 1987. In 1994 his fourth novel ''[[What a Carve Up! (novel)|What a Carve Up!]]'' won the [[John Llewellyn Rhys Prize]], and the [[Prix du Meilleur Livre Étranger]] in France. It was followed by ''The House of Sleep'', which won the [[Writers' Guild of Great Britain]] Best Novel award and, in France, the [[Prix Médicis]]. As of 2020, Coe has published thirteen novels.

Besides novels, Coe has written a biography of the experimental British novelist [[B. S. Johnson]], ''Like a Fiery Elephant'', which won the [[Samuel Johnson Prize]] in 2005. Also in 2005 Penguin published his "collected shorter prose", a volume consisting of only 55 pages, under the title ''9th & 13th''. The same collection was published in France in 2012 under the title ''Désaccords imparfaits''.

He has written a short children's adaptation of ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' by [[Jonathan Swift]], and a children's story called ''The Broken Mirror''. Both titles are published in Italy only, as ''La storia di Gulliver'' (2011) and ''Lo specchio dei desideri'' (2012).

A handwritten manuscript page from ''[[The Rotters' Club (novel)|The Rotters' Club]]'' was displayed as part of the "Writing Britain: Wastelands to Wonderlands" exhibition that ran at the [[British Library]] during 2012.

Coe was a judge for the [[Man Booker Prize]] in 1996, and has been a jury member at the [[Venice Film Festival]] (in 1999, under the chairmanship of [[Emir Kusturica]]) and the [[Edinburgh Film Festival]] in 2007.

In 2012 Coe was invited by [[Javier Marías]] to become a duke of the kingdom of [[Redonda]]. He chose as his title "Duke of Prunes", after a favourite piece of music by [[Frank Zappa]].

Coe read an excerpt of ''[[The Terrible Privacy of Maxwell Sim]]'' to crowds at the [[Latitude Festival]] in July 2009. The central character was to be "a product of the social media boom", and "the sort of person with hundreds of Facebook friends but no one to talk to when his marriage breaks up."<ref>[https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2009-07/28/jonathan-coe-on-how-to-build-a-bettter-e-book.aspx?

Coe's 2019 book ''[[Middle England (novel)|Middle England]]'' won the [[European Book Prize]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20191209-talking-europe-jonathan-coe-european-book-prize-2019-winner-brexit-uk|title=British author Jonathan Coe, European Book Prize 2019 winner|website=France24|date=9 December 2019|access-date=28 November 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.euronews.com/2019/12/10/jonathan-coe-brexit-might-begin-a-conversation-britain-needs-to-have-with-itself|title=UK election: 'Getting Brexit done is going to take decades' says Jonathan Coe|first=Jez|last= Fielder|author2=Alasdair Sandford|author3=Isabel Silva|website=Euronews|date=23 December 2019|access-date=28 November 2021}}</ref> and also won the [[Costa Book Award]] in the Novel category.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/06/jonathan-coe-wins-costa-fiction-prize-for-perfect-brexit-novel|title=Jonathan Coe wins Costa prize for ‘perfect’ Brexit novel|newspaper=The Guardian|first=Alison|last=Flood|date=6 January 2020}}</ref>

==Film and TV adaptations==
Both ''What a Carve Up!'' (1994) and ''[[The Rotters' Club (novel)|The Rotters' Club]]'' (2001) have been adapted as drama serials for [[BBC Radio 4]]. ''What a Carve Up!'' was adapted by [[David Nobbs]].  ''The Rotters' Club'' was adapted for television by [[Dick Clement]] and [[Ian La Frenais]] and broadcast on [[BBC Two]] in January–February 2005. ''The Dwarves of Death'' (1990) was filmed as ''Five Seconds to Spare'' in 1999, for which Coe himself co-wrote the screenplay.

''[[The Very Private Life of Mister Sim]]'', a French film based on ''The Terrible Privacy of Maxwell Sim'', directed by [[Michel Leclerc]] and produced by Delante Cinema and Kare Productions, was released on 16 December 2015.

==Musical collaborations==

Music is a constant thread in Coe's work. He played music for years and tried to find a record label as a performer before becoming a published novelist. He had to wait until 2001 to make his first appearance on a record with ''9th & 13th'' (Tricatel, 2001), a collection of readings of his work, set to music by jazz pianist/double bass player Danny Manners and [[indiepop]] artist [[Louis Philippe (musician)|Louis Philippe]].

Coe is a lifelong fan of [[Canterbury sound|Canterbury]] [[progressive rock]]. His novel ''The Rotters' Club'' is named after an album by [[Hatfield and the North]]. He has contributed to the liner notes for that band's archival release ''Hatwise Choice''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hatfieldandthenorth.co.uk/|title=Hatfield and the North|website=www.hatfieldandthenorth.co.uk}}</ref> He once said: "I'd love to find a pianist to collaborate with – maybe Alex Maguire, who is now playing with the reformed line-up of Hatfield and the North". In fact this collaboration did come to fruition, at the [[Cheltenham Literature Festival]] in 2009, where Maguire performed a suite of piano pieces to accompany readings from the novel ''[[The Rain Before It Falls]]''. Coe has also performed live with [[flautist]] [[Theo Travis]].

Coe wrote the sleevenotes "Reflections on The High Llamas" for the 2003 compilation of [[The High Llamas]] ''Retrospective, Rarities and Instrumentals''. He has also written lyrics for songs on the albums ''My Favourite Part of You'' and ''The Wonder of It All'' by [[Louis Philippe (musician)|Louis Philippe]], and ''Earth to Ether'' by Theo Travis, for which the vocalist was [[Richard Sinclair]].

In 2008 Coe wrote ''Say Hi to the Rivers and the Mountains'', a 60-minute piece of what he calls "spoken musical theatre", with dialogue to be delivered continuously by three actors over a sequence of songs and instrumentals by The High Llamas. The work was premiered at the Analog Festival in Dublin that summer, and subsequently performed at various venues in the UK and Spain. The most recent performance was as part of the ''Notes and Letters'' Festival at [[Kings Place]] in London in September 2011, with [[Henry Goodman]] in the leading role of Bobby. The piece is inspired by the proposed demolition of [[Robin Hood Gardens]], an East London council estate designed by [[Alison and Peter Smithson]].

In March 2011, at the City Winery in New York, Coe took the keyboard solos on a live version of "Nigel Blows A Tune" from the [[Caravan (band)|Caravan]] album ''[[In the Land of Grey and Pink]]'', along with the musician/novelist [[Wesley Stace]] and his band The English UK.

==Personal life==
Coe married Janine McKeown in 1989, and they have two daughters born in 1997 and 2000.<ref name=Debretts2005/>

In 2009, Coe took part in [[Oxfam]]'s first annual book festival, "Bookfest". Along with [[William Sutcliffe]], Coe volunteered for the Oxfam Bloomsbury Bookshop in London on Thursday 9 July.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfam.org.uk/applications/blogs/books/?p=1664&|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608083239/http://www.oxfam.org.uk/applications/blogs/books/?p=1664&|url-status=dead|title=Oxfam books blog: Jonathan Coe and William Sutcliffe create window displays for the Oxfam Bloomsbury Bookshop|archive-date=8 June 2011}}</ref> Coe and Sutcliffe were each asked to choose a theme, and to find books from the stockroom to set up in the shop's window. Coe chose satire as the theme for his display. He chose books by or about [[Michael Moore]], [[Bill Hicks]], [[Peter Cook]] and [[Steve Bell (cartoonist)|Steve Bell]]. He also unearthed a script of [[Terry Gilliam]]’s film ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]''.

Coe donated a story to [[Oxfam]]'s "[[Ox-Tales]]" project, four collections of UK stories written by 38 authors. Coe's story was published in the ''Earth'' collection.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfam.org.uk/shop/content/books/books_oxtales.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718005818/http://www.oxfam.org.uk/shop/content/books/books_oxtales.html|url-status=dead|title=Oxfam: Ox-Tales|archive-date=18 July 2011}}</ref>

He is a trustee of the charity Cleared Ground Demining, and in spring 2007 visited [[Guinea-Bissau]] to write an article about their operations there.<ref>{{cite news|last=Coe|first=Jonathan|title=Deadly Legacy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/aug/18/voluntarysector?INTCMP=SRCH|newspaper=The Guardian|date=18 August 2007}}</ref>

In a 2001 newspaper interview, Coe described himself as an [[atheism|atheist]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Sally|last= Vincent|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/feb/24/fiction.jonathancoe1 |title=A Bit of a Rotter|newspaper=The Guardian|date=24 February 2001|page= 36}}</ref>
