==Life and career==
Born in [[Astoria, Queens|Astoria]], [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1963, he received a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in English from [[Cornell University]] (1985), an [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] in filmmaking from [[New York University]] (1991), an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in [[archaeology]] and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[psychology]] from Cornell (1996 and 2003). He has also worked as a [[film critic]], a hospital [[orderly]], a [[reporter|newspaper reporter]], a [[archivist|library archivist]], a college [[lecturer]] in [[anthropology]] and psychology, an animal behaviorist, and an advertising [[salesman]]. His Cornell dissertation research on how humans respond to the vocalizations of domestic cats got some attention from the news media, especially in publications aimed at "cat people".<ref>http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/May02/cat_talk.hrs.html   (Press Release)</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.catchannel.com/experts/article_14730.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-02-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720105408/http://www.catchannel.com/experts/article_14730.aspx |archive-date=2008-07-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2001913.stm|title = Evolution of supercats|date = 22 May 2002}}</ref>

Nicastro taught anthropology, psychology and writing at Cornell University and Hobart and William Smith Colleges. While active in research he published scholarly papers in ''Journal of Comparative Psychology'', ''Evolutionary Anthropology'', ''Behavioral & Brain Sciences'', and ''American Journal of Archaeology''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S9lQoMwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao|title=Nicholas Nicastro}}</ref> In 2005, he left academia to pursue writing full-time.

==Writings, reception, and awards==
Nicastro's writings include short fiction, travel and science articles in such publications as ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The New York Observer]]'', ''[[Film Comment]]'', and the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''. In 1996, he wrote and directed the documentary video ''Science or Sacrilege: Native Americans, Archaeology & the Law'', an examination of the conflict between scientists and native people for control of ancient remains.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.berkeleymedia.com/catalog/berkeleymedia/films/american_studies/science_or_sacrilege_native_americans_archaeology_and_the_law |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-12-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215172108/http://www.berkeleymedia.com/catalog/berkeleymedia/films/american_studies/science_or_sacrilege_native_americans_archaeology_and_the_law |archive-date=2010-12-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The video was honored by the American Anthropological Association, the Northwest Anthropological Conference, and the American Society for Ethnohistory, and is currently distributed by Berkeley Media LLC. It is often shown in college courses on this subject.{{Citation needed|date = January 2015|reason = Needs reliable, third-party sources to allow for verification - Not from Nicastro, Berkley Media, other partners or Press Releases - in order to keep this claim in the article.}}

From 2006 to 2015, Nicastro served as film critic for ''Tompkins Weekly'', a newspaper serving the greater Ithaca, NY area.<ref>http://www.tompkinsweekly.com</ref>

Nicastro's ancient fiction, including ''Empire of Ashes'' and ''The Isle of Stone'', is marked by a willingness to explore the dark underside of popular historical exploits. In ''Ashes'', he presents the career of [[Alexander the Great]] from the angle of a skeptical Athenian soldier/historian who must debunk Alexander's official divinity to save himself from a charge of [[sacrilege]]. Classicist and expert in Alexander studies Prof. Jeanne Reames (Martin Professor of History, University of Nebraska) praised the book for "avoiding both apologetics and exaggerated sensationalism, making ''Empire of Ashes'' one of the best recent novels on the conqueror.‚Äù<ref>Book Review: Empire of Ashes by Nicholas Nicastro," Amphora, American Philological Association, 6.1 (2007)</ref> ''Empire of Ashes'' was included in a list of all-time recommended historical novels by the Archaeological Institute of America.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.archaeological.org/pdfs/education/biblios/AIAhistoric_novels.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-02-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922120557/https://www.archaeological.org/pdfs/education/biblios/AIAhistoric_novels.pdf |archive-date=2015-09-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In ''Isle of Stone'', Nicastro presents a portrait of ancient [[Sparta]] during the [[Peloponnesian War]] that departs from what classical historian Paul Cartledge calls "the Spartan mirage". Instead, he reveals both the roots and the consequences of practices that, some say, made Sparta the Western world's prototype of a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian society]]. Cartledge himself has praised ''Isle of Stone'', observing "Nicastro's antiheroes of the isle of Sphacteria are the dark side of [Stephen] Pressfield's heroes in ''Gates of Fire'': both demand and repay the attention of all lovers of expert historical fiction." His demythologizing approach has not been popular with all readers, however, drawing its share of negative reviews.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.crescentblues.com/8_1issue/bk_nicastro_ashes.shtml|title = Crescent Blues Book Views &#124; Nicholas Nicastro: Empire of Ashes}}</ref>

Nicastro published his first book-length work of non-fiction in 2008. ''Circumference: Eratosthenes and the Ancient Quest to Measure the Globe'' tells the story of the first man to measure the size of the Earth accurately. In a review, the ''Bryn Mawr Classical Review'' observed some scholarly inaccuracies, but noted overall "Given the paucity of material in English on [[Eratosthenes]], anything is a welcome addition, but this book is ''much'' better than nothing. In its pages, historians of science will learn much about the ancient world, and historians of the ancient world will learn much about science."<ref>T. E. Rihll, ''Bryn Mawr Classical Review'' 2009.07.14

</ref> ''Circumference'' was subsequently cited as an "exemplar" text for 9th and 10th graders as part of the nationwide Common Core standards for English Language Arts.<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2012/12/05/list-what-common-core-authors-suggest-high-schoolers-should-read/</ref>

In 2010, Nicastro struck off in a new fictional direction with the publication of ''The Passion of the Ripper'', a psychological study of a prominent suspect in the Jack the Ripper murders of 1888. In its review, ''Ripperologist'' magazine, a leading publication in the study of the Ripper killings, called the novel "a strong new entry in the world of Ripper fiction".
