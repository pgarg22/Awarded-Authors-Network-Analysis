'''James Martin Fenton''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=80%|FRSL|FRSA}} (born 25 April 1949) is an English poet, journalist and literary critic.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3669373/James-Fenton-21st-century-renaissance-man.html |title=James Fenton: 21st century renaissance man |work=The Telegraph|date=2007-11-18 |access-date=2013-11-29 |location=London |first=David |last=Jenkins}}</ref> He is a former [[Oxford Professor of Poetry]].

==Life and career==
Born in [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]], Fenton grew up in [[Lincolnshire]] and [[Staffordshire]], the son of Canon [[John Fenton (priest)|John Fenton]], a [[Biblical criticism|biblical scholar]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/4177274/Canon-John-Fenton.html |title=Canon John Fenton |work=The Telegraph|date= 8 January 2009|access-date=2013-11-29 |location=London}}</ref> He was educated at the [[Durham Choristers School]], [[Repton School|Repton]] and [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]. He graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in 1970.<ref Name="CW">{{cite web |url=https://literature.britishcouncil.org/writer/james-fenton |title=Professor James Fenton |website=British Council Literature |publisher=[[British Council]] |access-date=2016-01-14}}</ref>

While at school Fenton acquired an enthusiasm for the work of [[W. H. Auden|W.H. Auden]]. At Oxford [[John Fuller (poet)|John Fuller]], who happened to be writing ''A Reader's Guide to W.H. Auden'' at the time, further encouraged that enthusiasm. Auden became perhaps the most significant single influence on Fenton's own work.

In his first year at university, Fenton won the [[Newdigate Prize]] for his [[sonnet]] sequence ''Our Western Furniture''.<ref Name="CW"/> Later published by Fuller's Sycamore Press, it largely concerns the cultural collision in the 19th century between the [[United States]] and [[Japan]]. It displays in embryo many of the characteristics that define Fenton's later work: technical mastery combined with a fascination with issues that arise from the Western interaction with other cultures. ''Our Western Furniture'' was followed by ''Exempla'', notable for its frequent use of unfamiliar words, as well as commonplace words employed in an unfamiliar manner.

Whilst studying at Oxford, Fenton became a close friend of [[Christopher Hitchens]], whose memoir ''[[Hitch-22]]'' is dedicated to Fenton and has a chapter on their friendship. Hitchens praised Fenton's extraordinary talent, stating that he too believed him to be the greatest poet of his generation. He also expounded on Fenton's modesty, describing him as infinitely more mature than himself and [[Martin Amis]]. Fenton and Hitchens shared a house together in their third year, and continued to be close friends until Hitchens's death. Fenton read his poem 'For Andrew Wood' at the ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' Hitchens memorial service.

His first collection, ''Terminal Moraine'' (1972) won a [[Eric Gregory Award|Gregory Award]].<ref Name="CW" /> With the proceeds he traveled to [[East Asia]], where he wrote of the U.S. withdrawal from [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], and the end of the [[Lon Nol]] regime in [[Cambodia]] which presaged the rise of [[Pol Pot]]. ''The Memory of War'' (1982) ensured his reputation as one of the greatest war poets of his time.<ref Name="CW"/>

Fenton returned to London in 1976. He was political correspondent of the ''[[New Statesman]]'', where he worked alongside Christopher Hitchens, [[Julian Barnes]] and Martin Amis.<ref Name="CW" /> He became the Assistant Literary Editor in 1971, and Editorial Assistant in 1972.<ref name=jf/> Earlier in his journalistic career, like Hitchens, he had written for ''[[Socialist Worker]]'', the weekly paper of the British [[trotskyist]] group then known as the [[Socialist Workers Party (Britain)|International Socialists]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Campion |first=Peter |url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poet.html?id=2157 |title=James Fenton |publisher=The Poetry Foundation |access-date=2013-11-29}}</ref> Fenton was an occasional [[war reporter]] in Vietnam during the late phase of the [[Vietnam War]] which ended in 1975. His experiences in Vietnam and Cambodia from summer 1973 form a part of ''All the Wrong Places'' (1988).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://asiabythebook.thingsasian.com/2008/06/16/all-the-wrong-places-adrift-in-the-politics-of-the-pacific-rim-by-james-fenton-atlantic-monthly-press/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004220633/http://asiabythebook.thingsasian.com/2008/06/16/all-the-wrong-places-adrift-in-the-politics-of-the-pacific-rim-by-james-fenton-atlantic-monthly-press/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-10-04 |title=All the Wrong Places: Adrift in the Politics of the Pacific Rim by James Fenton (Atlantic Monthly Press) « Asia by the Book |publisher=Asiabythebook.thingsasian.com |date=2008-06-16 |access-date=2013-11-29 }}</ref><ref>Barbara Korte Represented Reporters: Images of War Correspondents in Memoirs and ... 2009 - Page 17 "The poet James Fenton, for instance, was an occasional war reporter in Vietnam during the late phase of the war.

In 1983, Fenton accompanied his friend [[Redmond O'Hanlon]] to Borneo. A description of the voyage can be found in the book ''Into the Heart of Borneo''.

Fenton won the [[Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize]] in 1984 for ''Children in Exile: Poems 1968-1984''. He was appointed Oxford Professor of Poetry in 1994, a post he held till 1999.<ref name=jf/> He was awarded the [[Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry]] in 2007. The American composer [[Charles Wuorinen]] set several of his poems to music, and Fenton served as librettist for Wuorinen's opera ''[[Haroun and the Sea of Stories (opera)|Haroun and the Sea of Stories]]'' (2001, premiered in 2004), based on [[Salman Rushdie]]'s novel.

He has said, "The writing of a poem is like a child throwing stones into a mineshaft. You compose first, then you listen for the reverberation." In response to criticisms of his comparatively slim ''Selected Poems'' (2006), Fenton warned against the notion of poets churning out poetry in a regular, automated fashion.

Fenton has been a frequent contributor to ''[[The Guardian]]'',<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jamesfenton |title=James Fenton |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= 11 June 2008|access-date=2013-11-29 |location=London}}</ref> ''[[The Independent]]'' and ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.nybooks.com/contributors/james-fenton-2/|title=James Fenton|publisher=New York Review of Books }}</ref> He also writes the head column in the editorials of each Friday's ''[[Evening Standard]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-home/columnistarchive/James%20Fenton-columnist-1245-archive.do |title=James Fenton - London Evening Standard |publisher=Thisislondon.co.uk |access-date=29 November 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905054255/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-home/columnistarchive/James%20Fenton-columnist-1245-archive.do |archive-date= 5 September 2011 }}</ref> In 2007, he appeared in a list of the "100 most influential gay and lesbian people in Britain" published by ''[[The Independent|The Independent on Sunday]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article1153578.ece |title=Gay Power: The pink list - This Britain - UK - The Independent |publisher=News.independent.co.uk |date=2006-07-02 |access-date=2013-11-29 |location=London |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107115957/http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article1153578.ece |archive-date=7 January 2008 }}</ref>

Fenton's partner is [[Darryl Pinckney]], the prize-winning novelist, playwright and essayist perhaps best known for the novel ''High Cotton'' (1992).<ref>{{cite web|author=David Jenkins 12:17AM GMT 18 November 2007 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3669373/James-Fenton-21st-century-renaissance-man.html |title=James Fenton: 21st century renaissance man |work=The Telegraph|date=2007-11-18 |access-date=2016-12-09}}</ref>

In February 2019, ''The Guardian'' published an article<ref name="Yarwood">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/feb/01/i-couldnt-deal-with-it-it-tore-me-apart-surviving-child-sexual-abuse|title='I couldn't deal with it, it tore me apart': surviving child sexual abuse|last=Yarwood|first=Tom|date=2019-02-01|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-02-01|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> criticising Fenton for his earlier stance on the conductor [[Robert King (conductor)|Robert King]], who was convicted of sexually abusing five minors.<ref name="Fenton">{{cite web|last1=Fenton|first1=James|title=Facing the music|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jun/16/featuresreviews.guardianreview15|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=16 June 2007|access-date=31 August 2016}}</ref> The 2019 article was by one of the victims of King's repeated abuse; Fenton's earlier article concentrated entirely on the 'professional catastrophe' that King and to a lesser extent his record label would suffer, and made no mention of the harm to the boys, who were talented musicians being mentored by King.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Westphal|first1=Matthew|title=Conductor Robert King Convicted of Abusing Teenage Boys|date=4 June 2007|url=http://www.playbillarts.com/news/article/6591.html|publisher=Playbill Arts|access-date=21 February 2015}}</ref>

===Musical theatre influence===
Fenton has been influenced in his writing by musical theatre, as evidenced in 'Here Come the Drum Majorettes' from ''Out of Danger'':

<poem>"Gleb meet Glubb.
Glubb meet Glob.
God that's glum, that glib Glob dig.
'Dig that bog!'
'Frag that frog.'
Stap that chap, he snuck that cig.'"<ref>Quoted in Neil Corcoran ed., ''Do You, Mr Jones?'' (2002) p. 185–86</ref></poem>

He was the original English librettist for the musical of ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'' but [[Cameron Mackintosh]], finding his lyrics uninvolving, replaced him with [[Herbert Kretzmer]]; Kretzmer credited Fenton with creating the general structure of the adaptation.<ref name="Tims">{{cite web|last1=Tims|first1=Anna|title=How we made Les Misérables|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/feb/18/how-we-made-les-miserables|website=The Guardian|date=19 February 2013|access-date=13 June 2017}}</ref> He nonetheless received credit for "additional lyrics" and considerable royalties.<ref name="Poet who banks on Les Miserables">{{cite web|last1=Murphy|first1=Hayden|title=Poet who banks on Les Miserables|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12700449.Poet_who_banks_on_Les_Miserables/|website=The Herald|access-date=13 June 2017}}</ref>
