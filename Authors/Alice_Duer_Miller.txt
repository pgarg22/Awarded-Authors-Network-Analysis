==Career==
Miller became known as a campaigner for women's suffrage and published a series of satirical poems in the ''[[New York Tribune]]''. These were published subsequently as ''[[Are Women People]]?'' These words became a catchphrase of the suffrage movement.<ref name=TheConversation/><ref name=Iowa.gov/> It reads:

"FATHER, what is a Legislature?<br>
A representative body elected by the people of the state.<br>
Are women people?<br>
No, my son, criminals, lunatics and women are not people.<br>
Do legislators legislate for nothing?<br>
Oh, no; they are paid a salary.<br>
By whom?<br>
By the people.<br>
Are women people?<br>
Of course, my son, just as much as men are."<ref name=TheConversation/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chapman |first1=Mary |title="Are Women People?"

(1917).

As a novelist, she scored her first success with ''Come Out of the Kitchen'' in 1916.  The story was made into a play and later the 1948 film ''[[Spring in Park Lane]].'' She followed it with a series of other short novels, many of which were staged and (increasingly) made into films.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Morey |first1=Anne |title=A New Eroticism or Merely a New Woman?

Her novel in verse ''Forsaking All Others'' (1933) about a tragic love affair, and many consider her greatest work. Many of her stories were used for motion pictures, such as ''[[Are Parents People?]]'' (1925), ''[[Roberta (1935 film)|Roberta]]'' (1935), and ''[[Irene (1940 film)|Irene]]'' (1940), taking her to Hollywood.

==''The White Cliffs''==
In 1940, she wrote the verse novel ''The White Cliffs'', about an American girl who coming to London as a tourist, meets and marries a young upper-class Englishman in the period just before [[World War I]]. The war begins and he goes to the front. He is killed just before the end of the War, leaving her with a young son. Her son is the heir to the family estate. Despite the pull of her own country and the impoverished condition of the estate, she decides to stay and live the traditional life of a member of the English upper class. The story concludes as [[World War II]] commences, and she worries that her son, like his father, will be killed fighting for the country he loves. The poem ends with the lines:

:...I am American bred
:I have seen much to hate here – much to forgive,
:But in a world in which England is finished and dead,
:I do not wish to live.

The poem was spectacularly successful on both sides of the Atlantic, selling nearly one million copies – an unheard of number for a book of verse. It was broadcast and recorded by British-American actress [[Lynn Fontanne]] (with a symphonic accompaniment), and the story was made into the 1944 film ''[[The White Cliffs of Dover (1944 film)|The White Cliffs of Dover]]''.{{fact|date=September 2021}}

==Personal life==
Once she graduated, she married Henry Wise Miller on October 5, 1899, at Grace Church Chapel in New York City.<ref name=Burstyn /><ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1899/10/06/101134888.pdf Duer-Miller Wedding."] ''New York Times'', October 6, 1899.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gracechurchnyc.org/|title=Grace Church in New York &#124; Grace Church, an Episcopal Parish in the City of New York|accessdate=April 15, 2021}}</ref> He was a Harvard graduate,<ref name=AmericanWomenWriters/> born in 1877, the son of Lt.

They moved to [[Costa Rica]], where he attempted to develop [[Natural rubber|rubber cultivation]], which eventually failed. In 1903, she, Miller and their young son returned to New York.{{fact|date=September 2021}}

Her marriage lasted to the end of her life, but it was not tranquil.{{fact|date=September 2021}}
