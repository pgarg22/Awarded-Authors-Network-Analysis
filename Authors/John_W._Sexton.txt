== Life ==
Sexton was born of Irish parents in [[Newington Green]], London, in 1958. He moved to Ireland in 1982 and now resides in [[Kenmare]], [[County Kerry]].

He was born [[Catholic]] but has disowned that religion and describes himself as a [[pagan]]. He is inspired by what he calls a Muse Goddess, which is "the feminine and ancient energy that informs creation".<ref>[http://www.poetryireland.ie/writers/articles/poetry-beyond-faith-poetry-beyond-dogma Poetry Beyond Faith, Poetry Beyond Dogma]</ref>
