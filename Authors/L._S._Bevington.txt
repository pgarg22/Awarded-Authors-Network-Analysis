'''Louisa Sarah Bevington''' (born St John's Hill, [[Battersea]], [[Surrey]], now [[London Borough of Wandsworth]], 14 May 1845; died Lechmere Road, [[Willesden Green]], [[Middlesex]], now [[London Borough of Brent]], 28 November 1895) was an English [[Anarchism|anarchist]], essayist and poet. Among those who attended her funeral was [[Peter Kropotkin]].

==Early life and works==
Bevington was the oldest of eight children (seven daughters) born to the [[Quaker]] family of Alexander Bevington and his wife Louisa. Her father's occupation was given as "gentleman"; in 1861–1871 he was a member of [[Lloyd's]].<ref>'Bevington, Colin Corry', at http://www.bishopburton.org.uk/s1/attachments/article/410/CC%20Bevington.pdf.</ref> Details of her education are unknown, but the 1861 England census lists her among 30 scholars at a school run by a Miss Eliza Hovell at Marlborough House, Winchcombe Street, [[Cheltenham]], while her parents and siblings are said to reside at [[Walthamstow]], with four house servants and a coachman. She began to write poetry at an early age, probably appearing first with two sonnets in the ''Friends' Quarterly Examiner'' in October 1871.<ref name="Orlando">Orlando project biography.

Bevington's first collection, the 23-page ''Key Notes'', appeared in London in 1876 under the pseudonym Arbor Leigh.<ref>British Library Catalogue.

A further volume, ''Poems, Lyrics and Sonnets'' (1882) contained metrical experiments and remarks on the moribund state of Christianity.<ref name="Feminist">''The Feminist Companion to Literature in English'', eds Virginia Blain, Patricia Clements and Isobel Grundy (London: Batsford, 1990), p. 91.</ref>

One London weekly<ref>''The Spectator'', 18 October 1879.</ref> wrote admiringly of a poem in Bevington's 1879 ''Key-Notes'', describing it as "an exposition of the theory, physical and moral, of Evolution, which she entitles, 'Unto This Present'. If it were nothing else, it would be quite remarkable, as a literary tour de force, for the extraordinary ingenuity and success with which the writer has reduced to verse that never ceases to have a certain smoothness and even harmony, an argument bristling, so to speak, with philosophical terms. But it is more than this. It is a very eloquent and lucid philosophical statement, which, we take it, a scientific teacher would allow to give a clear and well-defined outline of the theory." Another reviewer, however, found that Bevington's style was one for which, "in the present condition of the English language, there is no vocabulary, but which exactly corresponds to the peculiar qualities known as 'goodiness,' 'cant,' and 'unctuosity,' when the writer or speaker happens to be content with the faith of his or her fathers. To us the style is equally offensive, whatever may be the opinions of the stylist, and we have rarely come across a more offensive example of it than these ''Key Notes''... [although] in the midst of this come a series of poems on the months, and a few miscellaneous songs which possess great simplicity, melody, and truth."<ref>''The Examiner'', 12 April 1879.</ref>

More widely read and appreciated were her prose arguments on similar subjects. In an article in ''[[The Nineteenth Century (periodical)|The Nineteenth Century]]'' in October 1879, entitled "Atheism and Morality", Bevington took a clear [[secularism|secularist]] position that provoked a clerical response. In December the same year, Bevington concluded a two-part essay entitled "Modern Atheism and Mr. Mallock". This reacted to an attack on atheism in the same paper by a young Oxford graduate, by putting forward a spirited defence of secular morality: "So far as human life is worth living, so far is it worth protecting. So far as it is not worth living, so far is it needful to ameliorate it. Duty, on secular principles, consists in the summarized conduct conducive to the ''permanent protection'' and ''progressive amelioration of'' the human lot.... Religion's foster-child, Society, must eventually learn to trust her own two feet of civil and moral law, and run alone."<ref>''The Nineteenth Century'', December 1879, pp. 1001 and 1015. Quoted in Barbara Gates: ''Victorian Suicide: Mad Crimes and Sad Histories'' (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1988), p. 153.

A further contribution to the debate was prompted by a letter to Bevington from the philosopher [[Herbert Spencer]], pointing out that rationalists showed greater humanity than adherents of organized religion.<ref>Letter of 18 May 1881, quoted in David Duncan: ''The Life and Letters of Herbert Spencer'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2014 [1908]), p. 216.

Retrieved 29 April 2015.]</ref> Her exposition of this appeared in ''[[The Fortnightly Review]]'' in August 1881, entitled "The Moral Colour of Rationalism". The discussion continued as an altercation between Spencer and the historian [[Goldwyn Smith]] in ''[[The Contemporary Review]]''.

In 1883 Bevington travelled to Germany, where on 2 May that year she married the artist Ignatz Guggenberger in Munich.<ref>'Marriages', ''Sussex Agricultural Express'', 8 May 1883.</ref> However, writing under her maiden name in 1888, she complained, "The minor and superficial domesticities of the hour are [the German woman's] only field of aspiration; ''klatsch'' [gossip] with her feminine acquaintances, or hanging out of window, are the most usual delights of her leisure hours; and even within the province assigned to her she habitually shrinks from the smallest mental departure on her own account.... [The] majority of German women are decidedly poor company, and the German home is humdrum and barren of all attraction for the other sex."<ref>L. S. Bevington, "Women in Germany", ''Woman's World'', August 1888, as quoted in the ''Dorking and Leatherhead Advertiser'', 11 August 1888.</ref> Her marriage lasted only until 1890, when she returned to London. There she began to move in anarchist circles and continued to use her maiden name.<ref name="libcom">"Bevington, Louisa Sarah, 1845–1895" [https://libcom.org/history/bevington-louisa-sarah-1845-1895.

Bevington" to "Miss Bevington", as she routinely objected to "Mrs" and "Miss", and suggested that her married name, Guggenberger, would have value only as an afterthought in a German publication. The letter was signed "L. S. Guggenberger".)<ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/title/ls-guggenberger-letter-to-dear-sir-1891-dec-25/oclc/53458462 Summary of a letter of 25 December 1891 to 'Dear Sir' in the Allison-Shelley manuscript collection of Pennsylvania State University Libraries.]</ref>

==Anarchist writings==
Bevington quickly came to know many London anarchists and gain a name as an anarchist poet. This was probably achieved through [[Charlotte Wilson]], who with [[Peter Kropotkin]] had founded the anarchist paper ''Freedom'' in 1886. However, Bevington rejected the tactics of bombs and dynamite and became associated with another paper, ''Liberty'', edited by the Scottish anarchist and tailor James Tochatti (1852–1928), for which she wrote numerous articles and poems. She also contributed to ''The Torch'', which was edited by [[Helen Rossetti Angeli|Helen]] and [[Olivia Rossetti Agresti|Olivia]] Rossetti, nieces of [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti|the painter]], and in an ''Anarchist Manifesto'' distributed in 1895 for the short-lived Anarchist Communist Alliance. She translated an essay on the [[Paris Commune]] by [[Louise Michel]], who became a friend.<ref name="libcom"/>

Shortly before her death from dropsy and mitral heart disease on 28 November 1895 at the age of fifty, Bevington wrote further articles for ''Liberty'' and published a final collection of poems,<ref name="libcom"/> of which some were later set to music.<ref>British Library Catalogue.
