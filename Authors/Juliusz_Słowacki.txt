'''Juliusz Słowacki''' ({{IPA-pol|ˈjuljuʂ swɔˈvat͡ski}}; {{lang-fr|Jules Slowacki}}; 4 September 1809 – 3 April 1849) was a Polish [[Romantic poet]]. He is considered one of the "[[Three Bards]]" of [[Polish literature]] — a major figure in the [[Romanticism in Poland|Polish Romantic period]], and the father of modern Polish drama. His works often feature elements of [[Slavic mythology|Slavic pagan traditions]], [[history of Poland|Polish history]], [[mysticism]] and [[orientalism]]. His style includes the employment of [[neologism]]s and [[irony]]. His primary genre was the drama, but he also wrote [[lyric poetry]]. His most popular works include the dramas ''[[Kordian]]'' and ''[[Balladyna (drama)|Balladyna]]'' and the poems ''[[Beniowski]]'', ''[[Testament mój]]'' and ''[[Anhelli]]''.

Słowacki spent his youth in the "[[Stolen Lands]]", in [[Kremenets]] ({{lang-pl|Krzemieniec}}; now in [[Ukraine]]) and [[Vilnius]] ({{lang-pl|Wilno}}, in [[Lithuania]]). He briefly worked for the government of the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]. During the [[November Uprising|November 1830 Uprising]], he was a courier for the [[Polish National Government (November Uprising)|Polish revolutionary government]]. When the uprising ended in defeat, he found himself abroad and thereafter, like [[Great Emigration|many compatriots]], lived the life of an émigré. He settled briefly in Paris, France, and later in Geneva, Switzerland. He also traveled through Italy, Greece and the Middle East. Eventually he returned to Paris, where he spent the last decade of his life. He briefly returned to Poland when [[Greater Poland Uprising (1848)|another uprising]] broke out during the [[Spring of Nations]] (1848).

===Emigration===

Like [[Great Emigration|many of his countrymen]], Słowacki decided to stay in France as a political refugee. In 1832 he published his first collections of poems and his first two dramas (''Mindowe'' and ''Maria Stuart'').<ref name=alma/><ref name=polona/> He also met Mickiewicz again; reportedly, Mickiewicz approached his younger colleague and shook his hand.<ref name=polona/> However, Słowacki's poems, written in the 1820s, were unpopular among his Polish compatriots, as they failed to capture the sentiment of a people living under [[partitions of Poland|foreign occupation]].<ref name=bioMK/> Słowacki was angered by Mickiewicz, who not only stole the limelight with his ''Księgi narodu polskiego i pielgrzymstwa polskiego'' (''Books of the Polish nation and pilgrimage''), but his part three of ''[[Dziady (poem)|Dziady]]'' (1832) cast Słowacki's stepfather, professor Bécu, in the role of a villain.<ref name=kow149>{{cite book|author=Alina Kowalczykowa|title=Juliusz Słowacki|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VbkXAQAAIAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Wydawn.

From 1833 to 1836, he lived in Switzerland.<ref name=polona/> A third volume of his poems, published in 1833 and containing works from the period of the Uprising, was far more nationalist in tone, and won more recognition in his homeland.<ref name=bioMK/> At the same time, he wrote several works featuring romantic themes, and beautiful scenery, such as ''W Szwajcarii'' (''In Switzerland''), ''Rozłączenie'' (''Separation''), ''Stokrótki'' (''Daisies'') and ''Chmury'' (''Clouds'').<ref name=polona/><ref name="WarnerRunkle1902"/><ref name=bioMK/><ref name=mikos/>

In 1834 he published the drama ''[[Kordian]]'', a romantic drama, illustrating the soul searching of the Polish people in the aftermath of the failed insurrection; this work is considered one of his best creations.<ref name=alma/><ref name="WarnerRunkle1902"/><ref name=bioMK/><ref name="Murray2004">{{cite book|author=Christopher John Murray|title=Encyclopedia of the romantic era, 1760–1850|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bXnMs-YDEF4C&pg=PA624|year=2004|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-57958-423-8|pages=1059–61}}</ref>

In 1840 Mickiewicz was elected to the position of professor of [[Slavic literature]] at [[Collége de France]]; it was one of the events that cemented his position over Słowacki in the Polish émigré community.<ref name=polona/> The rivalry between the two Bards for primacy would continue till the ends of lives.<ref name=polona/> In 1841 Słowacki traveled briefly to [[Frankfurt]], but Paris would become his main home till his death.<ref name=alma/> In 1840 and 1841 he wrote two notable dramas: ''Mazepa'', the only of his dramas that was put on stage during his lifetime, and ''Fantazy'', published posthumously, well received by critics.<ref name="Murray2004"/> Over the next few years Słowacki wrote and published many works, including ''[[Testament mój]]'' (''My Last Will''), in which he described his faith that his works would endure after his death.<ref name=polona/><ref name="Murray2004"/>

Between 1841 and 1846, he published ''Beniowski'', considered by some his best lyrical poetry.<ref name=bioMK/><ref name="Murray2004"/><ref name=mikos/> Starting as a story of a historical figure, it developed into a discussion of the poet's own life and opinions.<ref name=mikos/> In 1842 he joined the religious-philosophical group, ''Koło Sprawy Bożej'' (''Circle of God's Cause''), led by [[Andrzej Towiański]]. This group included, among others, Mickiewicz.<ref name=polona/> Towiański's influence is credited with a new, mystical current in Słowacki's works, seen in works such as the poem ''Beniowski'' and the drama ''Ksiądz Marek'' (''Father Mark'').<ref name=polona/> Słowacki left the Circle a year later, in 1843.<ref name=polona/>

In the summers of 1843 and 1844 Słowacki traveled to [[Pornic]], a resort on the Atlantic coast in [[Brittany]].<ref name=alma/><ref name=polona/> It was there, in 1844, that he wrote ''[[Genezis z Ducha]]'' (''Genesis from the Spirit'').<ref name=polona/> This work introduced his own philosophical system that would have a visible influence on his works in his last decade.<ref name=bioMK/><ref name=mikos/> Around 1839 Słowacki put his capital into the Parisian [[stock market]].<ref name=Rym-7-11>{{cite book|author=Jarosław Marek Rymkiewicz|title=Słowacki: encyklopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K6sXAQAAIAAJ|year=2004|publisher=Sic!|isbn=978-83-88807-58-9|pages=7–11|language=pl}}</ref> He was a shrewd investor who earned enough from the investments to dedicate his life to his literary career; he was also able to pay the costs of having his books published.<ref name=Rym-7-11/>

In the late 1840s Słowacki attached himself to a group of like-minded young exiles, determined to return to Poland and win its independence.<ref name=bioMK/> One of his friends was the pianist and composer [[Frédéric Chopin]].<ref>[http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=8.554529&catNum=554529&filetype=About%20this%20Recording&language=English Chopin: Complete Piano Music Vol. 3, Mazurkas Vol. 1]</ref> Others included enthusiasts of his work, such as [[Zygmunt Szczęsny Feliński]], [[Józef Alojzy Reitzenheim]] and [[Józef Komierowski]].<ref name=polona/> Despite poor health, when he heard about the events of the [[Spring of Nations]], Słowacki traveled with some friends to [[Poznań]], then under [[Prussian partition|Prussian control]], hoping to participate in the [[Greater Poland Uprising (1848)|Wielkopolska Uprising]] of 1848.<ref name=alma/><ref name=polona/> He addressed the [[Polish National Committee (1848)|National Committee]] (Komitet Narodowy) in Poznań on 27 April.<ref name=polona/> "I tell you", he declared as the rebels faced military confrontation with the Prussian Army, "that the new age has dawned, the age of holy [[Anarchism|anarchy]]." But by 9 May, the revolt was crushed.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Arrested by the Prussian police, Słowacki was sent back to Paris.<ref name=alma/> On his way there, he passed through [[Wrocław]], where in mid-June he was reunited with his mother, whom he had not seen for almost twenty years.<ref name=alma/> He returned to Paris in July 1848.<ref name=alma/> His poem ''[[Pośród niesnasków Pan Bóg uderza...]]'' (''Among the discord God hits...''), published in late 1848, gained new fame a century later when it seemed to foretell the 1978 ascent of Karol Wojtyła to the throne of St. Peter as [[Pope John Paul II]].<ref name=polona/><ref name=focushist/> His final dramas (''Zawisza Czarny'', ''Samuel Zborowski''), attempted to explain [[history of Poland]] through Słowacki's genesic philosophy.<ref name=bioMK/> In March 1849, Słowacki, his health failing, was visited three times by another Polish writer and poet, [[Cyprian Norwid]], who later wrote about his visits in ''Czarne kwiaty'' (''Black Flowers'').<ref name=polona/><ref name=bioMK/> Up to his final days, Słowacki was writing poetry; a day before his death he dictated passages of his final work, ''Król-Duch'' (''King-Spirit'').<ref name=polona/> This grandiose, visionary-symbolic poem, "summary of the entire Romantic culture", Słowacki's masterpiece, weaving together Poland's history and its contemporary political and literary thought, was never finished.<ref name=polona/><ref name=bioMK/>

Słowacki died in Paris on 3 April 1849 from [[tuberculosis]], and on 5 April he was buried in the [[Montmartre Cemetery]] in Paris.<ref name=alma/> He never married.<ref name=polona/> Only about 30 people attended his funeral.<ref name=alma/> Krasiński, although estranged from Słowacki in the last few years,<ref name=polona4/> wrote of the funeral:{{cquote|There were 30 compatriots at the funeral – nobody rose to speak, nobody uttered even one word to honour the memory of the greatest master of Polish rhymes<ref name=polona/>}}

Słowacki's tombstone at Montmartre was designed by his friend and executor of his [[last will]], painter Charles Pétiniaud-Dubos; it did not weather the passage of time well however, and in 1851 a new, similar tombstone was put in place, this one designed by Polish sculptor [[Władysław Oleszczyński]].<ref name=alma/> In 1927 Słowacki's remains were moved to [[Wawel Cathedral]] in Poland, but an empty grave still remains at Montmartre.<ref>Marek Troszyński, [http://archiwum.wiz.pl/1999/99113900.asp ŚLADAMI SŁOWACKIEGO], Wiedza i Życie, 1999. {{in lang|pl}}</ref>

Although the majority of his works were in Polish, he tried his hand at several works in French language (''Le roi de Landawa'', ''Beatrice Cenci'').<ref name=polona4/> Many of his works were published only [[List of works published posthumously|posthumously]], often under arbitrary titles, as Słowacki never named them himself.<ref name=polona2/> He also left notes on works that he never began or never completed.<ref name=polona2/><ref name="Hochman1984"/> Słowacki is also considered the father of modern Polish drama.<ref name="Hochman1984"/><ref>Julian Krzyżanowski (1972), ''Dzieje literatury polskiej'', PWN, p. 278. {{in lang|pl}}</ref>

Polish literary historian Włodzimierz Szturc divides Słowacki's work into four periods: Wolter's circle (pseudoclassicism), Christian ethic, Towiański's ethic and genesic ethic.<ref>Włodzimierz Szturc (1997), ''O obrotach sfer romantycznych.

Słowacki's works, situated in the period of [[romanticism in Poland]], contain rich and inventive vocabulary, including many [[neologism]]s.<ref name="WarnerRunkle1902"/><ref name="Hochman1984"/> They use [[fantasy]], [[mysticism]] and [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] and feature themes related to [[history of Poland|Poland's history]], essence of Polishness, and relation to a larger universe.<ref name="Hochman1984"/> Ławski, enumerating the main characteristics of Słowacki's writings, notes first that he was a "creationist", in the sense of creating new meanings and words (many of his characters bear names he invented himself, such as Kordian<ref name="SőtérNeupokoeva1977">{{cite book|author1=István Sőtér|author2=Irina Grigorʹevna Neupokoeva|title=European romanticism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6IlZAAAAMAAJ|year=1977|publisher=Akadémiai Kiadó : distributed by Kultura|isbn=978-963-05-1222-0|page=239}}</ref>).<ref name=polona2/> Second, he notes that Słowacki was not only inspired by works of others, from poets and writers to scholars and philosophers, but that his texts were often a masterful, ironic-grotesque [[polemic]] with other creators.<ref name=polona2/><ref name="King2007"/> For example, Słowacki was so impressed by [[Antoni Malczewski]]'s ''Maria'' that he wrote a sequel to it, ''Jan Bielecki''.<ref name=polona2/> Likewise, ''Kordian'' is seen as building on [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'',<ref name="King2007">{{cite book|author=Kimball King|title=Western Drama Through the Ages: A Student Reference Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F8s_VTNuqU4C&pg=PA216|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-32934-0|page=216}}</ref> and as Słowacki's response to Mickiewicz's ''[[Dziady (poem)|Dziady]]''.<ref name="Murray2004"/><ref name=gazeta>{{in lang|pl}} Agnieszka Szurek, [http://kordian.lektury.gazeta.pl/lektury/1,91399,5413645,Kordian.html Kordian], gazeta.pl, 1 July 2008</ref> This Ławski calls "ivy-like imagination", comparing Słowacki's approach to that of an [[ivy]], growing around works of others and reshaping them into new forms in a sophisticated literary game.<ref name=polona2/> Third, Słowacki was a master of [[irony]]; he used it not only on others, but on himself, and even on irony itself – the "irony of irony".<ref name=polona2/>

After his death, Słowacki acquired the reputation of a national prophet.<ref name=polona4/> He is now considered to be one of the "[[Three Bards]]" (''wieszczs'') of [[Polish literature]].<ref name=polona/><ref>{{in lang|pl}} [http://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/haslo.php?id=3996041 wieszcz], [[Internetowa encyklopedia PWN]]</ref>
Słowacki was not a very popular figure in Paris, nor among his contemporaries.<ref name=polona4>{{cite web|url=http://www.polona.pl/dlibra/collectiondescription2?dirids=8|title=Juliusz Słowacki: The man|author=Jarosław Ławski|year=2006|publisher=National Digital Library of Biblioteka Narodowa ([[Polish National Library]])|access-date=10 February 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628071854/http://www.polona.pl/dlibra/collectiondescription2?dirids=8|archive-date=28 June 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=bioMK/><ref name=polona3>{{cite web|url=http://www.polona.pl/dlibra/collectiondescription2?dirids=8|title=Juliusz Słowacki: Słowacki's Masks|author=Jarosław Ławski|year=2006|publisher=National Digital Library of Biblioteka Narodowa ([[Polish National Library]])|access-date=10 February 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628071854/http://www.polona.pl/dlibra/collectiondescription2?dirids=8|archive-date=28 June 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> He wrote many dramas, which can be seen as his favorite genre, yet he was a playwright who never saw any of his work performed on stage (only ''Mazepa'' was staged during his lifetime, and not in his presence).<ref name=polona4/><ref name="Murray2004"/> His works, written in Polish, dense with Slavic myths, philosophy and symbols, were difficult to translate to other languages.<ref name=polona4/><ref name=bioMK/> Słowacki's unpopularity among other Polish émigrés can be attributed to his unwillingness to pander to contemporary tastes; and in particular, his refusal to comfort his compatriots, shaken by the [[partitions of Poland|loss of Polish statehood]] and the failure of the [[November Uprising]]. Słowacki's ironic and sometimes pessimistic attitude was not appreciated by his contemporaries, nor was his denial of Polish uniqueness.<ref name=polona4/>

Whereas [[Mickiewicz]] followed the [[Christ of Europe|Messianic tradition]] and in ''[[Konrad Wallenrod|Konrad]]'' suggested that Poland's fate was in the hands of God, Słowacki's ''[[Kordian]]'' questioned whether his country was not instead a plaything of [[Satan]].<ref name=polona4/><ref name=mikos/><ref name=gazeta/> However, the same work has God and the Angels watching over Poland and the Earth. In ''[[Anhelli]]'', Słowacki's describes the tragic fate of [[sybirak|Polish exiles in Siberia]], painting a gloomy vision of Poland's destiny; the same topic was taken by Mickiewicz in the ''Books of the Polish Nation and of the Polish Pilgrimage'' as a call for Poles to spread hope and spirituality across Europe.<ref name=bioMK/><ref name=mikos>M.J. Mikos, [http://slowacki.chez.com/biomikos.htm JULIUSZ SLOWACKI (1809–1849)], 1999</ref> While a small circle of his friends talked about his wit, perseverance and inspiration, in popular memory he was a "sickly man of weak character", egocentric, bitter due to his failed rivalry with Mickiewicz. Mickiewicz himself wrote of Słowacki's work as a "beautiful church, but without God inside".<ref name=polona4/>

After his death, Słowacki gained a cult-like status in Poland; in particular, in the cultural center of [[Kraków]].<ref name=alma/> Several [[obituary|obituaries]] and longer articles appeared in the Polish press upon Słowacki's death.<ref name=alma/> His works, many of them published posthumously for the first time, found growing acceptance among a new generation; an 1868 work noted that "Słowacki took the fancy of the Polish youth. He was its singer, its spiritual leader in the full meaning of the term".<ref name=polona3/> Through undoubtedly a poet of the [[Romantic poetry|romantic era]], he was increasingly popular among the [[Positivism in Poland|positivists]] and the authors of the [[Young Poland]] period in the late 1800s and early 1900s.<ref name="Hochman1984"/><ref name=polona3/> His works were popularized by other writers, such as [[Adam Asnyk]] and [[Michał Bałucki]], and his dramas were shown in theaters.<ref name=alma/> He became a major literary figure for the new generation of Polish writers.<ref name=alma/> He also became respected abroad; a 1902 English language book edited by [[Charles Dudley Warner]] noted that "the splendid exuberance of his thought and fancy ranks him among the great poets of the nineteenth century".<ref name="WarnerRunkle1902"/>

In 1927, some eight years after Poland had regained independence, the Polish government arranged for Słowacki's remains to be transferred from Paris to [[Wawel Cathedral]], in [[Kraków]].<ref name=alma/><ref name=burial>{{in lang|pl}} Anna Agaciak, [http://www.polskatimes.pl/stronaglowna/244126,wielkie-spory-o-narodowy-panteon,id,t.html?cookie=1#material_2 "Wielkie spory o narodowy panteon"], ''Polska Times'', 13 April 2010.</ref> He was interred in the [[Crypt of the National Bards]], beside Mickiewicz.<ref name=burial/> Słowacki's interment at Waweł Cathedral was controversial, as many of his works were considered [[Heresy|heretic]]al by Polish Catholic-Church officials.<ref name=alma/><ref name=focushist/> It took almost two decades and the backing of [[Józef Piłsudski]], for whom Słowacki was a favorite poet, to obtain the Church's agreement to interring Słowacki at Wawel Cathedral.<ref name=alma/><ref name=focushist>{{in lang|pl}} ''[http://www.focus.pl/historia/artykuly/zobacz/publikacje/slowacki-heretyk-krolom-rowny/strona-publikacji/2/nc/1/ Słowacki.
