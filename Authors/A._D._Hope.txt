'''Alec Derwent Hope''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AC|OBE}} (21 July 1907{{snd}}13 July 2000) was an [[Australia]]n [[poet]] and [[essayist]] known for his [[satire|satirical]] slant. He was also a critic, teacher and academic.  He was referred to in an American journal as "the 20th century's greatest 18th-century poet".<ref name=gia/>

==Life==
Hope was born in [[Cooma]], [[New South Wales]].  His father was a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] minister and his mother a teacher.<ref name=gia>Gia Metherell, Obituary: "Poet, teacher and fearless civiliser". ''The Canberra Times'', 14 July 2000, p. 13</ref> He was educated partly at home and in [[Tasmania]], where they moved in 1911.  Three years later they moved to [[Sydney]].<ref name=gia/> He attended [[Fort Street High School]], the [[University of Sydney]] whilst residing at [[St Andrew's College, University of Sydney|St. Andrew's College]] and then the [[University of Oxford]] on a scholarship. Returning to Australia in 1931 he then trained as a teacher, and spent some time drifting. He worked as a [[psychologist]] with the New South Wales Department of Labour and Industry, and as a lecturer in Education and English at [[Sydney Teachers College|Sydney Teachers' College]] (1937–44).

He was a lecturer at the [[University of Melbourne]] from 1945 to 1950, and in 1951 became the first professor of English at the newly founded [[Canberra University College]], later of the [[Australian National University]] (ANU) when the two institutions merged.  At the ANU he and Tom Inglis Moore created the first full year course in Australian literature at an Australian university.<ref name=gia/> He retired from the ANU in 1968 and was appointed Emeritus Professor.<ref name = "MS 5836">{{cite web|title = MS 5836 Papers of A.D. Hope (1907-2000)|publisher= National Library of Australia |url= http://nla.gov.au/nla.ms-ms5836 |access-date= 13 July 2007}}</ref>

He was appointed an Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]] in 1972<ref name="itsanhonour">{{cite web |url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1107277&search_type=simple&showInd=true |title=It's an Honour - Honours - Search Australian Honours |publisher=itsanhonour.gov.au |access-date=8 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303213725/http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1107277&search_type=simple&showInd=true |archive-date=3 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and a Companion of the [[Order of Australia]] in 1981<ref name="itsanhonour2">{{cite web |url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=870165&search_type=advanced&showInd=true |title=It's an Honour - Honours - Search Australian Honours |publisher=itsanhonour.gov.au |access-date=8 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303182947/http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=870165&search_type=advanced&showInd=true |archive-date=3 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and awarded many other honours. He died in [[Canberra]], having suffered [[dementia]] in his last years, and is buried at the [[Queanbeyan]] Lawn Cemetery.

==Poet and critic==
Although he was published as a poet while still young, ''The Wandering Islands'' (1955) was his first collection and all that remained of his early work after most of his manuscripts were destroyed in a fire. Its publication was delayed by concern about the effects of Hope's highly-erotic and savagely-satirical verse on the Australian public. His frequent allusions to sexuality in his work caused [[Douglas Stewart (poet)|Douglas Stewart]] to dub him "Phallic Alec" in a letter to [[Norman Lindsay]].<ref>Geoffrey Dutton, "The final word" (written in 1991, before his death), ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 15 July 2000, p. 33</ref> His influences were [[Alexander Pope|Pope]] and the [[Augustan poetry|Augustan poets]], [[W. H. Auden|Auden]], and [[W. B. Yeats|Yeats]]. He was a polymath, very largely self-taught, and with a talent for offending his countrymen. He wrote a book of "answers" to other poems, including one in response to the poem "[[To His Coy Mistress]]" by [[Andrew Marvell]].

The reviews he wrote in the 1940s and '50s were feared "for their acidity and intelligence. If his reviews hurt some writers – [[Patrick White]] included – they also sharply raised the standard of literary discussion in Australia."<ref name = "KH2008">Hart (2008)</ref> However, Hope relaxed in later years. As poet [[Kevin Hart (poet)|Kevin Hart]] writes, "The man I knew, from 1973 to 2000, was invariably gracious and benevolent".<ref name = "KH2008"/>

Hope wrote in a letter to the poet and academic [[Catherine Cole]]: "Now I feel I've reached the pinnacle of achievement when you equate me with one of Yeats's 'wild, wicked old men'. I'm probably remarkably wicked but not very wild, I fear too much ingrained Presbyterian caution".<ref name = "KHCited">cited by Hart (2008)</ref> Cole suggests that Hope represented the three attributes that [[Vladimir Nabokov]] believed essential in a writer, "storyteller, teacher, enchanter".<ref name = "KHCited"/>

Hope's editor and fellow critic was David Brooks who was responsible for posthumously publishing the Selected Poetry and Prose of AD Hope in January, 2000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.readings.com.au/products/704527/a-d-hope-selected-poetry-and-prose|title=Not Found · Readings.com.au|website=www.readings.com.au}}</ref>

==Influence and impact==
Kevin Hart, reviewing Catherine Cole's memoir of Hope, writes that "When A. D. Hope died in 2000 at the age of 93, Australia lost its greatest living poet".<ref name = "KH2008"/> Hart goes on to say that when once asked what poets could do for Australia, Hope replied "oh not much, merely justify its existence".<ref name = "KHCited"/>

In 1998 a celebration of his life and works, ''The Scythe Honed Fine'', was published by the [[National Library of Australia]].

==Private life==
In 1937 he married Penelope Robinson.  They had a daughter, Emily, who predeceased her parents in 1979; and two sons, Andrew and Geoffrey, who survived him.  Penelope died in 1988.<ref name=gia/>
