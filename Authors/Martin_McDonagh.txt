==Career==
===Theatre===
Separated into two trilogies, McDonagh's first six plays are located in and around [[County Galway]], where he spent his holidays as a child. The first is set in [[Leenaun|Leenane]], a small village on the west coast of Ireland, and consists of ''[[The Beauty Queen of Leenane]]'' (1996), ''A Skull in Connemara'' (1997) and ''[[The Lonesome West]]'' (1997).<ref name=hick/> His second trilogy is set across the [[Aran Islands]], off the coast of County Galway, and consists of ''[[The Cripple of Inishmaan]]'' (1996), ''[[The Lieutenant of Inishmore]]'' (2001), and ''The Banshees of Inisheer''. The third play was never published, as McDonagh insisted it "isn't any good",<ref name=Mcd/><ref>[http://www.berkeleyrep.org/season/0607/pi_program.asp ''The Pillowman'' (2006–2007)] at [[Berkeley Repertory Theatre]].

===Film===
McDonagh has stated that he prefers writing films to plays, as he holds a "respect for the whole history of films and a slight disrespect for theatre." In a 1998 conversation with Irish drama critic [[Fintan O'Toole]] in ''[[BOMB (magazine)|BOMB]]'' magazine, McDonagh further explained, 
<blockquote>It's not that I don't respect theatre. I'm intelligent enough to know that a play can completely inspire a person as much as a film...[but] theatre isn't something that's connected to me, from a personal point of view, I can't appreciate what I'm doing.<ref>{{cite web|title=Martin McDonagh|url=http://bombsite.com/issues/63/articles/2146|work=BOMB Magazine|publisher=New Art Publications|access-date=14 April 2013|author=Fintan O'Toole|date=Spring 1998}}</ref></blockquote>In an interview in 2005, the ''New York Times'' writer observed that McDonagh "now seems more comfortably resigned to the storytelling powers of drama, if still dismissive of its inherent elitism. 'It's kind of weird working in an art form that's not, well ...,' he stops and starts again. 'It's strange to be working in an art form that costs $100 to participate in.'"<ref>McKinley, Jesse.
