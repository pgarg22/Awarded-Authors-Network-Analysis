'''Julian Tuwim''' (13 September 1894 – 27 December 1953), known also under the pseudonym "Oldlen" as a lyricist,<ref name="youtube">{{YouTube|-DYhkmCHY_A|Biographical notes at his song ''Co nam zostało z tych lat''}}</ref> was a [[Polish poet]], born in [[Łódź]], then part of the [[Russian Partition]]. He was educated in Łódź and in [[Warsaw]] where he studied [[law]] and [[philosophy]] at [[Warsaw University]]. After Poland's [[Second Polish Republic|return to independence]] in 1918, Tuwim co-founded the [[Skamander]] group of experimental poets with [[Antoni Słonimski]] and [[Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz]]. He was a major figure in [[Polish literature]], admired also for his contribution to [[children's literature]]. He was a recipient of the prestigious Golden Laurel of the [[Polish Academy of Literature]] in 1935.<ref name="Qlturka">[http://www.qlturka.pl/profil_autora_ilustratora,71,Julian_Tuwim.html  Julian Tuwim (1894-1953)], {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426050823/http://www.qlturka.pl/profil_autora_ilustratora%2C71%2CJulian_Tuwim.html |date=2012-04-26 }} ''Qlturka.pl.''

==Life and work==
Tuwim was born into a family of assimilated [[Polish Jews|Jews]]. The [[surname]] comes from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''tovim'' ({{Script/Hebrew|טובים}}) meaning "good ones". His parents, Izydor and Adela, provided Julian with a comfortable middle class upbringing. He was not a particularly diligent student and had to repeat the sixth grade. In 1905 the family had to flee from Łódź to [[Wrocław]] (Breslau) in order to escape possible repercussions following Izydor's involvement in the [[Revolution of 1905]].

Initially Tuwim's poetry, even more than that of the other Skamandrites, represented a decisive break with turn-of-the-20th-century mannerism. It was characterized by an expression of vitality, optimism, in praise of urban life. His poems celebrated everyday life in the city, with its triviality and vulgarity. Tuwim often used vernacular language in his work, along with slang as well as poetic dialogue.

[[File:Witkacy Julian Tuwim.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Portrait of Tuwim by [[Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz|Witkacy]].]]

His collections ''Czyhanie na Boga'' ("In Lurking for God"; 1918), ''Sokrates tańczący'' ("Dancing Socrates"; 1920), ''Siódma jesień'' ("Seventh Autumn"; 1922), and ''Wierszy tom czwarty'' ("Poems, Volume Four"; 1923) are typical of his early work. In his later collections – ''Słowa we krwi'' ("Words in the Blood"; 1926), ''Rzecz Czarnoleska'' ("The [[Czarnolas, Zwoleń County|Czarnolas]] Matter"; 1929), ''Biblia cygańska'' ("The Gypsy Bible"; 1933) and ''Treść gorejąca'' ("A Burning Matter"; 1933) – Tuwim became restless and bitter, and wrote with fervour and vehemence about the emptiness of urban existence. He also drew more heavily from the [[romantism|romantic]] and [[classicism|classicist]] traditions, while perfecting his form and style, and becoming a [[virtuoso]] wordsmith.

From the very beginning and throughout his artistic career, Tuwim was [[satire|satirically]] inclined. He supplied sketches and monologues to numerous [[cabaret]]s. In his poetry and articles, he derided [[obscurantism]] and [[bureaucracy]] as well as [[militarism|militaristic]] and [[nationalism|nationalistic]] trends in politics. His [[burlesque]] ''Bal w Operze'' ("The Ball at the Opera"; 1936) is regarded as his best satirical poem.

In 1918 Tuwim co-founded the [[cabaret]] (comedy troupe) named Picador and worked as a writer or artistic director with many other comedy troupes, such as Czarny Kot (1917–1919), Quid pro Quo (1919–1932), Banda, Stara Banda (1932–1935), and finally Cyrulik Warszawski (1935–1939). Since 1924, Tuwim was a staff writer at ''Wiadomości Literackie'' where he wrote a weekly column titled ''Camera Obscura''. He also wrote for the satirical magazine ''[[Szpilki]]''.

Tuwim displayed his caustic sense of humour and unyielding individuality in works such as "Poem in which the author politely but firmly implores the vast hosts of his brethren to kiss his arse." Here, Tuwim systematically enumerates and caricatures various personalities of the European social scene of the mid-1930s -- 'perfumed café intellectuals', 'drab socialists', 'fascist jocks', 'Zionist doctors', 'repressed Catholics' and so on, and ends every stanza by asking each to perform the action indicated in the title. The poem ends with a note to the would-be censor who would surely be tempted to expunge all mention of this piece for its breach of 'public standards.'

His poem [[Do prostego człowieka|''Do prostego człowieka'']] (''To the Common Man''), first published on 7 October 1929 in ''[[Robotnik (1894–1939)|Robotnik]]'', provoked a storm of attacks on Tuwim both from left-wing circles, which criticized the poem's "burgeouis expression of pacifist sentiment", and from [[right wing|right-wing]] groups which accused Tuwim of calling for the disarmament of the young state.<ref name="Shore">{{in lang|en}} {{Cite book| author =Marci Shore | title =Caviar and ashes: a Warsaw generation's life and death in Marxism, 1918-1968 | year =2006 | pages =74–75 | publisher =[[Yale University Press]] | location =New Haven, Conn. | isbn=978-0-300-11092-0 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=0nyESYH8ZnEC&q=%22simple+man%22+Tuwim&pg=PA73 | access-date =2009-10-19 }}</ref>

Julian's aunt was married to [[Adam Czerniaków]], and his uncle from his mother's side was [[Arthur Rubinstein]].

==World War II and after==
In 1939, at the beginning of World War II and the German occupation of Poland, Tuwim emigrated through [[Romania]] first to France, and after France's capitulation, to [[Brazil]], by way of Portugal, and finally to the US, where he settled in 1942. In 1939–1941, he collaborated with the émigré weekly "Wiadomości Polskie", but broke off the collaboration due to differences in views on the attitude towards the Soviet Union. In 1942–1946, he worked with the monthly "Nowa Polska" published in London, and with leftist Polish-American newspapers. He was affiliated with the Polish section of the International Workers Organization from 1942. He was also a member of the Association of Writers From Poland (a member of the board in 1943).

During this time he wrote "Kwiaty Polskie" (''Polish Flowers''), an epic poem in which he remembers with nostalgia his early childhood in Łódź. In April 1944 he published a manifesto, entitled "My, Żydzi Polscy" (''We, Polish Jews'').

Tuwim returned to Poland after the war in 1946 but did not produce much in [[Stalinist Poland]]. He died in 1953 at the age of 59 in [[Zakopane]]. Although Tuwim was well known for serious poetry, he also wrote satirical works and children poems, for example ''Lokomotywa'' (''The Locomotive''; 1938, tr. 1940), translated into many languages.<ref>[http://www.europeanmama.com/locomotive-poem/ "Locomotive" poem], French. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220164743/http://www.europeanmama.com/locomotive-poem/ |date=2016-12-20 }}</ref> He also wrote well-regarded [[translation]]s of [[Pushkin]] and other [[Russian language|Russian]] poets.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Russian Soviet poet [[Yelizaveta Tarakhovskaya]] translated most of Tuwim's children's poetry into Russian.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}
