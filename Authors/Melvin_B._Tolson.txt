'''Melvin Beaunorus Tolson''' (February 6, 1898 – August 29, 1966) was an American poet, educator, columnist, and politician.  As a poet, he was influenced both by Modernism and the language and experiences of [[African American]]s, and he was deeply influenced by his study of the [[Harlem Renaissance]].<ref>Gold, David. (2008). ''Rhetoric at the Margins''. Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press. pp. 49-59.</ref>

As a debate coach at the historically black [[Wiley College]] in [[Marshall, Texas]], Tolson led a team that pioneered interracial college debates against white colleges in the segregated South.<ref name="Gold, 43-49">Gold, 43-49.</ref> This work was depicted in 2007 biopic ''[[The Great Debaters]]'', produced by [[Oprah Winfrey]] and starring [[Denzel Washington]] as Tolson.<ref name="Gold, 43-49" /><ref>Beil, Gail.

== Early life and education ==
Born in [[Moberly, Missouri]], Tolson was one of four children of Reverend Alonzo Tolson, a [[Methodist]] minister, and Lera (Hurt) Tolson, a seamstress of African-[[Creek people|Creek]] ancestry.<ref name="media.www.lugazette.com">[http://media.www.lugazette.com/media/storage/paper816/news/2008/02/06/Opinion/The-Great.Debater.Melvin.B.Tolson-3188961.shtml Dr. Eric Anthony Joseph, "The Great Debater, Melvin B.

Reverend Tolson studied throughout his life to add to the limited education he had first received, even taking [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Hebrew]] by correspondence courses.<ref name="media.www.lugazette.com" /> Both parents emphasized education for their children.

Melvin Tolson graduated from Lincoln High School in Kansas City in 1919.  He enrolled at [[Fisk University]] but transferred to [[Lincoln University, Pennsylvania]] the next year for financial reasons.  Tolson graduated with honors in 1923.  He became a member of the [[Omega Psi Phi]] fraternity.

== Marriage and family ==
In 1922, Melvin Tolson married Ruth Southall of [[Charlottesville, Virginia]], whom he had met as a student at Lincoln University.  Their first child was Melvin Beaunorus Tolson, Jr., who, as an adult, became a professor at the [[University of Oklahoma]].<ref>[http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/poets/s_z/tolson/libretto.htm Melvin B.

== Career ==
After graduation, Tolson and his wife moved to [[Marshall, Texas]], where he taught [[Communication studies|speech]] and English at [[Wiley College]] (1924–1947).  The small, [[historically black college|historically black]] Methodist Episcopal college had a high reputation among blacks in [[Southern United States|the South]] and Tolson became one of its stars.<ref>Melvin B. Tolson, Jr., [https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst;jsessionid=JnsGDf2p41HtQD5SNCpcshK1BpQz56K5sTBhnm0gnnWngSrFJfcb!-1064738139?docId=95710646 "The Poetry of Melvin B. Tolson (1898–1966)"], ''World Literature Today'', Vol. 64, 1990; accessed January 13, 2009.</ref>

In 1930–31 Tolson took a leave of absence from teaching to study for a [[Master's degree]] at [[Columbia University]].  His thesis project, "The Harlem Group of Negro Writers," was based on his extensive interviews with members of the [[Harlem Renaissance]].<ref name="media.www.lugazette.com" /><ref name="Melvin B. Tolson">[http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/poets/s_z/tolson/bio.htm "Melvin B. Tolson"], ''Modern American Poetry'', University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign; accessed January 13, 2009</ref>  His poetry was strongly influenced by his time in New York.  He completed his work and was awarded the master's degree in 1940.

In addition to teaching English, Tolson used his high energies in several directions at Wiley.  He built an award-winning [[debate]] team, the Wiley Forensic Society, which became a pioneer in interracial collegiate debates. Beginning in 1930, the team debated against law students from the University of Michigan in Chicago; then, in 1931, it participated in the first known interracial collegiate debate in the South, against Oklahoma City University. During their tour in 1935, they competed against the [[University of Southern California]], which they defeated.<ref name="media.www.lugazette.com" /><ref>[http://www.marshallnewsmessenger.com/news/content/news/opinion/120907_WEB_latham.html "Invisibility was the worst result of Jim Crow's South"]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211004539/http://www.marshallnewsmessenger.com/news/content/news/opinion/120907_WEB_latham.html |date=December 11, 2007 }}</ref>  There he also co-founded the black intercollegiate Southern Association of Dramatic and Speech Arts, and directed the theater club. In addition, he coached the junior varsity football team.<ref name="media.www.lugazette.com" />

Tolson mentored students such as [[James Farmer]] and [[Sweatt v. Painter|Heman Sweatt]], who later became civil rights activists.  He encouraged his students not only to be well-rounded people but also to stand up for their rights. This was a controversial position in the segregated [[U.S. Southern states|U.S. South]] of the early and mid-20th century.

In 1947 Tolson began teaching at [[Langston University]], a [[historically black college]] in [[Langston, Oklahoma]], where he worked for the next 17 years.  He was a dramatist and director of the [[Dust Bowl]] Theater at the university.  One of his students at Langston was [[Nathan Hare]], the black studies pioneer who became the founding publisher of the journal ''The Black Scholar''.

In 1947 [[Liberia]] appointed Tolson its Poet Laureate.  In 1953 he completed a major epic poem in honor of the nation's centennial, the ''Libretto for the Republic of Liberia''.

Tolson entered local politics and served three terms as [[mayor]] of [[Langston, Oklahoma]] from 1954 to 1960.<ref>Melvin B. Tolson biography, [http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/poets/s_z/tolson/bio.htm "Melvin B. Tolson 1898–1966: Plain Talk and Poetic Prophesy"], ''Modern American Poetry'', University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; accessed January 13, 2009.</ref>

In 1947, Tolson was accused of having been active in organizing farm laborers and tenant farmers during the late 1930s (though the nature of his activities is unclear) and of having radical leftist associations.<ref>[http://www.marshallnewsmessenger.com/featr/content/features/entertainment/tolson_bio.html Marshall News Messenger].</ref>

Tolson was a man of impressive intellect who created poetry that was "funny, witty, humoristic, slapstick, rude, cruel, bitter, and hilarious," as reviewer [[Karl Shapiro]] described the ''Harlem Gallery''.<ref>Introduction, ''The Harlem Gallery'', New York: Twayne Publishers, 1965.</ref>  The poet [[Langston Hughes]] described him as "no highbrow. Students revere him and love him. Kids from the cotton fields like him. Cow punchers understand him ... He's a great talker."{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

In 1965, Tolson was appointed to a two-year term at [[Tuskegee Institute]], where he was Avalon Poet. He died after [[cancer]] surgery in [[Dallas, Texas]], on August 29, 1966. He was buried in [[Guthrie, Oklahoma]].

== Literary works ==
From 1930 on, Tolson began writing poetry. He also wrote two plays by 1937, although he did not continue to work in this genre.<ref name="media.www.lugazette.com" />

From October 1937 to June 1944, Tolson wrote a column for ''[[The Washington Tribune]],'' which he called "Cabbage and Caviar".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cabbage and Caviar: Selected Columns from the Washington Tribune, 1937–1944|last=Farnsworth|first=Robert M., ed.|publisher=U of Missouri P|year=1982|location=Columbia|pages=vi}}</ref>

In 1941, he published his poem "Dark Symphony" in the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]''. Some critics believe it is his greatest work, in which he compared and contrasted African-American and [[European-American]] history.

In 1944 Tolson published his first poetry collection, ''Rendezvous with America'', which includes ''Dark Symphony''.  He was especially interested in historic events which had fallen into obscurity.<ref name="Melvin B. Tolson" />

Tolson's ''Libretto for the Republic of Liberia'' (1953), another major work, is in the form of an [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] in an eight-part, ''rhapsodic'' sequence.  It is considered a major modernist work.<ref name="Melvin B. Tolson" />

Tolson's final work to appear in his lifetime, the long poem ''Harlem Gallery'', was published in 1965.  The poem consists of several sections, each beginning with a letter of the [[Greek alphabet]].  The poem concentrates on African-American life.  It was a striking change from his first works, and was composed in a jazz style with quick changes and intellectually dense, rich allusions.<ref name="Melvin B. Tolson" />

In 1979 a collection of Tolson's poetry was published posthumously, entitled ''A Gallery of Harlem Portraits''.  These were poems written during his year in New York.  They represented a mixture of various styles, including short narratives in free verse.  This collection was influenced by the loose form of [[Edgar Lee Masters]]' ''Spoon River Anthology''.<ref name="Melvin B. Tolson" />  An urban, racially diverse and culturally rich community is presented in ''A Gallery of Harlem Portraits''.

With increasing interest in Tolson and his literary period, in 1999 the [[University of Virginia]] published a collection of his poetry entitled ''Harlem Gallery and Other Poems of Melvin B. Tolson'', edited by Raymond Nelson.

Tolson's papers are housed at the [[Library of Congress]].
