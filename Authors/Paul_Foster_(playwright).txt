== Early life ==

Foster studied journalism at [[Rutgers University–New Brunswick|Rutgers University]] then moved to Manhattan at the age of 21 to study law at [[New York University School of Law]]. After serving in the [[United States Navy|Navy]] for two years, Foster developed an interest in theatre. While living in New York, he met [[Ellen Stewart]], a fashion designer planning to open her own boutique. In 1962, Foster agreed to help Stewart with her boutique in exchange for using the basement space as a theater in the evenings. "...Stewart's enthusiasm for the theater project quickly eclipsed her own initial idea for the boutique", and La MaMa was born.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4_9ZxU0p7yYC&pg=PA88|title=Playing Underground: A Critical History of the 1960 Off-Off-Broadway Movement|last=Bottoms|first=Stephen James|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=2004|isbn=0-472-11400-X|location=Ann Arbor|page=88|access-date=March 3, 2012}}</ref> The theater moved around Manhattan's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] multiple times before settling into its current space at 74A East Fourth Street in 1969.
