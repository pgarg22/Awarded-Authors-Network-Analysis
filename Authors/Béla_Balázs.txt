'''Béla Balázs''' ({{IPA-hu|ˈbeːlɒ ˈbɒlaːʒ|lang}}; 4 August 1884 in [[Szeged]] – 17 May 1949 in [[Budapest]]), born '''Herbert Béla Bauer''', was a Hungarian [[film criticism|film critic]], [[aesthetics|aesthetician]], writer and poet of [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Jewish]] heritage. He was a proponent of [[formalist film theory]].

==Career==
Balázs was the son of Simon Bauer and Eugénia Léwy, adopting his ''nom de plume'' in newspaper articles written before his 1902 move to Budapest, where he studied Hungarian and German at the Eötvös Collegium.

Balázs was a moving force in the [[Sonntagskreis]] or Sunday Circle, the intellectual discussion group which he founded in the autumn of 1915 together with Lajos Fülep, [[Arnold Hauser]], [[György Lukács]] and [[Karl Mannheim|Károly (Karl) Mannheim]]. Meetings were held at his flat on Sunday afternoons; already in December 1915 Balázs wrote in his diary of the success of the group.<ref name=gluck>Mary Gluck (1985) [https://books.google.com/books?id=TUdmFkDoIGUC&pg=PA15 ''Georg Lukács and His Generation, 1900–1918'']. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0674348664}}. pp. 14–16</ref>

He is perhaps best remembered as the librettist of ''[[Bluebeard's Castle]]'' which he originally wrote for his roommate [[Zoltán Kodály]], who in turn introduced him to the eventual composer of the opera, [[Béla Bartók]]. This collaboration continued with the scenario for the ballet ''[[The Wooden Prince]]''.

The collapse of the short-lived [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] under [[Béla Kun]] in 1919 began a long period of exile in Vienna and Germany and, from 1933 until 1945, the Soviet Union.  In 1922, Balázs published ''Mantel der Träume'' (translated and published in English as ''The Cloak of Dreams: Chinese Fairy Tales'' in 2010).  The book, lauded by [[Thomas Mann]] as a "beautiful book," is a collection of strange, sometimes chilling, fairy tales.

In Vienna he became a prolific writer of film reviews. His first book on film, ''Der sichtbare Mensch'' (''The Visible Man'') (1924), helped found the German "film as a language" theory, which also exerted an influence on [[Sergei Eisenstein]] and [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]]. A popular consultant, he wrote the screenplay for [[G. W. Pabst]]'s film of ''[[The Threepenny Opera (1931 film)|Die Dreigroschenoper]]'' (1931), which became the object of a scandal and lawsuit by [[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]] (who admitted to not reading the script) during production.

Later, he co-wrote (with [[Carl Mayer]]) and helped [[Leni Riefenstahl]] direct the film ''[[Das blaue Licht]]'' (1932).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140222011309/http://www.walter-riml.at/walter-riml.at/-_1931_The_blue_light_-.html 1931 „the blue light“]. walter-riml.at</ref> Riefenstahl later removed Balázs's and Mayer's names from the credits because they were [[Jewish]].<ref>[http://www.uni-konstanz.de/FuF/Philo/LitWiss/MedienWiss/Forsch/Telaviv/Riefenstahl-englisch.html Hanno Loewy: "Balazs' and Leni Riefenstahl's The blue Light.

Uni-konstanz.de. Retrieved on 24 May 2015.</ref> One of his best known films is ''[[Somewhere in Europe (film)|Somewhere in Europe]]'' (''It Happened in Europe'', 1947), directed by [[Géza von Radványi]].

His last years were marked by petty vexations at home and ever increasing recognition in the German-speaking world. In 1949, he received the most distinguished prize in [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]], the [[Kossuth Prize]]. Also in 1949, he finished ''Theory of the Film'', published posthumously in English (London: Denis Dobson, 1952). In 1958, the Béla Balázs Prize was founded and named for him as an award to recognize achievements in  [[cinematography]].
