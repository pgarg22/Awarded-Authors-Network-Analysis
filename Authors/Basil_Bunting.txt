==Life and career==
Born into a [[Quaker]] family in [[Benwell and Scotswood]], [[Newcastle-on-Tyne]], Northumberland, he studied at two Quaker schools: from 1912 to 1916 at [[Ackworth School]] in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]] and from 1916 to 1918 at [[Leighton Park School]] in Berkshire.<ref name="Literary Encyclopedia Bunting">{{cite web

}}</ref> His Quaker education strongly influenced his pacifist opposition to the [[First World War]], and in 1918 he was arrested as a [[conscientious objector]] having been refused recognition by the tribunals and refusing to comply with a notice of call-up. Handed over to the military, he was court-martialled for refusing to obey orders, and served a sentence of more than a year in [[Wormwood Scrubs (HM Prison)|Wormwood Scrubs]] and [[HMP Winchester|Winchester prison]]s.<ref name="Centre for Northern Studies Bunting">{{cite web

}}</ref> Bunting's friend [[Louis Zukofsky]] described him as a "conservative/anti-fascist/imperialist",<ref>James J. Wilhelmm, E''zra Pound: the tragic years, 1925–1972'', Penn State Press, 1994, p. 128.</ref> though Bunting himself listed the major influences on his artistic and personal outlook somewhat differently as "Jails and the sea, Quaker mysticism and socialist politics, a lasting unlucky passion, the slums of Lambeth and Hoxton ..."<ref name="See Bunting to Eric Mottram, quoted in">{{cite journal|last=Bill Griffiths|journal=Chicago Review|year=1998|volume=44}}</ref> 
 
These events were to have an important role in his first major poem, "Villon" (1925). "Villon" was one of a rather rare set of complex structured poems that Bunting labelled "sonatas", thus underlining the sonic qualities of his verse and recalling his love of music. Other "sonatas" include "Attis: or, Something Missing", "Aus Dem Zweiten Reich",  "The Well of Lycopolis",  "The Spoils" and, finally, "Briggflatts". After his release from prison in 1919, traumatised by the time spent there, Bunting went to London, where he enrolled in the [[London School of Economics]], and had his first contacts with journalists, social activists and Bohemia. Bunting was introduced to the works of [[Ezra Pound]] by [[Nina Hamnett]] who lent him a copy of ''Homage to Sextus Propertius''.<ref>Peter Makin, "Bunting: the Shaping of his Verse" (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1992).</ref> The glamour of the cosmopolitan modernist examples of Nina Hamnett and [[Mina Loy]] seems to have influenced Bunting in his later move from London to Paris.

After travelling in Northern Europe, Bunting left the London School of Economics without a degree and went to France. There, in 1923, he became friendly with [[Ezra Pound]], who years later would dedicate his ''Guide to Kulchur'' (1938) to both Bunting and [[Louis Zukofsky]], "strugglers in the desert". Between February and October 1927, Bunting wrote articles and reviews for ''[[The Outlook (British magazine)|The Outlook]]'', and then became its music critic until the magazine ceased publication in 1928.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Strong Song Tows Us: The Life of Basil Bunting, Britain's Greatest Modernist Poet |first=Richard |last=Burton |publisher=Infinite Ideas |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-909-65248-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rScRAgAAQBAJ |page=133}}</ref> Bunting's poetry began to show the influence of the friendship with Pound, whom he visited in [[Rapallo]], Italy, and later settled there with his family from 1931 to 1933. He was published in the [[Objectivist poets|Objectivist]] issue of ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'' magazine, in the ''Objectivist Anthology'', and in Pound's ''Active Anthology''.{{fact|date=January 2021}}

In the 1930s, Bunting became interested in medieval Persian literature, studied to the language to some degree, and began publishing adaptations of Persian poems by [[Ferdowsi]], [[Manuchehri]], [[Saadi Shirazi|Sa’di]], [[Hafez]], and [[Obayd Zakani]]; their use of sound patterning seems to have influenced his own.<ref>Simon Patton and Omid Azadibougar, 'Basil Bunting’s Versions of Manuchehri Damghani', ''Translation and Literature'', 25 (2016), 339–62 (esp. pp. 341, 361-62); {{DOI|10.3366/tal.2016.0262}}.</ref> During the [[Second World War]], Bunting served in British Military Intelligence in [[Iran|Persia]]. After the war, in 1948, he left government service to become the correspondent for ''The Times of London'', in Iran. He married a [[Kurds|Kurdish]] woman – Sima Alladadian who was thirty years his junior. Because of his marriage to the underage girl, Bunting was fired from the British embassy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Loloi|first=Parvin|date=2009|title=BUNTING, Basil Cheesman|url=https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/bunting-basil-cheesman|journal=[[Iranica Online]]}}</ref> 

Back in Newcastle, he worked as a journalist on the ''Evening Chronicle'' until his rediscovery during the 1960s by young poets, notably [[Tom Pickard]] and [[Jonathan Williams (poet)|Jonathan Williams]], who were interested in working in the [[modernist]] tradition. In 1965, he published his major long poem, ''[[Briggflatts]]'', named after the village in [[Cumbria]] where he is now buried in the Quaker graveyard.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Birch|first1=Dana|title=Oxford Companion to English Literature|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780191735066|edition=7th|doi=10.1093/acref/9780192806871.001.0001}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Basil Bunting|url=https://www.poetsgraves.co.uk/bunting.htm|website=Poets' Graves|access-date=18 January 2017}}</ref>

In later life he published ''Advice to Young Poets'', beginning "I SUGGEST / 1. Compose aloud; poetry is a sound."<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Bunting died in 1985 in [[Hexham]], Northumberland.<ref name="durham"/>

===Briggflatts===
{{main|Briggflatts}}
Divided into five parts and noted for its intricate use of sound and resonances with medieval literature,<ref>Helen Price, '[http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/6607/ Human and NonHuman in Anglo-Saxon and British Postwar Poetry: Reshaping Literary Ecology]' (unpublished doctoral thesis, University of Leeds, 2013), pp. 179-94.</ref> ''Briggflatts'' is an autobiographical long poem, looking back on teenage love and on Bunting's involvement in the high modernist period. In addition, ''Briggflatts'' can be read as a meditation on the limits of life and a celebration of [[Northumberland|Northumbrian]] culture and dialect, as symbolised by events and figures like the doomed Viking King [[Eric Bloodaxe]]. The critic [[Cyril Connolly]] was among the first to recognise the poem's value, describing it as "the finest long poem to have been published in England since [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[Four Quartets]]''".

===Portrait bust of Basil Bunting===

Basil Bunting sat in Northumberland for sculptor [[Alan Thornhill]], with a resulting terracotta<ref>[http://alanthornhill.co.uk/sm_005.htm Portrait head of Basil Bunting in clay for bronze] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719115538/http://alanthornhill.co.uk/sm_005.htm |date=19 July 2008 }}, image of sculpture by Alan Thornhill, who travelled to Northumberland for Bunting's sitting.</ref> (for bronze) in existence. The correspondence file relating to the Bunting portrait bust is held as part of the Thornhill Papers (2006:56) in the archive<ref>[http://www.henry-moore-fdn.co.uk/matrix_engine/content.php?page_id=584 HMI Archive.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112193428/http://www.henry-moore-fdn.co.uk/matrix_engine/content.php?page_id=584 |date=12 January 2009 }}</ref> of the [[Henry Moore Foundation]]'s Henry Moore Institute in Leeds and the terracotta remains in the collection of the artist.

==In popular culture==
[[Mark Knopfler]] wrote a song, titled 'Basil', about his time as a Saturday afternoon [[copy boy]] on the Newcastle ''[[Evening Chronicle]]'' when Bunting worked there. The song was recorded for Knopfler's 2015 album ''[[Tracker (album)|Tracker]]''.
