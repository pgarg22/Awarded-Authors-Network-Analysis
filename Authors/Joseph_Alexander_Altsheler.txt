'''Joseph Alexander Altsheler''' (April 29, 1862 – June 5, 1919) was an American newspaper reporter, editor and author of popular juvenile [[historical fiction]]. He was a prolific writer, and produced fifty novels and at least fifty-three short stories. Thirty-two of his novels were part of his seven series:
*''The Civil War Series'' (8 volumes)
*''The French and Indian War Series'' (6 volumes)
*''The Gold Series'' (2 volumes)
*''The Great West Series'' (2 volumes)
*''The Texan Series'' (3 volumes)
*''The World War Series'' (3 volumes)
*''The Young Trailers Series'' (8 volumes)

==Early life and education==
Altsheler was born in Three Springs, [[Hart County, Kentucky]], to Joseph and Louise (née Snoddy) Altsheler. He attended Liberty College in [[Glasgow, Kentucky]], before entering [[Vanderbilt University]].

==Career==
In 1885, he took a job at the ''[[Louisville Courier-Journal]]'' as a reporter and later worked as an editor.  He started working for the  ''[[New York World]]'' in 1892, first as the paper's Hawaiian correspondent and then as the editor of the ''World'''s tri-weekly magazine.  Due to a lack of suitable stories, he began writing children's stories for the magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fal51|website=The Handbook of Texas|title=ALTSHELER, JOSEPH ALEXANDER|accessdate=14 August 2015|date=2010-06-09}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Altsheler married Sarah Boles on May 30, 1888; they had one son, Sidney.

Altsheler and his family were in Germany in 1914 when [[World War I]] began, and they were forced to remain in Germany for a time. The hardships the Altshelers endured in returning to the U.S. damaged Altsheler's health and rendered him a semi-invalid until his death.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fal51|website=The Handbook of Texas|title=ALTSHELER, JOSEPH ALEXANDER|accessdate=14 August 2015|date=2010-06-09}}</ref> Upon returning to the U.S., he wrote [[Joseph A. Altsheler#The World War Series|The World War Series]] of books based on his ordeal.

==Death==
Altsheler died in New York City on June 5, 1919, aged 57; his obituary appeared in ''The Evening World'', on June 6, 1919. His widow, Sarah, died 30 years later. Both are buried at the [[Cave Hill Cemetery]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].

==Bibliography==
Although each of the thirty-two novels constitutes an independent story, Altsheler suggested a reading order for each series (i.e., he numbered the volumes). The remaining eighteen novels can be read in any order. [Note, however, that ''A Knight of Philadelphia'' was later expanded through the addition of nineteen chapters and some minor tweaks to become Mr. Altsheler's novel ''In Hostile Red.'']

His short stories are not ordered, however, readers may prefer to read them in the order in which they were published. The short story list below is displayed in chronological order with the publication dates shown alongside the titles.

All of the titles below are available in digital format for viewing and downloading from many websites. Some websites allow free access to all 100 titles.
