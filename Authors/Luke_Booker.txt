 |quote = "... that at a time when a gloomy spirit is pervading the country, not only diminishing the stock of harmless enjoyments, but endangering a morbid taste detrimental also to elegant literature, a drama might be constructed, though not professedly of a sacred character, against which fanaticism itself should have no just cause to allege any objection." (Booker's explanation for publishing his 1831 play, ''The Champion of Cyrus, a drama, in five acts''.)
