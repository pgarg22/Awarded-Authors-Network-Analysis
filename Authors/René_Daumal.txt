He is best known in the English-speaking world for two novels: ''[[A Night of Serious Drinking]]'', and the [[allegorical]] novel ''[[Mount Analogue|Mount Analogue: A Novel of Symbolically Authentic Non-Euclidean Adventures in Mountain Climbing]]'', both based upon his friendship with Alexander de Salzmann, a pupil of [[G. I. Gurdjieff]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}}

Daumal was [[autodidacticism|self-taught]] in the [[Sanskrit]] language and translated some of the [[Tripitaka]] [[Buddhist]] canon into the French language, as well as translating the literature of the Japanese [[Zen]] scholar [[D.T. Suzuki]] into French.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}}

He married the Bulgarian émigré Vera Milanova, the former wife of the poet Hendrik Kramer; after Daumal's death, she married the landscape architect [[Russell Page]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}}

==Death==
Daumal's sudden and premature death from [[tuberculosis]] on 21 May 1944 in [[Paris]] may have been hastened by youthful experiments with drugs and psychoactive chemicals, including [[carbon tetrachloride]]. He died leaving his novel ''Mount Analogue'' unfinished, having worked on it until the day of his death.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}}

He is buried at [[Cimetière parisien de Pantin]] in [[Pantin]], a municipality just outside Paris.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}}

==Legacy==
The motion picture [[The Holy Mountain (1973 film)|''The Holy Mountain'']] by [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]] is based largely on Daumal's ''Mount Analogue''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}}
