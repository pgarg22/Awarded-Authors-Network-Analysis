'''Robert Sward''' (born 1933) is an American and Canadian poet and novelist. [[Jack Foley (poet)|Jack Foley]], in his Introduction to Sward's ''Collected Poems, 1957–2004'' (Black Moss Press, 2004) calls him, "in truth, a citizen, at heart, of both countries. At once a Canadian and American poet, one with a foot in both worlds, Sward also inhabits an enormous in-between." Or, as Rainer Maria Rilke puts it, "Every artist is born in an alien country; he has a homeland nowhere but within his own borders."

==Early years==

Born in 1933 and raised in Chicago, Illinois, Sward began writing poetry at the age of 15 when he became involved with a street gang and used rhyming couplets in his notes to the other gang members. He graduated from [[Von Steuben High School]] at 17 and quit his job as a [[soda jerk]] in a pharmacy to join the [[United States Navy]]. In 1952 he was stationed in [[Korea]] on an amphibious ship, LST 914. A [[Yeoman]] 3rd Class, Sward soon became the head of the ship's library, while serving in the combat zone during the [[Korean War]].

==University==
He has taught at [[Cornell University]], 1964–65, where he first experimented with computer-generated poetry and served on the editorial board of ''[[Epoch (American magazine)|Epoch]]''. He went on to teach at the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]], the [[University of Victoria]], and the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]].

==Working in media==
In the 1980s he worked for the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]], where he interviewed and produced 60-minute radio features on [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Margaret Atwood]], [[Earle Birney]], [[John Robert Colombo]], [[Al Purdy]], [[Gwendolyn MacEwen]], and other leading Canadian figures.  His ''[[Quill & Quire]]'' interview with Nobel prize winner, [[Saul Bellow]], was widely read. Sward also worked as journalist, book reviewer and feature writer for ''[[The Toronto Star]]'', ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', and ''[[The Financial Times]]'' in [[Toronto]], Ontario while living on the [[Toronto Islands]]. He received a [[Canada Council]] grant to research and write ''The Toronto Islands'' (1983), a best-selling (Source: Dreadnaught Press publisher, 1983) illustrated history of a unique community, from prehistoric times to the present.

==Awards==
A [[Fulbright Scholar]] and [[Guggenheim Fellow]], he was chosen by Lucille Clifton to receive a Villa Montalvo Literary Arts Award and is the author of 30 books of poetry, fiction and nonfiction. He has been published widely in numerous anthologies and traditional literary magazines, such as ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[Poetry Chicago]]'', and ''[[The Hudson Review]]''. Sward later worked as technical writer and editor for Santa Cruz Operation (SCO), and served as "bridge person" between traditional hard copy academic periodicals and literary eZines.

In September 2016, at Second Annual Voices of the River Poetry Celebration, supported by a grant from Arts Council Santa Cruz County, sponsored by Bookshop Santa Cruz, Poetry Santa Cruz and the Coastal Watershed Council, Robert Sward was named Poet Laureate of Santa Cruz County, 2016–2018.

The preceding Poets Laureate included Gary Young, David Swanger and Ellen Bass<ref>[http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/article/NE/20160805/FEATURES/160809741 ]{{dead link|date=April 2020}}</ref>

==Internet publishing==
He began publishing on the Internet in the late 1980s and early 90s with appearances in ''Alsop Review'', ''Blue Moon Review'', ''Web de Sol'', ''X-Connect'', ''eSCENE'', ''Fiction Online'', ''Hawk'', ''Realpoetik'', and ''Zero City''. His essay, "Why I Publish in e-Zines", appeared online in 1995 and has been widely reprinted. Sward's "Earthquake Collage," impressions, news items, poetry, and facts regarding the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and its aftermath, appeared in "Pathways to the Past, Adventures in Santa Cruz County History, History Journal Number 6," Museum of Art and History, Santa Cruz, CA, April 2009.

Sward's first book, ''Uncle Dog & Other Poems'' (1962), was published by Putnam & Co. in England. It was followed by ''Kissing the Dancer'' (Cornell University Press, 1964), with an Introduction by Pulitzer Prize poet [[William Morris Meredith, Jr.|William Meredith]]. ''The Carleton Miscellany'' reviewed the book saying, "In the animal poems there is a bravery in the face of our limitations, a warmth for our absurdities, a way of life to be gleaned from our failings and ineptitudes... a self-critique that turns our freakishness into an ironic source of fulfillment and transcendence." Source: Theodore Holmes in "The Carleton Miscellany" 1964. The poem, "Uncle Dog: The Poet At 9", has been frequently anthologized and Sward continues to write about exotic animals and dogs in particular. Animated videos of these works (mini-movies with poetry) employ avatars, digital representations of the poet and his subjects, and appear in DVD format and online at Blue's Cruzio Cafe.

A key theme in his most recent books, ''Rosicrucian in the Basement'' (2001), ''Heavenly Sex'' (2002), ''The Collected Poems, 1957–2004'' (2004), and ''God is in the Cracks'' (2006), is fathers and sons. Sward's father, Dr. Irving M. Sward, was a podiatrist and something of a mystic, combining his practice of Rosicrucianism with a study of the Kabbalah. Of ''Rosicrucian in the Basement'', [[Robert Bly]] writes, 'There are many mysteries between father and son that people don't talk about... There's much leaping [in Sward's poetry], but each line, so to speak, steps on something solid.'  In commenting on the father and son series [[Dana Gioia]] adds, "The CD is terrific... ''Rosicrucian in the Basement'' unfolds perfectly at its own pace and never loses the listener."

[[Garrison Keillor]] selected ''God is in the Cracks'', one of the father and son poems and title poem of Sward's 2006 collection, for broadcast on his radio show "Writer's Almanac."<ref>[http://writersalmanac.publicradio.org/index.php?date=2003/03/22]{{dead link|date=April 2020}}</ref><ref>[http://jjwebb.ihwy.com/rosycrossfather/godisinthecracks_keillor.mp3]{{dead link|date=April 2020}}</ref>
