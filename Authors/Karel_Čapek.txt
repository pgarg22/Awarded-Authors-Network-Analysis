=== Early life and education ===
Karel Čapek was born in 1890 in the village of [[Malé Svatoňovice]] in the [[Bohemia]]n mountains. However, six months after his birth, the Čapek family moved to their own house in [[Úpice]].{{sfn|Ort|2013|p= 17}} Karel Čapek's father, Antonín Čapek, worked as a doctor at the local textile factory.<ref name="oregon">{{cite web|url= http://journalism.uoregon.edu/~russial/cyberj/prism/people/jagernauth/capekwork.html |title= Life of Karel Čapek |publisher= Prism: UO Stories, University of Oregon |access-date= 20 July 2016}}</ref> Antonín was a very active person; apart from his work as a doctor, he also co-funded the local museum and was a member of the town council.<ref name="zena">{{cite web|url= http://zena-in.cz/clanek/bozena-capkova-sberatelka-maminka-slavnych-potomku |title= Božena Čapková, sběratelka, maminka slavných potomků |language= cs |publisher= ŽENA-IN.cz |author= Jana Ládyová |date= 23 June 2016 |access-date= 28 July 2016}}</ref> Despite opposing his father's [[materialism|materialist]] and [[positivism|positivist]] views, Karel Čapek loved and admired his father, later calling him “a good example... of the generation of [[Czech national revival|national awakeners]]”.{{sfn|Ort|2013|p= 19}} Karel's mother, Božena Čapková, was a homemaker.<ref name="oregon" /> Unlike her husband, she did not like life in the country, and she suffered from long-term depression.<ref name="zena" /> Despite that, she assiduously collected and recorded local folklore, such as legends, songs and stories.{{sfn|Ort|2013|pp= 17-18}} Karel was the youngest of three siblings.

After finishing elementary school in Úpice, Karel moved with his grandmother to [[Hradec Králové]], where he started attending high school.

=== World War I and Interwar period ===

Exempted from military service due to the spinal problems that would haunt him his whole life, Čapek observed World War I from Prague. His political views were strongly affected by the war, and as a budding journalist he began to write on topics like [[nationalism]], [[totalitarianism]] and [[consumerism]].<ref name="js">[[James Sallis]], Review of '' Karel Capek: Life and Work'' by Ivan Klima. ''The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction'', (pp. 37–40).</ref> Through social circles, the young author developed close relationships with many of the political leaders of the nascent Czechoslovak state, including [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]], Czechoslovak patriot and the first [[President of Czechoslovakia]], and his son [[Jan Masaryk]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Liehm |first=Antonín J. |title=Closely Watched Films: The Czechoslovak Experience |publisher=Routledge |date=2016 |isbn=978-1138658059}} (p. 56)</ref><ref name="newsome">{{cite book|last=Newsome |first=Geoffrey |editor-last=Čapek |editor-first=Karel |title=Letters from England |publisher=Continuum |date=2001 |chapter=Introduction |isbn=0-8264-8485-9}} (p. 3)</ref> who would later become minister of foreign affairs. T. G. Masaryk was a regular guest at Čapek's "[[Friday Men]]" [[Garden party|garden parties]] for leading Czech intellectuals. Čapek was also a member of Masaryk's ''[[Hrad (politics)|Hrad]]'' political network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dejinyasoucasnost.cz/archiv/2007/1/t-g-masaryk-zrozen-k-mytu-/ |title=T. G.

[[Image:Vysehrad_Nahrobek_Karla_Capka_a_Olgy_Scheinpflugove.jpg|right|thumb|Tomb of Karel Čapek and Olga Scheinpflugová at Vyšehrad cemetery]]
Čapek began his writing career as a journalist. With his brother Josef, he worked as an editor for the Czech paper ''[[Národní listy]]'' ''(The National Newspaper)'' from October 1917 to April 1921.<ref name="pamatnik">{{cite web|url=http://www.capek-karel-pamatnik.cz/EN/vismo/dokumenty2.asp?id_org=200086&id=1012 |title=The Life of Karel Čapek |publisher=Památník Karla Čapka |date=16 February 2015 |access-date=20 July 2016}}</ref> Upon leaving, he and Josef joined the staff of ''[[Lidové noviny]]'' ''(The People's Paper)'' in April 1921.<ref>Sarka Tobrmanova-Kuhnova, "Introduction," to Karel Čapek, "Believe in People: the essential Karel Čapek."London, Faber and Faber 2010, 2010, {{ISBN|9780571231621}} (p.xxiv-xxv).</ref>

Čapek's early attempts at fiction were short stories and plays for the most part written with his brother [[Josef Čapek|Josef]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aktualne.cz/wiki/osobnosti/zaslouzili-umelci/josef-capek/r~0fccd4cceffd11e3b78f0025900fea04/ |title=Josef Čapek |publisher=aktualne.cz |language=cs |date=9 June 2014 |access-date=18 July 2016}}</ref><ref name="radio">{{cite web|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/czechs/karel-capek |title=Karel Čapek |publisher=Český rozhlas |date=12 January 2000 |author=Nick Carey |access-date=20 July 2016}}</ref> Čapek's first international success was ''[[R.U.R.]]'', a dystopian work about a bad day at a factory populated with [[Sentience|sentient]] [[android (robot)|androids]]. The play was translated into English in 1922, and was being performed in the UK and America by 1923. Throughout the 1920s, Čapek worked in many writing genres, producing both fiction and non-fiction, but worked primarily as a journalist.<ref name="js" /> In the 1930s, Čapek's work focused on the threat of brutal [[national socialist]] and fascist dictatorships; by the mid-1930s, Čapek had become "an outspoken anti-fascist".<ref name="js" /> He also became a member of [[International PEN]] Club. Established, and was the first president of the Czechoslovak PEN Club.<ref name="sayer" />

=== Late life and death ===

In 1935 Karel Čapek married actress [[Olga Scheinpflugová]], after a long acquaintance.<ref name="oregon" />{{sfn|Klíma|2001|pp=200-206}} In 1938 it became clear that the Western allies, namely [[French Third Republic|France]] and the [[United Kingdom]], would fail to fulfil the pre-war treaty agreements, and they [[Western betrayal|refused to defend]] Czechoslovakia against [[Nazi Germany]]. Although offered the chance to go to exile in England, Čapek refused to leave his country&nbsp;– even though the Nazi [[Gestapo]] had named him "public enemy number two".<ref name="mailbox">{{cite web|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/mailbox/mailbox-2012-03-03 |title=Radio Prague - Mailbox |publisher=Český rozhlas |date=3 March 2012 |access-date=19 July 2016}}</ref> While repairing flood damage to his family's summer house in [[Stará Huť]], he contracted a common cold.<ref name="pamatnik" /> As he had suffered all his life from [[spondyloarthritis]] and was also a heavy smoker, Karel Čapek died of [[pneumonia]], on 25 December 1938.<ref name="radio" />

Surprisingly, the Gestapo was not aware of his death. Several months later, just after the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|German invasion of Czechoslovakia]], Nazi agents came to the Čapek family house in Prague to arrest him.<ref name="ct24" /> Upon discovering that he had already been dead for some time, they arrested and interrogated his wife Olga.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spisovatele.cz/karel-capek |title=Olga Scheinpflugová |publisher=Osobnosti.cz |language=cs |access-date=20 July 2016}}</ref> His brother Josef was arrested in September and eventually died in the [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]] in April 1945.<ref>[[Adam Roberts (British writer)|Adam Roberts]], "Introduction", to  ''RUR & War with the Newts''.

== Writing ==
[[Image:Karel_%C4%8Capek_-_rukopis.jpg|thumb|Karel Čapek's handwriting]]
Karel Čapek wrote on a wide variety of subjects. His works are known for their precise description of reality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slovoasmysl.ff.cuni.cz/node/16 |title=Karel Čapek - pragmatista a ironik |publisher=Slovo a smysl (Word & Sense) |language=cs |access-date=18 July 2016}}</ref> Čapek is renowned for his work with the [[Czech language]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Jedlička |first=Alois |date=1991 |title=Jazykové a jazykovědné zájmy Karla Čapka |url=http://nase-rec.ujc.cas.cz/archiv.php?lang=en&art=6978 |journal=Naše řeč |language=cs |volume=74 |issue=1 |pages=6–15 |access-date=18 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aktualne.cz/wiki/osobnosti/zaslouzili-umelci/karel-capek/r~e6f033fac0f411e3a1ef002590604f2e/ |title=Karel Čapek |publisher=aktualne.cz |language=cs |date=10 April 2014 |access-date=18 July 2016}}</ref> He is known as a [[science fiction author]], who wrote before science fiction became widely recognized as a separate genre. Many of his works also discuss ethical aspects of industrial inventions and processes already anticipated in the first half of the 20th century. These include [[mass production]], [[nuclear weapon]]s and intelligent artificial beings such as robots or androids. His most productive years were during [[History of Czechoslovakia (1918–1938)|The First Republic of Czechoslovakia]] (1918–1938).

Čapek also expressed fear of social disasters, dictatorship, violence, human stupidity, the unlimited power of corporations, and greed.  Čapek tried to find hope, and the way out.

From the 1930s onward, Čapek's work became increasingly [[anti-fascist]], [[anti-militarist]], and critical of what he saw as "irrationalism".<ref name="ds">[[Darko Suvin]], "Capek, Karel" in
''[[Twentieth-Century Science-Fiction Writers]]'' by Curtis C. Smith. St. James Press, 1986, {{ISBN|0-912289-27-9}} (p.842-4).</ref>

[[Ivan Klíma]], in his biography of Čapek, notes his influence on modern Czech literature, as well as on the development of Czech as a written language. Čapek, along with contemporaries like [[Jaroslav Hašek]], spawned part of the early 20th-century revival in written Czech thanks to their decision to use the vernacular. Klíma writes, "It is thanks to Čapek that the written Czech language grew closer to the language people actually spoke".<ref name=Klima />  Čapek was also a translator, and his translations of French poetry into the language inspired a new generation of Czech poets.<ref name=Klima />

His other books and plays include [[Detective fiction|detective stories]], novels, [[fairy tale]]s and [[Play (theatre)|theatre plays]], and even a book on gardening.<ref>''The Gardener's Year'', illustrated by Josef Čapek. First published in Prague, 1929. English edition London: George Allen & Unwin, 1931</ref> His most important works attempt to resolve problems of [[epistemology]], to answer the question: "What is knowledge?" Examples include ''Tales from Two Pockets'', and the first book of the trilogy of novels ''[[Hordubal]],'' ''Meteor,'' and ''An Ordinary Life.'' He also co-wrote (with his brother Josef) the libretto for [[Zdeněk Folprecht (composer)|Zdeněk Folprecht]]'s opera ''Lásky hra osudná'' in 1922.<ref>"Karel Čapek". ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]''. 2nd edition, Oxford, 2001.</ref>

After World War II, Čapek's work was only reluctantly accepted by the communist government of Czechoslovakia, because during his life he had refused to accept communism as a viable alternative. He was the first in a series of influential non-Marxist intellectuals who wrote a newspaper essay in a series called "Why I am not a Communist".<ref>K. Čapek, [http://capek.misto.cz/english/communist.html ''Why I am not a Communist?''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105062749/http://capek.misto.cz/english/communist.html |date=5 January 2010 }} [[Přítomnost]] 4 December 1924.</ref>

In 2009 (70 years after his death), a book was published containing extensive correspondence by Karel Čapek, in which the writer discusses the subjects of [[pacifism]] and his [[Conscientious Objectors|conscientious objection]] to military service with lawyer Jindřich Groag from [[Brno]]. Until then, only a portion of these letters were known.<ref>[http://nakladatelstvi-nzb.abchistory.cz/index.html?pod=/_0002-vojaku-vladimire----karel-capek--jindrich-groag-a-odpiraci-vojenske-sluzby.htm ''„Vojáku Vladimíre...“: Karel Čapek, Jindřich Groag a odpírači vojenské služby''], Nakladatelství Zdeněk Bauer, Prague 2009.</ref>

[[Arthur Miller]] wrote in 1990: <blockquote>I read Karel Čapek for the first time when I was a college student long
ago in the Thirties. There was no writer like him...prophetic assurance mixed with surrealistic humour and hard-edged social satire: a unique combination...he is a joy to read.<ref>Miller, Arthur. "Foreword" to ''Toward the Radical Center: A Karel Capek Reader'',

== Etymology of ''robot'' ==
[[Image:R.U.R._by_Karel_%C4%8Capek_1939.jpg|right|thumb|R.U.R. theatrical poster, 1939]]
Karel Čapek introduced and made popular the frequently used international word ''[[robot]]'', which first appeared in his play ''[[R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)|R.U.R.]]'' in 1920. While it is frequently thought that he was the originator of the word, he wrote a short letter in reference to an article in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' [[etymology]] in which he named his brother, painter and writer [[Josef Čapek]], as its actual inventor.<ref>[http://capek.misto.cz/english/robot.html Karel Capek&nbsp;– Who did actually invent the word "robot" and what does it mean?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204135259/http://capek.misto.cz/english/robot.html |date=4 February 2012 }} at capek.misto.cz</ref><ref>[[Ivan Margolius]],'The Robot of Prague',  Newsletter, The Friends of Czech Heritage no. 17, Autumn 2017, pp. 3 - 6.  https://czechfriends.net/images/RobotsMargoliusJul2017.pdf</ref> In an article in the Czech journal ''[[Lidové noviny]]'' in 1933, he also explained that he had originally wanted to call the creatures ''laboři'' (from Latin ''labor'', work). However, he did not like the word, seeing it as too artificial, and sought advice from his brother Josef, who suggested ''roboti'' (''robots'' in English).

The word ''robot'' comes from the word ''robota''. The word robota means literally "[[corvée]]", "serf labor", and figuratively "drudgery" or "hard work" in Czech. It also means "work", "labor" in [[Slovak (language)|Slovak]], archaic Czech, and many other Slavic languages (e.g., [[Bulgarian (language)|Bulgarian]], [[Russian (language)|Russian]], [[Serbian (language)|Serbian]], [[Polish (language)|Polish]], [[Macedonian (language)|Macedonian]], [[Ukrainian (language)|Ukrainian]], etc.). It derives from the reconstructed [[Proto-Slavic language|Proto-Slavic]] word [[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/orbota|*orbota]], meaning "work, hard work, obligatory work for the king, or a short form used for plowing".
