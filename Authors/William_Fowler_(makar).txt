'''William Fowler''' (c. 1560–1612) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[poet]] or [[makar]] (royal bard), [[writer]], [[courtier]], and [[translator]].

==Early life==
William Fowler was the son of [[Janet Fockart]] and William Fowler, a well connected [[Edinburgh]] [[Burgess (title)|burgess]].<ref>Margaret H. B. Sanderson, ''Mary Stewart's People'', (Edinburgh, 1987), p. 91.</ref> He graduated from [[St Leonard's College (University of St Andrews)|St Leonard's College]], [[St Andrews]] in 1578. By 1581 he was in [[Paris]] studying civil law. At this time he published ''An ansvver to the calumnious letter and erroneous propositions of an apostat named M. Io. Hammiltoun'' a pamphlet criticising [[John Hamilton (controversialist)|John Hamilton]] and other [[Catholics]] in [[Scotland]], who he claimed had driven him from that country. In response, two Scottish Catholics, Hamilton and Hay manhandled him and dragged him through the streets to the [[Collège de Navarre]].

Following his return to Scotland, he visited [[London]] to retrieve some money owed to his father by [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]. Here he frequently visited the house of [[Michel de Castelnau]], Sieur de Mauvissiere, where he met [[Giordano Bruno]], currently staying there. He was soon recruited by [[Francis Walsingham]] to act as a spy until 1583, by which time he felt his consorting with French Catholics was compromising his religious integrity. His letters to Walsingham mention his widowed mother's concern at his role in London and her moneylending activities, and information he obtained in January 1583 from the exiled Scottish [[Esmé Stewart, 1st Duke of Lennox|Duke of Lennox]].<ref>''Calendar of State Papers, Scotland'': volume 6: 1581-83 (1910), 262-3, 265-6.</ref> In May 1583, while William was intriguing in London, his sister Susannah Fowler married John Drummond the king's doorkeeper and son of [[Robert Drummond of Carnock]], their son was the poet [[William Drummond of Hawthornden]].

==A Career at Court==
In September 1584 he met the German traveller [[Lupold von Wedel]] in Edinburgh and told him that he been teaching [[James VI and I|King James]] the [[art of memory]].<ref>Gottfied von Bülow, 'Journey Through England and Scotland made by Lupold von Wedel in the years 1584 and 1585', in ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society'', vol. 9 (London, 1895), p. 247.</ref> Fowler later noted that while he was teaching James the art of memory, the king taught him poetry and ''imprese'' or [[emblems]].<ref>Henry Meikle, ''Works of William Fowler'', vol. 3 (STS, Edinburgh, 1940), p. xix fn. 4.</ref>

Fowler was part of a literary circle around King James which has become known as the "[[Castalian Band]]" and included [[Alexander Montgomerie]], [[John Stewart of Baldynneis]], [[Alexander Hume]], [[Thomas Hudson (poet)|Thomas]] and [[Robert Hudson (poet)|Robert Hudson]], and James VI himself. In 1591 Fowler contributed a prefatory sonnet ''To the Only Royal Poet'' to James VI's poem the ''Furies'', printed in ''His Majesties Poeticall Exercises'';<ref>James VI, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6oQ8AAAAcAAJ&source=gbs_navlinks_s ''His Majesties Poeticall Exercises'', (Edinburgh, Robert Waldegrave, 1591)], (p. 7)</ref> while James, in return, commended, in verse, Fowler's ''[[Triumphs]] of [[Petrarch|Petrarke]]''.

Fowler dedicated his ''Triumphs'' to [[Jean Fleming, Countess of Cassilis|Jean Fleming]], wife of the [[Lord Chancellor of Scotland|Chancellor]], [[John Maitland, 1st Lord Maitland of Thirlestane|John Maitland of Thirlestane]]. [[Mary Beaton|Mary Beaton, Lady Boyne]] the former companion of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], and "E. D.", probably Elizabeth Douglas, wife of [[John Cockburn of Ormiston|Samuel Cockburn]] of [[Ormiston|Temple-Hall]],<ref>Gordon MacGregor, 'Cockburn of Ormiston', ''Red Book of Scotland'', vol. 3 (2020), pp. 78-9.</ref> contributed sonnets in praise of the author. Fowler dedicated a translation from [[Ludovico Ariosto|Ariosto]] to Mary Beaton, who was a member of his literary circle. He wrote an epitaph for Elizabeth Douglas, Samuel Cockburn's wife, who died in 1594.<ref>Sebastiaan Verweij, ''The Literary Culture of Early Modern Scotland'' (Oxford, 2017), pp. 84-87.</ref>

==Secretary to the queen==
In 1589 he was appointed to the diplomatic mission to [[Denmark]] to arrange the marriage of [[James VI]] to [[Anne of Denmark]] with [[John Skene, Lord Curriehill|John Skene]]. He was a paid negotiator for the city of [[Edinburgh]], charged with raising the profile of the burgh.<ref>John Marwick, ''Extracts from the Burgh Records of Edinburgh: 1573-1589'' (Edinburgh, 1882), pp. 543-4: Clare McManus, 'Marriage and the Performance of the Romance Quest: Anne of Denmark and the Stirling Baptismal Ceremonies for Prince Henry', in L.A.J.R. Houwen, A.A. MacDonald, S.L. Mapstone, Peeters, ''A Palace in the Wild: Essays on Vernacular Culture and Humanism in Late-Medieval and Renaissance Scotland'' (Leuven, 2000), p. 177.</ref> Fowler wrote from Denmark about the progress of the marriage negotiations to the English ambassador in Scotland [[William Ashby (died 1593)|William Ashby]] who forwarded his letter to [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]].<ref>[[Thomas Wright (antiquarian)|Thomas Wright]], ''Queen Elizabeth and Her Times: A Series of Original Letters'', vol. 2 (London, 1838), p. 392, misdated by Wright to 1588.</ref>

King James sailed to Norway to meet his bride. On 28 November 1589, at Oslo, Fowler was appointed private secretary and Master of Requests to [[Anne of Denmark]]. He retained these positions when Anne went to England.<ref>[[National Records of Scotland]], Privy Seal Register, PS1/66 f78r.</ref> 

Fowler returned to Scotland before James VI, and planned to rejoin the royal party in Denmark in April 1590.<ref>[[Marguerite Wood]],'' Extracts from the Burgh Records of Edinburgh: 1589-1603'', vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1927), p. 17.</ref> The English diplomat in Edinburgh [[Robert Bowes (diplomat)|Robert Bowes]] reported to Burghley and Walsingham that Fowler had obtained two letters in cipher, one to the [[Francis Hay, 9th Earl of Erroll|Earl of Erroll]] and the other mysteriously addressed to "Assuerus the Painter". Fowler gave the letters to the [[Provost of Edinburgh]], [[Sir John Arnot]] to show them to the [[Privy Council of Scotland|Privy Council]]. The [[Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell|Earl of Bothwell]] said the letters meant nothing to him, Bowes thought they looked like letters he had previously seen which referred to alleged Catholic and Spanish plots.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 257, 264-5.</ref>

Fowler left Scotland for a while on 17 September 1591 with the [[Walter Scott, 1st Lord Scott of Buccleuch|Laird of Buccleuch]], and seems to have attended the [[University of Padua]].<ref>Henry Meikle, ''Works of William Fowler'', vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1914), pp. xxv, cxxv.</ref> At this time [[Giacomo Castelvetro]], an Italian writer, served James VI and Anne of Denmark as a language tutor and secretary. He lodged at Janet Fockart's house where the ambassador Robert Bowes stayed, and Eleanor Bowes made friends with his wife, Isotta de Canonici, the widow of [[Thomas Erastus]].<ref>Henry Meikle, ''Works of William Fowler'', vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1914), pp. cxxvi, cxxviii, cxxx, citing [[British Library]] Harley 7004.</ref>

[[John Geddie (secretary)|John Geddie]], a calligrapher, was also a secretary to the queen. He drew out a Latin acrostic poem for a manuscript of Fowler's discourse on the history of mathematics titled 'Methodi, sive compendii mathematici'. This work was not printed.<ref>Sebastiaan Verweij, ''The Literary Culture of Early Modern Scotland'' (Oxford, 2017), p. 98.</ref>

Fowler wrote an account of the [[Masque at the baptism of Prince Henry|entertainments at the baptism]] of [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince Henry]] in 1594,<ref>[http://www.northernrenaissance.org/rare-shewes-and-singular-inventions-the-stirling-baptism-of-prince-henry/ Bath, Michael, 'Rare Shewes, the Stirling Baptism of Prince Henry', in ''Journal of the Northern Renaissance'', no.4 (2012)]</ref> and taught the queen the art of memory, a subject upon which he also wrote a treatise. 

In April 1595 the queen went to Stirling to see her son [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince Henry]]. She had joined a factional struggle, and the court at Stirling was filled with her adversaries. [[Roger Aston]] wrote that Fowler had stayed behind in Edinburgh for this reason.<ref>[[Thomas Birch]], ''Memoirs of the Reign of Queen Elizabeth'', vol. 1 (London, 1754), p. 228, as 'Mr William Foulis'.</ref>

In 1598 Fowler agreed to send intelligence from the royal court to England, and was to be known by the cipher 'Ib' in correspondence. [[George Nicholson (diplomat)|George Nicholson]] mentioned in March that Fowler needed encouragement and reassurance by a letter from the [[Secretary of State (England)|Secretary]], [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Sir Robert Cecil]]. However, nothing from him or mentioning 'Ib' survives, except perhaps a newsletter of March 1602 that reached Sir Robert Cecil and appears to be in his handwriting.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 13 part 2 (Edinburgh, 1969), p. xvii, xxvii, 151, 164, 169; ''HMC Salisbury Hatfield'', vol. 14 (London, 1923), pp. 211-212.</ref>

Shortly after the [[Union of the Crowns]], on 5 April 1603, before joining the king in London, Fowler wrote a note describing the devices or [[emblem|emblems]] embroidered on a bed belonging to [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], which seems to have been in place in a chamber at [[Holyrood Palace]] with matching chairs. The bed was also recorded by his nephew, William Drummond of Hawthornden.<ref>Michael Bath, ''Emblems for a Queen'' (London, 2008), pp. 17-20.</ref> On 28 April he wrote to Robert Cecil from Edinburgh, enclosing royal letters (from Anne of Denmark) and offering his service.<ref>''HMC Calendar of the Manuscripts of the Marquis of Salisbury'', vol. 15 (London, 1930), pp. 60, 70.</ref>

==England==
He was confirmed as secretary and Master of Requests to Anne of Denmark.<ref>Edmund Lodge, ''Illustrations of British History'', vol. 3 (London, 1791), p. 209.</ref> He joined the royal progress towards [[Wilton House]] in Somerset, and on 12 August visited [[Loseley Park]] where a timepiece inspired his poem, ''Uppon a Horologe of the Clock at Sir George More's at his Place of Loseley''.<ref>John Nichols, ''Progresses of James the First'', vol. 1 (London, 1828), pp. 251, 260-1.</ref>

In September 1603, he met [[Arbella Stuart]] at [[Woodstock Palace]], and sent her two sonnets, one addressed to her, and the ''Upon a Horologe of the Clock at Loseley'' which contains a partial anagram of her name.<ref>[http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=chadwyck_ep/uvaGenText/tei/chep_1.0828.xml;chunk.id=d139;toc.depth=1;toc.id=d139;brand=default The sonnets sent to Arbella are nos 260 & 261 in Meikle's edition], the approximate anagram is in 'BELL ... DISTEMPERED HAPP'.</ref> Fowler wrote to the [[Gilbert Talbot, 7th Earl of Shrewsbury|Earl]] and [[Mary Talbot, Countess of Shrewsbury|Countess of Shrewsbury]] that Arbella was the "eighth wonder of the world," and "the phoenix of her sex."<ref>G. R. Batho., ed., ''HMC Calendar of Talbot Papers'' (London, 1971), pp. 229-30, 233,  (Lambeth Talbot K. fols. 121, 163): Edmund Lodge, ''Illustrations of British History'', vol. 3 (London, 1838), pp. 16-19, 47-9.</ref>



On 26 May 1604 he wrote to Lord Cecil apologising for delays in expediting Anna of Denmark's business. He said suits and patents were "in the custody of the women" and he blamed one "Margarete" who usurped authority in the queen's name.<ref>''HMC Salisbury Hatfield'', vol. 16, pp. 114-5.</ref> In July, at [[Greenwich Palace]], he drew up the queen's warrant in support of founding a college or university at [[Ripon]] in Yorkshire, which was promoted by Cecily Sandys, widow of the Bishop [[Edwin Sandys (bishop)|Edwin Sandys]], and supported by [[Bess of Hardwick]].<ref>[[Francis Peck]], ''Desiderata Curiosa'', vol. 1 (London, 1779), p. 284.</ref> In October 1604 he wrote to the Earl of Shrewsbury from [[Hampton Court]] with court news and news of death of the son of the [[George Home, 1st Earl of Dunbar|Earl of Dunbar]], who he called "our great St George, the Lord of Berwick."<ref>[[Edmund Lodge]], ''Illustrations of British History'', vol. 3 (London, 1838), pp. 97-99.</ref>

Fowler wrote to Cecil in February 1605 mentioning their recent meeting at [[Woodstock Palace]]. Anne of Denmark had placed in his custody portraits of [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria]] and [[Isabella Clara Eugenia]]. They had been gifts to her from the [[Spanish Netherlands|Flemish]] ambassador, the [[Charles de Ligne, 2nd Prince of Arenberg|Count of Arenberg]], in September 1603. She was considering giving them to a friend in Scotland. Fowler thought they would be better at Cecil's house, [[Theobalds]]. In the mean time they were to be displayed in the gallery at [[Somerset House]].<ref>Karen Hearn, ''Dynasties'' (London, 1995), p. 182: ''HMC Salisbury Hatfield'', vol. 17 (London, 1938), p. 54.</ref>

Fowler attended the royal progress in 1605 and was at [[Drayton House|Drayton]], [[Henry Mordaunt, 4th Baron Mordaunt|Lord Mordaunt's]] house in August.<ref>William Shaw, ''HMC Lord De L'Isle & Dudley'', vol. 3 (London, 1936), p. 188.</ref>

His older brother William died in 1606, and he was made a burgess of Edinburgh.<ref>Charles Boog Watson, ''Roll of Edinburgh Burgesses'' (Edinburgh, 1929), p. 191.</ref> The poet [[John Donne]] had some hopes of gaining a position in the queen's household by Fowler's means, and heard from a clerk of her council, Mr Powell, that Fowler might retire. Donne wrote to Henry Goodyer (1571-1627), a gentleman of the king's privy chamber about his interest in employment in the queen's household in June 1607, fearing that Fowler's retirement might scupper his chances, but no more is known and Fowler did not retire. The rumour was perhaps connected with death of Fowler's older brother in Edinburgh.<ref>[[Edmund Gosse]], ''Life and Letters of John Donne'', vol. 1 (London, 1899), pp. 155-6.</ref>

In 1609 he received a grant of 2,000 acres (8&nbsp;km²) in [[Ulster]] as reward for his services. In October 1610 he answered [[William Trumbull (diplomat)|William Trumbull]]'s inquiry about the Scottish [[Order of the Thistle]], an order of knighthood of doubtful history. Fowler believed that there had been an Order, founded to honour Scots who fought for [[Charles VII of France]]. He thought it had been discontinued in the time of James V, and could say nothing of its ceremonies or regalia.<ref>E. K. Purnell & A. B. Hinds, ''HMC Downshire'', vol. 2 (London, 1936), pp. xxii-xxiii, 388.</ref>

Fowler wrote two poems to [[Mary Middlemore]], a lady in waiting in the queen's household, one including her name, "My harte as Aetna burnes, and suffers MORE / Paines in my MIDDLE than ever MARY proved".<ref>Sara M. Dunnigan, ''Eros and Poetry at the Courts of Mary Queen of Scots and James VI'' (Basingstoke, 2002), p. 208 fn. 6: Alastair Fowler, ''Literary names: Personal names'' (Oxford, 2012), p. 84.</ref>

He died in 1612 and was buried in [[St Margaret's, Westminster]].

His will mentions a chain of gold of jewels worth £300, and three diamond rings, presents from Anne of Denmark, which he left to his brother John Fowler. The [[Gilbert Talbot, 7th Earl of Shrewsbury|Earl of Shrewsbury]] owed him £843. The will was witnessed by James Cleghorn, a waiter in the queen's household, and James Gibson, the king's bookbinder.<ref>E. Margaret Thompson, 'The Daughter of Anne of Denmark's Secretary', ''Scottish Historical Review'', 19:73 (October 1921), pp. 21-32 at p. 24: TNA PROB 11/122/81.</ref>

==The green tree and the anagram==
At [[Somerset House|Denmark House]], the queen had a green palm tree with a crown and a Latin epigram in gilt letters on the queen's fruitfulness by Fowler based on his anagram of her name; "Anna Brittanorum Regina" - "In anna regnantium arbor". The palm tree was admired and described by [[John Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Weimar]] who visited London in 1613.<ref>Alastair Fowler, ''Literary names: Personal names'' (Oxford, 2012), p. 84: [https://archive.org/details/englandasseenbyf00ryew/page/166 William Brenchley Rye, ''England as Seen by Foreigners'' (London, 1865), p. 166]: Alessandra Petrina, ''Machiavelli in the British Isles'' (Ashgate, 2009), p. 102.</ref> This seems to have been a salt, described in 1620 with other items of the queen's tableware scheduled for sale as; " a salt of gold in pieces, having a clock within crystal, the foot of same being gold triangle wise, the cover thereof being a castle, and out of the same castle a green tree, the flowers being diamonds and rubies in roses, the same clock salt and crystal garnished with gold, diamonds, and rubies, wanting a dial in the same clock".<ref>[https://archive.org/details/fderaconventione07ryme/page/n597 Thomas Rymer, ''Foedera'', vol. 7 part 3 (Hague, 1739), pp. 130, 132].</ref>

==Legacy==
His nephew William Drummond of Hawthornden bequeathed a manuscript collection of seventy-two sonnets, entitled ''The Tarantula of Love'', and a translation (1587) from the Italian of the ''Triumphs of Petrarke'' to the library of the [[University of Edinburgh]]. Two other volumes of his manuscript notes, poems and other papers. are preserved among the Drummond of Hawthornden manuscripts held by the [[National Library of Scotland]]. Fowler's poetry was featured in the 1803 publication by [[John Leyden]] of ''Scottish Descriptive Poems''.
