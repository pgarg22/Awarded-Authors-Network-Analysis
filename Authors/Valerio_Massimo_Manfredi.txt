'''Valerio Massimo Manfredi''' (born 8 March 1943) is an Italian historian, writer, essayist, [[archaeologist]] and journalist.

==Biography==
He was born in [[Piumazzo di Castelfranco Emilia]] [[province of Modena]] and, after getting a degree in Classical Arts at the [[University of Bologna]], he became an [[archaeology|archaeologist]] at the [[Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore|Catholic University of Milan]], specialising in the [[topography]] of the Ancient World.<ref name="manfredi">{{cite web|title=Valerio Massimo Manfredi |url=http://www.valeriomassimomanfredi.it|access-date=7 January 2012|language=it}}</ref>

At the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore itself, he taught from 1980 to 1986, then moved on to an academic career at the University of Venice (1987) and then at the [[Loyola University of Chicago]], the [[Sorbonne University]] in Paris and the [[Bocconi University]] in Milan. However, due to his numerous commitments, both national and international, he can no longer lecture full-time, but he holds a visiting professor role.<ref>[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/ea.cgi?141213 Valerio Massimo Manfredi] on [[ISFDB]]</ref>

Between the 1970s and the 1980s, he has undertaken the "Anabasis" expeditions for the reconstruction of the itinerary of the [[Ten Thousand (Greek)|Ten Thousand]]'s retreat. This expedition covered a total of 18,000&nbsp;km, with 2,000 photographs being taken. He undertook and led numerous other expeditions, such as: [[Lavinium]], [[Forum Gallorum]] and Forte Urbano in Italy, [[Túcume]] (Peru), [[Har Karkom]] and other overseas locations.<ref>[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/valerio-massimo-manfredi/ Enciclopedia Treccani] (in Italian)</ref>

He has also held a series of conferences and seminars at the [[University of Oxford]], [[University of California]], National [[University of Canberra]], Universidad de Antiochia, Universidad de Bilbao, Universidad Internacional Menendez Pelayo in Tenerife and many others.<ref name="manfredi" />

He has published many academic essays and articles and he has written several best-selling novels (amounting to a total of about 8 million copies sold worldwide). He also writes on many newspapers and magazines as a scientific journalist both in Italy (e.g., "Il Messaggero", "Panorama", "Archeo", "Focus") and in Spain (Spanish edition of "Focus" and "El Mundo").<ref>[https://www.piper.de/autoren/valerio-m-manfredi-80 Piper], his German publisher (in German)</ref>

His novel ''The Last Legion'' was the basis for [[The Last Legion|the movie]] of the same title, released in 2007 and starring [[Colin Firth]], [[Ben Kingsley]] and others; his ''Alexander Trilogy'' has been bought by [[Universal Pictures]] for yet another cinematic rendition of the story of [[Alexander the Great]].<ref name="manfredi" /> He has also written the screenplays for ''Marco d'Aviano'' and ''Gilgamesh'' and he has adapted ''Le Memorie di Adriano'' for cinema screening. Furthermore, he has hosted the television series ''Stargate – linea di confine'' for three seasons already on the Italian TV channel LA7 and he will also host ''Impero'' (''Empire'') on the very same channel.

On 11 February 2021, Manfredi and fellow writer Antonella Prenner were found unconscious at his home in [[Rome]], after suffering a domestic incident caused by an accidental gas leak. They were hospitalized in [[Grosseto]]; their conditions are described as critical.<ref>[https://roma.repubblica.it/cronaca/2021/02/11/news/valerio_massimo_manfredi_trovato_esanime_in_casa_a_roma-287128642/ Lo scrittore Valerio Massimo Manfredi trovato esanime in casa a Roma: è grave]</ref>
