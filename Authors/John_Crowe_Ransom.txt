'''John Crowe Ransom''' (April 30, 1888 – July 3, 1974) was an American educator, scholar, literary critic, poet, essayist and editor.  He is considered to be a founder of the [[New Criticism]] school of literary criticism.   As a faculty member at [[Kenyon College]], he was the first editor of the widely regarded ''[[Kenyon Review]]''.  Highly respected as a teacher and mentor to a generation of accomplished students, he also was a prize-winning poet and essayist.

==Background==
John Crowe Ransom was born on April 30, 1888, in [[Pulaski, Tennessee]].<ref name="illinois">{{cite web|url=http://www.maps-legacy.org/poets/m_r/ransom/chronology.htm|title=A John Crowe Ransom Chronology}}</ref> His father, John James Ransom (1853–1934) was a [[Methodist]] minister.<ref name="illinois"/> His mother was Sara Ella (Crowe) Ransom (1859–1947).<ref name="illinois"/> He had two sisters, Annie Phillips and Ella Irene, and one brother, Richard.<ref name="illinois"/> He grew up in [[Spring Hill, Tennessee|Spring Hill]], [[Franklin, Tennessee|Franklin]], [[Springfield, Tennessee|Springfield]], and [[Nashville, Tennessee]].<ref name="illinois"/> He was home schooled until age ten.<ref name="illinois"/> From 1899 to 1903, he attended the [[Bowen School]], a public school whose headmaster was Vanderbilt alumnus [[Angus Gordon Bowen]].<ref name="illinois"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/speccol/exhibits/preparatory/bowen.shtml|title=Preparatory Academies and Vanderbilt University|first=Vanderbilt University Special|last=Collections|date=28 August 2006|website=www.library.vanderbilt.edu}}</ref>

==Career==
Ransom taught Latin for one year at the [[Hotchkiss School]] alongside [[Samuel Claggett Chew]] (1888–1960).<ref name="illinois"/> He was then appointed to the English department at [[Vanderbilt University]] in 1914. During the [[World War I|First World War]], he served as an [[artillery]] officer in [[France]].<ref name="illinois"/> After the war, he returned to Vanderbilt.<ref name="illinois"/> He was a founding member of the [[Fugitives (poets)|Fugitives]], a Southern literary group of sixteen writers that functioned primarily as a kind of poetry workshop and included [[Donald Davidson (poet)|Donald Davidson]], [[Allen Tate]], and [[Robert Penn Warren]]. Under their influence, Ransom, whose first interest had been philosophy (specifically [[John Dewey]] and American [[pragmatism]]) began writing poetry. His first volume of poems, ''Poems about God'' (1919), was praised by [[Robert Frost]] and [[Robert Graves]]. The Fugitive Group had a special interest in [[Modernist poetry]] and, under Ransom's editorship, started a short-lived but highly influential magazine, called ''The Fugitive'', which published American Modernist poets, mainly from the South (though they also published Northerners like [[Hart Crane]]). Out of all the Fugitive poets, Norton poetry editors Richard Ellmann and Robert O'Clair opined that, "[Ransom's poems were] among the most remarkable," characterizing his poetry as "quirky" and "at times eccentric."<ref>Ellmann, Richard and Robert O'Clair, eds. ''The Norton Anthology of Poetry''. Second Edition. New York: W. W. Norton Co., 1973. 467.</ref>

In 1930, alongside eleven other [[Southern Agrarians]], he published the conservative, [[agrarianism|Agrarian]] manifesto ''I'll Take My Stand: The South and the Agrarian Tradition'', which assailed the tide of [[industrialism]] that appeared to be sweeping away traditional Southern culture.<ref>Conkin, Paul K. The Southern Agrarians. Knoxville, TN: University of Tennessee Press, 1988.</ref> The Agrarians believed that the Southern tradition, rooted in the pre-Civil War agricultural model, was the answer to the South's economic and cultural problems. His contribution to ''I'll Take My Stand'' is his essay ''Reconstructed but Unregenerate'' which starts the book and lays out the Southern Agrarians' basic argument. In various essays influenced by his Agrarian beliefs, Ransom defended the manifesto's assertion that modern industrial capitalism was a dehumanizing force that the South should reject in favor of an agrarian economic model. However, by the late 1930s he began to distance himself from the movement, and in 1945, he publicly criticized it.<ref>Conkin, Paul K. ''The Southern Agrarians''. Knoxville, TN: University of Tennessee Press, 1988.</ref> He remained an active essayist until his death even though, by the 1970s, the popularity and influence of the New Critics had seriously diminished.

In 1937, he accepted a position at [[Kenyon College]] in [[Gambier, Ohio]].<ref name="illinois"/> He was the founding editor of the ''[[Kenyon Review]]'', and continued as editor until his retirement in 1959.<ref>Thomas Daniel Young, ''Gentleman in a Dustcoat: A Biography of John Crowe Ransom,'' Louisiana State University Press, Southern Literary Studies Series, January 1977, pp. 428–30. {{ISBN|0-8071-0255-5}}.</ref> In 1966, he was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]].

He has few peers among twentieth-century American university teachers of humanities; his distinguished students included [[Donald Davidson (poet)|Donald Davidson]], [[Randall Jarrell]], [[George Lanning]], [[Robert Lowell]], [[Andrew Nelson Lytle|Andrew Lytle]], [[Allen Tate]], [[Peter Matthew Hillsman Taylor|Peter Taylor]], [[Robie Macauley]], [[Robert Penn Warren]], [[E.L. Doctorow]], [[Cleanth Brooks]],  [[Richard M. Weaver]], [[James Wright (poet)|James Wright]], and [[Constantinos Patrides]] (himself a Rhodes Scholar, who dedicated his monograph on John Milton's ''[[Lycidas]]'' to Ransom's memory). His literary reputation is based chiefly on two collections of poetry, ''Chills and Fever'' (1924) and ''Two Gentlemen in Bonds'' (1927).<ref>Thomas Daniel Young, ''John Crowe Ransom: an annotated bibliography,'' (Modern Critics and Critical Schools). Volume 3 of Garland, bibliographies of modern critics and critical schools. Volume 354 of Garland reference library of the humanities.

Hence Ransom's reputation as a poet is based on the fewer than 160 poems he wrote and published between 1916 and 1927. In 1963, the poet/critic and former Ransom student [[Randall Jarrell]] published an essay in which he highly praised Ransom's poetry: <blockquote> In John Crowe Ransom's best poems every part is subordinated to the whole, and the whole is accomplished with astonishing exactness and thoroughness. Their economy, precision, and restraint gives the poems, sometimes, an original yet impersonal perfection . . . And sometimes their phrasing is magical—light as air, soft as dew, the real old-fashioned enchantment. The poems satisfy our nostalgia for the past, yet themselves have none. They are reports . . . of our world's old war between power and love, between those who efficiently and practically know and those who are "content to feel/ What others understand." And these reports of battles are, somehow, bewitching . . . Ransom's poems profess their limitations so candidly, almost as a principle of style, that it is hardly necessary to say they are not poems of the largest scope or the greatest intensity. But they are some of the most original poems ever written, just as Ransom is one of the best, most original, and most sympathetic poets alive; it is easy to see that his poetry will always be cared for, since he has written poems that are perfectly realized and occasionally almost perfect."<ref>Jarrell, Randall. "Fifty Years of American Poetry." ''No Other Book: Selected Essays''. New York: HarperCollins, 1999.</ref></blockquote> Despite the brevity of his poetic career and output, Ransom won the [[Bollingen Prize for Poetry]] in 1951.  His 1963 ''Selected Poems'' received the [[National Book Award]] the following year.<ref name=nba1964>

He primarily wrote short poems examining the ironic and unsentimental nature of life (with domestic life in the American South being a major theme). An example of his Southern style is his poem "Janet Waking", which "mixes modernist with old-fashioned country rhetoric."<ref>Tillinghast 1997</ref> He was noted as a strict formalist, using both regular rhyme and meter in almost all of his poems. He also occasionally employed archaic diction. Ellman and O'Clair note that "[Ransom] defends [[Formalism (literature)|formalism]] because he sees in it a check on bluntness, on brutality. Without formalism, he insists, poets simply rape or murder their subjects."

He was a leading figure of the school of literary criticism known as the [[New Criticism]], which gained its name from his 1941 volume of essays ''The New Criticism''. The New Critical theory, which dominated American literary thought throughout the middle 20th century, emphasized [[close reading]], and criticism based on the texts themselves rather than on non-textual bias or non-textual history. In his seminal 1937 essay, "Criticism, Inc." Ransom laid out his ideal form of literary criticism stating that, "criticism  must become more scientific, or precise and systematic." To this end, he argued that personal responses to literature, historical scholarship, linguistic scholarship, and what he termed "moral studies" should not influence literary criticism. He also argued that literary critics should regard a poem as an aesthetic object.<ref>Ransom, John Crowe. Criticism, Inc." The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism. Ed Vincent Leitch, et al. New York, W. W. Norton Co., 2001. 11108-1118.</ref> Many of the ideas he explained in this essay would become very important in the development of The New Criticism. "Criticism, Inc." and a number of Ransom's other theoretical essays set forth some of the guiding principles that the New Critics would build upon. Still, his former students, specifically [[Allen Tate]], [[Cleanth Brooks]], and [[Robert Penn Warren]], had a greater hand in developing many of the key concepts (like "close reading") that later came to define the New Criticism.

In 1951, he was awarded the [[Russell Loines Award for Poetry]] from the [[National Institute of Arts and Letters]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Letter from Mark Van Doren, Secretary, The American Academy of Arts and Letters, NYC in invitation to their Ceremonial on May 2, 1951, accompanied by a program for the event. |url=https://www.afb.org/HelenKellerArchive?a=d&d=A-HK01-02-B020-F04-004&e=-------en-20--1--txt--------3-7-6-5-3--------------0-1 |website=American Foundation for the Blind Helen Keller Archive |publisher=American Foundation for the Blind |location=New York, NY |language=English |date=25 May 1951}}</ref>
