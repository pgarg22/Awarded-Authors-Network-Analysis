'''Jaco Van Dormael''' (born 9 February 1957) is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] film director, screenwriter and playwright. His films especially focus on a respectful and sympathetic portrayal of people with mental and physical [[disability|disabilities]].

Van Dormael spent his childhood travelling around Europe, before going on to study filmmaking at the [[INSAS (film school)|INSAS]] in Brussels, where he wrote and directed his first short film, ''[[Maedeli la brèche]]'' (1981), which received the Honorary Foreign Film Award at the [[Student Academy Awards]]. Van Dormael's feature debut, ''[[Toto the Hero|Toto le héros]]'' (1991), won the [[Caméra d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].

Five years later, ''[[The Eighth Day (1996 film)|Le huitième jour]]'' (1996) played at Cannes, where his two leading actors, [[Daniel Auteuil]] and [[Pascal Duquenne]], were jointly awarded the prize for [[Best Actor Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actor]]. His third feature film, ''[[Mr. Nobody (film)|Mr. Nobody]]'' (2009), won six [[Magritte Awards]], including [[Magritte Award for Best Film|Best Film]] and [[Magritte Award for Best Director|Best Director]].

==Early life==
Jaco Van Dormael was born in [[Ixelles]]. Belgium, on 9 February 1957 to a Belgian couple. Van Dormael was raised in Germany until age seven, when his family returned to Belgium. At his birth, he had nearly been strangled by the umbilical cord and received an insufficient supply of oxygen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.screenrush.co.uk/stars/star-4645/biography/|title=Jaco van Dormael – Biography|access-date=25 January 2012|publisher=Screenrush}}</ref> It was feared that he might end up [[Mental retardation|mentally impaired]]. This trauma may partly account for the recurring themes in his films, which explore the worlds of people with mental and physical [[disability|disabilities]].

He delighted in working with children and for a while pursued a career as a [[circus clown]]. He became a producer of children's entertainment with the Theatre de Galafronie, Theatre Isocele and Theatre de la Guimbarde.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemotions.com/Jaco-van-Dormael-nm52126|title=Jaco van Dormael|access-date=25 January 2012|publisher=Cinemotions.com|language=fr|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130325055322/http://www.cinemotions.com/Jaco-van-Dormael-nm52126|archive-date=25 March 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> After developing an interest in filmmaking, he enrolled at the [[INSAS (film school)|INSAS]] in Brussels and later the [[Louis Lumière College]] in Paris.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinergie.be/personne/van_dormael_jaco|title=Jaco van Dormael|access-date=25 January 2012|publisher=Cinergie.be|language=fr}}</ref> As a children's entertainer, childhood and innocence would become strong themes throughout his work.

==Career==

===Early work===
In the 1980s, Van Dormael directed a number of short films. While he was a student at the [[INSAS (film school)|INSAS]], he wrote and directed the children's story ''[[Maedeli la brèche]]''.<ref>{{cite web|first=Théo|last=Salina|url=http://www.cinergie.be/webzine/maedeli_la_breche_de_aco_van_dormael|title=Maedeli-la-brèche de Jaco Van Dormael|date=1 March 1999|access-date=25 January 2012|publisher=Cinergie|language=fr}}</ref> The short film received the Honorary Foreign Film Award at the 1981 [[Student Academy Awards]] presented by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/saa/winners/winners.pdf |title=Student Film Award Winners |access-date=25 January 2012 |publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229173821/http://www.oscars.org/awards/saa/winners/winners.pdf |archive-date=29 February 2012 }}</ref> The following year Van Dormael directed ''[[Stade 81]]'', a documentary short film about the [[Paralympic Games]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinergie.be/film/stade_81|title=Stade 81 (Jaco Van Dormael)|access-date=25 January 2012|publisher=Cinergie|language=fr}}</ref> He later directed the short films ''Les voisins'' (1981), ''[[L'imitateur]]'' (1982), ''Sortie de secours'' (1983), and ''De boot'' (1985). His most famous short of the period is ''[[È pericoloso sporgersi (1984 film)|È pericoloso sporgersi]]'' (1984) which won the Grand Prix in international competition at the [[Clermont-Ferrand#Culture|Clermont-Ferrand International Short Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinergie.be/film/e_pericoloso_sporgersi|title=E pericoloso sporgersi (Jaco Van Dormael)|access-date=25 January 2012|publisher=Cinergie|language=fr}}</ref>

===Mainstream breakthrough===
Van Dormael made his feature-length debut in 1991 with ''[[Toto the Hero|Toto le héros]]'' (''Toto the hero''), a tale about a man who believes his life was "stolen" from him when he was switched at birth, told in a complex mosaic of [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback]]s and [[dream sequence]]s, sometimes with almost a [[Stream of consciousness writing|stream of consciousness]] effect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinergie.be/film/toto_le_heros|title=Toto le héros (Jaco Van Dormael)|access-date=25 January 2012|publisher=Cinergie|language=fr}}</ref> ''Toto le héros'' was ten years in the making as Van Dormael rewrote the script at least eight times. In 1985, two Belgian producers read a version of the script, and over the next five years they raised about $3.5 million, a huge amount for a Belgian production, all in public money from Belgium, the European Community and state television in France and Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1992-03-18/entertainment/ca-3914_1_van-dormael|title=Jaco Van Dormael's 'Toto Le Heros' has impressed audiences and critics worldwide|first=Steve|last=Weinstein|date=18 March 1992|access-date=25 January 2012|work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> Van Dormael premiered ''Toto le héros'' at the [[1991 Cannes Film Festival]], where it won the [[Camera d'Or]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-03-27/entertainment/9201280352_1_van-dormael-michel-bouquet-heros|title='Toto Le Heros' Is Warm But A Bit Too Polished|first=Dave|last=Kehr|author-link=Dave Kehr|date=27 March 1992|access-date=25 January 2012|work=Chicago Tribune|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]}}</ref> The film was released to the public later that year.

[[File:Jaco Van Dormael - 66ème Festival de Venise.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Van Dormael and De Mey]]
In 1995, Van Dormael participated in the 1995 project ''[[Lumière and Company|Lumière et compagnie]]'' (''Lumière and Company''). This work is an anthology of very short works (on average 50–60 seconds) contributed by international film directors in which each used the original [[Auguste and Louis Lumière]]'s motion picture camera to make his film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19961206/REVIEWS/612060302/1023|title=Lumiere & Company |first=Roger|last=Ebert|author-link=Roger Ebert|date=6 December 1996|access-date=25 January 2012|work=Chicago Sun-Times|publisher=[[Sun-Times Media Group]]}}</ref> ''The Kiss'' is the 52-second film made by director Jaco Van Dormael featuring actor [[Pascal Duquenne]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gosprout.org/film/pro06/kiss.htm|title=The Kiss|access-date=25 January 2012|publisher=Sprout Film Festival|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607081729/http://www.gosprout.org/film/pro06/kiss.htm|archive-date=7 June 2010}}</ref> At the same time, Van Dormael was at work writing his next major work.

He wanted to make a more linear film than ''Toto le héros'', one which explored the world through the eyes of a man with [[Down syndrome]]. Van Dormael's next film, ''[[The Eighth Day (1996 film)|Le huitieme jour]]'' (''The Eighth Day''), accomplishes this with the chance meeting and friendship between Georges, played by [[Pascal Duquenne]], and Harry, an unhappy divorced businessman portrayed by [[Daniel Auteuil]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cincinnati.com/freetime/movies/mcgurk/eighthday.html|title='Eighth Day' takes remarkable journey|first=Margaret A|last=McGurk|access-date=30 January 2012|work=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020175850/http://www.cincinnati.com/freetime/movies/mcgurk/eighthday.html|archive-date=20 October 2006}}</ref> Van Dormael's interest in people with mental and physical [[disability|disabilities]] stems from an interest in their "talent for life, for loving life, that we often lack."<ref name="eightday">{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704193415/http://www.filmfestivals.com/cannes96/cfile10.htm|archive-date=4 July 2008|url=http://www.filmfestivals.com/cannes96/cfile10.htm|title=Cannes 96 – Le huitième jour, Belgium/France/UK, Jaco van Dormael|access-date=30 January 2012|publisher=Filmfestivals.com}}</ref> He sought to explore the concept of two worlds (that of Georges and that of Harry) existing simultaneously and yet separately.<ref name="eightday"/> ''Le huitième jour'' premiered at the [[1996 Cannes Film Festival]], where it was nominated for the [[Palme d'Or]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4690/year/1996.html|title=Festival de Cannes: Le huitième jour|access-date=18 September 2009|publisher=[[Cannes Film Festival]]}}</ref> It did win the [[Best Actor Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actor]] award at the festival, which was given to both Pascal Duquenne and Daniel Auteuil.<ref name="cannes96">{{cite web|url=http://www.cannes.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=507&Itemid=2457647&lang=en_EN|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130119000842/http://www.cannes.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=507&Itemid=2457647&lang=en_EN|url-status=dead|archive-date=19 January 2013|title=The 90s: a Festival full of discoveries|access-date=30 January 2012|publisher=Cannes.com}}</ref> This was the first time in the festival's history that two actors had shared the award.<ref name="cannes96"/> The film received four [[Joseph Plateau Awards]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmtage-tuebingen.de/fft-wordpress/?p=2411|title=Le huitième jour – Am achten Tag|publisher=Festival International du Film Francophone|access-date=30 January 2012|language=de|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001445/http://www.filmtage-tuebingen.de/fft-wordpress/?p=2411|archive-date=4 March 2016}}</ref> and was nominated for a [[César Award]] and the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/?param=/film/25226|title=HFPA – The Eight Day|access-date=30 January 2012|work=[[Golden Globe]]|publisher=[[Hollywood Foreign Press Association]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130414221536/http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/?param=/film/25226|archive-date=14 April 2013}}</ref> ''Le huitième jour'' grossed $33 million worldwide on a budget of $5 million, making it Van Dormael's highest-grossing film to that point.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=eighthday.htm|title=The Eighth Day (1996)|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|access-date=30 January 2012}}</ref>

===''Mr. Nobody'' and after===
[[File:Cast Mr Nobody 66ème Festival de Venise (Mostra).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Van Dormael with the cast of ''Mr. Nobody'' at the 2009 [[Venice Film Festival]]]]
Van Dormael began seeking to film ''[[Mr. Nobody (film)|Mr. Nobody]]'' in 2001, an attempt that lasted six years before the director was able to make his English-language feature debut in 2007.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/mr-nobody-cares-two-somebodies-143344|title='Mr. Nobody' cares for two somebodies|first=Borys|last=Kit|date=17 July 2007|access-date=30 January 2012|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]}}</ref> This project differed from other Belgian productions in being filmed in English instead of in one of Belgium's main languages.<ref name="route">{{cite news|first=Tobias|last=Grey|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117985769/|title=Belgian directors go genre route|work=Variety |publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|date=15 May 2008|access-date=24 May 2008}}</ref> The director explained, "The story came to me in English.

There are also some incredible English-speaking actors I wanted to work with."<ref name="route"/> The production budget for ''Mr. Nobody'' was €37 million, ranking it the most expensive Belgian film as of 2008.<ref name="route"/> The budget was approved before casting was done, based on the prominence of the director's name and the strength of his script. The film utilizes [[nonlinear narrative]] and the [[many-worlds interpretation]] to tell the life story of the last mortal on Earth, Nemo Nobody, portrayed by [[Jared Leto]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Josh|last=Tyler|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Jared-Leto-As-The-Oldest-Man-On-Earth-5790.html|title=Jared Leto As The Oldest Man on Earth|publisher=Cinema Blend|date=17 July 2007|access-date=30 January 2012}}</ref>

In August 2014, Van Dormael began filming his fourth feature film, ''[[The Brand New Testament|Le Tout Nouveau Testament]]'' (''The Brand New Testament''), with [[Catherine Deneuve]], [[Yolande Moreau]] and [[Benoît Poelvoorde]], a comedy in which God (Poelvoorde) is alive and lives in Brussels with his daughter.<ref name="nouveau">[http://www.moustique.be/culture/cinema/298851/silence-jaco-tourne "Silence, Jaco tourne"], ''Moustique'' magazine, 19 August 2014 (in French).</ref> It premiered at the [[2015 Cannes Film Festival|68th Cannes Film Festival]] on 17 May 2015 to critical acclaim.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Debruge|first1=Peter|title=Cannes Film Review: 'The Brand New Testament'|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/festivals/the-brand-new-testament-review-cannes-film-festival-1201498770/|access-date=9 July 2015|work=Variety|date=17 May 2015}}</ref>

==Themes==
Van Dormael's films, while few, have strong common themes between them. They make distinctive use of naive [[voiceover]] and examine the world from an innocent perspective (the young Thomas in ''[[Toto the Hero|Toto le héros]]'', the mentally handicapped protagonist of ''[[The Eighth Day (1996 film)|Le huitième jour]]'', and the unborn child of ''[[Mr. Nobody (film)|Mr. Nobody]]''). These characters views are often colorful, imaginative, and somewhat removed from reality, with slight elements of [[surrealism|surreal]] imagery used to illustrate their active imaginations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://torino.repubblica.it/cronaca/2011/12/12/news/l_ottavo_giorno_di_van_dormael_vecchio_film_per_nuovi_fan-26485640/|title=L'Ottavo giorno di Van Dormael "vecchio" film per "nuovi" fan|first1=Chiara|last1=Incisa|first2=Elena|last2=Seita|date=21 December 2011|access-date=10 December 2012|work=[[la Repubblica]]|publisher=[[Gruppo Editoriale L'Espresso]]|language=it}}</ref>

His films also typically end with a death, which is portrayed not as a tragedy, but as a happy moving on where the deceased looks down happily at the world below.<ref name="Van Malderghem">{{cite video|people=Van Malderghem, Olivier (Director)|year=2010|title=Hors Limites, le Cinéma de Jaco Van Dormael|language=fr|medium=Motion picture|publisher=Cinémathèque de la Communauté française de Belgique}}</ref> ''Between Heaven and Earth'' ends with a birth, but it is similarly handled the passing of a character into a new world. This pattern is continued in ''Mr. Nobody'', where two deaths open the film and a unique twist on death at the end of the film conveys a wistful sense of happiness.

Van Dormael makes prominent use of nostalgic [[Traditional pop|standards]] music, as well, featuring "Boum!" by [[Charles Trenet]] in ''Toto le héros'' and "Mexico" by [[Luis Mariano]] in ''Le huitième jour'' as recurring themes. ''Mr. Nobody'' used "[[Mr. Sandman]]" as its recurring musical theme.<ref name="Van Malderghem"/>

All of Van Dormael's films contain [[Surrealism|surreal]] elements. In his first two films, these moments were few, like dancing flowers in ''Toto le héros'' or Georges flying around the room in ''Le huitième jour''. ''Mr. Nobody'' makes much more extensive use of surreal imagery throughout the film.<ref>{{cite web|first=James|last=Walling|url=http://www.praguepost.com/night-and-day/cinema/5010-chance-and-consequences.html|title=Chance and consequences|work=[[The Prague Post]]|date=14 July 2010|access-date=10 December 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724065201/http://www.praguepost.com/night-and-day/cinema/5010-chance-and-consequences.html|archive-date=24 July 2010}}</ref>

Both ''Toto le héros'' and ''Le huitième jour'' prominently featured characters with [[Down Syndrome]], and portrayed these characters lovingly, emphasizing their childlike characteristics.<ref>{{cite news|first=Sheila|last=Johnston|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/jaco-van-dormael--the-return-of-a-hero-801402.html|title=Jaco van Dormael – The return of a hero|work=[[The Independent]]|date=28 March 2008|access-date=10 December 2012}}</ref>
