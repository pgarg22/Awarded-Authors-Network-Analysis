==Legacy==

===Runeberg torte===
According to a legend, Fredrika Runeberg is the creator of the famous Finnish pastry, the [[Runeberg torte]], although her recipe is also said to be based upon an earlier recipe by [[confectioner]] Lars Astenius from Porvoo. The torte is typically served on Johan Ludvig Runeberg's birthday, on 5 February, which is an [[Flag flying days in Finland|established flag flying day in Finland]]. The torte tradition has spread all over Finland, commemorating the country's [[national poet]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sls.fi/FredrikaRuneberg/runebergs_bakelse.htm |title=Fredrika Runeberg: Runebergs bakelse |publisher=Svenska Littaratursällskapet i Finland |date= |accessdate=2014-05-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331045725/http://www2.sls.fi/FredrikaRuneberg/runebergs_bakelse.htm |archive-date=March 31, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
