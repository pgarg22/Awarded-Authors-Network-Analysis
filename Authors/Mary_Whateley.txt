'''Mary Darwall''' (née '''Whateley'''; 1738 – 5 December 1825), who sometimes wrote as '''Harriett Airey''', was an English [[poet]] and [[playwright]]. She belonged to the [[Shenstone Circle]] of writers gathered round [[William Shenstone]] in the [[English Midlands]]. She later explored subjects that included the nature of female friendship and the place of women writers.

==Life and work==
Born in [[Beoley]], [[Worcestershire]] into the prosperous farming family of William Whateley (1694–1763), Mary Whateley was the youngest of nine children, of whom seven survived infancy.<ref name="DNB">Breen, Jennifer, "Whateley (married name Darwall), Mary", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Oxford, UK: OUP) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/60786 Retrieved 10 January 2016, pay-walled]</ref> She had little formal education, but by 1759 she was having poems published in ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'' as Harriett Airey or Airy.<ref name="Blackwell">{{Citation |year=2011 |contribution=Whateley, Mary, later Darwall |contribution-url=http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405156691_chunk_g978140515669125_ss1-18 |editor1-last=Baines |editor1-first=Paul |editor2-last=Ferraro |editor2-first=Julian |editor3-last=Rogers |editor3-first=Pat |title=The Wiley-Blackwell Encyclopedia of Eighteenth-Century Writers and Writing |location=Oxford |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |isbn=9781405156691 |url=http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/book?id=g9781405156691_9781405156691 |access-date=2012-10-27}}</ref>

In 1760 Whateley moved to [[Walsall]] in [[Staffordshire]] to work as a housekeeper to her brother. There her poetry was noticed in 1761 by [[William Shenstone]], who was impressed: "That she has generous and delicate sentiments, as well as ingenuity, may, I think, be fairly concluded from the whole tenor of her Poetry."<ref name="DNB"/>

Her first volume of ''Original Poems on Several Occasions'' appeared from [[Robert Dodsley]] in 1764. It held 30 works, including [[ode]]s and [[hymn]]s and a satire, "The Power of Destiny", which considers how different her existence would have been had she been born male.<ref name="Blackwell" /> It went through several editions in London, Dublin and Walsall.<ref name="Feminist">''The Feminist Companion to Literature in English'', eds Virginia Blain, Patricia Clements and Isobel Grundy (London: Batsford, 1990), p. 266.</ref> She stands up in a Dedication for the place of women in literature, saying she looks down "with a just contempt on the invidious reflections... of Prejudice" against that.<ref>Quoted in Paula R.

In 1766 Whateley married [[John Darwall]], a widowed clergyman and father of five or six, by whom she had six further children.<ref name="Feminist"/> Despite family responsibilities and helping her husband to run a printing press, she continued to write, producing hymns for her husband's congregation, perhaps the best known of these being the tune Darwall, usually sung to "Rejoice, the Lord is King". This appears in 221 hymnals.<ref>[http://www.hymnary.org/tune/darwall_darwall Retrieved 10 January 2016.]</ref> She also wrote a play for a local theatre.<ref name="DNB"/> At least five of her poems appeared in [[Miscellany|miscellanies]] between 1770 and 1785. ''Liberty: An Elegy'', for example, appeared in that form in 1775 and again in 1783.<ref>Digital Miscellanies Index [http://dmi.gnostyx.com:8899/exist/rest/db/dmi/persons/person_0001494.xml Retrieved 10 January 2016.] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304095111/http://dmi.gnostyx.com:8899/exist/rest/db/dmi/persons/person_0001494.xml |date=4 March 2016}}</ref> Her poem "Female Friendship", which appeared in ''The Westminster Magazine'' in April 1776, puts this in a context of self-sacrificing heterosexual friendship.<ref>E.

On the death of her husband in 1789, Mary Darwall moved to [[Deritend]], [[Birmingham]], and then in 1793 to [[Newtown, Powys|Newtown]] in [[Montgomeryshire]], from where she published in 1794 a second collection, ''Poems on Several Occasions''.<ref name="DNB"/> This included some work by others, probably two of her daughters, one of whom, Elizabeth, would publish ''The Storm, with Other Poems'' in 1810, to which Mary in turn is thought to have contributed four poems.<ref name="Feminist"/><ref>Introductory matter in ''Eighteenth-Century Women Poets'', ed.
