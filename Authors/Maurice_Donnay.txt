'''Charles Maurice Donnay''' (12 October 1859 &ndash; 31 March 1945) was a French [[dramatist]].

==Biography==
Donnay was born of middle-class parents in Paris in 1859. His father was a railway engineer and initially Donnay followed a similar profession, studying at the [[École Centrale Paris|École centrale des arts et manufactures]] in 1882.

With [[Alphonse Allais]], Donnay started by writing material for the celebrated cabaret ''le Chat noir''.

Donnay made his serious debut as a dramatist on the little stage of the Chat Noir with ''Phryne'' (1891), a series of Greek scenes. 
This was followed by ''Lysistrata'', a four-act comedy, was produced at the Grand Théâtre in 1892 with Mme Rejane in the title part. 
With ''Amants'' in 1895 he won a great success, and the play was hailed by [[Jules Lemaître]] as the ''Berenice'' of contemporary French drama. 
His plays were performed by famous actors including [[Cécile Sorel]], Réjane et [[Lucien Guitry]].

On 14 February 1907, Donnay was elected a member of the [[Académie française]], replacing the late [[Albert Sorel]].
