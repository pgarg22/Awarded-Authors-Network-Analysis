{{short description|American literary critic}}
'''Richard Palmer Blackmur''' (January 21, 1904 – February 2, 1965) was an American [[literary critic]] and [[poet]].

==Life==
He was born and grew up in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]].  
He attended [[Cambridge High and Latin School]], but was expelled in 1918.<ref>Fraser, p. xxxv</ref>
An [[autodidact]], Blackmur worked in a bookshop after high school, and attended lectures at [[Harvard University]] without enrolling. He was managing editor of the literary quarterly ''[[Hound & Horn]]'' from 1928 to 1930, at which time he resigned, although he continued to contribute to the magazine until its demise in 1934.

In 1930 he married Helen Dickson.<ref>Fraser, p. xxxv</ref>
In 1935 he published his first volume of criticism, ''The Double Agent''; during the 1930s his criticism was influential among many [[modernist poets]] and the [[New Critics]].<ref>Alexander Leitch, [http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/blackmur_richard_p.html ''A Princeton Companion''], Princeton University Press (1978).</ref>

In 1940 Blackmur moved to [[Princeton University]], where he taught first creative writing and then English literature for the next twenty-five years.  In 1947, he was awarded a Rockefeller Fellowship.<ref>Fraser, p. xxxvi</ref>

He founded and directed the university's Christian Gauss Seminars in Criticism, named in honor of his colleague [[Christian Gauss]]. He met other influential poets while he taught at Princeton. They include [[W. S. Merwin]] and [[John Berryman]]. Merwin later published an anthology dedicated to Blackmur and Berryman, and a book of his own poetry (''The Moving Target'') dedicated to Blackmur. 
He taught at [[Cambridge University]] in 1961—62.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vqronline.org/articles/1981/autumn/fraser-r-p-blackmur/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106010810/http://www.vqronline.org/articles/1981/autumn/fraser-r-p-blackmur/ |archivedate=2009-01-06 }}</ref>
