'''Philip Schultz''' (born 1945 in [[Rochester, New York]]) is an American poet, and the founder/director of [[The Writers Studio]], a private school for fiction and poetry writing based in New York City. He is the author of several collections of poetry, including ''The God of Loneliness, Selected and New Poems'' ([[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]], 2010); ''[[Failure (poem)|Failure]]'' ([[Harcourt (publisher)|Harcourt]], 2007), winner of the 2008 [[Pulitzer Prize]] in Poetry; ''Living in the Past'' (Harcourt, 2004); and ''The Holy Worm of Praise'' (Harcourt, 2002). He is also the author of ''Deep Within the Ravine'' [[Viking Penguin]], 1984), which was the [[Lamont Poetry Selection]] of the [[Academy of American Poets]]; ''Like Wings'' (Viking Penguin, 1978, winner of an [[The American Academy of Arts and Letters|American Academy & Institute of Arts and Letters]] Award as well as a [[National Book Award|National Book Award nomination]]), and the  poetry chapbook, ''My Guardian Angel Stein'' (1986). His work has been published in  [[The New Yorker]],  [[The Paris Review]],  [[Slate magazine|Slate]], [[Poetry magazine]], [[The Gettysburg Review]], [[The Southern Review]], and [[Georgia State University|Five Points]], among others, and he is the recipient of a  [[Fulbright]] Fellowship in Poetry to Israel and a 2005  [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in Poetry. He has also received, among others, a [[National endowment for the arts|National Endowment for the Arts]] Fellowship in Poetry (1981), a New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowship in Poetry (1985), as well as the Levinson Prize from  [[Poetry magazine]]. Schultz is also the author of a memoir, ''My Dyslexia'', published by [[W.W. Norton]] in 2011, and a new book of poetry, ''The Wherewithal'' (W. W. Norton), published in February 2014.

Schultz founded The Writers Studio in 1987 after teaching at [[New York University]] for 10 years, where he founded and directed their graduate writing program from 1984 to 1988. The Writers Studio utilizes a method that emphasizes technique and emotional connection, making writers aware of the distinction between the actual writer and a narrative persona. Today it features an online program, workshops in New York City, [[San Francisco]], [[Tucson]], and [[Amsterdam]], as well as a celebrated reading series in New York City.

Philip Schultz lives in East Hampton, NY with his wife, sculptor Monica Banks and their two sons, Elias and August.
