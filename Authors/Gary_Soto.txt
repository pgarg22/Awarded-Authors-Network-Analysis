Soto's father died in 1957, when he was five years old. As his family had to struggle to find work, he had little time or encouragement in his studies.<ref name="notable"/> Soto notes that in spite of his early academic record, while at high school he found an interest in poetry through writers such as [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[John Steinbeck]], [[Jules Verne]], [[Robert Frost]] and [[Thornton Wilder]].<ref name="faq">{{Cite web |url=http://www.garysoto.com/faq.html |title=Soto's FAQ page |access-date=August 29, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104104818/http://www.garysoto.com/faq.html |archive-date=January 4, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

==Work==
Soto's poetry focuses on daily experiences,<ref name="notable">[http://www.notablebiographies.com/news/Sh-Z/Soto-Gary.html Gary Soto at NotableBiographies.com], accessed August 28, 2009.</ref> often reflecting on his life as a [[Chicano]]. Regarding his relationship with the Mexican-American community, Soto commented "as a writer, my duty is not to make people perfect, particularly Mexican Americans. I’m not a cheerleader. I’m one who provides portraits of people in the rush of life."<ref name="faq"/>

Soto writes novels, plays and memoirs, and has edited several literary anthologies. His story "The No-Guitar Blues" was made into a film,<ref name="faq"/> and he produced another film based on his book "The Pool Party."<ref name="bio"/> He is a prolific writer of children's books.<ref name="notable"/>

About his work [[Joyce Carol Oates]] noted "Gary Soto's poems are fast, funny, heartening, and achingly believable, like Polaroid love letters, or snatches of music heard out of a passing car; patches of beauty like patches of sunlight; the very pulse of a life."<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/One-Kind-Faith-Gary-Soto/dp/0811841170 Amazon reviews], accessed November 24, 2009.</ref>

In 2014, Soto received the [[Phoenix Award]] for his 1994 children's book ''Jesse''. The award committee stated: "''Jesse'' is both a coming-of-age story of one Mexican-American boy with a poetic sensibility and the story of a community and a country at a difficult time—facing poverty and prejudice and war, problems we are still facing today. ''Jesse'' offers an unembellished slice of life in Vietnam-era [[Fresno, California]]."<ref>[http://issuu.com/meetingexpectations/docs/chla_newsletter_autumn_2013 ''ChLA Newsletter''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714184931/http://issuu.com/meetingexpectations/docs/chla_newsletter_autumn_2013 |date=July 14, 2014 }}, Vol. 20, Issue 2 (Autumn 2013). pp. 6–7.
