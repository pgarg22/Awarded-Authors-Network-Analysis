'''Antoni Malczewski''' (3 June 1793 – 2 May 1826) was a Polish [[romanticism|romantic]] poet, known for his only work, "a [[narrative poem]] of dire [[pessimism]]", ''Maria'' (1825).

At the times, prominent and scandalizing was his autodestructive romance with a married woman, Zofia Rucińska, who had a mental illness.

==Biography==
Malczewski was born to a wealthy family in either [[Volhynia]] or [[Warsaw]], and attended school in [[Krzemieniec]] (modern-day Kremenets, Ukraine), but did not graduate.<ref name="RomanticEra">{{cite encyclopedia | title = Malczewski, Antoni | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era, 1760-1850 | editor = Christopher John Murray | volume = 2 | publisher = Taylor & Francis | year = 2004 | isbn = 1-57958-422-5 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofro002unse_v8y9/page/709 709–710] | url = https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofro002unse_v8y9/page/709 }}</ref> He joined the army of the short-lived [[Duchy of Warsaw]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1811,<ref name="RomanticEra" /> and remained in the army of [[Congress Poland]] under [[Alexander I of Russia|Emperor Alexander]] from 1815.<ref name="mkl">{{cite encyclopedia | title = Malczewski | encyclopedia = [[Meyers Konversations-Lexikon]] | edition = 4th | year = 1890 | volume = 11 | pages = 145–146 | url = http://www.retrobibliothek.de/retrobib/seite.html?id=110842|language=de}}</ref> He was wounded in the foot in a duel in 1816 and so had to leave the army.<ref name="mkl" />

After leaving the army, he spent several years traveling through western Europe, staying some time in [[Paris]], climbing [[Mont Blanc]] in 1818, and spending a good portion of his inherited fortune.<ref name="RomanticEra" /><ref name="mkl" /> He returned to his estate in Volhynia in 1821, where he began an ill-fated affair with a married woman and began writing.<ref name="RomanticEra" /> He moved to Warsaw in 1824, where he published the poetic novel ''Maria'' at his own expense in 1825, and died in poverty the next year in unclear circumstances.<ref name="RomanticEra" />

==Work==
Malczewski's fame rests almost solely upon that of ''Maria'', published near the end of his life and popularized in the decade following his death (an English translation appeared in 1835). Considered a masterpiece of [[Polish Romanticism]], it tells the tale of a young noble woman who marries above her station, and so incurs the wrath of her husband's family, who plot revenge. It is generally held to be most influenced by [[Lord Byron]], whom Malczewski had met in [[Venice]] during his travels around western Europe, though it is considerably more gloomy and [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] than Byron's work. Malczewski is sometimes considered part of the "[[Ukrainian school]]" in Polish poetry, though others consider his work to stand uniquely separate. ''Maria'' was also influential on later Polish poets, especially [[Adam Mickiewicz]], and on writer [[Joseph Conrad]].<ref name="RomanticEra" /><!-- ref is for this whole paragraph -->
