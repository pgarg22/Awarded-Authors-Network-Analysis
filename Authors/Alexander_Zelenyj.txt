'''Alexander Zelenyj''' is a Canadian author of speculative fiction. He is known for his seamless merging of genres in his stories, resulting in a visionary, original and difficult-to-define style.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paulobrito.pt/2014/12/15/songs-for-the-lost-by-alexander-zelenyj/|title=songs for the lost by alexander zelenyj|work=porta VIII|access-date=2016-02-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160213110930/http://www.paulobrito.pt/2014/12/15/songs-for-the-lost-by-alexander-zelenyj/|archive-date=2016-02-13|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="fright.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.fright.com/edge/SongsForTheLost1.htm|title=Songs for the Lost by Alexander Zelenyj|work=fright.com}}</ref> All of his fiction has literary underpinnings, though his work is infused with genre elements running the gamut from [[magic realism|magical realism]], [[Horror fiction|horror]], [[science fiction]], [[Noir fiction|noir]], [[Historical fiction|historical]], [[Western fiction|western]], [[Bizarro fiction|Bizarro]], to [[surrealism]].<ref name="sci-fi-online.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.sci-fi-online.com/00_revs/r2009/book/09-03-20_experiments3am.htm|title=Experiments at 3 Billion A.M.|work=sci-fi-online.com}}</ref> For this reason the term "[[Slipstream (genre)|slipstream]]" has often been used to describe his work, though some reviewers consider the term inadequate to define Zelenyj's unclassifiable style.<ref name="sci-fi-online.com"/>

==Style==

Thematically, Zelenyj's fiction often explores the darker side of the human condition. His stories are known for being emotionally harrowing, with elements of the surreal and bizarre interwoven among their plots.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://agonycolumn.com/agony/news/2009/04-27-09-news.htm|title=This Just In .... Agony Column News|work=agonycolumn.com}}</ref> This emotional impact often has a distinctly melancholy character, with violence, depression, and suicide being recurring themes.<ref name="nancyo">{{cite web|url=http://www.oddlyweirdfiction.com/2015/01/about-as-dark-as-it-gets-folkssongs-for.html|title=oddly weird fiction|author=NancyO|work=oddlyweirdfiction.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishfantasysociety.org/reviews/experiments-at-3-billion-a-m-by-alexander-zelenyj-book-review/|title=Experiments at 3 Billion A.M. By Alexander Zelenyj. Book review|work=The British Fantasy Society}}</ref> The Canadian landscape figures prominently in much of Zelenyj's work, specifically his home city of [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], [[Ontario]] and its surrounding environs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourwindsor.ca/community-story/4867023-windsor-author-explores-theme-of-loss-in-new-collection/|title=Windsor author explores theme of loss in new collection|work=ourwindsor.ca}}</ref> More generally, the city is often portrayed as a sinister and immoral place, and is frequently juxtaposed against the natural peace and beauty of rustic settings.<ref name="nancyo"/> A historical element recurs throughout his fiction, with a focus on war and its effects on both those serving in the military as well as the family members of soldiers.<ref name="seregilofrhiminee">{{cite web|url=http://www.risingshadow.net/articles/433-a-review-of-alexander-zelenyj-s-songs-for-the-lost|title=A review of Alexander Zelenyj's Songs for the Lost|author=Seregil of Rhiminee|work=risingshadow.net}}</ref> Zelenyj's stories have examined both World Wars, the [[Vietnam War]], colonial struggles in the American West, and Medieval-period conflict, among others. Religious themes resonate through his fiction, particularly in the stories of ''Songs For The Lost'', which depicts fringe spirituality in the form of organized [[Mass suicide|suicide cults]] and individuals seeking spiritual escape from the trauma of their lives.<ref name="seregilofrhiminee"/> Themes of [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|apocalypse and post-apocalypse]] recur in his fiction.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.ca/Experiments-Billion-Paperback-Alexander-Zelenyj/dp/0955526841|title=Experiments at 3 Billion A.M. (Paperback): Alexander Zelenyj, David Rix: 9780955526848: Books - Amazon.ca|work=amazon.ca}}</ref> The dark quality inherent in much of Zelenyj's work gives it an apocalyptic tone even in those stories not dealing explicitly with end of the world scenarios.

Zelenyj's prose style has been described as burnished and literary, drawing comparisons to the work of authors such as [[Ray Bradbury]], [[Richard Matheson]], and [[Gabriel García Márquez|Gabriel Garcia Marquez]], as well as more contemporary slipstream authors such as [[Michael Cisco]] and [[D.P. Watt]].<ref name="fright.com"/> Some of his recent work is more streamlined in nature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hardcoverradio.com/episode-17-windsor-author-walexander-zelenyj/|title=Episode 17: Piece of Mind (with Alexander Zelenyj)|work=Hardcover}}</ref>

Zelenyj's short story collections are known for their massive length, their merging of an eclectic variety of literary genres and styles, their often dark and melancholy subject matter, and for their thematic cohesion and inter-story links.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://midnightstreetco.ipage.com/18401.html|title=SONGS FOR THE LOST - Alexander Zelenyj|work=Midnight Street Press|access-date=2016-02-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528002958/http://midnightstreetco.ipage.com/18401.html|archive-date=2016-05-28|url-status=dead}}</ref>
