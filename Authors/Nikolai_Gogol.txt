Gogol was one of the first to use the techniques of [[surrealism]] and the [[grotesque]] in his works ("[[The Nose (Gogol short story)|The Nose]]", "[[Viy (story)|Viy]]", "[[The Overcoat]]", "[[Nevsky Prospekt (story)|Nevsky Prospekt]]").

Many writers and critics have recognized Gogol's huge influence on [[Russian literature|Russian]] and world literature. Gogol's influence was acknowledged by [[Mikhail Bulgakov]], [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], [[Ryūnosuke Akutagawa]], [[Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin]], [[Flannery O'Connor]], [[Franz Kafka]] and others.<ref>{{cite web| date = 1968| url  = http://www.hrono.ru/organ/rossiya/natur_scol.php|title = Natural School (Натуральная школа)| publisher  = Brief Literary Encyclopedia in 9 Volumes.

==Early life==
Gogol was born in the [[Ukraine| Ukrainian]] [[Cossacks|Cossack]] town of [[Velyki Sorochyntsi|Sorochyntsi]],<ref name="brittanica">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Nikolay Gogol|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/237143/Nikolay-Vasilyevich-Gogol|access-date=31 December 2010|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}</ref> in the [[Poltava Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]]. His mother was descended from Leonty Kosyarovsky, an officer of the [[Lubny Regiment]] in 1710. His father [[Vasily Gogol-Yanovsky]], who died when Gogol was 15 years old, was a descendant of Ukrainian Cossacks (see [[Lyzohub family]]) and belonged to the 'petty gentry'. He wrote poetry in Ukrainian and Russian, and was an amateur [[Ukrainian-language]] playwright. As was typical of the left-bank Ukrainian gentry of the early nineteenth century, the family spoke Ukrainian as well as Russian. As a child, Gogol helped stage Ukrainian-language plays in his uncle's home theater.<ref name="Bojanowska">{{Cite book|last=Bojanowska|first=Edyta M.|title=Nikolai Gogol: Between Ukrainian and Russian Nationalism|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780674022911|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=78–88}}</ref>

In 1820, Gogol went to a school of higher art in [[Nizhyn]] (now [[Nizhyn Gogol State University]]) and remained there until 1828. It was there that he began writing. He was not popular among his schoolmates, who called him their "mysterious dwarf", but with two or three of them he formed lasting friendships. Very early he developed a dark and secretive disposition, marked by a painful self-consciousness and boundless ambition. Equally early he developed a talent for mimicry, which later made him a matchless reader of his own works and induced him to toy with the idea of becoming an actor.

On leaving school in 1828, Gogol went to [[Saint Petersburg]], full of vague but ambitious hopes. He desired literary fame, and brought with him a [[Romantic era|Romantic]] poem of German idyllic life – ''Hans Küchelgarten'', and had it published at his own expense, under the pseudonym "V. Alov." The magazines he sent it to almost universally derided it. He bought all the copies and destroyed them, swearing never to write poetry again.

==Literary development==
[[Image:Nikolai Gogol - Revizor cover (1836).jpg|upright|thumb|Cover of the first edition of ''[[The Government Inspector]]'' (1836).]]

In 1831, the first volume of Gogol's Ukrainian stories (''[[Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka]]'') was published, and met with immediate success.<ref>Krys Svitlana, ''“Allusions to Hoffmann in Gogol’s Ukrainian Horror Stories from the Dikan'ka Collection.”'' Canadian Slavonic Papers: Special Issue, devoted to the 200th anniversary of Nikolai Gogol'’s birth (1809–1852) 51.2–3 (June–September 2009): 243–266.</ref> A second volume was published in 1832, followed by two volumes of stories entitled ''[[Mirgorod (Gogol)|Mirgorod]]'' in 1835, and two volumes of miscellaneous prose entitled ''Arabesques''. At this time, Russian editors and critics such as [[Nikolai Polevoy]] and [[Nikolai Nadezhdin]] saw Gogol as a Ukrainian, rather than Russian, writer, and used his works to illustrate the differences between Russian and Ukrainian national characters.<ref name="Bojanowska-78">{{Cite book|last=Bojanowska|first=Edyta M.|title=Nikolai Gogol: Between Ukrainian and Russian Nationalism|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780674022911|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=78–88}}</ref> The themes and style of these early prose works by Gogol, as well as his later drama, were similar to the work of Ukrainian writers and dramatists who were his contemporaries and friends, including [[Hryhory Kvitka-Osnovyanenko]] and [[Vasily Narezhny]]. However, Gogol's satire was much more sophisticated and unconventional.<ref name="Peace2009">{{cite book|author=Richard Peace|title=The Enigma of Gogol: An Examination of the Writings of N.V. Gogol and Their Place in the Russian Literary Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=thki88thwNgC&pg=PA152|access-date=15 April 2012|date=30 April 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-11023-5|pages=151–152}}</ref>

At this time, Gogol developed a passion for Ukrainian history and tried to obtain an appointment to the history department at [[Kyiv University]]. Despite the support of Pushkin and [[Sergey Uvarov]], the Russian minister of education, the appointment was blocked by a [[Kyiv]]an [[bureaucracy|bureaucrat]] on the grounds that Gogol was unqualified.<ref name="Luckyj">{{cite book| author=Luckyj, G. | title=The Anguish of Mykola Ghoghol, a.k.a.

Luckyj}}</ref> His fictional story ''[[Taras Bulba]]'', based on the history of [[Zaporozhian Host|Ukrainian cossacks]], was the result of this phase in his interests. During this time, he also developed a close and lifelong friendship with another Ukrainian, the historian and naturalist [[Mykhaylo Maksymovych]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wumag.kiev.ua/index2.php?param=pgs20033/52 |title=Welcome to Ukraine |publisher=Wumag.kiev.ua |access-date=22 July 2013}}</ref>

In 1834, Gogol was made Professor of Medieval History at the [[University of St. Petersburg]], a job for which he had no qualifications. The academic venture proved a disaster:<blockquote>He turned in a performance ludicrous enough to warrant satiric treatment in one of his own stories. After an introductory lecture made up of brilliant generalizations which the 'historian' had prudently prepared and memorized, he gave up all pretence at erudition and teaching, missed two lectures out of three, and when he did appear, muttered unintelligibly through his teeth. At the final examination, he sat in utter silence with a black handkerchief wrapped around his head, simulating a toothache, while another professor interrogated the students.<ref name="comic-grotesque">{{cite book| author=Lindstrom, T. | title=A Concise History of Russian Literature Volume I from the Beginnings to Checkhov| location= New York | publisher= [[New York University Press]] | year = 1966 | page = 131|lccn=66-22218}}</ref></blockquote> Gogol resigned his chair in 1835.

[[Image:Nicolas Gogol.jpg|upright|thumb|Commemorative plaque on his house in Rome]]

Between 1832 and 1836, Gogol worked with great energy, and had extensive contact with Pushkin, but he still had not yet decided that his ambitions were to be fulfilled by success in literature. During this time, the Russian critics [[Stepan Shevyryov|Stepan Shevyrev]] and [[Vissarion Belinsky]], contradicting the earlier critics, reclassified Gogol from a Ukrainian to a Russian writer.<ref name = "Bojanowska-78"/> It was only after the presentation of his comedy ''[[The Government Inspector]]'' (''Revizor'') at the [[Saint Petersburg]] State Theatre, on 19 April 1836, <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.act-sf.org/content/dam/act/education_department/words_on_plays/The%20Government%20Inspector%20Words%20on%20Plays%20(2008).pdf|title=The Government Inspector|date=2008|website=American Conservative Theater}}</ref> that he finally came to believe in his literary vocation. The comedy, a violent satire of Russian provincial bureaucracy, was staged thanks only to the intervention of the emperor, [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]].

From 1836 to 1848, Gogol lived abroad, travelling through Germany and Switzerland. Gogol spent the winter of 1836–37 in [[Paris]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fr.rbth.com/art/2013/06/24/le_nom_de_nikolai_gogol_est_immortalise_a_la_place_de_la_bourse_a_paris_24311|title=Le nom de Nikolaï Gogol est immortalisé à la place de la Bourse à Paris|last=RBTH|date=2013-06-24|language=fr-FR|access-date=2016-08-30}}</ref> among Russian [[expatriate]]s and Polish [[exile]]s, frequently meeting the Polish poets [[Adam Mickiewicz]] and [[Józef Bohdan Zaleski|Bohdan Zaleski]]. He eventually settled in [[Rome]]. For much of the twelve years from 1836, Gogol was in Italy, where he developed an adoration for Rome. He studied art, read Italian literature and developed a passion for opera.

[[Alexander Pushkin|Pushkin]]'s death produced a strong impression on Gogol. His principal work during the years following Pushkin's death was the satirical epic ''Dead Souls''. Concurrently, he worked at other tasks – recast ''[[Taras Bulba]]'' (1842)<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ilnytzkyj |first1=Oleh S. |title=Is Gogol's 1842 Version of Taras Bul'ba really 'Russified'? |journal=Journal of Ukrainian Studies |date=2010–2011 |volume=35-36 |pages=51–68}}</ref> and ''[[The Portrait (short story)|The Portrait]]'', completed his second comedy, ''[[Marriage (play)|Marriage]]'' (''Zhenitba''), wrote the fragment ''[[Rome (Gogol)|Rome]]'' and his most famous short story, "[[The Overcoat]]".

In 1841, the first part of ''[[Dead Souls]]'' was ready, and Gogol took it to Russia to supervise its printing. It appeared in [[Moscow]] in 1842, under a new title imposed by the censorship, ''The Adventures of Chichikov''. The book established his reputation as one of the greatest prose writers in the language.

==Creative decline and death==
[[File:Gogol Portrait.jpg|upright|thumb|One of several portraits of Gogol by [[Fyodor Moller]] (1840)]]
After the triumph of ''Dead Souls'', Gogol's contemporaries came to regard him as a great satirist who lampooned the unseemly sides of Imperial Russia. They did not know that ''Dead Souls'' was but the first part of a planned modern-day counterpart to the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} The first part represented the ''Inferno''; the second part would depict the gradual purification and transformation of the rogue Chichikov under the influence of virtuous publicans and governors – ''[[Purgatory]]''.<ref>Gogol declared that "the subject of ''Dead Souls'' has nothing to do with the description of Russian provincial life or of a few revolting landowners. It is for the time being a secret which must suddenly and to the amazement of everyone (for as yet none of my readers has guessed it) be revealed in the following volumes..."</ref>

In April 1848, Gogol returned to Russia from a pilgrimage to [[Jerusalem]] and passed his last years in restless movement throughout the country. While visiting the capitals, he stayed with friends such as [[Mikhail Pogodin]] and [[Sergey Aksakov]]. During this period, he also spent much time with his old Ukrainian friends, [[Mykhaylo Maksymovych|Maksymovych]] and [[Osyp Bodiansky]].<!--The hilarious detail is out of place in this part of Gogol's biography, which was a continuous nightmare: Describing Gogol's 41st birthday celebration, [[Sergey Aksakov]] wrote that "the three Ukrainians were charming. They sang without the music and Gogol read to me some [[Duma (epic)|dumy]] of the Ukrainian [[Homer]]." --> He intensified his relationship with a [[starets]] or spiritual elder, Matvey Konstantinovsky, whom he had known for several years. Konstantinovsky seems to have strengthened in Gogol the fear of perdition (damnation) by insisting on the sinfulness of all his imaginative work. Exaggerated ascetic practices undermined his health and he fell into a state of deep depression. On the night of 24 February 1852 he burned some of his manuscripts, which contained most of the second part of ''Dead Souls''. He explained this as a mistake, a practical joke played on him by the [[Satan|Devil]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Soon thereafter, he took to bed, refused all food, and died in great pain nine days later.

Gogol was mourned in the Saint Tatiana church at the Moscow University before his burial and then buried at the [[Danilov Monastery]], close to his fellow [[Slavophile]] [[Aleksey Khomyakov]]. His grave was marked by a large stone (Golgotha), topped by a Russian Orthodox cross.<ref>[http://www.newsru.com/cinema/29dec2009/gogole.html Могиле Гоголя вернули первозданный вид: на нее поставили "Голгофу" с могилы Булгакова и восстановили крест.]{{in lang|ru}}</ref>

[[File:Post-2009 gravesite of Nikolai Gogol in Novodevichy Cemetery, Moscow, Russia.jpg|thumb|Post-2009 gravesite of Nikolai Gogol in Novodevichy Cemetery, Moscow, Russia]]

In 1931, Moscow authorities decided to demolish the monastery and had Gogol's remains transferred to the [[Novodevichy Cemetery]].<ref name=pass>{{cite news|title=Novodevichy Cemetery|url=http://www.passportmagazine.ru/article/1099/|access-date=12 September 2013|work=Passport Magazine|date=April 2008}}</ref> His body was discovered lying face down, which gave rise to the story that Gogol had been buried alive. The authorities moved the Golgotha stone to the new gravesite, but removed the cross; in 1952 the Soviets replaced the stone with a bust of Gogol. The stone was later reused for the tomb of Gogol's admirer [[Mikhail Bulgakov]].  In 2009, in connection with the bicentennial of Gogol's birth, the bust was moved to the museum at Novodevichy Cemetery, and the original Golgotha stone was returned, along with a copy of the original Orthodox cross.<ref>[http://www.newsru.com/cinema/29dec2009/gogole.html Могиле Гоголя вернули первозданный вид: на нее поставили "Голгофу" с могилы Булгакова и восстановили крест.]{{in lang|ru}} Retrieved 23 September 2013</ref>

The first Gogol monument in Moscow, a [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] statue on [[Arbatskaya Square|Arbat Square]], represented the sculptor [[Nikolay Andreyev]]'s idea of Gogol rather than the real man.<ref>[http://www.artclassic.edu.ru/attach.asp?a_no=9444 Российское образование.

[[Image:Korobochka.jpg|thumb|Among the illustrators of ''Dead Souls'' was [[Pyotr Sokolov (painter)|Pyotr Sokolov]].]]
[[D. S. Mirsky]] characterizes Gogol's universe as "one of the most marvellous, unexpected – in the strictest sense, original<ref>This does not mean that numerous influences cannot be discerned in his work. The principle of these are: the tradition of the Ukrainian folk and [[puppet theatre]], with which the plays of Gogol's father were closely linked; the heroic poetry of the Cossack ballads (''[[Duma (epic)|dumy]]''), the ''[[Iliad]]'' in the Russian version by [[Nikolay Gnedich|Gnedich]]; the numerous and mixed traditions of comic writing from [[Molière]] to the vaudevillians of the 1820s; the [[picaresque novel]] from [[Alain-René Lesage|Lesage]] to [[Vasily Narezhny|Narezhny]]; [[Laurence Sterne|Sterne]], chiefly through the medium of German romanticism; the German romanticists themselves (especially [[Ludwig Tieck|Tieck]] and [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]]); the French tradition of [[Gothic romance]] – a long and yet incomplete list.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}</ref> – worlds ever created by an artist of words".<ref>[[D.S. Mirsky]]. ''A History of Russian Literature''. [[Northwestern University Press]], 1999. {{ISBN|0-8101-1679-0}}. p. 155.</ref>

A characteristic of Gogol's writing is his 'impressionist' vision of reality and people.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} He saw the outer world strangely metamorphosed, a singular gift particularly evident from the fantastic spatial transformations in his Gothic stories, "[[A Terrible Vengeance]]" and "[[A Bewitched Place]]". His pictures of nature are strange mounds of detail heaped on detail, resulting in an unconnected chaos of things: "His people are caricatures, drawn with the method of the caricaturist – which is to exaggerate salient features and to reduce them to geometrical pattern. But these cartoons have a convincingness, a truthfulness, and inevitability – attained as a rule by slight but definitive strokes of unexpected reality – that seems to beggar the visible world itself."<ref>Mirsky, p. 191</ref> According to [[Andrey Bely]], Gogol's work influenced the emergence of [[Gothic romance]], and served as a forerunner for [[Literary nonsense|absurdism]] and [[impressionism]].<ref>{{Cite book|language=ru|author=Andrey Bely

|publisher=Ogiz|location=Leningrad|date=1934|url=http://gogol-lit.ru/gogol/kritika/belyj-masterstvo-gogolya/index.htm}}</ref>

The aspect under which the mature Gogol sees reality is expressed by the Russian word ''[[poshlost']]'', which means something similar to "triviality, banality, inferiority", moral and spiritual, widespread in some group or society. Like [[Laurence Sterne|Sterne]] before him, Gogol was a great destroyer of prohibitions and of romantic illusions. He undermined Russian Romanticism by making vulgarity reign where only the sublime and the beautiful had before.<ref>
According to some critics{{which|date=June 2015}}, Gogol's grotesque is a "means of estranging, a comic hyperbole that unmasks the banality and inhumanity of ambient reality". See: Fusso, Susanne. ''Essays on Gogol: Logos and the Russian Word''. Northwestern University Press, 1994. {{ISBN|0-8101-1191-8}}. p. 55.</ref> "Characteristic of Gogol is a sense of boundless superfluity that is soon revealed as utter emptiness and a rich comedy that suddenly turns into metaphysical horror."<ref>"Russian literature." [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], 2005.

His stories often interweave pathos and mockery, while "[[The Tale of How Ivan Ivanovich Quarreled with Ivan Nikiforovich]]" begins as a merry farce and ends with the famous dictum, "It is dull in this world, gentlemen!"

It stunned Gogol when critics interpreted ''[[The Government Inspector]]'' as an indictment of [[tsarism]] despite Nicholas I's patronage of the play. Gogol himself, an adherent of the [[Slavophile]] movement, believed in a divinely inspired mission for both the [[House of Romanov]] and the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. Like [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], Gogol sharply disagreed with those Russians who preached [[constitutional monarchy]] and the disestablishment of the Orthodox Church.

After defending [[autocracy]], [[serfdom]], and the Orthodox Church in his book ''Selected Passages from Correspondence with his Friends'' (1847), Gogol came under attack from his former patron [[Vissarion Belinsky]]. The first Russian intellectual to publicly preach the economic theories of [[Karl Marx]], Belinsky accused Gogol of betraying his readership by defending the ''status quo''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/subject/art/lit_crit/works/belinsky/gogol.htm |title=Letter to N.V. Gogol |publisher=marxists.org |date=February 2008 |access-date=12 December 2017}}</ref>

==Influence and interpretations==
Even before the publication of ''Dead Souls'', Belinsky recognized Gogol as the first Russian-language realist writer and as the head of the [[Natural School]], to which he also assigned such younger or lesser authors as [[Ivan Goncharov|Goncharov]], [[Ivan Turgenev|Turgenev]], [[Dmitry Grigorovich]], [[Vladimir Dahl]] and [[Vladimir Sollogub]]. Gogol himself appeared skeptical about the existence of such a literary movement. Although he recognized "several young writers" who "have shown a particular desire to observe real life", he upbraided the deficient composition and style of their works.<ref>"The structure of the stories themselves seemed especially unskilful and clumsy to me; in one story I noted excess and verbosity, and an absence of simplicity in the style". Quoted by Vasily Gippius in his monograph ''Gogol'' ([[Duke University Press]], 1989, p. 166).</ref> Nevertheless, subsequent generations of radical critics celebrated Gogol (the author in whose world a nose roams the streets of the Russian capital) as a great realist, a reputation decried by the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' as "the triumph of Gogolesque irony".<ref>The latest edition{{which|date=December 2018}} of the Britannica labels Gogol "one of the finest comic authors of world literature and perhaps its most accomplished [[nonsense]] writer." See under "Russian literature."{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}</ref>

The period of literary [[modernism]] saw a revival of interest in and a change of attitude towards Gogol's work. One of the pioneering works of [[Russian formalism]] was [[Boris Eichenbaum|Eichenbaum]]'s reappraisal of "The Overcoat". In the 1920s a group of Russian short-story writers, known as the [[Serapion Brothers]], placed Gogol among their precursors and consciously sought to imitate his techniques. The leading novelists of the period – notably [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]] and [[Mikhail Bulgakov]] – also admired Gogol and followed in his footsteps. In 1926 [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]] staged ''[[The Government Inspector]]'' as a "comedy of the absurd situation", revealing to his fascinated spectators a corrupt world of endless self-deception. In 1934 [[Andrei Bely]] published the most meticulous study of Gogol's literary techniques up to that date, in which he analyzed the colours prevalent in Gogol's work depending on the period, his impressionistic use of verbs, the expressive discontinuity of his syntax, the complicated rhythmical patterns of his sentences, and many other secrets of his craft. Based on this work, [[Vladimir Nabokov]] published a summary account of Gogol's masterpieces.<ref>Nabokov, Vladimir (2017) [1961]. Nikolai Gogol. New York: New Directions. p. 140. {{ISBN|0-8112-0120-1}}</ref>
[[Image:Gogol house.jpg|thumb|right|The house in Moscow where Gogol died. The building contains the fireplace where he burned the manuscript of the second part of ''[[Dead Souls]]''.]]

Gogol's impact on Russian literature has endured, yet various critics have appreciated his works differently. [[Vissarion Belinsky|Belinsky]], for instance, berated his horror stories as "moribund, monstrous works", while [[Andrei Bely]] counted them among his most stylistically daring creations. Nabokov especially admired ''Dead Souls'', ''The Government Inspector'', and "[[The Overcoat]]" as works of genius, proclaiming that "when, as in his immortal 'The Overcoat', Gogol really let himself go and pottered happily on the brink of his private abyss, he became the greatest artist that Russia has yet produced."<ref>{{cite book|last= Nabokov|first= Vladimir|title= Nikolai Gogol|orig-year= 1961|publisher= New Directions|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-8112-0120-9|page= 140 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pt64DgAAQBAJ | year = 2017}}</ref> Critics traditionally interpreted "The Overcoat" as a masterpiece of "humanitarian realism", but Nabokov and some other attentive readers argued that "holes in the language" make the story susceptible to interpretation as a supernatural tale about a ghostly double of a "small man".<ref>Dostoevsky appears to have had such a reading of the story in mind when he wrote [[The Double: A Petersburg Poem|''The Double'']]. The quote, often apocryphally attributed to Dostoevsky, that "we all [future generations of Russian novelists] emerged from Gogol's ''Overcoat''", actually refers to those few who read "The Overcoat" as a ghost story (as did [[Aleksey Remizov]], judging by his story ''The Sacrifice'').</ref> Of all Gogol's stories, [[The Nose (Gogol)|"The Nose"]] has stubbornly defied all abstruse interpretations: [[D.S. Mirsky]] declared it "a piece of sheer play, almost sheer nonsense". In recent years, however, "The Nose" became the subject of several postmodernist and postcolonial interpretations.

Some critics have paid attention to the apparent [[anti-Semitism]] in Gogol's writings, as well as in those of his contemporary, [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]].<ref>Vladim Joseph Rossman, Vadim Rossman, Vidal Sassoon. ''Russian Intellectual Antisemitism in the Post-Communist Era.'' p. 64. [[University of Nebraska Press]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=pF-I25OC5ugC&pg=PA64&lpg=PA64&dq=Nikolai+Gogol+and+anti-Semitism&source=web&ots=mVUR5K8xjY&sig=JWA4rHXJKYTEWlhorxU5wd0MJYw&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=6&ct=result Google.com]</ref> Felix Dreizin and David Guaspari, for example, in their ''The Russian Soul and the Jew: Essays in Literary Ethnocentrism'', discuss "the significance of the Jewish characters and the negative image of the Ukrainian Jewish community in Gogol's novel ''Taras Bulba'', pointing out Gogol's attachment to anti-Jewish prejudices prevalent in Russian and Ukrainian culture."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://sicsa.huji.ac.il/demtext2.html |title= Antisemitism in Literature and in the Arts |publisher= Sicsa.huji.ac.il |access-date= 22 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130926150625/http://sicsa.huji.ac.il/demtext2.html |archive-date= 26 September 2013 |df= dmy-all }}</ref> In [[Léon Poliakov]]'s ''The History of Antisemitism'', the author mentions that<blockquote> "The 'Yankel' from ''Taras Bulba'' indeed became the archetypal Jew in Russian literature. Gogol painted him as supremely exploitative, cowardly, and repulsive, albeit capable of gratitude. But it seems perfectly natural in the story that he and his cohorts be drowned in the [[Dnieper|Dniper]] by the Cossack lords. Above all, Yankel is ridiculous, and the image of the plucked chicken that Gogol used has made the rounds of great Russian authors."<ref>Léon Poliakov. ''The History of Antisemitism.'' p. 75. [[University of Pennsylvania Press]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=94H61cGGGQ8C&pg=PA75&lpg=PA75&dq=Nikolai+Gogol+and+anti-Semitism&source=web&ots=QZrpeuCWhi&sig=KDrHHQSbL8YYlbINJ30bWDxp6wM&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result Google.com]</ref></blockquote>

Despite his portrayal of Jewish characters, Gogol left a powerful impression even on Jewish writers who inherited his literary legacy. Amelia Glaser has noted the influence of Gogol's literary innovations on [[Sholem Aleichem]], who <blockquote>
"chose to model much of his writing, and even his appearance, on Gogol... What Sholem Aleichem was borrowing from Gogol was a rural East European landscape that may have been dangerous, but could unite readers through the power of collective memory. He also learned from Gogol to soften this danger through laughter, and he often rewrites Gogol's Jewish characters, correcting anti-Semitic stereotypes and narrating history from a Jewish perspective."<ref>Amelia Glaser. "Sholem Aleichem, Gogol Show Two Views of Shtetl Jews." [[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles|The Jewish Journal]], 2009.

===In music and film===
Gogol's oeuvre has also had an impact on Russia's non-literary culture, and his stories have been [[Bibliography of Nikolai Gogol#Adaptations|adapted numerous times]] into opera and film. The Russian composer [[Alfred Schnittke]] wrote the eight-part ''Gogol Suite'' as [[incidental music]] to ''[[The Government Inspector#Other adaptations|The Government Inspector]]'' performed as a [[play (theater)|play]], and [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] set [[The Nose (opera)|''The Nose'']] as his first opera in 1928 – a peculiar choice of subject for what was meant to initiate the great tradition of Soviet opera.<ref>[http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/1045867/a/Schnittke:+Gogol+Suite,+Labyrinths+%2F+Lev+Markiz,+Malm%F6+Sym.htm Gogol Suite], CD Universe</ref> More recently, to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Gogol's birth in 1809, Vienna's renowned [[Theater an der Wien]] commissioned music and libretto for a full-length opera on the life of Gogol from Russian composer and writer [[Lera Auerbach]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://wien.orf.at/stories/262439/|title= Zwei Kompositionsaufträge vergeben|trans-title= Two Compositions Commissioned|language= de|work= wien.orf.at|url-status=unfit|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110725175353/http://wien.orf.at/stories/262439/|archive-date= 25 July 2011}} [https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=auto&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwayback.archive.org%2Fweb%2F20110725175353%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fwien.orf.at%2Fstories%2F262439%2F Alt URL]</ref>

More than 135 films<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0324690/?ref_=ttfc_fc_wr3|title=Nikolai Gogol|work=IMDb}}</ref> have been based on Gogol's work, the most recent being ''[[The Girl in the White Coat]]'' (2011).

Gogol is mentioned several times in [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s ''[[Poor Folk]]'' and ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' and [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]]'s ''[[The Seagull]]''.
==Adaptations==
[[BBC Radio 4]] made a series of six Gogol short stories, entitled ''Three Ivans, Two Aunts and an Overcoat'' (2002, adaptations by Jim Poyser) starring [[Griff Rhys-Jones]] and [[Stephen Moore (actor)|Stephen Moore]]. The stories adapted were "[[The Tale of How Ivan Ivanovich Quarreled with Ivan Nikiforovich|The Two Ivans]]", "[[The Overcoat]]", "[[Ivan Fyodorovich Shponka and His Aunt]]", "[[The Nose (Gogol)|The Nose]]", "[[The Portrait (Gogol short story)|The Mysterious Portrait]]" and "[[Diary of a Madman (short story)|Diary of a Madman]]".

Gogol's short story "Christmas Eve"  was adapted into operatic form twice by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], first as ''[[Vakula the Smith]]'' in 1874, then as ''[[Cherevichki|The Tsarina's Slippers]]'' in 1885; [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]] also wrote [[Christmas Eve (opera)|an opera based on the same story]] in 1894. The story was also adapted for radio by [[Adam Beeson]] and broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 24 December 2008<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00g3cfq |title=Christmas Eve |publisher=BBC Radio 4 |date=24 December 2008 |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110204616/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00g3cfq |archive-date=10 January 2009}}</ref> and subsequently rebroadcast on both Radio 4 and [[BBC Radio 4 Extra|Radio 4 Extra]] on Christmas Eve 2010, 2011 and 2015;<ref>{{cite web|first=Nikolai |last=Gogol |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00wsymb |title=Nikolai Gogol – Christmas Eve |publisher=BBC Radio 4 Extra |date=24 December 2015 |access-date=24 August 2016}}</ref>

The short story "Christmas Eve" was also adapted into a film in 1961 entitled [[The Night Before Christmas (1961 film)|The Night Before Christmas]].

Gogol's story "Viy"  was adapted into film by Russian filmmakers four times: the original ''[[Viy (1967 film)|Viy]]'' in 1967; the horror film ''Vedma'' (aka ''The Power of Fear'') in 2006; the action-horror film ''[[Viy (2014 film)|Viy]]'' in 2014; and the horror film ''Gogol Viy'' released in 2018. It was also adapted into the Russian [[Full motion video|FMV]] video game ''Viy: The Story Retold'' (2004). Outside of Russia, the film loosely served as the inspiration for [[Mario Bava]]'s film ''[[Black Sunday (1960 film)|Black Sunday]]'' (1960) and the South Korean horror film ''Evil Spirit: Viy'' (2008).

Gogol's short story "The Portrait" is being made into a feature film ''[[The Portrait (upcoming film)|The Portrait]]'' by fine artists Anastasia Elena Baranoff and Elena Vladimir Baranoff.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.screendaily.com/news/patrick-cassavetti-boards-lenin/5073427.article|title=Patrick Cassavetti boards Lenin?!}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.russianartandculture.com/news-gogols-short-story-the-portrait-to-be-made-into-feature-film/|title=Gogol's short story The Portrait to be made into feature film|publisher=russianartandculture.com|date=4 July 2014|access-date=24 August 2016}}</ref><ref>Screen International [http://www.screendaily.com/festivals/berlin/david-oakes-simon-callow-to-star-in-russian-period-drama-the-portrait/5100200.article],  Berlin Film Festival, 12 February 2016.</ref><ref>Russian Art and Culture [http://www.russianartandculture.com/news-gogols-the-portrait-adapted-for-the-screen-by-an-international-team-of-talents/ “Gogol’s “The Portrait” adapted for the screen by an international team of talents”], London, 29 January 2016.</ref><ref>Kinodata.Pro [http://kinodata.pro/vse-o-kino/novosti-rus-kino/11597-zvezda-doma-solnca-sygraet-v-ekranizacii-rasskaza-gogolya-portret.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190503171257/http://kinodata.pro/vse-o-kino/novosti-rus-kino/11597-zvezda-doma-solnca-sygraet-v-ekranizacii-rasskaza-gogolya-portret.html |date=3 May 2019 }} Russia, 12 February 2016.</ref><ref>Britshow.com [http://britshow.com/index.php/russian-news/1938-britantsy-snimutsya-v-ekranizatsii-gogolya] 16 February 2016.</ref>

The Russian TV-3 television series ''Gogol'' features Nikolai Gogol as a lead character and presents a fictionalized version of his life that mixes his history with elements from his various stories.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2017/09/05/732340-serial-o-gogole|newspaper=[[Vedomosti]]|title=Сериал о Гоголе собрал за первые выходные в четыре раза больше своего бюджета}}</ref> The episodes were also released theatrically starting with ''[[Gogol. The Beginning]]'' in August 2017. A sequel entitled ''[[Gogol. Viy|Gogol: Viy]]'' was released in April 2018 and the third film ''[[Gogol. Terrible Revenge|Gogol: Terrible Revenge]]'' debuted in August 2018.

In 1963 an animated version of Gogol's classic surrealist story "The Nose" was made by [[Alexandre Alexeieff and Claire Parker]], using the [[pinscreen animation]] technique, for the National Film Board of Canada.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nowell-Smith |first1=Geoffrey (ed) |title=The Oxford History of World Cinema |year=1996 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=274 |isbn=978-0-19-874242-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MZwVDAAAQBAJ&dq=gogol%27s+the+nose+1963+animation+canada&pg=PA274 |access-date=13 November 2021}}</ref>

A definitive animated movie adaptation of Gogol's ''[[The Nose (Gogol short story)|The Nose]]'' released in January 2020.
