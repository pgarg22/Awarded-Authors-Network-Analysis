'''Joy Chant''' (born 13 January 1945) is a British [[fantasy]] writer. She is best known for the three House of Kendreth novels, published 1970 to 1983. Her legal name is '''Eileen Joyce Rutter'''.<ref name=isfdb/>

==Biography==
Eileen Joyce ([[nickname]], "Joy") Chant was born in [[London]].<ref name=isfdb/>  She began writing in her early teens, and began publishing fiction while working as a Schools Librarian in London.<ref>{{cite book |last= Chant |first= Joy |title= Red Moon and Black Mountain |location= New York |publisher= E.P. Dutton |year= 1976 |page= dust jacket |ISBN=0-525-38193-7}}</ref> She attended college in Wales, where her father had been stationed during [[World War II]].<ref name= "thompson" /> Later, she lived with her husband and children in [[Leigh-on-Sea]], [[Essex]].<ref name= "thompson" />

==Works==
Chant's first novel was ''[[Red Moon and Black Mountain]]'', a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel world]] fiction. According to the author, it was based on elaborate fantasy legends and imaginary games she began enacting and writing as a young child. After learning to read at two and a half, she mostly read folklore and mythology, not knowing of adult fantasy until she was twenty.<ref name="voiha">Joy Chant, afterword to ''When Voiha Wakes'' (Ballantine, 1983).</ref> As for Vandarei:

"... it began as a playworld, the sort that a lot of children have, and I was of course the Queen, the character about whom I created the adventures. But I had the disposition of a pedant. I didn't really want to pretend:  I wanted to know, to be sure, to get it right. So even in its childish form this [[paracosm|playworld]] tended to become concise, factual.  As I grew older, horses became a passion and the playworld developed into "Equitania"—the horse motif strengthening.  During this time the history of the country itself assumed an importance and I began to actually write. At fifteen, however, the last links with "Equitania" wavered and the name "Vandarei" appeared.  The Queen was abandoned and ceased to be an avatar of myself, becoming a character whom I manipulated, but with whom I no longer especially identified."<ref name="voiha"/>

''Red Moon and Black Mountain'' was published in the U.K. by [[George Allen & Unwin]] in 1970, and in the U.S. by [[Ballantine Books]] in 1971 as part of its celebrated [[Ballantine Adult Fantasy series]], with a cover illustration by Bob Pepper. The House of Kendreth series comprises ''Red Moon'' and two related books, ''The Grey Mane of Morning'' (1977) and ''When Voiha Wakes'' (1983), as well as a short story, "The Coming of the Starborn" (1983).<ref name=yates/>

Chant's other major work is ''The High Kings'' (1983), illustrated by George Sharp, designed by [[David Larkin]] and edited by [[Ian Ballantine|Ian]] and [[Betty Ballantine]]. It is a reference work on the [[King Arthur]] legends<ref name=thompson/> and the [[Matter of Britain]], incorporating retellings of the legends. She has also written numerous articles on fantasy fiction.
