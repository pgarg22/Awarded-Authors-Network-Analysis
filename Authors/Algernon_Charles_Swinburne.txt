'''Algernon Charles Swinburne''' (5 April 1837 – 10 April 1909) was an English poet, playwright, novelist, and critic. He wrote several novels and collections of poetry such as ''[[Poems and Ballads]]'', and contributed to the famous [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|Eleventh Edition]] of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.

Swinburne wrote about many [[taboo]] topics, such as lesbianism, [[cannibalism]], [[sado-masochism]], and [[anti-theism]]. His poems have many common motifs, such as the ocean, time, and death. Several historical people are featured in his poems, such as [[Sappho]] ("Sapphics"), [[Anactoria]] ("Anactoria"),  and [[Catullus]] ("To Catullus").<ref name=wa/>

Swinburne was born at 7 Chester Street, [[Grosvenor Place]], London, on 5 April 1837. He was the eldest of six children born to Captain (later Admiral) Charles Henry Swinburne (1797–1877) and Lady Jane Henrietta, daughter of the [[George Ashburnham, 3rd Earl of Ashburnham|3rd Earl of Ashburnham]], a wealthy [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbrian]] family. He grew up at East Dene in [[Bonchurch]] on the [[Isle of Wight]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poets/detail/algernon-charles-swinburne|title=Algernon Charles Swinburne|website=www.poetryfoundation.org|access-date=2016-05-03}}</ref> The Swinburnes also had a London home at Whitehall Gardens, Westminster.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cox |first1=Montagu H and Norman, Philip |title=No. 3 Whitehall Gardens Pages 204-207 Survey of London: Volume 13, St Margaret, Westminster, Part II: Whitehall I.

Swinburne spent summer holidays at [[Capheaton Hall]] in Northumberland, the house of his grandfather, [[Sir John Swinburne, 6th Baronet]] (1762–1860), who had a famous library and was president of the Literary and Philosophical Society in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. Swinburne considered Northumberland to be his native county, an emotion reflected in poems like the intensely patriotic "Northumberland", "[[Grace Darling]]" and others. He enjoyed riding his pony across the moors, he was a daring horseman, "through honeyed leagues of the northland border", as he called the Scottish border in his ''Recollections''.<ref name=de>{{Citation |last=Swinburne |first=Algernon |year=2013 | title=Delphi Complete Works of Algernon Charles Swinburne (Illustrated) |publisher=Delphi Classics |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5WYbAgAAQBAJ |access-date=4 December 2015 |isbn=9781909496699 }}</ref>

In the period 1857–60, Swinburne became a member of [[Pauline, Lady Trevelyan|Lady Trevelyan]]'s intellectual circle at [[Wallington Hall]].

After his grandfather's death in 1860 he stayed with [[William Bell Scott]] in Newcastle. In 1861, Swinburne visited [[Menton]] on the [[French Riviera]], staying at the Villa Laurenti to recover from the excessive use of alcohol.<ref name="Jones2007">{{cite book|author=Ted Jones|title=The French Riviera: A Literary Guide for Travellers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IeTGSDuFU6YC&pg=PA185|date=15 December 2007|publisher=Tauris Parke Paperbacks|isbn=978-1-84511-455-8|pages=185–}}</ref> From Menton, Swinburne travelled to Italy, where he journeyed extensively.<ref name="Jones2007"/> In December 1862, Swinburne accompanied Scott and his guests, probably including [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], on a trip to [[Tynemouth]]. Scott writes in his memoirs that, as they walked by the sea, Swinburne declaimed the as yet unpublished "[[Hymn to Proserpine]]" and "Laus Veneris" in his lilting intonation, while the waves "were running the whole length of the long level sands towards [[Cullercoats]] and sounding like far-off acclamations".<ref>{{Citation |last=Scott |first=William |year=1892 | title=Autobiographical Notes of the Life of William Bell Scott |publisher=Forgotten Books |location=London |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=makvAAAAIAAJ |access-date=4 December 2015 }}</ref>

At Oxford, Swinburne met several [[Pre-Raphaelites]], including Dante Gabriel Rossetti. He also met [[William Morris]]. After leaving college, he lived in London and started an active writing career, where Rossetti was delighted with his "little Northumbrian friend", probably a reference to Swinburne's diminutive height—he was just five-foot-four.<ref>Edmund Gosse, ''The Life of Algernon Swinburne'', 1917 (The Macmillan Company), p. 258, cited (w/ a Google-book link) at {{cite web |url=http://www.reelyredd.com/english-1208as-beforedawn.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-11-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512090821/http://www.reelyredd.com/english-1208as-beforedawn.htm |archive-date=12 May 2015}}.</ref>

Many critics consider his mastery of vocabulary, rhyme and [[Meter (poetry)|metre]] impressive,<ref name=kellett>{{cite book|last=Kellett|first=Ernest Edward|title=Reconsiderations: Literary Essays|date=1969|publisher=Books for Libraries Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0836913569|page=[https://archive.org/details/reconsiderations0000kell/page/227 227]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/reconsiderations0000kell/page/227}}</ref> although he has also been criticised for his florid style and word choices that only fit the rhyme scheme rather than contributing to the meaning of the piece.<ref>{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Edward|title=Algernon Charles Swinburne: A Critical Study|date=1912|publisher=M.

E. Housman]], a more measured and somewhat hostile critic, had great praise for his rhyming ability:

{{quote|[Swinburne] possessed an altogether unexampled command of rhyme, the chief enrichment of modern verse. The English language is comparatively poor in rhymes, and most English poets, when they have to rhyme more than two or three words together, betray their embarrassment. They betray it, for instance, when they write sonnets after the strict Petrarchian rule: the poetical inferiority of most English sonnets, if compared with what their own authors have achieved in other forms of verse, is largely though not entirely the result of this difficulty...To Swinburne the sonnet was child’s play: the task of providing four rhymes was not hard enough, and he wrote long poems in which each stanza required eight or ten rhymes, and wrote them so that he never seemed to be saying anything for the rhyme’s sake.<ref name=Housman>{{cite news | author=[[A.

Swinburne's work was once popular among undergraduates at Oxford and Cambridge, though today it has gone out of fashion. This is at least somewhat contextual, as it tends to mirror the popular and academic consensus regarding his work, although his ''Poems and Ballads, First Series'' and his ''Atalanta in Calydon'' never have been out of critical favour. ''Atalanta in Calydon'' in particular has been lauded as one of his best early works, written in 1865, before the passionate excesses of later works earned him a sordid reputation for blasphemy and depravity among contemporary critics.<ref name="Algernon Swinburne: The Critical Heritage">{{cite book|last=Hyder|first=Clyde|title=Algernon Swinburne: The Critical Heritage|year=1970|isbn=9780710066565|url=https://archive.org/details/swinburnecritica0000hyde|url-access=registration|access-date=6 October 2014}}</ref>  Pound praised his translations of Villon and valued his experiments with Greek measures (sapphics, hendecasyllabics), as did Bunting.

[[T.S. Eliot]] read Swinburne's essays on the Shakespearean and Jonsonian dramatists in ''The Contemporaries of Shakespeare'' and ''The Age of Shakespeare'' and Swinburne's books on Shakespeare and Jonson. Writing on Swinburne in ''The Sacred Wood: Essays on Poetry and Criticism'', Eliot wrote Swinburne had mastered his material, and "he is more reliable to them than [[William Hazlitt|Hazlitt]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], or [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Lamb]]: and his perception of relative values is almost always correct". However, Eliot judged Swinburne did not master it to the extent of being able to take liberties with it, which is everything.<ref>Eliot T.S. ''Reflections on Vers Libre'' New Statesman 1917</ref> Furthermore, Eliot disliked Swinburne's prose, about which he wrote "the tumultuous outcry of adjectives, the headstrong rush of undisciplined sentences, are the index to the impatience and perhaps laziness of a disorderly mind."<ref>{{cite book|last=Eliot|first=T. S.|title=The Sacred Wood and Major Early Essays|date=1998|publisher=Dover Publications| location=Mineola NY| isbn=978-0486299365|page=10}}</ref>

In France, Swinburne was highly praised by [[Stéphane Mallarmé]], and was invited to contribute to a book in honour of the poet [[Théophile Gautier]], ''Le tombeau de Théophile Gautier'' ([[wikisource:fr:Le Tombeau de Théophile Gautier/Texte entier|Wikisource]]): he answered by six poems in French, English, Latin and Greek.

He was considered by Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]] in 1892 for the role of [[poet laureate]]. He told Queen Victoria:
:I fear he is absolutely impossible. And I must own to have been astounded at the terms in which ''The Times'' (17th) described his early outrages. It is a sad pity : I have always been deeply impressed by his genius.<ref>[[Philip Guedalla]], ed.

Swinburne was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature every year from 1903 to 1907 and again in 1909.<ref name="nobellit">{{Cite web| url = https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=8936

Swinburne's poetic works include: ''[[Atalanta in Calydon]]'' (1865), ''[[Poems and Ballads]]'' (1866), ''[[Songs before Sunrise]]'' (1871), ''[[Poems and Ballads Second Series]]'', (1878) ''[[Tristram of Lyonesse]]'' (1882), ''[[Poems and Ballads Third Series]]'' (1889), and the novel ''[[Lesbia Brandon]]'' (published posthumously in 1952).

''[[Poems and Ballads]]'' caused a sensation when it was first published, especially the poems written in homage of [[Sappho of Lesbos]] such as "[[Anactoria]]" and "[[Sapphics]]": Moxon and Co. transferred its publication rights to [[John Camden Hotten]].<ref>Walter M. Kendrick, "The secret museum: pornography in modern culture", University of California Press, 1996, {{ISBN|0-520-20729-7}}, p.168</ref> Other poems in this volume such as "The Leper," "Laus Veneris," and "St Dorothy" evoke a Victorian fascination with the [[Middle Ages]], and are explicitly [[medieval (term)|mediaeval]] in style, tone and construction. Also featured in this volume are "[[Hymn to Proserpine]]", "[[The Triumph of Time]]" and "[[Dolores (Notre-Dame des Sept Douleurs)]]".

Swinburne devised the poetic form called the [[Roundel (poem)|roundel]], a variation of the French [[Rondeau (poetry)|Rondeau]] form, and some were included in ''A Century of Roundels'' dedicated to [[Christina Rossetti]].  Swinburne wrote to [[Edward Burne-Jones]] in 1883: "I have got a tiny new book of songs or songlets, in one form and all manner of metres ... just coming out, of which Miss Rossetti has accepted the dedication. I hope you and Georgie ''[his wife Georgiana, one of the [[MacDonald sisters]]]'' will find something to like among a hundred poems of nine lines each, twenty-four of which are about babies or small children". Opinions of these poems vary between those who find them captivating and brilliant, to those who find them merely clever and contrived.  One of them, ''A Baby's Death'', was set to music by the English composer [[Sir Edward Elgar]] as the song "[[Roundel: The little eyes that never knew Light]]". English composer [[Mary Augusta Wakefield]] set Swinburne's work ''May Time in Midwinter'' to music as well.

Swinburne was influenced by the work of [[William Shakespeare]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[Catullus]], [[William Morris]], [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], [[Robert Browning]], [[Alfred Lord Tennyson]], and [[Victor Hugo]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Maxwell |first=Catherine |year=2012| chapter=Algernon Charles Swinburne (1837–1909) |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |doi=10.1017/CCOL9780521895156.018 |title=The Cambridge Companion to the Pre-Raphaelites |pages=236–249 |isbn=9781139017183 |hdl=1880/43796 }}</ref> Swinburne was popular in England during his life, but his influence has greatly decreased since his death.

After the first ''Poems and Ballads'', Swinburne's later poetry increasingly was devoted to celebrations of [[republicanism]] and revolutionary causes, particularly in the volume ''[[Songs before Sunrise]]''.<ref name="wa" /> "A Song of Italy" is dedicated to Mazzini; "Ode on the Proclamation of the French Republic" is dedicated to Victor Hugo; and "Dirae" is a sonnet sequence of vituperative attacks against those whom Swinburne believed to be enemies of liberty. ''Erechtheus'' is the culmination of Swinburne's republican verse.<ref name="wa" />

He did not stop writing love poetry entirely, including his great epic-length poem ''Tristram of Lyonesse'', but its content is much less shocking than those of his earlier love poetry. His versification, and especially his rhyming technique, remain in top form to the end.<ref name="wa">{{Citation |last=Walsh |first=John |year=2012| title=An Introduction to Algernon Charles Swinburne |publisher=The Algernon Charles Swinburne Project |location=Bloomington |url= http://swinburnearchive.indiana.edu/swinburne/view#docId=swinburne/acs0000503-01.xml |access-date=4 December 2015 }}</ref>
