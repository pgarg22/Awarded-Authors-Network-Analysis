'''Linda Woolverton''' (born December 19, 1952) is an American screenwriter, playwright, and novelist, whose most prominent works include the screenplays and books of several acclaimed [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] films and stage musicals. She is the first woman to have written an animated feature for ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1991),<ref name="Linda LA">{{cite news |last=Dutka |first=Elaine |title=MOVIES: Ms. Beauty and the Beast |work=Los Angeles Times |date=January 19, 1992 |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-01-19-ca-544-story.html |access-date=May 30, 2014}}</ref> which is also the first animated film ever to be nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] at the [[64th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]]. She also co-wrote the screenplay of ''[[The Lion King]]'' (1994), provided additional story material for ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'' (1998), and adapted her own ''Beauty and the Beast'' screenplay into the book of the [[Beauty and the Beast (musical)|Broadway adaptation of the film]], for which she received a [[Tony Award]] nomination and won an [[Laurence Olivier Award|Olivier Award]].<ref name=Tony>{{cite news |url=https://apnews.com/article/d9e932debd3cea3ce9e43bd03731302c |title=List of 1994 Tony Award Nominations With AM-Tony Nominations |work=[[Associated Press]] |date=May 16, 1994 |access-date=December 10, 2020}}</ref><ref name=Olivier>{{cite web|title=OLIVIER AWARDS – Best Musicals Winners|url=http://www.westendtheatre.com/4668/awards-data/olivier-awards-best-musical-winners/|work=West End Theatre|access-date=May 25, 2014}}</ref>

Her recent work includes the screenplays for ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (2010) and ''[[Maleficent (film)|Maleficent]]'' (2014), both of which were significant box office successes.

==Early life and education==
Woolverton was born in 1952 in [[Long Beach, California]]. As a child, she began acting in the local children's theater as an escape from what she has described as a "traumatic childhood."<ref name="Linda LA" /> She graduated from high school in 1969 with honors in the school's theater program. She attended the [[California State University, Long Beach]], graduating with a BFA in Theater Arts in 1973. After the college graduation, she attended the [[California State University, Fullerton]], to receive a Master's degree in theater for children.<ref name="LionKingPressNotes">{{cite press release |title=The Lion King: Production Notes |url=https://www.lionking.org/text/FilmNotes.html |agency=Walt Disney Pictures |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026100715/http://www.lionking.org/text/FilmNotes.html |via=LionKing.org |date=May 25, 1994 |archive-date=October 26, 2008 |access-date=December 11, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>

==Career==
===First works===
Upon the completion of her master's degree, Woolverton formed her own children's theater company. She wrote, directed and performed all over California in churches, malls, schools, and local theaters. She also began to work as a creative drama instructor in 1979.<ref name="LionKingPressNotes" /> In 1980, she began working as a secretary for [[CBS]], where she eventually became a programming executive concentrating on both children's and late-night programming. During her lunch breaks, Woolverton wrote her first novel, the [[young adult fiction|young adult]] ''[[Star Wind]]''. After quitting her job in 1984 and starting working as a substitute teacher, she wrote her second novel, the also young adult ''[[Running Before the Wind]]''.<ref name="Journal bio">{{cite news |last=Woolard |first=John |title=Life is a fairy tale for Disney screenwriter Linda Woolverton |work=Star-Banner |page=2D |date=September 8, 1996 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&dat=19960908&id=PNFPAAAAIBAJ&pg=5622,3117667 |access-date=May 25, 2014 |via=[[Google News Archive]]}}</ref> Released in 1986 and 1987, respectively, both were published by [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton Mifflin]].

During this time, Woolverton began penning scripts for children's television shows. From 1986 to 1989, she wrote episodes for animated series as ''[[Star Wars: Ewoks]]'', ''[[Dennis the Menace (1986 TV series)|Dennis the Menace]]'', ''[[The Real Ghostbusters]]'', ''[[The Berenstain Bears (1985 TV series)|The Berenstain Bears]]'', ''[[My Little Pony (TV series)|My Little Pony]]'' and ''[[Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers (TV series)|Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers]]''.<ref name="LionKingPressNotes" /> After growing tired of writing for animated television shows, she expressed interest in working for [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|theatrical animation studio]], but was discouraged by her agent, who assessed that she "wasn't ready." Not agreeing with it, Woolverton went over to Disney offices in [[Burbank, California]], and dropped off a copy of ''Running Before the Wind'' to a secretary, asking her to "give it to somebody to read."<ref name="Journal bio" /> Two days later, she received a call from [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], then-Disney studio chairman, scheduling her for an interview.<ref name="Journal bio" /><ref name="Newport interview">{{cite web |last=Senger |first=Amy |title=2014 Newport Beach Film Festival: A Talk With 'Maleficent' Screenwriter Linda Woolverton |url=http://pacific-punch.com/2014-newport-beach-film-festival-a-talk-with-maleficent-screenwriter-linda-woolverton/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505014500/http://pacific-punch.com/2014-newport-beach-film-festival-a-talk-with-maleficent-screenwriter-linda-woolverton/ |url-status=dead |work=Pacific Punch |date=April 28, 2014 |access-date=May 25, 2014 |archive-date=May 5, 2014}}</ref>

===Works for Disney===
Woolverton was hired to write the script for [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney Feature Animation]]'s ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', thus becoming the first woman to write an animated feature for the studio.<ref name="Linda LA" /> From early 1985 to 1988, two different teams of writers had taken a turn at adapting [[Jeanne-Marie Le Prince de Beaumont]]'s [[Beauty and the Beast|tale]] into a feature film, but Woolverton succeeded by incorporating her own ideas into the story, such as making the protagonist a bookaholic. Upon its release in 1991, ''Beauty and the Beast'' received universal critical acclaim, becoming the first animated film ever to be nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]], and winning the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy]].

The success of ''Beauty and the Beast'' led Woolverton to work in several projects with Disney. She co-wrote the screenplay of the live-action film ''[[Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey]]'', released in 1993, and worked again with Disney Animation by helping the pre-production story development of ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', released in 1992, and co-writing the screenplay of ''[[The Lion King]]'', released in 1994. Both ''Aladdin'' and ''The Lion King'' were noted box office successes and received critical acclaim. During this time, she also adapted her own ''Beauty and the Beast'' screenplay into a [[Beauty and the Beast (musical)|Broadway musical]], which opened to critical acclaim in 1994, leading her to be nominated for a Tony Award for Best Book in a Musical and to win an Olivier Award for Best New Musical.<ref name="Tony" /><ref name="Olivier" /> She provided additional story material for ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'', released in 1998, and co-wrote the book of the stage musical ''[[Aida (musical)|Aida]]'', which opened on Broadway in 2000 to critical acclaim.

In 2007, she completed a screenplay where an older [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]], from [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', returns to [[Wonderland (fictional country)|Wonderland]], from an idea she had in her head for many years. She presented the screenplay to producers [[Suzanne Todd]], [[Jennifer Todd]], and [[Joe Roth]], who took it to Disney. The studio immediately accepted the project, attaching [[Tim Burton]] to direct.<ref name="Alice int">{{cite interview |interviewer=Geoff Boucher |subject=Linda Woolverton |title='Alice in Wonderland' screenwriter is ready for haters: 'It's audacious, what we've done' |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206175835/http://herocomplex.latimes.com/uncategorized/wonderland-screenwriter-is-ready-for-haterswn-path-its-audacious-what-weve-done/ |url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/uncategorized/wonderland-screenwriter-is-ready-for-haterswn-path-its-audacious-what-weve-done/ |url-status=dead |work=Hero Complex |archive-date=December 6, 2013 |access-date=May 25, 2014 |date=February 8, 2010}}</ref> Released in 2010, ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' earned more than $1 billion at the worldwide box office, making Woolverton the first female screenwriter with a sole writing credit on a [[List of highest-grossing films|film that grossed $1 billion dollars]].<ref name="Linda leading" />  

In 2010, Disney invited her to write the screenplay of ''[[Maleficent (film)|Maleficent]]'', a retelling of the animated film ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'' from the point of view of [[Maleficent|the titular villain]]. As with ''Beauty and the Beast'', the film had been in [[development hell]] until Woolverton was attached to write it. She later described her version of the tale as a complete "reinvention, not just the retelling of the same story."<ref name="Linda Maleficent">{{cite news |last=Kang |first=Inkoo |title=Angelina Jolie and Linda Woolverton Talk Maleficent in New Featurette |url=https://womenandhollywood.com/angelina-jolie-and-linda-woolverton-talk-maleficent-in-new-featurette-ca5a19ea3efc/ |work=Women and Hollywood |date=April 24, 2014 |access-date=May 25, 2014}}</ref> ''Maleficent'' was released in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Maison|first=Jordan|date=2012-04-09|title=Disney Sets Release Date for Maleficent|url=https://www.cinelinx.com/movie-news/disney-sets-release-date-for-maleficent/|access-date=2021-06-27|website=Cinelinx {{!}} Movies.

===Other works===
Woolverton wrote the book of the Broadway musical ''[[Lestat (musical)|Lestat]]'', an adaptation of ''[[The Vampire Chronicles]]'' by [[Anne Rice]], which pre-debuted in 2005 in San Francisco to become the highest-earning pre-Broadway play in the city's history. The musical opened on Broadway in 2006. She co-wrote the narration script of the [[National Geographic Society#National Geographic Films|National Geographic]] theatrical documentary film ''[[Arctic Tale]]'', released in 2007.

They look at the world in interesting ways, maybe another way than the culture does. That makes a strong woman if she’s vocal about it, or even goes about trying to make change without being vocal about it. There are so many interesting ways to describe women besides just strong, even this pure difficult strength. It's strong-''willed''."

Belle is an intelligent and strong young woman, a Disney heroine who does "something other than wait for her prince to come."<ref name="Linda LA" /> ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' hailed Belle as "a [[Feminism|feminist]] heroine who [is] more rounded than previous Disney characters."<ref name="Empire Belle">{{cite web |last=Cochrane |first=Emma |title=Beauty And The Beast |url=https://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?DVDID=118543 |work=Empire |access-date=March 27, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012064142/http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?DVDID=118543 |archive-date=October 12, 2013}}</ref> Woolverton herself said that Belle "moved us forward a few inches.

She was a proactive character."<ref name=LindaWH>{{cite web |last1=Silverstein |first1=Melissa |title=Makers Presents 'Women in Hollywood'; 'Maleficent' Screenwriter Linda Woolverton on What's Changed and What Hasn't |url=https://womenandhollywood.com/makers-presents-women-in-hollywood-maleficent-screenwriter-linda-woolverton-on-what-s-changed-and-233419c089e5/|work=Women and Hollywood |date=October 7, 2014 |access-date=August 23, 2015}}</ref>

In ''Alice in Wonderland'', she gave the protagonist Alice Kingsleigh an adventurous, inquisitive, nonconforming personality, which leads the character to question the [[Victorian morality|values of the Victorian society]], and ultimately dismantle an engagement to become a world explorer. For this, ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'' said: "In her version of Wonderland, she [Woolverton] gave audiences a female character that was not dependent on a man for happiness or commercial success."<ref name="Linda leading" /> Describing her work in the film, Woolverton said: "My whole point in Alice was that you have to forge your own path. You can't go down anybody else's [road]. It's your dream; it's your life. You don't have to be told by other people what to make of yourself. You decide."<ref name="LindaWH" />

Reflecting on her female characters, Woolverton said: "I came up as a feminist, in my day. And when I was first approached to do ''Beauty and the Beast'', I knew that you couldn’t do a throwback Disney victim/heroine. We weren’t going to buy it as women after a whole awakening in the 70s. No one is going to accept that. So that started me on a path at relooking at these Disney princesses in a sort of different way. I feel that you have to have an empowering message or you’re not going to be relevant. If you don't stay relevant to how people are and how women are approaching life now, it’s not going to feel true."<ref name=LindaWL>{{cite web| title=The Impact of Legendary Linda Woolverton, Writer of Maleficent |url=http://widelantern.com/2014/06/the-impact-of-legendary-linda-woolverton-writer-of-maleficent/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305141229/http://widelantern.com/2014/06/the-impact-of-legendary-linda-woolverton-writer-of-maleficent/ |website=Wide Lantern |date=June 19, 2014 |access-date=August 23, 2015 |archive-date=March 5, 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref>
