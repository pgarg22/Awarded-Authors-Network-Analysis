'''Sir Charles Sedley, 5th Baronet''' (March 1639 – 20 August 1701), was an [[English people|English]] [[peerage of the United Kingdom|noble]], [[English drama|dramatist]] and [[government of the United Kingdom|politician]]. He was principally remembered for his wit and profligacy.<ref name=thacky>{{citation |editor-last=Harden |editor-first=Edgar F. |title=Selected Letters of [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=BzqvCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA150 150] }}.</ref>

==Life==
He was the son of Sir John Sedley, 2nd Baronet, of [[Aylesford]] in [[Kent]], and his wife Elizabeth, daughter of [[Henry Savile (Bible translator)|Sir Henry Savile]]. The Sedleys (also sometimes spelled Sidley) had been prominent in Kent since at least 1337. Sedley's grandfather, William Sedley, was knighted in 1605 and created a baronet in 1611. He was the founder of the ''Sidleian Lectures of Natural Philosophy at Oxford''. Sedley was educated at [[Wadham College, Oxford]], but left without taking a degree. There his tutor was the poet Walter Pope. The second surviving son of Sir John Sedley and Elizabeth, William, succeeded to the baronetcy in 1645. Charles Sedley inherited the title (5th baronet) in 1656 when his brother William died.
By his first wife Lady Katherine Savage, daughter of [[John Savage, 2nd Earl Rivers|John, 2nd Earl Rivers]] he had only one legitimate child, [[Catherine Sedley, Countess of Dorchester|Catherine, Countess of Dorchester]], mistress of James II. The couple lived in [[Great Queen Street]]. After his first wife had been sent to a convent in Ghent on account of a serious mental condition, Sedley in vain tried to obtain a divorce. He met Ann Ayscough, probably around 1670, by whom he had two illegitimate sons, William and Charles Sedley. William died in infancy, the brother Charles was knighted by [[William III of England|William III]] after the coronation in 1689 and created a baronet in 1702.<ref>Burke's Extinct and Dormant Baronetcies, p483</ref> The relationship with Ann Ayscough lasted to the end of Sedley's life. Sedley died at [[Hampstead]] on 20 August 1701 and was buried at Southfleet Church on the 26th.  The Sedley baronetcy became extinct on his death.<ref>Burke's Extinct and Dormant Baronetcies</ref>

Sedley is famous as a patron<ref>See ''"The Mulberry-Garden" and "Bellamira"'', ed. Hanowell, pp. xxxi-xxxii.</ref> of literature in the [[Restoration comedy|Restoration period]], and was the Francophile Lisideius of [[John Dryden|Dryden]]'s ''Essay of Dramatic Poesy''.<ref>Frank L. Huntley, "On the Persons in Dryden's ''Essay of Dramatic Poesy'', in: ''Essential Articles for the Study of John Dryden'', ed. H.T. Swedenberg Jr. (Hamden, CO, 1966), pp. 83-90.</ref> However, it was above all Sedley's ''wit'' that his contemporaries admired him for.<ref>''The Diary of Samuel Pepys'', ed. Latham and Matthews, Vol. V, p. 288 and Vol. VIII, p. 71. See also the presentation of Sedley in Gerard Langbaine, ''An Account of the Dramatick Poets. The English Stage: Attack and Defense 1577-1730'', ed. Arthur Freeman (New York and London, 1973.</ref>

Sedley was reputed as a notorious [[Rake (character)|rake]] and [[libertine]], part of the "Merry Gang" of courtiers which included the [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester|Earl of Rochester]] and [[Charles Sackville, 6th Earl of Dorset|Lord Buckhurst]].  In 1663 an indecent frolic in [[Bow Street]], for which he was fined 2000 marks, made Sedley notorious. From the balcony of Oxford Kate's Tavern he, Lord Buckhurst and Sir Thomas Ogle shocked and delighted a crowd of onlookers with their blasphemous and obscene antics. According to [[Samuel Pepys]], Sedley 'showed his nakedness - and abusing of scripture and as it were from thence preaching a mountebank sermon from the pulpit, saying that there he had to sell such a pouder as should make all the cunts in town run after him, 1000 people standing underneath to see and hear him, and that being done he took a glass of wine and washed his prick in it and then drank it off, and then took another and drank the King's health.'.  This behaviour provoked a riot amongst the onlookers and condemnation in the courts, where the [[Lord Chief Justice]] gave his opinion that it was because of wretches like him "that God's anger and judgement hang over us".<ref>Fergus Linnane (2006)'' The Lives of the English Rakes''. London, Portrait: 24-5</ref>

Sedley was [[member of parliament]] for [[New Romney]] in Kent, and took an active and useful part in politics. A speech of his on the civil list after the [[English Revolution|Revolution]] is cited by [[Thomas Macaulay|Macaulay]] as a proof that his reputation as a man of wit and ability was deserved. His ''bon mot'' at the expense of [[James II of England|James II]] is well known.  The king had seduced his daughter and created her countess of Dorchester, whereupon Sedley said: "As the king has made my daughter a countess, the least I can do, in common gratitude, is to assist in making his Majesty's daughter ([[Mary II of England|Mary]]) a queen". Sedley is also occasionally associated with a notorious gang of unbridled revellers who called themselves ''Ballers'' and who were active between 1660 and 1670. It was probably Sedley who wrote the ''Ballers' Oath'' on behalf of them.<ref>David M. Vieth, "Sir Charles Sedley and the Ballers' Oath," in: ''[[The Scriblerian and the Kit-Cats]]'', 12 (1979), 47-49.</ref>

Sedley's parliamentary career started in the 1660s but around 1677/78 he joined the Whig cause. When Charles II died in 1685, Sedley was illegally excluded from the parliament of his successor James II, which convened in May 1685. There can be no doubt that Sedley opposed the Catholic James and supported William of Orange in the crucial year of 1688.<ref>Pinto, ''Sir Charles Sedley: A Study in the Life'', p. 203</ref> Sedley was returned in the second Parliament of William, elected in March 1690. More speeches and parliamentary motions followed in 1690, including discussions on the Bill for regulating trials for High Treason, which sheds light on Sedley's political commitment after the Revolution. Sedley's speeches were included in the 1702 edition of ''The Miscellaneous Works''. Sedley kept his seat in Parliament until his death in 1701.

==Family==
Charles Sedley inherited the title (5th baronet) in 1656 when his brother William died. By his first wife, Lady Katherine Savage, daughter of [[John Savage, 2nd Earl Rivers]], he had only one legitimate child, [[Catherine, Countess of Dorchester]], who later became a mistress of [[James II of England]]. After his first wife had been sent to a convent in [[Ghent]] on account of a serious mental condition, Sedley tried in vain to obtain a [[divorce]]. He met Ann Ayscough, probably around 1670, by whom he had two illegitimate sons, William and Charles Sedley. William died in infancy, the brother Charles was knighted by [[William III of Orange]] after the coronation in 1689 and created a baronet in 1702. The relationship with Ann Ayscough lasted to the end of Sedley's life.

==Legacy==
His reputation as a wit and dissolute was partially responsible for the Sedleys of [[William Makepeace Thackeray]]'s ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]''.<ref name=thacky/>

==Works==
===Poems===
His most famous song, "Phyllis is My Only Joy", is much more widely known now than the author's name. While Sedley chiefly produced light amatory verse and pastoral dialogues in the 1670s, he turned to satirical epigrams in the 1680s and 1690s. His ''Epigrams: or, Court Characters'' are modelled on the works of [[Martial]]. In his epigram "To Nysus", for example, Sedley describes the function of satire and emphasizes the aggressive mode of satire: "Let us write satyr than, and at our ease / Vex the ill-natur'd Fools we cannot please."<ref>"Poetical and Dramatic Works", ed. Pinto, Vol. 1, p. 52, ll.7-8.</ref> At the same time, Sedley translated other specimens of ancient poetry, such as [[Virgil]]'s Georgics IV, the eighth Ode of the second Book of [[Horace]] and three elegies from [[Ovid]]'s ''Amores''. [[Dryden]] included Sedley's translations from Ovid in the ''Miscellany'' of 1684.

A number of his poems have been set to music: "Phyllis is My Only Joy" in a [[glee (music)|glee]] by [[John William Hobbs]] (1799-1877),<ref>[http://www.cpdl.org/wiki/images/3/32/Hobbs-phillis_is_my_only_joy.pdf 1]</ref> "Not, Celia, that I Juster Am" in a solo song by the English composer [[Elizabeth Turner]] (1700-1756),<ref>[http://www.cpdl.org/wiki/images/c/ca/Tur-not.pdf 2].</ref> <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yelloly|first=M.|date=2005-02-01|title='The ingenious Miss Turner': Elizabeth Turner (d 1756), singer, harpsichordist and composer|url=https://academic.oup.com/em/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/em/cah041|journal=Early Music|language=en|volume=33|issue=1|pages=65–80|doi=10.1093/em/cah041|issn=0306-1078}}</ref>and "Hears Not My Phillis" (Knotting Song, Z.371) in a solo song by the English composer [[Henry Purcell]] (1659-1695).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hyperion-records.co.uk/tw.asp?w=W3172|title=Hears not my Phillis how the birds 'The Knotting Song', Z371 - Hyperion Records - CDS, MP3 and Lossless downloads}}</ref> In 1692 Sedley wrote the birthday ode for [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary]], “Love’s goddess sure was blind”, which was also set to music by Purcell.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Wood|first=Bruce|title=Purcell: An Extraordinary Life|publisher=ABRSM|year=2009|isbn=9781860962981|location=London|pages=144}}</ref> The poem was printed in ''The Gentleman’s Journal'' of May 1692.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/30518192|title=Purcell studies|date=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Curtis Alexander Price|isbn=0-521-44174-9|location=Cambridge [England]|oclc=30518192}}</ref>

===Plays===
His first comedy, ''[[The Mulberry-Garden]]'' (1668), sustains Sedley's contemporary reputation for wit in conversation. The best, but most licentious, of his comedies is ''[[Bellamira (play)|Bellamira]]: or, The Mistress'' (1687), an imitation of the ''Eunuchus'' of [[Terence]], in which the heroine is supposed to represent [[Barbara Villiers, Duchess of Cleveland]], the mistress of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]. While ''The Mulberry-Garden'' exuberantly praises the achievements of the Restoration, ''[[Bellamira (play)|Bellamira]]'' displays a dark cynicism which has to be accounted for within a changed historical context. His two tragedies, ''Antony and Cleopatra'' (1677) and ''The Tyrant King of Crete'' (1702), an adaptation of [[Henry Killigrew (playwright)|Henry Killigrew]]'s ''Pallantus and Eudora'', have little merit. He also produced ''The Grumbler'' (1702), an adaptation of ''Le Grondeur'' of Brueys and Palaprat. However, many contents of the Sedley's posthumous edition are spurious.<ref>See ''Sir Charles Sedley's "The Mulberry-Garden" (1668) and "Bellamira, or: The Mistress" (1687)'', ed. Hanowell, p. xxiii</ref> Apart from the prologues of his own plays, Sedley wrote at least four more prologues to comedies, the best-known of which was written for [[Shadwell]]'s ''[[Epsom Wells]]''.<ref>Pierre Danchin, ''The Prologues and Epilogues of the Restoration 1660-1700'', 4 vols (Nancy, 1981).</ref>
