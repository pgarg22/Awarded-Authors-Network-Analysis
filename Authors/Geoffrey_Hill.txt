'''Sir Geoffrey William Hill''', [[Royal Society of Literature|FRSL]] (18 June 1932 – 30 June 2016) was an English poet, professor emeritus of English literature and religion, and former co-director of the [[Editorial Institute]], at [[Boston University]]. Hill has been considered to be among the most distinguished poets of his generation and was called the "greatest living poet in the English language."<ref name="Harold Bloom 1986">Harold Bloom, ed. ''Geoffrey Hill (Bloom's Modern Critical Views)'', Infobase Publishing, 1986.</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Nicholas|last=Lezard|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/20/broken-hierarchies-poems-geoffrey-hill-review|title=Broken Hierarchies: Poems 1952–2012 by Geoffrey Hill – review|newspaper=The Guardian|date=20 November 2013|access-date=20 November 2013}}</ref> 
From 2010 to 2015 he held the position of [[Oxford Professor of Poetry|Professor of Poetry]] in the [[University of Oxford]].<ref name="Archived copy">{{cite web |url=http://www.english.ox.ac.uk/news-events/regular-events/professor-poetry |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-07-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723095646/http://www.english.ox.ac.uk/news-events/regular-events/professor-poetry |archive-date=2014-07-23 }}</ref> Following his receiving the [[Truman Capote Award for Literary Criticism]] in 2009 for his ''Collected Critical Writings'', and the publication of ''Broken Hierarchies (Poems 1952–2012)'', Hill is recognised as one of the principal contributors to poetry and criticism in the 20th and 21st centuries.

==Biography==
Geoffrey Hill was born in [[Bromsgrove]], [[Worcestershire]], [[England]], in 1932, the son of a police constable. When he was six, his family moved to nearby [[Fairfield, Worcestershire|Fairfield]] in Worcestershire, where he attended the local primary school, then the grammar school in Bromsgrove. "As an only child, he developed the habit of going for long walks alone, as an adolescent deliberating and composing poems as he muttered to the stones and trees."<ref>Sherry, Vincent. ''The Uncommon Tongue: The Poetry and Criticism of Geoffrey Hill''. Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, 1987. 2.</ref> On these walks he often carried with him [[Oscar Williams]]' ''[[A Little Treasury of Modern Poetry]]'' (1946), and Hill speculates: "there was probably a time when I knew every poem in that anthology by heart."  In 1950 he was admitted to [[Keble College, Oxford]], to read English, where he published his first poems in 1952, at the age of twenty, in an eponymous [[Fantasy Press (poetry)|Fantasy Press]] volume (though he had published work in the ''Oxford Guardian''—the magazine of the [[Oxford University Liberal Club|University Liberal Club]]—and ''[[Isis magazine|The Isis]]'').

Upon graduation from [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] with a [[British undergraduate degree classification|first]], Hill embarked on an academic career, teaching at the [[University of Leeds]] from 1954 until 1980, from 1976 as [[professor]] of [[English Literature]]. After leaving Leeds, he spent a year at the [[University of Bristol]] on a Churchill Scholarship before becoming a teaching fellow at [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]], where he taught from 1981 until 1988. He then moved to the [[United States]], to serve as [[University Professors Program|University Professor]] and Professor of Literature and Religion at Boston University. In 2006, he moved back to Cambridge, England. 

Hill was married twice.  His first marriage to Nancy Whittaker, which produced four children, Julian, Andrew, Jeremy and Bethany, ended in divorce.  His second marriage to the American librettist, and Anglican priest, [[Alice Goodman]] occurred in 1987.  The couple had a daughter, Alberta.  The marriage lasted until Hill's death.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/01/geoffrey-hill-obituary | title=Sir Geoffrey Hill obituary | work=The Guardian | author=Robert Potts | date=2016-07-01 | access-date=2016-07-04}}</ref> Hill was a [[Christians|Christian]].<ref>Potts, Robert (10 August 2002), [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/aug/10/featuresreviews.guardianreview15 "The praise singer"], ''The Guardian''.</ref>

===Awards and honours===
''Mercian Hymns'' won the [[Alice Hunt Bartlett Prize]] and the inaugural [[1971 Whitbread Awards|Whitbread Award for Poetry]] in 1971. Hill won as well the [[Eric Gregory Award]] in 1961.

He delivered the 1998 [[Thomas Warton#Warton Lectures|Warton Lecture on English Poetry]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Hill, Geoffrey|title=Isaac Rosenberg, 1890–1918|journal=Proceedings of the British Academy|year=1999|volume=101|pages=209–228|url=https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/documents/2471/101p209-Hill.pdf}} (See [[Isaac Rosenberg]].)</ref>

Hill was awarded an honorary [[Doctor of Letters|D.Litt.]] degree by the University of Leeds in 1988, the same year he received an [[Ingram Merrill Foundation]] Award. Hill was also an [[List of Honorary Fellows of Keble College, Oxford|Honorary Fellow of Keble College, Oxford]]; an Honorary Fellow of [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]]; a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Literature]]; and a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. In 2009 his ''Collected Critical Writings'' won the [[Truman Capote Award for Literary Criticism]], the largest annual cash prize in English-language literary criticism.<ref>[http://www.news-releases.uiowa.edu/2009/april/041509capoteaward.html "Geoffrey Hill wins 2009 Truman Capote Award for Literary Criticism"], [[University of Iowa]] news release, 14 April 2009.</ref>

Hill was created a [[Knight Bachelor]] in the 2012 [[New Year Honours]] for services to literature.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=60009 |date=31 December 2011 |page=1 |supp=y }}</ref>

===Oxford candidacy===
In March 2010 Hill was confirmed as a candidate in the election of the [[Oxford Professor of Poetry|Professor of Poetry]] in the [[University of Oxford]], with a broad base of academic support.<ref>He was nominated by [[Andrew Graham (academic)|Andrew Graham]] (Master of [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]]), [[Brendan Callaghan]] (Master of [[Campion Hall, Oxford|Campion Hall]]), [[Christopher Andrew Lewis|Christopher Lewis]] (Dean of [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]]), [[Richard Carwardine]] (President of [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford|Corpus Christi]]), [[Ralph Waller]] (Principal of [[Harris Manchester College, Oxford|Harris Manchester]]), [[Averil Cameron]] (Warden of [[Keble College, Oxford|Keble]]), [[Tim Gardam]] (Principal of [[St Anne's College, Oxford|St Anne's]]), [[Roger Ainsworth]] (Master of [[St Catherine's College, Oxford|St Catherine's]]), [[Ivor Roberts (diplomat)|Sir Ivor Roberts, KCMG]] (President of [[Trinity College, Oxford|Trinity]]), and [[Hermione Lee|Hermione Lee, CBE]], (President of [[Wolfson College, Oxford|Wolfson]]) as well as by [[Bernard Silverman]] (formerly Master of [[St Peter's College, Oxford|St Peter's]]). He was also nominated by [[Rowan Williams]] and [[Geoffrey Rowell]], [[Wade Allison]], [[Alastair Buchan]], and [[Valentine Cunningham]].</ref><ref>[http://www.ox.ac.uk/about_the_university/oxford_people/professor_of_poetry/nominees/index.html Nominees.

Accessed 3 June 2010.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605081829/http://www.ox.ac.uk/about_the_university/oxford_people/professor_of_poetry/nominees/index.html |date=5 June 2010 }}</ref> He was ultimately successful, and delivered his 15 lectures in the academic years 2010 to 2015.<ref name="Archived copy"/><ref>[https://www.english.ox.ac.uk/professor-sir-geoffrey-hill-lectures "Professor Sir Geoffrey Hill lectures"], Faculty of English, University of Oxford.</ref> The lectures progressed chronologically, beginning with [[Shakespeare's sonnets]] and concluding with a critique of [[Philip Larkin]]'s poem "Church Going".

==Writing==
Hill's poetry encompasses a variety of styles, from the dense and allusive writing of ''King Log'' (1968) and ''Canaan'' (1997) through the simplified syntax of the sequence "The Pentecost Castle" in ''Tenebrae'' (1978), on to the more accessible poems of ''Mercian Hymns'' (1971), a series of 30 poems (sometimes called "prose-poems", a label which Hill rejects in favour of "versets")<ref>In "An Interview" with [[John Haffenden]] Hill remarks: "They're versets of rhythmical prose. The rhythm and cadence are far more of tuned chant than I think one normally associates with the prose poem. I designed the appearance on the page in the form of versets."  See also: Elisabeth Mary Knottenbelt, ''Passionate Intelligence: The Poetry of Geoffrey Hill'', p. 190.</ref> which juxtapose the history of [[Offa of Mercia|Offa]], eighth-century ruler of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of [[Mercia]], with Hill's own childhood in the modern Mercia of the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]]. [[Seamus Heaney]] said of Hill: "He has a strong sense of the importance of the maintenance of speech, a deep scholarly sense of the religious and political underpinning of everything in Britain."<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/5132022/Interview-with-Seamus-Heaney.html "Interview with Seamus Heaney"], ''The Telegraph'', 11 April 2009.</ref> Kenneth Haynes, editor of ''Broken Hierarchies'', commented: "the annotation is not the hard part with Hill's poems... the difficulty only begins after looking things up".<ref>Email to [[Sameer Rahim]], 2013, quoted in an interview with Sameer Rahim, "Poetry as History", ''Telegraph Review'', 14 December 2013.</ref> Elegy is Hill's dominant mode; he is a poet of phrases rather than cadences.<ref>Schmidt, Michael, ''The Great Modern Poets'', London: Quercus Books, 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-85738-246-7}}.</ref> Regarding both his style and subject, Hill is often described as a "difficult" poet. In an interview in ''[[The Paris Review]]'' (2000), which published Hill's early poem "Genesis" when he was still at Oxford, Hill defended the right of poets to difficulty as a form of resistance to the demeaning simplifications imposed by 'maestros of the world'. Hill also argued that to be difficult is to be democratic, equating the demand for simplicity with the demands of tyrants. He makes circumspect use of traditional rhetoric (as well as that of modernism), but he also transcribes the idioms of public life, such as those of television, political sloganeering, and punditry.

Hill has been consistently drawn to morally problematic and violent episodes in British and European history and has written poetic responses to the [[Holocaust]] in English, "Two Formal Elegies", "September Song" and "Ovid in the Third Reich". His accounts of landscape (especially that of his native Worcestershire) are as intense as his encounters with history. Hill has also worked in theatre – in 1978, the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] in [[London]] staged his 'version for the English stage' of [[Brand (play)|''Brand'']] by [[Henrik Ibsen]], written in rhyming verse. Hill's distaste for conclusion, however, has led him, in 2000's ''Speech! Speech!'' (118), to scorn the following argument as a glib get-out: '<small>ACCESSIBLE</small> / traded as <small>DEMOCRATIC</small>, he answers / as he answers móst things these days | easily.' Throughout his corpus Hill is uncomfortable with the muffling of truth-telling that verse designed to sound well, for its contrivances of harmony, must permit. The constant buffets of Hill's suspicion of lyric eloquence—can it truly ''be'' eloquent?—against his talent for it (in ''Syon'', a sky is 'livid with unshed snow') become in the poems a sort of battle in style, where passages of singing force (''ToL'': 'The ferns / are breast-high, head-high, the days / lustrous, with their hinterlands of thunder') are balanced with prosaic ones of academese and inscrutable syntax. In the long interview collected in [[John Haffenden|Haffenden]]'s ''Viewpoints'' there is described the poet warring himself to witness honestly, to make language as tool say truly what he believes is true of the world.<ref>Hill's 'seriousness' as a poet is examined in [[Robert Maximilian de Gaynesford]] 'The Seriousness of Poetry' ''Essays in Criticism'' 59, 2009, 1–21. The main point is that Hill's poetry reveals what his critical reflections in prose sometimes deny: that poetry is capable of [[performative utterance]] (in particular of commitment-issuing utterance). 
</ref>

==Criticism==
The violence of Hill's aesthetic has been criticised by the Irish poet-critic [[Tom Paulin]], who draws attention to the poet's use of the [[Virgil]]ian trope of 'rivers of blood' – as deployed infamously by [[Enoch Powell]] – to suggest that despite Hill's multi-layered irony and techniques of reflection, his lyrics draw their energies from an outmoded nationalism, expressed in what [[Hugh Haughton]] has described as a 'language of the past largely invented by the Victorians'.<ref>Tom Paulin, ''Minotaur: Poetry and the Nation State'', p. 283.</ref> Yet as Raphael Ingelbien notes, "Hill's England ... is a landscape which is fraught with the traces of a history that stretches so far back that it relativizes the Empire and its aftermath".<ref>Raphael Ingelbien, ''Misreading England: Poetry and Nationhood since the Second World War'', p. 34.</ref> [[Harold Bloom]] has called him "the strongest British poet now active."<ref name="Harold Bloom 1986"/>

For his part, Hill addressed some of the misperceptions about his political and cultural beliefs in a ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' interview in 2002. There he suggested that his affection for the "radical Tories" of the 19th century, while recently misunderstood as reactionary, was actually evidence of a progressive bent tracing back to his working-class roots. He also indicated that he could no longer draw a firm distinction between "Blairite Labour" and the Thatcher-era Conservatives, lamenting that both parties had become solely oriented toward "materialism".<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/aug/10/featuresreviews.guardianreview15/print "The Praise Singer" ''The Guardian'' 10 August 2002]</ref>

Hill's style has been subjected to parody: [[Wendy Cope]] includes a two-stanza parody of the ''Mercian Hymns'' entitled "Duffa Rex" in ''Making Cocoa for Kingsley Amis''.
