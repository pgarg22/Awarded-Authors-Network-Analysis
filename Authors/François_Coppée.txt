'''François Edouard Joachim Coppée''' (26 January 1842 – 23 May 1908) was a French [[poet]] and [[novelist]].

== Biography ==
Coppée was born in [[Paris]] to a civil servant. After attending the [[Lycée Saint-Louis]] he became a clerk in the ministry of war and won public favour as a poet of the [[Parnassian]] school. His first printed verses date from 1864. In 1869, his "Poème modernes" (among others ''La Grève de forgerons'') were quite successful. In the same year, Coppée's first play, ''Le Passant'', starring Sarah Bernhardt and Madame Agar,<ref>Bernhardt, My Double Life, London: Heinemann, 1907</ref> was received with approval at the Odéon theatre, and later ''Fais ce que dois'' (1871) and ''Les Bijoux de la délivrance'' (1872),<ref name=EB1911>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Coppée, François Édouard Joachim |volume=7 |pages=101–102}}</ref> short poetic dramas inspired by the [[Franco-Prussian War]], were applauded.

After holding a post in the library of the senate, Coppée was chosen in 1878 as archivist of the [[Comédie Française]], an office he held till 1884. In that year, his election to the [[Académie française]] caused him to retire from all public appointments. He was made an officer of the [[Legion of Honour]] in 1888.<ref name=EB1911 />

Coppée was famed as ''le poète des humbles'' (the poet of the humble). His verse and prose focus on plain expressions of emotion, patriotism, the joy of young love, and the pitifulness of the poor.<ref name=EB1911 /> Coppée continued to write plays, mostly serious dramas in verse, two of which were composed in collaboration with [[Armand d'Artois]].  The performance of a short episode of the Commune, ''Le Pater'', was prohibited by the government in 1889. Coppée published his first prose work in 1875 and went on to publish short stories, an autobiography of his youth, a series of short articles on miscellaneous subjects, and ''La Bonne Souffrance,'' a popular account of his reconversion to the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. His conversion was due to a severe illness which twice brought him close to death.<ref name=EB1911 />

Coppée was also interested in public affairs, joining the most violent section of the Nationalist movement (while remaining contemptuous of the apparatus of democracy) and taking a leading part against [[Alfred Dreyfus]] in the [[Dreyfus affair]].<ref>Wilson, Nelly (1978). ''Bernard-Lazare: Antisemitism and the Problem of Jewish Identity in Late Nineteenth-century France''. Cambridge University Press, p. 191.</ref>
He was one of the founders of the [[Ligue de la patrie française]],<ref name=EB1911 /> which originated in 1898 with three young academics, [[Louis Dausset]], [[Gabriel Syveton]] and [[Henri Vaugeois]], who wanted to show that Dreyfusism was not accepted by all at the University.{{sfn|Pierrard|1998|p=180}}
They launched a petition that attacked [[Émile Zola]] and what many saw as an internationalist, pacifist left-wing conspiracy.{{sfn|Conner|2014|p=160}}
[[Charles Maurras]] gained the interest of the writer [[Maurice Barrès]], and the movement gained the support of three eminent personalities: the geographer [[Marcel Dubois]], the poet François Coppée and the critic and literature professor [[Jules Lemaître]].{{sfn|Pierrard|1998|p=180}}

== Criticism ==
The poet [[Arthur Rimbaud]], a young contemporary of Coppée, published numerous parodies of Coppée's poetry. Rimbaud's parodies were published in ''[[L'Album Zutique]]'' (in 1871? 1872?). Most of these poems parody the style ("chatty comfortable rhymes" that were "the delight of the enlightened bourgeois of the day") and form ([[French alexandrine|alexandrine]] [[couplets]] arranged in ten line verses) of some short poems by Coppée.<ref>Examples can be found in the collection ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15324/15324-8.txt Promenades et Intérieurs]''.</ref> Rimbaud published them under the name ''François Coppée''.<ref>Hackett, Cecil Arthur (1981). ''Rimbaud, a Critical Introduction''. CUP Archive.</ref>

The poet [[Comte de Lautréamont|Lautréamont]] cited his ''Grève de Forgerons'' in the list of the "penpushers" to be absolutely ignored (''Poèsie, Part I'').
