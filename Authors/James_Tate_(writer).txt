==Biography==
Tate was born in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], where he lived with his mother and his grandparents in his grandparents' house. His father, a pilot in World War II, had died in combat on April 11, 1944, before Tate was a year old. Tate and his mother moved out after seven years when she remarried. The eventual poet said he belonged to a gang in high school and had little interest in literature. He planned on being a gas station attendant as his uncle had been, but finding that his friends to his surprise were going to college, he applied to Kansas State College of Pittsburg (now [[Pittsburg State University]]) in 1961. Tate wrote his first poem a few months into college with no external motivation; he observed that poetry "became a private place that I was hugely drawn to, where I could let my daydreams—and my pain—come in completely disguised. I knew from the moment I started writing that I never wanted to be writing about my life."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Simic|first1=Charles|title=Interview with James Tate|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/5636/the-art-of-poetry-no-92-james-tate|website=The Paris Review|access-date=24 June 2014}}</ref> In college he read [[Wallace Stevens]] and [[William Carlos Williams]] and was "in heaven". He received his B.A. in 1965, going on to earn his M.F.A. from the [[University of Iowa]]'s famed [[Iowa Writers' Workshop|Writer's Workshop]]. During this period he was finally exposed to fellow poets and he became interested in surrealism, reading [[Max Jacob]], [[Robert Desnos]], and [[André Breton]]; for [[Benjamin Péret]] he expressed particular affection. Of poets writing in Spanish, [[César Vallejo]] "destroyed" him but he was not so taken by the lyricism or romanticism of [[Pablo Neruda]] or [[Federico García Lorca]].

He was married to [[Dara Wier]]. Tate died on July 8, 2015 at the age of 71.<ref>http://www.recorder.com/home/17684626-95/acclaimed-poet-umass-professor-james-tate-dies-at-71</ref>

==Career==
Tate taught [[creative writing]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], [[Columbia University]],<ref name="AAAL"/> and at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], where he worked from 1971 until his death in 2015.<ref name="AAAL"/>  He was a member of the poetry faculty at the [[MFA Program for Poets & Writers]], along with [[Dara Wier]] and [[Peter Gizzi]].

[[Dudley Fitts]] selected Tate's first book of poems, ''The Lost Pilot'' (1967), for the [[Yale Series of Younger Poets]] while Tate was still a student at the Writers' Workshop; Fitts praised Tate's writing for its "natural grace."  Tate's first volume of poetry, ''Cages'', was published by Shepherd's Press, Iowa City, 1966.

Tate won the 1992 [[Pulitzer Prize]]<ref name=pulitzer/> and the Poetry Society of America's [[William Carlos Williams Award]] in 1991 for his ''Selected Poems''. In 1994, he won the [[National Book Award]] for his poetry collection ''Worshipful Company of Fletchers''.<ref name=nba1994/>

Tate's writing style is often described as surrealistic, comic and absurdist.<ref name="Poetry Foundation article on Tate">{{cite web|last=Hoagland |first=Tony |url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/james-tate |title=James Tate |publisher=The Poetry Foundation |access-date=2013-10-23}}</ref><ref>Ellman, Richard and Robert O'Clair.''The Norton Anthology of Modern Poetry'', Second edition. New York: W.W. Norton, 1988.</ref> His work has captivated other poets as diverse as [[John Ashbery]] and [[Dana Gioia]].<ref name="Poetry Foundation article on Tate"/><ref>Tate, James. ''Selected Poems''. Blurb.</ref> Regarding his own work, Tate said, "My characters usually are—or, I’d say most often, I don’t want to generalize too much—but most often they’re in trouble, and they’re trying to find some kind of life."<ref name="Poetry Foundation article on Tate"/> This view is supported by the poet [[Tony Hoagland]]'s observation that "his work of late has been in prose poems, in which his picaresque speaker or characters are spinning through life, inquisitive and clueless as [[Candide]], trying to identify and get with the fiction of whatever world they are in."<ref>{{cite web|last=Campion |first=Peter |url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/article/239968 |title=Recognition, Vertigo, and Passionate Worldliness by Tony Hoagland |publisher=Poetryfoundation.org |date=2010-09-01 |access-date=2013-10-23}}</ref>

In addition to many books of poetry, he published two books of prose, ''Dreams of a Robot Dancing Bee'' (2001) and ''The Route as Briefed'' (1999).

Some of Tate's additional awards included a [[National Institute of Arts and Letters]] Award, the [[Wallace Stevens Award]], and fellowships from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]] and the [[National Endowment for the Arts]]. He was also a Chancellor of the [[Academy of American Poets]].<ref>[http://www.umass.edu/english/eng/mfa/faculty.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060115161536/http://www.umass.edu/english/eng/mfa/faculty.html |date=January 15, 2006 }}</ref>
