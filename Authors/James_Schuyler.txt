He was a central figure in the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] and is often associated with fellow New York School poets [[John Ashbery]], [[Frank O'Hara]], [[Kenneth Koch]], and [[Barbara Guest]].

== Life and death ==
James Marcus Schuyler was the son of Marcus Schuyler (a reporter) and Margaret Daisy Connor Schuyler.

Born in [[Chicago]], he spent his teen years in [[East Aurora, New York]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poets/detail/james-schuyler|title=James Schuyler|website=www.poetryfoundation.org|access-date=2016-07-21}}</ref> After graduating high school, Schuyler attended [[Bethany College (West Virginia)|Bethany College]] in [[West Virginia]] from 1941 to 1943, though he was not a very successful student; in a later interview, he recalled, "I just played bridge all the time."<ref name="buffalo" />

Schuyler moved to [[New York City]] in the late 1940s where he worked for NBC and first befriended [[W. H. Auden]]. In 1947, he moved to [[Ischia]], [[Italy]], where he lived in Auden's rented apartment and worked as his secretary. Between 1947 and 1948, Schuyler attended the [[University of Florence]].<ref name="buffalo" />

After returning to the United States and settling in [[New York City]], he roomed with [[John Ashbery]] and [[Frank O'Hara]].

In April 1991, at age sixty-seven, Schuyler died in [[Manhattan]] following a [[stroke]]. His ashes were interred at the Little Portion Friary (Episcopal), Mt. Sinai, Long Island, New York.

== Personal life ==
Schuyler was not known for revealing much about his personal life. It is known that he was [[gay]], and was partners with [[William Aalto]] and [[John Button (artist)|John Button]]. Schuyler was [[manic depressive]],<ref name="glbtq">{{citation |last=Bergman |first=David |title=American Literature: Gay Male, Post-Stonewall |year=2002 |periodical=[[glbtq.com]] |url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/am_lit3_gay_post_stonewall,5.html |access-date=2007-09-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814062449/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/am_lit3_gay_post_stonewall%2C5.html |archive-date=August 14, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}.</ref> underwent several years of [[psychoanalysis]] and withstood many traumatic experiences. One of these includes a "[[near death experience]]" in a fire which he caused by smoking in bed.<ref name="Watkin">Watkin, William. "Let's Make a List": James Schuyler's Taxonomic Autobiography.

In a spring 1990 special issue of the ''Denver Quarterly'' that was written by [[Barbara Guest]] in devotion to Schuyler's work, Guest refers to Schuyler as an "intimist," saying:

{{blockquote|... for me Jimmy is the [[Vuillard]] of us, he withholds his secret, the secret thing until the moment appears to reveal it. We wait and wait for the name of a flower while we praise the careful cultivation. We wait for someone to speak, and it is Jimmy in an aside.<ref name="buffalo">''[http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~jconte/James_Schuyler_DLB.htm Dictionary of Literary Biography 169: American Poets Since World War II: James Schuyler]''.

== Inspiration and style ==

Schuyler's move to [[Italy]], as Auden's typist, was accompanied by his intention of writing. In 1981 he was said to have recalled "that he found Auden's elaborate formalism 'inhibiting'." This was likely an influence to his own "conversational style and proselike line".<ref name="buffalo" />

While living in [[New York City|New York]], Schuyler found inspiration in the art world. From 1955 to 1961, he was a "curator of circulating exhibitions at the [[Museum of Modern Art]]". He was also an editorial associate and critic for ''Art News''. While working as an editorial associate, Schuyler wrote criticism about a large amount of art. In an interview that was published in spring 2002, he said, "I did learn an awful lot during those years, and then went on in the 60s writing occasional articles about specific artists and their specific strategies. Partly it was to make money, and partly because I wanted to write about painting, about art."  His time as an art critic, then, became a major inspiration to his work.<ref name="buffalo" />

From 1961 to 1973 Schuyler lived with [[Fairfield Porter]] and his family in Southampton, Long Island. Porter became an influence for Schuyler as well, and he dedicated his first major collection, ''Freely Espousing'', to Anne and Fairfield Porter.<ref name="buffalo" />

Schuyler is noted for his ability to take things that are "normal" and bring out their greatness. He takes a look at things that many people may not see, or care to take note of, such as individual raindrops. He evaluates the ordinary and the way it works in relation to other things: "It's the water in the drinking glass the tulips are in./ It's a day like any other."<ref name="Watkin" />

Schuyler was responsible for writing [[Frank O'Hara]]'s elegy, "Buried at Springs". Schuyler recalls [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Ralph Waldo Emerson's]] [[transcendentalism]], and uses nature to express himself in the elegy. Schuyler also has several works that are about, or that reference lists.<ref name="Watkin" />

In his ''Diary'', Schuyler says that he is "more of a reader than a writer", and "everything happens as I write".<ref name="Watkin" />

== Awards ==

Schuyler received the 1981 [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]] for his 1980 collection ''The Morning of the Poem''. He also coauthored a novel, ''A Nest of Ninnies'', with [[John Ashbery]] in 1969. Schuyler also received the Longview Foundation Award in 1961, and the Frank O'Hara Prize for ''Poetry'' in 1969 for ''Freely Espousing.''<ref name="buffalo" />

Schuyler was a [[Guggenheim Fellow]], a fellow of the [[American Academy of Poets]],<ref>{{cite book |title=The World Almanac and Book of Facts 1985 |date=1984 |publisher=Newspaper Enterprise Association, Inc. |location=New York |isbn=0-911818-71-5 |page=414 }}</ref> and a 1985 recipient of the [[Whiting Awards|Whiting Award]].
