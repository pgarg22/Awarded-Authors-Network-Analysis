She started her career in publishing as an editorial assistant in New York City.<ref name="sfs1a">{{cite news |first=Michael M. |last=Jones |work=SF Site |title=Staying Dead |url=http://www.sfsite.com/09a/sd183.htm |date=September 2004 |accessdate=October 2, 2010}}</ref> Laura Anne Gilman is a member of the BookView Cafe, [[Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America]], and Novelists, Inc.

After publishing several short stories (her first professional fiction sale was 1994 to ''[[Amazing Stories]]''), some media tie-ins, and a job as an executive editor she published her first original novel ''Staying Dead'', a "Cosa Nostradamus"-universe "Retrievers" book.<ref name="sfs1a"/> The first book of a second series in this universe named "Paranormal Scene Investigations", ''Hard Magic'', was published in Spring 2010, and a second should follow in Spring 2011.

====The Vineart War====
"Wine. A world with a source of magic that is grapes, in the vintages made with each different strain of grapes. Wait, before you wander off, think about that a minute. Think of how much goes into a bottle of wine, from how the grapes are grown to how each harvest is gathered and [[pressed (wine)|pressed]] and bottled. Then add in a touch of magic along with the flavor, binding an intent with each batch. It made for a phenomenal structure to build on. Each geographical area in the Lands Vin has its own particular vintage, its own magical specialty.

The Vinearts, those responsible for crafting each vintage, are a solitary caste, tending their vines and wines and rarely communicating with each other. The creation myth of the vines themselves is based on this structure of each tending to their own specialty. But as the book progresses, it becomes apparent to one Master that this solitude cannot continue as it is. Something is going very wrong in the vineyards, from pests to plagues out of season, and it drives that Master Vineart to break that solitude and try to gather information before the vines are lost.

The threat is very real, and the sense of urgency pulls the reader from page to page. The reader starts following the development of a new apprentice Vineart, where we gain a sense of the Vinearts love for their vines, and the magic that they infuse into their wines. And from there the world widens, as the reader learns of the problems emerging throughout the Lands Vin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fireun.livejournal.com/1131254.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120710031147/http://fireun.livejournal.com/1131254.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=10 July 2012 |title=Book Rec- "Flesh and Fire" by Laura Anne Gilman |accessdate=3 February 2012 }}</ref>"
