'''Sylvia Plath''' ({{IPAc-en|p|l|æ|θ}}; October 27, 1932&nbsp;– February 11, 1963) was an American poet, novelist, and short-story writer. She is credited with advancing the genre of [[confessional poetry]] and is best known for two of her published collections, ''[[The Colossus and Other Poems]]'' (1960) and ''[[Ariel (poetry collection)|Ariel]]'' (1965), as well as ''[[The Bell Jar]]'', a [[semi-autobiographical novel]] published shortly before her death in 1963. ''The Collected Poems'' were published in 1981, which included previously unpublished works. For this collection Plath was awarded a [[Pulitzer Prize]] in Poetry in 1982, making her the fourth to receive this honour posthumously.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kihss |first1=Peter |title=Sessions, Sylvia Plath and Updike Are Among Pulitzer Prize Winners |url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/98/03/01/home/plath-pulitzer.html |access-date=10 March 2021 |work=[[The New York Times]] }}</ref>

Born in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], Plath studied at [[Smith College]] in Massachusetts and at [[Newnham College]] in [[Cambridge]], England. She married fellow poet [[Ted Hughes]] in 1956, and they lived together in the United States and then in England. Their relationship was tumultuous and, in her letters, Plath alleges abuse at his hands.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/11/unseen-sylvia-plath-letters-claim-domestic-abuse-by-ted-hughes|title=Unseen Sylvia Plath letters claim domestic abuse by Ted Hughes|last=Kean|first=Danuta|date=11 April 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=9 March 2021|issn=0261-3077|quote=The letters are part of an archive amassed by feminist scholar Harriet Rosenstein seven years after the poet’s death, as research for an unfinished biography. }}</ref>  They had two children before separating in 1962.

Plath was [[Major depressive disorder|clinically depressed]] for most of her adult life, and was treated multiple times with [[electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT). She killed <!-- Please do not change to "committed suicide" or "died by suicide". See Talk page.-->herself in 1963.

Otto Plath died on November 5, 1940, a week and a half after Plath's eighth birthday,<ref name="Axelrod"/> of complications following the [[amputation]] of a foot due to untreated [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]]. He had become ill shortly after a close friend died of [[lung cancer]]. Comparing the similarities between his friend's symptoms and his own, Otto became convinced that he, too, had lung cancer and did not seek treatment until his diabetes had progressed too far. Raised as a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]], Plath experienced a loss of faith after her father's death and remained ambivalent about religion throughout her life.<ref>Peel (2007) pp. 41–44</ref> Her father was buried in [[Winthrop, Massachusetts|Winthrop]] Cemetery, in Massachusetts. A visit to her father's grave later prompted Plath to write the poem "Electra on Azalea Path".

===College years and depression===
[[File:Smith College.jpg|alt=|thumb|left|[[Smith College]], in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]]]]

In 1950, Plath attended [[Smith College]], a private women's liberal arts college in Massachusetts. She excelled academically. While at Smith, she lived in Lawrence House, and a plaque can be found outside her old room. She edited ''The Smith Review.'' After her third year of college, Plath was awarded a coveted position as a guest editor at ''[[Mademoiselle (magazine)|Mademoiselle]]'' magazine, during which she spent a month in New York City.<ref name="ODNB" /> The experience was not what she had hoped for, and many of the events that took place during that summer were later used as inspiration for her novel ''[[The Bell Jar]].<ref name=":0">{{cite web|title=Sylvia Platt|url=https://sophia.smith.edu/blog/smithipedia/alumnae/sylvia-plath-1955/|access-date=20 June 2021|website=Smith College|publisher=Smith College}}</ref>''

She was furious at not being at a meeting the editor had arranged with Welsh poet [[Dylan Thomas]]—a writer whom she loved, said one of her boyfriends, "more than life itself." She hung around the [[White Horse Tavern (New York City)|White Horse Tavern]] and the [[Hotel Chelsea|Chelsea Hotel]] for two days, hoping to meet Thomas, but he was already on his way home. A few weeks later, she slashed her legs to see if she had enough "courage" to kill herself.<ref>Thomas (2008) p. 35</ref> During this time she was refused admission to the Harvard writing seminar.<ref name="ODNB-online">Brown & Taylor (2004), ''ODNB'' online</ref> Following [[electroconvulsive therapy]] for depression, Plath made her first medically documented suicide attempt on August 24, 1953<ref>http://www.sylviaplath.info/documents/Steinberg_2010_Search.pdf</ref> by crawling under the front porch and taking her mother's sleeping pills.<ref>Kibler (1980) pp. 259–264</ref>

[[File:Cambridge Newnham.JPG|right|thumb|Sidgwick Hall at [[Newnham College]]]]

She survived this first suicide attempt, later writing that she "blissfully succumbed to the whirling blackness that I honestly believed was eternal oblivion."<ref name="ODNB"/> She spent the next six months in psychiatric care, receiving more electric and [[Insulin shock therapy|insulin shock treatment]] under the care of [[Ruth Beuscher]].<ref name="ODNB"/> Her stay at [[McLean Hospital]] and her Smith Scholarship were paid for by [[Olive Higgins Prouty]], who had successfully recovered from a mental breakdown herself. Plath seemed to make a good recovery and returned to college.

In January 1955, she submitted her thesis, ''The Magic Mirror: A Study of the Double in Two of [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoyevsky]]'s Novels'', and in June graduated from Smith with an [[A.B.]] ''[[summa cum laude]]''.<ref name="Kirk-xix" /> She was a member of the [[Phi Beta Kappa]] academic [[honor society]].<ref name=":0" />

She obtained a [[Fulbright Scholarship]] to study at [[Newnham College, Cambridge|Newnham College]], one of the two women-only colleges of the [[University of Cambridge]] in England, where she continued actively writing poetry and publishing her work in the student newspaper ''[[Varsity (Cambridge)|Varsity]]''. At Newnham, she studied with [[Dorothea Krook]], whom she held in high regard.<ref>Peel (2007) p. 44</ref> She spent her first year winter and spring holidays traveling around Europe.<ref name="ODNB"/>

===Career and marriage===
[[File:Administration Building, McLean Hospital, Belmont MA.jpg|alt=|thumb|Plath's stay at [[McLean Hospital]] inspired her novel ''[[The Bell Jar]]'']]

Plath first met poet [[Ted Hughes]] on February 25, 1956. In a 1961 BBC interview (now held by the [[British Library Sound Archive]]),<ref name="Guardian-2010">{{cite web |title=Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes talk about their relationship |date=April 15, 2010 |location=London |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2010/apr/15/sylvia-plath-ted-hughes |access-date=July 9, 2010}} Extract from the 1961 BBC interview with Plath and Hughes. Now held in the [[British Library]] Sound Archive.</ref> Plath describes how she met Hughes:
<blockquote>
I'd read some of Ted's poems in this magazine and I was very impressed and I wanted to meet him. I went to this little celebration and that's actually where we met... Then we saw a great deal of each other. Ted came back to Cambridge and suddenly we found ourselves getting married a few months later... We kept writing poems to each other. Then it just grew out of that, I guess, a feeling that we both were writing so much and having such a fine time doing it, we decided that this should keep on.<ref name="Guardian-2010"/>
</blockquote> Plath described Hughes as "a singer, story-teller, lion and world-wanderer" with "a voice like the thunder of God."<ref name="ODNB"/>

The couple married on June 16, 1956, at [[St George the Martyr, Holborn]] in London (now in the [[London Borough of Camden|Borough of Camden]]) with Plath's mother in attendance, and spent their honeymoon in Paris and [[Benidorm]]. Plath returned to Newnham in October to begin her second year.<ref name="ODNB"/> During this time, they both became deeply interested in [[astrology]] and the supernatural, using [[ouija]] boards.<ref>Bloom, Harold (2007) ''Sylvia Plath'', Infobase Publishing p. 76</ref>

In June 1957, Plath and Hughes moved to the United States, and from September, Plath taught at Smith College, her alma mater. She found it difficult to both teach and have enough time and energy to write,<ref name="Kirk-xix">Kirk (2004) p. xix</ref> and in the middle of 1958, the couple moved to [[Boston]]. Plath took a job as a receptionist in the psychiatric unit of [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] and in the evening sat in on creative writing seminars given by poet [[Robert Lowell]] (also attended by the writers [[Anne Sexton]] and [[George Starbuck]]).<ref name="Kirk-xix"/>

Both Lowell and Sexton encouraged Plath to write from her experience and she did so. She openly discussed her depression with Lowell and her suicide attempts with Sexton, who led her to write from a more female perspective. Plath began to consider herself as a more serious, focused poet and short-story writer.<ref name="ODNB"/> At this time Plath and Hughes first met the poet [[W. S. Merwin]], who admired their work and was to remain a lifelong friend.<ref>Helle (2007){{page needed|date=July 2017}}</ref> Plath resumed psychoanalytic treatment in December, working with Ruth Beuscher.<ref name="ODNB"/>

Plath and Hughes traveled across Canada and the United States, staying at the [[Yaddo]] artist colony in [[Saratoga Springs, New York]] in late 1959. Plath says that it was here that she learned "to be true to my own weirdnesses", but she remained anxious about writing confessionally, from deeply personal and private material.<ref name="ODNB"/><ref>''Journals'' pp. 520–521</ref> The couple moved back to England in December 1959 and lived in London at 3 Chalcot Square, near the [[Primrose Hill]] area of [[Regent's Park]], where an [[English Heritage]] plaque records Plath's residence.<ref name="Kirk-xx">Kirk (2004) p. xx</ref><ref name="London Remembers">{{cite web |title=Plaque: Sylvia Plath |work=London Remembers |url=http://www.londonremembers.com/memorials/sylvia-plath |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322105555/http://www.londonremembers.com/memorials/sylvia-plath |archive-date=March 22, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> Their daughter [[Frieda Hughes|Frieda]] was born on April 1, 1960, and in October, Plath published her first collection of poetry, ''[[The Colossus and Other Poems|The Colossus]]''.<ref name="Kirk-xx"/>

In February 1961, Plath's second pregnancy ended in miscarriage; several of her poems, including "Parliament Hill Fields", address this event.<ref>Kirk (2004) p. 85</ref> In a letter to her therapist, Plath wrote that Hughes beat her two days before the miscarriage.<ref name="Kean-2017">{{cite news |last=Kean |first=Danuta |date=April 11, 2017 |title=Unseen Sylvia Plath letters claim domestic abuse by Ted Hughes |location=London |work=[[The Guardian]] |url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/11/unseen-sylvia-plath-letters-claim-domestic-abuse-by-ted-hughes |access-date=April 14, 2017}}</ref> In August she finished her semi-autobiographical novel ''[[The Bell Jar]]'' and immediately after this, the family moved to [[Court Green]] in the small market town of [[North Tawton]] in [[Devon]].

In 1961, the couple rented their flat at Chalcot Square to [[Assia Wevill|Assia Wevill (née Gutmann)]] and [[David Wevill]].

In July 1962, Plath discovered Hughes had been having an affair with Assia Wevill; in September Plath and Hughes separated.<ref name="Kirk-xx"/>

Beginning in October 1962, Plath experienced a great burst of creativity and wrote most of the poems on which her reputation now rests, writing at least 26 of the poems of her posthumous collection ''[[Ariel (poetry collection)|Ariel]]'' during the final months of her life.<ref name="Kirk-xx"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Sylvia Plath |work=The Poetry Archive |url=http://www.poetryarchive.org/poet/sylvia-plath |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703202957/http://www.poetryarchive.org/poet/sylvia-plath |archive-date=July 3, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath—a marriage examined">[https://web.archive.org/web/20051218022114/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2242/is_1669_286/ai_n13247735 ''Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath&nbsp;– a marriage examined''.

[[William Butler Yeats]] once lived in the house, which bears an English Heritage [[blue plaque]] for the Irish poet. Plath was pleased by this fact and considered it a good omen.

The northern winter of 1962–1963 was one of the coldest in 100 years; the pipes froze, the children—now two years old and nine months—were often sick, and the house had no telephone.<ref name="Gifford-2008">Gifford (2008) p. 15</ref> Her depression returned but she completed the rest of her poetry collection, which would be published after her death (1965 in the UK, 1966 in the US).

In January{{nbsp}}1963, Plath spoke with [[John Horder]], her [[general practitioner]]<ref name="Cooper-2003"/> and a close friend who lived near her. She described the current depressive episode she was experiencing; it had been ongoing for six or seven months.<ref name="Cooper-2003"/> While for most of the time she had been able to continue working, her depression had worsened and become severe, "marked by constant agitation, suicidal thoughts and inability to cope with daily life."<ref name="Cooper-2003"/> Plath struggled with [[insomnia]], taking medication at night to induce sleep, and frequently woke up early.<ref name="Cooper-2003"/> She lost 20{{nbsp}}pounds (9&nbsp;kg).<ref name="Cooper-2003"/> However, she continued to take care of her physical appearance and did not outwardly speak of feeling guilty or unworthy.<ref name="Cooper-2003"/>
[[File:23 Fitzroy Road, London - Sylvia Plath - W.B. Yeats.jpg|thumb|upright|left|23 Fitzroy Road, near [[Primrose Hill]], London, where Plath died by suicide]]

Horder prescribed her an anti-depressant, a [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]],<ref name="Cooper-2003"/> a few days before her suicide. Knowing she was at risk alone with two young children, he says he visited her daily and made strenuous efforts to have her admitted to a hospital; when that failed, he arranged for a live-in nurse. Commentators have argued that because anti-depressants may take up to three weeks to take effect, her prescription from Horder would not have taken full effect.<ref>Alexander (2003) p. 325</ref>

The nurse was due to arrive at nine on the morning of February 11, 1963, to help Plath with the care of her children. Upon arrival, she could not get into the flat but eventually gained access with the help of a workman, Charles Langridge. They found Plath dead with her head in the oven, having sealed the rooms between her and her sleeping children with tape, towels and cloths.<ref>Stevenson (1990) p. 296</ref> She was 30{{nbsp}}years old.<ref name="Feinmann-1993"/>

Plath's intentions have been debated. That morning, she asked her downstairs neighbor, a Mr.{{nbsp}}Thomas, what time he would be leaving. She also left a note reading "Call Dr.{{nbsp}}Horder," including the doctor's phone number. It is argued Plath turned on the gas at a time when Thomas would have been able to see the note.<ref>Kirk (2004) p. 103</ref> However, in her biography ''Giving Up: The Last Days of Sylvia{{nbsp}}Plath,'' Plath's best friend, [[Jillian Becker]], wrote, "According to Mr.{{nbsp}}Goodchild, a police officer attached to the coroner's office, [Plath] had thrust her head far into the gas oven and had really meant to die."<ref>Becker (2003)</ref> Horder also believed her intention was clear. He stated that "No one who saw the care with which the kitchen was prepared could have interpreted her action as anything but an irrational compulsion."<ref name="Feinmann-1993"/> Plath had described the quality of her despair as "owl's talons clenching my heart."<ref>{{cite news |last=Guthmann |first=Edward |date=October 30, 2005 |title=The Allure: Beauty and an easy route to death have long made the Golden Gate Bridge a magnet for suicides |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Lethal-Beauty-The-Allure-Beauty-and-an-easy-3302966.php#page-6 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525104344/http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Lethal-Beauty-The-Allure-Beauty-and-an-easy-3302966.php |archive-date=May 25, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> In his 1971 book on suicide, friend and critic [[Al Alvarez]] claimed that Plath's suicide was an unanswered cry for help,<ref name="Feinmann-1993"/> and spoke, in a BBC interview in March{{nbsp}}2000, about his failure to recognize Plath's depression, saying he regretted his inability to offer her emotional support: "I failed her on that level.

{{main|Sylvia Plath bibliography}}
Plath wrote poetry from the age of eight, her first poem appearing in the ''[[Boston Evening Traveller|Boston Traveller]]''.<ref name="ODNB"/> By the time she arrived at Smith College she had written over 50 short stories and been published in a raft of magazines.<ref name="Stevenson-1994">Stevenson (1994)</ref> In fact Plath desired much of her life to write prose and stories, and she felt that poetry was an aside. But, in sum, she was not successful in publishing prose. At Smith she majored in English and won all the major prizes in writing and scholarship. Additionally, she won a summer editor position at the young women's magazine ''[[Mademoiselle (magazine)|Mademoiselle]]'',<ref name="ODNB" /> and, on her graduation in 1955, she won the [[Glascock Prize]] for "[[Two Lovers and a Beachcomber by the Real Sea]]". Later, she wrote for the university publication, ''[[Varsity (Cambridge)|Varsity]]''.

Nights, I squat in the cornucopia
Of your left ear, out of the wind,

Counting the red stars and those of plum-color.
The sun rises under the pillar of your tongue.
My hours are married to shadow.
No longer do I listen for the scrape of a keel
On the blank stones of the landing.

By the time [[Heinemann (book publisher)|Heinemann]] published her first collection, ''The Colossus and Other Poems'' in the UK in late 1960, Plath had been short-listed several times in the [[Yale Series of Younger Poets Competition|Yale Younger Poets]] book competition and had had work printed in ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]]'', ''[[The Spectator]]'' and ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]''. All the poems in ''The Colossus'' had already been printed in major US and British journals and she had a contract with ''[[The New Yorker]]''.<ref name="Wagner">Wagner-Martin (1988) pp. 2–5</ref> It was, however, her 1965 collection ''Ariel'', published posthumously, on which Plath's reputation essentially rests. "Often, her work is singled out for the intense coupling of its violent or disturbed imagery and its playful use of alliteration and rhyme."<ref name="poets1"/>

''The Colossus'' received largely positive UK reviews, highlighting Plath's voice as new and strong, individual and American in tone. [[Peter Dickinson]] at ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' called the collection "a real find" and "exhilarating to read", full of "clean, easy verse".<ref name="Wagner"/> [[Bernard Bergonzi]] at the ''[[Manchester Guardian]]'' said the book was an "outstanding technical accomplishment" with a "virtuoso quality".<ref name="Wagner"/> From the point of publication she became a presence on the poetry scene. The book went on to be published in America in 1962 to less-glowing reviews. Whilst her craft was generally praised, her writing was viewed as more derivative of other poets.<ref name="Wagner"/>

===''The Bell Jar''===
{{Main|The Bell Jar}}

Plath's semi-autobiographical novel&mdash;her mother wanted  to block publication&mdash;was published in 1963 and in the US in 1971.<ref name="Kirk-xxi"/><ref>McCullough (2005) p. xii</ref> Describing the compilation of the book to her mother, she wrote, "What I've done is to throw together events from my own life, fictionalising to add color&mdash;it's a [[potboiler|pot boiler]] really, but I think it will show how isolated a person feels when he is suffering a breakdown... I've tried to picture my world and the people in it as seen through the distorting lens of a bell jar".<ref>Plath ''Biographical Note'' 294–295. From Wagner-Martin (1988) p. 107</ref> She described her novel as "an autobiographical apprentice work which I had to write in order to free myself from the past".<ref>Plath ''Biographical Note 293''. From Wagner-Martin (1988) p. 112</ref> She dated a [[Yale]] senior named Dick Norton during her junior year. Norton, upon whom the character of Buddy in ''[[The Bell Jar]]'' is based, contracted [[tuberculosis]] and was treated at the [[Ray Brook Sanatorium]] near [[Saranac Lake, New York|Saranac Lake]]. While visiting Norton, Plath broke her leg skiing, an incident that was fictionalized in the novel.<ref>Taylor (1986)</ref> Plath also used the novel to highlight the issue of women in the workforce during the 1950s. She strongly believed in women's abilities to be writers and editors, while society forced them to fulfill secretarial roles.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Jernigan |first=Adam T. |date=January 1, 2014 |title=Paraliterary Labors in Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar: Typists, Teachers, and the Pink-Collar Subtext |journal=[[Modern Fiction Studies]] |volume=60 |issue=1 |pages=1–27 |oclc=5561439112 |doi=10.1353/mfs.2014.0010|s2cid=162359742 }}</ref>

=== ''Double Exposure'' ===
In 1963, after ''The Bell Jar'' was published, Plath began working on another literary work titled ''Double Exposure.'' It was never published and the manuscript disappeared around 1970.<ref name="Ferretter-2009">Ferretter (2009)</ref> According to Hughes, Plath left behind "some 130 [typed] pages of another novel, provisionally titled ''Double Exposure''."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://lostmanuscripts.com/2010/09/20/the-ghost-of-plaths-double-exposure |title=The Ghost of Plath's Double Exposure |publisher=Lost Manuscripts |date=August 29, 2010 |access-date=April 6, 2012 }}</ref> Theories about what happened to the unfinished manuscript are repeatedly brought up in the book ''Sylvia Plath's Fiction: A Critical Study'' by Luke Ferretter including the claim that the rare books department at Smith College in Massachusetts has a secret copy of the work under seal<ref name="Ferretter-2009"/> or that the draft of ''Double Exposure'' may have been destroyed, stolen, or even lost.

The posthumous publication of ''Ariel'' in 1965 precipitated Plath's rise to fame.<ref name="ODNB"/>  The poems in ''[[Ariel (Plath)|Ariel]]'' mark a departure from her earlier work into a more personal arena of poetry. [[Robert Lowell]]'s poetry may have played a part in this shift as she cited Lowell's 1959 book ''[[Life Studies]]'' as a significant influence, in an interview just before her death.<ref name="WM184">Wagner-Martin (1988) p. 184</ref> The impact of ''Ariel'' was dramatic, with its dark and potentially autobiographical descriptions of mental illness in poems such as "[[Tulips (poem)|Tulips]]", "[[Daddy (poem)|Daddy]]" and "[[Lady Lazarus]]".<ref name="WM184"/> Plath's work is often held within the genre of [[confessional poetry]] and the style of her work compared to other contemporaries, such as [[Robert Lowell]] and [[W. D. Snodgrass]]. Plath's close friend [[Al Alvarez]], who wrote about her extensively, said of her later work: "Plath's case is complicated by the fact that, in her mature work, she deliberately used the details of her everyday life as raw material for her art. A casual visitor or unexpected telephone call, a cut, a bruise, a kitchen bowl, a candlestick—everything became usable, charged with meaning, transformed. Her poems are full of references and images that seem impenetrable at this distance, but which could mostly be explained in footnotes by a scholar with full access to the details of her life."<ref>Alvarez (2007) p. 214</ref> Many of Plath's later poems deal with what one critic calls the "domestic surreal" in which Plath takes everyday elements of life and twists the images, giving them an almost nightmarish quality. Plath's poem "Morning Song" from ''Ariel'' is regarded as one of her  finest poems on ''freedom of expression'' of an artist.<ref>{{Cite web|title=10 Most Famous Poems by Sylvia Plath {{!}} Learnodo Newtonic|url=https://learnodo-newtonic.com/sylvia-plath-famous-poems|website=learnodo-newtonic.com|access-date=May 30, 2020}}</ref>

Plath's fellow confessional poet and friend [[Anne Sexton]] commented: "Sylvia and I would talk at length about our first suicide, in detail and in depth—between the free potato chips. Suicide is, after all, the opposite of the poem. Sylvia and I often talked opposites. We talked death with burned-up intensity, both of us drawn to it like moths to an electric lightbulb, sucking on it. She told the story of her first suicide in sweet and loving detail, and her description in ''The Bell Jar'' is just that same story."<ref>[http://www.theparisreview.org/viewinterview.php/prmMID/4073 ''The Paris Review'' Interviews: "The Art of Poetry No. 15. Anne Sexton". Interview by Barbara Kevles. Issue 52, Summer 1971]. Accessed July 15, 2010</ref> The confessional interpretation of Plath's work has led to some dismissing certain aspects of her work as an exposition of sentimentalist melodrama; in 2010, for example, [[Theodore Dalrymple]] asserted that Plath had been the "patron saint of self-dramatisation" and of [[self-pity]].<ref>Dalrymple (2010) p. 157</ref> Revisionist critics such as Tracy Brain have, however, argued against a tightly autobiographical interpretation of Plath's material.<ref>Brain (2001); Brain (2006); Brain (2007)</ref>

===Other works===
In 1971, the volumes ''Winter Trees'' and ''Crossing the Water'' were published in the UK, including nine previously unseen poems from the original manuscript of ''Ariel''.<ref name="Kirk-xxi"/> Writing in ''[[New Statesman]],'' fellow poet [[Peter Porter (poet)|Peter Porter]] wrote:

<blockquote>
''Crossing the Water'' is full of perfectly realised works. Its most striking impression is of a front-rank artist in the process of discovering her true power. Such is Plath's control that the book possesses a singularity and certainty which should make it as celebrated as ''The Colossus'' or ''Ariel''.<ref>Plath, Sylvia. ''The Colossus and Other Poems'', Faber and Faber, 1977.</ref>
</blockquote>

The ''Collected Poems'', published in 1981, edited and introduced by Ted Hughes, contained poetry written from 1956 until her death. Plath was posthumously awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]].<ref name="Kirk-xxi"/> In 2006 [[Anna Journey]], then a graduate student at [[Virginia Commonwealth University]], discovered a previously unpublished [[sonnet]] written by Plath titled [[Ennui (sonnet)|"Ennui"]]. The poem, composed during Plath's early years at Smith College, was published in the online journal ''[[Blackbird (online journal)|Blackbird]]''.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/oct/31/news |title = Unpublished Plath sonnet goes online tomorrow | agency= Associated Press | date = October 31, 2006 | access-date = April 29, 2012}}</ref>{{efn|1=Two poems titled ''Ennui (I)'' and ''Ennui (II)'' are listed in a partial catalogue of Plath's [[juvenilia]] in the ''Collected Poems''. A note explains that the texts of all but half a dozen of the many pieces listed are in the Sylvia Plath Archive of juvenilia in the [[Lilly Library]] at Indiana University. The rest are with the Sylvia Plath Estate.}}

===Journals and letters===
Plath's letters were published in 1975, edited and selected by her mother [[Aurelia Plath]]. The collection, ''Letters Home: Correspondence 1950–1963'', came out partly in response to the strong public reaction to the publication of ''The Bell Jar'' in America.<ref name="Kirk-xxi"/> Plath began keeping a diary from the age of 11 and continued doing so until her suicide. Her adult diaries, starting from her first year at Smith College in 1950, were first published in 1982 as ''The Journals of Sylvia Plath,'' edited by Frances McCullough, with Ted Hughes as consulting editor. In 1982, when Smith College acquired Plath's remaining journals, Hughes sealed two of them until February 11, 2013, the 50th anniversary of Plath's death.<ref name="Kirk-xxii">Kirk (2004) p. xxii</ref>

During the last years of his life, Hughes began working on a fuller publication of Plath's journals. In 1998, shortly before his death, he unsealed the two journals, and passed the project onto his children by Plath, Frieda and Nicholas, who passed it on to Karen V. Kukil. Kukil finished her editing in December 1999, and in 2000 [[Random House|Anchor Books]] published ''The Unabridged Journals of Sylvia Plath'' (Plath 2000). More than half of the new volume contained newly released material;<ref name="Kirk-xxii"/> the American author [[Joyce Carol Oates]] hailed the publication as a "genuine literary event". Hughes faced criticism for his role in handling the journals: he claims to have destroyed Plath's last journal, which contained entries from the winter of 1962 up to her death. In the foreword of the 1982 version, he writes, "I destroyed [the last of her journals] because I did not want her children to have to read it (in those days I regarded forgetfulness as an essential part of survival)."<ref name="ODNB"/><ref name="WML">Wagner-Martin (1988) p. 313</ref>

As Hughes and Plath were legally married at the time of her death, Hughes inherited the Plath estate, including all her written work.

Radical feminist poet [[Robin Morgan]] published the poem "Arraignment", in which she openly accused Hughes of the battery and murder of Plath.

In 1989, with Hughes under public attack, a battle raged in the letters pages of ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Independent]]''. In ''The Guardian'' on April 20, 1989, Hughes wrote the article "The Place Where Sylvia Plath Should Rest in Peace": "In the years soon after [Plath's] death, when scholars approached me, I tried to take their apparently serious concern for the truth about Sylvia Plath seriously. But I learned my lesson early. [...] If I tried too hard to tell them exactly how something happened, in the hope of correcting some fantasy, I was quite likely to be accused of trying to suppress Free Speech. In general, my refusal to have anything to do with the Plath Fantasia has been regarded as an attempt to suppress Free Speech [...] The Fantasia about Sylvia Plath is more needed than the facts. Where that leaves respect for the truth of her life (and of mine), or for her memory, or for the literary tradition, I do not know."<ref name="Badia-Phegley-2005"/><ref>{{cite news |last=Hughes |first=Ted |date=April 20, 1989 |title=The Place Where Sylvia Plath Should Rest in Peace |location=London |work=The Guardian}}</ref>

Still the subject of speculation and opprobrium in 1998, Hughes published ''[[Birthday Letters]]'' that year, his own collection of 88 poems about his relationship with Plath. Hughes had published very little about his experience of the marriage and Plath's subsequent suicide, and the book caused a sensation, being taken as his first explicit disclosure, and it topped best seller charts. It was not known at the volume's release that Hughes was suffering from terminal cancer and would die later that year. The book went on to win the [[Forward Poetry Prize]], the [[T. S. Eliot Prize]] for Poetry, and the [[Whitbread Prize|Whitbread Poetry Prize]]. The poems, written after Plath's death, in some cases long after, try to find a reason why Plath took her own life.<ref>{{cite news |last=Rose |first=Jacqueline |date=February 1, 1998 |title=The happy couple |location=London |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/1998/feb/01/poetry.tedhughes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312080214/https://www.theguardian.com/books/1998/feb/01/poetry.tedhughes |archive-date=March 12, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Sylvia Plath's early poems exhibit what became her typical imagery, using personal and nature-based depictions featuring, for example, the moon, blood, hospitals, fetuses, and skulls. They were mostly imitation exercises of poets she admired such as [[Dylan Thomas]], [[W. B. Yeats]] and [[Marianne Moore]].<ref name="Stevenson-1994"/> Late in 1959, when she and Hughes were at the Yaddo writers' colony in New York State, she wrote the seven-part "Poem for a Birthday", echoing [[Theodore Roethke]]'s ''Lost Son'' sequence, though its theme is her own traumatic breakdown and suicide attempt at 20. After 1960 her work moved into a more surreal landscape darkened by a sense of imprisonment and looming death, overshadowed by her father. ''The Colossus'' is shot through with themes of death, redemption and resurrection. After Hughes left, Plath produced, in less than two months, the 40 poems of rage, despair, love, and vengeance on which her reputation mostly rests.<ref name="Stevenson-1994"/>

Plath's landscape poetry, which she wrote throughout her life, has been described as "a rich and important area of her work that is often overlooked ... some of the best of which was written about the [[North York Moors|Yorkshire moors]]." Her September 1961 poem "Wuthering Heights" takes its title from the [[Emily Brontë]] novel, but its content and style is Plath's own particular vision of the [[Pennines|Pennine]] landscape.<ref>{{cite web |title=A Poet's Guide to Britain: Sylvia Plath |date=May 11, 2009 |work=[[BBC]] |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00kfc1f |access-date=July 31, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901081412/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00kfc1f |archive-date=September 1, 2013 }}</ref>

It was Plath's publication of ''Ariel'' in 1965 that precipitated her rise to fame. As soon as it was published, critics began to see the collection as the charting of Plath's increasing desperation or death wish. Her dramatic death became her most famous aspect, and remains so.<ref name="ODNB"/> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' both reviewed the slim volume of ''Ariel'' in the wake of her death.<ref name="Feinmann-1993"/> The critic at ''Time'' said: "Within a week of her death, intellectual London was hunched over copies of a strange and terrible poem she had written during her last sick slide toward suicide. 'Daddy' was its title; its subject was her morbid love-hatred of her father; its style was as brutal as a truncheon. What is more, 'Daddy' was merely the first jet of flame from a literary dragon who in the last months of her life breathed a burning river of bile across the literary landscape. [...] In her most ferocious poems, 'Daddy' and 'Lady Lazarus,' fear, hate, love, death and the poet's own identity become fused at black heat with the figure of her father, and through him, with the guilt of the German exterminators and the suffering of their Jewish victims.

Some in the feminist movement saw Plath as speaking for their experience, as a "symbol of blighted female genius."<ref name="Feinmann-1993"/> Writer [[Honor Moore]] describes ''Ariel'' as marking the beginning of a movement, Plath suddenly visible as "a woman on paper", certain and audacious. Moore says: "When Sylvia Plath's ''Ariel'' was published in the United States in 1966, American women noticed. Not only women who ordinarily read poems, but housewives and mothers whose ambitions had awakened [...] Here was a woman, superbly trained in her craft, whose final poems uncompromisingly charted female rage, ambivalence, and grief, in a voice with which many women identified."<ref>{{cite web |last=Moore |first=Honor |date=March<!--/April--> 2009 |title=After ''Ariel'': Celebrating the poetry of the women's movement |work=[[Boston Review]] |url=http://bostonreview.net/archives/BR34.2/moore.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711213731/http://bostonreview.net/archives/BR34.2/moore.php |archive-date=July 11, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> Some feminists threatened to kill Hughes in Plath's name.<ref name="Feinmann-1993"/>

<blockquote>
I have never before learned anything from a poetic reading, unless the clothes, the beard, the girls, the poor or good condition of the poet can be considered a kind of knowledge. But I was taken aback by Sylvia Plath’s reading. It was not anything like I could have imagined. Not a trace of the modest, retreating, humorous Worcester, Massachusetts, of [[Elizabeth Bishop]]; nothing of the swallowed plain Pennsylvania of [[Marianne Moore]]. Instead these bitter poems—"Daddy," "Lady Lazarus," "The Applicant," "Fever 103°"—were beautifully read, projected in full-throated, plump, diction-perfect, Englishy, mesmerizing cadences, all round and rapid, and paced and spaced. Poor recessive Massachusetts had been erased. "I have done it again!" Clearly, perfectly, staring you down. She seemed to be standing at a banquet like [[Timon of Athens|Timon]], crying, "Uncover, dogs, and lap!"<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Malcolm|first=Janet|title=The Mystery of Sylvia Plath|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1993/08/23/the-silent-woman-i-ii-iii|access-date=January 28, 2021|magazine=The New Yorker|date=August 15, 1993|language=en-us}}</ref>

To imagine the body, head in oven,

To fill the mouth of their monster,
Their Sylvia Suicide Doll
