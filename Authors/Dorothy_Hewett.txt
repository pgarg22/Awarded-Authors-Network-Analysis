'''Dorothy Coade Hewett''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AM}} (21 May 1923 â€“ 25 August 2002) was an [[Australia]]n [[List of feminist poets|feminist poet]], [[novelist]] and [[playwright]]. She has been called "one of Australia's best-loved and most respected writers".<ref>Birns & McNeer.''A Companion to Australian Literature Since 1900'', Camden House, 2007</ref> She was also a member of the [[Communist Party of Australia|Communist Party]] for a period, though she clashed on many occasions with the party leadership. In recognition of her 20 volumes of published literature, she received the [[Order of Australia]], has a Writer's Walk plaque at [[Circular Quay]], and a street named for her in [[Canberra]]. The Dorothy Hewett Award for an unpublished manuscript was established in 2015 by [[UWA Publishing]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Dorothy Hewett Award for an Unpublished Manuscript|url=https://uwap.uwa.edu.au/pages/the-dorothy-hewett-award-for-an-unpublished-manuscript|website=UWA Publishing|access-date=16 July 2017}}</ref> She was a recipient of the [[Christopher Brennan Award]].

==Early life==
Hewett was born in [[Perth]], Western Australia and was brought up on a sheep and wheat farm near [[Wickepin, Western Australia|Wickepin]] in the Western Australian [[Wheatbelt (Western Australia)|Wheatbelt]]. {{Cn|date=November 2021}} She was initially educated at home and through [[Distance education|correspondence courses]]. From the age of 15 she attended [[Perth College, Western Australia|Perth College]], which was run by [[Anglican religious order|Anglican nuns]]. Hewett was an [[atheism|atheist]], remaining so all her life. {{Cn|date=November 2021}}

In 1944 Hewett began studying English at the [[University of Western Australia]] (UWA). It was here that she joined the [[Communist Party of Australia]] (CPA) in 1946 and began writing most of ''The Workers Star'', the WA Communist newspaper, under assumed names. Also during her time at UWA she won a major drama competition and a national poetry competition.{{Cn|date=November 2021}}

In 1944 she married communist lawyer Lloyd Davies and had a son who died of leukaemia at age three. The marriage ended in 1948, following Hewett's departure to Sydney to live with Les Flood, a boilermaker, with whom she had three sons, Joe, Michael and Tom, over five years.  During this period Hewett wrote mostly journalism under pseudonyms for the Communist paper, ''[[Tribune (Australian newspaper)|Tribune]]'' (the [[Menzies government]] had made it illegal), however the time she spent working in a spinning mill and volunteering for the CPA did inform many of her later works.<ref>http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/5639669</ref>

==Career==
Following the end of this relationship in 1958 Hewett returned to Perth to take up a teaching post in the English department at UWA. This move also inspired her to begin writing again. ''Jeannie'' (1958) was the first piece she completed following her enforced hiatus; Hewett later admitted to finding this a rejuvenating experience. {{Cn|date=November 2021}}

Hewett published her first novel, ''Bobbin Up'', in 1959. As the title suggests it was a semi-autobiographical work based on her time in Sydney, the novel was a [[cathartic]] work for Hewett. The novel is widely regarded as a classic example of [[social realism]]. It was one of the few western works that was translated into Russian during the Soviet era. [[Vulgar Press]] re-published the book in 1999, 40 years after its first publication.{{Cn|date=November 2021}}

In 1960 Hewett married Merv Lilley (1919-2016), and the marriage would last until the end of her life.  They had two daughters, [[Kate Lilley|Kate]] and Rose in 1960 and, in 1961 the couple published a joint collection of poetry entitled ''What About the People!''.

In 1967 Hewett's increasing disillusionment with Communist politics was evidenced by her collection ''Hidden Journey''. Things came to a head for her on 20 August 1968, when [[Warsaw Pact]] forces led by the [[Soviet Army]] brutally suppressed the [[Prague Spring]] in [[Czechoslovakia]]. She renounced her membership of the CPA. This and her critical obituary of the Communist novelist [[Katharine Susannah Prichard]] caused several Communist writers to circulate material attacking her.{{Cn|date=November 2021}}

In 1973 Hewett was awarded one of the first fellowships by the newly formed [[Australia Council]]. The organisation granted her several fellowships, and later awarded her a lifetime emeritus fellowship. Hewett returned to Sydney that year with the hope that this move would further her career as a playwright. During her life she wrote 15 plays, the most famous of which are ''This Old Man Comes Rolling Home'' (1967), ''The Chapel Perilous'' (1972), and ''The Golden Oldies'' (1981).  Several plays, such as ''The Man From Mukinupin'' (1979), were written in collaboration with Australian composer [[Jim Cotter (composer)|Jim Cotter]].<ref>Fitzpatrick P [http://www.australianmusicals.com/articles_whosturnisittoshout.html Who's Turn Is It To Shout?], AustralianMusicals, 2001</ref>

In 1975, she published a controversial collection of poems, ''Rapunzel in Suburbia'', which resulted in the pursuit of successful libel action<ref>Dimond J and Kirkpatrick P ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=iLkHvBvATW0C&pg=PA130&lpg=PA130&dq=%22Rapunzel+in+Suburbia%22+libel&source=bl&ots=tpkxm0EFWV&sig=Khr9mD4u1QWoB21iMSdt6liAKAY&hl=en&ei=ckESSrCwJMuUkAWitamPDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2#PPA130,M1 Literary Sydney: A walking guide]'' Univ. of Queensland Press, 2000. 193 pp.

Hewett was appointed a [[Member of the Order of Australia]] (AM) in the 1986 Australia Day Honours for service to literature.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://honours.pmc.gov.au/honours/awards/870127|title=Dorothy Coade Hewett|website=honours.pmc.gov.au|access-date=2019-06-14}}</ref>

[[Virago Press]] published the first volume of her autobiography, ''Wild Card'', in 1990. The book dealt with her lifelong quest for sexual freedom and the negative responses she received from those around her. Two years later she published her second novel, ''The Toucher''.

In 1990 a painting of Hewett by artist [[Geoffrey Proud]] won the [[Archibald Prize]], Australia's most prominent portrait prize.

==Later years==
{{Unreferencedsect|date=November 2021}}
Hewett moved to [[Faulconbridge, New South Wales|Faulconbridge]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]], west of Sydney, with her husband Merv Lilley in 1991. She suffered from [[osteoarthritis]] but continued to write prolifically, including a novel, ''Neap Tide'' (Penguin 1999), a collection of poetry, ''Halfway Up The Mountain'', a play commissioned by the [[Playbox Theatre Company, Australia|Playbox Theatre]] in [[Melbourne]], ''Nowhere'', and other unpublished works. At the time of her death, from breast cancer, she was working on the second volume of her autobiography, ''The Empty Room''.

== Controversy ==
In June 2018, Hewett's daughters, Kate and Rozanna Lilley, alleged that they had been sexually assaulted as teenagers by writer and journalist [[Bob_Ellis| Bob Ellis]], artist [[Martin Sharp]], and other men on several occasions, with their mother's approval.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-06-21/dorothy-hewett-daughters-sexual-assault-allegations-metoo/9893834|access-date=2019-06-19|date=2018-06-21|title=Dorothy Hewett's daughters Rozanna and Kate Lilley talk about re-casting their mum's image in the age of #MeToo|website=abc.net.au}}</ref>
