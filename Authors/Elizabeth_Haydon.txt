{{Main|The Symphony of Ages}}
The Symphony of Ages books series consists of the ''Rhapsody Trilogy'', the two ''Middle Books'', and, as of June 2015, ''The War of the Known World Trilogy''. The third book in this trilogy, and thus the eighth in the Symphony of Ages series, was published in June 2015.

==== The Rhapsody Trilogy ====
The Rhapsody Trilogy is based on three characters who find themselves in a land on the brink of disaster.  Rhapsody, the main character, is a Namer, a profession that includes passing down the history and lore of the people and the land. As a Namer, Rhapsody, can only speak the truth. A Namer has incredible power because when they speak (or sing) they describe the very nature or essence of a person or a thing. In some instances a Namer can change the parameters of a person or a thing by giving it a new name. When Rhapsody meets up with her two future companions she accidentally uses her Naming power to rename The Brother, a ruthless assassin, to "Achmed The Snake." This accident forces Rhapsody to join Achmed and his companion who are on the run from an ancient and dangerous foe, a F'Dor demon.
