''Supernatural Fiction Writers: Contemporary Fantasy and Horror''. New York: Thomson/Gale, 2003. (pp. 89-98) {{ISBN|9780684312507}}</ref>  He is noted for a distinctive, humorous style, as well as being one of the pioneers of the [[steampunk]] genre of science fiction.

Wells]], [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] and [[Charles Dickens]] as his inspirations.<ref name="geek">{{cite web|url=http://www.thegeekgirlproject.com/2013/05/23/interview-with-james-p-blaylock/|title=Interview with Steampunk Legend Author James P. Blaylock|website=The Geek Girl Project|date=23 May 2013}}</ref>

He was born in [[Long Beach, California]]; studied English at [[California State University, Fullerton]], receiving an M.A. in 1974; and lives in [[Orange, California]], teaching creative writing at [[Chapman University]]. He taught at the Orange County School of the arts until 2013. Many of his books are set in [[Orange County, California]], and can more specifically be termed "fabulism"{{spaced ndash}}that is, fantastic things happen in our present-day world, rather than in traditional fantasy, where the setting is often some other world. His works have also been categorized as [[magic realism]].

He and his friends [[Tim Powers]] and [[K. W. Jeter]] were mentored by [[Philip K. Dick]]. Along with Powers, Blaylock invented the poet [[William Ashbless]]. Blaylock and Powers have often collaborated with each other on writing stories, including "The Better Boy", "On Pirates", and "The William Ashbless Memorial Cookbook".

Blaylock previously served as director of the Creative Writing Conservatory at the [[Orange County High School of the Arts]] until 2013, where Powers has also been Writer in Residence.<ref name="geek" /><ref>{{Citation
