'''Clemence Dane''' was the pseudonym of '''Winifred Ashton''' (21 February 1888 – 28 March 1965), an English novelist and playwright.

==Life and career==

After completing her education, Dane went to Switzerland to work as a French tutor, but returned home after a year. She studied art in London and Germany. After the [[First World War]], she taught at a girls' school and began writing. She took the pseudonym "Clemence Dane" from the church, [[St Clement Danes]] on the [[Strand, London]].

Her first novel, ''[[Regiment of Women]],'' written in 1917, was a study of life in a girls' school.<ref name="ca">[[Michael Cox (novelist)|Michael Cox]] and Jack Adrian, ''The Oxford Book of Historical Stories''. Oxford;[[Oxford University Press]], 1994. {{ISBN|9780192142191}} (p.436).</ref>  In 1919 she wrote ''Legend'', the story of a group of acquaintances who debate the meaning of a dead friend's life and work. Dane's 1921 play, ''[[A Bill of Divorcement (play)|A Bill of Divorcement]]'', tells the story of a daughter who cares for her deranged father and faces the fact that his mental illness may be hereditary.  The smash hit play was adapted for the screen three times, using the same title as the play:  a [[A Bill of Divorcement (1922 film)|silent film in 1922]], a [[A Bill of Divorcement (1932 film)|1932 film]] starring [[Katharine Hepburn]] and [[John Barrymore]], and  [[A Bill of Divorcement (1940 film)|a 1940 film]] starring [[Maureen O'Hara|Maureen O’Hara]] and [[Adolphe Menjou]].

Dane began writing screenplays as well as novels. She co-wrote the screenplay for ''[[Anna Karenina (1935 film)|Anna Karenina]], s''tarring [[Greta Garbo]]. The pinnacle of Dane's success was winning an [[Academy Award]] with [[Anthony Pelissier]] for the film ''Vacation from Marriage'', released in the United Kingdom as ''[[Perfect Strangers (1945 film)|Perfect Strangers]]'', starring [[Robert Donat]] and [[Deborah Kerr]] as a married couple transformed by their experiences in the Second World War.

Dane, at the age of 30, was one of women eligible to vote for the first time under the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]]. Her opinions on ''The Women's Side'' <ref>Clemence Dane, ''The Women's Side''. London : Herbert Jenkins Ltd, 1926.</ref> were published in 1926 and she argued that women should do more with their freedom. She compared the modern girl's choice with the popular gambling card game Speculation in [[Jane Austen]]'s [[Mansfield Park]].<ref>Alexis Weedon, "Women suffrage and Clemence Dane" in  Nicola Darwood, W.R. Owens and Alexis Weedon (ed.), ''Fiction and 'The Woman Question' from 1860 to 1930''. [[Cambridge Scholars Publishing]], 2020 {{ISBN|1-5275-5041-9}}  (p. 124-5).</ref> She wrote for ''[[Time and Tide (magazine)|Time and Tide]]'' and was a member of the [[Six Point Group]].<ref>Weedon, "Women suffrage and Clemence Dane" (p. 123).</ref>

Dane's 1931 novel ''[[Broome Stages]]'' followed the fortunes of an acting family from the time of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] to the present. ''Broome Stages'' became a surprise bestseller.<ref name="ca" /> 
Dane and [[Helen de Guerry Simpson]] wrote three detective novels featuring their creation, Sir John Saumarez. Both were members of the [[Detection Club]].  The first novel, ''[[Enter Sir John]]'', was filmed by [[Alfred Hitchcock]] in 1930 as ''[[Murder!]]''.  Dane contributed to the Club's serials ''[[The Scoop and Behind the Screen|The Scoop]]'' and ''[[The Floating Admiral]]''. Dane's '' The Arrogant History of White Ben'' (1939) is a [[dystopia]]n novel set in a politically unstable near future.<ref>Jenny Hartley, "Clothes and Uniform and the Theatre of Fascism: Clemence Dane and Virginia Woolf" in  Angela Smith (ed.), ''Gender and warfare in the twentieth century: textual representations''. [[Manchester University Press]], 2004 {{ISBN|0-7190-6574-7}}  (p. 97).</ref>

Dane's last play, ''[[Eighty in the Shade]]'' (1959) was written for and starred her friend, [[Dame Sybil Thorndike]]. Dane is believed to be the template for the character Madame Arcati, the eccentric medium in her friend [[Noël Coward]]'s play, ''[[Blithe Spirit (play)|Blithe Spirit]]''. The [[National Portrait Gallery (United Kingdom)|National Portrait Gallery]] contains two works by Dane, both of Coward. One is an oil painting and the other is a bronze bust. The gallery also contains a portrait of Dane by [[Frederic Yates]].

According to [[Arthur Marshall (broadcaster)|Arthur Marshall]], she was famous for her indecent, though entirely innocent, remarks. "The physical side of life had passed her by, together with the words, slang and otherwise, that accompany it. Time and again she settled for an unfortunate word or phrase. Inviting Noël Coward to lunch during the war, when food was difficult, she boomed encouragement down the telephone; 'Do come! I've got such a lovely cock.' ('I do wish you'd call it a hen', Noel answered). To use correctly, in a literary sense, the words 'erection', 'tool' and 'spunk' was second nature to her. When wishing to describe herself as being full of life and creative energy, she chose, not really very wisely, the word 'randy'."<ref>Arthur Marshall, ''Life's Rich Pageant'' p 103-104 {{ISBN|0-241-11306-7}}</ref>

In 1955, Dane edited the ''Novels of Tomorrow'' series for publisher [[Michael Joseph (publisher)|Michael Joseph]]. This was a series of science fiction novels featuring such authors as [[John Wyndham]], [[Robert Sheckley]], and [[Cyril M. Kornbluth]].<ref>Mark Rich, ''C.M. Kornbluth : the life and works of a science fiction visionary''. Jefferson, N.C. : McFarland & Co., 2010. {{ISBN|9780786443932}} (p. 272).</ref>

Dane also wrote a book on the history of [[Covent Garden]] (where she lived for a number of years) titled ''London has a Garden and'' published in 1964.

By the time of her death in London, on 28 March 1965, Dane had written more than 30 plays and 16 novels.
