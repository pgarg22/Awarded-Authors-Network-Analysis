{{eastern name order|Márai Sándor}}
'''{{lang|hu|Sándor Márai}}''' [{{IPA|ˈʃaːndor ˈmaːrɒi}}] (originally ''Sándor Károly Henrik Grosschmid de Mára'', archaically English: '''Alexander Márai''';<ref>Leslie Konnyu: Modern Magyar literature: a literary survey and anthology of the xxth century Hungarian authors -PAGE: 95, Publisher: American Hungarian Review, 1964</ref> 11 April 1900 – 21 February 1989) was a [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] writer and journalist.

==Biography==
He was born in 1900 on April 11 in the city of [[Košice|Kassa]], [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (now Košice, [[Slovakia]]). Through his father, he was a relative of the [[Hungarian nobility|Hungarian noble]] Országh family. In 1919, he was an enthusiastic supporter of the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] and worked as a journalist. He joined the Communists, becoming the founder of the “Activist and Anti-National Group of Communist Writers”. After the fall of the Soviet Republic, his family found it safer to leave the country, thus he continued his studies in [[Leipzig]]. Márai travelled to and lived in [[Frankfurt]], [[Berlin]], and [[Paris]] and briefly considered writing in German, but eventually chose his mother language, [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], for his writings. In ''Egy polgár vallomásai'', Márai identifies the [[mother tongue]] language with the concept of nation itself.<ref>Márai, Sándor. "Egy polgár vallomásai." ''Akadémiai Kiadó'', Budapest, 1935.</ref> He settled in [[Krisztinaváros]], [[Budapest]], in 1928. In the 1930s, he gained prominence with a precise and clear [[Literary realism|realist]] style. He was the first person to write reviews of the work of [[Franz Kafka]].

He wrote very enthusiastically about the [[First Vienna Award|First]] and [[Second Vienna Award]]s, in which as the result of the German-Italian arbitration [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Romania]] had to give back part of the territories which Hungary lost in the [[Treaty of Trianon]]. Nevertheless, Márai was highly critical of the [[Nazism|Nazis]].

Marai authored 46 books. His 1942 book ''[[Embers (novel)|Embers]]'' (Hungarian title: ''A gyertyák csonkig égnek'', meaning "The Candles Burn Down to the Stump") expresses a nostalgia for the bygone multi-ethnic, multicultural society of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]], reminiscent of the works of [[Joseph Roth]]. In 2006 an adaptation of this novel for the stage, written by [[Christopher Hampton]], was performed in London.<ref>{{cite news|last=Billington|first=Michael|author-link=Michael_Billington_%28critic%29|title=Embers|publisher=Guardian Unlimited|date=March 2, 2006|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/reviews/story/0,,1721509,00.html|access-date=November 17, 2017|archive-date=July 18, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718234244/http://arts.guardian.co.uk/reviews/story/0,,1721509,00.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

He also disliked the [[communism|communist]] regime that seized power after [[World War II]], and left – or was driven away – in 1948. After living for some time in Italy, Márai settled in the city of San Diego, in the United States. Márai joined with [[Radio Free Europe]] between 1951-1968.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pim.hu/en/search?s=sandor+marai|title=Search &#124; Petőfi Literary Museum|website=pim.hu}}</ref> Márai was extremely disappointed in the Western powers for not helping the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hungaryfoundation.org/life-sandor-marai/|title=The Life of Sándor Márai|date=May 12, 2014|access-date=November 17, 2017}}</ref>

He continued to write in his native language, but was not published in English until the mid-1990s. Like other memoirs by Hungarian writers and statesmen, it was first published in the West, because it could not be published in the Hungary of the post-1956 [[János Kádár|Kádár]] era. The English version of the memoir was published posthumously in 1996. After his wife died in 1986, Márai retreated more and more into isolation. In 1987, he lived with advanced cancer and his depression worsened when he lost his adopted son, John. He ended his life<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/knopf/authors/marai/|title=Sándor Márai|publisher=[[Random House]]|access-date=November 17, 2017}}</ref> with a gunshot to his head in San Diego in 1989. He left behind three granddaughters; Lisa, Sarah and Jennifer Márai.

Largely forgotten outside of Hungary, his work (consisting of poems, novels, and [[diary|diaries]]) has only been recently "rediscovered" and republished in French (starting in 1992), [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], Italian, English, German, Spanish, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Urdu language|Urdu]] and other languages too, and is now considered to be part of the European Twentieth Century literary canon.
