==Biography==
Robert Holdstock, the eldest of five children, was born in [[Hythe, Kent|Hythe]], [[Kent]]. His father, Robert Frank Holdstock, was a police officer and his mother, Kathleen Madeline Holdstock, was a nurse. At the age of seven Robert started attending [[Rainham Mark Grammar School|Gillingham Grammar School]] in the [[Medway|Medway Towns]]. As a young adult he had jobs including [[banana boat (ship)|banana boatman]], [[construction worker]] and [[Slate industry in Wales|slate miner]].<ref>Holdstock, Robert ''Eye Among the Blind'' (New York: Doubleday & Company, 1976), back flap.</ref> He also earned a [[Bachelor of Science]] from [[Bangor University|University College of North Wales]], Bangor, with honours in applied [[Zoology]] (1967&ndash;1970). He continued his education, earning a [[Master of Science]] in Medical Zoology at the [[London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine]] in 1971. He conducted research at the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council in London]] from 1971 to 1974, while also doing part-time writing and producing a science fiction fanzine.

==Writing==
[[File:Lavondyss-uk-medium.jpg|left|thumb|Holdstock's fantasy novel ''[[Lavondyss]]'' with cover art by [[Alan Lee (illustrator)|Alan Lee]].]]
Robert Holdstock's first published story, "Pauper's Plot", appeared in the magazine ''[[New Worlds (magazine)|New Worlds]]'' in 1968.<ref>Moorcock, Michael ''Horror: The 100 Best Books'', eds. Jones, Stephen and Newman, Kim (New York, NY: Carrol & Graf, 1998), page 326.</ref> His first novel was a science fiction work, ''Eye Among the Blind'', published in 1976.<ref>''The Ultimate Guide to Science Fiction'', David Pringle (London: Grafton Books, 1990), page 111.</ref>

During the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s Holdstock wrote many fantasy and science fiction novels along with a number of short stories, most of which were published under a pseudonym. Robert Holdstock's pseudonyms included Robert Faulcon, Chris Carlsen, Richard Kirk, Robert Black, Ken Blake, and Steven Eisler.<ref>''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', editors John Clute and John Grant (New York, NY: St. Martin's Press, 1997), page 474.</ref> These included some adaptions of television scripts for [[novelisation]]s of television series including ''[[The Professionals (TV Series)|The Professionals]]''.<ref>Pixley, Andrew: ''The Professionals MkIV Viewing Notes'', Network, 2016. [Paperback book included with Blu-ray release]</ref> During this same period he wrote the text for ''Space Wars, Worlds and Weapons'', a large format book in which he provided essays concerning the tropes of science fiction (and, in one chapter, [[sword and sorcery]]), accompanied by colour reproductions of related artwork.

In 1980 Holdstock wrote ''Tour of the Universe'' with [[Malcolm Edwards]]. The rights were subsequently sold for a space shuttle simulation ride at the [[CN Tower]], also called the [[Tour of the Universe]].

Holdstock wrote "[[The Dark Wheel]]", the first novella to be included for distribution with a video game, ''[[Elite (video game)|Elite]]'', in 1984. He wrote an adaptation of ''[[The Emerald Forest (film)|The Emerald Forest]]'', a film directed by [[John Boorman]], and novelised episodes of the [[Granada Television]] series ''[[Bulman]]''.

Holdstock's breakthrough novel ''[[Mythago Wood]]'' was published in 1984. It began the Ryhope Wood series,<ref>Langford, David ''Supernatural Fiction Writers, Second Edition, Volume 1'', ed. [[Richard Bleiler]] (New York, NY: Charles Scribner's Sons, 2003), page 446.</ref> which continued until the appearance of ''Avilion'' in 2009.

Holdstock was guest of honour at the annual [[Novacon]] in 1984, and a limited-edition chapbook featuring his fantasy story 'Thorn' was presented to the first 500 attendees.

Between 2001 and 2007 Holdstock produced a trilogy of fantasy novels, the Merlin Codex, consisting of ''Celtika'', ''The Iron Grail'' and ''The Broken Kings''.

Holdstock wrote, edited or contributed to a number of nonfiction works, including ''Alien Landscapes'', ''Tour of the Universe'', ''Horror: 100 Best Novels'' and ''[[Encyclopedia of Science Fiction (1978 book)|Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]'' (a different publication than ''[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]'' published in 1979, edited by [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Peter Nicholls]]).

In 2013 a joint volume of poetry with [[Garry Kilworth]] (with whom he collaborated on the award-winning novella "The Ragthorn") was published by PS Publishing, ''Poems, Peoms and Other Atrocities''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Poems, Peoms and Other Atrocities|last1=Kilworth|first1=Garry|last2=Holdstock|first2=Robert|publisher=PS Publishing|year=2013|isbn=978-1848636378|series=Stanza Press}}</ref>

==Critical reception==
[[David Pringle]] described ''Eye Among the Blind'', Holdstock's first science fiction novel, as a "dogged, detailed, somewhat slow-moving planetary mystery".<ref>''The Ultimate Guide to Science Fiction'', David Pringle (London: Grafton, 1990), page 111.</ref> [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] called the same novel "As strong a treatment of a central theme of science fiction – alienness, and the relation of the human and the alien – as any I have read."<ref>''The Ultimate Guide to Science Fiction'', David Pringle (London: Grafton, 1990), page 111.</ref>

According to [[Michael D. C. Drout]], Holdstock's Ryhope Wood series is a significant part of the fantasy genre, displaying the power and aesthetic standards of Tolkien's fantasy without being either a "close imitation of" or a "reaction against" Tolkien. Drout considers Holdstock, along with Ursula K. Le Guin, a worthy inheritor of the fantasy tradition created by Tolkien.<ref>[[Michael D. C. Drout|Drout, Michael D.C.]] ''Of Sorcerers and Men: Tolkien and the Roots of Modern Fantasy Literature'', China: Barnes & Noble Publishing, 2006, page 56.</ref> [[Patrick Curry (author)|Patrick Curry]] placed Holdstock in a quartet of noteworthy fantasy authors, alongside Le Guin, [[John Crowley (author)|John Crowley]] and [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]], for writing fantasy books that come close to Tolkien's breadth and depth of imagination, and "in some respects surpass Tolkien".<ref>Curry, Patrick ''Defending Middle-Earth: Tolkien: Myth and Modernity'', New York, NY: Houghton Mifflin, 2004, pages 132–133</ref>

[[David Langford]] offers praise for most of Holdstock's work, but regarded ''[[Merlin's Wood]]'' less highly: "the overall narrative is flawed, distorted by its weight of undeserved loss and inaccessible healing".<ref>Langford, David ''Supernatural Fiction Writers, Second Edition, Volume 1'', ed. Richard Bleiler (New York, NY: Charles Scribner's Sons, 2003), page 450.</ref>

==Book covers==
The covers of Holdstock's books were produced by a variety of [[illustrator]]s. The original UK and US covers of ''Mythago Wood'' were illustrated by Eddi Gornall and Christopher Zacharow, respectively; [[Geoff Taylor (illustrator)|Geoff Taylor]] illustrated the original UK covers for the ''Mythago Wood'' sequels ''Lavondyss'', ''The Bone Forest'', ''The Hollowing'' and ''Merlin's Wood''. Illustrators of subsequent covers and editions include [[Jim Burns]], Tom Canty, [[John Howe (illustrator)|John Howe]], [[Alan Lee (illustrator)|Alan Lee]], [[John Jude Palencar]], Larry Rostant and Ron Walotsky. John Howe stated: "Holdstock is to me one of the best Celtic fantasy authors alive today."<ref>Jude, Dick ''Fantasy Art Masters: The Best Fantasy and Science Fiction Artists and How They Work'', London: HarperCollins, 1999, page 43.</ref>
