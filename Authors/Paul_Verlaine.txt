'''Paul-Marie Verlaine''' ({{IPAc-en|v|ɛər|ˈ|l|ɛ|n}};<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/verlaine "Verlaine"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.</ref> {{IPA-fr|vɛʁlɛn(ə)|lang}}; 30 March 1844 – 8 January 1896) was a [[French poet]] associated with the [[Symbolist]] movement and the [[Decadent movement]]. He is considered one of the greatest representatives of the ''[[fin de siècle]]'' in international and [[French poetry]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born in [[Metz]], Verlaine was educated at the ''Lycée Impérial Bonaparte'' (now the [[Lycée Condorcet]]) in Paris and then took up a post in the [[civil service]]. He began writing poetry at an early age, and was initially influenced by the [[Parnassien]] movement and its leader, [[Leconte de Lisle]]. Verlaine's first published poem was published in 1863 in ''La Revue du progrès'', a publication founded by poet [[Louis-Xavier de Ricard]]. Verlaine was a frequenter of the salon of the Marquise de Ricard<ref>Shapiro, Norman R., ''One Hundred and One Poems by Paul Verlaine'', University of Chicago Press, 1999</ref> (Louis-Xavier de Ricard's mother) at 10 Boulevard des Batignolles and other social venues, where he rubbed shoulders with prominent artistic figures of the day: [[Anatole France]], [[Emmanuel Chabrier]], inventor-poet and humorist [[Charles Cros]], the cynical anti-bourgeois idealist [[Villiers de l'Isle-Adam]], [[Théodore de Banville]], [[François Coppée]], [[Jose-Maria de Heredia]], Leconte de Lisle, [[Catulle Mendes]] and others. Verlaine's first published collection, ''[[Poèmes saturniens]]'' (1866),<ref name=litweb>{{cite web |url=http://www.litweb.net/biography/425/Paul_Verlaine.html |title=Paul Verlaine |work=Litweb.net |access-date=2007-07-18 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070807234605/http://www.litweb.net/biography/425/Paul_Verlaine.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 7 August 2007}}</ref> though adversely commented upon by [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve|Sainte-Beuve]], established him as a poet of promise and originality.

===Marriage and military service===
Mathilde Mauté became Verlaine's wife in 1870. At the proclamation of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] in the same year, Verlaine joined the 160th battalion of the ''[[National Guard (France)|Garde nationale]]'', turning [[Communards|Communard]] on 18 March 1871.

Verlaine became head of the press bureau of the Central Committee of the [[Paris Commune]]. Verlaine escaped the deadly street fighting known as the Bloody Week, or ''[[Semaine Sanglante]]'', and went into hiding in the Pas-de-Calais.{{Citation needed|date=December 2020}}

===Relationships with Rimbaud and Létinois===
[[File:Arthur Rimbaud plaque.JPG|thumb|right|Plaque in [[Brussels]]]]
[[File:Paul Verlaine.jpeg|thumb|Paul Verlaine in 1893; photograph by [[Otto Wegener]]]]
Verlaine returned to Paris in August 1871, and, in September, received the first letter from [[Arthur Rimbaud]], who admired his poetry. Verlaine urged Rimbaud to come to Paris, and by 1872, he had lost interest in Mathilde, and effectively abandoned her and their son, preferring the company of his new lover.<ref name=litweb /> Rimbaud and Verlaine's stormy affair took them to London in 1872. In Brussels in July 1873, in a drunken, jealous rage, he fired two shots with a pistol at Rimbaud, wounding his left wrist, though not seriously injuring the poet. As an indirect result of this incident, Verlaine was arrested and imprisoned at [[Mons]],<ref>{{Cite news|last=Willsher|first=Kim|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/18/paul-verlaine-new-exhibition-mons|title=How 555 nights in jail helped to make Paul Verlaine a 'prince of poets'|date=2015-10-17|work=The Observer|access-date=2020-03-31|language=en-GB|issn=0029-7712}}</ref> where he underwent a re-conversion to [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], which again influenced his work and provoked Rimbaud's sharp criticism.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hanson, Ellis.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/502187924|title=Decadence and Catholicism.|date=1998|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-19444-6|oclc=502187924}}</ref>

The poems collected in ''Romances sans paroles'' (1874) were written between 1872 and 1873, inspired by Verlaine's nostalgically colored recollections of his life with Mathilde on the one hand and impressionistic sketches of his on-again off-again year-long escapade with Rimbaud on the other. ''Romances sans paroles'' was published while Verlaine was imprisoned. Following his release from prison, Verlaine again traveled to England, where he worked for some years as a teacher, teaching French, Latin, Greek and drawing at [[William Lovell Church of England Academy|William Lovell's school]] in [[Stickney, Lincolnshire|Stickney]] in Lincolnshire.<ref>{{cite web

Verlaine returned to France in 1877 and, while teaching English at a school in [[Rethel]], fell in love with one of his pupils, Lucien Létinois, who inspired Verlaine to write further poems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lucien-Letinois|title=Lucien Létinois {{!}} French author|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Verlaine was devastated when Létinois died of [[typhus]] in 1883.

===Final years===
[[File:Erected_in_1911_is_a_bust_monument_to_Verlaine,_sculpted_by_Auguste_Rodo,_in_the_Luxembourg_Gardens.jpg|thumb|right|Monument to Paul Verlaine, sculpted by [[Rodo]] in 1911, in the Luxembourg Gardens, Paris]]
[[Image:Sépulture de Paul Verlaine.jpg|thumb|right|Grave.]]
Verlaine's last years saw his descent into [[drug addiction]], [[alcoholism]], and poverty. He lived in slums and public hospitals, and spent his days drinking [[absinthe]] in Paris cafés. However, the people's love for his art resurrected support and brought in an income for Verlaine: his early poetry was rediscovered, his lifestyle and strange behaviour in front of crowds attracted admiration, and in 1894 he was elected France's "Prince of Poets" by his peers.

Verlaine's poetry was admired and recognized as ground-breaking, and served as a source of inspiration to composers. [[Gabriel Fauré]] composed many [[mélodie]]s, such as the [[song cycle]]s ''[[Cinq mélodies "de Venise"]]'' and ''[[La bonne chanson (Fauré)|La bonne chanson]]'', which were settings of Verlaine's poems.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Orledge | first=Robert | title=Gabriel Fauré | publisher=Eulenburg Books | location=London | year=1979 | page=[https://archive.org/details/gabrielfaur0000orle/page/78 78] | isbn=0-903873-40-0 | url=https://archive.org/details/gabrielfaur0000orle/page/78 }}</ref> [[Claude Debussy]] set to music  ''[[Clair de lune (poem)|Clair de lune]]'' and six of the ''Fêtes galantes'' poems, forming part of the ''mélodie'' collection known as the ''Recueil Vasnier''; he also made another setting of ''Clair de lune'', and the poem inspired his [[Suite bergamasque]].<ref name="Forgotten Songs CD">Rolf, Marie. Page 7 of liner notes to ''Forgotten Songs'' by [[Claude Debussy]], with [[Dawn Upshaw]] and [[James Levine]], Sony SK 67190.</ref> [[Reynaldo Hahn]] set several of Verlaine's poems as did the Belgian-British composer [[Poldowski]] (daughter of [[Henryk Wieniawski]]), and German composer [[Anna Teichmüller]].

Verlaine's drug dependence and alcoholism took a toll on his life. He died in Paris at the age of 51 on 8 January 1896; he was buried in the [[Cimetière des Batignolles]] (he was first buried in the 20th division, but his grave was moved to the 11th division—on the roundabout, a much better location—when the [[Boulevard Périphérique]] was built).<ref>Wilson, Scott.

A bust monument to Verlaine sculpted by [[Rodo]] was erected in 1911. It sits in the [[jardin du Luxembourg|Luxembourg Gardens]] in Paris.

==Style==
[[File:Paul Verlaine.jpg|thumb|250px|<center>Verlaine drinking [[absinthe]] in the Café François 1er in 1892, photographed by Paul Marsan [[Dornac]]</center>]]
Much of the [[French poetry]] produced during the ''[[fin de siècle]]'' was characterized as "[[Decadent movement|decadent]]" for its lurid content or moral vision. In a similar vein, Verlaine used the expression ''[[poète maudit]]'' ("cursed poet") in 1884 to refer to a number of poets like [[Stéphane Mallarmé]], [[Arthur Rimbaud]], [[Aloysius Bertrand]], [[Comte de Lautréamont]], [[Tristan Corbière]] or [[Alice de Chambrier]], who had fought against poetic conventions and suffered social rebuke, or were ignored by the critics. But with the publication of [[Jean Moréas]]' ''[[Symbolist Manifesto]]'' in 1886, it was the term [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] which was most often applied to the new literary environment. Along with Verlaine, Mallarmé, Rimbaud, [[Paul Valéry]], [[Albert Samain]] and many others began to be referred to as "Symbolists." These poets would often share themes that parallel [[Schopenhauer's aesthetics]] and notions of will, fatality and [[Unconscious mind|unconscious forces]], and used themes of sex (such as [[Prostitution|prostitutes]]), the city, irrational phenomena ([[delirium]], dreams, [[narcotic]]s, alcohol), and sometimes a vaguely [[Middle Ages|medieval]] setting.

In poetry, the symbolist procedure—as typified by Verlaine—was to use subtle suggestion instead of precise statement ([[rhetoric]] was banned) and to evoke moods and feelings through the magic of words and repeated sounds and the cadence of verse (musicality) and [[Meter (poetry)|metrical]] innovation.

Verlaine described his typically decadent style in great detail in his poem "Art Poétique," describing the primacy of musicality and the importance of elusiveness and "the Odd."  He spoke of veils and nuance and implored poets to "Keep away from the murderous Sharp Saying, Cruel Wit, and Impure Laugh."  It is with these lyrical veils in mind that Verlaine concluded by suggesting that a poem should be a "happy occurrence."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aestheticrealism.net/poetry/art-poetique.htm|title=Art Poétique|last=Verlane|first=Paul|date=1882|website=Aesthetic Realism Online Library|others=Translated by Eli Siegel (1968)|access-date=18 February 2017}}</ref>

* In preparation for [[Operation Overlord]], the [[BBC]] via [[Radio Londres]] had signaled to the [[French Resistance]] that the opening lines of the 1866 Verlaine poem "[[Chanson d'automne]]" were to indicate the start of D-Day operations. The first three lines of the poem, "''Les sanglots longs'' / ''Des violons'' / ''De l'automne''" ("Long sobs of autumn violins"), meant that Operation Overlord was to start within two weeks. These lines were broadcast on 1 June 1944.

==In popular culture==
* Among the admirers of Verlaine's work was the [[Russian language]] poet and novelist [[Boris Pasternak]]. Pasternak went so far as to translate much of Verlaine's verse into Russian. According to Pasternak's [[mistress (lover)|mistress]] and [[muse]], [[Olga Ivinskaya]], <blockquote>Whenever [Boris Leonidovich] was provided with literal versions of things which echoed his own thoughts or feelings, it made all the difference and he worked feverishly, turning them into masterpieces. I remember his translating Paul Verlaine in a burst of enthusiasm like this -- ''[http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Art_po%C3%A9tique_(Verlaine) L'Art poétique]'' was after all an expression of his own beliefs about poetry.<ref>Olga Ivinskaya, ''A Captive of Time: My Years with Boris Pasternak'', (1978).

* Composer [[Lyubov Streicher]] (1888-1958) set Verlaine’s text to music in her ''Romances''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cohen|first=Aaron I.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WeJB2s2SqcUC&newbks=0&printsec=frontcover&dq=lyubov+streicher&q=lyubov+streicher&hl=en|title=International Encyclopedia of Women Composers|date=1987|publisher=Books & Music USA|isbn=978-0-9617485-1-7|language=en}}</ref>

* His relationship with Rimbaud was dramatised in the 1964 Australian TV play ''[[A Season in Hell (1964 film)|A Season in Hell]]''.
* In 1964, French singer [[Léo Ferré]] set to music fourteen poems from Verlaine and some from Rimbaud for his album ''[[Verlaine et Rimbaud]]''. He also sang two other poems (''Colloque sentimental'', ''Si tu ne mourus pas'') in his album ''On n'est pas sérieux quand on a dix-sept ans'' (1987).{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}
* Soviet/Russian composer [[David Tukhmanov]] set Verlaine's poem to music in Russian and French (cult album ''On a Wave of My Memory'', 1975).<ref>{{in lang|ru}} [http://popsa.info/bio/006/006b.html David Tukhmanov]</ref>
* Guitarist, singer and songwriter Tom Miller (better known as [[Tom Verlaine]], leader of the art rock band [[Television (band)|Television]]) chose his stage name as a tribute to Verlaine.
* New Zealand indie rock band [[The Verlaines]] are named after Verlaine. Their most popular song [[Death and the Maiden (The Verlaines song)|"Death and the Maiden"]] references his shooting of Rimbaud.
* The time Verlaine and Rimbaud spent together was the subject of the 1995 film ''[[Total Eclipse (film)|Total Eclipse]]'', directed by [[Agnieszka Holland]] and with a screenplay by [[Christopher Hampton]], based on his play of the same name. Verlaine was portrayed by [[David Thewlis]] and [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] played Rimbaud.
* The poem ''Crime of Love'' was set to music for the album ''[[Feasting with Panthers]]'', released in 2011 by [[Marc Almond]] and [[Michael Cashmore]]. It was adapted and translated by [[Jeremy Reed (writer)|Jeremy Reed]].
* [[Bob Dylan]]'s iconic "[[You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go]]," has the lyric, "Situations have ended sad; Relationships have all been bad; Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud".
* Singer [[Lydia Loveless]] included a song called 'Verlaine Shot Rimbaud' on her album [[Somewhere Else (Lydia Loveless album)|Somewhere Else]].

- ‘Clair de lune’ by Claude Debussy, takes its title from an atmospheric poem by the French poet Paul Verlaine which depicts the soul as somewhere full of music ‘in a minor key’ where birds are inspired to sing by the ‘sad and beautiful’ light of the moon.

==Works in English (translation)==
Although widely regarded as a major French poet—to the effect that towards the end of his life he was sobriquetted as "Le Prince des Poètes" (The Prince of Poets) in the French-speaking world—surprisingly very few of Verlaine's major works have been translated ''in their entirety'' (vs. selections therefrom) into English. Here is a list to help track those known to exist.
