He published his first collection of essays and short stories, ''[[Barrel Fever]]'', in 1994. He is the brother and writing collaborator of actor [[Amy Sedaris]].

Much of Sedaris's humor is ostensibly [[autobiography|autobiographical]] and [[self-deprecation|self-deprecating]] and often concerns his family life, his middle-class upbringing in the [[suburb]]s of [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], his [[Greek American|Greek]] heritage, [[homosexuality]], jobs, education, [[Recreational drug use|drug use]], and [[Obsessive-compulsive disorder|obsessive behaviors]], and his life in France, London, and the English [[South Downs]].

== Early life and education ==
Sedaris was born in [[Johnson City, New York]],<ref>PBS-Finding Your Roots Episode 9</ref> to Sharon Elizabeth (née Leonard) and Louis Harry "Lou" Sedaris (1923-2021), an [[IBM]] engineer.<ref name="Sharon Leonard in 'Naked'">{{cite book|title=[[Naked (book)|Naked]] |last=Sedaris |first=David |publisher=Abacus |year=2006 |edition=1 |location=London |chapter=Dix Hill |page=90}}</ref><ref name="tnr">{{cite web|url=http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=20070319&s=heard031907|title=TNR}}</ref><ref name="tnr2">{{cite web|url=http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=20070319&s=heard031907&c=2|title=TNR}}</ref> His mother was [[English American|Anglo-American]].<ref>Stated on ''[[Finding Your Roots]]'', PBS, November 18, 2014</ref> His father was born in the U.S. to immigrants from Apidea in [[Greece]].<ref name="Louis H.

The Sedaris family moved when David was young, and he grew up in a suburban area of [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], as the second child of six. His siblings, from oldest to youngest, are Lisa, Gretchen, [[Amy Sedaris|Amy]],<ref name="indmag">Lafreniere, Steve [http://www.indexmagazine.com/interviews/amy_david_sedaris.shtml "Amy and David Sedaris"], ''[[Index Magazine]]'', 2001.

== Career ==
While working odd jobs across [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], [[Chicago]], and [[New York City]], Sedaris was discovered in a Chicago club by radio host [[Ira Glass]]; Sedaris was reading a diary he had kept since 1977. Glass asked him to appear on his weekly local program, ''[[Ira Glass#Early career|The Wild Room]]''.<ref name="he does">Marchese, John. [https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/04/style/he-does-radio-and-windows.html "He Does Radio And Windows"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 4, 1993. Retrieved October 7, 2007.</ref> Sedaris said, "I owe everything to Ira&nbsp;... My life just changed completely, like someone waved a magic wand."<ref name="grapes">St. John, Warren.

Retrieved October 7, 2007.</ref> Sedaris's success on ''The Wild Room'' led to his [[National Public Radio]] debut on December 23, 1992, when he read a radio essay on ''[[Morning Edition]]'' titled "[[Santaland Diaries]]", which described his purported experiences as an elf at [[Macy's]] department store during Christmas in New York.

"Santaland Diaries" was a success with listeners,<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5066175 "Sedaris and Crumpet the Elf: A Holiday Tradition"], [[National Public Radio|NPR]].org. Retrieved October 8, 2007.</ref> and made Sedaris what ''[[The New York Times]]'' called "a minor phenomenon".<ref name="he does" /> He began recording a monthly segment for NPR based on his diary entries, edited and produced by Glass, and signed a two-book deal with [[Little, Brown and Company]].<ref name="he does" /> In 1993, Sedaris told ''The New York Times'' he was publishing his first book, a collection of stories and essays, and had 70 pages written of his second book, a novel "about a man who keeps a diary and whom Mr. Sedaris described as 'not me, but a lot like me'."<ref name="he does" />

=== Collections and mainstream success ===
In 1994, Sedaris published ''[[Barrel Fever]]'', a collection of stories and essays. He became a frequent contributor when Ira Glass began a weekly hour-long [[Public Radio International|PRI]]/[[Chicago Public Radio]] show, ''[[This American Life]]'', in 1995. Sedaris began writing essays for ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' and ''[[The New Yorker]]''. In 1997, he published another collection of essays, ''[[Naked (book)|Naked]]'', which won the [[Randy Shilts Award]] for Gay Non-Fiction from [[Publishing Triangle]] in 1998.<ref>{{cite web |website=The Publishing Triangle |title=Publishing Triangle Awards|url=http://www.publishingtriangle.org/awards.asp#Randy |access-date=May 15, 2014}}</ref>
