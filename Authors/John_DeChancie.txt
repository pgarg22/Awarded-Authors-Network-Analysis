'''John DeChancie''' (born August 3, 1946) is an American author.  A [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] native, he is most famous for his [[comic fantasy]] ''Castle'' series, and his [[science fiction]] ''Skyway'' series.  He is currently engaged in writing screenplays, teleplays, and prose fiction.

== The ''Castle Perilous'' Series ==
{{main|Castle Perilous (series)}}
The ''Castle Perilous'' series revolves around Castle Perilous (the name is drawn from the [[Siege Perilous]] of [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] fable), whose lord is Incarnadine, a [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcerer]]. 144,000 doors (or "aspects") of the Castle each lead to another [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]].  Some of these dimensions are magical, while others have little or no magic; one of the latter is [[Earth]].  Those who find themselves at the Castle often stay to become residents, and (to their surprise) develop a [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] power of their own.  This gift is apparently random, and can range from a minor [[telekinesis]] limited to lifting pencils to super-enhanced senses to [[teleportation]] to full conjuration of matter.  The main character, a [[philosophy]] major from Earth named Gene Ferraro, gains the power of superb swordplay.  His best friends include Snowclaw, a giant humanoid covered in white fur, who originally comes from a [[Geographical pole|polar]]-like clime, and Linda Barclay, a woman from Earth who becomes a powerful [[magician (fantasy)|sorceress]].

== The ''Skyway'' Series ==

The ''Skyway'' series differs from the ''Castle'' series significantly; where the ''Castle'' series is humorous fantasy, the ''Skyway'' series is action-adventure science fiction.  The ''Skyway'' series traces the adventures of Jake McGraw, who drives a futuristic cargo truck on the Skyway.  The Skyway itself is a mysterious road, built by an unknown race of aliens, which runs across various planets from one portal to another.  Driving through a portal (a "tollbooth") instantaneously transports you onto a different planet, many light years away.  Humans found the Skyway on Pluto and began expanding along it, encountering various alien races along the way.  However no one has a map, or knows where the Skyway begins or ends, and because each portal is one-way, only explored sections with a known return path (discovered by trial and error) are considered safe to travel.

At the beginning of the first book Jake finds himself in trouble because a number of parties, both human and alien, are convinced that he has found a map. Some are willing to kill to get it.  Jake knows that he does not have a map, but no one believes him.  At this point Jake is accompanied only by his father, Sam, who is actually dead but has been "[[Mind uploading|converted]]" into an [[artificial general intelligence|artificial intelligence]] unit that is built into the truck.  The truck itself is a large [[tractor trailer]] unit, powered by [[nuclear fusion]] and capable of operating in a vacuum.  The truck's cab can hold 8 or more people and has built-in bunks for sleeping.  At the beginning of the first book Jake stops to pick up a [[hitchhiker]] (the beautiful and mysterious Darla), which is the beginning of a trend: over the course of the trilogy more and more people are riding with Jake while more and more people are also pursuing him.  By the end of the trilogy Jake and his companions have reached the end of the Skyway, met with the beings that created it, and returned months earlier than when they left, bringing the trilogy to a conclusion.
