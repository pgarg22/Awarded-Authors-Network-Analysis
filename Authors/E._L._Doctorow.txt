'''Edgar Lawrence Doctorow''' (January 6, 1931 – July 21, 2015) was an American novelist, editor, and professor, best known internationally for his works of [[historical fiction]].

He wrote twelve novels, three volumes of short fiction and a stage drama. They included the award-winning novels ''[[Ragtime (novel)|Ragtime]]'' (1975), ''[[Billy Bathgate]]'' (1989), and ''[[The March (novel)|The March]]'' (2005). These, like many of his other works, placed fictional characters in recognizable historical contexts, with known historical figures, and often used different narrative styles. His stories were recognized for their originality and versatility, and Doctorow was praised for his audacity and imagination.<ref name=nyt>[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/22/books/el-doctorow-author-of-historical-fiction-dies-at-84.html "E. L. Doctorow Dies at 84; Literary Time Traveler Stirred Past Into Fiction"], ''The New York Times'', July 21, 2015</ref>

A number of Doctorow's novels and short stories were also adapted for the screen, including ''[[Welcome to Hard Times (film)|Welcome to Hard Times]]'' (1967) starring [[Henry Fonda]], ''[[Daniel (1983 film)|Daniel]]'' (1983) starring [[Timothy Hutton]], ''[[Billy Bathgate (film)|Billy Bathgate]]'' (1991) starring [[Dustin Hoffman]], and ''[[Wakefield (film)|Wakefield]]'' (2016) starring [[Bryan Cranston]]. His most notable adaptations were for the film ''[[Ragtime (film)|Ragtime]]'' (1981) and the Broadway [[Ragtime (musical)|musical of the same name]] (1998), which won four [[Tony Awards]].

Doctorow was the recipient of numerous writing awards, including the [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] for ''[[Ragtime (novel)|Ragtime]]'', [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] for ''[[Billy Bathgate]]'', [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] for ''[[The March (novel)|The March]],'' and the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] Gold Medal for Fiction. Former President [[Barack Obama]] called him "one of America's greatest novelists".<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-33618570 "US novelist EL Doctorow dies at 84"], BBC, July 22, 2015</ref>

Back in New York after military service, Doctorow worked as a reader for a motion picture company; reading so many [[Western (genre)|Westerns]] inspired his first novel, ''[[Welcome to Hard Times (novel)|Welcome to Hard Times]]''.

When asked how he decided to become a writer, he said, "I was a child who read everything I could get my hands on. Eventually, I asked of a story not only what was to happen next, but how is this done? How am I made to live from words on a page? And so I became a writer."<ref name=guardian2>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/22/author-el-doctorow-dies-in-new-york-aged-84 "EL Doctorow, author of Ragtime and Billy Bathgate, dies in New York aged 84"], ''The Guardian'', U.K., July 22, 2015</ref>

To support his family, Doctorow spent nine years as a book editor, first at [[New American Library]] working with [[Ian Fleming]] and [[Ayn Rand]] among others; and from 1964, as editor-in-chief at [[Dial Press]], publishing work by [[James Baldwin]], [[Norman Mailer]], [[Ernest J. Gaines]], and [[William Kennedy (author)|William Kennedy]], among others.<ref name="telegraph"/><ref name="guardian"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/21/e-l-doctorow-s-readers-were-guaranteed-a-good-time.html|title=E.L.

In 1969, Doctorow left publishing to pursue a writing career. He accepted a position as Visiting Writer at the [[University of California, Irvine]], where he completed ''[[The Book of Daniel (novel)|The Book of Daniel]]'' (1971),<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/07/21/el-doctorow-author-dies-84|title=E.L.

It was widely acclaimed, called a "masterpiece" by ''[[The Guardian]]'', and said by ''[[The New York Times]]'' to launch the author into "the first rank of American writers" according to [[Christopher Lehmann-Haupt]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1971/06/07/books/doctorow-daniel.html Review of 'The Book of Daniel'], ''The New York Times'', June 7, 1971.</ref>

Doctorow's next book, written in his home in [[New Rochelle, New York]], was ''[[Ragtime (novel)|Ragtime]]'' (1975), later named one of the [[Modern Library 100 Best Novels|100 best novels]] of the 20th century by the [[Modern Library]] editorial board.<ref>[http://www.randomhouse.com/modernlibrary/100bestnovels.html "Modern Library: 100 Best Novels"]. Random House. Retrieved September 5, 2008.</ref> His subsequent work includes the award-winning novels ''[[World's Fair (novel)|World's Fair]]'' (1985), ''[[Billy Bathgate]]'' (1989), and ''[[The March (novel)|The March]]'' (2005), as well as several volumes of essays and short fiction.

Novelist [[Jay Parini]] is impressed by Doctorow's skill at writing fictionalized history in a unique style, "a kind of detached but arresting presentation of history that mingled real characters with fictional ones in ways that became his signature manner".<ref name=cnn>[http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/22/opinions/parini-doctorow-appreciation/ "E.L. Doctorow's gift"], CNN, July 22, 2015</ref> In ''Ragtime'', for example, he arranges the story to include [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Carl Jung]] sharing a ride at Coney Island, or a setting with [[Henry Ford]] and [[J. P. Morgan]].<ref name=cnn/>

Despite the immense research Doctorow needed to create stories based on real events and real characters, reviewer John Brooks notes that they were nevertheless "alive enough never to smell the research in old newspaper files that they must have required".<ref name=nyt/> Doctorow demonstrated in most of his novels "that the past is very much alive, but that it's not easily accessed," writes Parini. "We tell and retell stories, and these stories illuminate our daily lives. He showed us again and again that our past is our present, and that those not willing to grapple with 'what happened' will be condemned to repeat its worst errors."<ref name=cnn/>

==Personal life and death==
In 1954, Doctorow married fellow Columbia University student Helen Esther Setzer while serving in the U.S. Army in West Germany.<ref>''Contemporary Jewish-American Novelists: A Bio-critical Sourcebook'' (1997) by Joel Shatzky and Michael Taub, pp. 54</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-0722-e-l-doctorow-20150722-story.html|title=E.L.

Doctorow also taught at [[Sarah Lawrence College]], the [[Yale School of Drama]], the [[University of Utah]], the [[University of California, Irvine]], and [[Princeton University]]. He was the Loretta and [[Lewis Glucksman]] Professor of English and American Letters at [[New York University]]. In 2001, he donated his papers to the [[Fales Library|Fales Library of New York University]]. In the opinion of the library's director, Marvin Taylor, Doctorow was "one of the most important American novelists of the 20th century".<ref>[http://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2001/04/19/from_ragtime_to_our.html "From ''Ragtime'' to Our Time E.L.
