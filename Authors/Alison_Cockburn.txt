'''Alison Cockburn''' also  '''Alison Rutherford''', or  '''Alicia Cockburn'''  (8 October 1712{{snd}}22 November 1794) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] poet, [[wit]] and [[socialite]] who collected a circle of eminent friends in 18th-century [[Scottish Enlightenment|enlightenment]] Edinburgh including [[Walter Scott]], [[Robert Burns]] and [[David Hume]].

==Life==
Born at Fairnilee House, in the [[Scottish Borders]], between [[Galashiels]] and [[Selkirk, Scottish Borders|Selkirk]], she was the daughter of Robert Rutherfurd of Fairnalee. She married an impoverished [[advocate]], Patrick Cockburn of [[Ormiston]] in 1731. Unable to afford a home of their own they lived for 4 years in the house of her elderly father-in-law, "an old Presbyterian of the deepest dye" who condemned as ungodly cards, plays, and dancing. On the death of the old man they moved to Edinburgh, and she began to mix in society where her liveliness and wit made her welcome in spite of her relatively lowly status.

In 1745 during the [[Jacobite rising of 1745|Jacobite rising]] she vented her [[Whiggism]] in a [[Squib (linguistics)|squib]] upon [[Charles Edward Stuart|Bonnie Prince Charlie]], and narrowly escaped being taken by the Highland guard as she was driving through Edinburgh in the family coach of the Keiths of Ravelston, with the parody in her pocket.<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Cockburn, Alicia|volume=6|page=624}} This cites her ''Letters and Memorials ... with notes by T. Craig Brown'' (1900).</ref>

Her husband died in 1753, and left her a small income.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Team|first=National Records of Scotland Web|date=2013-05-31|title=National Records of Scotland|url=https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/research/learning/hall-of-fame/hall-of-fame-a-z/cockburn-alison|access-date=2021-11-16|website=National Records of Scotland|language=English}}</ref> She continued to mix in artistic and intellectual circles from her home in Bristo Street, on Castle-hill, Edinburgh. Despite the added loss of her only son in infancy we are told of, "her insatiable love of mischief, mockery and match-making, everywhere welcome, both in town and country, a good companion, a wise friend, ready to jest over her own ailments."

In 1765 she published her lyrics to the traditional Border Ballad the ''[[Flowers of the Forest]]'' beginning "I've seen the smiling of Fortune beguiling".  It is said to have been written before her marriage in 1731<ref>{{Cite web|title=Flowers of the Forest {{!}} ballad by Cockburn {{!}} Britannica|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Flowers-of-the-Forest|access-date=2021-11-16|website=www.britannica.com|language=en}}</ref> and concerns a financial crisis that had ruined the fortunes of a number of the Selkirk [[Laird]]s. Later biographers, however, think it probable that it was written on the departure to London of a certain John Aikman, with whom Alison appears to have had an early attachment.<ref name="EB1911"/> Another later set of lyrics to the song by [[Jean Elliot]] of Minto written in 1756 is also in circulation and should not be confused with Rutherford's.

In 1773 she was living at St Andrews Square in a then new house in [[New Town, Edinburgh|Edinburgh's New town]].<ref>Edinburgh Post Office directory 1773</ref>

In 1777 she remarked of a young [[Walter Scott]] that he was "the most extraordinary genius of a boyo."  She befriended [[Robert Burns]] in 1786, whom she described as having "a most enthusiastic heart of love".  She was a great friend of the philosopher [[David Hume]].<ref name=Henderson>{{Cite DNB|wstitle=Cockburn, Alicia|first=Thomas Finlayson|last=Henderson|volume=11|pages=181-182}}</ref>

She was an indefatigable letter-writer and a composer of parodies, squibs, toasts and "character sketches", then a favourite form of composition.  The "Flowers of the Forest" however is considered the only thing she wrote that possesses lasting literary merit.<ref name="EB1911"/><ref name=Henderson />

At her house on Castlehill, and afterwards in Crichton Street, she received many illustrious friends, among whom were [[Henry Mackenzie]], [[William Robertson, Historian|William Robertson]], David Hume, [[John Home]], [[James Burnett, Lord Monboddo|Lord Monboddo]],<ref>Betteridge, R. & McLean, R. (2019), ''Northern Lights: The Scottish Enlightenment'', National Library of Scotland, p. 10</ref> the [[Clan Keith|Keiths of Ravelston]], the Balcarres family and [[Lady Anne Barnard]], the author of "Auld Robin Gray." As a Rutherfurd she had a connexion with Sir Walter Scott's mother, and was her intimate friend. Lockhart quotes a letter written by Mrs Cockburn in 1777, describing the conduct of little Walter Scott, then scarcely six years old, during a visit which she paid to his mother, when the child gave as a reason for his liking for Mrs Cockburn that she was a "virtuoso like himself."<ref name="EB1911"/><ref name=Henderson />

Cockburn died on 22 November 1794.<ref name=Henderson /> She is buried in the kirkyard of Buccleuch Parish Church (aka [[St. Cuthbert's Chapel of Ease]]) in south Edinburgh.
