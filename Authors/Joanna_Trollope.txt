==Biography==
===Early life===
Trollope was born on 9 December 1943 in her grandfather's rectory in [[Minchinhampton]], Gloucestershire, England, daughter of Rosemary Hodson and Arthur George Cecil Trollope.<ref name="BNS1960">{{Citation| title=British novelists since 1960 | publisher=Gale Group | year=1999 | pages=323}}</ref><ref name="IWiWA&W">{{Citation| title=International who's who of authors and writers, Volumen 23 | publisher=Europa Publications, Taylor & Francis Group Hyear=2008}}</ref> Her father was an [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] classics graduate who became head of a small building society and a painter. Her mother was an artist and writer.<ref name="Allardice">{{cite news|last=Allardice|first=Lisa|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/feb/11/featuresreviews.guardianreview10|title=Survival tactics|work=The Guardian|date=11 February 2006|access-date=24 March 2019}}</ref> Her father was away for war service in India when she was born; he returned when she was three. The family settled in [[Reigate]], Surrey, where she was eldest of three children; Trollope has a brother and sister. Trollope was educated at Reigate County School for Girls,<ref name="Bedell">{{cite news|last=Bedell|first=Geraldine|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/gloucestershire-chronicles-joanna-trollopes-domestic-rural-novels-with-their-big-kitchen-tables-1494251.html|title=Gloucestershire Chronicles|work=The Independent on Sunday|date=27 June 1993|access-date=24 March 2019}}</ref> followed by a 1961 scholarship to [[St Hugh's College, Oxford]] where she read English.<ref name="Taylor">{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Jeremy|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/me-and-mymotor-the-author-joanna-trollope-wh3x6qmg9|title=Me and My Motor: the author Joanna Trollope|work=The Sunday Times|date=7 October 2018|access-date=24 March 2019}} {{subscription required}}</ref>

Her father was of the same family as the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] novelist [[Anthony Trollope]]; she is his fifth-generation niece,<ref name="Quindy">{{Cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/joanna-trollope-you-ask-the-questions-484828.html |title=Joanna Trollope: You Ask the Questions | date=3 February 2005 |work=[[The Independent]] }}</ref> and is a cousin of the writer and broadcaster James Trollope. Of inheriting the name, she has said:

I admire him hugely, both for his benevolence and his enormous psychological perception".<ref>[http://www.bookreporter.com/authors/au-trollope-joanna.asp#view9904 Joanna Trollope] biography, Book Reporter.</ref>}}

===Career===
From 1965 to 1967, she worked at the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]]. While a civil servant, she researched Eastern Europe and the relations between China and the developing world.<ref name="Times2005">{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/before-she-was-famous-joanna-trollope-nn0gkjv8zdv|title=Before she was famous ... Joanna Trollope|work=The Times|date=21 July 2005|access-date=24 March 2019}} {{subscription required}}</ref> From 1967 to 1979, she was employed in a number of teaching posts before she became a writer full-time in 1980.

Trollope began writing historical romances under the pseudonym of Caroline Harvey, the first names of her father's parents. While these were her effective apprenticeship, she came to believe: "It was the wrong genre for the time."<ref name="Allardice" /> Encouraged by her second husband, [[Ian Curteis]], she was persuaded her to switch to contemporary fiction for which she has become known.<ref name="Das">{{cite news|last=Das|first=Lina|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/joanne-trollope-marriage-breakdown-relief-could-tell-people/|title=Joanna Trollope: My marriage breakdown was a relief – I could tell people I was in turmoil|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=13 May 2017|access-date=23 March 2019}}</ref> ''The Choir'', published in 1987, was her first contemporary novel.<ref name="Quindy" /> ''The Rector's Wife'', published in 1991, displaced [[Jeffrey Archer]] from the top of the hardback bestseller lists. As an explanation, she said in 2006: "except for thrillers there was nothing in the middle ground of the traditional novel, which is where I think I am."<ref name="Allardice" /> In 1992, only [[Jilly Cooper]]'s ''Polo'' and Archer's ''[[As the Crow Flies (novel)|As the Crow Flies]]'' were stronger paperback bestsellers. "I think my books are just the dear old traditional novel making a quiet comeback", she told [[Geraldine Bedell]] in a 1993 interview for ''The Independent on Sunday''.<ref name="Bedell" />

Often described as [[Aga saga]]s, for their rural themes, only two of Trollope's novels (by 2006) actually feature an [[AGA cooker|Aga]].<ref name="Allardice" /> The term's entry in ''[[The Oxford Companion to English Literature]]'' (2009) states that "by no means all her work fits the generally comforting implications of the label".<ref name="Birch" /> Rejecting the label as not being accurate, Trollope told Lisa Allardice, writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2006: "Actually, the novels are quite subversive, quite bleak. It's all rather patronising isn't it?"<ref name="Allardice" /> Allardice disputed the "cosy reputation" Trollope's books had acquired as her novels had "tackled increasingly thorny issues including lesbianism, broken families and adoption, the mood growing darker with each novel."<ref name="Allardice" /> [[Terence Blacker]], who coined the term for Trollope's fiction in ''Publishing News'' in 1992,<ref name="Birch">{{cite book|editor1-last=Birch|editor1-first=Dinah|editor2-last=Drabble|editor2-first=Margaret|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6jicAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA43|title=The Oxford Companion to English Literature|location=Oxford, Oxon & New York City|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|page=43|isbn=9780192806871}}</ref> admitted a decade later that he "felt terribly guilty" for lumbering Trollope with the phrase.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gibbons|first=Fiachra|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/may/30/books.guardianhayfestival2003|title=Queens of the bonkbuster and Aga saga defend the art - and heart - of their fiction|work=The Guardian|date=30 May 2003|access-date=24 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Blacker|first=Terence|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/terence-blacker/aga-saga-may-be-my-phrase-but-its-not-my-style-106885.html|title='Aga saga' may be my phrase, but it's not my style|work=The Independent|date=31 May 2003|access-date=24 March 2019}}</ref> Trollope told Bedell in 1993 that her fiction does "the things the traditional novel has always done" by mirroring reality and exploring "people's emotional lives". Bedell observed that her novels until then were:<blockquote> "never suburban, which is the real condition of most of England. Trollopian action takes place in large village houses, at vast kitchen tables; her doctors, vicars, solicitors and craft-gallery owners may worry about money, as her own parents did, but they don't have any social anxieties: they are invited for drinks at the big house as a matter of course. The books are as economically prestigious, and quite as aspirational in their own way, as the glitter blockbusters of the Eighties."<ref name="Bedell" /></blockquote>

In 2009, she donated the short story ''The Piano Man'' to Oxfam's '[[Ox-Tales]]' project, four collections of UK stories written by 38 authors. Trollope's story was published in the 'Water' collection.<ref>[http://www.oxfam.org.uk/shop/content/books/books_oxtales.html Ox-Tales] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718005818/http://www.oxfam.org.uk/shop/content/books/books_oxtales.html |date=18 July 2011 }}, [[Oxfam]], UK.</ref>
She has written the first novel in Harper Collins updating of the [[Jane Austen]] canon, ''The Austen Project''. Her version of "Sense and Sensibility" was published in October 2013 with limited success.

An adaptation of ''The Rector's Wife'' (<!-- The year of first screening in the UK as well. -->1994), produced for [[Channel 4]], starred [[Lindsay Duncan]] and [[Ronald Pickup]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Scott|first=Tony|url=https://variety.com/1994/tv/reviews/masterpiece-theatre-the-rector-s-wife-1200439016/|title=Masterpiece Theatre: The Rector's Wife|work=Variety|date=12 October 1994|access-date=24 March 2019}}</ref> ''The Choir'', adapted by Ian Curteis, was a five-episode [[BBC]]  television [[miniseries]] in 1995. It starred [[Jane Asher]] and [[James Fox (actor)|James Fox]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/459911/Choir-The/|title=Choir, The(1995)|work=TCM|date=29 October 1995|access-date=24 March 2019}}</ref> Of her other novels, ''A Village Affair'' and ''Other People's Children'' have also been adapted for television.<ref name="Quindy" />

==Reviews==
''A Spanish Lover'': In ''[[The New York Times]]'' Betsy Groban wrote, ″Her story is filled with lively, astute and always affectionate insights into the abiding issues of marriage, motherhood and materialism, not to mention the destructive power of envy and the importance of living one's own life. ″<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Groban|first1=Betsy|title=A Spanish Lover|journal=The New York Times|date=6 April 1997}}</ref>

''Marrying the Mistress'':  ″With its sharp eye, light tone and sly, witty pace, Joanna Trollope's ninth novel delivers all the ingredients of romantic comedy, yet ends with a subtle, dark twist.″<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Frucht|first1=Abby|title=Marrying the Mistress|journal=The New York Times|date=9 July 2000}}</ref>

''Friday Nights'': Heather Thompson of ''[[The Guardian]]'' called ''Friday Nights'' "a light but insightful look at a rather conventional cast of characters."<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jan/11/friday-nights-trollope-review| title=Review: Friday Nights| author=Heather Thompson | work=[[The Observer]] | date=11 January 2009 }}</ref>

Charlie Lee-Potter, in an article for ''[[The Independent]]'', wrote that ''Brother & Sister'':
{{quote|[Brother & Sister] wades through the anguish of adoption, scooping up the pain of the adopted child, the agony of the birth mother and the insecurity of the adoptive parent along the way. If I was any one of the characters imprisoned in the murky jelly of this novel, I'd be straight on to the Adoption Agency, demanding to be re-settled with another creator. Joanna Trollope has a subject capable of making us weep at the tragedy and the loss, and yet what does she achieve? She so resolutely makes her characters emote to each other in a ghastly brand of unisex mush that I actually found myself blushing.<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/brother-amp-sister-by-joanna-trollope-568485.html| title=Brother & Sister by Joanna Trollope | first=Charlie | last=Lee-Potter| date=1 February 2004 | work=The Independent}}{{dead link|date=August 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>}}

==Personal life==
On 14 May 1966,<ref name="IWiWA&W" /> Trollope married city banker David Roger William Potter; the couple had two daughters, Antonia and Louise, before their divorce in 1983.<ref name="BNS1960" /><ref name="Das" /> In 1985, she married the television dramatist [[Ian Curteis]] and became a stepmother of his two sons; she and Curteis divorced in 2001. After her second divorce, Trollope moved to West London.<ref name="Taylor" /> She is a grandmother.<ref name="Allardice" /><ref>[http://www.readersread.com/features/joannatrollope.htm ''Interview With Joanna Trollope'', Readers Read]</ref>

Trollope appeared on a 1994 edition of ''[[Desert Island Discs]]''. The show's format asks guests to choose a book and a luxury item to take with them on an imaginary castaway island; Trollope chose ''[[The Oxford Book of English Verse]]'' and a bed with white [[Egyptian cotton|Egyptian sheets]]. In the episode Trollope remarked that men often suggested her books were trivial, to which she liked to respond: "It is a grave mistake to think there is more significance in great things than in little things", paraphrasing [[Virginia Woolf]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0093qc8|title=BBC Radio 4 - Desert Island Discs, Joanna Trollope|website=BBC|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last1=Woolf|first1=Virginia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3sCJDwAAQBAJ&q=virginai+woolf+let+us+not+take+i+for+granted&pg=PR235|title=Virginia Woolf: The Complete Collection|last2=Book|first2=Century|date=2017-03-19|publisher=Oregan Publishing|isbn=979-10-97338-69-5|language=en}}</ref>
