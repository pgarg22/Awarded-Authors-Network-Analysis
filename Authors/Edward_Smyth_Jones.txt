== Life ==
Edward Smyth (sometimes spelled Smythe) Jones was born to former enslaved parents Hawk and Rebecca in Natchez, Mississippi in 1881. He attended Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College (now [[Alcorn State University]]) for 14 months in 1902–1903, and then later moved to Louisville, Kentucky, where he published his first book of thirty poems, ''The Rose that Bloometh in My Heart'' in 1908. Jones had a lifelong desire for education, and particularly wanted to study at [[Harvard University]].<ref name=":1" /> Having left Louisville for Indianapolis, Jones set out on foot (and occasionally hopping freight trains) in the summer of 1910 for Cambridge, Massachusetts.<ref name=":0" /> "Arriving travel-worn, friendless, moneyless, hungry, he was preparing to bivouac on the Harvard campus his first night in the University city, when, being misunderstood, and not believed, he was apprehended as a vagabond and thrown into jail."<ref name=":1" />

While sitting in "Cell No. 40, East Cambridge Jail, Cambridge, Mass., July 26, 1910"<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|last=Jones|first=Edward Smyth|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/26036/26036-h/26036-h.htm#Page_p-084|title=The Sylvan Cabin. A Centenary Ode on the Birth of Lincoln and Other Verse|publisher=Sherman, French & Company|year=1911|location=Boston}}</ref> Jones described his journey to Harvard and subsequent arrest in the poem "Harvard Square":

<blockquote>"As soon as locked within the jail,

Deep in a ghastly cell,

Methought I heard the bitter wail

Of all the fiends of hell!"

O God, to Thee I humbly pray

No treacherous prison snare

Shall close my soul within for aye

From dear old Harvard Square.

Just then I saw an holy Sprite

Shed all her radiant beams,

And round her shone the source of light

Of all the poets' dreams!

I plied my pen in sober use,

And spent each moment spare

In sweet communion with the Muse

I met in Harvard Square!"<ref name=":3" />
</blockquote>

Jones presented documentation attesting to his character, as well as his poem "Ode to Ethiopia" to arraigning judge Arthur P. Stone, and this, combined with help from the Black lawyer [[Clement G. Morgan]] and educator [[William Henry Holtzclaw|William H. Holtzclaw]], was enough to eventually secure his release from jail.<ref name=":0" /> Jones went on to secure janitorial work at Harvard, and began attending [[Boston Latin School]], but was unable to finish and enroll in [[Harvard College]] due to lack of funds.<ref name=":0" /> By 1913 Jones was in New York working as a waiter at the Columbia University Faculty Club, where he was profiled by the ''New York Times''.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1913/02/16/archives/columbia-faculty-club-served-by-colored-votary-of-the-muse-edward.html Columbia Faculty Club Served by Colored Votary of the Muse].

Contemporary views of Jones' poetry praised his eloquence and imagery<ref name=":2">United States. Work Projects Administration. New Jersey., Carter, C. W., Wormley, B. F. (1937). [https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001372251/Home An anthology of Negro poetry by Negroes and others]. [Trenton?.</ref> and his luxurious use of language.<ref name=":1" /> His poem "A Song of Thanks" was included in the landmark 1922 compilation ''[[The Book of American Negro Poetry]]'',<ref>Johnson, J.W. (1922) (ed.). The book of American Negro poetry. New York: Harcourt, Brace and Company. http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11986/pg11986-images.html</ref> edited by [[James Weldon Johnson]].

[[iarchive:negropoetstheirp00kerl/page/162/mode/2up|Negro poets and their poems]]. Washington, D.C.: Associated.
