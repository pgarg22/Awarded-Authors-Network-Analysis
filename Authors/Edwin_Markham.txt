'''Edwin Markham''' (born '''Charles Edward<!-- not Edwin --> Anson Markham'''; April 23, 1852 – March 7, 1940) was an American poet.

==Life==
Edwin Markham was born in [[Oregon City, Oregon]], and was the youngest of 10 children; his parents divorced shortly after his birth. At the age of four, he moved to Lagoon Valley, a Christian College in [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa]], California. In 1869, Markham moved again further south to [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], where he lived for the next 20 years. During this time, he attended San Jose Normal School (now [[San Jose State University]]) as a member of the first graduating class (1872), and wrote the poem [[The Man with the Hoe]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Edwin Markham Information|url=https://www.sjsu.edu/people/annette.nellen/website/markham.htm|access-date=2021-11-09|website=www.sjsu.edu}}</ref> The house in which he wrote the poem was preserved and moved to the city's [[History Park]], and now serves as a poetry center. He went by "Charles" until about 1895, when he was about 43, when he started using "Edwin."<ref>[http://www.oac.cdlib.org/view?docId=kt467nc7c6;developer=local;query=;style=oac4;view=admin#bioghist-1.3.6 Biographical History from the Edwin Markham Collection Finding Aid at San Jose State University]

In 1898, Markham married his third wife, Anna Catherine Murphy (1859–1938), and in 1899 their son [[Virgil Markham]] was born. They moved to [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1900 to study natives and their appeasement, then to New York City, where they lived in [[Brooklyn]] and then [[Staten Island]]. Edwin Markham had, by the time of his death, amassed a huge library of 15000+ books.  This collection was bequeathed to [[Wagner College]]'s Horrmann Library, located on Staten Island. Markham also [[will (law)|willed]] his personal papers to the library. Edwin's correspondents included [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[Ambrose Bierce]], [[Aleister Crowley]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://dcmnystage.metro.dgicloud.com/islandora/object/edwinmarkham%3A951 |title=Archived copy |access-date=February 7, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207151848/http://dcmnystage.metro.dgicloud.com/islandora/object/edwinmarkham%3A951 |archive-date=February 7, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Jack London|Jack]] and [[Charmian London|Charmian]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=%22edwin+markham%22+%22charmian+london%22+%22staten+island%22&qt=results_page|title=Results for '"edwin markham" "charmian london" "staten island"' [WorldCat.org]|website=www.worldcat.org}}</ref> London, [[Carl Sandburg]], [[Florence Earle Coates]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=%22florence+earle+coates%22+%22edwin+markham%22+%22staten+island%22&qt=results_page|title=Results for '"florence earle coates" "edwin markham" "staten island"' [WorldCat.org]|website=www.worldcat.org}}</ref> and [[Amy Lowell]].

==Career==
[[File:Millet, Jean-François - Man with a Hoe - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|''L'homme à la houe'' by [[Jean-François Millet]] ]]

Markham taught literature in [[El Dorado County, California|El Dorado County]] until 1879, when he became education [[Superintendent (education)|superintendent]] of the [[County (United States)|county]]. While residing in El Dorado County, Markham became a member of [[Placerville, California|Placerville]] [[Masonic Lodge]]. He also accepted a job as principal of Tompkins Observation School in [[Oakland, California]], in 1890. While in Oakland, he became well acquainted with many other famous contemporary writers and poets, such as [[Joaquin Miller]], [[Ina Coolbrith]], [[Charles Warren Stoddard]], and [[Edmund Clarence Stedman]].

Edwin Markham's most famous poem, "The Man with the Hoe," which accented laborers' hardships, was first presented at a public poetry reading in 1898. His main inspiration was a French painting of the same name (in French, ''L'homme à la houe'') by [[Jean-François Millet]]. Markham's poem was published, and it became quite popular very soon. In New York, he gave many lectures to labor groups. These happened as often as his poetry readings.

[[File:Edwin Markham cph.3a02003.jpg|thumb|left|A photograph of Markham in his later years]]

His 1904 edition of the works of Edgar Allan Poe was followed by multiple volumes of The Real America in Romance, issued from 1909 through 1927 by New York publisher W. H. Wise. His edited works included several collections of British and American poetry. An accomplished and popular lecturer, Markham also wrote essays, popular articles that discussed his own compositional approaches, and introductions to the works of others. Among the latter, his subjects included John Keats, John Greenleaf Whittier, and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. His efforts to raise public awareness of social ills were capped by contributions to a major volume examining child labor, Children in Bondage, in 1914.

In 1922, Markham's poem "Lincoln, the Man of the People" was selected from 250 entries to be presented at the dedication of the [[Lincoln Memorial]]. The author himself read the poem. Dr. [[Henry van Dyke Jr.|Henry Van Dyke]] of Princeton said of the poem, "Edwin Markham's Lincoln is the greatest poem ever written on the immortal martyr, and the greatest that ever will be written." Later that year, Markham was filmed reciting the poem by [[Lee De Forest]] in his [[Phonofilm]] sound-on-film process.

As recounted by [[biography in literature|literary biographer]] William R. Nash,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/poets/m_r/markham/life.htm|title=Edwin Markham's Life and Career – A Concise Overview|website=www.english.uiuc.edu}}</ref> "'['b]etween publications, Markham lectured and wrote in other genres, including essays and nonfiction prose. He also gave much of his time to organizations such as the Poetry Society of America, which he established in 1910. In 1922, at the conclusion to the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial, Markham read a revised version of his poem, "Lincoln the Man of the People."<ref>''The New York Times'', May 30, 1922</ref> Markham also wrote a number of [[epigrams]], of which the best known is ''Outwitted''.

Throughout Markham's later life, many readers viewed him as an important voice in American poetry, a position signified by honors such as his election in 1908 to the National Institute of Arts and Letters. Despite his numerous accolades, however, none of his later books achieved the success of the first two.

His single verse poem, 'Circles of Love,' [Markham, ''The Shoes of Happiness, and Other Poems'', 1913] is personally said by the authority on American etiquette [[Amy Vanderbilt]] [Amy Osborne Vanderbilt (July 22, 1908 – December 27, 1974)] to have been written while Markham was a guest at her family home on Staten Island, occasioned by his contemplations of the prevailing, early 19th industrialization and its implied schism from Christian principle.

==Legacy==
Six schools in California were named in honor of Markham. Three schools, all named Edwin Markham Elementary School, are in Oakland, Vacaville and Hayward, and three more are [[Markham Middle School]] in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Watts, Edwin Markham Middle School in Placerville, and Edwin Markham Junior High School in San Jose, the last since renamed Willow Glen Middle School.

Schools in other states named in his honor include Edwin Markham Intermediate School 51 in Staten Island, Edwin Markham Elementary north of Pasco, Washington, Edwin Markham Elementary School in Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania, and Markham Elementary in Portland, Oregon.

The Liberty Ship ''Edwin Markham'' was launched on May 5, 1942.

A street in the Palomares Hills neighborhood of Castro Valley, CA bears his name (Edwin Markham Drive).

The Markham Houses is a complex on Staten Island, as is a street there.

[[Markham House (Staten Island)|Markham House]], his residence until 1889, is now in San Jose's [[History Park]] and houses the [[Poetry Center San José]].
