He served as [[Poet Laureate of the United States]] from 1995 to 1997.<ref name="poets.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/194 |title=Robert Hass- Poets.org – Poetry, Poems, Bios & More |publisher=Poets.org |access-date=2014-01-21}}</ref> He won the 2007 [[National Book Award]]<ref name=nba2007/> and shared the 2008 [[Pulitzer Prize]]<ref name=pulitzer/> for the collection ''Time and Materials: Poems 1997–2005.''<ref name="Poetic Justice - Robert Hass">Goldman, Justin.

==Life==
Hass's works are well known for their [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] subjects and attitudes. He was born in San Francisco and grew up in [[San Rafael, California|San Rafael]].<ref name="Poetic Justice - Robert Hass"/> He grew up with an [[alcoholic]] mother, a major topic in the 1996 poem collection ''Sun Under Wood''. His older brother encouraged him to dedicate himself to his writing. Awestruck by [[Gary Snyder]] and [[Allen Ginsberg]], among others in the 1950s [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] poetry scene, Hass entertained the idea of becoming a [[beatnik]]. He graduated from [[Marin Catholic High School]] in 1958. When the area became influenced by East Asian literary techniques, such as [[haiku]], Hass took many of these influences up in his poetry. He has been hailed as "a lyrical virtuoso who is able to turn even cooking recipes into poetry".<ref>Andreas Dorschel, 'Zwischen Wein und Wüste', in: ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' Nr. 260 (11. November 2005), p. 16.</ref>

Hass is married to the poet and antiwar activist [[Brenda Hillman]], who is a professor at [[Saint Mary's College of California]].<ref name="Poetic Justice - Robert Hass"/>

==Career==
Hass graduated from [[Saint Mary's College of California|Saint Mary's College]] in [[Moraga, California]] in 1963, and received his [[Master's degree|MA]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in English from [[Stanford University]] in 1965 and 1971 respectively.<ref name="poets.org"/> At Stanford he studied with the poet and critic [[Yvor Winters]], whose ideas influenced his later writing and thinking. His Stanford classmates included the poets [[Robert Pinsky]], [[John Matthias (poet)|John Matthias]], and [[James L. McMichael|James McMichael]]. Hass taught literature and writing at the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|University at Buffalo]] in 1967. From 1971 to 1989, he taught at his alma mater St. Mary's, at which time he transferred to the faculty of [[University of California, Berkeley]]. He has been a visiting faculty member in the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]] at the [[University of Iowa]] on several occasions, and was a panelist at the Workshop's 75th anniversary celebration in June 2011.

From 1995 to 1997, during Hass's two terms as the US Poet Laureate ([[Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress]]), he became a champion of literacy, poetry, and [[ecology|ecological]] awareness. He criss-crossed the country lecturing in places as diverse as corporate boardrooms and for civic groups, or as he has said, "places where poets don't go." After his self-described "act of citizenship," he wrote a weekly column on poetry in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' until 2000. He serves as a Chancellor of the [[Academy of American Poets]], was a trustee of the [[Griffin Poetry Prize]] (now trustee emeritus), and works actively for literacy and the environment.

As major influences on his poetry, Hass cites [[Beat Generation|Beat]] poet [[Lew Welch]], and has praised the slogan "Raid Kills Bugs Dead," which Welch crafted while working for an advertising firm.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/poetryeverywhere/hass.html |title=Robert Hass &#124; Poetry Everywhere |publisher=PBS |date=2011-03-03 |access-date=2014-01-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/g_l/haas/onlineinterviews.htm |title=Robert Hass: Online Interviews |publisher=English.illinois.edu |access-date=2014-01-21}}</ref> Additionally, he has named Chilean [[Pablo Neruda]], Peruvian [[César Vallejo]], and Polish poets [[Zbigniew Herbert]], [[Wisława Szymborska]], and [[Czesław Miłosz]], whom he regards as the five most important poets of the last 50 years. While at Berkeley, Hass spent 15 to 20 years translating the poetry of Miłosz, his fellow Berkeley professor and neighbor,<ref name="Poetic Justice - Robert Hass"/> as part of a team with [[Robert Pinsky]] and Miłosz.

In 1999 Hass appeared in ''[[Wildflowers (film)|Wildflowers]]'', the debut film by director [[Melissa Painter]]. In the film Hass plays The Poet, a writer who is dying of an unnamed chronic illness. Excerpts from his poetry are included in the script, primarily read by Hass and actress [[Daryl Hannah]].

==Poetry==
Hass's poems tend to vary in structure as he alternates between prose-like blocks and free verse. His poems have been said to have a stylistic clarity, seen in his simple, clear language and precise imagery. His collection "Praise" features themes of seasons, nature, location, and transformation, with a running motif of blackberries. Poet Stanley Kunitz said of Hass's work, "Reading a poem by Robert Hass is like stepping into the ocean when the temperature of the water is not much different from that of the air. You scarcely know, until you feel the undertow tug at you, that you have entered into another element."<ref>{{cite web|title=Robert Hass|url=http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/robert-hass}}</ref>

The January 2017 "Gift Horse" episode<ref>{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.foreverdreaming.org/viewtopic.php?f=456&t=30477|title=03x11 – Gift Horse – Madam Secretary Transcripts – Forever Dreaming}}</ref> of the TV series "Madam Secretary" alludes to Hass. At a presidential inauguration, the poet laureate character ("Roland Hobbs") recites a poem that describes "the privilege of being", an allusion to Hass's 1999 poem of that title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/feb/14/books/bk-7893|title=Privilege of Being, By Robert Hass|date=14 February 1999|via=LA Times}}</ref>

==Activism==

Hass has been actively engaged in promoting [[Ecological literacy|ecoliteracy]]. In 1995 he began working with writer and environmentalist Pamela Michael on a program that encourages "children to make art and poetry about their watersheds" and fosters interdisciplinary environmental education.<ref>{{cite news|title=Robert Hass: Eight years of activism, writing, and reflection|url=http://berkeley.edu/news/berkeleyan/2007/11/08_hass.shtml|access-date=November 27, 2011|newspaper=The Berkeleyan|date=November 8, 2007}}</ref> In April 1996, when he was poet laureate, he organized a 6-day conference at the Library of Congress that brought together American nature writers to celebrate writing, the natural world and community.<ref>{{cite web|title=River of Words: History|url=http://www.riverofwords.org/history.html}}</ref> His watershed program expanded into the non-profit organization River of Words.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riverofwords.org|title=River Of Words|website=www.riverofwords.org}}</ref>  River of Words provides tools for teaching ecoliteracy and holds an annual poetry and art contest for children and teens.

On November 9, 2011, while participating in an [[Occupy movement]] demonstration at [[UC Berkeley]] called [[Occupy Cal]], a police officer hit Hass in the ribs with a baton. Another officer shoved his wife to the ground.<ref name=hassnyt>{{cite news|last=Hass|first=Robert|title=Poet-Bashing Police|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/20/opinion/sunday/at-occupy-berkeley-beat-poets-has-new-meaning.html|access-date=November 27, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 19, 2011}}</ref> Hass wrote about their experience in a November 19, 2011, ''[[New York Times]]'' opinion piece, "Poet-Bashing Police."
