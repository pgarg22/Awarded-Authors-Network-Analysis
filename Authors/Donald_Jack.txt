==Life==
Jack was born in [[Radcliffe, Greater Manchester|Radcliffe]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Bury|Bury]], England and grew up in Britain, attending the well regarded [[Bury Grammar School]] and [[Marr College]] and later serving in the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in [[World War II]] (1943–47).

After the war he emigrated to Canada in 1951, and became a Canadian citizen in 1964. From 1955 to 1957 he was a scriptwriter for [[F. R. Crawley|Crawley Films]]. After 1957 he became a full-time freelance writer.

He wrote for the stage, radio, and for television programs such as ''[[General Motors Theatre]]'', ''[[The Unforeseen]]'', ''Playdate'', ''[[Hatch's Mill]]'', ''[[The Forest Rangers]]'', and ''[[On Camera (Canadian TV series)|On Camera]]'', but he is most famous for his novels, the ''Bandy Papers'', which recount the humorous adventures of [[Bartholomew Bandy]], a [[World War I]] fighter pilot. His play ''[[The Canvas Barricade]]'' was the first Canadian play produced at the [[Stratford Festival of Canada]]. Other stage plays included ''Exit Muttering'', ''Crash'', and ''Minuet for Brass Band''. He had 39 TV plays produced, 22 radio plays, and numerous documentaries. Most of Jack's book-length works are being re-published, or published for the first time, by [[Sybertooth]].
