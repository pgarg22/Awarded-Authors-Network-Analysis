'''Eduardo De Filippo''' ({{IPA-it|eduˈardo de fiˈlippo|lang}}; 24 May 1900 – 31 October 1984), also known simply as '''Eduardo''',<ref>Name used only as actor; as actor and director he signed himself with both name and surname.</ref> was an Italian actor, [[playwright]], and [[screenwriter]], best known for his [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]] works ''[[Filumena Marturano]]'' and ''[[Side Street Story|Napoli Milionaria]]''. Considered one of the most important Italian artists of the 20th century, De Filippo was the author of many theatrical dramas staged and directed by himself first and later awarded and played outside Italy. For his artistic merits and contributions to Italian culture, he was named ''[[senatore a vita]]'' by the Italian [[President of Italy|Presidente della Repubblica]] [[Sandro Pertini]].

==Biography==
{{expand section|date=July 2018}}
De Filippo was born in [[Naples]] from the affair between playwright and actor [[Eduardo Scarpetta]] and theatre [[seamstress]] and [[costumier]] Luisa De Filippo. He was the second of three children born from the couple, the other two being [[Titina De Filippo|Annunziata "Titina"]] and [[Peppino De Filippo|Giuseppe "Peppino"]]. His father was actually married since 1876 to Rosa De Filippo, Luisa's paternal aunt. His father Eduardo had several other illegitimate children from various affairs (including actors Ernesto Murolo, [[Eduardo Passarelli]] and Pasquale De Filippo). He began acting at the age of five and in 1932 formed a theater company  with his brother [[Peppino De Filippo|Peppino]] and sister [[Titina De Filippo|Titina]], called ''compagnia del Teatro Umoristico I De Filippo''. Peppino left the troupe in 1944 and Titina departed by the early 1950s. After the war, in 1948 he bought the S. Ferdinando theatre in Naples, inaugurated in 1954.
De Filippo starred in [[Vittorio De Sica|De Sica]]'s ''[[L'oro di Napoli]]'' with [[Totò]] and [[Sophia Loren]] in 1954. In 1973, [[Franco Zeffirelli]]'s  production of De Filippo's 1959 play ''Sabato, domenica e lunedi'' (translated as ''Saturday, Sunday, Monday''), starring [[Joan Plowright]], [[Frank Finlay]] and [[Laurence Olivier]], was presented at London's [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] and won the London drama critics' award.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=TXBFC7Q41eUC&pg=PA164 Cassell Dictionary of Italian Literature - Page 164]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=WOAHl9i-n0EC&pg=PA19 McGraw-Hill encyclopedia of world drama: an international ...: Volume 1 - Page 19]</ref>

He was married three times. His first wife was Dorothy Pennington. From his second wife, the actress [[Thea Prandi]], he had two children: Luisa "Luisella" and [[Luca De Filippo|Luca]]. The couple divorced in 1959. His daughter Luisella died aged 10 in 1960, shortly before her mother's death in 1961. His third wife was writer and playwright Isabella Quarantotti. The actress [[Angelica Ippolito]] is his step-daughter, born to Isabella Quarantotti and her first husband, the scientist [[Felice Ippolito]].

De Filippo died of kidney failure on October 31, 1984, in Rome, at the age of 84. His artistic legacy was inherited by his son [[Luca De Filippo|Luca]].
