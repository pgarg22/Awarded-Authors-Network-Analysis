==Life==
Staff was born in [[Lwów]] (then  in the [[Austrian partition]]; now [[Lviv]], Ukraine) during the military [[partitions of Poland]]. He was one of three children of the local [[confectioner]] of Czech & German origin. He studied law and philosophy at the [[Lwów University]], and in 1918 settled in [[Warsaw]] at the cusp of Poland's [[Second Polish Republic|return to independence]]. He died at the age of 78 in [[Skarżysko-Kamienna]] soon after the [[Stalinist Poland|end of Stalinism]] in [[People's Republic of Poland|postwar Poland]], and was buried in [[Warsaw]] at the renowned [[Powązki Cemetery]].<ref name="staff.klp">{{cite web|title=Leopold Staff – biografia|url=http://staff.klp.pl/a-6256.html|publisher=Kulturalna Polska Klp.pl|accessdate=November 5, 2012}}</ref>

Staff was highly influential in the interwar period, including in the literary life of [[Julian Tuwim]], one of Poland's best-known poets. He served as vice-president of the [[Polish Academy of Literature]] since 1933, and since 1949 resided in Warsaw.<ref name="staff.klp" />

==Literary career==
Staff's writing can be divided into three periods: [[Young Poland]] until 1918, [[Interwar period]] (1918–39), and postwar Poland (following the end of World War II).

In the early 20th century, Staff became probably the most famous and influential Polish poet. He called his popularity a ''retiring, soft glory''. He was also the main role-model for Polish group of experimental poets named ''[[Skamander]]'' (founded in 1918). In the 1950s, he moved to [[blank verse]] in line with the ideals of Polish [[avant-garde]].

Some of his best-known short poems include ''The Bridge'' ("Most"), ''Foundations'' ("Podwaliny", transl. by Czesław Miłosz), and ''Three Towns'' ("Trzy miasta", 1954).
