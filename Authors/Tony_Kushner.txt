== Career ==
Kushner's best known work is ''[[Angels in America]]'' (a play in two parts: ''Millennium Approaches'' and ''Perestroika''), a seven-hour epic about the AIDS epidemic in [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan-era]] New York, which was later adapted into an [[HBO]] [[Angels in America (TV miniseries)|miniseries]] for which Kushner wrote the screenplay. His other plays include ''Hydriotaphia'', ''[[Slavs!: Thinking About the Longstanding Problems of Virtue and Happiness]]'', ''[[A Bright Room Called Day]]'', ''Homebody/Kabul'', and the book for the musical ''[[Caroline, or Change]]''. His new translation of [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s ''[[Mother Courage and Her Children]]'' was performed at the Delacorte Theater in the summer of 2006, starring [[Meryl Streep]] and directed by [[George C. Wolfe]]. Kushner has also adapted Brecht's ''[[The Good Person of Szechwan]]'', Corneille's ''[[The Illusion (play)|The Illusion]]'', and [[S. Ansky]]'s play ''[[The Dybbuk]]''.

In the early 2000s, Kushner began writing for film. His co-written screenplay ''[[Munich (2005 film)|Munich]]'' was produced and directed by [[Steven Spielberg]] in 2005. In January 2006, a documentary feature about Kushner entitled ''[[Wrestling with Angels: Playwright Tony Kushner|Wrestling with Angels]]'' debuted at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film was directed by [[Freida Lee Mock]]. In April 2011 it was announced that he was working with Spielberg again, writing the screenplay for an adaptation of historian [[Doris Kearns Goodwin]]'s book ''[[Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Yin|first=Maryann|title=Steven Spielberg & Tony Kushner To Adapt Team of Rivals|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/steven-spielberg-tony-kushner-to-adapt-team-of-rivals_b27796|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110417090339/http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/steven-spielberg-tony-kushner-to-adapt-team-of-rivals_b27796|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 17, 2011|access-date=May 5, 2011|newspaper=Mediabistro|date=May 14, 2011}}</ref> The screenplay for [[Lincoln (film)|''Lincoln'']] would go on to receive multiple awards, in addition to nominations for Best Adapted Screenplay at the [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globes]] and [[Academy Awards|The Oscars]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Lincoln|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443272/awards|access-date=January 19, 2018}}</ref>

In a 2015 interview actress/producer [[Viola Davis]] revealed she had hired Kushner to write an as yet untitled biopic about the life of [[Barbara Jordan]] that she planned to star in.<ref>{{cite news|last1=SYME|first1=RACHEL|title=Viola Davis, on Finding Creative Space in TV With No Limitations|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 25, 2015|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/26/arts/television/viola-davis-on-finding-creative-space-in-tv-with-no-limitations.html|access-date=August 27, 2015}}</ref>

In 2016, Kushner worked on a screenplay version of [[August Wilson]]'s play ''[[Fences (play)|Fences]]''; the resulting film ''[[Fences (film)|Fences]]'', directed by [[Denzel Washington]], was released in December 2016.

Kushner is famous for frequent revisions and years-long gestations of his plays. Both ''Angels in America: Perestroika'' and ''Homebody/Kabul'' were significantly revised even after they were first published. Kushner has admitted that the original script version of ''Angels in America: Perestroika'' is nearly double the length of the theatrical version.<ref>Lucas, Craig. [http://bombsite.com/issues/43/articles/1656 "Tony Kushner"], "[[BOMB Magazine]]", Spring, 1993. Retrieved July 25, 2011.</ref> His newest completed work, the play ''[[The Intelligent Homosexual's Guide to Capitalism and Socialism with a Key to the Scriptures]]'', began as a novel more than a decade before it finally opened on May 15, 2009.

In 2018, it was announced that Kushner was working on a script of a remake of ''[[West Side Story (2021 film)|West Side Story]]'' for Spielberg to direct.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2018/01/steven-spielberg-indiana-jones-west-side-story-directing-vehicles-1202262857/|title=Steven Spielberg Eyes Indiana Jones & 'West Side Story' Atop Next Directing Vehicles|last=Fleming|first=Mike Jr.|date=January 19, 2018|work=Deadline|access-date=January 19, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>

== Political views ==
[[File:Tony Kushner..jpg|thumb|Kushner speaking at the [[University of Maryland]] in 2011.]]
Kushner's criticism of [[Israel]]'s treatment of the [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]] and of the increased religious extremism in Israeli politics and culture has created some controversy with U.S. Jews,<ref>David Zax and Ted Merwin, (2007), [http://www.momentmag.com/the-playwrights-politics/ The Playwright's Politics] Moment Magazine</ref> including some opposition to his receiving an honorary doctorate at the 2006 commencement of [[Brandeis University]]. During the controversy, quotes critical of [[Zionism]] and Israel made by Kushner were circulated. Kushner said at the time that his quotes were "grossly mischaracterized." Kushner told the ''[[Jewish Advocate]]'' in an interview, "All that anybody seems to be reading is a couple of right-wing Web sites taking things deliberately out of context and excluding anything that would complicate the picture by making me seem like a reasonable person, which I basically think I am."<ref>Shayndi Raice. "Brandeis graduation honoree draws fire." ''The Jewish Advocate''. May 4, 2006.</ref> In an interview with the ''Jewish Independent'', Kushner commented, "I want the state of Israel to continue to exist. I've always said that. I've never said anything else. My positions have been lied about and misrepresented in so many ways. People claim that I'm for a [[one-state solution]], which is not true." However, he later stated that he hopes that "there might be a merging of the two countries because [they're] geographically kind of ridiculous looking on a map," although he acknowledged that political realities make this unlikely in the near future.<ref name=JewishIndependent>{{cite news|url=http://www.jewishindependent.ca/archives/Aug07/archives07Aug24-01.html|date=August 24, 2007|title=Tony Kushner as film subject|author=Cynthia Ramsey|publisher=Jewish Independent|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107022644/http://www.jewishindependent.ca/archives/Aug07/archives07Aug24-01.html|archive-date=November 7, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Kushner has even received backlash from family members due to his political views of Israel.<ref>David Zax and Ted Merwin (2007), [http://www.momentmag.com/the-playwrights-politics/ The Playwright's Politics] Moment Magazine</ref>
