Attracted to folk theatre, Nazrul joined a ''leto'' (travelling theatrical group) run by his uncle Fazle Karim. He worked and travelled with them, learning to act, as well as writing songs and poems for the plays and musicals.<ref name=instibio /> Through his work and experiences, Nazrul began studying Bengali and [[Sanskrit literature]], as well as Hindu scriptures such as the [[Puranas]]. Nazrul composed folk plays for the group, which included ''Chāshār Shōng'' ('the drama of a peasant'), and plays about characters from the [[Mahabharata]] including ''Shokunībōdh'' ('the Killing of ''[[Shakun]]i''), Rājā Judhisthirer Shōng ('the drama of King [[Yudhishthira]]), ''Dātā Kōrno'' ('the philanthropic ''[[Karna]]'), Ākbōr Bādshāh'' ('[[Akbar]] the emperor'), ''Kobi Kālidās'' ('poet [[Kalidas]]'), ''Bidyan Hutum'' ('the learned owl'), and ''Rājputrer Shōng'' ('the prince's sorrow').<ref name="Banglapedia" />

In 1910, Nazrul left the troupe and enrolled at the [[Searsole Raj High School]] in [[Raniganj]]. In school, he was influenced by his teacher, a [[Jugantar]] activist, Nibaran Chandra Ghatak, and began a lifelong friendship with fellow author Sailajananda Mukhopadhyay, who was his classmate. He later transferred to the Mathrun High English School, studying under the headmaster and poet [[Kumud Ranjan Mullick]]. Unable to continue paying his school fees, Nazrul left the school and joined a group of [[Kavigan|kaviyals]]. Later he took jobs as a cook at Wahid's, a well-known bakery of the region, and at a tea stall in the town of Asansol. In 1914, Nazrul studied in the Darirampur School (now [[Jatiya Kabi Kazi Nazrul Islam University]]) in [[Trishal]], [[Mymensingh District]]. Amongst other subjects, Nazrul studied Bengali, [[Sanskrit]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian literature]] and [[Hindustani classical music]] under teachers who were impressed by his dedication and skill.<ref name="Banglapedia" /><ref>{{Cite news |date=25 May 2018 |title=Nazrul's birth anniv today |url=http://www.newagebd.net/article/42030/nazruls-birth-anniv-today |access-date=28 June 2018 |work=New Age}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=25 May 2018 |title=Nazrul's 119th birth anniversary today |work=Prothom Alo |url=http://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/news/176241/Nazrul%E2%80%99s-119th-birth-anniversary-today |access-date=28 June 2018}}</ref>

Nazrul studied up to grade{{nbsp}}10 but did not appear for the [[matriculation]] pre-test examination; instead in 1917, he joined the [[British Indian Army]] at the age of eighteen.

During his visit to [[Comilla District|Comilla]] in 1921, Nazrul met a young Bengali Hindu woman, Pramila Devi, with whom he fell in love, and they married on 25 April 1924. [[Brahmo Samaj]] criticised Pramila, a member of the Brahmo Samaj, for marrying a Muslim. Muslim religious leaders criticized Nazrul for his marriage to a Hindu woman.

== Later life ==
In 1930, his book ''Pralayshikhm'' was banned and he faced charges of [[sedition]] by the British Indian colonial government. He was sent to jail and released in 1931, after the [[Gandhi–Irwin Pact]] was signed.<ref name=":2" /> In 1933, Nazrul published a collection of essays titled "Modern World Literature", in which he analyses different styles and themes of literature. Between 1928 and 1935, he published 10 volumes containing 800 songs, of which more than 600 were based on classical ''[[ragas]]''. Almost 100 were folk tunes after ''[[kirtans]]'', and some 30 were patriotic songs. From the time of his return to Kolkata until he fell ill in 1941, Nazrul composed more than 2,600 songs, many of which have been lost.<ref name="MOF2" /> His songs based on ''baul'', ''jhumur'', [[Santali language|Santhali]] folksongs, jhanpan, or the folk songs of [[snake charmers]], ''bhatiali'', and ''bhaoaia'' consist of tunes of folk-songs on the one hand and a refined lyric with poetic beauty on the other. Nazrul also wrote and published poems for children.<ref name="MOF2" />

Nazrul's success soon brought him into Indian theatre and the then-nascent [[Cinema of India|film industry]].<ref name="Banglapedia" /> His first film as a director was ''Dhruva Bhakta,'' which made him the first Muslim director of a Bengali film''.''<ref name=":2" /> The film ''[[Vidyapati (1937 film)|Vidyapati]]'' (Master of Knowledge) was produced based on his recorded play in 1936, and Nazrul served as the music director for the film adaptation of Tagore's novel ''Gora''. Nazrul wrote songs and directed music for [[Sachin Sengupta]]'s biographical epic play based on the life of [[Siraj-ud-Daula]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite news |last=Mallick |first=Sadya Afreen |date=28 August 2015 |title=Nazrul's tryst with Bengali theatre |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/arts-entertainment/event/nazruls-tryst-bengali-theatre-133651 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180704155905/https://www.thedailystar.net/arts-entertainment/event/nazruls-tryst-bengali-theatre-133651 |archive-date=4 July 2018 |access-date=5 March 2016 |work=The Daily Star}}</ref> He worked on the plays "Jahangir" and "Annyapurna" by Monilal Gangopadhyay.<ref name=":1" /> In 1939 Nazrul began working for Calcutta Radio, supervising the production and broadcasting of the station's musical programs. He produced critical and analytic documentaries on music, such as "Haramoni" and "Navaraga-malika". Nazrul also wrote a large variety of songs inspired by the [[raga]] ''Bhairav''.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Islam |first=Rafiqul |title=Nazrul: An Evaluation |date=2000 |publisher=Nazrul Institute |isbn=978-984-555-167-0 |editor-last=Mohammad Nurul Huda |location=Dhaka |page=117 |chapter=Nazrul Islam |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MtpVAAAACAAJ}}</ref>

Nazrul's wife Pramila fell seriously ill in 1939 and was paralysed from the waist down. To provide for his wife's medical treatment, he mortgaged the royalties of his gramophone records and literary works for 400 rupees.<ref name="Kamal 325">{{Cite book |last=Kamal |first=Sajed |title=Nazrul: An Evaluation |date=2000 |publisher=Nazrul Institute |isbn=978-984-555-167-0 |editor-last=Mohammad Nurul Huda |location=Dhaka |page=325 |chapter=Kazi Nazrul Islam: A Chronology of Life |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MtpVAAAACAAJ}}</ref> He returned to journalism in 1940 by working as chief editor for the daily newspaper ''[[Nabajug]]'' ('New Age'), founded by the Bengali politician [[A. K. Fazlul Huq]].<ref name="Kamal 325" />

On hearing about the death of Rabindranath Tagore on 8 August 1941, a shocked Nazrul composed two poems in Tagore's memory. One of the two poems, "Rabihara" (loss of Rabi, or without Rabi), was broadcast on the [[All India Radio]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Huda |first=Muhammad Nurul |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Co9jAAAAMAAJ |title=Nazrul's Aesthetics and Other Aspects |date=2001 |publisher=Nazrul Institute |page=129 |language=en}}</ref> Within months, Nazrul himself fell ill and gradually began losing his power of speech. His behaviour became erratic, he started spending recklessly and fell into financial difficulties. In spite of her own illness, his wife constantly cared for her husband. However, Nazrul's health had seriously deteriorated and he grew increasingly depressed. He received treatment under [[homeopathy]] as well as [[Ayurveda]], but little progress was achieved before mental dysfunction intensified and he was admitted to a mental asylum in 1942. Spending four months there without making progress, Nazrul and his family began living a quiet life in India. In 1952, he was transferred to a psychiatric hospital in [[Ranchi]]. Through the efforts of a large group of admirers who called themselves the "Nazrul Treatment Society",<ref>{{Cite news |date=27 August 2015 |title=10 key events in Kazi Nazrul's life |work=The Daily Star |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/literature/10-key-events-kazi-nazrul%E2%80%99s-life-133459 |access-date=5 February 2016}}</ref> Nazrul and Promila were sent to London, then to Vienna for treatment.<ref name="Kamal 326">{{Cite book |last=Kamal |first=Sajed |title=Nazrul: An Evaluation |date=2000 |publisher=Nazrul Institute |isbn=978-984-555-167-0 |editor-last=Mohammad Nurul Huda |location=Dhaka |page=326 |chapter=Kazi Nazrul Islam: A Chronology of Life |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MtpVAAAACAAJ}}</ref> The examining doctors said he had received poor care, and Dr. [[Hans Hoff (psychiatrist)|Hans Hoff]], a leading [[neurosurgeon]] in Vienna, diagnosed that Nazrul was suffering from [[Pick's disease]].

On 24 May 1972, the newly independent nation of Bangladesh brought Nazrul to live in Dhaka with the consent of the [[Government of India]]. In January 1976, he was accorded the citizenship of Bangladesh.<ref name="Banglapedia" /> Despite receiving treatment and attention, Nazrul's physical and mental health did not improve.

In accordance with a wish he had expressed in one of his poems, he was buried beside a mosque on the campus of the [[University of Dhaka]]. Tens of thousands of people attended his funeral; Bangladesh observed two days of national mourning, and the [[parliament of India]] observed a minute of silence in his honour.<ref>{{Cite web |date=16 October 2007 |title=References to demise of Heads of foreign States or eminent international personalities |url=http://164.100.24.167/rajya/19/94/i5/94I50H02.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325222250/http://164.100.24.167/rajya/19/94/i5/94I50H02.htm |archive-date=25 March 2012 |access-date=13 May 2008}}</ref>

== Criticism ==
According to literary critic [[Serajul Islam Choudhury]], Nazrul's poetry is characterised by abundant use of rhetorical devices, which he employed to convey conviction and sensuousness. He often wrote without care for organisation or polish. His works have often been criticized for [[egotism]], but his admirers counter that they carry more a sense of self-confidence than of ego. They cite his ability to defy God yet maintain an inner, humble devotion to him.<ref name="sedition" /> Nazrul's poetry is regarded as rugged but unique in comparison to Tagore's sophisticated style. Nazrul's use of [[Persian language|Persian]] vocabulary was controversial, but it increased the range of his work.<ref name="sedition" />
