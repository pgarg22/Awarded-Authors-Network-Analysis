'''Festus Claudius "Claude" McKay''' [[Order of Jamaica|OJ]] (September 15, 1890<ref name=":1">See Wayne F. Cooper, ''Claude McKay, Rebel Sojourner In The Harlem Renaissance (New York, Schocken, 1987) p. 377 n. 19.  As Cooper's authoritative biography explains, McKay's family predated his birth a year to make him eligible to be a student teaching assistant at his eldest brother's school, a fact McKay only learned from his sister Rachel in 1920 -- leading some sources to erroneously date his birth to 1889.</ref> – May 22, 1948) was a [[Jamaican Americans|Jamaican-American]] writer and poet, and a central figure in the [[Harlem Renaissance]].

Born in Jamaica, McKay first traveled to the United States to attend college, and encountered [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]'s ''[[The Souls of Black Folk]]'' which stimulated McKay's interest in political involvement. He moved to New York City in 1914 and in 1919 wrote "[[If We Must Die]]", one of his best known works, a widely reprinted sonnet responding to the wave of white-on-black race riots and lynchings following the conclusion of the First World War.

A poet from the first, he also wrote five novels and a novella: ''Home to Harlem'' (1928), a best-seller that won the [[William E. Harmon Foundation award for distinguished achievement among Negroes|Harmon Gold Award]] for Literature; ''Banjo'' (1929); ''Banana Bottom'' (1933); ''[[Romance in Marseille]]'' (written in 1933, published in 2020), a novella, ''Harlem Glory'' (written in 1938-1940, published in 1990), and in 1941 a novel, ''Amiable With Big Teeth: A Novel of the Love Affair Between the Communists and the Poor Black Sheep of Harlem'', which remained unpublished until 2017.<ref name="NYTimes">Felicia R. Lee, [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/15/books/harlem-renaissance-novel-by-claude-mckay-is-discovered.html "New Novel of Harlem Renaissance Is Found"], ''The New York Times'', September 14, 2012.</ref>

Besides these novels and four published collections of poetry, McKay also authored a collection of short stories, ''Gingertown'' (1932); two autobiographical books, ''A Long Way from Home'' (1937) and ''My Green Hills of Jamaica'' (published posthumously in 1979); and ''Harlem: Negro Metropolis'' (1940), consisting of eleven essays on the contemporary social and political history of Harlem and Manhattan, concerned especially with political, social and labor organizing. His 1922 poetry collection, ''Harlem Shadows'', was among the first books published during the Harlem Renaissance and his novel ''Home To Harlem'' was a watershed contribution to its fiction. His ''Selected Poems'' was published posthumously, in 1953.  His ''Complete Poems'' (2004) includes almost ninety pages of poetry written between 1923 and the late 1940s, most of it previously unpublished, a crucial addition to his poetic oeuvre.

McKay was introduced to British [[Fabian socialism]] in his teens by his schoolteacher elder brother and tutor and after moving to the United States in his early 20s encountered the American socialist left in the work of W. E. B. Du Bois and through his membership in the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) — the only American left-labor organization of the era that was totally open to Negro members (as he comments), continuing the tradition of the populist People's Party of the previous generation.  In the course of the teens he became acquainted with the writings of Marx and the programs of a variety of activists.  As a co-editor of ''[[The Liberator (magazine)|The Liberator]]'' magazine, he came into conflict with its hard-line Leninist doctrinaire editor Mike Gold, a contention which contributed to his leaving the magazine.  In 1922–1923 he traveled to the Soviet Union to attend a Congress of the International, there encountering his friend ''Liberator'' publisher Max Eastman, a delegate to the Congress.  In Russia, McKay was widely feted by the Communist Party.  While there, he worked with a Russian writer to produce two books which were published in Russian, ''The Negroes of America'' (1923), a critical examination of American black-white racism from a Marxist class-conflict perspective, and ''Trial By Lynching'' (1925); translations of these books back into English appeared in 1979 and 1977 respectively; McKay's original English texts are apparently lost.  In the Soviet Union McKay eventually concluded that, as he says of a character in ''Harlem Glory,'' he "saw what he was shown."  Realizing that he was being manipulated and used by the Party apparatus, and responding critically to the authoritarian bent of the Soviet regime, he left for Western Europe in 1923, first for Hamburg, then Paris, then the South of France, Barcelona and Morocco.

After his return to Harlem in 1934 he found himself in frequent contention with the Stalinist New York City Communist Party which sought to dominate the left politics and writing community of the decade.  His prose masterpiece, ''A Long Way From Home,'' was attacked in the New York City press on doctrinaire Stalinist grounds.  This conflict is reflected in ''Harlem: Negro Metropolis'' and satirized in ''Amiable With Big Teeth.''  His sonnet seqence, "The Cycle," published posthumously in the ''Complete Poems,'' deals at length with McKay's confrontation with the left political machine of the time.  Increasingly ill in the mid-40s,he was rescued from extremely impoverished circumstances by a Catholic Worker friend and installed in a communal living situation; later in the decade he converted to Catholicism.<ref>Cooper, Wayne F.

== Biography ==

===Early life in Jamaica ===
Festus Claudius McKay, known as Claude McKay, was born September 15, 1890 in Nairne Castle near [[James Hill, Jamaica|James Hill]] in upper [[Clarendon, Jamaica|Clarendon Parish, Jamaica]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=James|first=Winston|date=April 18, 2003|title=Becoming the People's Poet: Claude McKay's Jamaican Years, 1889–1912 |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/41262|journal=Small Axe|volume=7|issue=1|pages=17–45|doi=10.1353/smx.2003.0009|s2cid=201775746|issn=1534-6714}}</ref> He referred to his home village as Sunny Ville, a name given to the area by locals.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 271657|title = Boyhood in Jamaica|journal = Phylon |volume = 14|issue = 2|pages = 134–145|last1 = McKay|first1 = Claude|year = 1953|doi = 10.2307/271657}}</ref> He was the youngest child of Thomas Francis McKay and Hannah Ann Elizabeth Edwards, well-to-do farmers who had enough property to qualify to vote. He had seven siblings.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|title=Claude McKay, A Black Poet's Struggle for Identity|last=Tillery|first=Tyrone|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|year=1992|location=Amherst|isbn=0870237624|pages=4, 5, 6, 9}}</ref> McKay's parents were active and well-respected members of the Baptist faith. Thomas was a strict, religious man who struggled to develop close relationships with his children due to his serious nature. In contrast, Hannah had a warmth that allowed her to give love freely to all of her children. Thomas was of [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] descent, while Hannah traced her ancestry to [[Madagascar]]. Claude recounted that his father would often share stories of Ashanti customs with the family.<ref>Tillery, Tyrone. ''Claude Mckay : A Black Poet's Struggle for Identity''. University of Massachusetts Press, 1992.</ref>

At the age of four, McKay went to school at Mt. Zion Church. Around the age of nine, he was sent to live with his oldest brother, Uriah Theodore, also known as Theo, a teacher, to be given a proper education. His brother was also an amateur journalist.<ref name=":3" /> Due to his brother's influence, McKay became an avid reader of classical and British literature, as well as philosophy, science, and theology.<ref name="Cooper">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FfAeCHw5Q1AC&q=writing+poetry&pg=PA379|title=Claude McKay, Rebel Sojourner in the Harlem Renaissance: A Biography|last=Cooper|first=Wayne F.|date=February 1, 1996|publisher=LSU Press|isbn=9780807120743|language=en}}</ref> In his free time, he would read poems, including Shakespeare. He started writing poetry of his own at the age of 10.<ref name=":3" />

As a teenager in 1906, he became apprenticed to a carriage and cabinet maker known as Old Brenda, maintaining his apprenticeship for about two years. During that time, in 1907, McKay met a man named [[Walter Jekyll]], who became a mentor and an inspiration for him, who also encouraged him to concentrate on his writing. Jekyll convinced McKay to write in his native dialect, and set some of McKay's verses to music. Jekyll helped McKay publish his first book of poems, ''[[Songs of Jamaica]]'', in 1912. They were the first poems published in [[Jamaican Patois]], a dialect of mainly English words and [[Twi]] (Ghanaian language) structure. McKay's next volume, ''Constab Ballads'' (1912), was based on his experiences of joining the [[Jamaica Constabulary Force|constabulary]] for a brief period in 1911.<ref>{{cite web|author=Em |url=http://claudemckay.blogspot.co.uk/2007/04/biography-mckays-jamaica-years-still.html |title=Biography, McKay's Jamaica Years, Still Further Continued|publisher= The Dialect Poetry of Claude McKay |date=February 26, 2004 |access-date=December 4, 2013}}</ref><ref>Freda Scott Giles, [http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/m_r/mckay/life.htm "Claude McKay's Life"], ''Modern American Poetry''.</ref>

In the poem "The Tropics in New York", McKay reminisced about the Caribbean.<ref>{{Cite book|title="The Tropics in New York" from The New Negro|last=McKay|first=Claude|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=1992|isbn=0-684-83831-1|location=New York|pages=135}}</ref> The poem is set in New York and was written while McKay lived there as a laborer. The fruits he sees in New York make the speaker of the poem long for Jamaica, and thus Caribbean fruits are imagined as part of the New York cityscape. The colors of the fruit remind him of the colors and diversity in his native island and "hungry for old familiar ways / a wave of longing through my body wept".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://study.com/academy/lesson/claude-mckay-role-in-harlem-renaissance-america-analysis.html|title=Claude McKay: Role in Harlem Renaissance & 'America' Analysis - Video & Lesson Transcript|website=Study.com|language=en|access-date=January 25, 2020}}</ref>

===First stay in the US===
McKay left for the US in 1912 to attend [[Tuskegee Institute]] (now Tuskegee University). He was shocked by the intense [[racism]] he encountered when he arrived in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], where many public facilities were [[racial segregation|segregated]]; this inspired him to write more poetry. At Tuskegee, he disliked the "semi-military, machine-like existence there" and quickly left to study at [[Kansas State Agricultural College]] (now Kansas State University). At Kansas State, he read [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]' ''[[The Souls of Black Folk]]'', which had a major impact on him and stirred his political involvement. Despite his superior academic performance, in 1914 he decided he did not want to be an [[agronomist]] and moved to [[New York City]], where he married his childhood sweetheart Eulalie Imelda Edwards. However, after only six months of marriage, his wife returned to Jamaica, where their daughter Ruth was born. McKay would never meet his daughter.<ref>Rafia Zafar (ed.), ''Harlem Renaissance. Five Novels of the 1920s'', [[Library of America]], 2011, p. 846.</ref> As detailed in the Chronology of Gene Andrew Jarrett's 2007 edition of ''A Long Way From Home,'' during this period (1914-1919) McKay first managed a Brooklyn restaurant, which failed, next worked as a waiter at a hotel in Hanover, New Hampshire, then at a Manhattan women's club, and longest and most happily as a waiter on the Pennsylvania Railroad.

{{Left communism sidebar}}
McKay published two poems in 1917 in ''[[The Seven Arts]]'' under the pseudonym Eli Edwards.  In 1918 McKay met Frank Harris, then editor of ''[[Pearson's Magazine]].'' His avowal of writerly integrity had a lifelong effect for McKay, as he relates in his memoir, ''A Long Way From Home''.  Harris featured four poems and a short prose piece about his biography and poetics, in the September 1918 issue of the magazine, McKay's first prominent appearance in print.  In 1919, McKay met [[Crystal Eastman|Crystal]] and [[Max Eastman]], publishers of ''[[The Liberator(socialist)|The Liberator]]'' magazine, where McKay would serve as co-executive editor until 1922.<ref>''The Chicago Defender'' (National edition) (1921–1967); April 2, 1921; ProQuest Historical Newspapers: ''Chicago Defender'' (1910-1975), p. 1.</ref> As co-editor of ''The Liberator'', he published one of his most famous poems, "[[If We Must Die]]", during the "[[Red Summer]]", a period of intense racial violence against black people in Anglo-American societies.

In this period McKay joined the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW).<ref name="Cooper" /> He also became involved with a group of black [[Far left|radicals]] who were unhappy both with [[Marcus Garvey]]'s [[black nationalism|nationalism]] and the [[middle-class]] reformist [[NAACP]]. These included other Caribbean writers such as [[Cyril Briggs]], [[Richard B. Moore]], and [[Wilfred Domingo]]. They fought for black self-determination within the context of [[socialism|socialist]] revolution. Together they founded a semi-secret revolutionary organization, the [[African Blood Brotherhood]]. [[Hubert Harrison]] had asked McKay to write for Garvey's ''[[Negro World]]'', but only a few copies of the paper have survived from this period, none of which contain any articles by McKay. In early fall 1919 McKay traveled to [[London]], perhaps prompted by pressure from the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] which was engaged in a nationwide attack on pacifists, socialists and labor organizers (the "Palmer Raids") which especially targeted the IWW.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Tillery|first=|title=Claude McKay: A Black Poet's Struggle for Identity|publisher=|year=1992|isbn=|pages=42}}</ref>

===Sojourn in the United Kingdom===
In London McKay moved in socialist and literary circles; he frequented two clubs, a soldiers' club in [[Drury Lane]], and the [[International Socialist Club]] in [[Shoreditch]]. A militant atheist, he also joined the [[Rationalist Press Association]]. It was during this period that his commitment to socialism deepened and he read [[Marx]] assiduously. At the International Socialist Club, McKay met [[Shapurji Saklatvala]], [[A. J. Cook (trade unionist)|A. J. Cook]], [[Guy Aldred]], [[Jack Tanner (trade unionist)|Jack Tanner]], [[Arthur McManus]], [[Willie Gallacher (politician)|William Gallacher]], [[Sylvia Pankhurst]], and [[George Lansbury]]. McKay was soon invited to write for Pankhurst's magazine, ''[[Workers' Dreadnought]]''.

In April 1920, the ''[[Daily Herald (UK newspaper)|Daily Herald]]'', a socialist paper published by George Lansbury, included a [[Racism|racist]] article written by [[E. D. Morel]]. Entitled "[[Black shame|Black Scourge in Europe: Sexual Horror Let Loose by France on the Rhine]]", it insinuated gross [[hypersexuality]] in [[black people]] in general. Lansbury refused to print McKay's response,<ref>{{cite journal|date=2016|title="A Black Man Replies": Claude McKay's Challenge to the British Left|url=http://csalateral.org/wp/issue/5-1/claude-mckay-british-left-donlon/|journal=Lateral |volume=5|issue=1|last1=Donlon|first1=Anne|doi=10.25158/L5.1.2|access-date=June 16, 2016|doi-access=free}}</ref> so McKay did so in ''Workers' Dreadnought'', writing:

<blockquote>Why this obscene maniacal outburst about the sex vitality of black men in a proletarian paper? Rape is rape; the colour of the skin doesn't make it different. Negroes are no more over-sexed than Caucasians; mulatto children in the West Indies and America were not the result of parthenogenesis. If Negro troops had syphilis, they contracted it from the white and yellow races. As for German women, in their economic plight, they were selling themselves to anyone. I do not protest because I happen to be a Negro... I write because I feel that the ultimate result of your propaganda will be further strife and blood-spilling between whites and the many members of my race... who have been dumped down on the English docks since the ending of the European war... Bourbons of the United States will thank you, and the proletarian underworld of London will certainly gloat over the scoop of the Christian-Socialist pacifist ''Daily Herald''.<ref>Reindeers, Robert, "Racialism on the Left: E.D. Morel and the 'Black Horror on the Rhine'", ''International Review of Social History'', Volume 13, 1968 (pp. 1–28), p. 17.</ref></blockquote>

Since January 1920, McKay had been involved with the ''Workers' Dreadnought'' and the [[Workers' Socialist Federation]], a [[Council Communist]] group active in the [[East End of London|East End]] with a majority of women at all levels of the organization (this was the British Communist Party, not the Soviet International's). He became a paid journalist for the paper.  He attended the [[Communist Unity Conference]] that established the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]]. At this time he also had some of his poetry published in the ''[[Cambridge Magazine]]'', edited by [[C. K. Ogden]].

When Sylvia Pankhurst was arrested under the [[Defence of the Realm Act]] for publishing articles "calculated and likely to cause sedition among His Majesty's forces, in the Navy, and among the civilian population," McKay had his rooms searched. He is likely to have been the author of "The Yellow Peril and the Dockers" attributed to "Leon Lopez", which was one of the articles cited by the government in its case against ''Workers' Dreadnought''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cooper|first=Wayne F.|title=Claude McKay, Rebel Sojourner in the Harlem Renaissance: A Biography|publisher=LSU Press|year=1996|isbn=080712074X|pages=123}}</ref>

===Trip to Russia===
[[File: Grigory Zinoviev, Nikolai Bukharin and Claude McKay in 1923.jpg|thumb|McKay with [[Grigory Zinoviev]] and [[Nikolai Bukharin]] in 1923]]
McKay was invited to Russia during the reconstruction of the country by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] led by [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]].<ref>{{Cite book | publisher = Duke University Press | isbn =978-0-8223-2976-3 | last = Baldwin | first = Kate A. | title = Beyond the Color Line and the Iron Curtain: Reading Encounters between Black and Red, 1922-1963 | location = Durham, N.C. | year = 2002 | pages = 28–32 }}</ref> In November 1922, in what he referred to as his "Magic Pilgrimage," he traveled to Russia to take part in the Fourth Congress of the Communist International in Petrograd and Moscow—where he encountered Max Eastman, also a delegate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://links.org.au/node/2983|title=Communist International's Fourth Congress: revolutionary fulcrum of the modern world {{!}} Links International Journal of Socialist Renewal|website=links.org.au|language=en|access-date=August 18, 2017}}</ref> McKay financed his trip to Russia by repackaging and selling ''Harlem Shadows'', "complete with a signed photograph and an inflated price tag" to members of an NAACP donor list and conserved the funds thus raised by working his way across the Atlantic from New York to Liverpool as a stoker on a freighter.

===Later travels===
McKay wrote about his travels in [[Morocco]] in his 1937 autobiography ''A Long Way from Home.'' Before this journey, he went to Paris, where he contracted a severe respiratory infection and required hospitalization. After recovering he continued traveling, and for 11 years ventured around Europe and parts of Northern Africa.<ref name=PoetryFoundation /> During this stint he published three novels, the most notable of which was ''Home to Harlem'', in 1928. Reception to the novel varied. In ''[[The Negro Novel in America]]'' [[Robert Bone]] thought that it represented "different ways of rebelling against Western civilization", adding that McKay was not entirely successful in articulating his protagonists. However, other people{{Specify|date=November 2019}} thought that the novel provided a detailed portrayal of the underside of black urban life, with its prostitutes and gamblers.

He also wrote ''Banana Bottom'' during this 11-year span. Here McKay presented a clear depiction{{According to whom|date=May 2019}} of his principal theme, that black individuals quest for cultural identity in a white society. His final year abroad saw the creation of ''Gingertown'', a collection of 12 short stories. Half of these tales depict his life in Harlem and the others revolve around his time in Jamaica.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/claude-mckay |title=Claude McKay (1889-1948) |publisher=Poetry Foundation |access-date=April 21, 2021}}</ref>

===Later life===
McKay became an American citizen in 1940.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}

In 1943 McKay started "Cycle Manuscript", a collection of 54 poems, all but four of them sonnets, often with political subjects and often in tones of satiric invective.  After the manuscript was rejected by Harper and Dutton, he wrote to his old friend and editor [[Max Eastman]], asking him "to look through" all the poems and to make any needed revisions. Despite Eastman's efforts, McKay's collection would never be published during his lifetime but is now included in his posthumous ''Complete Poems.''  Its editor William J. Maxwell discusses this manuscript's history in an extended note.  In the mid-40s McKay began to associate with Catholic cultural activists and studied Catholic social theory, first in New York City and then in Chicago where he moved in April 1944; he was baptized there in October 1944.<ref>James, Winston (2001). ''A Fierce Hatred of Injustice: Claude McKay's Jamaica and His Poetry of Rebellion'' (London: Verso Books), p. 46.</ref>  Before his conversion, he had written to Max Eastman, about "doing a lot of reading and research, especially on Catholic work among Negroes—Because if and when I take the step I want to be intellectually honest and sincere about it". (McKay to Eastman, June 1, 1944). Five months after his baptism, he wrote Eastman to assure him that "I am not less the fighter." (McKay to Eastman, October 16, 1944, Rpt. in Passion 305).<ref>{{Cite document|last=Deshmukh|first=Madhuri|date=Winter 2014|title=Claude Mckay's Road to Catholicism|id={{ProQuest|1513343887}}}}</ref> In 1946, advised to seek a better climate for his health, he moved first to Albuquerque and then to San Francisco, before returning to Chicago in 1947.

On May 22, 1948, he died from a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in Chicago at the age of 58 and was buried at [[Calvary Cemetery (Queens)|Calvary Cemetery]] in [[Queens]], New York.<ref>Wilson, Scott.

==Literary movements and traditions==
[[File: Claude McKay 1920.jpg|thumb|Portrait of McKay in 1920]]

McKay flourished as a poet during the [[Harlem Renaissance]] in the 1920s. During this time, his poems challenged white authority while celebrating Jamaican culture. He also wrote tales about the trials and tribulations of life as a black man in both Jamaica and America. McKay was not secretive about his hatred for racism,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/people/literature-and-arts/american-literature-biographies/claude-mckay|title=Claude McKay facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about Claude McKay|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=August 18, 2017}}</ref> and felt that racist people were stupid, and could not look past their shortsightedness and hatred.<ref name=PoetryFoundation>{{Cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/claude-mckay|title=Claude McKay|publisher=[[Poetry Foundation]]|access-date=January 16, 2018}}</ref> In tales such as ''Home to Harlem'' (1928), his depictions were initially criticized as a negative portrayal of Harlem and its lower-class citizens by prominent figures such as [[W. E. B. DuBois]], but McKay was later applauded as a literary force in the Harlem Renaissance.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2838/is_3_34/ai_67413397|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120527075905/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2838/is_3_34/ai_67413397|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 27, 2012|title=Haiti and Black Transnationalism: Remapping the Migrant Geography of ... |date=May 27, 2012|work=archive.is|access-date=August 18, 2017}}</ref>

Among his works that challenged racial discrimination is the poem "[[If We Must Die]]" (1919), a call for his people to fight with determination and courage against those who would murder them.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Claude McKay, Rebel Sojourner in the Harlem Renaissance: A Biography|last=Cooper|first=Wayne F.|pages=122–123}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/m_r/mckay/mustdie.htm|title=Mckay on "If We Must Die"|website=Modern American Poetry|access-date=May 24, 2018}}</ref>

McKay divested himself from many aspects and growing prescriptions of [[modernism]].<!--McKay paved a path of his own as a modernist in two ways.--> By the beginning of the 20th century, the [[sonnet]] form had become an antiquated poetic style, but McKay found it an ideal medium to convey his ideas. Many modernists, however, rejected and criticized his use of the sonnet.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Modernism and Race.|last=Platt|first=Len|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011}}</ref> Despite their reaction, he persevered and created a significant number of modern sonnets.

Having spent time among the artists of Paris in the 1920s, he was intimately acquainted with the dynamics between painters and models and how modernist painters presented African subjects and African culture. In her article "Caribbean Models for Modernism in the Work of Claude McKay and Jean Rhys", Leah Rosenberg writes: "The fascination with African art and its identification with female sexuality was characteristic of modernist and [[avant-garde]] [[primitivism]]".<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Rosenberg|first=Leah|title=Caribbean Models for Modernism in the Work of Claude McKay and Jean Rhys.|journal=Modernism/Modernity|volume=11|pages=220}}</ref> The inclination to stereotype and caricature the African physical form created, however inadvertently, a form of [[hegemony]] reminiscent to McKay of the colonialism he grew up within Jamaica. "Sexuality and black culture," Rosenberg explains, "held a privileged place in modernist and avant-garde art from [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] to [[Gertrude Stein]]". In need of money, McKay posed nude for the Cubist painter [[André Lhote]]. Through his experience, McKay saw first-hand how the larger social hegemony between European [[white supremacy]] and people of [[Afro-Caribbean]] descent could play itself out between the artist and its subject. McKay critically recalled the experience in various ways in many of his most notable works. In doing so, he shone a critical light on a cornerstone of modernism and once again pushed back against a system in which he found himself.

==Political views and social activism==
McKay joined the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] in autumn 1919 while working in a factory following his time as a dining-car waiter on the railways.<ref name="Cooper"/> McKay believed that the Communists in the US had other things on their agenda, which did not include African Americans. Furthermore, he thought that they were using the [[Negro]] race to fight their battles. During his visit to the Soviet Union he addressed the Third International in a speech, "Report on the Negro Question" and argued that America was not fully accepting of the Negro Communists.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McKay|first=Claude|date=1923|title=Report on the Negro Question|url=http://www.marxisthistory.org/history/usa/groups/abb/1922/1100-mckay-cominternspeech.pdf|journal=International Press Correspondence|volume=3|pages=16–17}}</ref>  After this speech,he was asked by the Communist Party in Russia to explore this idea more in the form of a book. He wrote ''Negry v Amerike'' in 1923. Originally in Russian, and it was not translated into English until 1979.

==Personal life==
===Sexuality===
McKay was [[Bisexuality|bisexual]]; he pursued relationships with both men and women throughout his life. He never officially "came out" (nor did anyone else in his time) nor explicitly stated his sexual preference, but over the years he appears to have frequented and enjoyed the "clandestine" homosexual communities of New York as well as relationships of intermediate duration with several women.  According to his biographer, Wayne Cooper, Frank and Francine Budgen, whom he knew during his stay in London in 1920 remembered him as "open" about his sexuality and as "not at all effeminate." Several of his poems suggest [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] sentiments. In others, the [[gender]] of the speaker is not identified, which leaves to interpretation the nature of the relationships presented.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tuggle|first=Lindsay|date=2008|title="A Love So Fugitive and So Complete": Recovering the Queer Subtext of Claude McKay's Harlem Shadows|url=https://www.monmouth.edu/the_space_between/articles/LindsayTuggle2008.pdf|journal=The Space Between|volume=IV:I|pages=63–81|access-date=August 18, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819015535/https://www.monmouth.edu/the_space_between/articles/LindsayTuggle2008.pdf|archive-date=August 19, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>  Some suggest that there was a sexual component to McKay's relationship with his mentor, [[Walter Jekyll]], who was apparently homosexual but there is no evidence one way or the other.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Claude Mckay: A Black Poet's Struggle For Identity|last=Tillery|first=|page=12}}</ref> In the early 1920s McKay was intermittently involved with the English labor advocate and IWW organizer, poet, and translator [[Charles Ashleigh]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Rambling Kid|last=Ashleigh|first=Charles|publisher=Charles H.

==Works==
In 1928, McKay published his most famous novel, ''Home to Harlem'', which won the Harmon Gold Award for Literature. The novel, which depicted street life in [[Harlem]], would have a major impact on black intellectuals in the [[Caribbean]], [[West Africa]], and Europe.<ref name="findarticles.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2838/is_3_34/ai_67413397 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120527075905/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2838/is_3_34/ai_67413397 |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 27, 2012 |title=Haiti and Black Transnationalism: Remapping the Migrant Geography of Home to Harlem - Critical Essay &#124; African American Review &#124; Find Articles at BNET.com |publisher=Findarticles.com |access-date=December 4, 2013 }}</ref>

''Home to Harlem'' gained a substantial readership, especially among people who wanted to know more about the intense, sometimes shocking, details of Harlem nightlife. His novel was an attempt to capture the energetic and intense spirit of the "uprooted black [[Vagabond (person)|vagabonds]]." In ''Home to Harlem,'' McKay looked among the common people for a distinctive black identity.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}

Despite this, the book drew fire from one of McKay's contemporaries, [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. To Du Bois, the novel's frank depictions of sexuality and the nightlife in Harlem only appealed to the "prurient demand[s]" of white readers and publishers looking for portrayals of black "licentiousness." As Du Bois said, "''Home to Harlem''... for the most part nauseates me, and after the dirtier parts of its filth I feel distinctly like taking a bath."<ref name="findarticles.com"/> Modern critics now dismiss this criticism from Du Bois, who was more concerned with using art as [[propaganda]] in the struggle for African-American political liberation than in the value of art to showcase the truth about the lives of black people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.press.jhu.edu/books/hopkins_guide_to_literary_theory/free/african-american_theory_and_criticism-_1.html |title=The Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism |publisher=Press.jhu.edu |access-date=December 4, 2013}}</ref>

McKay's other novels were ''Banjo'' (1929) and ''Banana Bottom'' (1933). ''Banjo'' was noted in part for its portrayal of how the [[French people|French]] treated people from its sub-Saharan African colonies, as the novel centers on black seamen in [[Marseilles]]. [[Aimé Césaire]] stated that in ''Banjo'', blacks were described truthfully and without "inhibition or [[prejudice]]". ''Banana Bottom'', McKay's third novel, is said to follow a principal theme of a black individual in search of establishing a cultural identity in a white society. The book discusses the underlying racial and cultural tensions.

McKay also authored a collection of short stories, ''Gingertown'' (1932), two [[autobiographical]] books, ''A Long Way from Home'' (1937) and ''My Green Hills of Jamaica'' (published posthumously in 1979), and a non-fiction, socio-historical treatise entitled ''Harlem: Negro Metropolis'' (1940). His ''Selected Poems'' (1953) represents his selection and arrangement of 1947, but he was unable to find a publisher for it and it appeared posthumously six years later.  According to Amardeep Singh's website, ''Claude McKay's Early Poetry,'' it was originally published by Bookman & Associates in 1953 with an introduction by John Dewey and subsequently reprinted by [[Harcourt Brace]] with the Dewey introduction replaced by a biographical note by Max Eastman.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Black Voices: An Anthology of African-American Literature|publisher=Signet|year=2001|isbn=0451527828|editor-last=Chapman|editor-first=Abraham|pages=362}}</ref>

===Unknown manuscript===
A previously unknown manuscript of a 1941 novel by McKay was authenticated in 2012. Entitled ''Amiable With Big Teeth: A Novel of the Love Affair Between the Communists and the Poor Black Sheep of Harlem'', the manuscript was discovered in 2009 by [[Columbia University|Columbia]] graduate student Jean-Christophe Cloutier in the [[Samuel Roth]] Papers, a previously untouched university archive. The novel centers on the ideas and events that animated Harlem on the cusp of World War II, such as [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|invasion of Ethiopia]].

Professor Cloutier (now at the University of Pennsylvania) and his advisor Professor [[Brent Hayes Edwards]] successfully authenticated the manuscript, and have received permission from the McKay estate to publish the novel, a satire set in 1936, with an introduction about how it was found and its provenance verified.<ref name="NYTimes" />

It was published in February 2017.
