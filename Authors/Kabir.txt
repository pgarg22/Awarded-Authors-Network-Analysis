==Early life and background==

Kabir Saheb was born in 1398 (Samvat 1455), on the full moon day of Jyeshtha month at the time of Brahmamuharta. Followers believe that Kabir came from Satlok by assuming the body of light and incarnated on a lotus flower and claim that Rishi Ashtanand Ji was the direct witness of this incident, who himself appeared on a lotus flower in the lake "Lahartara".{{citation needed|date=October 2021}} In fact, there is a Kabirpanth on the Lahartara lake today which reinforces this very belief.

Kabir is widely believed to have become one of the many disciples of the Bhakti poet-sant Swami [[Ramananda]] in Varanasi, known for devotional [[Vaishnavism]] with a strong bent to [[monism|monist]] Advaita philosophy teaching that God was inside every person, everything.<ref name="Tinker1990"/><ref>{{cite book | last=Pande | first=Rekha | title=Divine Sounds from the Heart-Singing Unfettered in their Own Voices | publisher=Cambridge Scholars | year=2010 | isbn=978-1-4438-2525-2 | oclc=827209160 | page=77}}</ref><ref name=ronald>{{cite book | last=McGregor | first=Ronald | title=Hindi literature from its beginnings to the nineteenth century | publisher=Harrassowitz | year=1984 | isbn=978-3-447-02413-6 | oclc=11445402 | pages=43–44}}</ref> Early texts about his life place him with Vaishnava tradition of Hinduism as well as the Sufi tradition of Islam.<ref>{{cite book|title=A history of Sufism in India|last=Rizvi|first=Saiyid Athar Abbas|publisher=Manoharlal|year=1983|volume=2|page=412|oclc=174667236|quote=The author of the ''Dabistan-i Mazahib'' placed Kabir against the background of the legends of the Vaishnavite ''vairagis'' (mendicants) with whom he was identified, but a contemporary of his, Shaikh 'Abdu'r-Rahman Chisti, combined both the ''Bairagi'' and the ''muwwahid'' traditions about Kabir in his ''Mir'atu'l-asrar'' and also made him a Firdaussiya Sufi.}}</ref> According to Irfan Habib, the two manuscript versions of the Persian text ''Dabistan-i-Mazahib'' are the earliest known texts with biographical information about Kabir.<ref name=ihabib>{{cite journal|author = Irfan Habib| title= A Fragmentary Exploration of an Indian Text on Religions and Sects: Notes on the Earlier Version of the Dabistan-i-Mazahib| journal= Proceedings of the Indian History Congress| volume=61| year=2001| pages= 479–480| jstor= 44148125}}</ref> The ''Dabistan-i-Mazahib'' states Kabir is a "Bairagi" (Vaishnava yogi) and states he is a disciple of Ramanand (the text refers to him repeatedly as "Gang"). 

Kabir's family is believed to have lived in the locality of [[Kabir Chaura]] in [[Varanasi|Varanasi (Banaras)]]. ''Kabīr [[matha|maṭha]]'' ({{lang|sa|कबीरमठ}}), a ''maṭha'' located in the back alleys of Kabir Chaura, celebrates his life and times.{{sfn|Schomer|McLeod|1987|p=291}} Accompanying the property is a house named ''Nīrūṭīlā'' ({{lang|sa|नीरू टीला}}) which houses Niru and Nima graves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kabirchaura.com/math/math11.htm |title=Jab Mein Tha Tab Hari Nahin' Ab |publisher=Kabirchaura.com |access-date=12 July 2012}}</ref>

Where spring, the lord of seasons reigneth, there the unstruck music sounds of itself,
There the streams of light flow in all directions, few are the men who can cross to that shore!
There, where millions of [[Krishna]]s stand with hands folded,
Where millions of [[Vishnu]]s bow their heads, where millions of [[Brahma]]s are reading the Vedas,

Kabir and his followers named his verbally composed poems of wisdom as "bāņīs" (utterances). These include songs and couplets, called variously ''[[Doha (poetry)|dohe]]'', ''śalokā'' (Sanskrit: ślokā), or ''sākhī'' (Sanskrit: sākṣī). The latter term means "witness", implying the poems to be evidence of the Truth.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kumar|first=Sehdev|title=The Vision of Kabir: Love Poems of a 15th Century Weaver-sage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yTlrwgEACAAJ|year=1984|publisher=Alpha & Omega|page=48}}</ref>

Literary works with compositions attributed to Kabir include ''Kabir Bijak'', ''Kabir Parachai'', ''Sakhi Granth'', ''Adi Granth'' (Sikh), and ''Kabir Granthawali'' (Rajasthan).{{sfn|Lorenzen|1991|pp=18-19}} However, except for Adi Granth, significantly different versions of these texts exist and it is unclear which one is more original; for example, ''Kabir Bijak'' exists in two major recensions.<ref name=classekabir>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Literary Translation into English|last=Classe|first=Olive|editor1-first=Olive|editor1-last=Classe|date=2000|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-203-82550-1|volume=A-L|page=746|doi=10.4324/9780203825501}}</ref> The most in depth scholarly analysis of various versions and translations are credited to Charlotte Vaudeville, the 20th century French scholar on Kabir.<ref name=classekabir/>

===Authenticity===
Numerous poems are attributed to Kabir, but scholars now doubt the authenticity of many songs credited to him.{{sfn|Hess|Singh|2002|p=6}}

[[Rabindranath Tagore]]'s English translation and compilation ''One Hundred Poems of Kabir'' was first published in 1915, and has been a classic reprinted and widely circulated particularly in the West.{{sfn|Schomer|McLeod|1987|pp=167–169}}{{sfn|Tagore|Underhill|1915}} Scholars believe only six{{sfn|Schomer|McLeod|1987|p=173|ps=: The authentic poems are poem 15, 32, 34, 35, 69 and 94.}} of its hundred poems are authentic,{{sfn|Schomer|McLeod|1987|p=172}} and they have questioned whether Tagore introduced then prevalent theological perspectives onto Kabir, as he translated poems in early 20th century that he presumed to be of Kabir's.{{sfn|Schomer|McLeod|1987|pp=168, 178–179}} The unauthentic poems nevertheless belong to the [[Bhakti movement]] in medieval India, and may have been composed by admirers of Kabir who lived later.{{sfn|Schomer|McLeod|1987|pp=167–169}}

===Philosophy===
According to Linda Hess, "Some modern commentators have tried to present Kabir as a synthesizer of Hinduism and Islam; but the picture is a false one. While drawing on various traditions as he saw fit, Kabir emphatically declared his independence from both the major religions of his countrymen, vigorously attacked what he considered the follies of these religions, and tried to kindle the fire of a similar autonomy and courage in those who claimed to be his disciples.{{sfn|Hess|Singh|2002|p=5}} He adopted their terminology and concepts, but vigorously criticized them both.{{sfn|Hess|Singh|2002|pp=5-6}}{{sfn | Lorenzen | Muñoz | 2012 | pp=27-28}} He questioned the need for any holy book, as stated in Kabir Granthavali as follows:
 
{{Quote

Reading book after book the whole world died,
and none ever became learned!
But understanding the root matter is what made them gain the knowledge!
</poem>
|Kabir Granthavali, XXXIII.3|Translated by Charlotte Vaudeville{{sfn|Schomer|McLeod|1987|p=23}} }}

Many scholars interpret Kabir's philosophy to be questioning the need for religion, rather than attempting to propose either [[Hindu–Muslim unity]] or an independent synthesis of a new religious tradition.{{sfn | Lorenzen | Muñoz | 2012 | p=35}} Kabir rejected the hypocrisy and misguided rituals evident in various religious practices of his day, including those in Islam and Hinduism.{{sfn | Lorenzen | Muñoz | 2012 | p=35}}

{{Quote
|<poem>
Saints I've seen both ways.
Hindus and Muslims don't want discipline, they want tasty food.
The Hindu keeps the eleventh-day fast, eating chestnuts and milk.
He curbs his grain but not his brain, and breaks his fast with meat.
The Turk [Muslim] prays daily, fasts once a year, and crows "God!, God!" like a cock.
What heaven is reserved for people who kill chickens in the dark?
Instead of kindness and compassion, they've cast out all desire.
One kills with a chop, one lets the blood drop, in both houses burns the same fire.
Turks and Hindus have one way, the guru's made it clear.
Don't say Ram, don't say Khuda [Allah], so says Kabir.
</poem>
|Kabir, Śabda 10|Translated by Linda Hess and Shukdeo Singh{{sfn|Hess|Singh|2002|p=46}} }}

In ''Bijak'', Kabir mocks the practice of praying to avatars such as Buddha of Buddhism, by asserting "don't call the master Buddha, he didn't put down devils".{{sfn|Hess|Singh|2002|p=45}}<ref>{{cite book | last=Doniger | first=Wendy | title=The Hindus: an alternative history | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2010 | isbn=978-0-19-959334-7 | oclc=698575971 | page=484}}</ref> Kabir urged people to look within and consider all human beings as manifestation of God's living forms:

{{Quote
|<poem>
If God be within the mosque, then to whom does this world belong?
If Ram be within the image which you find upon your pilgrimage,
then who is there to know what happens without?
Hari is in the East, Allah is in the West.
Look within your heart, for there you will find both Karim and Ram;
All the men and women of the world are His living forms.
Kabir is the child of Allah and of Ram: He is my Guru, He is my Pir.
</poem>
|Kabir, III.2|Translated by [[Rabindranath Tagore]]{{sfn|Tagore|Underhill|1915|p=[https://archive.org/stream/onehundredpoemso00kabiuoft#page/72/mode/2up 72]|loc=LXIX}} }}

Charlotte Vaudeville states that the philosophy of Kabir and other [[Sant (religion)|sants]] of the Bhakti movement is the seeking of the Absolute. The notion of this Absolute is ''nirguna'' which, writes Vaudeville, is same as "the [[Upanishad]]ic concept of the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Brahman-Atman]] and the monistic [[Advaita]] interpretation of the Vedantic tradition, which denies any distinction between the soul [within a human being] and God, and urges man to recognize within himself his true divine nature".{{sfn|Schomer|McLeod|1987|pp=26}} Vaudeville notes that this philosophy of Kabir and other Bhakti sants is self-contradictory, because if God is within, then that would be a call to abolish all external [[bhakti]]. This inconsistency in Kabir's teaching may have been differentiating "union with God" from the concept of "merging into God, or Oneness in all beings". Alternatively, states Vaudeville, the ''saguna'' prema-bhakti (tender devotion) may have been prepositioned as the journey towards self-realization of the ''nirguna'' Brahman, a universality beyond monotheism.{{sfn|Schomer|McLeod|1987|pp=27-33|ps= with footnotes}}

[[David Lorenzen|David N. Lorenzen]] and Adrián Muñoz trace these ideas of God in Kabir's philosophy as ''nirguna Brahman'' to those in [[Adi Shankara]]'s theories on [[Advaita Vedanta]] school of Hinduism, albeit with some differences.{{sfn | Lorenzen | Muñoz | 2012 | p=48}}

===Influence of Islam===
Lorenzen in his review of Kabir's philosophy and poetry writes, "the extent to which Kabir borrowed elements from Islam is controversial. Many recent scholars have argued that he simply rejected Islam and took almost all his ideas and beliefs from the Hindu tradition. Contemporary Kabir Panth sadhus make roughly the same argument. Most of the vocabulary used in his songs and verses are borrowed directly from the Hindu tradition. 
Some scholars state that the sexual imagery in some of Kabir's poems reflect a mystic Sufi Islam influence, wherein Kabir inverts the traditional Sufi representation of a God-woman and devotee-man longing for a union, and instead uses the imagery of Lord-husband and devotee-bride.{{sfn|Schomer|McLeod|1987|pp=177–178|ps= with footnote 26}} Other scholars, in contrast, state that it is unclear if Sufi ideas influenced Bhakti sants like Kabir or it was vice versa, suggesting that they probably co-developed through mutual interaction.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wIOSb97ph3EC&pg=PA116|title=India's Agony Over Religion|last=Larson|first=Gerald James|date=1995|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=0791424111|pages=116|oclc=30544951}}</ref>

Kabir left Islam, states Ronald McGregor.<ref name=ronaldsikh/> Kabir, nevertheless, criticized practices such as killing and eating a cow by Muslims, in a manner Hindus criticized those practices:

{{Quote
|<poem>
We have searched the ''turaki Dharam'' ([[Delhi Sultanate|Turk's religion]], Islam), these teachers throw many thunderbolts,
Recklessly they display boundless pride while explaining their own aims, they kill cows.
How can they kill the mother, whose milk they drink like that of a wet nurse?
The young and the old drink milk pudding, but these fools eat the cow's body.
These morons know nothing, they wander about in ignorance,
Without looking into one's heart, how can one reach paradise?
</poem>
|Kabir, Ramaini 1|Translated by [[David Lorenzen]]{{sfn | Lorenzen | Muñoz | 2012 | p=27}} }}

===Persecution and social impact===
Kabir's couplets suggest he was persecuted for his views, while he was alive. He stated, for example,

{{Quote
|<poem>
Saints I see the world is mad.
If I tell the truth they rush to beat me,
if I lie they trust me.
</poem>
|Kabir, Shabad - 4|{{sfn|Hess|Singh|2002|p=4}} }}

Kabir response to persecution and slander was to welcome it. He called the slanderer a friend, expressed gratefulness for the slander, for it brought him closer to his god.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/006269083|title=Mystic songs of Kabir|last=Das|first=G.

The legends about Kabir describe him as the underdog who nevertheless is victorious in trials by a Sultan, a Brahmin, a [[Qazi]], a merchant, a god or a goddess. The ideological messages in the legends appealed to the poor and oppressed. According to David Lorenzen, legends about Kabir reflect a "protest against social discrimination and economic exploitation", they present the perspective of the poor and powerless, not the rich and powerful.{{sfn|Lorenzen|1991|pp=5-6}} However, many scholars doubt that these legends of persecution are authentic, point to the lack of any corroborating evidence, consider it unlikely that a Muslim Sultan would take orders from Hindu Brahmins or Kabir's own mother demanded that the Sultan punish Kabir, and question the historicity of the legends on Kabir.{{sfn|Lorenzen|1991|pp=16-35}}

==Legacy==
Kabir literature legacy was championed by two of his disciples, Bhāgodās and Dharmadās. [[Songs of Kabir]] were collected by [[Kshitimohan Sen]] from mendicants across India, these were then translated to English by [[Rabindranath Tagore]].<ref>{{cite book | title = Songs of Kabir in Persian : Gutenberg: Songs of Kabir by Rabindranath Tagore| url = https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6519}}</ref>

New English translations of Songs of Kabir is done by [[Arvind Krishna Mehrotra]]. August Kleinzahler writes about this: "It is Mehrotra who has succeeded in capturing the ferocity and improvisational energy of Kabir’s poetry".<ref>{{cite news|title=Rebirth of a Poet|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/29/books/review/book-review-songs-of-kabir-by-translated-by-arvind-krishna-mehrotra.html|work=The New York Times|date=27 May 2011|access-date=19 October 2015|last1=Kleinzahler|first1=August}}</ref>

Kabir's legacy continues to be carried forward by the [[Kabir panth]] ("Path of Kabir"), a religious community that recognises him as its founder and is one of the [[Sant Mat]] sects. This community was founded centuries after Kabir died, in various parts of India, over the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.<ref name="Archive">{{Cite journal|last=Grewal|first=J S|date=2010|title=WH McLeod and Sikh Studies|url=http://punjab.global.ucsb.edu/sites/secure.lsit.ucsb.edu.gisp.d7_sp/files/sitefiles/journals/volume17/JPS_17_nos_1-2_Grewal.pdf|journal=Journal of Punjab Studies|volume=17|pages=119}}</ref> Its members, known as ''Kabir panthis'', are estimated to be around 9.6 million.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Friedlander|first=Peter|date=2010-07-05|title=Ritual and reform in the Kabir Panth|url=https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/30271|journal=Crises and Opportunities: Past, Present and Future.

There are two temples dedicated to Kabir located in [[Benares]]. One of them is maintained by [[Hindus]], while the other by Muslims. Both the temples practise similar forms of worship where his songs are sung daily. Other rituals of [[aarti]] and distributing prasad are similar to other [[Hindu temple]]s. The followers of Kabir are vegetarians and abstain from alcohol.{{sfn|Sastri|2002|p=33}}

Kabir's verses were incorporated into [[Adi Granth]], the scripture of [[Sikhism]], with verses attributed to Kabir constituting the largest non-Sikh contribution.<ref name=ronaldsikh>Ronald McGregor (1984), Hindi literature from its beginnings to the nineteenth century, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3447024136}}, page 47</ref>

Harpreet Singh, quoting Hew McLeod, states, "In its earliest stage Sikhism was clearly a movement within the Hindu tradition; Nanak was raised a Hindu and eventually belonged to the [[Sant (religion)|Sant]] tradition of northern India, a movement associated with the great poet and mystic Kabir."<ref>Pashaura Singh and Louis E. Fenech (2014), The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199699308}}, page 205</ref> Surjit Singh Gandhi disagrees, and writes "Guru Nanak in his thought pattern as well as in action model was fundamentally different from Kabir and for that matter other radical Bhaktas or saints (saint has been erroneously used for such Bhaktas by Mcleod). Hence to consider Kabir as an influence on Guru Nanak is wrong, both historically and theologically".<ref name="Gandhi" />

McLeod places Nanak in the Sant tradition that included Kabir and states that their fundamental doctrines were reproduced by Nanak. JS Grewal contests this view and states that McLeod's approach is limiting in its scope because, "McLeod takes into account only concepts, ignores practices altogether, he concentrates on similarities and ignores all differences".<ref>J. S. Grewal (2010), [http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal/v17_1-2/articles/JPS_17_nos_1-2_Grewal.pdf WH McLeod and Sikh Studies, Journal of Punjab Studies, Volume 17, Issue 1–2, page 119]</ref>

==Kabir's poetry today==
There are several allusions to Kabir's poetry in mainstream Indian film music. The title song of the [[Sufi]] fusion band [[Indian Ocean (band)|Indian Ocean]]'s album [[Jhini]] is an energetic rendering of Kabir's famous poem "The intricately woven blanket", with influences from [[Indian folk music|Indian folk]], Sufi traditions and progressive rock.

Neeraj Arya's Kabir Cafe marries Kabir's couplets with contemporary music adding elements of rock, carnatic, and folk. Popular renderings include Halke Gaadi Haanko, Chadariya Jhini and Chor Awega. Kabir Cafe claims that living their lives just as Kabir suggests has led to them experiencing some of these truths and it reflects in their performances.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://m.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/our-band-s-first-member-is-kabir-neeraj-arya-s-kabir-cafe/story-MSBwRyh0z9kAPtk1bMvEOL.html|title = Our band's first member is Kabir: Neeraj Arya's Kabir Café|date = 17 April 2017}}</ref>

Noted classical singer, late [[Kumar Gandharva]], is widely recognized for his wonderful rendering of Kabir's poetry.

Documentary filmmaker [[Shabnam Virmani]], from the [[Kabir Project]], has produced a series of documentaries and books tracing Kabir's philosophy, music and poetry in present-day India and Pakistan. The documentaries feature Indian folk singers such as Prahlad Tipanya, [[Mukhtiyar Ali]] and the Pakistani [[Qawwali|Qawwal]] [[Fareed Ayaz]]. Kabir festival was organized in [[Mumbai]], India in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.festivalsofindia.in/Kabir_Festival/|title=Kabir Festival 2017 |website=Festivals of India}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sahapedia.org/kabir-festival-mumbai-2017 |title=Kabir Festival Mumbai 2017 |website=Sahapedia.org}}</ref>

The album No Stranger Here by [[Shubha Mudgal]], [[Ursula Rucker]] draws heavily from Kabir's poetry. Kabir's poetry has appeared prominently in filmmaker [[Anand Gandhi]]'s films [[Right Here, Right Now (Anand Gandhi film)|Right Here Right Now]] (2003) and Continuum. Pakistani Sufi singer [[Abida Parveen]] has sung Kabir in a full album.

==Criticism==
Kabir has been criticised for his depiction of women. Nikky-Guninder Kaur Singh states, "Kabir's opinion of women is contemptuous and derogatory".<ref name="Nikki"/> [[Wendy Doniger]] concludes Kabir had a [[Misogyny|misogynist]] bias.<ref name="Nikki"/> Schomer states that for Kabir, woman is "kali nagini (a black cobra), kunda naraka ka (the pit of hell), juthani jagata ki (the refuse of the world)". According to Kabir, a woman prevents man's spiritual progress.<ref name="Nikki">{{cite book | title=The Feminine Principle in the Sikh Vision of the Transcendent | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Nikky-Guninder Kaur Singh | date=24 September 1993 | location=English | pages=114–116 | isbn=978-0521432870}}</ref>

Woman ruins everything when she comes near man;

In contrast to Singh's interpretation of Kabir's gender views, Dass interprets ''Rag Asa'' section of Adi Granth as Kabir asking a young married woman to stop veiling her face, and not to adopt such social habits.<ref>Nirmal Dass (1991), Songs of Kabir from the Adi Granth, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791405611}}, pages 147-148</ref> Dass adds that Kabir's poetry can be interpreted in two ways, one literally where the woman refers to human female, another allegorically where woman is symbolism for his own soul and ''Rama'' is the Lord-husband.<ref>Nirmal Dass (1991), Songs of Kabir from the Adi Granth, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791405611}}, pages 322-323</ref>
