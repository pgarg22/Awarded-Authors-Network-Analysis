His best-known works include the novel ''[[Tarry Flynn]]'', and the poems "[[On Raglan Road]]" and "The Great Hunger".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcd.ie/English/patrickkavanagh/ |title=The Patrick Kavanagh, 1904–1967 |publisher=Tcd.ie |access-date=12 November 2009 |archive-date=23 May 2013 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6GppAPda1?url=http://www.tcd.ie/English/patrickkavanagh/ |url-status=live }}</ref> He is known for his accounts of Irish life through reference to the everyday and commonplace.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.rte.ie/laweb/ll/ll_t03_main.html |title=RTÉ Libraries and Archives: preserving a unique record of Irish life |publisher=Rte.ie |access-date=12 November 2009 |archive-date=23 May 2013 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6GppB5oXp?url=http://www.rte.ie/archives/ |url-status=live }}</ref> He also played as a [[Goalkeeper (Gaelic games)|goalkeeper]] for his local [[Gaelic football]] club.

==Life and work==

===Early life===
Patrick Kavanagh was born in rural [[Inniskeen]], [[County Monaghan]], in 1904, the fourth of ten children of James Kavanagh and Bridget Quinn.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/pages/1911/Monaghan/Kiltybegs/Mucker/799100/ |title=National Archives |publisher=Census.nationalarchives.ie |date=27 August 2009 |access-date=12 November 2009 |archive-date=11 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190911223814/http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/pages/1911/Monaghan/Kiltybegs/Mucker/799100/ |url-status=live }}</ref> His grandfather was a schoolteacher called "Kevany",<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1995/0327/Pg002.html#Ar00201 | work=The Irish Times|title=Monoghan Nun Finds Kavanagh's Lost Past|first=Michael|last=Finlan|date=27 March 1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicireland.net/the-mystical-imagination-of-patrick-kavanagh/|title=The Mystical Imagination of Patrick Kavanagh|date=1999|work=Spirituality|publisher=Catholicireland.net|access-date=6 July 2013|archive-date=29 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200225/http://www.catholicireland.net/the-mystical-imagination-of-patrick-kavanagh/|url-status=live}}</ref> which a local priest changed to "[[Kavanagh (surname)|Kavanagh]]" at his baptism. The grandfather had to leave the area following a scandal and never taught in a national school again, but married and raised a family in [[Tullamore]]. Patrick Kavanagh's father, James, was a cobbler and farmer. Kavanagh's brother [[Peter Kavanagh (writer)|Peter]] became a university professor and writer, two of their sisters were teachers, three became nurses, and one became a nun.

Patrick Kavanagh was a pupil at Kednaminsha National School from 1909 to 1916, leaving in sixth class at the age of 13.<ref Name="PKT">[http://www.tcd.ie/English/patrickkavanagh/life.html Profile] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090607162100/http://www.tcd.ie/English/patrickkavanagh/life.html |date=7 June 2009 }} from the Patrick Kavanagh Trust</ref> He became apprenticed to his father as a shoemaker and worked on his farm.

===Writing career===
[[File:George William Russell - Project Gutenberg eText 19028.jpg|thumb|right|[[George William Russell]], Kavanagh's literary advisor and mentor]]
Kavanagh's first published work appeared in 1928<ref Name="Archive"/> in the ''[[Dundalk Democrat]]'' and the ''[[Irish Independent]]''. Kavanagh had encountered a copy of the ''Irish Statesman'', edited by [[George William Russell]], who published under the pen name AE and was a leader of the [[Irish Literary Revival]]. Russell at first rejected Kavanagh's work but encouraged him to keep submitting, and he went on to publish verse by Kavanagh in 1929 and 1930.<ref Name="Foundation"/> This inspired the farmer to leave home and attempt to further his aspirations. In 1931, he walked 80 miles (abt. 129 kilometres) to meet Russell in [[Dublin]], where Kavanagh's brother was a teacher.<ref Name="Archive"/><ref Name="Foundation"/> Russell gave Kavanagh books, among them works by [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Victor Hugo]], [[Walt Whitman]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[Robert Browning]], and became Kavanagh's literary adviser.<ref Name="Foundation"/> Kavanagh joined Dundalk Library and the first book he borrowed was ''[[The Waste Land]]'' by [[T. S. Eliot]].

Kavanagh's first collection, ''Ploughman and Other Poems'', was published in 1936. It is notable for its realistic portrayal of Irish country life, free of the romantic sentiment often seen at the time in rural poems, a trait he abhorred.<ref Name="Archive"/> Published by [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] in its series on new poets,<ref Name="Foundation"/> the book expressed a commitment to colloquial speech and the unvarnished lives of real people, which made him unpopular with the literary establishment.<ref Name="Archive"/> Two years after his first collection was published he had yet to make a significant impression. The ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'' described him as "a young Irish poet of promise rather than of achievement," and ''[[The Spectator]]'' commented that, "like other poets admired by A.E., he writes much better prose than poetry. Mr Kavanagh's lyrics are for the most part slight and conventional, easily enjoyed but almost as easily forgotten."<ref Name="Foundation"/>

In 1938 Kavanagh went to London. He remained there for about five months. ''The Green Fool'', a loosely autobiographical novel, was published in 1938 and Kavanagh was accused of libel.<ref Name="PKT"/> [[Oliver St. John Gogarty]] sued Kavanagh for his description of his first visit to Gogarty's home: "I mistook Gogarty's white-robed maid for his wife or his mistress; I expected every poet to have a spare wife."  Gogarty, who had taken offence at the close coupling of the words "wife" and "mistress", was awarded £100 in damages.<ref>{{cite book |title= Patrick Kavanagh |url= https://archive.org/details/patrickkavanagh00obri |url-access= registration |last= O'Brien |first= Darcy |year= 1975 |publisher= Bucknell University Press |location= Lewisburg |page= [https://archive.org/details/patrickkavanagh00obri/page/29 29]}}</ref> The book, which recounted Kavanagh's rural childhood and his attempts to become a writer, received international recognition and good reviews.<ref Name="Foundation"/> However, it was also claimed to be somewhat 'anti-Catholic' in tone, to which Kavanagh reacted by demanding that the work be prominently displayed in Dublin book shop windows.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2018/1224/1018959-patrick-kavanagh-the-green-fool/ |title=1938 file reveals Kavanagh demanded book in shop windows |publisher=RTE |date=28 December 2018 |access-date=28 December 2018 |archive-date=28 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181228031421/https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2018/1224/1018959-patrick-kavanagh-the-green-fool/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== The Emergency ===

 |quote  =<poem>
On Raglan Road on an autumn day I met her first and knew
That her dark hair would weave a snare that I might one day rue;
I saw the danger, yet I walked along the enchanted way,
And I said, let grief be a fallen leaf at the dawning of the day.

On Grafton Street in November we tripped lightly along the ledge
Of the deep ravine where can be seen the worth of passion's pledge,
The Queen of Hearts still making tarts and I not making hay –
O I loved too much and by such and such is happiness thrown away.

The outbreak of [[World War II]] (known as [[The Emergency (Ireland)|The Emergency]] in [[Republic of Ireland|the Republic of Ireland]]) had a damaging effect on the emerging careers of some Irish writers, including [[Flann O'Brien]] as well as Kavanagh <ref name="quinn" /> as they lost access to their publishers in London and reprints of their books could not be arranged. The Republic, which was neutral during the war, shared a border with [[Northern Ireland]] (which, as part of the [[United Kingdom]] was involved on the [[Allies of World War II|Allied side]]). There were smuggling opportunities on the border, especially in [[County Monaghan|Monaghan]], which would have been more lucrative than writing a this time. <ref name="quinn" />

In 1939 Kavanagh settled in Dublin. In his biography John Nemo describes Kavanagh's encounter with the city's literary world: "he realized that the stimulating environment he had imagined was little different from the petty and ignorant world he had left. He soon saw through the literary masks many Dublin writers wore to affect an air of artistic sophistication. To him such men were dandies, journalists, and civil servants playing at art. His disgust was deepened by the fact that he was treated as the literate peasant he had been rather than as the highly talented poet he believed he was in the process of becoming".<ref name="Foundation" /><ref>Nemo, John, ''Patrick Kavanagh'', Twayne, 1979.</ref> 


During this time he met [[John Betjeman]] who was based in Dublin during the Emergency nominally as a press attaché but also working for [[British intelligence agencies|British intelligence]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Burke|first=Ray|title=The poet as press attaché – An Irishman’s Diary on John Betjeman in Ireland|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/the-poet-as-press-attach%C3%A9-an-irishman-s-diary-on-john-betjeman-in-ireland-1.4290764|access-date=2021-03-19|website=The Irish Times|language=en|archive-date=8 February 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210208164324/https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/the-poet-as-press-attach%C3%A9-an-irishman-s-diary-on-john-betjeman-in-ireland-1.4290764|url-status=live}}</ref> Betjeman, impressed by Kavanagh's wide range of social contacts in, his ability to get invited to events, and his political ambiguity, tried to recruit him as a British spy.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Turning libel into crucifixion|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/turning-libel-into-crucifixion-1.633890|access-date=2021-03-19|website=The Irish Times|language=en|archive-date=5 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305145432/http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/turning-libel-into-crucifixion-1.633890|url-status=live}}</ref>


In 1942 he published his long poem ''The Great Hunger'', which describes the privations and hardship of the rural life he knew well. Although it was rumoured at the time that all copies of ''[[Horizon (magazine)|Horizon]]'', the literary magazine in which it was published, were seized by the [[Garda Síochána]], Kavanagh denied that this had occurred, saying later that he was visited by two Gardaí at his home (probably in connection with an investigation of ''Horizon'' under the Special Powers Act).<ref name="quinn">{{cite book | title=Patrick Kavanagh: A Biography | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=afb4AwAAQBAJ | publisher=Gill and Macmillan | author=Quinn, Antoinette | year=2003 | location=Dublin | pages=Chapter 10 - The Great Hunger | isbn=9780717163748 | access-date=7 November 2016 | archive-date=18 August 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200818215412/https://books.google.com/books?id=afb4AwAAQBAJ | url-status=live }}</ref> Written from the viewpoint of a single peasant against the historical background of famine and emotional despair, the poem is often held by critics to be Kavanagh's finest work. It set out to counter the saccharine romanticising of the Irish literary establishment in its view of peasant life. [[Richard Murphy (poet)|Richard Murphy]] in ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' described it as "a great work" and [[Robin Skelton]] in ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'' praised it as "a vision of mythic intensity".<ref name="Foundation" />

=== Post-War ===
Kavanagh worked as a part-time journalist, writing a gossip column in the ''[[Irish Press]]'' under the pseudonym Piers Plowman from 1942 to 1944 and acted as film critic for the same publication from 1945 to 1949. In 1946 the Archbishop of Dublin, [[John Charles McQuaid#The Archbishop and the Poet|John Charles McQuaid]], found Kavanagh a job on the Catholic magazine ''[[Catholic Standard (Ireland)|The Standard]]''. McQuaid continued to support him throughout his life.<ref>{{cite book |title= Preventing the Future |last= Garvin |first= Tom |year= 2004 |publisher= Gill & Macmillan |location= Dublin |page= 72}}</ref> ''Tarry Flynn'', a semi-autobiographical novel, was published in 1948 and was banned for a time.<ref Name="Archive"/> It is a fictional account of rural life. It was later made into a play, performed at the [[Abbey Theatre]] in 1966.

In late 1946 Kavanagh moved to [[Belfast]], where he worked as a journalist and as a barman in a number of public houses in the [[Falls Road, Belfast|Falls Road]] area. During this period he lodged in the Beechmount area in a house where he was related to the tenant through the tenant's brother-in-law in Ballymackney, [[County Monaghan]]. Before returning to [[Dublin]] in November 1949 he presented numerous manuscripts to the family, all of which are now believed to be in Spain.

Kavanagh's personality became progressively quixotic as his drinking increased over the years and his health deteriorated. Eventually becoming a dishevelled figure, he moved among the bars of Dublin, drinking whiskey and displaying his predilection for turning on benefactors and friends.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2001/11/18/story828778828.asp |title=Patrick Kavanagh – A Biography by Antoinette Quinn: ThePost.ie |publisher=Archives.tcm.ie |date=18 November 2001 |access-date=12 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050127040005/http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2001/11/18/story828778828.asp |archive-date=27 January 2005 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Later career===
[[File:Patrick.Kavanagh.JPG|thumb|250px|''Patrick Kavanagh'' by [[Patrick Swift]], lithograph, 1956, [[National Portrait Gallery, London|NPG, London]]]]
In 1949 Kavanagh began to write a monthly "Diary" for ''[[Envoy, A Review of Literature and Art|Envoy]]'', a literary publication founded by [[John Ryan (Dublin artist)|John Ryan]], who became a lifelong friend and benefactor. ''Envoy''{{'}}s offices were at 39 Grafton Street, but most of the journal's business was conducted in a nearby pub, McDaid's, which Kavanagh subsequently adopted as his local. Through ''Envoy'' he came into contact with a circle of young artists and intellectuals including [[Anthony Cronin]], [[Patrick Swift]], [[John Jordan (poet)|John Jordan]] and the sculptor [[Desmond MacNamara]], whose bust of Kavanagh is in the Irish National Writers Museum. Kavanagh often referred to these times as the period of his "poetic rebirth".<ref>Antoinette Quinn, ''Patrick Kavanagh: A Biography'', Gill & Macmillan, 2001, pp. 291296.</ref>

In 1952 Kavanagh published his own journal, ''Kavanagh’s Weekly: A Journal of Literature and Politics'', in conjunction with, and financed by, his brother [[Peter Kavanagh (writer)|Peter]]. It ran to some 13 issues, from 12 April to 5 July 1952.<ref Name="PKT"/>

[[Image:Kavanagh grave2.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Kavanagh's grave, Inniskeen]]

===''The Leader'' lawsuit and lung cancer===
In 1954 two major events changed Kavanagh's life. First, he issued libel proceedings against a magazine called ''The Leader'' for publishing an anonymously-written profile of him as an alcoholic sponger. <ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Who framed Patrick Kavanagh?|url=https://www.lawsociety.ie/gazette/top-stories/patrick-kavanagh/|access-date=2021-03-19|website=www.lawsociety.ie|archive-date=11 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201111222415/https://www.lawsociety.ie/gazette/top-stories/patrick-kavanagh/|url-status=live}}</ref> Kavanagh had made numerous enemies in his film and literary criticism and had written diatribes against the [[Civil Service of the Republic of Ireland|Civil Service]], the [[Arts Council (Ireland)|Arts Council]], the [[Irish Language movement]] so there were many possible authors of the piece. <ref name=":0" /> Based on his previous experience of libel, he believed he would get an out-of-court settlement. However, the magazine hired former (and future) [[Taoiseach]] and [[Attorney General of Ireland|Attorney General]] (1926–1932) [[John A. Costello]] as their barrister, who won the case when it came to trial.<ref Name="PKT"/> 


Second, shortly after Kavanagh lost this case, he was diagnosed with lung cancer and was admitted to hospital, where he had a lung removed.<ref name="Archive" /> It was while recovering from this [[Surgery|operation]] by relaxing on the banks of the [[Grand Canal (Ireland)|Grand Canal]] in Dublin that Kavanagh rediscovered his poetic vision. He began to appreciate nature and his surroundings, and took his inspiration from them for many of his later poems.<ref name="Archive" />


Costello and Kavanagh eventually became good friends,<ref name="Foundation" /> with Kavanagh remarking that he voted for him after the trial. 

===Turning point: Kavanagh begins to receive acclaim===
In 1955 Macmillan rejected a typescript of poems by Kavanagh, which left the poet very depressed.<ref>Quinn, ''Patrick Kavanagh: A Biography'' (2001): "Macmillan's rejection had left him very downcast. ... Patrick Swift was invited to peruse the contents and decided that the poems should be published."</ref> Patrick Swift, on a visit to Dublin in 1956, was invited by Kavanagh to look at the typescript. Swift then arranged for the poems to be published in the English literary journal ''[[Nimbus (literary magazine)|Nimbus]]''<ref>''Nimbus'', Vol. III, No. IV (Winter 1956). 19 poems were published, with an introduction to Kavanagh by Anthony Cronin.</ref>(19 poems were published). This proved a turning point and Kavanagh began receiving the acclaim that he had always felt he deserved. His next collection, ''Come Dance with Kitty Stobling'', was directly linked to the mini-collection in ''Nimbus''.<ref>Quinn, ''Patrick Kavanagh: A Biography'', 2001, p. 359: "Publication there [in ''Nimbus''] was to prove a turning point… The publication of his next volume of verse, Come Dance with Kitty Stobling, was to be directly linked to the mini-collection in Nimbus, and his Collected Poems (1964)".</ref>

Between 1959 and 1962 Kavanagh spent more time in London, where he contributed to Swift's [[X (magazine)|''X'']] magazine.<ref>Two Poems ("Living in the Country", "Lecture Hall"), ''X'', Vol. I, No. I (November 1959); "Poets on Poetry: I, Patrick Kavanagh", ''X'', Vol. I, No. II (March 1960); "The Flying Moment", ''X'', Vol. I, No. III (June 1960); "Art and Morality: On a Liberal Education", ''X'', Vol. II, No. II (August 1961); "The Cattle Fair; Mermaid Tavern", ''X'',  Vol. II, No. III (July 1962). Also in ''An Anthology from X'' (OUP, 1988)</ref> During this period Kavanagh occasionally stayed with the Swifts in Westbourne Terrace.<ref>Martin Green (''Patrick Swift 1927–83'', Gandon Editions, 1993): "... but it was in that basement flat that Patrick Kavanagh sheltered on and off for a while. And it is the mention of Kavanagh that brings back to me that infectious gaiety and generosity that is at the heart of my memory of Paddy Swift.... It was he, together with Tony Cronin, who initially put up the idea of bringing together Kavanagh's poems for the Collected Poems."</ref> He gave lectures at [[University College Dublin]] and in the United States,<ref Name="Archive"/> represented Ireland at literary symposiums, and became a judge of the Guinness Poetry Awards.

In London he often stayed with his publisher, [[Martin Green (author)|Martin Green]], and Green's wife Fiona, in their house in Tottenham Street, [[Fitzrovia]]. It was at this time that Martin Green produced Kavanagh's ''Collected Poems'' (1964) with prompting from [[Patrick Swift]] and [[Anthony Cronin]]".<ref>Martin Green, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jan/08/featuresreviews.guardianreview8 letter] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826144819/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jan/08/featuresreviews.guardianreview8 |date=26 August 2016 }} to ''The Guardian'', 8 January 2005.</ref> In the introduction Kavanagh wrote: "A man innocently dabbles in words and rhymes, and finds that it is his life."

===Marriage and death===
[[File:Poet Patrick Kavanagh.jpg|thumbnail|left|The poet "pondering the Stony Grey Soil of Monaghan at his native Inniskeen" in 1963]]
Kavanagh married his long-term companion Katherine Barry Moloney (niece of [[Kevin Barry]]) in April 1967 and they set up home together on the Waterloo Road in Dublin.<ref Name="PKT"/><ref Name="Archive"/> Kavanagh fell ill at the first performance of ''Tarry Flynn'' by the [[Abbey Theatre]] company in [[Dundalk]] Town Hall and died a few days later, on 30 November 1967, in a Dublin, in Merrion Nursing Home.<ref Name="Archive"/> His grave is in [[Inniskeen]] adjoining the [[Patrick Kavanagh Centre]]. His wife Katherine died in 1989; she is also buried there.

==Legacy==
Nobel Laureate [[Séamus Heaney]] is acknowledged to have been influenced by Kavanagh.<ref>Philip Cummins, [http://www.irishpost.co.uk/news/obituary-seamus-henaey-1939-2013 "Obituary: Seamus Heaney (1939 – 2013)"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228185725/http://www.irishpost.co.uk/news/obituary-seamus-henaey-1939-2013 |date=28 December 2014 }}, ''The Irish Post'', 30 August 2013.</ref> Heaney was introduced to Kavanagh's work by the writer [[Michael McLaverty]] when they taught together at St Thomas's, [[Belfast]]. Heaney and Kavanagh shared a belief in the capacity of the local, or parochial, to reveal the universal. Heaney once said that Kavanagh's poetry "had a transformative effect on the general culture and liberated the gifts of the poetic generations who came after him." Heaney noted: "Kavanagh is a truly representative modern figure in that his subversiveness was turned upon himself: dissatisfaction, both spiritual and artistic, is what inspired his growth.... His instruction and example helped us to see an essential difference between what he called the parochial and provincial mentalities". As Kavanagh put it: "All great civilizations are based on the parish". He concludes that Kavanagh's poetry vindicates his "indomitable faith in himself and in the art that made him so much more than himself".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jan/01/poetry |title=Review: Collected Poems by Patrick Kavanagh |newspaper=The Guardian |date=1 January 2005 |access-date=12 November 2009 |location=London |first=Seamus |last=Heaney |archive-date=30 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030175421/http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jan/01/poetry |url-status=live }}</ref>

The actor [[Russell Crowe]] has stated that he is a fan of Kavanagh. He commented: "I like the clarity and the emotiveness of Kavanagh. I like how he combines the kind of mystic into really clear, evocative work that can make you glad you are alive". On 24 February 2002, after winning the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role]] for his performance in ''[[A Beautiful Mind (film)|A Beautiful Mind]]'', Crowe quoted Kavanagh during his acceptance speech at the [[55th British Academy Film Awards]]. When he became aware that the Kavanagh quote had been cut from the final broadcast, Crowe became aggressive with the [[BBC]] producer responsible, Malcolm Gerrie.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1856202.stm |title=The poet behind Russell Crowe's rage |work=BBC News |date=5 March 2002 |access-date=12 November 2009 |archive-date=6 July 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060706162236/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1856202.stm |url-status=live }}</ref> He said: "it was about a one minute fifty speech but they've cut a minute out of it".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/feb/28/baftas2002film.baftasfilm |title=Crowe 'clarifies' BAFTA outburst |newspaper=The Guardian |date=28 February 2002 |access-date=12 November 2009 |location=London |archive-date=30 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030015359/http://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/feb/28/baftas2002film.baftasfilm |url-status=live }}</ref> The poem that was cut was a four-line poem:
<poem>
To be a poet and not know the trade,
To be a lover and repel all women;
Twin ironies by which great saints are made,
The agonising pincer-jaws of heaven.
</poem>

When the ''[[Irish Times]]'' compiled a list of favourite Irish poems in 2000, ten of Kavanagh's poems were in the top 50, and he was rated the second favourite poet behind [[W. B. Yeats]]. Kavanagh's poem "[[On Raglan Road]]", set to the traditional air "Fáinne Geal an Lae", composed by [[Thomas Connellan]] in the 17th century, has been performed by numerous artists as diverse as [[Van Morrison]], [[Luke Kelly]], [[Dire Straits]], [[Billy Bragg]], [[Sinéad O'Connor]], [[Joan Osborne]] and many others.

There is a statue of Kavanagh beside Dublin's [[Grand Canal (Ireland)|Grand Canal]], inspired by his poem "Lines written on a Seat on the Grand Canal, Dublin":
<poem>
O commemorate me where there is water
canal water preferably, so stilly
greeny at the heart of summer. Brother
commemorate me thus beautifully.
</poem>
Every 17 March, after the St Patrick's day parade, a group of Kavanagh's friends gather at the Kavanagh seat on the banks of the [[Grand Canal (Ireland)|Grand Canal]] at Mespil road in his honour. The seat was erected by his friends, led by [[John Ryan (Dublin artist)|John Ryan]] and Denis Dwyer, in 1968.<ref>[http://kavanaghseat.com/remembering-how-we-stood.html Remembering how we stood, John Ryan, (Lilliput Press 1987 pp123 – 126)]</ref> A bronze sculpture of the writer stands outside the Palace Bar on Dublin's Fleet Street.<ref>Nihill, Cian.

His poetic tribute to his friend the Irish American sculptor [[Jerome Connor]] was used in the plaque overlooking Dublin's [[Phoenix Park]] dedicated to Connor.

The [[Patrick Kavanagh Poetry Award]] is presented each year for an unpublished collection of poems. The annual Patrick Kavanagh Weekend takes place on the last weekend in September in [[Inniskeen]], [[County Monaghan]], Ireland. The [[Patrick Kavanagh Centre]], an interpretative centre set up to commemorate the poet, is located in Inniskeen.

 |quote  =<poem>
Me I will throw away.
Me sufficient for the day
The sticky self that clings
Adhesions on the wings.
To love and adventure
To go on the grand tour
A man must be free
From self-necessity.
See over there
A created splendour
Made by one individual
From things residual
With all the various
Qualities hilarious
Of what
Hitherto was not

In 1986, Peter Kavanagh negotiated the sale of Patrick Kavanagh's papers as well as a large collection of his own work devoted to the late poet to [[University College Dublin]]. The purchase was enabled by a public appeal for funds by the late Professor Gus Martin. Peter included in the sale his original hand press which he had built.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web |author=Audio Visual Centre, UCD |url=https://www.ucd.ie/specialcollections/archives/kavanagh/ |title=The Kavanagh Archive |publisher=Ucd.ie |access-date=12 November 2009 |archive-date=13 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161213085318/http://www.ucd.ie/specialcollections/archives/kavanagh/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The archive is housed in a special collections room in UCD's library, and the hand press is on loan to the Patrick Kavanagh Centre, [[Inniskeen]].

===Copyright===
Ownership of the copyright is vested in Trustees of The Patrick and Katherine Kavanagh Trust by virtue of the terms of the will of the late Kathleen Kavanagh, widow of the poet, who in turn became entitled to the copyright on the death of her husband. The proceeds of the trust are used to support deserving writers. The Trustees are [[Leland Bardwell]], Patrick MacEntee, [[Eiléan Ní Chuilleanáin]], [[Eunan O'Halpin]], and [[Macdara Woods]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcd.ie/English/patrickkavanagh/thetrust.html |title=The Patrick and Katherine Kavanagh Trust |publisher=Tcd.ie |access-date=12 November 2009 |archive-date=1 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001181241/http://www.tcd.ie/English/patrickkavanagh/thetrust.html |url-status=live }}</ref> This was disputed by the late Peter Kavanagh who continued publishing his work after Patrick's death. This dispute led some books to go out of print. Most of his work is now available in the UK and Ireland but the status in the United States is more uncertain.
