'''Siegfried Loraine Sassoon''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|CBE|MC}} (8 September 1886&nbsp;– 1 September 1967) was an English [[war poet]], writer, and soldier. Decorated for bravery on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]],<ref>{{cite web |last=Sassoon |first=Siegfried |title=Journal, 26 June 1916 – 12 August 1916 |url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-09852-00001-00007/17

His poetry both described the horrors of the trenches and satirised the patriotic pretensions of those who, in Sassoon's view, were responsible for a [[jingoism]]-fuelled war.<ref>''Siegfried Sassoon: The Making of a War Poet'', Jean Moorcroft Wilson (Duckworth, 2004).</ref> Sassoon became a focal point for dissent within the armed forces when he made a lone protest against the continuation of the war in his "Soldier's Declaration" of 1917, culminating in his admission to a military psychiatric hospital; this resulted in his forming a friendship with [[Wilfred Owen]], who was greatly influenced by him.  Sassoon later won acclaim for his prose work, notably his three-volume fictionalised autobiography, collectively known as the "[[Sherston trilogy]]".

==Early life==
[[File:First World War 1914 - 1918- War Poets HU50506.jpg|thumbnail|left|Sassoon (front) with his brother Hamo and other students on the morning after a college [[May Ball]] at [[Cambridge University]] in 1906]]
Siegfried Sassoon was born to a Jewish father and an [[Anglo-Catholic]] mother, and grew up in the neo-gothic mansion named "Weirleigh" (after its builder, [[Harrison Weir]]), in [[Matfield]], Kent.<ref name=KSC10122010>{{Cite news|title=War poet was tasty with bat |first=Frank |last=Chapman |newspaper=Kent and Sussex Courier |date=10 December 2010 |page=42}}</ref> His father, Alfred Ezra Sassoon (1861–1895), son of [[Sassoon David Sassoon]], was a member of the wealthy [[Baghdadi Jews|Baghdadi Jewish]] [[Sassoon family|Sassoon merchant family]]. For marrying outside the faith, Alfred was disinherited. Siegfried's mother, [[Theresa Thornycroft|Theresa]], belonged to the [[Thornycroft family]], sculptors responsible for many of the best-known statues in London—her brother was Sir [[Hamo Thornycroft]]. There was no German ancestry in Sassoon's family; his mother named him Siegfried because of her love of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s operas. His middle name, Loraine, was the surname of a clergyman with whom she was friendly.

Siegfried was the second of three sons, the others being Michael and Hamo. When he was four years old his parents separated. During his father's weekly visits to the boys, Theresa locked herself in the drawing-room. In 1895 Alfred Sassoon died of [[tuberculosis]].

Sassoon was educated at the [[New Beacon School]], [[Sevenoaks]], Kent; at [[Marlborough College]], Wiltshire; and at [[Clare College, Cambridge]], where from 1905 to 1907 he read history. He went down from Cambridge without a degree and spent the next few years hunting, playing cricket and writing verse: some he published privately. Since his father had been disinherited from the Sassoon fortune for marrying a non-Jew, Siegfried had only a small private income that allowed him to live modestly without having to earn a living (however, he would later be left a generous legacy by an aunt, [[Rachel Beer]], allowing him to buy the great estate of Heytesbury House in Wiltshire.<ref>[http://siegfried-sassoon.firstworldwarrelics.co.uk/html/heytesbury.html Heytesbury House]</ref>) His first published success, ''The Daffodil Murderer'' (1913), was a parody of [[John Masefield]]'s ''[[The Everlasting Mercy]]''. [[Robert Graves]], in ''[[Good-Bye to All That]]'', describes it as a "parody of Masefield which, midway through, had forgotten to be a parody and turned into rather good Masefield."

Sassoon expressed his opinions on the political situation before the onset of the First World War thus—"France was a lady, [[Russian Empire|Russia]] was a bear, and performing in the county [[cricket]] team was much more important than either of them". Sassoon wanted to play for [[Kent County Cricket Club]]; the Marchant family were neighbours, and [[Frank Marchant]] was captain of the county side between 1890 and 1897. Sassoon often turned out for Bluemantles at the [[Nevill Ground]], Tunbridge Wells, where he sometimes played alongside [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]. He had also played cricket for his house at Marlborough College, once taking 7 wickets for 18 runs. Although an enthusiast, Sassoon was not good enough to play for his county, but he played for Matfield village, and later for a [[Downside Abbey]] team called "The Ravens", continuing into his seventies.<ref name=KSC10122010/><ref name=coldham>Coldham, James D (1954) [http://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketer/content/story/276146.html Siegfried Sassoon and cricket], ''[[The Cricketer]]'', June 1954.

==War service==

===The Western Front: Military Cross===
[[File:Siegfried Sassoon by Glyn Warren Philpot 1917.jpeg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Sassoon by [[Glyn Warren Philpot]], 1917 ([[Fitzwilliam Museum]])]]
Motivated by patriotism, Sassoon joined the Army just as the threat of a new European war was recognized, and was in service with the [[Sussex Yeomanry]] on 4 August 1914, the day the United Kingdom declared war on Germany. He broke his arm badly in a riding accident and was put out of action before leaving England, spending the spring of 1915 convalescing. He was commissioned into the 3rd Battalion ([[Special Reserve (militia)|Special Reserve]]), [[Royal Welch Fusiliers]], as a [[second lieutenant]] on 29 May 1915.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=29175|page=5115|date=28 May 1915}}</ref> On 1 November his younger brother Hamo was killed in the [[Gallipoli Campaign]],<ref>{{cwgc|id=681993|name=Sassoon, Hamo}}</ref> dying on board the ship ''Kildonan Castle'' after having had his leg amputated.<ref>{{cite web|date=7 July 2016| url = https://www.cwgc.org/find-records/find-war-dead/casualty-details/681993/| title = Second Lieutenant Hamo Sassoon

| work =[[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]]| access-date =14 May 2021 }}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=June 2021}} In the same month Siegfried was sent to the 1st Battalion in France, where he met [[Robert Graves]], and they became close friends. United by their poetic vocation, they often read and discussed each other's work. Though this did not have much perceptible influence on Graves' poetry, his views on what may be called 'gritty realism' profoundly affected Sassoon's concept of what constituted poetry. He soon became horrified by the realities of war, and the tone of his writing changed completely: where his early poems exhibit a [[Romanticism|Romantic]], dilettantish sweetness, his war poetry moves to an increasingly discordant music, intended to convey the ugly truths of the trenches to an audience hitherto lulled by patriotic propaganda. Details such as rotting corpses, mangled limbs, filth, cowardice and suicide are all trademarks of his work at this time, and this philosophy of 'no truth unfitting' had a significant effect on the movement towards [[Modernist]] poetry.

Sassoon's periods of duty on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] were marked by exceptionally brave actions, including the single-handed capture of a German trench in the [[Hindenburg Line]]. Armed with grenades, he scattered sixty German soldiers:<ref>Max Egremont, ''Siegfried Sassoon'' (2005), p. 103.</ref><blockquote>He went over with bombs in daylight, under covering fire from a couple of rifles, and scared away the occupants. A pointless feat, since instead of signalling for reinforcements, he sat down in the German trench and began reading a book of poems which he had brought with him. When he went back he did not even report. Colonel Stockwell, then in command, raged at him. The attack on [[Mametz Wood]] had been delayed for two hours because British patrols were still reported to be out. "British patrols" were Siegfried and his book of poems. "I'd have got you a [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], if you'd only shown more sense," stormed Stockwell.<ref>Robert Graves, ''Goodbye to All That'' (London: Penguin, 1960), p. 174.</ref></blockquote>Sassoon's bravery was so inspiring that soldiers of his company said that they felt confident only when they were accompanied by him.<ref>Egremont, ''Siegfried Sassoon'' (2005), p. 99.</ref> He often went out on night raids and bombing patrols, and demonstrated ruthless efficiency as a company commander. Deepening depression at the horror and misery the soldiers were forced to endure produced in Sassoon a paradoxically manic courage, and he was nicknamed "Mad Jack" by his men for his near-suicidal exploits. On 27 July 1916 he was awarded the [[Military Cross]]; the citation read:

{{quote|2nd Lt. Siegfried Lorraine{{sic}} Sassoon, 3rd (attd. 1st) Bn., R. W. Fus.

For conspicuous gallantry during a raid on the enemy's trenches. He remained for 1½ hours under rifle and bomb fire collecting and bringing in our wounded. Owing to his courage and determination all the killed and wounded were brought in.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=29684 |supp=y|page=7441|date=25 July 1916}}</ref>}}

Robert Graves described Sassoon as engaging in suicidal feats of bravery. Sassoon was also later recommended for the [[Victoria Cross]].<ref name=ODNB>{{Cite ODNB |first=Rupert |last=Hart-Davis |title=Sassoon, Siegfried Loraine (1886–1967) |year=2004 |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35953 |access-date=9 July 2009 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/35953}}</ref>

===War opposition and Craiglockhart===
Despite his decorations and reputation, in 1917 Sassoon decided to make a stand against the conduct of the war. One of the reasons for his violent anti-war feeling was the death of his friend [[David Cuthbert Thomas]], who appears as "Dick Tiltwood" in the [[Sherston trilogy]]. Sassoon would spend years trying to overcome his grief.

In August 1916, Sassoon arrived at [[Somerville College, Oxford]], which was used as a hospital for convalescing officers, with a case of gastric fever. He wrote: "To be lying in a little white-walled room, looking through the window on to a College lawn, was for the first few days very much like a paradise". Graves ended up at Somerville as well. "How unlike you to crib my idea of going to the Ladies' College at Oxford", Sassoon wrote to him in 1917.

At the end of a spell of convalescent leave, Sassoon declined to return to duty; instead, encouraged by pacifist friends such as [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]], he sent a letter to his commanding officer entitled ''[[s:Finished with the War: A Soldier’s Declaration|Finished with the War: A Soldier’s Declaration]]''. Forwarded to the press and read out in the House of Commons by a sympathetic member of Parliament, the letter was seen by some as treasonous ("I am making this statement as an act of wilful defiance of military authority") or at best as condemning the war government's motives ("I believe that the war upon which I entered as a war of defence and liberation has now become a war of aggression and conquest"<ref>{{Cite news |url= https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorialopinion/article/887751--war-resisters-also-deserve-a-memorial|title=War resisters also deserve a memorial |author=Peter Smollett |date=9 November 2010|work=Toronto Star |access-date=12 November 2010}}</ref>). Rather than [[court-martial]] Sassoon, the [[Under-Secretary of State for War]], [[Ian Macpherson, 1st Baron Strathcarron|Ian Macpherson]], decided that he was unfit for service and had him sent to [[Craiglockhart War Hospital]] near [[Edinburgh]], where he was officially treated for [[neurasthenia]] ("[[shell shock]]").<ref name=ODNB />

At the end of 1917, Sassoon was posted to [[Limerick]], Ireland, where in the [[Sarsfield Barracks|New Barracks]] he helped train new recruits. He wrote that it was a period of respite for him, and allowed him to indulge in his love of [[Fox Hunting|hunting]]. Reflecting on the period years later, he mentioned how trouble was brewing in Ireland at the time, in the few years before the [[Irish War of Independence]]. After only a short period in Limerick he was posted to Egypt, but not until he had several opportunities to hunt.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sassoon |first1=Siegfried |title=A Limerick Posting |journal=Old Limerick Journal |date=1982 |volume=10 |issue=Spring |pages=29–32 |url=http://www.limerickcity.ie/media/limerick%20posting.pdf |access-date=18 September 2020}}</ref>

For many years it had been thought that, before declining to return to active service, Sassoon had thrown his MC ribbon into the [[River Mersey]] at [[Formby]] beach. According to his description of this incident in ''[[Memoirs of an Infantry Officer]]'' he did not do this as a symbolic rejection of militaristic values, but simply out of the need to perform some destructive act in catharsis of the black mood which was afflicting him; his account states that one of his pre-war sporting trophies, had he had one to hand, would have served his purpose equally well. The actual decoration was rediscovered after the death of Sassoon's only son, George, and subsequently became the subject of a dispute among Sassoon's heirs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12779481.Family_in_row_over_Sassoon_war_medal_sale/|title=Family in row over Sassoon war medal sale|website=The Herald|location=Glasgow|access-date=14 January 2018}}</ref>

At Craiglockhart, Sassoon met [[Wilfred Owen]], another poet. It was thanks to Sassoon that Owen persevered in his ambition to write better poetry. A manuscript copy of Owen's ''[[Anthem for Doomed Youth]]'' containing Sassoon's handwritten amendments survives as testimony to the extent of his influence and is currently on display at London's [[Imperial War Museum]]. Sassoon became to Owen "[[John Keats|Keats]] and Christ and Elijah", according to a surviving letter which demonstrates the depth of Owen's love and admiration for him. Both men returned to active service in France, but Owen was killed in 1918, a week before Armistice. Sassoon was promoted to [[first lieutenant|lieutenant]], and, having spent some time out of danger in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], eventually returned to the Front. On 13 July 1918, Sassoon was wounded again—by [[friendly fire]] when he was shot in the head by a fellow British soldier who had mistaken him for a German near [[Arras]], France. As a result, he spent the remainder of the war in Britain. By this time he had been promoted to acting [[captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]]. He relinquished his commission on health grounds on 12 March 1919, but was allowed to retain the rank of captain.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=31221 |supp=y|page=3269|date=7 March 1919}}</ref>

After the war, Sassoon was instrumental in bringing Owen's work to the attention of a wider audience. Their relationship is the subject of [[Stephen MacDonald]]'s play, ''[[Not About Heroes]]''.

==Post-war life==
===Editor and novelist===
[[File:Quiller-couch letter to Sassoon.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An agreement from [[Arthur Quiller-Couch]] to Sassoon to write for [[Daily Herald (UK newspaper)|''The Daily Herald'']]]]
Having lived for a period at [[Oxford]], where he spent more time visiting literary friends than studying, he dabbled briefly in the politics of the Labour movement, and in 1919 took up a post as literary editor of the socialist ''[[Daily Herald (UK newspaper)|Daily Herald]]''.  He lived at 54 Tufton Street, [[Westminster]], from 1919 to 1925; the house is no longer standing, but the location of his former home is marked by a memorial plaque.<ref>[http://www.westminster.gov.uk/services/leisureandculture/greenplaques/ City of Westminster green plaques.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716210428/http://www.westminster.gov.uk/services/leisureandculture/greenplaques/ |date=16 July 2012 }}</ref>

During his period at the ''Herald'', Sassoon was responsible for employing several eminent names as reviewers, including [[E. M. Forster]] and [[Charlotte Mew]], and commissioned original material from writers like [[Arnold Bennett]] and [[Osbert Sitwell]]. His artistic interests extended to music.  While at Oxford he was introduced to the young [[William Walton]], to whom he became a friend and patron.  Walton later dedicated his ''[[Portsmouth Point (Walton)|Portsmouth Point]]'' overture to Sassoon in recognition of his financial assistance and moral support.

Sassoon later embarked on a lecture tour of the US, as well as travelling in Europe and throughout Britain. He acquired a car, a gift from the publisher [[Frankie Schuster]], and became renowned among his friends for his lack of driving skill, but this did not prevent him making full use of the mobility it gave him.

Sassoon was a great admirer of the Welsh poet [[Henry Vaughan]]. On a visit to Wales in 1923, he paid a pilgrimage to Vaughan's grave at [[Llansantffraed]], [[Powys]], and there wrote one of his best-known peacetime poems, "At the Grave of Henry Vaughan". The deaths within a short space of time of three of his closest friends – [[Edmund Gosse]], [[Thomas Hardy]] and Frankie Schuster – came as another serious setback to his personal happiness.

At the same time, Sassoon was preparing to take a new direction.  While in America, he had experimented with a novel. In 1928, he branched out into prose, with ''[[Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man]]'', the anonymously-published first volume of a fictionalised autobiography, which was almost immediately accepted as a classic, bringing its author new fame as a prose writer. The memoir, whose mild-mannered central character is content to do little more than be an idle country gentleman, playing cricket, riding and hunting foxes, is often humorous, revealing a side of Sassoon that had been little seen in his work during the war years. The book won the 1928 [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize|James Tait Black Award]] for fiction. Sassoon followed it with ''[[Memoirs of an Infantry Officer]]'' (1930) and ''[[Sherston's Progress]]'' (1936). In later years, he revisited his youth and early manhood with three volumes of genuine autobiography, which were also widely acclaimed.  These were ''The Old Century'', ''The Weald of Youth'' and ''Siegfried's Journey''.

===Affairs===
Sassoon, having matured greatly as a result of his military service, continued to seek emotional fulfilment, initially in a succession of love affairs with men, including:

===Marriage===
In September 1931, Sassoon rented Fitz House, [[Teffont Magna]], Wiltshire, and began to live there.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LO9KDzIYSZoC|title=Siegfried Sassoon: The Journey from the Trenches : a Biography (1918–1967)|first=Jean Moorcroft|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-415-96713-6|pages=255|last=Wilson}}</ref> In December 1933, he married Hester Gatty (daughter of [[Stephen Herbert Gatty]]), who was twenty years his junior. The marriage led to the birth of a child, something Sassoon had purportedly craved for a long time.

Siegfried's son, [[George Sassoon]] (1936–2006), became a scientist, linguist, and author, and was adored by Siegfried, who wrote several poems addressed to him.

Siegfried's marriage broke down after [[World War II|the Second World War]], with Sassoon apparently unable to find a compromise between the solitude he enjoyed and the companionship he craved. Separated from his wife in 1945, Sassoon lived in seclusion at [[Heytesbury]] in Wiltshire, although he maintained contact with a circle which included [[E. M. Forster|E M Forster]] and [[J. R. Ackerley|J R Ackerley]]. One of his closest friends was the cricketer [[Dennis Silk]] who later became Warden (headmaster) of [[Radley College]]. He also formed a close friendship with Vivien Hancock, then headmistress of [[Greenways School]] at [[Ashton Gifford House|Ashton Gifford]], where his son George was a pupil. The relationship provoked Hester to make strong accusations against Hancock, who responded with the threat of legal action.{{Sfn|Wilson|2003|p=|pp=345–6}}

===Religion===
Towards the end of his life, Sassoon converted to Roman Catholicism. He had hoped that [[Ronald Knox]], a Roman Catholic priest and writer whom he admired, would instruct him in the faith, but Knox was too ill to do so.<ref>[http://www.catholicauthors.com/knox.html Catholic Authors – Ronald Knox]</ref> The priest Sebastian Moore was chosen to instruct him instead, and Sassoon was admitted to the faith at [[Downside Abbey]] in Somerset.<ref>{{Citation

==Legacy==
[[File:Siegfried Sassoon 23 Campden Hill Square blue plaque.jpg|thumb|left|[[Blue plaque]], 23 Campden Hill Square, London]]
On 11 November 1985, Sassoon was among sixteen Great War poets commemorated on a slate stone unveiled in [[Westminster Abbey]]'s [[Poet's Corner]].<ref>[http://net.lib.byu.edu/english/wwi/poets/poets.html Poets of the Great War.]</ref> The inscription on the stone was written by friend and fellow War poet [[Wilfred Owen]]. It reads: "My subject is War, and the pity of War. The Poetry is in the pity."<ref>[http://net.lib.byu.edu/english/wwi/poets/Preface.html "Preface", Manuscript and transcription from ''The Poems of Wilfred Owen''.]</ref>

The year 2003 saw the publication of ''Memorial Tablet'', an authorised audio CD of readings by Sassoon recorded during the late 1950s. These included extracts from ''[[Memoirs of an Infantry Officer]]'' and ''The Weald of Youth'', as well as several war poems including Attack, The Dug-Out, At Carnoy and Died of Wounds, and postwar works. The CD also included comment on Sassoon by three of his Great War contemporaries: [[Edmund Blunden]], [[Edgell Rickword]] and [[Henry Williamson]].<ref>[http://www.ltmrecordings.com/SassoonCD.html Siegfried Sassoon, ''Memorial Tablet'' CD audiobook (CD41-008).]</ref>

Siegfried Sassoon's only child, [[George Sassoon]], died of cancer in 2006. George had three children, two of whom were killed in a car crash in 1996. His daughter by his first marriage, Kendall Sassoon, is Patron-in-Chief of the Siegfried Sassoon Fellowship, established in 2001.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sassoonfellowship.org/|title=The Siegfried Sassoon Fellowship|website=sassoonfellowship.org|access-date=10 March 2017}}</ref>

Sassoon's other service medals went unclaimed until 1985 when his son George obtained them from the Army Medal Office, then based at [[Droitwich]]. The "late claim" medals consisting of the [[1914-15 Star]], [[Victory Medal (United Kingdom)|Victory Medal]] and [[British War Medal]] along with Sassoon's [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] and Warrant of Appointment were auctioned by [[Sotheby's]] in 2008.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/catalogues/ecatalogue.html/2008/english-literature-history-children39s-books-and-illustrationsl08411#/r=/en/ecat.fhtml.L08411.html+r.m=/en/ecat.lot.L08411.html/123/+r.o=/en/ecat.notes.L08411.html/123/|title=Auction of medals}}</ref>

In June 2009, the [[University of Cambridge]] announced plans to purchase an archive of Sassoon's papers from his family, to be added to the university library's existing Sassoon collection.<ref>[http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/dp/2009062501 University of Cambridge news]</ref> On 4 November 2009 it was reported that this purchase would be supported by £550,000 from the [[National Heritage Memorial Fund]], meaning that the University still needed to raise a further £110,000 on top of the money already received to meet the full £1.25&nbsp;million asking price.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/nov/04/siegfried-sassoon-archive-award-cambridge|title=Siegfried Sassoon archive likely to stay in UK after £550,000 award•Siegfried Sassoon papers attracted interest from US•Cambridge library still short of asking price|first=Mark|last=Brown|work=The Guardian |date=4 November 2009|access-date=4 November 2009 | location=London}}</ref> The funds were successfully raised, and in December 2009 it was announced that the University had received the papers. Included in the collection are war diaries kept by Sassoon while he served on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] and in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], a draft of "[[s:Finished with the War: A Soldier’s Declaration|A Soldier's Declaration]]" (1917), notebooks from his schooldays, and post-war journals.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5BH00F20091218?type=artsNews|title=Cambridge acquires anti-war poet Sassoon's papers|first=Mike|last=Collett-White|date=17 December 2009|access-date=31 December 2009}}</ref> Other items in the collection include love letters to his wife Hester, and photographs and letters from other writers. Sassoon was an undergraduate at the university, as well as being made an honorary fellow of [[Clare College]], and the collection is housed at the [[Cambridge University Library]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Sassoon Journals|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/collections/sassoon|publisher=Cambridge Digital Library|access-date=1 August 2014}}</ref> As well as private individuals, funding came from the Monument Trust, the JP Getty Jr Trust, and Sir [[Siegmund Warburg]]'s Voluntary Settlement.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cambridgeshire/8418787.stm|title=War poet Siegfried Sassoon's papers arrive in Cambridge|work=BBC News|date=17 December 2009|access-date=31 December 2009}}</ref>

In 2010, ''Dream Voices: Siegfried Sassoon, Memory and War'', a major exhibition of Sassoon's life and archive, was held at Cambridge University.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jul/21/sassoon-notebook-exhibition-cambridge Siegfried Sassoon archive goes on show at Cambridge] Maev Kennedy, ''The Guardian'', Wednesday, 21 July 2010.</ref>

Several of Sassoon's poems have been set to music,<ref>{{cite web|title=Music|url=http://siegfried-sassoon.firstworldwarrelics.co.uk/html/music.html|website=Siegfried Sassoon Bibliography|access-date=14 March 2018}}</ref> some during his lifetime, by [[Cyril Rootham]], who co-operated with the author.<ref>{{cite web|title=Set to music|url=https://sassoon.blog.lib.cam.ac.uk/?cat=70|work=Sassoon Project blog|publisher=[[Cambridge University Library]]|access-date=19 January 2013|author=John|date=October 2010}}</ref>

The discovery in 2013 of an early draft of one of Sassoon's best-known anti-war poems had biographers saying they would rewrite portions of their work about the poet. In the poem, 'Atrocities,' which concerned the killing of German prisoners by their British counterparts, the early draft shows that some lines were cut and others watered down. The poet's publisher was nervous about publishing the poem, and held it for publication in an expurgated version at a later date. Said Sassoon biographer [[Jean Moorcroft Wilson]] on learning of the discovery of the early draft: "This is very exciting material. I want to rewrite my biography and I probably shall be able to get some of it in. It's a treasure trove."<ref>{{cite news|last=Alberge|first=Dalya|title=Draft Siegfried Sassoon poem reveals controversial lines cut from Atrocities: Manuscript shows World War I poet toned down piece about British soldiers killing German prisoners|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/03/siegfried-sassoon-poem-atrocities|newspaper=The Observer|date=2 February 2013}}</ref>

In early 2019, it was announced in ''The Guardian'' newspaper that a student from the University of Warwick, whilst looking through Glen Byam Shaw's records at the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, had accidentally discovered a Sassoon poem addressed to the former, which had not previously been published in its entirety.<ref>{{cite news|last=Alberge|first=Dalya|title=Student discovers lost Siegfried Sassoon poem to young lover|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/09/student-discovers-new-siegfried-sassoon-love-poem|newspaper=[[The Observer]]|date=10 June 2019|access-date=5 November 2019}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
A 1970 instalment of [[The Wednesday Play]] entitled ''Mad Jack'' based around Sassoon's wartime experiences and their aftermath leading to his renunciation of his Military Cross starred [[Michael Jayston]] as Sassoon. The novel ''[[Regeneration (novel)|Regeneration]]'', by [[Pat Barker]], is a fictionalised account of this period in Sassoon's life, and was made into a [[Regeneration (1997 film)|film]] starring [[James Wilby]] as Sassoon and [[Jonathan Pryce]] as [[W. H. R. Rivers]], the psychiatrist responsible for Sassoon's treatment. Rivers became a kind of surrogate father to the troubled young man, and his sudden death in 1922 was a major blow to Sassoon.

In 2014, [[John Hurt]] played the older Sassoon and [[Morgan Watkins]] the young Sassoon in ''The Pity of War'', a BBC docu-drama.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.radiotimes.com/tv-programme/e/ffwp9z/the-pity-of-war-the-loves-and-lives-of-the-war-poets/|title=The Pity of War: The Loves and Lives of the War Poets|author=Alison Graham|website=Radio Times|access-date=9 October 2020}}</ref>

A film named ''The Burying Party'' (released August 2018) depicts [[Wilfred Owen]]'s final year from Craiglockhart Hospital to the [[Battle of the Sambre (1918)]], including his meeting with Sassoon at the hospital. Matthew Staite stars as Owen and Sid Phoenix as Sassoon.
