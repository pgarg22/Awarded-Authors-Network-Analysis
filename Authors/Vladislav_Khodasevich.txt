'''Vladislav Felitsianovich Khodasevich''' ({{lang-ru|Владисла́в Фелициа́нович Ходасе́вич}}; May 16, 1886 – June 14, 1939) was an influential [[Russia]]n poet and literary critic who presided over the [[Berlin]] circle of Russian emigre [[wiktionary:Litterateur|litterateur]]s.

==Life and career==
Khodasevich was born in [[Moscow]] into a family of Felitsian Khodasevich (Polish: ''Felicjan Chodasiewicz''), a [[Poles|Polish]] nobleman, and Sofiia Iakovlevna (née Brafman), a woman of [[Jew]]ish descent whose family had converted to Christianity.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cagjAQAAIAAJ&q=Vladislav+Khodasevich+Brafman|title=Critical Survey of Poetry|last=Jason|first=Philip K.|date=2003|publisher=Salem Press|isbn=9781587650758|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GJ7KAAAAMAAJ&q=Vladislav+Khodasevich+Brafman|title=Life beyond the lyric: the prose autobiographies of Russian poets|last=Loewen|first=Donald James|date=2001|publisher=University of Wisconsin--Madison|language=en}}</ref> His grandfather [[Jacob Brafman]] was famous as a Jewish convert to [[Russian Orthodoxy]] who authored ''The Book of the [[Qahal|Kahal]]'' (1869), a polemical forerunner of the ''[[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]''. His cousin [[Nadia Khodasevich Léger|Nadia Khodasevich]] married [[Fernand Léger]]. He left the [[Moscow University]] after understanding that poetry was his true vocation. Khodasevich's first collections of poems, ''Youth'' (1907) and ''A Happy Little House'' (1914), were subsequently discarded by him as immature.

In the year 1917, Khodasevich gained wider renown by writing a superb short piece ''The Way of Corn'', a reflection on the biblical image of wheat as a plant that cannot live if it does not first die. This poem is [[eponym]]ous with Khodasevich's best known collection of verse, first published in 1920 and revised in 1922.

Patronized by [[Maxim Gorky]], Khodasevich and his wife [[Nina Berberova]] (herself a distinguished littérateur, 1901–1993) left Russia for Gorky's villa in [[Sorrento, Italy]]. Later they moved to [[Berlin]], where they took up with [[Andrei Bely]]. Khodasevich's complicated relationship with this maverick genius ended with a scandalous rupture, followed by the latter's return to [[Moscow]]. In his memoirs, Bely presented an unforgettable, expressionistic, and very partial portrayal of Khodasevich.

During his first years in Berlin, Khodasevich wrote his two last and most metaphysical collections of verse, ''Heavy Lyre'' (1923) and ''European Night'' (1927). The former contained the most important rendition of the [[Orpheus]] theme in Russian poetry, the esoteric ''Ballad''. Khodasevich did not align himself with any of the aesthetic movements of the day, claiming [[Alexander Pushkin]] to be his only model. He even penned several scholarly articles exploring the master-stroke of the great Russian poet.

In the mid-1920s, Khodasevich switched his literary activities from poetry to criticism. He joined [[Mark Aldanov]] and [[Alexander Kerensky]] as the co-editor of the Berlin periodical ''Days'', in which he would publish his penetrating analyses of the contemporary [[Soviet literature]]. He also indulged in a prolonged controversy with the Parisian emigre pundits, such as [[Georgy Adamovich]] and [[Georgy Ivanov]], on various issues of literary theory. As an influential critic, Khodasevich did his best to encourage the career of [[Vladimir Nabokov]], who would always cherish his memory.

Despite a physical infirmity that gradually took hold of him, Khodasevich worked relentlessly during the last decade of his life. Most notably, he wrote an important biography of [[Gavrila Derzhavin]] (translated into English and published by [[University of Wisconsin Press]] in 2007) in 1931, which he attempted to style in the language of Pushkin's epoch. Several weeks before Khodasevich's death, his brilliant book of memoirs, ''Necropolis'', was published. Although severely partisan, the book is invaluable for its ingenious characterizations of [[Maxim Gorky]], [[Andrei Bely]], and [[Mikhail Gershenzon]]. He died from cancer of the liver in 1939.<ref>Khodasevich, Vladislav. 2014. ''Selected Poems,'' 1st Edition. Peter Daniels (Translator), Michael Wachtel (Introduction). The Overlook Press. 2014.
