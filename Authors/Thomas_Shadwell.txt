'''Thomas Shadwell''' ({{circa|1642}} – 19 November 1692) was an [[England|English]] [[poet]] and [[playwright]] who was appointed [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]] in 1689.

==Life==
Shadwell was born at either Bromehill Farm, [[Weeting-with-Broomhill]] or Santon House, [[Lynford]], [[Norfolk]],<ref>Clarke, WG (1937). In Breckland Wilds. Heffer & Sons Ltd, Cambridge; 2nd edition, p.142</ref> and educated at [[Bury St Edmunds]] School, and at [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]], which he entered in 1656.<ref>{{acad|id=SHDL656T|name=Shadwell, Thomas}}</ref> He left the university without a degree, and joined the [[Middle Temple]]. At the [[Glorious Revolution|Whig triumph in 1688]], he superseded [[John Dryden]] as poet laureate and historiographer royal. He died at Chelsea on 19 November 1692.<ref name="life1">[http://www.malaspina.org/home.asp?topic=./search/details&lastpage=./search/results&ID=20 Thomas Shadwell] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041128214840/http://www.malaspina.org/home.asp?topic=.%2Fsearch%2Fdetails |date=28 November 2004 }}</ref> He was buried in [[Chelsea Old Church]], but his tomb was destroyed by wartime bombing. A memorial to him with a bust by [[Francis Bird]] survives in [[Poets' Corner]] in [[Westminster Abbey]].<ref>Dictionary of British Sculptors 1660-1851 by Rupert Gunnis</ref>

He was married to the actress [[Anne Shadwell]], who appeared in several of his plays. They had four children including the playwright [[Charles Shadwell (playwright)|Charles Shadwell]] and John Shadwell, a [[physician]] who attended to both [[Queen Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] and [[George I of Great Britain|George I]].<ref>Highfill, Philip H, Burnim, Kalman A. & Langhans, Edward A. ''A Biographical Dictionary of Actors, Actresses, Musicians, Dancers, Managers & Other Stage Personnel in London, 1660-1800, Volume 13''. SIU Press, 1991. p.276</ref>

==Works==
In 1668 he produced a prose comedy, ''[[The Sullen Lovers]]'', or the ''Impertinents'', based on ''Les Fâcheux'' by [[Molière]], and written in open imitation of [[Ben Jonson]]'s comedy of humours. His best plays are ''[[Epsom Wells]]'' (1672), for which Sir [[Charles Sedley]] wrote a prologue, and ''[[The Squire of Alsatia]]'' (1688). [[Alsatia]] was the [[Thieves' cant|cant]] name for the [[Carmelites|Whitefriars]] area of London, then a kind of sanctuary for persons liable to arrest, and the play represents, in dialogue full of the local [[argot]], the adventures of a young heir who falls into the hands of the sharpers there.<ref name="works1">[http://education.yahoo.com/reference/encyclopedia/entry/Shadwell Shadwell] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609090123/http://education.yahoo.com/reference/encyclopedia/entry/Shadwell |date=9 June 2012 }}</ref><ref name="works2">[http://www.malaspina.org/home.asp?topic=./search/details&lastpage=./search/results&ID=20 Thomas Shadwell biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041128214840/http://www.malaspina.org/home.asp?topic=.%2Fsearch%2Fdetails |date=28 November 2004 }}</ref>

For fourteen years from the production of his first comedy to his memorable encounter with [[John Dryden]], Shadwell produced a play nearly every year. These productions display a hatred of sham, and a rough but honest moral purpose. Although bawdy, they present a vivid picture of contemporary manners.<ref name="works5">{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/233/000101927/ |title=NNDB |publisher=NNDB |access-date=2018-06-19}}</ref>

Shadwell is chiefly remembered as the unfortunate [[Mac Flecknoe]] of Dryden's satire, the "last great prophet of [[Tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]]," and the literary son and heir of [[Richard Flecknoe]]:
<blockquote>
"The rest to some faint meaning make pretense, <br />
But Shadwell never deviates into sense."
<ref name="dry1">{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/81/10703.html |title=MacFleck'noe |publisher=Bartleby.com |access-date=2018-06-19}}</ref></blockquote>

Dryden had furnished Shadwell with a prologue to his ''True Widow'' (1679) and, in spite of momentary differences, the two had been on friendly terms. But when Dryden joined the court party, and produced ''[[Absalom and Achitophel]]'' and ''The Medal'', Shadwell became the champion of the [[Protestant]]s, and made a scurrilous attack on Dryden in ''The Medal of John Bayes: a Satire against Folly and Knavery'' (1682). Dryden immediately retorted in ''Mac Flecknoe, or a Satire on the True Blue Protestant Poet, T.S.'' (1682), in which Shadwell's personalities were returned with interest. A month later he contributed to [[Nahum Tate]]'s continuation of ''Absalom and Achitophel'' satirical portraits of [[Elkanah Settle]] as [[Doeg the Edomite|Doeg]] and of Shadwell as [[Og]]. In 1687, Shadwell attempted to answer these attacks in a version of [[Satire X|Juvenal's 10th Satire]].<ref name="works5"/>

However, Dryden's portrait of Shadwell in ''Absalom and Achitophel'' cut far deeper, and has withstood the test of time.  In this satire, Dryden noted of Settle and Shadwell:

<blockquote>
Two fools that crutch their feeble sense on verse;<br />
Who, by my muse, to all succeeding times <br />
Shall live, in spite of their own doggrel rhymes;   
<ref name="dry2">{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/218/0720.html |title=Satire |publisher=Bartleby.com |access-date=2018-06-19}}</ref></blockquote>

Nonetheless, Shadwell, due to the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] triumph in 1688, superseded his enemy as [[Poet Laureate]] and [[historiographer]] royal.<ref name="works5"/>

His son, [[Charles Shadwell (playwright)|Charles Shadwell]] was also a playwright. A scene from his play, ''The [[Stockjobber]]s'' was included as an introduction in [[Caryl Churchill]]'s ''Serious Money'' (1987).<ref name="life1"/>

Dear pretty youth, unveil your eyes,<br /> 
How can you sleep when I am by?<br /> 
Were I with you all night to be,<br /> 
Methinks I could from sleep be free.<br /> 
Alas, my dear, you're cold as stone:<br /> 
You must no longer lie alone.<br /> 
But be with me my dear, and I in each arm<br /> 
Will hug you close and keep you warm.
