'''Margaret Rumer Godden''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OBE}} (10 December 1907&nbsp;– 8 November 1998<ref name="IndepObit">{{cite web | last = Guttridge | first = Peter | title = Obituary: Rumer Godden | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-rumer-godden-1184108.html | website = www.independent.co.uk | date = 11 November 1998 | access-date = 17 September 2016}}</ref>) was an English author of more than 60 [[fiction]] and [[non-fiction]] books. Nine of her works have been made into films,<ref name="RGtrust">{{cite web | title = Rumer Godden Literary Trust homepage | url = http://www.rumergodden.com/index.php | website = www.rumergodden.com | access-date = 17 September 2016}}</ref> most notably ''[[Black Narcissus (novel)|Black Narcissus]]'' in 1947 and ''[[The River (1951 film)|The River]]'' in 1951.

A few of her works were co-written with her elder sister, novelist [[Jon Godden]], including ''[[Two Under the Indian Sun]]'', a memoir of the Goddens' childhood in a region of India now part of [[Bangladesh]].

==Early life==
[[File:Cover of Black Narcissus (1939) by Rumer Godden.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''Black Narcissus'' (1939), published by Little, Brown & Co.]]
Godden was born in [[Eastbourne]],<ref name="IndepObit"/> [[Sussex]], England. She grew up with her three sisters in [[Narayanganj]], [[British Raj|colonial India]] (now in [[Bangladesh]]), where her father, a shipping company executive, worked for the [[Brahmaputra|Brahmaputra Steam Navigation Company]].<ref name=dnb>{{citation |last=Chisholm |first=Anne |contribution=Godden, (Margaret) Rumer (1907–1998) |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/71256 |title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |edition=online |publisher=Oxford University Press |access-date=11 December 2012 |year=2004}} {{subscription required}}</ref> Her parents sent the girls to England for schooling, as was the custom of the time, but brought them back to Narayanganj when the [[First World War]] began. 

Godden returned to the United Kingdom with her sisters to continue her interrupted schooling in 1920, spending time at [[Moira House Girls School]] in Eastbourne and eventually training as a dance teacher. She went back to [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] in 1925 and opened a dance school for English and Indian children.<ref name=dnb/> Godden ran the school for 20 years with the help of her sister Nancy. During this time she published her first best-seller, the 1939 novel ''[[Black Narcissus (novel)|Black Narcissus]]''.

==Writing career==
[[File:Greengage summer.JPG|thumb|upright|''The Greengage Summer'' (1958), 1962 Pan paperback edition]]
In 1942, after eight years in an unhappy marriage (one she entered into in 1934 because she was pregnant),<ref name=dnb/> she moved with her two daughters, Jane and Paula,<ref name="NYTObit">{{cite web | last = Yarrow | first = Andrew L. | title = Rumer Godden, an Author Who Evoked Her Childhood in Colonial India, Is Dead at 90 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/10/books/rumer-godden-an-author-who-evoked-her-childhood-in-colonial-india-is-dead-at-90.html | website = www.nytimes.com | date = 11 November 1998 | access-date = 17 September 2016}}</ref> (her husband Laurence Foster having joined the army)<ref name=dnb/> to [[Kashmir]], living first on a houseboat and then in a rented house where she started a farm. The novel ''[[Kingfishers Catch Fire]]'' was based on her time in Kashmir. After a mysterious incident in which it appeared that an attempt had been made to poison both her and her daughters, she returned to Calcutta in 1944. She returned to the United Kingdom in 1945 to concentrate on her writing, frequently moving house but living mostly in [[Sussex]] and London. She was divorced in 1948.<ref name=dnb/> After returning from America to oversee the script for the movie of her book ''[[The River (1951 film)|The River]]'', Godden married civil servant James Haynes Dixon on 26{{nbsp}}November 1949.

In the early 1950s Godden became interested in the Catholic Church, though she did not officially convert until 1968,<ref>{{citation |last=Tickle |first=Phyllis |title=Introduction to ''In This House of Brede'' |year=2005 |publisher=Loyola Classics}}</ref> and several of her later novels contain sympathetic portrayals of Catholic priests and nuns. In addition to ''Black Narcissus'', two of her books deal with the subject of women in religious communities. In ''Five for Sorrow, Ten for Joy'' and ''[[In This House of Brede]]'' she acutely examined the balance between the mystical, spiritual aspects of religion and the practical, human realities of religious life.

A number of Godden's novels are set in India, the atmosphere of which she evokes through all the senses; her writing is vivid with detail of smells, textures, light, flowers, noises and tactile experiences. Her books for children, especially her several doll stories, strongly convey the secret thoughts, confusions, disappointments and aspirations of childhood.  Her plots often involve unusual young people not recognised for their talents by ordinary lower- or middle-class people but supported by the educated, rich, and upper-class, to the anger, resentment, and puzzlement of their relatives. She won a [[1972 Whitbread Awards|1972 Whitbread award]] for ''[[The Diddakoi]]'', a young adult novel about Gypsies, televised by the BBC as ''[[Kizzy (TV series)|Kizzy]]''.<ref name=dnb/>

==Later life and death==
In 1968 she took the tenancy of [[Lamb House]] in [[Rye, East Sussex]], where she lived until the death of her husband in 1973. She moved to [[Moniaive]] in [[Dumfriesshire]] in 1978, when she was 70, to be near her daughter Jane.<ref name=dnb/> She was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in 1993. She visited India once more, in 1994, returning to Kashmir for the filming of a BBC ''Bookmark'' documentary about her life and books.

Rumer Godden died on 8 November 1998 at the age of 90 after a series of strokes; her ashes were buried with those of her second husband in Rye.<ref name=dnb/>
