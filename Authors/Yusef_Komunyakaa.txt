'''Yusef Komunyakaa''' (born '''James William Brown'''; April 29, 1941)<ref name=wifebook/> is an [[United States|American]] poet who teaches at [[New York University]] and is a member of the [[Fellowship of Southern Writers]]. Komunyakaa is a recipient of the 1994 [[Kingsley Tufts Poetry Award]], for ''Neon Vernacular''<ref>Neon Vernacular [https://books.google.com/books?id=1nclTH1WxScC&pg=PP1&dq=neon+vernacular&sig=ACfU3U1pwzA-N5uO7nKVfF-BpIrLdDVwKw excerpts]</ref> and the 1994 [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]]. He also received the [[Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize]]. Komunyakaa received the 2007 [[Louisiana Writer Award]] for his enduring contribution to the poetry world.

His subject matter ranges from the black experience through rural Southern life before the [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights]] era and his experience as a soldier during the [[Vietnam War]].

==Life and career==
According to public records, Komunyakaa was born in 1947 and given the name James William Brown. (His former wife said in her memoir that he was born in 1941.)<ref name=wifebook/> He was the eldest of five children of James William Brown, a carpenter, and his wife.<ref>[http://www.blackpast.org/?q=aah/komunyakaa-yusef-1947 "Yusef Komunyakaa"],  BlackPast.org, Retrieved 28 March 2011</ref> He grew up in the small town of [[Bogalusa]], [[Louisiana]]. As an adult, he reclaimed the name ''Komunyakaa'', said to be his grandfather's African name. He  said that his grandfather had reached the United States as a stowaway in a ship from [[Trinidad]].<!-- ? --> {{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Brown served in the [[US Army]], serving one tour of duty in [[South Vietnam]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. According to his former wife, [[Mandy Sayer]], he was discharged on 14 December 1966.<ref name=wifebook/> He worked as a specialist for the military paper, ''Southern Cross,'' covering actions and stories, interviewing fellow soldiers, and publishing articles on [[Vietnamese history]], which earned him a [[Bronze Star]].

After his service, he attended college at the [[University of Colorado, Colorado Springs]], where he was an editor for the campus arts and literature publication, ''riverrun'', to which he also contributed. He began to write poetry in 1973 and took the name Yusef Komunyakaa. He earned his M.A. in Writing from [[Colorado State University]] in 1978, and an M.F.A. in Creative Writing from the [[University of California, Irvine]] in 1980. After receiving his M.F.A., Komunyakaa began teaching poetry in the New Orleans public school system and creative writing at the [[University of New Orleans]].

Komunyakaa taught at Indiana University until the fall of 1997, when he became an English professor at [[Princeton University]]. Yusef Komunyakaa is a professor in the Creative Writing Program at [[New York University]].

==Poetry==
[[Image:Yusef Komunyakaa by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Komunyakaa at the 2006 [[Brooklyn Book Festival]].]] Komunyakaa's collection ''Copacetic'' fuses jazz rhythms and syncopation with hip colloquialism and the unique, arresting poetic imagery that has since become his trademark. It also outlines an abiding desire in his work to articulate cultural truths that remain unspoken in daily discourse, in the hope that they will bring a sort of redemption: "How can love heal / the mouth shut this way... / Say something that resuscitates / us, behind the masks."

Komunyakaa's ''I Apologize for the Eyes in My Head'', published in 1986, won the [[San Francisco Poetry Prize]]. More attention came with the publication of ''Dien Cai Dau'' ([[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] for "crazy in the head"), published in 1988, which focused on his experiences in Vietnam and won the [[Dark Room Poetry Prize]]. Included was the poem "Facing It", in which the speaker of the poems visits the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]] in Washington, D.C.:

:He's lost his right arm
:inside the stone. In the black mirror
:a woman's trying to erase names
:No, she's brushing a boy's hair.
::— from "Facing It"<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/ipa/poems/komunyakaa/facing_it.php Yusef Komunyakaa: Facing It at The Internet Poetry Archive]</ref>

Komunyakaa many other published collections of poetry, include ''Taboo: The Wishbone Trilogy, Part I'' (2004), ''Pleasure Dome: New and Collected Poems, 1975–1999'' (2001),<ref>''Pleasure Dome: New and Collected Poems'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=oqD0VooTCloC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Yusef+Komunyakaa&sig=ACfU3U0hoXUJsg2onG3m8VfwYkHk0vXygA excerpts]</ref> ''Talking Dirty to the Gods'' (2000), ''Thieves of Paradise'' (1998), ''Neon Vernacular'' (1994), and ''Magic City'' (1992).

In 2004, Komunyakaa began a collaboration with [[dramaturge]] and theater producer [[Chad Gracia]] on a dramatic adaptation of ''The [[Epic of Gilgamesh]].'' The play was published in October 2006 by [[Wesleyan University Press]]. In spring 2008, New York's [[92nd Street Y]] staged a one-night performance by director Robert Scanlon. In May 2013 it received a full production by the [[Constellation Theatre Company (Washington, D.C.)|Constellation Theatre Company]] in Washington, D.C.
<!-- removed 08jul21 since neither the award nor the building seem to be important enough.In 2007, Komunyakaa was awarded the [[Robert Creeley Poetry Award]] and visited the [[Parker Damon building]] to read some of his poetry to a receiving Massachusett's community.-->

Komunyakaa's work has influenced many later American poets. He views his own work as an indirectness, an "insinuation":<ref>[http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/poets/g_l/komunyakaa/poetry.htm What is poetry], from "Notations in Blue: Interview with Radiclani Clytus", in ''Blue Notes: Essays, Interviews and Commentaries'', ed. Radiclani Clytus (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 2000).</ref>
:Poetry is a kind of distilled insinuation. It’s a way of expanding and talking around an idea or a question. Sometimes, more actually gets said through such a technique than a full frontal assault.

==Marriage and family==
Komunyakaa married [[Australian]] novelist [[Mandy Sayer]] in 1985. That year, he was hired as an associate professor at [[Indiana University]] in [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]]. He also held the Ruth Lilly Professorship for two years from 1989 to 1990. He and Sayer were married for ten years. 

He later had a relationship with India-born poet [[Reetika Vazirani]], and they had a son Jehan together. Vazirani killed the two-year-old boy and committed suicide in 2003.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/the-failing-light-why-did-a-rising-young-poet-plunge-into-despair-taking-her-own-life-and-the-life-of-her-2-year-old-son/2015/01/15/2575a388-9d1f-11e4-96cc-e858eba91ced_story.html |title=The Failing Light: Why did a rising young poet plunge into despair, taking her own life and the life of her 2-year-old son? |last1=Span |first1=Paula |date=February 15, 2004 |work=The Washington Post |access-date=December 5, 2015}}</ref>

== Interviews ==
Over the years, Komunyakaa has taken part in many interviews on his life and works. In a 2018 Interview titled "The Complexity of Being Human,"<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://fightandfiddle.com/2018/05/01/the-complexity-of-being-human-an-interview-with-yusef-komunyakaa/|title=The Complexity of Being Human: An Interview with Yusef Komunyakaa|last=lkapoet|date=2018-05-01|website=The Fight and The Fiddle|language=en|access-date=2019-11-17}}</ref> Komunyakaa addresses the careful use of language and influences of some of his most famous works such as "Facing It."<ref name=":0" /> He compares his work to that of a painter or carpenter.<ref name=":0" /> He states that poetry is vastly different from journalism in that his work is more violent, much like nature.<ref name=":0" />

In his interview "The Singing Underneath," Komunyakaa describes the biblical influences in his work.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://teachersandwritersmagazine.org/the-singing-underneath-878.htm|title=Interview with Yusef Komunyakaa: The Singing Underneath|date=2015-01-19|website=Teachers & Writers Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-17}}</ref> He recalls reading the Bible in his youth and discovering what he believed to be underlying poetic elements.<ref name=":1" /> Komunyakaa also pays his respects to early influences such as Langston Hughes, Paul Laurence Dunbar, and Phillis Wheatley.<ref name=":1" />

In a 2010 interview by ''Tufts Observer'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tuftsobserver.org/|title=Tufts Observer|website=Tufts Observer|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-17}}</ref> Komunyakaa when asked to list the individuals who most influenced him, he names Robert Hayden, Bishop, Pablo Neruda, and Whitman.
