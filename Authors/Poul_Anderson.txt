== Biography ==
Poul Anderson was born on November 25, 1926, in [[Bristol, Pennsylvania]] to Scandinavian parents.<ref>''Tau Zero'', SF Masterworks edition.</ref> Shortly after his birth, his father, Anton Anderson moved the family to Texas, where they lived for over ten years. Following Anton Anderson's death, his widow took the children to [[Denmark]]. The family returned to the United States after the outbreak of [[World War II]], settling eventually on a Minnesota farm.
 
While he was an undergraduate student at the [[University of Minnesota]], Anderson's first stories were published by [[John W. Campbell]] in ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'': "Tomorrow's Children" by Anderson and F. N. Waldrop in March 1947 and a sequel, "Chain of Logic" by Anderson alone, in July.{{efn|Anderson continued his first two stories more than a decade later. He added a novella and an epilogue, constituting the collection of four pieces (termed a novel), ''Twilight World: A Science Fiction Novel of Tomorrow's Children'' ([[Dodd, Mead]]). Waldrop was not credited.<ref name=isfdb />}} He earned his [[B.A.]] in physics with honors but became a freelance writer after he graduated in 1948. He placed his third story in the December ''Astounding''.<ref name=isfdb />

Anderson married [[Karen Anderson (writer)|Karen Kruse]] in 1953 and moved with her to the San Francisco Bay area. Their daughter Astrid (now married to science fiction author [[Greg Bear]]) was born in 1954. They made their home in [[Orinda, California]]. Over the years Poul gave many readings at [[The Other Change of Hobbit]] bookstore in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]; his widow later donated his typewriter and desk to the store.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

In 1965, [[Algis Budrys]] said that Anderson "has for some time been science fiction's best storyteller".<ref name="budrys196502">{{Cite magazine
