In addition, she wrote poems and prose for children and plays.

==Early life and education==
Kersti Merilaas was born Eugenie Moorberg in [[Narva]], Estonia shortly before the outbreak of the [[First World War]]. She spent her early childhood in [[St. Petersburg, Russia]] with her mother, Anna Moorberg and sister. The family returned to Estonia in 1917 because of the turmoil of the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]]. From 1921 to 1927 she attended school in the village of [[Kiltsi]], then furthered her studies in [[Väike-Maarja]] and [[Rakvere]] in [[Lääne-Viru County]].<ref>[http://www.v-maarja.ee/?part=html&id=35&lng=eng Väike-Maarja World]</ref> In 1932, she completed high school in [[Tapa, Estonia|Tapa]], Estonia.

==Career==
In 1935, she made her literary debut with a collection of poems titled ''Loomingus''.

In 1936, Merilaas married the Estonian writer and translator [[August Sang]] (1914–1969) and the couple had a son named Joel Sang in 1950 who would go on to become a poet, literary critic, linguist, translator and publicist.<ref name="Kiltsi Põhikool">[http://www.v-maarja.ee/kiltsipk/merilaas.htm Kiltsi Põhikool] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529201318/http://www.v-maarja.ee/kiltsipk/merilaas.htm |date=29 May 2008 }}</ref>

From 1936, Merilaas lived in [[Tartu]], where she was employed as a librarian. She was a member of the influential group of Estonian poets brought together in 1938 by literary scholar [[Ants Oras]] who was greatly influenced by [[T. S. Eliot]]. The small circle of poets became known as ''[[Arbujad]]'' ("Soothsayers") and included [[Heiti Talvik]], [[Paul Viiding]], [[Betti Alver]], [[Uku Masing]] and [[Bernard Kangro]]<ref>[http://www.estlit.ee/?id=947 Elic. ''A Short History of Estonian Literature: Literature in an independent Estonia: 1918–1940'']</ref> That year, her anthology of poetry ''Maantee tuuled'' was published to much critical acclaim, particularly for its lyrical preoccupation with love and nature.<ref name="Kiltsi Põhikool"/> Also in 1938 she joined the [[Estonian Writers' Union]].

After the [[Soviet occupation of Estonia|Soviet occupation]] and annexation of Estonia in 1944, Merilaas' work was viewed by authorities as disreputable and promoting "[[bourgeois nationalism]]". In 1950, Merilaas was forced to resign from the Soviet Writers Association of Estonia.<ref>[http://www.okupatsioon.ee/english/overviews/censorship.html Lotman, Piret. ''Censorship During the Occupation of Estonia.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615130741/http://www.okupatsioon.ee/english/overviews/censorship.html |date=15 June 2008 }}</ref> During this time, Merilaas was allowed to continue writing children's literature. In 1960, after the relaxation of Soviet authorities, Merilaas was again permitted to write literature for adults.

Besides poetry and prose, Merilaas wrote [[libretti]] for three operas by Estonian composer [[Gustav Ernesaks]] and translated [[German language|German]] works of [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Georg Christoph Lichtenberg]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] into the [[Estonian language]].<ref name="Kiltsi Põhikool"/>

Merilaas died in [[Tallinn]], Estonia in 1986 at the age of 72.
