'''Veronica Micle''' (born '''Ana Câmpeanu'''; 22 April 1850 – 3 August 1889) was an [[Austrian Empire|Imperial Austrian]]-born [[Romania]]n poet, whose work was influenced by [[Romanticism]]. She is best known for her love affair with the poet [[Mihai Eminescu]], one of the most important Romanian writers.

==Biography==
Born in Naszód, [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526–1867)|Kingdom of Hungary]] (now [[Năsăud]], [[Bistrița-Năsăud County]], [[Romania]]), Micle was the second child of the shoemaker Ilie Câmpeanu and his wife Ana. She was born to him posthumously: Ilie died in 1849, taking two bullets to the chest while fighting under [[Avram Iancu]] against the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Hungarian revolutionaries]]. Her mother went to [[Moldavia]], settling in [[Târgu Neamț]] in 1850, then to [[Roman, Romania|Roman]], and finally in [[Iași]] in 1853.<ref name="bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.neamt.ro/cmj/memoriale/micle/biografie.html |title=Veronica Micle – biografie|language=ro|access-date=June 14, 2020}}</ref><ref name="obs">{{cite web|first=Elena |last=Buica-Pickering| url=http://www.observatorul.com/articles_main.asp?action=articleviewdetail&ID=1252|title=Veronica Micle (22 aprilie 1850 – 6 august 1889)| newspaper=[[Observatorul Cultural]]|date= 21 April 2004|language=ro|access-date=June 14, 2020}}</ref>

Ana went to primary school (during which time she began using the name Veronica) and to the Iași Central School for Girls, which she graduated in June 1863.<ref name="bio" /><ref name="obs" /> Her graduation exam proctor was the [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] of the [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza University|University of Iași]], Professor [[Ștefan Micle]]. They fell in love and on 7 August 1864, at [[Bob Church, Cluj|Bob Church]], in [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]] (at the time, Kolozsvár), she married Micle, thirty years her senior.<ref name="obs" /> She had two daughters: Virginia, a poet who married Eduard Gruber,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.institutuldefilosofie.ro/e107_files/downloads/CFP/Extrase%20CFP%20nr.%202-2011/Nicolae%20Georgescu%20-%20Eduard%20Gruber%20si%20%20destinele%20eminesciene%20[CFP%20nr.%202-2011].pdf|title=Eduard Gruber și Destine Eminesciene|website=institutuldefilosofie.ro|first=Nicolae|last=Georgescu|language=ro|access-date=June 14, 2020}}</ref> and Valeria, an opera singer who used the name Hilda professionally.<ref name="bio" />

In March 1872, in [[Vienna]], she met Eminescu, beginning a relationship that would last for the rest of their lives.<ref name="obs" /> At first he would visit the literary salon that she hosted. Their friendship had become love sometime between 1875, when they started dedicating poems to each other, and 1878 (sources vary). Their romance went through several ups and downs&mdash;for instance, Eminescu left for [[Bucharest]] in 1877 to edit ''[[Timpul]]'' and that year Micle published poems in which she expressed her sadness at being left behind. Her husband died in 1879, leaving her rather poor. She came to Bucharest to seek a pension and Eminescu publicly called her his fiancée, but further stresses intervened (including a stillborn child in May 1880) and while he took up the subject again in 1881, he was diagnosed with [[syphilis]] in 1883.

In 1887, she moved to [[Bucharest]] in an effort to keep up Eminescu's spirits. After his death in June 1889, she retired to [[Văratec Monastery]], where she put together a volume called ''Dragoste și Poezie'' (''Love and Poetry''), in which she included poems of her own and those of Eminescu dedicated to her, to which she added commentary. A shaken Micle took [[arsenic]] not two months after Eminescu's death.<ref name="obs" /> She is buried on the monastery grounds, in [[Agapia|Văratec]] village. Her house in Târgu Neamț, given to her by her parents as a wedding dowry and which she donated to the monastery in 1886, is now a museum.

==Literary activity==
Micle made her publishing debut in ''Noul Curier Român'' (''NCR'') in 1872, with two romantic sketches published under the pen-name Corina. She published her poems, influenced by Eminescu, in ''Columna Lui Traian'' in 1874 and in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'' the following year. She also contributed to ''[[Familia (literary magazine)|Familia]]'' (from 1879), ''Revista Nouă'' and ''Revista Literară''.

Additionally, a volume containing 93 of Eminescu's letters to Micle and 15 of her replies was published in 2000.
