==Biography==
Hitchcock was born in [[Hood River, Oregon|Hood River]], [[Oregon]], graduating in 1935 from the [[University of Oregon]], where he was a reporter on the school newspaper. After college, he worked as a journalist for several labor movement periodicals, including ''[https://www.marxists.org/history/usa/pubs/westernworker/1933/index.htm The Western Worker]'' and ''The People’s Daily World'', simultaneously developing an interest in poetry which was fostered by [[Kenneth Rexroth]]. He joined the [[United States Merchant Marine]] during [[World War II]], and worked as a cook and a waiter in the South Pacific.<ref name=NYTObit/>

After the war, he became more active in the labor movement, working to organize dairy workers in California and teaching at the [[California Labor School]]. Later, he became active in the [[San Francisco]] theater scene, writing plays and acting with the [[Actor's Workshop]] and the [[Interplayers Theater|Interplayers]] while working as a landscape gardener.<ref name=NYTObit/>

While performing at the [[Oregon Shakespeare Festival]] in 1957, Hitchcock was called to testify before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], where in response to a question asking him his profession, he responded, "I am a gardener. I do underground work on plants". He refused to answer any further questions "on the grounds that this hearing is a big bore and waste of the public's money".<ref name=NYTObit/>

==Magazine publisher==
In 1958, after the ''[[San Francisco Review]]'' published one of Hitchcock's plays, he joined it as an editor. When the organization folded, he founded ''Kayak'' as a response to what he saw as the "tepid eclecticism" of the other literary journals of the day, with the journal's title representing the "small watertight vessel operated by a single oarsman" that was a metaphor for the way he personally ran the publication as a self-titled "dictator".<ref name=LATObit>Woo, Elaine. [http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-george-hitchcock-20100902,0,3051524.story "George Hitchcock dies at 96; poet and publisher of the literary magazine 'kayak': Hitchcock created kayak in 1964, and it quickly gained notice as a bulwark on the literary vanguard. It provided a forum for such writers as Robert Bly, Raymond Carver, W.S. Merwin and Anne Sexton."], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', September 2, 2010. Accessed September 5, 2010.</ref> Hitchcock ran ''Kayak'' frugally as a one-man show from its creation in 1964, using an [[offset printing]] press he had purchased and having personally "designed the magazine, edited it, printed it, illustrated it" and ran parties where the printed sheets would be assembled for mailing.<ref name=NYTObit/>

During his Kayak period in San Francisco, ca. 1967, he was on the adjunct faculty of [[San Francisco State University|San Francisco State]] and taught a lively graduate level playwriting course out of his home on Webster Street—three hours in the evening once a week—where students effectively performed scenes they had written for assignments; often visiting poets like Robert Bly and other Kayak writers dropped in for a cup of coffee and observed quietly from the kitchen.

Hitchcock moved to [[Santa Cruz, California]] in 1970 and joined the faculty of the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], where he taught poetry and playwriting until 1989. In the magazine's 64 issues published before he shut the publication in 1984, ''Kayak'' included many significant poets and writers of prose, such as [[Raymond Carver]], [[Anne Sexton]], [[Robert Bly]], and [[Margaret Atwood]].<ref name="NYTObit" /> [[Howard Junker]], founder and editor of ''[[Zyzzyva (magazine)|Zyzzyva: The Journal of West Coast Writers and Artists]]'', called Hitchcock "the pre-eminent maverick independent magazine publisher".<ref name="NYTObit" />

Hitchcock had co-written a critical satire Pioneers of Modern Poetry with poet [[Robert Peters (playwright)|Robert Peters]] in 1966. It was led to be an experiment in criticism. In these pieces where Hitchcock arranged most of the "poems" from various prose texts, and Peters wrote most of the "interpretations." These ripostes between Hitchcock & Peters were thrust against some of the excesses of Projective Verse poets, their adulators, and academic readings of poems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://openlibrary.org/works/OL2907307W/Pioneers_of_modern_poetry|title=Pioneers of modern poetry (1967 edition) &#124; Open Library}}</ref>
