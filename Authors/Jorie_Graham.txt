About Jorie Graham, Academy of American Poets Chancellor [[Claudia Rankine]] said: "Jorie Graham's masterful poems traverse almost four decades of inquiry into what it means to be in relation. Her work pulls forward our mythical, historical, environmental, and personal narratives in order to inhabit our most ordinary and collective experiences. Hers is the patience of the return; repetition in her work unearths the nuances of fundamental desires to live, to love, to be. Clear-eyed and with a scope that encompasses what is both known and unknown, her 15 collections have built towards a brilliant insistence on presence."<ref name=":0" />

She served as a Chancellor of The [[Academy of American Poets]] from 1997 to 2003.

==Life==
Jorie Graham was born in [[New York City]] in 1950 to [[Curtis Bill Pepper]], a war correspondent and the head of the Rome bureau for ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine, and the sculptor [[Beverly Pepper|Beverly Stoll Pepper]].  She and her brother [[John Randolph Pepper]] were raised in [[Rome]], [[Italy]]. She studied philosophy at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in Paris, but was expelled for participating in student protests. She completed her undergraduate work as a film major at [[New York University]], and became interested in poetry during that time. (She claims that her interest was sparked while walking past M.L. Rosenthal's classroom and overhearing the last couplet of  "[[The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock]]" ). After working as a secretary, she later went on to receive her Master of Fine Arts from the famed [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]] at the [[University of Iowa]].

Graham has held a longtime faculty position at the Iowa Writers' Workshop, and has held an appointment at [[Harvard University]] since 1999. Graham replaced [[Nobel Laureate]] and poet [[Seamus Heaney]] as Boylston professor in Harvard's Department of English and American Literature and Language. She became the first woman to be awarded this position.<ref name="poetryfoundation" /><ref name="orr">David Orr, "ON POETRY; Jorie Graham, Superstar," 'New York Times ''Sunday Book Review,'' April 24, 2005; [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/24/books/review/24ORRL.html available] at the Time website (accessed March 16, 2008)</ref>

Graham was married to and divorced from publishing heir William Graham, brother of [[Donald E. Graham]], the former publisher of ''[[The Washington Post]]''.  She then married the poet [[James Galvin (poet)|James Galvin]] in 1983 and they divorced in 1999. She married poet and painter [[Peter M. Sacks]], in 2000.<ref name="LAtimes">Tomas Alex Tizon, "In Search of Poetic Justice," ''Los Angeles Times'', June 17, 2005.

==Poetry competition controversy==
In January 1999, she judged the [[University of Georgia]] Contemporary Poetry series contest, which selected the manuscript "O Wheel" from Peter Sacks, her future husband, as the first-place winner.  Graham noted that at that time she was not married to Sacks, and that while she had "felt awkward" about giving the award to her then-boyfriend, she had first cleared it with the series editor, Bin Ramke.<ref name="LAtimes"/><ref>Kevin Larimer, "The Contester: Who's Doing What to Keep Them Clean", ''Poets & Writers Magazine,'' July/August 2005.

A statement now adopted in the rules of many competitions (including the University of Georgia Contest) to prevent judges from selecting students is often referred to as the "Jorie Graham rule".<ref name="guardian"/><ref name="globe">Alex Beam, "Website polices rhymes and misdemeanors," ''Boston Globe'', March 31, 2005, [http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2005/03/31/website_polices_rhymes_and_misdemeanors/ available here]</ref><ref name="Foetry-graham">{{Cite web |url=http://foetry.com/wp/?page_id=85 |title=Foetry page on Jorie Graham |access-date=2008-03-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070719050540/http://foetry.com/wp/?page_id=85 |archive-date=2007-07-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The Foetry site also contended that Graham, as a judge at Georgia and other contests, had awarded prizes to at least five of her former students from the Iowa Writers' Workshop, including [[Joshua Clover]], [[Mark Levine (poet)|Mark Levine]], and [[Geoffrey Nutter]].<ref name="Foetry-graham"/>  Graham's reply to this was that over years of teaching she has had over 1400 students, many of whom went on to continue writing poetry, that no rules had prohibited her from awarding prizes to former students, and that in each case she claims to have selected the strongest work.<ref name="LAtimes"/>
