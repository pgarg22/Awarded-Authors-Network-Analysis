'''Peter Anton Orlovsky''' (July 8, 1933 &ndash; May 30, 2010) was an [[American poet]] and [[actor]]. He was the long-time partner of [[Allen Ginsberg]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2021}}

==Early life and career==
Orlovsky was born in the [[Lower East Side]] of New York City, the son of Katherine (née Schwarten) and Oleg Orlovsky, a [[Russians|Russian]] immigrant.<ref name=pard>{{cite book|last=Tytell|first=John|title=Paradise outlaws: remembering the beats|publisher=W. Morrow|year=1999|page=[https://archive.org/details/paradiseoutlawsr00tyte/page/30 30]|url=https://archive.org/details/paradiseoutlawsr00tyte|isbn=0688164439|url-access=registration}}</ref> He was raised in poverty and was forced to drop out of [[Newtown High School (New York City)|Newtown High School]] in his senior year so he could support his impoverished family. After many odd jobs, he began working as an [[orderly]] at Creedmoor State Mental Hospital, known today as [[Creedmoor Psychiatric Center]].

In 1953, Orlovsky was drafted into the [[United States Army]] for the [[Korean War]] at nineteen years old. Army psychiatrists ordered his transfer off the front to work as a medic in a San Francisco hospital. He later went to [[Columbia University]].

He met Allen Ginsberg while working as a model for the painter Robert La Vigne in San Francisco in December 1954. Prior to meeting Ginsberg, Orlovsky had made no deliberate attempts at becoming a poet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/uthrc/00103/hrc-00103.html|title=Peter Orlovsky: An Inventory of His Papers at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center|access-date=2011-02-02|publisher=University of Texas}}</ref> Ginsberg was living with his girlfriend Sheila Williams Boucher at the time, but broke off the relationship to be with Orlovsky. Orlovsky also had a sexual relationship with Boucher during this time. Ginsberg and Orlovsky considered their relationship to be a "marriage sealed by vows." It was an [[open relationship]], in part because Orlovsky was bisexual.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bullough |first=Vern L |date=2014 |title=Before Stonewall: Activists for Gay and Lesbian Rights in Historical Context |publisher=Taylor & Francis |page=307 |isbn=9781317766285}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Orlovsky; Morgan |first=Peter; Bill |date=2016 |title=Peter Orlovsky, a Life in Words: Intimate Chronicles of a Beat Writer |publisher=Paradigm Publishers |page=14 |isbn=9781317254249}}</ref>

With Ginsberg's encouragement, Orlovsky began writing in 1957 while the pair were living in Paris. Accompanied by other beat writers, Orlovsky traveled extensively for several years throughout the Middle East, Northern Africa, India, and Europe.<ref name="latimes"/> He also helped produce and contributed vocals to Ginsberg's 1970 LP ''[[Songs of Innocence and Experience (Allen Ginsberg album)|Songs of Innocence and Experience]]'', based on [[William Blake]]'s [[Songs of Innocence and of Experience|poetry collection of the same name]].<ref name="LP">{{cite AV media notes|author=Anon.|year=1970|title=Songs of Innocence and Experience|others=[[Allen Ginsberg]]/[[William Blake]]|publisher=[[MGM Records]]/[[Verve Forecast]]|id=FTS3083/MGS2112|type=LP record}}</ref> Orlovsky was Ginsberg's lover in an open relationship until Ginsberg's death in 1997.<ref name="latimes">{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/jacketcopy/2010/05/peter-orlovsky-poet-and-partner-to-allen-ginsberg-has-died.html |title=Peter Orlovsky, poet and partner of Allen Ginsberg, has died |publisher=Latimesblogs.latimes.com |date= May 31, 2010|access-date=2010-06-03}}</ref>

In 1974, Orlovsky joined the faculty of the [[Jack Kerouac School|Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics]] at the [[Naropa University|Naropa Institute]] in [[Boulder, Colorado]], teaching poetry. In 1979 he received a $10,000 grant from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] to continue his creative endeavors.

==Death==
In May 2010, friends reported that Orlovsky, who had had [[lung cancer]] for several months, was moved from his home in [[St. Johnsbury, Vermont]], to the Vermont Respite House in [[Williston, Vermont|Williston]]. He died there on May 30, 2010, from complications of the disease; he was 76 years old. He was buried at [[Shambhala Mountain Center]] in [[Red Feather Lakes, Colorado]]. His epitaph reads: "Train will tug my grave, my breathe hueing gentil vapor between weel & track".
