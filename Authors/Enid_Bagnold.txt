==Early life==

During the [[First World War]] she became a nurse; she wrote critically of the hospital administration, and was dismissed as a result. After that she was a driver in [[France]] for the remainder of the war years. She wrote about her hospital experiences in ''A Diary Without Dates'',<ref>[https://archive.org/details/diarywithoutdate00bagn ''A Diary Without Dates'']</ref> and about her experiences as a driver in ''The Happy Foreigner''.<ref>[http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/bagnold/happy/happy.html ''The Happy Foreigner'']</ref><ref>[http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women Profile: "A Celebration of Women Writers"], upenn.edu; accessed 28 September 2014.</ref>

In 1920, she married Sir [[Roderick Jones (journalist)|Roderick Jones]], chairman of [[Reuters]], but continued to use her maiden name for her writing. They lived at North End House, [[Rottingdean]], near [[Brighton]] (previously the home of Sir [[Edward Burne-Jones]]), the garden of which inspired her play ''[[The Chalk Garden]]''. The Joneses' London house from 1928 until 1969, seven years after Sir Roderick's death, was No. 29 [[Hyde Park Gate]], which meant that they were the neighbours for many of those years of [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Jacob Epstein]].

The couple had four children. The eldest was [[Laurian Jones|Laurian]], who illustrated two of Bagnold's books at a tender{{quantify|date=November 2021}} age.
