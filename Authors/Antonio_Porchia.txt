'''Antonio Porchia''' (November 13, 1885 – November 9, 1968) was an [[Argentinian]] [[poetry|poet]]. He was born in [[Conflenti]], [[Italy]], but, after the death of his father in 1900, moved to [[Argentina]]. He wrote a Spanish book entitled ''Voces'' ("Voices"), a book of [[aphorism]]s. It has since been translated into Italian and into English (by [[W.S. Merwin]], [[Copper Canyon Press]], 2003), French, and German. A very influential, yet extremely succinct writer, he has been a [[cult fiction|cult author]] for a number of renowned figures of contemporary literature and thought such as [[André Breton]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Don Paterson]], [[Roberto Juarroz]] and [[Henry Miller]], amongst others. Some critics have paralleled his work to Japanese [[haiku]] and found many similarities with a number of [[Zen]] schools of thought.
