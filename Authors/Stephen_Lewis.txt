'''Stephen Henry Lewis''' {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|CC}} (born November 11, 1937) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] politician, public speaker, broadcaster and [[diplomacy|diplomat]]. He was the leader of the [[social democracy|social democratic]] [[Ontario New Democratic Party]] for most of the 1970s.

During many of those years as leader, his father [[David Lewis (Canadian politician)|David Lewis]] was simultaneously the leader of the federal [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]]. After politics, he became a broadcaster on both [[CBC Radio]] and Toronto's [[Citytv]]. In the mid-1980s, he was appointed as Canada's [[United Nations]] ambassador, by Progressive Conservative Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]]. He quit in 1988 and worked at various United Nations agencies during the 1990s. In the 2000s, he served a term as the United Nations' [[special envoy]] for [[HIV/AIDS in Africa]]. In 2003, he gained investiture into the [[Order of Canada]]. As of 2014, he is a Distinguished Visiting Professor at [[Ryerson University]] in [[Toronto]].

==Early life and education==
Stephen Lewis was born in [[Ottawa, Ontario]], on November 11, 1937, to Sophie Lewis (née Carson) and [[David Lewis (Canadian politician)|David Lewis]].<ref name ="Smith, p. 258">Smith, p.258</ref> His parents gave him the Hebrew name "Sholem", a [[Yiddish]] derivation of the Hebrew word ''shalom'', which means peace, because he was born on [[Armistice Day]].<ref name ="Smith, p. 330">Smith, p.330</ref> From the time he was born, and through his early childhood, his father was the National Secretary of the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (CCF), the predecessor party to the NDP.<ref name ="Age question">{{Cite news | last = Frayne | first = Trent | title =David Lewis has it all to win NDP leadership except for his age: 61 | newspaper = [[The Toronto Star]] | location = Toronto | page = 11  | date = 1971-04-17}}</ref> When his family moved to [[Toronto]] in 1950, he attended  secondary school first at Toronto's [[Oakwood Collegiate Institute]], and then his final three years of high school at [[Harbord Collegiate Institute]].<ref name ="Smith, p.338">Smith, p.338</ref>  In 1956, he entered the [[University of Toronto]] (UofT) where he became a member of the [[Hart House (University of Toronto)|Hart House]] debating committee, and on 14 November 1957, debated the senator and future American president, [[John F. Kennedy]], on the question, "Has the United States failed in its responsibilities as a world leader?"<ref name ="Smith, pp. 382-383">Smith, p.382-383</ref><ref name="The Varsity">{{Cite news | newspaper = The Varsity | location = Toronto | publisher = University of Toronto | date = 1957-11-15}}</ref> The Senator narrowly beat the Hart House team 204-194.<ref name ="Kennedy">{{Cite news | title = U.S. Senator Sees Mideast Strife | newspaper = [[The Globe and Mail]]  |location = Toronto | page = 4 | date = 1957-11-15}}</ref> Lewis's performance was considered the highlight of the event, while Kennedy's was flat according to many members in the audience like [[John Brewin]].<ref name ="Smith, pp. 382-383"/> He spent his third year of university at the [[University of British Columbia]] (UBC) before spending his final undergraduate year back at UofT where he failed to write his final examinations.<ref name ="Smith, p. 365-366">Smith, pp.365-366</ref>  He went to law school twice in the early 1960s, dropping out of both UofT and UBC's programs.<ref name ="Smith, p. 365-366"/>

==Political career==
He left his studies in the 1960s and took up a clerical position with the [[Socialist International]], where he received an invitation to a conference in Ghana. He attended, and instead of returning to Canada, spent more than a year working, traveling, and teaching in various places in Africa. He recalled in his 2005 [[Massey Lectures]] that the relatively brief sojourn would be a key influence on his life, especially after the turn of the new millennium.

He came back to Canada at the instigation of [[Tommy Douglas]], and in 1963, at the age of 26, he was elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]]. Following the engineered 1970 resignation of [[Donald C. MacDonald]],<ref>MacDonald, pp. 151-152</ref> Lewis was elected leader of the [[Ontario New Democratic Party]]. His initial experience at the helm in the [[1971 Ontario general election|1971 provincial election]] was a disappointment, with the party slipping from 20 seats to 19.

A radical left wing group nicknamed [[The Waffle]] had gained prominence, with one of its leaders, [[James Laxer]], winning one-third of the vote when he ran to be leader of the federal NDP in 1971. Lewis felt that The Waffle was threatening the credibility and stability of the party and supported a movement against the group in June 1972 on the basis that it was a ''party within a party''.<ref name="waffle ends">McLeod & McLeod, pp.360-362</ref>

Lewis led a strong campaign during the [[1975 Ontario general election|1975 election]] with his oratory and passion bringing new supporters to the party. The NDP highlighted issues such as rent control and workplace safety. Each day, Lewis told the story of a different Ontarian in trouble, making a case that this was because of the lack of adequate legislation. Polls showed the NDP surging and the incumbent [[Ontario Progressive Conservative Party]] in freefall and in the course of the campaign [[Premier (Canada)|Premier]] [[Bill Davis|William Davis]] was forced to commit his party to bringing in [[rent control]] and other progressive reforms in order to retain power. When the ballots were counted the Tories were reduced to a [[minority government]]. Lewis' NDP had doubled its seats from 19 to 38, surpassing the [[Ontario Liberal Party]] to become the [[Official Opposition]]. To some it appeared that it was only a matter of time before the NDP would form the government.

The next election, in [[1977 Ontario general election|1977]], proved to be a disappointment. The growth of support for the NDP stalled, and while the Tories were kept to a minority, the NDP failed to make any gains. The party was reduced to 33 seats and lost its status as Official Opposition to the Liberals. In 1978, a frustrated Lewis stepped down as party leader and as a [[Member of Provincial Parliament (Ontario)|Member of Provincial Parliament]].

After leaving politics, Lewis served as an arbitrator with the [[Ministry of Labour (Ontario)|Ontario Ministry of Labour]] and was a commentator on TV station [[CITY-TV]]'s [[CityNews|CityPulse News]] and [[CHKT|CKEY radio]] in Toronto and appeared nationally with [[Dalton Camp]] and [[Eric Kierans]] as part of a weekly political panel on [[Peter Gzowski]]'s [[CBC Radio One|CBC Radio]] show, ''[[Morningside (radio program)|Morningside]]''. He would return to the ''Morningside'' panel in the late 1980s. In 1982, Lewis won the [[Gordon Sinclair Award]] from [[ACTRA]] for his commentary on CKEY.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Patranik |first1=Steven |title=Barbara Frum, four times a winner of major Canadian... |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/05/07/Barbara-Frum-four-times-a-winner-of-major-Canadian/2803389592000/ |access-date=August 23, 2020 |work=United Press International |date=May 7, 1982}}</ref><ref>https://www.library.ubc.ca/archives/hdcites/hdcites9.html {{Bare URL inline|date=June 2021}}</ref>

==Diplomatic and academic career==
[[Image:Stephen-Lewis 2006-01-30.jpg|thumb|250 px|Stephen Lewis, speaking at the [[University of Alberta]], January 30, 2006]]

After working for several years as a labour mediator, columnist and broadcaster, in 1984 Lewis was appointed [[Permanent Representative of Canada to the United Nations]] by [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Jeanne Sauvé]], on the advice of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Brian Mulroney]]. Lewis served at the post until 1988.

From 1995 to 1999, Lewis was Deputy Director of [[UNICEF]]. From 2001 until 2006, he worked as United Nations [[UN Special Envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa]]. In this role, he drew attention to the HIV/AIDS crisis and convinced leaders and the public that they have a responsibility to respond. He has been widely praised for his effectiveness in this role. In 2005 he adapted his [[Massey Lectures]] in a book titled "[[Race Against Time (Lewis)|Race Against Time]]", where he describes the disjuncture between what the international community promises and their actions in responding to the pandemic in Africa.

In May 2006, Lewis joined the Faculty of Social Sciences at [[McMaster University]] as a Scholar-in-Residence.<ref>{{Cite news | last = Christmas | first = Jane | title = Stephen Lewis to join McMaster faculty: Named University's first Social Sciences Scholar-in-Residence | newspaper = McMaster Daily News | location = [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], Canada | publisher = [[McMaster University]] | date = 2006-05-04 | url = http://dailynews.mcmaster.ca/story.cfm?id=3989 | access-date = 2014-04-03 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110727094725/http://dailynews.mcmaster.ca/story.cfm?id=3989 | archive-date = 2011-07-27 | url-status = dead }}</ref> Also in 2006, he was elected a Senior Fellow of [[Massey College]] in the University of Toronto. In 2009, Lewis strongly criticized [[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s assertion that condom use only makes the AIDS crisis worse.<ref>{{Cite news | last = Ward | first =  Olivia | title = Pope's condom remarks 'real tragedy' | newspaper = [[The Toronto Star]] | pages =  A8 | date = 2009-03-18}}</ref>

==Stephen Lewis Foundation==
Lewis is chair of the board of the Stephen Lewis Foundation, a non-profit organization that helps people affected and infected by [[HIV/AIDS]] in Africa.<ref name="Stephen Lewis Foundation">{{cite web |url=http://stephenlewisfoundation.org/who-we-are/about-stephen-lewis |publisher=Stephen Lewis Foundation |title=About Stephen Lewis |access-date=2014-04-03}}</ref>

In October 2009, to raise money for the foundation, Lewis helped with a campaign to dare Canadians to do something for Africa called A Dare to Remember.<ref name="dare">{{Cite news | last = Wiebe | first = Lindsey | title = Raise money for AIDS by going out on a limb | newspaper = [[Winnipeg Free Press]] | location = Winnipeg | page = C7 | publisher =  FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership | date = 2009-09-01 | url = http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/entertainment/raise-money-for-aids-by-going-out-on-a-limb-56534832.html | access-date = 2014-04-03}}</ref> The campaign saw Lewis, along with musician [[k-os]], [[Federal NDP]] leader [[Jack Layton]], Olympic gold medalist [[Duff Gibson]] and many other [[Canadians]], performing various [[:wikt:dare|dares]] for the event.<ref name="dare"/>  He faced his own personal fears as part of the campaign, and sang live on [[The Hour (Canadian TV series)|CBC's The Hour]] with the band [[Arkells|the Arkells.]]

==AIDS-Free World==
In 2007, Stephen Lewis and long-time colleague [[Paula Donovan]] co-founded ''AIDS-Free World'', a non-profit organization that advocates for more effective global responses to HIV and AIDS.<ref name="AIDS-Free World">{{cite web |url=http://www.aidsfreeworld.org/About-Us.aspx AIDS-Free World |title=About Us |publisher=AIDS-Free World |access-date=2014-04-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306150002/http://www.aidsfreeworld.org/About-Us.aspx |archive-date=2014-03-06 }}</ref>

As a [[AIDS#Prevention|preventative HIV/AIDS strategy]], Lewis has made a somewhat controversial call for [[male circumcision]] when African boys receive the first of two UN-administered [[measles vaccine|measles vaccination]] shots, so that their recovery progress can be monitored at the time of the second vaccination.<ref name="circumcision">{{Cite web | last = Lewis | first = Stephen | title = Male Circumcision Part 1 | work = AIDS Free World | publisher = [[YouTube]] | date = 2010-01-06  | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kIqB_6KRg | format = online video | access-date = 2014-04-03}}</ref>  Many studies have been conducted into [[Circumcision and HIV|the role circumcision can play]] in reducing the spread of HIV.
