'''Dživo Franov Gundulić''' ({{lang-it|Gianfrancesco Gondola}}; 8 January 1589 – 8 December 1638), better known today as '''Ivan Gundulić''', was the most prominent [[Baroque literature|Baroque]] poet from the [[Republic of Ragusa]] (now in [[Croatia]]).<ref>Gordana P.

Gundulić's major works&mdash;the [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] ''Osman'', the [[pastoral]] play ''[[Dubravka (drama)|Dubravka]]'', and the religious [[Poetry|poem]] ''[[Tears of the Prodigal Son]]'' (based on the [[Parable of the Prodigal Son]]) are examples of Baroque stylistic richness and, frequently, rhetorical excess.

==Life and works==
Gundulić was born in [[Dubrovnik]] into a wealthy Ragusan noble family (''see'' [[House of Gundulić]]) on 8 January 1589. Son of Francesco di Francesco Gundulić (Frano Franov Gundulić, senator and diplomat, once the Ragusan envoy to Constantinople and councilor of the Republic to the Pope Gregory VIII) and Dživa Gradić (de Gradi). He received an excellent education. He probably studied the humanities with the Jesuit [[Silvestro Muzio]] and philosophy with [[Ridolfo Ricasoli]] and [[Camillo Camilli]] (*Siena -+1615),<ref>F.M.Appendini, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=j2kAAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA10-IA2&lpg=PA10-IA2&dq=silvestro+muzio&source=bl&ots=aGeQN7Qorx&sig=ZeJaaKsOrojT8svmjsxTybiPddk&hl=it&ei=LlbHSZaCK-TCjAe24fGUCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=3&ct=result Versione libera dell'Osmanide]'', Per Antonio Martecchini, Ragusa 1827</ref> who in late 1590 had been appointed ''rettore delle scuole e professore di umane lettere'' in Ragusa. After that he studied Roman law and jurisprudence in general, where he held numerous offices for the Great Council of the Republic. In 1608, when he was nineteen, he became a member of the Veliko vieće (Great Council).  Twice, in 1615 and 1619, he held the temporary function of knez (commissary or governor) of Konavle, an area southeast of the city.

At the age of thirty he married with Nicoleta Sorkočević (Sorgo)(+1644) who bore him three sons, Frano (Francesco), Mato (Matheo), Šišmundo "Šiško" (Segismondo) and two daughters, Marija "Mare" (Maria) Gondola and Dživa (Giovanna). [[Fran Dživa Gundulić]] and [[Mato Gundulić]] (1636–1684) fought in the thirty-years war under [[Wallenstein]]; the youngest died on January 16, 1682, being by then the Rector of the Republic. From 1621 until his death Ivan held various offices in the city government. In 1636 he became a senator, in 1637 a judge, and in 1638 a member of the Small Council (''Malo vieće''). Had he lived a little longer – he died of an intense fever, product of an inflammation in his ribs ( ''Folio 15 Libr. Mort. N°274, Adi le Xbre 1638 Ragusa'') – he would probably have been elected ''knez'' (rector) of the Dubrovnik Republic, the highest function that was held for one month only by meritorious gentlemen at least fifty years old. His father, who died in 1624, had been ''knez'' five times, and Ivan's son [[Šišmundo Gundulić]] later four times. Ivan Gundulić was buried in the [[Franciscan church and monastery (Dubrovnik)|Franciscan church]] of Dubrovnik.
[[File:Dubrovnik (76).JPG|thumb|250px|Tomb of Ivan Gundulić in the Franciscan church, Dubrovnik, where his name is spelled as Dživo Franov Gundulić (in dative case, meaning: John, Francis' son, Gundulić)]]
He began his literary career by writing poems and staging melodramas that became popular in Dubrovnik. But Ivan published only his larger works. His earlier work, which he referred to as a "brood of darkness", is now lost. His first publications were in 1621, when he rewrote several of David's Psalms and wrote several religious poems. He then wrote his famous ''Suze sina razmetnoga'' ([[Tears of the Prodigal Son]]) in 1622, composed of three "Cries": ''Sagriešenje'' (Sin), ''Spoznanje'' (Insight) and ''Skrušenje'' (Humility). In this poem Ivan presented the three basic categories of [[Christianity|Christian faith]]: sin, repentance and redemption through contrasts such as between life and death, purity and sin, and Heaven and Hell. In 1637 when [[Ferdinand II of Tuscany]] married, Gundulić wrote a poem to honor the event, he noted that ''"all of Slavic people (Slovinski narod) honor you on this occasion"''.

===''Dubravka''===
Gundulić's most famous play is ''[[Dubravka (drama)|Dubravka]]'', a [[pastoral]] written in 1628, where he rhapsodises on the former glory of Dubrovnik and contains some of the most famous verses in [[Croatian literature]]:

{{col-begin}}

'''[[Croatian language|Croatian]]'''

<poem>
       O liepa, o draga, o slatka slobodo,
dar u kom sva blaga višnji nam Bog je dô,
   uzroče istini od naše sve slave,
uresu jedini od ove Dubrave,
   sva srebra, sva zlata, svi ljudcki životi
ne mogu bit plata tvôj čistoj lipoti.

</poem>
{{col-2}}
'''English'''

<poem>
    Fair liberty, beloved liberty, liberty sweetly avowed,
thou are the treasured gift that God to us endowed,
   all our glory is thy true creation,
to our Home thou are all the decoration,
   no silver nor gold, not life itself could replace
the reward of thy pure and sublime grace.
</poem>
{{col-end}}

===''Osman''===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}
In his greatest work, ''Osman'', Gundulić presents the contrasts between Christianity and Islam, Europe and the Turks, West and East, and what he viewed as freedom and slavery. ''Osman'' had 20 cantos, but the 14th and the 15th were never found. Judging from the modern perspective, two approaches seem to dominate the contemporary appraisal of Gundulić's poetry: on one hand, his poetic influence has dimmed due to a change in aesthetic sensibility (Gundulić's chief literary predecessor and influence, [[Torquato Tasso]], has undergone similar reassessment, but his artistic integrity and individuality have withstood the test of time better); while Gundulić's impact in the final standardisation of [[Croatian language|Croatian]] was overwhelming.
[[File:Dubrovnik (45).JPG|thumb|Bronze relief on the statue of Ivan Gundulić in Dubrovnik, showing a scene from the ninth canto where Sunčanica is taken to the Sultan's harem]]

''Osman'' is firmly rooted within the rich literary tradition of the Croatian [[Baroque]] in Dubrovnik and [[Dalmatia]] and is considered as one of its apogees. By presenting the contrast of struggle between Christianity and Islam, Gundulić continued [[Marko Marulić]]'s glorification of the fights against the invading [[Ottoman Turks]]. Besides magnifying Slavdom and the battles against the conquerors, Gundulić described the life of the Ottoman sultan [[Osman II]]. Gundulić constantly reminds the reader of the ''wheel of fortune'' and how the world is transient.

''Osman'' begins with the Sultan's grasping of the situation caused by the 1621 Ottoman [[Battle of Khotyn (1621)|defeat at Chocim]] and descriptions of how the era of pre-Ottoman glory of the Bulgarians, Serbs, Hungarians, Albanians and especially the Poles could be easily restored. According to the storyline, Sultan Osman dispatched Ali-pasha to the [[History of Poland|Kingdom of Poland]] in order to negotiate peace and Kazlar-aga to choose which Polish noblewoman would suit him best for marriage. Gundulić describes the travels of both Ali-pasha and Kazlar-aga while paying much attention to the battle of Chocim and the enslaved Slavs that suffer under Ottoman rule. After numerous failed attempts to restore order in the empire, the army captures Osman and executes him, bringing the imprisoned Mustafa as the new sultan.

[[Image:Gundulićev san.jpg|thumb|300px|right|''Gundulić's Dream'' by [[Vlaho Bukovac]]]]
Osman was printed for the first time in Dubrovnik in 1826, with the two missing cantos being replaced by poems written by the poet [[Petar Ignjat Sorkočević-Crijević]] (1749–1826), a direct descendant of Ivan Gundulić (his maternal grandmother Nikoleta Gundulić was Šišmundo Gundulić's daughter). Another descendant, Baron [[Vlaho Getaldić]] (grandson of Katarina Gundulić) introduced a hexameter treaty into ''Osman'' in 1865. ''Osman'' was not published in the integral edition until 1844, when the [[Illyrian movement]] chose Gundulić's oeuvre as a role model of [[Croatian language|Croatian]]. One of the leading Illyrists' men of letters, politician, linguist and poet [[Ivan Mažuranić]], successfully completed Gundulić's ''Osman'' by composing the last two chapters, which were left unfinished upon the poet's death.
[[File:Ivan Gundulić - monument in Dubrovnik.jpg|thumb|Monument to Ivan Gundulić in Dubrovnik]]
The monument to Gundulić by the sculptor [[Ivan Rendić]] was [[Unveiling of the Gundulić monument|unveiled]] on 25 July 1893 in Dubrovnik's largest square, Poljana.

At a charity concert held for the children of war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina in September 1995, [[Bono]] recited at the end of the song [[Miss Sarajevo]] the famous Ivan Gundulić verses: ”O liepa, o draga, o slatka slobodo” (“Oh beautiful, oh precious, oh sweet Liberty”).

</ref> According to Marie-Janine Calic, professor of History at [[Ludwig Maximilian University]], following the [[Counter-reformation]], a new symbiosis arose between the reformed Catholicism and the (re-)emerging Croatian identity, that undoubtedly influenced the local Baroque art. Thus, this reformed Catholicism was one of the most important factors for developing a separate Croatian ethnic consciousness and Gundulić's poem Osman was expression of distinct Croatian (pre-)national feelings.<ref>Marie-Janine Calic, The Great Cauldron: A History of Southeastern Europe, Harvard University Press, 2019, {{ISBN|0674983920}}, p. 95.</ref> According to Slobodan Drakulić, professor of sociology at [[Ryerson University]], the modern Croatian nationalism has as its antecedent  a pre-modern Croatian nationalism, which was a 16-17th cent. indigenous social phenomenon, and one of its representatives was Gundulić.<ref>Slobodan Drakulic (2008) Premodern Croatian Nationalism?, in "Nationalism and Ethnic Politics," 14:4, 523-548, DOI: 10.1080/13537110802473308.</ref>

On the other hand, Gundulić's ethnicity is part of the Serb-Croat distinctions in self-identification of the Western South Slavic enlighteners, that was one of the major problems in 20th. century Yugoslavia.<ref>Zlatko Isaković, Identity and Security in Former Yugoslavia, Routledge Revivals, Edition reprint, Routledge, 2019, {{ISBN|1351733508}}, p. 59.</ref>
