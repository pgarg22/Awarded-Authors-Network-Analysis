'''Jack Whyte''' (March 15, 1940{{spnd}}February 22, 2021) was a Scottish-Canadian [[novelist]] of [[historical fiction]]. Born and raised in Scotland, he moved to Canada in 1967. He resided in [[Kelowna]], [[British Columbia]].

==Writings==
Whyte's major work was a series of [[historical novel]]s retelling the story of [[King Arthur]] against the backdrop of [[Roman Britain]]. This version of the popular legend eschews the use of magic to explain Arthur's ascent to power and instead relies on the historical condition (with some artistic licence) of post-Roman Britain to support the theory that Arthur was meant to counter the anarchy left by the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|Roman departure from Britain]] in 410 AD and the subsequent colonization and invasion of Britain by various peoples from Northwestern Europe, including the [[Saxons]], [[Jutes]], [[Franks]], and [[Angles]]. Whyte incorporates traditional Arthurian names, places and events (albeit in Gaelic or Latin form) as well as the names of various historical figures that have been suggested as being the possible basis for the original King Arthur legend. The tacit implication is that Whyte's version of history is the true story that has become distorted over time to become the legend and stories of magic that we know today. The series has been published in different locations under three different titles. In Canada it was titled ''A Dream of Eagles'', while in the [[United States]] it was retitled ''The [[Camelot#Etymology|Camulod]] Chronicles''.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V6OEz0lNgiAC|title=Jack Whyte: Forty Years in Canada|publisher=Heritage House Publishing Co|date=February 1, 2011|last=Whyte|first=Jack|isbn=9781926936758}}</ref>  When it was eventually republished in [[Great Britain]] with a different reading order, it became ''Legends of Camelot''.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z65cCwAAQBAJ|title=The Eagle: The Concluding Volume of The Camulod Chronicles|publisher=Tom Doherty Associates|date=February 2, 2016|last=Whyte|first=Jack|isbn=9781466833678}}</ref>
