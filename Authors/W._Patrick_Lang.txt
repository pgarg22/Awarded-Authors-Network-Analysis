After leaving uniformed military service as a [[colonel]], he held high-level posts in [[military intelligence]] as a civilian.  He led intelligence analysis of the Middle East and [[South Asia]] for the [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]] and world-wide [[HUMINT]] activities in a high-level equivalent to the rank of a [[Lieutenant general (United States)|lieutenant general]].

==Background==
Lang graduated from the [[Virginia Military Institute]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in English and from the [[University of Utah]] with an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in Middle East Studies. He is a member of [[Phi Kappa Phi]].

==Personal life==

His uncle is [[John H. Lang]], who served in both [[World Wars]] and during the interwar period, with [[Canadian military|Canadian]] and U.S. military forces.  He received military honors for his actions and bravery from the United Kingdom, United States and Japan.

==Military service==
While serving in the US Army, Lang graduated from the [[U.S. Army War College]], the U.S. Army [[Command and General Staff College]] and the [[Armed Forces Staff College]].  He is a decorated veteran of several of the United States' overseas conflicts. During the [[Vietnam War]], he served in the [[United States Army Special Forces|U.S. Army Special Forces]] and Military Intelligence.<ref>[http://democrats.senate.gov/dpc/hearings/hearing23/transcript.pdf democrats.senate.gov transcript]</ref>

He was trained and educated as a specialist in the [[Middle East]] and served in that region for many years. He was the first professor of [[Arabic]] at the [[United States Military Academy]], where he was twice selected as best classroom teacher of the year.<ref>[http://democrats.senate.gov/dpc/hearings/hearing23/transcript.pdf democrats.senate.gov transcript]</ref>

At the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]], he was the [[defense intelligence officer]] (DIO) for the Middle East, South Asia and counter-terrorism, and later, the first director of the [[Defense Humint Service]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Commanders |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780671769604|url-access=registration|author=Bob Woodward|author-link=Bob Woodward|isbn=0-671-41367-8|year=1991}}</ref> At the DIA, he was a member of the Defense [[Senior Executive Service]]. He participated in the drafting of [[National Intelligence Estimate]]s. From 1992 to 1994, all the U.S. military attachés worldwide reported to him.

==Post-retirement activities==
After leaving government service, he joined [[Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity]], but left that group over policy differences.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}  For a period prior to and during the [[Iraq War]], he registered under the U.S. [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]'s [[Foreign Agents Registration Act]], for his work on behalf of a Lebanese politician and industrialist. He promoted the peace process, vocational training for the building trades, English and French-language instruction, and extending [[microcredit]]. He registered on advice of counsel and has since deregistered.

Continuing his work on the peace process, he participated in work of the [[Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation]]. As an example: [http://www.hfg.org/ar/Imagining%20the%20Next%20War.pdf ''Imagining the Next War'']. The foundation sponsors individuals for "scholarly research on violence, aggression, and dominance." In 2006, Lang was appointed to the foundation's board of directors.
Lang edits a personal [[blog]] [https://turcopolier.com// ''Sic Semper Tyrannis''] on the subjects of intelligence gathering and analysis, military affairs, and war and peace.

== Selected writings ==
Since his retirement from the US Army, Lang has published many articles on intelligence, special operations and the Islamic World.  
*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090609172955/http://www.mepc.org/journal_vol11/0406_lang.asp "Drinking the Koolaid"], ''Middle East Policy Journal'', August 2004. In 2004, he wrote that members of the Bush Administration manipulated intelligence analysis to strengthen the case for the invasion of Iraq in 2003.

Lang has written and discussed the [[2006 Lebanon War]], in which he described the [[Hezbollah]] defense as a defensive belt which he called the "Tabouleh Line". In an interview with Helena Cobban, he said:

<blockquote>A basic lesson of history is that one must win on the battlefield to dictate the peace. A proof of winning on the battlefield has always been possession of that battlefield when the shooting stops. Those who remain on the field are just about always believed to have been victorious. Those who leave the field are believed to be the defeated.<ref>[http://justworldnews.org/archives/002143.html 'Just World News' with Helena Cobban: Lebanese war; post-war; role of UNIFIL<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref></blockquote>

===Iraq and the Middle East===
In 2006, Lang said that he thought an American attack on [[Iran]] would have deadly repercussions on U.S. occupation troops in Iraq. He noted that "troops all over central and northern Iraq are supplied with fuel, food, and ammunition by truck convoy from a supply base hundreds of miles away in Kuwait. All but a small amount of our soldiers' supplies come into the country over roads that pass through the Shiite-dominated south of Iraq." Iraqi Shiia could easily interdict these supplies, not easily replaced by air, once hostilities start.<ref>[http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0721/p09s01-coop.html "The vulnerable line of supply to US troops in Iraq"], ''Christian Science Monitor'', 21 July 2006</ref>

===Conflict with Iran===
In an interview in 2007, he stated that "the U.S. has no plans to bomb Iran," to mean that intensive planning is at an advanced stage but no final decision has been made to push the button. He said the forces are largely in place. The bombing could be carried out by naval air from the [[aircraft carriers]] in place, missiles from the screening ships of the carrier groups, and air force assets. He said there is dissent in the U.S. administration at high levels whether to bomb Iran, and it is possible for high level resignations to occur even in the uniformed services. He said the concentration of forces has a dual purpose, to prod Iran toward serious negotiations and to be there as a resort if negotiations fail.<ref>[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0702/28/sitroom.03.html "Interview, W. Patrick Lang"], CNN,</ref>

===Memoir===

In December 2020, Lang published his memoir under the title TATTOO--A Memoir of Becoming.  It was published by I-Universe.  The 406-page autobiography offers a first-hand account of some of the most important events of the 20th century, starting with his uncle John Lang's Navy service in China during the pre-World War II period, his father's Army service in the Philippines and Germany, and Lang's own lengthy career after graduating from Virginia Military Institute, first in Army Special Forces, later in Military Intelligence and the Defense Intelligence Agency.  Lang's account of his two tours of duty in Vietnam are vivid and capture the agony of that conflict from both a personal and strategic standpoint.  His accounts of his service in the Middle East as a special advisor to the Iraqi Armed Forces during the Iran-Iraq War, as Military Attache in Yemen and Saudi Arabia, and his other special missions in the region is equally gripping and full of personal insights into U.S. policy.

===Historical fiction===
Based on his experience in the military and military intelligence and a lifelong interest in the American Civil War, Patrick Lang wrote three novels set in the American Civil War. The trilogy is called: "Strike The Tent: A Tale Of The Confederate Secret Services". His main character is Confederate agent Claude Devereux around whom the historical events unfold.

The first volume, ''The Butchers Cleaver'', was published in 2007. In this book Claude Devereux, who like his whole family in Alexandria does neither support slavery nor secession, is forced by events into his role as Confederate agent.

The second volume, ''Death Piled Hard'', was published in 2009. Devereux's brother Patrick is killed at Gettysburg. But there is not much time to mourn for Claude Devereux, who is slowly finding his way into command circles behind enemy lines.

The third volume, ''Down the Skies','' was published in 2012. Confederate spy Devereux, by now Brigadier General of the Volunteer Union Forces, not only gained the confidence of president Lincoln but is also getting deeper and deeper insights into the whole administration. But he is suspected of disloyalty, and the Union's Counter-intelligence is on high alert.
