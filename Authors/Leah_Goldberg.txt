'''Leah Goldberg''' or '''Lea Goldberg'''<ref>When filling out a questionnaire for the [[Hebrew Writers Association in Israel]], Goldberg wrote her name also in Latin letters and stated: "Lea, and not Leah". https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/he/d/da/Goldberg3.JPG</ref> ({{lang-he|לאה גולדברג}}; May 29, 1911, [[Königsberg]] – January 15, 1970, [[Jerusalem]]) was a prolific [[Hebrew language|Hebrew-language]] poet, author, playwright, literary translator, and [[Comparative literature|comparative literary]] researcher. 

Her writings are considered classics of [[Israeli literature]].

==Biography==
Leah Goldberg was born to a [[Lithuanian Jews|Jewish Lithuanian]] family from [[Kaunas]], however her mother traveled to the nearby German city of [[Königsberg]] (today, Russian [[Kaliningrad]]) in order to give birth in better medical conditions. When asked about her place of birth, Goldberg often stated "Kaunas" rather than Königsberg.

When the [[First World War]] broke out, three-year-old Goldberg had to escape with her parents to the [[Russian Empire]], where they spent a year in hard conditions. In Russia, her mother gave birth to a baby boy, Immanuel, who died before reaching his first birthday.

According to Goldberg's autobiographical account, in 1938, when the family traveled back to Kaunas in 1919, a Lithuanian border patrol stopped them and accused her father of being a "[[Bolshevik]] spy". They locked the father in a nearby abandoned stable, and abused him by preparing his execution every morning for about a week and cancelling it at the last moment.<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/culture/.premium-1.713236 Life's no fairy tale: Why You Should Be Reading Your Kids Stories of Tragedy]</ref> When the border guards finally let the family go, Goldberg's father was in a serious mental state.<ref>[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Goldberg_Leah  Leah Goldberg, YIVO]</ref> He eventually lost his ability to function normally and left Kaunas and his family to receive treatment, though it is unclear what his fate was and why he never returned to his family. Goldberg and her mother became very close and lived together until Leah Goldberg's death.

Goldberg's parents spoke several languages, though Hebrew was not one of them. However, Goldberg learned [[Hebrew]] at a very young age, as she received her elementary education in a Jewish Hebrew-language school. She began keeping a diary in Hebrew when she was 10 years old. Her first diaries still show limited fluency in Hebrew and the influence of Russian language, but she was determined to write in Hebrew and mastered the language within a short period of time.<ref name="book">Leah Goldberg's Diaries, edited by Rachel and Arie Aharoni, Sifriat Poalim – Hakibbutz Hameuchad Publishing House Ltd. Bnei Brak/Tel Aviv 2005, {{ISBN|965-02-0299-4}} (in Hebrew), p. 9, "About the Diaries" (preface by Arie Aharoni)</ref> Even though she was fluent and literate in various European languages, Goldberg wrote her published works, as well as her personal notes, only in Hebrew. In 1926, when she was 15 years old, she wrote in her personal diary, "The unfavourable condition of the Hebrew writer is no secret to me [...] Writing in a different language than Hebrew is the same to me as not writing at all. And yet I want to be a writer [...] This is my only objective."<ref name="book" />

Goldberg received a PhD from the Universities of [[University of Berlin|Berlin]] and [[University of Bonn|Bonn]] in Semitic languages and German. Her erudition and renown was such that a leading newspaper in Palestine excitedly reported her plans to [[aliyah|immigrate]] to that country.<ref>[http://www.jpost.com/Metro/Features/Article.aspx?id=251436 The diplomats of the literary world], [[Jerusalem Post]]</ref> In 1935, she settled in [[Tel Aviv]], where she joined a group of Zionist Hebrew poets of Eastern-European origin known as  ''Yachdav'' ({{lang-he|יחדיו}} "together"). This group was led by [[Avraham Shlonsky]] and was characterised by adhering to [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] especially in its Russian [[Acmeist poetry|Acmeist]] form, and rejecting the style of Hebrew poetry that was common among the older generation, particularly that of [[Haim Nachman Bialik]].

She never married and lived with her mother, first in Tel Aviv and later in [[Jerusalem]]. Goldberg was a heavy smoker, and in her late years she became aware of the damage in this habit, as reflected in her poem "About the Damage of Smoking". In the spring of 1969, she was diagnosed with [[breast cancer]]. After removing one of her breasts, her physicians were optimistic. Goldberg went on a short visit to Switzerland, but returned in a bad physical condition, as the cancer spread through her body. She died on 15 January 1970.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://blog.nli.org.il/ze_mikvar/|title=זֶה מִכְּבָר אֵין אִישׁ מְחַכֶּה לִי שָׁם|date=2018-01-15|work=הספרנים|access-date=2018-01-16|language=he-IL}}</ref> Goldberg received the [[Israel Prize]] posthumously, her mother took the prize in her name.

==Literary career==

[[File:PikiWiki Israel 3468 People of Israel - Lea Goldberg - cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|Leah Goldberg (1964)]]


Goldberg worked as a high-school teacher and earned a living writing rhymed advertisements until she was hired as an editor by the Hebrew newspapers [[Davar]] and [[Al HaMishmar]].<ref>[https://www.poetryinternational.org/pi/poet/3094/Lea-Goldberg-and-her-poetry/en/list Poetry International: Lea Goldberg and her poetry]</ref> She also worked as a children’s book editor at Sifriyat Po'alim publishing house, while also writing theatre reviews and literary columns. In 1954 she became a literature lecturer at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], advancing to senior lecturer in 1957 and full professor in 1963, when she was appointed head of the university's Department of Comparative Literature.<ref name="Lea Goldberg and her poetry">{{Cite web |url=http://www.poetryinternationalweb.net/pi/site/cou_article/item/3094/Lea-Goldberg-and-her-poetry/en |title=Lea Goldberg and her poetry |access-date=2013-12-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006144005/http://www.poetryinternationalweb.net/pi/site/cou_article/item/3094/Lea-Goldberg-and-her-poetry/en |archive-date=2014-10-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  

Goldberg wrote [[Modern Hebrew poetry|Hebrew poetry]], drama, and children's literature. Goldberg's books for children, among them "A Flat for Rent" ("דירה להשכיר", ''dira lehaskir'') and "Miracles and Wonders" (ניסים ונפלאות, ''nisim veniflaot''), have become classics of Hebrew-language children's literature.

With exemplary knowledge of seven languages, Goldberg also [[translation|translated]] numerous foreign literary works exclusively into Modern Hebrew from Russian, Lithuanian, German, Italian, French, and English. Of particular note is her ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' of translation, [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]]'s epic novel ''[[War and Peace]]'', as well as translations of [[Rainer Maria Rilke|Rilke]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]], [[Anna Akhmatova|Akhmatova]], [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], and [[Petrarch]], plus many other works including reference books and works for children.

===Novel===
In 1946, Goldberg published her first novel, והוא האור (Hebrew: ''Vehu ha'or'', literally: "And he is the light"; also translated "it is the light", "this is the light"). The novel had a strong autobiographical basis, and has been received as shedding much light on the rest of her work.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=GOLD|first=NILI SCHARF|last2=SCHEINDLIN|first2=RAYMOND P.|date=1997|title=Rereading It Is the Light, Lea Goldberg's Only Novel|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/20689486|journal=Prooftexts|volume=17|issue=3|pages=245–265|issn=0272-9601}}</ref> The book opens with symbolic patricide: the [[Protagonist|protagonist]], Nora, is pressed by someone she meets to describe her parents. She does not want to disclose the fact her father is at a psychiatric hospital and tries to evade the questions, but the other person wouldn't let go, until Nora explodes: "I have no father! My father is dead!  Do you hear? Dead!".  Despite this attempt, the specter of mental illness continues to haunt her throughout the novel.

==Literary style and influences==
Goldberg was widely read in Russian, German, and French poetry.  [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and [[Acmeist poetry|Acmeism]] were strong influences on her style.  Her poetry is notable for coherence and clarity, and for an emphasis on ideas over baroque forms. [[Nili Rachel Scharf Gold|Nili Gold]], Modern Hebrew Literature scholar and editor of the English translation of ''And This is the Light'', has noted Goldberg's "high aestheticism, musicality, and unique merging of intellect and humanity".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=GOLD|first=NILI SCHARF|last2=SCHEINDLIN|first2=RAYMOND P.|date=1997|title=Rereading It Is the Light, Lea Goldberg's Only Novel|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/20689486|journal=Prooftexts|volume=17|issue=3|pages=245–265|issn=0272-9601}}</ref>

Goldberg's poetics perceive the general in the specific: a drop of dew represents vast distances and the concrete reflects the abstract. Her poetry has been described as "a system of echoes and mild reverberations, voices and whispers," that recognizes the limitations of the poem and language. Her work is minor and modest, taking a majestic landscape like the  Jerusalem hills and focusing on a stone, a thorn, one yellow butterfly, a single bird in the sky.<ref name="Lea Goldberg and her poetry"/>

Unlike many of her contemporary peers, most notably [[Nathan Alterman]], Goldberg avoided outright political poetry, and did not contribute [[occasional poetry]] to Hebrew periodicals with overt current-affairs discourse.

==Critical acclaim==
Goldberg received in 1949 the [[Arthur Ruppin|Ruppin]] Prize (for the volume "Al Haprikhá")<ref>[http://jpress2.tau.ac.il/Default/Scripting/ArticleWin_TAU.asp?From=Search&Key=DAV/1949/02/02/4/Ar00406.xml&CollName=DAV_1945_1954&DOCID=134946&PageLabelPrint=&Skin=TAUHe&enter=true&Publication=DAV&AppName=2&Hs=advanced&AW=1252268689484&sPublication=DAV&tau report about the ceremony in Hebrew]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
and, in 1970, the [[Israel Prize]] for literature.<ref name=prize>{{Cite web| title = Israel Prize Official Site – Recipients in 1970 (in Hebrew)| url = http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/Tashkag/Tashlab_Tashkag_Rikuz.htm?DictionaryKey=Tashal}}</ref>

The American Hebraist, [[Gabriel Preil]], wrote a poem about Goldberg: "Leah's Absence".

In 2011, Goldberg was announced as one of four great Israeli poets who would appear on Israel's currency (together with [[Rachel Bluwstein]], [[Shaul Tchernichovsky]], and [[Natan Alterman]]).<ref>Nadav Shemer, ''Jerusalem Post'', March 10, 2011.</ref>
