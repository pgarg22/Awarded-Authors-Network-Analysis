==Biography==
Dinkar was born on 23 September 1908, in [[Simaria]] village in [[Begusarai district|Begusarai]] district in [[Bihar]] (then a part of [[Bengal Presidency]], [[British India]])<ref name="Kumar Vikram 2010 151"/> in a [[Bhumihar]] family<ref>{{cite news |title='राष्‍ट्रकवि' की कविता पढ़ पीएम मोदी ने बढ़ाया हौसला, जानिए क्‍यों खास हैं 'दिनकर' |url=https://www.aajtak.in/education/history/story/pm-modi-addressed-rashtra-kavi-ramdhari-singh-dinkar-while-speaking-on-corona-vaccine-lbse-1193110-2021-01-16 |access-date=24 January 2021 |work=Aaj Tak |date=16 January 2021 |language=hi}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=रामधारी सिंह दिनकर के जरिए BJP का 'भूमिहार' प्रेम |url=https://navbharattimes.indiatimes.com/state/bihar/patna/bihar-bjp-plans-to-celebrate-poet-ramdhari-singh-dinkars-works/articleshow/47385919.cms |access-date=24 January 2021 |work=Navbharat Times |date=22 May 2015 |language=hi}}</ref> to Babu Ravi Singh and Manroop Devi. He was married in Tabhka village of [[Samastipur district|Samastipur]] district in Bihar. As a student, his favourite subjects were history, politics and philosophy. At school and later in college, he studied Hindi, [[Sanskrit]], [[Maithili language|Maithili]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Urdu]] and English literature. Dinkar was greatly influenced by [[Muhammad Iqbal|Iqbal]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[John Keats|Keats]] and [[John Milton|Milton]] and translated works of [[Rabindranath Tagore]] from [[Bengali language|Bengali]] to [[Hindi]].<ref>{{cite book

As a student, Dinkar had to battle day to day issues, some related to their family's economic circumstances. When he was a student of Mokama High School, it was not possible for him to stay on till school closed at four p.m.<ref name="Kumar Vikram 2010 151"/> as he had to leave the class after the lunch break to catch the steamer back home.<ref name="Kumar Vikram 2010 151"/> He could not afford to be in the hostel which would have enabled him to attend all periods.<ref name="Kumar Vikram 2010 151"/> How could a student who had no shoes on his feet manage the hostel fees? His poetry later showed the impact of poverty.<ref name="Kumar Vikram 2010 151"/> This was the environment in which Dinkar grew up and became a nationalist poet of radical views.<ref name="Kumar Vikram 2010 151"/> In 1920, Dinkar saw [[Mahatma Gandhi]] for the first time.<ref name="Kumar Vikram 2010 151"/> About this time, he founded Manoranjan Library at Simariya.<ref name="Kumar Vikram 2010 151"/> He also edited a handwritten pamphlet.<ref name="Kumar Vikram 2010 151"/>

===Creative Struggle===
When Dinkar stepped into his adolescence, the Indian freedom movement had already begun under the leadership of [[Mahatma Gandhi]].<ref name="Kumar Vikram 2010 151"/> In 1929, when after matriculation, he entered [[Patna College]] to study intermediate; this movement started becoming aggressive.<ref name="Kumar Vikram 2010 151"/> In 1928, the [[Simon Commission]], against which nationwide demonstrations were being held, arrived.<ref name="Kumar Vikram 2010 151"/> Demonstrations were held in [[Patna]] too and Dinkar too signed the oath-paper.<ref name="Kumar Vikram 2010 151"/> Thousands came to the rally at [[Gandhi Maidan]] in which Dinkar also participated.<ref name="Kumar Vikram 2010 151"/> During the protest against [[Simon Commission]], the police of the British government mercilessly [[Baton charge|lathi charged]] the Lion of Punjab, [[Lala Lajpat Rai]], who succumbed to the injuries.<ref name="Kumar Vikram 2010 151"/> The whole country was in turmoil.<ref name="Kumar Vikram 2010 151"/> The youthful mind of Dinkar became increasingly radical due to these agitations. His emotional nature was charged with poetic energy.<ref name="Kumar Vikram 2010 151"/>

Dinkar's first poem was published in 1924 in a paper called {{Transl|hi|Chhatra Sahodar}} ('Brother of Students'). {{Transl|hi|Chhatra Sahodar}} was a local newspaper established under the editorship of Narsingh Das.<ref name="Kumar Vikram 2010 151"/> In 1928, the peasant's [[satyagraha]] under the leadership of [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]] proved successful in [[Bardoli]] of [[Gujarat]].<ref name="Kumar Vikram 2010 151"/> He wrote ten poems based on this Satyagraha which was published in a book form under the title {{Transl|hi|Vijay-Sandesh}} ('Message of Victory').<ref name="Kumar Vikram 2010 151"/> This composition is now available.<ref name="Kumar Vikram 2010 151"/> Right in front of [[Patna College]], the office of Yuvak functioned.<ref name="Kumar Vikram 2010 151"/> To escape the wrath of the government, Dinkar's poems were published under the pseudonym "Amitabh".<ref name="Kumar Vikram 2010 151"/> On 14 September 1928, a poem of his, on the martyrdom of [[Jatin Das]], was published.<ref name="Kumar Vikram 2010 151"/> Around this time he wrote two small works of poetry called {{Transl|hi|Birbala}} and {{Transl|hi|Meghnad-Vadh}}, but neither of them are traceable now.<ref name="Kumar Vikram 2010 151"/> In 1930, he composed a poem called {{Transl|hi|Pran-Bhang}} ('The Breach of Vow'), which was mentioned by [[Ramchandra Shukla]] in his history.<ref name="Kumar Vikram 2010 151"/> So the journey of his poetic career should be deemed to have begun with {{Transl|hi|Vijay-Sandesh}}.<ref name="Kumar Vikram 2010 151"/> Before this his poems had become a frequent feature of the magazine {{Transl|hi|Desh}}, published from [[Patna]] and of {{Transl|hi|Pratibha}}, which was published from [[Kannauj]].<ref name="Kumar Vikram 2010 151"/>

Dinkar's first collection of poems, {{Transl|hi|Renuka}}, was published in November 1935.<ref name="Kumar Vikram 2010 151"/> [[Banarsi Das Chaturvedi]], the editor of {{Transl|hi|Vishal Bharat}}, wrote that [[Hindi]]-speaking people should celebrate the publication of {{Transl|hi|Renuka}}.<ref name="Kumar Vikram 2010 151"/> Around this time, Chaturvediji went to [[Sevagram]].<ref name="Kumar Vikram 2010 151"/> He took with him a copy of {{Transl|hi|Renuka}}.<ref name="Kumar Vikram 2010 151"/> The copy was given to [[Mahatma Gandhi]].<ref name="Kumar Vikram 2010 151"/>

The famous historian Dr. [[K.P. Jayaswal|Kashi Prasad Jaiswal]] is said to have loved him like a son. During the early days of Dinkar's poetic career, Jaiswal helped him in every way.<ref name="Kumar Vikram 2010 151"/> Jaiswal died on 4 August 1937, which was a great blow to the young poet.<ref name="Kumar Vikram 2010 151"/> Much later, he wrote in {{Transl|hi|Kalpna}}, a magazine published from [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], "It was a good thing that Jaiswalji was my first admirer. Now when I have savoured the love and encouragement of the Sun, Moon, Varun, Kuber, Indra, Brihaspati, Shachi and Brahmani, it is clear that none of them was like Jaiswalji. As I heard the news of his death, the world became a dark place for me. I did not know what to do."<ref name="Kumar Vikram 2010 151"/> Jaiswalji was the first person to appreciate the historical sense in the poetry of Dinkar.<ref name="Kumar Vikram 2010 151"/>


==Work==
His works are mostly of {{Transl|hi|Veer Rasa}}, or the 'brave mode', although {{Transl|hi|Urvashi}} is an exception to this. Some of his greatest works are ''[[Rashmirathi]]'' and [[Parashuram ki Prateeksha|''Parashuram ki Prateeksha'']]. He is hailed as the greatest Hindi poet of 'Veer Rasa' since Bhushan.<ref name="Vijendra Narayan 2005"/>

[[Acharya]] (teacher) [[Hazari Prasad Dwivedi]] wrote that Dinkar was very popular among people whose mother-tongue was not [[Hindi]] and he was a symbol of love for one's own mother-tongue.<ref name="'Dinkar' 2008">{{cite book

[[Hindi]] writer [[Rajendra Yadav]], whose novel {{Transl|hi|Sara Akash}} also carried a few lines of Dinkar's poetry, has said of him, "He was always very inspiring to read.

Dinkar :

{{quote|''Examples of inter-mixture and cultural harmony among peoples belonging to different races, languages and faiths are available in some other countries too (such as Mexico and Ancient Greece), but not to the same extent as in India. In the world there are but four colours of people – white, wheatish, black and yellow – and all four are profusely inter-mixed in the Indian populace. Even linguistically, the offspring of all the major language families live together in this country. And as for religion, India as a whole has always been, from the beginning, a land common to all the major religions of the world. The Indians of Tiruvankur had become Christian long before the people of England, and Islam had perhaps already arrived among the Moplas while Prophet Mohammad was still alive. Similarly, the followers of Zoroaster have been inhabiting India since the tenth century. When the Arab Muslims occupied Iran and began to propagate their own religion there, the [[Parsis]] fled Iran and came to settle in India. When the Jewish temples began to crumble under the Roman tyranny, a number of Jews fled to India in order to save their faith, and ever since they have been living happily in South India. Therefore, Christianity, Islam, Judaism and Parsi religions have as much a claim over India as Hinduism or Buddhism has.''}}

India's antecedent composite cultural catalytic formation is suggestively sketched out by Dinkar as a product of four cultural revolutions and acculturative tendencies: (a) Aryan-Dravidian (Mongoloid) racial aggregations and admixtures and Indo-European/Dravidian/(Tibeto-Burman) linguistic agglomerations and transitions; (b) [[Vedic]] or [[Brahman]]ical foundational worldview and [[Jain]], [[Buddhist]], [[Bhakti]], [[Sikh]], [[Sufi]], and a variety of neo-Hindu reform movements; (c) Hindu-Muslim encounter, coexistence, and osmosis; and (d) Indo-European contact and British colonial conquest of India.<ref name="Kukreja & Singh 2008 340">{{cite book
