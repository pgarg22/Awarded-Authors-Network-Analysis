He also played Whitney Ellsworth on the [[HBO]] Western drama series ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'', which brought him acclaim and a [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]] nomination for Ensemble Acting, and Sheriff Shelby Parlow on the FX series ''[[Justified (TV series)|Justified]]''. His [[memoir]] ''Life's That Way'' was published in April 2009.<ref name="lifesthatway.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.lifesthatway.com|title=Life's That Way - Home|work=lifesthatway.com|access-date=18 August 2016}}</ref>

==Early life==
Beaver was born in [[Laramie, Wyoming]], the son of Dorothy Adell (''[[married and maiden names|née]]'' Crawford) (1928-2019) and James Norman Beaver (1924–2004), a [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/31/Jim-Beaver.html|title=Jim Beaver Biography (1950-)|work=filmreference.com|access-date=18 August 2016}}</ref> His father was of [[English people|English]] and [[French people|French]] heritage; the family name was originally de Beauvoir, and Beaver is a distant cousin of author and philosopher [[Simone de Beauvoir]] and Pennsylvania governor General [[James A. Beaver]].<ref>Beaver, Irvin, ''History and genealogy of the Bieber, Beaver, Biever, Beeber family'', Higginson Book Co., 2003, ASIN B0006S644M</ref> Beaver's mother has [[Cherokee]], [[Germans|German]], and [[Scottish people|Scottish]] ancestry, and is a descendant of three-time U.S. Attorney General [[John J. Crittenden]].<ref>Coleman, Mrs. Chapman, ''The Life of John J. Crittenden'', Da Capo Press, 1970, {{ISBN|0-306-71843-X}}</ref>

Although his parents' families had both long been in Texas, Beaver was born in Laramie, as his father was doing graduate work in accounting at the [[University of Wyoming]]. Returning to Texas, Beaver Sr. worked as an accountant and as a minister for the [[Church of Christ]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], [[Crowley, Texas|Crowley]], [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], and [[Grapevine, Texas|Grapevine]]. For most of Beaver's youth, his family lived in [[Irving, Texas]], even while his father preached in surrounding communities. He and his three younger sisters (Denise, Reneé, and Teddlie) all attended [[Irving High School (Irving, Texas)|Irving High School]], where he was a classmate of [[ZZ Top]] drummer [[Frank Beard (musician)|Frank Beard]], but he transferred in his senior year to [[Fort Worth Christian Academy]], from which he graduated in 1968. He also took courses at [[Fort Worth Christian College]]. Later, he attended [[Oklahoma Christian University|Oklahoma Christian College]]. Despite having appeared in some elementary school plays, he showed no particular interest in an acting career, but immersed himself in film history and expressed a desire for a career as a writer, publishing a few short stories in his high school anthology.

==Military service and education==
Fewer than two months after his graduation from high school, Beaver followed several of his close friends into the [[United States Marine Corps]]. Following basic training at [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego]], Beaver was trained there as a microwave radio relay technician. He served at the [[Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Twentynine Palms|Marine Corps Base Twentynine Palms]] and at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton]] before being transferred to the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]] near [[Da Nang]], [[South Vietnam]] in 1970. He served as a radio operator at an outlying detachment of the [[1st Marine Regiment (United States)|1st Marine Regiment]], then as supply chief for the division communications company. He returned to the U.S. in 1971 and was discharged as Corporal (E-4), though he remained active in the [[Marine Forces Reserve|Marine Reserve]] until 1976.

Upon his release from active duty in 1971, Beaver returned to Irving, and worked briefly for [[Frito-Lay]] as a corn-chip dough mixer. He entered what is now [[Oklahoma Christian University]], where he became interested in theatre. He made his true theatrical debut in a small part in ''[[The Miracle Worker (play)|The Miracle Worker]]''. The following year, he transferred to Central State University (now known as the [[University of Central Oklahoma]]). He performed in numerous plays in college and supported himself as a cabdriver, a movie projectionist, a tennis-club maintenance man, and an amusement-park stuntman at [[Frontier City]]. He also worked as a newscaster and hosted jazz and classical music programs on radio station [[KUCO (FM)|KCSC]]. During his college days, he also began to write, completing several plays and also his first book, on actor [[John Garfield]], while still a student. Beaver graduated with a degree in Oral Communications in 1975.<ref>Author dust jacket bio, Beaver, James N., ''John Garfield: His Life and Films'', Cranbury NJ: A.S. Barnes & Co., 1978, {{ISBN|0-498-01890-3}}</ref> He briefly pursued graduate studies, but soon returned to Irving, Texas.

==Career==
[[File:J Beaver Deadwood.jpg|thumb|195px|right|Beaver as his Whitney Ellsworth character in ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'']]

Beaver made his professional stage debut in October 1972, while still a college student, in ''Rain'', from [[W. Somerset Maugham]]'s short story, at the Oklahoma Theatre Center in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]]. After returning to Texas, he did a great deal of local theatre in the Dallas area, supporting himself as a film cleaner at a 16&nbsp;mm film rental firm and as a stagehand for the Dallas Ballet. He joined the [[Shakespeare Festival of Dallas]] in 1976, performing in numerous productions. In 1979, he was commissioned by [[Actors Theatre of Louisville]] to write the first of three plays for that company (''Spades'', ''Sidekick'' and ''Semper Fi''), and was twice a finalist in the theatre's national Great American Play Contest (for ''Once Upon a Single Bound'' and ''Verdigris''). Along with plays, he continued writing for film journals and for several years was a columnist, critic and feature writer for the [[National Board of Review of Motion Pictures]] magazine ''Films in Review''.

Moving to New York City in 1979, Beaver worked steadily onstage in stock and on tour, simultaneously writing plays and researching a biography of actor [[George Reeves]] (a project which he still pursues between acting jobs). He appeared in starring roles in such plays as ''[[The Hasty Heart]]'' and ''[[The Rainmaker (play)|The Rainmaker]]'' in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] and ''[[L'Alouette (The Lark)|The Lark]]'' in [[Manchester, New Hampshire]], and toured the country as Macduff in ''[[Macbeth]]'' and in ''The Last Meeting of the Knights of the White Magnolia''. During this period, he ghostwrote the book ''Movie Blockbusters'' for critic [[Steven Scheuer]].

In 1983, he moved to [[Los Angeles, California]] to continue research on his biography of [[George Reeves]]. He worked for a year as the film archivist for the Variety Arts Center. Following a reading of his play ''Verdigris,'' he was asked to join the prestigious [[Theatre West]] company in Hollywood, where he continues as an actor and playwright to this day. ''Verdigris'' was produced to very good reviews in 1985 and Beaver was signed by the powerful Triad Artists agency. He immediately began to work writing episodes of various television series, including ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1985)|Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' (he received a 1987 [[CableACE Award]] nomination for his very first TV script, for this show), ''[[Tour of Duty (TV series)|Tour of Duty]]'' and ''Vietnam War Story''. He also worked occasionally in small roles in films and television.

The 1988 [[Writers Guild of America]] strike fundamentally altered the freelance television writing market, and Beaver's television writing career came to an abrupt halt. However, a chance meeting led to his being cast as the best friend of star [[Bruce Willis]] in [[Norman Jewison]]'s drama about Vietnam veterans, ''[[In Country]]'', and his acting career suddenly took up the slack where his television writing career had faltered. (Beaver was the only actual Vietnam veteran among the principal cast of ''In Country''.)

Subsequently, he has appeared in many popular films, including ''[[Sister Act]]'', ''[[Sliver (film)|Sliver]]'', ''[[Bad Girls (1994 film)|Bad Girls]]'', ''[[Adaptation (film)|Adaptation.]]'', ''[[Magnolia (film)|Magnolia]]'' and ''[[The Life of David Gale]]''. He starred in the television series ''Thunder Alley'' as the comic sidekick to [[Ed Asner]], and as homicide cop Earl Gaddis on ''[[Reasonable Doubts]]''. He was also [[French Stewart]]'s sullen boss Happy Doug on the sitcom ''[[3rd Rock from the Sun]]''.

In 2002, Beaver was cast as one of the stars of the ensemble Western drama ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'' in the role of Whitney Ellsworth, a goldminer whom he often described as "[[Gabby Hayes]] with [[Tourette syndrome]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miskatonic.org/rara-avis/archives/200409/0178.html|title=RARA-AVIS Archives: Re: RARA-AVIS: RE: Deadwood|work=miskatonic.org|access-date=18 August 2016}}</ref> Ellsworth went from being a filth-covered reprobate to marrying the richest woman in town and becoming a beloved and stalwart figure in the community. (Originally Ellsworth did not have a first name, but when it became necessary to provide one, Beaver requested he be named Whitney Ellsworth, after the producer of [[George Reeves]]'s ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]''.) He continued his long research for the Reeves biography, and in 2005 served as the historical/biographical consultant on the theatrical feature film about Reeves's death, ''[[Hollywoodland]]''.

Beaver in 2006 joined the cast of the HBO drama ''[[John from Cincinnati]]'' while simultaneously playing the recurring roles of [[Bobby Singer]] on ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'' and Carter Reese on another HBO drama ''[[Big Love]]'', appearing at least once a season on ''Supernatural''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/38585/some-hints-whats-coming-supernatural-season-six |title=Some Hints of What's Coming in Supernatural Season Six|date=17 July 2010|work=dreadcentral.com|access-date=18 August 2016}}</ref> He then took on the role of Sheriff Charlie Mills in the CBS drama ''[[Harper's Island]]''. He has recurred as the gun dealer Lawson on ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' and its prequel ''[[Better Call Saul]]'', and played Sheriff Shelby Parlow for three seasons on [[FX (TV channel)|FX's]] ''[[Justified (TV series)|Justified]]''.

Following his acclaimed work in ''Justified'', Beaver had a starring role in [[Guillermo del Toro]]'s gothic ghost story feature film, ''[[Crimson Peak]]'', in a part del Toro wrote for him. He has also completed roles in the feature films ''[[The Frontier (2015 film)|The Frontier]]'' and ''[[Billy Boy (2017 film)|Billy Boy]]''.

His memoir of the year following his wife's 2003 diagnosis of lung cancer, entitled ''Life's That Way'', was purchased in a preemptive bid by [[G. P. Putnam's Sons|Putnam/Penguin]] publishers in the fall of 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6478677.html?industryid=47146 |title=article|work=publishersweekly.com|access-date=18 August 2016}}</ref> Prior to publication in April, 2009, it was chosen for the [[Barnes & Noble]] ''Discover Great New Writers'' program for 2009.<ref name="lifesthatway.com"/>

His performance in ''The Silence of Bees'' won him the Best Actor Award at the 2010 [[New York Film and Video Festival]].<ref>[http://nyfilmvideo.info/2009-festival-awards/2010-awards.htm Nyfilmvideo.info]; Archived at: {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100518110706/http://nyfilmvideo.info/2009-festival-awards/2010-awards.htm |date=May 18, 2010}}</ref>

Beaver was nominated for Best Guest Performance in a Drama by the Broadcast Television Journalists' Association Critics' Choice Awards in 2013, for his performance as Sheriff Shelby Parlow on ''Justified''. (He lost to [[Jane Fonda]].) He was on many industry prediction lists for the 2013 Emmy for that performance, but was ultimately not nominated.

He wrote and directed the short film ''Night Riders'' (2013), based upon his play of the same title.

In 2014, he was given the Lifetime Merit Award of the [[Idyllwild International Festival of Cinema]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.idyllwildcinemafest.com/award-categories-2014/ |title=Idyllwildcinemafest.com |access-date=2014-02-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320015325/http://www.idyllwildcinemafest.com/award-categories-2014/ |archive-date=2014-03-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Beaver studied acting with [[Clyde Ventura]] and Academy Award-winning actor [[Maximilian Schell]].<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.hbo.com/deadwood/cast/actor/jimbeaver.shtml Jim Beaver: HBO: Deadwood<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In March 2015, [[Theatre West]] presented a 30th anniversary revival of Beaver's play ''Verdigris'', with Beaver in a starring role.

Actress [[Maureen Stapleton]] played the leading role in a workshop of Beaver's play ''Verdigris'' in 1985 at the [[Berkshire Theatre Festival]]. In June, 2016, Beaver returned to the Festival to play Big Daddy in [[Tennessee Williams]]'s ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.troyrecord.com/opinion/20160622/john-grays-fade-to-gray-column-beaver-on-a-hot-tin-roof|title=John Gray's Fade to Gray column: Beaver on a hot tin roof|work=troyrecord.com|date=21 June 2016|access-date=18 August 2016}}</ref>

==Personal life==
For several years after his move to California, Beaver shared a house with character actor [[Hank Worden]], who had been a friend since Beaver's childhood.

During college, Beaver married a fellow student, Debbie Young, in August 1973; the couple separated four months later, though divorce did not occur until 1976.

In 1989, following four years of dating, Beaver married actress and casting director [[Cecily Adams]], daughter of comic actor and voiceover artist [[Don Adams]]. Their daughter, Madeline, was born in 2001. Adams died of [[lung cancer]] on March 3, 2004.<ref name=autogenerated1/>

Beaver has been in a romantic relationship since 2016 with actress-singer [[Sarah Spiegel (singer)|Sarah Spiegel]]. They became engaged in May, 2018, and were married June 20, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://popculture.com/celebrity-couples/2019/06/21/the-ranch-actor-jim-beaver-marries-sarah-spiegel/|title = 'The Ranch' Actor Jim Beaver Marries Sarah Spiegel}}</ref>
