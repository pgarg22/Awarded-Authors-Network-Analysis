'''Moa Martinson''', born '''Helga Maria Swarts''' sometimes spelt '''Swartz''', (2{{nbsp}}November 1890{{snd}}5{{nbsp}}August 1964) was one of Sweden's most noted authors of [[proletarian literature]].<ref name=arbetaren group=w>{{cite web|last1=Reimerthi|first1=Malin|title=Moa hjälpte läsarna förstå klassamhället|trans-title=Moa helped readers understand the class system|url=http://arbetaren.se/artiklar/moa-hjalpte-lasarna-forsta-klassamhallet/|website=www.arbetaren.se|publisher=[[Arbetaren]]|access-date=17 November 2015}}</ref> Her ambition was to change society with her authorship and to portray the conditions of the working class, and also the personal development of women.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=7}} Her works were about motherhood, love, poverty, politics, religion, urbanization and the hard living conditions of the working-class woman.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=60}}

== Early life ==
Martinson was born on 2{{nbsp}}November 1890 in Vårdnäs, [[Linköping Municipality]]. Her mother was Kristina Swartz (sometimes spelt Christina Schwartz) who served as a maid wherever jobs were available. There are no legal records stating who her father was,<ref name=Moa group=w /> but according to researchers Annika Johansson and Bonnie Festin, he was probably Anders Teodor Andersson, a farmhand who served at the Kärr farm in [[Motala]] at the same time as Swartz.<ref name=barndom group=w>{{cite web|last1=Sandelin|first1=Ann-Charlotte|title=På vandring i Moa Martinsons barndom|trans-title=A walk through Moa Martinson's childhood|date=5 April 2015|url=http://www.kultursidan.nu/?p=19340|website=www.kultursidan.nu|publisher=Kultursidan.nu|access-date=26 November 2015}}</ref> Since she carried, what in those days was referred to as an [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]] child, she had to go to her parents home for the birth. Swartz' father, Nils Peter Swartz, was a poor [[Allotment system|soldier]] who lived with his wife, Carin Olofsdotter, in a derelict [[Torp (architecture)|croft]] in Vårdnäs.<ref name=Moa group=w /><ref name=liv group=w /><ref name=berattelsen group=w /> On 17{{nbsp}}February 1891, Swartz sued Andersson{{efn|At that time renamed Lundin by the factory he then worked for.<ref name="far" group=w />}} for [[child support]] at the Motala [[District courts of Sweden|district court]],{{efn|''Tingsrätten'', up until 1971 called ''häradsrätten''.<ref group=w>{{cite web|title=Tingsrätt|url=http://www.ne.se/uppslagsverk/encyklopedi/l%c3%a5ng/tingsr%c3%a4tt|website=www.ne.se|publisher=[[Nationalencyklopedin]]|access-date=26 November 2015}}</ref>}} where two witnesses testified that they had seen her and Andersson in the same bed around the time the child would have been conceived.<ref name="barndom" group=w /> Andersson failed to appear in court in February as well as on the two following hearings. Swartz finally said that he had gone to America and the proceedings were stayed.<ref name=far group=w>{{cite web|last1=Johansson|first1=Annika|title=Vem var Moa Martinsons far?|trans-title=Who was Moa Martinson's father?|url=http://www.ogf.info/dokument/Lovet-101.pdf|website=www.ogf.info|publisher=Östgöta Genealogiska Förening|access-date=26 November 2015}}</ref>

The identity of her father was unknown to Martinson her entire life, but her speculations about who it could be were an inspiration for her work. In her book ''Pigmamma'' ("''Maid Mother''") she portrays her mother's situation as pregnant with a married man's child.<ref name=NE group=w>{{cite web|title=Moa Martinson|url=http://www.ne.se/uppslagsverk/encyklopedi/l%C3%A5ng/moa-martinson|website=www.ne.se|publisher=[[Nationalencyklopedin]]|access-date=17 November 2015}}</ref> At one point she thought that her father was a married man, whom her mother had worked for.<ref name="far" group=w /> Her romantic view of her mysterious father decreased as time went by. In her book ''[[My Mother Gets Married|Mor gifter sig]]'' (''My Mother Gets Married''), written twelve years later, it became clear how much Martinson despised her absent father. In ''Fjäderbrevet'' (''The Feather Letter''), written another six years later, there is no mention of him at all.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=11}}<ref name=Moa group=w>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Furuland |first=Lars|title =H Maria (Moa) Martinson|encyclopedia =[[Svenskt biografiskt lexikon]]|year =1985–1987|publisher =[[National Archives of Sweden]]|location =Stockholm |language=Swedish|volume=25|page=220|url =https://sok.riksarkivet.se/SBL/Presentation.aspx?id=9141|access-date=17 November 2015}}</ref>

During the first years of her life, Martinson lived with her paternal grandparents and their youngest daughter Hulda while Swartz worked as a maid or in the [[Textile manufacturing|textile mills]] in [[Norrköping]].<ref name=liv group=w>{{cite web|last1=Engman|first1=Kerstin|title=Moas liv|trans-title=Moa's life|url=http://www.moamartinson.se/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=46&Itemid=29|website=www.moamartinson.se|publisher=The Moa Martinson Literary Society|access-date=17 November 2015}}</ref> There are several discrepancies in the timeline of Martinson's early years between official records and her books. These are most likely due to that her stories built on the oral traditions of the family.<ref name=Moa group=w /> In 1892, her grandfather became ill and died and her grandmother could no longer take care of Martinson so she went to live with her mother. There is no record of where they lived until 1894, when they moved to Norrköping. Swartz earned very little money. In 1894–1896, she worked at Norrköping's wool weaving mills, where working conditions were extremely bad and wages low.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=14}} During her early school years, Martinson had a stepfather, Alfred Karlsson,<ref name=liv group=w /> who she described as an alcoholic. He was a sometime [[statare]] who worked odd jobs in the countryside outside Norrköping. He married Swartz on 11{{nbsp}}March 1896,<ref name=berattelsen group=w /> and they had three more daughters, but they all died within days of being born.<ref name=liv group=w /> After the years at the textile mill, the family moved several times to different locations in [[Östergötland]], settling down for a time wherever work was available.<ref name=Moa group=w /> This affected Martinson's schooling since they only stayed in one place for a couple of months. Despite this, she left school with high marks after six years in 1903.<ref name=liv group=w /> She was [[Confirmation|confirmed]] in 1905 in Risinge Church, [[Finspång Municipality]], after which she got her first job at a farm in [[Vikbolandet]].<ref name=berattelsen group=w />

In Martinson's book ''Kvinnor och äppleträd'' (''Women and Apple Trees''), which is set in Norrköping, she described the hard and ruthless situation that she and her mother was in during the 1890s. Because of the book, Martinson was accused for denigration by right-wing  critics, but Martinson said that what she did was the opposite.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=14}} The different run-down lodgings the family moved in and out of are described in the books ''Kyrkbröllop'' (''Church wedding'') and (''My Mother Gets Married'') as well as in a couple of the short stories in ''Jag möter en diktare'' (''I meet a poet'').<ref name=berattelsen group=w />

=== Kitchen maid and pantry chef ===
[[File:Moa Martinssons trappa i Sylten, Norrköping.jpg|thumb|upright|Moa Martinsson's Stairs in Sylten, Norrköping]]
At the age of fifteen, she trained to become a [[Garde manger|pantry chef]];{{sfn|Engman|2004|pp=29–34}} at the time, she was the youngest in that profession in Sweden.<ref name=visitnynas group=w>{{cite web|title=Johannesdal – Moas torp|trans-title=Johannesdal – Moa's torp|url=http://www.visitnynashamn.se/gora/aktorer/johannesdalmoastorp.5.43601185137ec5bcbf780003164.html|website=www.visitnynashamn.se|publisher=Nynäshamns Turistbyrå|access-date=12 April 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504202417/http://www.visitnynashamn.se/gora/aktorer/johannesdalmoastorp.5.43601185137ec5bcbf780003164.html|archive-date=4 May 2016}}</ref> During the summer of 1906, she worked as a kitchen maid in the main restaurant at the [[Norrköping Exhibition of Art and Industry]]. Situated at the top of ''Syltberget'' ("Sylt Hill"), the restaurant was accessed by an 80-steps stairway. In ''Kungens rosor'' (''The King's Roses''), Martinsson recounts her work in the restaurant and mentions the stairs. The novel got its name from a conversation that she had at the exhibition with King [[Oscar II of Sweden]] on 3{{nbsp}}July 1906.{{sfn|Höjer|Höjer|1996|pp=12–45}}{{sfn|Loos|1972|p=109f}} The conversation revolved around flowers, which the King said that he felt had souls. {{As of|2016}}, the stairs remain and have been named "Moa Martinson's Stairs".{{sfn|Höjer|Höjer|1996|pp=43–71}}{{sfn|Kindahl|1994}}

{{quote| "In the midst of summer, she walks down the eighty steps. Counting them out loud one after the other, even though she knows very well their number. It is cloudy, almost dark, even though it is only July. The bright nights are waning. The scents of roses and honeysuckles waft around her. She stops, enthralled by the silence and beauty of the summer night. The noise from the day's bustle still lingers in her ears."|From ''The King's Roses''{{sfn|Martinson|1990}}}}

In 1906, Martinson moved to [[Stockholm]] in the hope of getting a job, but this turned out to be harder than she expected. During the financial depression of 1907–1909, she had to move back to Norrköping. At this time, she followed events related to concerns about the labour market. This period of Martinson's life had a significant impact on her political engagement. She also wrote poems and sent a collection to a notary interested in literature, but her work was rejected.{{sfn|Engman|2004|pp=29–34}} She later described the poems as "lofty", since that was how she thought such texts should be written.<ref name=liv group=w />

== First marriage ==
[[File:Moas stuga, 2018a.jpg|thumb|left|Johannesdal torp where Martinson lived]]
In 1908–1909, Martinson worked as a pantry chef at restaurants and hotels in Sweden. In the winter of 1909, she met Karl Johansson in [[Ösmo]]. He was nine years older than her, and was a [[Stonemasonry|stone worker]] who lived with his brother Valfrid and their father Johan Petter in a [[Torp (architecture)|torp]] called Johannesdal, in the woods between Ösmo and [[Sorunda]].<ref name=berattelsen group=w>{{cite web|last1=Johansson|first1=Liz|title=Berättelsen om Moa|trans-title=The story about Moa|url=http://hem.fyristorg.com/artic/moa.html|website=www.hem.fyristorg.com|publisher=Arctic News|access-date=18 November 2015}}</ref> She became pregnant in March 1909 and Johansson proposed, but Martinson was doubtful about marrying him. Despite this, she and Karl moved to Johannesdal and in her book ''Den osynlige älskaren'' ("''The Invisible Lover''") she wrote about her first year as mother and wife, the hard life in Johannesdal and how she desperately wanted to get away.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=35}}

In 1910, her first son Olof was born, and in 1922 she and Johansson were married. The reason she hesitated for such a long time to marry him was partly due to Johansson's drinking and partly because she did not want to live in the dark forest.<ref name=berattelsen group=w />
After the birth of Olof, the family soon expanded. In 1911, their second son Tore was born, followed by three more sons: Erik in 1913, Manfred in 1914 and Knut in 1916.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=43}} The birth of Knut was especially hard, since she had to deliver him all alone on the kitchen floor in the torp.<ref name=tell group=w>{{cite web|last1=Tell|first1=Lisbeth|title=DN-gratulerar: Moa – eländets expert.

Life on Johannesdal was poor and hard but the upbringing of her sons was important to Martinson. She was opposed to [[Corporal punishment in the home|spanking]] children and disliked the militant [[Romantic nationalism|nationalistic romanticism]] taught in schools at the time.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=55}}

== Political involvement ==
[[File:Statyn av Moa Martinsson Norrköping april 2006.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Moa Martinsson in Norrköping, by [[Peter Linde]]]]
Martinson's political interest started to develop in 1921, when unemployment in Sweden was higher than ever before, and in 1922 she and Johansson joined the [[Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden]] where Martinson became very active.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=60}} To further educate herself, she read the works of authors like [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Émile Zola]], [[Maxim Gorky]] and [[Martin Andersen Nexø]]. Because of her political interest in better pay and conditions for workers and her ability to speak in any context, she was elected to the municipal council in Sorunda where she represented the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|labour party]].<ref name=kirjasto group=w>{{cite web|last1=Liukkonen|first1=Petri|title=Moa Martinson (1890–1964) – original name Helga Maria Swartz|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/moamar.htm|work=Books and Writers|date=2008|publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library|location=Finland|access-date=23 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103232550/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/moamar.htm|archive-date=3 January 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> She resigned from office in 1926.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=61–69}}
In November 1922, Martinsson wrote her first article<ref name=svensk group=w>{{cite web|last1=Nilsson|first1=Johan|title=Moa Martinson och de tiotusen timmarna|trans-title=Moa Martinson and the ten thousand hours|url=http://www.svensklararforeningen.se/objfiles/1/FoFMoa10000_350378064.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118185343/http://www.svensklararforeningen.se/objfiles/1/FoFMoa10000_350378064.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=18 November 2015|website=www.svensklararforeningen.se|publisher=Svenslärarföreningen|access-date=17 November 2015}}</ref> for the [[Syndicalism|syndicalist]] paper ''[[Arbetaren]]'''s ("''The Worker's''") page for women.<ref name=SAC group=w>{{cite web|title=Martinson, Moa 1890–1964|url=https://www.sac.se/Om-SAC/Historik/Biografier/Ej-f%C3%A4rdiga-biografier/Martinson,-Moa-1890-1964|website=www.sac.se|publisher=[[Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden]]|access-date=17 November 2015}}</ref> She continued writing for the paper and in 1923 she had articles published weekly in ''Arbetaren''. In her articles she wrote about how men and women should work together for a better world. She frequently engaged in debates, especially those involving women's issues.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=70}}

With her work for ''Arbetaren'' she developed her writing skills, but even though she often pushed the boundaries in her articles, she went too far in 1924, when she wrote that women and men should receive equal pay for equal work. Quarrels started at the magazine, resulting in Martinson resigning from the paper, but due to her contributions in ''Arbetaren'' she was now known to the public although mostly in syndicalistic circles.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=80}}

One author who had significant impact on Martinson was Martin Andersen Näxö. It was the first time she recognized her own experiences in a literary work. She wrote a letter to him, telling him about her own life and also sent an article she had written for ''Arbetaren''. Näxö responded positively, telling her she should write a book about her life. Shortly afterwards Martinson started writing the book ''Pigmamman'' ("''The Maid Mother''"). In 1925, she worked for a new magazine called ''Vi kvinnor'' ("''We women''"), where she contributed with articles, novels and [[causerie]]s.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=83}}

== Magazine articles ==
In April 1925, Martinson's two youngest sons, Manfred and Knut, went through the ice and drowned in the lake Styran by the torp and she was devastated.<ref name=liv group=w />{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=94}}<ref name=minnernas group=w /><ref name=modernist group=w>{{cite web|last1=Altstadt|first1=Ann-Charlott|title=Moa Martinson – modernist & feminist|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/kultur/article20069439.ab|website=www.aftonbladet.se|publisher=[[Aftonbladet]]|date=26 December 2014|access-date=17 November 2015}}</ref> She worked incessantly to keep her grief at bay.<ref name=berattelsen group=w />

In September 1925, ''Vi Kvinnor'' was discontinued and soon after Martinson started working for ''Arbetaren'' again. She also worked for the paper ''[[Brand (magazine)|Brand]]'' in April 1925, and became part of the political circles in Stockholm. She wrote her first story ''Pigmamma'' ("''Maid Mother''") in 1924–25, and it was published as a serial in ''Brand'' in 1927.<ref name="kirjasto" group=w /> In June 1926, her first article for ''[[Syndikalistiska Arbetarefederationen|Arbetarekuriren]]'' was published{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=96}} and in 1927 her work was published in ''Templar-kuriren'' ("''The [[IOGT-NTO|Templars]] Courier''"), ''Arbetaren'' and ''Nynäshamns-posten'' ("''The Nynäshamn Post''").<ref name="minnernas" group=w>{{cite web | first1=Karl-Olof | last1=Andersson | title=Fattiga fann tröst och kraft i Moas böcker | trans-title=Poor people found comfort in Moa's books | url=http://minnenasjournal.nu/fattiga-fann-trost-och-kraft-i-moas-bocker/ | publisher=LRF Media | access-date=19 November 2015 | website=www.minnenasjournal.nu | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120050436/http://minnenasjournal.nu/fattiga-fann-trost-och-kraft-i-moas-bocker/ | archive-date=20 November 2015}}</ref> In October that year, she was also writing for ''[[Tidevarvet]]'' (''The Epoch'') which was a politically radical magazine for women published by the [[Kvinnliga medborgarskolan vid Fogelstad|Fogelstad Citizen School for Women]] with [[Elin Wägner]] as editor. Her first contribution was an article about unemployed men's women. She wrote it under a new signature, Moa, because she did not want the syndicalistic circles she moved in to see that she worked for a liberal magazine. However, her work for ''Tidevarvet'' was mostly novels and stories and her political articles were still published in the syndicalistic press.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=106}} She had found the name "Moa" in the novel ''Jökeln'' (''Bræen'') by Danish author [[Johannes V. Jensen]], where the character "Moa" was described as the [[Mother goddess|first mother]] of humanity.<ref name=berattelsen group=w />

In November 1927, Martinson traveled to [[Gothenburg]] at the request of chief editor Welinder at the ''Arbetare-kuriren''. She was hoping to be offered a job at the paper, but instead Welinder wanted her to work as a housemaid for him and do some writing for the magazine in exchange for food and shelter in his house. Martinson turned down the offer.<ref name=berattelsen group=w /> While she was at the editorial office, she met [[Harry Martinson]] for the first time. He was a former sailor,<ref name=minnernas group=w /> now [[hobo]] writer who had been published in ''Brand'' and ''Arbetare-kuriren'' so she had heard of him and read some of his works.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=115}}

== Johansson's death ==
Shortly after Martinson's return to Johannesdal, her husband was afflicted by a nervous disorder. He started hallucinating and could not eat or sleep. She tried to get him to a doctor but he refused. On 14{{nbsp}}January 1928, Johansson committed suicide by putting a stick of [[dynamite]] in his mouth and lighting the [[Fuse (explosives)|fuse]].<ref name=minnernas group=w /> By then, Martinson had considered divorcing him for a long time since theirs had not been an easy marriage. After Johansson's death her economic situation was difficult. Martinson's friends in Stockholm started a fund-raising and manage to collect [[Swedish krona|SEK]] 3,300 to ease her financial situation. Having lost two sons and one husband, she became very depressed. In March 1928, she took a [[Typewriter|typing]] course at the Fogelstad Citizen School for Women and when she left the school it was as "Moa".{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=118}}
During her stay at Fogelstad, she received a letter from Harry Martinson, who asked if he could come and stay for a while at the torp in Johannesdal so he could work. He arrived in the summer of 1928.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=120}}

== Second marriage ==
During the summer of 1928, Martinson and Harry fell in love. However, in 1928–1929 she became more depressed and in March 1929, she was hospitalized at [[Södertälje]] hospital. During Martinson's stay in the hospital, Harry lived at Johannesdal and they communicated through letters.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=140}} On 3{{nbsp}}October 1929, they got married. Shortly thereafter, in May 1930, Harry was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]] leaving Martinson devastated.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=149}}

[[File:20120807084529!Martinson, Harry i VJ 1943.jpg|thumb|Harry Martinson in 1943]]
The couple had very little money so in 1932, Martinson sent a draft called ''En man byggde'' ("''A man built''") to publisher Tor Bonnier. She continued to develop the draft during the following year and when it was finalized into a book, the title was changed to ''Kvinnor och Äppleträd''. It was published in 1933, and the author was named as "Moa Martinson".{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=182}} Because of the timing and the theme, the book was categorized as "[[Literary modernism|modernist literature]]".{{sfn|Witt-Brattström|1988|p=51}} This became Martinson's literary debut and it gained a lot of attention. Simultaneously, Harry was diagnosed with [[neurosis]] and Martinson was deeply concerned for him. He was fourteen years younger than she, and their marriage had not been easy.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=182}} As writers, they also had very different styles. While Martinson was characterized as an unpolished [[Literary realism|realist]], Harry was a refined [[Literary modernism|modernist]].<ref name="kirjasto" group=w />

During the winter of 1933, their financial situation improved and they rented an apartment in [[Saltsjöbaden]] in the hope of solving their marriage problems. At the beginning of 1934 Harry suffered from depression. Up until then, he had never stayed in one place for such a long time as he had done with Martinson at Johannesdal. He started to leave the apartment now and then without any explanation of why or where he was going, and would be gone for days. Harry's friends blamed Martinson for his disappearance, and there were even those who believed that she was to blame for both his physical and mental pain. Not knowing where her husband was, Martinson soon became desperate with despair and jealousy. She even hired a [[Private investigator|private detective]], but when this yielded nothing, she soon gave up. Unknown to Martinson, Harry had started to see a new woman during his time away from home. According to Engman, the name of the woman was Karin L., and another source, Söderberg, speaks of a love affair with poet [[Karin Boye]] and several other women.{{sfn|Söderblom|1994|p=75}} In the summer of 1934, Harry confessed that he had been seeing another woman but said that he had ended the affair. Martinson became furious, but she forgave him.{{sfn|Engman|2004|pp=192–196}}

However, Harry's affair with Karin was not over and the same summer they traveled to [[Tällberg]] in [[Dalarna]]. Harry told Martinson that he needed to be alone and that it would be good for them to be apart for a while. After a couple of weeks, Harry grew tired of Karin and returned to Johannesdal. During the last years of their marriage, he continued  to wander off now and then from Martinson and Johannesdal.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=198}}

=== Decline and divorce ===
On 6{{nbsp}}June 1934, Harry abruptly left Martinson and the house in Johannesdal and took to the road again, leaving behind the manuscript for ''[[Flowering Nettle]]'' (''Nässlorna blomma''). When he had been gone ten days, Martinson posted a personal telegram on the [[Sveriges Radio|Swedish radio]]{{efn|Before the event of mobile phones, the Swedish Radio provided a service of reading "personal telegrams" (''personligt telegram'') as well as "wanted" notices from the police, on the radio in connection to some of the newscasts.<ref group=w>{{cite web|last=Samuelsson|first=MarieLouise|title=Radiokrönikan: Utrikeskorrar i radion|trans-title=Radio chronicles: Foreign correspondents on the radio|date=26 June 2007|url=http://www.dn.se/diverse/diverse-hem/radiokronikan-utrikeskorrar-i-radion/|publisher=[[Dagens Nyheter]]|website=www.dn.se|access-date=28 January 2016}}</ref><ref group=w>{{cite web|last=Viktorin|first=Magnus|title=Hallåmannen – din lots i etern|trans-title=The announcer – your guide through the airwaves|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/avsnitt/295087?programid=2702|date=28 December 2013|publisher=[[Sveriges Radio]]|website=www.sverigesradio.se|access-date=28 January 2016}}</ref>}} urging him to come home. With the announcement, Harry's flight{{sic}} became public and the story circulated in the newspapers. The couple kept in contact indirectly through their publishers and friends. On 2{{nbsp}}August, Martinsson wrote to Harry that she was going to commit suicide and that the manuscript was going to follow her to the grave. She had buried the manuscript in the woods. The letter reached Harry while he worked his passage aboard a ship to Rottedam. A week later, he was back home in Johannesdal and he, Martinson and one of their sons dug up the manuscript.{{sfn|Söderblom|1994|pp=84–85}}

In August 1934, the couple were invited to the first [[Union of Soviet Writers|All Union Congress of Soviet Writers]] in [[Moscow]] as part of the Swedish delegation. Gorky became the first chairman of the congress during which the new doctrine of [[Socialist realism]] was formed.<ref name="kirjasto" group=w /> Martinson became fascinated by the communist society, while Harry was appalled by [[Stalin's cult of personality]].{{sfn|Andersson|2003|p=137}}{{sfn|Söderblom|1994|p=75}}

In the autumn of 1935, the tension between Martinson and Harry seemed to have disappeared. She was working on ''Mor gifter sig''.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=214}} In 1937, she decided to leave the [[Albert Bonniers förlag|Bonnier publishing company]]. Instead she joined the Tidens publisher which was owned by the Swedish social democratic party. Martinson decided to leave because she had been having disagreements with Tor Bonnier since 1934. He was one of the Bonnier-founder's two grandsons who jointly ran the company at the time. Her choice of Tidens was also partly due to political reasons. Starting with a collection of poems called ''Motsols'' ("''Counterclockwise''"), Martinson's works were now published by Tidens. She had been working on ''Motsols'' for ten years. It consisted of poems about politics, love and nature.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=217}}

During the 1930s, Martinson experienced severe stomach pains. Despite several diagnoses made by different doctors, no remedy could be found and the pain continued. In June 1937, she was hospitalized at the [[Södertälje]] hospital where it was discovered that [[Shotgun shell#Buckshot|buckshots]] had accumulated in her [[Appendix (anatomy)|appendix]]. She had an operation on 16{{nbsp}}June and during her stay at the hospital, she and Harry kept in contact through letters. Harry's were love letters, while Martinson still found it difficult to trust him after his extramarital affairs. Her letters were not as affectionate as his and their relationship was crumbling.{{sfn|Engman|2004|pp=219–221}} On 8{{nbsp}}February 1939, Harry experienced [[Knee effusion|pain in one of his knees]] and was hospitalized. He stayed in the hospital during spring and was discharged on 13{{nbsp}}June, after which he went to Stockholm and stayed with friends. He broke contact with Martinson and after [[Midsummer#Sweden|Midsummer]] 1939, he filed for divorce and never returned to her or Johannesdal.{{sfn|Söderblom|1994|p=158}}{{sfn|Engman|2004|pp=228–230}} They were granted [[Decree nisi|legal separation]] on 4{{nbsp}}March 1940,{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=236}} and divorced in 1941.{{sfn|Söderblom|1994|p=367}} By then Harry was already engaged to his second wife Ingrid Lagercrantz.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=236}} They were married until Harry committed suicide on 11{{nbsp}}February 1978 at the [[Karolinska University Hospital]] in Stockholm by cutting his stomach open with a pair of scissors in what has been described as a "[[Seppuku|hara-kiri]]-like manner", due to a depression following a controversy regarding the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] he received in 1974.<ref name=AH group=w>{{cite web|last1=Hansson|first1=Anita|title=Martinson begick harakiri|trans-title=Martinson committed hara-kiri|url=http://wwwc.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/0008/31/harakiri.html|website=wwwc.aftonbladet.se|date=31 August 2000|publisher=[[Aftonbladet]]|access-date=29 January 2016}}</ref>{{sfn|Gyllensten|2000}}

The marriage between Martinson and Harry is recounted in the [[memoir]]s ''Tröskeln'' ("''The Threshold''") (1982) by their friend Swedish writer [[Ivar Lo-Johansson]].{{sfn|Lo-Johansson|1982}} She also relied on Lo-Johansson to deliver messages to Harry when he was out on his wanderings and his whereabouts were unknown to her.<ref name="kirjasto" group=w />

== Later life and death ==
[[File:Moa Martinson 1956.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Moa Martinson in 1956]]
Over six years Martinson had published eight books and had gained most critics' respect. In September 1939, [[World War II]] broke out, which she saw as the biggest threat to the working class. In her opinion, the non-socialist ruling countries were sending out workers to fight for values they did not share. When it came to [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Soviet participation]] in the war, Martinson had a different opinion and believed that Russian workers were defending their revolution.{{sfn|Engman|2004|pp=231–236}}

In order to make more money and avoid loneliness Martinson entered a new area, the film industry. She had help from her friend, actress [[Naima Wifstrand]]. Martinson wrote a lengthy [[screenplay]] that she sent to director [[Per Lindberg]], who became interested. She proposed that they would contact [[AB Svensk Filmindustri]] (SF). However, Martinson's ambitions were too big and when she demanded an advance and an answer straight away, SF showed no interest.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=236}}

In the autumn of 1942, she met Karl Gunnarsson, whom she had first encountered in 1910 when she worked as a pantry chef at the Elfkarleö Hotel, south of [[Gävle]]. Gunnarsson was a writer too and the meeting with him reminded Martinson of her youth during the 1910s and the move to Johannesdal. Her memories were given shape in a love novel called ''Den osynlige älskaren'' ("''The Invisible Lover''").{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=248}}

During the 1940s, Martinson became known in Sweden as "the Mother of the People". Her books were reaching a wide audience and she now had readers who could identify with the environment she was portraying, instead of people being shocked by her naturalistic scenes. She wrote diligently and had causerie and debate articles published in several daily and weekly papers. She was also frequently hired to give lectures and traveled the country on different tours. In 1944, she made her radio debut. Because of her strong personality, what she said and did caused attention, and she became a role model for many women in Sweden and most of all for women in the working class.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=254}}

In November 1954, Martinson's mother Kristina Swartz died at the age of 83. Their relationship had been very strong, and Martinson's mother had been a big influence and inspiration for her work.{{sfn|Engman|2004|p=281}} In ''My Mother Gets Married'', she characterized Swartz as her best and most trusted friend.<ref name="kirjasto" group=w /> At that time, Martinson's literary reputation was low as it had decreased throughout the years. When her health became worse in the 60s, she stopped writing. However, despite her low reputation as a writer, Martinson still meant a lot to working class women. Even though her health was deteriorating, she still enjoyed debating and never stopped expressing her feelings.{{sfn|Engman|2004|pp=280–283}}

On 5{{nbsp}}August 1964, Martinson died at 73 years of age in [[Sorunda]].<ref name=nynas group=w>{{cite web|title=Johannesdal – Moas torp|trans-title="Johannesdal – Moa's torp|url=http://www.nynashamn.se/Uppleva-se-och-gora/Kultur-och-sevardheter/Fornlamningar-och-kulturmiljoer/Moa-Martinson.html|website=www.nynashamn.se|publisher=[[Nynäshamn Municipality]]|access-date=17 November 2015}}</ref> She is buried at Sorunda Church.<ref name=visitnynas group=w />

== Legacy ==
During the 1970s, Martinson became a role model for female writers during the [[Feminism|feminist]] movement in the [[Nordic countries]].<ref name="kirjasto" group=w /> Earlier, during the 1960s, she had been labeled "the cheerful chronicler of misery" by Swedish author Erik Hjalmar Linder.{{sfn|Tigerstedt|Linder|1965}}

{{quote|"Paradoxically enough, I am mostly indignant not because I was denied the possibility to get a university education, but because I landed right in the same anonymous hell as my mother. Maybe it was even harder for me, for I was fully conscious that it was hell. I was clear about the injustice against all of us, and powerless."|From foreword for ''My Mother Gets Married''{{sfn|Martinson|1988}}}}

In 1989, a literary award named after Martinson was instituted by the [[Arbetarnas bildningsförbund|Workers' Educational Association]] (''Arbetarnas bildningsförbund'', ABF) and the Moa Martinson Society. The [[Arbetarnas bildningsförbund#Moa Award|Moa Award]] (''Moa-priset'') is an annual prize awarded to a person who writes in the spirit of Martinson.<ref group=w>{{cite news|title=Kristina Sandberg vinner Moa-priset|trans-title=Kristina Sandberg wins the Moa Award|date=9 January 2015|url=http://www.svd.se/kristina-sandberg-vinner-moa-priset|newspaper=Svenska Dagbladet|publisher=[[Svenska Dagbladet]]|access-date=23 February 2016}}</ref><ref group=w>{{cite web|title=Förteckning över Moastipendiater|trans-title=List of Moa stipends|url=http://www.moamartinson.se/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=55:foerteckning-oever-moastipendiater&catid=25:saellskapet&Itemid=37|website=www.moamartinson.se|access-date=23 February 2016}}</ref>
