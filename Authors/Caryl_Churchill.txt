==Early life and education==
Churchill was born on 3 September 1938 in [[Finsbury]], [[London]], the daughter of Jan Brown, a fashion model and actress,<ref name=":0">{{cite book |last=Tycer |first=Alicia |title=Caryl Churchill's Top Girls: Modern Theatre Guides |publisher=Continuum |year=2008 |isbn=9780826495563 |location=London / New York |pages=1–23}}</ref> and Robert Churchill, a political cartoonist.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/35/Caryl-Churchill.html |title=Caryl Churchill Biography (1938-) |website=Filmreference.com |access-date=27 January 2018}}</ref> After the [[Second World War]] her family emigrated to [[Montreal]], Canada; Churchill was ten years old. In Montreal, she attended [[Trafalgar School for Girls]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Churchill, Caryl, (Mrs David Harter), (born 3 Sept. 1938), playwright|url=https://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/10.1093/ww/9780199540884.001.0001/ww-9780199540884-e-10931|access-date=2021-09-03|website=WHO'S WHO & WHO WAS WHO|year=2007|language=en|doi=10.1093/ww/9780199540884.013.U10931|isbn=978-0-19-954088-4}}</ref>

She returned to England to attend university in 1956,<ref name=":0" /> and in 1960 graduated from [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford]], with a BA degree in [[English Literature]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/Alumni/Prominent-alumni.aspx |title=LMH, Oxford – Prominent Alumni |website=Lmh.ox.ac.uk |access-date=20 May 2015}}</ref> She received the Richard Hillary Memorial Prize at Oxford and also began her writing career there. Her four earliest plays, ''Downstairs'' (produced 1958),''You've No Need to be Frightened'', ''Having a Wonderful Time'' (1960), and ''Easy Death'' (produced 1962) were performed at Oxford by student theatre ensembles.<ref name="doollee.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.doollee.com/PlaywrightsC/churchill-caryl.html |title=The playwrights database of modern plays |website=Doollee.com |access-date=27 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230080744/http://www.doollee.com/PlaywrightsC/churchill-caryl.html |archive-date=30 December 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref> One of her plays, ''Downstairs'' was performed at the [[National Student Drama Festival]] in 1958 and won the first prize.

==Work==
While raising a family in the 1960s and 1970s, Churchill began to write short radio dramas for [[BBC Radio]]. These included ''The Ants'' (1962), ''Not, Not, Not, Not Enough Oxygen'' (1971), and ''Schreber's Nervous Illness'' (1972). She also wrote television plays for the BBC, including ''[[The After-Dinner Joke]]'' (1978) and ''Crimes'' (1982). These, as well as some of her [[radio plays]], have been adapted for the stage.<ref name=britannica/>

{{BLP unsourced section|date=January 2018}}
In her early work Churchill explored [[gender]] and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] through modernist theatre techniques of [[Epic theatre]]. In the mid-1980s she started to incorporate [[Dance Theatre|dance-theatre]] in her writing. ''[[A Mouthful of Birds]]'' (1986) is the first example of this, and references the surrealist theatre tradition of [[Antonin Artaud]] and the [[Theatre of Cruelty]]. The fragmented and [[surrealistic]] narratives in Churchill's work characterises her work as [[Postmodern theater|postmodernist]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/85149.Caryl_Churchill |title=Caryl Churchill |website=www.goodreads.com |access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>

===Themes and plays===
{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2018}}
In 1972, she wrote ''[[Owners (Play)|Owners]]'', a two-act, 14-scene play about obsession with power. It was her first professionally produced stage play and "her first major theatrical endeavour"; it was produced in London the same year.<ref name=britannica/>

She served as resident dramatist at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] from 1974 to 1975, and was the Royal Court's first female playwright in residence.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Black |first1=Joseph |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I6ZaDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA914 |title=The Broadview Anthology of British Literature Volume 6B: The Twentieth Century and Beyond: From 1945 to the Twenty-First Century |last2=Conolly |first2=Leonard |last3=Flint |first3=Kate |last4=Grundy |first4=Isobel |last5=LePan |first5=Don |last6=Liuzza |first6=Roy |last7=McGann |first7=Jerome J. |last8=Prescott |first8=Anne Lake |last9=Qualls |first9=Barry V. |date=2008-05-22 |publisher=Broadview Press |pages=914 |isbn=978-1-55111-924-3}}</ref> She began collaboration with theatre companies such as the [[Joint Stock Theatre Company]] and the [[Monstrous Regiment Theatre Company]] (a [[feminist theatre]] collective). Both used an extended workshop period in their development of new plays.<ref>{{cite book |editor=Clark, Susan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s0KeDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT393 |title=Classic Plays by Women: From 1600 to 2000 |last1=Hrotswitha |last2=Cary |first2=Elizabeth |last3=Behn |first3=Aphra |last4=Centlivre |first4=Susanna |last5=Baillie |first5=Joanna |last6=Sowerby |first6=Githa |last7=Bagnold |first7=Enid |last8=Churchill |first8=Caryl |last9=Jones |first9=Marie |date=2019-04-02 |publisher=Aurora Metro Publications Ltd. |isbn=978-1-910798-78-2}}</ref> Churchill continues to use an [[improvisation]]al workshop period in developing a number of her plays. During this period, she also wrote ''Objections to Sex and Violence'' (1974).<ref name=britannica/>

Her first play to receive wide notice was ''[[Cloud Nine (play)|Cloud Nine]]'' (1979), "a farce about sexual politics", set partly in a British overseas colony during the [[Victorian era]]. It explores the effects of the [[colonialist]]/[[imperialist]] mindset on intimate personal relationships, and uses cross-gender casting for comic and instructive effect. The play became successful in Britain and in the United States, winning an [[Obie Award]] in 1982 for best play of the year in New York.<ref name=britannica/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.obieawards.com/events/1980s/year-82/ |title=82 |website=Obie Awards |access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>

Churchill gradually abandoned more conventions of [[Realism (theatre)|realism]], with her loyalty to feminist themes and ideas becoming a guiding principle in her work. She won an [[Obie Award]] for best play in 1983 with ''[[Top Girls]]'', "which deals with women's losing their humanity in order to attain power in a male-dominated environment."<ref name=britannica/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.obieawards.com/events/1980s/year-83/ |title=83 |website=Obie Awards |access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref> It features an all-female cast, and focuses on Marlene, who has relinquished a home and family to achieve success in the world of business. Half the action takes place at a celebratory dinner where Marlene mixes with historical, iconic and fictional women who have achieved great stature in a "man's world", but always at great cost. The other half of the play, set a year in the past, focuses on Marlene's family, where the true cost of her "successful" life becomes poignantly and frighteningly apparent. In ''Top Girls'', Churchill devised a system to indicate how the dialogue should be performed. She used the forward dash signal (/) to demonstrate a person interrupting the person speaking. She also used the asterisk symbol (*) to indicate a speech following on from a speech earlier than the one immediately before it.<ref>{{cite book |title=Top Girls |last=Churchill |first=Caryl |publisher=Methuen London Ltd |year=1982 |isbn=978-0573630231 |location=London |pages=Front |url=https://archive.org/details/topgirls0000chur}}</ref>

''Softcops'' (first produced by the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] in 1984), is a "surreal play set in 19th-century France about government attempts to depoliticize illegal acts".<ref name=britannica/> [[Justin Hayford]] of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' wrote that the play had little to offer to those who had already read [[Michel Foucault]]'s ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' (on which ''Softcops'' is based), and that the play "glosses Foucault's monumental work in Cliffs Notes fashion".<ref>{{cite news |last=Hayford |first=Justin |date=1997-07-31 |title=Softcops |work=Chicago Reader |url=https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/softcops/Content?oid=894045 |access-date=2020-05-10}}</ref> In 2018, Michael Billington stated that ''Softcops'' "felt like a meditation on crime and punishment lacking Churchill's usual gift of narrative drive."<ref name=Billington>{{cite news |last=Billington |first=Michael |date=2018-09-02 |title=Caryl Churchill at 80: theatre's great disruptor |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/sep/02/caryl-churchill-at-80-theatre-great-disruptor |access-date=2020-05-10 |issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

The play ''[[A Mouthful of Birds]]'' (1986) was co-written with [[David Lan]]. [[Wallace Shawn]] has argued that it is among the "rich, inventive" Churchill works that are responsible for theater remaining exciting in modern times.<ref>{{cite news |last=Ravenhill |first=Mark |date=2008-09-02 |title=Mark Ravenhill on the genius of playwright Caryl Churchill, 70 this week |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/sep/03/carylchurchill.theatre |access-date=2020-05-10 |issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Cameron Woodhead of ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' billed the play as "a difficult pleasure to watch and a challenge to perform".<ref>{{cite web |title=A Mouthful of Birds |url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/theatre/a-mouthful-of-birds-20111103-1mxpe.html |last=Woodhead |first=Cameron |date=2011-11-04 |website=The Sydney Morning Herald |access-date=2020-05-10}}</ref> Billington listed ''A Mouthful of Birds'' as one of Churchill's misfires, however, and dismissed the play as "mystifying in its attempt to create a dance-drama suggesting that the violence and ecstasy of Euripides' ''[[The Bacchae]]'' were alive in modern Britain."<ref name=Billington/>

''[[Serious Money]]'' (1987), "a comedy about excesses in the financial world",<ref name=britannica/> is a verse play, chiefly written in rhyming couplets. It takes a [[satirical]] look at the vagaries of the [[stock market]] and its Thatcherite denizens. The play was highly acclaimed, perhaps in part because it played immediately after the [[stock market crash]] of 1987.<ref name=britannica/> ''Icecream'' ([[Royal Court Theatre]] 1989) explores Anglo-American stereotypes.<ref name=britannica/> Richard Christensen of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' wrote that ''Icecream'' "doesn't have much depth, but it does have a quirky, creepy kick to it", describing it as "a small but telling piece of theater".<ref>{{cite news |title='Ice Cream' A Chillng, Though Funny Concoction |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1990-07-04-9002230777-story.html |last=Christiansen |first=Richard |date=1990-07-04 |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |access-date=2020-05-11}}</ref> Andrew Dickson of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' dubbed the play "wryly picaresque" in 2015.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Caryl Churchill's Prophetic Drama |url=https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/caryl-churchills-prophetic-drama |last=Dickson |first=Andrew |magazine=The New Yorker |access-date=2020-05-11}}</ref>

Churchill's play ''[[The Skriker]]'' (1994) includes distorted language, references to English folktales, and evocations of modern urban life. The Skriker is an ancient shape-shifting fairy and death portent in a search for revenge and love.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dramaonlinelibrary.com/plays/the-skriker-iid-153894 |title=The Skriker - Drama Online |website=Drama Online |access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref> The play initially received lukewarm reviews from critics, but is now considered among Churchill's successes.

"The prolific Churchill continued to push boundaries into the late 1990s. In 1997 she collaborated with the composer Orlando Gough to create 'Hotel,' a choreographed opera or sung ballet set in a hotel room. Also that year her surrealistic short play 'This Is a Chair' was produced."<ref name=britannica/> Reviews of the London opening of ''Hotel'' were favorable, but with the first piece ("Eight Rooms") generally considered superior to the second ("Two Nights").<ref>{{cite book |last=Aston |first=Elaine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BTZtDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA110 |title=Caryl Churchill |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2018 |isbn=978-1-78694-251-7 |pages=110}}</ref> In 2015, [[Moira Buffini]] of ''The Guardian'' listed ''This Is a Chair'' as one of Churchill's best works, stating that it "shows a real humility about the political inadequacy of playwrights."<ref>{{cite news |last=Buffini |first=Moira |date=2015-06-29 |title=Caryl Churchill: the playwright's finest hours |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/jun/29/caryl-churchill-the-playwrights-finest-hours |access-date=2020-05-16 |issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

Her 2002 play, ''[[A Number]]'', addresses the subject of [[human cloning]] and questions of identity. Churchill received an Obie Award in 2005 for this play.<ref name=":1">{{cite web |url=https://www.obieawards.com/events/2000s/year-05/ |title=05 |website=Obie Awards |access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref> Her adapted screenplay of ''A Number'' was shown on BBC TV in September 2008.

The play ''[[Drunk Enough to Say I Love You?]]'' (2006) takes a critical look at what she sees as Britain's submission to the United States in foreign policy.

In 2010, Churchill was commissioned to write the [[libretto]] for a new short opera by [[Orlando Gough]], as part of the [[Royal Opera House]]'s ROH2 OperaShots initiative.  The resulting work, ''A ring a lamp a thing'', played for five performances in the Linbury Studio Theatre at the Royal Opera House.<ref>O'Mahony, John. [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/jun/10/ingerland-operashots-gough-pook-sawhney "Operas about wags? Why not, says the Royal Opera House"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 10 June 2010.</ref>

Her ''[[Love and Information]]'', opened at the Royal Court Theatre in September 2012, directed by [[James Macdonald (director)|James Macdonald]]. It was well-received by critics. The play, featuring 100 characters and performed by a cast of 15, is structured as a series of more than 50 fragmented scenes, some no longer than 25 seconds, all of which are apparently unrelated but which accumulate into a startling mosaic, a portrayal of modern consciousness and the need for human intimacy, love and connection. The play will have its regional premiere at Sheffield Theatres in June 2018, directed by Caroline Steinbeis.

''Ding Dong the Wicked'' (2013) has been described as a companion piece to ''Love and Information''. Charles Spencer said in ''The Telegraph'' that the work is "little more than a clever dramatic exercise" but "nags away in the memory long after you have left the theatre".<ref>{{cite news |last=Spencer |first=Charles |date=2012-10-09 |title=Ding Dong the Wicked, Royal Court Theatre, review |work=The Telegraph |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-reviews/9594624/Ding-Dong-the-Wicked-Royal-Court-Theatre-review.html |access-date=2020-06-04 |issn=0307-1235}}</ref> Matthew Tucker gave the [[Royal Court Theatre]] performance three out of five stars, dubbed the play "snappy", and wrote, "Some may find this latest offering terse and obscure, however, in the spirit of explorative theatre, ''Ding Dong The Wicked'' is an intriguing and satisfying production."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Tucker|first=Matthew|date=2012-10-11|title=Ding Dong The Wicked (REVIEW): The Perils Of Patriotism And Folly Of War|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/10/10/ding-dong-the-wicked-review_n_1956042.html|access-date=2020-06-04|website=HuffPost UK}}</ref> A reviewer for the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' argued, "What it all means is food for later reflection, but as always Churchill seems inventive, coolly socialist, bleak yet dazzling, a bit of a shaman.

In short, the play is too generalised to make any strong emotional impact."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Billington|first=Michael|date=2012-10-05|title=Ding Dong the Wicked – review |work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/oct/05/ding-dong-the-wicked-review|access-date=2020-06-04|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>
