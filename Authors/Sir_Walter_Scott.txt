'''Sir Walter Scott, 1st Baronet''' {{postnominals|country=UK|FRSE}} {{post-nominals|list=[[Society of Antiquaries of Scotland#Fellowship|FSAScot]]}} (15 August 1771 – 21 September 1832), was a Scottish historical novelist, poet, playwright and historian. Many works remain classics of European and [[Scottish literature]], notably the novels ''[[Ivanhoe]]'', ''[[Rob Roy (novel)|Rob Roy]]'', ''[[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]]'', ''[[Old Mortality]]'', ''[[The Heart of Mid-Lothian]]'' and ''[[The Bride of Lammermoor]]'', and the narrative poems ''[[The Lady of the Lake (poem)|The Lady of the Lake]]'' and  ''[[Marmion (poem)|Marmion]]''. He had a major impact on European and American literature. As an advocate, judge and legal administrator by profession, he combined writing and editing with daily work as [[Clerk of Session]] and [[Sheriff court|Sheriff-Depute]] of [[Selkirkshire]]. He was prominent in Edinburgh's [[Tory (political faction)|Tory]] establishment, active in the [[Royal Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland|Highland Society]], long a president of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] (1820–1832), and a vice president of the [[Society of Antiquaries of Scotland]] (1827–1829).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.socantscot.org/resources/famous-fellows/ |title=Famous Fellows |publisher=Society of Antiquaries of Scotland |access-date=18 January 2019}}</ref> His knowledge of history and literary facility equipped him to establish the historical novel genre and as an exemplar of European [[Romanticism]]. He became a [[baronet]] "of [[Abbotsford House|Abbotsford]] in the [[County of Roxburgh]]", Scotland, on 22 April 1820; the title became extinct on his son's death in 1847.

==Early life==
Walter Scott was born on 15 August 1771, in a third-floor apartment on College Wynd in the [[Old Town, Edinburgh|Old Town]], Edinburgh, a narrow alleyway leading from the [[Cowgate]] to the gates of the [[University of Edinburgh]] (Old College).<ref name="homes">{{Cite web |last=Edinburgh University Library  |title=Homes of Sir Walter Scott |url=http://www.walterscott.lib.ed.ac.uk/biography/homes.html |publisher=[[Edinburgh University Library]] |date=22 October 2004 |access-date=9 July 2013}}</ref> He was the ninth child (six having died in infancy) of Walter Scott (1729–1799), a member of a cadet branch of the [[Clan Scott]] and a [[Society of Writers to Her Majesty's Signet|Writer to the Signet]], by his wife Anne Rutherford, a sister of [[Daniel Rutherford]] and a descendant of both the [[Clan Swinton]] and the Haliburton family (the descent from which granted Walter's family the hereditary right of burial in [[Dryburgh Abbey]]).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.walterscott.lib.ed.ac.uk/biography/origins.html |title=Family Background |website=Walter Scott |publisher=Edinburgh University Library |date=24 October 2003}}</ref> Walter was thus a cousin of the property developer [[James Burton (property developer)|James Burton]] (died 1837), born "Haliburton", and of his son the architect [[Decimus Burton]].<ref name="BSLS">{{Cite web |title=Who were the Burtons |url=http://www.burtonsstleonardssociety.co.uk/history_-_the_burtons.html |website=The Burtons' St Leonards Society |access-date=18 September 2017}}</ref> Walter subsequently became a member of the [[Clarence Club]], of which the Burtons were also members.<ref name="Life and Letters p. 55">{{Cite book |last=Beattie |first=William |title=Life and Letters of Thomas Campbell, In Three Volumes, Volume II |year=1849 |publisher=Edward Moxon, Dover Street, London |page=55}}</ref><ref name="Athenaeum">{{Cite book |title=The Athenaeum, Volume 3, Issues 115–165 |year=1830 |publisher=J.

In 1778, Scott returned to Edinburgh for private education to prepare him for school and joined his family in their new house, one of the first to be built in [[George Square, Edinburgh|George Square]].<ref name="homes"/> In October 1779, he began at the [[Royal High School (Edinburgh)|Royal High School]] in Edinburgh (in High School Yards). He was by then well able to walk and explore the city and the surrounding countryside. His reading included chivalric romances, poems, history and travel books. He was given private tuition by James Mitchell in arithmetic and writing, and learned from him the history of the [[Church of Scotland]] with emphasis on the [[Covenanters]]. In 1783, his parents, believing he had outgrown his strength, sent him to stay for six months with his aunt Jenny at [[Kelso, Scottish Borders|Kelso]] in the Scottish Borders: there he attended [[Kelso High School (Scotland)|Kelso Grammar School]], where he met [[James Ballantyne]] and his brother [[John Ballantyne (publisher)|John]], who later became his business partners and printers.<ref name=uni>{{Cite web |url=http://www.walterscott.lib.ed.ac.uk/biography/education.html |title=School and University |publisher=Walterscott.lib.ed.ac.uk |date=24 October 2003 |access-date=29 November 2009}}</ref>

===Appearance===
As a result of his early polio infection, Scott had a pronounced limp. He was described in 1820 as "tall, well formed (except for one ankle and foot which made him walk lamely), neither fat nor thin, with forehead very high, nose short, upper lip long and face rather fleshy, complexion fresh and clear, eyes very blue, shrewd and penetrating, with hair now silvery white".<ref>C. R. Leslie, 1855. "Letter to Miss C Leslie dated 26 June 1820" in [https://archive.org/details/gri_33125007592757 ''Autobiographical recollections'']. ed. Tom Taylor, Ticknor & Fields, Boston.</ref> Although a determined walker, he experienced greater freedom of movement on horseback.

==Student==
Scott began studying classics at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in November 1783, at the age of 12, a year or so younger than most fellow students. In March 1786, aged 14, he began an apprenticeship in his father's office to become a [[Writer to the Signet]]. At school and university Scott had become a friend of [[Adam Ferguson (British Army officer)|Adam Ferguson]], whose father Professor [[Adam Ferguson]] hosted literary salons.<ref>[[#CITEREFLockhart1852|Lockhart]], pp. 378–379.</ref> Scott met the blind poet [[Thomas Blacklock]], who lent him books and introduced him to the [[Ossian]] cycle of poems by [[James Macpherson]]. During the winter of 1786–1787, a 15-year-old Scott met the Scots poet [[Robert Burns]] at one of these salons, their only meeting. When Burns noticed a print illustrating the poem "The Justice of the Peace" and asked who had written it, Scott alone named the author as [[John Langhorne (poet)|John Langhorne]] and was thanked by Burns. Scott describes the event in his memoirs, where he whispers the answer to his friend [[Adam Ferguson (British Army officer)|Adam]], who tells Burns;<ref>[[#CITEREFLockhart1852|Lockhart]], p. 38.</ref> another version of the event appears in ''Literary Beginnings''.<ref name=lit>{{Cite web |url=http://www.walterscott.lib.ed.ac.uk/biography/beginning.html |title=Literary Beginnings |publisher=Walterscott.lib.ed.ac.uk |date=11 December 2007 |access-date=29 November 2009}}</ref> When it was decided that he would become a lawyer, he returned to the university to study law, first taking classes in moral philosophy (under [[Dugald Stewart]]) and universal history (under [[Alexander Fraser Tytler, Lord Woodhouselee|Alexander Fraser Tytler]]) in 1789–1790.<ref Name=uni/> During this second university spell Scott became prominent in student intellectual activities: he co-founded the Literary Society in 1789 and was elected to the Speculative Society the following year, becoming librarian and secretary-treasurer a year after.<ref name=hewitt>Hewitt, David (2004) "Scott, Sir Walter (1771–1832)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''. {{DOI|10.1093/ref:odnb/24928}}</ref>

After completing his law studies, Scott took up law in Edinburgh. He made his first visit as a lawyer's clerk to the Scottish Highlands, directing an eviction. He was admitted to the [[Faculty of Advocates]] in 1792. He had an unsuccessful love suit with Williamina Belsches of Fettercairn, who married Scott's friend [[William Forbes, 7th Baronet|Sir William Forbes, 7th Baronet]]. In February 1797, the threat of a French invasion persuaded Scott and many of his friends to join the [[British Volunteer Corps|Royal Edinburgh Volunteer Light Dragoons]], where he served into the early 1800s,<ref>J. G. Lockhart,  1872. [https://archive.org/details/lockhartslifeofs00lock/page/n11/mode/2up The Life Of Scott]. Ch. 2.</ref> and was appointed [[quartermaster]] and secretary. The daily drill practices that year, starting at 5 a.m., indicate the determination with which the role was undertaken.

==Literary career, marriage and family==
[[File:Scott's Minstrelsy Of The Scottish Border.JPG|thumb|A copy of Scott's ''Minstrelsy'', in the National Museum of Scotland]]
Scott was prompted to take up a literary career by enthusiasm in Edinburgh in the 1790s for modern German literature. Recalling the period in 1827, Scott said that he "was German-mad."<ref>''The Letters of Sir Walter Scott': 1826‒1828'', ed. H. J. C. Grierson (London, 1936), p. 331: Scott to Mrs Hughes.</ref> In 1796, he produced English versions of two poems by [[Gottfried August Bürger]], ''Der wilde Jäger'' and ''Lenore'', published as ''The Chase, and William and Helen''. Scott responded to the German interest at the time in national identity, folk culture and medieval literature,<ref name="hewitt"/> which linked with his own developing passion for traditional balladry. A favourite book since childhood had been [[Thomas Percy (bishop of Dromore)|Thomas Percy]]'s ''[[Reliques of Ancient English Poetry]]''. During the 1790s he would search in manuscript collections and on Border "raids" for ballads from oral performance. With help from [[John Leyden]], he produced a two-volume ''Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border'' in 1802, containing 48 traditional ballads and two imitations apiece by Leyden and himself. Of the 48 traditionals, 26 were published for the first time. An enlarged edition appeared in three volumes the following year. With many of the ballads, Scott fused different versions into more coherent texts, a practice he later repudiated.<ref name="hewitt"/> The ''Minstrelsy'' was the first and most important of a series of editorial projects over the next two decades, including the medieval romance ''[[Sir Tristrem]]'' (which Scott attributed to [[Thomas the Rhymer]]) in 1804, the works of [[John Dryden]] (18 vols, 1808), and the works of [[Jonathan Swift]] (19 vols, 1814).

On a trip to the English [[Lake District]] with old college friends, he met Charlotte Charpentier (Anglicised to "Carpenter"), a daughter of Jean Charpentier of [[Lyon]] in France and a [[wardship|ward]] of Lord Downshire in [[Cumberland]], an Anglican. After three weeks' courtship, Scott proposed and they were married on Christmas Eve 1797 in St Mary's Church, Carlisle (now the nave of [[Carlisle Cathedral]]).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.walterscott.lib.ed.ac.uk/biography/marriage.html |title=Williamina, Charlotte and Marriage |publisher=University of Edinburgh |date=24 October 2003 |access-date=31 October 2017}}</ref> After renting a house in Edinburgh's [[George Street, Edinburgh|George Street]], they moved to nearby South Castle Street. Their eldest child, Sophia, was born in 1799, and later married John Gibson Lockhart.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Abbotsford - The Home of Sir Walter Scott|url=https://www.scottsabbotsford.com/history/the-descendants-of-sir-walter-scott/scotts-children|access-date=2021-11-19|website=www.scottsabbotsford.com}}</ref> Four of their five children survived Scott himself. His eldest son [[Scott baronets|Sir Walter Scott, 2nd Baronet]] (1801–1847), inherited his father's estates and possessions: on 3 February 1825<ref>Monuments and monumental inscriptions in Scotland: The Grampian Society, 1871.</ref> he married Jane Jobson, only daughter of William Jobson of Lochore (died 1822) by his wife Rachel Stuart (died 1863), heiress of [[Lochore]] and a niece of Lady Margaret Ferguson.<ref>C. S. M. Lockhart, 1871 [https://archive.org/details/centenarymemori00lockgoog ''The Centenary Memorial of Sir Walter Scott'']. Virtue & Co. p. 62.</ref> In 1799 Scott was appointed [[Sheriff Court|Sheriff-Depute]] of the [[County of Selkirk]], based in the [[Royal Burgh]] of [[Selkirk, Scottish Borders|Selkirk]]. In his early married days Scott earned a decent living from his work as a lawyer, his salary as Sheriff-Depute, his wife's income, some revenue from his writing, and his share of his father's modest estate.

[[File:39 North Castle Street, Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|left|Right to left: numbers 39, 41 and 43 North Castle Street, Edinburgh. No 39 was the home of Sir Walter Scott from 1801]]
After the younger Walter was born in 1801, the Scotts moved to a spacious three-storey house at 39 North Castle Street, which remained his Edinburgh base until 1826, when it was sold by the trustees appointed after his financial ruin. From 1798, Scott had spent summers in a cottage at [[Lasswade]], where he entertained guests, including literary figures. It was there his career as an author began. There were nominal residency requirements for his position of Sheriff-Depute, and at first he stayed at a local inn during the circuit. In 1804, he ended his use of the Lasswade cottage and leased the substantial house of [[Ashiestiel|Ashestiel]], {{convert|6|mi|km}} from Selkirk, sited on the south bank of the [[River Tweed]] and incorporating an ancient [[tower house]].<ref name="homes"/>

At Scott's insistence the first edition of ''Minstrelsy'' was printed by his friend James Ballantyne at Kelso. In 1798 James had published Scott's version of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s ''[[Erlkönig]]'' in his newspaper ''The Kelso Mail'', and in 1799 included it and the two Bürger translations in a privately printed anthology, ''Apology for Tales of Terror''. In 1800 Scott suggested that Ballantyne set up business in Edinburgh and provided a loan for him to make the transition in 1802. In 1805, they became partners in the printing business, and from then until the financial crash of 1826 Scott's works were routinely printed by the firm.<ref>[[#Johnson|Johnson]], p. 171.</ref><ref name=hewitt/><ref>Sharon Ragaz, 2004.

==The poet==
[[File:Sir William Allan - Sir Walter Scott, 1771 - 1832. Novelist and poet - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Sir Walter Scott, novelist and poet – painted by [[Sir William Allan]] ]]
Between 1805 and 1817 Scott produced five long, six-canto narrative poems, four shorter independently published poems, and many small metrical pieces. Scott was by far the most popular poet of the time until [[Lord Byron]] published the first two cantos of ''[[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage]]'' in 1812 and followed them up with his exotic oriental verse narratives.

''[[The Lay of the Last Minstrel]]'' (1805), in medieval romance form, grew out of Scott's plan to include a long original poem of his own in the second edition of the ''Minstrelsy'': it was to be "a sort of Romance of Border Chivalry & inchantment".<ref>''The Letters of Sir Walter Scott: 1787‒1807'', ed. [[H. J. C. Grierson]] (London, 1932), 166 (Scott to [[Anna Seward]], 30 November 1802).</ref> He owed the distinctive irregular accent in four-beat metre to [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]]'s ''[[Christabel (poem)|Christabel]]'', which he had heard recited by [[John Stoddart]]. (It was not to be published until 1816).<ref>[[#Johnson|Johnson]], p. 197.</ref> Scott was able to draw on his unrivalled familiarity with Border history and legend acquired from oral and written sources beginning in his childhood to present an energetic and highly coloured picture of 16th-century Scotland, which both captivated the general public and with its voluminous notes also addressed itself to the antiquarian student. The poem has a strong moral theme, as human pride is placed in the context of the last judgment with the introduction of a version of the "[[Dies irae]]" at the end. The work was an immediate success with almost all the reviewers and with readers in general, going through five editions in one year.<ref name=hewitt/> 
The most celebrated lines are the ones that open the final stanza: 
{{Quote|<poem>
Breathes there the man, with soul so dead,
Who never to himself hath said,
  This is my own, my native land!
Whose heart hath ne'er within him burned,
As home his footsteps he hath turned,
  From wandering on a foreign strand!—
If such there breathe, go, mark him well;
For him no minstrel raptures swell.</poem>}}

Three years after ''The Lay'' Scott published ''[[Marmion (poem)|Marmion]]'' (1808) telling a story of corrupt passions leading up as a disastrous climax to the [[Battle of Flodden]] in 1513. The main innovation involves prefacing each of the six cantos with an epistle from the author to a friend: [[William Stewart Rose]], The Rev. [[John Marriott (poet)|John Marriot]], [[William Erskine, Lord Kinneder|William Erskine]], [[James Skene]], [[George Ellis (poet)|George Ellis]], and [[Richard Heber]]: the epistles develop themes of moral positives and special delights imparted by art. In an unprecedented move, the publisher [[Archibald Constable]] purchased the copyright of the poem for a thousand guineas at the beginning of 1807, when only the first had been completed.<ref>Walter Scott, 2018. ''Marmion: A Tale of Flodden Field'', ed. Ainsley McIntosh. Edinburgh. pp. 292‒93. {{ISBN|978-1717020321}}</ref> Constable's faith was justified by the sales: the three editions published in 1808 sold 8,000 copies. The verse of ''Marmion'' is less striking than that of ''The Lay'', with the epistles in iambic tetrameters and the narrative in tetrameters with frequent trimeters. The reception by the reviewers was less favourable than that accorded ''The Lay'': style and plot were both found faulty, the epistles did not link up with the narrative, there was too much antiquarian pedantry, and Marmion's character was immoral.<ref>J. H. Alexander, 1976. ''Two Studies in Romantic Reviewing'', Vol. 2. Salzburg. pp. 358‒369. {{ISBN|0773401296}}</ref> The most familiar lines in the poem sum up one of its main themes: "O what a tangled web we weave,/ When first we practice to deceive"<ref>Canto 6, stanza 17 (6.766‒67).</ref>

Scott's meteoric poetic career peaked with his third long narrative, ''The Lady of the Lake'' (1810), which sold 20,000 copies in the first year.<ref name=hewitt/> The reviewers were fairly favourable, finding the defects noted in ''Marmion'' largely absent.<ref>J. H. Alexander, 1976. ''Two Studies in Romantic Reviewing'', Vol. 2. Salzburg. pp. 369‒380. {{ISBN|0773401296}}</ref> In some ways it is more conventional than its predecessors: the narrative is entirely in iambic tetrameters and the story of the transparently disguised [[James V of Scotland|James V]] (King of Scots 1513‒42) predictable: Coleridge wrote to [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]]: 'The movement of the Poem... is between a sleeping Canter and a Marketwoman's trot – but it is endless – I seem never to have made any way – I never remember a narrative poem in which I felt the sense of Progress so languid."<ref>''Collected Letters of Samuel Taylor Coleridge: Volume 3 1807‒1814'', ed. Earl Leslie Griggs. Oxford. 1959. p. 808 (early October 1810).</ref> But the metrical uniformity is relieved by frequent songs and the Perthshire Highland setting is presented as an enchanted landscape, which caused a phenomenal increase in the local tourist trade.<ref>''The Letters of Sir Walter Scott: 1808‒1811'', ed. H. J. C. Grierson. London. 1932. 419n.</ref> Moreover, the poem touches on a theme that was to be central to the Waverley Novels: the clash between neighbouring societies in different stages of development.<ref name=hewitt/>

The remaining two long narrative poems, ''[[Rokeby (poem)|Rokeby]]'' (1813), set in the [[Yorkshire]] estate of that name belonging to Scott's friend [[John Bacon Sawrey Morritt|J. B. S. Morritt]] during the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] period, and ''[[The Lord of the Isles]]'' (1815), set in early 14th-century Scotland and culminating in the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] in 1314. Both works had generally favourable receptions and sold well, but without rivalling the huge success of ''The Lady of the Lake''. Scott also produced four minor narrative or semi-narrative poems between 1811 and 1817: [[The Vision of Don Roderick]] (1811, celebrating Wellington's successes in the Peninsular Campaign, with profits donated to Portuguese war sufferers);<ref>''The Romantics Part III, S–Z'', No. 25, London: Jarndyce Antiquarian Booksellers, 2021.</ref> ''[[The Bridal of Triermain]]'' (published anonymously in 1813); ''[[The Field of Waterloo]]'' (1815); and ''[[Harold the Dauntless]]'' (published anonymously in 1817).

Throughout his creative life Scott was an active reviewer. Although himself a Tory he reviewed for ''[[Edinburgh Review|The Edinburgh Review]]'' between 1803 and 1806, but that journal's advocacy of peace with Napoleon led him to cancel his subscription in 1808. The following year, at the height of his poetic career, he was instrumental in establishing a Tory rival, ''[[Quarterly Review|The Quarterly Review]]'' to which he contributed reviews for the rest of his life.<ref>[[#Johnson|Johnson]], pp. 299‒300.</ref><ref>William B.

In 1813 Scott was offered the position of [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]]. He declined, feeling that "such an appointment would be a poisoned chalice," as the Laureateship had fallen into disrepute due to the decline in quality of work suffered by previous title holders, "as a succession of poetasters had churned out conventional and obsequious odes on royal occasions."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.walterscott.lib.ed.ac.uk/biography/poet.html |title=Scott the Poet |website=www.walterscott.lib.ed.ac.uk}}</ref> He sought advice from the [[Charles Montagu-Scott, 4th Duke of Buccleuch|4th Duke of Buccleuch]], who counselled him to retain his literary independence. The position went to Scott's friend, [[Robert Southey]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.walterscott.lib.ed.ac.uk/biography/poet.html |title=Scott the Poet |publisher=Walterscott.lib.ed.ac.uk |date=11 December 2007 |access-date=29 November 2009}}</ref>

===Gothic novel===
That Scott was influenced by [[Gothic romance]], and had collaborated in 1801 with [[Matthew Lewis (writer)|'Monk' Lewis]] on ''Tales of Wonder''.<ref name="The Bloomsbury Guide p. 885">''The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature'', ed. Marion Wynne Davis. New York: Prentice Hall, 1990, p.&nbsp;885.</ref><ref>See also, Robert Letellier, ''Sir Walter Scott and the Gothic Novel''. Lewiston, New York:Mellen Pess, 1995.</ref>

===Historic romances===
Scott's career as a novelist was attended with uncertainty. The first few chapters of ''Waverley'' were complete by roughly 1805, but the project was abandoned as a result of unfavourable criticism from a friend. Soon after, Scott was asked by the publisher John Murray to posthumously edit and complete the last chapter of an unfinished romance by Joseph Strutt. Published in 1808 and set in 15th-century England, ''Queenhoo Hall'' was not a success due to its archaic language and excessive display of antiquarian information.<ref>Walter Scott, 1889. ''Waverley Novels Centenary Edition Vol. I'', "General Preface, 1829." Edinburgh: Adam and Charles Black.</ref> The success of his Highland narrative poem ''The Lady of the Lake'' in 1810 seems to have put it into his head to resume the narrative and have his hero Edward Waverley journey to Scotland. Although ''Waverley'' was announced for publication at that stage, it was again laid by and not resumed until late 1813, then published in 1814.<ref>Walter Scott, 2007. ''Waverley'', ed. P. D. Garside. Edinburgh University Press. pp. 367‒383. {{ISBN|0748605673}}</ref> Only a thousand copies were printed, but the work was an immediate success and 3,000 more were added in two further editions the same year. ''Waverley'' turned out to be the first of 27 novels (eight published in pairs), and by the time the sixth of them, ''Rob Roy'', was published, the print run for the first edition had been increased to 10,000 copies, which became the norm.

Given Scott's established status as a poet and the tentative nature of ''Waverley'''s emergence, it is not surprising that he followed a common practice in the period and published it anonymously. He continued this until his financial ruin in 1826, the novels mostly appearing as 'By the Author of Waverley' (or variants thereof) or as ''Tales of My Landlord''. It is not clear why he chose to do this (no fewer than eleven reasons have been suggested),<ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://scholarcommons.sc.edu/ssl/vol10/iss4/3/ |author=Cooney, Seamus |title=Scott's Anonymity—Its Motive and Consequences |journal=Studies in Scottish Literature |volume=10 |year=1973 |pages=207‒19}}</ref> especially as it was a fairly open secret, but as he himself said, with [[Shylock]], "such was my humour."<ref>Walter Scott, 2012.

Scott was an almost exclusively historical novelist. Only one of his 27 novels – ''Saint Ronan's Well'' – has a wholly modern setting. The settings of the others range from 1794 in ''[[The Antiquary]]'' back to 1096 or 1097, the time of the [[First Crusade]], in ''[[Count Robert of Paris]]''. Sixteen take place in Scotland. The first nine, from ''Waverley'' (1814) to ''[[A Legend of Montrose]]'' (1819), all have Scottish locations and 17th or 18th-century settings. Scott was better versed in his material than anyone: he could draw on oral tradition and a wide range of written sources in his ever-expanding library (many of the books rare and some unique copies).<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Levy, Lindsay |title="Long life to thy fame and peace to thy soul": Walter Scott's Collection of Robert Burns's Books and Manuscripts |journal=Scottish Archives |volume=16 |year=2010 |pages=32‒40 (34)}}</ref><ref>Lindsay Levy, 2012. "Was Sir Walter Scott a Bibliomaniac?", in ''From Compositors to Collectors: Essays on Book-Trade History'', ed. John Hinks and Matthew Day. New Castle, Delaware. pp. 309‒321. {{ISBN|9780712358729}}</ref> In general it is these pre-1820 novels that have drawn the attention of modern critics – especially: ''Waverley'', with its presentation of the [[Jacobite rising of 1745|1745 Jacobites]] drawn from the Highland clans as obsolete and fanatical idealists; ''Old Mortality'' (1816) with its treatment of the 1679 Covenanters as fanatical and often ridiculous (prompting [[John Galt (novelist)|John Galt]] to produce a contrasting picture in his novel ''Ringan Gilhaize'' in 1823); ''The Heart of Mid-Lothian'' (1818) with its low-born heroine Jeanie Deans making a perilous journey to Windsor in 1737 to secure a promised royal pardon for her sister, falsely accused of infanticide; and the tragic ''The Bride of Lammermoor'' (1819), with its stern account of a declined aristocratic family, with Edgar Ravenswood and his fiancée as victims of the wife of an upstart lawyer in a time of political power-struggle before the [[Acts of Union 1707|Act of Union]] in 1707.

In 1820, in a bold move, Scott shifted period and location for ''Ivanhoe'' (1820) to 12th-century England. This meant he was dependent on a limited range of sources, all of them printed: he had to bring together material from different centuries and invent an artificial form of speech based on Elizabethan and Jacobean drama. The result is as much myth as history, but the novel remains his best-known work, the most likely to be found by the general reader. Eight of the subsequent 17 novels also have medieval settings, though most are set towards the end of the era, for which Scott had a better supply of contemporaneous sources. His familiarity with Elizabethan and 17th-century English literature, partly resulting from editorial work on pamphlets and other minor publications, meant that four of his works set in the England of that period – ''[[Kenilworth (novel)|Kenilworth]]'' (1821), ''[[The Fortunes of Nigel]]'' and ''[[Peveril of the Peak]]'' (1821), and ''[[Woodstock (novel)|Woodstock]]'' (1826) – present rich pictures of their societies. The most generally esteemed of Scott's later fictions, though, are three short stories: a supernatural narrative in Scots, "Wandering Willie's Tale" in ''[[Redgauntlet]]'' (1824), and "The Highland Widow" and "The Two Drovers" in ''[[Chronicles of the Canongate]]'' (1827).

Crucial to Scott's historical thinking is the concept that very different societies can move through the same stages as they develop, and that humanity is basically unchanging, or as he puts it in the first chapter of ''Waverley'' that there are "passions common to men in all stages of society, and which have alike agitated the human heart, whether it throbbed under the steel corslet of the fifteenth century, the brocaded coat of the eighteenth, or the blue frock and white dimity waistcoat of the present day." It was one of Scott's main achievements to give lively, detailed pictures of different stages of Scottish, British, and European society while making it clear that for all the differences in form, they took the same human passions as those of his own age.<ref>Graham McMaster, 1981. ''Scott and Society''. Cambridge University Press. Ch. 2 "Scott and the Enlightenment". {{ISBN|9780521237697}}</ref> His readers could therefore appreciate the depiction of an unfamiliar society, while having no difficulty in relating to the characters.

Scott is fascinated by striking moments of transition between stages in societies. Coleridge, in a discussion of his early novels, found that they derive their "long-sustained ''interest''" from "the contest between the two great moving Principles of social Humanity – religious adherence to the Past and the Ancient, the Desire & the admiration of Permanence, on the one hand; and the Passion for increase of Knowledge, for Truth as the offspring of Reason, in short, the mighty Instincts of ''Progression'' and ''Free-agency'', on the other."<ref>''Collected Letters of Samuel Taylor Coleridge'', ed. Earl Leslie Griggs, 6 vols (Oxford, 1956‒71), 5.34‒35: Coleridge to [[Thomas Allsop]], 8 April 1820.</ref> This is clear, for example, in ''Waverley'', as the hero is captivated by the romantic allure of the Jacobite cause embodied in [[Bonnie Prince Charlie]] and his followers before accepting that the time for such enthusiasms has passed and accepting the more rational, humdrum reality of [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] Britain. Another example appears in 15th-century Europe in the yielding of the old chivalric world view of [[Charles the Bold|Charles Duke of Burgundy]] to the [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavellian]] pragmatism of [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]]. Scott is intrigued by the way different stages of societal development can exist side by side in one country. When Waverley has his first experience of Highland ways after a raid on his Lowland host's cattle, it "seemed like a dream&nbsp;... that these deeds of violence should be familiar to men's minds, and currently talked of, as falling with the common order of things, and happening daily in the immediate neighbourhood, without his having crossed the seas, and while he was yet in the otherwise well-ordered island of Great Britain."<ref>Walter Scott, 2007. ''Waverley'', ed. P. D. Garside. Edinburgh University Press. Ch. 16, p. 78. {{ISBN|0748605673}}</ref> A more complex version of this comes in Scott's second novel, ''[[Guy Mannering]]'' (1815), which "set in 1781‒2, offers no simple opposition: the Scotland represented in the novel is at once backward and advanced, traditional and modern – it is a country in varied stages of progression in which there are many social subsets, each with its own laws and customs."<ref name=hewitt/>

Scott's process of composition can be traced through the manuscripts (mostly preserved), the more fragmentary sets of proofs, his correspondence, and publisher's records.<ref>For an overview of the process see the revised "General Introduction" to the [[Edinburgh edition of the Waverley novels]] by David Hewitt, first published in 1997 in the ''Guy Mannering'' volume.</ref> He did not create detailed plans for his stories, and the remarks by the figure of "the Author" in the Introductory Epistle to ''The Fortunes of Nigel'' probably reflect his own experience: "I think there is a dæmon who seats himself on the feather of my pen when I begin to write, and leads it astray from the purpose. Characters expand under my hand; incidents are multiplied; the story lingers, while the materials increase – my regular mansion turns out a Gothic anomaly, and the work is complete long before I have attained the point I proposed." Yet the manuscripts rarely show major deletions or changes of direction, and Scott could clearly keep control of his narrative. That was important, for as soon as he had made fair progress with a novel he would start sending batches of manuscript to be copied (to preserve his anonymity), and the copies were sent to be set up in type. (As usual at the time, the compositors would supply the punctuation.) He received proofs, also in batches, and made many changes at that stage, but these were almost always local corrections and enhancements.

As the number of novels grew, they were republished in small collections: ''Novels and Tales'' (1819: ''Waverley'' to ''A Tale of Montrose''); ''Historical Romances'' (1822: ''Ivanhoe'' to ''Kenilworth''); ''Novels and Romances'' (1824 [1823]: ''[[The Pirate (novel)|The Pirate]]'' to ''[[Quentin Durward]]''); and two series of ''Tales and Romances'' (1827: ''St Ronan's Well'' to ''Woodstock''; 1833: ''Chronicles of the Canongate'' to ''[[Castle Dangerous]]''). In his last years Scott marked up interleaved copies of these collected editions to produce a final version of what were now officially the ''Waverley Novels'', often called his 'Magnum Opus' or 'Magnum Edition'. Scott provided each novel with an introduction and notes and made mostly piecemeal adjustments to the text. Issued in 48 smart monthly volumes between June 1829 and May 1833 at a modest price of five shillings (25p) these were an innovative and profitable venture aimed at a wide readership: the print run was an astonishing 30,000.<ref>Jane Millgate, 1987. ''Scott's Last Edition: A Study in Publishing History''. Edinburgh University Press. pp. 21 and 125 note 51. {{ISBN|0852245416}}</ref>

In a "General Preface" to the "Magnum Edition", Scott wrote that one factor prompting him to resume work on the ''Waverley'' manuscript in 1813 had been a desire to do for Scotland what had been done in the fiction of [[Maria Edgeworth]], "whose Irish characters have gone so far to make the English familiar with the character of their gay and kind-hearted neighbours of Ireland, that she may be truly said to have done more towards completing the Union, than perhaps all the legislative enactments by which it has been followed up [the [[Acts of Union 1801|Act of Union]] of 1801]."<ref>Walter Scott, 2012. "General Preface" in ''Introductions and Notes from The Magnum Opus: Waverley to A Legend of the Wars of Montrose'', ed. J. H. Alexander, P. D. Garside and Claire Lamont. Edinburgh University Press. p. 12. {{ISBN|0748605908}}</ref> Most of Scott's readers were English: with ''Quentin Durward'' (1823) and ''Woodstock'' (1826), for example, some 8000 of the 10,000 copies of the first edition went to London.<ref>Walter Scott, ''Quentin Durward'', ed. J. H. Alexander and G. A. M. Wood (Edinburgh, 2001), 408; Walter Scott, ''Woodstock'', ed. Tony Inglis (Edinburgh, 2009) 445.</ref> In the Scottish novels the lower-class characters normally speak Scots, but Scott is careful not to make the Scots too dense, so that those unfamiliar with it can follow the gist without understanding every word. Some have also argued that although Scott was formally a supporter of the Union with England (and Ireland) his novels have a strong nationalist subtext for readers attuned to that wavelength.<ref>Paul Scott, ''Walter Scott and Scotland'' (Edinburgh, 1981); Julian Meldon D'Arcy, ''Subversive Scott'' (Reykjavik, 2005).</ref>

Scott's new career as a novelist in 1814 did not mean he abandoned poetry. The Waverley Novels contain much original verse, including familiar songs such as "Proud Maisie" from ''The Heart of Mid-Lothian'' (Ch. 41) and "Look not thou on Beauty's charming" from ''The Bride of Lammermoor'', (Ch. 3). In most of the novels Scott preceded each chapter with an epigram or "motto"; most of these are in verse, and many are of his own composition, often imitating other writers such as [[Beaumont and Fletcher]].

==Recovery of the Crown Jewels, baronetcy, and ceremonial pageantry==
[[File:George IV landing at Leith.JPG|thumb|[[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] landing at [[Leith]] in 1822]]
Prompted by Scott, the Prince Regent (the future [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]]) gave Scott and other officials permission in a Royal Warrant dated 28 October 1817<ref>William Bell, 1829. [https://archive.org/details/papersrelativeto00bell ''Papers Relative to the Regalia of Scotland'']. Edinburgh. p. 6.</ref> to conduct a search for the Crown Jewels ("[[Honours of Scotland]]"). During the Protectorate under [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]] these had been hidden away, but had subsequently been used to crown [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]. They were not used to crown subsequent monarchs, but were regularly taken to sittings of Parliament, to represent the absent monarch, until the [[Act of Union 1707]]. So the honours were stored in Edinburgh Castle, but their large locked box was not opened for more than 100 years, and stories circulated that they had been "lost" or removed. On 4 February 1818,<ref>William Bell, 1829. [https://archive.org/details/papersrelativeto00bell ''Papers Relative to the Regalia of Scotland'']. Edinburgh. p. 9.</ref> Scott and a small military team opened the box and "unearthed" the honours from the Crown Room of [[Edinburgh Castle]]. On 19 August 1818 through Scott's effort, his friend [[Adam Ferguson (British Army officer)|Adam Ferguson]] was appointed Deputy Keeper of the "[[Honours of Scotland|Scottish Regalia]]".<ref>The Edinburgh Annual Register for 1818, Vol. 11 Appx. IV p. 227.</ref> The Scottish patronage system swung into action and after elaborate negotiations the Prince Regent granted Scott the title of [[baronet]]: in April 1820 he received the baronetcy in London, becoming Sir Walter Scott, 1st Baronet.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Garside |first1=Peter |title=Patriotism and Patronage: New Light on Scott's Baronetcy |journal=The Modern Language Review |volume=77 |issue=1 |year=1982 |pages=16–28 |jstor=3727490 |doi=10.2307/3727490}}</ref>

After George's accession, the [[city council of Edinburgh]] invited Scott, at the sovereign's behest, to stage-manage the 1822 [[visit of King George IV to Scotland]].<ref name="Walter Scott Chronology">{{Cite web |title=Chronology of Walter Scott's life |website=Walter Scott Digital Archive |url=http://www.walterscott.lib.ed.ac.uk/biography/chronology.html |access-date=2 May 2015}}</ref> With only three weeks to work with, Scott created a spectacular, comprehensive pageant, designed not only to impress the King, but in some way to heal the rifts that had destabilised Scots society. He used the event to contribute to drawing a line under an old world that pitched his homeland into regular bouts of bloody strife. Probably fortified by his vivid depiction of the pageant staged for the reception of Queen Elizabeth in ''Kenilworth'' he and his "production team" mounted what in modern days would be a [[Public relations|PR]] event, with the King dressed in [[tartan]] and greeted by his people, many of them also in similar tartan ceremonial dress. This form of dress, proscribed after the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]], became one of the seminal, potent and ubiquitous symbols of Scottish identity.<ref name="Walterscott.lib.ed.ac.uk">{{Cite web |url=http://www.walterscott.lib.ed.ac.uk/biography/chronology.html |title=Walter Scott Digital Archive – Chronology |publisher=Walterscott.lib.ed.ac.uk |date=13 October 2008 |access-date=29 November 2009}}</ref>

==Financial problems and death==
In 1825, a UK-wide [[panic of 1825|banking crisis]] resulted in the collapse of the Ballantyne printing business, of which Scott was the only partner with a financial interest. Its debts of [[Pound sterling|£]]130,000 ({{Inflation|UK|130000|1825|r=-5|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}) caused his very public ruin.<ref name="McKinstry2002">{{Cite journal |last1=McKinstry |first1=Sam |last2=Fletcher |first2=Marie |title=The Personal Account Books of Sir Walter Scott |journal=The Accounting Historians Journal |year=2002 |jstor=40698269 |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=59–89|doi=10.2308/0148-4184.29.2.59}}</ref> Rather than declare himself bankrupt or accept any financial support from his many supporters and admirers (including the King himself), he placed his house and income in a trust belonging to his creditors and set out to write his way out of debt. To add to his burdens, his wife Charlotte died in 1826.

Despite these events or because of them, Scott kept up his prodigious output. Between 1826 and 1832 he produced six novels, two short stories and two plays, eleven works or volumes of non-fiction, and a journal, along with several unfinished works. The non-fiction included the ''Life of Napoleon Buonaparte'' in 1827, two volumes of the ''History of Scotland'' in 1829 and 1830, and four instalments of the series entitled ''Tales of a Grandfather – Being Stories Taken From Scottish History'', written one per year over the period 1828–1831, among several others. Finally, Scott had recently been inspired by the diaries of [[Samuel Pepys]] and [[Lord Byron]], and he began keeping a journal over the period, which, however, would not be published until 1890, as ''[[The Journal of Sir Walter Scott]]''.

[[File:Walter Scott grave Dryburgh Abbey 20140527.jpg|thumb|Sir Walter Scott's grave at [[Dryburgh Abbey]] – the largest tomb is that of Sir Walter and Lady Scott. The engraved slab covers the grave of their son, Lt Col Sir Walter Scott. On the right is their son-in-law and biographer, [[John Gibson Lockhart]].]]
By then Scott's health was failing, and on 29 October 1831, in a vain search for improvement, he set off on a voyage to Malta and Naples on board HMS ''Barham'', a frigate put at his disposal by the Admiralty. He was welcomed and celebrated wherever he went, but on his journey home he had a final stroke and was transported back to die at Abbotsford on 21 September 1832.<ref>''London Medical and Surgical Journal'', January 1833</ref>  He was 61.

Scott was buried in [[Dryburgh Abbey]], where his wife had earlier been interred. Lady Scott had been buried as an Episcopalian; at Scott's own funeral, three ministers of the Church of Scotland officiated at Abbotsford and the service at Dryburgh was conducted by an Episcopal clergyman.<ref>Sefton, Henry R. (1983) "Scott as Churchman", ''Scott and his Influence''. Aberdeen. pp. 234–42 (241). {{ISBN|9780950262932}}</ref>

Although Scott died owing money, his novels continued to sell, and the debts encumbering his estate were discharged shortly after his death.<ref name="McKinstry2002" />

==Religion==
Scott was raised as a [[Presbyterian]] in the Church of Scotland. He was ordained as an elder in [[Duddingston Kirk]] in 1806,<ref name="Duddingston Kirk – Home">{{cite web |title=Duddingston Kirk – History and Buildings |website=Duddingston Kirk – Home |url=http://duddingstonkirk.co.uk/history_and_buildings.html |access-date=27 May 2019}}</ref> and sat in the General Assembly for a time as representative elder of the burgh of Selkirk. In adult life he also adhered to the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]]: he seldom attended church but read the [[Book of Common Prayer]] services in family worship.<ref>[[#CITEREFLockhart1852|Lockhart]], Vol. 2, pp. 186, 190.</ref>

==Freemasonry==
Scott's father was a Freemason, being a member of Lodge St David, No. 36 (Edinburgh), and Scott also became a Freemason in his father's Lodge in 1801,<ref>{{cite book|last=Mackey|first=Albert G.|title=Encyclopedia Of Freemasonry And Its Kindred Sciences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bxwlDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA36|volume=4 (S-Z)|publisher=Jazzybee Verlag|isbn=978-3-8496-8802-8|page=36}}</ref> albeit only after the death of his father.

When Scott was a boy, he sometimes travelled with his father from Selkirk to Melrose, where some of his novels are set. At a certain spot, the old gentleman would stop the carriage and take his son to a stone on the site of the [[Battle of Melrose]] (1526).<ref>[[#CITEREFLockhart1852|Lockhart]], p. 397</ref>

During the summers from 1804, Scott made his home at the large house of Ashestiel, on the south bank of the River Tweed, {{convert|6|mi|km}} north of Selkirk. When his lease on this property expired in 1811, he bought Cartley Hole Farm, downstream on the Tweed nearer Melrose. The farm had the nickname of "[[wikt:clarty|Clarty]] Hole", and Scott renamed it "Abbotsford" after a neighbouring ford used by the monks of [[Melrose Abbey]].<ref name=scottsabbotsford>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scottsabbotsford.com/|title=Abbotsford – The Home of Sir Walter Scott|website=www.scottsabbotsford.com|access-date=26 August 2019}}</ref> Following a modest enlargement of the original farmhouse in 1811–12, massive expansions took place in 1816–19 and 1822–24. Scott described the resulting building as 'a sort of romance in Architecture'<ref>Grierson, ''op. cit.'', 8.129: Scott to John Richardson, [November–December 1823].</ref> and 'a kind of Conundrum Castle to be sure'.<ref>''The Journal of Sir Walter Scott'', ed.

Panelling of oak and cedar and carved ceilings relieved by coats of arms in their correct colours added to the beauty of the house.<ref name=scottsabbotsford />{{verify citation|date=July 2013}}

It is estimated that the building cost Scott more than £25,000 ({{Inflation|UK|25000|1825|r=-5|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}). More land was purchased until Scott owned nearly {{convert|1000|acre|km2}}. In 1817 as part of the land purchases Scott bought the nearby mansion-house of Toftfield for his friend Adam Ferguson to live in along with his brothers and sisters and on which, at the ladies' request, he bestowed the name of Huntlyburn.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/200348630-huntlyburn-with-walled-garden-and-bothy-former-stables-cottage-and-mounting-block-leaderdale-and-melrose-ward#.W2gVjS2ZOS4 |publisher=British Listed Buildings|title= Huntlyburn; statement of interest|access-date=7 August 2018}}</ref> Ferguson commissioned [[David Wilkie (artist)|Sir David Wilkie]] to paint the Scott family<ref>McCunn, Florence (1910) ''Sir Walter Scott's friends''.

===Later assessment===
[[File:Portrait of Sir Walter Scott (4673840).jpg|thumb|upright|Sketch of Scott c.1800 by an unknown artist]]
Although he continued to be extremely popular and widely read, both at home and abroad,<ref>"…it would be difficult to name, from among both modern and ancient works, many read more widely and with greater pleasure than the historical novels of … Walter Scott." – [[Alessandro Manzoni]], ''On the Historical Novel''.</ref> Scott's critical reputation declined in the last half of the 19th century as serious writers turned from romanticism to realism, and Scott began to be regarded as an author suitable for children. This trend accelerated in the 20th century. For example, in his classic study  ''[[Aspects of the Novel]]'' (1927), [[E. M. Forster]] harshly criticized Scott's clumsy and slapdash writing style, "flat" characters, and thin plots. In contrast, the novels of Scott's contemporary [[Jane Austen]], once appreciated only by the discerning few (including, as it happened, Scott himself) rose steadily in critical esteem, though Austen, as a female writer, was still faulted for her narrow ("feminine") choice of subject matter, which, unlike Scott, avoided the grand historical themes traditionally viewed as masculine.

Nevertheless, Scott's importance as an innovator continued to be recognised. He was acclaimed as the inventor of the genre of the modern historical novel (which others trace to [[Jane Porter]], whose work in the genre predates Scott's) and the inspiration for enormous numbers of imitators and genre writers both in Britain and on the European continent. In the cultural sphere, Scott's Waverley novels played a significant part in the movement (begun with [[James Macpherson]]'s ''[[Ossian]]'' cycle) in rehabilitating the public perception of the [[Scottish Highlands]] and its culture, which had been formerly been viewed by the southern mind as a barbaric breeding ground of hill bandits, religious fanaticism, and [[Jacobitism|Jacobite risings]].

Scott served as chairman of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] and was also a member of the [[Royal Celtic Society]]. His own contribution to the reinvention of Scottish culture was enormous, even though his re-creations of the customs of the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] were fanciful at times. Through the medium of Scott's novels, the violent religious and political conflicts of the country's recent past could be seen as belonging to history—which Scott defined, as the subtitle of ''Waverley'' ("'Tis Sixty Years Since") indicates, as something that happened at least 60 years earlier. His advocacy of objectivity and moderation and his strong repudiation of political violence on either side also had a strong, though unspoken, contemporary resonance in an era when many conservative English speakers lived in mortal fear of a revolution in the French style on British soil. Scott's orchestration of [[Visit of King George IV to Scotland|King George IV's visit to Scotland]], in 1822, was a pivotal event intended to inspire a view of his home country that, in his view, accentuated the positive aspects of the past while allowing the age of quasi-medieval blood-letting to be put to rest, while envisioning a more useful, peaceful future.

After Scott's work had been essentially unstudied for many decades, a revival of critical interest began in the middle of the 20th century. While [[F. R. Leavis]] had disdained Scott, seeing him as a thoroughly bad novelist and a thoroughly bad influence (''[[The Great Tradition]]'' [1948]), [[György Lukács]] (''The Historical Novel'' [1937, trans. 1962]) and [[David Daiches]] (''Scott's Achievement as a Novelist'' [1951]) offered a Marxian political reading of Scott's fiction that generated a great deal of genuine interest in his work. These were followed in 1966 by a major thematic analysis covering most of the novels by Francis R. Hart (''Scott's Novels: The Plotting of Historic Survival''). Scott has proved particularly responsive to [[Postmodern]] approaches, most notably to the concept of the interplay of multiple voices highlighted by [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], as suggested by the title of the volume with selected papers from the Fourth International Scott Conference held in Edinburgh in 1991, ''Scott in Carnival''. Scott is now increasingly recognised not only as the principal inventor of the historical novel and a key figure in the development of Scottish and world literature, but also as a writer of a depth and subtlety who challenges his readers as well as entertaining them.

During his lifetime, Scott's portrait was painted by Sir [[Edwin Landseer]] and fellow Scots Sir [[Henry Raeburn]] and [[James Eckford Lauder]]. In Edinburgh, the 61.1-metre-tall [[Victorian Gothic]] spire of the [[Scott Monument]] was designed by [[George Meikle Kemp]]. It was completed in 1844, 12 years after Scott's death, and dominates the south side of [[Princes Street]]. Scott is also commemorated on a stone slab in [[Makars' Court]], outside The Writers' Museum, [[Lawnmarket]], Edinburgh, along with other prominent Scottish writers; quotes from his work are also visible on the [[Canongate]] Wall of the [[Scottish Parliament building]] in [[Holyrood, Edinburgh|Holyrood]]. There is a tower dedicated to his memory on [[Corstorphine Hill]] in the west of the city and Edinburgh's Waverley railway station, opened in 1854, takes its name from his first novel.

In [[Glasgow]], [[public statues in Glasgow#George Square|Walter Scott's Monument]] dominates the centre of [[George Square]], the main public square in the city. Designed by [[David Rhind]] in 1838, the monument features a large column topped by a statue of Scott.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/143263/details/glasgow+george+square+walter+scott+s+monument/|title=Glasgow, George Square, Walter Scott's Monument|access-date=9 April 2011}}</ref>

Numerous Masonic Lodges have been named after Scott and his novels. For example: Lodge Sir Walter Scott, No. 859 ([[Perth, Australia]]) and Lodge Waverley, No. 597, (Edinburgh, Scotland).<ref>Grand Lodge of Scotland Year Book. 2014. pp 25 & 34. {{ISBN|0902324-86-1}}</ref>

The annual [[Walter Scott Prize for Historical Fiction]] was created in 2010 by the [[Duke of Buccleuch|Duke and Duchess of Buccleuch]], whose ancestors were closely linked to Sir Walter Scott. At £25,000, it is one of the largest prizes in British literature. The award has been presented at Scott's historic home, Abbotsford House.

Scott has been credited with rescuing the [[Banknotes of the pound sterling|Scottish banknote]]. In 1826, there was outrage in Scotland at the attempt of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] to prevent the production of banknotes of less than five pounds. Scott wrote a series of letters to the ''Edinburgh Weekly Journal'' under the pseudonym "''[[Malachi Malagrowther]]''" for retaining the right of Scottish banks to issue their own banknotes. This provoked such a response that the Government was forced to relent and allow the Scottish banks to continue printing pound notes. This campaign is commemorated by his continued appearance on the front of all notes issued by the [[Bank of Scotland]]. The image on the 2007 series of banknotes is based on the portrait by [[Henry Raeburn]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scotbanks.org.uk/banknotes/bank-of-scotland.html|title=Bank of Scotland|website=www.scotbanks.org.uk}}</ref>

During and immediately after World War I there was a movement spearheaded by [[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson]] and other eminent people to [[Effect of World War I on children in the United States|inculcate patriotism in American school children]], especially immigrants, and to stress the American connection with the literature and institutions of the "mother country" of Great Britain, using selected readings in middle school textbooks.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/americanidealss00pelogoog|title=American Ideals: Selected Patriotic Readings for Seventh and Eighth Grades|author=Serl, Emma and Joseph Pelo, William |date=1919|publisher=The Gregg publishing company|others=New York Public Library}}</ref> Scott's ''Ivanhoe'' continued to be required reading for many American high school students until the end of the 1950s.

A bust of Scott is in the Hall of Heroes of the [[National Wallace Monument]] in [[Stirling]]. Twelve streets in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]] are named after Scott's books or characters.<ref>[https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/longform/streets The origins of all 651 street names in Vancouver]. CBC Canada</ref>

In [[The Inch, Edinburgh|The Inch]] district of Edinburgh, some 30 streets developed in the early 1950s are named for Scott (Sir Walter Scott Avenue) and for characters and places from his poems and novels. Examples include Saddletree Loan (after Bartoline Saddletree, a character in ''[[The Heart of Midlothian]]''), Hazelwood Grove (after Charles Hazelwood, a character in ''[[Guy Mannering]]'') and Redgauntlet Terrace (after the 1824 ''[[Redgauntlet|novel of that name]]'').<ref>{{cite book |last1=Harris |first1=Stuart |title=The Place Names of Edinburgh: Their Origins and History |date=2002 |publisher=Steve Savage Publishers |pages=323–324}}</ref>

==Influence==
===On novelists===
Walter Scott had an immense impact throughout Europe. "His historical fiction ... created for the first time a sense of the past as a place where people thought, felt and dressed differently".<ref>[http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/93115/ "Abstract": M. Pittock, ed., ''The Reception of Sir Walter Scott in Europe''. Series: The reception of British and Irish authors in Europe. Bloomsbury: London, 2014. ISBN 9781472535474]</ref> His historical romances "influenced [[Balzac]], [[Dostoevsky]], [[Flaubert]], [[Tolstoy]], [[Alexandre Dumas|Dumas]], [[Pushkin]], and many others; and his interpretation of history was seized on by [[Romantic nationalism|Romantic nationalists]], particularly in [[Eastern Europe]]".<ref>"Abstract": M. Pittock, ed., ''The Reception of Sir Walter Scott in Europe''.</ref> An early and "highly influential translations was that of [[Auguste Defauconpret| Defauconpret]] in France".<ref> "Abstract": M.

{{Wikisource|Landon in The Literary Gazette 1832/On Walter Scott|'On Walter Scott',<br /> a poem by L. E. L.}}
{{Wikisource|Letitia Elizabeth Landon (L. E. L.) in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1833/Walter Scott|'Sir Walter Scott',<br/>a poem by L. E. L.}}
[[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]] was a great admirer of Scott and, on his death, she wrote two tributes to him: ''On Walter Scott'' in the Literary Gazette, and ''Sir Walter Scott'' in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1833. Towards the end of her life she began a series called ''The Female Picture Gallery'' with a series of character analyses based on the women in Scott's works.

[[Alessandro Manzoni]]'s ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]]'' (1827) has similarities with Walter Scott's historic novel ''[[Ivanhoe]]'', although evidently distinct.<ref>From Georg Lukàcs, "The Historical Novel" (1969): "In Italy Scott found a successor who, though in a single, isolated work, nevertheless broadened his tendencies with superb originality, in some respect surpassing him. We refer, of course, to Manzoni's ''I Promessi Sposi'' (The Betrothed). Scott himself recognized Manzoni's greatness. When in Milan Manzoni told him that he was his pupil, Scott replied that in that case Manzoni's was his best work. It is, however, very characteristic that while Scott was able to write a profusion of novels about English and Scottish society, Manzoni confined himself to this single masterpiece."</ref>

In [[Charles Baudelaire]]'s ''[[La Fanfarlo]]'' (1847), poet Samuel Cramer says of Scott:
{{Quote|
Oh that tedious author, a dusty exhumer of chronicles! A fastidious mass of descriptions of bric-a-brac&nbsp;... and castoff things of every sort, armor, tableware, furniture, gothic inns, and melodramatic castles where lifeless mannequins stalk about, dressed in leotards.
}}
In the novella, however, Cramer proves as deluded a romantic as any hero in one of Scott's novels.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=390170|author= Heck, Francis S. |title=Baudelaire's La Fanfarlo: An Example of Romantic Irony|journal=The French Review|volume=49|issue= 3 |year=1976|pages=328–36}}</ref>

[[Emily Brontë]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' was influenced by the novels of Walter Scott.<ref>[[Elizabeth Gaskell]] ''[[The Life of Charlotte Brontë]]'', London: Smith, Elder & Co., 1857, p.104.</ref> In particular, according to [[Juliet Barker]], ''[[Rob Roy (novel)|Rob Roy]]'' (1819) had a significant influence, which, though "regarded as the archetypal Yorkshire novel ... owed as much, if not more, to Walter Scott's Border country". ''Rob Roy'' is set "in the wilds of [[Northumberland]], among the uncouth and quarrelsome squirearchical Osbaldistones", while Cathy Earnshaw "has strong similarities with Diana Vernon, who is equally out of place among her boorish relations" (Barker p.&nbsp;501).<ref>Ian Brinton. ''Bronte's Wuthering Heights Reader's Guides''. London : Continuum. 2010, p. 14. Quoting Barker, ''The Brontes''. London: Weidenfeld and Nicholas, 1994.</ref>

In [[Anne Brontë]]'s ''[[The Tenant of Wildfell Hall]]'' (1848) the narrator, Gilbert Markham, brings an elegantly bound copy of ''[[Marmion (poem)|Marmion]]'' as a present to the independent "tenant of Wildfell Hall" (Helen Graham) whom he is courting, and is mortified when she insists on paying for it.

The many other British novelists whom Scott influenced included [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]], [[Charles Kingsley]], and [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]. He also shaped children's writers like [[Charlotte Yonge]] and [[G. A. Henty]].<ref>"Abstract": James Watt, '"Sir Walter Scott and the Medievalist Novel". ''The Oxford Handbook of Victorian Medievalism'', ed. Joanne Parker and Corinna Wagner. Oxford University Press, 2020.</ref>

In a speech delivered at Salem, Massachusetts, on 6 January 1860, to raise money for the families of the executed abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] and his followers, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] calls Brown an example of true chivalry, which consists not in noble birth but in helping the weak and defenseless and declares that "Walter Scott would have delighted to draw his picture and trace his adventurous career."<ref>{{cite book|last=Sacks|first=Kenneth S.|title=Emerson: Political Writings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sQKrBwzSGLYC&pg=PA193|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-47269-2|page=193}}</ref>

In his 1870 memoir, ''Army Life in a Black Regiment'', New England abolitionist [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson]] (later editor of [[Emily Dickinson]]), described how he wrote down and preserved Negro spirituals or "shouts" while serving as a colonel in the [[First South Carolina Volunteers]], the first authorized Union Army regiment recruited from freedmen during the Civil War. He wrote that he was "a faithful student of the Scottish ballads, and had always envied Sir Walter the delight of tracing them out amid their own heather, and of writing them down piecemeal from the lips of aged crones."

According to Marx's daughter [[Eleanor Marx|Eleanor]], Scott was "an author to whom Karl Marx again and again returned, whom he admired and knew as well as he did Balzac and Fielding."<ref>S. S. Prawer, 1976. ''Karl Marx and World Literature''. Oxford University Press. p. 386. {{ISBN|9780192812483}}</ref>

[[Mark Twain]], in his 1883 ''[[Life on the Mississippi]]'', satirized the impact of Scott's writings, declaring with humorous hyperbole that Scott "had so large a hand in making Southern character, as it existed before the [[American Civil War|[American Civil] war]]" that he is "in great measure responsible for the war."<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/245/245.txt |title=Twain, Mark. "Life on the Mississippi", Chapter 46}}</ref> He goes on to coin the term "Sir Walter Scott disease", which he blames for the South's lack of advancement. Twain also targeted Scott in ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'', where he names a sinking boat the "Walter Scott" (1884); and, in ''[[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]'' (1889), the main character repeatedly utters "Great Scott!" as an oath; by the end of the book, however, he has become absorbed in the world of knights in armour, reflecting Twain's ambivalence on the topic.

The idyllic Cape Cod retreat of suffragists Verena Tarrant and Olive Chancellor in Henry James's ''[[The Bostonians]]'' (1886) is called Marmion, evoking what James considered the Quixotic idealism of such social reformers.

In ''[[To the Lighthouse]]'' by [[Virginia Woolf]], Mrs. Ramsey glances at her husband:
{{Quote|He was reading something that moved him very much&nbsp;... He was tossing the pages over. He was acting it – perhaps he was thinking himself the person in the book. She wondered what book it was. Oh, it was one of old Sir Walter's she saw, adjusting the shade of her lamp so that the light fell on her knitting. For Charles Tansley had been saying (she looked up as if she expected to hear the crash of books on the floor above) – had been saying that people don't read Scott any more. Then her husband thought, "That's what they'll say of me;" so he went and got one of those books&nbsp;... It fortified him. He clean forgot all the little rubs and digs of the evening... and his being so irritable with his wife and so touchy and minding when they passed his books over as if they didn't exist at all&nbsp;...[Scott's] feeling for straight forward simple things, these fishermen, the poor old crazed creature in [[Saunders Mucklebackit|Mucklebackit]]'s cottage [in ''[[The Antiquary]]''] made him feel so vigorous, so relieved of something that he felt roused and triumphant and could not choke back his tears. Raising the book a little to hide his face he let them fall and shook his head from side to side and forgot himself completely (but not one or two reflections about morality and French novels and English novels and Scott's hands being tied but his view perhaps being as true as the other view), forgot his own bothers and failures completely in poor Steenie's drowning and Mucklebackit's sorrow (that was Scott at his best) and the astonishing delight and feeling of vigor that it gave him. 
Well, let them improve upon that, he thought as he finished the chapter&nbsp;... The whole of life did not consist in going to bed with a woman, he thought, returning to Scott and Balzac, to the English novel and the French novel.}}

[[John Cowper Powys]] described Walter Scott's romances as "by far the most powerful literary influence of my life".<ref>''Autobiography'' (1934). London: Macdonald, 1967, p. 66.</ref> This can be seen particularly in his two historical novels, ''[[Porius: A Romance of the Dark Ages]]'', set during the end of [[Roman Britain#End of Roman rule|Roman rule in Britain]], and ''[[Owen Glendower (novel)|Owen Glendower]]''.<ref>W. J. Keith, ''Aspects of John Cowper Powys's Owen Glendower'', pp. 20–21</ref> 

In 1951, science-fiction author [[Isaac Asimov]] wrote ''[[Breeds There a Man...?]]'', a short story with a title alluding vividly to Scott's ''[[The Lay of the Last Minstrel]]'' (1805). In Harper Lee's ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'' (1960), the protagonist's brother is made to read Walter Scott's book ''[[Ivanhoe]]'' to the ailing Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose. In ''[[Mother Night]]'' (1961) by [[Kurt Vonnegut]] Jr., memoirist and playwright Howard W. Campbell Jr. prefaces his text with the six lines beginning "Breathes there the man..." In ''Knights of the Sea'' (2010) by Canadian author [[Paul Marlowe]], there are several references to ''[[Marmion (poem)|Marmion]]'', as well as an inn named after ''[[Ivanhoe]]'', and a fictitious Scott novel entitled ''The Beastmen of Glen Glammoch''.

===The other arts===
{{See|Opera in Scotland#Operas inspired by Walter Scott}}
Although Scott's own appreciation of music was basic, to say the least, he had a considerable influence on composers. Some 90 operas based to some extent on his poems and novels have been traced, the most celebrated being [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]]'s ''[[La donna del lago]]'' (1819, based on ''[[The Lady of the Lake]]'') and [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]]'s ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' (1835, based on ''[[The Bride of Lammermoor]]'').<ref>Mitchell, Jerome (1977) ''Walter Scott Operas''. University, Alabama.</ref><ref>Mitchell, Jerome (1996) ''More Scott Operas''. Lanham, Maryland.</ref> Others include Donizetti's 1829 opera ''[[Il castello di Kenilworth]]'' based on ''[[Kenilworth (novel)|Kenilworth]]'', [[Georges Bizet]]'s [[La jolie fille de Perth]] (1867, based on ''[[The Fair Maid of Perth]]''), and [[Arthur Sullivan]]'s ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'' (1891).

Many of Scott's songs were set to music by composers throughout the 19th century.<ref>Bibliography in Yonge, C. D. (1888) ''Life of Sir Walter Scott''. London.  pp. xxxiv‒xxxviii.</ref> Seven from ''The Lady of the Lake'' were set in German translations by [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], one of them being '[[Ellens dritter Gesang]]' popularly known as 'Schubert's ''Ave Maria'''. Three lyrics, also in translation, appear from [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] in his ''[[Twenty-Five Scottish Songs (Beethoven)|Twenty-Five Scottish Songs]]'', Op. 108. Other notable musical responses include three overtures: ''Waverley'' (1828) and ''Rob Roy'' (1831) by [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]], and ''The Land of the Mountain and the Flood'' (1887, alluding to ''The Lay of the Last Minstrel'') by [[Hamish MacCunn]]. "Hail to the Chief" from "The Lady of the Lake" was set to music around 1812 by the songwriter James Sanderson (c. 1769 – c. 1841). See the Wikipedia article "Hail to the Chief."

The Waverley Novels are full of eminently paintable scenes and many 19th-century artists responded to them. Among the outstanding paintings of Scott subjects are: [[Richard Parkes Bonington]]'s ''Amy Robsart and the Earl of Leicester'' (''c.'' 1827) from ''[[Kenilworth]]'' in the [[Ashmolean Museum]], Oxford;<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://collections.ashmolean.org/collection/search/per_page/25/offset/0/sort_by/date/object/46921 |title=Ashmolean Museum |access-date=8 June 2020}}</ref> [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]]'s ''L'Enlèvement de Rebecca'' (1846) from ''[[Ivanhoe]]'' in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York;<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/438814?searchField=ArtistCulture&amp;sortBy=Relevance&amp;when=A.D.+1800-1900&amp;ft=eugene+delacroix&amp;offset=0&amp;rpp=20&amp;pos=2 |title=Metropolitan Museum of Art |access-date=8 June 2020}}</ref> and [[John Everett Millais|Millais]]'s ''[[The Bride of Lammermoor]]'' (1878) in Bristol Museum and Art Gallery.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/the-bride-of-lammermoor-188794 |title=Bristol Museum and Art Gallery |access-date=8 June 2020}}</ref>
