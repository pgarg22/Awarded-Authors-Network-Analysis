'''Charles Montagu Doughty''' (19 August 1843 – 20 January 1926) was an [[England|English]] poet, writer, explorer, adventurer and traveller, best known for his two-volume 1888 travel book ''[[Travels in Arabia Deserta]]''.

==Early life and education==
Son of Rev. Charles Montagu Doughty, of [[Theberton|Theberton Hall]] near [[Saxmundham]], Suffolk, and Frederica Beaumont Hotham, daughter of Rev. the Hon. Frederick Hotham, of [[Dennington]], [[Suffolk]] (son of the judge and politician [[Beaumont Hotham, 2nd Baron Hotham]]), Doughty was born at Theberton Hall and educated at private schools in [[Laleham]] and [[Elstree School|Elstree]],<ref>David George Hogarth, ''The life of Charles M. Doughty'', Publisher: Oxford University Press, 1928, 216 pages (page 2)</ref> and at a school for the [[Royal Navy]], [[Portsmouth]]. He was a student at [[King's College School]], [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]], and went up to [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]], migrating to [[Downing College, Cambridge]], from which he took a BA in 1866, then taking an [[Master of Arts (Oxford, Cambridge, and Dublin)|MA]] from Caius in 1869.<ref>{{acad|id=DTY861CM|name=Doughty, Charles Montagu}}</ref><ref>Burke's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage, 107th edition, vol. 2, ed.

==Career==
Doughty is best known for his 1888 travel book ''[[Travels in Arabia Deserta]]'', a work in two volumes that, although it had little immediate influence upon its publication, slowly became a kind of touchstone of ambitious travel writing, one valued as much for its language as for its content. [[T. E. Lawrence]] rediscovered the book and caused it to be republished in the 1920s, contributing an admiring introduction of his own. Since then, the book has gone in and out of print.

The book is a vast recounting of Doughty's treks through the Arabian deserts, and his discoveries there. It is written in an extravagant and mannered style, largely based on the [[King James Bible]] but constantly surprising with verbal turns and odd inventiveness.

Among authors who have praised the book are the British novelist [[Henry Green]], whose essay on Doughty, "Apologia," is reprinted in his collection ''Surviving''. Green's novels arguably show some direct stylistic influence of Doughty's book, as noted by [[John Updike]] in his introduction to the collection of Green's novels ''Loving; Living; Party Going''.<ref>Green, Henry. ''Loving; Living; Party Going''. Penguin Books, 1978. (Introduction by John Updike)</ref>

Doughty's epic poem ''The Dawn in Britain'', originally published 1906 in six volumes, provides a preparatory basis and ideal for [[Laura (Riding) Jackson]] and Schuyler B. Jackson's project of establishing an access to what they argue is an inherent meaning of words in their ''Rational Meaning: a New Foundation for the Definition of Words and Supplementary Essays''.<ref>Jackson, Laura (Riding) and Schuyler B..  Rational Meaning: A New Foundation for the Definition of Words and Supplementary Essays. University Press of Virginia 1997. (Introduction by Charles Bernstein)</ref>

The Jacksons hail Doughty's work as being exemplary of this access to meaning through the linguistic understanding he demonstrates in his diction, in the care he takes with his choice of words, which prefers pre-Shakespearean English for reasons "fundamentally linguistic, rather than literary."<ref>p. 58 Jackson, Laura (Riding) and Schuyler B..  Rational Meaning: A New Foundation for the Definition of Words and Supplementary Essays. University Press of Virginia 1997. (Introduction by Charles Bernstein)</ref> Whole sections of the Jacksons' book examine Doughty's linguistic care and thinking.

He was awarded the 1912 [[Royal Geographical Society]]'s [[Gold Medal (RGS)|Founder's Gold Medal]] for his travels and writings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rgs.org/NR/rdonlyres/C5962519-882A-4C67-803D-0037308C756D/0/GoldMedallists18322011.pdf |title=List of Past Gold Medal Winners |publisher=Royal Geographical Society |accessdate=24 August 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927221002/http://www.rgs.org/NR/rdonlyres/C5962519-882A-4C67-803D-0037308C756D/0/GoldMedallists18322011.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2011 }}</ref>
