'''Catherine Cuthbertson''' (c. 1775 – June 1842) was an English-language novelist published in London in the early 19th century. She may also have written an unpublished 1803 play under the name "Miss Cuthbertson".

==Unknowns==
Cuthbertson's origins are not known, although it appears that she was born before 1780, was the daughter of an army officer, and had at least four siblings. She is thought to have died some time after her final known book appeared in 1830.<ref name="Orlando">Orlando Project [http://orlando.cambridge.org/public/svPeople?person_id=cuthca Retrieved 28 November 2015]</ref> Suppositions that she was a sister of [[Helen Craik]] have not been substantiated.<ref name="Corvey">Corvey "Adopt an Author": "Biography of Catherine Cuthbertson by Beryl Chaudhuri" [http://extra.shu.ac.uk/corvey/corinne/Corinne%20authors/1%20cuthbertson/Cuthbertson%20biography.htm Retrieved 28 November 2015].</ref> Research in 2016 at the [[University of Kent]] revealed that "Kitty" Cuthbertson was well known in her time.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |url=https://blogs.kent.ac.uk/ladys-magazine/2016/04/17/finding-the-mysterious-miss-cuthbertson-and-the-ladys-magazine/ |title=Finding the Mysterious Miss Cuthbertson in the Lady's Magazine {{!}} The Lady's Magazine (1770-1818): Understanding the Emergence of a Genre |website=blogs.kent.ac.uk |access-date=12 November 2016}}</ref> A burial record discovered indicates that she died in Ealing in June 1842, possibly aged 67.

==Works==
Among her works were ''Romance of the Pyrenees'' (1803), ''Forest of Montalbano'' (1810), ''Adelaide; or, The Countercharm'' (1813), ''Rosabella, or A Mother's Marriage'' (1817), ''The Hut and the Castle: a Romance'' (1823), and ''Sir Ethelbert; or, the Dissolution of Monasteries'' (1830).<ref>Joanne Shattock: ''Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature'', Vol. 4; Volumes 1800–1900'' (Cambridge, UK: CUP), 2000.</ref><ref>Open Library [https://openlibrary.org/authors/OL3466032A/Catherine_Cuthbertson Catherine Cuthbertson].</ref> At least one, ''Santo Sebastiano'' (1806), was published twice in penny instalments, as ''The Heiress of Montalvan, or First and Second Love''(1845–46) and as ''Santo Sebastiano, or The Heiress of Montalvan'' (1847–48).<ref>[[Montague Summers]]: ''A Gothic Bibliography'' (New York: Russell & Russell, 1964 [1941]), p. 494.</ref>

Cuthbertson has been described by present-day scholars as a "fairly conventional novelist" using "historically realised settings (often in continental Europe)" with "happy endings". Her upper-class characters appear virtuous, her lower-class ones comic or occasionally horrific.<ref name="Orlando"/> There are many incidents of fainting.<ref name=":0"/><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e71MAgAAQBAJ&q=kitty+cuthbertson+fainting+fits&pg=PA23 |title=Love, Mystery and Misery: Feeling in Gothic Fiction |last=Howells|first=Coral Ann |date=13 January 2014 |publisher=A&C Black |isbn=9781472510242 |language=en}}</ref>

A recent anthologist puts her among "the best of the [[Mary Ann Radcliffe|Radcliffe]] imitators."<ref name="Gothic">Rictor Norton, ed.: ''Gothic Readings.

It took three years and "is the longest novel ever published in an eighteenth-century [[miscellany]], with the single exception of ''[[Pamela; or, Virtue Rewarded|Pamela]]''."<ref>Robert D.
