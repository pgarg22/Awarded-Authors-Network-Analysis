'''Tracey Tawhiao''' (born 1967) is a New Zealand Maori artist. Her ancestry can be traced to Ngai te Rangi, Whakatohea, Tuwharetoa.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.fernergalleries.co.nz/default,430.sm|title=Ferner Galleries {{!}} Tracey Tawhiao|website=www.fernergalleries.co.nz|access-date=6 July 2019}}</ref>  

==Life==

Tracey Tawhiao is a prolific artist with a wide range of creative expression including poetry, painting, performance and film making. She is well known for using newspaper as the basis of her practise, obscuring passages of text with block colours and maori symbols and motifs, whilst highlighting short headlines or individual words. Tawhiao’s artistic practise arose from time spent with her grandparents at their [[Matakana Island]] home. The walls were covered in newspapers and Tawhiao's idea to brighten the place up was to apply symbols and images directly to the walls. This close connection to the text highlighted to her the negativity implicit in the headlines.<ref name=":0" />

==Education==

Tawhiao graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) Classical Studies Major; Otago University, Dunedin and also a Bachelor of Laws (LLB) Otago University and Auckland University.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.houseoftaonga.com/tracey-tawhiao/|title=Tracey Tawhiao « House of Taonga|language=en-US|access-date=6 July 2019}}</ref> 

==Works==

Tawhiao was asked to create work to enhance the exterior of the Hotel Britomart whilst under construction. This was the first to feature in the series 'Works on Paper'. She says of her work "The newspaper is putting a version of the news out to us, and I’m really colonising the page and reappropriating the page and making the new news."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://britomart.org/britomart-people-tracey-tawhiao/|title=Britomart people: Tracey Tawhiao|date=3 October 2018|website=Britomart|language=en-NZ|access-date=6 July 2019}}</ref>

Tawhiao's work is informed by the experience of Māori in a colonised world. She has been heavily influenced by the juxtaposition of living alongside her grandparents and their way of life on Matakana Island to the demands and 'chaos of contemporary living' outside that setting.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Taiawhio Conversations with Contemporary Māori Artists|last=Smith|first=Huhanna|publisher=Te Papa Press|year=2002|isbn=0-909010-86-2|location=New Zealand|pages=166–177}}</ref>
