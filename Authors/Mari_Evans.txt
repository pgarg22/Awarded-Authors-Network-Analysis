==Early life and education==
Evans was born in [[Toledo, Ohio]], on July 16, 1919, to Mary Jane Jacobs and William Reed Evans.<ref name=Birthdate>Some sources incorrectly report that the year of Evans's birth was 1923.

Evans attended local public schools before enrolling at the [[University of Toledo]] in 1939. She majored in fashion design, but left in 1941 without earning a college degree.<ref name=":0" /><ref name="BlackPast"/>

== Career ==
After leaving college, Evans decided to pursue a career as a musician.<ref name=":0" /> This decision prompted her to move to the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], where she began to collaborate with various jazz musicians, including [[Wes Montgomery]], a native of [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]]. In 1947, Evans left the East Coast and moved to Indianapolis. After she settled in the city, Evans worked for the Indiana Housing Authority before joining the [[United States federal civil service|U.S. Civil Service]].<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{cite book |editor=Gugin, Linda C. |editor2=James E.

Evans gained notoriety as a poet during the 1960s and 1970s and became associated with the [[Black Arts Movement]],<ref name=Story>{{cite web| title =Mari Evans | work =Writing Her Story | publisher =Indiana Commission for Women | url =https://www.in.gov/icw/files/20170331%20Evans,%20Mari.pdf | accessdate =April 17, 2019}}</ref> an effort to explore African American culture and history through the arts and literature.<ref>{{cite web| title =A Brief Guide to the Black Arts Movement | publisher =Academy of American Poets  | url =https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/text/brief-guide-black-arts-movement| accessdate =April 19, 2019}}</ref> In addition to Evans, other prominent members of the movement were [[Amiri Baraka]], [[Gwendolyn Brooks]], [[Nikki Giovanni]], [[Etheridge Knight]], [[Haki R.

I was aware that color was an issue over which the society and I would war."<ref name=Hoppe6>Hoppe, "The Radical Clarity of Mari Evans," p. 6.</ref>

Evans began a series of teaching appointments in American universities in 1969.<ref name=":0" /> During 1969–70 she served as writer-in-residence at [[Indiana University – Purdue University at Indianapolis]], where she taught courses in African American literature. Evans accepted a position the following year as an assistant professor and writer-in-residence at [[Indiana University]] in [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]], where she taught until 1978.<ref name="Oxford University Press" /> From 1968 to 1973, Evans produced, wrote, and directed  ''The Black Experience'', a weekly television program for [[WTTV]] in Indianapolis.<ref name="AAR">{{cite web| title =Mari Evans, a writer and a teacher | publisher =African American Registry | url =http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/mari-evans-writer-and-teacher | accessdate =April 19, 2019}}See also:{{cite web| title =Mari Evans | publisher =Academy of American Poets  | url =https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/mari-evans | accessdate =April 19, 2019}}</ref><ref name=NBAW>{{cite book |author=Smith, Jessie Carney |author2=Shirelle Phelps |chapter=Mari Evans |title =Notable Black American Women | publisher =Gale Research | volume =1 | year =1992 | location =Detroit, Michigan | pages =326–27 | isbn =9780787664947}}</ref> Later, she explained that the program was her attempt to represent African Americans to themselves.<ref name="worldcat.org" />

In 1975 Evans received an honorary doctorate of humane letters degree from [[Marian University (Indiana)|Marian College]].<ref name=Samuels173>{{cite book |author=Wilfred D.

==Writing==
Although her most renowned collection of poetry, ''I Am a Black Woman'' (1970), and many of her early poems preceded the [[Black Arts Movement]], these works coincided with the Black Arts poets' messages of black cultural, psychological, and economic liberation. Themes of love, loss, loneliness, struggle, pride, and resistance are common in Evans's poetry.<ref name="Oxford University Press"/><ref name="worldcat.org"/><ref name=NBAW/> She also used "imagery, metaphor, and rhetoric" to describe the African American experience, the focus of her literary work,<ref name=Story/> and explained that "when I write, I write according to the title of poetry Margaret Walker's classic: 'for my people'."<ref name=Hoppe8>Hoppe, "The Radical Clarity of Mari Evans," p. 8.</ref>

Evans's writing focused primarily of the issues of race and identity. Her poems frequently featured African American women.<ref name=Beaulieu>{{cite book |editor=Elizabeth Ann Beaulieu | title =Writing African American Women: An Encyclopedia of Literature By and About Women of Color | publisher =Greenwood Press | volume =I | year =2009 | location =Westport, Connecticut | pages =[https://archive.org/details/writingafricanam0000unse/page/307 307–09] | url =https://archive.org/details/writingafricanam0000unse/page/307 | isbn =978-0313331978 }}</ref> She also became "known for her intensity and no-nonsense candor."<ref name=Higgins/> Although her first poetry collection, ''Where is All the Music?'', did not attract critical acclaim, her second poetry collection, ''I Am a Black Woman'' (1970), brought her international attention and notoriety. This second collection called for social change and included her best-known individual poem, "I Am a Black Woman."<ref name=Beaulieu/><ref name=Chen>{{cite news| author=Chen, Wei-Huan | title =Indiana poet Mari Evans receives lifetime achievement award | newspaper =The Indianapolis Star | location =Indianapolis, Indiana | publisher =IndyStar.com | date =October 8, 2015| url=http://www.indystar.com/story/entertainment/2015/10/08/indiana-poet-mari-evans-receives-lifetime-achievement-award/73545482/ | accessdate =April 19, 2019}}</ref> Evans's other memorable poems include: "Celebration," "If There be Sorrow," "Speak the Truth to the People," "When in Rome," and "The Rebel," among others.<ref name=Story/> Her later works included poetry collections, ''Nightstar 1973–1978''  (1981), considered one of her best poetry collections, and ''A Dark and Splendid Mass'' (1992).<ref name=Beaulieu/><ref name=Hoppe12>Hoppe, "The Radical Clarity of Mari Evans," p. 12.</ref>

In her later work, Evans began to use experimental techniques and incorporate African American idioms in ways that encouraged readers to identify with and respect the speaker.<ref name="Oxford University Press"/> Her poems were also characterized as "realistic," "hopeful," "sometimes ironic," and enthusiastic.<ref name=Higgins/> In her poem, "Who Can Be Born Black," she concludes with the lines: "Who/ can be born/ black/ and not exhult!"<ref name=Higgins/> In addition, Evans spoke of the need to make Blackness both beautiful and powerful.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} In her poem "I am a Black Woman", the final stanza reads: "I am a black woman/ tall as a cypress/ strong/ beyond all definition still/ defying place/ and time/ and circumstance/ assailed/ impervious/ indestructible/ Look on me and be/renewed."<ref>{{cite web| author=Evans, Mari| title =I am a Black Woman – Poem by Mari Evans | publisher =PoemHunter.com | url =https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/i-am-a-black-woman | accessdate =April 28, 2019}}</ref> She is also well known for the line: "I have never been contained except I made the prison."{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

Although she is primarily known for her poetry, Evans also wrote short fiction, children's books, dramas, nonfiction articles, and essays.<ref name=Adams-Late/> She also edited the "ground-breaking anthology," ''Black Women Writers (1950–1980): A Critical Evaluation'' (1984),<ref name=Hoppe12/> and wrote ''Clarity As Concept: A Poet's Perspective'' (2006), a collection of essays.<ref name=Hoppe6/> Evans tackled social issues in her writing, even in her children's books. ''Dear Corinne, Tell Somebody! Love, Annie'' (1999), for example, is about child abuse and ''"I'm Late"'' (2006) deals with teen pregnancy.<ref name=NBAW/><ref name=Adams-Funeral/>

In 1975 Evans attended the [[MacDowell Colony|MacDowell Writers Colony]] and in 1984 she attended the [[Yaddo]] writers retreat.<ref name=":0" />

Evans was "often considered a key figure of the Black Arts Movement" and among the most influential of the twentieth century's black poets.<ref name=Chen/> Although she was well known in East Coast "literary circles," Evans and her poetry were not as well known in Indianapolis, where she lived for many years.<ref name=Adams-Late/> A literary critic noted that Evans used "black idioms to communicate the authentic voice of the black community is a unique characteristic of her poetry."<ref name=Beaulieu/> ''I Am a Black Woman'' (1970), her best-known poetry collection, won the Black Academy of Art and Letters First Poetry Award in 1975, and includes her best-known poem, "I Am a Black Woman."<ref name=NBAW/> ''Black Women Writers (1950–1980): A Critical Evaluation'', a collection of more than forty essays related to the literary contributions of fifteen women writers, including Evans, is considered  "an important addition" to the limited scholarly work on the subject of black women authors.<ref name=Beaulieu/>
