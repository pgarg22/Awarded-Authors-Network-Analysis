'''Louis Osborne Coxe''' (April 15, 1918&nbsp;– May 25, 1993) was an American poet, playwright, essayist, and professor who was recognized by the [[Academy of American Poets]] for his "long, powerful, quiet accomplishment, largely unrecognized, in lyric poetry." He was probably best known for [[Billy Budd (play)|his dramatic adaptation]] of [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Billy Budd]]'', which opened on Broadway in 1951.

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Manchester, New Hampshire]] in 1918 but raised in [[Salem, Massachusetts]] (where his family had lived since 1640), Coxe was educated at [[St. Paul's School (Concord, New Hampshire)|St. Paul's School]]. He graduated from [[Princeton University]] in 1940, writing his senior thesis on [[Edwin Arlington Robinson]].

==Career==
During [[World War II]], Coxe served in the [[United States Navy]], commanding the U.S.S. PC-549 in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|South Pacific Theater]] during the Northern [[Solomon Islands campaign]] and the [[invasion of Guam]] and [[invasion of Saipan]]-Tinian (and later the U.S.S. PC-1195), an experience that would shape much of his poetry. After leaving active service in 1946, he married Edith Winsor, granddaughter of Boston financier [[Robert Winsor]], and began teaching at Princeton. He was Briggs-Copeland Fellow at [[Harvard University]] from 1948 to 1949, and from 1949 to 1955, he taught at the [[University of Minnesota]]. Coxe then moved to [[Bowdoin College]] in [[Brunswick, Maine]] in 1956, where he remained (except for brief appointments at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], Ireland, and the [[University of Aix-Marseilles]], France) as head of the English department until his death in 1993 after 11 years suffering from [[Alzheimer's disease]].

==Recognition==
Coxe received his largest critical recognition for his dramatic adaptation, with [[Robert Chapman (playwright)|Robert Chapman]], of [[Herman Melville]]'s morality tale [[Billy Budd]], which opened to critical acclaim on Broadway in 1951, winning both the [[Donaldson Awards]] and the [[Outer Critics Circle Award]] for best play. The [[New York Times]]' [[Brooks Atkinson]] called it "extraordinarily well done," and said that "the tragic portions are written with taste, firmness and intelligence." Coxe was also credited with co-writing the screenplay for [[Peter Ustinov]]'s film version of the play. He wrote several other plays, most for local productions in Maine, one of which, "Decoration Day" (about Civil War general [[Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain]]), was published as a book along with his long narrative poem "Nikal Seyn." He was also praised for his criticism, writing books on both [[Chaucer]] and [[Edwin Arlington Robinson]].

But Coxe's main focus was his poetry, which U.S. Poet Laureate [[Howard Nemerov]] called "terse, cryptic, almost savage in their beauty." Much of his work focused on his experience during World War II and the natural environment of his native New England. Several of his poems, reviews and essays appeared first in [[The New Yorker]], [[The New Republic]], [[Paris Review]], and [[Atlantic Monthly]]. In 1972 the [[Maine Arts Commission|Maine State Commission on the Arts and Humanities]] presented him with a Maine State Award for his significant contributions to the cultural life of Maine. He was named the 36th fellow of the [[Academy of American Poets]] in 1977<ref name="NYT-19771201 Notes on People">{{Cite web |date=December 1, 1977 |title=Notes on People |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/01/archives/notes-on-people.html |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210527034146/https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/01/archives/notes-on-people.html |archive-date=May 26, 2021 |access-date=May 27, 2021 |website=The New York Times |page=63 |language=en-US}}</ref> and was awarded a creative writing grant from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] that same year.
