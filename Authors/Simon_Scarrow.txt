He is best known for his ''[[Eagles of the Empire]]'' series of [[Roman military]] fiction set in the territories of the Roman Empire, covering the [[Roman conquest of Britain|second invasion of Britain]] and the subsequent prolonged campaign undertaken by the rump of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]]. As of December 2019, there are 18 books in the series; the latest, "Traitors of Rome", was published in 2019.<ref name="Simon Scarrow Official Website">{{cite web |url=https://www.simonscarrow.co.uk/landing-page/simon-scarrow/simon-scarrow-books/simon-scarrow-eagles-of-the-empire/ |title=Simon Scarrow Official Website |website=Simon Scarrow Official Website |publisher=Simon Scarrow |access-date=8 December 2019}}</ref>

He has also written another series, ''[[The Revolution Quartet|Revolution]]'', focusing on [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]] and [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], whose first title, ''[[Young Bloods (novel)|Young Bloods]]'', was published in 2006.

==Books==
The last fifteen of Scarrow's novels have been Sunday Times bestsellers. His works have been translated into over twenty languages and have sold several million copies. He has been awarded two prizes for his fiction and counts the King of Jordan as one of his fans. At present his Roman series has been optioned by a Hollywood studio to be produced as a TV series. Asked by the ''Edinburgh Book Review'' about the inspiration behind his interest in the Roman era, Scarrow said, "Firstly, great [[Latin]] teachers â€“ Gordon Rodway and then Reg Nash, who inspired a love of the language and more enduringly a fascination with Roman history and culture. Secondly, when I was growing up in the seventies [[Peplum (film genre)|swords and sandals]] epics seemed to be on the TV regularly. Not to mention the brilliant ''[[I, Claudius (TV series)|I, Claudius]]''".<ref name="Edinburgh Book Review 26 March 2015">{{cite news |author= Wander |title= Interview with Simon Scarrow |url= http://www.edinburghbookreview.co.uk/news/interview-with-simon-scarrow | date= 26 March 2015|work= Edinburgh Book Review |location= Edinburgh| access-date=28 June 2016 }}</ref> Scarrow cites the inspiration for his 'earthy' characters as being from his time in the [[Officer Training Corps]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scarrow.co.uk/page15.html|title=The Gladiator|publisher=Scarrow.co.uk|access-date=6 October 2014}}</ref>

===''Eagles of the Empire'' series===
The ''[[Eagles of the Empire]]'' series centres upon two main protagonists, [[Eagles of the Empire#Main characters|Quintus Licinius Cato]] and [[Eagle Series#Main characters|Lucius Cornelius Macro]], who are both [[legionary|Roman soldiers]]. Macro, a veteran with nearly 15 years' service (at the start of the first novel) in the Roman Army, has recently been appointed to the Centurionate. Cato is in his teen years, grew up in the Imperial Palace as a slave, and at the start of the series joins the Eagles as Macro's Optio. The first book starts in 42 [[Anno Domini|AD]]. The books cover the experiences of the two soldiers, initially as experienced [[centurion]] and new [[optio]], in battles in Germania and the invasion of Britain by [[Claudius]] as part of the [[Legio II Augusta]]. The 6th book ''[[The Eagle's Prophecy]]'' has them serving as part of the Imperial Navy east of Italy. The 7th and 8th put them in Rome's eastern provinces as agents of the Emperor's secretary [[Tiberius Claudius Narcissus]]. The 9th sees them shipwrecked on the island of [[Crete]], fighting against a full-scale uprising. The 11th is set in Rome with the leads hoping to save the emperor from the shady Liberators. ''The Blood Crows'' is set once again in Britannia. The two protagonists are faced with defeating tribal rebels.

The two characters Cato and Macro were additionally used in one book of the ''[[TimeRiders]]'' series: ''Gates of Rome''. They served as supporting characters when the three protagonists travel back to ancient Rome. Scarrow allowed his brother Alex to make use of the characters in his novel.

In 2007 the publisher announced the intention to cease using the word "Eagle" in the title of books in this series, starting with ''Centurion''. The change was apparently because the publisher wanted to attract more new readers to the series.
