<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Garciadelahuerta.jpeg|thumb|right|Garcia de la Huerta]] -->'''Vicente Antonio García de la Huerta''' (9 March 1734, in [[Zafra]]{{snd}}12 March 1787, in [[Madrid]]) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[dramatist]], educated at [[Salamanca]]. At Madrid he soon attracted attention by his literary arrogance and handsome person, and at an early age became chief of the National Library, a post from which he was dismissed owing to the intrigues of his numerous enemies. The publication of his unsatisfactory collection of Spanish plays entitled ''Theatro Hespañol'' (1785-1786) exposed him to severe censures, which appear to have affected his reason.<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=García de la Huerta, Vicente Antonio|volume=11|page=457}}</ref>

He died at Madrid, without carrying into effect his avowed intention of reviving the national drama. His ''Agamemnon vengado'' derives from [[Sophocles]], his faire is translated from [[Voltaire]], and even his once famous ''Raquel'', though Spanish in subject, is classic in form.<ref name="EB1911"/>
