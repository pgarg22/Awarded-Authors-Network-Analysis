Contemporary Black Biography]. 2009. Encyclopedia.com. 11 September 2013.</ref> is a [[Jamaica]]n poet, a leading [[West Indian literature|West Indian writer]] of the generation born after [[World War II]], currently dividing her time between [[Jamaica]] and [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], where she is Professor Emerita, English Language and Literature/Afroamerican and African Studies at the [[University of Michigan]].<ref>[https://ii.umich.edu/ii/people/all/g/goodison.html "Lorna Goodison"], LSA International Institute, University of Michigan.</ref> She was appointed [[Poet Laureate]] of Jamaica in 2017, succeeding [[Mervyn Morris]].<ref>Richard Johnson, [http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/entertainment/Goodison-is-poet-laureate_93059 "Goodison is poet laureate"], ''[[Jamaica Observer]]'', 20 March 2017.</ref> In 2019 she was awarded the [[Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry]].<ref name=RoyalHousehold>[https://www.royal.uk/queen%E2%80%99s-gold-medal-poetry-2019-awarded-lorna-goodison "Queen’s Gold Medal for Poetry 2019 awarded to Lorna Goodison"]. The Royal Household, 18 December 2019.</ref>

Poet and literary scholar [[Edward Baugh]] says "one of Goodison’s achievements is that her poetry inscribes the Jamaican sensibility and culture on the text of the world".<ref>Edward Baugh, [http://caribbeanreviewofbooks.com/crb-archive/7-february-2006/making-life/ "Making Life"], ''[[Caribbean Review of Books]]'', February 2006.</ref> Apart from issues of home and exile, her work also addresses the power of art to explore and reconcile opposites and contradictions in the [[Caribbean]] historical experience. [[Kei Miller]] notes, "Primarily a poet, Goodison hasn’t been afraid of crossing the fence into other genres: she has written short stories and a much-celebrated memoir. ...I suspect she still isn't as celebrated as she really ought to be because there simply doesn’t exist the perfect critical language to talk about what she is doing, the risks she is taking, and why exactly they succeed."<ref>Kei Miller: [http://carcanetblog.blogspot.co.uk/2013/11/kei-miller-appreciation-of-lorna.html "An Appreciation of Lorna Goodison"], Carcanet Press, 15 November 2013.</ref>

Also a painter, Goodison has illustrated her own book covers, as well as exhibiting her artwork in the Caribbean, the US and Europe.<ref name=encyclo>[https://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/culture-magazines/goodison-lorna-1947 "Goodison, Lorna 1947–"], Encyclopedia.com.</ref>

==Biography==
===Early years===
Lorna Gaye Goodison was born in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]], Jamaica,<ref name=encyclopedia /> one of nine siblings (who include the award-winning journalist [[Barbara Gloudon]]).<ref name=Gleaner>[http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/lead-stories/20170519/lorna-goodison-poet-laureate-lover-country-voice-its-people "Lorna Goodison - Poet Laureate, A Lover Of Country, A Voice To Its People"], ''Jamaica Gleaner'', 19 May 2017.</ref> She was educated at [[St. Hugh's High School]], a leading Anglican high school in Jamaica, and studied at the [[Jamaica School of Art]], before going on to the [[Art Students League of New York]].<ref name=PF>[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poets/detail/lorna-goodison "Lorna Goodison"], Poetry Foundation.</ref><ref name=Gleaner /> As well as painting, she had also been writing poetry since her teenage years; some early poems appeared anonymously in the ''[[Gleaner Company|Jamaica Gleaner]]''. Goodison has described poetry as "a dominating, intrusive tyrant. It's something I have to do – a wicked force".<ref>Interview with ''The Guardian'', quoted in the introduction to her 1986 collection of poetry, ''I Am Becoming My Mother''.</ref> She has also acknowledged: "A lot of what I learned about creative writing is owed to [[Derek Walcott]], so I learned from the best."<ref name=Gleaner />

In her twenties, back in Jamaica, she taught art and worked in advertising and public relations before deciding to pursue a career as a professional writer. She began to publish under her own name in the ''[[Jamaica Journal]]'', and to give readings at which she built up an appreciative audience.

In the early 1990s, Goodison began teaching part of the year at various North American universities, including the [[University of Toronto]] and the [[University of Michigan]].

===Writing===
Goodison's first book to be published was the 1980 volume of poems ''Tamarind Season'', and speaking of how it came about she has said: "I was writing these poems, and some people began to take notice. Like [[Neville Dawes]], who was the head of the Institute of Jamaica. At the time, I was working at an advertising agency where everybody was moonlighting as an artist. After I finished writing copy, I would spend time in my office writing poems."<ref name="Globe and Mail">{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books/article-queens-gold-medal-winning-poet-lorna-goodison-on-her-career-her/|title='I did not see these stories being written': Lorna Goodison, winner of the Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry, looks back on a 40-year career as a poet|first=Donna|last=Bailey Nurse|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=22 May 2020}}</ref> ''Tamarind Season'' was followed in 1986 by ''I Am Becoming My Mother'', for which Goodison received the [[Commonwealth Writers Prize]] for the Americas.<ref name="Globe and Mail" /> Her subsequent poetry collections include ''Heartease'' (published in 1988, and described by [[Velma Pollard]] as "the uncovering for us of a spirit that has looked for, and found, a place"),<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/23019620|title=Review|journal=Journal of West Indian Literature|author=Velma Pollard|volume=3|number= 2|date=September 1989|pages= 90–-97}}</ref> ''Poems'' (1989), ''Selected Poems'' (1992), ''To Us, All Flowers Are Roses'' (1995), ''Turn Thanks'' (1999), ''Guinea Woman'' (2000), ''Travelling Mercies'' (2001), ''Controlling the Silver'' (2005), ''Goldengrove'' (2006), ''Oracabessa'' (2013) and ''Supplying Salt and Light'' (2013). ''Oracabessa'' won the Poetry category of the 2014 [[OCM Bocas Prize for Caribbean Literature]].<ref>[http://www.bocaslitfest.com/2014/three-writers-join-the-shortlist-for-the-2014-ocm-bocas-prize/ "Three Writers Join The Shortlist For The 2014 OCM Bocas Prize"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160730131520/http://www.bocaslitfest.com/2014/three-writers-join-the-shortlist-for-the-2014-ocm-bocas-prize/ |date=30 July 2016 }}, Bocas News, [[NGC Bocas Lit Fest]], 30 March 2014.</ref>

Goodison's most recent collection of poems, ''Mother Muse'', was published in June 2021, when [[Ben Wilkinson (poet)|Ben Wilkinson]] wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'': "Her writing is often a celebration of the spirit and tenacity of women; in various ways, Mother Muse ... extends this feature of her work."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jun/04/the-best-recent-poetry-review-roundup|title=The best recent poetry – review roundup|first=Ben|last=Wilkinson|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 June 2021}}</ref> ''Mother Muse'' "orbits around two important 'mother' figures in Jamaican music: [[Mary Ignatius Davies|Sister Mary Ignatius]], the nun who ran Kingston's [[Alpha Boys School]], celebrated for nurturing musical talent; and [[Anita Mahfood|Anita 'Margarita' Mahfood]], a celebrated dancer and lover of ill-fated musician [[Don Drummond]] — who was an Alpha Boys alumnus. Other poems contemplate, celebrate, and elegise woman ranging from the famous to the tragic to the unknown."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://trinidadexpress.com/features/local/the-inspiring-mother-muse/article_f7cba7b8-dc5d-11eb-841b-e31336cc4ef0.html|title=The inspiring Mother Muse|newspaper=[[Trinidad Express]]|date=3 July 2021}}</ref>

Goodison has also published three collections of short stories, ''Baby Mother and the King of Swords'' (1990), ''Fool-Fool Rose Is Leaving Labour-in-Vain Savannah'' (2005), and ''By Love Possessed'' (2012).<ref>Rebecca Tuhus-Dubrow, [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/16/books/review/by-love-possessed-by-lorna-goodison-and-more.html "Fiction Chronicle"] (review of ''By Love Possessed''), ''[[The New York Times]]'', 14 December 2012.</ref>

Her memoir, ''From Harvey River'', was published in 2008, and was featured on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Book of the Week]]'' in May 2009, read by [[Doña Croll]].<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00k3fg7 "From Harvey River"], ''Book of the Week'', BBC Radio 4, 5 May 2009.</ref> The review by [[Lisa Fugard]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' concluded: "Goodison's praise songs can be found in her many volumes of poetry and now in this loving memoir. It's a legacy that can be traced back to her infancy, when Goodison's mother dipped her finger in sugar and rubbed it under her daughter's tongue, ensuring her the gift of sweet speech."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/30/books/review/Fugard-t.html|title=Mama Goodie|author=Lisa Fugard|newspaper=The New York Times|date=30 March 2008}}</ref>

==Recognition==
On 6 August 2013, Goodison was awarded the Jamaican national honour of the [[Order of Distinction]] in the rank of Commander (CD), "for outstanding achievements in Literature and Poetry".<ref>[http://jis.gov.jm/information/awards/national-honours-awards/ National Honours and Awards], Office of the Prime Minister, 2013.</ref><ref>[http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20130807/ent/ent1.html "The Arts Play Big Part In This Year's National Honour"], ''The Gleaner'', 7 August 2013.</ref>
