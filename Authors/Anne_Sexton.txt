'''Anne Sexton'''  (born '''Anne Gray Harvey'''; November 9, 1928 – October 4, 1974) was an American poet known for her highly personal, [[confessional poetry|confessional verse]]. She won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for poetry in 1967 for her book ''[[Live or Die (book)|Live or Die]]''. Her poetry details her long battle with [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], suicidal tendencies, and intimate details from her private life, including relationships with her husband and children, whom it was later alleged she physically and sexually assaulted.

==Early life and family==
Anne Sexton was born Anne Gray Harvey in [[Newton, Massachusetts]] to Mary Gray (Staples) Harvey (1901–1959) and Ralph Churchill Harvey (1900–1959). She had two older sisters, Jane Elizabeth (Harvey) Jealous (1923–1983) and Blanche Dingley (Harvey) Taylor (1925–2011). She spent most of her childhood in Boston. In 1945 she enrolled at Rogers Hall boarding school, in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], later spending a year at [[Garland Junior College|Garland School]].<ref>Middlebrook, p. 21.</ref> For a time she [[model (person)|modeled]] for Boston's Hart Agency. On August 16, 1948, she married Alfred Muller Sexton II and they remained together until 1973.<ref>{{cite web |last=Nelson |first=Cary |url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/s_z/sexton/chrono.htm |title=Anne Sexton Chronology |work=Modern American Poetry website |publisher=[[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] |date=2008-08-27 |access-date=2009-02-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219234755/http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/s_z/sexton/chrono.htm |archive-date= 19 February 2009  |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=morris >{{cite web |last=Morris |first=Tim |title=A Brief Biography of the Life of Anne Sexton |url=http://www.uta.edu/english/tim/poetry/as/bio1.html |date=1999-04-23 |publisher=[[University of Texas at Arlington]] |access-date=2009-02-20}}</ref> Sexton had her first child, [[Linda Gray Sexton]], in 1953. Her second child, Joyce Ladd Sexton, was born two years later.

==Poetry==
Sexton suffered from severe [[bipolar disorder]] for much of her life, her first manic episode taking place in 1954. After a second episode in 1955 she met [[Martin Theodore Orne|Dr. Martin Orne]], who became her long-term therapist at the Glenside Hospital. It was Orne who encouraged her to write poetry.<ref name="Middlebrook">Middlebrook</ref>

The first poetry workshop she attended was led by [[John Holmes (poet)|John Holmes]]. Sexton felt great trepidation about registering for the class, asking a friend to make the phone call and accompany her to the first session. She found early acclaim with her poems; a number were accepted by ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' and the ''[[Saturday Review (US magazine)|Saturday Review]]''. Sexton later studied with [[Robert Lowell]] at [[Boston University]] alongside poets [[Sylvia Plath]] and [[George Starbuck]].<ref name=morris /><ref name=carroll>{{cite journal|last=Carroll |first=James |author-link=James Carroll (novelist) |url=http://www.pshares.org/issues/article.cfm?prmarticleid=3360 |title=Review: 'Anne Sexton: A Biography' |journal=Ploughshares |date=Fall 1992 |issue=58 |volume=18 |access-date=2009-01-18 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104042713/http://www.pshares.org/issues/article.cfm?prmArticleid=3360 |archive-date=November 4, 2007 }}</ref> Sexton later paid homage to her friendship with Plath in the 1963 poem "[[Sylvia's Death]]". Her first volume of poetry, ''To Bedlam and Part Way Back'', was published in 1960, and included the poem "[[Her Kind (poem)|Her Kind]]", which uses the persecution of witches as an analogy for the oppression of women in a patriarchal society.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Seagull Book Of Poems|publisher=Norton|year=2018|isbn=978-0-393-63162-3|editor-last=Kelly|editor-first=Joseph|edition=4th|location=New York|pages=282, 441}}</ref>

Sexton's poetic career was encouraged by her mentor [[W.D. Snodgrass]], whom she met at the Antioch Writer's Conference in 1957. His poem "Heart's Needle" proved inspirational for her in its theme of separation from his three-year-old daughter.<ref>Snodgrass, W.D., [http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15302 "Heart's Needle"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060919122651/http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15302 |date=2006-09-19 }}, American Academy of Poets</ref> Sexton first read the poem at a time when her own young daughter was living with her mother-in-law. She, in turn, wrote "The Double Image", a poem which explores the multi-generational relationship between mother and daughter. Sexton began writing letters to Snodgrass and they became friends.

While working with John Holmes, Sexton encountered [[Maxine Kumin]]. They became good friends and remained so for the rest of Sexton's life. Kumin and Sexton rigorously critiqued each other's work and wrote four [[children's book]]s together. In the late 1960s, the manic elements of Sexton's illness began to affect her career, though she still wrote and published work and gave readings of her poetry. She collaborated with musicians, forming a jazz-rock group called Her Kind that added music to her poetry. Her play ''Mercy Street'', starring [[Marian Seldes]], was produced in 1969, after several years of revisions.<ref>(Musician [[Peter Gabriel]] wrote a song inspired by Sexton's work, also titled "[[Mercy Street]]".)</ref> Sexton also collaborated with the artist [[Barbara Swan]], who illustrated several of her books.<ref name=sexton>{{cite book|last1=Sexton|first1=Anne|last2=Sexton|first2=Linda Gray|title=Anne Sexton: A Self-Portrait in Letters|date=2004|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=9780618492428|pages=374, 436|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o_BpgsXOZqgC&pg=PA374}}</ref>

Within 12 years of writing her first sonnet, she was among the most honored poets in the U.S.: a [[Pulitzer Prize]] winner, a fellow of the [[Royal Society of Literature]] and the first female member of the [[Harvard]] chapter of [[Phi Beta Kappa]].<ref name=pollitt-nyt >{{cite news |last=Pollitt |first=Katha |author-link=Katha Pollitt |title=The Death Is Not the Life |date=1991-08-18 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/18/books/the-death-is-not-the-life.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=2009-01-09 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Wagner-Martin |first=Linda |title=Anne Sexton's Life |url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/s_z/sexton/sexton_life.htm |date=2008-08-27 |work=Modern American Poetry website |publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign |access-date=2009-02-02 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090219234026/http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/s_z/sexton/sexton_life.htm| archive-date= 19 February 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>

==Death==
[[File:AnneSextonGrave.jpg|thumb|right|Grave of Anne Sexton, located at [[Forest Hills Cemetery]] in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts]]
On October 4, 1974, Sexton had lunch with Kumin to revise galleys for Sexton's manuscript of ''The Awful Rowing Toward God'', scheduled for publication in March 1975 (Middlebrook 396). On returning home she put on her mother's old fur coat, removed all her rings, poured herself a glass of vodka, locked herself in her garage, and started the engine of her car, ending her life by [[carbon monoxide poisoning]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Suicide of Anne Sexton |last=Hendin |first=Herbert |journal=Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=257–62 |date=Fall 1993 |pmid=8249036}}</ref>

In an interview over a year before her death, she explained she had written the first drafts of ''The Awful Rowing Toward God'' in 20 days with "two days out for despair and three days out in a [[mental hospital]]." She went on to say that she would not allow the poems to be published before her death. She is buried at [[Forest Hills Cemetery|Forest Hills Cemetery & Crematory]] in [[Jamaica Plain, Boston, Massachusetts]].

==Content and themes of work==
Sexton is seen as the modern model of the [[Confessionalism (poetry)|confessional poet]] due to the intimate and emotional content of her poetry. Sexton often wrote and disclosed her struggles with mental illness through her work. Anne Sexton has also included important yet overlooked topics that touched on the overall experience for a woman. Maxine Kumin described Sexton's work: "She wrote openly about menstruation, abortion, masturbation, incest, adultery, and drug addiction at a time when the proprieties embraced none of these as proper topics for poetry."<ref>''Anne Sexton'' (1988) Steven E. Colburn, University of Michigan Press, 1988 p438 {{ISBN|9780472063796}}</ref> Sexton's work towards the end of the sixties has been criticized as "preening, lazy and flip" by otherwise respectful critics.<ref name="pollitt-nyt" /> Some critics regard her dependence on alcohol as compromising her last work. However, other critics see Sexton as a poet whose writing matured over time. "Starting as a relatively conventional writer, she learned to roughen up her line&nbsp;... to use as an instrument against the 'politesse' of language, politics, religion [and] sex."<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Rothenberg |editor1-first=Jerome |editor2-last=Joris |editor2-first=Pierre |editor1-link=Jerome Rothenberg |title=Poems for the Millennium |volume=2 |year=1995 |publisher=University of California Press |page=330 |isbn=978-0-520-07225-1 |oclc=29702496 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0e4lAAAACAAJ }}</ref> Sexton was heavily criticized for her poetic content and themes, but these topics contributed to the popularity of her work.

Her eighth collection of poetry is entitled ''The Awful Rowing Toward God''. The title came from her meeting with a Roman Catholic priest who, unwilling to administer [[last rites]], told her "God is in your typewriter." This gave the poet the desire and willpower to continue living and writing. ''The Awful Rowing Toward God'' and ''[[The Death Notebooks]]'' are among her final works, and both center on the theme of dying.<ref>{{cite web |title=Anne Sexton |work=Poets of Cambridge, U.S.A. |publisher=Harvard Square Library |url=http://harvardsquarelibrary.org/poets/sexton.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028145353/http://harvardsquarelibrary.org/poets/sexton.php |archive-date=2007-10-28 }}</ref>

Her work started out as being about herself, however as her career progressed she made periodic attempts to reach outside the realm of her own life for poetic themes.<ref name=ostriker >{{cite book |last=Ostriker |first=Alicia |title=Writing like a woman |publisher=University of Michigan Press |year=1983 |isbn=978-0-472-06347-5 |quote=Self was the center, self was the perimeter, of her vision |url=https://archive.org/details/writinglikewoman00ostr }}</ref>  ''Transformations'' (1971), which is a re-visionary re-telling of ''[[Grimm's Fairy Tales]]'', is one such book.<ref>Del George, Dana, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dk9UPLDofsoC&pg=PA37&dq=Anne+Sexton+Godfather+death&cd=1#v=onepage&q=Anne%20Sexton%20Godfather%20death&f=false ''The Supernatural in Short Fiction of the Americas: The Other World in the New World''], Greenwood Publishing Group, 2001, p. 37. {{ISBN|0-313-31939-1}}

Much has been made of the tangled threads of her writing, her life and her depression, much in the same way as with [[Sylvia Plath]]'s suicide in 1963. [[Robert Lowell]], [[Adrienne Rich]] and [[Denise Levertov]] commented in separate obituaries on the role of creativity in Sexton's death. Levertov says, "We who are alive must make clear, as she could not, the distinction between creativity and self-destruction."<ref name=carroll />

==Subsequent controversy==
Following one of many suicide attempts and manic or depressive episodes, Sexton worked with therapist Martin Orne.<ref name="pollitt-nyt" /> He diagnosed her with what is now described as [[bipolar disorder]], but his competence to do so is called into question by his early use of allegedly unsound psychotherapeutic techniques.<ref>Jamison, K.R., [http://www.sciamdigital.com/index.cfm?fa=Products.ViewIssuePreview&ISSUEID_CHAR=850C0446-E166-43CE-B484-54DAB90A59E&ARTICLEID_CHAR=736A3D3A-5223-4B74-8FA9-B1DBF4F6D56 "Manic-depressive illness and creativity"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130915214353/http://www.sciamdigital.com/index.cfm?fa=Products.ViewIssuePreview&ISSUEID_CHAR=850C0446-E166-43CE-B484-54DAB90A59E&ARTICLEID_CHAR=736A3D3A-5223-4B74-8FA9-B1DBF4F6D56 |date=2013-09-15 }}. ''Scientific American'', February 1995, pp. 68–73</ref> During sessions with Anne Sexton he used [[hypnosis]] and [[sodium thiopental|sodium pentothal]] to recover supposedly [[repressed memory|repressed memories]]. During this process, he allegedly used suggestion to uncover memories of having been abused by her father.<ref Name=Daddy>[https://books.google.com/books?id=SFdbcS_A1XEC&pg=PA26&dq=sexton+repressed+memories+orne&hl=en&sa=X&ei=95m4UryFFMuU7Qaco4BI&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=sexton%20repressed%20memories%20orne&f=false ''Imagining Incest: Sexton, Plath, Rich, and Olds on Life with Daddy''] (2003) Gale Swiontkowski, Susquehanna University Press, p26 {{ISBN|9781575910611}}</ref> This abuse was disputed in interviews with her mother and other relatives.<ref>Middlebrook, pp. 56–60.</ref> Orne wrote that hypnosis in an adult frequently does not present accurate memories of childhood; instead, "adults under hypnosis are not literally reliving their early childhoods but presenting them through the prisms of adulthood."<ref>{{cite news |title=Martin Orne, 76, Psychiatrist and Expert on Hypnosis, Dies |last=Nagourney |first=Eric |date=2000-02-17 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/17/us/martin-orne-72-psychiatrist-and-expert-on-hypnosis-dies.html |work=The New York Times |access-date=2009-01-06 }}</ref> According to Orne, Anne Sexton was extremely suggestible and would mimic the symptoms of the patients around her in the mental hospitals to which she was committed. Diane Middlebrook's biography states that a separate personality named Elizabeth emerged in Sexton while under hypnosis. Orne did not encourage this development and subsequently this "alternate personality" disappeared. Orne eventually concluded that Anne Sexton was suffering from [[hysteria]].<ref name="Middlebrook" /> During the writing of the Middlebrook biography, her daughter, [[Linda Gray Sexton]], stated that she had been sexually assaulted by her mother.<ref Name=Daddy/><ref name="Hausman">{{cite journal |last=Hausman |first=Ken |journal=The Psychiatric News |date=1991-09-06 |title=Psychiatrist Criticized Over Release Of Poet's Psychotherapy Tapes |url=http://www.dianemiddlebrook.com/sexton/tpn9-6.html |access-date=2009-05-13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321225256/http://dianemiddlebrook.com/sexton/tpn9-6.html |archive-date=2009-03-21 }}</ref> In 1994, she published her autobiography ''Searching for Mercy Street: My Journey Back to My Mother, Anne Sexton'', which includes her own accounts of the abuse.<ref>Sexton, Linda Gray (1994) ''Searching for Mercy Street: My Journey Back to My Mother, Anne Sexton''. Little Brown & Co. {{ISBN|0-316-78207-6}}</ref><ref name="Kakutani"/>

Middlebrook published her controversial biography of Anne Sexton with the approval of daughter Linda, Anne's literary executor.<ref name="Middlebrook" /> For use in the biography, Orne had given Diane Middlebrook most of the tapes recording the therapy sessions between Orne and Anne Sexton. The use of these tapes was met with, as ''The New York Times'' put it, "thunderous condemnation".<ref name="pollitt-nyt" /> Middlebrook received the tapes after she had written a substantial amount of the first draft of Sexton's biography, and decided to start over. Although Linda Gray Sexton collaborated with the Middlebrook biography, other members of the Sexton family were divided over the book, publishing several editorials and op-ed pieces in ''The New York Times'' and ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]''.

Controversy continued with the posthumous public release of the tapes (which had been subject to [[Physician–patient privilege|doctor-patient confidentiality]]). They are said to reveal Sexton's molestation of her daughter Linda,<ref>{{cite news | title=Poet Told All; Therapist Provides the Record | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/15/books/poet-told-all-therapist-provides-the-record.html?sec=health}}</ref><ref name="Kakutani">{{cite news |first=Michiko |last=Kakutani |author-link=Michiko Kakutani |date=October 14, 1994 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/14/books/books-of-the-times-a-daughter-revisits-sexton-s-bedlam.html?pagewanted=1&pagewanted=print |title=Books of the Times; A Daughter Revisits Sexton's Bedlam |work=The New York Times}},</ref> her physically violent behavior toward both her daughters, and her physical altercations with her husband.<ref name="Hausman" />

Further controversy surrounds allegations that she had an "affair with" the therapist who replaced Orne in the 1960s.<ref>{{cite news |last=Morrow |first=Lance |title=Pains of The Poet—And Miracles |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=1991-09-23 |author-link=Lance Morrow |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,973887-1,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121101931/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,973887-1,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 21, 2011 |access-date=2009-01-18 }}</ref> No action was taken to censure or discipline the second therapist. Orne considered the "affair" with the second therapist (given the pseudonym "Ollie Zweizung" by Middlebrook and Linda Sexton) to be the catalyst that eventually resulted in her suicide.<ref name=carroll />

==Legacy==
[[Peter Gabriel]] dedicated his song "[[Mercy Street]]" (named for her play ''Mercy Street'' and inspired by his reading of her poem "45 Mercy Street") from his 1986 album, ''[[So (album)|So]]'', to Sexton.<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/so-19860814 | title= So | work=Rolling Stone | first=Tim | last=Holmes | date=1986-08-14 | access-date=24 June 2015}}</ref> She has been described as a "personal touchstone" for [[Morrissey]], former lead singer and lyricist of [[The Smiths]].<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/22/morrissey-live-review-cardiff-observer-new-model | title= Morrissey review – in shockingly good voice throughout | work=The Guardian | first=Ben | last=Thompson | date=2015-03-22 | access-date=24 June 2015}}</ref> She is commemorated on the [[Boston Women's Heritage Trail]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Back Bay East|url=http://bwht.org/back-bay-east/|website=Boston Women's Heritage Trail}}</ref> She has also been cited as muse for Madonna, who has talked about her in interviews over the years.
