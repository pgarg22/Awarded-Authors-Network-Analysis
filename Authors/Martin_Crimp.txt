'''Martin Andrew Crimp''' (born 14 February 1956 in [[Dartford]], Kent) is a British playwright.

Crimp is sometimes described as a practitioner of the "[[In-yer-face theatre|in-yer-face]]" school of contemporary British drama, although he rejects the label.<ref>Harriet Devine ''Looking Back'' 2006</ref> He is notable for the astringency of his dialogue, a tone of emotional detachment, a bleak view of human relationships – none of his characters experience love or joy – and latterly, a concern for theatrical form and language rather than an interest in narrative.

Crimp's work has successfully received numerous productions abroad. In [[Germany]] he is considered to be "one of the most respected British playwrights" and it was reported in 2013 that there has been "more than 60 German-language productions of his work in the past two decades."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sierz |first1=Aleks |title=The Theatre of Martin Crimp |date=2013 |publisher=Bloomsbury Methuen Drama |isbn=978-1472517012 |pages=xii |edition=Second |url=https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/The_Theatre_of_Martin_Crimp/A30fAgAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=The%20theatre%20of%20martin%20crimp&pg=PR12&printsec=frontcover}}</ref>

==Career==
The son of John Crimp, a [[British Rail]] signalling engineer, and his wife Jennie, Crimp's family moved in 1960 to [[Streatham]] where he attended a local primary school before winning a scholarship to [[Dulwich College]]. But when his father was transferred to York, he went to the nearby [[Pocklington School]], where he showed an aptitude for languages, music, English literature and theatre. He read English at [[St Catharine's College, Cambridge]] (1975–78), where his first play ''Clang'' was staged by fellow student [[Roger Michell]].<ref>Aleks Sierz ''The Theatre of Martin Crimp'', Methuen, 2006</ref> Before establishing himself as a playwright, he put together ''An Anatomy'', a collection of short stories, and also wrote a novel ''Still Early Days''. These remain unpublished.

His first six plays were performed at the [[Orange Tree Theatre]] in Richmond. As he told [[Marsha Hanlon]] in an interview for the Orange Tree appeal brochure in 1991: "When the Orange Tree ran a workshop for local writers [in September 1981], I was invited to take part. The carrot was the chance of a lunchtime production, so I wrote ''Living Remains'' and the Orange Tree staged it – my first-ever produced play! I was so excited that I didn't think about the space where it was performed [then a room above a pub], but now I realise that the Orange Tree's intimacy and simplicity provided an extra layer of excitement."

Seven of his plays, and his second [[Eugène Ionesco|Ionesco]] translation have also been presented at the [[Royal Court Theatre]], London, where he became writer-in-residence in 1997. His plays are now frequently performed in Europe. He has also been an assiduous translator of European texts.

Possibly his most highly regarded, and certainly his boldest and most innovative play is ''Attempts on Her Life'', first performed at the Royal Court in 1997 and subsequently translated into twenty languages.

In this work, none of the lines is assigned to a particular character, nor does Crimp specify how many actors should perform the piece. In seventeen apparently disconnected scenes, groups of people give mutually contradictory descriptions of an absent protagonist, a woman talked of as if she were, variously, a terrorist, the daughter of grieving parents, an artist and a new car. This deliberately fragmented work challenges an audience to re-define its notion of what constitutes a "play" and might seem to question whether someone has any existence beyond the models we construct.
