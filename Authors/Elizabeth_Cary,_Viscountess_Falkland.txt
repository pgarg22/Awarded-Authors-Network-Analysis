'''Elizabeth Cary, Viscountess Falkland''' (''née'' '''Tanfield'''; 1585–1639), was an English poet, dramatist, translator and historian. She is the first woman known to have written and published an original play in English: [[The Tragedy of Mariam]]. From an early age, she was recognized as an accomplished scholar by writers of her time.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Elizabeth Tanfield was born in 1585 or 1586 at [[Burford Priory]] in [[Oxfordshire]], the only child of [[Lawrence Tanfield|Sir Lawrence Tanfield]] and his wife Elizabeth Symondes of Norfolk.<ref name="1586-1639. 2012">{{Cite book |title=The tragedy of Mariam, the fair queen of Jewry |last=1586-1639. |first=Cary, Elizabeth, Lady, 1585 or |date=2012 |publisher=Arden Shakespeare |others=Wray, Ramona, 1971- |isbn=9781904271598 |edition= New |location=London |oclc=798312313}}</ref> Her father was a lawyer, who eventually became a judge and [[Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer]]. Her parents were very supportive of their daughter's love for reading and learning, which was so great that her mother forbade the servants from giving Elizabeth candles to read by at night.

Elizabeth's parents employed a French instructor for her when she was five years old. Five weeks later, she was speaking fluently. After excelling in French, she insisted on learning Spanish, Italian, Latin, Hebrew, and Transylvanian on her own, without an instructor.<ref>Cary, Elizabeth, Barry Weller, and Margaret W. Ferguson.

Her father arranged her marriage at the age of 15 to [[Henry Cary, 1st Viscount Falkland|Sir Henry Cary]], later [[Viscount Falkland]], who married her because she was an heiress. When she finally moved into her husband's home, her mother-in-law informed Cary that she was forbidden to read, so she instead chose to write poetry in her spare time.

It was not until seven years after they were married that Lord and Lady Falkland had children; they would go on to have a total of eleven: [[James Home, 2nd Earl of Home|Catherine]] (1609–1625), [[Lucius Cary, 2nd Viscount Falkland|Lucius]] (1610–1643; became the second Viscount Falkland), Lorenzo (1613–1642), [[Anne Cary|Anne]] (c.1614–1671),<ref name=anneodnb/> Edward (1616–1616), Elizabeth (1617–1683), [[Lucy Cary|Lucy]] (1619–1650), Victoria (1620–1692), Mary (1621–1693), Henry (1622 – date unknown), and [[Patrick Cary|Patrick]] (1623–1657).

In 1622 her husband was appointed Lord Deputy of Ireland and Elizabeth Cary joined him in Dublin. There she socialized with prominent local Catholics and patronized Catholic writers. This may have contributed to her conversion to Catholicism.<ref name="1586-1639. 2012"/>

Five of her children (Anne, Elizabeth, Lucy, Mary, and Henry) joined the Catholic church in their parents' lifetime.

===Later years===
By 1625 Elizabeth Cary had been disinherited by her father, just before he died, for using part of her [[jointure]] to meet expenses. The money that was initially meant for her had gone instead to her eldest son, Lucius, who was strapped with debt. The disinheritance came after she had tried to boost her husband as he struggled to pay for his lands in Ireland. The same year she returned from Ireland and publicly announced her conversion to Catholicism in 1626, which resulted in her husband's making an unsuccessful attempt to divorce her, although he managed to deny her access to their children. Despite several orders of the Privy Council, he refused her maintenance in an apparent effort to force her to recant. In 1627 her residence was Cote House in Oxford.<ref>A. P. Baggs, Eleanor Chance, Christina Colvin, C. J. Day, Nesta Selwyn and S. C. Townley. "Aston and Cote: Nonconformity", ''A History of the County of Oxford: Volume 13, Bampton Hundred (Part One)'', eds. Alan Crossley and C. R. J. Currie. London: Victoria County History, 1996. 77–78. [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/oxon/vol13/pp77-78 British History Online] Retrieved 2 August 2021.</ref>

Her husband died in 1633, and she sought to regain custody of her children. She was questioned in the [[Star Chamber]] for kidnapping her sons (she had previously, and more easily, gained custody of her daughters), but although she was threatened with imprisonment there is no record of any punishment. In 1634 Elizabeth, Mary, Lucy and [[Anne Cary]] were converted to the Catholic faith by [[John Fursdon]], who was their mother's confessor. [[Edward Barrett, 1st Lord Barrett of Newburgh|Edward Barrett, Lord Barrett]] reported this to King Charles I and he agreed for the four girls to be removed from their mother's house and taken to [[Great Tew]].<ref name=anneodnb>[[Heather Wolfe]], "Cary, Anne (bap. 1614, d. 1671)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, May 2014 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/105828, accessed 7 April 2017].</ref> Great Tew had been inherited by her son [[Lucius Cary, 2nd Viscount Falkland|Lucius Cary]], who was then [[Viscount Falkland]].<ref name=bruv>[http://bcw-project.org/biography/lucius-cary-viscount-falkland Lucius Cary, Viscount Falkland], BCW project, Retrieved 7 April 2017.</ref>

Elizabeth Cary was an avid and secretive reader from a young age, in part due to her attempt to understand Protestantism. Some of her understanding of religious texts was directly influenced by her understanding of literature. Once fully in step with Catholicism, she dedicated herself to guiding her children towards the Roman Catholic Church by "opening channels for God and paths for her children, but making sure she didn't block the road by loitering in the middle of it herself."<ref>Peter Freeman, "The Unhidden Faith of Lady Falkland". ''Crisis Magazine, a Voice for the Faithful Catholic Laity'', 23 June 2011. Web.</ref> Her eldest daughter, Catherine, reported an apparition of the Virgin Mary while on her deathbed. This apparent sighting deeply moved Cary and only furthered her mission to convert all of her children, as Catherine had still been a Protestant at the time of her death. By the end of Cary's life her mission had become partially successful; four of her daughters went on to become Benedictine nuns and one of her sons joined the priesthood.<ref name=anneodnb/>

In 1639, Elizabeth Cary, Lady Falkland, died in London. She remains buried in Henrietta Maria's Chapel in Somerset House.<ref>"Elizabeth Cary, Viscountess Falkland, writer, Translator & Catholic Recusant."

==Writing==
According to the biography by her daughter, Elizabeth Cary saw poetry as the highest literary form. Many of her poems have been lost, but her dedication to poetry is clear in all her plays. Her first or possibly second play, [[The Tragedy of Mariam|''The Tragedy of Mariam, the Fair Queen of Jewry'']] (1613),<ref>Simon Barker, Hilary Hinds (eds.), ''The Routledge Anthology of Renaissance Drama'', Routledge, Abingdon (2003), p. 194: "Cary seems to have written an earlier play, now lost, set in Sicily and dedicated to her husband (hence the reference to 'my first' in l. 13 [of the dedication to ''Mariam'']".</ref> was written in iambic pentameters with the use of couplets and of irony throughout. The change in pattern and rhyme scheme show multiple sonnets throughout the play, irony being a traditional element of the sonnet. ''The Tragedy of Mariam'' was progressive for its time as the first original English play to be published by a woman.<ref name=Hodgson-Wright>Stephanie Hodgson-Wright, "http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4835 Cary, Elizabeth, Viscountess Falkland (1585–1639)]", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', ed. H. C. G. Matthew and Brian Harrison. Oxford: OUP, 2004. 15 November 2006.</ref>

Elizabeth Cary then wrote ''The History of the Life, Reign, and Death of Edward II'' (1626/1627), which was a political fable based on historical events. It was not published until 1680, long after her death.<ref name=Hodgson-Wright/> The text uses the story of King Edward II and his powerful favourites, Gaveston and Spencer, as an analogy for King Charles, who in the 1620s was in conflict with Parliament about the power granted to the [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]]. Cary was in constant contact with Buckingham and his family. Writing ''The History'' may have been her way to cope with having to rely constantly on Buckingham and his family. She focuses on the idea of favouritism throughout the piece and how it can lead to disastrous outcomes. Other than the ''Tragedy of Mariam'' and the ''History'', much of Falkland's original work has been lost, including most of her poetry.<ref name=Hodgson-Wright/>
