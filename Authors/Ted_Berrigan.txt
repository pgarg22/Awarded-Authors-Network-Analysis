'''Ted Berrigan''' (November 15, 1934 – July 4, 1983) was an [[American poet]].

==Early life==
Berrigan was born in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], Rhode Island, on November 15, 1934. After high school, he spent a year at [[Providence College]] before joining the [[U.S. Army]]. After three years in the Army, he finished his college studies at the [[University of Tulsa]] in [[Oklahoma]], where he received a [[B.A.]] in [[English studies|English]] in 1959 and fell just short of the requirements for an [[M.A.]] in 1962. Berrigan was married to Sandy Berrigan, also a poet, and they had two children: David Berrigan and Kate Berrigan. He and his second wife, the poet [[Alice Notley]], were active in the poetry scene in [[Chicago]] for several years, then moved to [[New York City]], where he edited various magazines (notably, founding "C" magazine in 1984)<ref>{{cite web |title=Ted Berrigan |url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/ted-berrigan |website=[[Poetry Foundation]] |access-date=12 September 2021}}</ref> and books.

==The New York School==
A prominent figure in the second generation of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] of Poets, Berrigan was peer to [[Jim Carroll]], [[Anselm Hollo]], [[Alice Notley]], [[Ron Padgett]], [[Anne Waldman]], [[Bernadette Mayer]], and [[Lewis Warsh]]. He collaborated with Padgett and [[Joe Brainard]] on ''Bean Spasms'', a work significant in its rejection of traditional concepts of ownership. Though Berrigan, Padgett, and Brainard all wrote individual poems for the book, and collaborated on many others, no authors were listed for individual poems.

In 2005, Ted Berrigan's published and unpublished poetry was published together in a single volume edited by the poet [[Alice Notley]], Berrigan's second wife, and their two sons, [[Anselm Berrigan]], a poet, and Edmund Berrigan, a poet and songwriter.

==''The Sonnets''==
The poet [[Frank O'Hara]] called Berrigan's most significant publication, ''The Sonnets,'' "a fact of modern poetry."  A telling reflection of the era that produced it, ''The Sonnets'' beautifully weaves together traditional elements of the Shakespearean sonnet form with the disjunctive structure and cadence of [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Waste Land]]'' and Berrigan's own literary innovations and personal experiences. In the words of Berrigan's editor and second wife Alice Notley, the product was a composition "[that is] musical, sexy, and funny."

Berrigan was initially drawn to the sonnet form because of its inherent challenge; in his own words, "the form sort of [stultifies] the whole process [of writing]."  The procedure that he ultimately concocted to write ''The Sonnets'' is the essence of the work's novelty and ingenuity.  After attempting several sonnets, Berrigan decided to go back through what he had written and take out certain lines, one line from each work until he had six lines. He then went through the poems backwards and took one more line from each until he had accumulated six more lines, twelve lines total. Based on this body of the work, Berrigan knew what the final couplet would be; this process became the basis for The Sonnets.  Addressing claims that the method is utterly mechanical, Berrigan explains that some of the seventy-seven sonnets came to him "whole," without needing to be pieced together.  The poet's preoccupation with style, his concern for form and his own role as the creator, as evinced by ''The Sonnets,'' pose a challenge to traditional ideas about poetry and signify a fresh and innovative artistic approach.

The book recognizes the eternal possibility for invention in a genre seemingly overwhelmed by the success of its traditional forms{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}.  By imitating the forms and practices of earlier artists and recreating them to express personal ideas and experiences, Berrigan demonstrates the potential for poetry in his and subsequent generations.  As [[Charles Bernstein]] succinctly comments, "Part collage, part process writing, part sprung lyric, Ted Berrigan's ''The Sonnets'' remains…one of the freshest and most buoyantly inspired works of contemporary poetry.  Reinventing verse for its time, ''The Sonnets'' are redolent with possibilities for our own.”

==Death==
Berrigan died on July 4, 1983 at the age of 48. The cause of death was cirrhosis of the liver brought on by hepatitis.
