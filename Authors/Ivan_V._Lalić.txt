'''Ivan V. Lalić''' (June 8, 1931 – July 28, 1996) was a [[Serbs|Serbian]] and [[Yugoslavs|Yugoslav]] poet.<ref name="Obituary, The Independent">[https://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19960802/ai_n14070772 Obituary, ''The Independent'']{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Aug 2, 1996, Celia Hawkesworth</ref> He was also a translator of poetry from English, French and German into his mother tongue.

==Biography==
Lalić was born in [[Belgrade]]; his father, Vlajko, was a journalist, and his grandfather [[Isidor Bajić]] was a composer. His poems tell of a happy childhood, but also of two teenage traumas. As a child in Belgrade, many of his school-friends perished in a 1944 air-raid - as described in the poem "Zardjala igla (A rusty needle)". Lalić said that "my childhood and boyhood in the war marked everything I ever wrote as a poem or poetry".<ref>[http://www.bookrags.com/biography/ivan-v-lalic-dlb/ Bookrags.com]</ref>  A second trauma was the loss of his mother, Ljubica Bajić, from tuberculosis in 1946.

Ivan V. Lalić finished high school in [[Zagreb]], where he studied law. Here he met his wife Branka (née Kašnar), who was studying English and music. They married in 1956. Ivan described her as "the spirit behind my poems",<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://riznicasrpska.net/knjizevnost/index.php?topic=320.0|title=Poezija « Srpski pesnici XX i XXI veka — biografsko-bibliografski podaci i prilozi « Ivan V. Lalić (1931—1996)|last=Angelina|website=Riznica srpska - Književnost|access-date=16 April 2018}}</ref> and her presence remains in his verse at all stages of his poetic oeuvre.

Ivan V. Lalić published his first poems in 1952, and his first collection of poetry in 1955; the last appeared in 1996, the year of his death. After initially working as a literary editor for Radio Zagreb, he moved to Belgrade in 1961 to take up a new post: Secretary of the Yugoslav Writer's Union. Then, from 1979 until his retirement in 1993, he worked as an editor for the Nolit publishing house in Belgrade.<ref name=":0" />

Ivan and Branka Lalić spent the summers with their family in the Istrian town of [[Rovinj]]. They had two sons. The elder, Vlajko, died in a sailing accident between Rovinj and Venice in 1989.<ref name=":0" /> Ivan V. Lalić died suddenly in Belgrade in 1996. He was survived by his wife Branka, and his younger son Marko.

== Thought and themes ==
In her obituary of Lalić, Celia Hawkesworth spoke of "the central place in his work of memory: fragile in the face of the collapse of civilisations, but all we have. Memory allows the poet to recreate brief instants of personal joy as well as to conjure up a sense of the distant past. It allows each of us, as individuals condemned to solitude, to connect with a shared inheritance and feel, for a moment, part of a larger whole."<ref name="Obituary, The Independent"/>

==Legacy==
Lalić is recognised as one of Yugoslavia’s and Serbia’s most accomplished poets. In Aleksandar Jovanović’s words, “his work does not only stand at the peak of Serbian poetry in the second half of [the 20th] century, but is at the peak of Serbian poetry in general”.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Petković |first1=Novica |last2=Jovanović |first2=Aleksandar |title=Postsimbolistička poetika Ivana V Lalića [The Post-Symbolist Poetics of Ivan V Lalić] |date=2007 |publisher=Institut za književnost i umetnost - Učiteljski fakultet. |location=Belgrade |pages=12}}</ref>

Lalić was admired abroad and books of his poems have been translated into six languages (English, French, Italian, Polish, Hungarian and Macedonian). Individual poems have appeared in more than 20 languages. UK critics have described his work as "vital and intense",<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gahagan |first1=Judy |title=Review of ‘Fading Contact’, Ivan Lalić, Anvil |journal=Ambit |date=2001}}</ref> with a "magisterial transcendent quality",<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gahagan |title=Review of ‘Fading Contact’}}</ref> and his "lyrics [as] ablaze with successes of metaphor",<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bird |first1=Michael |title=Histories of absence: Ivan V. Lalić, The Works of Love, tr. Francis R. Jones (Anvil) |journal=PN Review |date=1984 |volume=30 |issue=4, March – April}}</ref> with an "irresistible blend of private lyricism and public force".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=O’Donaghue |first1=Bernard |title=What’s gained in translation |journal=Poetry News |date=1997 |page=9}}</ref>

Lalić also produced two selections of his work:
* ''Vreme, vatre, vrtovi'' (‘Time, Fires, Gardens’, 1961). This includes the complete ''Melisa'', plus poems selected from his other four early books, including ''Argonauti i druge pesme''. In this volume, Lalić defined the early poems that he saw as part of his poetic legacy, and set aside what he saw as slighter juvenilia: he regarded it not as “a book of selected poems, but […] his first real book”.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dela|last=Lalić|volume=I|pages=333}}</ref>
*''Izabrane i nove pesme'' (‘Selected and New Poems’, 1969) – published in English translation as ''A Rusty Needle''. The “selected” poems are largely from ''Vreme, vatre, vrtovi'' and his two subsequent books ''Čin'' and ''Krug.'' The “new” poems form the cycle ''O delima ljubavi, ili Vizantija'' (‘Of the Works of Love, or Byzantium’).
