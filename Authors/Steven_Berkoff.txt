==Career==
===Theatre===
Berkoff started his theatre training in the Repertory Company at [[Barrow-in-Furness#Arts|Her Majesty's Theatre]] in [[Barrow-in-Furness]], for approximately two months, in June and July 1962.<ref>[[Peter Purves]]' autobiography "Here's One I Wrote Earlier...", hardback edition, Green Umbrella Publishing, page 70. {{ISBN|978-1-906635-34-3}}.</ref>

As well as an actor, Berkoff is a noted [[playwright]] and [[theatre director]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/steven-berkoff-rise-of-an-up-and-coming-nobody-2081629.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Arifa | last=Akbar | title=Steven Berkoff: Rise of an 'up and coming nobody' | date=17 September 2010}}</ref> His earliest plays are adaptations of works by [[Franz Kafka]]: ''[[The Metamorphosis]]'' (1969); ''[[In the Penal Colony]]'' (1969), and ''[[The Trial]]'' (1971). In the 1970s and 1980s, he wrote a series of verse plays including ''[[East (play)|East]]'' (1975), ''[[Greek (play)|Greek]]'' (1980), and ''Decadence'' (1981), followed by ''West'' (1983) (later adapted and recorded at [[Limehouse Studios]] for transmission on [[Channel 4]] in 1983), ''Harry's Christmas (Lunch)'' (also recorded at Limehouse Studios in 1983 but was never transmitted by C4 as it was considered "too dark"), Villan in Beverly Hills Cop 1984,''[[Sink the Belgrano!]]'' (1986), ''Massage'' (1997), and ''The Secret Love Life of Ophelia'' (2001). Berkoff described ''Sink the Belgrano!'' as "even by my modest standards... one of the best things I have done".<ref>Steven Berkoff, "Free Association: An Autobiography", ''Faber and Faber'', 1 July 1996, p.373. {{ISBN|978-0571176083}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iainfisher.com/berkoff/berkoff-filmed.html|title=Steven Berkoff filmed - Iain Fisher|website=Steven Berkoff|language=en-US|access-date=2020-06-23}}</ref>

Drama critic [[Aleks Sierz]] describes Berkoff's dramatic style as "[[In-yer-face theatre]]":
{{bquote|The language is usually filthy, characters talk about unmentionable subjects, take their clothes off, have sex, humiliate each other, experience unpleasant emotions, become suddenly violent. At its best, this kind of theatre is so powerful, so visceral, that it forces audiences to react: either they feel like fleeing the building or they are suddenly convinced that it is the best thing they have ever seen and want all their friends to see it too. It is the kind of theatre that inspires us to use superlatives, whether in praise or condemnation.<ref name=Sierz>{{cite book|author=Aleks Sierz|title=In-Yer-Face Theatre: British Drama Today|location=London|publisher=[[Faber and Faber]]|year=2001|isbn=978-0-571-20049-8|pages=25–26}}</ref>}}

In a 2010 interview with guest presenter [[Emily Maitlis]] on ''[[The Andrew Marr Show]]'', Berkoff stated that he found it "flattering" to play evil characters, saying that the best actors assumed villainous roles.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10831364|title=Evil roles are 'flattering' |work=BBC News | date=1 August 2010}}</ref> In 2011, Berkoff revived a previously performed one-man show at the [[Hammersmith]] [[Riverside Studios]], titled ''One Man''.

The Berkoff Performing Arts Centre at [[Alton College]], [[Hampshire]], is named for Berkoff.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altoncollege.ac.uk/images/front-of-berkoff-performing-arts-centre|title=Front of Berkoff Performing Arts Centre|work=altoncollege.ac.uk}}</ref> Attending the Alton College ceremony to honour him, he stated:
{{cquote|I remember in my younger days questioning what life means. Finding a place like the Berkoff Performing Arts Centre, I found myself as a person. Having a place like this sowed the seeds of the man I think I am today. A place like this is the first step in changing the life of a person. There's something about theatre that draws people together because it's something connected with the human soul. All over the UK, the performing arts links people with a shared humanity as a way to open the doors to the mysteries of life. We should never underestimate the power of the theatre. It educates, informs, enlightens and humanises us all.}}
He taught a drama master-class later that day, and performed ''Shakespeare's Villains'' for an invited audience that evening.

==Personal life==
Berkoff married Alison Minto in 1970, and Shelley Lee in 1976; both marriages ended in divorce. He lives with his partner Clara Fischer, a German pianist, in [[Limehouse]], east London, having previously lived in [[Portsmouth]]. Fischer appeared onscreen with Berkoff in his film ''[[Decadence (film)|Decadence]]''. He has two daughters, Mylea and Sarah, from previous relationships.<ref name=BC/><ref name=Hollywood/>

===Defamation lawsuit===
In 1996, Berkoff won ''Berkoff vs. Burchill'', a [[Defamation|libel]] [[Law suit|civil action]] that he brought against ''[[The Sunday Times|Sunday Times]]'' journalist [[Julie Burchill]] after she published comments suggesting that he was "hideously ugly". The judge ruled for Berkoff, finding that Burchill's actions "held him to ridicule and contempt."<ref name=LunneyOliphant>{{cite book|author=Mark Lunney and Ken Oliphant|title=Tort Law: Text and Materials|location=London and New York|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|edition=3rd|year=2007|isbn=978-0-19-921136-4|page=704}}</ref>

===Political and religious views===
Berkoff has spoken and written about how he believes [[Jews]] and [[Israel]] to be regarded in Britain. In a January 2009 interview with ''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]'', in which he discussed [[Anti-Zionism|anti-Israel]] sentiment in the aftermath of the [[Gaza War (2008–2009)|Gaza War]], he said:{{Cquote|There is an in-built dislike of Jews. Overt [[antisemitism]] goes against the British sense of fair play. It has to be covert and civilised. So certain playwrights and actors on the [[left-wing politics|left wing]] make themselves out to be stricken with conscience. They say: 'We hate Israel, we hate [[Zionism]], we don't hate Jews.' But Zionism is the very essence of what a Jew is. Zionism is the act of seeking sanctuary after years and years of unspeakable outrages against Jews. As soon as Israel does anything over the top it's always the same old faces who come out to demonstrate. I don't see hordes of people marching down the street against [[Robert Mugabe|Mugabe]] when tens of thousands are [[Human rights in Zimbabwe|dying every month in Zimbabwe]].<ref name=JCcomJan2009>Simon Round, [http://www.thejc.com/lifestyle/the-simon-round-interview/11264/interview-steven-berkoff "Interview: Steven Berkoff"], ''The Jewish Chronicle'', 22 January 2009. Retrieved 2012-10-17.</ref>}} Interviewer Simon Round noted that Berkoff was also keen to express his view that [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] Israeli politicians, such as [[Ariel Sharon]] and [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], were "wretched".<ref name=JCcomJan2009 /> Asked if [[Antisemitism in the United Kingdom|British antisemitism]] manifested itself in theatre, Berkoff responded: "They quite like diversity and will tolerate you as long as you act a bit [[Gentile]] and don't throw your chicken soup around too much. You are perfectly entitled occasionally even to touch the great prophet of British culture, [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], as long as you keep your [[Jewishness]] well zipped up."<ref name=JCcomJan2009 /> Berkoff also referred to the Gaza war as a factor in writing ''Biblical Tales'': "It was the recent 'Gaza' war and the appalling flack that Israel received that prompted me to investigate ancient Jewish values."<ref>Steven Berkoff, [http://www.stevenberkoff.com/resources_biblical_tales.html "Press release for Biblical Tales"], ''New End Theatre''. Retrieved 17 October 2012.</ref>

Speaking to ''The Jewish Chronicle'' in May 2010, Berkoff criticised the [[Bible]] but added, "it inspires the Jews to produce [[Samson]]s and heroes and to have pride". Berkoff went on to say of the [[Talmud]] in the same article: "As Jews, we are so incredibly lucky to have the Talmud, to have a way of re-interpreting the [[Torah]]. So we no longer cut off hands, and slay animals, and stone women."<ref>Jessica Elgot, [http://www.thejc.com/arts/theatre/31983/the-bible-rewritten-steven-berkoff "The Bible, rewritten by Steven Berkoff"], ''The Jewish Chronicle'', 21 May 2010. Retrieved 17 October 2012.</ref>

In a ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Daily Telegraph]]'' travel article written while visiting Israel in 2007, Berkoff described [[Melanie Phillips]]' book ''[[Londonistan: How Britain Is Creating a Terror State Within]]'', as "quite overwhelming in its research and common sense. It grips me throughout the journey."<ref>Steven Berkoff, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/middleeast/israel/737452/A-tale-of-Tel-Aviv.html "A Tale of Tel Aviv"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 10 June 2007. Retrieved 17 October 2012.</ref>

In 2012, Berkoff, with others, wrote in support of Israel's national theatre, [[Habima Theatre|Habima]], performing in London.<ref>Arnold Wesker, Ronald Harwood, Maureen Lipman, Simon Callow, Louise Mensch MP, Steven Berkoff, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/10/we-welcome-israel-national-theatre "Letters: We Welcome Israel's National Theatre"], ''The Guardian'', 10 April 2012. Retrieved 17 October 2012.</ref>

==References in popular culture==
In the 1989 romantic comedy ''[[The Tall Guy]]'', struggling actor Dexter King ([[Jeff Goldblum]]) auditions unsuccessfully for an imaginary "Berkoff play" called ''England, My England''. In the audition, characters dressed as [[skinheads]] swear repetitively at each other and a folding table is kicked over. Afterwards, Dexter's agent Mary ([[Anna Massey]]) muses, "I think he's probably mad ..."

"I'm scared of Steven Berkoff" is a line in the lyrics of the song "[[Back to the Light#Track listing|I'm Scared]]" by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] guitarist [[Brian May]], issued on his 1993 debut solo album ''[[Back to the Light]]''.<ref name=BTTL>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Back-Light-Brian-May/dp/B000025TFY|title=Back to the Light|access-date=1 October 2008}}</ref> May has declared himself to be an admirer of Berkoff<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brianmay.com/brian/brianssb/brianssb.html|title=BRIAN'S SOAPBOX|work=brianmay.com}}</ref> and his wife, [[Anita Dobson]], has appeared in several of Berkoff's plays.
