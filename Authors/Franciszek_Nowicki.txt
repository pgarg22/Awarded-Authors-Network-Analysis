'''Franciszek Henryk Siła-Nowicki''' (29 January 1864, in [[Kraków]], [[Austrian Empire]] – 3 September 1935, in [[Zawoja]], [[Poland]]) was a [[Young Poland]] [[poet]], a [[mountaineer]], [[socialist]] activist, and designer of the ''[[Orla Perć]]'' (Eagle's Path) [[High Tatras|High]] [[Tatra Mountains|Tatras]] [[mountain trail]].

==Life==

Franciszek Nowicki was the son of [[Maksymilian Nowicki]] — a [[zoologist]] and pioneer Polish [[conservation movement|conservationist]] — and [[Antonina Kasparek]], sister of [[Franciszek Kasparek]], professor of [[international law]], [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of [[Jagiellonian University|Kraków University]], and founder of the first [[chair (academic)|chair]] in [[international law]] in Poland.

As a university student, Nowicki co-edited (with [[Kazimierz Tetmajer]], [[Andrzej Niemojewski]], [[Artur Górski]] and others) a [[socialist]]-leaning [[Magazine|journal]], ''[[Ognisko]]'' (Focus).  Some years later, he co-founded the Polish Socialist-Democratic Party (''[[Polska Partia Socjalistyczno-Demokratyczna]]'').  From 1894 he taught at a [[secondary school]] (''[[gimnazjum]]'').

On February 5, 1901, Nowicki proposed to ''[[Towarzystwo Tatrzańskie]]'' (the Tatras Society)  the building of ''[[Orla Perć]]'' (the Eagle's Trail), which was partly realized in 1903-07.  In 1902 he climbed to the then-as-yet-unnamed ''[[Przełęcz Nowickiego]]'' (Nowicki's Pass) in the ''[[Buczynowe Turnie]]'' [[Tatras]] peaks.

In 1924 Nowicki retired from teaching, and in 1934 he became an honorary member of the Polish Writers' Union (''[[Związek Zawodowy Literatów Polskich]]'').

==Writings==
Nowicki published [[poem]]s and stories and, in 1891, his sole little volume of ''Poems'' (''Poezje''), comprising two parts:  "The Tatras" ("''Tatry''") and "Songs of Time" ("''Pieśni czasu''").  He also [[translate]]d from [[German language|German]], e.g., [[Goethe]]'s [[idyll]] of ''[[Hermann and Dorothea]]''.  He ceased writing poetry following an unhappy romantic involvement.
