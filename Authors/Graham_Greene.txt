'''Henry Graham Greene''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|OM|CH}} (2 October 1904&nbsp;– 3 April 1991) was an English writer and journalist regarded by many as one of the leading English novelists of the 20th century.<ref name=Diemert5 /><ref name=Diemert183 /> Combining literary acclaim with widespread popularity, Greene acquired a reputation early in his lifetime as a major writer, both of serious [[Catholic literary revival|Catholic novels]], and of thrillers (or "entertainments" as he termed them). He was shortlisted, in 1966 and 1967, for the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]].<ref name="nobelprize1966">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/literature/1966.html|title=Candidates for the 1966 Nobel Prize in Literature}}</ref><ref name=Prize /> Through 67 years of writing, which included over 25 novels, he explored the conflicting moral and political issues of the modern world. He was awarded the 1968 [[Shakespeare Prize]] and the 1981 [[Jerusalem Prize]].

He converted to Catholicism in 1926 after meeting his future wife, [[Vivien Greene|Vivien Dayrell-Browning]].<ref name=Donaghy1983>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2TdlLjpyUdQC&pg=PA13|page=13|title=Graham Greene, an Introduction to His Writings|author=Henry J.

== Early years (1904–1922) ==

[[File:Graham Greene's Birthplace blue plaque crop.jpg|thumb|upright|Graham Greene's Birthplace blue plaque]]
Henry Graham Greene was born in 1904 in St John's House, a [[Boarding school|boarding house]] of [[Berkhamsted School]], Hertfordshire, where his father was house master.<ref name=berkhamsted-tour>{{cite book|last=Cook|first=John|title=A Glimpse of our History: a short guided tour of Berkhamsted|year=2009|publisher=Berkhamsted Town Council|url=http://www.berkhamsted.gov.uk/download/Heritage%20Leaflet.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927033250/http://www.berkhamsted.gov.uk/download/Heritage%20Leaflet.pdf|archive-date=27 September 2011}}</ref> He was the fourth of six children; his younger brother, [[Hugh Greene|Hugh]], became [[Director-General of the BBC]], and his elder brother, [[Raymond Greene|Raymond]], an eminent physician and mountaineer.

His parents, Charles Henry Greene and Marion Raymond Greene, were [[cousin marriage|first cousins]], both members of a large, influential family that included the owners of [[Greene King Brewery]], bankers, and statesmen; his mother was cousin to [[Robert Louis Stevenson]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jY8x2_xQG1MC&pg=PA8|page=8|title=The Man Within My Head: Graham Greene, My Father and Me|author=Pico Iyer|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|date= 5 January 2012|isbn=9781408829028}}</ref>
Charles Greene was second master at Berkhamsted School, where the headmaster was [[Thomas Charles Fry|Dr Thomas Fry]], who was married to Charles' cousin. Another cousin was the right-wing pacifist [[Ben Greene]], whose politics led to his internment during World War II.

In his childhood, Greene spent his summers with his uncle, Sir [[William Graham Greene|Graham Greene]], at [[Harston#Harston House|Harston House]] in Cambridgeshire. In Greene's description of his childhood, he describes his learning to read there: "It was at Harston I found quite suddenly I could read—the book was ''Dixon Brett, Detective''. I didn't want anyone to know of my discovery, so I read only in secret, in a remote attic, but my mother must have spotted what I was at all the same, for she gave me Ballantyne's ''[[The Coral Island]]'' for the train journey home—always an interminable journey with the long wait between trains at [[Bletchley railway station|Bletchley]]…"

In 1910, Charles Greene succeeded Dr Fry as headmaster of Berkhamsted. Graham also attended the school as a boarder. Bullied and profoundly depressed, he made several suicide attempts, including, as he wrote in his autobiography, by [[Russian roulette]] and by taking aspirin before going swimming in the school pool. In 1920, aged 16, in what was a radical step for the time, he was sent for [[psychoanalysis]] for six months in London, afterwards returning to school as a day student.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jY8x2_xQG1MC&pg=PA9|page=9|title=The Man Within My Head: Graham Greene, My Father and Me|author=Pico Iyer|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|date= 5 January 2012|isbn=9781408829028}}</ref> School friends included [[Claud Cockburn]] the journalist, and [[Peter Quennell]] the historian.

Greene contributed several stories to the school magazine, one of which was published by a London evening newspaper in January 1921.

===Oxford University===
He attended [[Balliol College, Oxford]], to study history. During 1922 Greene was for a short time a member of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]], and sought an invitation to the new [[Soviet Union]], of which nothing came.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/Gi-He/Greene-Graham.html|title=Graham Greene Biography|work=notablebiographies.com|access-date=11 March 2016}}</ref> In 1925, while he was an undergraduate at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], his first work, a poorly received volume of poetry titled ''Babbling April'', was published.<ref name="G">{{cite web|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/Gi-He/Greene-Graham.html |title=Graham Greene Biography |publisher=Notablebiographies.com |access-date=2 June 2010}}</ref>

Greene suffered from periodic bouts of depression while at Oxford, and largely kept to himself.<ref name="oxforddnb.com">Michael Shelden, ‘Greene, (Henry) Graham (1904–1991)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Oct 2008 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/40460, accessed 15 May 2011]</ref> Of Greene's time at Oxford, his contemporary [[Evelyn Waugh]] noted that: "Graham Greene looked down on us (and perhaps all undergraduates) as childish and ostentatious. He certainly shared in none of our revelry."<ref name="oxforddnb.com" /> He graduated in 1925 with a [[British undergraduate degree classification|second-class degree]] in history.<ref name="G" />

== Writing career ==
After leaving Oxford, Greene worked for a period of time as a private tutor and then turned to journalism; first on the ''[[Nottingham Journal]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biogs.com/famous/greenegraham.html |title=Graham Greene |publisher=Biogs.com |access-date=2 June 2010}}</ref> and then as a [[copy editing|sub-editor]] on ''[[The Times]]''. While he was working in Nottingham, he started corresponding with [[Vivien Greene|Vivien Dayrell-Browning]], who had written to him to correct him on a point of Catholic doctrine. Greene was an agnostic, but when he later began to think about marrying Vivien, it occurred to him that, as he puts it in ''A Sort of Life'', he "ought at least to learn the nature and limits of the beliefs she held". Greene was baptised on 26 February 1926 and they married on 15 October 1927 at [[St Mary's Church, Hampstead]], [[North London]].

He published his first novel, ''[[The Man Within]]'', in 1929; its favourable reception enabled him to work full-time as a novelist. Greene originally divided his fiction into two genres (which he described as "entertainments" and "novels"): thrillers—often with notable philosophic edges—such as ''[[The Ministry of Fear]]''; and literary works—on which he thought his literary reputation would rest—such as ''[[The Power and the Glory]].''

The next two books, ''[[The Name of Action]]'' (1930) and ''[[Rumour at Nightfall]]'' (1932), were unsuccessful; and he later disowned them. His first true success was ''[[Stamboul Train]]'' (1932) which was taken on by the [[Book Society]] and adapted as the film ''[[Orient Express (1934 film)|Orient Express]]'', in 1934.

Although Greene objected strongly to being described as a [[Roman Catholic]] novelist, rather than as a novelist who happened to be Catholic, Catholic religious [[theme (literature)|themes]] are at the root of much of his writing, especially ''[[Brighton Rock (novel)|Brighton Rock]]'', ''The Power and the Glory'', ''[[The Heart of the Matter]]'', and ''[[The End of the Affair]]'';<ref name=mcgowin>[http://www.eclectica.org/v8n4/mcgowin_greene.html Graham Greene, The Major Novels: A Centenary] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140127085400/http://www.eclectica.org/v8n4/mcgowin_greene.html |date=27 January 2014 }} by [[Kevin McGowin]], ''[[Eclectica Magazine]]''</ref> which have been named "the gold standard" of the Catholic novel.<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=JMLSvJ096KQC&pg=PA3|page=3|title=Graham Greene's Catholic Imagination|author=Mark Bosco|publisher=Oxford University Press|date= 21 January 2005|isbn=9780198039358}}</ref> Several works, such as ''[[The Confidential Agent]]'', ''[[The Quiet American]]'', ''[[Our Man in Havana]]'', ''[[The Human Factor (novel)|The Human Factor]]'', and his screenplay for ''[[The Third Man]]'', also show Greene's avid interest in the workings and intrigues of international politics and espionage.

He supplemented his novelist's income with freelance journalism, book and film reviews for ''[[The Spectator]]'', and co-editing the magazine ''Night and Day''. Greene's 1937 film review<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thecharnelhouse.org/2014/02/25/graham-greenes-infamous-review-of-wee-willie-winkie-1937-starring-shirley-temple|title=Graham Greene's infamous review of Wee Willie Winkie (1937), starring Shirley Temple

By the 1950s, Greene had become known as one of the finest writers of his generation.<ref>{{cite book |last=Barrett |first=D. |year=2009 |chapter=Graham Greene |editor-first=A. |editor-last=Poole |title=The Cambridge Companion to English Novelists |url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgecompani00pool |url-access=limited |series=Cambridge Companions to Literature |pages=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgecompani00pool/page/n435 423]–437 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |doi=10.1017/CCOL9780521871198.027 |isbn=9780521871198 }}</ref><ref>[https://earlybirdbooks.com/must-read-graham-greene-books 13 Must-Read Graham Greene Books] ''earlybirdbooks.com'', accessed 31 October 2020</ref>

As his career lengthened, both Greene and his readers found the distinction between his 'entertainments' and novels increasingly problematic. The last book Greene termed an entertainment was ''[[Our Man in Havana]]'' in 1958.

Greene also wrote short stories and plays, which were well received, although he was always first and foremost a novelist. His first play, ''[[The Living Room (play)|The Living Room]]'', debuted in 1953.<ref name="Billington">{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/mar/13/living-room-review | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Michael | last=Billington | title=The Living Room—review | date=13 March 2013}}</ref>

[[Michael Korda]], a lifelong friend and later his editor at [[Simon & Schuster]], observed Greene at work: Greene wrote in a small black leather notebook with a black fountain pen and would write approximately 500 words. Korda described this as Graham's daily penance—once he finished he put the notebook away for the rest of the day.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Another Life: A Memoir of Other People|last = Korda|first = Michael|publisher = Random House|year = 1999|isbn = 0-679-45659-7|location = United States|pages = [https://archive.org/details/anotherlifememoi00kord/page/312 312–325]|url = https://archive.org/details/anotherlifememoi00kord/page/312}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.booknotes.org/Watch/124611-1/Michael-Korda.aspx|title=Another Life: A Memoir of Other People Interview|last=Korda|first=Michael|date=11 July 1999|website=www.booknotes.org|publisher=C-Span|access-date=30 December 2016}}</ref>

=== Travel and espionage ===

Throughout his life, Greene travelled to what he called the world's wild and remote places. In 1941, the travels led to his being recruited into [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] by his sister, Elisabeth, who worked for the agency. Accordingly, he was posted to [[Sierra Leone]] during the Second World War.<ref>Christopher Hawtree.

In 1953, the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|Holy Office]] informed Greene that ''The Power and the Glory'' was damaging to the reputation of the priesthood; but later, in a private audience with Greene, [[Pope Paul VI]] told him that, although parts of his novels would offend some Catholics, he should ignore the criticism.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1005484.stm |title=EUROPE &#124; Vatican's bid to censure Graham Greene |work=BBC News |date=3 November 2000 |access-date=2 June 2010}}</ref>

In 1957, just months after [[Fidel Castro]] began his final revolutionary assault on the [[Fulgencio Batista|Batista regime]] in [[Cuba]], Greene played a small role in helping the revolutionaries, as a secret courier transporting warm clothing for Castro's rebels hiding in the hills during the Cuban winter.<ref name="WashPost041491">{{cite news |last=Miller |first=Tom |date=14 April 1991 |title=Sex, Spies and Literature; Graham Greene's Cuba: Helping Fidel Was the Heart of the Matter |newspaper=Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1991/04/14/sex-spies-and-literature/77b162a4-2d48-4d5c-8dc6-3c44e9ebebd0/ }}</ref> Greene was said to have a fascination with strong leaders, which may have accounted for his interest in Castro, whom he later met. After one visit Castro gave Greene a painting he had done, which hung in the living room of the French house where the author spent the last years of his life.<ref name="WashPost041491" /> Greene did later voice doubts about Castro's Cuba, telling a French interviewer in 1983, "I admire him for his courage and his efficiency, but I question his authoritarianism," adding: "All successful revolutions, however idealistic, probably betray themselves in time."<ref name="WashPost041491" />

=== Publishing career ===

Between 1944 and 1948, Greene was director at [[Eyre & Spottiswoode]] under chairman [[Douglas Francis Jerrold|Douglas Jerrold]], in charge of developing its fiction list.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Greene|first=Richard|title=Graham Greene: A Life in Letters|year=2011}}</ref> Greene created ''The Century Library'' series, which was discontinued after he left following a conflict with Jerrold regarding [[Anthony Powell]]'s contract.

== Personal life ==

Greene was an atheist, but was baptised into the Catholic faith in 1926 after meeting his future wife [[Vivien Greene|Vivien Dayrell-Browning]].<ref name=Donaghy1983/> They were married on 15 October 1927 at [[St Mary's Church, Hampstead]], [[North London]].  The Greenes had two children, Lucy Caroline (born 1933) and Francis (born 1936).  

In his discussions with Father Trollope, the priest to whom he went for instruction in [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]], Greene argued with the cleric "on the ground of dogmatic atheism", as Greene's primary difficulty with religion was what he termed the "if" surrounding God's existence. He found, however, that "after a few weeks of serious argument the 'if' was becoming less and less improbable",<ref name="Pearce">Joseph Pearce. [http://www.catholicauthors.com/greene.html "Graham Greene: Doubter Par Excellence"], CatholicAuthors.com. Retrieved 7 January 2011.</ref> and Greene was converted and baptized after vigorous arguments initially with the priest in which he defended [[atheism]], or at least the "if" of [[agnosticism]].<ref>''The Power and the Glory'' New York: Viking, 1990. Introduction by [[John Updike]], p. xiv.</ref> Late in life, Greene called himself a "Catholic agnostic".<ref name="Sweeney2008" />

== Final years ==
[[File:Graham Greene grave in Corseaux.JPG|thumb|Gravestone at [[Corseaux]], Switzerland]]

After falling victim to a financial swindler, Greene chose to leave Britain in 1966, moving to [[Antibes]], to be close to Yvonne Cloetta, whom he had known since 1959, a relationship that endured until his death. In 1973, he had an uncredited [[cameo appearance]] as an insurance company representative in [[François Truffaut]]'s film ''[[Day for Night (film)|Day for Night]]''. In 1981, Greene was awarded the [[Jerusalem Prize]], awarded to writers concerned with the freedom of the individual in society.

He lived the last years of his life in [[Vevey]], on Lake Geneva in Switzerland, the same town [[Charlie Chaplin]] was living in at this time. He visited Chaplin often, and the two were good friends.<ref name=Swissinfo>{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/specials/extraordinary_exiles/Graham_Greene_finds_no_Swiss_cuckoo_clocks.html?cid=12832 |title=Graham Greene finds no Swiss cuckoo clocks |publisher=Swissinfo.ch |date=19 May 2006 |access-date=2 June 2010}}</ref> His book ''[[Doctor Fischer of Geneva|Doctor Fischer of Geneva or the Bomb Party]]'' (1980) is based on themes of combined philosophical and geographical influences. He ceased going to mass and confession in the 1950s, but in his final years began to receive the sacraments again from Father Leopoldo Durán, a Spanish priest, who became a friend.

In one of his final works, a pamphlet titled ''J'Accuse: The Dark Side of Nice'' (1982), Greene wrote of a legal matter that embroiled him and his extended family in [[Nice]], and declared that organised crime flourished in Nice because the city's upper levels of civic government protected judicial and police corruption. The accusation provoked a libel lawsuit that Greene lost;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/00/02/20/specials/greene-riviera.html|title=On the Riviera, A Morality Tale by Graham Greene|website=archive.nytimes.com}}</ref> but he was vindicated after his death when, in 1994, the former mayor of Nice, [[Jacques Médecin]], was imprisoned for corruption and associated crimes.

=== Death ===
In 1984, in celebration of his 80th birthday, the brewery which Greene's great-grandfather founded in 1799 made a special edition of its 'St. Edmunds' ale for him, with a special label in his honour.<ref name=Vinocur030385>{{cite magazine |last=Vinocur |first=John |date=3 March 1985 |title=The Soul-Searching Continues for Graham Greene: The celebrated writer; whose new book is a long-forgotten novella [''The Tenth Man''], still dwells on doubt and failure |magazine=[[New York Times Magazine]] |location=New York }}</ref> Commenting on turning 80, Greene said, "The big advantage...is that at 80 you are more likely these days to beat out encountering your end in a nuclear war", adding, "the other side of the problem is that I really don't want to survive myself [which] has nothing to do with nukes, but with the body hanging around while the mind departs."<ref name=Vinocur030385/>

In 1986, Greene was awarded Britain's [[Order of Merit]]. He died in 1991 at age 86 of [[leukaemia]]<ref name=mcgowin /> and was buried in [[Corseaux]] cemetery.<ref name=Swissinfo />

== Writing style and themes ==

Greene originally divided his fiction into two genres: [[thriller (genre)|thrillers]] ([[mystery (fiction)|mystery]] and [[suspense]] books), such as ''[[The Ministry of Fear]]'', which he described as entertainments, often with notable philosophic edges; and literary works, such as ''[[The Power and the Glory]]'', which he described as novels, on which he thought his literary reputation was to be based.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/authors/author/0,,-78,00.html |title=Greene, Graham &#124; Authors &#124; guardian.co.uk Books |publisher=Books.guardian.co.uk |date=22 July 2008 |access-date=2 June 2010 |location=London}}</ref>

As his career lengthened, both Greene and his readers found the distinction between "entertainments" and "novels" to be less evident. The last book Greene termed an entertainment was ''[[Our Man in Havana]]'' in 1958. When ''[[Travels with My Aunt]]'' was published eleven years later, many reviewers noted that Greene had designated it a novel, even though, as a work decidedly comic in tone, it appeared closer to his last two entertainments, ''[[Loser Takes All]]'' and ''Our Man in Havana'', than to any of the novels. Greene, they speculated, seemed to have dropped the category of entertainment. This was soon confirmed. In the ''Collected Edition'' of Greene's works published in 22 volumes between 1970 and 1982, the distinction between novels and entertainments is no longer maintained. All are novels.

Greene was one of the more "cinematic" of twentieth-century writers; most of his novels and many of his plays and short stories have been [[:Category:Films based on works by Graham Greene|adapted for film or television]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinema.ucla.edu/calendar/calendardetails.aspx?details_type=2&id=147 |title=Series Details |publisher=Cinema.ucla.edu |access-date=2 June 2010}}</ref> The [[Internet Movie Database]] lists 66 titles between 1934 and 2010 based on Greene material. Some novels were filmed more than once, such as ''[[Brighton Rock (novel)|Brighton Rock]]'' in 1947 and 2011, ''[[The End of the Affair]]'' in 1955 and 1999, and ''[[The Quiet American]]'' in [[The Quiet American (1958 film)|1958]] and [[The Quiet American (2002 film)|2002]]. The 1936 thriller ''[[A Gun for Sale]]'' was filmed at least five times under different titles. Greene received an [[Academy Award]] nomination for the screenplay for the 1948 [[Carol Reed]] film ''[[The Fallen Idol (film)|The Fallen Idol]]'', adapted from his own short story ''The Basement Room''. He also wrote several original screenplays. In 1949, after writing the novella as "raw material", he wrote the screenplay for a classic ''[[film noir]]'', ''[[The Third Man]]'', also directed by Carol Reed, and featuring [[Orson Welles]]. In 1983, ''[[The Honorary Consul]]'', published ten years earlier, was released as a film under its [[The Honorary Consul (film)|original title]], starring [[Michael Caine]] and [[Richard Gere]]. Author and screenwriter [[Michael Korda]] contributed a foreword and introduction to this novel in a commemorative edition.

In 2009, ''[[The Strand Magazine]]'' began to publish in serial form a newly discovered Greene novel titled ''The Empty Chair''. The manuscript was written in longhand when Greene was 22 and newly converted to Catholicism.

Greene's literary style was described by Evelyn Waugh in ''[[Commonweal (magazine)|Commonweal]]'' as "not a specifically literary style at all. The words are functional, devoid of sensuous attraction, of ancestry, and of independent life". Commenting on the lean prose and its readability, Richard Jones wrote in the ''[[Virginia Quarterly Review]]'' that "nothing deflects Greene from the main business of holding the reader's attention".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vqronline.org/articles/1979/spring/jones-improbable-spy |title=The Improbable Spy |publisher=Vqronline.org |access-date=2 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120100405/http://www.vqronline.org/articles/1979/spring/jones-improbable-spy/ |archive-date=20 November 2008 }}</ref> Greene's novels often have religious themes at their centre. In his literary criticism he attacked the [[Modernist literature|modernist]] writers [[Virginia Woolf]] and [[E. M. Forster]] for having lost the religious sense which, he argued, resulted in dull, superficial characters, who "wandered about like cardboard symbols through a world that is paper-thin".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/journal/ggbtps/FrstThing.htm |title=First Things |publisher=Angelfire.com |date=9 October 2004 |access-date=2 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111034929/http://www.angelfire.com/journal/ggbtps/FrstThing.htm |archive-date=11 November 2009 }}</ref> Only in recovering the religious element, the awareness of the drama of the struggle in the soul that carries the permanent consequence of salvation or damnation, and of the ultimate [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] realities of good and evil, sin and [[divine grace]], could the novel recover its dramatic power.

Pritchett]] praised Greene as the first English novelist since [[Henry James]] to present, and grapple with, the reality of evil.<ref name="Crisis">The Catholic Novels of Graham Greene, ''Crisis Magazine'', May 2005.</ref> Greene concentrated on portraying the characters' internal lives—their mental, emotional, and spiritual depths.

The novels often portray the dramatic struggles of the individual soul from a Catholic perspective. Greene was criticised for certain tendencies in an unorthodox direction—in the world, sin is omnipresent to the degree that the vigilant struggle to avoid sinful conduct is doomed to failure, hence not central to holiness. His friend and fellow Catholic [[Evelyn Waugh]] attacked that as a revival of the [[Quietism (Christian philosophy)|Quietist]] heresy. This aspect of his work also was criticised by the theologian [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]], as giving sin a mystique. Greene responded that constructing a vision of pure faith and goodness in the novel was beyond his talents. Praise of Greene from an orthodox Catholic point of view by Edward Short is in ''Crisis Magazine'',<ref name="Crisis" /> and a mainstream Catholic critique is presented by [[Joseph Pearce]].<ref name=Pearce />

Catholicism's prominence decreased in his later writings. The supernatural realities that haunted the earlier work declined and were replaced by a [[humanism|humanistic]] perspective, a change reflected in his public criticism of orthodox Catholic teaching.

In his later years, Greene was a strong critic of [[American imperialism]] and sympathised with the Cuban leader [[Fidel Castro]], whom he had met.<ref name="Kirjasto">{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/greene.htm |title=Graham Greene |website=Books and Writers |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050727074735/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/greene.htm |archive-date=27 July 2005 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Years before the Vietnam War, he prophetically attacked the idealistic but arrogant beliefs of ''[[The Quiet American]]'', whose certainty in his own virtue kept him from seeing the disaster he inflicted on the Vietnamese.<ref>For Greene's views on politics, see also {{cite journal |first=Anthony |last=Burgess |author-link=Anthony Burgess |title=Politics in the Novels of Graham Greene |journal=Journal of Contemporary History |volume=2 |issue=2 |year=1967 |pages=93–99 |doi=10.1177/002200946700200208 |s2cid=153416421 }}</ref> In ''[[Ways of Escape]]'', reflecting on his Mexican trip, he complained that Mexico's government was insufficiently left-wing compared with Cuba's.<ref name="P.xii of John Updike">P.xii of John Updike's introduction to ''The Power and the Glory'' New York: Viking, 1990.</ref> In Greene's opinion, "Conservatism and Catholicism should be ... impossible bedfellows".<ref name="P.xii of John Updike" />

In 1949, when the ''[[New Statesman]]'' held a contest for parodies of Greene's writing style, he submitted an entry under the name "N. Wilkinson" and won second prize. His entry comprised the first two paragraphs of a novel, apparently set in Italy, ''The Stranger's Hand: An Entertainment''. Greene's friend [[Mario Soldati]], a [[Piedmont]]ese novelist and film director, believed it had the makings of a suspense film about [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] spies in postwar [[Venice]]. Upon Soldati's prompting, Greene continued writing the story as the basis for a film script. Apparently he lost interest in the project, leaving it as a substantial fragment that was published posthumously in ''The Graham Greene Film Reader'' (1993) and ''No Man's Land'' (2005). A script for ''[[The Stranger's Hand]]'' was written by Guy Elmes on the basis of Greene's unfinished story, and filmed by Soldati in 1954. In 1965, Greene again entered a similar ''New Statesman'' competition pseudonymously, and won an honourable mention.

Greene collected several literary awards for his novels, including the 1941 [[Hawthornden Prize]] for ''[[The Power and the Glory]]'' and the 1948 [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for ''[[The Heart of the Matter]]''.  As an author, he received the 1968 [[Shakespeare Prize]] and the 1981 [[Jerusalem Prize]], a biennial literary award given to writers whose works have dealt with themes of human freedom in society.  In 1986, he was awarded Britain's [[Order of Merit]].

The Graham Greene International Festival is an annual four-day event of conference papers, informal talks, question and answer sessions, films, dramatised readings, music, creative writing workshops and social events. It is organised by the Graham Greene Birthplace Trust, and takes place in the writer's home town of Berkhamsted (about 35 miles northwest of London), on dates as close as possible to the anniversary of his birth (2 October).
