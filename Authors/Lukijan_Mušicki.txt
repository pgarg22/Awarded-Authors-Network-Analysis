'''Lukijan Mušicki''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Лукијан Мушицки}}, {{IPA-sh|lukǐjaːn muʃǐtskiː|pron}}; 27 January 1777 – 15 March 1837) was a Serbian poet, prose writer, polyglot, and [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]] bishop.

==Life and works==
He was born as '''Luka Mušicki''' in [[Temerin]] on 27 January 1777. His early education was most carefully conducted by his parents, first he was sent to a Serbian grammar school in Temerin; a German school in [[Titel]]; [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasia]] (high schools) in [[Novi Sad]] and [[Szeged]]; and finally took up studying philosophy and law at the University of [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]], though aesthetics and poetry were always his favourite subjects. [[Edmund Burke]], Johann Ludwig Schedius (1787–1847), Győrgy Alajos Szerdahelyi (1740–1808), and German poets [[Karl Wilhelm Ramler]] and [[Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock]] made a big impact on him. He was also learning Greek and English at the time.

On leaving school with little means of support, he devoted himself to letters, and in 1800 published a collection of poems in Serbian magazines and journals. With [[Georgije Magarašević]] and [[Pavel Jozef Šafárik]] he published the ''Serpski Letopis''.<ref>History of the literary cultures of East-Central Europe Marcel Cornis-Pope, John Neubauer - 2004 Volume 3 - Page 41 9027234558 "In addition to books, it published the journal Serbski Letopis, founded two years earlier by Georgije Magarašević, Pavel Jozef Šafárik, and Lukijan Mušicki in Novi Sad, where Magarašević was professor and Šafárik the director of the Serbian gymnasium."</ref> The poems encountered some adverse criticism from the Serbian ecclesiastical hierarchy, but secured for their poet the approbation and friendship of [[Vuk Karadžić]]. Henceforward Mušicki's life was steadily devoted to literary production and criticism.

Shortly afterwards he became one of the secretaries of Metropolitan [[Stefan Stratimirović]] at [[Sremski Karlovci]] where he was subjected to a rigorous ecclesiastic supervision. His superiors were suspicious of his translating ancient Latin-speaking poets, like [[Horace]], [[Lucian]], [[Virgil]] and [[Ovid]], whenever he had free time, but even more so when they found out that he knew Horace's ''De arte poetica'' by heart. Here his intentions of entering upon an academic career was for a time thwarted by his collision with his superiors. In 1802, after he had taken monastic vows and a new name ("Lukijan"), he was permitted to establish himself as ''privatdozent'', lecturing at the [[Theological Seminary in Karlovci]]. Mušicki wrote extensively on aesthetic subjects, and poetry, and as a critic he had considerable influence, but only outside of the monastic community. It was not until 1812, however, that he attained the rank of [[archimandrite]] at the [[Šišatovac Monastery]].

In 1828, at the age of 51, he was finally elevated from archimandrite to bishop of the Diocese of Upper Karlovci where he spent the remainder of his life. He died in [[Sremski Karlovci]] on 15 March 1837, at the age of sixty. Mušicki is principally remembered for his classical poetry and the many translations from the Latin of Horace. Most of his prose, in substance if not in manner, is that of a literary journalist. His lyrics, however, rank high in the context of Serbian 18th-century literature, in pseudo-classicism. As a poet he was imitative: reminiscences of Dositej and Vezilić are noticeable in his patriotic songs; of [[Goldoni]] in his lyrical poems. He wrote hastily to satisfy artistic canons; but despite his faults he also had the merits of a pioneer, and in Serbia, Bosnia, Montenegro and other parts where Serbs live his name will endure. His collected poems and writings first appeared under the title ''Lukijana Mušickog stihodvorenia'' (The Works of Lukijan Mušicki) posthumously in Budapest in 1838 and 1840 (in two volumes), and the other two volumes were released in Novi Sad in 1844 and 1847.

Born in [[Temerin]], he became a monk, and later abbot of a monastery in [[Fruška Gora]], whose religious poetry in [[Church Slavonic]], a language distant from the spoken koine, but the only literary language of his time, was recognised and valued by the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]]. His secular poetry in [[vernacular]] tongue was frowned upon, to the point that he was threatened with [[defrock]]ing, unless he repented, which in the end he did and stopped writing in what will only be justified as a written language by [[Vuk Karadžić]].

In the opinion of his contemporaries, Mušicki revived the glories of the 18th century period of pseudo-classicism, and scholars such as [[Pavel Jozef Šafárik]] called Mušicki "Prince of Serbian Poetry", [[Petar I Petrović-Njegoš]] referred to him as "a genius of our race," while [[Đura Daničić]] said Mušicki was "the father of contemporary Serbian literature;" this is friendly hyperbole. [[Jernej Kopitar]] hailed him  as "the Serbian [[Horace]]". While such judgements are naturally somewhat exaggerated, there is no doubt that Mušicki takes a very high place among Serbian poets of his day.

Indeed, Lukijan Mušicki ranks, like some of his contemporaries, [[Jovan Muškatirović]], [[Aleksije Vezilić]], [[Emanuil Janković]], [[Vićentije Rakić]], [[Pavle Solarić]], [[Atanasije Stojković]] among the authors who have both a historical and an intrinsic importance in Serbian literature and science (Janković and Stojković in particular). They represented for the 18th century the literature of their time, and kept alive, the torch handed on to them by their ''maister'' [[Dositej Obradović]].
