'''Klaus Heinrich Thomas Mann''' (18 November 1906 – 21 May 1949) was a German writer and dissident. He was the son of [[Thomas Mann]], a nephew of [[Heinrich Mann]] and brother of [[Erika Mann]], with whom he maintained a lifelong close relationship, and [[Golo Mann]]. He is well known for his 1936 novel, [[Mephisto (novel)|''Mephisto'']].

== Background ==
Born in [[Munich]], Klaus Mann was the son of German writer Thomas Mann and his wife, [[Katia Mann|Katia Pringsheim]]. His father was baptized as a Lutheran, while his mother was from a family of secular Jews.

==Career==
Mann began writing [[short story|short stories]] in 1924 and the following year became drama critic for a Berlin newspaper. His first literary works were published in 1925.

Mann's early life was troubled. His [[homosexuality]] often made him the target of [[bigotry]], and he had a difficult relationship with his father. After only a short time in various schools,<ref>Nicole Schaenzler: ''Klaus Mann. Eine Biographie''. Campus Verlag, Frankfurt – New York 1999, {{ISBN|3-593-36068-3}}, p.&nbsp;30</ref> he traveled with his sister [[Erika Mann]], a year older than himself, around the world, visiting the U.S. in 1927; they reported on the trip in essays published as a collaborative [[Travel literature|travelogue]] entitled ''Rundherum'' in 1929.<ref>Erika und Klaus Mann: Rundherum - Ahenteuer einer Weltreise. Reinbek bei Hamburg: Rowohlt, 1982.</ref>

In 1924 he had become engaged to his childhood friend Pamela Wedekind, the eldest daughter of the playwright [[Frank Wedekind]], who was also a close friend of his sister Erika.  The engagement was broken off in January 1928.

He traveled with Erika to North Africa in 1929. Around this time they made the acquaintance of [[Annemarie Schwarzenbach]], a Swiss writer and photographer, who remained close to them for the next few years. Klaus made several trips abroad with Annemarie, the final one to a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] writers' congress in Moscow in 1934.<ref>Nicole Schaenzler: ''Klaus Mann'', p.&nbsp;302</ref>

Since young adulthood, Klaus was using drugs, mostly [[opiate]]s, to which he later became heavily addicted. His diaries document an attempted [[morphine]]-injection in 1933 when Hitler took power. Initially, the aspiring writer used [[opium]], [[Eukodal]] and later [[heroin]] to possibly increase his creative energy, as this was often the case for artists and intellectuals in literary circles at the time. He underwent [[drug detoxification]] in [[Budapest]] during his frantic travels and at the [[Kilchberg, Zürich|Kilchberg]] Sanatorium in [[Switzerland]]. After 1936, his drug use and sexual escapades became excessive during his stay in New York.<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13495699.html Zauberers Sohn, Kind dieser Zeit] (in German). Spiegel Online. Retrieved 6 March 2019.</ref>

In 1932 Klaus wrote the first part of his autobiography, which was well received until Hitler came to power.<ref>Nicole Schaenzler: ''Klaus Mann'', p.&nbsp;211</ref>

In 1933 Klaus participated with Erika in a political cabaret, called ''Die Pfeffermühle'' (''The Pepper-Mill''), which came to the attention of the Nazi regime.  To escape prosecution he left Germany in March 1933 for Paris, later visiting Amsterdam and Switzerland, where his family had a house.  Also in 1933, Klaus Mann and Annemarie Schwarzenbach, together with [[Fritz Landshoff]] and Dutch publisher [[Emanuel Querido]], founded ''[[Die Sammlung]]'', a [[literary magazine]], first published in September 1933 in Amsterdam. It was primarily affiliated with a number of influential German writers who fled from the [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] regime during the first years of the establishment and consolidation of [[Nazi Germany|Nazi rule]]. The magazine was funded by the wealthy Annemarie Schwarzenbach, and Klaus Mann served as its editor-in-chief from 1933 to 1935, when ''Die Sammlung'''s activity ceased.

Klaus Mann not only played an important role in the consolidation of the German ''[[Exilliteratur]]'' but also communicated with authors who remained in Germany after 1933. In a letter exchange with [[Gottfried Benn]], whose ambivalence towards Nazi rule was well known, Klaus expressed concern about his continued membership in the national German academy of writers, pointing out the moral dilemma it posed, even urging him to leave the country to join the German intellectuals in exile.<ref>[https://kuenste-im-exil.de/KIE/Content/DE/Objekte/mann-klaus-briefwechsel-mit-gottfried-benn.html?single=1 Klaus Mann, Brief an Gottfried Benn, 9. Mai 1933] (in German). Deutsches Literatur Archiv Marbach (with permission of Frido Mann). Retrieved 12 March 2019.</ref>

In November 1934 Klaus was stripped of German citizenship by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]]. He became a [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] citizen. In 1936, he moved to the United States, living in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], and New York. In the summer of 1937, he met his partner for the rest of the year [[Thomas Quinn Curtiss]], who was later a longtime film and theater reviewer for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' and the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''. In 1940 Klaus Mann founded another literary magazine for German writers living in [[exile]] in the United States, ''Decision''. It lasted for only a year. During that time, he also lived at his [[Thomas Mann House|father's house]] in [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles|Pacific Palisades]] when he was unable to support himself financially.

Mann became a U.S. citizen in 1943. The process of naturalization was delayed because of an investigation the [[FBI]] conducted into Klaus Mann's political and sexual activities; he was openly gay but not an adherent of [[marxist]] ideologies.<ref>[https://www.1000dokumente.de/index.html?c=dokument_de&dokument=0092_kla&object=context&l=de Klaus Mann, Notizen in Moskau, 1934.] (in German). 100(0) Schlüssel Dokumente zur Deutschen Geschichte im 20. Jahrhundert. Retrieved 12 March 2019.</ref> Throughout his life in the U.S., he identified himself as a liberal [[antifascist]] and cosmopolitan. In [[World War II]], he served as a [[Staff Sergeant]] of the [[Fifth United States Army|5th U.S. Army]] in Italy. In summer 1945, he was sent by the ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'' to report from Postwar-Germany.

Mann's most famous novel, ''[[Mephisto (novel)|Mephisto]]'', was written in 1936 and first published in Amsterdam. The novel is a thinly-disguised portrait of his former brother-in-law, the actor [[Gustaf Gründgens]]. The literary scandal surrounding it made Mann posthumously famous in West Germany, as Gründgens' adopted son brought a legal case to have the novel banned after its first publication in West Germany in the early 1960s. After seven years of legal hearings, the West German Supreme Court banned it by a vote of three to three, although it continued to be available in East Germany and abroad. The ban was lifted and the novel published in West Germany in 1981.

Mann's novel ''Der Vulkan'' is one of the 20th century's most famous novels about German [[exile]]s during World War II.

==Death==
Mann died in [[Cannes]] of an [[drug overdose|overdose]] of [[barbiturate|sleeping pill]]s on 21 May 1949,<ref>{{cite news |date=May 25, 1949 |title=Report Klaus Mann Died After Overdose of Pills |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1949/05/25/page/12/article/report-klaus-mann-died-after-overdose-of-pills |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |page=12 }}</ref> after another drug treatment. The prolific writer likely committed suicide because of financial problems and social isolation. He was buried there in the [[Cimetière du Grand Jas]].
