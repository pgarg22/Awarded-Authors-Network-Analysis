'''Osbern Bokenam''' (c. 1393 – c. 1464, also spelt '''Bokenham''') was an English [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] (Austin) friar and poet. He was a follower of [[Geoffrey Chaucer]].

==Life==
Osbern Bokenam was born, according to his own account, on 6 October 1393. His name suggests he may have been a native of Bokeham, now Bookham, in [[Surrey]], or of Buckenham in [[Norfolk]]. In a concluding note to his ''Lives of the Saints'', Bokenam is described as a "Suffolke man, frere Austyn of [[Stoke-by-Clare|Stoke Clare]]" (friar at [[Clare Priory]] in Suffolk).<ref name=macpherson>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02625c.htm Macpherson, Ewan. "Osbern Bokenham." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. Retrieved 28 March 2013].</ref>

Bokenam travelled in [[Italy]] on at least two occasions, possibly living for a time in Venice and Rome. In 1445 he was a [[pilgrim]] to [[Santiago de Compostela]] in Spain.<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911 |inline=1 |wstitle=Bokenam, Osbern |volume=4 |page=156}}</ref>

==Writings==
Bokenam wrote a series of 13 legends of holy maidens and women, chiefly in seven and eight-lined [[stanza]]s. Nine of these have [[prologue]]s. Bokenam was a follower of [[Chaucer]] and [[John Lydgate|Lydgate]], and doubtless had in mind Chaucer's ''Legend of Good Women''. His chief, but by no means only source was the ''Legenda Aurea'' of [[Jacobus de Voragine]], [[Archbishop of Genoa]], whom he cites as "Januence". The first of the legends, ''Vita S[an]c[t]ae Margaretae, virginis et martyris'' (Life of St Margaret, Virgin and Martyr), was written for a friend, Thomas Burgh, a [[Cambridge]] monk. Others are dedicated to pious ladies who desired the history of the patron saints after whom they had been named.<ref name="EB1911"/>

The ''Arundel MS. 327'' (in the [[British Museum]]) is a unique copy of Bokenam's work. It was finished, according to the concluding note, in 1447, and presented by the scribe, Thomas Burgh, to an unnamed [[convent]] "that the nuns may remember him and his sister, Dame Betrice Burgh."<ref name="EB1911"/>

The poems were edited in 1835 for the [[Roxburghe Club]] with the title ''Lyvys of Seyntys...'', and by Dr Carl Horstmann as ''Osbern Bokenams Legenden'' (Heilbronn, 1883), in [[Eugen Kölbing]]'s ''Altengl. Bibliothek'', vol. i. Both editions include a dialogue written in Latin and English, taken from [[William Dugdale]]'s ''Monasticon Anglicanum'' (ed. 1846, vol. vi, p. 1600), between a "Secular asking and a Frere answerynge at the grave of Dame Johan of Acres [who] shewith the lyneal descent of the lordis of the honore of Clare fro... MCCXLVIII to... MCCCLVI". Bokenam wrote, as he tells us plainly, in the [[Suffolk]] speech. He explains his lack of decoration on the plea that the finest flowers had been already plucked by Chaucer, [[John Gower|Gower]] and Lydgate.<ref name="EB1911"/>

In 2004 a manuscript copy of Bokenam's version of ''Legenda Aurea'' was found in the library of [[Abbotsford House]], Scotland. It had been bought in 1809 by [[Sir Walter Scott]] and then forgotten.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.augnet.org/default.asp?ipageid=731 |title=Archived copy |access-date=28 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090915085742/http://augnet.org/default.asp?ipageid=731 |archive-date=15 September 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref>
