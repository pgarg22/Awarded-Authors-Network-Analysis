'''Rolf Jacobsen''' (8 March 1907 – 20 February 1994){{cn|date=November 2020}} was a Norwegian author.

Jacobsen could be said to be the first [[modernism|modernist]] writer in [[Norway]].  Jacobsen's career as a writer spanned more than fifty years. He is one of [[Scandinavia]]’s most distinguished poets, who launched poetic modernism in Norway with his first book, ''Jord og jern'' in 1933. Jacobsen's work has been translated into over twenty languages. The central theme in his work is the balance between nature and technology – he was called "the Green Poet" in Norwegian literature.<ref>[http://www.nrk.no/programmer/stemmer_fra_arkivet/stemmer_fra_litteraturen/2336741.html ''Rolf Jacobsen'' (NRK)]</ref>

== Youth ==
Rolf Jacobsen was born in [[Oslo]] (then called Kristiania), as the son of Martin Julius Jacobsen (1865–1944), who had completed both medical and dental school, and Marie (Nielsen) Jacobsen (1880–1953)a nurse. At the age of six he moved with his family to [[Åsnes]], where Martin Jacobsen had obtained a post as a school [[dentist]]. Rolf was educated by his mother, who had completed one year of teacher's training. In 1920 he moved to Oslo and entered a private school. During these years his uncle, who was a railway engineer, looked after him. Jacobson continued his studies at the [[University of Oslo]] for five years without graduating. In 1927 he served in the Norwegian army for six weeks.<ref>[http://www.hedmarkslitteraturer.no/forfatterside_jacobsen.htm ''Rolf Jacobsen ''(Hedmarkslitteraturer)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724175821/http://www.hedmarkslitteraturer.no/forfatterside_jacobsen.htm |date=2011-07-24 }}</ref>

From 1937 to 1939 he was a board member of Hedmark [[Norwegian Labour Party|Labour Party]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Solbakken|first=Evald O.|author-link=Evald O. Solbakken|title=Det røde fylke.

== Early career ==
Jacobsen's ''Jord og jern'', written in [[free verse]], introduced the urban world, racing cars, airplanes, and electrical turbines. Because of the choice of his subjects Jacobsen's work was connected to Marinetti and [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]], but his view was all but romantic. He did not share the Futurists' euphoria over modern inventions, the beauty of "a roaring motorcar, which runs like a machine-gun," but saw the relationship between machines and human civilization as more complex. Jacobsen's diverse literary and other artistic influences included the [[Poetic Edda]], [[Karel Čapek]]'s play ''[[R.U.R.]]'', and [[Carl Sandburg]]'s poetry. The title of the collection also suggests a cyclic relationship between nature and technology.<ref>[http://www.dagbladet.no/jacobsen/index.html ''Rolf Jacobsen'' (Dagbladet)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011051537/http://www.dagbladet.no/jacobsen/index.html |date=2012-10-11 }}</ref>

In 1934 Jacobsen returned to Åsnes to take care of his father. He had joined a [[socialist]] intellectual group, [[Clarté (Norway)|Clarté]], and in Åsnes he became a member of the [[Norwegian Labour Party|Labor Party]] Leadership for [[Hedmark]] County. In Åsnes, Jacobsen worked for the daily newspaper ''[[Kongsvinger Arbeiderblad]]'', which was supported by Labor. Jacobsen's second collection of poems, ''Vrimmel'' (1935), revealed his underlying dismay at modern civilization. Jacobsen rejected [[Marinetti]]'s [[Futurist Manifesto|manifesto]], "We wish to glory war...", but predicted the ominous emergence of the gas masks and machine guns. After ''Vrimmel'', Jacobsen was silent as a poet for 16 years.

== German Occupation years==

During the [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany]], (1940-1945)  Jacobsen signed and published  in ''Kongsvinger Arbeiderblad''  [[editorial]]s that supported the German occupiers. He was also a member of the [[Nasjonal Samling|Norwegian National Socialist Party]]. After the liberation of Norway at the end of [[World War II]], Jacobsen was convicted of treason and sentenced to three and a half years at hard labor.

After his internment, Jacobsen settled at [[Abelsethgården]] in the city of [[Hamar]]. He worked as a bookseller for ten years, and then as a journalist and night editor for the newspaper ''Hamar Stifstidende''. In 1950 he converted to [[Roman Catholicism]], and in 1951, Jacobsen published his third collection of poems, ''Fjerntog''. The poems were traditional in form. In this work and in ''Hemmelig liv'' (1954), Jacobsen expressed his troubled compassion for the world around him. A new theme was the rough and lonely Norwegian scenery.<ref>[http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Rolf_Jacobsen/utdypning ''Rolf Jacobsen'' (Store norske leksikon)]</ref>

Jacobsen often expressed ironically his doubts about [[technology]], and praised the blessings of little joys. Sometimes he used humor, sometimes his poems had hymnlike solemnity. In Hamar, Jacobsen lived in an old wooden house near [[Lake Mjøsa]] and the railroad. These surroundings he also described in his poems. Jacobsen's later books include ''Pass for dørene - dørene lukkes'' (1972), ''Pusteøvelse'' (1975), and ''Tenk på noe annet'' (1979).

==Personal life==
In 1940 Jacobsen married Petra Tendø (1912–1983),  they had two sons. While his parents' marriage did not succeed, Jacobsen's own marriage was harmonious. After his wife's death, in his last book, ''Nattåpent'' (1985), Jacobsen published tender and mournful poems about their life together: "Whoever loves for years / hasn't lived in vain."
He died during 1994 and was buried at Hamar kirkegård in [[Hamar]].{{cn|date=November 2020}}
