'''Jack Gilbert''' (February 18, 1925 – November 13, 2012) was an American poet. Gilbert was acquainted with [[Jack Spicer]] and [[Allen Ginsberg]], both prominent figureheads of the [[Beat Generation|Beat Movement]], but is not considered a Beat Poet; he described himself as a "serious romantic."<ref name="Penner 2012"/><ref name="PF" /> Over his five-decade-long career, he published five full collections of poetry.<ref name="Haglund 2012" /><ref name="PF" />

==Early life and education==
Born and raised in the [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]] neighborhood of [[East Liberty (Pittsburgh)|East Liberty]],<ref Name="Poets.org">[http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/1275 Profile at Poets.org]</ref> he attended [[Peabody High School (Pennsylvania)|Peabody High School]]. Gilbert then worked as a door-to-door salesman, an exterminator, and a steelworker. 

He was admitted to the [[University of Pittsburgh]] and graduated in 1954. During these college years he and his classmate [[Gerald Stern]] developed a serious interest in poetry and writing. 

Gilbert received his master's degree from [[San Francisco State University]] in 1963.<ref name="Penner 2012">{{cite news|last=Penner|first=John|title=Jack Gilbert dies at 87; unconventional poet knew fame and obscurity|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-jack-gilbert-20121114,0,332360.story|accessdate=14 November 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=14 November 2012}}</ref>

==Career==
After college, Gilbert went to Paris and worked briefly at the [[Paris Herald Tribune|''Herald Tribune'']] before moving to Italy. Gilbert spent several years there before moving to San Francisco and then to New York, where his life as a poet began.

His work has been distinguished by simple lyricism and straightforward clarity of tone, as well as a resonating control over his emotions: “We look up at the stars and they are / not there. We see memory / of when they were, once upon a time. / And that too is more than enough.” His first book of poetry, ''Views of Jeopardy'', (1962) won the [[Yale Younger Poets Prize]] and was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize,<ref name="Penner 2012"/> and Gilbert was quickly recognized.<ref name="Haglund 2012">{{cite news|last=Haglund|first=David|title=Jack Gilbert, American Poet, Dies at 87|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2012/11/13/jack_gilbert_dead_poet_was_87.html|accessdate=14 November 2012|newspaper=Slate|date=13 November 2012}}</ref>

He then retreated from his earlier activity in the San Francisco poetry scene, where he had participated in [[Jack Spicer]]'s ''Poetry as Magic'' workshop,<ref Name="Poets.org"/> and moved to Europe. Living on a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]]<ref name="PF"/> he toured 15 countries as a lecturer on [[American Literature]] for the [[U.S. State Department]] and lived in England, Denmark, and Greece.<ref name="Poets.org"/>

His books of poetry were few and far between; however he continuously maintained his writing and contributed to ''The [[American Poetry Review]]'', ''[[Genesis West]]'', ''[[The Quarterly]]'', ''[[Poetry magazine|Poetry]]'', ''Ironwood'', ''[[Kenyon Review|The Kenyon Review]]'', and ''[[The New Yorker]]''. Gilbert was the 1999-2000 Grace Hazard Conkling writer-in-residence at [[Smith College]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/jack-gilbert |title=Jack Gilbert |publisher=The Academy of American Poets |accessdate=2017-02-04}}</ref>

Gilbert was also a visiting professor and [[writer-in-residence]] at the [[University of Tennessee]] in 2004. Author [[Elizabeth Gilbert]], who discovered Jack Gilbert when she succeeded him in the same writing chair, declared, "He became the poet laureate of my life."<ref>{{cite news |last=Fassler|first=Joe|date= 2012-11-06|title=The 'Stubborn Gladness' of Elizabeth Gilbert's Favorite Poet|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/11/the-stubborn-gladness-of-elizabeth-gilberts-favorite-poet/281158/|newspaper=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-02-04}}</ref>

On April 15, 2013 it was announced that Gilbert's ''Collected Poems'' was a finalist for the 2013 [[Pulitzer Prize in Poetry]]. The Pulitzer jury's citation read: {{cquote|''a half century of poems reflecting a creative author’s commitment to living fully and honestly and to producing straightforward work that illuminates everyday experience with startling clarity.''<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.pulitzer.org/citation/2013-Poetry The Pulitzer Prizes | Citation<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>}}

==Personal life==
Much of Gilbert's work is about his relationships with women. While in Italy, he met Gianna Gelmetti, a romantic partner who appears frequently in his work. The relationship ended after a year. Gilbert was a close friend of the poet [[Linda Gregg]], whom he met when she was nineteen and his student in San Francisco, and with whom he was in a relationship for six years. Of the poet, Gregg once said, "All Jack ever wanted to know was that he was awake—that the trees in bloom were almond trees—and to walk down the road to get breakfast. He never cared if he was poor or had to sleep on a park bench."<ref Name="PF"/><ref>[http://www.slate.com/id/2118238/ ''Slate article'']</ref>

He was also in a significant long-term relationship with the poet [[Laura Ulewicz]] during the late fifties and early sixties in San Francisco. Ulewicz was a great influence on his early work; in fact much of his characteristic style for which he later became known came directly from her, and his first book was dedicated to her.<ref>Gilbert, Jack (1962). "Views of Jeopardy", viii.</ref> Gilbert also was in a relationship with Michiko Nogami,<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/14/books/collected-poems-by-jack-gilbert.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Dwight | last=Garner | title='Collected Poems' by Jack Gilbert | date=March 13, 2012}}</ref> another former student and a Japanese language instructor 21 years his junior, about whom he wrote many of his poems. Nogami died of cancer at the age of 36, in 1982.<ref Name="PF"/> Gilbert died on November 13, 2012 in [[Berkeley, California]].<ref Name="Penner 2012"/> He was 87.
