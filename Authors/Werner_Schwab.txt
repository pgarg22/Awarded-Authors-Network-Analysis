{{short description|Austrian playwright}}
'''Werner Schwab''' (4 February 1958 &ndash; 1 January 1994) was an [[Austria]]n [[playwright]] and visual artist.

==Biography==
From 1978 to 1982 he studied sculpture at the [[Akademie der bildenden Künste]] in [[Vienna]]. During the 1980s he worked as a sculptor and woodcutter.

Schwab was a heavy drinker who was said to have written his plays late at night while listening to loud music (particularly the band [[Einstürzende Neubauten]], whom he was friends with). His body was found on New Year's Day 1994.

==Work==
Schwab's first play ''Die Präsidentinnen'' (sometimes translates as ''First Ladies''<ref>[http://www.dublintheatre.ie/index.php/2011/05/first-ladies-by-werner-schwab-at-the-matchbox-theatre/ ''FIRST LADIES by Werner Schwab at the Matchbox Theatre'']</ref> or ''Holy mothers''), was produced at the [[Vienna Künstlerhaus|Theater im Künstlerhaus]] in Vienna in 1990. Between then and his death four years later he wrote sixteen plays, eight of which were produced during his lifetime, making his career one of the briefest, most spectacular and most controversial in contemporary German-language [[theatre]].

Schwab's work is close to the [[grotesque]] genre. It extensively employed [[scatology]] and [[sex]], with the peculiarity of exhibiting pulsions and taboos in a poetic framework.<ref name="Jolly">Jolly, Geneviève [http://www.voixduregard.org/15-Jolly.pdf ''L'obscénité et la scène : le théâtre de Werner Schwab'']</ref> He renewed the tradition of [[German Expressionism]].<ref name="Jolly"/> His plays are full of images of surreal violence and degradation, and are firmly grounded within a native Austrian tradition of [[Black comedy]]. Schwab conceived theater as anti-bourgeois.<ref>Gisela Holfter, Marieke Krajenbrink, Edward Moxon-Browne [https://books.google.com/books?id=aasyO27IGsQC ''Beziehungen und Identitäten: Österreich, Irland und die Schweiz''] p.232</ref>

He made use of textual [[collage]]s and [[intertextuality]].<ref>Wagner, Meike (2008) [https://books.google.com/books?id=MF54YmLCn80C ''Performing the Matrix. Mediating Cultural Performances''] p.91</ref> His 1995 play ''Troilluswahn und Cressidatheater'' is a [[Reprise|rewriting]] of Shakespeare's ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'' into the [[grotesque]] genre.<ref>A. J. Hoenselaars (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=PgJAUnusS84C&pg=PA157 ''Shakespeare and the language of translation''] p.157</ref>

Another characteristic of his texts is to exploit the [[German language]]'s capacity for [[neologism]] to a remarkable degree. He is very difficult to translate, but amongst English-language dramatists, certain stylistic parallels might be drawn between his work and that of [[Steven Berkoff]] and [[Enda Walsh]]. [[Vera San Payo de Lemos]] won the Austrian Prize for Literary Translation in 1998 and 2002 for her work in translating his work.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2010-10-16|title=VERA SAN PAYO DE LEMOS|url=https://artistasunidos.pt/vera-san-payo-de-lemos/|access-date=2020-12-31|website=Artistas Unidos|language=pt-PT}}</ref>
