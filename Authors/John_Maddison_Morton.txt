Morton lived in [[Chertsey]] for many years.<ref>[http://www.jrank.org/literature/pages/12368/Chertsey-Surrey.html Chertsey, Surrey], ''Literature Reference'', accessed 17 January 2011</ref><ref>[http://www.newspaperdetectives.co.uk/master1865M.htm 1865], {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509154340/http://www.newspaperdetectives.co.uk/master1865M.htm |date= 9 May 2008 }} ''Newspaper Detectives'', accessed 17 January 2011</ref> It was there that he wrote ''[[Box and Cox (farce)|Box and Cox]]'' (1847), which ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1891 called "the best farce of the nineteenth century".<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C04E2D7133AE533A25751C2A9649D94609ED7CF "Obituary: The Author of 'Box and Cox'"], ''The New York Times'', 22 December 1891</ref>{{#tag:ref|''Box and Cox'' was in the tradition of E. F. Prieur and A. Letorzec's ''Une Chambre pour Deux'' (1839), and ''The Double-Bedded Room'' (1843), a skit about two men who occupy the same room without being aware of each other's existence, having been tricked by their landlady Mrs Bouncer. The latter play was returned to the French stage by [[Charles Varin]] and Charles Lefèvre as ''Une Chambre à Deux Lits'' (1846). How much Morton's play owed to its predecessors is not clear. Morton is not known to have pronounced on the matter, but [[F. C. Burnand]], who later adapted ''Box and Cox'' as an [[Cox and Box|operetta]] discounted the importance of ''La Chambre à Deux Lits''.  He wrote, "Whether ''La Chambre'' was 'taken from the Spanish', who, I dare say, have got on very well without it, or not, certainly it was not the original source of ''Box and Cox''. This immortal English farce was adapted – a masterpiece of adaptation, be it said – from a ''comédie-vaudeville'' by Labiche and Lefranc entitled ''Frisette''."  Burnand added that the later sections of the plot of ''Box and Cox'', namely the men's connubial entanglements, their efforts to evade them, and the discovery that they are brothers, were not derived from anyone, and were "thoroughly Mortonian".<ref>Burnand, F. C., letter to ''The Times'', 18 October 1889, p. 8</ref>|group= n}} ''Box and Cox'', was wildly successful, earning him about £7000, and was translated into many European languages. A musical version, ''[[Cox and Box]]'' (1867), was created by [[F. C. Burnand]] and [[Arthur Sullivan]], but Morton received no royalties from it. However, it brought him a measure of fame as it is often revived by Gilbert and Sullivan fans, helping to make it his best known work.

Sullivan's later collaborator [[W.S. Gilbert]], made reference to the well-known Morton in his story, "My First Brief".
 
Morton wrote several comic dramas in two acts, including ''Old Honesty'' (1848), ''All That Glitters Is Not Gold'' (1851), ''From Village to Court'' (1854), ''The Muleteer of Toledo, or King, Queen and Knave'' (1855), ''Our Wife, or The Rose of Amiens'' (1856), ''A Husband to Order'' (1859), ''She Would and He Wouldn't'' (1862), ''Woodcock's Little Game'' (1864) and ''Little Mother'' (1870). ''Our Wife'' was made into an 1883 [[operetta]] by [[John Philip Sousa]] called ''[[Désirée (operetta)|Désirée]]''.

Many of Morton's pieces enjoyed great success and contributed to building up the reputations of leading comic actors such as [[John Buckstone]] (who was Box in the first representation of ''Box and Cox''), [[Henry Compton (actor)|Henry Compton]] and the [[Mary Anne Keeley|Keeleys]]. In 1873 [[Marion Terry]] made her first West End appearances in his plays, ''A Game of Romps'' and ''All That Glitters Is Not Gold'' at the [[Olympic Theatre]].

In Morton's last decades, the popularity of [[Victorian burlesque]] greatly diminished the market for farces. He fell on hard times and in 1881 became a [[London Charterhouse|Charterhouse pensioner]]. His last new play to be produced in his lifetime, at [[Toole's Theatre]] in 1885, was a three-act farcical comedy called ''Going It'', which kept the house in a continual roar of laughter. It was said of Morton that "The unlucky thing about him was that though he could write as well at 80 as at 30, he was left stranded high and dry by the receding wave of fashion."<ref>[http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=OW18920317.2.118&I=mi&c=-------10--1----0-all "Theatrical and Musical Notes"], ''Otago Witness'', 17 Poutūterangi (March) 1892, p. 36.</ref> He died at the Charterhouse on 19 December 1891 and was buried on the 23rd at [[Kensal Green Cemetery]].

==Modern revivals==
Despite his prolific play writing career, Morton has not been performed regularly since his death, with the exception of 'Cox and Box'. In 1967 [[Kenneth Tynan]] wrote that a "re-discovery is long overdue".<ref>Tynan, p. 408</ref> In 1967 the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] performed Morton's ''A Most Unwarrantable Intrusion'' as part of a triple bill including a play by [[John Lennon]].<ref>[http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/7127/archive-collection/prompt-scripts-bibles.html Archive Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229180448/http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/7127/archive-collection/prompt-scripts-bibles.html |date=29 December 2010 }}, National Theatre, accessed 17 January 2011</ref>

As a bicentenary celebration of Morton's birth, in June 2011 the [[Orange Tree Theatre]], presented a triple bill of three of Morton's one act farces, ''Slasher and Crasher!'', ''A Most Unwarrantable Intrusion'' and ''Grimshaw, Bagshaw and Bradshaw'', directed by [[Henry Bell (theatre director and academic)|Henry Bell]].<ref>[http://www.britishtheatreguide.info/reviews/3farces-rev.htm 3 Farces] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115090456/http://britishtheatreguide.info/reviews/3farces-rev.htm |date=15 November 2011 }}. British Theatre Guide, accessed 16 June 2011</ref>  ''[[The Guardian]]'''s  reviewer  [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]] commented that the production "proves the prolific Morton is unjustly neglected", praising Bell's productions.<ref>Billington, Michael.
