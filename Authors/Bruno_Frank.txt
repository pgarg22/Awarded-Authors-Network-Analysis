'''Bruno Frank''' (June 13, 1887 – June 20, 1945) was a German author, poet, playwright, screenwriter, and [[humanism|humanist]].

==Biography==

Frank was born in [[Stuttgart]]. He studied [[law]] and [[philosophy]] in [[Munich]], where he later worked as a dramatist and novelist until the [[Reichstag fire]] in 1933. Persecuted by the government because of his [[Jewish]] heritage, he left [[Nazi Germany]] with his wife, Liesl, daughter of famed Jewish operetta [[diva]] [[Fritzi Massary]] and Count [https://www.geni.com/people/Karl-Kuno-Graf-von-Coudenhove-Honrichs/6000000020388905474 Karl Coudenhove]. They lived for four years in Austria and England, before emigrating in 1937 to the United States, where he was reunited with his friends [[Heinrich Mann]] and [[Thomas Mann]]. Frank is considered part of the group of [[anti-nazi|anti-Nazi]] writers whose works constitute German [[Exilliteratur]]. He continued to write, producing two novels, and worked in the film industry for the rest of his life.

Frank wrote the screenplay for the popular movie version of [[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939 film)|''The Hunchback of Notre Dame'' (1939 film)]], directed by [[William Dieterle]] and starring [[Charles Laughton]], based on the novel by [[Victor Hugo]]. Frank's play, ''Sturm im Wasserglas'', was filmed in Great Britain, in 1937, as [[Storm in a Teacup (film)|Storm in a Teacup]], and posthumously made into [[Storm in a Water Glass (1960 film)|a movie]] directed by [[Josef von Báky]] in 1960.

His nephew [[Anthony M. Frank]] became [[United States Postmaster General]] in 1988.

Frank died of a heart attack in [[Beverly Hills]].  He is interred in the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Glendale, California]].
