== Personal life ==
Kannadasan was born to Sathappan Chettiar and Visalakshi Aachi in the year 1927, in '''Sirukudalpatti''', near Karaikudi, Tamil Nadu, India and was given the birth name Muthiah. He was the eighth child to his parents and had ten siblings. He was adopted by Chigappi Aachi for a sum of INR 7000 at an early age, who brought him up and was responsible for his early stages of school education. He completed his schooling till the 8th standard in Sirukudalpatti and Amaravathipudhur. He worked for a private company in [[Tiruvottiyur]] before taking up an editorial post in a Tamil Magazine where for the first time he took up the pseudonym Kannadasan. He died on October 17, 1981.

===Religious views===
Muthiaah was a keen follower of the [[Dravidian movement|Dravidian atheistic movement]]. He had great love of Tamil language and its culture, and excelled in [[Tamil literature]], both prose and poetry. He read the [[Thiruppaavai]] of [[Aandaal]], and was amazed at its mystic poetry, which had a deep and lasting impact on him. After a lot of introspection, he decided to go back to [[Hinduism]]. He renamed himself as Kannadaasan, meaning the servant of Lord [[Krishna]] (In Tamil, ''Kannan'' means Krishna and in Sanskrit, ''daasa'' means ''servant'. ''He dug deep into understanding [[Hinduism]], and wrote his series of books on [[Hinduism]] titled ''Arthamulla Indhu Matham''. .''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://naattukkottaichettiar.blogspot.in/|title=Naattuikottai Chettiar chettiar|website=naattuikottaichettiar.blogspot.in|access-date=2017-08-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Nagarathaar Heritage|title=Kannadaasan Biography {{!}} Kaviarasu {{!}} Sirukoodalpatti|date=2017-04-03|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q11nirUmlwA|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=2017-08-28}}</ref>''

==Songwriting==
Kannadasan's greatest contribution to Tamil culture is his songwriting. Before Kannadasan, many lyricists like [[Papanasam Sivan]], Kambadasan, Vindhan, [[A. Maruthakasi]], and [[Ku. Ma. Balasubramaniam]] were sought after in the Tamil music industry, but after the advent of Kannadasan, the scene changed. He quickly became the most sought-after lyricist in the industry and remained so until his death. Kannadasan was so popular that some songs written by other contemporary poets were considered to be written by Kannadhasan. Though, film lyrics have come a long way since his death, many people still consider Kannadasan to be the best songwriter.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} He is considered to be the greatest modern Tamil poet after [[Subramanya Bharathi]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

He was the producer of the historic Tamil film ''[[Sivagangai Seemai]]'' portraying Marudhu Pandaiars, one of the pioneers in the Indian freedom struggle. {{citation needed|date=November 2021}} The song "Santhupottu" from that film remains popular. {{citation needed|date=November 2021}}
