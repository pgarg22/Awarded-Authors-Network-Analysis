'''Clifford Lea Bax''' (13 July 1886 – 18 November 1962)<ref>Armorial Families: A Directory of Gentlemen of Coat-Armour, A. C. Fox-Davies, T. C. & E. C. Jack, 1910, p. 106</ref><ref>Arnold Bax, Colin Scott-Sutherland, Dent, 1973, p. 4</ref> was a versatile English writer, known particularly as a playwright, a journalist, critic and editor, and a poet, lyricist and hymn writer. He also was a translator (for example, of [[Goldoni]]). The composer [[Arnold Bax]] was his brother, and set some of his words to music.

==Life==
The youngest son of Alfred Ridley Bax (1844–1918) and his wife, Charlotte Ellen (1860–1940), daughter of Rev. William Knibb Lea, of Amoy, China,<ref name=dnb>Foreman, Lewis. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/30645 "Bax, Sir Arnold Edward Trevor"], Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, retrieved 16 September 2015 {{ODNBsub}}</ref><ref>Armorial Families: A Directory of Gentlemen of Coat-Armour, A. C. Fox-Davies, T. C. & E. C. Jack, 1910, p. 106</ref>
Bax was born in [[Tooting Bec|Upper Tooting]], south London (not [[Knightsbridge]], as sometimes stated). His father was a [[barrister]] of the [[Middle Temple]], but having a private income he did not practise. In 1896 the family moved to a mansion in [[Hampstead]].<ref>* {{cite journal | last=Foreman | first=Lewis | title=The Musical Development of Arnold Bax | journal=Music & Letters | pages=59–68 | date=January 1971 | volume=52 | issue=1 | doi=10.1093/ml/LII.1.59 | jstor=731834 | url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/731834 }} {{subscription}} p. 60</ref> He was educated at the [[Slade School of Art|Slade]] and the [[Heatherley School of Fine Art|Heatherley Art School]].<ref>[http://library.mcmaster.ca/archives/findaids/fonds/b/bax.htm Clifford Bax collection, 1924-1926<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He gave up painting to concentrate on writing.
 
Independent wealth gave Bax time to write, and social connections. He had an apartment in [[Albany (London)|Albany]], the apartment complex in Piccadilly, London. He was a friend of [[Gustav Holst]], whom he introduced to [[astrology]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gustavholst.info/compositions/listing.php?work=18 |title=Gustav Holst (1874–1934) {{!}} The Planets<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=28 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928143649/http://www.gustavholst.info/compositions/listing.php?work=18 |archive-date=28 September 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> the critic [[James Agate]], and [[Arthur Ransome]], among others. He met and played chess with [[Aleister Crowley]] in 1904, and kept up an acquaintance with him over the years, later in the 1930s introducing  both the artist [[Frieda Harris]] and the writer [[John Symonds]] to him.<ref>[http://supertarot.co.uk/adept/fharris.htm Biography of Frieda Harris, artist for the Thoth Tarot<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006140914/http://supertarot.co.uk/adept/fharris.htm |date=6 October 2007 }}</ref> An early venture (1908–1914) was ''Orpheus'', a [[Theosophy (disambiguation)|theosophical]] magazine he edited. His interest in the esoteric extended to editing works of [[Jakob Boehme]], and helping [[Allan Bennett]], the Buddhist.

His first play on the commercial stage was ''The Poetasters of Ispahan'' (1912), and he became a fixture of British drama for a generation. He was involved in the ''Phoenix Society'' (1919–1926), concerned with reviving older plays, and the ''[[Incorporated Stage Society]]''.

He also edited, with [[Austin Osman Spare]], ''Golden Hind'', an artistic and literary magazine that appeared from October 1922 to July 1924.

A [[cricket]] enthusiast, he was a friend of [[C. B. Fry]]<ref>[http://www.authorsonline.co.uk/book/C.B.+Fry+-+An+English+Hero/sample/ Authors OnLine - C.B.

G. Grace]].

==Family==
He married actress and jewellery-maker Gwendolen Daphne Bishop, née Bernhard-Smith, on 28 September 1910. Their daughter, Undine, was born 6 August 1911.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

In 1927, Bax married Vera, née Rawnsley, a painter and poet (1888–1974). Rawnsley was previously married to Stanley Kennedy North, an artist, and  [[Filson Young|Alexander Bell Filson Young]] (1876–1938), a journalist with whom she had two sons: William David Loraine Filson-Young and Richard Filson-Young; they—Bax's stepsons—were both killed in [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Mazzarella | first = Sylvester | author-link = | title = Filson Young: The first media man (1876-1938); part 29- Vera | date = | url = http://richarddnorth.com/archived-sites/filsonyoung/biography/part-5-admiralty-spy-1914-19/29-vera/ | accessdate = 8 December 2020}}</ref>
