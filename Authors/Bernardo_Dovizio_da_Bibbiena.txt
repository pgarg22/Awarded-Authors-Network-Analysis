'''Bernardo Dovizi''' of '''Bibbiena''' (4 August 1470 &ndash; 9 November 1520) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] and [[comedy]] writer, known best as '''Cardinal Bibbiena''', for the town of [[Bibbiena]], where he was born.

He received a substantial literary training, and became a preceptor and boon companion of [[Giovanni di Lorenzo de' Medici|Giovanni dei Medici]], the future Pope [[Leo X]] (from 1513 to his death in 1521). In November 1494, when the [[Medici]] were banished, he supported them. Soon afterwards he was rewarded with the protection of [[Julius II]] and many honours at the Roman court.  In 1513 his arduous efforts on behalf of his lifelong patron secured the election of [[Giovanni di Lorenzo de' Medici|Giovanni dei Medici]] to the pontifical throne.

Leo X repaid such services by naming him a Cardinal in the Consistory of 23 September 1513, and appointing him Cardinal Deacon of S. Maria in Porticu.  Leo continued to show his favor by appointing Bibbiena his treasurer and entrusting him with many important missions, among them the [[Captain General of the Church|command of the Papal army]] in the [[War of Urbino]] (1517) and a legation to [[France]] (1518). Later on, the cardinal's strong sympathies for France lost him Leo's confidence. As cardinal he steadily extended his generous patronage of the arts - he was a close friend of [[Raphael]], whom he had known since his youth, and arranged his engagement to his niece. Raphael painted a number of works for him, including frescoes of a classical and erotic style for his [[Stufetta del cardinal Bibbiena|bathroom in the Vatican]].

===Author===

His literary fame is mainly connected with the first comedy of note written in Italian prose, ''[[La Calandria (A play)|La Calandra]]'' (also, known as ''Il Calandro'' and ''La Calandria''), was probably given for the first time at [[Urbino]], about 1507. It was performed elaborately at [[Rome]], seven years later, in the presence of [[Leo X]] and Isabella Gonzaga d'Este, Marchioness of [[Mantua]]. Though containing glaringly immoral scenes, using the plot of [[Plautus]]'s ''[[Menaechmi]]'', it possessed the features of modern comedy and won plaudits for its sparkling wit and fine characterization.

The main character, [[Calandrino|Calandro]] or [[Calandrino]], was borrowed from [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s [[Decameron]] in which he appears as a character in four stories. The author of the comedy sympathizes with Fulvia, and her lover Lidio, mocking the foolish husband of Calandro, who falls in love with Lidio, who changes into women's dress. The speeches of Fesenio, the servant of Calandro, shine with Italian sparkling jokes.

[[Ariosto]] and [[Machiavelli]] imitated this comedy in their plays.

A [[Padua]]n poet serving at the [[Dresden]] Court, [[Stefano Benedetto Pallavicino]], wrote a libretto based on the same story for the comic opera ''[[Calandro]]'' by [[Giovanni Alberto Ristori]]. It was first staged in 1726 at the castle of Pilnitz near Dresden, and in 1731 in [[Moscow]] it was the first ever opera performed in [[Russia]].

There were also the operas by:
*[[Antonio Sacchini]], ''L'avaro deluso, o Don Calandrino'' (24 November 1778 [[London]])
*Johann Georg Schürer, ''Calandro'' (20 January 1748 [[Dresden]])
*Giuseppe Gazzaniga, ''Il Calandrino'' (1771 [[Venice]])
