==Life==
Farmer was born a [[fraternal twin]] in [[Westerham]], Kent, on 14 June 1939, as the third child of Hugh Robert MacDonald (died 26 May 2004) and Penelope Boothby Farmer.<ref name=bookrags>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bookrags.com/biography/penelope-jane-farmer-dlb/ |title= Dictionary of Literary Biography : Penelope (Jane) Farmer |website=www.bookrags.com |access-date=28 January 2017}}</ref> Her parents and hospital staff were unaware of her existence until some 25 minutes after the birth of her twin sister Judith.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Farmer |first1=Penelope |title=Two, or The Book of Twins & Doubles |url=https://archive.org/details/twoorbookoftwins00farm |url-access=registration |date=1996 |publisher=Virago Press |location=London |page=[https://archive.org/details/twoorbookoftwins00farm/page/11 11]}}</ref> Throughout Farmer's life, twinship has been a defining element in her understanding of her identity. The twins have an older brother, Tim, and a younger sister, Sally.<ref name=suthor1999>{{Cite book |title=Something About the Author |series=Something About the Author Series |date=1999 |volume=105 |isbn=0787621269 |publisher=Gale |page=[https://archive.org/details/somethingaboutau0105unse/page/64 64] |url=https://archive.org/details/somethingaboutau0105unse/page/64 }}</ref>

After attending a [[boarding school]], she read history at [[St Anne's College, Oxford]] and did postgraduate work at [[Bedford College (London)|Bedford College, University of London]].<ref>Anita Silvey, ed: ''Children's books and their creators'' (New York, Houghton Mifflin, 1995), p. 238.</ref>

According to Penelope Farmer's personal blog site, she was in 2012 living on [[Lanzarote]] in the [[Canary Islands]]. She there described herself as "a writer – published for many years, now struggling", and listed "her grandchildren" among those she loved and missed. Other relations were mentioned: the departure of her daughter and a granddaughter (23 April 2004). The 22 April 2010 entry states that her son was among those staying with her, with his daughters aged eight and twelve.<ref>{{cite web|title=Blogger: User Profile: granny p|url=http://www.blogger.com/profile/10208296185844897146|website=www.blogger.com|access-date=18 February 2011}}</ref>{{better source|date=January 2017}}

==Writing career==
Farmer's first publication was ''The China People'', a collection of literary fairy tales for young people, in 1960.<ref name=bookrags /> One story written for this collection was judged too long to include. This was re-written as the first chapter of her first novel for children, ''[[The Summer Birds]]''. In 1963, this received a [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] commendation and was cited as an [[American Library Association Notable Book]].<ref name=suthor1999 /> ''The Summer Birds'' was soon followed by its sequels, ''[[Emma in Winter]]'' (1966) and ''[[Charlotte Sometimes (novel)|Charlotte Sometimes]]'' (1969), and by ''A Castle of Bone'' (1972), ''Year King'' (1977), ''Thicker than Water'' (1989), ''Penelope: A Novel'' (1993), and ''Granny and Me'' (1998).

Farmer stated that she, while writing ''Emma in Winter'', did not realize that identity was such a predominant theme in the novel until she encountered [[Margery Fisher]]'s comments on the book. She had a similar realization, this time on her own, while writing ''Charlotte Sometimes''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Writers, Critics, and Children |last=Penelope |first=Fisher |editor1=Geoff Fox |editor2=Graham Hammond |editor3=Terry Jones |editor4=Frederic Smith |editor5=Kenneth Sterck |year=1976 |publisher=Agathon Press |location=New York |isbn=0-87586-054-0 |pages=60 }}</ref>
