'''Edgar Albert Guest''' (20 August 1881 &ndash; 5 August 1959) was a British-born American [[poet]] who became known as the People's Poet. His poems often had an inspirational and optimistic view of everyday life.

==Early life==
Guest was born in [[Birmingham]], [[England]] in 1881. In 1891, his family moved from England to Detroit, Michigan, where Guest lived until he died.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Foundation|first=Poetry|date=2021-03-19|title=Edgar Albert Guest|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/edgar-albert-guest|access-date=2021-03-19|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en}}</ref>

==Career==
After he began at the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' as a copy boy and then a reporter, his first poem appeared on 11 December 1898. He became a [[naturalized citizen]] in 1902. For 40 years, Guest was widely read throughout [[North America]], and his sentimental, optimistic poems were in the same vein as the [[light verse]] of [[Nick Kenny (poet)|Nick Kenny]], who wrote syndicated columns during the same decades.

From his first published work in the ''Detroit Free Press'' until his death in 1959, Guest penned some 11,000 poems which were syndicated in some 300 newspapers and collected in more than 20 books, including ''A Heap o' Livin''' (1916) and ''Just Folks'' (1923–1957). Guest was made [[Poet Laureate]] of Michigan, the only poet to have been awarded the title.

His popularity led to a weekly Detroit radio show which he hosted from 1931 until 1942, followed by a 1951 [[NBC]] television series, ''A Guest in Your House''.<ref name=Daytime>{{cite book |last1=Hyatt |first1=Wesley |title=The Encyclopedia of Daytime Television |date=1997 |publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications |isbn=978-0823083152 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofda00hyat/page/194/mode/2up|access-date=22 March 2020|page=194}}</ref> He also had a thrice-weekly [[Electrical transcription|transcribed]] radio program that began January 15, 1941, and was sponsored by [[Land O'Lakes]] Creameries. The program featured singer [[Eddy Howard]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Land O'Lakes Series|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/41-OCR/1941-01-12-BC-OCR-Page-0032.pdf|access-date=15 April 2016|agency=Broadcasting|date=January 13, 1941|page=32}}</ref>

Guest was made a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] in Detroit, where he was a lifetime member of Ashlar Lodge No. 91. In honor of Guest's devotion to the Craft, community, and humanity in general, the [[Grand Lodge of Michigan|Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of Michigan]] established the Edgar A. Guest Award for lodges to present to non-Masons within the community who have demonstrated distinguished service to the community and their fellow man.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/guest_e/guest_e.html|title=Edgar Albert Guest|last=McKeown|first=Trevor W.|website=freemasonry.bcy.ca|access-date=2017-01-13}}</ref>

==Reputation==
Guest's work still occasionally appears in periodicals such as ''[[Reader's Digest]]'', and some favorites, such as "Myself" and "Thanksgiving," are still studied today. However, in one of the most quoted appraisals of his work, [[Dorothy Parker]] reputedly said:  "I'd rather flunk my [[Wassermann test]] than read a poem by Edgar Guest."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Andrews|first1=Clarence|title=Michigan in Literature|date=1992|publisher=Wayne State University Press|isbn=0814323685|page=260}}</ref>

Edgar Guest is depicted on the badge worn by the crew of [[Count Olaf]]'s submarine ''Carmelita'' in ''[[The Grim Grotto]]'', the eleventh book in [[Lemony Snicket]]'s ''[[Series of Unfortunate Events]]''. In the book Guest is mocked as a "writer of limited skill, who wrote awkward, tedious poetry on hopelessly sentimental topics" (''The Grim Grotto'' (2004) p.&nbsp;281).

In the novel ''[[I Am Legend (novel)|I Am Legend]]'', the main character Robert Neville sardonically comments on his own internal monologue: "The last man in the world is Edgar Guest".<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard Matheson|author-link=Richard Matheson|title=I Am Legend|title-link=I Am Legend (novel)|publisher=Nelson Doubleday|date=1954|page=68}}</ref>

[[Tracey Gold]] did read Guest's poem "A Child Of Mine" during the funeral of [[Judith Barsi]].
