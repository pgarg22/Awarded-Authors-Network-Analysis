'''Abraham Regelson''' (1896–1981; [[Hebrew]]: אברהם רגלסון) was an Israeli [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] poet, author, [[children's author]], translator, and editor.

==Biography==
Abraham Regelson was born in [[Hlusk]], now [[Belarus]], in the [[Russian Empire]] in 1896, and died at his home in [[Neveh Monossohn]], [[Israel]] in 1981. His parents were Yehuda Zeev Regelson and Rashel Ozick.

He is the maternal uncle of [[Cynthia Ozick]].

===In the United States===
Regelson emigrated with his family to the United States when he was nine years old. He studied at a [[heder]] and public schools. He never finished formal studies, but was an [[autodidact]] who spent many hours in libraries. At first he earned his livelihood as a librarian and Hebrew teacher, and began publishing his poetry, stories and translations in various Hebrew publications, both in America and in what was then early Jewish Palestine. His first [[Aliyah|aliya]] (immigration) to [[Eretz Israel]] was in the year 1933. Employed by the daily newspaper ''[[Davar]]'', he was one of the founders of the children's weekly supplement ''Davar l'Yladim'', where his well-loved classic "Masa HaBubot l'Eretz-Yisrael" ("The Dolls' Journey to Eretz Israel") was first published in installments. Three years later, after having lost an infant son, and with two of his older children endangered by [[malaria]], he returned to the US with his family. There he earned his living by writing for the Yiddish press, while publishing several books containing his Hebrew poetry, legends and philosophical essays.

===In Israel in 1949===
After Israel's establishment, he returned there in 1949. Appointed as an editor for the publishing house [[Am Oved]], he was also on the staff of the daily newspaper ''[[Al Ha-Mishmar]]'', where he featured as a regular columnist.

Regelson's language is uniquely original, combining the old and the new in a captivating style. His innovative usages contributed to the rejuvenation of the Hebrew tongue. The influence of English literature added an appealing flavor to his work. He was a prolific translator and enriched Hebrew with many classics of English literature.
