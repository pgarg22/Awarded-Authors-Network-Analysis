Ellison was born to a Jewish family<ref>[http://www.jewishjournal.com/geekheeb/item/top_5_jewish_moments_in_trek_20090507/ ''Jewish Journal'': "Top 5 Jewish moments in 'Trek'" by Adam Wills] May 7, 2009</ref> in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], Ohio, on May 27, 1934, the son of Serita (née Rosenthal) and Louis Laverne Ellison, a dentist and jeweler.<ref>*{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3nPYfqEbfrsC&q=Serita+Rosenthal+Louis+Laverne+Ellison&pg=PA889|title=Science Fiction and Fantasy Literature, Volume 2|website=[[Google Books]]|publisher=Wildside Press LLC|date=2010|isbn=9780941028783|access-date=November 11, 2020|archive-date=June 5, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210605010603/https://books.google.com/books?id=3nPYfqEbfrsC&q=Serita+Rosenthal+Louis+Laverne+Ellison&pg=PA889|url-status=live}}</ref> He had an older sister, Beverly (Rabnick), who was born in 1926. She died in 2010 without having spoken to him since their mother's funeral in 1976. His family subsequently moved to [[Painesville, Ohio|Painesville]], Ohio, but returned to Cleveland in 1949, following his father's death. Ellison frequently ran away from home (in an interview with [[Tom Snyder]] he would later claim it was due to discrimination by his high school peers), taking an array of odd jobs—including, by age 18, "tuna fisherman off the coast of [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]], itinerant crop-picker down in New Orleans, hired gun for a wealthy neurotic, [[nitroglycerine]] truck driver in [[North Carolina]], [[wikt:short order|short-order]] cook, cab driver, [[lithographer]], book salesman, [[wikt:floor-walker|floorwalker]] in a department store, door-to-door brush salesman, and as a youngster, an actor in several productions at the [[Cleveland Play House]]".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ellison |first=Harlan |url=http://www.bookrags.com/studyguide-mouthmustscream/bio.html |title=Harlan Ellison's "I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream": A Study Guide from Gale's "Short Stories for Students" |date=July 23, 2002 |publisher=The Gale Group |page=27 |access-date=January 4, 2007 |archive-date=October 20, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020113212/http://www.bookrags.com/studyguide-mouthmustscream/bio.html |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1947, a fan letter he wrote to ''[[Real Fact Comics]]'' became his first published writing.<ref name="OSPG">{{Cite book |last=Overstreet |first=Robert M. |title=Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide, 41st edition |title-link=Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide |date=2011–2012 |publisher=[[Gemstone Publishing]] |isbn=9781603601337 |location=[[Timonium, Maryland]] |page=808}}</ref>

Ellison attended [[Ohio State University]] for 18 months (1951–53) before being expelled. He said the expulsion was for hitting a professor who had denigrated his writing ability, and over the next 20 or so years he sent that professor a copy of every story that he published.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Levy |first=Michael |date=November 2002 |title=Books in Review, "Of Stories and the Man." |url=http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/birs/bir88.htm |journal=Science Fiction Studies |volume=29 |issue=Part 3 |access-date=January 4, 2007 |archive-date=January 13, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070113223223/http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/birs/bir88.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

Ellison published two serialized stories in the ''[[Cleveland News]]'' during 1949,<ref name=isfdb /> and he sold a story to [[EC Comics]] early in the 1950s. During this period, Ellison was an active and visible member of [[science fiction fandom]], and published his own [[science fiction fanzines]], such as ''Dimensions'' (which had previously been the ''Bulletin of the Cleveland Science Fantasy Society'' for the Cleveland Science Fantasy Society, and later ''Science Fantasy Bulletin''.<ref>''Dimensions'' issue #14 (May–July 1954)</ref>)  Ellison moved to New York City in 1955 to pursue a writing career, primarily in science fiction. Over the next two years, he published more than 100 short stories and articles. The short stories collected as ''Sex Gang'' — which Ellison described in a 2012 interview as "mainstream [[erotica]]"<ref name="larecord">{{Cite web|url=https://larecord.com/interviews/2012/09/24/harlan-ellison-everything-is-awful|title=HARLAN ELLISON: EVERYTHING IS AWFUL|access-date=February 13, 2021|archive-date=February 11, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210211220627/https://larecord.com/interviews/2012/09/24/harlan-ellison-everything-is-awful|url-status=live}}</ref> — date from this period.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.islets.net:80/collections/sexgang.html |title=Ellison / Sex Gang |date=January 6, 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106122233/http://www.islets.net/collections/sexgang.html |archive-date=January 6, 2013 |access-date=March 20, 2019 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Hollywood and beyond===
[[File:Sfcon-ellison-talk-ddb.jpg|thumb|Ellison speaking at an SF convention, 2006]]
Ellison moved to California in 1962 and began selling his writing to Hollywood. He co-wrote the screenplay for ''[[The Oscar (film)|The Oscar]]'' (1966), starring [[Stephen Boyd]] and [[Elke Sommer]]. Ellison also sold scripts to many television shows: ''[[The Loretta Young Show]]'' (using the name Harlan Ellis),''[[The Flying Nun]]'', ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]'', ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]],'' ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'',<ref name="TheFuturist">Keegan, Rebecca (October 5, 2010).

Ellison's screenplay for the ''Star Trek'' episode "[[The City on the Edge of Forever]]" has been considered the best of the 79 episodes in the series.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.startrek.com/article/original-city-on-the-edge-of-forever-teleplay-set-for-miniseries |title=Original "City on the Edge of Forever" Teleplay Set for Miniseries |last=Staff writers |date=March 6, 2014 |website=StarTrek.com |access-date=June 29, 2018 |quote=Harlan Ellison wrote what is widely considered the best episode ever of ''Star Trek: The Original Series''. |archive-date=June 29, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180629211647/http://www.startrek.com/article/original-city-on-the-edge-of-forever-teleplay-set-for-miniseries |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1966, in an article that ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine later named as the best magazine piece ever written, the journalist [[Gay Talese]] wrote about the goings-on around [[Frank Sinatra]]. The article, entitled "[[Frank Sinatra Has a Cold]]", briefly describes a clash between the young Harlan Ellison and Frank Sinatra, when the crooner took exception to Ellison's boots during a billiards game.<ref>{{Cite magazine |title=Frank Sinatra Has a Cold – Gay Talese – Best Profile of Sinatra |url=http://www.esquire.com/features/ESQ1003-OCT_SINATRA_rev_ |magazine=Esquire |access-date=July 27, 2014 |archive-date=August 2, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802180737/http://www.esquire.com/features/ESQ1003-OCT_SINATRA_rev_ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Ellison was hired as a writer for [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Studios]], but was fired on his first day after [[Roy O.

Ellison continued to publish short fiction and nonfiction pieces in various publications, including some of his best known stories. "[["Repent, Harlequin!" Said the Ticktockman|'Repent, Harlequin!' Said the Ticktockman]]" (1965) is a celebration of civil disobedience against repressive authority. "[[I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream]]" (1967) is a story where five humans are tormented by an all-knowing computer throughout eternity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vocal.media/futurism/i-have-no-mouth-and-i-must-scream|title='I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream'|website=Futurism|access-date=February 13, 2021|archive-date=February 25, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210225102241/https://vocal.media/futurism/i-have-no-mouth-and-i-must-scream|url-status=live}}</ref> The story was the basis of a 1995 [[I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream (video game)|computer game]]; Ellison participated in the game's design and provided the voice of the god-computer AM.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2016/01/14/classic-gi-i-have-no-mouth-and-i-must-scream.aspx|title=Classic GI: I Have No Mouth, And I Must Scream|first=Jeff|last=Cork|website=Game Informer|access-date=June 29, 2018|archive-date=June 29, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180629235737/https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2016/01/14/classic-gi-i-have-no-mouth-and-i-must-scream.aspx|url-status=live}}</ref> Another story, "[[A Boy and His Dog]]", examines the nature of friendship and love in a violent, [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic science fiction|post-apocalyptic]] world and was made into the 1975 [[A Boy and His Dog (1975 film)|film of the same name]], starring [[Don Johnson]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://catalog.afi.com/Film/55518-A-BOY-AND-HIS-DOG?sid=2b5e56ce-720b-4fc3-9fde-efcbb65c8b06&sr=5.6351666&cp=1&pos=0 |title=AFI Catalog of Feature Films: A Boy and His Dog |website=AFI.com |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |access-date=16 April 2019 |archive-date=August 1, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200801123546/http://catalog.afi.com/Film/55518-A-BOY-AND-HIS-DOG?sid=2b5e56ce-720b-4fc3-9fde-efcbb65c8b06&sr=5.6351666&cp=1&pos=0 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1967, Ellision edited the ''[[Dangerous Visions]]'' collection, which attracted 'special citation at the 26th World SF Convention for editing "the most significant and controversial SF book published in 1967."' In his introduction [[Isaac Asimov]] described it epitomising a 'second revolution' in Science Fiction as 'science receded and modern fictional techniques came to the fore'. 

From 1968 to 1970, Ellison wrote a regular column on television for the ''[[Los Angeles Free Press]]''. Titled "The Glass Teat," Ellison's column examined television's impact on the politics and culture of the time, including its presentations of sex, politics, race, the Vietnam War, and violence. The essays were collected in two anthologies, ''[[The Glass Teat|The Glass Teat: Essays of Opinion on Television]]''<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ellison |first1=Harlan |title=The Glass Teat |date=1983 |orig-date=1970 |publisher=Ace |isbn=9780441289882 |url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/453228.The_Glass_Teat |access-date=5 June 2021 |archive-date=February 20, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210220060548/https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/453228.The_Glass_Teat |url-status=live }}</ref> followed by ''The Other Glass Teat''.

Ellison served as creative consultant to the [[The Twilight Zone (1985 series)|1980s version]] of ''The Twilight Zone'' science fiction TV series and ''[[Babylon 5]]''. As a member of the [[Screen Actors Guild]] (SAG), he had voice-over credits for shows, including ''[[The Pirates of Dark Water]]'', ''[[Mother Goose and Grimm#Television show|Mother Goose and Grimm]]'', ''[[Space Cases]]'', ''[[Phantom 2040]]'', and ''Babylon 5'', as well as making an onscreen appearance in the ''Babylon 5'' episode "[[The Face of the Enemy (Babylon 5)|The Face of the Enemy".]]

Ellison's short story "The Man Who Rowed Christopher Columbus Ashore" (1992) was selected for inclusion in the 1993 edition of ''[[The Best American Short Stories]]''.<ref>Kennison, Katrina and Erdrich, Louise (editors), ''The Best American Short Stories 1993'', New York, 1993.</ref>

In 2014, Ellison made a guest appearance on the album ''Finding Love in Hell'' by the [[stoner metal]] band [[Leaving Babylon]], reading his piece "The Silence" (originally published in ''[[Mind Fields]]'') as an introduction to the song "Dead to Me."<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=862491530432253&set=pb.512974005384009.-2207520000.1405998586.&type=1&theater |title=Leaving Babylon – Leaving Babylon's Photos |publisher=Facebook |access-date=July 27, 2014 |archive-date=March 8, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308211645/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=862491530432253&set=pb.512974005384009.-2207520000.1405998586.&type=1&theater |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Personal life and death===
Ellison married five times; each relationship ended within a few years, except the last. His first wife was Charlotte Stein, whom he married in 1956. They divorced in 1960, and he later described the marriage as "four years of hell as sustained as the whine of a generator."<ref>''Gentleman Junkie'', 14</ref> Later that year he married Billie Joyce Sanders; they divorced in 1963.

==Pseudonyms==
{{anchor|Cordwainer Bird}}
Ellison on occasion used the pseudonym '''Cordwainer Bird''' to alert members of the public to situations in which he felt his creative contribution to a project had been mangled by others, beyond repair, typically Hollywood producers or studios (see also [[Alan Smithee]]). The first such work to which he signed the name was "The Price of Doom", an episode of ''[[Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (TV series)|Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea]]'' (though it was misspelled as Cord Wainer Bird in the credits).<ref>{{Cite news |last=Vinciguerra |first=Thomas |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/20/arts/television/20vinc.html |title=Never Silent, Not Very Deep |date=20 August 2006 |work=The New York Times |access-date=16 April 2019 |archive-date=April 17, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190417004644/https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/20/arts/television/20vinc.html |url-status=live }}</ref> An episode of ''Burke's Law'' ("Who Killed Alex Debbs?") credited to Ellison contains a ''character'' given this name, played by [[Sammy Davis Jr.]]<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Who Killed Alex Debbs? |series=Burke’s Law |url=https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0533832/?ref_=m_ttfc_tt |date=25 October 1963 |access-date=March 1, 2021 |archive-date=June 5, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210605010645/https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0533832/?ref_=m_ttfc_tt |url-status=live }}</ref>

The "Cordwainer Bird" moniker is a tribute to fellow SF writer Paul M. A. Linebarger, better known by his pen name, [[Cordwainer Smith]]. The origin of the word "[[cordwainer]]" is shoemaker (from working with [[shell cordovan|cordovan]] leather for shoes). The term used by Linebarger was meant to imply the industriousness of the [[pulp magazine|pulp]] author.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}} Ellison said, in interviews and in his writing, that his version of the pseudonym was meant to mean "a shoemaker for birds". Since he used the pseudonym mainly for works he wanted to distance himself from, it may be understood to mean that "this work is for the birds" or that it is of as much use as shoes to a bird. [[Stephen King]] once said he thought that it meant that Ellison was giving people who mangled his work a literary version of "[[Finger (gesture)|the bird]]" (given credence by Ellison himself in his own essay titled "Somehow, I Don't Think We're in Kansas, Toto", describing his experience with the ''[[Starlost]]'' television series).<ref name="Essential">Ellison, Harlan [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Essential-Ellison-35-Year-Retrospective/dp/0962344737 "The Essential Ellison: A 35-Year Retrospective"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180630000134/https://www.amazon.co.uk/Essential-Ellison-35-Year-Retrospective/dp/0962344737 |date=June 30, 2018 }} ({{ISBN|0962344737}})</ref>

The Bird moniker became a character in one of Ellison's own stories. In his 1978 book ''[[Strange Wine]]'', Ellison explains the origins of the Bird and goes on to state that [[Philip José Farmer]] wrote Cordwainer into the [[Wold Newton family]] that the latter writer had developed. The thought of such a whimsical object lesson being related to such lights as Doc Savage, The Shadow, Tarzan, and all the other pulp heroes prompted Ellison to play with the concept, resulting in "The New York Review of Bird", in which an annoyed Bird uncovers the darker secrets of the New York literary establishment before beginning a pulpish slaughter of the same.<ref name="Strange">Ellison, Harlan [https://www.amazon.com/Strange-Wine-Fifteen-stories-nightside/dp/0060111135 "Strange Wine"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726233434/https://www.amazon.com/Strange-Wine-Fifteen-stories-nightside/dp/0060111135 |date=July 26, 2018 }} ({{ISBN|0060111135}})</ref>

==Controversies and disputes==

===Temperament===
Ellison had a reputation for being abrasive and argumentative.{{efn|In his Introduction to "I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream", [[Theodore Sturgeon]] describes Ellison as: "...a man on the move, and he is moving fast. He is, on these pages and everywhere else he goes, colorful, intrusive, ABRASIVE ... and one hell of a writer."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ellison |first=Harlan |url=http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?41300 |title=i have no mouth and i must scream |date=April 1967 |publisher=Pyramid Paperbacks |location=final paragraph |access-date=February 9, 2018 |archive-date=February 10, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210003028/http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?41300 |url-status=live }}</ref>}} He generally agreed with this assessment, and a [[dust jacket]] from one of his books{{which|date=July 2018}} described him as "possibly the most contentious person on Earth." Ellison filed numerous grievances and attempted lawsuits; as part of a dispute about fulfillment of a contract, he once sent 213 bricks to a publisher [[postage due]], followed by a dead [[gopher]] via fourth-class mail.<ref>[http://harlanellison.com/text/newsfaq.txt "alt.fan.harlan-ellison FAQ" Version 1.5] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103185619/http://harlanellison.com/text/newsfaq.txt |date=November 3, 2012 }}.

At [[Stephen King]]'s request, Ellison provided a description of himself and his writing in ''[[Danse Macabre (book)|Danse Macabre]]'': "My work is foursquare for chaos. I spend my life personally, and my work professionally, keeping the soup boiling. [[wikt:gadfly|Gadfly]] is what they call you when you are no longer dangerous; I much prefer troublemaker, malcontent, desperado. I see myself as a combination of [[Zorro]] and [[Jiminy Cricket]].

Precisely."<ref>{{Cite news |last=King |first=Stephen |title=Chapter 9: Horror Fiction |work=Danse Macabre}}</ref>

===''Star Trek''===
Ellison repeatedly criticized how ''Star Trek'' creator and producer [[Gene Roddenberry]] (and others) rewrote his original script for the 1967 episode "The City on the Edge of Forever". Despite his objections, Ellison kept his own name on the shooting script instead of using "Cordwainer Bird" to indicate displeasure ([[#Pseudonyms|see above]]).<ref>{{cite book|title = These Are the Voyages: TOS, Season One|page=514|first1= Marc |last1= Cushman|first2= Susan|last2= Osborn|date = 2013|isbn = 9780989238120|publisher = Jacobs/Brown Press}}</ref>

Although the university was no longer solely a military school (from 1965), the student body was predominantly made up of cadet members. Between Ellison's anti-military remarks and a food fight that broke out in the ballroom of the hotel where the gathering was held (although, according to Ellison in 2000, the food fight actually started in a [[Denny's]] because the staff disappeared and they could not get their check), the school's administration almost refused to approve the science fiction convention the next year and no guest of honor was invited for the next two Aggiecons. However, Ellison was subsequently invited back as Guest of Honor for Aggiecon V (1974).{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}

===''The Last Dangerous Visions''===
''[[The Last Dangerous Visions]]'' (TLDV), the third volume of Ellison's anthology series, was originally announced for publication in 1973, but had not {{As of|2020|lc=y}} been published.<ref name="deadloss" /> Nearly 150 writers, many now dead, submitted works for the volume.

British science fiction author [[Christopher Priest (novelist)|Christopher Priest]] criticized Ellison's editorial practices in an article entitled "The Book on the Edge of Forever",<ref name="deadloss">{{Cite book |last=Priest |first=Christopher |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XlAFAAAACAAJ |title=The book on the edge of forever: an enquiry into the non-appearance of Harlan Ellison's The last dangerous visions |publisher=Fantagraphics Books |year=1994 |isbn=978-1-56097-159-7 |location=Seattle, WA |oclc=34231805 |author-link=Christopher Priest (novelist) |access-date=November 11, 2020 |archive-date=June 5, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210605010613/https://books.google.com/books?id=XlAFAAAACAAJ |url-status=live }}</ref> later expanded into a book. Priest documented a half-dozen unfulfilled promises by Ellison to publish ''TLDV'' within a year of the statement. Priest claims that he submitted a story at Ellison's request, which Ellison retained for several months until Priest withdrew the story and demanded that Ellison return the manuscript. Ellison was incensed by "The Book on the Edge of Forever" and, personally or by proxy, threatened Priest on numerous occasions after its publication.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ansible.co.uk/writing/cpriest.html |title=Christopher Priest interview (1995) |publisher=Ansible.co.uk |access-date=June 12, 2012 |archive-date=July 16, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716065215/http://www.ansible.co.uk/writing/cpriest.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

In November 2020, the executor of the Harlan Ellison estate, J. Michael Straczynski, announced on Patreon that he was proceeding with the final preparations for the publication of TLDV with the proceeds to go to the Harlan and Susan Ellison Trust. The book was expected to be published in April 2021, as significant publisher interest was expressed.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Straczynski|first=J.

Christopher Priest was unimpressed, saying that  Straczynski was "in the same sort of unenviable position as [[Donald Trump|Trump]]'s caddie", but as an experienced professional would possibly work something out. He added "I kind of lost interest in all that years ago. Ellison clearly did too, along with everyone else. (Although I gather he went on with his magical thinking if anyone asked when he was going to deliver). Many of the stories were withdrawn, because Ellison acted like a dick. Of the ones that remain, most of them are by writers who are now deceased, so the rights have expired and the estates would have to be traced. A lot of the writers have disowned their stories as juvenilia, or outdated, or simply because Ellison was acting like a dick."<ref>{{Cite news |title=Harlan Ellison's The Last Dangerous Visions may finally be published, after five-decade wait |last=Flood |first=Alison |newspaper=The Guardian |date=16 November 2020 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/nov/16/harlan-ellison-the-last-dangerous-visions-anthology-may-be-published |access-date=November 16, 2020 |archive-date=November 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116165436/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/nov/16/harlan-ellison-the-last-dangerous-visions-anthology-may-be-published |url-status=live }}</ref>

===''I, Robot''===
Shortly after the release of ''Star Wars'' (1977), [[Ben Roberts (writer)|Ben Roberts]] contacted Ellison to develop a script based on [[Isaac Asimov]]'s ''[[I, Robot]]'' short story collection for [[Warner Brothers]]; Ellison and Asimov had been longtime friends<!-- Asimov didn't die until 1992, so what the heck is this about? -->, so Ellison may be presumed to have attached particular significance to the project. In a meeting with the Head of Production at Warners, [[Robert Shapiro (film producer)|Robert Shapiro]], Ellison concluded that Shapiro was commenting on the script without having read it and accused him of having the "intellectual and cranial capacity of an artichoke". Shortly afterwards, Ellison was dropped from the project. Without Ellison, the film came to a dead end, because subsequent scripts were unsatisfactory to potential directors. After a change in studio heads, Warner allowed Ellison's script to be serialized in ''[[Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine]]'' and published in book form.<ref>

===Allegations of assault on Charles Platt===

===Lawsuit against Fantagraphics===
On September 20, 2006, Ellison sued comic book and magazine publisher [[Fantagraphics]], stating they had [[defamation|defamed]] him in their book ''Comics As Art (We Told You So)''.<ref>[[Tom Spurgeon|Spurgeon, Tom]], and Jacob Covey. ''Comics As Art: We Told You So''. Seattle, WA: [[Fantagraphics]], 2006. {{ISBN|978-1-56097-738-4}}</ref> The book recounts the history of Fantagraphics and discussed a lawsuit that resulted from a 1980 Ellison interview with Fantagraphics' industry news magazine, ''[[The Comics Journal]]''. In this interview Ellison referred to comic book writer [[Michael Fleisher]], calling him "bugfuck" and "derange-o". Fleisher lost his libel suit against Ellison and Fantagraphics on December 9, 1986.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://news.ansible.co.uk/c_platt.html |title=The Insanity Offense |access-date=March 1, 2007 |archive-date=July 31, 2010 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5rdgg2w62?url=http://news.ansible.co.uk/c_platt.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Ellison, after reading unpublished drafts of the book on Fantagraphics's website, believed that he had been defamed by several anecdotes related to this incident. He sued in the Superior Court for the State of California, in Santa Monica. Fantagraphics attempted to have the lawsuit dismissed. In their [[Motion (legal)|motion to dismiss]], Fantagraphics argued that the statements were both their personal opinions and generally believed to be true anecdotes. On February 12, 2007, the presiding judge ruled against Fantagraphics' anti-[[Strategic lawsuit against public participation|SLAPP]] motion for dismissal.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tcj.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=413&Itemid=70 |title=Harlan Ellison sues Fantagraphics |access-date=March 1, 2007 |archive-date=January 19, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070119113846/http://www.tcj.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=413&Itemid=70 |url-status=live }}</ref> On June 29, 2007, Ellison claimed that the litigation had been resolved<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://pwbeat.publishersweekly.com/blog/2007/06/29/it-is-finished/ |title=IT IS FINISHED |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120714062343/http://pwbeat.publishersweekly.com/blog/2007/06/29/it-is-finished/ |archive-date=July 14, 2012 |access-date=August 1, 2007 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> pending Fantagraphics' removal of all references to the case from their website.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://comicsbeat.com/feud-shoe-waiting-to-drop/ |title=Feud shoe waiting to drop |date=July 18, 2007 |access-date=January 13, 2014 |archive-date=January 14, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114010616/http://comicsbeat.com/feud-shoe-waiting-to-drop/ |url-status=live }}</ref> No money or apologies changed hands in the settlement as posted on August 17, 2007.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://pwbeat.publishersweekly.com/blog/2007/08/16/you-boys-play-nice-now/ |title=You Boys Play Nice Now |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120715222130/http://pwbeat.publishersweekly.com/blog/2007/08/16/you-boys-play-nice-now/ |archive-date=July 15, 2012 |access-date=August 20, 2007 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Copyright suits===
In a 1980 lawsuit against [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[Paramount Pictures]], Ellison and [[Ben Bova]] claimed that the TV series ''[[Future Cop (TV series)|Future Cop]]'' was based on their short story "Brillo", winning a $337,000 judgement.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jncRAAAAIBAJ&pg=6726%2C264576 |title=Two sci-fi writers given damages in copyright infringement lawsuit |work=Eugene Register-Guard |access-date=June 17, 2014 |agency=UPI |issue=May 1, 1980 |archive-date=April 1, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200401221529/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jncRAAAAIBAJ&pg=6726%2C264576 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Ellison alleged that [[James Cameron]]'s film ''[[The Terminator]]'' drew from material from an episode of the original ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|Outer Limits]]'' which Ellison had scripted, "[[Soldier (The Outer Limits)|Soldier]]" (1964). [[Hemdale Film Corporation|Hemdale]], the production company and the distributor [[Orion Pictures]], settled out of court for an undisclosed sum and added a credit to the film which acknowledged Ellison's work.<ref name="LATimes">{{Cite news |last=Marx |first=Andy |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-07-07/entertainment/ca-2720_1_screen-credit |title=IT'S MINE: All Very Well and Good, but Don't Hassle the T-1000 |date=July 7, 1991 |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=June 29, 2018 |archive-date=October 12, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181012075349/http://articles.latimes.com/1991-07-07/entertainment/ca-2720_1_screen-credit |url-status=live }}</ref> Cameron objected to this acknowledgement and has since labeled Ellison's claim a "nuisance suit".<ref name=TheFuturist /> Some accounts of the settlement state that another ''Outer Limits'' episode written by Ellison, "[[Demon with a Glass Hand]]" (1964), was also claimed to have been plagiarized by the film, but Ellison stated that "''Terminator'' was not stolen from 'Demon with a Glass Hand,' it was a ripoff of my OTHER Outer Limits script, 'Soldier.{{' "}}<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://harlanellison.com/heboard/archive/bull0108.htm |title=The Ellison Bulletin Board: Comments Archive&nbsp;— 07/31/01 to 08/27/01 |last=Ellison |first=Harlan |date=August 12, 2001 |website=harlanellison.com |publisher=Harlan Ellison |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20180209160209/http://harlanellison.com/heboard/archive/bull0108.htm |archive-date=February 9, 2018 |access-date=February 9, 2018}}</ref>

In 1983, [[Marvel Comics]] released ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' #286, entitled "Hero", written by [[Bill Mantlo]]. Three issues later, Marvel put up a letter claiming that Mantlo adapted "Soldier" for use as a Hulk story, but they forgot to credit Ellison and had it pointed out by readers. In actuality, then-Editor-in-Chief Jim Shooter signed off on the story, not having seen the ''Outer Limits'' episode it was based on and not realizing Mantlo copied it wholesale. The day the issue went to stands, he was contacted by an angry Ellison, who calmed down after Shooter admitted the error. Although he could have claimed hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages, Ellison only requested the same payment Mantlo got for the story, writer's credit and a lifetime subscription to everything Marvel published.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cbr.com/hulk-harlan-ellison-soldier-credit/ |title=When Marvel 'Forgot' To Credit Harlan Ellison for a Comic |last=Cronan |first=Brian |date=June 29, 2018 |website=cbr.com |access-date=December 25, 2019 |archive-date=December 25, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191225054117/https://www.cbr.com/hulk-harlan-ellison-soldier-credit/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

On April 24, 2000, Ellison sued Stephen Robertson for posting four stories to the [[newsgroup]] "alt.binaries.e-book" without authorization. The other defendants were [[AOL]] and RemarQ, an [[internet service provider]] who owned servers hosting the newsgroup. Ellison alleged they had failed to halt copyright infringement in accordance with the "Notice and Takedown Procedure" outlined in the 1998 [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]]. Robertson and RemarQ first settled with Ellison, and then AOL likewise settled with Ellison in June 2004, under conditions that were not made public. Since those settlements Ellison initiated legal action or takedown notices against more than 240 people who have allegedly distributed his writings on the Internet, saying, "If you put your hand in my pocket, you'll drag back six inches of bloody stump".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Rich |first=Motoko |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/12/technology/internet/12digital.html?src=sch |title=Print Books Are Target of Pirates on the Web |date=May 12, 2009 |work=The New York Times |access-date=May 10, 2009 |archive-date=May 12, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512184016/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/12/technology/internet/12digital.html?src=sch |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Parodies and pastiches of Ellison==
In the 1970s artist and cartoonist Gordon Carleton wrote and drew a scripted [[Slideshow|slide show]] called "City on the Edge of Whatever", which was a spoof of "[[The City on the Edge of Forever]]". Occasionally performed at ''Star Trek'' conventions, it features an irate writer named "Arlan Hellison" who screams at his producers, "Art defilers! Script assassins!"<ref>{{Cite book |last=Carleton |first=Gordon |title="City on the Edge of Whatever" Coloring Book |publisher=T'Kuhtian Press |year=1978}}</ref>

Justice League of America #89 ("The Most Dangerous Dreams Of All") 1971, written by Mike Friedrich, is centered around a character named Harlequin Ellis. The character is smitten with Black Canary, and injects himself into Justice League adventures, taking on the role of different heroes in his attempts to woo her. Ellison himself had written several comic book scripts.

[[Ben Bova]]'s novel ''The Starcrossed'' (1975), a ''[[roman à clef]]'' about Bova and Ellison's experience on ''[[The Starlost]]'' TV series,<ref>[http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/starlost_the SF Encyclopedia entry] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214040115/http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/starlost_the |date=February 14, 2014 }} about The Starlost</ref> features a character "Ron Gabriel" who is a pastiche of Ellison. Bova's novel is dedicated to Ellison's pseudonym "Cordwainer Bird", who was credited as series creator on ''The Starlost'' per Ellison's demand. In the novel, "Ron Gabriel" requires the fictional series producers to credit him under the pseudonym "[[Victor Frankenstein|Victor]] [[Lawrence Talbot]] [[Victor Frankenstein|Frankenstein]]".<ref>Ben Bova, [https://books.google.com/books?&id=C1AgAQAAIAAJ&dq=bova+%22victor+lawrence+talbot+frankenstein%22&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=+%22victor+lawrence+talbot+frankenstein%22 Laugh Lines] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508052942/https://books.google.com/books?&id=C1AgAQAAIAAJ&dq=bova+%22victor+lawrence+talbot+frankenstein%22&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=+%22victor+lawrence+talbot+frankenstein%22 |date=May 8, 2016 }} ({{ISBN|1416555609}}) (collection containing The Starcrossed and some other works), p. 162.</ref>

In ''[[Murder at the ABA]]'' (1976) by Isaac Asimov, the protagonist, Darius Just, was based on Ellison, as stated by Asimov in footnotes to the book itself, and in his autobiographical volume ''In Joy Still Felt''.

[[Robert Silverberg]] named a character in his first novel, ''[[Revolt on Alpha C]]'' (1955), for Ellison, who was Silverberg's neighbor in New York City at the time he was writing the book. This was confirmed in a special edition on the occasion of Silverberg's 35th year in the business.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.majipoor.com/work.php?id=940 |title=Revolt on Alpha C by Robert Silverberg |last=Davis |first=Jon |website=Majipoor.com: The Works of Robert Silverberg |access-date=April 17, 2016 |archive-date=May 8, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508145759/http://www.majipoor.com/work.php?id=940 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Sharyn McCrumb]]'s mystery novel ''[[Bimbos of the Death Sun]]'' (1988) featured a cantankerous antagonist-turned-murder-victim based on Ellison{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}. Fans of Ellison sent him copies of the book, and upon meeting Ellison later that year at the [[Edgar Award]]s, Ellison told McCrumb he had read the book and thought it was good.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/sharynmccrumb/posts/10204871827432376 |title=Facebook |website=[[Facebook]] |language=en |access-date=June 28, 2018 |archive-date=March 7, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210307234952/https://www.facebook.com/sharynmccrumb/posts/10204871827432376 |url-status=live }}</ref><!-- this page gives incorrect publisher "Cromwell" -->
