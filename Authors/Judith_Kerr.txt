== Life in London ==
During the Second World War, Judith Kerr worked for the [[Red Cross]], helping wounded soldiers, before being awarded a scholarship to study at the [[Central School of Arts and Crafts]] and becoming an artist. She met her future husband, screenwriter [[Nigel Kneale|Nigel "Tom" Kneale]], in the BBC canteen. He wrote the cult TV science-fiction serial ''[[The Quatermass Experiment]]'' for which Kerr helped make and operate the special effects. Kneale later prompted her to apply for a job as a BBC television scriptwriter.<ref name="obituary" /> Kerr naturalised as a [[British subject]] on 21 June 1947.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=38052 |date=22 August 1947 |page=3959}}</ref>

Kerr and Kneale were married in 1954; they remained married until his death in 2006. They had two children, a daughter [[Tacy Kneale|Tacy]] (born 1958) and a son [[Matthew Kneale|Matthew]] (born 1960). Matthew is also a writer, winning the Book of the Year prize at the [[2000 Whitbread Awards|Whitbread Book Awards in 2000]] for the novel ''[[English Passengers]]''.<ref name="grannies" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.matthewkneale.net/about.php|title=Matthew Kneale Biography|website=www.matthewkneale.net|access-date=24 May 2019}}</ref> Tacy is an actress, [[animatronics]] artist and painter;<ref name=Tacy>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tacykneale.com/about.html|title=Tacy Kneale|website=www.tacykneale.com|access-date=24 May 2019}}</ref> as an animatronics designer, she initially worked for [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]] before working independently in [[special effects]].

Kerr lived in the same house in [[Barnes, London]], from 1962 until her death on 22 May 2019.<ref name="home">{{cite news |last1=Pires |first1=Candice |title=On the prowl: inside the home of the author of The Tiger Who Came To Tea |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/mar/04/house-where-tiger-came-to-tea-judith-kerr-candice-pires |access-date=25 September 2019 |work=The Guardian |date=4 March 2017}}</ref><ref name="grannies" />

== Books ==
Kerr is best known for her children's books. Although she dreamed of being a famous writer as a child, she only started writing and drawing books when her own children were learning to read.<ref name="grannies">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/judith-kerr-if-carlsberg-made-grannies-1782542.html|title=Judith Kerr: If Carlsberg made grannies...|last=Guest|first=Katy|date=6 September 2009|work=[[The Independent]]|access-date=6 September 2009}}</ref> She wrote self-illustrated picture titles, such as the 17-book ''[[Mog (Judith Kerr)|Mog]]'' series and ''[[The Tiger Who Came to Tea]]''.<ref name="grannies" /> The character of Mog was based on a real-life tabby who would sit on Kerr's lap as she worked.<ref name="economist" />

As well as young children's books, Kerr wrote children's novels such as the semi-autobiographical ''[[Out of the Hitler Time]]'' trilogy (''When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit'', ''Bombs on Aunt Dainty'' (originally published as ''The Other Way Round'') and ''A Small Person Far Away''), which tell the story, from a child's perspective, of the rise of the Nazis in 1930s Germany and life as a refugee, life in Britain during World War II and life during the post-war years and the Cold War respectively.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/nov/29/judith-kerr-tiger-came-tea|title=Tiger! Tiger! burning bright – interview with Judith Kerr, author of The Tiger Who Came to Tea|last=Armitstead|first=Claire|date=29 November 2008 |work=The Guardian|access-date=6 September 2009}}</ref> Again it was her children who occasioned this writing: when her son was eight he saw ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' and remarked, "now we know what it was like when Mummy was a little girl". Kerr wanted him to know what it was really like and so wrote ''When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article467903.ece|title=Love etc|last=O'Brien|first=Catherine |date=11 August 2004|work=[[The Times]]|access-date=6 September 2009}}</ref> The story was based on her regret over choosing to take a stuffed dog toy with her when her family fled Germany rather than a beloved pink rabbit toy.<ref name="economist"/> The young adult novel won the [[Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis]] in 1974.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/corporate2/mediacentre/proginfo/2012/28/private-passions|title=Private Passions : Judith Kerr|work=BBC Media Centre|access-date=20 July 2019}}</ref>  A [[When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit (film)|cinematic adaption]] of ''When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit'' premiered in December 2019 in Germany, directed by [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning director [[Caroline Link]].

Kerr said that since the death of her husband writing had become more important than ever.<ref name="grannies" /> She continued to write and illustrate children's books: ''Twinkles, Arthur and Puss'' were published in 2008,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.harpercollins.co.uk/9780007254477/twinkles-arthur-and-puss|title=Twinkles, Arthur and Puss by Judith Kerr – Paperback &#124; HarperCollins|website=HarperCollins UK}}</ref> and ''One Night in the Zoo'' in 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.harpercollins.co.uk/9780007321131/one-night-in-the-zoo|title=One Night in the Zoo by Judith Kerr – Paperback &#124; HarperCollins|website=HarperCollins UK}}</ref>

Kerr was appointed [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the [[2012 Birthday Honours]] for services to children's literature and Holocaust education.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=60173|supp=y|page=23|date=16 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-18461536|title=Kenneth Branagh knighted in Queen's Birthday Honours|date=16 June 2012|work=BBC News|access-date=15 June 2012}}</ref>

== Death and legacy ==
Kerr died at her home on 22 May 2019, aged 95, following a short illness.<ref>{{cite news |date= 23 May 2019 |title= Tiger Who Came To Tea author Judith Kerr dies |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-48381415 |work= BBC News |access-date= 23 May 2019}}</ref><ref name=grauniad />
