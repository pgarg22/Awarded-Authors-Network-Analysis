== Early life ==

Donna Stone and her brother grew up near [[Bexley, Ohio]], an affluent suburb of Columbus, in a strict family of German descent. She suffered two bouts of rheumatic fever as a child, and was bedridden for several months at a time. She had private tutors and was known to be a bright child, so illness did not impede her education. She later told a biographer that her interest in writing was born during these periods of sickness and isolation.<ref name=Biography>''American Poetry Society Biography: Donna J. Stone'' (1996 American Poetry Society, Inc.). Retrieved 2009-12-31.</ref>

Stone's health improved, and she grew into an attractive young lady. She met and married her first husband, writer and aspiring playwright [[John Pascal]], whose works would later include the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[George M!]]''<ref>''George M!'' (Book by John Pascal, Francine Pascal, and Michael Stewart: Tams-Witmark, 1968; NBC, 1970). Retrieved 2010-01-05.</ref> The couple had a son and moved to New York. While her husband began to make a name for himself as a journalist and published author, Donna J. Pascal focused on rearing their son and supporting her husband's career.  (She also had a brief foray into fashion modeling, which was humorously described to an interviewer years later.)<ref name=Interview>Interview with Bobbie Wygant, KXAS-TV News, Dallas/Fort Worth (NBC, 1991). Retrieved 2010-05-01.</ref>  The Pascals' young son contracted a terrible illness.  The child survived, but not unscathed, and the marriage eventually ended.<ref name=About>''Donna J.

== Philanthropy ==

These difficult times saw the beginning of a new chapter in Pascal's life.  She became a strong supporter of the fledgling Association for Retarded Children,<ref name=ARC>The Arc (Assoc. for Retarded Children: New York, 1950–1954; Assoc. for Retarded Citizens: Arlington, TX, 1970–1974; The Arc: Arlington, TX, 1980–1981). Retrieved 2009-12-29.</ref> thus beginning a lifelong career as charity supporter and children's advocate.  Pascal's involvement often went beyond financial or administrative. One such example was her role in exposing the abuse and neglect of mentally challenged children in New York's infamous [[Willowbrook State School]], once described by Senator [[Robert F. Kennedy]] as a "snake pit."<ref name=Willowbrook>''Willowbrook: A Report on How It Is and Why It Doesn't Have to Be That Way'' (Geraldo Rivera, 1972, Random House). Retrieved 2010-05-01.</ref> As she later described in an interview,<ref name=Interview /> Pascal gained access to the residential school by posing as a recent social work graduate, and spent several days working in the "back wards."  She then shared her observations with members of the press, as did several others.  After a host of media attention, including the Peabody Award-winning series by [[Geraldo Rivera]], the institution was eventually closed by the state.<ref name=Willowbrook />

Her second marriage was to L. E. Stone, a former pilot with an interest in real estate. Donna J. Stone maintained her charitable activities, expanding her endeavors to include the National Committee for the Prevention of Child Abuse.<ref name=PCA>Prevent Child Abuse America (Nat'l Comm. for the Prevention of Child Abuse: Donna J. Stone, 1972; PCA America: Maura Somers Dughi and Michael Bolton, 1999). Retrieved 2009-12-29.</ref> The Stones also had one son and, due to L.E. Stone's business interests, the family eventually moved from New York to a suburb of Dallas. The Association for Retarded Children also moved their headquarters from New York to suburban Dallas, and Donna Stone remained a strong supporter. Several years later she established the Matthew J. Pascal Foundation,<ref name=Foundation /> a private family foundation named after her older son.

== Poetry ==

It was in Texas that Stone began writing in earnest. Although she dabbled in prose, her passion was poetry. Her early publications were in local newspapers and small periodicals.  Later, her works appeared in poetry magazines and poetry society journals, some of them receiving honors and small awards.  On her mother's 75th birthday, Stone published a poem for her in her local paper.  The poem got picked up by the local's parent company, and was printed in dozens of newspapers. "Mother at 75" <ref name=Poems>1989-1991 Donna J. Stone, 2010 Christopher K. Stone. Retrieved 2010-05-29.</ref> became Stone's most recognized poem to date.<ref name=Biography />

''Wielder of Words: A Collection of Poems''<ref name=Wielder /> soon followed.  According to the author's acknowledgments, the title was based upon a poem written as a birthday card for Stone by her younger son, who edited the book. Included in the collection were poems such as "Another Autumn",<ref name=Poems /> and "Remembering",<ref name=Poems /> and of  "Mother at 75."  Stone accepted no profits from the book, and donated copies to various schools, libraries, literacy programs, and poetry societies.  One school reportedly used it as a textbook, and the American Poetry Society chose ''Wielder of Words'' as their 1991 Book of the Year.<ref name=Book />

== Final years ==

The cardiac effects of her severe childhood illness began taking their toll, and Stone's health once again declined. Yet she continued to write, and during her final years composed some of her best-known poems including "Changing Seasons"<ref name=Poems /> and, perhaps her most famous and most personal, "Of Matt and Me".<ref name=About /><ref name=Poems />

Donna J. Stone died of heart failure at her home in Texas. She was 61. In cooperation with  American Mothers, Inc., Stone's children founded the Donna J. Stone National Literary Awards in her honor.<ref>American Mothers, Inc. (Anna Reeves Jarvis and Sarah Delano Roosevelt, 1935; AMI, 2007).
