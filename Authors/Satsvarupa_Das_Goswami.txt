He was born Stephen Guarino,<ref name=hc/> the elder of two children, to Italian [[Roman Catholic]] parents in [[Staten Island]], New York.
He was educated initially in a [[public high school]] nearby and then enrolled in the [[Brooklyn College]], where he underwent an intellectual revolution putting in question his Catholic values. In the college he read [[Nietzsche]] and [[Dostoevsky]] and associated with students and professors who were religious skeptics.<ref name = shinn1>{{Harvnb|Shinn|1987|p=44}}</ref><ref name = cite_note-11>{{cite book

{{Quotation|As soon as I went to college I underwent an intellectual revolution. Any religious sentiments I had gained from my mother were driven away by my college professors, who were dyed-in-the-wool Marxist intellectuals, Americans from the 1930s. They taught me their intellectual and atheistic views, and knocked aside my religious worship, saying it was sentimental. One of them said theology could never satisfactorily explain why evil was present in the world. I was attracted to their philosophy because my parents were not intellectual and had never aroused my intellectual capacity. But my professors opened up a whole new world for me. I became eager to study philosophy and literature. I came to see for myself that the church was hypocritical: in the foyer of our church the priests regularly raffled bottles of liquor (they called them "baskets of joy"). I became dissatisfied with the [[Catholic Church]] because it could not provide answers to my questions.|Satsvarupa dasa Goswami|With Śrīla Prabhupāda in the Early Days, 1966–1969: A Memoir| Introduction<ref name = cite_note-11/>}}
In January 1962 he joined the [[US Navy|Navy]], where he served for two years on board of [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|U.S.S. Saratoga]], a super-carrier. In his introduction to ''With Śrīla Prabhupāda in the Early Days, 1966–1969'' he writes: "A few months after the death of President Kennedy, I was honorably discharged, and without visiting my parents on Staten Island, I went directly to the Lower East Side. By then, the Lower East Side was, in my mind and in the minds of my friends, the most mystical place in the world."<ref name = cite_note-11/> "I certainly didn't think some guru was suddenly going to appear and save me. I was too cynical. Yet I was regularly reading versions of the [[Bhagavad-gita]] and the [[Upanishad]]s. Ironically, one week before the gift shop at 26 Second Avenue changed into Srila Prabhupada's temple, I was standing in that very doorway with a Bhagavad-gita in my back pocket, waiting to meet a friend. Somehow we had chosen 26 Second Avenue as a meeting place. At that time, I had no idea what was about to happen."<ref name = cite_note-11/>

[[File:Satsvarupa-das-goswami-ACBSP.jpg|upright|thumb|left| Satsvarupa dasa Goswami with [[A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada|Bhaktivedanta Swami]] in 1974]]

In July 1966 he met and accepted a spiritual instruction from A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami who registered [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|ISKCON]] a month later. Bhaktivedanta Swami soon began assigning him typing tasks which Satsvarupa understood "to be yoga".<ref name = john>John P Reis, ''God is Not Dead; He Has Simply Changed Clothes: A Study of the International Society for Kṛṣṇa Consciousness'' University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1975, p.145</ref> On September 23, 1966 he was ordained and shortly became one of the leading figures of the new [[Gaudiya Vaishnava]] movement.<ref name = shinn1/><ref>Letter by [[A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada|Bhaktivedanta Swami]], November 11, 1967 to Brahmananda, "I do not want crowd of [[Kirtanananda Swami|Kirtananandas]] but I want a single soul like Brahmananda, Mukunda, Rayarama, and <u>Satsvarupa</u>.

After Bhaktivedanta Swami died, he was one of eleven disciples selected to become an initiating guru in ISKCON. Prof. [[Larry Shinn]] in his overview of the contemporary state of the Bhaktivedanta Swami's movement confirms this while relating his first meeting with Satsvarupa dasa Goswami:

{{Quotation|Thing that caused me to correct my initial prejudices about the Krishnas was that those who joined the movement came through several modes of conversion and from many different backgrounds.  Satsvarupa dasa Goswami, who later was appointed as one of Prabhupada's guru successors, was one of the earliest devotees I met.  He was in his late twenties when I met him in New York City.  He had discovered the Krishnas as a result of a spiritual quest which was satisfied within this Indian tradition.|L.Shinn|The Maturation of the Hare Krishnas in America|1994<ref name = Shinn/>}}

In a typical [[diksa|initiation]] ceremony as a [[ISKCON Guru System|guru]] of [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] he would begin with purification using ''[[achamana]]'' (holy water) and concludes with a sermon on the importance of chanting of the [[holy names]] in the life of a new initiate.<ref name = shinn2>{{Harvnb|Shinn|1987|p=104}}</ref>

==Personal servant of Bhaktivedanta Swami==
In addition to periods of being a GBC personal assistant, the brief period between January and July 1974 during which he had the opportunity to act as a personal servant and secretary to the founder of [[ISKCON]], Bhaktivedanta Swami, is noted. During this time his duties included bringing Bhaktivedanta Swami his medicine and toothbrush in the morning, accompanying him on his morning walk, preparing his breakfast and lunch and providing his daily massage. In other words, the tasks were those of a menial servant, while Satsvarupa das Goswami was excited about it. Some note that the first time Satsvarupa gave Bhaktivedanta Swami a massage it was "an intense spiritual experience" for him:<ref name = Kimmo3/>

{{quote|Massaging Prabhupada was like new initiation. From my side, it was completely spiritual, ecstatic exchange, the essence of the personal servant's worship of the spiritual master.|Life With the Perfect Master}}

One may understand how the service given to one's [[guru]] can be of such a value by seeing it in the ritual religious context. The theme of status difference, enriched with the idea of intimacy, coalesce in this simple pattern of devotee massaging the spiritual master's legs and feet in the cultural models expressed in [[puja (Hinduism)|puja]] and innumerable other [[Vaishnava]] contexts. Satsvarupa took the posture of a menial servant with evident relish. It is also taken as an example of ideal typical model of the guru-disciple relationship as a disciple should always consider him- or herself a menial servant of the spiritual master.<ref name = Kimmo3>{{Harvnb|Ketola|2008|pp=113–117}}</ref>

Bhaktivedanta Swami's personal typist and ISKCON secretary for the first year.<ref name = john/><ref>''Passage from India: The Life and Times of His Divine Grace A.C Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada'', Steven Rosen, Satsvarūpa Dāsa Goswāmī, 1992, Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers, Page 99</ref> He was one of the few devotees who maintained outside jobs to support the ISKCON temple at the beginning.<ref>{{cite book

After assuming duties of a GBC ([[Governing Body Commission]]er) in 1970, Satsvarupa was asked by Bhaktivedanta Swami to accept the order of [[sannyasa]] in 1972. He accepted sannyasa along with other GBC members, all of whom were originally married men, such as [[Tamala Krishna Goswami]] and [[Hridayananda dasa Goswami]]. At the time A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami awarded him and other followers the title "[[Goswami]]" with the single line instruction: "Preach, preach, preach!"<ref name =PPP>{{cite book |author = Goswami |title =Srila Prabhupada Lilamrta Vol 5| publisher = BBT| page = 95}}</ref> He is sometimes listed among active promoters of ahimsa among other Eastern religious teachers.<ref name =PP2>{{citation|author = Nick Kokoshis |title =Remember Eastern Religious Teachers |magazine= Vegetarian Times| publisher = Active Interest Media| date = November 1985 | page = 99 |issn=0164-8497}}</ref>

===Preaching and traveling===
Main preaching activities by the means of traveling [[sankirtana]] parties were centered in United States. BBT ([[Bhaktivedanta Book Trust]]) Library Party headed by him in the mid-1970s was active in establishing distribution network mainly to the Universities of the United States, with some members of the team such as [[Bhakti Tirtha Swami]] and [[Suhotra Dasa]] traveling as far as Eastern Europe.

In 1974, Satsvarupa dasa Goswami was requested by Bhaktivedanta Swami to join him as traveling GBC servant, replacing previous servant Srutakirti Dasa and travelled as a menial servant around the globe.<ref name = KK>{{cite book

===Dealing with early "zonal acarya" days===
In accordance with [[ISKCON]] GBC [[Governing Body Commission]] resolutions March 1978 Satsvarupa dasa Goswami along with other eleven Governing Body Commissioners assumed duties and services of initiating disciples in assigned zones after the death of [[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada|Bhaktivedanta Swami]].<ref>See: ''[[Back to Godhead]]'', Notes from the Editor, #1301/02 1978</ref><ref>{{cite book

While following the direction of [[Governing Body Commission]], Satsvarupa dasa Goswami was one of the pioneers who attempted to reform the system, by assuming more humble and appropriate role of a guru as per recorded instructions of the "Founder-[[acharya|Acarya]]."<ref name = GRN/> While imitation of Bhaktivedanta Swami was criticised, despite these warnings, specifically by Satsvarupa dasa Goswami, such imitation sometimes resulted in curious side-effects and many devotees adopted Bhaktivedanta Swami's mannerisms. This remained evident especially among the older American devotees who even now speak with an Indian accent and display many of Bhaktivedanta Swami's gestures like turning one's head or moving one's hand in a certain way.<ref name = Kimmo4>{{Harvnb|Ketola|2008|loc=part seven}}</ref>

===Later years===
In years 1978–1985 he took part in a controversial zonal acarya system in a position of an [[Acharya]] while initiating reform of a high standard of worship. In 1986–1987 a number of senior members and newly appointed GBC members with the support of Satsvarupa dasa Goswami reformed ISKCON guru system, lowering unprecedented level of worship reserved to initiating gurus in ISKCON. He was called as the "most vocal in the cause of reform" in ISKCON.<ref>{{cite book

In 2002, he suffered a physical and emotional collapse from chronic migraine headaches, a condition that required immediate medical intervention and treatment.
