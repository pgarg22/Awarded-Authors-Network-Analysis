'''Władysław Kazimierz Broniewski''' (17 December 1897, [[Płock]] – 10 February 1962, [[Warsaw]]) was a [[Poland|Polish]] poet, writer, translator and soldier. Known for his revolutionary and patriotic writings.

==Life==

He was the son of Antoni, a bank clerk. As a young man, Broniewski joined in 1915 [[Polish Legions in World War I|the legions]] of [[Józef Piłsudski]].<ref name="Miłosc">[http://www.polskieradio.pl/5/3/Artykul/491208,Milosc-wodka-polityka-czyli-biografia-Broniewskiego Miłość, wódka, polityka, czyli biografia Broniewskiego at PolskieRadio.pl]</ref> As a member of the [[1st Legions Infantry Regiment]], he participated in the [[Polish–Soviet War]] and in 1920 fought in the [[Battle of Białystok]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Spis oficerów służących czynnie w dniu 1.6.1921 r. Dodatek do Dziennika Personalnego M.S.Wojsk. Nr 37 z 24 września 1921 r.|pages=21, 568}}</ref> He was decorated for bravery with the order of [[Virtuti Militari]].

Broniewski developed [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] sympathies and by the late 1920s he was a [[revolution]]ary poet. In summer 1931, he was arrested during a literary meeting of writers connected with the [[Communist Party of Poland]] (KPP) along with Jan Hempel and [[Aleksander Wat]]. He was helped by [[Bolesław Wieniawa-Długoszowski]].<ref name="Wat">{{cite book|last1=Wat|first1=Aleksander|title=Mój wiek|date=1990|location=Warsaw}}</ref>

When Poland was [[Invasion of Poland|attacked in 1939]] by [[Germany]], he wrote an important poem encouraging Poles to put away political differences and fight the aggressors. After Poland was [[Soviet invasion of Poland|invaded]] by the [[Soviet Union]], Broniewski found himself in Soviet-occupied [[Lviv|Lwów]]. His poems were printed in a Soviet-published newspaper, but he was soon arrested by the [[NKVD]] on trumped-up charges of "hooliganism". He refused to co-operate with the NKVD and after four months was transported to the [[Lubyanka Building|Lubianka prison]] in [[Moscow]], where he stayed for  thirteen months.<ref name="Wat"/><ref name="Miłosc"/>  Afterwards, he worked at the [[Polish government-in-exile|Polish embassy]] in [[Samara|Kuybyshev]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Czapski|first1=Józef|title=Na nieludzkiej ziemi}}</ref> He left the Soviet Union with the [[Anders' Army|Polish army]] led by General [[Władysław Anders]] and through [[Iran]] came to [[Iraq]] and then [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].<ref>[https://www.granice.pl/wyszukaj/Broniewski/1 Władysław Broniewski (1897.12.17 - 1962.02.10) at granice.pl]</ref>

After World War II and the establishment of the [[Polish People's Republic]], he compromised by writing in 1951 a poem ''Słowo o Stalinie'' ('A Word about Stalin'). Subsequently, Broniewski became an important political figure and was proclaimed a foremost national poet by the authorities. He still managed to preserve a certain degree of independence, and some of his poems from this period are a testimony to his talent. He had also been an accomplished translator of poetry and prose, translating, among others, [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], [[Sergei Yesenin]], [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], and [[Bertolt Brecht]].

During the last years of Broniewski's life, his health had been ruined by alcohol abuse. He died in [[Warsaw]].

==Poetry==

Broniewski's poetry deals with problems of human life in the context of historical events, such as wars and revolutions (for example, the [[Paris Commune]]), and with questions of justice, fight for freedom, patriotism and personal suffering. This last aspect is evident in the cycle ''Anka'', dedicated to the memory of tragically deceased poet's daughter Anna, who was gas-poisoned on 1 September 1954 (often compared to [[Jan Kochanowski]]'s ''Laments''). Another important Broniewski's poem is ''Ballady i romanse'', alluding to the title of [[Adam Mickiewicz]]'s collection. ''Ballady i romanse'' is about [[the Holocaust]]. Its hero is a thirteen years old [[Jews|Jewish]] girl Ryfka, who dies together with [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] shot by the [[Nazism|Nazis]]. Broniewski was conservative regarding poetic form. He used classical forms of [[Verse (poetry)|verse]], traditional [[Metre (poetry)|metres]] and [[stanza]]s. He often employed the [[Dactyl (poetry)|dactylic]] metre.<ref>Wiktor Jarosław Darasz, Polski daktyl, Język Polski 3-4/2000, p. 257-265.</ref>
