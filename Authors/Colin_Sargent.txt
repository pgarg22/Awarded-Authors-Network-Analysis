==Accomplishments==

Colin Sargent was the winner of a Maine Individual Artist Fellowship in Literature presented by the [[Maine Arts Commission]]. His play "100 Percent [[American Girl]]," is about the imagined return of [[World War II]] radio propagandist [[Mildred Elizabeth Sisk|Axis Sally]] (a.k.a. Mildred Sisk and Mildred Gillars) to a modern [[Nursing home|congregate care facility]] in her old hometown—where some retired GIs' ears prick up at the sound of her voice.  It was a winner at the Maine Playwrights Festival and was produced at the Maine Festival and Arts Conservatory Theater and Studio (ACTS).

His first book of poetry was ''Luftwaffe Snowshoes'' (Portsmouth Arts Center), followed by ''Blush'' and ''Undertow'', both published by Coyote Love Press. ''Undertow'' earned Pick of the Month notice in ''Small Press Review''. According to ''Poet Lore'': “Reading Colin Sargent’s poetry is like opening a dark bag and having a thread leap out, then several more threads fusing to luminous bands of music, one after another, along with crazy potatoes, a phone growing like a black plant, perhaps a [[Beverage can|soda can]] discarded on the beach off [[Kennebunkport, Maine]]. In Undertow, his latest book, Sargent’s collocations of the magical and the mundane work together brilliantly.”

In 2009, Sargent's novel ''[[Museum of Human Beings]]'' was published by McBooks. ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' observed and noted, “Playwright Sargent’s debut novel is a stylish look at the fate of [[Sacagawea]]’s baby son, [[Jean Baptiste Charbonneau]]… An impressively rounded portrait of the laid-back, introspective, nomadic Baptiste, this novel will satisfy fans of American history.” According to [[Library Journal]], "From the beginning to the novel's spellbinding conclusion, playwright and poet Sargent allows us an intimate glimpse into what could have been the heart of Jean-Baptiste. This memorable novel will captivate all who read it. Highly recommended for all public library historical fiction collections."
