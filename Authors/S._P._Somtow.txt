==Youth==
A descendant of the Royal [[Chakri dynasty]] (his [[Indrasakdi Sachi|grandfather's sister]] was a cousin and consort of King [[Vajiravudh]]),{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Somtow was born in Bangkok. He moved to England with his parents in 1953 at the age of six months. English was his first language.<ref name="OS-Bio">{{cite web |title=SOMTOW SUCHARITKUL |url=https://www.operasiam.com/somtow |website=Opera Siam |access-date=6 October 2019}}</ref><ref name=SEAWrite>{{cite web |title=SOMTOW'S SEA WRITE AWARDS KEYNOTE SPEECH: 'Reinventing oneself as a Southeast Asian writer' |url=https://www.somtow.com/seawrite-speech |website=Somtow.com |access-date=6 October 2019 |date=15 October 2006}}</ref> Somtow was educated at [[Eton College]] and at [[St Catharine's College, Cambridge]]. He returned to Thailand in the early-1960s for a five-year period, during which he became fluent in the Thai language. At age 11, he wrote a poem called "Kith of Infinity", which was published in the English-language ''[[Bangkok Post]]''. [[Shirley MacLaine]] saw it, and thinking that it was written by a dead poet, included it in her autobiography, ''[[Don't Fall Off the Mountain|Don’t Fall Off the Mountain]]''.<ref>{{cite book | last=MacLaine | first=Shirley | title=Don't Fall Off the Mountain | location=New York | publisher=W.W. Norton & Company Limited | year=1970 | isbn=978-0-393-07338-6}}</ref> The poem contains the line "I am not a man", as Somtow was not yet an adult. It is thought that this prompted MacLaine to assume that the author was a woman.<ref name=SEAWrite/>

==Science fiction==
As a science fiction writer, Somtow is known for several series, among which are the ''[[Mallworld]]'', ''[[Inquestor]]'', and ''[[Aquila (novel series)|Aquila]]'' series. He first was published as '''Somtow Sucharitkul''' in the late-1970s in [[Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine|''Asimov’s'']] and [[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|''Analog'']]<ref>Analog: ''The Thirteenth Utopia'', April 1979; ''Absent Thee from Felicity Awhile'', September 1981, ''Fiddling for Waterbuffalos'', April 1986</ref> science fiction magazines. He wrote several stories and novels under that name before changing his [[pen name]] to S. P. Somtow.

==Horror==
He wrote ''[[Vampire Junction]]'' and a series of related novels and stories. He was president of the [[Horror Writers Association]] from 1998 to 2000. His other horror books include the werewolf-[[Western novel]] ''[[Moon Dance (novel)|Moon Dance]]'', the zombie-American Civil War novel ''[[Darker Angels]]'', and the collections ''[[Tagging the Moon: Fairy Tales of L.A.]]'' and ''[[The Pavilion of Frozen Women]]''.

He also wrote and directed the cult horror film ''[[The Laughing Dead (movie)|The Laughing Dead]]'' and co-wrote the Roger Corman-produced ''Bram Stoker's Burial of the Rats'' (1995).

==Other literary works==
Somtow's novel, ''[[Jasmine Nights]]'', a semi-autobiographical novel set in Thailand in the 1960s, has become his best known fictional work. The historical fantasy ''The Shattered Horse'' holds that [[Hector]]'s son [[Astyanax]] survives the fall of [[Troy]] and grows to adulthood to meet many of the characters of the ''[[Iliad]].''

==Symphonic works==
He has also composed five [[Symphony|symphonies]] and a [[ballet]], ''Kaki''. Other musical compositions include the “Requiem: In Memoriam 9/11,” commissioned by the government of Thailand as a gift for the victims of the 9/11 events and inspired by the poetry of [[Walt Whitman]], [[Emily Dickinson]], and [[T. S. Eliot]].

In 2000, he composed ''[[Madana (opera)|Madana]]'', the first orchestral Western [[opera]] by a Thai composer and based on a [[Thai language]] play by [[Rama VI|King Rama VI]].<ref>Mertens, Brian, [http://www.iht.com/articles/2001/02/24/opera.t.php "A Thai's Grand Design for Opera"], ''International Herald Tribune'', 24 February 2001{{failed verification|date=October 2019}}</ref> The opera was in English. His second opera on a Thai theme, ''[[Mae Naak (opera)|Mae Naak]]'', premiered in 2003 and a third opera, ''[[Ayodhya (opera)|Ayodhya]]'', was first performed in November, 2006.<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/11/15/arts/AS_A-E_MUS_Thailand_Ramayana_Opera.php "Thailand's enfant terrible of opera tackles the Asian classic Ramayana"], ''International Herald Tribune'', 14 November 2006{{failed verification|date=October 2019}}</ref> His opera ''The Silent Prince'' was premiered in Houston by [[Opera Vista]] on 15 October 2010. A fifth opera, ''Dan no Ura'', received its premiere in August 2014 in Bangkok.

He is currently at work on two operas, one an adaptation of his fantasy short story "The Fallen Country" and another about the life of Holocaust survivor, Helena Citronova. "The Snow Dragon", the adaptation of his fantasy story, is set to premiere 13 March 2015, at the Skylight Music Theatre in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, under the baton of Viswa Subbaraman.

In 2012 his musical, ''Reya the Musical'', based on a serialized novel by his mother which had already been made into a popular Thai TV soap, premiered at the Aksra Theatre in Bangkok and ran for twenty performances.

He has conducted the Thailand premieres of many key repertoire operas such as [[Thaïs]], [[Otello]], and [[The Rape of Lucretia]]. He embarked on a venture to conduct all of [[Mahler]]'s symphonies in Thailand, and the cycle was completed with No. 2 in 2015.

==Performing ensembles==
In the 1970s Somtow Sucharitkul formed the [[Temple of Dawn Consort]] with [[Dnu Huntrakul]] and [[Bruce Gaston (musician)|Bruce Gaston]], an eclectic performing ensemble devoted to a fusion of Thai and Western music styles and instruments, performing music by these the three composers. After his 1979 departure for the United States, the group evolved into other fusion ensembles, the most notable being Bruce Gaston's [[Fong Naam]] ensemble. On his return to Thailand, Somtow founded, in addition to [[Bangkok Opera]], the [[Siam Philharmonic Orchestra]] and the [[Siam Sinfonietta]], a youth symphony orchestra. He also founded the [[Orpheus Choir of Bangkok]], traveling all over Thailand and performing many of Somtow Sucharitkul's pieces.

==SEA Award speech==
When [[Nobel Prize]] laureate [[Wole Soyinka]] withdrew as keynote speaker at the 2006 [[S.E.A. Write Award]]s ceremony in protest of the [[2006 Thailand coup|ouster]] of the elected government of [[Thaksin Shinawatra]], Somtow, a critic of Thaksin, replaced Soyinka as keynote speaker. In his speech, Somtow berated Soyinka for boycotting the awards and claimed that in 50 years, he had never felt more free.<ref name="SEAWrite" /> Soon afterward, Somtow's opera ''Ayodhya'' was censored by state officials under the junta, who claimed that the on-stage death of the demon-king, Thotsakan, would constitute a "bad omen" for the military junta. Somtow agreed to modify the scene and was forced to sign a document giving officials the right to "immediately shut down the opera in mid-performance if, in their sole opinion, a breach of 'tradition' occurs."<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/11/18/arts/AS_A-E_MUS_Thailand_Operatic_Intrigue.php "Citing 'bad omen', Thai government censors Ramayana opera"], ''International Herald Tribune'', 18 November 2006{{failed verification|date=October 2019}}</ref><ref>Somtow, S.

Somtow has been critical of all sides in the political disputes following the [[2006 Thailand coup]].<ref name=SW-Plague/> Although he was a critic of the [[populism|populist]] government of Thaksin, Somtow stated that, "The righteous indignation of Thaksin's opposition, however, went beyond the pale when they started to say that the poor shouldn't vote because they're too stupid." Somtow praised a speech by [[Democrat Party (Thailand)|Democrat]] Prime Minister [[Abhisit Vejjajiva]] for being, "so balanced, so reasonable, so intelligent, and so well thought through,..."<ref name=SW-Plague>{{cite web |last1=Somtow |first1=S.P. |title=A Plague on Both Your Houses |url=http://www.somtow.org/2009/04/plague-on-both-your-houses.html |website=Somtow's World |access-date=6 October 2019}}</ref>

In 2008, he became one of the first recipients of the newly created Silpathorn Kittikhun Award, awarded by Thailand's [[Ministry of Culture (Thailand)|Culture Ministry]]. The Silpathorn Kittikhun Award has been viewed as an alternative to the more "staid, traditional National Artist Awards."<ref>[https://archive.today/20120723085007/http://www.dailyxpress.net/2008/08/06/entertainment/entertainment_3922.php "National Treasures"], ''Daily Xpress'', 6 August 2008</ref> In December 2011, Thai newspaper ''[[The Nation (Thailand)|The Nation]]'' selected him as one of the 40 most internationally acclaimed Thais.<ref>[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/top40/detail/7068 40 Most internationally acclaimed Thais] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119113658/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/top40/detail/7068 |date=2012-01-19 }}</ref>  In 2013 he was awarded the "Golden W" by the International Wagner Society for ten years of service in presenting the music of Wagner in the region.
