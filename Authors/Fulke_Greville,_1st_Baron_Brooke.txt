'''Fulke Greville, 1st Baron Brooke, '''''de jure''''' 13th Baron Latimer '''and''' 5th Baron Willoughby de Broke''' [[Order of the Bath|KB]] [[Privy Counsellor|PC]] ({{IPAc-en|f|ʊ|l|k|_|ˈ|g|r|ɛ|v|ɪ|l}}; 3 October 1554 – 30 September 1628), known before 1621 as '''Sir Fulke Greville''', was an [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] [[poet]], [[dramatist]], and [[politician|statesman]] who sat in the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] at various times between 1581 and 1621, when he was raised to the peerage.

Greville was a capable administrator who served the English Crown under [[Elizabeth I]] and [[James I of England|James I]] as, successively, treasurer of the navy, chancellor of the exchequer, and commissioner of the Treasury, and who for his services was in 1621 made Baron Brooke, peer of the realm. Greville was granted [[Warwick Castle]] in 1604, making numerous improvements. Greville is best known today as the biographer of [[Sir Philip Sidney]], and for his sober poetry, which presents dark, thoughtful and distinctly [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] views on art, literature, beauty and other philosophical matters.

==Life==
Fulke Greville, born 3 October 1554, at Beauchamp Court, near [[Alcester]], [[Warwickshire]], was the only son of [[Sir Fulke Greville]] (1536–1606) and Anne Neville (d. 1583), the daughter of [[Ralph Neville, 4th Earl of Westmorland]].<ref name="Gouws 2004">{{Harvnb|Gouws|2004}}</ref> He was the grandson of Sir Fulke Greville (d. 10 November 1559) and [[Elizabeth Willoughby, 3rd Baroness Willoughby de Broke|Elizabeth Willoughby]] (buried 15 November 1562), eldest daughter of [[Robert Willoughby, 2nd Baron Willoughby de Broke]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Richardson I|2011|pp=336–8}}; {{Harvnb|Richardson II|2011|p=269}}.</ref> the only other child of the marriage was a daughter, Margaret Greville (1561–1631/2), who married Sir Richard Verney.<ref name="Gouws 2004"/>

He was sent in 1564, on the same day as his lifelong friend, [[Philip Sidney]], to [[Shrewsbury School]].<ref>[http://dspace.dial.pipex.com/town/square/fk26/localpast/85sp/worth1.htm Worthies of the Area 1 - Fulke Greville III] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716181512/http://dspace.dial.pipex.com/town/square/fk26/localpast/85sp/worth1.htm |date=16 July 2012 }} Alcester & District Local History Society; Spring 1985.</ref> He then went up to [[Jesus College, Cambridge]] in 1568.<ref>{{acad|id=GRVL568F|name=Greville, Fulke}}</ref>

Sir [[Henry Sidney]], Philip's father, and president of the [[Council of Wales and the Marches]], gave Greville in 1576 a post connected with the court of the [[Welsh Marches]], but Greville resigned it in 1577 to go to attend court of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] along with Philip Sidney. There, Greville became a great favourite with the Queen, who valued his sober character and administrative skills. In 1581, he was elected in a by-election as [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Southampton (UK Parliament constituency)|Southampton]].<ref name = HoP>{{cite web | url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1558-1603/member/greville-fulke-1554-1628| title= History of Parliament|access-date = 2011-10-22}}</ref> Queen Elizabeth made him secretary to the principality of Wales in 1583. However he was put out of favour more than once for leaving the country against her wishes.

In 1581 at a Whitehall tournament in honour of French ambassadors Greville, Philip Sidney, [[Philip Howard, 20th Earl of Arundel|Philip Howard Earl of Arundel]] and Frederick Lord Windsor staged an entertainment as the "Four Foster Children of Desire". The ambassadors were working on plans for Elizabeth's marriage to [[Francis, Duke of Anjou]]. The "Foster Children" laid siege to the "Fortress of Perfect Beautie". After two days of challenges the Children admitted defeat. The entertainment was understood to convey the idea that Elizabeth was unattainable, devised by the opposition to the French marriage.<ref>Janet Dickinson, ''Court Politics and the Earl of Essex'' (Abingdon, 2016), pp. 29–30.</ref>

Greville, Philip Sidney and [[Sir Edward Dyer]] were members of the "[[Areopagus (poetry)|Areopagus]]", the literary clique which, under the leadership of [[Gabriel Harvey]], supported the introduction of classical metres into English verse. Sidney and Greville arranged to sail with [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]] in 1585 in his expedition against the Spanish West Indies, but Elizabeth forbade Drake to take them with him, and also refused Greville's request to be allowed to join [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley's]] army in the [[Netherlands]]. Philip Sidney, who took part in the campaign, was killed on 17 October 1586.  Greville memorialized his beloved friend in ''A Dedication to Sir Philip Sidney''.

Greville participated in the [[Battle of Coutras]] in 1587.<ref>Adriana McCrea, ''Constant Minds: Political virtue and the Lipsian paradigm in England, 1584-1650'' (1997), p. 107.</ref> About 1591 Greville served further for a short time in [[Normandy]] under [[King Henry III of Navarre]] in the [[French Wars of Religion]]. This was his last experience of war.

Greville represented [[Warwickshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Warwickshire]] in parliament in 1592–1593, 1597, 1601 and 1621. In 1598 he was made [[Treasurer of the Navy]], and he retained the office through the early years of the reign of James I.

Greville was granted [[Warwick Castle]]—situated on a bend of the River Avon in [[Warwickshire]]—by King James I in 1604.<ref name=Towers>{{cite web|title=The Ghost Tower of Warwick Castle|url=http://great-castles.com/warwickghost.php|publisher=Great Castles|access-date=26 December 2012}}</ref> The castle was in a dilapidated condition when he took possession of it, and he spent £20,000 to restore it to former glory.<ref name = HoP/><ref name=Alcester>{{cite web|title=Local Worthies 1 - Sir Fulke Greville III|url=http://dspace.dial.pipex.com/town/square/fk26/localpast/85sp/worth1.htm|work=Spring 1985 Index|publisher=Alcester & District Local History Society|access-date=26 December 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716181512/http://dspace.dial.pipex.com/town/square/fk26/localpast/85sp/worth1.htm|archive-date=16 July 2012}}</ref>

In 1614 he became chancellor and under-treasurer of the exchequer, and throughout the reign he was a valued supporter of James I, although in 1615 he advocated the summoning of Parliament. In 1618 he became commissioner of the treasury, and in 1621 he was raised to the peerage with the title of [[Baron Brooke]], a title which had belonged to the family of his paternal grandmother.

==Death and legacy==
In 1628 Greville was stabbed at his house in [[Holborn]], London by Ralph Haywood, a servant who believed that he had been cheated by being left out of his master's will. Haywood then turned the knife on himself. Greville's physicians treated his wounds by filling them with pig fat. Rather than disinfecting them, the pig fat turned rancid and infected the wounds, and he died in agony four weeks after the attack.<ref>'Holborn: The norther tributaries' in Volume 2, London Old and New, by Walter Thornbury (1878).</ref> His body was brought back to Warwick, and he was buried in the [[Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick]], and on his tomb was inscribed the epitaph he had composed:
<center>Folk Grevill<br>Servant to Queene Elizabeth<br>Conceller to King James<br>and Frend to Sir Philip Sidney.<br>Trophaeum Peccati.<ref name="Tudor Place">{{cite web|title=Fulke GREVILLE (1º B.

Castelli is not an expert|date=January 2015}}</ref></center>

Greville has numerous streets named after him in the [[Hatton Garden]] area of Holborn, London (see [[Hatton Garden#Street names etymologies]]).

A line from ''Chorus Sacerdotum'' from ''Mustapha'' is quoted by [[Christopher Hitchens]] in his book [[Letters to a Young Contrarian]].<ref>Hitchens, Christopher (2001). Letters to a young contrarian. Basic Books. p. xiii. {{ISBN|9780465030323}}.</ref>

In 2018 the first ever festival dedicated to Greville was launched in his home town, Alcester, Warwickshire.<ref>[http://www.fulkefest.org.uk www.fulkefest.org.uk]</ref>

==Works==
Greville is best known by his biography of Sidney (composed c. 1610–12), which circulated in manuscript with the title ''A Dedication to Sir [[Philip Sidney]]''. It was published in 1652 as ''The Life of the Renowned Sir Philip Sidney''.{{refn|group="n"|The complete title of the first octavo edition reads: ''The Life of the Renowned Sr. Philip Sidney. With the true Interest of England as it then stood in relation to all Forrain Princes: And particularly for suppressing the power of Spain Stated by Him: His principall Actions, Counsels, Designes, and Death. Together with a short account of the Maximes and Policies used by Queen Elizabeth in her Government.''}} He includes some autobiographical matter in what amounts to a treatise on government.

Greville's poetry consists of [[Closet drama|closet]] [[tragedies]], [[sonnet]]s, and poems on political and moral subjects. His style is grave and sententious.

Individual manuscripts of the ''Dedication to Sir Philip Sidney'' are to be found at the Bodleian Library, Oxford (a manuscript formerly owned by Dr. B. E. Juel-Jensen); Trinity College, Cambridge (MSS R.7.32 and 33); and the Shrewsbury Library (MS 295).

==Critical reception==
[[Charles Lamb]] commented on Greville: "He is nine parts Machiavel and Tacitus, for one of Sophocles and Seneca... Whether we look into his plays or his most passionate love-poems, we shall find all frozen and made rigid with intellect."<ref>Charles Lamb, ''Rosamund Gray, Essays, Letters, and Poems'' (New York, 1859), p. 552.</ref> He goes on to speak of the obscurity of expression that runs through all Greville's poetry.

Andrea McCrea sees the influence of [[Justus Lipsius]] in the ''Letter to an Honourable Lady'', but elsewhere detects a scepticism more akin to [[Michel de Montaigne]].<ref>Adriana McCrea, ''Constant Minds: Political virtue and the Lipsian paradigm in England, 1584-1650'' (1997), pp. 115-116.</ref>

A rhyming elegy on Greville, published in [[Henry Huth (bibliophile)|Henry Huth]]'s ''Inedited Poetical Miscellanies'', brings charges of miserliness against him.

[[Robert Pinsky]] has asserted that this work is comparable in force of imagination to [[John Donne]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Susan Orlean, David Remnick, Ethan Hawke, and Others Pick Their Favorite Obscure Books | date=2 December 2008 | publisher=[[The Village Voice]]| url =http://www.villagevoice.com/2008-12-03/books/susan-orlean-david-remnick-ethan-hawke-and-others-pick-their-favorite-obscure-books/}}</ref>

==Family==
Lord Brooke, who never married, left no natural heirs, and his senior (Brooke) barony passed to his cousin and adopted son, Robert Greville (1608–1643), who took the side of [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] in the [[English Civil War]], and defeated the [[Cavalier|Royalists]] in a skirmish at [[Kineton]] in August 1642. Robert was killed during the siege of [[Lichfield]] on 2 March 1643, having survived the elder Greville by only fifteen years. His other barony (Willoughby de Broke) was inherited by his sister [[Margaret Greville, 6th Baroness Willoughby de Broke|Margaret]] who married Sir Richard Verney.
