'''Maya Kaathryn Bohnhoff''' (born 1954) is an American sci-fi and fantasy author.

==Personal life==
Bohnhoff, mother of three, has been married since 1981 to Jeff Bohnhoff. The couple and their children are members of the [[Baháʼí Faith]].<ref name="filk">{{cite web|title=Interview with Jeff Bohnhoff |last=Ohi |first=Debbie Ridpath |url=http://www.electricpenguin.com/filking/articles/jeffbohnhoff.html |publisher=The Dandelion Report |access-date=2006-09-10 |date=March 2001 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904013524/http://www.electricpenguin.com/filking/articles/jeffbohnhoff.html |archive-date=2006-09-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://www.mysticfig.com/faith.htm Official Website statement of faith] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714144537/http://www.mysticfig.com/faith.htm |date=2011-07-14 }}</ref> She began her interest in [[science fiction]] after watching ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951 film)|The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'' as a child.<ref name="baens">[http://www.baens-universe.com/authors/Maya_Kaathryn_Bohnhoff Author biography],  [[Jim Baen's Universe]] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020100427/http://www.baens-universe.com/authors/Maya_Kaathryn_Bohnhoff |date=2007-10-20 }})</ref> Her mother was a singer and music was a predominant passion over writing, through her high school and college days.<ref name="mother" >{{cite book | last = Bohnhoff | first = Maya Kaathryn | editor = Michael Fritzgerald | editor-link = Michael Fritzgerald | title = The Creative Circle - Art, Literature and Music in Baháʼí Perspective | year = 1989 | publisher = Kalimat Press | location = Los Angeles | isbn = 0-933770-68-5 | pages = 39–49 | chapter = But My Mother Was a Singer }}</ref>

Over a decade after her high school experience of being pressured to choose between practical subjects and the arts of music and writing, Bohnhoff wrote an autobiographical essay "But My Mother Was a Singer"<ref name="mother" /> in which she chronicles her struggle with the question and argues that though the [[Baháʼí Faith and education|Baháʼí teachings]] include an emphasis on the importance of the arts and earning a livelihood by one's calling, "… using our cultural criteria, the arts may seem to have little to do with survival. But they have a tremendous amount to do with '' 'carrying forward an ever advancing civilization{{'}}''."  Eventually she held a [[day job]] as an Instructional Designer and Manager for [[Kelly Services]]<ref>[http://www.linkedin.com/pub/0/b68/2a Author page at Linkedin]</ref> for some years but bosses would either "urge me to give up music" or told her "You don't belong here" while co-workers would misunderstand the life of the artist — "'If you are any good, what are you doing working here?'" "Minor setbacks", Bohnhoff continues, "in my 'career' provided intensely embarrassing situations at work."

On the musical side the drive to do music "…took me through years of food stamps and rice cakes, the disappointment and frustration of losing band members and starting over…" as well as taking her through "… the inertia when playing 'wall paper' music …<nowiki>[and]</nowiki> the 'top&nbsp;40' club act". Along with such struggles is the [[Spirituality|spiritual]] one of purity of motive — "I, too, love applause, and to me the act of sharing music is more rewarding than writing it" and which genre of music was spiritual? She writes that at one point, eight months pregnant, she had an opportunity to work at [[Fantasy Studios]] in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] for "fifteen hour days" but learned that "…I was a musician and a writer by natural inclination, not a celebrity" and "found a deeper understanding of [[Baháʼu'lláh]]'s admonition to be independent of all save God." She resolves the conflict noting "Any musician who has heard a song come to life out of the weave of rhythm and melody, any writer who has ever created a set of characters, any painter who has laid brush to canvas, any sculptor who has ever been up to his elbows in clay or marble dust, any woman who has ever given birth to a child, any and all have experienced something central to understanding the love that motivated the First Creator." Bohnhoff writes using an [[Apple Inc.]] [[PowerBook]].<ref name="inky">[http://www.inkygirl.com/interview-maya-bohnhoff/ Inkygirl interview by Debbie Ridpath Ohi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928214648/http://www.inkygirl.com/interview-maya-bohnhoff/ |date=2007-09-28 }}</ref>

Bohnhoff is now a full-time writer, working alone and in collaboration with [[Michael Reaves]].

==Writing==

===Short writings===
Bohnhoff has written several dozen short stories and novelettes in most of the well known publishing magazines: [[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|''Analog'']] magazine, [[Interzone (magazine)]], ''[[Amazing Stories]], [[Realms of Fantasy]], [[Jim Baen's Universe]],'' and others. Many of them have a recognizable relationship to religions — several have a significant basis in relation to the [[Baháʼí Faith]] and a few use [[Pagan]] (''Spirit Gate''), [[Catholic]] (''Infinite Space, Infinite God''<ref>[http://www.twilighttimesbooks.com/InfiniteSpace_ss1.html Twighlight Times Books profile] "An anthology of fifteen stories about how the future Catholic Church uses--or fails to use--its faith, wisdom and imagination to grow with the changes of the future.</ref>), and [[Muslim]] (''The Sons of the Fathers''<ref>[http://www.wsfa.org/journal/j95/c2/index.htm Century #3, Reviewed by Steven desJardins] The ''WSFA Journal'' December 15, 1995, ISSN 0894-5411 Edited by Joe Mayhew</ref>) characters or situations.  Two brief examples include "Home is Where..."<ref name="adherents">[https://web.archive.org/web/20000818090609/http://www.adherents.com/lit/sf_bahai.html Baha'is in Science Fiction and Fantasy]</ref> in which a pair of time traveling historians from the future employ an unusual conflict resolution method when their homesick kids go on strike during a Cold War visit to a US Air Force Base, and "The White Dog" wherein a lady comes to terms with her shocking albino appearance through the allegorical totem used by [[ʻAbdu'l-Bahá]] — a little white dog.<ref>{{cite book | title = The White Dog |first = Maya Kaathryn |last = Bohnhoff | location = London | work = Interzone | year=1999 | url = http://bahai-library.com/bohnhoff_white_dog}}</ref> The story "The White Dog" was a finalist for the 1999 [[BSFA award]]. "Cruel and Unusual Punishment" was included in the [[E-book]] [[anthology]] ''Infinite Sky, Infinite God'' which won the 2007 [[E-book#E-book industry|EPPIE award]].<ref>[http://www.epicauthors.org/eppiewinners2007.html Winners of the EPPIE award for 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820100415/http://www.epicauthors.org/eppiewinners2007.html |date=2007-08-20 }}</ref> The story "O,&nbsp;Pioneer" was a finalist for the 2006 [[Sidewise Award for Alternate History]].

===Long writings===
In addition to her shorter works Bohnhoff has written several full-length novels which elaborate on her interests in examining/promoting feminist and religious concepts in science fiction, fantasy and related genres. Her best known novel may be ''The&nbsp;Meri'' which became a trilogy and has been published twice (1992 and 2005) and was a finalist for ''Locus'' magazine's 1993 award for Best First Novel<ref>[http://www.diversebooks.com/cgi-bin/ay.cgi?Lc1993 Voting Ballot for Analog Awards, 1993] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927001611/http://www.diversebooks.com/cgi-bin/ay.cgi?Lc1993 |date=2007-09-27 }}</ref> Bohnhoff has worked with internet development of online content with her editorship of ''Hackoff.com'' — a [[blook]] by [[Tom Evslin]]. In 2018 Pegasus Books published ''The Antiquities Hunter: A Gina Miyoko Mystery'', the first in a series of private detective novels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pegasusbooks.com/books/the-antiquities-hunter-9781681778570-hardcover|title=The Antiquities Hunter|website=pegasusbooks.com|access-date=2018-10-02}}</ref>

===Feminist and religious themes===
''The Meri'' series revolves around the period of transition among the people who live on a peninsula. The chapters are headed with quotes from scripture presented as those of the religion of the people but many are in fact quotes from [[Baháʼí literature|Baháʼí scripture]], the [[Bhagavad Gita]], the [[Upanishads]], the [[Dhammapada]] and other Buddhist sacred texts, the [[Qurʼan]] and the [[Bible]]. The first and second book also carry an acknowledgement of [[Baháʼu'lláh]], a [[Local Spiritual Assembly]] and Baháʼí community.<ref name="kuhner">[http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.sf.reviews/browse_thread/thread/86ccf9f67e015109/ed51f50cef50c62a?lnk=gst&q=maya+bohnhoff+&rnum=1#ed51f50cef50c62a _The Meri_ and _Taminy_ by Maya Kaathryn Bohnhoff] a book review by Mary K. Kuhner</ref>  The plot involves a progression on the understanding of a people in relation to the role and position of women. Unknown to the people of the story, women have always been instrumental to their religion as agents of [[God]] and a chosen few have always acted as the personification of the Spirit of God, or "Meri".<ref name="kuhner" />  The first book focuses on a young girl destined to take on that role. While similar to other stories of the triumph of women it has several unique qualities most particularly a central male character being her benefactor and teacher and not an obstacle she has to overcome. The second book focuses on the return of the prior "Meri" who takes it as her mission as the head of the renewed religion to promulgate the new paradigm of the role of women. The third book focuses on her transition to being a head of state but wrestling with several of the same issues from among as well as beyond her people. Another novel she has written called ''The Spirit Gate'' has many of the same features but is written in a different context — a fantasy work set in a historical time and place of roughly AD&nbsp;1000 in the area today of Poland and Ukraine where two forms of [[Christianity]] (Eastern Orthodox and Catholic) and [[Islam]] met the pagan older religion. Baháʼí themes, especially in the respect granted other religions, are largely identified with the older religion. Several of these themes are also in Bohnhoff's shorter writings — "Infinite Sky, Infinite God" highlights a [[Catholic]] future. Several short stories center on women — like "The Doctor's Wife" and "The White Dog" and both have reference to a religion. Reprints of some of Bohnhoff's works containing references to Baha'i themes are collected in the Juxta Press release, _I Loved Thy Creation_.

==Professional advancement==
Bohnhoff has worked in a number of venues to contribute to the field of authorship and relevance of Science Fiction and Fantasy at SciFi/Fa Conventions. She has participated in and moderated panel discussions for over a decade. She participates in the Museitup online writers conference and the Catholic Writers' Conference, and is a founding member and regular blogger at the Book View Café,<ref>[http://www.bookviewcafe.com Book View Café]</ref> a fiction website created by a cooperative of over 20 professional genre writers as an alternative publishing venture.

==Music==
Though Bohnhoff's interest in music as a career stretches back to her high school years<ref name="mother" /> and her mother, her avocation as a musician was started by 1980 when she was a member of a band called "Talisman"<ref name="filk" /> playing a mix of original [[progressive rock]] and [[top 40]] and got some airtime on [[KZAP (defunct)|KZAP]], a radio station in [[Sacramento, California]]. The Bonhoffs later reformed as part the band "Syntax" through which they released a cassette tape "Silent Planet" in 1990 — "Syntax" using a substantial amount of [[MIDI]] based music. They were introduced to [[filk]] music in 1991 and predominantly use [[acoustic guitars]] in their live shows. In 1991 the Bohnhoffs had been invited to a science fiction convention for Maya's "Hand-me Down Town" publication in Analog magazine because Maya was up for the [[Nebula Award]]. At a party for the event Jeff had the opportunity to a [[jam session]] with founding filk musicians [[Dr. Jane Robinson]], [[Cynthia McQuillin]] and [[Elizabeth Ann Scarborough]].<ref name="filk" /> After other conventions mostly for Maya's writing, Jeff and Maya were spontaneously invited to play music at the 1995 [[Baycon]] by [[Kathy Mar]]. It was after a long evening of music that they wrote "Knights in White Satin". Filk and parody have become their main musical presence, though now they perform through their own production company, MysticFig and as a duo predominantly.

Mrs. and Mr. Bohnhoff have given concerts at various science fiction conventions and conference for many years and have won awards doing so.
