== Biography ==

Scott O'Dell was born '''O'Dell Gabriel Scott''', but after his name was incorrectly published on a book as "Scott O'Dell", he decided to keep the name. He was born on [[Terminal Island]] in [[Los Angeles, California]], to parents May Elizabeth Gabriel and Bennett Mason Scott. He attended multiple colleges, including [[Occidental College]] in 1919, the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in 1920, [[Stanford University]] in 1921, and the [[Sapienza University of Rome]] in 1925. During World War II, he served in the [[United States Army Air Forces]]. Before becoming a full-time writer, he was employed as a cameraman and technical director, as a book columnist for the ''[[Los Angeles Mirror]]'', and as book review editor for the ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]''. He was married two times. His wives were Jane Dorsa Rattenbury, and Elizabeth Hall.

In 1934, O'Dell began writing articles as well as fiction and nonfiction books for adults. In the late 1950s, he began writing children's books.  His first children's book was ''Island of the Blue Dolphins''.

In 1984, he established the [[Scott O'Dell Award for Historical Fiction]], an award of $5,000 that recognizes outstanding works of historical fiction.  The winners must be published in English by a U.S. publisher and be set in the New World (North, Central, and South America).  In 1986, ''[[The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books]]'' awarded O'Dell this same award.<ref name=Award/>

Scott O'Dell died of [[prostate cancer]] on October 15, 1989 at the age of 91.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE2D91730F934A25753C1A96F948260 |date= October 17, 1989 |access-date= 2008-04-10 |title=Scott O'Dell, a Children's Author Of Historical Fiction, Dies at 91 |newspaper=The New York Times | first=Edwin | last=McDowell}}</ref>

==Film adaptations==

There have been several [[film adaptations]] of O'Dell's work.  ''Island of the Blue Dolphins'' has been translated into a number of languages and was made into a movie in 1964, starring [[Celia Kaye]], Larry Domasin, Ann Daniel, and [[George Kennedy (actor)|George Kennedy]]. In 1978, [[Saul Swimmer]] produced and directed a film version of ''The Black Pearl'' with Gilbert Roland and Mario Custodio.
