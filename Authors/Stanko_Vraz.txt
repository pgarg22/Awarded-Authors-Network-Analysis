'''Stanko Vraz''' (born '''Jakob Frass'''; 30 June 1810 – 20 May 1851) was a [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]]-[[Croatian language|Croatian]] poet. He Slavicized his name to ''Stanko Vraz'' in 1836.

==Biography==
Born in the village of [[Cerovec Stanka Vraza|Cerovec]] in [[Lower Styria]], [[Austrian Empire]] (today in [[Slovenia]]), Vraz was one of the most important figures of the [[Illyrian Movement]] in the [[Kingdom of Croatia and Slavonia]].<ref>Baynes,Thomas Spencer. ''The Encyclopædia Britannica''. Vol. 21.</ref> He was the first Croatian to earn his living as a professional writer. He wrote poems and travelogues and collected folk poems. He also translated foreign literature into [[Croatian language|Croatian]].

While in [[Samobor]], he met Julijana "Ljubica" Cantilly, the niece of his friend and colleague, [[Ljudevit Gaj]].<ref>Stančić, Nikša.

In 1842, he and two of his other contributors founded ''[[Kolo (magazine)|Kolo]]'', one of Croatia's first literary magazines.<ref>Kann, Robert A. ''A History of the Habsburg Empire, 1526–1918''. Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1974.</ref> The magazine, as well as his works, were influenced by [[national romanticism]].

Regarding the [[Slovene language]], Vraz's most notable work is the work ''Narodne pesmi ilirske, koje se pevaju po Štajerskoj, Kranjskoj, Koruškoj i zapadnoj strani Ugarske'' (Illyrian Folk Songs Sung in [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]], [[Carniola]], [[Carinthia (duchy)|Carinthia]] and the Western Part of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]]). It contains folk songs and art songs in Slovene, accompanied by comments in Croatian. These songs are the first Slovene texts in [[Gaj's Latin Alphabet]]. This orthography was already used at the time by [[Croats]] and spread among Slovenes a few years later. Vraz created numerous poems in Slovene but for the most part they have never been published.

He also translated works of [[Lord Byron]] and [[Adam Mickiewicz]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pomurski-muzej.si/izobrazevanje/gradiva-pomurja/gradivo/prevajalci |title=Prevajalci Pomurja in Porabja |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The Translators of the Mura Region and the Raba Valley |publisher=Murska Sobota Regional Museum |first=Franc |last=Kuzmič |date=22 March 2012}}</ref>
