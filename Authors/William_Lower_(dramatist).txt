'''Sir William Lower''' (c.1610–1662)<ref name="odnb"/> was an English dramatist and translator, and an officer in the King's army in the civil war.

==Life==
Lower was born in [[Cornwall]] about 1610, the only son of John Lower of Tremere and his first wife Jane. He did not attend [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] or [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], but "spent some time in Oxon in the condition of an Hospes, for the sake of the public Library and Scholastic Company", as his cousin [[Richard Lower (physician)|Richard Lower]], a physician, informed [[Anthony Wood (antiquary)|Anthony Wood]]. "... he troubled himself not with the crabb'd studies of Logic and Philosophy", travelled in France, and became a "perfect master of the French tongue".<ref name="odnb">{{cite ODNB|first=David|last=Kathman|id=17094|title=Lower, Sir William}}</ref><ref name="dnb00">{{cite DNB|first=Thomas|last=Seccombe|authorlink=Thomas Seccombe|wstitle=Lower, William|volume=34|pages=205–206}}</ref>

In 1639 he published ''The Phoenix in her Flames: a Tragedy'', dedicated to his cousin William Lower. [[John Genest]], in ''Some Account of the English Stage'' (volume 10, page 69), gives an abstract of the plot, which he describes as "romantic, but interesting".<ref name="dnb00"/>

===The civil war===
Lower was a lieutenant in [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Sir Jacob Ashley]]'s regiment in the King's army, and was promoted captain, but lost his company, which proved mutinous and deserted. In June 1644, being then lieutenant-governor of [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]], he received orders from the King to raise £50 a week from the town of [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] for the garrison at Wallingford. Lower took the mayor to Wallingford as a hostage; he then plied the corporation with diplomatic letters, which failed, however, to extract from them more than a fraction of the sum required. His zeal was subsequently rewarded by a knighthood, conferred upon him probably on 27 March 1645.<ref name="dnb00"/>

On 19 January 1646 he was taken prisoner by the parliamentary garrison of [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire|Abingdon]] and taken to London; he was released on 11 January 1647.<ref name="odnb"/>

===In Cologne and Holland===
He is thought to have remained in England until 1655, when he visited [[Cologne]], and cheered the royalists there with the assurance that Cromwell could not live long. Leaving Cologne after a short residence, he seems to have held some post in the household of the [[Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange|Princess Royal of Orange]] at [[the Hague]], and occupied his time in translating French plays.<ref name="dnb00"/>

In 1658 he published at the Hague another original play, ''The Enchanted Lovers: a Pastoral''. In 1660, during the negotiations between Charles II and the English parliament, Lower prepared his sumptuous "Relation in the form of a Journal of the Voiage and Residence which the most mighty and excellent Prince Charles II … hath made in Holland from 25 May to 2 June 1660, rendered into English out of the Original French." The work, a thin royal folio, was issued in September (in Dutch and French, as well as English), by Adrian Ulack of the Hague. The plates contain some two hundred portraits, both foreign and English.<ref name="dnb00"/>

===Return to England===
In June 1660 Lower wrote to [[Edward Nicholas]], Secretary of State to Charles II, from the Hague, asking for a place in the King's service. The death of his cousin Thomas Lower, by which he became sole heir, executor, and chief representative of the family, recalled him to England in 1661. He died early in the following year, his will being proved on 7 May 1662.<ref name="dnb00"/> His wife, of whom nothing is known, predeceased him; he left most of his estate to his daughter Elizabeth, held in trust until the age of 21.<ref name="odnb"/>

Lower was buried, Anthony Wood believed, in the church of [[St Clement Danes]] in Westminster, though there is no record of his interment either there or at [[St Winnow]] or at [[Landulph]], where his inherited estate was situate.<ref name="dnb00"/>

==Works==
[[Thomas Seccombe]], in the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'', wrote, "Though there are a few good lines in ''The Phoenix'', most of Lower's verse is very commonplace, and his translations, without being even laborious, are dull." Richard Lower described him to Anthony Wood as "an ill poet, and a worse man."<ref name="dnb00"/>
