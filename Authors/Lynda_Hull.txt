==Literary influences and praise==
In his review of her ''Collected Poems,'' Craig Morgan Teicher described Hull's poetry as, "lush, intensely lyrical evocations of the underbelly of American urban life, driven by a sense of inevitable loss and degradation but also by a powerful attachment to momentary beauty."<ref>[http://www.believermag.com/issues/200703/?read=review_hull ''The Believer'' > March 2007 > Craig Morgan Teicher: ''A Review of Collected Poems By Lynda Hull'']</ref> In a 2008 interview with ''Gulf Coast,'' [[David Wojahn]] said of her study and work, "She steeped herself in the Romantics, especially Keats and Shelley, and she knew Hart Crane almost by heart. I'm still in awe of that acuity, and of how she used it to do honor to a broken world, post-apocalyptic, filled with ruins and ruined lives. And she gave such dignity to that landscape and those lives. She really did have an incredible lyric gift, one that no other poet of my generation possessed."<ref>[http://www.gulfcoastmag.org/index.php?n=2&s=934 ''Gulf Coast: A Journal of Literature and Fine Arts'' > ''How Do You Bottle the Lightning? Anna Journey sits down with David Wojahn'']</ref> Poet [[David St. John]] wrote that "Of all the poets of my generation, Lynda Hull remains the most heartbreaking, merciful, and consoling."<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0060951125 Amazon.com > ''The Only World'' > Lynda Hull]</ref>
