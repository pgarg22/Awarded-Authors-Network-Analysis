'''Rodney Ackland''' (18 May 1908 in [[Westcliff-on-Sea]], Essex – 6 December 1991 in [[Richmond upon Thames]], Surrey) was an English [[playwright]], [[actor]], [[theatre director]] and [[screenwriter]].

Born as '''Norman Ackland Bernstein''' in [[Southend]], [[Essex]], to a [[Jewish]] father from [[Warsaw]] and a non-Jewish mother,<ref>William D. Rubinstein, Michael Jolles, Hilary L. Rubinstein, ''The Palgrave Dictionary of Anglo-Jewish History'', Palgrave Macmillan (2011), p. 13</ref> he was educated at [[Balham]] Grammar School in London. In his 16th year he made his first stage appearance at the [[Gate Theatre Studio]], playing Medvedieff in [[Maxim Gorky|Gorky's]] ''[[The Lower Depths]]'' and later studied acting at the [[Central School of Speech and Drama|Central School of Speech Training and Dramatic Art]]. He married [[Mab Lonsdale]], daughter of the playwright [[Frederick Lonsdale]], in 1952; she died in 1972.

==Theatre career==
In 1929, after performing with various repertory companies, he toured as Young Woodley in the [[Young Woodley (play)|play of that name]]. At the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] in 1933 he played Paul in his own adaptation of ''Ballerina'', which also toured the following year, and at the [[Criterion Theatre|Criterion]] in 1936 he played the role of Oliver Nashwick in his own original play ''[[After October]]'' which transferred there from the [[Arts Theatre]].

In 1941, he co-wrote the screenplay for the film ''[[Temptation Harbour]]'' starring [[Robert Newton]] and [[Simone Simon]]. Two musical collaborations came in 1942 with his version of ''[[Blossom Time]]'' starring [[Richard Tauber]] as [[Franz Schubert]] at the [[Lyric Theatre (London)|Lyric Theatre]], and his [[London Coliseum]] production of the musical play, ''[[The Belle of New York (musical)|The Belle of New York]]''. He also wrote and directed ''The Dark River'' at the [[Whitehall Theatre]] in 1943, starring [[Peggy Ashcroft]]. He joined [[Robert Newton]] as co-authors of ''Cupid and Mars'' (1945), and ''A Multitude of Sins'' (1951)

The first staging of his large-cast drama, ''The Pink Room'' (or ''The Escapists''), in Brighton and then at the [[Lyric Hammersmith]] in London on 18 June 1952, was largely financed by [[Terence Rattigan]], who liked the play and believed it deserved a London production. ''The Pink Room'' was a tragi-comedy set in the summer of 1945 in a seedy London club (based on the French Club in Soho).<ref>The Oxford Companion to English Literature, 6th Edition. Edited by Margaret Drabble, Oxford University Press, 2000 Pp 4</ref> It received a severe critical panning and after that, apart from one further play and an adaptation, it led to the playwright's more than 30-year virtual absence. According to its director, [[Frith Banbury]], "When the play failed, Terry never wanted to see Rodney again."

However, following the abolition of the [[Lord Chamberlain]]'s play licensing in 1968, Ackland was able to write rewrote aspects of this play, re-titling it ''[[Absolute Hell]]''. It was performed in its new form in 1988 to considerable success at the [[Orange Tree Theatre]], Richmond-upon-Thames, directed by [[Sam Walters]] and [[John Gardyne]], and starring [[Polly Hemingway]] and [[David Rintoul]].

In 1991, it was adapted and directed for [[BBC Two|BBC 2]] by [[Anthony Page]], starring Dame [[Judi Dench]]. The play was revived by Page at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] in 1995, again with Dench in the leading role. In 2018, the National staged another revival, directed by [[Joe Hill-Gibbins]] and starring [[Kate Fleetwood]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/apr/26/absolute-hell-review-lyttelton-national-theatre-london|title=Absolute Hell review – postwar Soho gets a Weimar makeover|first=Michael|last=Billington|date=26 April 2018|work=The Guardian}}</ref>

==Film career==
Rodney Ackland's first contact with [[Alfred Hitchcock]] was as a supporting actor in ''[[The Skin Game (1931 film)|The Skin Game]]'' (1931), a screen version]] of the [[John Galsworthy]] play.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dvxkR0spGUMC&q=the+skin+game+rodney+ackland&pg=PT98|title=Hitch: The Life and Times of Alfred Hitchcock|first=John Russell|last=Taylor|date=16 April 2013|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=9781448211616|via=Google Books}}</ref> Hitchcock, however, recognised his potential as a screenwriter and collaborating with him on the second film adaptation of [[Joseph Jefferson Farjeon|J Jefferson Farjeon]]'s London fog-bound thriller ''[[Number Seventeen]]'' (1932) starring [[Leon M. Lion]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmovie.com/movie/number-seventeen-v35810/cast-crew|title=Number Seventeen (1932) - Alfred Hitchcock &#124; Cast and Crew|website=AllMovie}}</ref>

Ackland co-wrote the British film  ''[[Bank Holiday (film)|Bank Holiday]]'' (1938), contributed additional dialogue to ''[[Young Man's Fancy (film)|Young Man's Fancy]]'' (1940), and made some uncredited contributions to ''[[Dangerous Moonlight]]'' (1941) and ''[[Love Story (1944 film)|Love Story]]'' (1944).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b9f2ba420|title=Rodney Ackland|website=BFI}}</ref> His screenplay for ''[[Hatter's Castle (film)|Hatter's Castle]]'' (1942), from the novel by [[A.J. Cronin]], provided a rampant star role for Robert Newton as the megalomaniac Scottish hatter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmovie.com/movie/hatters-castle-v94411/cast-crew|title=Hatter's Castle (1941) - Lance Comfort &#124; Cast and Crew|website=AllMovie}}</ref> He shared with [[Emeric Pressburger]] an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for the [[screenplay]] of ''[[49th Parallel (film)|49th Parallel]]'' (US: ''The Invaders'', 1941), starring [[Raymond Massey]] and [[Eric Portman]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmovie.com/movie/49th-parallel-v60046/awards|title=49th Parallel (1941) - Emeric Pressburger, Michael Powell &#124; Awards|website=AllMovie}}</ref>

Ackland is credited with discovering the actress [[Sally Ann Howes]], the child of neighbour [[Bobby Howes]], when he insisted that she audition for his film ''[[Thursday's Child (1943 film)|Thursday's Child]]'' (1943), which he both wrote and directed.

He renewed his association with Pressburger with the two men co-writing the screenplay for the thriller ''[[Wanted for Murder (film)|Wanted for Murder]]'' (1946), mainly intended as a film vehicle for Eric Portman playing a man obsessed by his father's role as the public hangman. Around the same time, he made ''[[Temptation Harbour]]'' (1947), the first adaptation]] of [[Georges Simenon]]'s novel ''[[Newhaven/Dieppe]]'', directed by [[Lance Comfort]], again with Robert Newton.

He twice collaborated with Rattigan as a screenwriter, on the [[Anthony Asquith]] film ''[[Uncensored (film)|Uncensored]]'' (1942), starring Eric Portman; and for the [[Associated British]] production of ''[[Bond Street (film)|Bond Street]]'' (1948), an anthology film consisting of four stories about a wedding trousseau. Neither Ackland nor Rattigan were credited on the latter film.

His final work for the cinema was on the screenplay for ''[[The Queen of Spades (1949 film)|The Queen of Spades]]'' (1949), an adaptation of [[Alexander Pushkin]]'s short story. Ackland intended to direct the film, but fell out with the producer [[Anatole de Grunwald]] and star [[Anton Walbrook]]. [[Thorold Dickinson]] took over at short notice and rewrote Ackland's script with the help of de Grunwald.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Sinyard|first=Neil|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/452329/|title=Queen of Spades, The (1949)|work=BFI Screenonline|date=2003–14|access-date=27 January 2021}}</ref>

Assisted by a co-author [[Elspeth Grant]], Ackland wrote his memoirs, ''[[The Celluloid Mistress]], or The Custard Pie of Dr. Caligari'', published by Alan Wingate in London in 1954.
