'''Lucien Descaves''' (18 March 1861 – 6 September 1949) was a [[French people|French]] [[novelist]].

Descaves was born in [[Paris]]. A disciple of [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]] and the [[Goncourt brothers]], his novels ''Le Calvaire d'Héloïse Pajadou'' (1883) and ''Une vieille rate'' (1883) followed strongly the [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]] movement.

The anti-military novel, ''Sous-Offs'' (1889) provoked a scandal. Though acquitted of charges of offending the army and public morality, Descaves was stripped of his military rank.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Calligrammes: Poems de la Paix et de la Guerre, 1913-1916. par APOLLINAIRE, Guillaume.: (1918) Signed by Author(s) {{!}} Shapero Rare Books|url=https://www.abebooks.fr/edition-originale-signee/Calligrammes-Poems-Paix-Guerre-1913-1916-APOLLINAIRE/30718612089/bd|access-date=2021-05-28|website=www.abebooks.fr|language=fr}}</ref>
