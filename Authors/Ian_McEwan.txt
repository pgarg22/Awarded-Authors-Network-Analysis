'''Ian Russell McEwan''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|sep=,|CBE|FRSA|FRSL}} (born 21 June 1948) is an English [[novelist]] and [[screenwriter]]. In 2008, ''[[The Times]]'' featured him on its list of "The 50 greatest British writers since 1945" and ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' ranked him number 19 in its list of the "100 most powerful people in [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British culture]]".<ref>{{cite news |title=The 100 most powerful people in British culture |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3672604/The-100-most-powerful-people-in-British-culture-1-20.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=9 November 2016}}</ref>

McEwan began his career writing sparse, [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] [[short stories]]. His first two novels, ''[[The Cement Garden]]'' (1978) and ''[[The Comfort of Strangers]]'' (1981), earned him the nickname "Ian Macabre". These were followed by three novels of some success in the 1980s and early 1990s. His novel ''[[Enduring Love]]'' was adapted into [[Enduring Love (film)|a film of the same name]]. He won the [[Man Booker Prize|Booker Prize]] with ''[[Amsterdam (novel)|Amsterdam]]'' (1998). His next novel, ''[[Atonement (novel)|Atonement]]'', garnered acclaim and was adapted into an [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning [[Atonement (2007 film)|film]] featuring [[Keira Knightley]] and [[James McAvoy]]. His later novels have included ''[[The Children Act (novel)|The Children Act]]'', ''[[Nutshell (novel)|Nutshell]]'', and ''[[Machines Like Me]]''. He was awarded the 1999 [[Shakespeare Prize]], and the 2011 [[Jerusalem Prize]].

==Early life==
McEwan was born in [[Aldershot]], [[Hampshire]], on 21 June 1948, the son of David McEwan and Rose Lilian Violet (''[[née]]'' Moore).<ref name=filmr>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/14/Ian-McEwan.html |title=Ian McEwan |publisher=Film reference |access-date=26 August 2011}}</ref> His father was a working-class [[Scotland|Scotsman]] who had worked his way up through the army to the rank of major.<ref>{{cite news |last=Cooke |first=Rachel |title=Ian McEwan: 'I had the time of my life' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/19/ian-mcewan-sweet-tooth-interview |newspaper=The Guardian |date=19 August 2012}}</ref>

McEwan spent much of his childhood in [[east Asia]] (including [[Singapore]]), [[Germany]], and [[north Africa]] (including [[Libya]]), where his father was posted. His family returned to England when he was 12 years old. He was educated at [[Woolverstone Hall School]] in Suffolk; the [[University of Sussex]], where he received a degree in English literature in 1970; and the [[University of East Anglia]], where he undertook a master's degree in literature (with the option to submit creative writing instead of a critical dissertation).<ref>Jaillant, Lise.

==Career==

=== Early career: short stories and 'Ian Macabre' phase, 1975–1987 ===
McEwan's first published work was a collection of short stories, ''[[First Love, Last Rites]]'' (1975), which won the [[Somerset Maugham Award]] in 1976. He achieved notoriety in 1979 when the BBC suspended production of his play ''Solid Geometry'' because of its supposed obscenity.<ref>''Ian McEwan: Writers and Their Work'' by Kiernan Ryan publ 1994</ref> His second collection of short stories, ''[[In Between the Sheets]]'', was published in 1978. ''[[The Cement Garden]]'' (1978) and ''[[The Comfort of Strangers]]'' (1981), his two earliest novels, [[The Comfort of Strangers (film)|were both]] adapted into films. The nature of these works caused him to be nicknamed "Ian Macabre".<ref name="Independent">{{cite news |last=Walsh |first=John |title=Ian McEwan: Here's the twist |work=The Independent |date=27 January 2007 |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/people/profiles/article2169220.ece |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070121183848/http://news.independent.co.uk/people/profiles/article2169220.ece |url-status=dead |archive-date=21 January 2007 |access-date=22 March 2007 |location=London}}</ref> These were followed by his first book for children, ''Rose Blanche'' (1985), and a return to literary fiction with ''[[The Child in Time]]'' (1987), winner of the [[1987 Whitbread Awards|1987 Whitbread Novel Award]].

=== Mid-career: mainstream success and Booker Prize win, 1988–2007 ===
After ''The Child in Time'', McEwan began to move away from the darker, more unsettling material of his earlier career and towards the style that would see him reach a wider readership and gain significant critical acclaim. This new phase began with the publication of the mid-[[Cold War]] espionage drama ''[[The Innocent (McEwan novel)|The Innocent]]'' (1990), and ''[[Black Dogs]]'' (1992), a quasi-companion piece reflecting on the aftermath of the Nazi era in Europe and the end of the Cold War. McEwan followed these works with his second book for children, ''The Daydreamer'' (1994).

His 1997 novel, ''[[Enduring Love]]'', about the relationship between a science writer and a stalker, was popular with critics, although it was not shortlisted for the [[Man Booker Prize|Booker Prize]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Knorr |first=Katherine |title=Enduring Love |work=International Herald Tribune |date=9 October 1997 |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/1997/10/09/bookjeu.t.php |access-date=22 March 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080330020341/http://www.iht.com/articles/1997/10/09/bookjeu.t.php |archive-date=2008-03-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Ian McEwan's Family Values |work=Boston Review |url=https://bostonreview.net/BR31.1/boylan.html |access-date=21 March 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002002553/http://www.bostonreview.net/BR31.1/boylan.html |archive-date=2 October 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It was adapted into [[Enduring Love (film)|a film]] in 2004. In 1998, he won the [[Man Booker Prize|Booker Prize]] for ''[[Amsterdam (novel)|Amsterdam]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.themanbookerprize.com/prize/archive/31 |publisher=[[Man Booker Prize]] |title=Prize archive: 1998 |access-date=7 July 2010}}</ref> His next novel, ''[[Atonement (novel)|Atonement]]'' (2001), received considerable acclaim; ''Time'' magazine named it the best novel of 2002, and it was shortlisted for the Booker Prize.<ref>[http://www.themanbookerprize.com/prize/archive/34 Man Booker Prize Website] Retrieved 13 April 2010</ref> In 2007, the critically acclaimed film [[Atonement (2007 film)|''Atonement'']], directed by Joe Wright and starring Keira Knightley and James McAvoy, was released in cinemas worldwide. His next work, ''[[Saturday (novel)|Saturday]]'' (2005), follows an especially eventful day in the life of a successful [[neurosurgery|neurosurgeon]]. ''Saturday'' won the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for 2005. His novel ''[[On Chesil Beach]]'' (2007) was shortlisted for the 2007 Man Booker Prize and was adapted into a film starring [[Saoirse Ronan]] in [[On Chesil Beach (film)|2017]], for which McEwan wrote the screenplay. McEwan has also written a number of produced screenplays, a stage play, children's fiction, and an [[oratorio]] and a libretto titled ''For You'' with music composed by [[Michael Berkeley]].

In 2006, McEwan was accused of plagiarism; specifically that a passage in ''Atonement'' (2001) closely echoed a passage from a memoir, ''No Time for Romance'', published in 1977 by [[Lucilla Andrews]]. McEwan acknowledged using the book as a source for his work.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/28/books/28aton.html |work=The New York Times |first=Alan |last=Cowell |title=Eyebrows Are Raised Over Passages in a Best Seller by Ian McEwan |date=28 November 2006}}</ref> McEwan had included a brief note at the end of ''Atonement'', referring to Andrews's autobiography, among several other works. The incident recalled critical controversy over his debut novel ''[[The Cement Garden]]'', key elements of the plot of which closely mirrored some of those of ''[[Our Mother's House]]'', a 1963 novel by British author [[Julian Gloag]], which had also been made into a film. McEwan denied charges of plagiarism, claiming he was unaware of the earlier work.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/28/books/28aton.html |work=The New York Times |title=Eyebrows Are Raised Over Passages in a Best Seller by Ian McEwan |author=Alan Cowell |date=28 November 2006 |access-date=7 July 2010}}</ref> Writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'' in November 2006, a month after Andrews' death, McEwan professed innocence of plagiarism while acknowledging his debt to the author of ''No Time for Romance''.<ref name="Guardian">{{cite news |title=An inspiration, yes.

=== Later career: political works and continued success, 2008–present ===
McEwan's first novel of the 2010s, ''[[Solar (novel)|Solar]]'', was published by Jonathan Cape and Doubleday in March 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ianmcewan.com/bib/books/solar.html |title=Solar |publisher=Ian Mcewan's Website |access-date=26 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825073237/http://www.ianmcewan.com/bib/books/solar.html |archive-date=25 August 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> In June 2008 at the Hay Festival, McEwan gave a surprise reading of this work-in-progress. The novel includes "a scientist who hopes to save the planet"<ref name="guardian.co.uk">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jun/02/hayfestival2008.hayfestival |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=McEwan sees funny side of climate change in novel reading |date=2 June 2008 |access-date=2 April 2010 |first=Judith |last=Soal}}</ref> from the threat of climate change, with inspiration for the novel coming from a Cape Farewell expedition McEwan made in 2005 in which "artists and scientists...spent several weeks aboard a ship near the north pole discussing environmental concerns". McEwan noted "The novel's protagonist Michael Beard has been awarded a Nobel prize for his pioneering work on physics, and has discovered that winning the coveted prize has interfered with his work".<ref name="guardian.co.uk"/> He said that the work was not a comedy: "I hate comic novels; it's like being wrestled to the ground and being tickled, being forced to laugh",<ref name="guardian.co.uk"/> instead, that it had extended comic stretches.

''Solar'' was followed by McEwan's twelfth novel, ''[[Sweet Tooth (novel)|Sweet Tooth]]'', a [[meta-fictional]] [[historical novel]] set in the 1970s,<ref name="Farndale">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/authorinterviews/8359326/Ian-McEwan-interview.html# |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |first=Nigel |last=Farndale |title=Ian McEwan interview |date=7 March 2011}}</ref> and was published in late August 2012.<ref>[http://ianmcewan.com/bib/books/sweettooth.html "Sweet Tooth"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503084444/http://www.ianmcewan.com/bib/books/sweettooth.html |date=3 May 2012}}, at IanMcEwan.com.</ref> In an interview with ''[[The Scotsman]]'' newspaper to coincide with publication, McEwan revealed that the impetus for writing ''Sweet Tooth'' had been "[...] a way in which I can write a disguised autobiography".<ref>{{Cite web|title=In the line of fire SFA hands Davis Scottish Cup final role|url=https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/line-fire-sfa-hands-davis-scottish-cup-final-role-2474675|access-date=2021-05-19|website=www.scotsman.com|language=en}}</ref> He revealed in an interview with ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', in November 2012, that the film rights to ''Sweet Tooth'' had been bought by [[Working Title Films]] – the company that had adapted ''Atonement'' as a film.<ref>{{cite news |last=Chai |first=Barbara |title=Working Title Secures Film Rights to Ian McEwan's New Novel, 'Sweet Tooth'|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2012/10/27/working-title-options-ian-mcewans-new-novel-sweet-tooth/ |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=27 October 2012}}</ref> ''Sweet Tooth'' was followed two years later by ''[[The Children Act (novel)|The Children Act]]'', which concerned [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] judges, UK family law, and the right to die.<ref>{{cite news |last=Stock |first=Jon |title=Ian McEwan: John le Carré deserves Booker |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/10033653/Ian-McEwan-John-le-Carre-deserves-Booker.html |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=3 May 2013}}</ref>

Two years after ''The Children Act'', McEwan's 2016 novel ''[[Nutshell (novel)|Nutshell]]'', a short novel closer in style and tone to his earlier works, was published. McEwan's next work, a short novella, was titled ''My Purple Scented Novel'' – part of which was published previously as a short story by the same title in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' in 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/03/28/my-purple-scented-novel-fiction-by-ian-mcewan |title=My Purple Scented Novel |first=Ian |last=McEwan |date=21 March 2016 |access-date=28 March 2018 |via=www.newyorker.com}}</ref> This short work was published to mark McEwan's 70th birthday in June 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1116485/my-purple-scented-novel/ |title=My Purple Scented Novel by Ian McEwan |website=www.penguin.co.uk |access-date=28 March 2018}}</ref>

McEwan followed ''Nutshell'' in April 2019 with the alternate history/science fiction novel ''Machines Like Me''. It concerns [[artificial intelligence]] and an alternate history in which Great Britain loses the [[Falklands War]] and the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], led by [[Tony Benn]], eventually wins the 1987 General Election. In September 2019, McEwan announced a quick surprise follow-up novella, ''The Cockroach''.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Cain|first=Sian|date=2019-09-12|title=Ian McEwan announces surprise Brexit satire, The Cockroach|url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/12/ian-mcewan-announces-surprise-brexit-satire-the-cockroach|access-date=2021-05-19|website=The Guardian|language=en}}</ref>

In 2006, the Board of Trustees of the Kenyon Review honored McEwan with the [https://www.kenyonreview.org/programs/kenyon-review-award-for-literary-achievement/ian-mcewan/ Kenyon Review Award for Literary Achievement], writing that "McEwan's stories, novels, and plays are notable for their fierce artistic dramas, exploring unanticipated and often brutal collisions between the ordinary and the extraordinary".<ref>{{cite web |title=Kenyon Review for Literary Achievement |url=http://www.kenyonreview.org/programs/kenyon-review-award-for-literary-achievement/|website=KenyonReview.org}}</ref>

In 2012, the [[University of Sussex]] presented McEwan with its 50th Anniversary Gold Medal in recognition of his contributions to literature.<ref>[http://www.sussex.ac.uk/newsandevents/?id=14527 "Sussex awards gold medals to its world-leading alumni and past academics"], University of Sussex, News, 13 July 2012.</ref>

In 2014, the [[Harry Ransom Center]] at the University of Texas paid $2 million for McEwan's literary archives. The archives includes drafts of all of his later novels. McEwan commented that his novel ''Atonement'' started out as a science fiction story set "two or three centuries in the future".<ref>[http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/05/16/ransom-center-pays-2-million-for-ian-mcewan-papers/ "Ransom Center Pays $2 Million for Ian McEwan Papers"], ''The New York Times'', 16 May 2014.</ref>

In 2019, McEwan received the Golden Plate Award of the [[Academy of Achievement|American Academy of Achievement]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Golden Plate Awardees of the American Academy of Achievement |website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url=https://achievement.org/our-history/golden-plate-awards/}}</ref>

In 2020, McEwan was awarded the [[Goethe Medal]], a yearly prize given by the [[Goethe-Institut]] honouring non-Germans "who have performed outstanding service for the German language and for international cultural relations".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.goethe.de/en/uun/ver/gme/prt.html|title=Awardees - Goethe-Institut|website=www.goethe.de|access-date=2020-04-28}}</ref> According to the jury, McEwan's literary work ("Machines like us") is "imbued with the essence of contradiction and critical, depth-psychological reflection of social phenomena". Despite harsh attacks in his own country, the writer "openly defends himself against narrow-minded nationalisms" and appears as a passionate pro-European.

==Views on religion and politics==
[[File:Ianmcewan.jpg|thumb|right|200px]]

In 2008, McEwan publicly spoke out against [[Islamism]] for its [[Women and Islam|views on women]] and [[Homosexuality and Islam|on homosexuality]]. He was quoted as saying that [[Islamic fundamentalism|fundamentalist Islam]] wanted to create a society that he "abhorred". His comments appeared in the Italian newspaper ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', to defend fellow writer [[Martin Amis]] against allegations of racism. McEwan, an [[Atheism|atheist]],<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/magazine/02wwln-Q4-t.html |work=The New York Times |title=A Sinner's Tale |first=Deborah |last=Solomon |date=2 December 2007 |access-date=2 April 2010}}</ref> said that certain streams of Christianity were "equally absurd" and that he didn't "like these medieval visions of the world according to which God is coming to save the faithful and to damn the others".<ref>{{cite news |last=Popham |first=Peter |title='I despise Islamism': Ian McEwan faces backlash over press interview |work=The Independent |date=22 June 2008 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/i-despise-islamism-ian-mcewan-faces-backlash-over-press-interview-852030.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622221114/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/i-despise-islamism-ian-mcewan-faces-backlash-over-press-interview-852030.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=22 June 2008 |access-date=25 June 2008 |location=London}}</ref>

McEwan put forward the following statement on his official site and blog after claiming he was misinterpreted:
:Certain remarks of mine to an Italian journalist have been widely misrepresented in the UK press, and on various websites. Contrary to reports, my remarks were not about Islam, but about Islamism – perhaps 'extremism' would be a better term. I grew up in a Muslim country – Libya – and have only warm memories of a dignified, tolerant and hospitable Islamic culture. I was referring in my interview to a tiny minority who preach violent [[jihad]], who incite hatred and violence against 'infidels', [[apostate]]s, Jews and homosexuals; who in their speeches and on their websites speak passionately against free thought, [[Multiculturalism|pluralism]], democracy, [[hijab|unveiled women]]; who will tolerate no other interpretation of Islam but their own and have [[Takfir|vilified]] [[Sufism]] and other strands of Islam as [[apostasy]]; who have murdered, among others, fellow Muslims by the thousands in the market places of Iraq, Algeria and in the Sudan. Countless Islamic writers, journalists and religious authorities have expressed their disgust at this extremist violence. To speak against such things is hardly 'astonishing' on my part (''[[Independent on Sunday]]'') or original, nor is it '[[Islamophobia|Islamophobic]]' and 'right wing' as one official of the [[Muslim Council of Britain]] insists, and nor is it to endorse the failures and brutalities of [[Foreign policy of the United States|US foreign policy]]. It is merely to invoke a common humanity which I hope would be shared by all religions as well as all non-believers.'<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ian-mcewan.blogspot.com/2008_06_01_archive.html |publisher=ian-mcewan.blogspot.com |title=McEwan Addresses Recent Statement on Islamism |author=Ian McEwan |date=26 June 2008 |access-date=7 July 2010}}</ref>

In 2007, [[Christopher Hitchens]] dedicated his book ''[[God Is Not Great]]'' to McEwan.

In 2008, McEwan was among more than 200,000 signatories of a petition to support Italian journalist [[Roberto Saviano]] who received multiple death threats and was placed in police protection after exposing the [[Italian Mafia|Mafia]]-like [[crime syndicate]], [[Camorra]], in his 2006 book ''[[Gomorrah (book)|Gomorrah]]''. McEwan said he hoped the petition would help "galvanize" the Italian police into taking seriously the "fundamental matter of civil rights and free speech".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/oct/24/mcewan-mafia-saviano-extremists |title=Ian McEwan condemns 'thuggery' of Neapolitan mafia |last=Flood |first=Alison |date=24 October 2008 |work=The Guardian |location=UK |access-date=26 August 2011}}</ref>

McEwan also signed a petition to support the release of [[Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani]], an Iranian woman sentenced to death by stoning after being convicted of committing adultery.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/22/iran-stoning-woman-campaigners |title=Iran stoning case woman ordered to name campaigners |location=London |work=The Guardian |date=22 July 2010}}</ref>

On winning the [[Jerusalem Prize]], McEwan defended himself against criticism for accepting the prize in light of opposition to Israeli policies, saying: "If you didn't go to countries whose foreign policy or domestic policy is screwed up, you'd never get out of bed".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-people-mcewan-interview-idUKTRE71H48M20110218 |work=Reuters |title=Palestinian writers shun Ian McEwan over Israel honour |date=18 February 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Harriet Sherwood in Tel Aviv |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/feb/18/ian-mcewan-israel-book-award?INTCMP=SRCH |title=McEwan to accept Israeli book award but criticise occupation |work=The Guardian |location=UK |access-date=26 August 2011 |date=18 February 2011}}</ref> On accepting the honour he spoke in favour of Israel's existence, security, and freedoms,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rcwlitagency.com/news.aspx |title=RCW |publisher=Rcwlitagency.com |access-date=26 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829220232/http://www.rcwlitagency.com/news.aspx |archive-date=29 August 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> while strongly attacking Hamas, Israel's policies in Gaza, and the expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.smh.com.au/world/mcewan-denounces-authors-of-nihilism-in-israel-20110221-1b2lj.html |title=Ian McEwan attacks Israeli policies &#124; Jerusalem prize |work=Sydney Morning Herald |date=22 February 2011 |access-date=26 August 2011}}</ref>—notable words, for the audience included politicians such as the Israeli President [[Shimon Peres]] and [[Nir Barkat]], the Mayor of Jerusalem. McEwan also personally attended a protest in [[Sheikh Jarrah]] against the expansion of Israeli settlements.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gordon |first=Evelyn |url=http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx?id=208843&amp;R=R2 |title=Ian McEwan joins left-wing protest in Sheikh Jarrah |work=Jerusalem Post |date=20 February 2011 |access-date=26 August 2011}}</ref>

In 2013, McEwan sharply criticised [[Stephen Hawking]] for boycotting a conference in Israel as well as the boycott campaign in general, stating that there are many countries "whose governments we might loathe or disapprove of" but "Israel–Palestine has become sort of tribal and a touchstone for a certain portion of the intellectual classes. I say this in the context of thinking it is profoundly wrong of the Israeli government not to be pursuing more actively and positively and creatively a solution with the Palestinians. That's why I think one wants to go to these places to make the point. Turning away will not produce any result".<ref>Booth and Harriet Sherwood, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/10/noam-chomsky-stephen-hawking-israel-boycott "Noam Chomsky helped lobby Stephen Hawking to stage Israel boycott"], ''The Guardian'', 10 May 2013.</ref>

In 2009, McEwan joined the [[10:10]] project, a movement that supports positive action on climate change by encouraging people to reduce their carbon emissions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.1010global.org/uk/who |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-12-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928131628/http://www.1010global.org/uk/who |archive-date=28 September 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In 2013, as part of a wide-ranging interview with [[Channel 4 News]], McEwan discussed the furore that surrounded his remarks on [[Islamism]] in 2008, stating "I remember getting a lot of stick five or six years ago saying something disobliging about jihadists. There were voices, particularly on the left, that thought anyone who criticised Islamism was really criticising Islam and therefore racist. Well, those voices have gone quiet because the local atrocities committed by Islamists whether in Pakistan or Mali is so self-evidently vile".<ref name="channel4.com">[http://www.channel4.com/news/iraq-war-marchers-vindicated-a-a-decade-on-ian-mcewan "Iraq war marchers 'vindicated' a decade on - Ian McEwan"], 4 News, 11 February 2013.</ref> In the same interview, McEwan remarked that he felt that [[Iraq War protests|protestors]] of the 2003 [[Iraq War]] were "vindicated" by what happened subsequently; argued that the chief legacy of the Iraq War was that "[...] sometimes there are things we could do [before that war] which we no longer can" in foreign affairs; stated that at one point prior to the 2003 invasion he had hoped to be able to seek an audience with [[Tony Blair]] to persuade him not to go ahead with the war; and as someone who voted for the Liberal Democrats in the 2010 UK general election, that the current [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|coalition government]] of the United Kingdom should end, stating "Let's either have a Tory government or let [[Ed Miliband]] try something different", to try and turn around a country of "great inequity". McEwan is traditionally a Labour supporter and said he had his "fingers crossed" that Miliband would become Prime Minister.<ref name="channel4.com"/>

Following [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|the referendum on the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union]] resulting in a win for the Leave or [[United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union|'Brexit']] campaign in June 2016, McEwan wrote a critical opinion article for ''The Guardian'' titled "Britain is changed utterly. Unless this summer is just a bad dream", published on 9 July 2016.<ref name="theguardian.com">Ian McEwan, [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/09/country-political-crisis-tories-prime-minister "Britain is changed utterly. Unless this summer is just a bad dream"], ''The Guardian'', 9 July 2016.</ref> In the article, McEwan attempted to make sense of the aftermath and consequences of the 'Brexit' vote, noting: "Everything is changed utterly. Or about to be, as soon as your new leader is chosen. The country you live in, the parliamentary democracy that ruled it, for good or bad, has been trumped by a plebiscite of dubious purpose and unacknowledged status. From our agriculture to our science and our universities, from our law to our international relations to our commerce and trade and politics, and who and what we are in the world – all is up for a curious, unequal renegotiation with our European neighbours".<ref name="theguardian.com"/> McEwan's piece appeared to conclude with a sense of bewilderment and unease at how events were panning out, anticipating the ascension of [[Theresa May]] to the [[2016 Conservative Party (UK) leadership election|leadership]] of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and her appointment as Prime Minister, and noting how the previously unthinkable in British politics had actually happened.<ref name="theguardian.com"/> McEwan's article was published on 9 July, and May effectively won the Conservative Party leadership contest on 11 July, which precipitated her appointment as Prime Minister two days later. In May 2017, speaking at a London conference on Brexit, apparently referring to what he believed to be the older demographic of leave voters, McEwan stated that 'one and a half million oldsters freshly in their graves' would result in a putative second referendum returning a 'remain' outcome.<ref>Dan Roberts, [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/12/15m-oldsters-in-their-graves-could-swing-second-eu-vote-says-ian-mcewan "Death of '1.5m oldsters' could swing second Brexit vote, says Ian McEwan"], ''The Guardian'', 12 May 2017</ref>

==Personal life==
McEwan has been married twice. His first marriage was to Penny Allen, an astrologer and alternative practitioner, with whom he had two sons. The marriage ended in 1995. Two years later in 1997, McEwan married Annalena McAfee, a journalist and writer who was formerly the editor of The ''Guardian{{'}}s Review'' section.<ref>{{cite news |last=O'Kelly |first=Lisa |title=Annalena McAfee: 'I see myself as a recovering journalist' |work=The Guardian |date=10 April 2011 |access-date=12 May 2021 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/apr/10/annalena-mcafee-spoiler-ian-mcewan-interview}}</ref> McEwan lives in London.

In 2002, McEwan discovered that he had a brother who had been given up for adoption during the Second World War; the story became public in 2007.<ref>{{cite news |last=Cowell |first=Alan |title=Ian McEwan's life takes twist with discovery of a brother |work=International Herald Tribune |date=17 January 2007 |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/01/17/news/brother.php |access-date=23 March 2007}}</ref> The brother, a bricklayer named David Sharp, was born six years earlier than McEwan, when their mother was married to a different man. Sharp has the same mother and father as McEwan but was born from an affair that occurred before they married. After her first husband was killed in combat, McEwan's mother married her lover, and Ian was born a few years later.<ref>{{cite news |title=Novelist McEwan discovers brother |work=BBC News |date=11 January 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6269887.stm |access-date=22 March 2007}}</ref> The brothers are in regular contact and McEwan has written a foreword to Sharp's memoir.

McEwan was a long-time friend of [[Christopher Hitchens]], the writer and polemicist.<ref name="Farndale"/>
