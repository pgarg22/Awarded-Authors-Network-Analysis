'''Lascelles Abercrombie''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FBA|size=100%}} (9 January 1881 &ndash; 27 October 1938)<ref name=EB/> was a British [[poet]] and literary critic, one of the "[[Dymock poets]]". After the First World War he worked as a professor of English literature in a number of English universities, writing principally on the theory of literature.

==Biography==
Abercrombie was born in [[Ashton upon Mersey]], [[Sale, Greater Manchester|Sale, Cheshire.]]<ref name="CBD">Thorne, J. O. and Collocott, T. C., eds. (1984). ''[[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]]'', revised ed. (Chambers), p. 4; {{ISBN|0-550-18022-2}}; accessed 5 May 2014.</ref> He was educated at [[Malvern College]],<ref>''Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of Literature'' (1995) Merriam-Webster Inc. p. 3; {{ISBN|978-0-87779-042-6}}.</ref> and at [[Owens College|Owens College, Manchester]].<ref name=EB/>

Before the [[World War I|First World War]], he lived for a time at [[Dymock]] in [[Gloucestershire]], part of a community of poets, including [[Robert Frost]], and often visited by [[Rupert Brooke]], and [[Edward Thomas (poet)|Edward Thomas]]. These were known as the [[Georgian Poetry|Georgian Poets]]. During these early years, he earned his living reviewing books, and started his poetry writing. His first book, ''Interludes and Poems'' (1908), was followed by ''Mary and the Bramble'' (1910) and the play ''Deborah'', and later by ''Emblems of Love'' (1912) and ''Speculative Dialogues'' (1913). His critical works include ''An Essay Towards a Theory of Art'' (1922), and ''Poetry, Its Music and Meaning'' (1932). ''Collected Poems'' (1930) was followed by ''The Sale of St. Thomas'' (1930), a dramatic poem.<ref name=EB/>

During [[World War I]], he served as a munitions examiner, after which, he was appointed to the first lectureship in poetry at the [[University of Liverpool]].<ref name=EB/> In 1922 he was appointed Professor of English at the [[University of Leeds]] in preference to [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], with whom he shared, as author of ''The Epic'' (1914), a professional interest in [[heroic poetry]].<ref>Humphrey Carpenter, ''J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography'', 1977, p. 114.<!-- ISBN needed --></ref> In 1929 he moved on to the [[University of London]], and in 1935 to the prestigious Goldsmiths' Readership at the [[University of Oxford]],<ref name="CBD"/> where he was elected as a Fellow of [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton College]].<ref name="MCreg">{{cite book|editor1-last=Levens|editor1-first=R.G.C.|title=Merton College Register 1900-1964|date=1964|publisher=Basil Blackwell|location=Oxford|page=261}}</ref> He wrote a series of works on the nature of poetry, including ''The Idea of Great Poetry'' (1925) and ''Romanticism'' (1926). He published several volumes of original verse, largely metaphysical poems in dramatic form, and a number of verse plays. Abercrombie also contributed to ''[[Georgian Poetry]]'' and several of his verse plays appeared in ''New Numbers'' (1914).<ref>The Oxford Companion to English Literature, 6th Edition. Edited by Margaret Drabble, Oxford University Press, 2000 p.2</ref> His poems and plays were collected in 'Poems' (1930).<ref name="CBD"/><ref>{{cite book |editor-first=Jeffrey |editor-last=Cooper |title=Lascelles Abercrombie, 1881–1938: Towards a Complete Checklist of his Publications |location=Blackburn |publisher=White Sheep Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-9548682-0-X }}</ref>

Lascelles Abercrombie suffered in his later years from serious diabetes, and died in [[London]] in 1938, aged 57.<ref name=EB/>

At the end of the Second World War, it was discovered that despite his death Abercrombie's name had been mistakenly included in "[[The Black Book (list)|The Black Book]]" or ''Sonderfahndungsliste G.B.'' list of Britons who were to be arrested in the event of a Nazi invasion of Britain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forces-war-records.co.uk/hitlers-black-book/person/2762/lascelles-abercrombie/|title=Hitler's Black Book - information for Lascelles Abercrombie|website=Forces-war-records.co.uk|access-date=9 November 2019}}</ref>

===Family===
Abercrombie was the brother of architect and noted town planner [[Patrick Abercrombie]]. In 1909 he married Catherine Gwatkin (1881–1968) of [[Grange-over-Sands]]. They had 4 children, a daughter and three sons.  Two of the sons achieved prominence, [[David Abercrombie (linguist)|David Abercrombie]] as a phonetician and [[Michael Abercrombie]] as a cell biologist.<ref name="DNB">{{cite journal|last1=Elton|first1=Oliver|title=Abercrombie, Lascelles (1881–1938)|journal=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|date=2004|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com|access-date=7 August 2016}}</ref> Latter's son [[Nicholas Abercrombie]] is a sociologist.

==Poetry and Plays==
Abercrombie's poetry consists very largely of long poems in blank verse, mainly in dramatic form. They treat the extremes of imagined rather than actual experience, from ecstasy to anguish and malice, with little in between, in poetry full of sharp, gem-like imagery and generally rugged in sound and meter. Admired for a time by good judges such as [[Charles Williams (British writer)|Charles Williams]], [[Oliver Elton]] and [[Una Ellis-Fermor]], and respected by his fellow 'Georgian' poets, it was never popular, and by the late twenties seemed utterly out of date.

His 'Four Short Plays' of 1922 have fared better and still receive some attention, particularly 'The Staircase', because of their more realistic characters and setting. They compare favourably to the poetic plays of the other Georgian poets, such as [[John Drinkwater (playwright)|John Drinkwater]] and [[John Masefield]].
