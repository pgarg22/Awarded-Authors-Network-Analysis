==Life==
[[File:Pantycelyn Farm (geograph 2032654).jpg|thumb|Pantycelyn farmhouse]]
Williams was born in 1717 at Cefn-coed farm in the parish of [[Llanfair-ar-y-bryn]] near [[Llandovery]] in Carmarthenshire, the son of John and Dorothy Williams. John died in 1742 and Dorothy later moved to the nearby farm of [[Pantycelyn]] ("Holly Hollow"). William Williams himself is often referred to as Pantycelyn.

The family were [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformists]]. He was educated locally and then at a nonconformist academy near [[Talgarth]]. He had intended to study medicine, but this changed in 1737/1738, when he was converted by the preaching of the [[evangelical]] Methodist revivalist [[Howell Harris]] in [[Talgarth]].

For much of his life, Williams lived in the parish of Llanfair-ar-y-bryn. He died at Pantycelyn in January 1791, at the age of 74, and is buried in Llanfair-ar-y-bryn churchyard. He is also commemorated by a memorial chapel in Llandovery.

==Religious figure==
[[File:William William Gravestone.jpg|thumb|Gravestone of William Williams]]
William Williams felt called to the [[priesthood]]; and in 1740, despite his family's links with the Nonconformist branch of Christianity, he took [[deacon]]'s orders in the [[state religion|Established]] [[Anglican Church]]. (Since [[disestablishmentarianism|disestablishment]] in 1920, the Anglican church in Wales has been known as the [[Church in Wales]].)

His first appointment was as [[curate]] to [[Theophilus Evans]] (1693–1767) in the parishes of [[Llanwrtyd]], [[Abergwesyn|Llanfihangel Abergwesyn and Llanddewi Abergwesyn]]. Around this time he became involved in the [[Methodist]] movement and in June 1742 his disapproving parishioners reported his activities to the Archdeacon's Court in [[Brecon]]. Methodism was originally a reformist faction within the [[Church of England]] and was not intended to be a separatist movement or church. It was nevertheless seen as a threat to the Anglican establishment, and in 1743, when Williams duly applied for [[ordination]] as a priest, his application was refused because of his Methodist [[connexionalism|connection]]. Rather than a comfortable, conformist career in the Anglican Church, he chose a financially precarious, but perhaps spiritually richer life as a Methodist preacher.

The key years in the foundation of English Methodism were between 1739, when the brothers [[Charles Wesley|Charles]] and [[John Wesley]], both Anglican priests, broke with the [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] church and set up their own first chapel in [[Bristol]], and 1743, when they drew up their ''General Rules''. This was, unfortunately, the very time that Williams was beginning his own career in the Church and partly explains the hostility he experienced from his congregation and from the hierarchy. Williams paid a higher price for his beliefs than did the Wesleys. Williams was shut out of the Establishment at the start of his career, whilst the Wesleys had already been ordained.

Welsh Methodism predates 1739 and can be traced back to the conversions of the two main leaders of the Welsh Methodists, [[Howell Harris]] and [[Daniel Rowland (preacher)|Daniel Rowland]], in 1735. It was an indigenous, parallel movement to its sister movement in England, and the Welsh Methodists were mainly Calvinists, who worked much more closely with [[George Whitefield]] than they did with John Wesley.

Charles Wesley declared that his own Methodism was not incompatible with his Anglicanism and he was buried as an Anglican. John Wesley's doctrine was more favourable to [[Arminianism]] than to [[Calvinism]]. In Wales, however, most Methodists followed Calvinist teaching, and this led to great tensions between the Welsh Calvinistic Methodists and the [[Wesleyan Methodist Church (Great Britain)|Wesleyan Methodists]], especially after the Wesleyan Methodists began actively evangelising in Welsh-speaking Wales from 1800 onwards. In 1811, the Welsh Calvinist Methodists, now usually called the [[Presbyterian Church of Wales]], seceded from the Anglican Church and ordained their own ministers. Had he lived a little longer, Williams Pantycelyn would no doubt have approved of these moves, because as a Methodist, he himself became a firm advocate of Calvinist Reformation doctrine and frequently invoked stern warnings against [[Arminianism]], [[Arianism]], [[Socinianism]], [[Sandemanianism]] and other teachings. [''See:'' G. T. Hughes: p.&nbsp;7].

Williams Pantycelyn travelled throughout Wales (he is said to have partly supported his ministry by selling tea)<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/themes/religion/religion_hymnwriters_preachers.shtml BBC Wales]</ref> preaching the doctrine of Calvinistic Methodism. He needed to be not only a theologian and an advocate for the new [[Connexionalism|Connexion]], but also an organiser and administrator. His converts gathered in ''seiadau'' (fellowship meetings). Williams had to organise, and then maintain, these ''seiadau'' as he went around the country. Each successful visit to a new locality in turn required a new ''seiat''. Although he was not alone in his mission, the workload and mental burden must have been considerable. By the same token, it must have been deeply rewarding to see the community grow and thrive over the years and to reflect on the alternative life he had forsaken, as the priest of some obscure rural Anglican parish in mid-Wales.

Together with Harris and Rowland, William Williams "Pantycelyn" is acknowledged as a leader of the [[Methodist Revival]] in Wales in the 18th century and as the "literary voice" ''par excellence'' of that movement.

William Williams Pantycelyn was not merely an important figure in the religious life in Wales, he was also one of the most important influences on Welsh language culture, not just in his own lifetime, but on into the 19th and 20th centuries. He is particularly known as a hymn writer and his ability earned him the accolade ''y pêr ganiedydd'' ('The Sweet Songster'), echoing the description of King David as "the sweet psalmist of Israel" ({{Bibleverse|2 Samuel|23:1|KJV}}).

His literary output has been analysed in [[Saunders Lewis|Saunders Lewis's]] book ''Williams Pantycelyn'' (1927).<ref>{{Cite web |last1=James |first1=E. Wyn |title=Williams Pantycelyn |url=http://www.gwales.com/bibliographic/?isbn=9781783169627 |website=Gwales |publisher=[[Welsh Books Council]] |language=cy}}</ref>

===Hymns===
He wrote some of his work in English, but the great majority in his native Welsh. He published his first work in 1744: this was the first part of ''Aleluia'', a collection of hymns in Welsh. It was followed by further collections:
*1751: ''Hosanna i Fab Dafydd'' (Hosannah to the Son of David). 
*1759: ''Rhai hymnau a chaniadau duwiol'' (Some hymns and divine songs).
*1762: ''Caniadau y rhai sydd ar y môr o wydr'' (The songs of those on the crystal sea).
*1763: ''Ffarwel weledig, groesaw anweledig bethau'' (Farewell seen, and welcome unseen things).
*1771: ''Gloria in excelsis''.
*1772: ''[[O'er the Gloomy Hills of Darkness]]''
*1774: ''Ychydig hymnau'' (A few hymns).
*1782: ''Rhai hymnau newyddion'' (Some new hymns).

He also published two collections of English hymns:
*1759: ''Hosannah to the son of David''.
*1772: ''Gloria in excelsis''.

Undoubtedly his best known hymn is "Arglwydd, arwain trwy'r anialwch" (in English, "Lord, lead thou through the wilderness"). This was soon translated into English by [[Peter Williams (Welsh Methodist)|Peter Williams]]: "Guide Me, O Thou Great Jehovah" or "Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer". It is usually sung to the tune ''[[Cwm Rhondda]]'' by [[John Hughes (1873–1932)|John Hughes]].

===Poetry===
His hymns were not his only major contribution to the success of Calvinistic Methodism. He wrote two long poems on [[theological]] and religious themes:
*1756: ''Golwg ar deyrnas Crist'' (A view of Christ's kingdom). The history of salvation and God's grace in Christ. 
*1764: ''Bywyd a marwolaeth Theomemphus'' (Life and death of Theomemphus). The religious experience of conversion and Christian living.

He also wrote a series of elegies in memory of various Methodist and other Christian leaders, including: [[Griffith Jones (Llanddowror)|Griffith Jones]] of [[Llanddowror]], Howel Davies (the [[Pembrokeshire]] preacher), [[George Whitefield]], and [[Daniel Rowland (preacher)|Daniel Rowland]].

===Prose works===
Williams wrote original prose works and also translated others from English. Most were intended to assist the members of the Methodist fellowships he established.

He wrote about the 1762 Revival:
*1762: ''Llythyr Martha Philopur at y Parchedig Philo Evangelius eu hathro'' (Martha Philopur's letter to the Reverend Philo Evangelius her teacher), followed by:
*1763: ''Atteb Philo-Evangelius i Martha Philopur'' (Philo-Evangelius's reply to Martha Philopur). 
These works were intended to defend and teach the significance of the 1762 revival at [[Llangeitho]]. 
The 1762 revival was a powerful one, which manifested its power physically. As a result, Methodists in Wales were often known as [[Methodist Jumpers|Jumpers]].

*1762 to 1779: ''Pantheologia, Neu Hanes Holl Grefyddau'r Byd'' (Pantheologia, or a History of all the World's Religions).
*1767: ''Crocodil Afon yr Aifft'' (Crocodile of the River of Egypt).
*1768: ''Hanes Bywyd a Marwolaeth Tri Wyr o Sodom a'r Aifft'' (A history of the life and death of three men of Sodom and Egypt).
*1774: ''Aurora Borealis: neu, Y Goleuni yn y Gogledd'' (Aurora Borealis: The Northern Lights).

He wrote practical guides for a Christian life:
*1777: ''Doctor Nuptarum neu gyfarwyddwr priodas'' (Teacher of the Nuptials or the marriage guide), and:
*1777: ''Drws y society profiad'' (A gateway to the experience meeting).
These were for the converts who were members of the ''seiadau'' or societies.
