His writing career began in 1990 when his first published short story ''Six Dead Boys in a Very Dark World'' won [[Newsfield Publications#Fear|Fear magazine]]'s Best New Author award.<ref name = " sf site" >{{ cite web | last = Auden | first = Sandy | title = Computer Viruses in Books An Interview with Mark Chadbourn | work = the SF Site| year = 2005 | url = http://www.sfsite.com/06b/samc202.htm | accessdate = 2007-12-10 }}</ref> It attracted the attention of agents and publishers.

Six of his novels have been shortlisted for the [[British Fantasy Award|British Fantasy Society's]] August Derleth Award for Best Novel, and he has won the British Fantasy Award twice, for his novella ''The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke''(2003), and for his short story ''Whisper Lane''(2007).<ref name=" British Fantasy Awards 2007">[http://www.britishfantasysociety.org/awards.html The British Fantasy Society - The BFS Awards 2008<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211021606/http://www.britishfantasysociety.org/awards.html |date=2007-12-11 }}</ref>

His novel ''[[Jack of Ravens]]'' was published in the UK on 20 July 2006. It is the first in a new sequence called ''[[Kingdom of the Serpent]]''.  The second book, ''The Burning Man'', was published in April 2008. The final book in the trilogy, [[Kingdom of the Serpent|Destroyer of Worlds]], has been published in July 2009.

The earlier books include two series, ''[[The Age of Misrule (series)|The Age of Misrule]]'' and ''[[The Dark Age (series)|The Dark Age]]''.

Mark has been described as 'a contemporary bard - a post-industrial Taliesin whose visionary novels are crammed with remixed mythologies, oneiric set pieces, potent symbols, unsettling imagery and an engaging fusion of genre elements. The author's ambition is sustained by his invention: his work is distinguished by breakneck but brilliantly controlled plots, meticulous research, deft characterisation and a crisp, accessible prose style.'<ref name="subconcious do it's job"/>

He also writes historical novels under the pseudonym "James Wilde". He announced on Twitter that his novel Pendragon was shortlisted for Best Published Novel in the Wilbur Smith Adventure Writing Award, the result to be announced in September 2018. Chadbourn was a runner-up. But a year later the best-selling adventure writer Wilbur Smith, who established the award, contacted Chadbourn and asked if he would like to collaborate on a novel, as mentioned on both authors' websites. The result, The New Kingdom, is a historical fantasy set in Ancient Egypt and will be published in September 2021.

In addition to his novels he also is a scriptwriter for [[the BBC]] drama [[Doctors (2000 TV series)|Doctors]].<ref name =" blakefriedmann"/> In 2014, he announced on his website that his contemporary thriller TV series ''Shadow State'' had been optioned by Clerkenwell Films.
