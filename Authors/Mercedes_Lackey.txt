'''Mercedes Ritchie Lackey''' (born June 24, 1950) is an American writer of [[Fantasy literature|fantasy novels]]. Many of her novels and trilogies are interlinked and set in the world of [[Velgarth]], mostly in and around the country of [[Valdemar (fictional country)|Valdemar]].  Her Valdemar novels include interaction between human and non-human protagonists with many different cultures and social [[mores]].

Her other main world is one much like our own, but it includes clandestine populations of elves, mages, vampires, and other mythical beings. The ''Bedlam's Bard'' books describe a young man with the power to work magic through music; the ''SERRAted Edge'' books are about racecar driving elves; and the ''Diana Tregarde'' thrillers center on a [[Wiccan]] who combats evil.

She has also published several novels re-working well-known fairy tales set in a mid-19th to early 20th century setting in which magic is real, although hidden from the mundane world.  These novels explore issues of ecology, social class, and gender roles.

Lackey has published over 140 books and writes novels at a rate of 5.5 per year on average. She has been called one of the "most prolific science fiction and fantasy writers of all time."<ref>{{cite web | last=Stamm | first=Emily | last2=Anders | first2=Charlie Jane | title=11 Most Prolific Science Fiction and Fantasy Authors of All Time | website=io9 | date=October 11, 2013 | url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/11-most-prolific-science-fiction-and-fantasy-authors-of-1443957263 | access-date=February 4, 2021}}</ref> In 2021, Lackey was named the 38th [[Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award|Damon Knight Grand Master]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Mercedes Lackey Named the 38th SFWA Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master | website=The Nebula Awards® | date=November 4, 2021 | url=https://nebulas.sfwa.org/mercedes-lackey-named-the-38th-sfwa-damon-knight-memorial-grand-master/ | access-date=November 4, 2021}}</ref>

==Background==
Lackey was born in [[Chicago]].{{r|pringle}} Her birth prevented her father from being called to serve in the [[Korean War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercedeslackey.com/biography.html |title=Biography |publisher=Mercedes Lackey |date=1950-06-24 |access-date=2012-09-13}}</ref>

She places her meeting with [[science fiction]] at age 10 or 11, when she picked up her father's copy of [[James H. Schmitz]]'s ''[[Agent of Vega]]''. She then read [[Andre Norton]]'s ''Beast Master'' and ''Lord of Thunder'' and continued to read all of Norton's works. Lackey had difficulties obtaining enough interesting books from the public library to sate her passion for reading.  She wrote for herself but without real direction or purpose until she attended [[Purdue University]].  Lackey graduated from Purdue in 1972.<ref>{{cite web | title=Mercedes Lackey Book List | website=FictionDB | url=http://www.fictiondb.com/author/mercedes-lackey~21146.htm | access-date=February 4, 2021}}</ref>

While at Purdue, she took a one-on-one class of English Literature Independent Studies with a professor who was a fellow [[science fiction fandom|science fiction fan]]. He helped her analyze books she enjoyed and then use that knowledge. Lackey then encountered [[fan fiction]], which further encouraged her writing. She began publishing work in [[science fiction fanzines]] and then discovered [[filk]] and had some filk lyrics published by Off Centaur Publications.

==Professional sales==
[[File:Mercedes Lackey 1a.jpg|right|thumb|Lackey signing autographs at [[CONvergence]]]]
Lackey submitted a story to ''[[Sword and Sorceress series|Sword and Sorceress]]'', then sold the rewritten story to ''Fantasy Book Magazine''. Her first sale was to ''Friends of Darkover''.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

She met [[C. J. Cherryh]] through [[Filk music|filk]]. Cherryh helped Lackey through 17 rewrites of 'Arrows'. During this time, [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]] included Lackey's short stories in an anthology. Lackey claims to have been writing so much during this time that she had no social life at all. She divorced Tony Lackey, and eventually married Larry Dixon.<ref name=FantasticFiction>{{cite web | title=Mercedes Lackey | website=Fantastic Fiction | url=http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/l/mercedes-r-lackey | access-date=February 4, 2021}}</ref>

===Stance on fanfiction===
Despite getting her own start as a fan fiction author, she and her agent forbade fanfiction based on her own books for many years, whether distributed offline or online. Lackey stated on her website<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercedeslackey.com/am_conventions.html |title=Mercedes Lackey Official Website, Ask Misty |publisher=Mercedeslackey.com |access-date=2012-09-13}}</ref> that this was due to the 1992 Marion Zimmer Bradley fan fiction affair, when a fan accused Bradley of copying the fan's work, and demanded writing credit and remuneration.<ref>{{cite web|author=Joseph C. McKenzie |url=http://www.fanworks.org/writersresource/?tool=fanpolicy&action=define&authorid=53 |title=Fanworks, Marion Zimmer Bradley |publisher=Fanworks.org |access-date=2012-09-13}}</ref> After several years, Lackey's policy permitted offline fanfic, but only if the author got a release form from Mercedes Lackey that said the author acknowledged that they were using characters that belong to Mercedes Lackey and that the author's work essentially became Mercedes Lackey's property to prevent "infringing on my right to make a living from my own imagination". As of 2009 this policy changed, permitting fanfiction to be licensed as derivative fiction under the [[Creative Commons]] umbrella.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercedeslackey.com/news.html |title="News" at author's website |publisher=Mercedeslackey.com |access-date=2012-09-13}}</ref>

==Personal life==
She married Anthony Lackey in 1972, and they divorced in 1990. In 1990, she married [[Larry Dixon (fantasy artist)|Larry Dixon]].{{r|pringle}} She describes their home outside of [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] as a "{{frac|2|1|2}}-story concrete dome with an octagonal wooden shell over it to make it look more like a normal house ... it's round with curved outer walls, which makes placement of furniture kind of awkward."<ref>''Valdemar Companion'', p. 68</ref>

===Other interests===
{{More citations needed section|date=February 2021}}
Lackey and Dixon have in the past worked in [[raptor rehabilitation]]. She refers to her various [[parrot]]s as her "feathered children".  The afterwords to some of her books refer to rehabilitation and [[falconry]], and this interest has influenced and informed her writing. She also enjoys beadwork, costuming, and needlework. She claims, however, to be a "wretched housekeeper, and by and large an indifferent cook"<ref>''Valdemar Companion'', p. 64</ref> Besides this, she does radar-reading during tornado season. She helps support the [[Alex Foundation]].

Lackey is active in the [[ball-jointed doll]] community.  She owns several dolls, many of which she has customized in the likenesses of her characters.

She participates in [[The Stellar Guild]] series published by [[Phoenix Pick]]. The series pairs bestselling authors like Lackey with lesser known authors in science fiction and fantasy to help provide additional visibility to them.

Lackey revealed herself to be a player of the [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] ''[[City of Heroes]]'' along with her husband and father-in-law.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/MercedesLackey/posts/10151140370339802 |title=Mercedes Lackey facebook post |publisher=[[Facebook.com]] |access-date=2012-09-13}}</ref> She revealed her identity on a player-owned forum to join the efforts to save the servers from closing down.<ref>{{cite web | title=Call to Action: Write to NCsoft | website=Titan Network | date=September 5, 2012 | url=http://www.cohtitan.com/forum/index.php/topic,4886.msg46374.html#msg46374 | access-date=February 4, 2021}}</ref>
