'''Jean Bodel''' (c. 1165 – c. 1210), was an [[Old French]] [[poet]] who wrote a number of ''[[chanson de geste|chansons de geste]]'' as well as many [[fabliaux]]. He lived in [[Arras]].<ref name=EB1911>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Bodel, Jehan |volume=4 |page=108}}</ref>

==Writings==
Bodel wrote ''[[:fr:Chanson des Saisnes|La Chanson des Saisnes]]''<ref name=EB1911/> ("Song of the Saxons") about the war of King [[Charlemagne]] with the [[Saxon people|Saxons]] and their leader [[Widukind]], whom Bodel calls ''Guiteclin''.  He also wrote a [[miracle play]] called the ''[[:fr:Le Jeu de saint Nicolas|Le Jeu de saint Nicolas]]'' ("The Game of Saint Nicolas"), which was probably first performed in [[Arras]] on 5 December 1200. Set in the middle of an epic battle between Christians and Muslims, the play tells the story of a good Christian who escapes the battle and is found praying to a statue of Saint Nicolas by the Muslim forces. The Muslim leader decides to test the saint by unlocking the doors to his treasury and leaving the statue as a guardian, stipulating that if anything were stolen the Christian would forfeit his life. Three thieves attempt to steal the treasure, but Saint Nicolas stops them. As a result, the Muslim ruler and his entire army convert to Christianity.<ref>Lynn T.

Nederman, and Richard Utz (Turnhout: Brepols, 2004), pp. 221-33.</ref>

Like another French miracle play from the same time period, ''[[Le Miracle de Théophile]]'', ''Le Jeu de saint Nicolas'' contains an invocation to the Devil in an unknown language:<ref>Discussed in: [[Émile-Jules Grillot de Givry|Grillot de Givry]], ''Witchcraft, Magic & Alchemy'', Courier Dover Publications, 1971, p. 109.</ref>
