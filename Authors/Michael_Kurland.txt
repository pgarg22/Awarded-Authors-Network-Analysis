'''Michael Joseph Kurland''' (born March 1, 1938) is an American author, best known for his works of [[science fiction]] and [[detective fiction]].  Kurland lives in [[San Luis Obispo, California]].

==Writing career==
Kurland's early career was devoted to works of science fiction. His first published novel was ''Ten Years to Doomsday'' (written with [[Chester Anderson]]) in 1964. Other notable works include ''Tomorrow Knight'', ''Pluribus'', ''Perchance'', and ''[[The Unicorn Girl]]''. ''The Unicorn Girl'' was the middle volume of the [[Greenwich Village Trilogy]] by three different authors, the other two being [[Chester Anderson]] and [[T.A. Waters]]. (Anderson's book, ''[[The Butterfly Kid]]'', was nominated for a [[Hugo Award]]). 
Kurland has also written two novels, ''[[Ten Little Wizards]]'' and ''[[A Study in Sorcery]]'', set in the world of [[Randall Garrett]]'s [[Lord Darcy (fiction)|Lord Darcy]], prefiguring his later success as a mystery writer.

Following the success of ''The Infernal Device'', which was nominated for an [[Edgar Award]] (as was his earlier ''A Plague of Spies''), Kurland turned his attention to detective fiction. Several of his subsequent novels have been sequels to ''The Infernal Device'', and feature [[Sherlock Holmes]]'s nemesis, [[Professor Moriarty]]. In this series, Professor Moriarty is an antihero (and sometimes a real hero) who resignedly tolerates Holmes's obsessively exaggerated opinion of his criminal empire, and is often brought into reluctant alliance with his nemesis in order to counter menaces ranging from threats to their associates to threats to the nation.

He has edited three themed anthologies of [[Sherlock Holmes]] short stories, ''My Sherlock Holmes'' (stories narrated by characters other than Watson or Holmes), ''Sherlock Holmes: The Hidden Years'' (stories set during the period in which Holmes was supposed to be dead) and ''Sherlock Holmes: the American Years'' (stories set in the time between Holmes' graduation from university and his meeting Dr. Watson).

He is also the author of numerous non-fiction works, including ''How to Solve a Murder: the Forensic Handbook'' and ''How to Try a Murder: the Handbook for Armchair Lawyers''.
