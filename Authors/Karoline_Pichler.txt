==Life==
She was born in [[Vienna]] to [[Hofrat]] Franz Sales von Greiner (1730–1798) and his wife Charlotte, [[Married and maiden names|née]] Hieronymus (1739–1815). In the 1770s Charlotte would visit [[Maria Theresa]] and often bring her daughter Caroline with her. As a young girl, Caroline met [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and was a pupil of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]],<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=dChLdDBfEDgC&pg=PA62 ''Sternstunden der Musik: Von J.S. Bach bis John Cage''] by Nikolaus de Palézieux, C. H. Beck, 2008, p.&nbsp;62. {{ISBN|978-3-406-57731-4}} ({{in lang|de}}</ref> who regularly performed music at the Greiners' residence. She was taught Latin, French, Italian, and English in her youth. At age 12, Pichler published her first poem.<ref name="An Encyclopedia of Continental Women Writers" />

In 1796, Karoline married Andreas Pichler, a government official, and the brother of Anton Pichler, the owner of the Viennese publisher and printer [[A. Pichlers Witwe & Sohn]].<ref>{{NDB|20|412|412|Pichler, Anton Andreas|Elisabeth Lebensaft|139176020}}</ref> Through her husband's encouragement and her own desires she led a [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] for many years that was the center of the literary life in the Austrian capital.<ref name="Major Figures of Nineteenth-Century Austrian Literature">{{cite book|last1=Becker-Cantarino|first1=Barbara|editor1-last=Daviau|editor1-first=Donald G.|title=Major Figures of Nineteenth-Century Austrian Literature|date=1998|publisher=Ariadne Press|location=Riverside, California|isbn=1-57241-047-7}}</ref>{{rp|21}} Her salon was frequented by [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]] (who set some of her poems), [[Friedrich Schlegel]], [[Louise Brachmann]], and [[Franz Grillparzer|Grillparzer]], among many others, from 1802 to 1824. She died Vienna in 1843, according to some sources by suicide.{{sfn|Jordan|2001}} 50 years after her death she was reburied at the [[Zentralfriedhof]].<ref name="An Encyclopedia of Continental Women Writers" />

Her early works, ''Olivier'', first published anonymously (1802), ''Idyllen'' (1803) and ''Ruth'' (1805), though displaying considerable talent, were immature. She made her mark in historical romance, and the first of her novels of this class, ''Agathokles'' (1808), an answer to [[Edward Gibbon]]'s attack on that hero in his ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', attained great popularity. Among her other novels may be mentioned ''Die Belagerung Wiens'' (1824); ''Die Schweden in Prag'' (1827); ''Die Wiedereroberung Wiens'' (1829) and ''Henriette von England'' (1832). Her last work was ''Zeitbilder'' (1840). Her autobiography in four volumes, ''Denkwürdigkeiten aus meinem Leben'' (''Memorables from my Life'') was published posthumously in 1844. Pichler's ''Complete Works'' consist of 60 volumes.<ref>{{Austriaforum|AEIOU/Pichler%2C_Karoline}}</ref> One of her essays was abbreviated and included in an anthology of German Women writers for German language learners.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Down|first1=Alec|title=Die deutsche Frau: An Anthology of German Women's Writing|url=http://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/sophsupp_resources/3/|website=Scholar's Archive|publisher=Sophie Project|accessdate=7 September 2017|date=2012}}</ref>
