'''Ian Hamilton Finlay''', [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (28 October 1925 – 27 March 2006) was a Scottish poet, writer, artist and gardener.

==Life==

Finlay was  born in [[Nassau, Bahamas]], to James Hamilton Finlay and his wife, Annie Pettigrew, both of Scots descent.

He was educated at [[Dollar Academy]] in Clackmannanshire and later at [[Glasgow School of Art]]. At the age of 13, with the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], he was [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|evacuated]] to family in the countryside. In 1942, he joined the [[British Army]].<ref name="NYT"/> Finlay was married twice and had two children, [[Alec Finlay|Alec]] and Ailie. He died in Edinburgh.<ref name="GNL">{{cite news

}}</ref> He is buried with his parents and wife in [[Abercorn]] Churchyard in [[West Lothian]]. The grave lies in the extreme south-east corner of the churchyard.

==Poetry==

At the end of the war, Finlay worked as a [[shepherd]], before beginning to write short stories and poems, while living on [[Rousay]], in Orkney. He published his first book, ''The Sea Bed and Other Stories'', in 1958, with some of his plays broadcast on the [[BBC]], and some stories featured in ''[[The Glasgow Herald]]''.<ref name="NYT"/>

His first collection of poetry, ''The Dancers Inherit the Party'', was published in 1960 by Migrant Press with a second edition published in 1962. The third edition, published by Fulcrum Press (London) in 1969, included a number of new poems and was inaccurately described by the publisher as a first edition, which led to a complex legal dispute.<ref>{{cite book |last=Finlay |first=Alec |author2=Ian Hamilton Finlay |title=The Dancers Inherit the Party and Glasgow Beasts |year=1996 |publisher=Polygon |place=Edinburgh |at= p. 7 (A Note on the Text) }}</ref> ''Dancers''  was included in its entirety in a ''New Directions'' annual a few years later.

In 1963, Finlay published ''Rapel'', his first collection of [[concrete poetry]] (poetry in which the layout and [[typography]] of the words contributes to its overall effect), and it was as a concrete poet that he first gained wide renown. Much of this work was issued through his own Wild Hawthorn Press, in his magazine ''[[Poor. Old. Tired. Horse.]]''<ref>Kettle's Yard Guide, Cambridge 2008 {{ISBN|9781904561279}}</ref>

Finlay became notable as a poet, when reducing the [[monostich]] form to one word<ref>Hirsch, Edward 'A Poets Glossary', Houghton Mifflin HRcourt, Boston 2014 {{ISBN|9780151011957}}</ref> with his [[Concrete poetry|concrete]] poems in the 1960s.<ref>Perloff, Marjorie Review 'Dreams of Weeds' T L S London April 29, 2005</ref> Repetition, imitation and tradition lay at the heart of Hamilton's poetry,<ref>Matsumoto, Lila 'Imitation, Reflection, Tradition: Some Reflections on the Poetry of Ian Hamilton Finlay' Forum Issue 15, University of Edinburgh Autumn 2012</ref> and exploring ' the juxtaposition of apparently opposite ideas'.<ref>'Beauty and Revolution : The Poetry and Art of Ian Hamilton Finlay' Kettle's Yard Exhibition Catalogue (Teachers Resource) Cambridge 2014</ref>

==Art==

Later, Finlay began to compose poems to be inscribed into stone, incorporating these sculptures into the natural environment.
This kind of 'poem-object' features in the garden [[Little Sparta]] that he and Sue Finlay created together in the [[Pentland Hills]] near [[Edinburgh]]. The five-acre garden also includes more conventional sculptures and two garden temples.

He continually revisited war themes and the concept of the [[Utopia]]n [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadia]] in his work.<ref name="IanHF-Tate"/>]]

Finlay's work is notable for a number of recurring themes: a penchant for classical writers (especially [[Virgil]]); a concern with fishing and the sea; an interest in the [[French Revolution]]; and a continual revisiting of [[World War II]] and the ''[[memento mori]]'' [[Latin phrase]] ''[[Et in Arcadia ego]]''. His 1973 screenprint of a tank camouflaged in a leaf pattern, ''Arcadia'', referring to the [[Utopia]]n [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadia]] of poetry and art (another recurring theme), is described by the [[Tate gallery|Tate]] as drawing "an ironic parallel between this idea of a natural paradise and the camouflage patterns on a tank".<ref name="IanHF-Tate">{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/hamilton-finlay-arcadia-collaboration-with-george-oliver-p07025 |title=Ian Hamilton Finlay: Arcadia (collaboration with George Oliver) |publisher=Tate |work=Arcadia, 1973 |date=July 2008 |access-date=11 May 2012}}</ref> In the 1982 exhibition ''The Third Reich Revisited'', Nazi iconography featured on architectural drawings by Ian Appleton, with captions by Finlay which could be read as a sardonic critique of Scotland's arts establishment.<ref>Eyres, Patrick (1982), ''The Third Reich Revisited'' in Hearn, Sheila G. (ed.), ''[[Cencrastus]]'' No. 10, Autumn 1982, pp. 23 - 27, {{issn|0264-0856}}</ref>

Finlay's use of Nazi imagery led to an accusation of neo-Nazi sympathies and [[anti-semitism]]. Finlay sued a Paris magazine which had made such accusations, and was awarded nominal damages of one [[French franc|franc]]. The stress of this situation brought about the separation between Finlay and his wife Sue.<ref>Craig (2010)</ref>

Finlay also came into conflict with the Strathclyde Regional Council over his liability for rates on a byre in his garden, which the council insisted was being used as commercial premises. Finlay insisted that it was a garden temple.<ref>{{cite news | last = The Times | title = Ian Hamilton Finlay: Scottish poet and artist who turned his Lanarkshire grounds into Little Sparta, a celebrated shrine to pacifism | work = [[The Times|Times Online]] | publisher = Times Newspapers Ltd | date = 28 March 2006 | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article1082653.ece | access-date = 10 April 2007 | location=London}} and {{cite news | last = Jones | first = Jonathan | title = Signs of the times | work = [[The Guardian]] | publisher = Guardian Newspapers Limited | date = 10 April 2007 | url = http://arts.guardian.co.uk/art/visualart/story/0,,2053444,00.html | access-date = 10 April 2007 | location=London}}</ref>

One of the few gardens outside [[Scotland]] to permanently display his work is the ''Improvement Garden'' in [[Stockwood Discovery Centre]], [[Luton]], created in collaboration with Sue Finlay, Gary Hincks and Nicholas Sloan.

Finlay's work has been seen as austere, but also at times witty, or even darkly whimsical.

He is represented by the Wild Hawthorn Press, the Archive of Ian Hamilton Finlay, which works closely with the Ingleby Gallery (Edinburgh)<ref>{{cite web |title=Ian Hamilton Finlay |url=https://www.inglebygallery.com/artists/37-ian-hamilton-finlay/overview/ |publisher=Ingleby Gallery |access-date=23 March 2019 |quote=Ingleby Gallery work closely with Finlay's Estate and holds a substantial selection from the archive of his Wild Hawthorn Press in stock.}}</ref> and the Victoria Miro Gallery (London) in the U.K.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ian Hamilton Finlay |url=https://www.victoria-miro.com/artists/5-ian-hamilton-finlay/ |publisher=[[Victoria Miro Gallery]] |access-date=23 March 2019}}</ref>
