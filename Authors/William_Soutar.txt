'''William Soutar''' (28 April 1898 – 15 October 1943) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[poet]] and diarist who wrote in English and in [[Braid Scots]]. He is known best for his [[epigrams]].<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00mr8yj/profiles/william-soutar William Soutar] www.bbc.co.uk, accessed 4 May 2013</ref><ref>ODNB entry by Joy Hendry.

==Life and works==
William Soutar was born on 28 April 1898 on South Inch Terrace<ref>[https://www.pkct.org/Handlers/Download.ashx?IDMF=c6a81cd4-95a3-406e-81ad-f079910270cf%20 ''William Soutar Perth Walks''] - Perth and Kinross Countryside Trust</ref> in [[Perth, Scotland]], the only child of John Soutar (1871–1958), master joiner, and his wife, Margaret Smith (1870–1954), who wrote poetry. His parents belonged to the [[United Free Church of Scotland]]. He was educated at Southern District School, Perth, and at [[Perth Academy]], before joining the [[First World War|wartime]] [[Royal Navy]] in 1916. By the time he was demobilized in November 1918, he was suffering from what would be diagnosed in 1924 as [[ankylosing spondylitis]],<ref>{{Cite book |author=University of Edinburgh.

Soutar began to study medicine at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1919, but switched to English. He did not excel academically, but began to contribute to the student magazine. His first volume, ''Gleanings by an Undergraduate'' (1923), appeared at his father's expense, as did several others. He began to keep a diary on 18 April 1919. During that period he made contact with [[Hugh MacDiarmid]], then in [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]], and with [[Ezra Pound]]. MacDiarmid at the time was abandoning poetry in English in favour of "synthetic Scots", a literary language compiled from dialects and earlier writers such as [[Robert Henryson]] and [[William Dunbar]].

Soutar's work correspondingly altered radically, and he became a leading figure of the [[Scottish Renaissance|Scottish Literary Renaissance]], whom posthumous editors would dub "one of the greatest poets Scotland has produced."<ref>Carl Mac Dougall & Douglas Gifford: Introduction: ''Into a Room: Selected Poems of William Soutar'' (Perth and Kinross Libraries, Perth, 2000). {{ISBN|1902831225}}.</ref> His family adopted an orphaned cousin of his, seven-year-old Evelyn, in 1927, and this became a spur to him to write also for children. ''Seeds in the Wind'' (1933) was a volume of "bairn-rhymes" in Scots.<ref>Scottish Poetry Library. [http://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/poetry/poets/william-soutar. Retrieved 16 August 2013.]</ref>

By 1930 Soutar was bedridden with his disease. He died in 1943 of [[tuberculosis]] contracted in 1929. He is buried in Perth's [[Wellshill Cemetery|Jeanfield and Wellshill Cemetery]].<ref>Friends of William Soutar site. [http://www.williamsoutar.com/grave.html Retrieved 16 August 2013.]</ref> His collected poems, edited by MacDiarmid, were published in 1948. His journal, ''The Diary of a Dying Man'', appeared posthumously. One form of verse he used was the [[cinquain]] (now known as American cinquains),<ref>Brian Strand, ed., ''Flowers of Life'', a Selection of William Soutar's Cinquains (Rothesay: QQ Press, 2005) {{ISBN|1-903203-47-3}}</ref> which he preferred to call ''epigrams''.<ref>K. L. Goodwin, "William Soutar, Adelaide Crapsey and Imagism", SSL 3 (Columbia: University of South Carolina, 1965), pp. 96–100.</ref> Interest in Soutar's work in Scots and English and for adults and children, has revived considerably since the 1980s, although none of his verse was in print for his centenary in 1998.<ref>ODNB entry.</ref> In 2014 he was the subject of a BBC radio programme: ''The Still Life Poet'' by [[Liz Lochhead]].
