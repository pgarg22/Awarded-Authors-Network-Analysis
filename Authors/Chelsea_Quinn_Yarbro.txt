== The Michael teachings ==
{{Main article|The Michael Teachings}}

''Messages from Michael'' is the first in a series of four books that chronicles a three-decade-long "conversation" between a group of friends surrounding Sarah Chambers (1937≠1998) and a channeled, spiritual teaching entity that has come to be known as [[Michael teachings|Michael]]. As of September 2013 this conversation continues, as the Michael group continues to conduct closed sessions in the San Francisco Bay Area. A core concept of the teachings is "all choices made are equally valid."

Chelsea Quinn Yarbro's book presented a heavily fictionalized version of Sarah Chambers' group, identifying her under the pseudonym of Jessica Lansing. Yarbro published three more books on the subject, containing edited [[Mediumship#Channeling|channeling]] transcripts as well as additional background material.
