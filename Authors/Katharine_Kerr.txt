'''Katharine Kerr''' (born 1944)<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Mammoth Encyclopedia of Science Fiction.|last=Mann|first=George|date=2012|publisher=Constable & Robinson|isbn=9781780337043|location=London|oclc=804664796}}</ref> is an American [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] novelist, best known for her series of [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]]-influenced [[high fantasy]] novels set in the fictional land of [[Deverry]].

== Biography ==
Katharine Kerr was born in [[Cleveland, Ohio]]; her maiden name is Katharine Nancy Brahtin.  She describes her family feeling more like "British-in-exile" than American.  She describes her inability to spell properly using either the British or American systems as a result of having been taught to read solely with British books.  While still a schoolgirl, her family moved to [[Santa Barbara, California]].  In 1969, she moved to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], eventually moving to [[San Francisco]] itself.  She spent time studying at [[Stanford University]] but dropped out in the mid-1960s.  She then worked in some low-paying jobs, including work at a [[post office]].<ref name="About">{{cite web |first=Katharine |last=Kerr |title=About |url=http://deverry.com/?page_id=89 |access-date=2013-07-30}}</ref>

In 1973, she met up with Howard Kerr, an old friend of hers from secondary school; they were married that same year. In 1979, a friend gave Katharine her first fantasy-role playing game.  This gift led her to a fascination with the gaming and fantasy field, which in turn led her to write articles for gaming magazines.  She spent time as a contributing editor to [[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon magazine]] and contributed to gaming modules for both [[TSR, Inc.]] and [[Chaosium]].<ref  name="About"/> She co-authored the adventure ''[[Legacy of Blood (module)|Legacy of Blood]]'' for ''Dungeons & Dragons'', as well as adventures for the ''[[Pendragon (role-playing game)|Pendragon]]'' role-playing game.

Katharine Kerr now dedicates herself exclusively to fiction.

== Bibliography ==

=== Deverry novels ===

''See [[Deverry cycle]] for a synopsis of Deverry.''

The novels of Deverry are perhaps Kerr's best-known works.  Originally envisioned as a short story or novella, the project grew into a series of fifteen full novels.

The series is written in a non-linear style: the principal narrative is frequently interrupted by flashbacks to events that occurred decades, or even centuries, before.  These flashbacks concern the prior [[incarnation]]s of characters in the principal narrative, and provide insight into the relationships of the characters in their current incarnations.

Kerr has likened the series to a play, breaking the story into several acts:
