'''Richard Brinsley Butler Sheridan''' (30 October 1751{{spaced ndash}}7 July 1816) was an [[Ireland|Irish]] satirist, a politician, a playwright, poet, and long-term owner of the [[London]] [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Theatre Royal]], [[Drury Lane]]. He is known for his plays such as  ''[[The Rivals]]'', ''[[The School for Scandal]]'', ''[[The Duenna]]'' and ''[[A Trip to Scarborough]]''. He was also a [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]] for 32 years in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|British House of Commons]] for [[Stafford (UK Parliament constituency)|Stafford]] (1780–1806), [[Westminster (UK Parliament constituency)|Westminster]] (1806–1807), and [[Ilchester (UK Parliament constituency)|Ilchester]] (1807–1812). He is buried at [[Poets' Corner]] in [[Westminster Abbey Burials and Memorials|Westminster Abbey]]. His plays remain a central part of the canon and are regularly performed worldwide.

==Early life==
[[File:John Hoppner - Portrait of a Gentleman, traditionally been identified as Richard Brinsley Sheridan.jpg|thumbnail|left| ''Portrait of a Gentleman'', traditionally identified as Richard Brinsley Sheridan, by [[John Hoppner]]]]

Sheridan was born in 1751 in [[Dublin]], Ireland, where his family had a house on then fashionable [[Dorset Street (Dublin)|Dorset Street]]. His mother, [[Frances Sheridan]], was a playwright and novelist. She had two plays produced in London in the early 1760s, though she is best known for her novel ''The Memoirs of Miss Sidney Biddulph'' (1761).{{r|Ross}} His father, [[Thomas Sheridan (actor)|Thomas Sheridan]], was for a while an actor-manager at the [[Theatre Royal, Dublin|Smock Alley Theatre]] in Dublin, but following his move to England in 1758 he gave up acting and wrote several books on the subject of education, especially the standardisation of the English language in education.{{sfn|Rae|1897a|pp=87–88}}

While his family was in Dublin, Richard attended the English Grammar School in [[Grafton Street]]. In 1758, when he was seven years old, the Sheridans moved permanently to England.<ref>[http://www.jamesboswell.info/biography/thomas-sheridan-actor-and-teacher-elocution Thomas Sheridan Biography] at James Boswell Info; retrieved 30 June 2013.</ref>

He was a pupil at [[Harrow School]] from 1762 to 1768.{{sfn|Rae|1897|p=78}} At the end of his 1768 school year, his father employed a private tutor, Lewis Ker, to direct his studies in his father's house in London, while [[Domenico Angelo]] instructed him in fencing and horsemanship.{{sfn|Rae|1897|p=78}}

In 1772, aged 20 or 21, Sheridan fought two duels with Captain Thomas Mathews, who had written a newspaper article defaming the character of [[Elizabeth Ann Linley]], whom Sheridan intended to marry. In the first duel, they agreed to fight in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], but finding it too crowded they went first to the Hercules Pillars tavern (on the site where [[Apsley House]] now stands at [[Hyde Park Corner]]) and then on to the Castle Tavern in Henrietta Street, [[Covent Garden]].{{sfn|Wheatley|2011|p=19}} Far from its romantic image, the duel was short and bloodless. Mathews lost his sword and, according to Sheridan, was forced to 'beg for his life' and sign a retraction of the article.{{sfn|Rae|1897|p=79}} The apology was made public and Mathews, infuriated by the publicity the duel had received, refused to accept his defeat as final and challenged Sheridan to another duel. Sheridan was not obliged to accept this challenge but could have become a social pariah if he had not.{{Citation needed|date= October 2020}} The second duel, fought in July 1772 at Kingsdown near Bath,{{r|Chronicle}} was a much more ferocious affair. This time both men broke their swords but carried on fighting in a 'desperate struggle for life and honour'.{{sfn|Steinmetz|1868|p=17}} Both were wounded, Sheridan dangerously, and he had to be 'borne from the field with a portion of his antagonist's weapon sticking through an ear, his breast-bone touched, his whole body covered with wounds and blood, and his face nearly beaten to jelly with the hilt of Mathews' sword'.<ref>Fintan O'Toole: A Traitor's Kiss</ref> Mathews escaped in a [[post chaise]]. Eight days after the bloody affair the ''[[Bath Chronicle]]'' was able to announce that Sheridan was out of danger.

Later that year, Elizabeth and the 21-year-old Richard eloped and set up house in London on a lavish scale. Sheridan had little money and no immediate prospects of any, other than his wife's [[dowry]]. The young couple entered the fashionable world and apparently held up their end in entertaining. Sheridan was a patron of [[Margaret Cuyler]] and she was his presumed mistress. Under his wing she appeared at Drury Lane in January 1777 despite being a poor actress.<ref>{{Cite ODNB|title=Cuyler [married name Rice], Margaret (1758–1814), actress and courtesan|url=https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-64329|access-date=2020-11-28|year = 2004|language=en|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/64329}}</ref>

==Literary career==
{{More citations needed|section|date=July 2017}}<!--first 3 paragraphs have no citations--><br />
In 1775 Sheridan's first play, ''[[The Rivals]]'', was produced at London's [[Covent Garden Theatre]]. It was a failure on its first night. Sheridan cast a more capable actor in the lead for its second performance, and it was a huge success, immediately establishing the young playwright's reputation and the favour of fashionable London. It went on to become a standard of [[English literature]].

Shortly after the success of ''The Rivals'', Sheridan and his father-in-law [[Thomas Linley the Elder]], a successful composer, produced the opera ''[[The Duenna]]''. This piece, warmly received, played for seventy-five performances.

His most famous play, ''[[The School for Scandal]]'', premiered at Drury Lane on 8 May 1777. It is considered one of the greatest [[comedy of manners|comedies of manners]] in English. It was followed by ''[[The Critic (play)|The Critic]]'' (1779), an updating of the satirical [[Restoration play]] [[The Rehearsal (play)|''The Rehearsal'']].

Having quickly made his name and fortune, in 1776 Sheridan bought [[David Garrick]]'s share in the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]] patent, and in 1778 the remaining share; his later plays were all produced there.<ref>''The Oxford Companion to the Theatre'', edited by [[Phyllis Hartnoll]], OUP (1951)</ref> In 1778 Sheridan wrote ''[[The Camp (play)|The Camp]]'', which commented on the ongoing threat of a French invasion of Britain. The same year Sheridan's brother-in-law [[Thomas Linley the younger|Thomas Linley]], a young composer who worked with him at Drury Lane Theatre, died in a boating accident. Sheridan had a rivalry with his fellow playwright [[Richard Cumberland (dramatist)|Richard Cumberland]] and included a parody of Cumberland in his play ''The Critic''. On 24 February 1809 (despite the much vaunted fire safety precautions of 1794) the theatre burned down. On being encountered drinking a glass of wine in the street while watching the fire, Sheridan was famously reported to have said, 'A man may surely be allowed to take a glass of wine by his own fireside.'<ref>''The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations'' (1999) [[OUP]]</ref> Sheridan was the manager of the theatre for many years, and later became sole owner with no managerial role.

==Political career==
[[Image:Uncorking-Old-Sherry-Gillray.jpeg|thumb|In ''Uncorking Old Sherry'' (1805), [[James Gillray]] caricatured Sheridan as a bottle of [[sherry]], uncorked by Pitt and bursting out with puns, invective, and fibs.]]

In 1780, Sheridan entered the [[House of Commons]] as the ally of [[Charles James Fox]] on the side of the American Colonials in the political debate of that year. He is said to have paid the [[burgess (title)|burgess]]es of Stafford five guineas apiece to allow him to represent them. As a consequence, his first speech in Parliament was a defence against the charge of bribery.

In 1787 Sheridan demanded the [[impeachment]] of [[Warren Hastings]], the first [[Governor-General of India]]. His speech<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/268/6/6.html Sheridan, Richard Brinsley. "At the Trial of Warren Hastings", ''The World’s Famous Orations'', Ireland, 1906]</ref> in the House of Commons was described by [[Edmund Burke]], Charles James Fox, and [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]] as the greatest ever delivered in ancient or modern times.<ref>John O'Connor Power, 'Irish Wit and Humour', Time, 1890. p.480.  ''The Making of an Orator'', 1906, pp. 187–194</ref>

In 1793, during the debates on the [[Aliens Act 1793|Aliens Act]] designed to prevent [[French Revolution]]ary spies and saboteurs from flooding into the country, Edmund Burke made a speech in which he claimed there were thousands of French agents in Britain ready to use weapons against the authorities. To dramatically emphasise his point he threw down a knife onto the floor of the House of Commons. Sheridan shouted, 'Where's the fork?', which led to much of the house collapsing in laughter.{{sfn|Arnold-Baker|1996|p=393}}

During the [[British anti-invasion preparations of 1803–1805|invasion scare of 1803]] Sheridan penned an 'Address to the People':

<blockquote>THEY, by a strange Frenzy driven, fight for Power, for Plunder, and extended Rule—WE, for our Country, our Altars, and our Homes.—THEY follow an ADVENTURER, whom they fear—and obey a Power which they ''hate''—WE serve a ''Monarch'' whom we love—a God whom we adore...They call on us to barter all of Good we have inherited and proved, for the desperate Chance of Something better which they ''promise''.—Be our plain Answer this: The Throne WE honour is the PEOPLE'S CHOICE—the Laws we reverence are our brave Fathers' Legacy—the Faith we follow teaches us to live in bonds of Charity with all Mankind, and die with Hope of Bliss beyond the Grave. Tell your ''Invaders'' this; and tell them too, we seek no Change; and, least of all, such Change as ''they'' would bring us.<ref>Frank J. Klingberg and Sigurd B. Hustvedt (eds.), ''The Warning Drum. The British Home Front Faces Napoleon. Broadsides of 1803'' (University of California Press, 1944), pp. 93–94.</ref></blockquote>

He held the posts of Receiver-General of the [[Duchy of Cornwall]] (1804–1807) and [[Treasurer of the Navy]] (1806–1807). Sheridan was noted for his close political relationship with the [[George IV|Prince of Wales]], leading a faction of his supporters in the Commons. By 1805 when the Prince was cooling on his previous support of [[Catholic Emancipation]] Sheridan, [[George Tierney]] and others announced their own opposition to it.<ref>David, Saul. ''Prince of Pleasure: The Prince of Wales and the Making of the Regency''. Grove Press, 2000.</ref>

When, after 32 years in Parliament, he lost re-election in 1812, his creditors closed in on him and his last years were harassed by debt and disappointment. On hearing of his debts, the American Congress offered Sheridan £20,000 in recognition of his efforts to prevent the [[American War of Independence]]. He refused the offer.

==Death and commemoration==
In December 1815 Sheridan became ill and was largely confined to bed. He died in poverty. However, dukes, earls, lords, viscounts, the [[Lord Mayor of London]], and other notables attended his funeral, and he was buried in the [[Poets' Corner]] of [[Westminster Abbey]].

In 1825 the Irish writer [[Thomas Moore]] published a sympathetic two-volume biography, ''[[Memoirs of the Life of Richard Brinsley Sheridan]]'', which became a major influence on subsequent perceptions. A [[Royal Society of Arts]] [[blue plaque]] was unveiled in 1881 to commemorate Sheridan at 14 [[Savile Row]] in Mayfair.<ref>[http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/blue-plaques/search/sheridan-richard-brinsley-1751-1816-90 Sheridan Plaque – Mayfair, London] at English Heritage. Retrieved 30 June 2013</ref> Another plaque is in Stafford.

==Family life==

He was twice married. He and his first wife [[Elizabeth Ann Linley|Elizabeth]] had a son:

*[[Thomas Sheridan (soldier)|Thomas (Tom) Sheridan]], who married [[Caroline Henrietta Sheridan|Caroline Henrietta Callander]], daughter of [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|Col.]] [[James Campbell (1745–1831)|Sir James Campbell]] of Craigforth, [[Stirling]], and Ardkinglas [[Argyll]], and was the father of [[Helen Blackwood, Baroness Dufferin and Claneboye]], [[Caroline Norton]] and [[Georgiana Seymour, Duchess of Somerset]]
Elizabeth also had a daughter, Mary, born 30 March 1792 but fathered by her lover, [[Lord Edward FitzGerald]].{{sfnp|Chedzoy|1998|pp=278, 281}} After Elizabeth's death, Sheridan fulfilled his promise to look after Elizabeth and FitzGerald's baby daughter. A nurse was employed to care for the child at his [[Wanstead]] home.{{sfnp|Chedzoy|1998|p=297|ps=}} The baby had a series of fits one evening in October 1793, when she was 18 months old, dying before a doctor could attend. She was interred beside her mother at [[Wells Cathedral]].{{sfnp|Chedzoy|1998|p=298|ps=}}

In 1795, Richard B. Sheridan married Hester Jane Ogle (1776–1817), daughter of the [[Newton Ogle|Dean of Winchester]]. They had at least one child: Charles Brinsley Sheridan (1796–1843).{{r|ODNB Sheridan}} At one time Sheridan owned [[Downe House, Richmond Hill]] in London.{{r|heritage}}

==Affairs==
Sheridan was a womanizer. He had recorded affairs with [[Frances Crewe, Lady Crewe]] (he dedicated his 1777 play [[The School for Scandal]] to her), and a disastrous affair with Harriet Spencer, [[Henrietta Ponsonby, Countess of Bessborough]], beginning in 1789. Sheridan's affair with Harriet was disastrous for her, as the worst case scenario actually happened: her abusive husband Viscount Duncannon, [[Frederick Ponsonby, 3rd Earl of Bessborough]] walked in on Harriet and Sheridan having intercourse. Violently enraged, Duncannon immediately wanted to divorce Harriet. Divorce in the 18th century was social ruin for women, and Harriet narrowly escaped such calamity only when Duncannon's father [[William Ponsonby, 2nd Earl of Bessborough]] and the powerful Cavendish clan sided with Harriet, making divorcing her social suicide.<ref>''The Duchess'' by Amanda Foreman, page 233</ref>

Whilst attempting to win his wife Eliza [[Elizabeth Ann Linley]] back for the multiple time, he conceived a child with a governess named Caroline Townsend in 1789. Sheridan's friends Georgiana and Harriet helped him arrange for Caroline to go abroad to deliver, "and on her return they adopted the baby. They named her Fanny Mortimer and she grew up at Devonshire House as a sort of foundling, inhabiting a nether world between the servants' quarters and the nursery. After Georgiana died in 1806, Harriet sent Fanny to private school and eventually saw her marry quite well. Fanny always suspected that either Harriet or Georgiana was her mother and never quite recovered from learning that her true mother was a mere governess."<ref>''The Duchess'' by Amanda Foreman, page 233</ref>

==Character==
To his contemporaries, Sheridan was as known for his dazzling wit, lively humor, and political acuity as he was his duplicitousness, vindictive nastiness, and general profligacy. Sheridan was a social-climber who had no qualms about backstabbing friends to maintain his social status amongst actual aristocrats and gain power in Whig society. Perhaps the best summary of Sheridan's character was by Sir Gilbert Elliot, [[Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 1st Earl of Minto]] who observed to his wife: "He employs a great deal of art, with a great deal of pain, to gratify, not the proper passion in such affairs, but vanity; and he deals in the most intricate plotting and under plotting, like a Spanish play."<ref>''The Life and Letters of Sir Gilbert Elliot, First Earl of Minto, 1751-1806'' by Lady Minto, page 312</ref> By 1789, Sheridan's two-faced cunning made him despised by most of Whig society.<ref>''The Duchess'' by Amanda Foreman, page 208</ref>

Like most of the [[Ton (le bon ton)]], Sheridan drank heavily and was a gambling addict, and gambled most nights with money he did not have. Whilst most of his fellow gambling addicts attempted to pay their creditors, Sheridan pointedly never paid his debts, as he believed paying his creditors "only encourages them."<ref>''Sheridan'' by W. Sichel, page 167</ref>

Sheridan's behavior towards women in particular was dishonorable. A womanizer, he was a gifted apologizer and made promises he knew he would never keep to his wives and lovers.<ref>''Privilege and Scandal'' by Janet Gleeson, page 105</ref> Sheridan sexually harassed and assaulted women. An example of this is his sexual harassment and then assault of Lady Webster, later known as Lady Holland, [[Elizabeth Fox, Baroness Holland]]. After falsely accusing her of having an affair with a man she "did not care for in the least", he threatened to ruin her by telling society of her imaginary affair. When Lady Webster did not submit to his advances, he retaliated by assaulting her in her home. Lady Webster herself recorded the assault: "...when I defied [his] threat he took another most extraordinary method --I was told one day that a servant had brought a message which he would deliver to no one but myself, and before I could order him to be admitted, in entered Sheridan, wrapped up in a great watchcoat, and after my servant had quitted the room he rushed up to me and with a ferociousness quite frightful bit my cheek so violently that the blood ran on down my neck -- I had just enough sense to ring the bell and he withdrew."<ref>''Richard Brinsley Sheridan'' by Linda Kelly, page 165</ref>

By 1802, Sheridan's despicable behavior took an even more sinister turn, and he began harassing one of his few remaining friends, Harriet Spencer, [[Henrietta Ponsonby, Countess of Bessborough]].<ref>''Privilege and Scandal'' by Janet Gleeson, page 219</ref> By 1805, Sheridan's harassment of Harriet escalated into sending her threatening anonymous letters; as they had been longtime friends and former lovers, Harriet quickly deduced the author's identity as Sheridan's from his handwriting.<ref>''Privilege and Scandal'' by Janet Gleeson, page 262</ref> Sheridan accosted Harriet in public and made a scene any chance he could, reproaching her for not loving him enough and declaring his undying love for her.<ref>''Privilege and Scandal'' by Janet Gleeson, page 263</ref> Despite his cruelty towards her, Harriet was kind to him on his deathbed in 1816. In return, Sheridan "grasped her hand hard and told her he intended to haunt her after his death. Harriet, petrified, asked why, having persecuted her all his life, he was determined to continue his persecution after death. "Because I am resolved you shall remember me."" After enduring a few more minutes of his terror, Harriet fled the room.<ref>''Recollections of A Long Life'' by John Cam Hobhouse Broughton, page 102</ref> Three days later, Richard Brinsley Sheridan died alone.

Sheridan says: "Let 'em come! damn'me!!!—Where are the French Buggabo's? Single handed I'd beat forty of 'em!!! dam'me I'd pay 'em like Renter Shares, sconce off their half Crowns!!!—mulct them out of their Benefits, &c, come Drury Lane Slang over em!."]]

*Sheridan is played by [[Barry Stanton (actor)|Barry Stanton]] in the film ''[[The Madness of King George]]'' (1994). In ''[[The Duchess (film)|The Duchess]]'' (2008), a film based on the life of Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire, Sheridan is played by [[Aidan McArdle]] and ''The School for Scandal'' is performed in the movie.

* Sheridan was a village in [[Toronto Township, Ontario]], named for R. B. Sheridan. Its name was later used by a neighbourhood, Sheridan Homelands, which is now part of the City of [[Mississauga]]. Sheridan was shortlisted as the name of the newly incorporated city in 1974, which lies just west of the province's capital city of Toronto.<ref name="Mississauga, Ontario, Canada">{{citation|title=Mississauga, An Illustrated History|publisher=Windsor Books|author=Riendeau, Roger|date=1985}}</ref>

While Sheridan did indeed live in Savile Row, he lived at No. 14 rather than at No. 7 (and he died in 1816, not in 1814 as claimed in the book).<ref>{{Cite web|last=exploringlondon|date=2014-01-22|title=10 fictional character addresses in London – 9. 7 Savile Row, Burlington Gardens…|url=https://exploring-london.com/2014/01/22/10-fictional-character-addresses-in-london-9-7-savile-row-burlington-gardens/|access-date=2020-12-09|website=Exploring London|language=en}}</ref>
