'''Menander''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|n|æ|n|d|ər}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Μένανδρος}} ''Menandros''; c. 342/41 – c. 290 BC) was a Greek [[dramatist]] and the best-known representative of Athenian [[Ancient Greek comedy|New Comedy]].<ref name=Konstan>{{cite book|last=Konstan|first=David|title=Menander of Athens|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0199805198|pages=3–6}}</ref> He wrote 108 comedies<ref>Suidas μ 589</ref> and took the prize at the [[Lenaia]] festival eight times.<ref>Apollodorus: ''Chronicle'', [http://www.attalus.org/translate/apollodorus.html#43 fr.43]</ref> His record at the [[City Dionysia]] is unknown but may well have been similarly spectacular.

He was one of the most popular writers in antiquity, but his work was lost during the [[Middle Ages]] and is now known in highly fragmentary form, much of which was discovered in the 20th century.  Only one play, ''[[Dyskolos]]'', has survived almost complete.

==Life and work==

[[File:Relief with Menander and New Comedy Masks - Princeton Art Museum.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Roman, [[Roman Republic|Republican]] or [[Roman Empire|Early Imperial]], ''Relief of a seated poet (Menander) with masks of New Comedy'', 1st century B.C. – early 1st century A.D., [[Princeton University Art Museum]]]]

Menander was the son of well-to-do parents; his father [[Diopeithes]] is identified by some with the Athenian general and governor of the [[Thracian Chersonese]] known from the speech of [[Demosthenes]] ''De Chersoneso''. He presumably derived his taste for comic drama from his uncle [[Alexis (poet)|Alexis]].<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |wstitle=Menander (dramatist) |display=Menander |volume=18 |page=109–110 |first=John Henry |last=Freese |inline=1}}</ref><ref>'A Short History of Comedy', [http://www.attalus.org/poetry/lives.html#menander1 [[Prolegomena de comoedia|Prolegomena De Comoedia]], 3]</ref>

He was the friend, associate, and perhaps pupil of [[Theophrastus]], and was on intimate terms with the Athenian dictator [[Demetrius Phalereus|Demetrius of Phalerum]].<ref>Phaedrus: ''Fables'', [http://www.mythfolklore.net/aesopica/phaedrus/51.htm 5.1]</ref> He also enjoyed the patronage of [[Ptolemy I of Egypt|Ptolemy Soter]], the son of [[Lagus]], who invited him to his court. But Menander, preferring the independence of his villa in the [[Piraeus]] and the company of his mistress [[Glycera (courtesan)|Glycera]], refused.<ref>Alciphron: ''Letters'', [http://www.elfinspell.com/Alciphron2.html#79 2.3–4]</ref> According to the note of a scholiast on the ''Ibis'' of [[Ovid]], he drowned while bathing,<ref>Scholiast on [http://www.attalus.org/poetry/lives.html#menander5 Ibis.591]</ref> and his countrymen honored him with a tomb on the road leading to Athens, where it was seen by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]].<ref>Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'', [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+1.2 1.2.2]</ref> Numerous supposed busts of him survive, including a well-known statue in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]], formerly thought to represent [[Gaius Marius]].<ref name=EB1911/>

His rival in dramatic art (and supposedly in the affections of Glycera) was [[Philemon (poet)|Philemon]], who appears to have been more popular. Menander, however, believed himself to be the better dramatist, and, according to [[Aulus Gellius]],<ref>Gellius: ''Noctes Attica'', [http://www.attalus.org/translate/chronicles.html#244.43 17.4]</ref> used to ask Philemon: "Don't you feel ashamed whenever you gain a victory over me?" According to [[Caecilius of Calacte]] ([[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] in [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]], ''[[Praeparatio evangelica]]''<ref>Eusebius: ''Praeparatio Evangelica'', [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/pearse/morefathers/files/eusebius_pe_10_book10.htm Book 10], Chapter 3</ref>) Menander was accused of [[plagiarism]], as his ''The Superstitious Man'' was taken from ''The Augur'' of [[Antiphanes (comic poet)|Antiphanes]],<ref name=EB1911/> but reworkings and variations on a theme of this sort were commonplace and so the charge is a complicated one.

How long complete copies of his plays survived is unclear, although 23 of them, with commentary by [[Michael Psellus]], were said to still have been available in [[Constantinople]] in the 11th century. He is praised by [[Plutarch]] (''Comparison of Menander and Aristophanes'')<ref>Plutarch: ''Moralia'', [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Aristophanes_and_Menander*.html 853–854]</ref> and [[Quintilian]] (''Institutio Oratoria''), who accepted the tradition that he was the author of the speeches published under the name of the Attic orator [[Charisius]].<ref>Quintilian: ''Institutio Oratoria'', [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Quintilian/Institutio_Oratoria/10A*.html#1.69 10.1.69]</ref>

[[File:Menander fresco Pompeii Italy.jpg|thumb|[[Roman portraiture|Seated portrait]] of Menander, [[Roman art|Roman fresco]] from the [[Casa del Menandro]] in [[Pompeii]]]]
An admirer and imitator of [[Euripides]], Menander resembles him in his keen observation of practical life, his analysis of the emotions, and his fondness for moral maxims, many of which became proverbial: "The property of friends is common," "Whom the gods love die young," "Evil communications corrupt good manners" (from the ''Thaïs'', quoted in [[1 Corinthians 15]]:33). These [[Maxim (literature)|maxims]] (chiefly monostichs) were afterwards collected, and, with additions from other sources, were edited as ''Menander's One-Verse Maxims'', a kind of moral textbook for the use of schools.<ref name=EB1911/>

The single surviving speech from his early play ''Drunkenness'' is an attack on the politician [[Callimedon]], in the manner of [[Aristophanes]], whose bawdy style was adopted in many of his plays.{{citation needed|reason=According to whom?|date=August 2018}}

Menander found many Roman imitators. ''[[Eunuchus]]'', ''[[Andria (comedy)|Andria]]'', ''[[Heauton Timorumenos]]'' and ''[[Adelphoe|Adelphi]]'' of [[Terence]] (called by [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] "dimidiatus Menander") were avowedly taken from Menander, but some of them appear to be adaptations and combinations of more than one play. Thus in the ''Andria'' were combined Menander's ''The Woman from Andros'' and ''The Woman from Perinthos'', in the ''Eunuchus'', ''The Eunuch'' and ''The Flatterer'', while the ''Adelphi'' was compiled partly from Menander and partly from [[Diphilus]]. The original of Terence's ''Hecyra'' (as of the ''Phormio'') is generally supposed to be, not by Menander, but [[Apollodorus of Carystus]]. The ''Bacchides'' and ''Stichus'' of [[Plautus]] were probably based upon Menander's ''The Double Deceiver'' and ''Brotherly-Loving Men'', but the ''Poenulus'' does not seem to be from ''The Carthaginian'', nor the ''Mostellaria'' from ''The Apparition'', in spite of the similarity of titles. [[Caecilius Statius]], Luscius Lanuvinus, Turpilius and Atilius also imitated Menander. He was further credited with the authorship of some epigrams of doubtful authenticity; the letters addressed to Ptolemy Soter and the discourses in prose on various subjects mentioned by the ''Suda''<ref>Suda, [http://www.stoa.org/sol-bin/search.pl?db=REAL&search_method=QUERY&login=guest&enlogin=guest&user_list=LIST&page_num=1&field=adlerhw_gr&searchstr=mu%2C589 M.589]</ref> are probably spurious.<ref name=EB1911/>

==Loss of his work==
Most of Menander's work did not survive the Middle Ages, except as short fragments. [[Federico da Montefeltro]]'s library at Urbino reputedly had ''"tutte le opere"'', a complete works, but its existence has been questioned and there are no traces after [[Cesare Borgia]]'s capture of the city and the transfer of the library to the Vatican.<ref>[[Jacob Burckhardt]], ''[[The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy]]'', 1860. [[s:The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy/Part 3|Paragraph 8 of this subchapter]], but see print editions (such as Irene Gordon's (Mentor 1960) p. 158) for Burckhadt's footnote speculating on future rediscoveries.</ref>

Until the end of the 19th century, all that was known of Menander were fragments quoted by other authors and collected by [[Augustus Meineke]] (1855) and Theodor Kock, ''Comicorum Atticorum Fragmenta'' (1888). These consist of some 1650 verses or parts of verses, in addition to a considerable number of words quoted from Menander by ancient lexicographers.<ref name=EB1911/>

==20th-century discoveries==
[[File:P.Oxy. II 211.jpg|thumb|A papyrus fragment of the ''Perikeiromene'' 976–1008 ([[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 211|P. Oxy. 211]] II 211, 1st or 2nd century AD).]]
This situation changed abruptly in 1907, with the discovery of the [[Cairo Codex]], which contained large parts of the ''[[Samia (play)|Samia]]''; the ''[[Perikeiromene]]''; the ''Epitrepontes''; a section of the ''Heros''; and another fragment from an unidentified play. A fragment of 115 lines of the ''Sikyonioi'' had been found in the [[papier mache]] of a mummy case in 1906.

In 1959, the [[Bodmer papyrus]] was published containing ''[[Dyskolos]]'', more of the ''Samia'', and half of the ''Aspis''. In the late 1960s, more of the ''Sikyonioi'' was found as filling for two more mummy cases; this proved to be drawn from the same manuscript as the discovery in 1906, which had clearly been thoroughly recycled.<ref>Menander: ''Plays and Fragments'', tr. [[Norma Miller (classicist)|Norma Miller]]. Penguin 1987, p.15</ref>

Other papyrus fragments continue to be discovered and published.

In 2003, a [[palimpsest]] manuscript, in Syriac writing of the 9th century, was found where the reused parchment comes from a very expensive 4th-century Greek manuscript of works by Menander.  The surviving leaves contain parts of the ''Dyskolos'' and 200 lines of another, so far unidentified, piece by Menander.<ref name="harlfinger">[http://www.forum-classicum.de/archiv104.htm#harlfinger Dieter Harlfinger, ''Warten auf Menander im Vatikan. 400 griechische Komödienverse in einer syrischen Palimpsest-Handschrift entdeckt'', in: Forum Classicum, 2004].

==Famous quotations==
In his [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]], [[Paul the Apostle]] quotes Menander in the text "Bad company corrupts good character",<ref>{{Bibleverse|1 Cor|15:33}}</ref> which probably comes from his play ''Thais''; according to 5th century Christian historian [[Socrates Scholasticus]], Menander derived this from [[Euripides]].<ref>Socrates Scholasticus, ''Ecclesiastical History'', Book 3, Chapter 16</ref> 

"He who labors diligently need never despair, for all things are accomplished by diligence and labor." — Menander

"Ἀνερρίφθω κύβος" (''anerriphtho kybos''), best known in English as "[[wikt:the die is cast|the die is cast]]" or "the die has been cast", from the mis-translated Latin "''iacta alea est''" (itself better-known in the order "''[[Alea iacta est]]''"); a correct translation is "let the die be cast" (meaning "let the game be ventured"). The Greek form was famously quoted by [[Julius Caesar]] upon committing his army to civil war by crossing the River [[Crossing the Rubicon|Rubicon]].<ref>[[Alea iacta est]]</ref>  The popular form "the die is cast" is from the Latin ''iacta alea est'', a mistranslation by [[Suetonius]], 121 AD. According to [[Plutarch]], the actual phrase used by Julius Caesar at the crossing of the [[Crossing the Rubicon|Rubicon]] was a quote in Greek from Menander's play ''Arrhephoros'', with the different meaning "Let the die be cast!".<ref>Perseus Digital Library [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plut.+Pomp.+60.2&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0123 Plut. Pomp. 60.2]</ref> See discussion at "[[wikt:the die is cast|the die is cast]]" and "''[[Alea iacta est]]''".

{{quote|He [Caesar] declared in Greek with loud voice to those who were present 'Let the die be cast' and led the army across. ([[Plutarch]], ''Life of Pompey'', 60.2.9)<ref>See also Plutarch's ''Life of Caesar'' 32.8.4 and ''Sayings of Kings & Emperors'' 206c.</ref>}}

''[[Lewis and Short]]'',<ref>[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%231776 Online Dictionary: ''alea''], ''Lewis and Short'' at the Perseus Project. See bottom of section I.</ref> citing Casaubon and Ruhnk, suggest that the text of Suetonius should read ''Jacta alea esto'', which they translate as "Let the die be cast!", or  "Let the game be ventured!". This matches Plutarch's third-person perfect imperative {{lang|grc|ἀνερρίφθω κύβος}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|anerrhiphtho kybos}}'').

According to Gregory Hayes' Translation of "Meditations" by Marcus Aurelius, Menander is also known for the quote/proverb: "a rich man owns so many goods he has no place to shit.” (Meditations, V:12)<ref>http://seinfeld.co/library/meditations.pdf</ref>

==Standard editions==
The standard edition of the least-well-preserved plays of Menander is Kassel-Austin, ''Poetarum Comicorum Graecorum vol. VI.2''. For the better-preserved plays, the standard edition is now Arnott's 3-volume Loeb.
