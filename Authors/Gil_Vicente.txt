'''Gil Vicente''' ({{IPA-pt|ˈʒiɫ viˈsẽtɨ|lang}}; c.&nbsp;1465{{snd}}c.&nbsp;1536), called '''the Trobadour''', was a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[playwright]] and poet who acted in and [[Theatre director|directed]] his own plays. Considered the chief dramatist of Portugal he is sometimes called the "Portuguese [[Plautus]]," often referred to as the "Father of Portuguese drama" and as one of Western literature's greatest playwrights. Also noted as a [[lyric poetry|lyric]] poet, Vicente worked in Spanish as much as he worked in Portuguese and is thus, with [[Juan del Encina]], considered joint-father of Spanish drama.

Vicente was attached to the courts of the Portuguese kings [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]] and [[John III of Portugal|John III]]. He rose to prominence as a playwright largely on account of the influence of [[Queen Dowager]] [[Leonor of Viseu|Leonor]], who noticed him as he participated in court dramas and subsequently commissioned him to write his first theatrical work.

He may also have been identical to an accomplished [[goldsmith]] of the same name at the court of [[Évora]]; the goldsmith is mentioned in royal documents from 1509 to 1517 and worked for the widow of [[John II of Portugal|King John II]], [[Eleanor of Viseu|Dona Leonor]]. He was the creator of the famous [[Belém Monstrance]], and master of [[rhetoric]] of [[Manuel I of Portugal|King Manuel I]].

His plays and poetry, written in both Portuguese and Spanish, were a reflection of the changing times during the transition from [[Middle Ages]] to [[Renaissance]] and created a balance between the former time of rigid [[mores]] and [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] [[social structure]] and the new society in which this order was undermined.

While many of Vicente's works were composed to celebrate [[Religious festival|religious]] and national festivals or to commemorate events in the life of the royal family, others draw upon [[popular culture]] to entertain, and often to critique, Portuguese society of his day.

Though some of his works were later suppressed by the [[Portuguese Inquisition]], causing his fame to wane, he is now recognised as one of the principal figures of the [[Portuguese Renaissance]].<ref name="Columbia">[https://web.archive.org/web/20110606090813/http://education.yahoo.com/reference/encyclopedia/entry/Vicente "Vicente, Gil".] ''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', Sixth Edition. Columbia University Press, 2006.</ref>

==Life==
[[Image:Pt-gmr-castelo.jpg|thumb|250 px|[[Guimarães]], one of the places where it is claimed the dramatist was born]]

The year 1465, the date proposed by Queirós Veloso, is the commonly accepted year of Vicente's birth. However, Braamcamp Freire proposes the year 1460, while de Brito Rebelo proposes between 1470 and 1475. Vicente's own works indicate contradictory dates. The ''Velho da Horta'' ("Old Man of the [Vegetable] Garden"), the ''Floresta de Enganos'' ("Forest of Mistakes"), and the ''Auto da Festa'' ("[[Auto (art)|Act]] of the Party")<!-- Is it really "party"? "Feast" or "festival" might make more sense.--> indicate 1452, 1470, and before 1467, respectively. Since 1965, when official festivities commemorating the 500th birthday of the writer were held, the date of 1465 has been almost universally accepted.

Though Frei Pedro de Poiares conjectured [[Barcelos, Portugal|Barcelos]] was Vicente's birthplace, evidence for this is scarce. Pires de Lima, on the other hand, proposed [[Guimarães]], which better accounts for Vicente's identification as a [[jeweller]]. The people of Guimarães have embraced this theory; a municipal school in [[Urgezes]] is named after the playwright. There are some stories about Gil Vicente's father, that he was from this parish in Guimarães, so people believe that Gil Vicente had lived here too. Another conjecture places his birthplace at [[Lisbon]]. The [[Beira, Portugal|Beira]] region is also a candidate because of various references to it in his plays, more exactly the location of [[Guimarães de Tavares]], that has been mistaken with [[Guimarães]].

Gil Vicente married Branca Bezerra, who bore him two sons: Gaspar Vicente (died 1519) and Belchior Vicente (born 1505). After her death, he married Melícia or Milícia Rodrigues (abbreviated as Roiz), of whom were born the noted scholar [[Paula Vicente]] (1519–1576), Luís Vicente de Crasto (who organised the compilation of Vicente's works), married to Mór de Almeida and had issue, Joana de Pina (died 1584) (daughter of Diogo de Pina de Baião and wife Mécia Barreto, daughter of Francisco de Aguiar and wife Madalena Barreto) and had issue, and Isabel de Castro, without issue, and Valéria Borges (or Vicente), who was married firstly to Pero Machado, without issue, and secondly to Dom António de Meneses, son of Dom Luís de Meneses, of the bastards of the Lords de [[Cantanhede Municipality|Cantanhede]], and wife Brites de Aguiar, and had issue [http://www.geneall.net/P/per_page.php?id=68989].

It is well known the presence of the playwright in [[Santarém, Portugal|Santarém]], on the 26th of January, during the [[1531 Lisbon earthquake|1531 Lisbon Earthquake]], where rumors quickly spread, apparently encouraged by the friars of [[Santarém, Portugal|Santarém]], that the disaster was divine punishment ([[Latin]]: "Ira Dei"- Wrath of God) and that the [[History of the Jews in Portugal|Jewish community]] was to blame. Faced with social instability in the city Gil Vicent, reportedly, personally defused the situation while scolding the friars for their fear-mongering in a powerfully written letter to [[John III of Portugal|King John III]], and possibly averting a massacre of Jews and [[New Christian|recent converts to Christianity]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sacred Game: The Role of the Sacred in the Genesis of Modern Literary Fiction|last=Bandera|first=Cesareo|publisher=Penn State Press|year=2010|isbn=9780271042053|pages=44}}</ref>

Vicente died in an unknown location, some say [[Évora]]. The year of his death is commonly recorded as 1536, the year after which he ceased writing; no further reference to him is found in subsequent documents of the era. His place of burial is unknown. No surviving portraits of Gil Vicente remain.

==Career==
It is assumed that Vicente studied in [[Salamanca]]. Though he initially studied law, he soon abandoned it for literature.{{sfn|Ford|1912}}

===As a writer===
[[Image:Gil Vicente na Corte de D. Manuel I (Roque Gameiro, Quadros da História de Portugal, 1917).png|thumb|250 px|'''''O Monólogo do vaqueiro''''' (Monologue of the Cowherd), as it would have been performed by Gil Vicente himself, according to the vision of the painter<br /> [[Alfredo Roque Gameiro]].]]
[[Image:Mosteiro dos Geronimos 2.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Lisbon]]: [[Jerónimos Monastery]]]]

In 1493 he was acting as master of [[rhetoric]] to the [[Duke of Beja]], afterwards [[Manuel I of Portugal|King Manuel]], a post which gave him admission to the court.{{sfn|Prestage|1911|p=19}} His first known work, ''[[O Monólogo do vaqueiro]]'' ("[[Monologue]] of the Cowherd"), was written in Spanish and acted in the rooms of [[Maria of Aragon (1482-1517)|Maria of Aragon]], wife of King Manuel, to celebrate the birth of Prince John (later [[John III of Portugal]]). The first performance, recited by the playwright himself, took place on the night of June 8, 1502, in the presence of the king; the queen; [[Leonor of Viseu]], former Queen of Portugal and widow of [[John II of Portugal|John II]]; and [[Beatriz of Portugal]], mother of the King.

''O Monólogo do vaqueiro'' contains several elements clearly inspired by the [[Adoration of the Shepherds]] which takes place in accounts of [[Christ]]'s birth. Its staging included offerings of simple and rustic gifts, such as cheese, to the future king, from whom great achievements were expected.

Though Leonor asked him to give an encore performance of the play at the [[Christmas]] [[matins]], Vicente decided to write a new play for the occasion, the ''Auto Pastoril Castelhano'' ("Castilian Pastoral Act"). The court, pleased again, required a further diversion for [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]], whereupon he produced the ''Auto of the Wise Kings''.{{sfn|Prestage|1911|p=19}} Because of the influence of Queen Leonor, who would become his greatest patron in the years to come, Gil Vicente realized that his talent would allow him to do much more than simply adapt his first work for similar occasions.

Vicente, who was in charge of organizing events in the palace, also directed the commemoration in honour of [[Eleanor of Spain]], the third wife of Manuel I, in 1520. In 1521, he began serving [[John III of Portugal]], and soon achieved the social status necessary to [[Satire|satirize]] the [[clergy]] and [[nobility]] with impunity. His popularity even enabled him to contradict the opinions of the king, as he did in a 1531 letter defending the [[New Christian]]s.

For thirty years he entertained the courts, accompanying them as they moved from place to place, and providing by his autos a distraction in times of calamity, and in times of rejoicing giving expression to the feelings of the people. Though himself both actor and author, Gil Vicente had no regular company of players, but it is probable that he easily found students and court servants willing to get up a part for a small fee, especially as the plays would not ordinarily run for more than one night.{{sfn|Prestage|1911|p=19}}

===As a goldsmith===
Many works about Gil Vicente associate him with a goldsmith of the same name at the court of [[Évora]];<ref name="Brit2006">[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gil-Vicente-Portuguese-dramatist "Vicente, Gil".] ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online.'' 2006.</ref> technical terms used by the playwright lend credibility to this identification.

In 1881, [[Camilo Castelo Branco]] wrote the letter "{{lang|pt|Gil Vicente, Embargos à fantasia do Sr. [[Teófilo Braga]]}}" ("Gil Vicente, Refutations of the Opinion of Mr. Teófilo Braga")<!--I’ve translated this a bit less literally for the sake of clarity.-->, which argued that Gil Vicente the writer and Gil Vicente the goldsmith were two different people. Teófilo Braga, who initially believed them to be the same man, later adopted a different opinion after reading a study by Sanches de Baena which showed the different [[genealogy]] of two individuals named Gil Vicente. However, Brito Rebelo demonstrated the historical inconsistency of these two genealogies by the use of documents from the [[Arquivo Nacional da Torre do Tombo|Portuguese national archive]].

The masterpiece of Vicente the goldsmith's art was the [[monstrance]] of [[Santa Maria de Belém|Belém]] made for the [[Jerónimos Monastery]] in 1506, which was crafted from the first gold exported from [[Mozambique]]. The design of this monstrance resembles the decorations of the southern portal of the church Santa Maria de Belém of this monastery.

Three years later, he became overseer of the [[wiktionary:patrimony|patrimonies]] of the [[Convento de Cristo]] in [[Tomar]], Nossa Senhora de Belém, and the Hospital de Todos-os-Santos in Lisbon. In 1511, he was nominated [[vassal]] of the King, and a year later he was the representative jeweller in the Casa dos Vinte e Quatro. In 1513, as master of the balance of the Casa da Moeda, the Portuguese national [[Mint (coin)|mint]], Vicente the goldsmith was elected by the others masters to represent them in Lisbon.<!--Represent them at what?-->

==Written works==

[[Image:Auto de Moralidade de Gil Vicente.jpg|thumb|250 px|Illustration of the original edition of ''Auto da Barca do Inferno'' (''Act of the Ship of Hell'')]]
[[Image:Adoracao dos magos de Vicente Gil.jpg|thumb|Christmas-related themes, very present in Gil Vicente's works since the first order from Queen Leonor, have also a strongly symbolic and suggestive meaning. Here, a painting from the contemporaneous Vicente Gil (not to be confused with the playwright)]]

Vicente's oeuvre spans the years between 1500 and 1536. Most of his plays were intended for performance at [[Noble court|court]], where he and the ladies and gentlemen of the court participated in their production. He wrote no fewer than forty-four pieces, ten of which are in Spanish, fourteen in Portuguese, and the remainder in mingled Portuguese and Spanish. His plays may be grouped into four main categories: acts, or [[Liturgical drama|devotional play]]s; [[Comedy|comedies]] [[Tragicomedy|tragicomedies]]; and [[farce]]s.

Like Spain's classical dramas, his plays are often in [[verse form]]. In addition, they feature his own [[musical composition]]s and well as popular lyrics and melodies of the time.{{sfn|Ford|1912}}

He was also a noted [[Lyric poetry|lyric poet]] in both Portuguese and Spanish,<ref name="Brit2006"/> as represented by several poems in the ''Cancioneiro'' of [[Garcia de Resende]].{{sfn|Ford|1912}} He wrote a number of ''vilancetes''<!--Needs translation.--> and ''cantigas'' ("songs") which were influenced by a palatial style and the themes of the [[troubadours]].

Some of his works are profoundly religious, while other are particularly satirical, particularly when commenting upon what Vicente perceived as the corruption of the clergy and the superficial glory of [[empire]] which concealed the increasing [[poverty]] of Portugal's lower classes.<ref name="Columbia"/>

===Characteristics===
Vicente's works were partially influenced by the Iberian popular and religious theatre that was already being done. Pastoral themes present in the writings of [[Juan del Encina]] strongly influenced Vicente's early works and continued to inform his later, more sophisticated plays. The [[humanism]] of [[Erasmus]] and of [[Renaissance Italy]] also impacted his work.<ref name="Columbia"/>

Luís Vicente, his son, classified Vicente's [[sacred]] plays as acts and [[Mystery play|mysteries]] and his [[secular]] plays as farces, comedies, and tragicomedies. His plays may be further divided into [[pastoral]] acts, religious [[allegory|allegories]], [[Bible story|biblical narrative]]s, [[Episodic plot|episodical]] farces, and [[narrative]] acts. However, many of his works blend both secular and sacred elements; for example, ''Triologia das Barcas'' ("Trilogy of the Ships") contains both farcical and religious motifs.

Vicente is one of the most important satirical authors of the Portuguese language. His satires were severely critical, anticipating [[Jean-Baptiste de Santeul]]'s later epigram (often mistakenly attributed to [[Horace]] or [[Molière]]), ''castigat ridendo mores'' ("[Comedy] criticises customs through humour"). He portrayed Portuguese society of the 16th century with perceptiveness and insight, using many characters inspired by Portuguese social [[stereotype]]s of his time. In addition, [[:wiktionary:rustic|rustic]] characters, such as sailors, [[Romani people|gypsies]], and peasants, are common, as are more fantastical characters such as [[fairies]] and [[demons]]. Though he commonly referenced popular [[dialect]]s, Vicente maintained the lyricism of his words.

Positive aspects of Vicente's works include imagination, originality, and a proficiency in technical knowledge of theatre. Though spontaneous, sardonic, and emotive, his works maintain a directness and simplicity of dialogue which is lyrical without being florid or exaggerated. He expresses himself in an unexpected, [[Dionysus|Dionysian]] way which does not always obey the aesthetic and artistic principles of balance. Vicente's works seem to show a spirit in conflict: his portrayals of the flaws of others appear almost rash and cruel, while his devotional and pastoral works, and those scenes in which he defends the oppressed, give an impression of tenderness, docility, and humaneness. In contrast, his works sometimes include a romanticism which combines [[eroticism]] and [[wiktionary:waggery|waggery]] with more erudite influences such as [[Petrarch]].

===Philosophical elements===
The worlds presented in Vicente's works could be considered as representative of the duality of [[Platonic idealism]]. The first world is the abstract, an ideal place of serenity and divine love that leads to inner peace, quietness, and "resplendent glory", according to his letter to John III of Portugal. The second world, which he portrays in his farces, is the physical: a false world, tired, without order or remedy, and lacking in strength.

His satirical works depict the second world, in which human flaws are caricatured with little regard for actual or historical truth. Though critics call attention to these [[anachronism]]s and narrative inconsistencies, it's possible that Vicente considered these errors trivial in his portrayals of an already false and imperfect world. In contrast, his representations of the mythic, symbolic, and religious aspects of [[Christmas]], such as the figure of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mother]], the [[infant Jesus]], and [[Christmas eve]], demonstrate a harmony and purity which is not present in his [[social commentary]].

Unlike plays which echo [[Manichaeism]] by presenting the dichotomy of darkness and light, Vicente's work juxtaposes the two elements in order to illustrate the necessity of both. Christmas eve, one of his common motifs, is symbolic of his philosophical and religious views: the great darkness borders the divine glory of maternity, birth, forgiveness, serenity, and good will. The darkness is necessary to provide contrast with the light.

Though his [[patriotism]] is apparent in works such as ''Exortação da Guerra'' ("Exhortation of War") and ''Auto da Fama'' ("Act of Fame"), or ''Cortes de Júpiter'' ("Courts of Jupiter")<!--Are "Auto da Fama" and "Cortes de Jupiter" the same work?-->, it doesn't merely glorify the [[Portuguese Empire]]; instead, it is critical and ethically concerned, especially with the newly available vices which arose due to commerce with the East, that brought a sudden enrichment and disruption of the social fabric.

===Religious plays===
Many of Vicente's plays were composed in order to celebrate religious festivals; these seventeen plays are called his "Obras de devoção" ("Devotional works").{{sfn|Ford|1912}} In these plays, also called "autos", or "acts", Vicente blended themes from [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] [[morality plays]] with theatrical [[mumming]] and the [[liturgical drama]]s that were used in [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] [[festival]]s.

One of his first devotional plays was ''Auto da Fé'' ("Act of Faith") in 1510. Like a morality play, it explores the journey of the [[Soul]] as it travels to the arms of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Mother Church]]. On its way, it is waylaid by the [[Devil]] and led to goodness by an [[Angel]].

His [[masterpiece|magnum opus]] is considered to be the ''Triologia das Barcas'' ("Trilogy of the Ships"), which consists of the three plays ''Auto da Barca do Inferno'' ("Act of the Ship of [[Hell]]"), written 1516; ''Auto da Barca do Purgatório'' ("Act of the Ship of [[Purgatory]]"), written in 1518; and ''Auto da Barca da Glória'' ("Auto of the Ship of [[Heaven]]"), written in 1519. These plays combine morality narratives with criticism of 16th-century Portuguese society by placing stereotypical characters on a dock to await the arrival of one of the ships which will take them to their [[Afterlife|eternal destination]]. The characters are of a variety of social statuses; for example, in ''Auto da Barca do Inferno'', those awaiting passage include a [[nobleman]], a [[pimp|madam]], a corrupt judge and prosecutor, a dissolute friar, a dishonest shoemaker, a hanged man, and a [[Sephardi Jew|Jew]] (who would have been considered [[Persecution of Jews|bound for Hell]] in Vicente's time).

His religious lyricism shows the influence of the ''Cantigas de Santa Maria'' ("Songs of Saint Mary") and is exemplified in such works as ''Auto de Mofina Mendes'' ("Act of Mofina Mendes", literally, in the Portuguese of that time, "Act of Disgrace [Mofina] It Self [Mendes]), ''Anunciação'' ("[[Annunciation]]"), and in the prayer of [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] in ''Auto da Alma'' ("Act of the Soul"). For this reason, Vicente is sometimes called the "Poet of the Virgin."

His other notable religious works include ''Auto Pastoril Castelhano'' ("Castilian Pastoral Act") written in 1502; ''Auto dos Reis Magos'' ("Act of the [[Biblical Magi|Magi]] Kings") written in 1503 for Christmas celebrations; and ''Auto da Sibila Cassandra'' ("Act of the [[Sibyl]] [[Cassandra]]") written in 1503, a play which announced the Renaissance ideals in Portugal.

===Comedies and farces===
Vicente's comedies and farces were likely influenced by indigenous popular entertainment. Contemporaneous Spaniards, like [[Lucas Fernández (musician)|Lucas Fernandez]] and Torres Naharro, may also have influenced his style.{{sfn|Ford|1912}}

Vicente's comedies blended [[slapstick]] and satire; in addition, his use of dialect clearly delineated the social classes of his characters. The [[Staging (theatre)|staging]] of these plays maintained the simplicity of morality plays. For example, two simultaneous [[Scene (fiction)|scene]]s might utilize a single curtain to divide them.

''Auto da Índia'' ("Act of India"), written in 1509, was one of his first comedies. This play, which shows his proficiency with the form, is comparable to a modern [[bedroom farce]]. Vicente wrote farces throughout the rest of his life; one notable example is ''Farsa de Inês Pereira'' ("Farce of Inês Pereira"), written in 1523.

==Influence on Portuguese theatre==
[[Image:Obras de Garcia de Resende.jpg|thumb|250px|Works of [[Garcia de Resende]]. In the ''Miscelânia'', he defends Vicente as the "Father of Portuguese theatre."]]

Prior to Vicente, few dramatic stagings had taken place in Portugal. However, a few notable performances had established theatrical precedence in courtly and religious contexts.

During the reign of [[Sancho I of Portugal]] (1185–1212), Bonamis and Acompaniado, the first recorded Portuguese actors, put on a show of ''arremedillo''<!--Is this a reference to bards, or jesters, or what?--> and were paid by the King with the donation of lands.

In a document dated 1281, Dom Frei Telo, Archbishop of Braga, refers to liturgical dramas which were performed during Catholic festivities.

In 1451, theatrical acts accompanied the festivities of the wedding of ''[[Infanta]]'' (Princess) [[Eleanor of Portugal, Empress|Eleanor of Portugal]] with [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III of Habsburg]].

According to the Portuguese chronicles of [[Fernão Lopes]], [[Gomes Eanes de Zurara]], [[Rui de Pina]], and Garcia Resende, spectacular stagings took place in the courts of [[John I of Portugal]], [[Afonso V of Portugal]], and [[John II of Portugal]]. For example, Rui de Pina refers to one instance in which King John II himself played the part of The [[Knight of the Swan]] in a production which included a scene constructed of fabric waves. During the action, a fleet of [[carrack]]s with a crew of spectacularly dressed actors entered the room accompanied by the sound of [[minstrels]], [[Natural trumpet|trumpet]]s, [[kettledrum]], and [[artillery]].

Other significant Portuguese theatrical works include the [[eclogue]]s of [[Bernardim Ribeiro]], Cristóvão Falcão, and [[Sá de Miranda]], and the ''Pranto de Santa Maria'' (1435), an early liturgical drama by André Dias. Garcia de Resende, in his ''Cancioneiro Geral'', designates a few other works, such as ''Entremez do Anjo'' by D. Francisco of Portugal, Count of [[Vimioso]], and the [[wiktionary:lay#Noun|lay]]s of Anrique da Mota. Vicente likely assisted in the production of these works, which include comedic scenes.

Though Vicente did not invent Portuguese theatre, his works surpassed any done before that time. His writing in Portuguese and in Spanish shaped both modern Spanish and modern Portuguese drama.<ref name="Columbia"/> His contribution to creating new forms, such as the farce, and raising the morality play to its apotheosis created the base upon which Portuguese and Spanish drama would be built. Though some of his works were later suppressed by the Inquisition, he is now recognized as one of the greatest dramatists of the Renaissance and the leading name in Portuguese theatre. According to [[Marcelino Menéndez Pelayo]], Vicente is "the most important figure of the primitive [[Iberian peninsula|peninsular]] playwrights…[There was no one] who surpassed him in Europe in his time."

==Publication and influence on other works==
The first edition of Vicente's complete works was published in Lisbon in 1561-2 by his children Paula and Luís. In 1586, the second edition was published; however, many parts were heavily censored by the [[Inquisition]]. The third edition was not published until 1834 in [[Hamburg]] by Barreto Feio, after which Vicente's work was finally rediscovered.

Since that time, various composers, such as [[Max Bruch]] (who made Von den Rosen komm' ich (Von dem Rosenbusch, o Mutter) from Vicente's De la rosa vengo my madre [from the rose I come my mother], which also had a version by Schumann) and [[Robert Schumann]] (who made his Spanische Liebeslieder [Spanish Love Songs] no. 7. Weh, wie zornig ist das Mädchen from Vicente's Sañosa está la nina [Irritated is the little girl] and  no. 3. Lied, op. 29 no. 2 from Vicente's Canción [Song]; and two of his Spanisches Liederspiel no. 1. Erste Begegnung, op. 74 no. 1 and no. 3. Intermezzo, op. 74 no. 2), have set Vicente's poetry to music in the form of [[lied]]er. Most of these were translated into [[German language|German]] by Emanuel van Geibel.

A quote from one of Vicente's plays, "The pursuit of love is like falconry", appears in the epigraph of [[Gabriel García Márquez]]'s novel ''[[Chronicle of a Death Foretold]]''.
