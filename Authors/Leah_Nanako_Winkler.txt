She grew up in Lexington, Kentucky and she credits her high school drama teacher at Tates Creek High School for introducing her to theatre.<ref name="nktrib">{{cite web|url=http://www.nkytribune.com/2017/12/kentucky-playwright-leah-nanako-winkler-now-in-new-york-enjoying-success-on-the-theater-scene|title=Kentucky Playwright Leah Nanako Winkler Now in New York, Enjoying Success on the Theater Scene}}</ref>  Winkler moved to New York in 2006 to become a writer with the money she earned donating eggs to a fertility clinic. She worked many odd jobs to support herself and her theater career including working overnights at a 24-hour Starbucks.  She received an MFA from [[Brooklyn College]] in 2018.

==Career==
Once in New York, Winkler formed her own theatre company called Everywhere Theatre Group. ETG produced Leah's plays as well as collaboratively written plays including Big Girls Club (2007), Dead People (2008 with Theodore Nicholas), Formula Play(2009),  A Pale Horse Death Followed With: A Life Time Original Series (2008 with Theodore Nicholas)  at downtown venues including The Brick, Dixon Place and the Ontological Hysteric Theater. In 2010 ETG's play The Internet (Incubator Arts Project) garnered favorable reviews in the New York Times. In  2011 ''Flying Snakes in 3D!!'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/34692598|title=Flying Snakes in 3D!!}}</ref>  a science fiction parody meta-play about making a play when you aren't white and don't come from money ran at the Brick Theater  before transferring to the New Ohio and stirred public heated debates regarding class privileged in the theater community{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}.  Leah was subsequently invited to present a manifesto regarding these issues at the Prelude Festival in 2012 alongside Richard Foreman and Mac Wellman. Shortly after ETG imploded. Leah  continued to self-produce her short-form experimental work often at bars alongside poets and musicians. In 2013  Winkler published ''Nagoriyuki And Other Short Plays: Performed in NYC between 2008-2013''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://smile.amazon.com/Nagoriyuki-Other-Short-Plays-Performed/dp/1490366377/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1519261587&sr=8-1-fkmr0&keywords=Nagoriyuki+And+Other+Short+Plays%3A+Performed+in+NYC+betwen+2008-2013+Paperback+–+August+2%2C+2013|title=Nagoriyuki on Amazon}}</ref> In 2014, she had two plays ''Death for Sydney Black'' and ''Diversity Awareness Picnic'' on [[The Kilroys' List]], a gender parity initiative highlighting underproduced works by female playwrights.

In 2015, Winkler published another book of plays, ''The Lowest Form of Writing''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://smile.amazon.com/Lowest-Form-Writing-Nanako-Winkler/dp/1508846111/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1519262202&sr=1-1&keywords=The+Lowest+Form+of+Writing|title=Lowest Form of Writing on Amazon}}</ref> Her play ''Double Suicide At Ueno Park'' was produced by Ensemble Studio Theater.  Her blog post about a yellowface production of The Mikado started a protest and led to further controversy.

In 2016, Winkler's play ''Kentucky'' was on the Kilroys list and had its world premiere at the [[Ensemble Studio Theatre]] as a co-production with the Radio Drama Network and Page 73 Productions in New York. The play garnered favorable reviews and the Times called her a "Distinctive New Voice"
