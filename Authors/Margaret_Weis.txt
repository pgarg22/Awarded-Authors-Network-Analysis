==Early life==
Margaret Weis was born on March 16, 1948, in [[Independence, Missouri]]. She discovered [[heroic fantasy]] fiction while studying at the [[University of Missouri]] (MU): "I read [[J. R. R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] when it made its first big sweep in the colleges back in 1966," she said. "A girlfriend of mine gave me a copy of the books while I was in summer school at MU. I literally couldn't put them down! I never found any other fantasy I liked, and just never read any fantasy after Tolkien."<ref name="Dragon #120">{{cite journal |last=Hickman |first=Tracy |author-link=Tracy Hickman |title=TSR Profiles |journal=[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]] |volume=XI, No. 11 |issue=120 |page=90 |publisher=TSR, Inc. |location=[[Lake Geneva, Wisconsin]] |date=April 1987 |url=http://annarchive.com/files/Drmg120.pdf }}</ref>

===Dragonlance===
In 1983 Weis applied for a job as a games editor at [[TSR, Inc.]] that she saw [[classified advertisement|advertised]] in ''[[Publishers Weekly]]''. TSR turned her down for that position, but hired her as a book editor.<ref name="Dragon #120"/><ref name="Dragon #243"/> She worked in TSR's book division until 1986.<ref name="wizardsbio"/>

One of her first assignments was to help coordinate, along with TSR colleague [[Tracy Hickman]], "Project Overlord," which was to include a novel and three ''AD&D'' modules.<ref name="Dragon #120"/><ref name="Dragon #243"/> Weis and Hickman plotted the novel and hired an author, who didn't work out. "By that time," said Weis, "[Hickman] and I were so into the project that we felt we had to write it."<ref name="Dragon #243"/>

"Project Overlord" soon became known as [[Dragonlance]] and grew into a trilogy of novels, called the ''[[Dragonlance Chronicles]]'', and 15 linked modules.<ref name="Dragon #243"/><ref>Phillips, Casey (February 19, 2010).

Weis and Hickman also wrote the ''[[Dragonlance Legends]]'' trilogy, which was published in 1986.<ref name="designers"/>{{rp|16}} As a writing team they produced several projects based on the Dragonlance saga, which included novels, short stories, art books, and calendars in the product line.<ref name="Dragon #120"/>

In the late 1990s, [[Larry Elmore]] approached Weis and Hickman to pitch his fantasy world of Loerem, which they agreed to write about in the ''[[Sovereign Stone]]'' trilogy of books.<ref name="designers"/>{{rp|351}} Weis formed the company [[Sovereign Press, Inc|Sovereign Press]], with herself as CEO, to publish the ''[[Sovereign Stone (role-playing game)|Sovereign Stone]]'' roleplaying game written by Don Perrin and [[Lester W.

In addition to her writing career, Margaret serves as the owner and chief officer of two publishing companies, including [[Sovereign Press (role-playing game publisher)|Sovereign Press, Inc.]], a game publisher based in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.
