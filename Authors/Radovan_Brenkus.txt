== Creation ==
Brenkus is a continuator of literary [[modernism]]. In the field of poetry, he observes, analyses and decrypts the chaotic tired world, denounces the prevailing moral circumstances, the differences in its perception from without and within. The inspiratory sources are destructive emptiness, nothingness, limiting pseudo-being. By a symbology of [[pessimism]] and [[decadence]], he shows the loneliness of the individual, his more worsening condition and uncertain future.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mikulášek|first=Alexej|title=Modernism redivivus?|journal=Obrys-Kmen|volume=2003|issue=18|location=Praha|publisher=Union of the Czech Writers|issn=1210-1494|language=Czech}}</ref>

The motive of his prose is a search for the meaning of existence, awareness of transience, death. Among other things, Brenkus writes in neo-romantic style, as well as criticizes [[existentialism]] and the [[civilization]] [[progress (history)|progress]] which forces a human to find his own survival instinct. Surrealistic characters in author's stories are torn between the ideal and the real, and disturb an accepted order. Through expressive and mystical [[symbol]]ism, dramatic and grotesque scenes, Brenkus displays rebellion against [[elitism]] and decline of contemporary society. He provides a space for [[catharsis]] in the condensed and equally distinctive characteristics of the situations and characters.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mikulášek|first=Alexej|title=Brenkusiada ex inferno or "Somebody else is in the same situation"|journal=Dotyky|volume=2006|issue=3–4|location=Bratislava|publisher=Slovak Writers' Society|issn=1210-2210|language=Slovak}}</ref>
