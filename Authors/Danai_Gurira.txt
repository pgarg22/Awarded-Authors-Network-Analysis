Gurira interviewed more than 30 women who had been raped, among whose daughters that had been taken by rebel fighters and turned into sex slaves. She also spoke to female peace activists who were instrumental in ending the violence. The names of the women in ''Eclipsed'' come from the people Gurira met during her travels, whereas the fifth character is unnamed.<ref name="NPR-Eclipsed-2009">{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=112636506|title='Eclipsed' Brings Story Of Liberian Civil War To Stage|last1=Ludden|first1=Jennifer|date=September 8, 2009|work=NPR|access-date=October 21, 2015}}</ref>
