'''Ernesto Cardenal Martínez''' (20 January 1925 – 1 March 2020) was a [[Nicaraguan]] [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] [[priest]], poet, and politician. He was a [[liberation theologian]] and the founder of the [[primitivism (art)|primitivist]] art community in the [[Solentiname Islands]], where he lived for more than ten years (1965–1977). A former member of the [[Nicaragua]]n [[Sandinista]]s, he was Nicaragua's minister of culture from 1979 to 1987. He was prohibited from administering the sacraments in 1984 by [[Pope John Paul II]], but rehabilitated by [[Pope Francis]] in 2019.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://elpais.com/internacional/2019/02/16/actualidad/1550357606_032304.html|newspaper=[[El País]]|author=Pablo Ordaz|title=Roma se reconcilia con Cardenal|date=17 February 2019}}</ref>

==Early life==
Cardenal was born into an upper-class family in [[Granada, Nicaragua]]. He studied at [[Colegio Centro América|Colegio Centro America]] in Nicaragua. One of his brothers was fellow priest [[Fernando Cardenal]]. A first cousin of the poet [[Pablo Antonio Cuadra]], Cardenal studied literature in [[Managua]] and then from 1942 to 1946 in [[Mexico]] and from 1947 to 1949 in [[New York City]]. In 1949 and 1950, he traveled through [[Italy]], [[Spain]] and [[Switzerland]].

In July 1950, he returned to Nicaragua, where he participated in the 1954 April Revolution against [[Anastasio Somoza García]]'s regime. The coup d'état failed and ended with the deaths of many of his associates. After a deep mystical experience that Cardenal had on June,2, 1956,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cardenal|first=Ernesto |title=Vida perdida|date=1999|publisher=Seix Barral|isbn=84-322-0832-9|edition=1st |location=Barcelona|pages=89–92|language=es|oclc=43498484}}</ref> in 1957 he entered the [[Trappist]] [[The Abbey of Our Lady of Gethsemani|Monastery of Gethsemani]] ([[Kentucky]], [[United States]]), joining another poet-priest, [[Thomas Merton]], who was the master of novices; but in 1959, he left to study [[theology]] in [[Cuernavaca]], [[Mexico]].

==Priesthood==
Cardenal was ordained a Catholic priest in 1965 in Granada.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.curbstone.org/authdetail.cfm?AuthID=39|title=curbstone.org|website=www.curbstone.org|access-date=20 April 2017}}</ref> He went to the [[Solentiname Islands]], where he founded a Christian, almost-monastic, mainly-peasant community, which eventually led to the founding of the artists' colony. The colony engaged with painting as well as sculpture and was visited many times by artists and writers of the region such as [[Willarson Brandt]], [[Julio Cortázar]], [[Asilia Guillén]], and [[Aedes Margarita]]. It was there that the famous book ''[[The Gospel of Solentiname|El Evangelio en Solentiname]]'' (''[[The Gospel in Solentiname]]'') was written. Cardenal collaborated closely with the [[leftist]] [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Frente Sandinista de Liberación Nacional]] (Sandinista National Liberation Front, or FSLN) in working to overthrow [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]]'s regime.

==Nicaraguan Revolution==
Many members of the Solentiname community engaged in the revolutionary process through guerrilla warfare that the FSLN had developed to strike at the regime. The year 1977 was crucial to Cardenal's community, when Somoza's [[Guardia Nacional (Nicaragua)|National Guard]], as a result of an attack to the headquarters stationed in the city of [[San Carlos, Río San Juan|San Carlos]] a few kilometres from the community, raided Solentiname and burned it to the ground. Cardenal fled to [[Costa Rica]].

[[File:ErnestoCardenal2001.jpg|thumb|Cardenal in [[Managua]] in 2001]]
On 19 July 1979, immediately after the [[Nicaraguan Revolution|Liberation of Managua]], he was named Minister of Culture by the new Sandinista government. He campaigned for a "revolution without vengeance."<ref>''[https://www.google.com/#hl=en&gs_rn=1&gs_ri=hp&cp=39&gs_id=1s&xhr=t&q=Ernesto+Cardenal+80+Berliner+Morgenpost&es_nrs=true&pf=p&sclient=psy-ab&tbo=d&oq=Ernesto+Cardenal+80+Berliner+Morgenpost&gs_l=&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&bvm=bv.41248874,d.d2k&fp=e58b2ac11e131ec1&biw=1680&bih=939 "Revolution ohne Rache" in: Ernesto Cardenal 80].'' In: ''[[Berliner Morgenpost]]'', 10 June 2008. Retrieved, 23 January 2013.</ref> His brother [[Fernando Cardenal]], also a Catholic priest (in the [[Jesuit order]]), was appointed Minister of Education. When [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Nicaragua in 1983, he openly scolded Ernesto Cardenal, who knelt before him on the Managua airport runway, for resisting his order to resign from the government, and admonished him: "Usted tiene que arreglar sus asuntos con la Iglesia" ("You must fix your affairs with the Church"). On 4 February 1984 Pope John Paul II suspended Cardenal ''a divinis'' because of Cardenal's refusal to leave his political office.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.envio.org.ni/articulo/462|title=Revista Envío - Dos modelos de Iglesia (agosto 84 - julio 85)|website=www.envio.org.ni|access-date=20 April 2017}}</ref> This suspension remained in effect until it was lifted by Pope Francis in 2019. Cardenal remained Minister of Culture until 1987, when his ministry was closed for economic reasons.

==Later career==
Cardenal left the FSLN in 1994, protesting the [[authoritarian]] direction of the party under [[Daniel Ortega]], calling it a "robbery of the people and dictatorship not a revolutionary movement" when he left the government.<ref name=wp26052011>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/ernesto-cardenal-poet-and-catholic-priest-still-causes-controversy-at-age-86/2011/05/26/AGSok0EH_story.html|title=Ernesto Cardenal, poet and Catholic priest, still causes controversy at age 86|first=Manuel |last=Roig-Franzia|date=26 May 2011|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|access-date=21 November 2016}}</ref> He was a member of the [[Movimiento de Renovación Sandinista]] (Sandinista Renovation Movement, or MRS) that participated in the 2006 Nicaraguan general election. Days before the election, Cardenal explained his decision: "I think more desirable an authentic capitalism, as Montealegre's [<nowiki/>[[Eduardo Montealegre]], the presidential candidate for [[Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance]]] would be, than a false Revolution."<ref>{{cite news |title=Ernesto Cardenal prefiere que gane Montealegre | work=La Prensa |date=2 November 2006 | language = es |url=http://www-ni.laprensa.com.ni/archivo/2006/noviembre/02/noticias/ultimahora/153819.shtml |access-date=28 January 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080205080449/http://www-ni.laprensa.com.ni/archivo/2006/noviembre/02/noticias/ultimahora/153819.shtml |archive-date=5 February 2008 }}</ref>

He was also a member of the board of advisers of the [[Latin America]]n television station [[teleSUR]].

Cardenal was a polemical figure in Nicaragua's literary and cultural history. He has been described as "the most important poet right now in Latin America"<ref>{{cite news |author=Isolda Rodriguez Rosales |date=16 June 2007|title=Enfoque a la Poesía de salomon de la selva | work=La Prensa | language = es |url=http://www.laprensa.com.ni/archivo/2007/agosto/26/noticias/enfoque/ |url-access=subscription }}</ref> politically and poetically. He was a vocal representative for Nicaragua and a key to understanding the contemporary literary and cultural life of Nicaragua. He participated in the [[Stock Exchange of Visions]] project in 2007. During a short visit to [[India]], he made a profound impression on a group of writers called the [[Hungry generation]].

Cardenal's tour of the United States in 2011 to promote his newest work stirred up some controversy, as with the [[American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and Property]] that protested his appearances at Catholic schools such as [[Xavier University]] in [[Cincinnati|Cincinnati, Ohio]], because of his Marxist ideology.<ref name=wp26052011/>

On 18 February 2019, Archbishop [[Waldemar Stanisław Sommertag|Waldemar Sommertag]], the Vatican nuncio in Nicaragua, announced that Pope Francis had ended Cardenal's suspension and that Cardenal was "granted with benevolence the absolution of all canonical censures".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://cruxnow.com/church-in-the-americas/2019/02/18/pope-lifts-suspension-imposed-on-nicaraguan-priest-34-years-ago/|title=Pope lifts suspension imposed on Nicaraguan priest 34 years ago|author=Cindy Wooden, Catholic News Service|publisher=Crux Now|date=18 February 2019|access-date=19 February 2019}}</ref> His return to ministry was also confirmed by Managua Auxiliary Bishop [[Silvio Báez]], who stated “I visited my friend priest, Father Ernesto Cardenal, in the hospital, with whom I could talk for a few minutes. After praying for him, I knelt in his bed and asked for his blessing as a priest of the Catholic Church, to which he agreed joyfully. Thank you, Ernesto! ”<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/ernesto-cardenal-nicaraguan-poet-and-priest-dies-at-95/2020/03/01/74e16728-5c09-11ea-ac50-18701e14e06d_story.html</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.clarin.com/mundo/ernesto-cardenal-historia-foto-rechazo-papa-juan-pablo-ii_0_phpJ10Ab.html|title=Ernesto Cardenal y la historia de la foto cuando lo rechazó el papa Juan Pablo II|date=March 2020}}</ref>

On 1 March 2020, Cardenal died due to complications from ongoing heart and kidney problems.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/01/world/americas/ernesto-cardenal-dead.html|title=Ernesto Cardenal, Nicaraguan Priest, Poet and Revolutionary, Dies at 95|first=Elias E.|last=Lopez|work=New York Times|date=1 March 2020|access-date=1 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.laprensa.com.ni/2020/03/01/cultura/2524112-muere-ernesto-cardenal-a-los-94-anos-el-poeta-de-hispanoamerica | access-date = 3 March 2020 |date=1 March 2020 | title= Muere Ernesto Cardenal a los 95 años, el poeta de Hispanoamérica| language = es }}</ref> His funeral was held in the [[Managua Cathedral]] on March 3, 2020, and was disrupted by at least 100 pro-Ortega protestors who shouted "viva Daniel" and "traitor" at his Nicaraguan flag-draped casket.<ref name=flagdraped /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://elpais.com/internacional/2020-03-03/ortega-despliega-fuerzas-policiales-en-el-velatorio-del-poeta-nicaraguense-ernesto-cardenal.html|title = Simpatizantes de Ortega invaden el funeral del poeta Ernesto Cardenal para gritarle "traidor"|date = 3 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=45461|title = Nicaraguan government backers disrupt funeral of Father Cardenal &#124; News Headlines}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.archyde.com/ortega-supporters-break-into-the-funeral-of-ernesto-cardenal-to-shout-traitor-to-the-coffin/|title = Ortega supporters break into the funeral of Ernesto Cardenal to shout "traitor!" to the coffin|date = 4 March 2020}}</ref> To avoid further harassment, Cardenal's burial was held in secret.<ref name=burial /> At his request, Cardenal's remains were [[cremated]] and then buried in the community he founded on the [[Solentiname Islands]].<ref name=burial>{{Cite web|url=https://havanatimes.org/features/solentinames-last-supper-with-ernesto-cardenal/|title = Solentiname's Last Supper with Ernesto Cardenal|date = 9 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aawsat.com/node/2167761|title = View of the monument where the remains of Nicaraguan priest, poet and writer Ernesto Cardenal were buried in Solentiname, Nicaragua 06 March 2020.EPA}}</ref><ref name=flagdraped>https://www.ft.com/content/22638be4-5f8c-11ea-8033-fa40a0d65a98</ref>

== Poetry ==
Earlier works were focused on life and love; however, some works like "Zero Hour" had a direct correlation to his Marxist political ideas, being tied to the assassination of guerrilla leader [[Augusto César Sandino]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poets/detail/ernesto-cardenal|title=Ernesto Cardenal|date=20 November 2016|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|access-date=21 November 2016}}</ref> Cardenal's poetry also was heavily influenced by his unique Catholic ideology, mainly [[liberation theology]]. Some of his latest works are heavily influenced by his understanding of science and evolution, though it is still in dialogue with his earlier Marxist and Catholic material.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/ernesto-cardenal-poet-and-catholic-priest-still-causes-controversy-at-age-86/2011/05/26/AGSok0EH_story.html|title=Ernesto Cardenal, poet and Catholic priest, still causes controversy at age 86|last={{!}}|first=Manuel Roig-Franzia|date=26 May 2011|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=21 November 2016}}</ref>  Cardenal sums up his later material in a ''[[PBS NewsHour]]'' interview:
{{quote|In the first place, one matures, and can write about things one couldn't before. One couldn't get poetry out of this theme or this situation. And later, you can do it because you have more technical ability to do it. Now I can do easily things that were impossible for me to do when I was younger. That also happens to painters, I guess, and to all artists and creators. Even politicians mature and become, perhaps, more astute or more cunning.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poets/detail/ernesto-cardenal|title=Ernesto Cardenal|date=21 November 2016|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en-us|access-date=21 November 2016}}</ref>}}
