'''John Webster''' (c. 1580 – c. 1632) was an English [[English literature#Jacobean period (1603–1625)|Jacobean]] [[dramatist]] best known for his tragedies ''[[The White Devil]]'' and ''[[The Duchess of Malfi]]'', which are often seen as masterpieces of the early 17th-century English stage.<ref name="SBTW">{{Cite book |last=Forker |first=Charles |title=Skull Beneath the Skin |url=https://archive.org/details/skullbeneathskin0000fork |url-access=registration |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press| year=1995 |location=Carbondale |isbn=978-0-8093-1279-5}}</ref> His life and career overlapped [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s.

==Biography==
Webster's life is obscure and the dates of his birth and death are not known. His father, a carriage maker also named John Webster, married a blacksmith's daughter named Elizabeth Coates on 4 November 1577 and it is likely that Webster was born not long after, in or near London. The family lived in St Sepulchre's parish. His father John and uncle Edward were Freemen of the [[Merchant Taylors' Company]] and Webster attended Merchant Taylors' School in Suffolk Lane, London.<ref>"John Webster also attended the school, though probably after Mulcaster's retirement in 1586", Julia Briggs, ''This Stage Play World – Texts & Contexts 1580–1625'', OUP, p. 196.</ref> On 1 August 1598, "John Webster, lately of the New Inn" was admitted to the [[Middle Temple]], one of the Inns of Court; in view of the legal interests evident in his dramatic work, this may be the playwright.<ref name="continuum">{{Cite book |last=Serafin |first=Steven |author2=Myer, Valerie Grosvenor |title=The Continuum Encyclopedia of British Literature |publisher=Continuum |year=2003 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/continuumencyclo0000unse/page/1032 1032] |isbn=0-8264-1456-7 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/continuumencyclo0000unse}}</ref> Webster married 17-year-old Sara Peniall on 18 March 1605 at [[St Mary's Church, Islington]].<ref>Rene Weis, editor of ''John Webster: The Duchess of Malfi and Other Plays'' (Oxford World's Classics, 1996) in programme notes for ''The Duchess of Malfi'', The Old Vic, spring 2012</ref> A special licence had to be obtained to permit a wedding in [[Lent]], which was necessary as Sara was seven months pregnant.

Forker (1986) [[Southern Illinois University Press]]; p. 7.</ref> Bequests in the will of a neighbour who died in 1617, indicate that other children were born to him.

Most of what is otherwise known of him relates to his theatrical activities. Webster was still writing plays in the mid-1620s, but [[Thomas Heywood]]'s ''Hierarchie of the Blessed Angels'' (licensed 7 November 1634) speaks of him in the past tense, implying he was then dead.

There is no known portrait of Webster.

===Early collaboration ===
By 1602, Webster was working with teams of playwrights on history plays, most of which were never printed. These included a tragedy ''Caesar's Fall'' (written with [[Michael Drayton]], [[Thomas Dekker (poet)|Thomas Dekker]], [[Thomas Middleton]] and [[Anthony Munday]]) and a collaboration with [[Thomas Dekker (poet)|Thomas Dekker]] ''Christmas Comes but Once a Year'' (1602).<ref name=webworks>{{Cite book |last=Webster |first=John |author2=Gunby, David |author3=Carnegie, David |author4= MacDonald P Jackson |title=The Works of John Webster |edition=An Old-Spelling Critical |location=Cambridge |publisher=University Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-521-26061-9}}</ref> With Dekker he also wrote [[Sir Thomas Wyatt (play)|''Sir Thomas Wyatt'']], which was printed in 1607 and probably first performed in 1602. He worked with Thomas Dekker again on two [[city comedy|city comedies]], [[Westward Ho (play)|''Westward Ho'']] in 1604 and ''[[Northward Ho]]'' in 1605. Also in 1604, he adapted [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]]'s ''[[The Malcontent]]'' for staging by the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]].

===The major tragedies===
[[File:Duchess of Malfi title page.jpg|thumb|Title page of ''[[The Duchess of Malfi]]'', 1623]]
Despite his ability to write comedy, Webster is best known for two brooding English tragedies based on Italian sources. ''[[The White Devil]]'', a retelling of the intrigues involving [[Vittoria Accoramboni]], an Italian woman assassinated at the age of 28, was a failure when staged at the [[Red Bull Theatre]] in 1612 (published the same year) being too unusual and intellectual for its audience. ''[[The Duchess of Malfi]]'', first performed by the King's Men about 1614 and published nine years later, was more successful. He also wrote a play called ''Guise'', based on French history, of which little else is known, as no text has survived.<ref name=webworks/>

''The White Devil'' was performed in the [[Red Bull Theatre]], an open-air theatre that is believed to have specialised in providing simple, escapist drama for a largely working class audience, a factor that might explain why Webster's highly intellectual and complex play was unpopular with its audience. In contrast, ''The Duchess of Malfi'' was probably performed by [[the King's Men]] in the smaller, indoor [[Blackfriars Theatre]], where it would have played to a better educated audience that might have appreciated it better. The two plays would thus have been very different in their original performances. ''The White Devil'' would have been performed by adult actors, probably in continuous action, with elaborate stage effects a possibility. ''The Duchess of Malfi'' was performed in a controlled environment, with artificial lighting and musical interludes between acts, which allowed time, perhaps, for the audience to accept the otherwise strange rapidity with which the Duchess is able to have babies.

===Late plays===
Webster wrote one more play on his own: ''[[The Devil's Law Case]]'' ({{circa|1617}}–{{circa|1619}}), a [[tragicomedy]]. His later plays were collaborative [[city comedy|city comedies]]: ''[[Anything for a Quiet Life]]'' ({{circa|1621}}) co-written with [[Thomas Middleton]] and ''[[A Cure for a Cuckold]]'' ({{circa|1624}}) co-written with [[William Rowley]]. In 1624, he also co-wrote a topical play about a recent scandal, ''[[Keep the Widow Waking]]'' (with [[John Ford (dramatist)|John Ford]], Rowley and Dekker).<ref name=webworks /> The play is lost, although its plot is known from a court case. He is believed to have contributed to the tragicomedy ''[[The Fair Maid of the Inn]]'' with [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]], Ford and [[Phillip Massinger]]. His ''[[Appius and Virginia]]'', probably written with [[Thomas Heywood]], is of uncertain date.

==Reputation==
Intricate, complex, subtle and learned, Webster's plays are difficult but rewarding and are still frequently staged. Webster has received a reputation for being the Elizabethan and Jacobean dramatist with the most unsparingly dark vision of human nature. Even more than [[John Ford (dramatist)|John Ford]], whose ''[['Tis Pity She's a Whore]]'' is also very bleak, Webster's tragedies present a horrific vision of humanity. In his poem "Whispers of Immortality", [[T. S. Eliot]] memorably says that Webster always saw "the skull beneath the skin".

Webster's title character in ''The Duchess of Malfi'' is presented as a figure of virtue by comparison to her malevolent brothers and in facing death she exemplifies classical [[Stoicism|Stoic]] courage. Her martyr-like death scene has been compared to that of the titular king in [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s play ''[[Edward II (play)|Edward II]]''. Webster's use of a strong, virtuous woman as his central character was rare for his time and represents a deliberate reworking of some of the original historical event on which his play was based. The character of the duchess recalls the Victorian poet and essayist [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]]'s comment in ''A Study of Shakespeare'' that in tragedies such as ''[[King Lear]]'' Shakespeare had shown such a bleak world as a foil or backdrop for virtuous heroines such as Ophelia and Imogen, so that their characterisation would not seem too incredible. Swinburne describes such heroines as shining in the darkness.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Webster's drama was generally dismissed in the 18th and 19th centuries but many 20th-century critics and theatregoers have found ''The White Devil'' and ''The Duchess of Malfi'' brilliant plays of great poetic quality and dark themes. One explanation for the change is that only after the horrors of war in the early 20th century could their desperate protagonists be portrayed on stage again and understood. W. A. Edwards wrote of Webster's plays in ''Scrutiny'' II (1933–1934) "Events are not within control, nor are our human desires; let's snatch what comes and clutch it, fight our way out of tight corners, and meet the end without squealing." The violence and pessimism of Webster's tragedies have seemed to some analysts close to modern sensibilities.<ref name="RER001">{{Cite book |last=Fernie |first=Ewan |last2=Wray |first2=Ramona |last3=Thornton Burnett |first3=Mark |last4=McManus |first4=Clare |title=Reconceiving the Renaissance: A Critical Reader |url=https://archive.org/details/reconceivingrena00fern |url-access=limited |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=31 March 2005 |location=[[Oxford]] |pages=[https://archive.org/details/reconceivingrena00fern/page/n175 163] |isbn=0-19-926557-7}}</ref>

==Webster in other works==
*The 18th-century play ''The Fatal Secret'' by [[Lewis Theobald]] is a reworking of ''The Duchess of Malfi'', imposing [[Aristotle]]'s [[Classical unities|'unities']] and a happy ending on the plot.
*The short story 'A Christmas in Padua' in [[F. L. Lucas]]'s ''The Woman Clothed with the Sun'' (1937) retells the final hours in December 1585 of Vittoria Accoramboni (the original of Webster's ''White Devil''), slanting the narrative from her perspective.
*The 1982 [[detective novel]] ''[[The Skull Beneath the Skin]]'' by [[P. D. James]] centres on an ageing actress who plans to play Webster's drama ''[[The Duchess of Malfi]]'' in a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] castle theatre. The novel takes its title from [[T. S. Eliot]]'s famous characterisation of Webster's work in his poem 'Whispers of Immortality'.
*''[[Webster (play)|Webster]]'', a play by [[Robert David McDonald]], was written for and premièred at the [[Glasgow Citizens Theatre]], 1984.
*A young John Webster, played by [[Joe Roberts (English actor)|Joe Roberts]], appears in the 1998 film ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]''. When talking to Will Shakespeare he tells him, "When I write plays they'll be like Titus (Andronicus)... plenty of blood – that's the only writing." The scene alludes to the real John Webster's macabre work. He is also the character who reveals Viola's disguise, after watching Viola and Shakespeare making love in the theatre.
