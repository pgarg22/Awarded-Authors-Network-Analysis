'''Josip Murn''', also known under the pseudonym '''Aleksandrov''' (4 March 1879 &ndash; 18 June 1901) was a [[Slovene language|Slovene]] [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist]] [[poet]]. Together with [[Ivan Cankar]], [[Oton Župančič]], and [[Dragotin Kette]], he was regarded as one of the beginners of [[modernism]] in [[Slovene literature]].<ref>[http://www.murn-aleksandrov.net/slo/default.asp Josip Murn Aleksandrov<!-- bot-generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118113050/http://www.murn-aleksandrov.net/slo/default.asp|date=2008-01-18}} at www.murn-aleksandrov.net</ref> After [[France Prešeren]] and [[Edvard Kocbek]], Murn was probably the most influential Slovene poet of the last two centuries.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

== Life ==

Murn was born in a condominium in the very center of [[Ljubljana]] as an [[Illegitimacy|illegitimate son]] to a poor woman. His mother moved to [[Trieste]] soon after his birth, leaving him in [[fosterage|foster care]] to some relatives from the suburbs of Ljubljana.

As a teenager, he enrolled in the local high school, where he came in contact with other young [[Slovenes|Slovene]] literates, such as [[Ivan Cankar]], [[Dragotin Kette]], and [[Oton Župančič]], who experimented in new trends of European poetry, in particular Slovene ''Moderna'', a national literary trend that combined [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalism]], [[Impressionism]], [[Decadence]] and [[Symbolist]] ideas.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jbhJDwAAQBAJ&q=Josip+Murn+Aleksandrov&pg=PA370 |title = Historical Dictionary of Slovenia|isbn = 9781538111062|last1 = Plut-Pregelj|first1 = Leopoldina|last2 = Kranjc|first2 = Gregor|last3 = Lazarević|first3 = Žarko|last4 = Rogel|first4 = Carole|date = 2018-02-22}}</ref> He was a gifted student, shy, but also very self-confident. He started writing poetry at a very young age and soon achieved a very high level of quality. His talent was spotted by a high-class society woman Franja Tavčar, the influential wife of the [[Liberalism in Slovenia|national-liberal]] politician and author [[Ivan Tavčar]], who arranged for him a scholarship to study at the [[University of Vienna]].

In 1898 he moved to [[Vienna]], spending there a year mostly visiting literary cafés and art exhibitions. Strongly influenced by the [[Viennese Secession]], he wrote a series of poems with the common title ''Fin de siècle'', in which he delivered his impressions on the life in the [[metropolis]].

In 1899, he moved back home and started traveling around the [[Slovene Lands]]. He spent several months in [[Upper Carniola]], when he observed the peasant life style. He began to incorporate peasant motifs in his symbolist poetry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://litteraeslovenicae.si/knjiga/lonesome-poplar-tree-selected-poems/|title = Lonesome Poplar Tree: Selected Poems – Litterae slovenicae}}</ref> He took elements not only from Slovene, but also from [[Ireland|Irish]], [[Scotland|Scottish]], [[Slovaks|Slovak]], and [[Latvia]]n folk motifs.<ref>Josip Murn Aleksandrov, ''Izbrane pesmi'' (Ljubljana: Cankarjeva založba, 2007), 66-67, 98-101, 110-111</ref>

He later traveled to the [[Austrian Littoral]], visiting his mother in [[Trieste]] and living briefly in [[Grado, Italy|Grado]] before settling in the [[Vipava Valley]] for some time. There, he decided to adopt the pseudonym Aleksandrov, reminiscent of [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] peasant [[archaism]], and moved to an even more simple and [[impressionist]] poetic expression.

He settled in Ljubljana in 1901, renting a small room in a slum building on the banks of the river [[Ljubljanica]] (an abandoned sugar factory, known as ''[[Cukrarna]]''). He died there at the age of 22 from [[tuberculosis]], on the same bed as his friend [[Dragotin Kette]] just two years before.

He is buried in the [[Žale]] cemetery, next to the tombs of Dragotin Kette, Ivan Cankar and Oton Župančič, in what is known as the "monument of Slovene modernism" (''Spomenik slovenske moderne'').

== Reception ==

Murn remained mostly unacknowledged by contemporary critics. The doyen of 19th-century Slovene poetry, [[Anton Aškerc]] rejected him as a [[Decadent movement|decadent]]. Even some of his closest colleagues, namely [[Ivan Cankar|Cankar]] and [[Oton Župančič|Župančič]], did not look favorably on his poetic endeavor, regarding it as too symbolist, abstract, "anemic," and "non-lively." He did gain some recognition during his Vienna period, when his poems were published in established literary magazines such as ''[[Ljubljanski zvon]]'', but the later developments in his poetry did not receive a positive response by the public.

His fame came soon after his death. The literary critic, [[Ivan Prijatelj]], edited a volume of his collected poems in 1903, jointly with a brilliant essay which gained recognition both to Murn and to Prijatelj himself as a literary critic. Prijatelj's essay also influenced [[Oton Župančič]] to change his opinion on Murn's poetry; as an homage to his late friend, Župančič wrote the poem "Manom Josipa Murna Aleksandra" (To the [[Manes]] of Josip Murn, a.k.a. Aleksandrov). By the end of the decade, Murn was already firmly established in the Slovene literary canon, and considered a great influence on [[Intimism (poetic movement)|Intimism]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://litteraeslovenicae.si/avtorji/josip-murn-aleksandrov/|title = Josip Murn Aleksandrov – Litterae slovenicae}}</ref> and successive generations of poets, particularly  [[Alojz Gradnik]], [[Srečko Kosovel]], [[Miran Jarc]], [[France Balantič]], [[Edvard Kocbek]], [[Dane Zajc]], [[Niko Grafenauer]], and [[Jože Snoj]]. Snoj dedicated extensive studies to Murn's poetry.
