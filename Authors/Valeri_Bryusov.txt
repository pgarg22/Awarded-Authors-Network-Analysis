'''Valery Yakovlevich Bryusov''' ({{lang-rus|Вале́рий Я́ковлевич Брю́сов|p=vɐˈlʲerʲɪj ˈjakəvlʲɪvʲɪdʑ ˈbrʲusəf|a=Valyeriy Yakovlyevich Bryusov.ru.vorb.oga}}; {{OldStyleDate|13 December|1873|1 December}} – 9 October 1924) was a Russian poet, prose writer, dramatist, translator, critic and [[historian]].  He was one of the principal members of the [[Russian Symbolism|Russian Symbolist movement]].<ref name="ds">[[Darko Suvin]], "Bryusov,Valery"  in Curtis C. Smith, ''[[Twentieth-Century Science-Fiction Writers]]''. Chicago, St. James, 1986. {{ISBN|0912289279}} (pp. 840–41).</ref>

==Life==
{{expand section|date=July 2018}}
Valery Bryusov was born on 13 December 1873 (recorded as 1 December, according to the old [[Julian calendar]]) into a merchant's family in [[Moscow]]. His parents were educated for their class but had little do with his upbringing, and as a boy Bryusov was largely left to himself. He spent a great deal of time reading "everything that fell into [his] hands," including the works of [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Jules Verne]], as well as various materialistic and scientific essays. The future poet received an excellent education, studying in two Moscow [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]] between 1885 and 1893.

==Career==
Bryusov began his literary career in the early 1890s while still a student at [[Moscow State University]] with his translations of the poetry of the [[French Symbolists]] ([[Paul Verlaine]], [[Maurice Maeterlinck]], and [[Stéphane Mallarmé]]) as well at that of [[Edgar Allan Poe]].  Bryusov also began to publish his own poems, which were very much influenced by the [[Decadence|Decadent]] and [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist movements]] of his contemporary Europe. During this time Bryusov came under the influence of the philosopher [[Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov]] and the scientist [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]].<ref name="ds" />

At the time, Russian Symbolism was still mainly a set of theories and had few notable practitioners. Therefore, in order to represent Symbolism as a movement of formidable following, Bryusov adopted numerous [[pen name]]s and published three volumes of his own verse, entitled ''Russian Symbolists. An Anthology'' (1894–95). Bryusov's mystification proved successful – several young poets were attracted to Symbolism as the latest fashion in Russian letters.

With the appearance of ''Tertia Vigilia'' in 1900, he came to be revered by other Symbolists as an authority in matters of art. In 1904 he became the editor of the influential [[literary magazine]] ''[[Vesy]]'' (''The Balance''), which consolidated his position in the Russian literary world.  Bryusov's mature works were notable for their celebration of sensual pleasures as well as their mastery of a wide range of poetic forms, from the [[acrostic]] to the [[carmina figurata]].

By the 1910s, Bryusov's poetry had begun to seem cold and strained to many of his contemporaries.  As a result, his reputation gradually declined and, with it, his power in the Russian literary world.  He was adamantly opposed to the efforts of [[Georgy Chulkov]] and [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (poet)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]] to move Symbolism in the direction of [[Mystical Anarchism]].

Though many of his fellow Symbolists fled Russia after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], Bryusov remained until his death in 1924.  He supported the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] government and received a position in the cultural ministry of the new [[Soviet Union|Soviet state]]. Shortly before his death he was involved with [[Otto Schmidt]] in drawing up the proposal for the [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]].<ref name= Beginnings>{{cite web |url= http://www.prlib.ru/en-us/history/Pages/Item.aspx?itemid=812 |title= Beginning of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia issue |publisher= Boris Yeltsin Presidential Library |access-date= 2013-02-20 }}</ref>

In 1924, shortly before his death, Bryusov posed for the young sculptor {{Interlanguage link multi|Nina Niss-Goldman|ru|3=Нисс-Гольдман, Нина Ильинична}} (1893–1990). Now the portrait is in the [[Russian Museum]] of St. Petersburg in a collection of the work of [[Russian avant-garde]] artists.

==Literature==
Alongside [[Adelina Adalis]] (1900-1969) and [[Nikolay Gumilev]] (1986-1921), he was influenced by the [[Malaysian literature]] from the XIX and XX century.<ref>{{cite news |last=Zahari |first=Oleh Rahimidin |title=Jambatan muhibah Rusia - Malaysia |url=http://ww1.utusan.com.my/utusan/Sastera/20140824/sa_02/Jambatan-muhibah-Rusia---Malaysia |date=24 August 2014 |access-date=9 June 2018 |newspaper=[[Utusan Melayu]] |language=ru}}</ref>

===Prose===

Bryusov's most famous [[prose]] works are the historical novels ''The Altar of Victory'' (depicting life in Ancient Rome) and ''[[The Fiery Angel (novel)|The Fiery Angel]]'' (depicting the psychological climate of 16th century Germany). The latter tells the story of a knight's attempts to win the love of a young woman whose spiritual integrity is seriously undermined by her participation in occult practices and her dealings with unclean forces.  It served as the basis for [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s [[opera]] ''[[The Fiery Angel (opera)|The Fiery Angel]]''.

Bryusov also wrote some [[science fiction]] stories, under the influence of Poe, [[H.G. Wells]] and [[Camille Flammarion]]. Several of these, including the title story, were assembled in his collection ''The Republic of the Southern Cross''.<ref name="ds" /><ref>Gary Kern,''The Republic of the Southern Cross'', in [[Frank N. Magill]], ed. ''Survey of Science Fiction Literature'', Vol. 4. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Salem Press, 1979. (pp. 1768–1774). {{ISBN|0-89356-194-0}}</ref>

===Translation===

As a translator, Bryusov was the first to render the works of the Belgian poet [[Emile Verhaeren]] and the lyrics of Armenian ashugh [[Sayat-Nova]]<ref>{{cite journal |last= Hayryan|first=Zarui Gevorkovna |date=2016|title=Ашугская поэзия Саят-Новы в русских переводах|trans-title=Ashough Poetry by Sayat-Nova in Russia Translations|url=http://old.nauka-dialog.ru/en/arxiv/2016/nauchnyy-dialog-2016-3-51/10-01-00-literaturovedenie/ashough-poetry-by-sayat-nova-in-russia-translations.html|language=Ru|journal=Nauchnyy Dialog|volume=3(51)|issue=2016 |pages=132–145 |access-date=28 December 2020}}</ref> accessible to Russian readers. He was one of the major translators of [[Paul Verlaine]]'s poetry.

His most famous translations are of Edgar Allan Poe, [[Romain Rolland]], [[Maurice Maeterlinck]], [[Victor Hugo]], [[Jean Racine]], [[Ausonius]], [[Molière]], [[Byron]], and [[Oscar Wilde]]. Bryusov also translated [[Johann Goethe]]'s ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' and [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]''.
