'''Tevfik Kolaylı''' (March 24, 1879 &ndash; January 28, 1953), better known by his pen name '''Neyzen Tevfik''', was a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] poet, satirist, and ''neyzen'' (a "[[ney]] performer" in Turkish). He was born in [[Bodrum]] and died in [[Istanbul]]. His name is occasionally misspelled as Neyzen Teyfik.

==Biography==
Tevfik learned [[Persian language|Persian]] as a young man, and became a [[Mevlevi]] in [[İzmir]]. He then moved to Istanbul and continued his Mevlevi practice in [[Galata]] and [[Kasımpaşa (district)|Kasımpaşa]]. In 1902 he became a [[Bektashi]] [[dervish]].

His interest in poetry influenced him into meeting with [[Mehmet Akif Ersoy]]. As was the case with many other intellectuals of his period, Tevfik's satirical poetry critical of the conservative sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] resulted in his exile to [[Egypt]] in 1903,<ref name="Rogan2002">{{cite book|author=Eugene Rogan|title=Outside In: Marginality in the Modern Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I-mX31dOIs8C&pg=PA7|date=4 October 2002|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-86064-698-0|page=22}}</ref> which he later visited again between 1908 and 1913.

Neyzen Tevfik's fame in popular [[Turkish culture]] is mainly due to his virtuosity with the ney. Moreover, he was also a heavy drinker while practicing a form of [[Islam]] as it was common among Bektashis. He therefore is also a symbol of a clash between the orthodox Islamic doctrine, and the [[Bektashi]] order that he was in, as illustrated in the following translation of his writing:

{{quote|The disbeliever's book has neither beginning nor end. A few pages from its middle is all we ever grasp. For religion's sake and fear of blasphemy we endure woe. Reason cannot perceive where righteousness may go.<ref>http://www.neyzentevfik.org</ref>}}

His religious views were highly mixed and tend to change in accordance with his mood. Yet, in his last years, he wrote a poem "Türk'e Birinci Öğüt" (First counsel to the Turk) in which a verse, regarding religious institutions mentioned before the verse, says:

''"Varsa aslı bunların alemde siksinler beni."''

(If any of these are true, well, fuck me.)

Therefore he can be considered a radical, if not directly atheist or non-theistic.<ref>http://www.mbdincaslan.com/index.php/koseyazilari/item/41-neyzentevfik</ref>
