'''Frederick William Faber''' (28 June 1814&nbsp;– 26 September 1863) was a noted English [[hymn]] writer and theologian, who converted from [[Anglicanism]] to [[Roman Catholicism]] in 1845. He was ordained to the Catholic priesthood subsequently in 1847. His best-known work is ''[[Faith of Our Fathers (hymn)|Faith of Our Fathers]]''.

==Life==
===Early life===
Faber was born in 1814 at [[Calverley]], then within the [[Civil parishes in England|Parish]] of Calverley in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calverley.info/map.htm|work=Calverley|title=Calverley Parish Map|access-date=12 November 2012}}</ref> where his grandfather, Thomas Faber, was the [[Vicar (Anglicanism)|vicar]]. His uncle, the theologian [[George Stanley Faber]], had been a prolific author.

Faber attended grammar school at [[Bishop Auckland]] in [[County Durham]] for a short time, but a large portion of his boyhood was spent in [[Westmorland]]. He afterwards attended [[Harrow School|Harrow]] and [[Shrewsbury School|Shrewsbury]], followed by enrollment in 1832 at [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]] at the [[Oxford University|University of Oxford]]. In 1834, he obtained a scholarship at [[University College, Oxford|University College]], from which he graduated. In 1836 he won the [[Newdigate Prize]] for a poem on "The Knights of St John," which elicited special praise from [[John Keble]]. Among his college friends were [[Arthur Penrhyn Stanley]] and [[Roundell Palmer, 1st Earl of Selborne]]. After graduation he was elected a [[fellow#Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin|fellow]] of the college.

Faber's family was of [[Huguenot]] descent, and [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] beliefs were strongly held by them. When Faber had come to Oxford, he was exposed to the [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholic]] preaching of the [[Oxford Movement]] which was beginning to develop in the [[Church of England]]. One of its most prominent proponents was the popular preacher [[John Henry Newman]], vicar of the [[University Church of St Mary the Virgin]]. Faber struggled with these divergent forms of Christian beliefs and life. In order to relieve his tension, he would take long vacations in the [[Lake District]], where he would write poetry. There he was befriended by another poet, [[William Wordsworth]]. He finally abandoned the Calvinistic views of his youth and became an enthusiastic follower of Newman.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Faber|first1=Francis Atkinson|title=A brief sketch of the early life of the late F.W.

===An Anglican vicar===
Faber was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] in the [[Church of England]] in 1839, after which he spent time supporting himself as a tutor. 

In 1843, Faber accepted the position of  [[rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] at a church in [[Elton, Cambridgeshire|Elton]], then in [[Huntingdonshire]] but now in [[Cambridgeshire]]. His first act was to go to Rome to learn how best to carry out his pastoral charge. Faber introduced the Catholic practices of celebrating [[calendar of saints|feast days]], [[Confession (religion)|confession]] and the devotion of the [[Sacred Heart]] to the congregation. However, there was a strong [[Methodism|Methodist]] presence in the parish and the Dissidents packed his church each Sunday in an attempt to challenge the Roman Catholic direction he was taking the congregation in.


===A Catholic priest===
[[File:Frederick William Faber (H Hering NPG Ax46941).jpg|thumb|left|Frederick Faber circa 1860]]

Few people were surprised though when, after prolonged mental struggle, Faber left Elton to follow his hero Newman and join the Catholic Church, into which he was received in November 1845 by Bishop [[William Wareing]] of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Northampton|Northampton]]. He was accompanied in this step by eleven men of the small community which had formed around him in Elton. They settled in Birmingham, where they informally organized themselves in a religious community, calling themselves the Brothers of the Will of God.<ref name=SC>{{cite web|url=http://www.seattlecatholic.com/a060726.html|work=Seattle Catholic|title=Frederick William Faber|first=Alan|last=Frost|date=26 July 2006|access-date=12 November 2012}}</ref>

Faber and his small religious community were encouraged in their venture by the [[John Talbot, 16th Earl of Shrewsbury|Earl of Shrewsbury]], who gave them the use of [[Cotton College|Cotton Hall]] in [[Staffordshire]]. Within weeks they had begun construction on a new Church of St. Wilfrid, their patron saint, designed by the noted church architect, [[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|Pugin]], as well as on a school for the local children. All of this was for a region which had no other Catholics at that point, other than the household of the Earl. The exertions took their toll on Faber, who became so ill that he was not expected to live and was given the [[last rites]] of the church. He recovered, however, and was ordained a Catholic priest, celebrating his [[First Mass]] on 4 April 1847. In the course of his illness Faber had developed a strong devotion to the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Blessed Mother]]. Prompted by this devotion, he translated St. [[Louis de Montfort]]'s classic work, ''[[True Devotion to Mary]]'', into English.<ref name=SC /><ref>''The Blessed Virgin Mary in England'' by Brother Anthony Josemaria 2008 {{ISBN|0-595-50074-9}} pages 173-175</ref>

===The Oratory===
Along with Newman, Faber felt drawn to the way of life of the [[Oratory of St Philip Neri]], with its  decentralized authority and greater freedom of life than in [[religious institute]]s.

The Earl, who had handsomely financed the construction of a new parish for the community, felt betrayed by such a quick departure. Additionally, the Wilfridians, as the Brothers were called, wished to wear a traditional religious habit, upsetting the old Catholic families who had survived centuries of persecution by keeping a low profile. Newman thus proposed that Faber's community settle somewhere other than Birmingham, and suggested London as the best option. Thus in 1849 a community of the Oratory was established in London in William IV Street.<ref name=Bowden>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05740c.htm Bowden, Henry Sebastian. "Frederick William Faber." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 28 Jun. 2014]</ref>

On 11 October 1850, the feast of St. Wilfrid, the community in London was established as autonomous, and Faber was elected its first [[provost (religion)|provost]], an office he held until his death. He took ill again, however, almost immediately, and was ordered by his physicians to travel to a warmer climate. He attempted a trip to the [[Holy Land]] but had to turn back, and instead toured Malta and Italy. The community still lacked a permanent home, and in September 1852 a location was chosen at [[Brompton Oratory|Brompton]]. The Oratorians proceeded with construction despite public protests at their presence.<ref name=SC />

===Last years===
Faber had never enjoyed good health. He had suffered from illness for years, developing what was eventually diagnosed as [[Bright's Disease]], which was to prove fatal. In spite of his weak health, much work was crowded into those years. He published a number of theological works, and edited the ''Oratorian Lives of the Saints''.<ref>''The Encyclopædia Britannica'' (1910) entry for Frederick William Faber</ref>

Faber died on 26 November, his funeral was on 30 November 1863 and he was buried in the cemetery of St Mary's Sydenham (then in Kent), which was the Brompton Oratory's retreat house. In 1952 Faber's remains were re-interred in the Brompton Oratory London, when St Mary's was requisitioned by the London County Council. Elizabeth Bowden had given St Wilfrid's chapel at the Oratory, in memory of Faber, as in life he had a great devotion to St Wilfrid. He took the name of the saint when he entered the Oratory and chose St Wilfrid's feast for the formal foundation of the London house. His remains were laid in a vault in front of the altar and a marble slab and inscription cover the vault.

Faber was the great-uncle of [[Geoffrey Faber]], co-founder of the publishing house "Faber and Gwyer" which later became "[[Faber and Faber]]", a major publisher of both literary and religious works.<ref>Biographical note on Geoffrey Faber on jacket of his book ''Oxford Apostles'' published by Penguin Books 1954 edition</ref>

Faber published hymnals titled 'Jesus and Mary' (1849) which contained considerable deep insights into Marian Theology. Faber was par excellence a Catholic writer who corrected protestant ideas of 'automatic' salvation of the Christian by Christ's death (as evidenced by 'O Turn to Jesus, Mother turn') and the idea of Mary as being a mere character in the Christian story (as evidenced by 'Mother of Mercy, Day by Day').

Faber was a supporter of congregational singing and wrote his hymns in an age when the English, in general, were slowly moving back to congregational singing after the strictness of low-church anglicanism. So Faber, as a Catholic, expanded the church's hymns that were suitable for congregational singing and encouraged the practice.<ref>[http://www.hymntime.com/tch/bio/f/a/b/faber_fw.htm] Hymntime website. Accessed 18 August 2010.</ref><blockquote>We must remember that if all the manifestly good men were on one side and all the manifestly bad men on the other, there would be no danger of anyone, least of all the elect, being deceived by lying wonders.  It is the good men, good once, we must hope good still, who are to do the work of Anti-Christ and so sadly to crucify the Lord afresh…. Bear in mind this feature of the last days, that this deceitfulness arises from good men being on the wrong side.
