'''Herman Wouk''' ({{IPAc-en|w|oʊ|k}} {{respell|WOHK}}; May 27, 1915 – May 17, 2019) was an American author best known for [[historical fiction]] such as ''[[The Caine Mutiny]]'' (1951) which won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction|Pulitzer Prize]].

His other major works include ''[[The Winds of War]]'' and ''[[War and Remembrance]]'', historical novels about [[World War II]], and non-fiction such as ''[[This Is My God]]'', an explanation of [[Judaism]] from a [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] perspective, written for [[Jews|Jewish]] and non-Jewish audiences. His books have been translated into 27 languages.<ref name=birthday>{{Cite news|last=Fessier|first=Bruce|title=Herman Wouk, dean of historical novelists, turns 100|url=http://www.desertsun.com/story/life/entertainment/people/brucefessierentertainment/2015/05/26/herman-wouk-dean-historical-novelists-turns/27990017/|work=[[The Desert Sun]]|date=May 26, 2015|access-date=August 5, 2015}}</ref>

''[[The Washington Post]]'' called Wouk, who cherished his privacy, "the reclusive dean of American historical novelists".<ref name=birthday /> Historians, novelists, publishers, and critics who gathered at the [[Library of Congress]] in 1995 to mark Wouk's 80th birthday described him as an American [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]].<ref name=tolstoy>{{Cite news|last=Ringle|first=Ken|title=Fiction's Truest Voice|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1995/05/16/fictions-truest-voice/f39cd3bb-f5cf-45c9-8273-a815b8be4e5b/|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=May 16, 1995|access-date=August 5, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002010411/http://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1995/05/16/fictions-truest-voice/f39cd3bb-f5cf-45c9-8273-a815b8be4e5b/|archive-date=October 2, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Early life==
Wouk was born in [[the Bronx]], the second of three children born to Esther (née Levine) and Abraham Isaac Wouk, Russian [[Judaism|Jewish]] immigrants from what is today [[Belarus]]. His father toiled for many years to raise the family out of poverty before opening a successful laundry service.<ref>{{cite book |first=Sean |last=Callery |url=https://archive.org/details/victorwoukfather0000call |url-access=registration |title=Victor Wouk: The Father of the Hybrid Car |publisher=Crabtree Publishing Company |year=2009 |page=[https://archive.org/details/victorwoukfather0000call/page/7 7]}}</ref>

When Wouk was 13, his maternal grandfather, Mendel Leib Levine, came from [[Minsk]] to live with them and took charge of his grandson's Jewish education. Wouk was frustrated by the amount of time he was expected to study the [[Talmud]], but his father told him, "if I were on my deathbed, and I had breath to say one more thing to you, I would say 'Study the Talmud.'" Eventually Wouk took this advice to heart. After a brief period as a young adult during which he lived a secular life, he returned to religious practice.<ref name=bt>{{Cite web|last=Quarles|first=Philip|title=Herman Wouk Bucks Literary Trends to Produce Best-Selling Novels|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/216856-herman-wouk/|publisher=WNYC|date=January 25, 2013|access-date=August 5, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414112629/http://www.wnyc.org/story/216856-herman-wouk/|archive-date=April 14, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Judaism would become integral to both his personal life and his career.<ref name=bio>{{Cite web|title=Herman Wouk Biography|url=http://www.biography.com/people/herman-wouk-20631823|publisher=Biography.com|access-date=August 4, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150816060411/http://www.biography.com/people/herman-wouk-20631823|archive-date=August 16, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> He would later say that his grandfather and the [[United States Navy]] were the two most important influences on his life.<ref name=influences>{{Cite book|last1=Shatzky|first1=Joel|last2=Taub|first2=Michael|title=Contemporary Jewish-American Novelists: A Bio-critical Sourcebook|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|date=1997}}</ref>

After his childhood and adolescence in the Bronx and a diploma from the original [[Townsend Harris High School]] in [[Manhattan]], he earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree at the age of 19 from [[Columbia University]] in 1934, where he was a member of the [[Pi Lambda Phi]] fraternity.<ref name="2010directory">Membership Directory, 2010, Pi Lambda Phi Inc.</ref> He also served as editor of the university's humor magazine, [[Jester of Columbia|''Jester'']], and wrote two of its annual [[Varsity Show]]s.<ref name=columbia>{{Cite web|title=Herman Wouk Biography|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/herman-wouk|publisher=eNotes.com|access-date=August 4, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924051508/http://www.enotes.com/topics/herman-wouk|archive-date=September 24, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Soon thereafter, he became a radio dramatist, working in [[David Freedman]]'s "Joke Factory" and later with [[Fred Allen]] for five years<ref name=loc>{{Cite web|last=D'Odge|first=Craig|title=Herman Wouk Makes His Case|url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/0012/words_wouck.html|date=December 2000|publisher=Library of Congress|access-date=August 4, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019094332/http://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/0012/words_wouck.html|archive-date=October 19, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> and then, in 1941, for the United States government, writing radio spots to sell [[war bond]]s.<ref name=warbonds>{{Cite web|last=French|first=Yvonne|title=Herman Wouk Donates Five Historical Novels|url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/9514/wouk.html|date=July 10, 1995|publisher=Library of Congress|access-date=August 4, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525233740/http://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/9514/wouk.html|archive-date=May 25, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Career==
===Military career===
Following the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], Wouk joined the [[United States Navy Reserve|U.S. Naval Reserve]] in 1942 and served in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Theater]] during [[World War II]], an experience he later characterized as educational: "I learned about machinery, I learned how men behaved under pressure, and I learned about Americans." Wouk served as an officer aboard two destroyer [[minesweeper]]s (DMS), the [[USS Zane (DD-337)|USS ''Zane'']] and [[USS Southard (DD-207)|USS ''Southard'']], becoming [[executive officer#United States Navy and United States Coast Guard|executive officer]] of the latter while holding the rank of [[Lieutenant (navy)|lieutenant]]. He participated in around six invasions and won a number of [[Service star|battle stars]].<ref name=loc /> Wouk was in the [[New Georgia Campaign]], the [[Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign]], the [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign]], and the [[Battle of Okinawa]].<ref>Wouk was not at the Battle of Lingayen Gulf, though his ship Southard was.

===Writing career===
His second novel, ''[[City Boy: The Adventures of Herbie Bookbinder|City Boy]]'', proved to be a commercial disappointment at the time of its initial publication in 1948; Wouk once claimed{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} it was largely ignored amid the excitement over [[Norman Mailer]]'s bestselling World War II novel ''[[The Naked and the Dead]]''.

While writing his next novel, Wouk read each chapter to his wife as it was completed. At one point she remarked that if they did not like this one, he had better take up another line of work (a line he would give to the character of the editor Jeannie Fry in his novel ''[[Youngblood Hawke]]'', 1962). The novel, ''[[The Caine Mutiny]]'' (1951), went on to win the [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]]. A best-seller, drawing from his wartime experiences aboard minesweepers during World War II, ''The Caine Mutiny'' was adapted by the author into a [[Theater District, Manhattan|Broadway]] play called ''[[The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial]]'' and, in 1954, [[Columbia Pictures]] released a film version with [[Humphrey Bogart]] portraying Lt. Commander Philip Francis Queeg, captain of the fictional USS ''Caine''.<ref name=guardian>{{Cite news|last=Armistead|first=Claire|title=Herman Wouk to publish first memoir aged 100|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/27/herman-wouk-memoir-100-sailor-and-fiddler|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=Kings Place, London|date=May 27, 2015|access-date=August 4, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150814144713/http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/27/herman-wouk-memoir-100-sailor-and-fiddler|archive-date=August 14, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

His first novel after ''The Caine Mutiny'' was ''[[Marjorie Morningstar (novel)|Marjorie Morningstar]]'' (1955), which earned him a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine cover story. Three years later [[Warner Bros.]] made it into a movie starring [[Natalie Wood]], [[Gene Kelly]] and [[Claire Trevor]]. His next novel, a [[paperback]], was ''[[Slattery's Hurricane]]'' (1956), which he had written in 1948 as the basis for the screenplay for the film of the same name. Wouk's first work of non-fiction was 1959's ''This is My God: The Jewish Way of Life''.<ref name="Homberger"/>

In the 1960s, he authored ''[[Youngblood Hawke]]'' (1962), a drama about the rise and fall of a young writer modeled on the life of [[Thomas Wolfe]], and ''[[Don't Stop the Carnival (novel)|Don't Stop the Carnival]]'' (1965), a comedy about escaping mid-life crisis by moving to the [[Caribbean]] (loosely based on Wouk's own experience). ''Youngblood Hawke'' was serialized in ''[[McCall's]]'' magazine from March to July 1962. A movie version starred [[James Franciscus]] and [[Suzanne Pleshette]] and was released by Warner Brothers in 1964. ''Don't Stop the Carnival'' was turned into a short-lived musical by [[Jimmy Buffett]] in 1997.<ref name="foxnews.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/herman-wouk-author-of-caine-mutiny-winds-of-war-dead|title=Herman Wouk, author of 'Caine Mutiny,' 'Winds of War,' dead at 103|date=May 17, 2019|publisher=Fox News|agency=Associated Press|access-date=May 18, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190518010340/https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/herman-wouk-author-of-caine-mutiny-winds-of-war-dead|archive-date=May 18, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the 1970s, Wouk published two monumental novels, ''[[The Winds of War]]'' (1971) and its sequel, ''[[War and Remembrance]]'' (1978). He described the latter, which included a devastating depiction of [[the Holocaust]], as "the main tale I have to tell." Both were made into successful television miniseries, the first in 1983 and the second in 1988. Although they were made several years apart, both were directed by [[Dan Curtis]] and both starred [[Robert Mitchum]] as Captain Victor "Pug" Henry, the main character. The novels are historical fiction. Each has three layers: the story told from the viewpoints of Captain Henry and his circle of family and friends, a more or less straightforward historical account of the events of the war, and an analysis by a member of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s military staff, the insightful fictional General Armin von Roon. Wouk devoted "thirteen years of extraordinary research and long, arduous composition" to these two novels, noted [[Arnold Beichman]]. "The seriousness with which Wouk has dealt with the war can be seen in the prodigious amount of research, reading, travel and conferring with experts, the evidence of which may be found in the uncatalogued boxes at Columbia University" that contain the author's papers.<ref name=beichman>{{Cite book|last=Beichman|first=Arnold|title=Herman Wouk: The Novelist as Social Historian|publisher=[[Transaction Publishers|Transaction Books]]|date=1984}}</ref>

Wouk often referred to his journals to check dates and facts in his writing, and he was hesitant to let the originals out of his personal possession. A solution was negotiated: a scanning service bureau was selected to scan the entire set of volumes into digital formats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.twinimaging.com/news.html|title=Twin Imaging Technology preserves personal journals for Pulitzer Prize author, Herman Wouk|date=July 2008|publisher=Twin Imaging Technology|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308143230/http://www.twinimaging.com/news.html|archive-date=March 8, 2010|access-date=February 22, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Personal life and death==
In late 1944 Wouk met Betty Sarah Brown, a [[Phi Beta Kappa]] graduate of the [[University of Southern California]], who was working as a personnel specialist in the navy while the ''Zane'' was undergoing repairs in [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro, California]]. The two quickly fell in love and after his ship went back to sea, Betty, who was born a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and was raised in [[Grangeville, Idaho]], began her study of Judaism and converted on her twenty-fifth birthday. They were married on December 10, 1945.<ref name=beichman />

With the birth of the first of their three children the next year, Wouk became a full-time writer to support his growing family. His first-born son, Abraham Isaac Wouk (1946–1951), was named after Wouk's late father. He drowned in a swimming pool accident in [[Mexico]] shortly before his fifth birthday. Wouk later dedicated ''War and Remembrance'' to him with the Biblical words "בלע המות לנצח – He will destroy death forever" (Isaiah 25:8).
