'''Charles R. Tanner''' (February 17, 1896 – 9 January 1974) was an American science fiction and fantasy author who wrote in the late 1930s and early 1940s.  Tanner's first short story was "The Color of Space", published in ''[[Wonder Stories|Science Wonder Stories]]'' in 1930. Within a few years, he created his character Tumithak, who featured in three stories published during Tanner's lifetime ("Tumithak of the Corridors", "Tumithak in Shawm", and "Tumithak and the Towers of Fire") and a fourth, "Tumithak and the Ancient Word", published posthumously in 2005.

During the [[Great Depression]], one of Tanner's three children died, while his wife suffered an extended hospitalization for [[tuberculosis]].<ref>"Meet the Authors", ''Amazing Stories'', June 1938, pp.&nbsp;6–7</ref>
