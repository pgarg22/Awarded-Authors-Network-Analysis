Born at [[Lichfield]] in [[Staffordshire]], and educated at a school in [[Bloomsbury]], he entered the British Museum in 1851 as an assistant librarian. [[Anthony Panizzi]], a close friend of Garnett's father, invited the then 16-year-old Richard to work at the British Museum following his father's death.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Garnett Family|last=Heilbrum|first=Carolyn G.|publisher=George Allen and Unwin Ltd|year=1961|location=London|pages=36}}</ref> In 1875, he became superintendent of the Reading Room, in 1881, editor of the General Catalogue of Printed Books, and in 1890 until his retirement in 1899, Keeper of Printed Books.

His literary works include numerous translations from the [[Greek language|Greek]], German, Italian, Spanish, and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]; several books of verse; the book of short stories ''[[The Twilight of the Gods and Other Tales|The Twilight of the Gods]]'' (1888, 16 stories; 12 stories added in the 1903 edition);<ref name="Stableford">{{cite book |author-last=Stableford |author-first=Brian |author-link=Brian Stableford |article=Garnett, Richard |title=St. James Guide To Fantasy Writers |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781558622050 |url-access=registration |editor-first=David |editor-last=Pringle |editor-link=David Pringle |publisher=St. James Press |date=1996 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781558622050/page/222 222–3]}}</ref> biographies of [[Thomas Carlyle]], [[John Milton]], [[William Blake]], and others; [http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000906390 ''The Age of Dryden''] (1895); a [http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001357705 ''History of Italian Literature'']; [http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/009923970 ''English Literature: An Illustrated Record''] (with [[Edmund Gosse]]); and many articles for encyclopaedias, including the ninth and tenth editions of the ''[[History of the Encyclopædia Britannica|Encyclopædia Britannica]]'',<ref>[https://www.1902encyclopedia.com/contributors.html Important Contributors to the Britannica, 9th and 10th Editions], 1902encyclopedia.com. Retrieved 11 October 2020</ref> and the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]''.

He also discovered and edited some unpublished poems of [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]] (''Relics of Shelley'', 1862) and edited the republication of the newly discovered poetry collection ''[[Original Poetry by Victor and Cazire]]'' in 1898. His poem "[[Where Corals Lie]]" was set to music by Sir [[Edward Elgar]] as part of ''[[Sea Pictures]]'' and was first performed in 1899. Long interested in astrology, in 1880 he published a monograph on the subject, "The Soul and the Stars", in the ''[[Dublin University Magazine|University Magazine]]'' under the pseudonym "A. G. Trent"; ill health prevented him from writing more on the subject.<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911 |wstitle=Garnett, Richard}}</ref> He wrote a biography of prime minister [[Charles James Fox]], published 1910.

In 1901, Garnett was elected as a member to the [[American Philosophical Society]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=APS Member History|url=https://search.amphilsoc.org/memhist/search?creator=&title=&subject=&subdiv=&mem=&year=1901&year-max=&dead=&keyword=&smode=advanced|access-date=2021-05-19|website=search.amphilsoc.org}}</ref>

He died on 13 April 1906 and was buried on the eastern side of [[Highgate Cemetery]].

According to [[Joseph McCabe]], Garnett "cherished a genuine and somewhat mystical belief in religion, which combined hostility to priestcraft and dogma with a modified belief in [[astrology]]".<ref name="McCabe">{{cite book |first=Joseph |last=McCabe |title=A Biographical Dictionary of Modern Rationalists |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.83761 |publisher=Watts & Co. |location=London |date=1920 |page=[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.83761/page/n172 280]}}</ref>

The writer, critic and editor [[Edward Garnett]] was his son, the translator [[Constance Garnett]] was his daughter-in-law, and the [[Bloomsbury Group]] writer [[David Garnett|David (Bunny) Garnett]] was his grandson.
