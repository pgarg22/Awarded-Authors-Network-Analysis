'''Carl Zuckmayer''' (27 December 1896 – 18 January 1977) was a German writer and playwright. His older brother was the pedagogue, composer, conductor, and pianist [[Eduard Zuckmayer]].

==Life and career==
[[File:Zuckmayer family july1906.jpg|thumb|The Zuckmayer family in July 1906, from left to right: Carl Sr., Amalie, Carl Jr., [[Eduard Zuckmayer|Eduard]]]]

Born in [[Nackenheim]] in [[Rhenish Hesse]], he was the second son of Amalie (1869–1954), née Goldschmidt, and Carl Zuckmayer [[:de:Carl Zuckmayer (Unternehmer)|de]] (1864–1947).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/carlzuckmayersge0000fink|url-access=registration|quote=Carl Zuckmayer Goldschmidt.|title=Carl Zuckmayer's Germany|publisher=Haag + Herchen|author=Margot Finke|isbn=9783892285779|year=1990}}</ref> When he was four years old, his family moved to [[Mainz]]. With the outbreak of [[World War I]], he (like many other high school students) finished [[Rabanus-Maurus-Gymnasium]] with a facilitated "emergency" ''[[Abitur]]'' and volunteered for military service. During the war, he served with the [[Imperial German Army|German Army's]] field artillery on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. In 1917, he published his first poems in the [[pacifist]] journal ''[[Die Aktion]]'' and he was one of the signatures of the "Appeal" published  by the [[Antinational Socialist Party]] after the [[German Revolution]] of 9 November 1918. By this time, Zuckmayer held the rank of a ''Leutnant der Reserve'' (Reserve Officer).

After the war, he took up studies at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt]], first in [[humanities]], later in [[biology]] and [[botany]]. In 1920, he married his childhood friend Annemarie Ganz, but they were divorced just one year later, when Zuckmayer had an affair with actress Annemarie Seidel.

Zuckmayer's initial ventures into literature and theatre were complete failures. His first drama, ''Kreuzweg'' (1921), fell flat and was delisted after only three performances, and when he was chosen as dramatic adviser at the theatre of [[Kiel]], he lost his new job after his first, controversial staging of [[Terence]]'s ''[[Eunuchus|The Eunuch]]''. In 1924, he became [[dramaturg]] at the [[Deutsches Theater (Berlin)|Deutsches Theater]] in Berlin, jointly with [[Bertolt Brecht]]. After another failure with his second drama, ''Pankraz erwacht oder Die Hinterwäldler'', he finally had a public success with the rustic comedy ''Der fröhliche Weinberg'' ("[[The Merry Vineyard (play)|The Merry Vineyard]]") in 1925, written in his local Mainz-Frankfurt dialect. This work won him the prestigious [[Kleist Prize]] two years after it was awarded to Brecht, and launched his career.<ref>Mitchell, Allan, Unrepentant Patriot: The LIfe and Work of Carl Zuckmayer, p.&nbsp;23-24</ref>

Also in 1925, Zuckmayer married the Austrian actress {{ill|Alice Herdan|de|Alice Herdan-Zuckmayer}}, and they bought a house in [[Henndorf]] near [[Salzburg]] in Austria. Zuckmayer's next play, ''Der Schinderhannes'', was again successful. In 1929, he wrote the script for the movie ''[[Der blaue Engel]]'' (starring [[Marlene Dietrich]]), based on the novel ''Professor Unrat'' by [[Heinrich Mann]]. That year, he was also awarded the [[Georg Büchner Prize]], another prestigious German-language literary award.

In 1931, his play ''[[The Captain of Köpenick (play)|Der Hauptmann von Köpenick]]'' premiered and became another success, but his plays were prohibited when the [[Nazism|Nazis]] came to power in Germany in 1933 (Zuckmayer's maternal grandfather had been born Jewish and converted to [[Protestantism]]).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=COP4moe9cKUC&q=Carl+Zuckmayer+protestant+church&pg=PR9|title=Carl Zuckmayer Criticism: Tracing Endangered Fame|author=Hans Wagener|isbn=9781571130648|year=1995}}</ref> Zuckmayer and his family moved to their house in Austria, where he published a few more works. After the ''[[Anschluss]]'', he was expatriated by the [[Nazi]] government, and the Zuckmayers fled via [[Switzerland]] to the United States in 1939, where he first worked as a script writer in Hollywood before renting Backwoods Farm near [[Barnard, Vermont]] in 1941 and working there as a farmer until 1946.  In 1943/44, Zuckmayer wrote "character portraits" of actors, writers, and other artists in Germany for the [[Office of Strategic Services]], evaluating their involvement with the Nazi regime. This became known only in 2002, when the approximately 150 reports were published in Germany under the title ''Geheimreport''. The family's Vermont years are narrated in Alice Herdan-Zuckmayer's ''Die Farm in den grünen Bergen'' ("The Farm in the Green Mountains"), a bestseller in Germany upon its 1949 publication.

In January 1946, after [[World War II]], Zuckmayer was granted the [[US citizenship]] he had applied for already in 1943. He returned to Germany and traveled the country for five months as a US cultural attaché. The resulting report to the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] was first published in Germany in 2004 (''Deutschlandbericht''). His play ''[[Des Teufels General]]'' ("The Devil's General"; the main character is based on the biography of [[Ernst Udet]]), which he had written in Vermont, premiered in [[Zürich]] on 14 December 1946. The play became a major success in post-war Germany; one of the first post-war literary attempts to broach the issue of [[Nazism]]. It was filmed in 1955 and starred [[Curd Jürgens]].

Zuckmayer kept writing: ''Barbara Blomberg'' premiered in [[Konstanz]] in 1949 and ''Das kalte Licht'' in [[Hamburg]] in 1955. He also wrote the screenplay for ''[[Die Jungfrau auf dem Dach]]'', the German-language version of [[Otto Preminger]]'s 1953 film ''[[The Moon Is Blue (film)|The Moon is Blue]]''. Having shuttled back and forth between the U.S. and Europe for several years, the Zuckmayers left the U.S. in 1958 and settled in [[Saas Fee]] in the [[Valais]] in Switzerland. In 1966, he became a Swiss citizen, and published his memoirs, titled ''Als wär's ein Stück von mir''<ref>a quotation from the poem [[Ich hatt' einen Kameraden]]</ref> ("A part of myself"). His last play, ''[[Der Rattenfänger]]'', (music by [[Friedrich Cerha]]) premiered in [[Zürich]] in 1975. Zuckmayer died on 18 January 1977 in [[Visp]]. His body was interred on 22 January in [[Saas Fee]].

Zuckmayer received numerous awards during his life, such as the [[Goethe Prize]] of the city of [[Frankfurt]] in 1952, the ''[[Bundesverdienstkreuz]] mit Stern'' in 1955, the Austrian ''Staatspreis für Literatur'' in 1960, ''[[Pour le Mérite]]'' in 1967, and the Austrian ''Verdienstkreuz am Band'' in 1968.
