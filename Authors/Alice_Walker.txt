==Early life==

Alice Malsenior Walker was born in [[Eatonton, Georgia]], a rural farming town, to Willie Lee Walker and Minnie Tallulah Grant.<ref name=":5">{{cite book |last=Bates |first=Gerri |title=Alice Walker: A Critical Companion |url=https://archive.org/details/alicewalkercriti0000bate |url-access=registration |publisher=Greenwood Press |year=2005 |isbn=9780313069093 |oclc=62321382}}</ref><ref>Moore, Geneva Cobb, and Andrew Billingsley.

Walker, the youngest of eight children, was first enrolled in school when she was just four years old at East Putnam Consolidated.<ref name=":5" /><ref name=":06">{{cite web|url=http://www.emory.edu/alicewalker/sub-about.htm|title=About Alice Walker|last=The Officers of the Alice Walker Literary Society|publisher=Alice Walker Literary Society|access-date=June 15, 2015}}</ref>

As an eight-year-old, Walker sustained an injury to her right eye after one of her brothers fired a [[BB gun]].<ref name=":06"/> Since her family did not have access to a car, Walker could not receive immediate medical attention, causing her to become permanently [[Visual impairment|blind]] in that eye. It was after the injury to her eye that Walker began to take up reading and writing.<ref name=":5" /> The scar tissue was removed when Walker was 14, but a mark still remains. It is described in her essay "Beauty: When the Other Dancer is the Self."<ref name="Apr 20094">''World Authors 1995–2000'', 2003. Biography Reference Bank database. Retrieved April 10, 2009.</ref><ref name=":06"/>

As the schools in [[Eatonton, Georgia|Eatonton]] were segregated, Walker attended the only high school available to blacks: Butler Baker High School.<ref name=":06"/> There, she went on to become [[valedictorian]], and enrolled in [[Spelman College]] in 1961 after being granted a full scholarship by the state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] for having the highest academic achievements of her class.<ref name=":5" /> She found two of her professors, [[Howard Zinn]] and [[Staughton Lynd]], to be great mentors during her time at [[Spelman College|Spelman]], but both were transferred two years later.<ref name=":06"/> Walker was offered another scholarship, this time from [[Sarah Lawrence College]] in New York, and after the firing of her [[Spelman College|Spelman]] professor, Howard Zinn, Walker accepted the offer.<ref name="Apr 20094"/> Walker became pregnant at the start of her senior year and had an abortion; this experience, as well as the bout of [[Suicide|suicidal]] thoughts that followed, inspired much of the poetry found in ''Once'', Walker's first collection of poetry.<ref name="Apr 20094"/> Walker graduated from [[Sarah Lawrence College|Sarah Lawrence]] in 1965.<ref name="Apr 20094"/>

==Writing career==

Walker wrote the poems that would culminate in her first book of poetry, entitled ''Once'', while she was a student in East Africa and during her senior year at [[Sarah Lawrence College]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Once (1968)|url=http://alicewalkersgarden.com/2010/09/book-poetry-once-1968/|website=Alice Walker The Official Website for the American Novelist & Poet|access-date=March 12, 2017}}</ref> Walker would slip her poetry under the office door of her professor and mentor, [[Muriel Rukeyser]], when she was a student at [[Sarah Lawrence College|Sarah Lawrence]]. Rukeyser then showed the poems to her [[Literary agent|agent]]. ''Once'' was published four years later by [[Harcourt (publisher)|Harcourt Brace Jovanovich]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/entertainment/books/2001/09/16/muriel-rukeyser-was-21-when-he/ec05fd62-733c-4827-9260-6c60996ec212/|title=Muriel Rukeyser was 21 when he ...|date=September 16, 2001|work=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=March 26, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref><ref name="Apr 20094"/>

Following graduation, Walker briefly worked for the New York City [[Department of Welfare of Differently Abled Persons (Tamil Nadu)|Department of Welfare]], before returning to the South. She took a job working for the Legal Defense Fund of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] in [[Jackson, Mississippi]].<ref name=":06"/> Walker also worked as a consultant in black history to the Friends of the Children of Mississippi Head Start program. She later returned to writing as [[Artist-in-residence|writer-in-residence]] at [[Jackson State University]] (1968–69) and [[Tougaloo College]] (1970–71). In addition to her work at [[Tougaloo College]], Walker published her first novel, ''[[The Third Life of Grange Copeland]],'' in 1970. The novel explores the life of Grange Copeland, an abusive, irresponsible sharecropper, husband and father.

In the fall of 1972, Walker taught a course in Black Women's Writers at the [[University of Massachusetts Boston]].<ref>[https://www.smith.edu/libraries/libs/ssc/vof/transcripts/Smith.pdf] Interview with Barbara Smith, May 7–8, 2003. p. 50. Retrieved July 19, 2017</ref>

In 1973, before becoming editor of ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'' [[Ms. (magazine)|''Magazine'']], Walker and literary scholar Charlotte D. Hunt discovered an unmarked grave they believed to be that of [[Zora Neale Hurston]] in [[Ft. Pierce, Florida]].

Walker's 1975 article "In Search of Zora Neale Hurston," published in [[Ms. (magazine)|''Ms.'' Magazine]], helped revive interest in the work of this African-American writer and anthropologist.<ref name="monica-miller">{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Monica|title=Archaeology of a Classic|url=http://barnard.edu/news/archaeology-classic-celebrating-zora-neale-hurston-28|website=News & Events|publisher=Barnard College|access-date=June 14, 2014|date=December 17, 2012}}</ref>

In 1976, Walker's second novel, ''[[Meridian (novel)|Meridian]],'' was published. ''Meridian'' is a novel about activist workers in the South, during the [[civil rights movement]], with events that closely parallel some of Walker's own experiences. In 1982, she published what has become her best-known work, ''[[The Color Purple]]''. The novel follows a young, troubled black woman fighting her way through not just [[Racism|racist]] white culture but [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] black culture as well. The book became a bestseller and was subsequently adapted into a critically acclaimed 1985 movie directed by [[Steven Spielberg]], featuring [[Oprah Winfrey]] and [[Whoopi Goldberg]], as well as a 2005 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[The Color Purple (musical)|musical]] totaling 910 performances.

Walker has written several other novels, including ''[[The Temple of My Familiar]]'' and ''[[Possessing the Secret of Joy]]'' (which featured several characters and descendants of characters from ''The Color Purple''). She has published a number of collections of short stories, poetry, and other writings. Her work is focused on the struggles of black people, particularly women, and their lives in a [[racism|racist]], [[sexism|sexist]], and violent society.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.celebritytalent.net/sampletalent/187/alice-walker/|title=Alice Walker Booking Agent for Corporate Functions, Events, Keynote Speaking, or Celebrity Appearances|work=celebritytalent.net|access-date=October 23, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blackhistory.com/content/61723/alice-walker|title=Alice Walker|work=blackhistory.com|access-date=October 23, 2015|archive-date=September 10, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910011201/http://blackhistory.com/content/61723/alice-walker|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biblio.com/alice-walker~125189~author|title=Alice Walker|work=biblio.com|access-date=October 23, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.litlovers.com/reading-guides/13-fiction/211-color-purple-walker?start=1|title=The Color Purple – Alice Walker – Author Biography – LitLovers|author=Molly Lundquist|work=litlovers.com|access-date=October 23, 2015}}</ref><ref>[http://marylandpublicschools.org/NR/rdonlyres/F68E8866-61CB-4AF5-8AE6-F9275A9CEE9C/35632/Everday_Use_04042013_.pdf "Analyzing Characterization and Point of View in Alice Walker's Short Fiction".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514143531/http://marylandpublicschools.org/NR/rdonlyres/F68E8866-61CB-4AF5-8AE6-F9275A9CEE9C/35632/Everday_Use_04042013_.pdf |date=May 14, 2013 }}</ref>

In 2000, Walker released a collection of short fiction, based on her own life, called ''The Way Forward Is With a Broken Heart,'' exploring love and race relations.

The collection also contains a scrapbook of poetry compiled when Walker was 15, entitled "Poems of a Childhood Poetess."

In 2013, Alice Walker published two new books, one of them entitled ''The Cushion in the Road: Meditation and Wandering as the Whole World Awakens to Being in Harm's Way''. The other was a book of poems entitled ''The World Will Follow Joy Turning Madness into Flowers (New Poems)''.

=== Civil rights ===

Walker met [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] when she was a student at [[Spelman College]] in the early 1960s. She credits King for her decision to return to the [[American South]] as an activist in the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. She took part in the [[1963 March on Washington]]. Later, she volunteered to register black voters in Georgia and Mississippi.<ref>[http://www.democracynow.org/2006/11/17/inner_light_in_a_time_of Walker Interview transcript and audio file on "Inner Light in A time of darkness"], ''Democracy Now!''

=== Womanism  ===

Walker's specific brand of [[feminism]] included advocacy of women of color. In 1983, Walker coined the term ''[[Womanism|womanist]]'' in her collection ''[[In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens]]'', to mean "a black feminist or feminist of color." The term was made to unite women of color and the feminist movement at "the intersection of race, class, and gender oppression."<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Deeper shades of purple : womanism in religion and society|date=2006|publisher=New York University Press|others=Floyd-Thomas, Stacey M., 1969–|isbn=978-0814727522|location=New York|oclc=64688636}}</ref> Walker states that, "'Womanism' gives us a word of our own."<ref>Wilma Mankiller and others, "Womanism".

=== Israeli–Palestinian conflict ===

In January 2009, Walker was one of over fifty signatories of a letter protesting against the [[Toronto International Film Festival]]'s "City to City" spotlight on Israeli filmmakers, and condemning Israel as an "[[apartheid]] regime."<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/sep/05/filmmakers-react-anti-israel-film-festival-protest/ |title=Toronto film festival ignites anti-Israel boycott |newspaper=The Washington Times |author=Brown, Barry |date=September 5, 2009 |access-date=August 1, 2012}}</ref>

Two months later, Walker and sixty other female activists from the anti-war group [[Code Pink]] traveled to [[Gaza City|Gaza]] in response to the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]]. Their purpose was to deliver aid, to meet with NGOs and residents, and to persuade Israel and Egypt to open their borders with Gaza. She planned to visit Gaza again in December 2009 to participate in the [[Gaza Freedom March]].<ref>[http://www.gazafreedommarch.org/article.php?id=5063 Gaza Freedom March] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903212614/http://www.gazafreedommarch.org/article.php?id=5063 |date=September 3, 2009 }}.

In May 2013, Walker posted an open letter to singer [[Alicia Keys]], asking her to cancel a planned concert in [[Tel Aviv]]. "I believe we are mutually respectful of each other's path and work," Walker wrote. "It would grieve me to know you are putting yourself in danger (soul danger) by performing in an apartheid country that is being boycotted by many global conscious artists."

===Pacifism===

Walker has been a longtime sponsor of the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]]. In early 2015, she wrote: "So I think of any movement for peace and justice as something that is about stabilizing our inner spirit so that we can go on and bring into the world a vision that is much more humane than the one we have dominant today."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wilpfus.org/emailArchives/PresidentsCorner/2015_01_15.html|title=From the President's Corner|author=Harrison, Mary Hanson|publisher=WILPF|date=January 20, 2015|access-date=January 26, 2019 }}</ref>

In 2017, Walker published what ''[[Tablet (magazine)|Tablet]]'' magazine described as "an explicitly anti-Semitic poem" on her blog entitled "It Is Our (Frightful) Duty To Study [[The Talmud]]", recommending that the reader should start with YouTube to learn about the shocking aspects of the Talmud.<ref name="tablet 2018">{{cite news|last=Rosenberg |first=Yair|url=https://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/277273/the-new-york-times-just-published-an-unqualified-recommendation-for-an-insanely-anti-semitic-book |title='The New York Times' Just Published an Unqualified Recommendation for an Insanely Anti-Semitic Book|work=[[Tablet (magazine)|Tablet]]|access-date=December 17, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Walker |first=Alice |title=It Is Our (Frightful) Duty |url=http://alicewalkersgarden.com/2017/11/it-is-our-frightful-duty-to-study-the-talmud/ |website=Alice Walker: The Official Website |access-date=December 17, 2018}}</ref> The poem includes the lines: "Are Goyim (us) meant to be slaves of Jews?" and "Are three year old (and a day) girls eligible for marriage and intercourse?

In 2018, Walker was asked by an interviewer from ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' "What books are on your nightstand?" She listed Icke's ''And the Truth Shall Set You Free,'' a book promoting an [[antisemitic]] conspiracy theory which draws on ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' and queries the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]].

==Personal life==
In 1965, Walker met [[Melvyn R. Leventhal|Melvyn Rosenman Leventhal]], a Jewish civil rights lawyer. They were married on March 17, 1967, in New York City. Later that year the couple relocated to [[Jackson, Mississippi]], becoming the first legally-married [[interracial]] couple in Mississippi since [[miscegenation]] laws were introduced in the state.<ref name="entertainment.timesonline.co.uk">{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article3866798.ece |title=The day feminist icon Alice Walker resigned as my mother |newspaper=The Times |location=London |date=May 4, 2008 |author=Driscoll, Margarette |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511201732/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article3866798.ece |archive-date=May 11, 2008 }}</ref><ref name="democracy">{{cite news|title=Inner Light in a Time of Darkness: A Conversation with Author and Poet Alice Walker |work=[[Democracy Now!]] |date=November 17, 2006 |url=http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=06/11/17/1454228 |access-date=June 14, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613182120/http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=06%2F11%2F17%2F1454228 |archive-date=June 13, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> They were harassed and threatened by whites, including the [[Ku Klux Klan]].<ref name="Parsons">{{cite book|last1=Parsons|first1=Elaine|title=Ku-Klux : The Birth of the Klan During Reconstruction|date=2015|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=February 2017}} The couple had a daughter, [[Rebecca Walker|Rebecca]], in 1969.
