'''William Wordsworth''' (7 April 1770{{snd}}23 April 1850) was an English [[Romantic poetry|Romantic]] poet who, with [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], helped to launch the [[Romanticism|Romantic Age]] in [[English literature]] with their joint publication ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'' (1798).

Wordsworth's ''[[masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' is generally considered to be ''[[The Prelude]]'', a semi-autobiographical poem of his early years that he revised and expanded a number of times. It was posthumously titled and published by his wife in the year of his death, before which it was generally known as "the poem to Coleridge".

Wordsworth was [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]] from 1843 until his death from [[pleurisy]] on 23 April 1850.

==Early life==
{{Main|Early life of William Wordsworth}}

The second of five children born to John Wordsworth and Ann Cookson, William Wordsworth was born on 7 April 1770 in what is now named [[Wordsworth House]] in [[Cockermouth]], Cumberland, (now in Cumbria),<ref>{{NHLE |num=1327088 |desc=Wordsworth House |access-date=21 December 2009}}</ref> part of the scenic region in northwestern England known as the [[Lake District]]. William's sister, the poet and diarist [[Dorothy Wordsworth]], to whom he was close all his life, was born the following year, and the two were baptised together. They had three other siblings: Richard, the eldest, who became a lawyer; John, born after Dorothy, who went to sea and died in 1805 when the ship of which he was captain, the ''[[Earl of Abergavenny (1796 EIC ship)|Earl of Abergavenny]]'', was wrecked off the south coast of England; and [[Christopher Wordsworth (divine)|Christopher]], the youngest, who entered the Church and rose to be Master of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].<ref>{{cite book|section=Appendix A (Past Governors)|last1=Allport|first1=Denison Howard|first2=Norman J.|last2=Friskney|title=A Short History of Wilson's School|publisher=Wilson's School Charitable Trust|year=1986|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iyQxGwAACAAJ}}</ref>

Wordsworth's father was a legal representative of [[James Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale]], and, through his connections, lived in a large mansion in the small town. He was frequently away from home on business, so the young William and his siblings had little involvement with him and remained distant from him until his death in 1783.<ref>Moorman 1968 pp. 5–7.</ref> However, he did encourage William in his reading, and in particular set him to commit large portions of verse to memory, including works by [[John Milton|Milton]], [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]]. William was also allowed to use his father's library.
William also spent time at his mother's parents' house in [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]], Cumberland, where he was exposed to the moors, but did not get along with his grandparents or his uncle, who also lived there. His hostile interactions with them distressed him to the point of contemplating suicide.<ref>Moorman 1968:9–13.</ref>

Wordsworth was taught to read by his mother and attended, first, a tiny school of low quality in Cockermouth, then a school in Penrith for the children of upper-class families, where he was taught by Ann Birkett, who insisted on instilling in her students traditions that included pursuing both scholarly and local activities, especially the festivals around Easter, May Day and [[Shrove Tuesday]]. Wordsworth was taught both the Bible and the ''[[The Spectator (1711)|Spectator]]'', but little else. It was at the school in Penrith that he met the Hutchinsons, including Mary, who later became his wife.<ref>Moorman 1968:15–18.</ref>

After the death of Wordsworth's mother, in 1778, his father sent him to [[Hawkshead Grammar School]] in [[Lancashire]] (now in [[Cumbria]]) and sent Dorothy to live with relatives in [[Yorkshire]]. She and William did not meet again for nine years.

Wordsworth made his debut as a writer in 1787 when he published a sonnet in ''[[The European Magazine]]''. That same year he began attending [[St John's College, Cambridge]]. He received his BA degree in 1791.<ref>{{acad|id=WRDT787W|name=Wordsworth, William}}</ref> He returned to Hawkshead for the first two summers of his time at Cambridge, and often spent later holidays on [[Hiking#Walking tours today|walking tours]], visiting places famous for the beauty of their [[landscape]]. In 1790 he went on a walking tour of Europe, during which he toured the [[Alps]] extensively, and visited nearby areas of France, Switzerland, and Italy.<ref name="Bennett2015">{{cite book|author=Andrew Bennett|title=William Wordsworth in Context|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XPtDBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA191|date=12 February 2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-02841-8|page=191}}</ref>

===Relationship with Annette Vallon===
In November 1791, Wordsworth visited [[Revolutionary France]] and became enchanted with the Republican movement. He fell in love with a French woman, Annette Vallon, who, in 1792, gave birth to their daughter Caroline. Financial problems and [[Great Britain|Britain]]'s tense relations with France forced him to return to England alone the following year.<ref name=webbio>Everett, Glenn, [http://www.victorianweb.org/previctorian/ww/bio.html "William Wordsworth: Biography"] at The Victorian Web, accessed 7 January 2007.</ref> The circumstances of his return and his subsequent behaviour raised doubts as to his declared wish to marry Annette. However, he supported her and his daughter as best he could in later life. The [[Reign of Terror]] left Wordsworth thoroughly disillusioned with the French Revolution and the outbreak of armed hostilities between Britain and France prevented him from seeing Annette and his daughter for some years.

With the [[Peace of Amiens]] again allowing travel to France, in 1802 Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy visited Annette and Caroline in [[Calais]]. The purpose of the visit was to prepare Annette for the fact of his forthcoming marriage to Mary Hutchinson.<ref name=webbio/> Afterwards he wrote the sonnet "[[It is a beauteous evening, calm and free]]", recalling a seaside walk with the 9-year-old Caroline, whom he had never seen before that visit. Mary was anxious that Wordsworth should do more for Caroline. Upon Caroline's marriage, in 1816, Wordsworth settled £30 a year on her (equivalent to £2,313 as of 2021), payments which continued until 1835, when they were replaced by a capital settlement.<ref>Gill (1989) pp. 208, 299</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Purchasing Power of British Pounds from 1245 to Present|url=http://www.measuringworth.com/calculators/ppoweruk/|publisher=MeasuringWorth.com|access-date=28 May 2012}}</ref>

== Early career ==
===First publication and ''Lyrical Ballads''===
[[File:William Wordsworth at 28 by William Shuter2.jpg|thumb|right|Wordsworth in 1798, about the time he began ''[[The Prelude]]''.<ref>"[http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/collections/wordsworth.html The Cornell Wordsworth Collection]". [[Cornell University]]. Retrieved 13 February 2009.</ref>]] The year 1793 saw the first publication of poems by Wordsworth, in the collections ''An Evening Walk'' and ''Descriptive Sketches''. In 1795 he received a legacy of £900 from Raisley Calvert and became able to pursue a career as a poet.

It was also in 1795 that he met [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] in Somerset. The two poets quickly developed a close friendship. For two years from 1795, William and his sister Dorothy lived at Racedown House in Dorset—a property of the Pinney family—to the west of [[Pilsdon Pen]]. They walked in the area for about two hours every day, and the nearby hills consoled Dorothy as she pined for the fells of her native Lakeland. She wrote,
<blockquote>"We have hills which, seen from a distance almost take the character of mountains, some cultivated nearly to their summits, others in their wild state covered with furze and broom. These delight me the most as they remind me of our native wilds."<ref>{{cite book|title=Dorset Villages|author=Roland Gant|publisher=Robert Hale Ltd|pages=111–112|year=1980|isbn=0-7091-8135-3}}</ref></blockquote>

In 1797, the pair moved to [[Alfoxton House]], Somerset, just a few miles away from Coleridge's home in [[Nether Stowey]]. Together Wordsworth and Coleridge (with insights from Dorothy) produced ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'' (1798), an important work in the English [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]].<ref>{{Cite book |year=1798 |title=Lyricall Ballads: With a Few Other Poems    |edition=1 |publisher=  J. & A. Arch |publication-date=1798 |location=London |url= https://archive.org/details/lyricalballadswi00word |access-date=13 November 2014 }} via archive.org</ref> The volume gave neither Wordsworth's nor Coleridge's name as author. One of Wordsworth's most famous poems, "[[Tintern Abbey (poem)|Tintern Abbey]]", was published in this collection, along with Coleridge's "[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]". The second edition, published in 1800, had only Wordsworth listed as the author, and included a preface to the poems.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wordsworth |first= William  |year=1800 |title=Lyrical Ballads with Other Poems |edition=2 |publisher=  Printed for T.N.

Rees |publication-date=1802 |location=London |volume= I |url=https://archive.org/details/lyricalballadsw01colegoog |access-date=13 November 2014 }} via archive.org.</ref> In this preface, which some scholars consider a central work of Romantic literary theory, Wordsworth discusses what he sees as the elements of a new type of verse, one that is based on the ordinary language "really used by men" while avoiding the poetic diction of much 18th-century verse. Wordsworth also gives his famous definition of poetry as "the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquility", and calls his own poems in the book "experimental". A fourth and final edition of ''Lyrical Ballads'' was published in 1805.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wordsworth |first= William |year=1805 |title=Lyrical Ballads with Pastoral and other Poems |edition=4 |publisher=Printed for Longman, Hurst, Rees, and Orme, by R.

====''The Borderers''====
Between 1795–1797, Wordsworth wrote his only play, ''The Borderers'', a verse tragedy set during the reign of [[Henry III of England|King Henry III of England]], when Englishmen in the North Country came into conflict with Scottish [[border reivers]]. He attempted to get the play staged in November 1797, but it was rejected by [[Thomas Harris (theatre manager)|Thomas Harris]], the manager of the [[Covent Garden Theatre]], who proclaimed it "impossible that the play should succeed in the representation". The rebuff was not received lightly by Wordsworth and the play was not published until 1842, after substantial revision.<ref>Stephen Gill, ''William Wordsworth: A Life'', [[Oxford University Press]], 1989, pp. 132–133.</ref>

'''''[[I travelled among unknown men]]'''''

I travelled among unknown men,
   In lands beyond the sea;
Nor, England! did I know till then
   What love I bore to thee.

'T is past, that melancholy dream!
   Nor will I quit thy shore
A second time, for still I seem
   To love thee more and more.

Among thy mountains did I feel
   The joy of my desire;
And she I cherished turned her wheel
   Beside an English fire.

Thy mornings showed, thy nights concealed,
   The bowers where Lucy played;
And thine too is the last green field
   That Lucy's eyes surveyed.</poem>|source =<ref>[https://books.google.ru/books?id=kXd4bRr71a4C&pg=PA442&dq=A+Library+of+Poetry+and+Song:+Being+Choice+Selections+from+the+Best+Poets+William+Wordsworth+england&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwja--Pnno_wAhVliIsKHbcZDGkQ6AEwAHoECAIQAg#v=onepage&q=A%20Library%20of%20Poetry%20and%20Song%3A%20Being%20Choice%20Selections%20from%20the%20Best%20Poets%20William%20Wordsworth%20england&f=false ''A Library of Poetry and Song: Being Choice Selections from The Best Poets.

Wordsworth, Dorothy, and Coleridge travelled to Germany in the autumn of 1798. While Coleridge was intellectually stimulated by the journey, its main effect on Wordsworth was to produce homesickness.<ref name=webbio/> During the harsh winter of 1798–99 Wordsworth lived with Dorothy in [[Goslar]], and, despite extreme stress and loneliness, began work on the autobiographical piece that was later titled ''The Prelude''. He wrote a number of other famous poems in Goslar, including "[[The Lucy poems]]". In the Autumn of 1799, Wordsworth and his sister returned to England and visited the Hutchinson family at Sockburn. When Coleridge arrived back in England he travelled to the North with their publisher Joseph Cottle to meet Wordsworth and undertake a proposed tour of the Lake District. This was the immediate cause of the brother and sister's settling at [[Dove Cottage]] in [[Grasmere (village)|Grasmere]] in the Lake District, this time with another poet, [[Robert Southey]], nearby. Wordsworth, Coleridge and Southey came to be known as the "[[Lake Poets]]".<ref>''[[Recollections of the Lake Poets]]''.</ref> Throughout this period many of Wordsworth's poems revolved around themes of death, endurance, separation and grief.

In 1802, Lowther's heir, [[William Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale]], paid the £4,000 owed to Wordsworth's father through Lowther's failure to pay his aide.<ref>Moorman 1968 p. 8</ref> It was this repayment that afforded Wordsworth the financial means to marry. On 4 October, following his visit with Dorothy to France to arrange matters with Annette, Wordsworth married his childhood friend Mary Hutchinson.<ref name="webbio"/> Dorothy continued to live with the couple and grew close to Mary. The following year Mary gave birth to the first of five children, three of whom predeceased her and William:

== Later career ==
===Autobiographical work and ''Poems, in Two Volumes''===
{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2017}}
Wordsworth had for years been making plans to write a long philosophical poem in three parts, which he intended to call ''The Recluse''. In 1798–99 he started an autobiographical poem, which he referred to as the "[[The Prelude|poem to Coleridge]]" and which he planned would serve as an appendix to a larger work called ''The Recluse''. In 1804 he began expanding this autobiographical work, having decided to make it a prologue rather than an appendix. He completed this work, now generally referred to as the first version of ''[[The Prelude]]'', in 1805, but refused to publish such a personal work until he had completed the whole of ''The Recluse''. The death of his brother John, also in 1805, affected him strongly and may have influenced his decisions about these works.
[[File:Rydal Mount - geograph.org.uk - 959824.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rydal Mount]] – home to Wordsworth 1813–1850. Hundreds of visitors came here to see him over the years]]
Wordsworth's philosophical allegiances as articulated in ''[[The Prelude]]'' and in such shorter works as "[[Lines written a few miles above Tintern Abbey]]" have been a source of critical debate. It was long supposed that Wordsworth relied chiefly on Coleridge for philosophical guidance, but more recently scholars have suggested that Wordsworth's ideas may have been formed years before he and Coleridge became friends in the mid-1790s. In particular, while he was in revolutionary Paris in 1792, the 22-year-old Wordsworth made the acquaintance of the mysterious traveller [[John "Walking" Stewart]] (1747–1822),<ref>[[Kelly Grovier]], "Dream Walker: A Wordsworth Mystery Solved", ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'', 16 February 2007</ref> who was nearing the end of his thirty years of wandering, on foot, from [[Madras]], India, through [[Persia]] and [[Arabia]], across Africa and Europe, and up through the fledgling United States. By the time of their association, Stewart had published an ambitious work of original materialist philosophy entitled ''The Apocalypse of Nature'' (London, 1791), to which many of Wordsworth's philosophical sentiments may well be indebted.

In 1807 Wordsworth published ''[[Poems, in Two Volumes]]'', including "[[Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood]]". Up to this point, Wordsworth was known only for ''Lyrical Ballads'', and he hoped that this new collection would cement his reputation. Its reception was lukewarm, however.

In 1810, Wordsworth and Coleridge were estranged over the latter's opium addiction,<ref name=webbio/> and in 1812, his son Thomas died at the age of 6, six months after the death of 3-year-old Catherine. The following year he received an appointment as Distributor of Stamps for Westmorland, and the stipend of £400 a year made him financially secure, albeit at the cost of political independence. In 1813, he and his family, including Dorothy, moved to [[Rydal Mount]], [[Ambleside]] (between Grasmere and Rydal Water), where he spent the rest of his life.<ref name=webbio/>

===The Prospectus===
In 1814 Wordsworth published ''[[The Excursion]]'' as the second part of the three-part work ''The Recluse'', even though he had not completed the first part or the third part, and never did. He did, however, write a poetic Prospectus to ''The Recluse'' in which he laid out the structure and intention of the whole work. The Prospectus contains some of Wordsworth's most famous lines on the relation between the human mind and nature:

{{quote|<poem>
                      ... my voice proclaims
How exquisitely the individual Mind
(And the progressive powers perhaps no less
Of the whole species) to the external World
Is fitted:{{mdash}}and how exquisitely, too{{mdash}}
Theme this but little heard of among Men,
The external World is fitted to the Mind;
And the creation (by no lower name
Can it be called) which they with blended might
Accomplish ...<ref>{{cite book|title=Poetical Works|location=London|publisher=Oxford U.P.|date=1936|series=Oxford Standard Authors|page=590}}</ref></poem>}}

Some modern critics<ref>{{Cite book|title = Wordsworth's Poetry, 1787–1814|last = Hartman|first = Geoffrey|publisher = Yale University Press|year = 1987|isbn = 9780674958210|location = New Haven|pages = 329–331}}</ref> suggest that there was a decline in his work beginning around the mid-1810s, perhaps because most of the concerns that characterised his early poems (loss, death, endurance, separation and abandonment) had been resolved in his writings and his life.<ref>Already in 1891 [[James Kenneth Stephen]] wrote satirically of Wordsworth having "two voices":  one is "of the deep", the other "of an old half-witted sheep/Which bleats articulate monotony".</ref> By 1820, he was enjoying considerable success accompanying a reversal in the contemporary critical opinion of his earlier works.

The poet William Blake, who knew of Wordsworth's work, was struck by Wordsworth's boldness in centering his poetry on the human mind. In response to Wordsworth's poetic program that, “when we look / Into our Minds, into the Mind of Man- / My haunt, and the main region of my song” (The Excursion), William Blake wrote to his friend Henry Crabb Robinson that the passage "“caused him a bowel complaint which nearly killed him”.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Abrams |first1=M.H. |title=Natural Supernaturalism: Tradition and Revolution in Romantic Literature |date=1971 |publisher=Norton |page=24}}</ref>

Following the death of his friend the painter [[William Green (painter)|William Green]] in 1823, Wordsworth also mended his relations with Coleridge.<ref>Sylvanus Urban, ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'', 1823</ref> The two were fully reconciled by 1828, when they toured the [[Rhineland]] together.<ref name=webbio/> Dorothy suffered from a severe illness in 1829 that rendered her an invalid for the remainder of her life. Coleridge and [[Charles Lamb]] both died in 1834, their loss being a difficult blow to Wordsworth. The following year saw the passing of [[James Hogg]]. Despite the death of many contemporaries, the popularity of his poetry ensured a steady stream of young friends and admirers to replace those he lost.

==Religious beliefs==
Wordsworth's youthful political radicalism, unlike Coleridge's, never led him to rebel against his religious upbringing. He remarked in 1812 that he was willing to shed his blood for the established [[Church of England]], reflected in his ''Ecclesiastical Sketches'' of 1822. This religious conservatism also colours ''[[The Excursion]]'' (1814), a long poem that became extremely popular during the nineteenth century. It features three central characters: the Wanderer; the Solitary, who has experienced the hopes and miseries of the [[French Revolution]]; and the Pastor, who dominates the last third of the poem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/previctorian/ww/religion1.html|title=Wordsworth's Religion|website=www.victorianweb.org}}</ref>

==Laureateship and other honours==
Wordsworth remained a formidable presence in his later years. In 1837, the Scottish poet and playwright [[Joanna Baillie]] reflected on her long acquaintance with Wordsworth. "He looks like a man that one must not speak to unless one has some sensible thing to say. However he does occasionally converse cheerfully & well; and when one knows how benevolent & excellent he is, it disposes one to be very much pleased with him."<ref name="Baillie2010">{{cite book|last=Baillie|first=Joanna|editor=Thomas McLean|title=Further Letters of Joanna Baillie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=17xLwZQppO4C&pg=PA22|year=2010|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|location=Madison, NJ|isbn=978-0-8386-4149-1|page=181}}</ref>

In 1838, Wordsworth received an honorary doctorate in Civil Law from the [[University of Durham]] and the following year he was awarded the same honorary degree by the University of Oxford, when [[John Keble]] praised him as the "poet of humanity", praise greatly appreciated by Wordsworth.<ref name=webbio/><ref>Gill, pp396-7</ref> (It has been argued that Wordsworth was a great influence on Keble's immensely popular book of devotional poetry, ''The Christian Year'' (1827).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/religion/herb4.html#ww1|title=The Religious Influence of the Romantic Poets}}</ref>) In 1842, the government awarded him a Civil List pension of £300 a year.

Following the death of Robert Southey in 1843 Wordsworth became [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]]. He initially refused the honour, saying that he was too old, but accepted when the Prime Minister, [[Robert Peel]], assured him that "you shall have nothing required of you". Wordsworth thus became the only poet laureate to write no official verses. The sudden death of his daughter Dora in 1847 at age 42 was difficult for the aging poet to take and in his depression, he completely gave up writing new material.

** "[[Strange fits of passion have I known]]"<ref name=Lucy>M. H. Abrams, editor of ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature: The Romantic Period'', writes of these five poems: "This and the four following pieces are often grouped by editors as the 'Lucy poems,' even though 'A slumber did my spirit seal' does not identify the 'she' who is the subject of that poem. All but the last were written in 1799, while Wordsworth and his sister were in Germany, and homesick. There has been diligent speculation about the identity of Lucy, but it remains speculation. The one certainty is that she is not the girl of Wordsworth's 'Lucy Gray'" (Abrams 2000).</ref>
