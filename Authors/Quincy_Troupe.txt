'''Quincy Thomas Troupe, Jr.''' (born July 22, 1939)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/489 |title=Quincy Troupe |website=Poets.org|access-date= August 27, 2010}}</ref> is an American [[poet]], [[editing|editor]], [[journalist]] and [[professor emeritus]] at the [[University of California, San Diego]], in [[La Jolla]], [[California]]. He is best known as the biographer of [[Miles Davis]], the jazz musician.

==Early life==
Troupe is the son of [[baseball catcher]] [[Quincy Trouppe]] (who added a second "P" to the family name while playing in Mexico to accommodate the Spanish pronunciation "Trou-pay"). As a teenager in 1955, he recalled hearing [[Miles Davis]] at a [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], fish joint, where some fellow patrons identified the 78 rpm juke-box record as "Donna", which was Davis' first recorded composition. (The record is most likely to have been the [[Charlie Parker]] Quintet session recorded for [[Savoy Records]] on May 8, 1947.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jazzdisco.org/savoy-records/catalog-78-rpm-500-600-series/single-index/#652 |title=Savoy Records Catalog: 78 rpm 500/600 series – single index |website=Jazzdisco.org |access-date=December 1, 2015}}</ref>

In his book ''Miles and Me'' Troupe recalls the experience:
{{quote|When I left that joint that afternoon, I felt as though I had undergone a secret initiation, a rite of passage, one that would separate me forever from the rest of the students at Beaumont High School, to which I had just transferred. The school was overwhelmingly white and the students there were "square" to the bone. To my way of thinking , hardly anyone there had any sense of style.}}

As a young man Troupe was athletic and attended [[Grambling State University]] on a basketball [[scholarship]]. However, after his first year he quit and subsequently joined the [[United States Army]], where he was stationed in France and playing on the Army basketball team. While in France he had a chance encounter with the noted French Existentialist philosopher, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], who recommended that Troupe try his hand at poetry.

When he returned to civilian life, Troupe moved to [[Los Angeles]], where he became a regular presence at the [[Watts Writers Workshop]] and began working in a more [[jazz]]-based style. It was on a tour with the Watts group that he first began his academic life as a teacher. The Watts Writers Workshop was located in a building that also had a theater, allowing members to do readings, workshops, plays and presentations. It was a meeting point for many in the [[Black Power movement]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/history/american/civilrights/section6.rhtml |title=The Civil Rights Era (1865–1970): Black Power: 1952–1968 |publisher=SparkNotes |access-date=December 1, 2015}}</ref> [[Black Arts Movement]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/text/brief-guide-black-arts-movement |title=A Brief Guide to the Black Arts Movement &#124; Academy of American Poets |website=Poets.org |date=2014-02-19 |access-date=December 1, 2015}}</ref> and the [[civil rights movement]] and through it Troupe met many individuals involved in other cities including [[Ishmael Reed]] ([[Umbra (poets)|Umbra Group]]), [[James Baldwin]]. In 1968, Troupe edited the anthology ''Watts Poets: A Book of New Poetry and Essays''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/quincy-troupe |title=Quincy Troupe |publisher=The Poetry Foundation |access-date=December 1, 2015}}</ref>

His work is associated with Black Arts Movement writers such as [[Amiri Baraka]], [[Nikki Giovanni]], [[Wanda Coleman]], [[Haki Madhubuti]] and Ishmael Reed,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/text/brief-guide-black-arts-movement |title=A Brief Guide to the Black Arts Movement &#124; Academy of American Poets |website=Poets.org |date=February 19, 2014 |access-date=December 1, 2015}}</ref> who were also friends. Their work was diverse but was strongly informed by world literature and jazz music. Some time later it emerged that the Workshop had been a target of the covert FBI counterintelligence program [[COINTELPRO]], and that the Workshop, along with its theater, were burned to the ground in 1973 by the FBI informant and infiltrator, Darthard Perry (a.k.a. Ed Riggs).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X00BP5hWTZoC&q=Darthard+Perry+%28a.k.a.+Ed+Riggs%29&pg=PA83 |title=The Dark Tree: Jazz and the Community Arts in Los Angeles |author=Steve Isoardi |page=83 |date= April 10, 2006|isbn=9780520932241 |access-date=December 1, 2015}}</ref> It also emerged that Riggs had not only been sabotaging equipment at the Workshop but also used his association with it to infiltrate the Los Angeles chapter of the Black Panthers, and numerous other organizations that promoted black culture, ultimately being instrumental in their demise.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uOYDAAAAMBAJ&q=Darthard+Perry&pg=PA19 |title=Mother Jones Magazine |page=19 |date= April 1977|access-date=December 1, 2015|last1=Jones |first1=Mother }}</ref>

==Career==
Throughout the 1970s Troupe lived in New York, teaching at the College of Staten Island. During that time he was a regular on the poetry circuit, performing alone or in groups around the country.

In 1985 ''Spin'' magazine hired Troupe to write an exclusive two-part interview with Miles Davis, which led [[Simon & Schuster]] to him as co-author for Davis's autobiography. ''[[Miles: The Autobiography]]''<ref>{{cite book|title=Miles: The Autobiography: Miles Davis, Quincy Troupe: 9780671725822: Amazon.com: Books |date= 15 September 1990|isbn=0671725823 |last1=Davis |first1=Miles |last2=Troupe |first2=Quincy }}</ref> was published in 1990 and won an American Book Award<ref>[http://www.beforecolumbusfoundation.com/archive/1980-2001/index.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131127202946/http://www.beforecolumbusfoundation.com/archive/1980-2001/index.html |date=November 27, 2013 }}</ref> for the authors, garnering them numerous positive reviews and accolades.

From 1991 to 2003 Troupe was [[professor]] of [[Caribbean literature|Caribbean]] and [[American literature]]s and [[creative writing]] at the [[University of California, San Diego]], in [[La Jolla]], [[California]].

On June 11, 2002, Troupe was appointed California's first [[poet laureate]] by then Governor [[Gray Davis]]. A [[background check]] related to the new political appointment revealed that Troupe had, in fact, never possessed a degree from Grambling; he attended for only two semesters in 1957–58 and then dropped out.<ref name=nytimes>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/20/us/poet-laureate-quits-after-a-resume-lie.html  | title=Poet Laureate Quits After a Résumé Lie | date= October 20, 2002 | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | access-date= July 7, 2014}}</ref> After admitting that he had not earned a degree, he made the decision to resign, rather have it become a political issue for the Democratic Governor.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} As a consequence, Troupe resigned from the poet laureate's position in October 2002 and retired from his post at UCSD.

Shortly after the controversy, Troupe moved back to New York City.

The year 2006 saw the publishing of his collaboration with self-made millionaire [[Chris Gardner]] on the latter's autobiography, ''The Pursuit of Happyness''. The book served as the inspiration for a [[The Pursuit of Happyness|film of the same name]] later that year starring [[Will Smith]].

Other notable works by Troupe include ''James Baldwin: The Legacy'' (1989) and ''Miles and Me: A Memoir of Miles Davis'' (2000). He also edited ''Giant Talk: An Anthology of Third World Writing'' (1975) and is a founding editor of ''Confrontation: A Journal of Third World Literature'' and ''American Rag''.

Troupe currently lives in New York City with his wife, Margaret.
