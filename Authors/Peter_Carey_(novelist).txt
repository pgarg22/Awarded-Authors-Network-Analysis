==Early life and career: 1943–1970==
Peter Carey was born in [[Bacchus Marsh]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], in 1943. His parents ran a [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] dealership, Carey Motors. He attended Bacchus Marsh State School from 1948 to 1953, then boarded at [[Geelong Grammar School]] between 1954 and 1960. In 1961, Carey enrolled in a science degree at the new [[Monash University]] in Melbourne, majoring in chemistry and zoology, but cut his studies short because of a car accident and a lack of interest. It was at university that he met his first wife, Leigh Weetman, who was studying German and philosophy, and who also dropped out.<ref>Mary Ellen Snodgrass, ''Peter Carey: A Literary Companion'' (Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland, 2010), pp. 6-8.</ref>

In 1962, he began to work in advertising. He was employed by various Melbourne agencies between 1962 and 1967, including on campaigns for [[Volkswagen]] and [[Lindemans (wine)|Lindeman's Wine]].<ref>Snodgrass, p. 9.</ref> His advertising work brought him into contact with older writers who introduced him to recent European and American fiction: "I didn't really start getting an education until I worked in advertising with people like Barry Oakley and [[Morris Lurie]]—and [[Bruce Petty]] had an office next door."<ref>Candida Baker, ''Yacker: Australian Writers Talk about Their Work'' (Sydney: Picador, 1986), pp. 54-77.</ref>

During this time, he read widely, particularly the works of [[Samuel Beckett]], [[William Faulkner]], [[James Joyce]], [[Franz Kafka]], and [[Gabriel García Márquez]], and began writing on his own, receiving his first rejection slip in 1964, the same year he married Weetman.<ref>Snodgrass, pp. 9-10.

Retrieved 30 March 2012.</ref> Over the next few years he wrote five novels—''Contacts'' (1964–1965), ''Starts Here, Ends Here'' (1965–1967), ''The Futility Machine'' (1966–1967), ''Wog'' (1969), and ''Adventures on Board the Marie'' [sic] ''Celeste'' (1971). None of them were published. Sun Books accepted ''The Futility Machine'' but did not proceed with publication, and ''Adventures on Board the Marie Celeste'' was accepted by Outback Press before being withdrawn by Carey himself.<ref>Carey Papers, Fryer Library, University of Queensland, [https://archive.today/20120711102735/http://findaid.library.uwa.edu.au/dynaweb/findaid/carey1/@Generic__BookTextView/292;cs=default;ts=default;pt=851 Series A: Novels], A.1: Unpublished Novels.

''Fabulating Beauty: Perspectives on the Fiction of Peter Carey'' (Amsterdam and New York: Rodopi, 2005). Retrieved 30 March 2012.</ref>

Carey's only publications during the 1960s were "Contacts" (a short extract from the unpublished novel of the same name, in ''Under Twenty-Five: An Anthology'', 1966) and "She Wakes" (a short story, in ''Australian Letters'', 1967). Towards the end of the decade, Carey and Weetman abandoned Australia with "a certain degree of self-hatred",<ref>Sonia Harford, ''Leaving Paradise: My Expat Adventure and Other Stories'' (Melbourne: Melbourne University Publishing, 2006), p. 111.</ref> travelling through Europe and Iran before settling in London in 1968, where Carey continued to write highly regarded advertising copy and unpublished fiction.

==Middle career: 1970–1990==
Returning to Australia in 1970, Carey once again did advertising work in Melbourne and Sydney. He also kept writing, and gradually broke through with editors, publishing short stories in magazines and newspapers such as ''[[Meanjin]]'' and ''[[Nation Review]]''. Most of these were collected in his first book, ''The Fat Man in History'', which appeared in 1974. In the same year Carey moved to [[Balmain, New South Wales|Balmain]] in Sydney to work for [[Grey Global Group|Grey Advertising]].

In 1976, Carey moved to [[Queensland]] and joined an alternative community named Starlight in [[Yandina, Queensland|Yandina]], north of [[Brisbane]], with his new partner, the painter [[Margot Hutcheson]], with whom he lived in the 1970s and 1980s. He remained with Grey, writing in Yandina for three weeks, then spending the fourth week at the agency in Sydney. It was during this time that he produced most of the stories collected in ''War Crimes'' (1979), as well as ''[[Bliss (novel)|Bliss]]'' (1981), his first published novel.<ref>Nicholas Wroe, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/jan/06/fiction.petercarey "Fiction's Great Outlaw"], ''The Guardian'', 5 January 2001. Retrieved 30 March 2012.</ref>

Carey started his own advertising agency in 1980, the Sydney-based McSpedden Carey Advertising Consultants, in partnership with Bani McSpedden. After many years of separation, Leigh Weetman asked for a divorce in 1980 so that she could remarry and Peter agreed. In 1981, he moved to [[Bellingen, New South Wales|Bellingen]] in northern [[New South Wales]]. There he wrote ''[[Illywhacker]]'', published in 1985.<ref>Rebecca Vaughan [http://ehlt.flinders.edu.au/english/PeterCarey/Biography.html "Biography"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116101229/http://ehlt.flinders.edu.au/english/PeterCarey/Biography.html |date=16 January 2013 }}, Peter Carey Website, 11 November 1997. Retrieved 30 March 2012.</ref> In the same year he married theatre director Alison Summers.  ''[[Illusion (musical)|Illusion]]'', a stage musical Carey wrote with Mike Mullins and composer [[Martin Armiger]], was performed at the 1986 [[Adelaide Festival of the Arts]] and a studio cast recording of the musical was nominated for a 1987 [[ARIA Award for Best Original Soundtrack, Cast or Show Album|ARIA Award]] (for which Carey as lyricist was nominated).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hawley|first1=Janet|title=In search of the truth and an entrepreneur|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ymtWAAAAIBAJ&pg=4001%2C5664924|access-date=8 August 2015|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=24 February 1986}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQnfp4K4G4o | title = ARIA Awards 1987.mov | publisher = [[YouTube]].

The decade—and the Australian phase of Carey's career—culminated with the publication of ''[[Oscar and Lucinda]]'' (1988), which won the [[Booker Prize|Booker McConnell Prize]] (as it was then known) and brought the author international recognition. Carey explained that the novel was inspired, in part, by his time in Bellingen:

{{quote|I was living in Bellingen in the country. And the little church was down the road, and they wanted to take it away, zip: and I looked at that landscape and I thought – only 200 years ago this was a landscape that was full of Aboriginal stories. So I thought about a moment when that church that I knew, which was being removed from my landscape, might have arrived. I wanted it to arrive intact, whole. And I thought it would come on a barge. And, this is a totally irrational thought, it’s like a dream. I wanted this church, a wooden church, just what I saw, a church in that valley, to come along the Bellingen River on a barge gliding like a dream into the landscape.<ref>Quoted in Sue Gillett, "''Oscar and Lucinda'': Shattering History’s Self-reflection", in Patrick Fuery (ed.), ''Representation, Discourse and Desire: Contemporary Australian Culture and Critical Theory'' (Melbourne: Longman Cheshire, 1994), p. 195.</ref>}}

==Move to New York: 1990–present==
Carey sold his share of McSpedden Carey and in 1990 moved with Alison Summers and their son to New York, where he took a job teaching creative writing at [[New York University]]. He later said that New York would not have been his first choice of place to live, and that moving there was his wife's idea.<ref>Judith Moore, [http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2005/mar/17/wrong-about-japan-fathers-journey-his-son/ "Wrong About Japan: A Father's Journey with His Son"], ''San Diego Reader'', 17 March 2005.

''[[The Tax Inspector]]'' (1991), begun in Australia, was the first book he completed in the United States. It was followed by ''[[The Unusual Life of Tristan Smith]]'' (1994), a fable in which he explored the relationship between Australia and America, disguised in the novel as "Efica" and "Voorstand". This is a relationship that has preoccupied him throughout his career, going back to ''[[Bliss (novel)|Bliss]]'' (1981), ''[[Illywhacker]]'' (1985), and the early short stories. Nevertheless, Carey continued to set his fiction primarily in Australia and remained diffident about writing explicitly on American themes. In a piece on ''[[True History of the Kelly Gang]]'' (2001), Mel Gussow reported that:

{{quote|Periodically he has thought about writing an American-based novel, and he had started one dealing with litigation. But he put it aside for [[Ned Kelly]]. Explaining why he continues to set most of his books in Australia, he recalled that one of his students said, "When you change countries you lose your peripheral vision." In that sense, his view of America is still limited. Writing about Australia—its history and its heroes—his perspective is wide and deep.<ref>Mel Gussow, [https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/15/books/championing-fabled-bandit-for-novelist-rogue-australian-sums-up-his-underdog.html "Championing a Fabled Bandit; For Novelist, a Rogue Australian Sums Up His Underdog Culture"], ''The New York Times'',
15 February 2001. Retrieved 29 March 2012.</ref>}}

It was only after nearly two decades in the United States that he embarked on ''[[Parrot and Olivier in America]]'' (2010), loosely based on events in the life of [[Alexis de Tocqueville]]. Carey says "Tocqueville opened a door I could enter. I saw the present in the past. It was accessible, imaginable."<ref>Charles McGrath, [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/books/27carey.html "Peter Carey: At Home in Australia, New York and Writing"], ''The New York Times'', 26 April 2010. Retrieved 29 March 2012.</ref> Carey continues to extend his canvas; in his novel, ''The Chemistry of Tears'' (2012), "contemporary London is brought intimately in touch with ... a 19th-century Germany redolent of the Brothers Grimm".<ref>Rebecca K. Morrison, [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-chemistry-of-tears-by-peter-carey-7600562.html "The Chemistry of Tears, by Peter Carey"], ''The Independent'', 30 March 2012.

==Controversies==
In 1998, Carey was accused of snubbing [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] by declining an invitation to meet her after winning the [[Commonwealth Writers Prize]] for ''[[Jack Maggs]]'' (1997). While Carey is a [[Australian republicanism|republican, in the Australian sense]], he insists that no offence was intended:

{{quote|What happened, he explains, was that he had already been in England recently for a literary festival; he is booked for another trip soon, and had been travelling so much that he asked the prize organisers, "Would it be possible to see Her Majesty when I was actually in London?" "They thought it would be better just to cancel than for me to ask Her Majesty to do that. Then all this stuff started going out in English tabloids."<ref>Alan Attwood, "Carey on Dickens, the Queen and Ned Kelly", ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 5 June 1998.</ref>}}

The meeting did eventually take place, with the Queen remarking, according to Carey, "I believe you had a little trouble getting here."<ref>[http://www.indianexpress.com/oldStory/18542/ "The Great Australian Story is of Loss, Death"], ''Indian Express'', 17 February 2003. Retrieved 29 March 2012.</ref>

The unhappy circumstances of Carey's break-up with Alison Summers received publicity (largely in Australia) in 2006 when ''[[Theft: A Love Story]]'' appeared, depicting the toxic relationship between its protagonist, Butcher Bones, and his ex-wife, known only as "the Plaintiff".<ref>Susan Wyndham, [https://www.smh.com.au/news/entertainment/a-lovehate-story/2006/03/30/1143441267032.html "A Love–Hate Story"], ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 1 April 2006.

Retrieved 30 March 2012. See also Wyndham, "Ex-wife Comes Out Swinging", and Goldenberg, "Two Scribes Go to War".</ref>

In April 2015 he, alongside [[Michael Ondaatje]], [[Francine Prose]], [[Teju Cole]], [[Rachel Kushner]] and [[Taiye Selasi]], withdrew from the PEN American Center gala honouring the French satirical magazine ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'' with its "Freedom of Expression Courage" award.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/27/peter-carey-among-writers-to-protest-pen-honour-for-charlie-hebdo</ref> He stated that one of his reasons for doing so was "PEN’s seeming blindness to the cultural arrogance of the French nation, which does not recognise its moral obligation to a large and disempowered segment of their population.".<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/27/nyregion/six-pen-members-decline-gala-after-award-for-charlie-hebdo.html?_r=0</ref> In addition, 204<ref>https://theintercept.com/2015/04/30/145-pen-writers-thus-far-objected-charlie-hedbo-award-6/</ref> PEN members, including Teju Cole and Deborah Eisenberg,<ref>https://theintercept.com/2015/04/27/read-letters-comments-pen-writers-protesting-charlie-hebdo-award/</ref> wrote to PEN, objecting to its decision to give the award to Charlie Hebdo.
