'''Todd Bash''' (born 1965) is an [[avant-garde]] [[playwright]] from [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].

He has written more than twenty works for the theatre, many performed and published, as well as prose, poetry and film projects.  He is also the creator of numerous [[collage]]s, art objects and musical experiments.

His early writing features a gritty, realistic style, and includes ''The Winning Number, Concrete'' and ''Blackouts''.<ref>[http://www.doollee.com/PlaywrightsB/bash-todd.html Doollee.com - The Internet Playwrights Database]</ref>

By the late 1980s, Bash's approach changed radically, moving further and further into avant-garde territory.  Often shattering the conventions of traditional theatre, and featuring dream-like imagery, his current style recalls the experiments of the Paris [[Surrealists]] during the 1920s.<ref>''Surrealism and Dreams''  Σουρεαλισμ ανδ δρεαμσ  December 2011; Cyprus Centre Theatre Institute κυπριακο κεντρο ινστιτουτου Θεατρου (in Greek).</ref>  Among his plays from this period are ''Das Nachtgespenst, Goldring, Nachthunde'' and ''The Final Thoughts Of Stanislaw Bashkiewicz''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books/about/Sanctus_fumigagi.html?id=KGVmqgndDO0C ''Sanctus Fumigaci: Collected Works of Todd Bash, Volume 2''; Dog Ear Publishing, 2007.] {{ISBN|978-1-59858-245-1}}</ref>  His short opera libretto ''Seehunde'' was set to music by Japanese born composer [[Shigeru Kan-no]].<ref>[http://imslp.org/wiki/Seehunde,_WVE-208b_(Kan-no,_Shigeru) IMSLP - Petrucci Music Library] (Lieder from Opera).</ref>
