==Biography==

===Early career===
Foucher was born in Paris and began his career as an employee in the offices of the War Department.<ref name=Glaeser>Glaeser, p. 258.</ref> One day he visited the poet [[Alexandre Soumet]], who asked Foucher whether he had read his brother-in-law's play ''Amy Robsart''. (Foucher's older sister [[Adèle Foucher|Adèle]] had married [[Victor Hugo]] in 1822.) "If you have not read it, there are some fine scenes in it."<ref name=NYTimesObit>{{Cite news |title=A French Litterateur: The Late Paul Foucher |newspaper=The New York Times |date=20 February 1875 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20914F8385A117B93C2AB1789D85F418784F9}}</ref> Later Foucher asked Hugo if he could look at the play, and Hugo, who had been planning to burn it, instead gave it to Foucher and consented to let him revise it.<ref name=NYTimesObit/> Hugo had written the first three acts himself at the age of nineteen. He had then shown it to Soumet, who had disliked it, so Hugo had given his approval for Soumet to alter and finish it. The play combined comedy and tragedy, and Foucher, under the influence of the enormous success of Shakespeare as recently performed in Paris, revised it further and produced it under his own name in 1829, but it was such a complete failure, that Hugo "came forward and avowed his own share in the production, taking responsibility of the non-success."<ref name=Barbou>[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_RkABAAAAQAAJ/page/n212 Barbou, p. 107.]</ref><ref name=Pitou>Pitou, p. 528.</ref> Nevertheless, the whole affair did gain the young Foucher some notability.<ref name=NYTimesObit/> The play was never published, although Hugo gave the manuscript to [[Alexandre Dumas, père]], "who had it for a long time in his possession."<ref name=Barbou/>

===Career as a dramatist===
Foucher soon obtained employment as a journalist and proceeded to write a new play, ''Yseul Raimbaud'', which was first presented at the [[Théâtre de l'Odéon]] on 17 November 1830.<ref>Foucher, Paul (1830). ''Yseult Raimbaud, drame historique en quatre Actes et en vers''. Paris: R. Riga. [https://books.google.com/books?id=tgpBAAAAYAAJ&dq=raimbaud%20%22paul%20foucher%22&pg=PA3#v=onepage&q&f=false View] at [[Google Books]].</ref> It was attacked by the ''classiques'' (as the opponents of [[romanticism]] were then called), "but all agreed that there was talent and vigor in it. From that time the author's success was assured."<ref name=NYTimesObit/>

He rapidly showed himself to be imaginative and prolific, producing in quick succession ''Saynètes'' (1832),<ref>Foucher, Paul (1832). ''Saynètes''. Paris: Madame Charles-Béchet. [https://books.google.com/books?id=s5gZAAAAYAAJ&pg=PP7#v=onepage&q&f=false View] at [[Google Books]].</ref> ''La Misère dans l'Amour'' (1832), and ''Les Passions dans le Monde'' (1833). As ''The New York Times'' was later to write: "Few literary men have been so active, or made so good a use of their time."<ref name=NYTimesObit/> His play ''Don Sébastien de Portugal'', first produced at the [[Théâtre de la Porte Saint-Martin]] on 9 November 1838,<ref>Foucher, Paul (1838). ''Don Sébastien de Portugal''. Paris: J. N. Barba; Delloye; Bezou. [https://books.google.com/books?id=tng_AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA643#v=onepage&q&f=false View] at [[Google Books]].</ref> was the inspiration for [[Eugène Scribe]]'s libretto for Gaetano Donizetti's 1843 French grand opera ''[[Dom Sébastien]]''. [[Herbert Weinstock]], in his biography of Donizetti, has speculated that Foucher in turn may have been influenced by [[John Dryden]]'s 1690 tragicomedy ''[[Don Sebastian (play)|Don Sebastian]]''.<ref>Weinstock, p. 193.</ref> Foucher also contributed libretti for several operas and ballets, which "were not always impressive successes," but some for the [[Paris Opera]] "revealed a lively imagination and a feeling for the picturesque situations dear to the audiences of his time."<ref name=Pitou/> These included [[Pierre-Louis Dietsch]]'s opera ''[[Le Vaisseau fantôme]]'' (9 November 1842),<ref>Pitou, p. 1340.</ref> [[Adolphe Adam]]'s opera ''Richard en Palestine'' (7 October 1844),<ref>Pitou, p. 1110.</ref> [[Edouard Deldevez]]'s ballet-pantomime ''[[Paquita]]'' (a collaboration with [[Joseph Mazilier]], who also did the choreography, first performed on 1 April 1846),<ref>Pitou, p. 1011.</ref> and [[Nicolò Gabrielli|Count Nicolas Gabrielli's]] pantomime-ballet ''L'Étoile de Messine'' (20 November 1861).<ref>Pitou, p. 432.</ref> Most of Foucher's dramatic works were written in collaboration with well-known authors including Mazilier, [[Adolphe d'Ennery|D'Ennery]], [[Félix Arvers|Arvers]], [[Auguste Anicet-Bourgeois|Anicet-Bourgeois]], [[Élie Berthet|Berthet]], [[Prosper Goubaux|Goubaux]], [[Louis Desnoyers|Desnoyers]], [[Alexandre de Lavergne|Lavergne]], [[François-Joseph Regnier|Régnier]], [[Pasquale Borri|Borri]], [[Alexandre Jarry|Jarry]], [[Victor Herbin|Herbin]], [[Joseph Bouchardy|Bouchardy]], [[Paul Duport|Duport]], [[Michel Delaporte|Delaporte]], [[Jules-Édouard Alboize de Pujol|Alboize]], and [[Adolphe Jaime|Jaime]].<ref name=Glaeser/>

===Career as a journalist and writer of nonfiction===
In 1848 he began to engage in politics, becoming the Paris correspondent for ''L'Indépendance belge'' in Brussels.<ref name=Glaeser/> His submissions were "very remarkable" and "full of life and spirit, and also full of information."<ref name=NYTimesObit/> He also became a noted theatre and music critic, first for ''L'Opinion nationale'', for which he later wrote a Monday column entitled "Revue dramatique et lyrique",<ref name=Glaeser/> then for ''La France'' in 1865,<ref name=Pitou/> and finally for ''La Presse''. "After [[Jules Janin]] he was the critic who was most respected and feared."<ref name=NYTimesObit/> Many of his reviews were collected and published in 1867 in book form as ''Entre cour et jardin: études et souvenirs du théâtre'' (''Between Court and Garden: Studies and Recollections of the Theatre'').<ref>Foucher, Paul (1867). ''Entre cour et jardin: études et souvenirs du théâtre''. Paris: Amyot. [https://archive.org/details/entrecouretjard05gedagoog View] at [[Internet Archive]].</ref> In 1873 he published a collection of sketches of famous dramatists as ''Les Coulisses du passé'' (''In the Wings of the Past'')<ref>Foucher, Paul (1873). ''Les Coulisses du passé''. Paris: E. Dentu. [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_FtAtAAAAMAAJ View] at [[Internet Archive]].</ref> and the book ''Les Sièges héroiques'' (''Heroic Sieges''), which tells the stories of celebrated sieges from the [[Siege of Orléans|liberation of Orléans]] by [[Joan of Arc]] in 1429 to the [[Siege of Strasbourg|bombardment of Strasbourg]] in 1870.<ref>Foucher, Paul (1873). ''Les Sièges héroiques''. Paris: Sandoz et Fischbacher. {{OCLC|457300529 }}.</ref>

===Career as a novelist===
Foucher published two serialized novels in ''La France'' and ''L'Opinion nationale''.<ref name=Glaeser/> These were later published in book form: ''Le Guetteur de Cordouan'' (''The Watchman of [[Cordouan lighthouse|Cordouan]]'') in 1853,<ref>Foucher, Paul (1853). ''Le Guetteur de Cordouan''. Brussels: Méline, Cans. {{OCLC|5956677}}.</ref> and ''La Vie du plaisir'' (''The Life of Pleasure'') in 1860.<ref>Foucher, Paul (1860). ''La Vie du plaisir''. Paris: Michel Levy frères. [https://books.google.com/books?id=6VktAAAAMAAJ&pg=PP9#v=onepage&q&f=false View] at [[Google Books]].</ref>

===Personal traits===
Foucher had several distinctive personal traits. He was so [[Myopia|near-sighted]], that in Paris he became a standard for comparison: ''myope comme Paul Foucher.'' His handwriting was so bad that the journals at which he worked had to employ a special copyist whose sole job was to carry out "Foucher translations". And he was notoriously absent-minded. Once he attended a ball thrown by the Turkish Ambassador, [[Ve'ly-Pasha]]. When it came time to leave, he searched his pockets for his coat-check number, but could not find it. The cloak-room attendant was unable to help him, so as the evening wore on Foucher requested the help of three Turkish guests in turn, each more decorated and high-ranking than the previous, but all without success. Finally the attendant said: ""You are a regular nightmare, you had better sit down and wait." Still without his coat at daybreak, Foucher finally decided to go home, where at last he discovered his coat and realized why he had lost his number. Many such stories were told about Foucher, "who took them all amiably and kindly."<ref name=NYTimesObit/>

Foucher was named Chevalier of the [[Legion of Honor]] on 29 April 1847.<ref name=Glaeser/> He died in Paris and was buried at [[Montparnasse Cemetery]]. [[Victor Hugo]] followed the hearse on foot, until eventually the acclamations of the crowds of the ''[[Quartier Latin]]'' forced him to retire to one of the mourning coaches. According to ''The New York Times'', due to Foucher's "incessant labor", he "left his family in comfortable circumstances."<ref name=NYTimesObit/>
