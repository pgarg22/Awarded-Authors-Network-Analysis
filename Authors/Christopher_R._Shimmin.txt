*''[[The Charm (play)|The Charm]]'' (1912) – Manx Comedy, One Act. Published by the [[Manx Gaelic Society|Manx Language Society]], in Douglas, and sold for sixpence.<ref name="Manx Quarterly 19">[http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/mquart/mq19176.htm ''Manx Quarterly'', No. 19 Vol. IV, 1918]</ref> It was successfully performed in [[Peel, Isle of Man|Peel]], [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]] and [[Liverpool]] in 1912–13.<ref name="Manx Quarterly 13" />

It concerns a band of poor fishermen with 'unmistakable Celtic features' who have turned to smuggling to earn a living under the yolk of English-imposed taxes. The smugglers out-sail and out-wit the English authorities, with the collusion of other Manx fishermen and farmers, using peaceful means and making an asset of their [[Manx language]] and natural knowledge of the sea.
*''Illiam Kodhere's Will'' (1913) – Manx Play, Four Acts. Published by the Manx Language Society, in Douglas, and sold for sixpence.<ref name="Manx Quarterly 19" /> Having been given its premier at the [[Gaiety Theatre, Isle of Man|Gaiety Theatre]], [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]] on 13 January 1913,<ref>[http://manxliterature.com/sort-by-genre/plays/illiam-kodheres-will/ Description of ''Illiam Kodhere's Will'' on manxliterature.com]</ref> the play was successfully performed in Peel, Douglas and Liverpool in 1912–13. In the performance by the Peel Players, Shimmin took the leading role of Dan Quilliam.<ref name="Manx Quarterly 13" />
*''Luss ny Graih'' (1913) – Manx Comedy, Two Acts. The title translates as "The Love Herb" in Manx.  It was originally published in [[Mannin (journal)|''Mannin'']],<ref>[http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/mannin/v2p097.htm ‘Luss ny Graih’], in ''Mannin'' No. 2, November 1913</ref> and then in booklet form by the Manx Language Society, in Douglas, which was sold for sixpence.<ref name="Manx Quarterly 19" /> It was first performed by [[The Peel Players]] on 3 December 1914.<ref>[http://manxliterature.com/sort-by-genre/plays/luss-ny-graih/ Description of ''Luss ny Graih'' on manxliterature.com]</ref><br /> In 1913 the play was entered into a Manx Society competition and judged to be the best entry by the auspicious panel of [[William Henry Gill (composer)|W. H. Gill]], [[Alfred Perceval Graves|A. P. Graves]] and [[William Boyd Dawkins]] (though it was not awarded first prize, as it exceeded the word limit). [[Sophia Morrison]] announced the play's success in the November 1913 edition of ''Mannin'':
<blockquote>
"Luss ny Graih" by Mr. Christopher R. Shimmin, of Peel, secured 270 marks (out of 300), but his play exceeded the word limit and was therefore ruled out for a first prize. On the recommendation of the judges, however, the Manx Language Society gave a prize of £10 to "Luss ny Graih." It is an extremely clever play, with an amusing plot. It will be acted by the Peel Players during the present winter, and the words will be found in the present number of ''Mannin''.<ref>[http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/mannin/v2p063.htm ‘Creating a Manx Drama’] by Sophia Morrison, in ''Mannin'' No. 2, November 1913</ref>
