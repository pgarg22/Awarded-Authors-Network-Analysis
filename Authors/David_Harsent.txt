==Background==
During his early career he was part of a circle of poets centred on [[Ian Hamilton (critic)|Ian Hamilton]] and forming something of a school, promoting conciseness and [[Imagism|imagist]]-like clarity in verse, though his work has changed and developed a good deal since then.{{Citation needed|reason=who described him as being part of a school, and who has described his work in such a way. At the moment it reads as being the POV of the writer rather than being an independent and verifiable assessment of his work.|date=February 2011}}

He has published twelve collections of poetry which have won several literary prizes and awards. ''Legion'' won the Forward Prize for best collection 2005 and was shortlisted for both the T. S. Eliot and Whitbread Awards. ''Night'' (2012)  was triple short-listed for major awards in the UK and won the Griffin International Poetry Prize. ''Fire Songs'' won the T. S. Eliot Prize in 2014. ''Sprinting from the Graveyard.'' his versions of poems written by the Bosnian poet Goran Simic while under siege in Sarajevo, appeared in 1997 and was adapted to opera, radio and television. ''In Secret'', his versions of Yannis Ritsos, was published in 2012. His work in music theatre has involved collaborations with a number of composers (but most often with Sir [[Harrison Birtwistle]]) and has been performed at the [[Royal Opera House]], [[Carnegie Hall]], the [[Southbank Centre]], [[The Proms]], the [[Wiener Kammeroper]], the Southbank Centre, the Aldeburgh Festival, the Holland Festival, and broadcast on [[BBC Two]], [[Channel 4]] and Trio (USA). ''[[The Minotaur (opera)|The Minotaur]]'' (also with Birtwistle), opened at The Royal Opera House in 2008. Birtwistle once again turned to Harsent's words for his major song cycle ''Songs from the Same Earth'' (2012–13) and for the chamber operas ''The Corridor'' and ''The Cure''.. The New York Times described Harsent and Birtwistle as a 'team creating alchemy'. Other words for music include operas ''Crime Fiction'' and ''In the Locked Room'' (music by Huw Watkins) and ''When She Died'' (music by Jonathan Dove), together with the song cycle ''Man Made:'' an early response to the climate crisis (music by Christian Mason) and an oratorio, ''The Judas Passion'' (music by Sally Beamish).  Harsent is a [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature]] and Fellow of the Hellenic Authors Society. He was appointed Distinguished Writing Fellow at [[Sheffield Hallam University]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shu.ac.uk/research/hrc/sp-david-harsent.html |title=David Harsent|website=Shu.ac.uk |access-date=11 February 2013}}</ref>
