His novel ''[[Incident at Hawk's Hill]]'' (1971) was initially marketed to adults and selected by [[Reader's Digest Condensed Books]]. A runner-up for the [[Newbery Medal]], it was afterward marketed as a children's novel and adapted by Disney for a television movie known as ''[[The Boy Who Talked to Badgers]]'' (1975).

Eckert wrote several books of natural history. In addition, he wrote more than 225 episodes of ''[[Wild Kingdom|Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom]]'', for which he received an [[Emmy Award]].

His numerous historical novels were popular, including several that were part of his series "The Winning of America". In 1996, one of them was adapted for the stage as ''1913: The Great Dayton Flood'' and premiered at [[Wright State University]], also being produced at the [[Kennedy Center]] in Washington, DC. He wrote the drama ''Tecumseh'' for an outdoor production at Sugarloaf Mountain Amphitheatre near [[Chillicothe, Ohio]] that has been a destination for tourists every summer since 1973.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tecumsehdrama.com/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=September 24, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426021019/http://tecumsehdrama.com/ |archive-date=April 26, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Biography==
Eckert was born in [[Buffalo, New York]], in 1931, and raised in the [[Chicago, Illinois]] area. He attended college near [[Bellefontaine, Ohio]], and remained a longtime resident there.

As a young man, he hitchhiked around the United States, living off the land and learning about wildlife. He began writing about nature and American history at the age of thirteen. He eventually wrote numerous books for children and adults. His children's novel, ''[[Incident at Hawk's Hill]]'', was a runner-up for the [[Newbery Medal]] in 1972.<ref>{{cite web|title=Newbery Awards|url=http://www.ala.org/alsc/awardsgrants/bookmedia/newberymedal/newberyhonors/newberymedal|accessdate=2012-05-15}}</ref> One of his novels tells how the [[great auk]] became extinct.

Eckert published numerous novels of the [[Ohio Country|Ohio Country frontier]] in what was called his "The Winning of America" series, including accounts of frontiersmen and notable Native Americans, such as [[Tecumseh]]. He conducted extensive research for his works, but inserted fictional dialogue for his historical figures.

Eckert also wrote several unproduced screenplays. He wrote more than 225 episodes of ''[[Wild Kingdom|Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom]]'', for which he received an [[Emmy Award]].

In a 1999 poll conducted by the Ohioana Library Association, Eckert shared with [[Toni Morrison]] the accolade of "Favorite Ohio Writer of All Time."

Eckert died in his sleep on July 7, 2011, in [[Corona, California]], at the age of 80.<ref name=Gazette/>

==Dramatizations and adaptations==

Eckert wrote the outdoor drama ''Tecumseh!'' which, in 1997, celebrated its 25th year of production at the multi-million-dollar [[Sugarloaf Mountain Amphitheater]] near [[Chillicothe, Ohio]].  His 1968 children's novel ''Blue Jacket'' was adapted as a drama of the same name designed for outdoor performances. It opened in 1982 at a facility outside [[Xenia, Ohio]]. The production eventually closed due to financial difficulties, but it was estimated to have generated more than nine million dollars yearly into the local economy of southwest Ohio.<ref>"''Blue Jacket'' puts $9 million yearly into Greene County economy,'' Helen Bebbington, ''The Dayton Daily News'', June 12, 2003.</ref>

Eckert's 1965 book ''A Time of Terror: The Great Dayton Flood'' was in 1996 adapted for the stage as ''1913: The Great Dayton Flood'' by W. Stuart McDowell and Timothy Nevits. It was performed at [[Wright State University]], featuring recorded narration by actors [[Martin Sheen]], [[Ossie Davis]] and [[Ruby Dee]].<ref>This production was documented in 1997 reprint edition of ''A Time of Terror: The Great Dayton Flood'', Landfall Press, 1997.</ref> The production won a number of awards from the [[American College Theatre Festival]] XXIX at the Riffe Center, Columbus, Ohio. It opened the 1997 festival in the [[Kennedy Center]], returning to Dayton that fall, where it played in the [[Victoria Theatre (Dayton, Ohio)|Victoria Theatre]].<ref>''Program of the XXIX American College Theatre Festival,'' January 2009, p. 60.</ref>

==Criticism==

While Eckert emphasized the historical basis of his books and stressed the years of research he conducted, he created dialogue and internal thought for his ostensibly historic figures. Reviewers have described his work as "an entertaining blend of fact and fiction."<ref>[[Publishers Weekly]] review (1992) of ''A Sorrow in Our Heart: The Life of Tecumseh''.</ref> What Eckert described as "narrative biography” was criticized by Kirkus Reviews as  “an apparent euphemism for poetic license”, when discussing his book about Tecumseh.<ref name="review1991">Review of ''A Sorrow in Our Heart: The Life of Tecumseh'' (1991), [[Kirkus Reviews]]<!-- needs date --></ref> ''A Sorrow in Our Heart: The Life of Tecumseh'' was described as "A biography that succeeds better as fiction".<ref name="review1991"/> The reviewer said that the book "in its interpretative zeal … strays from … the historical record to the point of being suspect".<ref name="review1991"/>
