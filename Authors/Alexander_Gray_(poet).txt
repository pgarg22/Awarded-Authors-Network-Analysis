This quote features on the [[Canongate Wall]] at the new [[Scottish Parliament]] building:

<blockquote>
This is my country,<br/>
The land that begat me.<br/>
These windy spaces<br/>
Are surely my own.<br/>
And those who toil here<br/>
In the sweat of their faces<br/>
Are flesh of my flesh,<br/>
And bone of my bone.
</blockquote>
