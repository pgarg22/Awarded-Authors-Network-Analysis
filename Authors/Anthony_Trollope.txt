'''Anthony Trollope''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|r|ɒ|l|ə|p}}; 24 April 1815 – 6 December 1882)<ref>{{cite DNB |wstitle=Trollope, Anthony |first=Richard |last=Garnett |volume=57 |pages=238–242}}</ref> was an [[English people|English]] [[novelist]] and [[civil servant]] of the [[Victorian era]]. Among his best-known works is a series of novels collectively known as the ''[[Chronicles of Barsetshire]]'', which revolves around the imaginary county of [[Barsetshire]]. He also wrote novels on political, social, and gender issues, and other topical matters.<ref>Nardin, Jane (1990). "The Social Critic in Anthony Trollope's Novels," ''SEL: Studies in English Literature 1500–1900'', Vol. XXX, No. 4, pp. 679–696.</ref>

Trollope's literary reputation dipped somewhat during the last years of his life,<ref>"What about Anthony Trollope? Was not Anthony Trollope popular, even during the days of Dickens and Thackeray? And who ever preached a reactionary crusade against him? Yet is he not fast disappearing from the attention of our novel readers? Trollope, unlike most successful novelists, was himself made sensible during his later years of a steady decline of his popularity. I heard a well-known London publisher once say that the novelist who had once obtained by any process a complete popular success never could lose it during his lifetime; that, let him write as carelessly and as badly as he might, his lifetime could not last long enough to enable him to shake off his public. But the facts of Trollope's literary career show that the declaration of my publisher friend was too sweeping in its terms. For several years before his death, Trollope's prices were steadily falling off. Now, one seldom hears him talked of; one hardly ever hears a citation from him in a newspaper or a magazine." – M'Carthy, Justin (1900). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25104969 "Disappearing Authors,"] ''The North American Review'', Vol. 170, No. 520, p. 397.</ref> but he had regained the esteem of critics by the mid-20th century.

==Biography==
Anthony Trollope was the son of [[barrister]] Thomas Anthony Trollope and the novelist and [[travel writer]] [[Frances Milton Trollope]]. Though a clever and well-educated man and a Fellow of [[New College, Oxford]], Thomas Trollope failed at the Bar due to his bad temper. Ventures into farming proved unprofitable, and he did not receive an expected inheritance when an elderly childless uncle{{Efn | Barbara, the childless wife of Anthony Trollope's great-uncle, Adolphus Meetkerke of [[Rushden, Hertfordshire#History|Julians Hertfordshire]], died in 1817. Adolphus (then aged 64) remarried in 1818 and had five children.}} remarried and had children. Thomas Trollope was the son of Rev. (Thomas) Anthony Trollope, rector of [[Cottered]], Hertfordshire, himself the sixth son of [[Trollope baronets|Sir Thomas Trollope, 4th Baronet]]. The baronetcy later came to descendants of Anthony Trollope's second son, Frederic.<ref>Anthony Trollope: The Artist in Hiding, R. C. Terry, Macmillan, 1977, p. 22</ref> As a son of [[landed gentry]],<ref>{{citation | publisher = Geograph | url = https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/131525 | place = UK | type = photogram | title = Casewick, Lincolnshire, the Trollope family seat purchased in 1621}}</ref> Thomas Trollope wanted his sons to be raised as gentlemen and to attend [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] or [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. Anthony Trollope suffered much misery in his boyhood owing to the disparity between the privileged background of his parents and their comparatively small means.

[[File:Grandon 21 Jul 2015 03.JPG|thumbnail|[[Grandon, Hadley Green|Grandon]], Monken Hadley. Home to Anthony and his mother 1836–38.]]
Born in London, Anthony attended [[Harrow School]] as a free [[day pupil]] for three years from the age of seven because his father's farm,{{Efn | The (leasehold) farm was named by the Trollopes 'Julians' after the grand estate they ultimately failed to inherit. Trollope used this Julians at Harrow as the location for the school in his novel ''[[Orley Farm (novel)|Orley Farm]]''. Coincidentally, Julians later became used as a school and Trollope consented to that school being named [[Orley Farm School]].}} acquired for that reason, lay in that neighbourhood. After a spell at a private school at [[Sunbury-on-Thames|Sunbury]], he followed his father and two older brothers to [[Winchester College]], where he remained for three years. He returned to Harrow as a day-boy to reduce the cost of his education. Trollope had some very miserable experiences at these two [[Public school (UK)|public schools]]. They ranked as two of the élite schools in England, but Trollope had no money and no friends, and was bullied a great deal. At the age of 12 he fantasised about suicide. He also daydreamed, constructing elaborate imaginary worlds.

In 1827, his mother [[Frances Trollope]] moved to America with Trollope's three younger siblings, to [[Nashoba Commune]]. After that failed, she opened a bazaar in [[Cincinnati]], which proved unsuccessful. Thomas Trollope joined them for a short time before returning to the farm at Harrow, but Anthony stayed in England throughout. His mother returned in 1831 and rapidly made a name for herself as a writer, soon earning a good income. His father's affairs, however, went from bad to worse. He gave up his legal practice entirely and failed to make enough income from farming to pay rents to his landlord, [[John Rushout, 2nd Baron Northwick|Lord Northwick]]. In 1834, he fled to Belgium to avoid arrest for debt. The whole family moved to a house near [[Bruges]], where they lived entirely on Frances's earnings.

In Belgium, Anthony was offered a commission in an Austrian cavalry regiment. To accept it, he needed to learn French and German; he had a year in which to acquire these languages. To learn them without expense to himself and his family, he took a position as an usher (assistant master) in a school in Brussels, which position made him the tutor of 30 boys. After six weeks of this, however, he received an offer of a clerkship in the [[General Post Office]], obtained through a family friend. He returned to London in the autumn of 1834 to take up this post.<ref name=auto2>Trollope, Anthony (1883).

According to Trollope, "the first seven years of my official life were neither creditable to myself nor useful to the public service."<ref name=auto3>Trollope (1883). [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/t/trollope/anthony/autobiography/chapter3.html Chapter 3.] Retrieved 2 July 2010.</ref> At the Post Office, he acquired a reputation for unpunctuality and insubordination.

===Move to Ireland===
[[File:RoseTrollope.jpg|thumb|Rose Heseltine Trollope]]

In 1841, an opportunity to escape offered itself.<ref>Moore, W. S. (1928). "Trollope and Ireland", ''The Irish Monthly'', Vol. 56, No. 656, pp. 74–79.</ref> A postal surveyor's clerk in central Ireland was reported as being incompetent and in need of replacement. The position was not regarded as a desirable one at all; but Trollope, in debt and in trouble at his office, volunteered for it; and his supervisor, [[William Maberly]], eager to be rid of him, appointed him to the position.<ref name=auto3 />

Trollope based himself in [[Banagher]], [[Offaly|King's County]], with his work consisting largely of inspection tours in [[Connacht|Connaught]]. Although he had arrived with a bad [[job reference|reference]] from London, his new supervisor resolved to judge him on his merits; by Trollope's account, within a year he had the reputation of a valuable public servant.<ref name=auto4>Trollope (1883). [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/t/trollope/anthony/autobiography/chapter4.html Chapter 4.] Retrieved 2 July 2010.</ref> His salary and travel allowance went much further in Ireland than they had in London, and he found himself enjoying a measure of prosperity.<ref name=auto3 /> He took up [[fox hunting]], which he pursued enthusiastically for the next three decades. His professional role as a post-office surveyor brought him into contact with Irish people, and he found them pleasant company: "The Irish people did not murder me, nor did they even break my head. I soon found them to be good-humoured, clever—the working classes very much more intelligent than those of England—economical and hospitable."<ref name=auto4 />

At the watering place of [[Dún Laoghaire]], Trollope met Rose Heseltine,<ref name=auto4 /> the daughter of a [[Rotherham]] bank manager.<ref name=tsociety /> They became engaged when he had been in Ireland for a year; because of Trollope's debts and her lack of a fortune, they were unable to marry until 1844. Their first son, Henry Merivale, was born in 1846, and the second, Frederick James Anthony, in 1847.<ref>Anthony Trollope: The Artist in Hiding, R. C. Terry, Macmillan, 1977, p. 249, Appendix I</ref> Soon after their marriage, Trollope was transferred to another postal district in the south of Ireland, and the family moved to [[Clonmel]].<ref>Byrne, P. F. (1992). "Anthony Trollope in Ireland," ''Dublin Historical Record'', Vol. 45, No. 2, pp. 126–128.</ref>

===Early works===
Though Trollope had decided to become a novelist, he had accomplished very little writing during his first three years in Ireland. At the time of his marriage, he had only written the first of three volumes of his first novel, ''[[The Macdermots of Ballycloran]]''. Within a year of his marriage, he finished that work.<ref>Tingay, Lance O. (1951). "The Reception of Trollope's First Novel", ''Nineteenth-Century Fiction'', Vol. 6, No. 3, pp. 195–200.</ref>

Trollope began writing on the numerous long train trips around Ireland he had to take to carry out his postal duties.<ref>"Some authors appear to be able to write at any time and in any place. Anthony Trollope did much writing in a railway train." –  Andrews, William (1898). [https://archive.org/stream/literarybyways00andr#page/n5/mode/2up ''Literary Byways''], Williams Andrews & Co., pp. 22–23.</ref> Setting very firm goals about how much he would write each day, he eventually became one of the most prolific writers of all time. He wrote his earliest novels while working as a Post Office inspector, occasionally dipping into the "[[dead letter mail|lost-letter]]" box for ideas.<ref>Super, R. H. (1981). ''Trollope in the Post Office''. Ann Arbor: Univ. of Michigan Press. pp. 16–45.</ref>

[[File:Belfast (111), October 2009.JPG|thumb|Plaque on Custom House in [[Belfast]], where Trollope maintained his office as Postal Surveyor for the northern half of Ireland.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110716055911/http://www.ulsterhistory.co.uk/anthonytrollope.htm "Anthony Trollope".] [http://www.ulsterhistory.co.uk/index.htm Ulster History Circle.] Archived from [http://www.ulsterhistory.co.uk/anthonytrollope.htm the original] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716055911/http://www.ulsterhistory.co.uk/anthonytrollope.htm |date=16 July 2011 }} on 16 July 2011.</ref>]]

Significantly, many of his earliest novels have Ireland as their setting—natural enough given that he wrote them or thought them up while he was living and working in Ireland, but unlikely to enjoy warm critical reception, given the contemporary English attitude towards Ireland.<ref name="edwards38">Edwards, Owen Dudley. "Anthony Trollope, the Irish Writer. ''Nineteenth-Century Fiction'', Vol. 38, No. 1 (June 1983), p. 1</ref> Critics have pointed out that Trollope's view of Ireland separates him from many of the other Victorian novelists. Other critics claimed that Ireland did not influence Trollope as much as his experience in England, and that the society in Ireland harmed him as a writer, especially since Ireland was experiencing the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] during his time there.<ref>''Trollope: A Commentary'' London: Constable 1927 p. 136</ref> However, these critics have been accused of bigoted opinions against Ireland who fail or refuse to acknowledge both Trollope's true attachment to the country and the country's capacity as a rich literary field.<ref name="edwards38"/><ref>"Trollope and the Matter of Ireland," ''Anthony Trollope'', ed. Tony Bareham, London: Vision Press 1980, pp. 24–25</ref>

Trollope published four novels about Ireland. Two were written during the Great Famine, while the third deals with the famine as a theme (''[[The Macdermots of Ballycloran]]'', ''[[The Kellys and the O'Kellys]]'', and ''[[Castle Richmond]]'', respectively).<ref>Terry, R.C. ''Anthony Trollope: The Artist in Hiding'' London: Macmillan 1977 pp. 175–200</ref> ''The Macdermots of Ballycloran'' was written while he was staying in the village of [[Drumsna]], [[County Leitrim]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Welcome to Drumsna | work=GoIreland | url=http://www.goireland.com/leitrim/drumsna.htm | access-date=25 June 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080512065223/http://www.goireland.com/leitrim/drumsna.htm| archive-date= 12 May 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> ''[[The Kellys and the O'Kellys]]'' (1848) is a humorous comparison of the romantic pursuits of the landed gentry (Francis O'Kelly, Lord Ballindine) and his Catholic tenant (Martin Kelly). Two short stories deal with Ireland ("The O'Conors of Castle Conor, County Mayo"<ref>Published in ''Harper's'', May 1860.</ref> and "Father Giles of Ballymoy"<ref>Published in ''Argosy'', May 1866.</ref>).<ref>Trollope, ''The Spotted Dog, and Other Stories'', ed. Herbert Van Thal. London: Pan Books 1950</ref> Some critics argue that these works seek to unify an Irish and British identity, instead of viewing the two as distinct.<ref name=autogenerated1>Edwards p.3</ref> Even as an Englishman in Ireland, Trollope was still able to attain what he saw as essential to being an "Irish writer": possessed, obsessed, and "mauled" by Ireland.<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref>"Irishness" in ''Writers and Politics''. London: Chatto and Windus 1965, pp. 97–100</ref>

The reception of the Irish works left much to be desired. [[Henry Colburn]] wrote to Trollope, "It is evident that readers do not like novels on Irish subjects as well as on others."<ref name=auto4 /> In particular, magazines such as ''[[The New Monthly Magazine]]'', which included reviews that attacked the Irish for their actions during the famine, were representative of the dismissal by English readers of any work written about the Irish.<ref>''New Monthly Magazine'', August 1848.</ref><ref>''Trollope: The Critical Heritage'' ed. Donald Smalley London: Routledge 1969, p. 555</ref>

===Success as an author===
In 1851, Trollope was sent to England, charged with investigating and reorganising rural mail delivery in south-western England and south [[Wales]]. The two-year mission took him over much of Great Britain, often on horseback. Trollope describes this time as "two of the happiest years of my life".<ref name=auto5>Trollope (1883).  [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/t/trollope/anthony/autobiography/chapter5.html Chapter 5.] Retrieved 2 July 2010.</ref>

In the course of it, he visited [[Salisbury Cathedral]]; and there, according to his autobiography, he conceived the plot of ''[[The Warden]]'', which became the first of the six [[Chronicles of Barsetshire|Barsetshire novels]]. His postal work delayed the beginning of writing for a year;<ref>The dates in Trollope's ''An Autobiography'', [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/t/trollope/anthony/autobiography/chapter5.html chapter 5], are inconsistent: he states that he began writing ''The Warden'' in July 1853, that he "recommenced it" at the end of 1852, and that he finished it in the autumn of 1853.</ref> the novel was published in 1855, in an edition of 1,000 copies, with Trollope receiving half of the profits: £9 8s. 8d. in 1855, and £10 15s. 1d. in 1856. Although the profits were not large, the book received notices in the press, and brought Trollope to the attention of the novel-reading public.<ref name=auto5 />

He immediately began work on ''[[Barchester Towers]]'', the second Barsetshire novel;<ref name=auto6>Trollope (1883).  [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/t/trollope/anthony/autobiography/chapter6.html Chapter 6.] Retrieved 2 July 2010.</ref> upon its publication in 1857,<ref name=auto20>Trollope (1883).  [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/t/trollope/anthony/autobiography/chapter20.html Chapter 20.] Retrieved 2 July 2010.</ref> he received an advance payment of £100 (about £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|100|1857|r=-2}}}} in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}} consumer pounds) against his share of the profits. Like ''The Warden'', ''Barchester Towers'' did not obtain large sales, but it helped to establish Trollope's reputation. In his autobiography, Trollope writes, "It achieved no great reputation, but it was one of the novels which novel readers were called upon to read."<ref name=auto6/> For the following novel, ''[[The Three Clerks]]'', he was able to sell the copyright for a lump sum of £250; he preferred this to waiting for a share of future profits.<ref name=auto6 />

===Return to England===
Although Trollope had been happy and comfortable in Ireland, he felt that as an author, he should live within easy reach of London. In 1859, he sought and obtained a position in the Post Office as Surveyor to the Eastern District, comprising [[Essex]], Suffolk, [[Norfolk]], Cambridgeshire, [[Huntingdonshire]], and most of [[Hertfordshire]].<ref name=auto8>Trollope (1883).  [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/t/trollope/anthony/autobiography/chapter8.html Chapter 8.] Retrieved 2 July 2010.</ref>
Later in that year he moved to [[Waltham Cross]], about {{convert|12|mi|km}} from London in Hertfordshire, where he lived until 1871.<ref>[http://www.lowewood.com/walthamcross/anthony-trollope "Anthony Trollope".] [http://www.lowewood.com/ Lowewood Museum.] Retrieved 2 July 2010.</ref>

In late 1859, Trollope learned of preparations for the release of the ''[[Cornhill Magazine]]'', to be published by [[George Murray Smith]] and edited by [[William Makepeace Thackeray]].<ref>Payne, Jr.L. W. (1900). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27528123 "Thackeray,"] ''The Sewanee Review'', Vol. 8, No. 4, pp. 447–448.</ref> He wrote to the latter, offering to provide short stories for the new magazine. Thackeray and Smith both responded: the former urging Trollope to contribute, the latter offering £1,000 for a novel, provided that a substantial part of it could be available to the printer within six weeks. Trollope offered Smith ''[[Castle Richmond]]'', which he was then writing; but Smith declined to accept an Irish story, and suggested a novel dealing with English clerical life as had ''Barchester Towers''. Trollope then devised the plot of ''[[Framley Parsonage]]'', setting it near Barchester so that he could make use of characters from the Barsetshire novels.<ref name=auto8/><ref name=smith-memoir>{{cite DNBSupp|wstitle=Memoir of George Smith|first=Sidney|last=Lee|author-link=Sidney Lee}}</ref><ref name=sadleir>Sadleir, Michael (1927).  ''Trollope: A Commentary''. Farrar, Straus and Company.</ref>{{rp|207–08}}

''Framley Parsonage'' proved enormously popular, establishing Trollope's reputation with the novel-reading public and amply justifying the high price that Smith had paid for it.<ref>Moody, Ellen. [http://www.jimandellen.org/trollope/framley.introduction.html ''Framley Parsonage'' introduction.] [http://www.jimandellen.org/ellen/emhome.htm Ellen Moody's Website: Mostly on English and Continental and Women's Literature.] Retrieved 7 April 2011.</ref> The early connection to ''Cornhill'' also brought Trollope into the London circle of artists, writers, and intellectuals, not least among whom were Smith and Thackeray.<ref name=sadleir/>{{rp|209}}<ref>Cook, E. T. (1910). [https://archive.org/stream/newcornhill28londuoft#page/n23/mode/2up "The Jubilee of the 'Cornhill',"] ''The Cornhill Magazine'', Vol. XXVIII, New Series.</ref>

By the mid-1860s, Trollope had reached a fairly senior position within the Post Office hierarchy, despite ongoing differences with [[Rowland Hill (postal reformer)|Rowland Hill]], who was at that time Chief Secretary to the [[Postmaster General of the United Kingdom|Postmaster General]].<ref name=auto8 /> Postal history credits Trollope with introducing the [[pillar box]] (the ubiquitous mail-box) in the United Kingdom. He was earning a substantial income from his novels. He had overcome the awkwardness of his youth, made good friends in literary circles, and hunted enthusiastically. In 1865, Trollope was among the founders of the liberal [[Fortnightly Review]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Durey |first1=J. |title=Trollope and the Church of England |date=2002 |publisher=Springer |page=135}}</ref>

When Hill left the Post Office in 1864, Trollope's brother-in-law, [[John Tilley (civil servant)|John Tilley]], who was then Under-Secretary to the Postmaster General, was appointed to the vacant position. Trollope applied for Tilley's old post, but was passed over in favour of a subordinate, [[Frank Ives Scudamore]]. In the autumn of 1867, Trollope resigned his position at the Post Office, having by that time saved enough to generate an income equal to the pension he would lose by leaving before the age of 60.<ref name=auto15>Trollope (1883).

Party leaders apparently took advantage of Trollope's eagerness to stand, and of his willingness to spend money on a campaign.<ref name=autobeverley /> Beverley had a long history of vote-buying and of intimidation by employers and others. Every election since 1857 had been followed by a petition alleging corruption, and it was estimated that 300 of the 1,100 voters in 1868 would sell their votes.<ref name=bevhist>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=36433 Modern Beverley: Political and Social History, 1835–1918.] [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/Default.aspx British History Online.] Retrieved 20 May 2010.</ref> The task of a Liberal candidate was not to win the election, but to give the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] candidates an opportunity to display overt corruption, which could then be used to disqualify them.<ref name=super />

He spent a total of £400 on his campaign.<ref name=autobeverley /> The [[1868 United Kingdom general election|election was held on 17 November 1868]]; the novelist finished last of four candidates, with the victory going to the two Conservatives.<ref name=super /> A petition was filed, and a [[Royal Commission]] investigated the circumstances of the election; its findings of extensive and widespread corruption drew nationwide attention, and led to the disfranchisement of the borough in 1870.<ref name=bevhist /> The fictional Percycross election in ''[[Ralph the Heir]]'' and Tankerville election in Phineas Redux is closely based on the Beverley campaign.<ref name=autobeverley />

===Later years===
After the defeat at Beverley, Trollope concentrated entirely on his literary career. While continuing to produce novels rapidly, he also edited the ''St Paul's Magazine'', which published several of his novels in serial form.

"Between 1859 and 1875, Trollope visited the United States five times. Among American literary men he developed a wide acquaintance, which included [[James Russell Lowell|Lowell]], [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.|Holmes]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]], [[Louis Agassiz|Agassiz]], [[Nathaniel Hawthorne|Hawthorne]], [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow|Longfellow]], [[Bret Harte]], [[Artemus Ward]], [[Joaquin Miller]], [[Mark Twain]], [[Henry James]], [[William Dean Howells]], [[James T. Fields]], [[Charles Eliot Norton|Charles Norton]], [[John Lothrop Motley]], and [[Richard Henry Dana, Jr.]]"<ref>William Coyle, "The Friendship of Anthony Trollope and Richard Henry Dana, Jr.," ''The New England Quarterly'', Vol. 25, No. 2 (June 1952), pp. 255-262 (quotation on p. 255).</ref> 

Trollope wrote a travel book focusing on his experiences in the US during the [[American Civil War]] titled ''North America'' (1862). Aware that his mother had published a harshly [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American]] travel book about the U.S. (titled the ''[[Domestic Manners of the Americans]]'') and feeling markedly more sympathetic to the United States, Trollope resolved to write a work which would "add to the good feeling which should exist between two nations which ought to love each other." During his time in America, Trollope remained a steadfast supporter of the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], being a committed [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionist]] who was opposed to the system of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] as it existed in the [[Southern United States|South]].<ref name="Buzard 5–18">{{Cite journal|last=Buzard|first=James|date=March 2010|title=Portable Boundaries: Trollope, Race, and Travel|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08905491003703998|journal=Nineteenth-Century Contexts|volume=32|issue=1|pages=5–18|doi=10.1080/08905491003703998|s2cid=191619030|issn=0890-5495}}</ref>

In 1871, Trollope made his first trip to [[Australia]], arriving in [[Melbourne]] on 28 July 1871 on the [[SS Great Britain|SS ''Great Britain'']],<ref>{{Cite web|title=SS Great Britain : Brunel's ss Great Britain|url=https://globalstories.ssgreatbritain.org/_/traveller/24266/|access-date=2021-07-21|website=globalstories.ssgreatbritain.org}}</ref> with his wife and their cook.<ref>Muir, Marcie (1949).

This fear was based on rather negative writings about America by his mother, Fanny, and by [[Charles Dickens]]. On his return, Trollope published a book, ''Australia and New Zealand'' (1873). It contained both positive and negative comments. On the positive side, it found a comparative absence of class consciousness, and praised aspects of [[Perth]], Melbourne, [[Hobart]] and [[Sydney]].<ref name = "NS20"/> However, he was negative about Adelaide's river, the towns of [[Bendigo]] and [[Ballarat]], and the [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal population]]. What most angered the Australian papers, though, were his comments "accusing Australians of being braggarts".<ref name = "NS20"/><ref name="Buzard 5–18"/>

[[File:Anthony Trollope -Grave in Kensal Green Cemetery.jpg|thumb|Grave in [[Kensal Green Cemetery]], London]]

Trollope returned to Australia in 1875 to help his son close down his failed farming business. He found that the resentment created by his accusations of bragging remained. Even when he died in 1882, Australian papers still "smouldered", referring yet again to these accusations, and refusing to fully praise or recognize his achievements.<ref name = "NS21">Starck, p. 21</ref>

In the late 1870's, Trollope furthered his travel writing career by visiting [[southern Africa]], including the [[Cape Colony]] and the [[Boer Republics]] of the [[Orange Free State]] and the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]]. Admitting that he initially assumed that the [[Afrikaners]] had "retrograded from civilization, and had become savage, barbarous, and unkindly", Trollope wrote at length on Boer cultural habits, claiming that the "roughness... [[Sparta]]n simplicity and the dirtiness of the Boer’s way of life [merely] resulted from his preference for living in rural isolation, far from any town." In the completed work, which Trollope simply titled ''South Africa'' (1877), he described the [[Mining industry of South Africa|mining town]] of [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberly]] as being "one of the most interesting places on the face of the earth."<ref name="Buzard 5–18"/>

In 1880, Trollope moved to the village of [[South Harting]] in West Sussex. He spent some time in Ireland in the early 1880s researching his last, unfinished, novel, ''The Landleaguers''. It is said that he was extremely distressed by the violence of the [[Land War]].<ref>Stanford, Jane, 'That Irishman: The Life and Times of John O'Connor Power', Part Three, 'The Fenian is the Artist', pp. 123–124, The History Press Ireland, May 2011, {{ISBN|978-1-84588-698-1}}</ref>

==Death==
Trollope died in [[Marylebone]], London, in 1882<ref>{{Cite web|title=Search Results for England & Wales Deaths 1837-2007|url=https://www.findmypast.co.uk/search/results?datasetname=england+%26+wales+deaths+1837-2007&firstname=anthony&lastname=trollope&eventyear=1882&eventyear_offset=1|access-date=2021-07-21|website=www.findmypast.co.uk|language=en}}</ref> and is buried in [[Kensal Green Cemetery]], near the grave of his contemporary, [[Wilkie Collins]].

==Works and reputation==
{{main|Anthony Trollope bibliography}}
Trollope's first major success came with ''[[The Warden]]'' (1855)—the first of six novels set in the fictional county of "Barsetshire" (often collectively referred to as the ''[[Chronicles of Barsetshire]]''), dealing primarily with the clergy and landed gentry. ''[[Barchester Towers]]'' (1857) has probably become the best-known of these. Trollope's other major series, the [[Palliser novels]], which overlap with the Barsetshire novels, concerned itself with politics, with the wealthy, industrious [[Plantagenet Palliser]] (later Duke of Omnium) and his delightfully spontaneous, even richer wife Lady Glencora featured prominently, though, as with the Barsetshire series, many other well-developed characters populated each novel and in one, ''[[The Eustace Diamonds]]'', the Pallisers play only a small role.

[[File:Victorian post box Guernsey.jpg|thumb|upright|This [[Victorian era|VR]] [[pillar box]] originally installed in [[Guernsey]] in 1852/3 on Trollope's recommendation and one of the oldest still in use]]

Trollope's popularity and critical success diminished in his later years, but he continued to write prolifically, and some of his later novels have acquired a good reputation. In particular, critics who concur that the book was not popular when published, generally acknowledge the sweeping satire ''[[The Way We Live Now]]'' (1875) as his masterpiece.<ref>{{cite web|first=Amanda |last=Craig|author-link=Amanda Craig|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/book-of-a-lifetime-the-way-we-live-now-by-anthony-trollope-1676694.html#|title=Book of a Lifetime, The Way We Live Now by Anthony Trollope|website=independent.co.uk}}</ref> In all, Trollope wrote 47 novels, 42 short stories, and five travel books, as well as nonfiction books titled ''[[William Makepeace Thackeray|Thackeray]]'' (1879) and ''[[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]]'' (1882).

After his death, Trollope's ''An Autobiography'' appeared and was a bestseller in London.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Literary Gossip|journal=The Week: A Canadian Journal of Politics, Literature, Science and Arts|date=6 December 1883|volume=1|series=1|page=13|url=https://archive.org/stream/weekcanadianjour01toro#page/n7/mode/1up}}</ref> Trollope's downfall in the eyes of the critics stemmed largely from this volume.<ref>Saintsbury, George (1895). [https://archive.org/stream/correctedimpress00sain#page/156/mode/2up "Three Mid-Century Novelists."] In ''Corrected Impressions'', London: William Heinemann, 172–173.</ref><ref>Shumaker, Wayne (1954). [https://archive.org/stream/englishautobiogr011098mbp#page/n173/mode/2up "The Mixed Mode: Trollope's Autobiography."] In ''English Autobiography'', Berkeley: University of California Press.</ref> Even during his writing career, reviewers tended increasingly to shake their heads over his prodigious output, but when Trollope revealed that he strictly adhered to a daily writing quota, and admitted that he wrote for money, he confirmed his critics' worst fears.<ref>"He told me that he began to write at five o'clock every morning, and wrote a certain number of hours till it was time to dress, never touching his literary work after breakfast. I remember telling him that I always worked at night, and his saying, 'Well, I give the freshest hours of the day to my work; you give the fag end of the day to yours.' I have often thought over this, but my experience has always been that the early morning is the best time for study and taking in ideas, night the best time for giving out thoughts. I said that I envied him the gift of imagination, which enabled him to create characters. He said, 'Imagination! my dear fellow, not a bit of it; it is cobbler's wax.' Seeing that I was rather puzzled, he said that the secret of success was to put a lump of cobbler's wax on your chair, sit on it and stick to it till you had succeeded. He told me he had written for years before he got paid." — Brackenbury, Sir Henry (1909). [https://archive.org/stream/cu31924028000457#page/n9/mode/2up ''Some Memories of My Spare Time''], William Blackwood & Sons, pp. 51–52.</ref> Writers were expected to wait for inspiration, not to follow a schedule.<ref>"It happened that Anthony Trollope was a writer. But that circumstance was unimportant. He was pre-eminently a man. Trollope devoted himself to the business of authorship exactly as he might have devoted himself to any other business. He worked at writing for three hours each day, not a very hard daily stint. But, as it happened, he had another occupation, a position in the English postal service. He made up his mind to do his stint of writing no matter what happened. Often he would write on trains. What writers call 'waiting for an inspiration' he considered nonsense. The result of his system was that he accomplished a vast amount of work. But, by telling the truth about his system, he injured his reputation. When his 'Autobiography' was published after his death, lovers of literature were shocked, instead of being impressed by his courage and industry. They had the old-fashioned notion about writing, which still persists, by the way. They liked to think of writers as 'inspired,' as doing their work by means of a divine agency. As if we did not all do our work by a divine agency no matter what the work may be. But the divine agency insists on being backed up with character, which means courage and persistence, the qualities that make for system. In the 'Autobiography,' Anthony Trollope unquestionably showed that he was not an inspirational writer, and that he was a man inspired by tremendous moral force." – Barry, John D. (1918). [https://archive.org/stream/reactionsessays00barrrich#page/n59/mode/2up "Using Time."] In ''Reactions and Other Essays'', J.J. Newbegin, pp. 39–40.</ref>

[[Julian Hawthorne]], an American writer, critic and friend of Trollope, while praising him as a man, calling him "a credit to England and to human nature, and ... [deserving] to be numbered among the darlings of mankind", also said that "he has done great harm to English fictitious literature by his novels".<ref>Hawthorne, Julian (1887). [https://archive.org/stream/confessionscriti00hawt#page/140/mode/2up "The Maker of Many Books."] In ''Confessions and Criticisms'', Ticknor and Company, pp. 160–62.</ref><ref>His father, eminent novelist [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], saw it differently: "Have you ever read the novels of Anthony Trollope?" He asked his publisher, James T. Fields, in February 1860; "They precisely suit my taste; solid, substantial, written on strength of beef and through inspiration of ale, and just as real as if some giant had hewn a great lump out of the earth and put it under a glass case, with all its inhabitants going about their daily business, and not suspecting that they were made a show of." — Heddendorf, David (2013). "Anthony Trollope's Scarlet Letter," ''Sewanee Review'', Vol. 121, No. 3, p. 368.</ref>

[[Henry James]] also expressed mixed opinions of Trollope.<ref>Jones, Vivien (1982). "James and Trollope," ''The Review of English Studies'', Vol. 33, No. 131, pp. 278–294.</ref> The young James wrote some scathing reviews of Trollope's novels (''The Belton Estate'', for instance, he called "a stupid book, without a single thought or idea in it ... a sort of mental [[pabulum (disambiguation)|pabulum]]"). He also made it clear that he disliked Trollope's narrative method; Trollope's cheerful interpolations into his novels about how his storylines could take any twist their author wanted did not appeal to James's sense of artistic integrity. However, James thoroughly appreciated Trollope's attention to realistic detail, as he wrote in an essay shortly after the novelist's death:
<blockquote>His [Trollope's] great, his inestimable merit was a complete appreciation of the usual. ... [H]e ''felt'' all daily and immediate things as well as saw them; felt them in a simple, direct, salubrious way, with their sadness, their gladness, their charm, their comicality, all their obvious and measurable meanings. ... Trollope will remain one of the most trustworthy, though not one of the most eloquent, of the writers who have helped the heart of man to know itself. ... A race is fortunate when it has a good deal of the sort of imagination—of imaginative feeling—that had fallen to the share of Anthony Trollope; and in this possession our English race is not poor.<ref>James, Henry (1888). [https://archive.org/stream/partialportrait01jamegoog#page/n118/mode/2up "Anthony Trollope."] In ''Partial Portraits'', Macmillan and Co., pp. 100–01, 133.</ref></blockquote>

Writers such as [[William Thackeray]], [[George Eliot]] and [[Wilkie Collins]] admired and befriended Trollope, and Eliot noted that she could not have embarked on so ambitious a project as ''[[Middlemarch]]'' without the precedent set by Trollope in his own novels of the fictional—yet thoroughly alive—county of Barsetshire.<ref>Super, R. H. (1988), p. 412.</ref> Other contemporaries of Trollope praised his understanding of the quotidian world of institutions, official life, and daily business; he is one of the few novelists who find the office a creative environment.<ref>Sullivan, Ceri (2013). ''Literature in the Public Service: Sublime Bureaucracy'', Palgrave Macmillan, Ch. 3, pp. 65–99.</ref> [[W. H. Auden]] wrote of Trollope: "Of all novelists in any country, Trollope best understands the role of money. Compared with him, even [[Honoré de Balzac|Balzac]] is too romantic."<ref>Quoted in Wintle, Justin & Kenin, Richard, eds. (1978). [https://books.google.com/books?id=npE9AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA742 ''The Dictionary of Biographical Quotation''], p. 742. Routledge & Kegan Paul Ltd.</ref>

As trends in the world of the novel moved increasingly towards subjectivity and artistic experimentation, Trollope's standing with critics suffered. But [[Lord David Cecil]] noted in 1934 that "Trollope is still very much alive ... and among fastidious readers." He noted that Trollope was "conspicuously free from the most characteristic Victorian faults".<ref>[[Lord David Cecil]], ''Early Victorian Novelists – Essays in Revaluation'', p. 245</ref> In the 1940s, Trollopians made further attempts to resurrect his reputation; he enjoyed a critical renaissance in the 1960s, and again in the 1990s. Some critics today have a particular interest in Trollope's portrayal of women—he caused remark even in his own day for his deep insight and sensitivity to the inner conflicts caused by the position of women in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] society.<ref>"Anthony Trollope reveals an amazing insight into the love and the motive of woman. In this detail he has no equal in the whole catalogue of British male novelists until we go as far back as Richardson. Trollope has an amazing comprehension of the young lady. Meredith cannot approach the ground held by Trollope here." –  Harvey, Alexander (1917).
