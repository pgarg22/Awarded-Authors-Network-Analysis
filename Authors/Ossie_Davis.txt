==Early life==
Raiford Chatman Davis was born in [[Clinch County, Georgia|Cogdell, Georgia]], the son of Kince Charles Davis, a railway construction engineer, and his wife Laura (''née'' Cooper; July 9, 1898 – June 6, 2004).<ref>{{cite web| title=Ossie Davis Biography| url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/70/Ossie-Davis.html| work=filmreference| year=2008| access-date=2009-01-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nyjnews.com/obituary/obit.php3?id=1462746| archive-url=https://archive.today/20130130080525/http://www.nyjnews.com/obituary/obit.php3?id=1462746| url-status=dead| archive-date=January 30, 2013| title=Davis, Laura Cooper| newspaper=[[The Journal News]]| location=White Plains, New York| date=June 9, 2004}}</ref> He inadvertently became known as "Ossie" when his birth certificate was being filed and his mother's pronunciation of his name as "R.

His siblings included scientist [[William Conan Davis]], social worker Essie Morgan Davis, pharmacist Kenneth Curtis Davis, and biology teacher James Davis.<ref name="HistoryMakers">{{cite web|last=Davis|first=William C.|date=1 February 2013|title=The HistoryMakers® Video Oral History Interview with William Davis|url=http://www.thehistorymakers.org/sites/production/files/A2013_029_Davis_William_EAD.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171213015920/http://www.thehistorymakers.org/sites/production/files/A2013_029_Davis_William_EAD.pdf|archive-date=13 December 2017|access-date=|website=HistoryMakers.org}}</ref>

Following the wishes of his parents, he attended [[Howard University]] but dropped out in 1939 to fulfill his desire for an acting career in New York after a recommendation by [[Alain Locke]]; he later attended [[Columbia University School of General Studies]]. His acting career began in 1939 with the Rose McClendon Players in [[Harlem]].  During [[World War II]], Davis served in the [[United States Army]] in the Medical Corps.  He made his film debut in 1950 in the [[Sidney Poitier]] film ''[[No Way Out (1950 film)|No Way Out]]''.

==Career==
[[Image:Ossiedavis.jpg|thumb|upright|left|photo by [[Carl Van Vechten]], 1951]]
When Davis wanted to pursue a career in acting, he ran into the usual roadblocks that black people suffered at that time as they generally could only portray stereotypical characters such as [[Stepin Fetchit]]. Instead, he tried to follow the example of [[Sidney Poitier]] and play more distinguished characters. When he found it necessary to play a [[Pullman Company|Pullman]] [[sleeping car|porter]] or a butler, he played those characters realistically, not as a [[caricature]].

In addition to acting, Davis, along with [[Melvin Van Peebles]] and [[Gordon Parks]], was one of the notable black directors of his generation: he directed movies such as ''[[Gordon's War]]'', ''[[Black Girl (1972 film)|Black Girl]]'' and ''[[Cotton Comes to Harlem]]''. Along with [[Bill Cosby]] and Poitier, Davis was one of a handful of black actors able to find commercial success while avoiding stereotypical roles prior to 1970, which also included a significant role in the 1965 movie ''[[The Hill (film)|The Hill]]'' alongside [[Sean Connery]] plus roles in ''[[The Cardinal]]'' and ''[[The Scalphunters]]''. However, Davis never had the tremendous commercial or critical success that Cosby and Poitier enjoyed. As a [[playwright]], Davis wrote ''[[Paul Robeson]]: All-American'', which is frequently performed in [[theatre]] programs for young audiences.

In 1976, Davis appeared on [[Muhammad Ali]]'s novelty album for children, ''[[The Adventures of Ali and His Gang vs. Mr. Tooth Decay]]''.<ref name=RSJun16>{{cite news| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/remembering-muhammad-alis-trippy-anti-cavity-kids-record-20160606| title=Remembering Muhammad Ali's Trippy, Anti-Cavity Kids' Record| first=Jason| last=Heller| date=June 6, 2016| newspaper=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]| access-date=July 24, 2016}}</ref>

Davis found recognition late in his life by working in several of director [[Spike Lee]]'s films, including ''[[Do The Right Thing]]'', ''[[Jungle Fever]]'', ''[[She Hate Me]]'' and ''[[Get on the Bus]]''. He also found work as a commercial [[voice-over]] artist and served as the narrator of the early-1990s [[CBS]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Evening Shade]]'', starring [[Burt Reynolds]], where he also played one of the residents of a small southern town.

In 1999, Davis appeared as a theater caretaker in the [[Trans-Siberian Orchestra]] film ''[[The Ghosts of Christmas Eve]]'', which was released on DVD two years later.

For many years, he hosted the annual National Memorial Day Concert from Washington, DC.

He voiced [[Anansi]] the spider on the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] children's television series ''[[Sesame Street]]'' in its animation segments.

Davis's last role was a several episode guest role on the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] drama series ''[[The L Word]]'', as a father struggling with the acceptance of his daughter [[Bette Porter|Bette]] ([[Jennifer Beals]]) parenting a child with her lesbian partner. In his final episodes, his character was taken ill and died. His wife Ruby Dee was present during the filming of his own death scene. That episode, which aired shortly after Davis's own death, aired with a dedication to the actor.<ref>{{cite news| first1=Richard| last1=Severo| first2=Douglas| last2=Martin| url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40714FD3A5F0C768CDDAB0894DD404482#| title=Ossie Davis, Actor, Writer and Eloquent Champion of Racial Justice, Is Dead at 87| newspaper=[[The New York Times]]| date=5 February 2005| access-date=2007-02-06}}</ref> After Davis's passing, actor [[Dennis Haysbert]] portrayed him in the 2015 film ''[[Experimenter (film)|Experimenter]]''.

==Activism==
[[File:Opera star Stacey Robinson (left) with Ossie Davis in 1998.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Davis with activist and opera star Stacey Robinson (left) in 1998.]]
Davis and Dee were well known as [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] activists during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and were close friends of [[Malcolm X|Malcolm&nbsp;X]], [[Jesse Jackson]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and other icons of the era. They were involved in organizing the 1963 civil rights [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]], and served as its [[Master of Ceremonies|emcees]].

==Personal life==
[[File:Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee.jpg|thumb|upright|Davis and Dee]]
In 1948, Davis married actress [[Ruby Dee]], whom he had met on the set of [[Robert Ardrey]]'s 1946 play ''[[Jeb (play)|Jeb]]''. In their joint autobiography ''With Ossie and Ruby,'' they described their decision to have an [[open marriage]], later changing their minds.<ref>{{cite web | author=Sheri Stritof | author2=Bob Stritof | url=http://marriage.about.com/od/quotes/a/ossierubyopen.htm | title=Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee on Open Marriage | publisher=About.com | access-date=2007-01-11 | url-status=bot: unknown | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210143920/http://marriage.about.com/od/quotes/a/ossierubyopen.htm | archive-date=2007-02-10 }}</ref> In the mid-1960s they moved to the New York suburb of [[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle]], where they remained ever after.<ref>Greene, Donna.
