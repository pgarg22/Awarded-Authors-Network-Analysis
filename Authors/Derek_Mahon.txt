'''Derek Mahon''' (23 November 1941 – 1 October 2020) was an Irish poet. He was born in [[Belfast, Northern Ireland]] but lived in a number of cities around the world.  At his passing it was noted that his "influence in the Irish poetry community, literary world and society at large, and his legacy, is immense".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-54385928|title = Belfast-born poet Derek Mahon dies aged 78|work = BBC News|date = 2 October 2020}}</ref>  President of Ireland [[Michael D Higgins]] said of Mahon "he shared with his northern peers the capacity to link the classical and the contemporary but he brought also an edge that was unsparing of cruelty and wickedness."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-40058426.html|title='Yet another artist gone from us in recent times': Poet Derek Mahon dies aged 78|date=2 October 2020|first1=Steve|last1=Neville|first2=Mairéad|last2=Cleary|newspaper=[[Irish Examiner]]}}</ref>

==Biography==
Mahon was born the only child of Ulster Protestant working-class parents. His father and grandfather worked at [[Harland and Wolff]] while his mother worked at a local flax mill.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/02/books/derek-mahon-dead.html|title = Derek Mahon, Popular Irish Poet, is Dead at 78|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2 October 2020|last1 = Genzlinger|first1 = Neil}}</ref> During his childhood, he claims he was something of a solitary dreamer, comfortable with his own company yet aware of the world around him. Interested in literature from an early age, he attended Skegoneill Primary school and then the [[Royal Belfast Academical Institution]].

At [[Royal Belfast Academical Institution|Inst]] he encountered fellow students who shared his interest in literature and poetry. The school produced a magazine to which Mahon produced some of his early poems. According to the critic [[Hugh Haughton]] his early poems were highly fluent and extraordinary for a person so young. His parents could not see the point of poetry, but he set out to prove them wrong after he won his school's [[Forrest Reid]] Memorial Prize for the poem ‘The power that gives the water breath‘.<ref>[https://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/arid-20290644.html Life of poet is work in progress] ''Cork Examiner'' 11 October 2014. Retrieved 3 October 2020.</ref>

Mahon pursued third level studies at [[Trinity College, Dublin]] where he edited ''[[Icarus (magazine)|Icarus]]'', and formed many friendships with writers such as [[Michael Longley]], [[Eavan Boland]] and [[Brendan Kennelly]]. He started to mature as a poet. He left [[Trinity College Dublin|Trinity]] in 1965 to take up studies at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in Paris.

After leaving the Sorbonne in 1966 he worked his way through Canada and the United States. In 1968, while spending a year teaching English at [[Belfast High School]], he published his first collection of poems ''Night Crossing''. He later taught in a school in Dublin and worked in London as a freelance journalist. He  lived in Kinsale, Co. Cork. On 23 March 2007 he was awarded the [[David Cohen Prize]] for Literature. He won the [[Poetry Now Award]] in 2006 for his collection, ''Harbour Lights'', and again in 2009 for his ''Life on Earth'' collection.<ref>[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0328/1224243620224.html Mahon wins 'Irish Times' poetry prize for new collection] ''Irish Times'', 28 March 2009.</ref>

At times expressing anti-establishment values, Mahon has described himself as, an ‘aesthete’ with a penchant ‘for left-wingery […] to which, perhaps naively, I adhere.’<ref name="Left">{{cite web |title=Derek Mahon, A Poet of The Left |url=https://independentleft.ie/derek-mahon  |website=Independent Left |author=Ciarán O'Rourke |access-date=2019-12-18|date=2019-12-14}}</ref>

His papers are held at [[Emory University]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Derek Mahon papers, 1948–2018 |url=https://findingaids.library.emory.edu/documents/mahon689/ |website=Emory Archives |date=2 November 2007 |access-date=11 September 2020}}</ref>

In March 2020, at the beginning of the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the Republic of Ireland|COVID-19 pandemic]], [[RTÉ News]] ended its evening broadcast with Mahon reading his poem ''Everything Is Going to Be All Right''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/oct/02/derek-mahon-belfast-born-giant-of-irish-poetry-dies-aged-78|title=Derek Mahon, Belfast-born giant of Irish poetry, dies aged 78|first=Sian|last=Cain|date=2 October 2020|access-date=2 October 2020|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>

On 1 October 2020, Mahon died in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] after a short illness, aged 78.<ref name="itimes">{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/derek-mahon-one-of-ireland-s-leading-poets-has-died-aged-78-1.4370324|title=Derek Mahon, one of Ireland's leading poets, has died, aged 78|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|access-date=2 October 2020|first=Gerard|last=Smyth|url-access=subscription}}</ref>

He is survived by his partner Sarah Iremonger and his three children, Rory, Katy and Maisie.<ref name="itimes"/>

==Style==
Thoroughly educated and with a keen understanding of literary tradition, Mahon came out of the tumult of Northern Ireland with a formal, moderate, even restrained poetic voice. In an era of [[free verse]], Mahon has often written in [[Meter (poetry)|received forms]], using a broadly applied version of [[iambic pentameter]] that, metrically, resembles the "sprung foot" verse of [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]]. Some poems rhyme. Even the Irish landscape itself is never all that far from the classical tradition, as in his poem "Achill":
:[[Croagh Patrick]] towers like [[Naxos (island)|Naxos]] over the water
::And I think of my daughter at work on her difficult art
:And wish she were with me now between thrush and plover,
::Wild thyme and sea-thrift, to lift the weight from my heart.
He has also explored the genre of [[ekphrasis]]: the poetic reinterpretation of visual art. In that respect he has been interested in 17th century [[Culture of the Netherlands#Art|Dutch]] and [[Flanders|Flemish]] art.
