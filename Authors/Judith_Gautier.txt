She was married to [[Catulle Mendès]], but soon separated from him and had a brief affair with the composer [[Richard Wagner]] during the late summer of 1876. She collaborated with [[Pierre Loti]], the famous novelist, in writing a play, ''La fille du ciel'' (1912; English, "The Daughter of Heaven"), translated and produced under their personal supervision at [[Century Theatre (New York City)|The New Theatre]], [[New York City]].  She was an Oriental scholar and her works dealt mainly with Chinese and Japanese themes.<ref name=nie/> Her translations were among the earliest to bring Chinese and Japanese poetry to the attention of modern European poets.  She was a member of the [[Académie Goncourt]] (1910–17).
