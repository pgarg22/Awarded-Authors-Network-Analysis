Seaton wrote the libretto for the solo opera ''[[From the Diary of Sally Hemings]]'' (2001) for the composer [[William Bolcom]].<ref>Bolcom, William. "A Preface to ''From the Diary of Sally Hemings''", ''Michigan Quarterly Review'', XL.4. 611–12.</ref> The fictional work is a depiction of the innermost thoughts of [[Sally Hemings|Sarah "Sally" Hemings]], an enslaved woman of mixed race who is believed to have had a sexual relationship with [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Bolcom asked Seaton to create "diary" entries that would provide the text for his song cycle ''From The Diary of Sally Hemings''. Seaton spent more than a year doing research to create a "diary" that would be historically plausible. As David Lewman pointed out in an article on Seaton's libretto, "It was a challenge. Though there is voluminous material on Jefferson and his period, there are no surviving examples of writing by Sally Hemings."<ref>[http://www.las.illinois.edu/alumni/magazine/articles/2003/seaton/ ''LAS News''], 2003.
