'''Wilfrid Scawen Blunt''' (17 August 1840<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=MJQJPZuVv0om2Es9h%2FXa6Q&scan=1 |title=Index entry (birth) |access-date=6 May 2010 |work=FreeBMD |publisher=ONS}}</ref> – 10 September 1922<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=H42LpBVo%2BQ%2BFdHWBKTiDOw&scan=1 |title=Index entry (death) |access-date=6 May 2010 |work=FreeBMD |publisher=ONS}}</ref>), sometimes spelt '''Wilfred''', was an English poet and writer. He and his wife [[Lady Anne Blunt]] travelled in the Middle East and were instrumental in preserving the [[Arabian horse]] bloodlines through their farm, the [[Crabbet Arabian Stud]]. He was best known for his poetry, which appeared in a collected edition in 1914, and also wrote political essays and [[polemics]]. He became additionally known for strongly [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] views that were still uncommon in his time.

==Early life==
Blunt was the son of Francis Scawen Blunt, of Crabbet, by his wife Mary Chandler.<ref>William Smith Ellis [https://archive.org/details/parksandforests00elligoog/page/n95 <!-- pg=71 --> "The Parks and Forests of Sussex"], p. 71</ref> Blunt was born at [[Petworth House]] in Sussex, home of his aunt's husband [[George Wyndham, 1st Baron Leconfield|Baron Leconfield]]. He served in the [[Diplomatic Service]] 1858–1869. He was raised in the faith of his mother, a [[Catholicism|Catholic]] convert, and educated at [[Twyford School]], [[Stonyhurst College|Stonyhurst]], and at [[St Mary's College, Oscott]]. He was a cousin of [[Lord Alfred Douglas]].<ref name="Pearce2002">{{Cite book |author=Joseph Pearce |title=Old Thunder: A Life of Hilaire Belloc |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DrPQegJDCMcC&pg=PT189 |year=2002 |publisher=Ignatius Press |isbn=978-0-89870-942-1 |pages=189–}}</ref>

In 1869 Blunt married [[Lady Anne Blunt|Lady Anne Noel]], daughter of the [[Earl of Lovelace]] and [[Ada Lovelace]], and granddaughter of [[George Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=ok6CdznnTwC0iNNaSNEKRA&scan=1 |title=Index entry (marriage) |access-date=6 May 2010 |work=FreeBMD |publisher=ONS}}</ref> Together the Blunts travelled through Spain, Algeria, Egypt, the [[Syrian Desert]], and extensively in the Middle East and India. Based upon pure-blooded [[Arabian horse]]s they obtained in Egypt and the [[Nejd]], they co-founded [[Crabbet Arabian Stud]], and later bought a property near Cairo named [[Sheykh Obeyd]] to house their horse-breeding operation in Egypt.<ref name="ReferenceA">Wentworth, ''The Authentic Arabian Horse''</ref><!--ref for parts of para, page numbers needed-->

As an adult Blunt became an [[atheist]], though he underwent episodes of faith.<ref>"Wilfred Scawen Blunt was notorious as an atheist, a libertine, an adventurer and a poet. Somehow he found time to be a diplomat – one of the country's earliest to make a real attempt to understand Islam – and an anti-imperialist, becoming the first British-born person to be jailed for Irish independence."

In 1882, Blunt championed the cause of [[Ahmed 'Urabi|Urabi Pasha]], which led to him being barred from [[Egypt]] for four years.<ref>[[New International Encyclopedia]]</ref> Blunt was generally [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] as a matter of belief. His support for Irish independence led to imprisonment in 1888 for chairing an anti-eviction meeting in County Galway that had been banned by the Chief Secretary, [[Arthur Balfour]].<ref name=LRB>{{Cite web |title=In the saddle |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2012/09/21/alice-spawls/in-the-saddle/ |work=LRB blog |publisher=London Review of Books |access-date=21 September 2012 |author=Alice Spawls}}</ref> He was held in Galway Prison, then at [[Kilmainham Gaol]] in Dublin.<ref name=odnb>{{Cite book |title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Volume 6 |year=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=358}}Article by Elizabeth Longford.</ref>

Blunt's three attempts to enter [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] were unsuccessful. He stood as a "Tory Democrat" supporting Irish Home Rule at [[Camberwell North (UK Parliament constituency)|Camberwell North]] in [[1885 United Kingdom general election|1885]] and as a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] at [[Kidderminster (UK Parliament constituency)|Kiddermister]] in [[1886 United Kingdom general election|1886]], where he lost by 285 votes. While in prison in Ireland, he contested a [[Deptford (UK Parliament constituency)|Deptford by-election]] in 1888, but lost by 275 votes.<ref name=odnb/>

His most memorable line of poetry on the subject comes from ''Satan Absolved'' (1899), where the devil, answering a [[The White Man's Burden|Kiplingesque]] remark by God, snaps back: "The white man's burden, Lord, is the burden of his cash."<ref>[[Elizabeth Longford]], ''A Pilgrimage of Passion,'' Knopf, New York 1979 p.335, citing Blunt's ''Poetical Works,'' 2.254</ref> Here, [[Elizabeth Longford]] wrote, "Blunt stood [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s familiar concept on its head, arguing that the imperialists' burden is not their moral responsibility for the colonised peoples, but their urge to make money out of them."<ref>Elizabeth Longford, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31938 'Wilfred Scawen Blunt'] in [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], 2004.</ref>

Wilfrid and Lady Anne's only child to reach maturity was [[Judith Blunt-Lytton, 16th Baroness Wentworth]], later known as Lady Wentworth. As an adult, she was married in Cairo, but moved permanently to the Crabbet Park Estate in 1904.

Wilfrid had mistresses, including long-term relations with a courtesan, [[Catherine Walters|Catherine "Skittles" Walters]], and a Pre-Raphaelite beauty, [[Jane Morris]]. Eventually, he moved another mistress, Dorothy Carleton, into his home. This triggered Lady Anne's legal separation from him in 1906. At the time, Lady Anne signed a Deed of Partition drawn up by Wilfrid, under terms unfavourable to Lady Anne, whereby she kept the Crabbet Park property, where their daughter Judith lived, and half the horses, while Blunt took Caxtons Farm, also known as Newbuildings, and the rest of the stock. Always struggling with financial concerns and chemical dependency issues, Wilfrid sold off numerous horses to pay debts and constantly attempted to obtain additional assets. Lady Anne left the management of her properties to Judith and spent many months of each year in Egypt at the Sheykh Obeyd estate, moving there permanently in 1915.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><!--ref for parts of para, page numbers needed-->

Due primarily to Wilfrid's manœuvring to disinherit Judith and obtain the entire Crabbet property for himself, Judith and her mother were estranged at the time of Lady Anne's death in 1917. As a result, Lady Anne's share of the Crabbet Stud passed to Judith's daughters, under the oversight of an independent trustee. Blunt filed a lawsuit soon afterwards.<ref name=LRB/> Ownership of the Arabian horses went back and forth between the estates of father and daughter in subsequent years. Blunt sold more horses to pay off debts and shot at least four in an attempt to spite his daughter, an action which led to intervention of the trustee of the estate with a court injunction to prevent him from further "dissipating the assets" of the estate. The suit was settled in favour of the granddaughters in 1920 and Judith bought their share from the trustee, combining it with her own and reuniting the stud. Father and daughter briefly were reconciled shortly before Wilfrid Scawen Blunt's death in 1922, but his promise to rewrite his will to restore Judith's inheritance was not kept.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><!--ref for parts of para, page numbers needed-->

Blunt was a friend of [[Winston Churchill]], aiding him in a 1906 biography of his father, [[Lord Randolph Churchill]], Blunt having befriended years earlier in 1883 at a chess tournament.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Dockter |first=Warren |title=The Influence of a Poet: Wilfrid S.

==Work in Africa==
In the early 1880s, Britain was struggling with its Egyptian protectorate. Wilfrid Blunt was sent to notify [[Edward Malet|Sir Edward Malet]], the British agent, of Egyptian public opinion about the recent changes in government and development policies. In mid-December 1881, Blunt met with [[Ahmed 'Urabi]], known as Arabi or "El Wahid" (the Only One) due to his popularity with the Egyptians. 'Urabi was impressed with Blunt's enthusiasm and appreciation of [[Culture of Egypt|Egyptian culture]]. Their mutual respect created an environment in which 'Urabi could peacefully explain the reasoning behind his new nationalist movement, "Egypt for the Egyptians". Over the course of several days, Arabi explained the complicated background of the revolutionaries and their determination to rid themselves of the Ottoman oligarchy. Wilfrid Blunt was vital in the relay of this information to the British administration in Egypt, although this did not prevent tensions from flaring up into [[Anglo-Egyptian War|a conflict]] soon after.

Blunt remained vigorously opposed to colonial expansion in Africa, writing three books outlining his views: ''The Secret History of the English Occupation of Egypt...'' (1907), ''Gordon at Khartoum'' (1911), and ''My Diaries: Being a Personal Narrative of Events, 1888-1914'' (2 vols. 1919–1920). Historian Robert O. Collins wrote, The most vigorous English advocate of Egyptian nationalism, Blunt was both arrogant and irascible, his works scathing, discursive, and at times utterly ridiculous. Immature and unfair, both he and his writings must be used with caution, but even the dullest of men will come away stimulated if not aroused and with fresh insights to challenge the sometimes smug attitudes of British officials in Whitehall and Cairo. Of course, to them Blunt was anathema if not disloyal and Edward Mallet, the British Consul-General at Cairo from 1879 to 1883, replied to Blunt's charges in his posthumously published ''Egypt, 1879-1883'' (London, 1909).<ref>Robert O.

==Egyptian Garden scandal==
In 1901, a pack of foxhounds was shipped to Cairo to entertain the army officers. A fox hunt then took place in the desert near Cairo. The fox was chased into Blunt's garden, and the hounds and hunt followed it. As well as a house and garden, the land contained the Blunts' [[Sheykh Obeyd]] [[stud farm]], housing a number of valuable [[Arabian horse]]s. Blunt's staff challenged the trespassers – who, though army officers, were not in uniform – and beat them when they refused to turn back. For this, the staff were accused of assault against army officers and imprisoned. Blunt made strenuous efforts to free his staff, much to the embarrassment of the British army officers and civil servants involved.<ref>See papers relating to the scandal in "Wilfrid Blunt's Egyptian Garden: Fox hunting in Cairo, Uncovered Editions, The Stationery Office 1999.</ref>
