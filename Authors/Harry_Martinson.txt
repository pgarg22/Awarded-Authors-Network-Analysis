In 1929, he debuted as a poet. Together with [[Artur Lundkvist]], [[Gustav Sandgren]], [[Erik Asklund]] and [[Josef Kjellgren]] he authored the anthology ''[[Fem unga]]'' (Five Youths),<ref>{{cite news|last=Kumm|first=Björn|title=Obituary: Artur Lundkvist|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|location=London|page=13|date=12 December 1991|url =<!--| access-date = 4 January 2012-->}}</ref> which introduced [[Modernist Swedish literature|Swedish modernism]].

It has since been translated into more than thirty languages. The novel ''Vägen till Klockrike'' (''The Road to Klockrike'', 1948) was another huge success, and in 1949 Martinson became the first proletarian writer to be elected a member of the [[Swedish Academy]].<ref name="Bibliomonde" />

One of his most noted works is the poetic cycle ''[[Aniara]]'', which is a story of the spacecraft ''Aniara'' that during a [[spaceflight|journey through space]] loses its course and subsequently floats on without destination.

==Writing==
Harry Martinson debuted in 1929 with the collection of poems ''Spökskepp'' (''Ghost Ship''), that for the most part employed motifs of the ocean and life as a seaman. The same year he contributed to anthology ''[[Fem unga]]'', a ground-breaking and highly influential book in [[modernist literature|modernist]] Swedish literature. Martinson's major breakthrough was his 1931 poetry collection ''Nomad''. His poetry was noted for rich imagery with precise observations that emphazised details. In the books ''Resor utan mål'' (''Aimless journeys'', 1932) and ''Kap Farväl!'' (1933; English translation ''Cape Farewell'', 1934) Martinson recalled memories of his life as a seaman. In his later writing nature and the earth became increasingly important motifs. During the 1930s he developed a mastery in describing nature in both prose and poetry and was especially noted for his short nature poems with precise observations. In the [[autobiographical novel]]s ''Nässlorna blomma'' (''[[Flowering Nettle]]'', 1935) and ''Vägen ut'' (''The Way Out'', 1936) Martinson tells about his childhood. Martinson had a strong interest in [[science]] which was a prominent influence in his work. In his book ''Verklighet till döds'' (''Reality to Death'', 1940) written during World war II Martinson criticized contemporary social conditions and technological development. Criticism of modern culture is also a theme in Martinson's philosophical vagabond novel ''Vägen till Klockrike'' (1948; English translation ''The Road'', 1950) and the collection of poems ''Passad'' (1945).

In his later writing Martinson developed a new major theme based on his increasing interest in outer space and the cosmic. This came to most distinct expression in ''[[Aniara]]'' (1956), a poetic space epic that became Martinson's best known work. In his late work criticism of modern life and its technology came to an even stronger expression in his 1960 poetry collection ''Vagnen'' (''The Wagon''), which unlike his previous books was not well received by contemporary critics. Sensitive to criticism it appeared to be Martinson's last published collection of poems, but in 1971 he returned with ''Dikter om ljus och mörker'' (''Poems of Light and Darkness''). In 1974 Martinson was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] "for writings that catch the dewdrop and reflect the cosmos."<ref>Ulf Larsson [https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1974/martinson/article/  Harry Martinson: Catching the Dewdrop, Reflecting the Cosmos] nobelprize.org</ref>

== Death ==
The sensitive Martinson found it hard to cope with the criticism following his award, and committed suicide on 11{{nbsp}}February 1978 at the [[Karolinska University Hospital]] in Stockholm by cutting his stomach open with a pair of scissors in what has been described as a "[[Seppuku|hara-kiri]]-like manner".<ref name=AH>{{cite web|last1=Hansson|first1=Anita|title=Martinson begick harakiri|trans-title=Martinson committed hara-kiri|url=http://wwwc.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/0008/31/harakiri.html|website=wwwc.aftonbladet.se|date=31 August 2000|publisher=[[Aftonbladet]]|access-date=21 December 2015}}</ref><ref name="Minnen, bara minnen">{{cite book|first=Lars|last=Gyllensten|title=Minnen, bara minnen|trans-title=Memories, just memories|location=Stockholm|publisher=Albert Bonniers Förlag|date=2000|isbn=91-0-057140-7|language=sv|id={{LIBRIS|7150260}}}}</ref>
