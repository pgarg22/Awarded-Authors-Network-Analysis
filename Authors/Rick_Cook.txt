Cook was in the process of writing book 6 of this series (''The Wizardry Capitalized''), in spring 2000, when emergency heart surgery, and subsequent medication, interrupted him.<ref>[http://rickcooks.blogspot.com/2007/12/wiz-6-wizard-uncompleted.html "Wiz 6: The Wizard Uncompleted?"]</ref> The novel remains uncompleted, and Cook asked for input on his blog site as to whether or not he should publish the unfinished work as he felt that he would be unable to finish writing it. In February 2008 he announced that he has decided to present the unfinished work online.<ref>[http://rickcooks.blogspot.com/2008/02/wizardy-uncompleted-pt-ii.html "The Wizardy Uncompleted – Pt II"]</ref><ref>[https://sites.google.com/site/thewizardrycapitalized/Home "The Wizardy Capitalized"]</ref>
