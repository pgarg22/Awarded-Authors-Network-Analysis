'''Michael Austin Stackpole''' (born November 27, 1957)<ref name="myspace">{{cite web  | last = Stackpole  | first = Michael | title = Michael Stackpole's Myspace Page  |  publisher = Myspace | url = http://www.myspace.com/talionrevenant | access-date = 5 December 2008 }}</ref>  is an American [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] author best known for his ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[BattleTech]]'' books. He was born in [[Wausau, Wisconsin]], but raised in [[Vermont]]. He has a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in history from the [[University of Vermont]]. From 1977 on, he worked as a designer of [[role-playing game]]s for various gaming companies, and wrote dozens of magazine articles with limited distribution within the industry. He lives in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]].

==Game design career==
Michael Stackpole was hired full-time at [[Flying Buffalo]] after they accepted his submission for a solo ''[[Tunnels & Trolls]]'' adventure which was published in 1978 as ''[[City of Terrors]]''.<ref name="designers">{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers & Dragons|publisher=Mongoose Publishing|year=2011| isbn= 978-1-907702-58-7}}</ref>{{rp|36}} He wrote columns on industry news and reviews for Flying Buffalo's magazine ''Sorcerer's Apprentice''.<ref name="designers"/>{{rp|36}} Stackpole worked for [[Coleco]] from 1980-1981 as the result of a meeting between [[Rick Loomis]], Stackpole, and the president of Coleco at a gaming and pinball convention.<ref name="designers"/>{{rp|36}} Stackpole designed the roleplaying game ''[[Mercenaries, Spies and Private Eyes]]'', which Flying Buffalo published in 1983.<ref name="designers"/>{{rp|38}} Stackpole left Flying Buffalo after the company's 1985 move to [[Scottsdale, Arizona]].<ref name="designers"/>{{rp|39}} Stackpole, [[Ken St. Andre]], and [[Liz Danforth]] designed the computer roleplaying game ''[[Wasteland (video game)|Wasteland]]'', published by [[Interplay Entertainment|Interplay]] in 1988.<ref name="designers"/>{{rp|39}} He later returned to work with his fellow creators of Wasteland as a writer on its sequel ''[[Wasteland 2]]'', released in 2014 by [[inXile Entertainment]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Wasteland 2|work=[[Internet Movie Database]]|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2321641/fullcredits}}</ref>

In response to the accusations of [[Patricia Pulling]] (among others) who felt that the "[[occult]]" elements of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' were driving people to suicide, Stackpole began to defend the game and the roleplaying game community.<ref name="designers"/>{{rp|22}} Stackpole published one of his first articles about the media misinformation in ''Sorcerer's Apprentice'' #14 (Spring 1982) in an article called "Devil Games? Nonsense!",<ref name="designers"/>{{rp|38}} and even debated the Western Regional Director of Pulling's BADD organization on the radio on July 14, 1987.<ref name="designers"/>{{rp|22}} He compared BADD's statistics of suicides among roleplayers to the general rate of teen suicide and found the number of roleplayers committing suicide was actually lower than those who were not gamers, and published his argument in an article called "The Truth about Role-Playing Games" in the 1989 book ''Satanism in America''; he also published the document "The Pulling Report" in 1990, which further discredited Pulling's stand against roleplaying games.<ref name="designers"/>{{rp|22}}

In the 1980s, Stackpole began designing computer games for [[Coleco]] and then [[Interplay Productions]].  His work at Interplay included ''[[Bard's Tale III]]'', ''[[Wasteland (video game)|Wasteland]]'', ''[[Neuromancer (video game)|Neuromancer]]'', ''[[Star Trek: 25th Anniversary (computer game)|Star Trek: 25th Anniversary]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Judgment Rites]]''.  He also created the role-playing game ''[[Mercenaries, Spies and Private Eyes]]'', which provided the game mechanics for ''Wasteland'', and wrote several [[gamebook|solo adventures]] for the [[Tunnels & Trolls]] role-playing system, including "[[Dargon's Dungeon]]", "[[Overkill (Flying Buffalo)|Overkill]]", "[[City of Terrors]]" and "[[Sewers of Oblivion]]".

Stackpole loaned his image to [[Decipher, Inc.|Decipher]] for the image of Corran Horn used in their ''[[Star Wars Customizable Card Game]]'' expansion "Reflections 2".  [[Timothy Zahn]] did likewise for the character [[Talon Karrde]]. Stackpole teamed up with Decipher again, helping them write the background story to their ''[[WARS TCG]]'', including [[e-books]] and other writing tie-ins for the [[expanded universe]].

In January, 2019 Stackpole resigned from the Board of Directors of GAMA (Game Manufacturer's Association), citing its inactivity and the poor handling of an incident involving GAMA President Stephen Brissaud.<ref>[https://techraptor.net/content/michael-stackpole-resigns-gama '''Tech Raptor''' - ''Michael A. Stackpole Resigns from GAMA, Slams Board of Directors'']</ref> He was one of the few remaining Emeritus Directors (alongside [[Rick Loomis]] and Will Niebling).

==Writing career==
[[File:Micheal A Stackpole at Dragon Con 2007.jpg|right|thumb|Michael A. Stackpole at [[Dragon Con]] 2007]]
In 1986 Stackpole wrote his first novel, the fantasy story ''Talion: Revenant''.  His editors believed that a 175,000 word book was too long for an unknown author and that the story wasn't particularly engaging. The story remained unpublished for the next 11 years until reworked by Stackpole's editor, Anne Lesley Groell. Stackpole clarifies these issues himself in the afterword of the published version of ''Talion.'' The manuscript was published in 1997 by Bantam Books.

Stackpole's first published novels were the Warrior trilogy for the ''[[BattleTech]]'' universe, published by [[FASA]] in 1988-1989.<ref name="designers"/>{{rp|122}} His "Blood of Kerensky" trilogy (1989-1991) were the last novels published directly by FASA; the ''[[BattleTech: The Animated Series|BattleTech]]'' cartoon (1994) was set during the events of this trilogy.<ref name="designers"/>{{rp|124}} Stackpole also wrote a trilogy of novels published in 1992, which were based on the ''[[Dark Conspiracy]]'' roleplaying game by [[Game Designers' Workshop|GDW]].<ref name="designers"/>{{rp|60}}

Stackpole has found his greatest success in serial works that continue the characters and plot lines developed by other authors.  In 1987 he began writing novels set in the BattleTech universe for [[FASA Corporation]], some of which were used as the source for a television animated series. He was then selected to write several novels in the Star Wars universe for [[Bantam Books]]. He also wrote several comics based in the Star Wars universe for [[Dark Horse Comics]]. Initially these covered the period just before his ''X-Wing'' novels. Later, he also covered the marriage of [[Luke Skywalker]] and [[Mara Jade]] in the graphic novel ''[[Union (Star Wars)|Union]]'' and collaborated with [[Timothy Zahn]] on Mara Jade's early career. In the foreword to his book ''[[Outbound Flight]]'', Timothy Zahn thanks Stackpole and issues a challenge at ''Star Wars [[Trivial Pursuit]]''.

In addition, he has written several novels and short stories with original settings. One series is the ''DragonCrown War Cycle''. These books attempted to break fantasy conventions in order to stir reader interest, including the introduction of firearms in a fantasy setting.  Reception of these books was fairly positive based on Amazon reviews, but reviews elsewhere were not as good.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Beth|title=The DragonCrown War Cycle: Fanboy fantasy at its very worst|url=http://www.fantasyliterature.com/reviews/the-dragoncrown-war-cycle/|website=FantasyLiterature.com}}</ref>

Stackpole contributed one of the four stories in [[Roger Zelazny]]'s [[shared world]] anthology ''Forever After'', published by [[Baen Books]] in 1995. He was a contributor in the 1998 anthology ''[[Lord of the Fantastic]]'' commemorating Zelazny.

''The Age of Discovery'' trilogy is his latest complete series, with ''A New World'' released mid-2007. The trilogy is set in a fantasy world, with an attempt at an unconventional approach to magic and mastery.

''The Crown Colonies'' is a trilogy that re-imagines the events of the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The first book, ''At The Queen's Command'', was released in November 2010.

At New York Comic Con 2012, it was revealed that Blizzard Entertainment had approached Stackpole to write the next novel in their series based on the popular MMORPG, ''World of Warcraft''. The novel, titled ''Volâ€™jin: Shadows of the Horde'', centres around the chieftain of the Darkspear Trolls as his loyalty to the Horde is put to the ultimate test after an assassination attempt on his life. The novel was released in July 2013.

==''The Secrets''==

===Newsletter===
Stackpole also writes and publishes an [[online]] [[newsletter]] titled ''The Secrets'', which offers tips, tricks, and tidbits about  fiction writing (focusing on, but not limited to, science fiction and fantasy). It is aimed towards the serious fan fiction writer and some casual writers, and includes information about getting books published..

Topics discussed in the newsletter range from how to beat [[writer's block]] to how to [[constructed world|build a world]], and even how to manage writing as a career.

''The Secrets'' newsletter requires a subscription, and issues are released every two weeks.

===Podcast===
''The Secrets'' Newsletter has an "audio companion" in The Secrets [[Podcast]]. The first ten podcasts were based on material from the first ten issues of The Secrets newsletter. After the first series ended, the content of the podcast diverged from the newsletter. The podcasts average twenty-five minutes long and are voiced and produced by Stackpole.

The podcasts are free and require no subscription, but older episodes have been retired and are no longer available on the main archive.

Stackpole is also one of the main hosts on ''The Dragon Page Cover to Cover'', a book review and interview show dealing mainly with [[fantasy]] and [[science fiction|sci fi]] publications, together with [[Michael R. Mennenga]].

==Skepticism==
Stackpole has been the executive director of the Phoenix Skeptics since 1988 and is listed as the contact for the group in the magazine ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]''.
