== Career ==
During the late 1980s and the 1990s, Funke established herself as writer of [[Children's literature|children's fiction]] in Germany. Her early work includes two children's series—the fantasy-oriented ''Gespensterjäger'' (Ghosthunters) and the ''Wilde Hühner'' (''C.H.I.X.'') line of books.<ref name=":0" /> Funke's initial success was relegated to her native Germany, but once her novels began being translated into English in 2002, she achieved wider recognition.<ref name=":0" /> [[Barry Cunningham (publisher)|Barry Cunningham]], a publisher who was well-known for signing [[J.

Funke's first book to be translated into English was ''[[The Thief Lord]]'', originally published in 2000 as ''Herr der Diebe''. The translation, released by The Chicken House in 2002, won widespread acclaim and reached several best-seller lists.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Cornelia Funke|url=https://kids.scholastic.com/kids/author/cornelia-funke/|access-date=2020-11-30|website=kids.scholastic.com}}</ref> It was later adapted into a [[The Thief Lord (film)|feature film of the same name]] in 2006.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2008-12-28|title=The Thief Lord - Movie Review|url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-thief-lord|access-date=2020-11-30|website=www.commonsensemedia.org|language=en}}</ref>

Another early English translation was ''[[Dragon Rider (novel)|Dragon Rider]]'', originally published in Germany in 1997 as ''Drachenreiter''. Released in the United States in 2004, it became a massive success,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Welle (www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche|title=Cornelia Funke – A fabulous storyteller {{!}} DW {{!}} 30.05.2020|url=https://www.dw.com/en/cornelia-funke-a-fabulous-storyteller/av-52220086|access-date=2020-11-30|website=DW.COM|language=en-GB}}</ref> and remained on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]] for 78 weeks,<ref name="magazined">{{cite web|title=Deutschland.de|url=http://www.magazine-deutschland.de/issue/PhantasieFunke_5-06_ENG_E1.php|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212143315/http://www.magazine-deutschland.de/issue/PhantasieFunke_5-06_ENG_E1.php|archive-date=12 December 2007|access-date=8 November 2015}}</ref> reaching number one on the Children's Best-Seller list.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|last=Garner|first=Dwight|date=2005-01-16|title=Inside the List (Published 2005)|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/16/books/review/inside-the-list.html|access-date=2020-11-30|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> A sequel, ''Dragon Rider: The Griffin's Feather'', was published over a decade later, in 2017,<ref>{{cite web|author=Jazz|date=24 February 2017|title=Dragon rider is getting a sequel!|url=https://www.chickenhousebooks.com/blog/dragon-rider-is-getting-a-sequel/|access-date=2 November 2017|website=Chicken House}}</ref> and a [[Dragon Rider (film)|feature film adaptation of the same name]] was released in 2020.<ref>{{cite web|date=1 October 2020|title=Drachenreiter (2020)|url=https://www.kino-zeit.de/film-kritiken-trailer-streaming/drachenreiter-2020|access-date=13 October 2020|work=kino-zeit.de}}</ref> 

Funke found further acclaim ''[[Inkheart]]'' (2003), which won the 2004 [[Indies Choice Book Awards|BookSense Book of the Year Award for Children's Literature]].<ref name="bsby">[http://www.bookweb.org/btw/awards/BSBY.html BookSense Book of the Year Children's Literature] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224044912/http://www.bookweb.org/btw/awards/BSBY.html|date=December 24, 2007}}</ref> ''Inkheart'' was the first part of a [[Inkheart trilogy|trilogy]] and was continued with ''[[Inkspell]]'' (2005), which won Funke her second BookSense Book of the Year Award for Children's Literature in 2006. The trilogy was initially concluded in ''[[Inkdeath]]'', but has been revived in 2020 when Funke announced that a sequel called ''Die Farbe der Rache'' (''The Color of Revenge'') will be published by October 2021 in Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Cornelia Funke – Die offizielle Homepage|url=https://corneliafunke.com/de/news/|access-date=2020-11-30|website=corneliafunke.com}}</ref>

Following the release of the first ''Inkheart'' novel, [[New Line Cinema]] bought the film rights to all three books for a cinema adaptation. Funke moved to Los Angeles in 2005 after she had accepted the offer to participate as the film's producer alongside [[Barry Mendel]].<ref name="one2">[http://www.slashfilm.com/2008/01/03/release-date-changes-be-kind-rewind-27-dresses-inkheart/ "Release Date Changes: Be Kind Rewind, 27 Dresses, Inkheart"]</ref> Principal photography on the [[Inkheart (film)|''Inkheart'' film]] began in 2006.<ref name="two2">[https://corneliafunke.com/de/news/grosse-ueberraschung-fuer-alle-tintenwelt-fans "Große Überraschung für Tintenwelf-Fans"]</ref> Directed by [[Iain Softley]], the film is based on a screenplay by [[David Lindsay-Abaire]] and features an [[ensemble cast]] that includes [[Brendan Fraser]], [[Helen Mirren]], [[Paul Bettany]], [[Jim Broadbent]], [[Rafi Gavron]], [[Andy Serkis]] and newcomer [[Eliza Bennett]], among others.<ref name="two2" /> Upon release, the film received mixed reviews.<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|inkheart|title=Inkheart}}</ref> In 2009, a video game based on the film was released for the [[Nintendo DS]].<ref name="gamefaqs">{{cite web|date=January 12, 2009|title=Inkheart Release Information for DS|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/ds/data/954949.html|access-date=August 7, 2011|publisher=GameFAQs}}</ref>

In 2010, Cornelia returned with her first book since ''Inkdeath'' in 2007, ''[[Reckless (Cornelia Funke novel)|Reckless]]''. The combined printing run for the first hardcover edition was 1,000,000 copies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-book-news/article/42483-a-reckless-reveal.html|title = A 'Reckless' Reveal}}</ref> Two sequels, ''Fearless'' and ''The Golden Yarn'', were released in 2013 and 2016.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}} 

In 2015, the film ''[[Ghosthunters on Icy Trails]]'' (German original title: ''Gespensterjäger''), based on her novel ''Ghosthunters and the Incredibly Revolting Ghost!'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ghosthunters_on_icy_trails/|title=Ghosthunters: On Icy Trails (Gespensterjäger)|access-date=24 June 2018}}</ref> was released in Germany on 2 April 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fbw-filmbewertung.com/film/gespensterjaeger_auf_eisiger_spur|title=Gespensterjäger - Auf eisiger Spur|website=Deutsche Filmbewertung und Medienbewertung FBW|access-date=24 June 2018}}</ref>

In 2017, Funke published ''The Book No One Ever Read'', the first work written by the author in English, as opposed to being written in German first.<ref name="auto">{{Cite news|url=https://www.abendblatt.de/kultur-live/buecher/article213187313/Cornelia-Funke-und-ein-Buch-das-niemand-las.html|title=Cornelia Funke und ein Buch, das niemand las|last=dpa|access-date=2018-02-17|language=de-DE}}</ref> Funke calls the picture book her "''Inkheart'' for kindergartners" and also illustrated the book herself.<ref>{{Citation|last=FM|first=Player|title=All About Cornelia Funke|url=https://player.fm/series/bay-area-book-festival-podcast/all-about-cornelia-funke|language=en|access-date=2018-02-17}}</ref>

==On writing==
On her personal website, Funke states that the vital starting point for a good book is an "idea".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corneliafunke.de/en/questions/question-86.html|title=Cornelia Funke – The Official Website|website=www.corneliafunke.de|access-date=24 June 2018}}</ref> She said of ideas that "they come from everywhere and nowhere, from outside and inside. I have so many, I won't be able to write them down in one lifetime."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corneliafunke.de/en/questions/question-42.html|title=Cornelia Funke – The Official Website|website=www.corneliafunke.de|access-date=24 June 2018}}</ref> The characters, Funke elaborates, "Mostly they step into my writing room and are so much alive, that I ask myself, where did they come from. Of course, some of them are the result of hard thinking, adding characteristics, manners, etc., but others are alive from the first moment they appear", and pointed out that Dustfinger from ''Inkheart'' was one of the most vivid characters who ever popped into her mind.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corneliafunke.de/en/questions/question-82.html|title=Cornelia Funke – The Official Website|website=www.corneliafunke.de|access-date=24 June 2018}}</ref> For aspiring authors, Funke says: "Read&nbsp;– and be curious. And if somebody says to you: 'Things are this way. You can't change it' – don't believe a word."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corneliafunke.de/en/questions/question-61.html|title=Cornelia Funke – The Official Website|website=www.corneliafunke.de|access-date=24 June 2018}}</ref>

Her early time as a social worker has inspired the way in which she deals with the themes in her literature. In ''The Thief Lord'', she shows children being in a difficult situation, but also still being children. Scipio says once that he is a good thief because he is small. She is willing to celebrate children for their own strengths, not just their ability to act like adults. In her picture book, ''The Book No One Ever Read'', Funke starts: "Every book longs to tell its story."<ref name="auto" />

==Personal life==
Funke married printer Rolf Frahm in 1979. Their daughter, Anna, was born in 1989 and soon after their son, Ben, was born in 1994.<ref name=fembio/> The family lived in Hamburg for 24 years,<ref name=fembio/> until they moved to Los Angeles in May 2005.<ref>
