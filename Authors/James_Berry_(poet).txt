==Biography==
The son of Robert Berry, a [[smallholding|smallholder]], and his wife Maud, a seamstress, James Berry was born and grew up in rural [[Portland Parish|Portland]], [[Jamaica]].<ref name="guardian" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lowe|first=Hannah|last2=Barrs|first2=Myra|date=2015-01-02|title=James Berry at Ninety|journal=Wasafiri|volume=30|issue=1|pages=5–10|doi=10.1080/02690055.2015.980994|issn=0269-0055}}</ref> He began writing stories and poems while still at school.<ref name=Channel4 /> During the [[Second World War]], as a teenager, he went to work for six years (1942–48) in the United States, before returning to Jamaica. 
In his own words:
:"America had run into a shortage of farm labourers and was recruiting workers from Jamaica. I was 18 at the time. My friends and I, all anxious for improvement and change, were snapped up for this war work and we felt this to be a tremendous prospect for us. But we soon realised, as we had been warned, that there was a colour problem in the United States that we were not familiar with in the Caribbean. America was not a free place for black people. When I came back from America, pretty soon the same old desperation of being stuck began to affect me. When the ''[[Empire Windrush|Windrush]]'' came along, it was godsend, but I wasn't able to get on the boat.... I had to wait for the second ship to make the journey that year, the [[SS Orbita|SS ''Orbita'']]."<ref>Ian Thomas, [http://www.blackhistorymonth.org.uk/article/section/poets-corner/the-poet-james-berry/ "The Poet James Berry"], ''Black History Month 365'', 19 August 2015.</ref>

Settling in 1948 in Great Britain, he attended night school, trained and worked as a telegrapher in London, while also writing.<ref name=Gale>Elizabeth Shostak, [http://www.answers.com/topic/james-berry-1 "James Berry"], Gale Contemporary Black Biography.</ref> He has been reported as saying: "I knew I was right for London and London was right for me. London had books and accessible libraries."<ref>Interview quoted in [[Onyekachi Wambu]], [https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/modern/literature_01.shtml Black British Literature since Windrush], BBC History.</ref>

He became an early member of the [[Caribbean Artists Movement]], founded in 1966 by [[Edward Kamau Brathwaite]], [[Andrew Salkey]] and [[John La Rose]],<ref name=BL /><ref>[http://www.georgepadmoreinstitute.org/archive/collection/caribbean-artists-movement "Caribbean Artists Movement"], George Padmore Institute Archive Catalogue.</ref> and in 1971 was its acting chair.<ref name="guardian" /> In 1976 Berry compiled the anthology ''Bluefoot Traveller'' and in 1979 his first poetry collection, ''Fractured Circles'', was published by [[New Beacon Books]]. In 1981 he won the [[Poetry Society]]'s [[National Poetry Competition]], the first poet of West Indian origin to do so.<ref name="Oxford Companion">[[David Dabydeen]], John Gilmore, Cecily Jones (eds), ''The Oxford Companion to Black British History'', Oxford University Press, 2007, ''"News for Babylon"'', p. 343.</ref> He edited the landmark anthology ''News for Babylon'' (1984), considered "a ground-breaking publication because its publishing house [[Chatto & Windus]] was 'mainstream' and distinguished for its international poetry list".<ref name="Oxford Companion" />

Berry wrote  many books for young readers, including ''A Thief in the Village and Other Stories'' (1987), ''The Girls and Yanga Marshall'' (1987), ''The Future-Telling Lady and Other Stories'' (1991), ''Anancy-Spiderman'' (1988), ''Don't Leave an Elephant to Go and Chase a Bird'' (1996) and ''First Palm Trees'' (1997).
