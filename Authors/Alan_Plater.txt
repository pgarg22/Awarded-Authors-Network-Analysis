==Career==
Plater was born in [[Jarrow]], County Durham, although his family moved to [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] in 1938. 
He attended [[Kingston High School, Hull|Kingston High School]].<ref name="Coveney">{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/jun/25/alan-plater-obituary|title=Alan Plater obituary | work=The Guardian|first=Michael|last=Coveney|access-date=3 July 2010 | location=London | date=25 June 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100630111709/http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2010/jun/25/alan-plater-obituary| archive-date= 30 June 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>

Jarrow was much publicised as a severely economically depressed area before the Second World War (Plater joked that his family left Jarrow just after the [[Great Depression]] to catch Hull just before [[Hull Blitz|the Blitz]]).  He trained as an architect at [[Newcastle University|King's College, Newcastle]] (later the [[Newcastle University School of Architecture, Planning and Landscape]]), but only practised in the profession briefly, at a junior level.<ref name="Telegraph"/> He later stated that it was shortly after he was forced to fend off a herd of pigs from eating his tape measure while he was surveying a field that he left to pursue writing full-time. Plater stayed in the north of England for many years after he became prominent as a writer and lived in Hull.<ref name="Telegraph">{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/7854251/Z-Cars-writer-Alan-Plater-dies-after-cancer-battle.html|title=Z-Cars writer Alan Plater dies after cancer battle – Telegraph|work=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=30 June 2010 | location=London | date=25 June 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100628023709/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/7854251/Z-Cars-writer-Alan-Plater-dies-after-cancer-battle.html| archive-date= 28 June 2010 | url-status= dead}}</ref>

He first made his mark as a scriptwriter for ''[[Z-Cars]]'' (1962–65), along with its spin-offs ''[[Softly, Softly (TV series)|Softly, Softly]]'' (1966–69) and ''[[Softly, Softly: Task Force]]'' (1969–76). His subsequent credits include ''The Reluctant Juggler'' in the series ''The Edwardians'' (1972), ''[[Shoulder to Shoulder]]'' (1974), ''[[The Stars Look Down (TV serial)|The Stars Look Down]]'' (1975), ''[[Trinity Tales]]'' (1975), ''[[Oh No It's Selwyn Froggitt]]'', ''The Journal of Vasilije Bogdanovic'', the musical ''Close the Coalhouse Door'' with songwriter [[Alex Glasgow]] from the writings of [[Sid Chaplin]], ''[[Get Lost!]]'' (1981), ''[[On Your Way, Riley]]'' (1982), ''[[Fortunes of War (TV series)|Fortunes of War]]'' (1987) an adaptation based on the novels of [[Olivia Manning]], ''[[The Beiderbecke Trilogy]]'' (1985–1988), ''[[Misterioso (play)|Misterioso]]'' (an adaptation of his novel, 1991), ''[[Oliver's Travels]]'' (1995), an adaptation of [[J.B. Priestley]]'s ''[[The Good Companions]]'' (1980) for [[Yorkshire Television]], a film adaptation of [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Keep the Aspidistra Flying]]'', ''[[Belonging (TV series)|Belonging]]'' and the theatre play ''Peggy for You'', based on the life of Plater's former agent [[Peggy Ramsay]], which was nominated in 2001 for a [[Laurence Olivier]] Theatre Award.<ref name="Telegraph"/>

He also contributed to the [[BBC]] series ''[[Dalziel and Pascoe (BBC TV series)|Dalziel and Pascoe]]'', and adapted [[Chris Mullin (politician)|Chris Mullin]]'s novel ''[[A Very British Coup (mini-series)|A Very British Coup]]'' (1988) for television. He was the driving force<ref name="Telegraph"/> behind the TV version of ''[[Flambards (TV series)|Flambards]]'', which under his influence was claimed to be slanted well to the political left of [[K. M. Peyton]]'s [[Flambards|original books]]. Jazz is a recurring motif through much of Plater's work, often referenced explicitly as well as underpinning his story structures.<ref name="screenonline">{{Cite web|url= http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/473028/index.html|title=screenonline: Plater, Alan (1935–2010) Biography|work=screenonline.org.uk|first=Lez|last=Cooke|access-date=30 June 2010}}</ref> Among his few feature films he collaborated twice with [[Christopher Miles]] on two successful [[D.H.Lawrence]] projects ''[[The Virgin and the Gypsy (film)|The Virgin and the Gypsy]]'' and ''[[Priest of Love]]''.<ref>DVD – 'Virgin and the Gypsy' Arrow Classics FCD 434 –  "An audience with Honor Blackman and Christopher Miles" – released 2010</ref><ref>Butler, Ivan.

He was a supporter of [[Hull City A.F.C.]]. His play ''Confessions of a City Supporter'' on his lifelong relationship with the club was staged during the first-ever run of performances at the new home of the [[Hull Truck Theatre|Hull Truck Theatre Company]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hull.co.uk/news.asp?pageid=74&MediaCategoryId=3&NewsID=949&MediaType=news|title=Hull Forward – News & Events|work=hull.co.uk|access-date=30 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004080600/http://www.hull.co.uk/news.asp?pageid=74&MediaCategoryId=3&NewsID=949&MediaType=news|archive-date=4 October 2011|url-status=dead}} But before that, he had been behind the launch of the independent Hull Arts Centre in 1972, for whom he had written the play 'Tigers Are Coming' ('Tigers' is the nickname for Hull AFC).

==Plater on his own work==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2020}}
In an interview with [[Richard Whiteley]], Plater claimed he had never intended to write sensational plot-driven sagas with outlandish characters and that he had never intended to make the sort of "rubbish programmes featuring high-speed car crashes of which there are too many on television". Plater said that he had always tried to make his characters normal people, whose normal lives are interrupted when the outside world comes into their lives.

Plater claimed his two best-known characters, Trevor Chaplin and Jill Swinburne in the ''Beiderbecke'' series, were based on himself. Trevor represented his personal interests, jazz, football and snooker (the parallel of someone from the northeast in Yorkshire also fitted) while Jill represented his political beliefs such as conservationism, environmentalism and socialism. The couple were based on his earlier characters of Neville Keaton and Judy Threadgold in ''Get Lost!'' (1981).

==Personal life and honours==
Plater was married to Shirley Johnston (1958–85), with whom he had two sons and a daughter,<ref name="Hayward">{{cite news

Plater was president of the [[Writers' Guild of Great Britain]] from September 1991 until April 1995. He received honorary degrees from the [[University of Hull]] and [[Northumbria University]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]. In the New Year's Honours List published 31 December 2004, he was created a [[Order of the British Empire|Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] for services to drama. He is commemorated with a green plaque on [[The Avenues, Kingston upon Hull]].

==Death==
Plater died of cancer at a London hospice at the age of 75. His death was announced on 25 June 2010.<ref name="bbcdeath"/>
