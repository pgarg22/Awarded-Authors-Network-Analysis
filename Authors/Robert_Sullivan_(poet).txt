His wide-ranging work explores dimensions of Māori tradition as well as "contemporary urban experiences, including local racial and social concerns."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bookcouncil.org.nz/Writers/Profiles/Sullivan,%20Robert |title=New Zealand Book Council |publisher=Bookcouncil.org.nz |date= |accessdate=3 October 2012}}</ref> His writing has a post modern feel and shows acute awareness of important [[Aotearoa]]/New Zealand issues while linking them in a complex way back to the cultural past.<ref>JENSEN, K. „Sullivan, Robert.“ The Oxford Companion to New Zealand Literature. R. Robinson & N.
Wattie (Hg.). Melbourne: Oxford UP, 1998, 519.</ref> In the poetic narrative ''Star Waka'' (1999), for example, Sullivan employs traditional Māori story-telling techniques ([[oral tradition]]) in order to link contemporary and traditional topics from Aotearoa/New Zealand with concepts and ideas from a European background. This approach allows him to study the identity relation between Māori and [[New Zealand European|Pākehā]] within [[Transculturalism|transcultural]] themes of voyaging, personal and national, of the poet and of Māori. In a sense, the poems in ''Star Waka'' "themselves function like a waka."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.press.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/home/browse-books/notices/notices/template/notice_item.jsp?cid=479034 |title=Star Waka - Auckland University Press - The University of Auckland |publisher=Press.auckland.ac.nz |date= |accessdate=3 October 2012}}</ref> ''Star Waka'' was "lauded for its poetic flair".<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

He is "widely seen as one of the most important contemporary Māori poets".<ref>"SULLIVAN, R.“ Cambridge Guide to Literature in English. D. HEAD (Hg.). Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2006, 1078.</ref>

==Critical reception==
Sullivan's ''Shout Ha! to the Sky'' (2010) was described by [[Paula Green (poet)|Paula Green]] in the ''New Zealand Herald'' as "a stunning symphony of love, politics, tenderness, confession, sharpness and insight", which "should be in every school library and accompany the journey of any reader drawn to the history and politics of where we come from and who we are".<ref name="Green">{{cite news |last1=Green |first1=Paula |title=Poetry Reviews: Fossicking in the past |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/poetry-reviews-fossicking-in-the-past/EO4XMIPIMK3YWFJTYFB4LM2ZYU/ |access-date=23 February 2021 |work=New Zealand Herald |date=7 March 2011}}</ref> She described his collection ''Cassino'' (2010), which paid tribute to those who died and fought at the [[Battle of Monte Cassino]] during World War II, as again highlighting his "wide-ranging voice" and being "sumptuous in content yet simple in execution".<ref name="Green"/>
