===Playwright===
His first play, ''Seven Days of Mourning'' (adapted from his novel published by Random House), was staged on [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] at [[Circle in the Square Theatre|Circle in the Square]]. [[Clive Barnes]] called it "spiky, yet intensely moving. A ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'' without music, but with blood. Unique, wild, funny. It still haunts me."{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

Simckes wrote the off-off-Broadway play ''Ten Best Martyrs of the Year'', a [[Theater for the New City]] (TNC) production directed by Crystal Field, about the ten rabbis who were tortured to death in [[Rome]] for supporting the revolt led by [[Simon bar Kokhba|Bar Kokhbah]] in 2nd century [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. Simckes said of that play, "I tend to make tragic comment in a mixture of styles. So what did I do? I wrote a play as if through the eyes of [[Hadrian]], the Roman emperor, watching the genocide of the [[Jews]] from his balcony."<ref name="tallmer">Tallmer, Jerry, [http://www.thevillager.com/villager_52/nossigsanticsat.html "Nossig's Antics at Theater for the New City"], ''The Villager'', May 4, 2004, retrieved February 7, 2011.</ref> The play was reviewed by Michael Smith in ''[[The Village Voice]]'' as "timeless, mythic, enlivened by all kinds of stylistic intrusions and an almost hysterical inventiveness."<ref name="bw">[http://offoffbroadway.broadwayworld.com/article/TNCs_New_City_New_Blood_Series_Premieres_SOLDIER_BOYS_119_20091108 BroadwayWorld.com], retrieved February 7, 2011.</ref>

Another of Smickes' off-off-Broadway productions, ''Nossig's Antics'', also a TNC production directed by Crystal Field, focuses on the character of Alfred Nossig, who was accused of collaborating with Nazis in the [[Warsaw Ghetto]], and executed in 1943, just before his 80th birthday, by a Jewish fighters organization.<ref name="mcbee">McBee, Richard, [http://www.jewishpress.com/pageroute.do/16311 ''The Jewish Press''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228144015/http://www.jewishpress.com/pageroute.do/16311/ |date=2010-12-28 }}, June 2, 2004, retrieved February 7, 2011.</ref> The critic Richard McBee called it "a riveting puzzle,"<ref name="BW"/> and it has also been described as a "dark farce" and an "absurd exploration of history and the horrific times we live in."<ref name="mcbee"/>

His other plays include ''Minutes'', a fictional encounter between [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Gustav Mahler]]; "Soldier Boys" about [[Nicholas I of Russia|Czar Nicholas]]'s 1827 edict to recruit Jews into the Russian army for the first time, including children as [[Cadet]]s, which had a reading at [[Theater for the New City]] with [[Judd Hirsch]] as the Czar; and "Open Rehearsal," chosen by [[Edward Albee]] as first runner-up in the inaugural 2006-2007 Yale Drama Series Competition,<ref name="BW"/>  He also wrote the screenplay for [[Sidney Lumet]]'s movie version of ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (novel)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]'', which has not yet been produced.<ref name="tallmer"/>

===Novelist and translator===
Simckes's first published work was a translation of two stories by the Israeli author, [[S. Y. Agnon]], followed by the short story, "Behold My Servant!", published in Stanford Short Stories 1962.<ref name="Seven"/>  His novels include ''Seven Days in Mourning'' and ''The Comatose Kids''.  He has translated a number of works from Hebrew to English, including ''[[Adam Resurrected]]'',<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,905398,00.html|title=Books: Rags and Bones|date=1971-07-19|work=Time|access-date=2020-02-29|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}</ref> ''The Chocolate Deal'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsupress.wayne.edu/books/subjects/jewish-studies|title=Jewish Studies {{!}} Wayne State University Press|website=www.wsupress.wayne.edu|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> and ''Commander of the Exodus''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Fact+and+Fiction+by+Yoram+Kaniuk.-a070450990|title=Fact and Fiction by Yoram Kaniuk. - Free Online Library|website=www.thefreelibrary.com|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>  He also translated Nava Semel's children's book, ''Becoming Gershona'', about a twelve-year-old girl in 1958 [[Tel Aviv]],<ref>[http://www.alibris.com/booksearch?qwork=607289&matches=33&browse=1&subject=Tel+Aviv+Israel&cm_sp=works*listing*title Alibris.com], retrieved February 7, 2011.</ref> which won the [[National Jewish Book Award]] for Children's Literature.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.jewishbookcouncil.org/awards/national-jewish-book-awards/past-winners?category=30737|title=Past Winners of the National Jewish Book Award for Children's Literature|last=|first=|date=|website=Jewish Book Council|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>

In addition to Hebrew, Simckes is fluent in [[Yiddish]], and according to the director of the film ''Kvetch'', [[Austin Kase]], Simckes was one of the inspirations for the movie, and also appeared in it.<ref>Claudell, Matthew, [http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2010/oct/08/kvetch-director-schvitzes-out-movie "Kvetch director schvitzes out a movie"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227043615/http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2010/oct/08/kvetch-director-schvitzes-out-movie/ |date=2011-02-27 }}, October 8, 2010, ''Yale News''</ref>

===Psychotherapist===
As a practicing psychotherapist, Simckes has worked with multi-problem families and imprisoned [[sex offender]]s.<ref name="BW"/>

An article in ''The Israeli Fulbrighter'' notes that Simckes found a "dual vocation as a writer and healer."<ref name="fulbright"/>  After studying at the Kantor Family Institute in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], he began using brief writing assignments with patients in [[Massachusetts]] and [[Rhode Island]], to help them deal with their problems. He continued working on this idea and eventually launched writing workshops in community centers, "attempting to foster literacy, empathy, listening skills, insight, respect, and resolution of conflict."  He believes writing exercises are especially effective because "they serve to highlight the problem in a way that it can be dealt with."<ref name="fulbright"/>

===Cross-cultural educator===
Simckes has tried to bring all his talents and experiences to bear in his efforts among Israelis and [[Palestinians]].  He made "fostering cross-cultural insights and empathy" in the "interlocked perspectives surrounding the Arab/Israeli encounter" the core of his Fulbright year in Israel, at the University of Haifa.<ref name="fulbright"/>

Among his initiatives were a creative writing seminar, "The Mirror of Fiction", and a two-way live interactive video workshop, "Celebrating Differences", broadcast on February 27, 1996.  The live interactive TV seminar linked American high school students in the United States with Jewish and Arab students (both Israeli and Palestinian) in Israel.  "He created a live bridge and prompted the participants to share their experiences on handling differences," helping the students gain new insights about one another.<ref name="fulbright"/>

To prepare for the Israeli video program, broadcast through the [[Massachusetts Corporation for Educational Telecommunications]], Simckes made frequent visits to [[Nazareth]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20101210073610/http://www.beit-hagefen.com/En_Web/En_%20Home_Index.htm Beit Hagefen], and [[Jish]] to find students who were comfortable with writing spontaneously, and sharing their writing on the air—and prepared to listen, not just "to yell at each other."<ref name="fulbright"/>

==== Use of language ====
Simckes has strong feelings about the use of English in workshops that involve both Israeli and Palestinians, because it is a "bridge language" and a "diffuser of power" in a political sense, interrupting "the implication of power through language."<ref name="fulbright"/>

He believes that the ability to listen is critical to both writing and healing, and hopes his writing workshops strengthen that skill.  If people "can hear each other," he says, "they become a community."<ref name="fulbright"/>

From 2019-2020 he taught the Bar Ilan University course "A Prose Laboratory," focusing on spontaneous writing.

==Awards==
His awards include two National Endowment of the Arts fellowships and the 1991 National Jewish Book Award in the Children's Literature category.<ref name=":0" /> Simckes received the Best Actor award for his performance in the award-winning comedy short-film, Kvetch.<ref name="fulbright"/>
