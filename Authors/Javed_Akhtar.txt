Akhtar came to recognition in the duo [[Salim–Javed]], and earned his breakthrough as a screenwriter with 1973's [[Zanjeer (1973 film)|''Zanjeer'']]. He went on to write the films [[Deewaar|''Deewar'']] and ''[[Sholay]]'', both released in 1975; they earned a [[cult following]], and had a significant impact in [[popular culture]]. He later earned praise for his work as a [[lyricist]], winning the [[National Film Award for Best Lyrics]] five times and the [[Filmfare Award for Best Lyricist]] eight times.

Akhtar notably campaigned for the [[Communist Party of India]] (CPI) and their candidate in the [[2019 Indian general election]], and was a member of parliament in [[Rajya Sabha]].<ref>[https://news.rediff.com/report/2010/mar/19/president-appoints-5-new-members-to-rajya-sabha.htm President appoints 5 new members to Rajya Sabha]</ref> For his work, he received the [[Richard Dawkins Award]] in 2020,<ref name="dawkins" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thequint.com/entertainment/celebrities/javed-akhtar-becomes-only-indian-to-win-richard-dawkins-award|title = Javed Akhtar Becomes Only Indian to Win Richard Dawkins Award|date = 7 June 2020}}</ref> and was chosen as a recipient for the [[Richard Dawkins Award]].<ref name="centerforinquiry.org">{{Cite web|url=https://centerforinquiry.org/press_releases/javed-akhtar-wins-richard-dawkins-award/|title=Writer, Poet, Lyricist, and Atheist Activist Javed Akhtar Wins Richard Dawkins Award &#124; Center for Inquiry|date=9 June 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fidalgo |first1=Paul |title=Richard Dawkins award goes to writer-lyricist Javed Akhtar |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2020 |volume=45 |issue=5 |page=6}}</ref>

==Early life==
Javed Akhtar was born in 1945 in [[Gwalior]].<ref>{{cite book |editor=Ashish Rajadhyaksha and Paul Willemen |title=Encyclopedia of Indian Cinema |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SLkABAAAQBAJ&pg=PA204 |date=10 July 2014 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-135-94318-9 |page=204 }}</ref> His father [[Jan Nisar Akhtar]] was a [[Bollywood]] film songwriter and [[Urdu]] poet.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/on-fathers-day-javed-akhtar-recalls-the-man-who-taught-him-poetry/article6117318.ece|title=On Father's Day, Javed Akhtar recalls the man who taught him poetry|date=16 June 2014|newspaper=The Hindu}}</ref> His grandfather [[Muztar Khairabadi]] was a poet as was his grandfather's elder brother, Bismil Khairabadi, while his great great grandfather, [[Fazl-e-Haq Khairabadi]], was a scholar of Islamic studies and theology and played an important role in the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|First Independence Movement of India in 1857]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-01-16|title=Happy Birthday Javed Akhtar: 10 best quotes from the legendary lyricist and writer|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/art-and-culture/happy-birthday-javed-akhtar-10-best-quotes-from-the-legendary-lyricist-and-writer/story-nMOML8p1DiO13gS1s5nraJ.html|access-date=2021-07-23|website=Hindustan Times|language=en}}</ref> Javed Akhtar's original name was Jadoo, taken from a line in a poem written by his father: "Lamha, lamha kisi jadoo ka fasana hoga".

==Career as scriptwriter==
{{main|Salim-Javed}}

Initially, in the 1970s, there was generally no concept of having the same writer for the screenplay, story and dialogue, nor were the writers given any credits in the titles. [[Rajesh Khanna]] is credited with giving [[Salim Khan]] and Javed Akhtar their first chance to become screenplay writers by offering them work in ''[[Haathi Mere Saathi (1971 film)|Haathi Mere Saathi]]''.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-07-19/news-interviews/32731341_1_rajesh-khanna-consecutive-solo-superhits-record-in-indian-film | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202231114/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-07-19/news-interviews/32731341_1_rajesh-khanna-consecutive-solo-superhits-record-in-indian-film | url-status=dead | archive-date=2013-12-02 | work=[[The Times of India]] | title=More facts about Rajesh Khanna}}</ref> Javed Akhtar stated in an interview that one day, he went to [[Salim Khan|Salimsaab]] and said that Mr. Devar had given him a huge signing amount with which he could complete the payment for his bungalow, Aashirwad. But the film was a remake and the script of the original was far from being satisfactory. "He told us that if we could set right the script, he would make sure we got both money and credit."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/movies/features/type/view/id/3718/|title=The Magic of Haathi Mere Saathi - Latest Movie Features - Bollywood Hungama|first=Bollywood|last=Hungama}}</ref>

Their first big success was the script for [[Andaz (1971 film)|''Andaz'']], followed by ''[[Adhikar (1971 film)|Adhikar]]'' (1971), ''[[Haathi Mere Saathi (1971 film)|Haathi Mere Saathi]]'' and ''[[Seeta Aur Geeta]]'' (1972). They also had hits with ''[[Yaadon Ki Baaraat]]'' (1973), ''[[Zanjeer (1973 film)|Zanjeer]]'' (1973), ''[[Haath Ki Safai]]'' (1974), ''[[Deewaar]]'' (1975), ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975), ''[[Chacha Bhatija]]'' (1977), ''[[Don (1978 film)|Don]]'' (1978), ''[[Trishul (film)|Trishul]]'' (1978), ''[[Dostana (1980 film)|Dostana]]'' (1980), ''[[Kranti]]'' (1981), ''[[Zamana (1985 film)|Zamana]]'' (1985) and ''[[Mr. India (1987 film)|Mr. India]]'' (1987). They have worked together in 24 films including two [[Kannada]] films – ''[[Premada Kanike]]'' and ''[[Raja Nanna Raja]]''.

Of the 24 films they wrote, 20 were hits. The scripts they wrote, but which were not successful at box office include ''[[Aakhri Daao|Aakhri Dao]]'' (1975), ''[[Immaan Dharam]]'' (1977), ''[[Kaala Patthar]]'' (1979) and ''[[Shaan (1980 film)|Shaan]]'' (1980). Though they split in 1982, due to ego issues, some of the scripts they wrote were made into hit films later, such as ''[[Zamaana Deewana|Zamana]]'' and ''[[Mr. India (1987 film)|Mr. India]]''. Salim-Javed, many a time described as "the most successful scriptwriters of all-time",<ref>Sholay, through the eyes of Salim Khan, ''[http://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-interview-with-salim-khan/20120228.htm]'', Rediff.com</ref> are also noted to be the first scriptwriters in [[Cinema of India|Indian cinema]] to achieve star status.<ref>Ramesh Dawar (2003), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8y8vN9A14nkC Encyclopaedia of Hindi cinema]'', Encyclopædia Britannica (India) Pvt.
