'''Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni''' ({{IPA-it|mikeˈlandʒelo di lodoˈviːko ˌbwɔnarˈrɔːti siˈmoːni|lang}}; 6 March 1475&nbsp;– 18 February 1564), known simply as '''Michelangelo''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|ˌ|m|aɪ|k|əl|'|æ|n|dʒ|ə|l|oʊ|,_|ˌ|m|I|k|-}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Wells|first=John|author-link=John C.

He is often considered a contender for the title of the archetypal [[Renaissance man]], along with his rival and elder contemporary, [[Leonardo da Vinci]].<ref name="Britannica">{{Britannica|379957}}</ref> Given the sheer volume of surviving correspondence, sketches, and reminiscences, Michelangelo is among best-documented artist of the 16th century and several scholars have described Michelangelo as the most accomplished artist of his era.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BQd-AwAAQBAJ&q=Life+of+Michelangelo+Symonds|title=The Life of Michelangelo|first=John|last=Symonds|date=9 January 2019|publisher=BookRix|isbn=9783736804630|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wr0UDAAAQBAJ&q=vasari+lives+of+the+artists&pg=PR15|title=The Lives of the Artists|first=Giorgio|last=Vasari|date=14 August 2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199537198|via=Google Books}}</ref>

He sculpted two of his best-known works, the ''[[Pietà (Michelangelo)|Pietà]]'' and ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'', before the age of thirty. Despite holding a low opinion of painting, he also created two of the most influential [[fresco]]es in the history of Western art: the scenes from Genesis on the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling|ceiling of the Sistine Chapel]] in Rome, and ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgment]]'' on its altar wall. His design of the [[Laurentian Library]] pioneered [[Mannerism#Mannerist architecture|Mannerist architecture]].<ref>Hughes, A., & Elam, C. (2003). "Michelangelo". ''Oxford Art Online''. Retrieved 14 April 2018, from http://www.oxfordartonline.com</ref> At the age of 74, he succeeded [[Antonio da Sangallo the Younger]] as the architect of [[St. Peter's Basilica]]. He transformed the plan so that the western end was finished to his design, as was the dome, with some modification, after his death.

Michelangelo was the first Western artist whose [[biography]] was published while he was alive.<ref name="Britannica"/> In fact, two biographies were published during his lifetime. One of them, by [[Giorgio Vasari]], proposed that Michelangelo's work transcended that of any artist living or dead, and was "supreme in not one art alone but in all three."<ref>Smithers, Tamara. 2016. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=-fKcCwAAQBAJ&pg=PR7&dq= Michelangelo in the New Millennium: Conversations about Artistic Practice, Patronage and Christianity]''. Boston: Brill. p. vii. {{ISBN|978-90-04-31362-0}}.</ref>

In his lifetime, Michelangelo was often called ''Il Divino'' ("the divine one").<ref>{{cite book|last=Emison|first=Patricia.

==Life==

===Early life, 1475–1488===
Michelangelo was born on 6 March 1475{{ref label|a|a|none}} in [[Caprese Michelangelo|Caprese]], known today as Caprese Michelangelo, a small town situated in Valtiberina,<ref>[http://www.cm-valtiberina.toscana.it/ Unione Montana dei Comuni della Valtiberina Toscana], www.cm-valtiberina.toscana.it</ref> near [[Arezzo]], [[Tuscany]].<ref name="Tolnay11">J. de Tolnay, ''The Youth of Michelangelo'', p. 11</ref> For several generations, his family had been small-scale bankers in [[Florence]]; but the bank failed, and his father, Ludovico di Leonardo Buonarroti Simoni, briefly took a government post in Caprese, where Michelangelo was born.<ref name="Britannica"/> At the time of Michelangelo's birth, his father was the town's [[Magistrate|judicial administrator]] and ''[[podestà]]'' or local administrator of [[Chiusi della Verna]]. Michelangelo's mother was Francesca di Neri del Miniato di Siena.<ref name="clement5">C. Clément, ''Michelangelo'', p. 5</ref> The Buonarrotis claimed to descend from the Countess [[Mathilde of Canossa]]—a claim that remains unproven, but which Michelangelo believed.<ref>A. Condivi, ''The Life of Michelangelo'', p. 5</ref>

Several months after Michelangelo's birth, the family returned to Florence, where he was raised. During his mother's later prolonged illness, and after her death in 1481 (when he was six years old), Michelangelo lived with a nanny and her husband, a stonecutter, in the town of [[Settignano]], where his father owned a marble quarry and a small farm.<ref name="clement5"/> There he gained his love for marble. As [[Giorgio Vasari]] quotes him:
{{quote|If there is some good in me, it is because I was born in the subtle atmosphere of your country of Arezzo. Along with the milk of my nurse I received the knack of handling chisel and hammer, with which I make my figures.<ref name="Tolnay11"/>}}

===Apprenticeships, 1488–1492===
[[File:Buonarotti-scala.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Madonna of the Stairs]]'' (1490–1492), Michelangelo's earliest known work in marble]]
As a young boy, Michelangelo was sent to [[Florence]] to study [[grammar]] under the [[Renaissance Humanism|Humanist]] Francesco da Urbino.<ref name="Tolnay11"/><ref name="Condivi9">A. Condivi, ''The Life of Michelangelo'', p. 9</ref>{{ref label|b|b|none}} However, he showed no interest in his schooling, preferring to copy paintings from churches and seek the company of other painters.<ref name="Condivi9"/>

The city of Florence was at that time Italy's greatest centre of the arts and learning.<ref name=Coughlan14>Coughlan, Robert; (1978), ''The World of Michelangelo'', Time-Life; pp. 14–15</ref> Art was sponsored by the Signoria (the town council), the merchant guilds, and wealthy patrons such as the [[Medici]] and their banking associates.<ref name=Coughlan35>Coughlan, pp. 35–40</ref> The [[Renaissance]], a renewal of [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] scholarship and the arts, had its first flowering in Florence.<ref name=Coughlan14/> In the early 15th century, the architect [[Filippo Brunelleschi]], having studied the remains of Classical buildings in Rome, had created two churches, [[San Lorenzo, Florence|San Lorenzo's]] and [[Santo Spirito, Florence|Santo Spirito]], which embodied the Classical precepts.<ref>Giovanni Fanelli, (1980) ''Brunelleschi'', Becocci Firenze, pp. 3–10</ref> The sculptor [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] had laboured for fifty years to create the bronze doors of the [[Florence Baptistery|Baptistry]], which Michelangelo was to describe as "The Gates of Paradise".<ref>H. Gardner, p. 408</ref> The exterior niches of the Church of [[Orsanmichele]] contained a gallery of works by the most acclaimed sculptors of Florence: [[Donatello]], Ghiberti, [[Andrea del Verrocchio]], and [[Nanni di Banco]].<ref name=Coughlan35/> The interiors of the older churches were covered with frescos (mostly in Late Medieval, but also in the Early Renaissance style), begun by [[Giotto]] and continued by [[Masaccio]] in the [[Brancacci Chapel]], both of whose works Michelangelo studied and copied in drawings.<ref name=Coughlan28>Coughlan, pp. 28–32</ref>

During Michelangelo's childhood, a team of painters had been called from Florence to the Vatican to decorate the walls of the [[Sistine Chapel]]. Among them was [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], a master in fresco painting, perspective, figure drawing and portraiture who had the largest workshop in Florence.<ref name=Coughlan35/> In 1488, at age 13, Michelangelo was apprenticed to Ghirlandaio.<ref name="Liebert59">R. Liebert, ''Michelangelo: A Psychoanalytic Study of his Life and Images'', p. 59</ref> The next year, his father persuaded Ghirlandaio to pay Michelangelo as an artist, which was rare for someone of fourteen.<ref>C. Clément, ''Michelangelo'', p. 7</ref> When in 1489, [[Lorenzo de' Medici]], de facto ruler of Florence, asked Ghirlandaio for his two best pupils, Ghirlandaio sent Michelangelo and [[Francesco Granacci]].<ref>C. Clément, ''Michelangelo'', p. 9</ref>

From 1490 to 1492, Michelangelo attended the [[Platonic Academy (Florence)|Platonic Academy]], a Humanist academy founded by the Medici. There, his work and outlook were influenced by many of the most prominent philosophers and writers of the day, including [[Marsilio Ficino]], [[Pico della Mirandola]] and [[Poliziano]].<ref name="Tolnay1819">J. de Tolnay, ''The Youth of Michelangelo'', pp. 18–19</ref> At this time, Michelangelo sculpted the reliefs ''[[Madonna of the Steps]]'' (1490–1492) and ''[[Battle of the Centaurs (Michelangelo)|Battle of the Centaurs]]'' (1491–1492),<ref name=Coughlan28/> the latter based on a theme suggested by Poliziano and commissioned by Lorenzo de' Medici.<ref name="Condivi15">A. Condivi, ''The Life of Michelangelo'', p. 15</ref> Michelangelo worked for a time with the sculptor [[Bertoldo di Giovanni]]. When he was seventeen, another pupil, [[Pietro Torrigiano]], struck him on the nose, causing the disfigurement that is conspicuous in the portraits of Michelangelo.<ref>Coughlan, p. 42</ref>

===Bologna, Florence and Rome, 1492–1499===
[[File:Michelangelo's Pieta 5450 cut out black.jpg|thumb|280px|''[[Pietà (Michelangelo)|Pietà]]'', St Peter's Basilica (1498–99)]]
Lorenzo de' Medici's death on 8 April 1492 brought a reversal of Michelangelo's circumstances.<ref name="Tolnay2021">J. de Tolnay, ''The Youth of Michelangelo'', pp. 20–21</ref> Michelangelo left the security of the Medici court and returned to his father's house. In the following months he carved a polychrome wooden ''[[Crucifix (Michelangelo)|Crucifix]]'' (1493), as a gift to the prior of the Florentine church of Santo Spirito, which had allowed him to do some [[anatomical]] studies of the corpses from the church's hospital.<ref name="Condivi17">A. Condivi, ''The Life of Michelangelo'', p. 17</ref> This was the first of several instances during his career that Michelangelo studied anatomy by dissecting cadavers.<ref>Laurenzo, Domenico (2012).

Between 1493 and 1494 he bought a block of marble, and carved a larger-than-life statue of [[Hercules]], which was sent to France and subsequently disappeared sometime in the 18th century.<ref name="Condivi15" />{{ref label|c|c|none}} On 20 January 1494, after heavy snowfalls, Lorenzo's heir, [[Piero di Lorenzo de' Medici|Piero de Medici]], commissioned a snow statue, and Michelangelo again entered the court of the Medici.<ref>{{cite book|last=Coughlan|first=Robert|title=The World of Michelangelo: 1475–1564|url=https://archive.org/details/worldofmichaelan0000unse|url-access=limited|others=et al|publisher=Time-Life Books|year=1966|page=[https://archive.org/details/worldofmichaelan0000unse/page/67 67]}}</ref>

In the same year, the Medici were expelled from Florence as the result of the rise of [[Savonarola]]. Michelangelo left the city before the end of the political upheaval, moving to [[Venice]] and then to [[Bologna]].<ref name="Tolnay2021" /> In Bologna, he was commissioned to carve several of the last small figures for the completion of the [[Arca di San Domenico|Shrine of St. Dominic]], in the church dedicated to that saint. At this time Michelangelo studied the robust reliefs carved by [[Jacopo della Quercia]] around the main portal of the [[San Petronio Basilica|Basilica of St Petronius]], including the panel of ''The Creation of Eve'', the composition of which was to reappear on the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]].<ref>Bartz and König, p. 54</ref> Towards the end of 1495, the political situation in Florence was calmer; the city, previously under threat from the French, was no longer in danger as [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]] had suffered defeats. Michelangelo returned to Florence but received no commissions from the new city government under Savonarola.<ref>Miles Unger, ''Michelangelo: a Life in Six Masterpieces'', ch. 1</ref> He returned to the employment of the Medici.<ref name="Tolnay2425">J. de Tolnay, ''The Youth of Michelangelo'', pp. 24–25</ref> During the half-year he spent in Florence, he worked on two small statues, a child ''St. John the Baptist'' and a sleeping ''[[Cupid (Michelangelo)|Cupid]]''. According to Condivi, [[Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]], for whom Michelangelo had sculpted ''St. John the Baptist'', asked that Michelangelo "fix it so that it looked as if it had been buried" so he could "send it to Rome&nbsp;... pass [it off as] an ancient work and&nbsp;... sell it much better." Both Lorenzo and Michelangelo were unwittingly cheated out of the real value of the piece by a middleman. Cardinal [[Raffaele Riario]], to whom Lorenzo had sold it, discovered that it was a fraud, but was so impressed by the quality of the sculpture that he invited the artist to Rome.<ref name="Condivi1920">A. Condivi, ''The Life of Michelangelo'', pp. 19–20</ref> {{ref label|d|d|none}} This apparent success in selling his sculpture abroad as well as the conservative Florentine situation may have encouraged Michelangelo to accept the prelate's invitation.<ref name="Tolnay2425" />
Michelangelo arrived in Rome on 25 June 1496<ref name="Tolnay2628">J. de Tolnay, ''The Youth of Michelangelo'', pp. 26–28</ref> at the age of 21. On 4 July of the same year, he began work on a commission for Cardinal Riario, an over-life-size statue of the Roman wine god ''[[Bacchus (Michelangelo)|Bacchus]]''. Upon completion, the work was rejected by the cardinal, and subsequently entered the collection of the banker Jacopo Galli, for his garden.

In November 1497, the French ambassador to the Holy See, Cardinal [[Jean Bilhères de Lagraulas|Jean de Bilhères-Lagraulas]], commissioned him to carve a ''[[Pietà (Michelangelo)|Pietà]]'', a sculpture showing the [[St Mary|Virgin Mary]] grieving over the body of Jesus. The subject, which is not part of the Biblical narrative of the Crucifixion, was common in religious sculpture of Medieval Northern Europe and would have been very familiar to the Cardinal.<ref name=Hirst47/> The contract was agreed upon in August of the following year. Michelangelo was 24 at the time of its completion.<ref name=Hirst47>Hirst and Dunkerton pp. 47–55</ref> It was soon to be regarded as one of the world's great masterpieces of sculpture, "a revelation of all the potentialities and force of the art of sculpture". Contemporary opinion was summarised by Vasari: "It is certainly a miracle that a formless block of stone could ever have been reduced to a perfection that nature is scarcely able to create in the flesh."<ref>Vasari, ''Lives of the painters: Michelangelo''</ref> It is now located in [[St Peter's Basilica]].

===Florence, 1499–1505===
{{Main|David (Michelangelo)}}
[[File:Michelangelo's David - right view 2.jpg|thumb|left|The ''[[David (Michelangelo)|Statue of David]]'', completed by Michelangelo in 1504, is one of the most renowned works of the Renaissance.]]
Michelangelo returned to Florence in 1499. The [[Republic of Florence|Republic]] was changing after the fall of its leader, anti-Renaissance priest [[Girolamo Savonarola]], who was executed in 1498, and the rise of the ''gonfaloniere'' [[Piero Soderini]]. Michelangelo was asked by the consuls of the Guild of Wool to complete an unfinished project begun 40 years earlier by [[Agostino di Duccio]]: a colossal statue of [[Carrara marble]] portraying David as a symbol of Florentine freedom to be placed on the gable of [[Florence Cathedral]].<ref name=Paoletti387>Paoletti and Radke, pp. 387–89</ref> Michelangelo responded by completing his most famous work, the [[David (Michelangelo)|statue of David]], in 1504. The masterwork definitively established his prominence as a sculptor of extraordinary technical skill and strength of symbolic imagination. A team of consultants, including [[Botticelli]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Filippino Lippi]], [[Pietro Perugino]], [[Lorenzo di Credi]], [[Antonio da Sangallo the Elder|Antonio]] and [[Giuliano da Sangallo]], [[Andrea della Robbia]], [[Cosimo Rosselli]], [[Davide Ghirlandaio]], [[Piero di Cosimo]], [[Andrea Sansovino]] and Michelangelo's dear friend [[Francesco Granacci]], was called together to decide upon its placement, ultimately the Piazza della Signoria, in front of the [[Palazzo Vecchio]]. It now stands in the [[Galleria dell'Accademia|Academia]] while a replica occupies its place in the square.<ref>Goldscheider, p. 10</ref>
In the same period of placing the [[David (Michelangelo)|David]], Michelangelo may have been involved in creating the [[Importuno di Michelangelo|sculptural profile on Palazzo Vecchio]]'s façade known as the [[Importuno di Michelangelo]]. The hypothesis<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last=Marinazzo|first=Adriano|date=2020|title=Una nuova possible attribuzione a Michelangelo. Il Volto Misterioso|url=https://www.academia.edu/44494234|journal=Art e Dossier|volume=379|pages=76–81}}</ref> on Michelangelo's possible involvement in the creation of the profile is based on the strong resemblance of the latter to a profile drawn by the artist, datable to the beginning of the 16th century, now preserved in the [[Louvre]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Avant Banksy et Invader, Michel-Ange pionnier du street art dans les rues de Florence|url=https://www.lefigaro.fr/culture/avant-banksy-et-invader-michel-ange-pionnier-du-street-art-dans-les-rues-de-florence-20201122|access-date=2021-04-11|website=LEFIGARO|date=22 November 2020|language=fr}}</ref>

With the completion of the ''David'' came another commission. In early 1504 Leonardo da Vinci had been commissioned to paint ''[[The Battle of Anghiari (painting)|The Battle of Anghiari]]'' in the council chamber of the Palazzo Vecchio, depicting the [[Battle of Anghiari|battle between Florence and Milan]] in 1440. Michelangelo was then commissioned to paint the ''[[Battle of Cascina (Michelangelo)|Battle of Cascina]]''. The two paintings are very different: Leonardo depicts soldiers fighting on horseback, while Michelangelo has soldiers being ambushed as they bathe in the river. Neither work was completed and both were lost forever when the chamber was refurbished. Both works were much admired, and copies remain of them, Leonardo's work having been copied by [[Rubens]] and Michelangelo's by [[Bastiano da Sangallo]].<ref>Paoletti and Radke, pp. 392–93</ref>

Also during this period, Michelangelo was commissioned by Angelo Doni to paint a "[[Holy Family]]" as a present for his wife, Maddalena Strozzi. It is known as the ''[[Doni Tondo]]'' and hangs in the Uffizi Gallery in its original magnificent frame, which Michelangelo may have designed.<ref name="Goldscheider, p. 11">Goldscheider, p. 11</ref><ref>Hirst and Dunkerton, p. 127</ref> He also may have painted the Madonna and Child with [[John the Baptist]], known as the ''[[Manchester Madonna]]'' and now in the [[National Gallery]], London.<ref>Hirst and Dunkerton, pp. 83–105, 336–46</ref>

===Tomb of Julius II, 1505-1545===
{{Main|Tomb of Pope Julius II}}
[[File:'Moses' by Michelangelo JBU010.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tomb of Julius II]], 1505-1545]]
In 1505 Michelangelo was invited back to Rome by the newly elected [[Pope Julius II]] and commissioned to build the [[Tomb of Pope Julius II|Pope's tomb]], which was to include forty statues and be finished in five years.<ref name="Goldcheider14">Goldscheider, pp. 14–16</ref> Under the patronage of the pope, Michelangelo experienced constant interruptions to his work on the tomb in order to accomplish numerous other tasks.

On the pendentives supporting the ceiling are painted twelve men and women who prophesied the coming of Jesus, seven [[prophet]]s of Israel, and five [[Sibyl]]s, prophetic women of the Classical world.<ref name= Goldscheider12/> Among the most famous paintings on the ceiling are [[The Creation of Adam]], [[Adam and Eve]] in the [[Garden of Eden]], the [[Deluge myth|Deluge]], the Prophet [[Jeremiah]], and the [[Cumaean Sibyl]].

===Florence under Medici popes, 1513 – early 1534===

In 1513, Pope Julius II died and was succeeded by [[Pope Leo X]], the second son of Lorenzo de' Medici.<ref name=Bartz134/> From 1513 to 1516 Pope Leo was on good terms with Pope Julius's surviving relatives, so encouraged Michelangelo to continue work on Julius's tomb, but the families became enemies again in 1516 when Pope Leo tried to seize the [[Duchy of Urbino]] from Julius's nephew [[Francesco Maria I della Rovere]].<ref>Miles Unger, ''Michelangelo: a Life in Six Masterpieces'', ch. 5</ref> Pope Leo then had Michelangelo stop working on the tomb, and commissioned him to reconstruct the façade of the [[Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence|Basilica of San Lorenzo in Florence]] and to adorn it with sculptures. He spent three years creating drawings and models for the façade, as well as attempting to open a new marble quarry at [[Pietrasanta]] specifically for the project.  In 1520 the work was abruptly cancelled by his financially strapped patrons before any real progress had been made. The basilica lacks a façade to this day.<ref>Coughlan, pp. 135–36</ref>

In 1520 the Medici came back to Michelangelo with another grand proposal, this time for a family funerary chapel in the Basilica of San Lorenzo.<ref name=Bartz134/> For posterity, this project, occupying the artist for much of the 1520s and 1530s, was more fully realised.  Michelangelo used his own discretion to create the composition of the [[Medici Chapel]], which houses the large tombs of two of the younger members of the Medici family, Giuliano, Duke of Nemours, and Lorenzo, his nephew. It also serves to commemorate their more famous predecessors, [[Lorenzo the Magnificent]] and his brother Giuliano, who are buried nearby. The tombs display statues of the two Medici and allegorical figures representing ''[[Night (Michelangelo)|Night]]'' and ''[[Day (Michelangelo)|Day]]'', and ''[[Dusk (Michelangelo)|Dusk]]'' and ''[[Dawn (Michelangelo)|Dawn]]''. The chapel also contains Michelangelo's ''Medici Madonna''.<ref>Goldscheider, pp. 17–18</ref> In 1976 a concealed corridor was discovered with drawings on the walls that related to the chapel itself.<ref>[http://www.florentine-society.ru/Medici_Chapel_Mysteries.htm Peter Barenboim, Sergey Shiyan, ''Michelangelo: Mysteries of Medici Chapel'', SLOVO, Moscow, 2006]. {{ISBN|5-85050-825-2}}</ref><ref>Peter Barenboim, "Michelangelo Drawings – Key to the Medici Chapel Interpretation", Moscow, Letny Sad, 2006, {{ISBN|5-98856-016-4}}</ref>

Pope Leo X died in 1521 and was succeeded briefly by the austere [[Pope Adrian VI|Adrian VI]], and then by his cousin Giulio Medici as [[Pope Clement VII]].<ref>Coughlan, pp. 151–52</ref> In 1524 Michelangelo received an architectural commission from the Medici pope for the [[Laurentian Library]] at San Lorenzo's Church.<ref name=Bartz134/> He designed both the interior of the library itself and its vestibule, a building utilising architectural forms with such dynamic effect that it is seen as the forerunner of [[Baroque architecture]]. It was left to assistants to interpret his plans and carry out construction. The library was not opened until 1571, and the vestibule remained incomplete until 1904.<ref>Bartz and König, p. 87</ref>

In 1527, Florentine citizens, encouraged by the [[sack of Rome (1527)|sack of Rome]], threw out the Medici and restored the republic. A siege of the city ensued, and Michelangelo went to the aid of his beloved Florence by working on the city's fortifications from 1528 to 1529. The city fell in 1530, and the Medici were restored to power.<ref name=Bartz134/> Michelangelo fell out of favour with the young Alessandro Medici, who had been installed as the first Duke of Florence. Fearing for his life, he fled to Rome, leaving assistants to complete the Medici chapel and the Laurentian Library. Despite Michelangelo's support of the republic and resistance to the Medici rule, he was welcomed by Pope Clement, who reinstated an allowance that he had previously granted the artist and made a new contract with him over the tomb of Pope Julius.<ref>Coughlan, pp. 159–61</ref>

===Rome, 1534–1546===
[[File:Last Judgement by Michelangelo.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgment]]'' (1534–1541)]]

In Rome, Michelangelo lived near the church of [[Santa Maria di Loreto (Rome)|Santa Maria di Loreto]]. It was at this time that he met the poet [[Vittoria Colonna]], marchioness of [[Pescara]], who was to become one of his closest friends until her death in 1547.<ref name="A. Condivi p. 103">A. Condivi (ed. Hellmut Wohl), ''The Life of Michelangelo'', p. 103, Phaidon, 1976.</ref>

Shortly before his death in 1534, Pope Clement VII commissioned Michelangelo to paint a fresco of ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgment]]'' on the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel. His successor, [[Pope Paul III]], was instrumental in seeing that Michelangelo began and completed the project, which he laboured on from 1534 to October 1541.<ref name=Bartz134/> The fresco depicts the Second Coming of Christ and his Judgement of the souls. Michelangelo ignored the usual artistic conventions in portraying Jesus, showing him as a massive, muscular figure, youthful, beardless and naked.<ref name=Bartz100/> He is surrounded by saints, among whom [[Saint Bartholomew]] holds a drooping flayed skin, bearing the likeness of Michelangelo. The dead rise from their graves, to be consigned either to Heaven or to Hell.<ref name=Bartz100>Bartz and König, pp. 100–02</ref>

Once completed, the depiction of Christ and the Virgin Mary naked was considered sacrilegious, and [[Pope Paul IV|Cardinal Carafa]] and Monsignor Sernini ([[Mantua]]'s ambassador) campaigned to have the fresco removed or censored, but the Pope resisted. At the [[Council of Trent]], shortly before Michelangelo's death in 1564, it was decided to obscure the genitals and [[Daniele da Volterra]], an apprentice of Michelangelo, was commissioned to make the alterations.<ref>Bartz and König, pp. 102, 109</ref> An uncensored copy of the original, by [[Marcello Venusti]], is in the [[Museo di Capodimonte|Capodimonte Museum]] of [[Naples]].<ref name=LG19>Goldscheider, pp. 19–20</ref>

Michelangelo worked on a number of architectural projects at this time. They included a design for the [[Capitoline Hill]] with its trapezoid piazza displaying the ancient bronze statue of [[Marcus Aurelius]]. He designed the upper floor of the [[Palazzo Farnese]] and the interior of the Church of [[Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri|Santa Maria degli Angeli]], in which he transformed the vaulted interior of an Ancient Roman bathhouse. Other architectural works include [[San Giovanni dei Fiorentini]], the Sforza Chapel (Capella Sforza) in the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]] and the [[Porta Pia]].<ref>Goldscheider, pp. 8, 21, 22</ref>

===St Peter's Basilica, 1546–1564===
{{Main|St Peter's Basilica#Architecture}}
[[File:Basilique Saint-Pierre Vatican dome.jpg|left|thumb|The dome of [[St Peter's Basilica]]]]

While still working on the ''Last Judgment'', Michelangelo received yet another commission for the Vatican. This was for the painting of two large frescos in the Cappella Paolina depicting significant events in the lives of the two most important saints of Rome, the ''[[The Conversion of Saul (Michelangelo)|Conversion of Saint Paul]]'' and the ''[[The Crucifixion of St. Peter (Michelangelo)|Crucifixion of Saint Peter]]''. Like the ''Last Judgment'', these two works are complex compositions containing a great number of figures.<ref>Bartz and Kŏnig, p. 16</ref> They were completed in 1550. In the same year, Giorgio Vasari published his ''[[Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects|Vita]]'', including a biography of Michelangelo.<ref>Ilan Rachum, ''The Renaissance, an Illustrated Encyclopedia'', Octopus (1979) {{ISBN|0-7064-0857-8}}</ref>

In 1546, Michelangelo was appointed architect of [[St. Peter's Basilica]], Rome.<ref name=Bartz134/> The process of replacing the Constantinian basilica of the 4th century had been underway for fifty years and in 1506 foundations had been laid to the plans of Bramante. Successive architects had worked on it, but little progress had been made. Michelangelo was persuaded to take over the project.  He returned to the concepts of Bramante, and developed his ideas for a centrally planned church, strengthening the structure both physically and visually.<ref>Gardner, pp. 480–81</ref> The dome, not completed until after his death, has been called by [[Banister Fletcher]], "the greatest creation of the Renaissance".<ref>Banister Fletcher, 17th ed. p. 719</ref>

As construction was progressing on St Peter's, there was concern that Michelangelo would pass away before the dome was finished. However, once building commenced on the lower part of the dome, the supporting ring, the completion of the design was inevitable.

On 7 December 2007, a red chalk sketch for the dome of St Peter's Basilica, possibly the last made by Michelangelo before his death, was discovered in the Vatican archives. It is extremely rare, since he destroyed his designs later in life. The sketch is a partial plan for one of the radial columns of the cupola drum of Saint Peter's.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7133116.stm |title=Michelangelo 'last sketch' found |work=BBC News   |date=7 December 2007|access-date=9 February 2009}}</ref>

===Faith===
Michelangelo was a devout Catholic whose faith deepened at the end of his life.<ref>{{cite web |title=Crucifixion by Michelangelo, a drawing in black chalk |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/europe/michelangelos_drawings/crucifixion_by_michelangelo,_a.aspx |work=[[The British Museum]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015050539/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/europe/michelangelos_drawings/crucifixion_by_michelangelo,_a.aspx |archive-date=15 October 2015 |access-date=24 October 2018}}</ref> His poetry includes the following closing lines from what is known as poem 285 (written in 1554);
''"Neither painting nor sculpture will be able any longer to calm my soul, now turned toward that divine love that opened his arms on the cross to take us in."''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://arthum.college.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/PDFs/arthum_michel_reader.pdf |title=Michelangelo, Selected Poems |access-date=24 October 2018 |page=20 |work=[[Columbia University]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.michelangelo-gallery.com/poems.aspx |title=Michelangelo's Poetry |translator-first=H.W. |translator-last=Longfellow |work=Michelangelo Gallery |publisher=Studio of the South |access-date=24 October 2018}}</ref>

===Personal habits===
Michelangelo was abstemious in his personal life, and once told his apprentice, [[Ascanio Condivi]]: "However rich I may have been, I have always lived like a poor man."<ref name=CondiviLOM106>Condivi, ''The Life of Michelangelo'', p. 106.</ref> Condivi said he was indifferent to food and drink, eating "more out of necessity than of pleasure"<ref name=CondiviLOM106/> and that he "often slept in his clothes and&nbsp;... boots."<ref name=CondiviLOM106/> His biographer [[Paolo Giovio]] says, "His nature was so rough and uncouth that his domestic habits were incredibly squalid, and deprived posterity of any pupils who might have followed him."<ref>Paola Barocchi (ed.) ''Scritti d'arte del cinquecento'', Milan, 1971; vol. I p. 10.</ref> This, however, may not have affected him, as he was by nature a solitary and melancholy person, {{lang|it|bizzarro e fantastico}}, a man who "withdrew himself from the company of men."<ref name="Condivi">Condivi, p. 102.</ref>

===Relationships and poetry===
It is impossible to know for certain whether Michelangelo had physical relationships ([[Ascanio Condivi|Condivi]] ascribed to him a "monk-like chastity");<ref>Hughes, Anthony, "Michelangelo", p. 326. Phaidon, 1997.</ref> speculation about his sexuality is rooted in his poetry.<ref>Scigliano, Eric: [http://books.simonandschuster.ca/9780743254779 "Michelangelo's Mountain; The Quest for Perfection in the Marble Quarries of Carrara"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630155910/http://books.simonandschuster.ca/9780743254779 |date=30 June 2009 }}, Simon and Schuster, 2005. Retrieved 27 January 2007</ref> He wrote over three hundred sonnets and [[wikt:madrigal|madrigals]]. The longest sequence, displaying deep romantic feeling, was written to [[Tommaso dei Cavalieri]] ({{circa|1509–1587}}), who was 23 years old when Michelangelo met him in 1532, at the age of 57. These make up the first large sequence of poems in any modern tongue addressed by one man to another; they predate by 50 years [[Shakespeare]]'s [[Shakespeare's sonnets|sonnets]] to the fair youth:
{|
|-
|<poem>
:''I feel as lit by fire a cold countenance''
:''That burns me from afar and keeps itself ice-chill;''
:''A strength I feel two shapely arms to fill''
:''Which without motion moves every balance.''</poem>
::— (Michael Sullivan, translation)
|}

Cavalieri replied: "I swear to return your love. Never have I loved a man more than I love you, never have I wished for a friendship more than I wish for yours." Cavalieri remained devoted to Michelangelo until his death.<ref name="Hughes, Anthony p. 326">Hughes, Anthony: "Michelangelo", p. 326. Phaidon, 1997.</ref>

In 1542, Michelangelo met [[Cecchino dei Bracci]] who died only a year later, inspiring Michelangelo to write 48 funeral [[wikt:epigram|epigrams]]. Some of the objects of Michelangelo's affections, and subjects of his poetry, took advantage of him: the model [[Febo di Poggio]] asked for money in response to a love-poem, and a second model, [[Gherardo Perini]], stole from him shamelessly.<ref name="Hughes, Anthony p. 326"/>

What some have interpreted as the seemingly [[homoeroticism|homoerotic]] nature of the poetry has been a source of discomfort to later generations. Michelangelo's grandnephew, [[Michelangelo Buonarroti the Younger]], published the poems in 1623 with the gender of pronouns changed,<ref>Rictor Norton, "The Myth of the Modern Homosexual", p. 143. Cassell, 1997.</ref> and it was not until [[John Addington Symonds]] translated them into English in 1893 that the original genders were restored. In modern times some scholars insist that, despite the restoration of the pronouns, they represent "an emotionless and elegant re-imagining of Platonic dialogue, whereby erotic poetry was seen as an expression of refined sensibilities".<ref name="Hughes, Anthony p. 326"/>

Late in life, Michelangelo nurtured a great platonic love for the poet and noble widow [[Vittoria Colonna]], whom he met in Rome in 1536 or 1538 and who was in her late forties at the time. They wrote sonnets for each other and were in regular contact until she died. These sonnets mostly deal with the spiritual issues that occupied them.<ref>Vittoria Colonna, Sonnets for Michelangelo. A Bilingual Edition edited and translated by Abigail Brundin, The University of Chicago Press 2005. {{ISBN|0-226-11392-2}}, p. 29.</ref> Condivi recalls Michelangelo's saying that his sole regret in life was that he did not kiss the widow's face in the same manner that he had her hand.<ref name="A. Condivi p. 103"/>

===Feuds with other artists===
In a letter from late 1542, Michelangelo blamed the tensions between Julius&nbsp;II and himself on the envy of Bramante and [[Raphael]], saying of the latter, "all he had in art, he got from me". According to [[Gian Paolo Lomazzo]], Michelangelo and Raphael met once: the former was alone, while the latter was accompanied by several others. Michelangelo commented that he thought he had encountered the chief of police with such an assemblage, and Raphael replied that he thought he had met an executioner, as they are wont to walk alone.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Salmi |first1=Mario |author1-link=Mario Salmi|last2=Becherucci |first2=Luisa |last3=Marabottini |first3=Alessandro |last4=Tempesti |first4=Anna Forlani |last5=Marchini |first5=Giuseppe |last6=Becatti |author6-link=Giovanni Becatti |first6=Giovanni |last7=Castagnoli |first7=Ferdinando |author7-link=Ferdinando Castagnoli |last8=Golzio |first8=Vincenzo |title=The Complete Work of Raphael |year=1969 |publisher=Reynal and Co., [[William Morrow and Company]] |location=New York |pages=587, 610}}</ref>

==Works==
{{Main|List of works by Michelangelo}}

===Madonna and Child===
The ''Madonna of the Steps'' is Michelangelo's earliest known work in marble. It is carved in shallow relief, a technique often employed by the master-sculptor of the early 15th century, Donatello, and others such as [[Desiderio da Settignano]].<ref>Bartz and König, p. 8</ref> While the Madonna is in profile, the easiest aspect for a shallow relief, the child displays a twisting motion that was to become characteristic of Michelangelo's work. The ''[[Taddei Tondo]]'' of 1502 shows the Christ Child frightened by a [[Bullfinch]], a symbol of the Crucifixion.<ref name= "Goldscheider, p. 11"/> The lively form of the child was later adapted by Raphael in the ''[[Bridgewater Madonna]]''. The ''[[Bruges Madonna]]'' was, at the time of its creation, unlike other such statues depicting the Virgin proudly presenting her son. Here, the Christ Child, restrained by his mother's clasping hand, is about to step off into the world.<ref>Bartz and König, p. 22</ref> The ''[[Doni Tondo]]'', depicting the [[Holy Family]], has elements of all three previous works: the frieze of figures in the background has the appearance of a low-relief, while the circular shape and dynamic forms echo the Taddeo Tondo. The twisting motion present in the ''Bruges Madonna'' is accentuated in the painting. The painting heralds the forms, movement and colour that Michelangelo was to employ on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.<ref name="Goldscheider, p. 11"/>

===Male figure===
The kneeling angel is an early work, one of several that Michelangelo created as part of a large decorative scheme for the [[Arca di San Domenico]] in the church dedicated to that saint in Bologna. Several other artists had worked on the scheme, beginning with [[Nicola Pisano]] in the 13th century.  In the late 15th century, the project was managed by [[Niccolò dell'Arca]]. An angel holding a candlestick, by Niccolò, was already in place.<ref name=LG9>Goldscheider, p. 9</ref> Although the two angels form a pair, there is a great contrast between the two works, the one depicting a delicate child with flowing hair clothed in Gothic robes with deep folds, and Michelangelo's depicting a robust and muscular youth with eagle's wings, clad in a garment of Classical style.
Everything about Michelangelo's angel is dynamic.<ref>Hirst and Dunkerton, pp. 20–21</ref>
Michelangelo's ''[[Bacchus (Michelangelo)|Bacchus]]'' was a commission with a specified subject, the youthful [[Bacchus|God of Wine]].  The sculpture has all the traditional attributes, a vine wreath, a cup of wine and a fawn, but Michelangelo ingested an air of reality into the subject, depicting him with bleary eyes, a swollen bladder and a stance that suggests he is unsteady on his feet.<ref name=LG9/> While the work is plainly inspired by Classical sculpture, it is innovative for its rotating movement and strongly three-dimensional quality, which encourages the viewer to look at it from every angle.<ref>Bartz and König, pp. 26–27</ref>

In the so-called ''[[Dying Slave]]'', Michelangelo again utilised the figure with marked [[contraposto|contrapposto]] to suggest a particular human state, in this case waking from sleep.  With the ''[[Rebellious Slave]]'', it is one of two such earlier figures for the [[Tomb of Pope Julius II]], now in the Louvre, that the sculptor brought to an almost finished state.<ref>Bartz and König, pp. 62–63</ref> These two works were to have a profound influence on later sculpture, through [[Rodin]] who studied them at the [[Louvre]].<ref>Yvon Taillandier, ''Rodin'', New York: Crown Trade Paperbacks, (1977) {{ISBN|0-517-88378-3}}</ref>
The ''[[Atlas Slave]]'' is one of the later figures for Pope Julius' tomb.  The works, known collectively as ''The Captives'', each show the figure struggling to free itself, as if from the bonds of the rock in which it is lodged. The works give a unique insight into the sculptural methods that Michelangelo employed and his way of revealing what he perceived within the rock.<ref>Coughlan, pp. 166–67</ref>

===Sistine Chapel ceiling===
{{main|Sistine Chapel ceiling}}

The Sistine Chapel ceiling was painted between 1508 and 1512.<ref name="Bartz134"/> The ceiling is a flattened [[barrel vault]] supported on twelve triangular [[pendentive]]s that rise from between the windows of the chapel. The commission, as envisaged by [[Pope Julius II]], was to adorn the pendentives with figures of the twelve apostles.<ref>Goldscieder p. 12</ref> Michelangelo, who was reluctant to take the job, persuaded the Pope to give him a free hand in the composition.<ref name=PR402/> The resultant scheme of decoration awed his contemporaries and has inspired other artists ever since.<ref>Vasari, et al.</ref> The scheme is of nine panels illustrating episodes from the [[Book of Genesis]], set in an architectonic frame.  On the pendentives, Michelangelo replaced the proposed Apostles with Prophets and Sibyls who heralded the coming of the [[Messiah]].<ref name=PR402>Paoletti and Radke, pp. 402–03</ref>
[[File:CAPPELLA SISTINA Ceiling.jpg|thumb|upright=4.5|left|''The Sistine Chapel Ceiling'' (1508–1512)]]
{{clear}}
Michelangelo began painting with the later episodes in the narrative, the pictures including locational details and groups of figures, the ''Drunkenness of Noah''  being the first of this group.<ref name=PR402/> In the later compositions, painted after the initial scaffolding had been removed, Michelangelo made the figures larger.<ref name=PR402/> One of the central images, ''[[The Creation of Adam]]'' is one of the best known and most reproduced works in the history of art. The final panel, showing the ''[[Separation of Light from Darkness]]'' is the broadest in style and was painted in a single day.  As the model for the Creator, Michelangelo has depicted himself in the action of painting the ceiling.<ref name=PR402/>

As supporters to the smaller scenes, Michelangelo painted twenty youths who have variously been interpreted as angels, as muses, or simply as decoration. Michelangelo referred to them as "ignudi".<ref>Bartz and König</ref> The figure reproduced may be seen in context in the above image of the ''Separation of Light from Darkness''.
In the process of painting the ceiling, Michelangelo made studies for different figures, of which some, such as that for ''The Libyan Sibyl'' have survived, demonstrating the care taken by Michelangelo in details such as the hands and feet.<ref>Coughlan</ref> The Prophet [[Jeremiah]], contemplating the downfall of Jerusalem, is an image of the artist himself.

===Figure compositions===
Michelangelo's relief of the ''[[Battle of the Centaurs (Michelangelo)|Battle of the Centaurs]]'', created while he was still a youth associated with the Medici Academy,<ref>J. de Tolnay, ''The Youth of Michelangelo'', p. 18</ref> is an unusually complex relief in that it shows a great number of figures involved in a vigorous struggle.  Such a complex disarray of figures was rare in Florentine art, where it would usually only be found in images showing either the [[Massacre of the Innocents]] or the Torments of Hell. The relief treatment, in which some of the figures are boldly projecting, may indicate Michelangelo's familiarity with Roman [[sarcophagus]] reliefs from the collection of Lorenzo Medici, and similar marble panels created by [[Nicola Pisano|Nicola]] and [[Giovanni Pisano]], and with the figurative compositions on [[Ghiberti]]'s [[Florence Baptistery#Lorenzo Ghiberti|Baptistry Doors]].{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

The composition of the ''Battle of Cascina'' is known in its entirety only from copies,<ref>Goldscheider, p. 8</ref> as the original cartoon, according to Vasari, was so admired that it deteriorated and was eventually in pieces.<ref name=Vasari/> It reflects the earlier relief in the energy and diversity of the figures,<ref>J. de Tolnay, ''The Youth of Michelangelo'', p. 135</ref> with many different postures, and many being viewed from the back, as they turn towards the approaching enemy and prepare for battle.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

In ''The Last Judgment'' it is said that Michelangelo drew [[Artistic inspiration|inspiration]] from a fresco by [[Melozzo da Forlì]] in Rome's [[Santi Apostoli, Rome|Santi Apostoli]]. Melozzo had depicted figures from different angles, as if they were floating in the Heaven and seen from below. Melozzo's majestic figure of Christ, with windblown cloak, demonstrates a degree of foreshortening of the figure that had also been employed by [[Andrea Mantegna]], but was not usual in the frescos of Florentine painters. In ''The Last Judgment'' Michelangelo had the opportunity to depict, on an unprecedented scale, figures in the action of either rising heavenward or falling and being dragged down.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

In the two frescos of the Pauline Chapel, ''The Crucifixion of St. Peter'' and ''The Conversion of Saul'', Michelangelo has used the various groups of figures to convey a complex narrative. In the ''Crucifixion of Peter'' soldiers busy themselves about their assigned duty of digging a post hole and raising the cross while various people look on and discuss the events. A group of horrified women cluster in the foreground, while another group of Christians is led by a tall man to witness the events. In the right foreground, Michelangelo walks out of the painting with an expression of disillusionment.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

===Architecture===
Michelangelo's architectural commissions included a number that were not realised, notably the façade for Brunelleschi's Church of San Lorenzo in Florence, for which Michelangelo had a wooden model constructed, but which remains to this day unfinished rough brick. At the same church, Giulio de' Medici (later Pope Clement VII) commissioned him to design the Medici Chapel and the tombs of Giuliano and Lorenzo Medici.<ref>Goldscheider</ref> Pope Clement also commissioned the Laurentian Library, for which Michelangelo also designed the extraordinary vestibule with columns recessed into niches, and a staircase that appears to spill out of the library like a flow of lava, according to [[Nikolaus Pevsner]], "...&nbsp;revealing [[Mannerism]] in its most sublime architectural form."<ref>Nikolaus Pevsner, ''An Outline of European Architecture'', Pelican, 1964</ref>

In 1546 Michelangelo produced the highly complex ovoid design for the pavement of the [[Campidoglio]] and began designing an upper storey for the [[Farnese Palace]]. In 1547 he took on the job of completing St Peter's Basilica, begun to a design by Bramante, and with several intermediate designs by several architects. Michelangelo returned to Bramante's design, retaining the basic form and concepts by simplifying and strengthening the design to create a more dynamic and unified whole.<ref name="Gardner">Gardner</ref> Although the late 16th-century engraving depicts the dome as having a hemispherical profile, the dome of Michelangelo's model is somewhat ovoid and the final product, as completed by [[Giacomo della Porta]], is more so.<ref name="Gardner"/>

===Final years===
In his old age, Michelangelo created a number of ''Pietàs'' in which he apparently reflects upon mortality. They are heralded by the ''Victory'', perhaps created for the tomb of Pope Julius II but left unfinished. In this group, the youthful victor overcomes an older hooded figure, with the features of Michelangelo.

The ''Pietà of Vittoria Colonna'' is a chalk drawing of a type described as "presentation drawings", as they might be given as a gift by an artist, and were not necessarily studies towards a painted work. In this image, Mary's upraise arms and upraised hands are indicative of her prophetic role. The frontal aspect is reminiscent of [[Masaccio]]'s fresco of the [[Holy Trinity]] in the [[Basilica of Santa Maria Novella]], Florence.

In the ''Florentine Pietà'', Michelangelo again depicts himself, this time as the aged [[Nicodemus]] lowering the body of Jesus from the cross into the arms of Mary his mother and Mary Magdalene. Michelangelo smashed the left arm and leg of the figure of Jesus. His pupil [[Tiberio Calcagni]] repaired the arm and drilled a hole in which to fix a replacement leg which was not subsequently attached. He also worked on the figure of Mary Magdalene.<ref>Maiorino, Giancarlo, 1990. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Raf5I8SLQhQC&pg=PA28&dq= The Cornucopian Mind and the Baroque Unity of the Arts]''.

Oliver Press. p. 58. {{ISBN|1-934545-01-5}}.</ref>

The last sculpture that Michelangelo worked on (six days before his death), the ''[[Rondanini Pietà]]'' could never be completed because Michelangelo carved it away until there was insufficient stone. The legs and a detached arm remain from a previous stage of the work. As it remains, the sculpture has an abstract quality, in keeping with 20th-century concepts of sculpture.<ref>Tolnay, Charles de. 1960.

Firenze: Giunti. p. 117. {{ISBN|88-09-02274-2}}.</ref>

Michelangelo died in Rome in 1564, at the age of 88 (three weeks before his 89th birthday). His body was taken from Rome for interment at the [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence|Basilica of Santa Croce]], fulfilling the maestro's last request to be buried in his beloved [[Florence]].<ref>Coughlan, p. 179</ref>

Michelangelo's heir Lionardo Buonarroti commissioned [[Giorgio Vasari]] to design and build the ''Tomb of Michelangelo,'' a monumental project that cost 770 [[scudi]], and took over 14 years to complete.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|date=2017-10-12|title=Michelangelo's tomb: five fun facts you probably didn't know|url=https://www.theflorentine.net/2017/10/12/michelangelo-tomb-facts/|access-date=2021-05-20|website=The Florentine|language=en-US}}</ref> Marble for the tomb was supplied by [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I de' Medici]], Duke of Tuscany who had also organized a state funeral to honour Michelangelo in Florence.<ref name=":4" />

==Legacy==
[[File:Michelangelo's grave4.jpg|thumb|''Tomb of Michelangelo'' (1578) by [[Giorgio Vasari]] in the [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence]].]]

Michelangelo, with Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael, is one of the three giants of the Florentine [[High Renaissance]]. Although their names are often cited together, Michelangelo was younger than Leonardo by 23 years, and older than Raphael by eight.  Because of his reclusive nature, he had little to do with either artist and outlived both of them by more than forty years. Michelangelo took few sculpture students. He employed [[Francesco Granacci]], who was his fellow pupil at the Medici Academy, and became one of several assistants on the Sistine Chapel ceiling.<ref name=Goldscheider12/> Michelangelo appears to have used assistants mainly for the more manual tasks of preparing surfaces and grinding colours. Despite this, his works were to have a great influence on painters, sculptors and architects for many generations to come.

While Michelangelo's ''David'' is the most famous male nude of all time and now graces cities around the world, some of his other works have had perhaps even greater impact on the course of art. The twisting forms and tensions of the ''Victory'', the ''Bruges Madonna'' and the ''Medici Madonna'' make them the heralds of the [[Mannerism|Mannerist art]]. The unfinished giants for the tomb of Pope Julius II had profound effect on late-19th- and 20th-century sculptors such as [[Rodin]] and [[Henry Moore]].

Michelangelo's foyer of the Laurentian Library was one of the earliest buildings to utilise Classical forms in a plastic and expressive manner. This dynamic quality was later to find its major expression in Michelangelo's centrally planned St Peter's, with its [[giant order]], its rippling cornice and its upward-launching pointed dome.  The dome of St Peter's was to influence the building of churches for many centuries, including [[Sant'Andrea della Valle]] in Rome and [[St Paul's Cathedral]], London, as well as the civic domes of many public buildings and the state capitals across America.

Artists who were directly influenced by Michelangelo include Raphael, whose monumental treatment of the figure in the ''[[School of Athens]]'' and ''[[The Expulsion of Heliodorus from the Temple]]'' owes much to Michelangelo, and whose fresco of ''[[The Prophet Isaiah (Raphael)|Isaiah]]'' in Sant'Agostino closely imitates the older master's prophets.<ref>Ettlinger, Leopold David, and Helen S. Ettlinger. 1987. ''Raphael''. Oxford: Phaidon. pp. 91, 102, 122. {{ISBN|0-7148-2303-1}}.</ref> Other artists, such as [[Pontormo]], drew on the writhing forms of the ''Last Judgment'' and the frescoes of the Capella Paolina.<ref>Acidini Luchinat, Cristina. 2002. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=WFuhUtCOmhsC&pg=PA96&dq= The Medici, Michelangelo, and the Art of Late Renaissance Florence]''. New Haven: Yale University Press in association with the Detroit Institute of Arts. p. 96. {{ISBN|0-300-09495-7}}.</ref>

The Sistine Chapel ceiling was a work of unprecedented grandeur, both for its architectonic forms, to be imitated by many [[Baroque]] ceiling painters, and also for the wealth of its inventiveness in the study of figures. Vasari wrote:
{{quote|The work has proved a veritable beacon to our art, of inestimable benefit to all painters, restoring light to a world that for centuries had been plunged into darkness. Indeed, painters no longer need to seek for new inventions, novel attitudes, clothed figures, fresh ways of expression, different arrangements, or sublime subjects, for this work contains every perfection possible under those headings.<ref name=Vasari>[[Giorgio Vasari]], ''Lives of the Artists: Michelangelo''</ref>}}

==Footnotes==
{{refbegin}}
:a. {{note label|a|a|none}}Michelangelo's father marks the date as 6 March 1474 in the Florentine manner ''ab Incarnatione''. However, in the Roman manner, ''ab Nativitate'', it is 1475.
:b. {{note label|b|b|none}}Sources disagree as to how old Michelangelo was when he departed for school. De Tolnay writes that it was at ten years old while Sedgwick notes in her translation of Condivi that Michelangelo was seven.
:c. {{note label|c|c|none}}The [[Strozzi family]] acquired the sculpture ''Hercules''. [[Filippo Strozzi the Younger|Filippo Strozzi]] sold it to [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] in 1529. In 1594, [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] installed it in the Jardin d'Estang at [[Fontainebleau]] where it disappeared in 1713 when the Jardin d'Estange was destroyed.
:d. {{note label|d|d|none}}Vasari makes no mention of this episode and [[Paolo Giovio]]'s ''Life of Michelangelo'' indicates that Michelangelo tried to pass the statue off as an antique himself.
