'''Kate Seredy''' (November 10, 1899 – March 7, 1975) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-born writer and illustrator of children's books. She won the [[Newbery Medal]] once, the Newbery Honor twice, the [[Caldecott Honor]] once, and [[Lewis Carroll Shelf Award]].  Most of her books were written in English, which was not her first language.  Seredy seems to be unknown (and untranslated) in her native Hungary, despite the fact that her story of the Good Master, and the sequel set in World War I are intensely about Hungary.

== Life ==
Kate Seredy was born November 10, 1899{{efn|name=birth}} in Budapest, Hungary.<ref name=dlb>Cech, John, ''Dictionary of Literary Biographies'', Gale Research, 1983, Vol. 22.</ref>{{rp|299}} She was the only child of a schoolteacher, Louis Peter Seredy, and his wife, Anna Ireny. Seredy received a diploma to teach art from the [[Budapest Academy of Fine Arts|Academy of Arts in Budapest]]. During World War I Seredy traveled to Paris and worked as a combat nurse. After the war she illustrated several books in Hungary.<ref name=dlb />{{rp|300}}

In 1922 Seredy moved from Budapest to the United States. She studied English language, working as an illustrator and artist to support herself, while preparing to illustrate children's books. From 1933 to 1934 Seredy owned a children's bookstore. Though the store wasn't a success, she later credited it with helping her to understand children and what made a good children's book. In 1935 Seredy met [[May Massee]], the children's editor at Viking Press. Massee didn't have any illustration work for Seredy, but encouraged her to write about her childhood in Hungary, promising to publish the book for Christmas. After several months of work, Seredy submitted what would become ''[[The Good Master]]'', which she also illustrated. Though not auto-biographical, Seredy did spend her summers as a child on the plains of Hungary. She used many of her impressions and experiences in the story about young Kate, who is sent by her widowed father from Budapest to the country to live with her Uncle and his family.<ref name=dlb />{{rp|300}} ''The Good Master'' was named a Newbery Honor book in 1935, a runner-up to ''[[Caddie Woodlawn]]'', which Seredy illustrated for Simon and Schuster. In addition she designed the jacket and endpapers for ''[[Young Walter Scott]]'', which was another Newbery runner-up that year.<ref name=newbery>{{cite web|title=Newbery Awards|url=http://www.ala.org/alsc/awardsgrants/bookmedia/newberymedal/newberyhonors/newberymedal|accessdate=2012-05-15}}</ref>

In 1936 Seredy wrote and illustrated ''Listening'', set in rural New Jersey. That same year she purchased, "Listening Hill", a one-hundred acre farm near Montgomery, New York. It was here that she wrote ''[[The White Stag]]'', an historical retelling of legends of [[Huns]] settling Hungary. Seredy learned these stories from her father when she was a child.<ref name="newbery" /> This book, which she also illustrated, won the Newbery Award in 1938.<ref name=newbery /> In 1959 it received the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award.<ref>Creighton, Sean and Cunningham, Sheila, ''Literary Laurels: A Reader's Guide to Award-Winning Children's Books'', Hillyard, 1996, pp. 25–34</ref>

''[[The Singing Tree]]'' appeared in 1939. A sequel to ''The Good Master'', it tells of the effects of World War I on Kate and all of her family. The book shows the terrible effects of war upon ordinary people, especially those who are forced to leave their lands and homes to fight. ''The Singing Tree'' was also named a Newbery Honor book.<ref name=newbery /> Seredy continued to write and illustrate her own books as well as those of other writers. In 1945 she illustrated ''The Christmas Anna Angel'' by [[Ruth Sawyer]]. When the [[Caldecott Honor]] list was created in 1971, Seredy was retroactively named an Honor winner for those illustrations.<ref name=cald>{{cite web | title = Caldecott Awards | url = http://www.ala.org/alsc/awardsgrants/bookmedia/caldecottmedal/caldecotthonors/caldecottmedal#30s | accessdate =2012-05-20}}</ref>

Seredy had twelve children's books published, but she considered herself an illustrator before an author. She had a unique style, primarily based on drawing, and considered her books "an excuse for making pictures".<ref>[http://www.oklahoma.net/~silvrdal/seredy.html Kate Seredy as illustrator] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111182018/http://www.oklahoma.net/%7Esilvrdal/seredy.html |date=2007-11-11 }}</ref> Her last book, ''Lazy Tinka'', is dedicated to her long-time editor, May Massee.

Kate Seredy died March 7, 1975, in Middletown, New York, at the age of 75. Her papers and illustrations are held at the May Massee Collection at Emporia State University, Emporia, Kansas, and the University of Oregon Library.<ref name=20thC>Chevalier, Tracy (editor), ''Twentieth-Century Children's Writers'', St. James Press, 1989, pp. 870;</ref>
