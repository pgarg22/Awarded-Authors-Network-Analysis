'''Bernd Heinrich Wilhelm von Kleist''' (18 October 1777{{snd}}21 November 1811) was a German [[Poetry|poet]], [[Playwright|dramatist]], [[novelist]], [[short story]] writer and [[journalist]]. His best known works are the theatre plays ''[[Das Käthchen von Heilbronn]]'', ''[[The Broken Jug]]'', ''Amphitryon'' and ''[[Penthesilea (Kleist)|Penthesilea]]'', and the novellas ''[[Michael Kohlhaas]]'' and ''[[The Marquise of O]].'' Kleist died by suicide together with a close female friend who was terminally ill.

The [[Kleist Prize]], a prestigious prize for German literature, is named after him, as was the [[Kleist Theater]] in his birthplace [[Frankfurt (Oder)|Frankfurt an der Oder]].

== Life ==
Kleist was born into the [[von Kleist]] family in [[Frankfurt (Oder)|Frankfurt an der Oder]] in the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]], a province of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. After a scanty education, he entered the [[Prussian Army]] in 1792, served in the [[French Revolutionary Wars: Campaigns of 1796|Rhine campaign]] of 1796, and retired from the service in 1799 with the rank of lieutenant. He studied law and philosophy at the [[Viadrina European University|Viadrina University]], and in 1800, received a subordinate post in the Ministry of Finance at Berlin.

In the following year, Kleist's roving restless spirit got the better of him, and procuring a lengthened leave of absence, he visited Paris, then settled in Switzerland. There, he found congenial friends in [[Heinrich Zschokke]] and {{ill|Ludwig Wieland|de}} (1777–1819), son of the poet [[Christoph Martin Wieland]]; and to them, he read his first drama, a gloomy tragedy, ''{{ill|The Schroffenstein Family|de|3=Die Familie Schroffenstein}}'' (1803).

In the autumn of 1802, Kleist returned to Germany; he visited [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], and Wieland in [[Weimar]], stayed for a while in [[Leipzig]] and [[Dresden]], returned to Paris. Returning in 1804 to his post in Berlin, he transferred to the Domänenkammer (department for the administration of crown lands) at [[Königsberg]]. On a journey to Dresden in 1807, Kleist was arrested by the French as a spy; he remained a close prisoner of [[First French Empire|France]] in the [[Fort de Joux]]. On regaining his liberty, he proceeded to Dresden, where, in conjunction with [[Adam Müller|Adam Heinrich Müller]] (1779–1829), he published the journal ''[[Phöbus]]'' in 1808.

[[File:Kleist suicide letter.jpg|thumb|[[suicide note|Suicide letter]] addressed to his half-sister Ulrike]]
In 1809 Kleist went to [[Prague]], and ultimately settled in Berlin. He edited (1810/1811) the ''{{ill|Berliner Abendblätter|de}}''. Captivated by the intellectual and musical accomplishments of the terminally-ill Henriette Vogel<sup>([[:de:Henriette Vogel|de]])</sup>. Kleist, more disheartened and embittered than ever, agreed to do her bidding and die with her, carrying out this resolution by first shooting Vogel then himself on the shore of the Kleiner [[Wannsee]] (Little Wannsee) near [[Potsdam]], on 21 November 1811.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Kleist, Bernd Heinrich Wilhelm von|volume=15|pages=845-846}}</ref>

According to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]'', "Kleist's whole life was filled by a restless striving after ideal and illusory happiness, and this is reflected in his work. He was by far the most important North German dramatist of the [[German Romanticism|Romantic movement]], and no other of the Romanticists approaches him in the energy with which he expresses patriotic indignation."{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

=== A life with a plan ===
In the spring of 1799, the 21-year-old Kleist wrote a letter to his half-sister {{ill|Ulrike von Kleist|de|lt=Ulrike}} in which he found it "incomprehensible how a human being can live without a life plan" (''Lebensplan'').<ref name="MO">Heinrich von Kleist, ''The Marquise of O– and other stories.'' Ed. and translated by [[David Luke]] and Nigel Reeves. (New York: Penguin Books, 1978), 7.</ref> In effect, Kleist sought and discovered an overwhelming sense of security by looking to the future with a definitive plan for his life.<ref name="MO" /> It brought him happiness and assured him of confidence, especially knowing life without a plan only saw despair and discomfort.<ref name="MO" /> The [[irony]] of his [[suicide]] is the fodder of his critics.

===Relationship with Henriette Vogel and suicide pact===
Kleist met Henriette Vogel in 1809 through his friend Adam Müller; a friendship flourished. They shared a fondness for music, and according to Ernest Peguilhen, Henriette Vogel asked her friend to explain to her the art of war, as well as to teach her [[fencing]], for the dramatist was a soldier. The relationship between the two became intimate in the autumn of 1811. According to their contemporaries, there was no fire of passion but a purely spiritual love. That was the point of view of Adam Müller, who was romantically involved with Henriette for a while. His cousin<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/knowledgecentre/arts/modern-languages/kleist|title = Heinrich von Kleist, Education and Violence - Knowledge Centre}}</ref> [[Marie von Kleist]], the most important sponsor and confidant of Heinrich von Kleist, also made sure these rumors spread. (According to the autopsy report, she was suffering from [[cancer]].<ref>M. Riße & G. Weiler, "Heinrich von Kleist und Henriette Vogel. Forensisch-historische Aspekte eines erweiterten Suizids", ''Rechtsmedizin'' '''9''', 112–114 (1999) http://doi.org/10.1007/s001940050092</ref>)

On November 21, 1811, the two traveled from Berlin to Wannsee. Prior to their departure, they penned farewell letters, which along with an account of the final night they spent at the inn Gasthof Stimming, are part of world literature. Upon their arrival in the vicinity of the [[Wannsee]] in [[Potsdam]], Kleist shot Henriette, then turned the gun on himself. They were buried together in a common grave at Kleine Wannsee (Bismarckstrasse), which became a tourist attraction. It was re-designed prior to the bi-centenary of their deaths. On that occasion, direct access from Wannsee station to the grave was built. The gravestone, erected by Germans in 1936, was rotated, and shows engraved original text written by Max Ring and the Pater Noster's request: "forgive us our guilt" as well as the names and data of Henriette Vogel and Heinrich von Kleist.<ref>{{cite book| author=Tanja Langer |title=Wir sehn uns wieder in der Ewigkeit – Die letzte Nacht von Henriette Vogel und Heinrich von Kleist |location=München |publisher=dtv |year=2011 |isbn=978-3-423-13981-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Karin Reschke |title=Verfolgte des Glücks.

== Literary works ==
His first [[tragedy]] was ''The Schroffenstein Family'' (''Die Familie Schroffenstein''). The material for the second, ''[[Penthesilea (Kleist)|Penthesilea]]'' (1808), queen of the Amazons, is taken from a [[Penthesilea|Greek source]] and presents a picture of wild passion. More successful than either of these was his romantic play, ''Käthchen of Heilbronn'' (''Das Käthchen von Heilbronn'') (1808), a poetic drama full of medieval bustle and mystery, which retained its popularity for many years.<ref name=EB1911/>

In [[comedy]], Kleist made a name with ''[[The Broken Jug]]'' (''Der zerbrochne Krug'') (1808), while ''{{ill|Amphitryon (Kleist)|de|3=Amphitryon (Kleist)|lt=Amphitryon}}'' (1808), an adaptation of [[Molière]]'s comedy, received critical acclaim long after his death. Of Kleist's other dramas, ''[[Die Hermannsschlacht]]'' (1809) is a dramatic work of anti-[[Napoleon I|Napoleonic]] propaganda, written as [[War of the Fifth Coalition|Austria and France went to war]]. It has been described by [[Carl Schmitt]] as the "greatest [[wikt:partisan|partisan]] work of all time".<ref>Schmitt, Carl, ''The Theory of the Partisan'', page 5</ref> In it he gives vent to his hatred of his country's oppressors. This, together with the drama ''[[The Prince of Homburg (play)|The Prince of Homburg]]'' (''Prinz Friedrich von Homburg oder die Schlacht bei Fehrbellin''), which is among his best works, was first published by [[Ludwig Tieck]] in Kleist's ''Hinterlassene Schriften'' (1821). ''Robert Guiskard'', a drama conceived on a grand plan, was left a fragment.<ref name=EB1911 />

Kleist was also a master in the art of narrative, and of his ''Gesammelte Erzählungen'' (''Collected Short Stories'') (1810–1811), ''[[Michael Kohlhaas]]'', in which the famous [[Brandenburg]] horse dealer in [[Martin Luther]]'s day is immortalized, is one of the best German stories of its time.<ref name=EB1911 /> ''[[The Earthquake in Chile]]'' (''Das Erdbeben in Chili'') and ''[[St. Cecilia, or the Power of Music]]'' (''Die heilige Cäcilie oder die Gewalt der Musik'') are also fine examples of Kleist's story telling as is ''[[The Marquise of O]]'' (''Die Marquise von O''). His short narratives influenced those of [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]]<ref>Walter Hinderer, "Kleist bläst in mich, wie in eine alte Schweinsblase" in ''Franz Kafka und die Weltliteratur'', Ed. Manfred Engel, Dieter Lamping. (Göttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 2006) 66-82.</ref> and the novellas of the Austrian writer [[Friedrich Halm]].<ref>''Halms Werke'', Vol. 11, ed. by Faust Pachler and Emil Kuh; Carl Gerold's Sohn, Vienna, 1872, p. vii</ref> He also wrote patriotic lyrics in the context of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

===Work in rhetoric===
Kleist's work also delved into the realm of [[rhetoric]]. Most notable for his use of error and understanding its importance, Kleist's devices used were misspeaking, misunderstanding, mistaken identities, and other confusions of the sort. In his works one can see the most prevalent use of rhetoric within ''Penthesilea''. In the story moments of violence, seduction and war all hinge upon errors in language. Through these errors, Kleist shows how error can influence everyday situation and can be the causation of serious problems. As a sum, Kleist's use of error explores what one can make of ironic errors within speech.<ref>Sng, Zachary. ''The Rhetoric of Error from Locke to Kleist''. Stanford. Stanford University Press. 2010. Chapter 5.</ref>

== Philosophical essays ==
Kleist is also famous for his essays on subjects of [[aesthetics]] and psychology which, to the closer look, show a keen insight into the metaphysical questions discussed by philosophers of his time, such as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]].

=== ''On the Gradual Production of Thoughts Whilst Speaking'' ===
In the first of his larger essays, ''On the Gradual Production of Thoughts Whilst Speaking'' (''{{ill|Über die allmähliche Verfertigung der Gedanken beim Reden|de}}''), Kleist claims that most people are advised to speak only about what they already understand.<ref name="GbR405">Heinrich von Kleist, ''On the Gradual Production of Thoughts Whilst Speaking.'' Ed. and Trans. by David Constantine. (Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing, 2004), 405.</ref> Instead of talking about what you already know, Kleist admonishes his readers to speak to others with "the sensible intention of instructing yourself."<ref name="GbR405" /> Fostering a dialogue through the art of "skillful questioning" can play a role in achieving a rational or enlightened state of mind, but need not ("Nor is it that her skillful questioning leads me on to the point which matters, though this may frequently be the case" (von Kleist, p. 405)).<ref name="GbR405" /> And yet, Kleist employs the example of the French Revolution as the climactic event of the Enlightenment era whereby man broke free from his dark and feudal chains in favor of [[Liberté, égalité, fraternité|liberty, equality, fraternity]]. It is not that easy though for Kleist. Man cannot simply guide himself into the future with a rational mind as his primary tool. Therefore, Kleist strongly advocates for the usefulness of reflection ''[[wikt:ex post facto|ex post facto]]'' or after the fact.<ref name="GbR410">Heinrich von Kleist, ''On the Gradual Production of Thoughts Whilst Speaking.'' Ed. and Trans. by David Constantine. (Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing, 2004), 410.</ref> In doing so, man will be able to mold his collective [[consciousness]] in a manner conducive to the principles of [[free will]]. By reflecting after the fact, man will avoid the seemingly detestable inhibitions offered in rational thought. In other words, the [[will to power]] has "its splendid source in the feelings," and thus, man must overcome his "struggle with [[wiktionary:Fate|Fate]]" with a balanced mixture of [[wisdom]] and [[Passion (emotion)|passion]].<ref name="GbR410" />
