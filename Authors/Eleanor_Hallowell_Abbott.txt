==Early life==
Eleanor Hallowell Abbott was born on September 22, 1872, in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].<ref>Ehrlich, Eugene and Gorton Carruth. ''The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States''.

This resulted in her growing up knowing many famous literary people, like [[Longfellow, Henry Wadsworth|Longfellow]] and [[Robert Lowell|Lowell]].<ref name=":0">HAMBLEN, ABIGAIL ANN.

After attending private schools in Cambridge, she began courses at [[Radcliffe College]].<ref name="Who Was Who">{{cite book|title=Who Was Who Among North American Authors, 1921-1939|url=https://archive.org/details/whowaswhoamongno0001unse|url-access=registration|year=1976|publisher=Gale Research Co.|location=Detroit|isbn=0810310414|page=[https://archive.org/details/whowaswhoamongno0001unse/page/2 2]|chapter=Abbott, Eleanor Hallowell}}</ref> After completing her studies, she worked as a secretary and teacher at Lowell State Normal School.<ref name="UNH library">{{cite web|title=Eleanor Hallowell Abbott (1872-1958)|url=http://www.library.unh.edu/special/index.php/eleanor-hallowell-abbott|work=Library Special Collections|publisher=University of New Hampshire|access-date=September 8, 2012}}</ref> Here, she began to write poetry and short stories, but had little success in the beginning. It was only when ''Harper's Magazine'' accepted two of her poems that she saw promise in her work. This led to her winning three short-story prizes offered by ''[[Collier's]] ''and ''[[The Delineator]]''.<ref name=":0" />

==Later life and literary career==
In 1908 Abbott married Dr. Fordyce Coburn and relocated with him to [[Wilton, New Hampshire]].<ref>"Abbott, Eleanor Hallowell."

Retrieved August 13, 2012 from HighBeam Research: http://www.highbeam.com {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020331041952/http://highbeam.com/ |date=2002-03-31 }}</ref> Dr. Coburn was a medical advisor of the Lowell High School and would help his wife with her writing.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title = The Women Who Make Our Novels|last = Overton|first = Grant Martin|publisher = Moffat, Yard & Company|year = 1918|url = https://archive.org/details/womenwhomakeourn00overrich|page = [https://archive.org/details/womenwhomakeourn00overrich/page/331 331]|quote = eleanor hallowell abbott autobiography.}}</ref> Soon after moving, several widely read magazines accepted her work for publication. Two of her poems were accepted by [[Harperâ€™s Monthly]] Magazine in 1909. She went on to publish seventy-five [[short stories]] and fourteen [[romantic novel]]s. ''Being Little in Cambridge When Everyone Else Was Big'' is an autobiography written by Abbott about her childhood in Cambridge.<ref name=www.cambridgema.gov/>

Abbott tells of how when she was a child, she was a nervous and excitable one, and through her fiction, she got in touch with this side to her. This is shown greatly through her work's intensity of feeling. Her writing is one of romance and even though some of her characters go through tough and painful times, each of her novels and stories carries a happy conclusion. The principal characters she uses are young girls who exhibit audacious behavior, are high strung, terribly talkative and full of unsettling demands while their male counterparts are the opposite - quiet, strong and tough against patient suffering.<ref name=":0" />

Abbott gives a unique style and aims for spontaneity and originality. She writes with extreme vivacity and startling imagery. Abbott would not allow her work to be published unless she truly liked it herself. Her chief concern while writing was to use her own feeling about the story she was working on.<ref name=":1" /> Due to this unique style, many critics comment that even though her work is charming it can feel sometimes forced.<ref name=":0" /> In spite of this, Abbott's work reveals the turning away from the harshness of the [[New England]] surroundings that was in place at the time.

Abbott had no children. She died in 1958 in [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]].

The Eleanor Hallowell Abbott Papers are held by [[University of New Hampshire|The University of New Hampshire]] Library in the Milne Special Collections. The collection primarily consists of typescripts of Abbott's short stories.<ref name="UNH library" />
