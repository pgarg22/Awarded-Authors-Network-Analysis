<!--Basic introduction; name, dates, why he was notable-->

''' Sir Thomas Henry Hall Caine'''  {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|CH|KBE}} (14 May 1853 – 31 August 1931), usually known as '''Hall Caine''', was a British novelist, dramatist, short story writer, poet and critic of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Caine's popularity during his lifetime was unprecedented. He wrote fifteen novels on subjects of [[adultery]], divorce, [[domestic violence]], [[illegitimacy]], [[infanticide]], [[religious bigotry]] and [[women's rights]], became an international literary celebrity, and sold a total of ten million books. Caine was the most highly paid novelist of his day. ''The Eternal City'' is the first novel to have sold over a million copies worldwide.<ref name="Tetens 2015 6">{{Harvnb|Tetens|2015|p=6}}</ref> In addition to his books, Caine is the author of more than a dozen plays and was one of the most commercially successful dramatists of his time; many were [[West End theatre|West End]] and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] productions. Caine adapted seven of his novels for the stage. He collaborated with leading actors and managers, including [[Wilson Barrett]], [[Viola Allen]], [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]], [[Louis Napoleon Parker]], [[Mrs Patrick Campbell]], [[George Alexander (actor)|George Alexander]], and [[Arthur Collins (theatre manager)|Arthur Collins]]. Most of Caine's novels were adapted into [[Silent film|silent]] [[black and white]] films. [[A. E. Coleby]]'s 1923 18,454 feet, nineteen-reel film ''[[The Prodigal Son (1923 film)|The Prodigal Son]]'' became the longest commercially made [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British]] film.<ref>{{Harvnb| Robertson|1985|p=35}}</ref> [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s 1929 film ''[[The Manxman]]'', is Hitchcock's last silent film.

<!--Early life -->
Born in [[Runcorn]] to a [[Manx people|Manx]] father and [[Cumbrian]] mother, Caine was raised in [[Liverpool]]. After spending four years in school, Caine was trained as an architectural draughtsman. While growing up he spent childhood holidays with relatives in the [[Isle of Man]]. At seventeen he spent a year there as schoolmaster in [[Maughold]]. Afterwards he returned to Liverpool and began a career in journalism, becoming a leader-writer on the ''Liverpool Mercury''. As a lecturer and theatre critic he developed a circle of eminent literary friends by whom he was influenced. Caine moved to London at [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]'s suggestion and lived with the poet, acting as secretary and companion during the last years of Rossetti's life.  Following the publication of his ''Recollections of Rossetti'' in 1882 Caine began his career as a writer spanning four decades.

<!--Politics -->
Caine established his [[Residency (domicile)|residency]] in the Isle of Man in 1895, where he sat from 1901 to 1908 in the Manx [[House of Keys]], the lower house of its legislature. Caine was elected President of the Manx National Reform League in 1903 and chair of the Keys' Committee that prepared the 1907 petition for constitutional reform. In 1929
Caine was granted the Freedom of the Borough of [[Douglas, Isle of Man]]. Caine visited Russia in 1892 on behalf of the persecuted [[Jews]]. In 1895 Caine travelled in the United States and Canada, where he represented the [[Society of Authors]] conducting successful negotiations and obtaining important international copyright concessions from the Dominion Parliament.

<!--Reception and legacy-->
During the [[Great War]] (1914–1918) Caine wrote many patriotic articles and edited ''King Albert's Book'', the proceeds of which went to help Belgian refugees. In 1917, Caine was created an [[Order of Leopold (Belgium)|Officer of the Order of Leopold]] by [[King Albert I]] of Belgium. Caine cancelled many literary contracts in America to devote all his time and energy to the British war effort. On the recommendation of the Prime Minister [[Lloyd George]] for services as an Allied propagandist in the United States, [[King George V]] made him a [[Knight of the British Empire]] in 1918 and a [[Companion of Honour]] in 1922. Aged 78 Caine died in his home at [[Greeba Castle]] on the Isle of Man.

==Early life and influences==

===Early days===
[[File:Birthplace-of-Hall-Caine.jpg|thumbnail|Hall Caine's birthplace, 29 Bridgewater Street, Runcorn]]
Thomas Henry Hall Caine was born on 14 May 1853 at 29 Bridgewater Street, [[Runcorn]], [[Cheshire]], England,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Runcorn Urban District Council|title=Council meeting minutes|date=7 September 1931}}</ref><ref name=house group=nb/> the eldest of six children of John Caine (1825–1904) and his wife Sarah Caine (née Hall, (1828–1912)). Sarah was born in [[Whitehaven]], Cumberland, and descended from an old [[Quaker]] family of Ralph Halls, china manufacturer.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sunday Times Pert WA|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/57751027|date=16 February 1913}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Biographical Sketch|work=Shefield Weekly Telegraph|date=28 May 1887|page=5}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=WOTL.uk {{!}} Whitehaven Pottery – History, Cumbria|url=https://wotl.uk/whitehaven-pottery/|website=WOTL.uk|access-date=27 January 2018|date=20 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180127210124/https://wotl.uk/whitehaven-pottery/|archive-date=27 January 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> After living for many years in Cumberland the Hall family moved to Liverpool where Sarah, a seamstress, met and married John. As her husband was a member of the [[Anglican Church]] and not a Quaker she lost her connection with the [[Society of Friends]]. Throughout her life she retained the [[Testimony of simplicity|Quaker simplicity of life and dress]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Manx Quarterly, #12|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/57751027|date=June 1913}}</ref> John Caine, a [[blacksmith]], came from the [[Isle of Man]]. In the absence of work he emigrated to [[Liverpool]], where he trained as a [[Smith (metalwork)|shipsmith]]. At the time of Caine's birth, he was working temporarily in [[Port of Runcorn|Runcorn docks]]. Within a few months the family were back in [[Liverpool]], where Caine spent his childhood and youth. They rented rooms at 14 Rhyl Street, [[Toxteth]], convenient for [[Liverpool Docks]] and within a small [[Manx people|Manx]] expat community. By 1858 they had moved to number 21.  Early in 1862 they moved to 5 Brougham Street where Caine attended Windsor Street Wesleyan School, and in January 1865 the family moved round the corner to 2 Coburg Street.<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|pp=15–16}}</ref><ref name=Brougham group=nb/>

During his childhood Caine was occasionally sent to stay with his grandmother, Isabella, and uncle, William, a butcher-farmer, in their thatched cottage at [[Ballaugh]] on the [[Isle of Man]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|pp=3–29}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=16}}</ref> His grandmother nicknamed him 'Hommy-Beg', [[Manx language|Manx]] for 'Little Tommy'.<ref>{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|p=9}}</ref> The island has a long history of [[folklore]] and superstition, passed from generation to generation.<ref>{{Harvnb|Moore|1891|pp=1–18}}</ref> Continuing this tradition Grandmother Caine passed on her knowledge of local myths and legends to her grandson, telling him countless stories of fairies, witches, witch-doctors and the evil eye while they were sat by the fire.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1901|pp=21–22}}</ref>

When Caine was nine he lost two of his young sisters within a year. Five year old Sarah developed [[Hydrocephalus|hydrocephaly]] after a fever. Fourteen month old Emma died in [[convulsion]]s brought on by [[whooping cough]] she caught from him and his brother John. Caine was to be sent to the Isle of Man to recover from his illness and grief. He was put on a boat to [[Ramsey, Isle of Man|Ramsey]] by his father, with a label pinned on his coat and assurances that his uncle would meet him. A fierce storm occurred preventing the ferry from reaching land. Caine was rescued by a large rowing boat. He later drew on this experience when writing the scene in ''[[The Bondman (novel)|The Bondman]]'' in which Stephen Orry is cast ashore there.<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|pp=17–18}}</ref>

The Caine family belonged to the Baptist Church in Myrtle Street, Liverpool, presided over by the charismatic [[Hugh Stowell Brown]], a Manxman and brother of poet [[Thomas Edward Brown]]. Brown's public lectures and work among the poor made him a household name in Liverpool. Caine participated in the literary and debating society Brown had established. While Caine was very young he became well known and highly regarded by the people of south Liverpool. There he was in great demand as a speaker, having the ability to engage an audience from his first word.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1901|pp=26–27}}</ref> Through studying the works of the [[Lake Poets|Lake School of Poets]], and the best writers of the eighteenth century, Caine combined this knowledge with his own ideas of perfection, and went on to develop his level of eloquence to [[Public speaking|oratory]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1901|p=30}}</ref>

From the age of ten Caine was educated at Hope Street Unitarian Higher Grade School in Caledonia Street, Liverpool, becoming head boy in his last year there.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1901|p=22}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|pp=18–19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=D – K|url=http://www.liverpool-schools.co.uk/html/d_-_k.html|website=www.liverpool-schools.co.uk}}</ref> Prior to this he attended St. James's School and for several years afterwards continued his education attending evening classes at Queen's College, [[Liverpool Institute High School for Boys|Liverpool Institute]].<ref>{{cite news|title=The Author of The Christian |work= Liverpool Mercury|date=9 October 1899|page=9}}</ref> He spent many hours on his own avidly reading books, notably at [[Liverpool Central Library|Liverpool's Free Library]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=23}}</ref> Caine also experienced what he described as the 'scribbling itch' for writing. He produced essays, poems, novels and overview histories with little thought of them being published.<ref>{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|p=35}}</ref>

In common with all 19th century towns Liverpool was unsanitary. In 1832 there had been a cholera epidemic. As panic and fear of this new and misunderstood disease spread, eight major riots had broken out on the streets along with several smaller uprisings.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Burrell|first1=Sean|last2=Gill|first2=Geoffrey|title=The Liverpool Cholera Epidemic of 1832 and Anatomical Dissection—Medical Mistrust and Civil Unrest|journal=Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences|date=1 October 2005|volume=60|issue=4|pages=478–498|doi=10.1093/jhmas/jri061|pmid=16144959|language=en|issn=0022-5045}}</ref> In 1849 a second epidemic occurred.<ref>{{cite news|title=A walk through the Cholera Districts of Liverpool|url=http://www.old-merseytimes.co.uk/Cholera.html|work=old-merseytimes.co.uk|publisher=Liverpool Journal|date=24 November 1849}}</ref> When Caine was thirteen the third outbreak of cholera occurred in July 1866.<ref>{{cite news|title=The cholera and the burial of cholera victims, 1866|url=http://www.old-merseytimes.co.uk/choleraburial1866.html|via=www.old-merseytimes.co.uk|work=Liverpool Mercury|date=20 August 1866}}</ref> Memories of that time were to stay with him, the deaths, the large volume of funerals and prayer meetings in open spaces that were happening all around him.<ref name="Allen 1997 26">{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=26}}</ref>

===Apprentice and schoolmaster===
At fifteen, after leaving school, he was apprenticed to John Murray, an architect and [[Surveying|surveyor]] in Lord Street, Liverpool.<ref name="Kenyon 1905 27">{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1901|p=27}}</ref> Murray was a distant relative of [[William Ewart Gladstone]].<ref name="Kenyon 1905 27"/> On 10 December [[1868 United Kingdom general election|1868, the day of the general election]] when Gladstone was to be elected as Prime Minister, Caine was running to offices in Union Court, belonging to Gladstone's brother, with telegrams announcing the results of the contests all over the country. Caine was breaking the news of great majorities before Gladstone had time to open his telegrams.<ref>{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|p=33}}</ref> Caine was to meet Gladstone on another occasion when he was on Gladstone's estate at [[Seaforth House]]. The surveyor-in-chief had not appeared one morning and a fifteen year old Caine took his place.<ref>{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|p=34}}</ref> Caine had left a lasting impression on Gladstone, as two years later Caine had a letter from Gladstone's brother saying the Prime Minister wished to appoint him steward of the Lancashire Gladstone estates. Caine declined the offer.<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=22}}</ref>

Caine's maternal grandparents had lived with the rest of his family while they were growing up in Liverpool. His grandfather, Ralph Hall, died in January 1870, when Caine was seventeen.  In the same year of his life Caine was reunited with William Tirebuck, a friend from his school days, when the business of their masters brought them together. United in their interest in literature, they made a juvenile attempt to establish a monthly manuscript magazine, assisted by Tirebuck's sister. Tirebuck was editor, printer, publisher and postman; Caine was principal author.  One of the magazine's contributors inherited a small fortune which he invested. About ten thousand copies were printed, followed by a delayed issue no.2. After this venture Tirebuck returned to his position as junior clerk in a merchant's office.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tirebuck|1903|pp=x – xiii}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|pp=36–38}}</ref>

[[File:Ramsey St. Maughold Church Isle of Man England.jpg|thumb|left|The centre of Maughold Village, Isle of Man]]

Suffering from what he described as "the first hint of one of the nervous attacks which even then beset me", and later as "the first serious manifestation of the nervous attacks which have pursued me through my life",<ref>{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|pp=38}}</ref> Caine quit his job with Murray and, arriving unannounced, went to live with his uncle and aunt, James and Catherine Teare in [[Maughold (parish)|Maughold]] on the Isle of Man.

Teare was the local [[schoolmaster]], and as Caine was to learn, ill with tuberculosis.  Caine became his assistant teaching in the schoolhouse. Finding their accommodation in part of the schoolhouse was crowded Caine camped in a nearby ''tholtan'', a half-ruined cottage.  Using his stonemason skills, taught to him by his grandfather Hall, he restored and lived in the cottage.  On the stone lintel above the door he carved the name Phoenix Cottage and the date 8 January 1871.<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=21}}</ref><ref name="Caine 1908 38–39">{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|pp=38–39}}</ref>

Encouraged by Teare, after he had written to reassure Caine's parents that he might one day be able to make a living as a writer, Caine wrote anonymous articles for a local newspaper on a wide range of religious and economic questions.<ref name="Caine 1908 38–39"/>

[[John Ruskin]] had started his [[Guild of St George]] and began expressing his ideas in his new monthly series, ''[[Fors Clavigera]]'', written as a result of his feelings regarding the acute poverty and misery in Great Britain at the time. Rumours of undergraduates, following Ruskin's ideas, digging the ground outside [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], reached Caine. He was inspired by Ruskin to begin writing denunciations of the [[social system]] and of the accepted interpretation of the [[Western Christianity|Christian faith]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|p=39}}</ref> Caine was to become 'an eager pupil and admirer' of Ruskin.<ref name="Allen 1997 26"/> He later became a frequent visitor to Ruskin's [[Coniston, Cumbria|Coniston]] home, [[Brantwood]].

Following the death of James Teare in December 1871, Caine carved a headstone for the grave.  After officially taking his place as schoolmaster, he also performed the extra unpaid services his uncle had provided, "such as the making of wills for farmers round about, the drafting of agreement and leases, the writing of messages to banks protesting against crushing interest, and occasionally the inditing of love letters for young farm hands to their girls in service on farms that were far away". Later he drew on this material to use in his writing.<ref>{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|p=40}}</ref>
In March 1872, he had a letter from Murray his master, the architect, which said "Why are you wasting your life over there? Come back to your proper work at once." Caine was on his way back to Liverpool within a week.<ref>{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|p=43}}</ref><ref name="Allen 1997 29">{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=29}}</ref>

===Journalist and theatre critic===
In April 1872, at the age of eighteen, Caine was back home in Liverpool where he set about applying his knowledge, gained working in the drawing office, into articles on architectural subjects, and subsequently published in ''[[The Builder]]'' and ''[[The Building News]]''. These were Caine's first works published for a national audience. The articles caught Ruskin's attention and he wrote words of encouragement to Caine.<ref>{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|pp=44–46}}</ref>

Seeking to be published, he offered his services, without payment, as a theatre critic to a number of Liverpool newspapers, which were accepted. He used the pseudonym 'Julian'.<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=43}}</ref> Before Henry Irving played Hamlet, his intention to play the part differently to any other actor was known to Caine and he contributed many articles on the subject to various papers.<ref name="Kenyon 1905 34">{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1901|p=34}}</ref> The study of Shakespeare and the Bible from his earliest years were his 'chief mental food'.<ref name="Kenyon 1905 36">{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1901|p=36}}</ref> As he had become more absorbed by literary studies he was not content with reading Shakespeare's plays, so he was reading all of the most notable playwrights of the Elizabethan age and "he began to make acquaintance with the dramatists".<ref name="Kenyon 1905 36"/> In the summer of 1872 Caine wrote his first play.  ''The Charter'' was an adaptation of [[Charles Kingsley]]'s novel ''[[Alton Locke]]'', but as an unknown writer he could not get it staged.<ref>{{Harvnb| Waller |2006|p=753}}</ref>  "Partly from the failure of faith in myself as a draughtsman and partly from a desire to be moving on"<ref>{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|p=48}}</ref> Caine left his employment with Murray and joined the office of [[Richard Owens (architect)|Richard Owen]] and later Wainwright and Son. For a few years he was general assistant to a builder, James Bromley who became his friend.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Christian|work=Liverpool Mercury|date=9 October 1899|page=9}}</ref>

Together with William Tirebuck and George Rose, his friends from school days,<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=31}}</ref> Caine applied himself to establishing Liverpool branches of the Shakespeare Society, and the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|p=50}}</ref> They called their own organisation Notes and Queries Society and held their meetings at the prominent [[Liverpool Royal Institution|Royal Institution]], Colquitt Street. Caine was president of the society and their meetings were reported in the Liverpool newspapers.<ref>{{cite news|title=Local News|work=Liverpool Mercury|date=5 February 1879}}</ref> The 'Notes' were often provided by [[John Ruskin]], [[William Morris]] and [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Tirebuck|1903|p=xv}}</ref>

On 16 October 1874 [[Henry Irving]] wrote to Caine agreeing to his request to use his portrait in ''Stray Leaves'' a new monthly magazine he was launching.<ref name="Stoker 1906 115">{{Harvnb|Stoker|1906|p=115}}</ref><ref name="Kenyon 1905 44">{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1901|p=44}}</ref> In his capacity as critic of the Liverpool ''Town Crier'', Caine attended the first night of ''[[Hamlet]]'' at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London]], on 31 October 1874, with Irving in the title role. Caine was enthralled by Irving's performance and after his enthusiastic review was published in the newspaper, he was asked to reprint it as a broad-sheet pamphlet, as it was of such a high quality.<ref name="Stoker 1906 115"/>

Caine's first short story ''Max Wieland'' was published in the ''Liverpool Critic'' around 1874. A year later Caine became dramatic critic of the ''Spectator''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Day to Day in Liverpool|newspaper=Liverpool Daily Post|date=14 May 1918|page=3}}</ref> Caine's long narrative poem, ''Geraldine'', appeared in print in March 1876. It was a completion of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge's]] unfinished poem ''[[Christabel (poem)|Christabel]]''.<ref name="Kenyon 1905 44"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=44}}</ref>

The Caine family had moved into a larger house in 1873, at 59 South Chester Street, [[Toxteth]], where Caine shared a bedroom with his younger brother John, a shipping clerk.<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=32}}</ref> John contracted [[tuberculosis]] which he passed to his brother. By 1875 Caine had permanent lodgings in [[New Brighton, Merseyside|New Brighton]], spending weekends there "for the sake of his health".<ref>{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1901|p=52}}</ref> Caine became increasingly unwell from the beginning of January 1877. In April the same year John, died from [[tuberculosis]], aged 21. Dangerously ill, Caine was terrified of suffering the same fate.<ref name="Allen 1997 55">{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=55}}</ref> He recovered, but the disease left him with permanent lung damage, and throughout his life he had attacks of [[bronchitis]]. In his 1913 novel ''[[The Woman Thou Gavest Me (novel)|The Woman Thou Gavest Me]]'', he describes Mary O’Neil dying of tuberculosis.<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=353}}</ref>

[[File:The shadow of a crime by Hall Caine.jpg|thumb|right|1895 Poster advertising ''The Shadow of a Crime''.]]
[[Manchester City Council|Manchester Corporation]] had covertly been buying land for building the proposed [[Thirlmere Aqueduct]], intended to supply water to the city. When discovered, it outraged the local community. [[Thirlmere]], close to the centre of the Lake District, in an area, not only celebrated in the poetry of early conservationist [[William Wordsworth]] and fellow Lake poets, but also used as a summer residence by writers, amongst others.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ritvo|2009|pp=12, 102}}</ref> In opposition to damming the lake at [[Thirlmere]] to form a reservoir, the first environmental group, Thirlmere Defence Association was formed in 1877.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ritvo|2009|pp=1–6}}</ref> It was supported by the national press, Wordsworth's son and John Ruskin. Caine, incensed at what he perceived as a threat to his beloved Cumbria, joined the movement, initiating a Parliamentary petition.<ref name="Allen 1997 62">{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=62}}</ref> Thirlmere was to be the setting for his novel ''The Shadow of a Crime''.<ref name="Allen 1997 62"/>

In response to his lecture ''The Supernatural in Shakespeare'',<ref>{{cite news|title=Notes and Queries. Professor Dowden on the study of Shakespere|work=Liverpool Mercury|date=10 July 1878|page=8}}</ref> given in July 1878, in a meeting chaired by [[Edward Dowden|Professor Edward Dowden]], [[Matthew Arnold]] wrote him a long letter of praise. He was also praised by [[John Keats|Keats]]'s biographer, [[Richard Monckton Milnes, 1st Baron Houghton|Lord Houghton]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1901|p=58}}</ref> The lecture appeared in ''Colburn's New Monthly Magazine'' in August 1879,<ref>{{cite news|title=The Magazines For September|work=Liverpool Mercury|date=3 September 1879|page=6}}</ref>

Irving presided at a meeting of the Liverpool Notes and Queries Society in September 1878.  At Irving's invitation, he travelled to London to attend Irving's first night at the Lyceum Theatre under his own management, presenting his new production of ''Hamlet'' with [[Ellen Terry]] as ''[[Ophelia]]'' on 30 December. It was at this time that Caine was introduced to Irving's business manager, [[Bram Stoker]], who was to become one of his closest friends.<ref>{{Harvnb|Foulkes|2008|p=55}}</ref> Stoker was subsequently to dedicate his famous novel ''[[Dracula]]'' to Caine, under the [[nickname]] 'Hommy-Beg'.

In 1879 Caine edited a booklet of the papers presented to the Notes and Queries Society by [[William Morris]], [[Samuel Huggins]] and [[J. J. Stevenson|John J. Stevenson]] on the progress of public and professional thought on the treatment of ancient buildings which was described as "'well worth reading".<ref>{{cite news|title=Literary Notices|work=Liverpool Mercury|date=22 February 1879}}</ref><ref>The Restoration of Ancient Buildings.

He spoke of the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]], its purpose, actions and achievements.<ref>{{cite news|title=Social Science Congress|work=Liverpool Mercury|date=7 October 1879|page=7}}</ref> Caine had joined the society the previous year and remained a member for the rest of his life. One of the society's founders was [[William Morris]].

===Friendship with Francis Tumblety===
As a young man of 21 Caine encountered the self-proclaimed 'Great American Doctor', [[Francis Tumblety]], aged 43, after he set up at 177 Duke Street, Liverpool, offering herbal cure-all [[elixir]]s and [[Patent medicine]]s to the public, which he claimed were secrets of the [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]].  Tumblety posed at various times in his life as a surgeon, an officer in the federal army, and a gentleman.<ref>{{Harvnb| Curtis Jr.|2001|p=29}}</ref>{{incomplete short citation|date=July 2021}} He always followed his name with "M.D." and used the title 'Doctor', without the supporting qualifications for which he was fined in [[Saint John, New Brunswick]] in 1860.<ref>{{Harvnb| Storey |2012|p=93}}</ref>

From September 1874, Tumblety was announcing his arrival in Liverpool by advertising in local newspapers, later including testimonials.<ref>{{Harvnb| Storey |2012|pp=111–112}}</ref> Following the death of Edward Hanratty in January 1875, the same night he took a spoon of medicine supplied by Tumblety, and action taken by William Carroll to sue Tumblety for £200 after allegedly publishing a false testimonial, Tumblety fled to London.<ref>{{Harvnb| Storey |2012|pp=113–114}}</ref> Many newspapers reported the stories and in the wake of this adverse publicity, Tumblety recruited Caine to edit his biography.

His response was to tell Caine to stop until he saw the proofs.  Tumblety offered to pay for Caine to visit him in London to discuss the pamphlet, his letter dated 16 February indicating Caine had taken up the offer.<ref>{{Harvnb| Riordan |2009|p=149}}</ref> He told a friend that his visit to Tumblety was "arduous".<ref name="Allen 1997 29"/> A spate of correspondence relating to the publication ensued, Tumblety supplying Caine with names of notable people to be included in the pamphlet, along with money for printing and advertising.  Tumblety later wrote of disputes with the printer.  Claiming to be too ill to send money, he sent Caine a printer's bill for payment. Tumblety had hired an assistant who read the proofs to him.  The pamphlet entitled ''Passages from the Life of Dr Francis Tumblety'', and the fourth of Tumblety's biographies, was published in March 1875.<ref name="Storey 2012 116"/>

Tumblety wrote to Caine in April 1875 that he was contemplating manufacturing his pills in London, and required a partner to share the profits, telling Caine to approach Liverpool chemists as proposed outlets.<ref>{{Harvnb| Storey |2012|p=118}}</ref> Caine had declined a further invitation to London, but Tumblety persisted with his invites to join him in London, later made by telegram, additionally inviting him on a planned trip to [[America]].<ref>{{Harvnb| Riordan |2009|p=150}}</ref> Around the time Alfred Thomas Heap was hanged in [[Kirkdale, Liverpool|Kirkdale Gaol, Liverpool]], for an abortion-related death, Tumblety, who had been arrested in 1857 for selling abortion drugs, disappeared.

===Rossetti years===
Caine delivered a series of three lectures on [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]'s work and the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] movement at [[Liverpool Central Library|Liverpool Library]] between November 1878 and March 1879. The January lecture entitled ''The Poetry of Dante Rossetti'' was printed in Colburn's ''New Monthly Magazine'' in July 1879. Caine sent a copy of the magazine to the poet Rossetti, who by that time had become a virtual recluse and was "ravaged by years of addiction to chloral and too much whisky".<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|pp=69–71}}</ref>

[[File:Hall Caine and Rossetti.png|thumb|Dante Gabriel Rossetti walking to and fro while Hall Caine reads his lectures out loud during their stay in a farmhouse at St John's in the Vale, Cumbria.]]
Rossetti wrote his first letter to Caine on 29 July 1879. This letter was the first of nearly two hundred in quick succession.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1901|pp=59–62}}</ref> 
Around this time Caine's father was badly injured in an accident at work and Caine took responsibility for supporting his parents and siblings.<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=103}}</ref> Early in 1880 he wrote ''Stones Crying Out'', a short book on the restoration of old buildings. Two of the chapters were papers he had read at the [[Social Science Congress]] and Liverpool Library.<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|2000|pp=25, 36, 110}}</ref> Rossetti introduced Caine to [[Ford Madox Brown]], who was at the time working on ''[[The Manchester Murals]]''. Following his visit to write an article on Brown's frescoes in July 1880 they became friends. On a later visit Caine accepted Brown's invitation to sit for one of the figures while he was working on ''The Expulsion of the Danes from Manchester'', the third fresco.<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|pp=88, 105;}}</ref> On another visit he modelled for ''Crabtree watching the Transit of Venus A.D. 1639'', the fifth fresco to be painted.<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=152}}</ref> Caine and Rossetti eventually met in September 1880 when Caine visited Rossetti in his home at 16 [[Cheyne Walk]], [[Chelsea, London]], where he lived "in shabby splendour".<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=91}}</ref>

The strain of overworking was affecting Caine's health and in 1881, deciding to focus on his literary career, he left his job at Bromley & Son and went to [[St John's in the Vale]], Cumbria.<ref>{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|p=148}}</ref> Before long Rossetti wrote that he too was ill and asked Caine to go to London planning to return to Cumbria with him. By the time Caine arrived in London Rossetti had changed his mind and instead Caine became Rossetti's housemate.<ref>{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|p=150}}</ref> Early in September, persuaded by friends and family Rossetti spent a month with Caine at St John's in the Vale, accompanied by [[Fanny Cornforth]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Waugh|2011|p=228}}</ref> Whilst there, Caine recited a local myth to Rossetti. The myth was to become the inspiration for his first novel ''The Shadow of a Crime''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|pp=176–177}}</ref> He was also delivering weekly lectures in Liverpool.<ref>{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|pp=173, 190}}</ref>

==Start of literary career==
[[File:Hall Caine Vanity Fair 2 July 1896.jpg|thumb|{{center|''The Manxman''<br/>Caine as caricatured in ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', July 1896}}]]
From 1882 Caine was employed as a leader-writer on the ''Liverpool Mercury'' and was given free rein as to the subject and number of articles he wrote.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1901|p=82}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|p=252}}</ref> This gave him the opportunity to attend and review numerous first nights at the London theatres.<ref name="Kenyon 1905 34"/> One review angered actor-playwright [[Wilson Barrett]] and he demanded a meeting with Caine.<ref>{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|p=255}}</ref> Barrett concluding his complaint added "I think you could write a play, and if someday you should hit on a subject suitable to me, I shall be glad if you will let me hear of it".<ref>{{Harvnb|Tetens|2015|p=37}}</ref>

Caine's ''Cobwebs of Criticism:  A Review of the First Reviewers of the Lake, Satanic and Cockney Schools'' was published in 1883. It began as a series of Liverpool lectures exposing unjustified reviews of poets [[Lord Byron|Byron]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], [[Leigh Hunt|Hunt]], [[John Keats|Keats]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]], [[Robert Southey|Southey]] and [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] that were written during their lifetimes<ref>{{Harvnb|Waller|2006|p=133}}</ref>

[[File:Mary Hall Caine.jpg|thumb|left|Mary Hall Caine by Alfred Ellis]]
[[File:Portrait of Hall Caine.jpg|thumb|left|Hall Caine, by H. S. Mendelssohn]]
Returning to London after Rossetti's death, Caine moved into 18 [[Inns of Chancery|Clement's Inn]] in July 1882, sharing rooms with his academic friend [[Eric Sutherland Robertson|Eric Robertson]], where they often hosted intellectual gatherings.<ref name="Allen 1997 153">{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=153}}</ref> They frequently had their evening meals delivered from a nearby coffee shop in [[Clare Market]], which were brought by two young women; one was the 19-year-old Mary Chandler who was to eventually marry Caine.<ref name=Chandler group=nb/>
Mary was the fourth of seven children. She was born 23 April 1863, the daughter of Mary and William Chandler, a General Dealer, and grew up in [[Bethnal Green]]. William died in 1873 and her mother married John Ward, a Poulterer, in [[Shoreditch]]. The family moved to the [[City of London]] where John became a Hawker.<ref>{{cite web |title=London, England, Church of England Births and Baptisms, 1813–1906 |url=https://www.ancestry.com/interactive/1558/31280_197484-00192 |website=www.ancestry.com |access-date=17 March 2019}}</ref>
Months after Mary had first met Caine, John Ward and the other girl's father confronted Caine and Robertson demanding marriage, claiming the young women had been 'ruined'. According to Caine's biographer, nothing more than 'a bit of flirting' had taken place.<ref name="Allen 1997 153"/> Refusing to marry, Caine went to Liverpool to deliver lectures, returning to London in early December 1882.<ref name="Allen 1997 155">{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=155}}</ref> Upon Caine's return Mary's stepfather abandoned her at Clement's Inn. Mary went to [[Sevenoaks]] for six months to be educated, financed by Caine; she had received little education as a child.<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|pp=159–160}}</ref>

At the end of October 1883, with enough money to last about four months Caine, accompanied by Mary, went to the [[Isle of Wight]] where he rented Vectis Cottage, close to the cliffs and sea near [[Sandown]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1901|pp=82–83}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=168}}</ref> There he set to work writing his first novel ''The Shadow of a Crime''.

Living in rooms on the fourth floor of New Court, in [[Lincoln's Inn]], he re-wrote it.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1901|p=88}}</ref> After running as a serial in the ''Liverpool Weekly Mercury'', Caine's novel was published in February 1885, by [[Chatto & Windus]], and serialised in several newspapers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|pp=174–175}}</ref> His reputation was immediately established, along with a foremost place among the novelists of the day.<ref>{{cite news|title=Illustrated London News|date=2 April 1887|page=28}}</ref> He was later invited to write the story of writing ''The Shadow of a Crime'', which after its appearance in ''the Idler'' was published in 1894 in ''My First Book''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1901|p=83}}</ref> After the publication of Caine's first novel, Mary created a series of scrapbooks containing items relating to his public life.<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=176}} Now held in the Manx Museum, [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]]</ref>

Mary and Caine's son, [[Gordon Hall Caine|Ralph Hall]], was born in their rented house Yarra, Worseley Road, [[Hampstead]] on 15 August 1884.<ref name=Chandler group=nb/> The following month they moved to live in Aberleigh Lodge, Red House Lane, [[Bexleyheath]], next door to William Morris' [[Red House (London)|Red House]], where they remained until 1889.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Globe|date=23 November 1889|page=6}}</ref>

Caine had many friends in London's elite artistic and intellectual circles.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tetens|2015|p=36}}</ref> As a friend of Stoker and Irving for many years he became a regular at Irving's [[Beefsteak Club|Beefsteak Room]] gatherings at the Lyceum, presided over by [[Ellen Terry]], where he became acquainted with the [[Edward VII|Prince of Wales (later Edward VII)]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=164}}</ref> At one supper, where the only other guest was composer [[Alexander Mackenzie (composer)|Alexander Mackenzie]], Caine breaking the rules, brought his son Ralph with him.<ref>{{Harvnb| Storey |2012|pp=143–144}}</ref>

In order to make essential money and acquire exposure in America, disregarding the advice of his friends, Caine's short novel ''[[She's All The World To Me]]'', was published in New York, in 1885 by [[Harper & Brothers]]. ''[[She's All The World To Me]]'' was the first of his novels to be set on the Isle of Man. Under [[American copyright law]]s the book's copyright was forfeited to Harper and Brothers, a situation unforeseen by Caine, he was incensed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|pp=165, 178}}</ref> Caine recycled much of the material from the book in his later works, particularly in ''The Deemster''. ''She's All The World To Me'' was serialised in the ''Liverpool Weekly Mercury'' between 21 March and 4 April 1885 immediately following ''The Shadow of a Crime''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Liverpool Mercury|date=16 March 1885|page=1}}</ref>

Set in the contrasting locations of the Vale of Newlands in the Lake District and [[Victorian London]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1901|p=93}}</ref> ''A Son of Hagar'', Caine's third novel was written in 1885–86 and published in 1886 by Chatto and Windus.<ref name="Caine 1905 vi">{{Harvnb|Caine|1905|p=vi}} Bram Stoker Introduction to Hall Caine, Son of Hagar</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1901|p=92}}</ref> Begun in collaboration with [[Robert Williams Buchanan|Robert Buchanan]], their partnership was discontinued early on after discovering they did not work well together.<ref name="Caine 1905 vi"/> Dealing with the theme of [[illegitimacy in fiction|illegitimacy]], Caine has written a story close to his own life.<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=181}}</ref> The opening scene is set in Victorian London police court where a girl is charged with attempted suicide after she and her illegitimate baby had been dragged from the Thames, a scene he could well have witnessed while working as reporter.<ref>{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|pp=259–261}}</ref> Later Caine attempted to suppress ''A Son of Hagar'' from both of the Collected Editions of his novels. Licensed to Thomas Nelson in 1907 by Chatto, the novel was printed in the ''Nelson Library''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=178}}</ref>

In 1886 Mary and Caine travelled to Scotland to watch Irving when he was on tour in Edinburgh where they covertly married on 3 September under Scottish law by declaration before witnesses.<ref name=Chandler group=nb/> Mary became a devoted wife, reading all his work, advising and criticising when appropriate and was his first secretary.<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=184,205}}</ref>

Two of Caine's sonnets, ''Where Lies the Land!'' and ''After Sunset'', were included in [[William Sharp (writer)|William Sharp]]'s 1886 anthology ''Sonnets of this Century''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sharp|first1=William|title=Sonnets of this century|url=https://archive.org/details/sonnetsthiscent01shargoog|publisher=London, W.

It ran to more than fifty English editions and was translated into every major European language.<ref name="Allen 1997 55"/> Caine sent a copy of the novel to [[Wilson Barrett]] as he suited the main character, then set to work adapting his novel into a stage version called Ben-my-Chree, Manx for 'Girl of my Heart'.<ref name="Kenyon 1905 120"/> Irving, after reading the book, saw potential in it, himself playing the Bishop.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tetens|2015|p=48}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|pp=348–349}}</ref> The play opened at the Princess Theatre on 17 May 1888 and ran for a profitable nine weeks.<ref name="Tetens 2015 47">{{Harvnb|Tetens|2015|p=47}}</ref> It was a popular staple on Barratt's provincial and international tours for several years afterwards and was successfully produced by others to whom he licensed the rights.<ref name="Tetens 2015 47"/><ref name="Kenyon 1901 121">{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1901|p=121}}</ref> An appreciative Caine acknowledged Barratt's substantial contribution by naming him co-writer.<ref>{{Harvnb|Caine|1908|p=346}}</ref>

===First visit to Iceland===
The first title published by [[Heinemann (publisher)|Heinemann]] was Caine's 1890 three-volume novel ''[[The Bondman (novel)|The Bondman]]'', a plot of revenge and romance set in the late 18th century Isle of Man and [[Iceland]]. It commences with the story of a seaman who marries the daughter of Iceland's Governor-General, abandoning her before the birth of their child.<ref name="EliotRose2009">{{cite book|last1=Eliot|first1=Simon|last2=Rose|first2=Jonathan|title=A Companion to the History of the Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R8Pfs146nUAC&pg=PA343|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781405192781|page=343}}</ref> Between June and November 1889 it was serialised in the ''Isle of Man Times'', ''General Advertiser'' and several provincial newspapers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tetens|2015|pp=91,227}}</ref> Accompanied by Mary, Caine made a research visit to Iceland in August 1889, during which he made a seventy-mile round day trip from [[Reykavik]] to [[Krysuvik]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Caine|1905|pp=ix–x}}Bram Stoker Introduction to Hall Caine, The Bondman</ref> [[William Heinemann]] was so pleased with initial sales, eventually selling almost half a million copies, that he named his company's [[telegraphic address]] after the novel's main character, "Sunlocks".<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=202}}</ref>

===Cumbria===
Caine leased Castlerigg Cottage in [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]] in 1888. The following year Caine bought Hawthorns out of part of his earnings from ''Ben-my-Chree''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sherard|1895|p=92}}</ref> Hawthorns was a small square-built stone house on the Penrith Road, a mile outside Keswick, overlooking [[Bassenthwaite Lake]] and Derwentwater.  Caine also rented a [[Pied-à-terre]] at Albert Mansions, Victoria Street, London.  Hawthorns was close to Chesnut Cottage that [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]] had rented in 1811 and [[Greta Hall]] home of the poets [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] and [[Robert Southey|Southey]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|pp=192–193,196–197}}</ref> The house had ten acres of land where Caine kept two ponies he had transported from Iceland.<ref>{{cite news|title=Literary Gossip|work= The Globe|date=23 November 1889|page=6}}</ref> Mary learned to make butter and cheese. The Caines lived at Hawthorns for four years.

Around 1890 Caine published a magazine serial called ''Drink: A Love Story on a Great Question''. This was about the same time as [[Bram Stoker]] began his notes for his ''[[Dracula]]'' novel. Stoker and Caine were lifetime literary friends. They shared an interest in [[mesmerism]]. ''Drink'' contains a number of similarities to Stoker's novel.<ref>{{Harvnb|Skall|2016|p=296}}</ref>{{incomplete short citation|date=July 2021}}  In 1906 ''Drink'' was published by [[George Newnes Ltd|George Newnes]], and illustrated by expatriate Italian American illustrator and painter [[Cyrus Cuneo]]. It was described in the ''Manchester Guardian'' as 'a rather gruesome love story'.<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=314}}</ref> The story is of a girl who inherits a taste for alcohol from her father and is put on the road to recovery by hypnotic influence. Two hundred thousand copies of the book had been sold in England by the time the American edition was published by [[D. Appleton & Company|Appleton]] in 1907.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hall Caine and Hypnotism.; A Pup's Philosophy|work=The New York Times|date=26 January 1907}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=125}}</ref>

===Banning of ''Mahomet''===
Caine's ''Mahomet'' is a four-act historical drama based on the life of [[Muhammad]], the [[prophet]] of [[Islam]], written in 1890 for the actor-manager [[Henry Irving]].  In Autumn 1889 Irving presented a copy of [[Henri de Bornier]]'s new play ''Mahomet'' to Caine, translated into English by [[Bram Stoker]]'s wife, Florence.<ref>{{Harvnb| Tetens|2015|p=107}}</ref> Irving had been granted the English rights by [[Jules Claretie]], director of France's [[Comédie-Française|Théâtre Français]] and he asked Caine to revise it for staging at the Lyceum.<ref>{{Harvnb| Tetens|2015|p=53}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb| Foulkes|2008|p=49}}</ref> The French government stopped Bornier's play on 22 March 1890, partly due to the intervention of the Ottoman Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]].<ref>{{Harvnb| Tetens|2015|pp=115–120}}</ref> Caine called the play's plot "false to history, untrue to character, Western in thought and Parisian in sentiment".<ref>{{cite news|title=Hall Caine, A Literary Causerie|work=The Speaker|date=4 October 1890}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb| Foulkes|2008|p=53}}</ref> He continued with his own version that concentrated on Muhammad's flight from Mecca and his triumphant return from Medina years later.<ref>{{Harvnb| Foulkes|2008|p=54}}</ref> Scenes were handwritten by Caine and subsequently reviewed by Irving after Stoker had them typed. Reviewed pages were returned with Irving's edits and often Stoker's suggestions.<ref>{{Harvnb| Tetens|2015|p=114}}</ref> On 20 June a piece appeared in the French ''[[Journal des débats]]'' soon followed by a longer piece in ''[[The Pall Mall Gazette]]'' connecting Bornier's ''Mahomet'' with Irving's English production.<ref>{{Harvnb| Foulkes|2008|p=57}}</ref> [[Abdullah Quilliam|William Henry (Abdullah) Quilliam]] orchestrated protests. In common with Caine he was of Manx descent, raised in Liverpool and had visited Morocco. Converting to Islam, Quilliam set up Britain's first mosque and was made Sheikh al-Islam for the British Isles by Abdul Hamid II.  Rumour that the play would be produced in London caused unrest in Britain's Muslim communities, threatened British rule in parts of India and strained the nation's relations with the Ottoman Empire. It was banned by the [[Lord Chamberlain]], [[Edward Bootle-Wilbraham, 1st Earl of Lathom]] in his capacity as licencer of stage plays.<ref>{{Harvnb| Foulkes|2008|p=59}}</ref> Lathom's intervention was unusual, illustrating the high level of concern by the British government.<ref>{{Harvnb| Tetens|2015|p=196}}</ref> Caine's completed play was accepted by [[Edward Smith Willard]] for production in America. Influenced by Renan's ''Life of Christ'' he spent the remainder of 1890 hastily writing his own version. Dissatisfied with the result he refused to publish the book, despite being offered three thousand pounds for it in 1894.<ref>{{Harvnb| Sherard|1895|p=92}}</ref>

===Morocco===
Caine travelled to [[Tangier]], [[Morocco]], for three weeks in March 1890, researching [[Muslim]] and [[Jewish]] life.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tetens|2015|p=114}}</ref> Disregarding the advice of British consular officials Caine explored the Kasbah alone on foot at all hours of the day and night.<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=209}}</ref> Returning to Tangier in Spring 1891 to pick up local colour for his next novel ''The Scapegoat'', he suffered an attack of [[malarial fever]].<ref name="London Correspondence">{{cite news|title=London Correspondence|work=Birmingham Daily Post|date=6 July 1891|page=4}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Caine|first1=Hall|title=The Scapegoat|date=1899|publisher=P.F.

===Mission to Russia===
Following the publication of ''The Scapegoat'', Caine was approached by [[Hermann Adler]], the Chief [[Rabbi]] and chairman of the Russo-Jewish Committee. Jews were fleeing Russia due to the [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|pogroms]] and resulting atrocities happening there.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mr Hall Caine's Mission to Russia|work=Pall Mall Gazette|date=25 September 1891|page=5}}</ref> Adler, certain no [[Jew]] would be allowed entry, requested Caine go to Russia and Poland on behalf of the committee. Caine's plans to depart for Russia after Christmas 1891 were delayed until 15 June 1892 due to famine and riots there.<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|pp=214–215,217}}</ref> Caine funded the trip himself, refusing subsidies offered by the committee. He carried Adler's letter, in [[Hebrew]], to present to the rabbis in the various towns on his journey, which "secured him everywhere a most hospitable reception" and for protection against the Russian authorities Caine carried a letter from [[Lord Salisbury]], then Prime Minister.<ref>{{Harvnb| Sherard|1895|p=93}}</ref> Caine managed to visit several Jewish communities in the [[Pale of Settlement]] but got no further than the frontier towns as many were dying due to a cholera outbreak. Fearing he was to suffer the same fate he returned to London, in time to attend [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|
Lord Alfred Tennyson's]] funeral in October 1892.<ref name="Allen 1997 222">{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=222}}</ref> Caine remained in London after the funeral working on three novellas ''Cap'n Davey's Honeymoon'', ''The Last Confession'' and ''The Blind Mother'', published in 1893 as one volume entitled ''Cap'n Davey's Honeymoon''. The book was edited by and dedicated to Stoker. At his suggestion, the last part of the title story was rewritten and ''The Last Confession'' was added.<ref name="Allen 1997 222"/> Set in Morocco, ''The Last Confession'' is based on Rossetti's blank-verse poem of the same name.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1901|p=125}}</ref>

===Isle of Man===
For the purpose of writing [[The Manxman (novel)|''The Manxman'']] Caine rented [[Greeba Castle]] for six months, a [[Crenellation|castellated]] house in the Isle of Man overlooking the [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]] to [[Peel, Isle of Man|Peel]] road.<ref name="Norris 1947 9">{{Harvnb|Norris|1947|p=9}}</ref> It was this book, published as one volume in August 1894 by Heinemann, that ended the system of three-volume novels.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Harvnb|Caine|1905|p=vi}} Bram Stoker Introduction to Hall Caine, The Manxman</ref> It is the story of Pete, a fisherman, considered by Kate's father as too poor to marry her.

Caine wrote a guidebook entitled ''The Little Man Island: Scenes and Specimen Days in the Isle of Man'' for the 1894 tourist season. Published by the [[Isle of Man Steam Packet Company]] it comprises a mixture of descriptions, pictures and advertising.  At the end of the 19th century the Isle of Man was a popular tourist destination, a result of the [[Wakes Week]]s, when Lancashire mills and factories closed for holidays.<ref>{{Harvnb| Belchem |2001|p=223}} Volume 5</ref> To meet growing demand the [[Isle of Man Steam Packet Company]] purchased new steamers to bring many thousands of tourists to Douglas from Liverpool.

===Canadian copyright===
At a time [[Copyright law of Canada|copyrights in Canada]] were governed by British laws and legal framework the Canadian Government was attempting to enact their 1889 Copyright Bill.

At the request of the Canadian Copyright Association Caine went to Toronto where he had talks with the Toronto publishers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Seville |2006|p=129}}</ref> Caine resolved the dispute between the Canadian publishers, the Canadian Copyright Association and English authors. The proposed solution, that Canadian publishers would have the right to republish copyright works that had not been published in Canada within sixty days of publication elsewhere, was incorporated into the draft copyright bill. On 25 November 1895 Caine presented the draft bill at the Ottawa copyright conference where all parties agreed to it.<ref>{{cite book|title=Full text of "Conference on the copyright question"|date=1896|publisher=Canada Dept of Agriculture|url=https://archive.org/stream/conferenceoncopy00cana/conferenceoncopy00cana_djvu.txt|language=en}}</ref> The Canadian authorities and publishers were satisfied with the proposal put forward from England as were the American authors and publishers.<ref>{{cite news|title= Mr Hall Caine and the Copyright Question|work= Birmingham Daily Post|date=12 December 1895|page=5}}</ref> The bill never became law, the 1889 Act was abandoned and a more flexible solution was found by 1900.<ref name="Alexander 2010 252"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Lamonde|2005|p=156}}</ref>

Caine followed it with a lecture tour of Scotland, a one-man dramatic performance of his novelette ''Home Sweet Home''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|pp=250–251}}</ref> ''The Christian'' was serialised in Britain in the ''[[Windsor Magazine]]'' between December 1896 and November 1897 and in the United States in ''[[Munsey's Magazine]]'' between November 1896 and January 1898.  Mainly set in Victorian London, it is the story of Glory Quayle, a young woman living an independent life who becomes an actress, and John Storm, who enters the priesthood. It was the first time that Caine had taken up [[the Woman Question]]. The character of John Storm is drawn from a composite of the Hon. and Rev.  James Adderley, an Anglican priest of Berkley Chapel, Mayfair, London, and [[George Stanton|Father Stanton]], who became an Anglican bishop.<ref>{{Harvnb| Adderley |1916|pp=176–177}}</ref> Caine dramatised the book in 1896.

===Rome===
Caine and his wife, Mary, spent four winters in Rome, renting a house, 18 Trinità de' Monti, near the [[Spanish Steps]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Hall Caine in New York|work=Chicago Tribune|date=19 October 1902|page=1}}</ref> On their visit between January and April 1901 Caine finished ''The Eternal City'', his greatest commercial success.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tetens|2015|p=82}}</ref> It is Caine's only novel to be first conceived as a play.<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=271}}</ref> The story begins in Rome in 1900 at the fictional Pope Pius X's [[Jubilee (Christianity)|jubilee celebrations]], at the height of the dispute between the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] and the Italian state on the [[Temporal power (papal)|temporal power]] of the Church. David Rossi, a socialist and republican is accused of conspiring to assassinate the Italian king. He opposes Baron Bonelli, a corrupt prime minister. Bonelli tries to prevent the culmination of the love story between his mistress Donna Roma Volonna and Rossi. ''The Eternal City'' was serialised in Britain in 1901 in [[The Lady's Magazine]] and in the United States in [[Collier's Weekly]], between February and August 1901. Immediately afterwards it was published in book form by Heinemann, with an initial print run of 100,000, running to twenty-six editions, selling more than a million copies in English alone and translated into thirteen languages.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tetens|2015|p=228}}</ref> The stage adaptation opened at [[Her Majesty's Theatre|His Majesty's Theatre]], London on 2 October 1902, produced by actor-manager [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]], with [[incidental music]] by Italian composer [[Pietro Mascagni]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Tetens|2015|pp=78–80}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Mallach|2002|pp=151–152}}</ref> A week after the play opened in London, Caine republished the novel, cutting all the political parts and following the story of the play making it into a 'theatre edition'.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tetens|2015|p=83}}</ref> The American production of ''The Eternal City'' premiered on 17 November, at the Victoria Theatre, New York City, with [[Viola Allen]] as Roma, [[Frederic De Belleville]] as Bonelli, and Edward J.

===Second visit to Iceland===
To obtain local colour for his novel ''[[The Prodigal Son (Hall Caine novel)|The Prodigal Son]]'' Caine visited Iceland in 1903. On one of two exploration trips that started from Reykjavik Caine discovered a cave about 200 feet long in the valley of [[Thingvellir]], afterwards named "Hall's Hellin" (Hall's cave).<ref>{{cite news|title=Mr Hall Caine's Iceland Explorations|work=St James' Gazette|date=2 October 1903|page=7}}</ref> On 26 August Caine was at the close of the Iceland [[Althing]] where he was a guest of Magnús Stephensen, the island's Governor.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mr. Hall Caine in Iceland|work=Gloucestershire Echo|date=7 September 1903|page=1}}</ref> At the Parliamentary dinner which followed, Caine was introduced "as a distinguished "skald" (bard), whose writings were widely known and greatly admired in Iceland".<ref>{{cite news|title=Mr. Hall Caine in Iceland|work=The Advertiser|location=Adelaide|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/5007566|date=9 October 1903|page=4 }}</ref> ''The Prodigal Son'' was published in November 1904 by Heinemann and translated into thirteen languages. It is set in a sheep-rearing community in rural Iceland, with scenes in London and the [[French Riviera]].  In ''The Prodigal Son'' Magnus learns on his wedding day that his bride, Thora, is in love with his brother Oscar, a composer. She marries Oscar after Magnus releases her from the engagement. When Thora dies, a distraught Oscar places the only copies of his compositions in her coffin. Later he has her grave opened and his music retrieved. Caine's use of a similar event to Rossetti's exhumation of Elizabeth Siddal, where Rossetti recovered his poems that he had buried with her, caused a lasting rift between Caine and the Rossetti family.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tetens|2015|p=90}}</ref> ''The Prodigal Son'' was simultaneously dramatised, the copyright performance held at the Grand Theatre, [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]].  American and British productions opened days apart in 1905, at the [[National Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|National Theatre in Washington, D. C.]] on 28 August, the [[New Amsterdam Theatre]] in New York City on 4 September and at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], London on 7 September, with [[George Alexander (actor)|George Alexander]] playing Oscar and Caine's sister Lilian playing Thora.<ref>{{cite news|title=Heard in the Green-Room|work=The Sketch|date=6 September 1905|page=37}}</ref> After a long run at Drury Lane it was revived in 1907.<ref>{{Harvnb|Barker|1999|p=28}}</ref>

In September 1906 Caine's dramatised version of ''The Bondman'' was produced in London's [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], with [[Mrs Patrick Campbell]] playing a leading role and Caine's son, Derwent (aged sixteen), making a stage début.<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=315}}</ref> A copyright performance had taken place at the Theatre Royal, Bolton in November 1982.<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=199}}</ref> Caine revised the play for [[Arthur Collins (theatre manager)|Arthur Collins]], moving part of the story to [[Sicily]] and creating a happy ending.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tetens|2015|p=92}}</ref> The highlight of the show was the sulphur mine explosion and volcano eruption. In April 1906 Collins and Caine had gone on a research trip where they spent a day with Leone Testa, the inspector-general of Sicily's sulphur mines and while visiting [[Naples]] they witnessed [[Mount Vesuvius]] erupt. The show ran for eleven weeks followed by eight weeks at the [[Adelphi Theatre]] and a revival of The Prodigal Son. The production went on tour in the UK and America.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tetens|2015|p=95}}</ref> 
Japanese actor and a founder of Japanese modern theatre [[Otojirō Kawakami]] staged the play in Japan in 1909, changing the setting to Japan and the Philippines and included the volcanic eruption. When Kawakami's new western style theatre Teikoku-za opened in Osaka in March 1910 the first production was The Bondman.

1908 saw the publication of ''My Story'', described by Bram Stoker as "autobiographical rather than an autobiography and gives insight to the life and character of his many friends and their influence on his life and work, and of the gradual growth of his mind and of his importance in the world as the success of each book gave him further opportunities."<ref>{{cite news|first=Bram|last=Stoker|title=The Ethics of Hall Caine|work= The Homiletic Review| date=August 1909|page=98|url=http://www.bramstoker.org/pdf/nonfic/ethics.pdf|access-date=3 March 2017}}</ref>

===Egyptian nationalism===
On 13 June 1906 British officers shot pigeons for sport in Denshawai, an Egyptian village whose inhabitants were pigeon farmers, resulting in a clash between the officers and several villagers.  One villager, falsely accused of murder was killed on the spot. Four villagers were hanged and others punished by jail sentences, hard labour and lashings. The [[Denshawai Incident]] proved a turning point in the history of the British occupation of Egypt, starting a fierce political debate both in Egypt and Britain in which intellectuals and men of letters participated, eventually causing the resignation of [[Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer|Lord Cromer]], the redoubtable British Consul General and de facto ruler of Egypt since 1882. Crucially poet [[Wilfred Scawen Blunt]] exposed the facts in his pamphlet ''Atrocities of Justice Under British Rule in Egypt'', provoking a public outcry in Britain. [[George Bernard Shaw]] drafted a petition published in ''The New Age'' with the main purpose of gaining the release of the Egyptian prisoners.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Denshawai Prisoners|url=http://wallace-online.org/content/frameset?keywords=denshawai&pageseq=1&itemID=S646a&viewtype=text|access-date=28 April 2017|website=wallace-online.org|language=en}}</ref> Shaw denounces the "Denshawai horror" in his ''Preface to Politicians'' that introduces his ''John Bull's Other Island''.

On 15 August 1910, Caine's new stage adaptation of ''The Deemster'' entitled ''The Bishop's Son'' opened at the Grand Theatre, [[Douglas, Isle of Man]], with Caine's son, Derwent, playing Dan. It went on to open at London's [[Garrick Theatre]] on 28 September 1910 with [[Bransby Williams]] as Dan, which ran for seven performances.

==Politics==
On 24 October 1901 Caine was elected a [[Member of the House of Keys]] in a by-election as a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] for the constituency of [[Ramsey, Isle of Man]], by a majority of 267 votes. Caine sought election to the Keys after the collapse of [[Dumbell's Bank|Dumbell's Banking Company]] on [[February 1900#February 2, 1900 (Friday)|Friday 2 February 1900]].<ref>Peel City Guardian, Saturday, 10 February 1900; Page: 4</ref><ref>Manx Sun, Saturday, 10 February 1900; Page: 21</ref> The crash resulted in a number of resignations and retirements, resulting in eleven by-elections.<ref>{{Harvnb| Kermode |2001|p=26}}</ref> The Bank had held most of the island's cash deposits and left businesses and residents without money.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Manx Sun History of Dumbell's Bank|year=1900|url=http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/fulltext/ms1900/p001.htm}}</ref> At the General election in 1903 Caine was re-elected for another five years.

During Caine's election campaign he supported dominion status for the Island with a Manxman as Lieutenant-Governor, a directly elected [[Legislative Council of the Isle of Man|Legislative Council]] and departmental officials appointed by and responsible to [[Tynwald]].  A pamphlet entitled ''Hall Caine's Letters and Speeches on Manx Politics'' was published in 1903, containing his election speech and articles he wrote for the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' and ''[[Black and White (magazine)|Black and White]]'', describing his experiences and aspirations. In recognition of his single election speech Caine was appointed vice-president of the Land Nationalisation Society of Great Britain.<ref>{{Harvnb|Norris|1947|p=42}}</ref>

The Manx National Reform League made constitutional and social reform the central issues in the general election of 1903, after an extra-parliamentary initiative by journalist and printer Samuel Norris. It was influenced by Liberal demands for political change in the United Kingdom. In 1903 Caine was elected the first president of the Manx National Reform League. In 1904 the new House of Keys established a committee on constitutional reform, chaired by Caine, that prepared the 1907 petition for constitutional reform.<ref>{{Harvnb| Kermode|2001|pp=39–42}}</ref>

Caine retired from active politics in 1908. Due to the other pressures on his time he seldom spoke in the Keys. He also had little time to offer to politics on a larger scale. Prior to the Ramsey by-election, Caine was invited by [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]] to stand for the [[British parliament]] but he refused.<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|pp=282–284}}</ref>

==The Great War==

Caine was aged 61 at the outbreak of the Great War. The British secretly set up the War Propaganda Bureau under MP [[Charles Masterman]]. Caine was one of twenty-five leading authors Masterman invited to the Bureau's London headquarters, [[Wellington House]] on 2 September 1914 with the purpose of best [[British propaganda during World War I|promoting Britain's interests during the war]].<ref>{{Harvnb| Buitenhuis |2011|p=14}}</ref> Shortly after, Caine was one of fifty-three of the leading authors in Britain to sign the 'Authors' Declaration', a manifesto drafted by Masterman stating that Britain "could not without dishonour have refused to take part in the present war." Issued on 17 September the document was sent by special cable to the ''New York Times''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pen and Sword Pt.

Following the [[Rape of Belgium]] Caine edited ''King Albert's Book'' in support of the exiled [[Albert I of Belgium|King Albert of Belgium]].<ref>Caine, Hall (ed.), ''King Albert's Book, a Tribute to the Belgian King and People from representative men and women throughout the World'' (The Daily Telegraph, in conjunction with The Daily Sketch, The Glasgow Herald and Hodder & Stoughton, Christmas 1914) ''"Sold in aid of the Daily Telegraph Belgian Fund."''</ref> It was Caine's idea and was published at Christmas 1914 by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''. The proceeds from the book, £20,000, went to the Daily Telegraph Belgium Fund, a fund created to support British efforts to receive and maintain Belgian refugees in Britain. In previous years Caine had edited several of these volumes already, the most recent for Queen Alexandra's charities in 1905 and 1908. Caine invited authors, artists, composers, statesmen and many notable people to present their view of events in Belgium. ''King Albert‘s Book'' contains contributions from two hundred and fifty of the most famous people of the time. Among the contributors are British [[Prime Minister Asquith]] and then Lord of the Admiralty [[Winston Churchill]], painters [[Claude Monet]] and [[John Collier (painter)|John Collier]] and composer [[Claude Debussy]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Britain's homage to 'plucky Belgium'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-one/11295047/Britains-homage-to-plucky-Belgium.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216235422/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-one/11295047/Britains-homage-to-plucky-Belgium.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 December 2014|website=The Telegraph|access-date=29 May 2017|language=en|date=16 December 2014|last1=Rainey|first1=Sarah}}</ref>

King Albert of Belgium made Caine an Officer of the [[Order of Leopold II|Order of Leopold of Belgium]] for his humanitarian aid to the Belgian refugees in 1918. Caine's portrait by the Belgian painter, [[Alfred Jonniaux]], was presented to him by the Fine Art Department of the Belgian Government.<ref>{{cite news|title=Books of the Day|work=Illustrated London News|date=6 August 1921|page=8}}</ref><ref name=Jonniaux group=nb/>

Caine wrote extensively in the English, American and Italian newspapers. He claimed that by this work and his personal influence with Italian statesmen he greatly helped bring Italy into the war on the side of the allies.<ref name="Norris 1947 62"/> President [[Woodrow Wilson]] had declared the United States neutral and his policy of neutrality was enormously popular with the American people.<ref>{{cite web|title=President Wilson's Declaration of Neutrality – World War I Document Archive|url=https://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/President_Wilson's_Declaration_of_Neutrality|website=wwi.lib.byu.edu|access-date=3 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> 
Caine urged America to join the war by writing articles, mainly for ''[[The New York Times]]'' and in 1915 he gave a series of lectures in the United States but these were not well received. In September 1915, at the conclusion of the first year of war, a series of articles featuring royalty, countries and events which included [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Ferdinand]], the [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser]] and the [[Sinking of the RMS Lusitania]] that Caine had contributed to ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' were published as a book entitled ''The Drama of 365 Days: Scenes in the Great War''. Caine attended Nurse [[Edith Cavell]]'s memorial service in [[St Paul's Cathedral]], London, on 29 October 1915; the World War I British nurse who is celebrated for saving the lives of soldiers in Brussels from all sides without distinction. His account was published in The Daily Telegraph on 30 October and extensively in other newspapers.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Daily Telegraph | title=The Martyr Nurse | pages=9–10 | date=30 October 1915|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/ww1-archive/11961168/Daily-Telegraph-October-30-1915.html|first=Hall|last=Caine|access-date=11 December 2018|language=en}}</ref> In 1916 he was invited to work with [[Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood|Lord Robert Cecil]] at the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] towards the creation of the [[League of Nations]] after the end of the war. ''Our Girls: Their Work for the War'', is the title of Caine's Christmas book published by [[Hutchinson (publisher)|Messrs Hutchinson]] early in December 1916, consisting of a series of Caine's articles written for the [[Ministry of Munitions]], together with additional stories of women's working lives in the factories and in the hospitals. It was designed to be a gift for [[Munitionettes|munitions girls]] to send to their men at the front.

The National War Aims Committee was set up in 1917 to focus on domestic propaganda. Caine was recruited for the committee by the Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] to write the screenplay for the [[World War I film propaganda|propaganda]] film ''[[Victory and Peace]]'', designed to show what would happen in a German invasion.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hall Caine's Task|work=Shields Daily News|date=10 November 1917|page=4}}</ref> Most of the negative of the newly finished film was destroyed in a fire at the offices of the London Film Company in June 1918.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sir Hall Caine's propaganda film destroyed|work=Aberdeen Press and Journal|date=19 June 1918|page=4}}</ref> It was re-filmed over four-months, just as the war ended and was never released.<ref>{{Harvnb|Slide |2015|Chapter=11}}</ref>

Towards the end of 1917 Caine was offered a [[baron]]etcy in recognition of the contribution he made to the war effort as an allied propagandist and his position as a leading [[intellectual|man of letters]]. Caine declined the hereditary peerage and accepted a [[knight]]hood instead. He was made [[Order of the British Empire|Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire(KBE)]], insisting on being called, not 'Sir Thomas' but 'Sir Hall'.<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|pp=367–368}}</ref>

==After the war==

Begun in 1914 Caine's ''[[The Master of Man|The Master of Man: The Story of a Sin]]'' had been set aside for the duration of the Great War and resumed on the day after [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|armistice in 1918]]. It is the story of Bessie Collister who has an illegitimate child. The baby's father Victor Stowell, as judge, has to try Bessie for the murder of their child. Heinmann published the novel in July 1921. Of the initial one hundred thousand copies printed seventy thousand were advance orders.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/BL/0000540/19210727/338/0006?browse=False|title=Hall Caine's New Novel|date=27 July 1921|work=The Scotsman}}</ref> Due to his age and health Caine announced it was to be his last novel.<ref>{{cite news |title=Books and Bookmen |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/ESD19210827.2.22 |work=Evening Star |issue=17751 |date=27 August 1921}}</ref> Sales of ''The Eternal City'' in English had reached one million and fifty-two English editions of ''The Deemster'' had been published.<ref>{{cite news |title=A Master of Millions |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/ODT19210910.2.3.2 |work=Otago Daily Times |issue=18347 |date=10 September 1921}}</ref>

The following year Caine acquired the ''Sunday Illustrated'' newspaper which had been founded by [[Horatio Bottomley]].

Caine's last novel ''[[The Woman of Knockaloe]]'' was brought out in 1923, this time published by [[Cassell (publisher)|Cassell's]].  Caine's strong anti-German feeling had turned to advocacy of reconciliation and pacifism. In the editorial note Newman Flower explains that the story was never intended to be published, but Flower happened to see the manuscript and persuaded Caine to publish it immediately. The book deals with the harm caused by racial hatred after Mona Craine, a British woman, falls in love with Oskar Heine, a German prisoner of war. The scene of the story is Knockaloe, a farm on the west coast of the Isle of Man, turned into an [[List of concentration and internment camps#Isle of Man|internment camp 1914–1918]] for [[Enemy alien|alien civilians]]. Caine was former part owner of the farm and suggested the establishment of the camp to the government. The camp was the first and largest of its kind in Europe, containing about twenty-five thousand aliens and two thousand British guard. The site was overlooked by Greeba Castle, Caine's Manx house, four miles away.<ref>{{cite news |title=London Diary |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001898/19230913/058/0004 |access-date=7 April 2019 |work=Nottingham Journal |date=13 September 1923}}</ref> That year he sold the ''Sunday Illustrated''.

Caine's last published work in his lifetime was a revised version of ''Recollections of Rossetti'', with a shortened title, to coincide with the 1928 centenary of Rossetti's birth.

During the last eight years of his life Caine devoted himself to his life's work a ''Life of Christ'', which he had begun in 1893. On at least three occasions Caine visited [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordania]], the last in 1929; consulting the best-known theologians of the time, and reading every book he could obtain on the subject. His health broke down under the strain and the book remained unfinished. In the statement he prepared for his obituary was written, "one-fifth of the book is in a form fit for publication, the remainder not being in a condition which renders it possible that another author should complete it".<ref>{{Harvnb| Norris |1947 |p=68}}</ref> The statement was disregarded by his sons and after extensive editing the book was published posthumously by his sons in 1938. The handwritten manuscript, including text and words, contained three million words, much of it indecipherable, to the extent that Caine's former secretaries were called in to transcribe it. An editor, journalist Robert Leighton was employed to cut it down to half-a-million words. "It was severely criticised by the reviewers and the sales were not large".<ref>{{Harvnb| Norris |1947 |pp=66–69}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|pp=428–429}}</ref>

Along with [[Winston Churchill]], Caine received the [[Order of the Companions of Honour]] in October 1922 for his services to literature and was granted the [[Freedom of the City|Freedom]] of Douglas in 1929 for promoting the Isle of Man through his writings.<ref>{{Harvnb| Norris |1947 |pp=62–63}}</ref>

===1910s===
Most of Caine's novels have been made into [[black-and-white]] [[silent film|silent]] films. The first film adaptation is [[The Christian (1911 film)|''The Christian'']] (1911), by [[West's Pictures]] in Australia. The twenty-eight-minute unauthorised film is the first directed by [[Franklyn Barrett]]. ''The Christian'' features the cast of the stage production by [[William Anderson (theatre)|William Anderson]]'s Company. An unauthorised film of [[The Bondman (1916 film)|''The Bondman'']] (1916) was made by [[Fox Film Corporation]] in the United States and is the first film they released under their De Luxe brand. All of Fox's 110 musicians accompanied ''The Bondman'' screenings. The music is composed by [[Max Steiner]], Fox's musical director. A financial and critical success it was re-released in 1918 as one of Fox's Big Six. A further film version of ''The Bondman'' was released as ''[[The Red Samson]]'' (1917) in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The director was [[Michael Curtiz]], who had by 1916 become one of Hungary's most important directors.<ref>{{cite web |title=Michael Curtiz {{!}} Biography, Movies, Assessment, & Facts |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Michael-Curtiz |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |access-date=13 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref>

The first authorised film of a Caine novel is ''[[The Christian (1914 film)|The Christian]]'' (1914) released in the United States by the [[Vitagraph|Vitagraph Liebler Company]]. The first eight reel film they made. Vitagraph leased the Harris Theatre on West 42nd Street, for the purpose of exclusively showing their own films, opening with ''The Christian'' starring [[Earle Williams]] and [[Edith Storey]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Vitagraph article|url=http://www.silentsaregolden.com/articles/vitagrapharticle.html|website=www.silentsaregolden.com}}</ref> Caine wrote the film scenario, the first time ever that a famous author undertook a film scenario of their own work. Vitagraph staff writer Eugene Mullins followed Caine's own scenario.<ref>{{cite news|title=The sun.

Adapted and directed by established American screenwriter and director [[George Loane Tucker]], ''[[The Christian (1915 film)|The Christian]]'' (1915) was made by the [[London Film Company]]. The 9,000 feet film stars Caine's son [[Derwent Hall Caine]] as John Storm.  ''[[The Manxman (1916 film)|The Manxman]]'' (1916), also produced by the London Film Company and directed by Tucker, was filmed on the Isle of Man and, when released drew huge crowds in Britain and America. It was one of the few British films distributed in the United States that went on to become a financial and critical success.<ref>{{cite journal|last=[[National Board of Review]]|year=1951|title=Book Reviews|journal=Films in Review|publisher=National Board of Review of Motion Pictures|volume=2|page=55|issn=0015-1688}}</ref> Starring Derwent Hall Caine and [[Marian Swayne]] ''[[The Deemster (1917 film)|The Deemster]]'' (1917), made in the United States, is the first special feature film [[Arrow Film Corporation]] made.  Shot on location on [[Block Island|Block Island, Rhode Island]], the film was originally entitled ''The Bishop’s Son'' after Caine's 1910 stage adaptation of ''The Deemster'' in which Derwent had also played Dan Mylrea and on which the film is based.  Caine remained closely involved with the production; based in England, Caine reviewed the scenario and produced drawings of the character of the buildings to be used.

[[Adolph Zukor]]'s Famous Players Film Company produced the first version of [[The Eternal City (1915 film)|''The Eternal City'']] (1915). The $100,000 epic film features stage star [[Pauline Frederick]]. Made on location in London and Italy in 1914 the production was interrupted by the start of the [[Great War]] and was completed in New York. For distribution of initially ''The Eternal City'' and other prestigious feature-length films Famous Players created the Select Booking Agency. Caine cabled the producers after attending the British premiere at Marble Arch Pavilion, in London congratulating them.<ref>{{cite news |title=England Likes "Eternal City" |url=https://archive.org/stream/clipper63-1915-10#page/n65/ |work=New York Clipper |publisher=New York, NY: Frank Queen Publishing Co. |date=9 October 1915 |page=18}}</ref> The film was re-released in 1918 as part of the Paramount "Success Series".

Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] recruited Caine in 1917 to write the screenplay for the propaganda film ''[[Victory and Peace]]'' (1918), made in Britain and directed by [[Herbert Brenon]]. Caine was appointed as chief adviser to the film campaign department of the National War Aims Committee. Lloyd George chose Caine due to his experience in the field of cinema and his "reputation as a man of letters".<ref>{{cite news|title=Letter from Lloyd George to Hall Caine, dated 23 October 1917, reprinted in the Daily Telegraph|work=Daily Telegraph|date=10 November 1917}}</ref> On 20 September 1917, in [[Ithaca, New York]], Brenon's representative obtained the film rights of ''The Woman Thou Gavest Me'' from [[Derwent Hall Caine]], Caine's American agent, intending to start work in November 1917. The film was advertised but it was never made by Brenon. Adapted for the screen by [[Beulah Marie Dix]], ''[[The Woman Thou Gavest Me]]'' (1919) was made by [[Famous Players-Lasky]]. [[Katherine MacDonald]], stars in the film as Mary MacNeil. Immediately after completing ''The Woman Thou Gavest Me'' she set up her own production company.<ref>{{cite news |title=Katherine MacDonald Heads Company |work=The Moving Picture World |date=14 June 1919 |page=1652}}</ref>

===1920s===
Caine wrote the screenplay of ''[[Darby and Joan (1920 film)|Darby and Joan]]'' (1920). Made by Master Films the film was directed by [[Percy Nash]] featuring [[Derwent Hall Caine]] and [[Ivy Close]]. Many of the scenes were shot in the Isle of Man.<ref>{{cite news|title=Globe|date=7 January 1918|page=3}}</ref>

The fourth film adaptation of ''[[The Christian (1923 film)|The Christian]]'' (1923) was by [[Goldwyn Pictures]] and directed by the celebrated [[Maurice Tourneur]]. Along with some of the cast, Tourneur travelled to the Isle of Man for location shooting where they were joined by Caine who co-operated in the filming of his work and held daily conferences with Tourneur.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Motion Picture News |first1=Inc |title=Motion Picture News (May–Jun 1922) |date=1922 |page=3250 |url=https://archive.org/details/motionpicturenew25mayj/page/3250 |publisher=New York, Motion Picture News, Inc}}</ref> After the film was completed in the United States a print was sent to Caine in London where he wrote the intertitles.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Moving Picture World (Sep–Oct 1922) |date=1922 |page=32 |url=https://archive.org/details/movingpicturewor58sept/page/32 |publisher=New York, Chalmers Publishing Company}}</ref>

Adapted and directed by [[A.E. Coleby]] ''[[The Prodigal Son (1923 film)|The Prodigal Son]]'' (1923) was made by [[Stoll Pictures]], the largest British film company of the early 1920s, as the centrepiece of their 1923 releases. Costing £37,000 it was at the time the most expensive British production made. The film's length at 18,454 feet made it the longest commercially made British film. The 4-hour 40-minute picture was released in two parts; part two titled ''The Return of the Prodigal''.

[[Benito Mussolini]] featured in ''[[The Eternal City (1923 film)|The Eternal City]]'' (1923) by the Samuel Goldwyn Company. Directed by [[George Fitzmaurice]] and shot on location in Rome less than a year after the [[March on Rome]] resulted in Mussolini's [[National Fascist Party]] rising to power in Italy. The film portrays Mussolini as a leader saving his people from communism. Caine disapproved of the adaptation and attempted to withdraw his name from it.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brownlow|1990|p=457}}</ref>

The first American made film by noted Swedish actor-director [[Victor Sjöström]] for [[Goldwyn Pictures]] was adapted from [[The Master of Man]]. The title was changed to "The Judge and the Woman" before settling on ''[[Name the Man]]'' (1924). [[Samuel Goldwyn]] began negotiating the film rights before the novel was finished.<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=373}}</ref>

''The Woman of Knockaloe'' was filmed by [[Paramount Pictures]] in 1927 as ''[[Barbed Wire (1927 film)|Barbed Wire]]'' and is the second American made film by German director [[Erich Pommer]]. It deals with a phase of WWI where German prisoners of war suffer the hatred of the French women and yet find romance. Then [[Alfred Hitchcock]] arrived on the Isle of Man to film ''[[The Manxman]]'' (1929) but he and Caine did not get on well and the rest of the film was shot in Cornwall.  ''The Manxman'' was Hitchcock's last silent film. Caine was not happy with it.<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=416}}</ref>

The British silent film ''[[The Bondman (1929 film)|The Bondman]]'' (1929) was directed by [[Herbert Wilcox]].

===1930s===
After retiring from the army in 1922, Colonel Hanna joined the [[British Board of Film Censors]] and held the position of vice-president and chief censor throughout the 1930s. [[Gaumont British]]'s plan to film ''The White Prophet'' was abandoned after objections by Colonel Hanna as he thought it contained scenes with "a tendency to bring the British army into contempt and ridicule" and that "no scene of cavalry charging the mob and causing 100 deaths….would be permissible on the screen".<ref>{{Harvnb|Richards|2010|p=146}}</ref>

Shortly before Caine's death in 1931, [[Metro Goldwyn Mayer]] purchased the screen rights of ''The Christian'' with the intention of making a [[talking picture]].<ref>{{cite news|title= Hall Caine Novel as Talkie|work= Daily Herald|date=1 May 1931|page=8}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Hall Caine Film|work=The Derby Daily Telegraph|date=1 May 1931|page=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Happenings of the Stage and Screen|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=13 May 1931|page=10}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article83696833 |title=Union Theatre's Scoop |newspaper=[[Daily News (Perth, Western Australia)|Daily News]] |volume=L |issue=17 |location=Western Australia |date=15 December 1931 |access-date=7 January 2018 |page=6|edition=HOME (FINAL) |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> The rights were reported as selling for £8000.

==Personal and domestic==
In appearance Caine was a short man who tended to dress in a striking fashion.  His eyes were dark brown and slightly protuberant, giving him an intense stare.  He had red-gold hair and a dark red beard which he trimmed to appear like the [[Stratford-upon-Avon|Stratford]] [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]; indeed if people did not notice the likeness he was inclined to point it out to them.<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|pp=35–36}}</ref> He was also preoccupied throughout his life with the state of his health.  This was often the result of overwork or other stresses in his life and he sometimes used nervous exhaustion as an excuse to escape from his problems.<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|pp=24, 213}}</ref>

In 1912, Derwent Hall Caine had an illegitimate daughter, Elin, and she was brought up as Caine and Mary's child.<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|pp=348–350}}</ref> By 1914 Mary at last had her own London house – Heath Brow which overlooked [[Hampstead Heath]].  After the Great War this house had become too big and Mary moved into Heath End House, again overlooking Hampstead Heath.  By 1922 they informally separated; Caine could not live with Mary, nor could he break with her completely.<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|pp=388–389}}</ref> From that time, both suffered from various ailments.

On 31 August 1931, aged 78 Caine slipped into a coma and died at his home, [[Greeba Castle]], Isle of Man.  On his death certificate is the diagnosis of "cardiac syncope".<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=423}}</ref> Following his death messages of condolence were received from the Prime Minister [[Ramsay MacDonald]], King George V and Queen Mary.
<ref>{{cite news|title=King's Condolence With Lady Hall Caine|work=The Nottingham Evening Post|date=1 September 1931|page=5}}</ref>

At Caine's funeral on Friday 4 September 1931 representatives of all branches of public life in the Isle of Man followed the coffin. Sixty thousand Manx people and holiday makers paid tribute on the 25-mile journey. At Douglas great crowds lined the route and the majority of businesses closed. An address was made by the Bishop of Man. Caine was buried in [[Maughold (parish)|Kirk Maughold]] [[churchyard]].<ref>{{cite news|title=60,000 Mourn passing of Sir Hall Caine|work=Daily Herald|date=5 September 1931|page=9}}</ref>
<ref>{{cite news|title=Funeral of Sir Hall Caine|work=Hull Daily Mail|date=4 September 1931|page=12}}</ref>

A memorial service was held at [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]], London on 9 September 1931. [[Reginald John Campbell|Rev. R. J. Campbell]] gave the address. The Prime Minister was represented by Charles Patrick Duff, and [[A. J. Sylvester|Albert James Sylvester]] represented [[Lloyd George]].
In March 1932, six months after her husband's death, Mary Hall Caine died from pneumonia. She was buried alongside her husband.

An Irish limestone obelisk depicting six characters from Caine's novels and a likeness of Mary was erected over their grave. The design is based on the ancient Maughold Parish Cross that is preserved in the churchyard.<ref>{{Harvnb|Norris|1947|p=74}}</ref> The memorial is the work of artist [[Archibald Knox (designer)|Archibald Knox]].

A statue of Hall Caine stands in Douglas, financed by money from the estate of Derwent Hall Caine.

==Postscript==

===Caine's legacy===
Hall Caine was an enormously popular and best-selling author in his time. Crowds would gather outside his houses hoping to get a glimpse of him.  He was "accorded the adulation reserved now for pop stars and footballers",<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|p=7}}</ref> and yet he is now virtually unknown.

Allen suggests two reasons for this.  First that, in comparison with Dickens, his characters are not clearly drawn, they are "frequently fuzzy at the edges" while Dickens' characters are "diamond-clear"; and Caine's characters also tend to be much the same as each other.  Something similar could also be said about his plots. Possibly the main drawback is that although Caine's books can be romantic and emotionally moving, they lack humour; they are deadly earnest and serious.<ref>{{Harvnb|Allen|1997|pp=430–431}}</ref>

At one time the Isle of Man had a second civil airport near Ramsey which was called the [[Hall Caine Airport]]. It closed in 1939.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.mers.org.im/hallcaineairport.htm |title=Hall Caine Airport |access-date=2007-09-02 |work=Mers Online |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121193606/http://www.mers.org.im/hallcaineairport.htm |archive-date=21 November 2008}}</ref>

===Critical appraisals===
* Despite his proving the wealthiest of Victorian novelists,<ref>J. Sutherland, ''The Stanford Companion to Victorian Fiction'' (1990) p. 97-9</ref> Caine has been largely dismissed as a mere [[melodrama]]tist by subsequent criticism.<ref>I. Ousby ed., ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (1995) p. 144</ref>
* [[G. K. Chesterton]] said in "A Defence of [[Penny Dreadfuls]]" that "it is quite clear that this objection, the objection brought by magistrates, has nothing to do with literary merit. Bad story writing is not a crime. Mr. Hall Caine walks the streets openly, and cannot be put in prison for an anticlimax."<ref>[http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/penny-dreadfuls.html A DEFENCE OF PENNY DREADFULS<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.cse.dmu.ac.uk</ref>
* [[Thomas Hardy]] criticised Caine for his excessive [[egotism]].<ref>M. Seymour-Smith, ''Thomas Hardy'' (1994) p. 645</ref>

===Hall Caine Airport===
{{main|Hall Caine Airport}}

Hall Caine Airport was an airfield on the [[Isle of Man]] which was located near [[Ramsey, Isle of Man|Ramsey]]. It was named after the author by his sons [[Gordon Hall Caine]] and [[Derwent Hall Caine]], who were the project initiators and Hall Caine Airport flourished for a short period prior to the outbreak of the [[Second World War]].<ref name="mers"/> From 1935 to 1937<ref name="mers">

</ref> it handled domestic scheduled passenger flights to English, Scottish and Irish airports. By 1937 it had fallen into disuse, primarily due to its location. Both [[Gordon Hall Caine]] and [[Derwent Hall Caine]] were particularly keen on the development of an aerodrome as they saw it as another bit of the island as being associated with their late father. They were said to be extremely interested in the progress of the [[Isle of Man]] and in particular its transport infrastructure. They also wished to include [[Ramsey, Isle of Man|Ramsey's]] municipal authority in the project, as they were both of the opinion that the aerodrome would bring immense benefit to the town.

The final commercial flight from Hall Caine Airport departed at 16:15hrs on Saturday 2 October 1937.<ref>Mona's Herald, Tuesday, 5 October 1937; Page: 3</ref><ref>Isle of Man Examiner, Friday, 8 October 1937; Page: 14</ref>
