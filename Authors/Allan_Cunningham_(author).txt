'''Allan Cunningham''' (7 December 1784{{snd}}30 October 1842) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] poet and author.

==Life==
He was born at [[Keir, Dumfries and Galloway|Keir]], near [[Dalswinton]], [[Dumfries and Galloway]], and first worked as a stonemason's apprentice. His father was a neighbour of [[Robert Burns]] at Ellisland, and Allan with his brother James visited [[James Hogg]], the "Ettrick shepherd", who became a friend to both.<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Cunningham, Allan|volume=7|page=633}}</ref> Cunningham's other brothers were the [[ship's doctor|naval surgeon]] [[Peter Miller Cunningham]] (1789–1864) and the poet, [[Thomas Mounsey Cunningham]] (1776–1834).

Cunningham gave his leisure to reading and writing imitations of old Scottish ballads. In 1809 he collected old [[ballad]]s for [[Robert Hartley Cromek]]'s ''Remains of [[Nithsdale]] and [[Galloway]] Song''; he sent in, however, poems of his own, which the editor inserted, even though he may have suspected their real authorship.<ref name="EB1911"/> It gained for him the friendship of [[Walter Scott]] and [[James Hogg]].

In 1810 Cunningham went to [[London]], where he worked as a parliamentary reporter and journalist till 1814, when he became clerk of the works in the studio of the sculptor, [[Francis Legatt Chantrey|Francis Chantrey]], a post he kept until Chantrey's death in 1841.<ref name="EB1911"/>
