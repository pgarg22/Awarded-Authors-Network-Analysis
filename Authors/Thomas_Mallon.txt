'''Thomas Mallon''' (born November 2, 1951) is an American novelist, essayist, and critic.  His novels are renowned for their attention to historical detail and context and for the author's crisp wit and interest in the "bystanders" to larger historical events.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/unbound/interviews/int2004-01-09.htm|title=Atlantic Unbound {{!}} Interviews {{!}} 2004.01.09|website=www.theatlantic.com|access-date=2019-12-12}}</ref>  He is the author of nine books of fiction, including ''Henry and Clara'', ''Two Moons'', ''Dewey Defeats Truman'', ''Aurora 7'', ''Bandbox'', ''Fellow Travelers'', ''Watergate'', ''Finale'', and most recently ''Landfall''.  He has also published nonfiction on [[plagiarism]] (''Stolen Words''), diaries (''A Book of One's Own''), letters (''Yours Ever'') and [[the Kennedy assassination]] (''Mrs. Paine's Garage''), as well as two volumes of essays (''Rockets and Rodeos'' and ''In Fact'').

He is a former [[literary editor]] of ''[[GQ|Gentleman's Quarterly]]'', where he wrote the "Doubting Thomas" column in the 1990s, and has contributed frequently to ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', ''The [[American scholar magazine|American Scholar]]'', and other [[periodicals]]. He was appointed a member of the [[National Endowment for the Humanities|National Council on the Humanities]] in 2002 and served as Deputy Chairman of the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] from 2005-2006.

His honors include [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggenheim]] and [[Rockefeller Foundation|Rockefeller fellowships]], the [[National Book Critics Circle]] citation for reviewing, and the Vursell prize of the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] for distinguished prose style.  He was elected as a new member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2012.<ref>"Thomas Mallon Elected to American Academy of Arts & Sciences." GW Today (April 19, 2012) Retrieved 2012-06-08</ref>

==Early life and education==

Thomas Vincent Mallon was born in [[Glen Cove, New York]] and grew up in [[Stewart Manor, New York|Stewart Manor, N.Y.]], on [[Long Island]].  His father, Arthur Mallon, was a salesman and his mother, Caroline, kept the home.  Mallon graduated from [[Sewanhaka High School]] in 1969.  He has often said that he had "the kind of happy childhood that is so damaging to a writer."<ref>Michael McGregor, "Thomas Mallon," Twenty-First-Century American Novelists, ''Dictionary of Literary Biography'', vol. 350.  Gale Cengage Learning.</ref>

Mallon went on to study English at [[Brown University]], where he wrote his undergraduate honors thesis on American author [[Mary McCarthy (author)|Mary McCarthy]].  He credits McCarthy, with whom he later became friends, as the most enduring influence on his career as a writer.<ref>André Bernard, "An Interview with Thomas Mallon," ''Five Points'', vol. XIII (January 2009): 97-114.</ref>

Mallon earned a [[Master of Arts]] and a [[Ph.D.]] from [[Harvard University]], where he wrote his [[dissertation]] on the English [[World War I]] poet [[Edmund Blunden]].  On sabbatical from [[Vassar College]] in 1982-1983, Mallon spent a year as a [[visiting scholar]] at [[St Edmund's College, Cambridge|St. Edmund's House (later College)]] at [[Cambridge University]].  It was here that he drafted most of ''A Book of One's Own'', a work of nonfiction about diarists and diary-writing.  The book's rather unexpected success earned Mallon [[Tenure (academic)|tenure]] at Vassar College, where he taught English from 1979-1991.

==Writing career==

Thomas Mallon's writing style is characterized by wit, charm and a meticulous attention to detail and character development.  His nonfiction often explores "fringe" genres—diaries, letters, plagiarism—just as his fiction frequently tells the stories of characters "on the fringes of big events."<ref>André Bernard, "An Interview with Thomas Mallon," Five Points, vol. XIII (January 2009): 97-114.</ref>

''A Book of One's Own'', an informal guide to the great diaries of literature, was published in 1984 and gave Mallon his first dose of critical acclaim.  [[Richard Eder]], writing in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (28 November 1984) called the book "an engaging meditation on the varied and irrepressible spirit of life that insists on preserving itself on paper."  In ''A Book of One's Own'', Mallon covers a wide range of diarists from [[Samuel Pepys]] to [[Anaïs Nin|Anais Nin]].  He explained his enthusiasm for the genre by saying: "Writing books is too good an idea to be left to authors."   The success of ''A Book of One's Own'' won Mallon a [[Rockefeller Fellowship]] in 1986.<ref>Thomas Mallon, "Introduction,"  ''A Book of One's Own.'' Ticknor and Fields (1984).</ref>

Mallon then began publishing 
fiction, a genre in which he'd informally dabbled throughout childhood and young adulthood.  Mallon published his first novel, ''Arts and Sciences'', in 1988 about Arthur Dunne, a 22-year-old [[Harvard University|Harvard]] graduate student in English.  Soon after its publication, in 1989, Mallon released a second nonfiction book called ''Stolen Words: Forays Into the Origins and Ravages of Plagiarism''.

''Henry and Clara'', published in 1994, established Mallon as a writer of [[historical fiction]] from that point forward.  The novel traces the lives of [[Henry Rathbone|Major Henry Rathbone]] and [[Clara Harris]], the young couple who accompanied [[Abraham Lincoln]] to [[Ford's Theatre]] on April 14, 1865.  A story of star-crossed lovers intermingles with personal and political tragedies and spans the couple's first meeting in childhood to their eventual derangement.<ref>Thomas Mallon.  ''Henry and Clara''. Picador: August 15, 1995.</ref>  Mallon's writing career took a dramatic turn when [[John Updike]] praised ''Henry and Clara'' in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', calling Mallon "one of the most interesting American novelists at work."<ref>John Updike, "Excellent Humbug," ''New Yorker,'' 70 (5 September 1994): 102-105.</ref>

Historical fiction, Mallon has declared in interviews, is the genre in which he is most interested as a writer.  "I think the main thing that has led me to write historical fiction is that it is a relief from the self," he explains.<ref>Michael Coffey, "Thomas Mallon: Picturing History and Seeing Stars," ''Publishers Weekly'' (January 20, 1997): 380-381.</ref>  American political history has been perhaps his main subject and interest; in 1994, he was the [[ghostwriter]] of former [[Dan Quayle|Vice President Dan Quayle]]'s memoir, ''Standing Firm''.<ref>[[Joe Queenan (author)|Joe Queenan]], "Ghosts in the Machine," ''New York Times ''(20 March 2005). Retrieved 2009-11-16.</ref>

After the publication of ''Henry and Clara'', Mallon went on to write seven more works of historical fiction, including his most recent novels, ''Watergate'' (2012), ''Finale'' (2015), and ''Landfall'' (2019).  ''Watergate'', a finalist for the 2013 [[PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction]],<ref>[[Ron Charles (critic)|Ron Charles]], (6 March 2012). "'Watergate' vies for hometown prize."  ''The Washington Post''.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2013/03/06/washington-writer-thomas-mallon-among-finalists-for-penfaulkner-award/</ref> is a retelling of the [[Watergate scandal]] from the perspective of seven characters, some familiar to the public memory, such as Nixon's secretary [[Rose Mary Woods]], and some brought to light from the sidelines of the scandal, such as [[Fred LaRue]].<ref>Janet Maslin. (15 February 2012). "Nixon and Friends, Stalked With Literary License,'Watergate,' a novel by Thomas Mallon." ''The New York Times''. https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/16/books/watergate-a-novel-by-thomas-mallon.html</ref>  ''Finale: A Novel of the Reagan Years'', one of the ''New York Times'''  100 Notable Books of 2015, takes readers to the political gridiron of Washington in 1986; the wealthiest enclaves of southern California; and the volcanic landscape of Iceland, where [[President Ronald Reagan]] engages in two almost apocalyptic days of negotiation with [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/06/books/review/100-notable-books-of-2015.html|title=100 Notable Books of 2015|date=2015-11-27|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-12-12|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Readers of ''Finale'' find themselves in the shoes of many characters both central and peripheral to the Reagan presidency––from Nancy Reagan to Richard Nixon to actress Bette Davis.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/books/review/finale-thomas-mallon-novel-about-ronald-reagan-review.html|title='Finale,' by Thomas Mallon|last=Draper|first=Robert|date=2015-09-16|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-12-12|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

''Landfall,'' Mallon's latest novel, takes place during the [[George W. Bush]] years against a backdrop of political catastrophe: the Iraq insurgency and [[Hurricane Katrina]], in particular. At the center of the narrative, though, is a love affair between two West Texans, Ross Weatherall and Allison O'Connor, whose destinies have been intertwined with Bush's for decades.  Many others in the wide cast of characters––such as Barbara Bush, Condoleezza Rice, Donald Rumsfeld, Christopher Hitchens, and more––will be familiar to most readers.
