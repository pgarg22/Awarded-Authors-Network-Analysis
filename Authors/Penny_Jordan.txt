Rees|last=Shapiro|date=22 January 2012}}</ref>

==Writing career==
By her early twenties, Jordan was writing for herself, but her writing career began in earnest when she was 30, encouraged and supported by her husband.  He bought her, at a time when he could ill afford it, the small electric typewriter on which she typed her first books. She entered a competition run by the [[Romantic Novelists' Association]]. Although she did not win, an agent looking for a new-style [[Georgette Heyer]], contacted the R.N.A.<ref name="Liverpool"/>

In March 1979, she published her first novel under the pseudonym Caroline Courtney, ''[[Duchess in Disguise]]'', the same year she published other 4 books. Under this pen-name she published 25 regency romances until 1986. From 1981 to 1983, she signed 3 air-hostess romps as Melinda Wright and 2 thrillers as Lydia Hitchcock, published by [[Columbine House]]. In 1981, [[Mills & Boon]] accepted her first novel for them, ''Falcon's Prey'', signed as '''Penny Jordan'''. Since then, almost 70 million copies of her 167 Mills & Boon (or [[Harlequin Enterprises Ltd|Harlequin]]) novels have been sold worldwide.<ref name="Liverpool"/>

From 2003, she returned to writing historical novels as '''Annie Groves''' (she adopted her mother's maiden-name<ref name="Liverpool"/>). Jordan gained much of her inspiration from human interest stories in the news as well as her own family history. She adapted a story told by her grandmother Elsie Jones in ''Ellie Pride''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/9026164/Penny-Jordan.html|title=Penny Jordan|journal=The Daily Telegraph|date=2012-01-19|access-date=2020-01-10|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>
