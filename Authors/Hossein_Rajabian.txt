== Imprisonment and hunger strike ==
Hossein Rajabian was sent to the ward 7 of [[Evin Prison]] in [[Tehran]].

After some time, he sent an open letter to the judicial authorities of Iran and went again on strike which brought him the supports of international artists.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://voiceproject.org/post_news/help-us-defend-freedom-of-expression/|title=Help us step up our efforts to defend freedom of expression.
