Her second collection, [[Dart (poetry collection)|''Dart'']] (2002), combined verse and prose, and tells the story of the [[River Dart]] in Devon from a variety of perspectives. [[Jeanette Winterson]] called it a " … moving, changing poem, as fast-flowing as the river and as deep … a celebration of difference … ".<ref>{{cite news |first=Jeanette |last=Winterson |title=Alice Oswald |url=http://www.jeanettewinterson.com/pages/journalism_01/journalism_01_item.asp?journalism_01ID=95 |work=The Times |publisher=Times Newspapers Limited [article republished on the author's site] |location=London |date=27 July 2002 |accessdate=13 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120914151442/http://www.jeanettewinterson.com/pages/journalism_01/journalism_01_item.asp?journalism_01ID=95 |archivedate=14 September 2012}}</ref> ''Dart'' won the [[T.
