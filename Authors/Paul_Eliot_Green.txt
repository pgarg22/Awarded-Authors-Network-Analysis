'''Paul Eliot Green''' (March 17, 1894 – May 4, 1981) was an American [[playwright]] whose work includes historical dramas of life in North Carolina during the first decades of the twentieth century. He received the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] for his 1927 play, ''[[In Abraham's Bosom]]'', which was included in [[Burns Mantle]]'s ''The Best Plays of 1926-1927''. 

His play ''[[The Lost Colony (play)|The Lost Colony ]]'' has been regularly produced since 1937 near [[Manteo, North Carolina]], and the historic colony of Roanoke. Its success has resulted in numerous other [[Symphonic outdoor drama|historical outdoor dramas]] being produced; his work is still the longest-running. 

==Biography==
Born in [[Buies Creek, North Carolina|Buies Creek]], in [[Harnett County, North Carolina|Harnett County]], near [[Lillington, North Carolina]], Green was educated at Buies Creek Academy. (It developed as what is now known as [[Campbell University]]). He went on to study at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], where he joined the [[Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies]] and the [[PlayMakers Repertory Company#History of the Carolina Playmakers|Carolina Playmakers]]. Green also studied at [[Cornell University]].

Green first attracted attention with his 1925 one-act play ''The No 'Count Boy'', which was produced by the [[New York Theatre Club]]. The next year his full-length play ''[[In Abraham's Bosom]]'' (1926) was produced by the [[Provincetown Players]] and received the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]]. The play was considered remarkable for its depiction of [[African Americans]] in the South. Its hero, a man of [[mixed-race]] ancestry, finds his idealistic attempts to better the lives of the African Americans around him doomed to failure. With this success, Green was recognized as one of the leading regional voices in the American theatre. His plays were often compared with the folk plays of Irish playwright [[John Millington Synge]]. This included his 1926 play, ''The Last of the Lowries'', a fictional account of [[Henry Berry Lowry]], a mixed-race leader of the [[Lumbee people]] during and after the Civil War.<ref>Green, Paul.

Green's ''The [[House of Connelly]]'' was a tragedy of the decline of an old Southern family. It was chosen by the newly formed [[Group Theatre (New York)|Group Theatre]] for its inaugural production. Often compared to [[Anton Chekhov]]'s ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]'' in its contrast of aristocratic decay and parvenu energy, ''The House of Connelly'' was praised by critic [[Joseph Wood Krutch]] as Green's finest play to date.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Expressionism===
But Green had begun to shift from the realistic style of his early work. In 1928–29 he traveled to Europe on a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] and was impressed by the non-realistic productions that he saw there. He began to experiment with [[expressionism]] and the [[Epic theatre]] of [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Erwin Piscator]]. In the 1930s Green largely abandoned the New York theatre, whose commercialism he found distasteful. His experiments in non-realistic drama, ''Tread the Green Grass'' (1932) and ''Shroud My Body Down'' (1934), both premiered in Chapel Hill. They were never professionally produced in New York.

During the summer of 1936, Green, [[Cheryl Crawford]], [[Kurt Weill]] and Weill's wife [[Lotte Lenya]] rented an old house in [[Nichols, Connecticut]], near the summer rehearsal headquarters of the [[Group Theatre (New York)|Group Theatre]] at [[Pine Brook Country Club]]. Green returned to the Group Theatre to write his pacifist musical play, ''[[Johnny Johnson (musical)|Johnny Johnson]]'', with a score by Kurt Weill. In it, Green experimented with [[genre]], writing the first act as a comedy, the second as a tragedy, and the third as a satire. During this time he had an affair with [[Lotte Lenya]], which would be her first American [[affair|love affair]].<ref>''Speak Low (when you speak of love): The Letters of Kurt Weill and Lotte Lenya''</ref><ref>''A Southern Life: Letters of Paul Green, 1916–1981,'' p. 258</ref>

The production encountered problems of style early on: set designer [[Donald Oenslager]] designed the first act in poetic realism, the second in expressionism, and the final act in an extremely distorted style, director [[Lee Strasberg]] wanted to stage it realistically, and others in the company wanted it to be staged expressionistically throughout. Reviews ranged from the enthusiastic to the dismissive. The play closed after 68 performances.

===Outdoor drama===
Green created a new dramatic form that he called [[symphonic outdoor drama|symphonic drama]]. Inspired by historical events, it incorporated music and pageantry, usually for outdoor performance. His first experiment in this form was ''Roll Sweet Chariot'' (1934), which ran for four performances on Broadway. Much more warmly received was the first of his outdoor symphonic dramas, ''[[Lost Colony (play)|The Lost Colony]]'' (1937), with music by [[Lamar Stringfield]]. Based on the Lost Colony of Roanoke and produced during the [[Great Depression]], it is still produced during the summers in an outdoor theater at [[Fort Raleigh National Historic Site]] near [[Manteo, North Carolina]]. ''The Lost Colony'' is the oldest outdoor historical drama in the United States and is one of three still being performed. It has become a community institution.

Among Green's other outdoor symphonic dramas are ''Faith of Our Fathers'', ''Wilderness Road'', ''Texas'', ''[[The Common Glory]]''; ''The Founders''; and ''Trumpet in the Land'', which tells the story of the European-American massacre of Native American Christian [[Moravians]] in [[Gnadenhutten, Ohio]], during the American Revolution; ''[[Cross and Sword]]'', the state play of Florida; and ''[[The Stephen Foster Story]]'', which continues to be played each summer in [[Bardstown, Kentucky]].

==The cabin==
In 1936, Green noticed a small log cabin standing in a rural area of North Carolina―he bought it, had it taken apart, moved it, and had it put back together at his home in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]]. He then used the cabin as a writing retreat. After his death, the cabin was moved to the North Carolina Botanical Garden where it is preserved as an exhibit open to the public.<ref>[https://ncbg.unc.edu/visit/exhibits/paul-green-cabin/] "Paul Green Cabin".  North Carolina Botanical Garden Foundation website</ref>

==Other artistic endeavors==
Green also wrote screenplays: ''[[The Cabin in the Cotton]]'' (1932) and ''[[State Fair (1933 film)|State Fair]]'' (1933). He also wrote extensively on the subject of his beloved [[North Carolina]]. He helped [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]] adapt his novel ''[[Native Son]]'' for the stage in 1940.
