'''Marcel Aymé''' (29 March 1902&nbsp;– 14 October 1967) was a French [[novelist]], [[children's writer]], humorist, screenwriter and playwright.

== Biography == 
Marcel Aymé was born in [[Joigny]], in the [[Yonne]] department of [[Burgundy]]. He was educated at the ''Collège de Dole'', then worked as a journalist in Paris, among other things. His first published novel was ''Brûlebois'' (1926), and in 1929 his ''La Table aux crevés'' won the [[Prix Renaudot]]. After the great success of his novel ''La Jument verte'' (1933), translated into English as ''The Green Mare'', he concentrated mostly on writing and published children's stories, novels, and collections of stories. In 1935 he also started writing movie scripts. In theater, Marcel Aymé found success with his plays ''Lucienne et le boucher, Clérambard'' (1949), a farce, and ''Tête des autres'' (1952), which criticized the death penalty.

He died in 1967 and was buried in the [[Cimetière Saint-Vincent]] in the [[Montmartre]] Quarter of [[Paris]].

== Work ==
One of Aymé's most famous short stories is "Le Passe-Muraille" or "The Walker-Through-Walls". A statue in Paris features the story's main character, Dutilleul. At the age of 42, Dutilleul suddenly discovers that he has "the remarkable gift of being able to pass through walls with perfect ease". What begins as a novelty that gives him pleasure ends up pushing Dutilleul toward ever more sinister pursuits.

== Legacy ==
His works have inspired a number of movies, television shows, songs and comic strips.

Visitors to Paris can see a monument in his honor at Place Marcel-Aymé, in the Montmartre Quarter. The statue is based upon his short story "Le passe-muraille" ("The Walker through Walls").
