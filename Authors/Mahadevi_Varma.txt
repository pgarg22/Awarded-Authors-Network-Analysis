'''Mahadevi Varma''' ({{lang-hi|महादेवी वर्मा}}), (26 March 1907 – 11 September 1987) was an Indian [[Hindi]]-language poet, essayist, sketch story writer and an eminent personality of Hindi literature. She is considered one of the four major pillars{{efn|The other three pillars of Chhayavad are [[Jaishankar Prasad]], [[Suryakant Tripathi|Suryakant Tripathi ''Nirala'']] and [[Sumitranandan Pant]].}} of the ''[[Chhayavaad|Chhayawadi]]'' era in [[Hindi literature]].{{sfn|Varma|1985|p=38-40}} She has been also addressed as the Modern [[Meera]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ranu |first1=Anjali |title=Mahadevi Verma: Modern Meera |url=http://literaryindia.com/Literature/Indian-Authors/mahadevi-verma.html |publisher=Literary India |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070321205859/http://literaryindia.com/Literature/Indian-Authors/mahadevi-verma.html |access-date=5 December 2020|archive-date=21 March 2007 }} Archived from the [http://literaryindia.com/Literature/Indian-Authors/mahadevi-verma.html original] on 21 September 2007</ref> Poet [[Suryakant Tripathi|Nirala]] had once called her "Saraswati in the vast temple of Hindi Literature".{{efn|हिंदी के विशाल मन्दिर की वीणापाणी, स्फूर्ति चेतना रचना की प्रतिमा कल्याणी (English translation: Veenapani{{sup| Another name of Goddess Saraswati}} in huge temple of Hindi having a stature in conscious creations) - [[Suryakant Tripathi|''Nirala'']].}}  Varma had witnessed [[India]] both before and after independence.

She developed a soft vocabulary in the Hindi poetry of [[:hi:खड़ीबोली|Khadi Boli]], which before her was considered possible only in [[Braj bhasha]]. For this, she chose the soft words of [[Sanskrit]] and [[Bangla (language)|Bangla]] and adapted to Hindi. She was well-versed in music.

== Life ==
=== Early life ===
Varma was born on 26 March 1907{{sfn|Singh|2007|p=39-40}} in a Hindu [[Kayastha]] family of [[Farrukhabad]], Uttar Pradesh, India.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Schomer|first=Karine|url=https://www.google.co.in/books/edition/_/TerrwAEACAAJ?hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjg9oid0-fwAhV1meYKHb_XBlgQ8fIDMBJ6BAgGEAM|title=Mahadevi Varma and the Chhayavad Age of Modern Hindi Poetry|publisher=University of California Press|year=1983|isbn=9780520042551|location=Berkeley|pages=}}</ref> Her father Govind Prasad Varma was a professor in a college in Bhagalpur. Her mother's name was Hem Rani Devi. Her mother was a  religious, passionate and vegetarian woman with a keen interest in music.{{sfn|Singh|2007|p=39-40}} Her mother would recite for many hours of [[Ramayana]], [[Gita]] and ''Vinay magazine''. On the contrary, her father was a scholar, music lover, atheist, a hunting enthusiast and a cheerful person. [[Sumitranandan Pant]] and [[Suryakant Tripathi|Suryakant Tripathi ''Nirala'']] were close friends of Mahadevi Varma.<ref>{{cite web |title=जो रेखाएँ कह न सकेंगी- महादेवी वर्मा |url=http://www.abhivyakti-hindi.org/sansmaran/2004/jo_rekhayen.htm |website=www.abhivyakti-hindi.org |publisher=Abhivyakti |access-date=7 December 2020|language=hi}}</ref> It is said that for 40 years Varma kept tying [[Raksha Bandhan|Rakhis]] to [[Suryakant Tripathi|Nirala]].{{sfn|Pandeya|2020|p=10}}

=== Education ===
Varma was originally admitted to a [[Convent]] school, but upon protests and an unwilling attitude, she took admission in Crosthwaite Girls College at Allahabad.<ref name="a"/> According to Varma, she learned the strength of unity while staying in the hostel at Crosthwaite. Here students of different religions lived together. Varma started to write poems secretly; but upon discovery of her hidden stash of poems by her roommate and senior [[Subhadra Kumari Chauhan]] (known in the school for writing poems), her hidden talent was exposed.{{sfn|Anantharam|2010|p=4-8}}

{{Quote|While others used to play outside, me and Subhadra used to sit on a tree and let our creative thoughts flow together...She used to write in [[Khariboli]], and soon I also started to write in Khariboli...this way, we used to write one or two poems a day... |Mahadevi Varma|''Smrti Chitra (Memory Sketch)'' <small>English Translation</small><ref>{{cite book |last1=Varmā |first1=Mahādevī |title=Smr̥ti citra |date=1973 |publisher=Rājakamala Prakāśana |url=https://www.google.co.in/books/edition/Smr%CC%A5ti_citra/1cUSAAAAMAAJ |access-date=7 December 2020 |language=hi}}</ref>}}

She and Subhadra also used to send poems to publications such as weekly magazines and managed to get some of their poems published. Both the budding poets also attended [[Kavi sammelan|poetry seminars]], where they met eminent Hindi poets, and read out their poems to the audience. This partnership continued till Subhrada graduated from Crosthwaite.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/gk-current-affairs/story/mahadevi-varma-314852-2016-03-26|title=Mahadevi Varma: The woman who began the era of romanticism in Hindi literature|website=India Today|access-date=19 May 2018}}</ref>

Her grandfather reportedly had the ambition of making her a scholar; although he insisted that she comply with tradition and marry at the age of nine.<ref name="Book"/> Her mother was fluent both in [[Sanskrit]] and [[Hindi]], and very religious pious lady.

Following her graduation in 1929, Mahadevi absolutely refused to go and live with her husband Swarup Narain Varma  because they were incompatible.

In ''Hindu Stree Ka Patnitva'' (The Wifehood of Hindu Women) marriage is compared to slavery. Not being affiliated to any political or financial authority, she writes, women are assigned to lives of being wives and mothers. Her feminism is often overshadowed by her poetic persona. Through poems like ''Cha'', she explored themes and ideas of female sexuality, while her short stories such as ''Bibia'', discusses the subject of experiences of women physical and mental abuse.{{sfn|Anantharam|2010|p=20}}

She spent most of her life in [[Allahabad]] (Prayagraj) of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. She died in Allahabad on 11 September 1987.<ref>{{cite web |title=30 Years After Her Death, Hindi Poet Mahadevi Varma Served Tax Notice |url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/hindi-poet-mahadevi-varma-served-tax-notice-30-years-after-her-death-1810227 |website=NDTV.com}}</ref>

== Critical Analysis ==
A section of critics are those who believe that the poetry of Mahadevi is very personal. Her agony, anguish, compassion, is artificial.

Moral critics like [[Ramchandra Shukla]] have put a question mark on the truth of her anguish and feelings. He quotes {{quote|With regard to this anguish, she has revealed such sensations of heart, which are extraterrestrial. As far as these sensations are concerned and how far the sensations are real, nothing cannot be said. <small>(English translation)</small><ref>{{cite web |title=काव्यखंड (संवत् 1975) प्रकरण 4 नई धारा : तृतीय उत्थान : वर्तमान काव्यधाराएँ |url=https://hindisamay.com/Alochana/shukl%20granthavali5/itihas%20shukl14a.htm |publisher=Hindisamay.com |access-date=7 December 2020| language=hi}}</ref>}} On the other hand [[Hazari Prasad Dwivedi]] consider her poetry to be a collective criterion.{{efn|The truth is that Mahadevi's outlook goes from person to person. The world's well-being is rooted in her pain, anguish, compassion and sadism (English translation)- [[Hazari Prasad Dwivedi]]}} Poetic works like ''Deep'' from (Nihar), ''Madhur Madhur Mere Deepak Jal'' from (Neerja) and ''Mome Sa Tan Gal Hai'', concludes that these poems not only explain Mahadevi's self-centerness but also to be considered a representative form of general posture and texture of her poems. Satyaprakash Mishra says about her philosophy of metaphysics related to cinematography - {{Quote|Mahadevi did not only differentiate and distinguish from the earlier poetry of the object craft of Shadowism and Mysticism by virtue of rationalism and examples, but also showed in what sense it is human. There is poetry of change of sensation and newness of expression. She did not accuse anyone of sentiment, adoration etc. but only described the nature, character, appearance and uniqueness of Chhayavad. <small>(English translation)</small><ref>{{cite web |last1=Mishra |first1=Satya Prakash |title=महादेवी का सर्जन : प्रतिरोध और करुणा |url=http://www.tadbhav.com/Mahadevi%20ka.htm |publisher=Tadbhav.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922133831/http://www.tadbhav.com/Mahadevi%20ka.htm |access-date=7 December 2020|archive-date=22 September 2007 | language=hi}} Archived from the [http://www.tadbhav.com/Mahadevi%20ka.htm original] on 22 September 2007</ref>}}

American novelist [[David Rubin (author)|David Rubin]] had said the following about her works 
{{quote|What arrests us in Mahadevi's work is the striking originality of the voice and the technical ingenuity which enabled her to create in her series of mostly quite short lyrics throughout her five volumes a consistently evolving representation of total subjectivity measured against the vastness of cosmic nature with nothing, as it were, intervening—no human social relationships, no human activities beyond those totally metaphorical ones involving weeping, walking the road, playing the [[Veena]], etc.<ref name="Book"/>}}

Prabhakar Shrotriya believe that those who consider her a poetess of anguish and despair do not know how much fire there is in that suffering which exposes the truth of life. He says {{quote|In fact, the center of Mahadevi's experience and creation is fire, not tears. What is visible is not the ultimate truth, what is invisible is the original or inspiring truth. These tears are not the tears of easy simple anguish,  but how much fire goes behind them, the thunder-storm, the electric roar of the cloud, and the rebellion is hidden.<br><small>(English translation)</small><ref>{{cite book |last1=Kukreti |first1=Hemant |title=Navjagrankaleen Kaviyon Kee Pahchan (Literary Criticism) |year=2017 |publisher=Vāṇī Prakāśana |isbn=978-93-87155-00-8 |page=133 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ee5EDwAAQBAJ |language=hi}}</ref>}} It is true that Varma's poetic world comes under the shadow of Chhayavaad (shadowism), but to see her poetry completely unconnected to her era, one would be doing injustice to her. Mahadevi was also a conscious writer. During the Bengal famine in 1973, she had published a poetry collection and also wrote a poem called "''Banga Bhu Shanth Vandana''" related to Bengal.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Verma |first1=Mahadevi |title=Agnirekha |date=September 2009 |publisher=Rajkamal Prakashan |isbn=978-81-7178-933-7 |page=48 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yr0WnBKGACwC |language=hi}}</ref> Similarly, in response to the invasion of China, she had edited a collection of poems called ''Himalaya''.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kumar |first1=Kuldeep |title=Rebel with a cause |url=https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/rebel-with-a-cause/article23446939.ece |work=The Hindu |date=6 April 2018}}</ref>

==Literary contributions==

[[File:Mahadevi Verma (group photo).jpg|thumb|Mahadevi Varma (''bottom row third from left'') along with [[Hazari Prasad Dwivedi]] and others]]

The emergence of Mahadevi Varma in literature happened at a time when the shape of [[:hi:खड़ीबोली|Khadi Boli]] was being refined. She introduced [[Braj bhasha]] softness to Hindi poetry. She gave us a repository of songs with a heartfelt acceptance to Indian philosophy. In this way, she did an important work in the three fields of language, literature and philosophy which later influenced an entire generation. She created a unique rhythm and simplicity in the composition and language of her songs, as well as natural use of symbols and images that draw a picture in the mind of the reader.<ref>Paliwal, Krishnadatta (2007). ''आजकल'' (monthly magazine) . CGO Complex, Lodi road, New Delhi-110 003: Publications Division, Information Bhawan. Page 15</ref> Her contribution to the prosperity of Chhayavadi poetry is very important. While [[Jaishankar Prasad]] gave naturalization to the [[Chhayavaad|Chhayavadi]] poetry, [[Suryakant Tripathi|Suryakant Tripathi ''Nirala'']] embodied the liberation in it and [[Sumitranandan Pant]] brought the art of delicateness, but Varma embodied life to the Chhayavadi poetry. The most prominent feature of her poetry is emotionalism and intensity of feeling. Such lively and tangible manifestation of the subtlest subtle expressions of the heart makes 'Varma' among the best [[Chhayavaad|Chhayavadi]] poets.<ref>Vanzpe, Prof. Shubhada (2006). ''Pushpak (Semi-Annual Magazine)'' Issue-6 . Hyderabad, India: Kadambini Club. Page 113.</ref> She is remembered with respect for her speeches in Hindi. Her speeches were full of compassion for the common man and firm of truth. At 3rd [[World Hindi Conference]], 1983, Delhi, she was the chief guest of the closing ceremony.<ref>{{cite web |title=समापन समारोह है, तो मन भारी है - तीसरे विश्व हिंदी सम्मेलन |url=http://www.vishwahindi.com/mahadeviji.htm |website=www.vishwahindi.com |publisher=Hindi section, MEA, Government of India |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008182938/http://www.vishwahindi.com/mahadeviji.htm |access-date=7 December 2020|archive-date=8 October 2007 }} Archived from the [http://www.vishwahindi.com/mahadeviji.htm original] on 8 October 2007</ref>

Apart from the original creations, she was also a creative translator with works like in her translation ' ''Saptaparna'' ' (1980). With the help of her cultural consciousness, she has presented 39 selected important pieces of Hindi poetry in her work by establishing the identity of [[Vedas]], [[Ramayana]], [[Theragatha]] and the works of [[Aśvaghoṣa|Ashwaghosh]], [[Kālidāsa|Kalidas]], [[Bhavabhuti]] and [[Jayadeva]]. At the beginning, in the 61-page ' ''Apna Baat'' ', she has given a thorough research in relation to this invaluable heritage of Indian wisdom and literature, which enriches the overall thinking and fine writing of Hindi, not just limited female writing.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sharma |first1=Rishabhdev |title=भारतीय चिंतन परंपरा और 'सप्तपर्णा' |url=http://m.sahityakunj.net/entries/view/bhartiya-chintan-parmpara-aur-saptparnaa |website=m.sahityakunj.net |publisher=Sahitya Kunj |access-date=7 December 2020 | language=hi}}</ref>
