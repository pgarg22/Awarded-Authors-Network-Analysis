'''József Kossics''', also known in [[Slovene language|Slovene]] as '''Jožef Košič''' (around October 9, 1788, [[Bogojina]], [[Austria-Hungary]] – December 26, 1867, [[Felsőszölnök]]), was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-[[Slovenia]]n writer, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] priest, ethnologist, linguist, poet, and historian.

Kossics was born in Bogojina, [[Moravske Toplice]], then part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], now in [[Slovenia]]. His father József Kossics was a teacher born in [[Varaždin]] and his mother Ana Kregar was from a petty noble family.

Kossics served as a priest in the first half of the 19th century in [[Alsószölnök]] and later in [[Felsőszölnök]] (1829–1867) in [[Vas|Vas country]]. He was also a poet, linguist, historian, and ethnologist. He was a subscriber to the early Hungarian scholarly journal ''Tudományos gyűjtemény'' (Scientific Collection, 1817–1841). In 1828, his monograph on the [[Hungarian Slovenes]] appeared in this journal, earning him respect in ethnological circles. Kossics continued to attentively follow developments in [[Hungary|Hungarian]] science and culture.

In his pursuit of promoting the special features of ethnic groups, he later became something of an activist. In 1837, he joined an appeal for a poem from every ethnic group living in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] to be read in the respective languages for the opening of the [[National Theatre (Budapest)|Hungarian National Theater]] in [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]]. For this purpose, Kossics himself wrote a poem in his native Slovene and added a rough Hungarian translation.

Kossics died in 1867 in [[Felsőszölnök]].
