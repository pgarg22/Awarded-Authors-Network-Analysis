'''Coleman Barks''' (born April 23, 1937) is an [[United States|American]] [[poet]], and former literature faculty at the [[University of Georgia]]. Although he neither speaks nor reads [[Persian language|Persian]], he is a popular [[interpreter]] of [[Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Balkhi-Rumi|Rumi]], rewriting the poems based on other [[English language|English]] translations. His "translations" are therefore controversial. 

==Early life and education==
Barks is a native of [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. He attended the [[Baylor School]] as a teenager, then studied collegiately at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]] and the [[University of California, Berkeley]].{{cn|date=October 2021}}

Barks was a student of the Sufi [[Sheikh (Sufism)|Shaykh]] [[Bawa Muhaiyaddeen]].<ref>[https://www.thesunmagazine.org/issues/382/walking-around-in-the-heart/ "Walking Around In The Heart
Coleman Barks On Rumi, Sensuality, And The Path With No Name"], ''[[The Sun (magazine)]]'', October 2007</ref>

==Career==
Barks taught literature at the [[University of Georgia]] for three decades.

Barks makes frequent international appearances and is well known throughout the [[Middle East]]. Barks' work has contributed to an extremely strong following of Rumi in the English-speaking world.<ref>[http://usembassy.state.gov/posts/in1/wwwhspmayjune9.html Persian Poet Conquers America] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622114625/http://usembassy.state.gov/posts/in1/wwwhspmayjune9.html |date=2007-06-22 }}</ref> Due to his work, the ideas of [[Sufism]] have crossed many cultural boundaries over the past few decades. Barks received an honorary doctorate from [[Tehran University]] in 2006.<ref>[http://www.payvand.com/news/06/may/1067.html Iran News report]</ref>

He has also read his original [[poetry]] at the [[Geraldine R. Dodge Poetry Festival]]. In March 2009, Barks was inducted to the Georgia Writers' Hall of Fame.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.libs.uga.edu/gawriters/page/honorees.html|title = Georgia Writers Hall of Fame}}</ref>

==Personal life==
He currently lives in [[Athens, Georgia]], where he interprets the writings of Rumi and composes poetry of his own. In early 2011, Barks suffered a stroke that has somewhat impaired his speech and has resulted in at least one cancelled appearance.<ref>http://donshare.blogspot.com/2011/03/message-from-coleman-barks.html</ref>

==Rumi interpretations==
Barks has published several volumes of his interpretations of Rumi's poetry since 1976, including ''The Hand of Poetry, Five Mystic Poets of Persia'' in 1993, ''The Essential Rumi'' in 1995, ''The Book of Love'' in 2003 and ''A Year with Rumi'' in 2006.

=== Criticism ===
Barks does not speak or read [[Persian language|Persian]]; his 'translations' are therefore technically [[paraphrase]]s. Barks bases his paraphrases entirely on other [[English language|English]] translations of Rumi which include renderings by John Moyne and [[Reynold A. Nicholson]].<ref>Coleman Barks, The Essential Rumi: New Expanded Edition (Harper Collins Publishers, 2004), "On the more literal level, the texts I work from to produce these poems are unpublished translations done by John Moyne, Emeritus Head of Linguistics at the City University of New York, and the following translations by Reynold Nicholson and A. J. Arberry, the famous Cambridge Islamicists..." (p. 365)</ref> In addition, while the original Persian poetry of Rumi is heavily rhymed and metered, Barks has used primarily free verse. In some instances, he will also skip or mix lines and metaphors from different poems into one 'translation'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dar-al-masnavi.blogspot.com/2012/02/dar-al-masnavi-question-about.html|title = Blogger}}</ref> 

For example, here is a very literal rendering by [[Reynold A. Nicholson]]:

<blockquote><poem>
On the Day of Resurrection every hidden thing will be made manifest: every sinner will be ignominiously exposed by himself.
His hands and feet will give evidence and declare his iniquity in the presence of Him whose help is sought.
His hand will say, 'I have stolen such and such'; his lip will say, 'I have asked such and such questions';
His foot will say. 'I have gone to (enjoy) things desired'; his pudendum will say, 'I have committed fornication.'
His eye will say, 'I have cast amorous glances at things forbidden'; his ear will say, 'I have gathered evil words.'
Therefore he is a lie from head to foot, for even his own members give him the lie,
Just as, in (the case of) the specious prayers (performed by the ascetic), their fine appearance was proved to be false testimonio testiculi.
Act, then, in such wise that the action itself, without (your) tongue (uttering a word), will be (equivalent to) saying 'I testify' and (to making) the most explicit declaration,
So that your whole body, limb by limb, O son, will have said 'I testify' as regards both good and ill.
The slave's walking behind his master is a testimony (equivalent to saying), 'I am subject to authority and this man is my lord.'<ref>Reynold A. Nicholson (translator), The Mathnawi of Jalalu'din Rumi, Book V, verses 2211-2220, p. 133 (E. J. W. Gibb Memorial Trust 1926, Reprinted 2001)</ref></poem></blockquote>

And Barks' version of the same passage:

<blockquote><poem>
On Resurrection Day your body testifies against you.
Your hand says, 'I stole money.'
Your lips, 'I said meanness.'
Your feet, 'I went where I shouldn't.'
Your genitals, 'Me Too.'

They will make your praying sound hypocritical
Let the body's doings speak openly now,
without your saying a word,
as a student's walking behind a teacher
says, "This one knows more clearly
than I the way.<ref>Coleman Barks, The Essential Rumi: New Expanded Edition, (Harper Collins Publishers, 2004), p. 111</ref></poem></blockquote>

Barks' translations have been criticized by many Persian scholars. [[Majid Naficy]] writes that Coleman Barks reduces Rumi's poetry to a [[New Age]] text: {{quote|The essential problem of Coleman Barks lies in the fact that in his version he intentionally changes Rumi... He approaches Rumi's poetry as sacred texts, which need to be dusted from the passage of times by a touched devotee and prepared for the Post Modern, New Age market in the West. The New Age movement finds a remedy for modern alienation in old recipes, such as horoscope, Extra-Sensory Perception and divination...  In order to remodel and fix Rumi for the American market Barks follows the path of a New-Age sufi. He tries to disconnect the mystical concepts of Rumi from their historical and social backgrounds and modify them for our contemporary taste... The falsification and misrepresentation of Rumi's fundamental concepts is not limited to Love and spreads to other ideas such as "wine", "master" and "Jesus".<ref>[http://iranian.com/NaficyMajid/2006/December/Barks/Images/Barks.pdf Coleman Barks and Rumi's Donkey], The Iranian, December 13, 2005, by Majid Naficy</ref>}}

==Original poetry==
Barks has published several volumes of his own poetry, including ''Gourd Seed'', "Quickly Aging Here", ''Tentmaking'', and, in 2001, ''Granddaughter Poems'', a collection of Coleman's poetry about his granddaughter, Briny Barks, with illustrations by Briny. Harper published his first book of poetry, ''The Juice'', in 1972.
