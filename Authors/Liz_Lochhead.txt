It is often claimed that at this time Lochhead was part of a [[Philip Hobsbaum]] writers' group, a crucible of creative activity – with other members including [[Alasdair Gray]], [[James Kelman]], [[Tom Leonard (poet)|Tom Leonard]], [[Aonghas MacNeacail]] and [[Jeff Torrington]],<ref>Peter Childs and Michael Storry (eds), ''The Encyclopedia of Contemporary British Culture''. Routledge: 2009, p.311.</ref> Liz Lochhead has repeatedly claimed this to be an invention.<ref name="auto1"/> She has however recalled the support and inspiration she drew from the Scottish poetry scene of the early 1970s and  meetings with the elder generation - [[Norman MacCaig]], [[Edwin Morgan (poet)|Edwin Morgan]], [[Robert Garioch]] - and with contemporaries such as Leonard, Kelman and Gray.<ref>{{cite web|title = Liz Lochhead on the 40th anniversary of Memo For Spring|url = http://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/connect/podcast/liz-lochhead-40th-anniversary-memo-spring|website = Scottish Poetry Library|access-date = 2016-01-25}}</ref> Lochhead went on to produce revue shows with Leonard and Gray, including Tickly Mince,<ref>{{cite web|title = The Glasgow Herald - Google News Archive Search|url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&dat=19820415&id=LPo9AAAAIBAJ&pg=2962,2992335&hl=en|website = news.google.com|access-date = 2016-01-25}}</ref> and The Pie of Damocles.<ref>{{cite web|title = Sorcha Dallas · Works · Alasdair Gray, 'The Pie of Damocles' (Merryhell Theatre), 1983 · Images|url = http://www.sorchadallas.com/works/3571/images|website = www.sorchadallas.com|access-date = 2016-01-25}}</ref> Other the following years Lochhead published further collections ''Islands'' (1978) and ''The Grimm Sisters'' (1979) and moved first to Toronto as part of the first Scottish/Canadian writers exchange and later made her home in New York.<ref name="auto3"/> In 1986 she returned permanently to Glasgow.<ref name="auto3"/>

Lochhead's success in poetry was rivalled by her writing for the theatre.<ref name="auto3"/> Her plays include ''Blood and Ice'' (1982), ''[[Mary Queen of Scots Got Her Head Chopped Off]]'' (1987), ''Perfect Days'' (2000) and a highly acclaimed adaptation into Scots of [[Molière]]'s ''[[Tartuffe]]'' (1985).

| [[Helen Simpson (author)|Helen Simpson]]'s satirical and poignant short story, dramatised for radio by Liz Lochhead. Nicola Beaumont (English, partner in a law firm, mother of four) reluctantly sits down to a long-winded corporate Burns Supper. At first impatient with the whisky-fuelled pomposity around her, Nicola finds herself surprisingly moved as the traditional rituals of a Burns Night unfold. What she comes to learn about the eighteenth-century Scots poet brings new self-knowledge and helps her through the night's violent emotions and climactic events.
