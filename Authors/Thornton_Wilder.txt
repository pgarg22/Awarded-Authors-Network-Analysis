Wilder had four siblings as well as a twin who was stillborn.<ref>[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/01/07/man-of-letters-5 Man of Letters: The Case of Thornton Wilder] By Robert Gottlieb, December 31, 2012 Published in print in the column A Critic at Large in the January 7, 2013, issue of ''The New Yorker''.

Thornton's older brother, [[Amos Wilder|Amos Niven Wilder]], became Hollis Professor of Divinity at the [[Harvard Divinity School]]. Amos Wilder was a noted poet and was instrumental in developing the field of [[theopoetics]]. Their sister [[Isabel Wilder]] was an accomplished writer. They had two more sisters, [[Charlotte Wilder]], a poet, and [[Janet Wilder Dakin]], a zoologist.<ref>{{cite book |last=Niven |first=Penelope |title=Thornton Wilder: A Life |publisher=Harper |year=2012 |pages=92, 370}}</ref>

==Education==
[[File:Thornton Wilder Yale graduation photo 1920.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Wilder in his [[Yale College]] graduation [[photograph|photo]] (1920)]]

Wilder began writing plays while at the [[The Thacher School|Thacher School]] in [[Ojai, California]], where he did not fit in and was teased by classmates as overly [[intellectual]]. According to a classmate, "We left him alone, just left him alone. And he would retire at the library, his hideaway, learning to distance himself from humiliation and indifference." His family lived for a time in China, where his sister Janet was born in 1910. He attended the English [[China Inland Mission]] [[Chefoo School]] at [[Yantai]] but returned with his mother and siblings to California in 1912 because of the unstable political conditions in China at the time.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/issue/2008-12-18/article/31842?headline=Thornton-Wilder-on-the-South-Side-of-Our-Town |title=Thornton Wilder on the South Side of Our Town |newspaper=[[The Berkeley Daily Planet]] |first=Phil |last=McArdle |date=December 17, 2008}}</ref> Thornton graduated from [[Berkeley High School (California)|Berkeley High School]] in 1915.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thorntonwilder.com/about-wilder/biography/|title=Biography|website=Thornton Wilder|language=en-US|access-date=January 10, 2018}}</ref>

After having served a three-month enlistment in the Army's [[Coast Artillery Corps]] at [[Fort Adams]], Rhode Island, in [[World War I]] (rising to the rank of [[corporal]]), he attended [[Oberlin College]] before earning his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1920 at [[Yale University]], where he refined his writing skills as a member of the [[Alpha Delta Phi]] fraternity, a literary society. He earned his [[Master of Arts]] degree in French literature from [[Princeton University]] in 1926.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.twildersociety.org/biography/chronology/ |title=Chronology |website=Thornton Wilder Society |access-date=July 14, 2017}}</ref>

==Career==
After graduating, Wilder went to Italy and studied [[archaeology]] and Italian (1920–21) as part of an eight-month residency at [[The American Academy in Rome]], and then taught French at the [[Lawrenceville School]] in [[Lawrenceville, New Jersey]], beginning in 1921.<ref name=marg/> His first novel, [https://www.thorntonwilder.com/the-cabala-and-the-woman-of-andros ''The Cabala''], was published in 1926. In 1927, ''[[The Bridge of San Luis Rey]]'' brought him commercial success and his first [[Pulitzer Prize]] (1928).<ref name=pulitzernovel/> He resigned from the Lawrenceville School in 1928. From 1930 to 1937 he taught at the [[University of Chicago]], during which time he published his translation of André Obey's own adaptation of the tale "Le Viol de Lucrece" (1931) under the title "Lucrece" (Longmans Green, 1933).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theatermania.com/new-york-city-theater/reviews/05-2000/lucrece_714.html |title=Lucrece |first1=Barbara |last1=Siegel |first2=Scott |last2=Siegel |date=May 22, 2000 |work=TheaterMania.com}}</ref> In Chicago, he became famous as a lecturer and was chronicled on the celebrity pages.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Jones |first=Chris |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/books/ct-prj-1223-thornton-wilder-20121228-column.html |title=Our town was Wilder's town too |work=Chicago Tribune |access-date=February 13, 2020}}</ref> In 1938 he won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] for his play ''[[Our Town]]'', and he won the prize again in 1943 for his play ''[[The Skin of Our Teeth]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-category/218 |title=Drama – The Pulitzer Prizes |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2017 |website=Pulitzer |publisher=Columbia University |access-date=April 27, 2017 }}</ref>

[[World War II]] saw Wilder rise to the rank of [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] in the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Force]] Intelligence, first in Africa, then in Italy until 1945. He received several awards for his military service.<ref group=fn>The American [[Legion of Merit]] and [[Bronze Star]], ''Chevalier'' of the ''[[Legion d'Honneur]]'' from France, and an honorary [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) from Britain.</ref> He went on to be a visiting professor at [[Harvard University]], where he served for a year as the [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures|Charles Eliot Norton professor]]. Though he considered himself a teacher first and a writer second, he continued to write all his life, receiving the [[Peace Prize of the German Book Trade]] in 1957 and the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 1963. In 1968 he won the [[National Book Award]] for his novel ''The Eighth Day''.<ref>[https://www.thorntonwilder.com/the-eighth-day] The Wilder Family Website</ref><ref name=nba1968/>

''The Bridge of San Luis Rey'' (1927) tells the story of several unrelated people who happen to be on a bridge in [[Peru]] when it collapses, killing them. Philosophically, the book explores the question of why unfortunate events occur to people who seem "innocent" or "undeserving". It won the Pulitzer Prize<ref name=NYT/> in 1928, and in 1998 it was selected by the editorial board of the American Modern Library as one of the 100 best novels of the twentieth century. The book was quoted by [[British Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] during the memorial service for victims of the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001.<ref>{{cite news |title=Text of Tony Blair's reading in New York |place=London, UK |newspaper=The Guardian |date=September 21, 2001 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/sep/21/september11.usa11 |access-date=June 3, 2009}}</ref> Since then its popularity has grown enormously.{{or|date=January 2021}} The book is the progenitor of the modern disaster epic in literature and [[disaster film|film-making]], where a single disaster intertwines the victims, whose lives are then explored by means of flashbacks to events before the disaster.{{Citation needed|date = April 2017}}

Wilder wrote ''[[Our Town]]'', a popular play (and later film) set in fictional Grover's Corners, New Hampshire. It was inspired in part by [[Dante Alighieri|Dante's]] ''Purgatorio''<ref>Breyer, Jackson R. editor. Rojcewicz, Stephen. "Our Tears: Lacrimae Rerum and Thorton Wilder".

''Thornton Wilder and the Puritan Narrative Tradition''. University of Missouri Press (2006). pp. 7–10. {{ISBN|978-0-8262-6497-8}}</ref> Wilder suffered from [[writer's block]] while writing the final act. ''Our Town'' employs a choric narrator called the [[Stage manager|Stage Manager]] and a [[minimalism|minimalist]] set to underscore the human experience. Wilder himself played the Stage Manager on Broadway for two weeks and later in [[summer stock]] productions. Following the daily lives of the Gibbs and Webb families, as well as the other inhabitants of Grover's Corners, the play illustrates the importance of the universality of the simple, yet meaningful lives of all people in the world in order to demonstrate the value of appreciating life. The play won the 1938 Pulitzer Prize.<ref name=pulitzerdrama/>

[[File:Thornton Wilder (1948).jpg|thumb|left|Wilder as Mr. Antrobus in ''The Skin of Our Teeth'', 1948]]
In 1938, [[Max Reinhardt]] directed a Broadway production of ''[[The Merchant of Yonkers]]'', which Wilder had adapted from [[Austria]]n playwright [[Johann Nestroy]]'s ''[[Einen Jux will er sich machen]]'' (1842). It was a failure, closing after 39 performances.<ref>{{cite book |last=Niven |first=Penelope |title=Thornton Wilder: A Life |publisher=Harper |year=2012 |page=471}}</ref>

His play ''[[The Skin of Our Teeth]]'' opened in New York on November 18, 1942, featuring [[Fredric March]] and [[Tallulah Bankhead]]. Again, the themes are familiar – the timeless human condition; history as progressive, cyclical, or entropic; literature, philosophy, and religion as the touchstones of civilization. Three acts dramatize the travails of the Antrobus family, allegorizing the [[alternate history]] of mankind. It was claimed by Joseph Campbell and Henry Morton Robinson, authors of ''[[A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake]]'', that much of the play was the result of unacknowledged borrowing from [[James Joyce]]'s last work.<ref group=fn>[[Joseph Campbell]] and [[Henry Morton Robinson]] published a pair of reviews-cum-denunciations entitled "The Skin of ''Whose'' Teeth?" in the ''[[Saturday Review (US magazine)|Saturday Review]]'' immediately after the play's debut; these created a huge uproar at the time. Campbell's {{cite book |title=Mythic Worlds, Modern Words |year=2004 |location=Novato, California |publisher=[[New World Library]] |pages=257–266 |isbn=978-1-57731-406-6 |mode=cs2}} reprints the reviews and discusses the controversy.</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Pathways to Bliss |first=Joseph |last=Campbell |year=2005 |location=Novato, California |publisher=[[New World Library]] |pages=[https://archive.org/details/pathwaystoblissm00camp/page/121 121–123] |isbn=978-1-57731-471-4 |url=https://archive.org/details/pathwaystoblissm00camp/page/121 }}</ref>

In his novel ''[[The Ides of March (novel)|The Ides of March]]'' (1948), Wilder reconstructed the characters and events leading to, and culminating in, the assassination of [[Julius Caesar]]. He had met [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] on a U.S. lecture tour after the war, and was under the influence of [[existentialism]], although rejecting its [[atheist]] implications.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Art of Thornton Wilder |url=https://archive.org/details/artofthorntonwil0000gold |url-access=registration |first=Malcolm |last=Goldstein |year=1965 |location=Lincoln |publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]] |pages=[https://archive.org/details/artofthorntonwil0000gold/page/19 19–20] |isbn=978-0-80320-057-9}}</ref>
[[File:Thornton-Wilder-TIME-1953.jpg|thumb|Thornton Wilder on the cover of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] – January 12, 1953]]
In 1954, [[Tyrone Guthrie]] encouraged Wilder to rework ''The Merchant of Yonkers'' into ''[[The Matchmaker]]''. This time the play opened in 1955 and enjoyed a healthy Broadway run of 486 performances with [[Ruth Gordon]] in the title role, winning a [[Tony Award]] for Guthrie, its director. It became the basis for the hit 1964 musical ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'', with a book by [[Michael Stewart (playwright)|Michael Stewart]] and score by [[Jerry Herman]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.indielondon.co.uk/Theatre-Review/hello-dolly-new-wimbledon-theatre-review |title=Hello Dolly! – New Wimbledon Theatre (Review) |work=indielondon.co.uk |date=March 2008}}</ref>

In 1962 and 1963, Wilder lived twenty months in the small town of [[Douglas, Arizona]], apart from family and friends. There he started his longest novel, ''The Eighth Day'', which went on to win the [[National Book Award]].<ref name=nba1968/> According to Harold Augenbraum in 2009, it "attack[ed] the big questions head on, ... [embedded] in the story of small-town America".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbafictionblog.org/nba-winning-books-blog/1968.html |last=Augenbraum |first=Harold |title=1968: The Eighth Day by Thornton Wilder |date=July 23, 2009 |work=National Book Foundation |access-date=March 28, 2012}}</ref>

His last novel, ''[[Theophilus North]]'', was published in 1973, and made into the film ''[[Mr. North]]'' in 1988.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.mcall.com/1988-11-17/entertainment/2663609_1_john-huston-danny-huston-anjelica-huston |title=With 'Mr. North,' Danny Huston Gets His Bearings As A Director |date=November 17, 1988 |first=Amy |last=Longsdorf |work=The Morning Call}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Wilder never discussed being homosexual publicly or in his writings. Six years after Wilder’s death, the pornographer [[Samuel Steward]] wrote in his autobiography that he had had sexual relations with him.<ref>The Lost Autobiography of Samuel Steward: Recollections of an Extraordinary Twentieth-Century Gay Life, edited by Jeremy Mulderig, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2018, pages 118–124</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Gottlieb |first1=Robert |title=Man of Letters |magazine=The New Yorker |date=January 7, 2013 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/01/07/man-of-letters-5 |access-date=June 17, 2017}}</ref> Wilder was introduced to Steward by [[Gertrude Stein]], who at the time regularly corresponded with both of them. The third act of ''Our Town'' was allegedly drafted after a long walk, during a brief affair with Steward in [[Zürich, Switzerland]].<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Steward |editor-first=Samuel |last1=Stein |first1=Gertrude |last2=Toklas |first2=Alice B. |title=Dear Sammy: Letters from Gertrude Stein & Alice B. Toklas |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton Mifflin]] |year=1977 |isbn=0-395-25340-3 |page=32}}</ref>

In Penelope Niven's biography [https://www.thorntonwilder.com/thornton-wilder-a-life ''Thornton Wilder: A Life''], she provides considerable epistolary evidence that the third act of ''Our Town'' was not written in response to any walk, conversation or affair with Samuel Steward but was begun before Wilder met Steward and was not finished until several months afterward. Niven also raises doubts about Steward's uncorroborated and unsubstantiated claims of having been Wilder's lover.<ref>{{cite book |last=Niven |first=Penelope |title=Thornton Wilder: A Life |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-06083-136-3 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/thorntonwilderli0000nive/page/433 433–437] |url=https://archive.org/details/thorntonwilderli0000nive/page/433 }}</ref>

Wilder had a wide circle of friends, including writers [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], [[Zelda Fitzgerald]], [[Alice B. Toklas]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], and [[Gertrude Stein]]; actress [[Ruth Gordon]]; fighter [[Gene Tunney]]; and socialite [[Sibyl, Lady Colefax]].<ref name=NYT/>

==Death==
From the earnings of ''The Bridge of San Luis Rey'', in 1930 Wilder built a house for his family in Hamden, Connecticut. His sister Isabel lived there for the rest of her life. This became his home base, although he traveled extensively and lived away for significant periods. He died in this house on December 7, 1975, of heart failure.<ref name=marg/> He was interred at Mount Carmel Cemetery, Hamden, Connecticut.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wilson |first=Scott |title=Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons |edition=3rd |publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc}} (Kindle Location 50886).</ref>
