'''William Rose Benét''' (February 2, 1886 – May 4, 1950) was an American poet, writer, and editor. He was the older brother of [[Stephen Vincent Benét]].

==Early life and education==
He was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]], the son of Col. James Walker Benét and his wife, Frances Neill (née Rose), and grandson of Brigadier General [[Stephen Vincent Benet (Army General)|Stephen Vincent Benét]]. He was educated [[The Albany Academy]] in [[Albany, NY]] and at [[Sheffield Scientific School]] of [[Yale University]], graduating with a [[Ph.B.]] in 1907. At Yale, he edited<ref>"William Rose Benét". ''Obituary Record of Graduates of the Undergraduate Schools Deceased during the Year 1949-1950''. New Haven: Yale University. January 1, 1951. p. 170.</ref> and contributed light verse to campus humor magazine ''[[The Yale Record]]''.<ref>Bronson, Francis W., Thomas Caldecott Chubb, and Cyril Hume, eds. (1922) ''The Yale Record Book of Verse: 1872-1922''. New Haven: Yale University Press. pp. 104-106.</ref> He began the ''[[Saturday Review (US magazine)|Saturday Review of Literature]]'' in 1924 and continued to edit and write for it until his death.

==Career==
In 1942, he was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]] for his book of autobiographical verse, ''The Dust Which Is God'' (1941). His brother [[Stephen Vincent Benét]] was awarded the same prize two years later in 1944.

Benét is also the author of ''[[The Reader's Encyclopedia]]'', a standard American guide to world literature.

Today he is perhaps best known as the author of "The Skater of Ghost Lake," a poem frequently assigned in American schools for its use of [[onomatopoeia]] and rhythm as well as its tone of dark mystery.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Personal life==
Benét married four times. First, on September 3, 1912, he married Teresa Frances Thompson, with whom he had three children ([[James Walker Benét]] (1914-2012), Frances Rosemary Benét, and Kathleen Anne Benét). Teresa died in 1919.
Benét's second wife, whom he married on October 5, 1923, was poet [[Elinor Wylie]]. She died in 1928.
Benét's third wife, whom he married on March 15, 1932, was Lora Baxter. They divorced in 1937. 
Benét's fourth wife, and widow, was children's writer [[Marjorie Flack]]. They were married from June 22, 1941, until his death in 1950.

Benét's son, [[James Walker Benét]], fought in the [[Abraham Lincoln Brigade]] and was the author of two suspense novels and a guidebook to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/nation/article/Author-activist-James-Ben-t-dies-at-98-4141164.php James Benet obituary, ''San Francisco Chronicle'' (December 22, 2012)]</ref>
