'''Amy Lawrence Lowell''' (February 9, 1874 &ndash; May 12, 1925) was an American poet of the [[imagist]] school, which promoted a return to classical values. She posthumously won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]] in 1926.

==Life==
[[File:Houghton MS Lowell 62 (2) - Notman.jpg|thumb|Lowell as a child]] 
Amy Lowell was born on February 9, 1874, in [[Boston]], Massachusetts, the daughter of [[Augustus Lowell]] and Katherine Bigelow Lowell. A member of the [[Boston Brahmin|Brahmin]] [[Lowell family]], her siblings included the astronomer [[Percival Lowell]], the educator and legal scholar [[Abbott Lawrence Lowell]], and [[Elizabeth Lowell Putnam]], an early activist for prenatal care. They were the great-grandchildren of [[John Lowell]] and, on their mother's side, the grandchildren of [[Abbott Lawrence]].<ref>[[Delmar R. Lowell|Lowell, Delmar R.]], ''The Historic Genealogy of the Lowells of America from 1639 to 1899'' (Rutland VT: The Tuttle Company, 1899), 283</ref><ref name=WDL1>{{cite web|title=Chosön, the Land of the Morning Calm; a Sketch of Korea|year=1888|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2377|publisher=World Digital Library|access-date=30 April 2013}}</ref>

School was a source of considerable despair for the young Amy Lowell. She considered herself to be developing "masculine" and "ugly" features and she was a social outcast. She had a reputation among her classmates for being outspoken and opinionated.<ref>Horace Gregory, ''Amy Lowell: Portrait of the Poet in her Own Time'', Books for Libraries Press, Freeport, New York, 1958</ref>

Lowell never attended college because her family did not consider it proper for a woman to do so.  She compensated for this lack with avid reading and near-obsessive [[book collecting]]. She lived as a socialite and travelled widely, turning to poetry in 1902 (aged 28) after being inspired by a performance of [[Eleonora Duse]] in Europe. After beginning a career as a poet when she was well into her 30s, Lowell became an enthusiastic student and disciple of the art.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Foundation|first=Poetry|date=2021-03-10|title=Amy Lowell|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/amy-lowell|access-date=2021-03-10|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en}}</ref>

Lowell was said to be [[lesbian]], and in 1912 she and actress [[Ada Dwyer Russell]] were reputed to be lovers. Russell is reputed to be the subject of Lowell's more erotic works, most notably the love poems contained in 'Two Speak Together', a subsection of ''Pictures of the Floating World''. The two women traveled to England together, where Lowell met [[Ezra Pound]], who at once became a major influence and a major critic of her work.  Pound considered Lowell's embrace of Imagism to be a kind of hijacking of the movement. Lowell has been linked romantically to writer [[Mercedes de Acosta]], but the only evidence of any contact between them is a brief correspondence about a planned memorial for Duse.

Lowell was a short but imposing figure who kept her hair in a bun and wore a [[pince-nez]].

[[File:TIME Magazine cover from March 2, 1925 featuring Amy Lowell.jpg|thumb|left|[[Time (magazine)|Time]] cover from March 2, 1925, featuring Lowell]]

Lowell publicly smoked cigars, as newspapers of the day frequently mentioned.<ref>Gregory, p. 96</ref> A glandular problem kept her perpetually overweight. Poet [[Witter Bynner]] once said, in a comment frequently misattributed to [[Ezra Pound]], that she was a "hippopoetess".<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u5AXdTOuGy4C&q=%22hippopoetess.%22+Witter+Bynner&pg=PA171| page=171| title=Amy Lowell, American modern |author1=Adrienne Munich |author2=Melissa Bradshaw | publisher=Rutgers University Press| year=2004| isbn=978-0-8135-3356-8 }}</ref> Her admirers defended her, however, even after her death. One rebuttal was written by [[Heywood Broun]] in his obituary tribute to Amy. He wrote, "She was upon the surface of things a Lowell, a New Englander and a spinster. But inside everything was molten like the core of the earth ... Given one more gram of emotion, Amy Lowell would have burst into flame and been consumed to cinders."<ref>{{cite web|title=Amy Lowell 1874–1925|url=http://www.sappho.com/poetry/a_lowell.html|website=Isle of Lesbos|publisher=Alix North}}</ref>

[[File:Grave of Amy Lowell.jpg|thumb|Grave of Amy Lowell in [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts]]

Lowell died of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] in 1925, at the age of 51 and is buried at [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]].<ref>Wilson, Scott. ''Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons'', 3d ed.: 2 (Kindle Location 28784). McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers. Kindle Edition</ref> The following year, she was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]] for ''What's O'Clock''.  That collection included the patriotic poem "Lilacs", which [[Louis Untermeyer]] said was the poem of hers he liked best.

Her first published work appeared in 1910 in ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]''. The first published collection of her poetry, ''A Dome of Many-Coloured Glass'', appeared two years later, in 1912. An additional group of uncollected poems was added to the volume ''The Complete Poetical Works of Amy Lowell'', published in 1955 with an introduction by Untermeyer, who considered himself her friend.

Though she sometimes wrote [[sonnet]]s, Lowell was an early adherent to the "[[free verse]]" method of poetry and one of the major champions of this method. She defined it in her preface to "Sword Blades and Poppy Seed" in the ''North American Review'' for January, 1917; in the closing chapter of "Tendencies in Modern American Poetry"; and also in ''The Dial'' (January 17, 1918), as:  "The definition of [[vers libre]] is: a verse-formal based upon cadence.  To understand vers libre, one must abandon all desire to find in it the even rhythm of metrical feet. One must allow the lines to flow as they will when read aloud by an intelligent reader. Or, to put it another way, unrhymed [[Cadence (poetry)|cadence]] is "built upon 'organic rhythm,' or the rhythm of the speaking voice with its necessity for breathing, rather than upon a strict metrical system.  Free verse within its own law of [[Cadence (poetry)|cadence]] has no absolute rules; it would not be 'free' if it had."<ref>Lowes, Livingston, John, ''Conventions and Revolt in Poetry'', 1919</ref>

Untermeyer writes that "She was not only a disturber but an awakener."<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N0AtxcoLkC8C&q=Untermeyer+She+was+not+only+a+disturber+but+an+awakener&pg=PA77| page=77| title=Modern American poetry, 1865–1950 |author1=Alan Shucard |author2=Fred Moramarco |author3=William Sullivan | publisher=University of Massachusetts Press| year=1990| isbn=978-0-87023-720-1 }}</ref> In many poems, Lowell dispenses with line breaks, so that the work looks like prose on the page. This technique she labeled "polyphonic prose".<ref>{{cite book| url=https://archive.org/details/americanprosepoe00delv| url-access=registration| quote=lowell polyphonic prose.| title=The American prose poem | author=Michel Delville| page=[https://archive.org/details/americanprosepoe00delv/page/6 6]| publisher=University Press of Florida| year=1998| isbn=978-0-8130-1591-0 }}</ref>

Throughout her working life, Lowell was a promoter of both contemporary and historical poets. Her book ''Fir-Flower Poets'' was a poetical re-working of literal translations of the works of ancient Chinese poets, notably [[Li Tai-po]] (701–762).  Her writing also included critical works on French literature.  At the time of her death, she was attempting to complete her two-volume biography of [[John Keats]] (work on which had long been frustrated by the noncooperation of [[F. Holland Day]], whose private collection of Keatsiana included [[Fanny Brawne]]'s letters to Frances Keats). Lowell wrote of Keats: "the stigma of oddness is the price a myopic world always exacts of genius."<ref>{{cite book| url=https://archive.org/stream/johnkeatsvolumei009666mbp/johnkeatsvolumei009666mbp_djvu.txt| title=John Keats| author=Amy Lowell| volume=II| publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company | year=1925 | page=152}}</ref>

Lowell published not only her own work, but also that of other writers. According to Untermeyer, she "captured" the Imagist movement from [[Ezra Pound]].  Pound threatened to sue her for bringing out her three-volume series ''Some Imagist Poets'', and thereafter derisively called the American Imagists the "Amygist" movement. Pound criticized her as not an imagist, but merely a rich woman who was able to financially assist the publication of imagist poetry. She said that Imagism was weak before she took it up, whereas others said it became weak after Pound's "exile" towards [[Vorticism]].

Lowell wrote at least two poems about libraries—The "Boston Athenaeum"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lowell|first1=Amy|title=A Dome of Many-Coloured Glass|date=1912|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|location=Boston|page=115|url=https://archive.org/stream/adomemanycolour00lowegoog#page/n130/mode/2up/search/boston}}</ref> and "The Congressional Library"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lowell|first1=Amy|title=The Congressional Library|url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/0101/poem_praise.html}}</ref>—during her career. A discussion of libraries also appears in her essay "Poetry, Imagination, and Education".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lowell|first1=Amy|title=Poetry, Education, and Imagination|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/g_l/amylowell/critical.htm|website=Critical Essays by Amy Lowell|publisher=Modern American Poetry, University of Illinois|access-date=1 December 2016}}</ref>

==Legacy==
In the post-[[World War I]] years, Lowell was largely forgotten, but the [[women's movement]] in the 1970s and [[women's studies]] brought her back to light. According to [[Heywood Broun]], however, Lowell personally argued against [[feminism]].<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DKNJtTw8V5sC&q=Heywood+Broun++Lowell+feminism.&pg=PA43| title=Artistic outlaws | author=Sonja Samberger| pages=43–44| publisher=LIT Verlag | place=Berlin-Hamburg-Münster| year=2005| isbn=978-3-8258-8616-5 }}</ref>

Additional sources of interest in Lowell today come from the [[anti-war]] sentiment of the oft-taught poem "Patterns"; her [[personification]] of inanimate objects, as in "The Green Bowl", and "The Red Lacquer Music Stand"; and her lesbian themes, including the love poems addressed to Ada Dwyer Russell in "Two Speak Together" and her poem "The Sisters", which addresses her female poetic predecessors.

Lowell's correspondence with her friend [[Florence Ayscough]], a writer and translator of Chinese literature, was compiled and published by Ayscough's husband Professor Harley Farnsworth MacNair in 1945.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hillbrook|first=R|date=1946|title=Florence ayscough and amy lowell|journal=Current History (Pre-1986)|volume=10|pages=445}}</ref>
