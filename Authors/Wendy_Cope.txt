'''Wendy Cope''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OBE}} (born 21 July 1945) is a contemporary English poet.  She read history at [[St Hilda's College, Oxford]].  She now lives in [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]], [[Cambridgeshire]], with her husband, the poet [[Lachlan Mackinnon]].

==Biography==
Cope was born in [[Erith]] in [[Kent]] (now in the [[London Borough of Bexley]]), where her father Fred Cope was manager of the local department store, Hedley Mitchell. She was educated at West Lodge Preparatory School in [[Sidcup]] and Farrington's School, [[Chislehurst]], both in Kent.<ref name="statesman"/> Following her graduation from [[St Hilda's College, Oxford]] Cope spent fifteen years as a primary-school teacher.  In 1981, she became Arts and Reviews editor for the [[Inner London Education Authority]] magazine, ''Contact''. Five years later she became a freelance writer and was a television critic for ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine until 1990.

Five collections of her adult poetry have been published, ''Making Cocoa for Kingsley Amis'' in 1986, ''Serious Concerns'' in 1992, ''If I Don't Know'' in 2001,  ''Family Values'' in 2011, and ''Anecdotal Evidence'' in 2018. She has also edited several anthologies of comic verse and was a judge of the 2007 [[Man Booker Prize]].

In 1998, she was voted the listeners' choice in a [[BBC Radio 4]] poll to succeed [[Ted Hughes]] as [[Poet Laureate]].<ref Name="G2008">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jun/02/hayfestival2008.guardianhayfestival.|title=''The Guardian'' "Wendy Cope: I don't want to be laureate" 2 June 2008|access-date=27 January 2019}}</ref> When [[Andrew Motion]]'s term as Poet Laureate came to an end in 2009, Cope was again widely considered a popular candidate,<ref Name="G2008"/> although she believes the post should be discontinued.<ref Name="G2008"/><ref>{{YouTube|tzlsHG1weEo|University Challenge – Jesus, Oxford vs Warwick. Part 2 of 3.}}</ref> [[Carol Ann Duffy]] succeeded Motion as Poet Laureate.

Cope was appointed [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the 2010 Birthday Honours.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=59446 |date=12 June 2010 |page=9 |supp=y}}</ref> In April 2011, the [[British Library]] purchased Cope's archive including  manuscripts, school reports and 40,000 emails, the largest email archive they have bought to date. The papers also includes 67 poetry notebooks and unpublished poems. Cope commented "I wanted to find a good home for my archive. The timing was dictated because we had to move home, so we needed some money to buy a house, and the space. So this was the moment. I asked [[Andrew Motion]] what I should do, and he told me someone to approach at the British Library. I wasn't sure they would want it, but they did." When the collection is catalogued and organised, the archive will be available to researchers.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/apr/20/wendy-cope-archive-british-library ''The Guardian'' "Wendy Cope's archive sold to British Library"] 20 April 2011</ref>

In 2013, after 19 years of living together, Cope married Lachlan Mackinnon in a register office, although she has stated that she would have preferred a [[civil partnership]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/feb/14/wendy-cope-marriage-civil-partnership-wedding|title=Wendy Cope: 'We like being married but we should have had a choice'|website=The Guardian|date=14 February 2014|access-date=16 February 2017}}</ref>

In January 2019 she was the guest on BBC Radio 4's long-running programme ''[[Desert Island Discs]]''. Her book choice was ''[[Nigel Molesworth|The Compleet Molesworth]]'', her luxury item was writing materials and her favourite track was [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach's]] [[Concerto for Two Violins (Bach)|Concerto for Two Violins and Strings in D minor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m00026h6|title=BBC Radio 4 - Desert Island Discs, Wendy Cope, poet|website=BBC|access-date=27 January 2019}}</ref>

==Critical reception==
Despite her slight output, her books have sold well and she has attracted a popular following with her lighthearted, often comical poetry, as well as achieving literary credibility winning two awards and making an award shortlist over a fourteen-year period.<ref Name="PA"/> She has a keen eye for the everyday, mundane aspects of English life, especially the desires, frustrations, hopes, confusions and emotions in intimate relationships.<ref Name="PA">{{cite web|url=https://www.poetryarchive.org/poet/wendy-cope|title=Wendy Cope - poetryarchive.org|website=www.poetryarchive.org|access-date=27 January 2019}}</ref> Dr [[Rowan Williams]] is a well known fan of her work, writing that: "Wendy Cope is without doubt the wittiest of contemporary English poets, and says a lot of extremely serious things".<ref>''[http://www.poetryarchive.org/poetryarchive/singleTour.do?tourId=7758 "poetryarchive.org"]'' A Tour of the Archive with Dr Rowan Williams</ref>

Three [[haiku]] from ''Making Cocoa for Kingsley Amis'', where they are presented as being written by the (fictional) [[Tulse Hill]] poet Jason Strugnell, were set by the composer [[Colin Matthews]] in 1990 as ''[[Strugnell's Haiku]]''.<ref>Matthews, Colin (1990). ''Strugnell's Haiku''. London: Faber Music. {{ISBN|9780571511730}}</ref>

In 2008 Cope's poem "After The Lunch" was used as the lyric  of the song "Waterloo Bridge" by jazz composer and musician [[Jools Holland]] and singer Louise Marshall.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Carey |first1=Russell |last2=Fairhill |first2=Anne |last3=Rank |first3=Tom |title=A/AS Level English Literature A for AQA Student Book |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |date=12 November 2015 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vVKDCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA98 |isbn= 978-110-7467-92-7 |page=98}}</ref>

==Style==
Some of her poems are written in the persona of a struggling male poet, Jason Strugnell, a slightly seedy figure from [[Tulse Hill]].  She displays her talent for [[parody]]<ref Name="PA"/> with targets ranging from the sonnets of [[Philip Sidney|Sir Philip Sidney]]:

<blockquote>
My true love hath my heart and I have hers<br/>
We swapped last Tuesday and felt quite elated<br/>
But now whenever one of us refers<br/>
To 'my heart' things get rather complicated.<br/>
</blockquote>

to reducing [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Waste Land]]'' to [[limerick (poetry)|limerick]]s:

<blockquote>
In April one seldom feels cheerful;<br/>
Dry stones, sun and dust make me fearful;<br/>
Clairvoyants distress me,<br/>
Commuters depress me—<br/>
Met Stetson and gave him an earful.<br/>
</blockquote>

Her style has been compared to that of [[John Betjeman]] and [[Philip Larkin]].
