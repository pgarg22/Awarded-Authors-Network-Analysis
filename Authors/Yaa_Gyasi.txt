In March 2021, she wrote an essay on "this question of 'the business of reading', of how we read, why we read, and what reading ''does'' for and to us." She wrote, "While I do devoutly believe in the power of literature to challenge, to deepen, to change, I also know that buying books by black authors is but a theoretical, grievously belated and utterly impoverished response to centuries of physical and emotional harm."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Gyasi|first=Yaa|date=2021-03-20|title=White people, black authors are not your medicine|url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/mar/20/white-people-black-authors-are-not-your-medicine|url-status=live|access-date=2021-03-21|website=the Guardian|language=en}}</ref>
