===Style and themes===
Tim Sanford, artistic director of [[Playwrights Horizons]] noted that she is willing "to take on 'ideas and history, which not everyone believes in anymore.' He also praises the sophistication of her structures and characters. 'You can see the affinity for Richard Nelson, who was her teacher,' Sanford points out, referring to the veteran playwright and teacher at Yale School of Drama."<ref name=alexis/>

Richard Nelson said: "She has great, great facility for dialogue&nbsp;... It's clean, it's simple, it's evocative, it's witty. It's alive and easily spoken. Very, very actable. That's a given talent." John Guare noted "Amy came fully formed" Guare also mentioned her "warm-hearted, cold-eyed sympathy for her characters."<ref name=alexis/>

Herzog based several characters in her plays on family members. The character of Vera Joseph in ''4000 Miles'' is based on Herzog's grandmother, Leepee. Vera initially appeared in her play ''After the Revolution''.  Leo in ''4000 Miles'' is based on her cousin who lost a good friend. The "Josephs" in her plays are also partially based on her father's stepfamily.<ref>Snyder, Diane.

[[Charles Isherwood]], reviewing in ''The New York Times'', wrote: Herzog "has emerged in the past few years as one of the bright theatrical lights of her generation.&nbsp;... She writes with a keen sensitivity to the complex weave of feelings embedded in all human relationships, with particular attention to the way we tiptoe around areas of radioactive emotion.
