'''Jill Marie Landis''' (born November 8, 1948, in [[Clinton, Indiana]], United States) is an  American [[author]] of historical and contemporary [[romance novels]].

==Biography==
Jill Marie Landis was born on November 8, 1948, in Indiana, but moved to California when she was only ten years old. While studying for her [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in history from [[Long Beach State University]], Landis held summer jobs working as a ride operator for [[Fantasyland]] at [[Disneyland]].

Upon graduation, she spent ten years as a kindergarten teacher and then three years teaching English as a Second Language part-time. Although Landis wrote her first romance novel in junior high, she did not decide to pursue a writing career until 1983. Three years after she committed to writing a full-length novel, Landis sold a manuscript. From 1988 through 2003, she published sixteen historical romance novels. In July 2003, she made her debut in the contemporary romance genre. In 2008, her first inspirational historical romance, Homecoming, was published by Steeple Hill. It was followed in 2009 by The Accidental Lawman. Writing for Zondervan, Landis published Heart of Stone, the first book of the Irish Angels Series in 2010.

Landis and her husband of over forty years, Steve, an actor and slack key guitar player, claim to share their eighty-year-old home in [[Long Beach, California]], with the ghost of writer [[Upton Sinclair]].[https://web.archive.org/web/20060326064130/http://www.jillmarielandis.com/notefromjill.htm] The childless couple (by choice) also have a home in [[Hawaii]] where they now live full-time.

Landis has successfully completed the 6.5 hour [[kayak]]ing trip around [[Kauai]]'s [[Nā Pali Coast State Park|Na Pali]] coastline, and she also enjoys raising [[orchids]], playing the [[ukulele]], [[quilting]] and dancing [[hula]].

Over the last few years her back list of award-winning, bestselling historical romances has been re-issued in eBook formats. By the end of 2014 most of her works will be available as eBook downloads.
