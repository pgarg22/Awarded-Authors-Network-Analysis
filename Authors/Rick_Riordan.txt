==Rick Riordan Presents==
{{main|Rick Riordan Presents}}
In September 2016, [[Disney Publishing Worldwide|Disney]]-[[Hachette Books#Hyperion Books|Hyperion]] announced a new Rick Riordan [[Imprint (trade name)|imprint]]. The imprint is called "[[Rick Riordan Presents]]" and was launched in March 2018. It is headed by Riordan's editor, Stephanie Owens Lurie.<ref name="imprint1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-industry-news/article/71466-disney-announces-new-rick-riordan-imprint.html|title=Disney Announces New Rick Riordan Imprint|last=Corbett|first=Sue|date=September 13, 2016|website=Publishers Weekly Online|publisher=[[Publishers Weekly]]|access-date=May 28, 2017}}</ref>

Lurie said that Riordan had been approached about an imprint several years ago but initially dismissed the idea because of his heavy workload. Later, he reported back that he had been "toying with the idea" and was "willing to go forward with a publishing line that was not a brand extension for his own work but a platform for Riordan to bring other great writers to the attention of his vast and loyal audience."<ref name="imprint1"/> She also said that the imprint planned to launch with two then undetermined books. "The point of making this announcement now is to get the word out about what we’re looking for.”<ref name="imprint1"/>

The imprint will not publish books written by Riordan, "whose role will be closer to curator".<ref name="imprint1"/> In an interview with the ''Iowa Gazette'', Riordan said, "Instead of me writing all of the mythologies we are going to look for authors who already are writing about that stuff. If I feel like I can recommend them [to my readers] ... we’re going to have them out here in the spotlight."<ref name="imprint2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thegazette.com/rick-riordan-brings-stories-to-iowa-city-20161031|title=Rick Riordan brings stories to Iowa City|last=Kuennen|first=Alyson|date=October 31, 2016|website=TheGazette.com|publisher=The Iowa Gazette|access-date=May 28, 2017}}</ref> A focus will be placed on "diverse, mythology-based fiction by new, emerging, and under-represented authors".
