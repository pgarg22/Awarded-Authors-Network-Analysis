'''Edward Brewster (Ned) Sheldon''' ([[Chicago, Illinois]], February 4, 1886 – April 1, 1946, [[New York City]]) was an American dramatist. His plays include ''Salvation Nell'' (1908) and ''[[Romance (Sheldon play)|Romance]]'' (1913), which was made into a motion picture with [[Greta Garbo]].

After becoming ill at age 29 with crippling [[rheumatoid arthritis]], which eventually claimed his sight (around 1930), Sheldon became a source of emotional and creative support for his many friends, notably [[Mrs. Fiske|Minnie Maddern Fiske]] (he wrote ''Salvation Nell'' for her), [[Julia Marlowe]], [[John Barrymore]] (his closest friend and confidante), [[Thornton Wilder]], [[Alexander Woollcott]], [[Anne Morrow Lindbergh]], [[Ruth Gordon]], [[Helen Hayes]]. While in hospital his advice was received by those in the theatrical profession as gospel. Actress and librettist [[Dorothy Donnelly]] formed a close friendship with Sheldon, and after he became bedridden often assisted with transcribing, editing, and supporting his work.

In May 1915 Sheldon narrowly missed sailing on the ''[[RMS Lusitania|Lusitania]]'''s infamous last voyage. He had been asked by theater impresario [[Charles Frohman]] to accompany him to England. A Harvard classmate of Sheldon's was getting married on May 11 and asked Sheldon to be best man. Sheldon then declined Frohman's offer.

A 1936 lawsuit against [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] for copyright infringement claimed that the script MGM used for the [[1932 in film|1932]] motion picture ''[[Letty Lynton]]'' plagiarized material from the play ''Dishonored Lady'' by Sheldon and [[Margaret Ayer Barnes]]. The film is still unavailable today because of this lawsuit.

His life is detailed in ''The Man Who Lived Twice'' by [[Eric Wollencott Barnes]]. In this biography Barnes states that Sheldon was in love all his adult life with [[Doris Keane]], the actress who starred in ''Romance'' in 1913.
