'''David Garnett''' (9 March 1892 – 17 February 1981) was a British writer and publisher. As a child, he had a cloak made of rabbit skin and thus received the nickname "Bunny", by which he was known to friends and intimates all his life.

==Early life==

Garnett was born in [[Brighton]], [[East Sussex]], the only child of writer, critic and publisher [[Edward Garnett]] and his wife [[Constance Garnett|Constance Clara Black]], a translator of Russian. His paternal [[Richard Garnett (writer)|grandfather]] and [[Richard Garnett (philologist)|great-grandfather]] both worked at what is now the [[British Library]], then within the [[British Museum]].{{sfn|EB|2021}}

As a [[conscientious objector]] in the [[First World War]], Garnett worked on fruit farms in [[Suffolk]] and [[Sussex]] with his lover [[Duncan Grant]].

==Work==

A prominent member of the [[Bloomsbury Group]], Garnett received literary recognition when his novel ''[[Lady into Fox]]'', an [[allegorical]] [[fantasy]],<ref>[[John Clute]] ''Lady into Fox'', in [[Frank N. Magill]] (ed.), ''Survey of Modern Fantasy Literature'', Vol 2. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Salem Press, Inc., 1983, pp. 863–866.</ref> was awarded the 1922 [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for fiction. He ran a bookshop near the [[British Museum]] with [[Francis Birrell]] during the 1920s. He also founded (with [[Francis Meynell]]) the [[Nonesuch Press]].  He wrote the novel ''[[Aspects of Love (novel)|Aspects of Love]]'' (1955), on which the later [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] [[Aspects of Love|musical of the same name]] would be based.{{sfn|EB|2021}}

Garnett published a memoir, ''The Golden Echo'' in 1953.{{sfn|Garnett|1953}} Subsequently he wrote two further volumes under the title ''The Golden Echo'' with subtitles ''The Flowers of the Forest'' (1955),{{sfn|Garnett|1955}} and ''The Familiar Faces'' (1962).{{sfn|Garnett|1962}} In this memoir, Garnett described the English literary circles he moved among, including the Bloomsbury group.{{sfn|EB|2021}}

==Personal life==

His first wife was the illustrator Rachel "Ray" Marshall (1891–1940), sister of the translator and diarist [[Frances Partridge]]. He and Ray, whose woodcuts appear in some of Garnett's books, had two sons, the older of which was Richard Garnett (1923–2013), the writer.<ref>Nicholas Barker, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/richard-garnett-typographer-editor-and-writer-who-grew-up-amid-the-bloomsbury-group-8644425.html "Richard Garnett: Typographer, editor and writer who grew up amid the Bloomsbury group"] (obituary), ''[[The Independent]]'', 5 June 2013.</ref> Ray died relatively young of breast cancer.

Garnett was [[bisexual]], as were several members of the artistic and literary [[Bloomsbury Group]], and he had affairs with [[Francis Birrell]] and [[Duncan Grant]]. On 25 December 1918 he was present at the birth of Grant's daughter by [[Vanessa Bell]],  [[Angelica Garnett|Angelica]], who was accepted by Vanessa's husband [[Clive Bell]]. Shortly afterwards he wrote to a friend: "I think of marrying it. When she is 20, I shall be 46 – will it be scandalous?" On 8 May 1942, when Angelica was in her early twenties, they did marry, to the horror of her parents. She did not find out until much later that her husband had been a lover of her father.

The Garnetts lived at [[Hilton Hall, Cambridgeshire|Hilton Hall]], near [[St Ives, Cambridgeshire|St Ives]] in [[Huntingdonshire]], where David Garnett kept a herd of [[Jersey cows]].{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

They had four daughters: in order, [[Amaryllis Garnett|Amaryllis]], [[Henrietta Garnett|Henrietta]], and the twins Nerissa and Frances; eventually the couple separated. Amaryllis Virginia Garnett (1943–1973) was an actress who had a small part in [[Harold Pinter]]'s film adaptation of ''[[The Go-Between (1971 film)|The Go-Between]]'' (1970). She drowned in the Thames, aged 29. Henrietta Garnett (1945—2019) married [[Burgo Partridge|Lytton Burgo Partridge]], her father's nephew by his first wife Ray, but was left a widow with a newborn infant when she was 18;<ref>Adam Kuper, ''Incest and Influence: The Private Life of Bourgeois England'', Harvard University Press, 2009, p. 242, {{ISBN|0-674-03589-5}}.</ref> she oversaw the legacies of both David Garnett and Duncan Grant.  Nerissa Garnett (1946–2004) was an artist, ceramicist, and photographer. Fanny (Frances) Garnett moved to France where she became a farmer.

==Later life==

After his separation from Angelica, Garnett moved to France and lived in the grounds at the [[Château de Charry]], [[Montcuq]] (near [[Cahors]]), in a house leased to him by the owners, Jo and Angela d'Urville.<ref>Sarah Knights (2015), ''Bloomsbury's Outsider: A Life of David Garnett'', Bloomsbury Reader (632 pp.), p. 509. {{ISBN|978-1-4482-1545-4}}.</ref> Garnett continued to write and lived there until his death in 1981.<ref name="PalmerPalmer1987">{{cite book|author1=Alan Palmer|author2=Alan Warwick Palmer|author3=Veronica Palmer|title=Who's who in Bloomsbury|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W21nAAAAMAAJ|year=1987|publisher=Harvester Press|isbn=978-0-7108-0312-2|page=67}}</ref>
