'''Aganice Ainianos''' ({{lang-el|Αγανίκη Αινιάνος Μαζαράκη}}; 1838–1892) was a Greek poet.

==Biography==
Ainianos was born in [[Athens]] in 1838. Her father was the Greek politician {{ill|George Ainian|el|Γεώργιος Αινιάν}} (1788–1848), a founder of the secret society [[Filiki Eteria]]. She was orphaned at an early age and was raised by her uncle, {{ill|Dimitrios Ainian|el|Δημήτριος Αινιάν}}, who was involved in the uprising against King [[Otto of Greece]]. They were forced to flee to the mountains and lived in hiding.<ref name="Kairis">{{cite book|editor = Φιλεκπαιδευτική Εταιρεία|author = Πηνελόπη Μ.

She returned to live with her relatives in Athens, studying mathematics at the [[Arsakeio]] and graduating at the age of 17. She then studied ancient Greek writers, French poets and prose writers. She married Ioannis Mazarakis in [[Kythnos]] in 1860.<ref name="Kairis"/> Her children were [[Konstantinos Mazarakis-Ainian]] (b. 1869), [[Alexandros Mazarakis-Ainian]] (b. 1874), and Philippos Mazarakis-Ainian.

Ainianos composed poetry for herself. Her experience living in the countryside provided context for her poetry, especially her poems about impoverished working women, nature, and beauty. She wrote in the Greek vernacular rather than [[Katharevousa]] and her style revealed a sense of realism, free of the age's pseudo-romanticism.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Uglow|editor1-first=Jennifer S.|title=The International Dictionary of Women's Biography|date=1985|publisher=Continuum|location=New York|isbn=0-8264-0192-9|pages=8–9}}</ref>
