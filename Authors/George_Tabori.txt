'''George Tabori''' (24 May 1914 – 23 July 2007) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] writer and [[theater director]].

==Life and career==
Tabori was born in [[Budapest]] as György Tábori, a son of Kornél and Elsa Tábori. His father Kornél (Cornelius) died in [[Auschwitz]] in 1944, but his mother and his brother [[Paul Tabori]] (writer and psychical researcher), managed to escape the Nazis.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Embodied Memory: The Theatre of George Tabori|last=Feinberg|first=Anat|publisher=University of Iowa Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0-87745-686-5|location=Iowa City|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780877456865/page/4 4]|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780877456865/page/4}}</ref> As a young man, Tabori travelled to [[Berlin]] but was forced to leave [[Nazi Germany]] in 1935 because of his [[Jew]]ish background. He first went to London, where he worked for the [[BBC]] and received British citizenship. In 1947 he emigrated to the United States, where he became a translator (mainly of works by [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Max Frisch]]) and a screenwriter<ref name="ABC">[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/07/25/1988028.htm?section=entertainment Reuters via ABC News Australia, "Playwright George Tabori dies" 25 July 2007]</ref> including Alfred Hitchcock's movie ''[[I Confess (film)|I Confess]]'' (1953).

His first novel, ''Beneath The Stone'', was published in America in 1945. In the late 1960s, Tabori brought his own and the work of Brecht to many colleges and universities. At the [[University of Pennsylvania]] he taught classes in dramatic writing which resulted in Werner Liepolt's ''The Young Master Dante'' and [[Ron Cowen]]'s ''Summertree''. Two of Tabori's plays in English -- ''The Cannibals'' and ''Pinkville''—were produced by [[Wynn Handman]] at the [[American Place Theatre]] in New York City from 1968 through 1970. His play ''The Prince'' was filmed by [[John Boorman]] as ''[[Leo the Last]]'' (1970) with [[Marcello Mastroianni]] and [[Billie Whitelaw]]; the film won the Director's Prize at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in that year.

During his period in America, Tabori married [[Viveca Lindfors]].  In addition to his own child with Lindfors, Lena, Tabori adopted Lindfors' two sons, John and [[Kristoffer Tabori|Kristoffer]]. Kristoffer later became an actor and Lena a publisher.

In 1971, Tabori moved to Germany, where his new emphasis was theater work, and mainly worked in Berlin, Munich, and Vienna. His 1991 ''[[Goldberg Variations (play)|Goldberg Variations]]'' is a satirical farce based on Biblical stories which end in disaster.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kiepenheuer-medien.de/Werke/data_werke/973/showWerk|title=George Tabori: Die Goldberg-Variationen|publisher=Kiepenheuer Bühnenvertrieb|date=22 June 1991|access-date=18 November 2018 |language=de}}</ref>
