'''Paolo Ferrari''' (1822&ndash;1889), [[Italy|Italian]] dramatist, was born at [[Modena]]. His numerous works, chiefly comedies, and all marked by a fresh and piquant style, are the finest product of the modern Italian drama. After producing some minor pieces, in 1852 he made his reputation as a playwright with ''Goldoni e le sue Sedici Commedie''. Among numerous later plays his comedy ''Parini e la Satira'' (1857) had considerable success. Ferrari may be regarded as a follower of [[Carlo Goldoni]], modelling himself on the French theatrical methods. in 1860 he was appointed professor of History at Modena and afterwards at Milan. His collected plays were published in 1877&ndash;1880 in 14 volumes.
