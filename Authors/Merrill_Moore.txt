After the war, Moore played a key behind-the-scenes role in the [[Ezra Pound]] controversy, as a member of a group of literary men who saw to it that the modernist icon escaped a treason trial for his radio propaganda in support of Mussolini. Moore was a close friend of one of the psychiatrists on a diagnostic panel that found Pound unfit to stand trial.<ref name="politicalchristenson">{{cite book|last1=Christenson|first1=Ron|title=Political Trials: Gordian Knots in the Law|date=1999|publisher=Transaction Publishers|location=New Brunswick, New Jersey|isbn=9780765804730|oclc=39307364|page=[https://archive.org/details/politicaltrialsg00chri/page/93 93]|url=https://archive.org/details/politicaltrialsg00chri|url-access=registration|quote=ezra pound merrill moore overholser.}}</ref>

==Poetry==
Throughout his career Moore produced [[sonnet]]s in a very high volume. Estimates vary but by 1935, [[Louis Untermeyer]] had counted 25,000 sonnets in Moore's files, according to a Time Magazine article that year;<ref name="doctorsoutput35">{{cite news|title=Books: Doctor's Output|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,748448,00.html?iid=digg_share|accessdate=August 17, 2016|work=Time Magazine|date=February 11, 1935}}</ref> just over two years later, a 1938 Talk of the Town piece in the New Yorker put Moore's total production of sonnets at 50,000.<ref name="newyorkerannoyinglyfertile">{{cite news|last1=Cooke|first1=Charles|last2=Maloney|first2=Russell|title=Annoyingly Fertile.|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1938/12/24/annoyingly-fertile|accessdate=August 17, 2016|work=The New Yorker|date=December 24, 1938}}</ref>

Moore discovered his affinity for the sonnet form while still in secondary school and is said to have learned shorthand during college in order to be able to write more sonnets between classes. Although some of his work, such as the posthumous quatrain collection ''The Phoenix and the Bees'', is in other forms, the poet-psychiatrist wrote and archived his poems in a dedicated home office he called his "sonnetorium." Some of his books, like ''Case Record from a Sonnetorium'' or ''More Clinical Sonnets'', were illustrated by [[Edward Gorey]].<ref name="worldcatcase">{{cite book|title=Case record from a sonnetorium.|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/case-record-from-a-sonnetorium/oclc/2654041&referer=brief_results|website=WorldCat|oclc = 2654041|accessdate=August 17, 2016}}</ref><ref name="worldcatmoreclinical">{{cite book|title=More clinical sonnets|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/more-clinical-sonnets/oclc/2770322&referer=brief_results|website=WorldCat|oclc = 2770322|accessdate=August 17, 2016}}</ref>

It was Moore who put the young [[Robert Lowell]] in contact with literary men including [[Ford Madox Ford]], [[Allen Tate]] and [[John Crowe Ransom]], and who encouraged Lowell to become a student of Ransom after Lowell's sudden violent break with his family and departure from Harvard.<ref name="kirschharbrahmin">{{cite news|last1=Kirsch|first1=Adam|title=The Brahmin Rebel|url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2004/05/the-brahmin-rebel.html|accessdate=August 17, 2016|work=Harvard Magazine|date=May 2004}}</ref><ref name="lowellaustinlib">{{cite web|title=Robert Lowell: An Inventory of His Papers at the Harry Ransom Center|url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/uthrc/00081/hrc-00081.html|website=Texas Archival Resources Online|publisher=Harry Ransom Humanities Center: The University of Texas at Austin|accessdate=August 17, 2016}}</ref>
