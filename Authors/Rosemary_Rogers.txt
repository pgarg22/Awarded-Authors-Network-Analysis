Rogers lived among many servants and was sheltered from much of the outside world. She began writing at age eight, and throughout her teens penned many romantic epics in the style of her favorite writers, [[Sir Walter Scott]], [[Alexandre Dumas, père]], and [[Rafael Sabatini]].<ref name="darrach"/><ref name="murphy"/>  She was the first woman in her family to work outside the home as a feature writer for a Ceylon newspaper.<ref name=":0" />

After spending three years at the [[University of Ceylon]], Rogers became a reporter, and soon married [[Summa Navaratnam]], a Ceylonese [[rugby football|rugby]] player and [[track and field|track]] star (who played for [[Sri Lanka national rugby union team|Ceylon]] against the [[1950 British Lions tour to New Zealand and Australia|1950]] [[British and Irish Lions|British Lions]] and who was known as "the fastest man in Asia").<ref>{{Cite news|date=2019-11-23|first=Jayanta|last= Kurukulasuriya|title=Summa Navaratnam’s ex-spouse Rosemary Rogers dies in California|url=http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2019/11/24/sports/summa-navaratnam%E2%80%99s-ex-spouse-rosemary-rogers-dies-california|access-date=2021-05-24|work=[[Sunday Observer (Sri Lanka)|Sunday Observer]]|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=de Joodt |first1=Ken |title=Sprinter Summa - fastest man in Asia |url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2006/09/09/spo20.asp |work=[[Daily News (Sri Lanka)|Daily News]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916200359/http://www.dailynews.lk/2006/09/09/spo20.asp |archive-date=16 September 2011}}</ref> Following a separation from her husband, Rogers moved with their two daughters, Rosanne and Sharon, to [[London]] in 1960.<ref name="darrach"/><ref name="murphy"/>

In Europe, she met Leroy Rogers from the United States.   They married in his home town, [[St. Louis, Missouri]] and she moved her family to [[California]], where they had two sons, Michael and Adam. The second marriage ended after eight years, and Rogers was left to support herself and four children on her salary as a typist for the [[Solano County, California|Solano County]] Parks Department. The following year, in 1969, her parents came to live with Rogers.<ref name="darrach"/><ref name="murphy"/> In Solano County, she met [[Shirlee Busbee]], and Rosemary became her friend and mentor.<ref name="shirlee-busbee.com">{{Citation | title = Shirlee Busbee's Bio | url = http://www.shirlee-busbee.com/Bio.html | access-date = 2012-04-07 }}</ref>

Her third marriage, in September 1984, was to poet Christopher Kadison, 20 years her junior. It was a short-lived union.

Rogers later made her home in [[California]], where she continued to write until her death.

Rogers died on November 12, 2019  at her home in Monterey, California. She was 86 years old.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rosemary Rogers Obituary |url=https://legacy.com/obituaries/name/rosemary-rogers-obituary?pid=194638568 |website=[[Legacy.com]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200604094529/https://legacy.com/obituaries/name/rosemary-rogers-obituary?pid=194638568 |archive-date=4 Jun 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title="The Queen of Historical Romances" is no more |url=https://www.pressreader.com/sri-lanka/sunday-times-sri-lanka/20191201/283059826240094 |work=[[The Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)|The Sunday Times]] |date=1 December 2019|via=[[PressReader]]}}</ref>

===Writing career===
Every night for a year, Rogers worked to perfect a manuscript that she had written as a child, rewriting it 24 times. When her teenage daughter found the manuscript in a drawer, she encouraged her mother to send the manuscript to [[Avon Publishers' senior editor, Nancy Coffey, (publishers)|Avon]] which quickly purchased the novel.<ref name="darrach"/>  That novel, ''Sweet Savage Love'', skyrocketed to the top of bestseller lists, and became one of the most popular historical romances of all time.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}  Her second novel, ''Dark Fires'', sold two million copies in its first three months of release.<ref name="thurston">{{cite book|last=Thurston|first=Carol|title=The Romance Revolution|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana and Chicago|year=1987|isbn=0-252-01442-1|pages=47–48}}</ref>

Rosemary Rogers was one of the first romance authors to extend her scenes into the bedroom. Her novels are often full of violence, and the heroines are usually raped several times, sometimes by the heroes, and sometimes by other men.  Her heroines travel to exotic locations and meet important people.<ref name="darrach">{{Cite news  | last =Darrach  | first =Brad  | title = Rosemary's Babies | newspaper = Time  | date = January 17, 1977 | url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,918604-2,00.html| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20071113100627/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,918604-2,00.html| url-status =dead| archive-date =November 13, 2007|access-date=2007-05-24  }}</ref> In many cases, one or both of the protagonists follows a "riches-to-rags-to-riches" storyline.<ref name="murphy"/>
