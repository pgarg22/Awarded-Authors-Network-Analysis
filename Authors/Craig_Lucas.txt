'''Craig Lucas''' (born April 30, 1951) is an American playwright, screenwriter, theatre director, [[Musical theater|musical]] actor, and film director.

==Biography==
Born on April 30, 1951, he was found abandoned in a car in Atlanta, Georgia. Lucas was adopted when he was eight months old by a conservative Pennsylvania couple. His father was an FBI agent; his mother was a painter. She was born Jewish but suppressed the identity, which Lucas relates in his storytelling.<ref name=Gener>{{cite news|last=Gener|first=Randy|title=Rachel in Wonderland: Interview with playwright Craig Lucas on "Reckless" as a hallucinatory Christmas fable|url=http://cultureofoneworld.org/2011/11/23/rachel-in-wonderland-interview-with-playwright-craig-lucas-on-reckless-as-a-hallucinatory-christmas-fable/|access-date=August 21, 2012|newspaper=Culture of One World (originally commissioned for Applause)|date=November 23, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028220114/http://cultureofoneworld.org/2011/11/23/rachel-in-wonderland-interview-with-playwright-craig-lucas-on-reckless-as-a-hallucinatory-christmas-fable/|archive-date=October 28, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> He graduated in 1969 from [[Conestoga High School]] in Berwyn, Pennsylvania. In the 1960s and 1970s, Lucas became interested in the political left and discovered an attraction toward men. He is openly gay,<ref name=Gener/> and recalls that his coming out made it possible for him to develop as a playwright and as a person.

In 1973, Lucas left Boston University with a Bachelor of Arts in theatre and creative writing. His mentor [[Anne Sexton]] urged him to move to New York City to become a playwright. He worked in many day jobs while performing in Broadway musicals including ''[[Shenandoah (musical)|Shenandoah]]'', ''[[On the Twentieth Century]]'', ''[[Rex (musical)|Rex]]'', and ''[[Sweeney Todd (musical)|Sweeney Todd]]''.  [[Stephen Sondheim]] later told him he was a better writer than actor.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Esther|first=John|title=[[The Gay & Lesbian Review Worldwide]]|journal=Gay & Lesbian Review|year=2005|publisher=Gay & Lesbian Review, Inc.|location=[[Boston, Massachusetts]] |issn=1532-1118}}</ref>

Lucas met [[Norman René]] in 1979. Their first collaboration was ''[[Marry Me a Little (musical)|Marry Me a Little]]'' in 1981. The two wrote a script incorporating songs that had been written for but discarded from Stephen Sondheim musicals, and René also directed. They followed this with the plays ''[[Missing Persons (play)|Missing Persons]]'' (1981) and ''[[Blue Window (play)|Blue Window]]'' (1984); ''[[Three Postcards]]'' (1987), an original musical by Lucas and [[Craig Carnelia]]; and another play, ''[[Reckless (play)|Reckless]]'' (1983).<ref>Jones, Kenneth.
