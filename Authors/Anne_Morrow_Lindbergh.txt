'''Anne Spencer Morrow Lindbergh''' (June 22, 1906 – February 7, 2001) was an American author and aviator. She was the wife of decorated pioneer aviator [[Charles Lindbergh]], with whom she made many exploratory flights.

Raised in [[Englewood, New Jersey]], and later [[New York City]], Anne Morrow graduated from [[Smith College]] in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]] in 1928. She married Charles in 1929, and in 1930 became the first woman to receive a U.S. [[glider pilot]] license. Throughout the early 1930s, she served as radio operator and copilot to Charles on multiple exploratory flights and [[aerial surveys]]. Following the 1932 [[Lindbergh kidnapping|kidnapping and murder of their eldest child]], Anne and Charles moved to Europe in 1935 to escape the American press and hysteria surrounding the case, where their views shifted during the preliminary time of [[World War II]] towards an alleged sympathy for [[Nazi Germany]] and a concern for the United States’ ability to compete with Germany in the war with their opposing air power. When they returned to America in 1939, the couple supported the isolationist [[America First Committee]] before ultimately expressing public support for the U.S. war effort after the 1941 [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] and subsequent [[United States declaration of war upon Germany (1941)|United States declaration of war upon Germany]].

After the war, she moved away from politics and wrote extensive poetry and nonfiction that helped the Lindberghs regain their reputation, which had been greatly damaged since the days leading up to the war. She authored the popular ''[[Gift from the Sea]]'' (1955), that appears to foreshadow the [[Green politics|green movement]], and became an inspirational figure for many American women.  According to ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', the book was one of the top nonfiction bestsellers of the 1950s.<ref name="rank">Alice Payne Hackett. ''70 years of bestsellers: 1895-1965'' (1967), p, 162</ref> After suffering a series of [[strokes]] throughout the 1990s that left her disoriented and disabled, Anne died in 2001 at the age of 94.

At the time, Morrow was a shy 21-year-old senior at Smith College.

She would later write in her diary:
{{quote|He is taller than anyone else—you see his head in a moving crowd and you notice his glance, where it turns, as though it were keener, clearer, and brighter than anyone else's, lit with a more intense fire....

==Kidnapping of son==
{{Main|Lindbergh kidnapping}}
On March 1, 1932, the Lindberghs' first child, 20-month-old [[Lindbergh kidnapping|Charles Augustus Lindbergh Jr.]], was kidnapped from their home, [[Highfields (Amwell and Hopewell, New Jersey)|Highfields]], in [[East Amwell, New Jersey]], outside [[Hopewell, New Jersey|Hopewell]].{{#tag:ref|
While the world's attention was focused on Hopewell from which the first press dispatches emanated about the kidnapping, ''[[The Hunterdon County Democrat]]'' made sure its readers knew that the new home of Col. Charles A. Lindbergh and Anne Morrow Lindbergh was in East Amwell Township Hunterdon County.<ref>Gill, Barbara. [http://www.nj.com/lindbergh/hunterdon/index.ssf?/lindbergh/stories/demcovr.html "Lindbergh kidnapping rocked the world 50 years ago."] ''[[The Hunterdon County Democrat]],'' 1981.</ref>|group=lower-alpha}} Arriving at the Lindbergh home police began the first search into the disappearance of young Charles Augustus Lindbergh Jr., there police witnessed two clear sets of footprints outside of the Lindbergh home. One set specifically led southeast towards a ladder that was believed to be used in the abduction.  Upon the discovery of intruders, police returned inside the home to begin their initial search of the nursery.  Before calling the police Charles Lindbergh uncovered a plain white envelope located on the windowsill.  Believing it was a ransom note, Charles left it for police inspection. Expert in crime-scene photography and fingerprints, Corporal Frank Kelly, was a part of the group that was investigating the disappearance of Charles Augustus Lindbergh.  After processing the envelope for any evidence revealed a smudged fingerprint which would later be sent to the state official in charge, Major Schoeffel. Inside the envelope was a detailed ransom note from the kidnapper giving the Lindberghs guided instructions for the return of their child.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Anne Morrow Lindbergh|last=Hertog|first=Susan|publisher=Random House, Inc.|date=November 1999|isbn=978-0-385-46973-9|location=United States|pages=167–168}}</ref>

After a massive investigation, a baby's body presumed to be that of Charles Lindbergh Jr. was discovered on May 12, 1932, some 4 miles (6.5&nbsp;km) from the Lindbergh home, at the summit of a hill on the Hopewell–Mt. Rose highway.<ref>Lyman, Lauren D. "Press calls for action: Hopes the public will be roused to wipe out a 'national disgrace'." ''The New York Times,'' December 24, 1935, p. 1.</ref>

==Exile to Europe==
The press paid frenzied attention to the Lindberghs after the kidnapping of their son and the trial, conviction, and execution of [[Bruno Richard Hauptmann]] for the crime. This—and threats and press harassment of their second son Jon—prompted the family to retreat to the United Kingdom, to a house called [[Long Barn]] owned by [[Harold Nicolson]] and [[Vita Sackville-West]], and later to the small island of [[Île Illiec|Illiec]], off the coast of [[Brittany]] in France.<ref>Winters 2006, p. 193.</ref>

While in Europe during the 1930s, the Lindberghs came to advocate [[isolationism|isolationist views]] and an opposition to American involvement in the impending European conflict, which led to their fall from grace in the eyes of many and many to suspect that the couple may be Nazi sympathizers.

==Return to U.S.==
In April 1939, the Lindberghs returned to the United States. Because of his outspoken beliefs about a future war that would envelop their homeland, the antiwar [[America First Committee]] quickly adopted Charles as its leader in 1940.<ref name="Jennings and Brewer p. 420"/>

In 1940, Anne published a 41-page booklet, ''The Wave of the Future: A Confession of Faith'', which "swiftly became the No. 1 nonfiction bestseller in the country."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Olson |first1=Lynne |title=Those Angry Days |date=2013 |publisher=Random House |location=New York |page=245}}</ref> Writing in support of her husband's lobbying efforts for a U.S.-German peace treaty similar to [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler's]] [[Treaty of Non-Aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union|Non-Aggression Treaty]] with [[Joseph Stalin]],<ref name="NYTImes-2001.12.30">Plunket, Robert.

After the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] and Germany's declaration of war, the America First Committee disbanded, and Charles eventually managed to become involved in the military and enter combat only as a civilian.<ref>[http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/lindbergh2.htm "Charles Lindbergh in Combat, 1944."] ''EyeWitness to History'', 2006.

In this period, Anne met the French writer, poet and pioneering aviator [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]], author of the novella ''[[The Little Prince]]''. Though Anne found "St-Ex" attractive, the two did not have a secret affair, as is sometimes erroneously reported.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/505192 |title=Anne Lindbergh: Anne Morrow Lindbergh, a hero's co-pilot, died on February 7th, aged 94. |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |date=February 15, 2001 |access-date=January 5, 2016}}</ref>

==Later years and death==
After the war, she wrote books that helped the Lindberghs rebuild the reputations which they had lost before [[World War II]]. The publication of ''[[Gift from the Sea]]'' in 1955 earned her place as "one of the leading advocates of the nascent environmental movement" and became a national bestseller.<ref name="pbs">[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/lindbergh/sfeature/anne.html "Anne Morrow Lindbergh."] ''PBS.''

Over the course of their 45-year marriage, the Lindberghs lived in [[New Jersey]], New York, the United Kingdom, France, [[Maine]], [[Michigan]], [[Connecticut]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Hawaii]]. Charles died on the island of [[Maui]] in 1974.

According to one biographer, Anne had a three-year affair in the early 1950s with her personal doctor.<ref>Connelly, Sherryl.

According to Rudolf Schröck, author of ''Das Doppelleben des Charles A. Lindbergh'' ("The Double Life of Charles A. Lindbergh"), Anne was unaware that Charles had led a double life from 1957 until his death in 1974. His affair with Munich hat maker Brigitte Hesshaimer produced three children whom he supported financially. After Hesshaimer's passing in 2003, DNA tests conducted by the [[University of Munich]] proved that her three children were fathered by Lindbergh.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/29/world/dna-proves-lindbergh-led-a-double-life.html?ref=annemorrowlindbergh "DNA Proves Lindbergh Led a Double Life."] ''The New York Times'', November 29, 2003.

After suffering a series of [[cerebrovascular accident|strokes]] that left her confused and disabled in the early 1990s, Anne continued to live in her home in [[Connecticut]] with the assistance of round-the-clock caregivers. During a visit to her daughter Reeve's family in 1999, she came down with [[pneumonia]], after which she went to live near Reeve in a small home built on Reeve's Passumpsic, Vermont, farm, where Anne died in 2001 at 94, following another stroke.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/08/books/anne-morrow-lindbergh-94-dies-champion-of-flight-and-women-s-concerns.html|title=Anne Morrow Lindbergh, 94, Dies; Champion of Flight and Women's Concerns|first=Eric|last=Pace|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 8, 2001|access-date=October 19, 2019}}</ref> Reeve Lindbergh's book, ''No More Words'', tells the story of her mother's last years.<ref>Lindbergh, Reeve 2002, p. 175.</ref>
