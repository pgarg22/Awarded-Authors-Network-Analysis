He began writing plays such as ''[[Children (play)|Children]]'' and ''[[The Middle Ages (play)|The Middle Ages]]'' while at MIT, but it was his great success with ''[[The Dining Room]]'' that allowed him to write full-time. After ''The Dining Room'', Gurney wrote a number of plays, most of them concerning [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASPs]] of the American northeast. While at Yale, Gurney also wrote ''Love in Buffalo'', the first musical ever produced at the Yale School of Drama.<ref name="Sternlicht">{{cite book|last1=Sternlicht|first1=Sanford|title=A reader's guide to modern American drama|date=2002|publisher=Syracuse Univ.

==Literary work==
===Themes===
Gurney's plays often explore the theme of declining upper-class "WASP" ([[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant]]) life in contemporary America. ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' has called his works "penetratingly witty studies of the WASP ascendancy in retreat."<ref name="wsj"/> Several of his works are loosely based on his patrician upbringing, including ''The Cocktail Hour'' and ''Indian Blood''.<ref name="Tallmer"/>  ''The New York Times''  drama critic Frank Rich, in his review of ''The Dining Room'', wrote, "As a chronicler of contemporary America's most unfashionable social stratum — upper-middle-class WASPs, this playwright has no current theatrical peer."<ref>Quoted in Matt Schudel, "A.R. Gurney, playwright who portrayed the fading WASP culture, dies at 86" [https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/ar-gurney-playwright-who-portrayed-the-fading-wasp-culture-dies-at-86/2017/06/15/c9d640ea-51d6-11e7-b064-828ba60fbb98_story.html ''The Washington Post''  June 15, 2017]</ref>

In his 1988 play, "The Cocktail Hour", the lead character tells her playwright son that theater critics "don't like us.... They resent us. They think we're all Republicans, all superficial and all alcoholics. Only the latter is true."<ref name="wsj">For the quotes see Terry Teachout, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-cocktail-hour-review-anatomy-of-a-wasp-1452207925 "Anatomy of a WASP," ''The Wall Street Journal'' Jan 8, 2016]</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the play as witty observations about a nearly extinct patrician class that regards psychiatry as an affront to good manners, underpaid hired help as a birthright.<ref name = "NYT">{{cite web|last=Genzlinger |first=Neil |url=http://theater.nytimes.com/2008/06/10/theater/reviews/10hour.html |title=New York Times, June 10, 2008 |publisher=Theater.nytimes.com |date=2008-06-10 |access-date=2012-04-16}}</ref>

In a 1989 interview with ''The New York Times'', Gurney said, "Just as it's mentioned in ''The Cocktail Hour'',' my great-grandfather hung up his clothes one day and walked into the [[Niagara River]] and no one understood why." Gurney added that "he was a distinguished man in Buffalo. My father could never mention it, and it affected the family well into the fourth generation as a dark and unexplainable gesture. It made my father and his father desperate to be accepted, to be conventional, and comfortable. It made them commit themselves to an ostensibly easy bourgeois world. They saw it so precariously, but the reason was never mentioned. I first learned about it after my father died."<ref name="NYTReview"/>

Gurney told ''The Washington Post'' in 1982:
:WASPs do have a culture — traditions, idiosyncrasies, quirks, particular signals and totems we pass on to one another.  But the WASP culture, or at least that aspect of the culture I talk about, is enough in the past so that we can now look at it with some objectivity, smile at it, and even appreciate some of its values. There was a closeness of family, a commitment to duty, to stoic responsibility, which I think we have to say weren't entirely bad."<ref>Matt Schudel, "A.R. Gurney, playwright who portrayed the fading WASP culture, dies at 86"</ref>
