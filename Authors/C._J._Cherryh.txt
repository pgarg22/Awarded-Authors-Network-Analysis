'''Carolyn Janice Cherry''' (born September 1, 1942), better known by the [[pen name]] '''C. J. Cherryh''', is an American writer of [[speculative fiction]]. She has written more than 80 books since the mid-1970s, including the [[Hugo Award]]-winning novels ''[[Downbelow Station]]'' (1981) and ''[[Cyteen]]'' (1988), both set in her [[Alliance–Union universe]], and her [[Foreigner universe|''Foreigner'' universe]]. She is known for [[worldbuilding]], depicting fictional realms with great realism supported by vast research in history, language, psychology, and archeology.

Cherryh (pronounced "Cherry") appended a silent "h" to her real name because her first editor, [[Donald A. Wollheim]], felt that "Cherry" sounded too much like a [[Romance novel|romance]] writer.<ref>[http://www.faqs.org/faqs/sf/written-faq rec.arts.sf.written FAQ]. ''Pronunciation of Cherryh''.</ref> She used only her initials, C.J., to disguise that she was female at a time when the majority of science fiction authors were male.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bj9Jbnak3S0C&pg=PA19|title = The Cherryh Odyssey |title-link=The Cherryh Odyssey |last = Gunn|first = James|author-link = James E.

The author has an [[asteroid]], [[77185 Cherryh]], named after her. Referring to this honor, the asteroid's discoverers wrote of Cherryh: "She has challenged us to be worthy of the stars by imagining how mankind might grow to live among them."<ref>[http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=77185 JPL Small-Body Database Browser] ''Asteroid 77185 Cherryh''.</ref>

==Biography==
{{BLP sources section|date=September 2014}}
Cherryh was born in 1942 in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] and raised primarily in [[Lawton, Oklahoma]]. She began writing stories at the age of ten when she became frustrated with the cancellation of her favorite TV show, ''[[Flash Gordon#Television|Flash Gordon]]''. In 1964, she received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[Latin]] from the [[University of Oklahoma]] ([[Phi Beta Kappa Society|Phi Beta Kappa]]), with academic specializations in [[archaeology]], [[mythology]], and the history of [[engineering]]. In 1965, she received a [[Master of Arts]] degree in [[classics]] from [[Johns Hopkins University]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], where she was a Woodrow Wilson fellow.

After graduation, Cherryh taught Latin, Ancient Greek, the classics, and ancient history at [[John Marshall High School (Oklahoma)|John Marshall High School]] in the [[Oklahoma City]] public school system. While her job was teaching Latin, her passion was the history, religion, and culture of Rome and Ancient Greece.  During the summers, she would conduct student tours of the ancient ruins in England, France, Spain, and Italy.  In her spare time, she would write, using the [[Roman mythology|mythology of Rome]] and [[Greek mythology|Greece]] as plots for her stories of the future.  Cherryh did not follow the professional path typical of science fiction writers at the time, which was to first publish [[short story|short stories]] in science fiction and fantasy magazines and then progress to novels; she did not consider writing short stories until she had had several novels published.

Cherryh wrote novels in her spare time away from teaching and submitted these manuscripts directly for publication. Initially, she met with little success; indeed various publishers lost manuscripts she had submitted. She was thus forced to retype them from her own carbon copies, time-consuming but cheaper than paying for [[photocopier|photocopying]]. (Using [[carbon paper]] to make at least one copy of a manuscript was standard practice until the advent of the [[personal computer]].)

Cherryh's breakthrough came in 1975 when [[Donald A. Wollheim]] purchased the two manuscripts she had submitted to [[DAW Books]], ''[[Gate of Ivrel]]'' and ''[[Brothers of Earth]]''. About the former, Cherryh stated in an interview on ''[[Amazing Stories]]''

<blockquote>It was the first time a book really found an ending and really worked, because I had made contact with Don Wollheim at DAW, found him interested, and was able to write for a specific editor whose body of work and type of story I knew. It was a good match. It was a set of characters I'd invented when I was, oh, about thirteen. So it was an old favorite of my untold stories, and ended up being the first in print.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://amazingstoriesmag.com/2014/02/interview-award-winning-author-c-j-cherryh/|title = Interview with Award-Winning Author C. J. Cherryh|date = February 19, 2014|access-date = August 5, 2014|work = [[Amazing Stories]] |last = Troughton |first = R.K.}}</ref></blockquote>

The two novels were published in 1976, ''Gate of Ivrel'' preceding ''Brothers of Earth'' by several months (although she had completed and submitted ''Brothers of Earth'' first). The books won her immediate recognition and the [[John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer]] in 1977.

Although not all of her works have been published by DAW Books, during this early period Cherryh developed a strong relationship with the Wollheim family and their publishing company, frequently traveling to [[New York City]] and staying with the Wollheims in their [[Queens]] family home. Other companies that have published her novels include [[Baen Books]], [[HarperCollins]], [[Hachette Book Group USA|Warner Books]], and [[Random House]] (under its [[Del Rey Books]] imprint). She published six additional novels in the late 1970s.

In 1979, her short story "[[Cassandra (short story)|Cassandra]]" won the [[Hugo Award for Best Short Story|Best Short Story Hugo]], and she quit teaching to write full-time. She has since won the [[Hugo Award for Best Novel]] twice, first for ''Downbelow Station'' in 1982 and then again for ''Cyteen'' in 1989.

In addition to developing her own [[fictional universe]]s, Cherryh has contributed to several [[shared universe|shared world]] anthologies, including ''[[Thieves' World]]'', ''[[Heroes in Hell]]'', ''[[Elfquest]]'', ''[[Witch World]]'', ''Magic in Ithkar'', and the ''[[Merovingen Nights]]'' series, which she edited. Her writing has encompassed a variety of science fiction and fantasy subgenres and includes a few short works of non-fiction. Her books have been translated into [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], French, German, [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], Italian, [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], Spanish and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. She has also translated several published works of fiction from French into English.

She now lives near [[Spokane, Washington]], with her wife<ref name=Fancher>{{cite web|last=Fancher|first=Jane|author-link=Jane Fancher|title=Da Big Secrud!|url=http://www.janefancher.com/HarmoniesOfTheNet/2014/05/05/da-big-secrud/|date=May 5, 2014|access-date=May 7, 2014}}</ref><ref name=Fancher2>{{cite web|last=Fancher|first=Jane|author-link=Jane Fancher|title=Wedding Pix!|url=http://www.janefancher.com/HarmoniesOfTheNet/2014/05/27/wedding-pix/|date=May 27, 2014|access-date=June 22, 2014}}</ref> the science fiction/[[fantasy author]] and artist [[Jane Fancher]]. She enjoys skating, traveling and regularly makes appearances at [[science fiction convention]]s.

Her brother [[David A. Cherry]] is a science fiction and fantasy artist.

==Writing style==
Cherryh uses a writing technique she has variously labeled "very tight limited [[Grammatical person|third person]]", "intense third person", and "intense internal" voice.<ref name=EncycloCentral>{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclocentral.com/20357-C.J._Cherryh_Short_Story_Essay_Novel_Writer_.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070811162015/http://www.encyclocentral.com/20357-C.J._Cherryh_Short_Story_Essay_Novel_Writer_.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 11, 2007 |title=C.J. Cherryh Short Story Essay Novel Writer |work=EncycloCentral |access-date=February 20, 2008 }}</ref> In this approach, the only things the writer narrates are those that the viewpoint character specifically notices or thinks about.<ref name=EncycloCentral/> The narration may not mention important features of the environment or situation with which the character is already familiar, even though these things might be of interest to the reader, because the character does not think about them owing to their familiarity.

==World building==
Cherryh's works depict [[Fictional universe|fictional worlds]] with great realism supported by her strong background in [[language]]s, [[history]], [[archaeology]], and [[psychology]]. In her introduction to Cherryh's first book, [[Andre Norton]] compared the effect of the work to [[J. R. R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s: "Never since reading ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' have I been so caught up in any tale as I have been in ''[[Gate of Ivrel]]''." Another reviewer commented, "Her blend of science and folklore gives the novels an intellectual depth comparable to [[J. R. R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] or [[Gene Wolfe]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dancingbadger.com/c_j_cherryh.htm |title=C. J. Cherryh, Science Fiction, and the Soft Sciences |work=Dancing Badger |access-date=June 18, 2007}}</ref>  Cherryh creates believable [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] cultures, species, and perspectives, causing the reader to reconsider basic assumptions about [[human nature]]. Her worlds have been praised as complex and realistic because she presents them through implication rather than explication.<ref name="ladn871129">{{cite news |work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]] |title=Brilliant Literature is Unearthed in Cherryh's Novels |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=LA&p_theme=la&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EF51634C2FC9CD8&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |quote=CJ Cherryh will be the guest of honor at LOSCON 14, this year's annual convention for Los Angeles-area science fiction and fantasy fans. |date=November 29, 1987 |access-date=April 10, 2012}}</ref> She describes the difficulties of translating/expressing concepts between differing languages. This is best demonstrated in both the ''[[The Chanur novels|Chanur]]'' and ''[[Foreigner universe|Foreigner]]'' series.

She has described the process she uses to create alien societies for her fiction as being akin to asking a series of questions, and letting the answers to these questions dictate various parameters of the alien [[culture]]. In her view, "culture is how [[biology]] responds to its [[Natural environment|environment]] and makes its living conditions better." Some of the issues she considers critical to take into account in detailing an intelligent alien race are:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cherryh.com/www/worldbuilding.htm |title=Worldbuilding |work=C. J. Cherryh homepage |last=Cherryh |first=C. J. |access-date=June 18, 2007}}</ref>
* The physical [[ecosystem|environment]] in which the species lives
* The location and nature of the race's [[House|dwellings]], including the spatial relationships between those dwellings
* The species' [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]], method(s) of obtaining and consuming [[food]], and cultural practices regarding the preparation of meals and [[eating]] (if any)
* Processes which the aliens use to share [[knowledge]]
* Customs and ideas regarding [[death]], dying, the treatment of the race's dead, and the [[afterlife]] (if any)
* [[Metaphysics|Metaphysical]] issues related to [[Philosophy of self|self]]-definition and the aliens' concept of the [[fictional universe]] they inhabit

==Major themes==
{{main|Themes of C. J. Cherryh's works}}
Her protagonists often attempt to uphold existing social institutions and norms in the service of the greater good while the antagonists often attempt to exploit, subvert or radically alter the predominant social order for selfish gain. She uses the theme of the outsider finding his (or her) place in society and how individuals interact with The Other. A number of Cherryh's novels focus on military and political themes. One underlying theme of her work is an exploration of gender roles. Her characters reveal both strengths and weaknesses regardless of their gender, although her female protagonists are portrayed as especially capable and determined, and many of her male characters are portrayed as damaged, abused, or otherwise vulnerable.

==Works==
{{main|C. J. Cherryh bibliography}}

Her career began with publication of her first books in 1976, ''Gate of Ivrel'' and ''Brothers of Earth''.

J. Cherryh homepage |last=Cherryh |first=C. J. |access-date=June 18, 2007}}</ref>  Ms. Cherryh has received the Hugo, Locus, and Prometheus Awards for some of her novels.
