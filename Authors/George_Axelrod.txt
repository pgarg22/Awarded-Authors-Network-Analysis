'''George Axelrod''' (June 9, 1922 – June 21, 2003) was an American [[screenwriter]], [[Film producer|producer]], [[playwright]] and [[film director]], best known for his play ''[[The Seven Year Itch (play)|The Seven Year Itch]]'' (1952), which was adapted into a [[The Seven Year Itch|film of the same name]] starring [[Marilyn Monroe]]. Axelrod was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for his [[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|1961 adaptation]] of [[Truman Capote]]'s ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (novella)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'' and also [[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|adapted]] [[Richard Condon]]'s ''[[The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (1962).

==Early life and family==
Axelrod was born in New York City, the son of Beatrice Carpenter, a [[silent film]] actress, and Herman Axelrod, a Columbia graduate who had worked on the school's annual [[Varsity Show]] with Oscar Hammerstein and who later went into [[real estate]].<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/39/George-Axelrod.html George Axelrod Biography (1922-)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> His father was Russian Jewish and his mother was of Scottish and English descent.<ref>[http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft138nb0zm&chunk.id=d0e2422 George Axelrod Biography (1922-) University of California Press: "George Axelrod: Irony!" Interview by Pat McGilligan]</ref> He was the father of lawyer Peter Axelrod; Steven Axelrod, painting contractor and writer; [[Nina Axelrod]], actress and stepfather of screenwriter [[Jonathan Axelrod]] (who married the actress [[Illeana Douglas]]). He was a grandfather of actor [[Taliesin Jaffe]].

== Career ==

===Radio and Broadway===
Early in his career, Axelrod worked in summer stock theater as a stage manager and an occasional actor. During [[World War II]], he was a member of the [[Army Signal Corps]]. When he returned to civilian life, he wrote for ''[[The Shadow]]'', ''Midnight'', ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'', and other radio programs. With the advent of television, he wrote for that medium, too, eventually working on more than 400 TV and radio scripts. Comedians for whom he wrote included [[Jerry Lewis]] and [[Dean Martin]]<ref name=":0" /> Axelrod wrote the 1952 stage comedy, ''[[The Seven Year Itch]]'', a risqué social satire about a middle-class man who has an affair while his wife and children are on vacation. ''The Seven Year Itch'' was first presented by Courtney Burr and Elliot Nugent at the Fulton Theatre, New York City, on July 15, 1952.

===Television===
Axelrod's overnight success prompted him to write a seriocomic teleplay, ''Confessions of a Nervous Man'', starring [[Art Carney]] as a playwright waiting anxiously in a [[Theater District]] bar for the newspaper reviews of his first play to hit the streets. Based on his own experiences on the opening night of ''The Seven Year Itch'', the one-hour play was presented as the November 30, 1953, episode of ''[[Studio One (radio-TV series)|Studio One]]''. He appeared on television himself occasionally as a guest panelist on ''[[What's My Line?]]''

===Films===
The Broadway success of ''The Seven Year Itch'' led to the successful 1955 film directed by [[Billy Wilder]] and starring [[Marilyn Monroe]]. The plot was altered so that the husband ([[Tom Ewell]]) only fantasizes about having an affair.

Axelrod's next stage hit was ''[[Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? (play)|Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?]]'', a [[Faust]]ian comedy about a fan magazine writer ([[Orson Bean]]) selling his soul to the [[Devil]] (in the guise of a [[literary agent]]) to become a successful [[screenwriter]]. It ran for more than a year on Broadway in 1955–56 and received much attention in the national press thanks to its star, [[Jayne Mansfield]]. The screen rights were bought by [[20th Century Fox]], but the studio had director/screenwriter [[Frank Tashlin]] change the story to a satire on television [[advertising]] and throw out all of Axelrod's characters except Rita Marlowe (with Mansfield recreating her stage role). Axelrod was contemptuous of the [[Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?|1957 film version]], saying that he did not go to see it because the studio "never used my story, my play or my script."

In 1959–60, [[Lauren Bacall]] starred in his comic play ''Goodbye Charlie'' which ran for 109 performances, followed by [[Goodbye Charlie|a film version]] with [[Debbie Reynolds]]. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, Axelrod was one of the best paid screenwriters in Hollywood, and he was nominated for an Academy Award for his 1961 adaptation of [[Truman Capote]]'s ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (novella)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]''. He was highly regarded for his adaptation of [[Richard Condon]]'s novel for director [[John Frankenheimer]]'s Cold War thriller ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (1962) starring [[Laurence Harvey]] and [[Frank Sinatra]]. Axelrod, who co-produced, considered it his best screen adaptation. After the assassination of President [[John F. Kennedy]] in November 1963, the movie was taken out of circulation and wasn't re-released until 1988, when it became a box office hit and was deemed by critics to be a classic of American cinema.

Axelrod wrote the original screenplay for ''[[How to Murder Your Wife]]'' (1965), directed by [[Richard Quine]] with [[Jack Lemmon]], [[Virna Lisi]] and [[Terry-Thomas]]. Axelrod directed ''[[Lord Love a Duck]]'' (1966), and two years later, he directed ''[[The Secret Life of an American Wife]]'' (1968). After a decade hiatus, he returned to films providing the screenplay for an unsuccessful remake of ''[[The Lady Vanishes (1979 film)|The Lady Vanishes]]'' (1979). Subsequent contributions include the scripts for Frankenheimer's [[The Holcroft Covenant (film)|''The Holcroft Covenant'']] (1985) and [[The Fourth Protocol (film)|''The Fourth Protocol'']] (1987).

===Novels===

Axelrod was also an author of three novels: ''Blackmailer'', a comic mystery; ''Beggar's Choice'', a comedy of role reversal; and ''Where Am I Now When I Need Me?'', a humorous overview of the Hollywood scene.

==Death==
On June 21, 2003,  at the age of 81, Axelrod died quietly at his Los Angeles home.<ref name=":0">{{cite news |last1=Thurber |first1=Jon |title=George Axelrod, 81; Wrote for Radio, Stage and Screen |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/47772114/george-axelrod/ |access-date=April 1, 2020 |work=The Los Angeles Times |date=June 22, 2003 |location=California, Los Angeles |page=B 14|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> He was under hospice care after a lingering illness.
