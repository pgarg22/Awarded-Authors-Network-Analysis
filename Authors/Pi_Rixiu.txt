'''Pi Rixiu''' ({{zh|c=皮日休|p=Pí Rìxiū|w='''''P'i Jih-hsiu'''''}}; ca. 834 – 883) was a [[Tang dynasty]] poet. His [[courtesy name]]s were '''Yishao''' ({{lang|zh|逸少}}) and '''Ximei''' ({{lang|zh|袭美}}), and he wrote under the [[pen name]] '''Lumenzi''' ({{lang|zh-Hans|鹿门子}}). Pi was a contemporary of poet [[Lu Guimeng]]; these two poets are often referred to as Pi-Lu.

Pi was born at [[Xiangyang]], in modern [[Hubei]] Province. He is thought to have been of humble birth. He spent his youth traveling and writing: his verse was well known by the time he sat for the civil service exam <ref>[[Jaroslav Průšek]] and Zbigniew Słupski, eds., Dictionary of Oriental Literatures: East Asia (Charles Tuttle, 1978): 140-141.</ref> in 867, when he obtained a degree of [[Imperial examination|Jinshi]]. After traveling to [[Suzhou]] in 868, he became Suzhou magistrate in 869. Later, he participated in the defeat of the [[Huang Chao]]'s rebellion, and subsequently retired in southern China.
