'''William Thomas Moncrieff''' (24 August 1794 – 3 December 1857) commonly referred as W.T. Moncrieff was an [[English people|English]] dramatist and author.

==Biography==
He was born in [[London]], the son of a Strand tradesman named Thomas. The name Moncrieff he assumed for theatrical purposes. Moncrieff's first success was at [[Astley's Amphitheatre|Astley’s circus]] with ''The Dandy Family'' an equestrian drama, and in 1820 ''The Lear of Private Life'', with [[Junius Brutus Booth]] as hero, enjoyed a long run. He supplied [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]] with a romantic melodrama called ''The Cataract of the Ganges; or, The Rajah’s Daughter'' which gave the national theatre an opportunity of displaying upon its stage both real horses and a real waterfall. This work became very popular with performances at provincial theatres throughout England. His 1819 play, ''Wanted: a wife'', was a comedy that gently ridiculed [[personal advertisements|"lonely heart" ads]].<ref name=beauankle>{{cite book | last=Beauman | first=Fran | title=Shapely ankle preferr'd : a history of the lonely hearts ad | publisher=Chatto & Windus | publication-place=London | year=2011 | isbn=978-0-09-951334-6 | oclc=664324635 | page=81 }}</ref> In 1830, he conceived the operatic drama [[Van Diemen's Land]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-41485955|title = Van Diemen's Land : An operatic drama in three acts}}</ref> concerning the notorious bush-ranger [[Michael Howe (bushranger)|Michael Howe]]. But his most popular production was ''[[Tom and Jerry, or Life in London]]'' (1821), a dramatisation of ''[[Life in London (novel)|Life in London]]'' by [[Pierce Egan]], whose ''Boxiana'' Moncrieff had begun to publish in 1818. ''Tom and Jerry'' was an outstanding success, becoming the first play to achieve a run of 100 performances.<ref>Parker, p. 1196</ref>

In 1818, he wrote ''The visitors' new guide to the spa of Leamington Priors and its vicinity''.<ref>William Thomas Moncrieff {{google books|_rMHAAAAQAAJ|The visitors' new guide to the spa of Leamington Priors and its vicinity}}</ref> Then in 1824, he wrote ''Excursion to Warwick'',<ref>William Thomas Moncrieff {{google books|sUAuAAAAYAAJ|Excursion to Warwick, with an Historical Account of the Town from the earliest Periods, the great Fire in 1694, Modern Improvements, Description and History of Saint Mary's Church, Beauchamp Chapel, Saint Nicholas Church, Leicester Hospital, the Priory, History, and description of Warwick Castle,(1824)|page=46}}</ref> and also, ''Excursion to Stratford upon Avon, ... with a compendious life of Shakspeare, ... account of the ...

He managed [[Vauxhall Gardens]] in 1827 and in 1833 leased the City Theatre. His play ''[[Samuel Weller, or, The Pickwickians]]'' was performed in London in 1837 starring [[W. J. Hammond]] as [[Sam Weller (character)|Sam Weller]] while [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]] was still writing ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]''. In 1837, he also had a very public feud with Dickens, over Montcrieff's unauthorised staging of Dicken's play ''Nicholas Nickleby''.<ref>Andrew Mangham (Editor) {{google books|rQZCAQAAQBAJ| The Cambridge Companion to Sensation Fiction (2013)|page=56}}</ref>

Soon afterward his sight failed, and in 1843 he became totally blind. The following year he entered the [[London Charterhouse|Charterhouse]] in London. Moncrieff's theatrical reminiscences were published in the ''Sunday Times'' in 1851.  He edited ''Selections from Dramatic Works'' (London, 1850), containing 24 of his own plays.
