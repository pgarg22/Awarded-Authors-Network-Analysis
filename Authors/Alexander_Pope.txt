===Early life===
[[File:Alexander Pope portrait.jpg|thumb|Early portrait.]]
Alexander Pope was born in London on 21 May 1688, the year of the [[Glorious Revolution]]. His father (also Alexander, 1646–1717) was a successful linen merchant in the [[Strand, London|Strand]]. The poet's mother, Edith (1643–1733), was the daughter of William Turner, Esquire, of [[York]]. Both parents were [[Catholic Church|Catholics]].<ref name="Erskine-Hill, DNB"/> Edith's sister, Christiana, was the wife of famous miniature painter [[Samuel Cooper]]. Pope's education was affected by the recently enacted [[Test Act]]s, which upheld the status of the [[state church|established]] [[Church of England]] and banned Catholics from teaching, attending a university, voting, and holding public office on penalty of perpetual imprisonment. Pope was taught to read by his aunt and went to [[Twyford School]] in about 1698/99.<ref name="Erskine-Hill, DNB"/> He then went on to two Roman Catholic schools in London.<ref name="Erskine-Hill, DNB"/> Such schools, though still illegal, were tolerated in some areas.<ref name="Alexander Pope' 2000">"Alexander Pope", ''Literature Online biography'' (Chadwyck-Healey: Cambridge, 2000).

In 1700, his family moved to a small estate at [[Popeswood]] in [[Binfield]], Berkshire, close to the royal [[Windsor Great Park|Windsor Forest]].<ref name="Erskine-Hill, DNB"/> This was due to strong anti-Catholic sentiment and a statute preventing "Papists" from living within {{convert|10|mi|km}} of London or Westminster.<ref>"An Act to prevent and avoid dangers which may grow by Popish Recusants" (3. Jac. 1, v). For details, see ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', "[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11611c.htm Penal Laws]".</ref> Pope would later describe the countryside around the house in his poem ''Windsor Forest''.<ref name="WF">Pope, Alexander. [http://www.eighteenthcenturypoetry.org/works/o3704-w0010.shtml ''Windsor-Forest'']. Eighteenth-Century Poetry Archive (ECPA).</ref> Pope's formal education ended at this time, and from then on, he mostly educated himself by reading the works of classical writers such as the [[Satire|satirists]] [[Horace]] and [[Juvenal]], the [[Epic poetry|epic poets]] [[Homer]] and [[Virgil]], as well as English authors such as [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], [[William Shakespeare]] and [[John Dryden]].<ref name="Erskine-Hill, DNB"/> He studied many languages, reading works by French, Italian, Latin, and Greek poets. After five years of study, Pope came into contact with figures from London literary society such as [[William Congreve]], [[Samuel Garth]] and [[William Trumbull]].<ref name="Erskine-Hill, DNB"/><ref name="Alexander Pope' 2000"/>

At Binfield he made many important friends. One of them, [[John Caryll the younger|John Caryll]] (the future dedicatee of ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]''), was twenty years older than the poet and had made many acquaintances in the London literary world. He introduced the young Pope to the ageing playwright [[William Wycherley]] and to [[William Walsh (poet)|William Walsh]], a minor poet, who helped Pope revise his first major work, ''The Pastorals''. He also met the Blount sisters, Teresa and [[Martha Blount|Martha]], both of whom remained lifelong friends.<ref name="Alexander Pope' 2000"/>

From the age of 12 he suffered numerous health problems, including [[Pott disease]], a form of [[tuberculosis]] that affects the spine, which deformed his body and stunted his growth, leaving him with a severe hunchback. His tuberculosis infection caused other health problems including respiratory difficulties, high fevers, inflamed eyes and abdominal pain.<ref name="Erskine-Hill, DNB"/> He grew to a height of only {{height|ft=4|in=6|abbr=no}}. Pope was already removed from society as a Catholic, and his poor health alienated him further. Although he never married, he had many female friends to whom he wrote witty letters, including [[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]]. It has been alleged that his lifelong friend Martha Blount was his lover.<ref name="Alexander Pope' 2000"/><ref name="Gordon 2002"/><ref name="Mount"/><ref>''The Life of Alexander Pope'', by [[Robert Carruthers]], 1857, with a corrupted and badly scanned version available [https://archive.org/details/lifealexanderpo00carrgoog from Internet Archive], or as an [https://archive.org/details/lifealexanderpo00carrgoog even worse 23MB PDF].

===Early career===
[[File:Alexander Pope's house wall plaque Twickenham.jpg|thumb|Plaque above [[Pope's Grotto]] at Twickenham]]

In May 1709, Pope's ''Pastorals'' was published in the sixth part of bookseller [[Jacob Tonson]]'s ''Poetical Miscellanies''. This earned Pope instant fame and was followed by ''[[An Essay on Criticism]]'', published in May 1711, which was equally well received.

[[File:Alexander Pope's house at Twickenham.png|thumb|left|[[Pope's villa]] at [[Twickenham]], showing the [[grotto]]; from a watercolour produced soon after his death]]

Around 1711, Pope made friends with Tory writers [[Jonathan Swift]], [[Thomas Parnell]] and [[John Arbuthnot]], who together formed the satirical [[Scriblerus Club]]. Its aim was to satirise ignorance and pedantry through the fictional scholar Martinus Scriblerus. He also made friends with [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] writers [[Joseph Addison]] and [[Richard Steele]]. In March 1713, ''Windsor Forest''<ref name="WF"/> was published to great acclaim.<ref name="Alexander Pope' 2000"/>

During Pope's friendship with Joseph Addison, he contributed to Addison's play ''[[Cato, a Tragedy|Cato]]'', as well as writing for ''[[The Guardian (1713)|The Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]''. Around this time, he began the work of translating the ''[[Iliad]]'', which was a painstaking process – publication began in 1715 and did not end until 1720.<ref name="Alexander Pope' 2000"/>

In 1714 the political situation worsened with the death of Queen Anne and the disputed succession between the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverians]] and the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], leading to the [[Jacobite rising of 1715]]. Though Pope, as a Catholic, might have been expected to have supported the Jacobites because of his religious and political affiliations, according to Maynard Mack, "where Pope himself stood on these matters can probably never be confidently known". These events led to an immediate downturn in the fortunes of the [[Tories (British political party)|Tories]], and Pope's friend [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke]], fled to France.

Pope lived in his parents' house in Mawson Row, [[Chiswick]], between 1716 and 1719; the red-brick building is now the ''[[Mawson Arms]]'', commemorating him with a [[blue plaque]].<ref name="ChiswickHistory">{{Cite web |url=http://chiswickhistory.org.uk/html/110-people.html |title=Chiswick History |publisher=chiswickhistory.org.uk |work=People: Alexander Pope |access-date=16 March 2012 |author=Clegg, Gillian}}</ref>

The money made from his translation of Homer allowed Pope to move in 1719 to [[Pope's villa|a villa at Twickenham]], where he created his now famous [[Pope's Grotto|grotto]] and gardens. The serendipitous discovery of a spring during the excavation of the subterranean retreat enabled it to be filled with the relaxing sound of trickling water, which would quietly echo around the chambers. Pope was said to have remarked, "Were it to have nymphs as well – it would be complete in everything." Although the house and gardens have long since been demolished, much of the grotto survives beneath Radnor House Independent Co-educational School.<ref name="Gordon 2002"/><ref>''[[London Evening Standard]]'', 2 November 2010.</ref> The grotto has been restored and will open to the public for 30 weekends a year from 2023 under the auspices of Pope's Grotto Preservation Trust.<ref>{{Cite news |title=The secrets and lights of Alexander Pope's Twickenham grotto |url=https://www.ft.com/content/6a06cfab-1be7-432e-9aab-3c7ba501ac28 |url-status=live |access-date=2021-07-24 |newspaper=Financial Times|date=23 July 2021 |last1=Fox |first1=Robin Lane }}</ref>

===''Essay on Criticism''===
{{main|An Essay on Criticism}}
''[[An Essay on Criticism]]'' was first published anonymously on 15 May 1711. Pope began writing the poem early in his career and took about three years to finish it.

At the time the poem was published, its [[heroic couplet]] style was quite a new poetic form and Pope's work an ambitious attempt to identify and refine his own positions as a poet and critic. It was said to be a response to an ongoing debate on the question of whether poetry should be natural, or written according to predetermined artificial rules inherited from the classical past.<ref name="Rogers 2006"/>

The "essay" begins with a discussion of the standard rules that govern poetry, by which a critic passes judgement. Pope comments on the classical authors who dealt with such standards and the authority he believed should be accredited to them. He discusses the laws to which a critic should adhere while analysing poetry, pointing out the important function critics perform in aiding poets with their works, as opposed to simply attacking them.<ref name="Baines 2001"/> The final section of ''An Essay on Criticism'' discusses the moral qualities and virtues inherent in an ideal critic, who Pope claims is also the ideal man.

===''The Rape of the Lock''===
Pope's most famous poem is ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'', first published in 1712, with a revised version in 1714. A [[mock-epic]], it satirises a high-society quarrel between [[Arabella Fermor]] (the "Belinda" of the poem) and [[Robert Petre, 7th Baron Petre|Lord Petre]], who had snipped a lock of hair from her head without permission. The satirical style is tempered, however, by a genuine, almost voyeuristic interest in the "beau-monde" (fashionable world) of 18th-century society.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.english-literature.org/essays/alexander-pope.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531103412/http://www.english-literature.org/essays/alexander-pope.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=31 May 2008 |title=from the London School of Journalism.}}</ref> The revised, extended version of the poem focuses more clearly on its true subject – the onset of acquisitive individualism and a society of conspicuous consumers. In the poem, purchased artefacts displace human agency and "trivial things" come to dominate.<ref>Colin Nicholson (1994). ''Writing and the Rise of Finance: Capital Satires of the Early Eighteenth Century'', Cambridge.</ref>

===''The Dunciad'' and ''Moral Essays''===
[[File:Alexander Pope circa 1736.jpeg|thumb|upright|Alexander Pope, painting attributed to English painter [[Jonathan Richardson]], c. 1736, [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]]]

Though ''[[The Dunciad]]'' first appeared anonymously in [[Dublin]], its authorship was not in doubt. Pope pilloried a host of other "hacks", "scribblers" and "dunces" in addition to Theobald, and Maynard Mack has accordingly called its publication "in many ways the greatest act of folly in Pope's life". Though a masterpiece due to having become "one of the most challenging and distinctive works in the history of English poetry", writes Mack, "it bore bitter fruit. It brought the poet in his own time the hostility of its victims and their sympathizers, who pursued him implacably from then on with a few damaging truths and a host of slanders and lies."<ref>Maynard Mack (1985). ''Alexander Pope: A Life''. W. W. Norton & Company, and [[Yale University Press]], pp. 472–473. {{ISBN|0393305295}}</ref>

According to his half-sister Magdalen Rackett, some of Pope's targets were so enraged by ''The Dunciad'' that they threatened him physically. "My brother does not seem to know what fear is," she told [[Joseph Spence (author)|Joseph Spence]], explaining that Pope loved to walk alone, so went accompanied by his [[Great Dane]] Bounce, and for some time carried pistols in his pocket.<ref>Joseph Spence. [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015030979424;view=1up;seq=52 ''Observations, Anecdotes, and Characters of Books and Men, Collected from the Conversation of Mr. Pope'' (1820), p. 38].</ref> This first ''Dunciad'', along with [[John Gay]]'s ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' and Jonathan Swift's ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', joined in a concerted propaganda assault against [[Robert Walpole]]'s Whig ministry and the financial revolution it stabilised. Although Pope was a keen participant in the stock and money markets, he never missed a chance to satirise the personal, social and political effects of the new scheme of things. From ''The Rape of the Lock'' onwards, these satirical themes appear constantly in his work.

In 1731, Pope published his "Epistle to [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Burlington]]," on the subject of architecture, the first of four poems later grouped as the ''[[Moral Essays]]'' (1731–1735).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&UID=3487|title=Moral Essays}}</ref> The epistle ridicules the bad taste of the aristocrat "Timon".<ref name="Moral Essays">Alexander Pope. [https://www.google.ca/books/edition/Moral_Essays/ZTQjrVbjerwC?hl=en&gbpv=1 ''Moral Essays''], p. 82</ref> For example, the following are verses 99 and 100 of the Epistle:

{{blockquote
|At Timon's Villa let us paſs a day,<br>Where all cry out, "What ſums are thrown away!"<ref name="Moral Essays"/>
}}

Pope's foes claimed he was attacking the [[James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos|Duke of Chandos]] and his estate, [[Cannons (house)|Cannons]]. Though the charge was untrue, it did much damage to Pope.

===''An Essay on Man''===
{{main|An Essay on Man}}
''[[An Essay on Man]]'' is a philosophical poem in heroic couplets published between 1732 and 1734. Pope meant it as the centrepiece of a proposed system of ethics to be put forth in poetic form. It was a piece that sought to make into a larger work, but he did not live to complete it.<ref name="Nuttal 1984"/> It
attempts to "vindicate the ways of God to Man", a variation on Milton's attempt in ''Paradise Lost'' to "justify the ways of God to Man" (1.26). It challenges as prideful an anthropocentric world-view. The poem is not solely Christian, however. It assumes that man has fallen and must seek his own salvation.<ref name="Nuttal 1984"/>

[[File:Alexander Pope.jpg|left|thumb|Alexander Pope circa 1742]]
Consisting of four epistles addressed to [[Lord Bolingbroke]], it presents an idea on Pope's view of the Universe: no matter how imperfect, complex, inscrutable and disturbing the Universe may be, it functions in a rational fashion according to natural laws, so that the Universe as a whole is a perfect work of God, though to humans it appears to be evil and imperfect in many ways. Pope ascribes this to our limited mind-set and intellectual capacity. He argues that humans must accept their position in the "Great Chain of Being", at a middle stage between the angels and the beasts of the world. Accomplish this and we potentially could lead happy and virtuous lives.<ref name="Nuttal 1984"/>

The poem is an affirmative statement of faith: life seems chaotic and confusing to man in the centre of it, but according to Pope it is truly divinely ordered. In Pope's world, God exists and is what he centres the Universe around as an ordered structure. The limited intelligence of man can only take in tiny portions of this order and experience only partial truths, hence man must rely on hope, which then leads to faith. Man must be aware of his existence in the Universe and what he brings to it in terms of riches, power and fame. Pope proclaims that man's duty is to strive to be good, regardless of other situations.<ref name="Cassirer"/>

===Later life and works===
[[File:Alexander Pope dying.png|thumb|The death of Alexander Pope from ''Museus'', a [[threnody]] by [[William Mason (poet)|William Mason]]. [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] holds the dying Pope, and [[John Milton]], [[Edmund Spenser]], and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] prepare to welcome him to heaven.]]

The ''Imitations of Horace'' that followed (1733–1738) were written in the popular Augustan form of an "imitation" of a classical poet, not so much a translation of his works as an updating with contemporary references. Pope used the model of [[Horace]] to satirise life under [[George II of Great Britain|George II]], especially what he saw as the widespread corruption tainting the country under Walpole's influence and the poor quality of the court's artistic taste. Pope added as an introduction to ''Imitations'' a wholly original poem that reviews his own literary career and includes famous portraits of Lord [[John Hervey, 2nd Baron Hervey|Hervey]] ("[[Sporus]]"), [[Thomas Hay, 9th Earl of Kinnoull]] ("Balbus") and Addison ("Atticus").

In 1738 came the ''Universal Prayer''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/pope_a/prayer.html |title=Alexander Pope 'Universal Prayer' |author=McKeown, Trevor W. |work=bcy.ca}} [http://www.eighteenthcenturypoetry.org/works/o3702-w0010.shtml Full-text]. Also at the Eighteenth-Century Poetry Archive (ECPA).</ref>

Among the younger poets whose work Pope admired was [[Joseph Thurston (poet)|Joseph Thurston]].<ref>James Sambrook (2004) "Thurston, Josephlocked (1704–1732)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''. Oxford University Press. {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/70938}}</ref> After 1738, Pope himself wrote little. He toyed with the idea of composing a patriotic epic in blank verse called ''Brutus'', but only the opening lines survive. His major work in those years was to revise and expand his masterpiece, ''The Dunciad''. Book Four appeared in 1742 and a full revision of the whole poem the following year. Here Pope replaced the "hero" Lewis Theobald with the [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]], [[Colley Cibber]] as "king of dunces". However, the real focus of the revised poem is Walpole and his works. By now Pope's health, which had never been good, was failing. When told by his physician, on the morning of his death, that he was better, Pope replied: "Here am I, dying of a hundred good symptoms."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ruffhead |first=Owen |title=The Life of Alexander Pope; With a Critical Essay on His Writings and Genius |url=https://archive.org/details/lifealexanderpo00ruffgoog |year=1769 |page=[https://archive.org/details/lifealexanderpo00ruffgoog/page/n479 475]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Dyce |first=Alexander |title=The Poetical Works of Alexander Pope, with a Life, by A. Dyce |year=1863 |page=cxxxi}}</ref> He died at his villa surrounded by friends on 30 May 1744, about eleven o'clock at night. On the previous day, 29 May 1744, Pope had called for a priest and received the [[Last Rites]] of the Catholic Church. He was buried in the nave of [[St Mary's Church, Twickenham]].

==Translations and editions==
===The ''Iliad''===
Pope had been fascinated by Homer since childhood. In 1713, he announced plans to publish a translation of the ''[[Iliad]]''. The work would be available by subscription, with one volume appearing every year over six years. Pope secured a revolutionary deal with the publisher Bernard Lintot, which earned him 200 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] (£210) a volume, a vast sum at the time.

His ''Iliad'' translation appeared between 1715 and 1720. It was acclaimed by [[Samuel Johnson]] as "a performance which no age or nation could hope to equal" (though the classical scholar [[Richard Bentley]] wrote: "It is a pretty poem, Mr. Pope, but you must not call it Homer.")<ref>{{Cite book |last=Johnson |first=Samuel |url=https://www.google.ca/books/edition/The_Lives_of_the_English_Poets_and_a_cri/xWDDZ4QaA8gC?hl=en&gbpv=0 |title=The Lives of the Most Eminent Poets with Critical Observations on their Works|publisher=Printed for J.

===The ''Odyssey''===
[[File:OdysseyPopeTP1752.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece and title page of a 1752 edition of Pope's ''Odyssey''|alt=]]
Encouraged by the success of the ''Iliad'', Bernard Lintot published Pope's five-volume translation of Homer's ''Odyssey'' in 1725–1726.<ref>{{Cite book |author=Homer |name-list-style=amp |translator1=Alexander Pope |translator2=William Broome |translator3=Elijah Fenton |title=The Odyssey of Homer |edition=1st |date=1725–1726 |location=London |publisher=Bernard Lintot}}</ref> For this Pope collaborated with [[William Broome]] and [[Elijah Fenton]]: Broome translated eight books (2, 6, 8, 11, 12, 16, 18, 23), Fenton four (1, 4, 19, 20) and Pope the remaining 12.

===Shakespeare's works===
In this period, Pope was employed by the publisher [[Jacob Tonson]] to produce an opulent new edition of Shakespeare.<ref name="Pope-Shakespeare-Tonson">{{Cite web |title=Preface to Shakespeare, 1725, Alexander Pope |url=https://shakespearebrasileiro.org/en/preface-to-shakespeare-1725-alexander-pope/ |website=ShakespeareBrasileiro |access-date=10 March 2020}}</ref> When it appeared in 1725, it silently regularised Shakespeare's metre and rewrote his verse in several places. Pope also removed about 1,560 lines of Shakespeare's material, arguing that some appealed to him more than others.<ref name="Pope-Shakespeare-Tonson"/> In 1726, the lawyer, poet and pantomime-deviser [[Lewis Theobald]] published a scathing pamphlet called ''Shakespeare Restored'', which catalogued the errors in Pope's work and suggested several revisions to the text. This enraged Pope, wherefore Theobald became the main target of Pope's ''Dunciad''.<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lewis-Theobald#ref59272 "Lewis Theobald"] ''Encyclopaedia Britannica''.</ref>

The second edition of Pope's ''Shakespeare'' appeared in 1728.<ref name="Pope-Shakespeare-Tonson"/> Apart from some minor revisions to the preface, it seems that Pope had little to do with it. Most later 18th-century editors of Shakespeare dismissed Pope's creatively motivated approach to textual criticism. Pope's preface continued to be highly rated. It was suggested that Shakespeare's texts were thoroughly contaminated by actors' interpolations and they would influence editors for most of the 18th century.

==Spirit, skill and satire==
[[File:Jonathan Richardson the Elder - Alexander Pope - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of Alexander Pope by [[Jonathan Richardson]] (1738)]]
Pope's poetic career testifies to an indomitable spirit despite disadvantages of health and circumstance. The poet and his family were [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] and so fell subject to the prohibitive [[Test Act]]s, which hampered their co-religionists after the abdication of [[James II of England|James II]]. One of these banned them from living within ten miles of London, another from attending public school or university. So except for a few spurious Catholic schools, Pope was largely self-educated. He was taught to read by his aunt and became a book lover, reading in French, Italian, Latin and Greek and discovering Homer at the age of six. In 1700, when only twelve years of age, he wrote his poem ''[[Ode on Solitude]]''.<ref>''Genetic studies of genius''

He also suffered from crippling headaches.

In the year 1709, Pope showcased his precocious metrical skill with the publication of ''Pastorals'', his first major poems. They earned him instant fame. By the age of 23 he had written ''[[An Essay on Criticism]]'', released in 1711. A kind of poetic manifesto in the vein of [[Horace]]'s ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'', it met with enthusiastic attention and won Pope a wider circle of prominent friends, notably [[Joseph Addison]] and [[Richard Steele]], who had recently begun to collaborate on the influential ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]''. The critic [[John Dennis (dramatist)|John Dennis]], having found an ironic and veiled portrait of himself, was outraged by what he saw as the impudence of a younger author. Dennis hated Pope for the rest of his life, and save for a temporary reconciliation, dedicated his efforts to insulting him in print, to which Pope retaliated in kind, making Dennis the butt of much satire.

A folio containing a collection of his poems appeared in 1717, along with two new ones about the passion of love: ''Verses to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady'' and the famous proto-romantic poem ''[[Eloisa to Abelard]]''. Though Pope never married, about this time he became strongly attached to Lady M. Montagu, whom he indirectly referenced in his popular ''Eloisa to Abelard'', and to Martha Blount, with whom his friendship continued through his life.

As a [[satirist]], Pope made his share of enemies as critics, politicians and certain other prominent figures felt the sting of his sharp-witted satires. Some were so virulent that Pope even carried pistols while walking his dog. In 1738 and thenceforth, Pope composed relatively little. He began having ideas of a patriotic epic in [[blank verse]] titled ''Brutus'', but mainly revised and expanded his ''Dunciad''. Book Four appeared in 1742; and a complete revision of the whole in the year that followed. At this time Lewis Theobald was replaced with the [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]] [[Colley Cibber]] as "king of dunces", but his real target remained the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] politician [[Robert Walpole]].

==Reception==
By the mid-18th century, new fashions in poetry emerged. A decade after Pope's death, Joseph Warton claimed that Pope's style was not the most excellent form of the art. The Romantic movement that rose to prominence in early 19th-century England was more ambivalent about his work. Though [[Lord Byron]] identified Pope as one of his chief influences – believing his own scathing satire of contemporary English literature ''English Bards and Scotch Reviewers'' to be a continuance of Pope's tradition – [[William Wordsworth]] found Pope's style too decadent to represent the human condition.<ref name="Alexander Pope' 2000"/> George Gilfillan in an 1856 study called Pope's talent "a rose peering into the summer air, fine, rather than powerful".<ref>George Gilfillan (1856) "The Genius and Poetry of Pope", ''The Poetical Works of Alexander Pope'', Vol. 11.</ref>

Pope's reputation revived in the 20th century. His work was full of references to the people and places of his time, which aided people's understanding of the past. The post-war period stressed the power of Pope's poetry, recognising that Pope's immersion in Christian and Biblical culture lent depth to his poetry. For example, Maynard Mack, in the late 20th-century, argued that Pope's moral vision demanded as much respect as his technical excellence. Between 1953 and 1967 the definitive Twickenham edition of Pope's poems appeared in ten volumes, including an index volume.<ref name="Alexander Pope' 2000"/>
