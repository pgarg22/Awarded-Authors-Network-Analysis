'''Christopher John Sansom''' is a British writer of [[Historical mystery|historical crime]] novels. He was born in 1952 in [[Edinburgh]] and attended [[George Watson's College]] in that city, but left the school with no qualifications. Sansom has written about the bullying he suffered there.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/cj-sansom-ten-years-at-george-watsons-college-nearly-killed-me-half-a-century-on-i-fear-its-still-a-bullies-playground-xqtjjvpfl | work=The Times | first=C.J. | last=Sansom | title=CJ Sansom: Ten years at George Watson’s College nearly killed me. Half a century on, I fear it’s still a bullies’ playground | date=6 May 2018}}</ref> Subsequently he was educated at the [[University of Birmingham]], where he took a BA and then a PhD in history.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/nov/15/cj-sansom-interview | work=The Guardian | first=Sarah | last=Crown | title=CJ Sansom: a life in writing | date=15 November 2010}}</ref> After working in a variety of jobs, he decided to retrain as a solicitor. He practised in [[Sussex]] as a lawyer for the disadvantaged, before leaving the legal profession to become a full-time writer.  He lives in Sussex.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

==Work==
Sansom came to prominence with the [[Shardlake series]], his [[historical mystery]] series set in the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] in the 16th century.  The series' main character is the [[kyphosis|hunchback]]ed lawyer Matthew Shardlake, who is assisted in his adventures by Mark Poer, then Jack Barak and also Nicholas Overton. Shardlake works on commission initially from [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]] in ''[[Dissolution (C. J. Sansom novel)|Dissolution]]'' and ''[[Dark Fire (C. J. Sansom novel)|Dark Fire]]'', then Archbishop [[Thomas Cranmer]] in ''[[Sovereign (Sansom novel)|Sovereign]]'' and ''[[Revelation (Sansom novel)|Revelation]]'', Queen [[Catherine Parr]] in ''[[Heartstone (novel)|Heartstone]]'' and ''[[Lamentation (C. J. Sansom novel)|Lamentation]]'' and finally [[Elizabeth I|Princess Elizabeth]] in [[Tombland]]. ''Dark Fire'' won the 2005 Crime Writers' Association Historical Dagger.

After ''Dark Fire'' was published, a ''Sunday Times'' review made this comment: "Historical crime fiction is sometimes little more than a modern adventure in fancy dress. Not so the novels of CJ Sansom, whose magnificent books set in the reign of Henry VIII bring to life the sounds and smells of Tudor England..."<ref>[http://www.greeneheaton.co.uk/pages/authors/title.asp?AuthorID=20&TitleID=86 C. J. Sansom] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815194515/http://www.greeneheaton.co.uk/pages/authors/title.asp?AuthorID=20&TitleID=86 |date=15 August 2007 }} article at Greene Heaton.</ref>

Shardlake works as a lawyer in the service of Henry's younger daughter, the Lady Elizabeth, in the novel ''[[Tombland]]'' (published in 2018), investigating a murder during the time of [[Kett's Rebellion]] in Norfolk. "Tombland is more of a grand historical epic than a tightly packed whodunnit, like some of the earlier novels; but 800 pages in Shardlake’s company will always fly by".
<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/28/tombland-cj-sansom-review, Tombland Review</ref> ''[[Dissolution (C. J. Sansom novel)|Dissolution]]'' was adapted in 10 episodes for [[BBC Radio 4]] in September 2012, and ''Revelation'' in March 2017.

Sansom explained his reasons for making his protagonist a barrister, in an interview with [[The Guardian]].<blockquote>"I thought it made sense for Shardlake to be a lawyer for a number of reasons. First, the law was my profession: I find legal practice endlessly interesting. Second, it existed then and now, so it provides a point of contact for readers. And third, it's democratic: it offers a way into any number of mysteries, and puts Shardlake in the way of an endless variety of characters."</blockquote> Sansom also said that he plans to write further Shardlake novels taking the lawyer into the reign of Elizabeth I.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

He has also written ''[[Winter in Madrid]]'', a thriller set in Spain in 1940 in the aftermath of the [[Spanish Civil War]] and ''[[Dominion (Sansom novel)|Dominion]]'', an [[alternate history]] novel set in a Britain following a fictional [[Axis victory in World War II]]. About the latter novel, a Guardian review called the premise "an invented mid-20th century Britain that has the intricate detail and delineation of JRR Tolkien's Middle Earth, though thankfully described in better prose".<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/dec/06/dominion-cj-sansom-review, Dominion by CJ Sansom – review</ref>

==Awards==
''Dark Fire'' won the 2005 [[Edith Pargeter|Ellis Peters]] Historical Dagger, awarded by the [[Crime Writers' Association]] (CWA).  Sansom himself was "Very Highly Commended" in the 2007 CWA [[Dagger in the Library]] award, for the Shardlake series.<ref>[http://www.thecwa.co.uk/daggers/2007/library.html the CWA Dagger in the Library 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915062709/http://www.thecwa.co.uk/daggers/2007/library.html |date=15 September 2007 }} – C.J. Sansom shortlisted for the Duncan Lawrie Dagger Award.</ref> ''Dominion'' won the [[Sidewise Award for Alternate History]].<ref>[http://www.sfsite.com/news/2013/07/01/sidewise-award-nominees-3/ Sidewise Award Nominees], ''SF Site News'', 1 July 2013.</ref>

==Politics==
Sansom was born in Scotland. He strongly opposes [[Scottish independence]] and described the prospect as "literally heartbreaking".<ref name="glasgow herald">{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/scots-author-condemns-dangerous-snp-in-book.19134105 |title=Scots author condemns 'dangerous' SNP in book |author=Phil Miller
|date= 13 October 2012}}</ref> In his 2012 novel ''Dominion'', his depiction of an alternate history in which Germany wins the [[Second World War]], the [[Scottish National Party]] collaborates with the British Nazi state. He stated, "A party which is often referred to by its members, as the SNP is, as the National Movement should send a chill down the spine of anyone who remembers what those words have often meant in Europe".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13076771.scots-author-condemns-dangerous-snp-in-book/|title=Scots author condemns 'dangerous' SNP in book|website=HeraldScotland}}</ref> He also pointed out that in real life, some of the party's members then had fascist sympathies.

He went on to describe the party as "deeply dangerous, with no politics in the conventional sense, believing only in the old dream that the unleashing of 'national spirit' and 'national pride' can solve a country's problems".<ref name="guardian_editorial">{{cite news |title=My nightmare of a Nazi Britain |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/19/sansom-dominion-nightmare-nazi-britain |author=CJ Sansom |newspaper=The Guardian |date=19 October 2012}}</ref> He donated £294,000 to the [[Better Together (campaign)|Better Together]] group which campaigned for a "no" vote in the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum]].<ref name="bbc better together">{{cite news |website=BBC News |date=7 April 2013 |title=Scottish independence: Better Together reveals donor list |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-22058475}}</ref><ref name="Donation to Better Together">{{cite news |website=Newsnet Scotland |date=15 December 2013 |title=Better Together backer linked SNP to "nationalist extremism" |url=http://newsnetscotland.com/index.php/scottish-news/8468-better-together-backer-linked-snp-to-qnationalist-extremismq |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218045531/http://newsnetscotland.com/index.php/scottish-news/8468-better-together-backer-linked-snp-to-qnationalist-extremismq |archive-date=18 December 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> He also said that the Yes Scotland campaign had "dubious" financial backing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scottishreview.net/WalterHumes41.shtml |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-12-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217040953/http://www.scottishreview.net/WalterHumes41.shtml |archive-date=17 December 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

He also strongly opposed [[Brexit]] and wrote that in his view [[British nationalism]] is just as bad as [[Scottish nationalism]].
