==Life==
[[File:Reynolds123.jpg|thumb|left|Lord Carlisle in the ceremonial robes of the [[Order of the Thistle]], by [[Joshua Reynolds]] (1769)]]
He was the son of [[Henry Howard, 4th Earl of Carlisle]] and his second wife [[Isabella Howard, Countess of Carlisle|Isabella Byron]]. His mother was a daughter of [[William Byron, 4th Baron Byron]] and his wife [[Frances Byron, Baroness Byron|Frances Berkeley]], a descendant of [[John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton]]. She was also a sister of [[William Byron, 5th Baron Byron]] and a great-aunt of [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron]], the poet. In 1798, Carlisle was appointed guardian to Lord Byron who later lampooned him in ''[[English Bards and Scotch Reviewers]]''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=340}}

During his youth Carlisle was mentored by [[George Augustus Selwyn (politician)|George Selwyn]] and was chiefly known as a man of pleasure and fashion. He was created a [[Knight of the Thistle]] in 1767, and entered the [[House of Lords]] in 1770. After he had reached thirty years of age, his appointment on a [[Carlisle Peace Commission|Commission]] sent out by [[Frederick North, Lord North]], to attempt a reconciliation with the [[Thirteen Colonies]] during the [[American War of Independence]] was received with sneers by the opposition. The failure of the embassy was not due to any incapacity on the part of the earl, but to the unpopularity of the government from which it received its authority. He was considered to have displayed so much ability that he was entrusted with the viceroyalty of [[Ireland]] in 1780.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=340}}{{sfn|Barker|1891|p=14}}

The time was one of the greatest difficulty; for while the calm of the country was disturbed by the [[American War of Independence]], it was drained of regular troops, and large bands of volunteers not under the control of the government had been formed. Nevertheless, the two years of Carlisle's rule passed in quietness and prosperity, and the institution of a national bank and other measures which he effected left permanently beneficial results upon the commerce of the island. In 1789, in the discussions as to the regency, Carlisle took a prominent part on the side of the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|prince of Wales]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=340}}

In 1791 he opposed [[William Pitt the Younger]]'s policy of resistance to the dismemberment of the [[Ottoman Empire]] by the [[Russian Empire]]; but on the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]] he left the opposition and vigorously maintained the cause of war. He resigned from the [[Order of the Thistle]] and was created a [[Knight of the Garter]] in 1793. In 1815 he opposed the enactment of the [[Corn Laws]]; but from this time till his death, he took no important part in public life.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=340}}{{sfn|Barker|1891|p=16}}

In 1798 he was one of the syndicate who bought the [[Orleans Collection]] of paintings, which were housed in [[Castle Howard]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Family==
On 22 March 1770, Frederick married Lady Margaret Caroline Leveson-Gower (died 27 January 1824), daughter of [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Marquess of Stafford]] and his wife, Lady Louisa Egerton, herself the daughter of [[Scroop Egerton, 1st Duke of Bridgewater]].{{sfn|Barker|1891|p=16}}

They had ten children:
*Lady Isabella Caroline Howard (1771–1848), who married [[John Campbell, 1st Baron Cawdor]], on 27 July 1789 and had issue

*Hon. [[William Howard (1781–1843)|William Howard]] (1781–1843), Member of Parliament
*Lady Gertrude Howard (1783–1870), who married [[William Sloane-Stanley]] on 23 June 1806 and had issue
*Maj. Hon. [[Frederick Howard (British Army officer)|Frederick Howard]] (6 December 1785 – 18 June 1815), [[killed in action]] at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]], who married Frances Susan Lambton and had two sons, including [[Frederick John Howard]]
*Hon. [[Henry Howard (clergyman)|Henry Edward John Howard]] (1795–1868), who married and had issue

The 5th Earl was also reputedly the [[Legitimacy (family law)|natural father]] of [[Howard Staunton]] (1810–1874), an English chess master regarded as having been the world's strongest player from 1843 to 1851, according to information "[[glean]]ed" by chess historian [[H. J. R. Murray]] from various sources, although record of Staunton's birth or baptism has never been found.
