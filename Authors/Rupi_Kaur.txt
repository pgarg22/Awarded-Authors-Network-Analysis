'''Rupi Kaur''' (born 4 October 1992) is an Indian-born Canadian poet, illustrator, photographer, and author. Born in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], India, Kaur immigrated to Canada at a young age with her family. She began performing poetry in 2009 and rose to prominence on [[Instagram]], eventually becoming one of the most popular "[[Instapoetry|Instapoets]]" through her three collections of poetry.

In March 2015, as a part of her university photography project, Kaur posted a series of photographs to Instagram depicting herself with menstrual blood stains on her clothing and bedsheets. Instagram removed the image, in response to which Kaur wrote a viral critique of the company's actions. As a result of the incident, Kaur's poetry gained more traction and her initially self-published debut collection, ''[[Milk and Honey (poetry collection)|Milk and Honey]]'' (2014), was reprinted to widespread commercial success.

The success of ''Milk and Honey'' proved worrisome for Kaur as she struggled throughout the creation of the follow-up, ''[[The Sun and Her Flowers]]'' (2017). Feelings of burnout occurred after the release but soon subsided. A desire to feel less pressure for commercial success influenced her third collection, ''Home Body'' (2020) – a partial response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Considered to be a part of the "Instapoetry" group, Kaur's work is simplistic in nature and explores South Asian identity, immigration and femininity; her childhood and personal life serve as sources of inspiration. Line drawings accompany her poetry with stark subject matters.

Her popularity has been compared to that of a [[popstar]] and Kaur has been praised for influencing the modern literary scene, although Kaur's poetry has had mixed critical reception and been subject to frequent parody; she has been dogged by claims of plagiarism by fellow "Instapoets" and harassment by internet [[Internet troll|trolls]]. Kaur has been included on congratulatory year-end lists by the [[BBC]] and [[Elle (magazine)|''Elle'']]; ''[[The New Republic]]'' controversially called her the "Writer of the Decade".

== Early life ==

Kaur was born into a [[Sikh]] family in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], India, on 5 October 1992.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|last=Fischer|first=Molly|date=3 October 2017|title=The Instagram Poet Outselling Homer Ten to One|url=https://www.thecut.com/2017/10/profile-rupi-kaur-author-of-milk-and-honey.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180605114718/https://www.thecut.com/2017/10/profile-rupi-kaur-author-of-milk-and-honey.html|archive-date=5 June 2018|access-date=14 March 2020|website=The Cut|language=en-us}}</ref><ref name=":9">{{Cite journal|last1=Aguiar|first1=Deborah Vieira Pinto|last2=Magaldi|first2=Carolina Alves|date=30 January 2020|title=Rupi Kaur: Women's Writing Tradition in Translation|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3528322|journal=International Journal of Linguistics, Literature and Translation|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|doi=10.32996/ijllt.2020.3.1.6|doi-broken-date=31 October 2021|ssrn=3528322|access-date=9 June 2021|archive-date=15 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210615095736/https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3528322|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":4">{{Cite web|last=Pike|first=Naomi|date=29 December 2017|title=The Girls Who Ruled 2017|url=https://www.vogue.co.uk/gallery/girls-of-the-year-2017|url-status=live|access-date=8 July 2021|website=[[British Vogue]]|language=en-GB}}</ref> At age three, she immigrated to Canada with her parents to avoid persecution of Sikhs.<ref name=":19">{{Cite web|last=Fishwick|first=Samuel|date=5 May 2017|title=Rupi Kaur: 'I've never been more aware of my colour'|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/culture/rupi-kaur-i-ve-never-been-more-aware-of-my-colour-a3531171.html|url-status=live|access-date=12 June 2021|website=[[Evening Standard]]|language=en|archive-date=29 March 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210329133032/https://www.standard.co.uk/culture/rupi-kaur-i-ve-never-been-more-aware-of-my-colour-a3531171.html}}</ref> Her father had left before, due to hate crimes against Sikh men, and wasn't present for Kaur's birth.<ref name=":44">{{Cite web|last=Rao|first=Sonia|date=11 October 2017|title=Few read poetry, but millions read Rupi Kaur - The Boston Globe|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/books/2017/10/10/few-read-poetry-but-millions-read-rupi-kaur/WhIaCDVOZJHyWfTMX3uojP/story.html|url-status=live|access-date=18 July 2021|website=[[Boston Globe]]|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":49">{{Cite AV media|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/programs/one-plus-one/2017-05-25/one-plus-one:-rupi-kaur/8559760|title=One Plus One: Rupi Kaur|date=May 25, 2017|last=Hutcheon|first=Jane|type=Video|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|series=One Plus One|time=6:00-7:00}}</ref> Due to financial instability, he would send back supplies suitable for Kaur and her upbringing.<ref name=":49" /> She lived with her parents and three younger siblings in a one-bedroom basement flat, where they slept in the same bed.<ref name=":19" /> Her family eventually settled in [[Brampton]], alongside a large South Asian community and Kaur's father, who worked as a truck driver.<ref name=":5" /><ref name=":44" /><ref name=":32" />

they convinced me
i only had a few good years left
before i was replaced by a girl younger than me
as though men yield power with age
but women grow into irrelevance
they can keep their lies
for i have just gotten started
i feel as though i just left the womb
my twenties are the warm-up
for what i'm really about to do
wait till you see me in my thirties
now that will be a proper introduction
to the nasty, wild, woman in me,
how can i leave before the party's started
rehearsals begin at forty
i ripen with age
i do not come with an expiration date
and now
for the main event
curtains up at fifty
let's begin the show</poem>
