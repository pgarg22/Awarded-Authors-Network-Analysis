'''Stella Benson''' (6 January 1892 – 7 December 1933) was an English [[feminist]], novelist, poet, and [[travel writer]]. She was a recipient of the [[Benson Medal]].

==Early life==
Benson was born to Ralph Beaumont Benson (1862–1911), a member of the [[landed gentry]], and Caroline Essex Cholmondeley in [[Easthope]], [[Shropshire]] in 1892. Stella's aunt, [[Mary Cholmondeley]], was a well-known novelist. Stella was often ill during her childhood and throughout her life. By her sixth birthday, she and her family, based in London, had moved frequently. She spent some of her childhood in schools in [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]]. She began writing a diary at the age of 10 and kept it up for all of her life. By the time she was writing poetry, her parents separated; subsequently, she saw her father infrequently. When she did see him, he encouraged her to quit writing poetry for the time being, until she was older and more experienced. Instead, Stella increased her writing output, adding novel-writing to her repertoire. When her father died, Stella learned that he had been an alcoholic.

==Writing==
Benson spent the winter of 1913–14 in the [[West Indies]], which provided material for her first novel, ''I Pose'' (1915). Living in London, she became involved in [[women's suffrage]], as had her older female relatives. During [[World War I]], she supported the troops by gardening and by helping poor women in London's East End at the [[Charity Organisation Society]]. These efforts inspired Benson to write the novels ''This Is the End'' (1917) and
''Living Alone'' (1919). ''Living Alone'' is a [[fantasy]] novel about a woman whose life is transformed by a [[witch]].<ref>[[Brian Stableford]], "[https://sf-encyclopedia.com/fe/benson_stella Benson, Stella]" in ''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'', edited by [[John Clute]] and [[John Grant (author)|John Grant]] (Orbit, 1997), p. 107.</ref> She also published her first volume of poetry, ''Twenty'', in 1918.

Benson then decided that she wanted to see the world, leaving England for the United States in June 1918.<ref name=Dickins1>{{cite book|last=Dickins|first=Gordon|title=An Illustrated Literary Guide to Shropshire|year=1987|publisher=Shropshire Libraries|page=6|isbn=0-903802-37-6}}</ref> After stops in New York, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, and Chicago, where along the way she met various American writers including [[Bertha Damon|Bertha Pope]] and [[Harriet Monroe]], she went to stay with Bertha Pope in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]. In Berkeley and San Francisco from December 1918 through December 1919, she participated in a bohemian community that included [[Albert M. Bender|Albert Bender]], [[Anne Bremer]], [[Witter Bynner]], [[Sara Bard Field]], [[Charles Erskine Scott Wood]], and Marie de Laveaga Welch. She took on a job at the [[University of California]] as a tutor, then as an editorial reader for the university press. Her California experiences inspired her next novel, ''The Poor Man'' (1922).

In 1920, she went to China, where she worked in a mission school and hospital, and met the man who would be her husband, James (Shaemas) O'Gorman Anderson, an [[Anglo-Irish]] officer in the [[Chinese Maritime Customs Service]] (CMCS)<ref name=Dickins1 /> and later father of [[Benedict Anderson]] and [[Perry Anderson]]. They married in London the following year.<ref name=Dickins1 /> This was a complex relationship, but a very firm one. Benson followed Anderson through various Customs postings including [[Nanning]], [[Pakhoi]], and [[Hong Kong]], even though her writings on China sometimes put her at odds with the [[HM Revenue and Customs]] leadership.

They had strong shared intellectual interests. Their honeymoon was spent crossing America in a Ford, and Benson wrote about this in ''The Little World'' (1925).

=== Later works ===
Benson's writings kept coming, although none of her works are well known today. ''Pipers and a Dancer'' (1924) and ''Goodbye, Stranger'' (1926) were followed by another book of travel essays, ''Worlds Within Worlds,'' and the story ''The Man Who Missed the 'Bus'' in 1928. Her most famous work, the novel ''The Far-Away Bride,'' was published in the United States first in 1930 and as ''Tobit Transplanted'' in Britain in 1931. It won the [[Prix Femina|Femina Vie Heureuse Prize]] for English writers in 1932. This was followed by two limited-edition collections of short stories, ''Hope Against Hope'' (1931) of which 670 were printed and signed, and ''Christmas Formula'' (1932).

Benson was a friend of [[Winifred Holtby]] and, through her, of [[Vera Brittain]]. The effects of the news of Benson's death on both women is recalled in Brittain's second volume of autobiography, the first volume of which is the better known ''[[Testament of Youth]]'' (1933).<ref name="Dickins2">{{cite book|last=Dickins|first=Gordon|title=An Illustrated Literary Guide to Shropshire|publisher=Shropshire Libraries|year=1987|isbn=0-903802-37-6|page=8}}</ref>
[[Virginia Woolf]] also knew Benson, and remarked in her diary after her death: 'A curious feeling: when a writer like Stella Benson dies, that one’s response is diminished; Here and Now won’t be lit up by her: its life lessened.' She was also a friend of [[Naomi Mitchison]], who devoted to Benson a chapter in her own autobiography ''You May Well Ask'', with extensive quotations from her correspondence with Benson in the 1920s and early 1930s.<ref>[[Naomi Mitchison]], ''You May Well Ask'', London, 1979, Part II, Chap. 14, "Stella Far Off".</ref>

Benson's last unfinished novel ''Mundos'' and her personal selection of her best poetry ''Poems'' were published posthumously in 1935. Her ''Collected Stories'' were published in 1936.

=== Appraisal ===
According to George Malcolm Johnson, "Stella Benson had a unique ability to blend fantasy and reality, especially evident in her earlier novels and in her short stories. Her impish humour and wicked wit, frequently directed towards a satirical end, masked an underlying compassion. Benson's novels (especially her later more realistic ones) and stories often treat serious social issues and reflect her travails as a twentieth-century woman: supporting female suffrage, witnessing the tragedy of the First World War, and living in a hostile, volatile colonial setting. Despite her very modern, ironic treatment of the theme of individuals lost, isolated, and alienated in strange and frightening situations, she has not garnered much contemporary critical attention, and deserves reappraisal."<ref name=ODNB>{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=G.

== Death ==
She died of [[pneumonia]] on 7 December 1933, at [[Hạ Long]] in the Vietnamese province of [[Tonkin]].<ref name="Dickins2" /><ref>{{Cite news|date=8 December 1933|title=Stella Benson, 41, novelist, is dead|page=23|work=New York Times}}</ref> Immediately after her death, her husband deposited her diaries to the University Library in Cambridge. Almost 50 years later, they were made available and Joy Grant used them to write a biography on her.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Anderson |first1=Perry |title=Perry Anderson · A Belated Encounter: My father's career in the Chinese Customs Service · LRB 30 July 1998 |journal=London Review of Books |date=30 July 1998 |volume=20 |issue=15 |url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v20/n15/perry-anderson/a-belated-encounter?utm_campaign=20200720%20DT91&utm_content=ukrw_nonsubs&utm_medium=email&utm_source=LRB%20themed%20email |accessdate=23 July 2020 |language=en}}</ref>
