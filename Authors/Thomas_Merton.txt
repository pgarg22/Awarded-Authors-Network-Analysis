'''Thomas Merton''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Trappists|OCSO]]}} (January 31, 1915 – December 10, 1968) was an American [[Trappists|Trappist]] monk, writer, theologian, [[Christian mysticism|mystic]], poet, [[social activism|social activist]], and scholar of [[comparative religion]]. On May 26, 1949, he was ordained to the priesthood and given the name "Father Louis".<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Catholic Literature, Volume 2|last=Reichardt|first=Mary R.|year=2004|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=0-313-32803-X|page=450}}</ref><ref>[http://www.merton.org/chrono.htm "Chronology of Merton's life"], Thomas Merton Center, Bellarmine University; accessed April 17, 2018.</ref> He was a member of the [[Abbey of Our Lady of Gethsemani]], near [[Bardstown, Kentucky]], living there from 1941 to his death.

Merton wrote more than 50 books in a period of 27 years,<ref>[[Matthew Fox (priest)|Matthew Fox]], ''A Way to God: Thomas Merton's Creation Spirituality Journey'', New World Library (2016), p. xvi</ref> mostly on [[spirituality]], [[social justice]] and a quiet [[Christian pacifism|pacifism]], as well as scores of [[essay]]s and reviews. Among Merton's most enduring works is his bestselling autobiography ''[[The Seven Storey Mountain]]'' (1948). His account of his spiritual journey inspired scores of World War II veterans, students, and teenagers to explore offerings of monasteries across the US.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=FICTION: 1949 BESTSELLERS: ''Non Fiction'' |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,855108,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220124819/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,855108,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 20, 2010 |date=December 19, 1949 |magazine=[[TIME]] | access-date=May 25, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |title=Religion: The Mountain|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,800091,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220122613/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,800091,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 20, 2010 |magazine=[[TIME]]|date= April 11, 1949 }}</ref> It is on ''[[National Review]]''{{-'}}s list of the 100 best non-fiction books of the century.<ref>[http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/215718/non-fiction-100 National Review's list of the 100 best non-fiction books of the century] [[National Review]] website</ref> 

Merton became a keen proponent of [[interfaith]] understanding, exploring Eastern religions through his study of mystic practice. He is particularly known for having pioneered dialogue with prominent Asian spiritual figures, including the [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]]; Japanese writer [[Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki|D.&nbsp;T. Suzuki]]; Thai Buddhist monk [[Buddhadasa]], and Vietnamese monk [[Thich Nhat Hanh]]. He traveled extensively in the course of meeting with them and attending international conferences on religion. In addition, he wrote books on [[Zen|Zen Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]], and [[Taoism]], and how Christianity related to them. This was highly unusual at the time in the United States, particularly within the religious orders.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Thomas Merton was born in [[Prades, Pyrénées-Orientales]], [[France]], on January 31, 1915, to parents of Welsh origin. [[Owen Merton]], a [[New Zealand]] painter active in [[Europe]] and the [[United States]], and Ruth Jenkins Merton, an American [[Quaker]] and artist. They had met at a painting school in Paris.<ref name=tmc>[http://www.merton.org/chrono.aspx "Thomas Merton's Life and Work", The Thomas Merton Center at Bellarmine University]</ref> He was [[Baptism|baptized]] in the [[Church of England]], in accordance with his father's wishes.<ref name=Jacobs>[https://www.newyorker.com/books/under-review/thomas-merton-the-monk-who-became-a-prophet Jacobs, Alan. "The Modern Monkhood of Thomas Merton", ''The New Yorker'', December 28, 2018]</ref> Merton's father was often absent during his son's childhood. 

During the [[World War I|First World War]], in August 1915, the Merton family left France for the United States. They lived first with Ruth's parents in [[Queens]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and then settled near them in [[Douglaston]]. In 1917, the family moved into an old house in [[Flushing, New York|Flushing]], Queens, where Merton's brother John Paul <!-- his only brother, commas not necessary -->was born on November 2, 1918.<ref>''Seven Storey Mountain'', pp. 7–9.</ref> The family was considering returning to France when Ruth was diagnosed with [[stomach cancer]]. She died from it on October 21, 1921, in [[Bellevue Hospital]]. Merton was six years old and his brother not yet three.<ref>''Seven Storey Mountain'' pp. 15–18.</ref>

In 1926, when Merton was eleven, his father enrolled him in a boys' [[boarding school]] in [[Montauban]], the Lycée Ingres. In the summer of 1928, he withdrew Merton from Lycée Ingres, saying the family was moving to England.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cunningham|first=Lawrence|title=Thomas Merton and the Monastic Vision|year=1999|publisher=Wm.

==College==
In October 1933, Merton, now 18, entered [[Clare College]] as an undergraduate to study Modern Languages (French and Italian).<ref name=tmc/> 

In January 1935, Merton, age 21, enrolled as a sophomore at [[Columbia University]] in [[Manhattan]]. There he established close and long-lasting friendships with [[Ad Reinhardt]], who became known as a proto-[[minimalist]] painter,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Yau|first=John|date=2014-01-16|title=Ad Reinhardt and the Via Negativa|url=https://brooklynrail.org/special/AD_REINHARDT/ad-and-spirituality/ad-reinhardt-and-the-via-negativa|access-date=2021-08-29|website=The Brooklyn Rail|language=en-US}}</ref> poet [[Robert Lax]],<ref>{{Cite book|last=Biddle|first=Arthur W.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DGO8mse-lOIC&q=john+slate+robert+lax&pg=PR8|title=When Prophecy Still Had a Voice: The Letters of Thomas Merton and Robert Lax|date=2001-01-01|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=978-0-8131-2168-0|language=en}}</ref> commentator [[Ralph de Toledano]],<ref>{{Cite web|last=Ziolkowski|first=Jan M.|date=2018|title=The Juggler of Notre Dame and the Medievalizing of Modernity.

Merton began an 18th-century English literature course during the spring semester taught by [[Mark Van Doren]], a professor with whom he maintained a lifetime friendship.  

[[File:CorpusChristiExt2.jpg|thumb|left|Corpus Christi Church, W. 121st St.]]
In January 1938, Merton graduated from Columbia with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in English. In June, his friend Seymour Freedgood arranged a meeting with [[Mahanambrata Brahmachari]], a [[Hindu]] monk visiting New York from the [[University of Chicago]]. Merton was impressed by him, believing the monk was profoundly centered in God. While Merton expected Brahmachari to recommend Hinduism, instead he advised Merton to reconnect with the spiritual roots of his own culture. He suggested Merton read ''The [[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'' of [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] and ''[[The Imitation of Christ]]''. Merton read them both.<ref>{{cite news |title=Mahanambrata Brahmachari Is Dead at 95|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/01/world/mahanambrata-brahmachari-is-dead-at-95.html?sec=&spon= |date=November 1, 1999 |newspaper=New York Times | first=Gustav | last=Niebuhr | access-date=May 25, 2010}}</ref>

Merton decided to explore Catholicism further. Finally, in August 1938, he decided to attend Mass and went to [[Corpus Christi Church (New York)|Corpus Christi Church]], located near the Columbia campus on West 121st Street in [[Morningside Heights]]. The ritual of Mass was foreign to him, but he listened attentively. Following this, Merton began to read more extensively in [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]]. 

On November 16, 1938, Thomas Merton underwent the rite of baptism at Corpus Christi Church and received [[Holy Communion]].<ref>''Thomas Merton's paradise journey: writings on contemplation,'' by William Henry Shannon, Thomas Merton, Continuum International Publishing Group, 2000 p. 278.</ref> On February 22, 1939, Merton received his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in English from Columbia University. Merton decided he would pursue his [[Ph.D.]] at Columbia and moved from Douglaston to [[Greenwich Village]].

==Monastic life==
[[File:Thomas Merton hermitage (Abbey of Gethsemani).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Thomas Merton's hermitage at The Abbey of Our Lady of Gethsemani]]
On December 10, 1941, Thomas Merton arrived at the [[Abbey of Gethsemani]] and spent three days at the monastery guest house, waiting for acceptance into the Order. The novice master would come to interview Merton, gauging his sincerity and qualifications. In the interim, Merton was put to work polishing floors and scrubbing dishes. On December 13 he was accepted into the monastery as a postulant by Frederic Dunne, Gethsemani's abbot since 1935. Merton's first few days did not go smoothly. He had a severe cold from his stay in the guest house, where he sat in front of an open window to prove his sincerity. During his initial weeks at Gethsemani, Merton studied the complicated [[Monastic sign language|Cistercian sign language]] and daily work and worship routine.

In March 1942, during the first Sunday of [[Lent]], Merton was accepted as a novice at the monastery. In June, he received a letter from his brother John Paul stating he was soon to leave for the war and would be coming to Gethsemani to visit before leaving. On July 17 John Paul arrived in Gethsemani and the two brothers did some catching up. John Paul expressed his desire to become Catholic, and by July 26 was baptized at a church in nearby [[New Haven, Kentucky]], leaving the following day. This would be the last time the two saw each other. John Paul died on April 17, 1943, when his plane failed over the [[English Channel]]. A poem by Merton to John Paul appears in ''The Seven Storey Mountain''.

===Writer===
Merton kept journals throughout his stay at Gethsemani. Initially, he felt writing to be at odds with his vocation, worried it would foster a tendency to individuality. Fortunately his superior, Dunne, saw that Merton had both a gifted intellect and talent for writing. In 1943 Merton was tasked to translate religious texts and write biographies on the saints for the monastery. Merton approached his new writing assignment with the same fervor and zeal he displayed in the farmyard.

On March 19, 1944, Merton made his temporary profession of [[vows]] and was given the white [[cowl]], black [[scapular]] and leather belt. In November 1944 a manuscript Merton had given to friend [[Robert Lax]] the previous year was published by [[James Laughlin]] at [[New Directions Publishing|New Directions]]: a book of [[poetry]] titled ''Thirty Poems''. Merton had mixed feelings about the publishing of this work, but Dunne remained resolute over Merton continuing his writing. In 1946 New Directions published another poetry collection by Merton, ''A Man in the Divided Sea'', which, combined with ''Thirty Poems'', attracted some recognition for him. The same year Merton's manuscript for ''The Seven Storey Mountain'' was accepted by [[Harcourt Trade Publishers|Harcourt Brace & Company]] for publication. ''The Seven Storey Mountain'', Merton's [[autobiography]], was written during two-hour intervals in the monastery [[scriptorium]] as a personal project.

By 1947 Merton was more comfortable in his role as a writer. On March 19 he took his solemn vows, a commitment to live out his life at the monastery. He also began corresponding with a [[Carthusian]] at [[St. Hugh's Charterhouse, Parkminster|St. Hugh's Charterhouse]] in England. Merton had harbored an appreciation for the Carthusian Order since coming to Gethsemani in 1941, and would later come to consider leaving the Cistercians for that Order. On July 4 the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] journal ''[[Commonweal (magazine)|Commonweal]]'' published an essay by Merton titled ''Poetry and the Contemplative Life''.

In 1948 ''The Seven Storey Mountain'' was published to critical acclaim, with fan mail to Merton reaching new heights. Merton also published several works for the monastery that year, which were: ''Guide to Cistercian Life'', ''Cistercian Contemplatives'', ''Figures for an Apocalypse'', and ''The Spirit of Simplicity''. That year [[Saint Mary's College (Indiana)]] also published a booklet by Merton, ''What Is Contemplation?'' Merton published as well that year a biography, ''Exile Ends in Glory: The Life of a Trappistine, Mother M. Berchmans, O.C.S.O''. Merton's abbot, Dunne, died on August 3, 1948, while riding on a train to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Dunne's passing was painful for Merton, who had come to look on the abbot as a father figure and spiritual mentor. On August 15 the monastic community elected Dom James Fox, a former [[US Navy]] officer, as their new abbot. In October Merton discussed with him his ongoing attraction to the Carthusian and [[Camaldolese]] Orders and their [[hermit|eremitical]] way of life, to which Fox responded by assuring Merton that he belonged at Gethsemani. Fox permitted Merton to continue his writing, Merton now having gained substantial recognition outside the monastery. On December 21 Merton was ordained as a [[subdeacon]]. From 1948 on, Merton identified as an anarchist.<ref name="Labrie 2001 p. 207">{{cite book | last=Labrie | first=R. | title=Thomas Merton and the Inclusive Imagination | publisher=University of Missouri Press | year=2001 | isbn=978-0-8262-6279-0 | url=https://archive.org/details/thomasmertonincl00labr | url-access=registration | access-date=7 May 2017 | page=[https://archive.org/details/thomasmertonincl00labr/page/207 207]}}</ref>

On January 5, 1949, Merton took a train to [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] and applied for American citizenship. Published that year were ''Seeds of Contemplation'', ''The Tears of Blind Lions'', ''The Waters of Siloe'', and the British edition of ''The Seven Storey Mountain'' under the title ''Elected Silence''. On March 19, Merton became a deacon in the Order, and on May 26 ([[Ascension Thursday]]) he was ordained a priest, saying his first Mass the following day. In June, the monastery celebrated its [[centenary]], for which Merton authored the book ''Gethsemani Magnificat'' in commemoration. In November, Merton started teaching [[mystical theology]] to novices at Gethsemani, a duty he greatly enjoyed. By this time Merton was a huge success outside the monastery, ''The Seven Storey Mountain'' having sold over 150,000 copies. In subsequent years Merton would author many other books, amassing a wide readership. He would revise ''Seeds of Contemplation'' several times, viewing his early edition as error-prone and immature. A person's place in society, views on social activism, and various approaches toward contemplative prayer and living became constant themes in his writings.

In this particularly prolific period of his life, Merton is believed to have been suffering from a great deal of [[loneliness]] and [[Psychological stress|stress]]. One incident indicative of this is the drive he took in the monastery's jeep, during which Merton, acting in a possibly [[mania|manic]] state, erratically slid around the road and almost caused a head-on collision.<ref>Waldron, Robert G. (2014). ''The Wounded Heart of Thomas Merton''. [[Paulist Press]]. p. 56. {{ISBN|978-0809146840}}.</ref>

During long years at Gethsemani, Merton changed from the passionately inward-looking young monk of ''The Seven Storey Mountain'' to a more contemplative writer and poet. Merton became well known for his dialogues with other faiths and his non-violent stand during the [[race riot]]s and [[Vietnam War]] of the 1960s.

By the 1960s, he had arrived at a broadly human viewpoint, one deeply concerned about the world and issues like peace, racial tolerance, and social equality. He had developed a personal radicalism which had political implications but was not based on ideology, rooted above all in non-violence. He regarded his viewpoint as based on "simplicity" and expressed it as a Christian sensibility. His ''New Seeds of Contemplation'' was published in 1962. In a letter to Nicaraguan Catholic priest, liberation theologian and politician [[Ernesto Cardenal]] (who entered Gethsemani but left in 1959 to study theology in Mexico), Merton wrote: "The world is full of great criminals with enormous power, and they are in a death struggle with each other. It is a huge gang battle, using well-meaning lawyers and policemen and clergymen as their front, controlling papers, means of communication, and enrolling everybody in their armies."<ref>Letter, November 17, 1962, quoted in [[Monica Furlong]]'s ''Merton: a Biography'' p. 263.</ref>

Merton finally achieved the solitude he had long desired while living in a [[Hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitage]] on the monastery grounds in 1965. Over the years he had occasional battles with some of his [[abbot]]s about not being allowed out of the monastery despite his international reputation and voluminous correspondence with many well-known figures of the day.

At the end of 1968, the new abbot, Flavian Burns, allowed him the freedom to undertake a tour of Asia, during which he met the [[Tenzin Gyatso|Dalai Lama]] in India on three occasions, and also the [[Tibetan Buddhist]] [[Dzogchen]] master [[Chatral Rinpoche]], followed by a solitary retreat near [[Darjeeling]], India. In Darjeeling, he befriended [[Tsewang Yishey Pemba]], a prominent member of the Tibetan community.<ref>{{cite news |title=A Man of Many Firsts |url=http://www.kuenselonline.com/2011/?p=22726 |date=December 11, 2011 |publisher=[[Kuensel|KUENSEL]] |access-date=December 12, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Merton |first= Thomas |title= The Asian Journal of Thomas Merton |publisher= [[New Directions Publishing|New Directions]] |date= February 1975 |isbn= 0-8112-0570-3 |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/isbn_0811205703 }}</ref> Then, in what was to be his final letter, he noted, "In my contacts with these new friends, I also feel a consolation in my own faith in Christ and in his dwelling presence.

==Personal life ==
[[File:Thomas Merton (Abbey of Gethsemani Gravesite).jpg|thumb|right|The grave of Thomas Merton. His grave marker reads "Fr. Louis Merton, Died Dec. 10, 1968."]]
According to ''The Seven Storey Mountain'', the youthful Merton loved [[jazz]], but by the time he began his first teaching job he had forsaken all but peaceful music. Later in life, whenever he was permitted to leave Gethsemani for medical or monastic reasons, he would catch what live jazz he could, mainly in Louisville or New York.

In April 1966, Merton underwent surgery to treat debilitating back pain. While recuperating in a Louisville hospital, he fell in love with Margie Smith,<ref name=mr>{{cite news |title=Book on monk Thomas Merton's love affair stirs debate |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/religion/2009-12-23-Merton23_st_N.htm |date= December 23, 2009 |newspaper=[[USA Today]]| access-date=December 16, 2012}}</ref> a student nurse assigned to his care. (He referred to her in his diary as "M.") He wrote poems to her and reflected on the relationship in "A Midsummer Diary for M." Merton struggled to maintain his vows while being deeply in love. It is not known if he ever consummated the relationship.<ref group="note">This issue is discussed in detail in {{cite book |title=Beneath The Mask of Holiness|last=Shaw |first=Mark |year=2009 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-0-230-61653-0 }} 

In ''Learning to Love'', Merton's diary entries discuss his various meetings with Smith. In several cases he expressly denies sexual consummation, e.g. p. 52. On June 11, 1966, Merton arranged to 'borrow' the Louisville office of his psychologist, Dr. James Wygal, to get together with Smith, see p. 81. The diary entry for that day notes that they had a bottle of champagne. A parenthetical with dots at that point in the narrative indicates that further details regarding this meeting were not published in ''Learning to Love.'' In the June 14 entry, Merton notes that he had found out the night before that a brother at the abbey had overheard one of his phone conversations with Smith and had reported it to Dom James, Abbot of Gethsemani. Merton wondered which phone conversation had been monitored, saying that one he had the morning following his meeting with Smith at Wygal's office would be "the worst!!", see p. 82. Merton's June 14 entry note his discussions with Abbot James on this matter, and his intent to follow the Abbot's instruction to end his romantic relationship with M. In his entry for July 12, 1966, Merton says regarding Smith, 
<blockquote>"Yet there is no question I love her deeply&nbsp;... I keep remembering her body, her nakedness, the day at Wygal's, and it haunts me&nbsp;... I could have been enslaved to the need for her body after all. It is a good thing I called it off [i.e., a proposed visit by Smith to Gethsemani to speak with Merton there following their break-up]." See p. 94.</blockquote>

In ''Learning to Love'' reveals that Merton remained in contact with Marge after his July 12, 1966 entry (p.94) and after he recommitted himself to his vows (p. 110). He saw her again on July 16, 1966, and wrote: 
<blockquote>She says she thinks of me all the time (as I do of her) and her only fear is that being apart and not having news of each other, we may gradually cease to believe that we are loved, that the other's love for us goes on and is real. As I kissed her she kept saying, 'I am happy, I am at peace now.' And so was I" (p. 97).</blockquote> Despite good intentions, he continued to contact her by phone when he left the monastery grounds. He wrote on January 18, 1967 that "last week" he and two friends "drank some beer under the loblollies at the lake--should not have gone to Bardstown and Willett's in the evening. Conscience stricken for this the next day. Called M. from filling station outside Bardstown. Both glad" (p. 186).</ref>

==Death==
On December 10, 1968, Merton was at a [[Red Cross]] retreat center named Sawang Kaniwat in [[Samut Prakan]], a province near [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]], attending a monastic conference.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A New Charter For Monasticism|last=Moffitt|first=John|publisher=Notre Dame Press|year=1970|pages=332–335}}</ref> After giving a talk at the morning session, he was found dead later in the afternoon in the room of his cottage, wearing only shorts, lying on his back with a short-circuited Hitachi floor fan lying across his body.<ref name=":0">Hugh Turley and David Martin, ''The Martyrdom of Thomas Merton: An Investigation'',  [http://merton.org/book.aspx]</ref> His associate, Jean Leclercq, states: "In all probability the death of Thomas Merton was due in part to heart failure, in part to an electric shock."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://monasticdialog.com/a.php?id=873 |title=Monastic Interreligious Dialogue - Final Memories of Thomas Merton |date=December 12, 2008 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212155450/http://monasticdialog.com/a.php?id=873 |archive-date=December 12, 2008 }}</ref> Since there was no [[autopsy]], there was no suitable explanation for the wound in the back of Merton's head, "which had bled considerably."<ref>Michael Mott, ''The Seven Mountains of Thomas Merton'', pp. 567–568.

Merton was first exposed to and became interested in [[Eastern religions]] when he read [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Ends and Means]]'' in 1937, the year before his conversion to [[Catholicism]].<ref>''Solitary Explorer: Thomas Merton's Transforming Journey'' p.100.</ref> Throughout his life, he studied [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Sufism]] in addition to his academic and monastic studies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lighthousetrailsresearch.com/merton.htm|title=Lighthouse Trails Research Project - Exposing the New Spirituality}}</ref>

While Merton was not interested in what these traditions had to offer as doctrines and institutions, he was deeply interested in what each said of the depth of human experience. He believed that for the most part, Christianity had forsaken its mystical tradition in favor of [[Cartesian dualism|Cartesian]] emphasis on "the reification of concepts, idolization of the reflexive consciousness, flight from being into verbalism, mathematics, and rationalization."<ref>''Conjectures of a Guilty Bystander'' p. 285.</ref> Eastern traditions, for Merton, were mostly untainted by this type of thinking and thus had much to offer in terms of how to think of and understand oneself.

Merton was perhaps most interested in—and, of all of the Eastern traditions, wrote the most about—[[Zen]]. Having studied the [[Desert Fathers]] and other Christian mystics as part of his monastic vocation, Merton had a deep understanding of what it was those men sought and experienced in their seeking. He found many parallels between the language of these Christian mystics and the language of Zen philosophy.<ref name="Solitary Explorer p.105"/>

In 1959, Merton began a dialogue with [[D.&nbsp;T. Suzuki]] which was published in Merton's ''Zen and the Birds of Appetite'' as "Wisdom in Emptiness". This dialogue began with the completion of Merton's ''The Wisdom of the Desert''. Merton sent a copy to Suzuki with the hope that he would comment on Merton's view that the Desert Fathers and the early Zen masters had similar experiences. Nearly ten years later, when ''Zen and the Birds of Appetite'' was published, Merton wrote in his postface that "any attempt to handle Zen in theological language is bound to miss the point", calling his final statements "an example of how not to approach Zen."<ref>''Zen and the Birds of Appetite'' p. 139.</ref> Merton struggled to reconcile the Western and Christian impulse to catalog and put into words every experience with the ideas of Christian [[apophatic theology]] and the unspeakable nature of the Zen experience.

In keeping with his idea that non-Christian faiths had much to offer Christianity in experience and perspective and little or nothing in terms of doctrine, Merton distinguished between Zen Buddhism, an expression of history and culture, and Zen.<ref name="Solitary Explorer p.105">''Solitary Explorer: Thomas Merton's Transforming Journey'' p. 105.</ref> What Merton meant by Zen Buddhism was the religion that began in China and spread to Japan as well as the rituals and institutions that accompanied it. By Zen, Merton meant something not bound by culture, religion or belief. In this capacity, Merton was influenced by Aelred Graham's book ''Zen Catholicism'' of 1963.<ref>''Solitary Explorer: Thomas Merton's Transforming Journey'' p. 106.</ref><ref group="note">"Can a philosophy of life which originated in India centuries before Christ—still accepted as valid, in one or other of its many variants, by several hundred millions of our contemporaries—be of service to Catholics, or those interested in Catholicism, in elucidating certain aspects of the Church's own message? The possibility cannot be ruled out. To the point is [[St. Ambrose|St.{{space|thin}}Ambrose]]'s well-known dictum, endorsed by [[St. Thomas Aquinas|St.{{space|thin}}Thomas Aquinas]], being a gloss on {{bibleverse-lb|1|Corinthians|12:3|KJV}}, 'All that is true, ''by whomsoever it has been said'', is from the Holy Ghost.{{' "}} {{cite book |last=Graham |first=Aelred |title=Zen Catholicism |url={{google books|nnzXAAAAMAAJ|plainurl=yes}} |date=1963 |location=San Diego, CA |publisher=Harcourt, Brace & World |series=Harvest book |volume=118 |page=10}}</ref> With this idea in mind, Merton's later writings about Zen may be understood to be coming more and more from within an evolving and broadening tradition of Zen which is not particularly Buddhist but informed by Merton's monastic training within the Christian tradition.<ref>''Solitary Explorer: Thomas Merton's Transforming Journey'' p. 112.</ref>

===American Indian spirituality===
Merton also explored [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] spirituality. He wrote a series of articles on American Indian history and spirituality for ''The Catholic Worker'', ''The Center Magazine'', ''Theoria to Theory'', and ''Unicorn Journal''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Merton|first=Thomas|title=Ishi Means Man|year=1976|publisher=Unicorn Press|url= http://merton.org/Research/Manuscripts/manu.aspx?id=3921}}</ref> He explored themes such as American Indian [[fasting]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Merton|first=Thomas|title=Ishi Means Man|year=1976|publisher=Unicorn Press|page=17|url= http://merton.org/Research/Manuscripts/manu.aspx?id=3921}}</ref> and [[missionary]] work.<ref>{{cite book|last=Merton|first=Thomas|title=Ishi Means Man|year=1976|publisher=Unicorn Press|page=37|url= http://merton.org/Research/Manuscripts/manu.aspx?id=3921}}</ref>

==Legacy==
[[File:Thomas merton sign.jpg|thumbnail|Marker commemorating Thomas Merton in Louisville, Kentucky]]
Merton's influence has grown since his death and he is widely recognized as an important 20th-century Catholic [[mysticism|mystic]] and thinker. Interest in his work contributed to a rise in spiritual exploration beginning in the 1960s and 1970s in the United States. Merton's letters and diaries reveal the intensity with which their author focused on social justice issues, including the civil rights movement and [[Proliferation of nuclear weapons|proliferation of nuclear arms]].<ref>{{cite journal |last= Farrell| first=James J.|title= Thomas Merton and the Religion of the Bomb|url= https://www.jstor.org/stable/1123966 |journal= Religion and American Culture|publisher= University of California Press| date= 1995| volume=5| number = 1| pages = 77–98| doi=10.2307/1123966| jstor=1123966}}</ref> He had prohibited their publication for 25 years after his death.

An annual lecture in his name is given at his alma mater, [[Columbia University]] in which the Columbia chaplaincy invites a prominent Catholic to speak.<ref>{{Cite web|title= Columbia250 Celebrates Colmbians Ahead of Their Time|url= https://c250.columbia.edu/c250_celebrates/remarkable_columbians/thomas_merton.html|access-date=2021-07-06|website=Columbia University|language=en}}</ref>

The campus ministry building at [[St. Bonaventure University]], the school where Merton taught English briefly between graduating from Columbia University with his M.A. in English and entering the Trappist Order, is named after him. St. Bonaventure University also holds an important repository of Merton materials worldwide.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20130511215042/http://web.sbu.edu/friedsam/archives/mertonweb/index.html {{Bare URL inline|date=November 2021}}</ref>

Some of Merton's manuscripts that include correspondence with his superiors are located in the library of the Monastery of the Holy Spirit in [[Conyers, Georgia]]. [[Antony Theodore]] has provided details of his encounters with Asian spiritual leaders and the influence of [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], [[Zen Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]] on Merton's mysticism and philosophy of contemplation.<ref>{{cite book| first =Antony| last=Theodore| url= https://www.worldcat.org/title/thomas-mertons-mystical-quest-for-the-union-with-god/oclc/30320691 | date= January 1, 1993 | access-date = July 6, 2021 | title = Thomas Merton's Mystical Quest for Union with God | pages= 88–92 | oclc=30320691}}</ref>

Merton was one of four Americans mentioned by [[Pope Francis]] in his speech to a joint meeting of the [[United States Congress]] on September 24, 2015. Francis said, "Merton was above all a man of prayer, a thinker who challenged the certitudes of his time and opened new horizons for souls and for the Church. He was also a man of dialogue, a promoter of peace between peoples and religions."<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/speeches/2015/september/documents/papa-francesco_20150924_usa-us-congress.html | date= September 24, 2015 | access-date = September 24, 2015| title = Address of the Holy Father | website= The Vatican }}</ref>

==In popular culture==
Merton's life was the subject of ''The Glory of the World'', a play by [[Charles L. Mee]]. Roy Cockrum, a former monk who won the Powerball lottery in 2014, helped finance the production of the play in New York. Prior to New York the play was being shown in Louisville, Kentucky.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/2016/01/16/463081186/glory-of-the-world-is-more-wacky-birthday-party-than-traditional-play | title='Glory Of The World' Is More Wacky Birthday Party Than Traditional Play | publisher=[[NPR]].org | date=January 16, 2016 | author=Lunden, Jeff}}</ref>

In the movie ''[[First Reformed]]'', written and directed by [[Paul Schrader]], [[Ethan Hawke]]'s character (a middle-aged [[Protestantism in the United States|Protestant]] reverend) is influenced by Merton's work.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/first-reformed-paul-schrader-ethan-hawke/Content?oid=48718475|title=Paul Schrader's First Reformed finds pride at the root of despair|last=Jones|first=J.R.|work=Chicago Reader|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en}}</ref>
