'''Sara Brita Stridsberg''' (born 29 August 1972 in [[Solna Municipality|Solna]], [[Stockholm County]]) is a Swedish [[author]] and playwright. Her first novel, ''Happy Sally'' was about [[Sally Bauer]], who in 1939 had become the first Scandinavian woman to swim the [[English Channel]].

Her big international breakthrough came with the publication of The Faculty of Dreams/Valerie in 2006. The novel received the Nordic Council Award in 2007, and was nominated to the Man Booker award when published 2019 in the UK and US. Her novels are today translated into 25 languages.

In 2007, she was awarded [[the Nordic Council's Literature Prize]] for her novel ''[[Drömfakulteten]]'' (''Valerie, or The Faculty of Dreams''),<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gp.se/kulturnoje/1.2474154-sara-stridsberg-ger-sig-han-at-vansinnesrytmen |title=Sara Stridsberg ger sig hän åt vansinnesrytmen |language=sv |trans-title=Sara Stridsberg surrenders to the rhythm of insanity |newspaper=[[Göteborgs-Posten]] |date=30 August 2014}}</ref> which is her second novel and a fictitious story about [[Valerie Solanas]], who wrote the ''[[SCUM manifesto]]'', which Stridsberg has translated into Swedish.
