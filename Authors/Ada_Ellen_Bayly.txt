'''Ada Ellen Bayly''' (25 March 1857 – 8 February 1903), also known as '''Edna Lyall''', was an English [[novelist]], who "supported the women's suffrage movement from an early age."<ref name="Jarndyce">''XIX Century Fiction, Part II: L–Z'', London: Jarndyce, 2020, Item 34.</ref><ref>G. Lindop, ''A Literary Guide to the Lake District'' (1993) p. 311.</ref>

==Biography==
Bayly was born in Brighton, the youngest of four children of a barrister. Early in life she lost both her parents, so that she spent her youth with an uncle in [[Surrey]] and in a [[Brighton]] private school. Bayly never married. She seems to have spent her adult life living with her two married sisters and her brother, a clergyman in [[Bosbury]], [[Herefordshire]].

In 1879, she published her first novel, ''Won by Waiting'', under the pseudonym "Edna Lyall" (apparently derived from transposing letters from Ada Ellen Bayly). The book was not a success. Success came with ''We Two'', based on the life of [[Charles Bradlaugh]], a social reformer and advocate of free thought. Her historical novel ''In the Golden Days'' was the last book read to [[John Ruskin]] on his deathbed;<ref>Drabble, Margaret (ed.) (1995), The Oxford Companion to English Literature (5th rev. ed.), Oxford, England: Oxford University Press.</ref> while ''Hope the Hermit'' was a bestseller set in the [[Lake District]] and later an inspiration for [[Hugh Walpole]]'s ''Rogue Herries''.<ref>G. Lindop, ''A Literary Guide to the Lake District'' (1993) p. 311.</ref> ''To Right the Wrong'' (2nd ed. 1894) is a historical novel about [[John Hampden]] and the [[English Civil War]].<ref name="Jarndyce"/>

Bayly wrote in all eighteen novels, many of them offering interesting explorations of the writer's creative process.<ref>Darby Lewes, ''Auto-poetica'' (2006) p. 67</ref> Part of her success was due to her practice of using characters from one novel in a different capacity in her next.<ref>S. Mitchell, ''Victorian Britain'' (2012) p. 468</ref>
