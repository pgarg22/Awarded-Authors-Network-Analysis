:*2006 [[Jerome Hill]] Travel and Study grant to [[Ghana]], [[West Africa]], in order to study the experiences of [[slaves]] in the [[African slave trade]] and [[Atlantic slave trade]] routes.  Two works will be created: The first is the [[kinesthetic]] based ''EGRESS'', an [[abstraction]] of the [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] play ''[[No Exit]]'',  which explores the subconscious of contemporary culture and relationships, refracting an expansive notion of “[[African American culture|blackness]]”. The second work, ''Childr’n of O'', examines the voice and image of an [[Cultural icon|iconic]] [[Black women|Black woman]] figure. The project uses seven characters, utilizing [[poetic]] text, the [[deconstruction]] of television and Internet cultural symbolism, and the use of [[gesture]] language and [[multimedia]] projections.
