'''Dennis Lester McKiernan''' (born April 4, 1932) is an American writer best known for his [[high fantasy]] ''[[The Iron Tower]]''. His genres include [[high fantasy]] (set in various fictitious worlds), science fiction, [[horror fiction]], and [[crime fiction]]. His primary setting, Mithgar, was originally meant to host Middle-Earth stories that were sequels to Tolkien's work.  It has since grown to reflect a much broader variety of influences, including "fairy tales and Oz books and folk tales and other such stories".<ref>{{cite web |last1=McKiernan |first1=Dennis |title=FAQ |url=https://www.mithgar.com/faq.htm |website=Mithgar.com |accessdate=June 3, 2020}}</ref>

== Biography ==
McKiernan was born in [[Moberly, Missouri]], where he lived until he served the [[U.S. Air Force]] for four years, stationed within US territory during the [[Korean War]].  After military service, he attended the [[University of Missouri]] and received a [[Bachelor of Science|BS]] in [[electrical engineering]] in 1958 and an [[Master of Science|MS]] in the same field from [[Duke University]] in 1964.  He worked as an engineer at [[American Telephone & Telegraph|AT&T]], initially at [[Western Electric]] but soon at [[Bell Laboratories]], from 1958 until 1989.  In 1989, after early retirement from engineering, McKiernan began writing on a full-time basis.

In 1977, while riding his motorcycle, McKiernan was hit by a car that had crossed the center-line, and he was confined to a bed, first in traction and then in a [[hip spica cast]], for many months.  During his recuperation, he began a sequel to [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.  The publisher [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] showed an interest in his work and tried to obtain authorization from Tolkien's estate but was denied.  Doubleday then asked McKiernan to rewrite his story, placing the characters in a different fictitious world, and also to write a prequel supporting it.  The prequel, of necessity, resembles ''The Lord of the Rings''; the decision of Doubleday to issue the work as a trilogy increased that resemblance; and some critics have seen McKiernan as simply imitating Tolkien's epic work.  McKiernan has subsequently developed stories in the series that followed along a story line different from those that plausibly could have been taken by Tolkien.

McKiernan's Faery Series expands tales drawn from [[Andrew Lang's Fairy Books]], additionally tying the selected tales together with a larger plot.

McKiernan currently lives in [[Tucson, Arizona]].
