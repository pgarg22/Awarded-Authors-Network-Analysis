'''Max Ernst''' (2 April 1891 – 1 April 1976) was a German (naturalised American in 1948 and French in 1958) painter, sculptor, [[graphic artist]], and poet.<ref>https://www.kasmingallery.com/artist/max-ernst</ref> A prolific artist, Ernst was a primary pioneer of the [[Dada]] movement and [[surrealism]].<ref>https://www.kasmingallery.com/artist/max-ernst</ref> He had no formal artistic training, but his experimental attitude toward the making of art resulted in his invention of [[frottage (surrealist technique)|frottage]]—a technique that uses pencil rubbings of objects as a source of images—and [[Grattage (art)|grattage]], an analogous technique in which paint is scraped across canvas to reveal the imprints of the objects placed beneath. He is also noted for his novels consisting of [[collage]]s. 

==Biography==

===Early life===
Max Ernst was born in [[Brühl, North Rhine-Westphalia|Brühl]], near [[Cologne]], the third of nine children of a middle-class [[Catholic]] family. His father Philipp was a teacher of the deaf and an amateur painter, a devout Christian and a strict disciplinarian. He inspired in Max a penchant for defying authority, while his interest in painting and sketching in nature influenced Max to take up painting.<ref name="chrono285">Spies, Rewald 2005, 285–286.</ref> In 1909, Ernst enrolled in the [[University of Bonn]] to read philosophy, art history, literature, psychology and psychiatry.<ref>https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/artist/max-ernst</ref> He visited [[lunatic asylum|asylums]] and became fascinated with the art work of the mentally ill patients; he also started painting that year, producing sketches in the garden of the Brühl castle, and portraits of his sister and himself. In 1911, Ernst befriended [[August Macke]] and joined his ''Die Rheinischen Expressionisten'' group of artists, deciding to become an artist.<ref>https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/artist/max-ernst</ref>

In 1912, he visited the Sonderbund exhibition in Cologne, where works by [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[post-Impressionist]]s such as [[Vincent van Gogh]] and [[Paul Gauguin]] profoundly influenced him. His work was exhibited that year together with that of the Das Junge Rheinland group, at Galerie Feldman in Cologne, and then in several group exhibitions in 1913.<ref name="chrono285" /> In his paintings of this period, Ernst adopted an ironic style that juxtaposed grotesque elements alongside [[Cubism|Cubist]] and [[German Expressionism|Expressionist]] motifs.<ref>Spies et al. 1991, p. 56.</ref>

In 1914, Ernst met [[Hans Arp]] in Cologne. The two became friends and their relationship lasted for fifty years. After Ernst completed his studies in the summer, his life was interrupted by [[World War I]]. Ernst was drafted and served both on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western]] and the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Fronts]]. The effect of the war on Ernst was devastating; in his autobiography, he wrote of his time in the army thus: "On the first of August 1914 M[ax].E[rnst]. died. He was resurrected on the eleventh of November 1918".<ref>Spies, Rewald 2005, xiv.</ref> For a brief period on the Western Front, Ernst was assigned to chart maps, which allowed him to continue painting.<ref name="chrono285"/> Several [[German Expressionist]] painters died in action during the war, among them [[August Macke]] and [[Franz Marc]].

===Dada and surrealism===
[[File:Ubu Imperator.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Max Ernst, ''[[Ubu Roi|Ubu Imperator]]'', 1923, [[Musée National d'Art Moderne]], [[Centre Pompidou]], Paris]]
In 1918, Ernst was demobilised and returned to Cologne. He soon married art history student Luise Straus, whom he had met in 1914. In 1919, Ernst visited [[Paul Klee]] in Munich and studied paintings by [[Giorgio de Chirico]]. The same year, inspired by de Chirico and mail-order catalogues, teaching-aide manuals and similar sources, he produced his first [[collage]]s (notably ''Fiat modes'', a portfolio of [[lithograph]]s), a technique which would dominate his artistic pursuits. Also in 1919, Ernst, social activist [[Johannes Theodor Baargeld]] and several colleagues founded the Cologne [[Dada]] group. In 1919–20, Ernst and Baargeld published various short-lived magazines such as ''Der Strom'', ''die Schammade'' and organised Dada exhibitions.<ref name="chrono285"/>

Ernst and Luise's son [[Jimmy Ernst|Ulrich 'Jimmy' Ernst]] was born on 24 June 1920; he also became a painter.<ref name="chrono285" /> Ernst's marriage to Luise was short-lived. In 1921, he met [[Paul Éluard]], who became a lifelong friend. Éluard bought two of Ernst's paintings (''Celebes'' and ''Oedipus Rex'') and selected six collages to illustrate his poetry collection ''Répétitions''. A year later the two collaborated on ''Les malheurs des immortels'' and then with [[André Breton]], whom Ernst met in 1921, on the magazine ''[[Littérature (magazine)|Littérature]]''. In 1922, unable to secure the necessary papers, Ernst entered France illegally and settled into a [[ménage à trois]] with Éluard and his wife [[Gala Dalí|Gala]] in Paris suburb Saint-Brice, leaving behind his wife and son.<ref name="chrono285"/> During his first two years in Paris, Ernst took various odd jobs to make a living and continued to paint. In 1923, the Éluards moved to a new home in [[Eaubonne]], near Paris, where Ernst painted numerous [[mural]]s. The same year his works were exhibited at ''Salon des Indépendants''.<ref name="chrono285"/>

Although apparently accepting the ménage à trois, Éluard eventually became more concerned about the affair. In 1924, he abruptly left, first for [[Monaco]] and then for [[Saigon]].<ref>Warlick, M.E. 2001. ''Max Ernst and Alchemy: a Magician in Search of Myth'', p. 83. {{ISBN|978-0-292-79136-7}}</ref> He soon asked his wife and Max Ernst to join him; both had to sell paintings to finance the trip. Ernst went to Düsseldorf and sold a large number of his works to a long-time friend, [[Johanna Ey]], owner of gallery ''Das Junge Rheinland''.<ref name="chrono285"/> After a brief time together in Saigon, the trio decided that Gala would remain with Paul. The Éluards returned to Eaubonne in early September, while Ernst followed them some months later, after exploring more of South-East Asia. He returned to Paris in late 1924 and soon signed a contract with Jacques Viot that allowed him to paint full-time. In 1925, Ernst established a studio at 22, rue Tourlaque.<ref name="chrono285"/>

In 1925, Ernst invented a graphic art technique called [[frottage (surrealist technique)|frottage]] (see [[Surrealist techniques]]), which uses pencil rubbings of objects as a source of images.<ref>Spies et al. 1991, p. 128.</ref> He also created the '[[Grattage (art)|grattage]]' technique, in which paint is scraped across canvas to reveal the imprints of the objects placed beneath. He used this technique in his famous painting ''[[Forest and Dove]]'' (as shown at the Tate Modern). The next year he collaborated with [[Joan Miró]] on designs for [[Sergei Diaghilev]]. With Miró's help, Ernst developed grattage, in which he trowelled pigment from his canvases. He also explored with the technique of [[decalcomania]], which involves pressing paint between two surfaces.<ref>Max Ernst working in decalcomania is shown in the 1978 documentary on the Dada and Surrealist art movement, ''Europe After the Rain''.</ref> Ernst was also active, along with fellow Surrealists, at the [[Atelier 17]].<ref name="Swann Galleries">{{cite web |title=Atelier 17: Europe and the Early Years |url=https://www.swanngalleries.com/news/19th-20th-century-prints-drawings/2011/10/atelier-17-europe-early-years/ |website=Swann Galleries News |access-date=20 February 2020 |date=10 October 2011}}</ref> 

Ernst developed a fascination with birds that was prevalent in his work. His alter ego in paintings, which he called [[Loplop]], was a bird. He suggested that this alter-ego was an extension of himself stemming from an early confusion of birds and humans.<ref>Spies et al. 1991, p. 285.</ref> He said that one night when he was young, he woke up and found that his beloved bird had died; a few minutes later, his father announced that his sister was born. Loplop often appeared in collages of other artists' work, such as ''Loplop presents André Breton''. Ernst drew a great deal of controversy with his 1926 painting ''The Virgin Chastises the infant Jesus before Three Witnesses: André Breton, Paul Éluard, and the Painter''.<ref>Image: [http://www.metmuseum.org/special/Max_Ernst/view_1.asp?item=4&view=l The Blessed Virgin Chastises the Infant Jesus Before Three Witnesses: A.B., P.E. and the Artist]</ref> In 1927, Ernst married {{Ill|Marie-Berthe Aurenche|de}} and it is thought his relationship with her may have inspired the erotic subject matter of ''The Kiss'' and other works of that year.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Flint|first=Lucy, Guggenheim Collection|title=''The Kiss (Le Baiser)''|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/search/?q=76.2553.71|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706214957/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/search/?q=76.2553.71|archive-date=6 July 2015}}</ref> Ernst appeared in the 1930 film ''[[L'Âge d'Or]]'', directed by the [[Surrealist]] [[Luis Buñuel]]. Ernst began to sculpt in 1934 and spent time with [[Alberto Giacometti]]. In 1938, the American heiress and artistic [[patron]] [[Peggy Guggenheim]] acquired a number of Max Ernst's works, which she displayed in her new gallery in London. Ernst and Peggy Guggenheim were married from 1942 to 1946.

===World War II and later life===

In September 1939, the outbreak of [[World War II]] caused Ernst to be interned as an "undesirable foreigner" in [[Camp des Milles]], near [[Aix-en-Provence]], along with fellow Surrealist, [[Hans Bellmer]], who had recently emigrated to Paris. He had been living with his lover and fellow Surrealist painter, [[Leonora Carrington]] who, not knowing whether he would return, saw no option but to sell their house to repay their debts and leave for Spain. Thanks to the intercession of [[Paul Éluard]] and other friends, including the journalist [[Varian Fry]], he was released a few weeks later. Soon after the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|German occupation of France]], he was arrested again, this time by the [[Gestapo]] but managed to escape and flee to America with the help of [[Peggy Guggenheim]], a member of a wealthy American art collecting family, and Fry.<ref name=abc>{{Cite web|last=Olga's Gallery|title=Max Ernst biography|url=http://www.abcgallery.com/E/ernst/ernstbio.html}}</ref> Ernst and Peggy Guggenheim arrived in the United States in 1941 and were married at the end of the year.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Iyengar|first1=Rishi|title=New Google Doodle Honors Surrealist Painter Leonora Carrington|url=http://time.com/3771801/google-doodle-leonora-carrington-surrealist-painter/|access-date=6 April 2015|work=Time|date=6 April 2015}}</ref> Along with other artists and friends ([[Marcel Duchamp]] and [[Marc Chagall]]) who had fled from the war and lived in New York City, Ernst helped inspire the development of [[Abstract expressionism]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Max Ernst GERMAN PAINTER AND SCULPTOR|url=https://www.theartstory.org/artist/ernst-max/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=theartstory}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Max Ernst|url=https://www.ordovasart.com/artist/max-ernst/#:~:text=Max%20Ernst%20was%20one%20of,to%20hold%20great%20sway%20today.|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=Ordovasart}}</ref>

His marriage to Guggenheim did not last and in [[Beverly Hills, California]] in October 1946, in a double ceremony with [[Man Ray]] and Juliet P. Browner, he married [[Dorothea Tanning]].<ref name="Juliet's obituary">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/21/obituaries/juliet-man-ray-79-the-artist-s-model-and-muse-is-dead.html | title=Juliet Man Ray, 79, The Artist's Model And Muse, Is Dead | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=21 January 1991 | access-date=3 December 2014 | author=Flint, Peter B.}}</ref> The couple made their home in [[Sedona, Arizona]] from 1946 to 1953, where the high desert landscapes inspired them and recalled Ernst's earlier imagery.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Waldman|first1=Diane|title=Max Ernst : A Retrospective|date=1975|publisher=Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|location=New York, NY}}</ref> Despite the fact that Sedona was remote and populated by fewer than 400 ranchers, orchard workers, merchants and small Native American communities, their presence helped begin what would become an American [[artists' colony]]. Among the monumental red rocks, Ernst built a small cottage with his own hands on Brewer Road and he and Tanning hosted intellectuals and European artists such as [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]] and [[Yves Tanguy]]. Sedona proved an inspiration for the artists and for Ernst, who compiled his book ''Beyond Painting'' and completed his sculptural masterpiece ''Capricorn'' while living in Sedona. As a result of the book and its publicity, Ernst began to achieve financial success. From the 1950s he lived mainly in France. In 1954 he was awarded the Grand Prize for painting at the [[Venice Biennale]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/max-ernst-1065 | work = Tate Etc. | title = Max Ernst 1891–1976}}</ref> He died at the age of 84 on 1 April 1976 in Paris and was interred at [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]].<ref name=abc/>

==Legacy==
Ernst's son [[Jimmy Ernst]], a well-known German/American [[abstract expressionist]] painter, who lived on the south shore of [[Long Island]], died in 1984. His memoirs, ''A Not-So-Still Life'', were published shortly before his death. Max Ernst's grandson Eric and his granddaughter Amy are both artists and writers.{{fact|date=October 2020}}

Max Ernst's life and career are examined in [[Peter Schamoni]]'s 1991 documentary ''Max Ernst''. Dedicated to the art historian [[Werner Spies]], it was assembled from interviews with Ernst, stills of his paintings and sculptures, and the memoirs of his wife Dorothea Tanning and son Jimmy. The 101-minute German film was released on DVD with English subtitles by Image Entertainment.

The '''Max Ernst Museum''' opened in 2005 in his home town Brühl, Germany. It is housed in a late-classicist 1844 building integrated with a modern glass pavilion. The historic ballroom was once a popular social venue visited by Ernst in his youth. The collection spans 70 years of his career including paintings, drawings, frottages, collages, nearly the entire lithographic works, over 70 bronze sculptures. and more than 700 documents and photographs by [[Man Ray]], [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]], [[Lee Miller]], and others. The core of the collection dates back to 1969 with works donated to the City of Brühl by the artist. Thirty-six paintings, gifts from the artist to his fourth wife [[Dorothea Tanning]], are on permanent loan from the Kreissparkasse Köln. Some noteworthy works include the sculptures ''The King playing with the Queen'' (1944) and ''Teaching Staff for a School of Murderers'' (1967). The museum also host temporary exhibitions by other artist.<ref>[https://maxernstmuseum.lvr.de/en/startseite_1.html Max Ernst Museum], Brühl, Germany (accessed 11 February 2021)</ref>

The '''[[Menil Collection]]''', in [[Houston]], Texas houses a significant collection of surrealist art including well over 100 pieces by Max Ernst. Notable paintings include ''In Praise of Freedom'' (1926), ''[[Loplop|Loplop Presents Loplop]]'' (1930), ''Day and Night'' (1941–1942), ''Surrealism and Painting'' (1942), ''Euclid'' (1945), ''A Swarm of Bees in the Palais de Justice'' (1960), ''The Marriage of Heaven and Earth'' (1964). Ernst's work in the Menil Collection is typically exhibited a few pieces at a time along with other surrealist art in the collection on a rotating basis.<ref>The Menil Collection: [https://www.menil.org/collection/5136-surrealism Surrealism] (accessed 11 February 2021)</ref>

* American rock group [[Mission of Burma]] titled two songs after the artist: "Max Ernst" was the b-side of their first 1980 single (now included on the CD of ''[[Signals, Calls and Marches]]''), mentioning two of Ernst's paintings (''The Blessed Virgin Chastises the Infant Jesus'' and ''Garden Airplane-Trap'') and ending with the words "Dada dada dada ..." repeated many times and distorted via [[tape loop]]; their 2002 album ''OnOffOn'' features "Max Ernst's Dream".
* Writer [[J. G. Ballard]] makes numerous references to the art works of Max Ernst in his breakthrough novel ''[[The Drowned World]]'' (1962) and the experimental collection of short stories ''[[The Atrocity Exhibition]]'' (1970).
* ''Europe After the Rain'' was used by musician [[John Foxx]] as the title for the opening track of his 1981 album ''[[The Garden (John Foxx album)|The Garden]]''.
* Max Ernst himself, and some of his work, is mentioned in [[William Gibson]]'s novel ''[[Count Zero]]'' (1986), the second novel of the [[Sprawl trilogy]], an influential set of books which established the [[cyberpunk]] subgenre of science-fiction
* ''(The) Eye of Silence'' was used by musician Cavestar (Kevin Crosslin) as the title of a track from his 1997 album ''Cavestar''.
* The first edition of the Penguin paperback edition of [[James Blish]]'s ''[[A Case of Conscience]]'' uses details from ''The Eye of Silence'' as cover art.
* Ernst's alter-ego [[Loplop]] appears in [[China Miéville]]'s 1998 debut novel ''[[King Rat (Miéville novel)|King Rat]]'', the Garden Aeroplane Trap also (literally) appears in Mievielle's "The Last Days of New Paris" .
* German experimental electronic musician [[Thomas Brinkmann]] has made numerous references to Max Ernst and Loplop in his productions and record labels.
