'''Stephen Glenn Martin''' (born August 14, 1945) is an American actor, comedian, writer, producer, and musician. Over his distinguished career he has earned five [[Grammy Awards]], a [[Primetime Emmy Award]], and was awarded an [[Honorary Academy Award]] at the Academy's 5th Annual [[Governors Awards]] in 2013.<ref>{{cite magazine| title=Academy Unveils 2013 Governors Awards: Honorees Angelina Jolie, Angela Lansbury, Steve Martin, Piero Tosi| url=https://www.deadline.com/2013/09/governors-awards-2013-winners-academy-oscars/| magazine=Deadline Hollywood| date=September 5, 2013| access-date=October 26, 2013}}</ref> Among [[List of awards and nominations received by Steve Martin|many honors]], he has received the [[Mark Twain Prize for American Humor]], the [[Kennedy Center Honors]], and an [[AFI Life Achievement Award]]. In 2004, [[Comedy Central]] ranked Martin at sixth place in a list of the 100 greatest stand-up comics.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://everything2.com/title/Comedy+Central%2527s+100+Greatest+Stand-Ups+of+all+Time| title=Comedy Central's 100 Greatest Stand-Ups of all Time| date=April 18, 2014| website=Everything2}}</ref>

Martin came to public notice in the 1960s as a writer for ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'', and later as a frequent host on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. In the 1970s, Martin performed his offbeat, [[Surreal humour|absurdist]] comedy routines before sold-out theaters on national tours. Since the 1980s, having retired from stand-up comedy, Martin has become a successful actor, starring in such films as ''[[The Jerk]]'' (1979), ''[[Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid]]'' (1982), ''[[The Man with Two Brains]]'' (1983), ''[[Three Amigos]]'' (1986), ''[[Planes, Trains and Automobiles]]'' (1987), ''[[Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (film)|Dirty Rotten Scoundrels]]'' (1988), ''[[Sgt. Bilko]]'' (1996), ''[[Bowfinger]]'' (1999) and ''[[Looney Tunes: Back in Action]]'' (2003). He has also starred as the family patriarch in ''[[Parenthood (1989 film)|Parenthood]]'' (1989), the ''[[Father of the Bride (1991 film)|Father of the Bride]]'' films (1991–1995), and the ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen (2003 film)|Cheaper by the Dozen]]'' films (2003–2005). In 2021, he co-created and starred in a [[Hulu]] comedy series ''[[Only Murders in the Building]]''.

Martin is also known for writing the book and lyrics to the musical ''[[Bright Star (musical)|Bright Star]]'' (2016), and the comedy ''[[Meteor Shower (play)|Meteor Shower]]'' (2017) both of which premiered on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. While he has played [[banjo]] since an early age, and included music in his comedy routines from the beginning of his professional career, he has increasingly dedicated his career to music since the 2000s, acting less and spending much of his professional life playing banjo, recording, and touring with various [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] acts, including [[Earl Scruggs]], with whom he won a [[Grammy]] for Best Country Instrumental Performance in 2002. His first solo music album, ''[[The Crow: New Songs for the 5-String Banjo]]'' (2009) received the [[Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/steve-martin/4314|title= Steve Martin - Artist|website= [[Grammy Awards|grammy.com]]|date= November 23, 2020|accessdate= June 30, 2021}}</ref>

==Early life and education==

Martin is of English, [[Scottish people|Scottish]], [[Welsh people|Welsh]], [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scots-Irish]], German and French descent, and was raised in [[Inglewood, California]], with sister Melinda Martin, and then later in [[Garden Grove, California]], in a [[Baptist]] family.<ref>Martin (2007) pp.20–39</ref> Martin was a cheerleader of [[Garden Grove High School]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/feb/20/top-5-famous-former-male-cheerleaders/ |title=Top 5: Famous former male cheerleaders |date=February 20, 2009 |work=The Washington Times}}</ref> One of his earliest memories is of seeing his father, as an extra, serving drinks onstage at the Call Board Theatre on Melrose Place. During [[World War II]], in the United Kingdom, Martin's father had appeared in a production of ''[[Our Town]]'' with [[Raymond Massey]]. Expressing his affection through gifts, like cars and bikes, Martin's father was stern, and not emotionally open to his son.<ref Name="Mild"/> He was proud but critical, with Martin later recalling that in his teens his feelings for his father were mostly of [[hatred]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Wills |first=Dominic |title= Steve Martin – Biography
|url = http://www.talktalk.co.uk/entertainment/film/biography/artist/steve-martin/biography/118 |publisher=TalkTalk |access-date=May 15, 2010}}</ref>

Martin's first job was at [[Disneyland]], selling guidebooks on weekends and full-time during his school's summer break. That lasted for three years (1955–1958). During his free time, he frequented the [[Main Street, U.S.A.#Shops|Main Street Magic shop]], where tricks were demonstrated to patrons.<ref Name="Mild"/> While working at Disneyland, he was captured in the background of the [[home movie]] that was made into the short-subject film ''[[Disneyland Dream]]'', incidentally becoming his first film appearance.  By 1960, he had mastered several magic tricks and illusions and took a paying job at the Magic shop in [[Fantasyland]] in August. There he perfected his talents for magic, juggling, and creating balloon animals in the manner of mentor [[Wally Boag]],<ref name=Boag>Martin (2007) p18–19</ref> frequently performing for tips.<ref>Martin (2007) p 39</ref>

In his authorized biography, close friend Morris Walker suggests that Martin could "be described most accurately as an agnostic ... he rarely went to church and was never involved in organized religion of his own volition".<ref>Walker (1999) p. 40.</ref> In his early 20s, Martin dated Melissa Trumbo, daughter of novelist and screenwriter [[Dalton Trumbo]].

After high school, Martin attended [[Santa Ana College]], taking classes in drama and English poetry. In his free time, he teamed up with friend and [[Garden Grove High School]] classmate Kathy Westmoreland to participate in comedies and other productions at the Bird Cage Theatre. He joined a comedy troupe at [[Knott's Berry Farm]].<ref Name="Mild"/> Later, he met budding actress [[Stormie Omartian|Stormie Sherk]], and they developed comedy routines and became romantically involved. Sherk's influence caused Martin to apply to the [[California State University, Long Beach]], for enrollment with a major in philosophy.<ref Name="Mild"/> Sherk enrolled at [[UCLA]], about an hour's drive north, and the distance eventually caused them to lead separate lives.<ref>Martin (2007) p 65</ref>

Inspired by his philosophy classes, Martin considered becoming a professor instead of an actor-comedian. His time at college changed his life. {{cquote|It changed what I believe and what I think about everything. I majored in philosophy. Something about [[Non sequitur (absurdism)|non-sequiturs]] appealed to me. In philosophy, I started studying [[logic]], and they were talking about [[Causality|cause and effect]], and you start to realize, 'Hey, there is no cause and effect! There is no logic! There is no anything!' Then it gets real easy to write this stuff because all you have to do is twist everything hard—you twist the [[climax (narrative)|punch line]], you twist the [[Non sequitur (absurdism)|non-sequitur]] so hard away from the things that set it up.<ref name="RS">{{cite news |last1=Fong-Torres |first1=Ben |title=Steve Martin's New Song and Dance |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/steve-martins-new-song-and-dance-80065/ |access-date=2020-01-16 |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=18 February 1982}}</ref>}} Martin recalls reading a treatise on comedy that led him to think: {{cquote|What if there were no punch lines? What if there were no indicators? What if I created tension and never released it? What if I headed for a climax, but all I delivered was an anticlimax? What would the audience do with all that tension? Theoretically, it would have to come out sometime. But if I kept denying them the formality of a punch line, the audience would eventually pick their own place to laugh, essentially out of desperation.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Martin |first=Steve |date=February 2008 |title=Being Funny: How the path-breaking comedian got his act together |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/being-funny-17061140 |magazine=Smithsonian |access-date=August 14, 2010}}</ref>}} Martin periodically spoofed his philosophy studies in his 1970s stand-up act, comparing philosophy with studying geology. {{cquote|If you're studying geology, which is all facts, as soon as you get out of school you forget it all, but philosophy you remember just enough to screw you up for the rest of your life.<ref>{{IMDb name|0000188}}</ref>}}

In 1967, Martin transferred to [[UCLA]] and switched his major to theater. While attending college, he appeared in an episode of ''[[The Dating Game]]'', winning a date with [[Deana Martin]]. Martin began working local clubs at night, to mixed notices, and at twenty-one, he dropped out of college.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stevemartin.com/stop_the_presses/newsweek_78.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227054918/http://www.stevemartin.com/stop_the_presses/newsweek_78.php|url-status=dead|title=SteveMartin.com &#124; Stop the Presses|archive-date=February 27, 2009|access-date=April 8, 2020}}</ref>

==Career==

===Stand-up comedy ===
==== Late night ====
In 1967, his former girlfriend Nina Goldblatt, a dancer on ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'', helped Martin land a writing job with the show by submitting his work to head writer [[Mason Williams]].<ref>Martin, (2007) p. 76</ref> Williams initially paid Martin out of his own pocket. Along with the other writers for the show, Martin won an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/steve-martin|title=Steve Martin|work=Television Academy}}</ref> in 1969 at the age of twenty-three.<ref name="Mild"/> He wrote for ''[[The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour]]'' and ''[[The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour]].'' Martin's first television appearance was on ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'' in 1968. He says: {{cquote|[I] appeared on ''The [[Virginia Graham]] Show,'' circa 1970. I looked grotesque. I had a hairdo like a helmet, which I blow-dried to a puffy bouffant, for reasons I no longer understand. I wore a frock coat and a silk shirt, and my delivery was mannered, slow and self-aware. I had absolutely no authority. After reviewing the show, I was depressed for a week.<ref name="Smith" />}} During these years his roommates included [[Gary Mule Deer]] and [[Michael Johnson (singer)|Michael Johnson]].<ref>Martin, (2007) p. 77</ref> Martin opened for groups such as [[The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]] (who returned the favor by appearing in his 1980 television special ''All Commercials''), [[The Carpenters]], and [[Toto (band)|Toto]]. He appeared at [[The Boarding House (nightclub)|The Boarding House]], among other venues. He continued to write, earning an Emmy nomination for his work on ''[[Dick Van Dyke|Van Dyke and Company]]'' in 1976.
In the mid-1970s, Martin made frequent appearances as a stand-up comedian on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'',<ref name="Smith">{{cite web |last=Martin |first=teve |year=2008 |title=Being Funny |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/funny-martin-200802.html |archive-date=October 14, 2009 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091014124041/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts%2Dculture/funny%2Dmartin%2D200802.html |url-status=dead |work=[[Smithsonian Magazine]] |access-date=February 22, 2008}}</ref> and on  ''[[The Gong Show]]'', [[HBO]]'s ''[[On Location (TV series)|On Location]]'', ''[[The Muppet Show]]'',<ref>{{cite book |last1=Garlen |first1=Jennifer C. |last2=Graham |first2=Anissa M.  |title=Kermit Culture: Critical Perspectives on Jim Henson's Muppets |year=2009 |publisher=[[McFarland & Company]] |isbn=978-0786442591|page=[https://www.google.com/books/edition/Kermit_Culture/Rac9xis0BIgC?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=%22Steve%20Martin%22 16]|url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Kermit_Culture/Rac9xis0BIgC?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=%22Steve%20Martin%22}}</ref> and [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (''SNL''). ''SNL''{{'s}} audience jumped by a million viewers when he made guest appearances, and he was one of the show's most successful hosts.<ref name="Mild"/> Martin has appeared on twenty-seven ''Saturday Night Live'' shows and guest-hosted fifteen times, second only to [[Alec Baldwin]], who has hosted seventeen times {{as of|2017|February|lc=y}}.

On the night she died of [[ovarian cancer]], a visibly shaken Martin hosted ''SNL'' and featured footage of himself and Radner together in a 1978 sketch.

==== Comedy albums ====
[[File:Steve Martin 2.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Steve Martin, 1976]]
In the 1970s, his television appearances led to the release of comedy albums that went [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]].<ref name="Mild"/> The track "Excuse Me" on his first album, ''[[Let's Get Small]]'' (1977), helped establish a national [[catch phrase]].<ref name="Mild"/> His next album, ''[[A Wild and Crazy Guy]]'' (1978), was an even bigger success, reaching the No. 2 spot on the U.S. sales chart, selling over a million copies. "Just a wild and crazy guy" became another of Martin's known catchphrases.<ref name="Mild"/> The album featured a character based on a series of ''Saturday Night Live'' sketches in which Martin and [[Dan Aykroyd]] played the Festrunk Brothers; Yortuk and Georgi were bumbling [[Czechoslovak]] would-be playboys. The album ends with the song "[[King Tut (song)|King Tut]]", sung and written by Martin and backed by the "Toot Uncommons," members of the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]]. It was later released as a single, reaching No. 17 on the U.S. charts in 1978 and selling over a million copies.<ref name="Mild">{{cite news |last1=Corliss |first1=Richard |title=Steve Martin, a Mild and Crazy Guy |url=https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1684540,00.html |access-date=January 13, 2020 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=November 15, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220021910/http://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1684540,00.html |archive-date=December 20, 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{YouTube|wgTPH5y1-ZI|"King Tut" Video}}. Retrieved August 14, 2010.</ref> The song came out during the [[Tutankhamun|King Tut]] craze that accompanied the popular traveling exhibit of the Egyptian king's tomb artifacts. Both albums won [[Grammy]]s for [[Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album|Best Comedy Recording]] in 1977 and 1978, respectively. Martin performed "King Tut" on April 22, 1978, ''SNL'' program.

Decades later, in 2012, ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' described Martin's unique style and its effect on audiences:
{{cquote|[Martin was] both a consummate entertainer and a glib, knowing parody of a consummate entertainer. He was at once a hammy populist with an uncanny, unprecedented feel for the tastes of a mass audience and a sly intellectual whose goofy shtick cunningly deconstructed stand-up comedy.<ref>{{cite web |last=Rabin |first=Nathan |title=Steve Martin: The Television Stuff |url=https://www.avclub.com/articles/steve-martin-the-television-stuff,88419/ |publisher=Onion Inc. |access-date=December 10, 2012}}</ref>}}

On his comedy albums, Martin's stand-up is self-referential and sometimes [[self-deprecation|self-mocking]]. It mixes philosophical riffs with sudden spurts of "happy feet", [[banjo]] playing with balloon depictions of concepts like [[venereal disease]], and the "controversial" kitten juggling (he is a master juggler; the "kittens" were stuffed animals). His style is off-kilter and ironic and sometimes pokes fun at stand-up comedy traditions, such as Martin opening his act (from ''A Wild and Crazy Guy'') by saying: {{cquote|I think there's nothing better for a person to come up and do the same thing over and over for two weeks. This is what I enjoy, so I'm going to do the same thing over and over and over [...] I'm going to do the same joke over and over in the same show, it'll be like a new thing.}}  Or: "Hello, I'm Steve Martin, and I'll be out here in a minute."<ref name="Frum"/><ref>[https://nymag.com/arts/books/features/40968/"Rationalist of the Absurd: Steve Martin's extraordinarily calculated comedy".''New York Books'' November 18, 2007].

The riff took on a life of its own. There is a Gern Blanston website, and for a time a rock band took the moniker as its name.<ref>Martin (2007) p176–77</ref>

Martin's show soon required full-sized stadiums for the audiences he was drawing. Concerned about his visibility in venues on such a scale, Martin began to wear a distinctive [[three piece suit|three-piece]] white suit that became a trademark for his act.<ref>{{cite news |last1=O'Reilly |first1=Terry |title=How A Wardrobe Change Transformed Steve Martin's Career |url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/undertheinfluence/how-a-wardrobe-change-transformed-steve-martin-s-career-1.4525782 |access-date=February 18, 2018 |work=Under the Influence |agency=Pirate Radio |publisher=CBC Radio One |date=February 8, 2018}}</ref> Martin stopped doing stand-up comedy in 1981 to concentrate on movies and did not return for thirty-five years.<ref name="Mild"/> About this decision, he states "My act was conceptual. Once the concept was stated, and everybody understood it, it was done. ... It was about coming to the end of the road. There was no way to live on in that persona. I had to take that fabulous luck of not being remembered as that, exclusively. You know, I didn't announce that I was stopping.

==== Return to standup ====
In 2016, Martin made a low-key comeback to live comedy, opening for [[Jerry Seinfeld]]. He performed a ten-minute stand-up routine before turning the stage over to Seinfeld.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/feb/19/jerry-seinfeld-steve-martin-review-standup-comedy-new-york |title=Jerry Seinfeld and Steve Martin standup comedy review – superbly honed |first=Elise |last=Czajkowski |date=February 19, 2016 |newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref> Also in 2016 he staged a national tour with [[Martin Short]] and the [[Steep Canyon Rangers]], which yielded a 2018 Netflix comedy special, ''Steve Martin and Martin Short: An Evening You Will Forget for the Rest of Your Life''.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Husband |first=Andrew |date=May 25, 2018 |title=Steve Martin And Martin Short Embrace The Past Even When They Shun It |magazine=[[Forbes]] |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewhusband/2018/05/25/steve-martin-martin-short-netflix-special-review/ |access-date=May 27, 2018}}</ref> The special received four [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations with Martin receiving two nominations for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Special|Outstanding Writing for a Variety Special]] and [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics|Outstanding Music and Lyrics]] for ''The Buddy Song''.

=== Acting career===
[[File:Steve Martin.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Martin in 1982]]
==== 1970s ====
By the end of the 1970s, Martin had acquired the kind of following normally reserved for rock stars, with his tour appearances typically occurring at sold-out arenas filled with tens of thousands of screaming fans. But unknown to his audience, stand-up comedy was "just an accident" for him; his real goal was to get into film.<ref name=RS/>

Martin had a small role in the 1972 film ''[[Another Nice Mess]]''. In 1974 he starred in the Canadian travelogue production The Funnier Side Of Eastern Canada, created to promote tourism in Montreal and Toronto, which also included standup segments filmed at the Ice House in Pasadena, California.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Leeson |first1=Jef |year=2021 |title=The Funnier Side Of Eastern Canada |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390033|access-date=August 20, 2021}}</ref> His first substantial film appearance was in a [[short film|short]] titled ''[[The Absent-Minded Waiter]]'' (1977). The seven-minute-long film, also featuring [[Buck Henry]] and [[Teri Garr]], was written by and starred Martin. The film was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] as [[Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film|''Best Short Film, Live Action'']]. He made his first substantial feature film appearance in the musical ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (film)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', where he sang [[The Beatles]]' "[[Maxwell's Silver Hammer]]". In 1979, Martin starred in the comedy film ''[[The Jerk]]'', directed by [[Carl Reiner]], and written by Martin, Michael Elias, and [[Carl Gottlieb]]. The film was a huge success, grossing over $100&nbsp;million on a budget of approximately $4&nbsp;million.

[[Stanley Kubrick]] met with him to discuss the possibility of Martin starring in a screwball comedy version of ''[[Dream Story|Traumnovelle]]'' (Kubrick later changed his approach to the material, the result of which was 1999's ''[[Eyes Wide Shut]]''). Martin was executive producer for ''Domestic Life'', a prime-time television series starring friend [[Martin Mull]], and a late-night series called ''Twilight Theater''. It emboldened Martin to try his hand at his first serious film, ''[[Pennies from Heaven (1981 film)|Pennies from Heaven]]'' (1981), based on the [[Pennies from Heaven (TV series)|1978 BBC serial]] by [[Dennis Potter]]. He was anxious to perform in the movie because of his desire to avoid being [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]]. To prepare for that film, Martin took acting lessons from director [[Herbert Ross]] and spent months learning how to [[tap dance]]. The film was a financial failure; Martin's comment at the time was "I don't know what to blame, other than it's me and not a comedy."<ref>''American film'' Volume 7. 1981.

===Music career===
==== Banjo music ====
[[File:Steve Martin & The Steep Canyon Rangers in Seattle.JPG|right|thumb|Martin playing with the Steep Canyon Rangers in Seattle in November 2009]]
Martin first picked up the banjo when he was around 17 years of age. Martin has stated in several interviews and in his memoir, ''Born Standing Up'', that he used to take 33 rpm [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] records and slow them down to 16 rpm and tune his banjo down, so the notes would sound the same. Martin was able to pick out each note and perfect his playing.{{Citation needed|reason=|date=October 2020}} Martin learned how to play the banjo with help from [[John McEuen]], who later joined the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]]. McEuen's brother later managed Martin as well as the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. Martin did his stand-up routine opening for the band in the early 1970s. He had the band play on his hit song "King Tut", being credited as "The Toot Uncommons" (as in [[Tutankhamun]]).{{Citation needed|reason=|date=October 2020}} The banjo was a staple of Martin's 1970s stand-up career, and he periodically poked fun at his love for the instrument.<ref Name="Smith"/> On the ''[[Comedy Is Not Pretty!]]'' album, he included an all-instrumental jam, titled "Drop Thumb Medley", and played the track on his 1979 concert tour. His final comedy album, ''[[The Steve Martin Brothers]]'' (1981), featured one side of Martin's typical stand-up material, with the other side featuring live performances of Steve playing banjo with a bluegrass band.

In 2001, he played banjo on [[Earl Scruggs]]'s remake of "[[Foggy Mountain Breakdown]]". The recording was the winner of the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance|Best Country Instrumental Performance]] category at the [[Grammy Awards of 2002]].
