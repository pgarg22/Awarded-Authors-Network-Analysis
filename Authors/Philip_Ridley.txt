Although Ridley creates stories through a wide range of media, he dislikes his work being categorised by the medium in which it is told, often referring to them belonging to each other as "different peaks of the same mountain."<ref>{{cite web |last=Janisse |first=Kier-La |title=Reflecting Skin director Philip Ridley returns with horror stunner HEARTLESS |url=http://www.fantasiafestival.com/blog/premieres/reflecting-skin-director-philip-ridley-returns-with-horror-stunner-heartless |website=Fantasia Festival |access-date=19 May 2016 |date=14 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Parton |first=Russell |title=Philip Ridley: 'You cannot predict what's going to cause outrage' |url=http://www.eastendreview.co.uk/2015/03/06/philip-ridley-radiant-vermin/ |access-date=20 May 2016 |website=East End Review |date=6 March 2015}}</ref>

===Work in Cinema===

After graduating from St Martin's, Ridley created the short film, ''Visiting Mr Beak'' (1987), which starred the veteran actor [[Guy Rolfe]]. He later created a short film for Channel 4 called ''The Universe of Dermot Finn'' (1988), which featured renowned actress [[Sheila Hancock]] and was officially selected for the Cannes Film Festival, where it was a critical success and went on to receive theatrical distribution.

While still a student at St Martin's, Ridley wrote a screenplay for ''[[The Krays (film)|The Krays]]'' (1990), which was directed by [[Peter Medak]] and starred real life brothers [[Gary Kemp]] and [[Martin Kemp]], who previously were recognised for their band, [[Spandau Ballet]].

In 1996 Hungary's Titanic Film Festival had a major retrospective of Ridley's work.

===Work in Theatre===

Ridley has written 15 adult stage plays: the seminal ''[[The Pitchfork Disney]]'' (1990), the multi-award-winning ''[[The Fastest Clock in the Universe]]'' (1992), ''[[Ghost from a Perfect Place]]'' (1994), ''[[Vincent River (play)|Vincent River]]'' (2000), the controversial ''[[Mercury Fur]]'' (2005), ''[[Leaves of Glass]]'' (2007), ''[[Piranha Heights]]'' (2008), ''[[Tender Napalm]]'' (2011), ''[[Shivered (play)|Shivered]]'' (2012), ''Dark Vanilla Jungle'' (2013), ''Radiant Vermin'' (2015), ''Tonight with Donny Stixx'' (2015), ''Karagula'' (2016), and ''[[The Poltergeist (play)|The Poltergeist]]'' (2020).

Ridley has also written various monologues, many of which have been selectively performed together onstage. This includes ''Killer'' (consisting of the monologues ''Killer'', ''Sledgehammers'', and ''Vesper'') performed in 2017, ''Angry'' (consisting of the monologues ''Angry'', ''Okay'', ''Bloodshot'', ''Dancing'', ''Now'', and ''Air'') performed in 2018, and ''The Beast Will Rise'' (consisting of the monologues ''Performance'', ''Gators'', ''Star'', ''Rosewater'', and ''Cactus'') performed in 2020.

Ridley is additionally known for his series of plays for young people (known collectively as ''[[The Storyteller Sequence]]''), consisting of ''[[The Storyteller Sequence#Karamazoo (2006)|Karamazoo]]'' (2004), ''[[The Storyteller Sequence#Fairytaleheart (1998)|Fairytaleheart]]'' (1998), ''[[The Storyteller Sequence#Moonfleece (2004)|Moonfleece]]'' (2004), ''[[Sparkleshark]]'', and ''[[The Storyteller Sequence#Brokenville (2003)|Brokenville]]'' (2003).

He has also written two plays for young children, ''Daffodil Scissors'' (2004) and ''Krindlekrax'' (2002) - a stage adaptation of his successful children's novel of the same name - as well as a play for the whole family, ''Feathers in the Snow'' (2012).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vampire-world.com/filmpages/einzelnefime/schreiinderstille.htm |title=Filmreviews: "Schrei in der Stille", Philip Ridley, 1989 |website=Vampire-World.com |access-date=10 September 2017}}</ref>

Ridley was one of 25 contemporary British writers asked to contribute a scene to ''NT25 Chain Play'', celebrating 25 years of the [[Royal National Theatre]] in London.

===Work in Music===

Ridley's output as a lyricist has produced a wide range of songs, a number of which have featured in a variety of his plays, films, and novels. As a student Ridley participated in music by creating work with a band called Haunted Staircase (who released their double-sided record ''Flutters'' in the early 1980s) and also worked as a [[DJ]] at a nightclub.

As a songwriter he has regularly collaborated with the composer, Nick Bicât. For Ridley's film, ''The Passion of Darkly Noon'', they created two songs: "Look What You've Done" (sung by [[Gavin Friday]]) and "Who Will Love Me Now?" (sung by [[PJ Harvey]]), the latter of which was voted as [[BBC Radio 1]]'s Best Film Song of 1998. It was later covered by the techno/house band [[Sunscreem]] as ''Please Save Me'', whose cover entered the [[UK top 40]] chart, became a cult hit in clubs, and featured in the film ''[[South West 9]]''. For his film ''Heartless'' Ridley and Bicât created ten songs (performed by Mary Leay, Joe Echo, and lead actor Jim Sturgess).

In 2010 Ridley and Bicât formed the music group, 'Dreamskin Cradle' (with singer Mary Leay). The group's first album, ''Songs from Grimm'' (2014), consisted of twelve songs inspired by female characters in [[Brothers Grimm]] [[fairy tales]] and was released on all major download sites.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://us5.campaign-archive1.com/?u=6f84bab592a657a3b330b39b2&id=8feb078426 |title='Songs From Grimm' - now released on all music platforms |website=Nick Bicat |access-date=10 September 2017}}</ref> Some songs from the album were performed as part of a live performance called ''Grimm Tales'', which was developed by the St Paul's Institute and featured readings from the actress [[Jeany Spark]], reflections from [[Canon (priest)|Canon]] Edmund Newell, and extracts from Brothers Grimm fairy tales adapted by [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|poet laureate]] [[Carol Ann Duffy]]. Dreamskin Cradle have also released two singles: ''Fade and Float'' (written for Ridley's stage play, ''Tender Napalm'') and ''Ladybird First'' (written for Ridley's stage play, ''Dark Vanilla Jungle'').

Ridley also has written the libretto of an opera for teenagers titled ''Tarantula in Petrol Blue'', composed by Anna Meredith, which had its premiere in 2009.

===Other Artistic Work===

Riley is a photographer, with his images appearing on the covers of a number of his published plays. He also has had a number of photography exhibitions mainly consisting of portraits of his friends and images of East London.

Ridley is also a poet, with some of his poetry published in a number of anthologies, and has earned a following for his ongoing series of performance poetry, ''Lovesongs for Extinct Creatures''.

Ridley has won both the ''[[Evening Standard]]''{{'}}s Most Promising Newcomer to [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British Film]] and Most Promising Playwright Awards. He is the only person ever to receive both prizes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ratatoulha.chez-alice.fr/anglais/ridley.html |first=Sébastien |last=Cagnoli |title=Philip Ridley Chronologie |website=ratatoulha.chez-alice.fr |language=fr |access-date=10 September 2017}}</ref>
