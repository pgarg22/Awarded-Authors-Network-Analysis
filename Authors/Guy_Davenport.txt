'''Guy Mattison Davenport''' (November 23, 1927 – January 4, 2005) was an American writer, translator, illustrator, painter, intellectual, and teacher.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/guy-davenport| title= Guy Davenport|publisher= Poetry Foundation |access-date=2019-04-08}}</ref>

==Life==
Guy Davenport was born in [[Anderson, South Carolina]], in the foothills of [[Appalachia]] on November 23, 1927. His father was an agent for the [[Railway Express Agency]]. Davenport said that he became a reader only at 10, with a neighbor’s gift of one of the [[Tarzan]] series.<ref name="Davenport, Guy 1996">Davenport, Guy. "On Reading." ''The Hunter Gracchus''.

He was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]] his junior year.

Davenport was a [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholar]] at [[Merton College, Oxford]] from 1948 to 1950.<ref name="MCreg">{{cite book|editor1-last=Levens|editor1-first=R.G.C.|title=Merton College Register 1900-1964|date=1964|publisher=Basil Blackwell|location=Oxford|page=388}}</ref> He studied [[Old English]] under [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] and graduated with a [[B.Litt.]], with a thesis on [[James Joyce]]. In 1950, upon his return to the United States, Davenport was drafted into the US Army for two years, spending them at [[Fort Bragg, North Carolina|Fort Bragg]] in the 756th [[Field Artillery]], then in the [[XVIII Airborne Corps]]. After the army, he taught at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] until 1955, when he began earning a [[Ph.D.]] at [[Harvard University|Harvard]],<ref name=MCreg /> studying under [[Harry Levin]] and [[Archibald MacLeish]].

Davenport befriended [[Ezra Pound]] during the poet's incarceration in [[St. Elizabeths Hospital]], visiting him annually from 1952 until Pound's release, in 1958, and later at Pound's home in [[Rapallo]], [[Italy]]. Davenport described one such visit, in 1963, in the story "Ithaka". Davenport wrote his dissertation on Pound's poetry, published as ''Cities on Hills'' in 1983. This interest led him to [[Hugh Kenner]], who became one of his most important literary friends. They carried on a voluminous correspondence from 1958 till 2002, as recorded in the book ''Questioning Minds: The Letters of Guy Davenport and Hugh Kenner''.

After completing his Ph.D., he taught at [[Haverford College]] from 1961 to 1963 but soon took a position at the [[University of Kentucky]], "the remotest offer with the most pay," as he wrote to [[Jonathan Williams (poet)|Jonathan Williams]]. Davenport taught at Kentucky until he received a [[MacArthur Fellowship]], which prompted his retirement, at the end of 1990.

Davenport was married briefly in the early 1960s.<ref>''A Garden Carried in a Pocket: Letters 1964–1968'', ed. Thomas Meyer (Green Shade, 2004). 41.</ref> He dedicated ''Eclogues'', 1981, to "Bonnie Jean" (Cox), his companion from 1965<ref>''A Garden Carried in a Pocket: Letters 1964–1968'', ed.

January 7, 2005. https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/07/books/07davenport.html</ref> Other Davenport volumes dedicated to Cox include ''Objects on a Table'' (1998) and ''The Death of Picasso'' (2004). Cox became Trustee for the Guy Davenport Estate.<ref>Kilmer, Nicholas. "Fragments from a Correspondence / Guy Davenport." ''Arion''. Winter, 2006. 129, footnote 57.</ref>
 
In one of his essays, Davenport claimed to "live almost exclusively off fried baloney, Campbell's soup, and Snickers bars."<ref>"The Anthropology of Table Manners from Geophagy Onward", The Geography of the Imagination, p. 349</ref>

He died of lung cancer on January 4, 2005, in [[Lexington, Kentucky]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/07/books/07davenport.html|title= Guy Davenport Dies at 77; Prolific Author and Illustrator|author= Lehmann-Haupt, Christopher|date= January 7, 2005|work= The New York Times|access-date=June 1, 2010}}</ref>

==Writing==
Davenport began publishing fiction in 1970 with "The Aeroplanes at [[Brescia]]," which is based on [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]]'s visit to an air show in September 1909.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Ormsby |first=Eric |url=http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/Glide-of-eye---sizzle-of-tongue-7798|title = Glide of eye & sizzle of tongue|website=The New Criterion|date=January 2014 |access-date=June 22, 2012}}</ref> His books include ''[[Vladimir Tatlin|Tatlin]]!'', ''[[Leonardo da Vinci|Da Vinci]]'s Bicycle'', ''[[Eclogue]]s'', ''Apples and Pears'', ''The [[Jules Verne]] Steam Balloon'', ''The Drummer of the Eleventh North [[Devon]]shire [[Fusilier]]s'', ''A Table of Green Fields'', ''The [[Cardiff]] Team'', and ''Wo es war, soll ich werden''. His fiction uses three general modes of exposition: the fictionalizing of historical events and figures; the foregrounding of formal narrative experiments, especially with the use of [[collage]]; and the depicting of a [[Charles Fourier|Fourierist]] [[utopia]], where small groups of men, women, and children have eliminated the separation between mind and body.

The first of more than four hundred Davenport essays, articles, introductions, and book reviews appeared while he was still an undergraduate; the last, just weeks before his death.  Davenport was a regular reviewer for ''[[National Review]]'' and ''[[The Hudson Review]]'', and, late in his life, at the invitation of [[John Jeremiah Sullivan]], he spent a year writing the "New Books" column for [[Harper's Magazine]]. His essays range from literary to social topics, from brief book reviews to lectures such as the title piece in his first collection of essays, ''The Geography of the Imagination''. His other collections of essays were ''Every Force Evolves a Form'' and ''The Hunter [[Gracchus]] and Other Papers on Literature and Art''.

He also published two slim volumes on art: ''A [[Balthus]] Notebook'' and ''Objects on a Table''. Although he wrote on many topics, Davenport, who never had a driver's license, was especially passionate about the destruction of American cities by the automobile.

Davenport published a handful of poems. The longest are the book-length ''Flowers and Leaves'', an intricate meditation on art and America, and "The Resurrection in [[Cookham]] Churchyard" (borrowing the title from a painting by [[Stanley Spencer]]). A selection of his poems and translations was published as ''[[Thasos]] and [[Ohio]]''.

Davenport translated ancient Greek texts, particularly from the [[Archaic period in Greece|archaic]] period. These were published in periodicals, then small volumes, and finally collected in ''7 Greeks''. He also translated the occasional other piece, including a few poems of [[Rainer Maria Rilke|Rilke]]'s, some [[ancient Egypt]]ian texts [after [[Boris de Rachewiltz]]], and, with [[Benjamin Urrutia]], the sayings of Jesus, published as ''The [[Logia]] of [[Yeshua (name)|Yeshua]]''.

==Visual art==
With his childhood newspaper, Davenport launched both his literary and artistic vocations. The former remained dormant or sporadic for some time while the latter, "making drawings, watercolors, and [[gouache]]s, [continued] throughout school, the army, and his early years as a teacher."<ref name="ReferenceA">Davenport, Guy. ''A Balance of Quinces''. New York: New Directions, 1996. 26.</ref> He drew or painted nearly every day of his life,<ref name="ReferenceA"/> and his notebooks contain drawings and pasted-in illustrations and photos cheek by jowl with his own observations and other writings and quotations from others.

From college forward, Davenport supplied cover art and decorations to literary periodicals.  He also supplied illustrations for others' books, notably two by [[Hugh Kenner]]: ''The Stoic Comedians'' (1962) and ''The Counterfeiters'' (1968).<ref>Heer, Jeet.  The Comics Journal #278,  October 2006. [http://sanseverything.wordpress.com/2008/01/30/guy-davenport-the-writer-as-cartoonist/ "Guy Davenport, Cartoonist"]</ref>   [[Image:Apples and pears Davenport.jpg|right|frame|The cover of ''Apples and Pears'' by Guy Davenport]]

As a visual artist (and childhood newspaper magnate) who also wrote, Davenport had a lifelong interest in printing and book design.  His poems and fictions were often first published in [[limited edition books|limited editions]] by small press craftsmen.<ref>Crane, Joan. ''Guy Davenport: A Descriptive Bibliography, 1947–1995''.  Haverford: Green Shade, 1996. 95,96.  (See also 24 unnumbered pages of drawings inserted between pages 184 and 185).</ref>

In 1965 Davenport and Laurence Scott prepared and printed Pound's Canto CX in an edition of 118 copies, 80 of which they presented to Pound for his 80th birthday. The previous year they had produced ''Ezra's Bowmen of [[Shu (state)|Shu]]'' on the same press, a double broadside that published for the first time, with a brief introductory essay by Davenport, a drawing by sculptor [[Henri Gaudier-Brzeska]] and a letter of Gaudier's from the trenches of World War I that cites Pound's poem (translated from one in the [[Shi Jing]]) "The Song of the Bowmen of Shu".<ref>[http://www.americanpoems.com/poets/ezrapound/16171 Song of the Bowmen of Shu – A poem by Ezra Pound – American Poems<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Many of Davenport's earlier stories are combinations of pictures and text, especially ''Tatlin!'' and ''Apples and Pears'' (where some of the illustrations are of pages that resemble those of his own notebooks).

"It was my intention, when I began writing fiction several years ago, to construct texts that were both written and drawn.... I continued this method right through ''Apples and Pears''...  The designer [of A+P] understood [my] collages to be gratuitous illustrations having nothing to do with anything, reduced them all to burnt toast, framed them with nonsensical lines, and sabotaged my whole enterprise. I took this as final defeat, and haven't tried to combine drawing and writing in any later work of fiction."<ref>''50 Drawings'' (Dim Gray Bar Press, 1996. Introduction.)</ref>

Davenport received a [[MacArthur Fellowship]] in 1990.
