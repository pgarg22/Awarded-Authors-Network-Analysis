His father, who had migrated to Ganja from Qom in north central Iran, may have been a civil servant; his mother was a daughter of a Kurdish chieftain; having lost both parents early in his life, Nizami was brought up by an uncle. He was married three times, and in his poems laments the death of each of his wives, as well as proferring advice to his son Muhammad. He lived in an age of both political instability and intense intellectual activity, which his poems reflect; but little is known about his life, his relations with his patrons, or the precise dates of his works, as the accounts of later biographers are colored by the many legends built up around the poet''}}</ref> or '''Nezāmi''', whose formal name was ''Jamal ad-Dīn Abū Muḥammad Ilyās ibn-Yūsuf ibn-Zakkī'',<ref name="moin">Mo'in, Muhammad(2006), "Tahlil-i Haft Paykar-i Nezami", Tehran.: p. 2: Some commentators have mentioned his name as “Ilyas the son of Yusuf the son of Zakki the son of Mua’yyad” while others have mentioned that Mu’ayyad is a title for Zakki.  Mohammad Moin, rejects the first interpretation claiming that if it were to mean 'Zakki son of Muayyad' it should have been read as 'Zakki i Muayyad' where izafe (-i-) shows the son-parent relationship but here it is 'Zakki Muayyad' and Zakki ends in silence/stop and there is no izafe (-i-). Some may argue that izafe is dropped due to meter constraints but dropping parenthood izafe is very strange and rare.

Excerpt: "In the Shahnama, Firdawsi already makes Iskandar  an exemplary figure, whom the companionship of Aristotle helps to rise still higher, by the path of wisdom and moderation, in the direction of abstinence and contempt for this world. And Firdwasi laid stress on the defeat of Dārā (the Darius of the Greeks) as something desired by "the rotation of the Heavens"....At the time of Niẓami, however, Islam is from then onwards well established in Iran, and it is the prophetic and ecumenical aspect of his destiny that the poet makes evident in his hero. As a learned Iranian poet, Niẓami, who demonstrates his eclecticism in the information he gives (he says, "I have taken from everything just what suited me and I have borrowed from recent histories, Christian, Pahlavi and Jewish ... and of them I have made a whole"), locates the story of his hero principally in Iran.

Moscow: Academkniga, 2003 ISBN 5-94628-118-6. excerpt:: "К этому времени отмеченные иранский и армянский факторы способствовали быстрой азербайджанизации исторических героев и исторических политических образований на территории Азербайджана. В частности, в 1938 г. Низами в связи с его 800-летним юбилеем был объявлен гениальным азербайджанским поэтом (История, 1939. С. 88–91). На самом деле он был персидским поэтом, что и неудивительно, так как городское население в те годы было представлено персами (Дьяконов, 1995. С. 731). В свое время это признавалось всеми энциклопедическими словарями, выходившими в России, и лишь Большая Советская Энциклопедия впервые в 1939 г. объявила Низами "великим азербайджанским поэтом" (Ср. Брокгауз и Ефрон, 1897. С. 58; Гранат, 1917. С. 195; БСЭ, 1939. С. 94). Translation from Russian: "By that time, already mentioned Iranian and Armenian factors contributed to the rapid azerbaijanization of historical heroes and historical political entities on the territory of Azerbaijan. In particular, in 1938, Nizami in connection with his 800-year anniversary was declared a genius (marvelous) Azerbaijani poet (History, 1939. pp. 88–91). In fact, he was a Persian poet, which is not surprising, because the urban population in those years was Persian (Dyakonov, 1995. page. 731). At one time it was recognized by all Encyclopedic Dictionaries of published in Russia, and only the Big Soviet Encyclopedia for the first time in 1939, announced Nizami as a "Great Azerbaijani poet" (Sr. Brockhaus and Efron, 1897. page. 58; Garnet, 1917. page. 195 ; BSE, 1939. p. 94)".-->

Excerpt: "The attempt to 'annex' an important part of Persian literature and to transform it into 'Azerbaidzhani literature' can be best exemplified by the way in which the memory of the great Persian poet Nizami (1141—1203) is exploited in the Soviet Union. The Soviet regime does not pay tribute to Nizami as a great representative of world literature, but is mainly interested in him as a ‘poet of the Soviet Union’, which he is considered to be because he was born in Gandzha in the territory of the present Azerbaidzhani Soviet Republic. The Soviet regime proclaims its ownership over Nizami also by ‘interpreting’ his works in accordance with the general pattern of Soviet ideology. Thus the leading Soviet journal Bolshevik stressed that Nizami's ‘great merit’ consisted in having undermined Islam by ‘opposing the theological teaching of the unchangeable character of the world’.  Stalin himself intervened in the dispute over Nizami and gave an authoritative verdict on the matter. In a talk with the Ukrainian writer, Mikola Bazhan, Stalin referred to Nizami as ‘the great poet of our brotherly Azerbaidzhani people’who must not be surrendered to Iranian literature, despite having written most of his poems in Persian."

===Family===
Nezami was married three times.  His first wife was a [[Kipchaks|Kipchak]] slave girl which was sent to him by Fakhr al-Din Bahramshah, the ruler of [[Derbent|Darband]], as part of a larger gift. According to Iraj Bashiri she became Nezami's "most beloved" wife. His only son ''Mohammad'' was from this wife. She died after "[[Khosrow and Shirin]]" was completed. Mohammad was seven at the time. Nezami mentions his son again in Layli and Majnun adding that now this son is 14 years old and "apple of my eyes". In "Haft Peykar" (Seven Beauties), he also mentions and advises his son about taking more responsibility as the father was growing more frail.

Some modern writers in the late 20th century have claimed that this wife was called ''Afaq''. Vahid Dastgerdi seems to be the first writer to propose this name for Nezami's first wife, but Said Nafisi (at the same time) and a recent source have challenged this interpretation of the corresponding verse in Nezami's work and the assumption that ''Afaq'' was the real name of his wife <ref>{{cite web |author=Siavash Lornejad, Ali Doostzadeh |title=On the Modern Politicization of the Persian Poet Nezami Ganjavi |publisher=Victoria Arakelova, YEREVAN SERIES FOR ORIENTAL STUDIES (Editor of the Series Garnik Asatrian), Caucasian Centre for Iranian Studies |location= Yerevan |year=2012 |pages= 173–175 |url=https://archive.org/download/OnTheModernPoliticizationOfThePersianPoetNezamiGanjavi_251/nezami_digital_version_final_2012.pdf }}</ref><ref name="archive1">{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/OnTheModernPoliticizationOfThePersianPoetNezamiGanjavi_251 |title=ON THE MODERN POLITICIZATION OF THE PERSIAN POET NEZAMI GANJAVI: Siavash Lornejad, Ali Doostzadeh: Free Download & Streaming: Internet Archive |date=2001-03-10 |access-date=2014-03-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140902001119/https://archive.org/details/OnTheModernPoliticizationOfThePersianPoetNezamiGanjavi_251 |archive-date=2014-09-02 |url-status=live }}</ref> and have taken the ''Afaq'' in that verse to simply mean "horizon" rather than a proper name.

==Education==
Nezami was not a philosopher<ref name="Nasr">Seyyed Hossein Nasr, Mehdi Amin Razavi, "The Islamic intellectual tradition in Persia", RoutledgeCurzon; annotated edition (July 4, 1996).  pp. 178–187</ref> in the sense of [[Avicenna]] or an expositor of theoretical Sufism in the sense of Ibn 'Arabi.  However, he is regarded as a philosopher<ref name="Nasr"/> and gnostic<ref name="Nasr"/> who mastered various fields of Islamic thoughts which he synthesized in a way that brings to mind the traditions of later Hakims such as [[Qutb al-Din Shirazi]].<ref name="Nasr"/>

Often referred to by the honorific Hakim ("the Sage"), Nezami is both a learned poet and master of a lyrical and sensuous style.  About Nezami's prodigious learning there is no doubt. Poets were expected to be well versed in many subjects; but Nezami seems to have been exceptionally so.  His poems show that not only he was fully acquainted with [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] literatures and with oral and written popular and local traditions, but was also familiar with such diverse fields as [[mathematics]], [[astronomy]],<ref name="Gelpke"/> [[astrology]],<ref name="Gelpke"/> [[alchemy]], [[medicine]], [[botany]], Koranic exegesis, [[Islamic]] theory and [[law]], [[Iranian Peoples|Iranian]] myths and legends,<ref>Maria Sutenly, "Visionary Rose: Metaphorical Application of Horticultural Practice in Persian Culture" in Michel Conan and W. John Kress, "Botanical progress, horticultural information and cultural changes", Dumbarton Oaks, 2007.  p. 12: "In a highly evocative tale he relates in the Makhzan al-Asrar ("Treasury of Secrets"), the twelfth-century Persian poet, Nizami whose oeuvre is an acknowledged repository of Iranian myths and legends, illustrates the way in which the rose was perceived in the Medieval Persian imagination"</ref> history, [[ethics]], [[philosophy]] and [[thought|esoteric thought]], music, and the [[visual arts]].<ref name="Oxford" />  His strong character, social sensibility, and knowledge of oral and written historical records, as well as his rich Persian<ref name="ChelkowskiMirror">Peter J.

p. 1: "The culture of Nizami's Persia is renowned for its deep-rooted tradition and splendor. In pre-Islamic times, it had developed extraordinarily rich and exact means of expression in music, architecture, and daily life as well as in writing, although Iran, its center—or, as the poets believed, its heart—was continually overrun by invading armies and immigrants, this tradition was able to absorb, transform, and ultimately ocercome foreign intrusion. Alexander the Great was only one of many conquerors, to be seduced by the Persian way of life."
p. 2:"During the last quarter of the twelfth century, when Nizami began his Khamsa, Seljuq supremacy was on the decline and political unrest and social ferments were increasing. However, Persian culture characteristically flourished when political power was diffused rather than centralized, and so Persian remained the primary language, Persian civil servants were in great demand, Persian merchants were successful, and princedoms continued to vie for the service of Persian poets. This was especially true in Ganjeh, the Caucasian outpost town where Nizami lived."
p. 6: "Nizami's strong character, his social sensibility, and his poetic genius fused with his rich Persian cultural heritage to create a new standard of literary achievement.  Using themes from the oral tradition and written historical records, his poems unite pre-Islamic and Islamic Iran", p. 9:"Probably no Persian writer has inspired succeeding generation of poets more than Nizami", p. 6: ""Khosrow and Shirin" proved to be a literary turning point not only for Nizami but for all of [[Persian poetry]].  Furthermore it was the first poem in Persian literature to achieve complete structural and artistic unity".  p. 2;"During the last quarter of the twelfth century, when Nizami began his Khamsa, Seljuq supremacy was on the decline and political unrest and social ferments were increasing. However, Persian culture characteristically flourished when political power was diffused rather than centralized, and so Persian remained the primary language, Persian civil servants were in great demand, Persian merchants were successful, and princedoms continued to vie for the service of Persian poets.

Because he was not a court poet and it was his poetry rather than his life or his political connections that won him enduring fame, he does not appear in the annals of the dynasties...".  p. 9: "The memorization and recitation of their literary heritage has alway beens vital to Iranians, whose attitude towards the power of the written and spoken word is revential. Even today the national passion for poetry is constantly expressed over radio and television, in teahouses, in literary societies, in daily conversation, and in the Musha'areh, the poetry recitation contest. Nizami's work serves as a vehicle and a symbol of this tradition, for it unites universality with deep-rooted artistic endeavor, a sense of justice and passion for the arts and sciences with spirituallity and genuine piety. for richness and fineness of metaphor, accuracy, and profundity of psychological observation, and sheer virtuosity of storytelling, Nizami is unequalled"</ref> cultural heritage unite pre-Islamic and Islamic Iran into the creation of a new standard of literary achievement.  Being a product of the Iranian<ref name="ChelkowskiEskandar"/> culture of the time, he not only created a bridge between pre-Islamic and Islamic Iran, but also between Iran<ref name="ChelkowskiEskandar"/> and the whole ancient world.

The recent discovery and publication of the anthology titled ''[[Nozhat al-Majales]]'' contains Persian language quatrains from Nizami and 115 other poets from the northwestern Iran (Arrān, Šarvān, Azerbaijan; including 24 poets from Ganja alone) during the same era.<ref name="Nozhat"/>  Unlike other parts of Persia,  where the poets mostly belonged to higher echelons of society such as scholars, bureaucrats, and secretaries, a good number of poets in the northwestern areas rose from among the common people with working-class backgrounds, and they frequently used colloquial expressions in their poetry.<ref name="Nozhat"/>  Accordingly, the book demonstrates the social conditions at the time, reflecting the full spread of Persian language and the culture in the region, which is evidenced by the common use of spoken idioms in poems and the professions of many of the poets.<ref name="Nozhat"/>  The influence of the northwestern Pahlavi language, for example, which had been the spoken dialect of the region, is clearly observed in the poems contained in this anthology.<ref name="Nozhat"/>  However, at the same time, the Caucasus region was entertaining a unique mixture of ethnic cultures.<ref name="Nozhat"/> [[Khaqani]]'s mother was a [[Nestorian Christian]], Mojir Baylqani's mother was an [[Armenians|Armenian]], and Nezami's mother was a [[Kurd]].<ref name="Nozhat"/> Their works reflect the cultural and linguistic diversity of the region.<ref name="Nozhat"/>

By the end of the 10th century,<ref name="ChelkowskiMirror"/> Persian literature became widespread from the eastern Mediterranean to the banks of the Indus.  The earliest extant example of Persian poetry from the area is that of [[Qatran Tabrizi]] (1009–1072) who served in the courts of the [[Shaddadid]] and [[Rawadid]] dynasties.

This school produced a distinctive style of poetry in Persian, which contrasted with "Khurasani" ("Eastern") style in its rhetorical sophistication, its innovative use of metaphor, its use of [[technical terminology]] and [[Christianity|Christian]] imagery, the presence of Persian<ref>Daniela Meneghini, “Saljuqs: Saljuqid Literature” in Encyclopedia Iranica. Excerpt:"The Saljuqs never governed the vast conquered territories as a centralized empire. The main power centers were Hamadān and Isfahan in the west, and Marv and Nišāpur (Nishapur) in the east, but their courts changed location several times over the decades. There were also branches of the Saljuq dynasty in Kermān, Syria, and in Anatolia, and the dynasty’s strong tendency towards decentralization led in the 12th century to the establishment of the atābak, or ‘parallel’ dynasties of Turkish slaves, put in government in some areas (Marāḡa, Tabriz, Shiraz, etc.) ‘external’ to the main centers of power. This phenomenon favored the development of a vigorous cultural life in cities such as Ray, Shiraz, and Yazd and especially in the urban centers of Azerbaijan and Arrān such as Tabriz and Šervān.” “With their capital, Šarvān (Šervān), in the lands of the eastern Caucasus, the Šarvānšāh dynasty also always maintained its independence from the Great Saljqus” “The geographical closeness of the territories subject to the Ildeguzids and those under the Šarvānšāh encouraged the flow of intellectuals and poets from one court to the other. It is also possible to speak of a certain similarity of inspiration and of style between the poets born and educated in these areas, to the point of defining them as belonging to the ‘Azerbaijan school’ (Rypka, Hist. Iran Lit., pp. 201–9). The complexity of the language and of the compositional techniques, the originality and multiplicity of the themes, the presence of Persian archaisms and, at the same time, a wide range of borrowings from Arabic vocabulary are among the stylistic features which are common to poets in this cultural context compared with other contemporaries closer to the Khorasani style.”</ref> archaism while borrowing from Arabic vocabulary, as well as new concepts.<ref name="Nozhat"/>  Other sources including the Encyclopaedia of Islam and traditional Iranian literary sources have used the term "'Iraqi" style for the Persian poetry of Nezami.<ref>De Bruijn, J.T.P.

The [[Seljuqs]] took control of [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]] from the [[Shaddadid]]s in 1075 and spread Persian literary westwards to their courts.  In the middle of the 12th century, the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk Empire']]s control of the region weakened and their provincial governors, virtually autonomous local princes, further encouraged Persian<ref name="ChelkowskiEskandar"/> culture, art and poetry in their courts. Persian culture characteristically flourished in this era, when political power was diffused and Persian remained the primary language, Persian civil servants and merchants were in great demand and rival dynasties continued to vie for the service of Persian poets.<ref name="ChelkowskiMirror"/>  This was especially true in Ganjeh, the Caucasian outpost town where Nizami lived.<ref name="ChelkowskiMirror"/>  Nezami was patronized by different rulers and dedicated his epics to various rival dynasties, including the [[Seljuqs]], [[Atabegs of Azerbaijan|Eldiguzids]] (who maintained control of Ganja during most of the later 12th century), [[Shirvanshah]]s, the ruler of Ahar and [[Ahmadilis]].  Although he enjoyed the patronage of various rulers and princes, he avoided the courts and is generally believed to have lived a secluded life. Since he was not a court poet, he does not appear in the annals of the dynasties, which list the names of events of the ruling families.<ref name="ChelkowskiMirror"/>

According to literary scholar Chelkowski, ''"''it seems that Nezami's favorite pastime was reading [[Ferdowsi|Firdawsi's]] monumental epic [[Shahnameh]] (The book of Kings).<ref name="ChelkowskiEskandar">(Chelkowski, P. "Nezami's Iskandarnameh:" in Colloquio sul poeta persiano Nizami e la leggenda iranica di Alessandro magno, Roma, 1977).
p. 10: "The Persian legend of Alexander the Great seems to overshadow all of the other fantastic Alexander stories not only in the tale of the successful accomplishment of many a "mission-impossible" but especially concerning the nature of his career.  In Iran he rose from the stature of a damned evil conqueror of the country, to that of a national Iranian hero king, and even more, to that of the great prophet of God, preparing all the nations for the true religion.  Yet the Persian legend of Alexander is very little known in the Western world."
p. 13: "Nizami was a typical product of the Iranian culture.  He created a bridge between Islamic Iran and pre-Islamic Iran and also between Iran and the whole ancient world.  His great humanism, strong character, sensibility, drama, colorful description of nature, rich language, and the poetic genius created a new standard of literary achievements and captured the imagination of countless imitators".
p. 17: "In the case of previous romances of Khosraw and Bahram, Nizami dealt with national Iranian heroes, though from pre-Islamic times.  In the tale of Layla and Majnun, the Arab nationality of the lover is of no importance since the story is based on a simple Arab folktale which was later absorbed and embellished by the Persians".
p. 19: "Alexander was glorified by the Muslims as a divine agent, a prophet-king and the blessed conqueror of the lands that were to become the stronghold of Islam.  To some Muslims, Islam was a realization of Alexander's "koine" --- a commonwealth where people could live in harmony and in peace of heart and mind.  In this atmosphere attempts were made to make out of Alexander not only a Muslim but a Persian as well".
p. 21: "However, it was not Tabari directly, but Ferdowsi who was Nizami's source of inspiration and material in composing Iskandarnameh. Nizami constantly alludes to the Shahnameh in his writing, especially in the prologue to the Iskandarnameh. It seems that he was always fascinated by the work of Firdawsi and made it a goal of his life to write an heroic epic of the same stature.
p. 22: "It seems that Nezami's favorite pastime was reading [[Ferdowsi|Firdawsi's]] monumental epic [[Shahnameh]] (The book of Kings)".
p. 22: "In fact, although Alexander conquered Iran, he was soon conquered by Persian customs and ways of life.  In many aspects he was so overwhelmed by Persian civilization that he became more Persian than the Persians.  He tried to make a blend of the Greek and Persian civilization --- even genetically, when he sponsored mass marriages between his troops and Persian women.  He himself married Roxane (Rowshanak) the daughter of the Sogdian prince – not the daughter of Darius the Third, as both Firdawsi and Nizami believed.  Like Alexander, Arabs, Turks, Mongols and other people who overran the Iranian plateau also came under the spell of Persian culture. Foreign invaders remained to become contributors and patrons of Persian art and culture. To give one example, some of Nizami's benefactors were of Turkic stock."</ref>  Nezami mentioned [[Ferdowsi]] as the Sage (Hakim) and Knower/Wise (daanaa) and the great master of discourse, "who has decorated words like new bride." Nezami advises the son of the [[Shirvanshah]] to read the Shah-nama and to remember the meaningful sayings of the wise.<ref>Dr. [[Ali Asghar Seyed Gohrab]]. "Layli and Majnun: Love, Madness and Mystic Longing", Brill Studies in Middle Eastern literature, Jun 2003. p. 276.</ref>  Nezami used the ''[[Shahnameh]]'' as a source in his three epics of ''[[Haft Peykar]], Khosrow and Shirin'' and ''Eskandar-Nameh''.<ref name="ChelkowskiEskandar"/>

The story of ''[[Vis and Ramin]]'' also had an immense influence on Nezami. Although Nezami takes the bases for most of his plots from [[Ferdowsi]], but the basis for his rhetoric comes from Gorgani.<ref name="DavisIranica">{{cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/vis-o-ramin |title=VIS O RĀMIN – Encyclopaedia Iranica |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date=2005-07-20 |access-date=2014-03-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221204951/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/vis-o-ramin |archive-date=2014-02-21 |url-status=live }}</ref> This is especially noticeable in ''Khosrow and Shirin'', which is of the same meter and imitates some scenes from ''Vis and Ramin''. Nezami's concern with astrology also has a precedent in an elaborate astrological description of the night sky in ''Vis and Ramin''. Nezami had a paramount influence on the romantic tradition, and Gorgani can be said to have initiated much of the distinctive rhetoric and poetic atmosphere of this tradition, with the absence of the [[Sufi]] influences, which are seen in Nezami's epic poetry.

The first monumental work of Nezami, the ''[[Makhzan al-Asrar]]'' is influenced by [[Sanai]]'s ''Hadikat al-Hakika''.<ref>

Nezami lived in an age of both political instability and intense intellectual activity, which his poems reflect; but little is known about his life, his relations with his patrons, or the precise dates of his works, as the many legends built up around the poet color the accounts of his later biographers. He dedicated his poems to various rulers of the region as was custom of that time for great poets, but avoided court life. Nezami was a master of the ''[[Masnavi]]'' style (double-rhymed verses). 

===The ''Khamsa'' or ''Panj Ganj''===
Nizami's main poetical work, for which he is best known, is a set of five long narrative poems known as the ''Khamsa'' ({{lang|fa|خمسه}}, 'Quintet or Quinary') or ''Panj Ganj'' ({{lang|fa|پنج گنج}}, 'Five Treasures'):
* ''Makhzan-ol-Asrâr'' ({{lang|fa|مخزن‌الاسرار}}, 'The Treasury or Storehouse of Mysteries'<ref name="IranicaClassical">CHARLES-HENRI DE FOUCHÉCOUR, "IRAN:Classical Persian Literature" in ''Encyclopædia Iranica''</ref>), 1163 (some date it 1176)
* ''Khosrow o Shirin'' ({{lang|fa|خسرو و شیرین}}, '[[Khosrow and Shirin]]'), 1177–1180
* ''Leyli o Majnun'' ({{lang|fa|لیلی و مجنون}}, '[[Layla and Majnun]]'), 1192
* ''Eskandar-Nâmeh'' ({{lang|fa|اسکندرنامه}}, 'The Book of Alexander'), 1194 or 1196–1202
* ''Haft Peykar'' ({{lang|fa|هفت پیکر}}, 'The Seven Beauties'), 1197

The first of these poems, ''Makhzan-ol-Asrâr'', was influenced by [[Sanai]]'s (d. 1131) monumental ''Garden of Truth''. The four other poems are medieval romances. Khosrow and Shirin, Bahram-e Gur, and [[Alexander the Great]], who all have episodes devoted to them in [[Ferdowsi]]'s ''[[Shahnameh]]'',<ref name="IranicaClassical"/> appear again here at the center of three of four of Nezami's narrative poems. The adventure of the paired lovers, Layla and Majnun, is the subject of the [[Layla and Majnun|second of his four romances]], and derived from Arabic sources.<ref name="IranicaClassical"/> In all these cases, Nezami reworked the material from his sources in a substantial way.<ref name="IranicaClassical"/>

The ''Khamsa'' was a popular subject for lavish manuscripts illustrated with painted miniatures at the Persian and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] courts in later centuries. Examples include the [[Khamsa of Nizami (British Library, Or. 12208)]], created for the Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]] in the 1590s.

====''Leyli o Majnun''====
A story of Arabic origin<ref name="IranicaLayla">{{cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/leyli-o-majnun-narrative-poem |title=LEYLI O MAJNUN – Encyclopaedia Iranica |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date=2009-07-15 |access-date=2014-03-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517062407/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/leyli-o-majnun-narrative-poem |archive-date=2014-05-17 |url-status=live }}</ref> which was later adapted and embellished by the Persians.<ref name="ChelkowskiEskandar"/>  The poem of 4,600 distichs was dedicated, in 1192, to Abu al-Muzaffar Shirvanshah, who claimed descent from the Sassanid King, whose exploits are reflected in Nezami's "Seven Beauties" (Haft Paykar).  The poem is based on the popular Arab legend of ill-starred lovers: the poet Qays falls in love with his cousin Layla, but is prevented from marrying her by Layla's father.  Layla's father forbids contact with Qays, so that Qays becomes obsessed and starts singing of his love for Layla in public. The obsession becomes so severe that he sees and evaluates everything in terms of Layla; hence his [[sobriquet]] "the possessed" (Majnun).<ref name="IranicaLayla"/>  Realizing that he cannot obtain union, even when other people intercede for him, he leaves society and roams naked in the desert among the beasts. However the image of Layla was so ingrained in him that he cannot eat or sleep. His only activity becomes composing poetry of longing for Layla.<ref name="IranicaLayla"/>  Meanwhile, Layla is married against her will, but she guards her virginity by resisting the advances of her husband. In a secret meeting with Majnun, they meet, but have no physical contact. Rather, they recite poetry to each other from a distance. Layla's husband dies eventually, which removes the legal obstacles to a licit union. However Majnun is so focused on the ideal picture of Layla in his mind, that he fled into the desert again. Layla dies out of grief and is buried in her bridal dress. Hearing this news, Majun rushes to her grave, where he instantly dies. They are buried side by side and their grave becomes a site of pilgrimage. Someone dreams that in Paradise they are united and live as a king and queen.<ref name="IranicaLayla"/> 

Nezami composed his romance at the request of the [[Shirvanshah]] Akhsatan. Initially, he doubted that this simple story about the agony and pain of an Arab boy wandering in rough mountains and burning deserts would be a suitable subject for royal court poetry and his cultured audience.<ref name="IranicaLayla" />  It was his son who persuaded him to undertake the project, saying: "wherever tales of love are read, this will add spice to them".<ref name="IranicaLayla" /> Nezami used many Arabic anecdotes in the story, but also adds a strong Persian flavor to the legend.<ref name="IranicaLayla" />

An important aspect of Layla and Majun is the poet's highly humanitarian approach. During the war by Nawfal in favor of Majnun, the latter is unhappy wishing the termination of the war. Majun gives away his horse and amours to save a gazelle and a stag.<ref>Ganjavi N. Tras. By Rogers, L. (2002). The Fire of Love: The Love Story of Layla and Majnun New Yorki: Writers Club Press, pp. 77-79.</ref>

Nezami gave a Persian character<ref name="Gelpke" /> to the poem by adding several techniques borrowed from the Persian epic tradition, such as the portrayal of characters, the relationship between characters, description of time and setting, etc.<ref>Ali Asghar Seyed-Gohrab, "Layli and Majnun: Madness and Mystic Longing" Brill Studies in Middle Eastern literature, Jun. 2003, pp. 76–77, excerpt: Although Majnun was to some extent a popular figure before Nizami's time, his popularity increased dramatically after the appearance of Nizami's romance. By collecting information from both secular and mystical sources about Majnun, Nizami portrayed such a vivid picture of this legendary lover that all subsequent poets were inspired by him, many of them imitated him and wrote their own versions of the romance. As we shall see in the following chapters, the poet uses various characteristics deriving from ‘Udhrite love poetry and weaves them into his own Persian culture. In other words, Nizami Persianises the poem by adding several techniques borrowed from the Persian epic tradition, such as the portrayal of characters, the relationship between characters, description of time and setting, etc.</ref> Further, he adapted the different stories about Majnun to fit a well-crafted Persian romantic epic.<ref name="EIslamLayla">[[Charles Pellat|Pellat, Ch.]]; Bruijn, J.T.P. de; Flemming, B.; Haywood, J.A.

Brill Online. Excerpts: "The theme was chosen for the first time as the subject of a Persian narrative poem, but the precedent of the treatment of a similar subject of Arabic origin existed in ʿAyyūḳī's Warḳa u Gulshāh.  Niẓāmī states in the introduction to his poem that he accepted the assignment with some hesitation. At first, he doubted whether this tale of madness and wanderings through the wilderness would be suitable for a royal court (ed. Moscow 1965, pp. 41 ff.).  He adapted the disconnected stories to fit the requirements of a Persian romance. ...In some respects, the Bedouin setting of the original has been changed under the influence of urban conditions more familiar to the poet and his audience: the young lovers become acquainted at school; the generous Nawfal is a prince in the Iranian style rather than an Arab official. Niẓāmī added a second pair of lovers, Zayn and Zaynab, in whom the love between the main characters is reflected. It is Zayn who in a dream sees Madjnūn and Laylī united in paradise at the end of the romance."</ref>

The [[Alexander Romance|Romance of Alexander the Great]] contains 10,500 distichs. There are differences of opinion on whether this or the ''Haft Paykar'' was Nezami's last epic.<ref name="HaftIranica"/>  The names of its dedicatees are uncertain, but the ruler of Ahar, Nosart al-Din Bishkin b. Mohammad has been mentioned.<ref name="eskandar"/> The story is based on Islamic myths developed about Alexander the Great, which derive from [[Qur'an]]ic references to the [[Dhu'l-Qarnayn]] as well as from the Greek Alexander romance of [[Pseudo-Callisthenes]]. It consists of two books, Sharaf-Nama and Iqbal-nameh. The poem narrates the three stages in Alexander's life: first as the conqueror of the world; then as a seeker after knowledge, gaining enough wisdom to acknowledge his own ignorance; and finally as a prophet, traveling once again across the world, from west to east, and south to north to proclaim his monotheistic creed to the world at large.<ref name="IranicaClassical"/>  The Sharaf-nama discusses the birth of Alexander, his succession to the throne of Rum (Greece), his wars against Africans who invaded Egypt, his conquest of Persia and his marriage to the daughter of Darius.  The episode also discusses Alexander's pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], his stay in the Caucasus and his visit to Queen Nushaba of Barda' and her court of Amazons.  Alexander conquers India, China and the land of the Rus.  The Sharafnama concludes with Alexander's unsuccessful search for the water of immortal life.<ref name="eskandar"/>

The Iqbal-nameh is a description of Alexander's personal growth into the ideal ruler on a model ultimately derived, through Islamic intermediaries, from [[Plato]]'s [[Republic]].<ref name="eskandar"/>  He has debates with Greek and Indian philosophers (c.f. with [[Asadi Tusi|Garshaspnama]]) and a major portion of the text is devoted to the discourses he has with seven Greek sages. The poet then tells of Alexander's end and adds an account of the circumstances of the death of each of the seven sages.<ref name="eskandar"/> Nezami's image of Alexander is that of an Iranian<ref name="EncyclopediaIslamEskandar">

Bosworth, E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2007. Brill online edition). Excerpt: "In the Shahnama, Firdawsi already makes Iskandar  an exemplary figure, whom the companionship of Aristotle helps to rise still higher, by the path of wisdom and moderation, in the direction of abstinence and contempt for this world. And Firdwasi laid stress on the defeat of Dārā (the Darius of the Greeks) as something desired by "the rotation of the Heavens"....At the time of Niẓami, however, Islam is from then onwards well established in Iran, and it is the prophetic and ecumenical aspect of his destiny that the poet makes evident in his hero. As a learned Iranian poet, Niẓami, who demonstrates his eclecticism in the information he gives (he says, "I have taken from everything just what suited me and I have borrowed from recent histories, Christian, Pahlavi and Jewish ... and of them I have made a whole"), locates the story of his hero principally in Iran.  He makes him the image of the Iranian "knight", peace-loving and moderate, courteous and always ready for any noble action. Like all Niẓami's heroes, he conquers the passions of the flesh, and devotes his attention to his undertakings and his friendships. These features appear in the account, which follows ancient tradition, of his conduct towards the women of the family of Darius, in his brotherly attitude on the death of that ruler, in his behaviour towards queen Nushaba (the Kaydaf of Firdawsi, the Kandake of the pseudo-Callisthenes) whom he defends against the Russians.</ref> knight.

{{main|Haft Peykar}}
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Practice Makes Perfect from a "Haft Paikar" of Nizami.jpg|thumbnail|left|''Practice Makes Perfect'' from a [[Haft Peykar]] of Nizami. [[Brooklyn Museum]].]]
A pre-Islamic story of Persian<ref name="ChelkowskiEskandar"/> origin, it was dedicated to the ruler of Maragha, 'Ala' Al-Din korp Arslan. It is the story of [[Bahram Gur|Bahram V]], the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] king, who is born to [[Yazdegerd I|Yazdegerd]] after twenty years of childlessness and supplication to [[Ahura Mazda]] for a child.  The Haft Peykar is a romanticized biography of the Sasanian Persian empire ruler [[Bahram Gur]].<ref name="HaftIranica"/>  His adventurous life had already been treated by [[Ferdowsi]] in the [[Shahnama]], to which fact Nezami alludes a number of times.<ref name="Oxford"/> In general, his method is to omit those episodes that the earlier poet had treated, or to touch on them only very briefly, and to concentrate on new material.<ref name="HaftIranica">{{cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/haft-peykar |title=HAFT PEYKAR – Encyclopaedia Iranica |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |access-date=2014-03-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140401191502/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/haft-peykar |archive-date=2014-04-01 |url-status=live }}</ref>  The poet starts by giving an account of the birth of [[Bahram Gur]] and his upbringing in the court of the Arab King No'man and his fabled palace Khwarnaq.  Bahram whose upbringing is entrusted to No'man becomes a formidable huntsman.  While wandering through the fabled palace, he discovers a locked room which contains a depiction of seven princesses; hence the name Haft Peykar (seven beauties).  Each of these princesses is from the seven different climes (traditional [[Zoroastrian]]-Islamic division of the Earth) and he falls in love with them.  His father [[Yazdegerd I]] passes away and [[Bahram Gur|Bahram]] returns to Persia to claim his throne from pretenders.  After some episodes he is recognized as King and rescues the Persians from a famine.  Once the country is stable, the King searches for the seven princesses and wins them as his brides.  His architect is ordered to construct seven domes for each of his new brides.  The architect tells him that each of the seven climes is ruled by one of the seven planets (classical planetary system of Zoroastrian-Islamic world) and advises him to assure good fortune by adorning each dome with the color that is associated with each clime and planet.  [[Bahram Gur|Bahram]] is skeptical but follows the advice of the architect.  The princesses take up residence in the splendid pavilions.  On each visit, the king visits the princesses on successive days of the week; on Saturday the Indian princess, who is governed by Saturn and so on.  The princesses names are Furak (Nurak), the daughter of the Rajah of India, as beautiful as the moon; Yaghma Naz, the daughter of the [[Khaqan]] of the Turks; Naz Pari, the daughter of the king of [[Chorasmia|Khwarazm]]; Nasrin Nush, the daughter of the king of the Slavs; Azarbin (Azareyon), the daughter of the king of Morocco; Humay, the daughter of the Roman Caesar; and Diroste (wholesome), a beautiful Iranian princess from the House of Kay Ka'us.  Each princess relates to the king a story matching the mood of her respective color.<ref name="HaftIranica"/>  These seven beautifully constructed, highly sensuous stories occupy about half of the whole poem.<ref name="HaftIranica"/>  While the king is busy with the seven brides, his evil minister seizes power in the realm.  [[Bahram Gur]] discovers that the affairs of Persia are in disarray, the treasury is empty and the neighboring rulers are posed to invade.  He clears his mind first by going hunting.  After returning from hunt, he sees a suspended dog from a tree.  The owner of the dog, who was shepherd, tells the story of how his faithful watchdog had betrayed his flock to a she-wolf in return for sexual favors.<ref name="HaftIranica"/>  He starts investigating the corrupt minister and from the multitude of complaints, he selects seven who tell him the injustice they have suffered.  The minister is subsequently put to death and [[Bahram Gur]] restores justice and orders the seven pleasure-domes to be converted to [[fire temple]]s<ref name="HaftIranica"/> for the pleasure of God. Bahram then goes hunting for the last time but mysteriously disappears.  As a pun on words, while trying to hunt the wild ass (''gūr'') he instead finds his tomb (''gūr'').<ref name="HaftIranica"/>

Ritter, in his introduction to the critical edition describes it as: "the best and most beautiful epic in New Persian poetry and at the same time [. . .] one of the most important poetical creations of the whole of oriental Indo-European literature".<ref name="HaftIranica"/> The Haft Peykar is considered the poet's masterpiece.<ref name="Oxford"/> Overall, Nezami illustrates the harmony of the universe, the affinity of the sacred and the profane, and the concordance of ancient and Islamic Iran.<ref name="EncyclopediaIslam"/>

The story was translated to English in 1924 by Charles Edward Wilson.<ref>The Haft paikar [Engl.], Wilson, Charles Edward, London: Probsthain. 1924.

The evil-natured man keeps faith with none; the erring nature does not fail to err.
The scorpion since it is by nature bad—to let it live's a fault, to kill it, good.
Seek knowledge, for through knowledge you effect that doors to you be opened and not closed.

Only a small corpus of his Persian lyric poetry, mainly [[Qasida|qaṣīdahs]] ("odes") and [[ghazals]] ("lyrics") have survived.

A famous [[ghazal]] of Nezami talks about [[altruism]] as the path for reaching the ultimate spiritual goal:

{{cquote|
I went to the Tavern last night, but I was not admitted<br />
I was bellowing yet nobody was listening to me<br />
Either none of the wine-sellers were awake<br />
Or I was a nobody, and no one opened the door for a Nobody<br />
When more or less half of the night had passed<br />
A shrewd, perfect man (rind) raised his head from a booth and showed his face<br />
I asked him: “to open the door”, he told me: “go away, do not talk nonsense!<br />
At this hour, nobody opens door for anybody<br />
This is not a mosque where its doors are open any moment<br />
Where you can come late and move quickly to the first row<br />
This is the Tavern of Magians and rinds dwell here<br />
There are Beauties, candle, wine, sugar, reed flute and songs<br />
Whatever wonders that exists, is present here<br />
(in this tavern there are) Muslims, Armenians, Zoroastrian, Nestorians, and Jews<br />
If you are seeking company of all that is found here<br />
You must become a dust upon the feet of everyone in order to reach your (spiritual perfection) goal”<br />
O Nezami! if you knock the ring on this door day and night<br />

Amongst the many notable poets who have taken the ''Five Treasures'' of Nezami as their model may be mentioned [[Amir Khusro]], Jalal Farahani, [[Khwaju Kermani]], Mohammad Katebi Tarr-Shirini, Abdul Rahman [[Jami]], Hatefi Jami, [[Vahshi Bafqi]], Maktabi Shirazi, [[Ali-Shir Nava'i]], [[Abdul-Qader Bedil|Abdul Qader-e Bedel Dehlavi]], [[Fuzûlî]], Hashemi Kermani, Fayzi, Jamali<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kamsa-ye-jamali |title=ḴAMSA-ye JAMĀLI – Encyclopaedia Iranica |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |access-date=2014-03-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323194334/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kamsa-ye-jamali |archive-date=2014-03-23 |url-status=live }}</ref> and [[Ahmad Khani]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}  Not only poets, but also historians such as Rawandi were influenced by Nezami's poetry and used his poems as a source for rendering history.  Besides these, scores of poets have started their composition with the first line of the ''Makhzan al-Asrar''.

According to Rudolf Gelpke, "Many later poets have imitated Nizami's work, even if they could not equal and certainly not surpass it; Persians, Turks, Indians, to name only the most important ones. The Persian scholar Hekmat has listed not less than forty Persian and thirteen Turkish versions of ''Layli and Majnun''."<ref name="Gelpke"/>

According to Vahid Dastgerdi, "If one would search all existing libraries, one would probably find more than 1000 versions of ''Layla and Majnun''."

[[Jami]] in his Nafahatol Ons remarks that: "Although most of Nezami's work on the surface appear to be romance, in reality they are a mask for the essential truths and for the explanation of divine knowledge."

Jami in his Baharestan mentions that "Nezami's excellence is more manifest than the sun and has no need of description.  Hashemi of Kerman remarks: The empire of poetry obtained its law and order from Nezami's beautiful verses and To present words before Nezami's silent speech is a waste of time."

[[Amir Khusro]] writes:<br />
"The ruler of the kingdom of words, famed hero,<br />
Scholar and poet, his goblet [glass] toasts.<br />
In it – pure wine, it's drunkingly sweet,<br />
Yet in goblet [glass] beside us – only muddy setting."

German poet and writer [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] wrote: "A gentle, highly gifted spirit, who, when [[Ferdowsi]] had completed the collected heroic traditions, chose for the material of his poems the sweetest encounters of the deepest love. ''Majnun and Layli'', ''Khosrow and Shirin'', lovers he presented; meant for one another by premonition, destiny, nature, habit, inclination, passion staunchly devoted to each other; but divided by mad ideas, stubbornness, chance, necessity, and force, then miraculously reunited, yet in the end again in one way or another torn apart and separated from each other."{{Citation needed|date=August 2021}}

With regards to the recitation of his poetry, Peter Chelkowski states: "The memorization and recitation of their literary heritage has alway beens vital to Iranians, whose attitude towards the power of the written and spoken word is revential. Even today the national passion for poetry is constantly expressed over radio and television, in teahouses, in literary societies, in daily conversation, and in the ''Musha'areh'', the poetry recitation contest. Nizami's work serves as a vehicle and a symbol of this tradition, for it unites universality with deep-rooted artistic endeavor, a sense of justice and passion for the arts and sciences with spirituallity and genuine piety. For richness and fineness of metaphor, accuracy, and profundity of psychological observation, and sheer virtuosity of storytelling, Nizami is unequalled".<ref name="ChelkowskiMirror"/>

Nezami's story of ''Layla and Majnun'' also provided the namesake for a hit single by [[Eric Clapton]], also called "[[Layla (song)|Layla]]". Recorded with the group [[Derek and the Dominos]], the song was released on the 1970 album ''[[Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs]]''. The album was influenced by Nezami and his poetry of unrequited love. The fifth song of the album, "I Am Yours", was based on a poem by Nezami, set to music by Clapton.{{Citation needed|date=August 2021}}

In 2004, there was a conference on Nezami organized at the [[University of Cambridge]]. The proceedings of this conference were published under the title ''Nizami: A Key to the Treasure of Hakim'' in 2011.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Johan Christoph |last1=Burgel |first2=Christine |last2=van Ruyuymbeke |title=Nizami: A Key to the Treasure of the Hakim |publisher= Amsterdam University Press |year=2011 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=z5YccgAACAAJ }} }}</ref>

{{main|Campaign on granting Nizami the status of the national poet of Azerbaijan}}
In the early 1940s and to mark the 800th anniversary of Nizami Ganjavi, [[Music of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani]] composer [[Uzeyir Hajibeyov]] planned to write seven songs based on Nizami's poem about the ''Seven Beauties''. However Hajibeyov wrote only two songs: ''Sensiz'' (Without You, 1941) and ''Sevgili Janan'' (Beloved, 1943). Another Azerbaijani composer [[Gara Garayev]], composed [[Seven Beauties (ballet)]] in 1947–48 based on Nizami's eponymous poem that won an international acclaim.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kara Karayev (Azerbaijani composer) - Encyclopædia Britannica|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/312208/Kara-Karayev%20Kara%20Karayev%20(Azerbaijani%20composer).%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopedia|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323194422/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/312208/Kara-Karayev%20Kara%20Karayev%20(Azerbaijani%20composer).%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopedia|archive-date=2014-03-23|access-date=2014-03-23|publisher=Britannica.com}}</ref> He also composed [[Leyli and Majnun (ballet)]] that premiered on 25 May 1969 at the [[Azerbaijan State Academic Opera and Ballet Theater]] in [[Baku]] and later was recorded as a film.<ref>Tatiana Egorova ''Soviet Film Music: An Historical Survey'', p. 186</ref>  

A [[minor planet]], called [[3770 Nizami]], was discovered by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] astronomer [[Lyudmila Chernykh]] in 1974 and named after him. Further, the [[Nizami Museum of Azerbaijan Literature|Museum of Azerbaijan literature]] in Baku is named after Nizami.
