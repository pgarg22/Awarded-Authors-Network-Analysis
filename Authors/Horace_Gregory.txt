Gregory's poetry has been described as "literary" and "exhibit[ing] an awareness of the lives of working people, sometimes taking the form of the elegiac monologue."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/horace-gregory|title=Horace Gregory|last=Foundation|first=Poetry|date=2018-12-28|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en|access-date=2018-12-28}}</ref> Poet Richard Eberhart said: “The ruthlessness of the city used to be his interest; he used to depict realistic characters and situations within it. Now there is the general serenity, poise and lyrical concern with language.” He added: “Gregory is lyrical and straight-forward in these poems.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/horace-gregory|title=Horace Gregory|last=Foundation|first=Poetry|date=2018-12-28|website=Poetry Foundation|language=en|access-date=2018-12-28}}</ref> [https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/29/obituaries/edgar-johnson-93-biographer-of-dickens-and-scott-is-dead.html Edgar Johnson], biographer of Dickens and Sir Walter Scott among others, said that "Mr. Gregory is not one of those scholar-critics who write only for other scholar-critics.
