'''Frank Garvin Yerby''' ({{Birth date|1916|09|05}} – {{death date|1991|11|29}}) was an American writer, best known for his 1946 historical novel ''The Foxes of Harrow''.<ref name=Frazier>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Frazier |first=Valerie |encyclopedia=New Georgia Encyclopedia |title=Frank Yerby (1916–1991) |url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/arts-culture/frank-yerby-1916-1991 |access-date=January 20, 2017 |date=July 16, 2002 }}</ref>

==Early life==
Yerby was born in [[Augusta, Georgia]], on September 5, 1916, the second of four children{{citation needed|date=July 2021}} of Rufus Garvin Yerby (1886–1961) and Wilhelmina Ethel Yerby (née Smythe) (1888–1960). Rufus, a hotel doorman, was part African-American, part [[Seminole]]; Wilhelmina ("Willie") was Scots-Irish.<ref name=Frazier/> Yerby would later refer to himself as "a young man whose list of ancestors read like a mini-United Nations."<ref>{{cite news |last=Folkart |first=Burt A. |date=January 9, 1992 |title=Frank Yerby; Novelist Felt Rejected by His Native South |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-01-09/news/mn-2134_1_frank-yerby |newspaper=The Los Angeles Times |access-date=January 20, 2017}}</ref> One of Yerby's siblings was [[Alonzo Smythe Yerby|Alonzo Yerby]], Associate Dean of the [[Harvard School of Public Health]] in Boston and New York City Hospitals Commissioner.

As a child, Yerby attended Augusta's Haines Institute, a private school for African Americans.<ref name="OxAm"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/frank-yerby-was-award-winning-novelist |title=Frank Yerby Was an Award Winning Novelist |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=African American Registry |access-date=January 20, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202001349/http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/frank-yerby-was-award-winning-novelist |archive-date=February 2, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 1937, he graduated from [[Paine College]] with a B.A. in English, and earned his M.A. from [[Fisk University]] in 1938,<ref name=Frazier/> where he published his first poetry, in the ''Fisk Herald'', "The Fishes and the Poet's Hands", "a curious poem [that] might be read as a lament that a fascination with the Romantic and picturesque would be at odds with penning protest literature", according to [[Hollis Robbins]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.bestamericanpoetry.com/the_best_american_poetry/2019/03/frank-yerby-protest-and-the-picturesque-by-hollis-robbins.html |author-link=Hollis Robbins |first=Hollis |last=Robbins |title=Frank Yerby, Protest, and the Picturesque [by Hollis Robbins] |date=March 21, 2019 |access-date=September 5, 2019 |publisher=Best American Poetry}}</ref>

In 1939, he began courses for his doctorate in education at the [[University of Chicago]], but left school to teach.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Lyon |first=Bill |date=March 30, 1981 |title=Expatriate Writer Frank Yerby Is Grousing Even Though His 30th Best-Seller Is Coming Up |url=http://people.com/archive/expatriate-writer-frank-yerby-is-grousing-even-though-his-30th-best-seller-is-coming-up-vol-15-no-12/ |magazine=People |access-date=January 20, 2017}}</ref> He was a professor of English at [[Florida A&M University]] and then [[Southern University]] in Louisiana, before moving to Detroit and New York, where he worked in wartime defense industries.<ref name="OxAm"/>

==Novelist==

Yerby was originally noted for writing romance novels set in the [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] South.<ref name="OxAm"/> In mid-century, he began writing a series of best-selling historical novels ranging from the [[Athens]] of [[Pericles]] to Europe in the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]. Yerby took considerable pains in research and often end-noted his historical works. In all, he wrote 33 novels.

His 1944 short story "Health Card", published in ''[[Harper's]]'', won the prestigious [[O. Henry Award|O. Henry Memorial Prize]] for best short story.<ref name="OxAm" /><ref name="EB" />

In 1946, he published ''The Foxes of Harrow'', a Southern historical romance, which became the first novel by an African American to sell more than a million copies. In this work he faithfully reproduced many of the genre's most familiar features, with the notable exception of his representation of African-American characters, who bore little resemblance to the "happy darkies" that appeared in such well-known works as ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone With the Wind]]'' (1936). That same year he also became the first African American to have a book purchased for screen adaptation by a Hollywood studio, when [[20th Century Fox]] optioned ''Foxes''. Ultimately, the book became a 1947 [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-nominated [[The Foxes of Harrow|film of the same name]] starring [[Rex Harrison]] and [[Maureen O'Hara]].

In some quarters, Yerby is best known for his masterpiece ''The Dahomean'' (1971).<ref name="EB"/> The novel, which focuses on the life of an enslaved African chief's son who is transported to America, serves as the culmination of Yerby's efforts toward incorporating racial themes into his works. Prior to that, Yerby was often criticized by blacks for the lack of focus on African-American characters in his books.<ref name="georgiaencyclopedia.org">{{cite news|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-523  |title=Frank Yerby |work=New Georgia Encyclopedia}}</ref><ref name="EB"/>

In 2012, ''[[The New York Times]]'' columnist [[Nicholas Kristof]] wrote an article featuring an at-risk child whose life was turned around by reading Yerby books that one of his teachers was secretly providing to him.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/opinion/sunday/kristof-how-mrs-grady-transformed-olly-neal.html  |title=How Mrs. Grady Transformed Olly Neal|author=Kristof, Nicholas D. |work=The New York Times|date= January 21, 2012}}</ref>

==Later years and death==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}
Yerby left the United States in 1952, in protest against racial discrimination, and moved to [[Nice]], France, for three years. In 1955 he moved to [[Madrid]], Spain (with his second wife, Blanca, a native Spaniard), where he remained for the rest of his life.<ref name="OxAm"/><ref name="EB">{{cite web |title=Frank Yerby |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Frank-Yerby |website=Encyclopaedia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica |access-date= March 22, 2020 |archive-date= September 1, 2019}}</ref> Yerby died from liver cancer in Madrid and was interred there in the [[Cementerio de la Almudena]], a Protestant cemetery.

He had four children – Jacques, Nikki, Faune, and Jan Keith – with his first wife, Flora.<ref name="OxAm"/>

==Posthumous honors==
In 2006, Yerby was posthumously inducted into the Georgia Writers Hall of Fame.<ref name="georgiaencyclopedia.org"/>
