'''Mohammad Raushan Yazdani''' ({{lang-bn|মোহাম্মদ রওশন ইজদানী}}) was a Bengali author and researcher of folk literature.<ref name="bpedia">{{cite Banglapedia|article=Yazdani, Mohammad Raushan|author=[[Wakil Ahmed]]}}</ref> As a folklorist, his work was crucial due to his discoveries of tales and poems from the remotest villages of eastern Bengal (now [[Bangladesh]]).<ref>{{cite journal|journal=The Cultural Scene in Pakistan: Literature|year=1961|volume=2|title=Rawshan Yazdani}}</ref> His most celebrated work is Momenshahir Loka-Sahitya dedicated to folk literature in Momenshahi ([[Mymensingh Division|Mymensingh]])<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Polman |first1=Horace I. |last2=Hobbs |first2=Cecil |last3=Rony |first3=Abdul |date=April 1964 |title=South and Southeast Asia |journal=The Quarterly Journal of the Library of Congress |volume=21 |issue=2 |page=161 |jstor=29781119}}</ref> Yazdani was one of the most popular Bengali poets in the [[Pakistan]] period.<ref>{{cite Banglapedia|article=Bangla Literature|author1=Mohammad Daniul Huq|author2=[[Aminur Rahman]]}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Yazdani was born in the village of Bidyaballabh, [[Kendua Upazila|Kendua]] in the District of Mymensingh (now in [[Netrokona District]]) on 27 February 1918. His father, Shaykh Ali Kabir, was a practitioner of [[alternative medicine]]. After completing primary education at a local Old Scheme [[madrasa]], Yazdani studied in Ashujia High School until class 10. Around this time at the age of 18, his mother died and Yazdani became negligent of his education and started accompanying syncretic mystics. Yazdani eventually left these mystics, returning to orthodox [[Sunni Islam]] after marrying Zubaydah Akhtar Khatun, a [[Bengali Muslim]] woman with whom he started a family.

==Career==

Yazdani had took on multiple career paths throughout his life. He started working as a primary school teacher at a village in 1940. Shortly afterwards, he became a clerk of the Debt Settlement Board. He later began his career in grade one [[proofreading]] for Franklin Publications in 1956 as well as [[The Azad]]. He left his job as a proofreader in 1959 due to ill health and returned to his village home and devoted himself to literary pursuits. He was inspired by the likes of [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]] and [[Jasimuddin]] as well as the rich [[puthi]] literature ([[Dobhashi]] poetry) of Bengal. His poetry focused much on the glory of [[Muslims]] as well as village life.<ref>{{cite Banglapedia|article=Poetry|author=Hakim Arif}}</ref> Poems about the latter include Chinu Bibi and Rongila Bondhu. Some of his poems were about rebellion like Bojrobani.<ref>{{cite book|title=Indian Books|volume=5|year=1972|publisher=Mukherji Book House}}</ref>

With a growing hobby of collecting [[Bengali language]] folk literature, Yazdani became known as a folklorist. He started writing up essays on folk literature which were published in popular journals and newspapers. He was awarded the [[Adamjee Literary Award]] by the [[President of Pakistan]] [[Ayub Khan (general)|Ayub Khan]] in 1959.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/595871 |title=Adamjee award for Abbas, Shaukat |date=2011-01-03 |work=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|location=[[Karachi]], [[Pakistan]]|access-date=2019-05-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.aikrozan.com/%D9%BE%D8%A7%DA%A9%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%B3%D9%88%D9%84-%D8%A7%DB%8C%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B1%DA%88%D8%B2%D8%A7%DA%A9-%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B4%D8%A7-%D8%B3%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D8%B3-%D8%B1%DB%81%D8%A7-%DB%81/|script-title=ur:پاکستان سول ایوارڈز:اک تماشا سا بس رہا ہے میاں!|language=ur|author=Shehzad, Ghafir|date=8 Oct 2016|website=Aik Rozan}}</ref> This was for writing Khatamun Nabiyyeen (Seal of the Prophets), a biographical poem on [[Muhammad]], the final [[Islamic prophet]] in verse.<ref>{{cite book|page=113|title=Creativity, Reality, and Identity|author=Anisuzzaman|year=1993|publisher=International Centre for Bengal Studies}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|language=ur|script-title=ur:پاکستان میں اول اول: انسائیکلوپیڈیا|author=Zahid Husain Anjum|page=33|chapter=Bengali|year=1992|publisher=Maktabah-yi Taʻmīr-i Insāniyyat}}</ref> This poem was later translated to English as ''The Word of God''.
