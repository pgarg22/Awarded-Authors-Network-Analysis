'''Charles Bernard Spencer''' (1909 &ndash; 1963) was an English poet, translator, and editor.

He was born in [[Madras]], [[India]] and educated at [[Marlborough College]] and [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]]. At Marlborough he knew [[John Betjeman]] and [[Louis MacNeice]]; at [[Oxford]] [[Stephen Spender]], and he also came across [[W. H. Auden]]. He edited ''Oxford Poetry'' in 1930-1931. He was not, however, drawn far into what was soon known as the [[Auden Group]]; he is identified much more with the type of poetry later exemplified by [[Lawrence Durrell]], and is for some critics the stand-out in the [[Cairo poets]]. His potential was never quite fulfilled, partly because of poor health.

After graduation, he made a living from teaching and writing, marrying the actress Norah Gibbs in 1936. At that time he was collaborating on [[Geoffrey Grigson]]'s ''New Verse''. In [[World War II]] he worked for the [[British Council]], in [[Greece]] and then [[Egypt]]. There he edited the ''Personal Landscape'' magazine.

After the war he continued to work for the [[British Council]], being posted to [[Italy]]. Norah died in 1947, of [[tuberculosis]]. He himself was ill for a time. Through other postings he wrote little.

He was married again in 1961, to Anne Marjoribanks. He died in [[Vienna]], apparently in an accident, while once more in bad health.

A conference on Spencer's life and work was held at the University of Reading in October 2009, with an exhibition of manuscripts and other personal effects.<ref>The Bernard Spencer Conference, [[University of Reading]], October 2009</ref> His ''Complete Poetry, Translations and Selected Prose'' edited by [[Peter Robinson (poet)|Peter Robinson]] was published by [[Bloodaxe Books]] in February 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bloodaxebooks.com/personpage.asp?author=Bernard+Spencer |title=Author Page > Bernard Spencer |publisher=Bloodaxe Books |date=1963-09-11 |accessdate=2014-02-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222174118/http://www.bloodaxebooks.com/personpage.asp?author=Bernard+Spencer |archivedate=2014-02-22 }}</ref>
