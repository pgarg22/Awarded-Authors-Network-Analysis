'''Anne Perry''' (born '''Juliet Marion Hulme'''; 28 October 1938) is an English author of [[historical mystery|historical detective fiction]], best known for her [[Thomas Pitt (character)|Thomas Pitt]] and [[William Monk]] series.  In 1954, at the age of fifteen, she was convicted in the [[Parker–Hulme murder case|murder of her friend's mother, Honora Rieper]]. She changed her name after serving a five-year sentence for Rieper's murder.

==Early life==
Born in [[Blackheath, London]], the daughter of [[physics|physicist]] [[Henry Rainsford Hulme|Dr. Henry Rainsford Hulme]], Perry was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]] as a child and sent to the [[Caribbean]] and South Africa in hopes that a warmer climate would improve her health. A 1948 ''Auckland Star'' photograph of Juliet arriving in New Zealand was discovered by Auckland Libraries staff and written about in the Heritage et AL blog.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://heritageetal.blogspot.co.nz/2012/06/juliet-hulme.html |title=Juliet Hulme |last1=Graves |first1=Joanne |date=29 June 2012 |website=heritageetal.blogspot.co.nz |publisher=[[Blogger (service)|Blogger]] |access-date=23 August 2015 |quote=Whilst scrolling through microfilms on a job for a customer, I came across an interesting photo in a 1948 copy of the Auckland Star.}}</ref> She rejoined her family when she was 13 after her father took a position as [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] of [[Canterbury University College]] in New Zealand. She attended [[Christchurch Girls' High School]], located in what became the [[Cranmer Centre]].<ref name="NZ History">{{cite web|title=Pauline Parker|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/people/pauline-parker|publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]]|access-date=20 May 2011|date=22 June 2010}}</ref>

==Murder and trial==
{{main|Parker–Hulme murder case}}
In June 1954, at the age of 15, Hulme and her best friend [[Pauline Parker]] murdered Parker's mother, Honorah Rieper.<ref>Honora used the surname Rieper although she was never legally married to Herbert Rieper.</ref> Hulme's parents were in the process of separating and she was supposed to go to South Africa to stay with a relative. The two teenage friends, who had created a complicated [[fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]] life together populated with famous actors such as [[James Mason]] and [[Orson Welles]], did not want to be separated.

On 22 June 1954, the girls and Honorah Rieper went for a walk in Victoria Park in their hometown of [[Christchurch]]. On an isolated path Hulme dropped an ornamental stone so that Rieper would lean over to retrieve it. Parker had planned to hit her mother with half a brick wrapped in a stocking. The girls presumed that one blow would kill her but it took more than 20.<ref>{{cite web

Parker and Hulme stood trial in Christchurch in 1954 and were found guilty on 29 August that year. As they were too young to be considered for the [[death penalty]] under New Zealand law at the time, they were convicted and sentenced to be "detained [[at Her Majesty's pleasure]]". In practice they were detained at the discretion of the Minister of Justice. They were released separately five years later.

Parker and Hulme are not believed to have had any contact since the trial.<ref name="Herald interview">{{cite news |url= https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10371147|title=We were not lesbians, says former Juliet Hulme|date=5 March 2006|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| access-date = 21 May 2011}}</ref>

The events formed the basis for the 1994 film ''[[Heavenly Creatures]]'', in which [[Melanie Lynskey]] portrayed a teenage Pauline Parker and [[Kate Winslet]] the teenaged Juliet Hulme.  At the time of the film's release, it was not generally known that  [[mystery author]] "Anne Perry" was Juliet Hulme, whose identity was made public some months after the film's release. Although some presumed Hulme and Parker's relationship to be sexual, Perry stated in 2006 that, while the relationship was obsessive, the two "were never lesbians".<ref name="Herald interview"></ref>

==Later life==
After being released from prison in November 1959, Hulme returned to England and became a [[flight attendant]]. For a period she lived in the United States, where she joined [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] in 1968. She later settled in the Scottish village of [[Portmahomack]] where she lived with her mother. Her father had a distinguished scientific career, heading the British [[hydrogen bomb]] programme.<ref>{{cite journal | bibcode = 1991QJRAS..32..313T | title=Henry Rainsford Hulme, 9 August 1908 – 8 January 1991. | journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society | volume=32 | page=313 | year=1991 | authors=Tayler, R. J.| issue=3 }}</ref>

Hulme took the name Anne Perry, using her stepfather's surname. Her first novel, ''[[The Cater Street Hangman]]'', was published under this name in 1979. Her works generally fall into one of several categories of [[genre fiction]], including historical murder mysteries and [[detective fiction]]. Many feature [[recurring character]]s, most importantly [[Thomas Pitt (fictional character)|Thomas Pitt]], who appeared in her first novel, and amnesiac private investigator [[William Monk]], who first appeared in her 1990 novel ''The Face of a Stranger''. By 2003 she had published 47 novels, and several collections of short stories.  Her story "Heroes", which first appeared in the 1999 anthology ''Murder and Obsession'', edited by [[Otto Penzler]], won the 2001 [[Edgar Award]] for Best Short Story.

In 2005, Perry appeared on the ''[[Trisha Goddard (TV Series)|Trisha]]'' show to discuss the crime on a special themed show.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/817932 |title=Film & TV Database |access-date=25 March 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021200446/http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/817932 |archive-date=21 October 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> A 2009 documentary film, ''Anne Perry Interiors'', gave a snapshot of her life and the people close to her.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1403119/ IMDb]</ref>

In 2017, Anne Perry left Scotland and moved to Hollywood in order to more effectively promote films based on her novels.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Kiwi killer Anne Perry leaves Scotland hideaway for Hollywood |date=5 June 2017 |newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]]  |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11869811 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707143747/http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11869811 |archive-date=7 July 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy}}</ref>

==Bibliography==
Each series is listed in internal chronological order, according to the author's website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anneperry.net/booklist/6 |title=Pitt |publisher=anneperry.net |access-date=2013-02-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117180234/http://www.anneperry.net/booklist/6 |archive-date=2013-01-17 }}</ref>

The two main series each feature a male and a female protagonist. Thomas Pitt is matched with Charlotte; her female society relatives help in the mysteries out of boredom. William Monk is matched with Hester Latterly, a Crimean War nurse. The Monk mysteries are set earlier in the Victorian era (1850s–1860s) than the Pitt books (1880s–1890s). Hester plays a very strong role in these stories; in some cases she is a better investigator than Monk. The Christmas stories involve minor characters such as sisters, bosses, or grandmothers in a personal crisis at a later Christmas time with a strongly enforced redemption message at the end.
