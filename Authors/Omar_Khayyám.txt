There is a tradition of attributing [[Persian poetry|poetry]] to Omar Khayyam, written in the form of [[quatrain]]s (''[[Rubaʿi|rubāʿiyāt]]'' {{lang|fa|رباعیات|rtl=yes}}). This poetry became widely known to the English-reading world in a translation by [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward FitzGerald]] (''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]'', 1859), which enjoyed great success in the [[Orientalism]] of the [[fin de siècle]].

==Life==
Omar Khayyam was born in 1048 in [[Nishapur]], a leading metropolis in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] during medieval times that reached its zenith of prosperity in the eleventh century under the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuq dynasty]].<ref name = "Sarton">"The Tomb of Omar Khayyâm", George Sarton, ''Isis'', Vol. 29, No. 1 (Jul. 1938), 15.</ref>{{rp|15}}<ref name = "FitzGerald">Edward FitzGerald, ''Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam'', Ed. Christopher Decker, (University of Virginia Press, 1997), xv; "The Seljuq Turks had invaded the province of Khorasan in the 1030s, and the city of Nishapur surrendered to them voluntarily in 1038.

(E. D. R., & H. A. R. G. (1929:436).</ref>
In medieval Persian texts he is usually simply called ''Omar Khayyam''.<ref>Frye (1975:658); e.g. in [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]] (Browne 1899:409f) or in ''Munis al-ahrar'' (Ross 1927:436).</ref> Although open to doubt, it has often been assumed that his forebears followed the trade of tent-making, since ''Khayyam'' means ''tent-maker'' in Arabic.<ref name = "Boyle">Boyle, J.

[[File:Mausoleum of Omar Khayyám.jpg|alt=Mausoleum of Omar Khayyám|thumb|[[Mausoleum of Omar Khayyám]] in [[Nishapur]], [[Iran]]. It uses [[Symbol|symbolic]] [[Iranian architecture|Persian architecture]].]]
His boyhood was spent in Nishapur.<ref name="The Cambridge History of Iran" />{{rp|659}} His gifts were recognized by his early tutors who sent him to study under Imam Muwaffaq Nishaburi, the greatest teacher of the Khorasan region who tutored the children of the highest nobility.

In about 1070 he moved to [[Samarkand]], where he started to compose his famous [[Omar Khayyam#Mathematics|treatise on algebra]] under the patronage of Abu Tahir Abd al-Rahman ibn ʿAlaq, the governor and [[Qadi|chief judge]] of the city.<ref name=Rosenfeld>Boris A.

In 1073–4 peace was concluded with [[Sultan]] [[Malik-Shah I]] who had made incursions into Karakhanid dominions. Khayyam entered the service of Malik-Shah in 1074–5 when he was invited by the [[vizier|Grand Vizier]] [[Nizam al-Mulk]] to meet Malik-Shah in the city of [[Merv|Marv]]. Khayyam was subsequently commissioned to set up an observatory in [[Isfahan]] and lead a group of scientists in carrying out precise astronomical observations aimed at the revision of the Persian calendar. The undertaking began probably in 1076 and ended in 1079<ref name="The Wine of Wisdom"/>{{rp|28}} when Omar Khayyam and his colleagues concluded their measurements of the length of the year, reporting it to 14 significant figures with astounding accuracy.
[[File:ارامگاه خیام - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Khayyam Neyshaburi Mausoleum in [[Nishapur|Neyshabur]], [[Iran]]]]
After the death of Malik-Shah and his vizier (murdered, it is thought, by the [[Ismaili]] [[order of Assassins]]), Omar fell from favor at court, and as a result, he soon set out on his [[Hajj|pilgrimage to Mecca]]. A possible ulterior motive for his pilgrimage reported by [[Al-Qifti]], was a public demonstration of his faith with a view to allaying suspicions of skepticism and confuting the allegations of unorthodoxy (including possible sympathy to Zoroastrianism) leveled at him by a hostile clergy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Aminrazavi|first=Mehdi|date=2010|title=Review of Omar Khayyam: Poet, Rebel, Astronomer|journal=Iranian Studies|volume=43|issue=4|pages=569–571|issn=0021-0862|jstor=23033230|doi=10.1080/00210862.2010.495592|s2cid=162241136}}</ref><ref name="The Wine of Wisdom" />{{rp|29}} He was then invited by the new [[Sultan Sanjar]] to Marv, possibly to work as a court [[astrologer]].<ref name="Britannica">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/428267/Omar-Khayyam |title=Omar Khayyam (Persian poet and astronomer) |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |access-date=30 May 2012}}</ref> He was later allowed to return to Nishapur owing to his declining health.

Omar Khayyam died at the age of 83 in his hometown of Nishapur on 4 December 1131, and he is buried in what is now the [[Mausoleum of Omar Khayyám|Mausoleum of Omar Khayyam]]. One of his disciples [[Nizami Aruzi]] relates the story that sometime during 1112–3 Khayyam was in [[Balkh]] in the company of [[Al-Isfizari]] (one of the scientists who had collaborated with him on the Jalali calendar) when he made a prophecy that "my tomb shall be in a spot where the north wind may scatter roses over it".<ref name="Boyle"/>{{rp|36}}<ref name="FitzGerald"/> Four years after his death, Aruzi located his tomb in a cemetery in a then large and well-known quarter of Nishapur on the road to Marv. As it had been foreseen by Khayyam, Aruzi found the tomb situated at the foot of a garden-wall over which pear trees and peach trees had thrust their heads and dropped their flowers so that his tombstone was hidden beneath them.<ref name="Boyle"/>

==Mathematics==
Khayyam was famous during his life as a [[mathematician]]. His surviving mathematical works include: ''A commentary on the difficulties concerning the postulates of Euclid's Elements'' ({{lang|ar|Risāla fī šarḥ mā aškala min muṣādarāt kitāb Uqlīdis}}, completed in December 1077<ref name="Iranica Online" />), ''On the division of a [[Quadrant (circle)|quadrant of a circle]]'' ({{lang|ar|Risālah fī qismah rub‘ al-dā’irah}}, undated but completed prior to the treatise on algebra<ref name="Iranica Online" />), and ''On proofs for problems concerning Algebra'' ({{lang|ar-Latn|Maqāla fi l-jabr wa l-muqābala}}, most likely completed in 1079<ref name="Struik" />{{rp|281}}). He furthermore wrote a treatise on the [[binomial theorem]] and extracting the [[nth root|n<sup>th</sup> root]] of natural numbers, which has been lost.<ref name="The Wine of Wisdom" />{{rp|197}}

===Theory of parallels===
{{See also|Non-Euclidean geometry#History|Parallel postulate#History|l1=History of non-Euclidean geometry|l2=Parallel postulate}}
A part of Khayyam's commentary on Euclid's Elements deals with the [[parallel axiom]].<ref name="Struik" />{{rp|282}} The treatise of Khayyam can be considered the first treatment of the axiom not based on [[petitio principii]], but on a more intuitive postulate. Khayyam refutes the previous attempts by other mathematicians to ''prove'' the proposition, mainly on grounds that each of them had postulated something that was by no means easier to admit than the Fifth Postulate itself.<ref name="Iranica Online" /> Drawing upon [[Aristotle]]'s views, he rejects the usage of movement in geometry and therefore dismisses the different attempt by [[Ibn al-Haytham|Al-Haytham]].<ref name="rozenfeld-ch2">{{harv|Rozenfeld|1988|pp=64–65}}</ref><ref name="katz">{{harv|Katz|1998|p=270}}. Excerpt: ''In some sense, his treatment was better than ibn al-Haytham's because he explicitly formulated a new postulate to replace Euclid's rather than have the latter hidden in a new definition.''</ref> Unsatisfied with the failure of mathematicians to prove Euclid's statement from his other postulates, Omar tried to connect the axiom with the Fourth Postulate, which states that all right angles are equal to one another.<ref name="Struik" />{{rp|282}}

Khayyam was the first to consider the three distinct cases of acute, obtuse, and right angle for the summit angles of a [[Saccheri quadrilateral|Khayyam-Saccheri quadrilateral]].<ref name="Struik" />{{rp|283}} After proving a number of theorems about them, he showed that Postulate V follows from the right angle hypothesis, and refuted the obtuse and acute cases as self-contradictory.<ref name="Iranica Online" /> His elaborate attempt to prove the parallel postulate was significant for the further development of geometry, as it clearly shows the possibility of non-Euclidean geometries. The hypotheses of acute, obtuse, and right angles are now known to lead respectively to the non-Euclidean [[hyperbolic geometry]] of Gauss-Bolyai-Lobachevsky, to that of [[Riemannian geometry]], and to [[Euclidean geometry]].<ref>Rolwing, R. & Levine, M. (1969). "The Parallel Postulate". ''The Mathematics Teacher'', 62(8), 665–669.</ref>

[[File:Khayyam-paper-1stpage.png|thumb|"Cubic equation and intersection of conic sections" the first page of a two-chaptered manuscript kept in Tehran University.]]

[[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi|Tusi]]'s commentaries on Khayyam's treatment of parallels made its way to Europe. [[John Wallis]], professor of geometry at Oxford, translated Tusi's commentary into Latin. Jesuit geometer [[Girolamo Saccheri]], whose work (''euclides ab omni naevo vindicatus'', 1733) is generally considered the first step in the eventual development of [[non-Euclidean geometry]], was familiar with the work of Wallis. The American historian of mathematics [[David Eugene Smith]] mentions that Saccheri "used the same lemma as the one of Tusi, even lettering the figure in precisely the same way and using the lemma for the same purpose". He further says that "Tusi distinctly states that it is due to Omar Khayyam, and from the text, it seems clear that the latter was his inspirer."<ref name="Great Muslim Mathematicians" />{{rp|104}}<ref>Smith, David (1935). "Euclid, Omar Khayyam and Saccheri," ''Scripta Mathematica''.</ref><ref name="The Wine of Wisdom" />{{rp|195}}

====The real number concept====
This treatise on Euclid contains another contribution dealing with the [[Proportionality (mathematics)|theory of proportions]] and with the compounding of ratios. Khayyam discusses the relationship between the concept of ratio and the concept of number and explicitly raises various theoretical difficulties. In particular, he contributes to the theoretical study of the concept of [[irrational number]].<ref name="Iranica Online" /> Displeased with Euclid's definition of equal ratios, he redefined the concept of a number by the use of a continuous fraction as the means of expressing a ratio. Rosenfeld and Youschkevitch (1973) argue that "by placing irrational quantities and numbers on the same operational scale, [Khayyam] began a true revolution in the doctrine of number." Likewise, it was noted by [[Dirk Jan Struik|D. J. Struik]] that Omar was "on the road to that extension of the number concept which leads to the notion of the [[real number]]."<ref name="Struik" />{{rp|284}}

===Geometric algebra===

The intersection point produced by the circle and the hyperbola determine the desired segment.]]

Rashed and Vahabzadeh (2000) have argued that because of his thoroughgoing geometrical approach to algebraic equations, Khayyam can be considered the precursor of [[Descartes]] in the invention of [[analytic geometry]].<ref name ="Cooper">Cooper, G. (2003). ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', 123(1), 248–249.</ref>{{rp|248}} In ''The Treatise on the Division of a Quadrant of a Circle'' Khayyam applied algebra to geometry. In this work, he devoted himself mainly to investigating whether it is possible to divide a circular quadrant into two parts such that the line segments projected from the dividing point to the perpendicular diameters of the circle form a specific ratio. His solution, in turn, employed several curve constructions that led to equations containing cubic and quadratic terms.<ref name="Cooper" />{{rp|248}}

====The solution of cubic equations====
Khayyam seems to have been the first to conceive a general theory of cubic equations<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Khayyam.html|title=Khayyam biography|website=www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk|access-date=13 July 2018|quote=However, Khayyam himself seems to have been the first to conceive a general theory of cubic equations.}}</ref> and the first to geometrically solve every type of cubic equation, so far as positive roots are concerned.<ref>Howard Eves (1958).

Khayyam was the [[mathematician]] who noticed the importance of a general binomial theorem. The argument supporting the claim that Khayyam had a general binomial theorem is based on his ability to extract roots.<ref>J. L.

[[File:Jalaali Leap Year.svg|thumb|Representation of the intercalation scheme of the Jalali calendar]]
In 1074–5, Omar Khayyam was commissioned by Sultan Malik-Shah to build an [[Isfahan Observatory|observatory at Isfahan]] and reform the [[Iranian calendar|Persian calendar]]. There was a panel of eight scholars working under the direction of Khayyam to make large-scale astronomical observations and revise the astronomical tables.<ref name="Evelyn Kennedy" />{{rp|141}} Recalibrating the calendar fixed the first day of the year at the exact moment of the passing of the Sun's center across [[March equinox|vernal equinox]]. This marks the beginning of spring or [[Nowrūz]], a day in which the Sun enters the first degree of [[Aries (constellation)|Aries]] before noon.<ref>{{cite arxiv|first=Musa|last= Akrami|title= The development of Iranian calendar: historical and astronomical foundations|eprint=1111.4926|class= physics.hist-ph|year= 2011}}</ref>

The Jalālī calendar was a true [[solar calendar]] where the duration of each month is equal to the time of the passage of the Sun across the corresponding sign of the [[Zodiac]]. The calendar reform introduced a unique 33-year [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]] cycle. As indicated by the works of [[al-Khazini|Khazini]], Khayyam's group implemented an intercalation system based on quadrennial and quinquennial [[leap years]]. Therefore, the calendar consisted of 25 ordinary years that included 365 days, and 8 leap years that included 366 days.<ref>{{cite arxiv|first=M|last= Heydari-Malayeri|title= concise review of the Iranian calendar|eprint=astro-ph/0409620|year= 2004}}</ref> The calendar remained in use across [[Greater Iran]] from the 11th to the 20th centuries. In 1911 the Jalali calendar became the official national calendar of [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar Iran]]. In 1925 this calendar was simplified and the names of the months were modernized, resulting in the [[Iranian calendars#Modern calendar: Solar Hijri (SH)|modern Iranian calendar]]. The Jalali calendar is more accurate than the [[Gregorian calendar]] of 1582,<ref name="The Cambridge History of Iran" />{{rp|659}} with an error of one day accumulating over 5,000 years, compared to one day every 3,330 years in the Gregorian calendar.<ref name="The Wine of Wisdom" />{{rp|200}}
[[Moritz Cantor]] considered it the most perfect calendar ever devised.<ref name="Great Muslim Mathematicians"/>{{rp|101}}

One of his pupils [[Nizami Aruzi|Nizami Aruzi of Samarcand]] relates that Khayyam apparently did not have a belief in astrology and divination: "I did not observe that he (''scil.'' Omar Khayyam) had any great belief in astrological predictions, nor have I seen or heard of any of the great [scientists] who had such belief."<ref name="Whinfield" />{{rp|11}} While working for Sultan Sanjar as an astrologer he was asked to predict the weather – a job that he apparently did not do well.<ref name="The Wine of Wisdom" />{{rp|30}} George Saliba (2002) explains that the term {{lang|ar-Latn|‘ilm al-nujūm}}, used in various sources in which references to Omar's life and work could be found, has sometimes been incorrectly translated to mean astrology. He adds: "from at least the middle of the tenth century, according to [[Farabi]]'s enumeration of the sciences, that this science, {{lang|ar|‘ilm al-nujūm}}, was already split into two parts, one dealing with astrology and the other with theoretical mathematical astronomy."<ref>Saliba, G. (2002). ''Iranian Studies'', 35(1/3), 220–225.</ref>{{rp|224}}

{{See also|specific gravity}}
He has a short treatise devoted to [[Archimedes' principle]] (in full title, ''On the Deception of Knowing the Two Quantities of Gold and Silver in a Compound Made of the Two''). For a compound of gold adulterated with silver, he describes a method to measure more exactly the weight per capacity of each element. It involves weighing the compound both in air and in water, since weights are easier to measure exactly than volumes. By repeating the same with both gold and silver one finds exactly how much heavier than water gold, silver and the compound were. This treatise was extensively examined by [[Eilhard Wiedemann]] who believed that Khayyam's solution was more accurate and sophisticated than that of [[al-Khazini|Khazini]] and [[Al-Nayrizi]] who also dealt with the subject elsewhere.<ref name="The Wine of Wisdom" />{{rp|198}}

Another short treatise is concerned with [[music theory]] in which he discusses the connection between music and arithmetic. Khayyam's contribution was in providing a systematic classification of musical scales, and discussing the mathematical relationship among notes, minor, major and [[tetrachords]].<ref name="The Wine of Wisdom" />{{rp|198}}

==Poetry==
[[File:Chayyam guyand kasan behescht ba hur chosch ast2.png|thumb|right|Rendition of a ''ruba'i'' from the Bodleian manuscript, rendered in [[Shekasteh]] calligraphy.]]
The earliest allusion to Omar Khayyam's poetry is from the historian [[Imad ad-Din al-Isfahani]], a younger contemporary of Khayyam, who explicitly identifies him as both a poet and a scientist ({{lang|ar-Latn|Kharidat al-qasr}}, 1174).<ref name="The Wine of Wisdom" />{{rp|49}}<ref name="Dashti">Ali Dashti (translated by L. P. Elwell-Sutton), ''In Search of Omar Khayyam'', Routledge Library Editions: Iran (2012)</ref>{{rp|35}} One of the earliest specimens of Omar Khayyam's Rubiyat is from [[Fakhr al-Din Razi]]. In his work {{lang|ar|Al-tanbih ‘ala ba‘d asrar al-maw‘dat fi’l-Qur’an}} (ca. 1160), he quotes one of his poems (corresponding to quatrain LXII of FitzGerald's first edition). [[Najm al-Din Razi|Daya]] in his writings ({{lang|ar|Mirsad al-‘Ibad}}, ca. 1230) quotes two quatrains, one of which is the same as the one already reported by Razi. An additional quatrain is quoted by the historian [[Ata-Malik Juvayni|Juvayni]] ({{lang|fa|[[Tarikh-i Jahangushay]]}}, ca. 1226–1283).<ref name="Dashti" />{{rp|36–37}}<ref name="The Wine of Wisdom" />{{rp|92}} In 1340 Jajarmi includes thirteen quatrains of Khayyam in his work containing an anthology of the works of famous Persian poets ({{lang|ar-Latn|Munis al-ahrār}}), two of which have hitherto been known from the older sources.<ref name = "Ross 1927">Edward Denison Ross, ''Omar Khayyam'', Bulletin of the School Of Oriental Studies London Institution (1927)</ref> A comparatively late manuscript is the [[Bodleian Library|Bodleian]] MS. Ouseley 140, written in [[Shiraz]] in 1460, which contains 158 quatrains on 47 folia. The manuscript belonged to [[William Ouseley]] (1767–1842) and was purchased by the Bodleian Library in 1844.[[File:Inscript in Morića Han.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Era inscription of a poem written by Omar Khayyam at [[Morića Han]] in [[Sarajevo]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]]]There are occasional quotes of verses attributed to Omar in texts attributed to authors of the 13th and 14th centuries, but these are of doubtful authenticity, so that skeptical scholars point out that the entire tradition may be [[pseudepigraphic]].<ref name="Dashti" />{{rp|11}}
[[Hans Heinrich Schaeder]] in 1934 commented that the name of Omar Khayyam "is to be struck out from the history of Persian literature" due to the lack of any material that could confidently be attributed to him.
De Blois (2004) presents a bibliography of the manuscript tradition, concluding pessimistically that the situation has not changed significantly since Schaeder's time.<ref>Francois De Blois, ''Persian Literature – A Bio-Bibliographical Survey: Poetry of the Pre-Mongol Period'' (2004), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=2e55wuzPc3IC&pg=PA307 p. 307].</ref>
Five of the quatrains later attributed to Omar are found as early as 30 years after his death, quoted in ''[[Sindbad-Nameh]]''. While this establishes that these specific verses were in circulation in Omar's time or shortly later, it doesn't imply that the verses must be his. De Blois concludes that at the least the process of attributing poetry to Omar Khayyam appears to have begun already in the 13th century.<ref>Francois De Blois
, ''Persian Literature – A Bio-Bibliographical Survey: Poetry of the Pre-Mongol Period'' (2004), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=2e55wuzPc3IC&pg=PA305 p. 305].</ref> [[Edward Granville Browne]] (1906) notes the difficulty of disentangling authentic from spurious quatrains: "while it is certain that Khayyam wrote many quatrains, it is hardly possible, save in a few exceptional cases, to assert positively that he wrote any of those ascribed to him".<ref name="The Cambridge History of Iran" />{{rp|663}}

In addition to the Persian quatrains, there are twenty-five Arabic poems attributed to Khayyam which are attested by historians such as al-Isfahani, [[Al-Shahrazuri|Shahrazuri]] ({{lang|ar-Latn|Nuzhat al-Arwah}}, ca. 1201–1211), Qifti ({{lang|ar|Tārikh al-hukamā}}, 1255), and [[Hamdallah Mustawfi]] ({{lang|fa|[[Tarikh-i guzida]]}}, 1339).<ref name="The Wine of Wisdom" />{{rp|39}}

[[John Andrew Boyle|Boyle]] and [[Richard N. Frye|Frye]] (1975) emphasize that there are a number of other [[Persian scholar|Persian scholars]] who occasionally wrote quatrains, including Avicenna, Ghazzali, and Tusi. He concludes that it is also possible that for Khayyam poetry was an amusement of his leisure hours: "these brief poems seem often to have been the work of scholars and scientists who composed them, perhaps, in moments of relaxation to edify or amuse the inner circle of their disciples".<ref name="The Cambridge History of Iran" />{{rp|662}}

The poetry attributed to Omar Khayyam has contributed greatly to his popular fame in the modern period as a direct result of the extreme popularity of the translation of such verses into English by [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward FitzGerald]] (1859). FitzGerald's ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]'' contains loose translations of quatrains from the Bodleian manuscript. It enjoyed such success in the [[fin de siècle]] period that a bibliography compiled in 1929 listed more than 300 separate editions,<ref>Ambrose George Potter, ''A Bibliography of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam'' (1929).</ref> and many more have been published since.<ref>Francois De Blois

==Philosophy==
[[File:Bucureşti - Omar Khayam 3.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Omar Khayyam in [[Bucharest]]]]
Khayyam considered himself intellectually to be a student of [[Avicenna]].<ref name="NasrAnthology">Nasr, S. H., & Aminrazavi, M. (2007). ''Anthology of philosophy in Persia: from Zoroaster to Omar Khayyam''.{{ISBN?}}</ref> According to Al-Bayhaqi, he was reading the metaphysics in Avicenna's ''[[the Book of Healing]]'' before he died.<ref name="The Cambridge History of Iran" />{{rp|661}} There are six philosophical papers believed to have been written by Khayyam. One of them, ''On existence'' ({{lang|ar|Fi’l-wujūd}}), was written originally in Persian and deals with the subject of existence and its relationship to universals. Another paper, titled ''The necessity of contradiction in the world, determinism and subsistence'' ({{lang|ar|Darurat al-tadād fi’l-‘ālam wa’l-jabr wa’l-baqā’}}), is written in Arabic and deals with [[free will]] and [[determinism]].<ref name="NasrAnthology" />{{rp|475}} The titles of his other works are ''On being and necessity'' ({{lang|ar|Risālah fī’l-kawn wa’l-taklīf}}), ''The Treatise on Transcendence in Existence'' ({{lang|ar|Al-Risālah al-ulā fi’l-wujūd}}), ''On the knowledge of the universal principles of existence'' ({{lang|ar|Risālah dar ‘ilm kulliyāt-i wujūd}}), and ''Abridgement concerning natural phenomena'' ({{lang|ar|Mukhtasar fi’l-Tabi‘iyyāt}}).

===Religious views===
[[File:آرامگاه عمر خیام.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Omar Khayyam]]
A literal reading of Khayyam's quatrains leads to the interpretation of his philosophic attitude toward life as a combination of [[pessimism]], [[nihilism]], [[Epicureanism]], [[fatalism]], and [[agnosticism]].<ref name="The Wine of Wisdom" />{{rp|6}}<ref>Boscaglia, F.

Princeton Legacy Library: Michael Beard</ref> Hedayat (1923) states that "while Khayyam believes in the transmutation and transformation of the human body, he does not believe in a separate soul; if we are lucky, our bodily particles would be used in the making of a jug of wine."<ref>Katouzian, H. (1991). Sadeq Hedayat: The life and literature of an Iranian writer (p. 138). London: I.B. Tauris</ref> In a later study (1934–35) he further contends that Khayyam's use of Sufic terminology such as "wine" is literal and that he turned to the [[Carpe diem|pleasures of the moment]] as an antidote to his existential sorrow: "Khayyam took refuge in wine to ward off bitterness and to blunt the cutting edge of his thoughts."<ref name="Bashiri">{{cite web|last1=Bashiri|first1=Iraj|title=Hedayat's Learning|url=http://www.angelfire.com/rnb/bashiri/Fiction/Learning.html}}</ref> In this tradition, Omar Khayyam's poetry has been cited in the context of [[New Atheism]], e.g. in ''[[The Portable Atheist]]'' by [[Christopher Hitchens]].<ref>Hitchens, C. (2007). The portable atheist: Essential readings for the nonbeliever (p. 7). Philadelphia, PA: Da Capo.</ref>

[[Al-Qifti]] (ca. 1172–1248) appears to confirm this view of Omar's philosophy.<ref name="The Cambridge History of Iran" />{{rp|663}} In his work ''The History of Learned Men'' he reports that Omar's poems were only outwardly in the Sufi style, but were written with an anti-religious agenda.<ref name="E.D.

Ross" />{{rp|355}}

In the context of a piece entitled ''On the Knowledge of the Principles of Existence'', Khayyam endorses the Sufi path.<ref name="The Wine of Wisdom" />{{rp|8}} Csillik (1960) suggests the possibility that Omar Khayyam could see in Sufism an ally against orthodox religiosity.<ref name="Csillik">Csillik, B.

The French translator J. B. Nicolas held that Omar's constant exhortations to drink wine should not be taken literally, but should be regarded rather in the light of Sufi thought where rapturous intoxication by "wine" is to be understood as a metaphor for the enlightened state or divine rapture of ''[[baqaa]]''.<ref>Albano, G.

Aminrazavi (2007) states that "Sufi interpretation of Khayyam is possible only by reading into his ''Rubāʿīyyāt'' extensively and by stretching the content to fit the classical Sufi doctrine."<ref name="The Wine of Wisdom" />{{rp|128}} Furthermore, Frye (1975) emphasizes that Khayyam was intensely disliked by a number of celebrated Sufi mystics who belonged to the same century. This includes [[Shams Tabrizi]] (spiritual guide of [[Rumi]]),<ref name="The Wine of Wisdom" />{{rp|58}} [[Najm al-Din Razi|Najm al-Din Daya]] who described Omar Khayyam as "an unhappy philosopher, atheist, and materialist",<ref name="Bowen" />{{rp|71}} and [[Attar of Nishapur|Attar]] who regarded him not as a fellow-mystic but a free-thinking scientist who awaited punishments hereafter.<ref name="The Cambridge History of Iran" />{{rp|663}}

[[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]] argues that it is "reductive" to use a literal interpretation of his verses (many of which are of uncertain authenticity to begin with) to establish Omar Khayyam's philosophy. Instead, he adduces Khayyam's interpretive translation of [[Avicenna]]'s treatise ''Discourse on Unity'' ({{lang|ar-Latn|Al-Khutbat al-Tawhīd}}), where he expresses orthodox views on [[tawhid|Divine Unity]] in agreement with the author.<ref name=nasrkhayyamphil>[[#refNasr|S.

The various biographical extracts referring to Omar Khayyam describe him as unequalled in scientific knowledge and achievement during his time.<ref>e.g. by the author of ''Firdaws al-tawārikh'' (Ross 1898:356), author of ''Tārikh alfī'' (Ross 1898:358), and [[al-Isfahani]] (Aminrazavi 2007:49).</ref> Many called him by the epithet ''King of the Wise'' ({{lang-ar|ملك الحکماء}}).<ref name="Ross 1927" />{{rp|436}}<ref name="Evelyn Kennedy" />{{rp|141}} [[Shahrazuri]] (d. 1300) esteems him highly as a mathematician, and claims that he may be regarded as "the successor of Avicenna in the various branches of philosophic learning".<ref name="E.D.

[[Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall]] (1774–1856) translated some of Khayyam's poems into German in 1818, and [[Gore Ouseley]] (1770–1844) into English in 1846, but Khayyam remained relatively unknown in the West until after the publication of [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward FitzGerald]]'s ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]'' in 1859. FitzGerald's work at first was unsuccessful but was popularised by [[Whitley Stokes]] from 1861 onward, and the work came to be greatly admired by the [[Pre-Raphaelites]]. In 1872 FitzGerald had a third edition printed which increased interest in the work in America. By the 1880s, the book was extremely well known throughout the English-speaking world, to the extent of the formation of numerous "Omar Khayyam Clubs" and a "fin de siècle cult of the Rubaiyat".<ref>J.

In 2009, the state of Iran donated a [[Scholars Pavilion|pavilion]] to the [[United Nations Office in Vienna]], inaugurated at [[Vienna International Center]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unis.unvienna.org/unis/pressrels/2009/unisvic167.html|title=Monument to Be Inaugurated at the Vienna International Centre, 'Scholars Pavilion' donated to International Organizations in Vienna by Iran|last=UNIS}}</ref> In 2016, three statues of Khayyam were unveiled: one at the [[University of Oklahoma]], one in Nishapur and one in Florence, Italy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://new.tehrantimes.com/news/300191/Khayyam-statue-finally-set-up-at-University-of-Oklahoma|title=Khayyam statue finally set up at University of Oklahoma|website=Tehran Times|language=en|access-date=4 April 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405082018/http://new.tehrantimes.com/news/300191/Khayyam-statue-finally-set-up-at-University-of-Oklahoma|archive-date=5 April 2016}}</ref> Over 150 [[composer]]s have used the ''Rubaiyat'' as their source of inspiration.

FitzGerald rendered Omar's name as "Tentmaker", and the anglicized name of "Omar the Tentmaker" resonated in English-speaking popular culture for a while. Thus, [[Nathan Haskell Dole]] published a novel called ''Omar, the Tentmaker: A Romance of Old Persia'' in 1898. ''Omar the Tentmaker of Naishapur'' is a historical novel by John Smith Clarke, published in 1910. "Omar the Tentmaker" is also the title of a 1914 play by [[Richard Walton Tully]] in an oriental setting, adapted as a [[Omar the Tentmaker (film)|silent film]] in 1922. US General [[Omar Bradley]] was given the nickname "Omar the Tent-Maker" in World War II.<ref>Jeffrey D. Lavoie, ''The Private Life of General Omar N. Bradley'' (2015), p. 13.</ref>

The French-Lebanese writer [[Amin Maalouf]] based the first half of his historical fiction novel ''[[Samarkand (novel)|Samarkand]]'' on Khayyam's life and the creation of his Rubaiyat. The sculptor [[Eduardo Chillida]] produced four massive iron pieces titled ''Mesa de Omar Khayyam'' (Omar Khayyam's Table) in the 1980s.<ref>[https://www.museoreinasofia.es/en/collection/artwork/mesa-omar-khayyam-ii-omar-khayyams-table-ii Omar Khayyam's Table II] Retrieved 8 August 2021.</ref><ref>[https://www.macba.cat/en/art-artists/artists/chillida-eduardo/mesa-omar-khayyam-iii Omar Khayyam's Table III] Retrieved 8 August 2021.</ref>

The [[lunar crater]] [[Omar Khayyam (crater)|Omar Khayyam]] was named in his honour in 1970, as was the [[minor planet]] [[3095 Omarkhayyam]] discovered by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] astronomer [[Lyudmila Zhuravlyova]] in 1980.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=ru&q=3094+Chukokkala |title=Dictionary of Minor Planet Names |page=255 |date=1979|access-date=8 September 2012|via=Google Books}}</ref>
