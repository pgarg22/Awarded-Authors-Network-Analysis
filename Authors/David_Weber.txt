Weber's novels range from [[epic fantasy]] (''Oath of Swords'', ''The War God's Own'') to [[space opera]] (''Path of the Fury'', ''The Armageddon Inheritance'') to [[alternate history]] (''1632'' series with [[Eric Flint]]) and [[military science fiction]] with in-depth characterization.<ref>{{cite web|website=Convergence-Con |url=http://www.convergence-con.org/convergence/node/95 |title=Convergence |date=2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105230546/http://www.convergence-con.org/convergence/node/95 |archive-date=January 5, 2009 |df=mdy }}</ref>

A lifetime military history buff, David Weber has carried his interest of history into his fiction. He is said to be interested in most periods of history, with a strong emphasis on the military and diplomatic aspects.<ref name="CrowsNest">{{Cite web | url = http://www.sfcrowsnest.com/articles/features/2002/In-Honor-I-gained-them-5718.php | title = In Honor I gained them | access-date = February 2, 2011 | author = Stephen Hunt | year = 2002 | publisher = SF Crowsnest.com | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120312051327/http://www.sfcrowsnest.com/articles/features/2002/In-Honor-I-gained-them-5718.php | archive-date = March 12, 2012 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

Weber prefers to write about strong characters. He develops a character's background story in advance in considerable detail because he wants to achieve that degree of comfort level with the character.<ref name="WildViolet"/> Weber has said he writes primarily in the evenings and at night.<ref name="CrowsNest"/>

Weber says he makes an effort to accept as many invitations to science fiction conferences and conventions as he can, because he finds the direct feedback from readers that he gets at conventions extremely useful. He makes a habit of [[Tuckerization|Tuckerizing]] people from fandom, particularly in the Honor Harrington books (see, e.g., [[Jordin Kare#Filk music and science fiction|Jordin Kare]]).<ref name="CrowsNest"/>

In 2008, Weber donated his archive to the Department of Rare Books and Special Collections at [[Northern Illinois University]].<ref>{{cite web|website=Ulib.niu.edu |url=http://www.ulib.niu.edu/rarebooks/sciencefiction.cfm |title=Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA) Collection |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603071546/http://www.ulib.niu.edu/rarebooks/sciencefiction.cfm |archive-date=June 3, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>

Weber is a [[United Methodist Church|United Methodist]] lay preacher, and tries to explore in his writing how religions (both real-life and fictional) can be forces for good on the one hand, and misused to defend evil causes on the other.<ref name="DW Interview">{{cite AV media |title=An Interview with David Weber, Part 4  |medium=YouTube Video |language=en|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_k6ZPGGBfA |access-date=14 September 2015 |publisher=Blackfive TV }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baen.com/Interviews/vintDWeber.htm |website=Baen |title=Blackfive video interview with David Weber |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803102251/http://www.baen.com/Interviews/vintDWeber.htm |archive-date=August 3, 2009 |df=mdy }}</ref>
