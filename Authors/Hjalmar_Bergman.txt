'''Hjalmar Fredrik Elgérus Bergman''' (19 September 1883 in [[Örebro]], Sweden – 1 January 1931 in [[Berlin]], [[Weimar Republic|Germany]]) was a Swedish writer and playwright.

==Biography==
The son of a banker in [[Örebro]], Bergman briefly studied philosophy at [[Uppsala University]] but soon broke off his studies and took up the life of a free writer. He married [[Stina Bergman|Stina Lindberg]], the daughter of actor and stage producer [[August Lindberg (actor)|August Lindberg]] and [[Augusta Lindberg]], and sister of [[Per Lindberg]]. Up to his father's death in 1915 Bergman was heavily sponsored by the family patriarch; after the old man died from a stroke it turned out that the family business had become highly indebted and Bergman was forced to start making money out of his writing and court readers in a more outgoing and more entertaining manner. He rose to the challenge and in the following ten years reached the peak of his work.

Much of his output takes place in a small town in mid-Sweden, which is growing into a parallel universe in a Balzacian manner. The shameful secrets of a dozen of interwoven families gradually come out of the closet as the stories grow increasingly symbolic. A pessimistic outlook is always counterbalanced by a grotesque humour - indeed in a book like ''Markurells i Wadköping'' the latter almost succeeds in completely shading the former. The fictional town Wadköping is modelled on the author's hometown [[Örebro]]. When Örebro in 1965 opened its open-air museum featuring 19th century city life, it was named Wadköping.

After an unsuccessful bout as a manuscript writer in Hollywood Bergman's alcoholism and narcotics abuse took over, from which he died prematurely; his final novel ''Clownen Jac'' mirrors his awareness of his drift into self-destruction as well as his belief in the honesty and purpose of artistic spectacle.
