'''Isabella Kelly''', née '''Fordyce''', also '''Isabella Hedgeland''' (1759–1857) was a [[List of Scottish novelists|Scottish novelist]] and [[poet]].<ref name="ODNB">Richard Greene, "Kelly, Isabella (baptised 1759, died 1857)", rev. Pam Perkins, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/37626. Retrieved 19 March 2015]</ref> Her novels have been said to resemble those of [[Ann Radcliffe]].

==Family==
Isabella Fordyce was born at [[Cairnburgh Castle]] in the [[Scottish Highlands]] and baptised on 4 May 1759, as the daughter of William Fordyce, [[Royal Marines]] officer and later courtier, and Elizabeth (née Fraser). Both her parents had been disowned after their marriage by their wealthy Scottish families.

She married Robert Hawke Kelly (died in or before 1807, probably in [[Madras]]), a spendthrift East India Company officer.<ref name="ODNB"/> They had at least three children, including two daughters (one of whom may have died in childhood) and a lawyer son, [[Fitzroy Edward Kelly]], who became [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney-General]]. Another son William was strongly befriended as a boy by the writer [[Matthew Lewis (writer)|Matthew Lewis]], perhaps with sexual intent.<ref>Iain Powell: "Isabella Kelly – Genuine Gothic Genius?"

She died aged 98 at 20 [[Chapel Street, Belgravia|Chapel Street]] (presumably the one in [[Belgravia]]), London, on 25 June 1857 and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery.<ref name="ODNB"/>

==Poems==
Kelly's ''Collection of Poems and Fables'' (1794, 2nd e. 1807) was well subscribed. She claimed that several pieces in it had been written before she was 14.<ref name="ODNB"/> It "includes pathos and social comedy.... She later called her poems 'too personal to please in general'."<ref name="Feminist" />

==Novels==
Kelly's ten novels "cater[ed] to popular taste with seemingly haunted abbeys, cross-dressing for disguise, and the fruits of unchastity." She told the [[Royal Literary Fund]] in 1832 that she had written ten novels, educational works, and some of a new historical novel that she knew was outdated.<ref name="Feminist" /> Several were published by [[Minerva Press]].<ref>Orlando entry.

Critics have noted a similarity to the work of Ann Radcliffe in her approach to the Gothic novel.<ref>See this analysis of Kelly's ''The Abbey of St. Asaph'' by Tenille Nowak: [http://studiesingothicfiction.weebly.com/uploads/2/2/8/8/22885250/studies_v2_issue_2.pdf Retrieved 20 March 2015.]</ref> The ''[[British Critic]]'', writing in 1798, concedes that ''Joscelina...'' is innocent and instructive, but faults it for leading the heroine "through such a variety of trials and miseries, as could hardly fall to the lot of any human creature."<ref>''The British Critic'', Vol. 11, p. 317. [https://books.google.com/books?id=pQAwAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA316&lpg=PA316&dq=%22isabella+kelly%22+novelist&source=bl&ots=zx-dKO-KbA&sig=wwQv82rHWTFq0SuKmTCvdNVt0QE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=zFgLVfekHMP7ywPY9IKACw&ved=0CCAQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&q=%22isabella%20kelly%22%20novelist&f=false Retrieved 20 March 2015.]</ref> In ''Eva'', Kelly was one of several authors of the day, including Matthew Lewis, to attack celibacy, through her character Agatha, who refuses to go into a nunnery because it is cruelly oppressive to deny women "the normal blessings of home and children."<ref>Mary Ellen Snodgrass: ''Encyclopedia of Gothic Literature'' (New York, 2005), p. 11.</ref>

Her novel ''The Secret'' was dismissed briefly but squarely by the [[Monthly Review (London)|''Monthly Review'']] in October 1806: "Those who delight in useless mysteries and unnecessary horrors may perhaps be gratified by reading these volumes: but, in our judgment, the contemplation of such stories is attended with worse consequences than the mere waste of time. It tends to produce a sickly and irritable state of mind, gives a temporary shock even to intellects that are sound and healthy, but enervates and permanently diseases those which are weak."<ref>Quoted in Gothic Heroine blog.
