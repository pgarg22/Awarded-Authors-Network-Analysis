Called the "punk poet laureate", Smith fused rock and poetry in her work. Her most widely known song is "[[Because the Night]]", which was co-written with [[Bruce Springsteen]]. It reached number 13 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart in 1978<ref name="Allmusic bio"/> and number five in the U.K.  In 2005, Smith was named a Commander of the ''[[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]]'' by the [[Ministry of Culture (France)|French Ministry of Culture]].<ref name="Ordre">{{cite web |title=''Remise des insignes de Commandeur dans l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres à Patti Smith 'Solidays''' |url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/actualites/conferen/donnedieu/patti_smith.html |publisher=[[Minister of Culture (France)|French Ministry of Culture]] |location=Paris |language=fr |date=July 10, 2005|access-date=April 18, 2009}}</ref> In 2007, she was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref name="R&R hall">{{cite web |title=Patti Smith profile |url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/patti-smith |publisher=[[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] |location=Cleveland, Ohio |year=2007 |access-date=April 18, 2009}}</ref>

On November 17, 2010, Smith won the [[National Book Award]] for her memoir ''[[Just Kids]]''.<ref name=nba2010/> The book fulfilled a promise she had made to her former long-time partner, [[Robert Mapplethorpe]].

At this early age Smith was exposed to her first records, including ''Shrimp Boats'' by [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Patience and Prudence]]'s ''The Money Tree'', and ''[[Another Side of Bob Dylan]]'', which her mother gave to her. Smith graduated from [[Deptford Township High School]] in 1964 and went to work in a factory.<ref name="Allmusic bio" /><ref name="autogenerated20">Smith, Patti (2010). ''Just Kids'', p. 20.

=== 1967–1973: New York ===
In 1967, she left Glassboro State College (now [[Rowan University]]) and moved to [[Manhattan]] in [[New York City]]. She met photographer [[Robert Mapplethorpe]] there while working at a bookstore with friend and poet [[Janet Hamill]]. She and Mapplethorpe had an intense romantic relationship, which was tumultuous as the pair struggled with times of poverty, and Mapplethorpe with his own sexuality. Smith considers Mapplethorpe to be one of the most important people in her life, and in her book ''[[Just Kids]]'' refers to him as "the artist of my life." Mapplethorpe's photographs of her became the covers for the Patti Smith Group albums, and they remained lifelong friends until Mapplethorpe's death in 1989.<ref>{{cite interview|last=Smith |first=Patti |title=A conversation with singer Patti Smith |url=http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/5297 |type=Interview: Video |work=[[Charlie Rose (talk show)|Charlie Rose]] |publisher=[[WNET]] |location=New York |date=October 17, 1997 |access-date=January 12, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110121123432/http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/5297 |archive-date=January 21, 2011 }}</ref> Her book and album ''[[The Coral Sea (album)|The Coral Sea]]'' would be an homage to the life of Mapplethorpe and ''Just Kids'' would tell the story of their relationship. She would also write essays for several of Mapplethorpe's books, starting from one, at his request, for his posthumous ''Flowers''.<ref>[[Just Kids]]</ref>

She went to Paris with her sister in 1969, and started [[busking]] and doing [[performance art]].<ref name="Arista bio"/> When Smith returned to [[Manhattan]], she lived in the [[Hotel Chelsea]] with Mapplethorpe; they frequented [[Max's Kansas City]] and [[CBGB]]. Smith provided the [[spoken word]] soundtrack for Sandy Daley's art film ''Robert Having His Nipple Pierced'', starring Mapplethorpe. The same year Smith appeared with [[Jayne County|Wayne County]] in [[Jackie Curtis]]'s play ''Femme Fatale''. Afterward, she also starred in [[Anthony Ingrassia|Tony Ingrassia]]'s play ''Island''. As a member of the [[St. Mark's Poetry Project]], she spent the early 1970s painting, writing, and performing. In 1971 she performed – for one night only – in ''[[Cowboy Mouth (play)|Cowboy Mouth]]'',<ref name="RS bio">{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pattismith/biography |title=Patti Smith: Biography |access-date=February 4, 2008 |encyclopedia=The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll |year=2001 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212083500/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pattismith/biography <!--Added by H3llBot--> |archive-date=December 12, 2007}}</ref> a play that she co-wrote with [[Sam Shepard]]. (The published play's notes call for "a man who looks like a coyote and a woman who looks like a crow".) She wrote several poems, "for sam shepard"<ref>"for sam shepard," in ''[[Creem]]'' Sept. 1971 [http://www.oceanstar.com/patti/poetry/forsam.htm link]</ref> and "Sam Shepard: 9 Random Years (7 + 2)"<ref>included in ''Angel City, Curse of the Starving Class & Other Plays (1976)'', ([http://www.oceanstar.com/patti/info/books.htm bibliographic information])</ref> about her relationship with Shepard.

Smith was briefly considered for the lead singer position in [[Blue Öyster Cult]]. She contributed lyrics to several of the band's songs, including "Debbie Denise" (inspired by her poem "In Remembrance of Debbie Denise"), "Baby Ice Dog", "Career of Evil", "[[Fire of Unknown Origin]]", "The Revenge of Vera Gemini" (on which she performs duet vocals), and "Shooting Shark". She was romantically involved at the time with the band's keyboardist, [[Allen Lanier]]. During these years, Smith also wrote rock journalism pieces, some of which were published in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and ''[[Creem]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?fid1=25407 |title=Patti Smith Fights the Good Fight – Timeline |access-date=December 5, 2008 |last=Khanna |first=Vish |date=May 2007 |work=Exclaim! |location=Canada |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124001953/http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?fid1=25407 |archive-date=January 24, 2009 }}</ref>

=== 1974–1979: Patti Smith Group ===
[[File:Patti Smith.jpg|thumb|Smith performing at [[Cornell University]], 1978]]
By 1974, Patti Smith was performing rock music, initially with guitarist, bassist and rock archivist [[Lenny Kaye]], and later with a full band comprising Kaye, [[Ivan Kral]] on guitar and bass, [[Jay Dee Daugherty]] on drums and [[Richard Sohl]] on piano. Kral was a refugee from [[Czechoslovakia]] who had moved to the United States in 1966 with his parents, who were diplomats. After the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in 1968, he decided not to return.<ref>{{cite news |last=Bezr |first=Ondřej |date=June 25, 2010 |title=    Český rocker Ivan Král vstoupil s Patti Smith do Kongresové knihovny |url=http://kultura.idnes.cz/cesky-rocker-ivan-kral-vstoupil-s-patti-smith-do-kongresove-knihovny-1kc-/hudba.aspx?c=A100625_142908_hudba_ob |newspaper=Mladá fronta DNES  |access-date=August 20, 2014|trans-title=Czech rocker Ivan Král entered the Congress library with Patti Smith |language=cs}}</ref> Financed by [[Sam Wagstaff]], the band recorded a first single, "[[Hey Joe]] / [[Piss Factory]]", in 1974.

[[File:Patti Smith in Rosengrten 1978.jpg|thumb|right|Smith performing with the Patti Smith Group, in West Germany, 1978]]

Later that same year, she performed spoken poetry on "I Wake Up Screaming" from [[Ray Manzarek]]'s ''[[The Whole Thing Started with Rock & Roll Now It's Out of Control]]'' album.

The Patti Smith Group was signed by [[Clive Davis]] of [[Arista Records]], and in 1975 recorded their first album, ''[[Horses (album)|Horses]]'', produced by [[John Cale]] amid some tension. The album fused [[punk rock]] and spoken poetry and begins with a cover of [[Van Morrison]]'s "[[Gloria (Them song)|Gloria]]", and Smith's opening words: "Jesus died for somebody's sins but not mine" (an excerpt from "Oath", one of her early poems). The austere cover photograph by Mapplethorpe has become one of rock's classic images.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.superseventies.com/greatestalbumcovers.html |title=Seventies' Greatest Album Covers |access-date=February 4, 2008 |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=November 14, 1991}}</ref> As the popularity of punk rock grew, the Patti Smith Group toured the United States and Europe. The rawer sound of the group's second album, ''[[Radio Ethiopia]]'', reflected this. Considerably less accessible than ''Horses'', ''Radio Ethiopia'' initially received poor reviews. However, several of its songs have stood the test of time, and Smith still performs them regularly in concert.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://setlists.pattismithlogbook.info/years/2007.html |title=Patti Smith setlists, 2007 |access-date=February 7, 2008}}</ref> She has said that ''Radio Ethiopia'' was influenced by the band [[MC5]].<ref name=Moore/>

On January 23, 1977, while touring in support of ''Radio Ethiopia'', Smith accidentally danced off a high stage in [[Tampa, Florida]], and fell 15 feet into a concrete [[orchestra pit]], breaking several neck [[vertebra]]e.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pattismithlogbook.info/logbook/chronology/1977/19770123.htm|title=Patti Smith chronology|access-date=February 4, 2008}}</ref> The injury required a period of rest and an intensive round of [[physical therapy]], during which time she was able to reassess, re-energize and reorganize her life.

The Patti Smith Group produced two further albums before the end of the 1970s. ''[[Easter (Patti Smith Group album)|Easter]]'' (1978) was her most commercially successful record, containing the single "[[Because the Night]]" co-written with [[Bruce Springsteen]]. ''[[Wave (Patti Smith Group album)|Wave]]'' (1979) was less successful, although the songs "[[Frederick (song)|Frederick]]" and "[[Dancing Barefoot]]" both received commercial airplay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pattismithland.com/sotw.htm|title=Song of the Week: Dancing Barefoot |access-date=February 26, 2008|author=Smith, Patti|year=2002|archive-date=January 12, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112181302/http://www.pattismithland.com/sotw.htm}}</ref>

[[File:Patti Smith daughter Jesse Smith 2011 Shankbone.JPG|thumb|Smith with her daughter Jesse Smith at the 2011 [[Time 100|''Time'' 100]] gala]]
Before the release of ''Wave'', Smith, now separated from long-time partner [[Allen Lanier]], met [[Fred "Sonic" Smith]], former guitar player for Detroit rock band [[MC5]] and his own [[Sonic's Rendezvous Band]], who adored poetry as much as she did. ''Wave''{{'}}s "Dancing Barefoot" (inspired by [[Jeanne Hébuterne]] and her tragic love for [[Amedeo Modigliani]]) and "Frederick" were both dedicated to him.<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=song|id=t830026|pure_url=yes}}|title=Dancing Barefoot|access-date=February 7, 2008 |author=Deming, Mark|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> The running joke at the time was that she married Fred only because she would not have to change her name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://babellist.xnet2.com/9903/msg00195.html|title=Babel-list|access-date=February 7, 2008|year=1999|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409041747/http://babellist.xnet2.com/9903/msg00195.html|archive-date=April 9, 2009}}</ref> They had a son, Jackson (b. 1982), who would go on to marry [[The White Stripes]] drummer, [[Meg White]], in 2009;<ref>{{cite news|title=Meg White and Jackson Smith wed in Nashville|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/entertainment/2009264040_apusmusicmegwhite.html|newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=May 26, 2009|access-date=October 19, 2012}}</ref> and a daughter, Jesse Paris, who is also a musician and composer<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/jesse-paris-smith-mn0002835668/biography|title=Jesse Paris Smith &#124; Biography & History|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=September 5, 2020}}</ref> (b. 1987).

Through most of the 1980s Smith was in semi-retirement from music, living with her family north of Detroit in [[St. Clair Shores, Michigan]]. In June 1988, she released the album ''[[Dream of Life]]'', which included the song "[[People Have the Power]]". Fred Smith died on November 4, 1994, of a heart attack. Shortly afterward, Patti faced the unexpected death of her brother Todd.<ref name="Arista bio"/>

When her son Jackson turned 14, Smith decided to move back to New York. After the impact of these deaths, her friends [[Michael Stipe]] of [[R.E.M.]] and [[Allen Ginsberg]] (whom she had known since her early years in New York) urged her to go back out on the road. She toured briefly with [[Bob Dylan]] in December 1995 (chronicled in a book of photographs by Stipe).<ref name="RS bio"/>

=== 1996–2003: Re-emergence ===
In 1996, Smith worked with her long-time colleagues to record ''[[Gone Again]],'' featuring "About a Boy", a tribute to [[Kurt Cobain]]. That same year she collaborated with Stipe on "[[E-Bow the Letter]]", a song on R.E.M.'s ''[[New Adventures in Hi-Fi]],'' which she has also performed live with the band.<ref>{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r240302|pure_url=yes}} |title=New Adventures in Hi-Fi |access-date=February 7, 2008 |author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> After the release of ''Gone Again,'' Patti Smith recorded two new albums:  ''[[Peace and Noise]]'' in 1997 (with the single "[[1959 (Patti Smith song)|1959]]", about the [[Invasion of Tibet (1950–1951)|invasion of Tibet]]) and ''[[Gung Ho (album)|Gung Ho]]'' in 2000 (with songs about [[Ho Chi Minh]] and Smith's late father). Songs "1959" and "[[Glitter in Their Eyes]]" were nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/grammy/rockfemale.htm |title=Grammy Awards: Best Rock Vocal Performance – Female |access-date=March 6, 2008}}</ref> A box set of her work up to that time, ''[[The Patti Smith Masters]],'' came out in 1996, and 2002 saw the release of ''[[Land (1975–2002)]],'' a two-CD compilation that includes a cover of [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s "[[When Doves Cry]]". Smith's [[Solo show (art exhibition)|solo art exhibition]] ''[[Strange Messenger]]'' was hosted at [[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh|The Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh]] on September 28, 2002.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.warhol.org/whats_on/pdfs/PR_Patti_Smith.pdf |title=The Andy Warhol Museum Announces Patti Smith Performance and Retrospective Exhibition |access-date=March 19, 2008 |date=May 3, 2002 |publisher=The Andy Warhol Museum |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061231060409/http://www.warhol.org/whats_on/pdfs/PR_Patti_Smith.pdf |archive-date = December 31, 2006}}</ref>

=== 2004–2009 ===
On April 27, 2004, Patti Smith released ''[[Trampin']]'', which included several songs about motherhood, partly in tribute to Smith's mother, who had died two years before. It was her first album on [[Columbia Records]], soon to become a [[Sony BMG|sister label]] to her previous home [[Arista Records]]. Smith curated the [[Meltdown (festival)|Meltdown festival]] in London on June 25, 2005, the penultimate event being the first live performance of ''Horses'' in its entirety.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/fridayreview/story/0,,1497477,00.html|title=Some give a song.

This live performance was released later in the year as ''[[Horses/Horses]]''.[[File:Patti Smith performing at Primavera Sound Festival, Barcelona.jpg|thumb|left|Smith performing at Primavera Sound Festival (2007)]]

On July 10, 2005, Smith was named a Commander of the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] by the [[Minister of Culture (France)|French Ministry of Culture]].<ref name="Ordre"/> In addition to Smith's influence on rock music, the Minister also noted her appreciation of [[Arthur Rimbaud]]. In August 2005, Smith gave a literary lecture about the poems of Arthur Rimbaud and [[William Blake]]. On October 15, 2006, Patti Smith performed at the [[CBGB]] nightclub, with a 3½-hour ''tour de force'' to close out [[Manhattan]]'s music venue. She took the stage at 9:30&nbsp;p.m. (EDT) and closed for the night (and forever for the venue) at a few minutes after 1:00&nbsp;am, performing her song "Elegie", and finally reading a list of punk rock musicians and advocates who had died in the previous years.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/16/arts/music/16cnd-cbgbnotebook.html?ei=5088&en=b87ef3abc56fb771&ex=1318651200&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&pagewanted=all |title=Fans of a Groundbreaking Club Mourn and Then Move On|access-date=February 4, 2008|author=Pareles, Jon|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 16, 2006}}</ref>

It's not an easy listen—the vast majority of her music never has been—but if you're a fan and/or prepared for the challenge, this is as potent, heady and uncompromising as she has ever gotten, and with Smith's storied history as a musical maverick, that's saying plenty."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2012/06/patti-smith-banga/|title=Patti Smith: Banga|magazine=[[American Songwriter]]|access-date=June 8, 2012}}</ref> The critical aggregator website [[Metacritic]] awarded the album a score of 81, indicating "universal acclaim".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/banga/patti-smith/critic-reviews|title=Banga by Patti Smith|website=Metacritic.com|access-date=September 6, 2017}}</ref>

"Without Chains"<ref>[http://pattismith.net/audio/Without_Chains.mp3 "Without Chains" mp3] at PattiSmith.net</ref> is about [[Murat Kurnaz]], a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] citizen who was born and raised in Germany, held at [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp]] for four years. Jury's article quotes Smith as saying:

{{blockquote|I wrote both these songs directly in response to events that I felt outraged about. These are injustices against children and the young men and women who are being incarcerated. I'm an American, I pay taxes in my name and they are giving millions and millions of dollars to a country such as Israel and [[cluster bomb]]s and defense technology and those bombs were dropped on common citizens in Qana.

In 2020, Smith contributed signed first-edition copies of her books to the Passages bookshop in Portland, Oregon, after the store was burgled of a number of valuable first-edition and other books by various authors. She did so after reading about the burglary and its impact on the owner, stating that she "loves bookstores."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/05/patti-smith-burgled-oregon-bookshop-first-editions-poet-singer-thefts-portland|title=Patti Smith pitches in to help burgled Oregon bookshop|last=Flood|first=Alison|date=2020-02-05|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-02-05|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

==Beliefs==
=== Religion ===
Smith was raised a [[Jehovah's Witness]] and had a strong religious upbringing and a [[Bible|Biblical]] education. She left [[organized religion]] as a teenager because she felt it was too confining. In response to this experience, she wrote the line "Jesus died for somebody's sins, but not mine" in her cover version of "[[Gloria (Them song)|Gloria]]" by [[Them (band)|Them]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spinner.aol.com/rockhall/patti-smith-2007-inductee/interview|title=Exclusive Interview with Patti Smith|author=Robertson, Jessica|year=2007|work=[[Spinner (website)|Spinner]]|publisher=[[AOL]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516062624/http://spinner.aol.com/rockhall/patti-smith-2007-inductee/interview|archive-date=May 16, 2007|url-status=dead|access-date=February 4, 2008}}</ref> She has described having an avid interest in [[Tibetan Buddhism]] around the age of eleven or twelve, saying "I fell in love with [[Tibet]] because their essential mission was to keep a continual stream of prayer," but that as an adult she sees clear parallels between different forms of religion, and has come to the conclusion that [[Dogma|religious dogmas]] are "...&nbsp;man-made laws that you can either decide to abide by or not."<ref name="Moore" />

In [[2014]] she was invited  by [[Pope Francis]] to play at Vatican Christmas concert.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/pope-francis-invites-patti-smith-play-vatican-christmas-concert-9860643.html " Pope Francis invites Patti Smith to play at Vatican Christmas concert"], Denham, Jess, ''The Independent'', 14 November 2014.

Anyone who would confine me to a line from 20 years ago is a fool! I had a strong religious upbringing, and the first word on my first LP is Jesus. I did a lot of thinking. I’m not against Jesus, but I was 20 and I wanted to make my own mistakes and I didn’t want anyone dying for me. I stand behind that 20-year-old girl, but I have evolved. I’ll sing to my enemy! I don’t like being pinned down and I’ll do what the fuck I want, especially at my age … oh, I hope there’s no small children here!”<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/nov/18/patti-smith-christmas-concert-vatican "Patti Smith on singing at the Vatican: 'Anyone who would confine me to an old line is a fool'"], Goldman, Vivien, ''The Guardian'', 18 Nov 2014. Retrieved 24 July 2021</ref> She performed at the Vatican again and told ''[[Democracy Now!]]'' that she had studied [[Francis of Assisi]] back when [[Pope Benedict XVI]] was still the pope. Smith called Francis of Assisi a "truly the environmentalist saint" and said that despite not being a Catholic, she had hoped for a pope named Francis.<ref>[https://www.democracynow.org/2015/10/8/people_have_the_power_patti_smith "'People Have the Power': Patti Smith on Pope Francis and Her Performances at the Vatican"], ''Democracy Now!'', 8 October 2015. Retrieved 24 July 2021.</ref>

=== Feminism and women in music ===
According to biographer Nick Johnstone, Smith has often been "revered" as a "feminist icon",<ref>{{cite book|title=Patti Smith: A Biography|last=Johnstone|first=Nick|chapter=Introduction|publisher=Omnibus Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0857127785}}</ref> including by ''[[The Guardian]]'' journalist [[Simon Hattenstone]] in a 2013 profile on the musician.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hattenstone|first=Simon|author-link=Simon Hattenstone|date=May 25, 2013|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/25/patti-smith-interview-punk-poet|title=Patti Smith: punk poet queen|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=March 23, 2020}}</ref>

In 2014, Smith offered her opinion on the sexualization of women in music. "Pop music has always been about the mainstream and what appeals to the public. I don't feel it's my place to judge." As at points earlier in her life and career, she declined to embrace feminism: "I have a son and a daughter, people always talk to me about feminism and women's rights, but I have a son too—I believe in human rights."<ref>{{cite news|author1=Ella Alexander|title=Patti Smith, self-confessed Rihanna fan, on the sexualisation of women in music: 'No one should allow themselves to be exploited'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/patti-smith-self-confessed-rihanna-fan-on-the-sexualisation-of-women-in-music-no-one-should-allow-9233468.html|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|access-date=June 1, 2017|date=April 2, 2014}}</ref>

In 2015, writer Anwen Crawford observed that Smith's "attitude to genius seems pre-feminist, if not anti-feminist; there is no democratizing, deconstructing impulse in her work. True artists, for Smith, are remote, solitary figures of excellence, wholly dedicated to their art."<ref>{{cite magazine|author1=Anwen Crawford|title=The Theology of Patti Smith|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-theology-of-patti-smith|magazine=[[The New Yorker]]|access-date=June 1, 2017|date=October 6, 2015}}</ref>
