'''Peter Flannery''' (born 12 October 1951) is an English [[playwright]] and [[screenwriter]]. He was born in [[Jarrow]], [[County Durham]] and educated at the [[University of Manchester]]. He is best known for his work while a resident playwright at the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Notable plays during his tenure include: ''Savage Amusement'' (1978), ''Awful Knawful'' (1978), and ''Our Friends in the North'' (1982). Other theatre work has included ''Singer'' (1989).

He is perhaps best known to a wider audience for his highly-acclaimed television adaptation of ''[[Our Friends in the North]]'', produced by the [[BBC]] and screened on [[BBC Two|BBC2]] in 1996. The epic nine-part [[serial (radio and television)|serial]], charting the course of the lives of four friends from Newcastle from 1964 to 1995, was voted by the [[British Film Institute]] in 2000 as one of the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] of the 20th century. Flannery's other television work has included ''Blind Justice'' (1988), a series about the work of radical lawyers. At the 1997 [[British Academy Television Awards]], Flannery was given the honorary [[Dennis Potter]] Award for outstanding achievement in television writing.

In January 2007, he scripted an adaptation of [[Alan Hunter (author)|Alan Hunter]]'s ''Inspector Gently'' novels, entitled [[Inspector George Gently|''George Gently'']], for [[BBC One]] to be broadcast later in the year. Flannery changed the setting of the stories from [[Suffolk]] to the [[North East England|North East]] in the 1960s and created new characters who had not featured in the novels. ''George Gently'' is produced by [[Company Pictures]], reuniting Flannery with  ''Our Friends in the North'' producer [[Charles Pattinson]], who co-runs Company and is an [[executive producer]] on the series alongside Flannery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/01_january/18/gently.shtml|title=Martin Shaw returns to BBC One in George Gently|publisher=[[bbc.co.uk]]|date=2007-01-18|access-date=2007-01-19}}</ref> The drama was eventually shown on 8 April 2007. The seventh series – now titled ''Inspector George Gently'' – was screened in the spring of 2015.

Flannery has also worked in film, although with less success than in other media. He wrote the [[screenplay]]s for films such as ''[[Funny Bones]]'' (1995) and ''[[The One and Only (2002 film)|The One and Only]]'' (2002).

In 2008, [[Channel 4]] transmitted Flannery's mini-series about the [[English Civil War]], ''[[The Devil's Whore]]'', on which he had worked for more than a decade.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/06/10/nround110.xml | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714064820/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/06/10/nround110.xml | url-status=dead | archive-date=14 July 2007 | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Channel 4 sexes up the Puritans | first1=Chris | last1=Hastings | date=10 June 2007 | access-date=22 May 2010}}</ref> In 2014, the channel released a four-part continuation, titled ''New Worlds''.
