==Acting career==
After his medical discharge from the army in 1916, Ridley commenced a career as a professional actor. In 1918 he joined the company of the [[Birmingham Repertory Theatre]], staying for two years and playing 40 parts before moving on to [[Plymouth]], where he took a break from the stage when his war injuries began to trouble him.<ref name="auto"/>

After being stranded for an evening at [[Mangotsfield railway station]], near Bristol, Ridley was inspired to write the play ''[[The Ghost Train (play)|The Ghost Train]]'' (1923),<ref name="radio46Jul12" /> a tale of passengers stranded at a haunted railway station in [[Cornwall]], with one of the characters being an incognito British Government agent trying to catch [[Bolshevik]] revolutionaries active in Great Britain. The play was produced on stage, and became a hit, with 665 performances being staged consecutively in London's West End, and two revivals. ''The Ghost Train'' was first [[The Ghost Train (1931 film)|filmed in 1931]] and again [[The Ghost Train (1941 film)|in 1941]] when it starred [[Arthur Askey]]. Ridley also wrote more than 30 other plays including ''[[The Wrecker (play)|The Wrecker]]'' (1924), ''Keepers of Youth'' (1929), ''[[The Flying Fool (play)|The Flying Fool]]'' (1929) and ''Recipe for Murder'' (1932).<ref>Obituary, ''The Times'', 14 March 1984</ref><ref>Amnon Kabatchnik ''Blood on the Stage, 1975–2000: Milestone Plays of Crime'' 2012 -. – Page 554 "A dastardly blackmailer is shot and poisoned simultaneously in Arnold Ridley's Recipe for Murder (1932)."</ref>

During his time in military service in the Second World War he adapted the [[Agatha Christie]] novel ''Peril at End House'' into a [[Peril at End House (play)|West End play]] that premiered in 1940. Ridley's post-war play, ''Beggar My Neighbour'', was first performed in 1951<ref>[http://www.doollee.com/PlaywrightsR/ridley-arnold.html "Plays by Arnold Ridley"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830121635/http://www.doollee.com/PlaywrightsR/ridley-arnold.html |date=30 August 2017 }}, Doollee website</ref> and adapted for the [[Ealing Comedies|Ealing Comedy]] film ''[[Meet Mr. Lucifer]]'' (1953).

Ridley worked regularly as an actor, including an appearance in the British comedy ''[[Crooks in Cloisters]]'' (1964). He also played Doughy Hood, the village baker, in the radio soap opera ''[[The Archers]]'' and the Rev. Guy Atkins in the [[Associated Television|ATV]] soap ''[[Crossroads (UK TV series)|Crossroads]]'' from the programme's inception in 1964 until 1968. However, he became a household name only after he was cast as [[Private Godfrey]], the gentle platoon medic in the television comedy series ''[[Dad's Army]]'' (1968–1977). He continued to appear into his eighties, and was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire|OBE]] in the 1982 Queen's New Year Honours List, for services to the theatre.<ref name="auto"/>
