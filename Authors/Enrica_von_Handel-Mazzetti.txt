==Life==
[[File:Sterbehaus von Enrica von Handel-Mazzetti.jpg|thumb|left|A plaque to her memory]]
Enrica Freifrau von Handel-Mazzetti was born in [[Vienna]] in 1871 and her father, Baron Heinrich Hypolith of Handel-Mazzetti, died young before her birth. She was educated well, studying history and languages. After her mother died, she went to live with a bachelor uncle, Baron Anton von Handel-Mazzetti, in [[Steyr]] in 1901. Her cousin was the botanist [[Heinrich von Handel-Mazzetti]].<ref>[http://www.paeo.de/h1/hand_maz/pioneer/04biography.html Heinrich Handel-Mazzetti: A Botanical Pioneer In South West China], Paeo.de, retrieved 16 August 2014</ref> She moved with her uncle to [[Linz]] when he was promoted in 1911. This was in the middle of her most productive period when her books were being serialised in magazines as well as being published and enthusiastically received.<ref name=avm>[http://www.ooegeschichte.at/themen/kunst-und-kultur/literaturgeschichte-oberoesterreichs/literaturgeschichte-ooe-in-abschnitten/1900-1945/enrica-von-handel-mazzetti/ Enrica Handel-Mazzetti], Petra-Maria Dallinger, Austrian Virtual Museum, retrieved 16 August 2014</ref>

She stayed in Linz for the rest of her life, notably joining a protest against book burning in 1933.  The following year she nearly died from an untreatable eye condition.

When 25 members of the [[PEN International|PEN Club]] passed a resolution to protest the [[Nazi book burnings]], Enrica von Handel-Mazzetti and other nationalist, [[Völkisch movement|racist]] and catholic authors did not agree and quit the Club.<ref name="Oedl">[http://www.sbg.ac.at/exil/lecture_5003_11.html Ulrike Oedl, in: Ueberblicke; UNI-Salzburg; 2002 –- Das Exilland Österreich zwischen 1933 und 1938]{{dead link|date=April 2018|archivebot=2018-04-08 11:40:19 InternetArchiveBot |url=http://www.sbg.ac.at/exil/lecture_5003_11.html }}, retrieved 10/09/2008.</ref>

Her work was not encouraged by the [[Nazi]] regime, although she stayed in Linz, apart from when the bombing was really bad when she briefly moved to [[Elisabethinen]] in 1944.
