==Biography==
Agard grew up in [[Georgetown, British Guiana|Georgetown]], British Guiana (now [[Guyana]]). He loved to listen to [[cricket]] commentary on the radio and began making up his own, which led to a love of language.<ref Name="Jubilee"/> He went on to study English, French and Latin at [[A-Level]], writing his first poetry when he was in sixth-form, and left school in 1967. He taught the languages he had studied and worked in a local library. He was also a sub-editor and feature writer for the ''[[Guyana Chronicle|Guyana Sunday Chronicle]]'', publishing two books while he was still in Guyana.<ref Name="Jubilee">[http://www.jubileebooks.co.uk/2002/09/john-agard/ John Agard profile] at Jubilee Books.</ref>
