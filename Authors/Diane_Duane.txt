'''Diane Duane''' (born  May 18, 1952) is an American [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] author, long based in Ireland. Her works include the ''[[Young Wizards]]'' young adult fantasy series and the ''[[Rihannsu]]'' [[Star Trek novels]].

==Biography==
Born in [[New York City]], she grew up in [[Roosevelt, New York|Roosevelt, Long Island]]. After school, she studied [[nurse|nursing]] and practiced as a [[psychiatric nurse]] for two years until 1976, when she moved to [[California]] and worked as an assistant to [[David Gerrold]]. Her first novel was published by [[Dell (publisher)|Dell Books]] in 1979; Gerrold wrote an "overture" to that novel, on the grounds that he'd rather be making overtures than introductions to Duane's work.<ref>{{cite book|title= The Door Into Fire|last= Duane|first= Diane|edition= 1st|year= 1979|publisher= Dell Publishing Co., Inc.|location= [[New York City]]|pages= 7 (footnote)|isbn= 0-440-11874-3}}</ref> She subsequently worked as a freelance writer. In 1981 she moved to [[Pennsylvania]]. 

She married [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] author [[Peter Morwood]] in 1987; they moved to the United Kingdom and then to Ireland, where they reside in [[County Wicklow]].<ref>{{cite news

A short story within the same universe, "Uptown Local", has also been published as part of [[Jane Yolen]]'s ''Dragons and Dreams'' anthology, and a podcast of Duane reading it is freely available from her website. It also appears in the twentieth anniversary edition of ''So You Want to Be a Wizard''.

In February 2011, Duane announced she would be releasing new versions of the first 4 books in the series,<ref>http://dduane.livejournal.com/185997.html?thread=2017933#t2017933 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814102031/http://dduane.livejournal.com/185997.html?thread=2017933 |date=2011-08-14 }}</ref> updating the technology used in the books, fixing some timeline issues within the series, and overall making the series more appealing to contemporary young adult readers. The first of the series would be available in June 2011, initially in ebook format,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dianeduane.com/outofambit/2011/05/30/young-wizards-new-millennium-editions-a-little-more-info/|title=Young Wizards New Millennium Editions: a little more info|first=Diane|last=Duane|date=May 30, 2011|website=Out of Ambit|access-date=Jan 24, 2020}}</ref> with the next three books to follow in the succeeding months and all these to have new ISBNs,<ref>http://dduane.livejournal.com/185997.html?thread=2019469#t2019469 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814102120/http://dduane.livejournal.com/185997.html?thread=2019469 |date=2011-08-14 }}</ref> with the publisher switching to the revised editions with new covers around the time the next book in the series is released.

===Feline Wizards===
The series, in the same setting as the Young Wizards novels, focuses on cat-wizards, who maintain the worldgates that wizards use for travel between the sheaf of canonical universes.

===Adult Wizards===
Books about adult wizards set in the same universe of the Young Wizards series.
* "Theobroma", featured in the fantasy short story collection ''Wizards, Inc.'' (November 2007)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.youngwizards.com/theobroma/|title=Theobroma|first=YWCom|last=Admin|date=Aug 4, 2016|website=Young Wizards|access-date=Jan 24, 2020}}</ref>

===Alternate Universes===
The Young Wizards universe contains canonical alternate universes (''[[So You Want to Be a Wizard]]'' and ''[[To Visit the Queen]]'' are good examples: the protagonists travel to alternate universes to solve problems there).
* ''Stealing the Elf-King's Roses'' ({{ISBN|0-446-60983-8}}) is set in a sheaf of universes originally mentioned{{Page needed|date=November 2010}} in Nita's studies in ''So You Want to Be a Wizard.''

===The Middle Kingdoms===
Also known as the ''Tale of the Five'', this high fantasy series was paused in 1992.{{when|date=September 2018}} The books center on some of the same themes as her better-known Young Wizards series; those who wield the Blue Fire have many of the same responsibilities as the wizards and fight the same battle against [[entropy]]. In ''So You Want to Be a Wizard'', Nita's wizardry manual is written by "Hearnssen", a reference to the protagonist of ''The Door Into Fire'', Herewiss s'Hearn (son of Hearn), so it may be that the Middle Kingdoms are part of the same sheaf of universes as the Young Wizards setting. Adding to this, one interdimensional portal in ''The Door into Fire'' appears to open over New York City. Duane is working on the final volume.{{when|date=September 2018}} ''The Door into Fire'' and ''The Door into Shadow'' have an omnibus reprint called ''Tale of Five: The Sword and the Dragon.'' ({{ISBN|978-1892065513}})
# ''The Door into Fire'' (1979)
# ''The Door into Shadow'' (1984)
# ''The Door into Sunset'' (1992)
# ''The Door into Starlight'' (to be written)

Several short stories are set in the Middle Kingdoms:
''Parting Gifts'' (1981) and its prequel ''The Span'' (1999) featuring Sirronde; Duane plans to write a middle novella and publish the three together as ''Sirronde's World''.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://blogs.feministsf.net/?p=972|access-date= 2010-12-11|title= Diane Duane's Tale of the Five at Feminist SF - The Blog!|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110723125822/http://blogs.feministsf.net/?p=972|archive-date= 2011-07-23}}</ref>
''Lior and the Sea'' (1985) is set in the world of the Middle Kingdoms, but not concerning any of the characters in the novels.

Duane also worked on ''Tales of the Five'', a five-book series to bridge the gap between ''The Door into Sunset'' and ''The Door into Starlight''. Books in this series so far are:
* ''The Levin-Gad'' (2018)
* ''The Landlady'' (2019)
* ''The Librarian'' (TBA)

===Other prose works===
Duane has recently{{when|date=September 2018}} made available in various e-formats a previously unpublished book which was sold to at least two European publishers, but never actually brought out due to internal restructuring at one publishing house (Corgi) and the sale of another (Heyne Verlag). The novel, ''A Wind from the South'', is the first of a projected trilogy telling the story of a young girl born in the 11th century in a remote region of the Alps. This girl slowly discovers that she is the intended physical avatar of an exiled Roman goddess, while (as she grows) she becomes caught up in the political turmoil of [[William Tell]]'s time.

Duane was also responsible for prose adaptations of several scripts from ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]''. She has also written numerous short stories, about equally divided between fantasy and science fiction, which have appeared in various anthologies and collections over the last twenty years. She also wrote the 1985 [[text adventure]] video game ''[[Star Trek: The Kobayashi Alternative]]''.<ref name="mobygames">{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/c64/star-trek-the-kobayashi-alternative/credits|title=Star Trek: The Kobayashi Alternative Credits|work=[[MobyGames]]|access-date=22 January 2017}}</ref>

=== Maps ===

Duane drew the map in [[Larry Niven]]'s ''[[The Ringworld Engineers]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Ringworld engineers|last=Larry.|first=Niven|date=1980|publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston|isbn=0345334302|location=New York|oclc=5286215}}</ref>

==Screen works: film and television==
Duane has worked in television since the early 1980s, initially becoming involved in script work at the [[Hanna-Barbera]] animation studio (now [[Cartoon Network]]). After writing numerous scripts for such series as ''[[Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo (1979 TV series)|Scooby and Scrappy-Doo]]'', ''[[Captain Caveman]]'', ''[[Space Stars]]'', ''[[Fonz and the Happy Days Gang]]'', ''[[Biskitts]]'', and ''[[Laverne and Shirley in the Army]]'', she moved on to work in development and serve as a staff writer at [[Filmation]], and in 1985 was hired to story-edit the [[DiC]] animated series ''[[Dinosaucers]]''. During this period she also wrote scripts for [[Sunbow Productions]] (''[[Glo Friends]]'', ''[[Transformers series|Transformers]]'', and ''[[My Little Pony]]'') and [[Walt Disney Productions]] (''[[Duck Tales]]''). In 1986, she co-wrote (with [[Michael Reaves]]) the script of one of the earliest episodes of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', "[[Where No One Has Gone Before]]".

In the early 1990s Duane was brought on board as the head writer on the [[BBC]] Television educational series ''Science Challenge''. Shortly thereafter she co-wrote (with her husband) scripts for ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' and for ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]''. She also wrote the screenplay for the 1996 space adventure game ''Privateer&nbsp;2&nbsp;-&nbsp;The Darkening'', which starred [[Clive Owen]], [[Christopher Walken]], [[Jürgen Prochnow]] and [[Mathilda May]]. Other screen work from that period includes the screenplay for the ''[[Space Island One]]'' episode "Not In My Back Yard" (1998–1999).

In 2003, after doing nearly four years' development work with the production company [[Tandem Communications]] of Munich, Germany, Duane and Peter Morwood co-wrote the script for the German TV miniseries ''Die Nibelungen''. The miniseries aired in Germany on the [[Sat.1]] network in late November 2004, and a feature version (titled ''[[Sword of Xanten]]'') screened in the UK in December 2004. A "megafeature" cut of the entire miniseries was aired on [[Channel Four]] television in the UK in December 2005. The miniseries aired on the Sci-Fi Channel in the US in late March 2006 under the title ''[[Dark Kingdom: The Dragon King]]''. The miniseries has also been released on DVD in the US and numerous other markets, under various titles (the previous US title was ''[[Curse of the Ring]]'').

Duane was also a co-author of the [[Barbie]] movie ''[[Barbie: Fairytopia]]''.<ref>
