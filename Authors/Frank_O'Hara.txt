'''Francis Russell''' "'''Frank'''" '''O'Hara''' (March 27, 1926 – July 25, 1966) was an American writer, poet, and art critic. A curator at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], O'Hara became prominent in New York City's art world. O'Hara is regarded as a leading figure in the [[New York School (art)|New York School]], an informal group of artists, writers, and musicians who drew inspiration from jazz, [[surrealism]], [[abstract expressionism]], [[action painting]], and contemporary [[avant-garde]] art movements.

O'Hara's poetry is personal in tone and content, and has been described as sounding "like entries in a diary".<ref name="OHaraACLSAmericanNatlBio">American Council of Learned Societies. "Frank O'Hara" in ''American National Biography''. (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999)</ref> Poet and critic [[Mark Doty]] has said O'Hara's poetry is "urbane, ironic, sometimes genuinely celebratory and often wildly funny" containing "material and associations alien to academic verse" such as "the camp icons of movie stars of the twenties and thirties, the daily landscape of social activity in Manhattan, jazz music, telephone calls from friends".<ref>Doty, Mark in "Myers, Jack and Wojahn, David (editors). ''A Profile of Twentieth-Century American Poetry''. (Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1991).</ref> O'Hara's writing sought to capture in his poetry the immediacy of life, feeling that poetry should be "between two persons instead of two pages."<ref name="OHaraACLSAmericanNatlBio" />

''The Collected Poems of Frank O'Hara'' edited by Donald Allen (Knopf, 1971), the first of several posthumous collections, shared the 1972 [[National Book Award for Poetry]]. [[Brad Gooch]]'s ''City Poet'' is the first substantial biography on the poet.

==Early life and education==
Frank O'Hara, the son of Russell Joseph O'Hara and Katherine (née Broderick), was born on March<!--

He attended [[St. John's High School (Massachusetts)|St. John's High School]]. He grew up believing he had been born in June, but in fact had been born in March - his parents disguised his true date of birth because he was conceived [[out of wedlock]].<ref>[http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&biw=1000&bih=611&q=%22Frank%20O%27Hara%22%20%22march%2027%22%20misinformed&um=1&ie=UTF-8&tbo=u&tbs=bks:1&source=og&sa=N&tab=wp Brad Gooch, ''City Poet: the life and times of Frank O'Hara'', p. 15]</ref> He studied piano at the [[New England Conservatory]] in Boston from 1941 to 1944 and served in the [[Pacific Ocean Theater of World War II|South Pacific]] and [[Japan]] as a [[sonar]]man on the destroyer [[USS Nicholas (DD-449)|USS ''Nicholas'']] during World War II.

With the funding made available to veterans he attended [[Harvard University]], where artist and writer [[Edward Gorey]] was his roommate.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://lithub.com/edward-gorey-frank-ohara-and-harvards-gay-underground/ |title=Edward Gorey, Frank O'Hara and Harvard's Gay Undergroud |last=Dery |first=Mark |date=December 17, 2018 |website=Lit Hub |access-date=March 29, 2021}}</ref> O'Hara was heavily influenced by visual art and by contemporary music, which was his first love (he remained a fine piano player all his life and would shock new partners by suddenly playing swathes of [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]] when visiting them).<ref>{{cite journal |title=Frank O'Hara's Virtuosity |last=Rounds |first=Anne Lovering |journal=Soundings: An Interdisciplinary Journal |volume=100 |issue=1 |date=2017 |pages=29–53 |doi=10.5325/soundings.100.1.0029|s2cid=171596564 }}</ref>  His favorite poets were [[Pierre Reverdy]],<ref>"My Heart is in my pocket it is poems by Pierre Reverdy" (in ''Lunch''),</ref> [[Arthur Rimbaud]], [[Stéphane Mallarmé]], [[Boris Pasternak]], and [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]].<ref name="poets">{{cite web |url=https://poets.org/poet/frank-ohara |title=Frank O'Hara |website=Poets.org |access-date=March 29, 2021}}</ref> While at Harvard, O'Hara met [[John Ashbery]] and began publishing poems in the ''[[Harvard Advocate]]''. Despite his love of music, O'Hara changed his major and graduated from Harvard in 1950 with a degree in English.

He then attended graduate school at the [[University of Michigan]] in [[Ann Arbor]]. While at Michigan, he won a [[Hopwood Award]] and received his master's degree in English literature in 1951.<ref name="poets" />

== Early career ==
In the autumn of 1951, O'Hara moved into an apartment in New York City with [[Joe LeSueur]], who was his roommate and sometime lover for the next 11 years.<ref name="memoir">{{Cite book |title=Joe: A Memoir of Joe Brainard |first=Ron |last=Padgett |publisher=Coffee House Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-56689-159-2 |chapter=Joe LeSueur & Frank O'Hara |page=64 }}</ref> It was during this time that he began teaching at [[The New School]].
[[File:Frank O'Hara Historic Plaque.jpg|thumb|Historic Plaque at 441 East 9th Street where Frank O'Hara lived unveiled by Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation on June 10, 2014]]
O'Hara was active in the art world, working as a reviewer for ''[[Artnews]],'' and in 1960 was assistant curator of painting and sculpture exhibitions for the [[Museum of Modern Art]]. He was a friend of the artists [[Norman Bluhm]], [[Michael Goldberg (painter)|Mike Goldberg]], [[Grace Hartigan]], [[Alex Katz]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Joan Mitchell]], and [[Larry Rivers]].

==Poetry==
While O'Hara's poetry is generally [[autobiography|autobiographical]], it tends to be based on his observations of New York life rather than exploring his past. In his introduction to ''The Collected Poems of Frank O'Hara'', Donald Allen says "that Frank O'Hara tended to think of his poems as a record of his life is apparent in much of his work."<ref name = Collected>Frank O'Hara. ''The Collected Poems of Frank O'Hara''. Ed. Donald Allen. University of California Press. 1995; {{ISBN|0-520-20166-3}}</ref> O'Hara discussed this aspect of his poetry in a statement for Donald Allen's ''[[The New American Poetry 1945–1960|The New American Poetry]]'':

<blockquote>What is happening to me, allowing for lies and exaggerations which I try to avoid, goes into my poems. I don't think my experiences are clarified or made beautiful for myself or anyone else, they are just there in whatever form I can find them. . .My formal "stance" is found at the crossroads where what I know and can't get meets what is left of that I know and can bear without hatred. . .It may be that poetry makes life's nebulous events tangible to me and restores their detail; or conversely that poetry brings forth the intangible quality of incidents which are all too concrete and circumstantial. Or each on specific occasions, or both all the time.<ref>Frank O'Hara. ''The New American Poetry'' (edited by Donald Allen). Grove Press, 1960; {{ISBN|0-394-17225-6}}</ref></blockquote>

His initial time in the Navy, during his basic training at [[Sampson Air Force Base|Sampson Naval Training Center]] in upstate New York, along with earlier years spent at St. John's High School began to shape a distinguished style of solitary observation that would later inform his poems. Immersed in regimented daily routine, first Catholic school then the Navy, he was able to separate himself from the situation and make witty and often singular studies. Sometimes these were cataloged for use in later writing, or, perhaps more often, put into letters. This skill of scrutinizing and recording during the bustle and churn of daily life would, later, be one of the important aspects that shaped O'Hara as an urban poet writing off the cuff.<ref>"Digressions on Some Poems by Frank O'Hara" by Joe LeSueur "City Poet" by Brad Gooch</ref>

Among his friends, O'Hara was known to treat poetry dismissively, as something to be done only in the moment. John Ashbery says he witnessed O'Hara "Dashing the poems off at odd moments – in his office at the Museum of Modern Art, in the street at lunchtime or even in a room full of people – he would then put them away in drawers and cartons and half forget them."<ref name="Collected"/>

In the summer of 1951, O'Hara read a manifesto in ''The Kenyon Review'' written by the poet, novelist and anarchistic social critic [[Paul Goodman]]. In the essay, Goodman argues that the postwar American "advanced guard" writers must articulate the deep-seated, personal disquiet felt across the culture but left unvoiced. The essay encouraged O'Hara to write poetry that was embarrassing in its directness, and even seen as hostile to literary standards then in place. O'Hara's poetry began to erase poetry's cautious border between what is public and what is private.<ref>{{cite web |title=Into a Future of His Choice: Catching Up with Frank O'Hara |first=Tim |last=Keane |url=http://brooklynrail.org/2014/06/art/into-a-future-of-his-choice-catching-up-with-frank-ohara |website=The Brooklyn Rail |access-date=March 29, 2021}}</ref>

In 1959, he wrote a mock manifesto (originally published in the NYC magazine ''Yūgen'' in 1961) called ''Personism: A Manifesto'', in which he explains his position on formal structure: "I don't ... like rhythm, [[assonance]], all that stuff. You just go on your nerve. If someone's chasing you down the street with a knife you just run, you don't turn around and shout, 'Give it up! I was a track star for Mineola Prep.'" He says, in response to academic overemphasis on form, "As for measure and other technical apparatus, that's just common sense: if you're going to buy a pair of pants you want them to be tight enough so everyone will want to go to bed with you. There's nothing metaphysical about it." He claims that on August 27, 1959, while talking to [[LeRoi Jones]], he founded a movement called [[Personism]] which may be "the death of literature as we know it."

He says,

<blockquote>It does not have to do with personality or intimacy, far from it! But to give you a vague idea, one of its minimal aspects is to address itself to one person (other than the poet himself), thus evoking overtones of love without destroying love's life-giving vulgarity, and sustaining the poet's feelings toward the poem while preventing love from distracting him into feeling about the person.<ref name="ReferenceA">Frank O'Hara. "Personism: A Manifesto". ''The Collected Poems of Frank O'Hara'' (edited by Donald Allen). University of California Press. 1995; {{ISBN|0-520-20166-3}}</ref></blockquote>

His poetry shows the influence of [[Abstract Expressionism]], [[Surrealism]], [[Russian poetry]], and poets associated with [[French Symbolism]]. Ashbery says, "The poetry that meant the most to him when he began writing was either French – Rimbaud, Mallarmé, the [[Surrealism|Surrealists]]: poets who speak the language of every day into the reader's dream – or Russian – Pasternak and especially Mayakovsky, for whom he picked up what [[James Schuyler]] has called the 'intimate yell.'"<ref name = "Collected"/> As part of the New York School of poetry, O'Hara to some degree encapsulated the compositional philosophy of [[New York School (art)|New York School]] painters.<ref>William Watkin. ''In the process of poetry: the New York school and the avant-garde''. Bucknell University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-8387-5467-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8387-5467-2}}.</ref><ref>Marjorie Perloff. ''Frank O'Hara: Poet Among Painters''. University of Chicago Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-226-66059-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-226-66059-2}}</ref>

Ashbery says, "Frank O'Hara's concept of the poem as the chronicle of the creative act that produces it was strengthened by his intimate experience of [[Jackson Pollock|Pollock]]'s, [[Franz Kline|Kline]]'s, and [[Willem de Kooning|de Kooning]]'s great paintings of the late '40s and early '50s and of the imaginative realism of painters like [[Jane Freilicher]] and [[Larry Rivers]]."<ref name="Collected"/>

O'Hara was also influenced by [[William Carlos Williams]], so much so that he lists Williams (along with Hart Crane and Walt Whitman) as one of three poets who were "better than the movies."<ref name="ReferenceA"/> According to [[Marjorie Perloff]] in her book ''Frank O'Hara, Poet among Painters'', he and Williams both use everyday language and simple statements split at irregular intervals. Perloff points out the similarities between O'Hara's "Autobiographia Literaria" and Williams's "Invocation and Conclusion". At the end of "Autobiographia Literaria", the speaker says, "And here I am, the/center of all beauty!/writing these poems!/Imagine!" Similarly, Williams at the end of "Invocation and Conclusion" says, "Now look at me!" These lines show a shared interest in the self as an individual who can only be himself in isolation. A similar idea is expressed in a line from Williams's "Danse Russe": "Who shall say I am not/ the happy genius of my household?"<ref>Perloff, pg. 45</ref>

==Personal life==

Frank O'Hara met [[Joe LeSueur]] in 1951, and the two maintained a relationship until 1965, living together on and off from 1955 to 1965.<ref>{{cite web|title=Digressions on Some Poems by Frank O'Hara|url=https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374529048}}</ref>

From 1959 to 1963, the two lived at 441 East 9th St in the East Village.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.villagepreservation.org/event/frank-ohara-lived-herehistoric-plaque-unveiling-and-community-celebrationat-the-former-residence-of-frank-ohara-441-east-9th-street/ |title=Frank O'Hara Lived Here |website=Village Preservation |access-date=March 29, 2021}}</ref> Known throughout his life for his extreme sociability, passion, and warmth, O'Hara had hundreds of friends and lovers throughout his life, many from the New York art and poetry worlds. Soon after arriving in New York, he was employed at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], selling postcards at the admissions desk, and began to write seriously.

O’Hara met longtime partner [[Vincent Warren]] in the summer of 1959. Warren, a Canadian ballet dancer, was the inspiration for several of O'Hara's poems, including "Poem (A la Recherche d’Gertrude Stein)", "Les Luths", "Poem (So many echoes in my head)", and "Having a Coke With You". Warren died on October 25, 2017, 51 years after O'Hara's death.

In the early morning hours of July 24, 1966, O'Hara was struck by a jeep on the [[Fire Island]] beach, after the beach taxi in which he had been riding with a group of friends broke down in the dark.<ref>''City Poet: The Life and Times of Frank O'Hara'' by Brad Gooch p. 459</ref><ref>Belanger, Craig.
