'''Susanna Mary Clarke''' (born 1 November 1959) is an English author known for her debut novel ''[[Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell]]'' (2004), a [[Hugo Award]]-winning [[alternative history]]. Clarke began ''Jonathan Strange'' in 1993 and worked on it during her spare time. For the next decade, she published short stories from the ''Strange'' universe, but it was not until 2003 that [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]] bought her manuscript and began work on its publication. The novel became a best-seller.

Two years later, she published a collection of her short stories, ''[[The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories]]'' (2006). Both Clarke's debut novel and her short stories are [[Setting (narrative)|set]] in a magical England and written in a [[pastiche]] of the styles of 19th-century writers such as [[Jane Austen]] and [[Charles Dickens]]. While ''Strange'' focuses on the relationship of two men, Jonathan Strange and Gilbert Norrell, the stories in ''Ladies'' focus on the power women gain through magic.

Clarke's second novel, ''[[Piranesi (novel)|Piranesi]]'', was published in September 2020, winning the 2021 [[Women's Prize for Fiction]].

=== Early life ===
Clarke was born on 1 November 1959 in [[Nottingham]], England, the eldest daughter of a [[Methodist]] minister and his wife.<ref name=Dewey>{{cite book |first=Joseph |last=Dewey |chapter=Susanna Clarke |title=Guide to Literary Masters and Their Works |publisher=Great Neck Publishing |year=2007 |via=Literary Reference Center ([[EBSCO]])}}</ref> Owing to her father's posts, she spent her childhood in various towns across [[Northern England]] and Scotland,<ref name=Locus/> and enjoyed reading the works of Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[Charles Dickens]], and [[Jane Austen]].<ref name=Dewey/> She studied [[philosophy, politics, and economics]] at [[St Hilda's College, Oxford]],<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T7pVTz46T3cC&pg=PA110|title=Encyclopedia of British Writers, 1800 to the Present|volume=2|first1=George|last1=Stade|first2=Karen|last2=Karbiener|date=12 May 2010|page=110|isbn=9781438116891}}</ref> receiving her degree in 1981.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.de/Autor/Susanna-Clarke/p691467.rhd|title=Susanna Clarke (Autor) - Bücher}}</ref>

For eight years, she worked in publishing at [[Quarto Publishing|Quarto]] and [[Gordon Fraser (publisher)|Gordon Fraser]].<ref name=Locus/> She spent two years teaching English as a foreign language in [[Turin]], Italy and [[Bilbao]], Spain. She returned to England in 1992 and spent the rest of that year in [[County Durham]], in a house that looked out over the North Sea.<ref name="bloomsbury_a">{{cite web |url=http://bloomsbury.com/Susanna-Clarke/authors/506 |title=Susanna Clarke |website=Bloomsbury.com |access-date=28 October 2017}}</ref> There she began working on her first novel, ''Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell.''<ref name="bloomsbury_a" /> In 1993, she was hired by [[Simon & Schuster]] in [[Cambridge]] to edit cookbooks, a job she kept for the next ten years.<ref name=Locus>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.locusmag.com/2005/Issues/04Clarke.html |title=The Three Susanna Clarkes |magazine=[[Locus (magazine)|Locus]] |date=April 2005 |url-access=subscription |access-date=17 March 2009}}</ref>

=== ''Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell'' ===
{{main|Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell}}
Clarke first developed the idea for ''Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell'' while she was teaching in Bilbao: "I had a kind of waking dream&nbsp;...&nbsp;about a man in 18th-century clothes in a place rather like Venice, talking to some English tourists. And I felt strongly that he had some sort of magical background&nbsp;– he'd been dabbling in magic, and something had gone badly wrong."<ref name=Grossman>{{cite magazine |first=Lev |last=Grossman |url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,678627,00.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121216121422/http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,678627,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=16 December 2012 |title=Of Magic and Men |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=8 August 2004 |access-date=5 January 2009}}</ref> She had also recently reread [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and afterwards was inspired to "[try] writing a novel of magic and fantasy".<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Jessica |last=Stockton |url=http://reviews.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/authors/interviews/article/21286-harry-potter-meets-history.html |title=Harry Potter Meets History |magazine=[[Publishers Weekly]] |date=12 July 2004 |via=[[LexisNexis]] |url-access=subscription |access-date=20 May 2009}}</ref>

After she returned from Spain in 1993, Clarke began to think seriously about writing her novel. She signed up for a five-day fantasy and science-fiction writing workshop, co-taught by science fiction and fantasy writers [[Colin Greenland]] and [[Geoff Ryman]]. The students were expected to prepare a short story before attending, but Clarke only had "bundles" of material for her novel. From this she extracted "[[The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories|The Ladies of Grace Adieu]]", a [[fairy tale]] about three women secretly practising magic who are discovered by the famous Jonathan Strange.<ref name=Hodgman>{{cite news |first=John |last=Hodgman |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/01/magazine/01CLARKE.html?ex=1249099200&en=2fea0b3cbfbd17d9&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&pagewanted=all |title=Susanna Clarke's Magic Book |magazine=[[The New York Times Magazine]] |date=1 August 2004 |access-date=5 January 2009}}</ref> Greenland was so impressed with the story that, without Clarke's knowledge, he sent an excerpt to his friend, the fantasy writer [[Neil Gaiman]]. Gaiman later said, "It was terrifying from my point of view to read this first short story that had so much assurance&nbsp;...&nbsp;It was like watching someone sit down to play the piano for the first time and she plays a sonata."<ref name=Hodgman/> Gaiman showed the story to his friend, science-fiction writer and editor [[Patrick Nielsen Hayden]]. Clarke learned of these events when Nielsen Hayden called and offered to publish her story in his anthology ''[[Starlight (anthology series)|Starlight 1]]'' (1996), which featured pieces by well-regarded science-fiction and fantasy writers.<ref name=Hodgman/> She accepted, and the book won the [[World Fantasy Award]] for best anthology in 1997.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldfantasy.org/awards/awardslist.html |title=Award Winners & Nominees: 2007 World Fantasy Awards Ballot |website=World Fantasy Awards |access-date=13 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090730185710/http://www.worldfantasy.org/awards/awardslist.html |archive-date=30 July 2009}}</ref>

Clarke spent the next ten years working on the novel in her spare time.<ref name=WGrossman>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3625070/Ten-years-but-Susannas-book-is-worth-the-wait.html |first=Wendy |last=Grossman |title=Ten years&nbsp;— but Susanna's book is worth the wait |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=7 October 2004 |access-date=5 January 2009}}</ref> She also published stories in ''Starlight 2'' (1998) and ''Starlight 3'' (2001); according to ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', her work was known and appreciated by a small group of fantasy fans and critics on the internet.<ref name=Hodgman/> Overall, she published seven short stories in anthologies. "Mr Simonelli, or The Fairy Widower" was shortlisted for a World Fantasy Award in 2001.<ref name=Bloomsbury>{{cite web |url=http://www.jonathanstrange.com/copy.asp?s=1 |title=About Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell |website=JonathanStrange.com |access-date=12 April 2009}}</ref>

Clarke was never sure if she would finish her novel or if it would be published.<ref name=WGrossman/> Clarke tried to write for three hours each day, beginning at 5:30&nbsp;am, but struggled to keep this schedule. Rather than writing the novel from beginning to end, she wrote in fragments and attempted to stitch them together.<ref name=Rose/> Clarke, admitting that the project was for herself and not for the reader,<ref name=Silver1>{{cite web |first=Steven H. |last=Silver |url=http://www.sfsite.com/02a/su193.htm |title=An Interview of Susanna Clarke, Part 1 |website=sfsite.com |date=October 2004 |access-date=25 January 2009}}</ref> "clung to this method" "because I felt that if I went back and started at the beginning, [the novel] would lack depth, and I would just be skimming the surface of what I could do. But if I had known it was going to take me ten years, I would never have begun. I was buoyed up by thinking that I would finish it next year, or the year after next."<ref name=Rose/> Clarke and Greenland fell in love while she was writing the novel and moved in together.<ref name=Hodgman/>

Around 2001, Clarke "had begun to despair", and started looking for someone to help her finish and sell the book.<ref name=Hodgman/> [[Giles Gordon]] became her first [[literary agent]] and sold the unfinished manuscript to [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]] in early 2003, after two publishers rejected it as unmarketable.<ref name=Rose>{{cite news |first=Hilary |last=Rose |title=Her dark materials |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=2 October 2004 |via=LexisNexis}}</ref> Bloomsbury were so sure the novel would be a success that they offered Clarke a £1&nbsp;million advance.<ref name=Craig>{{cite magazine |first=Amanda |last=Craig |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/node/160636 |title=With the fairies |magazine=[[New Statesman]] |date=27 September 2004 |access-date=5 January 2009}}</ref> They printed 250,000 hardcover copies simultaneously in the United States, Britain, and Germany.

In 2006, Clarke published a collection of eight [[fairy tales]] presented as the work of several different writers, seven of which had been previously anthologized.<ref name=Zipp>{{cite magazine |first=Yvonne |last=Zipp |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/1031/p13s02-bogn.html |title=All the faerie young ladies |magazine=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |date=31 October 2006 |access-date=7 April 2009}}</ref><ref name=Luscombe>{{cite news |first=Karen |last=Luscombe |url=https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/arts/youll-believe-in-magic/article733584/ |title=You'll believe in magic |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=23 December 2006 |access-date=7 April 2009}}</ref><ref name=Morrissy>{{cite news |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/flitting-into-the-world-of-faerie-1.1018912 |first=Mary |last=Morrissy |title=Flitting into the world of Faerie |newspaper=[[The Irish Times]] |date=21 October 2006 |access-date=9 April 2009}}</ref> The volume's focus on "female mastery of the dark arts" is reflected in the ladies of Grace Adieu's magical abilities and the prominent role needlework plays in saving the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] and [[Mary, Queen of Scots]].<ref name=Montgomery>{{cite news |first=Isobel |last=Montgomery |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/sep/08/featuresreviews.guardianreview6 |title=Stitches in time |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=8 September 2007 |access-date=7 April 2009}}</ref> The collection is a "sly, frequently comical, feminist revision" of ''Jonathan Strange''.<ref name=Collins-Hughes>{{cite news |first=Laura |last=Collins-Hughes |title=Clarke's protagonist seen in less flattering light in 'Ladies' |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=10 November 2006 |via=Access World News}}</ref> In tone, the stories are similar to the novel—"nearly every one of them is told in a lucid, frequently deadpan, bedtime-story voice strikingly similar to the voice that narrates the novel."<ref name=Collins-Hughes/>

The title story, "The Ladies of Grace Adieu", is set in early 19th-century [[Gloucestershire]] and concerns the friendship of three young women, Cassandra Parbringer, Miss Tobias, and Mrs. Fields. Though the events of the story do not actually appear in ''Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell'', they are referenced in a footnote in Chapter 43. Clarke has said, "For a long time it was my hope that these three ladies should eventually find a place in&nbsp;...&nbsp;the novel&nbsp;...&nbsp;I decided there was no place for them&nbsp;...&nbsp;I deliberately kept women to the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]] in the interests of authenticity&nbsp;...&nbsp;it was important that real and alternate history appeared to have converged. This meant that I needed to write the women and the servants, as far as possible, as they would have been written in a 19th-century novel."<ref name=Steele>{{cite news |first=Colin |last=Steele |title=Literary journey to faerie realms |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |date=27 January 2007 |via=Lexis Nexis}}</ref> Reviewers highlighted this tale, one calling it "the most striking story" of the collection and "a staunchly feminist take on power relations".<ref name=Lalumiere>{{cite news |first=Claude |last=Lalumiere |title=Stories mix everyday and magic realms |newspaper=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]] |date=20 January 2007 |via=LexisNexis}}</ref> In her review of the volume in ''[[Strange Horizons]]'', Victoria Hoyle writes that "there is something incredibly precise, clean, and cold about Clarke's portrayal of 'women's magic' in this story (and throughout the collection)—it is urgent and desperate, but it is also natural and in the course of things."<ref name=Hoyle>{{cite magazine |first=Victoria |last=Hoyle |url=http://www.strangehorizons.com/reviews/2006/11/the_ladies_of_g.shtml |title=Review: 'The Ladies of Grace Adieu' by Susanna Clarke |magazine=[[Strange Horizons]] |date=20 November 2006 |access-date=10 April 2009}}</ref>

The collection received many positive reviews, though some critics compared the short stories unfavourably with the highly acclaimed and more substantial ''Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell''. Hoyle wrote in her review that "the stories&nbsp;...&nbsp;are consistently subtle and enchanting, and as charismatic as any reader could wish, but, while the collection has the panache of the novel, it lacks its glorious self-possession."<ref name=Hoyle/>

When she began writing her next book, Clarke was living in Cambridge with her partner, the science fiction novelist and reviewer [[Colin Greenland]].<ref name=Bloomsbury/> They met when she took his fantasy writing course.<ref name=jordan>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/12/susanna-clarke-i-was-cut-off-from-the-world-bound-in-one-place-by-illness|title=Susanna Clarke: 'I was cut off from the world, bound in one place by illness'|first=Justine|last=Jordan|date=20 September 2020}}</ref> She was, in 2004, working on a book that begins a few years after ''Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell'' ends and which would involve characters who, as Clarke said, are "a bit lower down the social scale".<ref name=Silver1/> She commented in 2005 and 2007<ref>{{cite web |url=http://foem.org.uk/ |title=Susanna Clarke responds to your questions... |date=10 January 2007 |website=The Friends of English Magic |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070110215122/http://foem.org.uk/ |archive-date=10 January 2007}}</ref> that progress on the book had been slowed by her ill health.<ref>{{cite web |last=Goodwin |first=Geoffrey |title=An Interview with Susanna Clarke |url=http://www.bookslut.com/features/2005_09_006537.php |website=Bookslut |access-date=29 June 2015}}</ref> In 2006 it was reported that she suffered from [[chronic fatigue syndrome]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/galleycat/susanna-clarke-cancels-book-tour/3691|title=Susanna Clarke cancels book tour|website=Adweek|access-date=22 August 2018}}</ref> Clarke found that writing the sequel to ''Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell'' was becoming too complex considering her illness, and she returned instead to an earlier project with fewer characters and requiring less research – which became her second novel. While writing this book she moved to Derbyshire.<ref name=jordan/>

In September 2019, ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' reported that Clarke's second novel would be titled ''Piranesi'' and published in September 2020 by Bloomsbury. Quoting their press release, "A Bloomsbury spokesperson said the novel is set in 'a richly imagined, very unusual world.' The title character lives in a place called the House and is needed by his friend, the Other, to work on a scientific project. The publisher went on: 'Piranesi records his findings in his journal. Then messages begin to appear; all is not what it seems. A terrible truth unravels as evidence emerges of another person and perhaps even another world outside the House’s walls.{{'"}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Book Deals: Week of September 30, 2019 |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/book-deals/article/81293-book-deals-week-of-september-30-2019.html |website=Publishers Weekly |date=27 September 2019 |access-date=28 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Flood |first=Alison |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/30/jonathan-strange-and-mr-norrell-author-return-susanna-clarke-piranesi |title=Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell author to return after 16-year gap |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=30 September 2019 |access-date=30 September 2019}}</ref> ''Piranesi'' was published on 15 September 2020 by Bloomsbury.
