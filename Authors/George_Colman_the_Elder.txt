'''George Colman''' (April 1732 – 14 August 1794) was an English [[dramatist]] and [[essayist]], usually called "'''the Elder'''", and sometimes "'''George the First'''", to distinguish him from his son, [[George Colman the Younger]]. He was also a theatre owner.

==Early life==
He was born in [[Florence]], where his father was stationed as British [[Resident Minister]] (diplomatic envoy) at the court of the Grand duke of [[Tuscany]]. Colman's father died within a year of his son's birth, and the boy's education was undertaken by [[William Pulteney, 1st earl of Bath|William Pulteney]], afterwards Lord Bath, whose wife was Mrs Colman's sister. After attending a private school in [[Marylebone]], George was sent to [[Westminster School]].

Colman left school in due course for [[Christ Church, Oxford]]. There he made the acquaintance of [[Bonnell Thornton]], the parodist, and together they founded ''[[The Connoisseur (newspaper)|The Connoisseur]]'' (1754–1756), a periodical which although it reached its 140th number, "wanted weight," as [[Samuel Johnson|Johnson]] said. He left Oxford after taking his degree in 1755, and having been entered at [[Lincoln's Inn]] before his return to London, he was called to the bar in 1757. A friendship formed with [[David Garrick]] did not help his career as a barrister, but he continued to practise until the death of Lord Bath, out of respect for his wishes.

==Plays==
In 1760, Colman produced his first play, ''[[Polly Honeycomb]]'', which met with great success. In 1761, ''[[The Jealous Wife]]'', a comedy partly founded on ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]'', made Colman famous. The death of Lord Bath in 1764 placed him in possession of independent means. In 1765, his metrical translation of the plays of [[Terence]] appeared, and in 1766, he produced ''[[The Clandestine Marriage]]'', jointly with [[David Garrick|Garrick]], whose refusal to take the part of Lord Ogleby led to a quarrel between the two authors. In the next year he purchased a fourth share in the [[Covent Garden Theatre]], a step which is said to have induced General Pulteney to revoke a will by which he had left Colman large estates. The general, who died in that year, did, however, leave him a considerable annuity. There was a riot at the third performance of his play ''[[The Oxonian in Town]]'' on 9 November 1767, apparently sparked by a [[claque]] of card-sharpers.<ref>''The Diary of Sylas Neville 1767–1788'', ed. Basil Cozens-Hardy. (London, OUP, 1950), p. 27.</ref>

==Theatre ownership==
Colman was acting manager of Covent Garden for seven years, and during that period he produced several "adapted" plays of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. He directed [[Mary Bulkley]], [[Ann Catley]] and others in the première of ''[[She Stoops to Conquer]]'' there in 1773.<ref>[https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001578/18961031/023/0008 ''Illustrated London News'', Saturday 31 October 1896 p8 col2-3: Chapter XII]</ref> In 1768 he was elected to the [[The Club (dining club)|Literary Club]], then nominally consisting of twelve members. In 1771 [[Thomas Arne]]'s [[masque]] ''[[The Fairy Prince]]'' premièred at Covent Garden, for which Colman wrote the [[libretto]]. In 1774 he sold to James Leake his share in the playhouse, which had involved him in much litigation with his partners, and three years later purchased the little theatre in [[the Haymarket]] from [[Samuel Foote]], then broken in health and spirits. Colman was attacked by paralysis in 1785; in 1789 his brain became affected, and he died on 14 August 1794. He was buried in [[St Mary Abbots|Kensington Church]].<ref>[[Dictionary of National Biography]]</ref>

==Other works==
Besides the works already cited, Colman was author of adaptations of [[Francis Beaumont|Beaumont]] and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|Fletcher]]'s ''[[Bonduca]]'', [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[Epicoene, or the Silent Woman|Epicoene]]'' and ''[[Volpone]]'', [[John Milton|Milton]]'s ''[[Comus (John Milton)|Comus]]'', and of other plays. He also produced an edition of the works of Beaumont and Fletcher (1778), a version of the ''[[Ars Poëtica]]'' of [[Horace]], an excellent translation from the ''Mercator'' of [[Plautus]] for [[Bonnell Thornton]]'s edition (1769–1772), some thirty plays, and many parodies and occasional pieces. An incomplete edition of his dramatic works was published in 1777 in four volumes.<ref>Olive Baldwin and Thelma Wilson, "Colman, George, the elder (baptised 1732, d. 1794)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Oxford, UK: OUP, 2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5976, Retrieved 29 January 2017, pay-walled.]</ref>
