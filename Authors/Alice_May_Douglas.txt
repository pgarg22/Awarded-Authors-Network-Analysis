'''Alice May Douglas''' (June 28, 1865 â€“ January 6, 1943) was an American author of poetry, [[children's literature]], and non-fiction, as well as a newspaper editor.

==Early years==
Alice May Douglas was born in [[Bath, Maine]], June 28, 1865, which remained her residence for the remainder of her life.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=255}}<ref name="bio">{{cite news |title=Douglas, Alice May, Maine Biography File |url=http://digitalmaine.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1222&context=maine_writers_correspondence |access-date=31 July 2018 |publisher=[[Sun Journal (Lewiston, Maine)|Lewiston Journal]] |date=May 10, 1930}}</ref> She had no formal training in writing, saying instead that "All my poems and stories are the result of inspiration."<ref name="bio"/>

==Career==
She began her career as an author at the age of eleven years, when her first published article appeared among the children's productions of ''[[St. Nicholas Magazine]]''. The reading of ''[[Little Women]]'' at the age of thirteen marked an epoch in her life. She determined to be an author like [[Little Women#Josephine "Jo" March|Jo]], and, like her, send for publication a composition she wrote to test her chances of getting published. Consequently, she sent a poem pertaining to a little sister, who shortly before death was seen throwing kisses to God. The ''[[The Progressive Christian|Zion's Herald]]''. to which the poem was sent, published it, and from that time, Douglas was a constant contributor to the press.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=255}}

Douglas was also engaged in editorial work on two monthly papers, the ''Pacific Banner'' and the ''Acorn''. Her first volume of poems was ''Phlox'' (Bath, Maine, 1888). This was followed during the same year by a second volume, ''May Flowers'' (Bath, Maine, 1888). Then she published ''Gems Without Polish'' (New York, 1890). She next wrote two juvenile books, one for boys and the other for girls, in the interest of the [[Lend-A-Hand Club]]s. Most of her books first appeared as serials. Among them were ''Jewel Gatherers'', ''Quaker John in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]'', ''How the Little Cousins Formed a Museum'', ''The Peace-Makers'', and ''Self-exiled from Russia'', a story of the [[Mennonites]].{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=256}}

Douglas was State superintendent of the department of peace and arbitration of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]]. She also assisted the national peace department of that organization, by preparing much of its necessary literature and by founding a peace band for children, which had branches in Palestine and Australia.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=256}}

==Personal life==
By religion, she was [[Methodism|Methodist]]. Douglas died January 6, 1943.{{sfn|Roberts|1991|p=81}}<ref>{{cite web |last1=Warner |first1=C.D. |editor1-last=Ayres |editor1-first=H.
