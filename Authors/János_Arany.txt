==Biography==
He was born in Nagyszalonta, [[Bihar (county)|Bihar county]], [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526–1867)|Kingdom of Hungary]], [[Austrian Empire]]. He was the youngest of ten children, but because of [[tuberculosis]] running in the family, only two of them lived beyond childhood. At the time of his birth, his older sister Sára was already married and his parents, György Arany and Sára Megyeri, were 60 and 44 years old, respectively. János Arany learned to read and write early on, and was reported to read anything he could find in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Latin]]. Since his parents needed support early in Arany's life, he began working at the age of 14 as an associate teacher.

From 1833 he attended the [[University of Debrecen|Reformed College]] of [[Debrecen]] where he studied [[German language|German]] and [[French language|French]], though he quickly became tired of scholarly life, and temporarily joined an acting troupe. Later on, he worked in Nagyszalonta, [[Debrecen]], and [[Budapest]] as teacher, newspaper editor, and in various clerk positions.

In 1840 he married {{ill|Julianna Ercsey|hu|Ercsey Julianna}} (1816–1885). They had two children, Julianna, whose early death by pneumonia devastated the poet, and {{ill|László Arany (poet)|hu|Arany László (költő)|lt=László}}, who also became a poet and a collector of Hungarian [[Folklore|folktales]].

In 1847, he won the competition of the [[Kisfaludy Society]] with his writing, "''Az elveszett alkotmány''" ("''The lost constitution''" in English).

After ''[[Toldi trilogy|Toldi]]'', one of his most famous works, was published, he and [[Sándor Petőfi]] became close friends (see their letters: To János Arany by Petőfi and Reply to Petőfi by Arany). Petőfi's death in the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]] had a great impact on him.

He was employed as a teacher in [[Nagykőrös]] where the local museum is named after him.

Arany was elected a member of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] in 1858. He was the secretary-general of the Academy from 1865. Also, he was elected director of the [[Kisfaludy Society]], the greatest literary association of Hungary.

The early death of his daughter, Julianna in 1865 marked the beginning of Arany's hiatus as a poet. He did not write any original pieces until the summer of 1877, when he began working on his poetic cycle entitled ''Őszikék'' which is substantially different from his previous works, concerning themes like elderliness, or the imminence of death.

Arany died in [[Budapest]] on 22 October 1882.

==Works==
He translated three dramas of [[Shakespeare]] into Hungarian, ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', ''[[Hamlet]]'' and ''[[The Life and Death of King John|King John]]'', and they are considered to be some of the greatest translations into Hungarian in history; he also helped other Hungarian translators with his comments, and translated works by [[Aristophanes]], [[Mikhail Lermontov]], [[Aleksandr Pushkin]], and [[Molière]].

The epic poetry of János Arany presents the legendary and historical past of his nation. ''The Death of King Buda'' (1864), the first part of a projected Hun trilogy is one of the best narrative poems in Hungarian literature. The other parts of the trilogy (''Ildikó'', and ''Prince Csaba'') are unfinished. The proposed trilogy used [[Arnold Ipolyi]]'s ''Magyar Mythologia'' as a source.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Szörényi |first1=László Szörényi |editor1-last=Bak |editor1-first=János M. |editor2-last=Geary |editor2-first=Patrick J. |editor3-last=Klaniczay |editor3-first=Gábor |title=Manufacturing a Past for the Present: Forgery and Authenticity in Medievalist Texts and Objects in Nineteenth-Century Europe |date=2014 |publisher=Brill |pages=81–95 |chapter-url=https://brill.com/abstract/book/edcoll/9789004276819/B9789004276819_005.xml |chapter=János Arany's Csaba Trilogy and Arnold Ipolyi's Hungarian Mythology|doi=10.1163/9789004276819_005 |isbn=9789004276819 }}</ref> Arany's works have shaped the popular impression of Hungarian history (at the expense of the actual historical record).<ref>

One of his most famous poems is ''A Walesi Bárdok'' ([[The Bards of Wales]]). Arany wrote this poem when [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] visited Hungary for the first time after defeating the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]]. Originally Arany was asked to write a poem to praise the Emperor but he wrote a piece concerning the campaigns of [[Edward I of England]] to subjugate the Welsh and trample over their culture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/tale-welsh-bards-massacre-taught-1839294|title=Tale of Welsh bards' massacre taught to generations... in Hungary|date=2013}}</ref> Arany was drawing a parallel here with Austria's treatment of Hungary and the Hungarians.

His poem ''Dante'' is one of those few verses in Western literature that can seize concisely the whole meaning and transcendency of human life ([[Peter Ustinov]] – British actor).

Some remarkable pieces of Arany's works have been translated to English by [[Watson Kirkconnell]]<ref>{{cite book|first=Watson |last=Kirkconnell|author-link=Watson Kirkconnell|title=The Magyar Muse – An Anthology of Hungarian Poetry 1400–1932|publisher=Kanadai Magyar Újság Press |year=1933}}</ref> and by [[Edward Dundas Butler]].<ref>Czigány, L.  Butler, Edward Dundas (1842–1919), linguist and librarian. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Retrieved 23 May. 2021, from https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-52382.</ref>

Arany is today considered one of the greatest Hungarian poets beside [[Sándor Petőfi]], [[Endre Ady]], [[Miklós Radnóti]] and [[Attila József]].

==Legacy==
The first scientific monograph on Arany was written by [[Frigyes Riedl]].

The ''[[Arany-album]]'', a [[Folk metal]] album by Hungarian band [[Dalriada (band)|Dalriada]] is based on popular works by Arany. It won the 2009 HangSúly Hungarian Metal Awards out of 70 contestants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kultura.hu/main.php?folderID=951&articleID=298019&ctag=&iid=11 |title=Dalriada készítette az év metal lemezét |language=hu |date=10 March 2010 |work=Kultúra.hu |publisher=Hungarian Ministry of National Resources |access-date=2010-08-08 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721112302/http://www.kultura.hu/main.php?folderID=951&articleID=298019&ctag=&iid=11 |archive-date=21 July 2011 }}</ref>
