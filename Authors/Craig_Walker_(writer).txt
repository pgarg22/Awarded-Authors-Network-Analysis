From 1997 till 2007, Walker served as artistic director of [[Theatre Kingston]], a company for which he has directed many productions including his own ''Finnegans Wake: a dream play'' (based on the novel ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' by [[James Joyce]]), which played in both Kingston and Toronto in 2001, and [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[The Oresteia]]'', which was performed with ''[[Proteus (play)|Proteus]]'', a satyr play Walker wrote himself to replace the one that had originally followed the trilogy, but had been lost since the 5th century BCE. In 2002, Walker wrote the book, music and lyrics for ''Chantecler: a musical'' (based loosely on a verse play by [[Edmond Rostand]]). More recently, he has worked as an actor and director with the [[St. Lawrence Shakespeare Festival]] in Prescott, Ontario.
