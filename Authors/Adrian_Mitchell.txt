A former journalist, he became a noted figure on the British [[Left-wing politics|Left]]. For almost half a century he was the foremost poet of the country's [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] movement. The critic [[Kenneth Tynan]] called him "the British [[Vladimir Mayakovsky|Mayakovsky]]".<ref name="writers">{{Cite web|url=http://www.adrianmitchell.co.uk/#/on-adrian-mitchell/4538917125 |title=Words for Adrian... |access-date=26 December 2014 |publisher=Adrian Mitchell's website |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226103049/http://www.adrianmitchell.co.uk/ |archive-date=26 December 2014 }}<!-- --></ref>

Mitchell sought in his work to counteract the implications of his own assertion that, "Most people ignore most poetry because most poetry ignores most people."<ref name="indyobit">{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/adrian-mitchell-poet-and-playwright-whose-work-was-driven-by-his-pacifist-politics-1208517.html |access-date=5 January 2009 |title=Adrian Mitchell: Poet and playwright whose work was driven by his pacifist politics |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=23 December 2008 | location=London| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081226045726/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/adrian-mitchell-poet-and-playwright-whose-work-was-driven-by-his-pacifist-politics-1208517.html| archive-date= 26 December 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>

Ever inspired by the example of his own favourite poet and precursor [[William Blake]], about whom he wrote the acclaimed ''Tyger'' for the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]], his often angry output swirled from [[anarchism|anarchistic]] [[anti-war]] satire, through [[love poetry]] to, increasingly, stories and poems for children. He also wrote [[librettos]]. The Poetry Archive identified his creative yield as hugely prolific.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.poetryarchive.org/poetryarchive/singlePoet.do?poetId=40 |title=Poetry Archive, Adrian Mitchell |access-date=22 December 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430150555/http://www.poetryarchive.org/poetryarchive/singlePoet.do?poetId=40 |archive-date=30 April 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

''[[The Times]]'' said that Mitchell's had been a "forthright voice often laced with tenderness." His poems on such topics as [[nuclear war]], [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], prisons and racism had become "part of the folklore of the Left. His work was often read and sung at [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations and rallies]]."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article5381267.ece |title=Adrian Mitchell, 'Shadow Poet Laureate', dies aged 76 |access-date=5 January 2009 |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=22 December 2008 |author=Kaya Burgess | location=London|author-link=Kaya Burgess }}</ref>

== Biography ==

=== Early life and career ===
Adrian Mitchell was born near [[Hampstead Heath]], north London. His mother, Kathleen Fabian, was a [[Friedrich Fröbel|Fröbel]]-trained nursery school teacher and his father, Jock Mitchell, a research chemist from [[Cupar]] in Fife. He was educated at [[Monkton Combe School]] in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]. He then went to [[Greenways School]], at [[Ashton Gifford House]] in Wiltshire, run at the time by a friend of his mother. This, said Mitchell, was "a school in Heaven, where my first play, ''The Animals' Brains Trust'', was staged when I was nine to my great satisfaction."<ref name="mylife">{{Cite web|url=http://www.adrianmitchell.co.uk/#/biography/4538662557 |title=My Life |access-date=26 December 2014 |publisher=Adrian Mitchell's website |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226103049/http://www.adrianmitchell.co.uk/ |archive-date=26 December 2014 }}<!-- --></ref>

His schooling was completed as a boarder at [[Dauntsey's School]], after which he did his [[National Service]] in the [[RAF]]. He commented that this "confirmed (his) natural pacificism".<ref name="mylife" /> He went on to study English at [[Christ Church, Oxford]], where he was taught by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s son. He became chairman of the university's poetry society and the literary editor of [[Isis magazine|''Isis'' magazine]].<ref name="nytimes">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/23/books/23mitchell.html |title=Adrian Mitchell, British Poetry's Voice of the Left, Dies at 76 |access-date=5 January 2009 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=23 December 2008 |first=William |last=Grimes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509024822/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/23/books/23mitchell.html |archive-date=9 May 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> On graduating Mitchell got a job as a reporter on the ''[[Oxford Mail]]'' and, later, at the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' in London.<ref name="indyobit" /> He later wrote of this period:

{{Quote
|text=Inheriting enough money to live on for a year, I wrote my first novel and my first TV play. Soon afterwards I became a freelance journalist, writing about pop music for the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' and TV for the pre-tabloid ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|Sun]]'' and the ''[[Sunday Times]]''. I quit journalism in the mid-Sixties and since then have been a free-falling poet, playwright and writer of stories.<ref name="mylife" />
}}

=== Career ===

Mitchell gave frequent public readings, particularly for left-wing causes. Satire was his speciality. Commissioned to write a poem about [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] and his special relationship (as [[Prince of Wales]]) with the people of Wales, his measured response was short and to the point: "[[House of Windsor|Royalty]] is a [[neurosis]]. Get well soon."

[[File:Mitchell poems 1953-1984.jpg|left|thumb|upright|''Heart on the Left'': [[Ralph Steadman]]'s blood-splattered cover for Mitchell's ''Poems 1953–1984'']]

In "Loose Leaf Poem", from ''Ride the Nightmare'', he wrote:

:''My brain socialist''
:''My heart anarchist''
:''My eyes pacifist''
:''My blood revolutionary''<ref>David Walsh, [http://www.wsws.org/articles/2008/dec2008/mitc-d24.shtml "To the Memory of Adrian Mitchell"], World Socialist Web Site, 24 December 2008.</ref>

Mitchell was in the habit of stipulating in any preface to his collections: "None of the work in this book is to be used in connection with any [[Test (assessment)|examination]] whatsoever." His best-known poem, "To Whom It May Concern", was his bitterly sarcastic reaction to the televised horrors of the Vietnam War. The poem begins:

:''I was run over by the truth one day.''
:''Ever since the accident I’ve walked this way''
:''So stick my legs in plaster''
:''Tell me lies about Vietnam''

He first read it to thousands of [[nuclear disarmament]] protesters who, having marched through central London on [[CND]]'s first new format one-day Easter March, finally crammed into [[Trafalgar Square]] on the afternoon of Easter Day 1964. As Mitchell delivered his lines from the pavement in front of the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]], angry demonstrators in the square below scuffled with police. Over the years he updated the poem to take into account recent events.<ref name="nytimes" />

In 1972 he confronted then-prime minister [[Edward Heath]] about [[United Kingdom and weapons of mass destruction#Biological weapons|germ warfare]] and the [[the Troubles|war in Northern Ireland]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/4229932/Adrian-Mitchell.html|title=Adrian Mitchell|date=13 January 2009|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=3 August 2013}}</ref>

His poem "Victor Jara" was set to music by [[Arlo Guthrie]] and included on his 1976 album ''[[Amigo (Arlo Guthrie album)|Amigo]]''.

He was later responsible for the well-respected [[Adaptations of The Chronicles of Narnia|stage adaptation]] of ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'', a production of the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] that premiered in November 1998.

According to writer Jan Woolf, "He never let up. Most calls—'Can you do this one, Adrian?'—were answered, 'Sure, I'll be there.' His reading of 'Tell Me Lies' at a City Hall benefit just before the 2003 [[Iraq War|invasion of Iraq]] was electrifying. Of course, he couldn't stop that war, but he performed as if he could."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/dec/24/adrian-mitchell-poetry |title=Obituary Letter: Adrian Mitchell |access-date=5 January 2009 |last=Woolf |first=Jan |date=24 December 2003 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | location=London}}</ref>

One [[Remembrance Sunday]] he laid the [[Peace Pledge Union]]'s [[White Poppy]] wreath on the [[Cenotaph]] in [[Whitehall]]. On one International [[Conscientious Objectors]]' Day he read a poem at the ceremony at the [[Conscientious Objectors Commemorative Stone]] in [[Tavistock Square]] in London.

Fellow writers could be effusive in their tributes. [[John Berger]] said that, "Against the present British state he opposes a kind of revolutionary [[populism]], [[bawdiness]], [[wit]] and the tenderness sometimes to be found between animals." [[Angela Carter]] once wrote that he was "a joyous, acrid and demotic tumbling lyricist [[Pied Piper of Hamelin|Pied Piper]], determinedly singing us away from catastrophe." [[Ted Hughes]]: "In the world of verse for children, nobody has produced more surprising verse or more genuinely inspired fun than Adrian Mitchell."<ref name="writers" />

Mitchell died at the age of 76 in a North London hospital from a suspected heart attack. For two months he had been suffering from [[pneumonia]]. Two days earlier he had completed what turned out to be his last poem, "My Literary Career So Far". He intended it as a Christmas gift to "all the friends, family and animals he loved".

"Adrian", said fellow poet [[Michael Rosen]], "was a socialist and a [[pacifist]] who believed, like William Blake, that everything human was ''[[holy]]''. That's to say he celebrated a love of life with the same fervour that he attacked those who crushed life. He did this through his poetry, his plays, his song lyrics and his own performances. Through this huge body of work, he was able to raise the spirits of his audiences, in turn exciting, inspiring, saddening and enthusing them.... He has sung, chanted, whispered and shouted his poems in every kind of place imaginable, urging us to love our lives, love our minds and bodies and to fight against [[tyranny]], [[oppression]] and exploitation."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/art.php?id=16758 |title=Adrian Mitchell 1932–2008 |access-date=5 January 2009 |last=Rosen |first=Michael |author-link=Michael Rosen |date=21 December 2003 |newspaper=[[Socialist Worker]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129232050/http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/art.php?id=16758 |archive-date=29 January 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 2009, [[Frances Lincoln Publishers|Frances Lincoln Children's Books]] published an adaptation of [[Ovid]]: ''Shapeshifters: tales from Ovid's Metamorphoses'', written by Mitchell and illustrated by [[Alan Lee (illustrator)|Alan Lee]].<ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/title/shapeshifters-tales-from-ovids-metamorphoses/oclc/645769357 "Shapeshifters: tales from Ovid's ''Metamorphoses''"].

=== Family ===

Mitchell is survived by his wife, the actress Celia Hewitt, whose bookshop, Ripping Yarns, was<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.camdenreview.com/node/990152 |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113112809/http://www.camdenreview.com/node/990152 |archive-date=13 November 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> in [[Highgate]], and their two daughters Sasha and Beattie. He also has two sons and a daughter from his previous marriage to Maureen Bush: Briony, Alistair and Danny, with nine grandchildren.<ref name="mylife" /> Mitchell and his wife had adopted Boty Goodwin (1966-1995), daughter of the artist [[Pauline Boty]], following the death of her father, literary agent Clive Goodwin, in 1978. Following Boty Goodwin's death from a heroin overdose, Mitchell wrote the poem 'Especially when it snows' in her memory.<ref>Poem for the Day Two, Nicholas Albery, Chatto & Windus, 2005, p. 325</ref>
