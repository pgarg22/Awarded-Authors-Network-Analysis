'''Henry Savile Clarke''' (14 February 1841 &ndash; 5 October 1893) was an English dramatist, journalist and critic. He produced and wrote the lyrics and book for the first professional dramatisation of ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'' (1886) which remained a popular children's Christmas entertainment for half a century.<ref name=Resource>[https://lewiscarrollresources.net/savileclarke/ Savile Clarke ''Alice'' Productions], Lewis Carroll Resources website.</ref><ref name=Library>[https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/play-adaptation-of-alice-in-wonderland Play adaptation of ''Alice in Wonderland''], [[British Library]] website</ref><ref>[[Kurt Gänzl|Gänzl, Kurt]] ''The Encyclopedia of the Musical Theatre'', Blackwell/Schirmer (1994), Vol. 1, p. 301.</ref>

==Early life and family==
Clarke was the oldest of six children born to the Rev. Henry Clarke, Vicar of [[Guisborough]] (1814–1861), and his wife Catherine Frances ''née'' Dawson (1818–1852). Clarke went to Edinburgh to study medicine, but there became increasingly interested in journalism. He became one of the circle of enthusiastic young men around the writer [[James Hannay]] and consequently left medicine for literature. On 27 April 1865 Clarke married the artist Helen Weatherill (1840–1898) in Guisborough.<ref>[https://www.ancestry.co.uk/imageviewer/collections/1623/images/31280_199165-00585?pId=4408318 London, England, Church of England Marriages and Banns, 1754–1932 for Henry Clarke], St Mary, Islington, 1850–1870: Ancestry.com {{subscription}}</ref> In 1866 the couple moved to London, where they had three daughters: the writer Clara Savile Clarke (1869–1898), Margaret Helen "Maggie" Clarke (1870–1894) and Catherine Dawson "Kitty" Clarke (1872–1901).<ref name=History>[http://northyorkshirehistory.blogspot.com/2013/02/henry-savile-clarke-1841-93.html Henry Savile Clarke (1841-93)], North Yorkshire History website.</ref>

==Career==
Clarke took up writing in London and within a year or two was listed in advertising for ''[[Cassell's Magazine]]'', where he was described as one of its "well-known" contributors. He gradually became known as a journalist on various subjects, while writing light literature and the books and lyrics for musicals.<ref name=Library/> This career was to last for about 25 years.<ref name=History/> In 1878 he wrote the words for ''Songs of Israel'' to the music of Abraham Saqui (c. 1824–1893), the first choirmaster of the [[Princes Road Synagogue]] in [[Liverpool]]. Other works by Clarke include lyrics for the [[operetta]] ''An Adamless Eden!'' (1882) and for [[Lila Clay]] and her all-female troupe.<ref>[https://urresearch.rochester.edu/viewContributorPage.action;jsessionid=2AE165EA7900F5E219FB84B3960C60C3?personNameId=12528 An Adamless Eden: comic opera di camera / the words by H.

In August 1886 Clarke wrote to [[Lewis Carroll]] for permission to adapt ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' (1865) and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'' (1871) into a Christmas musical stage show. There had been some amateur productions of ''Alice'', and for the first and only time Carroll agreed to his work being performed on the professional stage. Carroll soon accepted Clarke's proposal, but with several stipulations:
"There are one or two ''wishes'' on the subject, which I will name for your consideration: but the only essential consideration is that I should have your written guarantee that, neither in the libretto nor in any of the stage business, should any coarseness, or anything suggestive of coarseness, be admitted.... This piece ought to be an Operetta (like ''[[The Mikado]]'') and not a [[Pantomime]]."<ref>[[Morton N. Cohen|Cohen, Morton N.]] (ed.)

Clarke wrote the book and lyrics for the successful musical ''[[Alice in Wonderland (musical)|Alice in Wonderland]]''<ref>"At the Play", ''[[The Observer]]'', 24 October 1886, p. 3.</ref> with music by [[Walter Slaughter]] and additional lyrics by [[Aubrey Hopwood]]. It opened as "A musical dream play in two acts" on 23 December 1886 at the [[Prince of Wales Theatre]], London, where it gained popularity, with [[Phoebe Carlo]] in the title role. Carroll was fully involved, offering advice on everything from adaptation to choosing the cast.{{cn|date=January 2021}} The musical had twelve [[West End theatre|West End]] revivals between 1888 and 1934.<ref>[[Kurt Gänzl]]: ''The Encyclopedia of the Musical Theatre'', Blackwell/Schirmer (1994), Vol. 1, p. 301.</ref> In 1890 Clarke was called on<!-- WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? --> to adapt [[William Makepeace Thackeray|Thackeray]]'s ''[[The Rose and the Ring]]'' which again was set to music by [[Walter Slaughter]].<ref name=History/>

An article in ''The Theatre'' in 1889 stated that Clarke wrote "many hundreds of leaders and other articles for London, country, and American papers". He was the London drama critic for ''[[The Scotsman]]'' and regularly contributed verse in various styles and stories and articles for magazines and periodicals as H. Savile Clarke, but occasionally signed with his initials "H.S.C.". In the 1891 Census, he listed himself as editor, author and newspaper proprietor,<ref>[https://www.ancestry.co.uk/imageviewer/collections/6598/images/LNDRG12_10_12-0455?pId=10552083 London, England, Church of England Marriages and Banns, 1754–1932 for Henry Clarke], Islington, St Mary, Islington, 1850–1870: Ancestry.com {{subscription}}</ref> but it is not known which newspaper he owned. Clarke wrote original plays and adapted stage works from German and French. He edited the ''[[Court Circular]]'' from 1872 until his death in 1893. He was a keen amateur photographer.<ref name=History/>

Clarke's journalism included writing for ''The Belgravia''; ''[[Fun (magazine)|Fun]]'',<ref> Laurel Brake and Marysa Demoor, ''The Dictionary of 19th Century Journalism in Great Britain and Ireland'', (2009), p. 237.</ref> ''The Latest News'' (becoming its editor in 1870), ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', ''[[Evening Standard|The London Evening Standard]]'', ''[[The Globe (London newspaper)|The Globe]]'', ''[[The Graphic]]'', ''The Theatre'', ''[[St James's Gazette]]'', ''[[The World (journal)|The World]]'', ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', and ''[[The Examiner (1808–1886)|The Examiner]]''.<ref name=History/>

While continuing with journalism, Clarke wrote nothing further for the theatre in 1891–1892 due to illness, although an early 1893 press statement stated that he was writing the libretto for a new opera for the [[Shaftesbury Theatre (1888)|Shaftesbury Theatre]].<ref name=History/>

==Death==
Clarke died of [[tuberculosis]], aged 52, in October 1893 at Cleveland Lodge, his long-time home in Alexander Street, Westbourne Gardens.<ref>[https://www.ancestry.co.uk/imageviewer/collections/8914/images/ONS_D18934AZ-0478?treeid=&personid=&hintid=&queryId=20f316cba411fbecd900730be6e3f651&usePUB=true&_phsrc=Hxx563&_phstart=successSource&usePUBJs=true&pId=6457469 England & Wales, Civil Registration Death Index, 1837–1915 for Henry Saville Clarke], 1893, Q4-Oct-Nov-Dec: Ancestry.com {{subscription}}.</ref><ref name=Probate/> He was buried in [[Kensal Green Cemetery]] on 9 October 1893.
