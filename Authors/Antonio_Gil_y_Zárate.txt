==Early life and education==
Antonio Gil y Zárate was born in [[El Escorial, Madrid|El Escorial]] in 1793 to Bernardo Gil, an actor well known in Madrid, and [[Ántonia Zárate]]. His mother died when the boy was quite young, and his father married a "celebrated actress", Antera Baus, so Antonio grew up in the world of theatre in Madrid.<ref name="primer"/>

As a youth, Gil y Zárate was sent to France for several years for his studies; he also studied in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]], in the subjects of physics and mathematics. He spent another two years in France in studies, where he also enjoyed the latest works in French literature. After returning to Spain, initially Gil y Zárate entered Spanish politics, like other young men of his class, but he soon started writing dramas.<ref name="primer"/>

==Literary career==
Gil y Zárate wrote his first play, the comedy ''La Cómico-Manía,'' in 1816, and was given encouragement. During the mid-1820s he had to deal with censorship, particularly that religious censorship by the Catholic Church, and ran into opposition for his work. For a few years he supported himself by teaching French at a commercial school in Madrid, until the climate lightened.<ref name="primer"/>

His next works to be produced were ''Blanca de Borbón'', produced in 1835, and ''Carlos II el Hechizado'' in 1837, which was highly popular. At the turn of the 20th century, the American scholar [[Sylvester Primer]] characterized this play as full of "irreligious and obscene sentimentalism," and Gil y Zárate tried to recall it.<ref name="primer"/>

The playwright's most productive period was in the 1830s and 1840s; while his plays during this period were extremely popular, these have not been considered of lasting value. His play, ''Guzmán el Bueno. Drama en Cuatro Actos,'' set in "medieval days of Spanish history," was considered to be his most substantial. It explored the life of a national hero of Spain, [[Alonso Pérez de Guzmán]], who had been treated as a figure in the nation's plays and literature for some time.<ref name="primer"/>

==Real Academia Española==

Associated with the [[Real Academia Española]] as an honorary academician since 1839, he was appointed full member in 1841. Together with fellow academicians [[Manuel Bretón de los Herreros]] and [[Ventura de la Vega]] Gil y Zárate drew up the new Statutes approved by the Academia in 1848.<ref name=dbe/>

==Pidal Plan==

The so-called [[Pidal Plan]] (1845) —the most important of a series of reforms in Spain's [[education system]] that would eventually lead to the so-called [[Ley Moyano]] (1857), which would remain in effect until 1970<ref>{{aut|Llorent Bedmar}}, Vincente.

Although named after his friend and mentor, [[Pedro José Pidal]], Spain's Minister of the Interior, who implemented the plan, it was actually drawn up by Gil y Zárate.<ref name=rah>{{aut|Ramos Corrada}}, Miguel (in Spanish).
