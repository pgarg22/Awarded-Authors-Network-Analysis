'''Felix Dahn''' (9 February 1834 – 3 January 1912) was a German law professor, [[German nationalism|German nationalist]] author, poet and historian.

==Biography==
Ludwig Julius Sophus Felix Dahn was born in [[Hamburg]] as the oldest son of Friedrich (1811–1889) and Constanze Dahn who were notable actors at the city's theatre. The family had both German and French roots. Dahn began his studies in law and philosophy in [[University of Munich|Munich]] (he had moved there with his parents in 1834), and graduated as [[Doctor of Laws]] in [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]]. After his [[habilitation treatise]], Dahn became a lecturer of German Law in Munich in 1857. In 1863 he became [[senior lecturer]]/[[associate professor]] in [[University of Würzburg|Würzburg]], received a professorship in [[University of Königsberg|Königsberg]] (in 1872).

Dahn was married to the artist Sophie Fries (1835–1898), with whom he had a son. He tutored baroness Therese von Droste-Hülshoff, a relative of the poet [[Annette von Droste-Hülshoff]], in poetry from 1867 and entered an illicit love affair with her, which he gave a literary treatment in his ''Sind Götter?'' (1874). He divorced his wife and married Therese, against opposition from both families, in 1873.

Dahn relocated to [[University of Breslau]] in 1888, again as a full professor, and was elected [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the university in 1895. As rector, he enforced a ban on Polish student associations.<ref>[[Norman Davies]], ''Microcosm'' (2003), p. 305</ref> 
He was an honorary member of [[German Student Corps]]{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} and an active member of the nationalist ''[[Alldeutscher Verband]]''.

Dahn received honorary doctorates in Medicine and in Philosophy. 

Dahn died in [[Breslau]], a month before his 78th birthday.

==Works==
Dahn's writings were influential in the conception of the European [[Migration Period]] (''Völkerwanderung'' ) in German historiography of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His multi-volume ''Prehistory of the Germanic and Roman Peoples'', a chronology of the Migration Period that first appeared in print in 1883, was so definitive that abbreviated versions were reprinted until the late 1970s.

From the 1860s, Dahn regularly wrote for ''[[Die Gartenlaube]]'', Germany's most popular family magazine. His nationalist historical novels were widely received, and according to Houdsen (1997) were influential in the formation of the ''[[völkisch]]'' ideology that formed the "Germany's pre-Hitlerian intellectual background for National Socialism".<ref>{{Cite book |quote=The philosophies of Fichte, Hegel, or Nietzsche did not contribute as much to Germany's pre-Hitlerian intellectual background for National Socialism as commemorations of the victory at Sedan (in the Franco-Prussian War), Bismarckian blood and iron quotations, the historical novels of Felix Dahn |title=Resistance and Conformity in the Third Reich |first=Martyn |last=Housden |year=1997 |publisher=Routledge |page=3 }}</ref> 
His 1876 ''[[A Struggle for Rome|Ein Kampf um Rom]]'' according to Kipper (2002) contributed to the [[ethnic essentialism]] and opposition to [[Miscegenation|ethnic miscegenation]] of the "völkisch avant-garde".<ref>[http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=266781088192848 Rainer Kipper.

Göttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 2002. 394 pp.] {{ISBN|978-3-525-35570-1}}., review at ''Humanities and Social sciences - Online - Net''</ref>

Dahn published numerous poems, many with a nationalist bent. His ''Mette von Marienburg'' portrays bands of "[[Masuria|Masures]] and Poles" hiding in the "[[Podolian Voivodeship|Podolian]] forest".<ref>''Gesammelte Werke. Band 5: Gedichte und Balladen'', Leipzig 1912. 
The comparison to packs of wolves is mentioned as stressing the "implacability of the Poles" alongside the writings of [[Arthur Jonetz]] and "many other German nationalists" by {{Cite book |title=German Nationalism and Religious Conflict: Culture, Ideology, Politics, 1870–1914 |first=Helmut Walser |last=Smith |year=2014 |page=173 }}</ref>

Besides his historical and literary production, Dahn also published a large amount of specialist legal literature, on topics such as [[trade law]] and [[international law]].
