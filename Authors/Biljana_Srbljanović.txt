'''Biljana Srbljanović''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Биљана Србљановић}}, {{IPA-sh|bǐʎana sr̩bʎǎːnoʋitɕ|pron}}; born 15 October 1970) is a Serbian [[playwright]].

She has written eleven plays for the [[theater]] and one TV screenplay for ''[[Otvorena vrata]]'' TV series that ran on [[Radio Television of Serbia]] during the mid-1990s. Her plays have been staged in some 50 countries. Srbljanović is also a part-time [[lecturer]] at the Faculty of the Dramatic Arts in [[Belgrade]]. On 1 December 1999 she became the first foreign writer to receive the ''[[Ernst Toller]]'' prize. She is the recipient of various theatre awards, including the ''Slobodan Selenić Award'', the ''Osvajanje Slobode Award'', the ''Belgrade City Award'', [[The Statuette of Joakim Vujić]] and the ''Sterija Award''.

== Early life ==
Srbljanović was born on 15 October 1970 in [[Stockholm]] as a daughter of a member of the Yugoslav embassy diplomatic staff.<ref>[http://www.yugopapir.com/2017/10/biljana-srbljanovic-dramaturskinja.html Interview] in Yugoslav teen magazine Super Tin (June 1997) on the website Yugopapir, retrieved on 2018-08-18.</ref><ref>[https://www.kurir.rs/vesti/drustvo/2381699/srbljanovic-ovo-je-istina-o-ustaskom-teroristi-baresic-je-sprao-krv-i-pucao-ambasadoru-sfrj-u-usta Article] commemorating the assassination of Yugoslav ambassador in Sweden in [[Kurir]], retrieved on 2018-08-18.</ref><ref>[https://issuu.com/collettiva/docs/biljana-srbljanovic-rs Text of the speech] (emigrant; p. 14) on the website [[issuu]], retrieved on 2018-08-18.</ref>

==Writing career==
Srbljanović obtained her [[dramaturgy]] degree in 1995 at the Faculty of Dramatic Arts in Belgrade. The first play she wrote, ''Beogradska trilogija'' (''The Belgrade Trilogy''), was premiered in 1997 in Belgrade, [[Serbia]] at the [[Yugoslav Drama Theater]]. After its huge success, the play was staged in many other countries, including [[Italy]], [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], [[Belgium]], [[England]], and the [[Scandinavia]]n countries.

In April 1998 her second play, ''Porodične priče'' (''Family Stories''), was written in Belgrade and staged at [[Atelje 212]]. It won the Best New Play Award at the theatre festival in [[Novi Sad]], Serbia and was later staged in Germany, [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Slovenia]], [[United States]], Switzerland, the [[Netherlands]], [[France]] and elsewhere.

In December 1999, Srbljanović completed ''The Fall'', which premiered in July 2000 at the City Theater Festival in [[Budva]], [[Montenegro]]. Due to lack of public interest, the play was quickly erased from the program of [[Belgrade]]'s theaters.

The young artist can also be seen in the Serbian movie ''Land of Truth, Love and Freedom'' (Zemlja istine ljubavi i slobode) as an actress in a leading role.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUmUdrpptNE Full movie] (with English subtitles) on [[YouTube]], retrieved on 2018-08-22.</ref>

The premiere of ''Supermarket'', her fourth play, took place in May 2001 at the Festival of [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. It is still staged in many European countries.

In late 2003, Srbljanović completed her fifth play, ''America, Part Two''. This became Serbia's most popular play in 2003 and 2004.

Srbljanović's next play, ''Skakavci'' (Locusts), won the New Theatrical Realities Award, one of Europe's most prominent theatre awards. In the 2005-06 season, German theater magazine [[Theater Heute]] proclaimed Srbljanović the best foreign playwright of the season.<ref>[http://www.b92.net/eng/news/society-article.php?yyyy=2007&mm=04&dd=24&nav_category=126 B92 - News - Society - Serbian playwright wins prestigious award<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929120509/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/society-article.php?yyyy=2007&mm=04&dd=24&nav_category=126 |date=2007-09-29 }}</ref>

Her latest play ''[[This Grave Is Too Small For Me]]'' has attracted international press attention as well as acclaim from various audiences in Europe.<ref name=wsj>{{cite news|title=Biljana Srbljanovic on Her New Play|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303627504579559673459534630|access-date=September 7, 2015|date=May 22, 2014|first=Ginanne|last=Brownell}}</ref>

==Political career==
In 2007 Srbljanović joined the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Serbia 2005)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP), with an additional role as a member of the party's political council.<ref>[http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2007&mm=04&dd=23&nav_id=243233&nav_category=418 B92 - Vesti - Lečić napustio predsedništvo LDP-a - Internet, Radio i TV stanica; najnovije vesti iz Srbije<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Srbljanović was LDP's candidate for mayor of [[Belgrade]] in the [[2008 Serbian local elections]]. She has distanced herself from the party afterwards.

==Views and opinions==
Srbljanović has for decades been an outspoken figure in the Serbian public sphere.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, during her university days, Srbljanović was a close friend of [[Isidora Bjelica]] and wrote for the [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] ''[[Pogledi]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite news|last=Stojićević|first=Slobodan|url=http://www.politika.rs/pogledi/Slobodan-Stojicevic/STARA-LJUBAV-ZABORAVA-NEMA.sr.html|title=СТАРА ЉУБАВ ЗАБОРАВА НЕМА|agency=[[Politika]]|date=26 March 2008|access-date=20 December 2014}}</ref>

By mid-1990s, Srbljanović's political views swung to the [[left-wing politics|left]] as she began fiercely opposing the policies of [[Slobodan Milošević]] as well as views held by individuals and parties in the Serbian political opposition on the right side of the political spectrum. In 1997, as one of the guests on [[Olja Bećković]]'s ''[[Utisak nedelje]]'' talk programme on [[RTV Studio B|Studio B]], Srbljanović squared off against her former ''Pogledi'' editor-in-chief [[Miloslav Samardžić]] over the issue of American magnate [[George Soros]] injecting funds into the pro-[[Western world|Western]] Serbian media outlets, primarily [[B92]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Samardžić|first=Miloslav|url=http://www.svedok.rs/index.asp?show=73318|title=Nikola je bio najbolji!|agency=[[Svedok]]|date=2008|access-date=20 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221061709/http://www.svedok.rs/index.asp?show=73318|archive-date=21 December 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Even after the 5 October 2000 Overthrow in Serbia, she continued railing against what she viewed to be "the irresponsibility of the political elite in Serbia", "Serbian violent nationalism" and "the culture of violence and exclusion in Serbian daily life".{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} From May 2006 until February 2009, she maintained her own blog on the B92.net site<ref>http://blog.b92.net/blog/105/Biljana%20Srbljanovi%C4%87/ Biljana's blog.b92.net</ref> where among other things she frequently criticized various individuals, mostly Serbian politicians and other public figures who displayed political opinions she opposes such as [[Nebojša Krstić]], adviser to the Serbian president [[Boris Tadić]].

In 2010 Srbljanović opened a [[Twitter]] account where she continued commenting on Serbian politics. During late summer 2011, she got into several heated exchanges with the Democratic Party (DS) spokeswoman Jelena Trivan.<ref>[http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Politika/272814/Okrsaj-SrbljanovicTrivan-na-Tviteru Okršaj Srbljanović-Trivan na Tviteru] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225071251/http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Politika/272814/Okrsaj-SrbljanovicTrivan-na-Tviteru |date=2012-02-25 }};''Blic'', 23 August 2011</ref><ref>[http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Politika/277989/Svadja-Biljane-Srbljanovic-i-Jelene-Trivan-na-Tviteru Svađa Biljane Srbljanović i Jelene Trivan na Tviteru];''Blic'', 20 September 2011</ref>

== Controversy ==
===Libel suit===
In March 2001, Srbljanović was sued for [[libel]] by film director [[Emir Kusturica]] as a result of her ''[[Vreme]]'' magazine op-ed in which she passingly refers to the director as "[[Slobodan Milošević|Milošević]]'s immoral profiteer", accusing him of "direct collaboration with the [Milošević] regime through [[Milorad Vučelić]] [Kusturica's friend and [[Radio Television of Serbia|Serbian state-owned TV]] (RTS) general-director]" based on her claim that Kusturica's 1995 film ''[[Underground (1995 film)|Underground]]'' was "mostly financed by the Milošević-controlled RTS".<ref>[http://www.allocine.fr/article/fichearticle_gen_carticle=701639.html Kusturica encore montré du doigt];allocine.fr, 27 September 2001</ref><ref>[http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2001/09/15/srpski/H01091407.shtml Umesto pomirenja - tužba];''Glas javnosti'', 14 September 2001</ref> Six months later, in September 2001 right before the first [[discovery (law)|court date]], ''Vreme'' magazine organized a mediation attempt between the two parties, with Kusturica and Srbljanović meeting face to face in the magazine's offices.<ref name="blic-sept-2001">{{cite web|url=http://www.blic.rs/stara_arhiva/kultura/8815/Ko-je-nemoralan|title=Ko je (ne)moralan?|website=blic.rs|date= 14 September 2001}}</ref> At the meeting Kusturica reportedly expressed willingness to drop the lawsuit if Srbljanović issues a public apology, which Srbljanović refused.<ref name="blic-sept-2001"/> The next day at the first court date Srbljanović once again rejected the offer of a public apology.<ref name="blic-sept-2001"/>

In December 2003, two and a half years after the initial filing, a municipal court (''opštinski sud'') in Belgrade ruled in Kusturica's favour as Srbljanović's claims couldn't stand up to closer scrutiny after Kusturica's attorney Branislav Tapušković provided a complete documentation of ''Underground'' producers and financiers, proving that funding mostly came from several France-based production companies while parts of the movie were only shot on RTS [[sound stage]]s in Belgrade.<ref>[http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/aktuelno.69.html:153603-Srbljanovi263---kriva-za-klevetu Srbljanović kriva za klevetu];''Večernje novosti'', 28 December 2003</ref>

===Other===
In July 2007 Srbljanović criticized basketball player [[Milan Gurović]] on her blog, referring to him as "that tattooed idiot", for having a tattoo of [[World War II]] [[Chetniks|Chetnik]] leader [[Draža Mihailović]] on his arm.<ref>[http://blog.b92.net/text/504/blogovstina/ Biljana Srbljanovic blog, 21 July 2007]</ref>

Additionally, Srbljanović aroused controversy with her 18 February 2012 tweet referring to the news item about former Serbian interior minister [[Dragan Jočić]] getting extra police security following the arrest of the organized crime figure {{ill|Luka Bojović|sr}}. Srbljanović's tweet — "'Jočić getting extra security detail' why? he ain't gonna run" — mocked the fact Jočić is [[physical disability|physically disabled]] ever since his 2008 car accident.<ref>[http://www.kurir-info.rs/vesti/drustvo/skandal-biljana-srbljanovic-se-sprda-s-invalidima-185784.php Biljana Srbljanović se sprda s invalidima!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229210201/http://www.kurir-info.rs/vesti/drustvo/skandal-biljana-srbljanovic-se-sprda-s-invalidima-185784.php |date=29 February 2012 }};''Kurir'', 25 February 2012</ref>

Srbljanović set off a torrent of negative sentiment from the general public in Serbia after making an awkward joke on Twitter during the catastrophic [[2014 Southeast Europe floods|May 2014 floods]]. The tweet in Serbian read "Excuse me for not being compassionate, but you have 10 more minutes to swim to the gallery for the promotion of the book ''Tomato''". A flurry of tweets, Facebook posts and news updates were quick to condemn the post, and her Twitter account @leyakeller became unavailable not long after <ref>[http://www.kurir-info.rs/dijagnoza-biljana-srbljanovic-je-izgubila-razum-clanak-1375597/ ''Kurir Daily'', 19 May 2014] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140828222952/http://www.kurir-info.rs/dijagnoza-biljana-srbljanovic-je-izgubila-razum-clanak-1375597 |date=28 August 2014 }}</ref>

In January 2019, Srbljanović got into a vicious online exchange with the actor and newly-appointed [[Movement of Free Citizens (Serbia)|Movement of Free Citizens]] (PSG) leader [[Sergej Trifunović]] whom she had previously collaborated with professionally in addition to an overlap in their respective studies at the [[University of Arts in Belgrade|University of Arts]]' Faculty of Dramatic Arts (FDU). Prompted by Trifunović's tweet about her early 1990s right-wing views and political activism,<ref>https://twitter.com/WhistlerDick/status/1086751247636594690 tweet by Sergej Trifunović on 19 Jan 2019, 2:24pm</ref> Srbljanović launched into an obscenity-laced, insult-laden tirade on her Facebook account, denouncing Trifunović's [[morality]], [[professionalism]], [[personal hygiene]], and accusing him of responsibility in the murder of [[Zoran Đinđić]].<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/leya.keller/posts/2351346614889923 Facebook post by Biljana Srbljanović on 19 Jan 2019, 3:59pm]</ref><ref name="blic-january-2019">{{cite news|last=M.|first=M.|url=https://www.blic.rs/vesti/politika/lepse-je-s-kulturom-pljuste-psovke-i-uvrede-izmedu-sergeja-trifunovica-i-biljane/xmp6jpm|title=Pljušte psovke i uvrede između Sergeja Trifunovića i Biljane Srbljanović|agency=[[Blic]]|date=20 January 2019|access-date=12 February 2019}}</ref><ref name="danas-january-2019">{{cite news|last=Živanović|first=K.|url=https://www.danas.rs/drustvo/trifunovic-pucaju-na-mene-iz-svih-raspolozivih-oruzja/|title=Trifunović: "Pucaju" na mene iz svih raspoloživih oružja|agency=[[Danas (newspaper)|Danas]]|date=22 January 2019|access-date=12 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegram.hr/kultura/biljana-srbljanovic-jedna-od-uglednijih-dramaticarki-u-regiji-po-mrezama-se-tabloidno-mlati-sa-sergejom-trifunovicem/#|title=Biljana Srbljanović, jedna od najuglednijih dramatičarki u regiji, po mrežama se tabloidno mlati sa Sergejom Trifunovićem|agency=Telegram.hr|date=20 January 2019|access-date=12 February 2019}}</ref> Serbian actress and film producer {{ill|Bojana Maljević|sr}}, who has also had a prior professional history with Srbljanović, supported the veracity of the event Trifunović mentioned in his original tweet.<ref>https://twitter.com/BojanaMaljevic/status/1086759243242459137 tweet by Bojana Maljević on 19 Jan 2019, 2:56pm</ref><ref name="blic1-january-2019">{{cite news|last=M.|first=M.|url=https://www.blic.rs/vesti/politika/za-razliku-od-nje-koja-je-pljuvala-po-svima-u-raspravu-sergeja-trifunovica-i-biljane/jhcd372|title=U raspravu Sergeja Trifunovića i Biljane Srbljanović se uključila i Bojana Maljević.
