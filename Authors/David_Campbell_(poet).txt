'''David Watt Ian Campbell''' (16 July 1915{{spaced ndash}}29 July 1979) was an [[Australian poetry#Poetry|Australian poet]] who wrote over 15 volumes of prose and poetry. He was also a talented [[rugby union]] player who represented [[England national rugby union team|England]] in two tests.

==Life==
Campbell was born on 16 July 1915 at Ellerslie Station, near [[Adelong, New South Wales]]. He was the third child of Australian-born parents Alfred Campbell, a grazier and medical practitioner, and his wife Edith Madge, née Watt.<ref name = "Kramer">Kramer (2006)</ref>

In 1930, Campbell went to [[The King's School, Parramatta]], and in 1935, with the support of the headmaster, he enrolled at [[Jesus College, Cambridge]], graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1937. His studies in English literature developed his interest in poetry.<ref name = "Kramer" /> At Cambridge, he excelled at [[rugby union]] and as well as earning a [[Cambridge Blue|Blue]] after playing in [[The Varsity Match]], he was chosen for [[England national rugby union team|England]]. Playing at [[flanker (rugby union)|flanker]] he made his debut in the [[test match (rugby union)|test match]] against [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] at [[Twickenham Stadium|Twickenham]] in 1937. He played a second test that year against [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]].<ref>{{cite web|title=ESPN Scrum|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/england/rugby/player/4462.html|work=David Campbell Statistics}}</ref>

Campbell returned to Australia from Cambridge in 1938 and on 6 November 1939 joined the [[Royal Australian Air Force]]. He had learned to fly while at Cambridge and went to train as a pilot at [[Point Cook]]. He served in [[New Guinea]], where he was injured and awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]], and flew bombing missions from [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] in the Northern Territory.<ref name = "Kramer" />

Campbell married Bonnie Edith Lawrence on 20 January 1940 at St John's Anglican Church, Toorak, Melbourne. They had two sons (including John) and a daughter, but were divorced in 1973.<ref name = "Kramer" /> In 1946, he settled on a family property, ''Wells Station'', near [[Canberra]], and in 1961 he moved to Palerang, near [[Bungendore, New South Wales]]. In 1968, he moved again to ''The Run'', [[Queanbeyan, New South Wales]].

On 18 February 1974 Campbell married Judith Anne Jones in Sydney. From May to September 1975 they travelled in England and Europe, his first trip abroad since his Cambridge days.<ref name = "Kramer" />

He had many literary friends. These included, in addition to poet and editor, [[Douglas Stewart (poet)|Douglas Stewart]], historian [[Manning Clark]], poet [[Rosemary Dobson]], writer [[Patrick White]], and poet and academic [[A. D. Hope]].<ref name = "Kramer" /> He was interested in painting, golf and polo, and was a keen fisherman, an activity he often shared with Douglas Stewart. Manning Clark has written about aspects of his friendship with David Campbell. Campbell, wrote Clark "was an enlarger of life, not a straitener or measurer, or a life-denier" the key to him being found in "the two books he re-read each year: ''The Idiot'' by Dostoevsky, and ''The Aunt's Story'' by Patrick White.<ref name="CMH Clark 1990, p 216">CMH Clark. The Quest For Grace. Penguin Books Ringwood 1990, p 216.</ref> "He was the war hero, the victor in the boxing ring, the strong man in the rugby scrum, the fisherman, the horseman, the polo player who knew all about Myshkin [character from The Idiot] and Theodora Goodman [character from The Aunt's Story]. I saw him knock out a man in the bar at [[Delegate, New South Wales|Delegate]] for casting doubts on his manhood. The next morning I saw him cast a fly with such delicacy that it landed on the waters of the [[Snowy River]] with the grace of a butterfly."<ref name="CMH Clark 1990, p 216" />

David Campbell died of cancer on 29 July 1979, at the Royal Canberra Hospital.

==Literary career==
While Campbell had a few poems published in Cambridge journals between 1935 and 1937, his poetry didn't start appearing regularly in print until 1942 when he started sending poems to [[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin]].<ref name = "Kramer" /> Six were published by 1944. It was in these years that he first became known to [[Douglas Stewart (poet)|Douglas Stewart]], with whom he formed a long-standing friendship. These early poems dealt primarily with war, but from 1946, after his move to Wells Station, "his poetry became more closely attuned to the realities of the countryside".<ref name = "Kramer" /> Kramer writes that "his daily life as a grazier, his acute observations of the natural world and his deep understanding of European poetry gave him a distinctive poetic voice, learned but not didactic, harmonious but not bland, vigorous but finely tuned".<ref name = "Kramer" />

The following are representative examples of his use of European and Asian ([[haiku]]) poetic forms to capture the [[contemplative]] experience of the [[Monaro (New South Wales)|Monaro]] plains.

"For now the sharp leaves<br />
On the tree are still<br />
And the great blond paddocks<br />
Come down from the hill."<ref>David Campbell. 'In Summer's Tree' in David Campbell. Collected Poems. Leonie Kramer (ed) Angus and Robertson. Sydney 1989 p 33</ref>

"See how these autumn days begin<br />
With spider-webs against the sun,<br />
And frozen shadows, fiery cocks,<br />
And starlings riding sheep-backs."<ref>David Campbell. 'Against the Sun' in David Campbell Poems. Edwatrds and Shaw. Sydney. 1962 p 10.</ref>

"The powdered bloom along the bough<br />
Wavers like a candle's breath;<br />
Where snow falls softly into snow<br />
Iris and rivers have their birth."<ref>David Campbell. 'Snow Gums' in David Campbell. Collected Poems. Leonie Kramer (ed) Angus and Robertson. Sydney 1989 p 35.</ref>

"White snow daisies spring,<br />
Snowgums glint from granite rock,<br />
Whitebacked magpies sing."<ref>David Campbell. 'Bikinis' in David Campbell. Collected Poems. Leonie Kramer (ed) Angus and Robertson. Sydney 1989 p 122.</ref>

As well as writing poetry, Campbell also edited several anthologies, including the 1966 edition of ''Australian Poetry'' and, in 1970, ''Modern Australian Poetry''. He also wrote short stories, and became known for the support he gave to young poets.

==Mullion Park==
In November 2007, Mullion Park was officially opened in [[Gungahlin]] in the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. The park is located in an area which incorporates what was once Campbell's property at Wells Station. The original paddock boundary is marked by a line of remnant [[eucalypt|eucalypt trees]] and the original fence by ceramic tiles inlaid with barbed wire.<ref name = "Jon Stanhope">Jon Stanhope (November 2007)</ref> The name of the park comes from the book of poems, ''The Miracle of Mullion Hill'', which Campbell wrote when he lived at Wells Station with his family. It was published in 1956.<ref name = "Florez" />
 
The park honours Campbell, "not for his work as a grazier, nor for his dedication to the Royal Australian Air Force, in which he served and was wounded as a pilot in World War II, but for his lyrical poetry about love, war and the Australian rural life".<ref name = "Florez">Florez (2007)</ref> At the opening of the park, Chief Minister of the ACT, [[Jon Stanhope]], said that Campbell is "often called the poet of the Monaro" and that his poetry "reflects the local landscape and was greatly influenced by his life as a farmer of the surrounding countryside".<ref name = "Jon Stanhope" /> The park incorporates excerpts from his poems, embedded in wooden pedestals and on pathways. It is intended to connect residents of Wells Station to the heritage of the region and provide a cultural as well as a recreational retreat.<ref name = "Jon Stanhope" />
