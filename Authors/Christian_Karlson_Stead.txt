==Early life and education==
Stead was born in [[Auckland]] in 1932. He attended [[Mount Albert Grammar School]].<ref name="Read NZ">{{cite web |title=Stead, C.K. |url=https://www.read-nz.org/writer/stead-ck/ |website=Read NZ Te Pou Muramura |access-date=24 October 2020}}</ref> He has said that growing up he rarely read New Zealand writers: "I read a few New Zealand writers at school but mainly it was a British education so one read British writers really".<ref name="ABC interview" /> Stead began writing poetry at about age 14 when he read a copy of the collected works of [[Rupert Brooke]], sent by his sister's penpal in England.<ref name="ABC interview" />

Stead graduated from the [[University of Auckland]] with a Bachelor of Arts in 1959, and earned his Masters of Arts the following year.<ref name="Britannica">{{Britannica|564405|C.K. Stead}}</ref> At this time he and his wife were neighbours with short-story writer [[Frank Sargeson]]. Writer [[Janet Frame]] was living in a hut in Sargeson's garden, having recently been discharged after nine years in a mental hospital. Frame later wrote about this time in her memoir ''An Angel at My Table'', and Stead covered the same period in his autobiographical novel ''All Visitors Ashore'' (1984).<ref name="Wroe">{{cite news |last1=Wroe |first1=Nicholas |title=Writing in the dark |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/mar/10/featuresreviews.guardianreview35 |access-date=25 October 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=10 March 2007}}</ref>

==Academic and literary career==
[[File:Hamilton2.jpg|thumb|Stead (left) at the [[1981 South Africa rugby union tour of New Zealand and the United States|1981 protest against Springboks]] in Hamilton]]
Stead completed his [[PhD]] at the [[University of Bristol]] in 1961.<ref name="Britannica"/> From 1959 to 1986, Stead taught at the University of Auckland, becoming the Professor of English in 1968.<ref name="Britannica" /> In 1964, Stead published his first book, ''The New Poetic'' (1964), based on his PhD study of [[W. B. Yeats]], [[Ezra Pound]], [[T.S. Eliot]] and the Georgian poets. It went on to sell over 100,000 copies.<ref name="Wroe" /> His first book of poems, ''Whether the Will Is Free: Poems 1954–62'', was published in the same year.<ref name="Britannica" />

Stead's first novel, ''Smith's Dream'', about a war similar to the [[Vietnam War]] in New Zealand, was published in 1971.<ref name="Wroe" /> Stead was an opponent of the Vietnam War.<ref name="Wroe" /> ''Smith's Dream'' provided the basis for the film ''[[Sleeping Dogs (1977 film)|Sleeping Dogs]]'', starring [[Sam Neill]], which became the first New Zealand film released in the United States.

In the 1980s, Stead's writings about [[Māori rights]] and [[feminism]] became the subject of some criticism.<ref name="Wroe" /> For example, in an article published in the ''[[London Review of Books]]'' in December 1986, he wrote that the representation of New Zealand history by [[Witi Ihimaera]] in his novel ''The Matriarch'' (1986) was inaccurate "insofar as it ascribes conscious and malicious intent to the Pakeha and unwillingness to the Maori", and was highly critical of the novel.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stead |first1=C.K. |title=War Book |journal=London Review of Books |date=18 December 1986 |volume=8 |issue=22 |url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v08/n22/c.k.-stead/war-book |access-date=25 October 2020}}</ref> In consequence his editorship of the ''Faber Book of Contemporary South Pacific Stories'' was boycotted by some writers, including [[Keri Hulme]], although Stead denied accusations of racism or being anti-Māori.<ref name="Mitenkova">{{cite journal |last1=Mitenkova |first1=Maria |title=Challenging Biculturalism: the Case of C.K.
