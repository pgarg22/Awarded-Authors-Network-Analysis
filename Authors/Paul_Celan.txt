'''Paul Celan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɛ|l|æ|n}};<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/celan "Celan"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.</ref> {{IPA-de|ˈtseːlaːn|lang}}; 23 November 1920 – c. 20 April 1970) was a Romanian-born German-language poet and translator. He was born as '''Paul Antschel''' to a [[Jew]]ish family in Cernăuți (German: Czernowitz), in the then [[Kingdom of Romania]] (now [[Chernivtsi]], Ukraine), and adopted the pseudonym "Paul Celan". He became one of the major German-language poets of the post-[[World War II]] era.

==Life==

===Early life===
Celan was born into a German-speaking [[Jew]]ish family in [[Cernăuți]], [[Bukovina]], a region then part of Romania and earlier part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] (when his birthplace was known as Czernowitz). His first home was in the Wassilkogasse in Cernăuți. His father, Leo Antschel, was a [[Zionism|Zionist]] who advocated his son's education in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] at the Jewish school ''Safah Ivriah'' (meaning ''the Hebrew language'').

Celan's mother, Fritzi, was an avid reader of [[German literature]] who insisted German be the language of the house. In his teens Celan became active in Jewish [[Socialism|Socialist]] organizations and fostered support for the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] cause in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. His earliest known poem is titled ''Mother's Day 1938''.

Paul attended the Liceul Ortodox de Băieți No. 1 (Boys' Orthodox Secondary School No. 1) from 1930 until 1935, Liceul de Băieți No. 2 în Cernăuți (Boys' Secondary School No. 2 in Cernăuți) from 1935 to 1936,<ref>Celan, Paul, and Axel Gellhaus. ''Paul Antschel/Paul Celan in Czernowitz'', Deutsche Schillergesellschafy 2001 {{ISBN|978-3-933679-40-6}}</ref> followed by the Liceul Marele Voievod Mihai (Great Prince Mihai Preparatory School, now Chernivtsi School No. 5), where he studied from 1936 until graduating in 1938. At this time Celan secretly began to write poetry.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/czernowitz-school-lmvm.htm |title=The Schools of Czernowitz Graduating Class of 1938 |work=Antschel, P., 2nd row from top |publisher=MuseumOfFamilyHistory.com |access-date=19 November 2009}}</ref>

In 1938 Celan traveled to [[Tours]], France, to study [[medicine]]. The [[Anschluss]] precluded his study in Vienna, and Romanian schools were harder to get into due to the newly imposed [[Jewish quota]]. His journey to France took him through Berlin as the events of [[Kristallnacht]] unfolded, and also introduced him to his uncle, Bruno Schrager, who was later among the French detainees who died at [[Auschwitz concentration camp#Auschwitz II .28Birkenau.29|Birkenau]]. Celan returned to Cernăuţi in 1939 to study [[literature]] and [[Romance languages]].

===Life during World War II===
Following the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] occupation of Bukovina in June 1940, deportations to [[Siberia]] started. A year later, following the reconquest by Romania, [[Nazi Germany]] and the then-fascist Romanian regime brought [[ghetto]]s, internment, and forced labour (see [[Romania in World War II]]).

On arrival in Cernăuți in July 1941, the German [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] [[Einsatzkommando]] and their Romanian allies set the city's [[Czernowitz Synagogue|Great Synagogue]] on fire. In October, the Romanians deported a large number of Jews after forcing them into a ghetto, where Celan translated [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s [[Shakespeare's sonnets|sonnets]] and continued to write his own poetry. Before the ghetto was dissolved in the fall of that year, Celan was pressed into labor, first clearing the debris of a demolished post office, and then gathering and destroying [[Russian language|Russian]] books.

The local mayor, [[Traian Popovici]], strove to mitigate the harsh circumstances, until the governor of Bukovina had the Jews rounded up and deported, starting on a Saturday night in June 1942. Celan hoped to convince his parents to leave the country so as to escape certain persecution. While Celan was away from home, on 21 June 1942, his parents were taken from their home and sent by train to an [[internment camp]] in [[Transnistria Governorate]], where two-thirds of the deportees eventually perished. Celan's father likely perished of [[typhus]] and his mother was shot after being exhausted by forced labour. Later that year, after having himself been taken to a labour camp in [[Romanian Old Kingdom|Romania]], Celan would receive reports of his parents' deaths.

Celan remained imprisoned in a work-camp until February 1944, when the Red Army's advance forced the Romanians to abandon the camps, whereupon he returned to Cernăuţi shortly before the Soviets returned. There, he worked briefly as a nurse in the mental hospital. Friends from this period recall Celan expressing immense guilt over his separation from his parents, whom he had tried to convince to go into hiding prior to the deportations, shortly before their deaths.

===Life after the war===
Considering emigration to Palestine, Celan left Cernăuţi in 1945 for Bucharest, where he remained until 1947. He was active in the Jewish literary community as both a translator of [[Russian literature]] into Romanian, and as a poet, publishing his work under a variety of pseudonyms. The literary scene of the time was richly populated with [[Surrealism|surrealists]] – [[Gellu Naum]], [[Ilarie Voronca]], [[Gherasim Luca]], [[Paul Păun]], and [[Dolfi Trost]] – and it was in this period that Celan developed pseudonyms both for himself and his friends, including the one he took as his pen name. Here he also met with the poets [[Rose Ausländer]] and {{ill|Immanuel Weissglas|de}}, elements of whose works he would reuse in his poem "[[Todesfuge]]" (1944–45).

A version of Celan's poem "Todesfuge" appeared as "{{Lang|ro|Tangoul Morţii}}" ("Death [[tango music|Tango]]") in a Romanian translation of May 1947. Additional remarks were published explaining that the dancing and musical performances evoked in the poem were images of realities of the [[Nazi concentration camps|extermination camp]] life.{{citation needed-span|date=December 2019|text=}}

===Emigration and Paris years===
On the emergence of the communist regime in Romania, Celan fled Romania for Vienna, Austria. It was there that he befriended [[Ingeborg Bachmann]], who had just completed a dissertation on [[Martin Heidegger]]. Facing a city divided between occupying powers and with little resemblance to the mythic capital it once was, which had harboured the (now) shattered [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] Jewish community, he moved to Paris in 1948. In that year his first poetry collection, ''[[Der Sand aus den Urnen]]'' ("Sand from the Urns"), was published in Vienna by A. Sexl. His first few years in Paris were marked by intense feelings of loneliness and isolation, as expressed in letters to his colleagues, including his longtime friend from Cernăuţi, Petre Solomon. It was also during this time that he exchanged many letters with Diet Kloos, a young Dutch singer and anti-Nazi resister who saw her husband of a few months tortured to death. She visited Celan twice in Paris between 1949 and 1951.

In 1952, Celan's writing began to gain recognition when he read his poetry on his first reading trip to Germany<ref>''Paul Celan By Paul Celan'', [[Pierre Joris]]{{full citation needed|date=June 2020}}</ref> where he was invited to read at the semiannual meetings of [[Group 47]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Lyon|first=James K.|year=2006|title=Paul Celan and Martin Heidegger: An Unresolved Conversation, 1951–1970|page=22|location=Baltimore, Maryland|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=9780801883026}}</ref> At their May meeting he read his poem ''[[Todesfuge]]'' ("Death Fugue"), a depiction of concentration camp life. When [[Ingeborg Bachmann]], with whom Celan had an affair, won the group's prize for her collection ''{{Lang|de|Die gestundete Zeit}}'' (''The Extended Hours''), Celan (whose work had received only six votes) said "After the meeting, only six people remembered my name".{{cite quote|date=June 2020}} He did not attend any other meeting of the group.

[[File:Grave-Paul-Celan.jpg|thumb|The grave of Paul Celan at the [[Cimetière de Thiais]] near Paris]]

In November 1951, he met the [[graphic artist]] [[Gisèle Lestrange]], in Paris. He sent her many love letters, influenced by [[Franz Kafka]]'s correspondence with [[Milena Jesenská]] and [[Felice Bauer]]. They married on 21 December 1952, despite the opposition of her aristocratic family. During the following 18 years they wrote over 700 letters; amongst the active correspondents of Celan were [[Hermann Lenz]] and his wife, Hanne.<ref>See: ''Paul Celan, Hanne und Hermann Lenz: Briefwechsel'', ed. von Barbara Wiedemann (and others). Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp 2001.</ref> He made his living as a translator and lecturer in German at the [[École normale supérieure (Paris)|École normale supérieure]]. He was a close friend of [[Nelly Sachs]], who later won the Nobel Prize for literature.

Celan became a French citizen in 1955 and lived in Paris. Celan's sense of persecution increased after the widow of a friend, the French-German poet [[Yvan Goll]], unjustly accused him of having plagiarised her husband's work.<ref>Hamburger p. xxiii.{{incomplete short citation|date=January 2020}} For detail on this traumatic event, see Felstiner, ''Paul Celan'',{{incomplete short citation|date=January 2020}} ''[[op. cit.]]'' pp. 72, 154–155, a literary biography from which much in this entry's pages is derived.</ref> Celan was awarded the [[Literaturpreis der Stadt Bremen|Bremen Literature Prize]] in 1958 and the [[Georg Büchner Prize]] in 1960.<ref>Collected prose / By Paul Celan, Rosemarie Waldrop</ref>

Celan drowned himself in the river [[Seine]] in Paris around 20 April 1970.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/12/31/reviews/001231.31anderst.html |title=A Poet at War With His Language |last=Anderson |first=Mark A. |work=The New York Times |date=31 December 2000|access-date=7 August 2009}}</ref>

==Poetry and poetics==
The death of his parents and the experience of the Shoah ([[The Holocaust]]) are defining forces in Celan's poetry and his use of language. In his Bremen Prize speech, Celan said of language after [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] that:

{{quote|Only one thing remained reachable, close and secure amid all losses: language. Yes, language. In spite of everything, it remained secure against loss. But it had to go through its own lack of answers, through terrifying silence, through the thousand darknesses of murderous speech. It went through. It gave me no words for what was happening, but went through it. Went through and could resurface, 'enriched' by it all.<ref>from "Speech on the Occasion of Receiving the Literature Prize of the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen", p. 34, in Celan's ''Collected Prose'', translated by [[Rosmarie Waldrop]], Riverdale-on-Hudson, New York, The Sheep Meadow Press, 1986. Cf.: "Reachable, near and not lost, there remained in the midst of the losses this one thing: language. It, the language, remained, not lost, yes in spite of everything. But it had to pass through its own answerlessness, pass through frightful muting, pass through the thousand darknesses of deathbringing speech. It passed through and gave back no words for that which happened; yet it passed through this happening. Passed through and could come to light again, 'enriched' by all this." from {{harvnb|Felstiner|2000|p=395}}</ref>}}

Celan also said: "There is nothing in the world for which a poet will give up writing, not even when he is a Jew and the language of his poems is German."<ref>Felstiner, ''op. cit.'', p. 56.{{incomplete short citation|date=January 2020}}</ref>

His most famous poem, the early "[[Todesfuge]]", is a work of great complexity and power, which may have drawn some key motifs from the poem "ER" by {{ill|Immanuel Weissglas|de}}, another [[Cernăuţi|Czernovitz]] poet.<ref name=Rostagno>Enzo Rostagno [http://www.anti-rev.org/textes/Traverso97a6/ "Paul Celan et la poésie de la destruction" ] in "L'Histoire déchirée. Essai sur Auschwitz et les intellectuels", Les [[Éditions du Cerf]] 1997 ({{ISBN|978-2-204-05562-8}}), in French.</ref> The characters of Margarete and Sulamith, with their respectively golden and ashen hair, can be interpreted as a reflection of Celan's Jewish-German culture,<ref name=Rostagno /> while the blue-eyed "Master from Germany" embodies German Nazism.

In later years his poetry became progressively more cryptic, fractured and monosyllabic, bearing comparison to the music of [[Anton Webern]]. He also increased his use of German [[neologism]]s, especially in his later works ''[[Fadensonnen]]'' ("Threadsuns") and ''[[Lichtzwang]]''. In the eyes of some, Celan attempted in his poetry either to destroy or remake the German language. For others, he retained a sense for the lyricism of the German language which was rare in writers of that time. As he writes in a letter to his wife Gisèle Lestrange on one of his trips to Germany: "The German I talk is not the same as the language the German people are talking here". Writing in German was a way for him to think back and remember his parents, particularly his mother, from whom he had learned the language. This is underlined in "{{Lang|de|Wolfsbohne}}" (Lupin), a poem in which Paul Celan addresses his mother. The urgency and power of Celan's work stem from his attempt to find words "after", to bear (impossible) witness in a language that gives back no words "for that which happened".

In addition to writing poetry (in German and, earlier, in Romanian), he was an extremely active translator and [[polyglot]], translating literature from Romanian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Russian, Hebrew, and English into German.

==Awards==
* [[Literaturpreis der Stadt Bremen|Bremen Literature Prize]] 1958
* [[Georg Büchner Prize]] 1960

== Significance ==
Based on the reception of his work, it could be suggested that Celan, along with [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Friedrich Hölderlin|Hölderlin]] and [[Rainer Maria Rilke|Rilke]], is one of the most significant German poets who ever lived.<ref>{{cite book|year=2012|editor-last=May|editor-first=Markus|editor2-last=Goßens|editor2-first=Peter|editor3-last=Lehmann|editor3-first=Jürgen|title=Celan Handbuch|doi=10.1007/978-3-476-05331-2|isbn=978-3-476-02441-1}}</ref> Despite the difficulty of his work, his poetry is thoroughly researched, the total number of scholarly papers numbering in the thousands. Many contemporary philosophers, including [[Maurice Blanchot]], [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] and others have devoted at least one of their books to his writing.<ref>{{cite book |title=Breathturn into timestead : the collected later poetry : a bilingual edition |last=Celan, Paul |others=[[Pierre Joris|Joris, Pierre]]|isbn=978-0-374-12598-1 |edition=first |location=New York|oclc=869263618|date = 2 December 2014}}</ref>

About translating David Rokeah from Hebrew, Celan wrote: "David Rokeah was here for two days, I have translated two poems for him, mediocre stuff, and given him comments on other German translation, suggested improvements ... I was glad, probably in the wrong place, to be able to decipher and translate a Hebrew text."<ref>''The Correspondence of Paul Celan & Ilana Shmueli'', The Sheep Meadow Press, New York, Letter 99, pp. 103–104</ref>
