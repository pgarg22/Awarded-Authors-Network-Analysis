'''Utpal Dutta''' (উৎপল দত্ত) ({{audio|Bn-উৎপল দত্ত.oga|listen}}) (29 March 1929 – 19 August 1993) was an Indian actor, director, and writer-playwright. He was primarily an actor in [[Bengali theatre]], where he became a pioneering figure in Modern [[Indian theatre]], when he founded the "Little Theatre Group" in 1949. This group enacted many English, [[Shakespearean]] and Brecht plays, in a period now known as the "Epic theatre" period, before it immersed itself completely in highly political and radical theatre. His plays became an apt vehicle for the expression of his Marxist ideologies, visible in socio-political plays such as ''Kallol'' (1965), ''Manusher Adhikar'', ''Louha Manob'' (1964), ''Tiner Toloar'' and ''Maha-Bidroha''. He also acted in over 100 [[Bengali language|Bengali]] and [[Hindi]] films in a career spanning 40 years, and remains most known for his roles in films such as [[Mrinal Sen]]’s ''[[Bhuvan Shome]]'' (1969), [[Satyajit Ray]]’s ''[[Agantuk]]'' (1991), [[Gautam Ghose]]’s ''[[Padma Nadir Majhi]]'' (1993) and [[Hrishikesh Mukherjee]]'s breezy Hindi comedies such as ''[[Gol Maal]]'' (1979) and ''[[Rang Birangi]]'' (1983).<ref name=ut>[http://www.livemint.com/2009/07/03220356/Inside-the-actor8217s-mind.html Inside the actor's mind] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708090426/http://www.livemint.com/2009/07/03220356/Inside-the-actor8217s-mind.html |date=8 July 2009 }} [[Mint (newspaper)]], 3 July 2009.</ref><ref name=uti>[http://www.screenindia.com/old/fullstory.php?content_id=8842 Remembering Utpal Dutt]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Shoma A Chatterji, [[Screen (magazine)]], 20 August 2004.</ref><ref>{{usurped|[https://web.archive.org/web/20071021104436/http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1812/18120800.htm The Mirror of Class: Essays on Bengali Theatre by Himani Bannerji]}} [[Frontline (magazine)]], Volume 18 – Issue 12, 9–22 Jun 2001.</ref><ref name=te>[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060826/asp/calcutta/story_6659630.asp Stage On & Off: Man in iron mask] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023163613/http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060826/asp/calcutta/story_6659630.asp |date=23 October 2012 }} [[The Telegraph (Kolkata)]], 26 August 2006.</ref> He also did the role of a sculptor, Sir Digindra Narayan, in the episode ''Seemant Heera'' of [[Byomkesh Bakshi (TV series)]] on [[Doordarshan]] in 1993, shortly before his death.

He received [[National Film Award for Best Actor]] in 1970 and three [[Filmfare Best Comedian Award]]s. In 1990, the [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]], India's National Academy of Music, Dance and Theatre, awarded him its highest award, the [[List of Sangeet Natak Akademi fellows|Sangeet Natak Akademi Fellowship]] for lifetime contribution to theatre.

==Early life and education==

Utpal Dutta was born on 29 March 1929 in [[Barisal]]. His father was Girijaranjan Dutta. He studied from the famous [[St. Lawrence High School, Kolkata]] He graduated with English Literature Honours from [[St. Xavier's College, Calcutta]], [[University of Calcutta]].<ref name=inde>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-utpal-dutt-1462531.html Obituary: Utpal Dutt] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022201827/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-utpal-dutt-1462531.html |date=22 October 2017 }} ''[[The Independent]]'', 21 August 1993.</ref>

==Career==

Though he was active primarily in Bengali theatre, he started his career in English theatre. As a teenager in the 1940s, he developed his passion and craft in English theatre, which resulted in the establishment of "The Shakespeareans" in 1947. Its first performance was a powerful production of Shakespeare's [[Richard III (play)|Richard III]], with Dutt playing the king. This so impressed [[Geoffrey Kendal]] and Laura Kendal (parents of the actress [[Jennifer Kendal]]), who led the itinerant "Shakespeareana Theatre Company", that they immediately hired him, and he did two year-long tours with them across India and Pakistan, enacting Shakespeare's plays, first 1947–49 and later 1953–54; and was acclaimed for his passionate portrayal of [[Othello]]. After the Kendals left India for the first time in 1949, Utpal Dutt renamed his group the "Little Theatre Group" (LTG), and over the next three years, continued to perform and produce plays by Ibsen, Shaw, Tagore, Gorky and Konstantin Simonov. The group later decided to stage exclusively Bengali plays and to eventually evolve into a production company that would produce several Bengali movies. He also remained an active member of ''[[Gananatya|Gananatya Sangha]]'', which performed through rural areas of West Bengal.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=qYfH1tOwsHcC&pg=PA383&dq=Utpal+Dutt&as_brr=0#v=onepage&q=Utpal%20Dutt&f=false Utpal Dutt] ''The Columbia encyclopedia of modern drama, Volume 1'', by Gabrielle H. Cody, Evert Sprinchorn. [[Columbia University Press]], 2007. {{ISBN|0231144229}}. ''Page 382-383''.</ref>

He was also a founding member of [[Indian People's Theatre Association]] (IPTA), an organisation known for its leftist leaning, but left it after a couple of years, when he started his theatre group. He wrote and directed what he called "Epic Theatre", a term he borrowed from [[Bertolt Brecht]], to bring about discussion and change in Bengal. His Brecht Society, formed in 1948, was presided by Satyajit Ray. He became one of the most influential personalities in the Group Theatre movement. While accepting Brecht's belief of the audience being "co-authors" of the theatre, he rejected orthodoxies of "Epic theatre" as being impractical in India.<ref name=the>[https://books.google.com/books?id=mLQaz-12Eo8C&pg=PA114&lpg=PA114&dq=Utpal+Dutt+theatre&source=bl&ots=Jl1Ezt3DAT&sig=8Sv94RGcGbjjhkQM6XIKgu7ACkY&hl=en&ei=Kr7ASprrJ9Oe8Absx6ilAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2#v=onepage&q=Utpal%20Dutt%20theatre&f=false Utpal Dutt]''Theatres of independence: drama, theory, and urban performance in India since 1947:Studies in theatre history and culture'' by Aparna Bhargava Dharwadker. University of Iowa Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0-87745-961-4}}. ''Page 114''</ref> He also remained a teacher of English at the [[South Point School (India)|South Point School]] in Kolkata.

Soon he would turn to his native [[Bengali theatre|Bengali]], producing translations of several Shakespearean tragedies and the works of Russian classicists into Bengali. Starting in 1954, he wrote and directed controversial Bengali political plays, and also [[Maxim Gorky]]'s ''Lower Depths'' in Bengali in 1957. In 1959, the LTG secured the lease of [[Minerva Theatre, Kolkata]], where most notably ''Angar'' (Coal) (1959), based on the exploitation of coal-miners was showcased. For the next decade the group staged several plays here, with him as an impresario, and he still is remembered as one of the last pioneering actor-managers of [[Indian theatre]]. He also formed groups like ''Arjo Opera'' and ''Bibek Yatra Samaj''.<ref name=inde/>

Meanwhile, his transition to films happened while performing the role of [[Othello]], when famous filmmaker Madhu Bose happened to be watching, and gave him the lead in his film ''Michael Madhusudan'' (1950), based on the life of the revolutionary Indian poet [[Michael Madhusudan Dutt]]. Later, he himself wrote a play on the fragmented colonial psyche of Michael Madhusudan Dutt, and the ambivalence of swaying between "colonial" admiration and "anti-colonial" revolt. He went on to act in many [[Bengali language|Bengali]] films, including many films by [[Satyajit Ray]].<ref name=uti/>

Dutt was also an extremely famous comic actor in [[Hindi cinema]], though he acted in only a handful of Hindi films. He acted in comedy movies, the most notable ones being ''[[Guddi (1971 film)|Guddi]]'', ''[[Gol Maal]]'', ''[[Naram Garam]]'', ''[[Rang Birangi]]'' and ''[[Shaukeen]]''. He received [[Filmfare Best Comedian Award]] for ''Golmaal'', ''Naram Garam'' and ''Rang Birangi''. He appeared in ''[[Bhuvan Shome]]'', (for which he was awarded the [[National Film Award (India)|National Film Award]] for Best Actor), ''Ek Adhuri Kahani'' and ''Chorus'', all by [[Mrinal Sen]]; ''[[Agantuk]]'', ''[[Jana Aranya]]'', ''[[Joi Baba Felunath (film)|Joi Baba Felunath]]'' and ''[[Hirak Rajar Deshe]]'', by [[Satyajit Ray]]; ''Paar'' and ''[[Padma Nadir Majhi]]'', by [[Gautam Ghose]]; ''[[Bombay Talkie]]'', ''[[The Guru (1969 film)|The Guru]]'', and ''[[Shakespeare Wallah]]'', by [[James Ivory (director)|James Ivory]]; ''[[Jukti Takko Aar Gappo]]'', by [[Ritwik Ghatak]]; ''[[Guddi (1971 film)|Guddi]]'', ''[[Gol Maal]]'' and ''[[Kotwal Saab]]'' by [[Hrishikesh Mukherjee]]; ''[[Swami (1977 film)|Shaukeen]]'', ''[[Priyatama]]'' and ''[[Hamari Bahu Alka]]''  directed by [[Basu Chatterjee]] and ''[[Amanush]]'', ''[[Anand Ashram]]'' and ''[[Barsaat Ki Ek Raat]]'' by [[Shakti Samanta]].

Utpal Dutt also played the main villain characters in some of the major successful [[Amitabh Bachchan]] starrers such as [[The Great Gambler]], [[Inquilaab (1984 film)|Inquilaab (film)]] and the bilingual Hindi/Bangla movie [[Barsaat Ki Ek Raat]]. In fact, Utpal Dutt was the Hero (main lead) in Amitabh Bachchan's maiden venture [[Saat Hindustani]].

He balanced successful parallel careers as an extremely serious theatre playwright and director in Bengal alongside doing hilariously comic roles in Hindi cinema. He is the greatest dramatist in progressive Bengali theatre of the 20th century.

Dutt was also a lifelong Marxist and an active supporter of the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/poll-bound-bengal-turns-to-artistes/351483/|title=Poll-bound Bengal turns to artistes|date=11 March 2009|author=Saubhadro Chatterji|publisher=[[Business Standard]]|access-date=13 March 2009|archive-date=16 March 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316143816/http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/poll-bound-bengal-turns-to-artistes/351483/|url-status=live}}</ref> and his leftist "Revolutionary Theatre" was a phenomenon in the contemporary Bengali theatre. He staged many street dramas in favour of the Communist Party. He was jailed by the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] government in West Bengal in 1965 and detained for several months, as the then state government feared that the subversive message of his play ''Kallol'' (Sound of the Waves), (based on the [[Royal Indian Navy Mutiny]] of 1946, which ran packed shows at Calcutta's Minerva Theatre), might provoke anti-government protests in West Bengal. The play turned out to be his longest-running play at the Minerva. ''Manusher Adhikare'' (Of People's Rights) in 1968, staged as a documentary drama, was a new genre in [[Bengali theatre]] before, though it turned out to be his last production of the group at the Minerva, as they soon left the theatre. Thereafter, the group was given the name the "People's Little Theatre"; as it took on yet another new direction, his work came closer to the people, and this phase played an important role in popularising Indian street theatre, as he started performing at street-corners or "poster" plays, in open spaces, without any aid or embellishment, before enormous crowds. The year also marked his transition into ''[[Jatra (Bengal)|Jatra]]'' or ''Yatra Pala'', a Bengali folk drama form, performed largely across rural West Bengal. He started writing Jatra scripts, produced and acted in them, even formed his own Jatra troupe. His jatra political dramas were often produced on open-air stages and symbolised his commitment to communist ideology, and today form his lasting legacy.<ref>''Rehearsals of revolution: the political theater of Bengal'', by Rustom Bharucha. University of Hawaii Press, 1984. {{ISBN|0-8248-0845-2}}. ''Page 55''.</ref>

Through the 1970s three of his plays; ''Barricade'', ''Dusswapner Nagari'' (City of Nightmares) and ''Ebaar Rajar Pala'' (Now it is the King's turn), drew crowds despite being officially banned.<ref name=ut/><ref name=inde/><ref>[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0E13FC3F5A157A93C7AB178AD95F418685F9 Pro-Communist Drama Gets Crowds in Calcutta] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022150955/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0E13FC3F5A157A93C7AB178AD95F418685F9 |date=22 October 2012 }} [[New York Times]], 25 November 1965.</ref><ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/174687/Utpal-Dutt Encyclopædia Britannica article on Utpal Dutt] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214120728/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/174687/Utpal-Dutt |date=14 February 2009 }} [[Britannica.com]].</ref>

He wrote ''Louha Manab'' (The Iron Man), in 1964 while still in jail, based on a real trial against a pro-Stalin, ex-Politburo member by supporters of [[Nikita Khrushchev]] in Moscow of 1963. It was first staged at [[Alipore Jail]] in 1965, by the People's Little Theatre. His stay in jail unleashed a new period of rebellious and politically charged plays, including ''Tiner Toloar'' (The Tin Sword), partially based on ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'', ''Dushapner Nagari'' (Nightmare City), ''Manusher Odhikare'' (Rights Of Man), based on the [[Scottsboro Boys]] case, protests against the racial discrimination and injustice of the [[Scottsboro Boys#Scottsboro trials|Scottsborough]] trial of 1931, ''Surya-Shikar'' (Hunting the Sun) (1978), ''Maha-Bidroha'' (The Great Rebellion) (1989), and ''Laal Durgo'' (Red Fort) (1990) about the demise of Communism, set in a fictitious East European country, and ''Janatar Aphim'' (Opiate of the People), (1990) lamented on Indian political parties exploiting religion for gain.<ref name=te/> In all, he wrote twenty-two full-length plays, fifteen poster plays, nineteen Jatra scripts, acted in thousands of shows, and directed more than sixty productions, apart from writing serious studies of Shakespeare, Girish Ghosh, Stanislavsky, Brecht, and revolutionary theatre, and translating Shakespeare and Brecht.

He also directed a number of films such as ''Megh'' (1961), a psychological thriller, ''Ghoom Bhangar Gaan'' (1965), ''Jhar'' (Storm) (1979), based on the Young Bengal movement, ''Baisakhi Megh'' (1981), ''Maa'' (1983) and ''Inquilab Ke Baad'' (1984).

Forty years after the staging of the classic play ''Kallol'' which entails the story of the mutiny of Indian sailors against the British on the Arabian Sea, for which he was even imprisoned, was revived in 2005, as ''Gangabokshe Kallol'', part of the state-funded "Utpal Dutt Natyotsav" (Utpal Dutt Theatre Festival), on an off-shore stage, by the [[Hooghly River]] in Kolkata.<ref>[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1051105/asp/calcutta/story_5437423.asp Dutt's Kallol to ride the Hooghly] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023163557/http://www.telegraphindia.com/1051105/asp/calcutta/story_5437423.asp |date=23 October 2012 }} [[The Telegraph (Kolkata)]], 5 November 2005.</ref>
