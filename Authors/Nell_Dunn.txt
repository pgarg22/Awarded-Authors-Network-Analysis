She is known especially for a volume of short stories, ''[[Up the Junction]]'', and a novel, ''[[Poor Cow (novel)|Poor Cow]]''.

==Early years==
The second daughter of [[Philip Gordon Dunn, 2nd Baronet Dunn|Sir Philip Dunn]] and maternal granddaughter of the [[James St Clair-Erskine, 5th Earl of Rosslyn|5th Earl of Rosslyn]], Dunn was born in London and educated at a convent up to the age of 14. She and her older sister Serena were evacuated to America in the war. Her parents divorced in 1944.<ref name=":1"/>

Her father did not believe his daughters needed qualifications. As a result she has never passed an exam in her life. She only learnt to read at nine years old. Dunn said, "Whenever my father saw my appalling spelling, he would laugh. But it wasn't an unkind laugh. In his laugh there was the message, 'You are a completely original person, and everything you do has your own mark on it.' He wanted us all to be unique."<ref>{{Cite web |date=2013-10-13 |title=Nell Dunn: I never used to think about death, until I was 50. |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/nell-dunn-i-never-used-to-think-about-death-until-i-was-50-i-was-never-going-to-die-i-was-immortal-but-now-i-think-about-death-every-day-105000.html |access-date=2021-03-31 |website=The Independent|language=en}}</ref> 

Despite her upper-class background, Dunn moved in 1959 to [[Battersea]], made friends there and worked for a time in a sweet factory. This milieu inspired much of what Dunn would later write.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last1=Ironside |first1=Virginia |title=Nell Dunn: I never used to think about death, until I was 50.

==Career==
After her marriage to [[Jeremy Sandford]] in 1957, they gave up their smart [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] home and went to live in unfashionable [[Battersea]] where they joined and observed the lower strata of society. From this experience he published the play ''[[Cathy Come Home]]'' in 1963, and she wrote ''[[Up the Junction]]''.

Dunn came to notice with the publication of ''[[Up the Junction]]'' (1963), a series of short stories set in South London, some of which had already appeared in the ''[[New Statesman]]''. The book, awarded the [[John Llewellyn Rhys Prize]], was a controversial success at the time for its vibrant, realistic and non-judgemental portrait of its working-class protagonists. It was [[Up the Junction (The Wednesday Play)|adapted for television]] by Dunn, with [[Ken Loach]], for ''[[The Wednesday Play]]'' series, directed by Loach and broadcast in November 1965. A [[Up the Junction (film)|cinema film version]] was released in 1968.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062426/ IMDB. Retrieved 25 April 2020.]</ref>

''Talking to Women'' (1965) was a collection of interviews with nine friends, "from society heiresses to factory workers (Dunn herself was both)".<ref name=Webb>Kate Webb, [https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/public/something-to-say-for-herself/ Something to say for herself: hearing and recording female voices], ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'', July 17, 2018.</ref> The interviewees included [[Edna O’Brien]], [[Pauline Boty]], [[Ann Quin]] and [[Paddy Kitchen]].<ref name=Webb/> Dunn's first novel, ''[[Poor Cow (novel)|Poor Cow]]'' (1967) was made into a film in the same year, starring [[Carol White]] and [[Terence Stamp]], under Loach's direction.

Her later books are ''Grandmothers'' (1991) and ''My Silver Shoes'' (1996). Dunn's first play ''[[Steaming (play)|Steaming]]'' was produced in 1981 and a television film ''Every Breath You Take'' in 1987. She also wrote ''Sisters'', a film script commissioned by the BBC.

She won the 1982 [[Susan Smith Blackburn Prize]] for her play ''Steaming''.<ref>{{Cite news |date=1982-02-23 |title=Englishwoman Wins Blackburn Play Prize |language=en-US |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/23/theater/englishwoman-wins-blackburn-play-prize.html|access-date=2021-03-31 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Dunn was married to writer [[Jeremy Sandford]] from 1957<ref name=":0"/> to 1979, and they had three sons. For some time the family lived on a small [[hill farm]] called Wern Watkin, outside [[Crickhowell]] in South Wales. Their farm is mentioned in a 2000 biography by their neighbour, the young [[Carlo Gébler]], son of novelist [[Edna O'Brien]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gébler|first1=Carlo|url=https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Father_And_I/dtPJI7Bj1YQC|title=Father and I: A Memoir|publisher=Little, Brown|year=2000|isbn=9781405529341|author-link=Carlo Gébler|access-date=31 May 2021}}</ref>
