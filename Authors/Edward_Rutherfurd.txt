'''Edward Rutherfurd''' is a [[pen name]] for '''Francis Edward Wintle'''<ref name="Stanford" /> (born 1948 in [[Salisbury]], England). He is best known as a writer of epic historical novels which span long periods of history but are set in particular places. His [[debut novel]] ''[[Sarum (novel)|Sarum]]'' set the pattern for his work with a ten-thousand-year storyline.

==Biography==
Rutherfurd attended the [[University of Cambridge]] and [[Stanford Business School]], where he earned a [[Sloan Fellows|Sloan fellowship]].<ref name="Stanford">{{cite web |url=https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/stanford-gsb-experience/news-history/sloan-graduates-take-road-less-traveled |title=Sloan Graduates Take the Road Less Traveled |last1=Pimentel |first1=Ben |website=Stanford Graduate School of Business |access-date=5 March 2016}}</ref><ref name="WebBiog">{{cite web |url=http://edwardrutherfurd.com/biography |title=Biography |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=Edward Rutherfurd Official Website |access-date=5 March 2016}}</ref> After graduating he worked in political research, bookselling and publishing.<ref name="WebBiog" /> He abandoned his career in the book trade in 1983 and returned to his childhood home to write ''[[Sarum (novel)|Sarum]]'', a historical novel with a ten-thousand year story, set in the area around the ancient monument of [[Stonehenge]] and [[Salisbury]].<ref name="Sarum">{{cite book |last=Rutherfurd |first=Edward |date=1987 |title=Sarum |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SOAdNO6I9jEC |publisher=Random House |isbn=9780099527305}}</ref>

''Sarum'' was published in 1987 and became an instant international best-seller, remaining for 23 weeks on the [[New York Times Bestseller List]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Since then he produced seven more New York Times best-sellers: ''[[Russka (novel)|Russka]]'', a novel of Russia; ''[[London (novel)|London]]''; ''[[The Forest (novel)|The Forest]]'', set in England's [[New Forest]] which lies close by Sarum; two novels, ''[[Dublin: Foundation]]'' (''The Princes of Ireland'') and ''[[Ireland: Awakening]]'' (''The Rebels of Ireland''), which cover the story of Ireland from the time just before [[Saint Patrick]] to the twentieth century;  ''[[New York (novel)|New York]]''; and ''[[Paris (novel)|Paris]]''.

His books have sold more than fifteen million copies and been translated into twenty languages.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.edwardrutherfurd.com/biography|title=Edward Rutherfurd &#124;&#124; Biography &#124;&#124; Official Site}}</ref> Rutherfurd settled near [[Dublin]], Ireland in the early 1990s, but currently divides his time between Europe and North America.<ref name="WebBiog" />

In 2015 Edward Rutherfurd was the recipient of the City of [[Zaragoza]]'s International Historical Novel Honor Award "for his body of work in the field of the historical novel."<ref name="Zaragoza">{{cite web |url=https://www.zaragoza.es/ciudad/noticias/detalle_Noticia?id=222048 |title=Vanessa Montfort and Edward Rutherfurd, recipients of the XI International Historical Novel Prize "City of Zaragoza" |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=Zaragoza City Council News |date=20 May 2006 |access-date=5 March 2016}}</ref>

==Style==
Rutherfurd invents four to six fictional families and tells the stories of their descendants. Using this framework, he chronicles the history of a place, often from the beginning of civilisation to modern times - a kind of historical fiction inspired by the work of [[James Michener]].<ref name="TodInter">{{cite web |url=https://historicalnovelsociety.org/edward-rutherfurd-talks-paris-michener-and-the-ebb-and-flow-of-historical-fiction-with-mary-tod/ |title=Edward Rutherfurd talks ''Paris'', the creative process and the ebb and flow of historical fiction with Mary Tod |last1=Tod |first1=Mary |date=2013 |website=[[Historical Novel Society]] |access-date=5 March 2016}}</ref>

Rutherfurd's novels are generally at least 500 pages and sometimes even over 1,000. Divided into a number of parts, each chapter represents a different era in the area of the novel's history. There is usually an extensive family tree in the introduction, and each generational line matches with the corresponding chapters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stevenhsilver.com/newyork.html |title=Review of ''New York'' by Edward Rutherfurd |last1=Silver |first1=Steven H |date= November 2009 |website=SF Site |access-date=5 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edwardrutherfurd.com/Excerpts/Paris%20Family%20Tree.pdf |title=Family Tree from ''Paris'' |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=Edward Rutherfurd Official Site |access-date=5 March 2016 }}
