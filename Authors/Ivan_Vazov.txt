The works of Ivan Vazov reveal two historical epochs - the Bulgarian Renaissance and the Post-Liberation (from Ottoman Empire rule) epoch. Ivan Vazov holds the highest honorary title of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences - Academician. He acted as Education and People Enlightenment Minister from September 7, 1897 until January 30, 1899, representing the People's Party.

==Biography and major works==
The exact date of Vazov's birth is disputed. His parents, Saba and Mincho Vazov, both had a lot of influence on the young poet.

After Ivan finished primary school in Sopot, Mincho sent him to [[Kalofer]], appointing him{{what|date=September 2020}} assistant teacher. Having done his final exams in Kalofer, the young teacher returned to Sopot to help in his father's grocery. The following year his father sent him to Plovdiv to [[Naiden Gerov]]'s school. There Vazov made his first steps as a poet.

He returned to Sopot only to leave for [[Oltenița]] in [[Romania]], as his father wanted him to become an apprentice and study trade at his uncle's. Ivan Vazov showed no interest in the trade profession whatsoever. Instead he was immersed in literature. Soon he fled from his uncle's place and went to [[Brăila]] where he lived with the Bulgarian exiled revolutionaries and met [[Hristo Botev]], a Bulgarian [[revolutionary]] and poet.

In 1874, he joined [[Liberation of Bulgaria|the struggle for his country's independence]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]]. He returned to Sopot in 1875, where he became a member of the local revolutionary committee. After the failure of the [[April Uprising]] of 1876, he had to flee the country, going back to [[Galaţi]], where most of the surviving revolutionaries were exiled. There he was appointed a secretary of the committee.

Vazov was probably heavily influenced by Botev, who was the ideological leader of the Bulgarian revolutionary movement. He started writing his famous poems with Botev and some other Bulgarian emigrants in Romania. In 1876 he published his first work, ''[[Priaporetz and Gusla]]'', followed by "[[Bulgaria's Sorrows]]" in 1877.

Bulgaria regained its independence in 1878 as a result of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War]] and Vazov wrote the famous ''[[Epic of the Forgotten]]''. He became the editor of the political reviews ''Science'' and ''Dawn''. He was, however, forced into exile once again, this time to [[Odessa]], because of the persecution of the russophile political faction. Returning to Bulgaria with the help of his mother Suba Vazova, he started teaching. Vazov's next stay was in [[Svishtov]], where he became a [[civil servant]].

He moved to [[Sofia]] in 1889 where he started publishing the review ''Dennitsa''.

Vazov's 1888 novel ''[[Under the Yoke]]'', which depicts the Ottoman oppression of Bulgaria, is the most famous piece of classic Bulgarian literature and has been translated into over 30 languages.<ref>See {{cite book |last=Vazoff |first=Ivan |title=Under the Yoke: A Romance of Bulgarian Liberty with An Introduction by Edmund Gosse |publisher= William Heinemann |place=London |year= 1912|url= https://archive.org/details/underyokeromance00vazorich|access-date= 17 June 2018 |via= Internet Archive}}</ref>

Later in his life Vazov was a prominent and widely respected figure in the social and cultural life of newly independent Bulgaria. He died on September 22, 1921.

==Other famous works==
Some of the other famous works by Vazov include the novels ''New Country'' (1894), ''Under Our Heaven'' (1900), ''The Empress of Kazalar'' (1902), ''[[Songs of Macedonia]]'' (1914), '' [[It Will Not Perish]] '' (1920) and the plays ''Vagabonds'' (1894), ''[[A&nbsp;Newspaperman?]]'' (1900), ''Borislav'' (1909) and ''Ivaylo'' (1911).

Vazov also wrote the first Bulgarian [[science fiction]] story ''[[The Last Day of XX Century]]'' (1899), the first Bulgarian [[fantasy]] poem ''[[In the Kingdom of the Fairies]]'' (1884) and some other fantasy poetry.<ref>http://sf-sofia.com/forum/index.php?p=47589&rb_v=viewtopic#p47589</ref>

==Historical site==

Vazov's home in Sofia has been turned into a museum, containing a restoration of his residence with period furnishings, as well as Vazov's taxidermically preserved dog.  Although the museum is ostensibly open Tuesday through Saturday, it is in practice not always staffed, so visitors are advised to call in advance.  The museum is located at the corner of Ivan Vazov Street and [[Georgi Sava Rakovski|Georgi S. Rakovski]] Street in Sofia.

==Honours==
The Bulgarian [[Ivan Vazov National Theatre]] in Sofia is named after him, the "Ivan Vazov" neighborhood in [[Sofia]], as is the [[Ivan Vazov National Library]] ({{lang-bg|Народна библиотека "Иван Вазов"}}) in Plovdiv. A park near [[Hagia Sophia Church (Sofia)|St. Sofia Church]] in Sofia features the city's best-known monument to Vazov.

Vazovova Street in [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Vazov Point]] and [[Vazov Rock]] on [[Livingston Island]] in the [[South Shetland Islands]], [[Antarctica]] are also named after him.<ref>[https://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/scar/display_name.cfm?gaz_id=134675 Vazov Point] [https://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/scar/ SCAR Composite Gazetteer of Antarctica]</ref>
