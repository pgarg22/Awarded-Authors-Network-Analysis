'''Anne Brontë''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|ɒ|n|t|i}}, <small>commonly</small> {{IPAc-en|-|t|eɪ}};<ref>As given by ''Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature'' (Merriam-Webster, incorporated, Publishers: Springfield, Massachusetts, 1995), p viii: "When our research shows that an author's pronunciation of his or her name differs from common usage, the author's pronunciation is listed first, and the descriptor ''commonly'' precedes the more familiar pronunciation." See also entries on Anne, Charlotte and Emily Brontë, pp 175–176.</ref> 17 January 1820 – 28 May 1849) was an English novelist and poet, and the youngest member of the [[Brontë family|Brontë literary family]].

Anne Brontë was the daughter of [[Patrick Brontë]], a poor Irish clergyman in the [[Church of England]]. Anne lived most of her life with her family at the parish of [[Haworth]] on the Yorkshire moors. Otherwise she attended a boarding school in [[Mirfield]] between 1836 and 1837, and between 1839 and 1845 lived elsewhere working as a governess. In 1846 she published [[Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell|a book of poems with her sisters]] and later two novels, initially under the pen name Acton Bell. Her first novel, ''[[Agnes Grey]]'', was published in 1847 with ''[[Wuthering Heights]]''. Her second novel, ''[[The Tenant of Wildfell Hall]]'', was published in 1848. ''The Tenant of Wildfell Hall'' is thought to be one of the first [[Feminism|feminist]] novels.<ref name="intro">{{cite book|last=Davies|first=Stevie|title=The Tenant of Wildfell Hall|chapter=Introduction and Notes|year=1996|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-043474-3|url=https://archive.org/details/tenantofwildfell00bron}}</ref>

Anne died at 29, probably of [[pulmonary tuberculosis]]. After Anne's death her sister [[Charlotte Brontë|Charlotte]] edited ''Agnes Grey'' to fix issues with its first edition, but prevented republication of ''The Tenant of Wildfell Hall''. This is one reason why Anne is not as well known as her sisters. Nonetheless both of Anne's novels are considered classics of [[English literature]].

==Family background==
[[File:Anne Brontë by Patrick Branwell Brontë restored.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Anne, from a group portrait by her brother [[Branwell Brontë|Branwell]]]]
Anne's father was [[Patrick Brontë]] (1777–1861). Patrick Brontë was born in a two-room cottage in Emdale, [[Loughbrickland]], [[County Down]], Ireland.<ref name="Fraser 4">Fraser, ''The Brontës'', p. 4</ref><ref name="Barker 3">Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 3</ref> He was the oldest of ten children born to Hugh Brunty and Eleanor McCrory, poor Irish peasant farmers.<ref name="Barker 2">Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 2</ref> The family surname, ''mac Aedh Ó Proinntigh'', was [[Anglicisation|Anglicised]] as Prunty or Brunty.<ref name="Fraser 4"/> Struggling against poverty, Patrick learned to read and write, and from 1798 taught others. In 1802, at 25, he won a place to study theology at [[St. John's College, Cambridge]]. Here he changed his name, Brunty, to the more distinguished sounding Brontë. In 1807 he was ordained in the priesthood in the Church of England.<ref name="Barker 14">Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 14</ref> He served as a [[curate]] in Essex and then in Wellington, Shropshire. In 1810 he published his first poem, ''Winter Evening Thoughts'', in a local newspaper.<ref name="Barker 41">Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 41</ref> In 1811 he published a collection of moral verse, ''Cottage Poems''.<ref name="Barker 43">Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 43</ref> Also in 1811 he became vicar of St. Peter's Church in [[Hartshead]], Yorkshire.<ref name="Barker 36">Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 36</ref> In 1812 he was appointed an examiner in Classics at [[Woodhouse Grove School]], near [[Bradford]]. This was a [[John Wesley|Wesleyan]] academy where, at 35, he met his future wife, the headmaster's niece, [[Maria Branwell]].

Maria Branwell (1783–1821), Anne's mother, was the daughter of Anne Carne, the daughter of a silversmith, and Thomas Branwell, a successful and property-owning grocer and tea merchant in [[Penzance]].<ref name="Fraser 12 -13">Fraser, ''The Brontës'', pp. 12–13</ref> Maria was the eleventh of twelve children and enjoyed the benefits of a prosperous family in a small town. After the death of her parents, Maria went to help her aunt with housekeeping functions at the school. Maria was intelligent and well read,<ref name="Fraser 15">Fraser, ''The Brontës'', p. 15</ref> and her strong [[Methodist]] faith attracted Patrick Brontë, whose own leanings were similar.<ref name="Barker 48">Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 48</ref>

Within three months, on 29 December 1812, though from considerably different backgrounds, Patrick Brontë and Maria Branwell were married.<ref name="Fraser 16">Fraser, ''The Brontës'', p. 16</ref> Their first child, Maria (1814–1825), was born after they moved to [[Hartshead]]. In 1815 Patrick was appointed curate of the chapel in Market Street [[Thornton, West Yorkshire|Thornton]], near [[Bradford]]. A second daughter, Elizabeth (1815–1825), was born shortly after.<ref name="Barker 61">Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 61</ref> Four more children followed: [[Charlotte Brontë|Charlotte]] (1816–1855), [[Branwell Brontë|Patrick Branwell]] (1817–1848), [[Emily Brontë|Emily]] (1818–1848), and Anne (1820–1849).

==Early life==
Anne was the youngest of the Brontë children. She was born on 17 January 1820 on the outskirts of [[Bradford]].<ref name="Barker 86">Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 86</ref> Her father, Patrick, was curate there. Anne was baptised there on 25 March 1820. Later Patrick was appointed to the perpetual curacy in Haworth, a small town {{convert|7|mi|km|spell=in}} away. In April 1820 the family moved into the five-roomed Haworth Parsonage.

When Anne was barely a year old her mother, Maria, became ill, probably with [[uterine cancer]].<ref name="Barker 102 -104">Barker, ''The Brontës'', pp. 102–104</ref> Maria Branwell died on 15 September 1821.<ref name="Fraser 28">Fraser, ''The Brontës'', p. 28</ref> Patrick tried to remarry, without success.<ref name="Fraser 30">Fraser, ''The Brontës'', p. 30</ref> Maria's sister, Elizabeth Branwell (1776–1842), had moved to the parsonage initially for Maria, but spent the rest of her life there raising Maria's children. She did it from a sense of duty. She was stern and expected respect, not love.<ref name="Fraser 29">Fraser, ''The Brontës'', p. 29</ref> There was little affection between her and the older children. According to tradition Anne was her favourite.

In [[Elizabeth Gaskell]]'s biography of Charlotte, Patrick remembered Anne as precocious. Patrick said that when Anne was four years old he had asked her what a child most wanted and that she had said: "age and experience".<ref name=" Fraser 31">Fraser, ''The Brontës'', p. 31</ref>

In summer 1824 Patrick sent daughters Maria, Elizabeth, Charlotte, and Emily to Crofton Hall in [[Crofton, West Yorkshire]], and subsequently to the Clergy Daughter's School at [[Cowan Bridge]] in Lancashire.<ref name="Fraser 35">Fraser, ''The Brontës'', p. 35</ref> Maria and Elizabeth Brontë died of consumption on 6 May and 15 June 1825 respectively, and Charlotte and Emily were brought home.<ref name=" Fraser 31"/> The unexpected deaths distressed the family so much that Patrick could not face sending them away again. They were educated at home for the next five years, largely by Elizabeth Branwell and Patrick.<ref name="Fraser 44-45">Fraser, ''The Brontës'', pp. 44–45</ref> The children made little attempt to mix with others outside the parsonage and relied on each other for company. The bleak moors surrounding Haworth became their playground. Anne shared a room with her aunt, Elizabeth. They were close, and she may have influenced Anne's personality and religious beliefs.<ref name="Gérin 35">Gérin, ''Anne Brontë'', p. 35</ref>

==Education==
[[File:Anne Bronte.jpg|thumb|Anne Brontë, by [[Charlotte Brontë]], 1834]]
Anne's studies at home included music and drawing. The Keighley church organist gave piano lessons to Anne and Emily and Branwell, and John Bradley of Keighley gave them art lessons. Each drew with some skill.<ref name="Barker 150">Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 150</ref> Their aunt tried to teach the girls how to run a household, but they inclined more to literature.<ref name="Fraser 45">Fraser, ''The Brontës'', p. 45</ref> They read much from their father's well-stocked library. Their reading included the Bible, [[Homer]], [[Virgil]], [[Shakespeare]], [[John Milton|Milton]], [[Byron]], [[Walter Scott|Scott]], articles from [[Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine]] and [[Fraser's Magazine]] and The Edinburgh Review, and miscellaneous books of history and geography and biography.<ref name="Fraser 45-48">Fraser, ''The Brontës'', pp. 45–48</ref>

Their reading fed their imaginations, and their creativity soared after their father gave Branwell a set of toy soldiers in June 1826. They gave names to the soldiers, or the "Twelves",<ref>The soldiers appear in ''[[The Twelve and the Genii]]'', a 1962 children's fantasy novel by [[Pauline Clarke]].</ref> and developed their characters. This led to the creation of an imaginary world: the African kingdom of "[[Angria (fictional country)|Angria]]", which was illustrated with maps and watercolour renderings. The children devised plots about the inhabitants of Angria and its capital city, "Glass Town", later called Verreopolis or Verdopolis.<ref name="Barker 154-155">Barker, ''The Brontës'', pp. 154–155</ref>

Their fantastical worlds and kingdoms gradually acquired characteristics from their historical world, drawing from its sovereigns, armies, heroes, outlaws, fugitives, inns, schools, and publishers. The characters and lands created by the children were given newspapers and magazines and chronicles written in tiny books with writing so small that it was difficult to read without a magnifying glass. These creations and writings were an apprenticeship for their later literary talents.<ref name="Fraser 48-58">Fraser, ''The Brontës'', pp. 48–58</ref>

==Juvenilia==
Around 1831, when Anne was eleven, she and Emily broke away from Charlotte and Branwell to create and develop their own fantasy world, "[[Gondal (fictional country)|Gondal]]". Anne and Emily were particularly close, especially after Charlotte left for Roe Head School in January 1831.<ref name="Fraser 52-53">Fraser, ''The Brontës'', pp. 52–53</ref> Charlotte's friend [[Ellen Nussey]] visited Haworth in 1833 and reported that Emily and Anne were "like twins" and "inseparable companions". She described Anne so:
{{Quote|Anne, dear gentle Anne was quite different in appearance from the others, and she was her aunt's favourite. Her hair was a very pretty light brown and fell on her neck in graceful curls. She had lovely violet-blue eyes; fine pencilled eyebrows and a clear almost transparent complexion. She still pursued her studies and especially her sewing, under the surveillance of her aunt.<ref name="Fraser 39">Fraser, ''A Life of Anne Brontë'', p. 39</ref><ref name="Barker 195">Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 195</ref>}}
Anne took lessons from Charlotte after Charlotte had returned from Roe Head. Charlotte returned to Roe Head as a teacher on 29 July 1835, accompanied by Emily as a pupil. Emily's tuition was largely financed by Charlotte's teaching. Emily was unable to adapt to life at school and was physically ill from homesickness within a few months. She was withdrawn from school by October and replaced by Anne.

Anne was 15 and it was her first time away from home. She made few friends at Roe Head. She was quiet and hardworking and determined to stay to acquire the education which she would need to support herself.<ref name="Barker 237-238">Barker, ''The Brontës'', pp. 237–238</ref><ref name="Fraser 84">Fraser, ''The Brontës'', p. 84</ref> She stayed for two years and returned home only during Christmas and summer holidays. She won a good-conduct medal in December 1836. Charlotte's letters almost never mention Anne while Anne was at Roe Head, which might imply that they were not close, but Charlotte was at least concerned about Anne's health. By December 1837 Anne had become seriously ill with [[gastritis]] and embroiled in religious crisis.<ref name="Fraser 113">Fraser, ''The Brontës'', p. 113</ref> A [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] minister was called to see her several times during her illness, suggesting her distress was caused, in part, by conflict with the local Anglican clergy.{{clarify|reason=minister suggested directly? his visits suggest implicitly to us?|date=December 2020}} Charlotte wrote to their father and he brought Anne home.

==Employment at Blake Hall==
[[File:Blake Hall.jpg|thumb|left|Blake Hall, illustration, reproduced from photographs taken at the end of 19th century. It was demolished in 1954.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wessyman137.wordpress.com/2015/04/19/the-mirfield-murders-1847/|title=The Mirfield Murders 1847|date=19 April 2015}}</ref>]]
A year after leaving the school, and aged 19, Anne was seeking a teaching position. She was the daughter of a poor clergyman and needed to earn money. Her father had no private income and the parsonage would revert to the church on his death. Teaching or working as a governess were among few options for a poor and educated woman. In April 1839 Anne started work as a governess for the Ingham family at Blake Hall, near [[Mirfield]].<ref name="Barker 307">Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 307</ref>

The children in her charge were spoiled and disobedient.<ref name="Barker 308">Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 308</ref> Anne had great difficulty controlling them and little success in educating them. She was not allowed to punish them, and when she complained about their behaviour she received no support and was criticised for being incapable. The Inghams were dissatisfied with their children's progress and dismissed Anne.<ref name="Barker 318">Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 318</ref> She returned home in 1839 at Christmas. At home also were Charlotte and Emily, who had left their positions, and Branwell. Anne's time at Blake Hall was so traumatic that she reproduced it in almost perfect{{clarify|date=December 2020}} detail in her novel ''Agnes Grey''.

==William Weightman==
Anne returned to Haworth and met William Weightman (1814–1842), her father's new curate who had started work in the parish in August 1839.<ref name="Alexander & Smith, 531">Alexander & Smith, '' The Oxford Companion to the Brontës'', p. 531</ref> Weightman was 25 and had obtained a two-year licentiate in theology from the [[University of Durham]]. He was welcome at the parsonage. Anne's acquaintance with him parallels her writing a number of poems, which may suggest she fell in love with him<ref name="Barker 341">Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 341</ref><ref name="Barker 407">Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 407</ref>{{clarify|date=December 2020}} although there is disagreement over this possibility.<ref name="Barker 344">Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 344</ref> Little evidence exists beyond a teasing anecdote of Charlotte's to Ellen Nussey in January 1842.{{clarify|date=December 2020}}

In ''Agnes Grey'' Agnes' interest in the curate refreshes her interest in poetry. Outside fiction William Weightman aroused much curiosity. It seems that he was good-looking and engaging, and that his easy humour and kindness towards the sisters made an impression. It is such a character that she portrays in Edward Weston, and that her heroine Agnes Grey finds deeply appealing.<ref name="Gérin 138">Gérin, ''Anne Brontë'', p. 138</ref>{{clarify|reason=Weston not good looking cf. Chap 11 AG|date=December 2020}}

Weightman died of cholera in the same year.<ref name="Barker 403">Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 403</ref> Anne expressed her grief for his death in her poem ''I will not mourn thee, lovely one'', in which she called him "our darling".<ref name="Alexander & Smith, 531"/>

==Governess==
[[File:Emily Brontë cropped.jpg|thumb|Disputed portrait made by [[Branwell Brontë]] about 1833. Sources disagree whether this image is of Emily or Anne.<ref name="Portrait">{{cite web|url=http://www.brontesisters.co.uk/The-Profile-Portrait-Emily-or-Anne.html|title=The Bronte Sisters - A True Likeness? - The Profile Portrait - Emily or Anne|website=www.brontesisters.co.uk}}</ref>]]
From 1840 to 1845 Anne worked at Thorp Green Hall, a comfortable country house near [[York]]. Here she was governess to the children of the Reverend Edmund Robinson and his wife, Lydia.<ref>name="Barker 329">Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 329</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boroughbridgewalks.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/BronteTrail.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512112951/http://www.boroughbridgewalks.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/BronteTrail.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=12 May 2013 |title=The Brontë Trail |publisher=oroughbridgewalks.org.uk |access-date=9 October 2013 }}</ref> The house appeared as Horton Lodge in ''Agnes Grey''. Anne had four pupils: Lydia (15), Elizabeth (13), Mary (12), and Edmund (8).<ref name="Barker 330">Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 330</ref> She initially had problems similar to those at Blake Hall. Anne missed her home and family. In a diary paper in 1841 she wrote that she did not like her situation and wished to leave it. Her quiet and gentle disposition did not help.<ref name="Gérin 135">Gérin, ''Anne Brontë'', p. 135</ref> But Anne was determined and made a success of her position, becoming well-liked by her employers. Her charges, the Robinson girls, became lifelong friends.

Anne spent only five or six weeks a year with her family, during holidays at Christmas and in June. The rest of her time was spent with the Robinsons. She accompanied the Robinsons on annual holidays to [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]]. Between 1840 and 1844 Anne spent around five weeks each summer at the coastal town and loved it.<ref name="Barker 358-359">Barker, ''The Brontës'', pp. 358–359</ref> A number of locations in Scarborough were used for her novels.

Anne and her sisters considered setting up a school while she was still working for the Robinsons. Various locations were considered, including the parsonage, but the project never materialised. Anne came home on the death of her aunt in early November 1842 while her sisters were in Brussels.<ref name="Barker 404">Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 404</ref> Elizabeth Branwell left a £350 legacy (equivalent to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|350|1842|r=-4}}}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} for each of her nieces.<ref name="Barker 409">Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 409</ref>

It was at the Long Plantation at Thorp Green in 1842 that Anne wrote her three-verse poem ''Lines Composed in a Wood on a Windy Day'', which was published in 1846 under the name Acton Bell.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boroughbridgewalks.org.uk/?p=12 |title=The Brontë Trail |publisher=boroughbridgewalks.org.uk |access-date=9 October 2013}}</ref>

In January 1843 Anne returned to Thorp Green and secured a position for Branwell. He was to tutor Edmund, who was growing too old to be in Anne's care. Branwell did not live in the house as Anne did. Anne's vaunted calm appears to have been the result of hard-fought battles, balancing deeply felt emotions with careful thought, a sense of responsibility and resolute determination.<ref name="Gérin 134">Gérin, ''Anne Brontë'', p. 134</ref>{{clarify|reason=what? and so what?|date=December 2020}} All three Brontë sisters worked as governesses or teachers, and all experienced problems controlling their charges, gaining support from their employers, and coping with homesickness, but Anne was the only one who persevered and made a success of her work.<ref name="Oxcomp">{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=Christine|author2=Margaret Smith|title=The Oxford Companion to the Brontës|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2003|isbn=0-19-866218-1|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont0000unse_x4t6}}</ref>

==Back at the parsonage==
[[File:Bronte Parsonage Museum.JPG|thumb|[[Brontë Parsonage Museum]]]]
Anne and Branwell taught at Thorp Green for the next three years. Branwell entered into a secret relationship with his employer's wife, Lydia Robinson.{{clarify|reason=manner of relationship unclear. That Lydia is not employer unclear|date=December 2020}} When Anne and Branwell returned home for the holidays in June 1846 Anne resigned.<ref name="Barker 450">Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 450</ref> Anne gave no reason, but the reason may have been the relationship between her brother and Mrs Robinson.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ellis|first1=Samantha|title=Anne Brontë: the sister who got there first|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/06/anne-bronte-agnes-grey-jane-eyre-charlotte|access-date=9 April 2018|work=The Guardian|date=6 January 2017}}</ref>{{clarify|reason=again relationship unclear|date=December 2020}} Branwell was dismissed when his employer found out about the relationship. Anne continued to exchange letters with Elizabeth and Mary Robinson. They came to visit Anne in December 1848.<ref name="Barker 574">Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 574</ref>

Anne took Emily to visit some of the places which Anne had become fond of. A plan to visit [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] fell through, but they went to [[York]] and saw [[York Minster]].<ref name="Barker 451">Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 451</ref>

==A book of poems==
[[File:Bronte poems2.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Poems by Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell. First edition]]

The Brontës were at home with their father during the summer of 1845. None had any immediate prospect of employment. Charlotte found Emily's poems, which had been shared only with Anne. Charlotte said that they should be published. Anne showed her own poems to Charlotte, and Charlotte "thought that these verses too had a sweet sincere pathos of their own".<ref>

Four months earlier, Fraser's Magazine had published her poem ''The Three Guides''.

==Novels==

===''Agnes Grey''===
{{Main|Agnes Grey}}
By July 1846 a package containing the manuscripts of each sister's first novel was making the rounds of London publishers. Charlotte had written ''[[The Professor (novel)|The Professor]]'', Emily had written ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'', and Anne had written ''Agnes Grey''.

After some rejections ''Wuthering Heights'' and ''Agnes Grey'' were accepted by the publisher [[Thomas Cautley Newby]]. ''The Professor'' was rejected.<ref name="Barker 525">Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 525</ref> It was not long before Charlotte had completed her second novel, ''[[Jane Eyre]]''. ''Jane Eyre'' was accepted immediately by [[Smith, Elder & Co.]]. It was the first published of the sisters' novels, and an immediate and resounding success. Meanwhile, Anne and Emily's novels "lingered in the press". Anne and Emily were obliged to pay fifty pounds to help meet their publishing costs. Their publisher was galvanised by the success of ''Jane Eyre'' and published ''Wuthering Heights'' and ''Agnes Grey'' together in December 1847.<ref name="Barker 539">Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 539</ref> They sold well, but ''Agnes Grey'' was outshone by Emily's more dramatic ''Wuthering Heights''.<ref name="Barker 540">Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 540</ref>

}} Anne's second novel, ''[[The Tenant of Wildfell Hall]]'', was published in the last week of June 1848.<ref name="Barker 557">Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 557</ref>

It is easy to underestimate the extent to which the novel challenged the social and legal structures. In 1913 [[May Sinclair]] said that the slamming of Helen Huntingdon's bedroom door against her husband reverberated throughout Victorian England.<ref>Brontё, Anne. ''The Tenant of Wildfell Hall''. 1848. Introduction. Winifred Gerin. New York: Penguin. 1979.</ref>

In the book Helen has left her husband to protect their son from his influence. She supports herself and her son in hiding by painting. She has violated social conventions and English law. Until the [[Married Women's Property Act 1870]] was passed, a married woman had no legal existence independent from her husband and could not own property nor sue for [[divorce]] nor control the custody of her children. Helen's husband had a right to reclaim her and charge her with kidnapping. By subsisting on her own income she was stealing her husband's property since this income was legally his.<ref name="Oxcomp"/>

Anne stated her intentions in the second edition, published in August 1848. She presented a forceful rebuttal to critics (among them Charlotte) who considered her portrayal of Huntingdon overly graphic and disturbing. Anne "wished to tell the truth". She explained further that

{{quote|When we have to do with vice and vicious characters, I maintain it is better to depict them as they really are than as they would wish to appear. To represent a bad thing in its least offensive light is doubtless the most agreeable course for a writer of fiction to pursue; but is it the most honest, or the safest? Is it better to reveal the snares and pitfalls of life to the young and thoughtless traveller, or to cover them with branches and flowers? O Reader! if there were less of this delicate concealment of facts{{snd}}this whispering 'Peace, peace', when there is no peace,<ref>{{Bibleverse||Jeremiah|6:14|NIV}}</ref> there would be less of sin and misery to the young of both sexes who are left to wring their bitter knowledge from experience.<ref name="Barker 532">Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 532</ref>}}

Anne also castigated reviewers who speculated on the sex of authors and the perceived appropriateness of their writing. She was

{{quote|satisfied that if a book is a good one, it is so whatever the sex of the author may be. All novels are or should be written for both men and women to read, and I am at a loss to conceive how a man should permit himself to write anything that would be really disgraceful to a woman, or why a woman should be censured for writing anything that would be proper and becoming for a man.<ref name="Barker 564">Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 564</ref>}}

In July 1848 Anne and Charlotte went to Charlotte's publisher [[George Murray Smith|George Smith]] in London to dispel the rumour that the "Bell brothers" were one person. Emily refused to go. Anne and Charlotte spent several days with Smith. Many years after Anne's death, he wrote in the [[Cornhill Magazine]] his impressions of her:
{{Quote|a gentle, quiet, rather subdued person, by no means pretty, yet of a pleasing appearance. Her manner was curiously expressive of a wish for protection and encouragement, a kind of constant appeal which invited sympathy.<ref name="Barker 559">Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 559</ref>}}

The increasing popularity of the Bells' works led to renewed interest in ''Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell'', originally published by Aylott and Jones. The remaining print run was bought by Smith and Elder, and reissued under new covers in November 1848. It still sold poorly.

==Family tragedies==
Branwell's persistent drunkenness disguised the decline of his health and he died on 24 September 1848.<ref name="Barker 568">Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 568</ref> His sudden death shocked the family. He was 31. The cause was recorded as chronic bronchitis{{snd}}[[marasmus]],{{clarify|date=December 2020}} but was probably [[tuberculosis]].<ref name="Biography of Anne Brontë">{{cite web

The family suffered from coughs and colds during the winter of 1848, and Emily became very ill. She worsened over two months and rejected medical aid until the morning of 19 December.{{clarify|reason=nonsensical chronology|date=December 2020}} She was very weak and said that "if you will send for a doctor, I will see him now".<ref name="Barker 576">Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 576</ref> But Emily died at about two o'clock that afternoon, aged 30.<ref name="Barker 576"/>

Emily's death deeply affected Anne. Her grief undermined her physical health.<ref>Gaskell EC.

Her symptoms intensified and in early January her father sent for a [[Leeds]] physician. The doctor diagnosed advanced [[tuberculosis|consumption]] with little hope of recovery. Anne met the news with characteristic determination and self-control.<ref name="Ann">

{{quote|I have no horror of death: if I thought it inevitable I think I could quietly resign myself to the prospect&nbsp;... But I wish it would please God to spare me not only for Papa's and Charlotte's sakes but because I long to do some good in the world before I leave it.

But God's will be done.<ref name="Barker 592">Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 592</ref>}}

Unlike Emily, Anne took all the recommended medicines and followed the advice she was given.<ref name="Alexander & Smith, 72">Alexander & Smith, '' The Oxford Companion to the Brontës'', p. 72</ref> That same month{{clarify|date=December 2020}} she wrote her last poem, ''A dreadful darkness closes in'', in which she deals with being terminally ill.<ref name="Alexander & Smith, 170">Alexander & Smith, '' The Oxford Companion to the Brontës'', p. 170</ref> Her health fluctuated for months, but she grew thinner and weaker.

==Death==
[[Image:Annebronte.jpg|thumb|Anne Brontë's grave at Scarborough. The flowering plants have now been replaced by a slab.]]
Anne seemed somewhat better in February.<ref name="Barker 588">Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 588</ref> She decided to visit Scarborough to see if the change of location and the fresh sea air might benefit her.<ref name="Barker 587">Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 587</ref> Charlotte was initially against the journey, fearing that it would be too stressful, but changed her mind after the doctor's approval and Anne's assurance that it was her last hope.<ref name="Barker 592"/>

On 24 May 1849 Anne set off for Scarborough with Charlotte and [[Ellen Nussey]]. They spent a day and night in York en route. Here they escorted Anne in a wheelchair and did some shopping and visited York Minster. It was clear that Anne had little strength left.
[[File:AnnBrontegrave.JPG|left|thumb|Memorial slab lying on the grave of Anne Brontë]]
On Sunday 27 May Anne asked Charlotte whether it would be easier to return home and die instead of remaining in Scarborough. A doctor was consulted the next day and said that death was close. Anne received the news quietly. She expressed her love and concern for Ellen and Charlotte, and whispered for Charlotte to "take courage".<ref name="Barker 594">Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 594</ref> Anne died at about two o'clock in the afternoon on Monday 28 May 1849, aged 29.

Charlotte decided to "lay the flower where it had fallen".<ref name="Biography of Anne Brontë"/> So Anne was buried in Scarborough. The funeral was held on 30 May. Patrick Brontë could not have made the {{convert|70|mi|km|adj=on}} journey if he had wished to. The former schoolmistress at Roe Head, Miss Wooler, was in Scarborough, and she was the only other mourner at Anne's funeral.<ref name="Barker 595">Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 595</ref>{{clarify|reason=Ellen?|date=December 2020}} Anne was buried in [[St Mary's Church, Scarborough|St Mary's]] churchyard, beneath the castle walls and overlooking the bay. Charlotte commissioned a stone to be placed over her grave with the inscription, {{quote|Here lie the remains of Anne Brontë, daughter of the Revd P. Brontë, Incumbent of Haworth, Yorkshire. She died Aged 28 May 28th 1849.}} When Charlotte visited the grave three years later she discovered multiple errors on the headstone and had it refaced. But this was not free of error. For Anne was 29 when she died, not 28 as written.

In 2011 the [[Brontë Parsonage Museum|Brontë Society]] installed a new plaque at Anne Brontë's grave. The original gravestone had become illegible at places and could not be restored. It was left undisturbed while the new plaque was laid horizontally, interpreting the fading words of the original and correcting its error.<ref name="grave-0">{{cite news|work=The Scarborough News |url=http://www.thescarboroughnews.co.uk/news/new-memorial-for-bronte-grave-1-4032457 |title=New memorial for Bronte grave|date=5 December 2011|access-date=16 December 2015}}</ref> In April 2013 the Brontë Society held a dedication and blessing service at the gravesite to mark the installation of the new plaque.<ref name="grave-2">{{cite news|publisher=The Scarborough News |url=http://www.thescarboroughnews.co.uk/news/bronte-memory-will-live-on-in-scarborough-1-5640021 |title=Bronte memory will live on in Scarborough |date=2 May 2013|access-date=16 December 2015}}</ref><ref name="grave-1">{{cite news|publisher=BBC|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-22351887 |title=Anne Brontë's grave error corrected|date= 30 April 2013|access-date=12 May 2013}}</ref>

==Reputation==
After Anne's death Charlotte addressed issues with the first edition of ''Agnes Grey'' for its republication, but she prevented republication of ''The Tenant of Wildfell Hall''.<ref name=" Fraser 387">Fraser, ''The Brontës'', p. 387</ref> In 1850 Charlotte wrote that {{quote|''Wildfell Hall'' it hardly appears to me desirable to preserve. The choice of subject in that work is a mistake, it was too little consonant with the character, tastes and ideas of the gentle, retiring inexperienced writer.<ref name="Barker 654">Barker, ''The Brontës'', p. 654</ref>}} Subsequent critics paid less attention to Anne's work and some dismissed her as "a Brontë without genius".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lane|first1=Margaret|title=The Brontë Story|url=https://archive.org/details/brontstoryrecons0000lane|url-access=registration}}</ref>

But since the mid-20th century her life and works have been given better attention. Biographies by [[Winifred Gérin]] (1959) and Elizabeth Langland (1989) and Edward Chitham (1991), as well as Juliet Barker's group biography, ''The Brontës'' (1994; revised edition 2000), and work by critics such as [[Inga-Stina Ewbank]], Marianne Thormählen, Laura C Berry, Jan B Gordon, Mary Summers, and Juliet McMaster has led to acceptance of Anne Brontë as a major literary figure.<ref name="Ann"/><ref name="Harrison and Stanford 243—245">Harrison and Stanford, ''Anne Brontë — Her Life and Work'', стр. 243—245</ref> Sally McDonald of the Brontë Society said in 2013 that in some ways Anne "is now viewed as the most radical of the sisters, writing about tough subjects such as women's need to maintain independence and how alcoholism can tear a family apart."<ref name="grave-1"/> In 2016 [[Lucy Mangan]] championed Anne Brontë in the BBC's ''Being the Brontës'', declaring that "her time has come".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/23/being-the-brontes-bbc-lucy-mangan-anne-bronte|title=The forgotten genius: why Anne wins the battle of the Brontës|first=Lucy|last=Mangan|date=23 March 2016|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>
