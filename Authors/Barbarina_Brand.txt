Barbarina Ogle was born in 1768. She was the third daughter of Admiral [[Sir Chaloner Ogle, 1st Baronet]] (died 1816), and Hester Thomas (daughter of [[John Thomas (bishop of Winchester)|John Thomas]], [[Bishop of Winchester]]). Her brother was Admiral [[Sir Charles Ogle, 2nd Baronet]]. Her sister, Sophia, was married to General [[Sir Charles Asgill, 2nd Baronet]].

Educated at home, she became "one of the most accomplished women of her time":<ref>Cooper, Thompson. "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3249 Brand , Barbarina, Lady Dacre (1768–1854)]." Rev. Rebecca Mills. ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''. Ed. H. C. G. Matthew and Brian Harrison. Oxford: OUP, 2004. 6 Jan. 2007.</ref>

==Career==
In 1789, she married Valentine Henry Wilmot, of Farnborough, Hampshire, an officer in the guards, though they later separated. The couple had one daughter, [[Arabella Sullivan|Arabella Jane (Wilmont) Sullivan]] (1796–1839). After Wilmot's death in 1819, she married [[Thomas Brand, 20th Baron Dacre]] (1774–1851), later that same year. He died without issue.{{sfn|Urban|1854|p=296}}

Lady Dacre was one of the most accomplished and intellectual women of her time. In 1821, her poetical works were printed, but not published, in two volumes [[octavo]], under the title of ''Dramas, Translations, and Occasional Poems. By Barbarina Lady Dacre''. Some of these were dated in the 18th century. They included four dramas, the first of which, ''Gonzalvo of Cordova'', was written in 1810. In the character of the great captain, the author followed the novel of [[Jean-Pierre Claris de Florian]]. The next, ''Pedrarias, a tragic drama'', was written in May 1811; and its story was derived from ''Les Incas'' of [[Jean-François Marmontel]]. Her third dramatic work was ''Ina, a tragedy in five acts'', the plot of which was laid in [[Saxon]] times in England. It was produced at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]] on the 22 April 1815, under the management of [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]], to whose second wife, the daughter of Dr. Ogle, Dean of Winchester, the author was related. It was not sufficiently successful to induce its repetition, for in the Times of the 24 April 1815, was printer: "The second representation of the new tragedy called ''Ina'' is postponed till further notice, at the express desire of the authoress." It was printed in 1815 as produced on the stage; but in Lady Dacre's collected works, she restored "the original catastrophe, and some other parts which had been cut out." A fourth drama bore the title of ''Xarifa''. It was remarked in the ''Quarterly Review'', No. xcvii. that her, "Dramas, both tragic and comic, have been much and greatly admired." Lady Dacre's book contained also several translations of the [[sonnet]]s of [[Petrarch]], some of which seemed to have been privately printed at an earlier date. In 1823, when [[Ugo Foscolo]] produced his ''Essays on Petrarch'', he dedicated the volume to Lady Dacre. The last 45 pages of Foscolo's book were occupied by Lady Dacre's translations from Petrarch.{{sfn|Urban|1854|p=297}}

In addition to her other accomplishments, Lady Dacre was an excellent amateur artist, and excelled in modelling animals, particularly the horse.{{sfn|Urban|1854|p=297}}

==Later life and death==
She edited in 1831 ''Recollections of a Chaperon'', and in 1838, ''Tales of the Peerage and Peasantry'', both written by her only daughter Arabella Sullivan (the author of ''Ellen Wareham''). Arabella died in the year 1849, leaving by the Rev. Frederick Sullivan, Vicar of [[Kimpton, Hertfordshire]], five children.{{sfn|Urban|1854|p=297}}

Her final years were marked by the loss of her hearing. She died on 17 May 1854.<ref name= "Grey1908">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/afamilychronicl00greygoog|title=A Family Chronicle|last=Grey|first=Lady Barbarina Charlotte Sullivan|date=1908-01-01|publisher=John Murray|editor-last=Lyster|editor-first=Gertrude|edition=Public domain|language=en}}</ref>
