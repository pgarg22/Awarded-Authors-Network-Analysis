'''Leslie Scalapino''' (July 25, 1944 &ndash; May 28, 2010) was an [[American poet]], experimental prose writer, [[playwright]], [[essayist]], and [[Editing|editor]], sometimes grouped in with the [[Language poets]], though she felt closely tied to the [[Beat poets]].<ref name="hejinian">{{cite web |url=http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/21547 |title= Leslie Scalapino Remembered |last1=Hejinian |first1=Lyn |date= |work= Poet.org |publisher= [[Academy of American Poets]] |accessdate= December 26, 2010}} Writes Hejinian:

{{blockquote|She had close ties to writers of the Beat movement, especially with those whose serious study of Buddhism influenced their writing and their vision of an ethical world. She also had numerous ties to the Language writers. But these were largely ties of community and friendship. In her writing, Leslie Scalapino's voice and vision were unprecedented, a product of her unique and rigorous intelligence and compassion. She belonged to no school; her engagement with continual conceptual rebellion would have prohibited that.}}</ref>  A longtime resident of [[California]]'s [[Bay Area]], she earned an M.A. in English from the [[University of California at Berkeley]]. One of Scalapino's most critically well-received works is '''way''' (North Point Press, 1988), a long poem which won the [[Poetry Center Award]], the [[Lawrence Lipton Prize]], and the [[American Book Award]].

==Life and work==
Scalapino was born in [[Santa Barbara, California]] and raised in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]. She traveled throughout her youth and adulthood to Asia, Africa and Europe and her writing was intensely influenced by these experiences.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://smallpresstraffic.org/1209 |title=the Leslie Scalapino Memorial Lecture in Innovative Poetics with Jalal Toufic SPT |publisher=Smallpresstraffic.org |date=2012-05-08 |accessdate=2012-06-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808221037/http://smallpresstraffic.org/1209 |archive-date=2012-08-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>Some of the other places Scalapino traveled included Tibet, Bhutan, Japan, India, Mongolia, Yemen, Libya</ref> In childhood Scalapino traveled with her father [[Robert A.

{{quote box|width=30em|salign=right|quote= A solitary, an original. What other way could there be for someone with a mind so electric, independent and restless except out into the space-time conundrum? Because she is thoroughly modern, every moment of experience is interrupted and unstable, accompanied by introspection and sidelong glimpses at the social. The poet here is a horrified witness, a perpetual child, a sexually alert female who keeps looking back to believe what she has seen.|source = —[[Fanny Howe]]<ref>a blurb on Scalapino's ''It's go in horizontal, Selected Poems 1974-2006''</ref>}}
