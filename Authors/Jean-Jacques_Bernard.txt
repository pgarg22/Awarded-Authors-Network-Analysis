'''Jean-Jacques Bernard''' (30 July 1888 – 14 September 1972) was a French playwright and the chief representative of what became known as ''l’école du silence'' or, as some critics called it, the ''art of the unexpressed'', in which the dialogue does not express the characters’ real attitudes. In ''Martine'' (1922), perhaps the best example of his work, emotions are implied in gestures, facial expressions, fragments of speech and silence. He was active from 1912 to 1939.

Bernard was born in [[Enghien-les-Bains]], [[Val-d'Oise]], the son of the dramatist [[Tristan Bernard]].  As a Jew, he was interned for a period of months starting in December 1941 in [[Compiègne]], at a camp where 50,000 Jews were deported to concentration camps.<ref>[http://holocaust-education.net/explore.asp?langid=1&submenu=201&id=18 Compiègne Camp] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304073036/http://holocaust-education.net/explore.asp?langid=1&submenu=201&id=18 |date=2016-03-04 }}, Learning about the Holocaust through Art.

Unlike the camps in the South of France, French-born and foreign-born Jews found themselves thrust together in Compiègne. The French Jewish author Jean-Jacques Bernard describes this encounter..."</ref><ref>[[Omer Bartov|Bartov, Omer]]; and Mack, Phyllis.

"Jean-Jacques Bernard, for example, a well-known native French Jewish writer (and son of the even better known French dramatist Tristan Bernard) who had been interned in Compiegne from December 1941 to February 1942, became a public proponent of radical assimilation."</ref>  He died in Paris, aged 84.
