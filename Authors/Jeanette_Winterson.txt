==Career==
After she moved to London, she wrote her first novel, ''[[Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit]],'' which won the 1985 [[Whitbread Prize]] for a First Novel.

Winterson's 2012 novella ''The Daylight Gate'', based on the [[Pendle witches|1612 Pendle Witch Trials]], appeared on their 400th anniversary. Its main character, Alice Nutter, is based on the [[Alice Nutter (witch)|real-life woman of the same name]]. ''[[The Guardian]]'''s [[Sarah Hall (writer)|Sarah Hall]] describes the work: <blockquote>"the narrative voice is irrefutable; this is old-fashioned storytelling, with a sermonic tone that commands and terrifies. It's also like courtroom reportage, sworn witness testimony. The sentences are short, truthful – and dreadful.... Absolutism is Winterson's forte, and it's the perfect mode to verify supernatural events when they occur. You're not asked to believe in magic. Magic exists. A severed head talks. A man is transmogrified into a hare. The story is stretched as tight as a rack, so the reader's disbelief is ruptured rather than suspended. And if doubt remains, the text's sensuality persuades."<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/16/daylight-gate-jeanette-winterson-review |title=The Daylight Gate by Jeanette Winterson – review |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=16 August 2013 |access-date=9 October 2013 |archive-date=4 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140604235145/http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/16/daylight-gate-jeanette-winterson-review |url-status=live }}</ref></blockquote>
