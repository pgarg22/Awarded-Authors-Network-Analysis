==Career==
[[File:Paris Bouffes du Nord 01.JPG|thumb|Bouffes du Nord theatre, Paris]]
Brook directed ''[[Doctor Faustus (play)|Dr Faustus]]'', his first production, in 1943 at the Torch Theatre in London, followed at the Chanticleer Theatre in 1945 with a revival of ''[[The Infernal Machine (play)|The Infernal Machine]]''. In 1947, he went to [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] as assistant director on ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' and ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]''. From 1947 to 1950, he was Director of Productions at the [[Royal Opera House]] in London. His work there included a highly controversial staging of [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'' with sets by [[Salvador Dalí]], and an effective re-staging of [[Puccini]]'s ''[[La bohème]]'' using sets dating from 1899. A proliferation of stage and screen work as producer and director followed. ''[[Dark of the Moon (play)|Dark of the Moon]]'' by [[Howard Richardson (playwright)|Howard Richardson]] (1948–49), at the [[Ambassadors Theatre (London)|Ambassadors Theatre]], London, was an early, much admired production.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In 1970, with [[Micheline Rozan]], Brook founded the [[International Centre for Theatre Research]], a multinational company of actors, dancers, musicians and others, which travelled widely in the Middle East and Africa in the early 1970s. It has been based in Paris at the [[Théâtre des Bouffes du Nord|Bouffes du Nord theatre]] since 1974.<ref>Chambers, Colin ''The Continuum Companion To Twentieth Century Theatre'' (Continuum, 2002, {{ISBN|0-8264-4959-X}}) p. 384</ref> He announced in 2008 that he would resign as artistic director of Bouffes du Nord, beginning that year a three-year handover to [[Olivier Mantei]] and Olivier Poubelle.<ref>{{cite news |last=Chrisafis |first=Angelique |title=Interview: Peter Brook says a long goodbye to his Paris theatre |work=The Guardian |date=17 December 2008 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/dec/17/peter-brook-bouffes-nord-paris |access-date=29 December 2008}}</ref>

===Influences===
Brook has been influenced by the work of [[Antonin Artaud]] and his ideas for his [[Theatre of Cruelty]].

<blockquote>In England, Peter Brook and Charles Marowitz undertook The Theatre of Cruelty Season (1964) at the Royal Shakespeare Company, aiming to explore ways in which Artaud's ideas could be used to find new forms of expression and retrain the performer. The result was a showing of 'works in progress' made up of improvisations and sketches, one of which was the premier of Artaud's ''[[Jet of Blood|The Spurt of Blood]]''.
:– [[Lee Jamieson]], ''Antonin Artaud: From Theory to Practice'', Greenwich Exchange, 2007</blockquote>

His greatest influence, however, was [[Joan Littlewood]]. Brook described her as "the most galvanising director in mid-20th century Britain". Brook's work is also inspired by the theories of experimental theatre of [[Jerzy Grotowski]],<ref name="Empty">{{cite book|title=The Empty Space|url=https://archive.org/details/emptyspace0000broo|url-access=registration|last=Brook|first= Peter|author-link= Peter Brook|year=1968|publisher=[New York] Discus Books}}</ref> [[Bertolt Brecht]], Chris Covics and [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]] and by the works of [[George Gurdjieff|G.

===Collaborators===
Brook has collaborated with a range of directors, writers and actors during his career, notable examples include actors [[Paul Scofield]] and [[Glenda Jackson]]; designers [[Georges Wakhévitch]] and [[Sally Jacobs]], and writers [[Ted Hughes]] and [[William Golding]]. Brook first encountered Wakhévitch in London when he saw the production of [[Jean Cocteau]]'s ballet ''Le Jeune Homme et la Mort'' which Wakhévitch designed. Brook declared that he "was convinced that this was the designer for whom I had been waiting".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brook|first1=Peter|title=Threads of Time: A Memoir|year=1999|isbn=0-413-73300-9}}, 53</ref>

===''The Mahabharata''===
{{main|The Mahabharata (play)}}
In the mid-1970s,<ref name='New York Times'>{{cite news|first=Joe|last=Morgenstern|title=Jean-Claude Pierre; the Mahabharata, the great history of mankind – interview about the stage adaptation|date=17 April 1988|work=The New York Times|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE1DC143AF934A25757C0A96E948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2|access-date=6 October 2007}}</ref> Brook, with writer [[Jean-Claude Carrière]], began work on adapting the Indian epic poem the ''[[Mahābhārata]]'' into a stage play which was first performed in 1985<ref>{{cite news|first=Jean-Claude|last=Carriere|title=Jean-Claude Carriere; the Mahabharata, the great history of mankind – interview about the stage adaptation|date=September 1989|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1310/is_1989_Sept/ai_8067489|work=UNESCO Courier|access-date=6 October 2007}}</ref> and then later into a televised mini series.

In a long article in 1985, ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted "overwhelming critical acclaim", and that the play "did nothing less than attempt to transform Hindu myth into universalized art, accessible to any culture".<ref>{{Cite news |title=Peter Brook transforms an Indian epic for the stage|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/25/arts/peter-brook-transforms-an-indian-epic-for-the-stage.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 1985-08-25|access-date = 2015-12-16|issn = 0362-4331|author=Margaret Croyden}}</ref> However, many postcololonial scholars have challenged the claim to universalism, accusing the play of [[orientalism]]. For instance, Gautam Dasgupta writes that, "Brook's ''Mahabharata'' falls short of the essential Indianness of the epic by staging predominantly its major incidents and failing to adequately emphasize its coterminous philosophical precepts."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dasgupta |first1=Gautam |editor1-last=Marranca |editor1-first=Bonnie |editor2-last=Gautam |editor2-first=Dasgupta |title=Interculturalism and Performance: Writings from PAJ |date=1991 |publisher=PAJ Publications |location=New York |page=81 |chapter="The Mahabharata: Peter Brook's Orientalism"}}</ref>

In 2015, Brook returned to the world of ''The Mahabharata'' with a new [[Young Vic]] production, ''[[Battlefield (Peter Brook)|Battlefield]]'' in collaboration with Jean-Claude Carrière and Marie-Hélène Estienne.

===''Tierno Bokar''===
In 2005, Brook directed ''Tierno Bokar'', based on the life of the [[Mali Empire|Malian]] [[sufi]] of [[Tierno Bokar|the same name]].<ref name=":1" /> The play was adapted for the stage by Marie-Hélène Estienne from a book by [[Amadou Hampate Ba]] (translated into English as ''[[A Spirit of Tolerance: The Inspiring Life of Tierno Bokar]]''). The book and play detail Bokar's life and message of [[religious tolerance]]. [[Columbia University]] produced 44 related events, lectures, and workshops that were attended by over 3,200 people throughout the run of ''Tierno Bokar''. Panel discussions focused on topics of [[religious tolerance]] and [[Muslim]] tradition in West Africa.<ref>[http://www.tiernobokar.columbia.edu Columbia University, "Record of Events"], tiernobokar.columbia.edu; accessed 19 June 2015.</ref>

==Personal life==
In 1951, Brook married actress [[Natasha Parry]]. They had two children: [[Irina Brook|Irina]], an actress and director, and [[Simon Brook (director)|Simon]], a director. Parry died of a [[stroke]] in July 2015, aged 84.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/jul/26/natasha-parry |title=Natasha Parry obituary |work=The Guardian |date=26 July 2015}}</ref>
