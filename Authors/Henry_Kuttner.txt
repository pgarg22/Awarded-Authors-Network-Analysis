'''Henry Kuttner''' (April 7, 1915 – February 3, 1958) was an American author of science fiction, [[fantasy fiction|fantasy]] and [[horror fiction|horror]].

==Early life==
Henry Kuttner was born in Los Angeles, California in 1915. {{Proper name|Naphtaly}} Kuttner (1829–1903) and Amelia Bush (c. 1834–1911), the parents of his father, the bookseller Henry Kuttner (1863–1920), had come from [[Leszno]] in [[Prussia]] and lived in San Francisco since 1859; the parents of his mother, Annie Levy (1875–1954), were from Great Britain. Henry Kuttner's great-grandfather was the scholar [[Josua Heschel Kuttner]]. Kuttner grew up in relative poverty following the death of his father. As a young man he worked in his spare time for the literary agency of his uncle,<ref>According to [[Robert Bloch]] in his autobiography ''Once Around The Bloch'' BY: Tor Books, (1995), p. 95.</ref> [[Laurence D'Orsay]] (in fact his first cousin per marriage), in Los Angeles before selling his first story, "The Graveyard Rats", to ''[[Weird Tales]]'' in early 1936. It was while working for the d'Orsay agency that Kuttner picked [[Leigh Brackett]]'s early manuscripts off the slush pile; it was under his tutelage that she sold her first story (to [[John W. Campbell]] at [[Astounding Stories]]).<ref>Leigh Brackett "My Friend, Henry Kuttner." ''Etchings and Odysseys'' 4 (1984), p. 10.</ref>

==Kuttner and Moore==
Kuttner was known for his literary prose and worked in close collaboration with his wife, [[C. L. Moore]]. They met through their association with the "[[Lovecraft Circle]]", a group of writers and fans who corresponded with [[H. P. Lovecraft]].<ref>DeCamp, L. Sprague. ''Warlocks and Warriors'', p. 167 (NY, Berkley 1971).</ref> Their work together spanned the 1940s and 1950s and most of the work was credited to pseudonyms, mainly [[Lewis Padgett]] and Lawrence O'Donnell.

[[L. Sprague de Camp]], who knew Kuttner and Moore well, has stated that their collaboration was so seamless that, after a story was completed, it was often impossible for either Kuttner or Moore to recall who had written what. According to de Camp, it was typical for either partner to break off from a story in mid-paragraph or even mid-sentence, with the latest page of the manuscript still in the typewriter. The other spouse would routinely continue the story where the first had left off. They alternated in this manner as many times as necessary until the story was finished.

Among Kuttner's most popular work were the Gallegher stories, published under the Padgett name, about a man who invented high-tech solutions to client problems (assisted by his insufferably egomaniacal robot) when he was drunk, only to be completely unable to remember exactly what he had built or why after sobering up. These stories were later collected in ''[[Robots Have No Tails]]''. In her introduction to the 1973 Lancer Books edition, Moore stated that Kuttner wrote all the Gallegher stories himself.<ref>http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?767085 Retrieved February 14, 2017</ref>

==Influence==
[[Marion Zimmer Bradley]] is among many authors who have cited Kuttner as an influence. Her novel ''The Bloody Sun'' is dedicated to him. [[Roger Zelazny]] has talked about the influence of ''The Dark World'' on his [[Amber (fictional realm)|Amber]] series.

Kuttner's friend [[Richard Matheson]] dedicated his 1954 novel ''[[I Am Legend (novel)|I Am Legend]]'' to Kuttner, with thanks for his help and encouragement. [[Ray Bradbury]] has said that Kuttner actually wrote the last 300 words of Bradbury's first horror story, "The Candle" (''Weird Tales'', November 1942). Bradbury has referred to Kuttner as a neglected master and a "pomegranate writer: popping with seeds—full of ideas".<ref>Ray Bradbury, "Introduction: Henry Kuttner: A Neglected Master" in ''The Best of Henry Kuttner'', Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1975, pp. vii–xii. "Pomegranate" is on p. vii; Shawn Ramsey, "Henry Kuttner's Cthulhu Mythos Fiction: An Overview", in ''The Horror of It All'', Robert M. Price, ed.</ref>

[[William S. Burroughs]]'s novel ''[[The Ticket That Exploded]]'' contains direct quotes from Kuttner regarding the "Happy Cloak" parasitic pleasure monster from the Venusian seas.

[[Mary Elizabeth Counselman]] believed that Kuttner's habit of writing under widely varied pseudonyms deprived him of the fame that should have been his. "I have often wondered why Kuttner chose to hide his talents behind so many false faces for no editorial reason... Admittedly, the fun is in pretending to be someone else. But Kuttner cheated himself of much fame that he richly deserved by hiding his light under a bushel of pen names that many fans did not know were his. [[Seabury Quinn]] and I both chided him about this."<ref>"Mary Elizabeth Counselman, "Hank and ''Weird Tales''". ''Etchings and Odysseys'' 4 (1984), p. 38</ref>

According to [[J. Vernon Shea]], August Derleth "kept promising to publish Hank's and Catherine's books under the [[Arkham House]] imprint, but kept postponing them."<ref>J. Vernon Shea, "Henry Kuttner: A Memoir", ''Etchings and Odysseys'' 4 (1984), p. 9</ref>

==The Cthulhu Mythos==
A friend of Lovecraft's as well as of [[Clark Ashton Smith]], Kuttner contributed several stories to the [[Cthulhu Mythos]] genre invented by those authors (among others). Among these were "The Secret of Kralitz" (Weird Tales, October 1936), "The Eater of Souls" (''Weird Tales'', January 1937), "The Salem Horror" (''Weird Tales'', May 1937), "The Invaders" (''[[Strange Stories]]'', February 1939) and "The Hunt" (''Strange Stories'', June 1939).<ref>His Mythos related stories were published in ''The Book of Iod'' in 1995, edited by Robert M. Price.</ref>

Kuttner added a few lesser-known deities to the Mythos, including [[Henry Kuttner deities#Iod|Iod]] ("The Secret of Kralitz"), [[Henry Kuttner deities#Vorvadoss|Vorvadoss]] ("The Eater of Souls"), and [[Henry Kuttner deities#Nyogtha|Nyogtha]] ("The Salem Horror"). Critic Shawn Ramsey suggests that Abigail Prinn, the villain of "The Salem Horror", might have been intended by Kuttner to be a descendant of [[Cthulhu Mythos biographies#Prinn, Ludvig|Ludvig Prinn]], author of ''[[De Vermis Mysteriis]]''—a book that appears in Kuttner's "The Invaders".<ref>Ramsey, p. 122.</ref>

''Etchings and Odysseys'' No 4 (1984), edited by Eric A. Carlson, John J. Koblas and R. Alain Everts, was a special Kuttner tribute issue featuring three reprinted tales by Kuttner - "It Walks By Night", "The Frog" and "The Invaders," together with various essays on Kuttner, and an interview with his wife and fellow writer [[C.L. Moore]].

''[[Crypt of Cthulhu]]'' 5, No 7 (whole number 41) (Lammas 1986), edited by [[Robert M. Price]], was a special Henry Kuttner issue collecting eight Cthulhu Mythos stories by Kuttner. (It did not include "Spawn of Dagon" or "The Invaders").

''[[The Book of Iod]]: Ten Tales of the Mythos'' is a collection of Kuttner's Cthulhu Mythos stories edited by Robert M. Price (Chaosium, 1995). (It also contains three additional tales concerning 'Iod's dread tome' by [[Robert Bloch]], [[Lin Carter]] and [[Robert M. Price]]). The Kuttner stories included are: "The Secret of Kralitz", "The Eater of Souls", "The Salem Horror", "The Jest of Droom-Avesta", "Spawn of Dagon", "The Invaders", "The Frog", "Hydra", "Bells of Horror" and "The Hunt" - thus, all the Mythos stories which had appeared in the special Kuttner issue of ''Crypt of Cthulhu'', plus "Spawn of Dagon" and "The Invaders". The story "The Black Kiss" (printed here, as often elsewhere, under the joint byline of Kuttner and Robert Bloch), was in fact written entirely by Bloch; Bloch co-credited Kuttner on the tale due to using the character Michael Leigh from "The Salem Horror".<ref>Robert M. Price, "Editorial Shards", ''Crypt of Cthulhu'' 41 (Lammas 1986), p. 2.</ref> "Beneath the Tombstone" by [[Robert M. Price]] and "Dead of Night" by [[Lin Carter]] round out the volume. Price points out in his introduction to the volume that "Henry Kuttner's own private corner of the Cthulhu Mythos was, then, apparently derived in about equal measure from Lovecraft, Bloch, [[Zoroastrianism]], and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]."<ref>"The Khut-N'ha Mythos" by Robert M. Price (ed) in Henry Kuttner, ''The Book of Iod'' (Chaosium, 1995), vi.</ref>

==Later life==
Henry Kuttner spent the middle 1950s getting his master's degree before dying of a heart attack in Los Angeles in 1958.
