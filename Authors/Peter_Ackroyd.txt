'''Peter Ackroyd''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|sep=,|size=100|CBE|FRSL}} (born 5 October 1949) is an English biographer, novelist and critic with a particular interest in the history and culture of London. For his novels about English history and culture and his biographies of, among others, [[William Blake]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Charles Chaplin]] and [[Sir Thomas More]], he won the [[Somerset Maugham Award]] and two [[Whitbread Awards]]. He is noted for the volume of work he has produced, the range of styles therein, his skill at assuming different voices, and the depth of his research.

He was elected a fellow of the [[Royal Society of Literature]] in 1984 and appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in 2003.

==Early life and education==
Ackroyd was born in [[London]] and raised on a [[council estate]] in [[East Acton]], in what he has described as a "strict" [[Roman Catholic]] household by his mother and grandmother, after his father disappeared from the family home.<ref name="BBC 2012" /> He first knew that he was gay when he was seven.<ref name="The Independent 2009">{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/peter-ackroyd-retire-only-if-my-arms-are-chopped-off-first-1742766.html |title=Peter Ackroyd: 'Retire? Only if my arms are chopped off first' - Profiles - People |work=The Independent |date=12 July 2009 |access-date=4 April 2013}}</ref> He was educated at [[St Benedict's School, Ealing|St. Benedict's]], [[Ealing]], and at [[Clare College, Cambridge]], from which he graduated with a [[double first]] in English literature.<ref name="theguardian.com">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jul/03/biography.fiction |title=London calling |first=John |last=O'Mahony |date=2 July 2004 |website=The Guardian}}</ref> In 1972, he was a [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation|Mellon fellow]] at [[Yale University]].

==Work==
The result of his Yale fellowship was ''Notes for a New Culture'', written when Ackroyd was only 22 and eventually published in 1976. The title, an echo of [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''Notes Towards the Definition of Culture'' (1948), was an early indication of Ackroyd's penchant for exploring and re-examining the works of other London-based writers. He worked at ''[[The Spectator (1828)|The Spectator]]'' magazine between 1973 and 1977 as literary editor<ref name="independent.co.uk">{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/peter-ackroyd-rioting-has-been-a-london-tradition-for-centuries-2341673.html |title=Peter Ackroyd: 'Rioting has been a London tradition for centuries' |date=22 August 2011 |work=The Independent}}</ref> and became joint managing editor in 1978, a position he held until 1982.<ref name="theguardian.com"/> He worked as chief book reviewer for ''[[The Times]]'' and was a frequent broadcaster on radio. Since 1984 he has been a [[Royal Society of Literature|fellow of the Royal Society of Literature]].<ref name="independent.co.uk"/>

His literary career began with poetry; his work in that field includes such works as ''London Lickpenny'' (1973) and ''The Diversions of Purley'' (1987). In 1982 he published ''The Great Fire of London'', his first novel, which is a reworking of [[Charles Dickens]]' novel ''[[Little Dorrit]]''. The novel set the stage for the long sequence of novels Ackroyd has produced since, all of which deal in some way with the complex interaction of time and space and what Ackroyd calls "the spirit of place". However, this transition to being a novelist was unexpected. In an interview with Patrick McGrath in 1989, Ackroyd said:

<blockquote>I enjoy it, I suppose, but I never thought I'd be a novelist. I never wanted to be a novelist. I can't bear fiction. I hate it. It's so untidy. When I was a young man I wanted to be a poet, then I wrote a critical book, and I don't think I even read a novel till I was about 26 or 27.<ref>McGrath, Patrick. [http://bombsite.com/issues/26/articles/1168 "Peter Ackroyd Interview"] ''[[BOMB Magazine]]'' Winter, 1989. Retrieved 19 January 2011.</ref></blockquote>

In his novels he often contrasts historical settings with present-day segments (e.g. ''The Great Fire of London'', ''Hawksmoor'', ''The House of Doctor Dee'').{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Many of Ackroyd's novels are set in London and deal with the ever-changing, but at the same time stubbornly consistent nature of the city. Often this theme is explored through the city's artists, especially its writers: [[Oscar Wilde]] in ''The Last Testament of Oscar Wilde'' (1983), a fake autobiography of Wilde; [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]], Sir [[Christopher Wren]] and Sir [[John Vanbrugh]] in ''Hawksmoor'' (1985); [[Thomas Chatterton]] and [[George Meredith]] in ''Chatterton'' (1987); [[John Dee]] in ''The House of Dr Dee'' (1993); [[Dan Leno]], [[Karl Marx]], [[George Gissing]] and [[Thomas De Quincey]] in ''Dan Leno and the Limehouse Golem'' (1994); [[John Milton]] in ''Milton in America'' (1996); [[Charles Lamb]] in ''The Lambs of London''.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

[[Hawksmoor (novel)|''Hawksmoor'']], winner of both the [[Whitbread Novel Award]]<ref name="independent.co.uk"/> and the [[Guardian Fiction Prize]], was inspired by [[Iain Sinclair]]'s poem "Lud Heat" (1975), which speculated on a mystical power from the positioning of the six churches Nicholas Hawksmoor built. The novel gives Hawksmoor a Satanical motive for the siting of his buildings, and creates a modern namesake, a policeman investigating a series of murders. ''Chatterton'' (1987), a similarly layered novel explores plagiarism and forgery and was shortlisted for the [[Booker Prize]]. ''[[London: The Biography]]'' is an extensive and thorough discussion of London through the ages. In 1994 he was interviewed about the [[London Psychogeographical Association]] in an article for ''[[The Observer]]'', in which he remarked:<blockquote>I truly believe that there are certain people to whom or through whom the territory, the place, the past speaks. ... Just as it seems possible to me that a street or dwelling can materially affect the character and behaviour of the people who dwell in them, is it not also possible that within this city (London) and within its culture are patterns of sensibility or patterns of response which have persisted from the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries and perhaps even beyond?<ref>'Cultists' Go Round in Circles', Barry Hugill, ''The Observer'', Sunday 28 August 1994.</ref></blockquote>

In the sequence ''London: The Biography'' (2000), ''Albion: The Origins of the English Imagination'' (2002), and ''Thames: Sacred River'' (2007), Ackroyd has produced works of what he considers historical [[sociology]]. These books trace themes in London and English culture from the ancient past to the present, drawing again on his favoured notion of almost spiritual lines of connection rooted in place and stretching across time.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

His fascination with London literary and artistic figures is also displayed in the sequence of biographies he has produced of [[Ezra Pound]] (1980), [[T. S. Eliot]] (1984), [[Charles Dickens]] (1990), [[William Blake]] (1995), [[Thomas More]] (1998), [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] (2004), [[William Shakespeare]] (2005), and [[J. M. W. Turner]]. The city itself stands astride all these works, as it does in the fiction. Ackroyd was forced to think of new methods of biography writing in ''T. S. Eliot'' when he was told he couldn't quote extensively from Eliot's poetry and unpublished letters.<ref>{{cite web|author=British Council|url=http://www.contemporarywriters.com/authors/?p=auth148|title=Peter Ackroyd &#124; British Council Literature|publisher=Contemporarywriters.com|access-date=4 April 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805075729/http://www.contemporarywriters.com/authors/?p=auth148|archive-date=5 August 2011}}</ref>

From 2003 to 2005, Ackroyd wrote a six-book non-fiction series (''Voyages Through Time''), intended for readers as young as eight, his first work for children. The critically acclaimed series—described as "Not just sound-bite snacks for short attention spans, but unfolding feasts that leave you with a sense of wonder" by ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' is an extensive narrative of key periods in world history.<ref>{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Nicolette|date=28 September 2003|title=Voyages Through Time by Peter Ackroyd|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/voyages-through-time-by-peter-ackroyd-zlvxq503q9c|work=The Sunday Times|location=London}}</ref>

In a 2012 interview with Matthew Stadlen of the BBC, when asked the question, "Who do you think is the person who has made the biggest impact upon the life of this country ever?", Ackroyd said, "I think William Blake is the most powerful and most significant philosopher or thinker in the course of English history." In the same interview, when asked what fascinates him about London, he said he admired "its power, its majesty, its darkness, its shadows."<ref name="bbc">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-17790481|title=Five minutes with Peter Ackroyd|publisher=Bbc.co.uk|author=Stadlen, Matthew|date=21 April 2012|access-date=4 April 2013}}</ref> When asked what he did outside of writing, he said, "I drink, that's about it."<ref name="bbc"/>

==Personal life==
Ackroyd had a long-term relationship with Brian Kuhn, an American dancer he met while at Yale. After a nervous breakdown in the late 1980s, Ackroyd moved to [[Devon]] with Kuhn. However, Kuhn was then diagnosed with [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]], and died in 1994, after which Ackroyd moved back to London. In 1999, he suffered a heart attack and was placed in a medically induced coma for a week.<ref name="The Independent 2009" /><ref>{{cite web | last=Anthony | first=Andrew | title=The Observer Profile: Peter Ackroyd | website=The Guardian | date=3 September 2005 | url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/sep/04/biography.peterackroyd}}</ref>

In a 2004 interview, Ackroyd said that he had not been in a relationship since Kuhn's death and was "very happy being [[Celibacy|celibate]]."<ref name="theguardian.com"/>
