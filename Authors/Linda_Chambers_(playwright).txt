'''Linda Chambers''' is an American [[playwright]], [[screenwriter]], [[actress]] and college instructor living and working in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]].

==Career==
Linda Chambers first began serious writing after becoming involved with [[Corner Theatre ETC]], an [[experimental theatre]] located in Baltimore. Although her first work at Corner was as an actress - she appeared in the lead role of  [[Steve Yeager (filmmaker)|Steve Yeager]]'s acclaimed 1976 production of ''Marguerite,'' written by C. Richard Gillespie - she became increasing drawn into a circle of playwrights whose work was being produced there. In 1981, Chambers moved to [[New York City]] with the intention of pursuing a professional theatrical career. In 1982, an evening of three one-act plays written by Chambers was presented off-Broadway at the Cubiculo Theatre under the direction of [[Brad Mays]]: ''Requiem,'' a fictionalized drama about Irish hunger striker [[Bobby Sands]], ''Joan,'' a short meditation on [[Joan of Arc]], and ''Stones,'' a two character piece of religious allegory.<ref>{{cite journal
