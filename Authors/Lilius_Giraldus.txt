'''Giglio Gregorio Giraldi''' ('''Lilius Gregorius Gyraldus''' or '''Giraldus''') (14 June 1479 – February 1552) was an [[Italy|Italian]] scholar and [[poet]].

He was born at [[Ferrara]], where he early distinguished himself by his talents and acquirements.

On the completion of his literary course, he removed to [[Naples]], where he lived on familiar terms with [[Jovianus Pontanus]] and [[Jacopo Sannazaro|Sannazaro]]; and subsequently to [[Lombardy]], where he enjoyed the favour of the Mirandola family. At [[Milan]] in 1507 he studied [[Greek language|Greek]] under [[Demetrius Chalcondylas|Chalcondylas]]; and shortly afterwards, at [[Modena]], he became tutor to Ercole (afterwards Cardinal) Rangone.

About the year 1514, he removed to [[Rome]], where, under [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]], he held the office of apostolic [[protonotary]]; but having in the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sack of that city]] (1527), which almost coincided with the death of his patron [[Ercole Rangone|Cardinal Rangone]], lost all his property, he returned in poverty once more to Mirandola, whence again he was driven by the troubles consequent on the assassination of the reigning prince in 1533.

The rest of his life was one long struggle with ill-health, poverty and neglect; and he is alluded to with sorrowful regret by [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]] in one of his ''Essais'' (i.35), as having, like [[Sebastian Castalio]], ended his days in utter destitution. He died at [[Ferrara]] in February 1552, and his [[epitaph]] makes touching and graceful allusion to the sadness of his end.

Giraldi was a man of very extensive erudition, and numerous testimonies to his profundity and accuracy have been given both by contemporary and by later scholars. His ''Historia de deis gentium'' (1548) marked a distinctly forward step in the systematic study of classical mythology; and by his treatises ''De annis et mensibus'', and on the ''Calendarium Romanum et Graecum'', he contributed to bring about the [[Gregorian calendar|reform of the calendar]], which was ultimately effected by [[Pope Gregory XIII]].

His ''Progymnasma adversus literas et literatos'' deserves mention at least among the curiosities of literature, and among his other works to which reference is still occasionally made are ''Historiae poëtarum Graecorum ac Latinorum''; ''De poëtis suorum temporum''; and ''De sepultura ac vario sepeliendi ritu''. Giraldi was also an elegant Latin poet.

His ''Opera omnia'' was published at Leiden in 1696.
