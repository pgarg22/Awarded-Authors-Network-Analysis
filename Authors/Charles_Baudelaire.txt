'''Charles Pierre Baudelaire''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|b|oʊ|d|ə|l|ɛər}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˌ|b|oʊ|d|(|ə|)|ˈ|l|ɛər}};<ref>[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Baudelaire "Baudelaire"]. [[Merriam-Webster]].</ref> {{IPA-fr|ʃaʁl bodlɛʁ|lang|Fr-Charles Baudelaire.oga}}; 9 April 1821 – 31 August 1867) was a [[French poetry|French poet]] who also produced notable work as an [[essay]]ist and [[art critic]]. His poems exhibit mastery in the handling of rhyme and rhythm, contain an exoticism inherited from Romantics, but are based on observations of real life.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Norwich|first=John Julius|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/11814265|title=Oxford illustrated encyclopedia|date=1985–1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Judge, Harry George., Toyne, Anthony.|isbn=0-19-869129-7|location=Oxford [England]|pages=38|oclc=11814265}}</ref>

His most famous work, a book of [[lyric poetry]] titled ''[[Les Fleurs du mal]]'' (''The Flowers of Evil''), expresses the changing nature of beauty in the rapidly industrializing Paris during the mid-19th century. Baudelaire's highly original style of prose-poetry influenced a whole generation of poets including [[Paul Verlaine]], [[Arthur Rimbaud]] and [[Stéphane Mallarmé]], among many others. He is credited with coining the term [[modernity]] (''modernité'') to designate the fleeting, ephemeral experience of life in an urban metropolis, and the responsibility of artistic expression to capture that experience.<ref>"By modernity I mean the transitory, the fugitive, the contingent which make up one half of art, the other being the eternal and the immutable." Charles Baudelaire, "The Painter of Modern Life" in ''The Painter of Modern Life and Other Essays'', edited and translated by Jonathan Mayne. London: Phaidon Press, 13.</ref>

==Early life==
Baudelaire was born in Paris, France, on 9 April 1821, and baptized two months later at [[Saint-Sulpice, Paris|Saint-Sulpice]] Roman Catholic Church.<ref>Charles Baudelaire, Richard Howard.

The following year, Caroline married Lieutenant Colonel Jacques Aupick, who later became a French ambassador to various noble courts. Baudelaire's biographers have often seen this as a crucial moment, considering that finding himself no longer the sole focus of his mother's affection left him with a trauma, which goes some way to explaining the excesses later apparent in his life. He stated in a letter to her that, "There was in my childhood a period of passionate love for you."<ref>Richardson 1994, p. 16</ref> Baudelaire regularly begged his mother for money throughout his career, often promising that a lucrative publishing contract or journalistic commission was just around the corner.

Baudelaire was educated in [[Lyon]], where he boarded. At 14, he was described by a classmate as "much more refined and distinguished than any of our fellow pupils...we are bound to one another...by shared tastes and sympathies, the precocious love of fine works of literature."<ref>Richardson 1994, p. 35</ref> Baudelaire was erratic in his studies, at times diligent, at other times prone to "idleness". Later, he attended the [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]] in Paris, studying law, a popular course for those not yet decided on any particular career. He began to frequent prostitutes and may have contracted gonorrhea and syphilis during this period. He also began to run up debts, mostly for clothes. Upon gaining his degree in 1839, he told his brother "I don't feel I have a vocation for anything." His stepfather had in mind a career in law or diplomacy, but instead Baudelaire decided to embark upon a literary career. His mother later recalled: "Oh, what grief! If Charles had let himself be guided by his stepfather, his career would have been very different...He would not have left a name in literature, it is true, but we should have been happier, all three of us."<ref>Richardson 1994, p. 70</ref>

[[File:Baudelaire 1844 cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of a 23-year-old Baudelaire, painted in 1844 by Émile Deroy (1820–1846)]]
His stepfather sent him on a voyage to Calcutta, India in 1841 in the hope of ending his dissolute habits. The trip provided strong impressions of the sea, sailing, and exotic ports, that he later employed in his poetry.<ref>Richardson 1994, pp. 67–68</ref> (Baudelaire later exaggerated his aborted trip to create a legend about his youthful travels and experiences, including "riding on elephants".) On returning to the taverns of Paris, he began to compose some of the poems of "Les Fleurs du Mal". At 21, he received a sizable inheritance but squandered much of it within a few years. His family obtained a decree to place his property in trust,<ref>Richardson 1994, p. 71</ref> which he resented bitterly, at one point arguing that allowing him to fail financially would have been the one sure way of teaching him to keep his finances in order.

Baudelaire became known in artistic circles as a [[dandy]] and free-spender, going through much of his inheritance and allowance in a short period of time. During this time, [[Jeanne Duval]] became his mistress. She was rejected by his family. His mother thought Duval a "Black Venus" who "tortured him in every way" and drained him of money at every opportunity.<ref>Richardson 1994, p. 75</ref> Baudelaire made a suicide attempt during this period.

He took part in the [[Revolutions of 1848 in France|Revolutions of 1848]] and wrote for a revolutionary newspaper. However, his interest in politics was passing, as he was later to note in his journals.

In the early 1850s, Baudelaire struggled with poor health, pressing debts, and irregular literary output. He often moved from one lodging to another to escape creditors. He undertook many projects that he was unable to complete, though he did finish translations of stories by [[Edgar Allan Poe]].

Upon the death of his stepfather in 1857, Baudelaire received no mention in the will but he was heartened nonetheless that the division with his mother might now be mended. At 36, he wrote to her: "believe that I belong to you absolutely, and that I belong only to you."<ref>Richardson 1994, p. 219.</ref> His mother died on 16 August 1871, outliving her son by almost four years.

==Publishing career==
His first published work, under the pseudonym Baudelaire Dufaÿs,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Vicaire|first1=Georges|title=Manual de L'Amateur de Livres du XIXe Siècle: 1801-1893|date=1894|publisher=Librairie A. Rouquette|location=Paris|volume=1|page=339}}</ref> was his art review "Salon of 1845", which attracted immediate attention for its boldness. Many of his critical opinions were novel in their time, including his championing of [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]], and some of his views seem remarkably in tune with the future theories of the Impressionist painters.

In 1846, Baudelaire wrote his second Salon review, gaining additional credibility as an advocate and critic of [[Romanticism]]. His continued support of [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]] as the foremost Romantic artist gained widespread notice.<ref name = "crapkq">Richardson 1994, p. 110.</ref> The following year Baudelaire's novella ''[[La Fanfarlo]]'' was published.

===''The Flowers of Evil''===
[[Image:Fleurs du mal.jpg|thumb|upright|The first edition of ''[[Les Fleurs du mal]]'' with author's notes]]
Baudelaire was a slow and very attentive worker. However, he often was sidetracked by indolence, emotional distress and illness, and it was not until 1857 that he published ''[[Les Fleurs du mal]]'' (''The Flowers of Evil''), his first and most famous volume of poems.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=Carol|title=Selected Poems|section=Notes on the Text|date=1995|publisher=Penguin Books Ltd.|location=By Charles Baudelaire. London|isbn=978-0-14-044624-1|page=xxiii}}</ref> Some of these poems had already appeared in the ''[[Revue des deux mondes]]'' (''Review of Two Worlds'') in 1855, when they were published by Baudelaire's friend [[Auguste Poulet Malassis]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=537}}<ref>Baudelaire, Charles. Les Fleurs du mal. Paris: ''Revue des Deux Mondes'' (XXVe année, seconde série de la nouvelle période, tome dixième), 1855. pp. 1079–1093</ref> Some of the poems had appeared as "fugitive verse" in various French magazines during the previous decade.<ref>Huneker, James. Introductory preface to: ''The Poems and Prose Poems of Charles Baudelaire''. New York: Brentano's, 1919. p. xvii</ref>

The poems found a small, yet appreciative audience. However, greater public attention was given to their subject matter. The effect on fellow artists was, as [[Théodore de Banville]] stated, "immense, prodigious, unexpected, mingled with admiration and with some indefinable anxious fear".<ref>Richardson 1994, p. 236.</ref> [[Gustave Flaubert]], recently attacked in a similar fashion for ''[[Madame Bovary]]'' (and acquitted), was impressed and wrote to Baudelaire: "You have found a way to rejuvenate Romanticism...You are as unyielding as marble, and as penetrating as an English mist."<ref>Richardson 1994, p. 241.</ref>

The principal themes of sex and death were considered scandalous for the period. He also touched on lesbianism, sacred and profane love, metamorphosis, melancholy, the corruption of the city, lost innocence, the oppressiveness of living, and wine. Notable in some poems is Baudelaire's use of imagery of the sense of smell and of fragrances, which is used to evoke feelings of nostalgia and past intimacy.<ref>Richardson 1994, p. 231.</ref>

The book, however, quickly became a byword for unwholesomeness among mainstream critics of the day. Some critics called a few of the poems "masterpieces of passion, art and poetry," but other poems were deemed to merit no less than legal action to suppress them.<ref>Richardson 1994, pp. 232–237</ref> J. Habas led the charge against Baudelaire, writing in ''[[Le Figaro]]'': "Everything in it which is not hideous is incomprehensible, everything one understands is putrid." Baudelaire responded to the outcry in a prophetic letter to his mother:
<blockquote>
"You know that I have always considered that literature and the arts pursue an aim independent of morality. Beauty of conception and style is enough for me. But this book, whose title (''Fleurs du mal'') says everything, is clad, as you will see, in a cold and sinister beauty. It was created with rage and patience. Besides, the proof of its positive worth is in all the ill that they speak of it. The book enrages people. Moreover, since I was terrified myself of the horror that I should inspire, I cut out a third from the proofs. They deny me everything, the spirit of invention and even the knowledge of the French language. I don't care a rap about all these imbeciles, and I know that this book, with its virtues and its faults, will make its way in the memory of the lettered public, beside the best poems of V. Hugo, Th. Gautier and even Byron."<ref>Richardson 1994, p. 238.</ref>
</blockquote>

[[File:Rops Les Epaves 1866.jpg|thumb|upright|Illustration cover for ''Les Épaves'', by Baudelaire's friend [[Félicien Rops]]]]
Baudelaire, his publisher and the printer  were successfully prosecuted for creating an offense against public morals. They were fined, but Baudelaire was not imprisoned.<ref>Richardson 1994, p. 248</ref> Six of the poems were suppressed, but printed later as ''Les Épaves'' (''The Wrecks'') (Brussels, 1866). Another edition of ''Les Fleurs du mal'', without these poems, but with considerable additions, appeared in 1861. Many notables rallied behind Baudelaire and condemned the sentence. [[Victor Hugo]] wrote to him: "Your ''fleurs du mal'' shine and dazzle like stars...I applaud your vigorous spirit with all my might."<ref name = "yvjown">Richardson 1994, p. 250.</ref> Baudelaire did not appeal the judgment, but his fine was reduced. Nearly 100 years later, on May 11, 1949, Baudelaire was vindicated, the judgment officially reversed, and the six banned poems reinstated in France.<ref name = "yvjown"/>

In the poem "Au lecteur" ("To the Reader") that prefaces ''Les Fleurs du mal'', Baudelaire accuses his readers of hypocrisy and of being as guilty of sins and lies as the poet:

:... If rape or arson, poison or the knife
:Has wove no pleasing patterns in the stuff
:Of this drab canvas we accept as life—
:It is because we are not bold enough!
::([[Roy Campbell (poet)|Roy Campbell]]'s translation)

==Final years==
[[File:Charles Baudelaire.jpg|thumb|left|Charles Baudelaire by [[Nadar (photographer)|Nadar]], 1855]]
Baudelaire next worked on a translation and adaptation of [[Thomas De Quincey]]'s ''[[Confessions of an English Opium-Eater]]''.<ref>Richardson 1994, p. 311.</ref> Other works in the years that followed included ''[[Le Spleen de Paris|Petits Poèmes en prose]]'' (''Small [[prose poetry|Prose poems]]''); a series of art reviews published in the ''Pays, Exposition universelle'' (''Country, World Fair''); studies on [[Gustave Flaubert]] (in ''[[L'Artiste]]'', October 18, 1857); on [[Théophile Gautier]] (''Revue contemporaine'', September 1858); various articles contributed to Eugène Crépet's ''Poètes français''; ''[[Les Paradis artificiels]]: opium et haschisch'' (''French poets; Artificial Paradises: opium and hashish'') (1860); and ''Un Dernier Chapitre de l'histoire des oeuvres de Balzac'' (''A Final Chapter of the history of works of Balzac'') (1880), originally an article "Comment on paye ses dettes quand on a du génie" ("How one pays one's debts when one has genius"), in which his criticism turns against his friends [[Honoré de Balzac]], [[Théophile Gautier]], and [[Gérard de Nerval]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=537}}

By 1859, his illnesses, his long-term use of [[laudanum]], his life of stress, and his poverty had taken a toll and Baudelaire had aged noticeably. But at last, his mother relented and agreed to let him live with her for a while at [[Honfleur]]. Baudelaire was productive and at peace in the seaside town, his poem ''Le Voyage'' being one example of his efforts during that time.<ref>Richardson 1994, p. 281.</ref> In 1860, he became an ardent supporter of [[Richard Wagner]].

His financial difficulties increased again, however, particularly after his publisher Poulet Malassis went bankrupt in 1861. In 1864, he left Paris for Belgium, partly in the hope of selling the rights to his works and to give lectures.<ref>Richardson 1994, p. 400</ref> His long-standing relationship with [[Jeanne Duval]] continued on-and-off, and he helped her to the end of his life. Baudelaire's relationships with actress Marie Daubrun and with courtesan [[Apollonie Sabatier]], though the source of much inspiration, never produced any lasting satisfaction. He smoked [[opium]], and in Brussels he began to drink to excess. Baudelaire suffered a massive stroke in 1866 and paralysis followed. After more than a year of [[aphasia]], he received the [[last rites]] of the Catholic Church.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/baudelaire/englishintro.html|title=Baudelaire: Une Micro-Histoire}}</ref> The last two years of his life were spent in a semi-paralyzed state in various [[Sanatorium|"maisons de santé"]] in Brussels and in Paris, where he died on 31 August 1867. Baudelaire is buried in the [[Cimetière du Montparnasse]], Paris.

Many of Baudelaire's works were published posthumously. After his death, his mother paid off his substantial debts, and she found some comfort in Baudelaire's emerging fame. "I see that my son, for all his faults, has his place in literature." She lived another four years.

==Poetry==
{{blockquote|Who among us has not dreamt, in moments of ambition, of the miracle of a poetic prose, musical without rhythm and rhyme, supple and staccato enough to adapt to the lyrical stirrings of the soul, the undulations of dreams, and sudden leaps of consciousness. This obsessive idea is above all a child of giant cities, of the intersecting of their myriad relations.|Dedication of ''[[Le Spleen de Paris]]}}

Baudelaire is one of the major innovators in French literature. His poetry is influenced by the French romantic poets of the earlier 19th century, although its attention to the formal features of verse connects it more closely to the work of the contemporary "Parnassians". As for theme and tone, in his works we see the rejection of the belief in the supremacy of nature and the fundamental goodness of man as typically espoused by the romantics and expressed by them in rhetorical, effusive and public voice in favor of a new urban sensibility, an awareness of individual moral complexity, an interest in vice (linked with [[Decadent movement|decadence]]) and refined sensual and aesthetic pleasures, and the use of urban subject matter, such as the city, the crowd, individual passers-by, all expressed in highly ordered verse, sometimes through a cynical and ironic voice. Formally, the use of sound to create atmosphere, and of "symbols" (images that take on an expanded function within the poem), betray a move towards considering the poem as a self-referential object, an idea further developed by the Symbolists [[Paul Verlaine|Verlaine]] and [[Stéphane Mallarmé|Mallarmé]], who acknowledge Baudelaire as a pioneer in this regard.

Beyond his innovations in versification and the theories of symbolism and "correspondences", an awareness of which is essential to any appreciation of the literary value of his work, aspects of his work that regularly receive much critical discussion include the role of women, the theological direction of his work and his alleged advocacy of "satanism", his experience of drug-induced states of mind, the figure of the dandy, his stance regarding democracy and its implications for the individual, his response to the spiritual uncertainties of the time, his criticisms of the bourgeois, and his advocacy of modern music and painting (e.g., [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]]). He made Paris the subject of modern poetry. He brought the city's details to life in the eyes and hearts of his readers.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Haine|first1=Scott|title=The History of France|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=0-313-30328-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/historyoffrance00hain/page/112 112]|edition= 1st|url=https://archive.org/details/historyoffrance00hain/page/112|year=2000}}</ref>

==Critiques==
Baudelaire was an active participant in the artistic life of his times. As critic and essayist, he wrote extensively and perceptively about the luminaries and themes of French culture. He was frank with friends and enemies, rarely took the diplomatic approach and sometimes responded violently verbally, that often undermined his cause.<ref>Richardson 1994, p. 268.</ref> His associations were numerous, including [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Honoré Daumier]], [[Félicien Rops]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Champfleury]], [[Victor Hugo]], [[Gustave Flaubert]], and [[Balzac]].

===Edgar Allan Poe===
In 1847, Baudelaire became acquainted with the works of [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]], in which he found tales and poems that had, he claimed, long existed in his own brain but never taken shape. Baudelaire saw in Poe a precursor and tried to be his French contemporary counterpart.<ref>Richardson 1994, p. 140.</ref> From this time until 1865, he was largely occupied with translating Poe's works; his translations were widely praised. Baudelaire was not the first French translator of Poe, but his "scrupulous translations" were considered among the best. These were published as ''Histoires extraordinaires'' (''Extraordinary stories'') (1856), ''Nouvelles histoires extraordinaires'' (''New extraordinary stories'') (1857), ''[[The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket|Aventures d'Arthur Gordon Pym]]'', ''[[Eureka: A Prose Poem|Eureka]]'', and ''Histoires grotesques et sérieuses'' (''Grotesque and serious stories'') (1865). Two essays on Poe are to be found in his ''Œuvres complètes'' (''Complete works'') (vols. v. and vi.).

===Eugène Delacroix===
A strong supporter of the Romantic painter [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]], Baudelaire called him "a poet in painting". Baudelaire also absorbed much of Delacroix's aesthetic ideas as expressed in his journals. As Baudelaire elaborated in his "Salon of 1846", "As one contemplates his series of pictures, one seems to be attending the celebration of some grievous mystery...This grave and lofty melancholy shines with a dull light.. plaintive and profound like a melody by Weber."<ref name = "crapkq"/> Delacroix, though appreciative, kept his distance from Baudelaire, particularly after the scandal of ''Les Fleurs du mal''. In private correspondence, Delacroix stated that Baudelaire "really gets on my nerves" and he expressed his unhappiness with Baudelaire's persistent comments about "melancholy" and "feverishness".<ref>{{cite book |first=Lois Boe |last=Hyslop |title=Baudelaire, Man of His Time |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1980 |page=[https://archive.org/details/baudelairemanofh0000hysl/page/14 14] |isbn=0-300-02513-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/baudelairemanofh0000hysl/page/14 }}</ref>

===Richard Wagner===
Baudelaire had no formal musical training, and knew little of composers beyond [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]]. Weber was in some ways [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s precursor, using the [[leitmotif]] and conceiving the idea of the "total art work" ("Gesamtkunstwerk"), both of which gained Baudelaire's admiration. Before even hearing Wagner's music, Baudelaire studied reviews and essays about him, and formulated his impressions. Later, Baudelaire put them into his non-technical analysis of Wagner, which was highly regarded, particularly his essay "Richard Wagner et Tannhäuser à Paris".<ref name = "yhkyza">Hyslop (1980), p. 68.</ref> Baudelaire's reaction to music was passionate and psychological. "Music engulfs (possesses) me like the sea."<ref name = "yhkyza"/> After attending three Wagner concerts in Paris in 1860, Baudelaire wrote to the composer: "I had a feeling of pride and joy in understanding, in being possessed, in being overwhelmed, a truly sensual pleasure like that of rising in the air."<ref>Hyslop (1980), p. 69</ref> Baudelaire's writings contributed to the elevation of Wagner and to the cult of [[Wagner controversies|Wagnerism]] that swept Europe in the following decades.

===Théophile Gautier===
[[Théophile Gautier|Gautier]], writer and poet, earned Baudelaire's respect for his perfection of form and his mastery of language, though Baudelaire thought he lacked deeper emotion and spirituality. Both strove to express the artist's inner vision, which [[Heinrich Heine]] earlier stated: "In artistic matters, I am a supernaturalist. I believe that the artist can not find all his forms in nature, but that the most remarkable are revealed to him in his soul."<ref>Hyslop (1980), p. 131.</ref> Gautier's frequent meditations on death and the horror of life are themes which influenced Baudelaire's writings. In gratitude for their friendship and commonality of vision, Baudelaire dedicated ''Les Fleurs du mal'' to Gautier.

===Édouard Manet===

[[File:Edouard Manet - Manet-98302 - Charles Baudelaire (1865).jpg|thumb|{{lang|fr|Charles Baudelaire, de face}} (1869 print of 1865 etching) by [[Édouard Manet]] ]]

[[Édouard Manet|Manet]] and Baudelaire became constant companions from around 1855. In the early 1860s, Baudelaire accompanied Manet on daily sketching trips and often met him socially. Manet also lent Baudelaire money and looked after his affairs, particularly when Baudelaire went to Belgium. Baudelaire encouraged Manet to strike out on his own path and not succumb to criticism. "Manet has great talent, a talent which will stand the test of time. But he has a weak character. He seems to me crushed and stunned by shock."<ref>Hyslop (1980), p. 55.</ref> In his painting ''[[Music in the Tuileries]]'', Manet includes portraits of his friends [[Théophile Gautier]], [[Jacques Offenbach]], and Baudelaire.<ref>{{cite web | title = Music in the Tuileries Gardens | publisher=[[National Gallery (London)|The National Gallery]] | url = http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=ng3260 | access-date =July 13, 2008}}</ref> While it's difficult to differentiate who influenced whom, both Manet and Baudelaire discussed and expressed some common themes through their respective arts. Baudelaire praised the modernity of Manet's subject matter: "almost all our originality comes from the stamp that 'time' imprints upon our feelings."<ref>Hyslop (1980), p. 53.</ref> When Manet's famous ''[[Olympia (painting)|Olympia]]'' (1863), a portrait of a nude prostitute, provoked a scandal for its blatant realism mixed with an imitation of [[Sleeping Venus (Giorgione)|Renaissance motifs]], Baudelaire worked privately to support his friend, though he offered no public defense (he was, however, ill at the time). When Baudelaire returned from Belgium after his stroke, Manet and his wife were frequent visitors at the nursing home and she played passages from Wagner for Baudelaire on the piano.<ref>Hyslop (1980), p. 51.</ref>

===Nadar===
[[Nadar (photographer)|Nadar]] (Félix Tournachon) was a noted caricaturist, scientist and important early photographer. Baudelaire admired Nadar, one of his close friends, and wrote: "Nadar is the most amazing manifestation of vitality."<ref>Hyslop (1980), p. 65.</ref> They moved in similar circles and Baudelaire made many social connections through him. Nadar's ex-mistress [[Jeanne Duval]] became Baudelaire's mistress around 1842. Baudelaire became interested in photography in the 1850s, and denouncing it as an art form, advocated its return to "its real purpose, which is that of being the servant to the sciences and arts". Photography should not, according to Baudelaire, encroach upon "the domain of the impalpable and the imaginary".<ref>Hyslop (1980), p. 63.</ref> Nadar remained a stalwart friend right to Baudelaire's last days and wrote his obituary notice in ''[[Le Figaro]]''.

==Philosophy==
Many of Baudelaire's philosophical proclamations were considered scandalous and intentionally provocative in his time. He wrote on a wide range of subjects, drawing criticism and outrage from many quarters. Along with Poe, Baudelaire named the arch-reactionary [[Joseph de Maistre]] as his ''[[maître à penser]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://assets.cambridge.org/052183/094X/excerpt/052183094X_excerpt.htm|title=The Cambridge Companion to Baudelaire|work=cambridge.org}}</ref> and adopted increasingly aristocratic views. In his journals, he wrote "There is no form of rational and assured government save an aristocracy. […] There are but three beings worthy of respect: the priest, the warrior and the poet. To know, to kill and to create. The rest of mankind may be taxed and drudged, they are born for the stable, that is to say, to practise what they call professions."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=2005_Q3_1/uvaBook/tei/z000000101.xml;chunk.id=d32;toc.depth=1;toc.id=d32;brand=default|title=Intimate journals :: :: University of Virginia Library|work=virginia.edu}}</ref>

==Influence and legacy==
[[Image:Gustave Courbet 033.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait by [[Gustave Courbet]], 1848]]
Baudelaire's influence on the direction of modern French (and English) language literature was considerable. The most significant French writers to come after him were generous with tributes; four years after his death, [[Arthur Rimbaud]] praised him in a letter as 'the king of poets, a true God'.<ref>Rimbaud, Arthur: ''Oeuvres complètes'', p. 253, NRF/Gallimard, 1972.</ref> In 1895, [[Stéphane Mallarmé]] published "Le Tombeau de Charles Baudelaire", a sonnet in Baudelaire's memory. [[Marcel Proust]], in an essay published in 1922, stated that along with [[Alfred de Vigny]], Baudelaire was "the greatest poet of the nineteenth century".<ref>''Concerning Baudelaire'' in Proust, Marcel: ''Against Sainte-Beuve and Other Essays'', p. 286, trans. John Sturrock, Penguin, 1994.</ref>

In the English-speaking world, [[Edmund Wilson]] credited Baudelaire as providing an initial impetus for the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] movement by virtue of his translations of Poe.<ref>Wilson, Edmund: ''Axel's Castle'', p. 20, Fontana, 1962 (originally published 1931).</ref> In 1930, [[T.S. Eliot]], while asserting that Baudelaire had not yet received a "just appreciation" even in France, claimed that the poet had "great genius" and asserted that his "technical mastery which can hardly be overpraised...has made his verse an inexhaustible study for later poets, not only in his own language".<ref>'Baudelaire', in Eliot, T.S.: ''Selected Essays'', pp. 422 and 425, Faber & Faber, 1961.</ref> In a lecture delivered in French on "Edgar Allan Poe and France" (Edgar Poe et la France) in Aix-en-Provence in April 1948, Eliot stated that "I am an English poet of American origin who learnt his art under the aegis of Baudelaire and the Baudelairian lineage of poets."<ref>Eliot, T.S.: Typescript, Hayward Bequest [held at King's College Archives, University of Cambridge]; subsequently adapted for the lecture later published as ''From Poe to Valéry'', The Hudson Review Vol. 2, No. 3 (Autumn, 1949), pp. 327-342</ref> Eliot also alluded to Baudelaire's poetry directly in his own poetry. For example, he quoted the last line of Baudelaire's "Au Lecteur" in the last line of Section I of ''[[The Waste Land]]''.'{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

At the same time that Eliot was affirming Baudelaire's importance from a broadly conservative and explicitly Christian viewpoint,<ref>cf. Eliot, 'Religion in Literature', in Eliot, op. cit., p. 388.</ref> [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] critics such as Wilson and [[Walter Benjamin]] were able to do so from a dramatically different perspective. Benjamin translated Baudelaire's ''Tableaux Parisiens'' into German and published a major essay on translation<ref>'The Task of the Translator', in Benjamin, Walter: ''Selected Writings Vol. 1: 1913–1926'', pp. 253–263, Belknap/Harvard, 1996.</ref> as the foreword.

In the late 1930s, Benjamin used Baudelaire as a starting point and focus for ''[[Arcades Project|Das Passagenwerk]]'', his monumental attempt at a [[Historical materialism|materialist]] assessment of 19th-century culture.<ref>Benjamin, Walter: ''The Arcades Project'', trans. Howard Eiland and Kevin McLaughlin, Belknap/Harvard, 1999.</ref> For Benjamin, Baudelaire's importance lay in his anatomies of the crowd, of the city and of modernity.<ref>{{citation | last = Benjamin | first = Walter | author-link = Walter Benjamin | contribution = The Paris of the Second Empire in Baudelaire | editor-last = Benjamin | editor-first = Walter | editor-link = Walter Benjamin | title = Selected writings: Vol. 4 1938–1940 | pages = 3–92 | publisher = Belknap Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1996 | isbn = 9780674010765 | postscript = .}}</ref> He says that, in ''[[Les Fleurs du mal]]'', "the specific devaluation of the world of things, as manifested in the commodity, is the foundation of Baudelaire's allegorical intention."<ref>{{citation | last = Benjamin | first = Walter | author-link = Walter Benjamin | contribution = The study begins with some reflections on the influence of ''Les Fleurs du mal'' | editor-last = Benjamin | editor-first = Walter | editor-link = Walter Benjamin | title = Selected writings: Vol. 4 1938–1940 | pages = 94–98 | publisher = Belknap Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1996 | isbn = 9780674010765 | postscript = .}}

[[François Porche]] published a poetry collection called ''Charles Baudelaire: Poetry Collection'' in memory of Baudelaire.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The novel ''A Singular Conspiracy'' (1974) by [[Barry Perowne]] is a fictional treatment of the unaccounted period in [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s life from January to May 1844, in which (among other things) Poe becomes involved with a young Baudelaire in a plot to expose Baudelaires' stepfather to blackmail, to free up Baudelaires' patrimony.
