'''Cao Cao''' ({{audio|Cao Cao.ogg|pronunciation}}; {{IPAc-cmn|c|ao|2|-|c|ao|1}}; {{zh|c=曹操}}; 155 – 15 March 220),{{sfnp|de Crespigny|2007|pp=35, 38}} [[courtesy name]] '''Mengde''' ({{zh|c=孟德}}), was a Chinese warlord, statesman and poet. He was the penultimate [[Grand chancellor (China)|grand chancellor]] of the [[Eastern Han dynasty]] who rose to great power in the [[End of the Han dynasty|final years of the dynasty]]. As one of the central figures of the [[Three Kingdoms]] period, he laid the foundations for what was to become the state of [[Cao Wei]] and was posthumously honoured as "Emperor Wu of Wei" although he never officially claimed the title [[Emperor of China]] or proclaimed himself  "[[Son of Heaven]]" during his lifetime. He remains a controversial historical figure, and is often portrayed as a cruel and merciless tyrant in subsequent literature; however, he has also been praised as a brilliant ruler, military genius, and great poet with unrivalled charisma who treated his subordinates like his family.{{cn|date=April 2021}}

During the fall of the Eastern Han dynasty, Cao Cao was able to secure most of Northern China - the most populated and developed part of China. Cao Cao was also very successful in restoring public order and rebuilding the economy as the grand chancellor; however his manipulation of [[Emperor Xian of Han|Emperor Xian]] as a puppet and figurehead was heavily criticised, with state affairs effectively being controlled by Cao Cao instead of the emperor himself. Opposition directly gathered around warlords [[Liu Bei]] and [[Sun Quan]], whom Cao Cao was unable to quell.

Cao Cao was also skilled in [[Chinese poetry|poetry]], [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]] and [[Chinese martial arts|martial arts]] and wrote many war journals including remarks added to ''[[The Art of War]]'' written by [[Sun Tzu]]. He is remembered amongst the most eminent rulers of imperial China.{{cn|date=April 2021}}

==Early life==
{{Further|History of the Han dynasty}}

Cao Cao was born in Qiao, [[Principality of Pei]] (present-day [[Bozhou]], [[Anhui]]), in 155.<ref name="auto">de Crespigny (2010), p. 35</ref> His father [[Cao Song]] was a foster son of [[Cao Teng]], who in turn was one of the favourite [[eunuch]]s of [[Emperor Huan of Han|Emperor Huan]]. Some historical records, including the ''Biography of Cao Man'', claim that Cao Song's original family name was [[Xiahou]] and that he was thus a relative of [[Xiahou Dun]].<ref>Chen Shou. ''Records of Three Kingdoms'', Volume 1, Biography of Cao Cao. "吳人作曹瞞傳及郭頒世語並雲：嵩，夏侯氏之子，夏侯惇之叔父。太祖於惇為從父兄弟。嵩生太祖。" tr. "The Wu-authored Cao Man's Biography and Guo Ban's Tales of Generations both said that [Cao] Song is a Xiahou lineage's scion and Xiahou Dun's paternal junior uncle. [Cao Cao] and Dun are paternal first cousins. Song fathered [Cao Cao]"</ref>

Cao was known for his craftiness as an adolescent. According to the ''Biography of Cao Man'', Cao Cao's uncle complained to Cao Song about Cao Cao's indulgence in hunting and music with [[Yuan Shao]]. In retaliation, Cao Cao feigned a fit before his uncle, who immediately rushed to inform Cao Song. When Cao Song went to see his son, Cao Cao behaved normally. When asked, Cao Cao replied, "I have never had a fit, but I lost the love of my uncle, and therefore he deceived you." Afterwards, Cao Song ceased to believe his brother regarding Cao Cao, and thus Cao Cao became even more blatant and insistent in his wayward pursuits.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

At that time, there was a man named [[Xu Shao]] who lived in [[Runan Commandery|Runan]] and was famous for his ability to evaluate a person's potentials and talents. Cao Cao paid him a visit in hopes of receiving an evaluation that would help him politically. At first, Xu Shao refused to make a statement; however, under persistent questioning, he finally said, "You would be a capable minister in peaceful times and an unscrupulous hero in chaotic times."<ref>(治世之能臣，乱世之奸雄。) Chen Shou. ''Records of Three Kingdoms'', Volume 1, Biography of Cao Cao.</ref> Cao Cao laughed and left. There are two other versions of this comment in other unofficial historical records.{{which|date=January 2013}}

== Early career and Yellow Turban Rebellion (175–188) ==
[[File:Cao Cao statue.jpg|thumb|left|198px|Statue of Cao Cao in [[Wuhan]]]]

At the age of 20, Cao Cao was appointed district captain of [[Luoyang]]. Upon taking up the post, he placed rows of multicolored stakes outside his office and ordered his deputies to flog those who violated the law, regardless of their status. An uncle of [[Jian Shuo]], one of the most powerful and influential eunuchs under [[Emperor Ling of Han|Emperor Ling]], was caught walking in the city after the evening curfew by Cao Cao's men and was flogged. This prompted Jian Shuo and other higher authorities to ostensibly promote Cao Cao to the post of governor of [[Qingfeng County|Dunqiu County]] while actually moving him out of the imperial capital. Cao Cao remained in this position for little more than a year, being dismissed from office in 178 for his distant family ties with the disgraced [[Empress Song (Han dynasty)|Empress Song]].<ref>de Crespigny (2010), pp. 33–34</ref> Around 180, Cao Cao returned to court as a Consultant ({{lang|zh|議郎}}) and presented two memoranda against the eunuchs' influence in court and government corruption during his tenure, to limited effect.<ref name="auto"/>

When the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] broke out in 184, Cao Cao was recalled to Luoyang and appointed Captain of the Cavalry ({{lang|zh|騎都尉}}) and sent to [[Yingchuan]] in [[Yuzhou (ancient China)|Yu Province]] to suppress the rebels. He was successful and was sent to [[Jinan Commandery|Jinan]] as Chancellor ({{lang|zh|相}}) to prevent the spread of Yellow Turban influence there. In Jinan, Cao Cao aggressively enforced the ban on unorthodox cults, destroyed shrines, and supported state [[Confucianism]]. He offended the local leading families in the process, and resigned on grounds of poor health around 187, fearing that he had put his family in danger.<ref>de Crespigny (2010), p. 39</ref> He was offered the post of Administrator of [[Dong Commandery]] ({{lang|zh|東郡}}), but he declined and returned to his home in [[Pei County]]. Around that time, Wang Fen ({{lang|zh|王芬}}) tried to recruit Cao Cao to join his coup to replace Emperor Ling with the Marquis of Hefei, but Cao Cao refused. The plot came to nothing, and Wang Fen killed himself.<ref>de Crespigny (2010), p. 40</ref>

After 18 months in retirement, Cao Cao returned to the capital [[Luoyang]] in 188. That year, he was appointed Colonel Who Arranges the Army ({{lang|zh|典軍校尉}}), fourth of eight heads of a newly established imperial army, the [[Army of the Western Garden]]. The effectiveness of this new force was never tested, since it was disbanded the very next year.<ref>de Crespigny (2010), p. 43</ref>

In 189, Emperor Ling died and was succeeded by his eldest son ([[Liu Bian|Emperor Shao]]), although state power was mainly controlled by [[Empress He (Han dynasty)|Empress Dowager He]] and her advisors. The empress dowager's brother, General-in-Chief [[He Jin]], plotted with [[Yuan Shao]] to eliminate the [[Ten Attendants]] (a group of influential eunuchs in the imperial court). He Jin summoned [[Dong Zhuo]], a seasoned general of [[Liang Province]], to lead an army into [[Luoyang]] to pressure the empress dowager to surrender power, braving accusations of Dong's "infamy". But before Dong Zhuo arrived, He Jin was assassinated by the eunuchs and Luoyang was thrown into chaos as Yuan Shao's supporters [[Massacre of the Eunuchs|fought the eunuchs]]. Dong Zhuo's army easily rid the palace grounds of opposition. After he deposed Emperor Shao, Dong Zhuo placed the puppet [[Emperor Xian of Han|Emperor Xian]] on the throne, since he deemed that Emperor Xian was more capable than the original puppet Emperor Shao.

After rejecting Dong Zhuo's offer of appointment, Cao Cao left Luoyang for Chenliu (southeast of present-day [[Kaifeng]], [[Henan]], Cao's hometown), where he built an army. The next year, regional warlords [[Campaign against Dong Zhuo|formed a military alliance]] under Yuan Shao against Dong. Cao Cao joined them, becoming one of the few active fighting members of the coalition. Although the warlords liberated the capital of Luoyang, Dong Zhuo's court managed to flee westwards to the former capital of [[Chang'an]], abducting Emperor Xian. The coalition fell apart after months of inactivity, and China fell into civil war while Dong Zhuo was killed in 192 by [[Lü Bu]].

== Carving a territory (191–199) ==
[[File:End of Han Dynasty Warlords.png|thumb|450px|Map showing the major warlords of the Han dynasty in the early 190s, including Cao Cao]]

=== Conquest of Yan Province (191–195) ===
{{Main|Cao Cao's invasion of Xu Province|Battle of Yan Province}}

Through short-term and regional-scale wars, Cao Cao continued to expand his power. In 191, Cao Cao was appointed Administrator of Dong commandery (Dongjun) in [[Chenliu]]. This happened after he successfully fought against the bandit chieftain Bo Rao, and Yuan Shao named him Administrator in the stead of the ineffectual Wang Hong. He cleared Dong of bandits, and when the Inspector of [[Yan Province]] [[Liu Dai]] died the following year, he was invited by [[Bao Xin]] and other officers to become the Governor of Yan Province, and deal with an uprising of Yellow Turbans in [[Qing Province]] who raided Yan. Despite several setbacks, Cao Cao managed to subdue the rebels by the end of 192, likely through negotiations, and added their 30,000 troops to his army.<ref name="2006dict36">{{Cite book |last=de Crespigny |first=Rafe |date=2006 |title=A Biographical Dictionary of Later Han to the Three Kingdoms (23-220 AD) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=49OvCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA35 |location=Leiden |publisher=Brill |pages=35–39 |isbn=9789047411840 |access-date=30 April 2018}}</ref> In early 193, Cao Cao and Yuan Shao fought against the latter's cousin [[Yuan Shu]] in several battles such as [[Battle of Fengqiu|Fengqiu]], driving him away to the River Huai.{{sfnp|de Crespigny|2007|p=36}}

Cao Cao's father [[Cao Song]] was killed in autumn 193 by troops of [[Tao Qian (Han dynasty)|Tao Qian]], governor of [[Xuzhou (ancient China)|Xu Province]] (who claimed to be innocent, and that Cao Song's murderers had been [[mutiny|mutineers]]). Enraged, Cao Cao massacred thousands of civilians in Xu during two punitive expeditions in 193 and 194, to avenge his father.<ref name="2006dict36"/> Because he took the bulk of his soldiers to Xu Province in order to defeat Tao Qian, most of his territory was left undefended. A number of discontented officers led by [[Chen Gong]] and Zhang Chao plotted to rebel. They convinced [[Zhang Miao]] (Zhang Chao's brother) to be their leader, and to ask [[Lü Bu]] to come with reinforcements. Chen Gong invited Lü Bu to be the new Inspector of Yan province. Lü Bu accepted this invitation and led his soldiers into the province. Since Cao Cao's army was away, many of the local commanders figured that fighting would be a lost cause and surrendered to Lü Bu as soon as he arrived. However three counties – Juancheng, Dong'a, and Fan, remained loyal to Cao Cao and when Cao Cao returned, he gathered his own forces at Juancheng.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

Throughout 194 and 195, Cao Cao and Lü Bu fought several battles of some size for the control of Yan Province. Though Lü Bu initially did well in holding [[Puyang]], Cao Cao won almost every engagement outside of Puyang. Cao Cao's decisive victory came in a battle near Dongming.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Lü Bu and Chen Gong led a large army to assault Cao Cao's forces. At that time, Cao Cao was out with a small army, harvesting grain. Seeing Lü Bu and Chen Gong approaching, Cao Cao hid his soldiers in some woods and behind a dam. He then sent a small force ahead to skirmish with Lü Bu's army. Once the two forces were committed, he unleashed his hidden soldiers. Lü Bu's army was devastated by this attack and many of his soldiers fled.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

Lü Bu and Chen Gong both fled after that battle. Since Xu province was now under [[Liu Bei]]'s command and Liu Bei had been Cao Cao's enemy in the past, they fled to Xu for safety. Cao Cao decided not to pursue them and instead set about crushing Lü Bu's loyalists in Yan, consolidating his hold over that province. Eighteen months after the rebellion started, Cao had destroyed Zhang Miao and his family, and regained Yan Province by the end of 195.<ref name="2006dict36"/>

=== Securing the emperor (196) ===
Cao Cao moved his headquarters in early 196 from Puyang to Xu City (許, present-day [[Xuchang]]), where he built military agricultural colonies for the settlement of refugees and supply of food for his troops.<ref name="2006dict36" />

Around August 196, [[Emperor Xian of Han|Emperor Xian]] returned to Luoyang under the escort of [[Yang Feng]] and [[Dong Cheng (Han dynasty)|Dong Cheng]]. Cao Cao joined Emperor Xian in autumn 196<ref name="2006dict36" /> and convinced him to move the capital to Xu City as suggested by [[Xun Yu]] and other advisors, as Luoyang was ruined by war and [[Chang'an]] was not under Cao's military control. He was appointed Minister of Works (after negotiating with his nominal superior Yuan Shao), and Director of Retainers (司隸 Sīlì), granting him nominal control over [[Sili Province]].<ref name="2006dict36" /> Furthermore, he became General-in-Chief (大將軍) and Marquis of Wuping (武平侯), though both titles had little practical application. While some viewed the emperor as a puppet under Cao Cao's control, Cao adhered to a strict personal code until his death that he would not usurp the throne. When he was approached by his advisors to overthrow the Han dynasty and start his own dynasty, he replied, "If heaven bestows such a fate upon me, let me be [[King Wen of Zhou]]."<ref>“若天命在吾，吾为周文王矣。” [[Chen Shou]]. ''[[Records of Three Kingdoms]]'', Volume 1, Biography of Cao Cao.</ref>{{NoteTag|[[King Wen of Zhou]] was a high official at the end of the [[Shang dynasty]] in ancient China. At the time, the corruption of [[King Zhou of Shang]] prompted many uprisings, including that of King Wen; but King Wen insisted that he would not take the throne himself as it is improper for him, a subordinate, to harm the Shang dynasty. Instead, he allowed his son ([[King Wu of Zhou]]) to destroy the Shang dynasty and establish the [[Zhou dynasty]] after his own death, and thus fulfilling his personal code of honour but also ridding the world of a terrible ruler. He was then named King Wen of Zhou posthumously by King Wu of Zhou. Here, Cao Cao was inferring that if the Cao family were to come to power and establish a new dynasty, it would be by his descendants and not him.}}

To maintain a good relationship with Yuan Shao, who had become the most powerful warlord in China when he united the northern four provinces, Cao Cao lobbied to have Yuan appointed Minister of Works. However, this had the opposite effect, as Yuan Shao believed that Cao Cao was trying to humiliate him, since Minister of Works technically ranked lower than General-in-Chief, and therefore refused to accept the title. To pacify Yuan Shao, Cao Cao offered his own position to him, while becoming Minister of Works himself. While this temporarily resolved the conflict, it was the catalyst for the [[Battle of Guandu]] later.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

=== Battling Zhang Xiu, Yuan Shu, and Lü Bu (197–198) ===
[[File:Dahuting Tomb mural, cavalry and chariots, Eastern Han Dynasty.jpg|thumb|400px|A mural showing chariots and cavalry, from the [[Dahuting]] Tomb of the late [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] (25–220 AD), located in Zhengzhou, Henan province, China]]
{{Further|War between Cao Cao and Zhang Xiu}}
[[Liu Biao]] was a major power at that time, holding all of Jing province. Jing had always been prosperous, but it had grown in size because many people fled from the northern wars and sought refuge there. Therefore, Liu Biao constituted a danger to Cao Cao. [[Zhang Xiu (warlord)|Zhang Xiu]] commanded Liu Biao's territory on the border with Cao Cao, so Cao Cao went to attack him. In early 197 Zhang Xiu surrendered to Cao Cao, but later attacked his camp in the night (the [[War between Cao Cao and Zhang Xiu#Battle of Wancheng|Battle of Wancheng]]), killing many people, including Cao Cao's son [[Cao Ang]], and forcing Cao Cao to flee.{{sfnp|de Crespigny|2007|p=36}}

After taking a few months to recover, Cao Cao turned his attention to [[Yuan Shu]], who had recently proclaimed himself emperor of his new Zhong dynasty. In the name of restoring the Han dynasty, Cao Cao and other warlords formed a [[Campaign against Yuan Shu|coalition against Yuan Shu]], and Cao Cao seized all Yuan Shu's holdings north of the Huai River in the autumn of 197, while the latter's remaining territory suffered drought and a bad harvest, further decreasing his power.{{sfnp|de Crespigny|2007|pp=1012–1013}}

Later in 197, Cao Cao returned south to attack Liu Biao/Zhang Xiu once more. This time, Cao Cao was very successful and greatly damaged their army. Cao Cao attacked Zhang Xiu again in 198 leading to the [[War between Cao Cao and Zhang Xiu|Battle of Rangcheng]] and was again victorious. He ultimately retreated from this campaign because he received word that Yuan Shao was planning to march on Xu, though this report turned out to be in error.{{sfnp|de Crespigny|2007|p=36}}

In April 198, Cao Cao sent envoys to incite the western warlords to attack Chang'an, still controlled by Dong Zhuo's successor [[Li Jue (Han dynasty)|Li Jue]]. One of Li Jue's subordinates, Duan Wei ({{lang|zh|段煨}}), mutinied and killed Li Jue along with his family in the summer of 198. Duan Wei sent Li Jue's head to Xu City (as a token of his submission to Cao Cao).<ref>de Crespigny, Rafe (2006), p. 418.</ref>

Meanwhile, Lü Bu was growing more aggressive. He drove Liu Bei (who fled to Cao Cao) out of his territory again and allied with Yuan Shu. Since Zhang Xiu had recently been crushed, he was in no position to be a threat in the south, so Cao Cao went east to deal with Lü Bu.{{sfnp|de Crespigny|2007|p=36}}

=== Conquest of Xu and Yu Provinces (199) ===
{{Further|Battle of Xiapi|Campaign against Yuan Shu}}

Cao Cao defeated Lü Bu in numerous battles and eventually surrounded him at [[Battle of Xiapi|Xiapi]]. Lü Bu tried to break free but could not do so. Ultimately, many of his officers and soldiers defected to Cao Cao. Some were kidnapped by defectors. Lü Bu grew disheartened and surrendered to Cao Cao, who executed him on 7 February 199.{{NoteTag|name=death date|The Australian sinologist [[Rafe de Crespigny]] wrote in ''A Biographical Dictionary of Later Han to the Three Kingdoms 23-220 AD'' that Lü Bu died in the year 198.{{sfnp|de Crespigny|2007|pp=624–625}} This date is incorrect even though the 3rd year of the Jian'an era of the reign of [[Emperor Xian of Han]] largely corresponds to the year 198 in the Gregorian calendar. That is because the 11th month of the 3rd year of Jian'an was from 16 December 198 to 14 January 199 in the Gregorian calendar, so the 12th month was already into the year 199. The ''Zizhi Tongjian'' recorded that Lü Bu surrendered to Cao Cao on the ''guiyou'' day of the 12th month of the 3rd year of the Jian'an era. He was executed on the same day.<ref>([侯]成忿懼，十二月，癸酉，成與諸將宋憲、魏續等共執陳宮、高順，率其衆降。[呂]布與麾下登白門樓。兵圍之急，布令左右取其首詣[曹]操，左右不忍，乃下降。 ... 宮請就刑，遂出，不顧，操為之泣涕，幷布、順皆縊殺之，傳首許市。操召陳宮之母，養之終其身，嫁宮女，撫視其家，皆厚於初。) ''Zizhi Tongjian'' vol. 62.</ref> This date corresponds to 7 February 199 in the Gregorian calendar.}} By eliminating Lü Bu, Cao had obtained effective control of Xu Province.<ref name="2006dict36" />

With Lü Bu gone, Cao Cao set about dealing with Yuan Shu. He sent Liu Bei and [[Zhu Ling (Three Kingdoms)|Zhu Ling]] south to attack Yuan Shu. However, the rebel emperor died in the summer of 199 before Liu Bei and the others arrived. This meant Cao Cao had no major opponents in the [[Huai River]] region ([[Yuzhou (ancient China)|Yu Province]]) anymore either.<ref name="2006dict36" /> Meanwhile, in March 199 Yuan Shao had finally finished his war with [[Gongsun Zan]] at the [[Battle of Yijing]], and was now planning to move south to defeat Cao Cao. Seeing this, Cao Cao set about preparing his defenses, intending to make his stand at Guandu. On the advice of [[Jia Xu]], Zhang Xiu surrendered to Cao Cao and his forces were integrated into Cao Cao's army after they rejected an envoy from Yuan Shao to ally.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

=== Liu Bei's betrayal and defeat ===

In 200, Yuan Shao marched southwards on Xu City in the name of rescuing the emperor.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020 |reason=Was that his stated objective?}} He had amassed more than 110,000 troops, including 10,000 heavy cavalry, while Cao Cao gathered around 40,000 men,<ref name="KandG"/>{{rp|at=4:52}} most of which he concentrated at [[Battle of Guandu|Guandu]], a strategic point on the [[Yellow River]].<ref name="KandG"/>{{rp|at=4:11}} Cao's army repeatedly repulsed Yuan's attacks and won tactical victories at [[Battle of Dushi Ford|Dushi Ford]] (February), [[Battle of Boma|Boma]] (March–May) and [[Battle of Yan Ford|Yan Ford]] (May–August).<ref name="KandG"/>{{rp|at=7:06}} The two armies came to a standstill at the [[Battle of Guandu]] (September–November), as neither side was able to make much progress.<ref name="KandG"/>{{rp|at=9:06}} Cao Cao's lack of men did not allow him to make significant attacks, and Yuan Shao's pride forced him to meet Cao's force head-on.

Besides the middle battleground of Guandu, two lines of battle were present. The eastern line with [[Yuan Tan]] of Yuan Shao's army against [[Zang Ba]] of Cao Cao's army was a one-sided battle in favour of Cao, as Yuan Tan's poor leadership was no match for Zang's local knowledge of the landscape and his hit-and-run tactics. On the western front, Yuan Shao's nephew, [[Gao Gan]], performed better against Cao Cao's army and forced several reinforcements from Cao's main camp to maintain the western battle. [[Liu Bei]], then a guest in Yuan Shao's army, suggested that he instigate rebellion in Cao Cao's territories as many followers of Yuan were in Cao's lands. The tactic was initially successful but [[Man Chong]]'s diplomatic skills helped to resolve the conflict almost immediately. Man Chong had been placed as an official there for this specific reason, as Cao Cao had foreseen the possibility of insurrection prior to the battle.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} A Cao raid destroying the Yuan supply depot at the village of Gushi forced Yuan Shao to set up an emergency supply depot at Wuchao.<ref name="KandG"/>{{rp|at=10:21}} Finally in the 10th month, a defector from Yuan Shao's army, [[Xu You (Han dynasty)|Xu You]],{{sfnp|de Crespigny|2007|p=37}} informed Cao Cao of the location of Yuan's new supply depot.<ref name="KandG"/>{{rp|at=11:01}} Cao Cao broke the stalemate by sending a special group of soldiers to Wuchao burn all the supplies of Yuan Shao's army, heavily demoralising it.

After Yuan Shao's defeat at Guandu in 200, Cao Cao forced Liu Bei to flee to the governor of [[Jingzhou (ancient China)|Jing Province]], Liu Biao, who stationed him at the northern border in [[Xinye County]] to keep Cao Cao at bay.{{sfnp|de Crespigny|2007|p=37}}<ref name="KandG RedCliffs"/>{{rp|at=1:48}} An initial Cao attack on Liu Bei was repelled during the [[Battle of Bowang]] (202).

=== Battle of Red Cliffs ===
{{main|Battle of Red Cliffs}}
At the [[Battle of Red Cliffs]] in the winter of 208, Cao Cao's forces were defeated by the coalition of [[Liu Bei]] and [[Sun Quan]] (who later founded the states of [[Shu Han]] and [[Eastern Wu]] respectively, becoming his arch-rivals in reunifying China).<ref name="Crespigny472"/> Despite superior numbers, the northern troops were exhausted from marching, prone to sickness in the unfamiliar southern climate and seasick on the river fleet (which they tried to mitigate by chaining the ships together), while especially the Sun soldiers were still fresh and experienced in riverine warfare. Allied general [[Huang Gai]] pretended to defect to the northerners, but took advantage of the fact that the Cao ships had been chained together to destroy them with [[fire ships]]. Meanwhile, an allied amphibious attack led by [[Zhou Yu]] routed Cao Cao's land forces at Wulin ({{lang|zh|烏林}}).<ref name="KandG RedCliffs"/>{{rp|at=10:30}}

Throughout 209 and 210, Cao Cao's commanders were engaged in defensive efforts against Sun Quan. In battles at [[Battle of Jiangling (208)|Jiangling]] and [[Battle of Yiling (208)|Yiling]], Cao Cao's commanders in northern Jing (such as [[Cao Ren]]) fought against Sun Quan. They experienced mixed success, and Cao Cao was able to retain some territory in the north of that province. At the same time, they held off an attack on [[Battle of Hefei (208)|Hefei]] and put down a revolt in [[Lu county rebellion|Lu]] that Sun Quan's forces tried to assist, keeping Sun Quan from moving to attack Shouchun. However, Cao Cao's commanders in southern Jing, cut off from the rest of Cao Cao's forces, surrendered to Liu Bei.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Liu Qi initially succeeded his father as Inspector of Jing Province, but died in 209, after which Sun Quan appointed Liu Bei as Governor of Jing Province, and married off his sister [[Lady Sun]] to him to cement the alliance.<ref>[[Sima Guang]], ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', vol. 65 (1084).</ref>

By 211, the situation in the south had stabilized and Cao Cao decided to crush his remaining enemies in the north, to the west of [[Chang'an]] (in [[Pingyi (region)|Zuopingyi Commandery]]). In Hanzhong commandery on the [[Han River (Hubei)|Han River]], in the north of [[Yi Province]], [[Zhang Lu (Han dynasty)|Zhang Lu]] lived{{sfnp|de Crespigny|2007|p=38}} in revolt against the Han dynasty, running his own theocratic state.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} Cao Cao sent Zhong Yao with an army to force Zhang Lu's surrender.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} However, this disturbed a number of warlords in the [[Wei River]] valley{{sfnp|de Crespigny|2007|p=38}} and the wider [[Liang Province rebellion|Liang Province]], who united under [[Han Sui]] and [[Ma Chao]] to oppose Cao Cao, believing that his maneuvers against Zhang Lu were actually directed at them.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} Cao Cao personally led the army against this alliance, and outmaneuvered the rebel army at every turn in the [[Battle of Tong Pass (211)|Battle of Tong Pass]].{{sfnp|de Crespigny|2007|p=38}} The alliance shattered and many of the leaders were killed. Cao Cao spent the next month or two hunting down some of the leaders, many of whom surrendered to him.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} He left [[Xiahou Yuan]] to clear up affairs in the region and returned home in 212.{{sfnp|de Crespigny|2007|p=38}} In 213, he launched an invasion into Sun Quan's territory across the river Huai, but was defeated in the [[Battle of Ruxu (213)|Battle of Ruxu]], which confirmed Sun's control of the south.{{sfnp|de Crespigny|2007|p=38}}

In 213, Cao Cao received the title "Duke of Wei" ({{lang|zh|魏公}}) and was given the [[nine bestowments]] and a fief of ten cities under his domain, known as Wei. That same year, he marched south and attacked Ruxu. Sun Quan's general [[Lü Meng]] held off the attacks for about a month, and Cao Cao had to pull back in the end. In 215, Cao Cao moved into and took over [[Battle of Yangping|Hanzhong]]. In 216, Cao Cao was promoted to the status of a [[vassal]] king – "King of Wei" ({{lang|zh|魏王}}). Over the years, Cao Cao, as well as Liu Bei and Sun Quan, continued to consolidate their power in their respective regions. Through many wars, China became divided into three powers&nbsp;– Wei, Shu and Wu, which fought sporadic battles without the balance tipping significantly in anyone's favour. The only exception was when Liu Bei's forces were able to take [[Hanzhong Campaign|Hanzhong]] from Cao Cao's army after a campaign that took two years.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

In 220, Cao Cao died in Luoyang at the age of 65, having failed to unify China under his rule, allegedly of a "head disease". His will instructed that he be buried near [[Ximen Bao]]'s tomb in [[Ye, China|Ye]] without gold and jade treasures, and that his subjects on duty at the frontier were to stay in their posts and not attend the funeral as, in his own words, "the country is still unstable".{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

Cao Cao's eldest surviving son [[Cao Pi]] succeeded him. Within a year, Cao Pi forced [[Emperor Xian of Han|Emperor Xian]] to abdicate and proclaimed himself the first emperor of the state of [[Cao Wei]]. Cao Cao was then posthumously titled "Grand Ancestor Emperor Wu of Wei" ({{lang|zh|魏太祖武皇帝}}).

As the novel ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'' has been adapted to modern forms of entertainment, so has its portrayal of Cao Cao. Given the source material upon which these adaptations are founded, Cao Cao continues to be characterised as a prominent villain.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

Through to modern times, the Chinese equivalent of the English idiom "[[speak of the Devil]]" is "speak of Cao Cao and Cao Cao arrives" ({{zh|t=說曹操，曹操到|s=说曹操，曹操到|p=shuō Cáo Cāo, Cáo Cāo dào}}).{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

After the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] won the [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949, some people in China thought there might be some similarities between Cao Cao and [[Mao Zedong]]. In 1959, [[Peng Dehuai]] wrote a letter to Mao, in which he compared himself to [[Zhang Fei]]: because Mao Zedong compares himself to Cao Cao, Peng's comparison implied that he had an intuitively confrontational relationship with Mao. Mao had the letter widely circulated in order to make Peng's attitude clear to other Party members, and proceeded to purge Peng, eventually ending Peng's career.<ref>Domes, p. 91</ref>

''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'', a historical novel composed by [[Luo Guanzhong]] in the 14th century (11 centuries after Cao Cao's death), was a romanticisation of the events that occurred in the late [[Han dynasty]] and the [[Three Kingdoms]] period. While adhering to historical facts most of the time, the novel inevitably reshaped Cao Cao to some extent, so as to portray him as a cruel and suspicious villain.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} In some chapters, Luo created fictional or semi-fictional events involving Cao Cao.

===Agriculture and education===
While waging military campaigns against his enemies, Cao Cao did not forget the basis of society&nbsp;– agriculture and education.

In 194, a locust plague caused a major famine across China. The people resorted to cannibalism out of desperation. Without food, many armies were defeated without fighting. From this experience, Cao Cao saw the importance of an ample food supply in building a strong military. He began a series of agricultural programs in cities such as Xu City and Chenliu. Refugees were recruited and given wasteland to cultivate. Later, encampments not faced with imminent danger of war were also made to farm. This system was continued and spread to all regions under Cao Cao as his realm expanded. Although Cao Cao's primary intention was to build a powerful army, the agricultural program also improved the living standards of the people, especially war refugees.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

By 203, Cao Cao had eliminated most of [[Yuan Shao]]'s forces. This afforded him more attention on construction within his realm. In autumn of that year, Cao Cao passed an order decreeing the promotion of education throughout the counties and cities within his jurisdiction. An official in charge of education was assigned to each county with more than 500 households. Youngsters with potential and talent were selected for schooling. This prevented a lapse in the training of intellectuals in those years of war, and, in Cao Cao's words, would benefit the people.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Poetry===
[[File:Long Corridor-曹操赋诗.JPG|thumb|300px|Cao Cao cites a poem before the [[Battle of Red Cliffs]], portrait at the [[Long Corridor]] of the [[Summer Palace]], Beijing]]
{{main|Poetry of Cao Cao}}

Cao Cao was an accomplished poet, as were his sons [[Cao Pi]] and [[Cao Zhi]]. He was also a patron of poets such as [[Xu Gan]].<ref>Davis, p. vi</ref> Of Cao Cao's works, only a remnant remain today. His verses, unpretentious yet profound, helped to reshape the poetic style of his time and beyond, eventually contributing to the poetry styles associated with [[Tang poetry|Tang dynasty poetry]]. Cao Cao, Cao Pi and Cao Zhi are known collectively as the "Three Caos". The Three Caos' poetry, together with additional poets, became known as the [[Jian'an poetry|''Jian'an'' style]], which contributed eventually to Tang and later poetry. Cao Cao also wrote verse in the older four-character per line style characteristic of the ''[[Classic of Poetry]]''. [[Burton Watson]] describes Cao Cao as: "the only writer of the period who succeeded in infusing the old four-character metre with any vitality, mainly because he discarded the archaic diction associated with it and employed the ordinary poetic language of his time."<ref>Watson, p. 38</ref> Cao Cao is also known for his early contributions to the [[Shanshui poetry]] genre, with his 4-character-per-line, 14-line poem [http://www.vincentpoon.com/the-sea------.html "View of the Blue Sea" (觀滄海)].<ref>Yip, 130–33</ref>

On 27 December 2009, the Henan Provincial Cultural Heritage Bureau reported the discovery of Cao Cao's tomb in Xigaoxue Village, [[Anyang County]], [[Henan]]. The tomb, covering an area of 740 square metres, was discovered in December 2008 when workers at a nearby kiln were digging for mud to make bricks. Its discovery was not reported and the local authorities knew of it only when they seized a stone tablet carrying the inscription 'King Wu of Wei' — Cao Cao's posthumous title — from grave robbers who claimed to have stolen it from the tomb. Over the following year, archaeologists recovered more than 250 relics from the tomb. The remains of three persons — a man in his 60s, a woman in her 50s and another woman in her 20s — were also unearthed and are believed to be those of Cao Cao, one of his wives, and a servant.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lin|first=Shujuan|title=Tomb of legendary ruler unearthed|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2009-12/28/content_9234640.htm|publisher=China Daily|access-date=20 June 2013|date=28 December 2009}}</ref>

Media reports from 2018 describe the tomb complex as having an outer rammed earth foundation, a [[spirit way]], and structures on the east and south sides. Archaeologists have also noted that the tomb's exterior and perimeter appear to be deliberately left unmarked; there are neither structures above the ground around the tomb nor massive piles of debris in the vicinity. This indirectly confirms historical records that [[Cao Pi]] had ordered the monuments on the surface to be systematically dismantled to honour his father's wishes to be buried in a simple manner in a concealed location, as well as to prevent tomb robbers from finding and looting the tomb.<ref name="Taiwan News">{{cite news|last1=Everington|first1=Keoni|title=Tomb of legendary Chinese general Cao Cao found|url=https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3390636|access-date=27 March 2018|newspaper=Taiwan News|date=26 March 2018}}</ref><ref name="SCMP">{{cite news|last1=Zhou|first1=Laura|title=Archaeologists confident they have found body of fabled Chinese warlord Cao Cao|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2138951/archaeologists-confident-they-have-found-body-fabled-chinese|access-date=27 March 2018|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=26 March 2018}}</ref><ref name="Apple Daily">{{cite news|title=梟雄出土 河南考古找到曹操遺骸 [A ''xiaoxiong'' is unearthed; Henan archaeologists discover Cao Cao's remains]|url=https://tw.news.appledaily.com/international/realtime/20180325/1321878/|access-date=27 March 2018|newspaper=Apple Daily|date=25 March 2018|language=zh}}</ref><ref name="Mirage News">{{cite news|title=Archaeologists claim to have found body of China's Cao Cao|url=https://www.miragenews.com/archaeologists-claim-to-have-have-found-body-of-china-s-cao-cao/|access-date=27 March 2018|agency=Mirage News|date=27 March 2018}}{{dead link|date=April 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

Cao Cao was a purported descendant of the [[Western Han dynasty]] chancellor [[Cao Shen]]. In the early 2010s, researchers from [[Fudan University]] compared the Y chromosomes collected from a tooth from Cao Cao's granduncle, Cao Ding ({{lang|zh|曹鼎}}), with those of Cao Shen and found them to be significantly different. Therefore, the claim about Cao Cao descending from Cao Shen was not supported by genetic evidence.<ref>Wang CC, Yan S, Hou Z, Fu W, Xiong M, Han S, Jin L, Li H. Present Y chromosomes reveal the ancestry of Emperor CAO Cao of 1800 years ago. J Hum Genet. 2012, 57(3):216–18.</ref> The researchers also found that the Y chromosomes of Cao Ding match those of self-proclaimed living descendants of Cao Cao who hold lineage records dating back to more than 100 generations ago.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Chuan-Chao Wang|author2=Shi Yan|author3=Can Yao|author4=Xiu-Yuan Huang|author5=Xue Ao|author6=Zhanfeng Wang|author7=Sheng Han|author8=Li Jin|author9=Hui Li|date=14 February 2013|title=Ancient DNA of Emperor CAO Cao's granduncle matches those of his present descendants: a commentary on present Y chromosomes reveal the ancestry of Emperor CAO Cao of 1800 years ago|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235620438|journal=Journal of Human Genetics|publisher=The Japan Society of Human Genetics|volume=58|issue=4|pages=238–39|doi=10.1038/jhg.2013.5|pmid=23407348|archive-url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322235401|archive-date=2020|access-date=3 May 2016|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Zhu Ziyan, a history professor from [[Shanghai University]], felt that Cao Ding's tooth alone cannot be used as evidence to determine Cao Cao's ancestry. He was sceptical about whether those who claim to be Cao Cao's descendants are really so, because genealogical records dating from the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279) are already so rare in the present day, much less those dating from the [[Three Kingdoms]] era (220–280). Besides, according to historical records, Cao Ding was a younger brother of the eunuch [[Cao Teng]], who adopted Cao Cao's biological father, [[Cao Song]]. Therefore, Cao Cao had no known blood relations with Cao Ding. In other words, Cao Ding was not Cao Cao's real granduncle (this assuming that there was no intra-family adoption, which was actually common in China). Zhu Ziyan mentioned that Fudan University's research only proves that those self-proclaimed descendants of Cao Cao are related to Cao Ding; it does not directly relate them to Cao Cao.<ref>{{cite web|date=11 December 2013|title=上海學者商榷復旦曹操DNA研究：僅憑曹鼎牙齒難揭身世 [Scholars from Shanghai (University) discuss Fudan (University)'s research on Cao Cao's DNA: A tooth from Cao Ding is insufficient to determine (Cao Cao's) ancestry]|url=http://dailynews.sina.com/bg/chn/chnpolitics/phoenixtv/20131211/02105257954.html|access-date=30 August 2014|website=Sina News|language=zh}}</ref>
