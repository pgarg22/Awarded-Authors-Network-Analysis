'''Maya Angelou''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Maya Angelou.ogg|ˈ|æ|n|dʒ|ə|l|oʊ}} {{Respell|AN|jə|loh}};<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.swisseduc.ch/english/readinglist/angelou_maya/pronun.html|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131217043543/http://www.swisseduc.ch/english/readinglist/angelou_maya/pronun.html|archive-date = December 17, 2013|title = Maya Angelou|date = December 17, 2013|publisher = SwissEduc.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |title = Dr. Maya Angelou|date = December 2009|last = Glover|first = Terry|magazine = Ebony|issue = 2|page = 67|volume = 65}}</ref> born '''Marguerite Annie Johnson'''; April 4, 1928&nbsp;– May 28, 2014) was an American poet, memoirist, and [[civil rights activist]]. She published seven autobiographies, three books of essays, several books of poetry, and is credited with a list of plays, movies, and television shows spanning over 50 years. She received dozens of awards and more than 50 honorary degrees.<ref name="whosehonor" /> Angelou is best known for her series of seven autobiographies, which focus on her childhood and early adult experiences. The first, ''[[I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings]]'' (1969), tells of her life up to the age of 17 and brought her international recognition and acclaim.

She became a poet and writer after a string of odd jobs during her young adulthood. These included fry cook, [[sex worker]], nightclub performer, ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' cast member, [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] coordinator, and correspondent in [[Egypt]] and [[Ghana]] during the [[Decolonisation of Africa|decolonization of Africa]]. She was also an actress, writer, director, and producer of plays, movies, and public television programs. In 1982, she was named the first Reynolds Professor of American Studies at [[Wake Forest University]] in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]], North Carolina. She was active in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and worked with [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and [[Malcolm X]]. Beginning in the 1990s, she made approximately 80 appearances a year on the [[lecture circuit]], something she continued into her eighties. In 1993, Angelou recited her poem "[[On the Pulse of Morning]]" (1993) at the [[first inauguration of Bill Clinton]], making her the first poet to make an inaugural recitation since [[Robert Frost]] at the [[inauguration of John F. Kennedy]] in 1961.

With the publication of ''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings'', Angelou publicly discussed aspects of her personal life. She was respected as a spokesperson for Black people and women, and her works have been considered a defense of Black culture. Her works are widely used in schools and universities worldwide, although attempts have been made to ban her books from some US libraries. Angelou's most celebrated works have been labeled as [[Biography in literature#Autobiographical fiction|autobiographical fiction]], but many critics consider them to be autobiographies. She made a deliberate attempt to challenge the common structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing and expanding the genre. Her books center on themes including [[Racism in the United States|racism]], identity, family and travel.

Four years later, when Angelou was seven and her brother eight, the children's father "came to Stamps without warning"<ref>Angelou (1969), p. 52.</ref> and returned them to their mother's care in St. Louis. At the age of eight, while living with her mother, Angelou was sexually abused and raped by her mother's boyfriend, a man named Freeman. She told her brother, who told the rest of their family.

==Career==
=== Adulthood and early career: 1951–61 ===

After Angelou's marriage ended in 1954, she danced professionally in clubs around San Francisco, including the nightclub [[The Purple Onion]], where she sang and danced to [[calypso music]].<ref>Gillespie et al., p. 38.</ref> Up to that point, she went by the name of "Marguerite Johnson", or "Rita", but at the strong suggestion of her managers and supporters at The Purple Onion, she changed her professional name to "Maya Angelou" (her nickname and former married surname). It was a "distinctive name"<ref>Gillespie et al., p. 41.</ref> that set her apart and captured the feel of her [[Calypso music|calypso]] dance performances. During 1954 and 1955, Angelou toured Europe with a production of the opera ''[[Porgy and Bess]]''. She began her practice of learning the language of every country she visited, and in a few years she gained proficiency in several languages.<ref>Hagen, pp. 91–92.</ref> In 1957, riding on the popularity of calypso, Angelou recorded her first album, ''[[Miss Calypso]]'', which was reissued as a CD in 1996.<ref name="angelou-95" /><ref name="calypso">{{cite web|url = http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/290605%7C0/Calypso-Heat-Wave.html|title = Calypso Heat Wave|access-date = December 18, 2013|website = Turner Classic Movies|last = Miller|first = John M.}}</ref><ref>Gillespie et al., p. 48.</ref> She appeared in an off-Broadway review that inspired the 1957 film ''[[Calypso Heat Wave]]'', in which Angelou sang and performed her own compositions.<ref name="calypso" />{{refn|Reviewer John M.

The details of Angelou's life described in her seven autobiographies and in numerous interviews, speeches, and articles tended to be inconsistent. Critic Mary Jane Lupton has explained that when Angelou spoke about her life, she did so eloquently but informally and "with no time chart in front of her".<ref>Lupton, p. 2.</ref> For example, she was married at least twice, but never clarified the number of times she had been married, "for fear of sounding frivolous";<ref name="younge1" /> according to her autobiographies and to Gillespie, she married Tosh Angelos in 1951 and [[Paul du Feu]] in 1974, and began her relationship with Vusumzi Make in 1961, but never formally married him. Angelou held many jobs, including some in the [[sex trade]], working as a [[prostitute]] and [[Procuring (prostitution)|madam]] for lesbians, as she described in her second autobiography, ''[[Gather Together in My Name]]''. In a 1995 interview, Angelou said, {{Quote|I wrote about my experiences because I thought too many people tell young folks, 'I never did anything wrong. Who, Moi? – never I. I have no skeletons in my closet. In fact, I have no closet.' They lie like that and then young people find themselves in situations and they think, 'Damn I must be a pretty bad guy.

[[File:Angelou Obama.jpg|thumb|right|US President [[Barack Obama]] presenting Angelou with the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], 2011]]
When ''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings'' was published in 1969, Angelou was hailed as a new kind of memoirist, one of the first African-American women who were able to publicly discuss their personal lives. According to scholar Hilton Als, up to that point, Black female writers were marginalized to the point that they were unable to present themselves as central characters in the literature they wrote.<ref name="als" /> Linguist [[John McWhorter]] agreed, seeing Angelou's works, which he called "tracts", as "apologetic writing". He placed Angelou in the tradition of African-American literature as a defense of Black culture, which he called "a literary manifestation of the imperative that reigned in the black scholarship of the period".<ref name="mcwhorter-40">McWhorter, p. 40.</ref> Writer Julian Mayfield, who called ''Caged Bird'' "a work of art that eludes description",<ref name="als" /> argued that Angelou's autobiographies set a precedent for not only other Black women writers, but also African-American autobiography as a whole. Als said that ''Caged Bird'' marked one of the first times that a Black autobiographer could, as he put it, "write about blackness from the inside, without apology or defense".<ref name="als" /> Through the writing of her autobiography, Angelou became recognized and highly respected as a spokesperson for Blacks and women.<ref name="braxton-4">Braxton, p. 4.</ref> It made her "without a doubt,&nbsp;... America's most visible black woman autobiographer",<ref name="braxton-4" /> and "a major autobiographical voice of the time".<ref>Long, p. 85.</ref> As writer Gary Younge said, "Probably more than almost any other writer alive, Angelou's life literally is her work."<ref name="younge1" />

Als said that ''Caged Bird'' helped increase Black [[feminist]] writings in the 1970s, less through its originality than "its resonance in the prevailing [[Zeitgeist]]",<ref name="als" /> or the time in which it was written, at the end of the American [[Civil Rights Movement]]. Als also claimed that Angelou's writings, more interested in self-revelation than in politics or feminism, have freed other female writers to "open themselves up without shame to the eyes of the world".<ref name="als" /> Angelou critic [[Joanne M. Braxton]] stated that ''Caged Bird'' was "perhaps the most aesthetically pleasing" autobiography written by an African-American woman in its era.<ref name="braxton-4" /> Angelou's poetry has influenced the modern [[hip-hop music]] community, including artists such as [[Kanye West]], [[Common (rapper)|Common]], [[Tupac Shakur]], and [[Nicki Minaj]].<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://time.com/125901/maya-angelou-rap-hip-hop/|title = A Brief History of How Maya Angelou Influenced Hip Hop|last=Feeney|first=Nolan|date =May 28, 2014|work= Time Magazine|access-date=November 14, 2014}}</ref>

=== Critical reception ===
Reviewer [[Elsie B. Washington]] called Angelou "the black woman's poet laureate".<ref name="washington">{{Cite journal|title = A Song Flung Up to Heaven|date= March–April 2002|last = Washington|first = Elsie B.|journal = Black Issues Book Review|issue = 2|volume = 4|page = 56 |url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/A+Song+Flung+Up+to+Heaven.+(nonfiction+reviews)-a083553083}}</ref> Sales of the paperback version of her books and poetry rose by 300–600% the week after Angelou's recitation. [[Random House]], which published the poem later that year, had to reprint 400,000 copies of all her books to keep up with the demand. They sold more of her books in January 1993 than they did in all of 1992, accounting for a 1200% increase.<ref>{{Cite news|title = Chronicle|date =January 30, 1993|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/30/style/chronicle-575993.html|last = Brozan|first=Nadine|work = The New York Times|access-date=December 21, 2013}}</ref> Angelou famously said, in response to criticism regarding using the details of her life in her work, "I agree with [[Balzac]] and 19th-century writers, black and white, who say, 'I write for money'."<ref name="younge1" /> Younge, speaking after the publication of Angelou's third book of essays, ''[[Letter to My Daughter]]'' (2008), has said, "For the last couple of decades she has merged her various talents into a kind of performance art—issuing a message of personal and social uplift by blending poetry, song and conversation."<ref name="younge2" />

Angelou's books, especially ''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings'', have been criticized by many parents, causing their removal from school curricula and library shelves. According to the [[National Coalition Against Censorship]], some parents and some schools have objected to ''Caged Bird''{{'}}s depictions of lesbianism, premarital cohabitation, pornography, and violence.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.thefileroom.org/documents/dyn/DisplayCase.cfm/id/796|title = Maya Angelou, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings|access-date = December 21, 2013 |publisher = National Coalition Against Censorship}}</ref> Some have been critical of the book's sexually explicit scenes, use of language, and irreverent depictions of religion.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Banned in the USA: A Reference Guide to Book Censorship in Schools and Public Libraries|last = Foerstel|first = Herbert N. |publisher = Information Age Publishing|year = 2006|isbn = 978-1-59311-374-2|location = Westport, Connecticut|pages = 195–6}}</ref> ''Caged Bird'' appeared third on the [[American Library Association]] (ALA) list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990–2000 and sixth on the ALA's 2000–2009 list.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.ala.org/bbooks/100-most-frequently-challenged-books-1990%E2%80%931999|title = The 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990–2000|access-date = December 21, 2013 |publisher = American Library Association|date = March 27, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.ala.org/bbooks/top-100-bannedchallenged-books-2000-2009|title = Top 100 Banned/Challenged Books: 2000–2009|access-date = December 21, 2013|publisher = American Library Association|date = March 27, 2013}}</ref>

=== Uses in education ===
Angelou's autobiographies have been used in [[narrative]] and multicultural approaches in [[teacher education]]. Jocelyn A. Glazier, a professor at [[George Washington University]], has trained teachers how to "talk about race" in their classrooms with ''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings'' and ''Gather Together in My Name''. According to Glazier, Angelou's use of understatement, self-mockery, humor, and irony have left readers of Angelou's autobiographies unsure of what she left out and how they should respond to the events she described. Angelou's depictions of her experiences of racism have forced white readers to either explore their feelings about race and their own "privileged status", or to avoid the discussion as a means of keeping their privilege. Glazier found that critics have focused on the way Angelou fits within the genre of African-American autobiography and on her [[literary techniques]], but readers have tended to react to her storytelling with "surprise, particularly when [they] enter the text with certain expectations about the genre of autobiography".<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Moving Closer to Speaking the Unspeakable: White Teachers Talking about Race|date=Winter 2003|url = http://www.calfac.org/allpdf/teqwinter2003/glazier.pdf|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20050401042033/http://www.calfac.org/allpdf/teqwinter2003/glazier.pdf|archive-date=April 1, 2005|last= Glazier|first= Jocelyn A.|journal = Teacher Education Quarterly|access-date =December 21, 2013|volume = 30|issue = 1|pages = 73–94}}</ref>

Educator Daniel Challener, in his 1997 book ''Stories of Resilience in Childhood'', analyzed the events in ''Caged Bird'' to illustrate resiliency in children. He argued that Angelou's book has provided a "useful framework" for exploring the obstacles many children like Maya have faced and how their communities have helped them succeed.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Stories of Resilience in Childhood|last = Challener|first = Daniel D.|publisher = Taylor & Francis|year =1997 |isbn = 978-0-8153-2800-1|location = London, England|pages = 22–3}}</ref> Psychologist Chris Boyatzis has reported using ''Caged Bird'' to supplement scientific theory and research in the instruction of [[child development]] topics such as the development of self-concept and self-esteem, ego resilience, industry versus inferiority, effects of abuse, parenting styles, sibling and friendship relations, gender issues, cognitive development, puberty, and identity formation in adolescence. He found ''Caged Bird'' a "highly effective" tool for providing real-life examples of these psychological concepts.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Let the Caged Bird Sing: Using Literature to Teach Developmental Psychology|date=February 1992|last=Boyatzis|first=Chris J.|journal=Teaching of Psychology|volume=19|issue= 4|pages = 221–2|doi = 10.1207/s15328023top1904_5|citeseerx=10.1.1.1030.5582|s2cid=145274568}}</ref>

== Poetry ==
{{Main|Poetry of Maya Angelou}}

Angelou is best known for her seven autobiographies, but she was also a prolific and successful poet. She was called "the black woman's poet laureate", and her poems have been called the anthems of African Americans.<ref name="washington" /> Angelou studied and began writing poetry at a young age, and used poetry and other great literature to cope with her rape as a young girl, as described in ''Caged Bird''.<ref name="angelou-13" /> According to scholar Yasmin Y. DeGout, literature also affected Angelou's sensibilities as the poet and writer she became, especially the "liberating discourse that would evolve in her own poetic canon".<ref name=":24">DeGout, p. 122.</ref>

Many critics consider Angelou's autobiographies more important than her poetry.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Dictionary of Literary Biography African American Writers after 1955|last = Bloom|first = Lynn Z.|publisher = Gale Research Company|year = 1985|isbn = 978-0-8103-1716-1|location = Detroit, Michigan|pages = [https://archive.org/details/afroamericanwrit0038unse/page/10 10–11]|volume = 38|chapter = Maya Angelou|chapter-url = https://archive.org/details/afroamericanwrit0038unse/page/10}}</ref> Although all her books have been best-sellers, her poetry has not been perceived to be as serious as her prose and has been understudied.<ref name="lupton-4" /> Her poems were more interesting when she recited and performed them, and many critics emphasized the public aspect of her poetry.<ref>Burr, p. 181.</ref> Angelou's lack of critical acclaim has been attributed to both the public nature of many of her poems and to Angelou's popular success, and to critics' preferences for poetry as a written form rather than a verbal, performed one.<ref name=":23">{{Cite book|title = Maya Angelou|last = Bloom|first = Harold|publisher = Chelsea House Publishers|year = 2001|isbn = 978-0-7910-5937-1|location = Broomall, Pennsylvania|page = [https://archive.org/details/mayaangeloubloom00haro/page/9 9]|url = https://archive.org/details/mayaangeloubloom00haro/page/9}}</ref> Zofia Burr has countered Angelou's critics by condemning them for not taking into account Angelou's larger purposes in her writing: "to be representative rather than individual, authoritative rather than confessional".<ref>Burr, p. 183.</ref>

== Style and genre in autobiographies ==
{{Main|Themes in Maya Angelou's autobiographies}}
Angelou's use of fiction-writing techniques such as dialogue, characterization, and development of theme, setting, plot, and language has often resulted in the placement of her books into the genre of [[autobiographical fiction]].<ref>Lupton, pp. 29–30.</ref> Angelou made a deliberate attempt in her books to challenge the common structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre.<ref>Lauret, p. 98.</ref> Scholar Mary Jane Lupton argues that all of Angelou's autobiographies conform to the genre's standard structure: they are written by a single author, they are chronological, and they contain elements of character, technique, and theme.<ref>Lupton, p. 32.</ref> Angelou recognizes that there are fictional aspects to her books; Lupton agrees, stating that Angelou tended to "diverge from the conventional notion of autobiography as truth",<ref name="lupton-34">Lupton, p. 34.</ref> which parallels the conventions of much of African-American autobiography written during the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] period of US history, when as both Lupton and African-American scholar Crispin Sartwell put it, the truth was censored out of the need for self-protection.<ref name="lupton-34" /><ref>{{Cite book|title = Act Like You Know: African-American Autobiography and White Identity|last = Sartwell|first = Crispin|publisher = University of Chicago Press|year = 1998|isbn = 978-0-226-73527-6|location = Chicago|page = [https://archive.org/details/actlikeyouknowaf0000sart/page/26 26]|url = https://archive.org/details/actlikeyouknowaf0000sart/page/26}}</ref> Scholar Lyman B.

According to African-American literature scholar Pierre A. Walker, the challenge for much of the history of African-American literature was that its authors have had to confirm its status as literature before they could accomplish their political goals, which was why Angelou's editor [[Robert Loomis]] was able to dare her into writing ''Caged Bird'' by challenging her to write an autobiography that could be considered "high art".<ref name=":17">Walker, p. 92.</ref> Angelou acknowledged that she followed the slave narrative tradition of "speaking in the first-person singular talking about the first-person plural, always saying I meaning 'we'".<ref name="poetry" /> Scholar John McWhorter calls Angelou's books "tracts"<ref name="mcwhorter-40" /> that defend African-American culture and fight negative stereotypes. According to McWhorter, Angelou structured her books, which to him seem to be written more for children than for adults, to support her defense of Black culture. McWhorter sees Angelou as she depicts herself in her autobiographies "as a kind of stand-in figure for the Black American in Troubled Times".<ref name="mcwhorter-40" /> McWhorter views Angelou's works as dated, but recognizes that "she has helped to pave the way for contemporary black writers who are able to enjoy the luxury of being merely individuals, no longer representatives of the race, only themselves".<ref>McWhorter, p. 41.</ref> Scholar Lynn Z. Bloom compares Angelou's works to the writings of [[Frederick Douglass]], stating that both fulfilled the same purpose: to describe Black culture and to interpret it for their wider, white audiences.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Racism in Maya Angelou's I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings|last = Bloom|first = Lynn Z.|publisher = Gale Press|year = 2008|isbn = 978-0-7377-3905-3|location = Detroit, Michigan|page = 17|editor-last = Johnson|editor-first = Claudia|chapter = The Life of Maya Angelou}}</ref>

According to scholar Sondra O'Neale, Angelou's poetry can be placed within the African-American oral tradition, and her prose "follows classic technique in nonpoetic Western forms".<ref>O'Neale, p. 32.</ref> O'Neale states that Angelou avoided using a "monolithic Black language",<ref name="oneale-34">O'Neale, p. 34.</ref> and accomplished, through direct dialogue, what O'Neale calls a "more expected ghetto expressiveness".<ref name="oneale-34" /> McWhorter finds both the language Angelou used in her autobiographies and the people she depicted unrealistic, resulting in a separation between her and her audience. As McWhorter states, "I have never read autobiographical writing where I had such a hard time summoning a sense of how the subject talks, or a sense of who the subject really is".<ref>McWhorter, p. 39.</ref> McWhorter asserts, for example, that key figures in Angelou's books, like herself, her son Guy, and mother Vivian do not speak as one would expect, and that their speech is "cleaned up" for her readers.<ref>McWhorter, p. 38.</ref> Guy, for example, represents the young Black male, while Vivian represents the idealized mother figure, and the stiff language they use, as well as the language in Angelou's text, is intended to prove that Blacks can use standard English competently.<ref>McWhorter, pp. 40–41.</ref>

McWhorter recognizes that much of the reason for Angelou's style was the "apologetic" nature of her writing.<ref name="mcwhorter-40" /> When Angelou wrote ''Caged Bird'' at the end of the 1960s, one of the necessary and accepted features of literature at the time was "organic unity", and one of her goals was to create a book that satisfied that criterion.<ref name=":17" /> The events in her books were episodic and crafted like a series of short stories, but their arrangements did not follow a strict chronology. Instead, they were placed to emphasize the [[Themes in Maya Angelou's autobiographies|themes of her books]], which include racism, identity, family, and travel. English literature scholar Valerie Sayers has asserted that "Angelou's poetry and prose are similar". They both rely on her "direct voice", which alternates steady rhythms with [[syncopated]] patterns and uses similes and metaphors (e.g., the caged bird).<ref>{{Cite news|title = Songs of Herself|date =September 28, 2008|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/09/26/ST2008092601489.html|last = Sayers|first = Valerie|work = [[The Washington Post]]|access-date =December 22, 2013}}</ref> According to Hagen, Angelou's works were influenced by both conventional literary and the oral traditions of the African-American community. For example, she referenced more than 100 literary characters throughout her books and poetry.<ref>Hagen, p. 63.</ref> In addition, she used the elements of [[blues music]], including the act of testimony when speaking of one's life and struggles, ironic understatement, and the use of natural metaphors, rhythms, and intonations.<ref>Hagen, p. 61.</ref> Angelou, instead of depending upon plot, used personal and historical events to shape her books.<ref>Lupton, p. 142.</ref>
