He is best known for his book-length [[narrative poem]] of the [[American Civil War]], ''[[John Brown's Body (poem)|John Brown's Body]]'' (1928), for which he received the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]], and for the short stories "[[The Devil and Daniel Webster (short story)|The Devil and Daniel Webster]]" (1936) and "[[By the Waters of Babylon]]" (1937).

| quote = <poem>
Out of John Brown's strong sinews the tall skyscrapers grow,
Out of his heart the chanting buildings rise,
Rivet and girder, motor and dynamo,
Pillar of smoke by day and fire by night,
The steel-faced cities reaching at the skies,
The whole enormous and rotating cage
Hung with hard jewels of electric light,
Smoky with sorrow, black with splendor, dyed
Whiter than damask for a crystal bride
With metal suns, the engine-handed Age,
The genie we have raised to rule the earth,
Obsequious to our will
But servant-master still,
The tireless serf already half a god --

Benét won the [[O. Henry Award]] on three occasions, for his short stories ''An End to Dreams'' in 1932, ''[[The Devil and Daniel Webster]]'' in 1937, and ''Freedom's a Hard-Bought Thing'' in 1940. 

His fantasy short story "[[The Devil and Daniel Webster]]" inspired several unauthorized dramatizations by other writers after its initial publication which prompted Benet to adapt his own work for the stage.<ref name="MLA">{{cite book|url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Douglas_Moore/soYHkRcq0r4C?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22The+Devil+and+Daniel+Webster%22+%22Douglas+Moore%22&pg=PA420&printsec=frontcover|title=Douglas Moore: A Bio-bibliography|first=Jerry L.|last=McBride|year=2011|pages=24–28|isbn=9780895796660|publisher=[[Music Library Association]]}}</ref> Benet approached composer [[Douglas Moore]] to create an opera of the work with Benet serving as librettist in 1937.<ref name="MLA"/> ''[[The Devil and Daniel Webster (opera)|The Devil and Daniel Webster: An Opera in One Act]]'' (New York: Farrar & Rinehart, 1939) premiered on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1939.<ref name="MLA"/> That work was created from 1937 through 1939, and its libretto served as the basis for a 1938 play adaptation of the work by Benet (''The Devil and Daniel Webster: A Play in One Act'', New York: Dramatists Play Service, 1938).<ref name="MLA"/>  The play in turn was used as the source for a screenplay adaptation co-penned by Benet which was originally released as ''[[The Devil and Daniel Webster (film)|All That Money Can Buy]]'' (1941).<ref name="MLA"/> 

Benét also wrote the sequel "Daniel Webster and the Sea Serpent", in which Daniel Webster encounters [[Leviathan]].
