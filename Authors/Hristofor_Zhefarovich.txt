== Biography ==
Born at the end of the 17th century, Hristofor Žefarović (Old Cyrillic: Христофоръ Жефаровичъ) descended from a priestly family from [[Dojran]] in [[Ottoman Empire]], (present-day [[North Macedonia]]) and became a monk himself. As a highly educated and well-learned itinerant monk, he painted and traded with books, icons, and church plate. He spent some time in the [[Sveti Naum|St. Naum Monastery]] in [[Ohrid]]. His name was first mentioned in 1734 in [[Belgrade]], where he was well known as an artist. His first well-preserved work are the frescoes in the churches of the [[Bođani Monastery]] in [[Bačka]], then [[Habsburg Monarchy]] (today in [[Serbia]]) from 1737 and the [[Siklós]] Orthodox Monastery from 1739.<ref name="Jugoslovenski književni leksikon">{{cite book |author= Lazar Čurčić |editor = Živan Milisavac |date=1971 |title=Jugoslovenski književni leksikon |trans-title=Yugoslav Literary Lexicon |publisher=[[Matica srpska]] |language=sh |location= [[Novi Sad]] ([[Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina|SAP Vojvodina]], [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|SR Serbia]]) |page=592 }}</ref> He was exclusively engaged in copper engraving and book illustration after 1740. he engraved copper plates for his books, and printed them in the "etching-typographical workshop" of his collaborator Thomas Mesmer in [[Vienna]]. His engraving was of great cultural-historical importance to the Baroque art of the time. His style of 'bright cut' engraving was thoroughly masterly and original, specializing in the higher branches—engraving for printing—of the engraver's art.

Žefarović made a [[pilgrimage]] to [[Jerusalem]] through [[Thessaloniki]] and [[Jaffa]] and later established himself in the [[Epiphany Monastery]] in [[Moscow]], where he died on 18 September 1753. He was responsible for making the writing genre called ''[[proskynetaria]]'' popular with descriptions of the holy places and monasteries of Palestine and elsewhere, often giving prayers and devotions associated with each place. Žefarović was the author of two religious works, an instruction to newly appointed priests (Поучение святителское к новопоставленному йерею, ''Pouchenie svyatitelskoe k novopostavlennomu yereyu'') from 1742 and a description of Jerusalem from 1748 (Описание светаго божия града Йерусалима, ''Opisanie svetago bozhiya grada Ierusalima''), the travel book was published by Jerusalem [[Archimandrite]] Simeon Simonović at his own expense. Žefarović's name is also associated with two textbooks — a primer and a grammar book, as well as numerous copper gravures of renowned personalities from modern-day Vojvodina.

His work was acknowledged in [[Europe]] and he became an honorary member of the Imperial Academy in Vienna and the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich|Royal Academy of Munich]].

He died in [[Moscow]] on 18 September 1753.

== ''Stemmatographia'' ==
Žefarović's work of greatest importance for the South Slavic Revival was his ''[[Stemmatografia#Hristofor_Žefarović_edition|Stemmatographia]]'' published in [[Vienna]] in 1741. The book was commissioned by the [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]] [[Metropolitanate of Karlovci|Metropolitan of Karlovci]], [[Arsenije IV Jovanović Šakabenta]], who also funded its production.<ref>{{Citation| last=Mihaljčić| first=Rade| author-link=Rade Mihaljčić| year=2001| orig-year=1984| script-title=sr:Лазар Хребељановић: историја, култ, предање| publisher=Srpska školska knjiga; Knowledge| place=Belgrade| language=sr| isbn=86-83565-01-7| pages=228–29| mode=cs1}}</ref> During its composition Žefarović used the ''Stemmatographia'' of [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Croatian]] [[Pavao Ritter Vitezović]] of 1701, who on his part used ''Kingdom of the Slavs'' by [[Mauro Orbini]] of 1601. ''Stemmatographia'' was illustrated by Žefarović with [[copperplate engraving]]s and black and white drawings. It contains 20 copperplates depicting 28 [[Serbia]]n and [[Bulgaria]]n rulers and saints; 15 of them are Serbian princes, princesses, kings, and tsars (mostly of the [[Nemanjić dynasty]]), and 7 of them are Serbian archbishops and patriarchs.<ref>{{Citation| last1=Žefarović| first1=Hristofor| last2=Mesmer| first2=Toma| editor=Dinko Davidov| year=1972| orig-year=1741| title=Stemmatographia| publisher=[[Gallery of Matica Srpska]]| place=Novi Sad| language=cu| url=http://www.kroraina.com/knigi/hzh/gal/index.html| mode=cs1}}</ref> ''Stemmatographia'' also contains 56 [[coats of arms]] of [[South Slavs#Peoples and countries|South Slavic]] and other [[Balkans|Balkan]] countries with descriptive [[quatrain]]s under them, regarded as the first example of modern secular [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Serbian poetry]]. ''Stemmatographia'' had a crucial influence on the [[Bulgarian National Revival]] and made a great impact on the entire Bulgarian [[heraldry]] of the 19th century, when it became most influential among all generations of Bulgarian enlighteners and revolutionaries during the period of [[national awakening of Bulgaria]] and shaped the idea for a modern Bulgarian national symbol.

The pattern of [[Coat of arms of Bulgaria|Bulgarian coat of arms]] of ''Stemmatographia'' was used as the state symbol of the royal Bulgarian administration in 1878, but set in an [[Ermine (heraldry)|ermine]] mantle and with a prince's crown above it. This coat of arms continued to be used on the state [[seal (emblem)|seal]] and the seals of state institutions well after an official one (also influenced by the one in ''Stemmatographia'') was introduced by the [[National Assembly of Bulgaria|National Assembly]]. The coat of arms of the short-lived [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] province of [[Eastern Rumelia]] was also created after the coat of arms of [[Constantinople]] (called "coat of arms of [[Romania]]") in Žefarović's work.

Žefarović's coat of arms of [[Bulgaria]] is depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the Bulgarian 2 [[Bulgarian lev|levs]] banknote, issued in 1999 and 2005.<ref>[http://www.bnb.bg Bulgarian National Bank].

== Nationality and ethnicity ==
Hristofor Žefarović worked for the spiritual resurgence of the [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] and [[Serbs|Serbian]] [[people]], as he considered them to be one and the same "[[Illyrian movement|Illyrian]]" ([[South Slavs|South Slavic]]) people. [[Pavle Nenadović]], [[exarch]] of the Serbian Patriarch, had called him "Illyro-Rascian universal painter, zealot of the Bulgarian homeland and kinlover of the Illyrian Empire" ("иллирïко рассïанскому общему зографу, ревнителю отчества Болгарскагѡ и любителю царства Иллѵрïческагѡ"). Žefarović noted "our Serbian motherland" ("отечество сербско наше", ''otechestvo serbsko nashe'') and signed as a "Illyro-Rascian universal painter" ("иллирïко рассïанскïи общïй зографъ", ''illirïko rassïanskïy obshtïy zograf''). In his testament, he explicitly noted that his relatives were "of Bulgarian nationality" ("булгарской нации", ''bulgarskoy natsii'') and from [[Dojran]].<ref>„булгарской нации... въ православной архiепископiи Салонской въ городѣ Догрiанѣ братъ родной свящтеникъ и протчiя сродники“.</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=hOx2dnr3NFMC&pg=PA30&lpg=PA30&dq=Hristofor+Zhefarovich&source=bl&ots=1gFFpCZkY5&sig=KhKbTjjon5Ftx0cm9d-mk6zpc58&hl=bg&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result Bulgaria, R.

Western scholars prefer to emphasize his contributions to the history of both peoples, and maintain that Žefarović belonged to both [[nation]]s.<ref name="hughes">{{cite book|last=Hughes|first=Henry Stuart|title=Teachers of history: essays in honor of [[Laurence B.
