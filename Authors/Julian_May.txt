'''Julian Clare May''' (July 10, 1931 – October 17, 2017) was an American [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]], [[Horror fiction|horror]], [[science]] and [[children's]] writer who also used several literary pseudonyms. She was best known for her ''[[Saga of Pliocene Exile]]'' (''Saga of the Exiles'' in the United Kingdom) and ''[[Galactic Milieu Series]]'' books.

== Background and early career ==
Julian May grew up in [[Elmwood Park, Illinois]], a suburb of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], the oldest of four children.  Her parents were Matthew M. May (originally Majewski) and Julia Feilen May; as a child she was known as Judy May.  She became involved in [[science fiction fandom]] in her late teens, publishing the [[fanzine]] ''Interim Newsletter'' for a time.  She sold her first professional fiction, a [[short story]] called "Dune Roller", in 1950 to [[John W. Campbell]]'s [[Astounding (magazine)|''Astounding Science Fiction'']]; it appeared in 1951, under the name "J. C. May", accompanied by her original illustrations.  She met her future husband, [[T. E. Dikty|Ted Dikty]], later that year at a convention in Ohio.  May chaired the [[Tenth World Science Fiction Convention]] in Chicago in 1952, becoming the first woman to chair a worldcon, and married Dikty in January, 1953.  After selling one more short story, "Star of Wonder" (to [[Thrilling Wonder Stories]] in 1953), she dropped out of the science fiction field for several years.

== Period outside science fiction ==
May and Dikty had three children, the last of whom was born in 1958. Starting in 1954, May wrote thousands of science encyclopedia articles for Consolidated Book Publishers; after finishing that project, she wrote similar articles for two other encyclopedia publishers.  In 1957 she and her husband founded a production and editorial service for small publishers, Publication Associates; the most notable projects May wrote and edited during this period include two episodes of the [[Buck Rogers#Comic strip|''Buck Rogers'' comic strip]] and a new Catholic catechism for Franciscan Herald Press, a publisher associated with the [[Order of Friars Minor]].  Between 1956 and 1981 she wrote more than 250 books for children and young adults, most non-fiction, under her own name and a variety of pseudonyms; the subjects included science, history, and short biographies of modern-day celebrities such as athletes and musical groups.

"Dune Roller" was filmed in 1972 as ''[[The Cremators]]'', in which she was credited as "Judy Dikty".<ref name="IMDB_Cremators">{{cite web

== Return to science fiction ==
Having moved to Oregon in the early 1970s, May began to get reacquainted with the world of fandom; in 1976, she attended [[Westercon]] 29 in Los Angeles, her first science-fiction convention in many years.  She made an elaborate diamond-encrusted "space suit" for the convention's costume party, which started her thinking about what sort of character would wear such a suit.  She soon began accumulating a folder of ideas for what would become the [[Galactic Milieu Series]], and in 1978 she began writing what would become the ''[[Saga of Pliocene Exile]]''.  The first book in that series, ''The Many-Colored Land'', was published in 1981 by [[Houghton Mifflin]].  In 1987, she continued the series with ''Intervention'', finally followed in 1992 (with a change in publisher) by the [[Galactic Milieu Series]]: ''Jack the Bodiless'', ''Diamond Mask'' and ''Magnificat''.

In August 2015, she was inducted into the [[First Fandom Hall of Fame award|First Fandom Hall of Fame]] in a ceremony at the [[73rd World Science Fiction Convention]].
