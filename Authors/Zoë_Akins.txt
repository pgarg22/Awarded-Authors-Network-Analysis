==Biography==

=== Early years ===
[[File:Zoe Akins.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Zoe Akins in 1907]]
Zoe Byrd Akins was born in [[Humansville, Missouri]], second of three children of Thomas Jasper and Sarah Elizabeth Green Akins. Her family was heavily involved with the [[Missouri Republican Party]], and for several years her father served as the state party chairman. Through her mother, Zoe Akins was related to prominent figures like [[George Washington]] and [[Duff Green]].<ref>''Dictionary of Missouri-Biography'', Lawrence O. Christensen, University of Missouri Press, 1999.</ref> Her family moved to St. Louis, Missouri when Zoe was in her early teens. She was sent to Monticello Seminary in nearby Godfrey, Illinois for her education and later Hosmer Hall preparatory school in St. Louis. While at Hosmer Hall she was a classmate of poet [[Sara Teasdale]], both graduating with the Class of 1903. It was at Monticello Seminary that Akins wrote her first play, a parody of a Greek tragedy. Following graduation Akins began writing a series of plays, poetry and criticism for various magazines and newspapers<ref>"Zoe Akins Arrives", ''The New York Times'', October 12, 1919.</ref> as well as occasional acting roles in St. Louis area theatre productions.

===Career===

Her first major dramatic work was ''Papa'', written in 1914. The comedy failed even though it greatly impressed both [[H.L. Mencken]] and [[George Jean Nathan]],<ref>H.L. Mencken, ''My Life as Author and Editor, p. 267.</ref> and she continued to write.<ref>"Modern Drama; Plays by Miss Akins and Mr. Howard in New Series", ''The New York Times'', April 26, 1914.</ref> She followed up with two other plays, ''The Magical City'' and ''Déclassée''. The latter play, which starred [[Ethel Barrymore]], was not only a great success but "something of a sensation, and her days of waiting were over."  <ref>H.L. Mencken, ''My Life as Author and Editor, p. 267.</ref> 
During this time several of her early plays were adapted for the screen. These adaptations were mostly failures, released as [[silent film]]s in a time when the industry was transitioning to sound. While some "talkie" stars had notable roles in the films ([[Walter Pidgeon]] and a young [[Clark Gable]]), most of the films are now believed to be lost. In 1930, Akins had another great success with her play, ''The Greeks Had a Word For It,'' a comedy about three models in search of rich husbands <ref>"The Play: Vine Leaves in a Heap" by J. Brooks Atkinson. ''The New York Times'' September 26, 1930.</ref>

In the early 1930s, Akins became more active in film, writing several screenplays as well as continuing to sell the rights to plays such as ''The Greeks Had a Word for It'' (1930), which was adapted for the movies three times, in 1932 (as ''[[The Greeks Had a Word for Them]]''), 1938 (as ''[[Three Blind Mice (1938 film)|Three Blind Mice]]''), and 1953 (''[[How to Marry a Millionaire]]''). Two highlights of this period were the films ''[[Sarah and Son]]'' (1930) and ''[[Morning Glory (1933 film)|Morning Glory]]'' (1933), the latter remade as ''[[Stage Struck (1958 film)|Stage Struck]]''. Both films earned their respective female leads ([[Ruth Chatterton]] and [[Katharine Hepburn]]) [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations for Best Actress (Hepburn won).

In 1935, she was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] for her [[The Old Maid (play)|dramatization]] of [[Edith Wharton]]'s ''[[Old New York (novellas)#The Old Maid (Parts One and Two) (The Fifties)|The Old Maid]]'', a melodrama set in New York City and written in five episodes stretching across time from 1839 to 1854. The play was adapted for a [[The Old Maid (1939 film)|1939 film]] starring [[Bette Davis]].

In 1936, Akins co-wrote the screenplay for ''[[Camille (1936 film)|Camille]],'' adapted from [[Alexandre Dumas, fils|Alexandre Dumas]]'s play and novel, ''[[The Lady of the Camellias|La dame aux camélias]]''  The film starred [[Greta Garbo]], [[Robert Taylor (American actor)|Robert Taylor]], and [[Lionel Barrymore]], and earned Garbo her third Oscar nomination.

=== Personal life ===
Despite the fame afforded her, Akins didn't pursue a screenwriting career beyond her early successes. In 1932, she married [[Hugo Rumbold]] (in the last year of his life) and, after several Hollywood films, she returned to writing plays and spending time with her family.<ref>"Zoe Akins to Be Wed to Hugo Rumbold" ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 8, 1932.</ref> She was rumored to be in a long-term relationship with [[Jobyna Howland]] until Howland's death in 1936. According to Anita Loos, the two squabbled often, "But such gibes actually held the key to their devotion."  <ref>Anita Loos, The Talmadge Girls, p. 98.</ref> She was the great-aunt of actress [[Laurie Metcalf]]. She lived for a short time in Morrisonville, Illinois.

Akins died in her sleep on the eve of her 72nd birthday in Los Angeles. She is buried in San Gabriel District Cemetery.<ref>Resting Places: The Burial Sites of Over 14000 Famous Persons by Scott Wilson</ref>
