'''Kirke La Shelle''' (September 23, 1862 – May 16, 1905) was an American journalist, playwright and theatrical producer. He was known for his association with such successful productions as ''The Wizard of the Nile'', ''The Princess Chic'', ''Beside the Bonnie Brier Bush'', ''Arizona'', ''The Earl of Pawtucket'', ''[[The Virginian (musical)|The Virginian]]'', ''The Education of Mr. Pipp'' and ''The Heir to the Hoorah''. La Shelle's career as a playwright and producer was relatively brief due to an illness that led to his demise at the age of forty-two.

==Newspaper years==
While still in his teens La Shelle joined the printing department of the ''Chicago Telegraph'' and eventually rose to be a [[supervisor|foreman]] with the same division at the ''Chicago Morning News''. La Shelle later became a newspaper reporter, drama critic and would, during the 1880s, go on to hold a number of reporting and editorial positions with several Chicago area newspapers. In the early 1880s La Shelle spent a year or two in [[Bismarck, North Dakota|Bismarck, Dakota Territory]] as editor of the ''Bismarck Tribune'' and later founding editor of an evening paper called the ''Daily Advertiser''. By 1884 La Shelle returned to Chicago,<ref>''Current Opinion,'' Vol. 5, July–December, 1890, p. 171</ref> where he continued working on Chicago papers and at some point composed poetry that appeared in ''[[The Ladies Home Journal]]''.<ref>''With Dog An' Gun''.

==Personal life==
On June 15, 1893, La Shelle married, in Chicago, Mazie Elizabeth Nodine, an Illinois native. The couple had two children, Mazie Maria and Kirke, born between 1898 and 1901. In 1904 La Shelle's health began to decline and he was eventually diagnosed as [[diabetic]]. La Shelle suffered two accidents early in May 1905 while at his summer residence in Bellport, Long Island—a badly cut foot from a lawn mower and serious burns to his face while attempting to repair a hot water pipe. The stress from these events were thought to have aggravated the diabetes that led to his death on May 16, 1905.<ref>Kirke La Shelle Dead as Result of Accident. ''New York Times,'' May 17, 1905, p. 9</ref>

La Shelle was laid to rest at a small cemetery near his summer home in Bellport. Serving as his [[pallbearers]] were [[Frank Vanderlip]], theatre manager Harry Hamlin, artist Lawrence Mazzanovich, author Henry L. Wilson, [[Digby Bell]], author Ray Brown, writer William Eugene Lewis and friend J. Louis White.<ref>Kirke La Shelle's Funeral.
