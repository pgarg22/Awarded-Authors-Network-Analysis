'''Pavel Golia''' (10 April 1887 – 15 August 1959) was a [[Slovenia]]n [[poet]] and [[playwright]].

==Life==
Pavel Golia was born in a relatively wealthy family in Trebnje. Between 1907 and 1915, he served as an officer in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]. In 1918, he was a journalist in [[Moscow]]. Later, he worked as a [[dramaturge]] or manager of the national theaters in [[Slovene National Theatre, Ljubljana|Ljubljana]] (1920–46, with a two-year break), [[Croatian National Theatre in Osijek|Osijek]], and [[National Theatre in Belgrade|Belgrade]]. He died in Ljubljana.

==Work==
Golia wrote his first collection of poems, titled ''Alkohol'' ("Alcohol"), in 1908. It was published only in 1914. He wrote poems for about 40 years. According to the literary historian [[Igor Grdina]], Golia was an intimate poet who wrote about alcoholism, prostitution, and deviant people. Emotions in his poetry are not serious. He was influenced by [[Oton Župančič]], but developed his own form, sometimes closer to artistry.

Golia has been praised for his plays, particularly the ones written for children. He published his first play ''Peterčkove poslednje sanje: božična povest v štirih slikah s prologom'' ("Peter's Final Dreams: A Christmas Play in Four Images with a Prologue") in 1923. His most known children plays are ''Princeska in pastirček'' ("A Princess and a Shepherd Boy"), ''Jurček'' ("Little George"), ''Srce igrač'' ("The Heart of Toys"), ''Uboga Ančka'' ("Poor Little Annie"), and ''Sneguljčica'' ("Snow White"). The expert in Slovenian youth literature [[Igor Saksida]] placed him among the best Slovenian children's playwrights.
