'''Joseph Jefferson Farjeon''' (4 June 1883 – 6 June 1955) was an English crime and mystery novelist, playwright and screenwriter. His father, brother and sister also developed successful careers in the literary world. His "Ben" novels were reissued in 2015 and 2016.

==Family==
Born in [[Hampstead]], [[London]],<ref>[http://search.findmypast.co.uk/results/world-records/england-and-wales-births-1837-2006?firstname=joseph&lastname=farjeon.]</ref> Farjeon was the grandson of the American actor [[Joseph Jefferson]], after whom he was named.<ref name="Edwards" >In Edwards's Introduction to the 2014 reissue of ''Mystery in White. A Christmas Crime Storey'' (London: British Library, [1937]).</ref> His parents were Jefferson's daughter Maggie (1853–1935) and [[Benjamin Farjeon]] (1838–1903), a Victorian novelist, who was born in [[Whitechapel]] to an impoverished immigrant family and travelled widely before returning to England in 1868. Joseph Jefferson Farjeon's brothers were [[Herbert Farjeon|Herbert]], a dramatist and scholar, and [[Harry Farjeon|Harry]], who became a composer. His sister [[Eleanor Farjeon|Eleanor]] became a children's author.<ref>Lewis Melville, "Farjeon, Benjamin Leopold (1838–1903)", rev. William Baker. ODNB, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33078 Retrieved 21 November 2014, pay-walled.]</ref> His daughter [[Joan Jefferson Farjeon]] (1913–2006) was a theatre set designer.<ref>Obituary in ''The Independent'', 14 August 2006. [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/joan-jefferson-farjeon-411802.html Retrieved 21 November 2014.]</ref>

==Career: "creepy skill"==
Farjeon worked for ten years for [[Amalgamated Press]] in London before going freelance, working nine hours a day at his writing desk.<ref>Publisher's biographical note in the Penguin Crime edition of the novelized ''No. 17''.</ref> One of Farjeon's best known works was a 1925 play, ''[[Number 17 (play)|Number 17]]'', which was adapted into several films, including ''[[Number Seventeen]]'' (1932) directed by [[Alfred Hitchcock]], and joined the UK Penguin Crime series as a novel in 1939. He also wrote the screenplay for [[Michael Powell]]'s ''[[My Friend the King]]'' (1932) and provided the story for [[Bernard Vorhaus]]'s ''[[The Ghost Camera]]'' (1933).<ref>IMDb. [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0267537/ Retrieved 21 November 2014.] {{unreliable?|date=December 2020}}</ref>

Farjeon's crime novels were admired by [[Dorothy L. Sayers]], who called him "unsurpassed for creepy skill in mysterious adventures."<ref name="Edwards" /> His obituarist in ''[[The Times]]'' talked of "ingenious and entertaining plots and characterization," while ''[[The New York Times]]'', reviewing an early novel, ''Master Criminal'' (1924), states that "Mr. Farjeon displays a great deal of knowledge about story-telling... and multiplies the interest of his plot through a terse, telling style and a rigid compression." ''[[The Saturday Review of Literature]]'' called ''Death in the Inkwell'' (1942) an "amusing, satirical, and frequently hair-raising yarn of an author who got dangerously mixed up with his imaginary characters."<ref>gadetection site. [http://gadetection.pbworks.com/w/page/7930548/Farjeon,%20J%20Jefferson. Retrieved 21 November 2014.]</ref>

A significant revival of interest in the [[Golden age of detective fiction]] followed the 2014 success of [[The British Library]] reissue of ''Mystery in White: A Christmas Crime Story.''<ref name="Edwards"/> Two more reissues by Farjeon followed in 2015: ''Thirteen Guests'' and ''The Z Murders''. ''Mystery in White'' is also one of at least three of his novels to have appeared in Italian,<ref>As ''Sotto la neve'' Polillo Editore site [http://www.polilloeditore.it/index.php?main_page=index&manufacturers_id=95 Retrieved 21 November 2014.]</ref> French, Dutch (''Het mysterie in de sneeuw'' – The Mystery in the Snow), German,<ref>Drei Raben Verlag [https://classicrimes.homepage.t-online.de/drraben.htm Retrieved 21 November 2014].</ref> Spanish, Polish and Russian.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

''Seven Dead'' has been reissued by The British Library (September 2017). The novel sees the return of Detective-Inspector Kendall, first seen, in the words of its central character "in the case of the ''Thirteen Guests''. What I liked about him was that he didn't play the violin, or have a wooden leg or anything of that sort. He just got on with it."

Since 2016, all eight Detective Ben novels have been reissued by [[HarperCollins]] from the [[Collins Crime Club]] archive as a series titled "Ben the tramp mystery".<ref>{{Cite web |website=harpercollins.com |url=https://www.harpercollins.com/search?q=collins+crime+club+farjeon |accessdate=20 August 2020 |title=HarperCollins}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |website=librarything.com|url=https://www.librarything.com/series/Ben+the+Tramp |accessdate=20 August 2020 |title=LibraryThing}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |website=worldcat.org |url=https://www.worldcat.org/search?qt=hotseries&q=se%3A%22Ben+the+tramp+mystery#%2528x0%253Abook%2Bx4%253Aprintbook%2529format |accessdate=20 August 2020 |title=WorldCat}}</ref>
