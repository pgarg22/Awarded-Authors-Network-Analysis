'''Jovan Jovanović "Zmaj"''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Јован Јовановић Змаj}}, pronounced {{IPA-sh|jɔ̌v̞an jɔv̞ǎːnɔv̞it͡ɕ zmâj|}}; 24 November 1833 – 1 June 1904) was a [[Serbia]]n poet.

Jovanović worked as a physician; he wrote in many poetry genres, including [[Love poetry|love]], [[lyric poetry|lyric]], [[patriotic poetry|patriotic]], [[political poetry|political]], and [[Youth poetry|youth]], but he remains best known for his [[children's poetry]]. His [[nursery rhyme]]s have entered the Serbian national consciousness and people sing them to their children without knowing who wrote them. Jovanović also translated the works of some of the great poets, such as Russians [[Lermontov]] and [[Pushkin]], Germans [[Goethe]] and [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]], and the American [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow|Longfellow]].

Jovanović's nickname [[Zmaj|''Zmaj'' or ''Змај'']] (dragon) derives from the [[May Assembly|3 May 1848 assembly]].{{efn|in [[Serbian Cyrillic]]3.мај. The dot (indicating an ordinal number in Serbian) was mistakenly left out, thus the writing read "3мај".<ref name="auto2">{{Cite journal|last1=Lešić|first1=Aleksandar|last2=Bumbaširević|first2=Marko|date=2004|title=Jovan Jovanović Zmaj, pesnik i lekar, 100 godina nakon smrti|url=http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/0370-8179/2004/0370-81790408277L.pdf|journal=Institute for Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology, Clinic Center of Serbia}}</ref>}}

==Biography==
[[Image:Zmajev muzej, Sremska Kamenica.JPG|thumb|left|House of Jovan Jovanović Zmaj in Sremska Kamenica]]

Zmaj was born in [[Novi Sad]], which was then part of [[Bács-Bodrog County|Batsch-Bodrog County]] ([[Kingdom of Hungary]], [[Austrian Empire]]; today in [[Serbia]]), on 24 November 1833. His family was old and noble,<ref name="auto4">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rastko.rs/istorija/delo/10074|title=Пројекат Растко: Божидар Ковачек : Јован Јовановић Змај (1833–1904)|website=www.rastko.rs|access-date=2020-01-28}}</ref> and had roots in modern-day [[North Macedonia]].<ref name="auto4"/> The Jovanovićs lived in [[Vojvodina]] as of the 18th century.<ref name="auto4"/> Zmaj's father Pavle served as the mayor of Novi Sad after the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]] and his three brothers were soldiers, government officials and Serbian patriots.<ref name="auto4"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/reportaze/aktuelno.293.html:590992-Jovanovici-dali-cetiri-zmaja-srpstva|title=Jovanovići dali četiri zmaja srpstva|website=www.novosti.rs|language=sr-Latn|access-date=2020-01-28}}</ref> In his early childhood he showed a desire to learn by heart the [[Serbian epic poetry|Serbian national songs]] that were recited to him. As a child he began to compose poems. He finished elementary school in the town, and attended secondary school in [[Kiskunhalas|Halas]] and [[Bratislava|Preßburg]] (today Bratislava), later studying law in [[Budapest|Ofenpesth]] (Budapest), [[Prague]] and [[Vienna]].<ref name="auto4"/> This was his father's wish but his own inclinations prompted him to take up the study of medicine. Zmaj then returned to his native city, where he accepted prominent official position. A year later, his poetic instincts caused him to leave his job to devote himself entirely to literary work. In 1870, Zmaj returned to Novi Sad to work as a doctor, motivated by the [[tuberculosis]] from which his wife and children were suffering.<ref name="auto4"/>

His literary career began in 1849 and in 1852 his first poem was printed in a journal called ''Srbski Letopis'' (Serbian Annual Review); he contributed to this and to other journals, notably ''Neven'' and ''Sedmica''.<ref name="auto4"/> From that period until 1870, besides his original poems, he made many translations of works by [[Sándor Petőfi]] and [[János Arany]] to [[Serbian language|Serbian]] from [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], from [[Russian language|Russian]] the works of [[Lermontov]], as well as some German and Austrian poets.<ref name="auto4"/> In 1861 he edited the comic journal ''Komarac'' (''The Mosquito''), with Đorđe Rajković. That same year he started the literary journal ''Javor'' and contributed many poems to these journals.<ref name="auto4"/>

In 1861, Zmaj married; during the years that followed he produced a series of lyrical poems called ''Đulići'', which probably remains his masterpiece.<ref name="auto4"/><ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rastko.rs/knjizevnost/jderetic_knjiz/jderetic-knjiz_07.html|title=Jovan Deretic: Kratka istorija srpske knjizevnosti|website=www.rastko.rs|access-date=2020-01-28}}</ref><ref name="auto2"/> In 1862, greatly to his regret, he discontinued his journal ''Javor''. He was politically engaged and sympathized with the ideas of the ''[[United Serbian Youth]]'', a movement that attracted a number of influential figures in Serbian public life in the 1860s and 1870s.<ref name="auto4"/>

In 1863, Zmaj was elected director of the [[Tekelianum]] at [[Budapest]].<ref name="auto4"/> He renewed the study of medicine at the university and became a [[doctor of medicine]]. Zmaj wrote a lot of articles on hygiene, health and diet, and several scientific works.<ref name="auto2"/> He also devoted himself to the education of Serbian youth. During his stay in Budapest he founded the literary society [[Preodnica]], of which he was president. In 1864 he started the satirical journal "[[Zmaj]]" ("The Dragon"), which was so popular its name became a part of his own. In 1866, his comic play "Šaran" was given with great success.<ref name="auto4"/> In 1870, he began working as a physician. He was also an active advocate of [[cremation]].<ref name="auto4"/> [[Matica Srpska]], the Serbian Medical Society and [[Serbian Literary Guild]] made Zmaj a full member.<ref name="auto2"/>

The death of his wife in 1872 was followed by that of the couple's only child who outlived her mother, out of his five children.<ref name="auto4"/> He was very sad and wrote many sad poems. In 1873 he started another comic journal, the ''[[Žiža]]''.<ref name="auto4"/> In 1877 he began an illustrated chronicle of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War]], and in 1878 began his popular comic journal ''[[Starmali]]''.<ref name="auto3">{{Cite web|url=http://zlatousti.org/clanakview/index?id=117|title=Bogoslovija Svetog Jovana Zlatoustog u Kragujevcu, , ПЕСНИШТВО ЈОВАНА ЈОВАНОВИЋА ЗМАЈА|website=zlatousti.org|access-date=2020-01-29}}</ref> During this period he wrote poems and prose, including short novels.

Zmaj died on 1 June 1904 in [[Sremska Kamenica]], Serbia.<ref name="auto"/>

==Literary works==
Zmaj wrote lyrical songs under the collective titles ''Đulići'' (Little Rosebuds) and ''Đulići Uveoci'' (Faded Little Rosebuds), his most-creative work.<ref name="auto3"/> He wrote six large volumes of his ''[[Pevanija]]'' (The Book of Songs), and several smaller collections including [[satire]]s, [[epigram]]s, and children's songs. His work were published in the United States by [[Robert Underwood Johnson]], who was editor and publisher of New York City's ''[[Century Magazine]]'' and a good friend of [[Nikola Tesla]].<ref name="auto1">{{Cite web|url=https://facebookreporter.org/2011/12/18/%d1%82%d0%b5%d1%81%d0%bb%d0%b0-%d0%b8-%d0%b7%d0%bc%d0%b0%d1%98-%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%b5%d1%80%d0%b3%d0%b8%d1%98%d0%b0-%d0%b8-%d1%81%d0%b2%d0%b5%d1%82%d0%bb%d0%be%d1%81%d1%82-%d1%81%d0%b2%d0%b5%d1%82/|title=ТЕСЛА И ЗМАЈ – ЕНЕРГИЈА И СВЕТЛОСТ – СВЕТЛОСНИ ЗМАЈ|date=2011-12-18|website=СРБски ФБРепортер|language=sr-RS|access-date=2020-01-28}}</ref> Tesla himself translated some poems by Zmaj.<ref name="auto1"/> In the following we have the poet's definition of poetry:

<poem>
Where is Pain and dire Distress,
Songs shall soothe like soft caress;
Though the stoutest courage fails,
Song's an anchor in all gales;
When all others fail to reach,
Song shall be the thrilling speech;
Love and friends and comfort fled,
Song shall linger by your bed;
And when Doubt shall question, Why?
Song shall lift you to the sky.
</poem>

Zmaj is best known for his poetry for children and was one of the first authors of comic strips in Serbia.<ref>[http://www.rastko.rs/strip/1/zupan-draginicic_1/neven_l.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616012458/http://www.rastko.rs/strip/1/zupan-draginicic_1/neven_l.html |date=16 June 2011 }} [Projekat Rastko&#93; Zdravko Zupan i Slavko Draginčić: Istorija jugoslovenskog stripa I].

==Legacy==
[[Image:500000000000 dinars.jpg|thumb|right|Zmaj was featured on the five-hundred billion [[Yugoslav dinar]] banknote.]]

The [[Zmaj Children Games]] (Змајеве дечје игре/Zmajeve dečje igre), one of the biggest  festivals for children in Serbia, are named after Jovan Jovanović Zmaj. The town of [[Sremska Kamenica]] bore the name Zmajeva Kamenica (Zmaj's Kamenica) in his honour. He is included in lists of [[The 100 most prominent Serbs]]. During his lifetime, Zmaj had acquired the title of the "people's poet", an expression of esteem also befitting the title of [[Poet laureate]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://arhiva.unilib.rs/unilib/o_nama/izlozbe/jovan_jovanovic_zmaj/zasto.php|title=Национални дан књиге {{!}} Јован Јовановић Змај|website=arhiva.unilib.rs|access-date=2020-01-29}}</ref>

[[August Šenoa]] wrote highly of his poetry.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Aleksov|first=Bojan|date=2011|title=JOVAN JOVANOVIČ ZMAJ AND THE SERBIAN IDENTITY BETWEEN POETRY AND HISTORY|url=https://www.cas.bg/uploads/files/We%20the%20People/B.%20Aleksov.pdf|journal=CAS Working Paper Series|volume=3}}</ref> Literary historian Jovan Deretić considered Zmaj to be one of the central figures of Serbian Romanticism and Serbian literature of the second half of the 19th century. Deretić praised his poems, translations and satirical works.<ref name="auto"/>

Children's poetry written by Zmaj is still popular in Serbia and the wider [[Balkans]] region.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kulturkokoska.rs/dvoboj-jovan-jovanovic-zmaj-protiv-policije-spicli-zandara/|title=Dvoboj: Jovan Jovanović Zmaj protiv policije, špicli i žandara|last=Svilengaćin|first=Gordana|date=2018-03-13|website=Kultur!Kokoška|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-29}}</ref>
