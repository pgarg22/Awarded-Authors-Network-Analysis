During these years, ten of Bullins's plays were produced by the Players, including ''In the Wine Time'' and ''[[Goin' a Buffalo]]''.

==1970s and later==
Bullins returned to the East Coast in 1967.{{Sfn|Peterson|1988|p=82}} From 1973, he was playwright-in-residence at the [[American Place Theatre]].{{Sfn|Menson-Furr|2004|p=65}} He founded the Bronx-based [[Surviving Theatre]], active from 1974 to around 1980.{{Sfn|Peterson|1988|p=82}} From 1975 to 1983, he was on staff at [[The Public Theater]] with the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]]'s Writers' Unit. During these years, Bullins wrote two children's plays, titled ''I Am Lucy Terry'' and ''The Mystery of [[Phillis Wheatley]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gussow |first1=Mel |author-link=Mel Gussow|title=Stage: 'Phyllis Wheatley' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/02/04/archives/stage-phyllis-wheatley.html |access-date=November 17, 2021 |work=The New York Times |date=February 4, 1976 |quote=When writers of children's theater contemplate significant events, such as moments in the nation's history, they tend to glamorize or to condescend.

Bullins later returned to school, and received a bachelor's degree in English and playwriting from [[Antioch University]] in San Francisco.<ref name="contempblackbio">{{Cite book|last=Manheim|first=James M.|title=Contemporary Black Biography|publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|Gale]]|year=2000|isbn=978-1-4144-3553-4|editor-last=Oblender|editor-first=David G.|volume=25|pages=[[iarchive:contemporaryblac0025unse/page/34/mode/1up|34–36]]|chapter=Ed Bullins 1935–|issn=1058-1316|oclc=527366290}}</ref> As of the late 1980s, Bullins taught drama at the [[City College of San Francisco]].{{Sfn|Peterson|1988|p=82}} In 1995, he became a professor at [[Northeastern University]].<ref name="contempauthors" />

In addition to Bullins's playwriting, he wrote short stories and novels, including ''The Hungered One'' and ''The Reluctant Rapist''. ''The Reluctant Rapist'' features Bullins's alter ego, Steve Benson, who appears in many of Bullins's works.<ref name="Sanders, Leslie 1985" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Scharine|first=Richard G.|year=1979|title=Ed Bullins Was Steve Benson (But Who Is He Now?)|journal=[[Black American Literature Forum]]|volume=13|issue=3|pages=103–109|doi=10.2307/3041525|jstor=3041525}}</ref>

Bullins died aged 86 on November 13, 2021, in [[Roxbury, Boston]], Massachusetts, due to complications from [[dementia]].<ref name="nytobit" />

== Themes ==
Samuel A. Hay, Bullins's biographer, writes that Bullins rejected models of theater advanced by Amiri Baraka, who wrote and promoted [[protest art]], and [[Alain LeRoy Locke]], who suggested that Black playwrights should condemn racism by producing "well-made plays".{{Sfn|Hay|1997|p=32}} Instead, Hay argues, Bullins's writing aimed to "get people upset by making them look at racism in totally new ways".{{Sfn|Hay|1997|p=33}} By contrast, the critic W. D. E. Andrews argues that the distinction between Baraka and Bullins lies instead in Bullins's efforts to describe Black lived experience, as opposed to referring to relations between Black and white people.{{Sfn|Andrews|1980|pp=178–179}}

[[Ishmael Reed]] has been quoted as saying of Bullins: "He was able to get the grass roots to come to his plays. ...He was a Black playwright who spoke to the values of the urban experience. Some of those people had probably never seen a play before."<ref name="nytobit" />

==Awards==
Bullins received numerous awards for his playwriting. He twice received the Black Arts Alliance Award, for ''The Fabulous Miss Marie'' and ''In the New England Winter''. In 1971, Bullins won the [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggenheim Fellowship for playwriting]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ed Bullins|url=https://www.gf.org/fellows/all-fellows/ed-bullins/|url-status=live|access-date=November 17, 2021|publisher=[[Guggenheim Fellowship]]|language=en-US}}</ref> He received an [[Obie Award]] for ''The Taking of Miss Janie'',{{Sfn|Menson-Furr|2004|p=65}} which also received a [[New York Drama Critics Circle Award]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fisher|first=James|title=Historical Dictionary of Contemporary American Theater|date=July 15, 2021|publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield]]|isbn=978-1-5381-2302-7|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=kRk0EAAAQBAJ&pg=PA153 153]|language=en}}</ref> Also in 1975, he won the [[Drama Desk Vernon Rice Award]], four [[Rockefeller Foundation]] playwriting grants, and two [[National Endowment for the Arts]] playwriting grants.
