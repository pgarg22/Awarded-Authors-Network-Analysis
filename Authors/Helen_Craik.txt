'''Helen Craik''' (c. 1751 – 11 June 1825) was a Scottish poet and novelist, and a correspondent of [[Robert Burns]]. She praised him for being a "native genius, gay, unique and strong" in an introductory poem to his Glenriddell Manuscripts.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=aGk3BQAAQBAJ&pg=PA404. ''The Oxford Edition of the Works of Robert Burns''. Vol. I, ed. Nigel Leask (Oxford, UK: OUP, 2014), p. 404, note 390. Retrieved 29 June 2015.]</ref>

==Early life==
Helen Craik was born at [[Arbigland]], [[Kirkbean]] in the historical county of [[Kirkcudbrightshire]], probably in 1751, as one of the six legitimate children of William Craik (1703–1798), a laird keen to improve a large estate of relatively poor land, and his wife Elizabeth (died 1787), daughter of William Stewart of [[New Abbey]], also near [[Dumfries]].

The naval captain [[John Paul Jones]] (1747–1792), who played a prominent part in founding the US navy, was also born at Arbigland. He was rumoured to be Helen Craik's father's illegitimate son.<ref name="ODNB">{{Cite ODNB |id=45843 |title=Craik, Helen (1751–1825) |origyear=2004 |year=2011 |last=Craciun |first=Adriana}}</ref> Suppositions that one of her sisters was the novelist [[Catherine Cuthbertson]] have not been substantiated.<ref>[http://extra.shu.ac.uk/corvey/corinne/Corinne%20authors/1%20cuthbertson/Cuthbertson%20biography.htm ''Biography of Catherine Cuthbertson by Beryl Chaudhuri'', Corvey "Adopt an Author".

==Burns==
Craik became a correspondent of Robert Burns. Two of his letters to her have survived. The first, dated 9 August 1790 and written from [[Ellisland Farm|Ellisland]], accompanied manuscript copies of two of his "late Pieces".<ref>[http://www.robertburns.org/encyclopedia/CraikHelen17501511825.239.shtml ''The Burns Encyclopedia''. Retrieved 19 July 2015.]</ref> He also wrote to her expressing admiration for a poem of hers, "Helen", which has since been lost, as has much of her other poetry.

A later generation saw "Wertherism" in her poetry, in the sense that its sentimentalism was influenced by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s [[epistolary novel]] ''[[The Sorrows of Werther]]'' (1774, rev. 1787).<ref>George Neilson, writing in ''The Glasgow Herald'' of 15 March 1919, quoted in ''ODNB''.</ref> Craik was also a friend of the fellow poet [[Maria Riddell]],<ref name="Feminist">''The Feminist Companion to Literature in English'', eds Virginia Blain, Patricia Clements and Isobel Grundy (London: Batsford, 1990), pp. 246–247.</ref> who was a niece by marriage to Burns's patron [[Robert Riddell]], to whom Craik addressed two poems that survive in manuscript.<ref name="ODNB" />

==Cumberland==
However, a breach may have appeared in the Craik family over the purported suicide of a groom on her father's estate. He was locally thought to have been engaged to marry Helen Craik and murdered for that reason by a member of her family. Whether this was true or not, Craik moved abruptly in 1792 from Arbigland to [[Flimby]] Hall, [[Cumberland]], which belonged to relatives of hers, and stayed there for the rest of her life.<ref name="ODNB" />

==Novels==
If true, those dramatic events are echoed in the five novels of hers published anonymously between 1796 and 1805 by the firm of [[Minerva Press]],<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zs6qBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA83 Retrieved 29 June 2015] ''The Biographical Dictionary of Scottish Women'', eds. Elizabeth L. Ewan, etc., Edinburgh, Scotland: Edinburgh UP, 2006, pp. 82–83.</ref> best known for sentimental and [[Gothic fiction]]. One of them, ''Adelaide de Narbonne'' (1800), has been called "perhaps the most impressive" of novels of opinion "in terms of its integration of plot and politics."<ref>M. O. Grenby, "Novels of Opinion". In: ''The Cambridge Companion to British Literature of the French Revolution in the 1790s'', ed. Pamela Clemit (Cambridge, UK: CUP, 2011), p. 167.

Some parallels to Craik's novels have been found in [[Frances Burney|Fanny Burney]]'s novel ''The Wanderer'', set in 1793 and written in the 1790s and intermittently up to its publication in 1814. "Like Burney, Craik does not ultimately support the French Revolution (though she creates some genial revolutionary characters like Corday [in ''Julia de St. Pierre'', 1796]), but rather removes her characters 'from the increasing anarchy prevalent in France' to 'the more peaceful island of Great Britain'" (p. 368).<ref>Adriana Craciun and Kari Lokke, eds: ''Rebellious Hearts. British Women Writers and the French Revolution'' (Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 2001), p. 222 [https://books.google.com/books?id=auxPmpSkTjsC&pg=PA219 Retrieved 19 July 2015.]</ref>

''Julia de Saint Pierre'' is dedicated to a likewise anonymous family friend. It has a heroine who survives victimization by a degraded mother, by the mother's lover, and by a young man who unexpectedly betrays her. ''Henry of Northumberland, or The Hermit's Cell'' (1800), with a gloomy medieval background, is the only one of the five not set in her own time. ''Adelaide de Narbonne'' turns the historical [[Charlotte Corday]], assassin of [[Jean-Paul Marat]], into a rational republican. ''Stella of the North, or The Foundling of the Ship'' (1802, set in her native [[Dumfriesshire]]) features two mysterious babies, one dead and one to be heroine. Her final novel was ''The Nun and her Daughter, or Memoirs of the Courville Family'' (1805).<ref name="Feminist" />

==Memorial==
Craik eventually inherited a half-share in the Flimby estate, but no part of her father's at Arbigland, which went to a distant male relative, John Hamilton. She died unmarried at Flimby Hall on 11 June 1825. Her obituaries and her memorial in the village church call her a published author in English and French (works in the latter have not survived) and a philanthropist to the poor, a theme that appears in her novels.<ref name="ODNB" />
