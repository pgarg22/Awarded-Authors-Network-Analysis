==Military career==
Davison joined the [[United States Army]] in 1943, shortly after becoming a [[Naturalized citizen of the United States]].  He had previously served as a [[paymaster]] in the [[Royal Navy]]. During [[World War II]], Davison attained the rank of [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant colonel]] in the [[United States Army]].  He was named director of the [[German prisoners of war in the United States#Special Projects Division|Special Projects Division]], which was responsible for overseeing the re-education of German prisoners of war.  Many of Davidson's poems from this time-frame appear to express doubts about the mission he had been assigned.  Davidson had no knowledge of German language, culture, or politics, and so struggled to craft a suitable program.<ref name=RonRobin>{{cite book|last1=Robin|first1=Ron|title=The Barbed-Wire College|date=1995|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400821624|pages=43â€“46|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/books/9781400821624/|accessdate=14 August 2015}}</ref>
