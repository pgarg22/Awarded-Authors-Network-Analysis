He is best known for novels about a barrister named [[Rumpole|Horace Rumpole]].

==Early life==
Mortimer was born in [[Hampstead]], London, the only child of Kathleen May ([[married and maiden names|née]] Smith) and (Herbert) Clifford Mortimer (1884–1961), a divorce and probate [[barrister]]<ref>{{Cite ODNB |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-100790 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/100790 |title=The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |year=2004 |isbn=9780198614111}}</ref><ref>The Law Times, vol. 232, 1961, p. 210, 'Obituary- Mr Herbert Clifford Mortimer'</ref><ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/69/John-Mortimer.html John Mortimer Biography (1923-2009)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215739/http://www.filmreference.com/film/69/John-Mortimer.html |date=3 March 2016.}}</ref> who became blind in 1936 when he hit his head on the door frame of a London taxi<ref>page 14, Graham Lord, John Mortimer: The Devil's Advocate (2005)</ref> but still pursued his career.

[the law] gets you out of the house."<ref name="Telegraph"/>

At 17, Mortimer went up to [[Brasenose College, Oxford]], where he read law, though he was actually based at [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] because the Brasenose buildings had been requisitioned for the war effort.<ref name="Indie">David Hughes [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/sir-john-mortimer-lawyer-and-writer-who-created-rumpole-of-the-bailey-and-elegised-a-bygone-england-1418276.html "Sir John Mortimer: Lawyer and writer who created Rumpole of the Bailey and elegised a bygone England"], {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304083109/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/sir-john-mortimer-lawyer-and-writer-who-created-rumpole-of-the-bailey-and-elegised-a-bygone-england-1418276.html |date=4 March 2016}} ''The Independent'', 17 January 2009.</ref> In July 1942, at the end of his second year, he was sent down from Oxford by [[John Lowe (Dean of Christ Church)|John Lowe]], Dean of Christ Church, after romantic letters to a [[Bradfield College]] sixth-former, [[Quentin Edwards]], later a [[Queen's Counsel|QC]], were discovered by the young man's housemaster.<ref name="Grove">Valerie Grove [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article5533223.ece "Rumpole creator John Mortimer dies at 85"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005183429/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article5533223.ece |date=5 October 2009 }}, ''The Times'', 16 January 2009.</ref><ref name="Times1"/> But Mortimer was still allowed to take his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in law in October 1943.

==Early writing career==
With weak eyes and doubtful lungs, Mortimer was classified as medically unfit for military service in [[World War II]].<ref name="Telegraph"/> He worked for the [[Crown Film Unit]] under [[Laurie Lee]], writing scripts for propaganda documentaries.

<blockquote>I lived in London and went on journeys in blacked-out trains to factories and coal-mines and military and air force installations. For the first and, in fact, the only time in my life I was, thanks to Laurie Lee, earning my living entirely as a writer. If I have knocked the documentary ideal, I would not wish to sound ungrateful to the Crown Film Unit. I was given great and welcome opportunities to write dialogue, construct scenes and try and turn ideas into some kind of visual drama.<ref>John Mortimer ''Clinging to the Wreckage: A Part of Life'', 1982, p. 71.</ref></blockquote>

He based his first novel, ''Charade'', on his experiences with the [[Crown Film Unit]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Mortimer made his radio debut as a dramatist in 1955, adapting his own novel ''[[Like Men Betrayed]]'' for the [[BBC]] [[Light Programme]]. His debut as an original playwright came with ''[[The Dock Brief]]'' starring [[Michael Hordern]] as a hapless [[barrister]], first broadcast in 1957 on [[BBC Radio]]'s [[Third Programme]], and later televised with the same cast. It later appeared in a double bill with ''[[What Shall We Tell Caroline?]]'' at the [[Lyric Hammersmith]] in April 1958, before transferring to the [[Garrick Theatre]]. ''[[The Dock Brief]]'' was revived by [[Christopher Morahan]] in 2007 for a touring double bill with ''Legal Fictions''.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/11/19/btlegal119.xml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120052002/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/11/19/btlegal119.xml |url-status=dead |archive-date=20 November 2007 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London, UK |title=Legal Fiction: Wit, humanity and nostalgic English melancholy |date=19 November 2007 |access-date=7 May 2010}}</ref> It won the Prix Italia in 1957, and its success on radio, stage, and television led Mortimer to prefer writing for performance rather than writing novels.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.suttonelms.org.uk/jmortimer.html |work=Diversity Website Radio Drama |author=Pain, Nesta |title=John Mortimer Radio Plays |date=1961 |access-date=20 October 2021}}</ref> 

Mortimer's play ''[[A Voyage Round My Father]]'', first broadcast on radio in 1963, is autobiographical, recounting his experiences as a young barrister and his relations with his blind father. It was televised by [[BBC Television]] in 1969 with [[Mark Dignam]] in the title role. In a lengthier version, the play became a stage success – first at [[Greenwich Theatre]] with Dignam, then in 1971 at the [[Theatre Royal Haymarket]] with [[Alec Guinness]]). In 1981 it was remade by [[Thames Television]] with [[Laurence Olivier]] as the father and [[Alan Bates]] as young Mortimer. In 1965, he and his wife wrote the screenplay for the [[Otto Preminger]] film ''[[Bunny Lake is Missing]]'', which also starred Olivier.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Legal career==
Mortimer was called to the Bar ([[Inner Temple]]) in 1948, at the age of 25. His early career covered testamentary and divorce work, but on [[Queen's Counsel|taking silk]] in 1966, he began to undertake criminal law.<ref name="Telegraph"/> His highest profile came from cases relating to claims of [[Obscenity#United Kingdom|obscenity]], which, according to Mortimer, were "alleged to be testing the frontiers of tolerance."<ref name="IHT"/>

He has sometimes been cited wrongly as one in the ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover#British obscenity trial|Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' obscenity trial defence team.<ref>His biographer Valerie Grove dismisses this in [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article5533223.ece tribute article] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005183429/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article5533223.ece |date=5 October 2009}}.</ref> He did, however, successfully defend publishers [[John Calder]] and Marion Boyars in an 1968 appeal against a conviction for publishing [[Hubert Selby Jr.]]'s ''[[Last Exit to Brooklyn#Trial|Last Exit to Brooklyn]]''.<ref name="Telegraph"/> He assumed a similar role three years later, this time unsuccessfully, for Richard Handyside, the English publisher of ''[[The Little Red Schoolbook]]''.<ref name="Telegraph"/>

In 1971, Mortimer managed to defend the editors of the satirical paper ''[[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]'' against a charge of "conspiracy to corrupt and debauch the morals of the young of the Realm", which might have carried a sentence of 12 years' hard labour.<ref>[https://flashbak.com/the-schoolkids-oz-dirty-books-and-the-downfall-of-the-dirty-squad-56477/ The "Schoolkids" Oz, Soho, and the Downfall of the "Dirty Squad"] ''flashbak.com'', accessed 2 November 2020.</ref><ref>[https://www.indexoncensorship.org/2014/06/archive/ From the archive: John Mortimer on defending Felix Dennis at the Oz trial] 24 June 2014 ''www.indexoncensorship.org'', accessed 2 November 2020.</ref> In 1976, he defended ''[[Gay News]]'' editor Denis Lemon (''[[Whitehouse v. Lemon]]'') against charges of [[blasphemous libel]] for publishing [[James Kirkup]]'s ''[[The Love That Dares to Speak Its Name]]''; Lemon was given a suspended prison sentence, which was overturned on appeal.<ref>Brett Humphreys [http://www.pinktriangle.org.uk/glh/214/humphreys.html "The Law that Dared to Lay the Blame..."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303172729/http://www.pinktriangle.org.uk/glh/214/humphreys.html |date=3 March 2016}}, pinktriangle.org.uk; accessed 13 January 2016.</ref> He successfully defended [[Virgin Records]] in a 1977 obscenity hearing for using the word [[bollocks]] in the title of the [[Sex Pistols]] album ''[[Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols]]'' and the manager of the Nottingham branch of [[Virgin Megastores|Virgin record shop chain]] for displaying and selling the record. Mortimer retired from the bar in 1984.<ref name="Telegraph"/>

==Later writing career==
Mortimer is best remembered for creating a barrister named [[Rumpole|Horace Rumpole]], inspired by his father Clifford,<ref>Robert McCrum, Mortimer Tribute, ''The Observer'', p. 29, 18 January 2009 {{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/jan/18/john-mortimer-fiction1 |title=Accidental barrister who wielded his wit to share life's big joke |access-date=9 April 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122051145/http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2009/jan/18/john-mortimer-fiction1 |archive-date=22 January 2009 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=18 January 2009 |last1=McCrum |first1=Robert}}</ref> whose speciality is defending those accused in London's [[Old Bailey]]. Mortimer created Rumpole for a [[BBC]] ''[[Play For Today]]'' in 1975. Although not Mortimer's first choice of actor – in an interview on the DVD set, he said he wanted [[Alistair Sim]] "but he turned out to be dead so he couldn't take it on" – Australian-born [[Leo McKern]] played Rumpole with gusto and proved popular. The idea was developed into a series, ''[[Rumpole of the Bailey]]'', for [[Thames Television]], in which McKern kept the lead role. Mortimer also wrote a series of Rumpole books. In September–October 2003, [[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast four new 45-minute Rumpole plays by Mortimer with [[Timothy West]] in the title role. Mortimer also dramatised many real-life cases of the barrister [[Edward Marshall-Hall]] in a radio series with former ''[[Doctor Who]]'' star [[Tom Baker]] as protagonist.

In 1975 and 1976, Mortimer adapted eight of [[Graham Greene]]’s short stories for episodes of ''[[Shades of Greene]]'' presented by [[Thames Television]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Greene |first=Graham |date=1975 |title=Shades of Greene |location=London |publisher=The Bodley Head & William Heinemann}}</ref> Mortimer was credited with writing the script for [[Granada Television]]'s 1981 serialization of ''[[Brideshead Revisited (TV serial)|Brideshead Revisited]]'', based on the novel by [[Evelyn Waugh]]. However, Graham Lord's unofficial biography, ''John Mortimer: The Devil's Advocate'',<ref>Published in United States as ''John Mortimer. The Secret Lives of Rumpole's Creator'' (New York, Thomas Dunne Books, 2006)</ref> revealed in 2005 that none of Mortimer's submitted scripts had in fact been used and the screenplay was actually written by the series' producer and director. Mortimer adapted [[John Fowles]]'s ''The Ebony Tower'' starring [[Laurence Olivier]] for Granada in 1984. In 1986, his adaptation of his own novel ''[[Paradise Postponed]]'' was televised. He wrote the script, based on the autobiography of [[Franco Zeffirelli]], for the 1999 film ''[[Tea with Mussolini]]'', directed by Zeffirelli and starring [[Joan Plowright]], [[Cher]], [[Judi Dench]], [[Maggie Smith]] and [[Lily Tomlin]]. From 2004, Mortimer worked as a consultant for the politico-legal US "dramedy" television show ''[[Boston Legal]]''.<ref>[http://features.csmonitor.com/books/2009/01/16/in-appreciation-of-john-mortimer In appreciation of John Mortimer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090120232809/http://features.csmonitor.com/books/2009/01/16/in-appreciation-of-john-mortimer |date=20 January 2009}}, Csmonitor, 16 January 2009; accessed 13 January 2016.</ref>

Mortimer developed his career as a dramatist by rising early to write before attending court. His work in total includes over 50 books, plays and scripts.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Daniel |first=Anne |year=2003 |title=John (Clifford) Mortimer |journal=Dictionary of Literary Biography |volume=271 |via=Literature Resource Center}}</ref>  Besides 13 episodes of Rumpole dramatized for radio in 1980, several others of his works were broadcast on the BBC, including the true crime series ''John Mortimer Presents: The Trials Of Marshall Hall'' and ''Sensational British Trials''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.suttonelms.org.uk/jmortimer.html |work=Diversity Website Radio Drama |author=Deacon, Nigel |title=John Mortimer Radio Plays |date=2012 |access-date=20 October 2021}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Mortimer in 1949 married Penelope Fletcher as her second husband, later better known as [[Penelope Mortimer]]. They had a son, [[Jeremy Mortimer]], and a daughter, Sally Silverman.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/oct/22/guardianobituaries1 Obituary: Penelope Ruth Mortimer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114153940/http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/1999/oct/22/guardianobituaries1 |date=14 November 2012}}, 1999.</ref> The unstable marriage inspired work by both writers, of which Penelope's novel, ''[[The Pumpkin Eater]]'' (1962), later made into a [[The Pumpkin Eater|film of the same name]], is best known. The couple divorced in 1971 and he married Penelope Gollop in 1972. They had two daughters, [[Emily Mortimer]] (1971), and Rosie Mortimer (1984). He and his second wife lived in the [[Buckinghamshire]] village of [[Turville Heath]]. The split with his first wife had been bitter, but they were on friendly terms by the time of her death in 1999.<ref name="Indie"/>

In September 2004, the ''Sunday Telegraph'' journalist Tim Walker revealed the existence of a second son to Mortimer, Ross Bentley, who had been conceived during a secret affair Mortimer pursued with the English actress [[Wendy Craig]] more than 40 years before and born in November 1961.<ref name="Indie2">John Walsh [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/wit-flirt-genius-john-mortimer-dies-aged-85-1418233.html "Wit, flirt, genius: John Mortimer dies aged 85"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506221328/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/wit-flirt-genius-john-mortimer-dies-aged-85-1418233.html |date=6 May 2016}}, ''The Independent'', 17 January 2009</ref><ref name="Times1"/> Craig and Mortimer had met when the actress had been cast playing a pregnant woman in Mortimer's first full-length [[West End theatre|West End]] play, ''The Wrong Side of the Park''. Ross Bentley was raised by Craig and her husband, [[Jack Bentley (musician)|Jack Bentley]], the show business writer and musician.

In Mortimer's memoirs, ''Clinging to the Wreckage'', he wrote of "enjoying my mid-thirties and all the pleasures which come to a young writer."

==Honours==
Awarded a [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in 1986, he was [[Knight bachelor|knighted]] in 1998.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/jan/16/mortimer-rumpole-dies-obituary |title=Obituary: Sir John Mortimer |newspaper=The Guardian |date=16 January 2009 |last1=Robertson |first1=Geoffrey}}</ref>

==Death==
Mortimer suffered a [[stroke]] in October 2008 and died on 16 January 2009, aged 85.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120912175427/http://www.lastingtribute.co.uk/tribute/mortimer/2998415] John Mortimer – Lasting Tribute {{dead link |date=June 2016 |bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} New link: [https://funeral-notices.co.uk/national/death-notices/notice/Sir+John+Mortimer/1980036 The obituary notice of SIR JOHN MORTIMER] 16/01/2009 ''funeral-notices.co.uk'', accessed 2 November 2020.</ref>
