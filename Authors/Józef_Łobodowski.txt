'''Józef Stanisław Łobodowski''' (born 1909, Pruwiszki – died 1988 [[Madrid]]) was a [[Polish literature|Polish]] poet and [[Political philosophy|political thinker]].

His poetic works are broadly divided into two distinct phases: the earlier one, until about 1934, in which he was sometimes identified as "the last of the [[Skamander|Skamandrites]]",<ref>By [[Wacław Iwaniuk]], who called him "ostatni skamandryta"; cited in: Jadwiga Sawicka, ''Wołyń poetycki w przestrzeni kresowej'', [[Warsaw]], DiG, 1999, p.&nbsp;55. {{ISBN|837181030X}}.</ref> and the second phase beginning about 1935, marked by the pessimistic and tragic colouring associated with the newly nascent current in Polish poetry known as ''[[:pl:Katastrofizm (kultura)|katastrofizm]]'' (catastrophism).  The evolution of his political thought, from the [[Far-left politics|radical left]] to radical [[anticommunism]], broadly paralleled the trajectory of his poetic ''oeuvre''.

To the contemporary reading public  Łobodowski was also known as the founder and [[Editor-in-chief|editor]] of several [[avant-garde]] [[Literary magazine|literary periodicals]], of a [[daily newspaper|newspaper]], translator, novelist, prose writer in the Polish and Spanish languages, radio personality, and preeminently a prolific [[Opinion journalism|opinion writer]] with sharply defined political views active before, during and after the [[Second World War]] in the Polish press (since 1940 only in the [[émigré]] press). Łobodowski described himself as a [[Ukrainophilia|Ukrainophile]] and devoted three of his books to [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] themes, including two collections of poetry (''[[#Works|Pieśń o Ukrainie]]'' and ''[[#Works|Złota hramota]]'').<ref>[[Wacław Iwaniuk]], ''Ostatni romantyk: wspomnienie o Józefie Łobodowskim'' (The ''Archiwum Emigracji: studia, szkice, dokumenty'' series, ed.

== Life and work ==

=== Early life ===

Łobodowski was born on 19 March 1909 in the lands of [[Russian partition|Partitioned Poland]] on the (relatively modest) Purwiszki farmstead of his father, Władysław Łobodowski, a [[History of Russian military ranks#1722-1917|colonel]] in the [[Imperial Russian Army]], and his wife Stefanja Łobodowska, ''née'' Doborejko-Jarząbkiewicz.  Of the Łobodowskis' four children {{mdash}} three daughters and one son {{mdash}} two daughters died in childhood, leaving Józef and his surviving (elder) sister Władysława.<ref>[http://www.monitor-press.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=86:-lr&Itemid=177&lang=pl Adam Tomanek (Łobodowski's nephew), "Polski redaktor tygodnika 'Wołyń'", ''Monitor Wołyński'', 2009.]</ref> In 1910 the Łobodowskis were obliged to sell their country estate and moved to [[Lublin]].  In 1914, owing to the outbreak of the [[First World War]], Władysław Łobodowski was transferred together with his family to Moscow as a measure taken by the Imperial Russian Army to shield its [[officer corps]] from the hostilities of war.  It is to this period of his early schooling in Moscow that Łobodowski owed his excellent knowledge of the [[Russian language]].  However, the upheavals of the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] of 1917 soon forced the family to flee for their lives to [[Yeysk]] in the [[Kuban]] region of the [[Ciscaucasia]], where {{mdash}} drastically reduced in their means {{mdash}} they suffered severe privations for five years, including hunger.  In this place and in these conditions Łobodowski passed the for&shy;ma&shy;tive years of his life between the ages of 8 and 13, at times forced by circumstances into wheeling and dealing in the town's streets to help the family survive.  The name "[[Kuban]]", as a reference to the broadly conceived world of the [[Kuban Cossacks]], crops up in all discussions of Łobodowski's life and creative ''oeuvre'' as the single most sig&shy;nif&shy;i&shy;cant [[toponym]] of his entire biography.  The Kuban period will be fictionalized in his 1955 novel ''[[#Prose|Komysze]]'' ("The Bushmen"), a text which paints a faithful and seductively vivid picture of the last months of freedom and decadence in Russia in a secluded port in the [[Kuban River#Geography and hydrology|Zakubanskie Marshes]] on the [[Sea of Azov]].<ref>So Czesław Jeśman, "W kubańskiej pustyni i puszczy" (In [[Kuban]] Desert and Wilderness), ''Wiadomości Literackie'' (London), No.&nbsp;16 (524), 1956, p.&nbsp;4.  The title of the article, "In [[Kuban]] Desert and Wilderness", is a [[word play]] on the title of [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]]'s novel, ''[[In Desert and Wilderness]]'' (1911).</ref> It is also here, in the Kuban, that Łobo&shy;dow&shy;ski first came in contact with Ukrainian culture, owing to the presence in the region of the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]] who had been resettled there after the banning of the [[Zaporizhian Sich]] by [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] in 1775.<ref>Józef Łobodowski's letter of January 1988 to Jadwiga Sawicka; quoted in: Jadwiga Sawicka, "Hellada scytyjska: Ukraina w poezji Józefa Łobodowskiego", ''Więź'', Nos.&nbsp;11{{ndash}}12, 1988. [http://biblioteka.teatrnn.pl/dlibra/dlibra/doccontent?id=10628 (See online.)]</ref>
However, the Kuban, and Yeysk in particular did not prove a safe haven for the family, and here his father, Władysław Łobodowski, was at last arrested by the [[Bolsheviks]]: although eventually released through the intervention of a former comrade-in-arms from the Imperial Russian Army who had crossed over the new ideological divide, he died there of natural causes on 4 March 1922 and is buried in town.  Thereupon Łobodowski's mother, Stefanja Łobodowska, decided to take her three surviving children (one daughter had already died earlier) to the nascent [[Second Polish Republic]], a long and perilous journey which claimed the life of another of her children, a second daughter, hurriedly buried along the way in an unmarked grave.<ref name="tnn" /> Thus reduced in numbers and deprived of means of support, the family settled once again in [[Lublin]], in an establishment owned by Stefanja Łobodowska's stepsister, Łobodowski's aunt.

=== Youth and the early period as a poet ===

The city of Lublin (now in independent Poland) was thus to become the centre of his youth, and here Łobodowski spent his tumultuous high-school years which saw his first forays into poetry, encouraged by the poet [[Julian Tuwim]], soon to become the dominant preoccupation of his life.  In the first years of his life as a poet his sympathies lay with the so-called [[Second Avant-garde]] (''[[:pl:Druga Awangarda (literatura)|Druga Awangarda]]'') movement centred round the poet [[Józef Czechowicz]] and his circle, whose style was characterized by visionary catastrophism mediated by [[Expressionism]], although the [[Writer's voice|personal idiom]] Łobodowski developed was distinctively and unmistakably his own.<ref>Irena Szypowska, "Łobodowski {{mdash}} poeta świadomy dziejów", ''Rocznik Towarzystwa Literackiego imienia Adama Mickiewicza'', vol.&nbsp;38, [[Łódź]], Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe, 2004, p.&nbsp;20.</ref> One of the first compositions published by Łobodowski was the poem "Dlaczego" (Why?) which appeared in May 1928 in the bimonthly magazine ''[[W Słońce|W&nbsp;Słońce]]'' which he co-edited and which also carried in its first issue the article of a 19-year-old Łobodowski on the nature of poetry in general as the art of the unsayable, and some other of his poems.<ref>Józef Łobodowski, "Sztuka... poezja..." (On Art and Poetry), ''[[W Słońce|W&nbsp;Słońce]]'' ([[Lublin]]), vol.&nbsp;1, No.&nbsp;1, [1 May 1928], pp.&nbsp;1{{ndash}}4. ''[[Id.]]'', "Dlaczego" (Why?), ''[[ibid.]]'', p.&nbsp;4. ''[[Id.]]'', "Trzy śmierci" (Three Deaths), ''[[ibid.]]'', p.&nbsp;8. [http://biblioteka.teatrnn.pl/dlibra/dlibra/doccontent?id=10106 (See online.)]</ref> His début in book form in 1929, at the age of&nbsp;20, was the collection of poems entitled ''Słońce przez szpary'' ("Sunshine through the Cracks").  This was followed by the volume entitled ''Gwiezdny psałterz'' ("Astral Psaltery") released in the autumn of 1931, whose programmatic poem "Poezja" (Poetry) is dedicated to [[Julian Tuwim]] in obvious ac&shy;knowl&shy;edge&shy;ment of his indebtedness to the [[Skamander]] circle.<ref name="ArturHutnikiewicz">Artur Hutnikiewicz & Andrzej Lam, eds., ''Literatura polska XX wieku: przewodnik encyklopedyczny'', [[Warsaw]], Wydawnictwo Naukowe PWN, 2000, p.&nbsp;396.  {{ISBN|8301130288}}.</ref> However, another poem in the collection, "Hymn brzucha" (The Hymn of the Belly), in which reverberate the echos of the terrible period of hunger experienced in Yeysk in 1917{{ndash}}1922, will mark the beginning, stylistically, of a post-Skamander stage in Łobodowski's creative journey.<ref>Cf. Irena Szypowska (see [[#Bibliography|Bibliography]]), pp.&nbsp;25{{ndash}}27.</ref> These early volumes largely escaped the notice of the literary establishment at the time.

==== ''On the Red Colour of Blood'' and other colours ====

Łobodowski began to draw attention with his third collection of poetry on account of the controversy it caused.  The controversy stemmed principally from the fact that the newly independent Poland was not a fully democratic country with unfettered freedom of speech, but constituted instead an environment in which the ostensibly "[[Left-wing politics|leftist]]" ideology he espoused early in his life as a vehicle for his [[social criticism|nonconformist ideas]] was treated with suspicion.  The entire print run of ''O&nbsp;czerwonej krwi'' ("On the [[Red (political adjective)#Use by political movements|Red Colour]] of Blood"), his third collection of poems published in January 1932 expressing revolt against the prevailing standards of morality and challenging all authority, was seized by the authorities and criminal pro&shy;ceed&shy;ings were instituted against Łobodowski as the author.<ref>Irena Szypowska, "Łobodowski {{mdash}} poeta świadomy dziejów" (Łobodowski: A Poet Cognizant of History), ''Rocznik Towarzystwa Literackiego imienia Adama Mickiewicza'', vol.&nbsp;38, [[Łódź]], Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe, 2004, p.&nbsp;18.</ref> Although the protracted court case ended, on appeal, with mere confiscation of all the copies of the book and no fines or imprisonment were imposed, the affair had damaging consequences for Łobodowski since {{mdash}} as it coincided with the commencement of his studies in the Faculty of Law of the [[John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin|Catholic University of Lublin]] in 1931 {{mdash}} he was promptly expelled from the university in February 1932, at the beginning of the second semester of the first year and, for good measure, blacklisted by all institutions of higher education in Poland "for the propagation of pornography and [[blasphemy]] through poetical works".<ref>[[Józef Kruszyński]] (1877{{ndash}}1953), the notorious theoretician of [[antisemitism]] and [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the [[John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin|Catholic University of Lublin]] (see [[:pl:Józef Kruszyński|Józef Kruszyński]]), wrote to all the rectors of Polish universities a letter dated 17 February 1932, which stated in part:

<blockquote>I have the honour [''[[sic]]''] to inform you that... Józef Łobodowski, by the decision of the [University] Senate of 5&nbsp;February 1932, was sent down from the University for propagating pornography and blasphemy [''[[sic]]'': ''za szerzenie pornografji i bluźnierstwa''] through the poetic works published by himself, which had been confiscated by the prosecutor's deputies. [http://biblioteka.teatrnn.pl/dlibra/Content/16410/200903161459300.archKUL2.jpg (See facsimile online.)]</blockquote>

56&nbsp;years and 8&nbsp;months after the event, on 22 October 1988, a [[Requiem|memorial mass]] will be celebrated for the "por&shy;nog&shy;ra&shy;pher and blasphemer" Łobodowski at the [[John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin|University]] church: see ''Słownik biograficzny miasta Lublina'', vol.&nbsp;1, ed. T.&nbsp;Radzik, ''et al.'', [[Lublin]], Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu Marii Curie-Skłodowskiej, 1993, ''[[s.v.]]''&nbsp;"Łobodowski".  {{ISBN|8322705646}}.  And in the year following his death, 1989, the University's own Press will publish a collection of Łobodowski's verses: Józef Łobodowski, ''List do kraju'', comp. & ed. J.&nbsp;Święch, [[Lublin]], Redakcja Wydawnictw [[John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin|Katolickiego Uniwersytetu Lubelskiego]], 1989. {{ISBN|8322801645}}.</ref>

Łobodowski responded defiantly by releasing another collection of poetry later the same year under the title ''W&nbsp;przeddzień'' ("On the Eve"), his fourth book which included the title poem "W&nbsp;przeddzień" (On the Eve) incorporating the following three lines addressed to the Polish dictator [[Józef Piłsudski|First Marshal Piłsudski]] (who had earlier [[Józef Piłsudski#After the coup|called]] his ''[[May Coup (Poland)|coup d'état]]'' a "revolution", and who is referenced in the poem by name):
<blockquote><poem>
''towarzyszu Piłsudski,''
''<tt>w przeddzień</tt> polskiej rewolucji''
''krwią wasze imię wypisujemy na tarczach...''

This book, which appeared towards the end of June 1932 in a print run of 100 copies, was placed under an interdict by the local authorities in [[Lublin]] on 2 July 1932; the interdict was however lifted by the decision of the [[Lublin]] [[district court]] just eleven days later.<ref>Józef Zięba (see [[#Bibliography|Bibliography]]), No.&nbsp;6 (89), p.&nbsp;4.</ref> The authorities evidently considered it wise to ignore the challenge this time round to avoid giving Łobodowski the benefit of extra publicity, his star having risen markedly since he had been stamped with the hallmark of a "confiscated poet" the last time.  Indeed, thrust into the public spotlight with the ''O&nbsp;czerwonej krwi'' affair of March 1932, with his books suddenly an object of attention, Łobodowski started billing his previously released (but unsold) volume ''Gwiezdny psałterz'' as now still ''forthcoming'' in newspaper notices intended to capitalize on the newly found wave of popularity with this title, too.<ref>''Trybuna: pismo młodej demokracji...'' ([[Lublin]]), vol.&nbsp;1, No.&nbsp;1, 1 March 1932.  Łobodowski was editor-in-chief on the first five issues of the periodical.</ref>
On the other hand, the individual poem entitled "Słowo do prokuratora" (A Word to the Prosecutor), published separately in the ''Trybuna'' in March 1932, a [[literary magazine|literary journal]] of which he was for a time the editor-in-chief, will be the cause of another court case against him in 1933.<ref>''Pamiętnik literacki: czasopismo kwartalne poświęcone historii i krytyce literatury polskiej'', vol.&nbsp;57, Nos. 1{{ndash}}2, [[Wrocław]], Zakład im. Ossolińskich, 1966, p.&nbsp;564.</ref> This time in addition to the usual charges of subversive publications will be added the charges of contacts with the [[Communist Party of Poland]]: Łobodowski will be acquitted only on appeal in a [[Warsaw]] court in October 1933.<ref>Marek Zaleski (see [[#Bibliography|Bibliography]]).</ref> For all the exertions of the [[Sanacja]] régime against him as a communist subversive, Łobodowski's leftist stance was to a significant extent superficial, adopted as an expedient by an angry young man to transmit his ideas of rebellion against reality, ''[[tout court]]'' (and was soon to be abandoned of his own accord for other forms of poetic discourse better suited to his evolving perception of human condition).  Some critics have used the adjective ''światoburczy'' to describe the nature of Łobodowski's political writings, a partly jocose word whose meaning is a blend of such concepts as iconoclasm, radicalism, and dissatisfaction with the ''status quo'' (''welterschütternd'' in German).<ref>[Anonymous article], "Trybuna" (The Tribune), ''[[Kurjer Lubelski]]'' ([[Lublin]]), vol.&nbsp;10, No.&nbsp;64, 4 March 1932, p.&nbsp;3.</ref>
The evidence of how seriously Łobodowski was taken as a political commentator at this time can on the other hand be illustrated by the fact that, at the age of&nbsp;23, he could print opinion pieces on the ''first page'' of the premier daily newspaper of a major Polish city (the ''[[Kurjer Lubelski]]'' of Lublin) with such headlines as "[[#Selected opinion journalism|What You Need is a Suicide]]" (a title he used in an article stressing the need for the Polish society to free itself from the old entrenched modes of thought).<ref>Józef Łobodowski, "Potrzebne jest samobójstwo" (What You Need is a Suicide), ''[[Kurjer Lubelski]]'' ([[Lublin]]), vol.&nbsp;10, No.&nbsp;294, 25 October 1932, p.&nbsp;1.</ref> There is evidence that Łobodowski, even at this particular period of his life, held in contempt those who {{mdash}} like [[Jerzy Putrament]] {{mdash}} admired him for his leftist leanings rather than his poetical craftsmanship.<ref>[[Jerzy Putrament]], ''Pół wieku'', [[Warsaw]], Wydawnictwo Ministerstwa Obrony Narodowej, 1961, p.&nbsp;218.  Cf. Tadeusz Kłak, ''Stolik Tadeusza Peipera: o strategiach awangardy'', [[Cracow]], Oficyna Literacka, 1993, p.&nbsp;140.  {{ISBN|8385158928}}.</ref> [[Józef Czechowicz]], the leading light of the Lublin avant-garde, went so far (in a private letter) as to express the opinion that Łobodowski deliberately fostered around himself an atmosphere of sensation and scandal in which to move his wings, and that not only in the political sphere but in the literary and social domains as well.<ref>[[Józef Czechowicz]], ''Listy'', ed. T.&nbsp;Kłak, [[Lublin]], Wydawnictwo Lubelskie, 1977, p.&nbsp;220, n.&nbsp;19.</ref> Despite the wide publicity his first four volumes of poetry had received, Łobodowski himself considered his output up to this point "unoriginal".<ref>Irena Szypowska, "Łobodowski {{mdash}} poeta świadomy dziejów", ''Rocznik Towarzystwa Literackiego imienia Adama Mickiewicza'', vol.&nbsp;38, [[Łódź]], Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe, 2004, p.&nbsp;19.</ref>
Łobodowski was twice the editor-in-chief of the ''[[Kurjer Lubelski]]'', one of the most important [[daily newspaper]]s of the [[interbellum]] Poland, in 1932 and 1937.  Upon assuming the office of the editor in 1932 he promptly published the article "Why the Work of the Opposition is Harmful", arguing that the fight with the [[Sanacja]] system had been hijacked by other equally distasteful political groupings making the whole exercise of the political opposition [[Mootness|moot]] and suspect.<ref>Józef Łobodowski, "Dlaczego działalność opozycji jest szkodliwa" (Why the Work of the Opposition is Harmful), ''[[Kurjer Lubelski]]'' ([[Lublin]]), vol.&nbsp;10, No.&nbsp;291, 22 October 1932, p.&nbsp;1.  [http://biblioteka.teatrnn.pl/dlibra/dlibra/doccontent?id=42283 (See online.)]</ref> In its so-called [[Kurjer Lubelski#Phase V|Fifth Phase]] in 1937, after his own ideological turnabout, he attempted to revive the broadsheet on [[Prometheism|Promethean]] lines, that is to say to make it unabashedly an organ "of the struggle to dismember the [[Evil Empire speech|Russian{{ndash}}Soviet empire]] into its constituent parts".<ref>Józef Łobodowski, "Fragmenty wspomnień" (Scraps of Memory), ''Kontakt: miesięcznik redagowany przez członków i współpracowników [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|NSZZ Solidarność]]'' (Paris), No.&nbsp;10, 1987, p.&nbsp;59.</ref>

=== Turnabout in ideology and poetics ===

==== Suicide attempt ====

During the [[military service]] he was performing at a reserve officers' cadet school (''[[:pl:Szkoła Podchorążych Rezerwy|szkoła podchorążych rezerwy]]'') in the Polish town of [[Rivne|Równe]] in the [[Volhynia]] in 1933{{ndash}}1934 Łobodowski made an unsuccessful attempt on his life by shooting himself. The act was witnessed by others. He was hospitalized, and in the aftermath of the incident arrested (10 March 1934) on charges of possessing "leftist propaganda" (that apparently meant his own poems in manuscript, which were found during a search of his belongings performed in his absence) and placed in military prison for three weeks.<ref>Józef Łobodowski, "Adwokatka heroizmu" (The Prophetess of Heroism), ''[[Wiadomości Literackie]]'' (see ''[[:pl:Wiadomości Literackie|Wiadomości Literackie]]'') ([[Warsaw]]), vol.&nbsp;12, No.&nbsp;48 (628), 1 December 1935, p.&nbsp;7.</ref> The intervention of his literary friends who mobilized some of the greatest names in Polish literature on his behalf, including the well-connected writer [[Kazimiera Iłłakowiczówna]] (1892{{ndash}}1983) but also [[Ewa Szelburg-Zarembina]] (1899{{ndash}}1986) and others, was in&shy;stru&shy;men&shy;tal in bringing about his release from jail and in making the whole affair die a sudden death without a [[court martial]] or other long-lasting adverse consequences for Łobodowski.<ref>[[:pl:Kazimiera Iłłakowiczówna|Kazimiera Iłłakowiczówna]], the ''[[grande dame]]'' of Polish literature then at the height of her career ("literary and other&shy;wise", as she puts it), recalls in her [[memoirs]] being approached by some of Łobodowski's friends with the request to intercede on his behalf before the authorities in order to get him out of "the military clink" where he was put away "for com&shy;mu&shy;nism and attempted suicide". One of the most famous Polish writers of the 20th century, Iłła&shy;ko&shy;wi&shy;czówna was also employed at the time as private secretary to the Polish strong&shy;man, [[Józef Piłsudski|General Piłsudski]].  Her preliminary in&shy;quiries revealed that Łobodowski had a case of [[sedition]] registered against him "already in high school". While performing his military service, to make the point of unfamiliarity with firearms, he apparently shot the wrong way, ''towards'' himself, receiving wounds that required hospitalization.  In the ensuing investigation, a search of his room revealed leftist literature on the premises, to wit, "communist verses" in manuscript and "subversive letters" written to friends.  He was to be prosecuted on his leaving the hospital.  Thus apprised of the situation but unsure how to proceed, Iłła&shy;ko&shy;wi&shy;czówna accidentally ran ("in a doorway at work") into the general responsible for the area of the country in which Łobodowski was held, and recognizing her opportunity she instantaneously set upon him "with all the superior might of female fury", impressing upon him that he would pass into the annals of history as a subverter of Polish culture, eternally held up to ridicule like so many other "petty satraps" before him "who rolled out heavy artillery against but&shy;ter&shy;flies".  "My dear lady {{mdash}} responded the general curtly {{mdash}} the feller (''facet'') is first and foremost a [[malingerer]]: if he really wanted to shoot himself dead, he would have chosen [a gun of] a bigger calibre... He is not in the clink with us... In any case, this is a matter for the prosecutor, not me...", and he trotted off into the distance down the corridor.  The next thing Iłła&shy;ko&shy;wi&shy;czówna knew, Łobodowski was appearing before her with thanks.  He received with in&shy;dig&shy;na&shy;tion the news that he was being suspected of malingering, telling her, "Too small a calibre? That's a good one on me all right! Was I supposed to use a [[cannon]] or something? (...) I have shrapnel all over me inside..."  She then decided to probe delicately into the motives behind the attempted suicide: "Have they mistreated you in any way during your service?"  Łobodowski's explanation (which she received with "total shock") was that the reason lay in disappointed love. Iłła&shy;ko&shy;wi&shy;czówna ends this chapter of her memoirs by observing that in this particular instance, no legal pro&shy;ceed&shy;ings ("of any kind", she stresses) were instituted against Łobodowski. See [[Kazimiera Iłłakowiczówna]], "Dziwny ''casus'' Józefa Ł." (The Strange Case of Józef Ł.); in ''[[id.]]'', ''Trazymeński zając: księga dygresji'', [[Cracow]], Wydawnictwo Literackie, 1968, pp.&nbsp;91{{ndash}}93.</ref> Łobodowski's explanation of the reasons for his suicide attempt given sub&shy;se&shy;quent&shy;ly to Iłła&shy;ko&shy;wi&shy;czówna and reported in her memoirs as attributable to disappointed love (presumably for [[Zuzanna Ginczanka]]) has been treated with scepticism by critical opinion since its publication in 1968.  While Łobodowski avoided the subject throughout the rest of his life, a set of more complex reasons concerning the ideological turmoil he was in at the time are nowadays credited as the real cause of the dramatic act he resorted to.<ref>Jacek Trznadel, "O Józefie Łobodowskim", ''Arka'' ([[Warsaw]]), No.&nbsp;50, 1994, pp.&nbsp;104{{ndash}}111.

Following the military affair at Równe, Łobodowski moved to [[Warsaw]] in May 1934.<ref>Irena Szypowska (see [[#Bibliography|Bibliography]]), p.&nbsp;56.</ref>

==== Polemics with Wasilewska ====

During this period Łobodowski changed some of his political views, a fact which is signalled most dramatically in his polemical exchanges with [[Wanda Wasilewska]], a writer of a staunch communist, pro-[[Soviet]], [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] stance that she will maintain unshaken even in the face of the Soviet Union's (later) alliance with Hitler and their joint attack on Poland at the beginning of the Second World War.  In an article published in 1935 in the most prestigious literary periodical in Poland at the time, the ''[[Wiadomości Literackie]]'' weekly {{mdash}} as part of his ongoing war of words with Wasilewska {{mdash}} Łobodowski made the following statement which posits [[self-criticism]] as the essential element of [[moral courage]], and which thus holds special significance for this period of his ideological transition and the whole rest of his life:

{{quote|A distinction must be made between on the one hand a heroism of life, which consists in a determined fight [for one's ideals] and the rejection of all compromise, and on the other hand a heroism of mind that has no fear of criticism and of a continuous reappraisal of its primary assumptions. It often so happens that people who bravely go to jail for many years for their beliefs lack the courage to admit before themselves that their sacrifice may be useless {{mdash}} or worse, misguided, being offered in the wrong cause.  In this sense many a hero or revolutionary is a retrograde intellectual coward.  I&nbsp;doubt it whether Ms.&nbsp;Wasilewska {{mdash}} who in her novels has given us a striking example of the crudity to which facile ideologies can lead {{mdash}} whether she understands this distinction.|from "The [[Prophetess]] of Heroism", ''[[Wiadomości Literackie]]'', 1 December 1935.<ref>Józef Łobodowski, "Adwokatka heroizmu" (The Prophetess of Heroism), ''[[Wiadomości Literackie]]'' (see ''[[:pl:Wiadomości Literackie|Wiadomości Literackie]]'') ([[Warsaw]]), vol.&nbsp;12, No.&nbsp;48 (628), 1 December 1935, p.&nbsp;7.  Original text in Polish:<blockquote>Trzeba też odróżnić heroizm życiowy, polegający na bojowej niezłomności i odrzuceniu wszelkiego kompromisu, od heroizmu myśli, nie lękającej się nieustannej krytyki i rewizji własnych założeń. Często ludzie, którzy idą śmiało na wiele lat do więzienia, nie mają odwagi przyznać się przed samymi sobą, że ich poświęcenie jest bezużyteczne albo co gorsza, służy złej sprawie. W tym sensie nie jeden bohater i rewolucjonista jest intelektualnym tchórzem i wstecznikiem. Wątpię, czy p.&nbsp;Wasilewska, która w swoich powieściach dała jaskrawy przykład, do jakiego prostactwa dopro&shy;wa&shy;dzi&shy;ła ułatwiona ideologja, zrozumie to rozróżnienie.</blockquote></ref>}}

==== New direction in poetry ====

Critical acclaim and wide recognition as an important voice in literature brought him the collections of poetry ''Rozmowa z ojczyzną'' ("A Conversation with the Fatherland"; 1935; 2nd ed., corr. & enl., 1936), much appreciated by [[Zuzanna Ginczanka]], and ''Demonom nocy'' ("To the Demons of the Night"; 1936), which won him a coveted prize of the [[Polish Academy of Literature]] in 1937 but in private was sharply criticized by Ginczanka.<ref name="ArturHutnikiewicz" /><ref>Józef Łobodowski, ''Demonom nocy'', [[Warsaw]], Księgarnia F. Hoesicka, 1936 (85&nbsp;pp.). On the reception of the two volumes by [[Zuzanna Ginczanka|Ginczanka]], see Józef Łobodowski, ''Pamięci Sulamity'', [[Toronto]], Polski Fundusz Wydawniczy w Kanadzie, 1987, p.&nbsp;11.</ref> The general adulation showered on him by both the reading public and the critics was tempered by the dissenting voice of [[:pl:Ignacy Fik|Ignacy Fik]] who wrote of Łobodowski ''[[Ad hominem|ad personam]]'' as "a character most alien to the Polish psyche, a pagan [[Scythians|Scythian]], a [[Romanticism|Romantic]] shot through with [[anarchism]] and [[nihilism]], an expansive Russian nature whose longings for his [[Marzanna]] are inspired by boredom.  And where Łobodowski ends, [[Czesław Miłosz|[Czesław] Miłosz]] takes over...".<ref>[[Ignacy Fik]], ''20 lat literatury polskiej (1918{{ndash}}1938)'', [[Cracow]], Spółdzielnia Wydawnicza Czytelnik, 1939, p.&nbsp;84; 2nd&nbsp;ed., [[Cracow]], Spółdzielnia Pracy i Użytkowników "Placówka", 1949, p.&nbsp;91.</ref> Another carping critic, [[:pl:Ludwik Fryde|Ludwik Fryde]], for his part, accused Łobodowski of "actorship, playacting".<ref>''Życie Literackie'', No.&nbsp;2, 1937.  Cited in: Ludwik Fryde, ''Wybór pism krytycznych'', ed. A.&nbsp;Biernacki, [[Warsaw]], Państwowy Instytut Wydawniczy, 1966, p.&nbsp;206.</ref> However, by 1937 such barbs served as a confirmation of Łobodowski's presence in the public spotlight with his firmly established fame.  It has been observed that the latter works for the first time sound a note {{mdash}} from now on to be the characteristic theme of Łobodowski's ''oeuvre'' {{mdash}} of tragic pessimism which has been seen by scholars to have its source in the dramatic confrontation between the powers of ''[[élan vital]]'' and biology on the one hand, and those of culture and ideology on the other.<ref name="ArturHutnikiewicz" /> [[Tymon Terlecki]] (1905{{ndash}}2000), one of the most astute Polish critics, wrote in 1937 that inasmuch as Łobodowski was difficult of classification in general he did not fit easily within the cultural parameters of ''any'' known literary tradition.<ref name="TT">[[Tymon Terlecki]] (see [[#Bibliography|Bibliography]]). (See also [[:pl:Tymon Terlecki|Tymon Terlecki]].)</ref>

The collection ''Rozmowa z ojczyzną'' ("A Conversation with the Fatherland"), like the previous book ''W&nbsp;przeddzień'' ("On the Eve") of 1932, contains an ''[[engagé]]'' poem dealing with the Polish dictator [[Józef Piłsudski|First Marshal Piłsudski]].  Indeed, in this case, the name of Piłsudski is not merely incorporated into the body of the text but constitutes the very title of the 6-stanza, 25-line poem "Piłsudski".<ref>Józef Łobodowski, "Piłsudski"; in ''[[id.]]'', ''Rozmowa z ojczyzną'', 2nd ed., corr. & enl., [[Warsaw]], Księgarnia F. Hoesicka, 1936, p.&nbsp;19.</ref>

=== Marriage with Jadwiga Kuryłło ===
On March 1, 1938, Józef Łobodowski married Jadwiga Kuryłło at St. John the Baptist Cathedral in Lublin. Depside what Jadwiga's surname might suggest, she was born to a rooted Polish Roman Catholic family. At the time of marriage, Józef was 29 and Jadwiga 26, but they had started their relationship when Jadwiga was still in high school. They became separated when WWII broke up in 1939. Due to the postwar communist reality in Poland, which Józef Łobodowski actively opposed from abroad, they had no contact after the war. Jadwiga divorced Józef on April 9, 1950, just before she remarried. When they were together, Jadwiga participated in Józef's work. After they became separated, Jadwiga tried to preserve Józef's work that she had managed to gather, but most of that was confiscated by Germans. She donated the remaining pieces to the Lublin Museum after the war.

=== Relationship with Zuzanna Ginczanka ===

Józef Łobodowski had a relationship with a [[Jewish]] poet [[Zuzanna Ginczanka]]. That was opposed by his mother and his sister. Łobodowski first met Zuzanna Ginczanka {{mdash}} in his words, "a precociously mature woman... with eyes scintillating like the vast expanse of the sea shimmering in the sun" {{mdash}} at the multicultural Polish locality of [[Rivne|Równe]] in [[Volhynia]] (now within the borders of the [[Ukraine]]), where he had the uncommon good fortune to have been performing his [[military service]] in the autumn of 1933, when Ginczanka was 16 and he 24. When Józef married Jadwiga Kuryłło, Zuzanna ended the relationship. After the War, while living in [[Madrid]], Łobodowski would receive a small parcel posted from [[Pamplona]] containing the gift of a golden diamond-studded [[tie pin]], with a small note skewered on it, which read: "From the mother of Zuzanna".<ref>Józef Łobodowski, ''Pamięci Sulamity'', [[Toronto]], Polski Fundusz Wydawniczy w Kanadzie, 1987, p.&nbsp;15.</ref> What remains for posterity is the extraordinary volume of understated erotic lyrics modelled stylistically on the ''[[Song of Songs]]'', with an introduction important for historical reasons, which Łobodowski will dedicate to Ginczanka posthumously late in his own life (at the age of 78): his collection ''Pamięci Sulamity'' ("In Remembrance of the [[Shulamite]] [[Shulammite Woman|Woman]]"),<ref>Józef Łobodowski, ''Pamięci Sulamity'', [[Toronto]], Polski Fundusz Wydawniczy w Kanadzie, 1987. (64&nbsp;pp.)</ref> brimming as it is with love for Ginczanka undimmed by the passage of time.<ref>Cf. Noelia Román, "Camino de peregrinación: de Lublin a Madrid.

=== Second World War ===

During the last few years preceding the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] Łobodowski lived in [[Lutsk|Łuck]], in what was then [[Poland]], moving to [[Warsaw]] in April 1938 after his marriage.  He was called up in August 1939, a few days before the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], and saw action during the [[Invasion of Poland|September Campaign]] in [[Wiśnicz]], [[Łańcut]], and several other places, including a locality known as [[Dubliany|Dublany]] (then in Poland, now in the Ukraine), which he memorialized in the poem entitled "Dublany" (first published in France in 1941).<ref>In: Józef Łobodowski, ''Z dymem pożarów'', [[Nice]], Oficyna Tyszkiewicza, 1941, pp.&nbsp;24{{ndash}}29.</ref> After the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] on 17 September 1939, while waiting with the remnants of his [[10th Motorized Cavalry Brigade (Poland)|brigade]] at [[Tatarów]] (now Tatariv in the Ukraine) to cross the border into [[Hungary]], he wrote the memorable lines of the "Noc nad granicą" (A Night on the Frontier).  The next day, 19 September 1939, they crossed the Polish border through the [[Yablonitsky Pass]]: this was the moment Łobodowski would leave his homeland for ever.  The veterans of his unit were [[interned]] in various places throughout the territory of Hungary, Łobodowski ending up at first at a camp at [[Tapolca]] near [[Lake Balaton]].  His subsequent wartime peregrinations are not well known; he intended like most men of his [[10th Motorized Cavalry Brigade (Poland)|unit]] to join [[Polish Army in France (1939–1940)|Sikorski's Army in France]], and this intention guided his actions while in Hungarian detention.  After two unsuccessful attempts at escape, he finally managed to flee to [[Yugoslavia]] about a month after arriving in Hungary, eventually reaching Paris on 9 or 10 November 1939.  In Paris Łobodowski encountered the Polish poets [[Jan Lechoń]] and [[Kazimierz Wierzyński]] (who was eager to meet his younger colleague whose fame had preceded him to France), and he began to publish his poems in the émigré press there.

==== On the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and the way of ending the War ====

Łobodowski's first text in prose published in Paris was the full-page political article entitled "On the Soviet{{ndash}}German Alliance" which appeared in March 1940 in the ''[[Wiadomości Polskie, Polityczne i Literackie]]'', a weekly émigré newspaper newly founded by [[Mieczysław Grydzewski]].<ref name="OSSN">Józef Łobodowski, "O sojuszu sowiecko{{ndash}}niemieckim" (On the Soviet{{ndash}}German Alliance), ''[[Wiadomości Polskie, Polityczne i Literackie]]'' (see ''[[:pl:Wiadomości Polskie, Polityczne i Literackie|Wiadomości Polskie, Polityczne i Literackie]]'') (Paris), vol.&nbsp;1, No.&nbsp;1, 17 March 1940, p.&nbsp;6. [http://kpbc.umk.pl/dlibra/publication?id=16675 (See online.)]</ref> The principal thesis of the article was the contention that however unexpected and shocking the [[Treaty of Non-Aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union|collusion between Hitler and Stalin]] in starting the Second World War might have been in the eyes of the world, their compact was in fact predictable.  (He had foretold it himself, he pointed out, in the article published in the ''[[Wiadomości Literackie]]'' of Warsaw on 2 April 1939, fully 4&nbsp;months and 3&nbsp;weeks before the signing of the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], which at the time resulted in the wholesale confiscation by the Polish authorities of the newspaper carrying the article on the grounds that the author was spreading unsubstantiated rumours detrimental to public peace.)<ref>The confiscated issue was ''[[Wiadomości Literackie]]'', vol.&nbsp;16, No.&nbsp;14 (806), 2 April 1939.  This was replaced by another issue substituted for the same date: ''Wiadomości Literackie'', vol.&nbsp;16, No.&nbsp;15 (807), 2 April 1939.</ref> Such precautions against rumours were  predicated on a mistaken view of the [[Soviet Union]] as less noxious than that of [[Nazi Germany]], a view that was based not on facts but on [[wishful thinking]].   Łobodowski wrote that the only way of ending the War quickly in an [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] victory obtained without millions of dead was not by attacking Nazi Germany on the Western Front but by way of an Allied attack on the Soviet Union on the south-eastern front in the region of the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Caucasus]]es. Such an attack on the Soviet Union would be the most effective form of attack on Nazi Germany itself for the simple reason {{mdash}} Łobodowski wrote {{mdash}} that it would ''pre-empt'' Germany's own inevitable transfer of the theatre of war to the region and terminally undermine its capacity to pursue long-term goals (by severing access to natural resources concentrated in the area): but unlike in Europe, a successful outcome for Germany ''there'' {{mdash}} even if successful only partially {{mdash}} would have "incalculable consequences" (enabling Germany to strike at [[British India]], etc.).<ref>Two years later, in July 1942, the unfolding events of the [[Second World War]] will largely bear Łobodowski's theories out: on 28 July 1942 [[Stalin]] will issue a proclamation to the effect that the "existence of the motherland is at stake" during the [[Case Blue#Breaking into the Caucasus|German advance into the Caucasuses]]; cf. [[Bernd Wegner]], "The Offensive into the Caucasus"; in: ''Germany and the Second World War'', ed. Militärgeschichtliches Forschungsamt (Research Institute for Military History), vol.&nbsp;6 (''The Global War''), [[Oxford]], Oxford University Press, 2001, pp.&nbsp;1022{{ndash}}1059, esp. p.&nbsp;1023.  {{ISBN|0198228880}}.</ref> For great wars, concluded Łobodowski, are won only when the ''forces of history'' are allowed to do the fighting for you, with the military operations serving in an ancillary and corrective role to them.<ref name="OSSN" />

==== Arrest in Paris ====

On 20 February 1940 Łobodowski, then aged 30, was arrested by the French police in Paris in circumstances that to this day have not been properly established. The event involved the confiscation of some of his personal effects, including manuscripts, during the search of his hotel room.  Some of these materials have never been returned.  Those materials included anticommunist propaganda leaflets apparently secretly authored by Łobodowski for the [[Polish government-in-exile]] (then based in Paris), which were intended to be dropped from airplanes over the Soviet-occupied parts of Poland for the purpose of fomenting [[subversion]] among the [[Red Army]] {{mdash}} and as such they were the reason for his detention at the [[Cherche-Midi prison|Cherche-Midi military prison]] over a period of some six months after the Polish government minister responsible for ordering the leaflets in question ([[Stanisław Kot|Professor Stanisław Kot]]) denied involvement when interpellated by the French authorities.  Łobodowski will use the scurrilously offensive [[Poetry#Genres|satirical verse]] "Na Profesora Kota" (On Professor Kot) to lampoon the minister in question in his 1954 collection ''Uczta zadżumionych'' ("The Banquet of the Plague-stricken"),<ref>Józef Łobodowski, ''Uczta zadżumionych'', Paris, The Author and Subscribers, 1954, p.&nbsp;109.</ref> calling him again a "cynical swindler" in a parting shot fired one last time towards the end of his life.<ref name="TKII" /> According to Łobodowski's own testimony, he was not released from prison until September 1940, and that only after having been tried ''and'' acquitted by the Supreme Military Court (a circumstance which it will be impossible to verify before the year 2040, as it will be impossible to ascertain the precise nature of the charges he faced).<ref>Owing to the restrictions on the access to military records for 100 years after their creation imposed in France by the Heritage Act (''[[:fr:Code du patrimoine|Code du patrimoine]]''), Article L 213–2.</ref> While the prison experience was a significant and perhaps traumatic event in his life, its silver lining {{mdash}} for the posterity {{mdash}} proved the preservation of his [[police dossier]] containing what appears to be a complete set of his confiscated manuscripts.  The dossier was initially expropriated by the [[Nazism|Nazis]] after the [[Battle of France|invasion of France]] and taken to the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]], where towards the end of the War it fell in its turn into the hands of the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] and was taken to Moscow, there to be repeatedly and assiduously studied during the following years at the Central Military Archives of the USSR ([[:ru:Российский государственный военный архив|Центральный государственный Особый архив СССР]]; as evidenced by the handwritten annotations made in it), until it was finally returned by the [[Russian Federation]] to France in recent years.  (It was found to contain no propaganda leaflets: only Łobodowski's poetry manuscripts and fragments were present, a circumstance explainable by the probability that the leaflets in question may form part of the as yet unopened French military archives instead.)<ref>Paweł Libera, "Aresztowanie i «paryski okres» w życiu Józefa Łobodowskiego w 1940 roku", ''Zeszyty Historyczne'', No.&nbsp;161, Paris, [[Instytut Literacki]], 2007, pp.&nbsp;196{{ndash}}235.  ISSN 0406-0393; {{ISBN|2716802084}}.  This invaluable source contains an appendix with transcripts (in the original French) of documents from Łobodowski's police dossier (pp.&nbsp;224{{ndash}}233), as well as Łobodowski's personal account (incomplete) of his dramatic escape from the internment camp at [[Nagykanizsa]] in Hungary (pp.&nbsp;233{{ndash}}235) and the two propaganda leaflets he penned for the [[Polish government-in-exile]], the one addressed to the [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian people]], the other to the soldiers of the [[Red Army]] (pp.&nbsp;222{{ndash}}224).</ref>

=== Post-War period ===

While Łobodowski was a frequent victim of censorship by the [[Sanacja]] régime before the War, his legal problems then were to be eclipsed by the very effective, blanket [[blacklist]]ing of all his writings by the [[Censorship in the People's Republic of Poland|communist censorship]] of the [[People's Republic of Poland|post-War Poland]], which accorded him "a place of honour on the blackest of blacklists" {{mdash}} in the words of the literary critic [[Michał Chmielowiec]].<ref>[[Michał Chmielowiec]], "O wierszach Józefa Łobodowskiego i o poezji w ogóle" (On the Poems of Józef Łobodowski and About Poetry in general), ''Wiadomości: tygodnik'' (London), vol.&nbsp;28, No.&nbsp;8 (1404), 25 February 1973, p.&nbsp;2.</ref> This resulted virtually in his being rendered, while still one of the best-known names in Polish literature, into an "[[unperson]]" in the [[Eastern Bloc]].<ref>[[Ryszard Matuszewski]] (1914{{ndash}}2010), ''Alfabet: wybór z pamięci 90-latka'', [[Warsaw]], Iskry, 2004, p.&nbsp;368.  {{ISBN|8320717647}}.</ref> The blackout continued into the 1980s.<ref>Cf. Józef Zięba (b. 1932), "Jak to ten Zięba mnie tak zeszmacił?" (How That Zięba had Trivialized Me), oral recollections of a [[Lublin]] ''[[littérateur]]'', recorded in conversation with M. Nawratowicz on 4 February 2009 for the Ośrodek Brama Grodzka{{ndash}}Teatr NN of Lublin, on the subject of his dealings with the Lublin censor's office in the context of publishing Łobodowski and other Polish poets (including the national bard of Polish literature, [[Adam Mickiewicz]]!) [http://biblioteka.teatrnn.pl/dlibra/dlibra/doccontent?id=38869 (See transcript online.)]</ref> Łobodowski believed that in every country in which a criminal political system holds dominion all those participating in any capacity in governance are responsible to some degree for the crimes committed in its name.<ref name="TKII" /> For this reason he regarded with empirical scepticism and moral contempt such events as the [[Khrushchev Thaw]] and the [[Perestroika]], for example, arguing that their authors, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] respectively, had not satisfactorily explained their own complicity in the crimes of the previous Soviet régimes which they later purported to criticize as the wrongdoing of others rather than their own.<ref name="TKII" /> The great communist empire was for him a satanic domain chiefly on account of its subversion of truth as a method of survival and self-preservation (rather than because of its expansionist propensities, the chief point in [[Ronald Reagan]]'s definition of the [[Evil Empire speech|Evil empire]]).<ref name="TKII" /> Thus the most effective method of combating [[totalitarianism]] was the upholding of [[Truth]] and its widest possible dissemination, a view which he upheld not only in theory but in his active practice as [[opinion journalism|opinion writer]] and translator of the [[Soviet dissidents|dissident writers]] suppressed within the [[Soviet Union]] and elsewhere: [[Andrei Sinyavsky]], [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], [[Yuli Daniel]], [[Andrei Sakharov]], and others ([[#Selected translations by Łobodowski|see Translations]]).
But during his life in Franco's Spain he did not make the slightest criticism of the Spanish fascist government.

== Postscript ==

Unlike many other poets, Łobodowski was very good at reading his own poems in public, and they gained at his recitation.<ref>[[Michał Chmielowiec]], "O wierszach Józefa Łobodowskiego i o poezji w ogóle" (On the Poems of Józef Łobodowski and About Poetry in general), ''Wiadomości: tygodnik'' (London), vol.&nbsp;28, No.&nbsp;8 (1404), 25 February 1973, p.&nbsp;1.</ref>

He was influenced by [[Juliusz Słowacki]],<ref>Łobodowski himself acknowledges the influence of [[Juliusz Słowacki|Słowacki]] on his poetry in his article "Tropicielom polskości" (To the Assayers of Polishness), ''[[Wiadomości Literackie]]'' (see ''[[:pl:Wiadomości Literackie|Wiadomości Literackie]]'') ([[Warsaw]]), vol.&nbsp;14, No.&nbsp;25 (711), 13 June 1937, p.&nbsp;5.</ref> [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]] (prose),<ref>The writer [[Czesław Jeśman]] saw [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]]'s novel ''[[In Desert and Wilderness]]'' as a model for Łobodowski's ''[[#Prose|Komysze]]''; see Czesław Jeśman, "W kubańskiej pustyni i puszczy", ''Wiadomości Literackie'' (London), No.&nbsp;16 (524), 1956, p.&nbsp;4.</ref> [[Julian Tuwim]], [[Kazimierz Wierzyński]], [[Józef Czechowicz]],<ref>"In his second, [[avant-garde]] phase, Łobodowski was doubtless inspired by the achievement of [[Józef Czechowicz|Czechowicz]], although he differed from him in the impulsiveness of his tone and in his radicalism in the social sphere": ''Pisarze emigracyjni: sylwetki'', ed.
