==Life==
Rae was born in [[Knightswood]], outside [[Glasgow]], in 1935, the son of a riveter.<ref name=TelegraphObit /> He lectured in creative writing at [[Glasgow University]] adult education classes.<ref name=TelegraphObit />

==Writing==
Rae was known for writing fiction, such as the thriller ''The Marksman'' later televised by the BBC. He was better known for his romantic historical novels written under the name Jessica Stirling.<ref name=TelegraphObit />

===Jessica Stirling novels===
After Rae had written a few crime thrillers, a publisher suggested he collaborate with a romantic short story writer, Peggy Coghlan, to produce a historic romantic novel set in the Victorian period. The publisher required this to be published under a female name, and the writers picked the name Jessica Stirling at a meeting in a [[Stirling]] coffee shop.<ref name=TelegraphObit />

Rae and Coghlan wrote seven Jessica Stirling novels together. Then, Rae went on to write another 30 such saga novels on his own, at a rate of two a year, published by [[Hodder & Stoughton]].<ref name=TelegraphObit />

Rae's real identity first became widely known in 1999, after 25 years of writing Jessica Stirling novels, when ''The Wind from the Hills'' was shortlisted for the [[Romantic Novelists' Association]] Romantic Novel of the Year prize.<ref name=TelegraphObit />
