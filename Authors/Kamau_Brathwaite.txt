==Biography==

===Early life and education===

'''Lawson Edward Brathwaite''' was born in the capital city of [[Bridgetown]], [[Barbados]], to Hilton and Beryl (Gill) Brathwaite.<ref>Genzlinger, Neil (17 February 2020), [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/17/obituaries/kamau-brathwaite-dies.html "Kamau Brathwaite, Poet Who Celebrated Caribbean Culture, Dies at 89"], ''The New York Times''.</ref> He began his secondary education in 1945 at [[Harrison College (Barbados)|Harrison College]] in Bridgetown, and while there wrote essays on jazz for a school newspaper that he started, as well as contributing articles to the literary magazine ''[[Bim (magazine)|Bim]]''.<ref name=eNotes>Staff (2001). [http://www.enotes.com/poetry-criticism/edward-kamau-brathwaite/ "Brathwaite, Edward Kamau – Biographical Information"], eNotes Literature Criticism, Poetry Criticism, Edward Kamau Brathwaite Criticism.</ref> In 1949 he won the Barbados Island Scholarship to attend the [[University of Cambridge]], where he studied English and History.<ref name=eNotes /> 
In 1953, Brathwaite received a B.A. honours degree in History from [[Pembroke College, Cambridge|Pembroke College]], Cambridge,<ref name=NBWC /><ref name=eNotes /> and he also began his association with the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Caribbean Voices]]'' programme in [[London]], where many of his poems and stories were broadcast.<ref name=eNotes /> In 1954 he received a Diploma of Education from Pembroke College, Cambridge.

===The years in Ghana===

The year 1955 found Brathwaite working as an education officer in the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] with the Ministry of Education. This saw him "witness Kwame Nkrumah coming to power and [[Ghana]] becoming the first African state to gain independence, which profoundly affected his sense of Caribbean culture and identity", and he was also able to study with the musicologist [[J. H. Kwabena Nketia]].<ref name=Innes />

In 1960, while he was on home leave from Ghana, Brathwaite married [[Doris Monica Wellcome]],<ref name=eNotes /> a [[Guyana|Guyanese]] graduate in [[Home Economics]] and Tropical Nutrition from the [[University of Leicester]],<ref name="Walmsley1992">{{cite book|author=Anne Walmsley|author-link=Anne Walmsley|title=The Caribbean Artists Movement, 1966–1972: A Literary & Cultural History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kgNaAAAAMAAJ|access-date=14 August 2011|year=1992|publisher=New Beacon Books|isbn=978-1-873201-01-5|page=39}}</ref> with whom he had a son, Michael.<ref name=Innes />

During his years in Ghana, Brathwaite's writing flowered, with ''Odale's Choice'' (a play) premiering at the [[Mfantsipim Senior High School|Mfantsiman Secondary School]] in [[Cape Coast]], in June 1962.<ref>James Gibbs, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QWmFnQfK_a8C&pg=PA219&lpg=PA219&dq=Odale%27s+Choice+(1967)+accra+brathwaite&source=bl&ots=TWBByun1cL&sig=ACfU3U0QfR54NE9Q47dKcHSWeolQvfjd_w&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj5xrG1r9vnAhWZgVwKHbcRCtQQ6AEwAXoECCMQAQ#v=onepage&q=brathwaite&f=false ''Nkyin-kyin: Essays on the Ghanaian Theatre''], Rodopi, 2009, p. 43.</ref> A full production of the play was later taken to [[Accra]].

===Return to the Caribbean and the UK===

In 1962–63, Brathwaite crossed the waters again and found himself as resident tutor in the Department of Extra-Mural Studies in [[St Lucia]]. Later in 1963, he made his journey to the [[University of the West Indies]] (UWI), [[Mona, Jamaica|Mona]] Campus in [[Kingston, Jamaica]], to teach in the History Department.

In 1966, Brathwaite spearheaded, as co-founder and secretary, the organization of the [[Caribbean Artists Movement]] (CAM) from [[London]],<ref name=PoetryInternational /> other key figures involved being [[John La Rose]] and [[Andrew Salkey]].<ref>[http://www.georgepadmoreinstitute.org/node/7 "John La Rose"], GPI website.</ref><ref>Kathleen Ho, [http://www.postcolonialweb.org/caribbean/trinidad/ho2.html "The Caribbean Artists Movement (CAM) and the Trinidad February Revolution of 1970"], Northwestern University.</ref>

In 1971 he launched ''[[Savacou]]'', a journal of CAM, at the University of the West Indies (UWI), Mona Campus in Kingston, Jamaica. That same year, Brathwaite received the name Kamau from [[Ngugi wa Thiong'o]]'s grandmother at [[Limuru]], [[Kenya]], while on a City of [[Nairobi]] Fellowship to the [[University of Nairobi]].<ref name=Innes>Innes, Lyn (5 February 2020), [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/05/edward-kamau-brathwaite-obituary "Edward Kamau Brathwaite obituary"], ''The Guardian''.</ref>

His doctoral thesis from Sussex University on ''The Development of Creole Society in Jamaica'' was published in 1971 by [[Oxford University Press]], and in 1973 he published what is generally considered his best work, ''The Arrivants: A New World Trilogy'', comprising three earlier volumes: ''Rights of Passage'' (1967), ''Masks'' (1968) and ''Islands'' (1969).<ref name=OCMPE>Mario Relich,

Brathwaite described the years from 1986 to 1990 as a "time of salt," in which he chronicled the death of his wife in 1986, the destruction of his archive in Irish Town, Jamaica, by Hurricane Gilbert in 1988, and his near-death experience as a result of a [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] shooting in 1990.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jenkins|first=Lee M.|title=Review: NewWorld/NewWord Style {{!}} Magical Realism by Kamau Brathwaite|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4489193?seq=3#metadata_info_tab_contentschronicled|journal=Contemporary Literature|volume=Vol. 48, No. 1 (Spring, 2007)|pages=165-171|via=JSTOR}}</ref>

==="Maroon years" and afterwards===

Kamau Brathwaite spent three self-financed "Maroon Years", 1997 to 2000, at "Cow Pasture", his now famous and, then, "post-hurricane" home in Barbados. In 1998 he married Beverly Reid, a Jamaican.<ref name=Innes />

In 1992 Brathwaite took up the position of Professor of Comparative Literature at [[New York University]], subsequently dividing his residence between Barbados and New York.<ref>[http://www.enciclopediapr.org/ing/article.cfm?ref=11112022 "Edward Kamau Brathwaithe"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623094215/http://enciclopediapr.org/ing/article.cfm?ref=11112022 |date=23 June 2013 }}, ''Puerto Rico Encyclopedia''.</ref>

In 1994, Brathwaite was awarded the [[Neustadt International Prize for Literature]] for his body of work, nominated by Ghanaian poet and author [[Kofi Awoonor]], edging out other nominees including; [[Toni Morrison]], [[Norman Mailer]], and [[Chinua Achebe]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.neustadtprize.org/1994-neustadt-prize-laureate-kamau-brathwaite/|title=1994 – Kamau Brathwaite|date=10 June 2013|website=Neustadt Prizes|language=en-US|access-date=29 May 2019}}</ref>

In 2004, after his retirement from New York University, Brathwaite began chronicling a ''Second Time of Salt'', musing on what he deemed a "cultural lynching."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Brathwaite|first=Kamau|title=The Second Time of Salts {{!}} Brathwaite {{!}} Scritture migranti|url=http://rivisteclueb.it/riviste/index.php/scritture_migranti/article/view/19|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Posthumous recognition and legacy==

Shortly before his death, Brathwaite was offered and had accepted the [[Bocas Henry Swanzy Award]] for Distinguished Service to Caribbean Letters, presented annually at the [[NGC Bocas Lit Fest]].<ref>[https://www.guardian.co.tt/news/bocas-lit-fest-to-honour-literary-icon-6.2.1048442.421baedd49 "Bocas Lit Fest to honour literary icon"], ''[[Trinidad & Tobago Guardian]]'', 6 February 2010.</ref> Announcing that the award, which recognises his contribution as a literary critic, literary activist, editor, and author on topics of Caribbean literature, as well as honouring the year of his 90th birthday, would be presented to his family in Barbados at a ceremony March, Bocas founder and director [[Marina Salandy-Brown]] said: "It now seems even more significant to honour him and, in this time of mourning, it is a small consolation to know that news of the award brought Prof Brathwaite pleasure in his final days."<ref>Tyrell Gittens, [https://newsday.co.tt/2020/02/06/bocas-lit-fest-to-posthumously-honour-kamau-brathwaite/ "Bocas Lit Fest to posthumously honour Kamau Brathwaite"], ''[[Trinidad and Tobago Newsday]]'', 6 February 2010.</ref>
