'''Hippolyte Jean Giraudoux''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒiʁodu|lang}}; 29 October 1882 – 31 January 1944) was a French [[novelist]], [[essayist]], [[diplomat]] and [[playwright]]. He is considered among the most important French dramatists of the period between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].<ref>Brockett, Oscar. ''History of the Theatre'' Boston: Allyn and Bacon. 1968. p. 621.</ref>  His work is noted for its stylistic elegance and poetic fantasy. Giraudoux's dominant theme is the relationship between man and woman—or in some cases, between man and some unattainable ideal.

==Biography==
Giraudoux was born in [[Bellac]], [[Haute-Vienne]], where his father, Léger Giraudoux, worked for the [[Minister of Transport (France)|Ministry of Transport]].  Giraudoux studied at the [[Lycée Lakanal]] in [[Sceaux, Hauts-de-Seine|Sceaux]] and upon graduation traveled extensively in Europe.  After his return to France in 1910, he accepted a position with the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (France)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]].  With the outbreak of World War I, he served with distinction and in 1915 became the first writer ever to be awarded the wartime [[Légion d'honneur|Legion of Honour]].<ref>Fowlie, Wallace. ''Jean Giraudoux'' in Gassner, John and Edward Quinn ed. ''The Reader's Encyclopedia of World Drama.'' New York, Thomas Crowell. 1969. p. 359.</ref>

He married in 1918 and in the subsequent inter-war period produced the majority of his writing.  He first achieved literary success through his novels, notably ''[[Siegfried et le Limousin]]'' (1922) and ''Eglantine'' (1927).  An ongoing collaboration with actor and theater director [[Louis Jouvet]], beginning in 1928 with Jouvet's radical streamlining of ''Siegfried'' for the stage, stimulated his writing.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/234192/Jean-Giraudoux |title=Encyclopædia Britannica Online: "Jean Giraudoux" |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |date=2013-11-06 |access-date=2014-06-03}}</ref> But it is his plays that gained him international renown.  He became well known in the English speaking world largely because of the award-winning adaptations of his plays by [[Christopher Fry]] (''[[The Trojan War Will Not Take Place|Tiger at the Gates]]'') and [[Maurice Valency]] (''[[The Madwoman of Chaillot]]'', ''[[Ondine (play)|Ondine]]'', ''[[The Enchanted (play)|The Enchanted]]'', ''[[The Apollo of Bellac]]'').

Giraudoux served as a juror with [[Florence Meyer Blumenthal]] in awarding the [[Prix Blumenthal]], a grant given between 1919 and 1954 to painters, sculptors, decorators, engravers, writers, and musicians.<ref name="FMBlumenthal">{{cite web
