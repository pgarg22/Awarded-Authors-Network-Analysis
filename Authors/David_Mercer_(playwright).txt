Both of his grandfathers had been miners.<ref name="Moat">{{cite web|last=Moat|first=Janet|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/476343/index.html|title=Mercer, David (1928–1980)|work=Screenonline|date=2003–2014|accessdate=21 July 2018}}</ref> After failing to gain entry to the local [[grammar school]], Mercer left school at 14, worked as a laboratory technician and in the [[Merchant Navy]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=John Russell|author-link=John Russell Taylor|title=The Second Wave|location=London|publisher=Eyre Methuen|year=1978|orig-year=1971|pages=47–8|isbn=0-413-45440-1}}</ref> before attending university.

In late 1957, now separated and living with Dilys Johnson (whom he later married), he rented a room in a flat at 10 Compayne Gardens, London NW6, that was rented, in turn, by the poet [[Jon Silkin]] from Rudolf Nassauer (a wine merchant, poet, and novelist) and his wife, [[Bernice Rubens]], who was later recipient of the 1970 [[Booker Prize]]. The historical novelist [[Malcolm Macdonald (novelist)|Malcolm Macdonald]], then a student at [[Slade School of Art|the Slade]], was another of Silkin's tenants at that time. At this location, Mercer wrote a more [[political fiction|political novel]] whose acerbic Northern hero, Congo Booth, was an early prototype of many disaffected-marxist heroes in his television plays. Neither novel was ever published. All three – Silkin, Mercer, and Macdonald – earned a living teaching English as a Foreign Language at the St Giles School of English in Oxford St. Mercer later taught English and Science at the Hairdressers College until his television and stage earnings enabled him to write full-time.

==Writing career==
Much of Mercer's television work for the [[BBC]] was made in collaboration with the director [[Don Taylor (English director and playwright)|Don Taylor]]. This dated from the beginning of Mercer's career as a television dramatist with the play trilogy, ''The Generations'', an attempt to depict the decline of an idealistic form of socialism over 60 years through the members of three generations of one family.<ref name="Hayward">{{cite news|last=Hayward|first=Anthony|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/don-taylor-37505.html|title=Don Taylor|work=The Independent|date=22 November 2003|access-date=19 April 2020}}</ref> This was composed of ''Where the Difference Begins'' (1961),<!-- check whether the central characters of his play ''Where the Difference Begins'' share his father's occupation. The London Times obit indicates the father in "After Haggerty" is an engine driver -->  a tale about two brothers, one who has abandoned socialism, while the other is a Labour Party intellectual; ''A Climate of Fear'' (1962) a piece in which a scientist in Britain's nuclear programme discovers his children have joined [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament|CND]]; and the non-naturalistic ''The Birth of a Private Man'' (1963), an account of an activists disenchantment with protest who attempts to match left-wing attitudes with the emerging 'affluent' society. The hero of the last play dies at the [[Berlin Wall]] facing a stream of bullets from both east and west.<ref name="Hayward" />

''A Way of Living'' (1963) was a naturalistic piece, and dealt with the division between a young fisherman and a girl from a mining family who is about to go to university. Three other television plays from this period – ''A Suitable Case for Treatment'' (1962, film adaptation: ''[[Morgan!|Morgan]]'', 1966), ''For Tea on Sunday'' (1963) and ''[[In Two Minds]]'' (1967) share a concern with madness or, in the critic [[John Russell Taylor]]'s words, "social alienation expressed in terms of psychological alienation".<ref>John Russell Taylor ''The Second Wave'', London: Eyre Methuen, 1978 reprint, p. 42 {{ISBN|0-413-45440-1}}</ref> ''In Two Minds'', directed by [[Ken Loach]], was remade as the feature film ''[[Family Life (1971 British film)|Family Life]]'' (1971), again directed by Loach.

Mercer's first play to be written for the stage, ''Ride a Cock Horse'', was seen in the [[West End theatre|West End]] in a 1965 production starring [[Peter O'Toole]]. An early work, the one-act ''The Governor's Lady'', in which an elderly colonial governor gradually turns into a [[gorilla]], was originally written for radio in 1960 but not performed until it was staged by the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] (RSC) in 1965. The RSC later premiered many of Mercer's works, including his next play ''Belcher's Luck'' (1966), "a wild tragi-comedy full of [[D. H. Lawrence|Lawrentian]] symbolism about fertility and impotence".<ref>John Russell Taylor ''Anger & After'', Methuen University Paperbacks edition, 1969, p. 316</ref> The RSC staged it at the Aldwych Theatre, as they did ''After Haggerty'' (1970); the father in the later is an engine driver, like Mercer's own father.<ref name="Times1980">{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/archive/article/1980-08-09/14/15.html|title=Obituary: Mr David Mercer, Forceful and Eloquent Dramatist|work=The Times|location=London|date=9 August 1980|access-date=19 April 2020|page=14}} {{subscription required}}</ref> The Comedy ''Flint'' (1970) was first performed at the [[Criterion Theatre|Criterion]] with <!-- Not knighted until 1983. -->[[Michael Hordern]] in the lead as a parson who believes he could not have survived "without a complete lack of faith", his sermons being "a form of bewildering interior monologue",<ref name="Times1980"/>

Other plays for television broadcast in the 1960s are ''And Did Those Feet'' (1965), ''The Parachute'' (1968) and ''Let's Murder Vivaldi'' (1968)<ref>John Russell Taylor ''Anger & After'', Methuen University Paperbacks edition, 1969, pp. 314–6</ref> and another trilogy, comprising ''On the Eve of Publication'' (1969), ''The Cellar and the Almond Tree'' (1970) and ''Emma's Time'' (1970). The content of this body of work made John Russell Taylor regard Mercer as the most political of British dramatists of this period.<ref>John Russell Taylor ''The Second Wave'', Eyre Methuen, 1978 reprint, p. 36 {{ISBN|0-413-45440-1}}</ref> ''Let's Murder Vivaldi'', which originated in the BBC's ''[[The Wednesday Play|Wednesday Play]]'' series, received a stage production at the [[King's Head Theatre|King's Head theatre club]] in 1972.<ref name="Times1980" />

In 1970, Mercer contributed ''White Poem'' – a [[monologue]] for a white [[Rhodesian]] [[Racism|racialist]] – to a [[Sharpeville massacre]] commemoration.<ref>John Russell Taylor ''The Second Wave'', Eyre Methuen, 1978 reprint, p. 56 {{ISBN|0-413-45440-1}}</ref>

Mercer wrote the screenplay for the [[Alain Resnais]] film ''[[Providence (1977 film)|Providence]]'' (1977), in which [[John Gielgud]] portrays an elderly, dying writer. The film won a [[César Award]].<ref name="NYT1980" />

==Private life==
In 1967, Mercer met a German actress, [[:fr:Maria Machado|Maria Machado]] with whom he later had his first child, [http://www.mayamercer.com Maya Mercer.]

A long-term heavy drinker, Mercer died in August 1980 after suffering a heart attack in [[Haifa]], [[Israel]], where he was living with his Israeli wife Dafna and their daughter Rebecca.<ref name="Moat"/>

== As fictional character ==

Mercer is depicted as Malcolm Sloman in the [[Trevor Griffiths]] play ''The Party'' (1973). In 1982, ''The Arcata Promise'', a stage adaptation of the 1974 television play, was produced by [[Brockman Seawell]] and premiered in New York in 1982, starring [[Brian Murray (actor)|Brian Murray]].<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/theater/stage-arcata-promise-study-of-a-psychopathic-actor.html, Mel Gussow, ''The New York Times'', 4 June 1982.</ref>
