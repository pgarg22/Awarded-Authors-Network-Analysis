'''Wioletta Grzegorzewska''', or '''Wioletta Greg''' (9 February 1974) is a [[Poles|Polish]] poet and writer, born in a small village [[Rzeniszów]] in [[Kraków-Częstochowa Upland|Jurassic Highland]] in Poland. In 2006, she left her country and moved to the [[Isle of Wight]]. She lives in [[Essex]].

==Life==
Wioletta spent ten years in [[Czestochowa]] where she organised cultural events, edited student journals, wrote articles about local literary developments. Between 1998 – 2012 she published six poetry volumes, as well as a novella ''Guguły'', in which she's covering her childhood and the experience of growing up in Communist Poland. Senior editor Max Porter from [[Portobello Books]] said:
<blockquote>
''Guguły''<ref>[http://www.novinki.de/gucia-katharina-wo-borkenkaefer-voelkerball-spielen-wioletta-grzegorzewskas-guguly/ "Wo Borkenkäfer Völkerball spielen: Wioletta Grzegorzewskas Guguły"], Novinki.</ref> is an enchanting and intriguing book. Wioletta Greg is a poet and every line of this haunting autobiographical novella has its own weird, beautiful atmosphere. It reminded me of [[Evie Wyld]], [[Ludmila Petrushevskaya]] and [[Herta Muller]]."<ref>Joshua Farrington, [http://www.thebookseller.com/news/greg-novella-portobello "Greg novella to Portobello"], ''[[The Bookseller]]'', 11 March 2015.</ref>

Her poetry book ''Finite Formulae & Theories of Chance'' has been shortlisted for the 2015 [[Griffin Poetry Prize]].<ref>[http://www.polishculture.org.uk/literature/events/news/article/finite-formulae-theories-of-chance-shortlisted-for-the-griffin-poetry-prize-2626.html "Finite Formulae & Theories of Chance shortlisted for the Griffin Poetry Prize!"], Polish Cultural institute.</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW5LPt26Jrs "Marek Kazmierski, poet Wioletta Greg read from Finite Formulae & Theories of Chance"], Griffin Poetry Prize. YouTube.</ref> The judges said:
<blockquote>
"These poems, as translated from Polish into English by Marek Kazmierski, retain the force of first experience and, equally, a collection of history’s remains. Greg’s thoughts include the catastrophe of the 20th century whose marks still wobble before her eyes, and the experience of living in post-Communist Poland. This stunning collection shows us (mostly through the eyes and memories of childhood) a world of objects transported across years. ‘Tossing satin bulbs into wicker baskets,’ the child poet is at ease with the earth and the hardy objects made from it. Greg grants us the privilege of seeing what she saw before she saw more."<ref>[http://www.griffinpoetryprize.com/awards-and-poets/shortlists/2015-shortlist/marek-kazmierski/ Marek Kazmierski] — Griffin Poetry Prize 2015, International Shortlist.</ref>
