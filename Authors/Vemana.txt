'''Vemana,''' popularly known as '''Yogi Vemana''', was an Indian philosopher and poet in the [[Telugu language]]. His poems are known for their use of simple language and native idioms. They discuss the subjects of [[yoga]], wisdom and morality.

== Early life and background ==
There is no consensus among scholars about the period in which Vemana lived. [[Charles Philip Brown|C.P. Brown]], known for his research on Vemana, estimates his year of birth to be 1652 based on some of his verses. Various sources say he was born in the fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=William Joseph|title=Vijayanagara voices: exploring South Indian history and Hindu literature|year=2004|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|isbn=978-0-7546-3950-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PxvDNBc4qwUC&pg=PA112e|page=112}}</ref>

Vemana was telinga to jangama community. Brown says this was in his original history of yogi vemana. Vemana was a Vedic scholar and he was a great yogi in achala sidhantha.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Vemana Community|url=https://wiki.indiancine.ma/wiki/Yogi%20Vemana|website=Indian Cinema Wiki}}</ref>

Vemana was born in Gandikota, Kadapa district in [[Andhra Pradesh]]. {{citation needed|date=October 2018}} //

== Death ==
There is a headstone marking the grave of Yogi Vemana in Katarupalli ([[Kadiri]] town), a village in Kadiri taluk, [[Anantapur district]], [[Andhra Pradesh]]. It is believed widely that Vemana died in this village. Being a Yogi, he was buried and not cremated

== Poetic style ==
Many lines of yogi Vemana's poems are now colloquial phrases of the Telugu language. They end with the signature line ''Viswadaabhi Raama Vinura Vema'', literally ''Beloved of Viswada, listen Vema''. There are many interpretations of what the last line signifies.

Vemana's poems were collected and published by Brown in the 19th century.<ref name=brown>Brown, C.P. (1829). ''[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/vov/ Verse of Vemana: Translated from the Telugu]''.</ref> His poems are of many kinds, social, moral, satirical and mystic nature. Most of them are in Ataveladi (dancing lady) [[meter (poetry)|meter]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}
