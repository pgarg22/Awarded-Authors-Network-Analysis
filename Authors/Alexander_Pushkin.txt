Pushkin was born into [[Russian nobility]] in Moscow.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.moscovery.com/alexander-pushkin/|title=Alexander Sergeevich Pushkin - Russian famous poet. Biography and interesting facts about his life}}</ref> His father, Sergey Lvovich Pushkin, belonged to Pushkin noble families. His maternal great-grandfather was Central-African-born general [[Abram Petrovich Gannibal]]. He published his first poem at the age of 15, and was widely recognized by the literary establishment by the time of his graduation from the [[Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum]]. Upon graduation from the Lycée, Pushkin recited his controversial poem "[[Ode to Liberty (poem)|Ode to Liberty]]", one of several that led to his exile by Tsar [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]]. While under the strict surveillance of the [[Third Section of His Imperial Majesty's Own Chancellery|Tsar's political police]] and unable to publish, Pushkin wrote his most famous play, the drama ''[[Boris Godunov (play)|Boris Godunov]]''. His novel in verse, ''[[Eugene Onegin]]'', was serialized between 1825 and 1832.

Pushkin was fatally wounded in a [[duel]] with his wife's alleged lover and her sister's husband [[Georges-Charles de Heeckeren d'Anthès]], also known as Dantes-Gekkern, a French officer serving with the [[Chevalier Guard Regiment]].

==Ancestry==
Pushkin's father, Sergei Lvovich Pushkin (1767–1848), was descended from a distinguished family of the Russian nobility that traced its ancestry back to the 12th century.<ref name="Saint Petersburg 2007">Н.К.

Ossip Abramovich Gannibal's father, Pushkin's great-grandfather, was [[Abram Petrovich Gannibal]] (1696–1781), an African [[Page (occupation)|page]] kidnapped to [[Constantinople]] as a gift to the [[Ottoman Sultan]] and later transferred to Russia as a gift for [[Peter the Great]]. Abram wrote in a letter to Empress Elizabeth, Peter the Great's daughter, that Gannibal was from the town of "Lagon". Largely on the basis of a mythical biography by Gannibal's son-in-law Rotkirkh, some historians concluded from this that Gannibal was born in a village called Geza-Lamza in the [[Seraye]] province of [[Mdre Bahri]] kingdom in todays [[Eritrea]].<ref name="Nsl">{{cite book|title=New Statesman|date=2005|publisher=New Statesman Limited|page=36|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=aowxAQAAIAAJ|access-date=7 January 2015}}</ref> [[Vladimir Nabokov]], when researching ''[[Eugene Onegin]]'', cast serious doubt on this origin theory.

==Early life==
[[File:Pushkin derzhavin.jpg|thumb|Pushkin recites his poem before [[Gavrila Derzhavin]] during an exam in the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum on January 8th, 1815. Painting by [[Ilya Repin]] (1911)]]
Born in Moscow, Pushkin was entrusted to nursemaids and French tutors, and spoke mostly French until the age of ten. He became acquainted with the Russian language through communication with household serfs and his nanny, Arina Rodionovna, whom he loved dearly and was more attached to than to his own mother. He published his first poem at the age of 15. When he finished school, as part of the first graduating class of the prestigious [[Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum|Imperial Lyceum]] in [[Tsarskoye Selo]], near Saint Petersburg, his talent was already widely recognized on the Russian literary scene. At the Lyceum, he was a student of David Mara, known in Russia as {{ill|David de Boudry|fr}}, a younger brother of French revolutionary [[Jean-Paul Marat]].<ref name=Goetz>{{cite news|url=http://docplayer.fr/14907605-Jean-paul-marat-notice-generale-etapes-de-vie-action-journaux-livres-theorie-politique.html|author=Goëtz-Nothomb, Charlotte|language=fr|page=9|title=Jean-Paul Marat - Notice Generale}}</ref> At After school, Pushkin plunged into the vibrant and raucous intellectual youth culture of St. Petersburg, which was then the capital of the [[Russian Empire]]. In 1820, he published his first long poem, ''[[Ruslan and Ludmila]]'', with much controversy about its subject and style.

==Social activism==
While at the Lyceum, Pushkin was heavily influenced by the Kantian [[liberalism|liberal]] individualist teachings of Alexander Petrovich Kunitsyn, whom Pushkin would later commemorate in his poem ''19 October''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Schapiro |first1=Leonard |title=Rationalism and Nationalism in Russian Nineteenth Century Political Thought |date=1967 |publisher=Yale University Press |pages=48–50 |quote=Schapiro writes that Kunitsyn’s influence on Pushkin’s political views was 'important above all.' Schapiro describes Kunitsyn's philosophy as conveying 'the most enlightened principles of past thought on the relations of the individual and the state,' namely, that the ruler’s power is 'limited by the natural rights of his subjects, and these subjects can never be treated as a means to an end but only as an end in themselves.'}}</ref> Pushkin also immersed himself in the thought of the French [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], to which he would remain permanently indebted throughout his life, particularly [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]] and [[Voltaire]], whom he described as "the first to follow the new road, and to bring the lamp of philosophy into the dark archives of history".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kahn |first1=Andrew |title=Pushkin's Lyric Intelligence |date=2008 |publisher=OUP Oxford |page=283}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Pushkin |first1=Alexander |title=The Letters of Alexander Pushkin |date=1967 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |page=164}}</ref>

Pushkin gradually became committed to social reform, and emerged as a spokesman for literary radicals. That angered the government and led to his transfer from the capital in May 1820.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}} He went to the [[Caucasus]] and to [[Crimea]] and then to [[Kamianka, Cherkasy Oblast|Kamianka]] and [[Chișinău]] in [[Moldavia]], where he became a [[Freemason]].

[[File:Анна Петровна Керн.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Pushkin's married lover [[Anna Petrovna Kern]], for whom he probably wrote the [[wikisource:To*** Kern|most famous love poem]] in Russian]]

He joined the [[Filiki Eteria]], a secret organization whose purpose was to overthrow Ottoman rule in Greece and establish an independent Greek state. He was inspired by the [[Greek Revolution]] and when the war against the [[Ottoman Turks]] broke out, he kept a diary recording the events of the national uprising.

==Rise==
He stayed in Chișinău until 1823 and wrote two [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poems, which brought him acclaim: ''The Captive of the Caucasus'' and ''[[The Fountain of Bakhchisaray]]''. In 1823, Pushkin moved to [[Odessa]], where he again clashed with the government, which sent him into exile on his mother's rural estate of [[Mikhaylovskoye Museum Reserve|Mikhailovskoye]] (near Pskov) from 1824 to 1826.<ref>''Images of Pushkin in the works of the black "pilgrims".'' Ahern, Kathleen M. [[The Mississippi Quarterly]] p. 75(11) Vol. 55 No. 1 {{ISSN|0026-637X}}. 22 December 2001.</ref>

In Mikhaylovskoye, Pushkin wrote nostalgic love poems which he dedicated to Elizaveta Vorontsova, wife of [[Little Russia|Malorossia]]'s [[General-Governor]].<ref>{{in lang|ru}} P.K. Guber. Don Juan List of A. S. Pushkin. [[Petrograd]], 1923 (reprinted in [[Kharkiv]], 1993). pp. 78, 90–99.</ref> Then Pushkin continued work on his verse-novel ''Eugene Onegin''.

In Mikhaylovskoye, in 1825, Pushkin wrote the poem ''To***''. It is generally believed that he dedicated this poem to [[Anna Petrovna Kern|Anna Kern]], but there are other opinions. Poet Mikhail Dudin believed that the poem was dedicated to the serf Olga Kalashnikova.<ref name=VNLS>{{in lang|ru}} [http://www.lych.ru/online/0ainmenu-65/32--s32008/96-n-- Vadim Nikolayev.

Authorities summoned Pushkin to Moscow after his poem "[[Ode to Liberty (poem)|Ode to Liberty]]" was found among the belongings of the rebels from the [[Decembrist revolt|Decembrist Uprising]] (1825). After his exile in 1820,<ref name=TG>{{cite web|work=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/21/pushkin-opera-debut-grange-park-marita-phillips-russian|title=Pushkin descendant puts Russian poet's turbulent life on stage for first time|author=Thorpe, Vanessa|date=21 April 2018}}</ref> Pushkin's friends and family continually petitioned for his release, sending letters and meeting with [[Alexander I of Russia|Tsar Alexander I]] and then [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar Nicholas I]] on the heels of the Decembrist Uprising. Upon meeting with [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar Nicholas I]], Pushkin obtained his release from exile and began to work as the tsar's Titular Counsel of the National Archives. However, because insurgents in the Decembrist Uprising (1825) in Saint Petersburg had kept some of Pushkin's earlier political poems, the tsar retained strict control of everything Pushkin published and he was banned from travelling at will.

During that same year (1825), Pushkin also wrote what would become his most famous play, the drama ''[[Boris Godunov (play)|Boris Godunov]]'', while at his mother's estate. He could not however, gain permission to publish it until five years later. The original and uncensored version of the drama was not staged until 2007.

Around 1825–1829 he met and befriended the Polish poet [[Adam Mickiewicz]], during exile in central Russia.<ref name="psb696">[[Kazimierz Wyka]], ''Mickiewicz Adam Bernard'', Polski Słownik Biograficzny, Tome XX, 1975, p. 696</ref> In 1829 he travelled through the Caucasus to [[Erzurum]] to visit friends fighting in the Russian army during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–29)|Russo-Turkish War]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Reuel K.|title=Pushkin's Journey to Erzurum|pages=98–121|year=1974|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-90-247-1558-9|doi=10.1007/978-94-010-1997-2_10}}</ref> In the end of 1829 Pushkin wanted to set off on a journey abroad, the desire reflected in his poem ''Поедем, я готов; куда бы вы, друзья...''<ref>[http://feb-web.ru/feben/pushkin/texts/push17/vol03/y03-191-.htm?cmd=p Поедем, я готов; куда бы вы, друзья...]{{in lang|ru}}</ref> He applied for permission for the journey, but received negative response from [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]], on 17 January 1830.<ref>{{cite book|first=A.S.|last=Pushkin|title=Sobranie sochinenii|publisher=Khudozhestvennaya Literatura|location=Moscow|year=1974|volume=Vol. 2|pages=581}}</ref>

[[Image:Natalia Pushkina by Brullov.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Natalia Pushkina, portrait by [[Alexander Brullov]], 1831.]]
Around 1828, Pushkin met [[Natalia Pushkina|Natalia Goncharova]], then 16 years old and one of the most talked-about beauties of Moscow. After much hesitation, Natalia accepted a proposal of marriage from Pushkin in April 1830, but not before she received assurances that the Tsarist government had no intentions to persecute the libertarian poet. Later, Pushkin and his wife became regulars of court society. They officially became engaged on 6 May 1830, and sent out wedding invitations. Due to an outbreak of [[cholera]] and other circumstances, the wedding was delayed for a year. The ceremony took place on 18 February 1831 (Old Style) in the [[Great Ascension Church]] on [[Bolshaya Nikitskaya Street]] in Moscow. When the [[Tsar]] gave Pushkin the lowest court title, Gentleman of the Chamber, the poet became enraged, feeling that the Tsar intended to humiliate him by implying that Pushkin was being admitted to court not on his own merits but solely so that his wife, who had many admirers including the Tsar himself, could properly attend court balls.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

[[File:D'Anthès.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Georges d'Anthès]]]]
In the year 1831, during the period of Pushkin's growing literary influence, he met one of Russia's other great early writers, [[Nikolai Gogol]]. After reading Gogol's 1831–1832 volume of short stories ''[[Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka]]'', Pushkin supported him and would feature some of Gogol's most famous short stories in the magazine ''[[Sovremennik|The Contemporary]]'', which he founded in 1836.

==Death==
By the autumn of 1836, Pushkin was falling into greater and greater debt and faced scandalous rumours that his wife was having a love affair. On 4 November he sent a challenge to a duel to [[Georges-Charles de Heeckeren d'Anthès|Georges d'Anthès]], also known as Dantes-Gekkern. [[Jacob van Heeckeren tot Enghuizen|Jacob van Heeckeren]], d'Anthès' adoptive father, asked that the duel be delayed by two weeks. With efforts by the poet's friends, the duel was cancelled.

On 17 November d'Anthès made a proposal to Natalia Goncharova's sister – Ekaterina Goncharova. The marriage did not resolve the conflict. Georges d'Anthès continued to pursue Natalia Goncharova in public, and rumours that d'Anthès had married Natalia's sister just to save her reputation circulated.

On 26 January (7 February in the Gregorian calendar) of 1837, Pushkin sent a "highly insulting letter" to Gekkern. The only answer to that letter could be a challenge to a duel, as Pushkin knew. Pushkin received the formal challenge to a duel through his sister-in-law, Ekaterina Gekkerna, approved by d'Anthès, on the same day through the attaché of the French Embassy, Viscount d'Archiac.

Pushkin asked [[Arthur Magenis]], then attaché to the [[Consulate-General of the United Kingdom, Saint Petersburg|British Consulate-General in Saint Petersburg]], to be his second. Magenis did not formally accept, but on 26 January (7 February), approached Viscount d'Archiac to attempt a reconciliation; however, d'Archiac refused to speak with him as he was not yet officially Pushkin's second. Magenis, unable to find Pushkin in the evening, sent him a letter through a messenger at 2 o'clock in the morning, declining to be his second as the possibility of a peaceful settlement had already been quashed, and the traditional first task of the second was to try to bring about a reconciliation.<ref name="simmons">{{cite news |last1=Simmons |first1=Ernest J. |title=Pushkin |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.126492/page/n435/mode/2up/search/magenis |access-date=28 January 2020 |date=1922|ref=Simmons |page=412}}</ref><ref name="binyon">{{cite book |last1=Binyon |first1=T.

The pistol duel with d'Anthès took place on 27 January (8 February) at the [[Chernaya River (Saint Petersburg)|Black River]], without the presence of a second for Pushkin. The duel they fought was of a kind known as a ''barrier duel''.<ref group=note>This was coincidentally the same form of duel as the one depicted in ''Eugene Oengin'', see Hopton (2011)</ref> The rules of this type dictated that the duellists began at an agreed distance. After the signal to begin, they walked towards each other, closing the distance. They could fire at any time they wished, but the duellist that shot first was required to stand still and wait for the other to shoot back at his leisure.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hopton |first=Richard |title=Pistols at Dawn: A History of Duelling |date=1 January 2011 |publisher=Little, Brown Book Group Limited |isbn=978-0-7499-2996-1|pages=85-87}}</ref>

D'Anthès fired first, critically wounding Pushkin; the bullet entered at his hip and penetrated his abdomen. D'Anthès was only lightly wounded in the right arm by Pushkin's shot. Two days later, on 29 January (10 February) at 14:45, Pushkin died of [[peritonitis]].

At Pushkin's wife's request, he was put in the coffin in evening dress – not in chamber-cadet uniform, the uniform provided by the tsar. The funeral service was initially assigned to the St. Isaac's Cathedral, but was moved to Konyushennaya church. Many people attended. After the funeral, the coffin was lowered into the basement, where it stayed until 3 February, when it was removed to Pskov province. Alexander Pushkin was buried on the grounds of the Svyatogorsky monastery in present-day [[Pushkinskiye Gory]], near Pskov, beside his mother. His last home is now a [[National Pushkin Museum|museum]].

==Descendants==
Pushkin had four children from his marriage to Natalia: Maria (b. 1832), Alexander (b. 1833), Grigory (b. 1835) and Natalia (b. 1836), the last of whom married [[morganatic marriage|morganatically]] with [[Prince Nikolaus Wilhelm of Nassau]] (of the [[House of Nassau-Weilburg]]) and was granted the title of [[Count of Merenberg|Countess of Merenberg]].

Only the lines of Alexander and Natalia still remain. Natalia's granddaughter, [[Nadejda Mountbatten, Marchioness of Milford Haven|Nadejda]], married into the extended British royal family (her husband was the uncle of [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]]).<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/secret/famous/pushkingenealogy.html Pushkin Genealogy].

===Literary===
Critics consider many of his works masterpieces, such as the poem ''[[The Bronze Horseman (poem)|The Bronze Horseman]]'' and the drama ''[[The Stone Guest (play)|The Stone Guest]]'', a tale of the fall of [[Don Juan]]. His poetic short drama ''[[Mozart and Salieri (play)|Mozart and Salieri]]'' (like ''The Stone Guest'', one of the so-called four ''Little Tragedies'', a collective characterization by Pushkin himself in 1830 letter to [[Pyotr Pletnyov]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Nancy K. (trans. & ed.)|title=The Little Tragedies by Alexander Pushkin|year=2000|location=New Haven|publisher=Yale University Press|pages=[https://archive.org/details/littletragedies00alek/page/1 1 & 213 n.1]|isbn=0300080255|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/littletragedies00alek/page/1}}.</ref>) was the inspiration for [[Peter Shaffer]]'s ''[[Amadeus (play)|Amadeus]]'' as well as providing the libretto (almost verbatim) to [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s opera ''[[Mozart and Salieri (opera)|Mozart and Salieri]]''.

Pushkin is also known for his short stories. In particular his cycle ''[[The Belkin Tales|The Tales of the Late Ivan Petrovich Belkin]]'', including "[[The Shot (Pushkin)|The Shot]]", were well received. According to the literary theorist Kornelije Kvas, <blockquote> "the narrative logic and the plausibility of that which is narrated, together with the precision, conciseness – economy of the presentation of reality – all of the above is achieved in ''Tales of Belkin'', especially, and most of all in the story ''The Stationmaster''. Pushkin is the progenitor of the long and fruitful development of Russian realist literature, for he manages to attain the realist ideal of a concise presentation of reality".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kvas|first=Kornelije|title=The Boundaries of Realism in World Literature|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2020|isbn=978-1-7936-0910-6|location=Lanham, Boulder, New York, London|pages=26}}</ref></blockquote> Pushkin himself preferred his verse novel ''[[Eugene Onegin]]'', which he wrote over the course of his life and which, starting a tradition of great Russian novels, follows a few central characters but varies widely in tone and focus.

''Onegin'' is a work of such complexity that, though it is only about a hundred pages long, translator [[Vladimir Nabokov]] needed two full volumes of material to fully render its meaning in English. Because of this difficulty in translation, Pushkin's verse remains largely unknown to English readers. Even so, Pushkin has profoundly influenced western writers like [[Henry James]].<ref name="Leary">[http://www2.newpaltz.edu/~hathaway/ejournal2.html Joseph S. O'Leary, ”Pushkin in 'The Aspern Papers{{'}}”. ''The Henry James E-Journal'' Number 2, March 2000] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181005013429/http://www2.newpaltz.edu/~hathaway/ejournal2.html |date=5 October 2018 }}. Retrieved 24 November 2006.</ref>
Pushkin wrote "[[The Queen of Spades (story)|The Queen of Spades]]", a short story frequently anthologized in English translation.

===Musical===
Pushkin's works also provided fertile ground for Russian composers. [[Mikhail Glinka|Glinka]]'s ''[[Ruslan and Lyudmila (opera)|Ruslan and Lyudmila]]'' is the earliest important Pushkin-inspired opera, and a landmark in the tradition of Russian music. [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s operas ''[[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Eugene Onegin]]'' (1879) and ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]'' (''Pikovaya Dama'', 1890) became perhaps better known outside of Russia than Pushkin's own works of the same name.

[[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s monumental ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]'' (two versions, 1868–9 and 1871–2) ranks as one of the very finest and most original of Russian operas.
Other Russian operas based on Pushkin include [[Alexander Dargomyzhsky|Dargomyzhsky]]'s ''[[Rusalka (Dargomyzhsky)|Rusalka]]'' and ''[[The Stone Guest (Dargomyzhsky)|The Stone Guest]]''; [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s ''[[Mozart and Salieri (opera)|Mozart and Salieri]]'', ''[[The Tale of Tsar Saltan (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Tale of Tsar Saltan]]'', and ''[[The Golden Cockerel]]''; [[César Cui|Cui]]'s ''[[Prisoner of the Caucasus (opera)|Prisoner of the Caucasus]]'', ''[[Feast in Time of Plague (opera)|Feast in Time of Plague]]'', and ''[[The Captain's Daughter (opera)|The Captain's Daughter]]''; [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Mazeppa (opera)|Mazeppa]]''; [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]]'s one-act operas ''[[Aleko (opera)|Aleko]]'' (based on ''The Gypsies'') and ''[[The Miserly Knight]]''; [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Mavra]]'', and [[Eduard Nápravník|Nápravník]]'s ''[[Dubrovsky (opera)|Dubrovsky]]''.

Additionally, ballets and [[cantata]]s, as well as innumerable [[Art song|songs]], have been set to Pushkin's verse (including even his French-language poems, in [[Isabelle Aboulker]]'s [[song cycle]] "[[Troika (album)|Caprice étrange]]"). [[Franz von Suppé|Suppé]], [[Ruggiero Leoncavallo|Leoncavallo]] and [[Gian Francesco Malipiero|Malipiero]] have also based operas on his works.<ref>Taruskin R.

''The Desire of Glory'', which has been dedicated to Elizaveta Vorontsova, was set to music by [[David Tukhmanov]] {{YouTube|pRWJ1V0rgB4|(Vitold Petrovsky – The Desire of Glory}}), as well as ''Keep Me, Mine Talisman'' – by [[Alexander Barykin]] {{YouTube|rrlHaXYKzFo|(Alexander Barykin – Keep Me, Mine Talisman}}) and later by Tukhmanov.

===Romanticism===
Pushkin is considered by many to be the central representative of Romanticism in Russian literature although he was not unequivocally known as a Romantic. Russian critics have traditionally argued that his works represent a path from [[Neoclassicism]] through Romanticism to [[Literary realism|Realism]]. An alternative assessment suggests that "he had an ability to entertain contrarities which may seem Romantic in origin, but are ultimately subversive of all fixed points of view, all single outlooks, including the Romantic" and that "he is simultaneously Romantic and not Romantic".<ref name=basker/>

===Russian literature===
Pushkin is usually credited with developing Russian literature. He is seen as having originated the highly nuanced level of language which characterizes Russian literature after him, and he is also credited with substantially augmenting the Russian lexicon. Whenever he found gaps in the Russian vocabulary, he devised [[calque]]s. His rich vocabulary and highly-sensitive style are the foundation for modern Russian literature. His accomplishments set new records for development of the Russian language and culture. He became the father of Russian literature in the 19th century, marking the highest achievements of the 18th century and the beginning of literary process of the 19th century. He introduced Russia to all the European literary genres as well as a great number of West European writers. He brought natural speech and foreign influences to create modern poetic Russian. Though his life was brief, he left examples of nearly every literary genre of his day: lyric poetry, narrative poetry, the novel, the short story, the drama, the critical essay and even the personal letter.

According to [[Vladimir Nabokov]], <blockquote>Pushkin's [[idiom]] combined all the contemporaneous elements of Russian with all he had learned from [[Gavrila Derzhavin|Derzhavin]], [[Vasily Zhukovsky|Zhukovsky]], [[Konstantin Batyushkov|Batyushkov]], [[Nikolay Karamzin|Karamzin]] and [[Ivan Krylov|Krylov]]:

# The poetical and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] strain that still lived in [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]] forms and locutions
# Abundant and natural [[gallicism]]s
# Everyday [[colloquialism]]s of his set
# Stylized popular speech by combining the famous three styles (low, medium elevation, high) dear to the pseudoclassical archaists and adding the ingredients of Russian romanticists with a pinch of [[parody]].<ref>[[Vladimir Nabokov]], ''Verses and Versions'', p. 72.</ref></blockquote>

His work as a critic and as a journalist marked the birth of Russian magazine culture which included him devising and contributing heavily to one of the most influential literary magazines of the 19th century, the ''Sovremennik'' (''The Contemporary'', or ''Современник''). Pushkin inspired the [[Russian fairy tale|folk tales]] and genre pieces of other authors: [[Nikolai Leskov|Leskov]], [[Sergei Yesenin|Yesenin]] and [[Maxim Gorky|Gorky]]. His use of Russian language formed the basis of the style of novelists [[Ivan Turgenev]], [[Ivan Goncharov]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]], as well as that of subsequent lyric poets such as [[Mikhail Lermontov]]. Pushkin was analysed by [[Nikolai Gogol]], his successor and pupil, and the great Russian critic [[Vissarion Belinsky]], who produced the fullest and deepest critical study of Pushkin's work, which still retains much of its relevance.

===Soviet Centennial celebrations===

The centennial year of Pushkin's death, 1937, was one of the most significant Soviet-era literary centennials in Stalinist Russia, rivaled only by the 1928 centennial commemorating [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s birth. Despite the public display of visage on ever present billboards and candy wrappers, Pushkin's "image" conflicted with that of the ideal Soviet (he was reputed as a [[libertine]] with unrepentant aristocratic tendencies) and was subject to a repressive revisionism, similar to the Stalinist state's clean up of Tolstoy's [[Christian anarchism]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Morrison |first=Simon |title=Sergey Prokofiev and His World |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=2008 |page=60}}</ref>
