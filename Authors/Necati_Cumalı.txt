'''Necati Cumalı''' (13 January 1921 – 10 January 2001) was a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] writer of novels, short-stories, essays and poetry. He was born in [[Florina|Florina, Greece]] to a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] family and his family had settled in [[Urla, İzmir|Urla]] near [[İzmir]] in the framework of the 1923 agreement for the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]].

==Biography==
He grew up in Urla and did his studies in İzmir and he started his law education at İstanbul University then completed it in the Law School of the [[University of Ankara]]. He started writing poetry while he was still a student and his poems were published as of early 1940s in such prominent [[Turkish literature|Turkish]] literary periodicals as Varlık and Servet-i Fünun. Toward the end of that decade, while he was doing his military service, he also started writing short stories in which the profound influence of another important Turkish writer, [[Sabahattin Ali]], could be felt. This, and the themes of social consciousness obvious in his works could be the reason for which he was sometimes cited in the same title as other "writers of the [[Left-wing politics|left]]", although he never actively engaged in political issues.

His vivid portrayal of women in his works was particularly noted.<ref>{{cite journal|title = Some Aspects of the Portrayal of Women in Modern Turkish Literature |jstor = 194319

==Works==
One of his best known works is the short-novel, "Dry Summer" (''Susuz Yaz''), adapted by the film director [[Metin Erksan]] to [[Dry Summer|cinema in 1964]], starring [[Hülya Koçyiğit]] and [[Erol Taş]], and which won the [[Golden Bear]] award in [[Berlin Film Festival]] that year.

Another famous novel by Necati Cumalı is "Devastated Hills: [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] 1900" (''Viran Dağlar: Makedonya 1900''), where he relates the history of his own family which descended from a long line of [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] [[Bey]]s (''Cuma Beyleri'', "the Beys of Djuma"), with the turmoil in the [[Balkans]] providing the background. This novel has been adapted (not very faithfully) for the television by [[Michel Favart]] in 2001 as a multinational [[Arte|ARTE]] production under the title "Le dernier Seigneur des Balkans".<ref>{{cite web|title=Le dernier Seigneur des Balkans|url=http://www.arte-tv.com/fr/cinema-fiction/Seigneur-des-Balkans/1025186.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20071104064328/http://www.arte-tv.com/fr/cinema-fiction/Seigneur-des-Balkans/1025186.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2007-11-04|publisher=[[Arte|ARTE]]|year=2005|language=fr}}</ref>

His poetry was translated into French by Tahsin Saraç.
