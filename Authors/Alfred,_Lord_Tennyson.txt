'''Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson''' {{postnominals|country=UK|FRS}} (6 August 1809 – 6 October 1892) was an English poet. He was the [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]] during much of [[Queen Victoria]]'s reign and remains one of the most popular British poets.{{fact|date=May 2021}} In 1829, Tennyson was awarded the [[Chancellor's Gold Medal]] at Cambridge for one of his first pieces, "Timbuktu". He published his first solo collection of poems, ''Poems Chiefly Lyrical'' in 1830. "Claribel" and "[[Mariana (poem)|Mariana]]", which remain some of Tennyson's most celebrated poems, were included in this volume. Although described by some critics as overly sentimental, his verse soon proved popular and brought Tennyson to the attention of well-known writers of the day, including [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]. Tennyson's early poetry, with its medievalism and powerful visual imagery, was a major influence on the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]].

Tennyson also excelled at penning short lyrics, such as "[[Break, Break, Break]]", "[[The Charge of the Light Brigade (poem)|The Charge of the Light Brigade]]", "[[Tears, Idle Tears]]", and "[[Crossing the Bar]]". Much of his verse was based on [[classical mythology|classical]] mythological themes, such as "[[Ulysses (poem)|Ulysses]]", although "[[In Memoriam A.H.H.]]" was written to commemorate his friend [[Arthur Hallam]], a fellow poet and student at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], after he died of a stroke at the age of 22.<ref>{{cite book|title=Queers in History| publisher=Quistory Publishers| year=2007| edition=2007| author=Stern, Keith}}</ref> Tennyson also wrote some notable [[blank verse]] including ''[[Idylls of the King]]'', "[[Ulysses (poem)|Ulysses]]", and "[[Tithonus (poem)|Tithonus]]". During his career, Tennyson attempted drama, but his plays enjoyed little success.

A number of phrases from Tennyson's work have become commonplace in the English language, including "Nature, red in tooth and claw" ("In Memoriam A.H.H."), "'Tis better to have loved and lost / Than never to have loved at all", "Theirs not to reason why, / Theirs but to do and die", "My strength is as the strength of ten, / Because my heart is pure", "To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield", "Knowledge comes, but Wisdom lingers", and "The old order changeth, yielding place to new". He is the ninth most frequently quoted writer in ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]''.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1999|edition=5th}}</ref>

==Early life==
Tennyson was born on 6 August 1809 in [[Somersby, Lincolnshire|Somersby]], Lincolnshire, England.<ref>Alfred Lord Tennyson: A Brief Biography, Glenn Everett, Associate Professor of English, the University of Tennessee at Martin</ref> He was born into a middle-class family distantly descended from [[John Savage, 2nd Earl Rivers]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MU5RKM6ekl4C&pg=PA51 |pages=50–52 |title=The Ancient and Noble Family of the Savages of the Ards, with Sketches of English and American Branches of the House of Savage: Comp.

[[File: W.E.F. Britten - The Early Poems of Alfred, Lord Tennyson - The Garden at Somersby Rectory.jpg|thumb|upright|An illustration by [[William Edward Frank Britten|W. E. F. Britten]] showing Somersby Rectory, where Tennyson was raised and began writing]]

His father, George Clayton Tennyson (1778–1831), was an Anglican clergyman who served as rector of Somersby (1807–1831), also rector of [[Benniworth]] (1802–1831) and [[Bag Enderby]], and vicar of [[Grimsby]] (1815). He raised a large family and "was a man of superior abilities and varied attainments, who tried his hand with fair success in architecture, painting, music, and poetry. He was comfortably well off for a country clergyman and his shrewd money management enabled the family to spend summers at [[Mablethorpe]] and [[Skegness]] on the eastern coast of England". Alfred Tennyson's mother, Elizabeth Fytche (1781–1865), was the daughter of Stephen Fytche (1734–1799), vicar of [[St. James Church, Louth]] (1764) and rector of [[Withcall]] (1780), a small village between [[Horncastle, Lincolnshire|Horncastle]] and [[Louth, Lincolnshire|Louth]]. Tennyson's father "carefully attended to the education and training of his children".

Tennyson and two of his elder brothers were writing poetry in their teens and a collection of poems by all three was published locally when Alfred was only 17. One of those brothers, [[Charles Tennyson Turner]], later married Louisa Sellwood, the younger sister of Alfred's [[Emily Tennyson, Lady Tennyson|future wife]]; the other was [[Frederick Tennyson]]. Another of Tennyson's brothers, Edward Tennyson, was institutionalised at a private asylum.

==Education and first publication==
Tennyson was a student of [[King Edward&nbsp;VI Grammar School, Louth]] from 1816 to 1820.<ref name="Parsons">''Poems of Alfred Lord Tennyson.'' Eugene Parsons (Introduction). New York: Thomas Y. Crowell Company, 1900.</ref> He entered [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], in 1827, where he joined a secret society called the [[Cambridge Apostles]].<ref>{{acad|id=TNY827A|name=Tennyson, Alfred}}</ref> A portrait of Tennyson by [[George Frederic Watts]] is in Trinity's collection.<ref>{{cite web|title=Trinity College, University of Cambridge|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/paintings/search/located_at/trinity-college-cambridge-5846_locations|publisher=BBC Your Paintings|access-date=12 February 2018|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140511164255/http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/paintings/search/located_at/trinity-college-cambridge-5846_locations|archive-date=11 May 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

At Cambridge, Tennyson met [[Arthur Hallam]] and [[William Henry Brookfield]], who became his closest friends. His first publication was a collection of "his boyish rhymes and those of his elder brother Charles" entitled ''Poems by Two Brothers'', published in 1827.<ref name="Parsons"/>

In 1829, Tennyson was awarded the [[Chancellor's Gold Medal]] at Cambridge for one of his first pieces, "Timbuktu".<ref>Friedlander, Ed. "[http://www.pathguy.com/timbuc.htm Enjoying "Timbuktu" by Alfred Tennyson]"</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/lincolnshire/asop/people/alfred_tennyson.shtml|title= Lincolnshire People – Famous Yellowbellies – Alfred, Lord Tennyson|date=31 August 2005|publisher=BBC|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050831192254/http://www.bbc.co.uk/lincolnshire/asop/people/alfred_tennyson.shtml|archive-date=2005-08-31|access-date=26 March 2018}}</ref> Reportedly, "it was thought to be no slight honour for a young man of twenty to win the chancellor's gold medal".<ref name="Parsons"/> He published his first solo collection of poems, ''Poems Chiefly Lyrical'' in 1830. "Claribel" and "[[Mariana (poem)|Mariana]]", which later took their place among Tennyson's most celebrated poems, were included in this volume. Although decried by some critics as overly sentimental, his verse soon proved popular and brought Tennyson to the attention of well-known writers of the day, including [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]].

==Return to Lincolnshire, second publication, Epping Forest==
In the spring of 1831, Tennyson's father died, requiring him to leave [[Cambridge]] before taking his degree. He returned to the rectory, where he was permitted to live for another six years and shared responsibility for his widowed mother and the family. [[Arthur Hallam]] came to stay with his family during the summer and became engaged to Tennyson's sister, Emilia Tennyson.

[[File:John William Waterhouse - The Lady of Shalott - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John William Waterhouse]]'s ''[[The Lady of Shalott (painting)|The Lady of Shalott]]'', 1888 ([[Tate Britain]], London)]]

In 1833 Tennyson published his second book of poetry, which notably included the first version of "[[The Lady of Shalott]]". The volume met heavy criticism, which so discouraged Tennyson that he did not publish again for ten years, although he did continue to write. That same year, Hallam died suddenly and unexpectedly after suffering a [[cerebral haemorrhage]] while on a holiday in [[Vienna]]. Hallam's death had a profound effect on Tennyson and inspired several poems, including "In the Valley of Cauteretz" and "[[In Memoriam A.H.H.]]", a long poem detailing the "Way of the Soul".<ref name="H. Tennyson, 1897">H. Tennyson (1897). ''Alfred Lord Tennyson: A Memoir by His Son'', New York: MacMillan.</ref>

Tennyson and his family were allowed to stay in the rectory for some time, but later moved to Beech Hill Park, [[High Beach]], deep within [[Epping Forest]], [[Essex, England|Essex]], about 1837. Tennyson's son recalled: “there was a pond in the park on which in winter my father might be seen skating, sailing about on the ice in his long blue cloak. He liked the nearness of London, whither he resorted to see his friends, but he could not stay in town even for a night, his mother being in such a nervous state that he did not like to leave her...".<ref name="H. Tennyson, 1897"/> Tennyson befriended a Dr Allen, who ran a nearby asylum whose patients then included the poet [[John Clare]].<ref>[http://highbeachchurch.org/WhosWhoatHolyInnocents.aspx "History of Holy Innocents Church"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320145841/http://highbeachchurch.org/WhosWhoatHolyInnocents.aspx |date=20 March 2012 }}, Highbeachchurch.org. Retrieved 27 April 2012</ref> An unwise investment in Dr Allen's ecclesiastical wood-carving enterprise soon led to the loss of much of the family fortune, and led to a bout of serious depression.<ref name="H. Tennyson, 1897"/> Tennyson moved to London in 1840 and lived for a time at [[Chapel House, Twickenham]].

==Third publication==
<!--only last paragraph has citations-->

On 14 May 1842, while living modestly in London, Tennyson published the two volume ''[[Poems (Tennyson, 1842)|Poems]]'', of which the first included works already published and the second was made up almost entirely of new poems. They met with immediate success; poems from this collection, such as "[[Locksley Hall]]", "[[Break, Break, Break]]", and "[[Ulysses (poem)|Ulysses]]", and a new version of "[[The Lady of Shalott]]", have met enduring fame. "[[The Princess (Tennyson poem)|The Princess: A Medley]]", a satire on women's education that came out in 1847, was also popular for its lyrics. [[W.&nbsp;S. Gilbert]] later adapted and parodied the piece twice: in ''[[The Princess (play)|The Princess]]'' (1870) and in ''[[Princess Ida]]'' (1884).

It was in 1850 that Tennyson reached the pinnacle of his career, finally publishing his masterpiece, "[[In Memoriam A.H.H.]]", dedicated to Hallam. Later the same year, he was appointed [[Poet Laureate]], succeeding [[William Wordsworth]]. In the same year (on 13 June), Tennyson married [[Emily Tennyson|Emily Sellwood]], whom he had known since childhood, in the village of [[Shiplake]]. They had two sons, [[Hallam Tennyson]] (b.&nbsp;11 August 1852)—named after his friend—and Lionel (b.&nbsp;16 March 1854).

Tennyson rented [[Farringford House]] on the [[Isle of Wight]] in 1853, eventually buying it in 1856.<ref>[http://www.farringford.co.uk/history.php ''The Home of Tennyson''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224042836/http://www.farringford.co.uk/history.php |date=24 December 2007 }} Rebecca FitzGerald, [http://www.farringford.co.uk/index.php Farringford: The Home of Tennyson]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204063836/http://www.farringford.co.uk/index.php |date=4 December 2008 }} official website</ref> He eventually found that there were too many [[wikt:star-struck|starstruck]] tourists who pestered him in Farringford, so he moved to [[Blackdown, Sussex|Aldworth]], in [[West Sussex]] in 1869.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-410472-aldworth-house-lurgashall-west-sussex|title=Aldworth House – Lurgashall – West Sussex – England – British Listed Buildings|author=Good Stuff|work=britishlistedbuildings.co.uk}}</ref> However, he retained Farringford, and regularly returned there to spend the winters.

==Poet Laureate==
In 1850, after William Wordsworth's death and [[Samuel Rogers]]' refusal, Tennyson was appointed to the position of Poet Laureate; [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]] and [[Leigh Hunt]] had also been considered.<ref name="Batchelor">Batchelor, John. ''Tennyson: To Strive, To Seek, To Find.'' London: Chatto and Windus, 2012.</ref> He held the position until his own death in 1892, the longest tenure of any laureate. Tennyson fulfilled the requirements of this position, such as by authoring a poem of greeting to [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess Alexandra of Denmark]] when she arrived in Britain to marry the future King [[Edward VII]]. In 1855, Tennyson produced one of his best-known works, "[[The Charge of the Light Brigade (poem)|The Charge of the Light Brigade]]", a dramatic tribute to the British cavalrymen involved in [[Charge of the Light Brigade|an ill-advised charge]] on 25 October 1854, during the [[Crimean War]]. Other esteemed works written in the post of Poet Laureate include "Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington" and "Ode Sung at the Opening of the International Exhibition".

Tennyson initially declined a [[baronet]]cy in 1865 and 1868 (when tendered by [[Disraeli]]), finally accepting a [[peerage]] in 1883 at [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]]'s earnest solicitation. In 1884 Victoria created him '''Baron Tennyson''', of Aldworth in the County of Sussex and of [[Freshwater, Isle of Wight|Freshwater in the Isle of Wight]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=25308 |date=15 January 1884 |page=243}}</ref> He took his seat in the House of Lords on 11 March 1884.<ref name="Parsons"/>

Tennyson also wrote a substantial quantity of unofficial political verse, from the bellicose "Form, Riflemen, Form", on the French crisis of 1859 and the [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)#Creation of the Volunteer Force|Creation of the Volunteer Force]], to "Steersman, be not precipitate in thine act/of steering", deploring Gladstone's [[Home Rule Bill]]. Tennyson's family were [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] by tradition and Tennyson's own politics fitted the Whig mould, although he would also vote for the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] after the Whigs dissolved.<ref name="Pearsall">{{cite book |last1=Pearsall |first1=Cornelia D.J. |title=Tennyson's Rapture: Transformation in the Victorian Dramatic Monologue |url=https://archive.org/details/tennysonsrapture00pear |url-access=limited |date=2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/tennysonsrapture00pear/page/n48 38]–44|isbn=978-0-19-515054-4 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Ormond |first1=Leonee |title=Alfred Tennyson: A Literary Life |date=1993 |publisher=Springer |page=146}}</ref> Tennyson believed that society should progress through gradual and steady reform, not revolution, and this attitude was reflected in his attitude toward universal suffrage, which he did not outright reject, but recommended only after the masses had been properly educated and adjusted to self-government.<ref name="Pearsall" /> Upon passage of the [[1832 Reform Act]], Tennyson broke into a local church to ring the bells in celebration.<ref name="Pearsall" />

[[Virginia Woolf]] wrote a play called ''Freshwater'', showing Tennyson as host to his friends [[Julia Margaret Cameron]] and [[George Frederic Watts|G. F. Watts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.primaveraproductions.com/index.php?area=productions&subarea=single&id=21%7ctitle=primaveraproductions.com%7cwork=primaveraproductions.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923175341/http://www.primaveraproductions.com/index.php?area=productions&subarea=single&id=21%7ctitle=primaveraproductions.com%7cwork=primaveraproductions.com|url-status=dead|archive-date=2015-09-23|title=primaveraproductions.com}}</ref>

Colonel [[George Edward Gouraud]], [[Thomas Edison]]'s European agent, made sound recordings of Tennyson reading his own poetry, late in his life. They include recordings of "The Charge of the Light Brigade", and excerpts from "The splendour falls" (from The Princess), "Come into the garden" (from [[Maud and other poems|Maud]]), "Ask me no more", "Ode on the death of the Duke of Wellington" and "Lancelot and Elaine". The sound quality is poor, as wax cylinder recordings usually are.

Towards the end of his life Tennyson revealed that his "religious beliefs also defied convention, leaning towards agnosticism and [[pandeism]]":<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cambridgeprints.com/newacquisitionsbooks.htm |title=Cambridge Book and Print Gallery |access-date=31 August 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311022152/http://www.cambridgeprints.com/newacquisitionsbooks.htm |archive-date=11 March 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In a characteristically Victorian manner, Tennyson combines a deep interest in contemporary science with an unorthodox, even idiosyncratic, Christian belief.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/tennyson/tenny1.html|title=Tennyson, Science and Religion|website=victorianweb.org}}</ref> Famously, he wrote in ''In Memoriam'': "There lives more faith in honest doubt, believe me, than in half the creeds." In ''Maud'', 1855, he wrote: "The churches have killed their Christ". In "[[Locksley Hall Sixty Years After]]", Tennyson wrote: "Christian love among the churches look'd the twin of heathen hate." In his play, ''[[Becket (Tennyson play)|Becket]]'', he wrote: "We are self-uncertain creatures, and we may, Yea, even when we know not, mix our spites and private hates with our defence of Heaven". Tennyson recorded in his ''Diary'' (p.&nbsp;127): "I believe in [[Pantheism]] of a sort". His son's biography confirms that Tennyson was an unorthodox Christian, noting that Tennyson praised [[Giordano Bruno]] and [[Spinoza]] on his deathbed, saying of Bruno, "His view of God is in some ways mine", in 1892.<ref>[http://ffrf.org/day/?day=6&month=8 Freethought of the Day, 6 August 2006, Alfred Tennyson] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20121203013326/http://ffrf.org/day/?day=6&month=8 |date=3 December 2012 }}</ref>

[[File:Tennyson Monument, Tennyson Down, IW, UK.jpg|thumb|upright=.9|Monument to Tennyson on [[Tennyson Down]], Isle of Wight]]
Tennyson continued writing into his eighties. He died on 6 October 1892 at Aldworth, aged 83. He was buried at [[Westminster Abbey]].<ref>[[Arthur Penrhyn Stanley|Stanley, A.P.]], ''Historical Memorials of Westminster Abbey'' ([[London]]; [[John Murray (publishing house)|John Murray]]; [[1882]]), p. 240.</ref> A memorial was erected in [[All Saints' Church, Freshwater]].

He was succeeded as 2nd Baron Tennyson by his son, [[Hallam Tennyson, 2nd Baron Tennyson|Hallam]], who produced an authorised biography of his father in 1897, and was later the second [[Governor-General of Australia]].

==Tennyson and the Queen==
Although [[Albert, Prince Consort|Albert, Prince Consort]] was largely responsible for Tennyson's appointment as Laureate,<ref name=" Batchelor" /> [[Queen Victoria]] became an ardent admirer of Tennyson's work, writing in her diary that she was "much soothed & pleased" by reading "[[In Memoriam A.H.H.]]" after Albert's death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenvictoriasjournals.org/home.do|title=Queen Victoria's Journals – Information Site|date= 5 January 1862 |work=queenvictoriasjournals.org}}</ref>

The two met twice, first in April 1862, when Victoria wrote in her diary, "very peculiar looking, tall, dark, with a fine head, long black flowing hair & a beard, oddly dressed, but there is no affectation about him."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenvictoriasjournals.org/home.do|title=Queen Victoria's Journals – Information Site|date= 14 April 1862|work=queenvictoriasjournals.org}}</ref>

Tennyson met her a second time just over two decades later, on 7 August 1883, and the Queen told him what a comfort "In Memoriam A.H.H." had been.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenvictoriasjournals.org/home.do|title=Queen Victoria's Journals – Information Site|date=7 August 1883 |work=queenvictoriasjournals.org}}</ref>

==The art of Tennyson's poetry==
As source material for his poetry, Tennyson used a wide range of subject matter ranging from medieval legends to classical myths and from domestic situations to observations of nature. The influence of [[John Keats]] and other [[Romantic poets]] published before and during his childhood is evident from the richness of his imagery and descriptive writing.<ref name="felix grendon">{{cite journal|last1=Grendon|first1=Felix|title=The Influence of Keats upon the Early Poetry of Tennyson|journal=The Sewanee Review|date=July 1907|volume=15|issue=3|pages=285–296|url=https://archive.org/stream/jstor-27530858/27530858_djvu.txt|access-date=24 October 2014}}</ref> He also handled rhythm masterfully. The insistent beat of ''Break, Break, Break'' emphasises the relentless sadness of the subject matter. Tennyson's use of the musical qualities of words to emphasise his rhythms and meanings is sensitive. The language of "I come from haunts of coot and hern" lilts and ripples like the brook in the poem and the last two lines of "Come down O maid from yonder mountain height" illustrate his telling combination of [[onomatopoeia]], [[alliteration]], and [[assonance]]:

{{poemquote|The moan of doves in immemorial elms
And murmuring of innumerable bees.}}

Tennyson was a craftsman who polished and revised his manuscripts extensively, to the point where his efforts at self-editing were described by his contemporary [[Robert Browning]] as "insane", symptomatic of "mental infirmity".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Baker|first1=John Haydn|title=Browning and Wordsworth|date=2004|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press|location=Cranbury NJ|isbn=0838640389|page=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_sj4SoOOutwC |access-date=24 October 2014}}</ref> His complex compositional practice and frequent redrafting also demonstrates a dynamic relationship between images and text, as can be seen in the many notebooks he worked in.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tennyson|url=https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/collections/tennyson|publisher=University of Cambridge|access-date=5 October 2017}}</ref> Few poets have used such a variety of styles with such an exact understanding of [[meter (poetry)|metre]]; like many Victorian poets, he experimented in adapting the [[Meter (poetry)#Greek and Latin|quantitative metres]] of Greek and Latin poetry to English.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pattison|first1=Robert|title=Tennyson and Tradition|date=1979|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0674874153|page=[https://archive.org/details/tennysontraditio0000patt/page/106 106]|url=https://archive.org/details/tennysontraditio0000patt|url-access=registration|access-date=24 October 2014}}</ref> He reflects the [[Victorian period]] of his maturity in his feeling for order and his tendency towards moralising. He also reflects a concern common among [[Victorian literature|Victorian writers]] in being troubled by the conflict between religious faith and expanding scientific knowledge.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gossin|first1=Pamela|title=Encyclopedia of Literature and Science|date=2002|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|location=Westport CT|isbn=0313305382|page=461|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bVuFgBtdksEC |access-date=24 October 2014}}</ref> Tennyson possessed a strong poetic power, which his early readers often attributed to his "Englishness" and his masculinity.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sherwood|first1=Marion|title=Tennyson and the Fabrication of Englishness|date=2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=978-1137288899|pages=69–70|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g9MdzPJ7UfwC&pg=PA69 |access-date=6 December 2014}}</ref> Well known among his longer works are ''Maud'' and ''Idylls of the King'', the latter arguably the most famous Victorian adaptation of the legend of [[King Arthur]] and the [[Knights of the Round Table]]. A common thread of grief, melancholy, and loss connects much of his poetry (including ''Mariana'', ''The Lotos Eaters'', ''Tears, Idle Tears'', ''In Memoriam''), possibly reflecting Tennyson's own lifelong struggle with debilitating depression.<ref>{{cite journal |first=David G. |last=Riede |title=Tennyson's Poetics of Melancholy and the Imperial Imagination |journal=Studies in English Literature |volume=40 |issue=4 |year=2000 |pages=659–678 |doi=10.1353/sel.2000.0040 |s2cid=154831984 }}</ref> T.&nbsp;S. Eliot famously described Tennyson as "the saddest of all English poets", whose technical mastery of verse and language provided a "surface" to his poetry's "depths, to the abyss of sorrow".<ref>T. S. Eliot, ''Selected Prose of T.&nbsp;S. Eliot''. Ed. Frank Kermode. New York: Harcourt, 1975. P. 246.</ref> Other poets such as [[W. H. Auden]] maintained a more critical stance, stating that Tennyson was the "stupidest" of all the English poets, adding that: "There was little about melancholia he didn't know; there was little else that he did."<ref>Carol T. Christ, Catherine Robson, ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature, Volume E: The Victorian Age''. Ed. Stephen Greenblatt & M.H. Abrams. New York: Norton, 2006. p. 1111</ref>

==Influence on Pre-Raphaelite artists==

Tennyson's early poetry, with its medievalism and powerful visual imagery, was a major influence on the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]]. In 1848, [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[William Holman Hunt]] made a list of "Immortals", artistic heroes whom they admired, especially from literature, notably including [[John Keats|Keats]] and Tennyson, whose work would form subjects for PRB paintings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/romantics-and-victorians/articles/the-pre-raphaelites|title=The Pre-Raphaelites|website=The British Library}}</ref> ''The Lady of Shalott'' alone was a subject for Rossetti, Hunt, [[John William Waterhouse]] (three versions), and [[Elizabeth Siddall]].

==Tennyson heraldry==

[[File:StatueOfTennyson.jpg|thumbnail|upright|Statue of Lord Tennyson in the chapel of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]]]
[[File:Ottawa Public Library.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Stained glass at [[Ottawa Public Library]] features [[Charles Dickens]], [[Archibald Lampman]], [[Duncan Campbell Scott]], [[Lord Byron]], Alfred, Lord Tennyson, [[William Shakespeare]], [[Thomas Moore]]]]

A [[heraldic achievement]] of Alfred, Lord Tennyson exists in an 1884 stained-glass window in the Hall of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], showing arms: ''Gules, a bend nebuly or thereon a [[Chaplet (headgear)|chaplet]] vert between three leopard's faces [[jessant-de-lys]] of the second''; [[Crest (heraldry)|Crest]]: ''A [[Dexter and sinister|dexter]] arm in armour the hand in a gauntlet or grasping a broken tilting spear enfiled with a garland of laurel''; [[Supporters (heraldry)|Supporters]]: ''Two [[Lions in heraldry|leopards rampant guardant]] gules semée de lys and ducally crowned or''; Motto: ''Respiciens Prospiciens''<ref>Debrett's Peerage, 1968, p. 1091</ref> ("Looking backwards (is) looking forwards"). These are a [[Difference (heraldry)|difference]] of the arms of [[Thomas Tenison]] (1636–1715), [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], themselves a difference of the arms of the 13th-century [[Denys family]] of [[Glamorgan]] and [[Siston]] in Gloucestershire, themselves a difference of the arms of [[Thomas de Cantilupe]] (c. 1218–1282), [[Bishop of Hereford]], henceforth the arms of the [[See of Hereford]]; the name "Tennyson" signifies "Denys's son", although no connection between the two families is recorded.
