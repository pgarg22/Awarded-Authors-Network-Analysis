Storm was born in the small town of [[Husum]], on the west coast of [[Duchy of Schleswig|Schleswig]], then a formally independent duchy ruled by the king of Denmark.<ref name="Stern"/> His parents were the lawyer ''Johann Casimir Storm'' (1790–1874) and ''Lucie Storm'', née Woldsen (1797–1879).

Storm attended school in Husum and [[Lübeck]] and studied law in [[Kiel]] and [[Berlin]].<ref name="Stern"/> While still a law student in [[Kiel University|Kiel]] he published a first volume of verse together with the brothers Tycho and [[Theodor Mommsen]] (1843).

Storm was involved in the [[1848 revolutions]] and sympathized with the [[liberalism|liberal]] goals of a united Germany under a constitutional monarchy in which every class could participate in the political process.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jackson |first1=David A |title=Theodor Storm: The Life and Works of a Democratic Humanitarian |date=1992 |publisher=Berg Publishers |page=201}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Ebersold |first1=Günther |title=Politik und Gesellschaftskritik in den Novellen Theodor Storms |date=1981 |publisher=Peter Lang Verlag |page=13}}</ref> From 1843 until his admission was revoked by Danish authorities in 1852, he worked as a lawyer in his home town of Husum. In 1853 Storm moved to [[Potsdam]], moving on to [[Heilbad Heiligenstadt|Heiligenstadt]] in [[Thuringia]] in 1856. He returned to Husum in 1865 after Schleswig had come under [[Prussia]]n rule and became a district magistrate ("Landvogt"). In 1880 Storm moved to [[Hanerau-Hademarschen|Hademarschen]], where he spent the last years of his life writing, and died of cancer at the age of 70.<ref name="Stern">[http://www.bartleby.com/315/3/1000.html Adolf Stern, Biographical Note in ''The Rider on the White Horse'', The Harvard Classics Shelf of Fiction, 1917]</ref>

Storm was married twice, first to Konstanze Esmarch, who died in 1864, and then to Dorothea Jensen.<ref name="Stern"/>

==Work==
Storm was one of the most important authors of 19th-century German [[Literary realism]]. He wrote a number of stories, poems and novellas. His two best-known works are the novellas [[Immensee (novella)|''Immensee'']] (1849) and ''[[The Rider on the White Horse|Der Schimmelreiter]]'' ("The Rider on the White Horse"), first published in April 1888 in the ''[[Deutsche Rundschau]]''. Other published works include a volume of his poems (1852), the novella ''[[Paul the Puppeteer|Pole Poppenspäler]]'' (1874) and the novella ''[[Aquis Submersus (novella)|Aquis submersus]]'' (1877).

== Analysis ==
Like [[Friedrich Hebbel]], Theodor Storm was a child of the North Sea plain, but, whilst in Hebbel's verse there is hardly any direct reference to his native landscape, Storm again and again revisits the chaste beauty of its expansive mudflats, menacing sea and barren pastures &mdash; and whilst Hebbel could find a home away from his native heath Storm clung to it with what may be called a jealous love. In ''Der Schimmelreiter'', the last of his 50 novellas and widely considered Storm's culminating masterpiece, the setting of the rural North German coast is central to evoking its unnerving, superstitious atmosphere, and sets the stage for the battleground of man versus nature: the dykes and the sea.

His favourite poets were [[Joseph von Eichendorff]] and [[Eduard Mörike]], and the influence of the former is plainly discernible even in Storm's later verse. During a summer visit to [[Baden-Baden]] in 1864, where he had been invited by his friend, the author and painter [[Ludwig Pietsch]], he made the acquaintance of the great Russian writer [[Ivan Turgenev]]. They exchanged letters and sent each other copies of their works over a number of years.

Hungarian literary critic [[György Lukács|Georg Lukács]], in ''[[Soul and Form]]'' (1911), appraised Storm as "the last representative of the great German bourgeois literary tradition," poised between [[Jeremias Gotthelf]] and [[Thomas Mann]].

! The town

| ''Am grauen Strand, am grauen Meer<br>Und seitab liegt die Stadt;<br>Der Nebel drückt die Dächer schwer,<br>Und durch die Stille braust das Meer<br>Eintönig um die Stadt.''
| By the grey shore, by the grey sea<br>&mdash;And close by lies the town&mdash;<br>The fog rests heavy round the roofs<br>And through the silence roars the sea<br>Monotonously round the town.
|-
| ''Es rauscht kein Wald, es schlägt im Mai<br>Kein Vogel ohn' Unterlaß;<br>Die Wandergans mit hartem Schrei<br>Nur fliegt in Herbstesnacht vorbei,<br>Am Strande weht das Gras.''
| No forest murmurs, no bird sings<br>Unceasingly in May;<br>The wand'ring goose with raucous cry<br>On autumn nights just passes by,<br>On the shoreline waves the grass.
|-
| ''Doch hängt mein ganzes Herz an dir,<br>Du graue Stadt am Meer;<br>Der Jugend Zauber für und für<br>Ruht lächelnd doch auf dir, auf dir,<br>Du graue Stadt am Meer.''
| Yet all my heart remains with you,<br>O grey town by the sea;<br>Youth's magic ever and a day<br>Rests smiling still on you, on you,<br>O grey town by the sea.
