'''Roger Joseph McGough''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CBE|FRSL}} ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|ɡ|ɒ|f}}; born 9 November 1937) is an English poet, performance poet, broadcaster, children's author and playwright. He presents the [[BBC Radio 4]] programme ''[[Poetry Please]]'', as well as performing his own poetry. McGough was one of the leading members of the [[Liverpool poets]], a group of young poets influenced by [[Beat poetry]] and the popular [[Beat music|music]] and [[Culture of Liverpool|culture]] of 1960s [[Liverpool]]. He is an honorary fellow of [[Liverpool John Moores University]], fellow of the [[Royal Society of Literature]] and President of the [[Poetry Society]].<ref>[http://www.poetrysociety.org.uk/content/aboutus/ The Poetry Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504140414/http://www.poetrysociety.org.uk/content/aboutus |date=4 May 2009 }} – accessed 24 July 2009</ref>

==Early life==
McGough was born in [[Litherland]], [[Lancashire]], on the outskirts of [[Liverpool]], to Roger Francis, a docker, and Mary (McGarry) McGough.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryarchive.org/poetryarchive/singlePoet.do?poetId=4678|title=Roger McGough - poetryarchive.org}}</ref><ref name="encyclopedia" /> His ancestry is Irish and he was raised in the [[Roman Catholic]] faith.<ref>McGough, ''Said and Done'', pp. 12, 23</ref> He was a pupil at [[St Mary's College, Crosby|St Mary's College]] in [[Crosby, Merseyside|Crosby]] with [[Laurie Taylor (sociologist)|Laurie Taylor]], future sociologist and criminologist, before going on to study French and Geography at the [[University of Hull]].<ref name="guardianint">[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/nov/14/poetry.shopping Emma Brockes interview: Roger McGough] ''The Guardian'' 14 November 2005</ref> McGough lived in one of the university residences, [[Needler Hall]], for three years from 1955 and served as hall librarian. Contemporaneously, the poet [[Philip Larkin]] became the university's librarian; newly arrived at Hull, he served as a sub-warden at Needler Hall, though he lived in private accommodation nearby.<ref>McGough, ''Said and Done'' pp. 78–81.</ref> Several years later McGough corresponded with Larkin about poetry, sending him some of his own poems as he still lacked the confidence to approach the man directly. Larkin replied, thanking McGough for the poetry, which he had enjoyed reading. He added that he believed that McGough walked an impressionistic tightrope which, though exhilarating, meant that on occasion he fell off.<ref>McGough, ''Said and Done'' p. 85.</ref>

==The Scaffold and Grimms==
Returning to Merseyside in the early 1960s, he worked as a French teacher and, with [[John Gorman (musician)|John Gorman]], organised arts events.  McGough and Gorman later met [[Mike McGear]] (Mike McCartney) and together formed the trio [[The Scaffold]]; they worked the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] until they were signed to [[Parlophone]] records in 1966. The Scaffold performed a mixture of comic songs, comedy sketches and the poetry of McGough. The group scored several hit records, reaching [[Chart-topper|number one]] in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 1968 with their version of "[[Lily the Pink (song)|Lily the Pink]]". McGough wrote the lyrics for many of the group's songs and also recorded the musical comedy/poetry album ''McGough and McGear''.<ref name="guardianint" />

In 1971 ''[[Grimms]]'' was formed, originally as a merger of the Scaffold, the [[Bonzo Dog Band]] and the [[Liverpool poets|Liverpool Scene]]. Group member [[Neil Innes]] said about the formation of the group: "I don't know what attracted the Scaffold to the Bonzos; we were incredibly anarchic, which was probably something shared by the Scaffold as well."<ref name="Bowen">Bowen, Phil. (2008) ''A Gallery to Play to: The Story of the Mersey Poets.''  Liverpool University Press. pp.104–106.</ref>

==Poetry==
As a poet, McGough came to national prominence through the publication of ''[[The Mersey Sound (book)|The Mersey Sound]]'' in 1967. ''The Mersey Sound'' is an [[anthology]] of poetry by three Liverpool poets: McGough, [[Brian Patten]], and [[Adrian Henri]].<ref name=oxfordjournals>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070705082703/http://www.oxfordjournals.org/our_journals/ywes/online/Volume_80/Issue_03/pdf/mae014.pdf "XIV Modern Literature, section 5", John Brannigan] Accessed 9 April 2006</ref> It went on to sell over 500,000 copies, becoming one of the bestselling poetry anthologies of all time; remaining in continuous publication, it was revised in 1983 and again in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-life-features/liverpool-special-features/2007/10/06/something-to-really-bragg-about-64375-19905088/|title=Liverpool Echo: Latest Liverpool and Merseyside news, sports and what's on}}</ref> The title of the anthology was a conscious association of the three Liverpool poets with the musical phenomenon caused by the eruption of [[the Beatles]] and associated bands from the same city, known collectively as the "[[Beat music|Merseybeat]]", on the world. McGough's personal connection with the Beatles was referenced in a much later comic poem, "To Macca's Trousers", contained in the book ''That Awkward Age'' (2009). McGough discovered a long forgotten pair of [[Paul McCartney]]'s blue mohair trousers in his attic; the trousers had been given to him, via McCartney's brother Mike, in the early 1960s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-news/regional-news/2009/05/11/liverpool-poet-roger-mcgough-s-ode-to-macca-s-trousers-92534-23590054/|title=Liverpool Echo: Latest Liverpool and Merseyside news, sports and what's on}}</ref>

One of McGough's early poems, ''Let Me Die a Youngman's Death'' (but not, as the poem states, before the poet reaches 73, 91 or 104 years of age), was included in a [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] anthology of the British nation's hundred favourite poems.<ref>Bowen, Phil., (2008) ''A Gallery to Play to: The Story of the Mersey Poets.'' Liverpool University Press. p. 67</ref> McGough has been nicknamed "the patron saint of poetry" by [[Carol Ann Duffy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/older-wiser-angrier-roger-mcgough-settles-some-old-scores-8053567.html|title=Older, wiser, angrier: Roger McGough settles some old scores|date=18 August 2012}}</ref>

Philip Larkin included McGough's poetry in ''[[The Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse]]'', which he edited in 1973. Writing to McGough in 1980, Larkin congratulated him on the well-thumbed state of the copies of his books in Hull University's library, when compared to Larkin's own.<ref>McGough, ''Said and Done'', p. 97</ref>

Possibly his shortest, most memorable and overtly political poem, was entitled "Conservative Government Unemployment Figures". The text of poem repeats the words of the title, with layout and punctuation resulting in an arch critique.<ref>McGough,Collected Poems, p. 182</ref> The poem was referenced in a parliamentary debate in the [[House of Commons]] in 2004.<ref>House of Commons Hansard Debates for 1 Dec 2004 (pt 35)</ref>

The poetry of McGough has been the subject of academic study. It has been characterised, at least from its early examples, as being reliant on play with words and their meanings. It has also been noted to exhibit a stylised wit, and, at times, a sadness based on themes of lost youth, unfulfilled relationships, and the downside of city life. The form of some of his verse, it has been claimed, has been influenced by his experience of writing song lyrics.<ref>Booth, Martin (1985) ''British Poetry 1964–1984: Driving Through the Barricades.'' Routledge, pp.  138–139</ref> A major critical examination of McGough's poetry, by American academic Ben Wright, was published in 2006. The author's stated aim was "to examine and evaluate the accessibility of Roger McGough's message to a wide, general readership, as well as appraising it by the most rigorous literary standards". McGough's popularity, commercial success, use of humour, and the lack of pretension of his verse has tended to restrict appreciation of his work as "serious poetry". Wright's study challenges this under-appreciation.<ref>Wright, Ben, Allan (2006) ''The Poetry of Roger McGough: The Liverpool Renaissance''. Edwin Mellen Press.</ref>

On 2 March 1978, McGough appeared in ''[[All You Need Is Cash]]'', a mockumentary detailing the career of a Beatles-like group called [[the Rutles]]. Interviewed by [[Eric Idle]], the introduction of McGough takes so long that he is only asked one question, "Did you know the Rutles?" to which McGough cheerfully responds "Oh yes", before the documentary is forced to move along to other events. In 1980 he recited a high-speed one-minute version of [[Longfellow]]'s poem "[[The Wreck of the Hesperus]]", complete with sound effects, on the album ''Miniatures'' produced by [[Morgan Fisher]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.morgan-fisher.com/discogpages_e/miniatures.html|title=morgan fisher miniatures|publisher=Morgan Fisher | access-date=5 September 2019}}</ref>

One of McGough's more unusual compositions was created in 1981, when he co-wrote an "electronic poem" called ''Now Press Return'' with the programmer Richard Warner for inclusion with the ''Welcome Tape'' of the [[BBC Micro]] home computer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbcbasic.co.uk/bbcbasic/birthday/index.html|title=R.T.Russell: Happy Birthday BBC BASIC!}}</ref> ''Now Press Return'' incorporated several novel themes, including user-defined elements to the poem, lines which changed their order (and meaning) every few seconds, and text which wrote itself in a spiral around the screen.<ref>[http://bbc.nvg.org/doc/Welcome.pdf BBC [pdf&#93;]</ref> He made a programme in 1991 for [[Channel 4]] called ''Equinox: The Elements'' about the [[chemical element|elements]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.windfallfilms.com/show/1216/equinox-the-elements.aspx|title=Equinox: The Elements – Windfall Films|access-date=16 October 2016}}</ref> He made a guest appearance on quiz panel show ''[[QI]]'' in 2006.

Three plays written by the 17th-century French playwright [[Molière]] have been translated by McGough and directed by Gemma Bodinetz. ''[[Tartuffe]]'' premièred at the [[Liverpool Playhouse]] in May 2008 and transferred subsequently to the [[Rose Theatre, Kingston]].<ref>Philip Key, [http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-life-features/liverpool-arts/2008/05/14/theatre-review-tartuffe-roger-mcgough-liverpool-playhouse-64375-20906148/ Tartuffe, Roger McGough, Liverpool Playhouse], ''[[Liverpool Daily Post]]'' (15 May 2008)</ref> ''The Hypochondriac'' (''[[The Imaginary Invalid]]'') was staged at the Liverpool Playhouse in July 2009.<ref name="Guardian">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/jul/01/hypochondriac-liverpool-playhouse-review|title=The Hypochondriac|first=Alfred|last=Hickling|date=30 June 2009|work=The Guardian}}</ref> ''[[The Misanthrope]]'' was staged at the Liverpool Playhouse in February–March 2013 before touring with the [[English Touring Theatre]].
