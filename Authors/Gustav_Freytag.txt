'''Gustav Freytag''' ({{IPA-de|ˈfʁaɪˌtaːk|lang}}; 13 July 1816 &ndash; 30 April 1895) was a German novelist and playwright.

==Life==
Freytag was born in [[Kluczbork|Kreuzburg (Kluczbork)]] in [[Province of Silesia|Silesia]]. After attending the school at [[Oleśnica|Oels (Oleśnica)]], he studied [[philology]] at the universities of [[University of Wrocław|Breslau (Wrocław)]] and [[University of Berlin|Berlin]], and in 1838 received his degree with a dissertation titled ''De initiis poeseos scenicae apud Germanos''<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|wstitle=Freytag, Gustav |volume=11 |page=212 |inline=1}}</ref> (''Über die Anfänge der dramatischen Poesie bei den Germanen'', English: ''On the Beginnings of Dramatic Poetry among the Germans'').<ref name="Coburg">Harald Bachmann: ''Gustav Freytag (1816–1895)''. In: ''Coburger Geschichtsblätter.'' 3/1995, Historische Gesellschaft Coburg e.&nbsp;V., S. 121–122</ref> He became member of the student corps ''Borussia zu Breslau''.<ref>See [[:de:Corps Borussia Breslau zu Köln und Aachen|Corps Borussia Breslau zu Köln und Aachen]]</ref>

In 1839, he settled in [[Wrocław|Breslau]], as ''[[Privatdozent]]'' in German language and [[German literature|literature]], but devoted his principal attention to writing for the stage, achieving considerable success with the comedy drama ''Die Brautfahrt, oder Kunz von der Rosen'' (1844). This was followed by a volume of unimportant poems, ''In Breslau'' (1845), and the dramas ''Die Valentine'' (1846) and ''Graf Waldemar'' (1847). He at last attained a prominent position by his comedy, [[The Journalists (1852 play)|The Journalists (1852)]], one of the best German comedies of the 19th century.<ref name=EB1911/>

In 1847, he moved to Berlin, and in the following year took over, in conjunction with [[Heinrich Julian Schmidt|Julian Schmidt]], the editorship of ''Die Grenzboten'', a weekly journal which, founded in 1841, now became the leading organ of German and Austrian [[liberalism]]. Freytag helped to conduct it until 1861, and again from 1867 till 1870, when for a short time he edited a new periodical, ''Im neuen Reich''.<ref name=EB1911/>  In 1863 he developed what is known as [[Freytag's pyramid]].

Freytag died in [[Wiesbaden]] on 30 April 1895.

==Works==

===''Debit and Credit''===
Freytag's literary fame was made universal by the publication in 1855 of his novel, ''Soll und Haben'' (''[[Debit and Credit]]''), which was translated into almost all European languages.<ref name=EB1911/> It was translated into English by [[Georgiana Harcourt]] in 1857.

It was hailed as one of the best German novels and praised for its sturdy but unexaggerated realism. Its main purpose is the recommendation of the German middle class as the soundest element in the nation, but it also has a more directly patriotic intention in the contrast it draws between the supposedly homely virtues of the German, while presenting in negative light [[Poles]] and [[Jews]].<ref name=EB1911/> In the novel a Jewish merchant is presented as a villain and threat to Germany.<ref>Antisemitism: a historical encyclopedia of prejudice and persecution, Volume 1 page 165</ref> German colonists are presented as "superior" to "wild", "inferior" and "uncivilized" Poles who are also shown sometimes in racist terms.<ref>''Germany and Eastern Europe: Cultural Identity and Cultural Differences''; Keith Bullivant, Geoffrey Giles, Walter Pape, page 133. Jurgen Lieskounig "Branntweintrinkende Wilde" Beyond Civilization and Outside History: The Depiction of the Poles in Gustav Freytag's "Soll und Haben"</ref> The novel affirmed the claim of German "masters" to seize the land of the "weaker race" justified by supposedly "superior" German culture.<ref>IGermany and Eastern Europe: Cultural Identity and Cultural Differences Keith Bullivant, Geoffrey Giles, Walter Pape, page 134 Jurgen Lieskounig "Branntweintrinkende Wilde" Beyond Civilization and Outside History: The Depiction of the Poles in Gustav Freytag's "Soll und Haben"</ref> The novel applied blatant racism to Slavs while focusing on Poles; author stated that Poles have "no culture" and are unable to create civilization. Freytag also claimed that Poles will only become proper human beings through German rule and colonization, and giving up their language and culture. Soll und Haben set an example for a body of colonial literature about the "eastern marches" and also started a public-reinterpretation of the Ostsiedlung, which was now presented as historical mission of the Germans (''Kulturträger''), legitimizing continued occupation of Polish areas and suppressions of Polish population.<ref>Imperial rule Alfred J. Rieber, pages 57–58, Central European University Press.</ref>

===''Die verlorene Handschrift''===
At the duke's request, Freytag was attached to the staff of the Crown Prince of Prussia in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870–71, and was present at the Battles of [[Battle of Wœrth|Wörth]] and [[Battle of Sedan|Sedan]]. Before this, he had published another novel, ''Die verlorene Handschrift'' (1864), in which he endeavoured to do for German university life what ''Soll und Haben'' had done for commercial life. The hero is a young German professor, who is so wrapped up in his search for a manuscript by [[Tacitus]] that he is oblivious to an impending tragedy in his domestic life. The book was, however, less successful than its predecessor.<ref name=EB1911/>

===''Bilder aus der deutschen Vergangenheit''===
Between 1859 and 1867, Freytag published in five volumes ''Bilder aus der deutschen Vergangenheit'', a work on popular lines, illustrating the history and manners of Germany. In 1872, he began a work with a similar patriotic purpose, ''Die Ahnen'', a series of historical romances in which he unfolds the history of a German family from the earliest times to the middle of the 19th century. This series comprises the following novels:<ref name=EB1911/>

===Political activity===
Freytag authored anti-Polish pamphlets. In 1863 Freytag commented that if Poles ever get free from Russian rule in Russian Partition, then Germany should conquer them, stating "We shall make their land German" and that the Poles are facing not the German government but "the entire German nation".<ref>''Literary and cultural images of a nation without a state:
the case of nineteenth-century Poland''. By Agnieszka Barbara Nance. pp. 45–46.</ref> 
Being a native of a province which in his mind owed everything to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], he was an earnest champion of Prussian hegemony over Germany. His powerful advocacy of this idea in his ''Grenzboten'' gained him the friendship of the Duke of [[Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]], whose neighbor he had become, on acquiring the estate of Siebleben near [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]].

===Complete works===
Freytag's ''Gesammelte Werke'' were published in 22 volumes, at [[Leipzig]] (1886–1888); his ''Vermischte Aufsatze'' have been edited by E. Elster, autobiography mentioned above, the lives by C. Alberti (Leipzig, 1890) and F. Seiler (Leipzig, 1898).
