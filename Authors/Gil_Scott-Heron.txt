His music, most notably on the albums ''[[Pieces of a Man]]'' and ''[[Winter in America]]'' in the early 1970s, influenced and foreshadowed later [[African-American music]] genres such as [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[neo soul]]. His recording work received much critical acclaim, especially for ''The Revolution Will Not Be Televised''.<ref name="Azpiri"/> [[AllMusic]]'s John Bush called him "one of the most important progenitors of [[rap music]]", stating that "his aggressive, no-nonsense street poetry inspired a legion of intelligent rappers while his engaging songwriting skills placed him square in the [[rhythm and blues|R&B]] charts later in his career."<ref name="a"/>

Scott-Heron remained active until his death, and in 2010 released his first new album in 16 years, entitled ''[[I'm New Here]]''. A memoir he had been working on for years up to the time of his death, ''The Last Holiday'', was published posthumously in January 2012.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/10/books/the-last-holiday-a-memoir-by-gil-scott-heron-review.html?_r=1&pagewanted=1&partner=rss&emc=rss | work=The New York Times | first=Dwight | last=Garner | title='The Last Holiday: A Memoir' by Gil Scott-Heron – Review | date=January 9, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jan/08/scott-heron-wonder-martin-luther-king | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Gil | last=Scott-Heron | title=How Gil Scott-Heron and Stevie Wonder set up Martin Luther King Day | date=January 8, 2012}}</ref> Scott-Heron received a posthumous [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 2012.

==Early years==
Gil Scott-Heron was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]].<ref name="nyt-obit" /> His mother, Bobbie Scott, was an opera singer who performed with the [[Oratorio Society of New York]]. His father, [[Gil Heron]], nicknamed "The Black Arrow," was a Jamaican footballer who in the 1950s became the first black man to play for [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic Football Club]] in [[Glasgow]], Scotland.<ref name=Dell'Apa>{{cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/sports/soccer/blog/2008/12/giles_heron_pla.html|title=Giles Heron: Played for Celtic, father of musician|first=Frank|last=Dell'Apa|newspaper=[[Boston Globe]]|date=December 4, 2008|access-date= June 2, 2011}}</ref> Gil's parents separated in his early childhood<ref name="newyorker">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/08/09/100809fa_fact_wilkinson|title=New York is Killing Me|magazine=The New Yorker|first=Alec|last=Wilkinson|author-link=Alec Wilkinson|date=August 9, 2010|access-date= May 29, 2011}}</ref> and he was sent to live with his maternal grandmother, Lillie Scott, in [[Jackson, Tennessee]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dacks |first1=David |title=Gil Scott-Heron Pioneering Poet |url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/gil_scott-heron-pioneering_poet |website=exclaim.ca |publisher=[[Exclaim!]] |access-date=June 4, 2018 |language=en |date=February 20, 2010}}</ref><ref>Harold, Claudrena (July 22, 2011), [http://southernspaces.org/2011/deep-cane-southern-soul-gil-scott-heron "Deep in the Cane: The Southern Soul of Gil Scott-Heron"], ''Southern Spaces''.</ref> When Scott-Heron was 12 years old, his grandmother died and he returned to live with his mother in [[The Bronx]] in [[New York City]]. He enrolled at [[DeWitt Clinton High School]],<ref name="newyorker" /> but later transferred to [[The Fieldston School]],<ref name="nyt-obit" /> after impressing the head of the English department with some of his writings and earning a full scholarship.<ref name="newyorker" /> As one of five black students at the prestigious school, Scott-Heron was faced with alienation and a significant socioeconomic gap. During his admissions interview at Fieldston, an administrator asked him: {{"'}}How would you feel if you see one of your classmates go by in a limousine while you're walking up the hill from the subway?' And [he] said, 'Same way as you. Y'all can't afford no limousine. How do you feel?{{'"}}<ref>{{cite journal|last=Weiner|first=Jonah|title=TRIBUTE: Gil Scott-Heron|journal=Rolling Stone|date=June 23, 2011|issue=1133|page=30|url=http://gateway.proquest.com.ezproxy2.library.arizona.edu/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&res_dat=xri:iimp:&rft_dat=xri:iimp:article:citation:iimp00886444}}</ref> This type of intractable boldness would become a hallmark of Scott-Heron's later recordings.

After completing his secondary education, Scott-Heron decided to attend [[Lincoln University (Pennsylvania)|Lincoln University]] in [[Pennsylvania]] because [[Langston Hughes]] (his most important literary influence) was an alumnus. It was here that Scott-Heron met [[Brian Jackson (musician)|Brian Jackson]], with whom he formed the band Black & Blues. After about two years at Lincoln, Scott-Heron took a year off to write the novels ''The Vulture'' and ''The Nigger Factory''.<ref name="Jazzman">{{cite web|url=http://home.clara.net/giaco/gil/bio.htm|title=Gil Scott-Heron Jazz Man – Biography|publisher=Home.clara.net|date=January 21, 2010|access-date=May 28, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030505112836/http://home.clara.net/giaco/gil/bio.htm|archive-date=May 5, 2003}}</ref> Scott-Heron was very heavily influenced by the [[Black Arts Movement]] (BAM). [[The Last Poets]], a group associated with the Black Arts Movement, performed at Lincoln in 1969 and [[Abiodun Oyewole]] of that Harlem group said Scott-Heron asked him after the performance, "Listen, can I start a group like you guys?"<ref name="newyorker"/> Scott-Heron returned to New York City, settling in [[Chelsea, Manhattan]]. ''The Vulture'' was published by the [[World Publishing Company]] in 1970 to positive reviews.

Although Scott-Heron never completed his undergraduate degree, he was admitted to the [[Johns Hopkins Writing Seminars|Writing Seminars]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]], where he received an [[M.A.]] in creative writing in 1972. His master's thesis was titled ''Circle of Stone''.<ref name="Circle of stone">{{cite web|url=https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/catalog/bib_1496828|first=Gil|last=Scott-Heron|title=Circle of stone: a novel|publisher=Catalyst @ Johns Hopkins University|date=1972}}</ref> Beginning in 1972, Scott-Heron taught literature and creative writing for several years as a full-time lecturer at [[University of the District of Columbia]] (then known as Federal City College) in [[Washington, D.C.]] while maintaining his music career.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.criticalimprov.com/article/view/2691/2895 |first=Aldon L. |last=Nielsen |journal=Critical Studies in Improvisation |title=Book Review: ''The Last Holiday: A Memoir'' |volume=8 |number=2 |year=2012}}</ref>

==Recording career==
Scott-Heron began his recording career with the [[Gramophone record|LP]] ''[[Small Talk at 125th and Lenox]]'' in 1970. [[Bob Thiele]] of [[Flying Dutchman Records]] produced the album, and Scott-Heron was accompanied by [[Eddie Knowles]] and [[Charlie Saunders]] on [[conga drum|conga]] and David Barnes on percussion and vocals. The album's 14 tracks dealt with themes such as the superficiality of television and mass consumerism, the hypocrisy of some would-be black revolutionaries, and white middle-class ignorance of the difficulties faced by inner-city residents. In the liner notes, Scott-Heron acknowledged as influences [[Richie Havens]], [[John Coltrane]], [[Otis Redding]], [[Jose Feliciano]], [[Billie Holiday]], [[Langston Hughes]], [[Malcolm X]], [[Huey Newton]], [[Nina Simone]], and long-time collaborator [[Brian Jackson (musician)|Brian Jackson]].

Scott-Heron's 1971 album ''[[Pieces of a Man]]'' used more conventional song structures than the loose, [[spoken-word]] feel of ''Small Talk''. He was joined by Jackson, Johnny Pate as conductor, [[Ron Carter]] on [[Double bass|bass]] and bass guitar, drummer [[Bernard Purdie|Bernard "Pretty" Purdie]], Burt Jones playing electric guitar, and [[Hubert Laws]] on [[flute]] and saxophone, with Thiele producing again. Scott-Heron's third album, ''Free Will'', was released in 1972. Jackson, Purdie, Laws, Knowles, and Saunders all returned to play on ''[[Free Will (Gil Scott-Heron album)|Free Will]]'' and were joined by [[Jerry Jemmott]] playing [[Double bass|bass]], [[David Spinozza]] on guitar, and [[Horace Ott]] (arranger and conductor). Carter later said about Scott-Heron's voice: "He wasn't a great singer, but, with that voice, if he had whispered it would have been dynamic. It was a voice like you would have for Shakespeare."<ref name="newyorker" />

1974 saw another LP collaboration with Brian Jackson, the critically acclaimed opus ''[[Winter in America]]'', with Bob Adams on drums and Danny Bowens on bass. The album contained Scott-Heron's most cohesive material and featured more of Jackson's creative input than his previous albums had. ''Winter in America'' has been regarded by many critics as the two musicians' most artistic effort.<ref name=allmusic>{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p123197|pure_url=yes}} |title= Gil Scott-Heron > Discography > Main Albums |publisher=All Media Guide, LLC. |access-date=July 9, 2008}}</ref><ref name=spin>{{cite book |last=Weisbard |first=Eric |author2=Marks, Craig |title=Spin Alternative Record Guide (Ratings 1–10) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=50cEAAAACAAJ&q=spin%27s+alternative+record |access-date=July 17, 2008 |publisher=Vintage Books |location=New York, NY |date=October 10, 1995 |isbn=0-679-75574-8 |oclc=32508105 |pages= 267–268 |quote=his finest work}}</ref> The following year, Scott-Heron and Jackson released ''[[The First Minute of a New Day|Midnight Band: The First Minute of a New Day]]''. 1975 saw the release of the single "Johannesburg", a rallying cry to the issue of [[apartheid]] in South Africa. The song would be re-issued, in 12"-single form, together with "Waiting for the Axe to Fall" and "B-movie" in 1983.

A live album, ''[[It's Your World (album)|It's Your World]]'', followed in 1976 and a recording of spoken poetry, ''The Mind of Gil Scott-Heron'', was released in 1978.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Gil-Scott-Heron-The-Mind-Of-Gil-Scott-Heron/master/7661|title=Gil Scott-Heron - The Mind Of Gil Scott-Heron|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=July 13, 2019}}</ref> Another success followed with the hit single "Angel Dust", which he recorded as a single with producer [[Malcolm Cecil]]. "Angel Dust" peaked at No. 15 on the [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] charts in 1978.

In 1979, Scott-Heron played at the No Nukes concerts at [[Madison Square Garden]]. The concerts were organized by [[Musicians United for Safe Energy]] to protest the use of [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] following the [[Three Mile Island accident]]. Scott-Heron's song "We Almost Lost Detroit" was included in the ''[[No Nukes (album)|No Nukes]]'' album of concert highlights. It alluded to a previous nuclear power plant accident and was also the title of a book by [[John G. Fuller]]. Scott-Heron was a frequent critic of President [[Ronald Reagan]] and his conservative policies.<ref>[https://www.scotsman.com/sport/black-arrow-gil-heron-a-trailblazer-at-celtic-father-of-famous-jazz-musician-dies-aged-87-1-1150227 "'Black Arrow' Gil Heron a trailblazer at Celtic – Father of famous jazz musician dies aged 87"], ''The Scotsman'' (December 2, 2008).

Scott-Heron recorded and released four albums during the 1980s: ''1980'' and ''[[Real Eyes]]'' (1980), ''Reflections'' (1981) and ''Moving Target'' (1982). In February 1982, [[Ron Holloway]] joined the ensemble to play [[tenor saxophone]]. He toured extensively with Scott-Heron and contributed to his next album, ''Moving Target'' the same year. His tenor accompaniment is a prominent feature of the songs "Fast Lane" and "Black History/The World". Holloway continued with Scott-Heron until the summer of 1989, when he left to join [[Dizzy Gillespie]]. Several years later, Scott-Heron would make cameo appearances on two of Ron Holloway's CDs: ''Scorcher'' (1996) and ''Groove Update'' (1998), both on the Fantasy/Milestone label.<ref name="Encyclopedia">[http://www.jazz.com/encyclopedia/holloway-ron-ronald-edward "Holloway, Ron (Ronald Edward)"], ''Encyclopedia of Jazz Musicians''. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713093533/http://www.jazz.com/encyclopedia/holloway-ron-ronald-edward |date=July 13, 2011 }}.</ref>

Scott-Heron was dropped by [[Arista Records]] in 1985 and quit recording, though he continued to tour. The same year he helped compose and sang "Let Me See Your I.D." on the [[Artists United Against Apartheid]] album ''[[Sun City (album)|Sun City]]'', containing the famous line: "The first time I heard there was trouble in the Middle East, I thought they were talking about Pittsburgh." The song compares racial tensions in the U.S. with those in apartheid-era South Africa, implying that the U.S. was not too far ahead in race relations. In 1993, he signed to [[TVT Records]] and released ''Spirits'', an album that included the seminal track "'Message to the Messengers". The first track on the album criticized the rap artists of the day. Scott-Heron is known in many circles as "the Godfather of [[rapping|rap]]"<ref>{{cite web|last=Feeney|first=John|url=http://growthmadness.org/2007/02/05/economic-his-story-a-la-gil-scott-heron|title=Economic "HIS-story" à la Gil Scott-Heron Growth is Madness!|publisher=Growthmadness.org|date=February 5, 2007|access-date=May 28, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.clara.net/giaco/gil/bio2.htm|title=Gil Scott-Heron Jazz Man – Biography|publisher=Home.clara.net|date=January 21, 2010|access-date=May 28, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925083845/http://home.clara.net/giaco/gil/bio2.htm|archive-date=September 25, 2009}}</ref> and is widely considered to be one of the genre's founding fathers. Given the political consciousness that lies at the foundation of his work, he can also be called a founder of [[political rap]]. "Message to the Messengers" was a plea for the new generation of rappers to speak for change rather than perpetuate the current social situation, and to be more articulate and artistic. Regarding hip hop music in the 1990s, he said in an interview: {{quote|They need to study music. I played in several bands before I began my career as a poet. There's a big difference between putting words over some music, and blending those same words into the music. There's not a lot of humor. They use a lot of slang and colloquialisms, and you don't really see inside the person. Instead, you just get a lot of posturing.<ref name="Salaam">Salaam, Mtume ya, and Kalamu ya Salaam, [http://www.nathanielturner.com/breathoflifegilscottheron.htm "Breath of Life Presents – Gil Scott-Heron & His Music" (reviews)].

In 2001, Scott-Heron was sentenced to one to three years imprisonment in a [[New York State]] prison for possession of [[cocaine]].

On July 5, 2006, Scott-Heron was sentenced to two to four years in a New York State prison for violating a plea deal on a drug-possession charge by leaving a [[Drug rehabilitation|drug rehabilitation center]].

After his release, Scott-Heron began performing live again, starting with a show at SOB's restaurant and nightclub in New York on September 13, 2007.

[[Malik Al Nasir]] dedicated a collection of poetry to Scott-Heron titled ''Ordinary Guy'' that contained a foreword by [[Jalal Mansur Nuriddin]] of [[The Last Poets]]. Scott-Heron recorded one of the poems in Nasir's book entitled ''Black & Blue'' in 2006.

We hope that you will not play apartheid Israel".

===''I'm New Here''===
[[File:Gil Scott-Heron.jpg|thumb|alt=Gil Scott Heron|Scott-Heron performing at the Göta Källare nightclub in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, in 2010]]

Scott-Heron released his album ''[[I'm New Here]]'' on independent label [[XL Recordings]] on February 9, 2010. Produced by XL label owner [[Richard Russell (XL Recordings)|Richard Russell]], ''I'm New Here'' was Scott-Heron's first studio album in 16 years. The pair started recording the album in 2007, with the majority of the record being recorded over the 12 months leading up to the release date with engineer [[Lawson White]] at Clinton Studios in New York. ''I'm New Here'' is 28 minutes long with 15 tracks; however, casual asides and observations collected during recording sessions are included as interludes.<ref name="newyorker" />

The album attracted critical acclaim, with ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s [[Jude Rogers]] declaring it one of the "best of the next decade",<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/nov/19/gil-scott-heron-new-here|title= Best of the next decade: Gil Scott-Heron's I'm New Here|first=Jude|last= Rogers| author-link = Jude Rogers |date=November 19, 2009|work=The Guardian|access-date=January 22, 2010|location=London}}</ref> while some have called the record "reverent" and "intimate", due to Scott-Heron's half-sung, half-spoken delivery of his poetry. In a music review for public radio network [[NPR]], Will Hermes stated: "Comeback records always worry me, especially when they're made by one of my heroes ... But I was haunted by this record ... He's made a record not without hope but which doesn't come with any easy or comforting answers.

Scott-Heron described himself as a mere participant, in a 2010 interview with ''[[The New Yorker]]'':

<blockquote>
This is Richard's CD. My only knowledge when I got to the studio was how he seemed to have wanted this for a long time. You're in a position to have somebody do something that they really want to do, and it was not something that would hurt me or damage me—why not? All the dreams you show up in are not your own.<ref name="newyorker"/></blockquote>

<blockquote>
''The Last Holiday'' is as much about his life as it is about context, the theater of late 20th century America — from Jim Crow to the Reagan '80s and from Beale Street to 57th Street. The narrative is not, however, a rise-and-fall retelling of Scott-Heron's life and career. It doesn't connect all the dots. It moves off-the-beat, at its own speed ... This approach to revelation lends the book an episodic quality, like oral storytelling does. It winds around, it repeats itself.<ref>{{cite news|title=Book review: 'The Last Holiday: A Memoir' by Gil Scott-Heron|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2012/jan/29/entertainment/la-ca-gil-scott-heron-20120129|access-date=March 25, 2014|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=January 29, 2012|first=Lynette|last= George}}</ref></blockquote>

===Scott-Heron's estate===
At the time of Scott-Heron's death, a will could not be found to determine the future of his estate. Additionally, Raquiyah Kelly-Heron filed papers in Manhattan, New York's Surrogate's Court in August 2013, claiming that Rumal Rackley is not Scott-Heron's son and should therefore be omitted from matters concerning the musician's estate.
According to the ''Daily News'' website, Rackley, Kelly-Heron and two other sisters have been seeking a resolution to the issue of the management of Scott-Heron's estate, as Rackley stated in court papers that Scott-Heron prepared him to be the eventual administrator of the estate. 
Scott-Heron's 1994 album ''Spirits'' was dedicated to "my son Rumal and my daughters Nia and Gia", and in court papers Rackley added that Scott-Heron "introduced me [Rackley] from the stage as his son".<ref name="Greg">{{cite web|title= Gil Scott-Heron's daughter tries to get half-brother excluded from poet's estate|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/gil-scott-heron-daughter-exclude-half-brother-estate-article-1.1423606|work=NY Daily News|access-date=March 25, 2014|first=Dareh|last= Gregorian|date=August 11, 2013}}</ref>

In 2011, Rackley filed a suit against sister Gia Scott-Heron and her mother, Scott-Heron's first wife, Brenda Sykes, as he believed they had unfairly attained US$250,000 of Scott-Heron's money. The case was later settled for an undisclosed sum in early 2013; but the relationship between Rackley and Scott-Heron's two adult daughters already had become strained in the months after Gil's death. 
In her submission to the Surrogate's Court, Kelly-Heron states that a DNA test completed by Rackley in 2011—using DNA from Scott-Heron's brother—revealed that they "do not share a common male lineage", while Rackley has refused to undertake another DNA test since that time. A hearing to address Kelly-Heron's filing was scheduled for late August 2013, but by March 2016 further information on the matter was not publicly available.<ref name="Greg" /> Rackley still serves as court-appointed administrator for the estate, and donated material to the Smithsonian's new National Museum of African American History and Culture for Scott-Heron to be included among the exhibits and displays when the museum opened in September 2016. In December 2018, the Surrogate Court ruled that Rumal Rackley and his half sisters are all legal heirs.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}

==Influence and legacy==
Scott-Heron's work has influenced writers, academics and musicians, from [[indie rock]]ers to rappers. His work during the 1970s influenced and helped engender subsequent African-American music genres, such as [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[neo soul]]. He has been described by music writers as "the godfather of rap" and "the black Bob Dylan".<ref name="O'Hagan"/>

''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' writer [[Greg Kot]] comments on Scott-Heron's collaborative work with Jackson:

<blockquote>
Together they crafted jazz-influenced soul and funk that brought new depth and political consciousness to '70s music alongside [[Marvin Gaye]] and [[Stevie Wonder]]. In classic albums such as {{'}}''Winter in America''{{'}} and {{'}}''From South Africa to South Carolina'',{{'}} Scott-Heron took the news of the day and transformed it into social commentary, wicked satire, and proto-rap anthems. He updated his dispatches from the front lines of the inner city on tour, improvising lyrics with an improvisational daring that matched the jazz-soul swirl of the music".<ref name="KotG"/></blockquote>

Of Scott-Heron's influence on hip hop, Kot writes that he "presag[ed] hip-hop and infus[ed] soul and jazz with poetry, humor and pointed political commentary".<ref name="KotG"/> [[Ben Sisario]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' writes that "He [Scott-Heron] preferred to call himself a "bluesologist", drawing on the traditions of blues, jazz and Harlem renaissance poetics".<ref name="nyt-obit" /> [[Tris McCall]] of ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'' writes that "The arrangements on Gil Scott-Heron's early recordings were consistent with the conventions of jazz poetry – the movement that sought to bring the spontaneity of live performance to the reading of verse".<ref name="McCall">[[Tris McCall|McCall, Tris]] (May 28, 2011).

<blockquote>
Together throughout the 1970s, Scott-Heron and Jackson made music that reflected the turbulence, uncertainty and increasing pessimism of the times, merging the soul and jazz traditions and drawing on an [[oral poetry]] tradition that reached back to the blues and forward to hip-hop. The music sounded by turns angry, defiant and regretful while Scott-Heron's lyrics possessed a satirical edge that set them apart from the militant soul of contemporaries such as [[Marvin Gaye]] and [[Curtis Mayfield]].<ref name="O'Hagan">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/feb/07/gil-scott-heron-comeback-interview |title=Gil Scott-Heron: The Godfather of Rap Comes Back|first=Sean|last=O'Hagan|newspaper=The Observer|date= February 7, 2010|access-date= February 11, 2010}}</ref></blockquote>

Will Layman of [[PopMatters]] wrote about the significance of Scott-Heron's early musical work:

<blockquote>
In the early 1970s, Gil Scott-Heron popped onto the scene as a soul poet with jazz leanings; not just another [[Bill Withers]], but a political voice with a poet's skill. His spoken-voice work had punch and topicality. "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" and "Johannesburg" were calls to action: [[Stokely Carmichael]] if he'd had the groove of [[Ray Charles]]. '[[The Bottle]]' was a poignant story of the streets: [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]] as sung by a husky-voiced Marvin Gaye. To paraphrase [[Chuck D]], Gil Scott-Heron's music was a kind of [[CNN]] for black neighborhoods, prefiguring hip-hop by several years. It grew from [[the Last Poets]], but it also had the funky swing of [[Horace Silver]] or [[Herbie Hancock]]—or [[Otis Redding]]. ''Pieces of a Man'' and ''Winter in America'' (collaborations with Brian Jackson) were classics beyond category".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/120263-gil-scott-heron-im-new-here |title=Gil Scott-Heron: I'm New Here |website=PopMatters|last=Layman|first= Will|date=February 11, 2010|access-date= June 9, 2011}}</ref></blockquote>

Scott-Heron's influence over hip hop is primarily exemplified by his definitive single "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised", sentiments from which have been explored by various rappers, including [[Aesop Rock]], [[Talib Kweli]] and [[Common (rapper)|Common]]. In addition to his vocal style, Scott-Heron's indirect contributions to rap music extend to his and co-producer Jackson's compositions, which have been sampled by various hip-hop artists. "We Almost Lost Detroit" was sampled by [[Brand Nubian]] member [[Grand Puba]] ("Keep On"), [[Native Tongues]] duo [[Black Star (group)|Black Star]] ("Brown Skin Lady"), and [[MF Doom]] ("Camphor").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://samplesvshiphop.com/category/artistvshh/gil-scott-heron-and-brian-jackson-vs-hip-hop |title=Gil Scott-Heron and Brian Jackson vs Hip Hop |publisher=Samples VS.

Scott-Heron admitted ambivalence regarding his association with rap, remarking in 2010 in an interview for the ''Daily Swarm'': "I don't know if I can take the blame for [rap music]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailyswarm.com/swarm/daily-swarm-interview-gil-scott-heron-revolution-will-not-be-blogged|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313092403/http://www.thedailyswarm.com/swarm/daily-swarm-interview-gil-scott-heron-revolution-will-not-be-blogged/|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 13, 2010|title=The Daily Swarm Interview: Gil Scott-Heron – The Revolution Will Not Be Blogged|last=Gensler|first=Andy|date=March 10, 2010|work=The Daily Swarm|access-date=January 26, 2014}}</ref> As ''New York Times'' writer Sisario explained, he preferred the moniker of "bluesologist". Referring to reviews of his last album and references to him as the "godfather of rap", Scott-Heron said: "It's something that's aimed at the kids ... I have kids, so I listen to it. But I would not say it's aimed at me. I listen to the jazz station."<ref name="nyt-obit" /> In 2013, Chattanooga rapper [[Isaiah Rashad]] recorded an unofficial mixtape called Pieces of a Kid, which was greatly influenced by Heron's debut album Pieces of a Man.

Following Scott-Heron's funeral in 2011, a tribute from publisher, record company owner, poet, and music producer [[Malik Al Nasir]] was published on ''The Guardian''{{'}}s website, titled "Gil Scott-Heron saved my life".<ref name=Nasir />

In the 2018 film ''[[First Man (film)|First Man]]'', Scott-Heron is a minor character and is played by [[soul music|soul]] singer [[Leon Bridges]].

He is one of eight significant people shown in mosaic at the 167th Street renovated subway station on the Grand Concourse in the Bronx that reopened in 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://welcome2thebronx.com/2019/01/11/watch-newly-renovated-subway-station-celebrates-famous-people-with-bronx-ties-including-sonia-sotomayor-gil-scott-heron/|title=WATCH: Newly Renovated Subway Station Celebrates Famous People With Bronx Ties Including Sonia Sotomayor, & Gil Scott-Heron|publisher=welcome2thebronx.com|access-date=January 19, 2019}}</ref>
