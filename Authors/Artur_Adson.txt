==Early years==
Artur Adson (born Karl Arthur Adson) was born in [[Tartu]] and attended school in Tartu, [[Sänna]] and [[Võru]]. After graduating he first studied [[surveying]] in [[Pskov]]. In 1925-26, he studied literature at the [[University of Tartu]]. Artur Adson was a surveyor, journalist and theater critic in Estonia and Russia. He met his future wife [[Marie Under]] in 1913  and were married in 1927.

==Literary career==
From 1917 Artur Adson was a member of the [[Siuru]] literary movement, which exerted great influence on the Estonian literature. Later Adson was also active in the [[Tarapita]] movement. In addition, Adson was one of the most outstanding poets in the [[Võro language]] of southern Estonia. As an often conservative theatrical and literary critic, he exercised influence on the cultural scene of the Republic of Estonia.
