'''Raees Warsi''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|  رئیس  وارثی }}}}; born 1 March 1963) is a Pakistani American [[Urdu]] [[poet]], [[journalist]], [[lyricist]], [[TV anchor]] and [[social worker]]. He has blended contemporary issues into classic rhyme. Where [[Urdu poetry]] was confined to the issues of love, romance and its tragedies till the early 20th century, Warsi and some other notable contemporary poetry have expanded Urdu poetry to the demands of modern realism while still maintaining the classic rhyme. He currently resides in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://muslimvoicesfestival.org/artist/artists-chaikhana |title=http://muslimvoicesfestival.org/artist/artists-chaikhana |publisher=Muslimvoicesfestival.org}}</ref>
