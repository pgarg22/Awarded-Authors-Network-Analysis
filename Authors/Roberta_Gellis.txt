==Biography==

Roberta was born on September 27, 1927, in Brooklyn, New York City, the daughter of Dr. Morris B. Jacobs and Margaret (Segall) Jacobs. She graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School in Brooklyn, NY. She received a B.S. in Chemistry from Hunter College of the City University of New York in 1947 and an M.S. in Biochemistry from Brooklyn Polytechnic University in 1952. She worked both as a freelance scientific copy editor and as a research chemist for Foster D. Snell for many years, where she and her inventing partner developed aerosolized shaving foam and pink hair dye, among other creations, before she entered a second career as a best-selling author.

Starting with Knight's Honor in 1964, Roberta was the author of nearly fifty novels. These included more than twenty historical romances, including the Roselynde Chronicles and the Heiress Series, a number of medieval murder mysteries, and several historical fantasies. Other novels ranged from space opera to gothic romance to a mystery featuring the much-maligned Lucrezia Borgia as an amateur detective. She mostly wrote under her own name, but occasionally wrote as Max Daniels, Leah Jacobs, and Priscilla Hamilton. She won numerous awards for her writing, including a 1983 award from Romantic Times for Best Historical Series and a 1996 Lifetime Achievement Award from the Romance Writers of America.

She married her high school sweetheart Charles Gellis on April 14, 1946, in Brooklyn, NY. They had one son, Mark Gellis. Roberta and Charles were married for 68 years. He preceded her in death on November 17, 2014. They resided for many years in Roslyn Heights, New York, before moving to Lafayette, Indiana, and then to Flushing, Michigan.

Roberta loved animals and was an enthusiastic supporter of animal rescue and animal charities. She had several canine companions during her lifetime, including Airedales, Welsh Terriers, Lakeland Terriers, Scottish Terriers, and West Highland Terriers.

She died on May 6, 2016, in Michigan and is buried at Great Lakes National Cemetery in Holly, MI.
