'''Eva Maria Charlotte Michelle Ibbotson''' (née '''Wiesner'''; born 21 January 1925 – 20 October 2010)<ref name=guardian/> was a British novelist born in Austria to a [[Jewish]] family who fled the [[Nazis]]. She is known for her [[children's literature]]. Some of her novels for adults have been reissued for the [[young adult fiction|young adult]] market. The historical novel ''Journey to the River Sea'' (Macmillan, 2001) won her the [[Smarties Prize]] in category 9–11 years, garnered an unusual commendation as runner-up for the [[Guardian Prize]],<ref name=fine/> and made the Carnegie, Whitbread, and Blue Peter shortlists. She was a finalist for the 2010 Guardian Prize at the time of her death.<ref name=shortlist2010/> Her last book, ''The Abominables'', was among four finalists for the same award in 2012.<ref name=shortlist2012/><ref name=longlist2012/>

==Personal life==
Wiesner was born in [[Vienna]] in 1925 to non-practising [[Jewish]] parents.<ref name=eccleshare/> Her father, [[Bertold Wiesner|Bertold Paul Wiesner]], was a physician who pioneered human infertility treatment. He is now believed to have used his own [[sperm]] to sire perhaps 600 of the children his clinic helped to be born.<ref name=fricker/> Her mother, [[Anna Gmeyner|Anna Wilhelmine Gmeyner]], was a successful novelist and playwright, who had worked with [[Bertolt Brecht]] and written film scripts for [[G. W. Pabst|Georg Pabst]].<ref name=tucker/>

Wiesner's parents separated in 1928 when she was three years old. What followed for Eva was, in her words, a "very cosmopolitan, sophisticated and quite interesting, but also very unhappy childhood, always on some train and wishing to have a home," as she later recalled.<ref name=pauli/> Her father took up a university lectureship in [[Edinburgh]], while her mother left Vienna for [[Paris]] in 1933 after her work was banned by [[Adolf Hitler]], putting a sudden end to her successful writing career.

In 1934, her mother moved to England, settling in [[Belsize Park]], north London, and sent for her daughter. Other family members also escaped from Vienna and joined Anna and Eva Maria in England, avoiding the worst of the [[Nazi German|Nazi regime]], which had already affected the family. The experience of fleeing Vienna was a strong thread throughout Ibbotson's life and work.<ref name=davies/>

Wiesner attended [[Dartington Hall School]], which she later fictionalised as Delderton Hall in her novel ''[[The Dragonfly Pool]]'' (2008). Originally, she intended to become a physiologist like her father, and earned an undergraduate degree from Bedford College, London, in 1945. During her postgraduate studies at [[Cambridge University]], she met her future husband, Alan Ibbotson, an [[Ecology|ecologist]].<ref name=telegraph/>

==Marriage and family==
Eva married Alan Ibbotson in 1947.<ref name=telegraph/> They moved to [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne]] where they raised their family of three sons and a daughter.

Finding the thought of having to make a career out of conducting experiments on animals appalling, she decided to discontinue her pursuit of scientific research.<ref name=telegraph/> She returned to college, graduating with a diploma in education in 1965 from the [[University of Durham]]. She briefly became a teacher in the 1960s before embarking on her writing career.<ref name=jrank/>

Ibbotson's husband died in 1998. Being "too sad to write in her usual humorous style", she then wrote her ecological classic ''[[Journey to the River Sea]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/24/eva-ibbotson-obituary|title = Eva Ibbotson obituary|date = 24 October 2010}}</ref> She died at her home in Newcastle on 20 October 2010, having just edited the proofs of her last children's book, ''One Dog and his Boy'', and started work on another children's ghost story to add to her long and successful series.

Through her father, Ibbotson was half-sister of the writer [[Paul Newham]] and the Canadian filmmaker [[Barry Stevens (filmmaker)|Barry Stevens]], but never met them.

==Career==
{{More citations needed section|date=July 2012}}
<!-- See TALK #Status report. BFI covers the drama in abstraction from her career; at ISFDB and FantasticFiction the novel is merely the earliest listing within genre(?) -->
Eva Ibbotson began writing with the television drama ''Linda Came Today'', which the British "Television Playhouse" series broadcast in December 1962.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090213095921/http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/263555?view=transmission "Linda Came Today"], ''Film & TV Database: Television Playhouse'', [[British Film Institute]]. Retrieved 26 October 2010.</ref> Her first English-language book was ''The Great Ghost Rescue'', a juvenile fantasy novel<ref name=isfdb/> published in 1975 by Macmillan in the UK and Walck in the US, with illustrations by Simon Stern and Giulio Maestro respectively.<ref name=worldcat/><!-- presum. originated in Britain; fantasticfiction lists US three months prior -->

===Children's books===
Ibbotson wrote more than a dozen books for children,<!-- ages 6 to 11, say? --> including ''[[Which Witch? (novel)|Which Witch?]]'', ''[[The Secret of Platform 13]]'', ''[[Dial-a-Ghost]]'', ''[[Monster Mission]]'', ''[[Journey to the River Sea]]'', ''[[The Star of Kazan]]'', ''[[The Beasts of Clawstone Castle]]'', and ''[[The Dragonfly Pool]]''. She won the [[Nestlé Smarties Book Prize]] for ''Journey to the River Sea'', and has been a runner up for major awards in British children's literature several times. [[WorldCat]] libraries report holding ''Which Witch?'' and ''Journey to the River Sea'' in more than five and ten languages, respectively.<ref name=worldcat/><!-- details do not match the summary counts at the top page -->

The books are imaginative and humorous, and most of them feature magical creatures and places. Ibbotson has said that she disliked thinking about the supernatural, and created the characters because she wanted to decrease her readers' fear of such things. Some of the books, particularly ''Journey to the River Sea'', also reflect Ibbotson's love of nature. She wrote ''Journey'' in honour of her husband, a former naturalist who had just died; the book had been in her head for years. Ibbotson had said she disliked "financial greed and a lust for power", and often created antagonists in her books who have these characteristics.

Her love of Austria is evident in works such as ''The Star of Kazan'', ''A Song for Summer'' and ''Magic Flutes/The Reluctant Heiress''. These books, set primarily in the Austrian countryside, display the author's love of nature.

===Adult books===
Ibbotson was also noted for several works of fiction for adults. Several have been reissued successfully for the young-adult market, some under different titles. Ibbotson was surprised by the repackaging, as she believed they were books for adults, but they have been very popular with teenage audiences. Three are ''The Secret Countess'' (originally published as ''A Countess Below Stairs''), ''A Company of Swans'', and ''Magic Flutes'' (in some editions published as ''The Reluctant Heiress'')

Ibbotson's writing for adults and teens took a new direction in 1992, when she began to move toward romantic novels that dealt with the harsh realities of war and prejudice. Two of her acclaimed books are set in Europe at the time of World War II and reflect her experience of the time. The first of this setting, ''[[The Morning Gift]]'' (1993), became a best-seller. Her last novel for adults was ''[[A Song for Summer]]'' (1997), also set during World War II.

==''The Secret of Platform 13'' and ''Harry Potter''==
{{see also |Harry Potter influences and analogues}} <!-- prefer section #Analogues -->
Critics have found similarities between Ibbotson's "Platform 13" in ''The Secret of Platform 13'' (1994) and [[J.K. Rowling]]'s "[[Platform 9 3/4]]" in the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' books (from 1997), both set in [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross station]] in London. The journalist [[Amanda Craig]] has discussed the similarities: "Ibbotson would seem to have at least as good a case for claiming [[plagiarism]] as the American author currently suing J. K. Rowling but unlike her, Ibbotson says she would 'like to shake her (Rowling) by the hand. I think we all borrow from each other as writers.'"<ref name=craig/>
