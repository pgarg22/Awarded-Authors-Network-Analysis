== Biography ==
[[File:Vasko Popa.JPG|thumb|right|228px|{{center|''Васко Попа''}}]]

Popa was born in the village of [[Grebenac]] ({{lang-ro|Grebenaţ}}), [[Vojvodina]], [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] (present-day [[Serbia]]). After finishing high school, he enrolled as a student at the [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy]]. He continued his studies at the [[University of Bucharest]] and in [[Vienna]]. During [[World War II]], he fought as a [[Yugoslav Partisans|partisan]] and was imprisoned in a German concentration camp in [[Bečkerek]] (today [[Zrenjanin]], [[Serbia]]).

After the war in 1949, Popa graduated from the Romanic group of the Faculty of Philosophy at Belgrade University. He published his first poems in the magazines ''Književne novine'' (''Literary Magazine'') and the daily ''[[Borba (newspaper)|Borba]]'' (''Struggle'').

From 1954 until 1979, he was the editor of the publishing house ''[[Nolit]]''. In 1953 he published his first major verse collection, ''Kora'' (Bark). His other important work included ''Nepočin-polje'' (''No-Rest Field'', 1956), ''Sporedno nebo'' (''Secondary Heaven'', 1968), ''Uspravna zemlja'' (Earth Erect, 1972), ''Vučja so'' (''Wolf Salt'', 1975), and ''Od zlata jabuka'' (''Apple of Gold'', 1978), an anthology of Serbian folk literature. His ''Collected Poems'', 1943–1976, a compilation in English translation, appeared in 1978, with an introduction by the British poet [[Ted Hughes]].

On May 29, 1972, Vasko Popa founded The Literary Municipality Vršac and originated a library of postcards, called Slobodno lišće (Free Leaves). In the same year, he was elected to become a member of the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]].

Vasko Popa was one of the founders of [[Vojvodina Academy of Sciences and Arts]], established on December 14, 1979 in [[Novi Sad]].<ref>[http://www.poemhunter.com/vasko-popa/biography/ Poem Hunter: Biography of Vasko Popa]</ref> He is the first laureate of the Branko’s award (Brankova nagrada) for poetry, established in honour of the poet [[Branko Radičević]]. In the year 1957 Popa received another award for poetry, Zmaj’s Award (Zmajeva nagrada), which honours the poet [[Jovan Jovanović Zmaj]]. In 1965 Popa received the [[Austrian State Prize for European Literature|Austrian state award for European literature]]. In 1976, he received the [[Branko Miljković]] poetry award, in 1978 the Yugoslav state [[Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia]] Award, and in 1983 the literary award [[Skender Kulenović]].

In 1995, the town of [[Vršac]] established a poetry award named after Vasko Popa. It was awarded annually for the best book of poetry published in [[Serbian language|Serbian]]. The award ceremony is held on the day of Popa’s birthday, 29 June.

Vasko Popa died on January 5, 1991 in [[Belgrade]] and is buried in the Aisle of the Deserving Citizens in Belgrade’s [[Novo groblje|New Cemetery]]. He was a good friend with French poet [[Alain Bosquet]].

== Style ==
Vasko Popa wrote in a succinct [[modernist]] style that owed much to [[surrealism]] and [[Serbia]]n folk traditions (via the influence of Serbian poet [[Momčilo Nastasijević]]) and absolutely nothing to the [[Socialist Realism]] that dominated Eastern European literature after [[World War II]]; in fact, he was the first in post-World War II Yugoslavia to break with the Socialist Realism. He created a unique poetic language, mostly elliptical, that combines a modern form, often expressed through colloquial speech and common idioms and phrases, with old, oral folk traditions of Serbia – epic and lyric poems, stories, myths, riddles, etc. In his work, earthly and legendary motifs mix, myths come to surface from the collective subconscious, the inheritance and everyday are in constant interplay, and the abstract is reflected in the specific and concrete, forming a unique and extraordinary poetic dialectics.

In [[The New York Times]] obituary, the author mentions that the English poet Ted Hughes lauded Popa as an "epic poet" with a "vast vision". Hughes states in his introduction to ''Vasko Popa: Collected Poems 1943-1976'', translated by Anne Pennington, "As Popa penetrates deeper into his life, with book after book, it begins to look like a universe passing through a universe. It is one of the most exciting things in modern poetry, to watch this journey being made.".<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/09/obituaries/vasko-popa-68-poet-examining-life-with-humor.html New York Times Obituaries, January 9, 1991]</ref>

Mexican poet and Nobel laureate [[Octavio Paz]] said, "Poets have the gift to speak for others, Vasko Popa had the very rare quality of hearing the others."

Popa's ''Collected Poems'' translation by Anne Pennington with its introduction by Hughes is part of "The Persea Series of Poetry in Translation," general editor Daniel Weissbort. Premiere literary critic John Bayley of Oxford University reviewed the book in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' and wrote that Popa was "one of the best European poets writing today."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1979/11/08/life-studies/|title=Life Studies|last=Bayley|first=John|journal=New York Review of Books|date=1979-11-08|access-date=2019-08-13|language=en|issn=0028-7504}} {{verify source |date=September 2019 |reason=This ref was deleted Special:Diff/911316169 by a bug in VisualEditor and later restored by a bot from the original cite located at Special:Permalink/911315504 cite #3 - verify the cite is accurate and delete this template.
