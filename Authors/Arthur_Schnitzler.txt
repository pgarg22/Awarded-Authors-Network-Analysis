'''Arthur Schnitzler''' (15 May 1862 – 21 October 1931) was an [[Austrian literature|Austrian author]] and dramatist.

== Biography ==
[[File:Schnitzler-birthplace Praterstrasse1.JPG|thumb|Schnitzler's birthplace Praterstrasse 16]]

Arthur Schnitzler was born at Praterstrasse 16, [[Leopoldstadt]], Vienna, capital of the [[Austrian Empire]] (as of 1867, part of the dual monarchy of [[Austria-Hungary]]). He was the son of a prominent Hungarian [[laryngologist]], [[Johann Schnitzler]] (1835–1893), and Luise Markbreiter (1838–1911), a daughter of the Viennese doctor Philipp Markbreiter. His parents were both from Jewish families.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Road-Open-Verite-European-Classics-ebook/dp/B00KUFP4QU/|title=The Road to The Open (JC Verite European Classics Book 1) – Kindle edition by Arthur Schnitzler, J. Chakravarti, Horace Samuel. Literature & Fiction Kindle eBooks @ Amazon.com.|work=amazon.com}}</ref> In 1879 Schnitzler began studying medicine at the [[University of Vienna]] and in 1885 he received his doctorate of medicine. He began work at [[Vienna General Hospital|Vienna's General Hospital]] ({{lang-de|link=no|Allgemeines Krankenhaus der Stadt Wien}}), but ultimately abandoned the practice of medicine in favour of writing.

On 26 August 1903, Schnitzler married Olga Gussmann (1882–1970), a 21-year-old aspiring actress and singer who came from a Jewish middle-class family. They had a son, [[Heinrich Schnitzler|Heinrich]] (1902–1982), born on 9 August 1902. In 1909 they had a daughter, Lili, who committed suicide in 1928. The Schnitzlers separated in 1921. Schnitzler died on 21 October 1931 in Vienna of a brain hemorrhage. In 1938, following the [[Anschluss]], his son Heinrich went to the United States and did not return to Austria until 1959; he is the father of the Austrian musician and conservationist [[Michael Schnitzler]], born in 1944 in Berkeley, California, who moved to Vienna with his parents in 1959.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.regenwald.at/de/project-information/who-is-michael-schnitzler.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-01-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220033139/http://www.regenwald.at/de/project-information/who-is-michael-schnitzler.html |archive-date=20 February 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref>

==Literary works==
Schnitzler's works were often controversial, both for their frank description of sexuality (in a letter to Schnitzler [[Sigmund Freud]] confessed "I have gained the impression that you have learned through intuition – although actually as a result of sensitive introspection – everything that I have had to unearth by laborious work on other persons")<ref>[http://www.research-horizons.cam.ac.uk/features/schnitzler-s-hidden-manuscripts-explored.aspx Schnitzler's hidden manuscripts explored] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315122800/http://www.research-horizons.cam.ac.uk/features/schnitzler-s-hidden-manuscripts-explored.aspx |date=15 March 2010 }} at research-horizons.cam.ac.uk</ref> and for their strong stand against [[anti-semitism]], represented by works such as his play ''[[Professor Bernhardi]]'' and his novel ''[[Der Weg ins Freie]]''. However, although Schnitzler was Jewish, Professor Bernhardi and Fräulein Else are among the few clearly identified Jewish protagonists in his work.

Schnitzler was branded as a pornographer after the release of his play ''[[La Ronde (play)|Reigen]]'', in which 10 pairs of characters are shown before and after the sexual act, leading and ending with a prostitute. The furor after this play was couched in the strongest anti-semitic terms.<ref>[http://www.virtualvienna.net/columns/vinal/arthur_schnitzler_scandal.html Arthur Schnitzler scandal] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070128074046/http://www.virtualvienna.net/columns/vinal/arthur_schnitzler_scandal.html |date=28 January 2007 }} at virtualvienna.net</ref> ''Reigen'' was made into a French language film in 1950 by the German-born director [[Max Ophüls]] as ''[[La Ronde (1950 film)|La Ronde]]''. The film achieved considerable success in the English-speaking world, with the result that Schnitzler's play is better known there under its French title. [[Richard Oswald]]'s film ''[[The Merry-Go-Round (film)|The Merry-Go-Round]]'' (1920), [[Roger Vadim]]'s ''[[Circle of Love (film)|Circle of Love]]'' (1964) and Otto Schenk's ''Der Reigen'' (1973) also are based on the play. More recently, in [[Fernando Meirelles]]' film ''[[360 (film)|360]]'', Schnitzler's play was provided with a new version as has been the case with many other TV and film productions.

In the novella ''[[Fräulein Else (novella)|Fräulein Else]]'' (1924) Schnitzler may be rebutting a contentious critique of the Jewish character by [[Otto Weininger]] (1903) by positioning the sexuality of the young female Jewish protagonist.<ref>Barker, Andrew (2001). "Race, Sex and Character in Schnitzler's ''Fräulein Else''." ''German Life and Letters''. v. 54(1):1–9.</ref> The story, a first-person [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] narrative by a young aristocratic woman, reveals a moral dilemma that ends in tragedy.

In response to an interviewer who asked Schnitzler what he thought about the critical view that his works all seemed to treat the same subjects, he replied "I write of love and death. What other subjects are there?"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Vienna : a cultural history|last=Nicholas.|first=Parsons|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195376067|location=Oxford|oclc=221155367}}</ref> Despite his seriousness of purpose, Schnitzler frequently approaches the [[bedroom farce]] in his plays (and had an affair with  [[Adele Sandrock]], one of his actresses). ''Professor Bernhardi'', a play about a Jewish doctor who turns away a Catholic priest in order to spare a patient the realization that she is on the point of death, is his only major dramatic work without a sexual theme.

A member of the avant-garde group [[Young Vienna]] (''Jung-Wien''), Schnitzler toyed with formal as well as social conventions. With his 1900 novella ''Leutnant Gustl'', he was the first to write German fiction in stream-of-consciousness narration. The story is an unflattering portrait of its protagonist and of the army's obsessive code of formal honor. It caused Schnitzler to be stripped of his commission as a reserve officer in the medical corps – something that should be seen against the rising tide of anti-semitism of the time.

He specialized in shorter works like novellas and one-act plays. And in his short stories like "The Green Tie" ("Die grüne Krawatte") he showed himself to be one of the early masters of [[microfiction]]. However he also wrote two full-length novels: ''[[Der Weg ins Freie]]'' about a talented but not very motivated young composer, a brilliant description of a segment of pre-World War I Viennese society; and the artistically less satisfactory ''[[Therese (novel)|Therese]]''.

In addition to his plays and fiction, Schnitzler meticulously kept a diary from the age of 17 until two days before his death. The manuscript, which runs to almost 8,000 pages, is most notable for Schnitzler's casual descriptions of sexual conquests; he was often in relationships with several women at once, and for a period of some years he kept a record of every orgasm. Collections of Schnitzler's letters also have been published.

Schnitzler's works were called "Jewish filth" by [[Adolf Hitler]] and were banned by [[Nazism|the Nazis]] in Austria and Germany. In 1933, when [[Joseph Goebbels]] organized [[Nazi book burnings|book burnings]] in Berlin and other cities, Schnitzler's works were thrown into flames along with those of other Jews, including [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]], [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] and [[Stefan Zweig]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/schnitz.htm |title=Arthur Schnitzler |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206131904/http://kirjasto.sci.fi/schnitz.htm |archive-date=6 February 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

His novella ''[[Fräulein Else (novella)|Fräulein Else]]'' has been adapted a number of times, including the German silent film ''[[Fräulein Else (1929 film)|Fräulein Else]]'' (1929), starring [[Elisabeth Bergner]], and the 1946 Argentine film ''[[The Naked Angel]]'', starring [[Olga Zubarry]].
