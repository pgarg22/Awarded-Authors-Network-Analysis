==Biography==
Growing up in [[Southern California]], Uyematsu was torn between the [[Culture of Japan|Japanese culture]] of her family and the [[Culture of the United States|American culture]] of her environment, a conflict which has deeply influenced her writing and [[poetry]]. She penned the essay 'The Emergence of Yellow Power' in 1969 (for the Japanese-American journal ''Gidra''), an assertion of [[Asian-American]] identity influenced by the consciousness-raising theories of [[Black Power]].<ref>{{cite book |title= Roots: An Asian American Reader|editor1-first= Amy|editor1-last= Tachiki|editor2-first= Eddie|editor2-last= Wong|editor3-first= Franklin|editor3-last= Odo|year= 1971|publisher= University of California, Los Angeles Press}}</ref> Uyematsu has published four poetry books.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/bic1/MagazinesDetailsPage/MagazinesDetailsWindow?failOverType=&query=&prodId=BIC1&windowstate=normal&contentModules=&display-query=&mode=view&displayGroupName=Magazines&limiter=&u=dclib_main&currPage=&disableHighlighting=false&displayGroups=&sortBy=&source=&search_within_results=&p=BIC1&action=e&catId=&activityType=&scanId=&documentId=GALE%7CA132843375|title = Uyematsu, Amy.
