Often compared to [[Saul Bellow]] and [[Theodore Dreiser]] for his unique portrayal of setting and landscapes, Dybek is "among the first writers of Polish descent (who write about the ethnic self) to receive national recognition."<ref>Gladsky, Thomas S.

After teaching for more than 30 years at [[Western Michigan University]], where he remains an Adjunct Professor of English and a member of the permanent faculty of the Prague Summer Program, Dybek became the Distinguished Writer in Residence at [[Northwestern University]] where he teaches at the [[Northwestern University School of Professional Studies|School of Professional Studies]].

His work has been anthologized and has appeared in magazines such as ''[[Harper's]]'', ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'', ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'', ''[[Tin House]]'', ''[[Ploughshares]]'', and ''Triquarterly''.

His collection, ''The Coast of Chicago'', was selected as a [[New York Times Notable Book]] and cited as an [[American Library Association Notable Book]] of 2005. A story from ''I Sailed With Magellan'',  titled "Breasts," appears in the 2004 ''[[Best American Short Stories]]''.
