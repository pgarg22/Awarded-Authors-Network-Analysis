'''Elizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell''' (''née'' '''Stevenson'''; 29 September 1810 – 12 November 1865), often referred to as '''Mrs Gaskell''', was an English novelist, biographer and short story writer. Her novels offer a detailed portrait of the lives of many strata of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] society, including the very poor. Her work is of interest to [[social history|social historians]] as well as readers of literature. Her first novel, ''[[Mary Barton]]'', was published in 1848. Gaskell's ''[[The Life of Charlotte Brontë]]'', published in 1857, was the first biography of [[Charlotte Brontë]]. In this biography, she wrote only of the moral, sophisticated things in Brontë's life; the rest she left out, deciding that certain, more salacious aspects were better kept hidden. Among Gaskell's best known novels are ''[[Cranford (novel)|Cranford]]'' (1851–53), ''[[North and South (Gaskell novel)|North and South]]'' (1854–55), and ''[[Wives and Daughters]]'' (1865), each having been adapted for television by the BBC.

==Early life==
Gaskell was born Elizabeth Cleghorn Stevenson on 29 September 1810 in Lindsey Row, [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], London, at the house that is now 93 [[Cheyne Walk]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gaskellsociety.co.uk/elizabeth-gaskell/|title=Elizabeth Gaskell Biography - The Gaskell Society|website=Gaskellsociety.co.uk|access-date=9 December 2017}}</ref> The doctor who delivered her was [[Anthony Todd Thomson|Dr Anthony Todd Thomson]], and Thomson's sister Catherine later became Gaskell's stepmother.<ref>{{Cite ODNB |last=Uglow |first=Jenny |authorlink=Jenny Uglow |title=Gaskell [née Stevenson], Elizabeth Cleghorn |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/10434}}</ref> She was the youngest of eight children; only she and her brother John survived infancy. Her father, [[William Stevenson (Scottish writer)|William Stevenson]], a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] from Berwick-upon-Tweed, was minister at [[Failsworth]], Lancashire, but resigned his orders on conscientious grounds; he moved to London in 1806 with the intention of going to [[India]] after he was appointed private secretary to the [[Earl of Lauderdale]], who was to become [[Governor General of India]].  That position did not materialise, however, and instead, Stevenson was nominated Keeper of the Treasury Records.

His wife, Elizabeth Holland, came from a family established in Lancashire and Cheshire that was connected with other prominent Unitarian families, including the [[Wedgwood]]s, the [[Martineau family|Martineaus]], the [[William Turner (Unitarian minister)|Turners]] and the [[Darwin–Wedgwood family|Darwins]]. When she died 13&nbsp;months after giving birth to her youngest daughter,<ref name="Chronology">{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Companion to Elizabeth Gaskell; Chronology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TjZjIpq6TwoC|last=Weyant |first=Nancy S. |year=2007 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-60926-5 |pages=xi–xx }}<!--|access-date=29 February 2012--></ref> she left a bewildered husband who saw no alternative but to send Elizabeth to live with her mother's sister, Hannah Lumb, in [[Knutsford]], Cheshire.<ref>{{cite book |title=Mrs. Gaskell: Novelist and Biographer |url=https://archive.org/details/mrsgaskellnoveli0000poll |url-access=registration |last=Pollard |first=Arthur |year=1965 |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=0-674-57750-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/mrsgaskellnoveli0000poll/page/12 12] }}</ref> Elizabeth's future while she was growing up was uncertain, as she had no personal wealth and no firm home, though she was a permanent guest at her aunt and grandparents' house.

Her father remarried, to Catherine Thomson, in 1814. They had a son, William, in 1815, and a daughter, Catherine, in 1816. Although Elizabeth spent several years without seeing her father, to whom she was devoted, her older brother John often visited her in Knutsford. John was destined for the [[Royal Navy]] from an early age, like his grandfathers and uncles, but he did not obtain preferment into the Service and had to join the [[British Merchant Navy|Merchant Navy]] with the [[English East India Company|East India Company]]'s fleet.<ref>{{cite book |title=Elizabeth Gaskell |last=Gérin |first=Winifred |year=1976 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-281296-3 |pages=10–17 }}</ref> John went missing in 1827 during an expedition to India.

==Character and influences==
A beautiful young woman, Elizabeth was well-groomed, tidily dressed, kind, gentle, and considerate of others.  Her temperament was calm and collected, joyous and innocent, she revelled in the simplicity of rural life.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Much of Elizabeth's childhood was spent in Cheshire, where she lived with her aunt Hannah Lumb in Knutsford, the town she immortalized as ''[[Cranford (novel)|Cranford]]''. They lived in a large red-brick house called The Heath (now Heathwaite).<ref>{{cite book |author=Jenny Uglow |author-link=Jenny Uglow |title=Elizabeth Gaskell: A Habit of Stories |year=1993 |publisher=Faber & Faber |pages=13–14 |isbn=0-571-20359-0}}</ref><ref>Heathside (now Gaskell Avenue), which faces the large open area of Knutsford Heath.</ref>

From 1821 to 1826 she attended a school in Warwickshire run by the [[Maria Byerley|Misses Byerley]], first at [[Barford, Warwickshire|Barford]] and from 1824 at Avonbank outside [[Stratford-on-Avon (district)|Stratford-on-Avon]],<ref name="Chronology"/> where she received the traditional education in arts, the classics, decorum and propriety given to young ladies from relatively wealthy families at the time. Her aunts gave her the classics to read, and she was encouraged by her father in her studies and writing. Her brother John sent her modern books, and descriptions of his life at sea and his experiences abroad.<ref name="Pocket">{{cite book |title=Introduction to The Manchester Marriage |last=Michell |first=Sheila |year=1985 |publisher=Alan Sutton |location=UK |isbn=0-86299-247-8 |pages=iv–viii }}<!--|access-date=29 February 2012--></ref>

After leaving school at the age of 16, Elizabeth travelled to London to spend time with her Holland cousins.<ref name="Pocket"/> She also spent some time in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] (with the [[William Turner (Unitarian minister)|Rev William Turner]]'s family) and from there made the journey to [[Edinburgh]].  Her stepmother's brother was the [[portrait miniature|miniature artist]] [[William John Thomson]], who in 1832 painted a portrait of Elizabeth Gaskell in Manchester (see top right).  A bust was sculpted by David Dunbar at the same time.<ref name="Pocket"/>

==Married life and writing career==
[[File:Elizabeth Gaskell.jpg|thumb|Elizabeth Gaskell: 1851 portrait by [[George Richmond (painter)|George Richmond]]]]
On 30 August 1832 Elizabeth married [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister [[William Gaskell]], in Knutsford. They spent their honeymoon in [[North Wales]], staying with her uncle, Samuel Holland, at Plas-yn-Penrhyn near [[Porthmadog]].<ref>”The prominent house Plas yn Penrhyn …. at the top of Penrhyn itself was the home of Samuel Holland ...” Gwynedd Archaeological Trust http://www.heneb.co.uk/hlc/ffestiniog/ffest27.html</ref> The Gaskells then settled in Manchester, where William was the minister at [[Cross Street Unitarian Chapel]] and longest-serving Chair of the [[The Portico Library|Portico Library]].  Manchester's industrial surroundings and books borrowed from the library influenced Elizabeth's writing in the [[industrial novel|industrial genre]]. Their first daughter was stillborn in 1833. Their other children were Marianne (1834), Margaret Emily, known as Meta (1837), Florence Elizabeth (1842), and Julia Bradford (1846). Marianne and Meta boarded at the private school conducted by [[Martineau family|Rachel Martineau]], sister of [[Harriet Martineau|Harriet]], a close friend of Elizabeth.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6iNXAAAAYAAJ&q=Manchester+ladies+educational+association+meta+gaskell|title=The Gaskell Society Journal, Volume 22|publisher=The Gaskell Society |year= 2008 |   page =57|access-date=25 April 2017|quote=Meta (Margaret Emily), the second daughter, was sent at about the same age as Marianne to Miss Rachel Martineau, ...}}</ref>  Florence married [[Charles Crompton]], a barrister and Liberal politician, in 1863.<ref name="Chronology"/>

In March 1835 Gaskell began a diary documenting the development of her daughter Marianne: she explored parenthood, the values she placed on her role as a mother; her faith, and, later, relations between Marianne and her sister, Meta.  In 1836 she co-authored with her husband a cycle of poems, ''Sketches among the Poor'', which was published in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' in January 1837. In 1840 [[William Howitt]] published ''Visits to Remarkable Places'' containing a contribution entitled ''Clopton Hall'' by "A Lady", the first work was written and published solely by her.  In April 1840 Howitt published ''The Rural Life of England'', which included a second work titled ''Notes on Cheshire Customs''.<ref name="Chronology"/>

In July 1841 the Gaskells travelled to [[Belgium]] and Germany.  [[German literature]] came to have a strong influence on her short stories, the first of which she published in 1847 as ''Libbie Marsh's Three Eras'', in ''Howitt's Journal'', under the pseudonym "Cotton Mather Mills".  But other influences including [[Adam Smith]]'s ''Social Politics'' enabled a much wider understanding of the cultural milieu in which her works were set.  Her second story printed under the pseudonym was ''The Sexton's Hero''. And she made her last use of it in 1848, with the publication of her story ''Christmas Storms and Sunshine''.

A son, William, (1844–45), died in infancy, and this tragedy was the catalyst for Gaskell's first novel, ''[[Mary Barton]]''. It was ready for publication in October 1848,<ref name="Chronology"/> shortly before they made the move south.  It was an enormous success, selling thousands of copies.  Ritchie called it a "great and remarkable sensation."  It was praised by [[Thomas Carlyle]] and [[Maria Edgeworth]].  She brought the teeming slums of manufacturing in Manchester alive to readers as yet unacquainted with crowded narrow alleyways.  Her obvious depth of feeling was evident, while her turn of phrase and description was described as the greatest since Jane Austen.<ref>Ritchie, p. xviii.</ref>

In 1850 the Gaskells moved to a villa at [[84 Plymouth Grove]].<ref name="Uglow">Uglow J. ''Elizabeth Gaskell: A Habit of Stories'' (Faber and Faber; 1993) ({{ISBN|0-571-20359-0}})</ref> She took her cow with her. For exercise, she would happily walk three miles to help another person in distress.  In Manchester, Elizabeth wrote her remaining literary works, while her husband held welfare committees and tutored the poor in his study. The Gaskells' social circle included writers, journalists, religious dissenters, and social reformers such as William and [[Mary Howitt]] and [[Harriet Martineau]]. Poets, patrons of literature and writers such as  [[Richard Monckton Milnes, 1st Baron Houghton|Lord Houghton]],  [[Charles Dickens]] and [[John Ruskin]] visited Plymouth Grove, as did the American writers [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] and [[Charles Eliot Norton]], while the conductor [[Charles Hallé]], who lived close by, taught piano to one of their daughters. Elizabeth's friend [[Charlotte Brontë]] stayed there three times, and on one occasion hid behind the drawing room curtains as she was too shy to meet the Gaskells' other visitors.<ref name="Independent">{{cite news|url=http://arts.independent.co.uk/books/features/article353793.ece |last=Nurden |first=Robert |title=An ending Dickens would have liked |date=26 March 2006 |location=London |work=The Independent |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930165339/http://arts.independent.co.uk/books/features/article353793.ece |archive-date=30 September 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Miss Meta Gaskell|url=http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/1st-november-1913/24/miss-meta-gaskell|work=The Spectator |date=1 November 1913|access-date=25 April 2017|quote=LORD HOUGHTON once said that the conversation and society to be met within the house of the Gaskells at Manchester were the one thing which made life in that city tolerable for people of literary tastes.

In early 1850 Gaskell wrote to [[Charles Dickens]] asking for advice about assisting a girl named Pasley whom she had visited in prison. Pasley provided her with a model for the title character of ''[[Ruth (novel)|Ruth]]'' in 1853. ''Lizzie Leigh'' was published in March and April 1850, in the first numbers of Dickens's journal ''[[Household Words]]'', in which many of her works were to be published, including ''[[Cranford (novel)|Cranford]]'' and ''[[North and South (Gaskell novel)|North and South]]'', her novella ''[[My Lady Ludlow]]'', and short stories.

In June 1855 [[Patrick Brontë]] asked Gaskell to write a biography of his daughter Charlotte, and ''The Life of Charlotte Brontë'' was published in 1857. This played a significant role in developing Gaskell's own literary career.<ref name="Chronology"/> In the biography, Gaskell chose to focus more on Brontë as a woman than as a writer of Romantic fiction.<ref>Stone, Donald D. ''The Romantic Impulse in Victorian Fiction''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1980, p. 141.</ref> In 1859 Gaskell travelled to [[Whitby]] to gather material for ''[[Sylvia's Lovers]]'', which was published in 1863. Her novella ''Cousin Phyllis'' was serialized in ''[[The Cornhill Magazine]]'' from November 1863 to February 1864. The serialization of her last novel, ''Wives and Daughters'', began in August 1864 in ''The Cornhill''.<ref name="Chronology"/> She died of a heart attack in 1865, while visiting a house she had purchased in [[Holybourne]], Hampshire. ''Wives and Daughters'' was published in book form in early 1866, first in the United States and then, ten days later, in Britain.<ref name="Chronology"/>

==Reputation and re-evaluation==
Gaskell's reputation from her death to the 1950s was epitomized by [[Lord David Cecil]]'s assessment in ''Early Victorian Novelists'' (1934) that she was "all woman" and "makes a creditable effort to overcome her natural deficiencies but all in vain" (quoted in Stoneman, 1987, from Cecil, p.&nbsp;235). A scathing unsigned  [[review]] of ''North and South'' in ''[[The Leader (English newspaper)|The Leader]]'' accused Gaskell of making errors about Lancashire which a resident of Manchester would not make and said that a woman (or clergymen and women) could not "understand industrial problems", would "know too little about the cotton industry" and had no "right to add to the confusion by writing about it".<ref>{{cite book|last=Chapman|first=edited by Alison|title=Elizabeth Gaskell: Mary Barton North and South|year=1999|publisher=Icon Books|location=Duxford|isbn=9781840460377}}</ref>

Gaskell's novels, with the exception of ''Cranford'', gradually slipped into obscurity during the late 19th century; before 1950, she was dismissed as a minor author with good judgment and  "feminine" sensibilities. Archie Stanton Whitfield wrote that her work was "like a nosegay of violets, honeysuckle, lavender, mignonette and sweet briar" in 1929.<ref>{{cite book|last=Whitfield|first=Archie Stanton|title=Mrs. Gaskell, Her Life and Works|year=1929|publisher=G. Routledge & sons|page=258}}</ref> Cecil (1934) said that she lacked the "masculinity" necessary to properly deal with social problems (Chapman, 1999, pp.&nbsp;39–40).

However, the critical tide began to turn in Gaskell's favour when, in the 1950s and 1960s, socialist critics like [[Kathleen Mary Tillotson|Kathleen Tillotson]], [[Arnold Kettle]] and [[Raymond Williams]] re-evaluated the description of social and industrial problems in her novels (see Moore, 1999<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drury.edu/multinl/story.cfm?ID=2466&NLID=166 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-06-14 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601222956/http://www.drury.edu/multinl/story.cfm?ID=2466&NLID=166 |archive-date=1 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> for an elaboration), and—realizing that her vision went against the prevailing views of the time—saw it as preparing the way for vocal [[feminist movement]]s.<ref>Stoneman, Patsy (1987). Elizabeth Gaskell. Bloomington: Indiana University Press. {{ISBN|9780253301031}}, p. 3.</ref>
In the early 21st century, with Gaskell's work "enlisted in contemporary negotiations of nationhood as well as gender and class identities",<ref>{{cite book|last=Matus|first=edited by Jill L.|title=The Cambridge companion to Elizabeth Gaskell|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=9780521846769|edition=repr.}}, p. 9.</ref> ''North and South'' – one of the first industrial novels describing the conflict between employers and workers – was recognized as depicting complex social conflicts and offering more satisfactory solutions through Margaret Hale: spokesperson for the author and Gaskell's most mature creation.<ref>Pearl L. Brown. "From Elizabeth Gaskell's Mary Barton To Her North And South: Progress Or Decline For Women?" ''Victorian Literature and Culture'', 28, pp. 345–358.</ref>

In her introduction to ''The Cambridge Companion to Elizabeth Gaskell'' (2007), a collection of essays representing the current Gaskell scholarship, Jill L. Matus stresses the author's growing stature in Victorian literary studies and how her innovative, versatile storytelling addressed the rapid changes during her lifetime.

==Literary style and themes==
[[File:Miss Matty and Peter.jpg|thumb|right|240px|A scene from [[Cranford (novel)|''Cranford'']], illustrated by [[Sybil Tawse]].]]
Gaskell's first novel, ''[[Mary Barton]]'', was published anonymously in 1848. The best-known of her remaining novels are ''[[Cranford (novel)|Cranford]]'' (1853), ''[[North and South (1854 novel)|North and South]]'' (1854), and ''[[Wives and Daughters]]'' (1865). She became popular for her writing, especially her ghost stories, aided by [[Charles Dickens]], who published her work in his magazine ''[[Household Words]]''. Her ghost stories are in the "[[Gothic fiction|Gothic]]" vein, making them quite distinct from her "industrial" fiction.

Even though her writing conforms to Victorian conventions, including the use of the name "Mrs. Gaskell", she usually framed her stories as critiques of contemporary attitudes. Her early works focused on factory work in the Midlands. She usually emphasized the role of women, with complex narratives and realistic female characters.<ref>Excluding reference to Gaskell's Ghost Stories, Abrams, M.&nbsp;H., et al. (eds), "Elizabeth Gaskell, 1810–1865". ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature, The Major Authors: The Romantic Period through the Twentieth Century'', 7th ed., Vol.&nbsp;B. New York, London: W.W. Norton & Company, 2001. {{ISBN|0-393-97304-2}}. DDC 820.8—dc21. LC PR1109.N6.</ref> Gaskell said she was influenced by the writings of [[Jane Austen]]. She then felt qualified to write a book on one of the greatest authors of all time, smoothing over patches in her life that were too rough for the sophisticated society woman.<ref>{{cite book|title=Women of Words|last=Teacher|first=Janet Bukovinsky|publisher=Courage Books|year=1994|isbn=9781561387694|location=Frankfort, Germany|pages=[https://archive.org/details/womenofwordspers00buko/page/24 24]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/womenofwordspers00buko/page/24}}</ref> Her treatment of class continues to interest social historians as well as fiction lovers.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Children in Early Victorian England: Infant Feeding in Literature and Society, 1837-1857|first=V.|last=PHILLIPS|date=1 August 1978|journal=Journal of Tropical Pediatrics|volume=24|issue=4|pages=158–166|doi=10.1093/tropej/24.4.158|pmid=364073}}</ref>

===Themes===
[[Unitarianism]] urges comprehension and tolerance toward all religions and even though Gaskell tried to keep her own beliefs hidden, she felt strongly about these values which permeated her works; in ''North and South'', "Margaret the Churchwoman, her father the [[Dissenter]], Higgins the [[Infidel]], knelt down together. It did them no harm."<ref>{{cite book |title=North and South |last=Gaskell |first=Elizabeth |year=1854–55 |publisher=Penguin Popular Classics |isbn=978-0-14-062019-1|page=277}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Elizabeth Gaskell |last=Easson |first=Angus |year=1979 |publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul |isbn=0-7100-0099-5 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/elizabethgaskell0000eass/page/12 12–17] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/elizabethgaskell0000eass/page/12 }}</ref>

===Dialect usage===
Gaskell's style is notable for putting local dialect words into the mouths of middle-class characters and the narrator. In ''North and South'' Margaret Hale suggests ''[[wikt:redd|redding]] up'' (tidying) the Bouchers' house and even offers jokingly to teach her mother words such as ''[[wikt:knobstick|knobstick]]'' (strike-breaker).<ref name="Ingham">Ingham, P. (1995). Introduction to the Penguin Classics edition of ''North and South''.</ref> In 1854 she defended her use of dialect to express otherwise inexpressible concepts in a letter to [[Walter Savage Landor]]:

{{quote|...&nbsp;you will remember the country people's use of the word "[[wikt:unked|unked]]". I can't find any other word to express the exact feeling of strange unusual desolate discomfort, and I sometimes "[[wikt:potter|potter]]" and "[[wikt:mither|mither]]" people by using it.<ref name="Ingham" /><ref name="Letters">Chapple JAV, Pollard A, eds. ''The Letters of Mrs Gaskell''. Mandolin (Manchester University Press), 1997</ref>}}

She also used the dialect word "[[nesh]]" (soft), which goes back to [[Old English]], in ''Mary Barton'':

{{quote|Sit you down here: the grass is well nigh dry by this time; and you're neither of you nesh folk about taking cold.<ref>{{cite book | last = Gaskell | first = E. | year = 1848 | title = Mary Barton | url = https://archive.org/details/marybartonbyecg01bartgoog | chapter = 1}}.</ref>}}

also in "North and South":

{{quote|And I did na like to be reckoned nesh and soft,<ref>{{cite book |title=North and South |last=Gaskell |first=Elizabeth |year=1854–55 |publisher=Penguin Popular Classics |isbn=978-0-14-062019-1}}</ref>}}

and later in "The Manchester Marriage" (1858):

{{quote|Now, I'm not above being neshed for other folks myself. I can stand a good blow, and never change colour; but, set me in the operating-room in the Infirmary, and I turn as sick as a girl.
}}

and:

{{quote|
At Mrs Wilson's death Norah came back to them, as a nurse to the newly-born little Edwin; into which post she was not installed without a pretty strong oration on the part of the proud and happy father; who declared that if he found out that Norah ever tried to screen the boy by falsehood, or to make him nesh either in body or mind, she should go that very day.<ref>{{cite book | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15252/15252.txt | series = Victorian Short Stories | title = Stories of Successful Marriages | publisher=The Project Gutenberg}}.</ref>

==Legacy==
The house on Plymouth Grove remained in the Gaskell family until 1913, after which it stood empty and fell into disrepair. The [[University of Manchester]] acquired it in 1969 and in 2004 it was acquired by the Manchester Historic Buildings Trust, which then raised money to restore it. Exterior renovations were completed in 2011 and the house is now open to the public.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elizabethgaskellhouse.co.uk/|title=Elizabeth Gaskell's House|website=www.elizabethgaskellhouse.org|access-date=1 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-13357245 |work=BBC News | title=Elizabeth Gaskell's house damaged after lead theft | date=11 May 2011}}</ref> On 25 September 2010, a memorial to Elizabeth Gaskell was dedicated to [[Poets' Corner]] in [[Westminster Abbey]].
