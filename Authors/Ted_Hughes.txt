==Biography==

===Early life===
[[File:Ted Hughes Birthplace.jpg|left|thumb|Hughes's birthplace in [[Mytholmroyd]], [[Yorkshire]]]]
Hughes was born at 1 Aspinall Street, in [[Mytholmroyd]] in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], to William Henry (1894–1981) and Edith (Farrar) Hughes (1898–1969),<ref>

Hughes's sister Olwyn Marguerite Hughes (1928–2016) was two years older and his brother Gerald (1920–2016)<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2016/08/15/gerald-hughes-brother-of-ted--obituary/|title=Gerald Hughes, brother of Ted – obituary|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=15 August 2016|access-date=1 December 2018|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref> was ten years older than himself.<ref name="Bellp4">Bell (2002) p4</ref> One of his mother's ancestors had founded the [[Little Gidding community]].<ref name="NDB">{{cite ODNB |last=Sagar |first=Keith |chapter=Hughes, Edward James (1930–1998) |title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |url=https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-71121 |year=2004 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/71121 |isbn=978-0-19-861412-8 |access-date=9 May 2020 |url-access=registration}}</ref> Most of the more recent generations of his family had worked in the clothing and milling industries in the area. Hughes's father, William, a joiner, was of Irish descent<ref>Paul Bentley, "Ted Hughes, Class and Violence", 2014, pp 63 and 64</ref><ref>Gerald Hughes, "Ted and I: A Brother's Memoir", 2014, p 4</ref> and had enlisted with the [[Lancashire Fusiliers]] in the [[First World War]] and fought at [[Ypres]]. He narrowly escaped being killed when a bullet lodged in a pay book in his breast pocket.<ref name="NDB"/> He was one of just 17 men of his regiment to return from the [[Gallipoli Campaign|Dardanelles Campaign]] (1915–16).<ref>{{cite book| last = Sagar| first = Keith| title = The Achievement of Ted Hughes| year = 1983| publisher = Manchester University Press| isbn = 978-0-7190-0939-6 | page = 9 }}</ref> The stories of [[Western Front (World War I)|Flanders fields]] filled Hughes's childhood imagination (later described in the poem "Out").<ref name="Sagar6"/>  Hughes noted, "my first six years shaped everything".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ann.skea.com/timeline.htm|title=Ted Hughes Timeline - publications, life-events etc.|access-date=11 April 2017}}</ref>

Hughes loved hunting and fishing, swimming and picnicking with his family. He attended the Burnley Road School until he was seven before his family moved to [[Mexborough]], then attending Schofield Street junior school.<ref name="NDB"/> His parents ran a newsagent's and tobacconist's shop.<ref name="Bellp4"/> In ''Poetry in Making'' he recalled that he was fascinated by animals, collecting and drawing toy lead creatures. He acted as retriever when his elder brother gamekeeper shot magpies, owls, rats and curlews, growing up surrounded by the harsh realities of working farms in the valleys and on the moors.<ref name="Sagar6">Sagar (1978), p6</ref>  During his time in Mexborough, he explored Manor Farm at Old [[Denaby]], which he said he would come to know "better than any place on earth". His earliest poem "The Thought Fox", and earliest story "The Rain Horse"  were recollections of the area. A close friend at the time, John Wholly, took Hughes to the Crookhill estate above [[Conisbrough]] where the boys spent great swathes of time. Hughes became close to the family and learnt a lot about wildlife from Wholly's father, a gamekeeper. He came to view fishing as an almost religious experience.<ref name="NDB"/>

Hughes attended [[Laurel Academy|Mexborough Grammar School]], where a succession of teachers encouraged him to write, and develop his interest in poetry. Teachers Miss McLeod and Pauline Mayne introduced him to the poets [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]] and [[T.S. Eliot]]. Hughes was mentored by his sister Olwyn, who was well versed in poetry, and another teacher, John Fisher.<ref name="NDB"/><ref name="Sagar7"/> Poet [[Harold Massingham]] also attended this school and was also mentored by Fisher. In 1946, one of Hughes's early poems, "Wild West", and a short story were published in the grammar school magazine ''The Don and Dearne'', followed by further poems in 1948.<ref name="Bellp4"/> By 16, he had no other thought than being a poet.<ref name="NDB"/>

During the same year, Hughes won an open [[exhibition (scholarship)|exhibition]] in English at [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]], but chose to do his [[national service]] first.<ref>Keith M. Sagar (1981). ''Ted Hughes'' p.9. University of Michigan</ref> His two years of national service (1949–51) passed comparatively easily. Hughes was stationed as a ground wireless mechanic in the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] on an isolated three-man station in east Yorkshire, a time during which he had nothing to do but "read and reread Shakespeare and watch the grass grow".<ref name="Bellp4"/> He learnt many of the plays by heart and memorised great quantities of [[W. B. Yeats]]'s poetry.<ref name="NDB"/>

===Career===
In 1951, Hughes initially studied English at Pembroke College under M.J.C. Hodgart, an authority on [[ballad]]ic forms. Hughes felt encouraged and supported by Hodgart's supervision, but attended few lectures and wrote no more poetry at this time, feeling stifled by literary academia and the "terrible, suffocating, maternal octopus" of literary tradition.<ref name="NDB"/><ref name="Sagar8">Sagar (1978), p. 8</ref> He wrote, "I might say, that I had as much talent for [[F. R. Leavis|Leavis]]-style dismantling of texts as anyone else, I even had a special bent for it, nearly a sadistic streak there, but it seemed to me not only a foolish game, but deeply destructive of myself."<ref name="NDB"/> In his third year, he transferred to [[Anthropology]] and [[Archaeology]], both of which would later inform his poetry.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://clok.uclan.ac.uk/11820/9/11820_%27Throttle%20College%27_%20Ted%20Hughes%27s%20Cambridge%20Poetry.pdf |title='Throttle College'? Ted Hughes's Cambridge Poetry |author-link=Yvonne Reddick |publisher=University of Central Lancashire |date=September 2015|access-date=23 October 2021}}</ref> He did not excel as a scholar, receiving only a third-class grade in Part I of the Anthropology and Archaeology Tripos in 1954.<ref name="Bellp5">Bell (2002), p. 5</ref><ref>'Cambridge Tripos', ''Times'', 19 June 1954, p. 3.</ref> His first published poetry appeared in ''Chequer''.<ref name="Bellp5"/> A poem, "The little boys and the seasons", written during this time, was published in ''[[Granta]]'', under the pseudonym Daniel Hearing.<ref name="Sagar9">Sagar (1978), p. 9</ref>

After university, living in London and Cambridge, Hughes went on to have many varied jobs including working as a rose gardener, a nightwatchman and a reader for the British film company [[Rank Organisation|J. Arthur Rank]]. He worked at [[London Zoo]] as a washer-upper,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/tobias-hill-tales-from-decrypt-99601.html|title=Tobias Hill: Tales from decrypt|date=9 August 2003|newspaper =The Independent=|access-date=23 June 2017}}</ref> a post that offered plentiful opportunities to observe animals at close quarters.<ref name="Bellp5"/> On 25 February 1956,<ref>Jonathan Bate (2015). ''Ted Hughes: the unauthorised life'' p. 98</ref> Hughes and his friends held a party to launch ''[[St. Botolph's Review]]'', which had a single issue. In it, Hughes had four poems. At the party, he met the American poet [[Sylvia Plath]], who was studying at Cambridge on a [[Fulbright Scholarship]].<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2010/apr/15/sylvia-plath-ted-hughes "Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes talk about their relationship"], ''Guardian'', 15 April 2010.

There was a great mutual attraction but they did not meet again for another month, when Plath was passing through London on her way to Paris. She visited him again on her return three weeks later.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

|quote =<poem>
Cold, delicately as the dark snow,
A fox’s nose touches twig, leaf;
Two eyes serve a movement, that now
And again now, and now, and now

Sets neat prints into the snow
Between trees, and warily a lame
Shadow lags by stump and in hollow
Of a body that is bold to come

Across clearings, an eye,
A widening deepening greenness,
Brilliantly, concentratedly,
Coming about its own business

Till, with a sudden sharp hot stink of fox
It enters the dark hole of the head.
The window is starless still; the clock ticks,
The page is printed.

Hughes and Plath dated and then were married at [[St George the Martyr, Holborn]], on 16 June 1956, four months after they had first met. The date, [[Bloomsday]], was purposely chosen in honour of [[James Joyce]].<ref name="NDB"/> Plath's mother was the only wedding guest and she accompanied them on their honeymoon to [[Benidorm]] on the Spanish coast.<ref name="Bellp6">Bell (2002), p. 6</ref> Hughes's biographers note that Plath did not relate her history of depression and suicide attempts to him until much later.<ref name="NDB"/> Reflecting later in ''Birthday Letters'', Hughes commented that early on he could see chasms of difference between himself and Plath, but that in the first years of their marriage they both felt happy and supported, avidly pursuing their writing careers.<ref name="Bellp6"/>

On returning to Cambridge, they lived at 55 Eltisley Avenue. That year they each had poems published in ''[[The Nation]]'', ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'' and ''[[The Atlantic]]''.<ref name="Sagar11">Sagar (1978), p. 11</ref> Plath typed up Hughes's manuscript for his collection ''Hawk in the Rain'' which went on to win a poetry competition run by the Poetry centre of the [[Jewish Community Centre|Young Men's and Young Women's Hebrew Association of New York]].<ref name="Bellp6"/> The first prize was publication by [[HarperCollins|Harper]], garnering Hughes widespread critical acclaim with the book's release in September 1957, and resulting in him winning a [[Somerset Maugham Award]]. The work favoured hard-hitting [[trochee]]s and [[spondee]]s reminiscent of [[Middle English]] – a style he used throughout his career – over the more genteel latinate sounds.<ref name="NDB"/>

The couple moved to America so that Plath could take a teaching position at her alma mater, [[Smith College]]; during this time, Hughes taught at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst|University of Massachusetts]], Amherst. In 1958, they met [[Leonard Baskin]], who would later illustrate many of Hughes's books, including ''Crow''.<ref name="Bellp6"/> The couple returned to England, staying for a short while back in [[Heptonstall]] and then finding a small flat in [[Primrose Hill]], London. They were both writing, Hughes working on programmes for the BBC as well as producing essays, articles, reviews and talks.<ref name="Bellp7">Bell, Charlie (2002) ''Ted Hughes'' Hodder and Stoughton, p. 7<!--ISSN/ISBN needed--></ref> During this time, he wrote the poems that would be published in ''Wodwo'' (1967) and ''Recklings'' (1966). In March 1960, ''Lupercal'' came out and won the [[Hawthornden Prize]]. He found he was being labelled as the poet of the wild, writing only about animals.<ref name="NDB"/> He began to seriously explore myth and esoteric practices including shamanism, alchemy and Buddhism with [[The Tibetan Book of the Dead]] being a particular focus in the early 1960’s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rácz|first=István D.|date=1991|title=THE REALM BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH IN TED HUGHES|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41273855|journal=Hungarian Studies in English|volume=22|pages=121–126|issn=1217-0283}}</ref> He believed that imagination could heal dualistic splits in the human psyche and poetry was the language of that work.<ref name="NDB"/>

Hughes and Plath had two children, [[Frieda Hughes|Frieda Rebecca]] (b. 1960) and [[Nicholas Hughes|Nicholas Farrar]] (1962–2009) and, in 1961, bought the house [[Court Green]], in [[North Tawton]], [[Devon]]. In the summer of 1962, Hughes began an affair with [[Assia Wevill]] who had been subletting the Primrose Hill flat with her husband. Under the cloud of his affair, Hughes and Plath separated in the autumn of 1962 and she set up life in a new flat with the children.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

In 2017, previously unpublished letters written by Plath between 18 February 1960 and 4 February 1963 accuse Hughes of physically abusing her months before she miscarried their second child in 1961.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/11/unseen-sylvia-plath-letters-claim-domestic-abuse-by-ted-hughes?CMP=fb_gu|title=Unseen Sylvia Plath letters claim domestic abuse by Ted Hughes|first=Danuta|last=Kean|date=11 April 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=11 April 2017}}</ref>

===Death of Sylvia Plath===

Beset by depression made worse by her husband's affair and with a history of suicide attempts, Plath took her own life on 11 February 1963, although it is unclear whether she meant to ultimately succeed.<ref name="Bellp8">Bell, Charlie (2002) ''Ted Hughes'' Hodder and Stoughton p8</ref> Hughes dramatically wrote in a letter to an old friend of Plath's from Smith College, "That's the end of my life.

In ''The Guardian'' on 20 April 1989, Hughes wrote the article "The Place Where Sylvia Plath Should Rest in Peace":
<blockquote>
In the years soon after [Plath's] death, when scholars approached me, I tried to take their apparently serious concern for the truth about Sylvia Plath seriously. But I learned my lesson early... If I tried too hard to tell them exactly how something happened, in the hope of correcting some fantasy, I was quite likely to be accused of trying to suppress Free Speech. In general, my refusal to have anything to do with the Plath Fantasia has been regarded as an attempt to suppress Free Speech... The Fantasia about Sylvia Plath is more needed than the facts. Where that leaves respect for the truth of her life (and of mine), or for her memory, or for the literary tradition, I do not know.<ref name="Reading Women"/><ref>Hughes, Ted. "The Place Where Sylvia Plath Should Rest in Peace". ''Guardian'' Article. 20 April 1989</ref>
</blockquote>

As Plath's widower, Hughes became the executor of Plath's personal and literary estates. He oversaw the publication of her manuscripts, including ''[[Ariel (Plath)|Ariel]]'' (1965). Some critics were dissatisfied by his choice of poem order and omissions in the book<ref name="Bellp8"/> and some critics of Hughes argued that he had essentially driven her to suicide and therefore should not be responsible for her literary legacy.<ref name="Bellp8"/>  He claimed to have destroyed the final volume of Plath's journal, detailing their last few months together. In his foreword to ''The Journals of Sylvia Plath'', he defends his actions as a consideration for the couple's young children.

<!-- Commented out: [[File:Sylvia plath.jpg|thumb|right|Hughes's wife [[Sylvia Plath]]]] -->
Following Plath's suicide, he wrote two poems "The Howling of Wolves" and "Song of a Rat" and then did not write poetry again for three years. He broadcast extensively, wrote critical essays and became involved in running Poetry International with [[Patrick Garland]] and [[Charles Osborne (music writer)|Charles Osborne]] in the hopes of connecting English poetry with the rest of the world. In 1966, he wrote poems to accompany [[Leonard Baskin]]'s illustrations of crows, which became the epic narrative ''[[Crow (poetry)|The Life and Songs of the Crow]]'', one of the works for which Hughes is best known.<ref name="NDB"/> In 1967, while living with Wevill, Hughes produced two sculptures of a jaguar, one of which he gave to his brother and one to his sister; Gerald Hughes' sculpture, branded with the letter 'A' on its forehead, was offered for sale in 2012.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/31/ted-hughes-jaguar-sculpture-sale |title=Ted Hughes's jaguar sculpture hints at poet's demons |quote=Poet's family to sell rare jaguar sculpture that they believe shows his pain over Sylvia Plath's death |date=31 December 2011 |website=The Guardian|access-date=20 June 2021}}</ref>

On 23 March 1969, six years after Plath's suicide by asphyxiation from a gas stove, Assia Wevill died by suicide in the same way. Wevill also killed her child, Alexandra Tatiana Elise (nicknamed Shura), the four-year-old daughter of Hughes, born on 3 March 1965. Their deaths led to claims that Hughes had been abusive to both Plath and Wevill.<ref>{{cite news|author=Nadeem Azam |url=http://1lit.tripod.com/june2001.html |title=''Ted Hughes: A Talented Murderer'' Guardian article on Hughes' relationship with Plath and Welville 11 December 2001 |work=The Guardian |date= 2001|access-date=17 February 2018 | location=London}}</ref><ref name="I failed her">[http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/poetry/story/0,6000,148915,00.html ''I failed her.

In August 1970, Hughes married Carol Orchard, a nurse, and they remained together until his death. He bought the house Lumb Bank near [[Hebden Bridge]], [[West Yorkshire]], and maintained the property at [[Court Green]]. He began cultivating a small farm near [[Winkleigh]], [[Devon]] called ''Moortown'', a name which became embedded in the title of one of his poetry collections. He later became President of the charity [[Farms for City Children]], established by his friend [[Michael Morpurgo]] in [[Iddesleigh]].<ref name=hatherleigh/> In October 1970, ''Crow'' was published.

In 1970, he and his sister, Olwyn (26 August 1928 – 3 January 2016),<ref>{{cite news|last1=Guttridge|first1=Peter|title=Olwyn Hughes: Literary agent who fiercely guarded the work of her brother, Ted Hughes, and his wife, Sylvia Plath|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/olwyn-hughes-literary-agent-who-fiercely-guarded-the-work-of-her-brother-ted-hughes-and-his-wife-a6799816.html|access-date=10 January 2016|work=The Independent|date=7 January 2016}}</ref> set up the Rainbow Press, which published sixteen titles between 1971 and 1981, comprising poems by Sylvia Plath, Ted Hughes, [[Ruth Fainlight]], [[Thom Gunn]] and [[Seamus Heaney]], printed by Daedalus Press, [[Rampant Lions Press]] and the John Roberts Press.

Hughes was appointed Poet Laureate in December 1984, following Sir [[John Betjeman]]. A collection of animal poems for children had been published by Faber earlier that year, ''What is the Truth?'', illustrated by R. J. Lloyd. For that work he won the annual [[Guardian Children's Fiction Prize]], a once-in-a-lifetime book award.<ref name=relaunch/> Hughes wrote many works for children and collaborated closely with [[Peter Brook]] and the [[National Theatre Company]].<ref name="Bellp10"/> He dedicated himself to the [[Arvon Foundation]] which promotes writing education and runs residential writing courses at Hughes's home at Lumb Bank, West Yorkshire.<ref name="Bellp10">Bell, Charlie (2002) ''Ted Hughes'' Hodder and Stoughton, p. 10</ref> In 1993, he made a rare television appearance for [[Channel 4]], which included him reading passages from his 1968 novel [[The Iron Man (novel)|''The Iron Man'']].  He also featured in the 1994 documentary ''Seven Crows A Secret''.<ref>{{YouTube|oQ0xVki00nU|''Seven Crows A Secret''}}</ref>

In early 1994, Hughes became increasingly alarmed by the decline of fish in rivers local to his Devonshire home. This concern inspired him to become one of the original trustees of the [[Westcountry Rivers Trust]], a charity set up to restore rivers through catchment-scale management and a close relationship with local landowners and riparian owners.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://wrt.org.uk/the-westcountry-rivers-trust-story/|title=The Westcountry Rivers Trust Story|date=25 May 2017|work=Westcountry Rivers Trust News|access-date=16 June 2017}}</ref>

Hughes was appointed a member of the [[Order of Merit]] by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] just before he died. He continued to live at the house in Devon, until suffering a fatal [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on 28 October 1998 while undergoing hospital treatment for [[colon cancer]] in [[London Borough of Southwark|Southwark]], London. His funeral was held on 3 November 1998, at [[North Tawton]] church, and he was cremated in [[Exeter]]. Speaking at the funeral, fellow poet [[Seamus Heaney]], said: "No death outside my immediate family has left me feeling more bereft. No death in my lifetime has hurt poets more. He was a tower of tenderness and strength, a great arch under which the least of poetry's children could enter and feel secure. His creative powers were, as Shakespeare said, still crescent. By his death, the veil of poetry is rent and the walls of learning broken."<ref>{{cite book| last = Boyanowsky| first = Ehor| title = Savage Gods, Silver Ghosts In the Wild With Ted Hughes| year = 2010| publisher = Douglas & McIntyre Limited| isbn = 978-1-55365-323-3 | page = 195}}</ref>

[[Nicholas Hughes]], the son of Hughes and Plath, committed suicide in his home in [[Alaska]] on 16 March 2009 after suffering from depression.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/books/03/23/plath.son.suicide/index.html|title=Tragic poet Sylvia Plath's son kills himself|publisher=CNN|date=23 March 2009|access-date=16 July 2010}}</ref>

Carol Hughes announced in January 2013 that she would write a memoir of their marriage. ''[[The Times]]'' headlined its story "Hughes's widow breaks silence to defend his name" and observed that "for more than 40 years she has kept her silence, never once joining in the furious debate that has raged around the late Poet Laureate since the suicide of his first wife, the poet Sylvia Plath."<ref>[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/books/poetry/article3649670.ece "My life with Ted: Hughes’s widow breaks silence to defend his name"].

A memoir by Hughes's brother Gerald was published late in 2014, ''Ted and I: A Brother's Memoir'', which ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' calls "a warm recollection of a lauded poet".<ref>[https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/gerald-hughes/ted-and-i "Ted and I: A Brother's Memoir by Gerald Hughes"].

==Work==
[[File:Poet Ted HughesDCP 2068.JPG|thumb|right| ''Homage to Ted Hughes'' by [[Reginald Gray (artist)|Reginald Gray]] (2004), [[Bankfield Museum]], [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]]]]
Hughes's first collection, ''[[The Hawk in the Rain]]'' (1957), attracted considerable critical acclaim. In 1959 he won the Galbraith prize, which brought $5,000. His most significant work is perhaps ''[[Crow (poetry)|Crow]]'' (1970), which whilst it has been widely praised also divided critics, combining an apocalyptic, bitter, cynical and surreal view of the universe with what sometimes appeared simple, childlike verse. Crow was edited several times across Hughes' career. Within its opus he created a cosmology of the totemic Crow who was simultaneously God, Nature and Hughes' alter ego. The publication of ''Crow'' shaped Hughes' poetic career as distinct from other forms of English Nature Poetry.

In a 1971 interview with ''[[The London Magazine]]'', Hughes cited his main influences as including [[William Blake|Blake]], [[John Donne|Donne]], [[Gerard Manley Hopkins|Hopkins]] and [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]]. He mentioned also [[Schopenhauer]], [[Robert Graves]]'s book ''The White Goddess'' and ''[[Bardo Thodol|The Tibetan Book of the Dead]]''.<ref name="Bell11">Bell (2002) p11</ref>

Hughes worked for 10 years on a [[prose poem]], "Gaudete", which he hoped to have made into a film. It tells the story of the vicar of an English village who is carried off by elemental spirits, and replaced in the village by his [[Enantiodromia|enantiodromic]] double, a changeling, fashioned from a log, who nevertheless has the same memories as the original vicar. The double is a force of nature who organises the women of the village into a "love coven" in order that he may father a new messiah. When the male members of the community discover what is going on, they murder him. The epilogue consists of a series of lyrics spoken by the restored priest in praise of a nature goddess, inspired by [[Robert Graves]]'s ''White Goddess''. It was printed in 1977. Hughes was very interested in the relationship between his poetry and the book arts, and many of his books were produced by notable presses and in collaborative editions with artists, for instance with [[Leonard Baskin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hydrohotel.net/Hughes1.htm |title=Richard Price, Ted Hughes and the Book Arts |publisher=Hydrohotel.net |date=17 August 1930 |access-date=27 April 2010}}</ref>

In addition to his own poetry, Hughes wrote a number of translations of European plays, mainly classical ones. His ''[[Tales from Ovid]]'' (1997) contains a selection of [[free verse]] translations from [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]''. He also wrote both poetry and prose for children, one of his most successful books being ''[[The Iron Man (novel)|The Iron Man]]'', written to comfort his children after their mother Sylvia Plath's suicide. It later became the basis of [[Pete Townshend]]'s 1989 [[rock opera]] of the same name, and of the 1999 animated film ''[[The Iron Giant]]'', the latter of which is dedicated to his memory. 

Hughes was appointed [[Poet Laureate]] in 1984 following the death of [[John Betjeman]]. It was later known that Hughes was second choice for the appointment. [[Philip Larkin]], the preferred nominee, had declined, because of ill health and a loss of creative momentum, dying a year later. Hughes served in this position until his death in 1998. In 1992 Hughes published ''[[Shakespeare and the Goddess of Complete Being]]'', a monumental work inspired by Graves's ''[[The White Goddess]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faber.co.uk/work/shakespeare-and-goddess-of-complete-being/9780571166046/|title=Shakespeare and the Goddess of Complete Being|website=Faber.co.uk|access-date=23 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101010341/http://www.faber.co.uk/work/shakespeare-and-goddess-of-complete-being/9780571166046|archive-date=1 January 2011}}</ref> The book, considered Hughes's key work of prose, had a mixed reception "divided between those who considered it an important and original appreciation of Shakespeare’s complete works, whilst others dismissed it as a lengthy and idiosyncratic appreciation of Shakespeare refracted by Hughes’s personal belief system". Hughes himself later suggested that the time spent writing prose was directly responsible for a decline in his health.<ref name=journal>{{cite web |url=http://www.thetedhughessociety.org/life.htm |title=Life – The Ted Hughes Society Journal |publisher=Thetedhughessociety.org |access-date=7 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812051354/http://www.thetedhughessociety.org/life.htm |archive-date=12 August 2014 }}</ref> Also in 1992, Hughes published ''Rain Charm for the Duchy'', collecting together for the first time his Laureate works, including poems celebrating important royal occasions. The book also contained a section of notes throwing light on the context and genesis of each poem.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.faber.co.uk/catalog/rain-charm-for-the-duchy/9780571167135 |title=Rain Charm for the Duchy, Ted Hughes |publisher=Faber.co.uk |date=22 June 1992 |access-date=7 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810044424/http://www.faber.co.uk/catalog/rain-charm-for-the-duchy/9780571167135 |archive-date=10 August 2014 }}</ref>

In 1998, his ''[[Tales from Ovid]]'' won the [[Costa Book Awards|Whitbread Book of the Year Award]]. In ''[[Birthday Letters]]'', his last collection, Hughes broke his silence on Plath, detailing aspects of their life together and his own behaviour at the time. The book, the cover artwork for which was by their daughter [[Frieda Hughes|Frieda]], won the 1999 [[Whitbread Prize]] for poetry.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/ted-hughes-wins-whitbread-prize-1046684.html|title=Ted Hughes wins Whitbread prize|date=13 January 1999|access-date=11 April 2017}}</ref>

Hughes's definitive 1,333-page ''Collected Poems'' (Faber & Faber) appeared (posthumously) in 2003. A poem discovered in October 2010, "Last letter", describes what happened during the three days leading up to Plath's suicide.<ref name="lastletter">{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/cultural-capital/2010/10/hughes-poem-poet-publish|title=Exclusive: Ted Hughes's poem on the night Sylvia Plath died|access-date=11 April 2017}}</ref> It was published in ''[[New Statesman]]'' on National Poetry Day, October 2010.
Poet Laureate [[Carol Ann Duffy]] told [[Channel 4 News]] that the poem was "the darkest poem he has ever written" and said that for her it was "almost unbearable to read".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/newly-discovered-ted-hughes-poem|title=Newly discovered Ted Hughes poem|date=6 October 2010|access-date=11 April 2017}}</ref>

In 2011, several previously unpublished letters from Hughes to [[Craig Raine]] were published in the literary review [[Areté]].<ref>Areté, Issue 34, Spring/Summer 2011</ref> They relate mainly to the process of editing ''Shakespeare and the Goddess of Complete Being'', and also contain a sequence of drafts of letters in which Raine attempts to explain to Hughes his disinclination to publish Hughes's poem ''The Cast'' in an anthology he was editing, on the grounds that it might open Hughes to further attack on the subject of Sylvia Plath. "Dear Ted, Thanks for the poem. It is very interesting and would cause a minor sensation" (4 April 1997). The poem was eventually published in ''Birthday Letters'' and Hughes makes a passing reference to this then unpublished collection: "I have a whole pile of pieces that are all – one way or another – little bombs for the studious and earnest to throw at me" (5 April 1997).

This house has been far out at sea all night,
The woods crashing through darkness, the booming hills,
Winds stampeding the fields under the window
Floundering black astride and blinding wet

Till day rose; then under an orange sky
The hills had new places, and wind wielded
Blade-light, luminous black and emerald,
Flexing like the lens of a mad eye.
</poem>
|source =From "Wind" <br/> ''[[The Hawk in the Rain]]'', 1957<ref name="poetryarchive.org"/>}}

Hughes's earlier poetic work is rooted in nature and, in particular, the innocent savagery of animals, an interest from an early age. He wrote frequently of the mixture of beauty and violence in the natural world.<ref name="Bellp1">Bell (2002) p1</ref> Animals serve as a metaphor for his view on life: animals live out a struggle for the [[survival of the fittest]] in the same way that humans strive for ascendancy and success. Examples can be seen in the poems "Hawk Roosting" and "Jaguar".<ref name="Bellp1"/>

The [[West Riding]] dialect of Hughes's childhood remained a staple of his poetry, his lexicon lending a texture that is concrete, terse, emphatic, economical yet powerful. The manner of speech renders the hard facts of things and wards off self-indulgence.<ref name="Sagar7">Sagar (1978) p7</ref>

Hughes's later work is deeply reliant upon myth and the British [[bard]]ic tradition, heavily inflected with a [[modernism|modernist]], [[Jungian]] and ecological viewpoint.<ref name="Bellp1"/> He re-worked classical and archetypal myth working with a conception of the dark sub-conscious.<ref name="Bellp1"/>

=== Translation ===
In 1965, he founded with [[Daniel Weissbort]] the journal ''[[Modern Poetry in Translation]]'', which involved bringing to the attention of the West the work of [[Czesław Miłosz]], who would later go on to win the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. Weissbort and Hughes were instrumental in bringing to the English-speaking world the work of many poets who were hardly known, from such countries as Poland and Hungary, then controlled by the Soviet Union. Hughes wrote an introduction to a translation of ''Vasko Popa: Collected Poems'', in the "Persea Series of Poetry in Translation", edited by Weissbort.<ref name="Bayley">{{cite news|url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1979/11/08/life-studies/|title=Life Studies|last=Bayley|first=John|journal=New York Review of Books|date=8 November 1979|access-date=4 August 2019|issn=0028-7504}}</ref> which was reviewed with favour by premiere literary critic John Bayley of Oxford University in ''The New York Review of Books''.<ref name="Bayley"/>

===Ted Hughes Paper Trail===
On 16 November 2013, Hughes's former hometown of [[Mexborough]] held a special performance trail, as part of its "Right Up Our Street" project, celebrating the writer's connection with the town. The free event included a two-hour ramble through Mexborough following the route of young Hughes's [[paper round]]. Participants visited some of the important locations which influenced the poet, with the trail beginning at Hughes's former home, which is now a furniture shop.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rotherhamadvertiser.co.uk/leisure/95369/mexborough-hosts-ted-hughes-paper-trail.aspx |title=Mexborough hosts Ted Hughes' paper trail |newspaper=Rotherham Advertiser |date=12 November 2013 |access-date=7 August 2014}}</ref>
