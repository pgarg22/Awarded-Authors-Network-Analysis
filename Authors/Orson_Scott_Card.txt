'''Orson Scott Card''' (born August 24, 1951) is an American writer known best for his [[science fiction]] works. He is currently the only person to win both a [[Hugo Award for Best Novel|Hugo]] [[Hugo Award|Award]] and a [[Nebula Award for Best Novel|Nebula]] [[Nebula Award|Award]] in [[List of joint winners of the Hugo and Nebula awards|consecutive years]], winning both awards for both his novel ''[[Ender's Game]]'' (1985) and its sequel ''[[Speaker for the Dead]]'' (1986) back-to-back. A feature film [[Ender's Game (film)|adaptation]] of ''Ender's Game'', which Card co-produced, was released in 2013. Card also wrote the [[Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel|Locus Fantasy Award]]-winning series ''[[The Tales of Alvin Maker]]'' (1987–2003).

Card's works were influenced by classic literature, popular fantasy, and science fiction; he often uses tropes from [[genre fiction]]. His background as a screenwriter has helped Card make his works accessible. Card's early fiction is original but contains graphic violence. His fiction often features characters with exceptional gifts who make difficult choices with high stakes. Card has also written political, religious, and social commentary in his columns and other writing. Card's opposition to homosexuality has provoked public criticism and in 2013 it prompted a boycott of the film ''[[Ender's Game (film)|Ender's Game]]''.

Card, who is a great-great-grandson of [[Brigham Young]], was born in [[Richland, Washington]], and grew up in [[Utah]] and [[California]]. While he was a student at [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU), his plays were performed on stage. He served in Brazil as a missionary for [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) and headed a community theater for two summers. Card had twenty-seven short stories published between 1978 and 1979, and won the [[Astounding Award for Best New Writer|John W. Campbell Award for best new writer]] in 1978. He earned a master's degree in English from the [[University of Utah]] in 1981 and wrote novels in science fiction, fantasy, non-fiction, and historical fiction genres in the 1980s. Card continued to write prolifically, and published over 50 novels and over 45 short stories.<ref name=mapsinmirror/>

Card teaches [[English studies|English]] at [[Southern Virginia University]]; he has written two books on [[creative writing]] and serves as a judge in the [[Writers of the Future]] contest. He is a practicing member of LDS Church and has taught many successful writers at his "literary boot camps." [[Mormon fiction]] writers [[Stephenie Meyer]], [[Brandon Sanderson]], and [[Dave Wolverton]] have cited his works as a major influence.

===Childhood and education===
[[File:Scott Card.jpg|thumb|Card (right) signing autographs at [[New York Comic Con]] in 2008]]
Orson Scott Card was born on August 24, 1951, in [[Richland, Washington]].{{sfn|Tyson|2003|p=165}} He is the son of Peggy Jane (née Park) and Willard Richards Card, and is the third of six children and the older brother of composer and arranger [[Arlen Card]].{{sfn|Willett|2006|p=77}} Card's family has [[Mormon pioneers|Mormon pioneer]] heritage. His direct ancestors include [[Brigham Young]], [[Charles Ora Card]], [[Zina P. Young Card]], [[Zina Young Card Brown]] and [[Hugh B. Brown]].{{sfn|Willett|2006|p=13}}

When Card was one month old, his family moved to [[San Mateo, California]], so Willard Card could begin a sign-painting business. When he was three years old, the family moved to [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], so his father could finish his bachelor's degree. The family moved to [[Santa Clara, California]], when Card was six; they stayed there for seven years while his father completed his master's degree and worked as a professor at [[San Jose State University|San Jose State College]]. In school, Card took classes for gifted students but he was more interested in studying music—he played clarinet and French horn. He read widely, including historical fiction, nonfiction, and literary classics.{{sfn|Tyson|2003|p=xv}} At age ten, he wrote his first story, which was about an intelligent child who is assaulted by bullies and sustains [[brain damage]]. Ender's confrontation with Stilson in ''[[Ender's Game]]'' is based on this story.{{sfn|Tyson|2003|p=xvi}}
 
In 1964, Card and his family moved to [[Mesa, Arizona]], where he participated in mock debates in junior high school. In 1967, the family moved to [[Orem, Utah]], where his father worked at [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU). Card attended BYU's laboratory school, where he took both high school and early college-level classes before graduating in one year. When beginning his college studies he intended to major in anthropology, but after becoming increasingly more interested in theater, he began script-writing, writing ten original plays and rewriting other students' plays. Most of his plays were based on Mormon history and scriptures; one was science fiction. By watching the body language of an audience, he could tell when an audience was interested in his scripts.{{sfn|Tyson|2003|p=xvi}}<ref>{{cite web |last1=Card |first1=Orson Scott |title=About Orson Scott Card |url=http://www.hatrack.com/osc/about-more.shtml}}</ref> During his studies as a theater major, he began doctoring scripts, adapting fiction for [[Reader's theatre|reader's theater]] production, and writing one-act and full-length plays, several of which were produced by faculty directors at BYU.{{sfn|Willett|2006|pp=36–37}} [[Charles W.

Before graduating, Card served as a [[Missionary (LDS Church)|missionary]] for the LDS Church in Brazil starting in 1971. During his mission, he wrote a play called ''Stone Tables''.{{sfn|Tyson|2003|p=xvii}}<ref>{{cite news |title=Orson Scott Card |url=https://live.washingtonpost.com/orson-scott-card.html |access-date=25 September 2019 |work=The Washington Post |date=November 3, 2010}}</ref> He returned from his mission in 1973 and graduated from BYU in 1975, receiving a bachelor's degree with distinction in theater.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Groeger |first1=Gina |title=Orson Scott Card visits BYU |url=https://universe.byu.edu/2000/11/13/orson-scott-card-visits-byu/ |access-date=25 September 2019 |work=The Daily Universe |publisher=Brigham Young University |date=November 13, 2000}}</ref>{{sfn|Tyson|2003|p=xvii}} After graduation, he started the Utah Valley Repertory Theatre Company, which for two summers produced plays at "the Castle", a [[Great Depression|Depression-era]] outdoor amphitheater.{{sfn|Willett|2006|pp=38–42}} After going into debt with the community theatre's expenses,{{sfn|Van Name|1988|p=3}}<!--This source says $20,000 but Willet's says $600 and sources an e-mail from Card-->Card took part-time employment as a proofreader at [[BYU Press]], moving on to full-time employment as a copy editor.{{sfn|Willett|2006|pp=41–43}} In 1981, Card completed his [[master's degree]] in English at the [[University of Utah]] where he studied with [[François Camoin]] and [[Norman Council]]. He began a doctoral program at the [[University of Notre Dame]] but dropped out to pursue his more lucrative writing projects.{{sfn|Tyson|2003|p=xx}}<ref name="SVU"/>

===Personal life===
In 1977, Card married Kristine Allen,{{sfn|Tyson|2003|p=166}} who is the daughter of Mormon historian [[James B. Allen (historian)|James B.

In 1976 Card became an assistant editor at the LDS Church's magazine ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'' and moved to [[Salt Lake City]].{{sfn|Willett|2006|p=43}} While working at ''Ensign,'' Card published his first piece of fiction,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hall |first1=Andrew |title=Lifetime Achievement Awards: Orson Scott Card and Susan Elizabeth Howe |url=http://associationmormonletters.org/blog/2017/04/lifetime-achievement-awards-orson-scott-card-and-susan-elizabeth-howe/ |website=Dawning of a Brighter Day: Twenty-First Century Mormon Literature |publisher=Association for Mormon Letters |access-date=27 September 2019 }}</ref> a short story called ''[[Gert Fram]]'', which appeared in the July 1977 issue of ''Ensign'' under the pseudonym Byron Walley.<ref name="image">{{cite book |last1=Collings |first1=Michael R. |title=In the Image of God: Theme, Characterization, and Landscape in the Fiction of Orson Scott Card |date=1990 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Connecticut |isbn=031326404X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ft9au7vWKEAC&q=Orson+Scott+Card+%22Gert+Fram%22+Bryron+Walley&pg=PA157}}</ref>{{rp|157}} Between 1978 and 1988, Card wrote over 300 half-hour audioplays on [[History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS Church history]], the [[New Testament]], and other subjects for [[Living Scriptures, Inc|Living Scriptures]] in Ogden, Utah.{{sfn|Van Name|1988|p=5}}

Card started writing science fiction short stories because he felt he could sell short stories in that genre more easily than others.{{sfn|Van Name|1988|p=2; 5}} His first short story ''The Tinker'' was initially rejected by ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact]]''. [[Ben Bova]], the editor of ''Analog'', rejected a rewrite of the story but asked Card to submit a science fiction piece.{{sfn|Van Name|1988|p=2–4}} In response, Card wrote the short story ''[[Ender's Game (short story)|Ender's Game]]'', which Ben Bova published in the August 1977 issue of ''Analog''.{{sfn|Willett|2006|pp=42–43}} Card left ''The Ensign'' in 1977 and began his career as a freelance writer in 1978.{{sfn|Willett|2006|pp=43; 48}}<ref name=mapsinmirror>{{cite book |last1=Card |first1=Orson Scott |title=Maps in a Mirror: The Short Fiction of Orson Scott Card |date=1990 |publisher=ORB |location=New York |isbn=9780765308405 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FLNCovxKl7IC&pg=PA122 |access-date=30 September 2019}}</ref>{{rp|122}} Ben Bova continued to work with Card to publish his stories and his wife Barbara Bova became Card's literary agent, a development that drew criticism of a possible conflict of interest.<!--The people voicing this criticism are not articulated, but we assume that they are SF fans-->{{sfn|Lupoff|1991|p=121}} Nine of Card's science fiction stories, including ''Malpractice'', ''[[Kingsmeat]]'', and ''Happy Head'', were published in 1978.{{sfn|Collings|2001|pp=12; 292–294}}

Card modeled ''Mikal's Songbird'' on ''Ender's Game'', both of which include a child with special talents who goes through emotional turmoil when adults seek to exploit his ability.{{sfn|Willett|2006|p=56}} ''Mikal's Songbird'' was a [[Nebula Award]] finalist in 1978 and a Hugo finalist in 1979—both in the "novelette" category.<ref>{{cite web |title=1979 Hugo Awards |url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1979-hugo-awards/ |website=The Hugo Awards |access-date=18 February 2020 |date=26 July 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=sfadb: Nebula Awards 1979 |url=http://www.sfadb.com/Nebula_Awards_1979 |website=www.sfadb.com |access-date=18 February 2020}}</ref> Card won the John W.

In the early 1980s, Card focused on writing longer works, only publishing ten short stories between 1980 and 1985. He published a few non-fiction works that were aimed at an LDS audience; these include a satirical dictionary called ''Saintspeak'', which resulted in him being temporarily banned from publishing in church magazines.<ref name="locus">{{cite journal|date=June 1987|title=Orson Scott Card: Jack of Many Trades|journal=Locus|volume=20|issue=6|pages=56–58}}</ref> Card wrote the fantasy-epic ''[[Hart's Hope]]'' (1983) and a historical novel, ''A Woman of Destiny'' (1984), which was later republished as ''[[Saints (novel)|Saints]]'' and won the 1985 [[AML Awards|award]] from the [[Association for Mormon Letters]] for best novel.{{sfn|Collings|2001|p=13}} He rewrote the narrative of ''Hot Sleep'' and published it as ''[[The Worthing Chronicle]]'' (1983), which replaced ''Hot Sleep'' and the short-story collection set in the same universe, ''[[Capitol (short story collection)|Capitol]]'' (1979).{{sfn|Tyson|2003|p=xx}} The recession of the early 1980s made it difficult to get contracts for new books so Card returned to full-time employment as the book editor of ''[[Compute!]]'' magazine that was based in Greensboro, North Carolina, for nine months in 1983.{{sfn|Willett|2006|p=60–61}} In October of that year, Tom Doherty offered a contract for Card's proposed Alvin Maker series, which allowed him to return to creative writing full-time.{{sfn|Willett|2006|pp=62–63}}

===Late 1980's: ''Ender's Game'' and short stories===
{{See also|Ender's Game (novel series)}}
Card's 1977 [[novella]] ''[[Ender's Game (short story)|Ender's Game]]'' is about a young boy who undergoes military training for space war. Ender believes he is controlling simulated spaceships but is actually controlling real spaceships. Card expanded the story into [[Ender's Game|a novel with the same title]] and told the backstory of the adult Ender in ''[[Speaker for the Dead]]''. In contrast to the fast-paced ''Ender's Game'', ''Speaker for the Dead'' is about honesty and maturity.{{sfn|Westfahl|1998|p=182–183}} ''Ender's Game'' and ''Speaker for the Dead'' were both awarded the [[Hugo Award]] and the [[Nebula Award]], making Card the first author to win both of science fiction's top prizes in consecutive years.<ref>{{cite web |title=Winner of the Hugo and Nebula Awards |url=https://nebulas.sfwa.org/status/winner/page/14/ |website=Nebula Awards |publisher=Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America |access-date=26 September 2019}}</ref><ref name=CluteSF>{{cite book |last1=Clute |first1=John |editor1-last=Clute |editor1-first=John |editor2-last=Langford |editor2-first=David |editor3-last=Nicholls |editor3-first=Peter |editor4-last=Sleight |editor4-first=Graham |title=Encyclopedia of Science Fiction |publisher=SFE |edition=3rd |url=http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/card_orson_scott |chapter=Card, Orson Scott}}</ref> According to Card, some members of the [[Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America]] (SFWA) resented his receiving of the Nebula award while editing the ''Nebula Awards Report''. Subsequently, Card left the SFWA.{{sfn|Willett|2006|p=96}} Card attended many science fiction conventions in the late 1980s. He held several "Secular Humanist Revival Meetings" at the conventions, satirizing Evangelical revival meetings.<ref>{{cite web |title=Program Information - Bobs Slacktime Funhouse: BSTF 917 - Orson Scott Card's Secular Humanist Revival Meeting |url=http://www.radio4all.net/index.php/program/60671 |website=www.radio4all.net}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Card |first1=Orson Scott |title=The secular, humanist revival meeting |url=https://search.lib.byu.edu/byu/record/cat.2628512.with.31197217122594?holding=csnmvi1574eb8q7d |website=search.lib.byu.edu}}</ref><ref name=locus/>

Card continued to write short stories and columns and published two short story collections: ''[[Cardography]]'' (1987) and ''[[The Folk of the Fringe]]'' (1989).

Inspired by Spenser's [[The Faerie Queene|''Faerie Queene'']], Card composed the long poem ''[[Prentice Alvin and the No-Good Plow]]'', which uses colloquial language and diction common to Joseph Smith's time. The poem, along with the novelette "Hatrack River,"{{sfn|Oziewicz|2008|p=209}} became the basis for ''[[Seventh Son (novel)|Seventh Son]]'' (1987), the first book in [[The Tales of Alvin Maker]] series, a fantasy retelling of the [[Joseph Smith]] story. In the alternate history novel, Alvin Maker, the seventh son of a seventh son, is born with unusual magical abilities that make him a "Maker." Alvin has many similarities to Joseph Smith. Following ''Seventh Son'', he wrote ''[[Red Prophet]]'', and ''[[Prentice Alvin]]'', which focus on settlers' interactions with indigenous peoples and slaves, respectively.{{sfn|Collings|2001|pp=15–16}}{{sfn|Collings|2014|p=32}}{{sfn|England|1990|p=57}} The series has sustainable environmental ethics as a main theme, addressing ways humans affect the environment in the Americas.{{sfn|Oziewicz|2008|p=209}} Alvin Maker's life has many parallels with Joseph Smith's.

=== Works from the 1990s ===
Card wrote prolifically in the 1990s, including many books and the short story omnibus ''[[Maps in a Mirror]]'' (1990). Card continued the Ender's Game series with ''[[Xenocide]]'' (1991) and ''[[Children of the Mind]]'' (1996), which focus on Jane, an artificial intelligence that develops self-awareness. These books were considered inferior to their predecessors and were, according to science fiction critic [[Gary Westfahl]], "overly prolonged".{{sfn|Westfahl|1998|p=183–184}}<ref name="CluteSF"/>

While ''Children of the Mind'' concluded the initial Ender's Game series, Card started another series of books and continued writing in The Tales of Alvin Maker series. The ''[[Homecoming Saga]]'' is a science-fiction adaptation of ''The Book of Mormon''.{{sfn|England|1994|p=59}} The series' volumes; ''[[The Memory of Earth]]'', ''[[The Call of Earth]]'', ''[[The Ships of Earth]]'', ''[[Earthfall (novel)|Earthfall]]'', and ''[[Earthborn]]'' were published between 1992 and 1995.{{sfn|Collings|2001|pp=16–17}} ''[[Alvin Journeyman]]'' (1995), the fourth book in The Tales of Alvin Maker series, won a Locus Award and ''Heartfire'' (1998) was a nominee for the same award.<ref>{{Cite web|title=1996 Award Winners & Nominees|url=https://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_year_index.asp?Year=1996|access-date=2020-10-20|website=Worlds Without End|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=1999 Awards Winners & Nominees|url=https://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_year_index.asp?year=1999|website=Worlds Without End}}</ref>

==Influences and style==
===Influences===
During his childhood, Card read widely. He read children's classics and popular novels.{{sfn|Willett|2006|p=19–21}} His favorite book was Mark Twain's ''[[The Prince and the Pauper]]'' and he read his family's [[World Book Encyclopedia]] in its entirety. He read science fiction stories in anthologies and science fiction novels.{{sfn|Tyson|2003|p=xv}}{{sfn|Willett|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Lupoff|1991|p=121}} He especially credits ''[[Tunesmith]]'' by [[Lloyd Biggle Jr]]. as having a large effect on his life.{{sfn|Tyson|2003|p=xv}}  Card often refers to works by [[Robert A. Heinlein]] and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] as sources of inspiration.{{sfn|Collings|2014|p=31}} Card credits [[C. S. Lewis|C. S. Lewis's]] apologetic fiction in the ''[[C. S. Lewis|Chronicles of Narnia]]'' and [[The Screwtape Letters]]<ref>{{Citation|title=Drinkin' Bros Podcast #617 - Ender’s Game Series Author Orson Scott Card|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QNFNWK4flg|language=en|access-date=2021-11-14}}</ref>{{Rp|location=1:17:50}} as influences that shaped his life and career.{{sfn|Collings|2014|p=24}} In 2014, Card stated that Isaac Asimov and Ray Bradbury were conscious influences on his writing, along with [[Elizabethan English|Early Modern English]] from the [[King James Version]] of the Bible and the works of [[Shakespeare|William Shakespeare]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Card |first1=Orson Scott |title=A Brief Interview with Orson Scott Card (extended answers) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkDZuzYg5q4 |publisher=Tor |access-date=20 November 2020 |page=2:45 |date=Summer 2013}}</ref> As a college student, Card read classic literature, science fiction, and fantasy.{{sfn|Collings|2014|p=31}} Spenser's poetry inspired the original ''[[Prentice Alvin and the No-Good Plow]]''.{{sfn|Collings|2014|p=32}}{{sfn|Samuelson|1996|p=912}} Influences from Portuguese and Brazilian Catholicism, which Card learned about during his LDS mission to Brazil, are evident in his ''Shadow'' and ''Speaker'' novels.{{sfn|Tyson|2003|p=xvii}} Card stated his writing improved after teaching writing workshops with Jay Wentworth and from [[Algis Budrys]]'s workshops at [[Writers of the Future]].<ref name=SVU/>

Card's membership of the LDS Church has been an important influence on his writing, though he initially tried to keep his religious beliefs separate from his fiction.{{sfn|Willett|2006|pp=12–15; 95}}{{sfn|Collings|2014|p=18}} Susanne Reid, a science fiction scholar,<ref>{{cite web |title=Reid, Suzanne Elizabeth 1944- {{!}} Encyclopedia.com |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/educational-magazines/reid-suzanne-elizabeth-1944 |website=www.encyclopedia.com}}</ref> stated Card's religious background is evident in his frequent messiah protagonists and the "moral seriousness" in his works.{{sfn|Collings|2014|p=38}}{{sfn|Reid|1998|p=50; 37}} Card's science-fiction books do not reference the LDS religion directly but "offer careful readers insights that are compelling and moving in their religious intensity".{{sfn|Collings|2014|pp=55–57}} Non-LDS readers of ''A Planet Called Treason'' did not remark on religious themes, however, LDS reviewer Sandy Straubhaar disliked the novel's explicit violence and sex, and stated LDS connections were "gratuitous".{{sfn|Collings|2014|pp=55–57}} Dick Butler criticized ''A Planet Called Treason'' for its lack of Gospel themes and ideas, and two other LDS reviewers defended Card.{{sfn|Collings|2014|pp=57–58}} According to Michael Collings, a critic who acknowledges his "unabashed appreciation" of Card,{{sfn|Collings|2001|p=11}} knowledge of Mormon theology is vital to completely understanding Card's works, stating the life stages of the "piggies" in ''Speaker for the Dead'' correspond to phases of life in the LDS's [[Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)|plan of salvation]].{{sfn|Collings|2014|pp=67; 69}}In an article in ''Sunstone'', Christopher C. Smith also noticed this parallel, noting that the "piggies" procreate "more or less eternally" in the last stage of their development.{{sfn|Smith|2011|p=54}} ''Ender's Game'' and ''Speaker for the Dead'' deal with religious themes common in LDS theology but without many surface references to the religion.{{sfn|Collings|2014|p=72}} The Alvin Maker series does not try to explain Mormon history but uses it to examine his characters' relationships with God.{{sfn|Collings|2014|p=85}}  Card stated that his church membership influences his [[communitarian]] values, specifically, making personal sacrifices for the good of a community. Individuals making sacrifices for their community is a theme in his work.<ref name=lib/>

Card's ''Homecoming Saga'' is a dramatization of [[Book of Mormon]].Eugene England called the first five novels "good literature". Card received criticism from members of the LDS church for "plagiarizing" the Book of Mormon and using it irreverently. He defended his choices and said speculative fiction is the genre best suited to exploring theological and moral issues.{{sfn|England|1994|pp=59–61}} Also in the ''Homecoming Saga'', Card imagines backstories and explanations for "anomalies" in the ''Book of Mormon'', making the fictional work function as a work of [[Mormon_studies#Apologetics|Mormon apologetics]].{{sfn|Smith|2011|pp=54-56}} While women are not prominent in the Book of Mormon, Card makes them prominent in his retelling.{{sfn|England|1994|pp=70–71}} One non-LDS critic described the saga as "readable" but lacking in new ideas.{{sfn|Westfahl|1998|p=185}} Unaware of its relation to the Book of Mormon, another critic said it is similar to the Bible.{{sfn|Reid|1998|p=50}}

===Style===
Because Card began his writing career in screenplays, his early work is considered accessible and fast-paced with good characters, but also stylistically unremarkable. According to biographer Richard Bleiler, a number of critics described his tone as emotionless or conversely, as nonjudgmental, leaving readers to come to their own conclusions about how to feel about a story.{{sfn|Bleiler|1989|p=134–135}} Though Card was initially classified as a [[hard science fiction]] writer for publishing in [[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|''Analog'']],{{sfn|Westfahl|2005|p=197}} his science fiction focuses more on his characters than on the details of future technology.{{sfn|Bleiler|1989|p=134–135}} One critic said Card is poor at characterization, stating the characters Peter and Valentine in ''Ender's Game'' are "totally unbelievable".{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=130}} While noticing that some of Card's early stories were formulaic, Westfahl praised many of Card's early stories as showing "conspicuous originality".{{sfn|Westfahl|1998|pp=181–182}} The graphic violence in his early fiction was controversial; frequent appearances of naked men and boys raised "questions about homoerotic imagery" according to Westfahl.{{sfn|Westfahl|1998|p=179}} Collings stated that the early stories are "essential steps in the development of Card's fiction".{{sfn|Collings|2014|pp=22–23}} Card uses a technique common in [[Pulp magazine|pulp fiction]] when he refers to characters by a quirk of their appearance or personality.<ref name=CluteSF/> Card's fantasy stories also use tropes that are common to fantasy.{{sfn|Tyson|2003|pp=160–161}}

Card cites the Book of Mormon as an important influence on his writing; his habit of beginning sentences with [[Conjunction (grammar)|conjunction]]s comes from the book.{{sfn|Willett|2006|p=22}} Literary devices in ''Hot Sleep'' parallel those of the Book of Mormon.{{sfn|Collings|2014|pp=61–63}} Collings said ''Hot Sleep''{{'s}} mimicry of Book of Mormon language makes it an "inherently" Mormon novel. Card combined several Worthing stories and revised ''Hot Sleep'' to create ''The Worthing Chronicle'', which does not mirror the language of the Book of Mormon as much as ''Hot Sleep'' does.{{sfn|Collings|2014|pp=64; 67}}

==Themes==
===Child-genius savior===
One theme in Card's works is that of a precocious child who is isolated from others but is uniquely positioned to help or save their community. These characters with exceptional abilities achieve their destiny "through discipline and suffering".{{sfn|Beswick|1989|p=52}} Often, his gifted protagonists are introspective children.{{sfn|Lupoff|1991|pp=120–121}} Card's work features children and adults working together, which is unusual.{{sfn|Westfahl|1998|p=179}} His characters feel "real" and must grow and take on responsibilities, and often sacrifice themselves to improve their own societies.{{sfn|Bleiler|1989|p=134–135}} This sacrifice is a difficult choice in which none of the options are obviously good.{{sfn|Tyson|2003|p=157}}  These protagonists have unusual abilities that are both a blessing and a curse. The protagonists, who are isolated from family and friends, relate better to adults than to other young people; when they grow up, they often mentor other precocious youths.{{sfn|Tyson|2003|p=158}}{{sfn|Collings|2014|p=15}} Alvin Maker follows this pattern; his magical abilities are very unusual and he uses them to redeem his people.{{sfn|Samuelson|1996|p=912}}

According to Collings, Card's protagonists are "lonely and manipulative Messiah-figures" who make sacrifices that can be interpreted as a declaration of principles. Family and community problems arise when individuals are not fully accepted or when communities do not work with others in larger units.{{sfn|Collings|2014|p=94}}<ref name=CluteSF/> Often one group tries to kill or enslave another group but their conflict is alleviated when they try to understand each other.{{sfn|Tyson|2003|pp=159–160}} Protagonists make choices that save a person or a group of people.{{sfn|Tyson|2003|p=157}} In ''The Porcelain Salamander'', a girl is saved by a magical salamander; this action restores her ability to move but she takes on some attributes of the salamander.{{sfn|Collings|2014|p=95–96}} In ''Kingsmeat'' the Shepherd painlessly excises meat from humans to save them from being completely eaten by their alien overlords. The violence of removing parts of people is like the violence of repentance.{{sfn|Collings|2014|p=96–98}} Collings states part of this story "could serve as an epigram of all Card's fictions; trapped within a circle of opposing forces, one focal character must decide whether or not to become, like Ender Wiggin, 'something of a savior, or a prophet, or at least a martyr'{{sp}}."{{sfn|Collings|2014|p=36}}

The original short story ''Ender's Game'' is reminiscent of Heinlein's young adult novels because it is about a young person with impressive gifts who is guided by a stern mentor whose choices affect all of humanity.{{sfn|Westfahl|1998|pp=181–182}} The situations and choices in the ''Ender'' series invoke a number of philosophical topics, including the rules of war, [[embodiment psychology]], the ethics of anthropology and [[xenology]], and the morality of manipulating children.{{sfn|WittkowerRush|2013|p=35; 48; 65; 112}} Though Card described ''Happy Head'' (1978) as an embarrassment, it anticipated [[cyberpunk]] fiction with an investigator judge who can experience memories with witnesses. Both ''A Thousand Deaths'' (1978) and ''Unaccompanied Sonata'' feature protagonists who rebel against the dystopias they inhabit.{{sfn|Westfahl|1998|p=180}}

In a May 2013 essay called "Unlikely Events", which Card presented as an experiment in fiction-writing,<ref>{{cite web|last=Card|first=Orson Scott|date=May 9, 2013| url = http://www.ornery.org/essays/warwatch/2013-05-09-1.html | title=Unlikely Events|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608080112/http://www.ornery.org/essays/warwatch/2013-05-09-1.html|url-status=dead | archive-date=June 8, 2013 | access-date=November 2, 2016|publisher=[[Ornery.org|The Ornery American]]}}</ref> Card described an alternative future in which President [[Barack Obama]] ruled as a "[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]- or [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]-style dictator" with his own national police force of young unemployed men; Obama and his wife [[Michelle Obama|Michelle]] would have amended the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]] to allow presidents to remain in power for life, as in [[Nigeria]], [[Zimbabwe]], and [[Nazi Germany]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Child|first=Ben|title=Ender's Game author Orson Scott Card compares Obama to Hitler|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/16/ender-s-game-orson-scott-card-essay-obama-hitler|newspaper=The Guardian|date=August 16, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Horn|first=John|title='Ender's Game' author compares Obama to Hitler|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-enders-game-orson-card-obama-hitler-20130815,0,7348229.story|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=August 15, 2013}}</ref> In the essay, first published in ''The Rhinocerous Times'', Card attributed Obama's success to being a "black man who talks like a white man (that's what they mean by calling him "articulate" and a "great speaker")."<ref name=rhino>{{cite news |last1=Card |first1=Orson Scott |title=Civilization Watch: Unlikely Events |url=https://issuu.com/rhinotimes/docs/rhino5_16_13 |access-date=14 December 2020 |work=The Rhinoceros Times |date=16 May 2013}}</ref>{{rp|66}} The essay drew criticism from journalists for its allusions to Obama's race and its reference to "urban gangs".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.patheos.com/blogs/unreasonablefaith/2013/08/orson-scott-cards-alternate-future/|publisher = [[Patheos.com|Patheos]]|title = Orson Scott Card's Alternate Future|date = August 16, 2013|first = Daniel|last = Florien}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher = [[The American Prospect]]|title = Morally Compromised Art, on the Big Screen: How do we judge a movie made from a book written by someone with repellent political views?|first = Paul|last = Waldman|date = August 16, 2013|url = http://prospect.org/article/morally-compromised-art-big-screen}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.journalnow.com/news/state_region/controversial-author-orson-scott-card-named-to-unc-tv-board/article_3104bc04-199d-11e3-9679-0019bb30f31a.html|date = September 9, 2013|title = Controversial author Orson Scott Card named to UNC-TV board|agency = [[Associated Press]]|newspaper = [[Winston-Salem Journal]]}}</ref> Vice author [[Dave Schilling]] featured the article in his "This Week in Racism" roundup several months after its publication.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Schilling |first1=Dave |title=Orson Scott Card Is Officially the Most Racist Sci-Fi Author |url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/znwb4j/orson-scott-card-is-officially-the-most-racist-sci-fi-author |website=www.vice.com |language=en |date=16 August 2013}}</ref>

''Empire'' (2006) is a novel about civil war between progressive and conservative extremists in America.

===Homosexuality===
In Card's fiction writing, homosexual characters appear in contexts that some critics have interpreted as homophobic. Writing for ''Salon'', Aja Romano lists the "homophobic subtext"<ref name="Romano" /> of characters in four of Card's books. In ''Songmaster'', a man falls in love with a 15-year-old castrato in a [[Pederasty|pederastic]] society. Their sexual union has "creepy overtones" that makes the teenager "unable to have sex again."<ref name="Romano">{{cite web |last1=Romano |first1=Aja |title=Orson Scott Card's long history of homophobia |url=https://www.salon.com/2013/05/07/sci_fi_icon_orson_scott_card_hates_fan_fiction_the_homosexual_agenda_partner/ |website=Salon |access-date=9 November 2020 |language=en |date=8 May 2013}}</ref> On the topic of ''Songmaster'', Card wrote that he was not trying to show homosexual sex as beautiful. Romano wrote that the book's "main plot point revolve[d] around punishing homosexual sex."<ref name="Romano" /> In the Homecoming series, a gay male character, Zdorab, marries and procreates for the good of society. Romano notes that Zdorab does not stop being gay after his marriage, but that procreation is paramount in the book's society.  Eugene England defends Zdorab, arguing that he is a sympathetic character who discovered that his homosexuality was determined by his mother's hormone levels during pregnancy. Therefore, Card acknowledges that homosexuality is not a character trait that can be erased or reversed. While Zdorab marries and has children, he sees his choice to become a father as very deliberate and not "out of some inborn instinct."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=England |first1=Eugene |journal=Sunstone |date=1994 |title=Dawning of a Brighter Day |url=http://associationmormonletters.org/blog/2013/02/orson-scott-card-and-homosexuality/ | ref=none}}</ref><!--Sunstone page is down, so I've linked to the AML page that quotes his article-->

Card also questioned in a 2004 column the notion that homosexuality was a purely [[Biology and sexual orientation|innate or genetic trait]], and asserted that a range of environmental factors also contributed to its development, including abuse.<ref name=OrneryAmerican>{{cite web|url=http://www.ornery.org/essays/warwatch/2004-02-15-1.html|title=Homosexual "Marriage" and Civilization|last1=Card|first1=Orson Scott|website=The Ornery American|access-date=16 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040224175005/http://www.ornery.org/essays/warwatch/2004-02-15-1.html |archive-date=2004-02-24}}</ref> In an introduction to a reprint of his essay, Card wrote that since 2003, when the US [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] had [[Lawrence v.

Card has stated there is no need to legalize same-sex marriage.<ref name=OrneryAmerican/> In a 2008 opinion piece in the ''[[Deseret News]]'' he wrote that relationships between same-sex couples would always be different from those between opposite-sex couples.<ref name=":2">{{cite news|last1=Card|first1=Orson Scott|date=24 July 2008|title=Orson Scott Card: State job is not to redefine marriage|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700245157/State-job-is-not-to-redefine-marriage.html?pg=all|newspaper=The Deseret News|access-date=16 November 2016}}</ref> In 2012, Card supported [[North Carolina Amendment 1]], a ballot measure to outlaw same-sex marriage in North Carolina, saying the legalization of gay marriage was a slippery slope upon which the political left would make it  "illegal to teach traditional values in the schools".<ref>{{cite news |author=Staff Reports |title=Author: Marriage amendment is about forcing 'anti-religious values' on children |url=https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2012/05/author-marriage-amendment-is-about-forcing-anti-religious-values-on-children/ |access-date=27 January 2020 |work=LGBTQ Nation |date=7 May 2012}}</ref> In 2009, Card joined the board of directors of the [[National Organization for Marriage]], a group that campaigns against same-sex marriage.<ref name="Salon">{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/05/07/sci_fi_icon_orson_scott_card_hates_fan_fiction_the_homosexual_agenda_partner/|author-last=Romano |author-first=Aja |date=7 May 2013|title=Orson Scott Card's long history of homophobia: In honor of the "Ender's Game" trailer release, a look at some of the sci-fi master's most controversial remarks|work = [[Salon.com|Salon]]}}</ref> Card resigned from the board in mid-2013.<ref name="cieply">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/13/business/media/authors-anti-gay-views-fuel-call-for-boycott-of-enders-game.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|title=Author's Views on Gay Marriage Fuel Call for Boycott|last=Cieply|first=Michael|date=12 July 2013|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|author-link=Michael Cieply}}</ref> In July 2013, one week after the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] issued rulings in two cases that were widely interpreted as favoring recognition of same-sex marriages, Card published in ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' a statement saying the same-sex marriage issue is moot because of the Supreme Court's decision on the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA).<ref name="inside_movies">{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/2013/07/08/enders-game-orson-scott-card-statement/|title='Ender's Game' author answers critics: Gay marriage issue is 'moot' |last=Lee |first=Stephan |date=2013-07-08 |publisher=Entertainment Weekly |access-date=2021-11-17}}</ref>
