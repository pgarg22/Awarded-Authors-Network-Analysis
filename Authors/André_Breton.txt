'''André Robert Breton''' ({{IPA-fr|ɑ̃dʁe ʁɔbɛʁ bʁətɔ̃|lang}}; 19 February 1896 – 28 September 1966) was a French writer and poet. He is known best as the co-founder, leader, and principal theorist of [[surrealism]].<ref>[[Lawrence Gowing]], ed., Biographical Encyclopedia of Artists, v.1 (Facts on File, 2005): 84.</ref> His writings include the first ''[[Surrealist Manifesto]]'' (''Manifeste du surréalisme'') of 1924, in which he defined surrealism as "[[Surrealist automatism|pure psychic automatism]]".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=12TuC9IkxKIC&q=psychic |title=Manifestoes of Surrealism |publisher=University of Michigan Press |author=André Breton |year=1969 |page=26|isbn=0472061828 }}</ref>

Along with his role as leader of the surrealist movement he is the author of celebrated books such as ''[[Nadja (novel)|Nadja]]'' and ''L'Amour fou''. Those activities combined with his critical and theoretical work for writing and the plastic arts, made André Breton a major figure in twentieth-century French art and literature. 

==Biography==
André Breton was the only son born to a family of modest means in [[Tinchebray]] ([[Orne]]) in [[Normandy]], France. His father, Louis-Justin Breton, was a policeman and [[atheism|atheistic]], and his mother, Marguerite-Marie-Eugénie Le Gouguès, was a former seamstress. Breton attended medical school, where he developed a particular interest in [[mental illness]].<ref name="André Breton">{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/people/andr%C3%A9-breton-37471 |title=André Breton |website=Biography.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170506064912/http://www.biography.com/people/andr%C3%A9-breton-37471 |archive-date=2017-05-06 |language=en-us |access-date=2020-07-11 |url-status=live }}</ref> His education was interrupted when he was [[Conscription in France#World War I|conscripted for World War I]].<ref name="André Breton"/>

During [[World War I]], he worked in a neurological ward in [[Nantes]], where he met the devotee of [[Alfred Jarry]], [[Jacques Vaché]], whose anti-social attitude and disdain for established artistic tradition influenced Breton considerably.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lCwBWk5LcAMC&q=Vach%C3%A9+que+je+dois+le+plus&pg=PA552|title=Dada, circuit total |publisher=L'AGE D'HOMME |author=Henri Béhar, Catherine Dufour |year=2005 |page=552|isbn=9782825119068 }}</ref> Vaché committed [[suicide]] when aged 24, and his war-time letters to Breton and others were published in a volume entitled ''[[Lettres de guerre]]'' (1919), for which Breton wrote four introductory essays.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.andrebreton.fr/work/56600100013611|title=Lettres de guerre|last=Vaché|first=Jacques|date=1949|others=André Breton|edition=2ème publication}}</ref>

Breton married his first wife, Simone Kahn, on 15 September 1921. The couple relocated to rue Fontaine {{abbr|No.|Number}} 42 in [[Paris]] on 1 January 1922. The apartment on rue Fontaine (in the [[Quartier Pigalle|Pigalle]] district) became home to Breton's collection of more than 5,300 items: modern paintings, drawings, sculptures, photographs, books, art catalogs, journals, manuscripts, and works of popular and Oceanic art. Like his father, he was an atheist.<ref>Reviewing Mark Polizzotti's ''Revolution of the Mind: The Life of André Breton'' Douglas F. Smith called him, "[a] cynical atheist, the poet, critic, and artist harbored an irrepressible streak of romanticism."</ref><ref>"To speak of God, to think of God, is in every respect to show what one is made of.... I have always wagered against God and I regard the little that I have won in this world as simply the outcome of this bet. However paltry may have been the stake (my life) I am conscious of having won to the full. Everything that is doddering, squint-eyed, vile, polluted and grotesque is summoned up for me in that one word: God!" - André Breton, taking from a footnote from his book, ''Surrealism and Painting''.

===From Dada to Surrealism===
Breton launched the review ''[[Littérature]]'' in 1919, with [[Louis Aragon]] and [[Philippe Soupault]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.citylights.com/book/?GCOI=87286100571740|title=Lost Profiles, Memoirs of Cubism, Dada, and Surrealism|website=www.citylights.com|language=EN|access-date=2019-06-11}}</ref> He also associated with [[Dada]]ist [[Tristan Tzara]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theartstory.org/artist-tzara-tristan.htm|title=Tristan Tzara Art, Bio, Ideas|website=The Art Story|access-date=2019-06-11}}</ref> In 1924, he was instrumental in the founding of the [[Bureau of Surrealist Research]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://faqonespionage.wordpress.com/2012/07/24/bureau-of-surrealist-research/|title=Bureau of Surrealist Research|last=ramalhodiogo|date=2012-07-24|website=Frequently Asked Questions|language=en|access-date=2019-06-11}}</ref>

In ''[[Les Champs Magnétiques]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.andrebreton.fr/en/work/56600100772781|title=Les Champs magnétiques (André Breton)|website=www.andrebreton.fr|language=fr}}</ref> (''The Magnetic Fields''), a collaboration with Soupault, he implemented the principle of [[Surrealist automatism|automatic writing]]. He published the ''[[Surrealist Manifesto]]'' in 1924, and was editor of the magazine ''[[La Révolution surréaliste]]'' from that year on. A group of writers became associated with him: Soupault, [[Louis Aragon]], [[Paul Éluard]], [[René Crevel]], [[Michel Leiris]], [[Benjamin Péret]], [[Antonin Artaud]], and [[Robert Desnos]].

Anxious to combine the themes of personal transformation found in the works of [[Arthur Rimbaud]] with the politics of [[Karl Marx]], Breton joined the [[French Communist Party]] in 1927, from which he was expelled in 1933. ''[[Nadja (novel)|Nadja]]'', a novel about his encounter with an imaginative woman who later became mentally ill, was published in 1928. Breton celebrated the concept of Mad Love, and many women joined the surrealist group over the years. [[Toyen]] was a good friend. During this time, he survived mostly by the sale of paintings from his art gallery.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=Revolution of the mind : the life of André Breton|last=Polizzotti, Mark.|date=2009|publisher=Black Widow Press|isbn=9780979513787|edition=1st Black Widow Press ed., rev. & updated|location=Boston, Mass.|oclc=221148942}}</ref><ref name=":0" />

In 1930, ''[[Un Cadavre]]'', a pamphlet, was written and released by several members of the surrealist movement who were insulted by Breton or had otherwise disbelieved in his leadership.<ref name="MP2009">{{cite book |last=Polizzotti |first=Mark |title= Revolution of the Mind |date=2009 |edition=Revised and updated |orig-year=First published 1995 |publisher=First Black Widow Press |location=Boston, MA |isbn=978-0-9795137-8-7}}</ref>{{rp|299–302}} The pamphlet criticized Breton's oversight and influence over the movement. It marked a divide amidst the early surrealists.

In 1935, there was a conflict between Breton and the [[Soviet]] writer and journalist [[Ilya Ehrenburg]] during the first International Congress of Writers for the Defense of Culture, which opened in Paris in June. Breton had been insulted by Ehrenburg—along with all fellow surrealists—in a pamphlet which said, among other things, that surrealists were "[[pederast]]s". Breton slapped Ehrenburg several times on the street, which resulted in surrealists being expelled from the Congress. René Crevel, who according to [[Salvador Dalí]] was "the only serious [[communist]] among surrealists",<ref name="Afterword">{{cite book|title=Le Clavecin de Diderot, Afterword|last=Crevel|first=René|pages=161}}</ref> was isolated from Breton and other surrealists, who were unhappy with Crevel because of his [[bisexuality]] and annoyed with communists in general.<ref name=":1" />

In 1938, Breton accepted a cultural commission from the French government to travel to [[Mexico]]. After a conference at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] about surrealism, Breton stated after getting lost in [[Mexico City]] (as no one was waiting for him at the airport) "I don't know why I came here. Mexico is the most surrealist country in the world".

However, visiting Mexico provided the opportunity to meet [[Leon Trotsky]]. Breton and other surrealists traveled via a long boat ride from Patzcuaro to the town of [[Erongarícuaro]]. [[Diego Rivera]] and [[Frida Kahlo]] were among the visitors to the hidden community of intellectuals and artists. Together, Breton and Trotsky wrote the ''[[Manifesto for an Independent Revolutionary Art]]'' (published under the names of Breton and Diego Rivera) calling for "complete freedom of art", which was becoming increasingly difficult with the world situation of the time.

===World War II and exile===
Breton was again in the medical corps of the [[French Army]] at the start of [[World War II]]. The [[Vichy France|Vichy]] government banned his writings as "the very negation of the [[Révolution nationale|national revolution]]"<ref name="rosemont">Franklin Rosemont ''André Breton and the First Principles of Surrealism'', 1978, {{ISBN|0-904383-89-X}}.</ref> and Breton escaped, with the help of the American [[Varian Fry]] and [[Hiram Bingham IV|Hiram "Harry" Bingham IV]], to the [[United States]] and the [[Caribbean]] during 1941.<ref>{{cite news |last=Schiffrin |first=Anya |date=2019-10-03 |title=How Varian Fry Helped My Family Escape the Nazis |url=https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2019/10/03/how-varian-fry-helped-my-family-escape-the-nazis/ |work=[[The New York Review of Books|NYR Daily]] |access-date=2020-07-11 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://exhibitions.ushmm.org/americans-and-the-holocaust/personal-story/varian-fry |title=Emergency Escape: Vatican Fry |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=<!--Not stated--> |website=Americans and the Holocaust |publisher=[[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] |access-date=2020-07-11 }}</ref> He emigrated to [[New York City]] and lived there for a few years.<ref name="André Breton"/> In 1942, Breton organized a groundbreaking surrealist exhibition at [[Yale University]].<ref name="André Breton"/>

In 1942,<ref>André Breton, ''Fata Morgana''. Buenos Aires: Éditions des lettres françaises, Sur, 1942.</ref> Breton collaborated with artist [[Wifredo Lam]] on the publication of Breton's poem "Fata Morgana", which was illustrated by Lam.

Breton got to know [[Martinique|Martinican]] writer [[Aimé Césaire]], and later composed the introduction to the 1947 edition of Césaire's ''[[Cahier d'un retour au pays natal]]''. During his exile in New York City he met [[Elisa Breton|Elisa Bindhoff]], the [[Chile]]an woman who would become his third wife.<ref name=":1" />

In 1944, he and Elisa traveled to the [[Gaspé Peninsula]] in [[Quebec|Québec]], where he wrote ''Arcane 17'', a book which expresses his fears of World War II, describes the marvels of the [[Percé Rock]] and the extreme northeastern part of North America, and celebrates his new romance with Elisa.<ref name=":1" />

During his visit to [[Haiti]] in 1945–46, he sought to connect surrealist politics and [[Automatism (law)|automatist]] practices with the legacies of the [[Haitian Revolution]] and the ritual practices of [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]] possession. Recent developments in Haitian painting were central to his efforts, as can be seen from a comment that Breton left in the visitors' book at the [[Centre d'Art]] in [[Port-au-Prince]]: "Haitian painting will drink the blood of the phoenix. And, with the epaulets of [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines|[Jean-Jacques] Dessalines]], it will ventilate the world." Breton was specifically referring to the work of painter and Vodou priest [[Hector Hyppolite]], whom he identified as the first artist to directly depict Vodou scenes and the lwa (Vodou deities), as opposed to hiding them in [[chromolithography|chromolithographs]] of Catholic saints or invoking them through impermanent vevé (abstracted forms drawn with powder during rituals). Breton's writings on Hyppolite were undeniably central to the artist's international status from the late 1940s on, but the surrealist readily admitted that his understanding of Hyppolite's art was inhibited by their lack of a common language. Returning to France with multiple paintings by Hyppolite, Breton integrated this artwork into the increased surrealist focus on the occult, myth, and magic.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Geis |first=T. |date=2015 |title=Myth, History and Repetition: André Breton and Vodou in Haiti |journal=South Central Review |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages= 56–75|doi=10.1353/scr.2015.0010 |s2cid=143481322 }}</ref>

===Later life===
[[File:AndreBreton.jpg|thumb|150px|Breton in the 1960s]]
Breton returned to Paris in 1946, where he opposed [[French colonialism]] (for example as a signatory of the ''[[Manifesto of the 121]]'' against the [[Algerian War]]) and continued, until his death, to foster a second group of surrealists in the form of expositions or reviews (''[[La Brèche]]'', 1961–65). In 1959, he organized an exhibit in Paris.<ref name=":1" />

By the end of World War II, André Breton decided to embrace [[anarchism]] explicitly. In 1952, Breton wrote "It was in the black mirror of anarchism that surrealism first recognised itself."<ref name="anarchosurrealism">{{cite web |url=http://libcom.org/history/1919-1950-the-politics-of-surrealism |title=1919–1950: The politics of Surrealism by Nick Heath |publisher=Libcom.org |access-date=26 December 2009}}</ref> Breton consistently supported the francophone [[Anarchist Federation (France)|Anarchist Federation]] and he continued to offer his solidarity after the [[Platformism|Platformists]] around founder and Secretary General [[Georges Fontenis]] transformed the FA into the Fédération communiste libertaire.<ref name=":1" /><ref name="anarchosurrealism"/>

Like a small number of intellectuals during the time of the Algerian War, he continued to support the FCL when it was forced to go underground, even providing shelter to Fontenis, who was in hiding. He refused to take sides in the politically divided French anarchist movement, even though both he and Péret expressed solidarity to the new Anarchist Federation rebuilt by a group of [[synthesis anarchism|synthesist anarchists]]. He also worked with the FA in the [[French Anti-Fascist Committee|Anti-Fascist Committee]]s in the 1960s.<ref name="anarchosurrealism"/>

==Death==
André Breton died at the age of 70 in 1966, and was buried in the [[Cimetière des Batignolles]] in Paris.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.surrealismart.org/history/andre-breton.html |title=André Breton {{!}} Father of Surrealism |last=Art |first=Surrealism |website=www.surrealismart.org |access-date=2018-01-24}}</ref>

==Legacy==
===Breton as a collector===
Breton was an avid collector of art, [[ethnography|ethnographic]] material, and unusual trinkets. He was particularly interested in materials from the northwest coast of North America. During a [[financial crisis]] he experienced in 1931, most of his collection (along with that of his friend Paul Éluard) was auctioned. He subsequently rebuilt the collection in his studio and home at 42 rue Fontaine. The collection grew to over 5,300 items: modern paintings, drawings, sculptures, photographs, books, art catalogs, journals, manuscripts, and works of popular and Oceanic art.<ref>''André Breton, 42, rue Fontaine: tableaux modernes, sculptures, estampes, tableaux anciens''. Paris: CalmelsCohen, 2003.<!--ISSN/ISBN needed, if any--></ref>

French anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], in an interview in 1971, spoke about Breton's skill in determining the authenticity of objects. Strauss even described their friendship while the two were living in New York: "We lived in New York between 1941 and 1945 in a great friendship, running museums and [[antiquarian]]s together. I owe him a lot about the knowledge and appreciation of objects. I've never seen him [Breton] doing a mistake on exotic and unusual objects. When I say a mistake, I mean about its authenticity but also its quality. He [Breton] had a sense, almost of divination."<ref name=":0">{{cite web |url=http://www.historygraphicdesign.com/industrial-revolution/genesis-of-twentieth-century-design/432-andre-breton |title=André Breton |last=Douglas |first=Ava |website=www.historygraphicdesign.com |language=en-gb |access-date=2019-02-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190212123827/http://www.historygraphicdesign.com/industrial-revolution/genesis-of-twentieth-century-design/432-andre-breton |archive-date=2019-02-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref>{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

After Breton's death on 28 September 1966, his third wife, Elisa, and his daughter, Aube, allowed students and researchers access to his archive and collection. After thirty-six years, when attempts to establish a surrealist foundation to protect the collection were opposed, the collection was auctioned by Calmels Cohen at Drouot-Richelieu. A wall of the apartment is preserved at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]].<ref>"Surrealist Art", Centre Pompidou - Art Culture Mus. 11 March 2010.

Nine previously unpublished manuscripts, including the ''Manifeste du surréalisme'', were auctioned by [[Sotheby's]] in May 2008.<ref name="ArtDaily">{{cite news |url=http://www.artdaily.org/index.asp?int_sec=2&int_new=23096 |title=Nine Manuscripts by André Breton at Sotheby's Paris |date=20 May 2008 |publisher=ArtDaily.org |access-date=28 March 2009}}</ref>
