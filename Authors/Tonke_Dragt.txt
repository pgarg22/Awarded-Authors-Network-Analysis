'''Antonia "Tonke" Johanna Willemina Dragt''' (born 12 November 1930) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] writer and illustrator of children's literature. Her book ''[[De brief voor de Koning]]'' was chosen by [[Collectieve Propaganda van het Nederlandse Boek|CPNB]] as the best Dutch youth book of the latter half of the twentieth century.

==Biography==
===Childhood in Batavia===
Antonia Johanna Willemina Dragt, better known as Tonke Dragt, was born in 1930 in Batavia on the [[Dutch East Indies]] (currently [[Jakarta]] in [[Indonesia]]) as the eldest daughter of a Dutch insurance agent based in Batavia. Dragt was initially called "Tonneke" (Dutch for 'tubby'), a name she disliked "because I was tall and thin".<ref name="Trouw, 30 March 2019">{{cite news |last1=Claus |first1=Sybilla |title='De brief voor de koning' krijgt een Netflix-serie.

The inspiration for several of her early novels such as ''De brief voor de koning'' en ''Geheimen van het Wilde Woud'' were taken from her yearly Summer holidays at [[Puncak]] and [[Mount Gede Pangrango National Park|Situgunung]].<ref name="auto5">{{cite book |last=Terhell; Akveld |first=Annemarie; Joukje |title=ABC Dragt |year=2013  |publisher=Leopold |location=[[Amsterdam]] |language=Dutch |isbn=978-90-258-6114-8 |pages=19}}</ref>

During the [[Second World War]], Dragt, her mother and her two sisters were interned in Japanese prisoner's camp [[Tjideng]]. The situation in the camp was adverse, shortages of food and other essentials were prevalent. As reading had been her biggest hobby, Dragt found herself often bored as there were no novels. To solve this problem, aged 13, she and her friend Tineke decided to write a novel, ''De jacht op de touwkleurige'' (''The  hunt for the rope-coloured'') under the [[pen name]] Tito Drastra. Dragt also provided illustrations for this novel. A second, never completed book, ''De Florentijnse ring'' would be a motive for a part of her debut novel ''De verhalen van de tweelingbroers''.<ref name="auto5"/> Both novels were written on loose sheets of used paper and toilet rolls due to the lack of proper notebooks.<ref name="auto2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.wormerjaya.co.id/de_brief.htm|title=Pena Wormer - Surat untuk Raja|website=www.wormerjaya.co.id}}</ref>

After the liberation, Dragt was reunited with her father and family moved to the Netherlands, where they first came to live in [[Dordrecht]] in 1949 and subsequently moved to [[The Hague]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Dragt |first=Tonke |title=Als de sterren zingen |year=2017  |publisher=Leopold |location=[[Amsterdam]] |language=Dutch |isbn=978-90-258-7374-5 |pages=19}}</ref> Dragt could never return to Indonesia, initially because she lacked money, later because her health would not allow it anymore.<ref name="auto2"/>

===Life in the Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, she completed her [[Hogere Burgerschool|HBS]] exams and subsequently was enrolled at the Academy of Visual Arts in [[The Hague]]. Her dream was to become a full-time artist, but her parents encouraged her to do something which would lead to making enough income to take care of herself.<ref name="Trouw, 30 March 2019" /> As a result, she focused on becoming an art teacher.

Dragt afterwards did most of her writing at night time while working as a drawing teacher at primary schools during the day. She had problems with controlling her classroom as a teacher, as classes were often filled with forty to fifty children due to the [[babyboom]]. She quickly noticed that by telling stories, she could calm her pupils down.<ref name="Trouw, 30 March 2019" /> This experience would lead to the inspiration for Frans van der Steg, the protagonist in her novel ''De zevensprong''.<ref name="auto1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_lit004200101_01/_lit004200101_01_0022.php|title=Literatuur zonder leeftijd. Jaargang 15 · dbnl|website=DBNL}}</ref>

In 1956, her first work was accepted in several magazines and newspapers, most notably the magazine ''Kris Kras''. Five years later, her debut book appeared and was received well by critics.<ref name=Leopold>{{cite web |url=http://www.leopold.nl/web/Schrijver-tekenaar/Auteurpagina.htm?dbid=3068&typeofpage=82337 |title=Tonke Dragt |accessdate=2010-10-16 |publisher=Leopold |language=Dutch}}</ref> She made a big name for herself with her second novel in 1962, ''De brief voor de koning'' (''The Letter for the King''), which won the award for being the best Dutch children's book of the year. She continued to produce at a high rhythm during the 1960s, but massively reduced the output of new work in the next decades, although collections of older short stories filled up many of the gaps.<ref>{{cite book |last=Van Gool |first=Jef |title=Refleks |year=1977 |pages=76}}</ref>

Apart from writing and illustrating her own books, Tonke Dragt also made illustrations for some other books, including work by [[Paul Biegel]], [[E. Nesbit]], [[Rosemary Sutcliff]], and the novel ''[[Elidor]]'' by [[Alan Garner]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Van Gool |first=Jef |title=Refleks |year=1977 |pages=77}}</ref>

Throughout the decade, the work of Tonke Dragt was translated into many languages, including [[German language|German]], [[Afrikaans]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]. It would take until 2013 before her first novel was translated into [[English language|English]].

==Style and themes==
Many of the books and stories by Tonke Dragt are situated in a fantasy or science fiction environment, although usually closely related to or intertwined with the real world.<ref name = Leopold/> ''De brief voor de koning'', ''Geheimen van het Wilde Woud'', and a few short stories, are set in a fictional medieval world. ''Torenhoog en mijlenbreed'', ''Ogen van tijgers'', and related stories, are near-future science fiction stories, where the action happens on [[Venus]] and [[Earth]]. ''De torens van februari'' alternates between our world and a parallel world. ''De zevensprong'' is most firmly set in a realistic setting.

Dragt uses elements of legends and fables, most clearly in ''Verhalen van de tweelingbroers''. Her stories are mainly focused on one or a few male protagonists, often teenagers. They go on a personal quest, a search that may be externalized in an item like the letter in ''De brief voor de koning'', but which results in a discovery of their own persona.<ref name=Leopold/> Dragt admitted that she used male characters as it was more logical in her historic settings, for example the [[Middle Ages]] in ''De brief voor de koning'', in which females played a smaller role. On top of that, she called the traditional "girl books" of her time "slow", preferring to read books aimed at boys.<ref name="Trouw, 30 March 2019" />

Tonke Dragt's style and themes were considered to be unique in Dutch children's literature as up to the 1960s, most Dutch children's literature was set in a day-to-day realistic setting, involving young children. In the 1960s, Dragt, alongside [[Thea Beckman]] started pioneering children's literature with their thick books involving protagonists in historical fantasy and science fiction settings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.trouw.nl/gs-b4b6d26b|title=Schrijfster Tonke Dragt gaat uit van de intelligentie van het kind|first=Jonathan|last=Huseman|date=28 April 2001|website=Trouw}}</ref>

Dragt long admired [[British literature|British children's literature]] for its [[fantasy]] tradition, stating that Dutch literature demanded [[Literary realism|realism]].<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/19/tonke-dragt-interview-i-was-born-a-fairytale-teller-letter-for-the-king|title=Tonke Dragt interview: 'I was born a fairytale teller'|first=Michelle|last=Pauli|date=19 September 2015|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> In a 2019 interview, Dragt therefore recalled her first call with [[Miep Diekmann]], who worked as an editor at Leopold at the time and was not entirely convinced by the first ''Verhalen van de tweelingbroers'' manuscript, stating that fables were out of fashion. Diekmann was also concerned with the thickness of the book, totalling over 350 pages, which was unusual for a children's book at the time. However, she was charmed by the illustrations and storytelling ability, calling Dragt "talented".<ref name="Trouw, 30 March 2019" />

Dragt's first books and their illustrations were mainly inspired by her childhood in [[Jakarta|Batavia]] and the [[Middle Ages]].<ref name="auto1"/> She incorporated settings in her story which were considered exotic by Dutch people, with ''Geheimen van het Wilde Woud'' and ''De brief voor de koning'' partially being set in [[rainforest]]s and on mountains, [[knight]]s with [[chain mail]] armour.<ref name="auto"/> In ''Verhalen van de tweelingbroers'', the main setting of the story, the city Bainoe, strongly resembles Batavia in illustrations, while the illustrated characters in the story wear [[Italy|Italian]] [[Renaissance]] fashion,<ref name="Trouw, 30 March 2019" /> with the  main characters Jiacomo and Laurenzo wearing a [[giornea]] and a cap.

==Success of ''The Letter for the King''==
