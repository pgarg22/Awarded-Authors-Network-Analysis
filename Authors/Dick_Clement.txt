Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais have enjoyed a long and successful career embracing films, television and theatre. Their partnership began in the mid-1960s with ''The Likely Lads'', and by the end of the decade they had also written three feature films: ''[[The Jokers]]'', ''[[Otley]]'', (directed by Clement) and ''[[Hannibal Brooks]]''.  Clement also directed the BBC sketch show ''[[Not Only... But Also]]'', which starred [[Peter Cook]] and [[Dudley Moore]], and, for the big screen, [[Iris Murdoch]]'s ''[[A Severed Head (film)|A Severed Head]]''.

In the early 1970s, two other features were scripted by Clement and La Frenais: ''[[Villain (1971 film)|Villain]]'', starring [[Richard Burton]], and ''[[Catch Me a Spy]]'', starring [[Kirk Douglas]]. In this same period, they created their award-winning series ''Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?'', followed by ''Porridge'', ''''[[Thick as Thieves (TV series)|Thick as Thieves]]'''' and a spin-off from ''Porridge'', ''[[Going Straight]]''.  There were big screen versions of both ''[[The Likely Lads (film)|The Likely Lads]]'' and ''[[Porridge (film)|Porridge]]'', and a '[[rockumentary]]', ''To Russia With Elton'', in 1979.

During the same period, they adapted [[Keith Waterhouse]]'s ''[[Billy Liar]]'' into the stage musical ''[[Billy (musical)|Billy]]'', starring [[Michael Crawford]], which ran at London's [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane Theatre]] for two and a half years. By this time they were living in [[California]], where they wrote the American version of ''Porridge'', ''[[On the Rocks (U.S. TV series)|On the Rocks]]'', and the feature film, ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda (1979 film)|The Prisoner of Zenda]]'', starring [[Peter Sellers]].

In the 1980s, Clement directed [[John Wells (satirist)|John Wells]]'s hit stage play ''[[Anyone for Denis? (video)|Anyone For Denis?]]'' He directed the films ''[[Bullshot (film)|Bullshot]]'' and ''[[Water (1985 film)|Water]]'', which were produced by his writing partner La Frenais; the pair also scripted the latter film, and contributed extensive, uncredited writing work on the unofficial James Bond movie ''[[Never Say Never Again]]''.  In 1987, they wrote and produced ''[[Vice Versa (1988 film)|Vice Versa]]''. Their television work at the time included the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] series ''[[Auf Wiedersehen, Pet]]'', which was voted ITV's Favourite TV Programme of all Time in a ''[[Radio Times]]'' readers' poll in order to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the station.
	
By the beginning of the 1990s, La Frenais had created the long running series, ''Lovejoy'', and co-created ''[[Spender]]'' with [[Jimmy Nail]]. In America, they were writers and supervising producers for [[HBO]]'s [[Emmy Award|Emmy]]-winning show, ''[[Tracey Takes On...]]'', for four years. They scripted the film adaptation of ''[[The Commitments (film)|The Commitments]]'', which won the [[Evening Standard British Film Awards|Evening Standard's Peter Sellers Award for Comedy]] and the [[BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]], and also wrote the screenplays for ''[[Excess Baggage (1997 film)|Excess Baggage]]'' and ''[[Still Crazy]]''.  In addition, they did uncredited rewrites on ''[[The Rock (film)|The Rock]]'', starring Sean Connery, and ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]'' for producers [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] and [[Michael Bay]] (who also directed the film).<ref> BBC 4, Mark Lawson Talks to Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, March 20th 2013, https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mj91/episodes/guide</ref>

In 2005, Clement and La Frenais had two television adaptations of best-selling novels broadcast by the BBC: [[Jonathan Coe]]'s ''[[The Rotters' Club (TV series)|The Rotter's Club]]'' for [[BBC Two]], and [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]]'s [[Archangel (2005 film)|Archangel]], starring [[Daniel Craig]], for [[BBC One]]. That year also saw the UK release of ''[[Goal! (film)|Goal!]]'', a film they co-scripted. In 2006, they were credited as writers on the animated film ''[[Flushed Away]]'', whilst 2007 saw the release of the [[jukebox musical]] ''[[Across the Universe (film)|Across the Universe]]'', based around the songs of [[The Beatles]], which they scripted, and, with director [[Julie Taymor]], wrote the story for. The 2008 film ''[[The Bank Job]]'', starring [[Jason Statham]], is their last screenplay work to date.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

Two new television series written by them aired in 2017: a new version of ''[[Porridge (2016 TV series)|Porridge]]'', starring [[Kevin Bishop]], for the BBC, and ''[[Henry IX (TV series)|Henry IX]]'' for [[UKTV Gold]], starring [[Charles Edwards (English actor)|Charles Edwards]].{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} The duo have also written the book for two stage musicals in development, ''Juke Box Hero'' and ''Victoria's Secret''.
