'''Sir Andrew Motion''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FRSL}} (born 26 October 1952) is an English poet, novelist, and biographer, who was [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]] from 1999 to 2009. During the period of his laureateship, Motion founded the [[Poetry Archive]], an online resource of poems and audio recordings of poets reading their own work. In 2012, he became President of the [[Campaign to Protect Rural England]], taking over from [[Bill Bryson]].

C. Fox-Davies, Hurst & Blackett Ltd, 1929, vol. II, pp. 1400-1401</ref>

The family moved to [[Stisted]], near [[Braintree, Essex|Braintree]] in Essex, when Motion was 12 years old.<ref name=Ramblings/> Motion went to [[boarding school]] from the age of seven<ref name="poetrymatters"/> joined by his younger brother.<ref name=Ramblings/> Most of his friends were from the school and so when Motion was in the village he spent a lot of time on his own.<ref name=Ramblings/> He began to have an interest and affection for the countryside and he went for walks with a pet dog.<ref name=Ramblings/> Later he went to [[Radley College]], where, in the [[sixth form]], he encountered Peter Way, an inspiring English teacher who introduced him to poetry – first [[Thomas Hardy|Hardy]], then [[Philip Larkin]], [[W. H. Auden]], [[Seamus Heaney|Heaney]], [[Ted Hughes|Hughes]], [[Wordsworth]] and [[Keats]].<ref name="poetrymatters"/><ref Name="Profile">[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article4748531.ece "Profile: Andrew Motion, the poet laureate"]. ''The Sunday Times''. 14 September 2008.</ref>

When Motion was 17 years old, his mother had a horse riding accident and suffered a serious head injury requiring a life-saving [[neurosurgery]] operation. She regained some speech, but she was severely paralysed and remained in and out of coma for nine years.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/5056194/Interview-with-Andrew-Motion.html "Interview with Andrew Motion"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 30 March 2009</ref> She died in 1978 and her husband died of cancer in 2006.<ref name=Ramblings>{{cite episode|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01d2qf6 |title =Ramblings: Inspirational Walks: Sir Andrew Motion |series = Ramblings |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] |airdate=2012-03-17}}</ref> Motion has said that he wrote to keep his memory of his mother alive.<ref Name= "AM">[http://www.uktouring.org.uk/andrewmotion/books.htm Andrew Motion Official website] Accessed 12 July 2010</ref> When Motion was about 18 years old he moved away from the village to study English at [[University College, Oxford]];<ref Name= "AM"/> however, since then he has remained in contact with the village to visit the church graveyard, where his parents are buried, and also to see his brother, who lives nearby. At University he studied at weekly sessions with [[W. H. Auden]], whom he greatly admired.<ref Name="Profile"/> Motion won the university's [[Newdigate Prize]] and graduated with a [[British undergraduate degree classification|first class honours degree]].<ref name=Ramblings/> This was followed by an MLitt on the poetry of [[Edward Thomas (poet)|Edward Thomas]].

==Career==
Between 1976 and 1980, Motion taught English at the [[University of Hull]]<ref Name= "AM"/> and while there, at age 24, he had his first volume of poetry published. At Hull he met university librarian and poet [[Philip Larkin]]. Motion was later appointed as one of Larkin's literary executors, which would privilege Motion's role as his biographer following Larkin's death in 1985. In ''Philip Larkin: A Writer's Life'', Motion says that at no time during their nine-year friendship did they discuss writing his biography and it was Larkin's longtime companion [[Relationships that influenced Philip Larkin#Monica Jones|Monica Jones]] who requested it. He reports how, as executor, he rescued many of Larkin's papers from imminent destruction following his friend's death.<ref>Benton, Michael, Benton ''Literary Biography: An Introduction'' Wiley-Blackwell pp&nbsp;192–200 {{ISBN|1-4051-9446-4}}</ref> His 1993 biography of Larkin, which won the [[1994 Whitbread Awards|Whitbread Prize for Biography]], was responsible for bringing about a substantial revision of Larkin's reputation.

Motion was Editorial Director and Poetry Editor at [[Chatto & Windus]] (1983–89), he edited the [[Poetry Society]]'s ''[[Poetry Review]]'' from 1980 to 1982 and succeeded [[Malcolm Bradbury]] as Professor of Creative Writing at the [[University of East Anglia]].<ref Name= "AM"/> He is now on the faculty at the [[Johns Hopkins Writing Seminars]].

===Laureateship===
Motion was appointed Poet Laureate on 1 May 1999, following the death of [[Ted Hughes]], the previous incumbent. The Nobel Prize-winning Northern Irish poet and translator [[Seamus Heaney]] had ruled himself out for the post. Breaking with the tradition of the laureate retaining the post for life, Motion stipulated that he would stay for only ten years. The yearly stipend of £200 was increased to £5,000 and he received the customary [[butt (volume)|butt]] of [[Sack (wine)|sack]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.poetrysociety.org.uk/content/duffy09/poetlaureate/ | title=Carol Ann Duffy was officially declared as Britain's first female Poet Laureate on May&nbsp;1st 2009. | access-date=21 May 2009 | publisher=The Poetry Society | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510115038/http://www.poetrysociety.org.uk/content/duffy09/poetlaureate/ | archive-date=10 May 2009 | url-status=dead}}</ref>
He wanted to write "poems about things in the news, and commissions from people or organisations involved with ordinary life," rather than be seen a 'courtier'. So, he wrote "for the [[Trades Union Congress|TUC]] about liberty, about homelessness for [[the Salvation Army]], about bullying for [[ChildLine]], about the [[2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak|foot and mouth outbreak]] for the [[Today (BBC Radio 4)|''Today'' programme]], about the [[Ladbroke Grove rail crash|Paddington rail disaster]], the [[11 September attacks]] and [[Harry Patch]] for the BBC, and more recently about [[Combat stress reaction|shell shock]] for the charity [[Combat Stress]], and climate change for the song cycle he finished for Cambridge University with [[Peter Maxwell Davies]]."<ref name="Lau rels" />

On 14 March 2002, as part of the 'Re-weaving Rainbows' event of [[National Science Week]] 2002, Motion unveiled a blue plaque on the front wall of 28 St Thomas Street, [[Southwark]], to commemorate the sharing of lodgings there by [[John Keats]] and [[Henry Stephens (doctor)|Henry Stephens]] while they were medical students at [[Guy's Hospital|Guy's]] and [[St Thomas' Hospital]] in 1815–16.

In 2003, Motion wrote ''Regime change'', a poem in protest at the [[Invasion of Iraq]] from the point of view of Death walking the streets during the conflict,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/2912557.stm|title=BBC News: "Poet laureate writes Iraq lament"|date=3 April 2003|access-date=12 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.rice.edu/~ssiyer/minstrels/poems/1215.html |title=Regime Change |access-date=12 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015005834/http://www.cs.rice.edu/~ssiyer/minstrels/poems/1215.html |archive-date=15 October 2009 }}</ref> and in 2005, ''Spring Wedding'' in honour of the wedding of the [[Prince of Wales]] to [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall|Camilla Parker Bowles]]. Commissioned to write in the honour of 109-year-old [[Harry Patch]], the last surviving "[[Tommy Atkins|Tommy]]" to have fought in [[World War I]], Motion composed a five-part poem, read and received by Patch at the [[Bishop's Palace, Wells|Bishop's Palace in Wells]] in 2008.<ref>{{cite news|title=Poem honours WWI veteran aged 109|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/7279861.stm|work=BBC News Online|date=7 March 2008|access-date=7 March 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080311005302/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/7279861.stm| archive-date= 11 March 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>

As laureate, he also founded the [[Poetry Archive]], an on-line library of historic and contemporary recordings of poets reciting their own work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryarchive.org/poetryarchive/home.do|title=The Poetry Archive|access-date=12 October 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519101308/http://www.poetryarchive.org/poetryarchive/home.do|archive-date=19 May 2014}}</ref>

Motion remarked that he found some of the duties attendant to the post of poet laureate difficult and onerous and that the appointment had been "very, very damaging to [his] work".<ref>{{cite news|title= Laureate bemoans 'thankless' job|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7607897.stm|work=BBC News Online|date=10 September 2008|access-date=10 September 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080910173623/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7607897.stm| archive-date= 10 September 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> The appointment of Motion met with criticism from some quarters.<ref>{{cite news|title=Andrew Motion to be Poet Laureate|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/may/19/fiachragibbons.michaelwhite|work=The Guardian |date=19 May 1999|access-date=10 September 2008 | location=London | first=Michael | last=White}}</ref> As he prepared to stand down from the job, Motion published an article in ''[[The Guardian]]'' that concluded, "To have had 10 years working as laureate has been remarkable. Sometimes it's been remarkably difficult, the laureate has to take a lot of flak, one way or another. More often it has been remarkably fulfilling. I'm glad I did it, and I'm glad I'm giving it up – especially since I mean to continue working for poetry."

Motion spent his last day as Poet Laureate holding a creative writing class at his alma mater, [[Radley College]], before giving a poetry reading and thanking Peter Way, the man who taught him English at Radley, for making him who he was. [[Carol Ann Duffy]] succeeded him as Poet Laureate on 1 May 2009.
