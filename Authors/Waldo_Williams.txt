'''Waldo Goronwy Williams''' (30 September 1904 – 20 May 1971) was one of the leading [[Welsh language|Welsh-language]] [[poet]]s of the 20th century.

==Life==
Waldo Goronwy Williams was born in [[Haverfordwest]], [[Pembrokeshire]], the third child of John Edwal Williams (1863–1934), headmaster of Prendergast primary school in Haverfordwest, and his wife Angharad Williams (1875–1932). His father spoke both Welsh and English, but his mother only spoke English, as did Waldo himself in his early years.

In 1911 Waldo's father was appointed head of the primary school at [[Mynachlog-ddu]], Pembrokeshire. There Waldo learnt to speak Welsh. In 1915 his father moved again, to be head of Brynconin School, the primary school at [[Llandissilio]], Pembrokeshire. Waldo was raised as a [[Baptist]] and baptised as a member of Blaenconin Baptist Chapel in 1921 at the age of 16.

After attending the grammar school at [[Narberth, Pembrokeshire|Narberth]], Pembrokeshire, Williams studied at the [[University of Wales, Aberystwyth|University College of Wales, Aberystwyth]], where he graduated in English in 1926. He then trained as a teacher and worked in various schools in Pembrokeshire and the rest of Wales and England, including [[Kimbolton School]], [[Huntingdonshire]]. He also taught night classes for the Department of Extra-Mural Studies at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth.

In the 1920s and 1930s, Williams was a friend and supporter of Willie Jenkins (Hoplas), one of the pioneers of the [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP) and the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in Pembrokeshire. Jenkins was a [[Pacifism|pacifist]], who had been imprisoned as a [[conscientious objector]] in the [[First World War]]. He stood as Labour candidate for [[Pembrokeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Pembrokeshire]] in four elections between 1922 and 1935. Williams's famous poem "Cofio" (Remembering) was written in 1931 during a visit to Willie Jenkins's farm at Hoplas, [[Rhoscrowther]], near Pembroke.<ref>Williams's friendship with Jenkins and the inspiration for "Cofio": [https://biography.wales/article/s11-WILL-WAL-1904 Robert Rhys' entry on Waldo in the ''Dictionary of Welsh Biography''] and the Waldo Williams Society website,  [http://www.waldowilliams.com/?page_id=97&lang=en] and [http://www.waldowilliams.com/?page_id=271&lang=en].</ref>

Williams married Linda Llewellyn in 1941. Her death in 1943 caused him anguish and distress. He never remarried. Later he would describe his two-year  marriage as "fy mlynyddoedd mawr" – "my great years".<ref>See [http://www.waldowilliams.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Waldo-Williams-A2.pdf "The Waldo Tour"] (2013), Eirwen George and Damian Walford Davies, published by Waldo Williams Society (especially entry 18, Botwnnog).</ref>

A pacifist, he was a conscientious objector in the Second World War, which led to his dismissal from a headmastership. During the [[Korean War]] (1950–1953) he refused to pay his income tax on pacifist grounds as a protest against the war and forced military [[conscription]] – a protest he continued until compulsory [[military service]] ended in 1963 and all the conscripted had been released. His goods were sequestrated by bailiffs and he was twice imprisoned in the early 1960s for refusing to pay his income tax.

Meanwhile in the 1950s he joined the [[Quakers]] at [[Milford Haven]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Waldo Williams website |url=http://www.waldowilliams.com/?lang=en |access-date=31 August 2016}}</ref>

Williams's volume of poetry ''Dail Pren'' (Leaves of the Tree) was published in 1956 by [[Gwasg Gomer]]. It has been described as the most outstanding work of Welsh language poetry published since 1945.<ref>Davies, John ''A History of Wales'', Penguin, 1994, {{ISBN|0-14-014581-8}} (Revised edition 2007, {{ISBN|0-14-028475-3}})</ref>

By the 1950s, partly influenced by his friend [[David John Williams|D. J. Williams]], he had become a supporter of [[Plaid Cymru]] and stood for it as a parliamentary candidate in the [[Pembrokeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Pembrokeshire constituency]] at the [[1959 United Kingdom general election|1959 General Election]], winning 4.32 per cent (2,253) of the votes.<ref>{{Cite web |title=UK General Election results October 1959 |url=http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge59/ge59index.htm |access-date=18 August 2007}}. Pembrokeshire had returned a Labour M. P., [[Desmond Donnelly]], to the Commons since 1950. Donnelly's views differed from those of Willie Jenkins and Waldo Williams – Donnelly was a supporter of German rearmament in 1954 and a strong opponent of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament from 1958.</ref>

In the late 1960s, Williams taught Welsh to children of 10–11 at the Holy Name Catholic School, [[Fishguard]], Pembrokeshire. He is said to have been a mesmerising teacher, passionate and enthusiastic, who used wooden silhouettes of farm animals with their names painted in Welsh on one side.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Death and legacy==
Williams died in 1971 at St Thomas's Hospital, Haverfordwest, and was buried at Blaenconin Chapel burial ground in Llandissilio. There is a memorial at Rhos-fach, near to his childhood home in Mynachlog-ddu.

In 2019, Waldo Williams Primary School in Haverfordwest was named in his honour.<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Lynch |first1=David |title=New Haverfordwest school to be named after Waldo Williams |url=https://www.westerntelegraph.co.uk/news/17218830.new-haverfordwest-school-to-be-named-after-waldo-williams/ |access-date=10 March 2020 |work=[[Western Telegraph]] |date=13 November 2018}}</ref>

==Poetry==
[[File:Waldo_Memorial_H1a.jpg|thumb|Waldo Williams memorial, Rhos-fach, [[Mynachlog-ddu]]]]
Waldo Williams's poetry shows many influences, ranging from [[William Wordsworth]] and [[Walt Whitman]] to Welsh [[hymns]] and the strict alliterative metres of traditional Welsh poetry, known as [[cynghanedd]].

Waldo Williams belonged primarily to a Welsh tradition of the {{lang|cy|bardd gwlad}} or folk poets who served a locality by recording its life and people in verse, but he was also inspired by a [[Mysticism|mystic]] revelation experienced in his youth about the unity of humankind. This drew on the cooperative, harmonious living he witnessed in the farming communities in the [[Preseli Hills]] and reflected feelings of belonging, knowing and desiring that people live together in peace – constant themes in his poetry. This revelation inspired some of his greatest poetry, including "Mewn dau gae" (In two fields, 1956), perhaps his greatest of all. Other well-known poems of his include "Cofio" (Remembering, 1931), "Y tangnefeddwyr" (The peacemakers, 1941), "Preseli" (1946), and "Pa beth yw dyn?" (What is it to be human? 1952).
