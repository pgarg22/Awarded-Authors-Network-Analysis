'''Susan Mary Cooper''' (born 23 May 1935) is an [[English people|English]] author of children's books. She is best known for ''[[The Dark Is Rising Sequence|The Dark Is Rising]]'', a [[contemporary fantasy]] series set in England and Wales, which incorporates British mythology, such as the [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] legends, and Welsh folk heroes.<ref name=hand/> 
For that work, in 2012 she won the lifetime [[Margaret A. Edwards Award]] from the [[American Library Association]], recognizing her contribution to writing for teens.<ref name=edwards/> In the 1970s two of the five novels were named the year's best English-language book with an "authentic Welsh background" by the [[Welsh Books Council]].<ref name=tirnanog/>

== Biography ==

Cooper was born in 1935 in [[Burnham, Buckinghamshire]], to Ethel May (''née'' Field) and her husband John Richard Cooper.<ref name=chaston/> Her father had worked in the reading room of the Natural History Museum until going off to fight in the Second World War, from which he returned with a wounded leg. He then pursued a career in the offices of the [[Great Western Railway]]. Her mother was a teacher of ten-year-olds and eventually became deputy head of a large school. Her younger brother Roderick also grew up to become a writer.<ref name=chaston/> 

Cooper lived in Buckinghamshire until she was 21, when her parents moved to her grandmother's village of [[Aberdyfi]] in Wales. She attended [[Slough High School]] and then earned a degree in [[English studies|English]] at [[Somerville College]] at the [[University of Oxford]], where she was the first woman to edit the undergraduate newspaper [[Cherwell (newspaper)|''Cherwell'']].<ref>Charles Butler, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fxNyH4uE100C&pg=PA14 ''Four British Fantasists: Place and Culture in the Children's Fantasies of Penelope Lively, Alan Garner, Diana Wynne Jones, and Susan Cooper''] (Rowman & Littlefield, 2006), page 14.</ref>

After graduating, she worked as a [[reporter]] for ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' (London) under [[Ian Fleming]] and wrote in her spare time. During that period she began work on the series ''The Dark Is Rising'' and finished her [[debut novel]], the [[science fiction]] ''Mandrake'', published by [[Hodder & Stoughton]] in 1964.<ref name=isfdb/>

Cooper emigrated to the United States in 1963 to marry Nicholas J. Grant, a Professor of [[Metallurgy]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], and a widower with three teenage children.<ref name=chaston/> She had two children with him, Jonathan Roderick Howard Grant (b. 1965) and Katharine Mary Grant (b. 1966; later Katharine Glennon). She then became a full-time writer, focusing on ''The Dark Is Rising'' and on ''Dawn of Fear'' (1970), a novel based on her experiences of the Second World War. Eventually she wrote fiction for both children and adults, a series of picture books, film screenplays, and works for the stage.

Around the time of writing ''Seaward'' (1983), both of her parents died, and her marriage to Grant was dissolved.<ref name=chaston/>

In July 1996, she married the Canadian-American actor and her sometime co-author [[Hume Cronyn]], the widower of [[Jessica Tandy]]. (Cronyn and Tandy had starred in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway production]] of ''[[Foxfire (play)|Foxfire]]'', written by Cooper and Cronyn and staged in 1982.)<ref name=ibdb/> 
Cooper and Cronyn remained married until his death in June 2003.

[[Hollywood]] [[film adaptation|adapted]] ''The Dark Is Rising'' (1973) as a film in 2007, ''[[The Seeker (film)|The Seeker]]''.<ref name=imdb>{{IMDb title|id=0484562|title=The Seeker}} Retrieved 2012-03-25.</ref>
It disappointed Cooper, who requested that some changes from her narrative be reverted, to no avail.<ref name=adler/>
 
Cooper was on the Board of the [[National Children's Book and Literacy Alliance]] (NCBLA), a US [[nonprofit organization]] that advocates for literacy, literature, and libraries {{nowrap|(2006<ref name=ncbla-bod06>{{cite web|title=The NCBLA Board of Directors|url=http://www.thencbla.org/boarddirectors.html|website=NCBLA|access-date=2006-10-04|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004014752/http://www.thencbla.org/boarddirectors.html|archive-date=2006-10-04}}</ref>–2012<ref name=ncbla-bod12>{{cite web|title=The NCBLA Board of Directors|url=http://www.thencbla.org/boarddirectors.html|website=NCBLA|access-date=2012-03-22|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322093151/http://www.thencbla.org/boarddirectors.html|archive-date=2012-03-22}}</ref>)}}.

Her latest work in 2013 was ''Ghost Hawk'', featuring the spirit of a [[Wampanoag]], people decimated by European disease, who witnesses the transformation of Massachusetts by the [[Plymouth Colony]].<ref name="LCC2013">[http://lccn.loc.gov/2012039892 ''Ghost Hawk'']. LCC record. Retrieved 2013-02-12.</ref>

In April 2017, Cooper gave the fifth annual [[Tolkien Lecture]] at [[Pembroke College, Oxford]], speaking on the role of fantasy literature in contemporary society.<ref>[https://tolkienlecture.org/2017/04/30/susan-coopers-tolkien-lecture/ Photographs, podcast, and video for Susan Cooper's Tolkien Lecture], ''The J.R.R. Tolkien Lecture on Fantasy Literature'', 2017-04-30. Retrieved 2017-06-20.</ref>

She lives in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], as of October 2012.<!--LC cites her website, that date--><ref name=mcelderry/>

==Awards==

For her lifetime contribution as a children's writer, Cooper was U.S. nominee in 2002 for the biennial, international [[Hans Christian Andersen Award]], the highest international recognition available to creators of children's books.<ref name=andersen/><ref name=ibby-nominee/>

The [[American Library Association]]'s [[Margaret A. Edwards Award]] recognises one writer and a particular body of work for "significant and lasting contribution to young adult literature". Cooper won the award in 2012 citing the five Dark Is Rising novels, published 1965 to 1977. The citation observed, "In one of the most influential epic high fantasies in literature, Cooper evokes Celtic and Arthurian mythology and masterly world-building in a high-stakes battle between good and evil, embodied in the coming of age journey of Will Stanton."<ref name=edwards/>

She has also been recognised for single books:
*1974, Newbery Honor (runner-up for the Medal), ''The Dark Is Rising'' (1973 novel)<ref name=newbery/>
*1976, [[Newbery Medal]], ''The Grey King''<ref name=newbery/>
