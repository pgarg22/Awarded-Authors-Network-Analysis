His writing style caught the attention of the film industry due to his prowess in using traditional poetic rules related to [[alliteration]] and [[rhyme]] for describing [[Current affairs (news format)|current affairs]].

==Career as a lyricist==

===Entry into films===

Veturi had contacts with the [[Cinema of Andhra Pradesh|Telugu film industry]] during his days as a journalist. He used to meet veteran [[Lyricist|lyric writer]] [[Daasaradhi Krishnamacharyulu|Dasarathi]] often. Legendary director [[Chittor V. Nagaiah]] offered him a role in his film, ''[[Naa Illu]]''.<ref>[http://www.eenadu.net/archives/archive-23-5-2010/ncineshow.asp?qry=cinefront1 ]{{dead link|date=September 2015}}</ref> However, two days before the shooting began, Veturi decided not to act as he felt that he was not fit for acting, and wrote a letter of apology to [[Chittor V. Nagaiah|Nagaiah]] for rejecting his offer. Sri.[[N.T. Rama Rao]], has invited him to join the film industry] as a lyricist. In 1974, he wrote his first song, "Bharatanaari Charitamu" ({{lang-te|భారతనారి చరితము}}), in the form of [[Harikatha]], for ''[[O Seeta Katha]]'' under the direction of the legendary director, [[K. Viswanath|K Viswanath]].

===1970s===

In 1977, actor [[N. T. Rama Rao|Sr. N.T.R]]'s ''[[Adavi Ramudu (1977 film)|Adavi Ramudu]]'' showcased Veturi's talent for penning inspirational and romantic lyrics. The album was an instant hit among various audiences. In 1978, [[K. Viswanath|K Viswanath]]'s ''[[Siri Siri Muvva]]'' proved his prowess in expressing diverse emotions with poetry. [[Aatreya (playwright)|Aathreya]], the leading lyricist in those days, was known to take days for writing a song. Veturi became the first choice for directors and producers too because of his ability to write a song to the director's taste in a few minutes. He went on to pen more than 5,000 songs in his career. He wrote more mass numbers for movies like ''Vetagadu'' and ''Driver Ramudu'', and classics for movies like ''[[Sankarabharanam (1980 film)|Sankarabharanam]]'' and [[Sagara Sangamam]]. In particular, ''[[Sankarabharanam (1980 film)|Sankarabharanam]]'' stood as a landmark in the [[Cinema of Andhra Pradesh|Telugu film industry]].

===1980s===

After the surge of his popularity during the 1970s, he went on to work with a variety of directors and actors in the 1980s. He wrote classics for directors like [[Singeetam Srinivasa Rao]], [[Dasari Narayana Rao]], [[Bapu (director)|Bapu]], [[Jandhyala]], [[Vamsy]] and mass numbers for directors like [[Kovelamudi Raghavendra Rao|Raghavendra Rao]], [[A. Kodandarami Reddy]], [[Vijaya Bapineedu]]. He delivered a number of hits for senior actors like [[N. T. Rama Rao|Sr. N.T.R]], [[Akkineni Nageswara Rao]], [[Shobhan Babu]], [[Krishnam Raju]], [[Ghattamaneni Krishna]] and upcoming stars like [[Chiranjeevi]], [[Nandamuri Balakrishna]], [[Nagarjuna (actor)|Nagarjuna]], [[Daggubati Venkatesh]]. This golden period in his career saw memorable albums like ''[[Saptapadi (1981 film)|Saptapadi]]'', ''Subhodayam'', ''[[Subhalekha]]'', ''[[Sagara Sangamam]]'', ''[[Meghasandesam]]'', ''Mudda Mandaram'', ''Malle Pandiri'', ''Nalugu Stambhalata'', ''[[Rendu Jalla Seeta]]'', ''[[Amarajeevi]]'', ''[[Sreevariki Prema Lekha]]'', ''[[Ananda Bhairavi (Telugu film)|Ananda Bhairavi]]'', ''Srivari Sobhanam'', ''Mogudu Pellalu'', ''[[Chantabbai]]'', ''[[Sitaara]]'', ''[[Anveshana]]'', ''[[Alapana]]'', ''[[Mayuri (film)|Mayuri]]'', ''Amavasya Chandrudu'', ''Janaki Ramudu'' and ''[[Geethanjali (1989 film)|Geetaanjali]]''.

===1990s===

During the late 1980s, Veturi's mass numbers garnered a lot of response from the public resulting in directors demanding more and more of them. However, Veturi still maintained his balance between classics and mass-numbers with movies like ''[[Jagadeka Veerudu Atiloka Sundari]]'', ''Sarigamalu'', ''Sitaramayya Gaari Manavaralu'', ''[[Matru Devo Bhava]]'', and ''[[Mechanic Alludu]]''. Veturi was given the opportunity to dub many [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Malayalam]] and [[Hindi]] movies. Some of his dubbed albums, for instance ''Iruvar'' and ''[[Devaraagam]]'', received wide acclaim.

===2000s===

During this period, Veturi created classics like ''[[Gangotri (film)|Gangotri]]'' and ''[[Swarabhishekam]]''. His association with young directors like [[Sekhar Kammula]] and [[Gunasekhar]] produced some memorable albums, like ''[[Anand (2004 film)|Anand]]'', ''[[Godavari (film)|Godavari]]'', ''[[Varudu]]'', ''[[Arjun (2004 film)|Arjun]]'', ''[[Kaadhal|Premishte]]'' (Dubbed version of Kaadhal) and ''[[Leader (2010 film)|Leader]]''.

==Books==

===''Sirikaakolanu Chinnadi''===

This book was originally a "musical play" telecasted on the All India Radio. The story describes the culture and people during the time of the king [[Krishna Deva Raya]] through the story of a Devadasi.<ref>AVKF review on this book. Available at: http://www.avkf.org/BookLink/display_author_books.php?author_id=211</ref> The original play has music by the great music director [[Pendyala Nageswara Rao]]. One can see the beauty of the Telugu language in this book.
Veturi was introduced to the director [[K. Viswanath]] through this book and later their combination was a big hit. [[N.T.Rama Rao]] was so impressed by the story of this book that he wanted to make it as a movie. It is believed that there were some discussions on the script but the movie was never produced.

===''Kommako Kommako Sannaayi''===

A book titled ''komma kommakO sannAyi'' was published by "Veturi Sahitii Samiti". This book contains 27 articles written by Veturi celebrating his association with some famous personalities in the Telugu film industry. It also contains descriptions of some of his songs. The personalities covered include the following:
# '''Music directors:''' Pendyala Nageswara Rao, [[S. Rajeswara Rao]], [[K. V. Mahadevan]], Adi Narayana Rao, Ramesh Naidu, Rajan – Nagendra, Chakravarty, Ilayaraja, MM Keeravaani & A.R.Rahman
# '''Singers:''' [[S.P. Balasubrahmanyam|S._P._Balasubrahmanyam]]
# '''Lyricists:''' Daita Gopalam, Samudrala (Sr), Atreya, Dasarathi,
# '''Actors:''' Nagayya, Jagayya, [[N. T. Rama Rao]] & Relangi
# '''Directors and producers:''' Nagi Reddy, Jandhyala, Bapu – Ramana

Many of these articles were originally published in a Telugu magazine called ''Haasam''. Veturi's prowess in the Telugu language & literature and his vast knowledge of Carnatic music can be seen in this book. Veturi often quotes many of his own lyrics in this book and those examples offer a glimpse of his genius. In particular, his explanation of the song ''Swararaaga gangaa pravaahamE'' (Movie: ''Sarigamalu'') is a masterpiece.
