'''Ruth Hale''' (October 14, 1908 &ndash; April 20, 2003) was an [[United States|American]] [[playwright]] and [[actress]].

==Biography==
Hale was born in [[Granger, Utah]] (now West Valley City), and was an active member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. She and her husband, James Nathan Hale, moved to [[California]] to seek out opportunities in [[Hollywood]]. With little success finding film roles, they founded the [[Glendale, California|Glendale]] Centre Theater.  Ruth Hale wrote many original plays for the venue including ''A Choice Land'' and ''How Near the Angels''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mormonlit.byu.edu/lit_author.php?a_id=6923|title=Mormon Literature Database |publisher=Mormonlit.byu.edu |accessdate=2013-12-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005045454/http://mormonlit.byu.edu/lit_author.php?a_id=6923 |archive-date=2011-10-05}}</ref>

Soon, they and their extended family had opened a number of [[Hale Center Theatre|theaters featuring a center stage]] (arena theaters or [[Theater in the round]]) throughout [[Utah]] and [[Arizona]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.halecentretheatre.org/information/theatrehistory.php|title=Utah's Premiere Family Theatre|publisher=Hale Centre Theatre|date=1970-01-01|accessdate=2013-12-22|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105170039/http://www.halecentretheatre.org/information/theatrehistory.php|archivedate=January 5, 2009}}</ref>

The Hales were also playwrights. They wrote their first play together, ''Handcart Trails,'' to save on the budget of a ward play production in Granger in the 1930s. This play was published in the ''MIA Book of Plays'' in 1940. Their play, ''Melody Jones'', was shown to a national audience by [[Kurt Television Theatre]]. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}
