'''Raymond Joseph David Stanislaus Flanagan''' (November 29, 1903 - June 3, 1990) was a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] priest and [[Trappists|Trappist]] monk.

== Biography ==
He was born and raised in an Irish-Catholic family in [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury, Massachusetts]]. He had nine siblings. Two of his brothers also became priests and two of his sisters became nuns. Joseph entered the [[Society of Jesus]] as a high school senior and was ordained a priest on 22 July 1933. As a Jesuit, he gave many retreats and coached the debating team at  [[College of the Holy Cross]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]]. He did his [[Tertianship]] in [[Port Townsend, Washington|Port Townsend]] in 1934/1935 and soon after (1936) transferred to the Trappist [[Abbey of Our Lady of Gethsemani|Abbey of Gethsemani]]; he made [[Religious vows|solemn vows]] there as ''Father Raymond'' on 5 April 1942.

Flanagan was one of two famous author-monks living in Gethsemani Abbey; the other was [[Thomas Merton]]. The monks corresponded frequently,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pearson|first=Paul M.|date=2017|title=The Seven Storey Goldmine|journal=The Catholic Library World|volume=87|issue=3|pages=168–177}}</ref> and Merton even wrote limericks about his confrere Fr. Raymond.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Merton|first=Thomas|date=1998|title=Five Limericks for Father Raymond|journal=The Merton Seasonal|volume=23|issue=2|pages=11–12}}</ref>

Fr. Raymond was buried in the Gethsemani cemetery.

== Writings (selection) ==
Flanagan's "publications were characterized by a hard-hitting, vigorous Catholic piety that accentuated American family values, fidelity to Catholic traditions, the beauty of religious vocations, anti-Communism, and the athletic asceticism he associated with the first Cistercians."<ref>Schachenmayr 2021, p. 77.</ref> Almost all of his books were translated into one or more languages, many were re-issued, and some are still in print today.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Avella|first=Steven|date=1992|title=Catholic Lay Activism in Milwaukee: The Bruce Family|journal=Records of the American Catholic Historical Society of Philadelphia|volume=103.3/4|issue=3/4|pages=1–11, here 9|jstor=44211181}}</ref> His book on the founders of Cîteaux Abbey (Saints Robert, [[Alberic of Cîteaux|Alberic]], and [[Stephen Harding|Stephen]]) was titled ''Three Religious Rebels''; it is particularly popular among novices learning about the history of the [[Cistercians|Cistercian Order]]. In general, Flanagan's books appealed to readers fascinated by the austerities of life in a Trappist monastery. Regarding a 1949 book (the fourth in the series "Saga of Cîteaux"), his publisher P. J. Kenedy ran an advertisement in the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] that read: "you cannot know the Trappist monks until you have read ''Burnt Out Incense, History of the Monastery of Gethsemani in Kentucky.''"<ref>{{Cite news|date=17 July 1949|title=Advertisement|page=BR27|work=New York Times}}</ref>

''The Man who Got Even with God'' is one of Flanagan's most widely-read books. It is about Brother Mary Joachim Hanning, a wild cowboy who became a Cistercian (Trappist) monk in Kentucky. As a hot-tempered young man, Hanning took revenge on his father by burning down a barn full of his father’s freshly cut tobacco. He then ran away and led the life of a wandering cowboy for years. He eventually returned home and reconciled with his family, later converting to a pious Catholic life after his mother died. John decided to “get even with God” by following a desire he had held in secret for years: to enter the [[novitiate]] at Gethsemani Abbey. ''The Mark Twain Quarterly'' called this work of historical fiction "A 'must' book for all who take their religion seriously."<ref>{{Cite journal|date=1942|title=The Quarterly Recommends|journal=Mark Twain Quarterly|volume=5|issue=2|pages=21–22|jstor=42657797}}</ref>

The book ''Spiritual Secrets of a Trappist Monk'', originally published as ''You'' in 1957, was re-issued by [[Sophia Institute Press]] in 2000. It is one of Flanagan's most popular non-fiction books, devoted to showing that "who you are in Christ is much greater than you think", as reviewer Regis Jordan wrote. In it, Fr. Raymond "gives the keys to unlock," continued Jordan, "the mysteries of pain and of success and failure. In a startling way, he even discloses the mysteries of the future itself."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jordan|first=Regis|date=2001|title=Book review|journal=Spiritual Life|volume=47|issue=1|pages=61}}</ref>

The following list covers Flanagan's books. He also wrote dozens of pamphlets on subjects like the perils of communism (''Trappists, the Reds and You'', 1949), the beauty of religious vocations, and how to make homes into a Catholic environment. He also wrote several for men serving in the military and for their families (''For Your Own Defense. A Booklet for Catholics in the Service'', 1941).<ref>Schachenmayr 2021, p. 93-95.</ref>
