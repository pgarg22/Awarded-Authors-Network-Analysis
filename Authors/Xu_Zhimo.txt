Encyclopædia Britannica (2014): Research Starters. Web. 27 Jan. 2016.}}</ref> He is considered one of the most important figures of [[modern Chinese poetry]].

==Biography==
Xu Zhimo has several names. He is best known as {{lang|zh|徐志摩}} ([[Wu Chinese|Wu]] IPA: {{ipa|ʑi tsɿ mu}},<ref name="fudan haining">{{cite news|title=语言点浏览: 浙江省海宁市|trans-title=Language Record Browse: Haining City, Zhejiang Province|trans-work=East Asian Languages Data Center of [[Fudan University]]|work=复旦大学东亚语言数据中心|accessdate=16 February 2021|last=|first=|url=http://ccdc.fudan.edu.cn/linguae/languageRecord.jsp?id=5F5B5EA1-34D8-401D-B458-BDD188BD9A03}}</ref> Wu pinyin: Zhi Tsymu; Mandarin IPA: {{IPAc-cmn|x|u|2|-|zh|i|4|-|m|o|2}}, [[Mandarin pinyin]]: Xú Zhìmó, [[Wades-Giles]]: Hsü Chih-mo), while he is born as {{lang|zh|徐章垿}} (Mandarin pinyin: Xú Zhāngxù) with the courtesy name {{lang|zh|槱森}} (Mandarin pinyin: Yǒusēn).

Xu was born in [[Haining, Zhejiang]] and graduated from [[Hangzhou High School]], a school known for its fame in [[Southern China]]. He married [[Zhang Youyi]] in 1915 and proceeded to attend [[Peiyang University]] in 1916 (now [[Tianjin University]]) to study Law. In 1917, he moved to [[Peking University]] (PKU) due to the law department of Peiyang University merging into PKU. In 1918, he traveled to the United States to earn his bachelor's degree at [[Clark University]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], [[Massachusetts]], where he took up a major in political and social sciences, along with a minor in history. Shortly afterward, he enrolled at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City|New York]] to pursue a graduate degree in economics and politics in 1919. He left New York in 1921, having found the States "intolerable", to go study in England at [[King's College, Cambridge]], where he fell in love with English [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poetry like that of [[Keats]] and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]].<ref>[http://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/subjects/oriental.html Study at King's: Asian and Middle Eastern Studies]</ref>  He was also influenced by the French romantic and [[symbolists|symbolist]] poets, some of whose works he translated into Chinese. In 1922 he returned to China and became a leading figure of the modern poetry movement. In 1923, he founded the [[Crescent Moon Society]], a [[China|Chinese]] [[literary society]] that was part of the larger [[New Culture Movement]], believing in "art for art's sake" and often engaging in running debates with the "art for politic's sake" ([[Chinese Communist Party]]-driven) [[League of the Left-Wing Writers]].<ref name="CAM">{{cite book | last1=Fairbank | first1=John King | last2=Feuerwerker | first2=Albert | last3=Twitchett | first3=Denis Crispin| title= The Cambridge history of China | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge, England | year=1986 | isbn=978-0-521-24338-4}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=Fxs3ROaIhPMC&pg=PA428&lpg=PA428&dq=china+%22league+of+left+wing+writers%22&source=bl&ots=VyDSA5hSvV&sig=u7Oj4mxHoE1NQsl1RMaCG0AhU3k&hl=en&ei=FefWScWXN460NICxhYUP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3#PPA428,M1|link to excerpt]</ref> When the [[Bengali poetry|Bengali poet]] [[Rabindranath Tagore]] visited China, Xu Zhimo served as one of his oral interpreters. Xu was also renowned for his use of vernacular Chinese; he was one of the first Chinese writers to successfully naturalize Western romantic forms into modern Chinese poetry. He worked as an editor and professor at several schools before his death on 19 November 1931, dying in a plane crash near [[Tai'an|Tai'an, Shandong]]<ref name=eb2011>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/273976/Xu-Zhimo "Xu Zhimo."

He left behind four collections of verse and several volumes of translations from various languages.

===Love affairs===
Xu Zhimo's various love affairs with Zhang Youyi, [[Lin Huiyin]], and [[Lu Xiaoman]] are well known in China. Xu married Zhang Youyi,<ref name="library.thinkquest.org">[http://library.thinkquest.org/C0111522/english/intro.htm Reminiscences of Xu Zhimo]</ref> (the sister of the politician [[Zhang Junmai]]) on 10 October 1915. This was an arranged marriage that went against Xu's belief in free and simple love. Although Zhang gave birth to two sons, Xu still couldn't accept her. While in London in 1921, Xu met and fell in love with Lin Huiyin (the daughter of Lin Changmin). He divorced Zhang in March 1922. Inspired by this newly found love, Xu wrote a large number of poems during this time. Lin and Xu became close friends. However, she was already betrothed to [[Liang Sicheng]] by his father. Xu's last lover was Lu Xiaoman, who was married to Wang Geng, a friend of Xu. The marriage had been arranged by her parents and she felt trapped in this loveless marriage. When Xu and Lu met, they quickly bonded over the similarity of their respective experiences with arranged marriages. When it came to be known that they were in love, both were scorned by their parents and friends. Lu divorced her husband in 1925 and married Xu the next year.<ref name="library.thinkquest.org"/> Their honeymoon period did not last long however and Lu gradually became more and more depressed.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Because Lu was wasteful{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} and Xu's parents refused to lend them money, Xu had to take several jobs in different cities to keep up with the lifestyle Lu desired. She was widowed when Xu died in an airplane crash.

Xu was also romantically linked to American author [[Pearl S. Buck]] and American journalist [[Agnes Smedley]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Conn |first=Peter |year=1996 |title=Pearl S. Buck: A Cultural Biography |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-63989-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/pearlsbuck00pete/page/103 103, 397] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/pearlsbuck00pete/page/103 }}</ref>

In an obituary, writer [[Wen Yuan-ning]] commented that Xu's "relations with women are exactly like [Percy Bysshe] [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]]'s. Let no woman flatter herself that Tse-mo has ever loved her; he has only loved his own inner version of Ideal Beauty."<ref>"The Late Mr. Hsu Tse-mo, A Child," in [[Wen Yuan-ning]], "Imperfect Understanding: Intimate Portraits of Modern Chinese Celebrities," edited by Christopher Rea (Amherst, MA: Cambria Press, 2018), p. 45.</ref>

===Airplane crash===
{{main|1931 Jinan Air Crash}}
On 19 November 1931, Xu Zhimo prepared to leave [[Nanjing|Nanking]] to attend a lecture given by Lin Huiyin at a university in [[Beijing|Peking]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cctv.cntv.cn/lm/journeysintime/special/liangsicheng_linhuiyin/index.shtml|title=Liang Sicheng and Lin Huiyin, CNTV English， CCTV News}}</ref> He boarded a [[China Airways Federal]] [[Stinson Detroiter]],<ref>http://gregcrouch.com/2010/stinson-detroiter</ref> an aircraft contracted by [[Chunghwa Post]] to deliver airmail on the Nanjing-Beijing route.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnac.org/history01.htm|title=CNAC History}}</ref> However, when the flight arrived in the Jinan area, the flight encountered severe fog, leaving the pilot with no clear view to land. The plane descended into the mountainous area below unnoticed as both the pilots were looking for the course according to the map. When the aircraft was aiming to turn left to go back to the course again, it hit the peak of a mountain and broke off the right wing. The plane spun out of control and crashed into the mountains near [[Tai'an]] City, in [[Shandong]] province.<ref name="eb2011"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cctv.cntv.cn/lm/journeysintime/20110617/107447.shtml|title=Lin Huiyin & Xu Zhimo}}</ref> Xu Zhimo, who suffered from fatal [[cerebral trauma]] and several cuts on his body, was killed instantly as well as one of the two pilots.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.china.com/history/all/11025807/20150529/19765167.html|title = 404 提示信息}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wenku.baidu.com/link?url=W5CnL9XIXqD0CtRrP7Bnj--tyOua4QyHmhXhlGQ1cIh9-VJN4Y0yvNMM147nXHZM2-b-CfHDSYkVJGcECdXZsKWGatI4KCtMuZViMC2hAVS|title = 徐志摩济南开山坠机始末 – 百度文库}}</ref> The first officer however, survived the initial impact, but also perished due to protracted rescue.

The accident was attributed to both pilots' misjudgement of the flight's altitude as well as their failure to recognize the terrain.

However, it was rumoured that the death of Xu Zhimo was murder,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://zhidao.baidu.com/question/312453739.html|title=徐志摩的死是意外吗_百度知道}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_647eb0960102w0fj.html|title = 镶嵌在心底的美丽（2015）34·悄悄的我走了_胖企鹅杨_新浪博客}}</ref> but this was confirmed to be untrue.

'''再别康橋'''

輕輕的我走了，
正如我輕輕的來；
我輕輕的招手，
作別西天的雲彩。

那河畔的金柳，
是夕陽中的新娘；
波光裡的艷影，
在我的心頭蕩漾。

軟泥上的青荇，
油油地在水底招搖；
在康河的柔波裡，
我甘心做一條水草！

那榆蔭下的一潭，
不是清泉，是天上虹；
揉碎在浮藻間，
沉澱著彩虹似的夢。

尋夢？撐一支長篙，
向青草更青處漫溯；
滿載一船星輝，
在星輝斑斕裡放歌。

但我不能放歌，
悄悄是別離的笙簫；
夏蟲也為我沉默，
沉默是今晚的康橋！

悄悄的我走了，
正如我悄悄的來；
我揮一揮衣袖，
不帶走一片雲彩。

Taking Leave of Cambridge Again<!-- Please do not change this title.  Since we are using Guohua Chen's translation, we should also use Guohua Chen's version of the title.

By Xu Zhimo

Softly I am leaving,
Just as softly as I came;
I softly wave goodbye
To the clouds in the western sky.

The golden willows by the riverside
Are young brides in the setting sun;
Their glittering reflections on the shimmering river
Keep undulating in my heart.

The green tape grass rooted in the soft mud
Sways leisurely in the water;
I am willing to be such a waterweed
In the gentle flow of the River Cam.

That pool in the shade of elm trees
Holds not clear spring water, but a rainbow
Crumpled in the midst of duckweeds,
Where rainbow-like dreams settle.

To seek a dream? Go punting with a long pole,
Upstream to where green grass is greener,
With the punt laden with starlight,
And sing out loud in its radiance.

Yet now I cannot sing out loud,
Peace is my farewell music;
Even crickets are now silent for me,
For Cambridge this evening is silent.

Quietly I am leaving,
Just as quietly as I came;
Gently waving my sleeve,
I am not taking away a single cloud.

(6 November 1928)
