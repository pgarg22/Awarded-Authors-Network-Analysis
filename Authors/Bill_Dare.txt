He wrote and appeared in his own Radio 4 sketch show, ''[[Life, Death and Sex with Mike and Sue]]'' which ran for five series. More recently he has emerged as a more serious writer. Dare's first novel, ''Natural Selection'' is published in the UK and US, and his first stage play, ''Touch'', was performed at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]] in 2007. His second play, "Misconception" was also performed at Edinburgh.

His radio series, ''[[Brian Gulliver's Travels]]'' is now a novel, published by [[Pilrig Press]] 2013. His third novel, The Billion Pound Lie, is about a man who is mistaken for a lottery winner and was described as 'a funny, touching novel about friendship, love and lottery tickets' by Erin Kelly.{{cn|date=October 2021}}
