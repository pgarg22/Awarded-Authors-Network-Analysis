'''John Harold Hewitt''' (28 October 1907 – 22 June 1987), who was born in [[Belfast]], Ireland, present day [[Northern Ireland]], was the most significant Belfast [[poet]] to emerge before the 1960s generation of [[Irish poetry|Northern Irish poets]] that included [[Seamus Heaney]], [[Derek Mahon]] and [[Michael Longley]]. He was appointed the first writer-in-residence at [[Queen's University Belfast]] in 1976. His collections include ''The Day of the Corncrake'' (1969) and ''Out of My Time: Poems 1969 to 1974'' (1974). He was also made a Freeman of the City of Belfast in 1983, and was awarded [[honorary doctorate]]s the [[University of Ulster]] and Queen's University Belfast.<ref name="Collection">[http://library.ulster.ac.uk/craine/hewitt/life.htm John Hewitt (1907–1987)], John Hewitt Collection, University of Ulster, accessed 27 August 2007</ref>

From November 1930 to 1957, Hewitt held positions in the [[Belfast Museum & Art Gallery]]. His radical socialist ideals proved unacceptable to the Belfast Unionist establishment and he was passed over for promotion in 1953. Instead in 1957 he moved to [[Coventry]], a city still rebuilding following [[Coventry Blitz|its devastation]] during [[World War II]] . Hewitt was appointed Director of the [[Herbert Art Gallery & Museum]] where he worked until retirement in 1972.<ref name=ODNB/>

Hewitt had an active political life, describing himself as "a man of the left", and was involved in the [[British Labour Party]], the [[Fabian Society]] and the Belfast Peace League.<ref name="Left">[http://library.ulster.ac.uk/craine/hewitt/life.htm#left John Hewitt: Man of the Left], John Hewitt Collection, University of Ulster, accessed 27 August 2007</ref> He was attracted to the [[Ulster]] dissenting tradition and was drawn to a concept of regional identity within the island of Ireland, describing his identity as Ulster, Irish, British and European.<ref name="Biography">[http://www.johnhewitt.org/biography.php Biography: John Harold Hewitt (1907–1987)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070731110108/http://www.johnhewitt.org/biography.php |date=31 July 2007 }}, John Hewitt International Summer School, accessed 27 August 2007</ref> John Hewitt officially opened the Belfast Unemployed Resource Centre (BURC) Offices on [[May Day|Mayday]] 1985.<ref>[http://www.avecsolutions.net/book/TheJohnHewitt41-44.pdf Belfast Unemployed Resource Centre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928074401/http://www.avecsolutions.net/book/TheJohnHewitt41-44.pdf |date=28 September 2007 }}, ''Making Good Money in Belfast: Social Economy Businesses'', p. 44, accessed 27 August 2007</ref>

His life and work are celebrated in two prominent ways – the annual John Hewitt International Summer School – and, less conventionally, a Belfast pub is named after him – the John Hewitt Bar and Restaurant, which is situated on the city's Donegall Street and which opened in 1999.<ref>[http://www.avecsolutions.net/book/TheJohnHewitt41-44.pdf The John Hewitt: More than just a great pub] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928074401/http://www.avecsolutions.net/book/TheJohnHewitt41-44.pdf |date=28 September 2007 }}, ''Making Good Money in Belfast: Social Economy Businesses'', pp. 41–44, accessed 27 August 2007</ref> The [[Bar (establishment)|bar]] was named after him as he officially opened the Belfast Unemployed Resource Centre, which owns the establishment. It is a popular meeting place for local writers, musicians, journalists, students and artists. Both the [[Belfast Festival at Queen's]] and the [[Belfast Film Festival]] use the venue to stage events.

==Hewitt's life and writing==
{{more citations needed|date=March 2009}}

===Early life===
After attending Agnes Street National School, Hewitt attended the [[Royal Belfast Academical Institution]] from 1919 to 1920 <ref name=ODNB/> before moving to [[Methodist College Belfast]], where he was a keen cricketer.  In 1924, he started an English degree at the [[Queen's University of Belfast]], obtaining a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in 1930,<ref name="PRONI">[http://www.proni.gov.uk/records/private/hewitt.htm The John Hewitt Papers (D/3838)], [[Public Record Office of Northern Ireland]], accessed 27 August 2007</ref> which he followed by obtaining a teaching qualification from [[Stranmillis College]], Belfast.<ref name=ODNB/> During these years, his calling to radical and socialist causes deepened; he heard [[James Larkin]] address a Labour rally, began to write for a range of Trades Union and Socialist publications, and co-founded a journal entitled ''Iskra''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Hewitt also attended the [[Northern Ireland Labour Party]] Annual Conference as a Belfast City delegate in 1929 and 1930. He resisted the advocacy of a workers’ republic in the party's constitution.<ref>{{Cite web |url =http://www.ricorso.net/rx/az-data/authors/h/Hewitt_J/life.htm |title =John Hewitt: Life, &c. |access-date =2008-01-05 |publisher =Ricorso }}</ref>

In 1930, Hewitt was appointed Art Assistant at the [[Ulster Museum|Belfast Museum and Art Gallery]], where amongst other duties, he gave public lectures on art, at one of which he met Roberta "Ruby" Black, whom he was to marry in 1934.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.niliteraryarchive.com/content/%E2%80%8Bjohn-harold-hewitt|title=John Hewitt|last=admin|date=2016-06-14|website=www.niliteraryarchive.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-26}}</ref> Roberta was also a convinced Socialist, and the couple became members of the [[Independent Labour Party]], the Belfast Peace League, the [[Left Book Club]]<ref name="Left"/> and the [[Liberty (pressure group)|British Civil Liberties Union]].

===Early writing===
Hewitt began experimenting with poetry while still a schoolboy at Methodist College in the 1920s. Typically thorough, his notebooks from these years are filled with hundreds of poems, in dozens of styles; Hewitt's main influences at this time included [[William Blake]], [[William Morris]] and [[W. B. Yeats]], and for the most part the verse is either highly [[Romanticism|romantic]], or strongly [[Socialism|socialist]], a theme which increased in prominence as the 1930s began. Morris is the key figure, combining both these strains, and allowing Hewitt to articulate the radical, [[Dissenter|dissenting]] strain which he inherited from his [[Methodist]] forbearers, including his father.

As the 1920s moved into the 1930s, Hewitt's writing began to develop and mature. Firstly, his role models (including [[Vachel Lindsay]]) became more modern; secondly, he discovered in Chinese poetry a voice which was "quiet and undemonstrative but clear and direct",<ref>from his unpublished autobiography, ''A North Light''</ref> and which answered a part of Hewitt's temperament which had been suppressed. Finally, and most importantly, he began his lifelong work of excavation and discovery of the poetry of Ulster, starting with [[Richard Rowley]], [[Joseph Campbell (poet)|Joseph Campbell]] and [[George William Russell]] (AE). This research culminated, in part, with the publications of ''Fibres, Fabric and Cordage'' in 1948, ''Rhyming Weavers and other Country Poets of Antrim and Down'' (based on his MA thesis, ''Ulster Poets 1800–1870'' of 1951) in 1974, and a book called ''The Rhyming Weavers'' in 1979. All of these publications and more, were based on his interest in the [[Weaver Poets|Ulster rhyming weaver poets]] of the 19th century, such as [[Henry MacDonald Flecher]], [[David Herbison]], [[Alexander MacKenzie (poet)|Alexander MacKenzie]], [[James MacKowen]], and [[James Orr (poet)|James Orr]].

Hewitt himself felt that his [[juvenilia]] ended with the poem ''Ireland'' (1932), which he placed at the start of his ''Collected Poems'' (1968), and indeed it is more complex than most of his earlier work, and begins his lifelong preoccupation with bleak landscapes of bog and rock; with exile, and with the nature of belonging.

===The 1930s===
The 1930s was a period of transition in Hewitt's poetry, one in which he began seriously to address the tortured history of his native province, and the contradictions between his love for the people and the landscape, his inspiration in the radical dissenting tradition, and the bloody, fratricidal conflicts which scar Northern Ireland to this day. A key text is ''The Bloody Brae: A Dramatic Poem'' (finished in 1936, though not broadcast – on the Northern Ireland Home Service of the [[BBC]] – until 1954; the Belfast Lyric Players performed a stage version in 1957, which they revived in 1986), which tells of a legendary massacre of [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] by [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwellian]] troops in [[Islandmagee]], County Antrim, in 1642. John Hill, one of the soldiers who has been racked by guilt since he participated in the slaughter, returns many years later to beg forgiveness. This he receives from the ghost of one of his victims, a gesture which she wraps in a condemnation of his self-indulgence, luxuriating in his guilt rather than taking positive action to combat bigotry. Another theme which was to become a fixture in Hewitt's poetry also first appears in ''The Bloody Brae''; that is, a bold assertion of the right of his people  to live in Ulster, rooted in their hard work and commitment to it:
:This is my country; my grandfather came here
:and raised his walls and fenced the tangled waste
:and gave his years and strength into the earth
Also in the 1930s, Hewitt was involved in with a group of young artists and sculptors known as the 'Ulster Unit', and acted as their secretary.<ref name="Collection"/>

===1940s and 1950s===
From the late thirties Hewitt was one of a set of [[Linen Hall Library]] members who would regularly retire to Campbell's Cafe in Belfast's city centre.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sam Hanna Bell: a Biography|last=McMahon|first=Sean|publisher=Blackstaff Press|year=1999|isbn=0-85640-665-1|location=Belfast|page=[https://archive.org/details/samhannabellbiog00mcma/page/20 20]|url=https://archive.org/details/samhannabellbiog00mcma/page/20}}.</ref> The regulars, at various points, included writers John Boyd, [[Denis Ireland]], [[Sam Hanna Bell]] and [[Richard Rowley]], actors [[Joseph Tomelty]], Jack Loudon and [[J.G. Devlin]], the poet [[Robert Greacen]], artists Padraic Woods, [[Gerard Dillon]], and [[William Conor]] and (an outspoken opponent of sectarianism) the Rev. Arthur Agnew. The ebullient atmosphere the circle created was a backdrop the appearance of Campbell's Cafe in [[Brian Moore (novelist)|Brian Moore]]'s wartime ''[[Bildungsroman]]'', [[The Emperor of Ice-Cream (novel)|The Emperor of Ice-Cream]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Brian Moore, A Biography|last=Craig|first=Patricia|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2002|isbn=0-7475-6844-8|location=London|page=79}}</ref>

During the 1940s and 1950s, Hewitt increasingly played the role of reviewer and art critic. He gained an [[Master of Arts|MA]] from [[Queen's University Belfast]], with a thesis on Ulster poets from 1800–1870, in 1951.<ref name="Collection"/> In 1951 he had been appointed deputy director and keeper of art at the [[Belfast Museum and Art Gallery]] but in 1957, Hewitt left to take up the position of Art Director at the [[Herbert Art Gallery and Museum]] in [[Coventry]], a position he held until 1972.<ref name=ODNB>Frank Ormsby, ‘Hewitt, John Harold (1907–1987)’, rev. [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], Oxford University Press, 2004</ref> While in [[Coventry]], Hewitt started work on his unpublished autobiography, ''A North Light''. He subsequently returned to [[Belfast]] on his retirement in 1972.<ref name="Collection"/> The John Hewitt Estate and [[Four Courts Press]] published ''A North Light: twenty-five years in a Municipal Gallery'' in 2013.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hewitt|first=John Harold|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/888090596|title=A north light : twenty-five years in a municipal art gallery|date=2013|publisher=Four Courts Press|others=Frank Ferguson, Kathryn Nan Sharon White|isbn=1-84682-490-7|location=Dublin, Ireland|oclc=888090596}}</ref>

==Legacy==
The John Hewitt Society was established in 1987 to commemorate his life and work. Its mission is "to promote literature, arts, and culture inspired by the ideals and ideas of the poet John Hewitt".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://johnhewittsociety.org/about-us/|title=About Us|publisher=John Hewitt Society|access-date=20 July 2015}}</ref> The Society runs an annual summer school.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://johnhewittsociety.org/summer-school/|title=Summer School|publisher=John Hewitt Society|access-date=20 July 2015}}</ref>
