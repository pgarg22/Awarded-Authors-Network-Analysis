==Background==
Ziegler was born on a farm to a 39-year-old mother and an even older father.  He had at least one older brother, Samuel, who moved to [[Iowa]] when Calvin was still young.  When he was sixteen, Calvin went to join Samuel, eventually graduating the [[University of Iowa]] in 1878.  He returned to Rebersburg and pursued teaching, but left again in October 1881 to study Greek and Latin at [[Harvard]]. In 1884 he graduated magna cum laude and returned briefly to Rebersburg. He left for good in 1885, settling in [[St. Louis]].

Ziegler published a volume of poems with a [[Leipzig]] publisher in 1891, ''[[Drauss un Deheem]]'', helping spur a revival of Pennsylvania Dutch literature.  Included in the volume in a set of nineteen poems devoted to his mother, who died weeks before his Harvard graduation.  The volume was republished in Pennsylvania 1936, with some additional material.
