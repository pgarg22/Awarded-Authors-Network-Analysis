==Early life==
Hilary Mary Thompson was born in [[Glossop]], [[Derbyshire]], the eldest of three children, and raised as a Catholic<ref name=catholic/> in the [[mill village]] of [[Hadfield, Derbyshire|Hadfield]] where she attended St&nbsp;Charles [[Roman Catholic]] Primary School. Her parents, Margaret (née Foster) and Henry Thompson, were both of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent but born in England.<ref name="NYer">{{cite web |first=Larissa |last=MacFarquhar |author-link=Larissa MacFarquhar |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/10/15/121015fa_fact_macfarquhar?currentPage=all |title=How Hilary Mantel Revitalized Historical Fiction|work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=15 October 2012|access-date=17 October 2012}}</ref> Her parents separated and she did not see her father after the age of eleven.

She explored her family background, the mainspring of much of her fiction, in her 2003 memoir, ''Giving Up the Ghost''. Although she lost her religious faith at age 12, she says it left a permanent mark on her:
<blockquote>[the] real cliché, the sense of guilt. You grow up believing that you're wrong and bad. And for me, because I took what I was told really seriously, it bred a very intense habit of introspection and self-examination and a terrible severity with myself. So that nothing was ever good enough. It's like installing a policeman, and one moreover who keeps changing the law.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/sep/12/hilary-mantel-booker-prize-interview|location=London|work=[[The Guardian]]|first=Aida|last=Edemariam|title=I accumulated an anger that would rip a roof off|date=12 September 2009}}</ref></blockquote>

She attended [[Harrytown Catholic High School|Harrytown Convent school]] in [[Romiley]], Cheshire. In 1970, she began her studies at the [[London School of Economics]] to read law.<ref name=likethis/> She transferred to the [[University of Sheffield]] and graduated as Bachelor of [[Jurisprudence]] in 1973. During her university years, she was a socialist.<ref name="NYer"/>

==Early career==
After university, Mantel worked in the social work department of a [[geriatric]] hospital and then as a sales assistant in a department store.

In 1973, she married Gerald McEwen, a [[geologist]].<ref name=gentlewoman/> In 1974, she began writing a novel about the [[French Revolution]], which was published in 1992 as ''A Place of Greater Safety.'' In 1977, Mantel moved to [[Botswana]] with her husband where they lived for the next five years.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.themanbookerprize.com/people/hilary-mantel |title=Hilary Mantel |publisher=The Man Booker Prize |access-date=14 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141128125009/http://www.themanbookerprize.com/people/hilary-mantel |archive-date=28 November 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Later, they spent four years in [[Jeddah, Saudi Arabia|Jeddah]], [[Saudi Arabia]]. She published a memoir of this period in the ''[[London Review of Books]]''.

R7.</ref>

==Literary career==
Mantel's first novel, ''[[Every Day is Mother's Day]],'' was published in 1985, and its sequel, ''[[Vacant Possession (novel)|Vacant Possession]]'', a year later. After returning to England, she became the film critic of ''[[The Spectator]]'', a position she held from 1987 to 1991,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://literature.britishcouncil.org/hilary-mantel|title=Hilary Mantel - Literature|access-date=14 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212234223/http://literature.britishcouncil.org/hilary-mantel|archive-date=12 February 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> and a reviewer for a number of papers and magazines in Britain and the United States. Her novel ''[[Eight Months on Ghazzah Street]]'' (1988), which drew on her life in Saudi Arabia, uses a threatening clash of values between the neighbours in a city apartment block to explore the tensions between [[Islamic culture]] and the liberal West. Her [[Winifred Holtby Memorial Prize]]-winning novel ''[[Fludd (novel)|Fludd]]'' is set in 1956 in a fictitious northern village called Fetherhoughton, centering on a Roman Catholic church and a convent. A mysterious stranger brings about transformations in the lives of those around him.

''[[A Place of Greater Safety]]'' (1992) won the [[Sunday Express Book of the Year]] award, for which her two previous books had been shortlisted. A long and historically accurate novel, it traces the career of three French revolutionaries, [[Georges Danton|Danton]], [[Robespierre]] and [[Camille Desmoulins]], from childhood to their early deaths during the [[Reign of Terror]] of 1794.

''[[A Change of Climate]]'' (1994), set in rural [[Norfolk]], explores the lives of Ralph and Anna Eldred, as they raise their four children and devote their lives to charity. It includes chapters about their early married life as [[missionaries]] in South Africa, when they were imprisoned and deported to [[Bechuanaland]], and the tragedy that occurred there.

''[[An Experiment in Love]]'' (1996), which won the [[Hawthornden Prize]], takes place over two university terms in 1970. It follows the progress of three girls – two friends and one enemy – as they leave home and attend university in London. [[Margaret Thatcher]] makes a cameo appearance in this novel, which explores women's appetites and ambitions, and suggests how they are often thwarted. Though Mantel has used material from her own life, it is not an autobiographical novel.

Her next book, ''[[The Giant, O'Brien]]'' (1998), is set in the 1780s, and is based on the true story of [[Charles Byrne (giant)|Charles Byrne]] (or O'Brien). He came to London to earn money by displaying himself as a freak. His bones hang today in the Museum of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]]. The novel treats O'Brien and his antagonist, the Scots surgeon [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]], less as characters in history than as mythic protagonists in a dark and violent fairytale, necessary casualties of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. She adapted the book for [[BBC Radio&nbsp;4]], in a play starring [[Alex Norton]] (as Hunter) and [[Frances Tomelty]].

In 2003, Mantel published her memoir, ''Giving Up the Ghost'', which won the [[Mind (charity)|MIND]] "Book of the Year" award. That same year she brought out a collection of short stories, ''Learning To Talk''. All the stories deal with childhood and, taken together, the books show how the events of a life are mediated as fiction. Her 2005 novel, ''[[Beyond Black]]'', was shortlisted for the [[Orange Prize]]. Set in the late 1990s and early 2000s, it features a professional [[medium (spirituality)|medium]], Alison Hart, whose calm and jolly exterior conceals grotesque psychic damage. She trails around with her a troupe of "fiends", who are invisible but always on the verge of becoming flesh.

The long novel ''[[Wolf Hall]]'', about [[Henry VIII of England|Henry&nbsp;VIII]]'s minister [[Thomas Cromwell]], was published in 2009 to critical acclaim.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/sep/08/man-booker-shortlist|work=The Guardian|location=London|title=Booker Prize prize shortlist pits veteran Coetzee against bookies' favourite Mantel|first=Alison|last=Flood|date=8 September 2009|access-date=4 May 2010}}</ref> The book won that year's [[Booker Prize]] and, upon winning the award, Mantel said, "I can tell you at this moment I am happily flying through the air".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8292488.stm|work=BBC News|title=Mantel named Booker Prize winner|date=6 October 2009|access-date=4 May 2010}}</ref> Judges voted three to two in favour of ''Wolf Hall'' for the prize.

She is also working on a short non-fiction book, titled ''The Woman Who Died of Robespierre'', about the Polish playwright [[Stanisława Przybyszewska]]. Mantel also writes reviews and essays, mainly for ''[[The Guardian]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/hilary-mantel |title=Hilary Mantel {{!}} Books |website=The Guardian |access-date=26 May 2017}}</ref> the ''[[London Review of Books]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/contributors/hilary-mantel |title=Hilary Mantel · LRB |website=www.lrb.co.uk |access-date=26 May 2017}}</ref> and the ''[[New York Review of Books]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nybooks.com/contributors/hilary-mantel/ |title=Hilary Mantel |website=The New York Review of Books |access-date=26 May 2017}}</ref> ''[[The Culture Show]]'' programme on [[BBC Two]] broadcast a profile of Mantel on 17 September 2011.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0152cyz |title=Hilary Mantel: A Culture Show Special |publisher= [[BBC Two]] |access-date=19 May 2012}}</ref>

In December 2016, Mantel spoke with ''[[Kenyon Review]]'' editor David H. Lynn on the KR Podcast<ref name=KRpodcast>[https://www.kenyonreview.org/conversation/kr-podcast-with-hilary-mantel/ "KR Podcast with Hilary Mantel"], ''Kenyon Review''.</ref> about the way historical novels are published, what it is like to live in the world of one character for more than ten years, writing for the stage, and the final book in her Thomas Cromwell trilogy, ''The Mirror and the Light''.<ref name=KRpodcast />

She delivered the 2017 [[Reith Lectures]] on [[BBC Radio Four]], talking about the theme of historical fiction.

== Personal life ==
Mantel married geologist Gerald McEwen in 1973. They divorced in 1981 but remarried in 1982.<ref name=gentlewoman>{{cite magazine|last=Emina|first=Seb|date=Spring–Summer 2020|url=https://thegentlewoman.co.uk/library/hilary-mantel_4|title=Hilary Mantel {{!}} The queen of historical fiction|magazine=[[The Gentlewoman (magazine)|The Gentlewoman]]|issue=21|access-date=1 May 2021}}</ref> They live in [[Budleigh Salterton]], [[Devon]].<ref name=":0" />

===Health===
During her twenties, Mantel had a debilitating and painful illness. She was initially diagnosed with a psychiatric illness, hospitalised, and treated with [[antipsychotic drugs]], which reportedly produced [[psychosis|psychotic]] symptoms. In consequence, Mantel refrained from seeking help from doctors for some years. Finally, in [[Botswana]] and desperate, she consulted a medical textbook and realised she was probably suffering from a severe form of [[endometriosis]], a diagnosis confirmed by doctors in London. The condition and necessary surgery—a surgical menopause at the age of 27—left her unable to have children, and continued to disrupt her life. She later said "you've thought your way through questions of fertility and menopause and what it means to be without children because it all happened catastrophically". This led Mantel in her writing to see the woman's body problematised as a theme, though a shadow rather than what she wrote about constantly.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Hilary Mantel: 'Being a novelist is no fun. But fun isn't high on my list' |newspaper=The Guardian |date=4 October 2020 |access-date = 17 January 2021|url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/oct/04/hilary-mantel-wolf-hall-mantel-pieces}}</ref> Continued treatment by [[steroid]]s caused weight gain and radically changed her appearance.

== Controversies ==

=== Commentary on media portrayal of royalty ===
In a 2013 speech on media and royal women at the [[British Museum]], Mantel commented on [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge]], saying in passing that the Duchess was forced to present herself publicly as a personality-free "shop window mannequin" whose sole purpose is to deliver an heir to the throne.<ref>Sherwin, Adam. [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/hilary-mantel-attacks-bland-plastic-machinemade-duchess-of-cambridge-8500035.html "Hilary Mantel attacks 'bland, plastic, machine-made' Duchess of Cambridge"], ''The Independent'', 19 February 2013; retrieved 19 February 2013.</ref><ref name="LRB13">Mantel, Hilary. [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v35/n04/hilary-mantel/royal-bodies "Royal Bodies"], ''London Review of Books'', 35:4, 21 February 2013, p.3–7.</ref><ref>"They also took up a total of four paragraphs in a 30-paragraph speech – less than one-seventh, in other words" according to [[Hadley Freeman]] [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/19/hilary-mantel-duchess-cambridge-scandal "Hilary Mantel v the Duchess of Cambridge: a story of lazy journalism and raging hypocrisy"], ''The Guardian'', 19 February 2013.</ref> Mantel also said: "It may be that the whole phenomenon of monarchy is irrational, but that doesn't mean that when we look at it we should behave like spectators at [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|Bedlam]]. Cheerful curiosity can easily become cruelty."<ref name="LRB13" />

These remarks caused much controversy. The Leader of the Opposition [[Ed Miliband]] and Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] criticised them, while [[Jemima Khan]]<ref>Sherwin, Adam. [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/david-cameron-defends-kate-over-hilary-mantels-shopwindow-mannequin-remarks-8501237.html "David Cameron defends Kate over Hilary Mantel’s ‘shop-window mannequin’ remarks"], ''The Independent'', 19 February 2013.</ref><ref>See also Jessica Elgot [http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/02/19/hilary-mantel-on-kate-middleton-right_n_2715638.html "Hilary Mantel And 10 Reasons Why She Might Be Right About Kate Middleton"], ''The Huffington Post'', 19 February 2013.</ref> defended Mantel.

=== Thatcher controversy ===
In September 2014, in an interview published in ''The Guardian'', Mantel confessed to fantasizing about the murder of [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 1983, and fictionalized the event in a short story called "The Assassination of Margaret Thatcher: 6 August 1983". Allies of Thatcher called for a police investigation, to which Mantel sarcastically responded, "bringing in the police for an investigation was beyond anything I could have planned or hoped for, because it immediately exposes them to ridicule."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/hilary-mantel-coalition-is-more-brutal-to-poor-and-immigrants-than-thomas-cromwell-9858630.html |location=London |work=The Independent |first=Adam |last=Sherwin |title=Hilary Mantel: Coalition government more brutal to poor and immigrants than Thomas Cromwell was |date=13 November 2014}}</ref>

=== Allegations of anti-Catholicism ===
In an interview with the ''Telegraph'', Mantel stated: "I think that nowadays the Catholic Church is not an institution for respectable people."<ref name=catholic>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/9262955/Hilary-Mantel-Catholic-Church-is-not-for-respectable-people.html |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |first=Anita |last=Singh |title=Hilary Mantel: Catholic Church is not for respectable people |date=13 May 2012}}</ref> She continued in the interview to say: "When I was a child I wondered why priests and nuns were not nicer people. I thought that they were amongst the worst people I knew."  These statements, as well as the themes explored in her earlier novel ''[[Fludd (novel)|Fludd]]'', have led some to question her work in ''[[Wolf Hall]]'', with Bishop [[Mark O'Toole (bishop)|Mark O'Toole]] noting: "There is an [[anti-Catholic]] thread there, there is no doubt about it. ''Wolf Hall'' is not neutral."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.catholicireland.net/concern-anti-catholic-bias-bbcs-wolf-hall/|title=Concern over anti catholic bias in BBC's Wolf Hall - Catholicireland.net |date=6 February 2015}}</ref>
