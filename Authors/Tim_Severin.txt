==Personal life and career==
He was born Giles Timothy Watkins in 1940 to Maurice and Inge Watkins in [[Jorhat]], [[Assam]], India, where his father managed a tea plantation.<ref name="NYTobit">{{cite news |last1=Sandomir |first1=Richard |title=Tim Severin, Seafarer Who Replicated Explorers’ Journeys, Dies at 80 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/02/obituaries/tim-severin-dead.html |access-date=17 January 2021 |work=New York Times |date=4 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210106014137/https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/02/obituaries/tim-severin-dead.html|archive-date=6 January 2021}}</ref> Educated in England from age 7, he attended [[Tonbridge School]] and studied geography and history at [[Keble College, Oxford]]. He adopted the name Severin to honour his maternal grandmother, who cared for him in his youth.<ref name="NYTobit" />

Severin married twice. His first wife was Dorothy Sherman,  a specialist in medieval Spanish literature; that marriage ended in divorce. He later married Dee Pieters.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Macleod |first1=Maxwell |title=Obiturary: Adventurer who rebuilt ancient craft to retrace epic, historic routes |work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] | url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/19110718.obituary-tim-severin-adventurer-rebuilt-ancient-craft-retrace-epic-historic-routes/ |issue=23 February 2021 |pages=20}}</ref>

==Recreating ancient voyages==

===Tracking Marco Polo (1961)===
While he was an [[undergraduate]] at [[Oxford University]], Severin, [[Stanley Johnson (writer)|Stanley Johnson]] and [[Michael de Larrabeiti]] retraced [[Marco Polo]]'s thirteenth-century journey through Asia on motorcycles, using Polo's ''The Description of the World'' as a guide. They travelled from [[Oxford]] via [[Switzerland]] to [[Venice]], through [[Turkey]], [[Persia]] and [[Afghanistan]], surviving [[sandstorm]]s, floods, motorcycle accidents, and time spent in jail. Severin and his guides rode camels through the [[Deh Bakri]] pass to identify the Persian "apples of Paradise" and the hidden hot springs described by Polo. They were unable to complete the voyage due to visa problems at the border of China and returned to England by sea from [[Bombay]].{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

===Explorers of the Mississippi (1967)===
From [[conquistadors]] to nineteenth-century gentlemen explorers, Severin follows the routes and tells the stories of the adventurers who have travelled along the US river the [[Mississippi]] for hundreds of years, and does so while navigating the length of the river by canoe and [[Launch (boat)|launch]].

===The Brendan Voyage (1976–1977)===
It is theorized by some scholars, that the [[Latin]] texts of ''Navigatio Sancti Brendani Abbatis'' (The Voyage of [[St Brendan]] the Abbot) dating back to at least 800 AD tell the story of Brendan's (c. 489–583) seven-year voyage across the Atlantic Ocean to a new land and his return. Convinced that the legend was based in historical truth, in 1976 Severin built a replica of Brendan's [[currach]]. Handcrafted using traditional tools, the 36-foot (11 m), two-masted boat was built of Irish [[Fraxinus excelsior|ash]] and [[oak]], hand-lashed together with nearly two miles (3&nbsp;km) of leather thong, wrapped with 49 traditionally tanned ox hides, and sealed with wool grease.

On May 17, 1976 Severin and his crew (George Maloney, Arthur Magan, Trondo Paerson) sailed from [[Tralee]] in Ireland's [[County Kerry]]<ref>"5 Set Out From Tralee For U.S. in Open Boat", ''The New York Times'', May 18, 1976, p. 3</ref> on the ''Brendan'', and, over more than 13 months, traveled 4,500 miles (7,200&nbsp;km), arriving at Canada on June 24, 1977, near [[Wadham Islands|Peckford Island]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], where it was stopped by adverse winds.  The boat was sighted, rescued and towed the remaining 60 miles to [[Musgrave Harbour]] by the Canadian Coast Guard vessel CCGS ''John Cabot''.<ref>"Columbus retains his fame", AP report in ''Lafayette (IN) Journal and Courier'', June 25, 1977</ref> Severin told reporters, "We've proved that a leather boat can cross the North Atlantic by a route that few modern yachtsmen would attempt.".<ref>"Leather Boat Sailors Reach Canada", ''Victoria (BC) Times Colonist'', June 27, 1977, p. 1</ref>  Along the way, they had stopped at the [[Hebrides]], the [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Iceland]] (where they spent the winter until departing again on May 11) en route. He considered that his recreation of the voyage helped to identify the bases for many of the legendary elements of the story: the "Island of Sheep", the "Paradise of Birds", "Crystal Towers", "mountains that hurled rocks at voyagers", and the "Promised Land". Severin's account of the expedition, ''The Brendan Voyage'', became an international best seller, translated into 16 languages.

The boat is now featured at the [[Craggaunowen]] open-air museum in [[County Clare]], Ireland.

===The Sindbad Voyage (1980–1981)===
The famous adventures of the medieval sailor [[Sindbad]], as recorded in ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', became the inspiration for Severin's next voyage. After three years of researching the legend and early Arab and Persian sketches of medieval ships, he brought the project to [[Sur, Oman|Sur]], Oman in 1980. Sponsored by [[Qaboos bin Said al Said]], [[List of rulers of Oman|Sultan of Oman]], he guided Omani shipwrights in the construction of the "Sohar", an 87-foot (26.5 m) replica of a ninth-century, lateen-rigged, cotton-sailed [[Arab]] [[dhow]]. The ship was constructed in seven months of hand-sawn wooden planks sewn together with nearly 400 miles (640&nbsp;km) of hand-rolled, coconut-husk rope.

''Sohar'' left [[Oman]] on 21 November 1980. Navigating by the stars, Severin and his crew of 25 travelled nearly 6,000 miles (9,600&nbsp;km) in eight months. From [[Muscat, Oman|Sur]] they sailed east across the [[Arabian Sea]], south down India's [[Malabar Coast]] to [[Lakshadweep]] and on to [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], India. The next phase of their voyage took them down the coast of India to [[Sri Lanka]]. From Galle they sailed across the Indian Ocean,  on route they were becalmed in the [[doldrums]] for nearly a month, suffered broken spars, and were nearly run down by freighters, but arrived in Sabang on 1th 17 April, then down the Malacca Straist to Malacca and Singapore arriving 1 June, then the to  [[Guangzhou]], China on 6 July.

===The Jason Voyage (1984)===
The epic poem ''[[Argonautica]]'', first written down by [[Apollonius of Rhodes]] in [[Alexandria]] in the late 3rd century BC, became the basis for Severin's next expedition. He began his research into ancient Greek ships and the details of the text in 1981. Master shipwright Vasilis Delimitros of [[Spetses]] hand built a 54-foot (16.5 m) replica of a [[Bronze Age]] [[galley]] based on a scale model of the ''[[Argo]]''. In 1984, with twenty volunteer oarsmen, Severin rowed and sailed from northern [[Greece]] through the [[Dardanelles]], crossed the [[Marmara Sea]], and passed through the Straits of [[Bosphorus]] to the [[Black Sea]], reaching the [[Phasis River|Phasis delta]] in then-[[Georgian SSR|Soviet Georgia]]: a voyage of 1,500 miles (2,400&nbsp;km). Along the way they identified some of the landmarks visited by [[Jason]] and his Argonauts, and found a possible explanation for the legend of the [[Golden Fleece]]. Severin recounted the expedition in ''The Jason Voyage'' (1985).

===The Ulysses Voyage (1985)===
Once again making use of the ''Argo'' from ''The Jason Voyage'', in 1985 Severin followed the route of [[Odysseus|Ulysses]]' voyage home in ''The [[Odyssey]]'', from [[Troy]] to [[Ithaca]] in the [[Ionian islands]]. Along the way, Severin made tentative or conclusive identifications of The land of the [[Lotus-eaters]], [[King Nestor]]'s palace, the Halls of Hades, the [[Planctae|Roving Rocks]], [[Scylla]] and [[Charybdis]], and also the sirens. ''The Ulysses Voyage'', published in 1987, tells the story of the expedition, the historical research that went into it, and the discoveries Severin and his crew made along the way.

===By Horse to Jerusalem (1987/88)===
Nine hundred years after the [[First Crusade]], Tim Severin and Sarah Dormon set out on horseback to follow the 2500 mile route of Duke [[Godfrey of Bouillon|Godfrey of Boullion]] and other Crusaders from Belgium to [[Jerusalem]], travelling through the modern lands of Germany, Austria, Hungary, Yugoslavia (itself today consigned to history), Bulgaria, Turkey and Syria. The horses chosen were a riding school palfrey (Mystery) and a Heavy Ardennes (Carty), the latter a descendant of the war horses of Crusader cavalry – what Severin called ‘the Main Battle Tank’ of its day. This journey, after many years of marine expeditions was a return to long distance land exploration by Severin. The Journey would take place over 2 years with the horses and riders resting over the winter of 1987/8.  Severin was unable to follow exactly the route of Duke Godfrey due to the [[Lebanese Civil War|civil war in the Lebanon]], instead routing through Syria and Jordan to reach Jerusalem.

===In Search of Genghis Khan (1990)===
While still a student at the [[University of Oxford]], Severin wrote his thesis on the first European travellers in Central Asia during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. With this background, to commemorate the 800th birthday of [[Genghis Khan]] he rode with [[Mongol]] herdsmen along the route once used by couriers of the Mongolian empire, mingled with [[camel]] herders in the [[Gobi Desert]], and ate with [[Kazakhs]] in their [[yurts]]. His story, part [[Travel literature|travelogue]], part research paper, was published in 1993 under the title ''In Search of Genghis Khan''.

===The China Voyage (May–November 1993)===
Ancient Chinese texts tell the story of [[Xu Fu|Hsu Fu]], a navigator and explorer sent by the first Emperor of China, [[Qin Shi Huang]], in 218 BC into the "Eastern Ocean" in search of life-prolonging drugs. Hsu Fu completed the voyage on a [[bamboo]] raft, which some believe took him to America and back.

Severin set out to prove that such a voyage could have been made. On the beach at [[Sam Son]], [[Vietnam]], he oversaw the construction of a 60-foot (18.3 m) long, 15-foot (4.6 m) wide raft built of 220 bamboos and [[rattan]] cording, and driven by an 800 square foot (74 square metre), junk-rigged sail. After leaving Asia in May 1993, Severin and his crew faced [[monsoons]], [[pirates]] and [[typhoons]] before the [[rattan]] began rotting and the raft began falling apart in the mid-Pacific. After travelling 5,500 miles (8,850&nbsp;km) in 105 days, they were forced to abandon the raft about 1,000 miles (1,600&nbsp;km) short of their destination.

Although the ''Hsu Fu'', as the craft was named, did not complete the trip, Severin believed the voyage had accomplished its purpose. In ''The China Voyage'', published in 1994, he wrote that the expedition had proved that a [[bamboo]] raft of the second century BC could have made a voyage across the Pacific, just as Hsu Fu's account recorded.

===In Search of Moby Dick: Quest for the White Whale (1999)===
Following the path of the ''[[Pequod (Moby-Dick)|Pequod]]'', Severin sets out to find a living, white [[sperm whale]]. His quest takes him to the remotest parts of the South Pacific: the [[Philippine]] island of [[Pamilacan]], whose people hunt [[whale sharks]] with their hands and grappling hooks and the Indonesian island of [[Lembata|Lamalera]], whose people hunt [[sperm whales]] with [[harpoon]]s from open boats. Throughout his expedition, Severin was able to compare [[Herman Melville|Melville]]'s account with the reality he discovers, and to show that much of Melville's material was either borrowed or fabricated.

==Fiction==
Severin also wrote historical fiction. The ''Viking Series'', first published in 2005, concerns a young Viking adventurer who travels the world. In 2007 he published ''The Adventures of Hector Lynch'' series, set in the late 17th century, about a 17-year-old [[Privateer|Corsair]].
