A former ballet and [[jazz dancer]], Catherine Asaro has performed with dance companies and in musicals on both coasts and in Ohio. She founded and served as artistic director and a principal dancer for two dance groups at Harvard: The Mainly Jazz Dance Company and the Harvard University Ballet. After she graduated, her undergraduate students took over Mainly Jazz and made it into a club at the college.

She has completed two terms as president of [[Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America]] (SFWA) (2003–2005) and during her tenure established the [[Andre Norton Award]] for Young Adult Science Fiction and Fantasy.<ref name="SIGMA" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfwa.org/tag/andre-norton-award/ |title=Andre Norton Award Archives |publisher=SFWA |access-date=2015-07-23}}</ref>

Catherine Asaro is the daughter of [[Frank Asaro]], the nuclear chemist who discovered the [[iridium anomaly]] that led the team of [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]], [[Walter Alvarez]], Frank Asaro, and [[Helen Vaughn Michel|Helen Michel]] to postulate that an asteroid collided with the Earth 66 million years ago and caused mass extinctions, including the demise of the dinosaurs.

== Saga of the Skolian Empire series ==
{{Main|Saga of the Skolian Empire}}
The Saga of the Skolian Empire, informally called the Skolian Saga, is a series of science fiction novels, [[Novella|novelette]]s and novellas revolving around characters from an interstellar empire known as the [[Skolian Empire]] and their power struggle with the rival [[Eubian Concord]]. The plot of the book unfolds over several generations of characters and revolves around political intrigues, but also contains subplots regarding [[Romance novel|romance]], [[physics]], [[Cyborgs in fiction|bio-enhancements]], and virtual [[computer networks]].

== Mathematical fiction and hard science fiction==
Asaro is known as a [[hard science fiction]] writer for the scientific depth of her work. The amount of science varies from book to book, with novels such as ''[[Primary Inversion]]'', ''[[The Radiant Seas]]'', and ''[[Spherical Harmonic]]'' on the most scientifically dense end of the spectrum, including elements such as equations and diagrams of [[quantum mechanical]] [[wave functions]] and [[Klein bottles]]. [[Stanley Schmidt]], the long time editor of ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Analog]]'' magazine, wrote that ''[[Primary Inversion]]'' is "an impressive first novel; not just a good story, but the kind of speculation we too seldom see – really new science that just might be possible." Asaro is noted as one of the few female science fiction writers who also has a doctorate in hard science, in Asaro's case a PhD from Harvard in theoretical Chemical Physics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bst.sagepub.com/content/17/4/207.1.extract |title=Projecting the Shadow: The Cyborg Hero in American Film, Janice Hocker Rushing and Thomas S. Frentz. 1995. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago, IL. 256 pages. $45.00 hc; $14.95 pb |publisher=Bst.sagepub.com |date=1997-08-01 |access-date=2015-07-23}}</ref>

Asaro is also noted for including sophisticated mathematical concepts in her fiction. The method of space travel used in the Skolian Empire books comes from a paper Asaro wrote on complex variables and special relativity that appeared in the ''[[American Journal of Physics]]''.<ref>Am. J. Phys, 64 (4), April 1996, 421</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physicscentral.org/explore/people/asaro.cfm |title=Catherine Asaro |publisher=Physicscentral.org |date=2014-04-11 |access-date=2015-07-23}}</ref> The novel ''[[Spherical Harmonic]]'' involves an imagined universe based on the [[Hilbert space]] described by the [[spherical harmonic]] [[eigenfunction]]s that solve the [[Laplace Equation]], and some prose in the book is written in the shape of the [[sinusoidal]] waves found in the spherical harmonics.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aWeU6J5ApM0C&q=%22spherical+harmonic%22 |title=Spherical Harmonic: A Novel in the Saga of the Skolian Empire - Catherine Asaro |date= April 2007|access-date=2015-07-23|isbn=9781429970488 |last1=Asaro |first1=Catherine }}</ref> Her novel ''[[The Quantum Rose]]'' is an allegory to [[quantum]] [[scattering theory]] and is dedicated to her doctoral advisors and mentors in the subject, [[Alex Dalgarno]], [[Kate Kirby]], and [[Eric J. Heller]].<ref>[http://www.thehachiko.com/node/4138 Thehachiko.com]{{dead link|date=July 2015}}{{cbignore}}</ref> The novella "Aurora in Four Voices" includes topics ranging from [[Fourier series]] to integration problems in [[calculus]]. In essays in the back of some of her novels, Asaro explains the mathematical and physics basis of the ideas used in the books, in particular ''Spherical Harmonic,'' ''[[The Quantum Rose]],'' and ''The Moon's Shadow.'' In the anthology ''Aurora in Four Voices'' (which includes the novella of the same name), Asaro describes the mathematical basis of several stories in the anthology, including the use of Fourier transforms, [[Riemann surface|Riemann sheets]], and complex numbers in "The SpaceTime Pool."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B4vC2i_6N7mYb0Q5N1BKRkpTb1dJLUhLdEpBQzVwQQ |title=Math Essay Updated March 2012.pdf - Google Drive |access-date=2015-07-23}}</ref>

== Musical collaborations ==
=== The Diamond Star Project ===
The Diamond Star Project is a [[collaboration]] between Catherine Asaro and the rock musicians [[Point Valid]]. The project resulted in a CD, ''Diamond Star'' (Starflight Music, April 2009), which is a "soundtrack" for the book, ''Diamond Star'' ([[Baen Books]]). The novel tells the story of Del-Kurj, a Ruby Dynasty prince who would rather be a rock singer than sit on the throne. The lyrics to the songs appear in the novel ''Diamond Star'' and were the inspiration for the CD.<ref name = "FFTV">{{cite web|url=http://fast-forward.tv/blog/?p=320 |title=Blog – Fast Forward: Contemporary Science Fiction |publisher=Fast-forward.tv |access-date=2015-07-23}}</ref>

[[File:PointValidWithCatherineAsaro2008.jpg|thumb|Point Valid with Catherine Asaro (2008)|right]]

Point Valid is an alternative band originating in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], with Hayim Ani on vocals and guitar, Adam Leve on drums and Max Vidaver on guitar. Ani wrote most of the music for the CD, and Asaro wrote most of the lyrics, as well as music for three songs. Ani also contributed three original compositions, both music and lyrics. Most of the vocals are by Ani, with a few by Asaro. The CD has twelve songs, eleven originals and a cover of "[[The Sounds of Silence|Sound of Silence]]". Asaro, who did not know how to sing, took voice lessons in preparation for the recordings, and continues to train and perform. Asaro has described how the collaboration inspired her work, as exemplified by the song "Emeralds", which she was not able to finish until she and Ani were in the studio recording his vocals.<ref name="io9" />

During 2009, the Diamond Star Project expanded to include [[Donald Wolcott]], a jazz pianist who accompanied Asaro in concerts.<ref name="io9">{{cite web |url=http://io9.com/5236410/catherine-asaro-rocks-out-for-her-latest-science-fiction-epic |title=Catherine Asaro Rocks Out For Her Latest Science Fiction Epic |author=Alasdair Wilkins |date=May 1, 2009 |access-date=May 4, 2009 |publisher=io9.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nebulaawards.com/index.php/interview/catherine_asaro_2009/ |title=Catherine Asaro 2009 Interview |author=Charles Tan |date=April 22, 2009 |access-date=May 5, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427093557/http://www.nebulaawards.com/index.php/interview/catherine_asaro_2009/ |archive-date=April 27, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref> In 2010, Starflight Music released the EP ''Goodbye Note'' by Asaro and Wolcott, which includes the song "No Answers with in Paradisum" from the ''Diamond Star'' soundtrack, rewritten and sung by Asaro.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/AsaroandWolcott|title=Asaro and Wolcott &#124; Goodbye Note &#124; CD Baby Music Store|publisher=Cdbaby.com|access-date=2015-07-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228165924/http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/AsaroandWolcott|archive-date=December 28, 2010|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In 2010, Marty Pell joined the Diamond Star Project as an additional pianist,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150097897903208&set=a.10150189928768208.313366.33623623207 |title=Catherine Asaro - Various appearances 2011 |publisher=Facebook |date=2011-02-24 |access-date=2015-07-23}}</ref> and in 2011, Greg Adams replaced Wolcott as Asaro's primary accompanist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isfic.org/program_books/Windycon38.pdf |title=We live in a society exquisitely dependent on science and technology in which hardly anyone knows anything about science and technology |author=Carl Sagan |publisher=Isfic.org |access-date=2015-07-24}}</ref>
