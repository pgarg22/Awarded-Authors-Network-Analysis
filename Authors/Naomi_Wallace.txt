In 2015, Wallace received an [https://writersworkshop.uiowa.edu/resources/news/american-academy-arts-letters-awards-naomi-wallace-and-zachary-lazar Arts and Letters Award] in Literature from the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]].  The award citation reads:  "Naomi Wallace is a powerful and essential voice who brings to the theater great lyricism and moral courage.  Her characters, so cruelly treated and often destroyed, speak with a direct and devastating poetry.  Never does this dramatist mollify or fail to engage us on the deepest level, and her three "Visions" of the Middle East that comprise  ''The Fever Chart'' are short, stark masterworks."

==Work==
