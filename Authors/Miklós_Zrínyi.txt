'''Nikola VII Zrinski''' ({{lang-hr|Nikola Zrinski}}, {{lang-hu|Zrínyi Miklós}}; 5 January 1620 – 18 November 1664) was a [[Croats|Croatian]] and [[Magyars|Hungarian]] military leader, statesman and poet.

==Biography==
Miklós was born in Csáktornya, [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (now [[Čakovec]], [[Croatia]])<ref>Szeberényi, Gábor:  Zala és Somogy megye a Dráván túl. Megjegyzések a szlavóniai igazgatástörténet Árpád-kori rekonstrukciójának néhány kérdéséhez. In: ''A IX. Medievisztikai PhD-konferencia Szeged, 2015. június 17 -19. előadásai''. [[University of Szeged]], p. 324.</ref> to the Croatian [[Juraj V Zrinski]] and the Hungarian Magdolna (Magdalena) [[Széchy]]. At the court of [[Péter Pázmány]], he was an enthusiastic student of Hungarian language and literature, although he prioritized military training. From 1635 to 1637, he accompanied Szenkviczy, one of the [[Canon (priest)|canons]] of [[Esztergom]], on a long educative tour through the [[Italian Peninsula]].

[[Image:Arolsen Klebeband 02 337.jpg|thumb|left|Contemporary drawing showing Miklós Zrínyi in battle against Ottomans.]]
Over the next few years, he learned the art of war in defending the [[Military Frontier|Croatian]] frontier against the [[Ottoman Empire]], and proved himself one of the most important commanders of the age. In 1645, during the closing stages of the [[Thirty Years' War]], he acted against the [[Swedish Empire|Swedish]] troops in [[Moravia]], equipping an army corps at his own expense. At [[Skalica|Szakolcza]] he scattered a Swedish division and took 2,000&nbsp;prisoners. At [[Eger]] he saved the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand III]], who had been surprised at night in his camp by the offensive of [[Carl Gustaf Wrangel]]. Although not enthusiastic for having to fight against Hungarians of Transylvania, subsequently he routed the army of [[George I Rákóczi]], prince of [[Transylvania]], on the Upper [[Tisza]]. For his services, the emperor appointed him captain of Croatia. On his return from the war he married the wealthy Eusebia [[House of Drašković|Drašković]].

In 1646 he distinguished himself in the actions against Ottomans. At the coronation of [[Ferdinand IV of Hungary|Ferdinand IV of Austria]], [[King of the Germans]], [[King of Hungary]], [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Croatia]] and [[King of Bohemia|Bohemia]], he carried the [[sword of state]], and was made [[Ban (title)|ban]] and captain-general of Croatia. In this double capacity he presided over many Croatian diets.

During 1652–1653, Zrínyi was continually fighting against the Ottomans – nevertheless, from his castle at Csáktornya ([[Čakovec]]) he was in constant communication with the intellectual figures of his time; the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] scholar, [[Jacobus Tollius]], even visited him, and has left in his ''Epistolae itinerariae'' a lively account of his experiences. Tollius was amazed at the linguistic resources of Zrínyi, who spoke [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[German language|German]], [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] and [[Latin]] with equal ease. Zrínyi's Latin letters (from which it was gathered that he was married a second time, to Sophia Löbl) are, according to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]'' of 1911, "fluent and agreeable, but largely interspersed with Croatian and Magyar expressions". In a Latin letter from 1658 to friend Ivan Ručić expressed his consciousness of being an ethnic Croat and Zrinski ("Ego mihi conscius aliter sum, etenim non degenerem me Croatam et quidem Zrinium esse scio").<ref name="Bobory2009">{{cite book|author=Dóra Bobory|title=The Sword and the Crucible.

In 1655, he made an attempt to be elected Palatine of Hungary (''nádor''); in spite of support by the [[petty nobility]], his efforts failed. The king, reacting to Zrínyi's good connections to Protestants and the Hungarians of Transylvania, nominated [[Ferenc Wesselényi]] instead.<ref>[http://mek.niif.hu/00300/00355/html/ABC17155/17363.htm Zrínyi Miklós, gróf], Magyar életrajzi lexikon</ref>

==Activities in 1664==
The last year of his life was also a culmination of his efforts and prestige. In 1663, the Turkish army, led by Grand Vizier [[Köprülü Fazıl Ahmed|Köprülü Ahmed]], launched an overwhelming offensive against Royal Hungary, ultimately aiming at the siege and occupation of Vienna. The imperial army failed to put up any notable resistance; the Turkish army was eventually stopped by adverse weather conditions. As a preparation for the new Turkish onslaught due next year, German troops were recruited from the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and aid was called from [[France]], and Zrínyi, under the overall command of the Italian [[Raimondo Montecuccoli]], leader of the Imperial army, was named commander-in-chief of the Hungarian army.

[[File:Nicholas Zrinski crop.jpg|thumb|Engraving of Zrínyi]]
As a preparation for campaigns planned for 1664, Zrínyi set out to destroy the strongly fortified [[Suleiman Bridge]] (the ''[[Osijek]] ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: Eszék) bridge'') which, since 1566, had linked [[Darda, Croatia|Darda]] to [[Osijek]] (across the [[Drava]] and the marshes of [[Baranya (county)|Baranya]]).<ref>{{cite book|title=Yugoslav review|year=1979|edition=9th|publisher=Jugoslovenska Revija|page=41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rV_pAAAAMAAJ&q=Zrinski}}</ref> Destruction of the bridge would cut off the retreat of the [[Military of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Army]] and make any Turkish reinforcement impossible for several months. Re-capturing strong fortresses (Berzence, Babócsa, the town of [[Pécs]], etc.) on his way, Zrínyi advanced 240 kilometers on enemy territory and destroyed the bridge on 1 February 1664. However, the further pursuance of the campaign was frustrated by the refusal of the [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] generals to co-operate. The court remained suspicious of Zrínyi all the way, regarding him as a promoter of Hungarian secessionist ideas and accusing him of having disturbed the peace by building his castle, [[Novi Zrin]] ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: ''Új-Zrínyivár'' or ''Zrínyi-Újvár'', [[English language|English]]: ''[[Zrin Castle|New Zrin]]'' or ''Zrin-Newcastle''), erected in 1661 at his own expense, in the theoretically de-militarised zone between the two empires. Zrínyi's siege of [[Kanije Province, Ottoman Empire|Kanizsa]], the most important Turkish fortress in Southern Hungary, failed, as the beginning of the siege was seriously delayed by machinations of the overly jealous Montecuccoli, and later the Emperor's military commanders (apart from Hungarian and Croatian leaders), unwilling to combat the Grand Vizier's army hastily coming to the aid of Kanizsa, retreated.<ref name="autogenerated1">Sándor Szilágyi: ''A magyar nemzet története''</ref>

Despite the failed siege, the expedition made his name famous and praised throughout Europe. According to the 1911 ''Britannica'', "it was said that only the Zrínyis had the secret of conquering the Turks". [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold]] offered him the title of prince, while [[Pope]] [[Pope Alexander VII|Alexander VII]] struck a commemorative medal with the effigy of Zrínyi as a [[field marshal]], the [[King of Spain|Spanish King]] [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] sent him the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]], and [[France]]'s [[King of France|King]] [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] created him a [[Peerage of France|Peer]].

[[File:Zrínyi halála.jpg|thumb|Contemporary drawing showing the death of Zrínyi on 18 November 1664.]]
After relieving Kanizsa, the Grand Vizier turned against [[Novi Zrin]]. The Imperial troops under [[Raimondo Montecuccoli]] remained inactive while Zrínyi hastened to relieve the castle, refusing all assistance, with the result that the fortress fell. The Viennese court concentrated all its troops on the Hungarian-Austrian border, sacrificing Novi Zrin to hold back the Turkish army. The Turkish army, ultimately, was stopped in the [[Battle of Szentgotthárd|Battle of Saint Gotthard (1664)]]. The Turkish defeat could have offered an opportunity for Hungary to be liberated from the Turkish yoke. However, the Habsburg court chose not to push its advantage in order to save its strength for the brewing conflict that would come to be known as the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. The infamous [[Peace of Vasvár]] was negotiated by Zrínyi's adversary, Montecuccoli. The peace treaty laid down unfavourable terms, not only giving up recent conquests, but also offering a tribute to the [[Sublime Porte]] (which would never be paid) against a few presents from the Ottomans - all despite the fact that Austrian-Hungarian troops maintained the upper hand.<ref>''The enemy at the gate'', Wheatcroft</ref>

Zrínyi rushed to [[Vienna]] to protest against the treaty, but his view was ignored; he left the city in disgust, after assuring the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] minister, Sagridino, that he was willing at any moment to assist the Republic against the Ottoman Empire with 6,000 men. Zrínyi then returned to Csáktornya ([[Čakovec]]). It is widely accepted that he, despite being a loyal supporter of the court before, participated in launching the conspiracy which later became known as the [[Wesselényi conspiracy]], aimed at the restoration of the independent Kingdom of Croatia and Kingdom of Hungary.<ref>[http://www.mult-kor.hu/cikk.php?article=13147 Múlt-kor történelmi portál<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, on November 18, he was killed in a hunting accident in a place called Kursanecz (today Kuršanec, Croatia), by a wounded wild boar. To this day, rumors persist that he was killed at the order of the Habsburg Court. No conclusive evidence has ever been found to support this claim; however, it remains true that the Habsburgs lost their mightiest adversary with his death. The village where he died was renamed ''Zrínyifalva'' in Hungarian to commemorate him.

Beside being a leading military figure of 17th-century Croatia and Hungary, Zrínyi is well known for his literary works, also reflected in his often-recited epithet ''Zrínyi Miklós, a költő hadvezér és politikus'' (Hungarian for ''Miklós Zrínyi, the poet the general and the politician''). He is the author of the first epic poem in [[Hungarian literature]].<ref name="britannica.com"/>

[[File:Zrínyi Miklós.jpg|thumb|A statue of Miklós Zrínyi at the Hadtorteneti Muzeum (War History Museum) in Budapest]]

Zrínyi's most significant literary work, The ''[[Peril of Sziget]]'' (''Szigeti veszedelem'' or ''Zrínyiász''), an epic poem written in the [[Göcsej]] dialect of Hungarian, was written in the winter of 1648–1649, and was published, together with a few miscellaneous pieces of poetry, under the title of ''The [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]] of the [[Adriatic Sea]]'' (''Adriai tengernek Syrenája'') in Vienna in 1651. The epic was composed in the manner of the classic epic poets, such as [[Virgil]] and their 16th century successor [[Torquato Tasso]].

The subject is the heroic but unsuccessful [[Battle of Szigetvár|defence of Szigetvár]] by the author's great-grandfather, [[Nikola IV Zrinski]] ({{lang-hu|Zrínyi Miklós (hadvezér)}}). Many criticized the indiscriminate use of foreign words and seemingly careless [[Meter (poetry)|metres]] of the work; however, it was also much praised for its poetic strength, which made Zrínyi the most notable Hungarian poet of the 17th century. The work also earned him praise due to its fundamental idea (the strength of Hungarian/Croatian valour to overthrow Ottoman rule, with the help of God), and to its enthusiastic tone. The Peril of Sziget has drawn comparisons with the other [[Baroque literature|Baroque]] epics of the period and despite its obsolete language being difficult to interpret to the average reader remains, to this day, one of the few pre-19th century Hungarian literary works still widely known to the public. The epic was translated to Croatian by Miklós's brother, [[Petar Zrinski]] ({{lang-hu|Zrínyi Péter}}) who, while Miklós was a master of Hungarian, excelled in Croatian.

Beside his poetic works, Zrínyi is also a forerunner of Croatian and Hungarian political thinking and military science. In his essays and manifestos, such as ''Ne bántsd a magyart – Az török áfium ellen való orvosság'' (''Do not hurt the Hungarians - An antidote to the Turkish poison'') or ''Mátyás király életéről való elmélkedések'' (''Reflections on the life of King Matthias'') he makes a case for a standing army, moral renewal of the nation, the re-establishment of the national kingdom, the unification of Royal Hungary with Transylvania, and, of course, the ousting of the Turkish occupants.<ref>István Sőtér ed., A magyar irodalom története 1600-tól 1772-ig - Prózai művei</ref>
