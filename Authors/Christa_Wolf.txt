==Biography==
Wolf was born the daughter of Otto and Herta Ihlenfeld, in [[Gorzów Wielkopolski|Landsberg an der Warthe]], then in the [[Province of Brandenburg]];<ref name=guardobit/> the city is now Gorzów Wielkopolski, Poland. After [[World War II]], her family, being Germans, were [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|expelled]] from their home on what had become Polish territory. They crossed the new [[Oder-Neisse line|Oder-Neisse border]] in 1945 and settled in [[Mecklenburg]], in what would become the [[German Democratic Republic]], or East Germany. She studied literature at the [[University of Jena]] and the [[University of Leipzig]]. After her graduation, she worked for the German Writers' Union and became an editor for a publishing company. While working as an editor for publishing companies ''Verlag Neues Leben'' and ''Mitteldeutscher Verlag'' and as a literary critic for the journal ''Neue deutsche Literatur'', Wolf was provided contact with antifascists and Communists, many of whom had either returned from exile or from imprisonment in concentration camps. Her writings discuss political, economic, and scientific power, making her an influential spokesperson in East and West Germany during post-World War II for the empowerment of individuals to be active within the industrialized and patriarchal society.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Frederiksen|first1=Elke P.|last2=Ametsbichler|first2=Elizabeth G.|title=Women Writers in German-Speaking Countries: A Bio-Bibliographical Critical Sourcebook|date=1998|publisher=Greenwood Press|pages=485, 486}}</ref>

She joined the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] (SED) in 1949 and left it in June 1989, six months before the Communist regime collapsed. She was a candidate member of the Central Committee of the SED from 1963 to 1967. [[Stasi]] records found in 1993 showed that she worked as an informant (''Inoffizieller Mitarbeiter'') during the years 1959–61.<ref name=telegobit/> The Stasi officers criticized what they called her "reticence", and they lost interest in her cooperation. She was herself then closely watched for nearly 30 years. During the [[Cold War]], Wolf was openly critical of the leadership of the GDR, but she maintained a loyalty to the values of socialism and opposed [[German reunification]].<ref name=dwobit/>

In 1961, she published ''Moskauer Novelle'' (''Moscow Novella''). Wolf's breakthrough as a writer came in 1963 with the publication of ''[[Der geteilte Himmel]]'' (''Divided Heaven'', ''They Divided the Sky'').<ref name="spiegel-obit"/> Her subsequent works included ''Nachdenken über Christa T.'' (''[[The Quest for Christa T.]]'') (1968), ''Kindheitsmuster'' (''[[Patterns of Childhood]]'') (1976), ''[[Kein Ort. Nirgends]]'' (''No Place on Earth'') (1979), ''[[Cassandra (novel)|Kassandra]]'' (''Cassandra'') (1983), ''Störfall'' (''Accident'') (1987), ''Medea'' (1996), ''Auf dem Weg nach Tabou'' (''[[On the Way to Taboo]]'') (1994), and ''Stadt der Engel oder The Overcoat of Dr. Freud'' (2010) (''[[City of Angels or The Overcoat of Dr. Freud]]'').  ''Christa T'' was a work that—while briefly touching on a disconnection from one's family's ancestral home—was concerned with a woman's experiencing overwhelming societal pressure to conform.

''[[Cassandra (novel)|Kassandra]]'' is perhaps Wolf's most important book, re-interpreting the [[battle of Troy]] as a war for economic power and a shift from a matriarchal to a patriarchal society. ''Was bleibt'' (''[[What Remains (novella)|What Remains]]''), described her life under Stasi surveillance, was written in 1979, but not published until 1990.  ''Auf dem Weg nach Tabou'' (1995; translated as ''Parting from Phantoms'') gathered essays, speeches, and letters written during the four years following the [[German reunification|reunification of Germany]]. ''Leibhaftig'' (2002) describes a woman struggling with life and death in 1980s East-German hospital, while awaiting medicine from the West. Central themes in her work are German fascism, humanity, feminism, and self-discovery. In many of her works, Wolf uses illness as a metaphor. In a speech addressed to the ''Deutsche Krebsgesellschaft'' (German Cancer Society) she says, "How we choose to speak or not to speak about illnesses such as cancer mirrors our misgivings about society." In "Nachdenken über Christa T." (The Quest for Christa T), the protagonist dies of leukemia. This work demonstrates the dangers and consequences that happen to an individual when they internalize society's contradictions. In ''Accident'', the narrator's brother is undergoing surgery to remove a brain tumor a few days after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster had occurred.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Costabile-Heming|first1=Carol Anne|title=Illness as Metaphor: Christa Wolf, the GDR, and Beyond|journal=Symposium|date=1 September 2010|volume=64|issue=3|page=203|doi=10.1080/00397709.2010.502485|s2cid=142994254}}</ref> In 2004, she edited and published her correspondence with her UK-based near namesake [[Charlotte Wolff]] over the years 1983–1986 (Wolf, Christa and Wolff, Charlotte (2004) ''Ja, unsere Kreise berühren sich: Briefe'', [[Luchterhand Literaturverlag|Luchterhand]] Munich).

==Reception==
Although Wolf's works were widely praised in both Germanys in the 1970s and 1980s, they have sometimes been seen as controversial since [[German reunification]].<ref>Myra N. Love. Christa Wolf and the Conscience of History. Peter Lang, 1991. p. i.</ref><ref>Gail Finney. Christa Wolf. Twayne, 1999. p. 9</ref> [[William Dalrymple (historian)|William Dalrymple]] wrote that in East Germany "writers such as Christa Wolf became irrelevant overnight once the Berlin Wall was broached".<ref name="dalrymple20190824">{{Cite magazine |last=Dalrymple |first=William |author-link=William Dalrymple (historian) |title=Novel explosives of the Cold War |url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2019/08/novel-explosives-of-the-cold-war/ |magazine=The Spectator |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190826033137/https://www.spectator.co.uk/2019/08/novel-explosives-of-the-cold-war/ |archive-date=26 August 2019}} [https://outline.com/X9SnJv Alt URL]</ref> Upon publication of ''Was bleibt'', West German critics such as Frank Schirrmacher argued that Wolf failed to criticize the authoritarianism of the East German Communist regime, whilst others called her works "moralistic". Defenders have recognized Wolf's role in establishing a distinctly East German literary voice.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Impact of Two Reunification-Era Debates on the East German Sense of Identity|last=Augustine|first=Dolores L.|journal=German Studies Review|volume=27|issue=3|pages=569–571|year=2004|jstor=4140983|publisher=German Studies Association|doi=10.2307/4140983}}.</ref> [[Fausto Cercignani]]'s study of Wolf's earlier novels and essays on her later works have helped promote awareness of her narrative gifts, irrespective of her political and personal ups and downs. The emphasis placed by Cercignani on Christa Wolf's heroism has opened the way to subsequent studies in this direction.<ref>[[Fausto Cercignani]], ''Existenz und Heldentum bei Christa Wolf. "Der geteilte Himmel" und "Kassandra"'' (Existence and Heroism in Christa Wolf. "Divided Heaven" and "Cassandra"), Würzburg, Königshausen & Neumann, 1988. For subsequent essays see http://en.scientificcommons.org/fausto_cercignani.</ref>

Wolf received the [[Heinrich Mann Prize]] in 1963, the [[Georg Büchner Prize]] in 1980, and the [[Schiller Memorial Prize]] in 1983, the [[Geschwister-Scholl-Preis]] in 1987, as well as other national and international awards. After the German reunification, Wolf received further awards: in 1999 she was awarded the [[Elisabeth Langgässer]] Prize and the [[Nelly Sachs Prize|Nelly Sachs Literature Prize]]. Wolf became the first recipient of the [[Deutscher Bücherpreis]] (German Book Prize) in 2002 for her lifetime achievement. In 2010, Wolf was awarded the [[Großer Literaturpreis der Bayerischen Akademie der Schönen Künste]].
