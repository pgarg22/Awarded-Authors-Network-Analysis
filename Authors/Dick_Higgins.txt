==Life==
Dick Higgins was the son of Carter Chapin Higgins and Katherine Huntington Bigelow. He was born in [[Cambridge, England]] in 1938 into a rather rich family, due to his father owning Worcester Pressed Steel in Worcester, Massachusetts. He grew up with a brother and sister, Mark and Lisa. His younger brother [[Mark Huntington Higgins]] was murdered in the Congo in 1960. 

As a boy, Higgins grew up and was educated in private boarding schools around the New England area, including Worcester, Massachusetts, [[Putney, Vermont]], and [[Concord, New Hampshire]] When he got older, he spent a lot of time in school, he attended [[Yale]], [[Columbia University]] (1960), Manhattan School of Printing, and [[the New School]]. He trained under many influential artists of this time, such as [[John Cage]] and [[Henry Cowell]]. From Columbia he earned a bachelor's degree in English, and at the New School, he participated in John Cage’s monumental music composition course. 

In 1960, he wed [[Alison Knowles]], a fellow artist, and four years later, they had their daughters, [[Hannah Higgins]] and Jessica Higgins. They both grew up to continue the family Fluxus dynasty.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/2016/06/30/her-ordinary-materials-fluxus-artist-alison-knowles-on-her-carnegie-museum-show/|title=Her Ordinary Materials: Fluxus Artist Alison Knowles on Her Carnegie Museum Show|last=Greenberger|first=Alex|date=June 30, 2016|website=ARTnews|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-15|archive-date=2019-05-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190515005449/http://www.artnews.com/2016/06/30/her-ordinary-materials-fluxus-artist-alison-knowles-on-her-carnegie-museum-show/|url-status=live}}</ref> One daughter of Higgins and Knowles, Hannah Higgins, is the author of ''Fluxus Experience'',<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520228672/fluxus-experience|title=Fluxus Experience|language=en|access-date=2019-05-15|archive-date=2019-05-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190515010056/https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520228672/fluxus-experience|url-status=live}}</ref> an authoritative volume about the Fluxus movement.

==Career==
Higgins heard the [[John Cage]] ''Twenty-five-year Retrospective Concert'' in May 1958, and began studying with him that summer.<ref>Robinson, Julia and Xatrec, Christian, editors. [https://www.academia.edu/4061715/_Plus_or_Minus_1961_A_Chronology_1959-1963_ Plus or Minus 1961 – A Chronology 1959-1963] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412194003/https://www.academia.edu/4061715/_Plus_or_Minus_1961_A_Chronology_1959-1963_ |date=2019-04-12 }}. Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, Madrid.</ref> Higgins and Alison Knowles both took part in the [[Wiesbaden]], Germany ''Fluxus'' festival in 1962, that marked the founding of Fluxus activity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fluxus.lib.uiowa.edu/history.html|title=History {{!}} Fluxus Digital Collection|website=thestudio.uiowa.edu|access-date=2019-05-15|archive-date=2019-05-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190515010054/https://thestudio.uiowa.edu/fluxus/history|url-status=live}}</ref> He founded [[Something Else Press]] in 1963, which published many important texts including [[Gertrude Stein]], [[Bern Porter]], [[Marshall McLuhan]], Cage, [[Merce Cunningham]], Cage's teacher [[Henry Cowell]], as well as his contemporaries such as artists [[Allan Kaprow]], [[Al Hansen]], [[Claes Oldenburg]] and [[Ray Johnson]] as well as leading Fluxus members [[La Monte Young]], [[George Brecht]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[Daniel Spoerri]], [[Emmett Williams]], [[Eric Andersen (artist)|Eric Andersen]], [[Ken Friedman]], [[Ben Patterson]],and others. The Something Else Press series of "Great Bear Pamphlets," documented the earliest Fluxus performances.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0813533031 Mead Art Museum (Amherst College), ''Critical Mass: Happenings, Fluxus, Performance, Intermedia, and Rutgers University, 1958-1972''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210423080402/https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&tbm=bks&q=isbn:0813533031 |date=2021-04-23 }}, Rutgers University Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0813533031}}</ref>

He was an early and ardent proponent and user of computers as a tool for art making, dating back to the mid-1960s,<ref>Oxford Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art, p. 239</ref> when Alison Knowles and he created the first computer generated literary texts. His ''A Book About Love & War & Death'', a book-length [[aleatory]] poem published in 1972 included one of those. In his introduction, Higgins states, having finished the first three parts of the poem throwing dice, he wrote a [[FORTRAN IV]] program to produce part (or ''Canto'') four.<ref>Hannah B Higgins, ''The Computational Word Works of [[Eric Andersen (artist)|Eric Andersen]] and Dick Higgins'' in H. Higgins, & D. Kahn (Eds.), Mainframe experimentalism: Early digital computing in the experimental arts, pp.282-283</ref> Higgins also created ''metadrama'' poems that were ''minimal emotional statements or narratives''.<ref>Higgins, Dick ''Metadramas Maltus'' Barrytown, New York 1985.</ref> Between 1976 and 1994 he collaborated with the Italian writer and visual artist [[Luciano Caruso (poet)]] through email correspondence.<ref>{{cite archive |first=Dick|last= Higgins|item =Lettere di Dick Higgins a Luciano Caruso |item-url = |type =Letters |item-id =2|date =1976-1994|pages= 44|file =15 |box=23 |collection = Archivio Luciano Caruso |collection-url = http://archiviolucianocarus.wixsite.com/archivio-caruso-4 |repository = |institution = Archivio Luciano Caruso |location = Via de Ginori, 23 |oclc= |accession= 1976-1994|ref=}}</ref>

Higgins wrote and edited forty-seven books, including ''[[George Herbert]]'s Pattern Poems: In Their Tradition'' and ''On the Composition of Signs and Images'', his edition of a [[Giordano Bruno]] text, which he annotated. He saw Bruno's essay on the ''[[art of memory]]'' also as an early text on intermedia. ''A Dialectic of Centuries: Notes towards a Theory of the New Arts'' collected many of his essays and theoretical works in 1976. In 1972 Higgins founded Unpublished Editions (later renamed Printed Editions) to publish his short novel ''Amigo''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1136806199 Taylor and Francis, ''A Dictionary of the Avant-Gardes''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210423080403/https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&tbm=bks&q=isbn:1136806199 |date=2021-04-23 }}, Routledge, 2013, {{ISBN|1136806199}}</ref> In 2018, Siglio Press published a posthumous collection of Higgins's writings titled ''Fluxus, Intermedia and the Something Else Press.
