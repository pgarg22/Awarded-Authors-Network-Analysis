Eliot first attracted widespread attention for his poem "[[The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock]]" in 1915, which was received as a modernist masterpiece. It was followed by some of the best-known poems in the English language, including "[[The Waste Land]]" (1922), "[[The Hollow Men]]" (1925), "[[Ash Wednesday (poem)|Ash Wednesday]]" (1930), and ''[[Four Quartets]]'' (1943).<ref name=EB>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/184705/T-S-Eliot "Thomas Stearns Eliot"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.

==Life==
===Early life and education===
The [[Eliot family (America)|Eliots]] were a [[Boston Brahmin]] family, with roots in England and [[New England]]. Eliot's paternal grandfather, [[William Greenleaf Eliot]], had moved to [[St. Louis]], Missouri,<ref name=EB/><ref>Bush, Ronald, ''T. S. Eliot: The Modernist in History'' (New York, 1991), p. 72.</ref> to establish a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] Christian church there. His father, [[Henry Ware Eliot]] (1843–1919), was a successful businessman, president and treasurer of the Hydraulic-Press Brick Company in St Louis. His mother, [[Charlotte Champe Stearns]] (1843–1929), who wrote poetry, was a [[social worker]], which was a new profession in the U.S. in the early 20th century. Eliot was the last of six surviving children. Known to family and friends as Tom, he was the namesake of his maternal grandfather, Thomas Stearns.

Eliot's childhood infatuation with literature can be ascribed to several factors. First, he had to overcome physical limitations as a child. Struggling from a congenital double [[inguinal hernia]], he could not participate in many physical activities and thus was prevented from socialising with his peers. As he was often isolated, his love for literature developed. Once he learned to read, the young boy immediately became obsessed with books, favouring tales of savage life, the Wild West, or [[Mark Twain]]'s thrill-seeking [[Tom Sawyer]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Worthen|first=John|title=T.S. Eliot: A Short Biography|year=2009|publisher=Haus Publishing|location=London|page=9}}</ref> In his memoir of Eliot, his friend Robert Sencourt comments that the young Eliot "would often curl up in the window-seat behind an enormous book, setting the drug of dreams against the pain of living."<ref>{{cite book|last=Sencourt|first=Robert|title=T.S. Eliot, A Memoir|year=1971|publisher=Garnstone Limited|location=London|page=18}}</ref> Secondly, Eliot credited his hometown with fuelling his literary vision: "It is self-evident that St. Louis affected me more deeply than any other environment has ever done. I feel that there is something in having passed one's childhood beside the [[Mississippi River|big river]], which is incommunicable to those people who have not. I consider myself fortunate to have been born here, rather than in Boston, or New York, or London."<ref>Letter to Marquis Childs quoted in ''St. Louis Post Dispatch'' (15 October 1930) and in the address "American Literature and the American Language" delivered at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] (9 June 1953), published in Washington University Studies, ''New Series: Literature and Language'', no. 23 (St. Louis: Washington University Press, 1953), p. 6.</ref>

From 1898 to 1905, Eliot attended [[Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School|Smith Academy]], the boys college preparatory division of [[Washington University in St. Louis|Washington University]], where his studies included Latin, Ancient Greek, French, and German. He began to write poetry when he was 14 under the influence of [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward Fitzgerald]]'s translation of the ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]].'' He said the results were gloomy and despairing and he destroyed them.<ref name=Hall>{{cite journal|first=Donald|last=Hall|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/4738/the-art-of-poetry-no-1-t-s-eliot|title=The Art of Poetry No. 1|journal=[[The Paris Review]]|issue=21|date=Spring–Summer 1959|access-date=29 November 2011}}</ref> His first published poem, "A Fable For Feasters", was written as a school exercise and was published in the ''Smith Academy Record'' in February 1905.<ref name=Gallup>{{cite book|first=Donald|last=Gallup|title=T.

Eliot lived in St. Louis, Missouri for the first 16 years of his life at the house on Locust Street where he was born. After going away to school in 1905, he only returned to St. Louis for vacations and visits. Despite moving away from the city, Eliot wrote to a friend that the "Missouri and the Mississippi have made a deeper impression on me than any other part of the world."<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/LiterarySt.Louis|title=Literary St. Louis|publisher=Associates of St. Louis University Libraries, Inc. and Landmarks Association of St. Louis, Inc.|year=1969}}</ref>

Following graduation, Eliot attended [[Milton Academy]] in [[Massachusetts]] for a preparatory year, where he met [[Scofield Thayer]] who later published ''[[The Waste Land]]''. He studied at [[Harvard College]] from 1906 to 1909, earning a Bachelor of Arts in an elective program similar to comparative literature in 1909 and a Master of Arts in English literature the following year.<ref name="english.illinois.edu" /><ref name=EB/> Because of his year at Milton Academy, Eliot was allowed to earn his Bachelor of Arts after three years instead of the usual four.<ref>{{Cite book|title=T. S.

This introduced him to [[Jules Laforgue]], [[Arthur Rimbaud]], and [[Paul Verlaine]]. Without Verlaine, Eliot wrote, he might never have heard of [[Tristan Corbière]] and his book ''Les amours jaunes'', a work that affected the course of Eliot's life.<ref name=Kermode/> The ''Harvard Advocate'' published some of his poems and he became lifelong friends with [[Conrad Aiken]], the American writer and critic.

After working as a philosophy assistant at Harvard from 1909 to 1910, Eliot moved to Paris where, from 1910 to 1911, he studied philosophy at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. He attended lectures by [[Henri Bergson]] and read poetry with [[Alain-Fournier|Henri Alban-Fournier]].<ref name=EB/><ref name=Kermode>Kermode, Frank.

Eliot|language=en-US|access-date=6 January 2020}}</ref>   Eliot was awarded a scholarship to [[Merton College, Oxford]], in 1914. He first visited [[Marburg]], Germany, where he planned to take a summer programme, but when the [[First World War]] broke out he went to Oxford instead. At the time so many American students attended Merton that the [[Junior Common Room]] proposed a motion "that this society abhors the [[Americanization]] of Oxford". It was defeated by two votes after Eliot reminded the students how much they owed American culture.<ref name=SeymourJones1>Seymour-Jones, Carole. [http://www.ebooks.com/ebooks/book_display.asp?IID=193222 ''Painted Shadow: The Life of Vivienne Eliot, First Wife of T. S. Eliot'', Knopf Publishing Group, p. 1.]</ref>

Eliot wrote to Conrad Aiken on New Year's Eve 1914: "I hate university towns and university people, who are the same everywhere, with pregnant wives, sprawling children, many books and hideous pictures on the walls [...] Oxford is very pretty, but I don't like to be dead."<ref name=SeymourJones1/> Escaping Oxford, Eliot spent much of his time in London. This city had a monumental and life-altering effect on Eliot for several reasons, the most significant of which was his introduction to the influential American literary figure [[Ezra Pound]]. A connection through Aiken resulted in an arranged meeting and on 22 September 1914, Eliot paid a visit to Pound's flat. Pound instantly deemed Eliot "worth watching" and was crucial to Eliot's fledgling career as a poet, as he is credited with promoting Eliot through social events and literary gatherings. Thus, according to biographer John Worthen, during his time in England Eliot "was seeing as little of Oxford as possible". He was instead spending long periods of time in London, in the company of Ezra Pound and "some of the modern artists whom the war has so far spared [...] It was Pound who helped most, introducing him everywhere."<ref>{{cite book|last=Worthen|first=John|title=T.S. Eliot: A Short Biography|year=2009|publisher=Haus Publishing|location=London|pages=34–36}}</ref> In the end, Eliot did not settle at Merton and left after a year. In 1915 he taught English at [[Birkbeck, University of London]].

In 1916, he completed a doctoral dissertation for Harvard on "Knowledge and Experience in the Philosophy of [[F. H. Bradley]]", but he failed to return for the ''[[Oral exam|viva voce]]'' exam.<ref name=EB/><ref>For a reading of the dissertation, see {{Cite journal  | last = Brazeal  | first = Gregory  | title = The Alleged Pragmatism of T.S.

===Marriage===
[[File:Vivienne Haigh-Wood Eliot 1920.jpg|thumb|[[Vivienne Haigh-Wood Eliot]], passport photograph from 1920. ]]
Before leaving the US, Eliot had told Emily Hale that he was in love with her. He exchanged letters with her from Oxford during 1914 and 1915, but they did not meet again until 1927.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.princeton.edu/manuscripts/2017/05/16/sealed-treasure-t-s-eliot-letters-to-emily-hale/|title=Sealed Treasure: T. S. Eliot Letters to Emily Hale|last=Skemer|first=Don|date=16 May 2017|website=PUL Manuscripts News|language=en-US|access-date=6 January 2020}}</ref> In a letter to Aiken late in December 1914, Eliot, aged 26, wrote: "I am very dependent upon women (I mean female society)."<ref>Eliot, T. S. ''The Letters of T. S. Eliot, Volume 1, 1898–1922''. p. 75.</ref> Less than four months later, Thayer introduced Eliot to [[Vivienne Haigh-Wood]], a Cambridge [[governess]]. They were married at Hampstead Register Office on 26 June 1915.<ref>[[John Richardson (art historian)|Richardson, John]], ''Sacred Monsters, Sacred Masters''. Random House, 2001, p. 20.</ref>

After a short visit, alone, to his family in the United States, Eliot returned to London and took several teaching jobs, such as lecturing at [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]], [[University of London]]. The philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] took an interest in Vivienne while the newlyweds stayed in his flat. Some scholars have suggested that she and Russell had an affair, but the allegations were never confirmed.<ref>Seymour-Jones, Carole. ''Painted Shadow: A Life of Vivienne Eliot''. Knopf Publishing Group, 2001, p. 17.</ref>

The marriage was markedly unhappy, in part because of Vivienne's health problems. In a letter addressed to Ezra Pound, she covers an extensive list of her symptoms, which included a habitually high temperature, [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[insomnia]], [[migraine]]s, and [[colitis]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Letters of T.S. Eliot: Volume 1, 1898–1922|year=1988|publisher=Faber and Faber|location=London|page=533}}</ref> This, coupled with apparent mental instability, meant that she was often sent away by Eliot and her doctors for extended periods of time in the hope of improving her health. And as time went on, he became increasingly detached from her. The couple formally separated in 1933 and in 1938 Vivienne's brother, Maurice, had her committed to a mental hospital, against her will, where she remained until her death of heart disease in 1947.

Their relationship became the subject of a 1984 play ''[[Tom & Viv (play)|Tom & Viv]]'', which in 1994 was adapted as a film of [[Tom & Viv|the same name]].

In a private paper written in his sixties, Eliot confessed: "I came to persuade myself that I was in love with Vivienne simply because I wanted to burn my boats and commit myself to staying in England. And she persuaded herself (also under the influence of [Ezra] Pound) that she would save the poet by keeping him in England. To her, the marriage brought no happiness. To me, it brought the state of mind out of which came ''The Waste Land''."<ref>Eliot, T. S. ''The Letters of T. S. Eliot, Volume 1, 1898–1922.'' London: Faber and Faber. 1988. p. xvii.</ref>

===Teaching, banking, and publishing===
[[File:TSEliotFaberHouse (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|A plaque at [[School of Oriental and African Studies|SOAS]]'s Faber Building, 24 [[Russell Square]], London]]
After leaving Merton, Eliot worked as a schoolteacher, most notably at [[Highgate School]] in London, where he taught French and Latin: his students included [[John Betjeman]].<ref name=EB/> He subsequently taught at the [[Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe]] in [[Buckinghamshire]]. To earn extra money, he wrote book reviews and lectured at evening extension courses at University College London and Oxford. In 1917, he took a position at [[Lloyds Bank]] in London, working on foreign accounts. On a trip to Paris in August 1920 with the artist [[Wyndham Lewis]], he met the writer [[James Joyce]]. Eliot said he found Joyce arrogant, and Joyce doubted Eliot's ability as a poet at the time, but the two writers soon became friends, with Eliot visiting Joyce whenever he was in Paris.<ref>[[Richard Ellmann|Ellmann, Richard]]. ''James Joyce''. pp. 492–495.</ref> Eliot and Wyndham Lewis also maintained a close friendship, leading to Lewis's later making his well-known portrait painting of Eliot in 1938.

===Conversion to Anglicanism and British citizenship===
[[File:T.S. Eliot house.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Faber and Faber]] building where Eliot worked from 1925 to 1965; the commemorative plaque is under the right-hand arch.]]
On 29 June 1927, Eliot converted from [[Unitarianism]] to [[Anglicanism]], and in November that year he took [[British nationality law|British citizenship]]. He became a [[churchwarden]] of his parish church, [[St Stephen's, Gloucester Road]], London, and a life member of the [[Society of King Charles the Martyr]].<ref>Plaque on interior wall of Saint Stephen's</ref><ref>Obituary notice in ''Church and King'', Vol. XVII, No. 4, 28 February 1965,−− p. 3.</ref> He specifically identified as [[Anglo-Catholic]], proclaiming himself "classicist in literature, royalist in politics, and anglo-catholic {{sic}} in religion".<ref>Specific quote is "The general point of view [of the essays] may be described as classicist in literature, royalist in politics, and anglo-catholic {{sic}} in religion", in preface by T.

One of Eliot's biographers, [[Peter Ackroyd]], commented that "the purposes of [Eliot's conversion] were two-fold. One: the Church of England offered Eliot some hope for himself, and I think Eliot needed some resting place. But secondly, it attached Eliot to the English community and English culture."<ref name="learner.org"/>

===Separation and remarriage===
By 1932, Eliot had been contemplating a separation from his wife for some time. When Harvard offered him the [[Charles Eliot Norton professorship]] for the 1932–1933 academic year, he accepted and left Vivienne in England. Upon his return, he arranged for a formal separation from her, avoiding all but one meeting with her between his leaving for America in 1932 and her death in 1947. Vivienne was committed to the Northumberland House mental hospital in Woodberry Down, [[Manor House, London#Early development|Manor House, London]], in 1938, and remained there until she died. Although Eliot was still legally her husband, he never visited her.<ref>Seymour-Jones, Carole. ''Painted Shadow: A Life of Vivienne Eliot''. Constable 2001, p. 561.</ref> From 1933 to 1946 Eliot had a close emotional relationship with Emily Hale. Eliot later destroyed Hale's letters to him, but Hale donated Eliot's to Princeton University Library where they were [[List of sealed archives|sealed]] until 2020.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/02/ts-eliot-hidden-love-letters-reveal-intense-heartbreaking-affair-emily-hale|title=TS Eliot's hidden love letters reveal intense, heartbreaking affair|last=Helmore|first=Edward|date=2 January 2020|work=The Guardian|access-date=6 January 2020|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> When Eliot heard of the donation he deposited his own account of their relationship with Harvard University to be opened whenever the Princeton letters were.<ref name=":1" />

Eliot: The Modernist in History'' 1991, p. 11: "Mary Trevelyan, then aged forty, was less important for Eliot's writing. Where Emily Hale and Vivienne were part of Eliot's private phantasmagoria, Mary Trevelyan played her part in what was essentially a public friendship.

From 1946 to 1957, Eliot shared a flat at 19 [[Carlyle Mansions]], Chelsea, with his friend [[John Davy Hayward]], who collected and managed Eliot's papers, styling himself "Keeper of the Eliot Archive".<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/books-obituaries/9670663/Valerie-Eliot.html "Valerie Eliot"], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 11 November 2012.

When Eliot and Hayward separated their household in 1957, Hayward retained his collection of Eliot's papers, which he bequeathed to [[King's College, Cambridge]], in 1965.

On 10 January 1957, at the age of 68, Eliot married [[Esmé Valerie Fletcher]], who was 30. In contrast to his first marriage, Eliot knew Fletcher well, as she had been his secretary at Faber and Faber since August 1949. They kept their wedding secret; the ceremony was held in St. Barnabas' Church, [[Kensington]], London,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/archive/frame/article/1957-01-11/10/3.html|title=Marriage.

Eliot had no children with either of his wives. In the early 1960s, by then in failing health, Eliot worked as an editor for the [[Wesleyan University Press]], seeking new poets in Europe for publication. After Eliot's death, Valerie dedicated her time to preserving his legacy, by editing and annotating ''The Letters of T. S.

In 1967, on the second anniversary of his death, Eliot was commemorated by the placement of a large stone in the floor of [[Poets' Corner]] in London's [[Westminster Abbey]].

==Poetry==
For a poet of his stature, Eliot produced a relatively small number of poems. He was aware of this even early in his career. He wrote to J.H. Woods, one of his former Harvard professors, "My reputation in London is built upon one small volume of verse, and is kept up by printing two or three more poems in a year. The only thing that matters is that these should be perfect in their kind, so that each should be an event."<ref>Eliot, T. S. "Letter to J. H. Woods, April 21, 1919." ''The Letters of T. S. Eliot'', vol. I. Valerie Eliot (ed.), New York: Harcourt Brace, 1988, p. 285.</ref>

Typically, Eliot first published his poems individually in periodicals or in small books or pamphlets and then collected them in books. His first collection was ''Prufrock and Other Observations'' (1917). In 1920, he published more poems in ''Ara Vos Prec'' (London) and ''Poems: 1920'' (New York). These had the same poems (in a different order) except that "Ode" in the British edition was replaced with "Hysteria" in the American edition. In 1925, he collected ''The Waste Land'' and the poems in ''Prufrock'' and ''Poems'' into one volume and added ''The Hollow Men'' to form ''Poems: 1909–1925''. From then on, he updated this work as ''Collected Poems''. Exceptions are ''Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats'' (1939), a collection of light verse; ''Poems Written in Early Youth'', posthumously published in 1967 and consisting mainly of poems published between 1907 and 1910 in ''[[The Harvard Advocate]]'', and ''Inventions of the March Hare: Poems 1909–1917'', material Eliot never intended to have published, which appeared posthumously in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theworld.com/~raparker/exploring/tseliot/works/poems/eliot-harvard-poems.html |title=T. S. Eliot: ''The Harvard Advocate Poems'' |publisher=Theworld.com |access-date=3 August 2009}}</ref>

During an interview in 1959, Eliot said of his nationality and its role in his work: "I'd say that my poetry has obviously more in common with my distinguished contemporaries in America than with anything written in my generation in England. That I'm sure of. ... It wouldn't be what it is, and I imagine it wouldn't be so good; putting it as modestly as I can, it wouldn't be what it is if I'd been born in England, and it wouldn't be what it is if I'd stayed in America. It's a combination of things. But in its sources, in its emotional springs, it comes from America."<ref name=Hall25>{{cite journal

Cleo McNelly Kearns notes in her biography that Eliot was deeply influenced by Indic traditions, notably the [[Upanishads]]. From the Sanskrit ending of ''The Waste Land'' to the "What Krishna meant" section of ''Four Quartets'' shows how much Indic religions and more specifically Hinduism made up his philosophical basic for his thought process.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/5912809|title=T. S. Eliot and Indic Traditions: A Study in Poetry and Belief|website=academia.edu|access-date=8 March 2016}}</ref> It must also be acknowledged, as [[Chinmoy Guha]] showed in his book ''Where the Dreams Cross: T S Eliot and French Poetry'' (Macmillan, 2011) that he was deeply influenced by French poets from Baudelaire to Paul Valéry. He himself wrote in his 1940 essay on W.B. Yeats: "The kind of poetry that I needed to teach me the use of my own voice did not exist in English at all; it was only to be found in French." ("Yeats", ''On Poetry and Poets'', 1948).

==="The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock"===
{{Main|The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock}}

In 1915, [[Ezra Pound]], overseas editor of ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'' magazine, recommended to [[Harriet Monroe]], the magazine's founder, that she should publish "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock".<ref>Mertens, Richard. [http://magazine.uchicago.edu/0108/features/letter.html "Letter By Letter"] in The University of Chicago Magazine (August 2001). Retrieved 23 April 2007.</ref> Although the character Prufrock seems to be middle-aged, Eliot wrote most of the poem when he was only twenty-two. Its now-famous opening lines, comparing the evening sky to "a patient etherised upon a table", were considered shocking and offensive, especially at a time when [[Georgian Poetry]] was hailed for its derivations of the nineteenth century [[romanticism|Romantic Poets]].<ref>See, for example, Eliot, T. S. (21 December 2010). ''The Waste Land and Other Poems''. Broadview Press. p. 133. {{ISBN|978-1-77048-267-8}}. Retrieved 27 February 2019. (citing an unsigned review in ''Literary World''. 5 July 1917, vol. lxxxiii, 107.)</ref>

The poem's structure was heavily influenced by Eliot's extensive reading of [[Dante]] and refers to a number of literary works, including ''[[Hamlet]]'' and those of the French Symbolists. Its reception in London can be gauged from an unsigned review in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' on 21 June 1917. "The fact that these things occurred to the mind of Mr. Eliot is surely of the very smallest importance to anyone, even to himself. They certainly have no relation to ''poetry''."<ref>Waugh, Arthur. [https://www.usask.ca/english/prufrock/recept1.htm "The New Poetry"], ''Quarterly Review'', October 1916, p. 226, citing the ''Times Literary Supplement'' 21 June 1917, no. 805, 299; Wagner, Erica (2001), [https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4250053,00.html "An eruption of fury"], ''The Guardian'', letters to the editor, 4 September 2001.

==="The Waste Land"===
[[File:T.S. Eliot, 1923.JPG|thumb|right|Eliot in 1923 by [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]]]]
{{Main|The Waste Land}}
In October 1922, Eliot published "The Waste Land" in ''[[The Criterion]]''. Eliot's dedication to ''il miglior fabbro'' ('the better craftsman') refers to Ezra Pound's significant hand in editing and reshaping the poem from a longer Eliot manuscript, to the shortened version that appears in publication.<ref name="MillerJames E. Hughes Jr2005">{{cite book|last=Miller|first=James H., Jr.|title=T. S.

It was composed during a period of personal difficulty for Eliot—his marriage was failing, and both he and Vivienne were suffering from nervous disorders. Before the poem's publication as a book in December 1922, Eliot distanced himself from its vision of despair. On 15 November 1922, he wrote to [[Richard Aldington]], saying, "As for ''The Waste Land'', that is a thing of the past so far as I am concerned and I am now feeling toward a new form and style."<ref>''The Letters of T. S. Eliot'', Vol.&nbsp;1, p.&nbsp;596.</ref> The poem is often read as a representation of the disillusionment of the post-war generation. Dismissing this view, Eliot commented in 1931, "When I wrote a poem called ''The Waste Land'', some of the more approving critics said that I had expressed ‘the disillusion of a generation’, which is nonsense. I may have expressed for them their own illusion of being disillusioned, but that did not form part of my intention"<ref>''The Poems of T.S. Eliot, Volume 1: Collected & Uncollected Poems''. Edited by Christopher Ricks and Jim McCue, Faber & Faber, 2015, p. 576</ref>

The poem is known for its obscure nature—its slippage between satire and prophecy; its abrupt changes of speaker, location, and time. This structural complexity is one of the reasons why the poem has become a touchstone of [[Modernist poetry in English|modern literature]], a poetic counterpart to a novel published in the same year, [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.<ref>MacCabe, Colin. ''T. S. Eliot''. Tavistock: Northcote House, 2006.</ref>

Among its best-known phrases are "April is the cruellest month", "I will show you fear in a handful of dust" and ''"[[Shanti Mantra|Shantih shantih shantih]]"''. The Sanskrit ''[[mantra]]'' ends the poem.

==="The Hollow Men"===
{{Main|The Hollow Men|The Hollow Men in popular culture}}
"The Hollow Men" appeared in 1925. For the critic [[Edmund Wilson]], it marked "The nadir of the phase of despair and desolation given such effective expression in 'The Waste Land'."<ref>[[Edmund Wilson|Wilson, Edmund]]. "Review of Ash Wednesday", ''New Republic'', 20 August 1930.</ref> It is Eliot's major poem of the late 1920s. Similar to Eliot's other works, its themes are overlapping and fragmentary. Post-war Europe under the [[Treaty of Versailles]] (which Eliot despised), the difficulty of hope and religious conversion, Eliot's failed marriage.<ref>See, for instance, the biographically oriented work of one of Eliot's editors and major critics, Ronald Schuchard.</ref>

[[Allen Tate]] perceived a shift in Eliot's method, writing, "The mythologies disappear altogether in 'The Hollow Men'." This is a striking claim for a poem as indebted to [[Dante]] as anything else in Eliot's early work, to say little of the modern English mythology—the "Old [[Guy Fawkes]]" of the [[Gunpowder Plot]]—or the colonial and [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] mythos of [[Joseph Conrad]] and [[James George Frazer]], which, at least for reasons of textual history, echo in ''The Waste Land''.<ref>Grant, Michael (ed.). ''T. S. Eliot: the Critical Heritage''. Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1982.</ref> The "continuous parallel between contemporaneity and antiquity" that is so characteristic of his mythical method remained in fine form.<ref>" 'Ulysses', Order, and Myth", ''Selected Essays'' T. S. Eliot (orig 1923).</ref> "The Hollow Men" contains some of Eliot's most famous lines, notably its conclusion: <blockquote>''This is the way the world ends''<br />''Not with a bang but a whimper.''</blockquote>

==="Ash-Wednesday"===
{{Main|Ash Wednesday (poem)}}
"Ash-Wednesday" is the first long poem written by Eliot, after his 1927 conversion to [[Church of England|Anglicanism]]. Published in 1930, it deals with the struggle that ensues when a person who has lacked faith acquires it. Sometimes referred to as Eliot's "conversion poem", it is richly but ambiguously allusive, and deals with the aspiration to move from spiritual barrenness to hope for human [[salvation]]. Eliot's style of writing in "Ash-Wednesday" showed a marked shift from the poetry he had written prior to his 1927 conversion, and his post-conversion style continued in a similar vein. His style became less ironic, and the poems were no longer populated by multiple characters in dialogue. Eliot's subject matter also became more focused on his spiritual concerns and his Christian faith.<ref>Raine, Craig. ''T. S. Eliot'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006)</ref>

Many critics were particularly enthusiastic about "Ash-Wednesday". [[Edwin Muir]] maintained that it is one of the most moving poems Eliot wrote, and perhaps the "most perfect", though it was not well received by everyone. The poem's groundwork of orthodox Christianity discomfited many of the more secular ''[[Intellectual|literati]]''.<ref name=EB/><ref name=Untermeyer>[[Louis Untermeyer|Untermeyer, Louis]].

===''Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats''===
{{Main|Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats}}
In 1939, Eliot published a book of [[light verse]], ''Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats''. ("Old Possum" was [[Ezra Pound]]'s friendly nickname for T. S. Eliot.) This first edition had an illustration of the author on the cover. In 1954, the composer [[Alan Rawsthorne]] set six of the poems for speaker and orchestra in a work titled ''Practical Cats''. After Eliot's death, the book was the basis of the musical ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], first produced in London's West End in 1981 and opening on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] the following year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/20th-century-literature/articles/an-introduction-to-old-possums-book-of-practical-cats|title=An introduction to Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats|website=The British Library|access-date=27 February 2018}}</ref>

===''Four Quartets''===
{{Main|Four Quartets}}
Eliot regarded ''Four Quartets'' as his masterpiece, and it is the work that most of all led him to being awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].<ref name=EB/> It consists of four long poems, each first published separately: "[[Burnt Norton]]" (1936), "[[East Coker (poem)|East Coker]]" (1940), "[[The Dry Salvages]]" (1941) and "[[Little Gidding (poem)|Little Gidding]]" (1942). Each has five sections. Although they resist easy characterisation, each poem includes meditations on the nature of time in some important respect—[[theological]], historical, physical—and its relation to the human condition. Each poem is associated with one of the four [[classical elements]], respectively: air, earth, water, and fire.

"Burnt Norton" is a meditative poem that begins with the narrator trying to focus on the present moment while walking through a garden, focusing on images and sounds such as the bird, the roses, clouds and an empty pool. The meditation leads the narrator to reach "the still point" in which there is no attempt to get anywhere or to experience place and/or time, instead experiencing "a grace of sense". In the final section, the narrator contemplates the arts ("words" and "music") as they relate to time. The narrator focuses particularly on the poet's art of manipulating "Words [which] strain, / Crack and sometimes break, under the burden [of time], under the tension, slip, slide, perish, decay with imprecision, [and] will not stay in place, / Will not stay still." By comparison, the narrator concludes that "Love is itself unmoving, / Only the cause and end of movement, / Timeless, and undesiring."

"East Coker" continues the examination of time and meaning, focusing in a famous passage on the nature of language and poetry. Out of darkness, Eliot offers a solution: "I said to my soul, be still, and wait without hope."

"The Dry Salvages" treats the element of water, via images of river and sea. It strives to contain opposites: "The past and future / Are conquered, and reconciled."

"Little Gidding" (the element of fire) is the most anthologised of the ''Quartets''.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2013-12-22|title=The complete simplicity of T. S. Eliot|url=https://joshuaspodek.com/complete-simplicity-t-s-eliot|access-date=2020-11-07|website=Joshua Spodek|language=en|quote=Little Gidding (the element of fire) is the most anthologized of the Quartets.}}</ref> Eliot's experiences as an air raid warden in [[the Blitz]] power the poem, and he imagines meeting [[Dante]] during the German bombing. The beginning of the ''Quartets'' ("Houses / Are removed, destroyed") had become a violent everyday experience; this creates an animation, where for the first time he talks of love as the driving force behind all experience. From this background, the ''Quartets'' end with an affirmation of [[Julian of Norwich]]: "All shall be well and / All manner of thing shall be well."<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Newman|first=Barbara|date=2011|title=Eliot's Affirmative Way: Julian of Norwich, Charles Williams, and Little Gidding|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/658355|journal=Modern Philology|volume=108|issue=3|pages=427–461|doi=10.1086/658355|jstor=10.1086/658355|s2cid=162999145|issn=0026-8232}}</ref>

The ''Four Quartets'' draws upon Christian theology, art, symbolism and language of such figures as Dante, and mystics [[St. John of the Cross]] and [[Julian of Norwich]].<ref name=":2" />

==Plays==
{{Main|Sweeney Agonistes|Murder in the Cathedral|The Rock (play)|The Family Reunion|The Cocktail Party|The Confidential Clerk|The Elder Statesman}}
With the important exception of ''Four Quartets'', Eliot directed much of his creative energies after ''Ash Wednesday'' to writing plays in verse, mostly comedies or plays with redemptive endings. He was long a critic and admirer of [[Elizabethan]] and [[Literature in English#Jacobean literature|Jacobean]] verse drama; witness his allusions to [[John Webster|Webster]], [[Thomas Middleton]], [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Thomas Kyd]] in ''The Waste Land''. In a 1933 lecture he said "Every poet would like, I fancy, to be able to think that he had some direct social utility . . . . He would like to be something of a popular entertainer and be able to think his own thoughts behind a tragic or a comic mask. He would like to convey the pleasures of poetry, not only to a larger audience but to larger groups of people collectively; and the theatre is the best place in which to do it."<ref name="upuc">Eliot, T. S. ''The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism'', Harvard University Press, 1933 (penultimate paragraph).</ref>

After ''The Waste Land'' (1922), he wrote that he was "now feeling toward a new form and style". One project he had in mind was writing a play in verse, using some of the rhythms of early [[jazz]]. The play featured "Sweeney", a character who had appeared in a number of his poems. Although Eliot did not finish the play, he did publish two scenes from the piece. These scenes, titled ''Fragment of a Prologue'' (1926) and ''Fragment of an Agon'' (1927), were published together in 1932 as ''[[Sweeney Agonistes]]''. Although Eliot noted that this was not intended to be a one-act play, it is sometimes performed as one.<ref name=Gallup/>

A pageant play by Eliot called ''The Rock'' was performed in 1934 for the benefit of churches in the [[Diocese of London]]. Much of it was a collaborative effort; Eliot accepted credit only for the authorship of one scene and the choruses.<ref name=Gallup/> [[George Bell (bishop)|George Bell]], the [[Bishop of Chichester]], had been instrumental in connecting Eliot with producer [[E. Martin Browne]] for the production of ''The Rock'', and later commissioned Eliot to write another play for the [[Canterbury Festival]] in 1935. 
This one, ''Murder in the Cathedral'', concerning the death of the martyr, [[Thomas Becket]], was more under Eliot's control. Eliot biographer [[Peter Ackroyd]] comments that "for [Eliot], ''Murder in the Cathedral'' and succeeding verse plays offered a double advantage; it allowed him to practice poetry but it also offered a convenient home for his religious sensibility."<ref name="learner.org"/> After this, he worked on more "commercial" plays for more general audiences: ''The Family Reunion'' (1939), ''The Cocktail Party'' (1949), ''The Confidential Clerk'', (1953) and ''The Elder Statesman'' (1958) (the latter three were produced by [[Henry Sherek]] and directed by [[E. Martin Browne]]<ref name="Darlington">{{cite ODNB|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36063|title=Henry Sherek|last=Darlington|first=W. A.|year=2004|access-date=27 July 2014|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/36063}}</ref>). The Broadway production in New York of ''The Cocktail Party'' received the 1950 [[Tony Award]] for Best Play. Eliot wrote ''The Cocktail Party'' while he was a visiting scholar at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]].<ref>[https://www.ias.edu/files/pdfs/publications/letter-2007-spring.pdf T. S. Eliot at the Institute for Advanced Study], ''The Institute Letter'', Spring 2007, p. 6.</ref><ref>[http://www.ias.edu/people/cos/users/teliot01 Eliot, Thomas Stearns] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119203650/https://www.ias.edu/people/cos/users/teliot01 |date=19 January 2015 }} IAS profile.</ref>

Regarding his method of playwriting, Eliot explained, "If I set out to write a play, I start by an act of choice. I settle upon a particular emotional situation, out of which characters and a plot will emerge. And then lines of poetry may come into being: not from the original impulse but from a secondary stimulation of the unconscious mind."<ref name="learner.org"/>

==Literary criticism==
Eliot also made significant contributions to the field of [[literary criticism]], and strongly influenced the school of ''[[New Criticism]]''. He was somewhat self-deprecating and minimising of his work and once said his criticism was merely a "by-product" of his "private poetry-workshop". But the critic [[William Empson]] once said, "I do not know for certain how much of my own mind [Eliot] invented, let alone how much of it is a reaction against him or indeed a consequence of misreading him. He is a very penetrating influence, perhaps not unlike the east wind."<ref>quoted in Roger Kimball, "A Craving for Reality", ''The New Criterion'' Vol. 18, 1999.</ref>

In his critical essay "[[Tradition and the Individual Talent]]", Eliot argues that art must be understood not in a vacuum, but in the context of previous pieces of art. "In a peculiar sense [an artist or poet] ... must inevitably be judged by the standards of the past."<ref name=bartleby1>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/200/sw4.html |title=Tradition and the Individual Talent|author= Eliot, T. S. |work=The Sacred Wood |publisher=Bartleby.com |year=1930 |access-date=3 August 2009}}</ref> This essay was an important influence over the New Criticism by introducing the idea that the value of a work of art must be viewed in the context of the artist's previous works, a "simultaneous order" of works (i.e., "tradition"). Eliot himself employed this concept on many of his works, especially on his long-poem ''The Waste Land''.<ref>[http://www.leidykla.vu.lt/fileadmin/Literatura/51_3/98-108.pdf Dirk Weidmann: ''And I Tiresias have foresuffered all...''].

Also important to New Criticism was the idea—as articulated in Eliot's essay "[[Hamlet and His Problems]]"—of an "[[objective correlative]]", which posits a connection among the words of the text and events, states of mind, and experiences.<ref name=Hamlet>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/200/sw9.html |title=Hamlet and His Problems|author= Eliot, T. S. |work= The Sacred Wood |publisher=Bartleby.com |year=1921 |access-date=3 August 2009}}</ref> This notion concedes that a poem means what it says, but suggests that there can be a non-subjective judgment based on different readers' different—but perhaps corollary—interpretations of a work.

More generally, New Critics took a cue from Eliot in regard to his "'classical' ideals and his religious thought; his attention to the poetry and drama of the early seventeenth century; his deprecation of the Romantics, especially [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]]; his proposition that good poems constitute 'not a turning loose of emotion but an escape from emotion'; and his insistence that 'poets... at present must be difficult'."<ref>Burt, Steven and Lewin, Jennifer. "Poetry and the New Criticism". ''A Companion to Twentieth-Century Poetry'', Neil Roberts, ed. Malden, Massachusetts: Blackwell Publishers, 2001. p. 154</ref>

Eliot's essays were a major factor in the revival of interest in the [[metaphysical poets]]. Eliot particularly praised the metaphysical poets' ability to show experience as both psychological and sensual, while at the same time infusing this portrayal with—in Eliot's view—wit and uniqueness. Eliot's essay "The Metaphysical Poets", along with giving new significance and attention to metaphysical poetry, introduced his now well-known definition of "unified sensibility", which is considered by some to mean the same thing as the term "metaphysical".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Baker |first1=Christopher Paul |title=Porphyro's Rose: Keats and T.S. Eliot's "The Metaphysical Poets" |journal=Journal of Modern Literature |date=2003 |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=57–62 |doi=10.1353/jml.2004.0051 |id={{Project MUSE|171830}} |s2cid=162044168 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Malloch |first1=A.

His 1922 poem ''The Waste Land''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/201/1.html |author=Eliot, T. S. |title=The Waste Land|publisher=Bartleby.com |year= 1922|access-date=3 August 2009}}</ref> also can be better understood in light of his work as a critic. He had argued that a poet must write "programmatic criticism", that is, a poet should write to advance his own interests rather than to advance "historical scholarship". Viewed from Eliot's critical lens, ''The Waste Land'' likely shows his personal despair about [[World War I]] rather than an objective historical understanding of it.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-2088/TS-Eliot |title=T. S. Eliot :: The Waste Land And Criticism |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |date=4 January 1965 |access-date=3 August 2009}}</ref>

Late in his career, Eliot focused much of his creative energy on writing for the theatre; some of his earlier critical writing, in essays such as "Poetry and Drama",<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/poetryanddrama029231mbp|title=Poetry And Drama|first=T. S.|last=Eliot|date=1 January 2000|publisher=Faber And Faber Limited.|access-date=26 January 2017|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> "Hamlet and his Problems",<ref name=Hamlet /> and "The Possibility of a Poetic Drama",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/200/sw5.html|title=The Possibility of a Poetic Drama|author= Eliot, T. S. |year= 1921|work= The Sacred Wood: Essays on Poetry and Criticism|publisher=bartleby.com|access-date=26 January 2017}}</ref> focused on the aesthetics of writing drama in verse.

==Critical reception==

===Responses to his poetry===
The writer Ronald Bush notes that Eliot's early poems like "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock", "Portrait of a Lady", "La Figlia Che Piange", "Preludes", and "Rhapsody on a Windy Night" had "[an] effect [that] was both unique and compelling, and their assurance staggered [Eliot's] contemporaries who were privileged to read them in manuscript. [Conrad] Aiken, for example, marveled at 'how sharp and complete and [[sui generis]] the whole thing was, from the outset. The wholeness is there, from the very beginning.'"<ref name="english.illinois.edu" />

The initial critical response to Eliot's ''The Waste Land'' was mixed. Bush notes that the piece was at first correctly perceived as a work of jazz-like syncopation—and, like 1920s [[jazz]], essentially iconoclastic."<ref name="english.illinois.edu"/> Some critics, like [[Edmund Wilson]], [[Conrad Aiken]], and [[Gilbert Seldes]] thought it was the best poetry being written in the English language while others thought it was esoteric and wilfully difficult. Edmund Wilson, being one of the critics who praised Eliot, called him "one of our only authentic poets".<ref name="Wilson, Edmund 1922">Wilson, Edmund, "The Poetry of Drouth". ''The Dial'' 73. December 1922. 611–16.</ref> Wilson also pointed out some of Eliot's weaknesses as a poet. In regard to ''The Waste Land'', Wilson admits its flaws ("its lack of structural unity"), but concluded, "I doubt whether there is a single other poem of equal length by a contemporary American which displays so high and so varied a mastery of English verse."<ref name="Wilson, Edmund 1922"/>

Charles Powell was negative in his criticism of Eliot, calling his poems incomprehensible.<ref>Powell, Charles, "So Much Waste Paper". ''Manchester Guardian'', 31 October 1923.</ref> And the writers of ''Time'' magazine were similarly baffled by a challenging poem like ''The Waste Land''.<ref>''Time'', 3 March 1923, 12.</ref> [[John Crowe Ransom]] wrote negative criticisms of Eliot's work but also had positive things to say. For instance, though Ransom negatively criticised ''The Waste Land'' for its "extreme disconnection", Ransom was not completely condemnatory of Eliot's work and admitted that Eliot was a talented poet.<ref>Ransom, John Crowe. "Waste Lands". ''New York Evening Post Literary Review'', 14 July 1923, pp. 825–26.</ref>

Addressing some of the common criticisms directed against ''The Waste Land'' at the time, Gilbert Seldes stated, "It seems at first sight remarkably disconnected and confused... [however] a closer view of the poem does more than illuminate the difficulties; it reveals the hidden form of the work, [and] indicates how each thing falls into place."<ref>Seldes, Gilbert. "T. S. Eliot". ''Nation'', 6 December 1922. 614–616.</ref>

Eliot's reputation as a poet, as well as his influence in the academy, peaked following the publication of ''The Four Quartets''. In an essay on Eliot published in 1989, the writer [[Cynthia Ozick]] refers to this peak of influence (from the 1940s through the early 1960s) as "the Age of Eliot" when Eliot "seemed pure zenith, a colossus, nothing less than a permanent luminary, fixed in the firmament like the sun and the moon".<ref>{{cite web|first=Cynthia |last=Ozick| url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1989/11/20/t-s-eliot-at-101|title=T.S. ELIOT AT 101|work=The New Yorker|date=20 November 1989|access-date=1 December 2016}}</ref> But during this post-war period, others, like Ronald Bush, observed that this time also marked the beginning of the decline in Eliot's literary influence: <blockquote>As Eliot's conservative religious and political convictions began to seem less congenial in the postwar world, other readers reacted with suspicion to his assertions of authority, obvious in ''Four Quartets'' and implicit in the earlier poetry. The result, fueled by intermittent rediscovery of Eliot's occasional anti-Semitic rhetoric, has been a progressive downward revision of his once towering reputation.<ref name="english.illinois.edu"/></blockquote> Bush also notes that Eliot's reputation "slipped" significantly further after his death. He writes, "Sometimes regarded as too academic ([[William Carlos Williams]]'s view), Eliot was also frequently criticized for a deadening [[neoclassicism]] (as he himself—perhaps just as unfairly—had criticized [[John Milton|Milton]]). However, the multifarious tributes from practicing poets of many schools published during his centenary in 1988 was a strong indication of the intimidating continued presence of his poetic voice."<ref name="english.illinois.edu"/>

Although Eliot's poetry is not as influential as it once was, notable literary scholars, like [[Harold Bloom]]<ref>Bloom, Harold. ''The Western Canon: Books and Schools of the Ages''. NY: Riverhead, 1995.</ref> and [[Stephen Greenblatt]],<ref name=Norton>Stephen Greenblatt, et al. (eds), ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature, Volume 2''. "T.S. Eliot". New York, NY: W.W. Norton & Co.: NY, NY, 2000.</ref> still acknowledge that Eliot's poetry is central to the literary English canon. For instance, the editors of ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature'' write, "There is no disagreement on [Eliot's] importance as one of the great renovators of the English poetry dialect, whose influence on a whole generation of poets, critics, and intellectuals generally was enormous. [However] his range as a poet [was] limited, and his interest in the great middle ground of human experience (as distinct from the extremes of saint and sinner) [was] deficient." Despite this criticism, these scholars also acknowledge "[Eliot's] poetic cunning, his fine craftsmanship, his original accent, his historical and representative importance as ''the'' poet of the modern [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist]]-[[Metaphysical poets|Metaphysical]] tradition".<ref name=Norton />

===Antisemitism===
The depiction of Jews in some of Eliot's poems has led several critics to accuse him of [[antisemitism]]. This case has been presented most forcefully in a study by [[Anthony Julius]]: ''T. S. Eliot, Anti-Semitism, and Literary Form'' (1996).<ref>[[John Gross|Gross, John]]. [https://archive.today/20120731045824/http://www.commentarymagazine.com/viewarticle.cfm/was-t-s--eliot-a-scoundrel--8635 ''Was T.S. Eliot a Scoundrel?''], ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary magazine]]'', November 1996</ref><ref>[[Anthony Julius|Anthony, Julius]]. ''T.S. Eliot, Anti-Semitism, and Literary Form''. Cambridge University Press, 1996 {{ISBN|0-521-58673-9}}</ref> In "[[Gerontion]]", Eliot writes, in the voice of the poem's elderly narrator, "And the jew squats on the window sill, the owner [of my building] / Spawned in some [[wikt:estaminet|estaminet]] of [[Antwerp]]."<ref>Eliot, T. S. "Gerontion". ''Collected Poems''. Harcourt, 1963.</ref> Another well-known example appears in the poem, "Burbank with a Baedeker: Bleistein with a Cigar". In this poem, Eliot wrote, "The rats are underneath the piles. / The jew is underneath the lot. / Money in furs."<ref>Eliot, T. S. "Burbank with a Baedeker: Bleistein with a Cigar". ''Collected Poems''. Harcourt, 1963.</ref> Interpreting the line as an indirect comparison of Jews to rats, Julius writes: "The anti-Semitism is unmistakable. It reaches out like a clear signal to the reader." Julius's viewpoint has been supported by literary critics such as [[Harold Bloom]],<ref>{{cite news

In a series of lectures delivered at the [[University of Virginia]] in 1933 (published in 1934 under the title ''After Strange Gods A Primer of Modern Heresy''), Eliot wrote of societal tradition and coherence, "What is still more important [than cultural homogeneity] is unity of religious background, and reasons of race and religion combine to make any large number of free-thinking Jews undesirable."<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Russell|last=Kirk|author-link=Russell Kirk|url=http://www.touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=04-03-023-v|title=T. S. Eliot on Literary Morals: On T. S. Eliot's ''After Strange Gods''|magazine=[[Touchstone Magazine]]|volume=10|issue=4|date=Fall 1997}}</ref> Eliot never re-published this book/lecture.<ref name = "Dean"/> In his 1934 pageant play ''The Rock'', Eliot distances himself from [[Fascist]] movements of the 1930s by caricaturing [[Oswald Mosley]]'s [[Blackshirt]]s, who "firmly refuse/ To descend to palaver with anthropoid Jews".<ref name=Rock44>T.S. Eliot, ''The Rock'' (London: Faber and Faber, 1934), 44.</ref> The "new evangels"<ref name=Rock44 /> of [[totalitarianism]] are presented as antithetic to the spirit of [[Christianity]].

[[Craig Raine]], in his books ''In Defence of T. S. Eliot'' (2001) and ''T. S. Eliot'' (2006), sought to defend Eliot from the charge of anti-Semitism. Reviewing the 2006 book, Paul Dean stated that he was not convinced by Raine's argument. Nevertheless, he concluded, "Ultimately, as both Raine and, to do him justice, Julius insist, however much Eliot may have been compromised as a person, as we all are in our several ways, his greatness as a poet remains."<ref name = "Dean"/> In another review of Raine's 2006 book, the literary critic [[Terry Eagleton]] also questioned the validity of Raine's defence of Eliot's character flaws as well as the entire basis for Raine's book, writing, "Why do critics feel a need to defend the authors they write on, like doting parents deaf to all criticism of their obnoxious children? Eliot's well-earned reputation [as a poet] is established beyond all doubt, and making him out to be as unflawed as the [[Gabriel|Archangel Gabriel]] does him no favours."<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Terry|last=Eagleton|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/rainessterilethunder/|title=Raine's Sterile Thunder|magazine=[[Prospect Magazine|Prospect]]|date=22 March 2007}}</ref>
