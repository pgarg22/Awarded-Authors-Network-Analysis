In 1968, she joined the [[United States Marine Corps]] as a computer specialist, attaining the rank of 1st Lieutenant while on active duty.<ref name="aas890413">{{cite news |first=A.F. |last=Ebbers |newspaper=[[Austin American-Statesman]] |title=Writer wins award; Marine Corps tour helped publish book |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AASB&p_theme=aasb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EAD89627550A99F&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |date=April 13, 1989 |access-date=2012-06-25}}</ref> She married Richard Sloan Moon in 1969 and they have a son, Michael, born in 1983.<ref name="bio self">Moon, Elizabeth.
