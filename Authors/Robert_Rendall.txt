In 1946 he semi-retired from business, and devoted his life to his scientific and cultural interests, and fishing.

whether scientific, archaeological, theological or literary - were rooted in Orkney, and
a love of the islands drove the rigour which he applied to each of his chosen areas".<ref name="Simon W Hall">{{cite web |url= http://theses.gla.ac.uk/2365/01/2004HallSimonphd-1.pdf|title=The History of Orkney Literature |work=Thesis |publisher=[[University of Glasgow]]|accessdate=2012-08-08}}</ref>

==Critical Opinion==

It has been said that the poetry of Robert Rendall "represents the eventual regenerative reaction to the transplanted, anglicised expression which had prevented Orkney from producing any significant or lasting poetry during the nineteenth century ... The work represents
a cultured fusion of Orcadian vernacular, philosophical Christian content and refined
form".<ref>Simon W Hall</ref>

George Mackay Brown's view was that the poetic work of Rendall was patchy, but when good it was very good indeed.<ref>Maggie Fergusson p. 95</ref>  And the poem ''Renewal'' was one of the most perfect sonnets he knew.<ref>Maggie Fergusson p. 125</ref>

[[Ron Ferguson (writer)|Ron Ferguson]], the writer, says that he is a poet of substance, and that his best poems are in the Orcadian dialect.<ref>Ron Ferguson p. 59,60</ref>
