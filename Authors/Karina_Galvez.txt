"The Avowal", the English version in micro-theatre format of Karina Galvez' [[monologue]] "I Swear I Will" (about [[domestic violence]]) debuted on June 9, 2017 at the CEN (Centro Ecuatoriano Norte-Americano) in Urdesa, Guayaquil, directed by Argentinian theatre director Victor Acebedo.

On October 23, 2017, the Major Council of Chiefs and Communes of Chiloé (in [[Chiloé Archipelago]], in [[Los Lagos Region]], [[Chile]]) through Resolution #7, granted Karina Galvez the title of "Williche de Chiloé Por Gracia" (Williche of Chiloé by Grace), to acknowledge her work for Latin American culture and for the Williche people around the world, a title that essentially means that she was received as a member of the [[Huilliche people]].

Although her poetry is mostly romantic, Karina Gálvez often surprises the reader with poems and [[Prose poetry]] that reflect an acute perception of social issues like abortion, social class clashes, social turmoil, and lack of [[Toleration|tolerance]], or with poems of profound historical content, like her epic poem "La Batalla del Pichincha" ('The [[Battle of Pichincha]]'), or about Catholic beliefs, like her poem "Ave, Mi Guadalupana" that tells of the apparitions of [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]], or with eco-poems (poems about the [[ecology]]), [[Tongue-twister]]s, and even '[[culinary]] poems' containing traditional Ecuadorian recipes in rhyme.

"This author was also recognized with the Crystal Condor, top award given at the 'Ecuadorian Achievement Awards' to an Ecuadorian who shines beyond the boundaries of Ecuador".<ref>Vanidades Continental Magazine, Ecuador, February 1999, Year 39, Number 5, Page 19, "Poetry and Songs"</ref>
