==Biography==

===Early life===
As a teen, Silver attended [[Stagedoor Manor]] Performing Arts Training Center in upstate [[New York (state)|New York]].  He graduated from the [[New York University]] (NYU) Tisch School of the Arts.<ref name=backstage>Horwitz, Simi.

===Career===
Many of his early plays were originally produced [[off-off-Broadway]] at the Vortex Theatre in New York.  Later, his plays premiered at [[Off-Broadway]] venues such as the [[Vineyard Theatre]] and [[Playwrights Horizons]]. Silver noted: "My first real break came when the artistic director of the Woolly Mammoth Theatre in Washington, D.C. happened to walk in and saw, 'Fat Man in Skirts.'"<ref name=backstage/> Several of his plays received  premieres at the [[Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company]] in Washington, DC, including ''[[Fat Men in Skirts]]'' (1991), ''[[Free Will and Wanton Lust]]'' (January 1993)<ref>Rose, Lloyd. "Theater;'Free Will's' Flip Sides;Frenetic Pain and Mirth At Woolly Mammoth", ''The Washington Post'', January 19, 1993</ref> and ''The Food Chain'' (1993-94 season).<ref>[http://www.woollymammoth.net/performances/production_history.php "Wooly Mammoth History"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703085934/http://www.woollymammoth.net/performances/production_history.php |date=2013-07-03 }} woollymammoth.net, accessed April 5, 2012</ref> In her review of ''Fat Men in Skirts'' at Woolly Mammoth Theatre for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[Lloyd Rose]] wrote: "Silver is a modern American absurdist in the tradition of John Guare or Harry Kondoleon, but more of a lowbrow. His go-for-the-laugh instincts are as naked as any sitcom writer's. The dizzying, rather wonderful thing about "Fat Men in Skirts" is that such a shallow technique is made to serve such a deep and anguished vision. Silver never met a pain he couldn't laugh at."<ref>Rose, Lloyd. " 'Fat Men': Big Laughs, Politely Spoken", ''The Washington Post'', June 17, 1991, Style, p. C1</ref>
 
''[[Pterodactyls]]'' was produced Off-Broadway at the Vineyard Theatre in October 1993. [[Ben Brantley]] wrote in his ''[[New York Times]]'' review: "His grimly witty play 'Pterodactyls' recycles all the cliches of the unraveling all-American family and scales them up to the point that they become poignantly grotesque symbols of a species on the verge of extinction... staged with firecracker snap by David Warren and illuminated by several incandescent performances, 'Pterodactyls' offers, for its first three-quarters, as much antic fizz as any comedy in town."<ref>Brantley, Ben. [http://theater.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=9F0CE0D91539F932A15753C1A965958260 "Review/Theater: Pterodactyls; Mining the Humor From the Decline of a Class"] ''The New York Times'', October 21, 1993</ref> ''Pterodactyls'' gained additional recognition in the media because the play was produced with large dinosaurs by sculptor [[Jim Gary]] in its sets. ''Raised in Captivity'' was produced at the Vineyard Theater in March 1995. Ben Brantley wrote in his ''New York Times'' review: "The roads to alienation, as modern literature can testify, are many and varied. But they have seldom been mapped out with the fearless combination of comic artifice and heart-wrenching empathy that Mr. Silver brings to them. 'Raised in Captivity' is about guilt, redemption and self-punishment, and against all odds, it is also very funny."<ref>Brantley, Ben. [http://theater.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=990CE7D91E3FF932A35750C0A963958260 "Theater Review. RAISED IN CAPTIVITY; Alienation, AIDS and Murder, But Keeping a Sense of Humor"] ''The New York Times'', March 1, 1995</ref>

His plays ''Pterodactyls'' and ''Raised in Captivity'' received back-to-back [[Drama Desk Award]] nominations for Outstanding Play in 1994 and 1995, respectively.

His play ''The Food Chain'' ran Off-Broadway at the Westside Theatre in August 1995 to June 1996, (initially produced at the Woolly Mammoth Theatre) with direction by [[Robert Falls]] and a cast that featured [[Hope Davis]], [[Patrick Fabian]] and [[Phyllis Newman]]. Ben Brantley in his ''New York Times'' review wrote: "In 'The Food Chain,' Nicky Silver's toxic, fractured tale of sex, loneliness and the importance of being thin, the pursuit of love is an even more convoluted process than usual. It's hard, after all, to forge a relationship when all you can really hear is the sound of your own voice. For the poisonously funny, image-obsessed Manhattanites in the play, all the world's a mirror. It's no accident that much of this breathless comedy of neuroses at the Westside Theater is made up of monologues, even though there are nearly always at least two people onstage."<ref>Brantley, Ben.

==Critical analysis==
In the preface to his interview with Silver, David Savran locates Silver's work in the tradition of dark [[farce]] created by gay playwrights such as [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Joe Orton]], and [[Christopher Durang]].<ref>Savran, David.  ''The Playwright’s Voice: American Dramatists on Memory, Writing and the Politics of Culture''.  New York: Theatre Communications Group, 1999.</ref>  Theatre scholar Jordan Schildcrout has noted the recurring theme of the [[Parable of the Prodigal Son|prodigal son]] in Silver's plays, and sees Todd in ''Pterodactyls'' as a symbolic figure who challenges and subverts [[Homophobia|homophobic]] stereotypes used to vilify gay men during the AIDS crisis.<ref>Schildcrout, Jordan.
