==Biography==
Jan Twardowski was born on 1 June 1915 in [[Warsaw]], [[Congress Poland]]. His parents were Jan Twardowski and Aniela Maria Konderska. Several weeks after his birth, due to the events of [[World War I]], his family moved to [[Russia]] After 3 years, they returned to Warsaw. He finished middle school in 1935.
In 1932 he began working with the youth newspaper "Kuźnia Młodych" ("Forge of the Young"). He had his own column there, for which he wrote poems, short stories, and interviewed various writers.

After middle school, he began studying literature at the [[Warsaw University|Józef Piłsudski University]] (University of Warsaw). In 1937 he published his first book of poetry.

During [[World War II]] he took part in various operations organised by the [[Armia Krajowa]] and fought in the [[Warsaw Uprising]].

After the war, he joined a [[seminary]] and began studying [[theology]] at the [[Warsaw University]]. He became a priest in 1948. In 1959 he became a [[provost (religion)|provost]] of the [[Visitationist Church]]. His writings were published in a popular Polish Catholic magazine, [[Tygodnik Powszechny]]. He gained fame in 1960 after publishing his first poetry book, "Znak Ufności" ("The Sign of Trust"). In 1980 he received the [[PEN Club]] and [[Robert Graves]] lifetime achievement awards, and, in 1996, the [[Order Uśmiechu]] (The Order of the Smile).
