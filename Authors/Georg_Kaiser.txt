'''Friedrich Carl Georg Kaiser''', called '''Georg Kaiser''', (25 November 1878 – 4 June 1945) was a German dramatist.

==Biography==
Kaiser was born in [[Magdeburg]].

He was highly prolific and wrote in a number of different styles. An [[Expressionism (theatre)|Expressionist]] dramatist, he was, along with [[Gerhart Hauptmann]], the most frequently performed playwright of the [[Weimar Republic]].{{sfn|Banham|1995}} Georg Kaiser's plays include ''The Burghers of Calais'' (1913), ''[[From Morning to Midnight]]'' (1912), and a trilogy, comprising ''The Coral'' (1917), ''Gas'' (1918), ''Gas II'' (1920).

He died in [[Ascona]], Switzerland, and was buried in [[Morcote]] near [[Lugano]].

==Work==
''The Burghers of Calais'' (''Die Bürger von Calais''), written in 1913, was not performed until 1917. It was Kaiser's first success.{{sfn|Banham|1995}} The play is very dense linguistically, with its [[dialogue]] comprising numerous emotive [[monologues]] influenced by the Telegramstil poetics of [[August Stramm]]. Like Kaiser's other works of the period, it bears the mark of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s philosophy, calling upon the modern individual to transcend mediocrity through extraordinary actions; the Expressionist 'New Man' became a commonplace of the genre.

''[[From Morn to Midnight]]'', filmed by [[Karlheinz Martin]] in 1920, was written in 1912 and first performed in 1917. One of the most frequently performed works of German Expressionist theatre, its plot concerns a Cashier (played by [[Ernst Deutsch]] in Martin's film) in a small bank in W. (ostensibly [[Weimar]]) who is alerted to the power of money by the visit of a rich Italian lady. He embezzles 60,000 Marks and absconds to B. ([[Berlin]]) where he attempts to find transcendent experiences in sport, romance and religion, only to be ultimately frustrated.

Kaiser's classic Expressionist plays, written just before and during [[World War I]], often called for man to make a decisive break with the past, rejuvenating contemporary society. He eschewed characterization, and particularly character psychology, instead making his protagonists and other characters [[archetypes]], employing highly anti-[[Naturalism (literature)|naturalistic]] dialogue often comprising lengthy individual speeches.

Kaiser's drama ''Side by Side'' (''Nebeneinander'', 1923), a 'people's play' (''Volksstück''), premiered in Berlin on 3 November 1923, directed by [[Berthold Viertel]] with [[Scenic design|design]] by [[George Grosz]]. With this play Kaiser moved away from the Expressionism of his previous works. Utilizing a more rounded characterization and more realistic curt, comic dialogue to tell a light-hearted story of an idealistic pawnbroker caught up in the [[Hyperinflation#The 1920s German inflation|hyperinflation]] afflicting Germany at the time (the currency stabilization came a fortnight after the play opened), the play inaugurated the 'new sobriety' (''[[New Objectivity|Neue Sachlichkeit]]'') in the drama. "Kaiser has left the cloud that used to surround him," a review in the ''Weltbühne'' suggested, "and landed with both feet on the earth."{{sfn|Willett|1996|p=85}}{{sfn|Banham|1995}}

Kaiser's plays, particularly ''From Morning to Midnight'', were highly influential on the German dramatists operating during the 1920s, including [[Iwan Goll]], [[Ernst Toller]] and [[Bertolt Brecht]], who drew on Kaiser's use of revue-type scenes and parable, which was influenced by medieval and 16th-century German [[mystery play]]s.

Kaiser collaborated with the composer [[Kurt Weill]] on his one-act operas ''[[Der Protagonist]]'' (1926) and ''[[Der Zar lässt sich photographieren]]'' (1928), also ''[[Der Silbersee]]'' (1933).

In his later years, he further developed his criticism of the modern machine age that had characterised the ''Gas'' trilogy. Imprisoned briefly in 1923 for stealing a loaf of bread during the hyper-inflationary crisis, Kaiser fled to [[Switzerland]] when the [[Nazism|Nazis]] came to power in the 1930s (Kaiser went into exile in 1938). There he turned to writing verse dramas on mythological themes, including [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]], [[Amphitryon]], and [[Bellerophon]], and a pacifist drama, ''[[The Soldier Tanaka]]'' (1940).

''The Raft of the Medusa'' (1945) is a play written in verse that reverses the ethos of ''The Burghers of Calais'' in a more pessimistic direction; to avoid bad luck, thirteen children on a life-raft drown the youngest of them.{{sfn|Banham|1995}} (See the [[French frigate Méduse (1810)|frigate ''Méduse'']] for the historical shipwreck and ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'' for its famous depiction in art.)
