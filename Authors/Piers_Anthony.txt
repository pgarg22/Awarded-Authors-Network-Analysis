'''Piers Anthony Dillingham Jacob''' (born 6 August 1934)<ref>Anthony, Piers. Bio of an Ogre, Ace Books, 1988. p 5</ref> is an English-American author in the [[science fiction]] and [[Fantasy (genre)|fantasy]] genres, publishing under the name '''Piers Anthony'''. He is best known for his [[:Category:Xanth books|long-running novel series]] set in the [[fictional realm]] of [[Xanth]].

Many of his books have appeared on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]], and he claims one of his greatest achievements has been to publish a book beginning with every letter of the alphabet, from ''[[Anthonology]]'' to ''[[Zombie Lover]]''.

==Early life==
Anthony's parents, Alfred and Norma Jacob, were [[Quaker]] pacifists studying at Oxford University who interrupted their studies in 1936 to undertake relief work on behalf of the Quakers during the [[Spanish Civil War]], establishing a food kitchen for children in Barcelona.<ref name="mendlesohn">{{cite thesis|last=Mendlesohn|first=Farah|author-link=Farah Mendlesohn|title=Practicing Peace: Quaker Relief work in the Spanish Civil War|url=https://www.academia.edu/7263891/Practicing_Peace_Quaker_Relief_work_in_the_Spanish_Civil_War|type=DPhil|publisher=[[University of York]]|year=1997|access-date=29 May 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Maul |first1=Daniel |title=The politics of neutrality: the American Friends Service Committee and the Spanish Civil War, 1936–1939 |journal=European Review of History: Revue européenne d'histoire |date=2016-01-02 |volume=23 |issue=1-2 |pages=82–100 |doi=10.1080/13507486.2015.1121972|doi-access=free }}</ref> Piers and his sister were left in England in the care of their maternal grandparents and a nanny.<ref>Anthony, Piers.  ''How Precious Was That While: An Autobiography'', Tor Books (2001), p.12</ref> Alfred Jacob, although a British citizen, had been born in America near [[Philadelphia]], and in 1940, after being forced out of Spain and with the situation in Britain deteriorating, the family sailed to the United States. In 1941 the family settled in a rustic "back to the land" [[utopian]] community near [[Winhall, Vermont]], where a young Piers made the acquaintance of radical author [[Scott Nearing]], a neighbor.<ref>Joly, Greg and Rebecca Lepkoff. ''Almost Utopia'', Vermont Historical Society, 2008.</ref> Both parents resumed their academic studies, and Alfred eventually became a professor of Romance languages, teaching at a number of colleges in the Philadelphia area.

Piers was moved around to a number of schools, eventually enrolling in [[Goddard College]] in [[Vermont]] where he graduated in 1956.<ref>Anthony, Piers. Bio of an Ogre, Ace Books, 1988. p. 87</ref> On ''[[This American Life]]'' on 27 July 2012, Anthony revealed that his parents had divorced, he was bullied, and he had poor grades in school. Anthony referred to his high school as a "very fancy private school", and refuses to donate money to it. He recalls being part of "the lower crust", and that no one paid attention to, or cared about him.  He said, "I didn't like being a member of the underclass, of the peons like that".<ref name=tal>{{cite episode | url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/470/show-me-the-way | transcript=Transcript | transcript-url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/470/transcript | series=[[This American Life]] | title=470: Show Me The Way | date=27 July 2012 | access-date=27 March 2015}}</ref>

==Marriage and early career==
Anthony met his future wife, Carol Marble, while both were attending college. They were married in 1956, the same year he graduated from [[Goddard College]], and he worked in a series of [[wikt:odd job|odd job]]s. In 1957, Anthony decided to join the [[United States Army]], as his wife was now pregnant, and they needed both medical coverage and a steady source of income. During his two-year enlistment, he became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1958 <ref>{{cite book |last=Denney |first=Jim |title=Quit Your Day Job!: How to Sleep Late, Do What You Enjoy, and Make a Ton of Money as a Writer! |publisher=Quill Driver Books |year=2003 |page=24 |isbn=978-1-884956-04-1}}</ref> and  became an editor and cartoonist for his battalion's newspaper.

After completing military service, he briefly taught school at [[Admiral Farragut Academy]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]] before deciding to try to become a full-time writer.<ref>Anthony, Piers. Bio of an Ogre, Ace Books, 1988. p. 284</ref>

Anthony and his wife made a deal: if he could sell a piece of writing within one year, she would continue to work to support him. But if he could not sell anything in that year, then he would forever give up his dream of being a writer. At the end of the year, he managed to get a short story published. He credits his wife as the person who made his writing career possible, and he advises aspiring writers that they need to have a source of income other than their writing in order to get through the early years of a writing career.<ref>{{cite book|last=Anthony|first=Piers|title=Anthonology|year=1985|publisher=Tom Doherty Associates|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-312-93027-1|edition=1st|page=[https://archive.org/details/anthonology00anth/page/10 10]|type=Hardcover|chapter=Introduction to the story "Possible to Rue"|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/anthonology00anth/page/10}}</ref>

==Writing==
On multiple occasions Anthony has moved from one publisher to another (taking a profitable hit series with him) when he says he felt the editors were unduly tampering with his work. He has sued publishers for accounting malfeasance and won judgments in his favor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bookseriesinorder.com/piers-anthony/|title= Book Series in Order Profiles: Piers Anthony|access-date=4 March 2018}}</ref> Anthony maintains an Internet Publishers Survey in the interest of helping aspiring writers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hipiers.com/publishing.html|title=Piers Anthony's Internet Publishing}}</ref> For this service, he won the 2003 "Friend of EPIC" award for service to the electronic publishing community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epicauthors.org/epicon.html|title=EPIC - Electronically Published Internet Connection|website=www.epicauthors.org|access-date=2018-02-03}}</ref>  His website won the ''Special Recognition for Service to Writers'' award from Preditors and Editors, an author's guide to publishers and writing services.<ref>Gogolewski, Kathe.

His popular novel series Xanth has been optioned for movies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/screens/2004-12-10/241547/|title=Film News}}</ref> It inspired the [[DOS]] video game ''[[Companions of Xanth]]'', by [[Legend Entertainment]]. The same series also spawned the board game ''Xanth'' by [[Mayfair Games]].

Anthony's novels usually end with a chapter-long Author's Note, in which he talks about himself, his life, and his experiences as they related to the process of writing the novel. He often discusses correspondence with readers and any real-world issues that influenced the novel.

Since about 2000, Anthony has written his novels in a [[Linux]] environment.<ref>Howell, Dean.

==In other media==
Act One of episode 470 of the radio program ''[[This American Life]]'' is an account of boyhood obsessions with Piers Anthony. The act is written and narrated by writer Logan Hill who, as a 12-year-old, was consumed with reading Anthony's novels. For a decade he felt he must have been Anthony's number one fan, until, when he was 22, he met "Andy" at a wedding and discovered their mutual interest in the writer. Andy is interviewed for the story and explains that, as a teenager, he had used escapist novels in order to cope with his alienating school and home life in [[Buffalo, New York]]. In 1987, at age 15, he decided to run away to Florida in order to try to live with Piers Anthony. The story includes Anthony's reflections on these events.<ref name=tal/>

[[Naomi King]], the daughter of writer [[Stephen King]], enjoyed reading books by Piers Anthony, which included things like pixies, imps and fairies. After she told her father, "Dad, I just don't like those to be scared. Would you write something with dragons in it?", he wrote ''[[The Eyes of the Dragon]]'' which was originally published in 1984 and later in 1987 by [[Viking Press]].{{fact|date=May 2021}}

==''But What of Earth?''==
Early in Anthony's literary career, there was a dispute surrounding the original publication (1976) of ''But What of Earth?''.  Editor [[Roger Elwood]] commissioned the novel for his nascent science-fiction line [[Laser Books]]. According to Anthony, he completed ''But What of Earth?'', and Elwood accepted and purchased it. Elwood then told Anthony that he wished to make several minor changes, and in order not to waste Anthony's time, he had hired copy editor (and author) [[Robert Coulson]] to retype the manuscript with the changes. Anthony described Coulson as a friend and was initially open to his contribution.

However, Elwood told Coulson he was to be a full collaborator, free to make revisions to Anthony's text in line with suggestions made by other copy editors. Elwood promised Coulson a 50–50 split with Anthony on all future royalties. According to Anthony, the published novel was very different from his version, with changes to characters and dialog, and with scenes added and removed. Anthony felt the changes worsened the novel. Laser's ultimate publication of ''But What of Earth?'' listed Anthony and Coulson together as collaborators. Publication rights were reverted to Anthony under threat of legal action. In 1989, Anthony (re)published his original ''But What of Earth?'' in an annotated edition through [[Tor Books]]. This edition contains an introduction and conclusion setting out the story of the novel's permutations and roughly 60 pages of notes by Anthony giving examples of changes to plot and characters, and describing some of the comments made by copy editors on his manuscript.<ref>{{cite book | first=Piers | last=Anthony | title=But What of Earth? | date=15 July 1989 | isbn=978-0812530988 | url=https://archive.org/details/butwhatofearth00pier }}</ref>

==Controversy==
Throughout the 2010s, numerous science fiction community sources published analyses and editorials describing Anthony's writings as [[sexist]], [[misogynistic]], and [[pedophilic]].  The treatment of women, particularly in the early [[Xanth]] series, came under scrutiny.  In a piece for the website ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', Jason Heller claimed that female characters in the books are treated "as obstacles, props, and objects of lust and condescension."<ref>Heller, J. (2013, 18 October). Revisiting the sad, Misogynistic fantasy of Xanth. Retrieved 7 March 2021, from https://www.avclub.com/revisiting-the-sad-misogynistic-fantasy-of-xanth-1798241312</ref>

==Personal life==

He and his first wife, Carol Ann Marble Jacob, had two daughters, Penelope "Penny" Carolyn and Cheryl. Penny died in 2009, due to complications from skin cancer, and Cheryl has one child named Logan. Carol Ann died at home 3 October 2019 due to what is suspected to be heart related complications due to a 15 year long battle with [[chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy]] (CIDP).<ref>{{cite web |last=Anthony |first=Piers |date=1 November 2019 |url=http://www.hipiers.com/19nov.html|title=NoRemember 2019|publisher=HiPiers|access-date=14 May 2020}}</ref>

==Religious beliefs ==
Regarding his religious beliefs, Anthony wrote in the October 2004 entry of his personal website, "I'm [[agnostic]], which means I regard the case as unproven, but I'm much closer to the [[atheist]] position than to the [[theist]] one."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.hipiers.com/04oct.html | first=Piers | last=Anthony | title=Ogre's Den: From the Desk of Piers Anthony, OctOgre 2004 | date=October 2004 | access-date=19 March 2015}}</ref> In 2017 he stated, "I am more certain about God and the Afterlife: they don't exist."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.hipiers.com/17may.html | first=Piers | last=Anthony | title=Ogre's Den: From the Desk of Piers Anthony, Mayhem 2017 | date=May 2017 | access-date=26 May 2016}}</ref>
