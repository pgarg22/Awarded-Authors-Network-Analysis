==Early life==
Minghella was born in [[Ryde]], on the [[Isle of Wight]], an island off the south coast of England that is a popular holiday resort. His family are well known on the Island, where they ran a café in Ryde until the 1980s and have run an eponymous business making and selling [[Gelato|Italian-style]] [[ice cream]] since the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Meet the Minghellas|url=http://www.minghella.co.uk/meettheminghellas.php|publisher=Minghella Icecream|access-date=7 December 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209205807/http://www.minghella.co.uk/meettheminghellas.php|archive-date=9 December 2014}}</ref> His parents were Edoardo Minghella (an Italian immigrant) and Leeds-born Gloria Alberta (née Arcari).<ref>{{cite book|editor=Mario Falsetto|title=Anthony Minghella: Interviews|pages=135ff|date=2013|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson|isbn=9781617038211}}, from ''Minghella on Minghella''</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Gloria Minghella obituary|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10755696/Gloria-Minghella-obituary.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=22 August 2015}}</ref> His mother's ancestors originally came from [[Valvori]], a small village in southern [[Lazio]], Italy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/67/Anthony-Minghella.html|title=Anthony Minghella bio|access-date=7 July 2009|publisher=Filmreference.com}}</ref><ref name=oxfr1>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-100058 Minghella, Anthony], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' {{Subscription required}}<br />{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/14/movies/14brea.html|work=The New York Times|first=Sarah|last=Lyall|title=In the Spotlight, Two Sides of London|date=14 December 2006}}.</ref> He was one of five children, a sister being [[Loretta Minghella]], and a brother [[Dominic Minghella]] who would also become a screenwriter and producer.

Minghella attended St. Mary's Catholic Primary School, Ryde, Sandown Grammar School, and [[St John's College, Portsmouth]]. Early interests suggested a possible career as a musician,<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/mar/18/filmnews.theatrenews | title = Guardian Obituary | access-date = 9 January 2017 }}</ref> with Minghella playing keyboards with local bands Earthlight and Dancer.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.progarchives.com/artist.asp?id=3783 | title = Dancer biography at ProgArchives | access-date = 9 January 2017 }}</ref> The latter recorded an album titled ''Tales of the Riverbank'' in 1972, although it was not released until 2001.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.progarchives.com/album.asp?id=18730 | title = Tales of the Riverbank | access-date = 9 January 2017 }}</ref>

Minghella graduated after three years, and stayed on to pursue a PhD. He also taught at the university for several years, on [[Samuel Beckett]] and on the [[medieval theatre]]. Ultimately, he abandoned his pursuit of a PhD to work for the [[BBC]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.starpulse.com/Actors/Minghella,_Anthony/Biography/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=25 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927011944/http://www.starpulse.com/Actors/Minghella,_Anthony/Biography/ |archive-date=27 September 2015  }}; viewed 24 January 2014.</ref>

==Career==
Minghella's debut work was a stage adaptation of Gabriel Josipovici's ''Mobius the Stripper'' (1975) and it was his ''Whale Music'' (1985) that brought him notice.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.hollywood.com/celebrity/Anthony_Minghella/190042 | title = Anthony Minghella at Hollywood.com | access-date = 7 July 2009 | work = Hollywood.com}}</ref> His double bill of [[Samuel Beckett]]'s ''Play'' and ''Happy Days'' was his directorial debut and debut feature film as a director was ''[[A Little Like Drowning]]'' (1978). During the 1980s, he worked in television, starting as a [[Television crew#runner|runner]] on ''[[Magpie (TV series)|Magpie]]'' before moving into [[script editor|script editing]] the children's drama series ''[[Grange Hill]]'' for the [[BBC]] and later writing ''[[The Storyteller (TV series)|The Storyteller]]'' series for [[Jim Henson]]. He wrote several episodes of the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] detective drama ''[[Inspector Morse (TV series)|Inspector Morse]]'' and an episode of long-running ITV drama ''[[Boon (TV series)|Boon]]''. ''[[Made in Bangkok]]'' (1986) found mainstream success in the [[West End theatre|West End]].

Radio success followed with a [[Giles Cooper Awards|Giles Cooper Award]] for the radio drama ''Cigarettes and Chocolate''<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00b62ff |title=BBC – BBC Radio 4 Programmes – Saturday Play, Cigarettes and Chocolate |access-date=7 July 2009 |work=[[BBC News]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314214657/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00b62ff |archive-date=14 March 2010 }}</ref> first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 1988. It was revived on 3 May 2008 as a tribute to its author director following his death. His production starred [[Juliet Stevenson]], [[Bill Nighy]] and Jenny Howe. His first radio play ''Hang Up'', starring [[Anton Lesser]] and Juliet Stevenson, was revived on 10 May 2008 as part of the BBC Radio 4 Minghella season.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/20523/bbc-radio-to-air-minghella-play-season | title = BBC radio to air Minghella play season | date = 25 April 2008 | access-date = 7 July 2009 | work = [[The Stage]] | last = Hemley | first = Matthew}}</ref>

''[[Truly, Madly, Deeply]]'' (1990), a feature drama written and directed for the BBC's ''[[Screen Two]]'' anthology strand, bypassed TV broadcast and instead had a cinema release. He turned down an offer to direct another Inspector Morse to do the project, even though he believed that the Morse episode would have been a much higher-profile assignment. ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]'' (1996) brought him two [[Academy Awards]] nominations, Best Director (which he won) and [[Academy Award for Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay)|Adapted Screenplay]]. He also received an Adapted Screenplay nomination for ''[[The Talented Mr. Ripley (film)|The Talented Mr. Ripley]]'' (1999).

''[[The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency (TV series)|The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency]]'', a pilot episode television adaptation which he co-wrote and directed, was broadcast posthumously on [[BBC One]] (23 March 2008); watched by 6.3&nbsp;million viewers. He vocally supported ''I Know I'm Not Alone'', a film of musician [[Michael Franti]]'s peacemaking excursions into [[Iraq]], [[Palestinian territories|Palestine]] and [[Israel]]. He directed a [[party election broadcast]] for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in 2005. The short film depicted [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]] working together and was criticised for being insincere: "The Anthony Minghella party political broadcast last year was full of body language fibs", said Peter Collett, a psychologist at the [[University of Oxford]]. "When you are talking to me, I'll give you my full attention only if I think you are very high status or if I love you. On that party political broadcast, they are staring at each other like lovers. It is completely false."<ref>{{cite news | last = Henderson | first = Mark | title = The science behind their mutual dislike | work = The Times | date = 6 September 2006 | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article629340.ece | access-date = 18 March 2008|location=London}}</ref>

With Samuel Beckett's 100th birthday celebrations, he returned to radio on [[BBC Radio 3]] with ''Eyes Down Looking'' (2006), with: [[Jude Law]], Juliet Stevenson and [[David Threlfall]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/theverb/pip/rvilt/ | title = BBC – Radio 3 – The Verb – Beckett centenary | date = 1 April 2006 | access-date = 7 July 2009 | publisher = BBC | last = Koek | first = Ariane}}</ref> An operatic directorial debut came with [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]]'s ''[[Madama Butterfly]]''. Premiered at the [[English National Opera]] (London, 2005), then at the [[Lithuanian National Opera and Ballet Theatre]] (Vilnius, March 2006) and at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] (New York City, September 2006). The latter was transmitted live into cinemas worldwide (7 March 2009) as part of the [[Metropolitan Opera Live in HD|Met's HD series]] and is now available on DVD. The ENO work was to have led to other operatic projects, directing again at English National Opera and collaborating with [[Osvaldo Golijov]] on a new opera for the Met and ENO, writing the libretto and directing the production.<ref name="parry"/>

He was honoured with the naming of The Anthony Minghella Theatre at the [[The Quay Arts|Quay Arts Centre]] ([[Isle of Wight]]). He made an appearance in the 2007 film ''[[Atonement (2007 film)|Atonement]]'' as a television host interviewing the novelist central to the story.

His last work was the screenplay of [[Nine (2009 live-action film)|the film adaptation of]] the Tony Award-winning musical ''[[Nine (musical)|Nine]]'' (1982); [[Arthur Kopit]] (book) and [[Maury Yeston]] (score). It is based on the film ''[[8½]]''. He shared credit with [[Michael Tolkin]] on the screenplay.

The Film, Theatre & Television department at the University of Reading, opened in 2012, was named in his honour.
