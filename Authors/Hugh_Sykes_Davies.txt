'''Hugh Sykes Davies''' (17 August 1909 – 6 June 1984)<ref name="Eagle">[https://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Eagle/Eagle%20Volumes/1980s/Eagle_1985.pdf 'The Eagle', vol. LXX, no. 293 (Easter 1985), pp. 61-4]. ''joh.cam.ac.uk''. Retrieved 11 October 2021.</ref> was an English poet, novelist and communist, who was one of a small group of 1930s British [[Surrealism|surrealists]].

== Biography==
Davies was born in [[Prescot]], [[Merseyside]] (then in [[Lancashire]]), to a Methodist minister and his wife. He went to [[Kingswood School]], [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], and read the Classics and English Triposes at [[St John's College, Cambridge]],<ref>'University News', ''Times'', 18 June 1931, p. 16.</ref> where he co-edited a student magazine called ''Experiment'' with [[William Empson]]. Following graduation he was awarded both the Jebb Studentship and the Le Bas Essay Prize. In 1933 he was elected the first-ever fellow of English at St John's College, and three years later he was appointed a University Lecturer in the subject. While at Cambridge he was a member of the [[Cambridge Apostles|Apostles]].<ref name="obit">'Obituary: Mr Hugh Sykes Davies', ''Times'', 8 June 1984, p. 18.</ref>

Davies spent some time in Paris during the 1930s, and in 1936 he was one of the organisers of the [[London International Surrealist Exhibition]], where he met the artist [[Salvador Dalí]]. His poems were mostly published in ''avant garde'' magazines and were not collected during his lifetime; his best known was arguably ''Petron'' (1935). His novels include ''Full Fathom Five'' (1956) and ''The Papers of Andrew Melmoth'' (1960), while his works of literary scholarship include ''Realism in the Drama'' (his prize-winning entry for the Le Bas competition; 1933), ''Surrealism'' (1936), ''Macaulay's Marginalia to Lucretius'' (1937) and ''Grammar Without Tears'' (1951).

Politically Davies was of the left, and he intended to stand as a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidate for [[Isle of Ely (UK Parliament constituency)|Isle of Ely]] in the anticipated 1940 general election, but his prospective candidature was terminated when the party found out that he was also a member of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain|Communist Party]]. During World War II he was employed at the [[Ministry of Food]], which gave him an insight into administrative problems; perhaps consequently, he lost much of his youthful utopianism, and in the 1950s renounced his communist affiliation and reverted to a more orthodox social democracy in its stead.<ref name="Eagle"/><ref name="obit"/>

==Personal life==
Davies had a talent for friendship, and in addition to Empson and Dalí he numbered [[T. S. Eliot]], [[I. A. Richards]], [[Anthony Blunt]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] amongst his circle. At one stage he had [[Malcolm Lowry]] declared his ward in an attempt to stop Lowry's drinking. He appears in the [[National Film Board of Canada|National Film Board of Canada's]] feature-length documentary ''[[Volcano: An Inquiry into the Life and Death of Malcolm Lowry]]'' (1976), where he talks about Lowry and their friendship.

Davies died at St John's College in [[Cambridge]] on 6 June 1984, after recovering several months earlier from a serious operation.<ref name="Eagle"/> He was married five times to four different women, the first of whom was the poet [[Kathleen Raine]].<ref>[[George Watson (scholar)|George Watson]], [http://jacketmagazine.com/20/hsd-watson.html 'Remembering Prufrock: Hugh Sykes Davies, 1909–1984'], ''Sewanee Review'', vol. 109, no. 4 (Fall 2001).
