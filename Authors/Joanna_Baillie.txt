==Early life==
===Background===
Baillie was born on 11 September 1762 in [[Bothwell]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |last=MacPherson|first=Hamish |date=9 November 2021 |title=A look into the women of the Scottish Enlightenment |url=https://www.thenational.scot/culture/19703291.look-women-scottish-enlightenment/ |url-status=live |access-date=2021-11-22 |website=The National |page=21 |language=en}}</ref> Her mother, Dorothea Hunter (c. 1721–1806) was a sister of the Scottish physicians and anatomists [[William Hunter (anatomist)|William]] and [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]]. Her father, Rev. James Baillie (c. 1722–1778), was a Presbyterian minister, and in his last two years Professor of Divinity at the [[University of Glasgow]]. Her aunt, [[Anne Hunter|Anne Home Hunter]], was a poet.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Six Gothic Dramas |last=Baillie |first=Joanna |publisher=Valancourt Books |others=Selected and introduced by Christine A.

The Baillies were an old Scottish family which claimed descent from the Scottish patriot, [[Sir William Wallace]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/news/joanna-baillie-poet-playwright-plays-on-the-passions-scotland-william-wallace-google-doodle-a8531251.html |title=Who was the Scottish poet and playwright Joanna Baillie? |work=The Independent |access-date=2018-09-11 |language=en-GB}}</ref><ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911 |inline=1 |wstitle=Baillie, Joanna |volume=3 |pages=219–220}}</ref> Wallace is not known to have had any children, however.

Joanna Baillie was the youngest of three children: her twin sister died unnamed as a baby, her sole surviving sister was [[Agnes Baillie|Agnes]] (1760–1861), and her elder brother [[Matthew Baillie]] became a London physician. Baillie was no dedicated scholar. Her early passions were for the Scottish countryside. She had her own pony and her interest in stories was demonstrated by plays she created and stories she told. At home she was dealt with strictly and displays of anger or glee were discouraged. She was not taken to the theatre. The only drama she saw was a puppet show.<ref name=":0"/>

In 1769 the family moved to [[Hamilton, South Lanarkshire|Hamilton]], where her father was appointed to the collegiate church. Baillie did not learn to read until the age of ten, when she attended Miss McDonald's Glasgow boarding school<ref name=":2"/> ostensibly known for "transforming healthy little hoydens into perfect little ladies" (Carswell 266). She was said to have had 'an epiphany' when she first attended a theatre.<ref name=":2"/> From then she wrote plays and poems, as well as demonstrated her abilities in mathematics, music and art.<ref name=":0"/>

Baillie's father died in 1778 and their financial position decreased, although Matthew went on to study medicine at [[Balliol College, Oxford]]. The rest of the family retreated to [[Long Calderwood]] near [[East Kilbride]]. They returned in 1784,<ref name=":0"/> as her uncle [[William Hunter (anatomist)|Dr William Hunter]] had died the year before and her brother had been left a London house and his collection, which is now the [[University of Glasgow|University of Glasgow's]] [[Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery]]. Her aunt, [[Anne Hunter]], was a society hostess and a poet, and through her Baillie was introduced to the [[bluestocking]]s [[Fanny Burney]], [[Elizabeth Carter]], and [[Elizabeth Montagu]]. She studied [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]], [[Jean Racine|Racine]], [[Molière]], [[Voltaire]] and Shakespeare, and wrote plays and poetry while running their brother's household until he married in 1791. Her works were not published until that time, and even then anonymously, after both her father and uncle William had died in 1783.<ref name=":2"/>

Joanna and her sister and mother moved houses several times, before settling in [[Colchester]], where she began her ''Plays on the Passions''. In 1802 they moved to Hampstead, after her brother had inherited a considerable sum of money,<ref name=":2"/> where she would live with her sister for the next half-century. Neither sister married.<ref name=":0"/><ref name="EB1911"/>  Her aunt Anne Home Hunter introduced her to London literary society, after in 1800, a re- print of her work revealed her identity.<ref name=":2"/> In 1806 Mrs Baillie died. [[Anna Laetitia Barbauld]] and her niece [[Lucy Aikin]] were neighbours and close friends. She wrote letters to [[Sir Walter Scott]] and they would  visit and stay with each other; he wrote a prologue to her 1810 production of ''The Family Legend''.<ref name=":0">{{Cite ODNB |title=Baillie, Joanna |last=Clarke |first=Norma |date=30 May 2013 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/1062}}</ref>

When she reached her seventies, Baillie experienced a year of ill health, but recovered and returned to writing and correspondence, and included Scottish folk songs in her ''Fugitive Verses'' written in her eighties (in 1840).<ref name=":2"/>

"[Joanna Baillie] was anxious that all her works with the exception of her theological pamphlet (see '''Religious writing''') be collected in a single volume, and had the satisfaction of seeing this 'great monster book' as she called it, which appeared in 1851, shortly before she died. Though no longer robust — 'Ladies of four score and upwards cannot expect to be robust, and need not be gay. We sit by the fireside with our books' (Carhart, 62) — she had remained in good health until the end. She died in 1851 in Hampstead, having almost reached her ninetieth year. Her sister, Agnes, lived on to be 100. Both sisters were buried alongside their mother in Hampstead parish churchyard, and in 1899 a sixteen-foot-high memorial was erected in Joanna Baillie's memory in the churchyard of her birthplace at Bothwell."<ref name=":0"/>

==Literary and dramatic works==
===Poetry===
*'''1790''' Baillie's first publication was ''Poems: Wherein it is Attempted to Describe Certain Views of Nature and of Rustic Manners''. She later revised a selection of these early poems, which were reprinted in her ''Fugitive Verses'' (1840). Her first poem, "Winter Day", evoked winter sights and sounds in the neighbourhood of Long Calderwood.
*'''1821''' Her ''Metrical Legends of Exalted Characters'' told in verse the heroic stories of such historical figures as [[William Wallace]], [[Christopher Columbus]], and [[Lady Grizel Baillie]]. They were inspired in part by the popularity of Walter Scott's heroic ballads, her enthusiasm for which had made writing drama "less interesting for a time" (Baillie, ''Memoirs'').
*'''1836''' Three volumes of ''Dramatic Poetry''
*'''1840''' Encouraged by her old friend, the banker poet [[Samuel Rogers]], Baillie issued a new collection, [[Fugitive Verses]], some of which were old and some recently written. It was generally agreed that her popular songs, especially those in Scots, would live on.
*'''1849''' Baillie published the poem ''Ahalya Baee'' for private circulation. It subsequently appeared as ''Allahabad'' in 1904.

===Plays===
*'''1790''' A tragedy, ''Arnold'', which was never published
*"A serious comedy", which was later burnt
*''Rayner'' was heavily revised before it was published in ''Miscellaneous Plays'' (1804).
*'''1791''' ''Plays on the Passions'' first conceived
*'''1798''' The first volume of ''Plays on the Passions'' was published anonymously as ''A Series of Plays''. Volume 1 consisted of ''Count Basil,'' a tragedy on love, ''The Tryal,'' a comedy on love, and ''De Monfort,'' a tragedy on hatred. 
In a long introductory discourse, the author defended and explained her ambitious design to illustrate each of the deepest and strongest passions of the human mind. The plays, the author explained, were part of a still larger design and completely original concept, arising from a particular view of human nature, in which sympathetic curiosity and observation of the movement of feeling in others were paramount. Real passion, "genuine and true to nature", was to be the subject; each play was to focus on the growth of one master passion.<ref name="Baillie2001">{{Cite book |author=Joanna Baillie |title=Plays on the Passions |url=https://archive.org/details/aseriesplaysinw06bailgoog |date=19 February 2001 |publisher=Broadview Press |isbn=978-1-55111-185-8}}</ref> This unusually analytical and arguably artificial approach generated much discussion and controversy, and in "a week or two ''Plays on the Passions'' was a main topic... in the best literary circles" (Carswell 273). The whole of London was excited to figure out who the author could be. Authorship was attributed to a male until someone pointed out that all of the protagonists were middle-aged women, rarely the muses of male authors (Carswell 274). Baillie finally revealed herself as the author in 1800, in the title-page of the third edition.
*'''1800''' ''De Monfort'' was produced at Drury Lane with [[John Philip Kemble|John Kemble]] and [[Sarah Siddons]] in the leading roles. Splendidly staged, the play ran for eight nights, but was not a theatrical success. 
*'''1802''' The second volume of ''Plays on the Passions'' was published under Joanna Baillie's name, with a preface acknowledging the reception given to volume one: "praise mixed with a considerable portion of censure". Volume 2 consisted of ''The Election'', a comedy on hatred, ''Ethwald'', a tragedy in two parts on ambition, and ''The Second Marriage'', a comedy on ambition. Baillie saw these plays, especially ''Ethwald'', as exemplifying her best writing.
*'''1804''' A volume entitled ''Miscellaneous Plays''; the tragedies ''Rayner'' and ''Constantine Paleologus'', and a comedy, ''The Country Inn''
*'''1810''' The Scottish-themed ''Family Legend'', produced at [[Edinburgh]] under the patronage of [[Sir Walter Scott]], had a brief though brilliant success. It included a prologue by Scott and an epilogue by [[Henry Mackenzie]]. Its success encouraged the theatre managers to revive ''De Monfort'', which was also well received.
*'''1812''' A third and final volume of ''Plays on the Passions'' consisted of two gothic tragedies, ''Orra'' and ''The Dream'', a comedy, ''The Siege'', and a serious musical drama, ''The Beacon''. The tragedies and comedy represented the passion of Fear, while the musical drama represented Hope. Introducing what she called "probably the last volume of plays I shall ever publish," she explained that she intended to complete her project by writing further dramas on the passions of Remorse, Jealousy and Revenge, but did not intend to publish them, as publication had discouraged stage production.
*'''1815''' ''The Family Legend'', produced at [[Drury Lane]], London
*'''1821''' ''De Monfort'' [sic] was produced at [[Drury Lane]], London, with [[Edmund Kean]] in the title role. ''Constantine Paleologus'', though written with John Kemble and [[Sarah Siddons]] in mind, was declined by Drury Lane. It was produced at the Surrey Theatre as a melodrama, ''Constantine and Valeria'', and in its original form at Liverpool, Dublin and Edinburgh.
*'''1836''' Three volumes of ''Miscellaneous Plays'' were published. They included nine new plays, and the continuation of ''Plays on the Passions'' promised earlier: a tragedy and comedy on jealousy and a tragedy on remorse. Their publication created a stir, and critics were almost all enthusiastic and welcoming. ''Fraser's Magazine'' declared, "Had we heard that a MS play of Shakespeare's, or an early, but missing, novel of Scott's, had been discovered, and was already in the press, the information could not have been more welcome" (''Fraser's Magazine'', p. 236).

Baillie's reputation does not rest entirely on her dramas; she also authored poems and songs admired for their beauty. Considered the best are the ''Lines to Agnes Baillie on her Birthday'', ''The Kitten'', ''To a Child'' and some of her adaptations of Scottish songs, such as ''Woo'd and Married an'a{{`}}''. Scattered through the dramas are some lively and beautiful songs: ''The Chough'' and ''The Crow'' in ''Orra'', and the lover's song in ''The Phantom''.<ref name="EB1911"/> Her poem ''A Mother to her Waking Infant'' was thought 'closely observed' from watching interaction of babies and mothers in her circle.<ref name=":2"/>

==Defending her stage plays==
Initially, Baillie was reluctant to publish her works. In a letter to Sir Walter Scott, she wrote, "Were it not that my Brother has expressed a strong wish that I should publish a small vol: of poetry, I should have very little pleasure in the thought."<ref>Slagle, pp. 369–370.</ref> This shyness is in keeping with her humble, contented disposition. She did not seek acclaim for her poems, but simply wrote them for enjoyment. Ironically, they have become better known than her plays.

However, in an 1804 prefatory address in ''Miscellaneous Plays'', Baillie defended her plays as acting plays. The criticism that she had no understanding of practical stagecraft and that her plays were torpid and dull in performance rankled throughout her life, and she was always delighted to hear of a production being mounted, no matter how humble it might be. She believed that critics had unfairly labelled her work as [[closet drama]], partly because she was a woman and partly because they had failed to read her prefaces with care. She pointed also to the conventions of the theatre in her time, when lavish spectacle on huge stages was the order of the day. Her own plays, with their attention to psychological detail, worked best, she argued, in well-lit small theatres where facial expressions could clearly be seen. She wrote, "I have wished to leave behind me in the world a few plays, some of which might have a chance of continuing to be acted even in our canvas theatres and barns."<ref>{{Cite book |title=Miscellaneous Plays |last=Baillie |first=Joanna |year=1804 |location=London|pages=v}}</ref> It is clear that Baillie wanted her plays to be acted, not just read.

==Religious writing==
Growing up as a Presbyterian minister's daughter, religion had always been important to Baillie. In 1826 she published ''The Martyr'', a tragedy on religion, intended for reading only. In 1831 she entered into public theological debate with a pamphlet, ''A view of the general tenour of the New Testament regarding the nature and dignity of Jesus Christ'', where she analysed the doctrines of order in the [[Trinity]], [[Arianism]], and [[Socinianism]].

==Philanthropy and literary advice==
Financially secure herself, Joanna Baillie customarily gave half her earnings from writing to charity, and engaged in many philanthropic activities. In the early 1820s she corresponded with a [[Sheffield]] campaigner, [[James Montgomery (poet)|James Montgomery]], in support of his efforts on behalf of [[chimney sweep]]s. She declined to send a poem, fearing that was "just the very way to have the whole matter considered by the sober pot-boilers over the whole kingdom as a fanciful and visionary thing," whereas "a plain statement of their miserable lot in prose, accompanied with a simple, reasonable plan for sweeping chimneys without them" was far better strategically (letter, 5 Feb 1824).<ref>{{Cite book |last=Baillie |first=Joanna |title=Further Letters of Joanna Baillie |year=2010 |publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press |location=Madison |isbn=978-0-8386-4149-1 |pages=95 |editor=Thomas McLean}}</ref>

Where literary matters were concerned, Joanna Baillie had a shrewd understanding of publishing as a trade. She took seriously the influence her eminence gave her, and authors down on their luck, women writers, and working-class poets like the shoemaker poet John Struthers applied to her for assistance. She wrote letters, drew on all her contacts, and used her knowledge of the literary world to advise or to further a less well-connected writer. In 1823, she edited and published by subscription a collection of poems by many leading writers of the day, in support of a widowed old school friend with a family of daughters to support.<ref>Thomas McLean (June 2016). "Donation and Collaboration: Joanna Baillie's A Collection of Poems, Chiefly Manuscript, and From Living Authors, April 1823". ''BRANCH: Britain, Representation and Nineteenth-Century History''. Dino Franco Felluga, ed. ''Extension of Romanticism and Victorianism on the Net''. Retrieved 10 August 2018.</ref>

Baillie befriended the eccentric American writer, critic and activist [[John Neal (writer)|John Neal]], after reading his article "[[John Neal (writer)#Feminism|Men and Women]]" in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' in October 1824. He in turn admired Baillie's poems and plays and welcomed the attention from the more established literary figure.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sears |first=Donald A. |title=John Neal |publisher=Twayne Publishers |location=Boston, Massachusetts |year=1978 |isbn=080-5-7723-08 |page=99}}</ref>

Wordsworth himself considered Baillie the "ideal gentlewoman", despite the fact that she was Scottish (Zell 19). Her most famous work ''DeMonfort'' helped to inspire Lord Byron's closet drama ''Manford'' (Strand 1). Byron went on to value her advice, calling her "the only dramatist since Orwan" (Zell 19). In 1806 Baillie solidified a friendship with Scott and she and her sister would often visit Scotland (Strand 1).

==Reputation and legacy==
Few women writers have received such praise for their personal qualities and literary powers as Joanna Baillie. She had intelligence and integrity allied to a modest demeanour that made her, for many, the epitome of a Christian gentlewoman. She was shrewd, observant of human nature, and persistent to the point of obstinacy in developing her views and opinions. Her brand of drama remained essentially unchanged throughout her life, and she took pride in having carried out her major work, the ''Plays on the Passions'', more or less in the form she had originally conceived. Her inventive faculties were widely remarked upon by "practically everybody whose opinion on a literary matter was worth anything".,<ref>Carswell 275.</ref> and she was on friendly terms with the leading women writers of her time.

The American critic and writer [[John Neal (writer)|John Neal]] referred to Baillie in an 1866 ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' article as the "female Shakespeare of a later age".<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=December 1866 |title=John Pierpont |last=Neal |first=John |author-link=John Neal (writer) |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=chi.43049378&view=1up&seq=659 |magazine=Atlantic Monthly |location=Boston, Massachusetts |publisher=Atlantic Monthly Co |volume=18 (July–December 1866) |page=650}}</ref>

[[John Stuart Mill]], in his ''Autobiography'', recalled that in childhood, Baillie's ''Constantine Paleologus'' seemed to him "one of the most glorious of human compositions" He continued to see it "one of the best dramas of the last two centuries".

Two ''songs'' from ''Ethwald'', ''Hark! the cock crows'' and ''Once upon my cheek he said the roses grew'', were set to music by the English composer [[John Wall Callcott]].

One of her few detractors was [[Francis Jeffrey]], who in 1803 published a long condemnatory review of the ''Plays on the Passions'' in the [[Edinburgh Review]]. He attacked the narrow theory, practice and purpose of the plays. Though he praised her "genius", Baillie marked Jeffrey down as a literary enemy and refused a personal introduction. Not until 1820 would she agreed to meet him; but they then became warm friends.

[[Maria Edgeworth]], recording a visit in 1818, summed up her appeal for many: ''Both Joanna and her sister have most agreeable and new conversation, not old, trumpery literature over again and reviews, but new circumstances worth telling, apropos to every subject that is touched upon; frank observations on character, without either ill-nature or the fear of committing themselves; no [[blue-stocking]] tittle-tattle, or habits of worshipping or being worshipped.''<ref>Hare, p. 268.</ref>

Joanna Baillie offered a new way of looking at drama and poetry. Revered by poets on both sides of the Atlantic, many of her contemporaries placed her above all women poets except [[Sappho]]. According to [[Harriet Martineau]] she had "enjoyed a fame almost without parallel, and... been told every day for years, through every possible channel, that she was second only to Shakespeare."<ref>Martineau, p. 358</ref> Works of hers were translated into [[Sinhala language|Singhalese]] and German, and she was performed widely in both the United States and Britain.

Yet even when Martineau met her in the 1830s, that fame seemed to belong to a bygone era. There were no revivals of her plays in the 19th or 20th centuries, though her tragedies might seem suited to the intimacy of television or film. Not until the late 20th century did critics began to recognize how her intimate depictions of the human psyche had influenced Romantic literature. Scholars now recognize her importance as a stage innovator and dramatic theorist, and critics and literary historians of the Romantic period concerned with reassessing the place of women writers acknowledge her significance.

Joanna Baillie was great friends with Lady Byron. This friendship led her to be close friends and colleagues with Lord Byron as well. Lord Byron even attempted to get one of her plays to be performed at Drury Lane, sadly to no avail.<ref>Slagle, p. 343.</ref> Their friendship continued until a domestic division arose between Lord and Lady Byron, leaving Baillie to take the side of her friend. After this, she was more critical of Lord Byron and his work, calling his characters "untrue to nature and morally bankrupt"<ref>Brewer 180.</ref> While they were still polite to each other as literary contemporaries, their friendship did not return.

One of those Baillie corresponded with most was Sir Walter Scott. The two wrote enough letters to each other to fill a sizeable volume. Scott appreciated and supported Baillie as a literary contemporary, but their relationship did not stop there. Their letters are full of personal details and conversations about their families. While they both respected each other's work, their friendship was deeper than just professional.<ref>Slagle</ref><ref>See Joanna Baillie's ''Dramatic and Poetical Works'' (London, 1851).</ref>

On 11 September 2018, to commemorate what would have been her 256th birthday, Google released a [[Google Doodle]] celebrating her,<ref name=":1"/> and her work has 'enjoyed a resurgence of popularity' in recognition of her circumstances.<ref name=":2"/>
