'''David Carroll Eddings''' (July 7, 1931 – June 2, 2009<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.fictionmatters.com/2009/06/03/david-eddings-dead-at-77/|title=David Eddings, Dead at 77|last=Robb|first=P. Bradley|date=2009-06-03|publisher=Fiction Matters|access-date=2009-06-03}}</ref>) was an American [[fantasy]] writer. With his wife [[Leigh Eddings|Leigh]], he authored several best-selling  [[high fantasy|epic fantasy]] novel series, including ''[[The Belgariad]]'' (1982–84), ''[[The Malloreon]]'' (1987–91), ''[[The Elenium]]'' (1989–91), ''[[The Tamuli]]'' (1992–94), and ''[[The Dreamers (novel series)|The Dreamers]]'' (2003–06).

Eddings grew up near [[Puget Sound]] in the City of Snohomish.<ref>[[The Malloreon#Sorceress of Darshiva|Sorceress of Darshiva]]</ref> After graduating from [[Snohomish High School]] in 1949, he worked for a year before majoring in speech, drama and English at junior college.<ref>David and Leigh Eddings, The Rivan Codex, {{ISBN|0006483496}}, p. 9</ref> Eddings displayed an early talent for drama and literature, winning a national oratorical contest, and performing the male lead in most of his drama productions. He graduated with a BA from [[Reed College]] in 1954. He wrote a novel for a thesis at Reed College, ''How Lonely Are The Dead'', before being drafted into the U.S. Army.<ref name="auto">David and Leigh Eddings, The Rivan Codex, {{ISBN|0006483496}}, p. 10</ref> (He had also previously served in the National Guard.)<ref name="starlog210">{{cite magazine |last=Nicholls |first=Stan |author-link=Stan Nicholls |date=January 1995 |editor-last=McDonnell |editor-first=David |title=Ring Bearer |url=https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-210 |magazine=[[Starlog]] |issue=210 |page=76-81 |issn=0191-4626}}</ref> After being discharged in 1956, Eddings attended the graduate school of the [[University of Washington| University of Washington in Seattle]] for four years, graduating with an MA in 1961 after submitting a novel in progress, ''Man Running'', for his thesis.<ref>David and Leigh Eddings, The Rivan Codex, {{ISBN|0006483496}}, p. 3</ref> Eddings then worked as a purchaser for [[Boeing]], where he met his future wife, then known as Judith Leigh Schall.<ref name="auto" />  They married in 1962, and through most of the 1960s, Eddings worked as an Assistant Professor at [[Black Hills State College]] in South Dakota.

The couple adopted one boy in 1966, Scott David, then two months old.<ref name="queencitymail-1966mar"/><ref name="queencitymail-1970may"/> They adopted a younger girl between 1966 and 1969.<ref name="queencitymail-1970may"/> In 1970 they lost custody of both children and each were sentenced to a year in jail in separate trials after pleading guilty to [[physical abuse|physical]] [[child abuse]].<ref name="blackhillsweekly-1970feb"/> Though the abuse, the trial, and the sentencing were all extensively reported in South Dakota newspapers at the time, these details did not resurface in media coverage of the couple during their successful joint career as fantasy authors beginning in the 1980s.  The abuse only returned to public attention several years after both had died.

After both served their sentences, David and Leigh Eddings moved to Denver in 1971, where David found work in a grocery store.<ref name="themodernistreview.co.uk">{{cite web|last=Gifford|first=James|date=2016-09-30|url=https://gifford.mla.hcommons.org/2017/08/26/a-frightful-hobgoblin//|title=A Frightful Hobgoblin Stalks Through Modernism?|access-date=7 October 2016}}</ref>

Eddings had completed the first draft of his first published novel, ''High Hunt'', in March 1971 while serving his jail term.<ref>https://gifford.mla.hcommons.org/2020/02/03/on-reading-monsters/#13n</ref> ''High Hunt'' was a contemporary story of four young men hunting deer, and like many of his later novels, it explores themes of manhood and coming of age. Convinced that being an author was his future career, after a short period in Denver, David and Leigh Eddings moved to Spokane where he once again relied on a job at a grocery shop for his funds. ''High Hunt'' was published in early 1972 by [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]] to modestly positive reviews.<ref>https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/david-eddings/high-hunt/</ref> Eddings continued to work on several unpublished novels, including ''Hunseeker's Ascent'', a story about mountain climbing, which was later burned as Eddings claimed it was "a piece of tripe so bad it even bored me."<ref name="auto1">David and Leigh Eddings, The Rivan Codex, {{ISBN|0006483496}}, p. 11</ref> Most of his attempts followed the same vein as ''High Hunt'': adventure stories and contemporary tragedies. None were sold or published, with the eventual exception of ''The Losers'' which tells the story of God and the Devil, cast in the roles of a one-eyed Indian and Jake Flood. Though written in the 1970s, ''The Losers'' was not published until June 1992, well after Eddings' success as an author was established.<ref name="starlog210" />

Eddings doodled a fantasy map one morning before work. According to Eddings, several years later, upon seeing a copy of [[J. R. R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', in a bookshop, he muttered, "Is this old turkey still floating around?", and was shocked to learn that it was in its 78th printing. However, he had already included Tolkien's work in the syllabuses for at least three sections of his English Literature survey courses in the summer of 1967 and the Springs of 1968 and 1969.<ref name="themodernistreview.co.uk"/> Eddings subsequently began to annotate his previous doodle, which became the geographical basis for the country of Aloria.<ref name="auto1"/> Over the course of a year he added names to various kingdoms, races, and characters, and invented various theologies and a mythology, all of which counted about 230 pages. Because the ''Lord of the Rings'' had been published as three books, Eddings believed fantasy in general was supposed to be trilogies. He initially laid out ''The Belgariad'' as a trilogy as well, until his editor [[Lester del Rey]] told him the booksellers would refuse to accept 600-page books. Instead del Rey suggested the series should be published as five books. Eddings at first refused, but having already signed the contract, and with Del Rey's promise that he would receive advances for five books instead of three, eventually agreed.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~cjwatson/eddings/interview.html |title=Guardians of the West: An Interview with David Eddings - Chiark |access-date=2018-10-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181012083706/http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~cjwatson/eddings/interview.html |archive-date=2018-10-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  ''[[Pawn of Prophecy]]'', the first volume in the series, was issued in April 1982.

''The Belgariad'' series of books (published in five volumes between 1982 and 1984) were popular, and Eddings would continue to produce fantasy material for the rest of his life, usually producing a book every year or two.  By 1995, new books were credited jointly to David and Leigh Eddings; Eddings explained in a brief foreword that their working together as authors "had been the case from the beginning." This is generally accepted to be broadly accurate,<ref name="PWrivan">{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=The Rivan Codex: Ancient Texts of the Belgariad and the Malloreon.|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-345-42402-0|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=25 January 2021|website=[[Publishers Weekly]]|language=en}}</ref><ref name="dammassa">{{Cite book|last=D'Ammassa|first=Don|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FdS-zQEACAAJ|title=Masters of Fantasy: Volume II|date=11 August 2020|publisher=Independently Published|isbn=979-8-6730-5251-8|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Palmer-Patel, Charul|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1125007425|title=The Shape of Fantasy : Investigating the Structure of American Heroic Epic Fantasy|publisher=|year=|isbn=978-0-429-19926-4|edition=|location=[New York]|page=171|oclc=1125007425}}</ref> although Eddings scholar James Gifford notes that collaboration would have been "impossible" with Eddings' first published novel ''High Hunt'', as David Eddings' own notes show that the first draft was completed while he and Leigh were both in different jails, about half-way through their terms.<ref>https://gifford.mla.hcommons.org/2020/02/03/on-reading-monsters/#13</ref>

The Eddings' final work, the novel series ''[[The Dreamers (novel series)|The Dreamers]]'', was published in four volumes between 2003 and 2006.

On January 26, 2007 Eddings accidentally burned about a quarter of his office, next door to his house, along with his [[Excalibur (automobile)|Excalibur]] sports car. He was flushing the fuel tank of the car with water when he lit a piece of paper and threw it into the puddle to test if it was still flammable. When asked to explain it to the firefighter he said "One word comes to mind. Dumb."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nevadaappeal.com/article/20070126/NEWS/101260101 |author=F.T.

On February 28, 2007, David Eddings' wife, Leigh Eddings, who he married in 1962, died following a series of strokes that left her unable to communicate. She was 69.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.elbakin.net/fantasy/news/3407-Deces-De-Leigh-Eddings| title=Décès de Leigh Eddings| publisher=Elbakin.net| year=2007| access-date=2007-03-06}}</ref> Eddings cared for her at home with her mother after her first stroke, which occurred three years before he finished writing ''The Dreamers''.<ref name="themodernistreview.co.uk"/>

Eddings resided in [[Carson City, Nevada]], where he died of natural causes on June 2, 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/fantasy-writer-david-eddings-dies|title=Fantasy writer David Eddings dies|last=Neill|first=Graeme|date=2009-06-03|publisher=Bookseller.com|access-date=2009-06-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/6420ap_nv_obit_eddings.html?source=mypi|title=Fantasy writer Eddings dies|date=2009-06-04|newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|access-date=2009-06-05}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

Dennis, Eddings' brother, said that he had been ill with dementia for a long time, but his health had been on a very fast downhill slide since September, and he required 24-hour care. He also confirmed that in his last months, his brother had been working on a manuscript that was unlike any of his other works, stating "It was very, very different. I wouldn't call it exactly a satire of fantasy but it sure plays with the genre". The unfinished work, along with his other manuscripts, went to his alma mater, Reed College,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nevadaappeal.com/article/20090604/NEWS/906039854/1070&ParentProfile=1058|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612023231/https://www.nevadaappeal.com/article/20090604/NEWS/906039854/1070%26ParentProfile%3D1058|url-status=dead|archive-date=12 June 2009|title=Fantasy writer David Eddings dies in Carson City home|work=The Nevada Appeal|access-date=19 August 2015}}</ref> along with a bequest of $18 million to fund "students and faculty studying languages and literature."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/education/index.ssf/2009/07/fantasy_writer_leaves_reed_18.html |work=The Oregonian |title=Fantasy writer David Eddings leaves Reed College $18 million |date=2009-07-15}}</ref> Eddings also bequeathed $10 million to the [[National Jewish Medical and Research Center]] in [[Denver]] for pediatric asthma treatment and research; Eddings' wife Leigh had asthma throughout her life.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_12856825 |work=Denver Post |first=Claire |last=Trageser |title=Late author leaves $10 million to National Jewish |date=2009-07-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718230708/http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_12856825 |archive-date=2009-07-18}}</ref>
