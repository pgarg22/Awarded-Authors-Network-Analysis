'''Mário Cesariny de Vasconcelos''' or '''Mário Cesariny''' (August 9, 1923 – November 26, 2006) was a Portuguese [[surrealist]] poet and painter. He published several major works of poetry during a career spanning 50 years. Cesariny was also a [[painting|painter]], but his work became more centered on poetry in the 1950s.

==Biography==
Mário Cesariny was born in [[Lisbon]], Portugal, the youngest child and only son of Viriato de Vasconcelos and María de las Mercedes Cesariny, a Spaniard of French but originally Italian ancestry.

Mário Cesariny studied in the prestigious [[Escola de Artes Decorativas António Arroio]] and also studied music with the composer [[Fernando Lopes Graça]]. Later he joined the [[Académie de la Grande Chaumière]] in Paris, where he met [[André Breton]] in 1947. He soon became influenced by the French surrealist movement and was one of the biggest supporters of the movement in Portugal, where he founded the Lisbon Surrealist Movement with other Portuguese artists including [[Alexandre O'Neill]] and [[José-Augusto França]].

After being acquainted with the surrealist movement, Cesariny moved away from the [[Neorealism (art)|neorealist]] movement, important at the time in the country for being composed mainly by members of the resistance against the fascist leaning regime of [[Oliveira Salazar]]. He adopted an attitude of constant experimenting in his work. This principle is the main characteristic of his work and has been present throughout his career.

From 1960 until [[Carnation Revolution|April 25, 1974]], Cesariny was mercilessly harassed by the Portuguese [[Polícia Judiciária]] for being a suspect of [[vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]], a euphemistic term used by the police in those days for [[homosexuality]], which the poet lived courageously in spite of persecution. This fact shows up several times in his writings in a veiled way ("Lisboa-os-Sustos") and was one of the causes of his intermittent stayings in Great Britain and France during the 1960s and 1970s. Later he talked publicly about this.<ref>[https://bibliomanias.no.sapo.pt/dosjornais.htm#Entrevista%20a%20Mário%20Cesariny Cesariny interview, January 2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030418133417/http://bibliomanias.no.sapo.pt/dosjornais.htm |date=2003-04-18 }} and [https://sol.sapo.pt/PaginaInicial/Cultura/Interior.aspx?content_id=12486 Cesariny last interview in 2006 (audio)]</ref>
