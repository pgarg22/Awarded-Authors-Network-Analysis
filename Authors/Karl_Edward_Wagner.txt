'''Karl Edward Wagner''' (12 December 1945 &ndash; 14 October 1994) was an American writer, poet, editor, and publisher of [[Horror fiction|horror]], [[science fiction]], and [[heroic fantasy]], who was born in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] and originally trained as a [[psychiatrist]].{{citation needed|date=October 2020}} He wrote numerous dark fantasy and horror stories. As an editor, he created a three-volume set of Robert E. Howard's [[Conan the Barbarian]] fiction restored to its original form as written, and edited the long-running and genre-defining ''[[The Year's Best Horror Stories]]'' series for [[DAW Books]]. His [[Carcosa]] publishing company issued four volumes of the best stories by some of the major authors of the so-called Golden Age [[pulp magazine]]s. He is possibly best known for his creation of a series of stories featuring the character [[Kane (fantasy)|Kane]], the Mystic Swordsman.

His disillusionment with the medical profession can be detected in the stories "The Fourth Seal" and "Into Whose Hands". He described his personal philosophy as [[nihilism|nihilistic]], [[anarchism|anarchistic]] and [[absurdism|absurdist]], and claimed, not entirely seriously, to be related to "an opera composer named "[[Richard Wagner|Richard]]".<ref name="Horror' 1994">Interview with ''Horror'' magazine, October 1994.</ref> Wagner also admired the cinema of [[Sam Peckinpah]], stating "I worship the film ''[[The Wild Bunch]]''".<ref name="ma">[[Mike Ashley (writer)|Mike Ashley]], "Wagner, Karl Edward" in ''St. James Guide To Fantasy Writers'', edited by [[David Pringle]]. St. James Press, 1996, p. 583-4.</ref>

==Biography==
Wagner was the fourth and youngest child of Aubrey J. Wagner and Dorothea Huber. His father was an official of the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]. Wagner earned a history degree from Kenyon College in 1967, and a psychiatry degree from [[University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill]]. As noted above, he disliked the medical profession, which he abandoned upon establishing himself as a writer.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

Wagner was productive as both a writer and editor/anthologist; see below. His friends included the writer [[Manly Wade Wellman]], two of whose collections he published with the [[Carcosa]] publishing imprint.

Wagner died in his home in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, on October 14, 1994, essentially due to the consequences of longterm [[alcoholism]].<ref>Stephen Jones, "Raising Kane", in ''Midnight Sun'', 2002, p. 4.</ref><ref>http://weirdfictionreview.com/2012/07/various-encounters-with-karl/</ref> It was reported in a late 1994 issue of the Newsletter of the [[Horror Writers of America]] that Wagner's causes of death were [[heart failure]] and [[liver failure]].<ref>''The HWA Newsletter'' 5, Issue 6 Nov/Dec 1994, p. 9</ref>

''Exorcisms and Ecstasies'',  a posthumous volume of uncollected stories, miscellany, and tributes was published by small press publisher [[Fedogan & Bremer]] in 1997. Night Shade Books has published the complete Kane stories (novels and shorts) in two hardcover volumes.

==Published works==
Some of Wagner's work is set in [[Robert E. Howard]]'s universe (featuring [[Conan the Barbarian]] and [[Bran Mak Morn]]); he also edited three volumes of Howard's original Conan tales, important to purists for being the first to restore the texts to their originally published forms. His three volumes of ''[[Echoes of Valor]]'' also featured restored versions of pulp-era fantasy stories by authors such as [[Fritz Leiber]], [[C. L. Moore]], [[Henry Kuttner]], and [[Nictzin Dyalhis]]. Wagner wrote an unpublished Bran Mak Morn novel, ''Queen of the Night'', which was originally scheduled to be published by Zebra books during 1978 and Ace Books during 1980.<ref>Bibliography in Karl Edward Wagner, ''Exorcisms and Ecstasies", Minneapolis: Fedogan and Bremer, 1997, p. 433, Item A17.</ref>  [Refer to David Drake's Newsletter #105 in which he states 'Queen of the Night' was never written.]

===Kane, the Mystic Swordsman===
Wagner created his own mystical and immortal pre-historical anti-hero, [[Kane (fantasy)|Kane]], whose name and background are based on traditional conceptions of the biblical [[Cain]]. A powerful, left-handed warrior-sorcerer with red hair and blue eyes, the character was described by Wagner as one "who could master any situation intellectually, or rip heads off if push came to shove".<ref name="Horror' 1994"/> Kane is an immortal, somewhat like the [[Wandering Jew]] (or more specifically, [[Charles Maturin]]'s ''[[Melmoth the Wanderer]]'', a novel which Wagner cites as a major influence in his essay "The Once and Future Kane").<ref>Karl Edward Wagner, "The Once and Future Kane" in Wagner, ''Midnight Sun", San Francisco: Night Shade Books, 2003, pp 431-37.</ref> Kane's character also includes elements of Robert E. Howard's [[Solomon Kane]]. He is an immortal, cursed to wander the Earth until he is destroyed by the violence that he himself has created. He sells his loyalty as a fighter to the highest bidder. He is a well-read and intelligent man who has traveled the world for centuries and is able to discuss music, poetry, politics, and many other subjects. He is also amoral and a born killer. The Kane stories are often classified as tales of [[sword and sorcery]] (although Wagner disliked the term), which some critics have compared favorably to those of [[Robert E. Howard]] and [[Michael Moorcock]].<ref name="ma"/> In his story "The Gothic Touch", Kane actually encounters Moorcock's albino anti-hero [[Elric]].<ref>Kramer, Edward and Richard Gilliam (ed). ''Michael Moorcock's Elric: Tales of the White Wolf''. Stone Mountain, GA: White Wolf Publishing, 2004, pp234-50.</ref> The character Kane is considered one of the most memorable and original [[anti-hero]]es of [[heroic fantasy]].<ref name="Stephen Jones 2003 p. 1">. Stephen Jones, "Raising Kane" in ''Midnight Sun'' (2003), p. 1.</ref>

Inspired by the sword and sorcery adventures of [[Fritz Leiber]]'s Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser, and Robert E. Howard's mighty-thewed barbarian Conan the Cimmerian, Wagner set about creating his own fantasy character while still attending medical school. The result was initially published as a 1970 paperback original with a lurid cover by West Coast pornography publisher Powell Publications.<ref name="Stephen Jones 2003 p. 1"/> The novel's text was altered by an unknown copy editor to conform with the cover art.

After publishing a pseudonymous pornographic novel with a small New York company, Wagner relinquished his chance to become a doctor and instead decided to write full-time. During 1973, Warner Paperback library published  ''Death Angel's Shadow'', which collected the three original Kane tales (one novella, one novelette, and one short story). He also began selling his stories and poems regularly to the growing small press magazine market. Several of his tales were published in Gary Hoppenstand's ''Midnight Sunn'', a magazine initially devoted to Kane and the new school of epic fantasy writers. This was followed by publication of the first Kane novel, ''Bloodstone'', during 1975. Warner Books commissioned a cover painting by [[Frank Frazetta]] (who had helped revive the Conan franchise, and who would paint a number of future covers for the series) and Wagner's writing career improved.<ref>Stephen Jones, "Raising Kane" in ''Midnight Sun'' (2003), p. 2.</ref>

After a novel featuring Howard's Pictish hero [[Bran Mak Morn]], Wagner's next Kane book was ''Dark Crusade'' (1976). A Kane story published elsewhere, "Two Suns Setting", won the 1977 [[British Fantasy Award]] and was also a [[World Fantasy Award]] nominee. Wagner published other Kane stories in magazines such as ''Chacal'', ''Whispers'' and ''Escape!'' during 1977. Gerald W. Page, then editor of DAW Books ''Year's Best Fantasy and Horror Stories'', began to reprint Kane tales in the anthology series ''Night Winds''; a collection of six previously published Kane tales followed (Warner Books, 1978). The publisher also reissued all previous Kane books including a new edition of ''Darkness Weaves'', which reinstated the author's preferred text.

''The Book of Kane'' was the last published volume of Kane material (1985) until Night Shade Books' omnibus editions of novels and shorter tales.

A proposed fourth Kane novel, ''In the Wake of the Night'', was never completed, although an excerpt was published as part of a [[World Fantasy Convention]] souvenir book of 1981; this also appears in the collection ''Midnight Sun'' (2003).<ref>Stephen Jones, "The Mark of Kane", introduction to ''Red Harvest'', Chapel Hill, NC: Sidecar Preservation Society, 2002, p.4</ref>

In 2004, it was reported that movie producer Lauren Moews had "acquired ''Death Angel's Shadow'', and will produce a film based upon "Reflections for the Winter of My Soul," the first of three short stories comprising ''Death Angel's Shadow''. The other two short stories, "Cold Light" and "Mirage," are waiting in the wings to be developed into a possible KANE franchise for Tonic Films".  [https://web.archive.org/web/20130617084829/http://movies.about.com/cs/upcomingreleases/a/kanenws021004.htm] As of 2020 the film had not entered production.

===Other writings===

Besides the Kane books, Wagner wrote contemporary horror stories (some of which, like "At First Just Ghostly", also feature Kane). These were collected in the books ''In a Lonely Place'' (1983), ''Why Not You and I?'' (1987) and the posthumous ''Exorcisms and Ecstasies'' (1997). They range from the very literate and allusive (such as "The River of Night's Dreaming", which refers to [[Richard O'Brien]]'s ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]'' and the myth of [[Carcosa]] used in the work of [[Ambrose Bierce]] and [[Robert W. Chambers]]), to the pulpy and parodic (such as "Plan Ten from Inner Space", a crazed homage to [[Ed Wood]]'s ''magnum opus'' ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]''). His later stories, such as "But You'll Never Follow Me" and "Silted In", were described by [[Ramsey Campbell]]<ref>Ramsey Campbell, "Friends Die", tribute essay in ''Exorcisms and Ecstasies'' (1997).</ref> as tormented and deeply personal; some deal explicitly with [[drug addiction]] (e.g. "More Sinned Against") and sexual subjects, including [[psychological repression]] (e.g. "Brushed Away") and [[transsexualism]] (e.g. "Lacunae").

During 1983 Wagner won the [[World Fantasy Award]] for his horror novella "Beyond Any Measure" and the [[British Fantasy Award]] during 1984 for "Neither Brute Nor Human".

With his friends Jim Groce and [[David Drake]], who were concerned that Arkham House would cease publication after the death of its founder, [[August Derleth]], Wagner formed the [[Carcosa]] publishing house in North Carolina during 1973 to preserve the work of their favorite [[pulp magazine]] horror writers in hardcovers. Carcosa Press published four substantial volumes of horror tales: ''[[Murgunstrumm and Others]]'' by [[Hugh B. Cave]], ''[[Far Lands, Other Days]]'' by [[E. Hoffmann Price]], ''[[Worse Things Waiting]]'' and ''[[Lonely Vigils]]'', both by [[Manly Wade Wellman]]. All books were edited by Wagner and illustrated profusely. A fifth collection was planned, ''Death Stalks the Night'', by [[Hugh B. Cave]]; [[Lee Brown Coye]] was working on illustrating it when he died, causing Carcosa to abandon the project. The book was eventually published by [[Fedogan & Bremer]].  Wagner later acted as the literary agent for Manly Wade Wellman's estate.

Wagner collaborated with Drake on ''Killer'', a [[science fiction]] horror novel set during the reign of the [[Roman Emperors|Roman]] emperor [[Domitian]].

The illustrator of ''Murgunstrumm'' and ''Worse Things Waiting'' was the noted ''[[Weird Tales]]'' artist [[Lee Brown Coye]]. Coye's macabre designs, incorporating mysterious lattices of twigs, were the inspiration for Wagner's [[British Fantasy Award]]-winning story "[[Sticks (short story)|Sticks]]". 
 
A connoisseur of rare horror stories, Wagner perspicaciously edited many horror and fantasy [[anthologies]]; perhaps his greatest achievement of this topic was the annual anthology series ''[[The Year's Best Horror Stories]]'' ([[DAW Books]]), which he edited for fourteen years from volume VIII (1980) until volume XXII (1994). The series was canceled after Wagner's death. However, while the original editions were paperback originals, Underwood-Miller preserved the series in a set of three limited-edition hardcovers.

Wagner was a frequent visitor to London to attend fantasy and horror conventions. Though he continued to edit, producing three volumes of the heroic fantasy anthology ''Echoes of Valor'' for Tor Books during the late 1980s and early 1990s, and published a steady sequence of short stories (most of which were apparently written some years earlier), his most productive time was finished.<ref>Stephen Jones, "Raising Kane", in ''Midnight Sun'', 2002, p. 3.</ref> In the story "The Gothic Touch", Kane teams up with the albino warrior-sorcerer [[Elric]] in a tribute anthology honoring the fiction of [[Michael Moorcock]] (''Tales of the White Wolf'').

Wagner wrote several unproduced screenplays and treatments including a film script for ''Conan III'' for movie producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]] and a TV script based on Robert E. Howards "The Horror on the Mound" (for ''Tales from the Darkside'').<ref>Bibliography in ''Exorcisms and Ecstasies'' (1997) p. 453.</ref>

Wagner provided the foreword to "Fat Face", a [[Cthulhu Mythos]] tale by [[Michael Shea (author)|Michael Shea]] published as a standalone book by Axolotl Press, 1987.

====Graphic novels====

Wagner was involved with several comics ventures. His Kane story "In the Lair of Yslsl" (which was later incorporated into the Kane novel ''Dark Crusade'') was adapted by Bill Whitcomb and Steve Vance, and illustrated by Vance, Wes Smith, and Bill Black for the graphic medium in ''Dark Phantasms'' 1, Summer 1976. During 1993 Wagner co-wrote the graphic novel ''Tell Me Dark'' with John Ney Reiber and Kent Williams, contributing original characters and situations. It was published by DC Comics in both hardcover and trade paperback.<ref>Bibliography, in 
 ''Exorcisms and Ecstasies'', p. 453.</ref>

At the time of his death, he had just finished compiling ''Exorcisms and Ecstasies'', and had started working on two novels, ''The Fourth Seal'' and ''Tell Me, Dark'', the latter based on the graphic novel he disowned.<ref>Jacket bio, Karl Edward Wagner, ''Exorcisms and Ecstasies'', Minneapolis: Fedogan and Bremer, 1997.</ref>
