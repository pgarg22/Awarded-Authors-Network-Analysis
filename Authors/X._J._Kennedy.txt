'''X. J.

Kennedy]], he  added an "X" as his first initial.<ref>''Something About the Author'' {{ISBN|0-8103-9372-7}}, University of Michigan, 1996 page 122</ref>

==Early life and academic career==
In his youth, under the name Joe Kennedy, he was an active member of [[science fiction fandom]] and published well-regarded [[science fiction fanzines|fanzines]], including ''Vampire'' (a quarterly, 1945–1947) and the ''Vampire Annuals''. He was a member of several [[amateur press associations]], and co-founded the still-extant Spectator Amateur Press Association (SAPS).<ref>Kennedy, X.J. (as "Joe Kennedy").

Kennedy attended Seton Hall (BSc, 1950) and Columbia University (MA, 1951). After serving for four years as an enlisted journalist with the U.S. Navy's [[United States Fleet Forces Command|Atlantic Fleet]], he studied at the [[Sorbonne]] from 1955 to 1956. Kennedy then spent the next six years pursuing a graduate degree in English at the University of Michigan but did not complete his Ph.D. There he met his future wife Dorothy Mintzlaff, who was a fellow graduate student.

Kennedy taught English at the [[University of Michigan]], the [[University of North Carolina]] at Greensboro, [[Tufts University]] (1963–1978), with visiting professorships at [[Wellesley College]]; the [[University of California, Irvine]]; and the [[University of Leeds]].

==Writing career==
In the early 1970s, Kennedy and his wife Dorothy co-edited the influential journal ''[[Counter/Measures]]'', a precursor in the [[New Formalism|New Formalist]] movement to ''The Reaper'' and ''The Formalist''. He also served as poetry editor of ''[[The Paris Review]]''. Kennedy's poetry has been published in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'', and ''[[The Hudson Review]]''. He became a freelance writer in 1978.

Kennedy is most recognized for his light verse, and was the first recipient of the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]]' [[Michael Braude Award for Light Verse]]. His first book, ''Nude Descending a Staircase'', won the 1961 [[Lamont Poetry Prize]] of the [[Academy of American Poets]], and his dozens of books have won awards, including [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggenheim]] and [[National Council for the Traditional Arts|National Arts Council]] fellowships, a grant from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], the Bess Hokin Prize from ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'' magazine, and a ''Los Angeles Times'' Book Award for poetry (in 1985 for ''Cross Ties: Selected Poems''), the 1969-1970 [[Shelley Memorial Award]], the Golden Rose of the New England Poetry Club, honorary degrees from Lawrence and Adelphi Universities and Westfield State College.  Kennedy received the National Council of Teachers of English Year 2000 Award for Excellence in Children's Poetry. He received the 2004 [[Poets' Prize]] for his work, ''The Lords of Misrule: Poems 1992-2002''. Kennedy accepted the [[Poetry Society of America]]'s [[Robert Frost Medal]] for lifetime service to poetry in 2009. In 2015, he received the [[Jackson Poetry Prize]], awarded by Poets & Writers.<ref>https://www.pw.org/about-us/x_j_kennedey_wins_50000_jackson_poetry_prize</ref>

Kennedy also wrote a series of children's poetry books (''Brats''), translated [[Aristophanes]]' ''[[Lysistrata]]'' into English, and edited the anthology ''Tygers of Wrath: Poems of Hate, Anger, and Invective'' (University of Georgia Press, 1981). Kennedy edited several editions of the textbook anthology ''Literature: An Introduction to Fiction, Poetry, and Drama''. With his wife Dorothy and scholar Jane E. Aaron, he is the editor of ''[[The Bedford Reader]]'', a collegiate literature textbook used for teaching to the [[AP English Language and Composition]] test.
