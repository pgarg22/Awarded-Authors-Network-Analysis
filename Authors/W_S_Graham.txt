'''William Sydney Graham''' (19 November 1918 – 9 January 1986) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] poet, who was often associated with [[Dylan Thomas]] and the [[Neo-romanticism|neo-romantic]] group of poets. Graham's poetry was mostly overlooked in his lifetime; however, partly thanks to the support of [[Harold Pinter]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.haroldpinter.org/poetry/poetry_graham.shtml |title=W.S. Graham |website=haroldpinter.org |access-date=5 April 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170416100210/http://www.haroldpinter.org/poetry/poetry_graham.shtml |archivedate=16 April 2017 }}</ref> his work was eventually acknowledged. He was represented in the second edition of the ''[[Penguin Book of Contemporary Verse]]'' (Harmondsworth, UK, 1962) and the ''[[Anthology of Twentieth-Century British and Irish Poetry]]'' (Oxford University Press, 2001).

==Early life and work==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:WSG Plaque.JPG|thumb|Plaque marking Graham's birthplace in Hope Street, Greenock]] -->
Graham was born in [[Greenock]]. In 1932, he left school to become an apprentice draughtsman and then studied structural engineering at [[Stow College]], [[Glasgow]]. He was awarded a bursary to study literature for a year at [[Newbattle Abbey College]] in 1938. Graham spent the [[World War II|war]] years working at a number of jobs in Scotland and [[Ireland]] before moving to [[Cornwall]] in 1944. His first book, ''Cage Without Grievance'' was published in 1942.

==Graham and the neo-romantics==

The 1940s were prolific years for Graham, and he published four more books during that decade. These were ''The Seven Journeys'' (1944), ''2ND Poems'' (1945), ''The Voyages of [[Alfred Wallis]]'' (1948) and ''The White Threshold'' (1949). The style of these early poems led critics to see Graham as part of the neo-romantic group that included Dylan Thomas and [[George Barker (poet)|George Barker]]. The affinities between these three poets derive from a common interest in poets like [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]], [[Arthur Rimbaud]] and [[Hart Crane]], and, in the case of Thomas and Graham, a taste for the Bohemian lifestyle of the [[London]] literary scene.

In 1947, Graham received the Atlantic Award for Literature, and lectured at [[New York University]]<ref>Book cover blurb ''Collected Poems'', 1942-1977, Faber and Faber, London 1979  {{ISBN|0571114164}}</ref> whilst spending a year on a reading touring of the United States. He moved to London to be nearer the hub of its Bohemian world. Here he came into contact with [[T. S. Eliot]], then editor of Faber and Faber, who published ''The White Threshold'', which includes varied recollections of his childhood and youth in Scotland.<ref>[[Edwin Morgan (poet)|Morgan, Edwin]] (1981), ''The Poetry of W.S. Graham'', in Bold, Christine (ed.), ''[[Cencrastus]]'' No. 5, Summer 1981, pp. 8 - 10.</ref> Faber and Faber remained Graham's publishers for the rest of his life.

==''The Nightfishing'' and legacy==

In 1954, Graham returned to Cornwall to live near the [[St Ives, Cornwall]] artists' colony. Here he became friendly with several of the resident painters, including [[Bryan Wynter]] and [[Roger Hilton]]. The following year, Faber and Faber published his  ''The Nightfishing,'' a book whose title poem marked a dramatic change in Graham's poetry. The poem moved on from his earlier style and moved away from the neo-romantic/apocalyptic tag. Unfortunately for the poet, the poem's appearance coincided with the rise of the [[Movement (literature)|Movement]] with their open hostility to the neo-romantics. Despite the support of Eliot and [[Hugh MacDiarmid]], the book was neither a critical nor a popular success.

It was to be fifteen years before Graham published another book, ''Malcolm Mooney's Land'' (1970). This, and his last book, ''Implements in Their Places'' are truly original and enduring poetic achievements, for which Graham is slowly coming to be recognised. For many years, he had lived in semi-poverty on his income as a writer, but in 1974 he received a [[Civil List Act 1837|Civil List pension]] of £500 per year. Perhaps because of this alleviation of his financial circumstances, Graham began to publish with more frequency, with ''Implements in their Places'' (1977), ''Collected Poems 1942–1977'' (1979) and an American-published ''Selected Poems'' (1980). He died in [[Madron]], [[Cornwall]] in 1986. His last collection ''Aimed at Nobody'' was published posthumously in 1993, and a book of ''Uncollected Poems'' appeared in 1990. Faber brought out a new ''Selected Poems'' in 1996. ''The Nightfisherman: Selected Letters'' was published in 1999 and ''New Collected Poems'' in 2005.

All of Graham's poems have a location, a plot and setting (or narrative) as Graham insisted "the first act of engagement of reader and poem was in reading it aloud. This tested the syntax, pace and tone of poem and reader."<ref>Schmidt , Michael ''The Great Modern Poets'' Quercus Poetry 2006  {{ISBN|9780857382467}}</ref>

Posthumous publication activity indicates Graham's reputation has grown in recent years. Some might argue this is partly due to Harold Pinter's often-expressed enthusiasm for the poet, or attribute his increasing recognition to the widespread advocacy of poets associated with the [[British Poetry Revival]]. However, Graham's work was represented in the anthology ''[[Conductors of Chaos]]'' (1996) by a selection introduced by the poet and critic [[Tony Lopez (poet)|Tony Lopez]], who also wrote a book-length study, ''The Poetry of W. S. Graham'' (1989).

==Marriage, death and recognition==

He married another poet, Agnes Kilpatrick Dunsmuir (1909–1999), known as [[Nessie Dunsmuir]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/nessie-dunsmuir-1103126.html|title=Obituary of Nessie Dunsmuir 29 June 1999|last=Snow|first=Margaret|publisher=Independent (The)|accessdate=2009-09-11|location=London|date=29 June 1999|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124070705/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/nessie-dunsmuir-1103126.html|archivedate=24 January 2012}}</ref><ref>''New Collected Poems'', page 375. She is addressed by name in stanza 6 of "To my wife at midnight", pp. 262-265</ref> He died on 9 January 1986.

Copyright in Graham's works is held by his daughter, Rosalind Mudaliar.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.faber.co.uk/rights-and-permissions |title=Rights We Don't Have |website=faber.co.uk |access-date=5 April 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180405132356/https://www.faber.co.uk/rights-and-permissions |archivedate=5 April 2018 }}</ref>

In 2006, 20 years after his death, memorial plaques were unveiled in Fore Street, [[Madron]] where he spent his final years, and at his birthplace, 1 Hope Street, [[Greenock]].

In an event to mark his centenary year, a memorial stone to Graham was unveiled in the [[Makars' Court]], Edinburgh on 14 June 2018, and Graham's daughter Rosalind Mudaliar donated his writing chair to the Scottish Poetry Library.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/ws-graham-100-centenary-news|title=W.S.
