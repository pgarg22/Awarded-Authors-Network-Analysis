'''Henry Reed''' (22 February 1914 – 8 December 1986) was a British poet, translator, radio dramatist, and journalist.

==Life and work==
Reed was born in [[Birmingham]] and educated at [[King Edward VI Aston|King Edward VI School, Aston]], followed by the [[University of Birmingham]]. At university he associated with [[W. H. Auden]], [[Louis MacNeice]] and [[Walter Allen]]. He went on to study for an MA and then worked as a teacher and journalist. He was called up to the Army in 1941, spending most of the war as a Japanese translator. Although he had studied French and Italian at university and taught himself Greek at school, Reed did not take to Japanese, perhaps because he had learned an almost entirely military vocabulary. [[Walter Allen]], in his autobiography ''As I Walked down New Grub Street,'' said Reed intended "to devote every day for the rest of his life to forgetting another word of Japanese."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Allen |first1=Walter |title=As I walked down New Grub Street: Memories of a writing life |date=1981 |publisher=Heinemann |isbn=978-0434018291}}</ref>

After the war he worked for the [[BBC]] as a radio broadcaster, translator and playwright, where his most memorable set of productions was the ''[[Hilda Tablet]]'' series in the 1950s, produced by [[Douglas Cleverdon]]. The series started with ''A Very Great Man Indeed'', which purported to be a documentary about the research for a biography of a dead poet and novelist called Richard Shewin. This drew in part on Reed's own experience of researching a biography of the novelist [[Thomas Hardy]]. However, the 'twelve-tone composeress' Hilda Tablet, a friend of Richard Shewin, became the most interesting character in the play; and in the next play, she persuades the biographer to change the subject of the biography to her – telling him "not more than twelve volumes". Dame Hilda, as she later became, was based partly on [[Ethel Smyth]] and partly on [[Elisabeth Lutyens]] (who was not pleased, and considered legal action).

Reed's most famous poetry is in ''Lessons of the War'', originally three poems which are witty parodies of British army basic training during [[World War II]], which suffered from a lack of equipment at that time.<ref name=Press>{{cite book

S. Eliot]]'s ''[[Burnt Norton]]''. Eliot himself was amused by "Chard Whitlow"'s mournful imitations of his poetic style ("As we get older we do not get any younger ...").<ref>Eliot wrote of the parody: "Most parodies of one's own work strike one as very poor. In fact one is inclined to think one could parody oneself much better ... But there is one which deserves the success it has had, Henry Reed's ''Chard Whitlow''."--[[Dwight Macdonald|Macdonald, Dwight]], ed. (1961) ''Parodies: an anthology from Chaucer to Beerbohm--and after''. London: Faber; pp. 218-19</ref>

Reed made a radio programme, reading all of ''Lessons of the War'', which was broadcast on the BBC's [[Network Three]] on 14 February 1966.<ref name="RadioTimes" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Audio of Henry Reed's "The Complete Lessons of the War"|url=http://www.solearabiantree.net/namingofparts/audio.php|accessdate=26 February 2018}}</ref>

He was often confused with the poet and critic [[Herbert Read]] (1893 – 1968); the two men were unrelated. Reed responded to this confusion by naming his 'alter ego' biographer in the ''Hilda Tablet'' plays "Herbert Reeve" and then by having everyone get the name slightly wrong.

The Papers of Henry Reed are kept in the [[University of Birmingham]] Library Special Collections.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Papers of Henry Reed|url=https://calmview.bham.ac.uk/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&id=XMS31|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2021-02-09|website=calmview.bham.ac.uk}}</ref>
