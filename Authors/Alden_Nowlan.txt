'''Alden Albert Nowlan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|oʊ|l|ə|n}}; January 25, 1933 – June 27, 1983) was a Canadian [[poet]], [[novelist]], and [[playwright]].

==History==
Alden Nowlan was born into rural poverty in [[Stanley, Nova Scotia]], adjacent to [[Mosherville, Nova Scotia|Mosherville]], and close to the small town of [[Windsor, Nova Scotia|Windsor]], [[Nova Scotia]], along a stretch of dirt road that he would later refer to as Desolation Creek. His father, Freeman Lawrence Nowlan, worked sporadically as a manual labourer.

His mother, Grace Reese, was only 14 years of age when Nowlan was born, and she soon left the family, leaving Alden and her younger daughter Harriet to the care of their paternal grandmother. The family discouraged education as a waste of time, and Nowlan left school after only four grades. At the age of 14, he went to work in the village sawmill. At the age of 16, he discovered the new library in Windsor. Often on weekends he would travel eighteen miles to the library to get books, which broadened his already keen reading.  "I wrote (as I read) in secret." Nowlan remembered. "My father would as soon have seen me wear lipstick."

==Career and later life==
At 19, Nowlan's artfully embroidered résumé landed him a job with ''Observer'', a newspaper in Hartland, New Brunswick. While working at the ''Observer'', Nowlan began writing books of poetry, the first of which was published by [[Fredericton]]'s [[Goose Lane Editions|Fiddlehead Poetry Books]].

Nowlan eventually settled permanently in [[New Brunswick]]. In 1963, he married Claudine Orser, a typesetter on his former paper, and moved to [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]] with her and her son, John, whom he adopted. He became the night editor for the Saint John [[Telegraph Journal]] and continued to write poetry. In 1966, Nowlan was diagnosed with throat cancer. After three surgeries and a subsequent radiation treatment, his health began to improve. He wrote poems about his brush with death. In 1967, he was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]], and his collection ''Bread, Wine and Salt'' was awarded the [[Governor General's Award for English language poetry or drama|Governor General's Award for Poetry]]. Soon afterward, the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton offered him the position of Writer-in-Residence. He remained in the position until his death on June 27, 1983, after collapsing at his home with severe emphysema.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://w3.stu.ca/stu/sites/nble/n/nowlan_alden.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-04-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314103247/http://w3.stu.ca/stu/sites/nble/n/nowlan_alden.html |archive-date=2014-03-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Awards and recognition==
Nowlan's most notable literary achievements include the [[Governor General's Award]] for ''Bread, Wine and Salt'' (1967) and a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]]. He was writer-in-residence at the [[University of New Brunswick]] in Fredericton from 1968 until his death in 1983.<ref name="writerinresidence">{{cite web|title=Alden Nowlan|url=https://unbhistory.lib.unb.ca/index.php/Alden_Nowlan
|date=Aug 17, 2017|website=Archives and Special Collections|publisher=University of New Brunswick}}</ref> In New Brunswick, the Alden Nowlan Award for Excellence in English-language Literary Arts is named in his honour.

Nowlan is one of Canada's most popular 20th-century poets, and his appearance in the anthology ''Staying Alive'' (2002) has helped to spread his popularity beyond Canada.

In the 1970s, Nowlan met and became close friends with theatre director [[Walter Learning]]. The two collaborated on a number of plays, including ''[[A_Gift_to_Last#Stage_Play|A Gift to Last]]'', ''Frankenstein'', ''The Dollar Woman'', and ''The Incredible Murder of Cardinal Tosca.''

Nowlan's Fredericton home is now the residence of the Graduate Student Association at the University of New Brunswick. Dubbed "Windsor Castle" by Nowlan after its location on Windsor Street, the simple building is now officially called the Alden Nowlan House.

Nowlan is buried in the Poets' Corner of the Forest Hill cemetery in Fredericton, New Brunswick.
