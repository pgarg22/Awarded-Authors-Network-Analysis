In 2012, Collins became Poetry Consultant for ''[[Smithsonian Magazine]]''  During the summer of 2013, Collins guest hosted Garrison Keillor's popular daily radio broadcast, ''The Writer's Almanac,'' on NPR.  Collins has been invited to read at The White House three times—in 2001, 2011, and 2014.   In 2014 he traveled to Russia as a cultural emissary of the U.S. State Department.

Collins, as one of the Favorite 100 TED speakers of all time, was invited to give another TED talk at [[TED (conference)|TED]] 2014 in Vancouver, Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ted.com/speakers/billy_collins|title=Billy Collins|author=Billy Collins|work=ted.com}}</ref>

As U.S. Poet Laureate, Collins read his poem ''The Names'' at a special joint session of the [[United States Congress]] on September 6, 2002, held to [[First anniversary of the September 11, 2001 Attacks|remember the victims of the 9/11 attacks]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4470122/us-poet-laureate-billy-collins-names|title=US Poet Laureate Billy Collins Names - Video - C-SPAN.org|work=C-SPAN.org}}</ref> Though, unlike their British counterparts, U.S. poets laureate are not asked or expected to write occasional poetry, Collins was asked by the [[Librarian of Congress]] to write a poem especially for that event. Collins initially refused to read "The Names" in public, though he has read it two times in public since 2002. He vowed not to include it in any of his books, refusing to capitalize on the 9/11 attacks.  However, "The Names" was included in ''The Poets Laureate Anthology'' put out by the Library of Congress, for which Collins wrote the foreword. At the time the only book-published version of "The Names", it contained a number of typographical errors. The poem also appeared in the ''New York Times'', September 6, 2002. Collins finally agreed to include "The Names" in his new and selected volume ''Aimless Love'' in 2013.  As Poet Laureate, Collins instituted the program ''Poetry 180'' for high schools. Collins chose 180 poems for the program and the accompanying book, ''Poetry 180: A Turning Back to Poetry''—one for each day of the school year. Collins edited a second anthology, ''180 More Extraordinary Poems for Every Day'' to refresh the supply of available poems. The program is online, and poems are available there for no charge.<ref>[http://www.loc.gov/poetry/180/ From the Library of Congress official website for ''Poetry 180''] accessed March 18, 2010</ref>

In 1997, Collins recorded ''The Best Cigarette'', a collection of 34 of his poems, that would become a bestseller. In 2005, the CD was re-released under a [[Creative Commons]] license, allowing free, non-commercial distribution of the recording. He also recorded two of his poems for the audio versions of [[Garrison Keillor]]'s collection ''Good Poems'' (2002). Collins has appeared on Keillor's radio show, ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'', numerous times, where he gained a portion of his large following. In 2005, Collins recorded ''Billy Collins Live: A Performance''<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/Billy-Collins-Live-Performance-Symphony/dp/0739320114 Billy Collins Live: A Performance at the Peter Norton Symphony Space]"</ref> in New York City. Collins was introduced by his friend, actor [[Bill Murray]].

Collins has been called "The most popular poet in America" by the ''New York Times.''<ref>Bruce Weber, "On Literary Bridge, Poet Hits a Roadblock," ''The New York Times'', December 1, 1999. ("With his books selling briskly and his readings packing them in, Mr. Collins is the most popular poet in America.")</ref> When he moved from the University of Pittsburgh Press to [[Random House]], the advance he received shocked the poetry world—a six-figure sum for a three-book deal, virtually unheard of in poetry.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/19/us/on-literary-bridge-poet-hits-a-roadblock.html ''New York Times'' article, December 19, 1999] accessed March 18, 2010</ref> The deal secured for Collins through his literary agent, Chris Calhoun, then of Sterling Lord Literistic, with the editor Daniel Menaker, remained the talk of the poetry world, and indeed the literary world, for quite some time.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/18/nyregion/citypeople-the-selling-of-billy-collins.html ''New York Times'' article November 18, 2001.] accessed March 18, 2010</ref>

Over the years, the U.S. magazine ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'' has awarded Collins several prizes in recognition of poems they publish. During the 1990s, Collins won five such prizes. The magazine also selected him as "Poet of the Year" in 1994. In 2005 Collins was the first annual recipient of its Mark Twain Prize for Humor in Poetry. He has received fellowships from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], the [[New York Foundation for the Arts]] and in 1993, from the [[Guggenheim Fellowship|John Simon Guggenheim Foundation]].

One of his most critically acclaimed works, "Fishing on the Susquehanna in July"<ref>[http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/16497 "Fishing on the Susquehanna in July"],</ref> has been added to the preserved works of the United States Native American literary registry as being deemed a culturally significant poem. The poem has been included on national Advance Placement exams for high school students.

In 2012, Collins appeared as himself in an episode of the [[PBS]] animated series ''[[Martha Speaks (TV series)|Martha Speaks]]''.

Collins is on the editorial board at ''[[The Alaska Quarterly Review]]''.  Most recently he contributed to the 30th anniversary edition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aqreview.org/|title=Home Page|website=Alaska Quarterly Review|access-date=September 13, 2020}}</ref><ref>[http://www.uaa.alaska.edu/aqr/back-issues/19_3and4.cfm Billy Collins, Contributor.
