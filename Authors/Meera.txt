She is a celebrated [[Bhakti movement|Bhakti]] saint, particularly in the North Indian Hindu tradition.<ref>Karen Pechelis (2004), The Graceful Guru, [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|978-0195145373}}, pages 21-23, 29-30</ref><ref>Neeti Sadarangani (2004), Bhakti Poetry in Medieval India: Its Inception, Cultural Encounter and Impact, Sarup & Sons, {{ISBN|978-8176254366}}, pages 76-80</ref>

Mirabai was born into a [[Rajput]] royal family in [[Kudki]] (modern-day [[Pali district]] of [[Rajasthan]]) and spent her childhood in [[Merta City|Merta]]. She is mentioned in ''[[Bhaktamal]]'', confirming that she was widely known and a cherished figure in the Bhakti movement culture by about 1600 CE.<ref name=asher>Catherine Asher and Cynthia Talbot (2006), India before Europe, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521809047}}, page 109</ref> 

Most legends about Mirabai mention her fearless disregard for social and family conventions, her devotion to Krishna, her treating Krishna as her husband and being persecuted by her [[in-law]]s for her religious devotion.<ref name="ushamiralife" /><ref name="asher" /> She has been the subject of numerous folk tales and [[hagiography|hagiographic]] legends, which are inconsistent or widely different in details.<ref name="ushamiralife" /><ref name="nancy">Nancy Martin-Kershaw (2014), Faces of the Feminine in Ancient, Medieval, and Modern India (Editor: Mandakranta Bose), Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195352771}}, pages 162-178</ref> 

Millions of devotional hymns in passionate praise of Krishna are attributed to Meerabai in the Indian tradition, but just a few hundred are believed to be authentic by scholars, and the earliest written records suggest that except for two hymns, most were written down only in the 18th century.<ref name="hawley">John Stratton Hawley (2002), Asceticism (Editors: Vincent Wimbush, Richard Valantasi), Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195151381}}, pages 301-302</ref> Many poems attributed to Meera were likely composed later by others who admired Meera. These hymns a type of [[bhajan]], and are popular across India.<ref>Edwin Bryant (2007), Krishna: A Sourcebook, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195148923}}, page 254</ref> 

Hindu temples, such as in Chittorgarh fort, are dedicated to Mirabai's memory.<ref name="ushamiralife" /> Legends about Mirabai's life, of contested authenticity, have been the subject of movies, comic strips and other popular literature in modern times.<ref>Edwin Bryant (2007), Krishna: A Sourcebook, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195148923}}, page 242</ref>

==Biography==
[[File:Rajasthan-Chittore Garh 09.jpg|left|230px|thumb|''Meera's'' temple to [[Krishna]] at [[Chittor Fort]], Rajasthan]]
Authentic records about Meera are not available, and scholars have attempted to establish Meera's biography from secondary literature that mentions her, and wherein dates and other moments. Meera unwillingly married [[Bhoj Raj]], the crown prince of [[Mewar]], in 1516.<ref name=usha13>Usha Nilsson (1997), Mira bai, Sahitya Akademi, {{ISBN|978-8126004119}}, pages 12-13</ref><ref>Nancy Martin-Kershaw (2014), Faces of the Feminine in Ancient, Medieval, and Modern India (Editor: Mandakranta Bose), Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195352771}}, page 165</ref> Her husband was wounded in one of the ongoing wars with the [[Delhi Sultanate]] in 1518, and he died of battle wounds in 1521. Both her father and father-in-law ([[Rana Sanga]]) died a few days after their defeat in the [[Battle of Khanwa]] against first [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Babur]].

After the death of her father-in-law Rana Sanga, Vikram Singh became the ruler of Mewar. According to a popular legend, her in-laws tried many times to assassinate her, such as sending Meera a glass of poison and telling her it was nectar or sending her a basket with a snake instead of flowers.<ref name=brit1/><ref name=usha13/> According to the hagiographic legends, she was not harmed in either case, with the snake miraculously becoming a Krishna idol (or a garland of flowers depending on the version).<ref name=nancy/><ref name=usha13/> In another version of these legends, she is asked by Vikram Singh to go drown herself, which she tries but she finds herself floating on water.<ref name=usha17>Usha Nilsson (1997), Mira bai, Sahitya Akademi, {{ISBN|978-8126004119}}, pages 16-17</ref> Yet another legend states that the third Mughal emperor [[Akbar]] came with [[Tansen]] to visit Meera and presented a pearl necklace, but scholars doubt this ever happened because Tansen joined Akbar's court in 1562, 15 years after she died.<ref name=usha17/>
Similarly, some stories state that [[Ravidas|Guru Ravidas ]] was her guru (teacher), but there is no corroborating historical evidence for this. Some versions suggest this could likely have happened. Others disagree.<ref name=usha17/>

The three different oldest records are known as of 2014 that mention Meera,<ref>These are Munhata Nainsi's Khyat from [[Jodhpur]], Prem Ambodh from [[Amritsar]] and Nabhadas's Chappy from [[Varanasi]]; see: JS Hawley and GS Mann (2014), Culture and Circulation: Literature in Motion in Early Modern India (Editors: Thomas De Bruijn and Allison Busch), Brill Academic, {{ISBN|978-9004264472}}, pages 131-135</ref> all from the 17th century and written within 150 years of Meera's death, neither mention anything about her childhood or circumstances of her marriage to Bhojraj nor do they mention that the people who persecuted her were her in-laws or from some Rajput royal family.<ref>JS Hawley and GS Mann (2014), Culture and Circulation: Literature in Motion in Early Modern India (Editors: Thomas De Bruijn and Allison Busch), Brill Academic, {{ISBN|978-9004264472}}, pages 131-135</ref> Nancy Martin-Kershaw states that to the extent Meera was challenged and persecuted, religious or social conventions were unlikely to have been the cause, rather the likely cause was political chaos and military conflicts between the Rajput kingdom and the Mughal Empire.

Other stories state that Mira Bai left the kingdom of Mewar and went on pilgrimages. In her last years, Meera lived in [[Dwarka]] or [[Vrindavan]], where legends state she miraculously disappeared by merging into an idol of Krishna in 1547.<ref name=ushamiralife/><ref name=brit1/> While miracles are contested by scholars for the lack of historical evidence, it is widely acknowledged that Meera dedicated her life to Lord Krishna, composing songs of devotion, and was one of the most important poet-saint of the Bhakti movement period.<ref name=brit1/><ref name=usha17/><ref>John S Hawley (2005), Three Bhakti Voices: Mirabai, Surdas and Kabir in Their Times and Ours, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195670851}}, pages 128-130</ref>

==Poetry==
[[File:Krishna N Radha.jpg|thumb|230px|Most of Meera's poems are dedicated to God in the form of [[Krishna]] (left), calling him the Dark One or the Mountain Lifter. Some Meera songs include [[Radha]] (right), the lover of Krishna. All her poems have philosophical connotations.<ref>Edwin Bryant (2007), Krishna: A Sourcebook, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195148923}}, page 244</ref>]]

A number of compositions by Meera Bai continue to be sung today in India, mostly as devotional songs (''bhajans'') though nearly all of them have a philosophical connotation.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Subramanian |first1=VK |title=Mystic songs of Meera (in Hindi and English) |date=1 February 2005 |publisher=Abhinav publications |isbn=8170174589 |url=https://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/mystic-songs-of-meera-with-english-transliteration-and-translation-IDF197/ |access-date=23 November 2018 |archive-date=23 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181123113608/https://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/mystic-songs-of-meera-with-english-transliteration-and-translation-IDF197/ |url-status=live }}</ref> One of her most popular compositions remains "''Paayoji maine Ram Ratan dhan paayo''" (पायो जी मैंने राम रतन धन पायो।, "I have been given the richness of Lord's name blessing").<ref>{{cite web |title=Lyrics - Ram Ratan Dhan Paayo (Lata Mangeshkar rendition) |url=http://tophindilyrics.com/shri-ram-bhajan/%e0%a4%aa%e0%a4%be%e0%a4%af%e0%a5%8b-%e0%a4%9c%e0%a5%80-%e0%a4%ae%e0%a5%88%e0%a4%82%e0%a4%a8%e0%a5%87-%e0%a4%b0%e0%a4%be%e0%a4%ae-%e0%a4%b0%e0%a4%a4%e0%a4%a8-%e0%a4%a7%e0%a4%a8-%e0%a4%aa%e0%a4%be/ |website=www.tophindilyrics.com |publisher=Top Hindi Lyrics |access-date=23 November 2018 |archive-date=9 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181209074615/http://tophindilyrics.com/shri-ram-bhajan/%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AF%E0%A5%8B-%E0%A4%9C%E0%A5%80-%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%88%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%87-%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AE-%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%A8-%E0%A4%A7%E0%A4%A8-%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%BE/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The poetry of Meera : a compendium of her songs translated in English |publisher=Poetry Hunter |url=https://www.poemhunter.com/i/ebooks/pdf/mirabai_2012_7.pdf |access-date=23 November 2018 |archive-date=23 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181123112146/https://www.poemhunter.com/i/ebooks/pdf/mirabai_2012_7.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> Meera's poems are lyrical ''padas'' (metric verses) in [[Rajasthani language]].<ref name=usha17/> While thousands of verses are attributed to her, scholars are divided in their opinion as to how many of them were actually penned by Meera herself.<ref>{{cite web |title=Meera ke bhajan (Hindi) |url=https://hindividya.com/mirabai-poems/ |website=www.hindividya.com |date=10 June 2016 |publisher=Hindi Vidya |access-date=23 November 2018 |archive-date=23 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181123113509/https://hindividya.com/mirabai-poems/ |url-status=live }}</ref> There are no surviving manuscripts of her poetry from her time and the earliest records with two poems credited to her are from early 18th-century, more than 150 years after she died.<ref name="hawley" />

The largest collection of poems credited to her are in 19th-century manuscripts. Scholars have attempted to establish authenticity based on both the poem and Meera being mentioned in other manuscripts as well as from style, linguistics and form.<ref name="hawley" /><ref name="edwinsongs">Edwin Bryant (2007), Krishna: A Sourcebook, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195148923}}, pages 244-245</ref> John Stratton Hawley cautions, "When one speaks of the poetry of Mirabai, then, there is always an element of enigma. (...) there must always remain a question about whether there is any real relation between the poems we cite and a historical Mira."<ref>John Stratton Hawley (2002), Asceticism (Editors: Vincent Wimbush, Richard Valantasi), Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195151381}}, page 302</ref>

In her poems, Krishna is a yogi and lover, and she herself is a yogini ready to take her place by his side into a spiritual marital bliss.<ref name=hawley/> Meera's style combines impassioned mood, defiance, longing, anticipation, joy and ecstasy of union, always centred on Krishna.<ref name=edwinsongs/>

{{Quote|
<poem>
My [[Krishna|Dark One]] has gone to an alien land.
He has left me behind, he's never returned, he's never sent me a single word.
So I've stripped off my ornaments, jewels and adornments, cut my hair from my head.
And put on holy garments, all on his account, seeking him in all four directions.
Mira: unless she meets the Dark One, her Lord, she doesn't even want to live.
</poem>
|Mira Bai|Translated by John Stratton Hawley<ref>John Stratton Hawley (2002), Asceticism (Editors: Vincent Wimbush, Richard Valantasi), Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195151381}}, page 303</ref>}}

Meera speaks of a personal relationship with Krishna as her lover, lord and mountain lifter. ([[Sanson Ki Mala Pe|Sanson Ki Mala Pe Simru Main Pi Ka Naam]]) is written by [[Meera Bai]] Shows her dedication towards Krishna.The characteristic of her poetry is complete surrender.

{{Quote|
<poem>
After making me fall for you so hard, where are you going?
Until the day I see you, no repose: my life, like a fish washed on shore, flails in agony.
For your sake I'll make myself a yogini, I'll hurl myself to death on the saw of Kashi.
Mira's Lord is the clever Mountain Lifter, and I am his, a slave to his lotus feet.
</poem>

Meera is often classed with the northern Sant bhaktis who spoke of Lord Sri Krishna.

Scholars acknowledge that Meera was one of the central poet-saints of the Bhakti movement which was during a difficult period in Indian history filled with religious conflicts. Yet, they simultaneously question the extent to which Meera was a canonical projection of social imagination that followed, where she became a symbol of people's suffering and a desire for an alternative.<ref name="dirkparita">Dirk Wiemann (2008), Genres of Modernity: Contemporary Indian Novels in English, Rodopi, {{ISBN|978-9042024939}}, pages 148-149</ref> Dirk Wiemann, quoting Parita Mukta, states,

{{Quote|
If one accepts that someone very akin to the Mira legend [about persecution and her devotion] existed as an actual social being, the power of her convictions broke the brutal feudal relationships that existed at that time. The Mira Bai of the popular imagination, then, is an intensely [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] figure by virtue of that anticipatory radical democracy which propels Meera out of the [[historicity]] that remains nonetheless ascribed to her. She goes beyond the shadowy realms of the past to inhabit the very core of a future which is embodied within the suffering of a people who seek an alternative.
|Dirk Wiemann / Parita Mukta| On Meera<ref name=dirkparita/><ref name=parita>Parita Mukta (1998), Upholding the Common Life: The Community of Mirabai, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195643732}}, pages viii-x, 34-35</ref>}}

The continued influence of Meera, in part, has been her message of freedom, her resolve and right to pursue her devotion to deity Krishna and her spiritual beliefs as she felt drawn to despite her persecution.<ref name="dirkparita" /><ref name="parita" /> Her appeal and influence in Indian culture, writes Edwin Bryant, is from her emerging, through her legends and poems, as a person "who stands up for what is right and suffers bitterly for holding fast to her convictions, as other men and women have", yet she does so with a language of love, with words painting the "full range of emotions that mark love, whether between human beings or between human and divine".<ref>Edwin Bryant (2007), Krishna: A Sourcebook, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195148923}}, page 245</ref>
