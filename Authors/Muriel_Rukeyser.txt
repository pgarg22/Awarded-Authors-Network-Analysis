'''Muriel Rukeyser''' (December 15, 1913 – February 12, 1980) was an American poet and political activist, best known for her poems about equality, feminism, social justice, and Judaism. [[Kenneth Rexroth]] said that she was the greatest poet of her "exact generation."<ref> Poem Hunter. "Muriel Rukeyser." https://www.poemhunter.com/muriel-rukeyser/biography/ </ref>

One of her most powerful pieces was a group of poems titled ''The Book of the Dead'' (1938), documenting the details of the [[Hawk's Nest incident]], an industrial disaster in which hundreds of miners died of [[silicosis]].

Her poem "To be a Jew in the Twentieth Century" (1944), on the theme of [[Judaism]] as a gift, was adopted by the American [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]] movements for their [[Siddur|prayer books]], something Rukeyser said "astonished" her, as she had remained distant from Judaism throughout her early life.<ref>{{cite web|title=On "To Be a Jew in the Twentieth Century"|url=http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/poets/m_r/rukeyser/tobeajew.htm|work=Modern American Poetry|publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|access-date=April 6, 2012}}</ref>

==Early life==
Muriel Rukeyser was born on December 15, 1913 to Lawrence and Myra Lyons Rukeyser.<ref>{{Cite book|title=American writers: a collection of literary biographies|last=Unger|first=Leonard|last2=Litz|first2=A. Walton|last3=Weigel|first3=Molly|last4=Bechler|first4=Lea|last5=Parini|first5=Jay|date=1974-01-01|publisher=Scribner|isbn=0684197855|location=New York|oclc = 1041142|language=en}}</ref> She attended the [[Ethical Culture Fieldston School]], a private school in [[The Bronx]], then [[Vassar College]] in [[Poughkeepsie (town), New York|Poughkeepsie]]. From 1930 to 32, she attended [[Columbia University]].

Her literary career began in 1935 when her book of poetry ''Theory of Flight'', based on flying lessons she took, was chosen by the American poet [[Stephen Vincent Benét]] for publication in the ''[[Yale Younger Poets Series]]''.

==Activism and writing==
{{quote|Rukeyser was one of the great integrators, seeing the fragmentary world of modernity not as irretrievably broken, but in need of societal and emotional repair.|Adrienne Rich|title=Essays on Art in Society|source=A Human Eye}}

Rukeyser was active in progressive politics throughout her life. At age 21, she covered the [[Scottsboro case]] in Alabama, then worked for the [[International Labor Defense]], which handled the defendants' appeals. She wrote for the ''[[Daily Worker]]'' and a variety of publications, including ''Decision'' and ''Life & Letters Today'', for which she covered the [[People's Olympiad]] (Olimpiada Popular, Barcelona), the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] government's alternative to the Nazis' [[1936 Berlin Olympics]]. While she was in Spain, the [[Spanish Civil War]] broke out, the basis of her book ''Mediterranean''. Most famously, she traveled to [[Gauley Bridge]], [[West Virginia]], to investigate the recurring [[silicosis]] among miners there, which resulted in her poem sequence ''The Book of the Dead''. During and after [[World War II]], she gave a number of striking public lectures, published in her ''The Life of Poetry'' ([http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/poets/m_r/rukeyser/life.htm excerpts here]). For much of her life, she taught university classes and led workshops, but she never became a career academic.

In 1996, Paris Press reissued ''The Life of Poetry'', which was published in 1949 but had fallen out of print. In a publisher's note, Jan Freeman called it a book that "ranks among the most essential works of twentieth century literature." In it Rukeyser makes the case that poetry is essential to democracy, essential to human life and understanding.

In the 1960s and 1970s, when Rukeyser presided over [[International PEN|PEN]]'s American center, her feminism and opposition to the [[Vietnam War]] drew a new generation to her poetry. The title poem of her last book, ''The Gates'', is based on her unsuccessful attempt to visit Korean poet [[Kim Chi-Ha]] on death row in [[South Korea]]. In 1968, she signed the "[[Writers and Editors War Tax Protest]]" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.<ref>"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest" January 30, 1968 ''New York Post''</ref>

In addition to her poetry, she wrote a fictionalized memoir, ''The Orgy'', plays and screenplays, and translated work by [[Octavio Paz]] and [[Gunnar Ekelöf]]. She also wrote biographies of [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]], [[Wendell Willkie]], and [[Thomas Hariot]]. [[Andrea Dworkin]] worked as her secretary in the early 1970s. Also in the 1970s she served on the Advisory Board of the [[Westbeth Playwrights Feminist Collective]], a New York City based theatre group that wrote and produced plays on feminist issues.

Rukeyser died in New York on February 12, 1980, from a stroke, with [[diabetes]] as a contributing factor. She was 66.

==In other media==
In the television show ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'', Metatron the angel quotes an excerpt of Rukeyser's poem "Speed of Darkness": "The Universe is made of stories, not of atoms."

[[File:Library Walk 6.JPG|thumb|Speed of Darkness]]
[[Jeanette Winterson]]'s novel ''Gut Symmetries'' (1997) quotes Rukeyser's poem "King's Mountain".

Rukeyser's translation of a poem by Octavio Paz was adapted by [[Eric Whitacre]] for his choral composition "[[Water Night (Whitacre)|Water Night]]."  [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]] set one of her texts in his opera ''[[Doctor Atomic]]'', and [[Libby Larsen]] set the poem "Looking at Each Other" in her choral work ''Love Songs''. “Recovering,” for soprano and piano, is a setting by [[Chester Biscardi]] of two lines from her “The Poem as Mask: Orpheus” and the entirety of “Recovering”.

Writer Marian Evans and composer Chris White are collaborating on a play about Rukeyser, ''Throat of These Hours'', titled after a line in Rukeyser's ''Speed of Darkness''.

She also served as the principal writer for the [[Lee R. Bobker]]-directed film [[All the Way Home - 1957]], a story about a white family who has just put their house on the market and are soon showing it to an interested black family; neighbors begin to gossip and soon the white family becomes the target of harassment and threats by bigoted residents in the community, who do not want a black family in the neighborhood.<ref> imdb.

The ''[[Journal of Narrative Theory|JDT: Journal of Narrative Theory]], a publication from Eastern Michigan University,'' dedicated a special issue to Rukeyser in Fall 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://murielrukeyser.emuenglish.org/welcome/jnt-journal-of-narrative-theory-43-3-contents/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140117023512/http://murielrukeyser.emuenglish.org/welcome/jnt-journal-of-narrative-theory-43-3-contents/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=17 January 2014 |title=Muriel Rukeyser: A Living Archive |date=4 December 2013 |publisher=[[Eastern Michigan University]] |access-date=16 January 2014 }}</ref>

Rukeyser's 5-poem sequence "Käthe Kollwitz" (The Speed of Darkness, 1968, Random House)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://murielrukeyser.emuenglish.org/writing/kathe-kollwitz/ |title=Käthe Kollwitz |website=murielrukeyser.emuenglish.org |access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref> was set by Tom Myron in his composition "Käthe Kollwitz for Soprano and String Quartet," "written in response to a commission from violist Julia Adams for a work celebrating the 30th anniversary of the Portland String Quartet in 1998."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dramonline.org/albums/darkness-light-vol-3/notes |title=Darkness & Light, Vol. 3 |website=dramonline.org |access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref>

Rukeyser's poem "Gunday's Child" was set to music by the experimental rock band [[Sleepytime Gorilla Museum]].

==Personal life==
Rukeyser married painter Glynn Collins in 1945. The marriage only lasted six weeks; Rukeyser had the marriage annulled 12 weeks later. <ref> Reveries Under the Sign of Austen, Two . "Foremother Poet: Muriel Rukeyser (1913-1980)." Author: Ellen and Jim. August 25, 2012. https://reveriesunderthesignofausten.wordpress.com/2012/08/25/foremother-poet-muriel-rukeyser-1913-1980/ </ref> 

On September 25, 1947, Rukeyser gave birth to son William Laurie Rukeyser (initially named Laurie) as a single woman; she never publicly revealed the father of her son. <ref> Jewish Women Archive. MURIELRUKEYSER - 1913 – 1980. Michael J. Schwartz  </ref><ref> Reveries Under the Sign of Austen, Two . "Foremother Poet: Muriel Rukeyser (1913-1980)." Author: Ellen and Jim. August 25, 2012.</ref>  

According to her granddaughter, Rebecca Rukeyser, Muriel Rukeyser conceived her son "with <Donnan Jeffers (1916-1982)> the very dashing, very alcoholic son of poet Robinson Jeffers" (1887-1962).

She was bisexual.<ref>https://jewishcurrents.org/muriels-gift/ Muriel’s Gift
