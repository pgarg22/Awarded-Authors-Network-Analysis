==Early life==
{{quote box
| quote = "...&nbsp;It taught me&nbsp;... about the discipline about performance&nbsp;... Every morning she had a duck party, she would wake up very early and tune her guitar and warm up her voice, and it taught me that you could take performance seriously. I think a lot of actors have trouble taking things seriously,&nbsp;... but it's really like anything else in the world&nbsp;... So it gave me the confidence to take it seriously and not make me feel silly for indulging in a role."
