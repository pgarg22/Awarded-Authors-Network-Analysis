==Biography==

===Personal life===
Jane was the last of the four children of Charles Elgee (1783–1824), the son of Archdeacon [[John Elgee]], a [[Wexford]] solicitor, and his wife Sarah (née Kingsbury, d. 1851). Her father died when she was three years old which meant she was largely self-educated. Even so she is said to have mastered 10 languages by the age of 18. Her great-grandfather was an Italian who had come to Wexford in the 18th century.<ref>Hesketh Pearson, ''The Life of Oscar Wilde'', reprinted by Penguin Books, 1985. p. 18.</ref>

On 12 November 1851 she married [[William Wilde|Sir William Wilde]], an eye and ear surgeon (and also a researcher of folklore), in St. Peter's church in Dublin,<ref>[https://churchrecords.irishgenealogy.ie/churchrecords/details/b293f70572815?b=https%3A%2F%2Fchurchrecords.irishgenealogy.ie%2Fchurchrecords%2Fsearch.jsp%3Fnamefm%3D%26namel%3Delgee%26location%3D%26yyfrom%3D%26yyto%3D%26submit%3DSearch] The church no longer exists.</ref> and they had three children: [[Willie Wilde|William Charles Kingsbury Wilde]] (26 September 1852 – 13 March 1899), [[Oscar Wilde|Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde]] (16 October 1854 – 30 November 1900), and Isola Francesca Emily Wilde (2 April 1857 – 23 February 1867). Her eldest son William Wilde became a journalist and poet, her younger son Oscar Wilde became a prolific and famous writer, and her daughter Isola Wilde died in childhood of a fever. Jane was the grandmother of Oscar's sons [[Cyril Holland|Cyril]] and [[Vyvyan Holland]], and of Willie's daughter [[Dorothy Wilde]].

When her husband died in 1876, the family discovered that he was virtually bankrupt.<ref>Terence de Vere White, ''The Parents of Oscar Wilde'', Hodder & Stoughton, 1967.</ref> Jane Wilde - now Lady Wilde, following the knighting of her husband in 1864 - joined her sons, Willie and Oscar, in London in 1879, where she was making a name for himself in literary circles. She lived with her older son in poverty, supplementing their meagre income by writing for fashionable magazines and producing books based on the research of her late husband into Irish [[folklore]]. She wrote several books including 'Ancient legends, mystic charms, and superstitions of Ireland' (1887). Her poems are said to have influenced her son Oscar's own work. For example, his 'Ballad of Reading Gaol' has been compared to her poem 'The Brothers' (based on a true story of a trial and execution in the 1798 Rebellion).<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/like-mother-like-son-1.26539 | title=Like Mother, Like Son |work=The Irish Times}}</ref>

In January 1896 Lady Wilde contracted [[bronchitis]] and, dying, asked for permission to see Oscar, who was imprisoned in [[Reading Gaol]]. Her request was refused. It was claimed that her "[[Fetch (folklore)|fetch]]" (i.e. her apparition) appeared in Oscar's prison cell as she died at her home, 146 [[Oakley Street, Chelsea|Oakley Street]], Chelsea, on 3 February 1896. Her funeral was held on 5 February at [[Kensal Green Cemetery]] in London. It was paid for by Oscar, as her older son, Willie Wilde, was penniless.<ref>[http://www.tandem-uk.com/exile.htm Cemetery]</ref> She was buried anonymously in common ground without a headstone. In 1996 she was memoralised in the form of a plaque on the grave of Sir William Wilde in Dublin as 'Speranza of The Nation, writer, translator, poet and nationalist, author of works on Irish folklore, early advocate of equality for women, and founder of a leading literary salon'.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/like-mother-like-son-1.26539 | title=Like Mother, Like Son |work=The Irish Times}}</ref> In 1999, a monument to her, in the form of a Celtic cross, was erected at Kensal Green Cemetery by the Oscar Wilde Society. (It is located at grid square 147 – Cambridge Avenue South (near Canalside), set back 20 metres from the curved path – opposite SQ.148.)

Lady Wilde was the niece of [[Charles Maturin]] and wrote for the [[Young Ireland]] movement of the 1840s, publishing poems in ''[[The Nation (Irish newspaper)|The Nation]]'' under the pseudonym of ''Speranza''. Her works included pro-Irish independence and anti-British writing; she was sometimes known as "Speranza of the Nation".  [[Charles Gavan Duffy]] was the editor when "Speranza" wrote commentary calling for armed revolution in Ireland. The authorities at [[Dublin Castle]] shut down the paper and brought Charles Duffy to court but he refused to name the person who had written the offending article. "Speranza" reputedly stood up in court and claimed responsibility for the article. While the confession was ignored by the authorities, they permanently shut the newspaper down.<ref>Joy Melville, "Wilde , Jane Francesca Agnes, Lady Wilde (1821–1896)," ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Oxford University Press, 2004.</ref>

Jane was an early advocate of women's rights, and campaigned for better education for women. She invited the [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|suffragist]] [[Millicent Fawcett]] to her home to speak on female liberty. She praised the passing of the Married Women's Property Act of 1883, which prevented a woman from having to enter marriage 'as a bond slave, disenfranchised of all rights over her fortune'.<ref>Lady Wilde, "A New Era in English and Irish Social Life," ''The Gentlewoman'', January 1883.</ref>

In 1864 Sir William and Lady Wilde were at the centre of a sensational Dublin court case regarding a young woman called Mary Travers, the daughter of a colleague of Sir William's and a long time patient. Travers claimed that Sir William had drugged her with [[chloroform]] and raped her in 1862; when Lady Wilde wrote a letter to Travers's father contesting the allegations, Mary sued her for libel.<ref>{{cite book| title=Oscar Wilde| author=Richard Ellmann| publisher=Vintage Books| year=1988| pages=14–15}}</ref> Mary Travers won the case, although she was only awarded a farthing for damages plus costs. The costs, however, amounted to £2,000.<ref>Gerard Hanberry, <em>More Lives Than One: The Remarkable Family of Oscar Wilde through the Generations</em>, Collins Press, 2011, {{ISBN|9781848899438}}</ref>
