'''Mir Babar Ali Anees''' ({{lang-ur|مير ببر على انيس}}) (1803–1874), also known as '''Mir Anees''' was an [[Urdu poet]]. He used his [[pen-name]] (takhallus) of Anees ([[Urdu]]: {{Nastaliq |انيس}}, ''Anees'' means "close friend, companion") in poetry. Anees used [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Urdu]], [[Arabic]], and [[Sanskrit]] words in his poetry.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archives.dailytimes.com.pk/karachi/21-Nov-2011/t2f-moot-eulogises-poetry-of-mir-anis |title=T2F moot eulogises poetry of Mir Anis|work=Daily Times|author=Asad Farooq|date=21 November 2011|accessdate=17 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725111609/http://archives.dailytimes.com.pk/karachi/21-Nov-2011/t2f-moot-eulogises-poetry-of-mir-anis |archivedate=25 July 2014  }}</ref> Anis wrote prolonged [[Marsia]]s, which was a custom of his times, but nowadays only selected sections are narrated even in [[religious]] [[ceremonies]].

Anis's mother appears to have been his greatest  inspiration.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thelucknowtribune.org/news.php?cat=873|title=A poet worth Remembering!|date=8 July 2013|work=The Lucknow Tribune|access-date=26 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726093141/http://www.thelucknowtribune.org/news.php?cat=873|archive-date=26 July 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> He gained a traditional [[Shia]] education.<ref name= drtaqiabedi/>  However, research by Nayyar Masood reveals that, while in Faizabad, Anis studied with two religious [[scholars]]; one was a [[Shia]] Scholar, Mir Najaf and the other was a Hanafi ([[Sunni]]) Scholar, Haider Ali Faizabadi. Masood also notes that Anis was well versed in [[Persian language|Persian]] as well as in [[Arabic]]. Anis also had [[military]] [[training]] and gained a thorough knowledge of old and new [[weapons]].<ref name="dawn.com">[https://www.dawn.com/news/625039 The life and works of Mir Anis]. ''The Dawn''. 30 April 2011</ref>

==Life==
Anis was invited to Lucknow where he reached the zenith of his reputation. He stayed in Lucknow because be believed that his art was not appreciated elsewhere. Yet, after the annexation of Oudh by the British, he was persuaded to visit [[Azimabad]] ([[Patna]]), [[Dulhipur]] ([[Varanasi]]), [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] and [[Allahabad]].<ref name="RBS">"A History of Urdu Literature" by Ram Babu Saxena, Allahabad, 1927</ref>

In 1870 Nawab Tahwar Jung invited Anis to Hyderabad where he declined to be presented at the court of [[Mir Mahboob Ali Khan]],<ref name="Pulpit of Tears"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salmanbookcentre.com/?section=AshoorKhanas&ak=Hussainia+Nawab+Inayath+Jung|title=Salman Book Centre – Hyderabad, India – Marsias, Majalis, Nauhay, Ashoor, Khanas, Azadari, Duas, Munajath, Qasiday, Books|website=www.salmanbookcentre.com}}</ref><ref name="Legacy of the Nizam's">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q9BXUKfSu2UC&q=Anis&pg=PA282 | title=Legacy of the Nizam's | publisher=Vani Prakashan | year=2002 | accessdate=18 June 2013 | author=Lallana Rāya | pages=282| isbn=9788170551645 }}</ref> the then [[Nizam of Hyderabad|Nizam of Hyderabad State]]. The Nizam himself went to the Majlis where the poet was to recite.  While returning from Hyderabad, he sojourned at Allahabad in 1871 and recited his marsia in the Imambara of late Lala Beni Prasad Srivastava, Vakil, who was a devotee of Imam Husain.<ref name="RBS"/>

==Work and contribution==
According to Muhammad Hussain Azad, "The late Mīr Sahib must certainly have composed at least ten thousand elegies, and salāms beyond count. He composed as easily and casually as he spoke.".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dsal.uchicago.edu/digbooks/digpager.html?BOOKID=PK2167.A84&object=521|title=Ab-e hayat, page 519 – Digital South Asia Library|website=dsal.uchicago.edu}}</ref><ref>Aab-e-Hayat (English Translation), Translated and edited by Frances W.

In his essay "How to read Iqbal?" Shamsur Rahman Faruqi wrote: "[[Muhammad Iqbal|Iqbal]] was placed better because he had, among others, [[Abdul-Qādir Bedil|Bedil]] (1644–1720) in Persian and Mir Anis (1802–1874) in [[Urdu]]." He further asserts: "The mention of Mir Anis may surprise some of us until we realize it that Mir Anis’s [[Marsiya]]s are the best premodern model in Urdu of narrative-historical, narrative-lyrical, and oral-dramatic poetry, and Iqbal’s [[poetry]] extends and exploits the possibilities created by Anis."<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZHe5MgAACAAJ&dq How to Read Iqbal?

Mir Anis was criticized for playing on religious sentiments giving his work a vertical appeal at the expense of poetic beauty.<ref>{{cite book |last=Tauhid |first=Qamar |date=20 July 1972|chapter=Mir Anis Mere Ta'assub Ke Aaine Me |title= Mir Anis|trans-chapter=Mir Anis in the Mirror of My Prejudice|trans-title= Mir Anis |language= Urdu |location= Patna, India |publisher=Ghalib Club |page= 108}}</ref> While Farhat Nadir Rizvi, in her research, has propounded that Anis was narrating recorded history and was therefore restricted in use of pure imagination and fantasy, yet he dexterously harnessed the art of [[storytelling]] in his work and we cannot but accept that he was not only a Marsiya writer but also a successful storyteller.<ref>{{cite book |author=Farhat Nadir Rizvi|date= 2 November 2017|title= Mir Anis Aur Qissa Goi Ka Fan|trans-title=Mir Anis and the Art of Story Telling|language= Urdu  |location=Lucknow, India  |publisher= Lucknow Educational And Development Trust|isbn= 9781977566805|page=468}}</ref> Anis has been compared with [[Shakespeare]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://urdushahkar.org/mir-anis-william-shakespeare-comparison-intro/|title= mir anis-William Shakespeare Comparison – Intro |website=urdu shahkar |access-date= 23 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.hikmaah.com/mydiary.asp?menuid=2&pageid=13|title= ANIS AND SHAKESPEARE – A COMPARISON by Syed Ghulam Imam(publication 1950)|access-date= 23 December 2017}}</ref> Shakespeare creates imaginary plots and characters so beautifully that they appear real to the reader; Anis narrates events and characters fossilized in history so vividly that they become alive in the eyes of his audience.<ref>{{cite book |author=Shabbir Hasan Rezvi |date=20 July 1972|chapter=Mir Anis Ka Shaoor-e-Tanasub |title= Mir Anis|trans-chapter=Mir Anis' Sense of Proportions|trans-title= Mir Anis |language= Urdu |location= Patna, India |publisher=Ghalib Club |page= 75}}</ref>

Anis is also known as a pioneer in [[Ruba'i|Rubai]], an Urdu poetry branch, and enjoys status akin to that of [[Mirza Sauda]], [[Khwaja Mir Dard]] and [[Dabeer]].<ref>Extracted from: Rubai Aik Qadeem Sanaf-e-Sukhan (in Urdu Language) research of Dr. Younus Hassani, published in Midweek Magazine issued by the [[Daily Jang]], Karachi in its issue of 9 July 2014</ref> 
Besides being a master of the Marsia, Anis was also a specialist of the Rubai, the shortest complete poem in Urdu, containing only four lines. He enriched the contents of the Rubai, making it much more colorful and multi-dimensional. Anis introduced the tragic events of [[Karbala]] and their moralistic effect to Rubai. Thus, he widened the scope of Rubai to unfathomable limits. The inclusion of Karbala resulted in the florescence of the Urdu Rubai. Thus, many internal and external aspects of our life found their echo in the Urdu Rubai.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.urdushayari.in/2012/01/meer-babar-ali-anees.html|title=MEER BABAR ALI ANEES|website=urdushayari.in|date=January 2012}}</ref>
