'''Julia Alvarez''' (born March 27, 1950) is a [[Dominican-American]] [[New Formalism|New Formalist]] poet, novelist, and essayist.  She rose to prominence with the novels ''[[How the García Girls Lost Their Accents]]'' (1991), ''[[In the Time of the Butterflies]]'' (1994), and ''Yo!'' (1997). Her publications as a poet include ''Homecoming'' (1984) and ''The Woman I Kept to Myself'' (2004), and as an essayist the autobiographical compilation ''Something to Declare'' (1998). Many literary critics regard her to be one of the most significant Latina writers and she has achieved critical and commercial success on an international scale.

Julia Alvarez has also written several books for younger readers. Her first picture book for children was "The Secret Footprints" published in 2002. Alvarez has gone on to write several other books for young readers, including the "Tía Lola" book series.<ref>SiennaMoonfire.com, Sienna Moonfire Designs: “BOOKS: FOR YOUNG READERS OF ALL AGES.” Books for Young Readers of All Ages by Julia Alvarez, www.juliaalvarez.com/young-readers/#footprints.</ref>

Born in [[New York City|New York]], she spent the first ten years of her childhood in the [[Dominican Republic]], until her father's involvement in a political rebellion forced her family to flee the country. Many of Alvarez's works are influenced by her experiences as a [[Dominican-American]], and focus heavily on issues of immigration, assimilation, and identity. She is known for works that examine cultural expectations of women both in the Dominican Republic and the United States, and for rigorous investigations of cultural stereotypes. In recent years, Alvarez has expanded her subject matter with works such as '''In the Name of Salomé'' (2000)', a novel with Cuban rather than solely Dominican characters and fictionalized versions of historical figures.

In addition to her successful writing career, Alvarez is the current [[Artist-in-residence|writer-in-residence]] at [[Middlebury College]].

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Julia Alvarez was born in 1950 in [[New York City]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.biography.com/people/julia-alvarez-185850 |title=Julia Alvarez |website=Biography.com |access-date=2019-03-17 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> When she was three months old, her family moved back to the [[Dominican Republic]], where they lived for the next ten years.<ref name="dalleo135">{{harvnb|Dalleo|Machado Sáez|2007|p= 135}}</ref> She attended the [[Carol Morgan School]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Alvarez|first=Julia|date=1987|title=An American Childhood in the Dominican Republic|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41211381|journal=The American Scholar|volume=56|issue=1|pages=71-85|access-date=2021-06-28}}</ref> She grew up with her extended family in sufficient comfort to enjoy the services of maids.<ref>{{harvnb|Alvarez|1998|p= 116}}</ref> Critic Silvio Sirias believes that Dominicans value a talent for story-telling; Alvarez developed this talent early and was "often called upon to entertain guests".<ref>{{harvnb|Sirias|2001|p= 1}}</ref> In 1960, the family was forced to flee to the United States after her father participated in a failed plot to overthrow the island's military dictator, [[Rafael Trujillo]],<ref>{{harvnb|Day|2003|p= 33}}</ref> circumstances which would later be revisited in her writing: her novel ''[[How the García Girls Lost Their Accents]]'', for example, portrays a family that is forced to leave the Dominican Republic in similar circumstances,<ref>{{harvnb|Dalleo|Machado Sáez|2007|p= 4}}</ref> and in her poem, "Exile", she describes "the night we fled the country" and calls the experience a "loss much larger than I understood".<ref name="day40">{{harvnb|Day|2003|p= 40}}</ref>

Alvarez's transition from the Dominican Republic to the United States was difficult; Sirias comments that she "lost almost everything: a homeland, a language, family connections, a way of understanding, and a warmth".<ref name="sirias2">{{harvnb|Sirias|2001|p= 2}}</ref> She experienced alienation, homesickness, and prejudice in her new surroundings.<ref name="day40" /> In ''How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents'', a character asserts that trying to raise "consciousness [in the Dominican Republic]... would be like trying for cathedral ceilings in a tunnel".<ref>{{harvnb|Alvarez|2005|p= 121}}</ref>

As one of the few Latin American students in her [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] school, Alvarez faced discrimination because of her heritage.<ref name="AboutMe">{{cite web |url=http://juliaalvarez.com/about/ |title=About Me:Julia Alvarez |author=Julia Alvarez |access-date=25 October 2011 }}</ref> This caused her to turn inward and led to her fascination with literature, which she called "a portable homeland".<ref name="sirias2" /> She was encouraged by many of her teachers to pursue writing, and from a young age, was certain that this was what she wanted to do with her life.<ref name="day40" /> At the age of 13, her parents sent her to [[Abbot Academy]], a boarding school, because the local schools were not considered sufficient.<ref name="sirias3">{{harvnb|Sirias|2001|p= 3}}</ref> As a result, her relationship with her parents suffered, and was further strained when every summer she returned to the Dominican Republic to "reinforce their identities not only as Dominicans but also as proper young lady".<ref>{{harvnb|Johnson|2005|p= 18}}</ref> These intermittent exchanges between countries informed her cultural understanding, the basis of many of her works.<ref name="sirias3"/>

After graduating from Abbot Academy in 1967, she attended [[Connecticut College]] from 1967 to 1969 (where she won the Benjamin T. Marshall Poetry Prize) and then transferred to [[Middlebury College]], where she obtained her Bachelor of Arts degree, ''[[summa cum laude]]'' and [[Phi Beta Kappa Society|Phi Beta Kappa]]  (1971). She then received a master's degree from [[Syracuse University]] (1975).<ref name="sirias3" />

===Career===
After acquiring a [[master's degree]] in 1975, Alvarez took a position as a writer-in-residence for the Kentucky Arts Commission. She traveled throughout the state visiting elementary schools, high schools, colleges and communities, conducting writing workshops and giving readings. She attributes these years with providing her a deeper understanding of America and helping her realize her passion for teaching. After her work in Kentucky, she extended her educational endeavors to California, Delaware, North Carolina, Massachusetts, Washington D.C, and Illinois.<ref name="sirias4">{{harvnb|Sirias|2001|p= 4}}</ref>

Alvarez was a Visiting Assistant Professor of English for the [[University of Vermont]], in [[Burlington, VT]] for a two-year appointment in creative writing, 1981–83. She taught fiction and poetry workshops, introductory and advanced (for upperclassmen and graduate students) as well as a course on fiction (lecture format, 45 students).<ref>[http://www.juliaalvarez.com/about/vita.php] Julia Alverez Vita</ref>

In addition to writing, Alvarez holds the position of writer-in-residence at Middlebury College, where she teaches creative writing on a part-time basis.<ref name="sirias4" /> Alvarez currently resides in the [[Champlain Valley]] in [[Vermont]]. She has served as a panelist, consultant, and editor, as a judge for literary awards such as the [[PEN/Newman's Own First Amendment Award]] and the [[Casa de las Américas Prize]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.juliaalvarez.com/about/vita.php | title=Vita | publisher=juliaalvarez.com | access-date=20 September 2014}}</ref> and also gives readings and lectures across the country.<ref name="Day 2003 p= 41">{{harvnb|Day|2003|p= 41}}</ref> She and her partner, Bill Eichner, an ophthalmologist, created Alta Gracia, a farm-literacy center dedicated to the promotion of [[environmental sustainability]] and literacy and education worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cafealtagracia.com |title=Café Alta Gracia – Organic Coffee from the Dominican Republic |publisher=Cafealtagracia.com |access-date=2008-10-13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021220452/http://www.cafealtagracia.com/ |archive-date=2008-10-21 }}</ref><ref name="Sirias 2001 p= 5">{{harvnb|Sirias|2001|p= 5}}</ref> Alvarez and her husband purchased the farm in 1996 with the intent to promote cooperative and independent coffee-farming in the Dominican Republic.<ref>{{harvnb|Coonrod Martínez|2007|p= 9}}</ref> Alvarez is part of Border of Lights, an activist group that encourages positive relations between Haiti and the Dominican Republic.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.aarp.org/entertainment/celebrities/info-2018/julia-alvarez-hispanic-heritage-month.html?intcmp=AE-ENT-CEL-EOA1|title=Author Julia Alvarez on Having Dual Citizenship|work=AARP|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en}}</ref>

==Literary writing==
[[File:Library Walk 34.JPG|thumb|"Who touches this poem touches a woman"]]
Alvarez is regarded as one of the most critically and commercially successful Latina writers of her time.<ref name="Dalleo 2007 131">{{harvnb|Dalleo|Machado Sáez|2007|p= 131}}</ref> Her published works include five novels, a book of essays, three collections of poetry, four children's books, and two works of adolescent fiction.<ref>{{harvnb|Dalleo|Machado Sáez|2007|p= 133}}</ref>

Among her first published works were collections of poetry; ''The Homecoming'', published in 1984, was expanded and republished in 1996.<ref name=T5/> Poetry was Alvarez's first form of creative writing and she explains that her love for poetry has to do with the fact that "a poem is very intimate, heart-to-heart".<ref>{{harvnb|Kevane|2001|p= 23}}</ref> Her poetry celebrates nature and the detailed rituals of daily life, including domestic chores. Her poems portray stories of family life and are often told from the perspective of women. She questions patriarchal privilege and examines issues of exile, assimilation, identity, and the struggle of the lower class in an introspective manner. She found inspiration for her work from a small painting from 1894 by Pierre Bonnard called ''The Circus Rider''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/01/04/132631223/celebrating-the-phillips-collections-90th-birthday |title=Celebrating The Phillips Collection's 90th Birthday |publisher=NPR |date=2010-01-04 |access-date=2010-01-04}}</ref> Her poems, critic Elizabeth Coonrod Martínez suggests, give voice to the immigrant struggle.<ref>{{harvnb|Coonrod Martínez|2007|p= 11}}</ref>

''[[How the García Girls Lost Their Accents]]'', Alvarez's first novel, was published in 1991, and was soon widely acclaimed. It is the first major novel written in English by a Dominican author.<ref name="augenbraum114">{{harvnb|Augenbraum|Olmos|2000|p= 114}}</ref> A largely personal novel, the book details themes of cultural hybridization and the struggles of a post-colonial Dominican Republic.<ref name="dalleo137">{{harvnb|Dalleo|Machado Sáez|2007|p= 137}}</ref><ref name="frey">{{harvnb|Frey|2006}}</ref> Alvarez illuminates the integration of the Latina immigrant into the U.S. mainstream and shows that identity can be deeply affected by gender, ethnic, and class differences.<ref name="mccracken80">{{harvnb|McCracken|1999|p=80}}</ref> She uses her own experiences to illustrate deep cultural contrasts between the Caribbean and the United States.<ref>{{harvnb|McCracken|1999|p=139}}</ref> So personal was the material in the novel, that for months after it was published, her mother refused to speak with her; her sisters were also not pleased with the book.<ref name="Sirias 2001 p= 5"/> The book has sold over 250,000 copies, and was cited as an [[American Library Association Notable Book]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Sirias|2001|p= 17}}</ref>

Released in 1994, her second novel, ''[[In the Time of the Butterflies]]'', has a historical premise and elaborates on the death of the [[Mirabal sisters]] during the time of the Trujillo dictatorship in the Dominican Republic. In 1960, their bodies were found at the bottom of a cliff on the north coast of the island, and it is said they were a part of a revolutionary movement to overthrow the oppressive regime of the country at the time. These legendary figures are referred to as ''Las Mariposas'', or ''The Butterflies''.<ref name="day45">{{harvnb|Day|2003|p= 45}}</ref> This story portrays women as strong characters who have the power to alter the course of history, demonstrating Alvarez's affinity for strong female protagonists and anti-colonial movements.<ref>{{harvnb|Dalleo|Machado Sáez|2007|p= 144}}</ref> As Alvarez has explained:

: "I hope that through this fictionalized story I will bring acquaintance of these famous sisters to English speaking readers. November 25, the day of their murders is observed in many Latin American countries as the International Day Against Violence Toward Women. Obviously, these sisters, who fought one tyrant, have served as models for women fighting against injustices of all kinds."<ref name="day45" />

In 1997, Alvarez published ''Yo!'', a sequel to ''How the García Girls Lost Their Accents'', which focuses solely on the character of Yolanda.<ref name="dalleo142">{{harvnb|Dalleo|Machado Sáez|2007|p= 142}}</ref> Drawing from her own experiences, Alvarez portrays the success of a writer who uses her family as the inspiration for her work.<ref name="dalleo142" /> ''Yo!'' could be considered Alvarez's musings and criticism of her own literary success.<ref name="dalleo143">{{harvnb|Dalleo|Machado Sáez|2007|p= 143}}</ref> Alvarez's opinions on the hybridization of culture are often conveyed through the use of Spanish-English malapropisms, or ''[[Spanglish]]''; such expressions are especially prominent in ''How the García Girls Lost Their Accents''. Alvarez describes the language of the character of Laura as "a mishmash of mixed-up idioms and sayings".<ref>{{harvnb|Kafka|2000|p= 96}}</ref>

In 2001, Julia Alvarez published her first children's picture book, “The Secret Footprints”. This book was written by Alvarez, and illustrated by Fabian Negrin. The book was about the Ciguapas, which are part of a Dominican legend. The Ciguapas are a fictional people that have dark skin, black eyes, with long, shiny hair that flows down the length their bodies. They have backward feet, so that when they walk their footprints point backward. The main character is named Guapa, and she is described as being bold, and has a fascination with humans to the point that it threatens the secrecy of the Ciguapas. The book features themes such as community, curiosity, difference, gender roles, and folklore.

''In the Name of Salomé'' (2000) is a historical novel based on the lives of [[Salomé Ureña]] and of [[Camila Henríquez Ureña]], both Dominican writers and respectively mother and daughter, to illustrate how they devoted their lives to political causes. The novel takes place in several locations, including the Dominican Republic before a backdrop of political turbulence, Communist Cuba in the 1960s, and several university campuses across the United States, containing themes of empowerment and activism. As the protagonists of this novel are both women, Alvarez illustrates how these women, "came together in their mutual love of [their homeland] and in their faith in the ability of women to forge a conscience for Out Americas."<ref name="day44">{{harvnb|Day|2003|p= 44}}</ref> This book has been widely acclaimed for its careful historical research and captivating story, and was described by ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' as "one of the most politically moving novels of the past half century."<ref name="day44" />

==Influence on Latin American literature==
Alvarez is regarded as one of the most critically and commercially successful Latina writers of her time.<ref name="Dalleo 2007 131"/> As Elizabeth Coonrod Martínez observes, Alvarez is part of a movement of Latina writers that also includes [[Sandra Cisneros]] and [[Cristina García (journalist)|Cristina García]], all of whom weave together themes of the experience of straddling the borders and cultures of Latin America and the United States.<ref name="coonrod8">{{harvnb|Coonrod Martínez|2007|p= 8}}</ref> Coonrod Martínez suggests that a subsequent generation of Dominican-American writers, such as [[Angie Cruz]], [[Loida Maritza Pérez]], [[Nelly Rosario]], and [[Junot Díaz]], have been inspired by Alvarez's success.<ref name="coonrod8" />  Alvarez has admitted that:

: "..the bad part of being a 'Latina Writer' is that people want to make me into a spokesperson. There is no spokesperson! There are many realities, different shades and classes".<ref name="sirias6">{{harvnb|Sirias|2001|p= 6}}</ref>

''How the García Girls Lost Their Accents'' is the first novel by a Dominican-American woman to receive widespread acclaim and attention in the United States.<ref name="mccracken31">{{harvnb|McCracken|1999|p= 31}}</ref> The book portrays ethnic identity as problematic on several levels. Alvarez challenges commonly held assumptions of multiculturalism as strictly positive. She views much of immigrant identity as greatly affected by ethnic, gendered, and class conflict.<ref name="mccracken31" /> According to critic Ellen McCracken:

: "Transgression and incestuous overtones may not be the usual fare of the mainstream’s desirable multicultural commodity, but Alvarez’s deployment of such narrative tactics foregrounds the centrality of the struggle against abuse of patriarchal power in this Dominican American’s early contribution to the new Latina narrative of the 1990s."<ref>{{harvnb|McCracken|1999|p= 32}}</ref>

Regarding the women's movement in writing, Alvarez explains:

: "...definitely, still, there is a glass ceiling in terms of female novelists. If we have a female character, she might be engaging in something monumental but she’s also changing the diapers and doing the cooking, still doing things which get it called a woman’s novel. You know, a man’s novel is universal; a woman’s novel is for women."<ref>Qtd. in {{harvnb|Coonrod Martínez|2007|pp= 6, 8}}</ref>

Alvarez claims that her aim is not simply to write for women, but to also deal with universal themes that illustrate a more general interconnectedness.<ref name="coonrod8" /> She explains:

: "What I try to do with my writing is to move out into those other selves, other worlds. To become more and more of us."<ref name="kevane32">{{harvnb|Kevane|2001|p= 32}}</ref> 

As an illustration of this point, Alvarez writes in English about issues in the Dominican Republic, using a combination of both English and Spanish.<ref name="kevane32"/> Alvarez feels empowered by the notion of populations and cultures around the world mixing, and because of this, identifies as a "Citizen of the World".<ref name="kevane32"/>

==Grants and honors==
Alvarez has received grants from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] and the [[Ingram Merrill Foundation]]. Some of her poetry manuscripts now have a permanent home in the [[New York Public Library]], where her work was featured in an exhibit, "The Hand of the Poet: Original Manuscripts by 100 Masters, From John Donne to Julia Alvarez."<ref name="bookreporter1">{{citation|chapter-url= http://www.bookreporter.com/authors/au-alvarez-julia.asp |chapter= Julia Alvarez |title= Bookreporter.com |publisher= The Book Report |access-date=2008-11-11}}</ref> She received the Lamont Prize from the [[Academy of American Poets]] in 1974, first prize in narrative from the Third Woman Press Award in 1986, and an award from the General Electric Foundation in 1986.<ref name="english.emory.edu">{{citation|url=http://www.english.emory.edu/Bahri/Alvarez.html |title= Julia Alvarez Biography |publisher= Emory University |access-date=2008-12-04}}</ref> In 2009, she received the Fitzgerald Award for Achievement in American Literature.

''How the García Girls Lost Their Accents'' was the winner of the 1991 [[PEN Oakland/Josephine Miles Literary Award]] for works that present a multicultural viewpoint.<ref name="english.emory.edu"/> ''Yo!'' was selected as a notable book by the [[American Library Association]] in 1998. ''Before We Were Free'' won the [[Belpre Medal]] in 2004,<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/alsc/awardsgrants/bookmedia/belpremedal/belprepast/index.cfm |title=The Pura Belpré Award winners |publisher= American Library Association |access-date= 2010-09-26}}</ref> and ''Return to Sender'' won the Belpre Medal in 2010.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/alsc/awardsgrants/bookmedia/belpremedal/index.cfm |title=2010 Author Award Winner |publisher= American Library Association |access-date= 2010-09-26}}</ref> She also received the 2002 [[Hispanic Heritage Foundation|Hispanic Heritage Award in Literature]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Hispanic Heritage Awards for Literature|url=http://www.hispanicheritage.org/hispanic_search.php?name=&opt2=10&opt3=0&x=6&y=10|publisher=Hispanic Heritage Foundation|access-date=11 January 2011}}</ref>
