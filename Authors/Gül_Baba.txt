== Biography ==
A native of [[Merzifon]] (''Marsiwān'', in the [[Wilayah|vilāyet]] of [[Sivas, Turkey|Sivas]], Anatolia),<ref>Houtsma, M Th et al. (Eds.). (1993).  ''E.J. Brill's First Encyclopaedia of Islam, 1913–1936''. Brill. {{ISBN|90-04-09796-1}}, p. 181.</ref> he was the son of Kutb’ül Arifin Veli’üddin İbn Yalınkılıç. In [[Hungary]], Gül Baba is known as the "Father of [[Rose]]s," a literal translation of the meaning of his names in Turkish; he is said to have introduced the flower to the country. However, this is likely a misunderstanding of the metaphorical meaning of the Turkish name, which referred to the dervish's status derived from his deep mystical knowledge of [[Allah]]. Roses, wild and domesticated, were already in Hungary by the time of the Ottoman invasion.  The name could also be a corruption of ''Kel Baba'', meaning "Bald Father".

Gül Baba is thought to have died in [[Buda]] during the first [[Muslim]] religious ceremony held after the Ottoman victory of 1541, or alternatively to have been killed during fighting below the walls of the city on August 21, 1541. Suleiman, who was also [[Ottoman Caliphate|Caliph]], declared him [[patron saint]] of the city and is reputed to have been one of the coffin bearers. Gül Baba's descendants are the Marzioglu family, some of whom were the pashas of the [[Trebizond Vilayet]].

{{Main|Tomb of Gül Baba}}
Gül Baba's octagonal tomb (''[[türbe]]'') is located on Mecset (mosque) Street, [[Budapest]], a short but steep walk from the [[Margaret Bridge]] in the district of [[Rózsadomb]]. It was built by [[Ottoman Hungary|Ottoman authorities in Hungary]] between 1543 and 1548, on the orders of the third [[pasha]] of Buda, and has a shallow dome covered with lead plates and wooden tiles.<ref>Peterson, Andrew (1994). ''Dictionary of Islamic Architecture''. London: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-06084-2}}, p. 112.</ref> It was left undamaged when the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] armies captured the area during the [[Battle of Buda (1686)|Second Battle of Buda]] in 1686, but was converted into a [[Roman Catholicism in Hungary|Roman Catholic]] chapel by the [[Jesuits]], who renamed it "St Joseph's Chapel".

The land later came under the ownership of János Wagner, who maintained the site and allowed access to Muslim [[pilgrim]]s coming from the Ottoman Empire (''see [[Islam in Hungary]]''). In 1885, the Ottoman government commissioned a Hungarian engineer to restore the tomb and, when work was completed in 1914, it was declared a national monument. The site was restored again in the 1960s and in the 1990s and is now the property of the [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]]. A large-scale renovation was completed in October 2018, when the site was inaugurated by Hungarian prime minister [[Viktor Orbán]] and Turkish president [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]].
<!--disputed: See "Bolghar" on that matter: The mausoleum is the northernmost site of [[Islam]]ic pilgrimage.-->
