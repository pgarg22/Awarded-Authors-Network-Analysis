'''Kenneth Charles Marion Rexroth''' (December 22, 1905 &ndash; June 6, 1982) was an American poet, translator, and critical essayist. He is regarded as a central figure in the [[San Francisco Renaissance]], and paved the groundwork for the movement.<ref name=poet>{{cite web|url=http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/1270|title=Kenneth Rexroth|publisher=The [[Academy of American Poets]]}}</ref> Although he did not consider himself to be a [[Beat poet]], and disliked the association, he was dubbed the "Father of the Beats" by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.<ref name="Hamill-1997" /> Largely self-educated, Rexroth learned several languages and translated poems from Chinese, French, Spanish, and Japanese.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kenneth Rexroth |url=https://www.modernamericanpoetry.org/poet/kenneth-rexroth |website=Modern American Poetry |access-date=25 February 2021}}</ref>

==Early years==
Rexroth was born Kenneth Charles Marion Rexroth in [[South Bend]], [[Indiana]],<ref name=pn>{{cite journal|title=News & Notes|journal=PN Review|date=February 1983|volume=9|issue=3|url=http://www.pnreview.co.uk/cgi-bin/scribe?item_id=6752|access-date=2 November 2014}}</ref> the son of Charles Rexroth, a pharmaceuticals salesman, and Delia Reed. His childhood was troubled by his father's [[alcoholism]] and his mother's chronic illness. His mother died in 1916 and his father in 1919, after which he went to live with his aunt in [[Chicago]] and enrolled in the [[Art Institute of Chicago]].

At age nineteen, he hitchhiked across the country, taking odd jobs and working a stint as a [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] trail crew hand, cook, and packer in the [[Pacific Northwest]], at the [[Marblemount, Washington|Marblemount]] Ranger Station.<ref name="Suiter 2002, pg. 81">Suiter 2002, p. 81</ref> Later he was able to board a steamship in [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], exploring [[Mexico]] and [[South America]] before spending a week in [[Paris]] to meet many notable [[avant-garde]] figures, notably [[Tristan Tzara]] and the [[Surrealism|Surrealists]]. He considered staying on in Paris, but an American friend urged him not to become just another expatriate and he returned home.

After meeting his first wife, he moved to [[San Francisco]]; he would live in [[California]] the rest of his life.

==Love, marriage, sacrament==
Rexroth viewed love for another person as a [[sacrament]]al act that could connect one with a transcendent, universal awareness. In his introduction to his poem ''The Phoenix and the Tortoise,'' Rexroth articulated his understanding of love and marriage: "The process as I see it goes something like this: from abandon to erotic mysticism, from erotic mysticism to the ethical mysticism of sacramental marriage, thence to the realization of the ethical mysticism of universal responsibility."<ref>[http://www.bopsecrets.org/rexroth/poems/prefaces.htm ''Prefaces to Rexroth's Poetry'']</ref>

In 1927, at age 22, Rexroth married Andrée Dutcher, a commercial artist and painter from Chicago. He claimed to have fallen in love with her at first sight when he saw her in the doorway of the apartment building he was renting. He encouraged Dutcher to pursue non-commercial painting, and she gave him feedback on his writing. The two shared many interests and what Rexroth described as a perfect relationship. Their marriage deteriorated, however, and the couple was divorced near Rexroth's 35th birthday. Andrée died of complications from [[epilepsy]] shortly after, in 1940. Her death triggered great sadness in Rexroth, who wrote a number of elegiac poems in her honor.

Within a year of Andrée's death, Rexroth married the nurse and poet Marie Kass. They opened up their home to weekly literary discussions, anti-war protesters, and Japanese-American convalescents avoiding internment. The two separated in 1948.

In 1949, Rexroth traveled to Europe with Marthe Larsen. The two were married in [[Aix-en-Provence]] despite Rexroth still being legally married to Marie. When the couple returned to the US, Marthe was pregnant. They had had two daughters, Mary and Katherine, by 1955, when Rexroth's divorce from Marie finally came through. In 1956, Marthe fell in love with the poet [[Robert Creeley]], and she later left Rexroth despite his desperate pleas for her to stay. Rexroth later removed all instances of her name from his poetry.

After living in San Francisco for 41 years, Rexroth moved to Santa Barbara in 1968. He taught two courses at UCSB. After a few years, he married Carol Tinker, his longtime assistant. They remained married until Rexroth's death in 1982.

==Poetic influences==
In the 1930s, Rexroth was associated with the [[Objectivism (poetry)|Objectivists]], a largely New York group gathered around [[Louis Zukofsky]] and [[George Oppen]].<ref>{{cite book |editor-last= McAllister|editor-first= Andrew |date=1996 |title= The Objectivists |url= |location=Eastburn |publisher= Bloodaxe Books|pages= 12-13|isbn=9781852243418 |author-link= }}</ref> and was included in the 1931 issue of ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'' magazine dedicated to Objectivist poetry, and in the 1932 ''[[Objectivism (poetry)# Reaction|An “Objectivists” Anthology]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://z-site.net/biblio-research/the-objectivists-and-their-publications/ |title=The “Objectivists” and Their Publications|last=Scroggins |first=Mark |date= |website=Z-site, A Companion to the Works of Louis Zukofsky |publisher=Z-site |access-date=17 July 2021 |quote= }}</ref>

Rexroth was the central figure in San Francisco Bay Area poetry from the 1930s through the 1960s and exercised a major and early influence over the evolution of the area's local artistic culture and social counterculture.  Bay Area poetry in the 1940s and 1950s was substantially the creation of Rexroth, along with Robert Duncan, William Everson (Brother Antoninus), Philip Lamantia, Jack Spicer, Bob Kaufman, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, and others, and Rexroth's centrality was generally acknowledged.  His prose on social subjects was an incitement, a participant, a witness and a history of the emergence of this counterculture.  His weekly column for the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' was, while it survived, a lodestar of this movement.  Rexroth was deeply involved in anarchist-libertarian political circles in San Francisco from the early 1930s and as such was deeply opposed to American intervention in foreign conflicts.  He and his wife Mary were intensively active, alongside anarchist and Quaker friends, in working to help California Japanese avoid internment in 1942 and lessen its harm.  In the late 1940s he was instrumental in the founding of radio station KPFA-Berkeley, a pioneer in cooperative public radio where he conducted a weekly book-review hour, recorded from his bathtub at home.  For the emergent poets of the San Francisco Renaissance and, later, visiting Beat poets, he was the central figure of the local poetic avant garde scene as a node in international artistic culture.  His ''An Autobiographical Novel'' is a primary witness to this period of importance.  It was labeled "autobiographical" to evade legal entanglements.

Much of Rexroth's work can be classified as "erotic" or "love poetry", given his deep fascination with transcendent love. According to [[Sam Hamill|Hamill]] and Kleiner, "nowhere is Rexroth's verse more fully realized than in his erotic poetry".<ref name=Hamill-1997>{{cite book |editor1-last=Sam Hamill |editor1-first=Sam |editor2-last=Kleiner |editor2-first=Elaine Laura |title=Sacramental Acts: The Love Poems of Kenneth Rexroth |date=1997 |publisher=Copper Canyon Press |isbn=9781556590801 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UXzPuQEACAAJ |access-date=25 February 2021}}</ref>

His poetry is marked by a sensitivity to [[Culture of Asia|Asian cultural]] forms as well as an appreciation of Ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[lyric poetry]], particularly that of [[Sappho]]. Rexroth's poetic voice is similar to that of [[Tu Fu]] (whom he translated), expressing indignation with the inequities of the world from an [[Existentialism|existential]] perspective.

During the 1970s Rexroth, along with the scholar [[Chung Ling]], translated the notable [[Song Dynasty]] poet [[Li Ch'ing-chao]] and an anthology of Chinese women poets, titled ''The Orchid Boat''.

With ''The Love Poems of Marichiko'', Rexroth claimed to have translated the poetry of a contemporary, "young Japanese woman poet", but it was later disclosed that he was the author, and he gained critical recognition for having conveyed so authentically the feelings of someone of another gender and culture.<ref name="weinberger117-8">Weinberger 1986, pp. 117-118</ref> Linda Hamalian, his biographer, suggests that, "translating the work of women poets from China and Japan reveals a transformation of both heart and mind".<ref name="Hamill-1997"/>

Rexroth's poetry, essays, and journalism reflect his interests in [[jazz]], politics, culture, and ecology.

==The Beat Generation==
[[File:Kenneth Rexroth Street.jpg|thumb|Kenneth Rexroth Street in San Francisco, California]]
With Rexroth acting as master of ceremonies, [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Philip Lamantia]], [[Michael McClure]], [[Gary Snyder]], and [[Philip Whalen]] performed at the famous [[Six Gallery reading]] on October 7, 1955. Rexroth later testified as a defense witness at Ferlinghetti's [[obscenity]] trial for publishing Howl. Rexroth had previously sent Ginsberg (new in the Bay Area) to meet Snyder, and was thus responsible for their friendship. [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]] named Rexroth as one of his own mentors.<ref>{{cite web |title=Legendary Beat Generation Bookseller and Poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti of City Lights Books on the 50th Anniversary of Jack Kerouac's "On the Road," Allen Ginsberg's "Howl" and Poetry as Insurgent Art |url=https://www.democracynow.org/2007/12/24/legendary_beat_generation_bookseller_and_poet |website=Democracy Now |access-date=25 February 2021 |format=Interview |date=December 24, 2007}}</ref>

Rexroth was eventually critical of the Beat movement. Years after the Six Gallery reading, ''Time'' referred to him as "Father of the [[Beat Generation|Beats]].<ref name="Hamill-1997" /> To this he replied, "an [[entomology|entomologist]] is not a bug."

Rexroth ostensibly appears in [[Jack Kerouac]]'s novel ''[[The Dharma Bums]]'' as Reinhold Cacoethes.<ref>Beat Museum, The. "Books by Jack Kerouac-Real Names and their Aliases". self-published, N.D., unpaginated.</ref>

==Politics==
As a young man in Chicago, Rexroth was involved with the [[anarchism|anarchist]] movement and was active in the [[Industrial Workers of the World|IWW]],<ref name="Suiter 2002, pg. 81"/> attending and participating in politically charged readings and lectures. He was a regular at meetings of the [[Washington Square Park, Chicago|Washington Park]] Bug Club, a loose assemblage of  intellectuals and revolutionaries. Such relationships allowed him to recite poems by other writers as well as gain experience with the political climate and revolutionary currents of the day.

[[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]] recalled that Rexroth self-identified as a [[Philosophical anarchism|philosophical anarchist]], regularly associated with other anarchists in [[North Beach, San Francisco, California|North Beach]], and sold Italian anarchist newspapers at the [[City Lights Bookstore]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/poetry/features/0,,1815401,00.html |title=Last of the bohemians |access-date=2008-06-08 |last=Wroe |first=Nicholas |work=The Guardian|format=Interview|quote=He called himself a 'philosophical anarchist'... | location=London | date=July 1, 2006}}</ref>

His ideas later coalesced into a concept that he termed the "social lie": that societies are governed by tactics of deception in order to maintain a hierarchy of exploitation and servitude. He saw this as pervasive in all elements of culture, including popular literature, education, and social norms.

Rexroth, a pacifist, was a [[conscientious objector]] during [[World War II]]<ref name="Suiter 2002, pg. 81"/> and worked to help [[Japanese-American]]s [[Japanese American internment|forcibly sent to internment camps during the war.]]

==Last years==
Rexroth died in Santa Barbara on June 6, 1982.<ref name=pn/> He had spent his final years translating Japanese and Chinese women poets, as well as promoting the work of female poets in America and overseas. The year before his death, on Easter, Rexroth converted to Roman Catholicism.<ref name="Hamalian 1991, p. 367">Hamalian 1991, p. 367</ref> He is buried on the grounds of the Santa Barbara Cemetery Association.
