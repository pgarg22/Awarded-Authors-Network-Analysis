'''Michael Frayn''', [[FRSL]] ({{IPAc-en|f|r|eɪ|n}}; born 8 September 1933) is an English [[playwright]] and [[novelist]]. He is best known as the author of the farce ''[[Noises Off]]''<ref>"Michael Frayn British author and translator," ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' https://www.britannica.com/biography/Michael-Frayn Retrieved 6 August 2017.</ref> and the dramas ''[[Copenhagen (play)|Copenhagen]]'' and  ''[[Democracy (play)|Democracy]]''.  His novels, such as ''[[Towards the End of the Morning]]'', ''[[Headlong (Frayn novel)|Headlong]]'' and ''[[Spies (novel)|Spies]]'', have also been critical and commercial successes, making him one of the handful of writers in the English language to succeed in both drama and prose fiction.  He has also written philosophical works, such as ''The Human Touch: Our Part in the Creation of the Universe'' (2006).

==Early life==
Frayn was born at [[Mill Hill]] (then in [[Middlesex]]) to Thomas Allen Frayn, an asbestos salesman from a working-class family of blacksmiths, locksmiths and servants, in which deafness was hereditary, and his wife Violet Alice (née Lawson). Violet was the daughter of a failed [[palliasse]] merchant; having studied as a violinist at the [[Royal Academy of Music]], she worked as a shop assistant and occasional clothes model at [[Harrods]]. After the slump in asbestos prices, Frayn's sister supported the family by also working at Harrods, as a children's hairdresser.<ref>My Father's Fortune, A Life by Michael Frayn, Faber and Faber, 2010, pp. 12-14, 28-29, 225</ref><ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/aug/16/michael-Frayn-interview 2009 Interview] in the ''[[The Observer|Observer]]''</ref> He grew up in [[Ewell]], [[Surrey]], and was educated at [[Kingston Grammar School]]. Following two years of [[National Service]], during which he learned Russian at the [[Joint Services School for Linguists]], Frayn read Moral Sciences ([[Philosophy]]) at [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge|Emmanuel College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], graduating in 1957. He then worked as a reporter and columnist for ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Observer]]'', where he established a reputation as a [[satire|satirist]] and comic writer, and began publishing his plays and novels.

==Works==
The play ''[[Copenhagen (play)|Copenhagen]]'' deals with a historical event, a 1941 meeting between the Danish [[physics|physicist]] [[Niels Bohr]] and his protégé, the German [[Werner Heisenberg]], when Denmark is under German occupation, and Heisenberg is—maybe?—working on the development of an [[atomic bomb]]. Frayn was attracted to the topic because it seemed to 'encapsulate something about the difficulty of knowing why people do what they do and
there is a parallel between that and the impossibility that Heisenberg established in physics, about ever knowing everything about the behaviour of physical objects'.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://sounds.bl.uk/View.aspx?item=024M-1CDR0025481X-0100V0.xml
| title = Interview with Michael Frayn| publisher = British Library (sound recording)}}</ref> The play explores various possibilities.

Frayn's more recent play ''Democracy'' ran successfully in London (the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]], 2003-4 and [[West End theatre|West End]] transfer), [[Copenhagen]] and on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] ([[Brooks Atkinson Theatre]], 2004-5); it dramatised the story of the German chancellor [[Willy Brandt]] and his personal assistant, the East German spy [[Günter Guillaume]]. Five years later, again at the National Theatre, it was followed by ''[[Afterlife (play)|Afterlife]]'', a biographical drama of the life of the great Austrian impresario [[Max Reinhardt]], director of the [[Salzburg]] Festival, which opened at the Lyttelton Theatre in June 2008, starring [[Roger Allam]] as Reinhardt.<ref>Fiona Maddocks, "The History Play Man; Daring: Frayn's Drama Slips in and out of Rhyming Couplets "To Blur the Distinction between Theatre and Life Just as Rheinhardt Did," ''The Evening Standard'', 3 June 2008.</ref>

His other original plays include two evenings of short plays, ''The Two of Us'' and ''Alarms and Excursions'', the philosophical comedies ''Alphabetical Order'', ''[[Benefactors (play)|Benefactors]]'', ''Clouds'', ''Make and Break'' and ''[[Here (play)|Here]]'', and the farces ''Donkeys' Years'', ''[[Balmoral (play)|Balmoral]]'' (also known as ''Liberty Hall''), and ''[[Noises Off]]'', which critic [[Frank Rich]] in his book ''The Hot Seat'' claimed "is, was, and probably always will be the funniest play written in my lifetime."

His novels include [[Headlong (Frayn novel)|''Headlong'']] (shortlisted for the 1999 [[Booker Prize]]), ''[[The Tin Men]]'' (won the 1966 [[Somerset Maugham Award]]), ''The Russian Interpreter'' (1967, [[Hawthornden Prize]])  ''[[Towards the End of the Morning]]'', ''Sweet Dreams'', ''A Landing on the Sun'', [[A Very Private Life (novel)|''A Very Private Life'']], ''Now You Know'' and ''[[Skios]]'' (long-listed for the Man Booker Prize in 2012). His novel, ''[[Spies (novel)|Spies]]'', was long-listed for the Man Booker Prize and won the [[Whitbread Prize]] for Fiction in 2002. He has also written a book about philosophy, ''Constructions'', and a book of his own philosophy, ''The Human Touch''.

His columns for ''The Guardian'' and ''The Observer'' (collected in ''The Day of the Dog'', ''The Book of Fub'' and ''On the Outskirts'') are models of the comic essay; in the 1980s a number of them were adapted and performed for [[BBC Radio 4]] by [[Martin Jarvis (actor)|Martin Jarvis]].

He has also written screenplays for the films ''[[Clockwise (film)|Clockwise]]'', starring [[John Cleese]], ''First and Last'' starring [[Tom Wilkinson]], ''Birthday'', ''Jamie on a Flying Visit'', and the TV series ''Making Faces'', starring [[Eleanor Bron]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0292450/|title=Michael Frayn|website=IMDb}}</ref>

He is now considered to be Britain's finest translator of [[Anton Chekhov]]<ref>Donald Rayfield, "Review: Chekhov: Four Plays and Three Jokes by Sharon Marie  - adapting the four major plays", ''Translation and Literature''
Vol. 20, No. 3, Translating Russia, 1890-1935 (Autumn 2011), pp. 408-410?</ref> (''[[The Seagull]]'', ''[[Uncle Vanya]]'', ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]'' and ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]'') as well as an early untitled work, which he titled ''[[Wild Honey (play)|Wild Honey]]'' (other translations of the work have called it ''[[Platonov (play)|Platonov]]'' or ''Don Juan in the Russian Manner'') and a number of Chekhov's smaller plays for an evening called ''[[The Sneeze (play)|The Sneeze]]'' (originally performed on the West End by [[Rowan Atkinson]]).

He also translated [[Yuri Trifonov]]'s play ''Exchange'', [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[The Fruits of Enlightenment]]'', and [[Jean Anouilh]]'s ''Number One''.

In 1980, he presented the Australian journey of the [[BBC]] television series ''[[Great Railway Journeys of the World]]''. His journey took him from [[Sydney]] to [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] on the [[Indian Pacific]] with side visits to the [[Lithgow Zig Zag]] and a journey on [[The Ghan]]'s old route from [[Marree, South Australia|Marree]] to [[Alice Springs]] shortly before the opening of the new line from [[Tarcoola, South Australia|Tarcoola]] to [[Alice Springs]].

Frayn's wife, [[Claire Tomalin]], is a biographer and literary journalist.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/michael-frayn-and-claire-tomalin-a-marriage-between-the-sheets-128000.html | title=Michael Frayn and Claire Tomalin: A marriage between the sheets| date=2002-11-17}}</ref>

==Frayn and Samuel Beckett==
Among the ashes of the Beckettian paralysis of modern man and the Brechtian call for political activism through plying the ‘alienation effect,’ a Fraynian phoenix emerged, which had absorbed both of them. Frayn’s works reflected the indeterminacy yet did not find it repulsive or dark. Frayn does not regard uncertainty as a tragic element in modern man’s life but finds an opportunity to make entertaining comedy out of the fact. While Beckett’s uncertainty produces plays full of anxiety, Frayn convinces the audience that this is a typical situation in life that can be regarded through its comic effect. Frayn regards the text of a play as only one of the elements in its production and insists on receiving the notion of theatre as an alloy made of many particles. He embraces the uncertainty of life and applies it to performing a play. His brilliance shows face in standing against advocates of nihilism who portray the new world as a dark, gloomy flux of uncertain data. Beckett’s characters are not responsible for anything; they are stuck in a situation and paralyzed while Frayn gives them choices and lets them mobility throughout the play. His work is philosophical yet in a grotesque combination with comedy, its final product entertains the audience rather than pushing them into the uncomfortable sense of indeterminacy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mohammadi|first=Midia|date=2021|title=The Art of Uncertainty: A Scrutiny in Theatre of Michael Frayn|url=https://ijels.com/detail/the-art-of-uncertainty-a-scrutiny-in-theatre-of-michael-frayn/|journal=International Journal of English Literature and Social Sciences|volume=6|issue=3|pages=245–252|doi=10.22161/ijels.63.33}}</ref>
