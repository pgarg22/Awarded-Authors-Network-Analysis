==Background and education==

Edson was born in [[Washington, D.C.]], the second child of [[Checkers speech#Development of the story|Peter Edson]], a newspaper columnist, and Joyce Winifred Edson, a medical social worker. Like the protagonist in ''[[Wit (play)|Wit]]'', Edson is well acquainted with academia. A graduate of [[Sidwell Friends School]], a [[Society of Friends|Quaker]]-run private school in Washington, where she had been active in the drama program, Edson enrolled at [[Smith College]] in Massachusetts in 1979, earning a degree in [[Renaissance|Renaissance history]] in 1983. After graduation, Edson moved to [[Iowa City, Iowa]], where her sister lived, and took a job selling hot dogs during the day and tending bar at night.<ref name=bio1/>

She returned to her hometown of [[Washington, D.C.]], and acquired a job as unit clerk in the [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] and cancer treatment wing of a research hospital.<ref name=bio1/> Subsequently, she moved to the St. Francis Center (now the Wendt Center for Loss and Healing), where she worked on producing grant proposals. At this point, Edson decided to pursue a doctorate in literature, but first wished to write a play. Edson worked at a bicycle store in Washington and spent the summer of 1991 writing the first draft of ''Wit''.<ref name=bio1>Cameron, Gail.

It was finally accepted in 1995 by the [[South Coast Repertory]] (SCR) in [[Costa Mesa, California]]. The artistic team at South Coast Repertory worked with Edson to condense her two-act play into one act. The revised ''Wit'' was produced at SCR in 1995 <ref>{{cite news | author=Vincent Canby | title=Battered and Broken, So That She May Rise | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0DEEDE143AF93BA25753C1A96E958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | date=18 October 1998 | access-date=2008-03-29}}</ref> and won 1995 Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Awards for Production, Direction (Martin Benson), Writing, Lead Performance (Megan Cole), Lighting Design (Paulie Jenkins), and the Ted Schmitt Award.<ref>[http://ladramacriticscircle.com/1990-1999-awards/ "1990-1999 Awards"] ladramacriticscircle.com, accessed November 6, 2015</ref>

Despite ''Wit's'' success at SCR,  other theater companies were reluctant to produce the play. In 1997, the young director Derek Anson Jones was chosen by the [[Long Wharf Theatre]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], to create a new production of the play. ''Wit'' opened in November 1997 at the Long Wharf Theatre, directed by Jones and starring [[Kathleen Chalfant]] and featuring [[Walter Charles]] and Alec Phoenix as her doctors and Paula Pizzi as her nurse.<ref>{{cite news|author=Alvin Klein|title=Dauntless Spirit, Life of the Mind|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A05E0DF1638F935A25752C1A961958260|work=The New York Times|date=16 November 1997|access-date=2008-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Peter Marks|title=For a Scholar Near Death, A Dose of Deconstruction|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980CE3DB123AF93BA15752C1A961958260|work=The New York Times|date=28 November 1997|access-date=2008-03-29}}</ref> The play earned strong word-of-mouth reviews and  won three [[Connecticut Critics Circle Award]]s, including best play.
