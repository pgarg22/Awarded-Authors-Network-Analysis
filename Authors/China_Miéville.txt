== Early life and education==
Miéville was born in [[Norwich]] and brought up in [[Willesden]], and has lived in [[London]] since early childhood. He grew up with his sister Jemima and mother Claudia. His mother was a translator, writer and teacher, and the daughter of Leo Claude Vaux Miéville, whose wife Youla (née Harrison) was granddaughter of the 4th [[Baron Hatherton]].<ref name="Debrett 1995">Debrett's Peerage and Baronetage, ed. Patrick Montague-Smith, Debrett's Peerage Ltd, 1995, p. 1264</ref><ref>Burke's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage, 107th edition, vol. 2, Burke's Peerage Ltd, 2003, p. 1823</ref> Miéville's parents separated soon after his birth, and he has said that he "never really knew" his father.<ref name=Gordon1>{{cite journal | last = Gordon | first = Joan | title = Reveling in Genre: An Interview with China Miéville | journal = Science Fiction Studies | publisher = DePauw University | url = http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/interviews/mievilleinterview.htm | volume = 30 | issue = Part 3 | date = November 2003 |access-date=2 August 2012}}</ref> His parents chose his first name, China, from a dictionary, looking for a beautiful name.<ref name=Gordon1/> By virtue of his mother's birth in New York City, Miéville holds dual American and British citizenship. In 1982 his mother married Paul Lightfoot; they divorced in 1992.<ref name="Debrett 1995"/><ref>Burke's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage, 107th edition, vol. 3, Burke's Peerage Ltd, 2003, p. 3983</ref><ref>Between Equal Rights: A Marxist Theory of International Law, China Miéville, Haymarket Books, 2006, p. v</ref>

Miéville attended [[Oakham School]], a co-educational independent school in [[Oakham]], [[Rutland]], for two years. At the age of eighteen, in 1990, he taught English for a year in Egypt, where he developed an interest in Arab culture and in Middle Eastern politics. Miéville studied for a BA degree in [[social anthropology]] at [[Clare College, Cambridge]], graduating in 1994, and gained both a master's degree and PhD in [[international relations]] from the [[London School of Economics]] in 2001. Miéville has also held a [[Frank Knox Memorial Fellowships|Frank Knox fellowship]] at [[Harvard University]].<ref name=Gordon1/> After becoming dissatisfied with the ability of post-modern theories to explain history and political events, he became a [[Marxist]] at university.<ref name=Gordon1/> A book version of his PhD thesis, entitled ''Between Equal Rights: A Marxist Theory of International Law'', was published in the UK in 2005 by [[Brill Publishers|Brill]] in their "Historical Materialism" series, and in the United States in 2006 by [[Haymarket Books]].

== Literary influences ==
Miéville's works all describe fantastical or supernatural worlds or scenarios.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/5540368/The-City-and-the-City-by-China-Mieville-review.html | title = The City and the City by China Miéville: review | last = Hanks | first = Robert | date = 15 June 2009 | newspaper = [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] | access-date = 17 October 2013 | quote = He has twice won the Arthur C Clarke award for science fiction, but sci-fi purists complain that his frequent breaches of the laws of nature – magic, in other words – place him in the 'fantasy' camp. [...] A more precise category might be 'urban surrealism': surveying his career so far, it looks as if his central concern is life in the modern city, though filtered through dreams and nightmares.}}</ref> Miéville has said he plans to write a novel in every genre.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.long-sunday.net/long_sunday/2005/07/a_truly_monstro.html | title= A Truly Monstrous Thing to Do: Mieville Interview | interviewer=| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091012023448/http://www.long-sunday.net/long_sunday/2005/07/a_truly_monstro.html |archivedate= 12 October 2009 | website= Long-Sunday.net}}</ref> To this end, he has "constructed an oeuvre" that ranges from classic American [[Western (genre)|Western]] (in ''[[Iron Council]]'') to sea-quest (in ''[[The Scar (novel)|The Scar]]'') to detective [[Noir fiction|noir]] (in ''[[The City &amp; the City]]'').<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tor.com/2014/10/14/a-category-unto-himself-the-works-of-china-mieville/ | title = A Category Unto Himself: The Works of = China Miéville | last = Shurin | first = Jared | date = 4 August 2015 | website= tor.com | publisher = [[Tor Books]] | access-date = 24 April 2016}}</ref>

Miéville has listed [[M. John Harrison]], [[Michael de Larrabeiti]], [[Michael Moorcock]], [[Thomas M. Disch]], [[Charles Williams (British writer)|Charles Williams]], [[Tim Powers]], and [[J. G. Ballard]] as literary "heroes"; he has also frequently discussed as influences [[H. P. Lovecraft]], [[Mervyn Peake]], [[Ursula K. Le Guin]], and [[Gene Wolfe]]. He has said that he would like his novels "to be read for [his imagined city] New Crobuzon as [[Iain Sinclair]] does for London". Miéville has admitted that his books contain some allusions to Russian writers, including [[Andrei Platonov]], [[Arkady and Boris Strugatsky]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Evgeny Voiskunskyru|3=Войскунский, Евгений Львович|lt=Evgeny Voiskunsky|ru|vertical-align=sup}} and {{Interlanguage link multi|Isai Lukodyanov|ru|3=Лукодьянов, Исай Борисович|lt=Isai Lukodyanov|vertical-align=sup}}.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://gorky.media/intervyu/nadeyus-nikto-ne-sochtet-oktyabr-nekritichnoy-agiografiey/ |title= Nadeyus' Nikto Ne Sochtet Oktyabr' Nekrtichnoy Agiografiey |last=Maltsev |first=Mikhail |date=25 October 2017 |access-date=9 January 2019 |language= ru |trans-title=I Hope Nobody Will Count That ''October'' Is an Uncritical Hagiography}}</ref>

Miéville played a great deal of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' and similar [[roleplaying game]]s (RPGs) in his youth. He has attributed his tendency to systematisation of magic and theology to this influence.<ref name=Gordon1 /> In his novel ''[[Perdido Street Station]]'', he refers to characters interested "only in gold and experience". The February 2007 issue of [[Dragon (magazine)|''Dragon'' magazine]] interpreted the world presented in his books according to ''Dungeons & Dragons'' rules. The ''[[List of Dungeons & Dragons rulebooks#Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition|Player's Handbook]]'' for [[Editions of Dungeons & Dragons#5th Edition Dungeons & Dragons|the fifth edition of Dungeons & Dragons]] cited his novel ''Perdido Street Station'' as a source of inspiration for the game's designers.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_playershandbook| title= RPG Player's Handbook| website= DnD.wizards.com | publisher= | date= | accessdate= }}</ref>

In 2010, Miéville made his first foray into writing for RPGs with a contribution to the ''[[Pathfinder Roleplaying Game]]'' supplement ''Guide to the River Kingdoms''.<ref>{{cite web| website= paizo.com| url= http://paizo.com/store/downloads/pathfinder/pathfinderChronicles/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8d50 |title= Pathfinder Chronicles: Guide to the River Kingdoms (PFRPG) Print Edition| publisher= Paizo Publishing |date= | accessdate= }}</ref>

Miéville once described [[Tolkien]] as "the wen on the arse of fantasy literature".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.panmacmillan.com/displayPage.asp?PageID=3395 | title = Scar by China Mieville | publisher =| website= panmacmillan.com | access-date = 5 May 2011 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot= InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted= yes }}</ref> He has cited [[Michael de Larrabeiti]]'s ''[[Borrible Trilogy]]'' as one of his biggest influences, and he wrote an introduction for the trilogy's 2002 reissue (the introduction was eventually left out of the book, but appears on de Larrabeiti's website).<ref>{{cite web| first= China| last= Miéville | url= http://www.michaeldelarrabeiti.com/multimedia/articles/The%20Borribles%20Introduction%2C%20China.pdf| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061105063455/http://www.michaeldelarrabeiti.com/multimedia/articles/The%20Borribles%20Introduction%2C%20China.pdf | title= 'The Borribles'. An Introduction| date= | archivedate= November 5, 2006| accessdate= }}</ref> Miéville is also indebted to Moorcock, having cited his essay "[[Epic Pooh]]" as the source upon which he is "riffing" or even simply "cheerleading" in his critique of Tolkien-imitative fantasy.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}} Despite his criticisms, Miéville has praised Tolkien for his contributions to fantasy, especially in a 2009 blog post where he gave 5 reasons why Tolkien was praise-worthy.<ref>{{Cite web| url= https://www.amazonbookreview.com/post/3d1aa8c1-0234-498a-a075-0fd9bd419088/there-and-back-again-five-reasons-tolkien-rocks-guest-blogger-china-mieville |title=Amazon Book Review|website= amazonbookreview.com| access-date=2019-08-28}}</ref>

== Politics ==
Miéville has previously been a member of the [[International Socialist Organization]] (US) and, until 13 March 2013, was also a member of the [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]] (SWP, UK).<ref name="IS2">[http://internationalsocialismuk.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/fao-central-committee-of-socialist.html "Resigning from the Socialist Workers Party"], International Socialism, 11 March 2013</ref> He stood unsuccessfully for the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] in the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]] as a candidate for the Socialist Alliance, gaining 459 votes, i.e. 1.2%,<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/vote2001/results_constituencies/constituencies/474.stm | work = BBC News | title = BBC NEWS – VOTE 2001 – RESULTS & CONSTITUENCIES – Regent's Park & Kensington North}}</ref> in [[Regent's Park and Kensington North]], a Labour constituency.<ref>[http://news.ansible.co.uk/a168.html ''Ansible'' 168], July 2001.</ref>

In January 2013, he emerged as a critic of the SWP's leadership and in March resigned<ref name="IS2"/> over the leadership's handling of rape allegations against a SWP member.<ref>Laurie Penny, [http://www.newstatesman.com/laurie-penny/2013/01/what-does-swps-way-dealing-sex-assault-allegations-tell-us-about-left "What does the SWP's way of dealing with sex assault allegations tell us about the left?"], ''New Statesman'', 11 January 2013</ref><ref>Paul Kellogg [http://links.org.au/node/3183 "Britain: Reflections on the crisis in the Socialist Workers Party"], ''LINKS – International Journal of Socialist Renewal'' (blog), 13 January 2013.</ref>

In August 2013, Miéville was one of nine signatories (along with fellow novelist and former [[Children's Laureate]] [[Michael Rosen]], veteran film-maker and socialist [[Ken Loach]], academic [[Gilbert Achcar]] and General Secretary of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], [[Kate Hudson (activist)|Kate Hudson]]) of an open letter to the ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' newspaper announcing the foundation of a "new party of the left", to be called [[Left Unity (UK)|Left Unity]]. The letter, which claims that [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] policies on "austerity" and breaking of ties with [[trades unions]] amount to a "final betrayal of the working-class people it was founded to represent", states that Left Unity will be launched at a "founding conference" in London on 30 November 2013 and will provide, as an "alternative" to Labour, "a party that is socialist, environmentalist, feminist and opposed to all forms of discrimination".<ref name="Guardian letter" />

In 2015, he was announced as one of the founding editors of a new quarterly, ''Salvage'', with editor-in-chief Rosie Warren, editor Jamie Allinson and contributing editors [[Richard Seymour (21st-century writer)|Richard Seymour]], Magpie Corvid and Charlotte Bence.<ref>[http://salvage.zone/contributors/ Contributors] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313151115/http://salvage.zone/contributors/ |date=13 March 2018 }}, ''Salvage''.</ref>

''October'', published in 2017, documents the dramatic events of the Russian revolution. Jonathan Steele reviewed it for ''[[The Guardian]]''. Steele considers it an ideological though nuanced retelling: "known as a left-wing activist, [...] Miéville writes with the brio and excitement of an enthusiast who would have wanted the revolution to succeed. But he is primarily interested in the dramatic narrative&nbsp;– the weird facts&nbsp;– of the most turbulent year in Russia's history".<ref name="Guardian October review">{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/17/october-china-mieville-russian-revolution | title = October by China Miéville review – a brilliant retelling of the Russian Revolution | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = 17 May 2017}}</ref>
