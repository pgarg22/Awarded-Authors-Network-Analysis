He was born in [[York]] and grew up in and near [[Birmingham]] in a professional [[middle-class]] family. He attended various English independent (or [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public]]) schools and studied English at [[Christ Church, Oxford]]. After a few months in Berlin in 1928–29, he spent five years (1930–35) teaching in British private [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory schools]], then travelled to [[Iceland]] and [[China]] to write books about his journeys.

In 1939 he moved to the United States and became an American citizen in 1946, retaining his British citizenship. He taught from 1941 to 1945 in American universities, followed by occasional visiting professorships in the 1950s. From 1947 to 1957 he wintered in New York and summered in [[Ischia]]; from 1958 until the end of his life he wintered in New York (in Oxford in 1972–73) and summered in [[Kirchstetten]], [[Lower Austria]].

He came to wide public attention with his first book ''[[Poems (Auden)|Poems]]'' at the age of twenty-three in 1930; it was followed in 1932 by ''[[The Orators]]''. Three plays written in collaboration with [[Christopher Isherwood]] between 1935 and 1938 built his reputation as a left-wing political writer. Auden moved to the United States partly to escape this reputation, and his work in the 1940s, including the long poems "[[For the Time Being]]" and "[[The Sea and the Mirror]]", focused on religious themes. He won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]] for his 1947 long poem ''[[The Age of Anxiety]]'', the title of which became a popular phrase describing the modern era.<ref name="RDH-NoPage"/> From 1956 to 1961 he was [[Oxford Professor of Poetry|Professor of Poetry at Oxford]]; his lectures were popular with students and faculty, and served as the basis for his 1962 prose collection ''[[The Dyer's Hand]]''.

Auden and Isherwood maintained a lasting but intermittent sexual relationship from around 1927 to 1939, while both also had briefer but more intense relations with other men.<ref name="RDH-NoPage"/> In 1939, Auden fell in love with [[Chester Kallman]] and regarded their relationship as a marriage, but this ended in 1941 when Kallman refused to accept the faithful relations that Auden demanded. However, the two maintained their friendship, and from 1947 until Auden's death they lived in the same house or apartment in a non-sexual relationship, often collaborating on opera libretti such as that of ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'', to music by [[Igor Stravinsky]].

Auden was a prolific writer of prose essays and reviews on literary, political, psychological, and religious subjects, and he worked at various times on documentary films, poetic plays, and other forms of performance. Throughout his career he was both controversial and influential, and critical views on his work ranged from sharply dismissive—treating him as a lesser figure than [[W. B. Yeats]] and [[T. S. Eliot]]—to strongly affirmative, as in [[Joseph Brodsky]]'s statement that he had "the greatest mind of the twentieth century". After his death, his poems became known to a much wider public than during his lifetime through films, broadcasts, and popular media.

===Childhood===
[[File:54 Bootham York 4.jpg|upright|thumb|Auden's birthplace in York]]

Auden was born on [[Bootham]] in [[York]], England, to [[George Augustus Auden]] (1872–1957), a physician, and Constance Rosalie Auden (née Bicknell; 1869–1941), who had trained (but never served) as a missionary nurse.<ref>Carpenter, ''W. H. Auden'', pp. 1–12.</ref> He was the third of three sons; the eldest, George Bernard Auden (1900–1978), became a farmer, while the second, [[John Bicknell Auden]] (1903–1991), became a geologist.<ref name="Wystan">The name Wystan derives from the 9th-century [[Wigstan of Mercia|St Wystan]], who was murdered by Beorhtfrith, the son of [[Beorhtwulf of Mercia|Beorhtwulf]], king of Mercia, after Wystan objected to Beorhtfrith's plan to marry Wystan's mother. His remains were reburied at [[Repton]], Derbyshire, where they became the object of a cult; the [[St. Wystan's Church, Repton|parish church of Repton]] is dedicated to St Wystan. Auden's father, [[George Augustus Auden]], was educated at [[Repton School]].</ref> The Audens were minor [[gentry]] with a strong [[clergy|clerical]] tradition, originally of [[Rowley Regis]], later of Horninglow, [[Staffordshire]].<ref>Burke's Landed Gentry, 18th edition, vol.

===Education===
[[File:St Eds Back.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Auden's School at [[Hindhead]] in Surrey]]
Auden attended [[St Edmund's School, Hindhead]], Surrey, where he met [[Christopher Isherwood]], later famous in his own right as a novelist.<ref>{{cite book|first=Harry |last=Blamires|title=A Guide to twentieth century literature in English|year=1983|page= 130}}</ref> At thirteen he went to [[Gresham's School]] in Norfolk; there, in 1922, when his friend [[Robert Medley]] asked him if he wrote poetry, Auden first realised his vocation was to be a poet.<ref name="CarpenterNoPage"/> Soon after, he "discover(ed) that he (had) lost his faith" (through a gradual realisation that he had lost interest in religion, not through any decisive change of views).<ref>{{cite book |first=W.

In 1925 he went up to [[Christ Church, Oxford]], with a scholarship in biology; he switched to English by his second year, and was introduced to Old English poetry through the lectures of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. Friends he met at Oxford include [[Cecil Day-Lewis]], [[Louis MacNeice]], and [[Stephen Spender]]; these four were commonly though misleadingly identified in the 1930s as the "[[Auden Group]]" for their shared (but not identical) left-wing views. Auden left Oxford in 1928 with a [[British undergraduate degree classification|third-class]] degree.<ref name="CarpenterNoPage"/><ref name="DNB"/>

Auden was reintroduced to Christopher Isherwood in 1925 by his fellow student [[A. S. T. Fisher]]. For the next few years Auden sent poems to Isherwood for comments and criticism; the two maintained a sexual friendship in intervals between their relations with others. In 1935–39 they collaborated on three plays and a travel book.<ref>{{cite book | first=Richard |last=Davenport-Hines | title = Auden | author-link = Richard Davenport-Hines

From his Oxford years onward, Auden's friends uniformly described him as funny, extravagant, sympathetic, generous, and, partly by his own choice, lonely. In groups he was often dogmatic and overbearing in a comic way; in more private settings he was diffident and shy except when certain of his welcome. He was punctual in his habits, and obsessive about meeting deadlines, while choosing to live amidst physical disorder.<ref name="RDH-NoPage"/>

===Britain and Europe, 1928–1938===
In late 1928, Auden left Britain for nine months, going to [[Berlin]], perhaps partly as an escape from English repressiveness. In Berlin, he first experienced the political and economic unrest that became one of his central subjects.<ref name="DNB" /> Around the same time, Stephen Spender privately printed a small pamphlet of Auden's ''[[Poems (Auden)|Poems]]'' in an edition of about 45 copies, distributed among Auden's and Spender's friends and family; this edition is usually referred to as ''Poems'' [1928] to avoid confusion with Auden's commercially published 1930 volume.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Poems.

On returning to Britain in 1929, he worked briefly as a tutor. In 1930 his first published book, ''Poems'' (1930), was accepted by [[T. S. Eliot]] for [[Faber and Faber]], and the same firm remained the British publisher of all the books he published thereafter. In 1930 he began five years as a schoolmaster in boys' schools: two years at the [[Larchfield Academy]] in [[Helensburgh]], Scotland, then three years at [[The Downs School (Herefordshire)|the Downs School]] in the [[Malvern Hills]], where he was a much-loved teacher.<ref name="CarpenterNoPage"/> At the Downs, in June 1933, he experienced what he later described as a "Vision of [[Agape]]", while sitting with three fellow-teachers at the school, when he suddenly found that he loved them for themselves, that their existence had infinite value for him; this experience, he said, later influenced his decision to return to the Anglican Church in 1940.<ref>{{cite book

During these years, Auden's erotic interests focused, as he later said, on an idealised "Alter Ego"<ref>{{cite book

His relationships (and his unsuccessful courtships) tended to be unequal either in age or intelligence; his sexual relations were transient, although some evolved into long friendships. He contrasted these relationships with what he later regarded as the "marriage" (his word) of equals that he began with [[Chester Kallman]] in 1939, based on the unique individuality of both partners.<ref name="EarlyNoPage">{{cite book | first=Edward |last= Mendelson | author-link = Edward Mendelson | title = Early Auden | url=https://archive.org/details/earlyauden0000mend | url-access=registration | publisher=[[Viking]] | year = 1981 | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-670-28712-3}}</ref>

In 1935 Auden married [[Erika Mann]] (1905–1969), the lesbian novelist daughter of [[Thomas Mann]] when it became apparent that the Nazis were intending to strip her of her German citizenship.<!-- Her uncle, [[Heinrich Mann]], was the first person to be stripped of German citizenship when the Nazis took office.--><ref name="Lebor">{{cite book|first1=Adam |last1=Lebor |first2=Roger |last2=Boyles|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=2000|title=Surviving Hitler, Choices, Corruption and Compromise in the Third Reich|isbn=0-684-85811-8}}</ref> Mann had asked Christopher Isherwood if he would marry her so she could become a British citizen.

From 1935 until he left Britain early in 1939, Auden worked as freelance reviewer, essayist, and lecturer, first with the [[GPO Film Unit]], a documentary film-making branch of the post office, headed by [[John Grierson]]. Through his work for the Film Unit in 1935 he met and collaborated with [[Benjamin Britten]], with whom he also worked on plays, song cycles, and a libretto.<ref>{{cite book | first=Donald |last= Mitchell | title = Britten and Auden in the Thirties: the year 1936 | publisher=Faber and Faber | year = 1981 | location = London | isbn = 978-0-571-11715-4}}</ref> Auden's plays in the 1930s were performed by the [[Group Theatre (London)|Group Theatre]], in productions that he supervised to varying degrees.<ref name="DNB"/>

His work now reflected his belief that any good artist must be "more than a bit of a reporting journalist".<ref>{{cite book| first=W.

In 1937 he went to Spain intending to drive an ambulance for the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republic]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]], but was put to work writing propaganda at the Republican press and propaganda office, where he felt useless and left after a week.<ref>The Good Comrade, Memoirs of [[Kate Mangan]] and [[Jan Kurzke]], [[International Institute of Social History]] (IISH), Amsterdam.</ref> He returned to England after a brief visit to the front at Sarineña. His seven-week visit to Spain affected him deeply, and his social views grew more complex as he found political realities to be more ambiguous and troubling than he had imagined.<ref name="EarlyNoPage"/><ref name="CarpenterNoPage"/> Again attempting to combine reportage and art, he and Isherwood spent six months in 1938 visiting China amid the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]], working on their book ''[[Journey to a War]]'' (1939). On their way back to England they stayed briefly in New York and decided to move to the United States. Auden spent late 1938 partly in England, partly in Brussels.<ref name="CarpenterNoPage"/>

Many of Auden's poems during the 1930s and after were inspired by unconsummated love, and in the 1950s he summarised his emotional life in a famous couplet: "If equal affection cannot be / Let the more loving one be me" ("The More Loving One"). He had a gift for friendship and, starting in the late 1930s, a strong wish for the stability of marriage; in a letter to his friend [[James Stern (writer)|James Stern]] he called marriage "the ''only'' subject."<ref>{{cite book| first=W.

Auden and Isherwood sailed to New York City in January 1939, entering on temporary visas. Their departure from Britain was later seen by many as a betrayal, and Auden's reputation suffered.<ref name="CarpenterNoPage"/> In April 1939, Isherwood moved to California, and he and Auden saw each other only intermittently in later years. Around this time, Auden met the poet [[Chester Kallman]], who became his lover for the next two years (Auden described their relation as a "marriage" that began with a cross-country "honeymoon" journey).<ref>{{cite book | first= Edward |last=Mendelson | author-link = Edward Mendelson | title = Later Auden

In 1940–41, Auden lived in a house at 7 Middagh Street in [[Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn|Brooklyn Heights]], that he shared with [[Carson McCullers]], Benjamin Britten, and others, which became a famous centre of artistic life, nicknamed "February House".<ref>{{cite book| first = Sherrill| last = Tippins| title = February House: The Story of W.

After Britain declared war on Germany in September 1939, Auden told the British embassy in Washington that he would return to the UK if needed. He was told that, among those his age (32), only qualified personnel were needed. In 1941–42 he taught English at the [[University of Michigan]]. He was called for the draft in the United States Army in August 1942, but was rejected on medical grounds. He had been awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] for 1942–43 but did not use it, choosing instead to teach at [[Swarthmore College]] in 1942–45.<ref name="CarpenterNoPage"/>

In mid-1945, after the end of [[World War II]] in Europe, he was in Germany with the [[Strategic Bombing Survey (Europe)|U. S. Strategic Bombing Survey]], studying the effects of Allied bombing on German morale, an experience that affected his postwar work as his visit to Spain had affected him earlier.<ref name="LaterNoPage"/> On his return, he settled in [[Manhattan]], working as a freelance writer, a lecturer at [[The New School]] for Social Research, and a visiting professor at [[Bennington College|Bennington]], [[Smith College|Smith]], and other American colleges. In 1946 he became a [[naturalised citizen]] of the US.<ref name="CarpenterNoPage"/><ref name="DNB"/>

In 1948, Auden began spending his summers in Europe, together with Chester Kallman, first in [[Ischia]], Italy, where he rented a house. Then, starting in 1958, he began spending his summers in [[Kirchstetten]], [[Austria]], where he bought a farmhouse from the prize money of the ''[[Feltrinelli Prize|Premio Feltrinelli]]'' awarded to him in 1957.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salzburg.com/nachrichten/oesterreich/kultur/sn/artikel/gedenkstaette-fuer-w-h-auden-in-kirchstetten-neu-gestaltet-164965|title=Gedenkstätte für W.

This fairly light workload allowed him to continue to spend winter in New York, where he lived at 77 [[St. Mark's Place]] in Manhattan's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]], and to spend summer in Europe, spending only three weeks each year lecturing in Oxford. He earned his income mostly from readings and lecture tours, and by writing for ''[[The New Yorker]],'' ''[[The New York Review of Books]],'' and other magazines.<ref name="DNB"/>

In 1963 Kallman left the apartment he shared in New York with Auden, and lived during the winter in Athens while continuing to spend his summers with Auden in Austria. In 1972, Auden moved his winter home from New York to Oxford, where his old college, Christ Church, offered him a cottage, while he continued to spend summers in Austria. He died in Vienna in 1973, a few hours after giving a reading of his poems at the Austrian Society for Literature; his death occurred at the Hotel Altenburger Hof where he was staying overnight before his intended return to Oxford the next day.<ref>{{cite news |first=Israel |last=Shrenker|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/09/30/archives/w-h-auden-dies-in-vienna-w-h-auden-dies-in-vienna-at-the-age-of-66.html?mcubz=1 |title=W.

Auden published about four hundred poems, including seven long poems (two of them book-length). His poetry was encyclopaedic in scope and method, ranging in style from obscure twentieth-century modernism to the lucid traditional forms such as [[ballads]] and [[Limerick (poetry)|limerick]]s, from [[doggerel]] through [[haiku]] and [[villanelles]] to a "Christmas Oratorio" and a [[baroque]] [[eclogue]] in Anglo-Saxon meters.<ref name="FullerNoPage">{{cite book

He also wrote more than four hundred essays and reviews about literature, history, politics, music, religion, and many other subjects. He collaborated on plays with [[Christopher Isherwood]] and on opera libretti with [[Chester Kallman]], and worked with a group of artists and filmmakers on documentary films in the 1930s and with the [[New York Pro Musica]] [[early music]] group in the 1950s and 1960s.

Auden controversially rewrote or discarded some of his most famous poems when he prepared his later collected editions.

===Early work, 1922–1939===
====Up to 1930====
[[File:Poems1928.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Cover of the privately printed ''[[Poems (Auden)|Poems]]'' (1928)]]

Auden began writing poems in 1922, at fifteen, mostly in the styles of 19th-century romantic poets, especially [[Wordsworth]], and later poets with rural interests, especially [[Thomas Hardy]]. At eighteen he discovered [[T. S. Eliot|T.&nbsp;S. Eliot]] and adopted an extreme version of Eliot's style. He found his own voice at twenty when he wrote the first poem later included in his collected work, "From the very first coming down".<ref name="EarlyNoPage"/> This and other poems of the late 1920s tended to be in a clipped, elusive style that alluded to, but did not directly state, their themes of loneliness and loss. Twenty of these poems appeared in his first book ''[[Poems (Auden)|Poems]]'' (1928), a pamphlet hand-printed by [[Stephen Spender]].<ref>{{cite book

In 1928 he wrote his first dramatic work, ''[[Paid on Both Sides]]'', subtitled "A Charade", which combined style and content from the Icelandic [[sagas]] with jokes from English school life. This mixture of tragedy and farce, with a dream play-within-a-play, introduced the mixed styles and content of much of his later work.<ref name="FullerNoPage"/> This drama and thirty short poems appeared in his first published book ''[[Poems (Auden)|Poems]]'' (1930, 2nd edition with seven poems replaced, 1933); the poems in the book were mostly lyrical and gnomic meditations on hoped-for or unconsummated love and on themes of personal, social, and seasonal renewal; among these poems were "It was Easter as I walked," "Doom is dark," "Sir, no man's enemy," and "This lunar beauty."<ref name="EarlyNoPage"/>

A recurrent theme in these early poems is the effect of "family ghosts", Auden's term for the powerful, unseen psychological effects of preceding generations on any individual life (and the title of a poem). A parallel theme, present throughout his work, is the contrast between biological evolution (unchosen and involuntary) and the psychological evolution of cultures and individuals (voluntary and deliberate even in its subconscious aspects).<ref name="FullerNoPage"/><ref name="EarlyNoPage"/>

====1931–1935====
[[File:DanceOfDeathProgramme.jpg|thumb|Programme of a Group Theatre production of ''[[The Dance of Death (Auden)|The Dance of Death]]'', with unsigned synopsis by Auden]]

Auden's next large-scale work was ''[[The Orators]]: An English Study'' (1932; revised editions, 1934, 1966), in verse and prose, largely about hero-worship in personal and political life. In his shorter poems, his style became more open and accessible, and the exuberant "Six Odes" in ''The Orators'' reflect his new interest in [[Robert Burns]].<ref name="FullerNoPage"/> During the next few years, many of his poems took their form and style from traditional ballads and popular songs, and also from expansive classical forms like the ''[[Odes (Horace)|Odes]]'' of [[Horace]], which he seems to have discovered through the German poet [[Hölderlin]].<ref name="EarlyNoPage"/> Around this time his main influences were [[Dante]], [[William Langland]], and [[Alexander Pope]].<ref>{{cite book

During these years, much of his work expressed left-wing views, and he became widely known as a political poet although he was privately more ambivalent about revolutionary politics than many reviewers recognised,<ref>Carpenter, pp. 256–257.</ref> and Mendelson argues that he expounded political views partly out of a sense of moral duty and partly because it enhanced his reputation, and that he later regretted having done so.<ref>[[Edward Mendelson|Mendelson]], ''Early Auden'', pp. 257–303.</ref> He generally wrote about revolutionary change in terms of a "change of heart", a transformation of a society from a closed-off psychology of fear to an open psychology of love.<ref name="RDH-NoPage"/>

His verse drama ''[[The Dance of Death (Auden)|The Dance of Death]]'' (1933) was a political extravaganza in the style of a theatrical revue, which Auden later called "a nihilistic leg-pull."<ref>{{cite book

}}</ref> His next play ''[[The Dog Beneath the Skin]]'' (1935), written in collaboration with Isherwood, was similarly a quasi-Marxist updating of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] in which the general idea of social transformation was more prominent than any specific political action or structure.<ref name="FullerNoPage"/><ref name="EarlyNoPage"/>

''[[The Ascent of F6]]'' (1937), another play written with Isherwood, was partly an anti-imperialist satire, partly (in the character of the self-destroying climber Michael Ransom) an examination of Auden's own motives in taking on a public role as a political poet.<ref name="EarlyNoPage"/> This play included the first version of "[[Funeral Blues]]" ("Stop all the clocks"), written as a satiric eulogy for a politician; Auden later rewrote the poem as a "Cabaret Song" about lost love (written to be sung by the soprano [[Hedli Anderson]], for whom he wrote many lyrics in the 1930s).<ref name="Plays"/> In 1935, he worked briefly on documentary films with the [[GPO Film Unit]], writing his famous verse commentary for ''[[Night Mail]]'' and lyrics for other films that were among his attempts in the 1930s to create a widely accessible, socially conscious art.<ref name="FullerNoPage"/><ref name="EarlyNoPage"/><ref name="Plays"/>

====1936–1939====
In 1936 Auden's publisher chose the title ''Look, Stranger!'' for a collection of political odes, love poems, comic songs, meditative lyrics, and a variety of intellectually intense but emotionally accessible verse; Auden hated the title and retitled the collection for the 1937 US edition ''[[On This Island]]''.<ref name="EarlyNoPage"/> Among the poems included in the book are "Hearing of harvests", "Out on the lawn I lie in bed", "O what is that sound", "Look, stranger, on this island now" (later revised versions change "on" to "at"), and "Our hunting fathers".<ref name="FullerNoPage"/><ref name="EarlyNoPage"/>

Auden was now arguing that an artist should be a kind of journalist, and he put this view into practice in ''[[Letters from Iceland]]'' (1937) a travel book in prose and verse written with [[Louis MacNeice]], which included his long social, literary, and autobiographical commentary "Letter to Lord Byron".<ref name="ProseOne"/> In 1937, after observing the [[Spanish Civil War]] he wrote a politically engaged pamphlet poem ''[[Spain (Auden)|Spain]]'' (1937); he later discarded it from his collected works. ''[[Journey to a War]]'' (1939) a travel book in prose and verse, was written with Isherwood after their visit to the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]].<ref name="ProseOne"/> Auden's last collaboration with Isherwood was their third play, ''[[On the Frontier]]'', an anti-war satire written in Broadway and West End styles.<ref name="EarlyNoPage"/><ref name="DNB"/>

Auden's shorter poems now engaged with the fragility and transience of personal love ("Danse Macabre", "The Dream", "Lay your sleeping head"), a subject he treated with ironic wit in his "Four Cabaret Songs for Miss [[Hedli Anderson]]" (which included "Tell Me the Truth About Love" and the revised version of "[[Funeral Blues]]"), and also the corrupting effect of public and official culture on individual lives ("Casino", "School Children", "Dover").<ref name="FullerNoPage"/><ref name="EarlyNoPage"/> In 1938 he wrote a series of dark, ironic ballads about individual failure ("Miss Gee", "James Honeyman", "Victor"). All these appeared in ''[[Another Time (book)|Another Time]]'' (1940), together with poems including "Dover", "As He Is", and "[[Musée des Beaux Arts (poem)|Musée des Beaux Arts]]" (all of which were written before he moved to America in 1939), and "In Memory of W. B. Yeats", "[[The Unknown Citizen]]", "Law Like Love", "September 1, 1939", and "In Memory of Sigmund Freud" (all written in America).<ref name="FullerNoPage"/>

The elegies for Yeats and Freud are partly anti-heroic statements, in which great deeds are performed, not by unique geniuses whom others cannot hope to imitate, but by otherwise ordinary individuals who were "silly like us" (Yeats) or of whom it could be said "he wasn't clever at all" (Freud), and who became teachers of others, not awe-inspiring heroes.<ref name="EarlyNoPage"/>

===Middle period, 1940–1957===
====1940–1946====
In 1940 Auden wrote a long philosophical poem "New Year Letter", which appeared with miscellaneous notes and other poems in ''[[The Double Man (book)|The Double Man]]'' (1941). At the time of his return to the Anglican Communion he began writing abstract verse on theological themes, such as "Canzone" and "Kairos and Logos". Around 1942, as he became more comfortable with religious themes, his verse became more open and relaxed, and he increasingly used the [[syllabic verse]] he had learned from the poetry of [[Marianne Moore]].<ref name="LaterNoPage"/>

Auden's work in this era addresses the artist's temptation to use other persons as material for his art rather than valuing them for themselves ("Prospero to Ariel") and the corresponding moral obligation to make and keep commitments while recognising the temptation to break them ("In Sickness and Health").<ref name="LaterNoPage"/><ref name="FullerNoPage"/> From 1942 through 1947 he worked mostly on three long poems in dramatic form, each differing from the others in form and content: "[[For the Time Being]]: A Christmas Oratorio", "[[The Sea and the Mirror|The Sea and the Mirror: A Commentary on Shakespeare's ''The Tempest'']]" (both published in ''For the Time Being'', 1944), and ''[[The Age of Anxiety]]: A Baroque Eclogue'' (published separately in 1947).<ref name="LaterNoPage"/> The first two, with Auden's other new poems from 1940 to 1944, were included in his first collected edition, ''The Collected Poetry of W.&nbsp;H. Auden'' (1945), with most of his earlier poems, many in revised versions.<ref name="FullerNoPage"/>

====1947–1957====
[[File:W. H. Auden (1956 press photo).jpg|thumb|upright|Auden in 1956]]
After completing ''The Age of Anxiety'' in 1946 he focused again on shorter poems, notably "A Walk After Dark", "The Love Feast", and "The Fall of Rome".<ref name="LaterNoPage"/> Many of these evoked the Italian village where he spent his summers between 1948 and 1957, and his next book, ''[[Nones (Auden)|Nones]]'' (1951), had a Mediterranean atmosphere new to his work.<ref name="Tony Sharpe 196">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U1QgAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA196|page=196|title=W.

While writing this, he also wrote "[[Bucolics (Auden)|Bucolics]]," a sequence of seven poems about man's relation to nature. Both sequences appeared in his next book, ''[[The Shield of Achilles]]'' (1955), with other short poems, including the book's title poem, "Fleet Visit", and "Epitaph for the Unknown Soldier".<ref name="FullerNoPage"/><ref name="LaterNoPage"/>

In 1955–56 Auden wrote a group of poems about "history", the term he used to mean the set of unique events made by human choices, as opposed to "nature", the set of involuntary events created by natural processes, statistics, and anonymous forces such as crowds. These poems included "T the Great", "The Maker", and the title poem of his next collection ''[[Homage to Clio]]'' (1960).<ref name="FullerNoPage"/><ref name="LaterNoPage"/>

===Later work, 1958–1973===
[[File:Auden1970ByPeter.jpg|thumb|left|Auden in 1970]]

In the late 1950s Auden's style became less rhetorical while its range of styles increased. In 1958, having moved his summer home from Italy to Austria, he wrote "Good-bye to the Mezzogiorno"; other poems from this period include "Dichtung und Wahrheit: An Unwritten Poem", a prose poem about the relation between love and personal and poetic language, and the contrasting "Dame Kind", about the anonymous impersonal reproductive instinct. These and other poems, including his 1955–66 poems about history, appeared in ''[[Homage to Clio]]'' (1960).<ref name="FullerNoPage"/><ref name="LaterNoPage"/> His prose book ''[[The Dyer's Hand]]'' (1962) gathered many of the lectures he gave in Oxford as Professor of Poetry in 1956–61, together with revised versions of essays and notes written since the mid-1940s.<ref name="LaterNoPage"/>

Among the new styles and forms in Auden's later work were the [[haiku]] and [[tanka]] that he began writing after translating the haiku and other verse in [[Dag Hammarskjöld]]'s ''Markings''.<ref name="LaterNoPage"/> A sequence of fifteen poems about his house in Austria, "Thanksgiving for a Habitat" (written in various styles that included an imitation of [[William Carlos Williams]]) appeared in ''[[About the House]]'' (1965), together with other poems that included his reflection on his lecture tours, "On the Circuit".<ref name="FullerNoPage"/> In the late 1960s he wrote some of his most vigorous poems, including "River Profile" and two poems that looked back over his life, "Prologue at Sixty" and "Forty Years On". All these appeared in ''[[City Without Walls]]'' (1969). His lifelong passion for Icelandic legend culminated in his verse translation of ''The [[Elder Edda]]'' (1969).<ref name="FullerNoPage"/><ref name="LaterNoPage"/> Among his later themes was the "religionless Christianity" he learned partly from [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]], the dedicatee of his poem "Friday's Child."<ref>{{cite book

===Reputation and influence===
Auden's stature in modern literature has been contested. Probably the most common critical view from the 1930s onward ranked him as the last and least of the three major twentieth-century British and Irish poets—behind Yeats and Eliot—while a minority view, more prominent in recent years, ranks him as the highest of the three.<ref name="SmithIntro">{{cite book | last = Smith | first = Stan | year = 2004 | chapter = Introduction | title = The Cambridge Companion to W.

Critical estimates were divided from the start. Reviewing Auden's first book, ''Poems'' (1930), [[Naomi Mitchison]] wrote "If this is really only the beginning, we have perhaps a master to look forward to."<ref>Haffenden, p. 83.</ref> But [[John Hanbury Angus Sparrow|John Sparrow]], recalling Mitchison's comment in 1934, dismissed Auden's early work as "a monument to the misguided aims that prevail among contemporary poets, and the fact that… he is being hailed as 'a master' shows how criticism is helping poetry on the downward path."<ref>Haffenden, pp. 7–8.</ref>

Auden's clipped, satiric, and ironic style in the 1930s was widely imitated by younger poets such as [[Charles Madge]], who wrote in a poem "there waited for me in the summer morning / Auden fiercely. I read, shuddered, and knew."<ref>Smith, ''Companion'', p. 123.</ref> He was widely described as the leader of an "Auden group" that comprised his friends [[Stephen Spender]], [[Cecil Day-Lewis]], and [[Louis MacNeice]].<ref name="Hynes">{{cite book | last = Hynes | first = Samuel | year = 1977 | title = The Auden Generation | publisher = Viking | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-712-65250-6 | url = https://archive.org/details/audengenerationl00hyne }}</ref> The four were mocked by the poet [[Roy Campbell (poet)|Roy Campbell]] as if they were a single undifferentiated poet named "Macspaunday."<ref>Haffenden, p. 34.</ref> Auden's propagandistic poetic plays, including ''The Dog Beneath the Skin'' and ''The Ascent of F6'', and his political poems such as "Spain" gave him the reputation as a political poet writing in a progressive and accessible voice, in contrast to Eliot; but this political stance provoked opposing opinions, such as that of [[Austin Clarke (poet)|Austin Clarke]] who called Auden's work "liberal, democratic, and humane",<ref>Haffenden, p. 29.</ref> and John Drummond, who wrote that Auden misused a "characteristic and popularizing trick, the generalized image", to present ostensibly left-wing views that were in fact "confined to bourgeois experience."<ref>Haffenden, p. 31.</ref>
 
Auden's departure for America in 1939 was debated in Britain (once even in Parliament), with some seeing his emigration as a betrayal. Defenders of Auden such as [[Geoffrey Grigson]], in an introduction to a 1949 anthology of modern poetry, wrote that Auden "arches over all". His stature was suggested by book titles such as ''Auden and After'' by [[Francis Scarfe]] (1942) and ''The Auden Generation'' by [[Samuel Hynes]] (1977).<ref name="Companion"/>

In the US, starting in the late 1930s, the detached, ironic tone of Auden's regular stanzas became influential; [[John Ashbery]] recalled that in the 1940s Auden "was ''the'' modern poet".<ref name="SansomChapter"/> Auden's formal influences were so pervasive in American poetry that the ecstatic style of the [[Beat Generation]] was partly a reaction against his influence. From the 1940s through the 1960s, many critics lamented that Auden's work had declined from its earlier promise; [[Randall Jarrell]] wrote a series of essays making a case against Auden's later work,<ref>{{cite book | last = Jarrell | first = Randall | editor-last = Burt | editor-first = Stephen | year = 2005 | title = Randall Jarrell on W. H. Auden | publisher = Columbia University Press | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-231-13078-3 | url = https://archive.org/details/randalljarrellon00jarr }}</ref> and [[Philip Larkin]]'s "What's Become of Wystan?" (1960) had a wide impact.<ref name="SansomChapter" /><ref>Haffenden, pp. 414–19.</ref>

After his death, some of his poems, notably "[[Funeral Blues]]", "[[Musée des Beaux Arts (poem)|Musée des Beaux Arts]]", "[[Refugee Blues]]", "[[The Unknown Citizen]]", and "September 1, 1939", became known to a much wider public than during his lifetime through films, broadcasts, and popular media.<ref name="Companion"/>

The first full-length study of Auden was [[Richard Hoggart]]'s ''Auden: An Introductory Essay'' (1951), which concluded that "Auden's work, then, is a civilising force."<ref>{{cite book | last = Hoggart | first = Richard | year = 1951 | title = Auden: An Introductory Essay | url = https://archive.org/details/audenintroductor0000hogg | url-access = registration | publisher = Chatto & Windus | location = London | page = [https://archive.org/details/audenintroductor0000hogg/page/219 219]}}</ref> It was followed by [[Joseph Warren Beach]]'s ''The Making of the Auden Canon'' (1957), a disapproving account of Auden's revisions of his earlier work.

Spears' ''The Poetry of W.&nbsp;H. Auden: The Disenchanted Island'' (1963), "written out of the conviction that Auden's poetry can offer the reader entertainment, instruction, intellectual excitement, and a prodigal variety of aesthetic pleasures, all in a generous abundance that is unique in our time."<ref>{{cite book | last = Spears | first = Monroe K. | year = 1963 | title = The Poetry of W.H.

Auden was one of three candidates recommended by the Nobel Committee to the Swedish Academy for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1963<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/literature/1963.html | title=Candidates for the 1963 Nobel Prize in Literature | publisher=Nobel Prize |date=2013 |access-date=3 January 2014}}</ref> and 1965<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/literature/1965.html | title=Candidates for the 1965 Nobel Prize in Literature | publisher=Nobel Prize | date=2014 | access-date=4 December 2016}}</ref> and six recommended for the 1964 prize.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/literature/1964.html |title=Candidates for the 1964 Nobel Prize in Literature |publisher=Nobel Prize |date=2015 |access-date= 25 May 2015}}</ref> By the time of his death in 1973 he had attained the status of a respected elder statesman, and a memorial stone for him was placed in [[Poets' Corner]] in [[Westminster Abbey]] in 1974.<ref>{{cite web |title = Famous People & the Abbey: Wystan Hugh Auden |url = https://www.westminster-abbey.org/abbey-commemorations/commemorations/wystan-hugh-auden/#i13475 |access-date = 28 July 2018 |df = dmy-all}}</ref> The [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] writes that "by the time of Eliot's death in 1965… a convincing case could be made for the assertion that Auden was indeed Eliot's successor, as Eliot had inherited sole claim to supremacy when [[William Butler Yeats|Yeats]] died in 1939."<ref>{{cite web | website=britannica.com| title = W.H.

Auden in Context'', pp. 118–37.</ref>

Another group of critics and poets has maintained that unlike other modern poets, Auden's reputation did not decline after his death, and the influence of his later writing was especially strong on younger American poets including [[John Ashbery]], [[James Merrill]], [[Anthony Hecht]], and [[Maxine Kumin]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Wasley | first = Aidan | title = The Age of Auden: Postwar Poetry and the American Scene | year = 2011 | publisher = Princeton University Press | location = Princeton | isbn = 978-1-40083635-2}}</ref> Typical later evaluations describe him as "arguably the [20th] century's greatest poet" (Peter Parker and Frank Kermode),<ref>{{cite book | editor-last = Kermode | editor-first = Frank | title = The Reader's Companion to Twentieth-Century Writers | year = 1995 | publisher = Fourth Estate | location = London | page = 35 | isbn = 978-1-85702332-9}}</ref> who "now clearly seems the greatest poet in English since Tennyson" (Philip Hensher).<ref>{{cite news

Public recognition of Auden's work sharply increased after his "Funeral Blues" ("Stop all the clocks") was read aloud in the film ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'' (1994); subsequently, a pamphlet edition of ten of his poems, ''Tell Me the Truth About Love'', sold more than 275,000 copies. An excerpt from his poem "As I walked out one evening" was recited in the film ''[[Before Sunrise]]'' (1995).<ref>{{cite web | url = https://ew.com/article/1995/02/03/wh-audens-hollywood-career/ | title = W.H.

After 11 September 2001 his 1939 poem "September 1, 1939" was widely circulated and frequently broadcast.<ref name="SansomChapter"/> Public readings and broadcast tributes in the UK and US in 2007 marked his centenary year.<ref>{{cite web | author = The W. H. Auden Society | url = http://audensociety.org/news.html | title = The Auden Centenary 2007 | access-date = 20 January 2007}}</ref>

Overall, Auden's poetry was noted for its stylistic and technical achievement, its engagement with politics, morals, love, and religion, and its variety in tone, form and content.<ref name="PoetsOrg">{{cite web | url = http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/120 | publisher = [[Academy of American Poets]] | title = W.H.
