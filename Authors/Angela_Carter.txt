{{More citations needed section|date=May 2013}}
Born Angela Olive Stalker in [[Eastbourne]], in 1940, to Sophia Olive (née Farthing; 1905–1969), a cashier at [[Selfridge's]], and journalist Hugh Alexander Stalker (1896–1988),<ref>{{Cite ODNB | url=https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-50941 |doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/50941|title = The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|year = 2004}}</ref> Carter was evacuated as a child to live in Yorkshire with her maternal grandmother.<ref>http://www.angelacartersite.co.uk/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180307101014/http://angelacartersite.co.uk/ |date=7 March 2018 }} Retrieved 5 November 2015.</ref> After attending [[Streatham and Clapham High School]], in south London, she began work as a journalist on ''[[The Croydon Advertiser]]'',<ref name="telegraph.co.uk">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/5899665/Angela-Carter.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100222000505/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/5899665/Angela-Carter.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=22 February 2010|title=Angela Carter|date=17 February 1992|access-date=18 May 2018|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref> following in her father's footsteps.

She married twice, first in 1960 to Paul Carter,<ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/> divorcing in 1972. In 1969, she used the proceeds of her [[Somerset Maugham Award]] to leave her husband and relocate for two years to Tokyo, where she claims in ''Nothing Sacred'' (1982) that she "learnt what it is to be a woman and became radicalised".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/22/the-invention-of-angela-carter-a-biography-by-edmund-gordon-review|title=The Invention of Angela Carter: A Biography by Edmund Gordon – review|last=Hill|first=Rosemary|date=22 October 2016|work=The Guardian|access-date=29 September 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> She wrote about her experiences there in articles for ''[[New Society]]'' and a collection of short stories, ''[[Fireworks: Nine Profane Pieces]]'' (1974), and evidence of her experiences in Japan can also be seen in ''[[The Infernal Desire Machines of Doctor Hoffman]]'' (1972).

She then explored the United States, Asia and Europe, helped by her fluency in French and German. She spent much of the late 1970s and 1980s as a writer in residence at universities, including the [[University of Sheffield]], [[Brown University]], the [[University of Adelaide]], and the [[University of East Anglia]]. In 1977, Carter met Mark Pearce, with whom she had one son and whom she married shortly before her death.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/01/angela-carter-far-from-fairytale-edmund-gordon|title=Angela Carter: Far from the fairytale|first=Edmund|last=Gordon|date=1 October 2016|access-date=13 May 2019|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> In 1979, both ''[[The Bloody Chamber]]'', and her feminist essay, ''[[The Sadeian Woman and the Ideology of Pornography]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/feb/16/from-fifty-shades-to-buffy-what-we-owe-to-angela-carter|work=The Guardian|title=Angela's influence: what we owe to Carter|author=John Dugdale|date= 16 February 2017}}</ref> appeared. In the essay, according to the writer [[Marina Warner]], Carter "deconstructs the arguments that underlie ''The Bloody Chamber''. It's about desire and its destruction, the self-immolation of women, how women collude and connive with their condition of enslavement. She was much more independent-minded than the traditional feminist of her time."<ref>Marina Warner, speaking on Radio Three's ''the Verb'', February 2012</ref>

As well as being a prolific writer of fiction, Carter contributed many articles to ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[The Independent]]'' and ''[[New Statesman]]'', collected in ''Shaking a Leg''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/book-of-a-lifetime-shaking-a-leg-by-angela-carter-6699565.html|title=Book of a Lifetime: Shaking a Leg, By Angela Carter|date=10 February 2012|work=The Independent|access-date=29 September 2017|language=en-GB}}</ref> She adapted a number of her short stories for radio and wrote two original radio dramas on [[Richard Dadd]] and [[Ronald Firbank]].

These neglected works, as well as her controversial television documentary, ''[[The Holy Family Album]]'', are discussed in Charlotte Crofts' book, ''[[Anagrams of Desire]]'' (2003). Her novel ''[[Nights at the Circus]]'' won the 1984 [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for literature. Her last novel, ''[[Wise Children]]'', is a surreal wild ride through British theatre and music hall traditions.

Carter died aged 51 in 1992 at her home in London after developing [[lung cancer]].<ref name="guardian-20091003">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/oct/03/sarah-waters-angela-carter |title=My hero: Angela Carter |author=Sarah Waters |newspaper=The Guardian |date=3 October 2009 |access-date=24 June 2014}}</ref><ref>Michael Dirda, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/the-unconventional-life-of-angela-carter--prolific-author-reluctant-feminist/2017/03/07/e32ab7e4-ff86-11e6-8f41-ea6ed597e4ca_story.html "The Unconventional Life of Angela Carter - prolific author, reluctant feminist,"] ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 8 March 2017.</ref> At the time of her death, she had started work on a sequel to [[Charlotte Brontë]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' based on the later life of Jane's stepdaughter, Adèle Varens; only a synopsis survives.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2006/jan/29/theatre.angelacarter?gusrc=rss&feed=books | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=The greatest swinger in town | first=Susannah | last=Clapp | date=29 January 2006 | access-date=25 April 2010}}</ref>
