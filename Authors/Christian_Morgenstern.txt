'''Christian Otto Josef Wolfgang Morgenstern''' (6 May 1871 &ndash; 31 March 1914) was a [[Germany|German]] [[author]] and [[poet]] from [[Munich]].<ref name="Wachsmuth1955">{{cite book|author=Guenther Wachsmuth|title=The Life and Work of Rudolf Steiner from the Turn of the Century to His Death|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mWrYAAAAMAAJ|year=1955|publisher=Whittier Books|isbn=978-0-89345-249-0|page=221}}</ref>  Morgenstern married Margareta Gosebruch von Liechtenstern on 7 March 1910.  He worked for a while as a journalist in Berlin, but spent much of his life traveling through Germany, Switzerland, and Italy, primarily in a vain attempt to recover his health.  His travels, though they failed to restore him to health, allowed him to meet many of the foremost literary and philosophical figures of his time in central Europe.

Morgenstern's [[poetry]], much of which was inspired by English [[literary nonsense]], is immensely popular, even though he enjoyed very little success during his lifetime. He made fun of scholasticism, e.g. literary criticism in "Drei Hasen", grammar in "Der Werwolf", narrow-mindedness in "Der Gaul", and symbolism in "Der Wasseresel".  In "Scholastikerprobleme" he discussed [[how many angels could sit on a needle]].  Still many Germans know some of his poems and quotations by heart, e.g. the following line from "The Impossible Fact" ("Die unmögliche Tatsache", 1910):

:''Weil, so schließt er messerscharf / Nicht sein kann, was nicht sein darf.''
:"For, he reasons pointedly / That which must not, can not be."

Embedded in his humorous poetry is a subtle metaphysical streak, as e.g. in "Vice Versa", (1905):

{{col-break|gap=1em}}
''Ein Hase sitzt auf einer Wiese,'' <br/>
''des Glaubens, niemand sähe diese.'' <br/>
''Doch im Besitze eines Zeißes'' <br/>
''betrachtet voll gehaltnen Fleißes'' <br/>
''vom vis-à-vis gelegnen Berg'' <br/>
''ein Mensch den kleinen Löffelzwerg.'' <br/>
''Ihn aber blickt hinwiederum'' <br/>
''ein Gott von fern an, mild und stumm.''
{{col-break|gap=2em}}
"A rabbit in his meadow lair <br/>
Imagines none to see him there. <br/>
But aided by a looking lens <br/>
A man with eager diligence <br/>
Inspects the tiny long-eared gnome <br/>
From a convenient near-by dome. <br/>
Yet him surveys, or so we learn <br/>
A god from far off, mild and stern."

[[Gerolf Steiner]]'s mock-scientific book about the fictitious animal order [[Rhinogradentia]] (1961), inspired by Morgenstern's nonsense poem [[The Nasobame|''Das Nasobēm'']], is testament to his enduring popularity.

Morgenstern was a member of the [[General Anthroposophical Society]]. [[Rudolf Steiner|Dr. Rudolf Steiner]] called him 'a true representative of Anthroposophy'.

Morgenstern died in 1914 of [[tuberculosis]], which he had contracted from his mother, who died in 1881.

==Gallows Songs==
Morgenstern's best known works are the ''[[Galgenlieder]]'' (Gallows Songs, 1905). This volume of humorous verses was followed by ''Palmström'' in 1910. Published posthumously were the important companion volumes ''Palma Kunkel'' in 1916, ''Der Gingganz'' in 1919, and ''Alle Galgenlieder'' in 1932. In German these works have gone through dozens of different editions and reprints and sold hundreds of thousands of copies.

==Morgenstern as translator==
Christian Morgenstern was also an acclaimed translator, rendering into German various prominent works from Norwegian and French, including the dramas and poems of [[Henrik Ibsen]], [[Knut Hamsun]], [[Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson]] and [[August Strindberg]].

==Musical settings==
Morgenstern's poems have been set to music by composers such as [[Erik Bergman]] (four Galgenlieder, ''Das große Lalula'', ''Tapetenblume'', ''Igel und Agel'', ''Unter Zeiten''), [[Hanns Eisler]], [[Sofia Gubaidulina]], [[Paul Graener]], [[Friedrich Gulda]], [[Paul Hindemith]], [[Robert Kahn (composer)|Robert Kahn]], [[Yrjö Kilpinen]], [[Margarete Schweikert]], Matyas Seiber (''Two Madrigals'' and ''Three Morgenstern Lieder'' for soprano and clarinet), [[Rudi Spring]] (''Galgenliederbuch nach Gedichten von Christian Morgenstern'' op. 19), [[Siegfried Strohbach]] (''5 Galgenlieder''),  [[Graham Waterhouse]] (''Gruselett, Der Werwolf''), [[Timothy Hoekman]] ("Der Werwolf" in Drei Legenden) and [[Alexander von Zemlinsky]] (''Es waren zwei Kinder'', ''Vöglein Schwermut'', ''Der Abend'', ''Abendkelch voll Sonnenlicht'', ''Du gabst mir deine Kette'' and ''Auf dem Meere meiner Seele'').

== Essays, reviews and aphorisms==
In his early years Christian Morgenstern wrote a considerable number of essays and reviews for various German periodicals. They have been collected together and published in Volume 6 (Kritische Schriften, 1987) of the German collected works of Morgenstern. His philosophical and mythical works were largely influenced by the philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], the Austrian educationalist [[Rudolf Steiner]] (the originator of [[anthroposophy]] and the [[Waldorf school]] movement), and the Russian writers [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]].

Perhaps Morgenstern's most philosophical volume is a collection of aphorisms published posthumously in 1918 entitled ''Stufen: Eine Entwickelung in Aphorismen und Tagebuch-Notizen '' (Stages: A Development in Aphorisms and Diary Notes). It has given rise to a number of celebrated quotations. These include:
* "Home isn't where our house is, but wherever we are understood."
* "I shall excavate the strata of my soul."
* "I'm a man of limits: forever physically, emotionally, morally and artistically on the brink of plunging into the abyss. Yet I manage to keep my balance and possess presence of mind."
* "I bear no treasures within me. I only possess the power to transform much of what I touch into something of value. I have no depths, save my incessant desire for the depths." (Translated by David W. Wood)
