== Career ==

=== Writing ===
In the American publishing field, Windling has been one of the primary creative forces behind the [[mythic fiction]] resurgence that began in the early 1980s, through her work as an innovative editor for the [[Ace Books|Ace]] and [[Tor Books]] fantasy lines and as the editor of more than thirty anthologies of magical fiction. She created the Fairy Tale Series<ref name=FTSeries>{{isfdb series|40|The Fairy Tale Series}}. Retrieved 2020-03-15.</ref> of novels that reinterpret classic [[fairy tale]]s. She is also recognized as one of the founders of [[urban fantasy]], having published and promoted the first novels of [[Charles de Lint]], [[Emma Bull]], and other pioneers of the genre.<ref name="Clute">{{cite book|last=Clute|first=John|author2=John Grant |title=The Encyclopedia of Fantasy|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|year=1999|edition=2nd |isbn=0-312-19869-8}}, pp. 148, 237, 333.</ref><ref name="Keller">{{cite web|url=http://bestoflegends.org/fairy/woods.html|title=Into the Woods: The Faery Worlds of Terri Windling|last=Keller|first=Donald G.|year=1998|access-date=17 January 2010}}</ref>

With [[Ellen Datlow]], Windling edited 16 volumes of ''[[Year's Best Fantasy and Horror]]'' (1986–2003), an anthology that reached beyond the boundaries of [[genre]] [[fantasy]] to incorporate [[magic realism]], surrealism, poetry, and other forms of magical literature. Datlow and Windling also edited the ''[[Snow White, Blood Red (book)|Snow White, Blood Red]]'' series of literary fairy tales for adult readers, as well as many anthologies of myth & fairy tale inspired fiction for younger readers, such as ''[[The Green Man: Tales from the Mythic Forest|The Green Man]]'', ''The Faery Reel'', and ''The Wolf at the Door''. Windling also created and edited the ''[[The Borderland Series|Borderland]]'' series for teenage readers, and ''The Armless Maiden'', a fiction collection for adult survivors of [[child abuse]] like herself.<ref name="Clute b">Clute (1995), p. 251.</ref><ref name="Armless Maiden">{{cite book|last=Windling|first=Terri|title=The Armless Maiden: And Other Tales for Childhood's Survivors |publisher=[[Tor Books]]|year=1995|isbn= 0-312-85234-7 }}</ref>
