'''Adam Asnyk''' (11 September 1838 – 2 August 1897), was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[poet]] and [[dramatist]] of the [[Positivism in Poland|Positivist era]]. Born in [[Kalisz]] to a [[szlachta]] family, he was educated to become an heir of his family's estate. As such he received education at the Institute of Agriculture and Forestry in [[Marymont]] and then the Medical Surgeon School in [[Warsaw]]. He continued his studies abroad in [[Wrocław|Breslau]], [[Paris]] and [[Heidelberg]]. In 1862 he returned to [[Congress Poland]] and took part in the [[January Uprising]] against Russian rule. Because of that he had to flee his country and settled in Heidelberg, where in 1866 he received a doctorate of philosophy. Soon afterwards he returned to Poland and settled in the Austrian-held part of the country, initially in [[Lwów]] and then in [[Kraków]].

In 1875 Asnyk married Zofia [[née]] Kaczorowska, with whom he had a son, Włodzimierz, and around that time started his career as a journalist. An editor of a Kraków-based ''Reforma'' daily, in 1884 he was also chosen to the [[Local government in Kraków|city council of Kraków]]. Five years later he was elected to the [[Diet of Galicia and Lodomeria]].

Around that time he became one of the most prominent men of culture in [[partitioned Poland]]. Among his initiatives was the creation of the Society of Popular Schools and bringing the ashes of [[Adam Mickiewicz]] to Poland. He was also among the first members of the Tatra Society. He died on 2 August 1897 in Kraków and was buried at the [[Skałka]] church, a burial place for some of the most distinguished Poles, particularly those who lived in Kraków.

==Mastery of Verse==
Adam Asnyk was a master of verse. Some of his poems, for example ''Ulewa'' (''The Heavy Rain'') or ''Daremne żale'' (''The Vain regrets''), are among the best examples of [[iamb (poetry)|iambic metre]] in all of Polish literature. He also used sophisticated strophes, for instance [[ottava rima]]. The poem ''Wśród przełomu''<ref>[https://pl.wikisource.org/wiki/Poezye_T._1_(Adam_Asnyk)/W%C5%9Br%C3%B3d_prze%C5%82omu Original Text]</ref> (''At the breakthrough'') is perhaps the first use of [[rhyme royal]] in original Polish poetry. His versification was often discussed by prominent Polish scholars, among others by [[Maria Dłuska]] and [[Lucylla Pszczołowska]].<ref>See also: Wiktor Jarosław Darasz, ''Mały przewodnik po wierszu polskim'', Kraków 2003 (in Polish).</ref>
