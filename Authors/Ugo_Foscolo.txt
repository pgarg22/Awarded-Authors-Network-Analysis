'''Ugo Foscolo''' ({{IPA-it|ˈuːɡo ˈfoskolo, fɔs-|lang}};<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dipionline.it/dizionario/ricerca?lemma=Foscolo|title=Foscolo|work=DiPI Online|author=[[Luciano Canepari]]|access-date=13 January 2021|language=it}}</ref> 6 February 1778{{snd}}10 September 1827), born '''Niccolò Foscolo''', was an Italian writer, revolutionary and a poet.<ref>[http://www.inftube.com/letteratura/FOSCOLO12756.php Biography at Infotube]</ref>

He is especially remembered for his 1807 long poem ''[[Dei Sepolcri]]''.

==Early life==
Foscolo was born in [[Zakynthos]] in the [[Ionian Islands]]. His father Andrea Foscolo was an impoverished [[Venice|Venetian]] nobleman, and his mother Diamantina Spathis was [[Greeks|Greek]].<ref>''Ugo Foscolo: An Italian in Regency England'', Vincent, Eric Reginald Pearce, 1894, Cambridge University Press, pg. 106</ref><ref>''The Chronicles of Fleetwood House'', Adam John Shirren, 1977 Pacesetter Press, pg. 155</ref><ref>Introduction to Italian Poetry, Rebay, Luciano, Courier Dover Publications, pg. 97</ref><ref>Dictionary of Italian Literature, Bondanella, Julia Conaway, Peter E. Bondanella, Greenwood Press, pg. 215, {{ISBN|0-313-20421-7}}</ref><ref>''The Australian Library Journal'', 1951 Library Association of Australia, University of Michigan, pg. 179</ref>

In 1788, upon the death of his father, who worked as a physician in [[Split, Croatia|Spalato]] (present-day [[Split, Croatia]]), the family moved to [[Venice]], and Foscolo completed the studies he began at the [[Dalmatia]]n grammar school at the [[University of Padua]].<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|wstitle=Foscolo, Ugo |volume=27 |pages=730–731 |inline=1 |first=James Montgomery |last=Stuart}}</ref>

Amongst his Paduan teachers was the Abbé [[Melchiore Cesarotti]], whose version of ''[[Ossian]]'' was very popular in Italy, and who influenced Foscolo's literary tastes; he knew both [[Greek language|modern]] and [[Ancient Greek]]. His literary ambition revealed itself in the appearance in 1797 of his tragedy ''Tieste''—a production that enjoyed a certain degree of success.<ref name=EB1911/>

==Politics and poetry==
Foscolo, who, for unknown reasons, had changed his Christian name Niccolò to that of Ugo, now began to take an active part in the stormy political discussions which the [[Republic of Venice#Fall|fall of the republic of Venice]] had triggered off. He was a prominent member of the national committees, and addressed an ode to [[Napoleon]], expecting Napoleon to overthrow the Venetian [[oligarchy]] and create a free republic.<ref name=EB1911/>

The [[Treaty of Campo Formio]] (17 October 1797) meant the definitive end to the ancient Republic of Venice, which was disbanded and partitioned by the French and the [[Austrian Empire|Austrians]] gave a rude shock to Foscolo, but did not quite destroy his hopes. The state of mind produced by that shock is reflected in his novel ''[[The Last Letters of Jacopo Ortis]]'' (1798), which was described by the 1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' as a more politicized version of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]'s ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'', "for the hero of Foscolo embodies the mental sufferings and suicide of an undeceived Italian patriot just as the hero of Goethe places before us the too delicate sensitiveness embittering and at last cutting short the life of a private German scholar."<ref name=EB1911/>

The story of Foscolo, like that of Goethe, had a groundwork of melancholy fact. [[Jacopo Ortis]] had been a real person; he was a young student from [[Padua]], and committed suicide there under circumstances akin to those described by Foscolo.<ref name=EB1911/>

Foscolo, like many of his contemporaries, had thought much about suicide. [[Cato the Younger]] and the many classical examples of self-destruction described in [[Plutarch]]'s [[Parallel Lives|''Lives'']] appealed to the imaginations of young Italian patriots as they had done in France to those of the heroes and heroines of the [[Girondins|Gironde]]. In the case of Foscolo, as in that of Goethe, the effect produced on the writer's mind by the composition of the work seems to have been beneficial. He had seen the ideal of a great national future rudely shattered; but he did not despair of his country, and sought relief in now turning to gaze on the ideal of a great national poet.<ref name=EB1911/>

After the fall of Venice Foscolo moved to [[Milan]], where he formed a friendship with the older poet [[Giuseppe Parini]], whom he later remembered with admiration and gratitude.<ref name=EB1911/> In Milan, he published a choice of 12 [[Sonnet]]s, where he blends the passionate sentiments shown in ''Ortis'' with classical control of language and rhythm.

Still hoping that his country would be freed by Napoleon, he served as a volunteer in the French army, took part in the battle of the [[Trebbia]] and the siege of [[Genoa]], was wounded and made prisoner. When released he returned to Milan, and there gave the last touches to his ''Ortis'', published a translation of and commentary upon [[Callimachus]], commenced a version of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and began his translation of [[Laurence Sterne]]'s ''[[A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy]]''.<ref name=EB1911/> He also took part in a failed memorandum intended to present a new model of unified Italian government to Napoleon.

''English translation by Ugo Foscolo himself:''<br />
Beneath the cypress shade, or sculptured urn<br />
By fond tears watered, is the sleep of death<br />
Less heavy? — When for me the sun no more<br />
Shall shine on earth, to bless with genial beams<br />
This beauteous race of beings animate — <br />
When bright with flattering hues the coming hours<br />
No longer dance before me — and I hear<br />
No more, regarded friend, thy dulcet verse,<br />
Nor the sad gentle harmony it breathes —<br />
When mute within my breast the inspiring voice<br />
Of youthful poesy, and love, sole light<br />
To this my wandering life — what guerdon then <br />
For vanished years will be the marble reared<br />
To mark my dust amid the countless throng<br />
Wherewith the Spoiler strews the land and sea?<ref>From Robert Walsh, ''The American Quarterly Review'', Volume 16, p. 77</ref>

Before leaving France in 1806, Foscolo met [[Alessandro Manzoni]] once again, who was only seven years younger, in Paris. Manzoni was still living here in the house of his mother [[Giulia Beccaria]]. Some studies have compared the poetic production of Foscolo and Manzoni in the period from 1801 till 1803, with very close analogies (textual, metric and biographic) like in ''Alla amica risanata'', ode to [[Antonietta Fagnani Arese]], and ''Qual su le cinzie cime''.<ref>Pierantonio Frare, ''Foscolo e Manzoni – rapporti biografici e polemiche testuali'', in ''Rivista di letteratura italiana'', XVII, 1 (1999), pagg. 29–50</ref><ref>''Poesie di Alessandro Manzoni prima della conversione'', co note critiche di Alberto Chiari, LeMonnier, Firenze, 1932; and then in Franco Gavazzeni,  ''Alessandro Manzoni: poesie prima della conversione'', Einaudi, Torino, 1992</ref><ref>Gianmarco Gaspari,''Beccaria-Foscolo<---Manzoni'', Annali Manzoniani, I (1990), pagg. 197-218, also cited in ''Letteratura delle riforme'', Sellerio, Palermo, 1990, pagg. 232-258</ref>

In 1807, Foscolo wrote his ''[[Dei Sepolcri]]'', which may be described as a sublime effort to seek refuge in the past from the misery of the present and the darkness of the future. The mighty dead are summoned from their tombs, as ages before they had been in the masterpieces of Greek oratory, to fight again the battles of their country. The inaugural lecture ''On the origin and duty of literature'', delivered by Foscolo in January 1809 when appointed to the chair of Italian eloquence at [[Pavia]], was conceived in the same spirit. In this lecture Foscolo urged his young countrymen to study literature, not in obedience to academic traditions, but in their relation to individual and national life and growth.<ref name=EB1911/>

The sensation produced by this lecture had no slight share in provoking the decree of Napoleon by which the chair of national eloquence was abolished in all the Italian universities. Soon afterwards, Foscolo's tragedy of [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] was presented, with little success, at Milan, and because of its supposed allusions to Napoleon, he was forced to move from Milan to [[Tuscany]]. The chief fruits of his stay in [[Florence]] are the tragedy of ''Ricciarda'', the ''Ode to the Graces'', left unfinished, and the completion of his version of the ''Sentimental Journey'' (1813), having covered much of the ground covered by its main character the Reverend Yorick thanks to his time at the [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]] camp as part of [[Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom|Napoleon's invasion force against Britain]]. In his memoir of [[Didimo Chierico]], to whom the version is dedicated, Foscolo throws much light on his own character. His version of Sterne is an important feature in his personal history.<ref name=EB1911/>

Foscolo returned to Milan in 1813, until the entry of the Austrians; from there he passed into [[Switzerland]], where he wrote a fierce satire in Latin on his political and literary opponents; and finally he sought the shores of England at the close of 1816.<ref name=EB1911/>

==London==

During the eleven years spent by Foscolo in London, until his death there, he enjoyed all the social distinction which the most brilliant circles of the English capital could confer on foreigners of political and literary renown, and experienced all the misery which follows on from a disregard of the first conditions of domestic economy.

His contributions to the ''[[Edinburgh Review]]'' and ''[[Quarterly Review]]'', his dissertations in Italian on the text of [[Dante Alighieri]] and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], and still more his English essays on [[Petrarch]], of which the value was enhanced by [[Barbarina Brand]]'s admirable translations of some of Petrarch's finest sonnets, heightened his previous fame as a [[Intellectual#Man of Letters|Man of Letters]]. However, he was frequently accused of financial ineptitude, and ended up spending time in [[debtors' prison]], which affected his social standing after his release.<ref name="EB1911" />

According to the ''[[Victoria County History|History of the County of Middlesex]]'', the scientist and businessman [[William Allen (Quaker)|William Allen]] hired Foscolo to teach Italian at the Quaker school he co-founded, the [[Newington Academy for Girls]].<ref>A.P. Baggs, Diane K. Bolton and Patricia E.C. Croot, 'Stoke Newington: Education', in A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 8, Islington and Stoke Newington Parishes, ed. T. F. T. Baker and C. R. Elrington (London, 1985), pp. 217–23. British History Online http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol8/pp217-223 [accessed 28 March 2016].</ref> His general bearing in society – as reported by [[Walter Scott]] – had not been such as to gain and retain lasting friendships. He died at [[Turnham Green]] on 10 September 1827, and was buried at [[St Nicholas Church, Chiswick]], where his restored tomb remains to this day; it refers to him as the "wearied citizen poet", and incorrectly states his age as 50. Forty-four years after his death, on 7 June 1871, his remains were exhumed at the request of the King of Italy and taken to Florence, where with all the pride, pomp and circumstance of a great national mourning, found their final resting-place beside the monuments of [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] and [[Vittorio Alfieri]], of [[Michelangelo]] and [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], in the church of [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence|Santa Croce]],<ref name=EB1911/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/news-photo/exhumation-of-poet-ugo-foscolo-on-may-31-in-the-cemetery-of-news-photo/939653984|title="Exhumation of poet Ugo Foscolo (1778-1827), on May 31, 1871, in the cemetery of Chiswick, near London.

As noted by historian [[Lucy Riall]], the glorification of Ugo Foscolo in the 1870s was part of the effort of the Italian government of this time (successful in completing the [[Italian unification]] but at the cost of a head-on confrontation with the [[Catholic Church]]) to create a gallery of "secular saints" to compete with those of the Church and sway popular feeling in favor of the newly created Italian state.<ref>{{cite book | author=Riall, Lucy | title=Garibaldi : invention of a hero | publisher=Yale University Press | year=2007 | page=4}}</ref>
