== Writing ==

In 1986, Scott's short story "The House of Funerals" won the [[Tom-Gallon Trust Award|Tom-Gallon Award]].<ref name=Encyclopedia>Kim Robinson-Walcott, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nGfMAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA1414&lpg=PA1414&dq=witchbroom+scott+prize&source=bl&ots=JiHv2UuU5g&sig=iLgb4_DOKz1PHcxGRIJ9z7U7eNs&hl=en&sa=X&ei=A1-LU7_eOaiN7Qat-IDwCQ&ved=0CGUQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=witchbroom%20scott%20prize&f=false, "Scott, Lawrence"], in [[Eugene Benson]] and L. W. Conolly (eds), ''Encyclopedia of Post-Colonial Literatures in English'', [[Routledge]], 2nd edn 2005, p. 1414.</ref> Since 1992 his published books include four novels, a collection of short stories and a work of non-fiction.

His first novel, ''Witchbroom'' (1992), was shortlisted for a [[Commonwealth Writers' Prize]] and was broadcast as a ''[[Book at Bedtime]]'' on [[BBC Radio 4]]<ref name=Encyclopedia /> in 1993, abridged by [[Margaret Busby]] in eight episodes, produced by [[Marina Salandy-Brown]] and read by the author.<ref>[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/1862d8c579384c6d94e8e3d167735adb "A Book at Bedtime: Witchbroom"], ''Radio Times'', Issue 3624, 17 June 1993, p. 125.</ref><ref>[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Witchbroom-Lawrence-Scott/dp/0993108687 ''Witchbroom''] at Amazon.</ref> A 25th-anniversary edition of ''Witchbroom'', published by [[Papillote Press]], was launched in Trinidad at PaperBased bookshop in Port-of-Spain on 18 March 2017, with a keynote address by [[Earl Lovelace]] and readings by [[Ken Ramchand]], [[Barbara Jenkins]] and [[Marina Salandy-Brown]].<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.tt/lifestyle/2017-03-27/witchbroom%E2%80%99s-magic-rises-again "Witchbroom’s magic rises again"], ''Trinidad and Tobago Guardian'', 27 March 2017.</ref> It was described by ''[[Trinidad and Tobago Newsday]]'' as "a breathtaking novel, filled with memorable characters and important history."<ref>Debbie Jacob, [http://www.newsday.co.tt/features/0,241864.html "Where sexuality does not matter"], ''Newsday'', 3 April 207.</ref> According to the review in ''BookBlast'', "Lawrence Scott weaves a magical, lush tapestry of words and images, bringing alive local legends and family narratives; and redressing written histories. The impact of the events recounted still resonate in Caribbean society today. A quasi-historical novel, ''Witchbroom'' recounts the story of a colonial white enclave on an offshore island through muddled memories. ... The stories are bewitching and highly disturbing. The reader surfs a tidal wave of addictive fascination like a Dickensian tricoteuse sitting beside the guillotine in Paris watching heads roll during the public executions of 1793-4.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bookblast.com/blog/review-witchbroom-lawrence-scott-book-of-the-week/|title=Review {{!}}Witchbroom, Lawrence Scott {{!}} Book of the Week|website=BookBlast|author=Georgia De Chamberet|date=15 May 2017}}</ref>

Of his 1994 story collection ''Ballad for the New World'', ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' said: "Scott ... has filled his collection of 12 short stories with all the rich nuances of the Caribbean, creating a convincing backdrop that allows even the most sedentary armchair traveler to visualize each tale's progression."<ref>[http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-435-98939-2 "Ballad for the New World and Other Stories" (review)], ''Publishers' Weekly'', 10 March 1994.</ref>

Scott's second novel, ''Aelred's Sin'' (1998), described by [[Raoul Pantin]] as "a fine and sensitive and compassionate book…a worthwhile contribution to the hallowed tradition of West Indian literature",<ref>[http://www.lawrencescott.co.uk/lawrencescott-ay.html "Aelred's Sin"], Lawrence Scott website.</ref> won a Commonwealth Writers' Prize Best Book (Canada & Caribbean) in 1999. ''Night Calypso'' (2004), Scott's next novel, was described by [[Mike Phillips (writer)|Mike Phillips]] in ''[[The Guardian]]'' as "unique in being a serious, knowledgeable and beautifully written treatise about a little-known corner of experience and its relationship to a wider world",<ref>Mike Phillips, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/may/08/featuresreviews.guardianreview20 "Island at war"], ''The Guardian'', 8 May 2004.</ref> while [[Chris Searle]] in the ''[[Morning Star (British newspaper)|Morning Star]]'' called it "an educative, startling and moving reading experience".<ref>[http://www.lawrencescott.co.uk/lawrencescott-ni.html "Night Calypso/Calypso de Nuit"], Lawrence Scott website.</ref>

Scott's most recent novel, ''Light Falling on Bamboo'' (2012) was called "really a fascinating read" by Verdel Bishop in the ''[[Trinidad Express]]''.<ref>Verdel Bishop, [http://www.trinidadexpress.com/sunday-mix/Lawrence_Scott-180655761.html "Lawrence Scott...Fills in the blanks with 'Light Falling on Bamboo'"], ''Trinidad Express Newspapers'', 23 November 2012.</ref> Set in early 19th-century Trinidad, while the novel is a re-imagining of the life of the celebrated landscape painter [[Michel-Jean Cazabon|Cazabon]], according to [[Monique Roffey]]'s review in ''[[The Independent]]'' Scott captures so much more. This novel shows us the dark 'truth of an age' in a small corner of the New World, once dependent on slave labour."<ref>Monique Roffey, [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/light-falling-on-bamboo-by-lawrence-scott-8113818.html "Light Falling on Bamboo, By Lawrence Scott – A novel of 19th-century Trinidad captures the drama of division in a post-slavery society"], ''The Independent'', 8 September 2012.</ref> For the ''[[Financial Times]]'' reviewer, Scott has "conjured a convincing fictional portrait ... in this beautifully subtle and sensitive novel."<ref>David Evans, [https://www.ft.com/content/28816ce2-0c7b-11e2-a73c-00144feabdc0 "Quiet subversion"], ''Financial Times'', 5 October 2012.</ref> [[Selwyn Cudjoe]]'s review stated: "Lawrence Scott has written an important historical romance. [...] the loving attention that Scott devotes to detail, sensitivity to light and colour, and his determination to capture the many tones of his landscape and people give his romance a translucence and luminosity that is wondrous to behold. We owe him a debt of gratitude for offering us this way of seeing during this period in our history."<ref>Selwyn Cudjoe, [http://www.trinidadexpress.com/sunday-mix/Michel-Jean_Cazabon__The_Making_Of_A_West_Indian_Artist-186572931.html "Michel-Jean Cazabon: The Making Of A West Indian Artist"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315034047/http://www.trinidadexpress.com/sunday-mix/Michel-Jean_Cazabon__The_Making_Of_A_West_Indian_Artist-186572931.html |date=15 March 2016 }}, ''Trinidad Sunday Express'', 11 January 2013.</ref>

In 2015 Scott's collection of stories ''Leaving By Plane Swimming Back Underwater'' was published by Papillote Press.<ref>[http://papillotepress.co.uk/2014/11/leaving-by-plane-swimming-back-underwater/ ''Leaving by Plane, Swimming Back Underwater''] Papilotte Press.</ref> Alexander Lucie-Smith wrote in the ''[[Catholic Herald]]'': "Scott’s writing resembles that fretwork familiar from decaying porches and window frames: intricate, almost rococo, and because Trinidad is such a multi-layered place, because nothing is simple, his style is perfectly suited to his subject. Scott comes nearest to any English language author I know to carrying off that difficult task of evoking a place that is real and at the same time completely other."<ref>Alexander Lucie-Smith, [http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/commentandblogs/2015/02/13/the-paradise-island-drenched-in-pre-vatican-ii-catholicism/ "The paradise island drenched in pre-Vatican II Catholicism"], ''Catholic Herald'', 13 February 2015.</ref>
