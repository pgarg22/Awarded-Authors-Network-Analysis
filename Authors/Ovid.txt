==Overview==
He was the first major Roman poet to begin his career during Augustus's reign.<ref>[[Fergus Millar]], "Ovid and the Domus Augusta: Rome Seen from Tomoi", ''[[Journal of Roman Studies]]'' 83 (1993), p.&nbsp;6.</ref> Ovid was a contemporary of the older poets [[Virgil]] and [[Horace]]. Collectively, they are considered the three [[Western canon|canonical]] poets of [[Latin literature]]. The [[Roman Empire|Imperial]] scholar [[Quintilian]] described Ovid as the last of the Latin love [[wikt:elegist|elegists]].<ref name="Quint. Inst. 10.1.93">Quint. ''Inst.'' 10.1.93</ref> He enjoyed enormous popularity during his lifetime. Regardless, the emperor Augustus banished him to a remote province on the [[Black Sea]], where he remained until his death. Ovid himself attributes [[Exile of Ovid|his exile]] to ''carmen et error'' ("a poem and a mistake"). His reluctance to disclose specifics has resulted in much speculation among scholars.

Today, Ovid is most famous for the ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', a continuous mythological narrative in fifteen books written in the [[dactylic hexameter|meter of epic]]. He is also known for works in [[elegiac couplet]]s such as ''[[Ars Amatoria]]'' ("The Art of Love") and ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]''. His poetry was much imitated during [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]], and greatly influenced [[Western art]] and [[Western literature|literature]]. The ''Metamorphoses'' remains one of the most important sources of [[classical mythology]] today.<ref name="Mark P.O. Morford 1999 p. 25"/>

==Life==
Ovid talks more about his own life than most other Roman poets. Information about his biography is drawn primarily from his poetry, especially ''Tristia'' 4.10, which gives a lengthy autobiographical account of his life. Other sources include [[Seneca the Elder]] and [[Quintilian]].

===Birth, early life, and marriage===
[[Image:Sulmona0001.jpg|thumb|250px|Statue of Ovid by [[Ettore Ferrari]] in the Piazza XX Settembre, [[Sulmona]], Italy.]]
Ovid was born in the [[Paeligni]]an town of [[Sulmo]] (modern-day [[Sulmona]], in the [[province of L'Aquila]], [[Abruzzo]]), in an [[Apennine Mountains|Apennine]] valley east of [[Rome]], to an important [[Equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] family, the [[Ovidia gens|''gens Ovidia'']], on 20 March 43 BC. That was a significant year in Roman politics.{{Ref label|b|b|none}} Along with his brother, who excelled at oratory, Ovid was educated in rhetoric in Rome under the teachers [[Arellius Fuscus]] and [[Porcius Latro]].<ref>Seneca, ''Cont.'' 2.2.8 and 9.5.17</ref>

His father wanted him to study [[rhetoric]], so that he might practice law. According to Seneca the Elder, Ovid tended to the emotional, not the argumentative pole of rhetoric. Following the death of his brother at 20 years of age, Ovid renounced law and travelled to [[Athens, Greece|Athens]], [[Asia Minor]], and [[Sicily]].<ref>''Trist.'' 1.2.77</ref> He held minor public posts, as one of the ''[[Triumviri#Roman triumvirates|tresviri capitales]]'',<ref>''Trist.'' 4.10.33–34</ref> as a member of the [[Centumviral court]]<ref>''Trist.'' 2.93ff.; ''Ex P.'' 5.23ff.</ref> and as one of the ''[[Decemviri#Decemviri Litibus Iudicandis|decemviri litibus iudicandis]]'',<ref>''Fast.'' 4.383–34</ref> but resigned to pursue poetry probably around 29–25 BC, a decision of which his father apparently disapproved.<ref>''Trist.'' 4.10.21</ref>

Ovid's first recitation has been dated to around 25 BC, when he was eighteen.<ref>''Trist.'' 4.10.57–58</ref> He was part of the circle centred on the esteemed patron [[Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus]], and likewise seems to have been a friend of poets in the circle of [[Gaius Maecenas|Maecenas]]. In ''Trist.'' 4.10.41–54, Ovid mentions friendships with [[Aemilius Macer|Macer]], [[Sextus Propertius|Propertius]], [[Horace]], Ponticus and Bassus. (He only barely met Virgil and Tibullus, a fellow member of Messalla's circle, whose elegies he admired greatly).

He married three times and had divorced twice by the time he was thirty. He had one daughter, who would bear him grandchildren.<ref name="HornblowerSpawforth2014">{{cite book|last1=Hornblower|first1=Simon|last2=Spawforth|first2=Antony|last3=Eidinow|first3=Esther|title=The Oxford Companion to Classical Civilization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AIgdBAAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0198706779 |page=562}}</ref> His last wife was connected in some way to the influential ''[[gens Fabia]]'' and would help him during his exile in Tomis (now [[Constanța]] in [[Romania]]).<ref>''Brill's New Pauly: Encyclopaedia of the Ancient World'' s.v. Ovid</ref>

===Literary success===
Ovid spent the first 25 years of his literary career primarily writing poetry in [[Elegiac|elegiac meter]] with erotic themes.<ref>The most recent chart that describes the dating of Ovid's works is in Knox. P. "A Poet's Life" in ''A Companion to Ovid'' ed. Peter Knox (Oxford, 2009) pp. xvii–xviii</ref> The chronology of these early works is not secure; tentative dates, however, have been established by scholars. His earliest extant work is thought to be the ''Heroides'', letters of mythological heroines to their absent lovers, which may have been published in 19 BC, although the date is uncertain as it depends on a notice in ''Am.'' 2.18.19–26 that seems to describe the collection as an early published work.<ref name="Trist. 4.10.53–4">''Trist.'' 4.10.53–54</ref>

The authenticity of some of these poems has been challenged, but this first edition probably contained the first 14 poems of the collection. The first five-book collection of the ''[[Amores (Ovid)|Amores]]'', a series of erotic poems addressed to a lover, Corinna, is thought to have been published in 16–15 BC; the surviving version, redacted to three books according to an epigram prefixed to the first book, is thought to have been published c. 8–3 BC. Between the publications of the two editions of the ''Amores'' can be dated the premiere of his tragedy ''Medea'', which was admired in antiquity but is no longer extant.

Ovid's next poem, the ''Medicamina Faciei'', a fragmentary work on women's beauty treatments, preceded the ''[[Ars Amatoria]]'', the ''Art of Love'', a parody of [[didactic poetry]] and a three-book manual about seduction and intrigue, which has been dated to AD 2 (Books 1–2 would go back to 1 BC<ref>{{cite book | last = Hornblower | first = Simon |author2=Antony Spawforth | title = Oxford Classical Dictionary | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1996 | page = [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780198661726/page/1085 1085] | isbn = 978-0-19-866172-6 | url =https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780198661726| url-access = registration }}</ref>). Ovid may identify this work in his exile poetry as the ''carmen'', or song, which was one cause of his banishment. The ''Ars Amatoria'' was followed by the ''Remedia Amoris'' in the same year. This corpus of elegiac, erotic poetry earned Ovid a place among the chief Roman elegists Gallus, Tibullus, and Propertius, of whom he saw himself as the fourth member.<ref name="Trist. 4.10.53–4"/>

By 8 AD, Ovid had completed ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', his most ambitious work, a hexameter [[epic poem]] in 15 books. Here he  catalogued encyclopaedically transformations in Greek and Roman mythology, from the emergence of the cosmos to the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|apotheosis]] of [[Julius Caesar]]. The stories follow each other in the telling of human beings transformed to new bodies: trees, rocks, animals, flowers, [[constellation]]s etc. Simultaneously, he worked on the ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', a six-book poem in elegiac couplets on the theme of the calendar of [[Roman festivals]] and astronomy. The composition of this poem was interrupted by Ovid's exile,{{Ref label|c|c|none}} and it is thought that Ovid abandoned work on the piece in Tomis. It is probably in this period that the double letters (16–21) in the ''Heroides'' were composed, although there is some contention over their authorship.

===Exile to Tomis===
{{Main|Exile of Ovid}}
In AD 8, Ovid was banished to [[Constanța|Tomis]], on the [[Black Sea]], by the exclusive intervention of the Emperor [[Augustus]], without any participation of the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] or of any [[Roman law|Roman judge]].<ref>See ''Trist''. II, 131–32.</ref> This event shaped all his following poetry. Ovid wrote that the reason for his exile was ''carmen et error'' – "a poem and a mistake",<ref>Ovid, ''Tristia'' 2.207</ref> claiming that his crime was worse than [[murder]],<ref>Ovid, ''Epistulae ex Ponto'' 2.9.72</ref> more harmful than poetry.<ref>Ovid, ''Epistulae ex Ponto'' 3.3.72</ref>

The Emperor's grandchildren, [[Julia the Younger]] and [[Agrippa Postumus]] (the latter adopted by him), were also banished around the same time. Julia's husband, [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus (consul 1)|Lucius Aemilius Paullus]], was put to death for a [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] against [[Augustus]], a conspiracy of which Ovid potentially knew.<ref>Norwood, Frances, "The Riddle of Ovid's Relegatio", ''Classical Philology'' (1963) p. 158</ref>

The [[Lex Julia|Julian marriage laws of 18 BC]], which promoted [[monogamy|monogamous]] marriage to increase the population's birth rate, were fresh in the Roman mind. Ovid's writing in the ''Ars Amatoria'' concerned the serious crime of [[adultery]]. He may have been banished for these works, which appeared subversive to the emperor's moral legislation. However, in view of the long time that elapsed between the publication of this work (1 BC) and the exile (AD 8), some authors suggest that [[Augustus]] used the poem as a mere justification for something more personal.<ref name="José González Vázquez 1992 p.10">José González Vázquez (trans.), Ov. ''Tristes e Pónticas'' (Editorial Gredos, Madrid, 1992), p. 10 and Rafael Herrera Montero (trans.), Ov. ''Tristes; Cartas del Ponto'' (Alianza Editorial, Madrid, 2002). The scholars also add that it was no more indecent than many publications by [[Propertius]], [[Tibullus]] and [[Horace]] that circulated freely in that time.</ref>

[[Image:Turner Ovid Banished from Rome.jpg|thumb|280px| ''Ovid Banished from Rome'' (1838) by [[Joseph Mallord William Turner|J.M.W. Turner]].]]
In exile, Ovid wrote two poetry collections, ''[[Tristia]]'' and ''[[Epistulae ex Ponto]]'', which illustrated his sadness and desolation. Being far from Rome, he had no access to libraries, and thus might have been forced to abandon his ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', a poem about the Roman calendar, of which only the first six books exist – January through June.

The five books of the elegiac ''Tristia'', a series of poems expressing the poet's despair in exile and advocating his return to Rome, are dated to AD 9–12. The ''Ibis'', an elegiac curse poem attacking an adversary at home, may also be dated to this period. The ''[[Epistulae ex Ponto]]'', a series of letters to friends in Rome asking them to effect his return, are thought to be his last compositions, with the first three books published in AD 13 and the fourth book between AD 14 and 16. The exile poetry is particularly emotive and personal. In the ''Epistulae'' he claims friendship with the natives of Tomis (in the ''Tristia'' they are frightening barbarians) and to have written a poem in their language (''Ex P''. 4.13.19–20).

Yet he pined for Rome&nbsp;– and for his third wife, addressing many poems to her. Some are also to the Emperor Augustus, yet others are to himself, to friends in Rome, and sometimes to the poems themselves, expressing loneliness and hope of recall from banishment or exile.<ref>The first two lines of the ''Tristia'' communicate his misery:''Parve – nec invideo – sine me, liber, ibis in urbem; ei mihi, quod domino non licet ire tuo!''
: "Little book – for I don't begrudge it – go on to the city without me; Alas for me, because your master is not allowed to go with you!"</ref>

The obscure causes of Ovid's exile have given rise to endless explanations from scholars. The medieval texts that mention the exile offer no credible explanations: their statements seem incorrect interpretations drawn from the works of Ovid.<ref>J. C. Thibault, ''The Mystery of Ovid's Exile'' (Berkeley-L. A. 1964), pp. 20–32.</ref> Ovid himself wrote many references to his offense, giving obscure or contradictory clues.<ref>About 33 mentions, according to Thibault (''Mystery'', pp. 27–31).</ref>

In 1923, scholar J. J. Hartman proposed a theory that is little considered among scholars of Latin civilization today: that Ovid was never exiled from Rome and that all of his exile works are the result of his fertile imagination. This theory was supported and rejected{{clarify|date=October 2013}} in the 1930s, especially by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] authors.<ref>A. W. J. Holleman, "Ovid's exile", ''Liverpool Classical Monthly'' 10.3 (1985), p. 48.<br />H. Hofmann, "The unreality of Ovid's Tomitan exile once again", ''Liverpool Classical Monthly'' 12.2 (1987), p. 23.</ref>

In 1985, a research paper by Fitton Brown advanced new arguments in support of Hartman's theory.<ref>A. D. F. Brown, "The unreality of Ovid's Tomitan exile", ''Liverpool Classical Monthly'' 10.2 (1985), pp. 18–22.</ref> Brown's article was followed by a series of supports and refutations in the short space of five years.<ref>Cf. the summary provided by A. Alvar Ezquerra, ''Exilio y elegía latina entre la Antigüedad y el Renacimiento'' (Huelva, 1997), pp. 23–24</ref> Among the supporting reasons Brown presents are: Ovid's exile is only mentioned by his own work, except in "dubious" passages by [[Pliny the Elder]]<ref>''Naturalis Historia'', 32.152: "His adiciemus ab Ovidio posita animalia, quae apud neminem alium reperiuntur, sed fortassis in Ponto nascentia, ubi id volumen supremis suis temporibus inchoavit".</ref> and [[Statius]],<ref>''Silvae'', 1.2, 254–55: "nec tristis in ipsis Naso Tomis".</ref> but no other author until the 4th&nbsp;century;<ref>Short references in Jerome (''Chronicon'', 2033, an. Tiberii 4, an. Dom. 17: "Ovidius poeta in exilio diem obiit et iuxta oppidum Tomos sepelitur") and in ''Epitome de Caesaribus'' (I, 24: "Nam [Augustus] poetam Ovidium, qui et Naso, pro eo, quod tres libellos amatoriae artis conscripsit, exilio damnavit").</ref> that the author of ''[[Heroides]]'' was able to separate the poetic "I" of his own and real life; and that information on the geography of Tomis was already known by [[Virgil]], by [[Herodotus]] and by Ovid himself in his ''[[Metamorphoses]]''.{{Ref label|d|d|none}}<ref>A. D. F. Brown, "The unreality of Ovid's Tomitan exile", ''Liverpool Classical Monthly'' 10.2 (1985), pp. 20–21.</ref>

Orthodox scholars, however, oppose these hypotheses.<ref>J. M. Claassen, "Error and the imperial household: an angry god and the exiled Ovid's fate", ''Acta classica: proceedings of the Classical Association of South Africa'' 30 (1987), pp. 31–47.</ref> One of the main arguments of these scholars is that Ovid would not let his ''Fasti'' remain unfinished, mainly because this poem meant his consecration as an imperial poet.<ref>Although some authors such as Martin (P. M. Martin, "À propos de l'exil d'Ovide... et de la succession d'Auguste", ''Latomus'' 45 (1986), pp. 609–11.) and Porte (D. Porte, "Un épisode satirique des ''Fastes'' et l'exil d'Ovide", ''Latomus'' 43 (1984), pp. 284–306.) detected in a passage of the ''Fasti'' (2.371–80) an Ovidian attitude contrary to the wishes of [[Augustus]] to his succession, most researchers agree that this work is the clearest testimony of support of Augustan ideals by Ovid (E. Fantham, ''Ovid: Fasti. Book IV'' (Cambridge 1998), p. 42.)</ref>

===Death===
Ovid died at Tomis in 17 or 18 AD.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=16zxAgAAQBAJ&q=Ancient+Rome:+An+Anthology+of+Sources|title=Ancient Rome: An Anthology of Sources|last=Smith|first=R.

==Works==

===''Heroides'' ("The Heroines")===
[[Image:Herkulaneischer Meister 001.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Medea]] in a fresco from [[Herculaneum]].]]
{{Main| Heroides}}
{{See also| Double Heroides}}

The ''Heroides'' ("Heroines") or ''Epistulae Heroidum'' are a collection of twenty-one poems in elegiac couplets. The ''Heroides'' take the form of letters addressed by famous mythological characters to their partners expressing their emotions at being separated from them, pleas for their return, and allusions to their future actions within their own mythology. The authenticity of the collection, partially or as a whole, has been questioned, although most scholars would consider the letters mentioned specifically in Ovid's description of the work at ''Am.'' 2.18.19–26 as safe from objection. The collection comprises a new type of generic composition without parallel in earlier literature.<ref>Knox, P. ''Ovid's Heroides: Select Epistles'' (Cambridge, 1995) pp. 14ff.</ref>

The first fourteen letters are thought to comprise the first published collection and are written by the heroines [[Penelope]], [[Phyllis (mythology)|Phyllis]], [[Briseis]], [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]], [[Oenone]], [[Hypsipyle]], [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]], [[Hermione (mythology)|Hermione]], [[Deianeira]], [[Ariadne]], [[Canace]], [[Medea]], [[Laodamia of Phylace|Laodamia]], and [[Hypermestra]] to their absent male lovers. Letter 15, from the historical [[Sappho]] to [[Phaon]], seems spurious (although referred to in ''Am.'' 2.18) because of its length, its lack of integration in the mythological theme, and its absence from Medieval manuscripts.<ref>Knox, P. pp. 12–13</ref> The final letters (16–21) are paired compositions comprising a letter to a lover and a reply. [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] and [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], [[Hero and Leander]], and [[Acontius]] and [[Cydippe]] are the addressees of the paired letters. These are considered a later addition to the corpus because they are never mentioned by Ovid and may or may not be spurious.

The ''Heroides'' markedly reveal the influence of rhetorical declamation and may derive from Ovid's interest in rhetorical ''[[suasoria]]e'', persuasive speeches, and ''[[ethopoeia]]'', the practice of speaking in another character. They also play with generic conventions; most of the letters seem to refer to works in which these characters were significant, such as the ''[[Aeneid]]'' in the case of Dido and [[Catullus]] 64 for Ariadne, and transfer characters from the genres of epic and tragedy to the elegiac genre of the ''Heroides''.<ref>Knox, P. pp. 18ff.</ref> The letters have been admired for their deep psychological portrayals of mythical characters, their rhetoric, and their unique attitude to the classical tradition of mythology.{{by whom|date=November 2015}} They also contribute significantly to conversations on how gender and identity were constructed in Augustan Rome.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lindheim |first1=Sara H. |title=Mail and Female: Epistolary Narrative and Desire in Ovid's Heroides |date=2003 |publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press}}</ref>

A popular quote from the Heroides anticipates Machiavelli's "the end justifies the means". Ovid had written "Exitus acta probat" - the result justifies the means.

===''Amores'' ("The Loves")===
{{Main| Amores (Ovid)}}

The ''Amores'' is a collection in three books of love poetry in elegiac meter, following the conventions of the elegiac genre developed by [[Tibullus]] and [[Propertius]]. Elegy originates with Propertius and Tibullus; however, Ovid is an innovator in the genre. Ovid changes the leader of his elegies from the poet, to Amor (Love or Cupid). This switch in focus from the triumphs of the poet, to the triumphs of love over people is the first of its kind for this genre of poetry. This Ovidian innovation can be summarized as the use of love as a metaphor for poetry.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Athanassaki|first1=Lucia|title=The Triumph of Love in Ovid's Amores 1, 2|journal=Materiali e Discussioni per l'Analisi dei Testi Classici|date=1992|volume=No. 28|issue=28|pages=125–41|doi=10.2307/40236002|jstor=40236002}}</ref> The books describe the many aspects of love and focus on the poet's relationship with a mistress called Corinna. Within the various poems, several describe events in the relationship, thus presenting the reader with some vignettes and a loose narrative.

Book 1 contains 15 poems. The first tells of Ovid's intention to write epic poetry, which is thwarted when [[Cupid]] steals a metrical foot from him, changing his work into love elegy.
Poem 4 is didactic and describes principles that Ovid would develop in the ''[[Ars Amatoria]]''. The fifth poem, describing a noon tryst, introduces Corinna by name. Poems 8 and 9 deal with Corinna selling her love for gifts, while 11 and 12 describe the poet's failed attempt to arrange a meeting. Poem 14 discusses Corinna's disastrous experiment in dyeing her hair and 15 stresses the immortality of Ovid and love poets.

The second book has 19 pieces; the opening poem tells of Ovid's abandonment of a [[Gigantomachy]] in favor of [[elegy]]. Poems 2 and 3 are entreaties to a guardian to let the poet see Corinna, poem 6 is a lament for Corinna's dead parrot; poems 7 and 8 deal with Ovid's affair with Corinna's servant and her discovery of it, and 11 and 12 try to prevent Corinna from going on vacation. Poem 13 is a prayer to [[Isis]] for Corinna's illness, 14 a poem against abortion, and 19 a warning to unwary husbands.

Book 3 has 15 poems. The opening piece depicts personified Tragedy and Elegy fighting over Ovid. Poem 2 describes a visit to the races, 3 and 8 focus on Corinna's interest in other men, 10 is a complaint to [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] because of her festival that requires abstinence, 13 is a poem on a festival of [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], and 9 a lament for [[Tibullus]]. In poem 11 Ovid decides not to love Corinna any longer and regrets the poems he has written about her. The final poem is Ovid's farewell to the erotic muse. Critics have seen the poems as highly self-conscious and extremely playful specimens of the elegiac genre.<ref>Conte, G. p. 343</ref>

===''Medicamina Faciei Femineae'' ("Women's Facial Cosmetics")===
{{Main| Medicamina Faciei Femineae}}

About a hundred elegiac lines survive from this poem on beauty treatments for women's faces, which seems to parody serious didactic poetry. The poem says that women should concern themselves first with manners and then prescribes several compounds for facial treatments before breaking off. The style is not unlike the shorter [[Hellenistic]] didactic works of [[Nicander]] and [[Aratus]].

===''Ars Amatoria'' ("The Art of Love")===
{{Main| Ars Amatoria}}
<blockquote><poem>
      Si quis in hoc artem populo non novit amandi,
           hoc legat et lecto carmine doctus amet.<ref>Book 1 Verse 1,  2: "If you do not know the art of love, read my book, and you will be a 'doctor' of love in the future".</ref>
</poem></blockquote>

The ''Ars Amatoria'' is a [[:de:Lehrgedicht|Lehrgedicht]], a didactic elegiac poem in three books that sets out to teach the arts of seduction and love. The first book addresses men and teaches them how to seduce women, the second, also to men, teaches how to keep a lover. The third addresses women and teaches seduction techniques. The first book opens with an invocation to Venus, in which Ovid establishes himself as a ''praeceptor amoris'' (1.17)&nbsp;– a teacher of love. Ovid describes the places one can go to find a lover, like the theater, a triumph, which he thoroughly describes, or arena&nbsp;– and ways to get the girl to take notice, including seducing her covertly at a banquet. Choosing the right time is significant, as is getting into her associates' confidence.

Ovid emphasizes care of the body for the lover. Mythological digressions include a piece on the [[Rape of the Sabine women]], [[Pasiphaë]], and [[Ariadne]]. Book 2 invokes Apollo and begins with a telling of the story of [[Icarus]]. Ovid advises men to avoid giving too many gifts, keep up their appearance, hide affairs, compliment their lovers, and ingratiate themselves with slaves to stay on their lover's good side. The care of Venus for procreation is described as is Apollo's aid in keeping a lover; Ovid then digresses on the story of [[Hephaestus#Hephaestus and Aphrodite|Vulcan's trap for Venus and Mars]]. The book ends with Ovid asking his "students" to spread his fame. Book 3 opens with a vindication of women's abilities and Ovid's resolution to arm women against his teaching in the first two books. Ovid gives women detailed instructions on appearance telling them to avoid too many adornments. He advises women to read elegiac poetry, learn to play games, sleep with people of different ages, flirt, and dissemble. Throughout the book, Ovid playfully interjects, criticizing himself for undoing all his didactic work to men and mythologically digresses on the story of [[Procris#Ovid|Procris]] and [[Cephalus#Husband of Procris|Cephalus]]. The book ends with his wish that women will follow his advice and spread his fame saying ''Naso magister erat,'' "Ovid was our teacher". (Ovid was known as "Naso" to his contemporaries.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Liveley, Genevieve.|title=Ovid's Metamorphoses : a reader's guide|date=2011|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-1-4411-7081-1|location=London|oclc=703573507}}</ref>)

===''Remedia Amoris'' ("The Cure for Love")===
{{Main| Remedia Amoris}}

This elegiac poem proposes a cure for the love Ovid teaches in the ''Ars Amatoria'', and is primarily addressed to men. The poem criticizes suicide as a means for escaping love and, invoking Apollo, goes on to tell lovers not to procrastinate and be lazy in dealing with love. Lovers are taught to avoid their partners, not perform magic, see their lover unprepared, take other lovers, and never be jealous. Old letters should be burned and the lover's family avoided. The poem throughout presents Ovid as a doctor and utilizes medical imagery. Some have interpreted this poem as the close of Ovid's didactic cycle of love poetry and the end of his erotic elegiac project.<ref>Conte, G. ''Latin Literature a History'' trans. J.

===''Metamorphoses'' ("Transformations")===
[[File:Ovidius Metamorphosis - George Sandy's 1632 edition.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Engraved frontispiece of [[George Sandys]]’s 1632 London edition of ''Ovid's Metamorphoses Englished''.]]
{{Main| Metamorphoses}}
The ''Metamorphoses'', Ovid's most ambitious and well-known work, consists of a 15-book catalogue written in [[dactylic hexameter]] about transformations in Greek and Roman mythology set within a loose mytho-historical framework. The word "metamorphoses" is of Greek origin and means "transformations". Appropriately, the characters in this work undergo many different transformations. Within an extent of nearly 12,000 verses, almost 250 different myths are mentioned. Each myth is set outdoors where the mortals are often vulnerable to external influences.  The poem stands in the tradition of mythological and aetiological catalogue poetry such as [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Catalogue of Women]]'', [[Callimachus]]' ''[[Aetia (Callimachus)|Aetia]]'', [[Nicander]]'s ''Heteroeumena'', and [[Parthenius of Nicaea|Parthenius]]' ''Metamorphoses''.

The first book describes the formation of the world, the [[ages of man]], the [[Flood myth|flood]], the story of [[Daphne]]'s rape by Apollo and [[Io (mythology)|Io]]'s by Jupiter. The second book opens with [[Phaethon#Ovid|Phaethon]] and continues describing the love of Jupiter with [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]] and [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]]. The third book focuses on the mythology of [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]] with the stories of [[Cadmus]], [[Actaeon]], and [[Pentheus]]. The fourth book focuses on three pairs of lovers: [[Pyramus]] and [[Thisbe]], [[Salmacis]] and [[Hermaphroditus]], and [[Perseus]] and [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]]. The fifth book focuses on the song of the [[Muses]], which describes the rape of [[Proserpina]]. The sixth book is a collection of stories about the rivalry between gods and mortals, beginning with [[Arachne]] and ending with [[Philomela (princess of Athens)|Philomela]]. The seventh book focuses on [[Medea]], as well as [[Cephalus]] and [[Procris]]. The eighth book focuses on [[Daedalus]]' flight, the [[Calydonian boar]] hunt, and the contrast between pious [[Baucis and Philemon]] and the wicked [[Erysichthon of Thessaly|Erysichthon]]. The ninth book focuses on [[Heracles]] and the incestuous [[Byblis]]. The tenth book focuses on stories of doomed love, such as [[Orpheus]], who sings about [[Hyacinth (mythology)|Hyacinthus]], as well as [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]], [[Myrrha]], and [[Adonis]]. The eleventh book compares the marriage of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]] with the love of [[Ceyx]] and [[Alcyone]]. The twelfth book moves from myth to history describing the exploits of [[Achilles]], the [[Lapith#Centauromachy|battle of the centaurs]], and [[Iphigeneia]]. The thirteenth book discusses the [[Achilles#Fate of Achilles' armor|contest over Achilles' arms]], and [[Polyphemus]]. The fourteenth moves to Italy, describing the journey of [[Aeneas]], [[Pomona (mythology)|Pomona]] and [[Vertumnus]], and [[Romulus]] and [[Hersilia]]. The final book opens with a philosophical lecture by [[Pythagoras]] and the deification of [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]. The end of the poem praises [[Augustus]] and expresses Ovid's belief that his poem has earned him immortality.

In analyzing the ''Metamorphoses'', scholars have focused on Ovid's organization of his vast body of material. The ways that stories are linked by geography, themes, or contrasts creates interesting effects and constantly forces the reader to evaluate the connections. Ovid also varies his tone and material from different literary genres; [[Gian Biagio Conte|G. B. Conte]] has called the poem "a sort of gallery of these various literary genres".<ref>Conte, G. p. 352</ref> In this spirit, Ovid engages creatively with his predecessors, alluding to the full spectrum of classical poetry. Ovid's use of Alexandrian epic, or elegiac couplets, shows his fusion of erotic and psychological style with traditional forms of epic.

A concept drawn from the Metamorphoses is the idea of the white lie or [[pious fraud]]: "pia mendacia fraude".

===''Fasti'' ("The Festivals")===
{{Main| Fasti (poem)}}

Six books in elegiacs survive of this second ambitious poem that Ovid was working on when he was exiled. The six books cover the first semester of the year, with each book dedicated to a different month of the [[Roman calendar]] (January to June). The project seems unprecedented in Roman literature. It seems that Ovid planned to cover the whole year, but was unable to finish because of his exile, although he did revise sections of the work at Tomis, and he claims at ''Trist.'' 2.549–52 that his work was interrupted after six books. Like the ''Metamorphoses'', the ''Fasti'' was to be a long poem and emulated aetiological poetry by writers like [[Callimachus]] and, more recently, [[Propertius]] and his fourth book. The poem goes through the Roman calendar, explaining the origins and customs of important Roman festivals, digressing on mythical stories, and giving astronomical and agricultural information appropriate to the season. The poem was probably dedicated to [[Augustus]] initially, but perhaps the death of the emperor prompted Ovid to change the dedication to honor [[Germanicus]]. Ovid uses direct inquiry of gods and scholarly research to talk about the calendar and regularly calls himself a ''[[vates]]'', a priest. He also seems to emphasize unsavory, popular traditions of the festivals, imbuing the poem with a popular, [[plebeian]] flavor, which some have interpreted as subversive to the Augustan moral legislation.<ref>Herbert-Brown, G. "Fasti: the Poet, the Prince, and the Plebs" in Knox, P. (2009) pp. 126ff.</ref> While this poem has always been invaluable to students of Roman religion and culture for the wealth of antiquarian material it preserves, it recently has been seen as one of Ovid's finest literary works and a unique contribution to Roman elegiac poetry.

===''Ibis'' ("The Ibis")===
{{Main| Ibis (Ovid)}}

The ''Ibis'' is an elegiac poem in 644 lines, in which Ovid uses a dazzling array of mythic stories to curse and attack an enemy who is harming him in exile. At the beginning of the poem, Ovid claims that his poetry up to that point had been harmless, but now he is going to use his abilities to hurt his enemy. He cites Callimachus' ''Ibis'' as his inspiration and calls all the gods to make his curse effective. Ovid uses mythical exempla to condemn his enemy in the afterlife, cites evil prodigies that attended his birth, and then in the next 300 lines wishes that the torments of mythological characters befall his enemy. The poem ends with a prayer that the gods make his curse effective.

===''Tristia'' ("Sorrows")===
{{Main| Tristia}}

The ''Tristia'' consist of five books of elegiac poetry composed by Ovid in exile in Tomis.

Book 1 contains 11 poems; the first piece is an address by Ovid to his book about how it should act when it arrives in Rome. Poem 3 describes his final night in Rome, poems 2 and 10 Ovid's voyage to Tomis, 8 the betrayal of a friend, and 5 and 6 the loyalty of his friends and wife. In the final poem Ovid apologizes for the quality and tone of his book, a sentiment echoed throughout the collection.

Book 2 consists of one long poem in which Ovid defends himself and his poetry, uses precedents to justify his work, and begs the emperor for forgiveness.

Book 3 in 14 poems focuses on Ovid's life in Tomis. The opening poem describes his book's arrival in Rome to find Ovid's works banned. Poems 10, 12, and 13 focus on the seasons spent in Tomis, 9 on the origins of the place, and 2, 3, and 11 his emotional distress and longing for home. The final poem is again an apology for his work.

The fourth book has ten poems addressed mostly to friends. Poem 1 expresses his love of poetry and the solace it brings; while 2 describes a triumph of Tiberius. Poems 3–5 are to friends, 7 a request for correspondence, and 10 an autobiography.

The final book of the ''Tristia'' with 14 poems focuses on his wife and friends. Poems 4, 5, 11, and 14 are addressed to his wife, 2 and 3 are prayers to [[Augustus]] and [[Bacchus]], 4 and 6 are to friends, 8 to an enemy. Poem 13 asks for letters, while 1 and 12 are apologies to his readers for the quality of his poetry.

===''Epistulae ex Ponto'' ("Letters from the Black Sea")===
{{Main| Epistulae ex Ponto}}

The ''Epistulae ex Ponto'' is a collection in four books of further poetry from exile. The ''Epistulae'' are each addressed to a different friend and focus more desperately than the ''Tristia'' on securing his recall from exile. The poems mainly deal with requests for friends to speak on his behalf to members of the imperial family, discussions of writing with friends, and descriptions of life in exile. The first book has ten pieces in which Ovid describes the state of his health (10), his hopes, memories, and yearning for Rome (3, 6, 8), and his needs in exile (3). Book 2 contains impassioned requests to Germanicus (1 and 5) and various friends to speak on his behalf at Rome while he describes his despair and life in exile. Book 3 has nine poems in which Ovid addresses his wife (1) and various friends. It includes a telling of the story of [[Iphigenia#Among the Taurians|Iphigenia in Tauris]] (2), a poem against criticism (9), and a dream of Cupid (3). Book 4, the final work of Ovid, in 16 poems talks to friends and describes his life as an exile further. Poems 10 and 13 describe Winter and Spring at Tomis, poem 14 is halfhearted praise for Tomis, 7 describes its geography and climate, and 4 and 9 are congratulations on friends for their consulships and requests for help. Poem 12 is addressed to a Tuticanus, whose name, Ovid complains, does not fit into meter. The final poem is addressed to an enemy whom Ovid implores to leave him alone. The last elegiac couplet is translated: "Where’s the joy in stabbing your steel into my dead flesh?/ There’s no place left where I can be dealt fresh wounds."<ref>[http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/OvidExPontoBkFour.htm PoetryInTranslation.com], a translation of all of Ovid's exile poetry can be found here by A. S. Kline, 2003</ref>

===Lost works===
One loss, which Ovid himself described, is the first five-book edition of the ''Amores'', from which nothing has come down to us. The greatest loss is Ovid's only tragedy, ''Medea'', from which only a few lines are preserved. [[Quintilian]] admired the work a great deal and considered it a prime example of Ovid's poetic talent.<ref>Quint. ''Inst.'' 10.1.98. Cfr. Tacitus, ''Dial. Orat.'' 12.</ref> [[Lactantius]] quotes from a lost translation by Ovid of [[Aratus]]' ''Phaenomena'', although the poem's ascription to Ovid is insecure because it is never mentioned in Ovid's other works.<ref>Lact. ''Div. Inst.'' 2.5.24. Another quotation by [[Marcus Valerius Probus|Probus]] ''ad Verg. Georg.'' 1, 138</ref>
A line from a work entitled ''Epigrammata'' is cited by [[Priscian]].<ref>''Inst. gramm.'' 5, 13, ''Gramm. Lat.'' 2, 149, 13 Keil.</ref>
Even though it is unlikely, if the last six books of the ''Fasti'' ever existed, they constitute a great loss. Ovid also mentions some occasional poetry (''[[Epithalamium]]'',<ref>''Ex P.'' 1.2.131</ref> dirge,<ref>''Ex P.'' 1.7.30</ref> even a rendering in [[Getae#Culture|Getic]]<ref>''Ex P.'' 4.13.19></ref>) which does not survive. Also lost is the final portion of the ''Medicamina''.

==Spurious works==

===''Consolatio ad Liviam'' ("Consolation to Livia")===
The ''Consolatio'' is a long elegiac poem of consolation to [[Augustus]]' wife [[Livia]] on the death of her son [[Nero Claudius Drusus]]. The poem opens by advising Livia not to try to hide her sad emotions and contrasts Drusus' military virtue with his death. Drusus' funeral and the tributes of the imperial family are described as are his final moments and Livia's lament over the body, which is compared to birds. The laments of the city of Rome as it greets his funeral procession and the gods are mentioned, and Mars from his temple dissuades the Tiber river from quenching the pyre out of grief.<ref name="Knox, P 2009 pg.214">Knox, P. "Lost and Spurious Works" in Knox, P. (2009) p. 214</ref>

Grief is expressed for his lost military honors, his wife, and his mother. The poet asks Livia to look for consolation in [[Tiberius]]. The poem ends with an address by Drusus to Livia assuring him of his fate in Elysium. Although this poem was connected to the ''[[Elegiae in Maecenatem]]'', it is now thought that they are unconnected. The date of the piece is unknown, but a date in the reign of Tiberius has been suggested because of that emperor's prominence in the poem.<ref name="Knox, P 2009 pg.214"/>

===''Halieutica'' ("On Fishing")===
The ''Halieutica'' is a fragmentary didactic poem in 134 poorly preserved hexameter lines and is considered spurious. The poem begins by describing how every animal possesses the ability to protect itself and how fish use ''ars'' to help themselves. The ability of dogs and land creatures to protect themselves is described. The poem goes on to list the best places for fishing, and which types of fish to catch. Although [[Pliny the Elder]] mentions a ''Halieutica'' by Ovid, which was composed at Tomis near the end of Ovid's life, modern scholars believe Pliny was mistaken in his attribution and that the poem is not genuine.<ref>Pliny ''Nat.'' 32.11 and 32.152 and Knox, P. "Lost" in Knox, P. (2009)</ref>

===''Nux'' ("The Walnut Tree")===
This short poem in 91 elegiac couplets is related to [[Aesop's Fables|Aesop's fable]] of "[[The Walnut Tree]]" that was the subject of human ingratitude. In a monologue asking boys not pelt it with stones to get its fruit, the tree contrasts the formerly fruitful [[golden age]] with the present barren time, in which its fruit is violently ripped off and its branches broken. In the course of this, the tree compares itself to several mythological characters, praises the peace that the emperor provides and prays to be destroyed rather than suffer. The poem is considered spurious because it incorporates allusions to Ovid's works in an uncharacteristic way, although the piece is thought to be contemporary with Ovid.<ref>Knox, P. "Lost" in Knox, P. (2009) pp. 212–13</ref>

===''Somnium'' ("The Dream")===
This poem, traditionally placed at ''Amores'' 3.5, is considered spurious. The poet describes a dream to an interpreter, saying that he sees while escaping from the heat of noon a white heifer near a bull; when the heifer is pecked by a crow, it leaves the bull for a meadow with other bulls. The interpreter interprets the dream as a love allegory; the bull represents the poet, the heifer a girl, and the crow an old woman. The old woman spurs the girl to leave her lover and find someone else. The poem is known to have circulated independently and its lack of engagement with Tibullan or Propertian elegy argue in favor of its spuriousness; however, the poem does seem to be datable to the early empire.<ref>Knox, P. "Lost" in Knox, P. (2009) pp. 210–11</ref>

==Style==
Ovid is traditionally considered the final significant love elegist in the evolution of the genre and one of the most versatile in his handling of the genre's conventions. Like the other canonical elegiac poets Ovid takes on a [[Persona#In literature|persona]] in his works that emphasizes subjectivity and personal emotion over traditional militaristic and public goals, a convention that some scholars link to the relative stability provided by the Augustan settlement.<ref>Ettore Bignone, ''Historia de la literatura latina'' ([[Buenos Aires]]: Losada, 1952), p. 309.</ref><ref>A. Guillemin, "L’élement humain dans l’élégie latine". In: ''Revue des études Latines'' (Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1940), p. 288.</ref> However, although [[Catullus]], [[Tibullus]] and [[Propertius]] may have been inspired in part by personal experience, the validity of "biographical" readings of these poets' works is a serious point of scholarly contention.<ref>In fact, it is generally accepted in most modern classical scholarship on elegy that the poems have little connection to autobiography or external reality. See Wycke, M. "Written Women:Propertius' Scripta Puella" in ''JRS'' 1987 and Davis, J. ''Fictus Adulter: Poet as Auctor in the Amores'' (Amsterdam, 1989) and Booth, J. "The ''Amores'': Ovid Making Love" in ''A Companion to Ovid'' (Oxford, 2009) pp. 70ff.</ref>

Ovid has been seen as taking on a persona in his poetry that is far more emotionally detached from his mistress and less involved in crafting a unique emotional realism within the text than the other elegists.<ref>Booth, J. pp. 66–68. She explains: "The text of the Amores hints at the narrator's lack of interest in depicting unique and personal emotion." p. 67</ref> This attitude, coupled with the lack of testimony that identifies Ovid's Corinna with a real person<ref>Apuleius ''Apology'' 10 provides the real names for every elegist's mistress except Ovid's.</ref> has led scholars to conclude that Corinna was never a real person&nbsp;– and that Ovid's relationship with her is an invention for his elegiac project.<ref>Barsby, J. ''Ovid Amores 1'' (Oxford, 1973) pp.16ff.</ref> Some scholars have even interpreted Corinna as a [[meta#Epistemology|metapoetic]] symbol for the elegiac genre itself.<ref>Keith, A. "Corpus Eroticum: Elegiac Poetics and Elegiac Puellae in Ovid's 'Amores'" in ''Classical World'' (1994) 27–40.</ref>

Ovid has been considered a highly inventive love elegist who plays with traditional elegiac conventions and elaborates the themes of the genre;<ref>Barsby, p. 17.</ref> Quintilian even calls him a "sportive" elegist.<ref name="Quint. Inst. 10.1.93"/> In some poems, he uses traditional conventions in new ways, such as the ''[[paraklausithyron]]'' of ''Am.'' 1.6, while other poems seem to have no elegiac precedents and appear to be Ovid's own generic innovations, such as the poem on Corinna's ruined hair (''Am.'' 1.14).  Ovid has been traditionally seen as far more sexually explicit in his poetry than the other elegists.<ref>Booth, J. p. 65</ref>

His erotic elegy covers a wide spectrum of themes and viewpoints; the ''Amores'' focus on Ovid's relationship with Corinna, the love of [[List of Greek mythological figures|mythical characters]] is the subject of the ''Heroides'', and the ''[[Ars Amatoria]]'' and the other didactic love poems provide a handbook for relationships and seduction from a (mock-)"scientific" viewpoint. In his treatment of elegy, scholars have traced the influence of rhetorical education in his [[enumeration]], in his effects of surprise, and in his transitional devices.<ref>Jean Bayet, ''Literatura latina'' ([[Barcelona]]: Ariel, 1985), p. 278 and Barsby, pp. 23ff.</ref>

Some commentators have also noted the influence of Ovid's interest in love elegy in his other works, such as the ''Fasti,'' and have distinguished his "elegiac" style from his "epic" style. [[Richard Heinze]] in his famous ''Ovids elegische Erzählung'' (1919) delineated the distinction between Ovid's styles by comparing the ''Fasti'' and ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' versions of the same legends, such as the treatment of the [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]]–[[Proserpina]] story in both poems. Heinze demonstrated that, "whereas in the elegiac poems a sentimental and tender tone prevails, the hexameter narrative is characterized by an emphasis on solemnity and awe..."<ref>Quoted by Theodore F. Brunner, "Deinon vs. eleeinon: Heinze Revisited" In: ''The American Journal of Philology'', Vol. 92, No. 2 (Apr. 1971), pp. 275–84.</ref> His general line of argument has been accepted by [[Brooks Otis]], who wrote:

{{quote|The [[List of Roman deities|gods]] are "serious" in epic as they are not in elegy; the speeches in epic are long and infrequent compared to the short, truncated and frequent speeches of elegy; the epic writer conceals himself while the elegiac fills his narrative with familiar remarks to the reader or his characters; above all perhaps, epic narrative is continuous and symmetrical... whereas elegiac narrative displays a marked asymmetry&nbsp;...<ref>[[Brooks Otis]], ''Ovid as an epic poet'' (CUP Archive, 1970), p. 24. {{ISBN|0521076153|978-0521076159}}</ref>}}

Otis wrote that in the Ovidian poems of love, he "was [[Burlesque|burlesquing]] an old theme rather than inventing a new one".<ref name="OtisI">[[Brooks Otis]], ''Ovid as an epic poet'', p. 264.</ref> Otis states that the ''Heroides'' are more serious and, though some of them are "quite different from anything Ovid had done before [...] he is here also treading a very well-worn path" to relate that the motif of females abandoned by or separated from their men was a "stock motif of [[Hellenistic]] and [[neoteric]] poetry (the classic example for us is, of course, [[Catullus 66]])".<ref name="OtisI" />

Otis also states that [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]] and [[Medea]], [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]] and [[Hermione (mythology)|Hermione]] (also present in the poem) "are clever re-touchings of [[Euripides]] and [[Vergil]]".<ref name="OtisI" /> Some scholars, such as Kenney and Clausen, have compared Ovid with Virgil. According to them, Virgil was ambiguous and ambivalent while Ovid was defined and, while Ovid wrote only what he could express, Virgil wrote for the use of [[language]].<ref>Kenney, E. J. y ClausenL, W. V. ''História de la literatura clásica'' (Cambridge University), vol. II. ''Literatura Latina''. [[Madrid]]: Gredos, w/d, p. 502.</ref>

==Legacy==

===Criticism===
[[Image:Ovide moralisé.jpg|thumb|200px|A 1484 figure from ''Ovide Moralisé'', edition by Colard Mansion.]]
Ovid's works have been interpreted in various ways over the centuries with attitudes that depended on the social, religious and literary contexts of different times. It is known that since his own lifetime, he was already famous and criticized. In the ''[[Remedia Amoris]]'', Ovid reports criticism from people who considered his books insolent.<ref>Ov. ''Rem''. VI, 6.</ref> Ovid responded to this criticism with the following:
<poem style="margin-left:2em">
Gluttonous Envy, burst: my name’s well known already
it will be more so, if only my feet travel the road they’ve started.
But you’re in too much of a hurry: if I live you’ll be more than sorry:
many poems, in fact, are forming in my mind.<ref>Ov. ''Rem''. VI, 33–36. Translated by A. S. Kline and available in [http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/CuresforLove.htm Ovid: Cures for Love] (2001).</ref>
</poem>

After such criticism subsided, Ovid became one of the best known and most loved Roman poets during the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]].<ref name="PeterXIII">See chapters II and IV in P. Gatti, Ovid in Antike und Mittelalter. Geschichte der philologischen Rezeption, Stuttgart 2014, {{ISBN|978-3515103756}}; Peter Green (trad.), ''The poems of exile: Tristia and the Black Sea letters'' ([[University of California Press]], 2005), p. xiii. {{ISBN|0520242602|978-0520242609}}</ref>

Writers in the Middle Ages used his work as a way to read and write about [[sex]] and [[violence]] without orthodox "scrutiny routinely given to commentaries on the [[Bible]]".<ref>Robert Levine, "Exploiting Ovid: Medieval Allegorizations of the Metamorphoses," ''Medioevo Romanzo'' XIV (1989), pp.  197–213.</ref> In the Middle Ages the voluminous ''[[:fr:L'Ovide moralisé|Ovide moralisé]]'', a French work that moralizes 15 books of the ''Metamorphoses'' was composed. This work then influenced [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]. Ovid's poetry provided inspiration for the Renaissance idea of [[Renaissance humanism|humanism]], and more specifically, for many Renaissance painters and writers.

Likewise, [[Arthur Golding]] moralized his own translation of the full 15 books, and published it in 1567. This version was the same version used as a supplement to the original Latin in the Tudor-era grammar schools that influenced such major Renaissance authors as [[Christopher Marlowe]] and [[William Shakespeare]]. Many non-English authors were heavily influenced by Ovid's works as well. [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]], for example, alluded to Ovid several times in his ''[[Essais]]'', specifically in his comments on ''Education of Children'' when he says:

{{quote|The first taste I had for books came to me from my pleasure in the fables of the ''Metamorphoses'' of Ovid. For at about seven or eight years of age I would steal away from any other pleasure to read them, inasmuch as this language was my mother tongue, and it was the easiest book I knew and the best suited by its content to my tender age.<ref>[[Michel de Montaigne]], ''The complete essays of Montaigne'' (translated by Donald M. Frame), [[Stanford University Press]] 1958, p. 130. {{ISBN|0804704864|978-0804704861}}</ref>}} [[Miguel de Cervantes]] also used the ''Metamorphoses'' as a platform of inspiration for his prodigious novel ''[[Don Quixote]].''

[[File:Eugène Delacroix - Ovide chez les Scythes (1859).jpg|thumb|280px|[[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]], ''[[Ovid among the Scythians]]'', 1859. [[National Gallery (London)]].]]

In the 16th century, some [[Jesuit]] schools of [[Portugal]] cut several passages from Ovid's ''Metamorphoses''. While the Jesuits saw his poems as elegant compositions worthy of being presented to students for educational purposes, they also felt his works as a whole might corrupt students.<ref>Agostinho de Jesus Domingues, ''Os Clássicos Latinos nas Antologias Escolares dos Jesuítas nos Primeiros Ciclos de Estudos Pré-Elementares No Século XVI em Portugal'' (Faculdade de Letras da [[Universidade do Porto]], 2002), [[Porto]], pp. 16–17.</ref> The Jesuits took much of their knowledge of Ovid to the Portuguese colonies. According to Serafim Leite (1949), the ''[[ratio studiorum]]'' was in effect in [[Colonial Brazil]] during the early 17th century, and in this period Brazilian students read works like the ''[[Epistulae ex Ponto]]'' to learn [[Latin]] [[grammar]].<ref>Serafim da Silva Leite, ''História da Companhia de Jesus no Brasil''. [[Rio de Janeiro]], Instituto Nacional do Livro, 1949, pp. 151–52 – Tomo VII.</ref>

In Spain, Ovid is both praised and criticized by Cervantes in his ''Don Quixote'', where he warns against satires that can exile poets, as happened to Ovid.<ref>Frederick A. De Armas, ''Ovid in the Age of Cervantes'' (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2010), pp. 11–12.</ref> In the 16th century, Ovid's works were criticized in England. The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] and the [[Bishop of London]] ordered that a contemporary translation of Ovid's love poems be [[Bishops' Ban of 1599|publicly burned in 1599]]. The [[Puritan]]s of the following century viewed Ovid as [[pagan]], thus as an [[immoral]] influence.<ref>Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'', Alan H. F. Griffin, ''Greece & Rome'', Second Series, Vol. 24, No. 1 (Apr. 1977), pp. 57–70. Cambridge University Press.</ref>

[[John Dryden]] composed a famous translation of the ''Metamorphoses'' into stopped rhyming couplets during the 17th century, when Ovid was "refashioned [...] in its own image, one kind of Augustanism making over another".<ref name="PeterXIII" /> The [[Romantic movement]] of the 19th century, in contrast, considered Ovid and his poems "stuffy, dull, over-formalized and lacking in genuine passion".<ref name="PeterXIII" /> Romantics might have preferred his poetry of exile.<ref>Peter Green (trad.), ''The poems of exile: Tristia and the Black Sea letters'' (University of California Press, 2005), p. xiv. {{ISBN|0520242602|978-0520242609}}</ref>

==Notes==
{{Refbegin}}
* '''a.''' {{Note label|a|a|none}} The [[cognomen]] ''Naso'' means "the one with the [[:wikt:nasus#Latin|nose]]" (i.e. "Bignose"). Ovid habitually refers to himself by his nickname in his poetry because the Latin name ''Ovidius'' does not fit into [[Elegiac couplet|elegiac metre]].
* '''b.''' {{Note label|b|b|none}} It was a pivotal year in the [[history of Rome]]. A year before Ovid's birth, the murder of [[Julius Caesar]] took place, an event that precipitated the end of the [[Republican Rome|republican]] regime. After Caesar's death, a series of civil wars and alliances followed (See [[Roman civil wars]]), until the victory of Caesar's nephew, Octavius (later called [[Augustus]]) over [[Mark Antony]] (leading supporter of Caesar), from which arose a new political order.<ref>{{in lang|pt}} ''Met.'', Ovid, translation to [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] by Paulo Farmhouse Alberto, Livros Cotovia, Intro, p. 11.</ref>
* '''c.''' {{Note label|c|c|none}} ''Fasti'' is, in fact, unfinished. ''Metamorphoses'' was already completed in the year of exile, missing only the final revision.<ref>Carlos de Miguel Moura. ''O mistério do exílio ovidiano''. In Portuguese. In: ''Àgora. Estudos Clássicos em Debate 4'' (2002), pp. 99–117.</ref> In exile, Ovid said he never gave a final review on the poem.<ref>''Tristia'' 1, 7, 14.</ref>
* '''d.''' {{Note label|d|d|none}} Ovid cites [[Scythia]] in I 64, II 224, V 649, VII 407, VIII 788, XV 285, 359, 460, and others.
