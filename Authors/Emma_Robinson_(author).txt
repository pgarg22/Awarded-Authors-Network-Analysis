'''Emma Robinson''' (1814 &ndash; 18 December 1890) was an English writer. All of her works were published anonymously or using [[pseudonym]]s.

The daughter of Joseph Robinson, a bookseller, she was born in [[London]]. In 1844, she published ''Whitefriars, or, The Days of Charles the Second: an Historical Romance'', a [[historical fiction|historical novel]], and ''Richelieu in Love'', a historical play. She published seven more historical novels from 1844 to 1849 and seven more from 1854 to 1865. She also published five critiques of the society of the time, beginning with ''The Gold-Worshippers, or, The Days we Live in: a Future Historical Novel'' in 1851. In 1858, she published ''Mauleverer's Divorce, or, The Story of a Woman's Wrongs'', which dealt with issues raised by the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1857]]. Her 1862 novel ''Which Wins, Love or Money?'' provided much of the content for [[Henry Thornton Craven]]'s play ''Philomel''.<ref name=odnb>{{cite ODNB |id=40240 |title=Robinson, Emma |first=Anne |last=Humpherys}}</ref> In 1848, she published a second play ''The Revolt of Flanders, An Historical Tragedy in Five Acts''.<ref name=orlando/>

The performance of Robinson's play ''Richelieu in Love'', already in rehearsal, was prohibited by the [[Lord Chamberlain]]'s office in 1844 because it dealt with [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], then viewed as a forbidden topic. A revised version of the play was licensed for performance in 1852.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ls8CP4MZV9oC&pg=PA48 |title=The Censorship of English Drama 1824-1901 |pages=48â€“50 |first=John Russell |last=Stephens |year=2010 |isbn=978-0521136556}}</ref>

In 1862, she was granted a [[civil list]] pension. She published ''The Matrimonial Vanity Fair'', a critique of the matrimonial market and her last published work, in 1867.<ref name=odnb/>

She died in [[Norwood Green]] at the age of 76 at the [[St Bernard's Hospital, Hanwell|London County Lunatic Asylum]] due to [[bronchitis]], heart disease and [[cirrhosis]].<ref name=odnb/><ref name=orlando>{{cite web |url=http://orlando.cambridge.org/public/svPeople?person_id=robiem |title=Emma Robinson |work=The Orlando Project |publisher=Cambridge University}}</ref>
